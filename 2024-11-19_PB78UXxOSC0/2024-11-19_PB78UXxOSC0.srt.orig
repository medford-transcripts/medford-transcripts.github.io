00:11:25,694 --> 00:11:35,661
[SPEAKER_08]: I do believe we have the petitioner here, if we would like to hear from him first, and then we can go to Councilor Scarpelli, Chair of Licensing, unless we'd like to start with you, Councilor Scarpelli.

181
00:11:41,029 --> 00:11:44,572
[SPEAKER_06]: Can the petition just let us know what this process is?

182
00:11:44,672 --> 00:11:47,135
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it leaving ownership?

183
00:11:47,215 --> 00:11:51,318
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it just staying within the ownership of different people within the system?

184
00:11:51,338 --> 00:11:53,640
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, how are you?

185
00:11:54,601 --> 00:11:57,903
[SPEAKER_04]: So for now, it's just the change of the ownership.

186
00:11:57,983 --> 00:12:02,327
[SPEAKER_04]: So I have been working over there for three years, and now we are changing just the ownership.

187
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:03,468
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to be the new owner.

188
00:12:03,488 --> 00:12:05,990

[SPEAKER_16]: So instead of me going through this whole presentation, you're just requesting that I do an overview of where we are and what needs to occur this evening?

253
00:15:41,497 --> 00:15:41,757
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

254
00:15:42,477 --> 00:15:42,897
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

255
00:15:43,918 --> 00:15:47,460
[SPEAKER_16]: So annually, I'm so sorry.

256
00:15:48,564 --> 00:15:49,385
[SPEAKER_06]: No, go ahead, I'm sorry.

257

259
00:15:53,532 --> 00:15:56,276
[SPEAKER_16]: If you can go ahead and make me a co-host.

260
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:58,019
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Clerk, if you could do that.

261
00:15:59,241 --> 00:15:59,802
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

262
00:15:59,822 --> 00:16:02,306
[SPEAKER_09]: All set.

263
00:16:02,326 --> 00:16:02,406
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

264
00:16:15,021 --> 00:16:15,501
[SPEAKER_09]: There we go.

265
00:16:16,021 --> 00:16:18,402
[SPEAKER_16]: Is that all up and above everybody can see that?

266
00:16:19,102 --> 00:16:19,303
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

267
00:16:20,003 --> 00:16:20,283
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

268
00:16:20,763 --> 00:16:32,647
[SPEAKER_16]: So, as we know this is an annual event that the city council is to adopt the city's tax policy by allocating the tax levy or classifying it among the property types.

269
00:16:33,308 --> 00:16:38,389
[SPEAKER_16]: So I, you know, this is something that's done every year it Medford.

270
00:16:41,423 --> 00:16:55,033
[SPEAKER_16]: has historically shifted the tax rate from a single tax rate to a shift of the 175%, which is allows the shift of the levy from the residential class to the commercial industrial and personal property class.

271
00:16:55,793 --> 00:17:05,881
[SPEAKER_16]: Also annually you vote on the residential exemption and the small commercial exemption, both of which have historically not been done for the city of Medford.

272
00:17:07,023 --> 00:17:23,193
[SPEAKER_16]: And so, here we are, we're looking at fiscal 23, the Board of Assessors received certification of our new values that we used sales from calendar year 2021 to set the assessments.

273
00:17:24,034 --> 00:17:29,257
[SPEAKER_16]: And those were approved by the Department of Revenue on November 22nd.

274
00:17:30,158 --> 00:17:32,559
[SPEAKER_16]: So the slide just does the brief overview.

275
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:35,081
[SPEAKER_16]: Statistically, we meet the standards.

276
00:17:37,472 --> 00:17:40,774
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, we're blessed to have a lot of sales in Medford.

277
00:17:41,014 --> 00:17:52,100
[SPEAKER_16]: And so for this calendar year, we had, I think it was over 798 arm's length transactions that allowed us to build the new model and set value.

278
00:17:53,701 --> 00:17:56,122
[SPEAKER_16]: Our average assessments have increased.

279
00:17:56,963 --> 00:18:01,745
[SPEAKER_16]: Everybody knows what the market's done and it continued to be strong all the way through calendar year 2021.

280
00:18:01,825 --> 00:18:05,187
[SPEAKER_16]: We're still seeing, you know, we saw that through most of 2022.

281
00:18:07,349 --> 00:18:19,181
[SPEAKER_16]: never been a good fortune teller so I don't know what the future is going to bring for those but quite, you know, we certainly are in a good position for property owners in the city of Medford, having their property hold value.

282
00:18:21,927 --> 00:18:28,591
[SPEAKER_16]: In addition, you can see that compared to the surrounding communities, we are also very strong in our values.

283
00:18:28,891 --> 00:18:37,116
[SPEAKER_16]: Historically, this is not the first year where our average assessments increased more than what the other communities did.

284
00:18:37,657 --> 00:18:45,682
[SPEAKER_16]: So single family, we're at an increase of 9.79, other communities not quite, but when you look at that comparison, you also know

285
00:18:46,382 --> 00:18:51,585
[SPEAKER_16]: a single family home in Cambridge is certainly much higher than a single family home in Medford.

286
00:18:51,665 --> 00:18:57,508
[SPEAKER_16]: So Medford, desirable place to raise your family, your home values are stable, and that's a good story.

287
00:18:59,949 --> 00:19:05,492
[SPEAKER_16]: We also have and are enjoying a really nice year two of strong growth.

288
00:19:06,072 --> 00:19:11,856
[SPEAKER_16]: Coming out of COVID, we were worried and that has continued to be a good story with 2.2 million in

289
00:19:13,261 --> 00:19:18,485
[SPEAKER_16]: tax levy growth, that levy growth is based on fiscal 22 tax rates.

290
00:19:19,886 --> 00:19:26,410
[SPEAKER_16]: And these slides just show, just breaks this down a little bit better for you where those numbers come from.

291
00:19:28,352 --> 00:19:33,936
[SPEAKER_16]: Personal property continues to shock me every time that it's gonna grow the way it is.

292
00:19:35,617 --> 00:19:40,520
[SPEAKER_16]: And we're seeing this year, stronger commercial growth

293
00:19:41,837 --> 00:19:43,218
[SPEAKER_16]: than it has been historically.

294
00:19:43,298 --> 00:19:46,539
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's a nice trend for Medford.

295
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:59,905
[SPEAKER_16]: That commercial growth, point out like number one Cabot with lab space, 87 Medford Street with its mixed use, all those things.

296
00:20:00,325 --> 00:20:03,367
[SPEAKER_16]: And then again, those personal property accounts bringing in growth.

297
00:20:05,006 --> 00:20:16,978
[SPEAKER_16]: We are still a bedroom community residential 89% of the total value of the city is in residential versus those commercial industrial and personal property values.

298
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:26,628
[SPEAKER_16]: And again, this is just another slide that shows the historical nice trend to see, you know, it's been.

299
00:20:29,688 --> 00:20:40,443
[SPEAKER_16]: We've been, we need to start creeping back up so this year, you know, commercial percentage of levy has gone up a tech from where it was last year, in comparison to residential.

300
00:20:42,586 --> 00:20:45,110
[SPEAKER_16]: If we had a single tax rate.

301
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,521
[SPEAKER_16]: It would have been 946, I see a typo as I look at that.

302
00:20:50,601 --> 00:20:52,562
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's 946 at a single rate.

303
00:20:53,182 --> 00:21:03,325
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, Medford has historically a mixed split rate with 8.65 in residential and 1656 on the commercial, industrial and personal property.

304
00:21:03,765 --> 00:21:10,687
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, estimates they'll change by pennies potentially when the state is done looking at our tax recaps.

305
00:21:12,547 --> 00:21:13,828
[SPEAKER_16]: So again, if we,

306
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:25,011
[SPEAKER_16]: follow historical trends, you're gonna be voting to use the minimum residential factor of the 91.426, that will give us that split tax rate.

307
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:33,054
[SPEAKER_16]: And this is just another breakdown, so I'm gonna keep going.

308
00:21:35,253 --> 00:21:46,143
[SPEAKER_16]: And this one I can't see as well because my screen is blocked, but this just tells you the average single tax rate and what that does in comparison to the split rate versus a single rate.

309
00:21:47,585 --> 00:21:56,433
[SPEAKER_16]: So average values increased, our average tax bills potentially for a single family home will go up about $300 this year.

310
00:21:56,453 --> 00:21:58,615
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, that's on an average.

311
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:13,081
[SPEAKER_16]: And we talk every year about the residential exemption at this point in time, as I've indicated before, it's too late in the year for the city council to vote on that.

312
00:22:13,782 --> 00:22:26,490
[SPEAKER_16]: I would suggest again, like you did last year, hopefully, we'll visit it again and see what those numbers look like with fiscal 23 calculations to give you a benchmark for fiscal 24.

313
00:22:28,873 --> 00:22:36,841
[SPEAKER_16]: And then as we talk about every year, the small commercial exemption, really it benefits the property owner, not those small businesses.

314
00:22:37,081 --> 00:22:41,806
[SPEAKER_16]: And historically this council has chosen not to entertain that exemption.

315
00:22:43,748 --> 00:22:50,515
[SPEAKER_16]: So the summary is that the vote will split the tax rate for the small commercial business.

316
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,361
[SPEAKER_16]: again, favoring the residential property.

317
00:22:55,181 --> 00:23:01,284
[SPEAKER_16]: And then you vote whether or not to adopt the residential exemption and whether or not to vote on the small commercial exemption.

318
00:23:02,764 --> 00:23:05,625
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's my PowerPoint in a nutshell there.

319
00:23:05,765 --> 00:23:06,185
[SPEAKER_16]: There we go.

320
00:23:06,365 --> 00:23:11,968
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm gonna try to stop sharing my screen and entertain any questions.

321
00:23:12,008 --> 00:23:13,208
[SPEAKER_16]: I hope I didn't go too fast.

322
00:23:16,289 --> 00:23:16,869
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Ellen.

323
00:23:17,149 --> 00:23:18,390
[SPEAKER_08]: Going to Vice President Behrs.

324
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,106
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Madam President.

325
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:21,829
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Ellen.

326
00:23:23,258 --> 00:23:24,479
[SPEAKER_17]: Thanks for the presentation.

327
00:23:24,979 --> 00:23:28,662
[SPEAKER_17]: Just wanted to kind of have two quick lines of questioning here.

328
00:23:29,383 --> 00:23:42,593
[SPEAKER_17]: But first, I just want to also remind everybody that we had a meeting over the summer where we did go really into depth on a lot of property tax exemptions, the residential exemption with Assessor Bordeaux.

329
00:23:42,713 --> 00:23:50,459
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm not going to ask the questions that I asked at that meeting again, but that's a good meeting recording to refer back to for folks.

330
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:53,501
[SPEAKER_17]: where we did dive into that in a little more detail.

331
00:23:55,002 --> 00:23:56,423
[SPEAKER_17]: Just two things, Ellen.

332
00:23:56,743 --> 00:24:12,571
[SPEAKER_17]: One, on the average growth rate of assessments versus average growth rate of the average tax bill, I noticed that average assessments are going up significantly faster than the average tax bill itself.

333
00:24:14,272 --> 00:24:17,834
[SPEAKER_17]: And I just wanted to confirm with you, that's attributable to Proposition 2.5, correct?

334
00:24:20,262 --> 00:24:30,831
[SPEAKER_16]: Correct, I mean, yeah, because the values, obviously everyone's values are gonna be what the market dictates, but the tax levy is constrained by prop two and a half.

335
00:24:31,591 --> 00:24:39,698
[SPEAKER_16]: And this council and the administration for the city of Medford have always been very conservative in taking care of not to overspend.

336
00:24:39,858 --> 00:24:42,060
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's the reflection of that.

337
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:47,144
[SPEAKER_16]: Your property values are going up, but your tax bill is not going up proportionately.

338
00:24:48,358 --> 00:24:49,098
[SPEAKER_17]: Great.

339
00:24:50,119 --> 00:25:08,786
[SPEAKER_17]: And yeah, along those lines, I just wanted to also to make a point of note for folks that the because of that the tax rate is going down again right we're dropping from, I just want to confirm we're dropping from 9.18 per thousand to 8.65 for residential Is that correct.

340
00:25:09,663 --> 00:25:15,184
[SPEAKER_16]: I thought it was 901, but you could be- 901 sounds right, my apologies.

341
00:25:15,204 --> 00:25:15,665
[SPEAKER_16]: 901, right.

342
00:25:16,265 --> 00:25:16,865
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, you are.

343
00:25:17,005 --> 00:25:20,606
[SPEAKER_16]: So again, a great story to come down.

344
00:25:22,506 --> 00:25:26,847
[SPEAKER_16]: It's that I sleep better at night, high property value, low tax rate.

345
00:25:26,887 --> 00:25:29,588
[SPEAKER_16]: So I hope everybody in Medford's gonna sleep better knowing that too.

346
00:25:31,544 --> 00:25:32,045
[SPEAKER_17]: Thanks, Ellen.

347
00:25:32,065 --> 00:25:40,502
[SPEAKER_17]: And then just finally, so what we're adding here is we're adding the 2.5% minimum plus that $2.2 million in new growth, and that's what's being added to the levy.

348
00:25:41,177 --> 00:25:42,758
[SPEAKER_16]: That's correct.

349
00:25:42,938 --> 00:25:56,750
[SPEAKER_16]: And we're not, as your finance director, Mr. Dickinson has done a very good job of making sure that we're not right up to that levy ceiling.

350
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:59,392
[SPEAKER_16]: We're not raising absolutely every penny.

351
00:26:00,253 --> 00:26:01,774
[SPEAKER_16]: It's absolutely where it should be.

352
00:26:02,354 --> 00:26:05,777
[SPEAKER_16]: For rounding and everything, that's the number you end up with.

353
00:26:07,098 --> 00:26:07,399
[SPEAKER_17]: Great.

354
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:09,120
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you very much, Alan.

355
00:26:11,498 --> 00:26:14,219
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you by Susan bears going to counselors, garb.

356
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,440
[SPEAKER_08]: Kelly, I believe saw Hannah.

357
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:16,940
[SPEAKER_08]: Here we go.

358
00:26:17,721 --> 00:26:18,821
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I appreciate it.

359
00:26:18,881 --> 00:26:22,283
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I think that Ellen.

360
00:26:22,303 --> 00:26:30,806
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that Ellen has just always explained where people have asked for that.

361
00:26:32,578 --> 00:26:39,825
[SPEAKER_06]: the exemption for residential and how that impacts our community if we went that way.

362
00:26:39,885 --> 00:26:50,154
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that you always had a statement that really just summarized it and really helped people understand why it's not really a good fit right now.

363
00:26:50,214 --> 00:26:52,096
[SPEAKER_06]: So can you just elaborate on that?

364
00:26:54,068 --> 00:27:04,310
[SPEAKER_16]: Certainly, counselor I for Medford you are a bedroom community and you have, you know, a large percentage of your homes over what they consider that break even point.

365
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:15,272
[SPEAKER_16]: So, people below the break even point might get a break, but the people above the break even point would can see it would see a significant increase in their tax bill depending on where they are.

366
00:27:15,993 --> 00:27:17,313
[SPEAKER_16]: And I always go back to.

367
00:27:18,193 --> 00:27:32,584
[SPEAKER_16]: The analogy of it, it's all it does is shift within your residential so you're you're hurting your people within your with your same class of property, it doesn't make a raise an extra dime on commercial, it goes within the residential class.

368
00:27:33,344 --> 00:27:45,074
[SPEAKER_16]: The other thing it does, and Medford wants to have affordable housing, and affordable housing is through those landlords that own multifamilies and own apartment buildings.

369
00:27:45,374 --> 00:27:54,541
[SPEAKER_16]: If you do a residential exemption, those apartment buildings and your multifamilies are going to see an increase in taxation that they're going to pass on to the renter.

370
00:27:55,242 --> 00:28:01,546
[SPEAKER_16]: That's truly, that's in a nutshell, you know, a quick why it doesn't really work for Medford.

371
00:28:01,566 --> 00:28:14,135
[SPEAKER_16]: It works great in vacation communities or in communities like our neighbors that are very much, you know, they don't mind passing it all on to the renters and that's what they do in Cambridge and in Boston.

372
00:28:14,215 --> 00:28:16,417
[SPEAKER_16]: It's, you know, they're

373
00:28:18,043 --> 00:28:20,665
[SPEAKER_16]: want to ship that over to those groups.

374
00:28:21,625 --> 00:28:23,146
[SPEAKER_06]: That's exactly what I wanted to hear.

375
00:28:23,166 --> 00:28:25,267
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to make sure that that's a brief understanding.

376
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:26,748
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you again for all your hard work.

377
00:28:27,268 --> 00:28:29,009
[SPEAKER_06]: And we really thank you.

378
00:28:30,871 --> 00:28:31,791
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

379
00:28:31,991 --> 00:28:33,472
[SPEAKER_08]: Any further discussion from the council?

380
00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:38,995
[SPEAKER_08]: And I do just want to note this is a public hearing on this paper.

381
00:28:39,055 --> 00:28:41,197
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm just going to officially open the public hearing.

382
00:28:42,597 --> 00:28:47,861
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeing no additional questions from the council at this time, are there any members of the public who would like to speak?

383
00:28:48,441 --> 00:28:50,383
[SPEAKER_09]: Please raise your hand.

384
00:28:55,907 --> 00:28:57,068
[SPEAKER_09]: On this paper specifically.

385
00:28:57,088 --> 00:29:04,914
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyone who would like to speak on the public hearing on the tax paper for us?

386
00:29:04,934 --> 00:29:06,996
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

387
00:29:07,977 --> 00:29:09,177
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeing none, do I have,

388
00:29:10,937 --> 00:29:16,722
[SPEAKER_08]: a motion on the table or I can close this portion of the public hearing and then drive a motion from a counselor.

389
00:29:19,444 --> 00:29:21,485
[SPEAKER_08]: So actually, sorry, we have to go through, I apologize.

390
00:29:21,505 --> 00:29:22,606
[SPEAKER_08]: We have to go through each question.

391
00:29:24,107 --> 00:29:27,550
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that something counselors is something we want to go on tonight?

392
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:30,953
[SPEAKER_08]: Would we like to carry it over to a future meeting counselor Collins?

393
00:29:38,251 --> 00:29:45,618
[SPEAKER_15]: President Merle and I motioned a table, so that we can we can take this up in person at a subsequent meeting.

394
00:29:47,399 --> 00:29:50,662
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Collins motion, I think it's wise choice.

395
00:29:51,423 --> 00:29:57,568
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think it'd be valuable for people to be able to come in next week, if they have any ideas.

396
00:29:59,193 --> 00:29:59,913
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, counselors.

397
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:08,475
[SPEAKER_08]: And then just seeing Allen Bordeaux, I saw you had your hand up and I also just want to confirm that timing would be okay if this were to be voted on next week as far as the time we need to vote on this by.

398
00:30:08,495 --> 00:30:14,276
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm concerned about the timing because it does still have to be approved.

399
00:30:14,356 --> 00:30:19,657
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, certainly you're earlier in the year, but I am not available next Tuesday night.

400
00:30:19,897 --> 00:30:20,677
[SPEAKER_16]: I apologize.

401
00:30:20,717 --> 00:30:27,798
[SPEAKER_16]: And then pushing it further out, but I have my, I'm already have a commitment.

402
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:31,362
[SPEAKER_16]: So I, and I just want to let you know that.

403
00:30:31,462 --> 00:30:42,629
[SPEAKER_16]: So my only this, this, um, this vote tonight, really, you're really looking at the, whether or not you're going to split a tax rate.

404
00:30:42,829 --> 00:30:51,755
[SPEAKER_16]: And I don't know if that was, you know, so it's not like there would be doing any changes to the tax rate or anything else, unless you didn't split the tax rate.

405
00:30:53,199 --> 00:31:05,216
[SPEAKER_16]: So timing wise if the city doesn't have the, the other thing is, and I feel like I put you in this position but I'm going to take a little bit of it is that if we don't have the tax rate.

406
00:31:06,478 --> 00:31:25,969
[SPEAKER_16]: set and completed, then we jeopardize getting those tax bills out on time so for for any delay in this tight timeframe that we're in, it's going to push me against the wall to get those final files over to the collector for her to get that data out and get it to the billing company in time.

407
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:30,571
[SPEAKER_08]: Put them in a manner present the information counselor night.

408
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:36,531
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm understanding you're working in a part-time capacity here in this community, right?

409
00:31:36,551 --> 00:31:42,772
[SPEAKER_13]: And that you've moved on, you've left Medford and you're working in another neighboring community at this point in time as well.

410
00:31:43,793 --> 00:31:44,653
[SPEAKER_16]: That's correct.

411
00:31:45,293 --> 00:31:50,294
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm a full-time employee for another city and I'm- So you haven't put us in any position.

412
00:31:50,334 --> 00:31:52,115
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't want you to feel like you have, because you haven't.

413
00:31:52,935 --> 00:31:53,255
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

414
00:31:53,435 --> 00:31:55,696
[SPEAKER_13]: It's through no doing of your own.

415
00:31:56,076 --> 00:32:00,397
[SPEAKER_13]: If it weren't for you being here this evening, we probably wouldn't even have this paper before us.

416
00:32:01,137 --> 00:32:01,417
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

417
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:04,013
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, so thank you for being willing.

418
00:32:04,634 --> 00:32:04,895
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

419
00:32:04,935 --> 00:32:06,898
[SPEAKER_13]: Be willing to continue to carry the torch.

420
00:32:07,584 --> 00:32:10,706
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, we've had a revolving door personnel issues that I'm going on in city hall.

421
00:32:10,766 --> 00:32:11,226
[SPEAKER_13]: You've seen it.

422
00:32:12,467 --> 00:32:13,928
[SPEAKER_13]: And ultimately, you know what I mean?

423
00:32:14,048 --> 00:32:21,453
[SPEAKER_13]: If you weren't good enough to come forward and to be here and to be willing to do this, you and Ted, I don't know where we'd be.

424
00:32:21,833 --> 00:32:23,094
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, I really don't know where we'd be.

425
00:32:23,714 --> 00:32:26,136
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you for being willing to do that.

426
00:32:27,116 --> 00:32:30,719
[SPEAKER_13]: I, as one member of this body, am comfortable doing what we always do.

427
00:32:30,959 --> 00:32:31,940
[SPEAKER_13]: It hasn't hurt us in the past.

428
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:35,184
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just more comfortable taking a tax vote in person.

429
00:32:37,405 --> 00:32:39,625
[SPEAKER_13]: I understand what we're doing here tonight.

430
00:32:39,785 --> 00:32:43,946
[SPEAKER_13]: We've done it, and I've done it 10 times before, and I'd be happy to do it 10 times again.

431
00:32:44,806 --> 00:32:52,708
[SPEAKER_13]: So with that being said, even if we table it this evening and bring it back up next week, I, as one member of the council, wouldn't have any questions for you.

432
00:32:52,748 --> 00:32:58,869
[SPEAKER_13]: I think you did a good job with the presentation, and it's really pro forma at this point.

433
00:32:59,389 --> 00:33:02,130
[SPEAKER_13]: We do this setting of the tax rate every year,

434
00:33:02,637 --> 00:33:05,880
[SPEAKER_13]: And the setting of this tax rate really supports the budget that had just been passed.

435
00:33:06,361 --> 00:33:11,386
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, so all we're doing is really funding the measures that we've, we're setting the tax rate to fund the measures that we've approved.

436
00:33:11,827 --> 00:33:20,476
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, I think that, you know, six one half a dozen or the other, but in terms of the job you've done here and the position that you think you put us in, you haven't put us in any position at all.

437
00:33:20,976 --> 00:33:24,460
[SPEAKER_13]: And I wish you the best in pursuing better opportunities for yourself and your family.

438
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:35,629
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, thank you counselor I truly, I went to this position for to complete, I loved working for the city of Medford, I liked working with this council, and this administration.

439
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:37,991
[SPEAKER_16]: It was personal choice for me.

440
00:33:39,262 --> 00:33:40,742
[SPEAKER_16]: But there is such a shortage.

441
00:33:41,022 --> 00:33:42,483
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not just assessing.

442
00:33:42,623 --> 00:33:46,944
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, the role I took in my new community was without their assessor for over a year.

443
00:33:47,544 --> 00:33:49,985
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's universally, there's just not enough.

444
00:33:50,025 --> 00:33:53,245
[SPEAKER_16]: And as you know, I teach assessing courses.

445
00:33:53,846 --> 00:34:00,327
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm bringing up a new group and boy, do I plug, go to work in Medford, because it's a great place, but we haven't gotten anybody yet.

446
00:34:00,387 --> 00:34:01,047
[SPEAKER_16]: We're working.

447
00:34:01,267 --> 00:34:03,068
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm definitely promoting you.

448
00:34:05,128 --> 00:34:05,688
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Ellen.

449
00:34:05,708 --> 00:34:06,729
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

450
00:34:06,769 --> 00:34:08,289
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for coming to the rescue once again.

451
00:34:10,431 --> 00:34:11,092
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councillor Knight.

452
00:34:11,312 --> 00:34:27,827
[SPEAKER_08]: And to Councillor Knight's point, I guess if Councillors have questions in the meantime, if we could just collect them before next Tuesday's meeting, I too would feel, as Councillor Knight said, a lot of this is pro forma, but I think I would feel more comfortable just having that in-person opportunity for folks to come out and speak, extenuating circumstances that we're on Zoom tonight.

453
00:34:28,207 --> 00:34:31,250
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just want to, you know, have that opportunity for folks to come out and speak.

454
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:32,951
[SPEAKER_08]: So I appreciate it, Ellen.

455
00:34:34,511 --> 00:34:40,134
[SPEAKER_08]: So on the motion of Councilor Collins to table as seconded by Councilor Knight, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

456
00:34:41,594 --> 00:34:43,695
[SPEAKER_08]: Vice-President Behrs.

457
00:34:44,375 --> 00:34:48,057
[SPEAKER_17]: Could we table for one week so it appears on the regular agenda next week?

458
00:34:50,318 --> 00:34:50,718
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.

459
00:34:51,278 --> 00:34:55,400
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the question I was asking when it was tabled to December 6th.

460
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:55,880
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

461
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:59,862

[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

467
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:17,540
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor night.

468
00:35:18,081 --> 00:35:18,341
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

469
00:35:18,941 --> 00:35:19,662
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll just go belly.

470
00:35:20,282 --> 00:35:22,383
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, not just saying, Yes.

471
00:35:23,404 --> 00:35:24,005
[SPEAKER_07]: President Morrell.

472
00:35:24,765 --> 00:35:28,928
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, seven in front of us doing the negative emotion passes the paper is tabled for one week.

473
00:35:30,035 --> 00:35:35,256
[SPEAKER_08]: Motions, orders, and resolutions offered by Councilor 22-578 offered by Councilor Carvalho.

474
00:35:35,396 --> 00:35:44,378
[SPEAKER_08]: Be it so resolved that the Medford City Council have our DPW director and city engineer appear before the council and discuss the substandard paving of Winthrop Street by our source.

475
00:35:45,218 --> 00:35:46,318
[SPEAKER_08]: Going to Councilor Carvalho.

476
00:35:46,998 --> 00:35:48,238
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Madam President.

477
00:35:48,718 --> 00:35:55,760
[SPEAKER_05]: For those of you who haven't had the opportunity to drive down Winthrop Street and see the paving, it's not very good.

478
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,420
[SPEAKER_05]: Winthrop Street is a major street.

479
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:03,182
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's been disrupted for the last five, six years that I can remember.

480
00:36:03,802 --> 00:36:06,664
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is our one crack to get this street paved right.

481
00:36:07,164 --> 00:36:10,206
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you go by now, you see the seams are coming apart.

482
00:36:10,246 --> 00:36:12,907
[SPEAKER_05]: You see patchwork in front of the high school.

483
00:36:14,348 --> 00:36:18,730
[SPEAKER_05]: This is not the job that I'm looking for, for this major road.

484
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:25,373
[SPEAKER_05]: We're gonna be lucky if this road gets two winters before we're paving it out of our own pocket.

485
00:36:26,334 --> 00:36:28,695
[SPEAKER_05]: Eversource needs to do a much better job than they're doing.

486
00:36:29,143 --> 00:36:34,485
[SPEAKER_05]: Go drive a half a mile down the street to Winchester and look at their paving.

487
00:36:34,925 --> 00:36:37,906
[SPEAKER_05]: There's not a seam of the road and it's smooth.

488
00:36:38,627 --> 00:36:40,968
[SPEAKER_05]: Shame on us for not holding the other source.

489
00:36:41,248 --> 00:36:48,270
[SPEAKER_05]: Ian McCord, whoever McCord hired to do this, to hold it up to a better standard.

490
00:36:48,791 --> 00:36:50,291
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've heard from many residents about this.

491
00:36:50,311 --> 00:36:51,211
[SPEAKER_05]: This isn't my opinion.

492
00:36:51,231 --> 00:36:52,812
[SPEAKER_05]: It's other people's opinions too.

493
00:36:53,212 --> 00:36:57,714
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've talked to people that pave to look at it and they've given me the same thing.

494
00:36:58,487 --> 00:37:00,148
[SPEAKER_05]: It's substandard work by McCourt.

495
00:37:02,109 --> 00:37:03,270
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Carvajal.

496
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:06,511
[SPEAKER_08]: And I do just want to know I Commissioner given I don't believe is on the call.

497
00:37:06,591 --> 00:37:08,172
[SPEAKER_08]: I do know that he did reach out to you.

498
00:37:09,073 --> 00:37:09,673
[SPEAKER_08]: That was noted to me.

499
00:37:09,713 --> 00:37:12,194
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just want to note that going to Councilor Scarpelli.

500
00:37:13,535 --> 00:37:15,356
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam President, Councilor Carvajal.

501
00:37:15,376 --> 00:37:18,918
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much because I had to set some phone calls.

502
00:37:19,318 --> 00:37:20,739
[SPEAKER_06]: The phone calls I got were very

503
00:37:21,803 --> 00:37:24,324
[SPEAKER_06]: very evident when I went out and witnessed it myself.

504
00:37:24,944 --> 00:37:33,208
[SPEAKER_06]: One thing the neighbors in that area wanted me to focus on were the sore covers and how they are already dipping.

505
00:37:34,088 --> 00:37:37,931
[SPEAKER_06]: um, in those areas around every store covered either in the middle of the street of the side.

506
00:37:37,991 --> 00:37:41,414
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, and councilor councilor Cabrillo is correct.

507
00:37:41,834 --> 00:37:51,781
[SPEAKER_06]: I took that ride specifically because I brought this issue up and how they treat a method in comparison to Winchester, where they left the roads impeccable.

508
00:37:51,821 --> 00:37:56,585
[SPEAKER_06]: When they left every evening, they moved all the apparatus into the, uh, T parking lot.

509
00:37:56,605 --> 00:37:59,067
[SPEAKER_06]: There was nothing on the streets and.

510
00:38:00,135 --> 00:38:02,616
[SPEAKER_06]: And like Councilor Carvillo said, took that ride.

511
00:38:03,057 --> 00:38:15,204
[SPEAKER_06]: As soon as you entered into Winchester, you don't see seams, you don't see the manholes that are below level that are already causing a divot.

512
00:38:15,264 --> 00:38:19,906
[SPEAKER_06]: So I appreciate you bringing this forward and I'd like to know what

513
00:38:21,642 --> 00:38:28,225
[SPEAKER_06]: what the DPW director shared with Councilor Carviello because I had questions for him.

514
00:38:28,265 --> 00:38:33,408
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad he called Ricky, but this is an important issue.

515
00:38:33,448 --> 00:38:40,472
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that, you know, we've already talked at city engineers already talked about, you know, people that are pulling permits and going curb to curb on

516
00:38:41,092 --> 00:38:43,634
[SPEAKER_06]: on residential questions.

517
00:38:43,674 --> 00:39:01,187
[SPEAKER_06]: So now, if we're gonna hold residential pavers accountable, where do we stand right now with, you know, the big three, you know, Eversource, National Grid, and our city paving.

518
00:39:01,227 --> 00:39:03,048
[SPEAKER_06]: So, thank you.

519
00:39:04,769 --> 00:39:05,750
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

520
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:08,131
[SPEAKER_08]: Any further discussion from the council on this?

521
00:39:08,352 --> 00:39:08,892
[SPEAKER_05]: Madam President?

522
00:39:09,633 --> 00:39:10,133
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Carvillo.

523
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:18,076
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I thought in this project we were supposed to have somebody paid for by Eversource that was supposed to be overseeing this project.

524
00:39:19,336 --> 00:39:20,657
[SPEAKER_05]: Am I not correct in saying that?

525
00:39:22,279 --> 00:39:23,079
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe so.

526
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:26,322
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, where is the, where is the person who was supposed to be overseeing this?

527
00:39:27,883 --> 00:39:29,764
[SPEAKER_05]: That was paid for by Eversource.

528
00:39:30,285 --> 00:39:31,686
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that they just non-existence?

529
00:39:32,166 --> 00:39:34,288
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, madam president, if I can point of information.

530
00:39:35,109 --> 00:39:35,729
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scarpelli.

531
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:43,474
[SPEAKER_06]: I suggest we contact the contact people that came out for us in the summer and ask for their presence at our next meeting for next Tuesday.

532
00:39:44,094 --> 00:39:44,415
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

533
00:39:44,675 --> 00:39:46,316
[SPEAKER_06]: I make that as a form of motion if we can.

534
00:39:47,196 --> 00:39:47,556
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

535
00:39:47,597 --> 00:39:48,397
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

536
00:39:48,797 --> 00:39:49,298
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll second that.

537
00:39:49,338 --> 00:39:53,580
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so any further discussion from the council?

538
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,081
[SPEAKER_17]: Madam President.

539
00:39:55,861 --> 00:39:56,542
[SPEAKER_08]: Vice Mayor Behrs.

540
00:39:57,422 --> 00:39:58,903
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I would just add to that.

541
00:39:58,943 --> 00:39:59,424
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe we could,

542
00:40:00,408 --> 00:40:01,708
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Scott probably is amenable.

543
00:40:02,248 --> 00:40:11,150
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm in the motion to table this paper for one week and invite representatives of ever source, and the DPW to attend our next meeting.

544
00:40:12,271 --> 00:40:16,612
[SPEAKER_06]: I would have to see to that that'd be great.

545
00:40:18,092 --> 00:40:18,412
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks.

546
00:40:19,492 --> 00:40:21,373
[SPEAKER_05]: And the city engineer.

547
00:40:22,413 --> 00:40:22,593
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

548
00:40:26,455 --> 00:40:39,258
[SPEAKER_08]: So on the motion of councilor Scarpelli as amended by vice president bears to table this paper for one week, invite the representatives from Eversource as well as the city engineer to provide us an update on this work.

549
00:40:39,858 --> 00:40:41,178
[SPEAKER_08]: Seconded by councilor Carviello.

550
00:40:42,679 --> 00:40:43,799

[SPEAKER_08]: The motion passes.

566
00:41:07,935 --> 00:41:11,258
[SPEAKER_08]: 22-579 offered by Councilor Carvalho.

567
00:41:11,458 --> 00:41:14,920
[SPEAKER_08]: Be it so resolved that the heating issues at the Medford Senior Center be addressed.

568
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:18,002
[SPEAKER_08]: Please ask a representative from the building department to attend.

569
00:41:18,082 --> 00:41:18,903
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Carvalho.

570
00:41:19,723 --> 00:41:20,564
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Madam President.

571
00:41:20,584 --> 00:41:25,187
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, Madam President, I've been over to the senior center in the past couple of months

572
00:41:25,932 --> 00:41:30,436
[SPEAKER_05]: and they're walking around with space heaters there to keep the place warm.

573
00:41:30,817 --> 00:41:47,833
[SPEAKER_05]: I did get a response from the new commissioner, but it says that stuff is still not available, they're still waiting for parts, and they're going to wait for another estimate from another company.

574
00:41:48,438 --> 00:41:52,421
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, that we're in the next two days is going to be December.

575
00:41:52,941 --> 00:41:53,762
[SPEAKER_05]: And I say, well, why?

576
00:41:53,822 --> 00:41:59,886
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you say people are walking around with space heaters, they're not, it's not fair to those people, uh, that they get it.

577
00:41:59,926 --> 00:42:00,867
[SPEAKER_05]: They have to be doing that.

578
00:42:01,347 --> 00:42:05,930
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um, is, I don't know if anybody from the building department is here tonight to speak on this.

579
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:10,273
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, I don't, uh, unless you see someone, I don't see anybody better presidents.

[SPEAKER_08]: I do have the email that was sent to the council today or earlier this week, stating that they did find a temporary solution out beyond the space years.

582
00:42:24,285 --> 00:42:27,507
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm happy to share that with anyone who'd like to see it.

583
00:42:27,607 --> 00:42:32,969
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just trying to pull it up now, but I do not see anyone from the building department.

584
00:42:32,989 --> 00:42:37,751
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we're also just being in competition with that ZBA meeting that's going on concurrently.

586
00:42:42,163 --> 00:42:46,946
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, well, again, I say this isn't something that just happened last week.

587
00:42:46,966 --> 00:42:50,988
[SPEAKER_05]: This has been going on for a while and it should have been addressed some time ago.

588

[SPEAKER_05]: And I did receive a response from Marianne on this too.

609
00:43:56,888 --> 00:44:13,275
[SPEAKER_05]: And just something, you know, I had seen what other cities were doing and I just wanted to make sure that we're using the most up-to-date technology for pest control because as I think we're all getting the same calls about rats throughout the community.

610
00:44:13,315 --> 00:44:20,218
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just wanna make sure that everyone is, the city is up to date and we're using the best possible methods to keep the rodents out.

613
00:44:38,151 --> 00:44:40,932

[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for co-sponsoring this resolution with me.

634
00:45:54,786 --> 00:46:05,056
[SPEAKER_17]: Essentially, this is just that we should set a fee schedule for plan development district proposals, as outlined in the new zoning ordinance that we passed earlier this year.

635
00:46:06,878 --> 00:46:08,840
[SPEAKER_17]: In our packets there was an attachment.

636
00:46:11,239 --> 00:46:20,865
[SPEAKER_17]: Victor Schrader our economic development director who's done some review of some similar fee structures in neighboring communities.

637
00:46:20,885 --> 00:46:28,469
[SPEAKER_17]: I would motion that we refer this to committee of the whole so we can have a more in depth discussion with the relevant city staff.

638
00:46:31,773 --> 00:46:32,734
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Vice President Behrs.

[SPEAKER_08]: And I do just want to add that I am working on scheduling for middle of December, a meeting to go over some outstanding questions from the new building commissioner around the zoning recodification.

641
00:46:49,583 --> 00:46:51,704
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think this is something that we could add to that meeting.

642
00:46:51,784 --> 00:46:53,065
[SPEAKER_08]: So I will work to schedule that.

643
00:46:54,026 --> 00:46:57,928

697
00:48:31,702 --> 00:48:32,683
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Knight, go ahead.

698
00:48:32,763 --> 00:48:38,649
[SPEAKER_13]: Madam President, the only reason that I brought the motion forward was because I noticed that we had an inordinate number of people on the call.

699
00:48:39,169 --> 00:48:45,996
[SPEAKER_13]: And after looking at what was left on the agenda, I don't think that they were too concerned about fiber optics funding from our APA program.

700
00:48:46,036 --> 00:48:53,243
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's why I just wanted to make sure that in the interest of time, that these people have taken time away from their family to be here, that they had the opportunity to be heard.

701
00:48:54,495 --> 00:48:55,315
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

702
00:48:55,355 --> 00:48:57,116
[SPEAKER_08]: Apologies to any fiber optic fans.

703
00:48:57,256 --> 00:48:58,257
[SPEAKER_08]: We will get to you soon.

704
00:48:59,357 --> 00:49:03,219
[SPEAKER_08]: Going to Nicole Branley, name and address for the record, please, and I will unmute you.

705
00:49:10,963 --> 00:49:11,443
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening.

706
00:49:11,463 --> 00:49:13,084
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Nicole Branley.

707
00:49:13,624 --> 00:49:23,469
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to omit my address to share that for you privately if needed.

708
00:49:24,450 --> 00:49:24,970
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

709
00:49:25,611 --> 00:49:27,412
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to thank you all for joining tonight.

710
00:49:27,612 --> 00:49:31,015
[SPEAKER_03]: And if anybody else is upset about fiber optics, I apologize.

711
00:49:33,277 --> 00:49:39,221
[SPEAKER_03]: So good evening, first of all, to everybody.

712
00:49:39,241 --> 00:49:40,502
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much for this time.

713
00:49:40,662 --> 00:49:44,405
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm here to speak tonight regarding an incident that happened at Medford High School with my daughter.

714
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:51,490
[SPEAKER_03]: In June, my daughter began to be harassed, bullied, and threatened by a female student.

715
00:49:52,704 --> 00:49:56,225
[SPEAKER_03]: come September, the bully's sister also became an aggressor.

716
00:49:57,325 --> 00:50:02,546
[SPEAKER_03]: After multiple school incident reports, the behavior became so disturbing that a police report needed to be written.

717
00:50:02,566 --> 00:50:08,887
[SPEAKER_06]: These students- Madam President, if I can, Nicole, I hate to, we're having trouble hearing you.

718
00:50:08,927 --> 00:50:10,768
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there any way we can raise the volume?

719
00:50:11,388 --> 00:50:12,888
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you're a little soft.

720
00:50:13,728 --> 00:50:17,549
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I'm pretty much the loudest person I know, so- I know that.

721
00:50:17,889 --> 00:50:20,530
[SPEAKER_06]: I know it's an important message, so I don't want anybody to miss it.

722
00:50:20,670 --> 00:50:21,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you hear me better now?

723
00:50:23,732 --> 00:50:23,992
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

724
00:50:24,032 --> 00:50:25,893
[SPEAKER_03]: Please continue, yeah.

725
00:50:26,153 --> 00:50:39,818
[SPEAKER_03]: So on October 17th at Medford High School, our daughter was, our daughter was beaten so badly that she suffered a concussion among other injuries.

726
00:50:41,139 --> 00:50:44,600
[SPEAKER_03]: She underwent seven hours of observation at the hospital and tests.

727
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:49,482
[SPEAKER_03]: We have since needed to obtain a harassment prevention order.

728
00:50:50,467 --> 00:50:54,530
[SPEAKER_03]: We've pressed charges of assault and battery on both of my daughter's attackers.

729
00:50:57,012 --> 00:51:07,819
[SPEAKER_03]: On Tuesday night at Fenway Park, where we had hoped to enjoy a fun family night with our beloved community, the attackers violated the harassment prevention order.

730
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:13,763
[SPEAKER_03]: It took six Boston police officers to hold these students back from our daughter.

731
00:51:15,968 --> 00:51:23,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Six police officers and their parents had to hold these two teenage sisters back so they wouldn't hurt our daughter.

732
00:51:26,690 --> 00:51:31,451
[SPEAKER_03]: Who will be able to hold these students back if they return to Medford High School?

733
00:51:33,232 --> 00:51:33,592
[SPEAKER_03]: No one.

734
00:51:34,852 --> 00:51:39,833
[SPEAKER_03]: And no one will be safe, not one teacher, not one student, and certainly not our daughter.

735
00:51:41,136 --> 00:51:45,699
[SPEAKER_03]: to say this has been a nightmare of epic proportions for our family.

736
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:51,063
[SPEAKER_03]: I come here tonight to ask each and every one of you for your help.

737
00:51:55,527 --> 00:52:01,971
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a mom who can leave no stone unturned in protecting my child.

738
00:52:04,673 --> 00:52:06,575
[SPEAKER_03]: Being here tonight, I can now say

739
00:52:10,477 --> 00:52:14,500
[SPEAKER_03]: Every elected official in this city has heard our story from me.

740
00:52:15,741 --> 00:52:17,662
[SPEAKER_03]: I've spoken publicly at the school committee meeting.

741
00:52:18,883 --> 00:52:19,924
[SPEAKER_03]: I've spoken to our mayor.

742
00:52:20,284 --> 00:52:22,326
[SPEAKER_03]: I've communicated with our state representatives.

743
00:52:23,947 --> 00:52:27,750
[SPEAKER_03]: I've communicated to the news, to DCF, to DESE.

744
00:52:27,770 --> 00:52:33,534
[SPEAKER_03]: I have had our story shared hundreds of times on social media.

745
00:52:34,535 --> 00:52:38,498
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have spent countless hours trying to communicate with Mefford High School.

746
00:52:42,477 --> 00:52:51,664
[SPEAKER_03]: What happened to our daughter opened my eyes to a much larger problem at Mefford High School, one of rules not being followed, and I'm seeing that starting with our administration.

747
00:52:54,046 --> 00:53:02,853
[SPEAKER_03]: Multiple times, my daughter's attackers were wandering the halls, searching her out to threaten her life in a class that she belonged to, not them.

748
00:53:05,787 --> 00:53:09,708
[SPEAKER_03]: Not one school administrator called us when this all began.

749
00:53:10,329 --> 00:53:13,330
[SPEAKER_03]: Incident reports were written, and I never got a phone call.

750
00:53:13,630 --> 00:53:14,810
[SPEAKER_03]: I never got an email.

751
00:53:18,091 --> 00:53:29,775
[SPEAKER_03]: At one point, I had to go to the school where I came to learn the administration was unable to locate these bullies who had tried to enter yet another one of my daughter's classes.

752
00:53:31,596 --> 00:53:34,497
[SPEAKER_03]: They could not find these girls on the Meffitt High School campus.

753
00:53:35,595 --> 00:53:40,118
[SPEAKER_03]: And they asked me to dismiss my daughter for her safety.

754
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:49,184
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder all the time what would happen if she wasn't as communicative to me.

755
00:53:49,364 --> 00:53:51,105
[SPEAKER_03]: What if she didn't text me during those times?

756
00:53:51,186 --> 00:53:51,966
[SPEAKER_03]: What would have happened?

757
00:53:54,448 --> 00:54:02,253
[SPEAKER_03]: I've learned from many sources that cutting classes and hiding in bathrooms is a regular occurrence at Medford High for students.

758
00:54:03,216 --> 00:54:07,579
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not always followed up by our administration for consequences.

759
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:19,487
[SPEAKER_03]: No doubt they are overwhelmed, but I refuse to make excuses for the adults who have a job to do to ensure all of our children's safety.

760
00:54:21,228 --> 00:54:28,113
[SPEAKER_03]: We all own a part in this, each of you, our city officials, school staff, and parents.

761
00:54:28,653 --> 00:54:32,676
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to show our students that there are consequences for their actions.

762
00:54:35,539 --> 00:54:41,281
[SPEAKER_03]: There's nothing more I want than to work with the superintendent and her administration to ensure our daughter's safety.

763
00:54:42,381 --> 00:54:48,463
[SPEAKER_03]: Although we have had some communication in one meeting, unfortunately, I have had multiple emails not returned.

764
00:54:49,803 --> 00:54:56,105
[SPEAKER_03]: I requested paperwork that had a 10-day deadline, not by me, but by law, and it was not received.

765
00:54:57,665 --> 00:55:04,887
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been given dates by Medford High School admin of when the paperwork would be ready, and yet these dates have also passed.

766
00:55:06,447 --> 00:55:10,709
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been told one of my daughter's attackers was removed from a class when she was not.

767
00:55:11,710 --> 00:55:17,753
[SPEAKER_03]: I have been told that they were suspended indefinitely at one point.

768
00:55:17,773 --> 00:55:18,613
[SPEAKER_03]: They were not.

769
00:55:20,394 --> 00:55:21,995
[SPEAKER_03]: I was assured they never crossed paths.

770
00:55:22,395 --> 00:55:22,775
[SPEAKER_03]: They did.

771
00:55:22,795 --> 00:55:29,159
[SPEAKER_03]: I was assured they never entered CAF II, which is exactly where they entered the day that they attacked my daughter.

772
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:35,702
[SPEAKER_03]: No school administration even thought to reach out to the other family.

773
00:55:36,767 --> 00:55:40,468
[SPEAKER_03]: knowing that their child was on the football team on Tuesday night.

774
00:55:40,488 --> 00:55:46,109
[SPEAKER_03]: And there, yet again, they tried to attack my daughter.

775
00:55:47,709 --> 00:55:48,409
[SPEAKER_03]: It's negligent.

776
00:55:50,730 --> 00:55:59,052
[SPEAKER_03]: Disregarding the rules is starting at the top of our school chain, so no wonder some students are not following the rules.

777
00:56:00,052 --> 00:56:03,272
[SPEAKER_03]: School administration must be the leader.

778
00:56:04,753 --> 00:56:06,093
[SPEAKER_03]: They must set a better example.

779
00:56:07,585 --> 00:56:13,068
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope the example that I'm setting for my daughter is a good one, to always stand up for what is right.

780
00:56:14,169 --> 00:56:16,010
[SPEAKER_03]: And I also hope you will stand with me.

781
00:56:17,110 --> 00:56:21,313
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm willing to help in any way, any solution that I can.

782
00:56:21,333 --> 00:56:24,935
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm open to every suggestion on how to help.

783
00:56:26,636 --> 00:56:32,399
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanna work with our city officials, the school, our teachers, they are so talented.

784
00:56:33,117 --> 00:56:37,720
[SPEAKER_03]: They are beloved, and they deserve to have every child be able to thrive in front of them.

785
00:56:38,961 --> 00:56:42,404
[SPEAKER_03]: What is allowed in our schools sets the standard in our community.

786
00:56:43,625 --> 00:56:45,446
[SPEAKER_03]: And I appreciate you listening to me.

787
00:56:46,146 --> 00:56:47,227
[SPEAKER_03]: I thank you for your time.

788
00:56:48,688 --> 00:56:52,871
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would appreciate any solutions that you may have for me going forward.

789
00:56:53,351 --> 00:56:53,752
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

790
00:56:55,873 --> 00:56:56,273
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Ms.

791
00:56:56,294 --> 00:56:56,614
[SPEAKER_08]: Brantley.

792
00:56:58,855 --> 00:57:02,558
[SPEAKER_08]: Any discussion, comments from the council at this point?

793
00:57:05,392 --> 00:57:07,913
[SPEAKER_08]: Go to Councilor Carviello and then Councilor Scarpelli.

794
00:57:08,813 --> 00:57:09,573
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Madam President.

795
00:57:09,673 --> 00:57:18,276
[SPEAKER_05]: And thank you, Nicole, for coming forward and having the courage to stand up here and say what you said to all these people.

796
00:57:19,337 --> 00:57:26,179
[SPEAKER_05]: And like I said, you know, I have a granddaughter that goes there and same age as, I think, as your daughter.

797
00:57:26,799 --> 00:57:29,680
[SPEAKER_05]: And she tells me stories of things that happened there.

798
00:57:30,580 --> 00:57:33,681
[SPEAKER_05]: And I say, I don't know what to tell you.

799
00:57:33,761 --> 00:57:35,162
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish I had some advice for you.

800
00:57:36,185 --> 00:57:43,751
[SPEAKER_05]: I've reached out to you with any help I can be to you, but I say that this is not how children should have to go to school in the city of Medford.

801
00:57:45,673 --> 00:57:47,194
[SPEAKER_05]: Kids shouldn't be afraid.

802
00:57:47,434 --> 00:57:49,076
[SPEAKER_05]: They shouldn't be hiding in bathrooms.

803
00:57:49,776 --> 00:57:54,540
[SPEAKER_05]: They should be there to learn, not learn how to fight, but learn learning basic things.

804
00:57:55,301 --> 00:58:01,466
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, I say, I commend you for your courage and the battle that you're waging.

805
00:58:03,327 --> 00:58:12,034
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope that the school department at some point stands up and does the right thing for your daughter, instead of standing up for the people that they shouldn't be standing up for.

806
00:58:12,515 --> 00:58:17,259
[SPEAKER_05]: We shouldn't be standing up for the people that are the attackers.

807
00:58:18,180 --> 00:58:21,222
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, I thank you for your courage in standing up here tonight.

808
00:58:23,924 --> 00:58:24,885
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Carvell.

809
00:58:24,905 --> 00:58:25,606
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Scarpelli.

810
00:58:28,028 --> 00:58:28,969
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam President.

811
00:58:29,509 --> 00:58:31,071
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, thank you, Mr. Brownlee.

812
00:58:32,207 --> 00:58:34,028
[SPEAKER_06]: It takes a lot of courage to do what you're doing.

813
00:58:35,108 --> 00:58:39,250
[SPEAKER_06]: It's easy just to keep your mouth shut and walk away and hope things are going to be okay.

814
00:58:39,310 --> 00:58:42,011
[SPEAKER_06]: But I know I've talked to you personally.

815
00:58:43,292 --> 00:58:47,494
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we all share situations about children being bullied, mine as well.

816
00:58:48,134 --> 00:58:50,535
[SPEAKER_06]: As a city councilor, we have a school committee.

817
00:58:50,952 --> 00:58:58,796
[SPEAKER_06]: and the mayor who's the president of that committee that are in charge of making sure that they follow through these issues.

818
00:58:59,036 --> 00:59:02,938
[SPEAKER_06]: So as a city councilor, it's very difficult to cross over.

819
00:59:03,919 --> 00:59:05,220
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'll leave that with that.

820
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:12,203
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that you had some, without getting that information, you had some interest to talk to the city solicitor.

821
00:59:12,223 --> 00:59:13,164
[SPEAKER_06]: I know we talked about that.

822
00:59:13,224 --> 00:59:18,207
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, I informed you that we don't have a city solicitor because you were asking who you can speak to.

823
00:59:18,987 --> 00:59:20,688
[SPEAKER_06]: So that I apologize for on our end,

824
00:59:21,253 --> 00:59:31,203
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm going to speak right now as a parent of a Medford High School student, someone that has had their kids go through the system from preschool all the way through high school.

825
00:59:32,244 --> 00:59:39,832
[SPEAKER_06]: As a member of a teacher in the system and a member of the school committee that did everything in my power to make sure that

826
00:59:40,692 --> 00:59:59,478
[SPEAKER_06]: We put in strongholds to make sure that our kids are protected, putting in bullying protection programs, setting up mentoring programs, making sure the kids that don't want to be in the school and that are harming our children every single day, that they're the ones that are being looked at and those are the ones that are being taken to task.

827
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:11,309
[SPEAKER_06]: And unfortunately, what we hear over and over again, especially with this story with the Bramley family, it seems like that's not the priority right now.

828
01:00:12,290 --> 01:00:15,033
[SPEAKER_06]: I told you in a meeting months ago when this happened,

829
01:00:15,930 --> 01:00:33,868
[SPEAKER_06]: We're still seeing the uh, the the children that that that can't go to the bathroom because the the bad kids or the kids that don't care are using those bathrooms and And going kids not eating in cafeterias And finding little nooks and crannies to eat throughout the building.

830
01:00:34,128 --> 01:00:38,973
[SPEAKER_06]: That's despicable That's horrifying to me and why

831
01:00:40,308 --> 01:00:41,949
[SPEAKER_06]: and why the kids are telling me.

832
01:00:41,969 --> 01:00:47,474
[SPEAKER_06]: They're telling me that the administration's in the buildings afraid to punish kids because of rules that are put into place.

833
01:00:48,735 --> 01:01:02,987
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I think we need to revisit these rules and make sure that we hold a school committee and our mayor and the school administration, the superintendent, to task, that this is their job.

834
01:01:03,427 --> 01:01:05,809
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm not talking as a city councilor, because I'm out of line if I was.

835
01:01:06,069 --> 01:01:08,932
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm talking as a parent of a senior at Medford High School.

836
01:01:10,153 --> 01:01:17,378
[SPEAKER_06]: And when I hear ridiculous comments like, geez, maybe this child should go to a private school.

837
01:01:17,418 --> 01:01:19,319
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe she should just leave.

838
01:01:19,399 --> 01:01:20,060
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you kidding me?

839
01:01:21,481 --> 01:01:22,742
[SPEAKER_06]: The Brantleys did nothing wrong.

840
01:01:23,122 --> 01:01:24,903
[SPEAKER_06]: The kids that are bullied do nothing wrong.

841
01:01:26,064 --> 01:01:31,228
[SPEAKER_06]: We should take a stance against the kids that don't want to be there, that are harmful to our kids.

842
01:01:32,186 --> 01:01:33,367
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to take a stand.

843
01:01:33,727 --> 01:01:38,689
[SPEAKER_06]: So as a parent, I'll do everything I can to make sure that my voice is heard as well, Nicole.

844
01:01:39,189 --> 01:01:41,330
[SPEAKER_06]: This is horrific.

845
01:01:42,330 --> 01:01:44,571
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw the video, it's disgusting.

846
01:01:46,272 --> 01:01:47,092
[SPEAKER_06]: That is the parent.

847
01:01:47,152 --> 01:01:49,653
[SPEAKER_06]: As a city council, I will tell you, we have no grounds.

848
01:01:49,753 --> 01:02:00,198
[SPEAKER_06]: We truly have no grounds that this is, you know, unless when it comes to the budget meeting, we talked to the superintendent, because it seems like that's the only time we seem to get any information.

849
01:02:00,967 --> 01:02:08,057
[SPEAKER_06]: Because unfortunately, we found out as a council through the newspaper, through the TVs.

850
01:02:09,359 --> 01:02:13,405
[SPEAKER_06]: I wasn't notified, and I'm sure most of my fellow councils weren't notified.

851
01:02:15,497 --> 01:02:17,738
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's very difficult when we don't get information.

852
01:02:17,798 --> 01:02:19,298
[SPEAKER_06]: We have to hear from newspapers and stuff.

853
01:02:19,598 --> 01:02:21,159
[SPEAKER_06]: That's frustrating in itself.

854
01:02:21,179 --> 01:02:24,080
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's what I'm frustrated as a city councilor.

855
01:02:24,540 --> 01:02:28,341
[SPEAKER_06]: As a parent of a child at Medford High School, I'm appalled that this is still going on.

856
01:02:28,901 --> 01:02:31,782
[SPEAKER_06]: My daughter was there and watched the situation occur right in front of her.

857
01:02:32,022 --> 01:02:33,562
[SPEAKER_06]: And she was horrified for this family.

858
01:02:34,463 --> 01:02:35,023
[SPEAKER_06]: Horrified.

859
01:02:36,162 --> 01:02:37,363
[SPEAKER_06]: And so were all their classmates.

860
01:02:37,383 --> 01:02:38,464
[SPEAKER_06]: But you know what they're told to do?

861
01:02:39,044 --> 01:02:44,548
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep their mouth shut, sit on their hands, because they're afraid that they're the next people to be bullied.

862
01:02:44,568 --> 01:02:45,569
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's not the way to live.

863
01:02:46,950 --> 01:02:51,553
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember one person stood up and looked me right in the eye and said, say something, see something, say something.

864
01:02:52,314 --> 01:02:55,376
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we're seeing plenty, and we're doing nothing.

865
01:02:56,797 --> 01:03:04,703
[SPEAKER_06]: So please, if there's anything that the school committee that's on tonight or the city administration that's going to hear this, please,

866
01:03:06,174 --> 01:03:11,779
[SPEAKER_06]: work with the school administration, work with those great teachers, because that's the other thing.

867
01:03:11,819 --> 01:03:15,363
[SPEAKER_06]: We went out and got us... We heard that there was a study done.

868
01:03:17,084 --> 01:03:30,196
[SPEAKER_06]: That's great that we did a study, but we wasted money, the city's money, on bringing someone in from the outside when we could have just asked the teachers, great teachers that know exactly what's going on and what we need to fix.

869
01:03:30,857 --> 01:03:31,758
[SPEAKER_06]: No one's asked them that.

870
01:03:34,182 --> 01:03:43,459
[SPEAKER_06]: Instead, I'm getting phone calls from teachers that they're afraid to stand up because they're wiping blood off their clothes, off their bodies, because they just broke up another fight.

871
01:03:45,347 --> 01:03:59,956
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Nicole, again, I don't want to revert and take this away from your points that you made, but I tell you, as a parent, I'm standing with you, and I'll do whatever needs to be done as a parent to make sure that your child is safe.

872
01:04:00,016 --> 01:04:07,340
[SPEAKER_06]: There's absolutely no reason why your daughter has to fear and put her head down at night knowing that she has to get up in the morning to go to Medford High School.

873
01:04:08,937 --> 01:04:17,906
[SPEAKER_06]: In no way in the world should you and your family think of trying to figure out how you can break the bank to try to figure out to move your daughter to a different school system just because this is happening.

874
01:04:19,267 --> 01:04:19,927
[SPEAKER_06]: I condemn that.

875
01:04:20,740 --> 01:04:22,742
[SPEAKER_06]: So I thank you, Madam President.

876
01:04:23,303 --> 01:04:32,413
[SPEAKER_06]: And if what we can do is we can ask the city administration, I will tell you, Nicole, I do not support AP law.

877
01:04:32,634 --> 01:04:35,237
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't know what we're paying for this community and paying them.

878
01:04:35,477 --> 01:04:38,220
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know what it would be a charge to this community.

879
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:39,762
[SPEAKER_06]: But right now, I'm at the point where

880
01:04:40,772 --> 01:04:43,296
[SPEAKER_06]: No charge right now would be too small, too large.

881
01:04:43,837 --> 01:04:45,419
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to get assistance for this family.

882
01:04:45,439 --> 01:04:51,628
[SPEAKER_06]: If she's not getting the information she needs by law of the timetable, then someone needs to assist her.

883
01:04:51,989 --> 01:04:53,832
[SPEAKER_06]: And obviously when I talk to Nicole,

884
01:04:54,715 --> 01:04:59,558
[SPEAKER_06]: She wanted to come here to see if anybody and I explained to her that we don't have a city solicitor No one really can answer you.

885
01:05:00,078 --> 01:05:13,045
[SPEAKER_06]: So I know this is going to get back to the superintendent I know that there's commitments on this on this call, please Somebody get mrs. Brantley the information that she needs so sure and her daughter and her family could rest every day, please.

886
01:05:13,265 --> 01:05:15,567
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you Thank you.

887
01:05:15,587 --> 01:05:19,009
[SPEAKER_08]: Councillor scarpelli councillor night, um, madam president.

888
01:05:19,069 --> 01:05:19,849
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you very much.

889
01:05:20,530 --> 01:05:22,371
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, first of all, um

890
01:05:23,987 --> 01:05:31,529
[SPEAKER_13]: I've known Nicole and Rob for quite a bit of time now, and I'm very proud to call them my friends.

891
01:05:31,829 --> 01:05:40,992
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm very proud of Nicole for taking the action that she's taken and standing up and fighting for her family and not letting this get pushed under the rug.

892
01:05:41,712 --> 01:05:42,052
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

893
01:05:42,812 --> 01:05:51,435
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, it takes a lot for someone who's been so invested in this community for so many years to get up and to do what she's doing.

894
01:05:52,535 --> 01:06:00,276
[SPEAKER_13]: And I know that the last thing that she wants to be in the last thing she wants her family to be is the center of attention surrounded by such negative energy.

895
01:06:01,217 --> 01:06:03,617
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, so, you know, Nicole, thank you.

896
01:06:04,497 --> 01:06:10,078
[SPEAKER_13]: And through you to, to Rob and your daughter, um, for putting up the fight.

897
01:06:10,898 --> 01:06:21,420
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, because if you weren't going to talk about it, it was going to go away and you're not letting it go away and you shouldn't, um, ultimately, you know,

898
01:06:22,551 --> 01:06:23,872
[SPEAKER_13]: There's been a systemic failure.

899
01:06:24,833 --> 01:06:28,956
[SPEAKER_13]: The systems failed you and it's not right.

900
01:06:30,097 --> 01:06:31,659
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's not an isolated incident.

901
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:33,380
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

902
01:06:33,420 --> 01:06:34,741
[SPEAKER_13]: We hear the stories every day.

903
01:06:35,582 --> 01:06:51,175
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, the same mayor that chases down room is putting GPS trackers on, on city employees cars is the same mayor that's trying to control the narrative on this, but this administration should be doing is reaching out to this family.

904
01:06:51,565 --> 01:06:57,668
[SPEAKER_13]: to see what they can do to protect the family, not reaching out to the newspapers to see how they can control a narrative.

905
01:06:58,348 --> 01:06:59,188
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's shameful.

906
01:06:59,989 --> 01:07:01,329
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's absolutely shameful.

907
01:07:02,490 --> 01:07:20,878
[SPEAKER_13]: When I sit back and I think to just a few years ago, when I mentioned it previously, we had a city councilor standing in the auditorium at Memphis high school, screaming and yelling like a lunatic at the superintendent over a gun magazine that was found in a little theater after a private rental.

908
01:07:22,356 --> 01:07:29,578
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm still waiting for that former city councilor who's now a mayor to have this conversation with her superintendent.

909
01:07:31,839 --> 01:07:32,799
[SPEAKER_13]: Cause I don't think it's happened.

910
01:07:33,359 --> 01:07:34,020
[SPEAKER_13]: I haven't seen it.

911
01:07:35,740 --> 01:07:37,121
[SPEAKER_13]: There are safety issues in our schools.

912
01:07:37,961 --> 01:07:38,921
[SPEAKER_13]: There's no question about it.

913
01:07:39,141 --> 01:07:40,462
[SPEAKER_13]: This is not an isolated incident.

914
01:07:42,242 --> 01:07:51,605
[SPEAKER_13]: What happened to Nicole's daughter wasn't just kids being kids that got into a disagreement that ended up in a fistfight.

915
01:07:52,377 --> 01:07:55,918
[SPEAKER_13]: It was a criminal attack, an organized criminal attack.

916
01:07:58,360 --> 01:07:59,760
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's, it's, it's sickening.

917
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:00,260
[SPEAKER_13]: It's sad.

918
01:08:00,981 --> 01:08:12,886
[SPEAKER_13]: It's sad to see that this woman can't get answers, that she can't send her daughter to school to receive an education and have the peace of mind that her child's going to be safe.

919
01:08:14,906 --> 01:08:17,568
[SPEAKER_13]: Imagine sending your kid off every day, a nervous wreck.

920
01:08:17,948 --> 01:08:20,729
[SPEAKER_13]: It's bad enough out there in the world, not having to worry about things like this.

921
01:08:21,469 --> 01:08:27,412
[SPEAKER_13]: And imagine sending your kid off to school every single day being a nervous wreck, wondering if today's going to be the day that you get another phone call.

922
01:08:31,334 --> 01:08:38,397
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, consultants, consultants, consultants, meetings, consultants.

923
01:08:39,858 --> 01:08:43,499
[SPEAKER_13]: We have a pretty well-paid administrative staff over in the school department.

924
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:47,561
[SPEAKER_13]: We have people that are making salaries over $200,000, but we need consultants.

925
01:08:56,262 --> 01:08:57,463
[SPEAKER_13]: The focus should be on the student.

926
01:08:58,363 --> 01:08:59,583
[SPEAKER_13]: The focus should be on the victim.

927
01:09:02,005 --> 01:09:04,566
[SPEAKER_13]: Quite frankly, I think Mr. Greenspan should be involved in this.

928
01:09:05,226 --> 01:09:09,068
[SPEAKER_13]: I think immediately after this occurred, Mr. Greenspan should have reached out to the family.

929
01:09:09,988 --> 01:09:11,889
[SPEAKER_13]: He is the attorney for the school department.

930
01:09:12,769 --> 01:09:15,410
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't understand why Mr. Greenspan hasn't sat down with the family yet.

931
01:09:19,032 --> 01:09:22,614
[SPEAKER_13]: The superintendent should have been over at the house, visiting the family.

932
01:09:23,154 --> 01:09:25,855
[SPEAKER_13]: They should have been at the hospital to make sure that she was okay.

933
01:09:28,851 --> 01:09:32,372
[SPEAKER_13]: Those are the things that happen in the community where our leaders are vested.

934
01:09:37,674 --> 01:09:44,556
[SPEAKER_13]: Imagine being a parent and after this happens, you pick up the phone and you call the superintendent's office and they tell you that she's on vacation.

935
01:09:46,877 --> 01:09:47,597
[SPEAKER_13]: Talk to me in a week.

936
01:09:48,398 --> 01:09:48,898
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you kidding me?

937
01:09:48,918 --> 01:09:51,599
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you kidding me?

938
01:09:52,339 --> 01:09:52,899
[SPEAKER_13]: It's craziness.

939
01:09:53,559 --> 01:09:54,380
[SPEAKER_13]: It's absolute craziness.

940
01:09:56,520 --> 01:09:58,101
[SPEAKER_13]: Nicole, I stand with you.

941
01:09:58,790 --> 01:10:03,894
[SPEAKER_13]: And I stand with the other families who have gone through this very same situation.

942
01:10:04,694 --> 01:10:08,837
[SPEAKER_13]: And quite frankly, I have kids in the public school system too, and it hasn't been a pretty ride.

943
01:10:09,998 --> 01:10:12,480
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, my third grader has quite a bit of trouble at school.

944
01:10:13,621 --> 01:10:15,522
[SPEAKER_13]: Seventh graders in the playground at the Brooks School.

945
01:10:15,983 --> 01:10:18,365
[SPEAKER_13]: The seventh graders have no business at the playground in the Brooks School.

946
01:10:18,385 --> 01:10:18,945
[SPEAKER_13]: Why are they there?

947
01:10:20,046 --> 01:10:23,088
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, what steps are we taking to make sure that our schools are safe?

948
01:10:24,329 --> 01:10:25,650
[SPEAKER_13]: And why isn't the mayor acting

949
01:10:26,361 --> 01:10:33,723
[SPEAKER_13]: with the same outrage that she acted with previously when a far less severe incident happened, when nobody got hurt.

950
01:10:34,803 --> 01:10:36,543
[SPEAKER_13]: These are the questions that I ask myself every day.

951
01:10:37,143 --> 01:10:38,124
[SPEAKER_13]: These are leadership issues.

952
01:10:39,224 --> 01:10:40,364
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll walk through the fire with you.

953
01:10:41,444 --> 01:10:41,804
[SPEAKER_13]: I will.

954
01:10:42,205 --> 01:10:43,185
[SPEAKER_13]: I think this is terrible.

955
01:10:43,905 --> 01:10:47,406
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think that there are some resources out there and there are some ideas for us to pursue.

956
01:10:48,566 --> 01:10:51,527
[SPEAKER_13]: Like George said, you shouldn't be considering out-of-district placement.

957
01:10:52,047 --> 01:10:53,247
[SPEAKER_13]: You shouldn't have to be forced

958
01:10:53,766 --> 01:10:57,448
[SPEAKER_13]: to spend money to send your daughter to another school because you're not feeling safe.

959
01:10:57,929 --> 01:10:58,949
[SPEAKER_13]: But maybe the city should do it.

960
01:10:59,109 --> 01:11:00,690
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe the city should send her to the charter school.

961
01:11:00,750 --> 01:11:01,931
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe the city should get her in there then.

962
01:11:02,992 --> 01:11:09,496
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe the city should take some affirmative steps to be sure that your tax dollars are being well spent and that your family is being protected.

963
01:11:09,976 --> 01:11:12,738
[SPEAKER_13]: The number one role in government is to make sure that our community is safe.

964
01:11:13,398 --> 01:11:14,058
[SPEAKER_13]: And we're failing it.

965
01:11:14,519 --> 01:11:16,980
[SPEAKER_13]: And we're failing our most vulnerable citizens, our students.

966
01:11:17,741 --> 01:11:18,621
[SPEAKER_13]: So for that, I'm sorry.

967
01:11:18,981 --> 01:11:21,583
[SPEAKER_13]: And I look at this as a reflection of the failure of government.

968
01:11:22,156 --> 01:11:24,919
[SPEAKER_13]: not just the administration, not just the school department of government as a whole.

969
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:29,122
[SPEAKER_13]: And as Nicole said at the beginning, very astutely, we all have a partner.

970
01:11:30,584 --> 01:11:31,304
[SPEAKER_13]: I wanna make it right.

971
01:11:34,868 --> 01:11:35,668
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

972
01:11:35,989 --> 01:11:37,430
[SPEAKER_09]: Any further discussion from the council?

973
01:11:41,458 --> 01:11:42,518
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeing none, Ms.

974
01:11:42,538 --> 01:11:43,939
[SPEAKER_08]: Braley, thank you for coming out to speak.

975
01:11:44,639 --> 01:11:47,600
[SPEAKER_08]: My heart breaks for you and your daughter and mother to mother.

976
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:50,901
[SPEAKER_08]: I understand going to the ends of the earth for your child.

977
01:11:51,082 --> 01:11:56,403
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just applaud your courage and your advocacy and just pushing forth on this.

978
01:11:57,804 --> 01:12:04,867
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm, you know, as other counselors have said, we're limited in what we can do statutorily, but I think we're all want to be part of the solution the way we can.

979
01:12:05,147 --> 01:12:06,167
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you for coming out.

980
01:12:10,526 --> 01:12:13,848
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving on, is there anyone else who would like to speak for public participation?

981
01:12:21,012 --> 01:12:22,512
[SPEAKER_09]: Please raise your hand if you'd like to speak.

982
01:12:27,035 --> 01:12:31,757
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing none at this time, do I have a motion to revert to the regular order of business?

983
01:12:40,057 --> 01:12:53,523
[SPEAKER_09]: So, on the motion of cancer saying to revert to the regular order of business, seconded by seconded.

984
01:12:54,904 --> 01:12:56,845
[SPEAKER_09]: People can hear me right.

985
01:12:56,925 --> 01:12:58,465
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Collins Mr. Clerk, please call the role.

986
01:13:01,527 --> 01:13:02,327
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice President bears.

987

[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

01:14:20,553 --> 01:14:23,715
[SPEAKER_08]: I do believe we will have, we don't have a central representative from the administration.

1008
01:14:23,755 --> 01:14:27,738
[SPEAKER_08]: We have different folks from these departments who will present on these papers.

1009
01:14:29,079 --> 01:14:30,900
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm happy to turn it over to them.

1010
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:34,723
[SPEAKER_08]: I see the chief, unless any counselors have questions before we get started.

1011
01:14:37,825 --> 01:14:39,546
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing none, passing it over to you, Chief Friedman.

1012
01:14:40,587 --> 01:14:43,149
[SPEAKER_09]: And I will unmute you.

1013
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:48,100
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, can you hear me?

1014
01:14:48,901 --> 01:14:49,121
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1015
01:14:49,661 --> 01:14:51,862
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1016
01:14:52,422 --> 01:14:53,883
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1017
01:14:57,504 --> 01:14:58,584
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, I can hear myself.

1018
01:14:58,604 --> 01:15:01,966
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if other folks can hear me if there's like that kind of bounce back.

1019
01:15:02,046 --> 01:15:03,366
[SPEAKER_10]: I can hear myself.

1020
01:15:03,386 --> 01:15:07,768
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if other folks can hear me if there's that kind of bounce back.

1021
01:15:09,028 --> 01:15:10,369
[SPEAKER_09]: I am also hearing you, President Morrell.

1022
01:15:10,389 --> 01:15:13,550
[SPEAKER_10]: I am also hearing you, President Morrell.

1023
01:15:15,571 --> 01:15:16,872
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you watching on another?

1024
01:15:17,132 --> 01:15:19,273
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have another device open to Chief Friedman?

1025
01:15:19,293 --> 01:15:20,173
[SPEAKER_08]: Or are you just on your computer?

1026
01:15:20,193 --> 01:15:21,894
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know why we're hearing like multiple times.

1027
01:15:22,875 --> 01:15:24,175
[SPEAKER_02]: I just have one device.

1028
01:15:26,336 --> 01:15:27,337
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, it seems to have stopped.

1029
01:15:27,937 --> 01:15:29,017
[SPEAKER_08]: So please proceed.

1030
01:15:29,298 --> 01:15:31,078
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, I'll just be quiet, please proceed.

1031
01:15:38,252 --> 01:15:38,812
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, okay.

1032
01:15:38,852 --> 01:15:40,853
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, hopefully everyone can hear me.

1033
01:15:40,893 --> 01:15:42,114
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the chief of the fire department.

1034
01:15:42,194 --> 01:15:44,395
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm here to speak on behalf of the two fire projects.

1035
01:15:44,915 --> 01:15:50,497
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, the first one is the fiber optic network that is going to connect, uh, all the fire stations with headquarters.

1036
01:15:51,037 --> 01:15:56,560
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, the second one is the, uh, installation of an upgraded CTRON max system.

1037
01:15:57,220 --> 01:16:06,944
[SPEAKER_02]: Which kind of goes hand in hand with the fiber optics that will allow us to, um, have more reliability and increase that, uh, so that we won't.

1038
01:16:08,344 --> 01:16:11,145
[SPEAKER_02]: um, have any failures that we've been experiencing in the past.

1039
01:16:12,086 --> 01:16:24,152
[SPEAKER_02]: So both of these projects are, um, you know, at a time where, where we hired the, um, onus project manager for headquarters.

1040
01:16:24,392 --> 01:16:29,274
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have selected an architectural firm, which allows us access to sub consultants.

1041
01:16:30,215 --> 01:16:37,178
[SPEAKER_02]: And in effect, it's like, um, you know, greater efficiency because we have them

1042
01:16:37,732 --> 01:16:39,753
[SPEAKER_02]: to assist us with this project.

1043
01:16:40,533 --> 01:16:54,116
[SPEAKER_02]: And it has the potential to give us that sort of economy of scale, if you will, where instead of having two separate projects and separate consultants, we have access to them now.

1044
01:16:54,717 --> 01:16:58,418
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a good time to look at these projects and fund them.

1045
01:16:58,918 --> 01:17:07,060
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm here to entertain any questions that the council has, if they want more detail on the projects or any questions.

1046
01:17:09,367 --> 01:17:09,967
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Chief.

1047
01:17:12,749 --> 01:17:14,570
[SPEAKER_08]: Any discussion or questions from the Council?

1048
01:17:14,610 --> 01:17:27,138
[SPEAKER_08]: I do want to note, so at our ARPA meeting we had before the Thanksgiving holiday, we did have the question whether these papers were coming before us for appropriation approval, and the Chief of Staff

1049
01:17:28,089 --> 01:17:33,252
[SPEAKER_08]: essentially said this is kind of a courtesy or something that they just like to present on.

1050
01:17:33,292 --> 01:17:44,439
[SPEAKER_08]: So just noting for that consideration of the council that this is essentially just receiving a presentation, but not something the administration has deemed that they need our appropriation approval on.

1051
01:17:48,322 --> 01:17:49,463
[SPEAKER_09]: Any questions from the council?

1052
01:17:55,527 --> 01:17:57,688
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing none, thank you so much chief, much appreciated.

1053
01:17:58,462 --> 01:17:59,302
[SPEAKER_06]: Madam President, sorry.

1054
01:17:59,542 --> 01:18:00,563
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1055
01:18:01,123 --> 01:18:03,164
[SPEAKER_06]: I just, I know I'm breaking in and out.

1056
01:18:03,184 --> 01:18:08,486
[SPEAKER_06]: So we really, this doesn't matter on what we, we don't have a vote on this.

1057
01:18:08,547 --> 01:18:09,527
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that what I just heard?

1058
01:18:09,587 --> 01:18:09,807
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it?

1059
01:18:10,848 --> 01:18:20,572
[SPEAKER_08]: That is essentially what the chief of staff told me other counselors that were there, if they could confirm that I misinterpreted that, but basically they, this is being presented to us as more of a

1060
01:18:22,210 --> 01:18:24,336
[SPEAKER_08]: deemed as a courtesy to provide us more information.

1061
01:18:24,356 --> 01:18:29,971
[SPEAKER_08]: They would like us to be on board, but they don't think that they need an appropriation vote from us.

1062
01:18:30,832 --> 01:18:31,092
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1063
01:18:31,132 --> 01:18:39,821
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I think that this is important because I know when this first came out and there were departments that were left out and chief Friedman fire or one of the departments.

1064
01:18:39,881 --> 01:18:41,883
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad to see that we're moving forward.

1065
01:18:41,903 --> 01:18:46,547
[SPEAKER_06]: This isn't something I would, I would vote against, but, uh, there are some concerns.

1066
01:18:46,628 --> 01:18:52,774
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that, um, uh, I know there's some it issues that are coming up and we don't have an it department.

1067
01:18:52,814 --> 01:18:53,734
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know what,

1068
01:18:54,375 --> 01:19:01,220
[SPEAKER_06]: what we're doing to get that into place, and then some other concerns that I have with the recommendation.

1069
01:19:01,260 --> 01:19:04,562
[SPEAKER_06]: So if I take it again, it really doesn't matter.

1070
01:19:06,023 --> 01:19:09,506
[SPEAKER_06]: But hey, thanks for the input.

1071
01:19:09,706 --> 01:19:10,546
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate that.

1072
01:19:11,027 --> 01:19:12,247
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, Madam President.

1073
01:19:12,988 --> 01:19:13,949
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1074
01:19:13,989 --> 01:19:14,629
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Collins.

1075
01:19:16,751 --> 01:19:17,691
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, President Morrell.

1076
01:19:17,711 --> 01:19:23,055
[SPEAKER_15]: Just since you asked for confirmation, I just wanted to offer mine, what I heard from the chief of staff at our

1077
01:19:23,650 --> 01:19:38,562
[SPEAKER_15]: meeting was that I say, I believe that they said they were looking for feedback, an opportunity for feedback from the city council on these projects, but that they had, the executive office has full jurisdiction to go ahead with the appropriations and that they do not need our vote to complete them.

1078
01:19:39,983 --> 01:19:40,844
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councillor Collins.

1079
01:19:41,784 --> 01:19:46,728
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, Councillor Knight, did you wanna go?

1080
01:19:47,669 --> 01:19:52,373
[SPEAKER_13]: I was just wondering if the dog and pony show was over now or if we're good to go.

1081
01:19:53,525 --> 01:19:55,926
[SPEAKER_08]: we do have a few more items of this agenda.

1082
01:19:57,166 --> 01:19:57,907
[SPEAKER_08]: Vice President Behrs.

1083
01:19:58,927 --> 01:19:59,807
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Madam President.

1084
01:19:59,907 --> 01:20:08,350
[SPEAKER_17]: And I just, I believe the reason this did end up on the agenda is we received emails about these projects asking for our support for them.

1085
01:20:08,710 --> 01:20:20,094
[SPEAKER_17]: I was unclear as to what that entailed and kind of responded asking whether that was asking if we were going to approve these projects for appropriation or otherwise have some sort of feedback.

1086
01:20:20,734 --> 01:20:22,515
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think that's how they ended up on the agenda.

1087
01:20:23,431 --> 01:20:26,015
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, and I believe where we left the last meeting was.

1088
01:20:26,035 --> 01:20:36,350
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, that the chief of staff would report back to us, but then if we say voted these down, they may move forward with the projects anyway.

1089
01:20:38,545 --> 01:20:55,188
[SPEAKER_17]: And one of the reasons that I have some, not necessarily concerns about the substance, but concerns about process and future process actually pertains to the next two items, the technology items for IT help desk support and premium Microsoft Office 365, the backup system.

1090
01:20:56,488 --> 01:21:04,930
[SPEAKER_17]: Both of these seem like helpful services for the city to have, but compared to the other three,

1091
01:21:07,533 --> 01:21:15,076
[SPEAKER_17]: items in this paper, those seem to be payments for contracted services versus payments for one-time capital costs.

1092
01:21:16,077 --> 01:21:31,843
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm just wondering if there has been discussion about how this additional $450,000 in services are going to be paid for after ARPA funding expires at the end of the 24-month period mentioned in the document.

1093
01:21:33,160 --> 01:21:33,880
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1094
01:21:33,940 --> 01:21:42,064
[SPEAKER_08]: I do see Jim Silva on the call, who I believe can speak to this Jim if you could give me an address for the record and also just let us know in what capacity you're working with the city.

1095
01:21:43,324 --> 01:21:44,485
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, good evening.

1096
01:21:44,505 --> 01:21:48,887
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Jim Silva special project coordinator for the office of male lingo current.

1097
01:21:49,925 --> 01:21:54,229
[SPEAKER_01]: I am also a small business owner, I have a technology and support business.

1098
01:21:54,989 --> 01:22:01,875
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of my journey in being part time for Mailungu Kern is one of my projects is IT.

1099
01:22:02,515 --> 01:22:04,877
[SPEAKER_01]: I have stepped into the IT support role.

1100
01:22:06,198 --> 01:22:24,345
[SPEAKER_01]: What both of these AAPA requests are about are the possibility to work, have a help desk support system in place, which we have established that allows support services for between 70 and 100 calls on a monthly basis.

1101
01:22:25,552 --> 01:22:42,600
[SPEAKER_01]: What we're hopeful to do, this project being, is having the support services in place so when a director of IT and staff comes into place, they can focus in on issues that need to be addressed that might've been put aside the last couple of years because of the pandemic.

1102
01:22:43,340 --> 01:22:49,583
[SPEAKER_01]: Specifically, we have servers, we have some other equipment that are going to be sunsetted within the next year.

1103
01:22:50,423 --> 01:22:59,665
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have an opportunity to work at stakeholders in City Hall to mitigate some of their needs to upgrade product, to update process.

1104
01:23:00,525 --> 01:23:03,146
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of our legacy products are no longer supported.

1105
01:23:03,746 --> 01:23:07,887
[SPEAKER_01]: So this gives us an opportunity of two years, two years of support.

1106
01:23:08,367 --> 01:23:15,569
[SPEAKER_01]: So our director and staff can focus on upgrading and developing and keeping it in a secure environment.

1107
01:23:16,329 --> 01:23:23,192
[SPEAKER_01]: The positive part about this is it also provides 24-hour monitoring during that two-year period.

1108
01:23:24,453 --> 01:23:32,537
[SPEAKER_01]: This will give us a much better opportunity to look at budgeting needs, seeing what is important, what needs to be addressed,

1109
01:23:32,977 --> 01:23:40,659
[SPEAKER_01]: and giving our stakeholders, which are folks in City Hall, DPW, the opportunity to work in developing that process.

1110
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:51,843
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is sort of a stopgap measure, something that needs to be put into place, something that we see as an opportunity to bring us a little much further forward.

1111
01:23:52,343 --> 01:23:57,785
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of the Office 365 allows us to look into the governance, the opportunity to

1112
01:23:58,465 --> 01:24:05,810
[SPEAKER_01]: take information out as laws change, and it's a much more robust product than we currently have.

1113
01:24:06,431 --> 01:24:14,357
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, this gives us an opportunity to grow, to have a more secure environment, and give us the resources to do that.

1114
01:24:15,277 --> 01:24:20,800
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of this supports services, and it provides us with engineering staff that we don't currently have.

1115
01:24:21,260 --> 01:24:26,943
[SPEAKER_01]: It provides us with 26 different additional people that can support people in City Hall.

1116
01:24:27,483 --> 01:24:36,768
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we've seen, as well as DPW, what we've seen is we've seen turnaround times being a couple of hours, a couple of days versus weeks oftentimes.

1117
01:24:36,868 --> 01:24:43,932
[SPEAKER_01]: So meeting those obligations are important, and it will give the IT director, whoever in the future that may be,

1118
01:24:44,392 --> 01:24:51,476
[SPEAKER_01]: the opportunity to work in improving that process and improving, again, the infrastructure at the city.

1119
01:24:54,498 --> 01:24:55,319
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. Silva.

1120
01:24:55,899 --> 01:24:58,160
[SPEAKER_08]: Any questions, discussion from the council?

1121
01:24:58,181 --> 01:25:00,282
[SPEAKER_17]: Madam President.

1122
01:25:00,922 --> 01:25:01,703
[SPEAKER_08]: Vice President Behrs.

1123
01:25:02,303 --> 01:25:04,284
[SPEAKER_17]: Do we have Director Dickinson with us still?

1124
01:25:04,304 --> 01:25:13,530
[SPEAKER_09]: I do not see him.

1125
01:25:14,890 --> 01:25:19,351
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, and Jim, I'll ask you, and it may be out of your wheelhouse, so I totally understand that.

1126
01:25:21,072 --> 01:25:35,376
[SPEAKER_17]: It sounds like the intent is that the IT help desk support services may be temporary, but my understanding of the Microsoft 365 product is that, you know, you're paying a monthly or an annual subscription fee.

1127
01:25:35,556 --> 01:25:38,117
[SPEAKER_17]: Is the intent that that would continue after the 24-month period?

1128
01:25:39,615 --> 01:25:40,255
[SPEAKER_01]: That's correct.

1129
01:25:40,475 --> 01:25:44,976
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm currently it's it's you're basically buying a licensing services.

1130
01:25:45,516 --> 01:25:48,337
[SPEAKER_01]: So those licensing services will be built into the budget.

1131
01:25:48,717 --> 01:25:55,098
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this is an opportunity again to have the IT director sort of look at the budget, see what the long term goals are.

1132
01:25:56,219 --> 01:26:02,240
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, our infrastructure needs to be improved upon our communication in the building, for instance, needs to be upgraded.

1133
01:26:03,391 --> 01:26:08,036
[SPEAKER_01]: All of those need to have focus and uninterrupted focus as well.

1134
01:26:08,136 --> 01:26:16,484
[SPEAKER_01]: So having a help desk service will provide that focus that's needed for the folks that are internal to the city of Medford.

1135
01:26:18,570 --> 01:26:20,231
[SPEAKER_17]: Thanks, yeah, and I appreciate that.

1136
01:26:20,291 --> 01:26:32,934
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just, you know, whenever I see an ongoing expense being funded with one-time funds, it just goes back to the discussions we were having in the budget around, you know, it's essentially we're just adding to the structural deficit.

1137
01:26:33,855 --> 01:26:38,376
[SPEAKER_17]: And, you know, I don't actually have, I have no question that the services are needed.

1138
01:26:38,416 --> 01:26:42,958
[SPEAKER_17]: I think we've all experienced the IT deficiencies of Medford.

1139
01:26:44,478 --> 01:26:50,642
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's just that long term concern about making sure that in 24 months this doesn't fall away.

1140
01:26:51,382 --> 01:27:06,632
[SPEAKER_01]: So, exactly, and I'm hopeful that this will give those folks an opportunity to have a three year plan a five year plan to work in developing a budget that would allow that sort of sun setting equipment, putting things out that that no longer will work.

1141
01:27:07,452 --> 01:27:09,132
[SPEAKER_01]: improving upon process.

1142
01:27:09,512 --> 01:27:14,714
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the ultimate goal is to support community and support the infrastructure of the community.

1143
01:27:14,814 --> 01:27:19,394
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're hopeful that this is where we're going with this process.

1144
01:27:21,195 --> 01:27:22,835
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just a step in that direction.

1145
01:27:23,935 --> 01:27:24,335
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1146
01:27:24,736 --> 01:27:28,376
[SPEAKER_17]: I do have a motion, but I'll wait until my fellow councilors have had a chance to speak.

1147
01:27:29,977 --> 01:27:30,257
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1148
01:27:30,377 --> 01:27:31,017
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1149
01:27:34,316 --> 01:27:35,177
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam President.

1150
01:27:35,217 --> 01:27:36,578
[SPEAKER_06]: And thank you, Mr. Sullivan.

1151
01:27:37,478 --> 01:27:39,800
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't realize that was your capacity to work with it.

1152
01:27:39,820 --> 01:27:42,221
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad to see that we're using your expertise.

1153
01:27:42,281 --> 01:27:49,086
[SPEAKER_06]: But again, this is what I was I was asking to same thing that the same grounds as Council beers.

1154
01:27:49,626 --> 01:27:53,569
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that you said that we can add this to our budget, Mr. Silva.

1155
01:27:54,209 --> 01:27:57,711
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the problem, my friend, we don't know what the budget is.

1156
01:27:59,047 --> 01:28:04,612
[SPEAKER_06]: So I understand that we have this ARPA money right now for these jobs.

1157
01:28:04,652 --> 01:28:14,260
[SPEAKER_06]: And when you look at what we're looking with the fire department, and as much as I don't like the traffic and parking, you're talking about something tangible that's going to be fixed.

1158
01:28:14,320 --> 01:28:22,126
[SPEAKER_06]: When we're looking at our IT department, this will support something right now.

1159
01:28:22,606 --> 01:28:26,109
[SPEAKER_06]: But if we don't have enough staff, we don't have a budget that'll

1160
01:28:27,371 --> 01:28:39,519
[SPEAKER_06]: um, withstand, um, the concerns that I'm saying are what the mayor had mentioned last year during the budget season that, um, you know, that we're going to, we're going to be looking at some dire situations again.

1161
01:28:39,959 --> 01:28:45,843
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this right now putting money into something that as much as we need it, and I agree with you, we do need it.

1162
01:28:46,504 --> 01:28:51,647
[SPEAKER_06]: But again, is it going to be putting it to something that then we can't man.

1163
01:28:53,043 --> 01:29:03,065
[SPEAKER_06]: that don't have the funding to staff and not having someone at the other end to answer at that IT desk for that support.

1164
01:29:03,125 --> 01:29:06,366
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, and we just haven't seen anything.

1165
01:29:07,206 --> 01:29:12,188
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been saying this at every meeting until we have an understanding of what our budget looks like.

1166
01:29:12,228 --> 01:29:13,188
[SPEAKER_06]: This is what I'm afraid of.

1167
01:29:14,048 --> 01:29:16,970
[SPEAKER_06]: You know we weren't I was I was the same same type of situation.

1168
01:29:16,990 --> 01:29:22,254
[SPEAKER_06]: We talked about the 3 1 1 you know unveiling years ago that we said.

1169
01:29:22,674 --> 01:29:23,575
[SPEAKER_06]: And I said it myself.

1170
01:29:23,635 --> 01:29:26,096
[SPEAKER_06]: I said how how do we have a 3 1 1 system.

1171
01:29:26,116 --> 01:29:28,578
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't have the infrastructure in place to support that.

1172
01:29:29,158 --> 01:29:37,364
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is what I'm afraid that this is not 3 1 1 system all over again because we're starting to put money into situations and different processes that

1173
01:29:38,879 --> 01:29:44,802
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't know budgetarily if we can even support that in the next budget cycle.

1174
01:29:44,842 --> 01:29:48,224
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is what I'm fearful of.

1175
01:29:48,264 --> 01:29:55,188
[SPEAKER_06]: So just thank you for listening to my concerns, but that's what it is.

1176
01:29:55,248 --> 01:29:55,969
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you.

1177
01:29:56,309 --> 01:30:02,913
[SPEAKER_01]: If I could add to that, to your question, actually, we do have communication budget that's in force and in place.

1178
01:30:03,433 --> 01:30:09,197
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a little bit more on an annual basis that we currently spend so it's sort of an upgrade to what we have.

1179
01:30:09,697 --> 01:30:15,441
[SPEAKER_01]: We have additional staffing needs, and we are looking at a full office preview.

1180
01:30:16,021 --> 01:30:17,182
[SPEAKER_01]: What we're proposing here.

1181
01:30:17,562 --> 01:30:21,205
[SPEAKER_01]: So the money is already there, it's, it's a little additional funding.

1182
01:30:21,605 --> 01:30:27,287
[SPEAKER_01]: When I say a little, it's a couple of thousand dollars in a six-month period.

1183
01:30:27,687 --> 01:30:29,647
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's within the budget that we currently have.

1184
01:30:29,667 --> 01:30:39,330
[SPEAKER_01]: We just have a much more robust product that allows us to actually have the opportunity of controlling communication, controlling who has access.

1185
01:30:40,070 --> 01:30:45,752
[SPEAKER_01]: When somebody leaves or somebody comes, we have those resources to provide them with that information.

1186
01:30:46,292 --> 01:30:47,313
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I understand.

1187
01:30:47,333 --> 01:30:49,975
[SPEAKER_06]: I thank you for the, for the, uh, the knowledge that you're sharing.

1188
01:30:50,015 --> 01:30:59,681
[SPEAKER_06]: I just, like I said, I'm just, you know, what was left in, in June was the comment that was resonating that it's going to be so bad.

1189
01:30:59,701 --> 01:31:07,947
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, is it going to be so bad that the mayor says we need to take this money out of the communication line to support fire police?

1190
01:31:07,967 --> 01:31:09,128
[SPEAKER_06]: That's, that's what I'm fearful of.

1191
01:31:09,148 --> 01:31:11,249
[SPEAKER_06]: So, but thank you for your input.

1192
01:31:11,289 --> 01:31:11,970
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate it.

1193
01:31:14,163 --> 01:31:15,144
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1194
01:31:15,224 --> 01:31:21,088
[SPEAKER_08]: Any further discussion on the IT papers or the IT requests we're looking at?

1195
01:31:23,849 --> 01:31:24,650
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. Silva.

1196
01:31:24,670 --> 01:31:29,713
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we do have a request regarding parking and parking meters.

1197
01:31:29,733 --> 01:31:33,816
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if we have anyone from the parking department here to speak on this.

1198
01:31:38,319 --> 01:31:39,300
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Clerk, do you know if anyone,

1199
01:31:40,666 --> 01:31:42,947
[SPEAKER_08]: The parking department was going to join.

1200
01:31:42,967 --> 01:31:44,167
[SPEAKER_08]: I can check my.

1201
01:31:45,107 --> 01:31:49,628
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that the parking director reached out and, and, uh, got another copy of the agenda today.

1202
01:31:49,788 --> 01:31:52,269
[SPEAKER_07]: So she would, uh, be able to speak tonight.

1203
01:31:52,369 --> 01:31:57,610
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't, I think I saw her on here earlier, but I, I don't see her on here right now.

1204
01:31:57,650 --> 01:31:58,570
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just, I'm just looking.

1205
01:31:58,590 --> 01:31:59,771
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1206
01:32:00,051 --> 01:32:00,371
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1207
01:32:01,131 --> 01:32:05,872
[SPEAKER_06]: I would recommend the table if she's not, if there isn't a representative, not a president, her point.

1208
01:32:09,310 --> 01:32:10,290
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1209
01:32:10,350 --> 01:32:12,691
[SPEAKER_08]: I do see Chief Friedman with your hand up once more.

1210
01:32:15,252 --> 01:32:15,993
[SPEAKER_09]: Please go ahead.

1211
01:32:17,593 --> 01:32:22,935
[SPEAKER_18]: I just wanted to speak a little bit more about this request.

1212
01:32:23,055 --> 01:32:28,818
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, this is something that is slowly needed in the fight.

1213
01:32:29,058 --> 01:32:32,619
[SPEAKER_18]: I think this discommunication is something

1214
01:32:33,380 --> 01:32:34,441
[SPEAKER_18]: We've been trying to get for years.

1215
01:32:34,521 --> 01:32:35,442
[SPEAKER_18]: It's one of my goals.

1216
01:32:35,482 --> 01:32:40,645
[SPEAKER_18]: My actual goal is for you to bring us into the technology era.

1217
01:32:42,166 --> 01:32:46,729
[SPEAKER_18]: But I wanted to speak a little bit about the... You're coming through, Chief.

1218
01:32:46,749 --> 01:32:47,870
[SPEAKER_08]: You're coming through a little warbled.

1219
01:32:50,472 --> 01:32:50,792
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1220
01:32:50,832 --> 01:32:53,314
[SPEAKER_08]: And maybe if you want to turn your video off sometimes that helps.

1221
01:32:54,014 --> 01:32:55,435
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1222
01:32:55,455 --> 01:32:57,917
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe if you want to turn your video off sometimes that helps.

1223
01:32:57,937 --> 01:32:58,117
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1224
01:32:58,137 --> 01:32:58,918
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me do that for you.

1225
01:33:01,059 --> 01:33:01,279
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1226
01:33:01,299 --> 01:33:01,660
[SPEAKER_09]: How's that?

1227
01:33:01,720 --> 01:33:02,120
[SPEAKER_09]: Any better?

1228
01:33:02,956 --> 01:33:03,496
[SPEAKER_09]: A little bit better.

1229
01:33:03,516 --> 01:33:05,778
[SPEAKER_09]: A little bit better.

1230
01:33:06,439 --> 01:33:06,759
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1231
01:33:06,779 --> 01:33:23,312
[SPEAKER_02]: So what, you know, what happens right now, if we have a computer that, um, for example, fails and we have a bunch of data in that computer, that computer is lost that data and this system, it's a backup system.

1232
01:33:23,352 --> 01:33:30,858
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, even if that computer, uh, the hardware failed for whatever reason, this backup system will be able to recover it.

1233
01:33:31,502 --> 01:33:40,404
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can tell you being on the fire department for 28 years, that has happened to me before where I worked in other positions and a computer will fail.

1234
01:33:40,444 --> 01:33:46,405
[SPEAKER_02]: We will get a power surge or something causes a failure and you have to recreate all that data.

1235
01:33:46,445 --> 01:33:49,426
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes it's very difficult, time-consuming.

1236
01:33:50,106 --> 01:33:53,567
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this stuff all ties in with the network.

1237
01:33:53,847 --> 01:33:59,748
[SPEAKER_02]: When we put the network in, we'll be able to back everything up and it'll prevent that type of failure.

1238
01:34:00,472 --> 01:34:01,533
[SPEAKER_02]: from happening in the future.

1239
01:34:02,253 --> 01:34:13,960
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just wanted to get that out there that this is not something that like an extra thing we're putting in, this is something that's sorely needed to increase our reliability and prevent us from having these failures.

1240
01:34:16,422 --> 01:34:16,882
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Chief.

1241
01:34:16,902 --> 01:34:17,703
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1242
01:34:18,423 --> 01:34:19,784
[SPEAKER_08]: Going to Councilor Carviel.

1243
01:34:22,906 --> 01:34:23,887
[SPEAKER_05]: Hope you just made yourself.

1244
01:34:25,504 --> 01:34:27,165
[SPEAKER_05]: My question is on the parking.

1245
01:34:27,545 --> 01:34:32,068
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this the second time we funded the parking departments?

1246
01:34:32,088 --> 01:34:35,571
[SPEAKER_05]: If I'm not mistaken?

1247
01:34:36,031 --> 01:34:36,652
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe so.

1248
01:34:36,672 --> 01:34:37,612
[SPEAKER_08]: Jim, can you speak to that?

1249
01:34:37,632 --> 01:34:38,073
[SPEAKER_08]: I see you.

1250
01:34:39,914 --> 01:34:42,516
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, they can't be unmuted.

1251
01:34:42,996 --> 01:34:45,198
[SPEAKER_01]: So she can answer your question.

1252
01:34:45,358 --> 01:34:46,319
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, here we go.

1253
01:34:46,419 --> 01:34:49,041
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1254
01:34:51,082 --> 01:34:53,584
[SPEAKER_08]: I just lost.

1255
01:34:53,744 --> 01:34:54,245
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, there's okay.

1256
01:34:55,124 --> 01:34:56,585
[SPEAKER_08]: Apologies, Faye.

1257
01:34:57,146 --> 01:35:05,133
[SPEAKER_08]: Parking Director Morrison, we'll go to you if you want to briefly speak to this paper and then Councilor Carvalho, we can go back to your question.

1258
01:35:07,975 --> 01:35:09,297
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening, President Morrell.

1259
01:35:10,398 --> 01:35:13,901
[SPEAKER_11]: This is, well, I don't know if I would call it the second time.

1260
01:35:14,001 --> 01:35:17,324
[SPEAKER_11]: I came, I submitted in June,

1261
01:35:19,420 --> 01:35:21,281
[SPEAKER_11]: replacing all of the city.

1262
01:35:22,381 --> 01:35:27,404
[SPEAKER_11]: The decision was made by the ARPA committee to just do Medford Square.

1263
01:35:28,144 --> 01:35:32,106
[SPEAKER_11]: So now they want to do the other squares as well.

1264
01:35:33,126 --> 01:35:41,050
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's why we're before you tonight to get that additional funding to do the additional locations.

1265
01:35:43,471 --> 01:35:44,351
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Director Morrison.

1266
01:35:45,632 --> 01:35:46,112
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Carvillo.

1267
01:35:49,276 --> 01:35:49,556
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on.

1268
01:35:49,857 --> 01:35:50,838
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Madam President.

1269
01:35:51,278 --> 01:35:57,685
[SPEAKER_05]: No, my question is so this is so we're up over half a million dollars in funding for from opera.

1270
01:35:57,705 --> 01:35:58,185
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that correct?

1271
01:36:01,629 --> 01:36:02,710
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be correct.

1272
01:36:03,130 --> 01:36:03,311
Yeah.

1273
01:36:04,272 --> 01:36:04,432
[SPEAKER_11]: And

1274
01:36:05,991 --> 01:36:16,861
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry to interrupt you, Councilor Caviello, but understand that I feel like I'm coming behind Jim who had better lines on this than myself.

1275
01:36:17,462 --> 01:36:29,672
[SPEAKER_11]: You're up against equipment that is almost a decade old, that is failing and getting complaints every day, that had no upkeep and we need to do,

1276
01:36:30,453 --> 01:36:37,989
[SPEAKER_11]: you have to do something in order to provide service to the community or else we're just frustrating them and

1277
01:36:40,298 --> 01:36:44,299
[SPEAKER_11]: causing them to have issues when they're trying to park in our city.

1278
01:36:45,119 --> 01:36:50,860
[SPEAKER_11]: This is not asking because we know the money's there.

1279
01:36:51,381 --> 01:36:53,581
[SPEAKER_11]: The need is there, and that's why we're here.

1280
01:36:53,901 --> 01:37:06,044
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, wanting to finish the rest of the village centers, the squares, so that every business out there that can have the same benefit that I'm hearing that Medford Square businesses are having.

1281
01:37:07,044 --> 01:37:10,165
[SPEAKER_11]: by having accurate enforcement with those meters.

1282
01:37:10,265 --> 01:37:14,146
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's why we're back today trying to get the job finished.

1283
01:37:15,427 --> 01:37:18,848
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we call this a benefit to the business community?

1284
01:37:19,208 --> 01:37:26,851
[SPEAKER_11]: I absolutely have seen the benefit of it from the response that I've received, especially on the censored meeting.

1285
01:37:26,891 --> 01:37:33,253
[SPEAKER_11]: You have a lot of timed parking in your squares.

1286
01:37:34,073 --> 01:37:45,716
[SPEAKER_11]: and to have a meter that's able to properly censor that and keep those free and open to the businesses and being used properly, that's the feedback that I'm getting.

1287
01:37:45,736 --> 01:37:55,319
[SPEAKER_11]: And I knew that once those businesses were happy with it, I knew that the other centers would want the same thing.

1288
01:37:55,739 --> 01:38:00,260
[SPEAKER_11]: And so we're just trying to make sure that we are serving all of the businesses

1289
01:38:00,880 --> 01:38:06,045
[SPEAKER_11]: fairly and equally and not just favoring one over any other.

1290
01:38:06,466 --> 01:38:19,019
[SPEAKER_11]: And so that's our only intent to try to bring this upgraded system that I absolutely feel has been a benefit because that's the feedback that I'm getting from the chamber and from the businesses in Medford Square.

1291
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:21,622
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, my other question.

1292
01:38:21,662 --> 01:38:21,742
[SPEAKER_05]: So,

1293
01:38:23,553 --> 01:38:26,055
[SPEAKER_05]: we're going to be doing West Medford Square, correct?

1294
01:38:27,195 --> 01:38:32,098
[SPEAKER_11]: We would be doing any additional square that's left that has kiosks in it right now.

1295
01:38:32,559 --> 01:38:42,104
[SPEAKER_11]: We would be putting in the poles just as we did in Medford Square, and then installing the meter heads and then removing the old meters.

1296
01:38:42,144 --> 01:38:52,491
[SPEAKER_11]: The exact same process would happen with every additional square that is identified by the city as a business square.

1297
01:38:53,431 --> 01:38:54,151
[SPEAKER_11]: to do.

1298
01:38:55,531 --> 01:38:58,672
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so my question is how far outside of these squares are we going to be going?

1299
01:38:58,692 --> 01:39:03,773
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we going to do like we did all the way down to the church and we still have to do this on Boynton Road?

1300
01:39:04,233 --> 01:39:07,254
[SPEAKER_11]: The mayor has the map.

1301
01:39:07,674 --> 01:39:08,854
[SPEAKER_08]: I have the floor right now.

1302
01:39:08,934 --> 01:39:13,975
[SPEAKER_11]: Director Morrison, I apologize if you could just let Councilmember- I'm sorry, I'm having a hard time hearing, but okay, I'm sorry.

1303
01:39:14,075 --> 01:39:15,335
[SPEAKER_11]: I just thought I heard a question.

1304
01:39:15,395 --> 01:39:15,995
[SPEAKER_11]: My apologies.

1305
01:39:16,035 --> 01:39:19,036
[SPEAKER_05]: How far out of the business districts are we going to go with these meters?

1306
01:39:19,316 --> 01:39:20,776
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we going to do like we did to the square?

1307
01:39:21,215 --> 01:39:22,935
[SPEAKER_05]: and go down to the church and schools.

1308
01:39:23,376 --> 01:39:28,377
[SPEAKER_05]: We still have meters on Boynton Road, which Boynton Road is not in the business district of Medford.

1309
01:39:30,217 --> 01:39:34,618
[SPEAKER_11]: Boynton Road is actually those are sensors, not meters, not paid meters.

1310
01:39:35,079 --> 01:39:35,899
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's time.

1311
01:39:35,939 --> 01:39:37,599
[SPEAKER_11]: If you could let Morrison finish.

1312
01:39:41,708 --> 01:39:44,950
[SPEAKER_11]: Those are what we called sensor head meters.

1313
01:39:45,010 --> 01:39:50,014
[SPEAKER_11]: They are not paid meters, and there has always been an hour limit of parking there.

1314
01:39:50,674 --> 01:39:58,279
[SPEAKER_11]: All those sensors are doing is monitoring the same hour parking there that our parking control specialists have been doing all along.

1315
01:39:58,700 --> 01:40:07,646
[SPEAKER_11]: It just makes their job easier that they have a device there that actually meters when someone pulls in and parks in that space.

1316
01:40:08,306 --> 01:40:12,390
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we have accurate information so that we're not ticketing too soon.

1317
01:40:12,410 --> 01:40:18,636
[SPEAKER_11]: So, can I finish please?

1318
01:40:19,516 --> 01:40:29,666
[SPEAKER_11]: So that we can make sure that we keep those spaces open as they were intended by the ordinance that we have in place, which is one hour parking on those spaces on Boynton Road.

1319
01:40:30,667 --> 01:40:42,131
[SPEAKER_11]: So my question- And to answer your other question about how far we're going to go, maps have been submitted to the executive office, and that will be a decision that they will make moving forward.

1320
01:40:42,712 --> 01:40:47,053
[SPEAKER_05]: So my question is, when did Boynton Road become a business district to get parking meters?

1321
01:40:47,394 --> 01:40:54,216
[SPEAKER_11]: So you're saying that- As I said, they're not parking meters, they are sensors.

1322
01:40:54,736 --> 01:40:57,958
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're not giving any tickets- On that end, can I finish?

1323
01:41:00,422 --> 01:41:04,324
[SPEAKER_11]: On that end of Boynton Road, we have an hour limit on parking.

1324
01:41:04,705 --> 01:41:08,707
[SPEAKER_11]: So we are not exceeding our mandate there in that area.

1325
01:41:09,047 --> 01:41:15,551
[SPEAKER_11]: We are just enforcing the ordinance that's on the books, which is an hour of parking in that area.

1326
01:41:15,891 --> 01:41:18,833
[SPEAKER_11]: As I've said already twice, those are not parking meters.

1327
01:41:19,153 --> 01:41:23,435
[SPEAKER_11]: They may look like meters, but they are actually just timed sensors.

1328
01:41:24,436 --> 01:41:29,279
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're saying to me that if I park at that meter for two hours, I will not get a ticket?

1329
01:41:30,677 --> 01:41:37,978
[SPEAKER_11]: No, you will get a ticket because the only time you're the only time you're allowed to park in that area is one hour I believe, sir.

1330
01:41:41,459 --> 01:41:42,279
[SPEAKER_05]: When did boy.

1331
01:41:42,379 --> 01:41:44,840
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, President district.

1332
01:41:45,500 --> 01:41:45,780
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1333
01:41:45,940 --> 01:41:55,541
[SPEAKER_08]: Director Morrison I guess I think the question I'm trying to understand is you're saying that these are meeting these meters you do not have to pay for they're simply tracking how long someone's parked in a spot.

1334
01:41:56,001 --> 01:41:56,282
[SPEAKER_11]: Correct.

1335
01:41:56,342 --> 01:41:57,142
[SPEAKER_11]: That is correct.

1336
01:41:57,462 --> 01:41:58,022
[SPEAKER_11]: That is correct.

1337
01:42:03,127 --> 01:42:06,888
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to, does that address your questions, Councilor Carvalho?

1338
01:42:07,088 --> 01:42:08,688
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but it doesn't make any difference anyways.

1339
01:42:08,708 --> 01:42:13,129
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, going to Councilor Collins, and then we'll go back to Mr. Silva.

1340
01:42:14,549 --> 01:42:15,490
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, President Morrell.

1341
01:42:16,370 --> 01:42:23,131
[SPEAKER_15]: And thank you to Chief Friedman, Director Morrison, and I wanna say project manager, Jim Silva.

1342
01:42:23,151 --> 01:42:28,472
[SPEAKER_15]: I apologize if I got your title wrong, but it's great to see you working in the city hall in any capacity.

1343
01:42:29,693 --> 01:42:31,933
[SPEAKER_15]: I definitely, as one councilor, I definitely appreciate

1344
01:42:33,063 --> 01:42:41,448
[SPEAKER_15]: the clarity and the context around these funding requests.

1345
01:42:41,508 --> 01:42:46,691
[SPEAKER_15]: Now that we've heard a little bit about each of them, you know, I would be happy to make a motion to

1346
01:42:47,881 --> 01:43:00,485
[SPEAKER_15]: them all or frankly to just receive and place on file, the Chief of Staff made it clear that our votes of approval on these appropriations were not necessary for funding.

1347
01:43:01,305 --> 01:43:03,665
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm not sure if there is a procedural difference.

1348
01:43:06,086 --> 01:43:17,909
[SPEAKER_15]: But, you know, I think that this is, you know, in a best case scenario, this could be a forum for meaningful feedback on the work of these departments.

1349
01:43:18,929 --> 01:43:34,653
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know that we've really seen that play out in our ARPA allocation process so far, which, you know, I think is a part of the allocation process where there's a bit of potential that I hope we can see used a little bit better as we continue to go on and continue to spend down our disbursement.

1350
01:43:36,673 --> 01:43:38,934
[SPEAKER_15]: I would like for the community to have meaningful input.

1351
01:43:38,974 --> 01:43:40,934
[SPEAKER_15]: I would like for this council to have meaningful input.

1352
01:43:40,974 --> 01:43:48,496
[SPEAKER_15]: That's not to say that there's anything I'd really like to critique about the projects before us right now.

1353
01:43:49,757 --> 01:43:53,858
[SPEAKER_15]: These are projects that are being advocated for by the city department heads.

1354
01:43:54,438 --> 01:43:56,639
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not up to us how ARPA is spent.

1355
01:43:57,979 --> 01:43:59,860
[SPEAKER_15]: And so for the purposes of this meeting,

1356
01:44:01,400 --> 01:44:02,222
[SPEAKER_15]: That's good enough for me.

1357
01:44:02,242 --> 01:44:07,113
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that there's a forum for getting more information about each of these projects in particular.

1358
01:44:07,775 --> 01:44:09,138
[SPEAKER_15]: But frankly, I'm not sure that this is it.

1359
01:44:10,450 --> 01:44:21,839
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that the administration wants to let it be known, you know, some of these big buckets that some of our ARPA money is going to be, is considered being committed towards at this point.

1360
01:44:23,220 --> 01:44:24,661
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, message heard loud and clear.

1361
01:44:24,701 --> 01:44:25,321
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that's good.

1362
01:44:25,361 --> 01:44:32,567
[SPEAKER_15]: That's a good start of getting, you know, a bit more on the ball in terms of where those big tracts of our ARPA spending is going.

1363
01:44:32,587 --> 01:44:39,011
[SPEAKER_15]: I hope that we can continue to have that level of back and forth and that we can continue to have meaningful input going forward.

1364
01:44:39,071 --> 01:44:39,612
[SPEAKER_15]: But as for now,

1365
01:44:40,290 --> 01:44:45,411
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, you know, I think that continuing to have that broad stroke kind of conversation is great.

1366
01:44:45,491 --> 01:45:00,636
[SPEAKER_15]: And then if there's nitty gritty on implementation, you know, I'd like to have that in a more dedicated setting, um, so that counselors as well as department heads can be fully equipped to have those kinds, um, of conversations.

1367
01:45:00,716 --> 01:45:04,837
[SPEAKER_15]: So with that, I would, I would motion for approval on, on these five.

1368
01:45:05,607 --> 01:45:06,408
[SPEAKER_15]: appropriations.

1369
01:45:07,228 --> 01:45:15,693
[SPEAKER_15]: And I also I apologize if my words are a little garbled tonight, I am on day four COVID right now so not speaking that well but thank you for letting me know.

1370
01:45:16,533 --> 01:45:24,978
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you Councilor Collins so just to follow up to your motion that the communications from the mayor just state that they're, they're requesting and recommending to allow time for presentation.

1371
01:45:26,812 --> 01:45:34,675
[SPEAKER_15]: Great, then I would I would motion to receive in place on file, if that is the case, but I'm open to open to amendment if other counselors feel differently.

1372
01:45:35,515 --> 01:45:37,396
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to go.

1373
01:45:37,436 --> 01:45:43,258
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, we got a second by counselor saying I'm going to go to Mr. Silver's had his hand up for a while then I'll go to vice president bears.

1374
01:45:43,378 --> 01:45:45,779
[SPEAKER_08]: Going back to you Jim unmute you.

1375
01:45:47,973 --> 01:45:48,313
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1376
01:45:48,593 --> 01:45:54,595
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to state that this is an opportunity, again, to change the infrastructure.

1377
01:45:54,695 --> 01:46:03,117
[SPEAKER_01]: The infrastructure in our community, in our city, has not been kept up to a standard that's necessary to run a process.

1378
01:46:03,257 --> 01:46:12,360
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was a funding opportunity to actually make some changes, some permanent changes, some long-term changes that will support

1379
01:46:13,220 --> 01:46:18,103
[SPEAKER_01]: the folks in City Hall as well as most of the community.

1380
01:46:18,544 --> 01:46:20,385
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, I just want to mention that.

1381
01:46:20,825 --> 01:46:26,329
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of our calls that are helpdesk calls that are currently being supported are infrastructure issues.

1382
01:46:27,010 --> 01:46:33,374
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of the support process will sort of diminish as we're able to improve upon that.

1383
01:46:35,796 --> 01:46:36,356
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Jim.

1384
01:46:37,077 --> 01:46:38,297
[SPEAKER_08]: Going to Vice President Behrs.

1385
01:46:39,078 --> 01:46:39,979
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Madam President.

1386
01:46:41,068 --> 01:46:52,497
[SPEAKER_17]: One question, Jim, for the helpdesk services, you were saying it's for about 70 to 100 helpdesk requests per month.

1387
01:46:53,377 --> 01:47:00,122
[SPEAKER_17]: Was there any consideration of just creating a helpdesk support staff person in-house who could handle that?

1388
01:47:01,163 --> 01:47:03,645
[SPEAKER_17]: It sounds like a reasonable workload for a single staff member.

1389
01:47:10,422 --> 01:47:12,584
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1390
01:47:12,664 --> 01:47:22,555
[SPEAKER_01]: So the answer to your question is, with the funding that we have for employment, it's 70 to 100 calls.

1391
01:47:23,356 --> 01:47:26,540
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a matter of answering a call, but it's also a matter of

1392
01:47:27,671 --> 01:47:31,052
[SPEAKER_01]: Finding out what the problem is and actually mitigating that process.

1393
01:47:31,812 --> 01:47:42,176
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a full time job for it could be one hour worth of work to maybe research, development, all of that process to change something.

1394
01:47:43,236 --> 01:47:50,847
[SPEAKER_01]: The answer to your question is, by having a help desk support as we're outsourcing to a certain degree, they're doing the support.

1395
01:47:50,887 --> 01:47:54,191
[SPEAKER_01]: We have 26 people on staff versus one.

1396
01:47:54,732 --> 01:47:57,736
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is sort of an engineering staff as well.

1397
01:47:57,816 --> 01:47:58,938
[SPEAKER_01]: So if there's something that

1398
01:47:59,638 --> 01:48:15,713
[SPEAKER_01]: is really imperative that needs to be worked on to develop or to infrastructure changes that's outside of your, you know, your skill set, we have that resource in this capacity.

1399
01:48:16,274 --> 01:48:22,600
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really important to consider that as an opportunity to having 26 people for two years.

1400
01:48:23,140 --> 01:48:24,361
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a game changer.

1401
01:48:24,421 --> 01:48:39,669
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think people at City Hall and DPW have seen those changes and have seen and have participated in this opportunity to actually, you know, submit a request and within a matter of hours be able to have that looked at, resolved.

1402
01:48:39,929 --> 01:48:45,793
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, we meet on a weekly basis, so we have an opportunity to see where our problems exist.

1403
01:48:46,473 --> 01:48:49,274
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think you have that luxury with one or two people.

1404
01:48:49,454 --> 01:48:51,555
[SPEAKER_01]: It's impossible.

1405
01:48:51,635 --> 01:49:01,980
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a good opportunity, I think, and a good opportunity to improve upon infrastructure, which will not be such a focus potentially in the future.

1406
01:49:02,080 --> 01:49:04,701
[SPEAKER_01]: And we won't need 26 people anymore.

1407
01:49:04,861 --> 01:49:06,602
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be much more manageable.

1408
01:49:07,422 --> 01:49:08,743
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope that answers your question.

1409
01:49:09,403 --> 01:49:10,684
[SPEAKER_17]: No, that's helpful.

1410
01:49:10,924 --> 01:49:12,845
[SPEAKER_17]: I definitely hear where you're coming from on it.

1411
01:49:14,830 --> 01:49:37,981
[SPEAKER_17]: I would just also, Madam President, propose a B paper that we formally request that the city administration provide a response to whether, as to whether or not the city council will be approving our appropriations above, in excess of $250,000 for appropriation.

1412
01:49:47,356 --> 01:49:48,417
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, vice president bears.

1413
01:49:49,258 --> 01:49:52,682
[SPEAKER_08]: Going I think to.

1414
01:49:53,183 --> 01:49:55,125
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I just want to clarify that.

1415
01:49:55,726 --> 01:50:01,133
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate Jim, you know, giving us the information that we needed with that but I just wanted to

1416
01:50:01,642 --> 01:50:02,902
[SPEAKER_06]: directors to chief Friedman.

1417
01:50:03,302 --> 01:50:09,524
[SPEAKER_06]: I, I, it's not that I don't think that this is an important endeavor that Jim has presented.

1418
01:50:09,784 --> 01:50:11,004
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand that data.

1419
01:50:11,044 --> 01:50:23,326
[SPEAKER_06]: What I'm concerned in is not understanding our budget and how the longevity of the sustainability for whatever we're using our ARPA funding for can be sustained.

1420
01:50:23,347 --> 01:50:24,887
[SPEAKER_06]: I would hate to be

1421
01:50:26,047 --> 01:50:41,362
[SPEAKER_06]: uh during sitting in budget season you sitting across from us and saying we're talking about closing you know a fire station god forbid or or losing firemen and women because we don't have in our budget we don't know what the ramifications are in our budget so

1422
01:50:41,942 --> 01:50:47,125
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not that I don't think that this isn't a great idea, because I think this is an amazing idea.

1423
01:50:47,145 --> 01:50:53,329
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this is exactly where you should be in a community that can handle the sustainability.

1424
01:50:54,270 --> 01:50:56,511
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't know where we are financially.

1425
01:50:57,151 --> 01:50:59,032
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just want the chief to know that.

1426
01:50:59,072 --> 01:51:03,975
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that he jumped in and wanted to defend this amazing process.

1427
01:51:04,035 --> 01:51:04,636
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree with him.

1428
01:51:05,196 --> 01:51:21,001
[SPEAKER_06]: But again, without us seeing the budget numbers, without seeing our finances right now, without understanding where we're going, anything that's not sustainable, that has to be sustained, excuse me, through our general budget, I think it lends to fear in my eyes.

1429
01:51:21,022 --> 01:51:27,004
[SPEAKER_06]: Because if, you know, God, if this was the case, why aren't we funding, you know, the teachers' raises with it then?

1430
01:51:27,584 --> 01:51:33,406
[SPEAKER_06]: Why are we securing, you know, these are the concerns that we have, that everybody has, that we don't have

1431
01:51:34,086 --> 01:51:37,269
[SPEAKER_06]: the funding to sustain this after the ARPA is gone.

1432
01:51:37,729 --> 01:51:40,631
[SPEAKER_06]: So that it's just the same question, just in a different area.

1433
01:51:41,071 --> 01:51:44,474
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just want people to understand that this, I agree with Mr. Silver.

1434
01:51:44,494 --> 01:51:47,436
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's something that it sounds great.

1435
01:51:47,596 --> 01:51:57,504
[SPEAKER_06]: And most functioning communities have unbelievable ID departments like he's talking about that have a high have helped us that all we have to do is send it, send a request to.

1436
01:51:57,564 --> 01:51:59,606
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's, it's beneficial.

1437
01:51:59,666 --> 01:52:00,146
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.

1438
01:52:00,186 --> 01:52:00,626
[SPEAKER_06]: But again,

1439
01:52:01,595 --> 01:52:09,937
[SPEAKER_06]: My fear, again, I'm going to say this all the way until the budget season, because we still have yet to see anything dealing with our finances.

1440
01:52:10,517 --> 01:52:16,678
[SPEAKER_06]: And in my own home, my father taught me, you can't spend what you don't have.

1441
01:52:17,038 --> 01:52:19,479
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why we have a checkbook, that we follow the guidance.

1442
01:52:19,499 --> 01:52:24,800
[SPEAKER_06]: In today's world, we have online banking, so we can follow that every single day.

1443
01:52:25,220 --> 01:52:28,101
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to cut a check for $2,000 if I only have $1,500 in the account, everybody.

1444
01:52:30,461 --> 01:52:31,722
[SPEAKER_06]: This is what we don't have.

1445
01:52:31,802 --> 01:52:35,586
[SPEAKER_06]: These are the basic understandings of finances that we don't have right now.

1446
01:52:35,626 --> 01:52:36,246
[SPEAKER_06]: We can't see.

1447
01:52:36,727 --> 01:52:43,873
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, I know I'm winded, but I just wanted Chief Friedman to understand that that's where I was coming with that comment.

1448
01:52:43,913 --> 01:52:45,754
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you, Madam President.

1449
01:52:47,036 --> 01:52:48,056
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1450
01:52:48,076 --> 01:52:50,258
[SPEAKER_09]: Going back to Councilor Collins, then Vice-President Behrs.

1451
01:52:53,821 --> 01:52:54,442
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, thank you.

1452
01:52:54,462 --> 01:52:57,865
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll defer to Councilor Behrs because he spoke less recently than me.

1453
01:53:00,409 --> 01:53:01,089
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice President Behrs?

1454
01:53:03,090 --> 01:53:04,710
[SPEAKER_08]: Or Vice President Behrs has stepped away and left.

1455
01:53:04,910 --> 01:53:05,330
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, there you go.

1456
01:53:05,991 --> 01:53:11,012
[SPEAKER_17]: No, no, we just have the motion to receive and place on file in the B paper, correct?

1457
01:53:12,332 --> 01:53:13,613
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, you had your hand up still.

1458
01:53:14,453 --> 01:53:15,733
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry, that's accidental.

1459
01:53:16,494 --> 01:53:17,834
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so we'll get back to that.

1460
01:53:18,014 --> 01:53:21,275
[SPEAKER_08]: I see if you... All right, thank you people for lowering your hands.

1461
01:53:21,735 --> 01:53:24,256
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm gonna go to Chief Friedman and then back to you, Councilor Collins.

1462
01:53:33,057 --> 01:53:34,478
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you hear me now?

1463
01:53:35,158 --> 01:53:35,338
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1464
01:53:36,358 --> 01:53:36,678
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1465
01:53:36,698 --> 01:53:49,740
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just wanted to just add this one little tidbit in here that, you know, these, this network that we're talking about installing has a potential to allow cost savings within my budget.

1466
01:53:49,840 --> 01:54:00,122
[SPEAKER_02]: If I can shrug off some of the current, like currently what we do is we, we pay to go over the internet and go over different phone lines and

1467
01:54:00,605 --> 01:54:07,526
[SPEAKER_02]: If we put this network in, and I'm not going to say all of it, cause I like to maintain, the fire department likes to maintain some redundancy.

1468
01:54:07,586 --> 01:54:16,108
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the event, something does go down, we won't be able to get rid of all of it, but I think it has a potential to save some money in the operating budget.

1469
01:54:16,568 --> 01:54:20,608
[SPEAKER_02]: If we get this installed, I can get rid of some of those bills.

1470
01:54:21,309 --> 01:54:29,490
[SPEAKER_02]: So over the longterm, it's going to save money, even though it's a lot of money upfront, the bills that I pay within my operating budget,

1471
01:54:29,890 --> 01:54:33,713
[SPEAKER_02]: to currently communicate the way we are now is very expensive.

1472
01:54:38,307 --> 01:54:40,268
[SPEAKER_06]: Chief, that's exactly what I'm saying, though.

1473
01:54:40,709 --> 01:54:43,210
[SPEAKER_06]: You're saying that you can see savings.

1474
01:54:43,830 --> 01:54:46,752
[SPEAKER_06]: We can't, because we don't have a budget.

1475
01:54:46,832 --> 01:54:50,174
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't have finance paper.

1476
01:54:50,535 --> 01:54:51,495
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all I'm saying.

1477
01:54:51,535 --> 01:54:54,277
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not saying you can see that in your budget.

1478
01:54:54,337 --> 01:54:55,898
[SPEAKER_06]: As a city councilor, we don't know.

1479
01:54:55,918 --> 01:54:59,220
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't have any information budget-wise, financial-wise.

1480
01:54:59,560 --> 01:55:00,221
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all I'm saying.

1481
01:55:00,601 --> 01:55:00,941
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1482
01:55:02,142 --> 01:55:03,703
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, I understand that part.

1483
01:55:04,480 --> 01:55:09,473
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to make you aware that of that potential cost savings.

1484
01:55:09,513 --> 01:55:11,778
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing is the reliability go way up.

1485
01:55:12,320 --> 01:55:13,483
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um,

1486
01:55:14,097 --> 01:55:17,640
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something that absolutely, you know, should have been done a long time ago.

1487
01:55:17,760 --> 01:55:20,302
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, just look at the cost of it.

1488
01:55:20,382 --> 01:55:21,082
[SPEAKER_02]: I can see why.

1489
01:55:21,102 --> 01:55:41,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and this opera fund is exactly, uh, you know, this particular project fits this opera fund model exactly for what it's being requested for is to get us to hook up our communication, get that last mile of, um, network installed so that we can actually communicate properly and reliably.

1490
01:55:42,544 --> 01:55:45,145
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't, I don't speak to your stuff on the budget.

1491
01:55:45,185 --> 01:55:56,228
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, I know some of those, um, I understand your concerns there, but I just want to let you know that as far as what I'm looking at on my end, it's something that's sorely needed.

1492
01:55:56,708 --> 01:56:03,410
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something that can greatly increase the reliability and it has a potential for cost savings for the city.

1493
01:56:03,951 --> 01:56:17,516
[SPEAKER_06]: if I can shut off some of these other bills, which again, I've, I've supported everything that when it comes to fight upon, especially communication, because we realize how, how we're in the dinosaur age and I completely understand that.

1494
01:56:17,596 --> 01:56:18,416
[SPEAKER_06]: And I agree with you.

1495
01:56:18,736 --> 01:56:20,337
[SPEAKER_06]: I support this a thousand percent.

1496
01:56:20,517 --> 01:56:26,139
[SPEAKER_06]: All I'm saying is my fear is without knowing the finances, guys, that's, that's all really I'm saying.

1497
01:56:26,179 --> 01:56:27,479
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't, I don't disagree with you.

1498
01:56:27,519 --> 01:56:31,040
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's, it's something I find women need for their safety.

1499
01:56:31,380 --> 01:56:32,981
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree with you a thousand percent.

1500
01:56:33,749 --> 01:56:34,189
[SPEAKER_06]: Understood.

1501
01:56:36,191 --> 01:56:37,511
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Chief and Councilor Scarpelli.

1502
01:56:37,551 --> 01:56:38,692
[SPEAKER_08]: Going to Councilor Collins.

1503
01:56:39,573 --> 01:56:40,633
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, President Morrell.

1504
01:56:40,693 --> 01:56:54,882
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, to echo Councilor Scarpelli's words of support and other Councilors' words of support, just to emphasize, since I didn't earlier, even if we were voting for approval, even if approval were up to us,

1505
01:56:55,366 --> 01:57:03,149
[SPEAKER_15]: I would have no hesitation voting for approval for any of these, for any of these suggested expenditures.

1506
01:57:03,930 --> 01:57:13,294
[SPEAKER_15]: They heard loud and clear the benefits to our city, our community, to our various departments, the projects that these expenditures will fund.

1507
01:57:13,354 --> 01:57:22,118
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't wanna detract from that note of support just because this conversation also brings in sort of the broader threads of,

1508
01:57:23,158 --> 01:57:29,401
[SPEAKER_15]: ARPA's funding in general and how that relates to the overall budget and how that relates to the structural deficit.

1509
01:57:29,481 --> 01:57:40,486
[SPEAKER_15]: I think the point that I'm trying to make through what I've said is that I think with conversations like this with individual department heads, about individual departments, about individual

1510
01:57:41,444 --> 01:57:51,451
[SPEAKER_15]: Expenditures, often they become about the operating budget, they become about the structural deficit, they become about the communication that we receive about the budget.

1511
01:57:52,631 --> 01:58:05,340
[SPEAKER_15]: With city staffers who frankly, I don't think it's fair for us to expect to answer to those questions because we're not getting that communication elsewhere in predictable and routine ways from our central administration.

1512
01:58:06,560 --> 01:58:18,107
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, I'm always glad for the chance to talk about those things with our department heads and our project leaders, but at the same time, that's not the forum that I want for these conversations.

1513
01:58:18,167 --> 01:58:24,131
[SPEAKER_15]: So, you know, I think we can say at the same time, we're concerned about one-time funding.

1514
01:58:25,692 --> 01:58:34,227
[SPEAKER_15]: being used to fund projects that will then, in a couple years, need another funding source, because maybe somebody knows, but I don't happen to know where that funding will come from.

1515
01:58:34,327 --> 01:58:38,835
[SPEAKER_15]: We can say that, and at the same time, we can say, you know, I personally, as one Councillor,

1516
01:58:39,851 --> 01:58:41,873
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm glad that these projects will be funded.

1517
01:58:42,573 --> 01:58:49,541
[SPEAKER_15]: They will be funded because it's up to this administration and the administration, by virtue of the fact that these department heads are here today, they're planning on funding them.

1518
01:58:50,422 --> 01:58:51,883
[SPEAKER_15]: So I just wanted to make that very clear.

1519
01:58:51,923 --> 01:58:54,546
[SPEAKER_15]: I think there's kind of two levels to this conversation.

1520
01:58:54,586 --> 01:58:57,409
[SPEAKER_15]: They're parallel, but these broader concerns

1521
01:58:59,035 --> 01:59:07,121
[SPEAKER_15]: in my understanding, don't take away from the fact that these projects are going to get funded unless, you know, the executive office changes its mind.

1522
01:59:08,242 --> 01:59:10,263
[SPEAKER_15]: And personally, I'm happy about that.

1523
01:59:11,204 --> 01:59:15,346
[SPEAKER_15]: So just to clarify that, and with that, I would move the question.

1524
01:59:15,366 --> 01:59:17,608
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

1525
01:59:18,537 --> 01:59:34,692
[SPEAKER_08]: So on the motion of Councillor Collins to receive in place on file, we also have a B paper that we can take first from vice president bears to request a response from the administration as to whether the council will, it will be requesting approval from the council on appropriation over $250,000.

1526
01:59:34,872 --> 01:59:38,936
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have language you want to read back Mr. Clerk on that?

1527
01:59:40,377 --> 01:59:41,298
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how I had it.

1528
01:59:41,318 --> 01:59:42,199
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1529
01:59:42,766 --> 01:59:42,966
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

1530
01:59:43,686 --> 01:59:49,067
[SPEAKER_08]: So on the B paper from vice president bears, second by a counselor saying Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1531
01:59:49,087 --> 01:59:52,028
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1532
01:59:52,468 --> 01:59:56,428
[SPEAKER_07]: And councilor Scarpelli just informed me that he was having some technical issues.

1533
01:59:56,708 --> 01:59:59,549
[SPEAKER_07]: His, uh, his phone was dying and he was also losing the zoom link.

1534
02:00:00,089 --> 02:00:02,929
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just need to, uh, so he may not be present for this vote.

1535
02:00:02,949 --> 02:00:03,870
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1536
02:00:03,950 --> 02:00:04,830
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1537
02:00:05,730 --> 02:00:10,111
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, we'll call vice president bears.

1538
02:00:11,111 --> 02:00:11,311
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1539
02:00:12,558 --> 02:00:13,319
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Caravaglia.

1540
02:00:14,880 --> 02:00:15,881
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, yes.

1541
02:00:16,161 --> 02:00:16,821
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Collins.

1542
02:00:17,942 --> 02:00:18,162
