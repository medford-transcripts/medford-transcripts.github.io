1
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:07,816
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening, everyone, and welcome to tonight's meeting of the Community Development Board.

2
00:00:08,317 --> 00:00:09,278
[SPEAKER_14]: My name is Emily Hedeman.

3
00:00:09,418 --> 00:00:12,101
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm the board chair, and I'm going to call the meeting to order.

4
00:00:12,962 --> 00:00:15,425
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's begin with some obligatory procedural matters.

5
00:00:16,966 --> 00:00:18,108
[SPEAKER_15]: Recording in progress.

6
00:00:20,892 --> 00:00:35,623

9
00:00:53,843 --> 00:00:59,827

10
00:01:01,468 --> 00:01:07,852
[SPEAKER_14]: And then before I keep going, can I just get a thumbs up from the Zoom crowd to confirm that audio is good for you guys?

17
00:01:52,469 --> 00:01:54,950
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, we're going to start with roll call attendance of the board.

[SPEAKER_14]: And myself, Chair Emily Hedeman is also present.

36
00:02:42,721 --> 00:02:46,725
[SPEAKER_14]: Danielle, can you please introduce any staff at the meeting or on the call?

37
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:55,136
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, thank you, Madam Chair.

38
00:02:55,236 --> 00:02:59,819
[SPEAKER_08]: We have myself, Daniel Evans, senior planner, along with Director Hunt.

39
00:03:03,061 --> 00:03:04,021
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry about that feedback.

40
00:03:06,203 --> 00:03:08,004
[SPEAKER_08]: As well as Christian Cepeda.

41
00:03:08,024 --> 00:03:10,845
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I have to read his name.

42
00:03:14,948 --> 00:03:16,289
[SPEAKER_08]: Lepofsky, sorry, I couldn't.

43
00:03:17,389 --> 00:03:18,650
[SPEAKER_08]: And who else?

44
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:19,551
[SPEAKER_08]: We have Jack.

45
00:03:22,813 --> 00:03:23,373
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, I need

46
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:31,400
[SPEAKER_08]: Podolsky, who is the other graduate student intern on the call tonight.

47
00:03:35,848 --> 00:03:36,348
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks, Danielle.

48
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:42,365
[SPEAKER_14]: And before we begin, I just want to run down the agenda for tonight's meeting.

49
00:03:42,846 --> 00:03:46,831
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to be continuing our public hearing on Medford and West Medford squares.

50
00:03:47,752 --> 00:03:55,982
[SPEAKER_14]: The board will hear a short presentation from Emily and Paula of Innocent Associates and then move into the board discussion and then public comment period.

51
00:03:56,863 --> 00:04:08,547
[SPEAKER_14]: Like last week's meeting, depending on the amount of public participation, the board will take a short recess around 8.30, probably about 10 minutes, and then we're going to reassess at 10 p.m.

52
00:04:08,867 --> 00:04:14,969
[SPEAKER_14]: whether to vote this topic out of the board or to continue to a date certain.

53
00:04:15,629 --> 00:04:23,372
[SPEAKER_14]: That can also be influenced by the comments we hear tonight by the public, so it's not just the timing and logistics of the topic that we're discussing.

54
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:24,252
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to make that clear.

55
00:04:30,063 --> 00:04:42,110
[SPEAKER_14]: And part of the reason why we want to do these reassessments before it gets too late in the evening is because we do value your public feedback, those of you in person and those who have joined by Zoom.

56
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:52,415
[SPEAKER_14]: We want to make sure that we have enough time to digest the feedback and to adequately present it to our consultants so they can implement it in the next round of presentations.

57
00:04:56,813 --> 00:04:59,395
[SPEAKER_14]: Last week, we did a physical sign-up sheet.

58
00:05:00,336 --> 00:05:02,018
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think we'll need that this evening.

59
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:06,662
[SPEAKER_14]: If we do get more people in attendance, we'll reassess.

60
00:05:06,742 --> 00:05:10,405
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think for now, we could just keep it a little bit more informal than last week.

61
00:05:13,058 --> 00:05:15,279
[SPEAKER_14]: And for Zoom, we're gonna use the typical raise hand feature.

62
00:05:16,099 --> 00:05:24,823
[SPEAKER_14]: We are going to be prioritizing in-person comments, just recognizing that it is more challenging to attend in person than remotely via Zoom.

63
00:05:25,343 --> 00:05:29,185
[SPEAKER_14]: So we'll likely process in-person comments and then move on to Zoom.

64
00:05:30,126 --> 00:05:32,887
[SPEAKER_14]: And we appreciate everyone's patience with that approach.

65
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:45,294
[SPEAKER_14]: So with that, I'm gonna move into our agenda item, which is the public hearing for Medford Square and West Medford Square districts.

66
00:05:46,495 --> 00:05:57,000
[SPEAKER_14]: This is the second meeting for the continued public hearing that was open on June 4th regarding the proposed zoning amendment for the creation of Medford Square and West Medford Square districts.

67
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,662
[SPEAKER_14]: Do we have anyone who is subject to

68
00:06:03,538 --> 00:06:07,979
[SPEAKER_14]: who needed to sign their Mullen affidavits to confirm their eligibility for voting?

69
00:06:08,499 --> 00:06:09,459
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't believe we did.

70
00:06:09,859 --> 00:06:10,159
[SPEAKER_14]: We do?

71
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:10,819
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

72
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:21,622
[SPEAKER_08]: Madam Chair, Benjamin Lavallee signed the Mullen affidavit for missing the first session of the public hearing on June 4th.

73
00:06:22,002 --> 00:06:23,042
[SPEAKER_08]: So I received that today.

74
00:06:24,982 --> 00:06:25,202
[SPEAKER_14]: Great.

75
00:06:25,242 --> 00:06:26,383
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for confirming, Danielle.

76
00:06:26,483 --> 00:06:28,143
[SPEAKER_14]: And thank you for taking care of that, Ben.

77
00:06:28,183 --> 00:06:28,703
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciate it.

78
00:06:33,814 --> 00:06:40,071
[SPEAKER_14]: Danielle or Alicia, do you have any introductory comments before we hand it off to Emily and Paola of Innis Associates?

79
00:06:45,178 --> 00:06:59,902
[SPEAKER_06]: I just felt like it would be good to make it just very clear that tonight is a public hearing, as Emily said, on West Medford and Medford Square, and that we had continued the public hearing on the residential and neighborhood residential to July 9th.

80
00:07:00,442 --> 00:07:07,344
[SPEAKER_06]: So if anybody wants to make comments on that, they have to attend that meeting, or they can submit written comments.

81
00:07:07,684 --> 00:07:10,025
[SPEAKER_06]: But because that public hearing is not open,

82
00:07:10,645 --> 00:07:18,774
[SPEAKER_06]: that there will not be an opportunity to speak on that this evening and I just wanted to make sure that was clear in case somebody thought they were here only for that.

83
00:07:19,134 --> 00:07:26,842
[SPEAKER_06]: That that is not going to happen this evening and we're not able to hear comments on that because of the legal process of having a public hearing.

84
00:07:29,857 --> 00:07:36,979
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, thanks for that reminder and recognizing that Medford Square and West Medford Square do not exist in vacuums.

85
00:07:38,299 --> 00:07:51,202
[SPEAKER_14]: Those residential districts will undoubtedly come up, but I would say if you do have comments regarding the residential districts is to, as Alicia said, attend on the 9th, submit a comment virtually.

86
00:07:52,202 --> 00:07:57,103
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a QR code in the back or through the ocdmedford-ma.gov email address.

87
00:08:00,745 --> 00:08:04,628
[SPEAKER_14]: And during the break, if anybody has questions, happy to answer them.

88
00:08:04,709 --> 00:08:09,873
[SPEAKER_14]: And Alicia, Danielle, Christian, and Jack are manning the Zoom chat.

89
00:08:12,496 --> 00:08:16,880
[SPEAKER_14]: So with that, I'm going to pass it off to Emily and Paola.

90
00:08:18,589 --> 00:08:20,010
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you very much, Madam Chair.

91
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:29,717
[SPEAKER_27]: While Paula shares her screen, I will introduce for the record myself, Emily Ennis of Ennis Associates, and I'm here with Paula Ramos Martinez.

92
00:08:30,537 --> 00:08:48,130
[SPEAKER_27]: We are going to walk you through just the sort of the reminder and introduction for those who have been part of this process and for those who are new, and then turn over to changes that have been made based on public comment from your first meeting.

93
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:51,891
[SPEAKER_27]: So with that, if you'll move to the agenda, please.

94
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:54,112
[SPEAKER_27]: Next slide.

95
00:08:54,792 --> 00:08:55,972
[SPEAKER_27]: Once you get to full screen mode.

96
00:08:57,412 --> 00:09:06,595
[SPEAKER_27]: And we will both try, I know with it being in person as well as hybrid, that there can be a little bit of an echo in the city council chambers.

97
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:13,417
[SPEAKER_27]: So we are trying to speak slowly and clearly through these wires of computers.

98
00:09:13,597 --> 00:09:16,898
[SPEAKER_27]: So if at any point you can't hear us, just let us know.

99
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:33,122
[SPEAKER_27]: So with that, I'm going to talk a little bit about the timeline, just in relationship to the squares, the no next meetings, and give a little bit of introduction, and then I will turn it over to Paula for the squares.

100
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:42,846
[SPEAKER_27]: Initially, just to touch briefly on the residential districts, initially they were ahead of the squares.

101
00:09:43,746 --> 00:09:47,668
[SPEAKER_27]: And so the squares included some of the residential districts.

102
00:09:47,868 --> 00:10:00,155
[SPEAKER_27]: You will see from the maps that we have removed those from the squares because we wanted, we didn't want the squares to get ahead of the discussion on the residential districts.

103
00:10:00,723 --> 00:10:12,977
[SPEAKER_27]: So tonight we will be showing and talking about only the mixed-use districts, and that might make some of the what do I speak to tonight versus what do I speak to on July 9th a little bit of an easier discussion.

104
00:10:14,178 --> 00:10:16,281
[SPEAKER_27]: So with that, if you'll go to the next slide, please, Paola.

105
00:10:17,302 --> 00:10:17,702
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

106
00:10:17,802 --> 00:10:21,887
[SPEAKER_27]: This has been the process for the discussion of the squares.

107
00:10:22,438 --> 00:10:32,433
[SPEAKER_27]: We introduced the commercial framework to the planning and permitting committee on March 12th, discuss Medford square on the 26th and West Medford square on the 9th.

108
00:10:33,244 --> 00:10:35,626
[SPEAKER_27]: And then both of them together on April 30th.

109
00:10:35,766 --> 00:10:45,415
[SPEAKER_27]: And these of course are all public meetings brought it forward because the city council referred it to this board, the community development board.

110
00:10:45,475 --> 00:10:48,878
[SPEAKER_27]: So we discussed it at our first meeting with you on May 8th.

111
00:10:49,439 --> 00:10:58,126
[SPEAKER_27]: We had a public listening session on the 4th of June, and then here we are today to talk about it for the second meeting with the community development board.

112
00:10:59,067 --> 00:10:59,768
[SPEAKER_27]: Next slide, please.

113
00:11:01,573 --> 00:11:15,737
[SPEAKER_27]: Um, these are the known, uh, dates, uh, based on discussions, uh, from the, with the community development board last week and some discussions with, uh, um, city staff and trying to firm up calendars.

114
00:11:15,857 --> 00:11:26,960
[SPEAKER_27]: I believe I saw on the agenda that city staff is going to talk about this further, so they may have some additional updates, but just to give people an idea of what meetings we see, uh, coming forward.

115
00:11:27,861 --> 00:11:28,601
[SPEAKER_27]: Uh, next slide, please.

116
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:42,032
[SPEAKER_27]: So we've often been asked why why we're doing a rezoning or why the city is doing a rezoning effort and why we're working with them to provide the information that's needed.

117
00:11:42,372 --> 00:11:51,802
[SPEAKER_27]: This comes out of the Medford Massachusetts comprehensive plan, which was approved in January 2023 and has certain goal city over the next.

118
00:11:51,962 --> 00:11:54,145
[SPEAKER_14]: Emily, your audio is getting really low.

119
00:11:54,525 --> 00:11:54,986
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

120
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:56,568
[SPEAKER_27]: I appreciate that.

121
00:11:57,509 --> 00:12:04,517
[SPEAKER_27]: So the Medford Massachusetts Comprehensive Plan, which was adopted in January 2023 has certain goals for

122
00:12:07,841 --> 00:12:13,683
[SPEAKER_27]: housing, economic development, preservation of open space, and other components.

123
00:12:14,343 --> 00:12:17,704
[SPEAKER_27]: Some out of those goals come some zoning recommendations.

124
00:12:18,284 --> 00:12:25,746
[SPEAKER_27]: In addition, the city adopted a climate action and adaptation plan that also had recommendations for zoning changes.

125
00:12:26,386 --> 00:12:32,788
[SPEAKER_27]: It's these two documents that have kick-started the process of looking more in-depth at the zoning.

126
00:12:33,368 --> 00:12:38,731
[SPEAKER_27]: The city has been working on zoning changes since the recodification began in 2020.

127
00:12:39,451 --> 00:12:47,755
[SPEAKER_27]: Some of our language around corridors, squares, and neighborhoods is coming from this future land use map that you see in front of you.

128
00:12:48,256 --> 00:12:56,260
[SPEAKER_27]: So just for those people who may not have been part of the earlier part of this process, that's what kicked all of this off were these two documents.

129
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:03,608
[SPEAKER_27]: And then we have been working with the city, as I said, to provide information, options, materials for discussion.

130
00:13:05,149 --> 00:13:07,272
[SPEAKER_27]: And with that, for the next slide, please.

131
00:13:10,338 --> 00:13:18,323
[SPEAKER_27]: Part of what we've been hearing is questions and concerns about what does this mean for my property or my neighborhood.

132
00:13:18,743 --> 00:13:26,147
[SPEAKER_27]: So we did put all of the information onto an interactive online map and people can go there.

133
00:13:26,187 --> 00:13:30,770
[SPEAKER_27]: If you go to the next slide, Pally, we can provide the link to you to that map.

134
00:13:32,391 --> 00:13:33,752
[SPEAKER_27]: There's a lot of information.

135
00:13:33,932 --> 00:13:46,120
[SPEAKER_27]: It is a little clunky, but you can change the layers, you can change filters, and you can also click on individual parcels and see what's happening on the different lots.

136
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:52,805
[SPEAKER_27]: There is a video on the City's website for this zoning effort that explains how to use it.

137
00:13:53,605 --> 00:13:57,889
[SPEAKER_27]: So if you haven't used it and you're interested in learning more, I recommend that.

138
00:13:58,309 --> 00:14:05,314
[SPEAKER_27]: We have also been trying to build additional tools, and you will see some of them today to understand what's happening where.

139
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:20,125
[SPEAKER_27]: And so with that, with that introduction and a guide to maybe some of the tools that we have available for you, and we are continuing to build more in response to public comment, to kind of parse this information, I'm going to turn it over to Paola

140
00:14:20,865 --> 00:14:26,628
[SPEAKER_27]: talk specifically about the squares and potential changes for the board's consideration.

141
00:14:30,511 --> 00:14:31,651
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Emily.

142
00:14:31,851 --> 00:14:35,233
[SPEAKER_07]: If I may, Madam Chair, I'm going to continue with the presentation.

143
00:14:36,254 --> 00:14:37,815
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me know if you hear me okay.

144
00:14:38,215 --> 00:14:39,936
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty low.

145
00:14:40,436 --> 00:14:40,676
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

146
00:14:40,837 --> 00:14:42,397
[SPEAKER_07]: I can maybe rise my voice.

147
00:14:42,778 --> 00:14:43,338
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe it's that.

148
00:14:43,478 --> 00:14:43,918
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

149
00:14:44,779 --> 00:14:46,380
[SPEAKER_14]: It's going to feel like you're yelling, but just yell.

150
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:47,380
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

151
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:47,841
[SPEAKER_07]: Perfect.

152
00:14:49,582 --> 00:14:53,905
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm just going to start with the zoning and the proposals.

153
00:14:56,267 --> 00:15:11,900
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to go fast because we've already seen this and I want to focus more on the recommendations, but if anyone has any questions feel very free to ask and we can go back, we can go to the draft and

154
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:15,402
[SPEAKER_07]: we can answer and take the time that you need.

155
00:15:16,563 --> 00:15:18,864
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is about the existing zoning.

156
00:15:18,904 --> 00:15:23,906
[SPEAKER_07]: We are looking into two squares, Medford Square and West Medford Square.

157
00:15:25,086 --> 00:15:26,707
[SPEAKER_07]: We are going to start with Medford Square.

158
00:15:26,987 --> 00:15:34,971
[SPEAKER_07]: So we see it here, the location in Medford and we are going to have a zoom in

159
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:40,736
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the existing, the current condition.

160
00:15:41,937 --> 00:15:52,609
[SPEAKER_07]: What you see in this dash black line is the first or the boundaries of the Medford square.

161
00:15:54,331 --> 00:16:02,038
[SPEAKER_07]: As you can see in here, the existing districts you have are these pink ones, is the commercial one.

162
00:16:03,359 --> 00:16:06,101
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we have in the slides all the things that can be done.

163
00:16:06,141 --> 00:16:08,764
[SPEAKER_07]: It can go up to six stories with residential.

164
00:16:09,244 --> 00:16:14,969
[SPEAKER_07]: Then you have apartment two, it can go up to six stories for residential and then for hotel 15.

165
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:29,683
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we have some general residential, and that is more for single and two units and then single family on the north part of Terrell and Governors Avenue.

166
00:16:33,925 --> 00:16:42,367
[SPEAKER_07]: Here are all the existing and current dimension standards for these two districts.

167
00:16:42,807 --> 00:16:49,068
[SPEAKER_07]: This was the second proposal and the one that was referred from the city council.

168
00:16:49,528 --> 00:16:56,729
[SPEAKER_07]: The proposal that we are bringing here today is going to be the same, nothing changes except for those boundaries.

169
00:16:58,089 --> 00:16:59,690
[SPEAKER_07]: What we are going to do is just to

170
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:10,439
[SPEAKER_07]: take out all the residential areas and only talk about the existing, the mixed districts.

171
00:17:11,913 --> 00:17:16,397
[SPEAKER_07]: And so what you're going to see in both are going to be the same districts.

172
00:17:16,437 --> 00:17:18,799
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to talk about mixed use 1B.

173
00:17:19,219 --> 00:17:22,402
[SPEAKER_07]: This district will only appear here in the Medford Square.

174
00:17:22,802 --> 00:17:34,232
[SPEAKER_07]: We have it in the narrow areas and narrow parcels next to the river where we have some historic buildings.

175
00:17:35,493 --> 00:17:38,476
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we propose the mixed use 1B.

176
00:17:38,556 --> 00:17:39,817
[SPEAKER_07]: It goes up to four stories.

177
00:17:40,297 --> 00:17:44,518
[SPEAKER_07]: Then we have the next one in intensity will be the mixed use 2A.

178
00:17:45,459 --> 00:17:49,120
[SPEAKER_07]: This goes up to five stories by right and plus two with incentive zoning.

179
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:55,322
[SPEAKER_07]: Then we have the purple one that's mixed or used to be more intense.

180
00:17:55,862 --> 00:18:15,279
[SPEAKER_07]: That is seven-story by right and two with incentive zoning, and then mixed-use three, that is only this area next to the 93, and that is mixed-use 3A, actually, and that's eight stories by right plus four with incentive zoning.

181
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,964
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is mainly, there are no changes from the one that we've seen in the previous.

182
00:18:21,664 --> 00:18:26,988
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just the boundaries that have changed to only focus on non-residential.

183
00:18:28,623 --> 00:18:30,144
[SPEAKER_07]: exclusive residential districts.

184
00:18:31,005 --> 00:18:52,099
[SPEAKER_07]: Then when we go to West Medford, we also have the same or similar, at least we have that concentration of that commercial one along the high street and then the place where the commuter rail is to stop.

185
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:55,942
[SPEAKER_07]: There we have that commercial one that goes up to six stories by right,

186
00:18:56,402 --> 00:19:03,125
[SPEAKER_07]: Then we have the general residential, single-family, and apartment one.

187
00:19:03,805 --> 00:19:08,307
[SPEAKER_07]: There is no limit of residential units.

188
00:19:08,327 --> 00:19:09,128
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no cap.

189
00:19:10,428 --> 00:19:11,569
[SPEAKER_07]: It's with the height.

190
00:19:11,749 --> 00:19:15,451
[SPEAKER_07]: It's permitted three stories by right in those areas.

191
00:19:15,471 --> 00:19:16,231
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the existing.

192
00:19:16,311 --> 00:19:20,253
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, we have all the table and dimensional standards if anyone has any question.

193
00:19:21,514 --> 00:19:23,336
[SPEAKER_07]: about the existing, we can talk about it.

194
00:19:24,677 --> 00:19:30,784
[SPEAKER_07]: Then we have the first proposal or the one that we've shown here in the previous.

195
00:19:30,964 --> 00:19:40,936
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, we've done the same, basically take out all the exclusive residential districts and bring only that core of the

196
00:19:43,112 --> 00:19:44,674
[SPEAKER_07]: of the square.

197
00:19:44,774 --> 00:19:53,001
[SPEAKER_07]: So in this one, we don't have so many different as we had in Medforska, we have four gradients of intense mixed use.

198
00:19:53,461 --> 00:20:08,675
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we have two that mix use 2A and mix use 2B, which are up to five stories by right with two with incentive zoning, and then mix use 2B, that purple that goes up to seven stories by right plus two with incentive zoning.

199
00:20:10,832 --> 00:20:24,242
[SPEAKER_07]: So what we have prepared, and we can go through them if anyone is interested, is these different boards where we can have the summary of the square.

200
00:20:26,164 --> 00:20:39,011
[SPEAKER_07]: districts and so we have one board with both of the maps with the districts and then we have the information by building types and then we see the district.

201
00:20:39,031 --> 00:20:42,453
[SPEAKER_07]: So what can I do in each of the districts?

202
00:20:42,993 --> 00:20:48,877
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we see that, for example, mixed use 1B we have from three unit dwelling that is permitted.

203
00:20:49,578 --> 00:20:51,659
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not permitted in the other districts.

204
00:20:52,059 --> 00:20:57,003
[SPEAKER_07]: Historic conversion is permitted only in MX1B and 2A.

205
00:20:57,763 --> 00:21:01,125
[SPEAKER_07]: Minimum three units for 1B, minimum four units for 2A.

206
00:21:02,686 --> 00:21:03,107
[SPEAKER_07]: etc.

207
00:21:03,147 --> 00:21:12,334
[SPEAKER_07]: And so what building types are allowed in each of the districts in a very simple way that we can see that bigger picture.

208
00:21:12,814 --> 00:21:19,939
[SPEAKER_07]: And then in case it's difficult to understand what we are talking about, there is a definition of each of those building types.

209
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:27,965
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, whenever applies incentive zoning, we have also clarified that in this table.

210
00:21:29,526 --> 00:21:29,746
[SPEAKER_07]: And then

211
00:21:30,933 --> 00:21:34,555
[SPEAKER_07]: We do another table, and that is with the dimensional standards.

212
00:21:34,675 --> 00:21:38,557
[SPEAKER_07]: So that is also easy to see all of the dimensional standards in one table.

213
00:21:39,058 --> 00:21:52,065
[SPEAKER_07]: And with all of the districts together, we have all the different standards, and then the diagram to understand better, and then words in an image.

214
00:21:52,265 --> 00:21:59,690
[SPEAKER_07]: You see what we are talking about, what is the frontage, what is active ground floor, and all of these different standards.

215
00:22:01,411 --> 00:22:03,512
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that is easy to compare.

216
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:15,381
[SPEAKER_27]: And Paola, if I could just jump very quickly in, just so everybody online or in the room knows, we have provided these as PDFs for the city to post on their website.

217
00:22:15,721 --> 00:22:21,546
[SPEAKER_27]: They've been great about posting the materials, but they are also set up as full-size posters.

218
00:22:21,686 --> 00:22:25,749
[SPEAKER_27]: So either we can print them out and give them to the city or they can print them out.

219
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:29,929
[SPEAKER_27]: to be available for people to see.

220
00:22:30,069 --> 00:22:36,414
[SPEAKER_27]: So although it looks small on the slide, they are actually 24 by 36 poster size.

221
00:22:39,136 --> 00:22:44,260
[SPEAKER_14]: You and I think alike, Emily, because I just dropped a link to the presentation in the meeting chat.

222
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:52,306
[SPEAKER_14]: So if anybody wants to zoom in a little bit extra on those tables, which I know I am going to do, that link is in the chat.

223
00:22:54,472 --> 00:23:03,263
[SPEAKER_07]: And later I can go through the if anyone asked I can go through the tables, so we can see it with a little bit of more high quality image.

224
00:23:06,378 --> 00:23:11,101
[SPEAKER_07]: I will continue now with the recommended changes.

225
00:23:11,321 --> 00:23:13,822
[SPEAKER_07]: As I said, we can go through the draft.

226
00:23:13,942 --> 00:23:18,005
[SPEAKER_07]: If anyone asks for, we have the draft, we can go through all the changes.

227
00:23:18,785 --> 00:23:30,071
[SPEAKER_07]: Here are only the ones that we are recommended from the version that was referred from the city council to the suggestions that we have for the

228
00:23:31,392 --> 00:23:33,474
[SPEAKER_07]: For the city board to consider.

229
00:23:34,535 --> 00:23:36,937
[SPEAKER_07]: So, the 1st thing is to update the draft.

230
00:23:37,017 --> 00:23:41,220
[SPEAKER_07]: It was updated to exclude all the references to the residential districts.

231
00:23:42,101 --> 00:23:47,946
[SPEAKER_07]: Since we are not going to vote on that on those residential areas.

232
00:23:49,526 --> 00:24:04,972
[SPEAKER_07]: Then the second will be to update the section 94.3.2 and these are the table of use regulations and so we have several modifications and so we have all the different uses that are from the table of uses.

233
00:24:05,372 --> 00:24:07,113
[SPEAKER_07]: I will go through them because they are not a lot.

234
00:24:07,653 --> 00:24:11,337
[SPEAKER_07]: So A4 is the three-unit dwelling detached.

235
00:24:11,957 --> 00:24:18,603
[SPEAKER_07]: This will be also added by right to the MX1B, and it's the only one that has changed.

236
00:24:18,803 --> 00:24:22,807
[SPEAKER_07]: The other districts do not allow a three-unit dwelling.

237
00:24:23,288 --> 00:24:32,836
[SPEAKER_07]: The MX1B is the lowest from all the four that we have seen, so we think that adding that smaller scale would be

238
00:24:33,997 --> 00:24:37,620
[SPEAKER_07]: would be good for this to show a little bit of that diversity in skills.

239
00:24:39,041 --> 00:24:44,604
[SPEAKER_07]: Then we have 8.5, that is the multiplex, that building that holds from four to six buildings.

240
00:24:45,185 --> 00:24:52,249
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, this is also by right and it's going to be by right for MX1B and as well for MX2A.

241
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:57,373
[SPEAKER_07]: In 2B and in 3A won't be allowed.

242
00:24:59,384 --> 00:25:01,406
[SPEAKER_07]: Then we also have the townhouse.

243
00:25:01,546 --> 00:25:13,413
[SPEAKER_07]: In this case, again, depending on the units that we allow, on the minimum units that we allow in the different districts, we would allow a townhouse with those minimums.

244
00:25:13,893 --> 00:25:26,081
[SPEAKER_07]: In the MX1B, a minimum townhouse of three units would be allowed, which is the minimum for a townhouse, and the MX2A would be allowed a four-unit townhouse.

245
00:25:27,882 --> 00:25:49,417
[SPEAKER_07]: Then we have added the I.6 and this is municipal parking area or garage as a principal use and this is not allowed in MX1B and MX2A but will be allowed by right in more intense districts MX2B and MX3A.

246
00:25:49,958 --> 00:25:52,340
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a new use that we are adding to the table.

247
00:25:53,821 --> 00:25:58,224
[SPEAKER_07]: Then we have new numbering because we added this municipal parking.

248
00:25:58,644 --> 00:26:05,388
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to renumber the open storage, moving of land, radio and television tower and solar energy system.

249
00:26:05,428 --> 00:26:06,789
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the only thing that changes.

250
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:11,953
[SPEAKER_07]: There is no added or change in the by right or allowed or not allowed.

251
00:26:13,433 --> 00:26:24,116
[SPEAKER_07]: Then we added a footnote referencing K1 accessory dwelling units, which states that subject to change for the revision of the new ADU ordinance.

252
00:26:24,776 --> 00:26:35,939
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, as we haven't gone through residential ADU, we don't feel comfortable in placing something that hasn't been updated and approved.

253
00:26:35,999 --> 00:26:39,680
[SPEAKER_07]: We want to wait until that is approved and then this will change

254
00:26:40,283 --> 00:26:46,532
[SPEAKER_07]: and add those protected ADU uses, local ADUs and by special permit ADU.

255
00:26:49,103 --> 00:26:58,308
[SPEAKER_07]: Then we have some recommendations for the table of dimensional requirements and is all the highlighted in yellow that you will see here.

256
00:26:59,008 --> 00:27:03,290
[SPEAKER_07]: For the lot area square footage, we have MX2B and MX3A.

257
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:12,135
[SPEAKER_07]: This was answering to a comment that we got in the last city board meeting.

258
00:27:13,696 --> 00:27:18,021
[SPEAKER_07]: which state that 5,000 was too big for people that wanted to do something.

259
00:27:19,003 --> 00:27:23,468
[SPEAKER_07]: So we checked the areas, how many were from 3,000 to 4,000, and we had a few from 4,000 to 5,000.

260
00:27:23,568 --> 00:27:25,050
[SPEAKER_07]: So we lowered into 4,000.

261
00:27:32,438 --> 00:27:49,892
[SPEAKER_07]: So, more will be conforming and we would be able to have something with all the requirements in a 4000, we cannot have very tall buildings, but we could have some 2 layers of commercial, you know, so we would have that info possibility.

262
00:27:51,333 --> 00:27:53,075
[SPEAKER_07]: instead of having a vacant land.

263
00:27:54,276 --> 00:28:06,289
[SPEAKER_07]: Then we have the frontage, we reduce as well the mixed 3A to 40% and then the active ground floor it's now reduced to 60%.

264
00:28:09,612 --> 00:28:21,988
[SPEAKER_07]: Since a lot of the lots are smaller with small frontage, so we have the entrance to a garage or parking, then we need that active ground floor gets reduced.

265
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:24,672
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we have

266
00:28:25,192 --> 00:28:29,155
[SPEAKER_07]: Setbacks, this was also from a comment for historic buildings.

267
00:28:29,555 --> 00:28:47,788
[SPEAKER_07]: We had a front minimum of setback of three, from three to 20, so we have changed that so that the historic buildings, so that doesn't fit as it was like zipper, I think she described it, so that it's more aligned.

268
00:28:48,369 --> 00:28:50,911
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't mind to have that zero setback.

269
00:28:52,151 --> 00:28:54,212
[SPEAKER_07]: Then the rear setback, we changed it to zero.

270
00:28:54,292 --> 00:29:14,917
[SPEAKER_07]: We also had some comments on that end, but we do have a protection that whenever any of these districts abuts a residential district, we have a 10-foot rear and side setback so that it protects the residential neighbors.

271
00:29:17,808 --> 00:29:22,972
[SPEAKER_07]: Then we have the updated, we continue with the dimensions in this case is the stormwater and landscape.

272
00:29:23,893 --> 00:29:30,398
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a building coverage of, we updated to 90% on the more intense ones.

273
00:29:30,538 --> 00:29:33,340
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's MX2B and MX3A.

274
00:29:34,201 --> 00:29:34,961
[SPEAKER_07]: And we have the

275
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:37,251
[SPEAKER_07]: open space permeable.

276
00:29:37,271 --> 00:29:38,992
[SPEAKER_07]: So we had now two.

277
00:29:39,193 --> 00:29:48,280
[SPEAKER_07]: One comes from Salem corridor and Mystic Avenue corridor where we use permeable open space.

278
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:49,981
[SPEAKER_07]: Now we're using pervious.

279
00:29:50,101 --> 00:29:53,164
[SPEAKER_07]: That is a more general definition.

280
00:29:53,584 --> 00:29:59,709
[SPEAKER_07]: So we want to continue with the pervious and that's why we are cleaning a little bit that remnant from the other corridors.

281
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:04,553
[SPEAKER_07]: That will be fixed also at the end of the process when we do a cleanup.

282
00:30:05,433 --> 00:30:10,236
[SPEAKER_07]: And those are reduced to 10% in MX2B and MX3A.

283
00:30:12,158 --> 00:30:13,098
[SPEAKER_07]: We have green score.

284
00:30:13,118 --> 00:30:18,161
[SPEAKER_07]: So whenever the project has a bigger impact, has to go through green score.

285
00:30:19,042 --> 00:30:20,783
[SPEAKER_07]: So that is to be clear.

286
00:30:21,684 --> 00:30:25,486
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we have open space landscape that also changes to 15% and 10%.

287
00:30:25,526 --> 00:30:27,447
[SPEAKER_07]: So these are changes from the previous.

288
00:30:32,021 --> 00:30:33,802
[SPEAKER_07]: Then we have updated definitions.

289
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:36,323
[SPEAKER_07]: We want to add building coverage.

290
00:30:36,563 --> 00:30:51,169
[SPEAKER_07]: The current Medford, what it has is lot coverage, but the lot coverage actually does not take into account any accessory buildings, accessory structures,

291
00:30:52,769 --> 00:30:54,550
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's only the principal building.

292
00:30:55,270 --> 00:31:06,294
[SPEAKER_07]: So we want to update that the maximum area of a lot that is permitted to be covered by the combination of the principal buildings, accessory buildings, and accessory structures.

293
00:31:06,814 --> 00:31:15,257
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the building coverage of the structure is measured from the outside of the exterior walls and the ground story, including covered porches and other building components.

294
00:31:16,077 --> 00:31:26,224
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is the one that we would like to recommend as the new definition and new dimensional standard.

295
00:31:27,605 --> 00:31:30,647
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we have the section applicability.

296
00:31:31,167 --> 00:31:43,977
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, we need to exclude the residential districts from the definition and description of both areas, of both squares.

297
00:31:44,217 --> 00:31:49,901
[SPEAKER_07]: Then we change the district name of Mixed Use 1 to Mixed Use 1B.

298
00:31:49,921 --> 00:31:54,385
[SPEAKER_07]: There is a difference between, for example, the Mixed Use 1 that we had in Salem,

299
00:31:54,985 --> 00:31:57,647
[SPEAKER_07]: and the mixed-use that we are proposing now.

300
00:31:58,848 --> 00:32:01,770
[SPEAKER_07]: They are quite different, so that's why we want to bring the new name.

301
00:32:02,391 --> 00:32:15,481
[SPEAKER_07]: Then we would have mixed-use 3 to go to mixed-use 3a, since in Mystic we have another 3, which is even more intense, and so that will be 3b in the future.

302
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:26,484
[SPEAKER_07]: Then we go to dimensional requirements and waivers section 94-9.x.3.

303
00:32:26,564 --> 00:32:34,207
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we have some recommendations and what you see that is changing is what I have highlighted in yellow.

304
00:32:34,708 --> 00:32:43,051
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes it's just a way of making it more clear in the way it's written.

305
00:32:43,131 --> 00:32:46,273
[SPEAKER_07]: We just change for the front setbacks.

306
00:32:46,793 --> 00:32:53,596
[SPEAKER_07]: the language of a maximum setback of 20 feet that is allowed for the purpose of creating an active public plaza.

307
00:32:54,436 --> 00:32:56,577
[SPEAKER_07]: That language is changed.

308
00:32:57,398 --> 00:33:04,601
[SPEAKER_07]: Then there were some districts that were bringing something from a different.

309
00:33:04,961 --> 00:33:08,823
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a commercial district here, so it's changed to MX3.

310
00:33:08,903 --> 00:33:10,644
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't have commercial districts here.

311
00:33:11,464 --> 00:33:21,768
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, then we don't know exactly because we don't have the residential districts yet instead of going the explaining which residential districts and then change it.

312
00:33:21,788 --> 00:33:27,291
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, we just generically call that anything that abuts that residential district.

313
00:33:28,111 --> 00:33:29,893
[SPEAKER_07]: The height setback is required.

314
00:33:29,913 --> 00:33:46,286
[SPEAKER_07]: It was very specific to Salem and Mystic, so in here we had to change it to the four-floor and above, since now we have higher buildings than six stories.

315
00:33:48,969 --> 00:33:54,031
[SPEAKER_07]: For the ground floor active frontage, we changed the definition of active uses.

316
00:33:54,672 --> 00:33:56,853
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we use this as follows.

317
00:33:57,013 --> 00:34:12,720
[SPEAKER_07]: Active uses include retail, restaurant, cafes, personal services, other active commercial uses, publicly accessible office or residential lobbies, and active building amenities spaces, example, gym, residential, common space.

318
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:31,628
[SPEAKER_07]: Where active commercial uses are not feasible, the following may be substitute, a residential stoop, a setback of green, open space, or a public space with seating, public art, such a mural or sculpture, or another use that provides an engaging ground floor.

319
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:40,567
[SPEAKER_07]: Then we wanted to also bring here the daylight minimum standards that we are working on.

320
00:34:41,687 --> 00:34:51,689
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not yet fully drawn, but we wanted to introduce and just tell the community that will be defined.

321
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:55,030
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just a little bit more complex, needs time.

322
00:34:55,810 --> 00:34:58,011
[SPEAKER_07]: We wanted to make it well.

323
00:34:58,671 --> 00:35:02,512
[SPEAKER_07]: We just wanted to introduce it and say that we are working on it.

324
00:35:04,332 --> 00:35:05,473
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is the end.

325
00:35:05,873 --> 00:35:08,034
[SPEAKER_07]: These are all the recommended changes that we have.

326
00:35:09,294 --> 00:35:20,057
[SPEAKER_07]: If there is any question, if you want me to go through any of the development standards or look into the different sections that we have prepared before, just let me know.

327
00:35:20,077 --> 00:35:21,818
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to stop here.

328
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:29,781
[SPEAKER_14]: Great, thank you for that.

329
00:35:30,421 --> 00:35:32,942
[SPEAKER_14]: I really enjoyed the visual, the table.

330
00:35:33,362 --> 00:35:40,704
[SPEAKER_14]: I think I mentioned it as you were doing it, the table that kind of compares all the different districts and then all their features.

331
00:35:40,764 --> 00:35:45,865
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's something maybe we as a board want to go back to and really dig into.

332
00:35:47,585 --> 00:35:50,666
[SPEAKER_14]: So the next thing that we have is board discussion.

333
00:35:50,686 --> 00:35:55,087
[SPEAKER_14]: And I have a couple of questions for Paola and Emily.

334
00:35:55,107 --> 00:35:57,588
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see.

335
00:36:01,269 --> 00:36:05,370
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess I just have one to start off with, and then I want to kind of send it off to the rest of the board.

336
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:13,573
[SPEAKER_14]: So for the ground floor active frontage, I noticed that you mentioned publicly accessible lobbies.

337
00:36:14,513 --> 00:36:20,395
[SPEAKER_14]: I've read some stuff lately about a proliferation of banks being

338
00:36:22,482 --> 00:36:25,963
[SPEAKER_14]: occupying first floor spaces and some of our most dynamic squares.

339
00:36:26,043 --> 00:36:50,108
[SPEAKER_14]: I know we obviously cannot prevent specific uses, but is there a way that, you know, we can look for active uses that are active for longer than just a workday that kind of give us like a vibrant nightlife and provide services for residents outside of, you know, Monday through Friday, nine to five.

340
00:36:53,288 --> 00:36:57,170
[SPEAKER_27]: I'll jump on that and then Paula, feel free to fill in as well.

341
00:36:58,451 --> 00:37:14,720
[SPEAKER_27]: The act of ground floor is a really tricky definition to parse in some ways, because I think all of us who have been working in this field have heard of places that have required ground floor commercial that hasn't been filled.

342
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:17,642
[SPEAKER_27]: And so the way we try and think about it now is,

343
00:37:18,582 --> 00:37:27,666
[SPEAKER_27]: What is, to your point, Madam Chair, what's going to draw people at different times of the day and increase that foot traffic?

344
00:37:27,706 --> 00:37:38,150
[SPEAKER_27]: So a lot of places, this has been slightly amended, but this has actually come from another Massachusetts city that we've been working with, where they've expanded the definition of active use.

345
00:37:39,631 --> 00:38:01,331
[SPEAKER_27]: It's interesting you're bringing up the bank because of course we've always thought of banks as being static places, but a lot of banks are starting, I know of one for example, and I think it's in Brookline, and I've seen them in other places, where the bank has a cafe, they have a co-working space as part of their ground floor lobby because they're trying

346
00:38:01,771 --> 00:38:03,874
[SPEAKER_27]: to attract a different level of customers.

347
00:38:04,094 --> 00:38:19,555
[SPEAKER_27]: So I think it's important with this idea of we're requiring a certain percentage of ground floor active frontage, but we need to be flexible about what counts as ground floor active.

348
00:38:20,042 --> 00:38:37,249
[SPEAKER_27]: So I agree with you, the ideal is something that encourages activity for more than just nine to five, but how we get there and how we define that so that it's flexible, not just for now, but 10, 15, 20 years from now is a little bit of a challenge.

349
00:38:37,309 --> 00:38:43,712
[SPEAKER_27]: So I'd love to hear more from you board members and from the public of other ways we could also think about this.

350
00:38:43,732 --> 00:38:47,253
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm curious what precedents are out there

351
00:38:49,831 --> 00:38:50,298
[SPEAKER_14]: around.

352
00:38:52,942 --> 00:38:56,023
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, more consistent activation at different times of the day.

353
00:38:56,043 --> 00:39:12,326
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, what popped into my head was, you know, can we, can we require that, you know, a business is open X number of hours or, you know, X number of evenings, you know, per week, but, you know, we don't want to mandate how businesses do their business.

354
00:39:12,386 --> 00:39:15,307
[SPEAKER_14]: So that feels like we're getting into kind of tricky territory.

355
00:39:15,327 --> 00:39:21,728
[SPEAKER_14]: I see Ari's hand, curious if they have any other ideas or any other questions.

356
00:39:23,907 --> 00:39:29,613
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so I'll start with commentary on what we were just talking about and then the question I had.

357
00:39:30,997 --> 00:39:37,680
[SPEAKER_10]: I agree that the banks are a very good example, especially for Medford Square.

358
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:45,742
[SPEAKER_10]: I have yet to see someone express excitement about Chase moving into the old vault space.

359
00:39:45,762 --> 00:39:51,404
[SPEAKER_10]: I know there's nothing we can do about it, but I think it is a problem for our public squares.

360
00:39:51,424 --> 00:39:57,907
[SPEAKER_10]: I am very cautious about mandating the specific hours because when I think about a space like that,

361
00:39:59,165 --> 00:40:00,986
[SPEAKER_10]: we would love a daycare there.

362
00:40:01,666 --> 00:40:08,068
[SPEAKER_10]: I know it's a loss to the square that the one next to Abisuya is moving, although they did find a new church.

363
00:40:08,928 --> 00:40:12,029
[SPEAKER_10]: They by definition just have very limited hours.

364
00:40:12,409 --> 00:40:25,353
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think that's going to be the tool we want to use, but big fan of thinking creatively about this and taking in public comment to think about how we can do this.

365
00:40:26,153 --> 00:40:28,794
[SPEAKER_10]: The question I had was just maybe like

366
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:38,486
[SPEAKER_10]: 5 extra sentences about the daylight thing kind of obviously it's not created, but like, what is the broad shape that you're trying to get wording for?

367
00:40:39,087 --> 00:40:39,368
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

368
00:40:43,132 --> 00:40:46,854
[SPEAKER_07]: Madam, if I may, yeah, I can jump into that.

369
00:40:46,874 --> 00:40:50,935
[SPEAKER_07]: 1 thing that we were working also for the.

370
00:40:51,496 --> 00:40:54,157
[SPEAKER_07]: Question that was the precedent question, if I just can.

371
00:40:55,657 --> 00:40:57,318
[SPEAKER_07]: Best answer a little bit more.

372
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:00,960
[SPEAKER_07]: We have some in the incentive zoning, some.

373
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,381
[SPEAKER_07]: Incentives for local.

374
00:41:06,922 --> 00:41:24,111
[SPEAKER_07]: commerce, local business so that they can get, if they rent it or sell it to a local business, they can have some incentives there to move that more local economy.

375
00:41:24,832 --> 00:41:27,313
[SPEAKER_07]: Then there's also design guidelines.

376
00:41:27,373 --> 00:41:31,315
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes it's not about that we're not working on that.

377
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:35,598
[SPEAKER_07]: That's for the future, but just to keep in mind,

378
00:41:36,819 --> 00:41:56,917
[SPEAKER_07]: sometimes it's not as much of what business is but that is transparent enough and that there is a connection between the outside and the inside and there is an exchange of people walking in by a lot of times the banks have or banks or real estate office where they have

379
00:41:57,377 --> 00:42:04,003
[SPEAKER_07]: all the windows completely covered and you cannot see really into the office, that doesn't create a very active.

380
00:42:04,064 --> 00:42:15,154
[SPEAKER_07]: So having certain standards for design guidelines that open that transparency makes it, even though it's not a super active intense business, but that at least there is some kind of transparency.

381
00:42:15,214 --> 00:42:19,278
[SPEAKER_07]: So that would be another way of at least activate a little bit more.

382
00:42:20,528 --> 00:42:22,070
[SPEAKER_07]: about the daylight now.

383
00:42:23,111 --> 00:42:25,813
[SPEAKER_07]: So we are looking into different options.

384
00:42:27,014 --> 00:42:40,405
[SPEAKER_07]: One that I find very interesting is more about, so the sun study, it's never static, it's very dynamic.

385
00:42:40,465 --> 00:42:47,010
[SPEAKER_07]: So you need a very broad study, not only for a day, but for the year.

386
00:42:47,831 --> 00:42:48,771
[SPEAKER_07]: And so to have,

387
00:42:49,872 --> 00:42:57,758
[SPEAKER_07]: At least we're looking into finding the months that are the worst case scenario months.

388
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:09,766
[SPEAKER_07]: Then from that, having a certain amount of hours a day in those months that are protected from your neighbors.

389
00:43:09,806 --> 00:43:18,413
[SPEAKER_07]: The impact that these new developments need to study is how much they are going to impact the residential neighbors.

390
00:43:19,053 --> 00:43:40,118
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we will, there are many different ways to do this, but that is the one that I think worked best and it's more realistic and also gives a lot of flexibility for the architecture, how that design could help instead of being a static block, if they start to play with the form.

391
00:43:40,638 --> 00:43:50,483
[SPEAKER_07]: they can get those minimum hours a day protected without compromising too much the development of the building.

392
00:43:50,543 --> 00:44:07,672
[SPEAKER_07]: So that is, I think, the one that we're exploring the most, but it needs to be, it's not well-established in the US, so we want to get it right and also look in nationally other strategies that might be interesting.

393
00:44:09,159 --> 00:44:24,529
[SPEAKER_27]: And just to piggyback on that, I think what we're all talking about is how do we set standards for certain things, certain results, certain conditions that we want to have happen, but then it's up to the applicant with an actual project to come forward.

394
00:44:24,549 --> 00:44:36,576
[SPEAKER_27]: So for example, on the daylight, the zoning was set the standard, the applicant would come before the CD board for either a site plan review or a special permit, and they would have to do a study at that point.

395
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,462
[SPEAKER_27]: to prove that they met the requirements.

396
00:44:40,262 --> 00:44:53,050
[SPEAKER_27]: And so getting the standards right is critical and understanding how somebody would be able to prove that they met those conditions as part of setting the standards.

397
00:44:54,513 --> 00:45:05,736
[SPEAKER_27]: I think there was a trend a few years back for noise ordinances and other ordinances where the ability to measure, it's like, okay, we can have the standard, but how do you measure it?

398
00:45:05,756 --> 00:45:10,937
[SPEAKER_27]: The ability to measure wasn't something that was practical or cost-effective.

399
00:45:10,997 --> 00:45:18,459
[SPEAKER_27]: And so we want to make sure that we get it right so that somebody comes in front of the board, you all know what's being measured and why and how.

400
00:45:20,229 --> 00:45:29,496
[SPEAKER_07]: And also, these are studies that are easy to do for an architecture office that basically every program right now does it in this way.

401
00:45:30,557 --> 00:45:35,680
[SPEAKER_07]: So there is no extra cost that they have to call to an engineering firm to do it.

402
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:39,003
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just very easy to do with the programs that we have right now.

403
00:45:41,104 --> 00:45:41,825
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks, both of you.

404
00:45:49,453 --> 00:45:50,253
[SPEAKER_06]: I see Alicia's hand.

405
00:45:52,234 --> 00:45:54,135
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'll defer to Ben.

406
00:45:54,856 --> 00:46:04,141
[SPEAKER_06]: When the board has finished commenting, I actually have a couple of questions and thoughts that I just wanted to make sure the board heard and considered too.

407
00:46:04,161 --> 00:46:06,262
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, thank you.

408
00:46:08,003 --> 00:46:08,663
[SPEAKER_13]: Board member Ben.

409
00:46:10,504 --> 00:46:12,005
[SPEAKER_17]: Hi, thank you, Emily.

410
00:46:13,546 --> 00:46:17,808
[SPEAKER_17]: I have a couple of different categories of feedback, I guess.

411
00:46:19,032 --> 00:46:29,562
[SPEAKER_17]: The first is that the changes to terminology and definitions are quite hard to follow, even for me on the CDB.

412
00:46:30,803 --> 00:46:34,967
[SPEAKER_17]: And so I imagine, and this is a bit of feedback that we've had from the public repeatedly.

413
00:46:35,987 --> 00:46:40,271
[SPEAKER_17]: So for example, MX1 in April is now MX1B in June.

414
00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:54,100
[SPEAKER_17]: I would argue that when we're distributing materials to the public or presenting in a public forum like this, that we should actually just write the words out because it's very hard to keep track of all the different acronyms.

415
00:46:54,200 --> 00:47:06,451
[SPEAKER_17]: So I don't want to nitpick, but there were several slides with tables with MX1B and 2A and somebody, you know, in the community trying to keep up with that.

416
00:47:06,572 --> 00:47:08,453
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just overwhelming, frankly.

417
00:47:09,718 --> 00:47:11,699
[SPEAKER_17]: And I know everybody's, everybody's working hard.

418
00:47:11,719 --> 00:47:20,043
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's a commentary just on sort of simplification, not, you know, not anybody needing to do a better job or anything.

419
00:47:20,543 --> 00:47:21,744
[SPEAKER_17]: So I just want to be clear about that.

420
00:47:22,724 --> 00:47:26,746
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think the term... Can you give us the ambiguity now before you go further on those?

421
00:47:27,887 --> 00:47:29,208
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't, I don't need it now.

422
00:47:29,448 --> 00:47:31,809
[SPEAKER_17]: I think I, I think I'm, I think I'm caught up.

423
00:47:32,735 --> 00:47:38,421
[SPEAKER_17]: But I think it leads into another point, which is around the timing of distribution of materials, right?

424
00:47:38,521 --> 00:47:52,254
[SPEAKER_17]: And so in the preparation for tonight's meeting, you know, watched prior videos, reviewed prior presentations, looked at all the materials that were available in our file shares.

425
00:47:52,875 --> 00:47:55,898
[SPEAKER_17]: And even now, in the public file shares,

426
00:47:58,015 --> 00:48:04,717
[SPEAKER_17]: the presentations that are being reviewed tonight weren't uploaded until less than an hour before the meeting, right?

427
00:48:04,757 --> 00:48:17,222
[SPEAKER_17]: And I would put forward that with everything that everybody has on their plate, people's clear passion for this topic and the future of this city, that we should give the public time to digest.

428
00:48:17,262 --> 00:48:19,603
[SPEAKER_17]: And if that means that we need more time, then so be it.

429
00:48:20,143 --> 00:48:25,845
[SPEAKER_17]: These are important decisions, but uploading the presentation less than an hour before the public hearing,

430
00:48:27,110 --> 00:48:35,874
[SPEAKER_17]: just people's heads are spinning and it's hard to have any meaningful feedback when you're just like trying to make sure that you understand what's been put in front of you.

431
00:48:35,914 --> 00:48:51,201
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think that we should consider, for example, public distribution of presentations several days in advance with some sort of notification from the city that materials are available for review and so that the public comment and the dialogue can be

432
00:48:52,035 --> 00:48:58,879
[SPEAKER_17]: grounded on people having had a chance to digest it versus trying to digest it in a meeting like this and provide feedback.

433
00:48:59,419 --> 00:49:01,400
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that's just a lot to ask of people.

434
00:49:03,361 --> 00:49:07,143
[SPEAKER_17]: And then I do wanna clarify, because again, this changed for tonight's meeting.

435
00:49:08,344 --> 00:49:19,730
[SPEAKER_17]: Tonight, we're talking about the squares with the updated boundaries, not the residential areas, because there are certain corners of Governors Ave,

436
00:49:20,971 --> 00:49:28,375
[SPEAKER_17]: Ashland Street, which is where I live, Oakland Street, where those lines have moved since the last meeting.

437
00:49:28,435 --> 00:49:32,037
[SPEAKER_17]: So can somebody please clarify exactly what's being discussed tonight?

438
00:49:32,097 --> 00:49:35,239
[SPEAKER_17]: I believe it's after we've kind of moved the lines.

439
00:49:36,099 --> 00:49:37,080
[SPEAKER_17]: Is that true?

440
00:49:37,482 --> 00:49:38,483
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, Emily.

441
00:49:38,503 --> 00:49:40,544
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, just just to be super clear.

442
00:49:40,584 --> 00:49:43,546
[SPEAKER_14]: This is not something that has been confirmed.

443
00:49:43,747 --> 00:49:59,378
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a recommendation that we as a board can discuss to see, you know, do we think it makes more sense to restrict that boundary for West Medford Medford Square and only talk about these commercially focused zones?

444
00:50:00,198 --> 00:50:04,821
[SPEAKER_14]: so that we're not conflating them with the residential.

445
00:50:05,161 --> 00:50:08,903
[SPEAKER_14]: But I'll pass it to Emily just to double confirm.

446
00:50:09,784 --> 00:50:10,124
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes.

447
00:50:10,644 --> 00:50:14,626
[SPEAKER_27]: So a couple of things, and thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you, Ben.

448
00:50:14,987 --> 00:50:17,428
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm going to work my way backwards.

449
00:50:18,389 --> 00:50:29,435
[SPEAKER_27]: So for tonight, initially, the squares came, were recommended to the CD board after the residential districts were recommended to the CD board.

450
00:50:30,111 --> 00:50:44,594
[SPEAKER_27]: So the thought was that the small areas of the squares that were the same as the other residential districts, those residential districts would have gone through the process and so we could keep them.

451
00:50:44,634 --> 00:50:55,437
[SPEAKER_27]: But now the squares are perhaps, we don't know because it depends on the discussion today, but there's a possibility that they could happen, they could be voted back to the city council.

452
00:50:57,005 --> 00:51:02,447
[SPEAKER_27]: prior to the residential because the residential path as of last week has now slowed down.

453
00:51:03,127 --> 00:51:15,352
[SPEAKER_27]: And so we didn't want the city board, we didn't want, we don't want the city board and we didn't want the city council to be ahead of the rest of the residential district conversation.

454
00:51:15,392 --> 00:51:21,954
[SPEAKER_27]: So our recommendation and Chair Hedeman is absolutely spot on when she says all of these are recommendations.

455
00:51:22,054 --> 00:51:23,695
[SPEAKER_27]: Our recommendation is let's pull

456
00:51:24,175 --> 00:51:32,919
[SPEAKER_27]: the neighborhood residential districts out of the discussions of the square so we don't inadvertently get ourselves cross-tied on this.

457
00:51:33,239 --> 00:51:34,320
[SPEAKER_27]: Same thing with the ADUs.

458
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:39,062
[SPEAKER_27]: The ADUs are now part of the residential discussion that's been slowed down.

459
00:51:39,122 --> 00:51:45,565
[SPEAKER_27]: We can't pass the ADUs as shown because we would then be ahead of ourselves.

460
00:51:45,585 --> 00:51:46,406
[SPEAKER_27]: So that's part of it.

461
00:51:47,383 --> 00:52:05,221
[SPEAKER_27]: That also, in many ways, feeds into the discussion of when materials are getting to you, because we've been trying to respond to public comment on several different topics, and we've been having about a public meeting with you a week, whether it's been a

462
00:52:06,462 --> 00:52:14,606
[SPEAKER_27]: a public listening session or community development board meeting or a planning and permitting committee meeting.

463
00:52:15,046 --> 00:52:17,527
[SPEAKER_27]: In a couple of cases, we've had two meetings a week.

464
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:22,490
[SPEAKER_27]: We are working pretty much as fast as we can to meet the meeting schedule.

465
00:52:25,493 --> 00:52:27,614
[SPEAKER_27]: And, you know, that is what it is.

466
00:52:27,634 --> 00:52:29,035
[SPEAKER_27]: That's what we do as consultants.

467
00:52:29,155 --> 00:52:34,038
[SPEAKER_27]: So we're not happy that we're not getting it to you further in advance.

468
00:52:34,118 --> 00:52:36,039
[SPEAKER_27]: We would like to be a little bit further in advance.

469
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:38,660
[SPEAKER_27]: And maybe the summer is- Emily, your audio is going out a little bit.

470
00:52:39,041 --> 00:52:39,261
[SPEAKER_27]: Sorry.

471
00:52:39,361 --> 00:52:44,804
[SPEAKER_27]: And maybe the summer is an opportunity for us to catch up to that so we can get it in advance.

472
00:52:45,404 --> 00:52:46,205
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah.

473
00:52:46,225 --> 00:52:52,328
[SPEAKER_27]: So there's an apology from me to all of you that they haven't been as fast, but we have been working as fast as we can.

474
00:52:53,658 --> 00:52:56,341
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you so much for the clarifications, Emily.

475
00:52:56,461 --> 00:53:04,388
[SPEAKER_17]: And just to be clear, like totally recognize everybody's working as hard as they can, uploading materials as quickly as they can.

476
00:53:05,589 --> 00:53:11,173
[SPEAKER_17]: It's more so, you know, the reasonableness of the timing for everybody to do a comprehensive job.

477
00:53:11,534 --> 00:53:15,577
[SPEAKER_17]: And put me, now that you've clarified, I appreciate that.

478
00:53:16,038 --> 00:53:19,220
[SPEAKER_17]: I do think it's good to separate

479
00:53:19,928 --> 00:53:22,389
[SPEAKER_17]: neighborhood residential from the squares.

480
00:53:22,630 --> 00:53:29,193
[SPEAKER_17]: I like the redrawn lines that remove some of the residential properties from the Medford Square conversation, for example.

481
00:53:31,154 --> 00:53:32,435
[SPEAKER_17]: I would recommend that

482
00:53:33,523 --> 00:53:40,448
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, some of the materials that were just presented and that are in the public folders now, I think it presents an opportunity.

483
00:53:40,708 --> 00:53:44,350
[SPEAKER_17]: By doing this, it gives us an opportunity for simplification of the materials.

484
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:50,255
[SPEAKER_17]: So, for example, a lot of the maps, while they are focused on the squares,

485
00:53:51,015 --> 00:54:01,885
[SPEAKER_17]: they continue to show the residential neighborhoods, and they're all color coded, and you just run into a situation where there's too many colors, and they're too closely aligned, and it makes the maps kind of harder to read.

486
00:54:01,925 --> 00:54:04,728
[SPEAKER_17]: So I would posit that for the squares, we should just

487
00:54:05,502 --> 00:54:12,127
[SPEAKER_17]: gray out the whole neighborhood residential areas and use nice, bright, easily distinguishable colors for the different areas in the square.

488
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:16,771
[SPEAKER_17]: So totally recognize the pace that we're moving and the changes.

489
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:21,314
[SPEAKER_17]: And I do appreciate Ennis Associates' responsiveness to public comments.

490
00:54:22,375 --> 00:54:23,516
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll be quiet here in just a minute.

491
00:54:23,536 --> 00:54:24,377
[SPEAKER_17]: I have one more thing.

492
00:54:25,438 --> 00:54:28,820
[SPEAKER_17]: And this also I think is in line with what we've heard from the public.

493
00:54:29,321 --> 00:54:30,041
[SPEAKER_17]: There happens to be,

494
00:54:31,367 --> 00:54:43,238
[SPEAKER_17]: in one of the areas that's designated as mixed-use with like a five-story limit, I forget which mixed-use category it is, is a National Grid substation, right?

495
00:54:43,258 --> 00:54:48,723
[SPEAKER_17]: It's on Salem Street, kind of right by the bus stop there across from City Hall.

496
00:54:49,484 --> 00:54:56,350
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm curious, you know, I think we should, I feel uneducated and I think

497
00:54:56,700 --> 00:55:07,245
[SPEAKER_17]: by extension, we can assume that most of the public would benefit from some education around what does this mean for the city's infrastructure, specifically power, sewer, right?

498
00:55:07,325 --> 00:55:12,828
[SPEAKER_17]: Does this mean that National Grid can sell that building and there's going to be a five-story apartment building put there?

499
00:55:12,948 --> 00:55:17,030
[SPEAKER_17]: If so, what are the implications for the city's electric distribution?

500
00:55:17,771 --> 00:55:25,735
[SPEAKER_17]: So I don't know sort of who owns that piece of it, but I do think that there should be a public dialogue around

501
00:55:26,623 --> 00:55:41,913
[SPEAKER_17]: the infrastructure and its ability to support this increased density, increased commercial usage, that little substation on Salem Street is kind of a good case study for the type of thing that I imagine people are eager to hear about.

502
00:55:43,314 --> 00:55:44,035
[SPEAKER_17]: I took a lot of time.

503
00:55:44,235 --> 00:55:45,276
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for listening to me.

504
00:55:46,336 --> 00:55:46,877
[SPEAKER_17]: Appreciate it.

505
00:55:49,559 --> 00:55:50,659
[SPEAKER_14]: It's all good time, Ben.

506
00:55:52,461 --> 00:55:52,661
[SPEAKER_14]: And I,

507
00:55:54,987 --> 00:55:56,807
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to hand it off to Alicia.

508
00:55:56,827 --> 00:55:59,108
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, we were just talking about this earlier.

509
00:55:59,188 --> 00:56:01,068
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's a perfect question.

510
00:56:02,669 --> 00:56:05,489
[SPEAKER_06]: So actually, I'm going to answer that in two ways.

511
00:56:06,810 --> 00:56:09,590
[SPEAKER_06]: And one is that they're two completely separate questions.

512
00:56:10,090 --> 00:56:12,791
[SPEAKER_06]: So can you hear let me move the mic closer to me.

513
00:56:13,251 --> 00:56:14,471
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you Okay, is that better?

514
00:56:15,051 --> 00:56:16,292
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you guys hear me on the zoom?

515
00:56:16,592 --> 00:56:17,512
[SPEAKER_06]: And does that make a difference?

516
00:56:17,532 --> 00:56:17,812
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

517
00:56:18,272 --> 00:56:18,432
[SPEAKER_06]: question.

518
00:56:18,452 --> 00:56:19,713
[SPEAKER_06]: Um so let me answer that.

519
00:56:19,773 --> 00:56:22,134
[SPEAKER_06]: And there are two completely separate questions here.

520
00:56:22,754 --> 00:56:24,895
[SPEAKER_06]: One is what does it mean for the existing parcels?

521
00:56:25,456 --> 00:56:32,919
[SPEAKER_06]: So that parse that substation, for example, has been zoned commercial for the last 60 years.

522
00:56:33,499 --> 00:56:36,121
[SPEAKER_06]: So why would they sell now?

523
00:56:36,221 --> 00:56:38,302
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we re zoned it something else.

524
00:56:38,322 --> 00:56:41,503
[SPEAKER_06]: So they've had six stories by right as a residential

525
00:56:47,246 --> 00:57:02,999
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's no real reason to think that rezoning it to, and I'm just going to be very specific, five stories by right with two of incentive zoning is any reason to think that they would sell that property and suddenly move that substation.

526
00:57:03,479 --> 00:57:10,224
[SPEAKER_06]: And they certainly could not legally do something that would hurt the city's electrical infrastructure, right?

527
00:57:10,304 --> 00:57:14,748
[SPEAKER_06]: The utilities have a legal obligation to pre-providing

528
00:57:15,489 --> 00:57:27,907
[SPEAKER_06]: adequate electricity natural gas to the city, and they can't say wow we could make a lot of money by selling this and now the city doesn't get as much electricity, like they just they can't do that.

529
00:57:28,949 --> 00:57:30,471
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's sort of one piece of it.

530
00:57:31,052 --> 00:57:34,654
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so this this zoning wouldn't impact that at all.

531
00:57:35,094 --> 00:57:39,636
[SPEAKER_06]: The other question, though, is how does all of this impact the city's infrastructure?

532
00:57:40,076 --> 00:57:46,919
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, there's one thing that I've said in the past that I'll repeat, and then I have sort of a new new offer new information.

533
00:57:47,459 --> 00:57:55,246
[SPEAKER_06]: So one is that if somebody is building a really big building, then there is analysis done.

534
00:57:55,506 --> 00:58:01,692
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got a building permit going through right now for 250 units over on Fells Way.

535
00:58:01,912 --> 00:58:04,815
[SPEAKER_06]: It's one of the 40B properties you're all familiar with.

536
00:58:05,823 --> 00:58:22,791
[SPEAKER_06]: And when they went through their permitting process and they went through their site plan review at that time, engineering looked at their water capacity, their sewer capacity, they looked at all those types of things, the roads at that time, what's the safety, do they need crosswalks?

537
00:58:23,211 --> 00:58:28,113
[SPEAKER_06]: And all of that is put on at the time a big project is actually proposed.

538
00:58:28,894 --> 00:58:31,335
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that's when you're getting, that's when the rubber hits the road.

539
00:58:32,495 --> 00:58:40,859
[SPEAKER_06]: That said, people have been asking about sort of the big picture, like incremental change, you know, how does DPW look at this stuff?

540
00:58:40,899 --> 00:58:42,900
[SPEAKER_06]: How does fire and police look at this stuff?

541
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:59,567
[SPEAKER_06]: And so one of the things that so Danielle and I have sat down with the fire chief, and we're discussing potentially asking him to provide a letter, sort of documenting what he and I discussed about how the roads and increased density would infect

542
00:58:59,887 --> 00:59:10,489
[SPEAKER_06]: affect the fire department and I've also spoken with our DPW commissioner and he would be more than happy to respond to specific questions from the board in writing.

543
00:59:10,929 --> 00:59:21,232
[SPEAKER_06]: He would also be happy to come to a meeting and sort of take questions and some questions he could answer on the fly but really he would then follow that up with

544
00:59:23,192 --> 00:59:29,320
[SPEAKER_06]: responses in writing, but sometimes it's easier to frame the question when you have the person in front of you.

545
00:59:29,420 --> 00:59:36,548
[SPEAKER_06]: And so he and I have talked about him attending one of your upcoming meetings to be able to do that.

546
00:59:37,329 --> 00:59:39,011
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's sufficient.

547
00:59:39,031 --> 00:59:39,932
[SPEAKER_06]: Does that sort of get at it?

548
00:59:40,012 --> 00:59:40,974
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, it does.

549
00:59:41,014 --> 00:59:41,634
[SPEAKER_17]: And if I could just

550
00:59:42,603 --> 00:59:43,724
[SPEAKER_17]: take another 30 seconds here.

551
00:59:43,764 --> 00:59:46,146
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for kicking off those conversations.

552
00:59:46,306 --> 00:59:49,128
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's been a repeated bit of feedback from the public.

553
00:59:49,168 --> 00:59:50,268
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's really important.

554
00:59:51,409 --> 00:59:59,035
[SPEAKER_17]: And I appreciate that you've started that process already and that the fire chief and DPW are willing to be participants.

555
00:59:59,475 --> 01:00:06,060
[SPEAKER_17]: And on the utilities thing, frankly, I think that this is a great opportunity just to educate the public.

556
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:07,060
[SPEAKER_17]: I think there's a little bit of,

557
01:00:08,610 --> 01:00:10,751
[SPEAKER_17]: fear, uncertainty, and doubt out there.

558
01:00:10,891 --> 01:00:30,477
[SPEAKER_17]: And the fact that there are, you know, legal protections that the city has around service levels from our utility providers, this is a great opportunity through this rezoning process for us to evangelize that with the public and make sure that people, you know, that if they do have fears, that those fears are put to bed.

559
01:00:31,298 --> 01:00:35,479
[SPEAKER_17]: And if there's something that is legitimate, that we address it, right?

560
01:00:35,739 --> 01:00:37,380
[SPEAKER_17]: Because it is something that people have brought up.

561
01:00:38,806 --> 01:00:39,286
[SPEAKER_17]: over and over.

562
01:00:39,567 --> 01:00:40,907
[SPEAKER_17]: So thank you, Alicia.

563
01:00:41,708 --> 01:00:49,353
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, Ben, I think those are some great opportunities to maybe add to the FAQs of the zoning website that we already have up.

564
01:00:51,254 --> 01:01:01,601
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe it's also an opportunity to include as part of a future presentation, specifically thinking about the next residential zoning meeting that we're having.

565
01:01:03,683 --> 01:01:05,584
[SPEAKER_14]: But yeah, I think you're asking some good questions.

566
01:01:09,425 --> 01:01:11,350
[SPEAKER_14]: And Ari, I see your hand.

567
01:01:11,370 --> 01:01:14,458
[SPEAKER_14]: I did want to kind of just

568
01:01:18,405 --> 01:01:33,057
[SPEAKER_14]: If the board isn't already thinking about it, I just kind of want to throw this out, because this is a discussion I'd like to have in terms of our comfort and confirmation of the renewal of these residential districts from the boundaries.

569
01:01:33,797 --> 01:01:46,387
[SPEAKER_14]: So if you, board, Adam, Sabrina, Ben, Ari, if you haven't been thinking about it, just start thinking about it, because I'd like to kick off a discussion with us after board member Ari's comment.

570
01:01:49,493 --> 01:01:50,454
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks, Madam Chair.

571
01:01:51,134 --> 01:01:55,137
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm happy to say that I think that's a smart move.

572
01:01:55,177 --> 01:01:57,138
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's not confuse ourselves.

573
01:01:58,359 --> 01:02:00,620
[SPEAKER_10]: And Medford Square is my neighborhood.

574
01:02:01,601 --> 01:02:03,842
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it makes sense to separate them out.

575
01:02:04,222 --> 01:02:15,129
[SPEAKER_10]: And I do want to second member Ben's suggestions about kind of very intentional simplification for the purpose of clarity for public materials.

576
01:02:17,195 --> 01:02:20,037
[SPEAKER_10]: The public has shown a huge appetite for wanting to be involved.

577
01:02:20,117 --> 01:02:21,758
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's make it possible.

578
01:02:23,619 --> 01:02:27,301
[SPEAKER_10]: The comment I wanted to make with Medford square kind of.

579
01:02:29,222 --> 01:02:31,403
[SPEAKER_10]: Pet gripe the.

580
01:02:32,403 --> 01:02:36,686
[SPEAKER_10]: Pedestrian crossing at Salem street coming out of Ashland is a death trap.

581
01:02:37,296 --> 01:02:38,897
[SPEAKER_10]: I have complained about it many times.

582
01:02:38,957 --> 01:02:40,038
[SPEAKER_10]: I know my neighbors have.

583
01:02:40,178 --> 01:02:41,619
[SPEAKER_10]: I've almost been hit multiple times.

584
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:45,062
[SPEAKER_10]: People are flying off of the exit from 93.

585
01:02:46,303 --> 01:02:53,649
[SPEAKER_10]: And I will use my opportunity on this board to say that we're rezoning this.

586
01:02:53,689 --> 01:02:56,511
[SPEAKER_10]: We're trying to make it an active pedestrian-friendly area.

587
01:02:57,412 --> 01:02:58,653
[SPEAKER_10]: That crosswalk is a problem.

588
01:03:04,371 --> 01:03:10,295
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I wish that wasn't your experience, but this is a great time to note those things.

589
01:03:10,475 --> 01:03:12,756
[SPEAKER_14]: I see board member John's hand.

590
01:03:16,379 --> 01:03:16,819
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

591
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:18,680
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you hear me okay?

592
01:03:21,042 --> 01:03:21,602
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess so.

593
01:03:23,784 --> 01:03:24,664
[SPEAKER_14]: Zoomers, can you hear him?

594
01:03:26,085 --> 01:03:26,626
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, great.

595
01:03:26,726 --> 01:03:33,130
[SPEAKER_02]: First, I wanna thank Ben for bringing up the issue of materials and when they're posted.

596
01:03:33,899 --> 01:03:39,844
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I made the mistake of yesterday, printed out what I thought was the latest version of the memo.

597
01:03:40,785 --> 01:03:46,530
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was sort of confused for the first 20 minutes or so of the presentation because things didn't line up.

598
01:03:47,411 --> 01:03:49,093
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm glad I understand that now.

599
01:03:50,134 --> 01:03:53,757
[SPEAKER_02]: Just for me personally, I need to be able to page through stuff.

600
01:03:54,818 --> 01:03:59,262
[SPEAKER_02]: Just presenting all the tables linearly, it's kind of hard to piece all that together.

601
01:03:59,865 --> 01:04:01,346
[SPEAKER_02]: and understand the real impact.

602
01:04:01,426 --> 01:04:02,506
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you for that.

603
01:04:03,787 --> 01:04:12,472
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, adding to Ben's comments on the infrastructure, I think impact on the schools should also be considered.

604
01:04:13,312 --> 01:04:16,314
[SPEAKER_02]: You talk about adding 200 units on the Felsway.

605
01:04:18,375 --> 01:04:20,496
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how many kids are gonna be there.

606
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:25,280
[SPEAKER_02]: What schools will be going to?

607
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:29,981
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard, I don't know this for a fact, but I've heard that some of the schools are getting overcrowded.

608
01:04:31,122 --> 01:04:33,182
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that should be added to the mix too.

609
01:04:34,522 --> 01:04:44,345
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I have some more specific questions on historic conversions, which I see are part of what's allowed in MX 1, 2, and 3.

610
01:04:48,006 --> 01:04:53,367
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been stated that historic conversions are allowed if there are no changes to the

611
01:04:54,341 --> 01:04:55,482
[SPEAKER_02]: outside of the building.

612
01:04:56,143 --> 01:05:01,707
[SPEAKER_02]: But then at another meeting, I heard someone say, Oh, well, unless that's required to provide access.

613
01:05:02,448 --> 01:05:13,537
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just like to get some clarity on does no changes to the exterior mean no changes or just necessary changes might be okay.

614
01:05:14,418 --> 01:05:15,799
[SPEAKER_02]: And my other question on

615
01:05:16,468 --> 01:05:24,193
[SPEAKER_02]: historic conversions is, I wonder where the 70 years came from, a building of more than 70 years.

616
01:05:24,934 --> 01:05:31,098
[SPEAKER_02]: Because a lot of Medford is, a lot of Medford was built before 1955.

617
01:05:33,239 --> 01:05:37,282
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think most of the buildings that we're talking about were built before 1955.

618
01:05:40,420 --> 01:05:52,605
[SPEAKER_02]: And then my last question is, I think it would be of help to me and perhaps the community, if somebody could pull together the vision of what you're going for for these squares.

619
01:05:53,485 --> 01:05:57,386
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the idea to be a sort of mini version of assembly row?

620
01:05:57,406 --> 01:06:00,367
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that.

621
01:06:01,268 --> 01:06:05,749
[SPEAKER_02]: Or what exactly are we hoping for that we're going to see there?

622
01:06:07,930 --> 01:06:09,931
[SPEAKER_02]: Sort of what it's like now, but with

623
01:06:10,630 --> 01:06:13,672
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of apartment buildings on top of the retail?

624
01:06:15,693 --> 01:06:23,578
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there going to be garage entrances for cars to enter the apartment buildings from the street?

625
01:06:24,398 --> 01:06:28,821
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just at a loss to sort of visualize how this is going to turn out.

626
01:06:36,225 --> 01:06:40,308
[SPEAKER_17]: Would it be OK for me to react to John's feedback quickly?

627
01:06:41,687 --> 01:06:43,308
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, go ahead.

628
01:06:43,748 --> 01:06:55,755
[SPEAKER_17]: I think for Medford Square specifically, and I'm less familiar with the West Medford Square history, but with Medford Square specifically, there's kind of like three

629
01:06:57,357 --> 01:06:59,520
[SPEAKER_17]: Three like anchor documents, right?

630
01:06:59,580 --> 01:07:05,628
[SPEAKER_17]: And I do to John's point, I think it might be nice if we could somehow tie these together for public consumption.

631
01:07:05,748 --> 01:07:08,132
[SPEAKER_17]: There's the city's comprehensive plan, right?

632
01:07:08,172 --> 01:07:12,578
[SPEAKER_17]: Which has been around for several years and has a whole section dedicated to Medford Square.

633
01:07:13,770 --> 01:07:21,855
[SPEAKER_17]: There's the recent development proposal from Transom and the responses to the RFP for the city owned parcels, right?

634
01:07:21,895 --> 01:07:27,658
[SPEAKER_17]: The three big city owned lots with the parking and the mixed use development and the grocery store and all of that.

635
01:07:28,299 --> 01:07:31,041
[SPEAKER_17]: And then there's this rezoning conversation.

636
01:07:31,081 --> 01:07:40,186
[SPEAKER_17]: So there's kind of like three separate categories of information that ultimately will come together in the future of Medford Square.

637
01:07:40,266 --> 01:07:41,127
[SPEAKER_17]: And I do think that

638
01:07:43,257 --> 01:07:57,760
[SPEAKER_17]: it might be worth figuring out how to kind of tie those all together so that the public doesn't feel like they're, and the board frankly, it doesn't feel like they're having to kind of hop between three different stories about one part of the city.

639
01:08:04,841 --> 01:08:07,861
[SPEAKER_14]: I just dropped a link to the comprehensive plan.

640
01:08:08,142 --> 01:08:10,522
[SPEAKER_14]: And in terms of the 70 years, I mean,

641
01:08:11,708 --> 01:08:16,931
[SPEAKER_14]: John, I'm not sure of your exact background, but I remember it had some connection to the Historical Commission.

642
01:08:16,971 --> 01:08:17,631
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that correct?

643
01:08:18,432 --> 01:08:19,832
[SPEAKER_27]: I can answer that, Madam Chair.

644
01:08:20,453 --> 01:08:21,493
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't believe so.

645
01:08:22,394 --> 01:08:24,615
[SPEAKER_02]: The Historical Commission... The Historical Society?

646
01:08:24,835 --> 01:08:25,235
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no.

647
01:08:25,896 --> 01:08:32,299
[SPEAKER_02]: Commission reviews demolition of buildings that are over 100 years old.

648
01:08:32,879 --> 01:08:35,921
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Society, by the way, has nothing to do with any of this.

649
01:08:36,001 --> 01:08:36,261
[SPEAKER_02]: We're a 501c3.

650
01:08:41,833 --> 01:08:43,795
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, you were part of the Historical Society.

651
01:08:43,895 --> 01:08:44,355
[SPEAKER_15]: Correct.

652
01:08:44,595 --> 01:08:55,224
[SPEAKER_14]: So I would say if you have a more appropriate recommendation than 70 years, you might be a good person to put something forth.

653
01:08:56,045 --> 01:09:05,112
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess my question more broadly is, why is there a particular age of the building to qualify for historic conversion?

654
01:09:05,232 --> 01:09:10,516
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if it's a good idea for a building that was built in 1955, why not one that was built in 1990?

655
01:09:12,509 --> 01:09:13,643
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that's a great question.

656
01:09:20,113 --> 01:09:23,135
[SPEAKER_27]: Madam Chair, I can address the year if it's okay.

657
01:09:23,595 --> 01:09:26,277
[SPEAKER_27]: The 70 year is a typo, it's 75 years.

658
01:09:26,317 --> 01:09:29,900
[SPEAKER_27]: I think we corrected a few meetings back from when it first came in there.

659
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:33,262
[SPEAKER_27]: And it is from the Medford Historical Commission.

660
01:09:34,463 --> 01:09:37,925
[SPEAKER_27]: The commission, I'm just reading from their website and then I'll put it in the link.

661
01:09:38,305 --> 01:09:44,730
[SPEAKER_27]: But the commission is charged with reviewing all requests for demolition of buildings constructed more than 75 years ago.

662
01:09:45,390 --> 01:09:49,273
[SPEAKER_27]: So that's where we got the 75 years and we would be

663
01:09:49,978 --> 01:09:53,219
[SPEAKER_27]: happy to hear reasons for changing that to another number.

664
01:09:53,739 --> 01:09:57,160
[SPEAKER_27]: But I just wanted to let you know the origin of the 75 years.

665
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:03,861
[SPEAKER_14]: But if we change that 75 years, would we have to update it with the historical commission so that they're aligned?

666
01:10:04,542 --> 01:10:06,742
[SPEAKER_27]: No, that's just for the demolition bylaw.

667
01:10:06,762 --> 01:10:09,583
[SPEAKER_27]: It does not have to be the number.

668
01:10:09,923 --> 01:10:10,863
[SPEAKER_27]: And so that was the number.

669
01:10:11,903 --> 01:10:13,184
[SPEAKER_27]: But they don't have to be aligned.

670
01:10:14,564 --> 01:10:18,105
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I just point out that we're talking about two completely different things here?

671
01:10:18,922 --> 01:10:27,745
[SPEAKER_02]: The historical commission has some influence when someone wants to tear down a building or tear down part of the building.

672
01:10:30,146 --> 01:10:33,647
[SPEAKER_02]: Exterior changes, that's all they're concerned about.

673
01:10:34,127 --> 01:10:47,672
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do whatever you want inside the building, no matter young or old, but what we're talking about here is really this idea of converting a building to a more appropriate use if there's room inside it.

674
01:10:48,257 --> 01:10:54,682
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't understand why, how old the building is, has anything to do with that if you're not making any changes to the exterior?

675
01:10:57,105 --> 01:10:58,045
[SPEAKER_27]: Excellent question.

676
01:10:58,065 --> 01:11:02,309
[SPEAKER_27]: And Madam Chair, I can answer the purpose of the historical conversion.

677
01:11:02,969 --> 01:11:09,495
[SPEAKER_27]: So the reason that we were doing the historical conversion is because we had heard fairly early on that people were worried about

678
01:11:10,084 --> 01:11:11,865
[SPEAKER_27]: the loss of historic buildings.

679
01:11:11,945 --> 01:11:16,546
[SPEAKER_27]: And so the way it was, and historic homes in Medford, because Medford has many of them.

680
01:11:17,046 --> 01:11:28,070
[SPEAKER_27]: So the way it was originally structured is that it would give an incentive to retain a historic home because you would be able to create more units out of it.

681
01:11:28,490 --> 01:11:32,732
[SPEAKER_27]: So you're absolutely right, there would be interior changes that would allow those units.

682
01:11:33,232 --> 01:11:38,234
[SPEAKER_27]: And then the idea is that no exterior changes would be allowed except for those

683
01:11:39,370 --> 01:11:42,533
[SPEAKER_27]: by building code to provide access to the new unit.

684
01:11:42,653 --> 01:11:45,575
[SPEAKER_27]: So that is the exterior change that would be allowed.

685
01:11:45,715 --> 01:11:47,436
[SPEAKER_27]: It's building code recommendations.

686
01:11:47,817 --> 01:11:55,862
[SPEAKER_27]: But the idea was to give an incentive so that those buildings would be retained rather than being torn down.

687
01:11:56,023 --> 01:11:59,165
[SPEAKER_27]: So in this case, we were asked to align

688
01:11:59,660 --> 01:12:06,504
[SPEAKER_27]: the age with the age that the Historical Commission uses for demolition of buildings for their review.

689
01:12:07,165 --> 01:12:13,328
[SPEAKER_27]: Again, happy to hear another number, but just giving you the background of where those numbers and where the intent came from.

690
01:12:20,833 --> 01:12:22,514
[SPEAKER_13]: John, do you have any reactions to that?

691
01:12:23,315 --> 01:12:25,216
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, I don't think this is the point.

692
01:12:25,356 --> 01:12:28,598
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the time to sort of debate that particular point, is it?

693
01:12:30,654 --> 01:12:32,775
[SPEAKER_02]: But I thank you for clarifying that.

694
01:12:33,856 --> 01:12:42,721
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to hear the idea of the vision for what's happening here, a broadly stated vision from our planners.

695
01:12:44,462 --> 01:12:49,505
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me find the page in the comprehensive plan and then send that to your way.

696
01:12:49,565 --> 01:12:54,267
[SPEAKER_14]: But Alicia and Danielle, if you can provide a summary while I look for that.

697
01:12:56,822 --> 01:12:57,923
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you want Madam chair?

698
01:12:57,963 --> 01:13:02,726
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanted to talk about address the historic conversions a bit more.

699
01:13:04,667 --> 01:13:06,708
[SPEAKER_08]: Would you want me want to come back to that?

700
01:13:06,949 --> 01:13:16,995
[SPEAKER_08]: Or because I wanted to address that I as staff would be recommending changes to strengthen those design standards.

701
01:13:17,215 --> 01:13:19,417
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that additional

702
01:13:20,658 --> 01:13:27,350
[SPEAKER_08]: Egress doors should be on side elevations and on the front facade so that it still reads.

703
01:13:28,271 --> 01:13:33,400
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, is that original structure was built and the idea.

704
01:13:35,548 --> 01:13:58,932
[SPEAKER_08]: of some of these areas that may be not being up zoned as much because of the large amount of these older, like larger historic homes, that that would incentivize adding the units within the existing structure so that the built character does not change as much.

705
01:13:59,593 --> 01:14:27,940
[SPEAKER_08]: because we're hearing a lot of, you know, this is the look and feel, you know, the historic fabric of this old historic community, some of the existing mature trees, mature landscapes, and this could be a way to add gentle density in some of these historic areas so that density doesn't have to be at odds with historic preservation.

706
01:14:33,951 --> 01:14:35,611
[SPEAKER_14]: Great, that's helpful information to have.

707
01:14:36,112 --> 01:14:47,354
[SPEAKER_14]: So in terms of what we're talking about today, just to kind of recenter us, I'm going to go back to the PDF.

708
01:14:59,552 --> 01:15:10,142
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, so just to clarify, is historic conversion present in the mixed-use districts that we're talking about today?

709
01:15:15,006 --> 01:15:18,609
[SPEAKER_02]: My version of the document has it a yes for MX1, 2, and 3.

710
01:15:20,117 --> 01:15:35,603
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Madam Chair, one of the things that I wanted to raise is that I'm unclear that there are any properties in those areas that would qualify, because my understanding was that it was a single family home, that might be a moot point anyways.

711
01:15:36,932 --> 01:15:45,620
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I was actually just going on Google Maps to see if there were literally any and in Medford Square.

712
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:48,002
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it's in 1B, 2A.

713
01:15:48,582 --> 01:15:50,544
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, for removing the residential, where's that?

714
01:15:51,044 --> 01:15:53,747
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, but it's, right, so it's not in the 1A.

715
01:15:54,267 --> 01:16:01,454
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's allowed, what the Innes Associates put in their presentation was to recommend adding

716
01:16:02,014 --> 01:16:07,615
[SPEAKER_06]: historic commission to MX 1B and 2A, which is the pale blue and the dark blue.

717
01:16:07,635 --> 01:16:15,077
[SPEAKER_06]: And in West Medford Square, if you don't mind, I kind of want to group the three unit dwelling in with this.

718
01:16:15,597 --> 01:16:21,459
[SPEAKER_06]: So in West Medford Square, there's none of the light blue area at all being recommended at this time.

719
01:16:22,539 --> 01:16:35,386
[SPEAKER_06]: There are, however, in some of the purple areas, so there may actually be some some houses along some of the roads in the dark blue areas in West Medford Square.

720
01:16:38,053 --> 01:16:40,234
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I was trying to figure out.

721
01:16:40,515 --> 01:16:44,958
[SPEAKER_06]: Are there any of these areas that could be either commercial?

722
01:16:45,319 --> 01:16:46,319
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is the question.

723
01:16:46,359 --> 01:16:52,244
[SPEAKER_06]: Ground floor commercial also, or the mixed use also has a strong active component.

724
01:16:52,564 --> 01:16:57,608
[SPEAKER_06]: This is where having residential stoops would be allowed because you wouldn't necessarily need to make it be

725
01:16:58,389 --> 01:17:25,241
[SPEAKER_06]: a house it could be and it could be it's actually I think in the corridors where you'll see areas where you'll say well actually you could put houses in between these stores and that would be lovely but in Medford Square you don't want somebody putting a house along High Street or Salem Street in the areas that are highlighted those are already more dense than that right if you if you look at those areas and that was some of my

726
01:17:26,190 --> 01:17:31,095
[SPEAKER_06]: My question here, and are there any houses that would qualify?

727
01:17:31,155 --> 01:17:39,902
[SPEAKER_06]: Because if the properties don't exist, then the conversation is not an it's not unuseful because it does need to happen.

728
01:17:40,163 --> 01:17:42,845
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's appropriate to happen in the residential zoning.

729
01:17:44,146 --> 01:17:44,547
[SPEAKER_06]: Kieran.

730
01:17:51,013 --> 01:17:52,474
[SPEAKER_14]: So how do we get an answer there?

731
01:17:56,360 --> 01:17:57,741
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi Emily, I see your hand.

732
01:17:58,642 --> 01:17:59,602
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

733
01:18:00,283 --> 01:18:08,428
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm actually looking at the interactive map where we have the age of buildings and we can sort it by the districts that we're looking at.

734
01:18:08,528 --> 01:18:12,411
[SPEAKER_27]: There are buildings of an age that would qualify for historic conversion.

735
01:18:12,951 --> 01:18:18,395
[SPEAKER_27]: It would take us a little better that are within the districts we're looking at, but it would take us a little bit more time, I suspect.

736
01:18:18,935 --> 01:18:24,099
[SPEAKER_27]: that most of them are commercial, but there might be a scattered residential or two.

737
01:18:24,279 --> 01:18:26,801
[SPEAKER_27]: So we would need to confirm that for you.

738
01:18:26,921 --> 01:18:41,452
[SPEAKER_27]: I do agree, however, that while this is an important conversation, there are probably fewer buildings that would be affected by this, especially now that we've taken the residential out than would be affected by other parts of the zoning.

739
01:18:46,047 --> 01:18:51,689
[SPEAKER_14]: So I want to toss it back to John as the person who brought up the historic conversion.

740
01:18:52,269 --> 01:18:54,270
[SPEAKER_14]: Is this something you'd like to continue discussing?

741
01:18:55,010 --> 01:18:55,971
[SPEAKER_14]: We can come back to it.

742
01:18:56,151 --> 01:18:57,591
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I would like to.

743
01:18:58,091 --> 01:19:01,313
[SPEAKER_14]: Related to the West Medford Square and Medford Square?

744
01:19:01,573 --> 01:19:05,554
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hobbled a bit by the fact that I'm looking at the April 30th maps.

745
01:19:05,754 --> 01:19:13,217
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's hard for me to figure out which buildings are in which color.

746
01:19:20,667 --> 01:19:21,448
[SPEAKER_02]: April 30.

747
01:19:25,253 --> 01:19:26,856
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see if we can get you updated ones.

748
01:19:31,258 --> 01:19:42,365
[SPEAKER_14]: Danielle or potentially Christian, would it be possible to print the updated, just those like couple of pages so that John has those physical copies?

749
01:19:43,466 --> 01:19:45,247
[SPEAKER_14]: Cause it sounds like that's what he's more comfortable with.

750
01:19:45,287 --> 01:19:48,309
[SPEAKER_14]: Would we be able to do that in the next couple?

751
01:19:48,689 --> 01:19:48,890
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

752
01:19:49,270 --> 01:19:50,851
[SPEAKER_14]: So maybe we can take a break.

753
01:19:51,891 --> 01:19:55,474
[SPEAKER_14]: This might be a good time to take a break and then John will make sure that you have the,

754
01:19:56,385 --> 01:20:01,767
[SPEAKER_14]: all the updated information, physical copies, and then we can come back.

755
01:20:03,207 --> 01:20:04,768
[SPEAKER_14]: I wanna look at the rest of the board.

756
01:20:04,788 --> 01:20:07,228
[SPEAKER_14]: Are we okay with like a 10 minute break?

757
01:20:07,588 --> 01:20:08,249
[SPEAKER_14]: I see some thumbs.

758
01:20:09,449 --> 01:20:16,271
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep, I do wanna flag that I got a message that a member of the public was having trouble at the front door.

759
01:20:16,331 --> 01:20:19,932
[SPEAKER_10]: So if we can just have someone make sure that that's appropriately open.

760
01:20:21,393 --> 01:20:22,833
[SPEAKER_14]: The front door of the city hall?

761
01:20:23,353 --> 01:20:23,533
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

762
01:20:24,394 --> 01:20:25,554
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, shoot, okay, yeah.

763
01:20:26,402 --> 01:20:27,422
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll go check that for sure.

764
01:20:27,442 --> 01:20:29,123
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Ari.

765
01:20:29,143 --> 01:20:31,863
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, 10-minute break.

766
01:20:31,903 --> 01:20:34,044
[SPEAKER_14]: We will return at 8.15.

767
01:20:35,884 --> 01:20:44,186
[SPEAKER_14]: And before we went on break, one of the things we were talking about is kind of the vision for these squares.

768
01:20:45,106 --> 01:20:50,427
[SPEAKER_14]: And I was going to pass it over to Alicia, who's going to share some more information about that.

769
01:20:52,075 --> 01:20:52,415
[SPEAKER_06]: Alicia.

770
01:20:53,276 --> 01:20:53,736
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

771
01:20:53,936 --> 01:21:11,806
[SPEAKER_06]: So one of the things that I feel like we talked about very early on and a while ago, but wasn't sort of talked about tonight was the looking at what actually exists in the squares and what the current zoning is and what we would really like to be seeing and.

772
01:21:13,067 --> 01:21:21,770
[SPEAKER_06]: There is the current zoning actually allows four-story commercial, it allows six-story residential, but it doesn't have a type called mixed use.

773
01:21:22,230 --> 01:21:28,673
[SPEAKER_06]: So when buildings want to have ground floor commercial with residential above, they have to jump through extra hoops through zoning.

774
01:21:29,133 --> 01:21:33,715
[SPEAKER_06]: And that becomes kind of problematic, more expensive for developers, they're less likely to do it.

775
01:21:33,795 --> 01:21:36,936
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's easier for them to build a single-story commercial building,

776
01:21:37,576 --> 01:21:39,618
[SPEAKER_06]: or a multi story residential building.

777
01:21:40,018 --> 01:21:45,623
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that's what you see in several places in our squares and not completely there are some mixed use buildings.

778
01:21:47,064 --> 01:21:54,069
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's even some of the ones that are mixed use today have gone through the variance process over the last three years.

779
01:21:55,250 --> 01:22:12,487
[SPEAKER_06]: So what we know from economic development is that small businesses thrive on having people nearby, who frequent those businesses, and that if you have people who live in apartments above cafes and bakeries and little stores like that.

780
01:22:12,967 --> 01:22:23,953
[SPEAKER_06]: they are dramatically more likely to go downstairs and buy from those stores regularly and frequently than somebody who lives even just three blocks away or four blocks away.

781
01:22:24,493 --> 01:22:31,197
[SPEAKER_06]: And so having a density of people who live above the stores is actually a really good thing.

782
01:22:31,617 --> 01:22:33,618
[SPEAKER_06]: So making that a simpler path

783
01:22:34,098 --> 01:22:40,484
[SPEAKER_06]: for developers so that we would see more apartments above businesses is something we would like to see.

784
01:22:40,524 --> 01:22:49,812
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what we already have a lot of in Medford Square and West Medford Square, but we'd like to see more as we modernize this as a regular type.

785
01:22:50,252 --> 01:22:55,497
[SPEAKER_06]: And it also signals to developers we'd like to see this and not it's a special hoop you have to jump through.

786
01:22:57,437 --> 01:22:59,518
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that that kind of hits it.

787
01:22:59,598 --> 01:23:21,623
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not like that we're going for assembly row, so much as we're going for small walkable downtown districts that are nice for people to live in and shop in, and also having the additional residents living in your downtown means that you have people coming and going at night, so you automatically have a more vibrant

788
01:23:22,246 --> 01:23:30,873
[SPEAKER_06]: community, because there are people there in the evenings, even if they're not coming going to the bank, they're going home to their apartment upstairs.

789
01:23:31,813 --> 01:23:39,859
[SPEAKER_06]: The other thing, is it okay if I sort of mentioned the garage that I mentioned garages that I mentioned on the break, because that's just sort of another piece of this.

790
01:23:40,700 --> 01:23:49,265
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, this is a slightly new topic, kind of going specifically into the table of uses just to flag that for board members, right.

791
01:23:49,605 --> 01:23:58,610
[SPEAKER_06]: So in our table in the table of uses, we didn't allow or the currently recommended version is not allowing all the different parking garage types.

792
01:23:59,771 --> 01:24:06,299
[SPEAKER_06]: Including allowing principal parking garages accessory, but nearby a couple blocks away.

793
01:24:06,799 --> 01:24:13,768
[SPEAKER_06]: And so something that I think we would benefit from is the idea that developers could build a private garage.

794
01:24:14,649 --> 01:24:22,473
[SPEAKER_06]: two blocks from their apartment building or their mixed-use building, and then their tenants could walk over there to get their cars.

795
01:24:22,493 --> 01:24:40,381
[SPEAKER_06]: So they would have some place that they're able and illegally allowed to park, but it doesn't have to be them turning off of High Street to go under the building, you know, next to the businesses on High Street or next to the businesses on Salem Street, that they might have a separate parcel where they park their vehicles.

796
01:24:41,301 --> 01:24:42,262
[SPEAKER_06]: And that would allow

797
01:24:43,102 --> 01:24:46,786
[SPEAKER_06]: more development and residential development in the area.

798
01:24:46,806 --> 01:24:53,954
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was one of the things that we we've been talking about is this idea of allowing parking garages.

799
01:24:53,974 --> 01:25:05,285
[SPEAKER_06]: I know there's a lot of interest in the city building parking garages and that's one of the things that's under discussion, but also private developers may choose that that is the better way to take advantage of their properties.

800
01:25:05,986 --> 01:25:07,446
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just wanted to put that out there.

801
01:25:07,606 --> 01:25:19,330
[SPEAKER_06]: It's my recommendation that we allow all the parking garage types in all of these zones in order to incentivize less parking on site and more parking nearby.

802
01:25:19,350 --> 01:25:24,731
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I think that makes sense.

803
01:25:24,751 --> 01:25:30,213
[SPEAKER_14]: Kind of a critical mass of parking rather than a sprinkling of it throughout the squares.

804
01:25:32,152 --> 01:25:41,441
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, one thing I'd like to add from my own experience is developments like Assembly Square and even what's happening in Union Square in Somerville right now.

805
01:25:41,662 --> 01:25:47,687
[SPEAKER_14]: Those were part of urban renewal areas where a master developer was selected.

806
01:25:47,708 --> 01:25:52,112
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't believe we have plans to select a master developer.

807
01:25:54,225 --> 01:25:54,465
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

808
01:25:55,445 --> 01:25:58,266
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, but not for like the entire square, like we're not.

809
01:25:59,026 --> 01:26:00,607
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, we're not declaring anything.

810
01:26:00,627 --> 01:26:10,089
[SPEAKER_14]: What is it blighted decadent decadent or forget what the third thing is, but this is definitely prioritizing.

811
01:26:11,269 --> 01:26:17,111
[SPEAKER_27]: What'd you say, standard housing, blighted decadent blighted area decadent or substandard housing.

812
01:26:18,211 --> 01:26:18,711
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

813
01:26:18,831 --> 01:26:20,612
[SPEAKER_14]: I was pulling from the recesses of my brain there.

814
01:26:20,632 --> 01:26:27,453
[SPEAKER_14]: But yeah, there's there's, you know, I think that this work would support smaller scale development.

815
01:26:28,933 --> 01:26:35,695
[SPEAKER_14]: Some of it might be capital D developers, but then some of it might be, you know, your your neighbors and your friends on this call right now.

816
01:26:36,775 --> 01:26:42,596
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think we're taking a smaller approach to development in these squares.

817
01:26:54,785 --> 01:27:04,668
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think the two topics that we were talking about as a board were historic conversions and then the confirmation of residential removal from the boundaries.

818
01:27:05,248 --> 01:27:11,690
[SPEAKER_14]: But maybe before we get back to those, what I'd love to do is open it up for public comment so we can start to hear some input from the public.

819
01:27:12,590 --> 01:27:16,231
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm already seeing some hands raised.

820
01:27:16,491 --> 01:27:17,112
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, William.

821
01:27:17,172 --> 01:27:17,792
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Paige.

822
01:27:18,392 --> 01:27:21,853
[SPEAKER_14]: I do have to read my standard blurb.

823
01:27:23,569 --> 01:27:26,153
[SPEAKER_14]: But if you know you want to comment, please go ahead and raise your hand.

824
01:27:26,173 --> 01:27:31,381
[SPEAKER_14]: And just as a reminder, we'll be hearing comment.

825
01:27:33,824 --> 01:27:34,085
[SPEAKER_14]: Awesome.

826
01:27:35,509 --> 01:27:38,731
[SPEAKER_14]: We have an in person commenter, so we'll be hearing from them first.

827
01:27:40,132 --> 01:27:42,413
[SPEAKER_14]: But just a reminder in terms of commenting topics.

828
01:27:43,113 --> 01:27:47,555
[SPEAKER_14]: The focus of this hearing is on Medford Square in West Medford Square.

829
01:27:48,656 --> 01:27:56,520
[SPEAKER_14]: If you have comments on the residential zoning, you can, of course, mentioned them, but they wouldn't be entered into public record for that topic.

830
01:27:57,220 --> 01:28:09,886
[SPEAKER_14]: So feel free to chat about them, but the most effective way to get that feedback heard is to complete the feedback form that was dropped in the chat earlier or to send an email to the email address that I'm going to mention shortly.

831
01:28:13,770 --> 01:28:15,733
[SPEAKER_14]: So I will now open the public comment period.

832
01:28:16,213 --> 01:28:22,720
[SPEAKER_14]: Those who wish to provide comments can either come up to the podium or use the raise hand function on Zoom.

833
01:28:23,361 --> 01:28:29,268
[SPEAKER_14]: You can also send an email to OCD at medford-ma.gov before providing your comments.

834
01:28:29,868 --> 01:28:32,671
[SPEAKER_14]: Please state your name and if you're comfortable, your address for the record.

835
01:28:33,522 --> 01:28:42,949
[SPEAKER_14]: A reminder to all meeting participants on Zoom to please refrain from using the chat function to message any comments to city staff or board members, as it is not part of the public record.

836
01:28:43,609 --> 01:28:50,414
[SPEAKER_14]: However, if a participant is having audio or other technical difficulties, you may message staff in the chat for assistance.

837
01:28:51,916 --> 01:28:54,537
[SPEAKER_14]: That is Jack.

838
01:28:55,378 --> 01:28:56,479
[SPEAKER_14]: Jack's still on the call, correct?

839
01:28:59,020 --> 01:29:04,451
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, Jack Podolsky is handling some of our technical support through Zoom.

840
01:29:04,612 --> 01:29:05,413
[SPEAKER_14]: So thanks for that, Jack.

841
01:29:10,242 --> 01:29:13,703
[SPEAKER_14]: I see a slightly smaller crowd than we've had at previous meetings.

842
01:29:13,783 --> 01:29:18,966
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm gonna say each person is gonna get three minutes to speak.

843
01:29:19,486 --> 01:29:29,310
[SPEAKER_14]: As in the past, I encourage you to wrap up your thought within those three minutes, just out of respect for the other people that would like to comment.

844
01:29:30,150 --> 01:29:32,511
[SPEAKER_14]: Alicia or myself will give you about a 30 second warning.

845
01:29:33,071 --> 01:29:36,793
[SPEAKER_14]: If I don't give you the warning on time, then that's my fault.

846
01:29:37,633 --> 01:29:39,294
[SPEAKER_14]: And you'll have 30 seconds from when I warn you.

847
01:29:41,185 --> 01:29:41,725
[SPEAKER_14]: three minutes.

848
01:29:45,466 --> 01:29:45,726
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

849
01:29:53,888 --> 01:29:54,148
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure.

850
01:29:57,588 --> 01:30:03,810
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, gentlemen in the chambers, I believe you are our first public commenter for this.

851
01:30:04,430 --> 01:30:05,930
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you so much for being here in person.

852
01:30:05,950 --> 01:30:06,770
[SPEAKER_14]: We really appreciate it.

853
01:30:07,270 --> 01:30:09,151
[SPEAKER_14]: And just I want to make sure we start the timer.

854
01:30:09,291 --> 01:30:09,491
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

855
01:30:09,631 --> 01:30:10,031
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, good.

856
01:30:11,296 --> 01:30:11,537
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi.

857
01:30:13,099 --> 01:30:13,540
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, hold on.

858
01:30:13,580 --> 01:30:13,760
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry.

859
01:30:13,781 --> 01:30:16,926
[SPEAKER_14]: I have to turn the microphone on.

860
01:30:19,150 --> 01:30:20,112
[SPEAKER_14]: OK, that should be good.

861
01:30:20,933 --> 01:30:21,174
[SPEAKER_25]: OK.

862
01:30:21,815 --> 01:30:23,518
[SPEAKER_25]: Ren Bean, Woodrow Abb and Medford.

863
01:30:24,939 --> 01:30:33,262
[SPEAKER_25]: I took a quick glance at the most up-to-date zoning proposal, and I just wanted to comment and say it generally looks pretty good to me.

864
01:30:33,282 --> 01:30:43,526
[SPEAKER_25]: I heard a little bit of detailed discussion about kind of technicalities about how we can best activate spaces and maybe trying to encourage certain types of uses.

865
01:30:44,046 --> 01:30:49,868
[SPEAKER_25]: I think we all in the city agree we would like to see more of, particularly in Medford Square, which is where I live nearest to, but I think the same is true.

866
01:30:50,708 --> 01:30:58,834
[SPEAKER_25]: West Medford, we'd all like more places to go out to eat and hang out with friends into the evening and get a cup of coffee.

867
01:30:59,794 --> 01:31:05,639
[SPEAKER_25]: For a town of 60,000 people, having two or three coffee shops is really sad.

868
01:31:06,099 --> 01:31:09,261
[SPEAKER_25]: Having the city feel like it's closed at 6.30 is really sad.

869
01:31:12,264 --> 01:31:15,926
[SPEAKER_25]: know, so and I think that we all kind of agree on the goal.

870
01:31:16,066 --> 01:31:28,553
[SPEAKER_25]: And you look at the master plan, and that's kind of laid out in big ish, but you know, a fair amount of detail, we want to densify, we want to create mixed use, we want to activate commercial nodes.

871
01:31:28,873 --> 01:31:36,357
[SPEAKER_25]: And I just I just want to say on the public record and to this council and to anyone else listening to the call that I mean,

872
01:31:37,607 --> 01:31:44,593
[SPEAKER_25]: that there's been a lot of public participation for years and that's kind of been the message that the city has been saying for a long time.

873
01:31:46,274 --> 01:31:47,415
[SPEAKER_25]: And and I just think

874
01:31:48,797 --> 01:31:51,978
[SPEAKER_25]: Now is not the time to go incrementally.

875
01:31:52,719 --> 01:32:01,702
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, I think I was really excited to see up to like, I think it's what eight by right plus for incentive zoning on that big empty lot near 93.

876
01:32:01,742 --> 01:32:08,965
[SPEAKER_25]: I think that's a huge opportunity to create a lot of housing right downtown and I was really happy to hear Alicia talking about.

877
01:32:09,525 --> 01:32:13,529
[SPEAKER_25]: you know, the best way to support small businesses is to give them a lot of customers.

878
01:32:14,450 --> 01:32:24,580
[SPEAKER_25]: I just went out to lunch in Malden earlier today, and just walking around, you can feel that their population density is, what, 60 or 75% denser than ours.

879
01:32:24,700 --> 01:32:31,046
[SPEAKER_25]: And what you feel when you're walking around Malden Center is there's a lot of small businesses that can survive

880
01:32:31,767 --> 01:32:39,452
[SPEAKER_25]: without charging $25 a plate because there's a lot of commercial space for rent and there's a lot of customers so they can do a good trade.

881
01:32:39,472 --> 01:32:47,637
[SPEAKER_25]: And I just like to say, I think I'd like to see that happen in Medford Square.

882
01:32:47,657 --> 01:32:48,017
[SPEAKER_25]: 30 seconds.

883
01:32:48,117 --> 01:32:48,297
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah.

884
01:32:49,038 --> 01:32:56,782
[SPEAKER_25]: I'd like to see more commercial space available for small businesses at a better rate, you know, bigger supply, it makes lower prices.

885
01:32:57,863 --> 01:33:08,909
[SPEAKER_25]: I think we all agree we don't wanna see so many banks and insurance agencies taking up the prime storefront, but one key solution to that problem that it hasn't been explicit in a lot of these conversations is, well, okay, they're on a 15 year lease.

886
01:33:08,929 --> 01:33:11,290
[SPEAKER_25]: They're not going anywhere, make more commercial space.

887
01:33:12,911 --> 01:33:15,853
[SPEAKER_25]: So yeah, I just wanted to say, I hope this happens soon.

888
01:33:15,913 --> 01:33:18,995
[SPEAKER_25]: We don't get bogged down in delays.

889
01:33:19,115 --> 01:33:21,936
[SPEAKER_25]: I know there was a sentiment from another topic, the residential.

890
01:33:26,138 --> 01:33:28,399
[SPEAKER_25]: I think we've been doing this for a long time.

891
01:33:28,439 --> 01:33:29,720
[SPEAKER_25]: This proposal looks really good.

892
01:33:30,260 --> 01:33:34,041
[SPEAKER_25]: And if there, you know, are really big problems, City Council can hash them out.

893
01:33:34,521 --> 01:33:36,082
[SPEAKER_25]: Please pass this quickly.

894
01:33:36,622 --> 01:33:36,882
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

895
01:33:37,583 --> 01:33:38,143
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Red.

896
01:33:38,483 --> 01:33:39,503
[SPEAKER_14]: Really appreciate you being here.

897
01:33:39,883 --> 01:33:40,504
[SPEAKER_14]: Have a nice night.

898
01:33:40,524 --> 01:33:49,067
[SPEAKER_14]: We're gonna move over to our Zoom commenters.

899
01:33:51,047 --> 01:33:51,988
[SPEAKER_14]: I see William Navar.

900
01:33:56,080 --> 01:33:57,721
[SPEAKER_14]: going to get a request to unmute.

901
01:33:58,761 --> 01:33:59,782
[SPEAKER_24]: All right, I seem to have gotten that.

902
01:33:59,802 --> 01:34:01,422
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you for recognizing me.

903
01:34:01,442 --> 01:34:03,363
[SPEAKER_24]: William Navar, 108 Bedford Street.

904
01:34:03,383 --> 01:34:06,524
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm supportive of this moving forward.

905
01:34:06,884 --> 01:34:09,305
[SPEAKER_24]: Basically, it looks reasonably good to me.

906
01:34:09,726 --> 01:34:13,407
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm particularly supportive of zoning for more housing potential in our squares.

907
01:34:13,427 --> 01:34:15,028
[SPEAKER_24]: I want to make the point that

908
01:34:15,994 --> 01:34:27,237
[SPEAKER_24]: When we increase housing potential here at Medford, we're inviting people who might otherwise have to live in yet more car-dependent suburbs and exurbs to live in a more urban environment, and that's good.

909
01:34:27,617 --> 01:34:31,718
[SPEAKER_24]: And in particular, when we grow our squares, we make them livelier urban places.

910
01:34:31,738 --> 01:34:33,838
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, that's the magic of urban squares.

911
01:34:34,138 --> 01:34:36,739
[SPEAKER_24]: They get better when more people are there to enjoy them.

912
01:34:37,259 --> 01:34:42,200
[SPEAKER_24]: And we are ready to embrace that miracle without reservation or apology.

913
01:34:43,467 --> 01:34:48,909
[SPEAKER_24]: I also just want to say that thing Alicia was talking about where the parking can be located off-site.

914
01:34:49,490 --> 01:34:50,810
[SPEAKER_24]: That's a really good idea.

915
01:34:50,830 --> 01:34:51,971
[SPEAKER_24]: You should do that.

916
01:34:52,731 --> 01:34:57,353
[SPEAKER_24]: To the extent we're requiring parking, which we shouldn't, that's the direction we should be going.

917
01:34:57,873 --> 01:35:02,215
[SPEAKER_24]: What's really sad about parking minimums is when they make projects impossible.

918
01:35:03,396 --> 01:35:06,457
[SPEAKER_24]: And this will help with that somewhat.

919
01:35:06,912 --> 01:35:09,733
[SPEAKER_24]: So if that's not in the draft, it needs to go into draft.

920
01:35:09,873 --> 01:35:16,355
[SPEAKER_24]: I didn't really catch exactly where that is procedurally, but Alicia described it very well, and it sounds very good, and we need that.

921
01:35:17,235 --> 01:35:25,078
[SPEAKER_24]: Also, I just want to say, I mean, the amount of public participation there's been on all the zoning, it's a lot to come to.

922
01:35:25,118 --> 01:35:28,519
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm very happy that I'm going to complete my comment before the 9 p.m.

923
01:35:28,539 --> 01:35:32,720
[SPEAKER_24]: fireworks here in my neighborhood, but I do want to say the volume of

924
01:35:33,200 --> 01:35:37,523
[SPEAKER_24]: opportunities to comment can actually be a little bit exhausting.

925
01:35:37,563 --> 01:35:43,666
[SPEAKER_24]: And I think that that side of thing needs to be heard as we go along and we think, do we want more public comment?

926
01:35:44,207 --> 01:35:46,428
[SPEAKER_24]: That has a cost to people coming to so many meetings.

927
01:35:46,628 --> 01:35:46,968
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

928
01:35:51,571 --> 01:35:52,151
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, William.

929
01:35:52,331 --> 01:35:53,232
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciate your comments.

930
01:35:56,114 --> 01:35:59,816
[SPEAKER_14]: The next Zoom commenter we have is Paige Boldini.

931
01:36:06,117 --> 01:36:06,557
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, Paige.

932
01:36:07,038 --> 01:36:07,798
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi there.

933
01:36:08,519 --> 01:36:12,181
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you so much for your time tonight and for all the work that's gone into this process.

934
01:36:12,422 --> 01:36:16,705
[SPEAKER_11]: I appreciate the effort to be proactive, not reactive, but in this case, we need to slow down.

935
01:36:17,185 --> 01:36:17,725
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I'm sorry.

936
01:36:17,805 --> 01:36:23,730
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm Paige Boldini, 37 Winter Street, and my business is my skincare salon on 319 Boston Ave.

937
01:36:24,350 --> 01:36:28,813
[SPEAKER_11]: The zoning reform affects everyone in Medford, and the questions from the communities are still piling up.

938
01:36:29,214 --> 01:36:33,317
[SPEAKER_11]: If we want to be successful, we need more time, more transparency, and more clarity.

939
01:36:34,057 --> 01:36:40,059
[SPEAKER_11]: First question, can this zoning reform strengthen how we address accessibility, especially in affordable and mixed-use housing?

940
01:36:40,439 --> 01:36:43,760
[SPEAKER_11]: Will affordable units be required to meet ADA standards in practice?

941
01:36:44,300 --> 01:36:46,401
[SPEAKER_11]: Will they be located on accessible floors?

942
01:36:46,961 --> 01:36:50,742
[SPEAKER_11]: And is the Affordable Housing Trust involved in making sure these units are truly livable?

943
01:36:51,282 --> 01:36:56,164
[SPEAKER_11]: I appreciate the comments about parking, but also are they accessible for those that need that?

944
01:36:56,864 --> 01:37:01,966
[SPEAKER_11]: Second, what's the plan to support small businesses, especially those leasing space in our squares and corridors?

945
01:37:02,546 --> 01:37:06,467
[SPEAKER_11]: How will we prevent displacement or pricing out during redevelopment?

946
01:37:06,967 --> 01:37:12,769
[SPEAKER_11]: Has there been any research on how these zoning changes might affect rent, parking, or business continuity?

947
01:37:13,369 --> 01:37:17,991
[SPEAKER_11]: Will the city create a transition plan to support businesses facing construction or economic shifts?

948
01:37:18,591 --> 01:37:23,073
[SPEAKER_11]: And how will we make sure mixed use spaces include room for local businesses, not just chains?

949
01:37:23,773 --> 01:37:27,834
[SPEAKER_11]: The third question was kind of asked already, but I do appreciate it.

950
01:37:27,974 --> 01:37:30,435
[SPEAKER_11]: And I love that we are going to get feedback

951
01:37:31,335 --> 01:37:37,016
[SPEAKER_11]: And I would love to hear and see feedback from our fire, DPW, police, traffic, and superintendents.

952
01:37:38,277 --> 01:37:43,598
[SPEAKER_11]: I would love to hear what they think and how they feel about the impact of services, staffing, and the infrastructure.

953
01:37:44,058 --> 01:37:46,558
[SPEAKER_11]: And if we can see those public comments, that would be great.

954
01:37:47,098 --> 01:37:50,399
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you again for your time and continuing this conversation with the community.

955
01:37:50,539 --> 01:37:54,120
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope you consider slowing this process down so that Medford can get it right.

956
01:37:54,480 --> 01:37:54,900
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

957
01:37:58,052 --> 01:38:06,939
[SPEAKER_14]: And just to confirm, Paige, when you talk about slowing it down, are you talking about the residential, you're talking about the squares, you're talking about everything?

958
01:38:10,382 --> 01:38:11,643
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you mind unmuting, Paige, again?

959
01:38:15,403 --> 01:38:17,405
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm good so I couldn't unmute it.

960
01:38:17,905 --> 01:38:18,326
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

961
01:38:19,166 --> 01:38:31,538
[SPEAKER_11]: So obviously tonight is about West Medford Medford Square and as an honored board member of the Chamber of Commerce, I'm speaking specifically to those neighborhoods, because I obviously don't want to mix up my questions.

962
01:38:32,338 --> 01:38:34,020
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know I've emailed you all

963
01:38:34,360 --> 01:38:35,200
[SPEAKER_11]: These questions.

964
01:38:35,420 --> 01:38:41,063
[SPEAKER_11]: So again, I'm hopeful that this is a great way to be respectful of your opportunity in your space.

965
01:38:41,563 --> 01:38:51,207
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think asking these questions is really important because as I shared before, I just want to be a great advocate for those specific businesses slowing down.

966
01:38:51,247 --> 01:38:51,747
[SPEAKER_11]: It's because

967
01:38:52,447 --> 01:38:54,408
[SPEAKER_11]: These questions keep getting asked.

968
01:38:54,628 --> 01:38:57,809
[SPEAKER_11]: And I have yet to hear great responses from everyone.

969
01:38:57,849 --> 01:38:59,229
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that should be able to.

970
01:38:59,249 --> 01:39:00,810
[SPEAKER_11]: I have had some responses.

971
01:39:01,330 --> 01:39:06,592
[SPEAKER_11]: So slowing it down to make sure that we can just really incorporate that and hear from everybody what they think too.

972
01:39:09,167 --> 01:39:09,987
[SPEAKER_14]: Great, thank you, Paige.

973
01:39:10,207 --> 01:39:12,648
[SPEAKER_14]: And we're working hard on getting some of those responses.

974
01:39:13,269 --> 01:39:20,732
[SPEAKER_14]: Alicia mentioned some of the efforts that we're taking around public services, and we're also taking note of the rest of the questions we're hearing tonight.

975
01:39:20,832 --> 01:39:24,793
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you, and appreciate your participation in this process.

976
01:39:27,394 --> 01:39:30,255
[SPEAKER_14]: The next Zoom commenter we have is Ken Garrow.

977
01:39:36,458 --> 01:39:36,658
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi, Ken.

978
01:39:38,130 --> 01:39:40,031
[SPEAKER_18]: So Ken Garrow, 52 Lambert Street.

979
01:39:41,132 --> 01:39:42,453
[SPEAKER_18]: First of all, thanks for this.

980
01:39:42,653 --> 01:39:45,936
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm very excited for everything that you guys have been doing.

981
01:39:47,337 --> 01:39:51,120
[SPEAKER_18]: Obviously, you've all kind of heard from me for a while now.

982
01:39:52,060 --> 01:39:59,066
[SPEAKER_18]: I've been kind of tagging along since earlier this year, back in January, paying attention to all this.

983
01:40:01,097 --> 01:40:02,138
[SPEAKER_18]: Really nice updates.

984
01:40:02,638 --> 01:40:11,923
[SPEAKER_18]: I appreciate Emily and team kind of also updating the MX11A1B terminology.

985
01:40:12,023 --> 01:40:12,944
[SPEAKER_18]: I did agree.

986
01:40:13,064 --> 01:40:16,666
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think that came out of a planning and permitting committee discussion.

987
01:40:17,506 --> 01:40:21,108
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm really happy to see that kind of getting disambiguated over the long term.

988
01:40:23,110 --> 01:40:25,531
[SPEAKER_18]: In general, really like what I'm seeing for Medford Square.

989
01:40:26,452 --> 01:40:30,574
[SPEAKER_18]: I am, you know, a 15, 20 minute walk away over in Haines.

990
01:40:32,792 --> 01:40:38,296
[SPEAKER_18]: Similar to what Director Hunt said earlier, I walk around all the time in Haynes Square trying to get a bunch of stuff.

991
01:40:38,496 --> 01:40:44,400
[SPEAKER_18]: I wish there was more density in this area for additional kind of living things.

992
01:40:44,941 --> 01:40:47,963
[SPEAKER_18]: Obviously that holds true over in Medford Square.

993
01:40:48,063 --> 01:40:51,886
[SPEAKER_18]: I lived outside of Medford Square over on Emerson Street for the better part of a decade.

994
01:40:51,946 --> 01:40:53,667
[SPEAKER_18]: So I was in the square all the time.

995
01:40:56,349 --> 01:40:58,030
[SPEAKER_18]: Couple kind of questions.

996
01:40:59,042 --> 01:41:06,345
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe just one because of the incentive zoning I know going back to almost to that historical note.

997
01:41:07,685 --> 01:41:11,107
[SPEAKER_18]: Is it possible to add into the incentive zoning.

998
01:41:11,127 --> 01:41:16,109
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm a kind of historical aesthetic.

999
01:41:16,829 --> 01:41:19,570
[SPEAKER_18]: I know a number of people are kind of afraid of.

1000
01:41:20,295 --> 01:41:26,319
[SPEAKER_18]: general box stores, right in the modern kind of 2020 aesthetic of just steel and plastic.

1001
01:41:27,039 --> 01:41:43,689
[SPEAKER_18]: And if there's a way to kind of incentivize developers to kind of mesh the existing architecture, right, because those four story center portions of Medford Square, right, very, very character driven, and being able to maintain that.

1002
01:41:44,329 --> 01:41:44,549
[SPEAKER_18]: And

1003
01:41:46,687 --> 01:41:50,030
[SPEAKER_18]: probably actually more of an ask from Emily as a direction.

1004
01:41:50,631 --> 01:41:56,215
[SPEAKER_18]: If there's any suggestions around the concepts of parking maximums instead of parking minimums.

1005
01:41:56,395 --> 01:42:00,018
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm in general kind of okay with lowering parking minimums.

1006
01:42:00,459 --> 01:42:04,962
[SPEAKER_18]: Everything I've seen in writing so far has been kind of saying to get rid of them.

1007
01:42:05,623 --> 01:42:10,287
[SPEAKER_18]: But I've kind of been running dry on the concept of parking maximums.

1008
01:42:10,507 --> 01:42:15,131
[SPEAKER_18]: But in general, really like everything and keep on keeping on.

1009
01:42:15,973 --> 01:42:19,336
[SPEAKER_18]: hope it gets passed relatively quickly.

1010
01:42:27,262 --> 01:42:28,403
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for your comments, Ken.

1011
01:42:29,023 --> 01:42:39,011
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm hearing something about, you know, potentially incentivizing historical aesthetics, which may or may not be addressed through design guidelines, which we've talked about, and then parking.

1012
01:42:39,031 --> 01:42:41,313
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I agree with you.

1013
01:42:41,493 --> 01:42:43,795
[SPEAKER_14]: I think, you know, we need to do something about the

1014
01:42:46,280 --> 01:42:47,201
[SPEAKER_14]: the parking minimums.

1015
01:42:47,781 --> 01:42:56,347
[SPEAKER_14]: That's unfortunately not part of the modifications that we're proposing today, but it is an active topic within the city.

1016
01:42:56,487 --> 01:42:58,108
[SPEAKER_14]: So I encourage you to stay tuned.

1017
01:43:01,970 --> 01:43:02,411
[SPEAKER_10]: Anything else?

1018
01:43:02,831 --> 01:43:03,011
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

1019
01:43:03,031 --> 01:43:04,132
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1020
01:43:04,372 --> 01:43:07,554
[SPEAKER_14]: Our next Zoom commenter is Michael Corbett.

1021
01:43:08,595 --> 01:43:08,915
[SPEAKER_14]: Michael?

1022
01:43:11,016 --> 01:43:11,276
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1023
01:43:11,316 --> 01:43:11,437
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.

1024
01:43:11,457 --> 01:43:12,097
[SPEAKER_01]: Can everybody hear me?

1025
01:43:13,857 --> 01:43:14,617
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, thank you.

1026
01:43:14,957 --> 01:43:15,638
[SPEAKER_01]: Super.

1027
01:43:15,718 --> 01:43:18,819
[SPEAKER_01]: Michael Corbett, 26 Jackson Road, Medford, Massachusetts.

1028
01:43:20,099 --> 01:43:21,940
[SPEAKER_01]: Admittedly, late to the game here.

1029
01:43:22,080 --> 01:43:25,661
[SPEAKER_01]: I joined the meeting last week and I'm happy to now be part of the process.

1030
01:43:25,741 --> 01:43:28,962
[SPEAKER_01]: And so once again, thank you everybody for all your work that you've put into this.

1031
01:43:30,243 --> 01:43:32,004
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a lot to like here.

1032
01:43:32,204 --> 01:43:43,454
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like the mixed use vision and starting with the corridors and attracting businesses to the commercial centers of Medford.

1033
01:43:44,435 --> 01:43:46,497
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll kind of just add an anecdotal story.

1034
01:43:46,537 --> 01:43:48,659
[SPEAKER_01]: My wife and I moved here 11 years ago.

1035
01:43:48,679 --> 01:43:50,200
[SPEAKER_01]: We lived just outside of West Medford.

1036
01:43:50,981 --> 01:43:54,303
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were excited to see the rejuvenation of the square.

1037
01:43:54,323 --> 01:43:57,185
[SPEAKER_01]: And within a few years, Snappy Patties moved in.

1038
01:43:57,205 --> 01:43:58,386
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're like, OK, great.

1039
01:43:58,466 --> 01:44:01,408
[SPEAKER_01]: Soon we're going to have four coffee shops and lots of stuff.

1040
01:44:01,988 --> 01:44:03,129
[SPEAKER_01]: And now here we are.

1041
01:44:03,149 --> 01:44:04,490
[SPEAKER_01]: And we still have Snappy Patties.

1042
01:44:04,690 --> 01:44:06,491
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're excited for more things to come.

1043
01:44:08,352 --> 01:44:13,875
[SPEAKER_01]: All that said, I do want to echo some of what Paige had said.

1044
01:44:13,935 --> 01:44:19,757
[SPEAKER_01]: I do think that my recommendation would be to not refer this back to the City Council at this time.

1045
01:44:19,778 --> 01:44:29,022
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard many questions tonight from the CBB to INEZ that seem like they need answers and clarification.

1046
01:44:29,882 --> 01:44:37,868
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so I, in my opinion, I think the board needs to really truly understand the material that's getting referred back to to the city council.

1047
01:44:38,589 --> 01:44:49,017
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, some of the specific things, um, echoing what page had brought up is a holistic understanding of how this impacts the school system, the fire system, the DPW.

1048
01:44:49,838 --> 01:45:02,191
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the other things that have been brought up by Alicia Ben and john tonight and then one specific thing that I would like to see some more information on and this came up both tonight in the context of the.

1049
01:45:03,109 --> 01:45:10,114
[SPEAKER_01]: city centers, but also in the context of residential, is what is the legal definition of historical conversions?

1050
01:45:10,235 --> 01:45:16,179
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that really needs to be interrogated through the lens of how it could be exploited.

1051
01:45:16,199 --> 01:45:18,881
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a little concerned about a

1052
01:45:20,282 --> 01:45:32,928
[SPEAKER_01]: unintendedly perverse incentive to keep historical buildings, but then allow them to have a larger ability to go to more stories or more units.

1053
01:45:32,968 --> 01:45:36,149
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I guess to me, those seem diametrically opposed.

1054
01:45:36,370 --> 01:45:43,213
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I don't quite understand how one cannot change the facade of a historical building.

1055
01:45:44,118 --> 01:45:47,699
[SPEAKER_01]: while still increasing the capacity of it.

1056
01:45:48,259 --> 01:45:53,260
[SPEAKER_01]: And if that's the case, if it can't, then why do we have historical conversions in there in the first place?

1057
01:45:53,320 --> 01:45:54,480
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, I don't quite get that.

1058
01:45:54,520 --> 01:46:05,662
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the last comment related to that is if we are going to go forward with that, we really need to look at the legal language to understand how a developer will look at that and potentially try to exploit it.

1059
01:46:06,282 --> 01:46:06,602
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1060
01:46:11,343 --> 01:46:12,163
[SPEAKER_14]: Great points, Michael.

1061
01:46:12,203 --> 01:46:12,503
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1062
01:46:14,314 --> 01:46:21,263
[SPEAKER_14]: The next commenter that we have is Cheryl R. Hi Cheryl.

1063
01:46:21,283 --> 01:46:22,224
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, can you hear me?

1064
01:46:23,167 --> 01:46:23,687
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, we can.

1065
01:46:23,728 --> 01:46:24,108
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1066
01:46:24,128 --> 01:46:27,831
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, I'm Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park Street in Medford.

1067
01:46:28,171 --> 01:46:34,856
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know I've said this first part before, but this board and the public have been asking for documentation ahead of meetings.

1068
01:46:35,497 --> 01:46:42,322
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't have time today to look an hour before the meeting, which is actually early for us, as most of the time it's posted during the meeting.

1069
01:46:42,923 --> 01:46:47,086
[SPEAKER_05]: How often am I expected to check if I want to look at the data before the meeting?

1070
01:46:47,486 --> 01:46:48,747
[SPEAKER_05]: and I often come up empty.

1071
01:46:49,127 --> 01:46:51,129
[SPEAKER_05]: It feels deliberate and disrespectful.

1072
01:46:51,409 --> 01:46:53,670
[SPEAKER_05]: If we can't keep up, we need to slow down.

1073
01:46:54,291 --> 01:46:56,092
[SPEAKER_05]: We aren't setting this pace.

1074
01:46:58,014 --> 01:46:59,414
[SPEAKER_05]: The public isn't setting this pace.

1075
01:46:59,455 --> 01:47:05,799
[SPEAKER_05]: There is no rush just because people who haven't read this are saying because it isn't available or saying it looks good to them.

1076
01:47:05,919 --> 01:47:08,321
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't look good because it doesn't really exist.

1077
01:47:08,801 --> 01:47:09,922
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to do this right.

1078
01:47:09,942 --> 01:47:13,925
[SPEAKER_05]: I had seconds to review part of this, so I'm not sure if this question

1079
01:47:14,970 --> 01:47:15,991
[SPEAKER_05]: is valid or not.

1080
01:47:16,631 --> 01:47:27,299
[SPEAKER_05]: Is the new building coverage definition going to include the state required to be allowed ADU in the percentage, which I thought was not allowed to be included in the density amount.

1081
01:47:27,799 --> 01:47:33,843
[SPEAKER_05]: Could this prevent most homeowners from adding an ADU if they aren't adding it to an existing structure?

1082
01:47:34,444 --> 01:47:41,469
[SPEAKER_05]: It appears that a covered porch will count towards the lot coverage and could prevent someone from having an ADU.

1083
01:47:42,957 --> 01:47:44,238
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's my one question.

1084
01:47:44,318 --> 01:47:55,324
[SPEAKER_05]: And then just another part is that we're keep referring to the comprehensive plan, which was mostly a wishlist and a list of studies to conduct and strategies to come up with before we zoned.

1085
01:47:56,044 --> 01:48:08,872
[SPEAKER_05]: It was written by a group of consultants, including Ennis and maybe members of the planning department with slides being created before any community feedback had been gathered that had selected quarters and such already in them.

1086
01:48:09,692 --> 01:48:16,694
[SPEAKER_05]: and the pictures and the colored circle stickers at some community events during COVID with a majority of the public participation.

1087
01:48:17,174 --> 01:48:26,436
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why there's so much confusion that this is being used as a roadmap for zoning changes without any study, even if it was based on community feedback.

1088
01:48:26,756 --> 01:48:37,038
[SPEAKER_05]: The old slide decks still exist online and I have read the plan and the slideshows shown to the public and encourage others to do so before claiming it's supposed to be informing our zoning.

1089
01:48:37,678 --> 01:48:39,058
[SPEAKER_05]: Please do this properly.

1090
01:48:39,459 --> 01:48:45,360
[SPEAKER_05]: Sound Street is an example of doing things poorly and quickly, and that also deserves to be revisited later.

1091
01:48:45,600 --> 01:48:46,000
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1092
01:48:51,982 --> 01:48:52,662
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Cheryl.

1093
01:48:52,702 --> 01:48:53,722
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciate your feedback.

1094
01:48:54,283 --> 01:48:58,264
[SPEAKER_14]: And I appreciate your consistent participation in this process as well.

1095
01:48:59,700 --> 01:49:05,405
[SPEAKER_14]: I do want to kind of elevate your question on the ADUs.

1096
01:49:06,425 --> 01:49:10,949
[SPEAKER_14]: Those weren't something we've really talked about with these districts.

1097
01:49:13,591 --> 01:49:19,516
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see, I guess MX1B in Medford Square.

1098
01:49:25,303 --> 01:49:30,933
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I guess and townhouse MX to a Okay, so those both have a D use as part of it.

1099
01:49:34,359 --> 01:49:34,599
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you.

1100
01:49:36,079 --> 01:49:43,783
[SPEAKER_06]: So Alicia, sorry to clarify in the MX districts, ADUs will not be as of right per state law.

1101
01:49:44,244 --> 01:49:48,706
[SPEAKER_06]: So that would be a choice that would be under these proposals.

1102
01:49:49,447 --> 01:49:58,052
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would actually look to Emily, but I don't think we discussed including the ADUs in the MXs.

1103
01:49:58,932 --> 01:50:05,356
[SPEAKER_06]: Separately in the ADU proposal, they could absolutely be a recommendation here to include them

1104
01:50:06,696 --> 01:50:11,940
[SPEAKER_06]: as of right in existing one and two unit, one, two and three unit buildings?

1105
01:50:13,080 --> 01:50:14,341
[SPEAKER_06]: Does it say ADUs?

1106
01:50:15,902 --> 01:50:17,904
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I'm looking at MX-1B.

1107
01:50:18,064 --> 01:50:18,564
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1108
01:50:19,925 --> 01:50:23,427
[SPEAKER_14]: Three unit dwelling has one ADU by right and one by special permit.

1109
01:50:23,607 --> 01:50:29,331
[SPEAKER_14]: And I know we haven't confirmed the ADU language yet.

1110
01:50:29,411 --> 01:50:35,395
[SPEAKER_14]: And I know, I think in this document, we have like, you know, subject to kind of future

1111
01:50:37,630 --> 01:50:38,370
[SPEAKER_14]: What do we say here?

1112
01:50:41,531 --> 01:50:52,714
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a proposal, and I think the comment was about whether increasing the definition of building coverage would prevent people from creating ADUs.

1113
01:50:53,054 --> 01:50:58,035
[SPEAKER_06]: It certainly would have no impact on somebody creating an ADU within their current existing structure.

1114
01:50:58,735 --> 01:51:17,752
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I think the question is really about the other piece and the idea of having the building lot coverage, the building coverage include your ADU and your maximum is to guarantee that neighborhoods that have nice big open yards continue to have nice big open yards.

1115
01:51:18,072 --> 01:51:22,756
[SPEAKER_06]: And if your property is large enough to also have an ADU, then your property is large enough.

1116
01:51:23,377 --> 01:51:25,199
[SPEAKER_06]: But to make sure that we're not building

1117
01:51:27,081 --> 01:51:29,746
[SPEAKER_06]: lot line to lot line in some of our districts.

1118
01:51:30,166 --> 01:51:31,449
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what some of this is about.

1119
01:51:31,469 --> 01:51:32,871
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1120
01:51:33,472 --> 01:51:34,855
[SPEAKER_14]: And Danielle, I see your mic is on.

1121
01:51:35,542 --> 01:51:36,423
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you wanna add something?

1122
01:51:37,264 --> 01:51:38,845
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, thank you, Madam Chair.

1123
01:51:38,945 --> 01:51:58,243
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanted to echo what Alicia said that because these districts don't allow single families by right or by special permit that the protected use ADUs are not required in these districts.

1124
01:51:59,604 --> 01:52:00,645
[SPEAKER_08]: I would not recommend

1125
01:52:01,362 --> 01:52:02,243
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, eliminating.

1126
01:52:02,263 --> 01:52:11,849
[SPEAKER_08]: 80 years being subject to the maximum building coverage because we do want to have, um.

1127
01:52:12,869 --> 01:52:14,631
[SPEAKER_08]: Green space impervious surface.

1128
01:52:14,711 --> 01:52:16,712
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't want to create heat islands.

1129
01:52:16,752 --> 01:52:18,273
[SPEAKER_08]: We want to have a little bit of space.

1130
01:52:19,514 --> 01:52:21,755
[SPEAKER_08]: Currently there are no, um.

1131
01:52:31,225 --> 01:52:34,746
[SPEAKER_08]: I think this is a step in the right direction to start requiring that.

1132
01:52:34,766 --> 01:52:38,367
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, thank you.

1133
01:52:38,387 --> 01:52:41,268
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciate that clarification.

1134
01:52:42,369 --> 01:52:45,450
[SPEAKER_14]: The next Zoom commenter that I see is Cynthia Kuhn.

1135
01:52:49,491 --> 01:52:50,071
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, Cynthia.

1136
01:52:50,091 --> 01:52:50,131
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi.

1137
01:52:52,932 --> 01:52:56,519
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm Cindy Kuhn at 602 High Street in Medford.

1138
01:52:57,320 --> 01:52:59,384
[SPEAKER_26]: And I mainly have a question.

1139
01:52:59,404 --> 01:53:02,430
[SPEAKER_26]: NS Associates indicated that

1140
01:53:03,534 --> 01:53:07,617
[SPEAKER_26]: the daily minimum standard is still to be determined.

1141
01:53:07,997 --> 01:53:24,469
[SPEAKER_26]: And so my question is, in determining that standard, will you take into account the effect on adjacent homeowners who have solar panels?

1142
01:53:28,512 --> 01:53:30,013
[SPEAKER_14]: Cynthia, did you have other questions?

1143
01:53:30,033 --> 01:53:31,955
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to make sure we're using your time.

1144
01:53:32,582 --> 01:53:33,543
[SPEAKER_26]: No, that was mainly it.

1145
01:53:34,423 --> 01:53:34,663
[SPEAKER_14]: OK.

1146
01:53:37,606 --> 01:53:48,173
[SPEAKER_14]: Emily or Paula, I know that the daylight minimum is to be determined in recommended changes, but can you give us a little bit of insight to address Cynthia's question?

1147
01:53:51,202 --> 01:53:57,265
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, if I may, Emily, you can answer whenever you want, um, complete.

1148
01:53:57,626 --> 01:54:00,727
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, that's one of the things that we are looking into.

1149
01:54:00,747 --> 01:54:06,971
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, we had that comment from several, um, uh, community members.

1150
01:54:07,631 --> 01:54:16,656
[SPEAKER_07]: So we will like to also look into, into that, uh, to, to include it in, in the daylight minimum.

1151
01:54:21,365 --> 01:54:22,366
[SPEAKER_14]: OK, so once we.

1152
01:54:23,547 --> 01:54:32,293
[SPEAKER_14]: Once we have some more information about that daylight minimum, would we then have to, but then that that would come before the Community Development Board and we would.

1153
01:54:35,916 --> 01:54:38,458
[SPEAKER_14]: We would update the zoning with that language, is that correct?

1154
01:54:39,890 --> 01:54:48,817
[SPEAKER_27]: That is correct Madam Chair, everything goes, we go from the City Council to you, planning and permitting to City Council, City Council to you, you back to City Council.

1155
01:54:48,897 --> 01:54:52,840
[SPEAKER_27]: So any, any changes would follow that process, including updates.

1156
01:54:53,761 --> 01:54:56,623
[SPEAKER_14]: So the same process that we're following with these squares with the zoning.

1157
01:54:56,683 --> 01:55:01,587
[SPEAKER_14]: So there would be opportunity for public comment specifically on the daylight minimum.

1158
01:55:02,228 --> 01:55:02,788
[SPEAKER_27]: Absolutely.

1159
01:55:03,529 --> 01:55:03,729
[SPEAKER_14]: Great.

1160
01:55:04,089 --> 01:55:04,409
[SPEAKER_14]: Awesome.

1161
01:55:04,830 --> 01:55:05,090
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1162
01:55:09,192 --> 01:55:12,473
[SPEAKER_14]: The next Zoom commenter that I see is Melanie Tringali.

1163
01:55:12,493 --> 01:55:16,615
[SPEAKER_23]: Hi, I'm Melanie Tringali.

1164
01:55:17,476 --> 01:55:24,138
[SPEAKER_23]: I live at 116 Forest Street, so I live right outside of the main square.

1165
01:55:24,158 --> 01:55:27,580
[SPEAKER_23]: And I just want to, I have a couple of comments.

1166
01:55:27,600 --> 01:55:34,963
[SPEAKER_23]: 1, I want to thank, I don't, I remember their names, but there was 2 board members that specifically talked about providing information prior to the meeting.

1167
01:55:35,457 --> 01:55:37,400
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you for that we need that information.

1168
01:55:37,420 --> 01:55:44,811
[SPEAKER_23]: I like Cheryl would not was not able to review the information so a lot of this, I didn't have time to really delve into it.

1169
01:55:46,833 --> 01:55:49,836
[SPEAKER_23]: To the acronyms, I think someone else had mentioned that.

1170
01:55:49,876 --> 01:55:55,801
[SPEAKER_23]: I think that's really helpful, especially for Layman and the majority of the residents here in Medford.

1171
01:55:56,622 --> 01:56:01,446
[SPEAKER_23]: And also there was a comment from one of the board members about an overall plan for each of these squares.

1172
01:56:02,167 --> 01:56:10,034
[SPEAKER_23]: And I think that's really important as we look to how we want to zone these squares for the benefit of the residents.

1173
01:56:11,393 --> 01:56:21,218
[SPEAKER_23]: To given the timing of the information that was received tonight, I agree with page and Michael that this needs to be slowed down and that I don't think there should be moved to the city council for next week.

1174
01:56:22,158 --> 01:56:24,480
[SPEAKER_23]: I think there's a lot of things that still need to be reviewed.

1175
01:56:27,832 --> 01:56:32,338
[SPEAKER_23]: Development of commercial being outside of West Medford Square.

1176
01:56:32,358 --> 01:56:33,960
[SPEAKER_23]: I love to walk to the square.

1177
01:56:33,980 --> 01:56:36,243
[SPEAKER_23]: I love to go to the restaurants and the bars.

1178
01:56:37,304 --> 01:56:38,666
[SPEAKER_23]: I wish there was more shopping.

1179
01:56:38,686 --> 01:56:41,409
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm not sure that we need more density.

1180
01:56:43,131 --> 01:56:45,254
[SPEAKER_23]: I think we need housing, but not a ton of it.

1181
01:56:45,774 --> 01:56:48,096
[SPEAKER_23]: There's tons of traffic in Method Square as it is now.

1182
01:56:48,117 --> 01:56:52,701
[SPEAKER_23]: Adding more density is only going to increase that traffic.

1183
01:56:53,242 --> 01:56:57,546
[SPEAKER_23]: I think there's tons of people in the neighborhood that I know of that want to walk to the square.

1184
01:56:58,827 --> 01:57:01,109
[SPEAKER_23]: and frequent businesses, small businesses.

1185
01:57:01,790 --> 01:57:13,640
[SPEAKER_23]: And I look at Melrose Square, Winchester Square, there's not a whole lot of density there, but those are very vibrant squares with small businesses, lots of restaurants, lots of activity happening, lots of coffee shops.

1186
01:57:14,181 --> 01:57:18,985
[SPEAKER_23]: Winchester Square, I think has three to four different coffee shops, but you don't see a lot of density there.

1187
01:57:19,365 --> 01:57:20,606
[SPEAKER_23]: And they're vibrant squares.

1188
01:57:22,768 --> 01:57:29,631
[SPEAKER_23]: With regards to keeping historical preservation, I actually worked, was on the Historic District Commission for a while.

1189
01:57:29,651 --> 01:57:35,514
[SPEAKER_23]: I know there was a purpose of them of making Medford Square a Historic District Commission.

1190
01:57:35,574 --> 01:57:40,216
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't know where that is, but I'm all in favor of keeping our history and reducing

1191
01:57:43,139 --> 01:57:46,020
[SPEAKER_23]: destruction of any of our history for that in the square.

1192
01:57:46,160 --> 01:57:48,141
[SPEAKER_23]: And lastly, we need parking.

1193
01:57:48,902 --> 01:57:50,042
[SPEAKER_23]: I live on Forest Street.

1194
01:57:50,663 --> 01:57:53,944
[SPEAKER_23]: When there is a show here, the side streets are filled with cars.

1195
01:57:54,464 --> 01:57:57,006
[SPEAKER_23]: No one parks at City Hall.

1196
01:57:57,266 --> 01:57:57,626
[SPEAKER_23]: No one.

1197
01:57:58,226 --> 01:58:00,067
[SPEAKER_23]: No one parks there to visit the show.

1198
01:58:00,347 --> 01:58:02,068
[SPEAKER_23]: They all park on Forest Street.

1199
01:58:04,829 --> 01:58:07,192
[SPEAKER_23]: the residential streets and in the square.

1200
01:58:07,212 --> 01:58:18,725
[SPEAKER_23]: And removing parking within the square puts an onus on elderly and other people that can't walk from distances to go to the bank and to run their errands.

1201
01:58:19,186 --> 01:58:19,526
[SPEAKER_23]: That's it.

1202
01:58:19,666 --> 01:58:20,367
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you very much.

1203
01:58:23,150 --> 01:58:23,751
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Melanie.

1204
01:58:23,771 --> 01:58:24,612
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciate the comments.

1205
01:58:32,782 --> 01:58:36,424
[SPEAKER_14]: The next Zoom commenter that I see is Gil Gabay.

1206
01:58:36,444 --> 01:58:39,266
[SPEAKER_19]: Hi, can you hear me?

1207
01:58:40,106 --> 01:58:41,667
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, thank you, Gil.

1208
01:58:42,307 --> 01:58:44,769
[SPEAKER_19]: Hi, my name is Gil Gabay.

1209
01:58:45,169 --> 01:58:47,050
[SPEAKER_19]: I live at 48 Almond Street.

1210
01:58:48,431 --> 01:58:54,114
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm speaking in support, in full support of the current Medford Square zoning proposals.

1211
01:58:55,575 --> 01:58:59,057
[SPEAKER_19]: I feel the board should act quickly and decisively on the matter.

1212
01:59:00,477 --> 01:59:01,258
[SPEAKER_19]: I, as well as

1213
01:59:02,260 --> 01:59:08,985
[SPEAKER_19]: the people of Medford look forward to a forward thinking and modernized 21st century city.

1214
01:59:10,206 --> 01:59:14,270
[SPEAKER_19]: Walking down Salem Street can be sad at times.

1215
01:59:15,150 --> 01:59:22,536
[SPEAKER_19]: I wish there were, and also Medford squares, I wish there were a lot more housing density as well as small businesses.

1216
01:59:25,478 --> 01:59:29,602
[SPEAKER_19]: I would also like to see a higher minimum green score for higher,

1217
01:59:30,532 --> 01:59:32,232
[SPEAKER_19]: for larger commercial projects.

1218
01:59:33,713 --> 01:59:42,055
[SPEAKER_19]: And I also want to say that I'm getting, I share another commenter's feelings of exhaustion from the meetings.

1219
01:59:42,635 --> 01:59:53,818
[SPEAKER_19]: I've been following many of these and I appreciate all of your hard work on the proposal and I implore all of you to pass it on to the city council.

1220
01:59:54,319 --> 01:59:54,659
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1221
01:59:58,180 --> 01:59:58,660
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Gail.

1222
01:59:58,680 --> 01:59:59,600
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciate your comments.

1223
02:00:01,764 --> 02:00:04,586
[SPEAKER_14]: The next Zoom commenter that I see is Zachary Chertok.

1224
02:00:06,427 --> 02:00:07,167
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you hear me?

1225
02:00:07,948 --> 02:00:08,608
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, thank you.

1226
02:00:09,048 --> 02:00:09,428
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.

1227
02:00:09,468 --> 02:00:11,029
[SPEAKER_00]: So Zach Chertok, 5 Almont Street.

1228
02:00:11,690 --> 02:00:30,520
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to build on Paige Baldini's question that in the spirit of favoring small and more local development in the mixed use zones, is the city preparing to ensure that there's not going to be a scenario where one developer will dominate ownership to the point that you could actually end up with a super zone where one developer could lead a consolidated development plan as happened in Harvard Square recently?

1229
02:00:32,001 --> 02:00:50,898
[SPEAKER_00]: Another question in the same line is around the zoning is that I also want to echo concerns about accessibility with regard to some of the parking narrative as well as the residential access narrative in those zones and what measures are being taken to ensure that regulated affordable housing in the zones and the squares will not simply be placed.

1230
02:00:51,558 --> 02:01:07,517
[SPEAKER_00]: In the back of the building on a semi accessible floor and what building type designation definitions can account for that outside the building code, meaning as part of the zoning and building designations and how is the city coordinating across agencies to manage considerations like that as part of a broader planning initiative.

1231
02:01:08,714 --> 02:01:18,161
[SPEAKER_00]: As one final note, there are urban planning precedents for managing use case designations in tandem with zoning to create a more favorable environment for certain types of businesses over others.

1232
02:01:19,021 --> 02:01:23,404
[SPEAKER_00]: We've brought that up back when we did Salem Street that that could be something to consider.

1233
02:01:24,425 --> 02:01:34,671
[SPEAKER_00]: A commonly cited example is not necessarily the first phase of urban development in Downtown Crossing, which was an issue of blight, but the second wave that took place to weather and ultimately build the Millennium Tower.

1234
02:01:35,391 --> 02:01:41,414
[SPEAKER_00]: Designating spatial zones for consideration with requirements for urban development plans is actually very integral for that.

1235
02:01:41,514 --> 02:01:52,901
[SPEAKER_00]: So that leans back into the second question I asked about cross-agency collaboration within City Hall to hedge against a super developer zone in places like West Medford Square.

1236
02:01:53,681 --> 02:02:03,009
[SPEAKER_00]: and to make sure that ADA considerations are factoring into things like affordable housing and general commercial access in the zone.

1237
02:02:07,934 --> 02:02:09,135
[SPEAKER_14]: Zach, did you have any other questions?

1238
02:02:09,155 --> 02:02:10,176
[SPEAKER_14]: You have about a minute left.

1239
02:02:10,396 --> 02:02:10,796
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all.

1240
02:02:12,358 --> 02:02:17,182
[SPEAKER_14]: I would like to pass it over to city staff, specifically Danielle.

1241
02:02:17,502 --> 02:02:18,063
[SPEAKER_14]: I know you have a

1242
02:02:20,581 --> 02:02:24,703
[SPEAKER_14]: Danielle, are you able to speak to Zach's question about affordable housing?

1243
02:02:24,723 --> 02:02:27,244
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, are they able to put it anywhere in a building?

1244
02:02:27,764 --> 02:02:29,705
[SPEAKER_14]: Can they have it be different quality?

1245
02:02:29,725 --> 02:02:35,668
[SPEAKER_14]: And then, you know, if there's any kind of notes on accessibility that you're aware of.

1246
02:02:38,729 --> 02:02:39,449
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

1247
02:02:39,489 --> 02:02:40,090
[SPEAKER_08]: Through the chair, we

1248
02:02:44,985 --> 02:03:09,312
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to say it was last year we updated the inclusionary zoning ordinance to specifically require that the units be equitably distributed throughout the building so they don't just, you know, cluster them all on one floor or in one area so that it's spread out and that also that there is no distinguishing characteristics, at least

1249
02:03:11,442 --> 02:03:14,944
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, for these units that would be different from the market rate ones.

1250
02:03:15,045 --> 02:03:25,592
[SPEAKER_08]: So they are, you know, exactly the same except for that they are less money and they're open for income qualified folks.

1251
02:03:27,313 --> 02:03:30,855
[SPEAKER_08]: And what was the, there was an additional question or the ADA accessibility?

1252
02:03:31,256 --> 02:03:37,400
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, making sure that these affordable units take into account any accessibility guidelines.

1253
02:03:39,277 --> 02:03:55,356
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we always encourage developers to develop to a universal design standard so that when they're laying out and organizing their floor plans, that doorways are wide and

1254
02:03:58,412 --> 02:04:10,854
[SPEAKER_08]: And some of the the spaces could be accessed by someone using a wheelchair that if they wanted to you needed the counters lower that they're easily modifiable to do that.

1255
02:04:13,485 --> 02:04:18,268
[SPEAKER_08]: But aside from that, it's all required in building code.

1256
02:04:18,688 --> 02:04:27,573
[SPEAKER_08]: So I believe there's a certain percentage that would need to be compliant with ADA.

1257
02:04:27,593 --> 02:04:37,558
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know the building code by heart, but I think it kicks in at a certain unit count threshold.

1258
02:04:38,219 --> 02:04:40,420
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the elevator requirements are

1259
02:04:41,688 --> 02:04:47,231
[SPEAKER_08]: at a certain number of stories, I think four stories where you have to have an elevator served building.

1260
02:04:49,012 --> 02:04:52,153
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe this is something we can bring up at a future meeting.

1261
02:04:52,353 --> 02:04:58,737
[SPEAKER_14]: We can get some more information on this just to clarify, because we've had at least two questions on this.

1262
02:04:59,677 --> 02:05:06,301
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think it would be beneficial for the board, for the public, for the city to get some clarity here.

1263
02:05:06,621 --> 02:05:08,682
[SPEAKER_14]: But I appreciate the insight, Danielle.

1264
02:05:08,702 --> 02:05:08,982
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1265
02:05:10,577 --> 02:05:13,058
[SPEAKER_14]: The next Zoom commenter that I see is Steven Pompeo.

1266
02:05:17,960 --> 02:05:18,361
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1267
02:05:18,381 --> 02:05:20,302
[SPEAKER_22]: Appreciate the opportunity.

1268
02:05:20,322 --> 02:05:21,042
[SPEAKER_22]: Can you hear me OK?

1269
02:05:22,262 --> 02:05:22,983
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, thank you.

1270
02:05:24,904 --> 02:05:30,766
[SPEAKER_22]: It looks like a few things that I had brought up at the last meeting were incorporated, and I appreciate that.

1271
02:05:30,786 --> 02:05:36,669
[SPEAKER_22]: And I just wanted to confirm the non-conformities that were created in West Medford.

1272
02:05:38,623 --> 02:05:43,907
[SPEAKER_22]: Was that corrected with the reduction of the lot size in that zone to 4,000?

1273
02:05:44,087 --> 02:05:52,413
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm gonna refer that.

1274
02:05:53,093 --> 02:05:54,314
[SPEAKER_14]: Steven, did you have more questions?

1275
02:05:55,255 --> 02:05:56,476
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, I did, yeah.

1276
02:05:56,496 --> 02:05:59,518
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, why don't you keep going and then we'll come back to the answers.

1277
02:06:00,158 --> 02:06:01,199
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, that's question one.

1278
02:06:02,680 --> 02:06:05,222
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you for including the parking as an allowed use.

1279
02:06:05,282 --> 02:06:06,202
[SPEAKER_22]: That was really important.

1280
02:06:06,803 --> 02:06:08,144
[SPEAKER_22]: And the third question is,

1281
02:06:09,004 --> 02:06:25,335
[SPEAKER_22]: In Medford Square, the MX1B zone, that was the zone that was being reduced in allowed height from what it is currently now, and also substantially lower in allowed height compared to all its abutters.

1282
02:06:25,855 --> 02:06:29,277
[SPEAKER_22]: And it was pointed out the reason for that was that those properties were historical.

1283
02:06:29,658 --> 02:06:37,863
[SPEAKER_22]: However, I know that the first four starting on the West side of that 1B zone aren't historical properties.

1284
02:06:38,468 --> 02:06:44,354
[SPEAKER_22]: And there are many, many other historical properties in Memphis Square that are in the 2A zone.

1285
02:06:44,854 --> 02:06:53,703
[SPEAKER_22]: So I wanted to see if we could abandon that 1B zone in Memphis Square and make that the same as it's a Butters, which I think is a 2A zone.

1286
02:07:19,665 --> 02:07:20,605
[SPEAKER_08]: Madam Chair, if I may.

1287
02:07:21,386 --> 02:07:22,026
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, sorry, Stephen.

1288
02:07:22,046 --> 02:07:22,726
[SPEAKER_14]: I was just looking.

1289
02:07:23,046 --> 02:07:36,670
[SPEAKER_08]: I won't speak to changes from the last zoning, but I just want to state that the way the Medford does their zoning, there isn't a minimum lot size for the entire zoning district or maximum heights.

1290
02:07:37,591 --> 02:07:43,172
[SPEAKER_08]: It's always been by use for the last 50, 60 years, which is kind of odd.

1291
02:07:43,352 --> 02:07:45,073
[SPEAKER_08]: So how many stories

1292
02:07:48,674 --> 02:07:57,360
[SPEAKER_08]: a property owner can build or what the lot size requirement will be is determined by what the use of the building is.

1293
02:07:57,880 --> 02:08:03,364
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's why when you look in the square, you'll see that there is a tall hotel.

1294
02:08:03,384 --> 02:08:06,966
[SPEAKER_08]: That hotel is conforming because hotels can be taller.

1295
02:08:08,127 --> 02:08:19,539
[SPEAKER_08]: But apartment buildings can't be so the the tower, um, like the salt and cell towers is actually non conforming because it's even though it's about the same height.

1296
02:08:20,299 --> 02:08:25,144
[SPEAKER_08]: They can only be, I think, three stories or four stories right now apartment buildings in the square.

1297
02:08:26,025 --> 02:08:27,526
[SPEAKER_08]: But hotels can be the 15.

1298
02:08:27,967 --> 02:08:28,848
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's not a

1299
02:08:30,576 --> 02:08:40,897
[SPEAKER_08]: There isn't a blanket up zoning or down zoning of the uses of the properties in the square because it's not been by zone, it's been by use.

1300
02:08:57,430 --> 02:08:59,171
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, I was just pulling up the tables.

1301
02:08:59,471 --> 02:09:10,639
[SPEAKER_06]: So the current recommendations from the consultants was to go for lot sizes in the 1B and the 2A to 3,000 square feet and to the 2B and 3A to 4,000 square feet.

1302
02:09:16,342 --> 02:09:19,364
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and I do see that Emily and Paola have their hands up now.

1303
02:09:19,404 --> 02:09:36,517
[SPEAKER_06]: I suspect they were looking some things up as well, because part of the question was all about, um, the group of buildings that are along the river, um, and why those are still recommended to be shorter, that maybe some of those property owners would like to develop larger buildings along the river there.

1304
02:09:42,901 --> 02:09:43,782
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, Emily and Paola?

1305
02:09:46,877 --> 02:09:48,838
[SPEAKER_27]: I'll speak first and then Paula can join in.

1306
02:09:49,859 --> 02:09:53,821
[SPEAKER_27]: The mixed-use 1B was not just the historic properties.

1307
02:09:53,881 --> 02:10:02,525
[SPEAKER_27]: There are historic properties, both conforming and non-conforming throughout both squares, including commercial and residential only.

1308
02:10:03,545 --> 02:10:06,167
[SPEAKER_27]: It is to do with the lot depths.

1309
02:10:07,388 --> 02:10:09,169
[SPEAKER_27]: Those buildings are right along the river.

1310
02:10:10,990 --> 02:10:17,134
[SPEAKER_27]: They are quite shallow parcels when compared to the parcels in most of the rest of the square.

1311
02:10:17,154 --> 02:10:22,238
[SPEAKER_27]: And the thought is that so right now the proposed zoning

1312
02:10:22,758 --> 02:10:28,241
[SPEAKER_27]: is four stories by right and one story as an incentive zone for a total of five stories.

1313
02:10:29,081 --> 02:10:36,605
[SPEAKER_27]: The thought is that it might not be as easy to go above five stories there because of the shallowness of the lots.

1314
02:10:36,725 --> 02:10:39,646
[SPEAKER_27]: So that's why, it's principally why the 1B is there.

1315
02:10:40,166 --> 02:10:42,247
[SPEAKER_27]: We do recognize that there are historic buildings.

1316
02:10:42,287 --> 02:10:51,972
[SPEAKER_27]: It would be nice to keep them or at least keep the facade, but it was most definitely the shallowness of the lots and their proximity to the river compared to the others.

1317
02:10:59,227 --> 02:11:02,811
[SPEAKER_07]: I would like to complete some of that if it's possible.

1318
02:11:03,912 --> 02:11:11,899
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, there in that area in high street, we see a topography change going towards, um.

1319
02:11:12,981 --> 02:11:17,285
[SPEAKER_07]: The the ones that he's mentioning, um, that have a higher.

1320
02:11:20,847 --> 02:11:23,809
[SPEAKER_07]: that have the permanent higher buildings.

1321
02:11:24,770 --> 02:11:31,154
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that is going, it's going lower towards that area to the west side.

1322
02:11:31,954 --> 02:11:36,077
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we can go higher because we can profit from that topography change.

1323
02:11:36,998 --> 02:11:38,981
[SPEAKER_07]: that we do not have in that area.

1324
02:11:39,662 --> 02:11:49,797
[SPEAKER_07]: Also those are specifically south oriented, so if we have them too high then it can cast a lot of shadow on the other side.

1325
02:11:49,837 --> 02:11:50,758
[SPEAKER_07]: So we always try to

1326
02:11:51,519 --> 02:11:53,701
[SPEAKER_07]: to have a little bit of more sunny areas.

1327
02:11:54,942 --> 02:11:59,987
[SPEAKER_07]: Then as we said, we have the river just next to it.

1328
02:12:00,228 --> 02:12:08,816
[SPEAKER_07]: It is not just one reason, there are several why we chose to also give that diversity of the building landscape.

1329
02:12:13,400 --> 02:12:14,140
[SPEAKER_07]: So that is one.

1330
02:12:14,180 --> 02:12:20,942
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the first question that he had, we selected all the lot sizes.

1331
02:12:20,962 --> 02:12:27,985
[SPEAKER_07]: So the lots that were from 3,000 to 4,000, they were very, very little, just a few.

1332
02:12:28,205 --> 02:12:29,785
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we just reduced from 5,000 to 4,000.

1333
02:12:30,045 --> 02:12:34,987
[SPEAKER_07]: So we could include most of them mainly.

1334
02:12:35,867 --> 02:12:36,147
[SPEAKER_07]: So yes.

1335
02:12:52,618 --> 02:13:08,824
[SPEAKER_14]: So you're saying that the mixed-use one in Medford Square went from what had previously been zoned as commercial one, which allowed a six-story residential building, a four-story commercial building.

1336
02:13:09,284 --> 02:13:10,924
[SPEAKER_14]: We're just gonna ignore the 15 stories.

1337
02:13:13,365 --> 02:13:18,067
[SPEAKER_14]: But it went from six and four stories to a max of five stories.

1338
02:13:19,465 --> 02:13:20,427
[SPEAKER_14]: For by right one.

1339
02:13:22,430 --> 02:13:26,697
[SPEAKER_14]: For incentive zoning and the reason for that is because the lot depth.

1340
02:13:27,678 --> 02:13:28,980
[SPEAKER_14]: Are we thinking that because.

1341
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:33,287
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, looking at the rest of the.

1342
02:13:36,152 --> 02:13:50,614
[SPEAKER_14]: the nuances of the zoning, whether it's lot area, you know, facade build out, setbacks, building coverage, was the thought that you just, you could never do more than five?

1343
02:13:53,998 --> 02:13:59,964
[SPEAKER_27]: With respect, Madam Chair, it's zoned for six now and it hasn't been done.

1344
02:13:59,984 --> 02:14:05,410
[SPEAKER_27]: It's zoned for six residential now and there are no six-story residential buildings on there.

1345
02:14:05,890 --> 02:14:07,952
[SPEAKER_27]: Those permissions have already been in place.

1346
02:14:09,254 --> 02:14:14,859
[SPEAKER_27]: It's one extra story if you're commercial, you're zoned for four.

1347
02:14:14,939 --> 02:14:17,182
[SPEAKER_27]: If you're residential, you can do a six-story building.

1348
02:14:17,602 --> 02:14:28,571
[SPEAKER_27]: So we're kind of going up for mixed use from the commercial and down from the residential in that it's still four stories as of right, but we're allowing the one incentive zoning.

1349
02:14:29,471 --> 02:14:37,277
[SPEAKER_27]: So as Paula said, and I should have trusted Paula to remember about the sun, the implications of the sun and the topography.

1350
02:14:38,098 --> 02:14:39,599
[SPEAKER_27]: So it is the shallowness of the lot.

1351
02:14:39,679 --> 02:14:44,743
[SPEAKER_27]: It's the relationship to the other buildings as the topography of the area changes.

1352
02:14:45,261 --> 02:14:48,063
[SPEAKER_27]: It's the impact of taller buildings on that side of the street.

1353
02:14:48,143 --> 02:14:49,524
[SPEAKER_27]: It has multiple reasons.

1354
02:14:50,945 --> 02:14:54,087
[SPEAKER_27]: However, that is just our recommendation.

1355
02:14:54,167 --> 02:15:12,680
[SPEAKER_27]: And we're here is to listen to public comment and understand where other people, whether it's somebody from the public speaking or yourselves or city staff or other city officials have a difference and a reason that they would like to consider something else.

1356
02:15:12,760 --> 02:15:14,822
[SPEAKER_27]: But those are the reasons for our recommendation.

1357
02:15:16,338 --> 02:15:27,105
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, when we go back to board discussion, that's something I'd like us as a board to chat about, that MX1 in Medford Square.

1358
02:15:30,607 --> 02:15:32,468
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for your questions, Steve, and I appreciate them.

1359
02:15:33,409 --> 02:15:35,710
[SPEAKER_14]: The next Zoom commenter that I have is David McKenna.

1360
02:15:35,730 --> 02:15:41,494
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, and I can hear fireworks in the background.

1361
02:15:42,323 --> 02:15:44,265
[SPEAKER_20]: Hello, thank you for your time tonight.

1362
02:15:45,045 --> 02:15:47,668
[SPEAKER_20]: I want to thank you for your work in this process.

1363
02:15:47,708 --> 02:15:51,171
[SPEAKER_20]: I think this is the third meeting I've been to about the zoning in.

1364
02:15:52,918 --> 02:15:58,620
[SPEAKER_20]: Downtown, I live at 2 Vine Street, which is just a 7-minute walk from City Hall, so very close.

1365
02:15:58,721 --> 02:16:14,146
[SPEAKER_20]: I often visit the square, and I'm really excited for this new zoning to revitalize the square, to bring more existing development into conformity, and to allow more development consistent with what's already there.

1366
02:16:16,543 --> 02:16:19,064
[SPEAKER_20]: I just to respond about the process.

1367
02:16:19,745 --> 02:16:25,727
[SPEAKER_20]: I definitely think the CBD board should understand what you know what it's recommending before it makes the final recommendation.

1368
02:16:25,807 --> 02:16:27,228
[SPEAKER_20]: So I don't want to rush anybody.

1369
02:16:27,868 --> 02:16:36,732
[SPEAKER_20]: At the same time, you know, I think if we do continue to have these meetings, you'll have the same people showing up making the same comments, as you know, has been happening at the last.

1370
02:16:38,688 --> 02:16:39,248
[SPEAKER_20]: couple of meetings.

1371
02:16:39,288 --> 02:16:45,610
[SPEAKER_20]: So at some point, I think maybe when you feel that there's nothing new being said, it might make sense to end public comment.

1372
02:16:45,630 --> 02:16:52,151
[SPEAKER_20]: Because we could have the same people show up for a year every two weeks to say, I don't like the square, or I do like the square.

1373
02:16:52,511 --> 02:16:53,792
[SPEAKER_20]: So I think it's a great proposal.

1374
02:16:54,492 --> 02:17:00,093
[SPEAKER_20]: I agree with Stephen's suggestion that I think there could be a little bit more height along that section of High Street.

1375
02:17:00,813 --> 02:17:08,275
[SPEAKER_20]: I would also suggest that on the north side of High Street, that the zoning shouldn't just stop when we hit the library, that the north side of High Street could actually

1376
02:17:08,855 --> 02:17:31,914
[SPEAKER_20]: you know, maybe a lower, like a MX1, given the topography, you know, but there could be some new, that is really part of the square, I think, and it would make, you know, some of our West Medford neighbors who live closer to the square, instead of closer to West Medford Square, it would be more walkable for them if there was businesses or mixed use, you know, on that section of High Street, maybe with not so much height because of the topography.

1377
02:17:34,075 --> 02:17:36,557
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't share a lot of the concerns that I've heard.

1378
02:17:37,177 --> 02:17:40,980
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, why wasn't there, why didn't you talk to the police chief about this proposal?

1379
02:17:41,020 --> 02:17:42,741
[SPEAKER_20]: Why aren't you collaborating with the fire department?

1380
02:17:42,821 --> 02:17:47,464
[SPEAKER_20]: Because maybe just because I've been to so many of these meetings, I think the answers are pretty clear.

1381
02:17:47,584 --> 02:17:50,506
[SPEAKER_20]: Like the fire department gets involved during site plan review.

1382
02:17:51,066 --> 02:17:55,449
[SPEAKER_20]: So maybe I'll just say what I think the answer is and you all could tell me if it's correct.

1383
02:17:55,749 --> 02:17:58,691
[SPEAKER_20]: But the fire department gets involved during site plan review to make sure whatever building

1384
02:17:59,922 --> 02:18:03,045
[SPEAKER_20]: is accessible to the fire department and there's not a problem.

1385
02:18:03,745 --> 02:18:13,452
[SPEAKER_20]: So when a development is actually proposed, and we know that seven to nine stories is not gonna be a problem for the fire department because Medford Square already has buildings up to 12 stories.

1386
02:18:14,052 --> 02:18:15,994
[SPEAKER_20]: So this is not anything new.

1387
02:18:17,917 --> 02:18:19,838
[SPEAKER_20]: And, you know, I think it's the same with the police department.

1388
02:18:19,858 --> 02:18:22,119
[SPEAKER_20]: The police department is not really involved in the zoning.

1389
02:18:23,040 --> 02:18:27,983
[SPEAKER_20]: It's just not, you know, the final point, the ADA is a federal law.

1390
02:18:28,023 --> 02:18:28,644
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm an attorney.

1391
02:18:28,744 --> 02:18:30,365
[SPEAKER_20]: It does apply to larger projects.

1392
02:18:30,785 --> 02:18:37,289
[SPEAKER_20]: And so people who don't want the density, don't want larger projects means that we're not going to have ADA accessible units.

1393
02:18:37,850 --> 02:18:41,672
[SPEAKER_20]: And so I really do think that it is advantageous to have some of these larger developments.

1394
02:18:43,013 --> 02:18:47,514
[SPEAKER_20]: And the final point about one developer buying up everything, the city cannot control who buys what.

1395
02:18:47,915 --> 02:18:51,196
[SPEAKER_20]: It would be illegal for the city to say a developer is not allowed to own two different lots.

1396
02:18:51,916 --> 02:18:59,418
[SPEAKER_20]: So some of these concerns, I understand people have questions, but there's pretty straightforward answers to each question, I believe.

1397
02:19:03,559 --> 02:19:04,200
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, David.

1398
02:19:04,220 --> 02:19:05,480
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciate the insight.

1399
02:19:12,776 --> 02:19:22,728
[SPEAKER_14]: And regarding your comment about MX one towards the north side to the was at the west of the library.

1400
02:19:22,748 --> 02:19:25,411
[SPEAKER_14]: I got to note that

1401
02:19:26,949 --> 02:19:41,242
[SPEAKER_14]: there's a good number of private ways back there, which, you know, we are kind of talking about through the residential zoning process, but that kind of prevents upzoning in those areas for now, for now.

1402
02:19:41,262 --> 02:19:44,926
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, zoning is a gradual process.

1403
02:19:45,426 --> 02:19:46,848
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you know, we're doing our best to

1404
02:19:48,565 --> 02:19:54,009
[SPEAKER_14]: make meaningful, significant changes now, but also kind of set ourselves up for future changes.

1405
02:19:54,789 --> 02:19:58,632
[SPEAKER_14]: But I do appreciate your insight, and those are some really good specific points that you made.

1406
02:20:00,713 --> 02:20:04,156
[SPEAKER_14]: The next Zoom commenter that I see is Jean Nezzo.

1407
02:20:07,756 --> 02:20:08,396
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, can you hear me?

1408
02:20:09,437 --> 02:20:10,017
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, yes, we can.

1409
02:20:10,057 --> 02:20:10,617
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Jean.

1410
02:20:10,957 --> 02:20:13,118
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Jean Izzo, 35 Power Street.

1411
02:20:13,738 --> 02:20:17,660
[SPEAKER_03]: First off, you continue to refer to current zoning not being built.

1412
02:20:17,900 --> 02:20:21,722
[SPEAKER_03]: However, the own lot sizes are not in alignment with the intent.

1413
02:20:22,142 --> 02:20:34,347
[SPEAKER_03]: So one would have to stack parcels to build by right right now, where your new zoning is significantly decreasing the lot square footage requirements, and you could in fact subdivide and multiply the density result.

1414
02:20:34,707 --> 02:20:36,908
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's incredibly disingenuous

1415
02:20:37,428 --> 02:20:40,611
[SPEAKER_03]: to imply that the decision will not open the floodgates of development.

1416
02:20:41,592 --> 02:20:46,936
[SPEAKER_03]: A good number of Medford residents continue to say here tonight that they aren't feeling heard and that we need to slow down.

1417
02:20:47,657 --> 02:21:00,628
[SPEAKER_03]: As someone who has worked in the industry for decades, I find it abhorrent that we continue to move forward without the necessary studies that determine the feasibility to your concepts and proper iterative feedback loop.

1418
02:21:01,248 --> 02:21:06,713
[SPEAKER_03]: It's rapacious and reprehensible that we need to move at a speed that placates, quote, developers.

1419
02:21:07,113 --> 02:21:08,815
[SPEAKER_03]: And I use that term loosely.

1420
02:21:09,455 --> 02:21:15,441
[SPEAKER_03]: Make no mistake here tonight, predatory developers are already door knocking, turning up the heat.

1421
02:21:15,521 --> 02:21:20,805
[SPEAKER_03]: There's money to be made, hand over fist, buy right in some areas, thanks to the effort so far.

1422
02:21:21,226 --> 02:21:23,368
[SPEAKER_03]: And our at-risk and marginalized neighbors

1423
02:21:23,848 --> 02:21:35,751
[SPEAKER_03]: many of which who cannot speak up, especially in this current political climate, will be displaced, even though the studies that you guys continue to point to for justification call out that this should be mitigated.

1424
02:21:36,111 --> 02:21:39,212
[SPEAKER_03]: It isn't, it won't, and no one should pretend otherwise.

1425
02:21:39,572 --> 02:21:53,615
[SPEAKER_03]: You're putting developer profits over residents' needs, considering future potential affluent residents at the expense of the current marginalized residents, and you're putting the cost of development on residents and not where it belongs with the developer flippers.

1426
02:21:54,155 --> 02:21:58,477
[SPEAKER_03]: all of which will land us with a new age city on antiquated infrastructure.

1427
02:21:58,897 --> 02:22:08,000
[SPEAKER_03]: The MBT 3A zoning requirements, which we complied with as of December of 2024, sets a density rate of 15 units per acre.

1428
02:22:08,380 --> 02:22:14,842
[SPEAKER_03]: Your proposal for our city at last calculation is five fold over the state requirement.

1429
02:22:15,282 --> 02:22:19,744
[SPEAKER_03]: Your slide deck scenarios aren't even remotely in alignment with how a developer

1430
02:22:20,044 --> 02:22:24,828
[SPEAKER_03]: will approach their project and financial modeling decision making, no matter the spin.

1431
02:22:25,208 --> 02:22:28,711
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank God, or those playing developer may have taken notes.

1432
02:22:29,331 --> 02:22:36,757
[SPEAKER_03]: For some neighborhoods you continue to move the goal lines, and the public continues to get information, not in advance but instead during the meeting.

1433
02:22:37,097 --> 02:22:40,160
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not proper, it's not inclusive, and it's not just.

1434
02:22:40,740 --> 02:22:48,049
[SPEAKER_03]: Mass General Law 40A section 5, thank you, requires the zoning text be provided in advance.

1435
02:22:48,469 --> 02:22:50,071
[SPEAKER_03]: Please begin to do that.

1436
02:22:50,772 --> 02:22:56,940
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to be in alignment with the industry best practices and the secretariat and agency requirements.

1437
02:22:57,520 --> 02:23:02,785
[SPEAKER_03]: All have been outlined in previous emails to you guys under separate cover by resident industry experts.

1438
02:23:03,225 --> 02:23:13,214
[SPEAKER_03]: So echoing my fellow Medforians, I would like to say, again, we need to slow down, pause, pull the information into a digestible format, and take it back up.

1439
02:23:13,654 --> 02:23:19,199
[SPEAKER_03]: Expertise is the ability to simplify the complex, and this is what our residents are looking for.

1440
02:23:19,539 --> 02:23:19,919
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1441
02:23:22,622 --> 02:23:23,182
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Jean.

1442
02:23:23,202 --> 02:23:24,463
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciate your comments.

1443
02:23:24,784 --> 02:23:25,064
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1444
02:23:26,864 --> 02:23:28,705
[SPEAKER_14]: The next Zoom commenter that we have is Caitlin.

1445
02:23:31,587 --> 02:23:41,394
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi, Caitlin Robinson, 31 Everett Street, and I wanted to say that I support this proposal and I hope that you will pass it.

1446
02:23:42,074 --> 02:23:50,160
[SPEAKER_21]: I also wanted to mention some of the comments about how like currently six floors are allowed, but that hasn't actually happened.

1447
02:23:51,226 --> 02:23:55,690
[SPEAKER_21]: That in part is because there are like other regulations that have made that impossible.

1448
02:23:55,850 --> 02:24:10,002
[SPEAKER_21]: And so I hope that when we're looking at parking minimums and things like that, that we will not make like this current proposal impossible by continuing to have parking minimums that would do that.

1449
02:24:10,303 --> 02:24:10,623
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1450
02:24:15,390 --> 02:24:15,970
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks, Caitlin.

1451
02:24:16,291 --> 02:24:20,053
[SPEAKER_14]: And parking minimums are another conversation that's happening.

1452
02:24:20,773 --> 02:24:23,415
[SPEAKER_14]: So I encourage you to stay tuned in on that.

1453
02:24:26,637 --> 02:24:29,819
[SPEAKER_14]: The next Zoom commenter that I have is Milva McDonald.

1454
02:24:31,140 --> 02:24:31,360
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi.

1455
02:24:31,380 --> 02:24:32,621
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi.

1456
02:24:32,961 --> 02:24:33,382
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1457
02:24:33,922 --> 02:24:36,363
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for taking my question, and thank you for your work.

1458
02:24:37,204 --> 02:24:41,307
[SPEAKER_09]: My question is about, I live near West Medford Square, and

1459
02:24:42,481 --> 02:24:53,086
[SPEAKER_09]: When I look at the map, I'm just curious about how the boundaries of the square were determined and how you made the decision to make some residential properties mixed use.

1460
02:24:55,207 --> 02:25:04,351
[SPEAKER_09]: When you walk out from the square, when you walk down Harvard Ave, there's maybe a block to max of businesses and then the residential area starts.

1461
02:25:05,031 --> 02:25:06,872
[SPEAKER_09]: And it looks to me like the,

1462
02:25:07,918 --> 02:25:23,349
[SPEAKER_09]: It's being stretched now further so that, for instance, there's a gorgeous old house on the corner of Harvard and Boston Ave that is being zoned for mixed-use 2A, which I believe means it could go to seven stories.

1463
02:25:23,890 --> 02:25:26,732
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I think the house next to it is mixed-use 2A.

1464
02:25:28,193 --> 02:25:31,956
[SPEAKER_09]: And then some of the other properties around are urban residential, too.

1465
02:25:32,502 --> 02:25:46,451
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm just curious what the thought process was around that and how you decided to make some residential properties mixed use and basically change an area that is currently residential to something else.

1466
02:25:50,493 --> 02:25:51,974
[SPEAKER_14]: Melva, did you have any other questions?

1467
02:25:52,435 --> 02:25:53,095
[SPEAKER_09]: No, thank you.

1468
02:25:54,189 --> 02:25:56,990
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, what was the you mentioned the beautiful home?

1469
02:25:57,010 --> 02:26:00,752
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you have the address?

1470
02:26:01,232 --> 02:26:02,152
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe it's Yeah.

1471
02:26:02,712 --> 02:26:06,514
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I think the house next to it is also zoned as mixed use too.

1472
02:26:07,854 --> 02:26:10,635
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, I'm looking at the zoning viewer right now.

1473
02:26:11,196 --> 02:26:14,437
[SPEAKER_14]: And this sort of feedback is super helpful, especially with specific addresses.

1474
02:26:17,340 --> 02:26:19,761
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't speak to all of those.

1475
02:26:19,821 --> 02:26:30,466
[SPEAKER_06]: Danielle may have slightly more information, but several of the large buildings that face Boston Ave there that are more home-like are owned by the Catholic Church and are part of the St.

1476
02:26:30,506 --> 02:26:32,047
[SPEAKER_06]: Raphael's campus.

1477
02:26:32,327 --> 02:26:35,529
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, this one's not because I know who lives there and I've been in it many times.

1478
02:26:36,810 --> 02:26:50,762
[SPEAKER_06]: There was an iteration of this where I think they were all zoned for just residential and there was a discussion about the ones that are property of the church should be part of a larger

1479
02:26:51,522 --> 02:26:57,787
[SPEAKER_06]: like allow something larger so the church could do something like a bigger residential development if they were ever to sell.

1480
02:26:59,028 --> 02:27:09,956
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm not sure that we recommended including all the houses on that block or maybe it just got squared off in order to make it a more attractive thing if that ever happened.

1481
02:27:09,976 --> 02:27:11,216
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not certain.

1482
02:27:11,236 --> 02:27:14,699
[SPEAKER_06]: I do know that we asked to have the properties that belong to St.

1483
02:27:14,739 --> 02:27:20,203
[SPEAKER_06]: Raphael as part of sort of the same zoning together and not have them be separated.

1484
02:27:21,713 --> 02:27:26,565
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure if Emily or Danielle or Paola remembers the details on that.

1485
02:27:29,892 --> 02:27:31,753
[SPEAKER_27]: Through you, Madam Chair, if possible.

1486
02:27:32,454 --> 02:27:32,934
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, please.

1487
02:27:33,755 --> 02:27:34,475
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes.

1488
02:27:34,555 --> 02:27:37,937
[SPEAKER_27]: I do remember that.

1489
02:27:37,957 --> 02:27:45,562
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't think we squared it off by accident.

1490
02:27:45,803 --> 02:27:53,568
[SPEAKER_27]: I think we were thinking that because if I'm looking at the right one, there's three houses in a row that are older houses.

1491
02:27:54,579 --> 02:28:03,066
[SPEAKER_27]: We were looking, Paola and I were looking earlier at which existing parcels had housing on them that was historic in this area.

1492
02:28:03,626 --> 02:28:12,272
[SPEAKER_27]: And I think we were thinking that, you know, they could have gone either way for the residential or the mixed use.

1493
02:28:13,883 --> 02:28:20,664
[SPEAKER_27]: Either of them, any of them would be eligible, obviously, for the historic conversion if the dates in the assessor's data are correct.

1494
02:28:20,724 --> 02:28:26,866
[SPEAKER_27]: So again, if there's something where we need to change a boundary, we're happy to look at that.

1495
02:28:27,006 --> 02:28:28,926
[SPEAKER_27]: So I appreciate it being brought to our attention.

1496
02:28:29,366 --> 02:28:34,847
[SPEAKER_27]: Paula, I don't know if you remember further details about those particular parcels relative to others.

1497
02:28:34,927 --> 02:28:38,788
[SPEAKER_27]: I do remember changing the other parcels belonging to the church.

1498
02:28:41,275 --> 02:28:46,257
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so for that specific, uh, I'm not pretty sure this was.

1499
02:28:47,077 --> 02:28:51,920
[SPEAKER_07]: A map that had several iterations and discussions with the city council.

1500
02:28:52,520 --> 02:28:59,923
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, so the city council asked to, um, increase the amount of to, uh, of the mixed uses.

1501
02:29:00,763 --> 02:29:04,985
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, in the area, so that's why I think that part was squared.

1502
02:29:05,685 --> 02:29:06,826
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and then we had.

1503
02:29:07,566 --> 02:29:16,414
[SPEAKER_07]: Also the new corridors, that is Boston Ave, and so that would fit with that transition towards the neighborhood.

1504
02:29:16,854 --> 02:29:21,598
[SPEAKER_07]: So that came from those different iterations to be also included.

1505
02:29:21,618 --> 02:29:23,680
[SPEAKER_07]: I think in the beginning was residential.

1506
02:29:24,560 --> 02:29:29,444
[SPEAKER_07]: Just to clarify, it's mixed use to A, and that is five stories by right, not seven.

1507
02:29:30,245 --> 02:29:31,986
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, I think those are the

1508
02:29:34,040 --> 02:29:36,723
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, I'm looking at the current zoning now.

1509
02:29:36,823 --> 02:29:44,770
[SPEAKER_27]: It's general residential, and I think we've recommended it as urban residential 2 in the first one, which I think the speaker said.

1510
02:29:44,790 --> 02:29:55,419
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, no, it's still recommended as urban residential 2, so it's recommended as urban residential 2 at the moment, but we could certainly consider happy to take input.

1511
02:29:55,439 --> 02:29:58,682
[SPEAKER_27]: That's part of what we've been asking for at the public meetings is

1512
02:29:59,402 --> 02:30:02,546
[SPEAKER_27]: additional input on, is a boundary in the right place?

1513
02:30:02,766 --> 02:30:07,952
[SPEAKER_27]: It's not just, A, are these the right uses and standards for the districts?

1514
02:30:08,052 --> 02:30:10,675
[SPEAKER_27]: But B is, are the boundaries in the right place?

1515
02:30:10,895 --> 02:30:13,138
[SPEAKER_27]: So this is helpful information for us to have.

1516
02:30:15,863 --> 02:30:17,883
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, thank you so much for this Melva.

1517
02:30:17,923 --> 02:30:30,826
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm looking at those, the homes that you mentioned, and it's definitely 51, 47, 43, which are going north of Harvard Ave, which have more of a home appearance to them.

1518
02:30:33,666 --> 02:30:35,447
[SPEAKER_14]: And then looking behind St.

1519
02:30:35,467 --> 02:30:42,028
[SPEAKER_14]: Raphael Parish School, there's a couple more

1520
02:30:44,115 --> 02:30:45,637
[SPEAKER_14]: home looking buildings.

1521
02:30:47,418 --> 02:30:49,060
[SPEAKER_14]: I do see that one of them has child care.

1522
02:30:49,480 --> 02:30:52,023
[SPEAKER_14]: So those are like home based child care.

1523
02:30:52,803 --> 02:30:56,147
[SPEAKER_14]: I believe that's permitted in residential right now.

1524
02:30:56,227 --> 02:30:58,189
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's not like a business business.

1525
02:30:59,029 --> 02:31:00,231
[SPEAKER_14]: So maybe it's kind of that

1526
02:31:00,967 --> 02:31:09,072
[SPEAKER_14]: Similar to what was done in the high street kind of curve, how those homes were pulled out.

1527
02:31:09,312 --> 02:31:16,377
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe those three homes are pulled out as well as, what is that?

1528
02:31:16,397 --> 02:31:23,442
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know what number, 38, potentially 38 Boston Ave.

1529
02:31:24,482 --> 02:31:25,263
[SPEAKER_14]: No, where does that?

1530
02:31:31,008 --> 02:31:33,690
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, so maybe like 38 Boston Ave to.

1531
02:31:34,731 --> 02:31:34,991
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

1532
02:31:35,011 --> 02:31:35,791
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that 24?

1533
02:31:36,412 --> 02:31:37,933
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe those are ones we revisit.

1534
02:31:39,994 --> 02:31:46,559
[SPEAKER_14]: In terms of like, is this is mixed use appropriate for that or do we cut it out and?

1535
02:31:48,660 --> 02:31:52,723
[SPEAKER_14]: Think through it as part of the residential zoning.

1536
02:31:57,706 --> 02:31:59,188
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, really great feedback.

1537
02:31:59,248 --> 02:31:59,508
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1538
02:32:06,465 --> 02:32:06,946
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1539
02:32:10,088 --> 02:32:17,795
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, I don't see any more Zoom commenters, but I want to provide a little bit of space just in case anybody was hesitant.

1540
02:32:20,558 --> 02:32:25,382
[SPEAKER_14]: Even if somebody has already said what you're planning to say, we would love to hear your comments.

1541
02:32:26,183 --> 02:32:27,404
[SPEAKER_14]: We do have a lot of emails.

1542
02:32:30,887 --> 02:32:31,708
[SPEAKER_14]: We do have a lot of...

1543
02:32:34,107 --> 02:32:38,770
[SPEAKER_14]: public that's already spoken, but please feel free to raise your hands.

1544
02:32:55,100 --> 02:32:55,720
[SPEAKER_14]: I got one more.

1545
02:32:57,221 --> 02:32:59,183
[SPEAKER_14]: Our next Zoom commenter is P.B.D.

1546
02:33:01,516 --> 02:33:02,956
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, this is Patricia Doherty.

1547
02:33:02,976 --> 02:33:06,098
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a question for you about something you were just referring to.

1548
02:33:08,718 --> 02:33:13,640
[SPEAKER_04]: On Harvard Ave, you said there were three homes there that were home-like.

1549
02:33:13,900 --> 02:33:15,041
[SPEAKER_04]: What did you mean by that?

1550
02:33:16,901 --> 02:33:24,384
[SPEAKER_14]: Just looking at the roof shape, they looked like they may have been residences at some point.

1551
02:33:24,544 --> 02:33:27,805
[SPEAKER_14]: They didn't have a flat roof like a lot of commercial buildings do.

1552
02:33:28,925 --> 02:33:31,226
[SPEAKER_14]: That's something that we'd have to look into and confirm.

1553
02:33:32,261 --> 02:33:34,982
[SPEAKER_04]: So why then would you think that they are not homes?

1554
02:33:37,603 --> 02:33:44,544
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I don't pretend to know the occupants of every single building in Medford.

1555
02:33:46,165 --> 02:33:46,805
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't mean that.

1556
02:33:46,845 --> 02:33:47,705
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a neighborhood.

1557
02:33:48,386 --> 02:33:49,406
[SPEAKER_04]: And it abuts St.

1558
02:33:49,466 --> 02:33:49,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Raphael's.

1559
02:33:50,026 --> 02:33:50,326
[SPEAKER_04]: And St.

1560
02:33:50,386 --> 02:33:52,607
[SPEAKER_04]: Raphael's does not own a lot of property there.

1561
02:33:52,967 --> 02:33:54,887
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a rectory that looks like a house.

1562
02:33:55,488 --> 02:34:00,469
[SPEAKER_04]: And they have a convent, which is

1563
02:34:01,412 --> 02:34:05,374
[SPEAKER_04]: maybe two and a half stories of a beige color brick.

1564
02:34:06,354 --> 02:34:13,637
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the rest of those homes are older Victorian single family homes, well kept.

1565
02:34:14,277 --> 02:34:19,439
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the residents would be horrified to find out that all of a sudden they could be in a

1566
02:34:23,004 --> 02:34:24,485
[SPEAKER_04]: higher density neighborhood.

1567
02:34:24,885 --> 02:34:37,593
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think anyone wants to find out that they can have three or five stories built next to their lovely Victorian, particularly the one that, I forget her name, Miss McDonald, I think it was mentioned.

1568
02:34:38,534 --> 02:34:41,115
[SPEAKER_04]: That is what's setting Medford on edge right now.

1569
02:34:41,635 --> 02:34:47,539
[SPEAKER_04]: These boundaries are blurring into residential neighborhoods and no one's paying attention to it.

1570
02:34:49,040 --> 02:34:50,221
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my comment, thank you.

1571
02:34:51,481 --> 02:34:52,182
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Patricia.

1572
02:34:57,608 --> 02:35:03,231
[SPEAKER_14]: And just to directly address that, that this is exactly why we do have public comment periods.

1573
02:35:03,251 --> 02:35:19,559
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, we are looking for specific feedback, like what your neighbor Milva very thoughtfully gave about those specific properties, which then kind of opened up the discussion to the rest of the homes that were in that same general area.

1574
02:35:20,772 --> 02:35:22,913
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, we're all humans here.

1575
02:35:23,133 --> 02:35:26,574
[SPEAKER_14]: We're all doing our best, including you all as the public.

1576
02:35:27,194 --> 02:35:47,500
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, we don't, you know, we're very thankful for the public comments that give us specific feedback, like 51 Harvard Ave, that allow us to dig into these zones a little bit deeper.

1577
02:35:50,585 --> 02:35:59,436
[SPEAKER_14]: Rather than being critical of the process, I'd encourage you to flag any additional properties that you think may warrant a second look.

1578
02:36:00,437 --> 02:36:01,539
[SPEAKER_14]: We're doing the same here.

1579
02:36:02,320 --> 02:36:03,221
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you for that.

1580
02:36:24,461 --> 02:36:26,664
[SPEAKER_14]: The next public commenter that I see is Michael DeBerry.

1581
02:36:26,684 --> 02:36:38,501
[SPEAKER_12]: Hello, Michael DeBerry, 50 Park Street.

1582
02:36:40,530 --> 02:36:44,052
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks for, yeah, for all the time put into this and the.

1583
02:36:44,932 --> 02:36:48,194
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, yet another meeting a series of long meetings.

1584
02:36:49,155 --> 02:36:53,738
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, I, uh, I wasn't going to talk, but I, I had some comments from the previous meeting.

1585
02:36:53,778 --> 02:36:55,019
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't get to deliver that.

1586
02:36:55,199 --> 02:37:01,422
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, I just saw that I wasn't going to share because they weren't relevant, but I just saw a hook for how they could be relevant.

1587
02:37:02,203 --> 02:37:08,127
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, I live in a, uh, as a part of Glenwood that is currently.

1588
02:37:09,167 --> 02:37:13,450
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, it's going to be zoned in our 3.

1589
02:37:14,391 --> 02:37:28,120
[SPEAKER_12]: And is already kind of at the, in our 3 maximum and we have, but directly a street that is, um, you are 2 and it's already like, you know, has 6, 8 unit buildings is already like, you're pretty close to the top of the top of the.

1590
02:37:29,065 --> 02:37:32,249
[SPEAKER_12]: The zoning and I think it's totally fine.

1591
02:37:32,289 --> 02:37:39,077
[SPEAKER_12]: I think a lot of the conversation of the past few weeks is like, acted like West Medford is some sort of beautiful utopia and.

1592
02:37:39,097 --> 02:37:43,842
[SPEAKER_12]: Good and what it needs, Benford is an apocalyptic hellscape and I think that is not true.

1593
02:37:43,902 --> 02:37:46,826
[SPEAKER_12]: Glenwood is still super beautiful with a mix of.

1594
02:37:48,328 --> 02:37:50,390
[SPEAKER_12]: single family homes and apartment buildings.

1595
02:37:50,731 --> 02:38:02,204
[SPEAKER_12]: I just wanted to say in response to the last comment that I'm not going to say whether all of Medford is or is not on edge, but there are definitely plenty of people who are encouraged to see density even next to their single family homes.

1596
02:38:02,925 --> 02:38:03,245
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1597
02:38:05,668 --> 02:38:06,289
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Michael.

1598
02:38:06,309 --> 02:38:07,130
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciate your comment.

1599
02:38:30,540 --> 02:38:32,462
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, so one last call for public comments.

1600
02:38:34,964 --> 02:38:42,170
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm only closing the public comment period for this meeting because we're going to go into board discussion.

1601
02:38:42,190 --> 02:38:51,859
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, so I'm closing the public comment period for this meeting.

1602
02:38:51,879 --> 02:38:51,919
[SPEAKER_14]: Um,

1603
02:38:56,876 --> 02:39:06,041
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, while I am eager to move things forward in zoning, so we don't get kind of stuck in a loop, I do see a lot of merit to

1604
02:39:08,058 --> 02:39:08,198
[SPEAKER_14]: Um.

1605
02:39:09,139 --> 02:39:13,062
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, taking more time with the square proposals with this board.

1606
02:39:13,082 --> 02:39:17,385
[SPEAKER_14]: We have a lot of questions that we're hearing that I think.

1607
02:39:17,406 --> 02:39:23,911
[SPEAKER_14]: It would just it would benefit us to have concrete answers to really thoughtful answers, too.

1608
02:39:25,072 --> 02:39:33,138
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think the In addition, well, so I think we have all the questions, some of which is around historic conversions.

1609
02:39:34,199 --> 02:39:34,299
[SPEAKER_14]: Um

1610
02:39:36,026 --> 02:39:40,952
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, we had a suggestion to add parking garages, permitted uses.

1611
02:39:41,492 --> 02:39:43,094
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, we've talked about exactions.

1612
02:39:43,194 --> 02:39:48,160
[SPEAKER_14]: We've talked about, you know, MX1 in Medford Square.

1613
02:39:48,180 --> 02:39:54,348
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, we just heard about a couple properties in West Medford, but I think

1614
02:39:56,867 --> 02:40:14,472
[SPEAKER_14]: maybe what we can do as a board to continue to move this forward is kind of discuss this high level concept and just, if we want to, if we as a board see that it's fit, confirm the removal of the residential areas from the boundaries, at least the ones that we've already removed.

1615
02:40:15,132 --> 02:40:24,575
[SPEAKER_14]: Sounds like we may be able to remove additional properties, but like just as theoretically,

1616
02:40:26,508 --> 02:40:38,330
[SPEAKER_14]: do we as a board like the idea of only talking about the mixed use prop or the commercial zones?

1617
02:40:38,950 --> 02:40:39,770
[SPEAKER_14]: Ben, I see your hand.

1618
02:40:42,791 --> 02:40:53,593
[SPEAKER_17]: I like the idea of reducing the scope of the square discussion to include only sort of appropriate mixed use and commercial type

1619
02:40:55,361 --> 02:41:02,246
[SPEAKER_17]: Areas, I think we're closer on Medford Square than we are on West Medford Square on that front.

1620
02:41:02,266 --> 02:41:04,347
[SPEAKER_17]: I actually think on Medford Square we're quite close.

1621
02:41:04,528 --> 02:41:17,397
[SPEAKER_17]: I would add 17 Garden Street in Medford Square to the list of parcels that we should probably take out and sort of put in the neighborhood residential zoning bucket.

1622
02:41:18,198 --> 02:41:23,262
[SPEAKER_17]: It's like one or two houses on Garden Street kind of next to the pure hockey parking lot.

1623
02:41:24,070 --> 02:41:27,711
[SPEAKER_17]: that are very clearly historic homes.

1624
02:41:28,691 --> 02:41:36,373
[SPEAKER_17]: And in my mind, if we're gonna remove the others and put those in our bucket, we should do the same for a couple of houses on Garden Street.

1625
02:41:36,753 --> 02:41:50,337
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think, per the public comment today, there's a handful, probably a dozen or a couple dozen parcels in West Medford Square that we should take another look at.

1626
02:41:51,086 --> 02:41:56,129
[SPEAKER_17]: and see if they're more appropriately categorized in the neighborhood residential bucket.

1627
02:41:56,149 --> 02:42:11,076
[SPEAKER_17]: So yeah, all of that is a long winded way of me saying I would like to approve the updated boundaries and maybe, you know, take sort of one final pass there and then really kind of finalize those boundaries and move us into a situation where we can take some action.

1628
02:42:13,241 --> 02:42:37,876
[SPEAKER_17]: While I have the floor, if that's okay, Emily, I'll just finish my other bit of feedback that I was going to share in a few minutes, which is I think we should, again, in response to the public feedback and the fact that everybody's been sort of so overwhelmed with the volume of changes and the sort of, I appreciated your point, Emily, that we should all sort of assume good intentions and participate in the process here.

1629
02:42:38,076 --> 02:42:40,217
[SPEAKER_17]: And the public feedback has been super, super valuable.

1630
02:42:40,237 --> 02:42:40,918
[SPEAKER_17]: I think, you know,

1631
02:42:42,458 --> 02:42:52,868
[SPEAKER_17]: taking a good last turn at the maps, trimming a couple of parcels here and there to make sure we get the boundaries 100% right.

1632
02:42:52,908 --> 02:42:58,693
[SPEAKER_17]: I think we're much closer to that now than we were in the past, so I appreciate the effort.

1633
02:42:59,234 --> 02:43:01,396
[SPEAKER_17]: And then doing a very deliberate

1634
02:43:02,168 --> 02:43:09,973
[SPEAKER_17]: public distribution of the final version of that, you know, several days a week in advance, nice bright colors.

1635
02:43:10,073 --> 02:43:17,138
[SPEAKER_17]: I think some of the stuff that we have now sort of has NR and squares sort of on the same page.

1636
02:43:17,178 --> 02:43:25,684
[SPEAKER_17]: We can gray everything out that's neighborhood residential and really just make the square proposals super, super clear for people.

1637
02:43:26,985 --> 02:43:27,825
[SPEAKER_17]: I think we're getting there.

1638
02:43:28,566 --> 02:43:30,447
[SPEAKER_17]: So that would be my feedback on next steps.

1639
02:43:32,175 --> 02:43:33,136
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, totally agree there.

1640
02:43:33,356 --> 02:43:47,624
[SPEAKER_14]: And Emily and Paola, before you write your resignation letters to the city, we would make sure that the deadlines work, because we want to make sure that you're producing like meaningful work, just as we're, you know, receiving meaningful work.

1641
02:43:47,704 --> 02:43:52,387
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you know, we can talk more about what those those timelines look like.

1642
02:43:54,523 --> 02:44:06,607
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so any other thoughts from board members around kind of removing the residential from boundaries plus a deeper dive into the map?

1643
02:44:09,187 --> 02:44:11,248
[SPEAKER_14]: It seems like we're all kind of on the same page with that.

1644
02:44:13,129 --> 02:44:20,573
[SPEAKER_14]: So what I want to talk about now is the specific questions and topics we want to address the next time we see this in front of us.

1645
02:44:21,454 --> 02:44:33,160
[SPEAKER_14]: And this could be for, I think some of these topics are valid for maybe only Medford Square and West Medford, but a lot of these topics are valid for all of the zoning reform that's being proposed.

1646
02:44:34,721 --> 02:44:36,002
[SPEAKER_14]: So my short list.

1647
02:44:38,008 --> 02:44:43,012
[SPEAKER_14]: is what does this mean for city services?

1648
02:44:43,913 --> 02:44:46,955
[SPEAKER_14]: People specifically mentioned power, water, sewer, schools.

1649
02:44:49,757 --> 02:44:53,760
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think we can review public comment, maybe add a couple more to that list.

1650
02:44:55,541 --> 02:44:58,964
[SPEAKER_14]: I think there's some poking we need to do at historic conversions.

1651
02:44:59,805 --> 02:45:04,448
[SPEAKER_14]: What's the right year for us to select, if any?

1652
02:45:04,468 --> 02:45:06,330
[SPEAKER_14]: In addition,

1653
02:45:09,203 --> 02:45:10,444
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, who was it?

1654
02:45:10,884 --> 02:45:18,910
[SPEAKER_14]: One of the public commenters kind of brought up the potential for exploitation around these historic conversions and like, um.

1655
02:45:20,131 --> 02:45:22,673
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, really nailing down like the legal definitions there.

1656
02:45:22,693 --> 02:45:24,314
[SPEAKER_14]: I agree with that.

1657
02:45:24,654 --> 02:45:25,655
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that would be helpful.

1658
02:45:26,035 --> 02:45:31,619
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe look at, you know any precedents of other communities that have done something like this, you know, talk to their staff.

1659
02:45:31,659 --> 02:45:32,500
[SPEAKER_14]: Where is it going right?

1660
02:45:32,520 --> 02:45:33,361
[SPEAKER_14]: Where is it going wrong?

1661
02:45:34,522 --> 02:45:37,564
[SPEAKER_14]: Um and specifically for West Medford and Medford Square.

1662
02:45:39,290 --> 02:45:46,657
[SPEAKER_14]: looking at the age of the structures within those zones, is this a germane topic for those squares?

1663
02:45:47,037 --> 02:45:55,565
[SPEAKER_14]: Or is this something that we need to focus more on with the residential neighborhood and urban residential rezoning?

1664
02:45:59,865 --> 02:46:19,801
[SPEAKER_14]: I also think some education on exactions, meaning what fees do developers need to pay to Medford as it stands now, which were last updated 35 years ago, and maybe what the city's thinking moving forward.

1665
02:46:27,922 --> 02:46:32,669
[SPEAKER_14]: Kind of look through my notes, but I encourage other board members to kind of add to that list.

1666
02:46:37,636 --> 02:46:39,539
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm looking through my public comment notes as well.

1667
02:46:43,144 --> 02:46:43,545
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

1668
02:46:56,103 --> 02:46:58,104
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, there's some questions about, um.

1669
02:46:59,645 --> 02:47:01,946
[SPEAKER_14]: Affordable housing, maybe some education on that.

1670
02:47:03,727 --> 02:47:04,728
[SPEAKER_14]: Would be beneficial.

1671
02:47:15,073 --> 02:47:16,614
[SPEAKER_14]: The land that was that was

1672
02:47:27,078 --> 02:47:29,250
[SPEAKER_14]: possibility for greater density, greater height there.

1673
02:47:40,727 --> 02:47:50,375
[SPEAKER_14]: And then as stated by Ben, as well as a few public commenters, I think just being mindful of the timeline in terms of when we distribute this information.

1674
02:47:50,395 --> 02:48:03,426
[SPEAKER_14]: I know we're putting together a lot of requests now, but I think giving the board and the public at least a couple of days to review information would be good.

1675
02:48:03,886 --> 02:48:07,149
[SPEAKER_14]: And Emily and Paula, we look to you to help us influence those timelines.

1676
02:48:34,045 --> 02:48:35,366
[SPEAKER_14]: board members, what else are you thinking?

1677
02:48:40,709 --> 02:48:40,929
[SPEAKER_13]: Adam.

1678
02:48:45,311 --> 02:48:48,413
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi.

1679
02:48:49,353 --> 02:49:01,180
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe I'm just thinking that general comments, it's not anything specific for like a recommendation, but maybe one thing that we could do better as a board as well is

1680
02:49:02,128 --> 02:49:08,391
[SPEAKER_16]: just kind of continually reframe like zoning, where zoning sits in sort of like the process of everything.

1681
02:49:09,491 --> 02:49:20,316
[SPEAKER_16]: And so for me, the helpful thing of a lot of like the zoning recommendations is that Medford put a lot of effort into the comprehensive plan and a vision for what we want the city to be.

1682
02:49:21,396 --> 02:49:27,399
[SPEAKER_16]: That was really informed through kind of the public election process.

1683
02:49:28,688 --> 02:49:41,838
[SPEAKER_16]: And that the zoning, at least the way that I understand the zoning and at least like my role as well, is that this is a lot of the specifics that are kind of meant to further that objective.

1684
02:49:42,118 --> 02:49:54,347
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not meant that like, oh, the zoning team and this board is pushing kind of our own agenda for how we think Medford should be developed.

1685
02:49:55,369 --> 02:50:05,797
[SPEAKER_16]: but that it's an attempt to get to the specific detail that has been sort of outlined sort of in tandem with the public over the past four years.

1686
02:50:07,379 --> 02:50:16,266
[SPEAKER_16]: And so I hear a lot of the comments about the process feeling rushed or being caught off guard or this or, you know, kind of that.

1687
02:50:16,386 --> 02:50:18,608
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think I have a hard time

1688
02:50:20,421 --> 02:50:25,458
[SPEAKER_16]: With that, just because, and I apologize, I have a puppy that's making noise in the background, but.

1689
02:50:27,465 --> 02:50:38,970
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I have a hard time with that just because this is in the context of kind of four years of conversation that I think the city has been very proactive about.

1690
02:50:39,650 --> 02:50:56,298
[SPEAKER_16]: And so while the exact details might not have been sort of outlined in terms of the exact specific building height of an exact specific street, that's maybe to reiterate that this process is to get to the detail level,

1691
02:50:56,958 --> 02:51:05,755
[SPEAKER_16]: But it's not like we're going out on a limb and saying, you know, out of nowhere, we want to change the like nature of this square.

1692
02:51:05,795 --> 02:51:07,879
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's just the thing that's kind of top of mind.

1693
02:51:07,959 --> 02:51:08,841
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry for the long comment.

1694
02:51:10,208 --> 02:51:11,269
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I think that's a great point.

1695
02:51:12,449 --> 02:51:18,211
[SPEAKER_14]: And yeah, I mean, the comprehensive plan was kicked off June 9th, 2021.

1696
02:51:18,251 --> 02:51:23,454
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm reading from the website right now, so I got my facts right.

1697
02:51:24,374 --> 02:51:27,395
[SPEAKER_14]: It was expected to take 12 to 18 months.

1698
02:51:28,856 --> 02:51:30,957
[SPEAKER_14]: There was a 21 person steering committee.

1699
02:51:32,684 --> 02:51:36,631
[SPEAKER_14]: They met six times over the course of the 18-month planning process.

1700
02:51:37,372 --> 02:51:40,638
[SPEAKER_14]: They served as liaisons between community groups, planning teams.

1701
02:51:41,660 --> 02:51:45,707
[SPEAKER_14]: So, yes, this isn't coming out of nowhere.

1702
02:51:48,245 --> 02:52:04,475
[SPEAKER_14]: But also, I do recognize the anxiety and kind of, I don't think fear is the right word because I think what we've heard at most of our meetings is people want, you know, Medford to grow and to kind of realize its full potential but

1703
02:52:08,392 --> 02:52:11,112
[SPEAKER_14]: they wanna feel more engaged in the process.

1704
02:52:11,453 --> 02:52:34,256
[SPEAKER_14]: So, yes, I agree, this is not something that the board kind of steamed up, but we also need to kind of be very responsive to the people that this is gonna impact, which is us as Bedford residents on the board, but the larger community.

1705
02:52:34,556 --> 02:52:37,317
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think it is the balance and I think you bring up a great point.

1706
02:52:38,911 --> 02:52:50,575
[SPEAKER_14]: that there's the zoning specifics in the short term, but then this long plan that we've been talking about for a long time now.

1707
02:52:52,756 --> 02:52:53,796
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, well said.

1708
02:53:00,018 --> 02:53:00,919
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, John, sorry.

1709
02:53:01,759 --> 02:53:02,419
[SPEAKER_02]: That's OK.

1710
02:53:03,139 --> 02:53:05,140
[SPEAKER_02]: You're hiding behind your computer over there.

1711
02:53:07,546 --> 02:53:09,988
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna take another look at the comprehensive plan.

1712
02:53:10,268 --> 02:53:13,491
[SPEAKER_02]: I read it a couple of weeks ago quickly.

1713
02:53:16,193 --> 02:53:33,866
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's a difference though between saying all the things we search for in the comprehensive plan, you know, grow the city, be more diverse, a welcoming place, all sorts of good stuff in there.

1714
02:53:35,385 --> 02:53:41,248
[SPEAKER_02]: But it didn't say anywhere that we wanted to densify the entire city.

1715
02:53:42,588 --> 02:53:45,730
[SPEAKER_02]: It said we needed, maybe I'm wrong, maybe it did say that.

1716
02:53:49,511 --> 02:54:01,176
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a difference between saying we need to provide more housing options and saying we want to change all the single family neighborhoods to three family neighborhoods.

1717
02:54:01,637 --> 02:54:04,598
[SPEAKER_02]: That's more of a strategy and

1718
02:54:06,860 --> 02:54:11,502
[SPEAKER_02]: While everybody's on board about providing more housing, it's how you do it.

1719
02:54:14,023 --> 02:54:16,664
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, mixed use is a great way of doing it.

1720
02:54:18,825 --> 02:54:33,652
[SPEAKER_02]: New developments like the one near BJ's, there are all sorts of places where we're providing more housing and

1721
02:54:35,682 --> 02:54:37,363
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's look at that too.

1722
02:54:37,383 --> 02:54:44,945
[SPEAKER_02]: And as I say, I didn't see the comprehensive plan being so specific about what we're talking about now.

1723
02:54:44,965 --> 02:54:53,768
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry if I'm being a little bit incoherent.

1724
02:54:53,808 --> 02:54:54,628
[SPEAKER_02]: It is getting late.

1725
02:54:55,284 --> 02:54:57,245
[SPEAKER_14]: No, no, no, I think better.

1726
02:54:57,285 --> 02:54:58,705
[SPEAKER_14]: I think you're bringing up a great point.

1727
02:54:58,765 --> 02:55:10,428
[SPEAKER_14]: And it kind of an Adam, please correct me if I if I say this wrong, but it kind of harkens back to Adam's point in that, you know, the comprehensive plan spoken generalities, and non specifics.

1728
02:55:11,369 --> 02:55:11,709
[SPEAKER_14]: And then

1729
02:55:13,089 --> 02:55:19,790
[SPEAKER_14]: that work went to what, the planning and permitting committee, right?

1730
02:55:19,810 --> 02:55:25,232
[SPEAKER_14]: They came up with specifics that went to city council, and then it came to us.

1731
02:55:26,232 --> 02:55:29,253
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's our job to kind of nail down those specifics.

1732
02:55:29,853 --> 02:55:40,655
[SPEAKER_14]: So while the comprehensive plan was not prescriptive, now is the time for us to achieve that level of specificity

1733
02:55:42,157 --> 02:55:44,358
[SPEAKER_14]: with the guidance of the comprehensive plan.

1734
02:55:46,338 --> 02:56:02,842
[SPEAKER_14]: And if your perspective is, John, that certain neighborhoods should not have any additional density, then that's an opinion that you have the prerogative to express.

1735
02:56:03,802 --> 02:56:06,183
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not actually saying that.

1736
02:56:06,423 --> 02:56:06,503
[SPEAKER_14]: OK.

1737
02:56:08,083 --> 02:56:19,313
[SPEAKER_02]: I do recall in the comprehensive plan that one of the criteria was that the history and general character of neighborhoods needed to be preserved.

1738
02:56:21,275 --> 02:56:27,261
[SPEAKER_14]: Just before we get too deep into this, is this something that we would want to maybe

1739
02:56:28,453 --> 02:56:32,797
[SPEAKER_14]: bring back up when we talk about the neighborhood and urban residential discussion.

1740
02:56:32,817 --> 02:56:37,622
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, because I just want to make sure we're having the right conversation in front of the right group.

1741
02:56:37,642 --> 02:56:43,347
[SPEAKER_14]: Because if we talk about this and people didn't expect us to, then we're not, we're not doing right by the public.

1742
02:56:43,547 --> 02:56:46,050
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think this is an important conversation for us to have.

1743
02:56:46,670 --> 02:56:48,492
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just trying to make the general point.

1744
02:56:49,263 --> 02:56:58,867
[SPEAKER_02]: that we have, I think we have a responsibility to do more than just be very specific about what we've been handed.

1745
02:57:00,228 --> 02:57:00,508
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1746
02:57:02,549 --> 02:57:03,369
[SPEAKER_14]: Adam, I see your hand.

1747
02:57:05,290 --> 02:57:15,655
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, just to respond to John, at least like when I look, just a cursory search, densities mentioned about 70 times in the comprehensive plan.

1748
02:57:17,272 --> 02:57:29,299
[SPEAKER_16]: There's a section at the end that specifically goes through each corridor and area, talking about ways in which those corridors and areas could be improved.

1749
02:57:30,119 --> 02:57:42,066
[SPEAKER_16]: And while it's not specific to the level of zoning, it is directionally towards a denser city.

1750
02:57:42,266 --> 02:57:45,168
[SPEAKER_16]: So I just wanted to call out that specific point,

1751
02:57:47,364 --> 02:57:52,086
[SPEAKER_16]: I also hear the point, too, of that's the part of zoning is to get to the detail level.

1752
02:57:53,107 --> 02:57:54,027
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you're correct.

1753
02:57:59,770 --> 02:58:12,175
[SPEAKER_14]: So in terms of what our next steps are for this evening, what I'm generally feeling is that we're not ready to recommend this back to the City Council and refer this back to the City Council.

1754
02:58:14,325 --> 02:58:21,681
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think we are, as a board, aligned with the removal of residential from these boundaries.

1755
02:58:28,453 --> 02:58:37,259
[SPEAKER_14]: Were there any additional topics that we wanted to include as part of the discussions for the next iteration?

1756
02:58:37,899 --> 02:58:48,326
[SPEAKER_06]: Madam Chair, while you were listing the things that you wanted a bit more information, the staff reminded me that also the daylight minimum

1757
02:58:49,426 --> 02:58:58,432
[SPEAKER_06]: that that either should be flushed out or we should remove it, but having something hanging saying TBD in an actual approved zone and wouldn't actually be great.

1758
02:59:00,253 --> 02:59:01,553
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think, wait, there was one other.

1759
02:59:01,573 --> 02:59:05,235
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah, it's just that one.

1760
02:59:05,736 --> 02:59:06,616
[SPEAKER_06]: The daylight standards.

1761
02:59:07,137 --> 02:59:12,820
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so the daylight standards, adding parking garages as permitted uses in the table.

1762
02:59:18,792 --> 02:59:27,543
[SPEAKER_14]: Sounds like there's a couple of specific properties in West Medford, Medford Square, as well as along High Street that need a second look.

1763
02:59:30,957 --> 02:59:32,918
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse me, can I ask a question?

1764
02:59:33,318 --> 02:59:34,699
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, John, sorry.

1765
02:59:34,739 --> 02:59:43,182
[SPEAKER_02]: We responded to specific comments by people in neighborhoods who recognized a particular building and said that shouldn't be part of the square.

1766
02:59:43,602 --> 02:59:57,168
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have a process to actually do a quick look on these properties and to determine whether or not they are indeed more properly residential than in one of the squares?

1767
02:59:58,681 --> 03:00:01,543
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, like drive by and look at them or something?

1768
03:00:02,723 --> 03:00:05,545
[SPEAKER_14]: So those properties that I mentioned on Harvard Ave.

1769
03:00:05,785 --> 03:00:06,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1770
03:00:06,286 --> 03:00:06,626
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1771
03:00:06,906 --> 03:00:15,551
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, there are other sort of blue areas as well, non-purple blue areas.

1772
03:00:17,672 --> 03:00:20,074
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think there's several methods.

1773
03:00:21,555 --> 03:00:22,976
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a visual check.

1774
03:00:23,116 --> 03:00:26,318
[SPEAKER_14]: There's database checks.

1775
03:00:26,538 --> 03:00:27,899
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to make sure that we're applying

1776
03:00:29,962 --> 03:00:36,609
[SPEAKER_14]: equitable kind of standards as we look at these things, as we look at these properties.

1777
03:00:37,710 --> 03:00:42,194
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's going to be part of my homework over the next X number of weeks.

1778
03:00:42,955 --> 03:00:45,498
[SPEAKER_14]: We haven't picked a date to continue this too.

1779
03:00:47,183 --> 03:00:58,158
[SPEAKER_14]: But, you know, I would consider, you know, members of the board that are maybe more familiar with areas, you know, Bennett, it sounds like Medford Square, you know, Ari, it sounds like you live near Medford Square.

1780
03:00:58,178 --> 03:01:04,267
[SPEAKER_14]: So I would say, you know, take a walk around.

1781
03:01:06,682 --> 03:01:08,422
[SPEAKER_14]: if you haven't already, I hope you have.

1782
03:01:11,643 --> 03:01:20,905
[SPEAKER_14]: And, uh, yeah, let's kind of poke and prod this thing until we feel like we've we've done our due diligence and done right by the public.

1783
03:01:20,925 --> 03:01:28,227
[SPEAKER_06]: Madam Chair, as we start to look at specifics, um, we

1784
03:01:29,507 --> 03:01:42,077
[SPEAKER_06]: have already scheduled a hybrid meeting for July 9th to hear continued public hearing on residential and said there wouldn't be any new residential information presented, but this meeting could be continued to that.

1785
03:01:42,537 --> 03:01:45,760
[SPEAKER_06]: And I will share that I have confirmed that our DPW Commissioner

1786
03:01:46,320 --> 03:02:04,807
[SPEAKER_06]: Tim McGivern could join us on July 9th with the idea that he could answer some questions, easy questions in person at the time, and then help us frame harder questions for him that he would be happy to provide all of his answers in writing by August 6th so that the board would then have that information.

1787
03:02:04,867 --> 03:02:11,790
[SPEAKER_06]: And maybe we could ask him to make it like August 1st so that you'd have it several days before the meeting for August.

1788
03:02:13,705 --> 03:02:32,515
[SPEAKER_14]: So what I'm thinking when the July 9th date is, you know, thinking about what we're asking of Emily and Paola, keeping in mind that the July 4th holiday is coming up, is that giving enough time to potentially update?

1789
03:02:34,016 --> 03:02:38,999
[SPEAKER_14]: First, we would have to identify the specific properties that we want to pull out.

1790
03:02:42,536 --> 03:02:46,338
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, and I know you guys can't be here, Emily.

1791
03:02:48,199 --> 03:02:49,139
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

1792
03:02:49,179 --> 03:02:50,340
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, that is correct.

1793
03:02:50,400 --> 03:02:59,405
[SPEAKER_27]: And neither Paula nor I can be here on the 9th, although one of our colleagues will be listening to the residential discussion and taking notes on our behalf.

1794
03:03:00,085 --> 03:03:09,650
[SPEAKER_27]: I think also, I love the idea of Tim McGovern being able to answer some of the questions as Director Hunt mentioned.

1795
03:03:10,350 --> 03:03:19,738
[SPEAKER_27]: I think we also did not want to introduce any new information on any topic for July 9th, because we know how important that public session is.

1796
03:03:19,758 --> 03:03:26,643
[SPEAKER_27]: I believe your next meeting is August 6th, as Director Hunt said.

1797
03:03:27,504 --> 03:03:33,489
[SPEAKER_27]: August 1st might be a nice deadline for us as well to respond to anything

1798
03:03:35,690 --> 03:03:43,617
[SPEAKER_27]: in advance of the August 6 deadline, our August 6 meeting, so I think we could have something available for that.

1799
03:03:44,285 --> 03:04:05,043
[SPEAKER_27]: And what might be helpful is if the board does choose to have this put towards the July 9th meeting, that perhaps that would give you all an opportunity to provide us with any additional direction that we could then make sure that we've answered by August 1st.

1800
03:04:08,486 --> 03:04:10,288
[SPEAKER_27]: And I think that would be very helpful for us.

1801
03:04:11,930 --> 03:04:13,151
[SPEAKER_14]: That sounds reasonable to me.

1802
03:04:14,232 --> 03:04:15,513
[SPEAKER_14]: What other board members think?

1803
03:04:16,875 --> 03:04:23,601
[SPEAKER_14]: So that would be us clarifying some direction on the specific parcels that we've talked about.

1804
03:04:25,703 --> 03:04:25,943
[SPEAKER_14]: Ben?

1805
03:04:27,824 --> 03:04:29,586
[SPEAKER_17]: That timeline sounds reasonable to me.

1806
03:04:29,726 --> 03:04:35,371
[SPEAKER_17]: I think we should give ourselves a deadline for anybody that has input on specific parcels.

1807
03:04:36,436 --> 03:04:47,301
[SPEAKER_17]: to sort of send those to, we should also identify exactly how we should submit that feedback so that people aren't getting it from multiple channels, which can be hard to keep up with.

1808
03:04:48,882 --> 03:04:59,427
[SPEAKER_17]: We should give ourselves a deadline that then gives Innos associates plenty of time to process that feedback, create a nice, rich final proposal that can then get distributed, you know,

1809
03:05:00,623 --> 03:05:03,205
[SPEAKER_17]: a week, like I appreciate the August 1st deadline.

1810
03:05:03,285 --> 03:05:06,947
[SPEAKER_17]: I would say we should give ourselves an earlier deadline than that, right?

1811
03:05:07,327 --> 03:05:13,231
[SPEAKER_17]: Like our feedback's due to NS, you know, whatever, call it three weeks from now.

1812
03:05:14,892 --> 03:05:17,994
[SPEAKER_17]: They have 10 days to process it.

1813
03:05:18,374 --> 03:05:20,575
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I'm just sort of spitballing dates here.

1814
03:05:21,115 --> 03:05:28,220
[SPEAKER_17]: And then there's like a PR push and an aggressive distribution of that material.

1815
03:05:29,086 --> 03:05:32,849
[SPEAKER_17]: in nice crisp format so that people have a lot of time to process it.

1816
03:05:33,930 --> 03:05:38,494
[SPEAKER_17]: And then, you know, we move forward in August, hopefully.

1817
03:05:39,915 --> 03:05:44,539
[SPEAKER_06]: Just to be clear, the intention was not to have new material from Innis on August 6th.

1818
03:05:44,739 --> 03:05:48,182
[SPEAKER_06]: It was for the board to give direction to Innis on August 6th.

1819
03:05:48,282 --> 03:05:49,583
[SPEAKER_06]: For the residential.

1820
03:05:49,603 --> 03:05:49,723
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1821
03:05:52,332 --> 03:05:54,014
[SPEAKER_17]: No, I was referring to the squares here.

1822
03:05:54,134 --> 03:05:56,756
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe it's just I'm getting confused.

1823
03:05:57,397 --> 03:06:00,600
[SPEAKER_17]: I was referring specifically to feedback about the squares.

1824
03:06:01,948 --> 03:06:02,708
[SPEAKER_06]: we're going to have a public hearing.

1825
03:06:02,748 --> 03:06:06,909
[SPEAKER_06]: And the other thing that we just want to put into the mix is that the.

1826
03:06:07,630 --> 03:06:17,272
[SPEAKER_06]: Corridors are going to get referred out by the City Council, most likely July 15th and we have to open that public hearing within 21 days.

1827
03:06:18,092 --> 03:06:22,174
[SPEAKER_06]: Of them referring it so the expectation was that it would open.

1828
03:06:32,881 --> 03:06:33,101
[SPEAKER_14]: questions.

1829
03:06:33,121 --> 03:06:33,321
[SPEAKER_14]: Danielle.

1830
03:06:34,502 --> 03:06:35,062
[SPEAKER_08]: Madam chair.

1831
03:06:35,102 --> 03:06:35,483
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1832
03:06:35,963 --> 03:06:45,809
[SPEAKER_08]: I think this really, um, underlines that the pace of the amendments being referred to this board is just too fast.

1833
03:06:46,009 --> 03:06:46,810
[SPEAKER_08]: It's too fast.

1834
03:06:46,950 --> 03:06:47,590
[SPEAKER_08]: It's too fast.

1835
03:06:47,670 --> 03:06:48,511
[SPEAKER_08]: We can't keep up.

1836
03:06:48,591 --> 03:06:49,992
[SPEAKER_08]: The consultants can't keep up.

1837
03:06:50,132 --> 03:06:52,053
[SPEAKER_08]: No, the public can't keep up.

1838
03:06:53,134 --> 03:06:53,294
[SPEAKER_08]: We're

1839
03:07:00,018 --> 03:07:00,338
[SPEAKER_08]: it would just be.

1840
03:07:00,358 --> 03:07:02,239
[SPEAKER_08]: Any site plan review projects before us.

1841
03:07:02,460 --> 03:07:03,260
[SPEAKER_08]: It would just be.

1842
03:07:03,280 --> 03:07:05,742
[SPEAKER_08]: I know it's just thinking the other day.

1843
03:07:05,782 --> 03:07:06,162
[SPEAKER_08]: It's too.

1844
03:07:06,262 --> 03:07:07,042
[SPEAKER_08]: It's too much.

1845
03:07:07,163 --> 03:07:07,963
[SPEAKER_08]: I understand.

1846
03:07:07,983 --> 03:07:09,344
[SPEAKER_08]: So what can we do about it?

1847
03:07:09,584 --> 03:07:11,645
[SPEAKER_14]: And I should write a letter to City Council.

1848
03:07:11,866 --> 03:07:16,989
[SPEAKER_08]: I would kindly request that they do not refer another

1849
03:07:25,088 --> 03:07:29,610
[SPEAKER_08]: as staff, I just can't even conceive of doing this all if the meetings are too long.

1850
03:07:29,630 --> 03:07:38,953
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it's I mean, I'm thinking about like the dependencies between the different amendments.

1851
03:07:39,314 --> 03:07:48,857
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think the way we've kind of sectioned out these squares as with like a commercial and mixed use focus from the neighborhood residential makes sense.

1852
03:07:49,497 --> 03:07:50,618
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm trying to think is there

1853
03:07:52,416 --> 03:07:57,880
[SPEAKER_14]: like, is that severing of the connection between the corridors?

1854
03:07:59,121 --> 03:08:12,191
[SPEAKER_14]: And because it'd be severed, not severed, but like, if we if we say do not refer anything else until we get through, because right now we have ADU, residential, squares,

1855
03:08:14,683 --> 03:08:16,785
[SPEAKER_14]: What else is in my head?

1856
03:08:16,885 --> 03:08:17,225
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that it?

1857
03:08:18,546 --> 03:08:20,227
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, the quarters hasn't been referred yet, though.

1858
03:08:20,447 --> 03:08:20,688
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1859
03:08:21,888 --> 03:08:31,215
[SPEAKER_08]: As soon as they refer, you have 21 days to open the public hearing or you forfeit your, I think, ability to even review it.

1860
03:08:31,436 --> 03:08:37,900
[SPEAKER_14]: And I feel like at that point, we're kind of forfeiting the public's ability to review it, because this is where we get such rich, deep, specific information.

1861
03:08:37,920 --> 03:08:39,602
[SPEAKER_14]: And I don't want to lose that opportunity.

1862
03:08:39,642 --> 03:08:42,063
[SPEAKER_14]: We can't review it in depth enough.

1863
03:08:42,324 --> 03:08:43,785
[SPEAKER_14]: It's too much.

1864
03:08:45,126 --> 03:08:47,907
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, okay, that's a good follow-up item.

1865
03:08:49,388 --> 03:08:50,769
[SPEAKER_14]: Tell city council to chill.

1866
03:08:57,212 --> 03:08:58,092
[SPEAKER_14]: In more formal terms.

1867
03:09:02,154 --> 03:09:10,138
[SPEAKER_14]: But if that's moving forward, how do we deal with the matter in front of us today, which is the squares?

1868
03:09:15,464 --> 03:09:31,054
[SPEAKER_06]: If we don't have the corridors on the sixth and just doing feedback to the consultant on the residential, so that wouldn't be new material to review it would be the board saying we've heard all this comment this is what we changes, it would be just the deliberation.

1869
03:09:32,054 --> 03:09:57,413
[SPEAKER_06]: and then and we've already that's what we said in the last meeting right and that's what the plan was and if we didn't have the public the corridors just doing this continued hearing because honestly i feel like medford square is pretty close to ready like there's very little to change there there's a little consideration and there's some details in this and west medford square is getting there and what we're talking about now is about six weeks from now

1870
03:09:58,333 --> 03:10:00,974
[SPEAKER_06]: Remind me, did we introduce those as two separate topics?

1871
03:10:01,854 --> 03:10:02,554
[SPEAKER_06]: Or one topic?

1872
03:10:02,574 --> 03:10:03,875
[SPEAKER_06]: Medford Square and West Medford?

1873
03:10:03,895 --> 03:10:04,155
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1874
03:10:04,335 --> 03:10:06,736
[SPEAKER_06]: They were sent together as one paper.

1875
03:10:07,016 --> 03:10:08,977
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so we have to... Can we approve?

1876
03:10:08,997 --> 03:10:09,637
[SPEAKER_06]: We could sever it.

1877
03:10:10,177 --> 03:10:10,437
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1878
03:10:10,657 --> 03:10:14,798
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know why we would hold up Medford Square, right?

1879
03:10:15,859 --> 03:10:16,119
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1880
03:10:16,139 --> 03:10:20,400
[SPEAKER_08]: Because we can't make West Medford... Because we still have more work to do.

1881
03:10:20,460 --> 03:10:21,281
[SPEAKER_06]: We need more time on that one.

1882
03:10:21,301 --> 03:10:25,402
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, looking at it more closely, I see several parcels I'd like to see

1883
03:10:26,292 --> 03:10:31,014
[SPEAKER_08]: not included in the MX and I'd like to see some density reduction.

1884
03:10:31,034 --> 03:10:34,675
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, the pace of the amendments coming our way.

1885
03:10:35,636 --> 03:10:38,137
[SPEAKER_08]: I've not been able to just really study these.

1886
03:10:38,297 --> 03:10:43,159
[SPEAKER_08]: And I also, I think that everyone needs to go in and look at all these parcels.

1887
03:10:43,199 --> 03:10:50,441
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I walk up and down streets, I've changed my jogging routes so that I can see the actual neighborhoods.

1888
03:10:50,662 --> 03:10:54,083
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not just two dimensional plans

1889
03:10:56,039 --> 03:10:58,281
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to really understand them.

1890
03:10:58,421 --> 03:10:58,581
[SPEAKER_08]: It's.

1891
03:11:00,163 --> 03:11:01,063
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, no, I agree.

1892
03:11:01,464 --> 03:11:07,148
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, I'm tired, so I'm starting to lose my filter.

1893
03:11:07,168 --> 03:11:08,770
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciate it, Danielle.

1894
03:11:09,450 --> 03:11:11,352
[SPEAKER_14]: You always have good insight, so thank you for that.

1895
03:11:18,998 --> 03:11:19,419
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think.

1896
03:11:21,548 --> 03:11:23,630
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me see my Zoom.

1897
03:11:24,550 --> 03:11:25,151
[SPEAKER_14]: I had my Zoom.

1898
03:11:25,271 --> 03:11:33,136
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so what I'm hearing is that we're going to continue this topic, Medford Square and West Medford to a date certain.

1899
03:11:34,257 --> 03:11:35,698
[SPEAKER_14]: We're still talking about what date.

1900
03:11:37,800 --> 03:11:42,903
[SPEAKER_14]: We may sever them, but I think based on what we're hearing today, we can

1901
03:11:47,859 --> 03:11:56,085
[SPEAKER_14]: Lastly, are there any board members that think either of the squares is ready to refer back to city council at this point?

1902
03:11:57,907 --> 03:11:58,807
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think there are.

1903
03:11:59,568 --> 03:12:00,629
[SPEAKER_14]: I think there's work to do on both.

1904
03:12:01,890 --> 03:12:06,613
[SPEAKER_10]: No, but I think we can get there in like one more meeting for at least Medford square.

1905
03:12:06,633 --> 03:12:12,698
[SPEAKER_10]: And apologies if I'm missing something or kind of confusing things in the late hour.

1906
03:12:13,567 --> 03:12:23,335
[SPEAKER_10]: But what I heard from Alicia is that we have the potential of using the July 9th meeting to continue our deliberations.

1907
03:12:23,375 --> 03:12:29,380
[SPEAKER_10]: We're not doing a huge amount of new work on Medford Square.

1908
03:12:29,400 --> 03:12:30,540
[SPEAKER_10]: We can sever them.

1909
03:12:30,560 --> 03:12:41,909
[SPEAKER_10]: That, I think, is also consistent with some of our other goals and discussions of being able to really go into the details and do one thing at a time.

1910
03:12:43,975 --> 03:12:50,140
[SPEAKER_14]: Am I ninth was the continuation of the public comment for residential.

1911
03:12:50,661 --> 03:12:55,105
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually sorry if I know I'm interrupting both of you know, go for it.

1912
03:12:55,325 --> 03:12:59,128
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have a recommendation for a technical reason.

1913
03:12:59,769 --> 03:13:06,475
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you continue this hearing to July 9, so that it is on the agenda.

1914
03:13:06,975 --> 03:13:24,527
[SPEAKER_06]: And then when you have Commissioner McGivern here and you're sort of putting forth what your questions are, you're not limited to just residential, like you can, you could in fact discuss the squares without actually ever having any intention of closing and finishing on July 9th.

1915
03:13:24,927 --> 03:13:29,811
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you'll need, it won't be time for the consultants to be responding on all of these issues.

1916
03:13:29,851 --> 03:13:34,034
[SPEAKER_14]: So kind of like we did for ADUs and residential, we can hear public comment on.

1917
03:13:34,514 --> 03:13:42,278
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm only suggesting that so that you're not restricted because if something's not on the agenda, you shouldn't discuss it.

1918
03:13:42,298 --> 03:13:42,878
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

1919
03:13:42,898 --> 03:13:46,040
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's a technical continuation to July 9th.

1920
03:13:46,200 --> 03:13:46,480
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1921
03:13:46,560 --> 03:13:47,140
[SPEAKER_06]: I like that.

1922
03:13:47,500 --> 03:13:47,821
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1923
03:13:48,121 --> 03:13:49,141
[SPEAKER_06]: And then maybe we can.

1924
03:13:49,181 --> 03:13:49,842
[SPEAKER_10]: That makes sense.

1925
03:13:50,742 --> 03:13:51,002
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1926
03:13:51,182 --> 03:13:51,502
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1927
03:13:52,843 --> 03:13:55,064
[SPEAKER_10]: And I would very much like to see the commissioner.

1928
03:13:55,124 --> 03:13:56,645
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's a great suggestion.

1929
03:13:56,665 --> 03:14:00,347
[SPEAKER_10]: Kind of in relation to multiple topics.

1930
03:14:02,005 --> 03:14:06,866
[SPEAKER_06]: So, and if I might, I'll just say that he told me that he's excited to come talk to you all.

1931
03:14:08,847 --> 03:14:09,987
[SPEAKER_14]: We love special guests.

1932
03:14:12,848 --> 03:14:13,468
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, cool.

1933
03:14:14,188 --> 03:14:22,010
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think what I'm hearing is we need a motion to continue

1934
03:14:23,598 --> 03:14:27,420
[SPEAKER_14]: the public hearing for Medford Square and West Medford Square to July 9th.

1935
03:14:27,820 --> 03:14:37,125
[SPEAKER_14]: But before we do that, I wanna make sure that we've kind of like shaken the trees for all the different topics that came out of this meeting.

1936
03:14:41,207 --> 03:14:47,870
[SPEAKER_14]: Board members, is there anything floating around in your domes at 1015 on a Wednesday that we wanna add to this?

1937
03:14:49,751 --> 03:14:49,951
[SPEAKER_14]: Ben?

1938
03:14:50,551 --> 03:14:51,632
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd like to just confirm

1939
03:14:52,355 --> 03:15:03,521
[SPEAKER_17]: the feedback mechanism for parcel-specific feedback on the squares, who we should send that to and... We as board members or the public?

1940
03:15:04,202 --> 03:15:05,443
[SPEAKER_17]: We as board members.

1941
03:15:05,503 --> 03:15:07,544
[SPEAKER_17]: I guess it'd be good for both.

1942
03:15:07,664 --> 03:15:14,468
[SPEAKER_17]: I assume for the public that they can just submit the standard public, you know, through the standard public comment channel.

1943
03:15:16,489 --> 03:15:18,330
[SPEAKER_17]: Is that the best channel for board members as well?

1944
03:15:19,994 --> 03:15:26,842
[SPEAKER_14]: For the board members, I would say it's either that official channel or emailing it directly to Alicia and Danielle.

1945
03:15:26,862 --> 03:15:33,891
[SPEAKER_14]: You want to make sure not to include other board members in your messages to avoid any violation of open meeting laws.

1946
03:15:34,772 --> 03:15:35,713
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for confirming.

1947
03:15:36,734 --> 03:15:36,854
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1948
03:15:45,229 --> 03:15:49,331
[SPEAKER_14]: Anything else we want to add to this topic before we make a motion to continue?

1949
03:15:49,571 --> 03:16:01,017
[SPEAKER_14]: It sounds like July 9, as a continuation of the public hearing, would work for Innocent Associates as well, because we're not expecting any new material from you all at that date.

1950
03:16:03,458 --> 03:16:10,282
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, as I said, we'll have a colleague listening in, taking notes, but we will not be presenting anything to you.

1951
03:16:11,480 --> 03:16:21,323
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, and the timeline moving forward for that sounds like it still has some variables in it, but we'll make sure to kind of confirm your capacity and ability along the way.

1952
03:16:22,863 --> 03:16:23,203
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

1953
03:16:23,243 --> 03:16:27,704
[SPEAKER_27]: We do want to make sure that everybody gets the information in a timely manner, so we appreciate that.

1954
03:16:28,705 --> 03:16:28,905
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1955
03:16:29,845 --> 03:16:32,245
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, heard loud and clear from board members and the public.

1956
03:16:34,246 --> 03:16:37,987
[SPEAKER_14]: So we'll improve on that moving forward as a team.

1957
03:16:40,673 --> 03:16:51,881
[SPEAKER_14]: So with that, what I'm looking for is a motion to continue the public hearing for Medford Square and West Medford to July 9th.

1958
03:16:54,102 --> 03:16:54,823
[SPEAKER_28]: So moved.

1959
03:16:55,343 --> 03:16:56,024
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, John.

1960
03:16:56,424 --> 03:16:57,184
[SPEAKER_14]: Can I get a second?

1961
03:17:01,868 --> 03:17:02,328
[SPEAKER_14]: Second.

1962
03:17:04,249 --> 03:17:04,810
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Ari.

1963
03:17:04,830 --> 03:17:06,731
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to do a roll call vote.

1964
03:17:07,211 --> 03:17:08,072
[SPEAKER_14]: Call him as I see him.

1965
03:17:08,832 --> 03:17:09,433
[SPEAKER_14]: John Anderson.

1966
03:17:10,614 --> 03:17:10,754
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

1967
03:17:11,275 --> 03:17:11,755
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1968
03:17:12,036 --> 03:17:12,696
[SPEAKER_14]: Ben LaValle.

1969
03:17:14,698 --> 03:17:14,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

1970
03:17:15,939 --> 03:17:16,560
[SPEAKER_14]: Adam Behrens.

1971
03:17:17,721 --> 03:17:17,841
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

1972
03:17:19,382 --> 03:17:20,283
[SPEAKER_14]: Ari Goffman-Fishman.

1973
03:17:21,224 --> 03:17:21,364
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

1974
03:17:22,485 --> 03:17:23,286
[SPEAKER_14]: Sabrina Alpino.

1975
03:17:23,306 --> 03:17:23,366
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

1976
03:17:24,593 --> 03:17:24,653
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

1977
03:17:25,674 --> 03:17:27,455
[SPEAKER_14]: Myself, Emily Hedeman is also an aye.

1978
03:17:28,276 --> 03:17:33,420
[SPEAKER_14]: So Medford Square, West Medford Square has been continued to July 9th.

1979
03:17:34,220 --> 03:17:36,862
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you so much, everybody that was here that provided comments.

1980
03:17:37,503 --> 03:17:44,728
[SPEAKER_14]: While I still have 41 people in the Zoom, I'm also going to make a plug for applying for city boards and commissions.

1981
03:17:46,810 --> 03:17:50,833
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, we need as much meaningful participation in these meetings, but you know, if you,

1982
03:17:52,720 --> 03:18:00,283
[SPEAKER_14]: If you so desire, you can also apply to be on a board or commission and have potentially even more impact.

1983
03:18:01,164 --> 03:18:06,786
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm going to drop that link in the chat and wish everybody who was here for that topic a good evening.

1984
03:18:07,426 --> 03:18:09,727
[SPEAKER_14]: We do have a couple more items in front of the board though.

1985
03:18:14,329 --> 03:18:16,650
[SPEAKER_14]: So the next item we have in front of the board is minutes.

1986
03:18:18,511 --> 03:18:19,651
[SPEAKER_14]: These are minutes from June 4th, 2025.

1987
03:18:22,818 --> 03:18:23,738
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there any discussion?

1988
03:18:31,121 --> 03:18:32,422
[SPEAKER_10]: I move to accept the minutes.

1989
03:18:34,583 --> 03:18:35,303
[SPEAKER_10]: Can I get a second?

1990
03:18:36,783 --> 03:18:37,284
[SPEAKER_05]: I second.

1991
03:18:38,604 --> 03:18:39,164
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks, Sabrina.

1992
03:18:39,545 --> 03:18:40,565
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to do roll call vote.

1993
03:18:42,026 --> 03:18:42,626
[SPEAKER_14]: Ben LaValle?

1994
03:18:44,386 --> 03:18:44,486
[SPEAKER_17]: Aye.

1995
03:18:45,627 --> 03:18:46,227
[SPEAKER_14]: Adam Behrens?

1996
03:18:47,728 --> 03:18:47,848
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

1997
03:18:48,988 --> 03:18:49,849
[SPEAKER_14]: Ari Goffman-Fishman?

1998
03:18:50,709 --> 03:18:50,809
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

1999
03:18:51,863 --> 03:18:52,644
[SPEAKER_14]: Sabrina Alpino.

2000
03:18:53,564 --> 03:18:53,704
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

2001
03:18:55,506 --> 03:18:56,106
[SPEAKER_14]: John Anderson.

2002
03:18:56,126 --> 03:18:57,588
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

2003
03:18:58,348 --> 03:19:00,550
[SPEAKER_14]: And I, myself, Emily Hedeman, am also an aye.

2004
03:19:00,570 --> 03:19:16,803
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, the next agenda item we have is zoning updates.

2005
03:19:20,062 --> 03:19:20,522
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry.

2006
03:19:20,802 --> 03:19:33,485
[SPEAKER_14]: It's 1015 and we've been talking about zoning all night, but I do want to provide an opportunity if staff has any updates or if we want to review the timeline for the upcoming topics.

2007
03:19:33,885 --> 03:19:40,646
[SPEAKER_14]: I know July 9th is the continued public hearing for residential as well as Medford Square, West Medford Square.

2008
03:19:40,666 --> 03:19:45,887
[SPEAKER_14]: There was a comment deadline

2009
03:19:48,493 --> 03:19:50,594
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, July 23rd is the comment deadline.

2010
03:19:50,614 --> 03:20:02,697
[SPEAKER_14]: Our August 6th meeting will be board deliberations, which we then pass on to Innocent Associates for revisions.

2011
03:20:06,158 --> 03:20:16,262
[SPEAKER_06]: The board has a date of August 20th, because this board meets the first and third Wednesdays, but there is no topic identified for that night.

2012
03:20:21,723 --> 03:20:22,023
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

2013
03:20:22,564 --> 03:20:28,969
[SPEAKER_14]: And all these the dates that we've been discussing throughout these meetings are those available on the zoning website?

2014
03:20:29,529 --> 03:20:29,989
[SPEAKER_14]: Not yet.

2015
03:20:30,049 --> 03:20:30,410
[SPEAKER_06]: Not yet.

2016
03:20:30,450 --> 03:20:33,912
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, we've had some delays in getting updated between vacations of people.

2017
03:20:33,932 --> 03:20:34,553
[SPEAKER_14]: No, you're good.

2018
03:20:34,773 --> 03:20:35,213
[SPEAKER_14]: You're good.

2019
03:20:35,514 --> 03:20:39,377
[SPEAKER_14]: And I know that there's some some conflicts between our meetings and the
