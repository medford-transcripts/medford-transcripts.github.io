    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1.89s">Good</a>  evening, everyone, and welcome to tonight's meeting of the Community Development Board. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=8.317s">My</a>  name is Emily Hedeman. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=9.418s">I'm</a>  the board chair, and I'm going to call the meeting to order. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=12.962s">Let's</a>  begin with some obligatory procedural matters.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=16.966s">Recording</a>  in progress.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=20.892s">This</a>  hearing of the Medford Community Development Board is being conducted in a hybrid format, both in the Medford City Council Chambers, on the second floor of Medford City Hall, 85 George P. Hassett Drive, Medford, Massachusetts, and via Zoom remote video conferencing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=36.544s">Anyone</a>  who would like to listen to or view this meeting while in progress may do so by attending in person or accessing the link that was included on the meeting agenda posted on the city of Medford website. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=48.019s">A</a>  recording of this meeting will be posted on Medford Community Media website as soon as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=53.843s">A</a>  reminder that given the hybrid nature of this meeting, tonight all votes from the board will be made by roll call. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=61.468s">And</a>  then before I keep going, can I just get a thumbs up from the Zoom crowd to confirm that audio is good for you guys? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=68.893s">Great,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=70.434s">And</a>  everyone in the chambers doing okay with audio? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=74.796s">Great,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=78.708s">Please</a>  know that project materials for all projects before the board can be viewed on the city's website medfordma.org by clicking on current CD board filings. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=89.722s">For</a>  those on Zoom, you will also find the link in the chat. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=94.127s">Alicia</a>  or Danielle, would you mind dropping that link in the chat when you have a second? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=112.469s">All</a>  right, we're going to start with roll call attendance of the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=117.012s">Vice</a>  Chair Peter Kalbs. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=133.182s">Ari</a>  Goffman-Fishman. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=134.923s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=136.544s">Hey,</a>  Ari. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=138.645s">Sabrina</a>  Alpino. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=140.246s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=141.587s">Hi,</a>  Sabrina. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=143.225s">John</a>  Anderson?</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=157.717s">Hi,</a>  Ben. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=158.778s">And</a>  myself, Chair Emily Hedeman is also present. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=162.721s">Danielle,</a>  can you please introduce any staff at the meeting or on the call?</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=173.715s">Yes,</a>  thank you, Madam Chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=175.236s">We</a>  have myself, Daniel Evans, senior planner, along with Director Hunt. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=183.061s">Sorry</a>  about that feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=186.203s">As</a>  well as Christian Cepeda. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=188.024s">Oh,</a>  I have to read his name. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=194.948s">Lepofsky,</a>  sorry, I couldn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=197.389s">And</a>  who else? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=198.67s">We</a>  have Jack. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=202.813s">Again,</a>  I need <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=204.829s">Podolsky,</a>  who is the other graduate student intern on the call tonight.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=215.848s">Thanks,</a>  Danielle. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=218.34s">And</a>  before we begin, I just want to run down the agenda for tonight's meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=222.846s">We're</a>  going to be continuing our public hearing on Medford and West Medford squares. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=227.752s">The</a>  board will hear a short presentation from Emily and Paula of Innocent Associates and then move into the board discussion and then public comment period. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=236.863s">Like</a>  last week's meeting, depending on the amount of public participation, the board will take a short recess around 8.30, probably about 10 minutes, and then we're going to reassess at 10 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=248.867s">whether</a>  to vote this topic out of the board or to continue to a date certain. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=255.629s">That</a>  can also be influenced by the comments we hear tonight by the public, so it's not just the timing and logistics of the topic that we're discussing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=263.472s">I</a>  just want to make that clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=270.063s">And</a>  part of the reason why we want to do these reassessments before it gets too late in the evening is because we do value your public feedback, those of you in person and those who have joined by Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=282.89s">We</a>  want to make sure that we have enough time to digest the feedback and to adequately present it to our consultants so they can implement it in the next round of presentations. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=296.813s">Last</a>  week, we did a physical sign-up sheet. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=300.336s">I</a>  don't think we'll need that this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=303.319s">If</a>  we do get more people in attendance, we'll reassess. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=306.742s">But</a>  I think for now, we could just keep it a little bit more informal than last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=313.058s">And</a>  for Zoom, we're gonna use the typical raise hand feature. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=316.099s">We</a>  are going to be prioritizing in-person comments, just recognizing that it is more challenging to attend in person than remotely via Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=325.343s">So</a>  we'll likely process in-person comments and then move on to Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=330.126s">And</a>  we appreciate everyone's patience with that approach. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=336.75s">So</a>  with that, I'm gonna move into our agenda item, which is the public hearing for Medford Square and West Medford Square districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=346.495s">This</a>  is the second meeting for the continued public hearing that was open on June 4th regarding the proposed zoning amendment for the creation of Medford Square and West Medford Square districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=358.56s">Do</a>  we have anyone who is subject to <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=363.538s">who</a>  needed to sign their Mullen affidavits to confirm their eligibility for voting? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=368.499s">I</a>  don't believe we did. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=369.859s">We</a>  do? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=370.579s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=372.62s">Madam</a>  Chair, Benjamin Lavallee signed the Mullen affidavit for missing the first session of the public hearing on June 4th. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=382.002s">So</a>  I received that today.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=384.982s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=385.242s">Thanks</a>  for confirming, Danielle. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=386.483s">And</a>  thank you for taking care of that, Ben. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=388.183s">I</a>  appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=393.814s">Danielle</a>  or Alicia, do you have any introductory comments before we hand it off to Emily and Paola of Innes Associates?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=405.178s">I</a>  just felt like it would be good to make it just very clear that tonight is a public hearing, as Emily said, on West Medford and Medford Square, and that we had continued the public hearing on the residential and neighborhood residential to July 9th. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=420.442s">So</a>  if anybody wants to make comments on that, they have to attend that meeting, or they can submit written comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=427.684s">But</a>  because that public hearing is not open, <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=430.645s">that</a>  there will not be an opportunity to speak on that this evening and I just wanted to make sure that was clear in case somebody thought they were here only for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=439.134s">That</a>  that is not going to happen this evening and we're not able to hear comments on that because of the legal process of having a public hearing.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=449.857s">Yeah,</a>  thanks for that reminder and recognizing that Medford Square and West Medford Square do not exist in vacuums. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=458.299s">Those</a>  residential districts will undoubtedly come up, but I would say if you do have comments regarding the residential districts is to, as Alicia said, attend on the 9th, submit a comment virtually. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=472.202s">There's</a>  a QR code in the back or through the ocdmedford-ma.gov email address. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=480.745s">And</a>  during the break, if anybody has questions, happy to answer them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=484.709s">And</a>  Alicia, Danielle, Christian, and Jack are manning the Zoom chat. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=492.496s">So</a>  with that, I'm going to pass it off to Emily and Paola.</p>

    <p>[Emily Innes]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=498.589s">Thank</a>  you very much, Madam Chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=500.05s">While</a>  Paula shares her screen, I will introduce for the record myself, Emily Ennis of Innes Associates, and I'm here with Paula Ramos Martinez. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=510.537s">We</a>  are going to walk you through just the sort of the reminder and introduction for those who have been part of this process and for those who are new, and then turn over to changes that have been made based on public comment from your first meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=528.89s">So</a>  with that, if you'll move to the agenda, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=533.491s">Next</a>  slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=534.792s">Once</a>  you get to full screen mode. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=537.412s">And</a>  we will both try, I know with it being in person as well as hybrid, that there can be a little bit of an echo in the city council chambers. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=546.755s">So</a>  we are trying to speak slowly and clearly through these wires of computers. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=553.597s">So</a>  if at any point you can't hear us, just let us know. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=558.42s">So</a>  with that, I'm going to talk a little bit about the timeline, just in relationship to the squares, the no next meetings, and give a little bit of introduction, and then I will turn it over to Paula for the squares. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=574.782s">Initially,</a>  just to touch briefly on the residential districts, initially they were ahead of the squares. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=583.746s">And</a>  so the squares included some of the residential districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=587.868s">You</a>  will see from the maps that we have removed those from the squares because we wanted, we didn't want the squares to get ahead of the discussion on the residential districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=600.723s">So</a>  tonight we will be showing and talking about only the mixed-use districts, and that might make some of the what do I speak to tonight versus what do I speak to on July 9th a little bit of an easier discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=614.178s">So</a>  with that, if you'll go to the next slide, please, Paola. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=617.302s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=617.802s">This</a>  has been the process for the discussion of the squares. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=622.438s">We</a>  introduced the commercial framework to the planning and permitting committee on March 12th, discuss Medford square on the 26th and West Medford square on the 9th. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=633.244s">And</a>  then both of them together on April 30th. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=635.766s">And</a>  these of course are all public meetings brought it forward because the city council referred it to this board, the community development board. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=645.475s">So</a>  we discussed it at our first meeting with you on May 8th. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=649.439s">We</a>  had a public listening session on the 4th of June, and then here we are today to talk about it for the second meeting with the community development board. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=659.067s">Next</a>  slide, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=661.573s">Um,</a>  these are the known, uh, dates, uh, based on discussions, uh, from the, with the community development board last week and some discussions with, uh, um, city staff and trying to firm up calendars. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=675.857s">I</a>  believe I saw on the agenda that city staff is going to talk about this further, so they may have some additional updates, but just to give people an idea of what meetings we see, uh, coming forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=687.861s">Uh,</a>  next slide, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=691.041s">So</a>  we've often been asked why why we're doing a rezoning or why the city is doing a rezoning effort and why we're working with them to provide the information that's needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=702.372s">This</a>  comes out of the Medford Massachusetts comprehensive plan, which was approved in January 2023 and has certain goal city over the next.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=711.962s">Emily,</a>  your audio is getting really low.</p>

    <p>[Emily Innes]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=714.525s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=715.006s">I</a>  appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=717.509s">So</a>  the Medford Massachusetts Comprehensive Plan, which was adopted in January 2023 has certain goals for <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=727.841s">housing,</a>  economic development, preservation of open space, and other components. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=734.343s">Some</a>  out of those goals come some zoning recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=738.284s">In</a>  addition, the city adopted a climate action and adaptation plan that also had recommendations for zoning changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=746.386s">It's</a>  these two documents that have kick-started the process of looking more in-depth at the zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=753.368s">The</a>  city has been working on zoning changes since the recodification began in 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=759.451s">Some</a>  of our language around corridors, squares, and neighborhoods is coming from this future land use map that you see in front of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=768.256s">So</a>  just for those people who may not have been part of the earlier part of this process, that's what kicked all of this off were these two documents. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=776.86s">And</a>  then we have been working with the city, as I said, to provide information, options, materials for discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=785.149s">And</a>  with that, for the next slide, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=790.338s">Part</a>  of what we've been hearing is questions and concerns about what does this mean for my property or my neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=798.743s">So</a>  we did put all of the information onto an interactive online map and people can go there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=806.187s">If</a>  you go to the next slide, Pally, we can provide the link to you to that map. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=812.391s">There's</a>  a lot of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=813.932s">It</a>  is a little clunky, but you can change the layers, you can change filters, and you can also click on individual parcels and see what's happening on the different lots. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=826.541s">There</a>  is a video on the City's website for this zoning effort that explains how to use it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=833.605s">So</a>  if you haven't used it and you're interested in learning more, I recommend that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=838.309s">We</a>  have also been trying to build additional tools, and you will see some of them today to understand what's happening where. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=846.054s">And</a>  so with that, with that introduction and a guide to maybe some of the tools that we have available for you, and we are continuing to build more in response to public comment, to kind of parse this information, I'm going to turn it over to Paola <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=860.865s">talk</a>  specifically about the squares and potential changes for the board's consideration.</p>

    <p>[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=870.511s">Thank</a>  you, Emily. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=871.851s">If</a>  I may, Madam Chair, I'm going to continue with the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=876.254s">Let</a>  me know if you hear me okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=878.215s">It's</a>  pretty low. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=880.436s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=880.837s">I</a>  can maybe rise my voice. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=882.778s">Maybe</a>  it's that.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=883.478s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=884.779s">It's</a>  going to feel like you're yelling, but just yell.</p>

    <p>[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=887.1s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=887.5s">Perfect.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=889.582s">So</a>  I'm just going to start with the zoning and the proposals. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=896.267s">I'm</a>  going to go fast because we've already seen this and I want to focus more on the recommendations, but if anyone has any questions feel very free to ask and we can go back, we can go to the draft and <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=913.041s">we</a>  can answer and take the time that you need. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=916.563s">So</a>  this is about the existing zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=918.904s">We</a>  are looking into two squares, Medford Square and West Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=925.086s">We</a>  are going to start with Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=926.987s">So</a>  we see it here, the location in Medford and we are going to have a zoom in <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=937.853s">This</a>  is the existing, the current condition. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=941.937s">What</a>  you see in this dash black line is the first or the boundaries of the Medford square. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=954.331s">As</a>  you can see in here, the existing districts you have are these pink ones, is the commercial one. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=963.359s">Here</a>  we have in the slides all the things that can be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=966.141s">It</a>  can go up to six stories with residential. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=969.244s">Then</a>  you have apartment two, it can go up to six stories for residential and then for hotel 15. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=976.39s">And</a>  then we have some general residential, and that is more for single and two units and then single family on the north part of Terrell and Governors Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=993.925s">Here</a>  are all the existing and current dimension standards for these two districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1002.807s">This</a>  was the second proposal and the one that was referred from the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1009.528s">The</a>  proposal that we are bringing here today is going to be the same, nothing changes except for those boundaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1018.089s">What</a>  we are going to do is just to <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1021.17s">take</a>  out all the residential areas and only talk about the existing, the mixed districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1031.913s">And</a>  so what you're going to see in both are going to be the same districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1036.437s">We're</a>  going to talk about mixed use 1B. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1039.219s">This</a>  district will only appear here in the Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1042.802s">We</a>  have it in the narrow areas and narrow parcels next to the river where we have some historic buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1055.493s">And</a>  so we propose the mixed use 1B. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1058.556s">It</a>  goes up to four stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1060.297s">Then</a>  we have the next one in intensity will be the mixed use 2A. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1065.459s">This</a>  goes up to five stories by right and plus two with incentive zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1069.88s">Then</a>  we have the purple one that's mixed or used to be more intense. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1075.862s">That</a>  is seven-story by right and two with incentive zoning, and then mixed-use three, that is only this area next to the 93, and that is mixed-use 3A, actually, and that's eight stories by right plus four with incentive zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1096.0s">So</a>  this is mainly, there are no changes from the one that we've seen in the previous. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1101.664s">It's</a>  just the boundaries that have changed to only focus on non-residential. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1108.623s">exclusive</a>  residential districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1111.005s">Then</a>  when we go to West Medford, we also have the same or similar, at least we have that concentration of that commercial one along the high street and then the place where the commuter rail is to stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1132.68s">There</a>  we have that commercial one that goes up to six stories by right, <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1136.402s">Then</a>  we have the general residential, single-family, and apartment one. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1143.805s">There</a>  is no limit of residential units. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1148.327s">There's</a>  no cap. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1150.428s">It's</a>  with the height. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1151.749s">It's</a>  permitted three stories by right in those areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1155.471s">This</a>  is the existing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1156.311s">Again,</a>  we have all the table and dimensional standards if anyone has any question. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1161.514s">about</a>  the existing, we can talk about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1164.677s">Then</a>  we have the first proposal or the one that we've shown here in the previous. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1170.964s">Again,</a>  we've done the same, basically take out all the exclusive residential districts and bring only that core of the <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1183.112s">of</a>  the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1184.774s">So</a>  in this one, we don't have so many different as we had in Medforska, we have four gradients of intense mixed use. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1193.461s">Here</a>  we have two that mix use 2A and mix use 2B, which are up to five stories by right with two with incentive zoning, and then mix use 2B, that purple that goes up to seven stories by right plus two with incentive zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1210.832s">So</a>  what we have prepared, and we can go through them if anyone is interested, is these different boards where we can have the summary of the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1226.164s">districts</a>  and so we have one board with both of the maps with the districts and then we have the information by building types and then we see the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1239.031s">So</a>  what can I do in each of the districts? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1242.993s">And</a>  so we see that, for example, mixed use 1B we have from three unit dwelling that is permitted. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1249.578s">It's</a>  not permitted in the other districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1252.059s">Historic</a>  conversion is permitted only in MX1B and 2A. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1257.763s">Minimum</a>  three units for 1B, minimum four units for 2A. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1262.686s">etc.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1263.147s">And</a>  so what building types are allowed in each of the districts in a very simple way that we can see that bigger picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1272.814s">And</a>  then in case it's difficult to understand what we are talking about, there is a definition of each of those building types. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1280.78s">Also,</a>  whenever applies incentive zoning, we have also clarified that in this table. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1289.526s">And</a>  then <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1290.933s">We</a>  do another table, and that is with the dimensional standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1294.675s">So</a>  that is also easy to see all of the dimensional standards in one table. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1299.058s">And</a>  with all of the districts together, we have all the different standards, and then the diagram to understand better, and then words in an image. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1312.265s">You</a>  see what we are talking about, what is the frontage, what is active ground floor, and all of these different standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1321.411s">And</a>  so that is easy to compare.</p>

    <p>[Emily Innes]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1324.073s">And</a>  Paola, if I could just jump very quickly in, just so everybody online or in the room knows, we have provided these as PDFs for the city to post on their website. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1335.721s">They've</a>  been great about posting the materials, but they are also set up as full-size posters. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1341.686s">So</a>  either we can print them out and give them to the city or they can print them out. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1348.388s">to</a>  be available for people to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1350.069s">So</a>  although it looks small on the slide, they are actually 24 by 36 poster size.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1359.136s">You</a>  and I think alike, Emily, because I just dropped a link to the presentation in the meeting chat. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1364.64s">So</a>  if anybody wants to zoom in a little bit extra on those tables, which I know I am going to do, that link is in the chat.</p>

    <p>[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1374.472s">And</a>  later I can go through the if anyone asked I can go through the tables, so we can see it with a little bit of more high quality image. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1386.378s">I</a>  will continue now with the recommended changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1391.321s">As</a>  I said, we can go through the draft. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1393.942s">If</a>  anyone asks for, we have the draft, we can go through all the changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1398.785s">Here</a>  are only the ones that we are recommended from the version that was referred from the city council to the suggestions that we have for the <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1411.392s">For</a>  the city board to consider. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1414.535s">So,</a>  the 1st thing is to update the draft. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1417.017s">It</a>  was updated to exclude all the references to the residential districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1422.101s">Since</a>  we are not going to vote on that on those residential areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1429.526s">Then</a>  the second will be to update the section 94.3.2 and these are the table of use regulations and so we have several modifications and so we have all the different uses that are from the table of uses. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1445.372s">I</a>  will go through them because they are not a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1447.653s">So</a>  A4 is the three-unit dwelling detached. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1451.957s">This</a>  will be also added by right to the MX1B, and it's the only one that has changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1458.803s">The</a>  other districts do not allow a three-unit dwelling. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1463.288s">The</a>  MX1B is the lowest from all the four that we have seen, so we think that adding that smaller scale would be <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1473.997s">would</a>  be good for this to show a little bit of that diversity in skills. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1479.041s">Then</a>  we have 8.5, that is the multiplex, that building that holds from four to six buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1485.185s">Again,</a>  this is also by right and it's going to be by right for MX1B and as well for MX2A. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1493.05s">In</a>  2B and in 3A won't be allowed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1499.384s">Then</a>  we also have the townhouse. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1501.546s">In</a>  this case, again, depending on the units that we allow, on the minimum units that we allow in the different districts, we would allow a townhouse with those minimums. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1513.893s">In</a>  the MX1B, a minimum townhouse of three units would be allowed, which is the minimum for a townhouse, and the MX2A would be allowed a four-unit townhouse. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1527.882s">Then</a>  we have added the I.6 and this is municipal parking area or garage as a principal use and this is not allowed in MX1B and MX2A but will be allowed by right in more intense districts MX2B and MX3A. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1549.958s">This</a>  is a new use that we are adding to the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1553.821s">Then</a>  we have new numbering because we added this municipal parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1558.644s">We</a>  need to renumber the open storage, moving of land, radio and television tower and solar energy system. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1565.428s">That's</a>  the only thing that changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1567.23s">There</a>  is no added or change in the by right or allowed or not allowed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1573.433s">Then</a>  we added a footnote referencing K1 accessory dwelling units, which states that subject to change for the revision of the new ADU ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1584.776s">Again,</a>  as we haven't gone through residential ADU, we don't feel comfortable in placing something that hasn't been updated and approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1595.999s">We</a>  want to wait until that is approved and then this will change <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1600.283s">and</a>  add those protected ADU uses, local ADUs and by special permit ADU. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1609.103s">Then</a>  we have some recommendations for the table of dimensional requirements and is all the highlighted in yellow that you will see here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1619.008s">For</a>  the lot area square footage, we have MX2B and MX3A. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1623.31s">This</a>  was answering to a comment that we got in the last city board meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1633.696s">which</a>  state that 5,000 was too big for people that wanted to do something. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1639.003s">So</a>  we checked the areas, how many were from 3,000 to 4,000, and we had a few from 4,000 to 5,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1643.568s">So</a>  we lowered into 4,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1652.438s">So,</a>  more will be conforming and we would be able to have something with all the requirements in a 4000, we cannot have very tall buildings, but we could have some 2 layers of commercial, you know, so we would have that info possibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1671.333s">instead</a>  of having a vacant land. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1674.276s">Then</a>  we have the frontage, we reduce as well the mixed 3A to 40% and then the active ground floor it's now reduced to 60%. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1689.612s">Since</a>  a lot of the lots are smaller with small frontage, so we have the entrance to a garage or parking, then we need that active ground floor gets reduced. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1703.67s">And</a>  then we have <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1705.192s">Setbacks,</a>  this was also from a comment for historic buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1709.555s">We</a>  had a front minimum of setback of three, from three to 20, so we have changed that so that the historic buildings, so that doesn't fit as it was like zipper, I think she described it, so that it's more aligned. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1728.369s">We</a>  don't mind to have that zero setback. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1732.151s">Then</a>  the rear setback, we changed it to zero. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1734.292s">We</a>  also had some comments on that end, but we do have a protection that whenever any of these districts abuts a residential district, we have a 10-foot rear and side setback so that it protects the residential neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1757.808s">Then</a>  we have the updated, we continue with the dimensions in this case is the stormwater and landscape. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1763.893s">We</a>  have a building coverage of, we updated to 90% on the more intense ones. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1770.538s">So</a>  that's MX2B and MX3A. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1774.201s">And</a>  we have the <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1776.13s">open</a>  space permeable. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1777.271s">So</a>  we had now two. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1779.193s">One</a>  comes from Salem corridor and Mystic Avenue corridor where we use permeable open space. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1788.7s">Now</a>  we're using pervious. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1790.101s">That</a>  is a more general definition. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1793.584s">So</a>  we want to continue with the pervious and that's why we are cleaning a little bit that remnant from the other corridors. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1801.17s">That</a>  will be fixed also at the end of the process when we do a cleanup. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1805.433s">And</a>  those are reduced to 10% in MX2B and MX3A. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1812.158s">We</a>  have green score. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1813.118s">So</a>  whenever the project has a bigger impact, has to go through green score. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1819.042s">So</a>  that is to be clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1821.684s">And</a>  then we have open space landscape that also changes to 15% and 10%. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1825.526s">So</a>  these are changes from the previous. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1832.021s">Then</a>  we have updated definitions. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1834.582s">We</a>  want to add building coverage. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1836.563s">The</a>  current Medford, what it has is lot coverage, but the lot coverage actually does not take into account any accessory buildings, accessory structures, <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1852.769s">So</a>  it's only the principal building. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1855.27s">So</a>  we want to update that the maximum area of a lot that is permitted to be covered by the combination of the principal buildings, accessory buildings, and accessory structures. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1866.814s">And</a>  then the building coverage of the structure is measured from the outside of the exterior walls and the ground story, including covered porches and other building components. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1876.077s">So</a>  this is the one that we would like to recommend as the new definition and new dimensional standard. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1887.605s">And</a>  then we have the section applicability. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1891.167s">Again,</a>  we need to exclude the residential districts from the definition and description of both areas, of both squares. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1904.217s">Then</a>  we change the district name of Mixed Use 1 to Mixed Use 1B. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1909.921s">There</a>  is a difference between, for example, the Mixed Use 1 that we had in Salem, <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1914.985s">and</a>  the mixed-use that we are proposing now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1918.848s">They</a>  are quite different, so that's why we want to bring the new name. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1922.391s">Then</a>  we would have mixed-use 3 to go to mixed-use 3a, since in Mystic we have another 3, which is even more intense, and so that will be 3b in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1938.08s">Then</a>  we go to dimensional requirements and waivers section 94-9.x.3. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1946.564s">Here</a>  we have some recommendations and what you see that is changing is what I have highlighted in yellow. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1954.708s">Sometimes</a>  it's just a way of making it more clear in the way it's written. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1963.131s">We</a>  just change for the front setbacks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1966.793s">the</a>  language of a maximum setback of 20 feet that is allowed for the purpose of creating an active public plaza. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1974.436s">That</a>  language is changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1977.398s">Then</a>  there were some districts that were bringing something from a different. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1984.961s">There</a>  was a commercial district here, so it's changed to MX3. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1988.903s">We</a>  don't have commercial districts here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=1991.464s">Um,</a>  then we don't know exactly because we don't have the residential districts yet instead of going the explaining which residential districts and then change it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2001.788s">And</a>  again, we just generically call that anything that abuts that residential district. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2008.111s">The</a>  height setback is required. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2009.913s">It</a>  was very specific to Salem and Mystic, so in here we had to change it to the four-floor and above, since now we have higher buildings than six stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2028.969s">For</a>  the ground floor active frontage, we changed the definition of active uses. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2034.672s">And</a>  so we use this as follows. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2037.013s">Active</a>  uses include retail, restaurant, cafes, personal services, other active commercial uses, publicly accessible office or residential lobbies, and active building amenities spaces, example, gym, residential, common space. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2053.38s">Where</a>  active commercial uses are not feasible, the following may be substitute, a residential stoop, a setback of green, open space, or a public space with seating, public art, such a mural or sculpture, or another use that provides an engaging ground floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2074.005s">Then</a>  we wanted to also bring here the daylight minimum standards that we are working on. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2081.687s">It's</a>  not yet fully drawn, but we wanted to introduce and just tell the community that will be defined. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2092.27s">It's</a>  just a little bit more complex, needs time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2095.81s">We</a>  wanted to make it well. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2098.671s">We</a>  just wanted to introduce it and say that we are working on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2104.332s">So</a>  this is the end. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2105.873s">These</a>  are all the recommended changes that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2109.294s">If</a>  there is any question, if you want me to go through any of the development standards or look into the different sections that we have prepared before, just let me know. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2120.077s">I'm</a>  going to stop here.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2129.001s">Great,</a>  thank you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2130.421s">I</a>  really enjoyed the visual, the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2133.362s">I</a>  think I mentioned it as you were doing it, the table that kind of compares all the different districts and then all their features. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2140.764s">I</a>  think that's something maybe we as a board want to go back to and really dig into. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2147.585s">So</a>  the next thing that we have is board discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2150.686s">And</a>  I have a couple of questions for Paola and Emily. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2155.107s">Let's</a>  see. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2161.269s">I</a>  guess I just have one to start off with, and then I want to kind of send it off to the rest of the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2166.01s">So</a>  for the ground floor active frontage, I noticed that you mentioned publicly accessible lobbies. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2174.513s">I've</a>  read some stuff lately about a proliferation of banks being <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2182.482s">occupying</a>  first floor spaces and some of our most dynamic squares. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2186.043s">I</a>  know we obviously cannot prevent specific uses, but is there a way that, you know, we can look for active uses that are active for longer than just a workday that kind of give us like a vibrant nightlife and provide services for residents outside of, you know, Monday through Friday, nine to five.</p>

    <p>[Emily Innes]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2213.288s">I'll</a>  jump on that and then Paula, feel free to fill in as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2218.451s">The</a>  act of ground floor is a really tricky definition to parse in some ways, because I think all of us who have been working in this field have heard of places that have required ground floor commercial that hasn't been filled. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2234.92s">And</a>  so the way we try and think about it now is, <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2238.582s">What</a>  is, to your point, Madam Chair, what's going to draw people at different times of the day and increase that foot traffic? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2247.706s">So</a>  a lot of places, this has been slightly amended, but this has actually come from another Massachusetts city that we've been working with, where they've expanded the definition of active use. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2259.631s">It's</a>  interesting you're bringing up the bank because of course we've always thought of banks as being static places, but a lot of banks are starting, I know of one for example, and I think it's in Brookline, and I've seen them in other places, where the bank has a cafe, they have a co-working space as part of their ground floor lobby because they're trying <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2281.771s">to</a>  attract a different level of customers. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2284.094s">So</a>  I think it's important with this idea of we're requiring a certain percentage of ground floor active frontage, but we need to be flexible about what counts as ground floor active. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2300.042s">So</a>  I agree with you, the ideal is something that encourages activity for more than just nine to five, but how we get there and how we define that so that it's flexible, not just for now, but 10, 15, 20 years from now is a little bit of a challenge. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2317.309s">So</a>  I'd love to hear more from you board members and from the public of other ways we could also think about this.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2323.732s">I'm</a>  curious what precedents are out there <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2329.831s">around.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2332.942s">you</a>  know, more consistent activation at different times of the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2336.043s">You</a>  know, what popped into my head was, you know, can we, can we require that, you know, a business is open X number of hours or, you know, X number of evenings, you know, per week, but, you know, we don't want to mandate how businesses do their business. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2352.386s">So</a>  that feels like we're getting into kind of tricky territory. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2355.327s">I</a>  see Ari's hand, curious if they have any other ideas or any other questions.</p>

    <p>[Ari Fishman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2363.907s">Yeah,</a>  so I'll start with commentary on what we were just talking about and then the question I had. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2370.997s">I</a>  agree that the banks are a very good example, especially for Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2379.16s">I</a>  have yet to see someone express excitement about Chase moving into the old vault space. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2385.762s">I</a>  know there's nothing we can do about it, but I think it is a problem for our public squares. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2391.424s">I</a>  am very cautious about mandating the specific hours because when I think about a space like that, <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2399.165s">we</a>  would love a daycare there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2401.666s">I</a>  know it's a loss to the square that the one next to Abisuya is moving, although they did find a new church. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2408.928s">They</a>  by definition just have very limited hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2412.409s">I</a>  don't think that's going to be the tool we want to use, but big fan of thinking creatively about this and taking in public comment to think about how we can do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2426.153s">The</a>  question I had was just maybe like <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2429.99s">5</a>  extra sentences about the daylight thing kind of obviously it's not created, but like, what is the broad shape that you're trying to get wording for? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2439.087s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2443.132s">Madam,</a>  if I may, yeah, I can jump into that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2446.874s">1</a>  thing that we were working also for the. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2451.496s">Question</a>  that was the precedent question, if I just can. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2455.657s">Best</a>  answer a little bit more. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2458.539s">We</a>  have some in the incentive zoning, some. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2462.46s">Incentives</a>  for local. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2466.922s">commerce,</a>  local business so that they can get, if they rent it or sell it to a local business, they can have some incentives there to move that more local economy. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2484.832s">Then</a>  there's also design guidelines. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2487.373s">Sometimes</a>  it's not about that we're not working on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2492.416s">That's</a>  for the future, but just to keep in mind, <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2496.819s">sometimes</a>  it's not as much of what business is but that is transparent enough and that there is a connection between the outside and the inside and there is an exchange of people walking in by a lot of times the banks have or banks or real estate office where they have <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2517.377s">all</a>  the windows completely covered and you cannot see really into the office, that doesn't create a very active. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2524.064s">So</a>  having certain standards for design guidelines that open that transparency makes it, even though it's not a super active intense business, but that at least there is some kind of transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2535.214s">So</a>  that would be another way of at least activate a little bit more. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2540.528s">about</a>  the daylight now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2543.111s">So</a>  we are looking into different options. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2547.014s">One</a>  that I find very interesting is more about, so the sun study, it's never static, it's very dynamic. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2560.465s">So</a>  you need a very broad study, not only for a day, but for the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2567.831s">And</a>  so to have, <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2569.872s">At</a>  least we're looking into finding the months that are the worst case scenario months. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2579.159s">Then</a>  from that, having a certain amount of hours a day in those months that are protected from your neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2589.806s">The</a>  impact that these new developments need to study is how much they are going to impact the residential neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2599.053s">And</a>  so we will, there are many different ways to do this, but that is the one that I think worked best and it's more realistic and also gives a lot of flexibility for the architecture, how that design could help instead of being a static block, if they start to play with the form. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2620.638s">they</a>  can get those minimum hours a day protected without compromising too much the development of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2630.543s">So</a>  that is, I think, the one that we're exploring the most, but it needs to be, it's not well-established in the US, so we want to get it right and also look in nationally other strategies that might be interesting.</p>

    <p>[Emily Innes]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2649.159s">And</a>  just to piggyback on that, I think what we're all talking about is how do we set standards for certain things, certain results, certain conditions that we want to have happen, but then it's up to the applicant with an actual project to come forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2664.549s">So</a>  for example, on the daylight, the zoning was set the standard, the applicant would come before the CD board for either a site plan review or a special permit, and they would have to do a study at that point. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2677.04s">to</a>  prove that they met the requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2680.262s">And</a>  so getting the standards right is critical and understanding how somebody would be able to prove that they met those conditions as part of setting the standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2694.513s">I</a>  think there was a trend a few years back for noise ordinances and other ordinances where the ability to measure, it's like, okay, we can have the standard, but how do you measure it? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2705.756s">The</a>  ability to measure wasn't something that was practical or cost-effective. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2710.997s">And</a>  so we want to make sure that we get it right so that somebody comes in front of the board, you all know what's being measured and why and how.</p>

    <p>[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2720.229s">And</a>  also, these are studies that are easy to do for an architecture office that basically every program right now does it in this way. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2730.557s">So</a>  there is no extra cost that they have to call to an engineering firm to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2735.74s">It's</a>  just very easy to do with the programs that we have right now.</p>

    <p>[Ari Fishman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2741.104s">Thanks,</a>  both of you.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2749.453s">I</a>  see Alicia's hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2752.234s">Oh,</a>  I'll defer to Ben. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2754.856s">When</a>  the board has finished commenting, I actually have a couple of questions and thoughts that I just wanted to make sure the board heard and considered too.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2764.161s">All</a>  right, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2768.003s">Board</a>  member Ben.</p>

    <p>[Ben Lavallee]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2770.504s">Hi,</a>  thank you, Emily. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2773.546s">I</a>  have a couple of different categories of feedback, I guess. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2779.032s">The</a>  first is that the changes to terminology and definitions are quite hard to follow, even for me on the CDB. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2790.803s">And</a>  so I imagine, and this is a bit of feedback that we've had from the public repeatedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2795.987s">So</a>  for example, MX1 in April is now MX1B in June. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2804.21s">I</a>  would argue that when we're distributing materials to the public or presenting in a public forum like this, that we should actually just write the words out because it's very hard to keep track of all the different acronyms. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2814.2s">So</a>  I don't want to nitpick, but there were several slides with tables with MX1B and 2A and somebody, you know, in the community trying to keep up with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2826.572s">It's</a>  just overwhelming, frankly. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2829.718s">And</a>  I know everybody's, everybody's working hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2831.719s">So</a>  that's a commentary just on sort of simplification, not, you know, not anybody needing to do a better job or anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2840.543s">So</a>  I just want to be clear about that.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2842.724s">So</a>  I think the term... Can you give us the ambiguity now before you go further on those?</p>

    <p>[Ben Lavallee]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2847.887s">I</a>  don't, I don't need it now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2849.448s">I</a>  think I, I think I'm, I think I'm caught up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2852.735s">But</a>  I think it leads into another point, which is around the timing of distribution of materials, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2858.521s">And</a>  so in the preparation for tonight's meeting, you know, watched prior videos, reviewed prior presentations, looked at all the materials that were available in our file shares. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2872.875s">And</a>  even now, in the public file shares, <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2878.015s">the</a>  presentations that are being reviewed tonight weren't uploaded until less than an hour before the meeting, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2884.757s">And</a>  I would put forward that with everything that everybody has on their plate, people's clear passion for this topic and the future of this city, that we should give the public time to digest. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2897.262s">And</a>  if that means that we need more time, then so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2900.143s">These</a>  are important decisions, but uploading the presentation less than an hour before the public hearing, <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2907.11s">just</a>  people's heads are spinning and it's hard to have any meaningful feedback when you're just like trying to make sure that you understand what's been put in front of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2915.914s">So</a>  I think that we should consider, for example, public distribution of presentations several days in advance with some sort of notification from the city that materials are available for review and so that the public comment and the dialogue can be <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2932.035s">grounded</a>  on people having had a chance to digest it versus trying to digest it in a meeting like this and provide feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2939.419s">I</a>  think that's just a lot to ask of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2943.361s">And</a>  then I do wanna clarify, because again, this changed for tonight's meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2948.344s">Tonight,</a>  we're talking about the squares with the updated boundaries, not the residential areas, because there are certain corners of Governors Ave, <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2960.971s">Ashland</a>  Street, which is where I live, Oakland Street, where those lines have moved since the last meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2968.435s">So</a>  can somebody please clarify exactly what's being discussed tonight? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2972.097s">I</a>  believe it's after we've kind of moved the lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2976.099s">Is</a>  that true?</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2977.482s">Yeah,</a>  Emily. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2978.503s">Yeah,</a>  just just to be super clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2980.584s">This</a>  is not something that has been confirmed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=2983.747s">This</a>  is a recommendation that we as a board can discuss to see, you know, do we think it makes more sense to restrict that boundary for West Medford Medford Square and only talk about these commercially focused zones? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3000.198s">so</a>  that we're not conflating them with the residential. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3005.161s">But</a>  I'll pass it to Emily just to double confirm.</p>

    <p>[Emily Innes]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3009.784s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3010.644s">So</a>  a couple of things, and thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you, Ben. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3014.987s">I'm</a>  going to work my way backwards. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3018.389s">So</a>  for tonight, initially, the squares came, were recommended to the CD board after the residential districts were recommended to the CD board. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3030.111s">So</a>  the thought was that the small areas of the squares that were the same as the other residential districts, those residential districts would have gone through the process and so we could keep them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3044.634s">But</a>  now the squares are perhaps, we don't know because it depends on the discussion today, but there's a possibility that they could happen, they could be voted back to the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3057.005s">prior</a>  to the residential because the residential path as of last week has now slowed down. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3063.127s">And</a>  so we didn't want the city board, we didn't want, we don't want the city board and we didn't want the city council to be ahead of the rest of the residential district conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3075.392s">So</a>  our recommendation and Chair Hedeman is absolutely spot on when she says all of these are recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3082.054s">Our</a>  recommendation is let's pull <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3084.175s">the</a>  neighborhood residential districts out of the discussions of the square so we don't inadvertently get ourselves cross-tied on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3093.239s">Same</a>  thing with the ADUs. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3094.34s">The</a>  ADUs are now part of the residential discussion that's been slowed down. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3099.122s">We</a>  can't pass the ADUs as shown because we would then be ahead of ourselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3105.585s">So</a>  that's part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3107.383s">That</a>  also, in many ways, feeds into the discussion of when materials are getting to you, because we've been trying to respond to public comment on several different topics, and we've been having about a public meeting with you a week, whether it's been a <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3126.462s">a</a>  public listening session or community development board meeting or a planning and permitting committee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3135.046s">In</a>  a couple of cases, we've had two meetings a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3137.968s">We</a>  are working pretty much as fast as we can to meet the meeting schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3145.493s">And,</a>  you know, that is what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3147.634s">That's</a>  what we do as consultants. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3149.155s">So</a>  we're not happy that we're not getting it to you further in advance. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3154.118s">We</a>  would like to be a little bit further in advance. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3156.119s">And</a>  maybe the summer is- Emily, your audio is going out a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3159.041s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3159.361s">And</a>  maybe the summer is an opportunity for us to catch up to that so we can get it in advance. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3165.404s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3166.225s">So</a>  there's an apology from me to all of you that they haven't been as fast, but we have been working as fast as we can.</p>

    <p>[Ben Lavallee]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3173.658s">Thank</a>  you so much for the clarifications, Emily. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3176.461s">And</a>  just to be clear, like totally recognize everybody's working as hard as they can, uploading materials as quickly as they can. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3185.589s">It's</a>  more so, you know, the reasonableness of the timing for everybody to do a comprehensive job. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3191.534s">And</a>  put me, now that you've clarified, I appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3196.038s">I</a>  do think it's good to separate <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3199.928s">neighborhood</a>  residential from the squares. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3202.63s">I</a>  like the redrawn lines that remove some of the residential properties from the Medford Square conversation, for example. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3211.154s">I</a>  would recommend that <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3213.523s">you</a>  know, some of the materials that were just presented and that are in the public folders now, I think it presents an opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3220.708s">By</a>  doing this, it gives us an opportunity for simplification of the materials. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3224.471s">So,</a>  for example, a lot of the maps, while they are focused on the squares, <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3231.015s">they</a>  continue to show the residential neighborhoods, and they're all color coded, and you just run into a situation where there's too many colors, and they're too closely aligned, and it makes the maps kind of harder to read. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3241.925s">So</a>  I would posit that for the squares, we should just <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3245.502s">gray</a>  out the whole neighborhood residential areas and use nice, bright, easily distinguishable colors for the different areas in the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3252.207s">So</a>  totally recognize the pace that we're moving and the changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3256.831s">And</a>  I do appreciate Innes Associates' responsiveness to public comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3262.375s">I'll</a>  be quiet here in just a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3263.536s">I</a>  have one more thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3265.438s">And</a>  this also I think is in line with what we've heard from the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3269.321s">There</a>  happens to be, <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3271.367s">in</a>  one of the areas that's designated as mixed-use with like a five-story limit, I forget which mixed-use category it is, is a National Grid substation, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3283.258s">It's</a>  on Salem Street, kind of right by the bus stop there across from City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3289.484s">And</a>  I'm curious, you know, I think we should, I feel uneducated and I think <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3296.7s">by</a>  extension, we can assume that most of the public would benefit from some education around what does this mean for the city's infrastructure, specifically power, sewer, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3307.325s">Does</a>  this mean that National Grid can sell that building and there's going to be a five-story apartment building put there? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3312.948s">If</a>  so, what are the implications for the city's electric distribution? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3317.771s">So</a>  I don't know sort of who owns that piece of it, but I do think that there should be a public dialogue around <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3326.623s">the</a>  infrastructure and its ability to support this increased density, increased commercial usage, that little substation on Salem Street is kind of a good case study for the type of thing that I imagine people are eager to hear about. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3343.314s">I</a>  took a lot of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3344.235s">Thank</a>  you for listening to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3346.336s">Appreciate</a>  it.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3349.559s">It's</a>  all good time, Ben. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3352.461s">And</a>  I, <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3354.987s">I'm</a>  going to hand it off to Alicia. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3356.827s">Yeah,</a>  we were just talking about this earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3359.188s">So</a>  it's a perfect question.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3362.669s">So</a>  actually, I'm going to answer that in two ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3366.81s">And</a>  one is that they're two completely separate questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3370.09s">So</a>  can you hear let me move the mic closer to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3373.251s">Can</a>  you Okay, is that better? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3375.051s">Can</a>  you guys hear me on the zoom? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3376.592s">And</a>  does that make a difference? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3377.532s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3378.272s">question.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3378.452s">Um</a>  so let me answer that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3379.773s">And</a>  there are two completely separate questions here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3382.754s">One</a>  is what does it mean for the existing parcels? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3385.456s">So</a>  that parse that substation, for example, has been zoned commercial for the last 60 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3393.499s">So</a>  why would they sell now? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3396.221s">Because</a>  we re zoned it something else. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3398.322s">So</a>  they've had six stories by right as a residential <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3407.246s">So</a>  there's no real reason to think that rezoning it to, and I'm just going to be very specific, five stories by right with two of incentive zoning is any reason to think that they would sell that property and suddenly move that substation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3423.479s">And</a>  they certainly could not legally do something that would hurt the city's electrical infrastructure, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3430.304s">The</a>  utilities have a legal obligation to pre-providing <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3435.489s">adequate</a>  electricity natural gas to the city, and they can't say wow we could make a lot of money by selling this and now the city doesn't get as much electricity, like they just they can't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3448.949s">So</a>  that's sort of one piece of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3451.052s">Um,</a>  so this this zoning wouldn't impact that at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3455.094s">The</a>  other question, though, is how does all of this impact the city's infrastructure? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3460.076s">And</a>  again, there's one thing that I've said in the past that I'll repeat, and then I have sort of a new new offer new information. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3467.459s">So</a>  one is that if somebody is building a really big building, then there is analysis done. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3475.506s">We've</a>  got a building permit going through right now for 250 units over on Fells Way. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3481.912s">It's</a>  one of the 40B properties you're all familiar with. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3485.823s">And</a>  when they went through their permitting process and they went through their site plan review at that time, engineering looked at their water capacity, their sewer capacity, they looked at all those types of things, the roads at that time, what's the safety, do they need crosswalks? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3503.211s">And</a>  all of that is put on at the time a big project is actually proposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3508.894s">And</a>  so that's when you're getting, that's when the rubber hits the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3512.495s">That</a>  said, people have been asking about sort of the big picture, like incremental change, you know, how does DPW look at this stuff? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3520.899s">How</a>  does fire and police look at this stuff? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3523.56s">And</a>  so one of the things that so Danielle and I have sat down with the fire chief, and we're discussing potentially asking him to provide a letter, sort of documenting what he and I discussed about how the roads and increased density would infect <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3539.887s">affect</a>  the fire department and I've also spoken with our DPW commissioner and he would be more than happy to respond to specific questions from the board in writing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3550.929s">He</a>  would also be happy to come to a meeting and sort of take questions and some questions he could answer on the fly but really he would then follow that up with <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3563.192s">responses</a>  in writing, but sometimes it's easier to frame the question when you have the person in front of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3569.42s">And</a>  so he and I have talked about him attending one of your upcoming meetings to be able to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3577.329s">I</a>  think that's sufficient. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3579.031s">Does</a>  that sort of get at it?</p>

    <p>[Ben Lavallee]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3580.012s">Yeah,</a>  it does. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3581.014s">And</a>  if I could just <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3582.603s">take</a>  another 30 seconds here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3583.764s">Thank</a>  you for kicking off those conversations. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3586.306s">I</a>  think it's been a repeated bit of feedback from the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3589.168s">So</a>  that's really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3591.409s">And</a>  I appreciate that you've started that process already and that the fire chief and DPW are willing to be participants. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3599.475s">And</a>  on the utilities thing, frankly, I think that this is a great opportunity just to educate the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3606.08s">I</a>  think there's a little bit of, <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3608.61s">fear,</a>  uncertainty, and doubt out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3610.891s">And</a>  the fact that there are, you know, legal protections that the city has around service levels from our utility providers, this is a great opportunity through this rezoning process for us to evangelize that with the public and make sure that people, you know, that if they do have fears, that those fears are put to bed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3631.298s">And</a>  if there's something that is legitimate, that we address it, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3635.739s">Because</a>  it is something that people have brought up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3638.806s">over</a>  and over. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3639.567s">So</a>  thank you, Alicia.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3641.708s">Yeah,</a>  Ben, I think those are some great opportunities to maybe add to the FAQs of the zoning website that we already have up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3651.254s">Maybe</a>  it's also an opportunity to include as part of a future presentation, specifically thinking about the next residential zoning meeting that we're having. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3663.683s">But</a>  yeah, I think you're asking some good questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3669.425s">And</a>  Ari, I see your hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3671.37s">I</a>  did want to kind of just <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3678.405s">If</a>  the board isn't already thinking about it, I just kind of want to throw this out, because this is a discussion I'd like to have in terms of our comfort and confirmation of the renewal of these residential districts from the boundaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3693.797s">So</a>  if you, board, Adam, Sabrina, Ben, Ari, if you haven't been thinking about it, just start thinking about it, because I'd like to kick off a discussion with us after board member Ari's comment.</p>

    <p>[Ari Fishman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3709.493s">Thanks,</a>  Madam Chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3711.134s">I'm</a>  happy to say that I think that's a smart move. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3715.177s">Let's</a>  not confuse ourselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3718.359s">And</a>  Medford Square is my neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3721.601s">I</a>  think it makes sense to separate them out. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3724.222s">And</a>  I do want to second member Ben's suggestions about kind of very intentional simplification for the purpose of clarity for public materials. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3737.195s">The</a>  public has shown a huge appetite for wanting to be involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3740.117s">Let's</a>  make it possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3743.619s">The</a>  comment I wanted to make with Medford square kind of. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3749.222s">Pet</a>  gripe the. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3752.403s">Pedestrian</a>  crossing at Salem street coming out of Ashland is a death trap. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3757.296s">I</a>  have complained about it many times. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3758.957s">I</a>  know my neighbors have. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3760.178s">I've</a>  almost been hit multiple times. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3761.68s">People</a>  are flying off of the exit from 93. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3766.303s">And</a>  I will use my opportunity on this board to say that we're rezoning this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3773.689s">We're</a>  trying to make it an active pedestrian-friendly area. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3777.412s">That</a>  crosswalk is a problem.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3784.371s">Well,</a>  I wish that wasn't your experience, but this is a great time to note those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3790.475s">I</a>  see board member John's hand.</p>

    <p>[John Anderson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3796.379s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3797.7s">Can</a>  you hear me okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3801.042s">I</a>  guess so.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3803.784s">Zoomers,</a>  can you hear him?</p>

    <p>[John Anderson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3806.085s">Yes,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3806.726s">First,</a>  I wanna thank Ben for bringing up the issue of materials and when they're posted. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3813.899s">Because</a>  I made the mistake of yesterday, printed out what I thought was the latest version of the memo. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3820.785s">So</a>  I was sort of confused for the first 20 minutes or so of the presentation because things didn't line up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3827.411s">So</a>  I'm glad I understand that now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3830.134s">Just</a>  for me personally, I need to be able to page through stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3834.818s">Just</a>  presenting all the tables linearly, it's kind of hard to piece all that together. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3839.865s">and</a>  understand the real impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3841.426s">So</a>  thank you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3843.787s">Also,</a>  adding to Ben's comments on the infrastructure, I think impact on the schools should also be considered. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3853.312s">You</a>  talk about adding 200 units on the Fellsway. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3858.375s">I</a>  don't know how many kids are gonna be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3863.96s">What</a>  schools will be going to? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3865.44s">I've</a>  heard, I don't know this for a fact, but I've heard that some of the schools are getting overcrowded. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3871.122s">So</a>  I think that should be added to the mix too. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3874.522s">And</a>  then I have some more specific questions on historic conversions, which I see are part of what's allowed in MX 1, 2, and 3. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3888.006s">It's</a>  been stated that historic conversions are allowed if there are no changes to the <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3894.341s">outside</a>  of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3896.143s">But</a>  then at another meeting, I heard someone say, Oh, well, unless that's required to provide access. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3902.448s">And</a>  I just like to get some clarity on does no changes to the exterior mean no changes or just necessary changes might be okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3914.418s">And</a>  my other question on <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3916.468s">historic</a>  conversions is, I wonder where the 70 years came from, a building of more than 70 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3924.934s">Because</a>  a lot of Medford is, a lot of Medford was built before 1955. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3933.239s">And</a>  I think most of the buildings that we're talking about were built before 1955. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3940.42s">And</a>  then my last question is, I think it would be of help to me and perhaps the community, if somebody could pull together the vision of what you're going for for these squares. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3953.485s">Is</a>  the idea to be a sort of mini version of assembly row? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3957.406s">I'm</a>  not saying there's anything wrong with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3961.268s">Or</a>  what exactly are we hoping for that we're going to see there? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3967.93s">Sort</a>  of what it's like now, but with <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3970.63s">sort</a>  of apartment buildings on top of the retail? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3975.693s">Are</a>  there going to be garage entrances for cars to enter the apartment buildings from the street? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3984.398s">I'm</a>  just at a loss to sort of visualize how this is going to turn out.</p>

    <p>[Ben Lavallee]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=3996.225s">Would</a>  it be OK for me to react to John's feedback quickly?</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4001.687s">Yeah,</a>  go ahead.</p>

    <p>[Ben Lavallee]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4003.748s">I</a>  think for Medford Square specifically, and I'm less familiar with the West Medford Square history, but with Medford Square specifically, there's kind of like three <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4017.357s">Three</a>  like anchor documents, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4019.58s">And</a>  I do to John's point, I think it might be nice if we could somehow tie these together for public consumption. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4025.748s">There's</a>  the city's comprehensive plan, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4028.172s">Which</a>  has been around for several years and has a whole section dedicated to Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4033.77s">There's</a>  the recent development proposal from Transom and the responses to the RFP for the city owned parcels, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4041.895s">The</a>  three big city owned lots with the parking and the mixed use development and the grocery store and all of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4048.299s">And</a>  then there's this rezoning conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4051.081s">So</a>  there's kind of like three separate categories of information that ultimately will come together in the future of Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4060.266s">And</a>  I do think that <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4063.257s">it</a>  might be worth figuring out how to kind of tie those all together so that the public doesn't feel like they're, and the board frankly, it doesn't feel like they're having to kind of hop between three different stories about one part of the city.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4084.841s">I</a>  just dropped a link to the comprehensive plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4088.142s">And</a>  in terms of the 70 years, I mean, <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4091.708s">John,</a>  I'm not sure of your exact background, but I remember it had some connection to the Historical Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4096.971s">Is</a>  that correct?</p>

    <p>[Emily Innes]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4098.432s">I</a>  can answer that, Madam Chair.</p>

    <p>[John Anderson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4100.453s">I</a>  don't believe so. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4102.394s">The</a>  Historical Commission... The Historical Society? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4104.835s">No,</a>  no. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4105.896s">Commission</a>  reviews demolition of buildings that are over 100 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4112.879s">And</a>  the Society, by the way, has nothing to do with any of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4116.001s">We're</a>  a 501c3.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4121.833s">Okay,</a>  you were part of the Historical Society.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4123.895s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4124.595s">So</a>  I would say if you have a more appropriate recommendation than 70 years, you might be a good person to put something forth.</p>

    <p>[John Anderson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4136.045s">I</a>  guess my question more broadly is, why is there a particular age of the building to qualify for historic conversion? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4145.232s">I</a>  mean, if it's a good idea for a building that was built in 1955, why not one that was built in 1990?</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4152.509s">Yeah,</a>  that's a great question.</p>

    <p>[Emily Innes]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4160.113s">Madam</a>  Chair, I can address the year if it's okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4163.595s">The</a>  70 year is a typo, it's 75 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4166.317s">I</a>  think we corrected a few meetings back from when it first came in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4170.44s">And</a>  it is from the Medford Historical Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4174.463s">The</a>  commission, I'm just reading from their website and then I'll put it in the link. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4178.305s">But</a>  the commission is charged with reviewing all requests for demolition of buildings constructed more than 75 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4185.39s">So</a>  that's where we got the 75 years and we would be <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4189.978s">happy</a>  to hear reasons for changing that to another number. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4193.739s">But</a>  I just wanted to let you know the origin of the 75 years.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4198.88s">But</a>  if we change that 75 years, would we have to update it with the historical commission so that they're aligned?</p>

    <p>[Emily Innes]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4204.542s">No,</a>  that's just for the demolition bylaw. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4206.762s">It</a>  does not have to be the number. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4209.923s">And</a>  so that was the number. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4211.903s">But</a>  they don't have to be aligned.</p>

    <p>[John Anderson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4214.564s">Can</a>  I just point out that we're talking about two completely different things here? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4218.922s">The</a>  historical commission has some influence when someone wants to tear down a building or tear down part of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4230.146s">Exterior</a>  changes, that's all they're concerned about. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4234.127s">You</a>  can do whatever you want inside the building, no matter young or old, but what we're talking about here is really this idea of converting a building to a more appropriate use if there's room inside it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4248.257s">And</a>  I don't understand why, how old the building is, has anything to do with that if you're not making any changes to the exterior?</p>

    <p>[Emily Innes]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4257.105s">Excellent</a>  question. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4258.065s">And</a>  Madam Chair, I can answer the purpose of the historical conversion. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4262.969s">So</a>  the reason that we were doing the historical conversion is because we had heard fairly early on that people were worried about <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4270.084s">the</a>  loss of historic buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4271.945s">And</a>  so the way it was, and historic homes in Medford, because Medford has many of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4277.046s">So</a>  the way it was originally structured is that it would give an incentive to retain a historic home because you would be able to create more units out of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4288.49s">So</a>  you're absolutely right, there would be interior changes that would allow those units. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4293.232s">And</a>  then the idea is that no exterior changes would be allowed except for those <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4299.37s">by</a>  building code to provide access to the new unit. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4302.653s">So</a>  that is the exterior change that would be allowed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4305.715s">It's</a>  building code recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4307.817s">But</a>  the idea was to give an incentive so that those buildings would be retained rather than being torn down. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4316.023s">So</a>  in this case, we were asked to align <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4319.66s">the</a>  age with the age that the Historical Commission uses for demolition of buildings for their review. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4327.165s">Again,</a>  happy to hear another number, but just giving you the background of where those numbers and where the intent came from.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4340.833s">John,</a>  do you have any reactions to that?</p>

    <p>[John Anderson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4343.315s">Well,</a>  I mean, I don't think this is the point. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4345.356s">This</a>  is the time to sort of debate that particular point, is it? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4350.654s">But</a>  I thank you for clarifying that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4353.856s">I</a>  would like to hear the idea of the vision for what's happening here, a broadly stated vision from our planners.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4364.462s">Let</a>  me find the page in the comprehensive plan and then send that to your way. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4369.565s">But</a>  Alicia and Danielle, if you can provide a summary while I look for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4376.822s">Did</a>  you want Madam chair?</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4377.963s">I</a>  just wanted to talk about address the historic conversions a bit more. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4384.667s">Would</a>  you want me want to come back to that? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4386.949s">Or</a>  because I wanted to address that I as staff would be recommending changes to strengthen those design standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4397.215s">I</a>  think that additional <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4400.658s">Egress</a>  doors should be on side elevations and on the front facade so that it still reads. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4408.271s">You</a>  know, is that original structure was built and the idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4415.548s">of</a>  some of these areas that may be not being up zoned as much because of the large amount of these older, like larger historic homes, that that would incentivize adding the units within the existing structure so that the built character does not change as much. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4439.593s">because</a>  we're hearing a lot of, you know, this is the look and feel, you know, the historic fabric of this old historic community, some of the existing mature trees, mature landscapes, and this could be a way to add gentle density in some of these historic areas so that density doesn't have to be at odds with historic preservation.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4473.951s">Great,</a>  that's helpful information to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4476.112s">So</a>  in terms of what we're talking about today, just to kind of recenter us, I'm going to go back to the PDF. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4499.552s">All</a>  right, so just to clarify, is historic conversion present in the mixed-use districts that we're talking about today?</p>

    <p>[John Anderson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4515.006s">My</a>  version of the document has it a yes for MX1, 2, and 3.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4520.117s">So,</a>  Madam Chair, one of the things that I wanted to raise is that I'm unclear that there are any properties in those areas that would qualify, because my understanding was that it was a single family home, that might be a moot point anyways. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4536.932s">That's</a>  what I was actually just going on Google Maps to see if there were literally any and in Medford Square.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4545.64s">Yeah,</a>  it's in 1B, 2A. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4548.582s">Oh,</a>  for removing the residential, where's that?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4551.044s">Right,</a>  but it's, right, so it's not in the 1A. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4554.267s">So</a>  it's allowed, what the Innes Associates put in their presentation was to recommend adding <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4562.014s">historic</a>  commission to MX 1B and 2A, which is the pale blue and the dark blue. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4567.635s">And</a>  in West Medford Square, if you don't mind, I kind of want to group the three unit dwelling in with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4575.597s">So</a>  in West Medford Square, there's none of the light blue area at all being recommended at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4582.539s">There</a>  are, however, in some of the purple areas, so there may actually be some some houses along some of the roads in the dark blue areas in West Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4598.053s">That's</a>  what I was trying to figure out. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4600.515s">Are</a>  there any of these areas that could be either commercial? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4605.319s">So</a>  this is the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4606.359s">Ground</a>  floor commercial also, or the mixed use also has a strong active component. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4612.564s">This</a>  is where having residential stoops would be allowed because you wouldn't necessarily need to make it be <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4618.389s">a</a>  house it could be and it could be it's actually I think in the corridors where you'll see areas where you'll say well actually you could put houses in between these stores and that would be lovely but in Medford Square you don't want somebody putting a house along High Street or Salem Street in the areas that are highlighted those are already more dense than that right if you if you look at those areas and that was some of my <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4646.19s">My</a>  question here, and are there any houses that would qualify? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4651.155s">Because</a>  if the properties don't exist, then the conversation is not an it's not unuseful because it does need to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4660.163s">But</a>  it's appropriate to happen in the residential zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4664.146s">Kieran.</a> </p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4671.013s">So</a>  how do we get an answer there? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4676.36s">Hi</a>  Emily, I see your hand.</p>

    <p>[Emily Innes]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4678.642s">Thank</a>  you, Madam Chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4680.283s">I'm</a>  actually looking at the interactive map where we have the age of buildings and we can sort it by the districts that we're looking at. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4688.528s">There</a>  are buildings of an age that would qualify for historic conversion. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4692.951s">It</a>  would take us a little better that are within the districts we're looking at, but it would take us a little bit more time, I suspect. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4698.935s">that</a>  most of them are commercial, but there might be a scattered residential or two. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4704.279s">So</a>  we would need to confirm that for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4706.921s">I</a>  do agree, however, that while this is an important conversation, there are probably fewer buildings that would be affected by this, especially now that we've taken the residential out than would be affected by other parts of the zoning.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4726.047s">So</a>  I want to toss it back to John as the person who brought up the historic conversion. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4732.269s">Is</a>  this something you'd like to continue discussing? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4735.01s">We</a>  can come back to it.</p>

    <p>[John Anderson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4736.151s">Yeah,</a>  I would like to.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4738.091s">Related</a>  to the West Medford Square and Medford Square?</p>

    <p>[John Anderson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4741.573s">I'm</a>  hobbled a bit by the fact that I'm looking at the April 30th maps. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4745.754s">So</a>  it's hard for me to figure out which buildings are in which color. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4760.667s">April</a>  30.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4765.253s">Let's</a>  see if we can get you updated ones. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4771.258s">Danielle</a>  or potentially Christian, would it be possible to print the updated, just those like couple of pages so that John has those physical copies? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4783.466s">Cause</a>  it sounds like that's what he's more comfortable with. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4785.287s">Would</a>  we be able to do that in the next couple? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4788.689s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4789.27s">So</a>  maybe we can take a break. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4791.891s">This</a>  might be a good time to take a break and then John will make sure that you have the, <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4796.385s">all</a>  the updated information, physical copies, and then we can come back. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4803.207s">I</a>  wanna look at the rest of the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4804.788s">Are</a>  we okay with like a 10 minute break? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4807.588s">I</a>  see some thumbs.</p>

    <p>[Ari Fishman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4809.449s">Yep,</a>  I do wanna flag that I got a message that a member of the public was having trouble at the front door. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4816.331s">So</a>  if we can just have someone make sure that that's appropriately open.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4821.393s">The</a>  front door of the city hall? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4823.353s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4824.394s">Oh,</a>  shoot, okay, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4826.402s">We'll</a>  go check that for sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4827.442s">Thank</a>  you, Ari. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4829.143s">All</a>  right, 10-minute break. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4831.903s">We</a>  will return at 8.15. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4835.884s">And</a>  before we went on break, one of the things we were talking about is kind of the vision for these squares. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4845.106s">And</a>  I was going to pass it over to Alicia, who's going to share some more information about that.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4852.075s">Alicia.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4853.276s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4853.936s">So</a>  one of the things that I feel like we talked about very early on and a while ago, but wasn't sort of talked about tonight was the looking at what actually exists in the squares and what the current zoning is and what we would really like to be seeing and. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4873.067s">There</a>  is the current zoning actually allows four-story commercial, it allows six-story residential, but it doesn't have a type called mixed use. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4882.23s">So</a>  when buildings want to have ground floor commercial with residential above, they have to jump through extra hoops through zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4889.133s">And</a>  that becomes kind of problematic, more expensive for developers, they're less likely to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4893.795s">So</a>  it's easier for them to build a single-story commercial building, <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4897.576s">or</a>  a multi story residential building. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4900.018s">And</a>  so that's what you see in several places in our squares and not completely there are some mixed use buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4907.064s">But</a>  there's even some of the ones that are mixed use today have gone through the variance process over the last three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4915.25s">So</a>  what we know from economic development is that small businesses thrive on having people nearby, who frequent those businesses, and that if you have people who live in apartments above cafes and bakeries and little stores like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4932.967s">they</a>  are dramatically more likely to go downstairs and buy from those stores regularly and frequently than somebody who lives even just three blocks away or four blocks away. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4944.493s">And</a>  so having a density of people who live above the stores is actually a really good thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4951.617s">So</a>  making that a simpler path <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4954.098s">for</a>  developers so that we would see more apartments above businesses is something we would like to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4960.524s">And</a>  that's what we already have a lot of in Medford Square and West Medford Square, but we'd like to see more as we modernize this as a regular type. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4970.252s">And</a>  it also signals to developers we'd like to see this and not it's a special hoop you have to jump through. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4977.437s">I</a>  think that that kind of hits it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=4979.598s">It's</a>  not like that we're going for assembly row, so much as we're going for small walkable downtown districts that are nice for people to live in and shop in, and also having the additional residents living in your downtown means that you have people coming and going at night, so you automatically have a more vibrant <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=5002.246s">community,</a>  because there are people there in the evenings, even if they're not coming going to the bank, they're going home to their apartment upstairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=5011.813s">The</a>  other thing, is it okay if I sort of mentioned the garage that I mentioned garages that I mentioned on the break, because that's just sort of another piece of this.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=5020.7s">Yeah,</a>  this is a slightly new topic, kind of going specifically into the table of uses just to flag that for board members, right.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=5029.605s">So</a>  in our table in the table of uses, we didn't allow or the currently recommended version is not allowing all the different parking garage types. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=5039.771s">Including</a>  allowing principal parking garages accessory, but nearby a couple blocks away. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=5046.799s">And</a>  so something that I think we would benefit from is the idea that developers could build a private garage. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=5054.649s">two</a>  blocks from their apartment building or their mixed-use building, and then their tenants could walk over there to get their cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=5062.493s">So</a>  they would have some place that they're able and illegally allowed to park, but it doesn't have to be them turning off of High Street to go under the building, you know, next to the businesses on High Street or next to the businesses on Salem Street, that they might have a separate parcel where they park their vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=5081.301s">And</a>  that would allow <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=5083.102s">more</a>  development and residential development in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=5086.806s">So</a>  that was one of the things that we we've been talking about is this idea of allowing parking garages. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=5093.974s">I</a>  know there's a lot of interest in the city building parking garages and that's one of the things that's under discussion, but also private developers may choose that that is the better way to take advantage of their properties. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=5105.986s">So</a>  I just wanted to put that out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=5107.606s">It's</a>  my recommendation that we allow all the parking garage types in all of these zones in order to incentivize less parking on site and more parking nearby.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=5119.35s">Yeah,</a>  I think that makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=5124.751s">Kind</a>  of a critical mass of parking rather than a sprinkling of it throughout the squares. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=5132.152s">Um,</a>  one thing I'd like to add from my own experience is developments like Assembly Square and even what's happening in Union Square in Somerville right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=5141.662s">Those</a>  were part of urban renewal areas where a master developer was selected. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=5147.708s">I</a>  don't believe we have plans to select a master developer. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=5154.225s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=5155.445s">Yeah,</a>  but not for like the entire square, like we're not. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=5159.026s">Yeah,</a>  we're not declaring anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=5160.627s">What</a>  is it blighted decadent decadent or forget what the third thing is, but this is definitely prioritizing.</p>

    <p>[Emily Innes]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=5171.269s">What'd</a>  you say, standard housing, blighted decadent blighted area decadent or substandard housing.</p>
