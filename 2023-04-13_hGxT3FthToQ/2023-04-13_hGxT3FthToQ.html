    <p>[Ricciardelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hGxT3FthToQ&t=334.15s">Hello</a>  families. <a href="https://youtu.be/hGxT3FthToQ&t=335.092s">It's</a>  so great to see you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hGxT3FthToQ&t=336.335s">I</a>  see a couple of familiar faces. <a href="https://youtu.be/hGxT3FthToQ&t=338.797s">for</a>  those of you that have your screen on. <a href="https://youtu.be/hGxT3FthToQ&t=341.758s">So</a>  as Superintendent Edouard-Vincent just said, within an hour, maybe a little over an hour, you will know for sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/hGxT3FthToQ&t=349.739s">So</a>  when we run the stat track program, which is a random number generator, Kim Miles, who you were introduced moments ago, is gonna be running that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hGxT3FthToQ&t=361.661s">So</a>  she's in the room, but you're not gonna see the numbers as they're pulled up. <a href="https://youtu.be/hGxT3FthToQ&t=365.522s">She's</a>  gonna pull them up, <a href="https://youtu.be/hGxT3FthToQ&t=366.913s">they're</a>  gonna be printed out, and then they are going to be put onto our website. <a href="https://youtu.be/hGxT3FthToQ&t=371.317s">All</a>  right, so at that point, you'll see which school you're assigned to, whether it be the McGlynn or the Andrews. <a href="https://youtu.be/hGxT3FthToQ&t=377.182s">We</a>  are gonna pull them in alphabetical order, so the Brooks will be first, followed by the McGlynn, then the Mississippi, and then the Roberts. <a href="https://youtu.be/hGxT3FthToQ&t=385.048s">And</a>  then once you do find out which school you're assigned to, you will be invited to one of the open <a href="https://youtu.be/hGxT3FthToQ&t=393.447s">one</a>  of the two open houses. <a href="https://youtu.be/hGxT3FthToQ&t=394.847s">So</a>  the Andrews open house will be on May 4th and the McGlynn open house will be on May 2nd. <a href="https://youtu.be/hGxT3FthToQ&t=400.629s">You'll</a>  also be getting an official letter with the school assignment that is slated to go out on April 24th. <a href="https://youtu.be/hGxT3FthToQ&t=407.911s">We're</a>  hopeful that we're going to be able to get it out to you before the end of this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/hGxT3FthToQ&t=412.453s">So</a>  we scheduled it for April 24th, but we think we can get it out to you earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/hGxT3FthToQ&t=418.273s">All</a>  right, so I think without any further delay in this process, I know that you wanna find out as soon as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/hGxT3FthToQ&t=425.657s">I</a>  think at this point, we are gonna turn it over to Kim and she is gonna start the random number generator for the Brooks Elementary School. <a href="https://youtu.be/hGxT3FthToQ&t=435.462s">And</a>  it's just gonna take maybe a minute or two, maybe three for each school. <a href="https://youtu.be/hGxT3FthToQ&t=440.424s">So</a>  sit tight.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hGxT3FthToQ&t=442.546s">Also</a>  in true lottery fashion, <a href="https://youtu.be/hGxT3FthToQ&t=446.056s">I've</a>  had the pleasure of always playing our Jeopardy music because we're kind of waiting. <a href="https://youtu.be/hGxT3FthToQ&t=451.921s">So</a>  please enjoy the music from Jeopardy.</p>
