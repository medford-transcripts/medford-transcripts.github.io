00:01:28,372 --> 00:01:30,814
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening, everybody.

2
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:50,112
[SPEAKER_02]: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for being here for a lottery.

3
00:01:50,152 --> 00:01:51,694
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just doing some final preparations.

4
00:01:52,322 --> 00:01:57,208
[SPEAKER_02]: and setting up the Zoom, Dr. Edouard-Vincent will be with you shortly for the lottery.

5
00:01:57,248 --> 00:02:00,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much for joining us today, and we'll be with you shortly.

6
00:03:05,707 --> 00:03:09,408
[SPEAKER_01]: Good afternoon, Mustang family.

7
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:11,368
[SPEAKER_01]: I am so excited to be here.

8
00:03:12,128 --> 00:03:20,410
[SPEAKER_01]: We have right now 77, probably more than 77, because I see some of you are with your parents right now on the call.

9
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:21,470
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really excited.

10
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:24,191
[SPEAKER_01]: We are getting ready to do our middle school lottery.

11
00:03:24,831 --> 00:03:27,932
[SPEAKER_01]: I am Dr. Edouard-Vincent, your very proud superintendent.

12
00:03:28,472 --> 00:03:32,533
[SPEAKER_01]: And with me today, I have our data manager, Ms.

13
00:03:32,593 --> 00:03:33,313
[SPEAKER_01]: Kim Miles.

14
00:03:33,871 --> 00:03:39,495
[SPEAKER_01]: who is going to be working magic in the background on the table right behind me.

15
00:03:39,515 --> 00:03:48,062
[SPEAKER_01]: And next to me is Dr. Bernadette Riccadeli, who is our director of professional learning and student assessment.

16
00:03:48,863 --> 00:03:51,285
[SPEAKER_01]: And Dr. Riccadeli is here as well.

17
00:03:52,125 --> 00:04:02,754
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we go through today's process to actually select the schools and do the actual lottery, if there are questions,

18
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:06,044
[SPEAKER_01]: We will be putting it in the chat box.

19
00:04:06,925 --> 00:04:16,329
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have questions or you need clarification or support, either Dr. Ricciardelli or Ms.

20
00:04:16,369 --> 00:04:20,831
[SPEAKER_01]: Kim Miles, you will be able to email them with questions.

21
00:04:20,891 --> 00:04:24,333
[SPEAKER_01]: So we will make sure that we get that into the chat box.

22
00:04:25,233 --> 00:04:27,374
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to thank you all for your patience.

23
00:04:28,785 --> 00:04:32,486
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a couple of different technology.

24
00:04:32,526 --> 00:04:35,907
[SPEAKER_01]: We're using the Zoom room and we're using our individual computers.

25
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:38,727
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're muted at different points.

26
00:04:39,447 --> 00:04:45,849
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to end the suffering and hopefully have lots of rejoicing that's going to take place.

27
00:04:47,429 --> 00:04:49,170
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to start this lottery process.

28
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:52,831
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do it in ABC order, alphabetical order with our schools.

29
00:04:54,451 --> 00:04:58,592
[SPEAKER_01]: And as soon again, as the schools are picked,

30
00:04:59,961 --> 00:05:04,525
[SPEAKER_01]: we will be working very diligently to get those numbers online.

31
00:05:05,565 --> 00:05:12,070
[SPEAKER_01]: So that you will be so give us about an hour, but we may be able to get it online, you know, maybe within 30 to 40 minutes.

32
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:16,553
[SPEAKER_01]: So that depends on how quickly we are able to get everything done.

33
00:05:16,573 --> 00:05:24,279
[SPEAKER_01]: I am also just gonna pass the baton to Dr. Ricciardelli and give her a minute just to address you as well.

34
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:26,240
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we will start

35
00:05:26,855 --> 00:05:28,579
[SPEAKER_01]: The lottery process.

36
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:32,547
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you again for your patience and good afternoon to all of you.

37
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:35,032
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello families.

38
00:05:35,092 --> 00:05:36,194
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so great to see you.

39
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:37,938
[SPEAKER_04]: I see a couple of familiar faces.

40
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:41,277
[SPEAKER_04]: for those of you that have your screen on.

41
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:49,719
[SPEAKER_04]: So as Superintendent Edouard-Vincent just said, within an hour, maybe a little over an hour, you will know for sure.

42
00:05:49,739 --> 00:06:00,901
[SPEAKER_04]: So when we run the stat track program, which is a random number generator, Kim Miles, who you were introduced moments ago, is gonna be running that.

43
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:05,482
[SPEAKER_04]: So she's in the room, but you're not gonna see the numbers as they're pulled up.

44
00:06:05,522 --> 00:06:06,402
[SPEAKER_04]: She's gonna pull them up,

45
00:06:06,913 --> 00:06:11,297
[SPEAKER_04]: they're gonna be printed out, and then they are going to be put onto our website.

46
00:06:11,317 --> 00:06:16,661
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so at that point, you'll see which school you're assigned to, whether it be the McGlynn or the Andrews.

47
00:06:17,182 --> 00:06:24,288
[SPEAKER_04]: We are gonna pull them in alphabetical order, so the Brooks will be first, followed by the McGlynn, then the Mississippi, and then the Roberts.

48
00:06:25,048 --> 00:06:30,913
[SPEAKER_04]: And then once you do find out which school you're assigned to, you will be invited to one of the open

49
00:06:33,447 --> 00:06:34,467
[SPEAKER_04]: one of the two open houses.

50
00:06:34,847 --> 00:06:40,049
[SPEAKER_04]: So the Andrews open house will be on May 4th and the McGlynn open house will be on May 2nd.

51
00:06:40,629 --> 00:06:47,411
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll also be getting an official letter with the school assignment that is slated to go out on April 24th.

52
00:06:47,911 --> 00:06:52,333
[SPEAKER_04]: We're hopeful that we're going to be able to get it out to you before the end of this week.

53
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:57,334
[SPEAKER_04]: So we scheduled it for April 24th, but we think we can get it out to you earlier.

54
00:06:58,273 --> 00:07:05,277
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so I think without any further delay in this process, I know that you wanna find out as soon as possible.

55
00:07:05,657 --> 00:07:15,442
[SPEAKER_04]: I think at this point, we are gonna turn it over to Kim and she is gonna start the random number generator for the Brooks Elementary School.

56
00:07:15,462 --> 00:07:20,364
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just gonna take maybe a minute or two, maybe three for each school.

57
00:07:20,424 --> 00:07:21,265
[SPEAKER_04]: So sit tight.

58
00:07:22,546 --> 00:07:25,207
[SPEAKER_01]: Also in true lottery fashion,

59
00:07:26,056 --> 00:07:31,821
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had the pleasure of always playing our Jeopardy music because we're kind of waiting.

60
00:07:31,921 --> 00:07:35,443
[SPEAKER_01]: So please enjoy the music from Jeopardy.

61
00:07:38,746 --> 00:07:39,487
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, Miss Miles.

62
00:07:40,067 --> 00:07:42,809
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so Lottery 1 at the Brooks.

63
00:07:57,862 --> 00:07:59,543
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, you know,

64
00:08:26,884 --> 00:08:28,106
[SPEAKER_03]: okay the first draw

65
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:01,059
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize.

66
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,180
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize for the echo.

67
00:09:05,001 --> 00:09:13,484
[SPEAKER_01]: The first draw just took place for the Brooks, and the second draw will be taking place as well.

68
00:09:13,784 --> 00:09:14,144
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

69
00:10:36,204 --> 00:10:41,927
[SPEAKER_03]: I apologize for that.

70
00:10:42,827 --> 00:10:45,908
[SPEAKER_01]: Second lottery just pulled lottery to Brooks.

71
00:10:46,268 --> 00:10:47,489
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's complete.

72
00:10:47,969 --> 00:10:49,510
[SPEAKER_01]: Brooke School is complete.

73
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:53,852
[SPEAKER_01]: So for each school, for each school, there will be two draws.

74
00:10:54,447 --> 00:11:13,306
[SPEAKER_01]: The first draw and the second draw is for some of our students that are that have some of our students with disabilities that there is a draw to evenly balance the students between every single school.

75
00:11:13,746 --> 00:11:16,509
[SPEAKER_01]: So, for every single school, there will be two draws.

76
00:11:17,377 --> 00:11:23,681
[SPEAKER_01]: And right now that we've completed the Brooks, we're going to move on to the Glen, but both draws just took place.

77
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:24,422

[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to swing to jump through.

131
00:18:33,615 --> 00:18:36,257
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to just give you a shout out for being on the call.

[SPEAKER_01]: Can I see any hearts go up?

00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:52,232
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's have everybody who's on the call, whatever school you represent,

154
00:19:53,421 --> 00:20:03,969
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I asked was, clapping for the Brooks, thumbs up for the McGlynn, heart for the Missituk, and the little party horn for the Roberts.

155
00:20:04,009 --> 00:20:06,831
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I see everyone respond all at once?

156
00:20:07,731 --> 00:20:08,472
[SPEAKER_01]: Fabulous.

157
00:20:08,992 --> 00:20:10,894
[SPEAKER_01]: Erlandy, I see you.

158
00:20:10,914 --> 00:20:19,680
[SPEAKER_01]: I see you, Ben, and Ida, and Michelle, and Miss Deimos, and David, and Lynn.

159
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:21,690
[SPEAKER_01]: Wonderful.

160
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:28,294
[SPEAKER_01]: I see all Mary and Victoria and Jenna and Courtney and Wally.

161
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:29,835
[SPEAKER_01]: Wonderful.

162
00:20:29,855 --> 00:20:32,756
[SPEAKER_01]: I see Kirk.

163
00:20:33,016 --> 00:20:35,318
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Kirk Davis.

164
00:20:36,058 --> 00:20:36,898
[SPEAKER_01]: I miss Hayes.

165
00:20:36,918 --> 00:20:37,419
[SPEAKER_01]: I see

166
00:20:42,337 --> 00:20:42,998
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, warrior.

167
00:20:43,098 --> 00:20:43,859
[SPEAKER_01]: Wonderful.

168
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:52,711
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just wanted to give any of the principles a quick opportunity if they if they just want to say hello and Kim I saw you.

169
00:20:53,091 --> 00:20:54,854
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for your wonderful reactions.

170
00:20:56,975 --> 00:21:06,182
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't announce the numbers because the numbers are personal to every single student and family.

171
00:21:06,803 --> 00:21:12,727
[SPEAKER_01]: So we pull all the numbers, the numbers will be posted, and no one's name is affiliated with the number.

172
00:21:13,148 --> 00:21:17,011
[SPEAKER_01]: But you have your personalized number, so that will happen.

173
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:18,031
[SPEAKER_01]: Ms.

174
00:21:18,051 --> 00:21:25,117
[SPEAKER_01]: Demos, I'm not sure if you wanted to speak.

175
00:21:27,198 --> 00:21:28,639
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just here for the excitement.

176
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,441
[SPEAKER_01]: All of them.

177
00:21:31,501 --> 00:21:32,501
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

178
00:21:32,982 --> 00:21:33,862
[SPEAKER_01]: Equally excited.

179
00:21:34,322 --> 00:21:41,547
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, principals will be receiving the list as well to be able to confirm once it's done.

180
00:21:42,808 --> 00:21:49,572
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was looking to see if I saw a different administrator, but miss demos, I think you are on the call today.

181
00:21:49,672 --> 00:21:52,374
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for representing all of our elementary principals.

182
00:21:53,382 --> 00:21:56,564
[SPEAKER_01]: And, ah, Principal O'Brien, there you are.

183
00:21:56,584 --> 00:21:57,344
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't see you.

184
00:21:57,624 --> 00:21:59,425
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you like to speak, Principal O'Brien?

185
00:22:00,126 --> 00:22:02,107
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly, Dr. Edwards.

186
00:22:02,167 --> 00:22:09,171
[SPEAKER_00]: Congratulations to all our fifth grade kiddos who are about to find out where they will be attending middle school next year.

187
00:22:09,891 --> 00:22:11,252
[SPEAKER_00]: Very happy for you all.

188
00:22:12,633 --> 00:22:13,893
[SPEAKER_01]: Super, super happy.

189
00:22:13,953 --> 00:22:14,474
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

190
00:22:15,255 --> 00:22:22,721
[SPEAKER_01]: Principal O'Brien, there was a wonderful question asking, where is it gonna appear?

191
00:22:22,901 --> 00:22:27,464
[SPEAKER_01]: So our website team, we're gonna be working with them.

192
00:22:27,784 --> 00:22:32,968
[SPEAKER_01]: They're gonna try to have it prominent, like a button or something like that.

193
00:22:33,008 --> 00:22:43,276
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you go to the main page, there will be something that is gonna say middle school lottery, and then you'll be able to go into that

194
00:22:44,041 --> 00:22:49,504
[SPEAKER_01]: and we will have that information available front and center.

195
00:22:49,544 --> 00:22:53,006
[SPEAKER_01]: So you will not go on a wild goose chase.

196
00:22:53,506 --> 00:22:59,410
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to Medford Public Schools, our main website, and you'll be able to do it that way.

197
00:23:03,272 --> 00:23:04,913
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just trying to look at...

198
00:23:08,508 --> 00:23:10,669
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I want to say thank you.

199
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:12,811
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see the number.

207
00:23:46,238 --> 00:23:48,300
