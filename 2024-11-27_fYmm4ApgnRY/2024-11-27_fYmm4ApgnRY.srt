26
00:17:47,214 --> 00:17:52,398

[SPEAKER_07]: Call 781-393-2501 for any aids and accommodations.

32
00:18:09,538 --> 00:18:12,360
[SPEAKER_07]: Order of the Redford City Council, Adam Hurtubise, City Clerk.

33
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:16,003
[SPEAKER_07]: And I will turn it over to our assessor, Mr. Costigan.

34
00:18:18,024 --> 00:18:19,325
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, appreciate that.

35
00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:24,281
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you to Council for meeting this week.

36
00:18:24,862 --> 00:18:27,784
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's a busy week but this really does give the

37
00:18:29,602 --> 00:18:35,143
[SPEAKER_02]: the department and the treasurer of the city enough time to get this tax rate approved by the DOR.

38
00:18:35,183 --> 00:18:44,206
[SPEAKER_02]: Any questions they have back to us that we have a few days to answer them and get the tax rate, the tax bills out on time before the first of the year.

39
00:18:44,226 --> 00:18:48,707
[SPEAKER_02]: So I really, really appreciate you meeting today and not pushing it forward a week.

40
00:18:49,427 --> 00:18:55,449
[SPEAKER_02]: So the purpose of this hearing is to adopt the city's tax policy.

41
00:18:55,569 --> 00:18:56,769
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoops, thank you.

42
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:03,804
[SPEAKER_02]: by allocating their classifying the tax levy amongst the commercial and the residential class.

43
00:19:03,824 --> 00:19:14,029
[SPEAKER_02]: So typically in the past in Medford, we have shifted that tax burden from the residential class to the commercial class at the maximum allowable shift.

44
00:19:17,051 --> 00:19:18,792
[SPEAKER_02]: Great, all the PowerPoint perfect.

45
00:19:20,093 --> 00:19:21,674
[SPEAKER_02]: So on the third page,

46
00:19:28,911 --> 00:19:34,213
[SPEAKER_02]: And as mentioning in prior years, we've gone to that 175% shift of the levy.

47
00:19:35,653 --> 00:19:41,495
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we'll also vote, council will vote on the residential exemption as well as the small commercial exemption.

48
00:19:43,175 --> 00:19:52,218
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to recap this fiscal year on the next slide, the previous one, sorry, or not.

49
00:19:52,793 --> 00:19:53,253
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't make it.

50
00:19:53,273 --> 00:19:54,594
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a hidden one.

51
00:19:54,754 --> 00:19:54,994
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

52
00:19:55,014 --> 00:19:56,334
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a hidden one.

53
00:19:56,454 --> 00:19:57,254
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just the budget.

54
00:19:57,374 --> 00:19:59,675
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically reminding council that, yep, that's it right there.

55
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:03,676
[SPEAKER_02]: So just reminding council of our $211 million in the budget, 153.5 of that comes from property taxes.

56
00:20:03,696 --> 00:20:06,017
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's about 72% of all revenues in the city.

57
00:20:17,281 --> 00:20:21,603
[SPEAKER_02]: How we arrive at assessments is based on fair cash value.

58
00:20:22,123 --> 00:20:34,266
[SPEAKER_02]: We look at calendar year 2023 sales to determine our fiscal year 25 fair cash values, all of our valuations of commercial, industrial, and residential properties.

59
00:20:35,446 --> 00:20:38,947
[SPEAKER_02]: We are required by Mass General Law to be between 90 and 110% in the assessment to sales ratio.

60
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:48,959
[SPEAKER_02]: And on the next slide, I'll show you those ratios, but we were approved by the Massachusetts DOR in October of these values.

61
00:20:48,979 --> 00:20:52,684
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's a little hard to see, but this just kind of proves out the point in the left column.

62
00:20:53,305 --> 00:20:54,888
[SPEAKER_02]: We have just over 7,800 single families.

63
00:20:57,492 --> 00:20:58,773
[SPEAKER_02]: single family homes in Medford.

64
00:20:59,713 --> 00:21:05,855
[SPEAKER_02]: We have 255 sales in calendar year 23, 195 of which were arm's length.

65
00:21:06,156 --> 00:21:07,616
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what we use for our analysis.

66
00:21:08,116 --> 00:21:12,098
[SPEAKER_02]: Arms length transactions where a motivated buyer and a motivated seller meet at a price point.

67
00:21:14,847 --> 00:21:17,988
[SPEAKER_02]: On those, we were at a 97% assessment to sale ratio.

68
00:21:18,769 --> 00:21:25,792
[SPEAKER_02]: So often, council may ask, well, why is the valuation on their tax assessment lower than what they actually paid?

69
00:21:26,292 --> 00:21:28,173
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, it's a year back.

70
00:21:28,193 --> 00:21:29,293
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're calendar year 23.

71
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:35,095
[SPEAKER_02]: And second of all, we are at that 90, the average value is gonna be the 97% assessment sale ratio.

72
00:21:37,856 --> 00:21:39,017
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go on the next page.

73
00:21:39,057 --> 00:21:41,298
[SPEAKER_02]: Just wanna go through our assessment review.

74
00:21:42,038 --> 00:21:43,499
[SPEAKER_02]: Single families increased

75
00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:46,771
[SPEAKER_02]: about four and a half percent this year.

76
00:21:47,351 --> 00:21:49,233
[SPEAKER_02]: Condominiums were up five and a half.

77
00:21:50,554 --> 00:21:54,537
[SPEAKER_02]: Two families and three families, about seven, as well as commercial properties.

78
00:21:55,077 --> 00:21:56,238
[SPEAKER_02]: Apartments were only up one.

79
00:21:56,699 --> 00:21:59,981
[SPEAKER_02]: That's probably due to an interest rate environment that's changing right now.

80
00:22:00,982 --> 00:22:05,105
[SPEAKER_02]: Industrials were up about five percent and personal property was down a little bit.

81
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:13,409
[SPEAKER_02]: On to the next slide, just looking at our surrounding communities and average assessed values, you can see where Medford fits in.

82
00:22:14,689 --> 00:22:22,853
[SPEAKER_02]: If you just look at the single family and condos, sort of in between Somerville and Everett, and you can see the other surrounding communities.

83
00:22:25,274 --> 00:22:34,698
[SPEAKER_02]: On the next slide, just looking again at that fiscal year change, you can see how we compare and change to the other communities and what they're seeing in their sales markets.

84
00:22:39,448 --> 00:22:43,673
[SPEAKER_02]: Part of what we do in addition to valuing is valuing new growth.

85
00:22:44,053 --> 00:22:55,847
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the two gentlemen sitting behind me, Jared Yagen and Jim O'Brien do a heck of a job for the city in getting $2.5 million in new growth that adds to our levy.

86
00:22:56,408 --> 00:22:58,210
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a part of our tax base.

87
00:22:59,459 --> 00:23:08,427
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of the only ways that we can increase that revenue because of Prop 2.5, it's kind of limited at $2.5 million is on top of that Prop 2.5.

88
00:23:09,228 --> 00:23:13,031
[SPEAKER_02]: It was split roughly 1.5 million in commercial growth.

89
00:23:15,513 --> 00:23:18,816
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, 1.5 in residential growth and 1 million in commercial growth.

90
00:23:19,456 --> 00:23:26,322
[SPEAKER_02]: And it shows in the next slide how we kind of derive that using the prior tax rate and the new growth valuations.

91
00:23:29,113 --> 00:23:31,994
[SPEAKER_02]: On the following slide, we did a pretty good job this year, as I mentioned.

92
00:23:33,475 --> 00:23:36,476
[SPEAKER_02]: We were almost in line with last year.

93
00:23:37,376 --> 00:23:45,379
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, with permits being a little down this year, I would say we did a pretty good job at staying almost consistent on a year-on-year basis.

94
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:47,800
[SPEAKER_02]: So just next slide there.

95
00:23:50,622 --> 00:23:54,103
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see how it stacks up on previous years.

96
00:23:55,755 --> 00:24:02,017
[SPEAKER_02]: And the next slide, just looking at our fiscal year 2025 value by class.

97
00:24:02,077 --> 00:24:09,400
[SPEAKER_02]: So 90%, sorry, 88.9% of our value in the city of Medford is residential.

98
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:16,362
[SPEAKER_02]: The remaining roughly 9% is split between commercial, industrial, personal and property.

99
00:24:16,382 --> 00:24:23,604
[SPEAKER_02]: If you just said today, you know what, nice job assessors, we're just gonna do a flat rate.

100
00:24:23,684 --> 00:24:25,085
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not gonna shift any of the burden.

101
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:40,847
[SPEAKER_02]: we would just take the tax levy, we would divide it into the city taxable valuation, and we would get a flat rate of $9.70 per thousand that would be across all properties and personal property in Medford.

102
00:24:41,547 --> 00:24:46,610
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead, what this body has done in the past is shift that burden up to the full 175%.

103
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:51,552
[SPEAKER_02]: That means that the residential class will see an $8.80

104
00:24:53,952 --> 00:24:59,036
[SPEAKER_02]: tax rate while the commercial class will see a $16.94 tax rate.

105
00:24:59,076 --> 00:25:02,879
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is, you know, might round by a penny depending on our tax rate recap.

106
00:25:03,159 --> 00:25:04,780
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just, that's one caveat.

107
00:25:06,341 --> 00:25:11,865
[SPEAKER_02]: And historically on the next slide, you can see, again, we were about 89% residential.

108
00:25:12,325 --> 00:25:21,772
[SPEAKER_02]: It brings that burden on the residential taxpayer at about 80% and about 19% on the CIP, a commercial industrial personal property.

109
00:25:24,344 --> 00:25:40,199
[SPEAKER_02]: So we again in past in the next slide you'd see we in order to get to that 175 shift we select a minimum residential factor which is multiplied by the percentage of residential property so it's basically a point

110
00:25:42,325 --> 00:25:46,466
[SPEAKER_02]: 9072 multiplied by that 89% of the value.

111
00:25:47,007 --> 00:25:49,528
[SPEAKER_02]: And on the next slide, you can see what the outcome is.

112
00:25:49,608 --> 00:25:56,031
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, if we were at a flat 970, you can see a $9.70 or the flat one, it's a $9.70 tax rate for both.

113
00:25:56,051 --> 00:25:58,312
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you go to the max of the 175, 880 and 1694, respectively.

114
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,181
[SPEAKER_02]: What did this do to the average single family?

115
00:26:11,201 --> 00:26:21,184
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see in the next slide, by adopting this, you're effectively lowering the average single family tax bill from $7,800 to about $7,083.

116
00:26:21,264 --> 00:26:22,324
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the effect of the vote tonight.

117
00:26:30,529 --> 00:26:37,030
[SPEAKER_02]: On the next slide, you can see the sort of the history of the average single family tax bill.

118
00:26:38,271 --> 00:26:41,271
[SPEAKER_02]: This was obviously debated earlier this year, as the councilor was mentioning.

119
00:26:42,312 --> 00:26:47,933
[SPEAKER_02]: We are seeing a $532 increase in the average family tax bill.

120
00:26:48,173 --> 00:26:53,854
[SPEAKER_02]: As I testified about a month ago, about 330 of that 530 was due to the overrides that were passed by the voters.

121
00:26:58,615 --> 00:27:04,597
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's resulting in an 8% increase year over year in taxes, the average single family.

122
00:27:07,178 --> 00:27:11,039
[SPEAKER_02]: So that would be the first vote would be on the 175 shift.

123
00:27:11,059 --> 00:27:15,521
[SPEAKER_02]: And then on the next slide, the second vote would be the residential exemption.

124
00:27:16,681 --> 00:27:21,003
[SPEAKER_02]: Many communities do adopt the residential exemption, which is just within the residential class.

125
00:27:21,063 --> 00:27:27,005
[SPEAKER_02]: It basically pushes more of the burden of taxation onto the non-owner occupied

126
00:27:28,326 --> 00:27:39,830
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, properties across the city, um, that would result in, um, properties at under $982,000 paying effectively less than taxes.

127
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:43,831
[SPEAKER_02]: And those valued, uh, more than that paying more in taxes.

128
00:27:44,451 --> 00:27:53,674
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, this would have to be decided by the council, uh, earlier in the fiscal year in order to make this a possibility, uh, administratively.

129
00:27:55,590 --> 00:28:02,433
[SPEAKER_02]: On the next slide, for the small commercial exemption, the city has never adopted this due to its very limited effects.

130
00:28:02,734 --> 00:28:11,558
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be for owner-occupied businesses that have no more than 10 employees.

131
00:28:14,239 --> 00:28:22,803
[SPEAKER_02]: And just to summarize the three votes tonight, the selection of a minimum residential factor, which would shift at the maximum 175,

132
00:28:25,461 --> 00:28:30,987
[SPEAKER_02]: the commercial class, and then a vote on whether to adopt the residential exemption and the small commercial exemption.

133
00:28:31,568 --> 00:28:33,189
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll take any questions at this time.

134
00:28:35,071 --> 00:28:37,454
[SPEAKER_07]: Ted, we also have on the agenda the open space discount.

135
00:28:37,514 --> 00:28:38,515
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we need to vote on that?

136
00:28:40,257 --> 00:28:46,804
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually don't have open space, but we can vote against it, I suppose.

137
00:28:51,379 --> 00:28:53,900
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of a non-issue.

138
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:56,842
[SPEAKER_07]: But the recommendation would be to not- To not vote.

139
00:28:57,002 --> 00:28:58,543
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't see what this is correct.

140
00:28:58,883 --> 00:28:59,404
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

141
00:29:00,484 --> 00:29:03,000
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll go to- 

141
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,408
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Ted, for you and your team.

142
00:29:06,448 --> 00:29:08,770
[SPEAKER_12]: I know you guys have been super busy.

143
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:13,733
[SPEAKER_12]: But again, I think that questions people ask, usually this is later in the year.

144
00:29:13,813 --> 00:29:18,256
[SPEAKER_12]: So I would assume that this is tied into what's gonna happen in January.

145
00:29:18,769 --> 00:29:22,674
[SPEAKER_12]: which is the increase of the override to people's taxes.

146
00:29:22,734 --> 00:29:26,580
[SPEAKER_12]: So the phone calls I received, should we come to these meetings, can we stop it?

147
00:29:27,216 --> 00:29:43,187
[SPEAKER_12]: And I tried to explain to residents that, you know, so they can understand in layman terms that this is a tax rate that we are not going to put forth and whatever this council decides, plus what the override is.

148
00:29:43,227 --> 00:29:49,652
[SPEAKER_12]: So someone that's a million dollar home, you'll see, you know, that 7,800, 7,500 a year tax now then increased another, I know one resident

149
00:29:54,815 --> 00:29:59,776
[SPEAKER_12]: was quoted about $800 for their home for an addition on top of that.

150
00:29:59,856 --> 00:30:03,197
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think this is why people are asking, why are we doing this meeting?

151
00:30:03,237 --> 00:30:12,379
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's, you know, I want to make sure it's clear that we're doing this so we can, that we give your team enough time to set this rate, then we can move forward.

152
00:30:12,419 --> 00:30:14,820
[SPEAKER_12]: So in January, everything will be in place.

153
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:19,621
[SPEAKER_12]: So just to let everybody know, it is happening in January that the override

154
00:30:20,929 --> 00:30:32,698
[SPEAKER_12]: increase will be added in top of this, which the rates were, the new assessment, like was said, was assessed from the 2023 sales home sales, right?

155
00:30:32,898 --> 00:30:33,639
[SPEAKER_12]: So, okay.

156
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:37,782
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's one thing I wanted to make sure that everybody knows.

157
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:44,728
[SPEAKER_12]: And that, again, to be clear, this is year after year that the override tax doesn't disappear.

158
00:30:45,348 --> 00:30:49,492
[SPEAKER_12]: This just increases plus two and a half percent, if that so be it, every year to follow.

159
00:30:50,693 --> 00:30:54,295
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that's what the questions were.

160
00:30:55,176 --> 00:31:11,727
[SPEAKER_12]: And then the other thing that's confusing people when you talk about new growth, when you hear new growth in communities that have a booming commercial base or you're seeing a new tax revenue coming from new development,

161
00:31:12,407 --> 00:31:15,449
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the new growth we haven't seen much in Medford.

162
00:31:15,509 --> 00:31:26,115
[SPEAKER_12]: So I want people to understand the new growth that we've been talking about during the override, it's new growth coming from increasing taxes that we see as the levy increases.

163
00:31:28,615 --> 00:31:29,936
[SPEAKER_12]: So I want people to understand that.

164
00:31:29,976 --> 00:31:31,677
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think that was very important.

165
00:31:32,158 --> 00:31:42,226
[SPEAKER_12]: That was a question that's been brought up saying that, oh no, they've heard from some councils that said that Medford was number one in Massachusetts in new growth, which isn't true.

166
00:31:42,286 --> 00:31:48,991
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just wanted to make sure that those points were just brought up tonight.

167
00:31:49,251 --> 00:31:51,313
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's a different new growth

168
00:31:51,903 --> 00:31:58,007
[SPEAKER_12]: we talk about new growth and development is very different than what you talked about tonight, and new growth and tax assessment.

169
00:31:58,047 --> 00:31:59,948
[SPEAKER_12]: So am I correct with that?

170
00:31:59,968 --> 00:32:00,789
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't want to speak for you.

171
00:32:00,809 --> 00:32:10,395
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, yeah, new growth is just permitted, generally permitted work or any non-permitted work that was not on their assessment.

172
00:32:10,755 --> 00:32:15,678
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, the last year, and we usually Jared or Jim will go out and they'll go to a permit and

173
00:32:16,582 --> 00:32:18,723
[SPEAKER_02]: revalue the property due to that.

174
00:32:18,903 --> 00:32:19,883
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's that.

175
00:32:20,724 --> 00:32:20,884
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

176
00:32:20,964 --> 00:32:22,364
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a new assessment.

177
00:32:22,444 --> 00:32:22,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

178
00:32:22,785 --> 00:32:26,566
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if an exempt property were to become taxable, that would be new growth.

179
00:32:26,826 --> 00:32:27,106
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

180
00:32:27,586 --> 00:32:36,010
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I think that the last piece is what everybody's asking for now is what Mr. Castagnetti has been saying for years is the owner occupied.

181
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:38,391
[SPEAKER_12]: I know it's a slippery slope because it sounds so easy.

182
00:32:38,991 --> 00:32:46,014
[SPEAKER_12]: So my neighbor who's 86 years old said, George, if this, if you vote in the tax exemption, I'm living a single family home.

183
00:32:46,969 --> 00:32:53,497
[SPEAKER_12]: If I'm if the exemption goes through for homeowners and I get my taxes would be lower than what they were in the previous years.

184
00:32:54,078 --> 00:32:57,582
[SPEAKER_12]: I said that's true, but when you look at the way we look at the big picture.

185
00:32:59,064 --> 00:32:59,705
[SPEAKER_12]: It affects.

186
00:33:01,348 --> 00:33:04,151
[SPEAKER_12]: majority of our residents in a negative way, correct?

187
00:33:04,631 --> 00:33:06,132
[SPEAKER_12]: Their tax will increase even higher.

188
00:33:06,152 --> 00:33:10,496
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so the break even was prepared about 982,000.

189
00:33:11,196 --> 00:33:21,344
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, you're typically what happens is your condo class, its value lower, let's say 500,000 is going to see a lot of that value exempted and see a lower overall.

190
00:33:21,364 --> 00:33:27,729
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're in a two or three family, typically it would result even if you were owner occupied in a higher tax bill.

191
00:33:28,069 --> 00:33:28,590
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

192
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:32,154
[SPEAKER_02]: yet it shifts the burden from the lower value to the higher value.

193
00:33:32,174 --> 00:33:34,337
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you can help.

194
00:33:39,127 --> 00:33:41,588
[SPEAKER_12]: Because the word is out that Somerville does it, Cambridge does it.

195
00:33:42,048 --> 00:33:43,789
[SPEAKER_12]: Why is it beneficial for their communities?

196
00:33:43,829 --> 00:33:46,470
[SPEAKER_12]: What do they have that we don't that allows them to do that?

197
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:55,034
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, their break-even is going to be a lot higher because of their higher valuations and their more robust apartment class.

198
00:33:55,694 --> 00:33:58,395
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's more to shift onto.

199
00:33:58,495 --> 00:33:59,115
[SPEAKER_02]: Spread out more.

200
00:33:59,275 --> 00:33:59,896
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

201
00:34:00,156 --> 00:34:03,477
[SPEAKER_12]: So typically, communities like that will adopt it.

202
00:34:03,857 --> 00:34:04,097
[SPEAKER_12]: OK.

203
00:34:04,478 --> 00:34:05,058
[SPEAKER_12]: I appreciate you.

204
00:34:05,578 --> 00:34:08,000
[SPEAKER_12]: appreciate all the hard work you guys, your team has done.

205
00:34:08,081 --> 00:34:10,002
[SPEAKER_12]: It's been, uh, I know it's been trying.

206
00:34:10,022 --> 00:34:29,180
[SPEAKER_12]: I know that you were on the hot seat a month ago and I apologize for any, any, um, you know, um, uncomfortable questions that were asked, but I know it was, you stood there and did a wonderful job and, and, uh, we, you know, appreciate getting that out the Friday, the week before, so people can get a better understanding of what it looked like.

207
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:29,741
[SPEAKER_12]: So, um,

208
00:34:30,390 --> 00:34:33,111
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that's why we had such a close vote.

209
00:34:33,371 --> 00:34:39,735
[SPEAKER_12]: It was very close because of that fact that people started realizing the true numbers and the effects that we're gonna have on the homeowners.

210
00:34:39,775 --> 00:34:41,035
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you so much.

211
00:34:41,515 --> 00:34:41,916
[SPEAKER_12]: Absolutely.

212
00:34:43,416 --> 00:34:44,457
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

213
00:34:45,357 --> 00:34:46,858
[SPEAKER_07]: Ted, just a couple of quick questions.

214
00:34:48,819 --> 00:34:54,942
[SPEAKER_07]: On this new growth here on the chart, this is new construction.

215
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:57,350
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a number of things.

216
00:34:57,470 --> 00:35:01,812
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be like a condo conversion, the net of a condo conversion.

217
00:35:01,832 --> 00:35:04,292
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be any new construction.

218
00:35:04,532 --> 00:35:11,115
[SPEAKER_02]: So if it was a new plan development, it can be any exempt property that becomes taxable on tax rolls.

219
00:35:11,135 --> 00:35:12,975
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a number of things.

220
00:35:12,995 --> 00:35:14,896
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, generally, permitted construction.

221
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:16,900
[SPEAKER_07]: That'd be accurate.

222
00:35:16,941 --> 00:35:24,787
[SPEAKER_07]: This year, how much of it was like a condo conversion or an exempt building coming on versus just new building or major renovations?

223
00:35:25,148 --> 00:35:30,632
[SPEAKER_02]: We had on just actually the next slide would actually help you help me answer that.

224
00:35:32,354 --> 00:35:33,635
[SPEAKER_02]: Or sorry about the previous slide.

225
00:35:34,416 --> 00:35:39,981
[SPEAKER_02]: So roughly, you can see kind of how it's broken down.

226
00:35:40,717 --> 00:35:55,601
[SPEAKER_02]: So single-family, we did have a development up on Winthrop, kind of a number of new single-families, but most of that single-family new growth valuation is from additions, renovations of existing single-family homes.

227
00:35:56,241 --> 00:36:02,163
[SPEAKER_02]: The vast, vast majority of that condominium new growth valuation is from Kona conversions.

228
00:36:03,072 --> 00:36:10,757
[SPEAKER_02]: The twos and threes and really four families, that's going to be renovations and so on and so forth with that.

229
00:36:11,098 --> 00:36:22,085
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, of that 1.5 of the 2.5 on the residential side, mostly single family permits, condo conversions, and two and three family permits.

230
00:36:23,046 --> 00:36:25,168
[SPEAKER_02]: Some new construction there.

231
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:27,209
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that much, but some new construction.

232
00:36:30,445 --> 00:36:30,926
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that all?

233
00:36:31,066 --> 00:36:36,111
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there were several exempt to taxable properties.

234
00:36:36,631 --> 00:36:37,973
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, yeah.

235
00:36:39,194 --> 00:36:43,959
[SPEAKER_07]: And are we getting better at capturing that or what's changing to drive the new growth numbers higher?

236
00:36:44,226 --> 00:36:47,788
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think we got a really efficient process.

237
00:36:48,388 --> 00:36:53,170
[SPEAKER_02]: We are also working in tandem with our fiscal year 26 reval.

238
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:59,333
[SPEAKER_02]: So every five years, the Department of Revenue makes the assessing departments revalue the whole community.

239
00:36:59,373 --> 00:37:02,835
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have to have a 10 year look back where we've gone to every single property.

240
00:37:03,515 --> 00:37:05,696
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, like this year,

241
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,542
[SPEAKER_02]: the assessing team has gone to over 7,000 properties.

242
00:37:09,962 --> 00:37:24,030
[SPEAKER_02]: So in that, if I tell our assessing team, if you're at a property and you see a finished attic that wasn't there before, and you're talking to homeowners, we have to make adjustments to the property record card to reflect that.

243
00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:29,753
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're trying to get accurate data and the valuations will follow that accurate data.

244
00:37:31,934 --> 00:37:34,276
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks, just one more question on the residential exemption.

245
00:37:35,323 --> 00:37:37,125
[SPEAKER_07]: The break even seemed a lot higher this year.

246
00:37:37,145 --> 00:37:41,228
[SPEAKER_07]: I think last time we talked it was in the high 700s, low 800s.

247
00:37:41,268 --> 00:37:46,091
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that just a major change in valuations or what happened there?

248
00:37:46,872 --> 00:37:47,132
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

249
00:37:47,152 --> 00:37:59,621
[SPEAKER_02]: So over the last two years, probably since we last talked about that, I mean, we haven't seen year on year increase in valuation, you know, probably I have to go back through the numbers, but let's say two years at, you know, over 10%.

250
00:38:02,549 --> 00:38:06,351
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have to look, it depends on what you shifted at.

251
00:38:06,531 --> 00:38:09,833
[SPEAKER_02]: So in other words, what what owner occupancy we assume.

252
00:38:10,474 --> 00:38:19,779
[SPEAKER_02]: So are we assuming that, you know, Medford residential parcels are 80% owner occupied or 70% and that's going to move the number as well.

253
00:38:19,799 --> 00:38:19,839
[SPEAKER_02]: So

254
00:38:20,731 --> 00:38:28,157
[SPEAKER_02]: I know in communities that have them, it's sometimes surprising because you'd say, okay, single families, there must be 95% occupied.

255
00:38:28,217 --> 00:38:35,183
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if you own the home in a trust and you're not the trust and the beneficiary, you wouldn't be eligible for that residential exemption.

256
00:38:36,144 --> 00:38:47,693
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if you own the house in an LLC, or if the, not that people vacation in Medford often, but if you did have a second home and chose that to be, Medford to be your second home.

257
00:38:49,352 --> 00:38:49,632
[SPEAKER_07]: Got it.

258
00:38:49,712 --> 00:38:52,894
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know you gave us the average single family value was 804.

259
00:38:53,074 --> 00:38:54,554
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have the median?

260
00:38:56,675 --> 00:39:01,117
[SPEAKER_02]: The median tends to be lower, I'm going to say.

261
00:39:04,158 --> 00:39:07,280
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I believe it's slightly, I always screw this up, but right skewed data.

262
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:11,982
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, we can get that for you tomorrow, the median versus the average.

263
00:39:12,022 --> 00:39:15,023
[SPEAKER_02]: But it tends to be, I want to say it's lower.

264
00:39:20,031 --> 00:39:21,472
[SPEAKER_02]: It was 768.

265
00:39:23,312 --> 00:39:23,532
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

266
00:39:24,093 --> 00:39:25,013
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes, there you go.

267
00:39:25,453 --> 00:39:25,813
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

268
00:39:26,874 --> 00:39:31,555
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so it is skewed from a Belker perspective.

269
00:39:31,615 --> 00:39:34,777
[SPEAKER_02]: So 768 versus 804 is the average.

270
00:39:35,677 --> 00:39:35,957
[SPEAKER_07]: Got it.

271
00:39:36,077 --> 00:39:36,257
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

272
00:39:36,317 --> 00:39:40,579
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just say that because I think it would be valuable in the future if we could get

273
00:39:41,323 --> 00:39:46,166
[SPEAKER_07]: figures on the number of residential parcels that fall below the break-even point and then those that fall above.

274
00:39:46,586 --> 00:39:47,126
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

275
00:39:47,186 --> 00:39:53,830
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I think the council has expressed interest in the residential exemption and would want to have those discussions.

276
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:54,610
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

277
00:39:56,091 --> 00:39:56,351
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks.

278
00:39:56,431 --> 00:39:59,013
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll go to Councilor Tseng then Councilor Callaghan.

279
00:40:00,974 --> 00:40:07,777
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, I think you had asked the main questions I had about the residential tax exemption.

280
00:40:09,969 --> 00:40:19,795
[SPEAKER_08]: Could you, I know you talked about how we would need more time to set it up if the council wanted to pursue this option.

281
00:40:19,835 --> 00:40:30,142
[SPEAKER_08]: Could you give us a more concrete idea, or just in general, how many, if you need more FDEs, more full-time staff working on something like this, what that process would look like?

282
00:40:30,382 --> 00:40:38,684
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be really front loaded in the sense that we would need an application from what we think is nine or 10,000 applicants across the city.

283
00:40:39,884 --> 00:40:45,026
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's processing to make sure that they are owner occupants.

284
00:40:45,246 --> 00:40:59,229
[SPEAKER_02]: So typically it would involve them submitting application with a form, their page one of their Massachusetts tax return showing that they are filing, it's redacted, but they're filing their Medford address.

285
00:41:00,104 --> 00:41:10,073
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd have to kind of think about it, but I would say probably a full-time employee would need to get 10,000 applications in year one.

286
00:41:10,913 --> 00:41:24,505
[SPEAKER_02]: And then on a rolling basis, we would need verification on a rolling basis to make sure that the individuals receiving are still living in the home.

287
00:41:25,789 --> 00:41:32,170
[SPEAKER_08]: I know a concern that some have with a residential tax exemption is that it would disproportionately affect renters.

288
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:37,851
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that something that, could you explain that a little bit?

289
00:41:37,871 --> 00:41:38,551
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

290
00:41:38,791 --> 00:41:47,093
[SPEAKER_08]: And could you maybe explain that in the context of the cities around us that do do a residential tax exemption?

291
00:41:47,733 --> 00:41:51,813
[SPEAKER_08]: You mentioned that there's some things that they do that put them in a different spot than us.

292
00:41:52,434 --> 00:41:55,094
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was wondering if you could delve into a little bit of detail about that.

293
00:41:55,174 --> 00:41:56,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.

294
00:41:56,194 --> 00:42:02,396
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are a number of economic theories that would show, well, it's not an economic theory.

295
00:42:02,416 --> 00:42:10,419
[SPEAKER_02]: If you do a residential exemption, it pushes up a higher tax burden to all apartments, assuming that the apartments aren't owner-occupied.

296
00:42:10,779 --> 00:42:18,882
[SPEAKER_02]: So typically, it's going to jump up the taxes on larger apartment buildings by a good amount.

297
00:42:19,762 --> 00:42:22,344
[SPEAKER_02]: the tax rate shift is, you know, significant.

298
00:42:22,864 --> 00:42:28,827
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's say, you know, it's a 10 or 15% shift in tax rate up on large apartment buildings.

299
00:42:30,028 --> 00:42:36,471
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of depends if you think, do they just pay for that and or do they try to raise rents to meet it?

300
00:42:36,611 --> 00:42:41,074
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's literature that shows if you're at the market rent, how much higher can they go?

301
00:42:41,769 --> 00:42:48,831
[SPEAKER_02]: And this literature shows that, you know, that landlords do try their darndest to push that tax burden on to the renters.

302
00:42:49,952 --> 00:42:56,734
[SPEAKER_02]: Another unintended consequence that you would probably see in communities that do have the residential exemption is

303
00:42:57,799 --> 00:43:00,620
[SPEAKER_02]: it does incentivize what you just talked about is condoizing.

304
00:43:01,181 --> 00:43:13,706
[SPEAKER_02]: So every time we have a three, you know, or a single family or two family or three family that condoizes, that's just a, you know, it's beneficial for them to do that with a Res-X because they're going to have a much lower tax bill.

305
00:43:14,327 --> 00:43:15,567
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that create housing stock?

306
00:43:15,587 --> 00:43:17,428
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it not, you know,

307
00:43:17,959 --> 00:43:19,761
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes apartments will condoize that way.

308
00:43:20,321 --> 00:43:29,429
[SPEAKER_02]: So that can be, depending on what policy outcome you want, that can be an unintended consequences that you see more of a push to condos given the lower tax burden.

309
00:43:31,070 --> 00:43:46,723
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it basically is a general shift from your condo and sort of lower value single families onto your apartment class and potentially three family and four family homes.

310
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:48,981
[SPEAKER_08]: See, thank you so much.

311
00:43:53,324 --> 00:43:54,144
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, one second.

312
00:43:55,805 --> 00:43:57,466
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, the second part of that question.

313
00:43:59,588 --> 00:44:10,095
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there are there economic like, reasons why or contextual reasons why other cities around us have adopted the residential exemption?

314
00:44:11,455 --> 00:44:15,418
[SPEAKER_08]: Or is it mainly just political in your in your study of things?

315
00:44:18,022 --> 00:44:31,847
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I think in communities that have a significant, um, income producing apartment, um, stock, you know, double or triple what Medford would have.

316
00:44:32,748 --> 00:44:39,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it becomes, um, an option that's more palatable because your break even tends to be higher.

317
00:44:41,031 --> 00:44:46,853
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's, you know, it, it creates a situation where like, if you, if council here were to pass it, most

318
00:44:48,874 --> 00:44:54,696
[SPEAKER_02]: two and three family owners would probably see a tax increase.

319
00:44:55,316 --> 00:45:13,322
[SPEAKER_02]: In other communities that have more residential value that is in the apartment class, it kind of pushes up that number possibly, and more number of apartments too, because it's the median that you're looking at.

320
00:45:13,342 --> 00:45:14,903
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's the median value, yeah.

321
00:45:15,543 --> 00:45:15,783
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

322
00:45:17,978 --> 00:45:19,739
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you'll go to Councilor Callahan.

323
00:45:19,759 --> 00:45:22,600
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

324
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:27,642
[SPEAKER_05]: As everyone has already said, thank you so much for all your work so far this season.

325
00:45:27,662 --> 00:45:29,143
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot going on for you, I know.

326
00:45:29,163 --> 00:45:30,984
[SPEAKER_05]: And thank you for being here.

327
00:45:31,897 --> 00:45:45,267
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I have some numbers that are from housing Medford, and I just want to ask you if you think this is like close to accurate that we have approximately 47% single family homes, we have about 32% that have two to four units.

328
00:45:51,004 --> 00:46:00,308
[SPEAKER_05]: We have about 2.5% that have five to nine units, about 2.5% that have 10 to 19 units, and 15% or so that have more than 20 units.

329
00:46:00,488 --> 00:46:10,193
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so if you just go, President Bears, just to that slide on, I think it's slide five or six, there's a property assessment review.

330
00:46:11,393 --> 00:46:13,114
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll be able to see the breakdown.

331
00:46:13,714 --> 00:46:15,275
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, when I say see, it's kind of small.

332
00:46:15,735 --> 00:46:19,217
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, the city of Manfred has roughly

333
00:46:20,061 --> 00:46:22,842
[SPEAKER_02]: 18,000 parcels.

334
00:46:23,302 --> 00:46:24,403
[SPEAKER_02]: 78, 58 are single family.

335
00:46:25,643 --> 00:46:28,384
[SPEAKER_02]: 37, 13 are condo.

336
00:46:29,424 --> 00:46:33,645
[SPEAKER_02]: The next one, there's 24, and those are like multiple single families on one parcel.

337
00:46:34,066 --> 00:46:34,426
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

338
00:46:34,526 --> 00:46:35,426
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you explain this a little bit?

339
00:46:35,446 --> 00:46:37,287
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I just see these columns are like 101, 102.

340
00:46:37,867 --> 00:46:39,667
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so sorry.

341
00:46:39,907 --> 00:46:41,428
[SPEAKER_02]: 101 is the single family.

342
00:46:42,908 --> 00:46:44,469
[SPEAKER_02]: 102 is condo class.

343
00:46:44,629 --> 00:46:47,570
[SPEAKER_02]: These are just state use codes that they make us use.

344
00:46:48,427 --> 00:46:53,910
[SPEAKER_02]: The 109s are the two, typically two single families on one parcel.

345
00:46:53,930 --> 00:46:54,971
[SPEAKER_02]: There's only 24 in the entire city.

346
00:46:55,011 --> 00:46:57,572
[SPEAKER_02]: The 104s are the two families.

347
00:46:57,592 --> 00:46:57,892
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's 3881.

348
00:46:57,932 --> 00:46:59,273
[SPEAKER_02]: The 105s are the three families.

349
00:46:59,293 --> 00:46:59,453
[SPEAKER_02]: There's 461.

350
00:46:59,493 --> 00:47:00,654
[SPEAKER_02]: The 111, 112s are the four family and up.

351
00:47:00,674 --> 00:47:03,895
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's gonna be as many as like 350 unit apartment buildings.

352
00:47:03,915 --> 00:47:04,416
[SPEAKER_02]: There's 116 of those.

353
00:47:17,093 --> 00:47:25,040
[SPEAKER_02]: There's 693 130s, which are vacant land parcels.

354
00:47:25,901 --> 00:47:33,328
[SPEAKER_02]: There are 593 commercial parcels and 84 industrial parcels.

355
00:47:34,429 --> 00:47:39,814
[SPEAKER_02]: Not listed here are the exempt parcels because we value them, but they're not taxable.

356
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:43,502
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, so what I'm looking for is percentage of the residential.

357
00:47:43,742 --> 00:47:46,564
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's hard to find that in this document.

358
00:47:47,505 --> 00:47:53,709
[SPEAKER_05]: What I'm trying to understand and what I have from Housing Medford, which I'm asking you if it's relatively close, is of our residential.

359
00:47:54,069 --> 00:47:55,550
[SPEAKER_05]: We're talking about a residential.

360
00:47:56,991 --> 00:48:00,473
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to compare residential to residential in this particular case.

361
00:48:02,094 --> 00:48:07,798
[SPEAKER_05]: So that almost half of our residential, less than half is single families.

362
00:48:09,079 --> 00:48:11,641
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so I'd have to do the math quick.

363
00:48:11,841 --> 00:48:25,690
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have it right with me, but if we added up all these going across up to the commercial and industrial, I believe we have, don't quote me, I'll give you the number tomorrow, like 14 or 15,000 residential parcels.

364
00:48:25,730 --> 00:48:26,310
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that about right?

365
00:48:26,330 --> 00:48:27,191
[SPEAKER_02]: 15,000 residential parcels?

366
00:48:28,564 --> 00:48:29,264
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we can do the math.

367
00:48:29,345 --> 00:48:39,071
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, yeah, so about half, 7,800 of the, and don't quote me, but it's right around 15,000 to 16,000 residential parcels.

368
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:40,732
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can get you the exact numbers tomorrow.

369
00:48:41,012 --> 00:48:42,173
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, well, we have to vote today.

370
00:48:42,493 --> 00:48:44,254
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm trying to kind of understand this.

371
00:48:44,314 --> 00:48:49,958
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so- For this discussion, rather than waiting until after we have the vote, I'd like to have that information for this discussion.

372
00:48:50,539 --> 00:48:55,522
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so if you let me go downstairs, I can print it out and I could come back in about five minutes.

373
00:48:56,658 --> 00:49:01,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, maybe I can ask a couple other questions first, so we can have everything at the same time.

374
00:49:02,663 --> 00:49:12,890
[SPEAKER_05]: The way that I'm looking at it, and I understand the arguments for that if you're above the threshold, then your taxes will go up.

375
00:49:12,930 --> 00:49:15,372
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're below the threshold, probably your taxes will go down.

376
00:49:17,990 --> 00:49:25,772
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems to me that we have, it looks like, just under 50% that are single family.

377
00:49:26,132 --> 00:49:29,413
[SPEAKER_05]: Those people are almost all certainly Medford residents.

378
00:49:30,473 --> 00:49:35,295
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe 30% or so of our residential housing is between two and four units.

379
00:49:35,735 --> 00:49:37,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of those are going to be Medford residents.

380
00:49:37,855 --> 00:49:39,576
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of them are not going to be Medford residents.

381
00:49:40,896 --> 00:49:43,657
[SPEAKER_05]: And then 20% is five units or more.

382
00:49:44,177 --> 00:49:46,458
[SPEAKER_05]: And those are almost certainly not owner-occupied.

383
00:49:49,207 --> 00:50:03,136
[SPEAKER_05]: It sure seems to me that if we are looking at this from the sense of how can we benefit Medford residents and how can we especially benefit Medford residents who

384
00:50:05,842 --> 00:50:21,216
[SPEAKER_05]: Our working class are people who, you know, we have a really large cohort of people who moved here, when we were affordable, because this was where working class people could afford to buy, and those people most of them now are seniors, they're on fixed incomes.

385
00:50:25,134 --> 00:50:30,079
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I'm thinking about this a lot because today is when we're supposed to be voting on this residential exemption.

386
00:50:30,099 --> 00:50:40,630
[SPEAKER_05]: It is really our last chance to make a decision like this before the taxes from the Prop 2.5 override go up.

387
00:50:43,030 --> 00:50:54,298
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it really seems to me, and especially you have said that, what would happen is condos go down, single families, some would go down.

388
00:50:54,318 --> 00:51:03,545
[SPEAKER_05]: And then two and three families are the ones that are going to be starting to be the ones that are paying more, as well as the much larger properties.

389
00:51:06,038 --> 00:51:29,386
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, from my perspective, it really seems like we are now in that position, given the valuation that you, the sort of threshold of 982,000, that we really are gonna be benefiting almost all of our Medford residents, and certainly the ones who are most in need, by passing this residential exemption.

390
00:51:29,686 --> 00:51:34,388
[SPEAKER_05]: And so my second question for you, because I understand that,

391
00:51:38,892 --> 00:51:48,720
[SPEAKER_05]: it is considered that we would have had to do this earlier in the cycle in order for this to happen, but this was not on our agenda earlier in the cycle.

392
00:51:48,820 --> 00:52:05,173
[SPEAKER_05]: It sure seems to me that if the administration believes that this could not be voted on now, and it needed to be voted on six months earlier, then the administration should have put this on our agenda six months earlier.

393
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:14,061
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm having trouble with the fact that we are supposed to take a vote tonight, and yet we're told we cannot vote in there.

394
00:52:15,243 --> 00:52:15,924
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm not blaming you.

395
00:52:15,944 --> 00:52:16,464
[SPEAKER_05]: I apologize.

396
00:52:16,504 --> 00:52:18,546
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm looking at you, which I'm probably supposed to be looking at the chair.

397
00:52:19,227 --> 00:52:27,835
[SPEAKER_05]: In no way do I think this is, I hope you don't hear me as if I am putting this on you.

398
00:52:27,916 --> 00:52:28,356
[SPEAKER_05]: I am not.

399
00:52:28,997 --> 00:52:33,321
[SPEAKER_05]: But I do think that this is something that we are supposed to vote on.

400
00:52:33,581 --> 00:52:35,002
[SPEAKER_05]: It is our job to vote on this.

401
00:52:35,443 --> 00:52:37,145
[SPEAKER_05]: This is something I believe would benefit

402
00:52:39,019 --> 00:52:45,761
[SPEAKER_05]: almost all of the homeowners in Medford, except for those who own multifamilies and have some rental income.

403
00:52:47,642 --> 00:52:53,704
[SPEAKER_05]: And I am feeling frustrated that we are now told that we are not allowed to vote in favor.

404
00:52:54,564 --> 00:52:57,905
[SPEAKER_05]: So my question for you is, what would happen

405
00:52:59,449 --> 00:53:00,590
[SPEAKER_05]: if we voted in favor?

406
00:53:01,270 --> 00:53:03,091
[SPEAKER_05]: What would the city have to go through?

407
00:53:03,231 --> 00:53:13,396
[SPEAKER_05]: How much pain and difficulty and money would it cost if we voted in favor for the city to actually get this stuff done on time?

408
00:53:13,496 --> 00:53:17,718
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we hire enough consultants or full-time employees or whatever to make this thing happen?

409
00:53:17,998 --> 00:53:28,443
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so we would probably get about 10,000 applications between now and the April 1 deadline, which we'd have to process and award.

410
00:53:29,338 --> 00:53:35,421
[SPEAKER_02]: we would have to issue basically 10,000 reimbursements because we didn't do it by the tax rate setting.

411
00:53:35,922 --> 00:53:38,523
[SPEAKER_02]: So any residential exemption that comes

412
00:53:39,588 --> 00:53:45,930
[SPEAKER_02]: off the bill after the tax rate is done, which we have to do tonight to get it on the bills, has to come out of the overlay account.

413
00:53:46,530 --> 00:53:57,973
[SPEAKER_02]: So the city didn't, I guess, if you were to pass it, we wouldn't have predicted you passing it, and we wouldn't be able to fund the reimbursements we would owe people from the residential exemption.

414
00:53:57,993 --> 00:54:04,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that, or possibly, because I don't know, I have to look at the numbers and see what the overlay account would be able to fund.

415
00:54:04,514 --> 00:54:07,175
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you talk a little bit more about the overlay account?

416
00:54:07,679 --> 00:54:18,605
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so overlay account, every municipality has, it is money that, you know, through the budget process, we put away every year in case we overvalue properties, right?

417
00:54:18,625 --> 00:54:26,689
[SPEAKER_02]: And so typically it is used if we basically, if as an assessor, we just overvalue something, which is rare, but it happens, right?

418
00:54:26,949 --> 00:54:36,334
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we have an under construction building and we pick up too much of it in year one, or maybe we just, our model for whatever reason, just overvalues a certain single family home.

419
00:54:37,702 --> 00:54:46,443
[SPEAKER_02]: Overlay is statutorily allowed to create an account that council funds every year to have to pay that amount, right?

420
00:54:46,483 --> 00:54:53,245
[SPEAKER_02]: So another thing it pays for is our senior work off because it has to come off the tax bill after January one.

421
00:54:53,825 --> 00:55:07,207
[SPEAKER_02]: It also pays for people who apply for personal exemptions, like low income, elderly and veteran populations who apply after the tax bill is sent out, but before the April one deadline.

422
00:55:07,642 --> 00:55:14,347
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of like a way to unforeseen abatements and personal exemptions to pay for those.

423
00:55:14,888 --> 00:55:31,281
[SPEAKER_02]: So in this case, because if you were to pass it and we didn't expect that, all of the 10,000 or 9,000 applicants who do live here and do occupy their homes would apply and we would have to pay that money out of this account.

424
00:55:32,482 --> 00:55:33,343
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just, yeah.

425
00:55:33,583 --> 00:55:35,885
[SPEAKER_07]: Ted, just I think to clarify the point,

426
00:55:38,354 --> 00:55:43,323
[SPEAKER_07]: If we were planning for the residential exemption, the tax rate that you would have submitted tonight would have been different.

427
00:55:43,944 --> 00:55:44,305
[SPEAKER_13]: Correct.

428
00:55:44,325 --> 00:55:45,267
[SPEAKER_07]: It would have been higher.

429
00:55:45,607 --> 00:55:46,208
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

430
00:55:46,809 --> 00:55:48,973
[SPEAKER_07]: And the issue being if we pass this tax rate,

431
00:55:50,034 --> 00:55:55,018
[SPEAKER_07]: Essentially, let's say 10,000 people apply for 35% exemptions if that's what we pass.

432
00:55:56,018 --> 00:56:01,982
[SPEAKER_07]: We would need to have tens of millions of dollars in the overlay account to pay back those exemptions.

433
00:56:02,002 --> 00:56:09,948
[SPEAKER_07]: But we wouldn't have raised that because the tax rate would be set based on not having that exemption, essentially.

434
00:56:12,230 --> 00:56:19,155
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not that we would have to get out of the overlay account, it's that we would have to have come here to this meeting with an option

435
00:56:19,975 --> 00:56:26,638
[SPEAKER_05]: of a tax rate that would cover that, but is the question that you don't know what that tax rate is because you don't know how many?

436
00:56:26,658 --> 00:56:34,181
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you would have had to open it up at the beginning of the fiscal year so that we could have applications come in so that we could process it and build it into the tax rate.

437
00:56:35,241 --> 00:56:36,542
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't built it into the tax rate.

438
00:56:37,122 --> 00:56:38,803
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you haven't had the applications come in yet?

439
00:56:39,123 --> 00:56:42,124
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we don't have a residential exemption, because we haven't voted to have it.

440
00:56:43,805 --> 00:56:48,567
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just want to understand, you couldn't, for example,

441
00:56:50,083 --> 00:56:56,966
[SPEAKER_05]: yesterday or tonight and we post on the news tomorrow, just saying hypotheticals, you could not come up with that number.

442
00:56:56,986 --> 00:56:58,247
[SPEAKER_02]: The number of what?

443
00:56:58,807 --> 00:57:03,350
[SPEAKER_05]: You could not come up with the appropriate tax rate for us to have a residential exemption.

444
00:57:04,430 --> 00:57:10,673
[SPEAKER_02]: It would depend on how many residential exemptions are built into the tax recap we submit to the state.

445
00:57:10,853 --> 00:57:13,094
[SPEAKER_02]: So how many have I received at that point?

446
00:57:14,875 --> 00:57:16,476
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't allow us to estimate.

447
00:57:17,377 --> 00:57:17,477
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

448
00:57:19,332 --> 00:57:28,096
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you would open up applications in June, we receive 9,000, you could say we expect this, that would, and then, or?

449
00:57:28,577 --> 00:57:32,899
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we would just, we have 9,000 as of right now, and that's what we're building with the tax rate.

450
00:57:33,079 --> 00:57:33,359
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

451
00:57:33,479 --> 00:57:34,880
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

452
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:36,040
[SPEAKER_05]: So how does that happen?

453
00:57:36,580 --> 00:57:40,562
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, let's say we wanna pass this as soon as we can.

454
00:57:42,623 --> 00:57:44,104
[SPEAKER_05]: When do you open up those?

455
00:57:44,124 --> 00:57:47,866
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, since the city hasn't passed it yet, would the city have to then pass it

456
00:57:49,164 --> 00:57:50,444
[SPEAKER_05]: This is what you're saying, I think.

457
00:57:50,864 --> 00:58:07,007
[SPEAKER_05]: The city would have to pass it in maybe June so that you can receive enough applications so that when it comes to tonight's vote in late November, you can set the rate, which you can't set because we don't have any applications.

458
00:58:07,047 --> 00:58:07,367
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct.

459
00:58:09,948 --> 00:58:12,588
[SPEAKER_07]: And so just again, to clarify, there'd be a separate vote.

460
00:58:13,988 --> 00:58:16,209
[SPEAKER_07]: This would not be the vote to establish the exemption?

461
00:58:16,229 --> 00:58:16,809
[SPEAKER_07]: This would be?

462
00:58:19,619 --> 00:58:20,520
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't quote me on this one.

463
00:58:20,540 --> 00:58:27,783
[SPEAKER_02]: If we had a city council, I would, or councilor, if we had, yeah, if we had a city attorney, I could ask them on the logistics.

464
00:58:27,843 --> 00:58:34,767
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe you can adopt it when you choose in the fiscal year, if you wanted to take it up.

465
00:58:35,828 --> 00:58:39,910
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you could say tonight, we want to do it fiscal year 26.

466
00:58:40,110 --> 00:58:40,931
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know about that.

467
00:58:41,091 --> 00:58:44,693
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd have to look into the legalities of it, but it is part of Astro law.

468
00:58:46,283 --> 00:59:00,306
[SPEAKER_02]: fairly certain you can signal that you are going to adopt it and then either adopt it in June or May prior to the fiscal year or signal that you're allowing applications in anticipation of adopting it.

469
00:59:00,746 --> 00:59:01,586
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks, Councilor Calderon.

470
00:59:01,606 --> 00:59:05,807
[SPEAKER_05]: I would like to make a motion that we ask KP Law exactly how we do that.

471
00:59:13,528 --> 00:59:15,429
[SPEAKER_02]: And Jared has some figures for you just on those.

472
00:59:17,079 --> 00:59:18,200
[SPEAKER_07]: Go ahead, Jared.

473
00:59:19,481 --> 00:59:27,446
[SPEAKER_13]: So you were asking the percentage of the residential that's occupied stripped out vacant lands and stripped out commercial residential.

474
00:59:28,507 --> 00:59:32,750
[SPEAKER_13]: So of the 7864, we just divided that by this total of 16,025.

475
00:59:33,030 --> 00:59:34,391
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's 49.01% is the single family.

476
00:59:35,092 --> 00:59:35,232
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

477
00:59:45,067 --> 00:59:51,468
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you happen to have the other numbers for like two or three families or over five or anything like that?

478
00:59:51,988 --> 01:00:01,570
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, so like Ted indicated, the 104s that were up on the board, I can do the math, the only math I did quickly downstairs with the percentage of the single family, but give me two minutes.

479
01:00:01,590 --> 01:00:02,291
[SPEAKER_13]: It's okay.

480
01:00:02,311 --> 01:00:06,111
[SPEAKER_05]: We're apparently not gonna vote on it tonight anyway, so we can get another time.

481
01:00:06,291 --> 01:00:08,392
[SPEAKER_07]: The condo is 23.

482
01:00:08,432 --> 01:00:09,852
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just putting this in the calculator.

483
01:00:09,872 --> 01:00:10,452
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

484
01:00:10,952 --> 01:00:12,813
[SPEAKER_07]: The two family 104s are

485
01:00:18,201 --> 01:00:23,283
[SPEAKER_07]: 24%.

486
01:00:21,002 --> 01:00:23,283
[SPEAKER_07]: The three-family 105s are 3%, 2.9%.

487
01:00:23,343 --> 01:00:27,145
[SPEAKER_07]: In the denominator, you're using 16.025.

488
01:00:27,185 --> 01:00:27,345
[SPEAKER_07]: 16.025, yeah.

489
01:00:27,385 --> 01:00:28,165
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be accurate.

490
01:00:28,525 --> 01:00:28,925
[SPEAKER_13]: And then the

491
01:00:38,169 --> 01:00:43,970
[SPEAKER_07]: number of parcels over that three families, so four and up is only 116, so it's only 0.01.

492
01:00:44,790 --> 01:00:48,471
[SPEAKER_07]: It's 0.007, so what, 0.7?

493
01:00:48,871 --> 01:00:50,632
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's parcels and not units.

494
01:00:51,032 --> 01:00:52,652
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, it's parcels, not units, yeah.

495
01:00:53,032 --> 01:00:54,573
[SPEAKER_05]: So units would be useful.

496
01:00:54,893 --> 01:00:56,573
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think units would be useful.

497
01:00:56,593 --> 01:00:59,574
[SPEAKER_07]: I think even also like valuation, right?

498
01:00:59,674 --> 01:01:04,415
[SPEAKER_07]: It's 116 parcels, but it's probably 20, $30 million of valuation in that 116.

499
01:01:06,078 --> 01:01:10,682
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd have to go back and look at the total valuation and add that up, but yeah, it would be up there.

500
01:01:10,962 --> 01:01:11,803
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I make another motion?

501
01:01:12,243 --> 01:01:12,524
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

502
01:01:12,604 --> 01:01:18,329
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have, let's do this as a B paper and we can combine this.

503
01:01:18,369 --> 01:01:33,082
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have a B paper from Councilor Callahan, 2.1 request legal procedure to adopt residential exemption from KP law.

504
01:01:37,236 --> 01:01:38,497
[SPEAKER_07]: And then your second part of it is.

505
01:01:38,657 --> 01:01:52,288
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for the assessor's office to provide us with the percentages and numbers of the single family, two family, three family, four family, five to nine, 10 to 19, over 20.

506
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:00,042
[SPEAKER_05]: as well as valuations, average valuations, I think, for them.

507
01:02:00,062 --> 01:02:01,502
[SPEAKER_13]: So percentage of valuation by class.

508
01:02:02,023 --> 01:02:02,463
[SPEAKER_05]: That'd be great.

509
01:02:02,903 --> 01:02:03,023
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

510
01:02:03,163 --> 01:02:08,326
[SPEAKER_05]: Or any other information that you think would be helpful for us to make a decision about a residential exemption.

511
01:02:08,486 --> 01:02:09,006
[SPEAKER_05]: Understood.

512
01:02:09,527 --> 01:02:09,807
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

513
01:02:09,847 --> 01:02:16,911
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think that if we could add in the number of units above or number of parcels above and below the break even.

514
01:02:16,931 --> 01:02:18,892
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep.

515
01:02:19,212 --> 01:02:19,792
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, that too.

516
01:02:22,834 --> 01:02:22,934
[SPEAKER_13]: OK.

517
01:02:23,971 --> 01:02:24,331
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

518
01:02:24,351 --> 01:02:29,317
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to go to Councilor Collins and then Councilor Scarpelli, I think.

519
01:02:33,721 --> 01:02:34,522
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, President Bears.

520
01:02:34,562 --> 01:02:35,343
[SPEAKER_04]: Can folks hear me okay?

521
01:02:37,105 --> 01:02:37,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

522
01:02:38,286 --> 01:02:38,506
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

523
01:02:39,027 --> 01:02:39,427
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

524
01:02:40,909 --> 01:02:43,952
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you to the assessor and his team for this presentation.

525
01:02:45,478 --> 01:02:50,421
[SPEAKER_04]: I will say I have a much easier time with this presentation now that it's my third time receiving it than the first couple.

526
01:02:50,481 --> 01:02:57,686
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you, as always, for walking us through these technical and really important concepts.

527
01:02:59,007 --> 01:03:03,589
[SPEAKER_04]: I certainly appreciate the discussion around the residential exemption as I do every year.

528
01:03:03,689 --> 01:03:11,134
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is something that we have a really, I think, nuanced and important conversation every year around this time.

529
01:03:12,074 --> 01:03:16,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we want to consider, you know, this tool is a tool that exists, it's appropriate for some communities.

530
01:03:16,617 --> 01:03:22,259
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it's really important to consider, is it something that would be appropriate for Medford?

531
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:26,121
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it something that would be appropriate for Medford now or in the future?

532
01:03:26,141 --> 01:03:33,845
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that point at which kind of similar to the break-even point that we have to consider that the residential exemption itself would create?

533
01:03:34,386 --> 01:03:37,107
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think for me, you know, based on the data that's been presented,

534
01:03:38,482 --> 01:03:48,189
[SPEAKER_04]: Where I come down is similar to in previous years when we hear about that breakeven point we know that a residential exemption would benefit a lot of people who really deserve it, and we know that it would disadvantage a lot of people that would also really deserve it.

535
01:03:48,830 --> 01:03:53,554
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that we should absolutely continue to gather more information about what exactly this would mean.

536
01:03:54,194 --> 01:03:59,057
[SPEAKER_04]: for our community and as, you know, the character of our parcels evolves gradually each year.

537
01:04:00,477 --> 01:04:02,719
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's so important to get this right.

538
01:04:03,279 --> 01:04:07,841
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, as we know from other parts of this discussion, you know, those little changes make a really big difference.

539
01:04:09,342 --> 01:04:12,164
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I don't have any specific questions on the presentation.

540
01:04:13,304 --> 01:04:16,666
[SPEAKER_04]: But I would just say, you know, kind of on that point of where can we do

541
01:04:17,998 --> 01:04:28,123
[SPEAKER_04]: where can we help legislate for the most benefit and the most help to our residents as we're contemplating the split in the tax limit?

542
01:04:28,183 --> 01:04:43,050
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, for as long as I've been on the council, and I think for longer before that, we have adopted the maximum split rate, which shifts the burden onto commercial, industrial, and personal property, and maximally, as allowed by state law, away from residential properties.

543
01:04:43,791 --> 01:04:44,951
[SPEAKER_04]: And after discussion,

544
01:04:46,392 --> 01:04:47,193
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a fellow councilors.

545
01:04:47,233 --> 01:05:00,664
[SPEAKER_04]: I certainly don't want to rush this discussion along, but I would be happy to make a motion to adopt the split rate of 175% so that we can continue to shift the tax burden maximally away from residential taxpayers.

546
01:05:01,785 --> 01:05:02,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks again, Ted.

547
01:05:04,467 --> 01:05:04,707
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

548
01:05:04,727 --> 01:05:06,108
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna go to Councilor Scarpelli.

549
01:05:09,351 --> 01:05:13,194
[SPEAKER_12]: We're seeing things that, unfortunately, your department

550
01:05:14,011 --> 01:05:18,172
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been tasked to do things way too late, right?

551
01:05:19,052 --> 01:05:29,175
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm glad to see my fellow colleagues are now realizing after they supported the override that how the vulnerable community is really gonna hurt now.

552
01:05:29,495 --> 01:05:29,895
[SPEAKER_12]: They're hurting.

553
01:05:30,576 --> 01:05:43,299
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's something that I welcome the conversation starting earlier now to look at that homeowner exemption because of that demographic that I was screaming about

554
01:05:44,065 --> 01:05:51,727
[SPEAKER_12]: that bought their homes for $50,000, but now they're worth a million, and they're being priced out with additional override taxes.

555
01:05:52,147 --> 01:05:58,649
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm glad to hear that we're at least understanding it now, and that there's pain.

556
01:05:59,170 --> 01:06:01,970
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think that's going to be something that we should do.

557
01:06:01,990 --> 01:06:06,532
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if you'll be here in June to do that with us, but we really need to look at that.

558
01:06:06,592 --> 01:06:07,032
[SPEAKER_12]: But again,

559
01:06:08,197 --> 01:06:15,223
[SPEAKER_12]: We also have to be alarmed, as some residents have said when we talked about this issue, is that the burden falls on who?

560
01:06:15,864 --> 01:06:19,667
[SPEAKER_12]: It falls on the homeowners that have rental properties.

561
01:06:20,225 --> 01:06:24,108
[SPEAKER_12]: Those are the ones that are going to pick up the burden if the exemption comes into play.

562
01:06:24,649 --> 01:06:29,793
[SPEAKER_12]: So the fear now is the talk that was started last year was rent control.

563
01:06:30,553 --> 01:06:38,680
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think that this is something that this community should really pay close attention to because there's a machine that's going.

564
01:06:40,387 --> 01:07:00,583
[SPEAKER_12]: there's a system in place and people have to see what's happening with our council in the direction they've been moving to, whether it was, you know, transfer tax, whether it's fees for a registry, whether it's an override, whether it's a homeowner exemption now and looking at rent control possibly in the future.

565
01:07:00,983 --> 01:07:06,747
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a lot that this city is gonna be moving to if people don't realize and get more involved.

566
01:07:08,055 --> 01:07:25,602
[SPEAKER_12]: This administration, like my colleague said has done a, at least from what I gather, she was saying she was saying that they've done a terrible job, really preparing this community, and what avenues we can take to give us the best choices possible, both in a, a

567
01:07:27,896 --> 01:07:35,958
[SPEAKER_12]: a speedy override discussion without the input and without the proper timing during the budget season.

568
01:07:36,438 --> 01:07:45,440
[SPEAKER_12]: And now here we go with the assessment and the levy that we have to look at, look at homeowner exemption as we move forward.

569
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:49,321
[SPEAKER_12]: So again, I appreciate what my colleagues have said.

570
01:07:49,361 --> 01:07:56,423
[SPEAKER_12]: It's something that we can't do anything today, but it's something that we, I think, have to look at early.

571
01:07:58,211 --> 01:08:11,460
[SPEAKER_12]: earlier in the season now, when we get to the budget season to make sure we have enough money in the overlay to make sure that if we have that 49.9% of homeowners that apply for the exemption, that we can cover that cost.

572
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:13,121
[SPEAKER_12]: So again, thank you for everything.

573
01:08:14,682 --> 01:08:15,003
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

574
01:08:24,710 --> 01:08:27,791
[SPEAKER_08]: Look, we could re-litigate an election that's already happened.

575
01:08:28,812 --> 01:08:31,293
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no need for that right now.

576
01:08:31,693 --> 01:08:35,275
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't want this to, there are important policy questions that we have to vote on.

577
01:08:35,295 --> 01:08:38,576
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want this to get sidetracked.

578
01:08:40,117 --> 01:08:52,182
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's important for us to acknowledge that much of the choices that we make as a community about fiscal policy, about budgets, about tax rates, about burdens are

579
01:08:54,051 --> 01:08:56,842
[SPEAKER_08]: larger normative questions about what we want the city to look like.

580
01:09:00,559 --> 01:09:06,800
[SPEAKER_08]: what this council has done is ask the public to vote on those questions for the first time in a very long time.

581
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:09,861
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's all I'll say about the politics of the situation.

582
01:09:10,701 --> 01:09:21,443
[SPEAKER_08]: When it comes to questions like the residential tax exemption, I know this is something that you and your predecessors have come to the council before and talked about.

583
01:09:21,463 --> 01:09:28,304
[SPEAKER_08]: And while not all the councilors present may have been there for those meetings, I think a lot of the points that you brought up today

584
01:09:29,944 --> 01:09:32,687
[SPEAKER_08]: have been asked and answered at those meetings as well.

585
01:09:34,328 --> 01:09:45,218
[SPEAKER_08]: In my first council term, I know, I believe a resolution was introduced onto the floor to hold a meeting talking about the residential tax exemption.

586
01:09:46,359 --> 01:09:50,183
[SPEAKER_08]: While I think we can litigate whether

587
01:09:51,934 --> 01:09:55,117
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, the administration should be the one coming to us or we should be going to the administration.

588
01:09:55,137 --> 01:10:01,583
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that that's an equally important channel for the council to be the one stepping up and asking the questions.

589
01:10:01,663 --> 01:10:08,869
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know from this councillor and from a number of councillors who have already served on this council, we've had those questions and asked an answer before.

590
01:10:09,910 --> 01:10:12,132
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think I just want to take this moment and

591
01:10:13,283 --> 01:10:26,396
[SPEAKER_08]: advise my fellow counselors that, you know, that's a possibility that we have, is to hold a meeting earlier in the year, as we've done before, to talk about these questions.

592
01:10:27,838 --> 01:10:34,144
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't think this is a question of, are we ready, are we not ready?

593
01:10:35,623 --> 01:10:48,379
[SPEAKER_08]: I think for a lot of the counselors here we've talked for a very long time about how all these moving pieces fit together and we've presented our vision, we understand that this is a policy question, we understand that this is a normative question.

594
01:10:50,998 --> 01:10:56,240
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's frankly a little exhausting to have this meeting be sidetracked.

595
01:10:56,260 --> 01:11:00,902
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would ask that we focus on the important questions at hand.

596
01:11:01,783 --> 01:11:06,965
[SPEAKER_08]: And I would second Councilor Collins' motion for the 175% shift.

597
01:11:08,166 --> 01:11:08,506
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

598
01:11:08,526 --> 01:11:09,426
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Callahan.

599
01:11:20,657 --> 01:11:21,778
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

600
01:11:22,058 --> 01:11:27,902
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope it is not considered off topic to talk about the residential exemption that is on the agenda.

601
01:11:29,884 --> 01:11:37,470
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm just curious, do we have good information on the multifamily housing and how many are owner-occupied?

602
01:11:37,490 --> 01:11:40,492
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that something that you could provide to us?

603
01:11:44,695 --> 01:11:45,536
[SPEAKER_02]: Generally,

604
01:11:46,595 --> 01:11:48,916
[SPEAKER_02]: we don't code owner-occupants.

605
01:11:49,216 --> 01:11:49,977
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't know, right?

606
01:11:50,057 --> 01:11:54,478
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, we could... I'm just trying to think.

607
01:11:54,838 --> 01:11:56,239
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd have to probably do a canvas of those.

608
01:11:56,359 --> 01:11:56,599
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

609
01:11:56,799 --> 01:11:57,179
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

610
01:11:58,980 --> 01:12:00,681
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's something you can provide, that'd be great.

611
01:12:01,321 --> 01:12:03,242
[SPEAKER_05]: If you don't know, then yeah, I totally get it.

612
01:12:03,842 --> 01:12:04,102
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fine.

613
01:12:04,122 --> 01:12:04,822
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just curious.

614
01:12:05,383 --> 01:12:05,683
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.

615
01:12:07,724 --> 01:12:08,084
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

616
01:12:08,164 --> 01:12:11,125
[SPEAKER_07]: Any further discussion on either the B paper or the main paper?

617
01:12:16,058 --> 01:12:18,299
[SPEAKER_07]: Seeing none, we'll go to public participation.

618
01:12:18,319 --> 01:12:21,539
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there anyone who would like to speak in person or on Zoom?

619
01:12:21,559 --> 01:12:24,360
[SPEAKER_07]: Please come to the podium in person or raise your hand on Zoom.

620
01:12:32,862 --> 01:12:34,823
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

621
01:12:36,303 --> 01:12:38,223
[SPEAKER_07]: So name and address for the record, please.

622
01:12:38,984 --> 01:12:40,704
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can talk on any of the items.

623
01:12:41,644 --> 01:12:44,045
[SPEAKER_00]: Gaston Fury, 61 Stigner Road, Wichita, Lansing.

624
01:12:45,993 --> 01:12:51,619
[SPEAKER_00]: I just took a few notes based on the discussion that I just heard.

625
01:12:52,980 --> 01:13:05,952
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first one is that I would, I mean, I really hope that before anyone decides to implement the residential exemption, there's a clear analysis about how much it's going to cost the taxpayer

626
01:13:06,553 --> 01:13:08,394
[SPEAKER_00]: to implement this residential exemption.

627
01:13:08,514 --> 01:13:15,518
[SPEAKER_00]: We cannot implement anything unless we know specifically how much money we're going to have to put into the assessor's office in order to implement this.

628
01:13:16,678 --> 01:13:16,979
[SPEAKER_00]: Point two.

629
01:13:18,341 --> 01:13:30,386
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would greatly appreciate to have the slides that I just saw, or I tried to see because I couldn't see them that well, before the meeting and definitely after the meeting as well.

630
01:13:30,566 --> 01:13:37,769
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the general public to be able to produce the numbers and even run some analysis if they so desire.

631
01:13:38,970 --> 01:13:43,832
[SPEAKER_00]: And so please, if we could have the slides available for the public.

632
01:13:45,053 --> 01:13:47,355
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, and I did upload it when I got it.

633
01:13:47,655 --> 01:13:49,276
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, thanks so much Mr. President.

634
01:13:49,296 --> 01:13:50,257
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's on the council portal.

635
01:13:50,277 --> 01:13:50,677
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much.

636
01:13:51,678 --> 01:14:08,953
[SPEAKER_00]: And point number three is that I was a little bit surprised when I saw, when I heard Councilor Callaghan kind of trying to, you know, talk about a vote tonight about either implementing or not implementing the residential exemption.

637
01:14:09,984 --> 01:14:24,703
[SPEAKER_00]: I really hope that whatever we decide to change something or not there's extensive open public participation and not like here that there's only two residents in this room and I'm not sure how many in zoom.

638
01:14:25,723 --> 01:14:43,176
[SPEAKER_00]: I really would hope that we do not have a vote on this without having had multiple sessions open to the public with a lot of advertising, hearing from homeowners, renters, business owners, and everyone in the Medford community.

639
01:14:43,957 --> 01:14:45,138
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be a big change.

640
01:14:45,948 --> 01:14:52,831
[SPEAKER_00]: independently of whether one is in favor or not in favor of it, there has to be extensive multiple open public participation sessions.

641
01:14:53,252 --> 01:14:55,093
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope that we have those in the future.

642
01:14:55,233 --> 01:14:55,733
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.

643
01:14:55,753 --> 01:14:57,254
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate the opportunity to speak.

644
01:14:57,614 --> 01:14:58,014
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

645
01:15:00,615 --> 01:15:04,577
[SPEAKER_07]: So first, we'll take the B paper by Councilor Callahan to request.

646
01:15:06,338 --> 01:15:09,520
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll go to Andy when we take, we're going to have a bunch of motions here.

647
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:09,720
[SPEAKER_07]: So

648
01:15:11,246 --> 01:15:18,533
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we're gonna have five votes so, and you can talk on like the third one, wherever we end up.

649
01:15:19,094 --> 01:15:27,962
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a B paper from Councilor Callahan to request the legal procedure to adopt residential exemption from KP law and also to request from the assessor's office.

650
01:15:29,063 --> 01:15:32,406
[SPEAKER_07]: The percentage of units and valuation across the residential classes.

651
01:15:33,923 --> 01:15:42,749
[SPEAKER_07]: And also I think as amended, if you would just include the number of residential units or parcels above and below the breakeven point for the exemption.

652
01:15:44,250 --> 01:15:52,476
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have that motion from Councilor Callahan, seconded by seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

653
01:15:55,458 --> 01:15:57,579
[SPEAKER_07]: On the B paper, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

654
01:15:59,620 --> 01:16:00,281
[SPEAKER_09]: On the B paper.

655
01:16:01,462 --> 01:16:02,022
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Callahan.

656
01:16:03,220 --> 01:16:04,082
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice President Collins.

657
01:16:04,602 --> 01:16:04,823
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

658
01:16:06,506 --> 01:16:07,367
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Lazzaro.

659
01:16:09,772 --> 01:16:10,353
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Leming.

660
01:16:11,194 --> 01:16:11,455
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

661
01:16:13,819 --> 01:16:14,520
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scarpelli.

662
01:16:14,801 --> 01:16:15,001
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

663
01:16:16,083 --> 01:16:16,624
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Tseng.

664
01:16:18,902 --> 01:16:19,502
[SPEAKER_09]: President Bears?

665
01:16:20,223 --> 01:16:20,523
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

666
01:16:21,363 --> 01:16:22,684
[SPEAKER_07]: Six in the affirmative, one in the negative.

667
01:16:22,904 --> 01:16:24,265
[SPEAKER_07]: The B paper is adopted.

668
01:16:25,185 --> 01:16:26,946
[SPEAKER_07]: We have four votes ahead of us.

669
01:16:27,006 --> 01:16:35,511
[SPEAKER_07]: First, we had the motion from Councilor Collins to adopt the 175% shift, which I think would be a motion to adopt a minimum residential factor of 0.9072.

670
01:16:35,931 --> 01:16:38,192
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that correct?

671
01:16:47,196 --> 01:16:48,037
[SPEAKER_07]: Maximum or minimum?

672
01:16:56,512 --> 01:16:56,832
[SPEAKER_07]: Got it.

673
01:16:57,252 --> 01:17:01,718
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to drop the lowest possible residential factor for fiscal 25.

674
01:17:01,898 --> 01:17:03,440
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

675
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:09,787
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion of Councilor Collins to adopt the lowest possible residential factor for fiscal 25 seconded by Councilor Tseng.

676
01:17:10,528 --> 01:17:11,449
[SPEAKER_07]: Any further discussion?

677
01:17:29,317 --> 01:17:29,977
Let me know when you're ready.

678
01:17:35,939 --> 01:17:36,279
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

683
01:17:45,002 --> 01:17:45,862
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Lazzaro.

684
01:17:47,163 --> 01:17:47,703
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Leming.

685
01:17:48,143 --> 01:17:48,363
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

686
01:17:49,653 --> 01:17:50,414
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scarpelli?

687
01:17:50,574 --> 01:17:50,754
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

688
01:17:51,174 --> 01:17:51,795
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Tseng?

689
01:17:51,815 --> 01:17:51,975
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

690
01:17:52,635 --> 01:17:53,336
[SPEAKER_09]: President Bears?

691
01:17:53,376 --> 01:17:53,616
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

692
01:17:53,636 --> 01:17:54,857
[SPEAKER_07]: I have the affirmative, none of the negative.

693
01:17:54,877 --> 01:17:55,817
[SPEAKER_07]: The motion passes.

694
01:17:57,438 --> 01:17:58,179
[SPEAKER_07]: And we'll go next.

695
01:17:58,219 --> 01:18:03,283
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll do the open space discount, even though we don't have to, but we have in the past, so we'll do it for now.

696
01:18:04,423 --> 01:18:06,985
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there a motion to not adopt an open space discount?

697
01:18:07,586 --> 01:18:08,306
[SPEAKER_12]: Motion to not.

698
01:18:08,986 --> 01:18:09,207
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

699
01:18:09,587 --> 01:18:12,129
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion to not adopt an open space discount.

700
01:18:12,689 --> 01:18:14,490
[SPEAKER_07]: So voting yes means we would not adopt.

701
01:18:15,371 --> 01:18:17,272
[SPEAKER_07]: By Councilor Tseng, seconded by?

702
01:18:17,953 --> 01:18:18,233
[SPEAKER_04]: Second.

703
01:18:19,212 --> 01:18:20,953
[SPEAKER_07]: Seconded by Vice President Collins.

704
01:18:21,353 --> 01:18:22,974
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Clerk, when you're ready, please call the roll.

[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Callahan.

706
01:18:31,860 --> 01:18:32,681
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice President Collins.

707
01:18:33,121 --> 01:18:33,361
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

708
01:18:34,662 --> 01:18:35,522
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Lazzaro.

709
01:18:36,723 --> 01:18:37,284
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Leming.

710
01:18:37,724 --> 01:18:38,044
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

711
01:18:39,245 --> 01:18:39,905

[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Tseng.

714
01:18:42,407 --> 01:18:42,487
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

715
01:18:43,027 --> 01:18:43,628
[SPEAKER_09]: President Bears.

716
01:18:43,688 --> 01:18:43,868
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

717
01:18:43,908 --> 01:18:45,909
[SPEAKER_07]: I have the affirmative, none the negative, the motion passes.

718
01:18:45,929 --> 01:18:48,651
[SPEAKER_07]: On the residential exemption, is there a motion?

719
01:18:52,502 --> 01:18:58,845
[SPEAKER_07]: on the motion to not adopt the residential exemption by Councilor Tseng second would be to not adopt.

720
01:18:59,605 --> 01:19:01,426
[SPEAKER_07]: Seconded by Councilor Collins.

721
01:19:02,086 --> 01:19:03,607
[SPEAKER_07]: We will go to public participation.

722
01:19:04,288 --> 01:19:06,589
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Castagnetti name and address for the record, please.

723
01:19:07,869 --> 01:19:16,734
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, personally, I want to compliment Councilor Callahan for asking intelligent and pertinent common sense questions about this.

724
01:19:17,234 --> 01:19:18,034
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate that.

725
01:19:18,475 --> 01:19:19,135
[SPEAKER_06]: You impressed me.

726
01:19:53,294 --> 01:20:11,048
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a filing problem.

727
01:20:18,233 --> 01:20:18,313
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

728
01:20:18,333 --> 01:20:21,316
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for your patience.

729
01:20:29,571 --> 01:20:33,834
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm Andrew Castagnetti, 23 Cushman Street, 02155.

730
01:20:36,136 --> 01:20:38,578
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening, honorable counselors.

731
01:20:39,919 --> 01:20:45,423
[SPEAKER_06]: First, I might start with this newspaper article in the Boston Globe.

732
01:20:45,963 --> 01:20:51,708
[SPEAKER_06]: It was about our meeting on October 29th at the city council.

733
01:20:52,228 --> 01:20:57,192
[SPEAKER_06]: And I will quote the reporter as she quoted me.

734
01:21:00,012 --> 01:21:06,996
[SPEAKER_06]: One resident brought this concern, his concerns, to the city council meeting on Tuesday.

735
01:21:08,337 --> 01:21:11,518
[SPEAKER_06]: This paper is actually on Saturday, November 2nd.

736
01:21:13,259 --> 01:21:19,203
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of taxpayers are having trouble paying bills with all this inflation in the past four years.

737
01:21:20,063 --> 01:21:26,026
[SPEAKER_06]: Andrew Castagnetti said, I have one question for all of you city councilors.

738
01:21:26,907 --> 01:21:28,648
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have any ideas to

739
01:21:32,837 --> 01:21:37,039
[SPEAKER_06]: lower, lower our real estate tax at all.

740
01:21:37,979 --> 01:21:38,900
[SPEAKER_06]: I am listening.

741
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:47,984
[SPEAKER_06]: And the reporter sort of reported that the counselors, you counselors, no one answered.

742
01:21:49,145 --> 01:22:00,890
[SPEAKER_06]: So I expected at least at minimum that one of your counselors or more would bring up chapter 59, section 5C, the owner of real estate,

743
01:22:01,556 --> 01:22:13,546
[SPEAKER_06]: owner-occupied real estate tax exemption, because that's the only one I know about that would apply in Medford, along with 18 other communities that have adopted this.

744
01:22:14,807 --> 01:22:20,932
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I am here again for the 19th time.

745
01:22:22,053 --> 01:22:27,238
[SPEAKER_06]: We're asking for the city to adopt Mass General Law Chapter 59, Section 5C.

746
01:22:29,807 --> 01:22:35,852
[SPEAKER_06]: The owner occupied real estate tax exemption at the full 35% shift.

747
01:22:37,113 --> 01:22:45,360
[SPEAKER_06]: This savings is being done in Chelsea, Everett, Malden, Cambridge, Somerville, and in all of Boston.

748
01:22:46,201 --> 01:22:56,470
[SPEAKER_06]: Senator Kerry gets it at 28 Lewisburg Square if that's his truthful address according to the IRS tax document, if.

749
01:22:58,846 --> 01:23:01,648
[SPEAKER_06]: So why not here in Medford?

750
01:23:02,568 --> 01:23:05,210
[SPEAKER_06]: We also need real estate tax savings.

751
01:23:06,451 --> 01:23:21,220
[SPEAKER_06]: Somerville owner-occupied homeowners saved $4,053 last year with a cap break of, a breakeven cap of $2 million.

752
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:26,703
[SPEAKER_06]: And Malden saved

753
01:23:28,289 --> 01:23:39,178
[SPEAKER_06]: $2,690.04 with a cap break even of at one and a quarter million dollars.

754
01:23:42,241 --> 01:23:43,882
[SPEAKER_06]: These numbers are not fake.

755
01:23:45,704 --> 01:23:50,828
[SPEAKER_06]: These numbers I got from both city hall assessors in person.

756
01:23:52,309 --> 01:23:56,193
[SPEAKER_06]: I will leave with you these assessor

757
01:23:58,650 --> 01:23:59,550
[SPEAKER_06]: City reports.

758
01:24:00,971 --> 01:24:01,551
[SPEAKER_06]: There they are.

759
01:24:03,892 --> 01:24:17,215
[SPEAKER_06]: I will leave you with the reports from the assessors and these reports with you to trust and but verify the numbers.

760
01:24:19,396 --> 01:24:27,178
[SPEAKER_06]: P.S., in the last 10 years, these owner-occupied homeowners in Malden and Somerville saved an average of

761
01:24:29,794 --> 01:24:34,457
[SPEAKER_06]: $2,600 per year in the last 10-year average.

762
01:24:36,559 --> 01:24:49,848
[SPEAKER_06]: My translation means we MedFed owner-occupied homeowners have lost out on a $26,000 savings in the last 10 years on average.

763
01:24:51,469 --> 01:24:55,852
[SPEAKER_06]: And that does not include lost bank and interest.

764
01:24:58,476 --> 01:24:59,036
[SPEAKER_06]: Page two.

765
01:25:02,397 --> 01:25:14,279
[SPEAKER_06]: People say you can't fight city hall, but I had fun trying for 19 years without success on this matter.

766
01:25:15,579 --> 01:25:18,999
[SPEAKER_06]: This is my 19th time trying to help the average homeowner.

767
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:22,060
[SPEAKER_06]: Here comes my 19th nervous breakdown.

768
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:23,240
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm tired.

769
01:25:25,661 --> 01:25:27,621
[SPEAKER_06]: So now I am asking the homeowners

770
01:25:28,604 --> 01:25:37,830
[SPEAKER_06]: in Medford for small donations to hire a real estate tax lawyer and a retired real estate tax assessor.

771
01:25:38,811 --> 01:25:45,955
[SPEAKER_06]: Andrew Castagnetti, 23 Cushing Street, Medford, Massachusetts, 23.

772
01:25:52,620 --> 01:25:57,283
[SPEAKER_06]: Here is the packet of information from Malden and Somerville City Assessors.

773
01:26:02,617 --> 01:26:03,738
[SPEAKER_06]: Somerville started in 1992.

774
01:26:08,121 --> 01:26:13,285
[SPEAKER_06]: Malden started the owner-occupied-exemption in 2008.

775
01:26:14,926 --> 01:26:26,055
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, I repeat, City of Malden saved the owner-occupied-exemption peoples that own the houses, that live in the house $2,690 last year.

776
01:26:33,300 --> 01:27:00,757
[SPEAKER_06]: And Somerville, as I said, started in 1992, and last year they saved, if they qualified, if they truly lived in the home, doesn't matter if it's a one, two, three, four, five, or six family, because it only applies to their unit, including Senator Kerry, if he's telling the truth about his address, and Beacon Hill.

777
01:27:03,874 --> 01:27:04,935
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a lot of cake, man.

778
01:27:07,336 --> 01:27:32,614
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's other communities, as you know, and it all started in Martha's Vineyard, I believe, or Nantucket, or both, this exemption, because the residents, the working class people that were taking care of the lawns and working in the restaurants that lived there, they couldn't really afford, but they didn't want people around with these mansions like ex-president

779
01:27:33,243 --> 01:27:41,625
[SPEAKER_06]: Obama, who don't live there, they're not owner-occupied, and they get tired.

780
01:27:41,925 --> 01:27:46,807
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is how this law passed, according to what I believe is truth.

781
01:27:48,067 --> 01:27:49,268
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think I've said enough.

782
01:27:49,368 --> 01:27:52,448
[SPEAKER_06]: If you have any comments or questions, I really would appreciate it.

783
01:27:55,389 --> 01:27:58,110
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. Castagnetti, and we'll share those around.

784
01:27:59,971 --> 01:28:01,191
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been a long time coming.

785
01:28:05,973 --> 01:28:08,815
[SPEAKER_07]: Any further discussion by members of the public or Councilor Lazzaro?

786
01:28:12,857 --> 01:28:15,218
[SPEAKER_01]: If I can just briefly give you a moment of context.

787
01:28:15,378 --> 01:28:22,702
[SPEAKER_01]: When I lived in Somerville, I rented and it was getting very expensive to rent.

788
01:28:22,922 --> 01:28:24,683
[SPEAKER_01]: My husband worked for a tech company.

789
01:28:24,743 --> 01:28:32,027
[SPEAKER_01]: We sold stock to pay the down payment on a condo in Somerville because there was a residential exemption.

790
01:28:32,627 --> 01:28:34,288
[SPEAKER_01]: When we were paying our mortgage, we paid less.

791
01:28:35,253 --> 01:28:43,677
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we were homeowners, because we had stock to sell, because we had enough money to buy property, we were able to pay less.

792
01:28:44,638 --> 01:28:51,121
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes residential exemption is what amounts to a handout to people with enough money to buy property.

793
01:28:53,482 --> 01:28:56,643
[SPEAKER_01]: To put that into perspective, sometimes that's what it is.

794
01:28:58,564 --> 01:29:00,725
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it was for me when I lived in Somerville.

795
01:29:04,119 --> 01:29:11,005
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case, I think in Medford, the break even does not make sense at this point today.

796
01:29:11,025 --> 01:29:19,211
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel that our conversation about it is losing some of the context.

797
01:29:22,514 --> 01:29:26,177
[SPEAKER_01]: When our residents voted for the override,

798
01:29:26,886 --> 01:29:30,007
[SPEAKER_01]: They were not voting to then turn around and exempt themselves.

799
01:29:30,707 --> 01:29:35,969
[SPEAKER_01]: They voted to increase the property tax rate as they expected it to be.

800
01:29:37,570 --> 01:29:41,592
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we're voting to enact tonight.

801
01:29:42,592 --> 01:29:42,892
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

802
01:29:43,392 --> 01:29:43,792
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

803
01:29:43,812 --> 01:29:44,733
[SPEAKER_06]: If I may rebut.

804
01:29:44,853 --> 01:29:47,114
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to really quickly, Andy, I saw Mr. Costigan.

805
01:29:49,711 --> 01:29:52,416
[SPEAKER_07]: You got to take over the microphone.

806
01:29:52,456 --> 01:29:53,838
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Castagnetti brought up a good point.

807
01:29:54,058 --> 01:29:57,443
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be adopted under Chapter 59, Section 5C.

808
01:29:58,305 --> 01:30:03,232
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a language that the mayor and the council have to approve, but that would be the adoptive language.

809
01:30:03,773 --> 01:30:04,013
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

810
01:30:04,870 --> 01:30:05,370
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

811
01:30:06,090 --> 01:30:08,091
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Cassidy, I want to go to Mr. Fiore first.

812
01:30:08,451 --> 01:30:09,451
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to rebut her.

813
01:30:09,511 --> 01:30:09,651
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

814
01:30:09,731 --> 01:30:11,432
[SPEAKER_06]: If I may, through the chair.

815
01:30:11,452 --> 01:30:13,092
[SPEAKER_07]: You can make a comment to the chair, but you can't.

816
01:30:13,112 --> 01:30:14,072
[SPEAKER_07]: Through the chair, I say.

817
01:30:14,112 --> 01:30:14,332
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

818
01:30:14,352 --> 01:30:15,433
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not a debate.

819
01:30:15,513 --> 01:30:16,193
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not a rebuttal.

820
01:30:16,253 --> 01:30:16,953
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a comment.

821
01:30:17,253 --> 01:30:17,393
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

822
01:30:17,413 --> 01:30:17,613
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

823
01:30:17,913 --> 01:30:18,693
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to keep it short.

824
01:30:18,713 --> 01:30:34,137
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you imagine that the state senators had a hot, for the first time ever, to help the owner occupied to get a break on the real estate tax?

825
01:30:36,312 --> 01:30:39,194
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm shocked that they did this back in the 90s, I believe.

826
01:30:39,874 --> 01:30:40,655
[SPEAKER_06]: It's amazing.

827
01:30:41,075 --> 01:30:51,342
[SPEAKER_06]: So besides, the owner-occupied homeowners, they've carried the financial load for more than 100 years.

828
01:30:55,545 --> 01:30:56,525
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all I want to say.

829
01:30:57,826 --> 01:30:58,146
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

830
01:30:58,186 --> 01:30:59,067
[SPEAKER_07]: Go to Mr. Fiore.

831
01:30:59,087 --> 01:31:00,708
[SPEAKER_07]: Name and address for the record, please.

832
01:31:02,605 --> 01:31:03,786
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Mr. President.

833
01:31:03,846 --> 01:31:07,749
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually had a question for the assessor.

834
01:31:08,149 --> 01:31:11,392
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had a question related to the breakeven threshold.

835
01:31:11,932 --> 01:31:18,637
[SPEAKER_00]: So Mr. Castagnetti mentioned that in Malden, it's $1.25 million.

836
01:31:18,897 --> 01:31:23,561
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I recall from the assessor here, he competed $980,000.

837
01:31:23,661 --> 01:31:24,241
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to

838
01:31:29,645 --> 01:31:51,546
[SPEAKER_00]: understand, either in this meeting publicly for people that are watching this, or in a future meeting, or I can do the research myself, I just didn't have the time right now, why, so a summary will I understand, because my understanding is that residential properties, they are more expensive on average than here, but Malden, I thought it was around the same as in Medford, maybe I'm wrong, I haven't looked at the data recently,

839
01:31:51,906 --> 01:31:59,370
[SPEAKER_00]: So how is the break-even threshold computed and why is Malden's considerably higher than ours?

840
01:32:00,271 --> 01:32:06,454
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you, Mr. President, had a question that you said that a couple of years ago, ours was even much lower than 980,000.

841
01:32:07,074 --> 01:32:15,359
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would like to understand well, how is that break-even threshold computed and how is it going to evolve in the future and based on what?

842
01:32:17,640 --> 01:32:21,741
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if the assistant assessor, if you want to speak to it or Ted's going to come back.

843
01:32:23,161 --> 01:32:25,902
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like he's might be coming back right now.

844
01:32:27,762 --> 01:32:29,002
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you want to go for it, Jared.

845
01:32:30,923 --> 01:32:33,403
[SPEAKER_13]: What I would say to that is it's a little more complicated.

846
01:32:33,883 --> 01:32:43,065
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a, we, we have a formula in Excel where we have to assume, and I know he touched on it when he gets back, where we assume the percentage that,

847
01:32:44,380 --> 01:32:47,983
[SPEAKER_13]: who will get the residential, will actually apply for it and get the residential exemption.

848
01:32:48,444 --> 01:32:53,328
[SPEAKER_13]: That assumption plays into the break-even point.

849
01:32:53,409 --> 01:32:55,631
[SPEAKER_13]: So is it 70%, is it 80%, is it 65?

850
01:32:55,951 --> 01:32:59,554
[SPEAKER_13]: And that really will change the break-even point in the calculations.

851
01:33:00,475 --> 01:33:09,664
[SPEAKER_13]: So we could put a spreadsheet together and have that as a toggle to show how that would impact the break point, but I couldn't do the math right now for you.

852
01:33:11,604 --> 01:33:13,808
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that would be helpful for future discussions.

853
01:33:15,752 --> 01:33:17,937
[SPEAKER_07]: And just to add on to the context of your point,

854
01:33:18,760 --> 01:33:22,943
[SPEAKER_07]: The issue is also that you're making an assumption of like how many people are going to take it.

855
01:33:22,983 --> 01:33:29,127
[SPEAKER_07]: And the point is the break even point has to be set based on that assumption to keep the levy even.

856
01:33:29,427 --> 01:33:29,607
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

857
01:33:29,627 --> 01:33:39,613
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're setting a new tax rate to raise the same amount of money, but you're basing that on the assumption of how what percentage of residential classes will not change.

858
01:33:39,653 --> 01:33:40,074
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

859
01:33:40,374 --> 01:33:40,554
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

860
01:33:41,334 --> 01:33:42,335
[SPEAKER_13]: How much will get pushed.

861
01:33:42,682 --> 01:33:57,930
[SPEAKER_07]: And under this system, you may, let's say you have a, and this is just, I wanna clarify this too, like say you're in a three-family unit, one of the units is owner-occupied, the other two are not, would that whole structure qualify for an owner occupancy?

862
01:33:58,531 --> 01:34:09,937
[SPEAKER_07]: So you basically would have people, even if they, let's say that three-family is worth 1.2 million, it's over the break-even point, they would have to apply for the owner-occupied exemption

863
01:34:11,069 --> 01:34:14,451
[SPEAKER_07]: their taxes are still gonna go up even though they'll qualify for the exemption essentially, right?

864
01:34:14,871 --> 01:34:18,713
[SPEAKER_07]: But it'll just go up less than if they didn't get the exemption at all.

865
01:34:19,453 --> 01:34:23,635
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm not saying that to make, I mean, it's a specific case.

866
01:34:25,716 --> 01:34:27,017
[SPEAKER_07]: Adam has it, yeah.

867
01:34:27,137 --> 01:34:27,897
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, thank you.

868
01:34:27,937 --> 01:34:29,158
[SPEAKER_07]: Does that answer your question, Gaston?

869
01:34:33,100 --> 01:34:36,882
[SPEAKER_13]: The percentage of people that would actually get the residential exemption.

870
01:34:39,025 --> 01:34:42,168
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's different across the different property classes too, right?

871
01:34:42,268 --> 01:34:44,469
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you mostly just assuming single family and condo?

872
01:34:45,030 --> 01:34:54,338
[SPEAKER_13]: So just assuming out of the single families, the condos, the two families, the three families, and then the apartments, most likely would not get it.

873
01:34:54,378 --> 01:34:58,941
[SPEAKER_13]: That was the 118 of the number, that number.

874
01:34:59,362 --> 01:35:01,603
[SPEAKER_13]: And just to, while I'm up here,

875
01:35:03,314 --> 01:35:04,155
[SPEAKER_13]: make the record correct.

876
01:35:04,215 --> 01:35:05,336
[SPEAKER_13]: The denominator is 16.143.

877
01:35:05,916 --> 01:35:06,957
[SPEAKER_13]: I did pull out the apartment.

878
01:35:06,997 --> 01:35:09,619
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's 48.65 for the record.

879
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:10,940
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

880
01:35:11,421 --> 01:35:11,701
[SPEAKER_07]: Got it.

881
01:35:11,721 --> 01:35:12,121
