Alton Chambers at Medford City Hall, 85 George P. Hassett Drive, Medford, Massachusetts, and via Zoom on Tuesday, November 26, 2024, at 7 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1062.911s">A</a>  link to this hearing will be posted no later than Friday, November 22, 2024. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1067.214s">The</a>  purpose of this hearing is to hear the Board of Assessors on the following items for the purpose of allocation of the FY 2025 property tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1074.807s">One,</a>  to determine the residential factor for FY25. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1078.029s">Two,</a>  selecting an open space discount. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1080.491s">Three,</a>  selecting a residential exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1082.493s">Four,</a>  selecting a small commercial exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1084.955s">Call</a>  781-393-2501 for any aids and accommodations. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1089.538s">Order</a>  of the Redford City Council, Adam Hurtubise, City Clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1092.58s">And</a>  I will turn it over to our assessor, Mr. Costigan.</p>

    <p>[Costigan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1098.024s">Thank</a>  you, appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1101.539s">And</a>  thank you to Council for meeting this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1104.862s">I</a>  know it's a busy week but this really does give the <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1109.602s">the</a>  department and the treasurer of the city enough time to get this tax rate approved by the DOR. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1115.183s">Any</a>  questions they have back to us that we have a few days to answer them and get the tax rate, the tax bills out on time before the first of the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1124.226s">So</a>  I really, really appreciate you meeting today and not pushing it forward a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1129.427s">So</a>  the purpose of this hearing is to adopt the city's tax policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1135.569s">Whoops,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1137.58s">by</a>  allocating their classifying the tax levy amongst the commercial and the residential class. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1143.824s">So</a>  typically in the past in Medford, we have shifted that tax burden from the residential class to the commercial class at the maximum allowable shift. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1157.051s">Great,</a>  all the PowerPoint perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1160.093s">So</a>  on the third page, <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1168.911s">And</a>  as mentioning in prior years, we've gone to that 175% shift of the levy. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1175.653s">And</a>  then we'll also vote, council will vote on the residential exemption as well as the small commercial exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1183.175s">Just</a>  to recap this fiscal year on the next slide, the previous one, sorry, or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1192.793s">Didn't</a>  make it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1193.273s">There's</a>  a hidden one. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1194.754s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1195.014s">There's</a>  a hidden one. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1196.454s">It's</a>  just the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1197.374s">So</a>  basically reminding council that, yep, that's it right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1200.375s">So</a>  just reminding council of our $211 million in the budget, 153.5 of that comes from property taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1203.696s">So</a>  it's about 72% of all revenues in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1217.281s">How</a>  we arrive at assessments is based on fair cash value. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1222.123s">We</a>  look at calendar year 2023 sales to determine our fiscal year 25 fair cash values, all of our valuations of commercial, industrial, and residential properties. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1235.446s">We</a>  are required by Mass General Law to be between 90 and 110% in the assessment to sales ratio. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1242.41s">And</a>  on the next slide, I'll show you those ratios, but we were approved by the Massachusetts DOR in October of these values. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1248.979s">I</a>  know it's a little hard to see, but this just kind of proves out the point in the left column. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1253.305s">We</a>  have just over 7,800 single families. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1257.492s">single</a>  family homes in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1259.713s">We</a>  have 255 sales in calendar year 23, 195 of which were arm's length. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1266.156s">So</a>  that's what we use for our analysis. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1268.116s">Arms</a>  length transactions where a motivated buyer and a motivated seller meet at a price point. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1274.847s">On</a>  those, we were at a 97% assessment to sale ratio. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1278.769s">So</a>  often, council may ask, well, why is the valuation on their tax assessment lower than what they actually paid? <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1286.292s">First</a>  of all, it's a year back. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1288.193s">So</a>  we're calendar year 23. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1289.333s">And</a>  second of all, we are at that 90, the average value is gonna be the 97% assessment sale ratio. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1297.856s">Let's</a>  go on the next page. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1299.057s">Just</a>  wanna go through our assessment review. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1302.038s">Single</a>  families increased <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1304.429s">about</a>  four and a half percent this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1307.351s">Condominiums</a>  were up five and a half. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1310.554s">Two</a>  families and three families, about seven, as well as commercial properties. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1315.077s">Apartments</a>  were only up one. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1316.699s">That's</a>  probably due to an interest rate environment that's changing right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1320.982s">Industrials</a>  were up about five percent and personal property was down a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1326.826s">On</a>  to the next slide, just looking at our surrounding communities and average assessed values, you can see where Medford fits in. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1334.689s">If</a>  you just look at the single family and condos, sort of in between Somerville and Everett, and you can see the other surrounding communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1345.274s">On</a>  the next slide, just looking again at that fiscal year change, you can see how we compare and change to the other communities and what they're seeing in their sales markets. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1359.448s">Part</a>  of what we do in addition to valuing is valuing new growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1364.053s">And</a>  so the two gentlemen sitting behind me, Jared Yagen and Jim O'Brien do a heck of a job for the city in getting $2.5 million in new growth that adds to our levy. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1376.408s">It</a>  is a part of our tax base. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1379.459s">It's</a>  one of the only ways that we can increase that revenue because of Prop 2.5, it's kind of limited at $2.5 million is on top of that Prop 2.5. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1389.228s">It</a>  was split roughly 1.5 million in commercial growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1395.513s">I'm</a>  sorry, 1.5 in residential growth and 1 million in commercial growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1399.456s">And</a>  it shows in the next slide how we kind of derive that using the prior tax rate and the new growth valuations. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1409.113s">On</a>  the following slide, we did a pretty good job this year, as I mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1413.475s">We</a>  were almost in line with last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1417.376s">But</a>  again, with permits being a little down this year, I would say we did a pretty good job at staying almost consistent on a year-on-year basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1426.42s">So</a>  just next slide there. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1430.622s">You</a>  can see how it stacks up on previous years. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1435.755s">And</a>  the next slide, just looking at our fiscal year 2025 value by class. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1442.077s">So</a>  90%, sorry, 88.9% of our value in the city of Medford is residential. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1449.82s">The</a>  remaining roughly 9% is split between commercial, industrial, personal and property. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1456.382s">If</a>  you just said today, you know what, nice job assessors, we're just gonna do a flat rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1463.684s">We're</a>  not gonna shift any of the burden. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1465.839s">we</a>  would just take the tax levy, we would divide it into the city taxable valuation, and we would get a flat rate of $9.70 per thousand that would be across all properties and personal property in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1481.547s">Instead,</a>  what this body has done in the past is shift that burden up to the full 175%. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1487.69s">That</a>  means that the residential class will see an $8.80 <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1493.952s">tax</a>  rate while the commercial class will see a $16.94 tax rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1499.076s">And</a>  this is, you know, might round by a penny depending on our tax rate recap. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1503.159s">So</a>  I'm just, that's one caveat. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1506.341s">And</a>  historically on the next slide, you can see, again, we were about 89% residential. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1512.325s">It</a>  brings that burden on the residential taxpayer at about 80% and about 19% on the CIP, a commercial industrial personal property. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1524.344s">So</a>  we again in past in the next slide you'd see we in order to get to that 175 shift we select a minimum residential factor which is multiplied by the percentage of residential property so it's basically a point <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1542.325s">9072</a>  multiplied by that 89% of the value. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1547.007s">And</a>  on the next slide, you can see what the outcome is. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1549.608s">So</a>  again, if we were at a flat 970, you can see a $9.70 or the flat one, it's a $9.70 tax rate for both. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1556.051s">And</a>  if you go to the max of the 175, 880 and 1694, respectively. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1569.52s">What</a>  did this do to the average single family? <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1571.201s">You</a>  can see in the next slide, by adopting this, you're effectively lowering the average single family tax bill from $7,800 to about $7,083. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1581.264s">That's</a>  the effect of the vote tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1590.529s">On</a>  the next slide, you can see the sort of the history of the average single family tax bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1598.271s">This</a>  was obviously debated earlier this year, as the councilor was mentioning. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1602.312s">We</a>  are seeing a $532 increase in the average family tax bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1608.173s">As</a>  I testified about a month ago, about 330 of that 530 was due to the overrides that were passed by the voters. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1618.615s">So</a>  that's resulting in an 8% increase year over year in taxes, the average single family. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1627.178s">So</a>  that would be the first vote would be on the 175 shift. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1631.059s">And</a>  then on the next slide, the second vote would be the residential exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1636.681s">Many</a>  communities do adopt the residential exemption, which is just within the residential class. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1641.063s">It</a>  basically pushes more of the burden of taxation onto the non-owner occupied <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1648.326s">uh,</a>  properties across the city, um, that would result in, um, properties at under $982,000 paying effectively less than taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1660.41s">And</a>  those valued, uh, more than that paying more in taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1664.451s">Um,</a>  this would have to be decided by the council, uh, earlier in the fiscal year in order to make this a possibility, uh, administratively. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1675.59s">On</a>  the next slide, for the small commercial exemption, the city has never adopted this due to its very limited effects. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1682.734s">It</a>  would be for owner-occupied businesses that have no more than 10 employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1694.239s">And</a>  just to summarize the three votes tonight, the selection of a minimum residential factor, which would shift at the maximum 175, <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1705.461s">the</a>  commercial class, and then a vote on whether to adopt the residential exemption and the small commercial exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1711.568s">And</a>  I'll take any questions at this time.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1715.071s">Ted,</a>  we also have on the agenda the open space discount. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1717.514s">Do</a>  we need to vote on that?</p>

    <p>[Costigan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1720.257s">We</a>  actually don't have open space, but we can vote against it, I suppose. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1731.379s">So</a>  it's kind of a non-issue.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1734.14s">But</a>  the recommendation would be to not- To not vote.</p>

    <p>[Costigan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1737.002s">Yeah,</a>  I don't see what this is correct.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1738.883s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1740.484s">I'll</a>  go to-</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1743.0s">Thank</a>  you, Ted, for you and your team. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1746.448s">I</a>  know you guys have been super busy. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1749.79s">But</a>  again, I think that questions people ask, usually this is later in the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1753.813s">So</a>  I would assume that this is tied into what's gonna happen in January. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1758.769s">which</a>  is the increase of the override to people's taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1762.734s">So</a>  the phone calls I received, should we come to these meetings, can we stop it? <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1767.216s">And</a>  I tried to explain to residents that, you know, so they can understand in layman terms that this is a tax rate that we are not going to put forth and whatever this council decides, plus what the override is. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1783.227s">So</a>  someone that's a million dollar home, you'll see, you know, that 7,800, 7,500 a year tax now then increased another, I know one resident <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1794.815s">was</a>  quoted about $800 for their home for an addition on top of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1799.856s">So</a>  I think this is why people are asking, why are we doing this meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1803.237s">I</a>  think it's, you know, I want to make sure it's clear that we're doing this so we can, that we give your team enough time to set this rate, then we can move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1812.419s">So</a>  in January, everything will be in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1814.86s">So</a>  just to let everybody know, it is happening in January that the override <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1820.929s">increase</a>  will be added in top of this, which the rates were, the new assessment, like was said, was assessed from the 2023 sales home sales, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1832.898s">So,</a>  okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1833.679s">So</a>  that's one thing I wanted to make sure that everybody knows. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1838.503s">And</a>  that, again, to be clear, this is year after year that the override tax doesn't disappear. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1845.348s">This</a>  just increases plus two and a half percent, if that so be it, every year to follow. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1850.693s">I</a>  think that's what the questions were. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1855.176s">And</a>  then the other thing that's confusing people when you talk about new growth, when you hear new growth in communities that have a booming commercial base or you're seeing a new tax revenue coming from new development, <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1872.407s">That's</a>  the new growth we haven't seen much in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1875.509s">So</a>  I want people to understand the new growth that we've been talking about during the override, it's new growth coming from increasing taxes that we see as the levy increases. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1888.615s">So</a>  I want people to understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1889.976s">So</a>  I think that was very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1892.158s">That</a>  was a question that's been brought up saying that, oh no, they've heard from some councils that said that Medford was number one in Massachusetts in new growth, which isn't true. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1902.286s">So</a>  I just wanted to make sure that those points were just brought up tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1909.251s">So</a>  it's a different new growth <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1911.903s">we</a>  talk about new growth and development is very different than what you talked about tonight, and new growth and tax assessment. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1918.047s">So</a>  am I correct with that? <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1919.968s">I</a>  don't want to speak for you.</p>

    <p>[Costigan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1920.809s">So</a>  yeah, yeah, new growth is just permitted, generally permitted work or any non-permitted work that was not on their assessment. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1930.755s">Okay,</a>  the last year, and we usually Jared or Jim will go out and they'll go to a permit and <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1936.582s">revalue</a>  the property due to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1938.903s">And</a>  so it's that. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1940.724s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1940.964s">It's</a>  a new assessment. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1942.444s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1942.785s">Or</a>  if an exempt property were to become taxable, that would be new growth.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1946.826s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1947.586s">And</a>  then I think that the last piece is what everybody's asking for now is what Mr. Castagnetti has been saying for years is the owner occupied. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1956.03s">I</a>  know it's a slippery slope because it sounds so easy. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1958.991s">So</a>  my neighbor who's 86 years old said, George, if this, if you vote in the tax exemption, I'm living a single family home. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1966.969s">If</a>  I'm if the exemption goes through for homeowners and I get my taxes would be lower than what they were in the previous years. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1974.078s">I</a>  said that's true, but when you look at the way we look at the big picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1979.064s">It</a>  affects. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1981.348s">majority</a>  of our residents in a negative way, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1984.631s">Their</a>  tax will increase even higher.</p>

    <p>[Costigan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1986.152s">Yeah,</a>  so the break even was prepared about 982,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1991.196s">So</a>  basically, you're typically what happens is your condo class, its value lower, let's say 500,000 is going to see a lot of that value exempted and see a lower overall. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2001.364s">But</a>  if you're in a two or three family, typically it would result even if you were owner occupied in a higher tax bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2008.069s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2009.21s">yet</a>  it shifts the burden from the lower value to the higher value. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2012.174s">So</a>  if you can help.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2019.127s">Because</a>  the word is out that Somerville does it, Cambridge does it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2022.048s">Why</a>  is it beneficial for their communities? <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2023.829s">What</a>  do they have that we don't that allows them to do that?</p>

    <p>[Costigan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2026.51s">Yeah,</a>  their break-even is going to be a lot higher because of their higher valuations and their more robust apartment class. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2035.694s">So</a>  there's more to shift onto. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2038.495s">Spread</a>  out more. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2039.275s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2040.156s">So</a>  typically, communities like that will adopt it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2043.857s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2044.478s">I</a>  appreciate you. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2045.578s">appreciate</a>  all the hard work you guys, your team has done. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2048.081s">It's</a>  been, uh, I know it's been trying. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2050.022s">I</a>  know that you were on the hot seat a month ago and I apologize for any, any, um, you know, um, uncomfortable questions that were asked, but I know it was, you stood there and did a wonderful job and, and, uh, we, you know, appreciate getting that out the Friday, the week before, so people can get a better understanding of what it looked like. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2069.24s">So,</a>  um, <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2070.39s">And</a>  I think that's why we had such a close vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2073.371s">It</a>  was very close because of that fact that people started realizing the true numbers and the effects that we're gonna have on the homeowners. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2079.775s">So</a>  thank you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2081.515s">Absolutely.</a> </p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2083.416s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2085.357s">Ted,</a>  just a couple of quick questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2088.819s">On</a>  this new growth here on the chart, this is new construction.</p>

    <p>[Costigan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2096.55s">Yeah,</a>  it's a number of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2097.47s">It</a>  can be like a condo conversion, the net of a condo conversion. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2101.832s">It</a>  can be any new construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2104.532s">So</a>  if it was a new plan development, it can be any exempt property that becomes taxable on tax rolls. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2111.135s">So</a>  it's a number of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2112.995s">But</a>  yeah, generally, permitted construction.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2116.38s">That'd</a>  be accurate. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2116.941s">This</a>  year, how much of it was like a condo conversion or an exempt building coming on versus just new building or major renovations?</p>

    <p>[Costigan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2125.148s">We</a>  had on just actually the next slide would actually help you help me answer that. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2132.354s">Or</a>  sorry about the previous slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2134.416s">So</a>  roughly, you can see kind of how it's broken down. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2140.717s">So</a>  single-family, we did have a development up on Winthrop, kind of a number of new single-families, but most of that single-family new growth valuation is from additions, renovations of existing single-family homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2156.241s">The</a>  vast, vast majority of that condominium new growth valuation is from Kona conversions. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2163.072s">The</a>  twos and threes and really four families, that's going to be renovations and so on and so forth with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2171.098s">So</a>  yeah, of that 1.5 of the 2.5 on the residential side, mostly single family permits, condo conversions, and two and three family permits. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2183.046s">Some</a>  new construction there. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2185.728s">Not</a>  that much, but some new construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2190.445s">Is</a>  that all? <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2191.066s">And</a>  then there were several exempt to taxable properties.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2196.631s">OK,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2199.194s">And</a>  are we getting better at capturing that or what's changing to drive the new growth numbers higher?</p>

    <p>[Costigan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2204.226s">Yeah,</a>  I think we got a really efficient process. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2208.388s">We</a>  are also working in tandem with our fiscal year 26 reval. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2213.21s">So</a>  every five years, the Department of Revenue makes the assessing departments revalue the whole community. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2219.373s">So</a>  we have to have a 10 year look back where we've gone to every single property. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2223.515s">So,</a>  you know, like this year, <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2226.4s">the</a>  assessing team has gone to over 7,000 properties. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2229.962s">So</a>  in that, if I tell our assessing team, if you're at a property and you see a finished attic that wasn't there before, and you're talking to homeowners, we have to make adjustments to the property record card to reflect that. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2244.77s">But</a>  we're trying to get accurate data and the valuations will follow that accurate data.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2251.934s">Thanks,</a>  just one more question on the residential exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2255.323s">The</a>  break even seemed a lot higher this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2257.145s">I</a>  think last time we talked it was in the high 700s, low 800s. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2261.268s">Is</a>  that just a major change in valuations or what happened there?</p>

    <p>[Costigan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2266.872s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2267.152s">So</a>  over the last two years, probably since we last talked about that, I mean, we haven't seen year on year increase in valuation, you know, probably I have to go back through the numbers, but let's say two years at, you know, over 10%. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2282.549s">And</a>  I have to look, it depends on what you shifted at. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2286.531s">So</a>  in other words, what what owner occupancy we assume. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2290.474s">So</a>  are we assuming that, you know, Medford residential parcels are 80% owner occupied or 70% and that's going to move the number as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2299.799s">So</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2300.731s">I</a>  know in communities that have them, it's sometimes surprising because you'd say, okay, single families, there must be 95% occupied. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2308.217s">Well,</a>  if you own the home in a trust and you're not the trust and the beneficiary, you wouldn't be eligible for that residential exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2316.144s">Or</a>  if you own the house in an LLC, or if the, not that people vacation in Medford often, but if you did have a second home and chose that to be, Medford to be your second home.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2329.352s">Got</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2329.712s">And</a>  I know you gave us the average single family value was 804. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2333.074s">Do</a>  you have the median?</p>

    <p>[Costigan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2336.675s">The</a>  median tends to be lower, I'm going to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2344.158s">Yeah,</a>  I believe it's slightly, I always screw this up, but right skewed data. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2347.32s">So</a>  yeah, we can get that for you tomorrow, the median versus the average. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2352.022s">But</a>  it tends to be, I want to say it's lower. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2360.031s">It</a>  was 768. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2363.312s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2364.093s">So</a>  yes, there you go. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2365.453s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2366.874s">Yeah,</a>  so it is skewed from a Belker perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2371.615s">So</a>  768 versus 804 is the average.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2375.677s">Got</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2376.077s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2376.317s">And</a>  I just say that because I think it would be valuable in the future if we could get <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2381.323s">figures</a>  on the number of residential parcels that fall below the break-even point and then those that fall above.</p>

    <p>[Costigan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2386.586s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2387.186s">Because</a>  I think the council has expressed interest in the residential exemption and would want to have those discussions.</p>

    <p>[Costigan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2394.45s">Yep.</a> </p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2396.091s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2396.431s">I'll</a>  go to Councilor Tseng then Councilor Callaghan.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2400.974s">Sorry,</a>  I think you had asked the main questions I had about the residential tax exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2409.969s">Could</a>  you, I know you talked about how we would need more time to set it up if the council wanted to pursue this option. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2419.835s">Could</a>  you give us a more concrete idea, or just in general, how many, if you need more FDEs, more full-time staff working on something like this, what that process would look like?</p>

    <p>[Costigan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2430.382s">It</a>  would be really front loaded in the sense that we would need an application from what we think is nine or 10,000 applicants across the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2439.884s">So</a>  it's processing to make sure that they are owner occupants. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2445.246s">So</a>  typically it would involve them submitting application with a form, their page one of their Massachusetts tax return showing that they are filing, it's redacted, but they're filing their Medford address. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2460.104s">So</a>  I'd have to kind of think about it, but I would say probably a full-time employee would need to get 10,000 applications in year one. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2470.913s">And</a>  then on a rolling basis, we would need verification on a rolling basis to make sure that the individuals receiving are still living in the home.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2485.789s">I</a>  know a concern that some have with a residential tax exemption is that it would disproportionately affect renters. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2493.87s">Is</a>  that something that, could you explain that a little bit? <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2497.871s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2498.791s">And</a>  could you maybe explain that in the context of the cities around us that do do a residential tax exemption? <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2507.733s">You</a>  mentioned that there's some things that they do that put them in a different spot than us. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2512.434s">And</a>  I was wondering if you could delve into a little bit of detail about that.</p>

    <p>[Costigan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2515.174s">Yeah,</a>  absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2516.194s">So</a>  there are a number of economic theories that would show, well, it's not an economic theory. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2522.416s">If</a>  you do a residential exemption, it pushes up a higher tax burden to all apartments, assuming that the apartments aren't owner-occupied. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2530.779s">So</a>  typically, it's going to jump up the taxes on larger apartment buildings by a good amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2539.762s">the</a>  tax rate shift is, you know, significant. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2542.864s">So</a>  let's say, you know, it's a 10 or 15% shift in tax rate up on large apartment buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2550.028s">It</a>  kind of depends if you think, do they just pay for that and or do they try to raise rents to meet it? <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2556.611s">You</a>  know, there's literature that shows if you're at the market rent, how much higher can they go? <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2561.769s">And</a>  this literature shows that, you know, that landlords do try their darndest to push that tax burden on to the renters. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2569.952s">Another</a>  unintended consequence that you would probably see in communities that do have the residential exemption is <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2577.799s">it</a>  does incentivize what you just talked about is condoizing. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2581.181s">So</a>  every time we have a three, you know, or a single family or two family or three family that condoizes, that's just a, you know, it's beneficial for them to do that with a Res-X because they're going to have a much lower tax bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2594.327s">Does</a>  that create housing stock? <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2595.587s">Does</a>  it not, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2597.959s">sometimes</a>  apartments will condoize that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2600.321s">So</a>  that can be, depending on what policy outcome you want, that can be an unintended consequences that you see more of a push to condos given the lower tax burden. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2611.07s">But</a>  yeah, it basically is a general shift from your condo and sort of lower value single families onto your apartment class and potentially three family and four family homes.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2627.62s">See,</a>  thank you so much.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2633.324s">Sorry,</a>  one second.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2635.805s">Yeah,</a>  the second part of that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2639.588s">Is</a>  there are there economic like, reasons why or contextual reasons why other cities around us have adopted the residential exemption? <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2651.455s">Or</a>  is it mainly just political in your in your study of things?</p>

    <p>[Costigan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2658.022s">Um,</a>  I think in communities that have a significant, um, income producing apartment, um, stock, you know, double or triple what Medford would have. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2672.748s">Um,</a>  it becomes, um, an option that's more palatable because your break even tends to be higher. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2681.031s">And</a>  so it's, you know, it, it creates a situation where like, if you, if council here were to pass it, most <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2688.874s">two</a>  and three family owners would probably see a tax increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2695.316s">In</a>  other communities that have more residential value that is in the apartment class, it kind of pushes up that number possibly, and more number of apartments too, because it's the median that you're looking at. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2713.342s">So</a>  it's the median value, yeah.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2715.543s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2717.978s">I</a>  think you'll go to Councilor Callahan.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2719.759s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2723.721s">As</a>  everyone has already said, thank you so much for all your work so far this season. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2727.662s">There's</a>  a lot going on for you, I know. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2729.163s">And</a>  thank you for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2731.897s">So,</a>  I have some numbers that are from housing Medford, and I just want to ask you if you think this is like close to accurate that we have approximately 47% single family homes, we have about 32% that have two to four units. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2751.004s">We</a>  have about 2.5% that have five to nine units, about 2.5% that have 10 to 19 units, and 15% or so that have more than 20 units.</p>

    <p>[Costigan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2760.488s">Yeah,</a>  so if you just go, President Bears, just to that slide on, I think it's slide five or six, there's a property assessment review. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2771.393s">You'll</a>  be able to see the breakdown. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2773.714s">Well,</a>  when I say see, it's kind of small. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2775.735s">Basically,</a>  the city of Manfred has roughly <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2780.061s">18,000</a>  parcels. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2783.302s">78,</a>  58 are single family. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2785.643s">37,</a>  13 are condo. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2789.424s">The</a>  next one, there's 24, and those are like multiple single families on one parcel.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2794.066s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2794.526s">Can</a>  you explain this a little bit? <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2795.446s">Because</a>  I just see these columns are like 101, 102. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2797.867s">Yeah,</a>  so sorry.</p>

    <p>[Costigan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2799.907s">101</a>  is the single family. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2802.908s">102</a>  is condo class. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2804.629s">These</a>  are just state use codes that they make us use. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2808.427s">The</a>  109s are the two, typically two single families on one parcel. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2813.93s">There's</a>  only 24 in the entire city. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2815.011s">The</a>  104s are the two families. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2817.592s">So</a>  there's 3881. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2817.932s">The</a>  105s are the three families. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2819.293s">There's</a>  461. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2819.493s">The</a>  111, 112s are the four family and up. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2820.674s">So</a>  it's gonna be as many as like 350 unit apartment buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2823.915s">There's</a>  116 of those. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2837.093s">There's</a>  693 130s, which are vacant land parcels. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2845.901s">There</a>  are 593 commercial parcels and 84 industrial parcels. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2854.429s">Not</a>  listed here are the exempt parcels because we value them, but they're not taxable.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2860.54s">Yep,</a>  so what I'm looking for is percentage of the residential. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2863.742s">So</a>  it's hard to find that in this document. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2867.505s">What</a>  I'm trying to understand and what I have from Housing Medford, which I'm asking you if it's relatively close, is of our residential. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2874.069s">We're</a>  talking about a residential. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2876.991s">We</a>  need to compare residential to residential in this particular case. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2882.094s">So</a>  that almost half of our residential, less than half is single families.</p>

    <p>[Costigan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2889.079s">Yeah,</a>  so I'd have to do the math quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2891.841s">I</a>  don't have it right with me, but if we added up all these going across up to the commercial and industrial, I believe we have, don't quote me, I'll give you the number tomorrow, like 14 or 15,000 residential parcels. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2905.73s">Is</a>  that about right? <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2906.33s">15,000</a>  residential parcels? <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2908.564s">Yeah,</a>  we can do the math. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2909.345s">And</a>  so, yeah, so about half, 7,800 of the, and don't quote me, but it's right around 15,000 to 16,000 residential parcels. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2919.291s">And</a>  I can get you the exact numbers tomorrow.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2921.012s">Yeah,</a>  well, we have to vote today. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2922.493s">So</a>  I'm trying to kind of understand this. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2924.314s">Okay,</a>  so- For this discussion, rather than waiting until after we have the vote, I'd like to have that information for this discussion.</p>

    <p>[Costigan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2930.539s">Okay,</a>  so if you let me go downstairs, I can print it out and I could come back in about five minutes.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2936.658s">Yeah,</a>  maybe I can ask a couple other questions first, so we can have everything at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2942.663s">The</a>  way that I'm looking at it, and I understand the arguments for that if you're above the threshold, then your taxes will go up. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2952.93s">If</a>  you're below the threshold, probably your taxes will go down. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2957.99s">It</a>  seems to me that we have, it looks like, just under 50% that are single family. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2966.132s">Those</a>  people are almost all certainly Medford residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2970.473s">Maybe</a>  30% or so of our residential housing is between two and four units. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2975.735s">Some</a>  of those are going to be Medford residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2977.855s">Some</a>  of them are not going to be Medford residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2980.896s">And</a>  then 20% is five units or more. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2984.177s">And</a>  those are almost certainly not owner-occupied. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2989.207s">It</a>  sure seems to me that if we are looking at this from the sense of how can we benefit Medford residents and how can we especially benefit Medford residents who <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3005.842s">Our</a>  working class are people who, you know, we have a really large cohort of people who moved here, when we were affordable, because this was where working class people could afford to buy, and those people most of them now are seniors, they're on fixed incomes. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3025.134s">You</a>  know, I'm thinking about this a lot because today is when we're supposed to be voting on this residential exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3030.099s">It</a>  is really our last chance to make a decision like this before the taxes from the Prop 2.5 override go up. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3043.03s">And</a>  so it really seems to me, and especially you have said that, what would happen is condos go down, single families, some would go down. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3054.318s">And</a>  then two and three families are the ones that are going to be starting to be the ones that are paying more, as well as the much larger properties. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3066.038s">you</a>  know, from my perspective, it really seems like we are now in that position, given the valuation that you, the sort of threshold of 982,000, that we really are gonna be benefiting almost all of our Medford residents, and certainly the ones who are most in need, by passing this residential exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3089.686s">And</a>  so my second question for you, because I understand that, <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3098.892s">it</a>  is considered that we would have had to do this earlier in the cycle in order for this to happen, but this was not on our agenda earlier in the cycle. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3108.82s">It</a>  sure seems to me that if the administration believes that this could not be voted on now, and it needed to be voted on six months earlier, then the administration should have put this on our agenda six months earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3127.08s">I'm</a>  having trouble with the fact that we are supposed to take a vote tonight, and yet we're told we cannot vote in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3135.243s">And</a>  I'm not blaming you. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3135.944s">I</a>  apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3136.504s">I'm</a>  looking at you, which I'm probably supposed to be looking at the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3139.227s">In</a>  no way do I think this is, I hope you don't hear me as if I am putting this on you. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3147.916s">I</a>  am not. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3148.997s">But</a>  I do think that this is something that we are supposed to vote on. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3153.581s">It</a>  is our job to vote on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3155.443s">This</a>  is something I believe would benefit <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3159.019s">almost</a>  all of the homeowners in Medford, except for those who own multifamilies and have some rental income. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3167.642s">And</a>  I am feeling frustrated that we are now told that we are not allowed to vote in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3174.564s">So</a>  my question for you is, what would happen <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3179.449s">if</a>  we voted in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3181.27s">What</a>  would the city have to go through? <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3183.231s">How</a>  much pain and difficulty and money would it cost if we voted in favor for the city to actually get this stuff done on time? <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3193.496s">Can</a>  we hire enough consultants or full-time employees or whatever to make this thing happen?</p>

    <p>[Costigan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3197.998s">Yeah,</a>  so we would probably get about 10,000 applications between now and the April 1 deadline, which we'd have to process and award. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3209.338s">we</a>  would have to issue basically 10,000 reimbursements because we didn't do it by the tax rate setting. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3215.922s">So</a>  any residential exemption that comes <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3219.588s">off</a>  the bill after the tax rate is done, which we have to do tonight to get it on the bills, has to come out of the overlay account. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3226.53s">So</a>  the city didn't, I guess, if you were to pass it, we wouldn't have predicted you passing it, and we wouldn't be able to fund the reimbursements we would owe people from the residential exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3237.993s">Is</a>  that, or possibly, because I don't know, I have to look at the numbers and see what the overlay account would be able to fund.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3244.514s">Can</a>  you talk a little bit more about the overlay account?</p>

    <p>[Costigan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3247.679s">Yeah,</a>  so overlay account, every municipality has, it is money that, you know, through the budget process, we put away every year in case we overvalue properties, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3258.625s">And</a>  so typically it is used if we basically, if as an assessor, we just overvalue something, which is rare, but it happens, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3266.949s">Maybe</a>  we have an under construction building and we pick up too much of it in year one, or maybe we just, our model for whatever reason, just overvalues a certain single family home. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3277.702s">Overlay</a>  is statutorily allowed to create an account that council funds every year to have to pay that amount, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3286.483s">So</a>  another thing it pays for is our senior work off because it has to come off the tax bill after January one. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3293.825s">It</a>  also pays for people who apply for personal exemptions, like low income, elderly and veteran populations who apply after the tax bill is sent out, but before the April one deadline. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3307.642s">So</a>  it's kind of like a way to unforeseen abatements and personal exemptions to pay for those. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3314.888s">So</a>  in this case, because if you were to pass it and we didn't expect that, all of the 10,000 or 9,000 applicants who do live here and do occupy their homes would apply and we would have to pay that money out of this account. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3332.482s">So</a>  I'm just, yeah.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3333.583s">Ted,</a>  just I think to clarify the point, <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3338.354s">If</a>  we were planning for the residential exemption, the tax rate that you would have submitted tonight would have been different.</p>

    <p>[Jared Yagjian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3343.944s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3344.325s">It</a>  would have been higher. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3345.607s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3346.809s">And</a>  the issue being if we pass this tax rate, <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3350.034s">Essentially,</a>  let's say 10,000 people apply for 35% exemptions if that's what we pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3356.018s">We</a>  would need to have tens of millions of dollars in the overlay account to pay back those exemptions. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3362.002s">But</a>  we wouldn't have raised that because the tax rate would be set based on not having that exemption, essentially.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3372.23s">So</a>  it's not that we would have to get out of the overlay account, it's that we would have to have come here to this meeting with an option <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3379.975s">of</a>  a tax rate that would cover that, but is the question that you don't know what that tax rate is because you don't know how many?</p>

    <p>[Costigan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3386.658s">No,</a>  you would have had to open it up at the beginning of the fiscal year so that we could have applications come in so that we could process it and build it into the tax rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3395.241s">We</a>  haven't built it into the tax rate.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3397.122s">Because</a>  you haven't had the applications come in yet?</p>

    <p>[Costigan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3399.123s">Because</a>  we don't have a residential exemption, because we haven't voted to have it.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3403.805s">And</a>  I just want to understand, you couldn't, for example, <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3410.083s">yesterday</a>  or tonight and we post on the news tomorrow, just saying hypotheticals, you could not come up with that number.</p>

    <p>[Costigan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3416.986s">The</a>  number of what?</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3418.807s">You</a>  could not come up with the appropriate tax rate for us to have a residential exemption.</p>

    <p>[Costigan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3424.43s">It</a>  would depend on how many residential exemptions are built into the tax recap we submit to the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3430.853s">So</a>  how many have I received at that point?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3434.875s">They</a>  don't allow us to estimate.</p>

    <p>[Costigan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3437.377s">No.</a> </p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3439.332s">So</a>  if you would open up applications in June, we receive 9,000, you could say we expect this, that would, and then, or?</p>

    <p>[Costigan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3448.577s">No,</a>  we would just, we have 9,000 as of right now, and that's what we're building with the tax rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3453.079s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3453.479s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3454.9s">So</a>  how does that happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3456.58s">Like,</a>  let's say we wanna pass this as soon as we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3462.623s">When</a>  do you open up those? <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3464.124s">I</a>  mean, since the city hasn't passed it yet, would the city have to then pass it <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3469.164s">This</a>  is what you're saying, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3470.864s">The</a>  city would have to pass it in maybe June so that you can receive enough applications so that when it comes to tonight's vote in late November, you can set the rate, which you can't set because we don't have any applications. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3487.047s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3489.948s">And</a>  so just again, to clarify, there'd be a separate vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3493.988s">This</a>  would not be the vote to establish the exemption? <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3496.229s">This</a>  would be?</p>

    <p>[Costigan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3499.619s">Don't</a>  quote me on this one. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3500.54s">If</a>  we had a city council, I would, or councilor, if we had, yeah, if we had a city attorney, I could ask them on the logistics. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3507.843s">I</a>  believe you can adopt it when you choose in the fiscal year, if you wanted to take it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3515.828s">I</a>  don't know if you could say tonight, we want to do it fiscal year 26. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3520.11s">I</a>  don't know about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3521.091s">I'd</a>  have to look into the legalities of it, but it is part of Astro law. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3526.283s">fairly</a>  certain you can signal that you are going to adopt it and then either adopt it in June or May prior to the fiscal year or signal that you're allowing applications in anticipation of adopting it.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3540.746s">Thanks,</a>  Councilor Calderon.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3541.606s">I</a>  would like to make a motion that we ask KP Law exactly how we do that.</p>

    <p>[Costigan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3553.528s">And</a>  Jared has some figures for you just on those.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3557.079s">Go</a>  ahead, Jared.</p>

    <p>[Jared Yagjian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3559.481s">So</a>  you were asking the percentage of the residential that's occupied stripped out vacant lands and stripped out commercial residential. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3568.507s">So</a>  of the 7864, we just divided that by this total of 16,025. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3573.03s">So</a>  it's 49.01% is the single family. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3575.092s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3585.067s">Do</a>  you happen to have the other numbers for like two or three families or over five or anything like that?</p>

    <p>[Jared Yagjian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3591.988s">Yes,</a>  so like Ted indicated, the 104s that were up on the board, I can do the math, the only math I did quickly downstairs with the percentage of the single family, but give me two minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3601.59s">It's</a>  okay.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3602.311s">We're</a>  apparently not gonna vote on it tonight anyway, so we can get another time.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3606.291s">The</a>  condo is 23. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3608.432s">I'm</a>  just putting this in the calculator.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3609.872s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3610.952s">The</a>  two family 104s are <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3618.201s">24%.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3621.002s">The</a>  three-family 105s are 3%, 2.9%. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3623.343s">In</a>  the denominator, you're using 16.025. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3627.185s">16.025,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3627.385s">That</a>  would be accurate.</p>

    <p>[Jared Yagjian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3628.525s">And</a>  then the</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3638.169s">number</a>  of parcels over that three families, so four and up is only 116, so it's only 0.01. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3644.79s">It's</a>  0.007, so what, 0.7?</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3648.871s">But</a>  that's parcels and not units.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3651.032s">Right,</a>  it's parcels, not units, yeah.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3653.032s">So</a>  units would be useful.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3654.893s">Yeah,</a>  I think units would be useful. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3656.593s">I</a>  think even also like valuation, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3659.674s">It's</a>  116 parcels, but it's probably 20, $30 million of valuation in that 116.</p>

    <p>[Jared Yagjian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3666.078s">I'd</a>  have to go back and look at the total valuation and add that up, but yeah, it would be up there.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3670.962s">Can</a>  I make another motion?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3672.243s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3672.604s">So</a>  we have, let's do this as a B paper and we can combine this. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3678.369s">So</a>  we have a B paper from Councilor Callahan, 2.1 request legal procedure to adopt residential exemption from KP law. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3697.236s">And</a>  then your second part of it is.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3698.657s">Thank</a>  you for the assessor's office to provide us with the percentages and numbers of the single family, two family, three family, four family, five to nine, 10 to 19, over 20. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3717.0s">as</a>  well as valuations, average valuations, I think, for them.</p>

    <p>[Jared Yagjian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3720.062s">So</a>  percentage of valuation by class.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3722.023s">That'd</a>  be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3722.903s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3723.163s">Or</a>  any other information that you think would be helpful for us to make a decision about a residential exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3728.486s">Understood.</a> </p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3729.527s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3729.847s">Yeah,</a>  I think that if we could add in the number of units above or number of parcels above and below the break even.</p>

    <p>[Jared Yagjian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3736.931s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3739.212s">Yeah,</a>  that too. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3742.834s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3743.971s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3744.351s">I'm</a>  going to go to Councilor Collins and then Councilor Scarpelli, I think.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3753.721s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3754.562s">Can</a>  folks hear me okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3757.105s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3758.286s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3759.027s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3760.909s">Thank</a>  you to the assessor and his team for this presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3765.478s">I</a>  will say I have a much easier time with this presentation now that it's my third time receiving it than the first couple. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3770.481s">So</a>  thank you, as always, for walking us through these technical and really important concepts. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3779.007s">I</a>  certainly appreciate the discussion around the residential exemption as I do every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3783.689s">And</a>  this is something that we have a really, I think, nuanced and important conversation every year around this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3792.074s">Because</a>  we want to consider, you know, this tool is a tool that exists, it's appropriate for some communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3796.617s">And</a>  I think it's really important to consider, is it something that would be appropriate for Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3802.32s">Is</a>  it something that would be appropriate for Medford now or in the future? <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3806.141s">What's</a>  that point at which kind of similar to the break-even point that we have to consider that the residential exemption itself would create? <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3814.386s">And</a>  I think for me, you know, based on the data that's been presented, <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3818.482s">Where</a>  I come down is similar to in previous years when we hear about that breakeven point we know that a residential exemption would benefit a lot of people who really deserve it, and we know that it would disadvantage a lot of people that would also really deserve it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3828.83s">And</a>  I think that we should absolutely continue to gather more information about what exactly this would mean. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3834.194s">for</a>  our community and as, you know, the character of our parcels evolves gradually each year. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3840.477s">But</a>  it's so important to get this right. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3843.279s">And,</a>  you know, as we know from other parts of this discussion, you know, those little changes make a really big difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3849.342s">And</a>  so I don't have any specific questions on the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3853.304s">But</a>  I would just say, you know, kind of on that point of where can we do <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3857.998s">where</a>  can we help legislate for the most benefit and the most help to our residents as we're contemplating the split in the tax limit? <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3868.183s">You</a>  know, for as long as I've been on the council, and I think for longer before that, we have adopted the maximum split rate, which shifts the burden onto commercial, industrial, and personal property, and maximally, as allowed by state law, away from residential properties. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3883.791s">And</a>  after discussion, <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3886.392s">I'm</a>  a fellow councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3887.233s">I</a>  certainly don't want to rush this discussion along, but I would be happy to make a motion to adopt the split rate of 175% so that we can continue to shift the tax burden maximally away from residential taxpayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3901.785s">Thanks</a>  again, Ted.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3904.467s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3904.727s">I'm</a>  gonna go to Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3909.351s">We're</a>  seeing things that, unfortunately, your department <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3914.011s">I've</a>  been tasked to do things way too late, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3919.052s">And</a>  I'm glad to see my fellow colleagues are now realizing after they supported the override that how the vulnerable community is really gonna hurt now. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3929.495s">They're</a>  hurting. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3930.576s">So</a>  it's something that I welcome the conversation starting earlier now to look at that homeowner exemption because of that demographic that I was screaming about <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3944.065s">that</a>  bought their homes for $50,000, but now they're worth a million, and they're being priced out with additional override taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3952.147s">So</a>  I'm glad to hear that we're at least understanding it now, and that there's pain. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3959.17s">So</a>  I think that's going to be something that we should do. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3961.99s">I</a>  don't know if you'll be here in June to do that with us, but we really need to look at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3966.592s">But</a>  again, <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3968.197s">We</a>  also have to be alarmed, as some residents have said when we talked about this issue, is that the burden falls on who? <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3975.864s">It</a>  falls on the homeowners that have rental properties. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3980.225s">Those</a>  are the ones that are going to pick up the burden if the exemption comes into play. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3984.649s">So</a>  the fear now is the talk that was started last year was rent control. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3990.553s">So</a>  I think that this is something that this community should really pay close attention to because there's a machine that's going. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4000.387s">there's</a>  a system in place and people have to see what's happening with our council in the direction they've been moving to, whether it was, you know, transfer tax, whether it's fees for a registry, whether it's an override, whether it's a homeowner exemption now and looking at rent control possibly in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4020.983s">There's</a>  a lot that this city is gonna be moving to if people don't realize and get more involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4028.055s">This</a>  administration, like my colleague said has done a, at least from what I gather, she was saying she was saying that they've done a terrible job, really preparing this community, and what avenues we can take to give us the best choices possible, both in a, a <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4047.896s">a</a>  speedy override discussion without the input and without the proper timing during the budget season. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4056.438s">And</a>  now here we go with the assessment and the levy that we have to look at, look at homeowner exemption as we move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4065.48s">So</a>  again, I appreciate what my colleagues have said. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4069.361s">It's</a>  something that we can't do anything today, but it's something that we, I think, have to look at early. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4078.211s">earlier</a>  in the season now, when we get to the budget season to make sure we have enough money in the overlay to make sure that if we have that 49.9% of homeowners that apply for the exemption, that we can cover that cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4091.48s">So</a>  again, thank you for everything.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4094.682s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4104.71s">Look,</a>  we could re-litigate an election that's already happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4108.812s">There's</a>  no need for that right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4111.693s">And</a>  I don't want this to, there are important policy questions that we have to vote on. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4115.295s">I</a>  don't want this to get sidetracked. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4120.117s">I</a>  think it's important for us to acknowledge that much of the choices that we make as a community about fiscal policy, about budgets, about tax rates, about burdens are <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4134.051s">larger</a>  normative questions about what we want the city to look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4140.559s">what</a>  this council has done is ask the public to vote on those questions for the first time in a very long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4147.2s">But</a>  that's all I'll say about the politics of the situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4150.701s">When</a>  it comes to questions like the residential tax exemption, I know this is something that you and your predecessors have come to the council before and talked about. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4161.463s">And</a>  while not all the councilors present may have been there for those meetings, I think a lot of the points that you brought up today <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4169.944s">have</a>  been asked and answered at those meetings as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4174.328s">In</a>  my first council term, I know, I believe a resolution was introduced onto the floor to hold a meeting talking about the residential tax exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4186.359s">While</a>  I think we can litigate whether <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4191.934s">you</a>  know, the administration should be the one coming to us or we should be going to the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4195.137s">I</a>  think that that's an equally important channel for the council to be the one stepping up and asking the questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4201.663s">And</a>  I know from this councillor and from a number of councillors who have already served on this council, we've had those questions and asked an answer before. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4209.91s">And</a>  I think I just want to take this moment and <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4213.283s">advise</a>  my fellow Councilors that, you know, that's a possibility that we have, is to hold a meeting earlier in the year, as we've done before, to talk about these questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4227.838s">So</a>  I don't think this is a question of, are we ready, are we not ready? <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4235.623s">I</a>  think for a lot of the Councilors here we've talked for a very long time about how all these moving pieces fit together and we've presented our vision, we understand that this is a policy question, we understand that this is a normative question. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4250.998s">I</a>  think it's frankly a little exhausting to have this meeting be sidetracked. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4256.26s">So</a>  I would ask that we focus on the important questions at hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4261.783s">And</a>  I would second Councilor Collins' motion for the 175% shift. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4268.166s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4268.526s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Callahan.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4280.657s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4282.058s">I</a>  hope it is not considered off topic to talk about the residential exemption that is on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4289.884s">So</a>  I'm just curious, do we have good information on the multifamily housing and how many are owner-occupied? <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4297.49s">Is</a>  that something that you could provide to us?</p>

    <p>[Costigan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4304.695s">Generally,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4306.595s">we</a>  don't code owner-occupants. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4309.216s">You</a>  don't know, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4310.057s">But,</a>  you know, we could... I'm just trying to think. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4314.838s">We'd</a>  have to probably do a canvas of those. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4316.359s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4316.799s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4318.98s">If</a>  it's something you can provide, that'd be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4321.321s">If</a>  you don't know, then yeah, I totally get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4323.842s">That's</a>  fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4324.122s">I</a>  was just curious. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4325.383s">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4327.724s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4328.164s">Any</a>  further discussion on either the B paper or the main paper? <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4336.058s">Seeing</a>  none, we'll go to public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4338.319s">Is</a>  there anyone who would like to speak in person or on Zoom? <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4341.559s">Please</a>  come to the podium in person or raise your hand on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4352.862s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4356.303s">So</a>  name and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4358.984s">And</a>  you can talk on any of the items.</p>

    <p>[Gaston Fiore]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4361.644s">Gaston</a>  Fiore, 61 Stigner Road, Wichita, Lansing. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4365.993s">I</a>  just took a few notes based on the discussion that I just heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4372.98s">So</a>  the first one is that I would, I mean, I really hope that before anyone decides to implement the residential exemption, there's a clear analysis about how much it's going to cost the taxpayer <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4386.553s">to</a>  implement this residential exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4388.514s">We</a>  cannot implement anything unless we know specifically how much money we're going to have to put into the assessor's office in order to implement this. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4396.678s">Point</a>  two. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4398.341s">So</a>  I would greatly appreciate to have the slides that I just saw, or I tried to see because I couldn't see them that well, before the meeting and definitely after the meeting as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4410.566s">So</a>  for the general public to be able to produce the numbers and even run some analysis if they so desire. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4418.97s">And</a>  so please, if we could have the slides available for the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4425.053s">Yes,</a>  and I did upload it when I got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4427.655s">Okay,</a>  thanks so much Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4429.296s">So</a>  it's on the council portal.</p>

    <p>[Gaston Fiore]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4430.277s">Thanks</a>  so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4431.678s">And</a>  point number three is that I was a little bit surprised when I saw, when I heard Councilor Callaghan kind of trying to, you know, talk about a vote tonight about either implementing or not implementing the residential exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4449.984s">I</a>  really hope that whatever we decide to change something or not there's extensive open public participation and not like here that there's only two residents in this room and I'm not sure how many in zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4465.723s">I</a>  really would hope that we do not have a vote on this without having had multiple sessions open to the public with a lot of advertising, hearing from homeowners, renters, business owners, and everyone in the Medford community. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4483.957s">This</a>  would be a big change. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4485.948s">independently</a>  of whether one is in favor or not in favor of it, there has to be extensive multiple open public participation sessions. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4493.252s">And</a>  I hope that we have those in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4495.233s">Thank</a>  you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4495.753s">I</a>  appreciate the opportunity to speak.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4497.614s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4500.615s">So</a>  first, we'll take the B paper by Councilor Callahan to request. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4506.338s">We'll</a>  go to Andy when we take, we're going to have a bunch of motions here. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4509.6s">So</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4511.246s">Yeah,</a>  we're gonna have five votes so, and you can talk on like the third one, wherever we end up. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4519.094s">We</a>  have a B paper from Councilor Callahan to request the legal procedure to adopt residential exemption from KP law and also to request from the assessor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4529.063s">The</a>  percentage of units and valuation across the residential classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4533.923s">And</a>  also I think as amended, if you would just include the number of residential units or parcels above and below the breakeven point for the exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4544.25s">So</a>  we have that motion from Councilor Callahan, seconded by seconded by Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4555.458s">On</a>  the B paper, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

<a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4982.568s">We</a>  also need real estate tax savings. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4986.451s">Somerville</a>  owner-occupied homeowners saved $4,053 last year with a cap break of, a breakeven cap of $2 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5001.76s">And</a>  Malden saved <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5008.289s">$2,690.04</a>  with a cap break even of at one and a quarter million dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5022.241s">These</a>  numbers are not fake. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5025.704s">These</a>  numbers I got from both city hall assessors in person. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5032.309s">I</a>  will leave with you these assessor <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5038.65s">City</a>  reports. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5040.971s">There</a>  they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5043.892s">I</a>  will leave you with the reports from the assessors and these reports with you to trust and but verify the numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5059.396s">P.S.,</a>  in the last 10 years, these owner-occupied homeowners in Malden and Somerville saved an average of <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5069.794s">$2,600</a>  per year in the last 10-year average. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5076.559s">My</a>  translation means we MedFed owner-occupied homeowners have lost out on a $26,000 savings in the last 10 years on average. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5091.469s">And</a>  that does not include lost bank and interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5098.476s">Page</a>  two. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5102.397s">People</a>  say you can't fight city hall, but I had fun trying for 19 years without success on this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5115.579s">This</a>  is my 19th time trying to help the average homeowner. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5119.52s">Here</a>  comes my 19th nervous breakdown. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5122.56s">I'm</a>  tired. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5125.661s">So</a>  now I am asking the homeowners <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5128.604s">in</a>  Medford for small donations to hire a real estate tax lawyer and a retired real estate tax assessor. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5138.811s">Andrew</a>  Castagnetti, 23 Cushing Street, Medford, Massachusetts, 23. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5152.62s">Here</a>  is the packet of information from Malden and Somerville City Assessors. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5162.617s">Somerville</a>  started in 1992. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5168.121s">Malden</a>  started the owner-occupied-exemption in 2008. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5174.926s">Again,</a>  I repeat, City of Malden saved the owner-occupied-exemption peoples that own the houses, that live in the house $2,690 last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5193.3s">And</a>  Somerville, as I said, started in 1992, and last year they saved, if they qualified, if they truly lived in the home, doesn't matter if it's a one, two, three, four, five, or six family, because it only applies to their unit, including Senator Kerry, if he's telling the truth about his address, and Beacon Hill. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5223.874s">That's</a>  a lot of cake, man. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5227.336s">And</a>  there's other communities, as you know, and it all started in Martha's Vineyard, I believe, or Nantucket, or both, this exemption, because the residents, the working class people that were taking care of the lawns and working in the restaurants that lived there, they couldn't really afford, but they didn't want people around with these mansions like ex-president <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5253.243s">Obama,</a>  who don't live there, they're not owner-occupied, and they get tired. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5261.925s">And</a>  this is how this law passed, according to what I believe is truth. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5268.067s">So</a>  I think I've said enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5269.368s">If</a>  you have any comments or questions, I really would appreciate it.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5275.389s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Castagnetti, and we'll share those around.</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5292.857s">If</a>  I can just briefly give you a moment of context. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5295.378s">When</a>  I lived in Somerville, I rented and it was getting very expensive to rent. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5302.922s">My</a>  husband worked for a tech company. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5304.743s">We</a>  sold stock to pay the down payment on a condo in Somerville because there was a residential exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5312.627s">When</a>  we were paying our mortgage, we paid less. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5315.253s">So</a>  when we were homeowners, because we had stock to sell, because we had enough money to buy property, we were able to pay less. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5324.638s">Sometimes</a>  residential exemption is what amounts to a handout to people with enough money to buy property. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5333.482s">To</a>  put that into perspective, sometimes that's what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5338.564s">That's</a>  what it was for me when I lived in Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5344.119s">In</a>  this case, I think in Medford, the break even does not make sense at this point today. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5351.025s">And</a>  I feel that our conversation about it is losing some of the context. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5362.514s">When</a>  our residents voted for the override, <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5366.886s">They</a>  were not voting to then turn around and exempt themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5370.707s">They</a>  voted to increase the property tax rate as they expected it to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5377.57s">That's</a>  what we're voting to enact tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5382.592s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5383.392s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5383.812s">If</a>  I may rebut.</p>

    <p>[Costigan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5392.456s">Mr.</a>  Castagnetti brought up a good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5394.058s">It</a>  can be adopted under Chapter 59, Section 5C. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5398.305s">There's</a>  a language that the mayor and the council have to approve, but that would be the adoptive language. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5403.773s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5418.713s">Can</a>  you imagine that the state senators had a hot, for the first time ever, to help the owner occupied to get a break on the real estate tax? <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5436.312s">I'm</a>  shocked that they did this back in the 90s, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5439.874s">It's</a>  amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5441.075s">So</a>  besides, the owner-occupied homeowners, they've carried the financial load for more than 100 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5455.545s">That's</a>  all I want to say.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5457.826s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5458.186s">Go</a>  to Mr. Fiore. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5459.087s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Gaston Fiore]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5462.605s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5463.846s">I</a>  actually had a question for the assessor. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5468.149s">So</a>  I had a question related to the breakeven threshold. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5471.932s">So</a>  Mr. Castagnetti mentioned that in Malden, it's $1.25 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5478.897s">And</a>  as I recall from the assessor here, he competed $980,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5483.661s">So</a>  I wanted to <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5489.645s">understand,</a>  either in this meeting publicly for people that are watching this, or in a future meeting, or I can do the research myself, I just didn't have the time right now, why, so a summary will I understand, because my understanding is that residential properties, they are more expensive on average than here, but Malden, I thought it was around the same as in Medford, maybe I'm wrong, I haven't looked at the data recently, <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5511.906s">So</a>  how is the break-even threshold computed and why is Malden's considerably higher than ours? <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5520.271s">And</a>  I think you, Mr. President, had a question that you said that a couple of years ago, ours was even much lower than 980,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5527.074s">So</a>  I would like to understand well, how is that break-even threshold computed and how is it going to evolve in the future and based on what?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5537.64s">I</a>  don't know if the assistant assessor, if you want to speak to it or Ted's going to come back. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5543.161s">It</a>  looks like he's might be coming back right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5547.762s">But</a>  if you want to go for it, Jared.</p>

    <p>[Jared Yagjian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5550.923s">What</a>  I would say to that is it's a little more complicated. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5553.883s">It's</a>  a, we, we have a formula in Excel where we have to assume, and I know he touched on it when he gets back, where we assume the percentage that, <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5564.38s">who</a>  will get the residential, will actually apply for it and get the residential exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5568.444s">That</a>  assumption plays into the break-even point. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5573.409s">So</a>  is it 70%, is it 80%, is it 65? <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5575.951s">And</a>  that really will change the break-even point in the calculations. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5580.475s">So</a>  we could put a spreadsheet together and have that as a toggle to show how that would impact the break point, but I couldn't do the math right now for you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5591.604s">I</a>  think that would be helpful for future discussions. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5595.752s">And</a>  just to add on to the context of your point, <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5598.76s">The</a>  issue is also that you're making an assumption of like how many people are going to take it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5602.983s">And</a>  the point is the break even point has to be set based on that assumption to keep the levy even. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5609.427s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5609.627s">So</a>  you're setting a new tax rate to raise the same amount of money, but you're basing that on the assumption of how what percentage of residential classes will not change.</p>

    <p>[Jared Yagjian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5619.653s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5620.374s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5621.334s">How</a>  much will get pushed.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5622.682s">And</a>  under this system, you may, let's say you have a, and this is just, I wanna clarify this too, like say you're in a three-family unit, one of the units is owner-occupied, the other two are not, would that whole structure qualify for an owner occupancy? <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5638.531s">So</a>  you basically would have people, even if they, let's say that three-family is worth 1.2 million, it's over the break-even point, they would have to apply for the owner-occupied exemption <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5651.069s">their</a>  taxes are still gonna go up even though they'll qualify for the exemption essentially, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5654.871s">But</a>  it'll just go up less than if they didn't get the exemption at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5659.453s">And</a>  I'm not saying that to make, I mean, it's a specific case. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5665.716s">Adam</a>  has it, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5667.137s">Okay,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5667.937s">Does</a>  that answer your question, Gaston?</p>

    <p>[Jared Yagjian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5673.1s">The</a>  percentage of people that would actually get the residential exemption.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5679.025s">And</a>  it's different across the different property classes too, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5682.268s">Are</a>  you mostly just assuming single family and condo?</p>

    <p>[Jared Yagjian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5685.03s">So</a>  just assuming out of the single families, the condos, the two families, the three families, and then the apartments, most likely would not get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5694.378s">That</a>  was the 118 of the number, that number. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5699.362s">And</a>  just to, while I'm up here, <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5703.314s">make</a>  the record correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5704.215s">The</a>  denominator is 16.143. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5705.916s">I</a>  did pull out the apartment. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5706.997s">So</a>  it's 48.65 for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5710.4s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5711.421s">Got</a>  it.</p>

    <p>[Jared Yagjian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5711.721s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5713.522s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5714.623s">Any</a>  further discussion on the motion to not adopt a residential exemption by Councilor Tseng, seconded by Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5727.413s">Seeing</a>  none in person or on Zoom, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.</p>
