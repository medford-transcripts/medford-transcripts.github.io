16
00:01:27,755 --> 00:01:28,876
[SPEAKER_01]: My husband's from Medford.

17
00:01:29,217 --> 00:01:29,657
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, nice.

18
00:01:29,697 --> 00:01:31,920
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, where we live on Winter Street is where he grew up.

19
00:01:33,542 --> 00:01:35,304
[SPEAKER_01]: Own a skincare salon on the hillside.

20
00:01:35,424 --> 00:01:40,629
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been there for almost seven years And I am a mom to a rising second grader.

21
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:44,753
[SPEAKER_01]: She is going to be She's so excited for school.

22
00:01:44,853 --> 00:01:47,156
[SPEAKER_01]: She is at mistook formerly the Columbus School.

23
00:01:47,256 --> 00:01:52,581
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, and I'm also a board member of the Chamber of Commerce Wow Impressive.

24
00:01:52,861 --> 00:01:53,602
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

25
00:01:53,662 --> 00:01:54,283
[SPEAKER_02]: Good stuff.

26
00:01:55,004 --> 00:01:55,864
[SPEAKER_02]: So all that

27
00:01:56,625 --> 00:01:58,326
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus you're running for city council.

28
00:01:58,346 --> 00:01:58,846
[SPEAKER_02]: I sure am.

29
00:01:59,086 --> 00:02:00,187
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome, awesome.

30
00:02:01,587 --> 00:02:10,031
[SPEAKER_02]: So can you give us like reasons or what it is that's, you know, why did you decide to run for council?

31
00:02:10,251 --> 00:02:13,253
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the major reasons you want the job, Paige?

32
00:02:13,793 --> 00:02:14,414
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so funny.

33
00:02:14,894 --> 00:02:18,597
[SPEAKER_01]: Had you asked me this a few years ago, I probably wouldn't have said yes.

34
00:02:19,177 --> 00:02:26,944
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think when I opened my skincare salon there, I've realized there's never really a good time to take a big jump into something.

35
00:02:27,704 --> 00:02:36,972
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've been very lucky to have been involved with a lot of really great initiatives and collaborations through the chamber and as a small business owner.

36
00:02:37,352 --> 00:02:40,235
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've already been in the room for some of these great decisions.

37
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:42,697
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just decided, well, I really want to help

38
00:02:43,357 --> 00:02:44,077
[SPEAKER_01]: get that together.

39
00:02:44,597 --> 00:02:52,639
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think my experience as a small business owner and now as a public school parent, it allows me to already have been doing some of those great things.

40
00:02:52,659 --> 00:02:54,719
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was just the perfect time to give it a try.

41
00:02:54,839 --> 00:02:55,059
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

42
00:02:55,099 --> 00:02:58,040
[SPEAKER_02]: So you really know what's going on being a small business owner.

43
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,280
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's important.

44
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:03,061
[SPEAKER_02]: And we appreciate small business owners in Method.

45
00:03:03,101 --> 00:03:03,781
[SPEAKER_02]: You know that.

46
00:03:03,821 --> 00:03:05,381
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a good thing.

47
00:03:06,481 --> 00:03:06,781
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

48
00:03:06,801 --> 00:03:10,222
[SPEAKER_02]: So you gave us some good reasons

49
00:03:11,142 --> 00:03:14,683
[SPEAKER_02]: why you're going to be running for a seat on the council.

50
00:03:17,084 --> 00:03:22,346
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have, I mean, whatever problems are going on, I mean, do you have any solutions for what's going on?

51
00:03:22,466 --> 00:03:25,107
[SPEAKER_02]: What's, you know, what's causing you to run?

52
00:03:25,127 --> 00:03:27,228
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have, can you think of solutions?

53
00:03:27,508 --> 00:03:27,828
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

54
00:03:28,148 --> 00:03:31,189
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, one, a few of them, of course.

55
00:03:31,489 --> 00:03:37,011
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very passionate and excited to hear that the charter has made it and will be on our ballot in November.

56
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:38,612
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's very exciting.

57
00:03:38,732 --> 00:03:48,321
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think specifically as a member of the board for the chamber and a business owner, ward representation, specifically in our business districts, is essential.

58
00:03:48,762 --> 00:03:59,752
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like the more opportunity that we can get people together and that we can get the opportunity for there to be a representative if people have a problem, they can go and talk to them.

59
00:04:00,192 --> 00:04:02,474
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that's a liaison, another step into City Hall.

60
00:04:02,554 --> 00:04:02,975
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great.

61
00:04:03,415 --> 00:04:08,419
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like to kind of parlay that too, it would be really wonderful if we could create roundtables.

62
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:12,663
[SPEAKER_01]: So essentially within our wards, we have the opportunity.

63
00:04:12,983 --> 00:04:16,627
[SPEAKER_01]: And I found this with everything with zoning, which I'm sure we'll chat about more too.

64
00:04:17,347 --> 00:04:18,007
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get into it.

65
00:04:18,067 --> 00:04:22,909
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a lot of information out there, but there was no way to fully gather it.

66
00:04:23,169 --> 00:04:26,591
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I have my clients in the room, I get to actively listen.

67
00:04:26,951 --> 00:04:27,471
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

68
00:04:27,711 --> 00:04:32,853
[SPEAKER_01]: And they come from all different neighborhoods, even outside of Medford, and everybody was confused.

69
00:04:33,173 --> 00:04:41,936
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think if we could have a good ward representative in your community, then every month or so, they can meet with our city service providers, City Hall, and the neighbors to chat.

70
00:04:42,716 --> 00:04:45,097
[SPEAKER_01]: I also think zoning, that's a big one.

71
00:04:45,117 --> 00:04:46,138
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll keep talking about it.

72
00:04:46,158 --> 00:04:46,438
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.

73
00:04:46,978 --> 00:04:49,079
[SPEAKER_01]: I think as a city, we do need zoning reform.

74
00:04:49,699 --> 00:04:52,780
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely that is not a question for many people.

75
00:04:54,180 --> 00:05:05,643
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you know, I've been speaking about it and how to include a lot of studies and a lot of individuals that have real life experience like Medford fire police, DW and our teachers.

76
00:05:06,283 --> 00:05:07,224
[SPEAKER_01]: and get their input.

77
00:05:07,564 --> 00:05:18,754
[SPEAKER_01]: So I feel like doing a slow phased approach focusing on Medford Square and Mystic Ave and then if we can support as a city, then we can look into our residents.

78
00:05:18,894 --> 00:05:20,856
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been actively speaking out since May.

79
00:05:20,876 --> 00:05:26,481
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also think a really great program we have that we need to utilize more is our vacant storefronts.

80
00:05:27,461 --> 00:05:34,262
[SPEAKER_01]: As a small business owner, I think it's really wonderful to find ways to make these squares vibrant, right?

81
00:05:34,323 --> 00:05:42,864
[SPEAKER_01]: If we want to continue to build Medford, we need to support the small businesses that are there, but we need to incentivize the business owners and landlords to actually want to come.

82
00:05:43,604 --> 00:05:52,046
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, and then pretty much my biggest thing is I want to create a space where Medford Fire, Police, DPW, and our teachers have a liaison to City Hall.

83
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:55,827
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like that is something that we're lacking, and I feel like I could be a

84
00:05:56,267 --> 00:05:59,430
[SPEAKER_01]: a great communicator as I have been within the chamber and my business.

85
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:00,671
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, I like that.

86
00:06:00,731 --> 00:06:03,935
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, yeah, that's a good one, having the liaison.

87
00:06:03,975 --> 00:06:05,336
[SPEAKER_02]: That is, that's important too.

88
00:06:05,576 --> 00:06:10,661
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now it's like non-existent, so, but we'll get into that another time.

89
00:06:10,741 --> 00:06:12,603
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we will.

90
00:06:12,743 --> 00:06:16,387
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so I know you're saying you're running as an independent.

91
00:06:18,588 --> 00:06:18,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

92
00:06:19,508 --> 00:06:22,069
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the reason that you decided to just run?

93
00:06:22,409 --> 00:06:23,129
[SPEAKER_02]: You're on your own.

94
00:06:23,169 --> 00:06:24,449
[SPEAKER_02]: You're running as an independent.

95
00:06:24,729 --> 00:06:31,911
[SPEAKER_01]: I am on my own, but I feel very lucky that I have a lot of support from my family, my friends, my clients, small business owners.

96
00:06:32,631 --> 00:06:44,993
[SPEAKER_01]: And because I've been actively listening to the questions and the concerns from different sides of Medford, I feel like I couldn't do a good job representing the whole city if I decided to just join a group.

97
00:06:45,593 --> 00:06:55,187
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to keep that open-minded space that I might not agree, or an individual might not agree with me, but I will always be available to listen.

98
00:06:55,608 --> 00:07:00,294
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have learned from getting feedback, which in the moment might not feel great.

99
00:07:00,915 --> 00:07:03,176
[SPEAKER_01]: I can learn something, no matter what.

100
00:07:03,417 --> 00:07:05,258
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm always learning lessons.

101
00:07:05,678 --> 00:07:10,781
[SPEAKER_01]: So I feel like having a difference in perspectives is huge for problem solving.

102
00:07:10,841 --> 00:07:17,205
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if we're all thinking alike, there's no way that we can get creative, and there's always something that you can learn.

103
00:07:17,565 --> 00:07:19,705
[SPEAKER_01]: So running independently is super important.

104
00:07:20,245 --> 00:07:21,346
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it's a little trickier.

105
00:07:21,886 --> 00:07:25,866
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but there, as I've learned, there's a lot of people in Medford that feel the same.

106
00:07:25,906 --> 00:07:31,647
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, kind of like some things on one side or some things in the other, but they really care about Medford.

107
00:07:32,088 --> 00:07:33,428
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm looking for that person.

108
00:07:33,488 --> 00:07:35,308
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I can do a good job representing them.

109
00:07:35,428 --> 00:07:37,008
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, I'm here to listen to.

110
00:07:37,629 --> 00:07:39,309
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all good reasons.

111
00:07:39,609 --> 00:07:41,029
[SPEAKER_02]: Really that great stuff.

112
00:07:41,569 --> 00:07:43,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, very good.

113
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:44,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Very good.

114
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:45,710
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and we need.

115
00:07:47,468 --> 00:07:53,050
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I usually don't give my opinion, but we need independent people getting involved in this city.

116
00:07:53,110 --> 00:08:01,652
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm glad you, and you know, we've had many other people on the show recently, all running as independents, whatever, but it's important.

117
00:08:01,892 --> 00:08:03,693
[SPEAKER_02]: We need some other voices.

118
00:08:05,414 --> 00:08:05,994
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's great.

119
00:08:06,014 --> 00:08:09,715
[SPEAKER_02]: You're getting perspective from clients, from, yeah, I like that.

120
00:08:10,335 --> 00:08:11,956
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're gonna work for all the people.

121
00:08:12,036 --> 00:08:12,696
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna try.

122
00:08:12,936 --> 00:08:14,036
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, you will.

123
00:08:14,096 --> 00:08:14,696
[SPEAKER_02]: You're gonna do a good job.

124
00:08:14,716 --> 00:08:15,117
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

125
00:08:15,257 --> 00:08:16,117
[SPEAKER_02]: You're gonna do a good job.

126
00:08:16,853 --> 00:08:19,195
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so you had mentioned it earlier.

127
00:08:19,235 --> 00:08:21,397
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to get right back on the zoning.

128
00:08:21,778 --> 00:08:27,443
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that is like, you know, numero issue right now in the city.

129
00:08:28,364 --> 00:08:29,585
[SPEAKER_02]: You brought up a little bit.

130
00:08:29,605 --> 00:08:35,671
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you like elaborate a little bit more on what your position would be or what you really feel about it?

131
00:08:35,691 --> 00:08:39,675
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you talked a little about it, but yeah, I think it's important.

132
00:08:39,855 --> 00:08:49,885
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I have to say, as a member of the chamber, I was privy to learning about it, but I feel like I had no idea what was going on.

133
00:08:50,426 --> 00:08:57,333
[SPEAKER_01]: And once I saw, mostly on social media, from other residents, specifically in the Glenwood neighborhood,

134
00:08:57,813 --> 00:09:01,614
[SPEAKER_01]: And on Salem Street, I was like, oh, wow, this is a really big deal.

135
00:09:02,274 --> 00:09:15,197
[SPEAKER_01]: And then just as a, again, business owner in a business district, I just kept thinking about, OK, well, if this is an impact, no matter what, I want to really learn about how we decided to come about that.

136
00:09:15,737 --> 00:09:16,977
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just started asking questions.

137
00:09:17,017 --> 00:09:21,078
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel really lucky that there are so many residents

138
00:09:21,878 --> 00:09:27,840
[SPEAKER_01]: in the community who have done so much research and they're open to answering my questions.

139
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:38,402
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I was writing emails and I was speaking at the community development meetings and some of the city council meetings and those are kind of the forums to really get those in those answers.

140
00:09:39,323 --> 00:09:41,743
[SPEAKER_01]: Residents did that and that's really incredible.

141
00:09:42,324 --> 00:09:51,106
[SPEAKER_01]: What I did learn is a lot of the questions that I did ask and they were quite specific about how we thought about zoning, the studies or the impacts

142
00:09:51,586 --> 00:09:58,790
[SPEAKER_01]: studies that were done to inform our decisions, and the real life examples weren't really happening.

143
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:02,052
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was happy to see that there's been conversations around that.

144
00:10:02,913 --> 00:10:17,081
[SPEAKER_01]: Since May 30th was the first email I sent out to the city councilors, planning and development, community development board, and the mayor, I've been actively asking, what does Medford Fire, police, DPW, and our teachers think?

145
00:10:18,262 --> 00:10:26,327
[SPEAKER_01]: and their union members, because they are, like myself, I have that real-life experience when I'm in a room with my clients.

146
00:10:26,528 --> 00:10:37,696
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so important to have data and it's so important to have similar neighborhoods or to see cities that have done zoning like this, but sometimes you need that real-life, like, could a fire truck fit down this street?

147
00:10:39,077 --> 00:10:52,377
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's questions about parking, like what does our traffic enforcement think, you know, and I feel like the more times you can bring those individuals that have real life experience into the conversation, it's game changing, and it's collaborative.

148
00:10:53,318 --> 00:10:54,679
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are my main points.

149
00:10:55,420 --> 00:11:03,125
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason why I did say publicly, slow down first, and then I said separate, was because I couldn't get those answers.

150
00:11:03,586 --> 00:11:05,167
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I was super honored.

151
00:11:06,028 --> 00:11:12,092
[SPEAKER_01]: And it wasn't in a means to create problems or trouble, but the fire chief did respond.

152
00:11:12,753 --> 00:11:14,194
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was so honored.

153
00:11:14,474 --> 00:11:15,235
[SPEAKER_01]: That he responds.

154
00:11:15,295 --> 00:11:15,735
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

155
00:11:16,335 --> 00:11:17,516
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought that was brave.

156
00:11:17,716 --> 00:11:21,880
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought that was incredible to hear, again, that real life.

157
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:23,401
[SPEAKER_01]: experienced.

158
00:11:23,461 --> 00:11:24,081
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what you need.

159
00:11:24,101 --> 00:11:24,362
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

160
00:11:24,682 --> 00:11:27,084
[SPEAKER_01]: So that has created a lot.

161
00:11:27,804 --> 00:11:31,267
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really still kind of unsure about where the process stands.

162
00:11:31,968 --> 00:11:36,492
[SPEAKER_01]: I was able to put in the last moment for public comment was the 23rd.

163
00:11:36,732 --> 00:11:36,972
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

164
00:11:37,012 --> 00:11:40,755
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did post I will share this in this will be on my website and social media.

165
00:11:41,115 --> 00:11:46,079
[SPEAKER_01]: I did share a question specifically in my area which my so we live in the hillside.

166
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:46,460
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

167
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:47,841
[SPEAKER_01]: My business is in the hillside.

168
00:11:49,182 --> 00:11:53,846
[SPEAKER_01]: But the way that it's zoned is where we are, there's going to be the proposed tough zone.

169
00:11:54,867 --> 00:11:57,229
[SPEAKER_01]: Where my business is, it's the Boston Ave corridor.

170
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:06,137
[SPEAKER_01]: And the zoning around that, and this is very similar to a lot of our other business districts, is called UR1, which goes up high.

171
00:12:07,238 --> 00:12:16,007
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would be wonderful and great in some areas, but where we are, it's a lot of single family or multifamilies, but there's those residents.

172
00:12:16,727 --> 00:12:23,254
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was my question was, well, if we're doing the tough zone, which is the goal is to bring back more students for Tufts.

173
00:12:23,654 --> 00:12:23,894
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

174
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:27,418
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are we then outside of the tough zone making the availability?

175
00:12:27,478 --> 00:12:27,658
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.

176
00:12:28,058 --> 00:12:41,366
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the questions that I feel like are really important to ask and if if there is true studies if there is community Response, which we've heard right foreign to and for for and against that would be great But we need to hear it.

177
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:42,947
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to see it and we need the consultants.

178
00:12:43,227 --> 00:12:44,148
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also here, right?

179
00:12:44,168 --> 00:12:46,690
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and I want to thank you for all that.

180
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:48,671
[SPEAKER_02]: That was good I you know

181
00:12:51,248 --> 00:12:55,192
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone keeps saying that, you know, the city doesn't want zoning.

182
00:12:55,553 --> 00:12:56,654
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not it at all.

183
00:12:56,754 --> 00:12:59,677
[SPEAKER_02]: I think everyone in this city is okay with it.

184
00:13:00,197 --> 00:13:01,218
[SPEAKER_02]: And you hit it on the head.

185
00:13:01,278 --> 00:13:02,440
[SPEAKER_02]: It's how we go about it.

186
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:02,740
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

187
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,902
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that was a perfect example.

188
00:13:04,962 --> 00:13:06,263
[SPEAKER_02]: Boston and Aft Tufts.

189
00:13:06,784 --> 00:13:08,386
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, and that's great.

190
00:13:08,466 --> 00:13:09,046
[SPEAKER_02]: That was great.

191
00:13:09,847 --> 00:13:13,849
[SPEAKER_01]: Funny thing, just a quick add, and then we can talk, because I know we have some other great questions.

192
00:13:15,229 --> 00:13:16,950
[SPEAKER_01]: So we live down the hill.

193
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:19,831
[SPEAKER_01]: So our neighborhood would be zoned, I think it's NR3.

194
00:13:19,891 --> 00:13:21,612
[SPEAKER_01]: So it wouldn't really change much.

195
00:13:22,072 --> 00:13:24,073
[SPEAKER_01]: And my neighborhood is already being developed.

196
00:13:24,353 --> 00:13:26,134
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're already living through that impact.

197
00:13:26,214 --> 00:13:28,215
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have that real life experience.

198
00:13:28,715 --> 00:13:32,097
[SPEAKER_01]: And a bunch of my neighbors and myself have spoken about developers that are doing that.

199
00:13:32,137 --> 00:13:33,357
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do understand that side.

200
00:13:33,858 --> 00:13:37,379
[SPEAKER_01]: Where I am on Boston Ave, it's nine units right in a row.

201
00:13:37,579 --> 00:13:39,160
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be ideal for mixed use.

202
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:46,383
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've put my business, which is the way that I pay my bills and support my family, out there because I'm not opposed to it.

203
00:13:46,723 --> 00:13:49,464
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do believe that there should be affordable housing above me.

204
00:13:49,905 --> 00:13:50,465
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes sense.

205
00:13:50,505 --> 00:13:51,625
[SPEAKER_01]: It's right near the Green Line.

206
00:13:51,645 --> 00:13:52,366
[SPEAKER_01]: It's right on Boston Ave.

207
00:13:52,746 --> 00:13:58,728
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to know how will we then support the businesses if there's business disruption, if there is changes to parking.

208
00:13:59,109 --> 00:14:02,450
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think those are the questions that we need to really just know.

209
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:04,911
[SPEAKER_01]: And it could just be this is how it's going to be.

210
00:14:04,991 --> 00:14:07,612
[SPEAKER_01]: But at least if we can put it out there, we can advocate for those.

211
00:14:07,832 --> 00:14:08,553
[SPEAKER_02]: Get some answers.

212
00:14:09,493 --> 00:14:11,495
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's my next question.

213
00:14:13,317 --> 00:14:17,641
[SPEAKER_02]: Another good one, I think, because personally, I feel this way.

214
00:14:17,821 --> 00:14:22,626
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, in Medford lately, there's no secret economic growth.

215
00:14:22,646 --> 00:14:26,690
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's best described as stagnant.

216
00:14:28,091 --> 00:14:28,471
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

217
00:14:31,172 --> 00:14:36,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have an approach or what would be your way of getting economic growth started again?

218
00:14:36,736 --> 00:14:39,577
[SPEAKER_02]: And just like, you know, I think we need to grow the tax base.

219
00:14:39,637 --> 00:14:41,739
[SPEAKER_02]: So any ideas on that?

220
00:14:41,819 --> 00:14:43,900
[SPEAKER_02]: Any things you'd like to see put in place?

221
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:44,080
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

222
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:47,503
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have, I think, three pretty solid ideas.

223
00:14:48,003 --> 00:14:55,648
[SPEAKER_01]: One would be zoning specifically, making sure that we can bring commercial development in if it's Mystic Ave corridor, Medford Square.

224
00:14:56,188 --> 00:14:56,388
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.

225
00:14:56,649 --> 00:14:57,309
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do that.

226
00:14:57,529 --> 00:15:01,273
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's work with individuals that will help bring in some money.

227
00:15:01,913 --> 00:15:07,498
[SPEAKER_01]: I think also a really great thing is Medford, as you know, because you're from Medford, there is so much history.

228
00:15:07,619 --> 00:15:09,700
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like we need to tap into tourism.

229
00:15:10,101 --> 00:15:14,264
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like if we can build a city that people want to come and visit,

230
00:15:14,885 --> 00:15:18,906
[SPEAKER_01]: they will spend money, they will stay, they will then visit those businesses.

231
00:15:19,406 --> 00:15:20,527
[SPEAKER_01]: That's revenue right there.

232
00:15:20,547 --> 00:15:21,727
[SPEAKER_01]: And we really need to tap in.

233
00:15:21,827 --> 00:15:30,909
[SPEAKER_01]: And especially what I got to see with the 250th celebration of the revolution and what Lexington did, that was incredible.

234
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:35,491
[SPEAKER_01]: And to see celebrities coming in, I feel like that's an untapped market.

235
00:15:35,531 --> 00:15:39,972
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the Chevalier, the amount of really wonderful and inspiring people who come in,

236
00:15:40,692 --> 00:15:43,316
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great and it's an extension of the city.

237
00:15:43,576 --> 00:15:44,937
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that is super important.

238
00:15:45,018 --> 00:15:46,720
[SPEAKER_01]: So really diving into tourism.

239
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:58,273
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing that I learned when I was learning about zoning and affordable housing, what other cities do is they will bus in the city of whatever, say city of Medford, would bus in developers.

240
00:15:59,194 --> 00:16:05,919
[SPEAKER_01]: And they would plan a day with maps and show them the available lots and say, this is what we want here.

241
00:16:06,259 --> 00:16:08,641
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what we see that could be built here.

242
00:16:08,761 --> 00:16:08,981
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

243
00:16:09,341 --> 00:16:13,504
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what our streets, sewers, schools would need to accommodate that.

244
00:16:13,624 --> 00:16:13,864
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

245
00:16:14,124 --> 00:16:19,068
[SPEAKER_01]: So we then incentivize these people and we let them know what's because if you don't know, you don't know.

246
00:16:19,088 --> 00:16:19,248
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

247
00:16:19,768 --> 00:16:26,674
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not a developer, but I would assume as a business owner, the easiest way to funnel something in is to show people that way.

248
00:16:27,035 --> 00:16:34,161
[SPEAKER_01]: So I feel like creating a really strong, it would almost be like a developer engagement program.

249
00:16:34,961 --> 00:16:39,405
[SPEAKER_01]: And then using our contacts, the Chamber of Commerce, who I love and super support.

250
00:16:39,425 --> 00:16:40,506
[SPEAKER_01]: Chamber does a good job.

251
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:41,147
[SPEAKER_01]: We sure do.

252
00:16:41,187 --> 00:16:44,149
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like that needs to be, that relationship needs to be much stronger.

253
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:46,871
[SPEAKER_01]: I myself, I'm a small business owner.

254
00:16:47,411 --> 00:16:48,972
[SPEAKER_01]: I love to volunteer on the chamber.

255
00:16:49,372 --> 00:16:50,352
[SPEAKER_01]: I love to help people.

256
00:16:50,412 --> 00:16:52,673
[SPEAKER_01]: I have friends that start businesses and they call me.

257
00:16:53,133 --> 00:16:55,294
[SPEAKER_01]: That is such a great asset.

258
00:16:55,354 --> 00:16:58,195
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of us have learned, like, I've had pipes burst.

259
00:16:58,255 --> 00:16:59,276
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had fires.

260
00:16:59,636 --> 00:17:01,437
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are the things, if you don't know, you don't know.

261
00:17:01,457 --> 00:17:08,540
[SPEAKER_01]: But continuing to support that and other organizations that are in the city, I think, will help make City Hall run smoother as well.

262
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,140
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we can bring in some dough.

263
00:17:10,701 --> 00:17:11,281
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds good.

264
00:17:11,441 --> 00:17:12,801
[SPEAKER_02]: Bring in the dough.

265
00:17:12,861 --> 00:17:13,882
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I like to hear.

266
00:17:14,342 --> 00:17:17,323
[SPEAKER_02]: Give the homeowners a break.

267
00:17:18,363 --> 00:17:22,324
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so you're a small business owner.

268
00:17:22,444 --> 00:17:25,044
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a member of the Chamber of Commerce.

269
00:17:25,104 --> 00:17:25,624
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.

270
00:17:25,684 --> 00:17:32,766
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, being a small business owner and a member of the Chamber of Commerce says you really care about the community.

271
00:17:32,846 --> 00:17:33,506
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's great.

272
00:17:35,186 --> 00:17:43,448
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, to me, I think small business, everywhere I go, is so important to community.

273
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:52,657
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, I mean, and I know Method, you know, if given the opportunity and we get them in here, they'll get supported.

274
00:17:52,677 --> 00:17:57,782
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, where do you see small business in the future of Method?

275
00:17:57,962 --> 00:17:59,844
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you see small business in the future?

276
00:18:00,144 --> 00:18:04,048
[SPEAKER_01]: So I feel like, yes, if we can be very mindful how we zone.

277
00:18:05,048 --> 00:18:06,989
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we don't want to push anybody out.

278
00:18:07,249 --> 00:18:08,349
[SPEAKER_01]: That is never the goal.

279
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:11,890
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to bring in, but we never want to push out.

280
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:17,491
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, myself, and many other small businesses, we don't just have our small business.

281
00:18:17,671 --> 00:18:18,971
[SPEAKER_01]: We cater to our clients.

282
00:18:19,511 --> 00:18:27,173
[SPEAKER_01]: I have 70% of my clients come from outside Medford, and then they go to Goldilocks, they go to Tasty, they go to the Chevalier.

283
00:18:27,973 --> 00:18:32,856
[SPEAKER_01]: or they moved to Medford because they've now come from JP or Rhode Island or New Hampshire.

284
00:18:33,196 --> 00:18:35,137
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is, small businesses are key.

285
00:18:35,457 --> 00:18:40,439
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I think another really wonderful thing about many small business owners is a lot of us have children in the school systems.

286
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:46,462
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are fully invested to building that up so that we can create those community connections.

287
00:18:47,163 --> 00:18:48,724
[SPEAKER_01]: There's this really great group right now.

288
00:18:48,804 --> 00:18:50,244
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the four elementary schools.

289
00:18:50,324 --> 00:18:51,525
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called the Citywide PTO.

290
00:18:52,085 --> 00:18:57,008
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of the elementary schools have parent volunteers, and we've been doing collaborative events.

291
00:18:57,688 --> 00:19:00,369
[SPEAKER_01]: to connect the four schools, but then to also raise money.

292
00:19:00,869 --> 00:19:09,791
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love that I can use my small business friends and chamber friends, business owners, the banks, you know, all of these institutions, and then we can help fund them.

293
00:19:09,891 --> 00:19:10,471
[SPEAKER_01]: They all help.

294
00:19:10,491 --> 00:19:10,831
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

295
00:19:10,971 --> 00:19:13,032
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just it's everybody wants to help.

296
00:19:13,112 --> 00:19:15,433
[SPEAKER_01]: So small business has to be at the heart of this.

297
00:19:15,793 --> 00:19:17,813
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has to be something in the forefront when we plan.

298
00:19:18,033 --> 00:19:20,014
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like that you're getting everyone involved.

299
00:19:20,914 --> 00:19:22,514
[SPEAKER_02]: The way you're doing it sounds great.

300
00:19:22,914 --> 00:19:23,275
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

301
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:24,135
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it is.

302
00:19:24,315 --> 00:19:24,855
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a

303
00:19:26,496 --> 00:19:27,056
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.

304
00:19:27,476 --> 00:19:28,477
[SPEAKER_02]: They go to your place.

305
00:19:28,517 --> 00:19:29,697
[SPEAKER_02]: They go to Goldilocks.

306
00:19:29,737 --> 00:19:30,997
[SPEAKER_02]: They might get a sandwich.

307
00:19:31,037 --> 00:19:31,757
[SPEAKER_02]: They might visit.

308
00:19:31,797 --> 00:19:33,018
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they go to a show the show.

309
00:19:33,078 --> 00:19:33,578
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

310
00:19:33,718 --> 00:19:35,378
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they go to the Ford like right.

311
00:19:35,518 --> 00:19:35,958
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great.

312
00:19:36,038 --> 00:19:38,419
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like the more that we can do that, the better that it will be.

313
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,759
[SPEAKER_02]: Should we throw a plug in for my friend Barry?

314
00:19:40,859 --> 00:19:41,400
[SPEAKER_02]: We sure should.

315
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,300
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.

316
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,060
[SPEAKER_02]: He's I heard he's on the chain, but he's on the board.

317
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:45,721
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

318
00:19:45,861 --> 00:19:46,261
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

319
00:19:46,401 --> 00:19:47,361
[SPEAKER_00]: Mrs. Murphy's.

320
00:19:47,401 --> 00:19:48,241
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

321
00:19:48,301 --> 00:19:48,981
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

322
00:19:49,181 --> 00:19:49,742
[SPEAKER_00]: Great guy.

323
00:19:49,782 --> 00:19:51,542
[SPEAKER_01]: Good supporter of all.

324
00:19:51,602 --> 00:19:51,722
[SPEAKER_01]: He is.

325
00:19:51,762 --> 00:19:52,202
[SPEAKER_00]: He is.

326
00:19:52,522 --> 00:19:55,483
[SPEAKER_01]: All Medford restaurants, schools, people.

327
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:55,683
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

328
00:19:57,315 --> 00:20:00,119
[SPEAKER_02]: Good old Barry Rafferty, yeah, he's a good guy.

329
00:20:03,062 --> 00:20:14,217
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so now let's ask, I gotta ask a few, I call this a personal question, it isn't really, but

330
00:20:15,729 --> 00:20:18,971
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, what are your least most favorite things to do in Method?

331
00:20:19,331 --> 00:20:20,431
[SPEAKER_02]: Which order should I go first?

332
00:20:20,531 --> 00:20:22,432
[SPEAKER_02]: Least or favorite?

333
00:20:22,492 --> 00:20:23,753
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do the least first.

334
00:20:23,773 --> 00:20:24,553
[SPEAKER_02]: Get it out of the way.

335
00:20:24,593 --> 00:20:25,954
[SPEAKER_02]: Least favorite thing to do.

336
00:20:26,194 --> 00:20:29,376
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was a hard one for me because I never try to go negative.

337
00:20:29,556 --> 00:20:32,637
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I could say is what I would like to strengthen.

338
00:20:32,897 --> 00:20:33,758
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

339
00:20:33,918 --> 00:20:41,922
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially because I'm on the hillside and this is always a, you know, a neighborhood thing is our relationship as a city with Tufts University.

340
00:20:42,222 --> 00:20:42,402
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

341
00:20:42,762 --> 00:20:45,907
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like that is an untapped market.

342
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:56,642
[SPEAKER_01]: The one thing I can say is because of where I am on the hillside with the chamber, but also just I went to a manual college and I have a great connection with now Tufts Athletics.

343
00:20:57,683 --> 00:21:10,080
[SPEAKER_01]: Any time for some of these PTO events that I've needed help and I've called Tufts, whether it's community relations or the Tufts student athletes, some were my clients, they always volunteer.

344
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:13,926
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of those PTO events that I was just a very small part of,

345
00:21:14,086 --> 00:21:14,626
[SPEAKER_01]: organizing.

346
00:21:14,746 --> 00:21:16,007
[SPEAKER_01]: It was at the Great American Beer Hall.

347
00:21:16,247 --> 00:21:18,608
[SPEAKER_01]: The Citywide PTO did an excellent job.

348
00:21:19,108 --> 00:21:20,328
[SPEAKER_01]: It was insane.

349
00:21:20,789 --> 00:21:28,932
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just asked my friends at Tufts, the student liaisons for the athletes, and we got like 30 student athletes that came and participated and volunteered.

350
00:21:29,632 --> 00:21:31,913
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you ask, they will help.

351
00:21:32,093 --> 00:21:36,034
[SPEAKER_01]: But things that I learned when I've been researching and sitting in some of the community meetings is

352
00:21:37,555 --> 00:21:40,457
[SPEAKER_01]: they're a big part of the footprint up on the hillside.

353
00:21:41,278 --> 00:21:44,781
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we know, it's a university, so we understand about taxes.

354
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:47,923
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I didn't know about was the pilot programs.

355
00:21:48,023 --> 00:21:48,784
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know about that?

356
00:21:49,064 --> 00:21:50,986
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I, a little bit.

357
00:21:51,086 --> 00:21:51,406
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

358
00:21:51,506 --> 00:21:52,127
[SPEAKER_02]: Not enough.

359
00:21:52,307 --> 00:21:53,868
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think anyone really knows about

360
00:21:54,068 --> 00:21:55,749
[SPEAKER_01]: No, so it's been interesting.

361
00:21:55,829 --> 00:22:00,771
[SPEAKER_01]: So essentially, it's if you are like a nonprofit or university, you're not paying taxes.

362
00:22:01,231 --> 00:22:09,915
[SPEAKER_01]: But Medford has in the past received payments from Tufts, and it's to support infrastructure, it's support the schools.

363
00:22:10,535 --> 00:22:14,097
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think if we were negotiating there, I would have to fact check this.

364
00:22:14,217 --> 00:22:16,138
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't think there is a permanent

365
00:22:16,938 --> 00:22:17,658
[SPEAKER_01]: pilot program.

366
00:22:17,678 --> 00:22:19,239
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that would be a great idea.

367
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:27,122
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say Tufts, you're here, you're part of, you know, you help our small businesses, but you also help, you know, with housing.

368
00:22:27,422 --> 00:22:29,062
[SPEAKER_01]: So why don't we see what we can do there?

369
00:22:29,382 --> 00:22:30,523
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would be a pilot program.

370
00:22:31,143 --> 00:22:32,303
[SPEAKER_01]: I also think we're in the Vogue.

371
00:22:32,523 --> 00:22:40,686
[SPEAKER_01]: This is such a great space, internship opportunities, like Tufts, that is a great opportunity for all of the Vogue, but any student really.

372
00:22:41,186 --> 00:22:42,727
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said, if we can ask,

373
00:22:43,007 --> 00:22:52,631
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's just we need to make sure we create that strong, that Tufts is in Medford, but we are not Tufts, we are Medford, and they're a neighbor, but they also need to be a willing participant.

374
00:22:53,071 --> 00:23:02,354
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have seen them come to the table, but I feel like that would be a really great opportunity to strengthen, and that would help also infuse some of our money.

375
00:23:02,935 --> 00:23:03,855
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to tell you something.

376
00:23:03,875 --> 00:23:04,996
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been here all my life.

377
00:23:05,016 --> 00:23:08,157
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to get too much into it, but when I was young,

378
00:23:09,057 --> 00:23:10,818
[SPEAKER_02]: We used Tufts College.

379
00:23:11,398 --> 00:23:13,678
[SPEAKER_02]: They allowed us to use the college.

380
00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:16,719
[SPEAKER_02]: We had Spicer Field in South Method.

381
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:19,320
[SPEAKER_02]: They did a ton of things for this city.

382
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:22,281
[SPEAKER_02]: We used to have a lot of parades.

383
00:23:23,281 --> 00:23:26,602
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything we did, Tufts used to get involved with Method.

384
00:23:27,063 --> 00:23:30,163
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're right, it's not there anymore.

385
00:23:31,004 --> 00:23:32,004
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be nice to have.

386
00:23:32,044 --> 00:23:35,025
[SPEAKER_02]: So we used to use, back in my day, it was Cousins Gym.

387
00:23:35,585 --> 00:23:49,248
[SPEAKER_02]: we used to use it for baseball tryouts and They used to let us go in there and you know, they give it to us for an hour or two Whatever it was we could practice baseball It was so nice, but it's like I don't know.

388
00:23:49,288 --> 00:23:58,130
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like things are shut off now like so I feel like if we could infuse that would be great and that's I think that's the part is it can't hurt to ask

389
00:23:58,631 --> 00:24:01,354
[SPEAKER_01]: The worst thing happens is a no, but at least it's a try.

390
00:24:01,414 --> 00:24:02,316
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the things.

391
00:24:02,436 --> 00:24:05,240
[SPEAKER_01]: And then hopefully we can bring in some more connections.

392
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:05,620
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

393
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:09,265
[SPEAKER_01]: So you gave me an almost least favorite thing, but I love that.

394
00:24:09,285 --> 00:24:10,006
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.

395
00:24:10,507 --> 00:24:12,229
[SPEAKER_01]: So most favorite.

396
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:12,730
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

397
00:24:12,991 --> 00:24:13,952
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your most favorite?

398
00:24:14,152 --> 00:24:15,153
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's so many things.

399
00:24:15,233 --> 00:24:21,796
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I could do all of the great small businesses and how we could really become a Mecca of the food world with everything going.

400
00:24:21,856 --> 00:24:28,880
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think the easiest and most important thing about Medford is the convenience factor of you can get in and out.

401
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,901
[SPEAKER_01]: We have now the Green Line.

402
00:24:31,041 --> 00:24:32,121
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the commuter rail.

403
00:24:32,722 --> 00:24:33,722
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm right near Route 16.

404
00:24:33,762 --> 00:24:34,082
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm 93.

405
00:24:34,643 --> 00:24:42,987
[SPEAKER_01]: But as somebody who's from Holliston, which is pretty rural, there's farms, there's field, there are places in Medford that you go and you forget that you're so close to the city.

406
00:24:43,587 --> 00:24:45,530
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and we live right near Memorial.

407
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:49,314
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have the mystic river, the boat club up at the mystic lakes, right?

408
00:24:49,334 --> 00:24:51,277
[SPEAKER_01]: The pond, the sheep's fold.

409
00:24:51,697 --> 00:24:55,602
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can go and all of a sudden there's deer because you're in Oak Grove, right?

410
00:24:55,622 --> 00:24:57,965
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard a deer or there's a great blue heron that flew by.

411
00:24:58,505 --> 00:25:04,892
[SPEAKER_01]: So even though we are so conveniently close to the city, north, south, east, west, you have those like glimmers.

412
00:25:05,352 --> 00:25:08,796
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when I join the chamber, I help out with communications.

413
00:25:09,236 --> 00:25:13,540
[SPEAKER_01]: Not being from Medford, I just went to the library and did it, which I'll plug the library all day.

414
00:25:14,241 --> 00:25:15,122
[SPEAKER_01]: Me too.

415
00:25:15,282 --> 00:25:15,843
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the library.

416
00:25:15,863 --> 00:25:16,503
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good library.

417
00:25:16,583 --> 00:25:17,124
[SPEAKER_03]: It's such a good library.

418
00:25:17,324 --> 00:25:30,891
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it is and we um, I did a deep dive because if I wanted to help share information about medford There's so much history and I feel like when it comes back to who I am and what i'm doing for You know medford city my city council run, right?

419
00:25:31,111 --> 00:25:44,678
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really learning from history talking to the people who've lived here Thinking about how we can continue to grow and finding ways because medford has been around as one of I mean It's like the sixth or seventh city like it's

420
00:25:45,318 --> 00:25:47,139
[SPEAKER_01]: been established for a very long time.

421
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:51,322
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of great history, but there's these gems that I feel like we're very lucky to have.

422
00:25:51,342 --> 00:25:51,863
[SPEAKER_01]: There is.

423
00:25:52,003 --> 00:25:53,344
[SPEAKER_02]: No, there's a lot of gems.

424
00:25:53,364 --> 00:25:55,065
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of good things.

425
00:25:55,145 --> 00:25:55,405
[SPEAKER_02]: There is.

426
00:25:55,445 --> 00:25:56,286
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there is.

427
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:58,367
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got to take more advantage of them, I think.

428
00:25:58,407 --> 00:26:00,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think that's a good answer.

429
00:26:00,889 --> 00:26:03,971
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we continue to share it, then I can help with tourism.

430
00:26:04,071 --> 00:26:04,351
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

431
00:26:04,671 --> 00:26:05,272
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you're right.

432
00:26:05,912 --> 00:26:06,733
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely right.

433
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:12,163
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so now we're going to do the last and the most important question.

434
00:26:12,343 --> 00:26:12,524
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

435
00:26:12,724 --> 00:26:13,124
[SPEAKER_02]: OK?

436
00:26:13,725 --> 00:26:22,012
[SPEAKER_02]: If someone wants to get in touch or get to know you or any, how would they get in touch with you?

437
00:26:22,052 --> 00:26:27,297
[SPEAKER_02]: How do they communicate with you if they want to find Page Buldini?

438
00:26:28,633 --> 00:26:29,333
[SPEAKER_02]: How do they do it?

439
00:26:29,433 --> 00:26:33,155
[SPEAKER_01]: So the best way is my email, which is pageboldini at gmail.com.

440
00:26:33,756 --> 00:26:37,157
[SPEAKER_01]: I have my website, which is electpageboldini.com.

441
00:26:37,758 --> 00:26:40,679
[SPEAKER_01]: I also have Instagram, which is pageboldini.

442
00:26:40,959 --> 00:26:44,041
[SPEAKER_01]: I have Facebook, which is pageboldini medford city council.

443
00:26:45,822 --> 00:26:48,724
[SPEAKER_01]: I have been getting coffee with everyone possible.

444
00:26:49,985 --> 00:27:04,976
[SPEAKER_01]: When I decided to pursue the idea of running for city council, I asked every elected official from city council, mayor, state rep, and school committee, and I almost was successful in getting and having coffee or meeting with everyone.

445
00:27:05,116 --> 00:27:06,156
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of it was just schedules.

446
00:27:06,997 --> 00:27:13,602
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was so helpful because I figured if I can get myself to city hall, I always want to start off with the right foot forward in a positive way.

447
00:27:14,102 --> 00:27:16,084
[SPEAKER_01]: And I learned a lot and everybody was very helpful.

448
00:27:17,745 --> 00:27:18,386
[SPEAKER_01]: I will get coffee.

449
00:27:18,426 --> 00:27:19,406
[SPEAKER_01]: I will have coffee with anybody.

450
00:27:19,467 --> 00:27:20,968
[SPEAKER_01]: I had two coffees today.

451
00:27:20,988 --> 00:27:21,668
[SPEAKER_01]: One was decaf.

452
00:27:23,049 --> 00:27:23,950
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm open to listen.

453
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:24,671
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here.

454
00:27:24,691 --> 00:27:25,772
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here to learn.

455
00:27:26,332 --> 00:27:31,136
[SPEAKER_01]: I only know what I know, but I am very open to hearing others because they know better than me for some things.

456
00:27:31,276 --> 00:27:33,018
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I know it's that's how you get.

457
00:27:33,638 --> 00:27:40,647
[SPEAKER_02]: You gain knowledge, experience, you're hearing from, and it's all different people you're talking to, and that's the thing, you get in the whole mix.

458
00:27:41,588 --> 00:27:47,155
[SPEAKER_02]: And Method, like I say, I think today, I don't know, I just think it's more divided than it's ever been.

459
00:27:47,215 --> 00:27:49,719
[SPEAKER_02]: We were always like one big community.

460
00:27:50,828 --> 00:27:53,369
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't like it the way it gets like that.

461
00:27:53,629 --> 00:27:56,691
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some great events right now, too.

462
00:27:56,771 --> 00:28:01,913
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I'll be at National Night Out with the Chamber, so I'll be good, and I'm sponsoring the dunk tank.

463
00:28:02,173 --> 00:28:02,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, there you go.

464
00:28:03,034 --> 00:28:05,295
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll be there.

465
00:28:05,335 --> 00:28:07,095
[SPEAKER_01]: That's next week.

466
00:28:07,536 --> 00:28:09,296
[SPEAKER_01]: For the Chamber, we have great events, too.

467
00:28:09,436 --> 00:28:10,497
[SPEAKER_01]: We have Run Medford.

468
00:28:10,817 --> 00:28:11,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

469
00:28:11,277 --> 00:28:12,198
[SPEAKER_01]: That's big.

470
00:28:12,398 --> 00:28:21,263
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so excited because as a Missittuck parent, and the Missittuck PTO is so great, I'm just like a supporter on the outside.

471
00:28:21,283 --> 00:28:22,784
[SPEAKER_01]: They're incredible.

472
00:28:23,604 --> 00:28:31,709
[SPEAKER_01]: It was brought to my attention that they were looking to do for the Citywide PTO, the four elementary schools, a road race to raise funds, kind of like the Jingle Bell once was.

473
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:50,989
[SPEAKER_01]: And around the same time, Dave McGillivray, who is awesome, and we love, and Denise, and the whole crew, DSME, he is a Chamber member, and he was talking about Run Medford, which the Chamber is a proud sponsor as well, and I just had the idea, like, what if we connect?

474
00:28:51,149 --> 00:28:53,312
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I pitched it to the Chamber and Dave, and they were like,

475
00:28:53,692 --> 00:28:54,152
[SPEAKER_01]: please.

476
00:28:54,432 --> 00:28:56,173
[SPEAKER_01]: So then I pitched it to the citywide PTO.

477
00:28:56,233 --> 00:28:58,074
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm so proud and honored.

478
00:28:58,475 --> 00:28:59,515
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a great race.

479
00:28:59,615 --> 00:29:01,116
[SPEAKER_01]: It's September 26 and seven.

480
00:29:01,196 --> 00:29:02,257
[SPEAKER_01]: The kids run is Friday.

481
00:29:02,277 --> 00:29:05,398
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we're gonna have like a rager Saturday is going to be epic.

482
00:29:05,478 --> 00:29:10,661
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Dave offered to cut an equal check to all eight.

483
00:29:10,701 --> 00:29:20,526
[SPEAKER_01]: So not just our nice eight of the schools like Curtis Tufts, the high school, so he really truly is supporting so run Medford and then Oktoberfest with the chamber.

484
00:29:20,807 --> 00:29:22,327
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a really big one.

485
00:29:22,347 --> 00:29:23,268
[SPEAKER_01]: This is our hundredth year

486
00:29:23,548 --> 00:29:25,472
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, very, very nice.

487
00:29:25,492 --> 00:29:29,779
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are all events that I will be nice to see the chambers really doing a lot.

488
00:29:29,819 --> 00:29:30,100
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.

489
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:33,866
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we have these organizations and I don't think people.

490

[SPEAKER_02]: really know what, you know, you guys do a lot, all the organizations.

[SPEAKER_02]: The Rotary Club, they got in touch with us.

494
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:47,423
[SPEAKER_02]: We're having them on at the end of the month.

495
00:29:47,463 --> 00:29:48,684
