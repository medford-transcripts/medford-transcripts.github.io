I also see Councilor Scarpelli here.

13
00:00:18,339 --> 00:00:20,140
For present one absent meetings called to order.

14
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,162
There'll be a meeting in the Medford City Council Administration Finance Committee, May 21st, 2024 at 6 p.m.

15
00:00:25,182 --> 00:00:29,363
in the Medford City Council Chamber, second floor, Medford City Hall 85, George P. Hassett Drive, Medford M.A.

16
00:00:29,383 --> 00:00:30,064
and by Zoom.

17
00:00:30,644 --> 00:00:37,527
Purpose of this meeting is to discuss paper 24-025 offered by Councilor Lemming regarding commercial vacancy tax.

18
00:00:38,647 --> 00:00:43,409
The full description is whereas the City of Medford has many commercial storefronts that are either vacant or

19
00:00:44,082 --> 00:00:49,166
for that are either vacant for unacceptably long periods of time, or are rarely and inconsistently open for business.

20
00:00:49,346 --> 00:00:55,551
And whereas there exists insufficient incentive for owners of such property to maintain and rent storefronts to active businesses.

21
00:00:55,611 --> 00:01:05,199
Now, therefore, be it resolved that the Medford City Council discuss the adoption of a commercial vacancy tax that can be applied to disincentivize these storefront properties from remaining unoccupied indefinitely.

22
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:11,204
Be it further resolved that this matter be referred to committee for further discussion with the chief assessor, finance director, and economic development director.

23
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:14,120
Yes, thank you.

24
00:01:15,581 --> 00:01:38,637
So this here is a draft of a home rule petition which would allow us the authority to, which would allow the city of Medford the authority to actually impose the commercial vacancy tax on landlords that own vacant commercial storefront properties.

25
00:01:38,777 --> 00:01:44,900
businesses or businesses that are effectively closed all the time.

26
00:01:45,580 --> 00:02:02,767
When I was going door-to-door campaigning, I ran into people who talked about the fact that in West Medford and South Medford, there are a lot of businesses that don't, that are just a lot of buildings that are owned by landlords who just never

27
00:02:03,507 --> 00:02:06,428
rent them out to businesses.

28
00:02:06,469 --> 00:02:17,794
There was one woman who was trying to get in contact with the owner of the dry cleaner that was closed at the time in West Medford for about a year and a half.

29
00:02:17,834 --> 00:02:23,217
She said that this person wouldn't even pick up the phone to talk to her.

30
00:02:23,257 --> 00:02:29,520
She wanted to open up a gym there, but that's obviously difficult to do if you can't even talk to the person who owns the building.

31
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:35,161
So there's, I did research on this.

32
00:02:35,341 --> 00:02:43,083
There's not a whole lot of default authorities that cities have to leverage this sort of attacks.

33
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:47,363
So what I've been doing is two different things.

34
00:02:47,864 --> 00:02:51,764
The first is the home rule petition draft that is in this agenda packet.

35
00:02:52,164 --> 00:02:59,306
And this would just give us the very basic legal authority to be able to enact attacks such that it would

36
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:05,088
B, it would effectively disincentivize property owners from doing this.

37
00:03:05,128 --> 00:03:07,629
And there are a few specifics in here.

38
00:03:07,749 --> 00:03:28,037
First off, it says that the proceeds from the tax will be put into a special fund that will help to aid in the repair upkeep of these properties, as well as funding local mechanisms to incurrent tenant occupancies, such as advertising for these properties and so on and so forth.

39
00:03:28,997 --> 00:03:41,942
Sometimes, and this gets into the fact that sometimes these properties are vacant for reasons that are outside of the property owner's control.

40
00:03:42,082 --> 00:03:53,547
Maybe the building is not in good enough shape to attract a tenant at all, so they would need extra funds to repair the building.

41
00:03:54,327 --> 00:03:54,848
and such.

42
00:03:55,248 --> 00:04:15,202
There's also another clause in here that specifically would enable landlords who own the property to terminate the tenancy of any business that currently has a lease with them but it's just not doing anything with that and this was because a specific

43
00:04:16,062 --> 00:04:31,056
scenario is brought to my attention where the tax would be the tax in this place would be placed on the owner of the property but sometimes they may have a lease in which the person who they may have a lease with a business owner who

44
00:04:33,118 --> 00:04:39,983
it's really in their authority to make sure that they're actually running a business day-to-day in that case.

45
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:52,951
What I've also been doing, so this here is just meant to ask the state to give Medford permission to be able to enact this vacancy tax.

46
00:04:53,632 --> 00:04:58,815
This obviously isn't the entire ordinance, so we just give the basic legal authority to do so.

47
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:01,197
If and when the state

48
00:05:02,017 --> 00:05:09,403
does give permission to Medford to enact such a tax, there would obviously be other rules that are put in place.

49
00:05:09,443 --> 00:05:16,448
For instance, a tax wouldn't be applied immediately after vacancy starts, there would be a grace period, there would just be other

50
00:05:21,531 --> 00:05:39,938
that are put in place to make sure that these scenarios I've heard about where, you know, you're not just unfairly penalizing people who may be in a situation where tenants are just not, where tenants are just not trying to rent out good businesses and their properties and so on.

51
00:05:39,978 --> 00:05:45,140
But this, again, this is just about giving the city the basic legal authority to do that simultaneously.

52
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,541
And this is,

53
00:05:47,361 --> 00:05:47,461
Um.

54
00:05:47,481 --> 00:05:54,664
Relate this is related to this initiative, but I figured it would be it would best go into zoning.

55
00:05:54,924 --> 00:06:03,607
Um I've also put in work around a vacant building ordinance, which is something that the city currently does have the authority to do.

56
00:06:03,627 --> 00:06:06,148
Um there's it's similar.

57
00:06:06,388 --> 00:06:09,489
They have had similar initiatives over in East Hampton and some other

58
00:06:17,088 --> 00:06:30,356
The city doesn't have the authority to levy a tax for profit, but we do have the authority to levy a fee in order to make something cost neutral.

59
00:06:31,717 --> 00:06:36,539
So the vacant building ordinance that East Hampton implemented basically

60
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:53,745
would charge the owners of vacant buildings, something like $1,000 a year to as long as long as the buildings are buildings are vacant to maintain a public vacant building database which would be maintained by staff members and so.

61
00:06:54,545 --> 00:07:01,315
You'd only be allowed to charge enough for that to pay for the staff cost of maintaining that.

62
00:07:01,415 --> 00:07:10,447
So, again, that is one initiative that we're looking into, and that would likely create the foundation to enact commercial vacancy tax.

63
00:07:11,488 --> 00:07:19,212
in Medford, if and when this particular petition is approved, if this council does end up passing it.

64
00:07:19,613 --> 00:07:31,839
But overall, this is my effort to address a problem that I heard about from residents time and time again, which is they don't like to see so many closed down storefronts in

65
00:07:32,499 --> 00:07:33,140
Medford.

66
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:51,294
They think that the issue is sometimes, not in all cases, but sometimes landlords that just for whatever reason either don't want to or don't have the funds to be able to rent out their storefronts that they own to

67
00:07:53,095 --> 00:08:05,260
businesses and so this is an effort to help give them to help build up the funds to either help advertise for tenants or repair their properties as it may be.

68
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,781
So the only change I would

69
00:08:10,196 --> 00:08:15,319
I personally suggest the text the clerk pointed out that typically homeworld petitions don't have the word resolved.

70
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:20,783
They have the word enacted there so I would motion to change that.

71
00:08:22,424 --> 00:08:29,149
After we hear comment from both the economic development director who I can.

72
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:34,593
see us on Zoom, as well as any members of the public who are interested in seeing this.

73
00:08:34,693 --> 00:08:46,763
I would personally like to refer it to the regular council meeting, but I also look forward to hearing what my colleagues have to say about it as well.

74
00:08:47,364 --> 00:08:48,384
So, thank you.

75
00:08:48,785 --> 00:08:49,305
Thank you.

76
00:08:49,385 --> 00:08:54,329
We have the economic development director who was invited, so I'm happy to go to him first.

77
00:08:54,349 --> 00:08:55,490
We have Sal DiStefano.

78
00:08:56,151 --> 00:08:57,172
Sal, I see you're in your car.

79
00:08:58,444 --> 00:08:59,905
It's a good time to chat.

80
00:09:03,647 --> 00:09:04,127
We can't hear you.

81
00:09:04,167 --> 00:09:05,228
I just asked you to unmute.

82
00:09:05,288 --> 00:09:06,748
You're going to have to click a button.

83
00:09:07,469 --> 00:09:08,349
Got it.

84
00:09:08,609 --> 00:09:09,410
Sorry about that.

85
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:12,631
I just had to pick up my son from soccer tryout.

86
00:09:12,772 --> 00:09:16,093
So I'm glad to join everybody.

87
00:09:17,054 --> 00:09:19,735
Thank you, Mr. President, members of the council.

88
00:09:21,376 --> 00:09:22,917
I wanted to inform

89
00:09:23,537 --> 00:09:47,173
uh everybody that we just recently submitted an application for the vacant storefront program um that's offered through the commonwealth of massachusetts on june 20th our application uh will be in front of the economic advisory coordinating council of the commonwealth

90
00:09:48,033 --> 00:10:02,543
And we're really excited about this program because basically it will provide matching grants to businesses that will move into vacant storefronts in Medford.

91
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:07,886
So I launched this program in Gloucester two years ago.

92
00:10:07,906 --> 00:10:21,335
And the reason why I like this program is the money actually goes to the business owner that is going to occupy the storefront.

93
00:10:22,295 --> 00:10:29,000
And the matching funds from the city will be from our community development block grant.

94
00:10:30,211 --> 00:10:36,913
And what the state offers are up to $20,000 in refundable tax credits.

95
00:10:37,533 --> 00:10:45,156
And why that's important is lots of times new businesses don't make a lot of profit their first year.

96
00:10:45,596 --> 00:10:55,339
So refundable tax credits work in such a way where whatever you don't owe to the state at the end of the year comes back to you in the form of a check.

97
00:10:56,559 --> 00:10:59,240
So it could mean up to,

98
00:11:02,021 --> 00:11:06,883
$20,000 for two businesses a year to start out with.

99
00:11:06,903 --> 00:11:13,126
And it's a nice incentive for the businesses to help them get started.

100
00:11:13,286 --> 00:11:18,768
In addition to that, we hope to get our facade improvement program refunded.

101
00:11:19,808 --> 00:11:25,031
So there could be a lot of resources offered to a small business and

102
00:11:25,991 --> 00:11:48,714
You know, personally, while I definitely agree with Councilor Lemming about the issue and challenges with vacancies, I just, in my professional opinion, I think, you know, like all things we do when we're talking about policy, is we have to be careful of unintended consequences.

103
00:11:49,495 --> 00:12:02,603
And those unintended consequences could be, you know, landlords taking the first person that comes along, that might not be a business that we want in Medford, just to fill a storefront.

104
00:12:02,623 --> 00:12:16,231
Or punishing a small, like a Ma and Pa landlord that has an issue with filling a vacancy because they can't afford to fix up the storefront, whatever it is.

105
00:12:17,531 --> 00:12:40,679
I just want all of us to keep that in mind because we definitely want back for our city.

106
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:45,080
The mayor and I will present on June 20th to the EACC.

107
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,361
We hope to get their approval.

108
00:12:48,106 --> 00:12:50,290
So we just lost you for about 30 seconds.

109
00:12:52,613 --> 00:12:55,899
Okay, let me, I'm pulling over.

110
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:56,640
Can you hear me now?

111
00:12:57,962 --> 00:12:59,665
We can, it sounds good now.

112
00:13:01,795 --> 00:13:02,816
Okay, sorry about that.

113
00:13:03,496 --> 00:13:10,360
So, you know, in summary, we're looking forward to this grant program to be approved by the state.

114
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:30,271
And I really think, you know, whatever policy we come forward with, we just need to keep in mind the unintended consequences that could occur, such as, you know, landlords taking, you know, the first business that comes along and it might not be something that we want.

115
00:13:30,991 --> 00:13:55,938
uh... in the city and then also i'm fortunate let me uh... as i was told uh... it as soon as i started here in medford that unfortunately there is this this narrative that's out there on where medford is a is a difficult place to to do business uh... which we're all working together to to try to uh... prove are wrong and

116
00:13:57,899 --> 00:14:22,284
just overall my concern is when things come forward that appear to be not friendly to businesses or could potentially negatively impact a business or a property owner, it just, you know, it makes it harder for us to kind of change that narrative for the city.

117
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:29,546
But with that being said, happy to work with all of you in trying to fill these vacancies.

118
00:14:30,527 --> 00:14:37,869
Jess Martinez in my office has been taking pictures of vacancies.

119
00:14:38,049 --> 00:14:45,172
They're on our list and we're happy to work with landlords and refer potential businesses to them.

120
00:14:46,012 --> 00:14:51,154
So looking forward to positive progress and I thank you for your time.

121
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:53,710
Thank you, Mr. DeStefano.

122
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:56,172
Any further questions or comments by members of the council?

123
00:14:57,373 --> 00:14:58,134
Councillor Sang.

124
00:15:00,156 --> 00:15:03,538
I'll yield to Councillor Lemming first, but I do have some questions.

125
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:05,160
Councillor Lemming, then Councillor Sang.

126
00:15:05,694 --> 00:15:12,259
So I do respect the sentiment that things like this can have unintended consequences.

127
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:26,912
Again, like I said, the Home Rule petition itself would only give the city the very basic legal authority to be able to rent, to be able to enact this tax to begin with.

128
00:15:26,972 --> 00:15:29,634
It says nothing about timelines post vacancy to

129
00:15:32,456 --> 00:15:46,856
uh after which the tax would apply um so the idea behind this would be if the state does grant us the authority to do this it would be just one uh it it would

130
00:15:47,637 --> 00:16:00,007
Hopefully the ordinance would be able to be crafted so that it makes it so that these negative consequences would be very practically disincentivized in the actual implementation.

131
00:16:00,908 --> 00:16:12,357
Some other concerns that I did have though is that I went to a meeting very recently where a developer just outright told me that keeping some of the properties that he owned

132
00:16:12,797 --> 00:16:20,322
vacant was actually profitable for him because it would make a tax, it would make, he could just write off, write it off as a loss in his taxes.

133
00:16:20,382 --> 00:16:31,149
So sometimes it is beneficial to landlords, it is in their best interest to keep these properties vacant and that is

134
00:16:31,849 --> 00:16:38,434
really that is really one factor that this is meant to disincentivize.

135
00:16:38,634 --> 00:16:42,316
I do look forward to seeing how that grant application goes.

136
00:16:42,497 --> 00:16:53,925
Obviously there is no one tool that the city has that will be able to fix the problem that we've been experiencing for a long time, which is vacant storefronts, but

137
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:59,208
a combination of carrots and sticks are needed to be able to address this problem.

138
00:16:59,928 --> 00:17:20,660
And like I also said, the idea behind this is that the funds would go, is that the revenue from this tax would go into a fund specifically meant to help out those vacant storefronts when they do, if they are in a state in which they can't be rented out.

139
00:17:22,421 --> 00:17:38,328
Again, like, like, 11 thing that some members of the Chamber of Commerce told me about that dry cleaner over in West Medford is that there's very significant repairs that need to be made to it to be before it can be rented out on the tune of.

140
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:45,543
I think 70, don't hold me to it, but I think it said something like $70,000 worth of repairs at the time needed to be made.

141
00:17:45,603 --> 00:17:48,265
And I don't know where that money would come from.

142
00:17:48,285 --> 00:17:57,049
So the idea behind this is to be able to collect some fund, which is specifically meant to address those issues.

143
00:17:57,309 --> 00:18:06,734
But I do respect the views and the efforts of our economic development director, but it is my belief that

144
00:18:07,645 --> 00:18:14,668
multiple tools and initiatives are needed to help to address this problem.

145
00:18:14,868 --> 00:18:15,268
Thank you.

146
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:19,830
I think in general, I'm open to this idea.

147
00:18:21,651 --> 00:18:28,114
I have questions about it, and I think a lot of it is, a lot of my support will hinge on the details of the proposal.

148
00:18:28,134 --> 00:18:30,675
I think my first question is to Councillor Fleming.

149
00:18:30,735 --> 00:18:32,435
Am I understanding it correctly that

150
00:18:34,136 --> 00:18:42,785
doing this process is a necessary first step for us to have a conversation about the details of what a vacancy tax would look like.

151
00:18:42,845 --> 00:18:52,035
So in terms of like, we need to do this first before we can meet as a council to talk about what percentage or what, you know, what the fee is and what the exemptions are.

152
00:18:54,797 --> 00:18:55,338
Absolutely.

153
00:18:55,398 --> 00:19:01,965
So, often homeworld petitions are written in very simple, short, plain language.

154
00:19:02,465 --> 00:19:09,373
Essentially, this would just give the city permission in the 1st place to be able to then implement an ordinance.

155
00:19:09,613 --> 00:19:11,535
So my view, my view on this is.

156
00:19:12,096 --> 00:19:18,200
we will go to the state, ask them for permission to be able to just have the right to do this in the first place.

157
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:30,508
This text obviously is not detailed enough to act as an ordinance or a set of rules in itself, but it would grant the legal authority to then be able to implement that.

158
00:19:32,989 --> 00:19:37,892
As I said, there are initiatives in other cities right now.

159
00:19:38,692 --> 00:19:41,534
They've basically been doing the same thing.

160
00:19:41,754 --> 00:19:53,760
In East Hampton, they've implemented a vacant building ordinance, which effectively lets them tax owners of vacant buildings at certain very small rates just to maintain a database.

161
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:59,743
Again, my concern with that is that that's not really enough to justify

162
00:20:02,104 --> 00:20:05,926
to justify a tax write-off.

163
00:20:06,126 --> 00:20:24,133
So I think what would happen if we did that is that it would incentivize some owners of these properties to, if we just had a vacant building ordinance, it would incentivize some owners of these properties to rent out, but other owners, it would just, you know,

164
00:20:24,893 --> 00:20:29,196
it would basically just be another number on a spreadsheet that they could account for.

165
00:20:29,336 --> 00:20:37,861
So this essentially would allow us to levy a tax that would be enough to disincentivize them from doing that.

166
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:57,153
I think it's, if I can, in summary, I think it's, it is helpful to know that, you know, even if I don't necessarily agree with all of the details of a proposed tax in the future, even if we disagree on the viewpoint, a vote tonight is just to give us tools in the toolbox to consider.

167
00:20:57,173 --> 00:21:04,198
I do have some of the same worries that the economic development director has about this proposal.

168
00:21:04,218 --> 00:21:07,401
I do actually have, you know,

169
00:21:08,021 --> 00:21:09,542
questions that are more detailed about those.

170
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:14,123
And I think if I can, I'll direct them through the chair to the economic development director.

171
00:21:15,444 --> 00:21:23,927
I also agree with Councilor Levin that we need to be exploring both sticks and carrots in this situation, expanding the tools that we have.

172
00:21:25,587 --> 00:21:27,888
I hear, I am, you know,

173
00:21:28,937 --> 00:21:38,482
the idea that we, the landlord might seek the first person to fill that sore front is a concern I have in my mind.

174
00:21:40,623 --> 00:21:43,624
I'm curious if that's something we can mitigate through the zoning process.

175
00:21:44,164 --> 00:21:50,947
So making sure that we are not allowing for certain uses that we don't want in our business districts.

176
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:55,810
Is the economic development director able to speak to that?

177
00:22:00,973 --> 00:22:01,973
Yes, great, thank you.

178
00:22:03,254 --> 00:22:10,818
So the answer is, it depends, right there, you know, it depends on the location in if the particular use is.

179
00:22:13,735 --> 00:22:19,559
you know, um, is as of right, um, or requires a special permit.

180
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:25,583
Um, I, I think that, and I think some business uses might be subjective.

181
00:22:26,464 --> 00:22:28,725
Um, you know, personally, I, I, um,

182
00:22:30,762 --> 00:22:37,987
You know, if something is a check cashing place, not something that looks good for a district.

183
00:22:38,047 --> 00:22:41,429
I'll probably get hate email after this meeting on it.

184
00:22:41,489 --> 00:22:45,311
But, you know, other types of uses.

185
00:22:46,792 --> 00:22:49,436
You know, they could be allowed, but just not desirable.

186
00:22:49,877 --> 00:23:00,133
Or it could be, you know, a prospective tenant that isn't really financially sound that they might just take.

187
00:23:02,456 --> 00:23:19,084
With that being said, I think going back to the vacant storefront district program, now that we have a list of those vacancies, I would like to follow up with the landlords and basically

188
00:23:20,985 --> 00:23:44,899
when possible get some feedback as to why it's vacant and maybe if there's something where let's say that the space is uninhabitable because of the cost of like you had talked about the example of the dry cleaner you know if if something is kind of an insurmountable reason that that may be

189
00:23:45,859 --> 00:24:08,933
we work with them and say okay you know let let's try to figure out a solution here and you know versus somebody who's a bad actor right like maybe there's a way to differentiate the two but definitely happy to work with council uh on this and um uh everybody's been very helpful to me ever since i got here so i definitely think we can

190
00:24:09,932 --> 00:24:12,977
We can be in touch with each other as this process goes on.

191
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:21,833
Hopefully the grant program will be approved and we can work together to help resolve the situation.

192
00:24:24,037 --> 00:24:24,738
Thank you, Director.

193
00:24:24,758 --> 00:24:26,038
Councillor Sainte.

194
00:24:26,199 --> 00:24:43,969
I think the director's comments lead me to the next question is, you know, even if we have worries about unintended consequences with this, with the proposed new system, I think it's clear that one of the unintended consequences of the current system is, is landlords keeping their properties vacant, storefronts vacant.

195
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:51,315
for tax write-off purposes, and I think we would all agree that that's an unintended consequence.

196
00:24:51,875 --> 00:25:01,222
And so I do see this as a potential way to address that by changing costs and addressing negative externalities.

197
00:25:02,363 --> 00:25:11,830
I'm curious what the director would have to say to other policy tools that we might use to address that problem of

198
00:25:12,731 --> 00:25:16,446
landlords keeping their storefronts vacant for tax write-off purposes.

199
00:25:19,102 --> 00:25:30,407
Um, I think, uh, counselor that, so I'm going to say that this is the first time I've heard that there's tax advantages to property owners for keeping it vacant.

200
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:43,012
My understanding that as somebody who owns, um, property myself that I rent out, um, that it just, you don't make you report less income at the end of the year.

201
00:25:43,032 --> 00:25:44,872
That is not a write off.

202
00:25:45,213 --> 00:25:46,033
I could be wrong.

203
00:25:46,073 --> 00:25:47,173
I'm not a CPA.

204
00:25:47,954 --> 00:25:48,094
Um,

205
00:25:49,094 --> 00:26:09,824
But with that being said, I think sometimes also the free market could solve the issue by new owners coming in and investing in the property and getting them tenanted.

206
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:13,905
But I think a lot of it has to do with

207
00:26:15,186 --> 00:26:27,330
outreach and relationships and just do whatever we can to direct new businesses to vacant storefronts and, you know, trying to get those filled.

208
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:39,795
And if there are bad actors out there, which every city has them, you know, then we, you know, maybe a measure like this could help resolve the situation.

209
00:26:39,815 --> 00:26:42,336
Thank you.

210
00:26:42,456 --> 00:26:43,056
Councilor Zaro.

211
00:26:45,009 --> 00:27:05,160
I was going to say something similar to what the director just said, which is that if there is a tax benefit to keeping storefronts vacant, I think that we should verify that with a tax professional before moving forward.

212
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:06,841
If that means

213
00:27:07,765 --> 00:27:11,529
before moving forward with writing the basic first step home rule petition.

214
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:20,058
I'm not sure if we need to do that before then or after when we're deciding if we want to pass this and then decide later as we're writing it.

215
00:27:21,179 --> 00:27:23,601
I'm not sure that exists either.

216
00:27:23,621 --> 00:27:27,866
Correct me if I'm wrong, but

217
00:27:29,045 --> 00:27:53,284
One, the second thing is, I wonder if some portion of this is sort of a, you can't squeeze blood from a stone situation, and that some of the storefronts might be vacant because of what was mentioned earlier, that there's some insurmountable amount of, you know, the building's not up to code and they can't afford to bring it up to code.

218
00:27:53,823 --> 00:28:04,973
and therefore it can't be rented out because the owners of the property are unable to reach enforcement levels of, you know, eliminate the violations.

219
00:28:05,533 --> 00:28:12,820
So I'm not sure how, I'm not sure we as a council are at the level of understanding.

220
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:20,847
I don't feel myself that I'm at the level of understanding of the nuances of the situation yet, but also that being said,

221
00:28:22,628 --> 00:28:37,736
I could be convinced that this process, all that we need to do is have a basic understanding of the problem and that we are looking for approval from the state to begin greater understanding.

222
00:28:37,796 --> 00:28:48,101
Though I would personally feel more comfortable if we had more details and more data to back up how this would benefit us in filling this reference, particularly

223
00:28:48,968 --> 00:28:55,450
in my neighborhood in West Bedford Square that has a bunch of empty storefronts right now, which is unappealing.

224
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:57,351
So I do understand the need for this.

225
00:28:57,411 --> 00:28:58,731
I agree that there is a need for it.

226
00:28:59,391 --> 00:29:11,775
And I'm not sure that I can point to, like, add a spreadsheet or presentation that would make me see more clearly that this is the solution that's going to get us there.

227
00:29:12,236 --> 00:29:13,236
I would feel more comfortable.

228
00:29:15,353 --> 00:29:15,973
Thank you.

229
00:29:16,773 --> 00:29:19,494
Councilor Collins, Vice President Collins, Councilor Lemming.

230
00:29:20,895 --> 00:29:21,175
Thank you.

231
00:29:21,215 --> 00:29:23,655
Councilor Lemming had his hand up first, if that was a direct response.

232
00:29:23,796 --> 00:29:24,836
Yeah, but he's talked a lot.

233
00:29:25,016 --> 00:29:25,796
I'm owning you.

234
00:29:25,856 --> 00:29:25,936
OK.

235
00:29:27,076 --> 00:29:27,337
Thank you.

236
00:29:29,997 --> 00:29:34,399
Appreciate this introductory conversation on this topic.

237
00:29:34,459 --> 00:29:34,899
I'm sorry.

238
00:29:35,099 --> 00:29:35,819
I arrived a little late.

239
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:39,000
I was coming from a work meeting, so there might have been some details that I missed at the beginning.

240
00:29:44,002 --> 00:29:45,625
It's a bad sound system.

241
00:29:45,785 --> 00:29:46,786
Let's be careful.

242
00:29:47,187 --> 00:29:49,851
Let's be careful we don't get misheard.

243
00:29:53,422 --> 00:30:06,569
I think I'm feeling similarly to some of my fellow counselors and that I have a number of questions on kind of where this proposal is coming from that I would like to get some answers to before we move forward.

244
00:30:07,649 --> 00:30:14,172
I think that's certainly the impetus for having this kind of broader conversation about what to do about vacant storefronts is really important.

245
00:30:14,212 --> 00:30:21,776
And my preference would be to continue this conversation kind of in a broader context of what in general are we doing about vacant storefronts.

246
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:22,827
I think for me.

247
00:30:24,352 --> 00:30:33,456
I would like to take the time for myself to have a little bit more context of how do we quantify how many vacant storefronts are in the city?

248
00:30:33,496 --> 00:30:34,337
What type are they?

249
00:30:34,437 --> 00:30:35,157
Where are they?

250
00:30:35,237 --> 00:30:38,578
Is there any trends in terms of ownership or type or neighborhood?

251
00:30:39,019 --> 00:30:43,301
Is this a thing that cities typically mention by number or by density or percentage?

252
00:30:44,001 --> 00:30:46,062
How long do they tend to be vacant for?

253
00:30:46,082 --> 00:30:51,144
I think I'd like to enhance my understanding about what exactly the problem is.

254
00:30:53,465 --> 00:31:02,737
And I also would love to get an expert opinion or an expert analysis of the tax incentive that we've heard of that there is to remain vacant.

255
00:31:02,797 --> 00:31:04,820
I would love to get some more details about that.

256
00:31:07,779 --> 00:31:20,268
I think where I'm landing is that, you know, we know that vacant storefronts are an issue in the community because when we have them, people talk about it and people don't like seeing vacant storefronts where there ought to be interesting or useful businesses.

257
00:31:21,809 --> 00:31:34,318
But I agree that there are some, I have some concerns about the unintended consequences because another thing that we hear about is when people come to counselors and they say, why is it that we have five X style businesses in Medford Square and no,

258
00:31:35,699 --> 00:31:37,981
there isn't a third bar or something like that.

259
00:31:38,061 --> 00:31:39,641
And we have to say, well, it's not up to us.

260
00:31:39,781 --> 00:31:47,886
But I think that the issue of why don't our squares have the character that we might want for them is a question that we should consider alongside this.

261
00:31:48,606 --> 00:32:03,194
In terms of what we're kind of doing here in general with the issue of vacant storefronts, I would really like to have a conversation about what, I'd like to continue the conversation that the director started about what really helps

262
00:32:05,512 --> 00:32:19,003
when it comes to the business community with filling vacant storefronts, figuring out what business owners need, and kind of assessing where is this mechanism kind of our list of most useful tactics and priorities?

263
00:32:20,103 --> 00:32:24,107
And also assessing, you know, when's the right moment for something like this?

264
00:32:24,907 --> 00:32:28,890
Um, is this on our list of top five things to do to get storefronts filled?

265
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:50,425
Um, or should we be investigating, you know, kind of, or should we be fast tracking, um, you know, some other measures, um, you know, and continuing to prioritize the conversation of how do we as a council support getting storefronts filled, um, but perhaps spend some more time with this home rule petition and put this forward as part of a more, uh,

266
00:32:51,493 --> 00:32:53,034
coordinated strategy.

267
00:32:53,054 --> 00:33:09,405
I'm also curious to know, and I apologize, Councilor Lemming, if you spoke to this earlier, if there's any sort of groundswell of cities passing this type of home rule petition, if we're kind of in that moment of motion on it, or if this is more of a gradual coming together.

268
00:33:11,729 --> 00:33:18,495
because I think in general, I think the director's point is well taken that we have to consider not just what this would potentially do, but how it will be perceived.

269
00:33:19,576 --> 00:33:32,127
And I do think it would be advantageous for us to put this forward in the context of more measures or at least underlying measures that the city is already doing, because I am concerned about it.

270
00:33:32,908 --> 00:33:36,331
I'm concerned about how it will be perceived if we put it forward in kind of a conversational vacuum.

271
00:33:36,351 --> 00:33:37,392
Thank you.

272
00:33:42,480 --> 00:34:00,886
So, to address a couple of the points first off the city does not have a good handle on the number of vacant storefronts I talked to the building commissioner he had a part part of this just has to do with capacity and this was our conversations about the vacant bill about the vacant building ordinance that I also passed to zoning.

273
00:34:02,486 --> 00:34:13,577
They had a spreadsheet that had been last updated, I think, in 2015, but I don't think that they actually had the capacity to be able to figure it out and therefore get a handle on the problem.

274
00:34:13,597 --> 00:34:16,600
Another pattern in this

275
00:34:18,722 --> 00:34:44,062
in this conversation is, so I understand that there are unintended consequences, but there are things that I think would be more appropriate to solve using other means, like as Councilor Sang was saying, I think it is more appropriate to worry about, to handle the idea of store of businesses that we don't want being in places we don't want with zoning rather than something like this.

276
00:34:44,122 --> 00:34:45,744
This really is meant to address the,

277
00:34:46,444 --> 00:34:50,447
the small number of bad apples in the city.

278
00:34:51,387 --> 00:35:05,235
The tax incentive comment actually came from a developer that I was in a meeting with where the conversation was something like, I was talking about this initiative more at a high level way.

279
00:35:05,295 --> 00:35:09,798
I said, listen, there's a lot of vacant properties.

280
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:16,482
I'm developing a commercial vacancy tax initiative around that.

281
00:35:17,102 --> 00:35:28,730
And the response from the developer was something like, Oh, well, I actually want to keep a few of my properties vacant because then I could just write that off as a loss on my taxes.

282
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:30,672
And it's more beneficial for me.

283
00:35:30,732 --> 00:35:32,513
You don't really understand how this works.

284
00:35:32,553 --> 00:35:33,974
And it was sort of phrase like that.

285
00:35:34,494 --> 00:35:39,978
So that was and saying that saying something like that to a public official where

286
00:35:40,738 --> 00:35:47,902
It's not in the public interest at all to have someone that owns these properties deliberately try to keep them empty.

287
00:35:48,922 --> 00:36:00,008
So I think that we could definitely look into the specific tax rules that enable this to happen.

288
00:36:00,768 --> 00:36:16,447
But in regards to all the details of implementation and so on that we've been talking about, again, Home Rule petition step of this, if it is approved, would just allow the city to have the basic tools it needs.

289
00:36:20,091 --> 00:36:22,754
to be able to craft an ordinance like this in the first place.

290
00:36:22,794 --> 00:36:30,783
So when we're at the, as Councilor Lozaro was saying, we do not need to have every single detail of this figured out at this stage.

291
00:36:31,304 --> 00:36:34,187
Hypothetically, I'm not saying we should do this, we could

292
00:36:35,729 --> 00:36:59,195
we could we could even submit a home rule petition it gets approved we find out it's really not what the city needs maybe the uh grant that the economic development director uh submitting goes through and you know we find out that that really does address the problem and then down the line we find out we don't need it but at the same time we could also run into a situation where the grant doesn't go through or it just

293
00:36:59,915 --> 00:37:04,639
doesn't work and we actually do really need this tool in the toolbox if we're going to do something about that.

294
00:37:04,979 --> 00:37:18,349
And in that case, it really would be useful to have a home rule petition submitted sooner rather than later so that several years from now we could potentially have something like this in our toolbox.

295
00:37:18,549 --> 00:37:28,016
So, you know, I don't want with something like this, I do understand that there is, as Council Vice President Collins was hinting at, there is a

296
00:37:28,997 --> 00:37:39,005
There definitely is an optic situation where submitting something like this can send a message to business owners and property owners through the city.

297
00:37:39,386 --> 00:37:48,133
But I also, at the same time, I don't want to get into analysis paralysis when this is really just the step 1 in the process.

298
00:37:50,387 --> 00:37:54,171
I think you said it best when you said we don't have to have all the details at this time.

299
00:37:54,731 --> 00:38:05,180
And I think we actually don't behoove ourselves to discuss the details of the ordinance that we would potentially be able to pass before we have the power to do it.

300
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:09,543
And I think we get caught up in those discussions and it actually confuses the process.

301
00:38:09,944 --> 00:38:13,587
I was going to say that like 20 minutes ago, but I kind of already let it go.

302
00:38:15,248 --> 00:38:17,970
So I decided to let it go more, which maybe wasn't the best choice.

303
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:21,794
But in any case, I just want to say three things.

304
00:38:21,834 --> 00:38:24,896
Number one, one of the issues here is local control.

305
00:38:25,377 --> 00:38:32,362
I generally think that it's better for the city of Benford to have more authority than less authority and to have an additional tool in the toolbox.

306
00:38:33,023 --> 00:38:36,126
So in that sense, I think there's validity here.

307
00:38:36,986 --> 00:38:38,167
My second piece is on

308
00:38:39,208 --> 00:38:40,329
legal review.

309
00:38:40,949 --> 00:38:50,396
In addition to the other potential motions discussed, I believe by Vice President Collins, there'll be a motion to keep it in committee and have further discussion generally on the commercial vacancy issue.

310
00:38:50,456 --> 00:38:54,498
I'd also like to see the text of the draft Home Rule petition reviewed by legal counsel.

311
00:38:55,299 --> 00:38:57,920
My third issue is just generally what we're trying to solve for here.

312
00:38:57,940 --> 00:39:01,603
I think we all know that, you know,

313
00:39:02,659 --> 00:39:09,663
good economics shows that good, fair, and free markets are markets with good regulation.

314
00:39:10,543 --> 00:39:15,246
One of the things we're trying to correct for here is regulations outside of our control.

315
00:39:15,306 --> 00:39:20,468
There are tax incentives at the federal level that have perverse incentives and create perverse incentives.

316
00:39:20,508 --> 00:39:21,509
There are externalities

317
00:39:22,429 --> 00:39:24,671
that the regulatory system doesn't account for.

318
00:39:25,452 --> 00:39:45,446
And as someone, I think Sal noted, a lot of this is about relationships and network theory tends to throw microeconomics 101, as Friedman would say, into disarray very quickly because you have relationships and actually the personal making a big impact here.

319
00:39:45,546 --> 00:39:46,727
Or you may have an individual

320
00:39:47,567 --> 00:39:53,310
who has a certain portfolio where it makes sense to keep something vacant, where you may have an individual with a portfolio where it doesn't.

321
00:39:53,770 --> 00:40:01,474
And that's where the idea, the very clean but very unrealistic idea of the uniform rational actor tends to fall apart.

322
00:40:02,614 --> 00:40:12,899
So just putting that out there, I do agree that obviously the regulations at the multiple levels of government that impact commercial vacancy clearly are out of whack.

323
00:40:13,539 --> 00:40:18,042
I tend to agree that having more tools at the municipal level to try to align them is a good thing.

324
00:40:18,682 --> 00:40:22,124
And this might well be one, but I think we have to have more discussion about that.

325
00:40:22,204 --> 00:40:32,049
So I would request, in addition to the motion I think Vice President Collins was intending to propose, that we also refer this to draft home rule petition to legal counsel.

326
00:40:32,149 --> 00:40:39,674
But just as one person in general, my opinion is that getting more home rule power from the state is a good thing.

327
00:40:40,694 --> 00:40:41,595
And this could

328
00:40:42,355 --> 00:40:46,118
be a good tool in the scope of trying to address this problem.

329
00:40:47,518 --> 00:40:49,400
So with that, is there a motion on the floor?

330
00:40:52,502 --> 00:40:53,142
Vice President Collins.

331
00:40:55,043 --> 00:41:03,489
I would motion to keep the paper in committee and to submit the draft of the formal petition for legal review.

332
00:41:04,209 --> 00:41:05,230
And I think I missed a part of that.

333
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:08,312
So somebody jump in if I'm forgetting.

334
00:41:29,113 --> 00:41:31,034
On that motion, is there any discussion by members of the public?

335
00:41:32,595 --> 00:41:33,876
We have a second from Councilor Zaro.

336
00:41:34,697 --> 00:41:35,838
Any discussion by members of the public?

337
00:41:36,678 --> 00:41:38,420
Mr. Fiore, name and address for the record, please.

338
00:41:39,661 --> 00:41:40,361
You have three minutes.

339
00:41:40,401 --> 00:41:41,282
We're running up on the clock.

340
00:41:42,383 --> 00:41:42,523
Yes.

341
00:42:14,915 --> 00:42:16,535
Sorry, you can start the three minutes again.

342
00:42:16,555 --> 00:42:17,216
My apologies.

343
00:42:44,414 --> 00:42:45,074
Do I have three minutes?

344
00:42:45,094 --> 00:42:47,015
You have three minutes starting now, yeah, sorry.

345
00:42:47,155 --> 00:42:49,055
Okay, so you have simply stated a what.

346
00:42:49,976 --> 00:42:52,176
Metford has some vacant commercial properties.

347
00:42:52,296 --> 00:42:54,397
However, you haven't determined the why.

348
00:42:55,117 --> 00:42:58,178
Why does Metford have some vacant commercial properties?

349
00:42:58,578 --> 00:43:04,100
How could you possibly hope to solve something if you don't know the why something is happening?

350
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:07,081
Let me restate the situation now in engineering terms.

351
00:43:07,541 --> 00:43:10,522
You have simply stated a condition, situation, or problem.

352
00:43:11,022 --> 00:43:13,183
Metford has some vacant commercial properties.

353
00:43:14,278 --> 00:43:18,721
However, you haven't provided the diagnosis of vacant commercial properties.

354
00:43:18,861 --> 00:43:24,484
In other words, you haven't investigated or analyzed the cause or nature of vacant commercial properties.

355
00:43:24,765 --> 00:43:28,127
How could you possibly hope to solve the problem if you don't know the cause of the problem?

356
00:43:28,567 --> 00:43:31,209
Let me yet again restate the situation, but now in medical terms.

357
00:43:31,989 --> 00:43:34,131
You have simply stated a sign or symptom.

358
00:43:34,531 --> 00:43:36,392
Medford has some vacant commercial properties.

359
00:43:36,432 --> 00:43:39,895
However, you haven't provided a diagnosis of vacant commercial properties.

360
00:43:39,935 --> 00:43:44,618
In other words, you haven't identified the disease leading to vacant commercial properties.

361
00:43:44,698 --> 00:43:48,601
How could you possibly hope to get rid of the signs and symptoms if you don't know the disease?

362
00:43:48,981 --> 00:43:51,103
You cure the disease, not the signs and symptoms.

363
00:43:51,463 --> 00:43:57,728
So I didn't have enough time to look at this, but I did some research, which I haven't heard anything in terms of research in this meeting.

364
00:43:58,049 --> 00:44:04,214
So this is out of Erika Moskowski, Carver HBS, and Daniel Stackman at NYU Stern.

365
00:44:04,554 --> 00:44:08,437
Can retail vacancy taxes reduce urban storefront vacancies?

366
00:44:08,918 --> 00:44:11,640
And I just would like to point out that

367
00:44:13,956 --> 00:44:23,823
So the case for vacancy tax, persistently high vacancy can have significant, I'm quoting, this is a presentation that I just mentioned.

368
00:44:25,644 --> 00:44:31,368
Persistently high vacancy can have significant externalities affecting surviving tenants, residents, et cetera.

369
00:44:31,888 --> 00:44:39,113
So a vacancy tax could act as a Pigouvian tax, which would force lenders to internalize the externalities vacancy imposes.

370
00:44:39,153 --> 00:44:42,976
However, I didn't mention any of the problems with this.

371
00:44:43,596 --> 00:44:47,420
So these are the cases that this study mentions against a vacancy tax.

372
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:53,605
A vacancy is primarily caused by search frictions, so meaning it's hard for landlords or tenants to match each other.

373
00:44:54,226 --> 00:45:01,212
Tenancy covenants, which I don't know where I have done, or severe lack of demand in a vacancy tax is both ineffective and punitive.

374
00:45:01,733 --> 00:45:05,556
The tax is likely to be especially harmful in areas with low demand for retail space.

375
00:45:06,437 --> 00:45:10,480
Landlords provide a socially useful screening service which the tax may distort.

376
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:15,123
Landlords only want to sign tenants who are going to be successful, for example, generate sales.

377
00:45:15,503 --> 00:45:20,907
If a landlord doesn't think a tenant will generate enough sales to pay rent, then it's unlikely that the tenant will benefit the neighborhood.

378
00:45:21,327 --> 00:45:25,050
A tax may cause landlords to accept worse tenants than they would in the absence of a tax.

379
00:45:25,070 --> 00:45:26,110
So there's an updated

380
00:45:27,952 --> 00:45:30,393
Study to this by the same author.

381
00:45:30,413 --> 00:45:34,115
So this is Erika Moskovsky and Daniel Stackman.

382
00:45:34,295 --> 00:45:38,677
It's a working paper out of the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies in 2023.

383
00:45:39,037 --> 00:45:42,058
Why do urban storefronts stay empty for so long?

384
00:45:42,198 --> 00:45:43,839
And it basically- Yes, you have about 30 seconds.

385
00:45:43,919 --> 00:45:56,327
Yes, it basically mentions that we also find that while a vacancy tax similar to the one proposed in New York State would decrease the vacancy rate and rents, it would also lower tenant quality and lead to faster churn in the city storefronts.

386
00:45:56,687 --> 00:46:10,956
So I would, in the future, I would like to see research on an issue and state the why so we can actually address the problem rather than just blanketly say like, oh, okay, we observe empty storefronts, we're gonna tax

387
00:46:11,576 --> 00:46:14,298
We're going to propose a tax and solve the problem through taxation.

388
00:46:14,738 --> 00:46:18,941
Just to clarify, we are proposing having the power to discuss implementing a tax.

389
00:46:18,981 --> 00:46:20,242
Yeah, I understand.

390
00:46:20,322 --> 00:46:30,890
But I would, again, I would much rather if we discuss why this is happening and all sorts of specific ways to address the problem, rather than just having decided we're going to solve it through taxation.

391
00:46:31,210 --> 00:46:31,430
Great.

392
00:46:31,590 --> 00:46:34,272
And I think that is the intent of Vice President Collins' motion.

393
00:46:34,993 --> 00:46:36,554
Any further discussion by members of the public?

394
00:46:38,948 --> 00:46:45,693
Seeing none on Zoom and none in the chamber, on the motion by Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Zaro.

395
00:46:46,674 --> 00:46:47,335
All those in favor?

396
00:46:48,095 --> 00:46:48,436
Opposed?

397
00:46:48,476 --> 00:46:49,076
Motion passes.

398
00:46:49,937 --> 00:46:50,677
Any further motions?

399
00:46:51,878 --> 00:46:55,261
On the motion adjourned by Councilor Seng, seconded by Councilor Zaro.

400
00:46:55,301 --> 00:46:55,941
All those in favor?

401
00:46:56,422 --> 00:46:57,062
Opposed?

402
00:46:58,043 --> 00:47:03,948
For those on Zoom, we are moving to our Committee of the Whole meeting on the school budget, so you'll have to rejoin the next link.

403
00:47:04,668 --> 00:47:05,309
Meeting is adjourned.
