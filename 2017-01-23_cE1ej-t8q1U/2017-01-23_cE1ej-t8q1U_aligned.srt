00:00:03,018 --> 00:00:04,539
Now for this week's Mustang report.

2
00:00:43,403 --> 00:00:48,406
Hello, we're back here again with Tea Time with Dora and Haley with our second guest, Lydia.

3
00:00:48,826 --> 00:00:52,288
So Lydia, we have a few random questions to ask you.

4
00:00:52,769 --> 00:00:54,770
So what would you say your favorite movie is?

5
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,512
It's definitely Lilo and Stitch, the first one.

6
00:01:00,193 --> 00:01:01,634
We heard you're on the gymnastics team.

7
00:01:01,734 --> 00:01:02,595
How's that going for you?

8
00:01:03,075 --> 00:01:04,216
It's rough, man.

9
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:09,159
Gymnastics, I don't know if it's my calling, but I'm going to work hard for this team in this season.

10
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:11,040
And it's a great group of kids.

11
00:01:13,855 --> 00:01:15,756
If you could have any superpower, what would it be?

12
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:17,297
Oh my god, I'd be invisible.

13
00:01:18,038 --> 00:01:18,779
Or maybe I'd fly.

14
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:19,799
No, I'd definitely fly.

15
00:01:19,999 --> 00:01:20,820
That would be pretty sick.

16
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,201
Last question.

17
00:01:22,381 --> 00:01:24,843
What's your favorite season and how do you feel about the snow today?

18
00:01:25,503 --> 00:01:29,286
I love winter because I don't like being hot in the summer.

19
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:35,971
But summer is definitely my favorite season because we don't have to go to school.

20
00:01:36,251 --> 00:01:36,511
Awesome.

21
00:01:36,631 --> 00:01:37,212
There you have it.

22
00:01:37,832 --> 00:01:38,733
Thank you very much, Lydia.

23
00:02:20,365 --> 00:02:24,388
belongs on a knee.

24
00:02:25,809 --> 00:02:34,075
But I found a boy who I love more than I ever did you before.

25
00:02:34,115 --> 00:02:39,499
So stand beside the river I cry and let your

26
00:02:43,718 --> 00:02:48,801
I also, again, would like to thank superintendent Roy Belson for getting my school tomorrow.

27
00:02:48,901 --> 00:02:56,706
I thought I was going to be walking to school tomorrow with blue lips.

28
00:02:57,247 --> 00:02:58,507
Yeah, blue lips.

29
00:02:58,547 --> 00:03:03,330
You know, up next we have Alida Brenton singing Blue Lips by Regine Spector.

30
00:03:03,691 --> 00:03:05,552
Let's give her a round of applause.

31
00:03:05,612 --> 00:03:13,517
Stood up beneath the knowledge tree And they chopped it down to make my bed

32
00:03:14,697 --> 00:03:30,100
Okay, and on that note, we have Beatrice Gonsalves singing Love Yourself by Justin Bieber.

33
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:47,317
And if you think that I'm still holding on to something, you should go and love yourself.

34
00:03:47,377 --> 00:03:51,259
Cause it's tickling me.

35
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:58,624
If I were a boy, I think I could understand.

36
00:04:02,597 --> 00:04:17,956
And we miss the love of God, I swear I'd be a better man I listen to her, cause I know how it hurts

37
00:04:22,268 --> 00:04:30,732
when you lose the one you wanted, cause he's taken you for granted, and everything you had I've destroyed.

38
00:04:30,892 --> 00:04:46,319
I'd like to give it up for Raquel Darachi and Julia Mara singing two songs, The Way You're Looking Tonight by Frank Sinatra, and one of my personal favorites, If I Ain't Got You, by Alicia Keys.

39
00:04:51,597 --> 00:05:17,608
Yes, you're lovely With your smile so warm And your cheeks so soft There is nothing for me but to love Some people want it all But I don't want nothing at all If it ain't you, baby

40
00:05:18,779 --> 00:05:20,980
I got you, baby.

41
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,721
Some people want diamond rings.

42
00:05:24,182 --> 00:05:27,123
Some just want everything.

43
00:05:27,183 --> 00:05:33,886
But everything means nothing if I ain't got you.

44
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:38,869
But I remember when I moved in you.

45
00:05:39,229 --> 00:05:42,530
The holy dust was moving too.

46
00:05:42,871 --> 00:05:47,333
And every breath we drew was hallelujah.

47
00:06:09,709 --> 00:06:11,849
Tell me, what is your position here at MHS?

48
00:06:12,589 --> 00:06:13,550
I work in the main office.

49
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:14,350
I'm one of the admin

50
00:06:15,685 --> 00:06:17,626
And I work alongside Ms.

51
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:20,008
Lisa Bowler and the headmaster, Dr. Prowler.

52
00:06:20,608 --> 00:06:33,618
I like to think that both, well, the whole main office crew itself creates a welcoming and safe environment so that we try to nurture and harbor any kind of student that needs our help throughout the day.

53
00:06:34,138 --> 00:06:40,442
Obviously, these students go to their academics, to their teachers, but sometimes they just need that extra support during the day, and we always try to provide it.

54
00:06:41,143 --> 00:06:42,904
How do you come to be here at Medford High?

55
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:43,645
Why did you come back?

56
00:06:44,585 --> 00:06:51,587
So when I originally went to school, I actually went to Bridgewater State University, I went for an English degree, thinking that I wanted to teach.

57
00:06:52,347 --> 00:07:01,130
When I came here, I started studying, I kind of was in the classroom, made me a little nervous, wasn't really my thing, but knew I wanted to stay within the school, and so I kind of came and found my little niche here.

58
00:07:09,161 --> 00:07:16,446
of the directors and founders of Spotlight Productions and I'm a balloon artist so I have gone to different kinds of events and twisted balloons.

59
00:07:16,766 --> 00:07:18,567
If you could be any animal what would you be?

60
00:07:19,247 --> 00:07:20,208
I could be any animal.

61
00:07:51,325 --> 00:07:51,507
Yeah!

62
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:14,610
I'm here with Ms.

63
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:19,512
Mack and the question of the week is who do you think is going to win the Patriots game, Patriots or the Steelers?

64
00:08:19,872 --> 00:08:20,472
TV 12, baby.

65
00:08:21,052 --> 00:08:21,752
That's all the way.

66
00:08:21,772 --> 00:08:25,934
What do you think the score is going to be?

67
00:08:25,954 --> 00:08:26,934
28-14, Patriots.

68
00:08:26,954 --> 00:08:28,774
Steelers!

69
00:08:29,014 --> 00:08:29,595
Patriots!

70
00:08:29,615 --> 00:08:31,655
The Patriots, obviously.

71
00:08:31,675 --> 00:08:31,875
28-21.

72
00:08:31,955 --> 00:08:34,716
I'm wearing a Brady shirt.

73
00:08:34,736 --> 00:08:36,197
I think that's the answer enough for you.

74
00:08:36,537 --> 00:08:36,837
Patriots 31.

75
00:08:37,994 --> 00:08:38,695
The Patriots definitely.

76
00:08:38,715 --> 00:08:39,135
28-13.

77
00:08:39,155 --> 00:08:39,756
The Patriots.

78
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:40,937
Hands down.

79
00:08:41,017 --> 00:08:42,218
Obviously it's the Pats.

80
00:08:42,238 --> 00:08:42,299
27-24.

81
00:08:42,319 --> 00:08:43,700
Obviously the Patriots.

82
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,661
I calculated it out.

83
00:08:44,701 --> 00:08:45,342
It's gonna be 28-23.

84
00:08:54,232 --> 00:08:55,293
Go Pats, baby.

85
00:08:55,953 --> 00:08:56,354
Pats, 42.

86
00:08:56,734 --> 00:08:59,496
Pittsburgh, 13.

87
00:08:59,656 --> 00:09:00,517
What's up, Metro High School?

88
00:09:00,537 --> 00:09:07,342
This is Nick Hennessy with the Mustang Report, and I'm here at the Metro High School pool where last night the swim team defeated Summerville in their meet.

89
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:11,946
In sports now, first for the boys basketball team, their team has been very strong this year.

90
00:09:12,786 --> 00:09:36,589
uh... led by captain mckay collins as well as a uh... other captains tyree strata conor frasier they've jumped out to a pretty strong record this year specifically sunday be stonem and last night they beat arlington catholic by twenty three points and they also contended with ever for three quarters and that they have led but they've been led this year by not only the captains but big also big man justin kelly as well as incumbent sophomore guard tyla wholeness

91
00:09:37,776 --> 00:09:41,480
Additionally, for the track team, the track team has been very strong this year.

92
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:46,845
However, they have definitely been suffering from, as being a winter sport, they've been suffering from lots of sickness.

93
00:09:47,246 --> 00:09:48,627
Definitely the flu bug is going around.

94
00:09:49,107 --> 00:09:50,549
However, they've had two pretty close meets.

95
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:55,714
Additionally, their sophomore contingent of middle distance runners have been outstanding.

96
00:09:56,074 --> 00:10:00,859
Specifically, Julia Gailback, Willa Driscoll, Megan McGilvery, Lauren Brown,

97
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:10,326
Zoe Salvato-Cutter, as well as sophomores Haley DiPietro Antonio, freshman Jada Hamill, and Joelle Brown.

98
00:10:10,926 --> 00:10:24,334
And also, they've had strong leadership from their captains, such as Amber Harbison, captain Alexa Normyle in the shot put, and they've also gotten some strong outputs in the shot put from junior Tess Morrow.

99
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:38,771
now for the girls basketball team uh... recently they have deftly also caught the injury bug a little bit where ryan and arnold and carmen diario both of torn their ceo and i've done for the year however they've read responded pretty strong as they beat pope john last week

100
00:10:39,858 --> 00:10:42,300
and they are looking to contend for the GBL championship.

101
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:47,803
If they can beat Malden one more time and Everett one more time, they will win the GBL for the last time.

102
00:10:48,223 --> 00:10:54,026
As this year, they will then go into the Northeast Conference with 16 teams.

103
00:10:55,367 --> 00:10:56,127
For Girls Hockey now,

104
00:10:57,188 --> 00:11:22,932
they've started off this is definitely a rebuilding season for them however they have come on strong as of late with a two-game win streak led by strong goaltending from trisha mcclain as well as strong play from their uh... from their star abby abby vigliotti additionally another note for girls hockey uh... one of medford high school's alums britney lanzilli uh... was elected to the women's unit united states national women's university team this is a huge

105
00:11:23,612 --> 00:11:24,973
Huge honor for Lenzilli.

106
00:11:25,654 --> 00:11:27,075
And a couple of other notes for Lenzilli.

107
00:11:27,315 --> 00:11:31,278
She's the third female to score 300 career points in state history.

108
00:11:31,619 --> 00:11:36,543
Additionally, in her junior year, she led the entire nation in goals and in points.

109
00:11:37,977 --> 00:11:41,180
She did break Sean Bates' school record for goals and points.

110
00:11:41,501 --> 00:11:47,847
To boys hockey now, they have had a strong season so far, led by goaltending from seniors Matt Santos and Jonathan Haley.

111
00:11:48,187 --> 00:11:53,172
Additionally, they have had some strong play from juniors Ryan Donohue and David Welch.

112
00:11:54,354 --> 00:11:56,255
And that concludes our Mustang Report for this week.

113
00:11:56,295 --> 00:11:58,558
This has been the Sports Report from Nick Kenniston, and back to you.
