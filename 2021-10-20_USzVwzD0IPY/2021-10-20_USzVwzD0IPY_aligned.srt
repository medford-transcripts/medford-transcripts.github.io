1
00:00:00,131 --> 00:00:07,319
Sorry, that, you know, it's really going to be based on the students need very individualized.

2
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:15,107
So, um, Tanya, I don't know if you would like me to answer questions about adaptive phys ed first and then move on to unified sports.

3
00:00:15,628 --> 00:00:15,848
Yeah.

4
00:00:15,968 --> 00:00:17,410
Um, Jimmy, I know you have your hand up.

5
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:19,472
Is it about adaptive or unified?

6
00:00:23,604 --> 00:00:24,665
It's about adaptive, I think.

7
00:00:24,685 --> 00:00:27,186
I'm not sure I understand what unified sports is yet.

8
00:00:27,426 --> 00:00:28,947
That's what she's going to talk about next, right?

9
00:00:29,908 --> 00:00:33,590
I don't know why this keeps playing.

10
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:36,331
So are you noticing that this is...

11
00:00:37,978 --> 00:00:54,970
for the ref, you said you're getting referrals, like you have 70, 75 referrals, is that referred from the physical, from the PE teachers referring or the teachers referring the students or parents are asking for this?

12
00:00:55,613 --> 00:00:58,597
No, this is only so far from teachers.

13
00:00:58,657 --> 00:01:04,225
So PE teachers, classroom teachers.

14
00:01:04,505 --> 00:01:08,311
And what are the age ranges that typically these kids are being referred at?

15
00:01:09,312 --> 00:01:10,894
Majority is elementary level.

16
00:01:12,376 --> 00:01:14,237
Okay.

17
00:01:14,257 --> 00:01:25,004
I'm just asking because I'm, you know, this would have been huge for my son he's 17 now he's a senior, but this would have been huge for him when he was younger he was diagnosed with autism, and one of the biggest problems he had was.

18
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:38,685
being able to work in any kind of team or group setting, following the instructions, you know, having a group of kids go do something that's completely difficult for him.

19
00:01:38,985 --> 00:01:45,568
Now, as he's gotten a little bit older, it's gotten a little bit better, but by this age, he's like, no sports for me.

20
00:01:45,908 --> 00:01:46,268
I'm out.

21
00:01:46,388 --> 00:01:47,669
I don't want to have anything to do with sports.

22
00:01:48,629 --> 00:01:52,211
And I feel like because he didn't have the base of a positive

23
00:01:53,133 --> 00:01:57,380
PE experience when he was younger now it's like nope, I'm not going to do anything like that.

24
00:01:58,902 --> 00:02:02,167
And so I'm wondering, now, is this something that it.

25
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:15,813
a child would, you guys would recognize when going through the process of diagnosing kids and evaluating them, where you say, hey, no, this kid also needs help in PE, and he's going to get that support as well, and they'll put it in the IEP.

26
00:02:15,893 --> 00:02:20,174
Is this an automatic thing, or are we just educating the parents so that Medford can decide?

27
00:02:20,214 --> 00:02:23,475
Maybe that's a question for Joan, Medford to decide if we're going to start doing this.

28
00:02:25,578 --> 00:02:32,183
So we are doing this what's happening is once we do the referral and Carla conducts her assessment.

29
00:02:32,784 --> 00:02:46,174
That we look at the specific goals and objectives that the student would require for the AP and what the model will look like what the service delivery will look like so it's going to be individualized and our hope is to expand it.

30
00:02:46,554 --> 00:03:07,407
and have more physical education teachers trained in this, so that all schools have a PE people, but Carla is really driving so this is like our pilot year so we're very excited to have it in our school system, but there is an evaluation process, there will be discussions with the parents saying, you know, we.

31
00:03:08,686 --> 00:03:16,496
We feel your child may be appropriate for an assessment, so we're going to conduct an assessment and then come up with the goals and objectives to address that.

32
00:03:17,278 --> 00:03:22,785
Can a parent initiate this or is it from the teacher PE side?

33
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,091
I think it could be either.

34
00:03:26,111 --> 00:03:36,814
I mean, if the parent has concerns, I mean, like just any evaluation, if a parent has concerns, we want to look at those and address them and assess them to see where we go.

35
00:03:36,894 --> 00:03:51,737
So I think we would welcome parent referrals, but right now we're leaning towards the physical education teachers because they see the students firsthand and the teachers see them firsthand and maybe the struggles that they're seeing in the phys ed

36
00:03:52,457 --> 00:03:54,198
physical education class either.

37
00:03:54,799 --> 00:04:07,162
frustration or like in the video, they don't understand the directions, they're having difficulty following along or they find motor skills, you know, and what sort of adaptive equipment they would need.

38
00:04:07,242 --> 00:04:23,867
So that's where we're at right now is just getting all this information together, which will really help us in the coming years of where, you know, what direction we're going in, but we would welcome referrals and we would observe the student and then decide if an evaluation was appropriate.

39
00:04:26,368 --> 00:04:27,889
Sharon, I know you had your hand up.

40
00:04:27,909 --> 00:04:29,029
Do you want to ask your question?

41
00:04:29,049 --> 00:04:30,009
I do.

42
00:04:30,109 --> 00:04:30,590
Thank you.

43
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,311
So my daughter is in second grade.

44
00:04:33,411 --> 00:04:43,855
And when she was in kindergarten, I specifically asked about adaptive PE at her IEP meeting and was told we didn't have it and that the PT would be accompanying her to PE class.

45
00:04:44,015 --> 00:04:45,015
I love our PT.

46
00:04:45,135 --> 00:04:46,656
I've been nothing but happy with her.

47
00:04:47,176 --> 00:04:48,196
But I joined the meeting.

48
00:04:48,216 --> 00:04:49,617
And I apologize that I joined late.

49
00:04:49,677 --> 00:04:51,938
But I joined right as you were saying, Carla,

50
00:04:52,518 --> 00:04:55,519
that a PT is not a substitute for an adaptive PE teacher.

51
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:58,621
So my daughter is up for her reaval right now.

52
00:04:58,681 --> 00:05:04,283
I have to sign the paper saying we're agreed to the evaluations.

53
00:05:04,643 --> 00:05:09,225
Is this something we can ask for since she is in a three-year reaval in second grade?

54
00:05:09,987 --> 00:05:10,167
Right.

55
00:05:10,247 --> 00:05:22,941
And I'm just to clarify that to the PT absolutely can be in the, in the gym, if the physical therapy is going to help the student access the curriculum, so that that can happen.

56
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:26,725
What I just mean by that is the PT wouldn't be teaching the curriculum.

57
00:05:28,266 --> 00:05:35,149
So if your student were to require a more specialized instruction of the curriculum, then that would be where the APE comes in.

58
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:48,435
But absolutely, the PT can still accompany the student to general ed, to their PE class, if it's helping your child's access.

59
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,896
I get the sense she's like assisting her in class.

60
00:05:50,996 --> 00:05:52,097
I mean, that's my sense.

61
00:05:52,757 --> 00:05:59,538
Yeah, and that could be, you know, they could be doing certain exercises that are helping her, you know, participate in the general ed PE class.

62
00:05:59,598 --> 00:06:03,319
And like, like we said, that we're always going to look at the least restrictive environment.

63
00:06:03,599 --> 00:06:08,820
And, you know, the hope is that the student can remain in a general PE class with those accommodations.

64
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:18,662
And the accommodation could include, you know, PT service at that time, if that's what, you know, and maybe I don't know if Denise, you want to speak on that, but, you know, my,

65
00:06:19,262 --> 00:06:25,284
My theory is that a PT is needed for a student to access certain curriculum and if that's why the related services there.

66
00:06:26,965 --> 00:06:32,067
So that's the difference is that the PT helps access the AP is the curriculum.

67
00:06:32,627 --> 00:06:33,187
If that.

68
00:06:33,527 --> 00:06:35,268
Okay, that does that does that helps.

69
00:06:35,608 --> 00:06:36,088
Thank you.

70
00:06:36,209 --> 00:06:38,910
And in regards to the three year evaluation.

71
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:39,050
I mean,

72
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:47,175
This would be a good time to conduct the assessment for APE because we're doing all the assessment at once.

73
00:06:47,255 --> 00:06:57,423
So, you know, we have said to the, we've spoken to the evaluation team leaders, Carla did a presentation to all the, I meet with the ETLs every week.

74
00:06:57,803 --> 00:07:00,185
She did the same presentation and we said, you know,

75
00:07:00,585 --> 00:07:18,246
She's going to be reaching out to do, you know, as they, as these students come to her attention and she does the observations, but if there is a three year reevaluation coming up and you feel that a student would require it, then we would we would want to add that assessment to the consent form.

76
00:07:19,067 --> 00:07:20,807
I'd reach out to your ETL.

77
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:26,108
You can see me on the email, and if they have any questions, I can explain it further to them.

78
00:07:26,609 --> 00:07:32,510
But I think during the three-year evaluation process, it's a good time to conduct that assessment as well.

79
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:33,410
OK.

80
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:48,253
I think my question for Carla, Alex, I'm sorry, or as the other PT in Medford, is where does the APE teacher's role fall in educating the general education PE teachers?

81
00:07:49,203 --> 00:08:10,042
I think that's a huge, huge area that both PTs that have been in Medford, myself, I've been here for a longer period than Nicole, but we have worked very hard on working with the general education teachers to understand a child's physical or social, emotional or cognitive issues.

82
00:08:10,878 --> 00:08:14,799
I mean, I think that Joan would agree that is part of our role, either OT or PT.

83
00:08:14,859 --> 00:08:17,640
It's part of our role to sort of work with the general education.

84
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:27,023
But where, as an adaptive PE teacher, I guess, where do you see the role of adaptive PE?

85
00:08:27,103 --> 00:08:29,323
Do you see that taking over for us?

86
00:08:29,743 --> 00:08:35,225
I mean, not that I'm not going to say we'd love to give it to you, but do you, I mean,

87
00:08:36,752 --> 00:08:41,115
envisioning moving forward that you will be the one educating the PE teachers.

88
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:48,820
I mean in terms of, you know, providing PE teachers with accommodations and best practice and the best way to modify curriculum.

89
00:08:49,581 --> 00:08:53,644
Yeah, I would provide that for PE teachers, but in terms of.

90
00:08:54,718 --> 00:09:00,562
You know, like I said before, it doesn't, it's not going to replace the service, so it wouldn't replace PT if PT was.

91
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:02,363
No, I'm not asking you to replace PT.

92
00:09:02,623 --> 00:09:03,204
I understand.

93
00:09:04,484 --> 00:09:12,510
No, I understand the difference, I hope, between APE and PT, but I guess my concern is more where the least restrictive environment is what we're all hoping for.

94
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:26,623
that I do think that there's an opportunity with some teaching that may or may not have fallen under the realm of various related service providers or various special education people, but now having an adaptive PE person in the district.

95
00:09:27,223 --> 00:09:31,027
Will you have a staff, I guess, is what it sounds like Denise is asking to me.

96
00:09:31,107 --> 00:09:31,467
Will you have

97
00:09:33,349 --> 00:09:42,561
teachers, or will or who will be training the general PT to the gen ed PE teachers, so that they are fluent in a PE.

98
00:09:43,121 --> 00:09:52,172
So, that correct me that Carla I think, I think the goal for the district is we're starting this pilot now, and we want the program up and running.

99
00:09:52,733 --> 00:09:57,636
And we're hoping to have more of the physical education teachers take the APE training.

100
00:09:58,036 --> 00:10:01,198
So we want as many staff members trained as possible.

101
00:10:01,258 --> 00:10:12,524
So it just doesn't fall on Carla's shoulders, but we also want everyone in the building to be aware of what APE means and that they can provide that as well.

102
00:10:12,544 --> 00:10:21,529
So we would like to expand upon this as the years go on and provide that training to as many staff as possible, because, I mean,

103
00:10:22,168 --> 00:10:38,273
the more inclusive that we can be and have students and have teachers have the skills, just like we want our general education teachers to have skills when our students with disabilities are in their history or math or science class, we want the same for our physical education teachers.

104
00:10:38,573 --> 00:10:40,434
Right, so I think you said it perfectly.

105
00:10:40,815 --> 00:11:01,490
Obviously, our director but yeah just you know you might have you might have students that are in a general education class and they're able to access the curriculum with modifications and accommodations and we continue, you know, those teachers are continuing to educate themselves on how to do that on how to provide accommodations and modifications to students who have an IP.

106
00:11:03,271 --> 00:11:11,818
So that would be something that, like Joan said, there have been already, there's already been a professional development with myself and the PE teachers.

107
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:19,604
But in addition to that, we do still have special education teachers for math and English and all the subjects.

108
00:11:19,684 --> 00:11:22,306
And that would be the same for physical education.

109
00:11:23,687 --> 00:11:30,813
Although the PE teachers would still be educating themselves, we would also have the AP role for that extra specialized instruction.

110
00:11:34,631 --> 00:11:35,351
Is there a time?

111
00:11:35,511 --> 00:11:36,672
Oh, sorry, Alex, go ahead.

112
00:11:36,692 --> 00:11:38,052
Yeah, just a short one.

113
00:11:38,372 --> 00:11:43,114
So I was wondering, just to kind of understand the timeline, so right now you are just evaluating, right?

114
00:11:43,254 --> 00:11:46,095
The AP is not yet in an IEP.

115
00:11:46,896 --> 00:11:57,860
It's not yet in an IEP that I have, you know, assessed and put it in an IEP yet, because like I said, there, we still need parent consent, and we're just, you know, it's only October, but

116
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:09,208
possibly there may be students that are coming into the district with this already on their IEP so that would be right now maybe the only case where it would be on an IEP at this moment to date.

117
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:22,879
And because this is like I'm hearing it's a pilot year, do you think that all the kids who could potentially qualify are gonna get that in the IEP or are you gonna cap it that you know we start with 20 kids or

118
00:12:24,073 --> 00:12:29,077
No, I mean, to address that, I mean, I don't think we can really cap specialized services.

119
00:12:29,137 --> 00:12:33,280
If a student requires it, then it gets written on their IEP.

120
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:38,684
And that's, you know, the team feels that it's appropriate and the student requires it, then absolutely.

121
00:12:39,065 --> 00:12:49,452
I mean, right on top of Carla doing the observation and the assessment, she is providing APE to students throughout the district right now without it being on their IEP.

122
00:12:50,453 --> 00:12:52,495
It's not like she's just doing observation.

123
00:12:52,555 --> 00:12:57,358
I mean, I see Carla with her bag going from school to school.

124
00:12:57,819 --> 00:13:11,809
So she is providing that APE right now, but we are working on identifying those specific students, what they require and having specific goals and objectives to address in the APE class.

125
00:13:11,829 --> 00:13:15,312
So those will be added to whoever requires it.

126
00:13:15,865 --> 00:13:20,567
Yeah, and I did set a timeline for myself, and I presented that to administration.

127
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:25,209
And based on the timeline, we're ahead to right on track with that.

128
00:13:25,289 --> 00:13:31,452
So in November, I want to start the formal assessments, which means the consents will be going out.

129
00:13:32,012 --> 00:13:38,095
And I do expect to have this on IEPs many, if not all, by June, honestly.

130
00:13:38,115 --> 00:13:45,118
Carla, and probably Joan, too.

131
00:13:46,476 --> 00:13:54,422
As far as what Denise was talking about before, so kind of, you know, where does the responsibility land?

132
00:13:57,083 --> 00:14:05,349
Are all the current phys ed teachers already in a direct path to have training for APE?

133
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:09,492
Or do they have to have it by a certain time?

134
00:14:11,342 --> 00:14:22,891
So we honestly have not worked out the logistics of that yet, but that is, those are the next steps that Carla, Rachel, Perry, and I, we meet on a consistent basis to discuss things.

135
00:14:22,951 --> 00:14:25,493
So that will be the next steps that we take.

136
00:14:26,974 --> 00:14:28,535
And who would fall into that category?

137
00:14:28,555 --> 00:14:33,198
Would it just be the phys ed teachers or would paras?

138
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:36,340
It would be the physical education teachers.

139
00:14:36,581 --> 00:14:36,901
Okay.

140
00:14:37,341 --> 00:14:37,481
Yep.

141
00:14:39,383 --> 00:14:39,683
Thank you.

142
00:14:40,302 --> 00:14:41,323
Yep, sure.

143
00:14:47,031 --> 00:14:48,072
And did you have a question?

144
00:14:48,613 --> 00:14:52,318
Yeah, no, I was gonna say, I imagine it's a licensing thing, right?

145
00:14:52,398 --> 00:14:57,044
Just like PE and PT can't be exchanged because legally it's a different license.

146
00:14:57,468 --> 00:15:03,150
Right, so you know, as much as we want to educate, like special education teachers are still needed in the district.

147
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:09,071
And then there are general education teachers that are all educated on how to provide accommodations and modifications.

148
00:15:09,131 --> 00:15:13,632
But like you said, at the end of the day, they are different things in terms of licensure.

149
00:15:13,692 --> 00:15:16,573
So I'm a licensed adaptive physical education teacher.

150
00:15:17,233 --> 00:15:21,135
And, you know, the general physical education teachers are not.

151
00:15:21,155 --> 00:15:24,956
And in districts around us, they are different things.

152
00:15:25,036 --> 00:15:25,176
So

153
00:15:27,227 --> 00:15:40,652
I feel that I could help provide that training to general physical education teachers because it's beneficial, but there will be situations where students require a small group taught by an adapted physical education teacher specifically.

154
00:15:42,212 --> 00:15:42,913
Right.

155
00:15:43,073 --> 00:15:54,397
And I can support that Denise has done a wonderful job already with my son when he was at the Roberts, speaking to the gen ed PE teacher for accommodations, trying to use the right words.

156
00:15:54,737 --> 00:15:54,877
Right.

157
00:16:00,297 --> 00:16:01,609
Jamil, did you have another question?

158
00:16:03,178 --> 00:16:03,718
you're on mute.

159
00:16:04,239 --> 00:16:11,504
I just wanted to quickly say, and this is probably the same issue you have with, you know, special ed teacher, and the kids are all so different.

160
00:16:11,524 --> 00:16:18,690
And I'm just trying to visualize, Carla, I guess you can say, I mean, the kids that have these disabilities, these are very different disabilities.

161
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:28,517
And, you know, a kid who can't hit a baseball is very different than a kid who can't socialize versus a kid who can't see versus a kid, you know, they're just very different disabilities.

162
00:16:29,297 --> 00:16:30,899
And I'm trying to visualize how,

163
00:16:32,655 --> 00:16:43,767
I mean this is the same issue with even, you know, teaching English or whatever but I mean how one, somebody could be trained in, in helping all the different kinds of kids out there that might have a disability.

164
00:16:43,787 --> 00:16:44,848
Right, so the.

165
00:16:45,309 --> 00:16:46,670
Yeah, I know you can finish.

166
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:49,053
No, I'm kind of done I'm like how is it that even.

167
00:16:49,793 --> 00:16:50,714
That seems a little like.

168
00:16:51,902 --> 00:16:56,267
I'm sure you'll, you know, everybody will try to accommodate the needs of every specific child.

169
00:16:56,447 --> 00:17:02,014
I mean, it's the same challenge you have academics as a first, you know, as phys eds, but it's just, I'm trying to imagine how it would work.

170
00:17:02,494 --> 00:17:04,236
Are you thinking it's like a lofty goal?

171
00:17:04,577 --> 00:17:06,699
Yeah.

172
00:17:06,939 --> 00:17:08,722
So I'll give you kind of two examples.

173
00:17:10,043 --> 00:17:30,010
let's take a visual impairment and maybe that student is in general PE, you know, the adaptive phys ed teacher might come in and provide the accommodations needed or the general PE teacher could too, but if the student just requires maybe like red tape around a ball for a, you know, in a certain visual impairment,

174
00:17:31,231 --> 00:17:34,574
And that could be all it is like certain equipment could also cover that.

175
00:17:34,594 --> 00:17:40,900
And then I think of like, we do have, you know, every district has substantially separate classrooms.

176
00:17:41,721 --> 00:17:43,803
And that's more of a kind of a small group setting.

177
00:17:44,584 --> 00:17:50,389
And a lot of those needs can be addressed just just on, you know, the basis that there is a smaller group so.

178
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:55,871
you know, maybe students with sensory issues due to autism, right?

179
00:17:56,231 --> 00:18:05,654
It's really hard to be in a class of 30 kids or whatever it is in the gym, especially, you know, with whatever's going on, loud noises around the building, the echoing, all of that.

180
00:18:05,734 --> 00:18:07,074
So that's really difficult.

181
00:18:07,154 --> 00:18:10,115
So that's kind of where the small group instruction is really beneficial.

182
00:18:10,175 --> 00:18:13,736
And, you know, I know there is a whole array of, and

183
00:18:15,977 --> 00:18:22,603
observing for the past couple of weeks, I have, you know, really put eyes on a lot of our students with disabilities, if not all of them.

184
00:18:22,663 --> 00:18:24,024
And I, you know, that is true.

185
00:18:24,064 --> 00:18:26,226
There's many different types.

186
00:18:26,866 --> 00:18:29,609
So it's all about, you know, what does that student require?

187
00:18:30,529 --> 00:18:32,551
And where does small group come in?

188
00:18:32,691 --> 00:18:34,613
Where does one to one instruction come in?

189
00:18:34,793 --> 00:18:36,575
Where does the push-in model come in?

190
00:18:37,615 --> 00:18:40,137
And how do we make that work for the students who require it?

191
00:18:40,197 --> 00:18:46,301
So really what's important is doing the assessment and first determining what students do require this.

192
00:18:46,361 --> 00:18:48,042
And that's obviously the first step.

193
00:18:48,822 --> 00:18:50,844
And then we kind of look at the layout of everything.

194
00:18:54,606 --> 00:18:59,669
Wouldn't the first step be determining what is the goal?

195
00:18:59,729 --> 00:19:04,452
I guess there are already physical education goals already been determined by the

196
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:07,832
Department of Education, right?

197
00:19:07,932 --> 00:19:11,835
You're supposed to be able to, I assume, you know, run around.

198
00:19:11,915 --> 00:19:13,417
I don't know what the rules are.

199
00:19:13,437 --> 00:19:15,839
Hopping, skipping, jumping, locomotive, yeah.

200
00:19:15,899 --> 00:19:17,060
Okay, yeah, all that stuff.

201
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:22,225
Okay, so that's, and then some kids, because some kids can do all that, but maybe they can't do it in a group setting, or maybe they can't play.

202
00:19:22,585 --> 00:19:25,688
I'm just thinking of my kid, of course, everybody comes from their own personal experience.

203
00:19:25,968 --> 00:19:31,610
being able to play on a team, being able to follow instructions, that kind of stuff.

204
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:35,691
So that's where I'm coming from and it's like, and is that part of physical education goals?

205
00:19:35,731 --> 00:19:36,372
And I guess it is.

206
00:19:36,912 --> 00:19:41,073
So the goals, but I will tell you the assessment that I'm using, it does have all those pieces.

207
00:19:41,193 --> 00:19:48,036
It has the behavioral, the cognitive, it does have questions and a certain rating scale for all of those concerns.

208
00:19:53,752 --> 00:19:56,174
Well, I for one want to say that it's really exciting.

209
00:19:56,254 --> 00:20:06,860
And I know that, I mean, you all know, and Melanie, you certainly know that we've been trying to get this for a long time and it finally showed up in the budget magically.

210
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,881
It's amazing.

211
00:20:08,982 --> 00:20:14,525
Does anybody else have any more questions on the APE or do you want to move on to the unified sports?

212
00:20:18,528 --> 00:20:21,250
I'm going to take that as a hard yes to move on.

213
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:21,570
Yep.

214
00:20:22,995 --> 00:20:23,395
All right.

215
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:27,877
The unified sports is, um, how should I say this way?

216
00:20:28,097 --> 00:20:29,137
Like lighter, I guess.

217
00:20:29,197 --> 00:20:29,397
Right.

218
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:32,278
So it's, you know, there's no real requirements around it.

219
00:20:32,318 --> 00:20:33,758
There's no assessment around it.

220
00:20:33,918 --> 00:20:37,600
It's, it's just a really awesome, fun thing that we're able to have in Medford.

221
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:46,322
And, um, you know, after we talked a little bit about it, I can let Tanya kind of have a testimonial on that because she has been at our game so far.

222
00:20:46,382 --> 00:20:51,224
So I'm going to present this again and I'm not, hold on one, give me one second.

223
00:20:57,961 --> 00:20:58,862
Can we all see this good.

224
00:21:00,704 --> 00:21:09,975
Okay unified sports so I'm unified sports is right now we have basketball at the high school level, that is where we have started.

225
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:15,701
So, it is a program set forth by the Special Olympics of Massachusetts.

226
00:21:17,731 --> 00:21:19,232
do provide a stipend.

227
00:21:19,492 --> 00:21:24,274
So for uniforms for referees, things like that for the buses to and from the game.

228
00:21:25,015 --> 00:21:25,915
So that's really great.

229
00:21:27,516 --> 00:21:30,998
We play other schools around our district.

230
00:21:31,358 --> 00:21:36,821
So in this case, the GBL, we have a couple of non greater Boston League teams that we're playing.

231
00:21:38,121 --> 00:21:42,223
And yes, Melanie, we do play tomorrow at 330 at home if you guys want to come check it out.

232
00:21:42,243 --> 00:21:42,723
So

233
00:21:43,944 --> 00:21:51,672
To get into it again like I said the Special Olympics, it brings together athletes, both with and without disabilities to train and compete on the same team.

234
00:21:52,513 --> 00:22:04,565
And here are just some of the main takeaways of it participants improve their physical fitness, which again is why you know physical education is for everybody, not everybody wants to play sports after school.

235
00:22:05,546 --> 00:22:14,911
However, if we have adaptive physical education at Medford, I think it's really going to tie in nicely to be able to participate safely in unified sports.

236
00:22:16,011 --> 00:22:31,178
So students, both with and without disabilities, sharpen their skills and learn acceptance and inclusion, which has been just wonderful for, I think, some of the students without disabilities who maybe didn't know how much they would really fall in love with this.

237
00:22:31,258 --> 00:22:32,799
And it's been really nice to see.

238
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:45,011
You know, I think it's really important to bridge that gap between our students with and without disabilities and promote inclusion through team practice and competition so.

239
00:22:47,580 --> 00:23:04,210
Everyone is welcome so it is for students of all abilities, which is something I keep saying the way that the Special Olympics breaks it down, is that you have partners, and you have athletes and the athletes have intellectual disabilities.

240
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:08,972
But what I have come to realize is that students signed up, you know.

241
00:23:10,113 --> 00:23:14,775
And maybe they signed up as a partner, but in fact have a disability themselves.

242
00:23:15,276 --> 00:23:19,198
So it really doesn't matter, I guess, the level of disability.

243
00:23:19,218 --> 00:23:21,199
That all goes out the window.

244
00:23:21,259 --> 00:23:22,579
It's for students of all abilities.

245
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:33,765
So maybe some students with a disability have taken on more of that experienced leadership role, and others might be participating as an entry-level team player.

246
00:23:34,601 --> 00:23:36,182
So that's sort of how I'm looking at it.

247
00:23:37,002 --> 00:23:39,263
So it's not black and white.

248
00:23:39,383 --> 00:23:45,626
It's not like kids with disabilities are on this side and they're being helped by kids without disabilities.

249
00:23:45,766 --> 00:23:47,066
It hasn't been like that at all.

250
00:23:47,106 --> 00:23:50,388
It's really just been all abilities across the board.

251
00:23:51,208 --> 00:23:55,450
And there is no separation of students at all.

252
00:23:56,922 --> 00:24:11,656
What we have going on right now is at the high school level we have basketball in the fall, and you are eligible if you are a freshman, all the way up to postgraduate so if you're a student is going to be attending Medford High School until the age of 22.

253
00:24:11,736 --> 00:24:15,419
They can participate in this and.

254
00:24:16,933 --> 00:24:23,836
I believe and don't correct me if I'm wrong but um, I believe that that goes to out of district students as well.

255
00:24:24,176 --> 00:24:27,797
So from freshman to postgraduate can can participate as well.

256
00:24:29,238 --> 00:24:35,200
Yep, so we have a total of five games, so you know nothing too long, you know we want to keep interest in it.

257
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:41,423
One end of the year jamboree, we have uniforms, everything you'd see and experience at a typical high school game.

258
00:24:42,764 --> 00:24:49,609
We have announcing of who scored a basket, we're introducing students at the beginning, we have the national anthem, the whole thing.

259
00:24:49,629 --> 00:24:51,590
So it's been really awesome.

260
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:55,012
We had a huge turnout, our first home game, which was two weeks ago.

261
00:24:55,852 --> 00:24:59,215
We have a home game tomorrow, and last week we played at Malden.

262
00:25:00,175 --> 00:25:02,839
In the spring we're going to have high school track and field.

263
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:08,006
I don't know about the meets or anything like that, but I do know that we are participating in it.

264
00:25:08,066 --> 00:25:09,187
We've signed up to join.

265
00:25:10,482 --> 00:25:19,631
And I got an email today about middle school unified and attending a information session about bringing middle school unified sports to Medford.

266
00:25:19,671 --> 00:25:32,583
So we had initially anticipated that for next year, this being our first year doing it, but I'm probably gonna attend that session tomorrow and learn more about it and how we can bring it to the middle school level as well.

267
00:25:35,698 --> 00:25:36,458
Is that my last slide?

268
00:25:36,478 --> 00:25:39,180
That may have been my last slide on Unified.

269
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,360
But I think it would be great.

270
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,641
I don't know, maybe if Tanya, you want to speak about it.

271
00:25:43,381 --> 00:25:45,522
You have a son on the team, so.

272
00:25:45,542 --> 00:25:46,823
I do.

273
00:25:49,044 --> 00:26:03,550
Actually, I've wanted him to be involved in sports for all of high school, but certain limitations can make you hesitant, can make you doubt.

274
00:26:05,611 --> 00:26:13,436
whether the services are in place, it's scary on some level as a parent.

275
00:26:15,117 --> 00:26:19,820
Him being involved in this, having practice on Mondays, he loves it.

276
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:21,141
He looks forward to it.

277
00:26:22,021 --> 00:26:23,222
The games are exciting.

278
00:26:24,123 --> 00:26:26,664
And if you go to the games, you will see.

279
00:26:26,684 --> 00:26:33,709
It was interesting when we were at Malden last week, there was a student in a wheelchair

280
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:38,472
And who was just as active in the whole progression.

281
00:26:39,052 --> 00:26:47,218
And the other thing that was that is really kind of neat is that, you know, the kids that are signing up that don't have a disability.

282
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:54,543
learning a lot of outward facing coaching.

283
00:26:55,164 --> 00:27:01,208
So, you know, instead of them saying, see, I'll show you how to do it there.

284
00:27:01,408 --> 00:27:09,373
You can, you can actually see them thinking on the floor, you know what, let me give the ball to the student, to this teammate and let them do it.

285
00:27:10,514 --> 00:27:13,896
And then, you know, it's just, it's, it's very organic.

286
00:27:15,938 --> 00:27:17,039
And I think that that's what

287
00:27:18,272 --> 00:27:19,293
is the best part of it.

288
00:27:19,794 --> 00:27:20,875
The kids get excited.

289
00:27:20,895 --> 00:27:24,338
Um, you know, there is the scores being kept.

290
00:27:24,438 --> 00:27:28,522
It's, you know, the boards lit up, um, all the team in Medford.

291
00:27:28,562 --> 00:27:32,666
I noticed that, you know, we announced each of the team members, which was kind of cool in the beginning.

292
00:27:33,247 --> 00:27:34,728
Um, they didn't do that at Malden.

293
00:27:34,748 --> 00:27:36,610
So it's, it's been kind of neat to see.

294
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:41,195
Um, and I'm curious to see at the next few games to kind of

295
00:27:41,775 --> 00:27:47,898
you know, what it looks like at the away games, you know, signage, um, advertising, you know, getting the word out.

296
00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:50,840
Um, and I did just, uh, send out an email.

297
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:54,062
I think it was yesterday to pretty much the entire town.

298
00:27:54,702 --> 00:28:03,306
Um, just to kind of, you know, remind people that we definitely don't want this to be, uh, you know, like a crock pot recipe, set it and forget it.

299
00:28:03,527 --> 00:28:04,427
Like, here you go.

300
00:28:04,527 --> 00:28:05,408
Here's the funding.

301
00:28:05,848 --> 00:28:06,088
Okay.

302
00:28:07,051 --> 00:28:08,252
you know, you got what you want.

303
00:28:08,872 --> 00:28:10,734
Um, it's, it's so much more than that.

304
00:28:10,854 --> 00:28:15,738
And I just, I just think that it's, I think that you actually have to see it to understand it.

305
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:21,902
Um, so I really recommend anybody, you know, definitely attending, attending the games.

306
00:28:21,963 --> 00:28:23,344
The kids love it.

307
00:28:24,144 --> 00:28:27,607
Um, you know, after the game was over, you know, they are all doing the

308
00:28:29,525 --> 00:28:30,445
Carla, what do you call that?

309
00:28:30,525 --> 00:28:35,046
When they all slap the hand, they give the high five to each player going by, I don't know what you call that.

310
00:28:36,907 --> 00:28:52,110
But it's very powerful as a parent to see my kid finally doing that with other kids who signed up on their own.

311
00:28:53,097 --> 00:28:55,078
who wanna be there, who wanna do it.

312
00:28:56,598 --> 00:29:06,781
And hopefully this will also forge, you know, organic friendships between kids with and without disabilities, which is something the special education subcommittee is putting forward.

313
00:29:06,801 --> 00:29:13,623
So there's just a lot of, you know, we have the disability awareness curriculum being implemented in Medford public schools this year.

314
00:29:13,943 --> 00:29:15,863
So everything just kind of ties together.

315
00:29:16,224 --> 00:29:18,924
And this is just another part of it.

316
00:29:19,484 --> 00:29:21,285
And, you know, even though it's,

317
00:29:22,016 --> 00:29:24,877
even though it's a little late, it's better late than never.

318
00:29:24,897 --> 00:29:31,580
I would rather have my kid experience it now and moving forward than to not have experienced it at all.

319
00:29:38,102 --> 00:29:42,944
Carla, I cannot tell you how great it would be to have something in middle school.

320
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:50,837
you know, coming to the meeting thinking, I'm going to listen to what, you know, I'm going to find out as much as I can.

321
00:29:50,877 --> 00:29:56,243
And then I was about to send you an email asking about this, you know, because we are really waiting for this.

322
00:29:57,525 --> 00:30:01,650
So it's just great, like, the sooner the better, you know, like Tanya says.

323
00:30:02,094 --> 00:30:02,594
I agree.

324
00:30:02,794 --> 00:30:09,697
Um, and, and I think that it goes without saying that to have that, you know, um, together, not separate starting in middle school.

325
00:30:09,777 --> 00:30:28,865
So like you mentioned Tanya, the, um, disability awareness curriculum, um, if we can have kids at that really tough middle school age, you know, um, feeling the school inclusivity and the school pride and just the togetherness of, of everybody that's in their school, um, you know, to start there, I think is, is really impactful.

326
00:30:29,485 --> 00:30:37,688
and then it becomes kind of like the next eight years in high school for the students who attend till they're 22, you know, we really could build up something really special.

327
00:30:39,389 --> 00:30:53,013
And that's one of the things that, you know, we had talked about in terms of the friendship building as well, when we were talking with the autism support group who were, you know, actively interviewing the Best Buddies program.

328
00:30:53,093 --> 00:30:57,275
And they were talking about the Best Buddies program really being implemented at the middle school level because

329
00:30:57,927 --> 00:31:06,991
that's when students are struggling, all students are really struggling with identity and friendships and all the things that middle schoolers struggle with.

330
00:31:07,011 --> 00:31:20,737
So it's actually the prime time and place to make sure that those things are happening and also gives an outlet for the students there to give all students an opportunity to build those friendships outside of sort of the regular school day.

331
00:31:21,237 --> 00:31:23,458
So it seems to be a good fit there as well.

332
00:31:23,498 --> 00:31:25,459
And then back to Carla, your point around,

333
00:31:27,509 --> 00:31:37,532
out of district students, obviously I know that they are welcome in the life of the school and should be participating in the life of the school and offer the opportunity to participate in the life of the school.

334
00:31:38,032 --> 00:31:41,173
The question is, how is that information actually getting pushed out to them?

335
00:31:41,293 --> 00:31:55,818
So now that we have a unified sports program, and this is great, how, I guess, Joan would be the best person to answer that question or one of the coordinators, how is this information being shared with our out of district families?

336
00:31:58,393 --> 00:32:20,931
So I believe a lot of our out of district families and if they haven't received it at the high school level regarding the unified sports, you know, I would need to know about that but I do feel like we're at a better place where the, with the communication with our out of district families and they are receiving notices, we have an upcoming homecoming dance that I know that

337
00:32:21,871 --> 00:32:24,232
Some people on the call receive the information.

338
00:32:24,612 --> 00:32:33,515
So I'm hoping that we get out more information, but if we're not, then we need to like work on that and make sure that everything is getting out to parents.

339
00:32:34,476 --> 00:32:36,016
So is there a structure for that?

340
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:43,199
So I would assume that would be, I mean, since it's at the high school, it would be the high school out of district students.

341
00:32:43,259 --> 00:32:46,420
So whose role would that be?

342
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:49,481
Would it be the principals, the assistant principals,

343
00:32:49,988 --> 00:32:57,251
So I think it would be both the principals and the evaluation team leaders, because they have the most direct contact with the families.

344
00:32:58,351 --> 00:33:08,636
So I will meet with them, I'll discuss with them, and making sure that everything that comes through Medford, either the high school, the middle school, is getting out to parents.

345
00:33:09,896 --> 00:33:18,279
Yeah, sorry, just to add to that, I did hear, we did specifically reach out to the ETLs about this, about unified sports.

346
00:33:18,319 --> 00:33:26,322
And I did hear back confirmation from one, at least one ETL saying, I sent out the flyer to all her out of district students.

347
00:33:26,342 --> 00:33:29,924
So I know at least in that case, but I did reach out.

348
00:33:29,944 --> 00:33:38,207
And I think I thought maybe Joan did as well to the ETLs about their students who are out of district, making sure they got this specific information.

349
00:33:39,438 --> 00:33:39,958
Thank you.

350
00:33:39,978 --> 00:33:40,739
That would be great.

351
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:55,351
And I think, Joan, at some point, you know, and again, I'm sure this is a CPAC related question too, but just thinking about data collection around this, like really checking to see how much participation there is, if improved communication has happened, that sort of thing.

352
00:33:55,391 --> 00:34:06,180
And maybe this is the year with things happening and, you know, the training around staff and what have you to really be able to check in or do some data collection along the way so that

353
00:34:06,883 --> 00:34:12,066
at the end of the year, we have some idea of whether that's, how that's working and why that's working.

354
00:34:12,506 --> 00:34:17,849
I know we have Anne, myself, and Jameel, I think, right?

355
00:34:18,069 --> 00:34:22,411
At least three of the eight, how many families are on here?

356
00:34:22,431 --> 00:34:28,154
Of the families that are out of district here.

357
00:34:28,314 --> 00:34:31,796
I'm not in the high school, but you guys, no, no, Anne, you're not in high school either.

358
00:34:31,836 --> 00:34:33,157
Jameel, did you get the info?

359
00:34:36,351 --> 00:34:37,492
You're on mute, Jamil.

360
00:34:37,712 --> 00:34:38,633
You're on mute, Jamil.

361
00:34:41,975 --> 00:34:44,477
I haven't gotten anything and it's still a huge problem.

362
00:34:44,878 --> 00:34:46,159
Jonah has not gotten any better.

363
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:52,243
I heard about a notice that goes out from the superintendent weekly.

364
00:34:52,263 --> 00:34:53,864
Do you all get that?

365
00:34:54,905 --> 00:34:55,065
Yep.

366
00:34:55,546 --> 00:34:56,146
I don't get that.

367
00:34:56,727 --> 00:35:01,070
I think Tanya forwarded me something about a chess club.

368
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:04,933
So then I took that and sent that to the principal and he came back and said,

369
00:35:06,076 --> 00:35:09,119
Um, I asked him who's the contact.

370
00:35:09,139 --> 00:35:09,800
He didn't respond.

371
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,381
I asked again, then he responded.

372
00:35:11,421 --> 00:35:13,203
Then I contacted that teacher and everything's great.

373
00:35:13,243 --> 00:35:16,026
So hopefully Quentin will go to a test club meeting soon.

374
00:35:16,526 --> 00:35:21,711
Um, I did get an email a week before the, I got it yesterday about the homecoming dance.

375
00:35:21,771 --> 00:35:23,053
And I said, Oh, week's notice.

376
00:35:23,113 --> 00:35:23,333
Great.

377
00:35:24,057 --> 00:35:27,720
That actually, Jamil, just so you know, nobody got notified of that.

378
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:38,888
And actually what happened was the student, and I just want to kind of expound upon this because I actually emailed Paul about this because it was an issue because the kids in access didn't get notified.

379
00:35:39,308 --> 00:35:42,430
The seniors, the senior class sent out the notices.

380
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,532
So it did not go

381
00:35:45,132 --> 00:35:46,833
to all of the people that it should have gone to.

382
00:35:46,853 --> 00:36:00,442
OK, so I did reach out to Paul and let him know, at which time he did tell the senior class that they need to resend it and they need to send it at the same time to everybody, including out of district and access class.

383
00:36:00,663 --> 00:36:03,985
And wait a minute, the kids in access didn't get the notification.

384
00:36:04,005 --> 00:36:05,526
And is that true?

385
00:36:05,566 --> 00:36:06,547
Huh?

386
00:36:06,987 --> 00:36:09,549
That even a lot of the Gen Ed kids didn't get it either.

387
00:36:09,749 --> 00:36:11,530
It just went out sporadically.

388
00:36:12,511 --> 00:36:12,691
Hmm.

389
00:36:14,067 --> 00:36:20,609
I guess my point is the dance is not really my biggest issue it's just like I cannot, I don't know what parents are getting so I don't know what I'm not getting.

390
00:36:20,989 --> 00:36:29,032
And I bring this up all the time can I just get what all the other parents are getting and I just have no clue unless another parent forward something to me or tells me about something.

391
00:36:29,452 --> 00:36:33,315
Is there a way for so and I don't want to get sidetracked on this.

392
00:36:33,395 --> 00:36:48,165
I know for Carlos, I didn't know about this, this program I didn't know about the unified sports, I, you know, don't know about anything and I brought it up so many times that I do think it's personal, even though I know it's you say it's not so I'll just keep putting it out there and I'll wait to see if I get something.

393
00:36:48,946 --> 00:36:51,107
I think one of the issues which we have.

394
00:36:53,964 --> 00:36:55,665
It's about the Gmail account.

395
00:36:55,725 --> 00:36:59,427
So it typically goes to the student's Gmail account.

396
00:37:01,128 --> 00:37:02,269
I can look into it again.

397
00:37:02,329 --> 00:37:06,571
I mean, when I don't hear from people, I assume that they're getting communication.

398
00:37:06,631 --> 00:37:10,874
So I will continue to work on that, Jamil, because I do want you to get the notifications.

399
00:37:10,914 --> 00:37:11,995
I think it's really important.

400
00:37:12,315 --> 00:37:19,479
I think the last email I got from Paul DeLevo was in June, and he's saying, I'm going to send out a test email to you to make sure you're at least getting my emails.

401
00:37:19,559 --> 00:37:20,720
And I never got the test email.

402
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,061
And then I wrote him and I said, I haven't gotten your test email.

403
00:37:23,101 --> 00:37:24,042
And I never heard back from him.

404
00:37:24,062 --> 00:37:25,062
So that was the last of that.

405
00:37:25,102 --> 00:37:41,372
And then I just also want to add, Joan, that I don't, just so you, just as an aside, like I know this is not the high school, but for us, I get, you know, the principal at our school, the McGlynn, emails me directly as a parent.

406
00:37:41,472 --> 00:37:42,233
I'm on the parent list.

407
00:37:42,253 --> 00:37:43,693
It doesn't need to be Gracie's Gmail.

408
00:37:43,733 --> 00:37:49,757
And maybe it's different at the high school because I know the kids are sort of more, but also for kids that aren't, you know, you know,

409
00:37:50,924 --> 00:37:55,126
able, if you will, to respond on their own email or to use their own email per se.

410
00:37:55,626 --> 00:37:58,368
It seems like there could be a workaround or should be a workaround.

411
00:37:58,388 --> 00:38:18,517
So to this point, getting back to the unified sports piece, to this point, you know, if there's only 33, you know, families in the entire district out of, you know, the 4,000 something, 33 is not a lot, you know, divided by three people, five people, you know, that's 10 phone calls or less.

412
00:38:19,447 --> 00:38:24,391
to call the families and to really do some family outreach on how do we actually make this happen?

413
00:38:24,411 --> 00:38:40,984
Because it has been an ongoing concern and especially, you know, because families, and I know, you know, full disclosure, folks know that my daughter's out of district, but, or, and one of the things that families sacrifice, that students sacrifice when they go out of district is community, right?

414
00:38:41,024 --> 00:38:42,285
We don't have any community.

415
00:38:42,305 --> 00:38:46,408
And so it's even more important that families really get this information.

416
00:38:46,448 --> 00:38:48,350
And so I think I'm really excited about

417
00:38:48,807 --> 00:38:55,409
going to the game tomorrow, we're gonna bring Gracie and we'll see how that all goes, but I'm looking forward to it.

418
00:38:55,469 --> 00:38:59,549
And Jamil, I encourage you if you're around tomorrow at 3.30 to come down to the game.

419
00:38:59,589 --> 00:39:01,910
And I also think it's about building personal relationships.

420
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:05,891
And when you're not in the school and when people don't see you, it's hard to build those relationships.

421
00:39:05,911 --> 00:39:07,611
So this is one of the ways to do them too.

422
00:39:07,671 --> 00:39:12,032
So Carla, I'm really excited about this and I'm really excited about seeing it expand.

423
00:39:12,072 --> 00:39:14,493
And then last plug I wanna put forward is that

424
00:39:15,596 --> 00:39:16,177
the 28th.

425
00:39:16,717 --> 00:39:23,942
So normally we would have our behavioral health and special ed subcommittee this week, but things are really crazy this week.

426
00:39:23,982 --> 00:39:26,964
So it's going to be next week, which is Thursday at six.

427
00:39:27,264 --> 00:39:32,848
And this is where we'll talk about priorities for the year for a special education and or behavioral health.

428
00:39:32,888 --> 00:39:37,251
So, you know, come to that meeting that'll be posted zoom and we'll ask CPAC to post it as well.

429
00:39:37,271 --> 00:39:43,535
But this is where we can talk more as to about unified sports or expanding programs or, you know, any of these issues that we're talking about now.

430
00:39:43,595 --> 00:39:44,476
So thanks guys.

431
00:39:47,931 --> 00:39:53,935
Melanie, I did just want to add that Joan and I and Alex had a conversation about what you had just said.

432
00:39:54,555 --> 00:40:17,390
And that conversation basically stated that for kids that have a Gmail account at the high school level, because they do, everything does go to the kids, the students' Gmail, but the parents of the kids that may not be able to check their own email or whatever, we talked about adding the parents on that,

433
00:40:18,141 --> 00:40:19,383
distribution as well.

434
00:40:19,403 --> 00:40:24,273
And whatever the superintendent sending out to everybody can I get that too.

435
00:40:24,754 --> 00:40:26,517
There's just so much that I'm the one that

436
00:40:27,222 --> 00:40:30,143
I'm the one that shared the superintendent emails with Jamil.

437
00:40:30,303 --> 00:40:31,823
I mean, do you all get them?

438
00:40:32,163 --> 00:40:33,664
If you all get them, why don't I get them?

439
00:40:33,744 --> 00:40:35,564
I just the whole thing baffles me.

440
00:40:35,844 --> 00:40:37,044
It's not brain surgery.

441
00:40:37,605 --> 00:40:38,865
And I'm kind of frustrated about it.

442
00:40:38,885 --> 00:40:42,866
And I don't know what because when I told Paul Delave about it, he goes, well, that's the superintendent's issue.

443
00:40:43,266 --> 00:40:49,868
I'm like, OK, so you guys are all sending out your own little emails to your own list of parents that, you know, the whole thing baffles me.

444
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:51,368
I'll stop talking about it.

445
00:40:51,728 --> 00:40:52,248
But I do.

446
00:40:52,289 --> 00:41:00,655
So the one thing that's been brought up before when we talked about this, and I don't know if it has any validity is school brains, like what email school brains has.

447
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:10,744
So it may have no validity, but I'm just throwing that out there because I've heard that because it because I have no idea if my 13 year old is getting these emails.

448
00:41:10,824 --> 00:41:12,966
And trust me, they don't share it with me.

449
00:41:13,666 --> 00:41:15,768
So I would, you know, I get the emails.

450
00:41:18,792 --> 00:41:20,773
We will work to improve communication.

451
00:41:20,993 --> 00:41:24,174
And I apologize, Jameel, that this continues to be an issue.

452
00:41:24,314 --> 00:41:28,835
And I know that, you know, Joan has reached out a number of times.

453
00:41:28,875 --> 00:41:36,178
So, you know, as a school committee member, but also as a parent that's concerned about this, I'll follow up on this too.

454
00:41:36,278 --> 00:41:47,342
And then Jameel and anyone else who's on this call who doesn't already follow your school's Facebook page or PTO page, every school has their own Facebook or PTO page.

455
00:41:48,687 --> 00:41:53,869
MHS slash MVTHS is the high school's Facebook page.

456
00:41:53,909 --> 00:41:55,809
And they do post a lot of information there.

457
00:41:55,869 --> 00:41:58,590
So definitely join that if you haven't.

458
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:03,232
And if you don't like to be on Facebook, you can always create an account just for that.

459
00:42:04,112 --> 00:42:05,412
But there is information shared there.

460
00:42:05,472 --> 00:42:09,333
And then the superintendent mailings will make sure that you're getting that, Jameel.

461
00:42:09,594 --> 00:42:09,994
Thank you.

462
00:42:12,935 --> 00:42:14,075
And Sarah has a question.

463
00:42:21,538 --> 00:42:22,816
Sarah, do you want to come off mute?

464
00:42:26,703 --> 00:42:32,926
Excuse me, can you tell me what time is going to be tomorrow the game of the unified sport program?

465
00:42:33,446 --> 00:42:32,926
3.30.

466
00:42:33,606 --> 00:42:35,307
It's in the high school?

467
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:35,887
Yes.

468
00:42:36,668 --> 00:42:36,948
Okay.

469
00:42:37,328 --> 00:42:38,548
And excuse me, I have a question.

470
00:42:38,588 --> 00:42:43,150
I listen that this program is only for high school, not for middle school.

471
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:43,430
Yes.

472
00:42:43,991 --> 00:42:45,551
Currently only high school.

473
00:42:46,031 --> 00:42:49,013
We are looking to add middle school at some point.

474
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:54,095
There's an information session that I'll be attending and we're going to get more information, but that is the intent.

475
00:42:55,422 --> 00:43:16,675
because my son is in the last year of the of the middle school and he's going to be in the high school the next year but um can he uh can he join the high school he's almost in the last year oh i don't know can i go in last i don't know i think it's very interesting uh about this from like i didn't know

476
00:43:17,862 --> 00:43:23,706
Yeah, so I would say at this point, middle school unified sports is not going to be implemented this year.

477
00:43:23,966 --> 00:43:25,828
So he would join the high school team next year.

478
00:43:27,069 --> 00:43:32,172
I put in a lot of programs in the med for recreation about basketball.

479
00:43:32,232 --> 00:43:33,513
It's more the clinics.

480
00:43:33,633 --> 00:43:35,375
I put in all the clinics over there.

481
00:43:35,875 --> 00:43:43,961
And not only does one help him for the high school, he has certain idea about how to play basketball.

482
00:43:46,205 --> 00:43:48,787
So the Metro Recreation is separate from this.

483
00:43:49,027 --> 00:43:50,368
I know, I know.

484
00:43:51,309 --> 00:43:53,670
So I'm not quite sure what they do over there.

485
00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:56,693
And, you know, maybe that's something I, Melanie, we can talk about too.

486
00:43:56,933 --> 00:43:59,875
I'm a little bit out of tune with what goes on over there.

487
00:44:00,956 --> 00:44:04,338
But, you know, like I said, it's for students of all abilities.

488
00:44:04,438 --> 00:44:08,581
So if your student wants to join next year, absolutely.

489
00:44:08,601 --> 00:44:10,963
He can play next year at the high school level.

490
00:44:12,264 --> 00:44:20,106
And sorry about, I'm with Jamil too about, my son didn't change a lot of information about the school.

491
00:44:20,166 --> 00:44:22,306
Sometimes they send me emails, sometimes doesn't.

492
00:44:22,687 --> 00:44:28,268
It's hard for me, I always ask for, they can send me to me because he doesn't share information.

493
00:44:28,888 --> 00:44:31,449
Like about the dance, like it's going to be the next week.

494
00:44:31,889 --> 00:44:36,270
I know for my daughter, you know, for, okay, that's not true.

495
00:44:36,370 --> 00:44:38,250
I received the email, I received the email.

496
00:44:39,451 --> 00:44:40,591
Okay, that's it, sorry, thanks.

497
00:44:41,579 --> 00:44:54,429
And I just wanted to add, if I could quickly, the Medford Recreation, we're actually, again, this is part of the Behavioral Health Special Education Subcommittee work because community is part of the life of the school and community for our students.

498
00:44:54,509 --> 00:45:03,736
And so we are establishing a meeting with Medford Recreation and the mayor, currently scheduled for November 17th at 5.30 p.m.

499
00:45:04,096 --> 00:45:08,920
If you can join us, it's gonna be likely via Zoom and or in-person or hybrid.

500
00:45:09,538 --> 00:45:11,719
If you wanna join us, that would be great to have families there.

501
00:45:11,759 --> 00:45:26,248
We are advocating for additional funding for Medford Recreation to have more inclusive integrative programming, because right now they have pretty much two adaptive classes and about 20 or so other classes.

502
00:45:26,328 --> 00:45:36,434
And the reality is with the Americans with Disabilities Act, students with disabilities are of course entitled to go to any of the classes and there should be supports across all of them.

503
00:45:36,834 --> 00:45:38,855
And the adaptive program is really wonderful and great.

504
00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:42,751
And we want to make sure that that is highlighted.

505
00:45:42,811 --> 00:45:55,096
But you know, we also want to make sure that we're not creating subseparate programming, which further divides our kids instead of being integrated or inclusive, or integrated and inclusive and unified.

506
00:45:55,537 --> 00:45:58,198
So that's part of the work we'll be doing with the mayor November 17.

507
00:45:58,238 --> 00:46:03,640
We have a meeting with Metro rec several families are already coming if you'd like to come please email me and

508
00:46:04,041 --> 00:46:07,602
we can talk again about how we're moving this work forward.

509
00:46:07,622 --> 00:46:11,844
But I think the exciting thing, and I don't want people to lose sight of the fact that it's happening, right?

510
00:46:11,884 --> 00:46:14,705
How long have we been wanting this and looking for it?

511
00:46:14,825 --> 00:46:15,866
And it's happening now, right?

512
00:46:15,886 --> 00:46:16,966
We have adaptive programming.

513
00:46:17,286 --> 00:46:18,707
We have a rec department, first of all.

514
00:46:19,207 --> 00:46:20,448
Now we have adaptive programming.

515
00:46:21,468 --> 00:46:23,429
And we'll get to inclusive and integrated.

516
00:46:23,449 --> 00:46:26,450
And we have the unified sports and adaptive PE.

517
00:46:26,610 --> 00:46:28,871
And this is the first year for that.

518
00:46:28,991 --> 00:46:30,812
And it just means it's gonna grow and get better.

519
00:46:30,872 --> 00:46:33,273
So I'm excited about the change that's afoot.

520
00:46:35,685 --> 00:46:36,486
I think we all are.

521
00:46:38,147 --> 00:46:42,952
Can I just chime in and say we use the adaptive services at the rec department a lot for my second grader.

522
00:46:43,412 --> 00:46:49,277
And for those with littler kids that aren't at the unified sports level, it is a really good program.

523
00:46:49,317 --> 00:46:58,285
And when they can, they will also do push in services to the generalized classes as well, which has really helped my kid access those classes.

524
00:46:58,886 --> 00:46:59,406
That's great.

525
00:47:00,007 --> 00:47:00,107
Yeah.

526
00:47:03,978 --> 00:47:06,440
Krista, will you be able to come to that meeting on the 17th?

527
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:09,023
Yeah, I just wrote down email Melanie to go to that meeting.

528
00:47:09,083 --> 00:47:10,144
Okay.

529
00:47:12,386 --> 00:47:13,347
Melanie, I'll try to come too.

530
00:47:13,367 --> 00:47:15,309
We did adaptive swim this summer and it was...

531
00:47:16,528 --> 00:47:19,350
Mostly great, so I will have that little caveat.

532
00:47:19,370 --> 00:47:20,130
It was mostly great.

533
00:47:20,550 --> 00:47:25,873
But my daughter, who's also in second grade, has done Medford Youth Girls Softball.

534
00:47:25,974 --> 00:47:27,534
She did it in the spring, and she's doing it again.

535
00:47:28,215 --> 00:47:32,477
And so she's the only kid, certainly with Down syndrome, on her team.

536
00:47:32,637 --> 00:47:34,418
And it's been a phenomenal experience.

537
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:37,300
The coach has been spectacular.

538
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:42,423
He and I had a 45-minute conversation in the spring just so he could learn about how to coach her.

539
00:47:43,924 --> 00:47:45,565
It's been fabulous.

540
00:47:45,925 --> 00:47:48,969
So I just so excited about the unified sports.

541
00:47:48,989 --> 00:47:58,200
I mean, she's obviously a long way out of high school, but I think about these girls kind of, you know, playing with her again when they're all in high school together and it just, I'm thrilled.

542
00:47:58,380 --> 00:47:59,942
So thank you Carla for that.

543
00:48:00,801 --> 00:48:01,461
Super exciting.

544
00:48:01,502 --> 00:48:10,007
And Carla, I guess I just want to add one of the things that I used to be really sort of against like adaptive stuff, because I wanted Gracie to be able to just be able to be with the other kids.

545
00:48:10,047 --> 00:48:12,168
And I thought, you know, she has the right to be with the other kids.

546
00:48:12,188 --> 00:48:12,948
And of course she does.

547
00:48:13,028 --> 00:48:17,611
But she also deserves the scaffolding and the supports to be able to teach her how to do that.

548
00:48:17,671 --> 00:48:22,394
And that's really a big piece of adaptive PE and adaptive programming.

549
00:48:22,474 --> 00:48:30,459
And Shanine Peliquin, who used to be with EMARC, now Communitas, and is a community member in Medford and works really hard towards inclusion.

550
00:48:30,803 --> 00:48:40,526
was the person that really helped me understand that, that adaptive is about building a bridge to be able to support kids in the community in all kinds of settings.

551
00:48:40,586 --> 00:48:43,647
So I think it's really great to be able to look at it that way.

552
00:48:47,628 --> 00:48:48,989
Sarah, you have another question?

553
00:48:50,029 --> 00:48:52,830
Can I make a fast comment about that?

554
00:48:53,458 --> 00:49:02,364
summer recreation, I put my son in the golf clinics, no, in the soccer clinics from summer recreation.

555
00:49:02,444 --> 00:49:05,786
And they was like regular kids.

556
00:49:05,967 --> 00:49:11,230
And I talked with the trainer and they accept him.

557
00:49:11,430 --> 00:49:14,292
And he was doing, you know, kind of okay.

558
00:49:15,053 --> 00:49:17,354
Because when everybody go right, he went left.

559
00:49:17,895 --> 00:49:19,616
When he went left, everybody go right.

560
00:49:19,696 --> 00:49:21,697
But it was a good experience for him.

561
00:49:23,098 --> 00:49:27,441
hope that can happen over here in all the programs we met.

562
00:49:27,781 --> 00:49:28,101
That's it.

563
00:49:28,341 --> 00:49:28,682
Thank you.

564
00:49:30,082 --> 00:49:30,643
Thanks, Sarah.

565
00:49:30,663 --> 00:49:35,546
All right.

566
00:49:35,586 --> 00:49:38,868
Does anybody else have any questions or anything that they want to add?

567
00:49:39,068 --> 00:49:39,989
Carla, do you have any?

568
00:49:41,032 --> 00:49:43,954
Um, no, just thank you for letting me share this information.

569
00:49:43,994 --> 00:49:45,816
I'm really, I'm really passionate about it.

570
00:49:46,076 --> 00:49:50,500
Um, you know, I, I love working with kids with disabilities.

571
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:51,440
That's my passion.

572
00:49:51,501 --> 00:49:53,262
And then my other passion is athletics.

573
00:49:53,482 --> 00:49:57,906
So, um, it coming together is really kind of a dream situation for me.

574
00:49:57,946 --> 00:49:59,387
So I'm, I'm really excited about it.

575
00:49:59,407 --> 00:50:03,250
And I'm probably going to continue just to spread that excitement every chance I get.

576
00:50:03,310 --> 00:50:06,833
So wherever you need me to present this information, I will do it.

577
00:50:08,827 --> 00:50:09,287
That's awesome.

578
00:50:09,307 --> 00:50:14,631
I think we all feel the same way about how great a program it is and that we're excited we have it now.

579
00:50:14,751 --> 00:50:18,914
And thank you to everybody that made that possible, including Nellie.

580
00:50:18,934 --> 00:50:23,238
And how lucky Medford is to have you, Carla, and how much we appreciate you.

581
00:50:23,258 --> 00:50:23,958
Thank you.

582
00:50:24,018 --> 00:50:25,059
And the work you're doing.

583
00:50:25,219 --> 00:50:34,866
And all of you, Denise and Joan, and we know we're preaching to the choir when we're talking about inclusive practice.

584
00:50:36,987 --> 00:50:39,529
and meaningful inclusion for our kids.

585
00:50:39,610 --> 00:50:42,492
So it's nice to be able to work together toward that end.

586
00:50:42,552 --> 00:50:45,655
And thank you CPAC for all you do.

587
00:50:48,137 --> 00:50:49,318
Wouldn't have done it without you, Mel.

588
00:50:51,921 --> 00:50:52,321
Team.

589
00:50:52,561 --> 00:50:53,062
Literally.

590
00:50:53,082 --> 00:50:53,422
Team.

591
00:50:54,824 --> 00:50:56,025
And Jamil, we got you.

592
00:50:56,425 --> 00:50:58,347
We got your back, girl, okay?

593
00:51:00,747 --> 00:51:03,910
I'm sending out an email right literally as we talk.

594
00:51:03,970 --> 00:51:04,911
I'm sending out an email.

595
00:51:04,931 --> 00:51:06,572
So, and I'll touch base.

596
00:51:06,612 --> 00:51:07,993
I'll circle back as well.

597
00:51:08,013 --> 00:51:15,200
It is tough to get my kid to, I mean, some of you guys are talking about how excited your kids are to participate in sports.

598
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:18,383
My kid's like, nothing but bad things are going to happen.

599
00:51:18,732 --> 00:51:24,057
So do you even get him to the point where he might want to try something?

600
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:32,426
And then when I don't find out about it, or I hear that there's other things that have been put in place and I never even was told, it just makes me feel like, oh, there's just no way to get my kid involved.

601
00:51:32,486 --> 00:51:34,307
And he'll just sit in front of a computer for the rest of his life.

602
00:51:34,908 --> 00:51:39,733
And- I know, I've been scarred for life over dodge ball, Jamil, so I can totally identify with Courtney.

603
00:51:39,913 --> 00:51:41,154
I ain't going out there.

604
00:51:42,644 --> 00:51:50,427
I'm still traumatized by the little... I'm still traumatized by the little outfit I had to wear in gym class when I was in school.

605
00:51:51,647 --> 00:51:53,428
And trying to climb a rope, seriously?

606
00:51:53,528 --> 00:51:54,528
Oh my God.

607
00:51:54,608 --> 00:52:00,470
Or having to like sweaty, try to get ready for your next class, like without taking showers, how gross that was.

608
00:52:00,530 --> 00:52:00,750
Yeah.

609
00:52:03,531 --> 00:52:06,512
And so Joan, when you say you don't, you know, if you don't hear anything, you assume I'm getting it.

610
00:52:07,172 --> 00:52:09,653
I don't know how to tell you anything because I don't know what I don't know.

611
00:52:10,033 --> 00:52:13,414
So I don't know how we can communicate for me to tell you that I'm not getting anything.

612
00:52:13,734 --> 00:52:20,316
I would say after a few days, if you're not inundated with emails, no, and I'm not joking.

613
00:52:20,417 --> 00:52:22,557
It will be inundated.

614
00:52:22,597 --> 00:52:26,979
You need to call me or email me and say three days.

615
00:52:28,299 --> 00:52:30,820
I'm telling you, be careful what you wish for.

616
00:52:31,521 --> 00:52:31,921
You know what?

617
00:52:32,081 --> 00:52:34,462
I already get inundated by so many other people.

618
00:52:34,502 --> 00:52:35,222
I can handle it.

619
00:52:35,482 --> 00:52:41,165
I'm telling you, if after three days you don't receive something, I need to know.

620
00:52:41,265 --> 00:52:43,886
I will continue to fight for this for you.

621
00:52:43,986 --> 00:52:45,227
I promise you.

622
00:52:45,407 --> 00:52:50,189
On Monday, if I don't have a lot of emails before Monday, you'll get an email from me saying I have not heard anything.

623
00:52:50,229 --> 00:52:51,409
That's what I need you to do.

624
00:52:51,669 --> 00:52:51,950
Okay.

625
00:52:52,030 --> 00:52:52,370
Thank you.

626
00:52:52,470 --> 00:52:52,750
Okay.

627
00:52:56,395 --> 00:53:00,979
All right, I think that we have, I don't see any more questions from folks.

628
00:53:00,999 --> 00:53:02,440
I think we're good.

629
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:06,263
The dog behaved and the Red Sox are losing six to nothing.

630
00:53:06,303 --> 00:53:11,748
So, I mean, it really, both things that were of concern ended up like, not really.

631
00:53:11,948 --> 00:53:12,989
Yeah, blah.

632
00:53:13,269 --> 00:53:23,297
And then, can I just add, if you guys are going to the Unified tomorrow, I'm planning on going, if you're going, you know, take pictures, share on social media, invite your, you know,

633
00:53:24,718 --> 00:53:40,169
candidates, your representatives, your whatever people that put it out there on social media, maybe someone consider writing something for the patch or, you know, the transcript, it's really good to get the word out and to celebrate this in our community and let people really understand the pride that comes in this.

634
00:53:40,389 --> 00:53:44,112
And I'm excited to watch how the kids interact with each other tomorrow.

635
00:53:44,172 --> 00:53:48,254
And, you know, Gracie's funny, because she's like, I was telling her that we were going to go today.

636
00:53:48,274 --> 00:53:49,735
And she was like, No, no, no.

637
00:53:49,795 --> 00:53:51,957
And I said, you know, it's not today, it's tomorrow.

638
00:53:52,017 --> 00:53:52,077
And

639
00:53:52,675 --> 00:54:00,679
I'm still trying to get that concept and everything's right now, which in a way can be a good thing, being mindful, I guess, in the moment.

640
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:07,362
But I was saying, you know, tomorrow, and then she finally agreed that she would go, but then it was like, but I wanna play.

641
00:54:07,382 --> 00:54:11,584
And I was like, you're not playing, you're watching.

642
00:54:11,604 --> 00:54:20,489
So we will see how that all goes tomorrow, but you know, I'm just gonna, you know, roll with it, take it in stride and, you know, let her enjoy and have fun.

643
00:54:21,202 --> 00:54:28,186
One of the things that I think we really need to encourage and celebrate is the beauty of imperfection among all of us.

644
00:54:28,226 --> 00:54:32,028
So I look forward to seeing you guys in whatever state tomorrow.

645
00:54:33,729 --> 00:54:34,390
You're going to love it.

646
00:54:35,110 --> 00:54:37,071
I'm sure you're really going to love it.

647
00:54:37,211 --> 00:54:43,115
It is so much fun to watch and I can't wait to see how much the students have grown in their skills.

648
00:54:43,561 --> 00:54:46,042
from the first game to this game.

649
00:54:46,082 --> 00:54:50,124
I didn't go to the one in Malden, but I'm telling you, they are so excited.

650
00:54:50,344 --> 00:54:54,826
Everyone cheers for one another when they make a basket, when they don't make a basket.

651
00:54:54,846 --> 00:55:00,148
I mean, it's just a great way to end the day.

652
00:55:00,208 --> 00:55:12,633
And I will say that the kids that joined that don't have disabilities, I will say that at the Malden game, and Carla, you probably saw this too, one of the students that played on the Malden team

653
00:55:13,933 --> 00:55:26,436
that did not have a disability, was standing next to one of the Medford team members that did have a disability, guiding her on how to shoot from where she was.

654
00:55:26,796 --> 00:55:31,837
So it's really, it's everybody's in it for the right reasons.

655
00:55:32,258 --> 00:55:33,018
That's awesome.

656
00:55:33,138 --> 00:55:35,698
And I did invite the, what time, how long does it last?

657
00:55:35,778 --> 00:55:36,519
I invited the mayor.

658
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:38,899
An hour, just like an hour.

659
00:55:39,139 --> 00:55:42,600
Yeah, I sent out that email to the world, so I'm hoping that they all come.

660
00:55:43,065 --> 00:55:47,568
Yeah, I invited the mayor, but she teaches, she does girls on the run tomorrow.

661
00:55:47,648 --> 00:55:48,809
So she said she wouldn't be done till 4.30.

662
00:55:49,530 --> 00:55:55,574
So she was wondering how long it lasts, but you know, I'll try to do, maybe I'll do some Facebook live to share with folks.

663
00:55:55,834 --> 00:55:59,537
And then also, you know, I'm inviting the candidates too.

664
00:55:59,637 --> 00:56:03,980
So, you know, that's always interesting because they'll post.

665
00:56:05,622 --> 00:56:06,102
All right.

666
00:56:06,402 --> 00:56:07,183
Thanks guys.

667
00:56:07,885 --> 00:56:08,846
Well, thanks, everybody.

668
00:56:08,886 --> 00:56:11,427
Carla, thank you so much for sharing this information.

669
00:56:11,587 --> 00:56:12,087
And you know what?

670
00:56:12,127 --> 00:56:20,812
We can also do kind of an ad hoc update at some point as you kind of get into the assessment part of things in November.

671
00:56:20,832 --> 00:56:21,753
Absolutely.

672
00:56:21,833 --> 00:56:25,155
And just to kind of keep track and see where it's going.

673
00:56:26,442 --> 00:56:32,047
Yeah, I think we'll be doing a school committee presentation to they wanted an update at some point.

674
00:56:32,688 --> 00:56:39,415
You know how many referrals that so we'll get that together and be able to present it to CPAC and also to school committee.

675
00:56:40,255 --> 00:56:45,040
Yeah, and tell everybody you know and have everybody come to the game, because representation is important.

676
00:56:46,541 --> 00:56:50,045
And we don't want to be a crock pot recipe right said it and forget it.

677
00:56:51,216 --> 00:56:52,636
This is, this is great.

678
00:56:52,876 --> 00:56:55,857
And honestly, this has been so informative.

679
00:56:56,157 --> 00:57:00,439
And the passion that I'm hearing is it's infectious, and it's very cool.

680
00:57:00,679 --> 00:57:01,139
Thank you.

681
00:57:02,039 --> 00:57:02,439
Thank you.

682
00:57:03,019 --> 00:57:03,619
Thanks, everyone.

683
00:57:03,639 --> 00:57:06,340
We're going to give you back about a half hour of your night.

684
00:57:07,481 --> 00:57:08,021
Thank you.

685
00:57:08,121 --> 00:57:08,881
Thanks for joining.

686
00:57:08,921 --> 00:57:10,041
Thanks, everyone.

687
00:57:10,761 --> 00:57:11,542
Six working.

688
00:57:11,622 --> 00:57:12,782
Thanks.

689
00:57:13,082 --> 00:57:14,142
Bye.

690
00:57:15,043 --> 00:57:15,343
Bye.

691
00:57:15,403 --> 00:57:16,083
Thank you.

692
00:57:16,143 --> 00:57:16,403
Bye.
