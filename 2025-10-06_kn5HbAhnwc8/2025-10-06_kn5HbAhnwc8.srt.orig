1
00:00:00,192 --> 00:00:01,195
do do

2
00:00:26,187 --> 00:00:32,851
[SPEAKER_01]: The founder will be coming to the mic to talk with you a little bit about the festival itself.

3
00:00:33,391 --> 00:00:39,475
[SPEAKER_01]: But I just wanted to tell you a little bit about the West Medford Community Center for those of you that have never been here before.

4
00:00:43,537 --> 00:00:48,320
[SPEAKER_01]: In the city of Medford, the African American community goes back to

5
00:00:49,380 --> 00:01:01,251
[SPEAKER_01]: the late 1800s, and when that community began, there were only three streets where the African Americans who settled here could live.

6
00:01:01,852 --> 00:01:06,096
[SPEAKER_01]: One was Arlington, the street that you're on now, the next street over

7
00:01:06,676 --> 00:01:10,820
[SPEAKER_01]: Lincoln Street and then the street over behind that was Jerome Street.

8
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:23,611
[SPEAKER_01]: And because of redlining and because of unspoken or unwritten covenants from the city fathers, those were the only places where property would be available to people of color.

9
00:01:23,711 --> 00:01:28,776
[SPEAKER_01]: So this became the heart of the black community in Medford.

10
00:01:29,376 --> 00:01:34,620
[SPEAKER_01]: and became one of the nicest places in Massachusetts for people of color to live.

11
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:40,243
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was spoken about across the nation, this community, West Medford.

12
00:01:40,984 --> 00:01:47,828
[SPEAKER_01]: Those of us who have lived here for a very long time, as I have, I was born and raised here, we actually call it The Ville.

13
00:01:48,128 --> 00:01:55,113
[SPEAKER_01]: We get in trouble with the people from Somerville sometimes, because they say, why you call it, it doesn't have anything to do with West, well, you know.

14
00:01:55,393 --> 00:01:57,696
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, we call it The Village.

15
00:01:57,797 --> 00:01:59,299
[SPEAKER_01]: Short, essentially, for The Village.

16
00:02:00,901 --> 00:02:09,733
[SPEAKER_01]: But Jonathan and I, and we'll actually be playing tomorrow as the Ally Project with Greg Toro and Gordon Engelgau,

17
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:15,472
[SPEAKER_01]: We got together at the intersection of jazz and social justice.

18
00:02:15,993 --> 00:02:19,535
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just so happens that that intersection is here in West Medford.

19
00:02:20,195 --> 00:02:27,220
[SPEAKER_01]: So the community center that you're in now is 90 years old, not this building itself.

20
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:33,288
[SPEAKER_01]: But the idea, it started in 1934 with the West Medford Men's Club.

21
00:02:34,209 --> 00:02:37,654
[SPEAKER_01]: And once the women got involved, they had to change that.

22
00:02:37,714 --> 00:02:43,281
[SPEAKER_01]: So then it became the West Medford Community Club, and it was actually

23
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:50,426
[SPEAKER_01]: chartered and a building was brought here in 1945.

24
00:02:51,126 --> 00:02:53,447
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna step away for just a second.

25
00:02:53,467 --> 00:02:54,947
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll try to stay just as loud.

26
00:02:55,507 --> 00:03:06,970
[SPEAKER_01]: But this little army barracks right here, this depiction, that's the old Quonset hut that was brought here on a truck from East Boston and built on the site.

27
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,430
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was the first building.

28
00:03:08,851 --> 00:03:14,832
[SPEAKER_01]: This replaced that building about 20 years ago and has always been the place where

29
00:03:15,974 --> 00:03:20,641
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, where folks from the neighborhood go to do just about anything, everything.

30
00:03:22,525 --> 00:03:28,234
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was a kid we used to come here, Boy Scouts, basketball,

31
00:03:30,112 --> 00:03:34,555
[SPEAKER_01]: making models, learning how to cook, parties on Friday nights.

32
00:03:35,276 --> 00:03:38,058
[SPEAKER_01]: All things happened here at the community center.

33
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:41,160
[SPEAKER_01]: On the top row, there are 28 pictures.

34
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,721
[SPEAKER_01]: That's called the West Medford Elder Photo Project.

35
00:03:44,162 --> 00:03:48,565
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of those folks have passed away, but several of them are still here with us.

36
00:03:50,046 --> 00:03:54,508
[SPEAKER_01]: 16 and 17 is my uncle, Bill and Rachel Tanner.

37
00:03:54,548 --> 00:03:56,190
[SPEAKER_01]: They're still with us, fortunately.

38
00:03:56,210 --> 00:04:04,315
[SPEAKER_01]: Number four is my dad, so if you pass by and you see a guy that looks like me, only an older version, you know, that's who he is.

39
00:04:04,895 --> 00:04:17,383
[SPEAKER_01]: And we love the place, as you can see along the lower part of the wall, that's the West Medford Elder, excuse me, Afro-American Remembrance Project, and that really tells a contemporary history of West Medford.

40
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:22,035
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have a chance, just take a quick scan and see what you're looking at.

41
00:04:22,075 --> 00:04:24,216
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're in for a treat tonight.

42
00:04:25,737 --> 00:04:28,778
[SPEAKER_01]: And Jonathan's going to come and tell you a little bit more about that.

43
00:04:29,219 --> 00:04:41,064
[SPEAKER_01]: And we certainly hope that you'll come back Saturday and Sunday because we think that the festival is going to be, as the kids like to say, off the chains this year.

44
00:04:41,084 --> 00:04:44,206
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully you'll be back to take another look.

45
00:04:46,029 --> 00:04:47,552
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple different things.

46
00:04:48,834 --> 00:04:51,499
[SPEAKER_01]: Please turn your cell phones on silent or off.

47
00:04:53,341 --> 00:05:08,809
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are mics, pickup mics scattered around, so if you can kind of guard against ambient noise, we don't necessarily want everything that's said to go into the recording.

48
00:05:09,989 --> 00:05:18,954
[SPEAKER_01]: I just do want to thank Jonathan Fagan for partnering with the West Memphis Community Center to bring the festival here.

49
00:05:19,014 --> 00:05:20,795
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been here for six years now,

50
00:05:21,235 --> 00:05:22,135
[SPEAKER_01]: Five, six years now?

51
00:05:22,475 --> 00:05:23,556
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, five years now.

52
00:05:23,796 --> 00:05:27,157
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's getting bigger and better every year.

53
00:05:27,977 --> 00:05:30,998
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're really, really thrilled to have you here with us.

54
00:05:31,718 --> 00:05:35,799
[SPEAKER_01]: But Jonathan's going to come and talk a little bit more about who's playing tonight.

55
00:05:35,819 --> 00:05:37,220
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'll come back and do the same.

56
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:43,602
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

57
00:05:43,662 --> 00:05:44,622
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks so much, Terry.

58
00:05:44,642 --> 00:05:46,222
[SPEAKER_02]: You beat me to the punch on, oh.

59
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,561
[SPEAKER_02]: We can hear you.

60
00:05:49,581 --> 00:05:50,801
[SPEAKER_02]: You can hear me.

61
00:05:50,921 --> 00:05:51,622
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what counts.

62
00:05:53,363 --> 00:05:58,386
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Terry beat me to the punch on a lot of the things about this place and the history of this festival.

63
00:05:58,426 --> 00:06:03,389
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just wanted to take a few minutes and give some thank yous to the people that have helped put this together.

64
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,751
[SPEAKER_02]: For those of you I haven't met, my name is Jonathan Fagan.

65
00:06:06,811 --> 00:06:08,672
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a pianist and composer.

66
00:06:08,873 --> 00:06:12,555
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll go into that mode tomorrow, playing with Terry in the Ally Project.

67
00:06:12,655 --> 00:06:15,377
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it's hard to believe that we've been doing this.

68
00:06:15,597 --> 00:06:17,058
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been the primary producer of this,

69
00:06:18,122 --> 00:06:23,524
[SPEAKER_02]: my partner Shayla for the last five years or so, started in 2020 as a virtual festival.

70
00:06:23,544 --> 00:06:26,866
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't a great year for live music, as you remember.

71
00:06:28,186 --> 00:06:33,188
[SPEAKER_02]: Over at Bop Stop Studios in West Medford, or no, not West Medford, just near Medford Square.

72
00:06:35,724 --> 00:06:39,065
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's amazing that it's grown into the live event that it is today.

73
00:06:39,325 --> 00:06:46,427
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the second year that we're doing what we call a student night, just where adults that are getting back into playing get to share their talents with each other.

74
00:06:47,127 --> 00:06:52,368
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you very much to Morningside Music Studio, and especially to Peter for organizing that piece of it.

75
00:06:52,388 --> 00:06:55,709
[SPEAKER_02]: There's actually not one, but two groups.

76
00:06:56,169 --> 00:07:01,090
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'd say one and a half, because some of the pieces will change and some of them will stay the same.

77
00:07:02,823 --> 00:07:11,011
[SPEAKER_02]: And to Anita, who's really taken off in a big way through this jam session circuit and put together a stellar group for the second half of this.

78
00:07:11,191 --> 00:07:18,659
[SPEAKER_02]: So, looking forward to hearing you and thanks so much for all your time and sharing your talents.

79
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:22,832
[SPEAKER_02]: I do want to thank a couple of people that have helped this year.

80
00:07:22,972 --> 00:07:26,895
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like this has been a team effort more than any time in the past.

81
00:07:27,616 --> 00:07:30,878
[SPEAKER_02]: First, we have a couple new people, and I know that one of them couldn't make it tonight.

82
00:07:31,478 --> 00:07:38,703
[SPEAKER_02]: Lauren Garcia has been doing a lot of our social media this year, so anything you see on Facebook and Instagram, I live under a rock.

83
00:07:39,724 --> 00:07:40,865
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know anything about that.

84
00:07:42,566 --> 00:07:45,988
[SPEAKER_02]: If you see anything there, big shout out to Lauren for her help.

85
00:07:46,909 --> 00:07:53,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Also to our newest intern, who's a new master's student at Berklee College of Music, and that's Reese Pike.

86
00:07:54,233 --> 00:07:57,715
[SPEAKER_02]: You're gonna hear her in a little while.

87
00:07:57,755 --> 00:08:04,660
[SPEAKER_02]: Wonderful player, and has just been really saving me in a variety of ways already, so thank you to Reese.

88
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,441
[SPEAKER_02]: Also to my partner, Shayla.

89
00:08:06,461 --> 00:08:10,043
[SPEAKER_02]: She's done just about everything, you know, as far

90
00:08:13,742 --> 00:08:18,367
[SPEAKER_02]: A huge thank you for all your help with both promotion and day of management.

91
00:08:18,407 --> 00:08:22,492
[SPEAKER_02]: She'll be here the whole weekend helping out with various things.

92
00:08:23,983 --> 00:08:30,084
[SPEAKER_02]: And last of all, to Terry Carter, who has really made this community center the home of the Medford Jazz Festival.

93
00:08:31,005 --> 00:08:39,846
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been reflecting, especially over the past couple weeks, it's more than a festival now, it's really the story of this community, which is what it's all about.

94
00:08:39,946 --> 00:08:51,429
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a cultural celebration of all of the things that have happened here, the people that still live around here and attend, and has just become so meaningful on a variety of levels.

95
00:08:51,469 --> 00:08:52,869
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you so much to Terry.

96
00:08:57,915 --> 00:09:03,997
[SPEAKER_02]: Last, the people that are working sound and cameras add a lot to the whole production value.

97
00:09:04,037 --> 00:09:06,737
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got Jim over there, back with Medford Community Media.

98
00:09:09,538 --> 00:09:10,979
[SPEAKER_02]: And Bruce, who's jumped right in.

99
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:19,341
[SPEAKER_02]: And to Avi Fagan, who happens to be my dad, who's running the set.

100
00:09:19,801 --> 00:09:23,702
[SPEAKER_02]: I say that this is one of the few times he comes out of retirement, so we really appreciate that.

101
00:09:28,368 --> 00:09:32,572
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think, Terry, you said everything I was going to say about the community center itself.

102
00:09:33,133 --> 00:09:37,277
[SPEAKER_02]: The last thing I'll say is that we get a lot of support by generous sponsors.

103
00:09:38,478 --> 00:09:44,184
[SPEAKER_02]: So all these organizations have either given money or discounts on things that we've needed.

104
00:09:44,985 --> 00:09:47,128
[SPEAKER_02]: First, the West Medford Community Center for the Space.

105
00:09:48,067 --> 00:09:55,172
[SPEAKER_02]: The Arts Alive Medford Foundation, Morningside Music Studio, obviously, for the musicians that they've sent our way.

106
00:09:56,033 --> 00:09:57,074
[SPEAKER_02]: Medford Arts Council.

107
00:09:58,054 --> 00:10:04,539
[SPEAKER_02]: This year we actually have a food vendor for the Saturday and the Sunday of the festival in the Danish Pastry House.

108
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:08,162
[SPEAKER_02]: And we may or may not have sampled a couple things the other day.

109
00:10:08,222 --> 00:10:09,383
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty delicious.

110
00:10:09,903 --> 00:10:10,383
[SPEAKER_02]: Come back.

111
00:10:10,904 --> 00:10:14,306
[SPEAKER_02]: You will enjoy it immensely.

112
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:21,589
[SPEAKER_02]: For, to Triangle Manor, which is a local t-shirt company that printed our banner and our t-shirts.

113
00:10:21,629 --> 00:10:24,310
[SPEAKER_02]: They look great, we just unpacked them a couple hours ago.

114
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:31,753
[SPEAKER_02]: To Berkeley's Institute for Jazz and Gender Justice, which is run by a famous drummer, Terry Lynn Carrington.

115
00:10:32,453 --> 00:10:35,795
[SPEAKER_02]: She's been sending some young alumni over here every year, past couple years.

116
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:37,775
[SPEAKER_02]: They always do a fantastic job.

117
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:44,178
[SPEAKER_02]: To all of our Patreon members, which is, it's Patreon for those of you who don't know, I didn't know.

118
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:47,790
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a total, well, I live under a rock, as I said.

119
00:10:48,891 --> 00:10:55,395
[SPEAKER_02]: Patreon is a crowdfunding platform, but it runs as a subscription, so a few dollars every month.

120
00:10:55,995 --> 00:10:57,856
[SPEAKER_02]: We all have too many subscriptions, what's one more?

121
00:10:57,876 --> 00:11:11,405
[SPEAKER_02]: But actually, it really helps, because that allows us to run jam sessions throughout the year, to hire musicians to play as part of the house band, and give students and professionals opportunities to interact with each other.

122
00:11:11,865 --> 00:11:13,947
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of those happen right here at the community center.

123
00:11:14,368 --> 00:11:19,092
[SPEAKER_02]: We've also started having some over at Arts Collaborative Medford and other venues around the city.

124
00:11:19,172 --> 00:11:24,837
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're especially inspired by what we do, please consider signing up for that Patreon list.

125
00:11:25,438 --> 00:11:28,020
[SPEAKER_02]: It's added a lot to what we're able to accomplish.

126
00:11:28,981 --> 00:11:32,585
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, there's also conveniently placed donation links.

127
00:11:33,215 --> 00:11:36,297
[SPEAKER_02]: with Venmo QR codes and we have cash boxes.

128
00:11:37,077 --> 00:11:42,740
[SPEAKER_02]: Events like this are, you know, we love to keep them free and open to the public, but free events are not actually free.

129
00:11:43,961 --> 00:11:47,603
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can always use some more crowd support.

130
00:11:48,563 --> 00:11:53,186
[SPEAKER_02]: Last, to Medford Community Media for the awesome video that you guys do.

131
00:11:54,947 --> 00:12:00,970
[SPEAKER_02]: To EXP Realty and Alan L. Pierce to Staples for printing our programs.

132
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:04,711
[SPEAKER_02]: And lastly, to the Winchester Community Music School.

133
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:16,536
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll talk a little bit in between groups about some of the music schools that are around this area that have supported us, and I'm hoping that we can support them by sending some students your way.

134
00:12:16,756 --> 00:12:19,397
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that, I'll turn it over to Morningside.

135
00:12:22,757 --> 00:12:24,438
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so much I could say about Morningside.

136
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:33,203
[SPEAKER_02]: It was one of the first places that I taught when I got back to this area, but there's so many dedicated adult students that have really inspired us to kind of keep

137
00:12:34,474 --> 00:12:36,215
[SPEAKER_02]: providing opportunities to play.

138
00:12:36,535 --> 00:12:39,836
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm really looking forward to hearing what they have.

139
00:12:39,856 --> 00:12:41,737
[SPEAKER_02]: They have not one again, but two groups.

140
00:12:42,077 --> 00:12:44,078
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to switch out rhythm sections in the middle.

141
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:49,140
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually, you'll get to hear Debbie Lane on vocals with both.

142
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:53,041
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that, this is The Morningside Jazz All-Stars.

143
00:12:53,801 --> 00:13:01,664
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Jonathan.

144
00:13:01,724 --> 00:13:02,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Terry.

Bye!

00:18:34,361 --> 00:18:39,289
Thank you so much.

148
00:18:50,624 --> 00:18:58,371
[SPEAKER_04]: In this last couple of summers, we shouldn't take a clear day for granted, so we wanted to start off on a clear day.

149
00:18:58,811 --> 00:19:08,739
[SPEAKER_04]: So tonight we're playing a mix of standards and what I call 21st century tunes by newer folks, and vocals, vocal tunes with Debbie Lang, who'll be up in a minute.

150
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:15,485
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a tune called Biro Kirosai by the late Jim Rotondi, great trumpet player.

151
00:19:30,973 --> 00:19:36,875
One, two, three.

152
00:20:08,535 --> 00:20:08,716

00:25:52,474 --> 00:25:57,438
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to keep up the pace with a Frank Foster tune called Simone.

157
00:27:13,793 --> 00:27:13,873

158
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:47,330

00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:23,522
[SPEAKER_04]: We have such fun rehearsing above the Regent Theater on various nights of the week.

161
00:33:23,642 --> 00:33:27,884
[SPEAKER_04]: It's nice to come together, get out, walk across the river, and here we are.

162
00:33:27,904 --> 00:33:31,166
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have far to go.

163
00:33:31,906 --> 00:33:38,769
[SPEAKER_04]: But we do have farther to go musically, and I want to introduce Mike Chamness on the drums.

[SPEAKER_04]: And Mike Sack on tenor.

167

[SPEAKER_04]: My trusted partner.

00:34:02,015 --> 00:34:02,535
[SPEAKER_04]: The wisdom.

169
00:34:04,176 --> 00:34:10,882
[SPEAKER_04]: And at this time, we have a special shift in course as we invite the wonderful Debbie Lane to come up.

170
00:34:16,013 --> 00:34:21,909
[SPEAKER_05]: And I actually want to introduce Peter Orn, who's been an amazing leader for this whole experience.

171
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:47,240
[SPEAKER_05]: So this song is by the wonderful Antonio Carlos Jobim.

00:47:50,317 --> 00:48:15,687
[SPEAKER_08]: Imagination is funny It makes a cloudy day sunny Makes a bee think of honey Just as I think of you Imagination is crazy

223
00:48:17,582 --> 00:48:44,468
[SPEAKER_08]: Your whole perspective gets hazy Starts you asking a daisy What to do, what to do Have you ever felt a gentle touch And then a kiss, and then, and then

224
00:48:47,715 --> 00:49:11,412
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell me your imagination again Oh well, imagination is silly You go around willy nilly For example, I go around

225
00:49:17,332 --> 00:49:24,237
[SPEAKER_08]: And yet I can't imagine that you want me too

226
00:51:19,447 --> 00:51:21,830

227
00:51:48,202 --> 00:52:11,775
[SPEAKER_08]: have you ever felt a gentle touch and then a kiss and then and then find it's only your imagination again oh well, imagination is silly

228
00:52:13,849 --> 00:52:23,277
[SPEAKER_08]: You go around willy-nilly Or except I go around

229
00:52:28,612 --> 00:52:35,275
[SPEAKER_08]: And yet I can't imagine that you want me.

230
00:52:35,935 --> 00:52:40,357
[SPEAKER_08]: Can't imagine that you want me.

231
00:52:41,297 --> 00:52:46,579

[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

233
00:53:01,315 --> 00:53:10,658
[SPEAKER_05]: So this next song is a jazz classic by, I just put a little side note that my family is here and their last name is Golson, not related to Benny Golson who wrote this song.

234
00:53:11,658 --> 00:53:12,319
[SPEAKER_05]: As far as I know.

235
00:53:14,059 --> 00:53:20,381
[SPEAKER_05]: Check it out.

236
00:53:20,621 --> 00:53:21,442
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you related?

237
00:53:21,522 --> 00:53:25,483
[SPEAKER_06]: And this song's called Whisper Not.

238
00:53:43,938 --> 00:53:45,278
Sing low, sing clear

239
00:54:05,970 --> 00:54:27,217
[SPEAKER_08]: sweet words in my ear not a whisper of despair but love's own prayer sing on until you bring back the thrill

240
00:54:28,513 --> 00:54:56,070
[SPEAKER_08]: Of a sentimental tune That died too soon Our harmony was lost But you forgave I forgot Whisper not of quarrels past You know we've had our last So now

241
00:55:03,814 --> 00:55:08,718
[SPEAKER_08]: Love will whisper on eternally

242
00:56:07,103 --> 00:56:09,925
[SPEAKER_05]: We'd miss her when they said it wouldn't last.

243
00:56:11,446 --> 00:56:15,508
[SPEAKER_05]: Dissident voices made us break up, but you know we still can make up.

244
00:56:16,949 --> 00:56:21,032
[SPEAKER_08]: Forget them all, and answer Cupid's call.

245
00:56:22,092 --> 00:56:22,993
[SPEAKER_08]: Is this a dream?

246
00:56:24,334 --> 00:56:27,516
[SPEAKER_08]: Was this a trouble or an echo of the past?

247
00:56:29,088 --> 00:56:57,479
[SPEAKER_08]: It will take to lose my gloom It's just a whisper, not a rumor But of your love for me That's how it's got to be Our harmony was lost But you forgave I forgot Whisper not of woe's bad You know we've had a laugh

248
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:12,809
[SPEAKER_08]: constantly love will whisper on eternally

249
00:57:43,373 --> 00:57:49,046
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to continue with a few more instrumentals to bring us up to about 715 or so.

[SPEAKER_01]: We love, in West Medford, and probably where you're from as well, I don't mean to single us out, but in West Medford, we really love homecomings, okay?

270
01:12:15,604 --> 01:12:21,928
[SPEAKER_01]: We love reunions, we love backyard barbecues, we love all of that kind of stuff that gets the family together.

271

[SPEAKER_01]: And Anita Wood is a homegirl, as we like to say.

272

273
01:12:37,741 --> 01:12:51,152
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyways, so she's got this very cool collective that she's been jamming with for a little while now, trying to get that sound down that they like, jazz standards, often with a twist of passion.

274
01:12:52,814 --> 01:12:56,257

433
02:10:29,521 --> 02:10:35,423
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so glad that I ended up running into you a bunch last year and that you could make this happen.

434
02:10:35,503 --> 02:10:38,744
[SPEAKER_02]: So seriously, it's a fantastic way to just...

435
02:10:40,044 --> 02:10:41,525
[SPEAKER_02]: just start a whole celebration.

436
02:10:41,565 --> 02:10:46,588
[SPEAKER_02]: And also remember that there's so many different ways that you can make music with other people.

[SPEAKER_02]: I remember, I think you were just starting to kind of come in on the jam session circuit when I ran into you over in Winchester.

438
02:10:53,873 --> 02:10:57,715
[SPEAKER_02]: And just to see how much you've kind of developed in that time is really incredible.

441
02:11:12,332 --> 02:11:18,357
[SPEAKER_02]: In addition to an area rich with talent, I really feel lucky that there are so many great community music school programs around here.

442
02:11:18,717 --> 02:11:19,898
[SPEAKER_02]: Morningside being one of them.

443
02:11:19,998 --> 02:11:23,341
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan Fox, who's out of town at the moment, I mean he's a busy guy, what can he do?

444
02:11:24,362 --> 02:11:31,168
[SPEAKER_02]: But he's put together some really amazing ensembles and a lot of these students have been there for years and years and just keep getting better.

447
02:11:49,335 --> 02:12:01,900
