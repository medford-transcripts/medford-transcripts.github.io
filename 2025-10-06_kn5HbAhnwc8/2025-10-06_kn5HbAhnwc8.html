    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=26.187s">The</a>  founder will be coming to the mic to talk with you a little bit about the festival itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=33.391s">But</a>  I just wanted to tell you a little bit about the West Medford Community Center for those of you that have never been here before. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=43.537s">In</a>  the city of Medford, the African American community goes back to <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=49.38s">the</a>  late 1800s, and when that community began, there were only three streets where the African Americans who settled here could live. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=61.852s">One</a>  was Arlington, the street that you're on now, the next street over <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=66.676s">Lincoln</a>  Street and then the street over behind that was Jerome Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=71.26s">And</a>  because of redlining and because of unspoken or unwritten covenants from the city fathers, those were the only places where property would be available to people of color. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=83.711s">So</a>  this became the heart of the black community in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=89.376s">and</a>  became one of the nicest places in Massachusetts for people of color to live. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=95.56s">And</a>  it was spoken about across the nation, this community, West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=100.984s">Those</a>  of us who have lived here for a very long time, as I have, I was born and raised here, we actually call it The Ville. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=108.128s">We</a>  get in trouble with the people from Somerville sometimes, because they say, why you call it, it doesn't have anything to do with West, well, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=115.393s">Anyways,</a>  we call it The Village. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=117.797s">Short,</a>  essentially, for The Village. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=120.901s">But</a>  Jonathan and I, and we'll actually be playing tomorrow as the Ally Project with Greg Toro and Gordon Engelgau, <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=132.07s">We</a>  got together at the intersection of jazz and social justice. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=135.993s">And</a>  it just so happens that that intersection is here in West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=140.195s">So</a>  the community center that you're in now is 90 years old, not this building itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=147.62s">But</a>  the idea, it started in 1934 with the West Medford Men's Club. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=154.209s">And</a>  once the women got involved, they had to change that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=157.714s">So</a>  then it became the West Medford Community Club, and it was actually <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=165.625s">chartered</a>  and a building was brought here in 1945. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=171.126s">I'm</a>  gonna step away for just a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=173.467s">I'll</a>  try to stay just as loud. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=175.507s">But</a>  this little army barracks right here, this depiction, that's the old Quonset hut that was brought here on a truck from East Boston and built on the site. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=187.03s">And</a>  that was the first building. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=188.851s">This</a>  replaced that building about 20 years ago and has always been the place where <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=195.974s">you</a>  know, where folks from the neighborhood go to do just about anything, everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=202.525s">When</a>  I was a kid we used to come here, Boy Scouts, basketball, <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=210.112s">making</a>  models, learning how to cook, parties on Friday nights. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=215.276s">All</a>  things happened here at the community center. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=218.518s">On</a>  the top row, there are 28 pictures. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=221.2s">That's</a>  called the West Medford Elder Photo Project. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=224.162s">Many</a>  of those folks have passed away, but several of them are still here with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=230.046s">16</a>  and 17 is my uncle, Bill and Rachel Tanner. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=234.548s">They're</a>  still with us, fortunately. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=236.21s">Number</a>  four is my dad, so if you pass by and you see a guy that looks like me, only an older version, you know, that's who he is. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=244.895s">And</a>  we love the place, as you can see along the lower part of the wall, that's the West Medford Elder, excuse me, Afro-American Remembrance Project, and that really tells a contemporary history of West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=258.133s">So</a>  if you have a chance, just take a quick scan and see what you're looking at. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=262.075s">But</a>  you're in for a treat tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=265.737s">And</a>  Jonathan's going to come and tell you a little bit more about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=269.219s">And</a>  we certainly hope that you'll come back Saturday and Sunday because we think that the festival is going to be, as the kids like to say, off the chains this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=281.084s">So</a>  hopefully you'll be back to take another look. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=286.029s">A</a>  couple different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=288.834s">Please</a>  turn your cell phones on silent or off. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=293.341s">And</a>  there are mics, pickup mics scattered around, so if you can kind of guard against ambient noise, we don't necessarily want everything that's said to go into the recording. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=309.989s">I</a>  just do want to thank Jonathan Fagan for partnering with the West Medford Community Center to bring the festival here. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=319.014s">We've</a>  been here for six years now, <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=321.235s">Five,</a>  six years now? <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=322.475s">Yeah,</a>  five years now. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=323.796s">And</a>  it's getting bigger and better every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=327.977s">So</a>  we're really, really thrilled to have you here with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=331.718s">But</a>  Jonathan's going to come and talk a little bit more about who's playing tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=335.819s">And</a>  then I'll come back and do the same.</p>

    <p>[Jonathan Fagan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=337.24s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=343.662s">Thanks</a>  so much, Terry. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=344.642s">You</a>  beat me to the punch on, oh. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=348.5s">We</a>  can hear you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=349.581s">You</a>  can hear me. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=350.921s">That's</a>  what counts. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=353.363s">Yeah,</a>  Terry beat me to the punch on a lot of the things about this place and the history of this festival. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=358.426s">But</a>  I just wanted to take a few minutes and give some thank yous to the people that have helped put this together. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=364.25s">For</a>  those of you I haven't met, my name is Jonathan Fagan. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=366.811s">I'm</a>  a pianist and composer. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=368.873s">I'll</a>  go into that mode tomorrow, playing with Terry in the Ally Project. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=372.655s">But</a>  yeah, it's hard to believe that we've been doing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=375.597s">I've</a>  been the primary producer of this, <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=378.122s">my</a>  partner Shayla for the last five years or so, started in 2020 as a virtual festival. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=383.544s">It</a>  wasn't a great year for live music, as you remember. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=388.186s">Over</a>  at Bop Stop Studios in West Medford, or no, not West Medford, just near Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=395.724s">And</a>  it's amazing that it's grown into the live event that it is today. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=399.325s">This</a>  is the second year that we're doing what we call a student night, just where adults that are getting back into playing get to share their talents with each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=407.127s">So</a>  thank you very much to Morningside Music Studio, and especially to Peter for organizing that piece of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=412.388s">There's</a>  actually not one, but two groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=416.169s">Well,</a>  I'd say one and a half, because some of the pieces will change and some of them will stay the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=422.823s">And</a>  to Anita, who's really taken off in a big way through this jam session circuit and put together a stellar group for the second half of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=431.191s">So,</a>  looking forward to hearing you and thanks so much for all your time and sharing your talents. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=439.71s">I</a>  do want to thank a couple of people that have helped this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=442.972s">I</a>  feel like this has been a team effort more than any time in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=447.616s">First,</a>  we have a couple new people, and I know that one of them couldn't make it tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=451.478s">Lauren</a>  Garcia has been doing a lot of our social media this year, so anything you see on Facebook and Instagram, I live under a rock. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=459.724s">I</a>  don't know anything about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=462.566s">If</a>  you see anything there, big shout out to Lauren for her help. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=466.909s">Also</a>  to our newest intern, who's a new master's student at Berklee College of Music, and that's Reese Pike. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=474.233s">You're</a>  gonna hear her in a little while. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=477.755s">Wonderful</a>  player, and has just been really saving me in a variety of ways already, so thank you to Reese. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=485.2s">Also</a>  to my partner, Shayla. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=486.461s">She's</a>  done just about everything, you know, as far <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=493.742s">A</a>  huge thank you for all your help with both promotion and day of management. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=498.407s">She'll</a>  be here the whole weekend helping out with various things. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=503.983s">And</a>  last of all, to Terry Carter, who has really made this community center the home of the Medford Jazz Festival. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=511.005s">I've</a>  been reflecting, especially over the past couple weeks, it's more than a festival now, it's really the story of this community, which is what it's all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=519.946s">It's</a>  a cultural celebration of all of the things that have happened here, the people that still live around here and attend, and has just become so meaningful on a variety of levels. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=531.469s">So</a>  thank you so much to Terry. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=537.915s">Last,</a>  the people that are working sound and cameras add a lot to the whole production value. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=544.037s">We've</a>  got Jim over there, back with Medford Community Media. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=549.538s">And</a>  Bruce, who's jumped right in. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=551.959s">And</a>  to Avi Fagan, who happens to be my dad, who's running the set. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=559.801s">I</a>  say that this is one of the few times he comes out of retirement, so we really appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=568.368s">And</a>  I think, Terry, you said everything I was going to say about the community center itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=573.133s">The</a>  last thing I'll say is that we get a lot of support by generous sponsors. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=578.478s">So</a>  all these organizations have either given money or discounts on things that we've needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=584.985s">First,</a>  the West Medford Community Center for the Space. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=588.067s">The</a>  Arts Alive Medford Foundation, Morningside Music Studio, obviously, for the musicians that they've sent our way. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=596.033s">Medford</a>  Arts Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=598.054s">This</a>  year we actually have a food vendor for the Saturday and the Sunday of the festival in the Danish Pastry House. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=604.919s">And</a>  we may or may not have sampled a couple things the other day. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=608.222s">It's</a>  pretty delicious. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=609.903s">Come</a>  back. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=610.904s">You</a>  will enjoy it immensely. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=615.907s">For,</a>  to Triangle Manor, which is a local t-shirt company that printed our banner and our t-shirts. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=621.629s">They</a>  look great, we just unpacked them a couple hours ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=625.291s">To</a>  Berkeley's Institute for Jazz and Gender Justice, which is run by a famous drummer, Terry Lynn Carrington. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=632.453s">She's</a>  been sending some young alumni over here every year, past couple years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=636.415s">They</a>  always do a fantastic job. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=638.596s">To</a>  all of our Patreon members, which is, it's Patreon for those of you who don't know, I didn't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=644.728s">I'm</a>  a total, well, I live under a rock, as I said. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=648.891s">Patreon</a>  is a crowdfunding platform, but it runs as a subscription, so a few dollars every month. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=655.995s">We</a>  all have too many subscriptions, what's one more? <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=657.876s">But</a>  actually, it really helps, because that allows us to run jam sessions throughout the year, to hire musicians to play as part of the house band, and give students and professionals opportunities to interact with each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=671.865s">A</a>  lot of those happen right here at the community center. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=674.368s">We've</a>  also started having some over at Arts Collaborative Medford and other venues around the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=679.172s">So</a>  if you're especially inspired by what we do, please consider signing up for that Patreon list. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=685.438s">It's</a>  added a lot to what we're able to accomplish. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=688.981s">And</a>  of course, there's also conveniently placed donation links. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=693.215s">with</a>  Venmo QR codes and we have cash boxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=697.077s">Events</a>  like this are, you know, we love to keep them free and open to the public, but free events are not actually free. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=703.961s">So</a>  we can always use some more crowd support. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=708.563s">Last,</a>  to Medford Community Media for the awesome video that you guys do. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=714.947s">To</a>  EXP Realty and Alan L. Pierce to Staples for printing our programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=721.77s">And</a>  lastly, to the Winchester Community Music School. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=724.891s">I'll</a>  talk a little bit in between groups about some of the music schools that are around this area that have supported us, and I'm hoping that we can support them by sending some students your way. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=736.756s">So</a>  with that, I'll turn it over to Morningside. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=742.757s">There's</a>  so much I could say about Morningside. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=744.458s">It</a>  was one of the first places that I taught when I got back to this area, but there's so many dedicated adult students that have really inspired us to kind of keep <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=754.474s">providing</a>  opportunities to play. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=756.535s">And</a>  I'm really looking forward to hearing what they have. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=759.856s">They</a>  have not one again, but two groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=762.077s">They're</a>  going to switch out rhythm sections in the middle. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=764.138s">And</a>  actually, you'll get to hear Debbie Lane on vocals with both. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=769.3s">So</a>  with that, this is The Morningside Jazz All-Stars. <a href="https://youtu.be/kn5HbAhnwc8&t=773.801s">Thank</a>  you, Jonathan.</p>
