00:08:29,981 --> 00:08:30,742
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome before us.

166
00:08:30,942 --> 00:08:35,766
[SPEAKER_06]: I will go to councilor Scarpelli of licensing and permitting and science subcommittee.

167
00:08:45,404 --> 00:08:51,710
[SPEAKER_09]: what we're looking for, so you can explain, yes, Dance, what you were asking for tonight.

168
00:09:12,455 --> 00:09:22,138
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I'd like to help the gentleman, but if we can't ask, I think we should table this until we get further information.

169
00:09:22,158 --> 00:09:28,880
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that we hate to move forward if we don't, he doesn't understand what we're asking as well.

170
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:29,340
[SPEAKER_09]: So sure.

171
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,440
[SPEAKER_09]: Is your partner coming tonight?

172
00:09:39,347 --> 00:09:39,968
[SPEAKER_06]: 30 or 40 minutes.

173
00:09:40,568 --> 00:09:40,848
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

174
00:09:41,048 --> 00:09:44,991
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, we can put it, can I step aside and maybe call him and does he, does he speak English?

175
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:46,491
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe I step aside.

176
00:09:46,511 --> 00:09:46,852
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that okay?

177
00:09:46,892 --> 00:09:47,312
[SPEAKER_06]: That works?

178
00:09:47,352 --> 00:09:47,592
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

179
00:09:47,632 --> 00:09:49,793
[SPEAKER_09]: If we can just move it aside so I can talk to him.

180
00:09:49,894 --> 00:09:50,074
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

181
00:09:50,114 --> 00:09:50,234
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

182
00:09:50,254 --> 00:09:54,336
[SPEAKER_06]: If you can get him on the phone, Councilor, he misses the meeting.

183
00:09:54,356 --> 00:09:58,639
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause I know what we push this aside a few times and we want to get it forward if we can.

184
00:09:58,739 --> 00:09:59,359
[SPEAKER_06]: So great.

185
00:09:59,439 --> 00:09:59,699
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

186
00:09:59,719 --> 00:10:00,460
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scarpelli.

187
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:00,640
[SPEAKER_09]: Um,

188
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:15,726
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is open if we just want a motion to, we could recess or we could table and then take it back up, whatever folks would prefer.

189
00:10:16,206 --> 00:10:18,227
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion to table for later in the meeting.

190
00:10:20,089 --> 00:10:22,570
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to table, Councilor Leming, seconded by Councilor Tseng.

191
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,411
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

192
00:10:32,176 --> 00:10:32,776
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Callahan.

193
00:10:32,976 --> 00:10:33,137
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

194
00:10:33,597 --> 00:10:34,377
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice President Collins.

195
00:10:35,158 --> 00:10:35,318
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

196
00:10:37,315 --> 00:10:37,976
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Lazzaro?

197
00:10:38,196 --> 00:10:38,417
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

198
00:10:38,898 --> 00:10:39,418
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Luebman?

199
00:10:39,659 --> 00:10:39,859
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

200
00:10:41,261 --> 00:10:42,844
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Scarpelli is briefly absent.

201
00:10:43,305 --> 00:10:44,206
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Tseng? President Bears??

202
00:10:44,867 --> 00:10:44,967
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

203
00:10:44,987 --> 00:10:45,408
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Bears?

204
00:10:45,688 --> 00:10:45,909
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

205
00:10:45,989 --> 00:10:47,371
[SPEAKER_06]: Six in the affirmative, one absent.

206
00:10:48,012 --> 00:10:49,334
[SPEAKER_06]: We are temporarily tabling this.

207
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:52,220
[SPEAKER_06]: Motions, orders, and resolutions.

208
00:10:53,701 --> 00:11:15,019
[SPEAKER_06]: 24474 offered by Councilor Lazzaro, resolution to discuss Tufts University's decision to disinvest from the Neighborhood Fellows Program, be it resolved, whereas Tufts University benefits from many services offered by the City of Medford, the City of Somerville, and other surrounding cities, while participating in the pilot Payment in Lieu of Taxes Program, with the understanding that the community benefits from educational programs offered by Tufts University,

209
00:11:15,479 --> 00:11:21,220
[SPEAKER_06]: be it resolved that the City Council discuss the potential negative impact of the disinvestment in the Neighborhood Fellows Program at Tufts University.

210
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:21,920
[SPEAKER_06]: Council Lizara.

211
00:11:22,801 --> 00:11:23,261
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

212
00:11:23,281 --> 00:11:37,064
[SPEAKER_02]: Our city participates in the pilot program with Tufts University, which is an agreement where Tufts pays a portion.

213
00:11:39,464 --> 00:11:42,645
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead of taxes, it pays fees to the city.

214
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:48,465
[SPEAKER_02]: that do not equal the amount of money that they would pay were they to pay property taxes.

215
00:11:49,105 --> 00:11:59,176
[SPEAKER_02]: But there is an exchange of services, significant services offered by Tufts and significant services offered by the city.

216
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:04,421
[SPEAKER_02]: I learned recently that Tufts decided to

217
00:12:05,962 --> 00:12:08,564
[SPEAKER_02]: take a pause on their Neighborhood Fellows Program.

218
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:28,938
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the participants this year is Chelli Keshavan, who is a very active community member in Medford, who brought it to my attention and asked that we ask Tufts, or a representative from Tufts to come and speak to us and explain the situation.

219
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:34,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody from Tufts was available tonight, but I do have a statement from Brock Roderico, who is the

220
00:12:36,383 --> 00:12:47,834
[SPEAKER_02]: government and community relations executive director at Tufts University, which I'm going to read the email he sent me sort of explaining the agreement with Tufts that we enjoy.

221
00:12:49,556 --> 00:12:55,182
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, as we discussed, Tufts University provides many payments programs and services to Medford residents.

222
00:12:55,883 --> 00:12:58,085
[SPEAKER_02]: The neighborhood fellows program is not one of those programs.

223
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:01,442
[SPEAKER_02]: It is open to applicants, regardless of where they live.

224
00:13:01,723 --> 00:13:07,347
[SPEAKER_02]: This program is not part of the pilot agreement or the community benefits report that we provide to the city.

225
00:13:07,528 --> 00:13:09,289
[SPEAKER_02]: Most participants do not live in Medford.

226
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:15,715
[SPEAKER_02]: Tufts University pays $1,426,148 in property taxes each year.

227
00:13:16,355 --> 00:13:19,598
[SPEAKER_02]: In addition, this is for buildings that are like housing.

228
00:13:21,079 --> 00:13:25,483
[SPEAKER_02]: In addition to those property tax payments, we also make an annual payment in lieu of taxes pilot.

229
00:13:26,246 --> 00:13:33,311
[SPEAKER_02]: in the amount of $450,000 to the city of Medford, and we report all our community benefits to our Medford-Somerville Community Benefits Report.

230
00:13:34,092 --> 00:13:36,814
[SPEAKER_02]: Those benefits come to more than $6 million each year.

231
00:13:37,234 --> 00:13:39,636
[SPEAKER_02]: A copy of the report can be found on our website.

232
00:13:39,796 --> 00:13:41,097
[SPEAKER_02]: We did share that link.

233
00:13:42,278 --> 00:13:48,663
[SPEAKER_02]: For the Joyce Cummings Center on College Avenue, Tufts University pays an annual pilot payment of $250,000 each year.

234
00:13:49,244 --> 00:13:53,447
[SPEAKER_02]: The Starbucks in the JCC also generates property tax revenue for Medford.

235
00:13:55,402 --> 00:14:08,176
[SPEAKER_02]: So I did also want to invite some folks from the Neighborhood Fellows Program to speak on the program and what is happening.

236
00:14:08,216 --> 00:14:13,062
[SPEAKER_02]: When I spoke with Rocco, he did say that the plan

237
00:14:14,275 --> 00:14:28,601
[SPEAKER_02]: as of now, was for them to pause enrollment in the program temporarily, allow the folks that are enrolled right now to finish the program, and then reassess how acceptances would work going forward.

238
00:14:29,361 --> 00:14:35,564
[SPEAKER_02]: I have had meetings with current and former participants in the program, which it's a very interesting program.

239
00:14:35,584 --> 00:14:37,905
[SPEAKER_02]: It's how it works right now,

240
00:14:39,014 --> 00:15:02,463
[SPEAKER_02]: is that people are accepted into the program as mid-career, like active community organizers, people who are change makers, who kind of come in and get a master's in public policy through Tufts University while they're actively leading in their communities.

241
00:15:02,604 --> 00:15:06,205
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people are from the Boston area, Chelli is from Medford,

242
00:15:07,369 --> 00:15:13,651
[SPEAKER_02]: But people are from Boston, Somerville, Cambridge, all around the region, Lawrence.

243
00:15:14,532 --> 00:15:18,733
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are people who are actively leading in their communities.

244
00:15:18,773 --> 00:15:21,834
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very diverse program in many ways.

245
00:15:22,774 --> 00:15:26,436
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's something that may be discontinued, maybe not.

246
00:15:26,696 --> 00:15:28,276
[SPEAKER_02]: It's unclear right now.

247
00:15:28,336 --> 00:15:29,297
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sort of in flux.

248
00:15:29,517 --> 00:15:32,638
[SPEAKER_02]: But members of the program who are

249
00:15:34,161 --> 00:15:50,768
[SPEAKER_02]: part of the program right now and former members of the program, but alumni of the program, were interested in, I think that by the nature of who they are, because they're community activists, are trying to talk about ways to continue the program, keep it alive.

250
00:15:51,088 --> 00:15:59,091
[SPEAKER_02]: And I thought it was especially prudent that we discuss it because it's a program that cultivates

251
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:03,692
[SPEAKER_02]: stronger and better leadership in the community.

252
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:18,944
[SPEAKER_02]: And even if it is not officially listed as part of the community benefits that Medford gets from the pilot program, I do think it is a valuable program for our community and our surrounding communities.

253
00:16:19,933 --> 00:16:26,196
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but I would, I would, uh, offer that, uh, if there is somebody from the program, it would be nice to hear from them.

254
00:16:26,756 --> 00:16:26,956
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks.

255
00:16:26,976 --> 00:16:28,137
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll go to members of the council first.

256
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:31,078
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyone from the council have any comments on this paper?

257
00:16:31,358 --> 00:16:31,578
[SPEAKER_06]: I do.

258
00:16:31,898 --> 00:16:32,699
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scarpelli.

259
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:34,660
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, thank you for bringing this forward Councilor Lazzaro.

260
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:44,584
[SPEAKER_09]: I did talk to, uh, to, uh, Mr. DiRico and they are in full support of finding other mechanisms to make, to bring this program, uh,

261
00:16:45,702 --> 00:16:47,104
[SPEAKER_09]: and make it whole again in the future.

262
00:16:47,124 --> 00:16:58,013
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that being that it isn't part of our agreement, it is a Tufts University policy that they're trying to really move forward.

263
00:16:58,033 --> 00:17:01,636
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that what he did mention that it is one person from Medford.

264
00:17:02,737 --> 00:17:08,822
[SPEAKER_09]: And one thing that I was happy about that those people that are enrolled right now will still have the full scholarship,

265
00:17:09,212 --> 00:17:10,773
[SPEAKER_09]: and we'll finish the program in whole.

266
00:17:11,213 --> 00:17:13,194
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's a piece that I thought was very important.

267
00:17:14,054 --> 00:17:23,779
[SPEAKER_09]: But again, some of the people that were enrolled are, I think New Bedford, he mentioned some people out of the country, out of state.

268
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:35,565
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's a very diverse group that Tufts offers this program, but you do come across, as he said, Tufts University would love to do everything, but with the process and understanding

269
00:17:36,816 --> 00:17:40,258
[SPEAKER_09]: paid tuition, free tuition, and finding that balance.

270
00:17:40,298 --> 00:17:44,261
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's what Tufts is really trying to find to make sure that this moves forward.

271
00:17:44,301 --> 00:17:58,292
[SPEAKER_09]: So, again, I don't, what I, the message I received from Morocco is that they are, they will look high and low to make sure that this will continue, but it definitely needs a pause right now.

272
00:17:58,772 --> 00:18:00,673
[SPEAKER_09]: so they can come back on stronger footing.

273
00:18:01,073 --> 00:18:12,175
[SPEAKER_09]: So, um, and like again, I said, I know that there is one person from Medford and my biggest fear was if we're cutting this program with that person, not be able to fill what they started.

274
00:18:12,215 --> 00:18:13,896
[SPEAKER_09]: And he said, absolutely not there.

275
00:18:14,156 --> 00:18:15,416
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody that's in the program right now.

276
00:18:15,436 --> 00:18:23,058
[SPEAKER_09]: I think he said it was five that are all going to move forward and all going to finish with the, uh, what they promised with Tufts promise.

277
00:18:23,078 --> 00:18:24,538
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you, Mr. President.

278
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:25,379
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

279
00:18:25,399 --> 00:18:26,879
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to know vice president Collins.

280
00:18:29,684 --> 00:18:34,780
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, President Bears appreciate the Councilor for bringing this forward and for the discussion so far.

281
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:41,432
[SPEAKER_21]: Very happy to see the council taking this issue up this evening.

282
00:18:41,452 --> 00:18:55,782
[SPEAKER_21]: I think it is very important that we do publicly appreciate and acknowledge Tufts University when it does things that are positive for our community and, you know, show that partnership.

283
00:18:56,203 --> 00:19:03,608
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think it's just as important for us to take note when it is missing opportunities to invest in our public sector.

284
00:19:04,549 --> 00:19:19,271
[SPEAKER_21]: In the way that is in the spirit of the payment in lieu of tax relationship that we do have with the university I think that this is an important thing for us to advocate around specifically because it is not a part of our pilot agreement and we know that you know the

285
00:19:20,748 --> 00:19:33,656
[SPEAKER_21]: kind of the point of the pilot agreement is that it is not equivalent to what Tufts would be investing in Medford if Tufts was a regular property taxpayer, like every other property taxpayer in the city of Medford.

286
00:19:34,516 --> 00:19:43,642
[SPEAKER_21]: I think it's significant that this is one of, through this Neighborhood Fellows program, I think this is a really important program to call out because

287
00:19:44,162 --> 00:20:04,108
[SPEAKER_21]: what it does in an intangible way is it empowers people in communities, including Medford and like Medford around the greater Boston area, to become people who can be more and more effective at investing and managing and developing public sectors and being changemakers in the public sector.

288
00:20:04,128 --> 00:20:05,789
[SPEAKER_21]: And so I think it's

289
00:20:06,906 --> 00:20:21,776
[SPEAKER_21]: It's been meaningful in the past that Tufts has chosen to extend this into our communities, and especially because Tufts and other tax-exempt nonprofits like it do not have to invest in a public sector the way that everybody else does.

290
00:20:23,657 --> 00:20:32,062
[SPEAKER_21]: I hope that we can take them at their word when they say that they are trying to bring this back expeditiously, but that's not something that we have to take them at their word.

291
00:20:32,943 --> 00:20:36,185
[SPEAKER_21]: I think we need to advocate for it, and I hope that we can see this

292
00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:40,590
[SPEAKER_21]: program returned to its full strength very quickly.

293
00:20:40,911 --> 00:20:52,395
[SPEAKER_21]: And while we remain in discussion with them around that, just to add our voice to the chorus to say we can see how meaningful this has been for students that come from Medford and our neighboring communities.

294
00:20:53,315 --> 00:21:04,920
[SPEAKER_21]: And it's an important piece of that puzzle when it comes to making the city whole for all of the benefits that Tufts and other tax exempt nonprofits receive from being in our community.

295
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:05,860
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

296
00:21:07,469 --> 00:21:07,909
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

297
00:21:08,049 --> 00:21:09,911
[SPEAKER_06]: Any further discussion by members of the council?

298
00:21:09,931 --> 00:21:17,837
[SPEAKER_06]: I do have a question or two for Rocco that I wasn't going to bring up, but then he brought him up, so I'm going to ask him.

299
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:23,502
[SPEAKER_06]: Would anyone mind making an amendment to the paper to the effect of my questions?

300
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:27,225
[SPEAKER_06]: And Councilor Lazzaro, would you mind communicating them to him since he sent you an email?

301
00:21:28,005 --> 00:21:28,786
[SPEAKER_02]: I would be happy to.

302
00:21:28,846 --> 00:21:29,587
[SPEAKER_02]: I would make the amendment.

303
00:21:30,147 --> 00:21:30,487
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks.

304
00:21:30,648 --> 00:21:33,530
[SPEAKER_06]: I would just request that we ask for more details on

305
00:21:35,799 --> 00:21:37,940
[SPEAKER_06]: how often the pilot agreement is negotiated.

306
00:21:39,501 --> 00:21:42,762
[SPEAKER_06]: He mentioned a specific amount of property taxes that are paid to the city.

307
00:21:42,782 --> 00:21:45,363
[SPEAKER_06]: I would like to know what entity is paying those.

308
00:21:45,423 --> 00:21:46,644
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it Tufts University?

309
00:21:46,704 --> 00:21:50,505
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it Walnut Hill Properties, their private development arm, or is it some other entity?

310
00:21:52,846 --> 00:21:53,607
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would like to know

311
00:21:55,177 --> 00:22:07,184
[SPEAKER_06]: how they estimate the value of their community benefits and whether the community that they say they're benefiting is involved in determining the value of those benefits or what those benefits actually are.

312
00:22:09,605 --> 00:22:11,386
[SPEAKER_02]: I will say the, if I may.

313
00:22:12,887 --> 00:22:14,888
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

314
00:22:15,508 --> 00:22:22,352
[SPEAKER_02]: The link that was shared has some fairly robust

315
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:25,936
[SPEAKER_02]: estimates and it's available on the Tufts website.

316
00:22:25,976 --> 00:22:29,037
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would encourage folks to take a look.

317
00:22:29,817 --> 00:22:36,220
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a PDF called 2023 Tufts University Community Benefits Report for the cities of Medford and Somerville.

318
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:42,742
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a PDF that maybe we can share as part of the minutes or something.

319
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:49,984
[SPEAKER_02]: But it is, it's a yearly report that I believe Tufts puts out that is the sort of

320
00:22:52,054 --> 00:22:58,219
[SPEAKER_02]: accounting of their estimation of like the exchange.

321
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:17,776
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's fair to say it's like a guess of what that monetary value would be, but it's things like, well, one thing is undergraduate financial aid for students who are from Somerville and Medford, which I think I would argue they would probably give to those students

322
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:24,375
[SPEAKER_02]: In any way, I used to work in financial aid at universities and it was common practice.

323
00:23:24,555 --> 00:23:31,480
[SPEAKER_02]: If you accepted a student, they had to earn that place at the university by being academically viable.

324
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:35,944
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was in the interest of the university to make it possible for the student to attend.

325
00:23:36,464 --> 00:23:42,068
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, I'm not sure that's something that you would necessarily say, but all of these things like there is a monetary value.

326
00:23:42,128 --> 00:23:43,269
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's laid out.

327
00:23:45,014 --> 00:23:54,380
[SPEAKER_02]: But yes, I think those are valid questions and I would motion to include them as a amendment.

328
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:55,500
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

329
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:56,020
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

330
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,882
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate that Councilor Lazzaro, since I can't make amendments from the chair.

331
00:24:00,723 --> 00:24:01,023
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

332
00:24:01,103 --> 00:24:03,285
[SPEAKER_06]: With that, I will go to public participation.

333
00:24:03,345 --> 00:24:08,648
[SPEAKER_06]: If you would like to speak on this item in public participation and you're in the room, you can stand at the podium.

334
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:16,203
[SPEAKER_06]: If you would like to discuss this item and you're on Zoom, please raise your hand on Zoom, and we will alternate between Zoom and in-person comment.

335
00:24:16,623 --> 00:24:23,088
[SPEAKER_06]: Each person who would like to comment will have three minutes, so please raise your hand on Zoom or come to the podium in person.

336
00:24:23,108 --> 00:24:28,331
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, we'll go to the podium first.

337
00:24:29,072 --> 00:24:30,673
[SPEAKER_06]: Please give your name and address for the record.

338
00:24:30,733 --> 00:24:31,694
[SPEAKER_06]: You have three minutes.

339
00:24:33,363 --> 00:24:37,084
[SPEAKER_05]: Josue Perez, 132 Weston Road, Manchester, New Hampshire.

340
00:24:38,845 --> 00:24:42,086
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm here today in my capacity as a reporter for the Tufts Daily.

341
00:24:43,747 --> 00:24:52,630
[SPEAKER_05]: Did Rocco give any like reasoning for why the partnership was or the program was ended?

342
00:24:55,431 --> 00:24:58,512
[SPEAKER_05]: Or is that not something he's like allowed to do this time?

343
00:25:00,785 --> 00:25:06,407
[SPEAKER_02]: He, not no, in sort of.

344
00:25:08,528 --> 00:25:18,833
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, I would speak more, I wouldn't feel comfortable speaking on that because it's not really my, it's not up to me.

345
00:25:19,153 --> 00:25:19,733
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

346
00:25:19,933 --> 00:25:21,814
[SPEAKER_05]: I was wondering if you had shared like anything for?

347
00:25:22,474 --> 00:25:23,135
[SPEAKER_05]: No, not with me.

348
00:25:23,275 --> 00:25:23,495
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

349
00:25:25,958 --> 00:25:30,480
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, and I did have some other questions, but they were answered kind of along the way, so that's all I really have.

350
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:31,020
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

351
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:32,301
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, and thank you for being here.

352
00:25:32,321 --> 00:25:37,603
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to go to Chelli on Zoom.

353
00:25:42,985 --> 00:25:44,766
[SPEAKER_06]: Name and address for the record, you have three minutes.

354
00:25:45,767 --> 00:25:48,788
[SPEAKER_00]: Chelli Keshavan 32 Pearl Street.

355
00:25:48,888 --> 00:25:49,748
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.

356
00:25:51,661 --> 00:25:56,045
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting that for the first time my address is relevant to the content of this discussion.

357
00:25:56,065 --> 00:26:02,470
[SPEAKER_00]: I first want to thank Councilor Lazzaro for her energy and sort of partnership.

358
00:26:03,451 --> 00:26:18,563
[SPEAKER_00]: I and a sort of team members and fellow MPPers, fellow neighborhood fellows and kind of allyship at Tufts have been working through a lot of the semantics of what's gone on with the fellows

359
00:26:19,082 --> 00:26:26,850
[SPEAKER_00]: over the summer, and Emily has really partnered with the goal of listening and understanding, so gratitude for that.

360
00:26:28,472 --> 00:26:38,502
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're sort of here wanting to kind of partner, I guess, with Medford, share what's going on for us at Tufts.

361
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:40,644
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to maybe give a little bit of a recap

362
00:26:41,772 --> 00:26:42,873
[SPEAKER_00]: more on a personal level.

363
00:26:42,993 --> 00:26:47,957
[SPEAKER_00]: I am one of the neighborhood fellows and have very recently kind of wrapped up my degree.

364
00:26:47,977 --> 00:26:52,861
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm joined by some folks on the call today.

365
00:26:52,921 --> 00:27:06,353
[SPEAKER_00]: So Zach, or Councilor Bears, if, I don't know if my colleague Joe might be able to give us a little bit of a background and then maybe I can follow up with some more personal comments after the fact, if that would be okay.

366
00:27:07,689 --> 00:27:12,313
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, yeah, if I tell you, if you could share the comments and then I can go to Joe, is that okay?

367
00:27:12,453 --> 00:27:13,854
[SPEAKER_06]: That's, I just, that's what the rules say.

368
00:27:14,494 --> 00:27:14,874
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.

369
00:27:15,115 --> 00:27:15,355
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.

370
00:27:15,795 --> 00:27:16,235
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.

371
00:27:16,496 --> 00:27:21,079
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, just, I mean, so just to share, um, for folks who don't know, my name is Shelley.

372
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:22,400
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew up in Medford.

373
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:23,861
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been here since 1991.

374
00:27:24,261 --> 00:27:28,104
[SPEAKER_00]: I have grown up on the Tufts campus since 1991.

375
00:27:28,484 --> 00:27:33,128
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, you know, in classes, I sometimes joke that I'm the original neighborhood fellow.

376
00:27:34,396 --> 00:27:39,380
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have faculty leadership that I essentially feel was my conduit.

377
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,944
[SPEAKER_00]: He saw me, he understood that I was ready for a master's program.

378
00:27:43,725 --> 00:27:54,174
[SPEAKER_00]: He also understood that without this fellowship, I had absolutely no financial capacity to make a master's degree happen at this time in my life, despite being academically ready.

379
00:27:54,194 --> 00:27:56,857
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the Neighborhood Fellowship

380
00:27:57,310 --> 00:28:04,754
[SPEAKER_00]: recognizes a potential partnership with the city and also recognizes expertise that local leadership can offer.

381
00:28:06,234 --> 00:28:08,195
[SPEAKER_00]: I am very proud of UEP.

382
00:28:08,315 --> 00:28:14,158
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're fervently, fervent advocates in spaces around racial and economic justice.

383
00:28:14,218 --> 00:28:15,559
[SPEAKER_00]: We are guardians of the people.

384
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:22,703
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to Councilor Lazzaro's points, I think there's nothing but positives that can come from

385
00:28:24,964 --> 00:28:38,006
[SPEAKER_00]: sitting with where the program is, understanding who we want to be in two, five, ten years, and sort of identifying what the steps are to get there and just sort of bolstering what could become a really robust program.

386
00:28:39,367 --> 00:28:43,467
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I don't have, I have nothing negative, I have nothing but good things to say.

387
00:28:43,487 --> 00:28:50,789
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, it is hard to sort of receive, it was difficult to receive the messaging around

388
00:28:52,543 --> 00:28:54,184
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of putting the program on hold.

389
00:28:54,324 --> 00:28:57,145
[SPEAKER_00]: I never wanted to be maybe the last neighborhood fellow.

390
00:28:57,165 --> 00:29:02,728
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm thrilled to be able to have the opportunity to talk with the city about what we could do together.

391
00:29:02,748 --> 00:29:04,049
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.

392
00:29:04,989 --> 00:29:05,649
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Chelly.

393
00:29:05,669 --> 00:29:06,890
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to go to Joe.

394
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:08,611
[SPEAKER_06]: Joe, I'm going to unmute you.

395
00:29:09,211 --> 00:29:10,832
[SPEAKER_06]: Name and address for the record.

396
00:29:11,732 --> 00:29:12,893
[SPEAKER_06]: You have three minutes.

397
00:29:15,034 --> 00:29:15,794
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

398
00:29:15,814 --> 00:29:17,035
[SPEAKER_18]: Can everybody hear me okay?

399
00:29:17,915 --> 00:29:18,135
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

400
00:29:19,356 --> 00:29:19,516
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

401
00:29:20,386 --> 00:29:32,795
[SPEAKER_18]: Joe De Larauze, I live at 22 Dexter Street in Medford, and I'd like to thank the council for receiving us and opening this conversation this evening.

402
00:29:34,896 --> 00:29:47,604
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that Councilor Lazzaro and Shelley gave kind of a good overview of what the Neighborhood Fellows Program represents, so I'll try to stick to giving a little bit of the recent history of the program.

403
00:29:48,105 --> 00:29:49,666
[SPEAKER_18]: But earlier this year,

404
00:29:50,586 --> 00:30:00,073
[SPEAKER_18]: the larger UEP community of which the neighborhood fellows are a part were informed by faculty that the neighborhood fellows program.

405
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:04,896
[SPEAKER_18]: And this without given without much reasoning or without much notice.

406
00:30:06,397 --> 00:30:10,240
[SPEAKER_18]: And they the but the community sort of didn't

407
00:30:11,499 --> 00:30:12,880
[SPEAKER_18]: didn't let that stand.

408
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:40,775
[SPEAKER_18]: They quickly formed a Jumbos for Neighborhood Fellows group to lead various efforts to advocate for the restoration of the program, which included a petition campaign, which gathered over 400 signatures, a letter writing campaign that saw over 50 letters and emails written to the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Dean and Provost, and other events like potlucks and retreat

409
00:30:41,675 --> 00:30:50,260
[SPEAKER_18]: to share information about the Neighborhood Fellows Program and about the larger UEP's community wish to see it continue.

410
00:30:51,801 --> 00:31:01,646
[SPEAKER_18]: So just as we stand now, the Masters in Public Policy of which the Neighborhood Fellows Program is a cohort has been paused.

411
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:07,349
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's hard to not see the connection between the two.

412
00:31:07,369 --> 00:31:10,531
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that now we're in

413
00:31:11,266 --> 00:31:40,528
[SPEAKER_18]: continued discussion with the dean and provost office to make sure that the revisioning committee that was recently appointed to discuss the future of the Neighborhood Fellows Program best represent current and past fellows, the larger UEP community, which has housed the program, and to ensure that adequate steps are taken to further the program that we all feel has significantly contributed to Tufts and to the greater Boston urban leadership community,

414
00:31:41,188 --> 00:31:48,990
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, and that, you know, without, without, you know, significant, uh, support, uh, will likely not continue to be funded.

415
00:31:49,070 --> 00:32:01,654
[SPEAKER_18]: So, uh, yeah, we're here to, to, uh, to really thank the neighborhood fellows, uh, for, for their leadership and for, um, for, for continuing to be leaders both here in Medford, but across the state.

416
00:32:02,434 --> 00:32:02,514
[SPEAKER_18]: Um,

417
00:32:03,034 --> 00:32:11,343
[SPEAKER_18]: If you look at the folks who've been in our program, there are a lot of people who are having a very active role across Massachusetts.

418
00:32:12,584 --> 00:32:17,649
[SPEAKER_18]: So yeah, I think with that, I'll thank you for your time and your attention.

419
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:19,591
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Joe.

420
00:32:21,993 --> 00:32:23,975
[SPEAKER_06]: Any further comments by members of the council?

421
00:32:24,676 --> 00:32:25,257
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Leming.

422
00:32:26,288 --> 00:32:44,413
[SPEAKER_11]: I would like to make a an additional motion to make an additional amendment to the request for information from Mr. DeRocco, which is, I'd just like to know what is the, just what is the estimated value of the

423
00:32:46,033 --> 00:32:56,998
[SPEAKER_11]: taxable, the property that would be taxable on the on the Medford side of the Tufts campus, thereby getting an estimate of how much they would pay in taxes if they weren't exempted from that.

424
00:32:59,339 --> 00:32:59,699
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

425
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:01,980
[SPEAKER_06]: Any further discussion?

426
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:04,582
[SPEAKER_06]: Any objections to the amendment?

427
00:33:06,543 --> 00:33:09,464
[SPEAKER_06]: No, just as long as you accept it as the main sponsor.

428
00:33:09,504 --> 00:33:09,644
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

429
00:33:11,047 --> 00:33:15,210
[SPEAKER_06]: I did have a chance very quickly to look at the community benefits document.

430
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:18,752
[SPEAKER_06]: Over half of the value claimed by Tufts is financial aid.

431
00:33:19,272 --> 00:33:21,113
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not divided by Medford and Somerville.

432
00:33:21,714 --> 00:33:32,280
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not clear how much of that 1.43 million is coming from Walnut Hill, which is a private development arm of the university and not Tufts University itself.

433
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:37,943
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm hoping to get a little bit more clarity from Mr. DeRico in response to our questions.

434
00:33:41,924 --> 00:33:44,686
[SPEAKER_06]: And what's the motion here on the paper at large?

435
00:33:45,066 --> 00:33:46,788
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you like to refer it to a committee or?

436
00:33:46,808 --> 00:33:50,770
[SPEAKER_06]: As amended.

437
00:33:53,772 --> 00:33:56,294
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure that we need to discuss it on committee further.

438
00:33:56,314 --> 00:34:00,737
[SPEAKER_02]: I do think that we could have further conversations with Mr. Jurico.

439
00:34:00,777 --> 00:34:08,042
[SPEAKER_02]: He's our government liaison at the university, and we often have really great discussions.

440
00:34:08,102 --> 00:34:08,762
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a good person.

441
00:34:10,649 --> 00:34:11,470
[SPEAKER_02]: He's very responsive.

442
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:11,991
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a good guy.

443
00:34:12,892 --> 00:34:15,314
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think we could handle this without it going to committee.

444
00:34:15,354 --> 00:34:18,718
[SPEAKER_02]: So just motion to receive and place on file.

445
00:34:18,738 --> 00:34:19,459
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

446
00:34:19,859 --> 00:34:26,086
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion to receive and place on file as amended by Councilor Lazzaro, seconded by Councilor Leming.

[SPEAKER_06]: I move that the negative motion passes.

463
00:34:55,998 --> 00:34:57,760
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we want to take back up Nazar Market?

464
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:58,461
[SPEAKER_09]: We can, yep.

465

00:35:06,627 --> 00:35:07,428
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

00:35:28,671 --> 00:35:30,071
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

473
00:35:30,471 --> 00:35:30,692
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

474

[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

475
00:35:31,852 --> 00:35:32,072
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

476
00:35:32,692 --> 00:35:32,933
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

477
00:35:33,193 --> 00:35:33,433
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

478
00:35:33,533 --> 00:35:38,935
[SPEAKER_06]: So the permanent motion passes 24464 petition for a common victor's license and is our market.

479
00:35:38,955 --> 00:35:41,756
[SPEAKER_06]: Now we'll go to Councilor Scarpelli licensing permitting signs.

480
00:35:41,796 --> 00:35:42,057
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

481
00:35:42,077 --> 00:35:45,218
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Councilor Scarpelli for meeting with our petitioner and getting the information.

482
00:35:46,017 --> 00:35:47,357
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, President Pierce.

483
00:35:47,838 --> 00:35:55,839
[SPEAKER_09]: We talked with our partners from the market and answered all the questions we needed.

484
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:08,402
[SPEAKER_09]: There were some questions that needed to be completed today during one of the process that was brought forward with the health department.

485
00:36:08,942 --> 00:36:11,023
[SPEAKER_09]: All the documents and everything was signed off today.

486
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:11,983
[SPEAKER_09]: So everything is in order.

487
00:36:12,443 --> 00:36:15,364
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'll move forward for approval, Mr. President.

488
00:36:17,383 --> 00:36:18,924
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you know, sooner than later, right?

489
00:36:21,447 --> 00:36:24,349
[SPEAKER_06]: Can we just have your name and your address for our records, please?

490
00:36:24,869 --> 00:36:29,694
[SPEAKER_17]: Yusuf Avcii, 72 Dawson Avenue, West 7, corner ticket 06516.

491
00:36:30,334 --> 00:36:30,574
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

492
00:36:32,916 --> 00:36:33,257
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

493
00:36:33,937 --> 00:36:34,218
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

494
00:36:34,278 --> 00:36:40,263
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli to approve the convictioner's license seconded by Councilor Callahan, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

495
00:36:46,664 --> 00:36:46,764
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

496
00:36:46,784 --> 00:36:46,884
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

497
00:36:46,904 --> 00:36:47,024
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

498
00:36:47,044 --> 00:36:47,104
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

499
00:36:47,124 --> 00:36:47,184
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

500
00:36:47,204 --> 00:36:47,264
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

501
00:36:47,384 --> 00:36:47,544
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

502
00:36:47,965 --> 00:36:48,065
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

503
00:36:48,085 --> 00:36:48,145
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

504
00:36:48,165 --> 00:36:48,765
[SPEAKER_10]: The motion passes.

505
00:36:49,606 --> 00:36:51,567
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for coming and good luck.

506
00:36:51,587 --> 00:36:52,687
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

507
00:36:52,707 --> 00:36:52,907
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks.

508
00:37:08,459 --> 00:37:19,026
[SPEAKER_06]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council hold a question and answer session with Medford senior citizens to discuss the definitions and terminology regarding the proposed Proposition 2 1⁄2 overrides and the proposed debt exclusion measure.

509
00:37:19,126 --> 00:37:20,407
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scarpello.

510
00:37:20,447 --> 00:37:21,348
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

511
00:37:21,468 --> 00:37:24,390
[SPEAKER_09]: Now again, everybody has a platform.

512
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:30,795
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure that everybody knows that I am for voting no on the override.

513
00:37:32,935 --> 00:37:34,856
[SPEAKER_09]: My fellow Councilors are supporting it.

514
00:37:34,936 --> 00:37:36,697
[SPEAKER_09]: So, uh, that's not a secret.

515
00:37:36,897 --> 00:37:46,543
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the, the biggest fear as we're going through, uh, respecting to disagree, to disagree for both of our, our, uh, our viewpoints,

516
00:37:47,102 --> 00:37:54,229
[SPEAKER_09]: I think what's important is that we have to hear what senior citizens are bringing forth.

517
00:37:54,369 --> 00:38:02,918
[SPEAKER_09]: I've heard everything from, I think I've talked to maybe 30 senior citizens in the last probably six days, because now the word's starting to get out.

518
00:38:03,538 --> 00:38:06,882
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's so many views that are so confusing.

519
00:38:07,362 --> 00:38:08,543
[SPEAKER_09]: One person said to me that,

520
00:38:10,245 --> 00:38:17,971
[SPEAKER_09]: her and her friends that were together at the table said, Councilor Scarpelli, why would you oppose a $7.5 million new high school?

521
00:38:19,413 --> 00:38:20,033
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a great fee.

522
00:38:20,053 --> 00:38:21,154
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a great price, right?

523
00:38:22,941 --> 00:38:36,126
[SPEAKER_09]: and the understanding that truly, the residents of the city don't know what is even on these ballots, these ballot questions, because we haven't informed anybody.

524
00:38:36,586 --> 00:38:48,951
[SPEAKER_09]: The process stated on both the state site and if you visit other sites that have either passed or failed their overrides, you've seen a robust response

525
00:38:50,865 --> 00:38:57,869
[SPEAKER_09]: process where there were informative sessions within their community so people were educated.

526
00:38:58,430 --> 00:39:03,853
[SPEAKER_09]: So when they made that choice, they understood the impact in their lives, in their neighbors' lives.

527
00:39:04,553 --> 00:39:07,575
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that we've done a major disservice.

528
00:39:08,155 --> 00:39:13,979
[SPEAKER_09]: We're actually two weeks away from the start of early voting.

529
00:39:14,759 --> 00:39:18,402
[SPEAKER_09]: And the questions from the most vulnerable people in our community,

530
00:39:19,238 --> 00:39:32,564
[SPEAKER_09]: And I can publicly have said it a thousand times, this group, the financial task force that was put together, came back, we haven't seen minutes, there was no public participation, there was no information session.

531
00:39:33,025 --> 00:39:45,951
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's now regulated to people going to the elections office and they're giving them a form that just reads what the override questions are, six, seven, and eight, and that's it.

532
00:39:47,256 --> 00:39:58,445
[SPEAKER_09]: So, and again, I reached out to the director at the Council of Aging, and I asked if there's a possibility.

533
00:39:58,465 --> 00:39:59,786
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, it doesn't have to be my view.

534
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:07,433
[SPEAKER_09]: It could be Councilor Bears in the yes team and Councilor Scarpelli in the no team, but can we have an information center

535
00:40:08,013 --> 00:40:33,391
[SPEAKER_09]: at the senior center so we can inform our seniors and we have the director that can reach out to all of our senior citizens in the city whether they own a rent because when you hear the stories of some of these seniors saying geez yeah we i did the calculator but it wasn't right because my house is appraised at 880 000 shame on you i can't believe that you did that but

536
00:40:34,909 --> 00:40:37,690
[SPEAKER_09]: But when I did the calculations, it said 600,000.

537
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:43,191
[SPEAKER_09]: And so they had questions with the city assessor.

538
00:40:43,211 --> 00:40:46,812
[SPEAKER_09]: And so they came to me about questions about the assessor, about their homes being assessed.

539
00:40:47,292 --> 00:40:48,353
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're not wrong.

540
00:40:48,433 --> 00:40:54,654
[SPEAKER_09]: The city assessor doesn't have the true numbers because he's not prepared for this and he wasn't involved in this process.

541
00:40:54,694 --> 00:41:01,076
[SPEAKER_09]: So when you talk about the ramifications in taxes, we have,

542
00:41:02,256 --> 00:41:06,819
[SPEAKER_09]: It goes both ways, because we had someone say, George, is it true I'm going to pay $5,000 more in taxes?

543
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:10,942
[SPEAKER_09]: And I said, unless you want a $10 million home in Medford, I don't see that happening.

544
00:41:11,002 --> 00:41:12,983
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's the fear that's true.

545
00:41:13,143 --> 00:41:14,004
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really happening.

546
00:41:15,205 --> 00:41:17,907
[SPEAKER_09]: And we do have people that, whether we want to believe it or not,

547
00:41:19,138 --> 00:41:31,623
[SPEAKER_09]: They have to make decisions whether $400 a year could impact what medications they're gonna purchase, or if they can travel to see a child, or if they can figure out if they can go out to dinner.

548
00:41:31,663 --> 00:41:32,723
[SPEAKER_09]: That's how scared they are.

549
00:41:34,224 --> 00:41:36,344
[SPEAKER_09]: And the question was, how do they get there?

550
00:41:36,364 --> 00:41:37,845
[SPEAKER_09]: And I said, I don't know, because we don't know.

551
00:41:39,724 --> 00:41:44,088
[SPEAKER_09]: Because like I said in the past, I've tried to put through a debt exclusion.

552
00:41:44,589 --> 00:41:53,637
[SPEAKER_09]: But what I did when I worked with the financial team and the city assessor at the time, they showed us the breakdown with eliminating our most vulnerable residents.

553
00:41:53,877 --> 00:42:00,684
[SPEAKER_09]: That's our seniors, our residents with special needs and our military.

554
00:42:01,877 --> 00:42:03,680
[SPEAKER_09]: And they broke it down for us so you could see it.

555
00:42:04,521 --> 00:42:06,123
[SPEAKER_09]: And that was a question I had with the city assessor.

556
00:42:06,143 --> 00:42:08,106
[SPEAKER_09]: I said, when will you have that?

557
00:42:08,887 --> 00:42:12,152
[SPEAKER_09]: And he said, unfortunately, you probably won't see that till the end of October, the true breakdown.

558
00:42:13,173 --> 00:42:16,498
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, he, to, to, to,

559
00:42:17,850 --> 00:42:33,425
[SPEAKER_09]: move forward with that, the fear that people don't understand that in 2025, these senior citizens homes are going to be assessed again, but not at the 2025 rate of housing, but at 2023, which was a very good year.

560
00:42:33,865 --> 00:42:37,769
[SPEAKER_09]: So that means the homes are going to be a price higher than it really should be.

561
00:42:38,490 --> 00:42:40,211
[SPEAKER_09]: So there are so many fear factors in there.

562
00:42:40,592 --> 00:42:42,974
[SPEAKER_09]: And to go back to what I

563
00:42:44,611 --> 00:42:51,817
[SPEAKER_09]: I talked to the director of the Council of Aging, and she said, unfortunately, I have to run it by the mayor's office.

564
00:42:52,858 --> 00:43:02,526
[SPEAKER_09]: Anytime, as a city councilor, I wanted to go to the senior center, I would call and say, I'd like to come down and introduce myself and buy ice cream.

565
00:43:02,587 --> 00:43:04,748
[SPEAKER_09]: We've probably all done it, and it was never an issue.

566
00:43:05,549 --> 00:43:10,351
[SPEAKER_09]: When I called the next day and I said, can you please let me know if we can do this?

567
00:43:10,571 --> 00:43:23,715
[SPEAKER_09]: And her words were, unfortunately, the mayor responded and said that we need to get legal representation, whether we can go and sit with our seniors to help them understand what this process is.

568
00:43:24,075 --> 00:43:28,197
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, don't get me wrong, there's probably some that are for it, there'll be for it, there's some against it.

569
00:43:28,237 --> 00:43:28,837
[SPEAKER_09]: The problem is,

570
00:43:31,570 --> 00:43:41,558
[SPEAKER_09]: If I hear the word transparency come out of this office and this team, I might vomit because this is totally the opposite of what transparency is.

571
00:43:41,979 --> 00:43:43,140
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the total opposite.

572
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,221
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like bizarro world.

573
00:43:45,381 --> 00:43:46,182
[SPEAKER_09]: What's transparent?

574
00:43:46,242 --> 00:43:48,364
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever the opposite is, this is what we've done.

575
00:43:50,025 --> 00:43:51,907
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, social media loves it.

576
00:43:54,534 --> 00:43:59,058
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scarpelli never, ever once has said, I don't want an override.

577
00:43:59,718 --> 00:44:04,562
[SPEAKER_09]: What I'm saying is, first, let's see if we need the override.

578
00:44:04,822 --> 00:44:10,487
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's publicly work together to figure it out and stakeholders throughout the whole community figure it out.

579
00:44:12,568 --> 00:44:20,954
[SPEAKER_09]: Figure it out, because if you go on these different websites and you look at what override means, so let's say the MTA, they have a great blueprint.

580
00:44:21,815 --> 00:44:27,579
[SPEAKER_09]: And they said, before you go out to do an override, you make sure you get the buy-in from stakeholders.

581
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:34,965
[SPEAKER_09]: And those stakeholders would be your superintendent, your senior citizens, your business community, your students.

582
00:44:36,026 --> 00:44:37,027
[SPEAKER_09]: We did nothing of that.

583
00:44:37,927 --> 00:44:39,609
[SPEAKER_09]: So what I'm begging this council to do

584
00:44:41,423 --> 00:44:58,456
[SPEAKER_09]: join me in asking the mayor to hold a session, hopefully next week together in this chamber as a form of a motion that we hold an information session that seniors can come into this chamber and we can explain what the override is, how we got here.

585
00:44:58,856 --> 00:45:09,204
[SPEAKER_09]: Like again, I'm gonna say it again, in every community that I've researched, and I've done a lot of research on this now, the three most important pieces when you talk about overrides, how did we get there?

586
00:45:10,353 --> 00:45:11,414
[SPEAKER_09]: How are we going to correct it?

587
00:45:12,235 --> 00:45:14,737
[SPEAKER_09]: And what are we going to do so we never have to go there again?

588
00:45:16,038 --> 00:45:17,379
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't know how we got here.

589
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:22,863
[SPEAKER_09]: Although we want to say that, you know, the administration for years past, I don't disagree.

590
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:24,545
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't disagree.

591
00:45:24,605 --> 00:45:30,549
[SPEAKER_09]: We've done a terrible job in former leaderships to really keep things up to par.

592
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:32,811
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not disagreeable at all.

593
00:45:34,052 --> 00:45:37,055
[SPEAKER_09]: But where we are today, think about this now.

594
00:45:37,095 --> 00:45:38,476
[SPEAKER_09]: And I tried to explain this to seniors.

595
00:45:38,496 --> 00:45:39,336
[SPEAKER_09]: This is what's scary to them.

596
00:45:40,327 --> 00:45:51,579
[SPEAKER_09]: If on November 5th it's voted in, the process that the mayor has called for, that their taxes will be, you'll see those taxes starting in January of 2025, right away.

597
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:59,227
[SPEAKER_09]: No time to plan, no time to understand, even that, and I'd love to hear it, it's only $37 a month, it's only $40 a month.

598
00:45:59,247 --> 00:45:59,567
[SPEAKER_09]: That's farce.

599
00:46:02,947 --> 00:46:06,229
[SPEAKER_09]: Because as homes are being assessed, they're getting taxes higher.

600
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:09,752
[SPEAKER_09]: As homes are being assessed, CPA taxes are rising.

601
00:46:10,292 --> 00:46:13,415
[SPEAKER_09]: As homes are being assessed, you're adding these $40 a month.

602
00:46:14,295 --> 00:46:18,158
[SPEAKER_09]: That, in their new tax bill, it's not $40 a month.

603
00:46:18,558 --> 00:46:23,262
[SPEAKER_09]: To some people, they're looking at four, five, $600 a month.

604
00:46:24,483 --> 00:46:25,704
[SPEAKER_09]: I know because I've seen it.

605
00:46:27,742 --> 00:46:32,247
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's disingenuous to sit back as a council to say, we're all about affordable housing.

606
00:46:32,488 --> 00:46:36,673
[SPEAKER_09]: We're all about making sure that we want to keep residents in their homes and we're going to fight for them.

607
00:46:36,933 --> 00:46:41,799
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember all those buildings that developers are coming in and we had all those people that are wearing buttons and we're all rah-rah-ing?

608
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:44,922
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we have thousands of those people.

609
00:46:45,967 --> 00:46:57,694
[SPEAKER_09]: that we represent every day that are telling us, stop, because the only outcome for them is going to be selling their home and finding an alternative place to live.

610
00:46:58,734 --> 00:47:00,996
[SPEAKER_09]: So again, in a form of emotion, Mr. President,

611
00:47:02,014 --> 00:47:17,589
[SPEAKER_09]: I make the motion that the city council, as a team, ask for an open meeting for all of our senior citizens to have an opportunity before the start of early voting, because as they said, the voting starts, I believe, Tuesday the 16th.

612
00:47:18,029 --> 00:47:22,453
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's important that they come and they hear, they get the answers that we need.

613
00:47:22,834 --> 00:47:24,856
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, again, it might be yes.

614
00:47:25,925 --> 00:47:27,146
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'll have to respect that.

615
00:47:27,686 --> 00:47:40,517
[SPEAKER_09]: And it might be no, and you'll have to respect that, but at least give the seniors an opportunity to understand the impact, to understand the process, because that's the other piece that really bothers a lot of people.

616
00:47:43,976 --> 00:47:47,178
[SPEAKER_09]: I can keep going, but I don't want to make it more of a platform than it sounds.

617
00:47:47,519 --> 00:47:57,426
[SPEAKER_09]: But I beg my colleagues to vote yes to ask the mayor to open the city council chambers maybe next Wednesday night for the senior citizens to come in and inform them of what's happening.

618
00:47:57,506 --> 00:47:58,107
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much.

619
00:47:58,227 --> 00:47:59,227
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

620
00:47:59,368 --> 00:48:00,368
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a couple of things.

621
00:48:01,189 --> 00:48:05,372
[SPEAKER_06]: I am happy to schedule, without the permission of the mayor, a meeting October 15th.

622
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:11,422
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a little bit so next week is the week after because that's we have available but before next regular meeting.

623
00:48:12,283 --> 00:48:13,083
[SPEAKER_06]: October 15th.

624
00:48:13,644 --> 00:48:23,671
[SPEAKER_06]: We go as long as we need to go we'll do it as a committee of the whole it will be televised publicized and we can have the topic the questions and answers from the public regarding the proposition 2 and a half.

625
00:48:24,022 --> 00:48:24,362
[SPEAKER_09]: That's great.

626
00:48:24,382 --> 00:48:35,210
[SPEAKER_09]: And if we can, uh, council bears, if you can ask the mayor to, to allow the director of a council of aging to reach out, to give the opportunity to reach out to all the senior citizens.

627
00:48:35,570 --> 00:48:44,576
[SPEAKER_09]: So they're informed, um, because a lot of people don't have this platform and don't follow social media and without a newspaper, it's very difficult that they don't know what's going on.

628
00:48:44,616 --> 00:48:45,717
[SPEAKER_09]: So if we could do that, I appreciate it.

629
00:48:45,737 --> 00:48:48,839
[SPEAKER_06]: If we could incorporate that as an amendment to the paper, um,

630
00:48:49,437 --> 00:48:54,118
[SPEAKER_06]: There are a lot of laws around what cities can and can't do in terms of advocacy.

631
00:48:54,178 --> 00:49:00,660
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know that I think the city is trying to protect all of its employees from being accused of violating those laws.

632
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:08,202
[SPEAKER_06]: There is also on the city website, medfordma.org, something more than just the text of the override questions.

633
00:49:08,242 --> 00:49:13,963
[SPEAKER_06]: There's an explainer from the city that has been reviewed by council so as to not sway into the

634
00:49:14,523 --> 00:49:21,726
[SPEAKER_06]: legal questions around this, but if folks look at that, there's a button right on the front page of the city website that includes a municipal explanation.

635
00:49:21,746 --> 00:49:27,908
[SPEAKER_06]: I got you, Anna, and I have you, has an explanation of the overrides from municipal perspective.

636
00:49:28,368 --> 00:49:32,690
[SPEAKER_06]: I do just want to clarify a couple of things regarding the city assessor.

637
00:49:34,050 --> 00:49:41,973
[SPEAKER_06]: The data that is being used regarding calculators, both from the DLS and online is the fiscal 24, the current year tax data,

638
00:49:42,513 --> 00:49:43,834
[SPEAKER_06]: current year tax assessments.

639
00:49:44,474 --> 00:49:51,658
[SPEAKER_06]: I personally have been in multiple meetings with the assessor for over a year regarding the process of this, so take that for what you will.

640
00:49:51,778 --> 00:49:53,759
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been in those rooms, I've had those conversations.

641
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:57,241
[SPEAKER_06]: And in terms of assessments,

642
00:49:58,121 --> 00:50:03,265
[SPEAKER_06]: The tax year is always based, the assessments for the tax year are always based on the prior year.

643
00:50:03,965 --> 00:50:08,248
[SPEAKER_06]: So when we're talking about 2025, they only have complete sales data from 2023.

644
00:50:08,788 --> 00:50:10,389
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what's used to adjust the assessment.

645
00:50:10,429 --> 00:50:11,650
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the same every year.

646
00:50:11,710 --> 00:50:12,871
[SPEAKER_06]: That's always the process.

647
00:50:13,471 --> 00:50:14,412
[SPEAKER_06]: And it always is.

648
00:50:15,172 --> 00:50:20,236
[SPEAKER_06]: As we all know, the tax rate setting process happens in December after those valuations are calculated.

649
00:50:21,156 --> 00:50:22,958
[SPEAKER_06]: I have been in communication with the assessor.

650
00:50:23,559 --> 00:50:29,205
[SPEAKER_06]: All of the data is data from the assessor's database or from the Division of Local Services of the State Department of Revenue.

651
00:50:29,686 --> 00:50:31,068
[SPEAKER_06]: So that is what is out there.

652
00:50:31,088 --> 00:50:39,397
[SPEAKER_06]: The tax rate process will essentially follow its normal course where we will have meetings in November and December regarding the tax rate.

653
00:50:39,797 --> 00:50:43,600
[SPEAKER_06]: and we will either be setting the tax rate based on a yes vote or a no vote.

654
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:44,761
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's how that will happen.

655
00:50:44,821 --> 00:50:54,588
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just wanted to say that I have met with the assessor multiple times in groups and one-on-one about this process, and he is informed and was informed and was a part of that.

656
00:50:54,748 --> 00:50:55,709
[SPEAKER_09]: If I can, then that's great.

657
00:50:55,729 --> 00:51:07,837
[SPEAKER_09]: So what I'll do is I think the Freedom of Information Act that was presented for information that was gathered through that task force and the emails from the assessor, we could bring it that night so everybody can see it.

658
00:51:07,938 --> 00:51:08,398
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you.

659
00:51:08,718 --> 00:51:08,918
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

660
00:51:08,938 --> 00:51:09,078
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

661
00:51:09,118 --> 00:51:17,200
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I, I met with him in person, so there wouldn't be anything on paper, but yeah, meetings, meetings tend to happen by talking to people.

662
00:51:18,801 --> 00:51:26,643
[SPEAKER_06]: So I will go first to vice president Collins, and then we'll go to councilor Zara and councilor Callahan, vice president Collins.

663
00:51:27,472 --> 00:51:28,413
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, President Bears.

664
00:51:28,733 --> 00:51:31,476
[SPEAKER_21]: I'd like to thank the Councilor for putting this forward.

665
00:51:31,556 --> 00:51:33,257
[SPEAKER_21]: I'd be happy to second the motion.

666
00:51:33,838 --> 00:51:38,802
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that when it comes to being an informed voter, you know, that's just the most important thing.

667
00:51:40,524 --> 00:51:50,593
[SPEAKER_21]: And of course, as has been discussed, we have to be, you know, when we're talking about all these forums, we have to make, we have to remember that we have to treat this the same way that we would

668
00:51:51,411 --> 00:52:00,244
[SPEAKER_21]: If a candidate was running their own campaign, we have to be really careful about not using city resources to be for one side or the other.

669
00:52:01,146 --> 00:52:05,893
[SPEAKER_21]: That's why I do my campaigning on this issue outside of City Hall, even though everybody knows my position on it.

670
00:52:07,932 --> 00:52:18,918
[SPEAKER_21]: But I think that it is extremely valuable to use our platform to hold a Q&A session, because when it comes to this issue, there are no bad questions.

671
00:52:18,978 --> 00:52:21,779
[SPEAKER_21]: I've had some great conversations with people over the past few months.

672
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:24,540
[SPEAKER_21]: I remember one person said to me, let me get this straight.

673
00:52:24,701 --> 00:52:27,822
[SPEAKER_21]: If this were to pass, my property taxes would go up by 2.5%.

674
00:52:28,202 --> 00:52:32,925
[SPEAKER_21]: And I was like, I'm so glad you asked, because that's not the case.

675
00:52:33,485 --> 00:52:34,786
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think it's really important that

676
00:52:35,768 --> 00:52:50,548
[SPEAKER_21]: We work within the parameters that we have to have those conversations to make a space for those conversations, whether it's with our senior citizens to talk about this process, the potential impacts to talk about the many exemption programs that were maxed out on.

677
00:52:51,028 --> 00:53:04,519
[SPEAKER_21]: and to invite all other parts of our constituencies, people who are hungry for that information so that everybody can go into the polling booths, feeling as informed as they want to be and really confident to cast their vote one way or the other.

678
00:53:04,539 --> 00:53:05,660
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'll second the motion.

679
00:53:05,860 --> 00:53:06,340
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you very much.

680
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:08,222
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

681
00:53:08,422 --> 00:53:10,223
[SPEAKER_06]: I will go to Councilor Lazzaro, Councilor Callahan.

682
00:53:12,847 --> 00:53:13,787
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm also in favor of this.

683
00:53:13,827 --> 00:53:15,007
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a great idea.

684
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:28,170
[SPEAKER_02]: I have been to the Senior Center for a Listening Session with Councilor Leming before, and we had a great experience there, though it was a small turnout, but small and mighty.

685
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:34,692
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a great conversation, but my hesitation with the wording of the

686
00:53:37,067 --> 00:53:44,432
[SPEAKER_02]: resolution is that if we are to if we're going to do a committee of the whole, I think it would probably just be open to the public, right?

687
00:53:44,452 --> 00:53:54,677
[SPEAKER_02]: So anybody who has any questions, it could be any group of people that is curious or has, you know, a particular interest in these issues.

688
00:53:55,078 --> 00:54:05,143
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, and as such, I would encourage anybody who isn't sure about what these questions mean, to attend or come on zoom.

689
00:54:06,693 --> 00:54:10,756
[SPEAKER_02]: listen and ask the questions that they would like answers to.

690
00:54:11,156 --> 00:54:23,905
[SPEAKER_02]: I would also be curious about if the school committee members who would be able to speak to the specifics of some of the school related questions might be able to participate or if they would do maybe hold their own.

691
00:54:24,245 --> 00:54:26,947
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure how that would, we wouldn't be able to do it at the same time.

692
00:54:26,967 --> 00:54:31,971
[SPEAKER_06]: I would suggest that you reach out to them and have them go through their own process.

693
00:54:31,991 --> 00:54:32,992
[SPEAKER_06]: They would have to do their own process.

694
00:54:33,692 --> 00:54:33,912
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

695
00:54:35,774 --> 00:54:36,274
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Callahan.

696
00:54:37,485 --> 00:54:38,145
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you so much.

697
00:54:38,605 --> 00:54:39,606
[SPEAKER_13]: Glad this is on the agenda.

698
00:54:39,706 --> 00:54:44,627
[SPEAKER_13]: I think hearing from constituents and also informing constituents is crucially important.

699
00:54:47,068 --> 00:54:52,929
[SPEAKER_13]: Among the many vulnerable populations we have here I think our children are definitely on that list.

700
00:54:53,870 --> 00:54:55,110
[SPEAKER_13]: I would hope that parents

701
00:54:56,382 --> 00:54:58,004
[SPEAKER_13]: would be explicitly reached out to.

702
00:54:58,024 --> 00:55:06,731
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if we can go through the PTOs of the various schools, but I think that those people also will be highly, highly impacted by the override vote.

703
00:55:07,771 --> 00:55:17,599
[SPEAKER_13]: And I would hope that we can not only reach out to seniors who are a vulnerable population, but also reach out to parents and make sure that they are also included.

704
00:55:17,619 --> 00:55:21,262
[SPEAKER_11]: I will go to Councilor Leming.

705
00:55:22,557 --> 00:55:28,703
[SPEAKER_11]: I was actually going to make a motion to invite the members of the school committee to come.

706
00:55:29,164 --> 00:55:33,488
[SPEAKER_06]: I would contact them yourself and see if they can set something up through their own process.

707
00:55:34,109 --> 00:55:34,349
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

708
00:55:35,850 --> 00:55:36,331
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Tseng.

709
00:55:38,273 --> 00:55:40,395
[SPEAKER_06]: I just don't want to add another meeting for them without asking.

710
00:55:43,645 --> 00:55:49,106
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Callahan didn't steal it.

711
00:55:49,326 --> 00:55:50,607
[SPEAKER_07]: Talked about one of the ideas I had.

712
00:55:51,327 --> 00:55:56,628
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the other requests I'd have to amend this paper, I am in support of it.

713
00:55:56,748 --> 00:56:04,410
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's great to get as much information out there as possible to have people answer as many questions as possible as well.

714
00:56:05,050 --> 00:56:09,051
[SPEAKER_07]: One, a few groups of people that are particularly vulnerable and

715
00:56:09,711 --> 00:56:14,455
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, are we'll also find this process new will be would be immigrant voters as well.

716
00:56:15,436 --> 00:56:33,791
[SPEAKER_07]: And so if we can ask the commute this administration to ask the communities on to translate the override the budget override information on the city website to the best of their abilities and help distribute that information.

717
00:56:34,052 --> 00:56:34,552
[SPEAKER_07]: That'd be great.

718
00:56:35,133 --> 00:56:35,453
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

719
00:56:35,473 --> 00:56:35,533
[SPEAKER_07]: And

720
00:56:38,014 --> 00:56:44,420
[SPEAKER_07]: We could invite them to the meeting, although they might want separate meetings with different languages, so that might be more of a community-zone thing.

721
00:56:47,804 --> 00:56:49,626
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, any further comments from members of the council?

722
00:56:51,209 --> 00:57:20,129
[SPEAKER_06]: So what I have here is amending the paper to include residents and parents, to request that the council on aging be able to do outreach to senior citizens, to invite them to the meeting, to request community liaisons be able to translate the information that the city has made available, the questions and the information, the city municipal information sheet reviewed by legal, and that this is all to refer to committee of the whole, and I will schedule that for October 15th.

723
00:57:22,182 --> 00:57:22,922
[SPEAKER_06]: Does that sound right?

724
00:57:23,343 --> 00:57:24,083
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything I missed?

725
00:57:25,744 --> 00:57:27,065
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Callahan.

726
00:57:27,485 --> 00:57:31,368
[SPEAKER_13]: Reaching out through, say, if we're going through the senior center, then also being able to go through the PTOs.

727
00:57:31,668 --> 00:57:35,951
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, council and aging, community liaisons, and PTOs, got it.

728
00:57:37,352 --> 00:57:37,632
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

729
00:57:40,133 --> 00:57:46,778
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, and that was by Councilor Scarpelli, as amended by everyone, and seconded by Vice President Collins.

730
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:51,802
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll go to public participation, please raise your hand on Zoom or come to the podium in person.

731
00:57:52,603 --> 00:57:56,206
[SPEAKER_06]: Please form a line behind Gaston, and we'll start with Gaston.

732
00:57:56,666 --> 00:58:01,971
[SPEAKER_06]: Gaston, you'll have three minutes, or we'll go to Paulette, right?

733
00:58:02,471 --> 00:58:03,292
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, we'll go to Paulette.

734
00:58:04,032 --> 00:58:07,035
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll have three minutes, then we'll go to Zoom, then we'll come back to the room.

735
00:58:07,916 --> 00:58:11,358
[SPEAKER_19]: Hi, my name is Paulette Vartabedian, 27 Central Ave.

736
00:58:11,399 --> 00:58:13,040
[SPEAKER_19]: in Medford, and I wore my

737
00:58:13,544 --> 00:58:16,945
[SPEAKER_19]: vintage 54 shirt today to prove that I am a senior.

738
00:58:18,105 --> 00:58:22,346
[SPEAKER_19]: And that this proposition two and a half is very important to me.

739
00:58:23,106 --> 00:58:31,548
[SPEAKER_19]: And I am very, very happy to see all the Councilors agreeing on this, rather than, you know, butting heads all the time.

740
00:58:32,049 --> 00:58:37,450
[SPEAKER_19]: But is this Wednesday meeting going to be on Zoom or only in person?

741
00:58:38,052 --> 00:58:40,894
[SPEAKER_06]: This will be a Tuesday meeting, 6 p.m.

742
00:58:41,094 --> 00:58:43,235
[SPEAKER_06]: in this room and on Zoom and on YouTube.

743
00:58:43,356 --> 00:58:44,576
[SPEAKER_19]: On Tuesday or Wednesday?

744
00:58:44,596 --> 00:58:45,577
[SPEAKER_19]: I thought you said Wednesday.

745
00:58:46,217 --> 00:58:47,338
[SPEAKER_06]: Tuesday, October 15th.

746
00:58:47,358 --> 00:58:47,919
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

747
00:58:48,379 --> 00:58:49,440
[SPEAKER_19]: It will be on Zoom as well.

748
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:49,740
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

749
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:50,340
[SPEAKER_19]: Excellent.

750
00:58:51,001 --> 00:58:56,524
[SPEAKER_19]: Also, I just want to point out that despite my many degrees, I don't have a computer.

751
00:58:56,885 --> 00:59:02,048
[SPEAKER_19]: So there are many seniors that aren't able to access these things via computer or Zoom.

752
00:59:02,368 --> 00:59:06,131
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's unfortunate that it took this long to get this

753
00:59:07,039 --> 00:59:12,942
[SPEAKER_19]: forum started, you know, to the 15th and it wasn't before when this issue came up.

754
00:59:13,402 --> 00:59:19,584
[SPEAKER_19]: But that being said, I'm really happy that it is coming up because I think I know what I'm going to vote.

755
00:59:19,945 --> 00:59:21,825
[SPEAKER_19]: But it is I have questions as well.

756
00:59:21,845 --> 00:59:25,167
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's very, I'm very happy to see this coming forth.

757
00:59:25,587 --> 00:59:27,288
[SPEAKER_19]: So thank you all and I'll

758
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:29,421
[SPEAKER_19]: We have my shirt again next week.

759
00:59:30,241 --> 00:59:30,762
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

760
00:59:30,782 --> 00:59:32,383
[SPEAKER_06]: Go to zoom.

761
00:59:32,403 --> 00:59:35,485
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll go to Jennifer on zoom, name and address for the record, please.

762
00:59:35,945 --> 00:59:37,066
[SPEAKER_06]: You have three minutes.

763
00:59:38,607 --> 00:59:38,847
[SPEAKER_16]: Hello.

764
00:59:38,967 --> 00:59:40,248
[SPEAKER_16]: My name is Jennifer Yakko.

765
00:59:40,408 --> 00:59:44,851
[SPEAKER_16]: I live at 16 monument street, and I am also a senior.

766
00:59:45,666 --> 00:59:49,148
[SPEAKER_16]: And I wanted to thank Councilor Scarpelli for his interest in seniors.

767
00:59:50,008 --> 01:00:01,333
[SPEAKER_16]: And at the same time, I agree with what some of the other councilors have raised, and I'm really glad you raised it, that it's not just seniors who are interested in knowing about the issues that we'll be voting on.

768
01:00:01,413 --> 01:00:04,195
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm glad to hear that there'll be outreach to other communities.

769
01:00:04,295 --> 01:00:09,817
[SPEAKER_16]: I've been asked about these overrides by people who are not seniors.

770
01:00:10,057 --> 01:00:13,099
[SPEAKER_16]: So I know that seniors are not the only ones who

771
01:00:13,832 --> 01:00:14,532
[SPEAKER_16]: are interested.

772
01:00:14,972 --> 01:00:23,514
[SPEAKER_16]: And I hope that a very visible notice of the meeting will be put on the city website so that people can be apprised of it.

773
01:00:24,434 --> 01:00:24,774
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

774
01:00:26,634 --> 01:00:27,034
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

775
01:00:27,054 --> 01:00:37,676
[SPEAKER_06]: And I will note there are also a number of quite a few private events that have happened or will be happening as well to talk to members of the public.

776
01:00:37,776 --> 01:00:42,637
[SPEAKER_06]: So I won't get into that any more than I am here, but I do suggest people be on the lookout for those.

777
01:00:43,319 --> 01:00:45,161
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll go to the podium.

778
01:00:45,181 --> 01:00:46,183
[SPEAKER_06]: Name and address for the record, please.

779
01:00:46,203 --> 01:00:46,884
[SPEAKER_06]: You have three minutes.

780
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:58,191
[SPEAKER_20]: Gaston Fiore, 61 Stickney Road. Senior citizens are one of the most vulnerable groups in our community, and also one of our most valuable.

781
01:00:58,871 --> 01:01:05,176
[SPEAKER_20]: Some of our seniors might rent, possibly dedicating a large proportion of their income, likely fixed, to their rent.

782
01:01:06,017 --> 01:01:14,904
[SPEAKER_20]: Other seniors might be homeowners, possibly having bought their houses decades ago, likely being wealthy in terms of their house, but much poorer in terms of their income.

783
01:01:15,545 --> 01:01:20,289
[SPEAKER_20]: Government officials should not pursue policies that could place our seniors under financial distress.

784
01:01:21,499 --> 01:01:26,900
[SPEAKER_20]: Raising property taxes will negatively impact our senior citizens, particularly those on fixed incomes.

785
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:34,882
[SPEAKER_20]: Seniors often living on savings and social security are less able to absorb sudden increases in expenses.

786
01:01:35,422 --> 01:01:37,063
[SPEAKER_20]: Property taxes are regressive.

787
01:01:37,583 --> 01:01:42,504
[SPEAKER_20]: They take a larger percentage of income from those with lower income compared to higher earners.

788
01:01:43,264 --> 01:01:49,986
[SPEAKER_20]: Increasing property taxes could force many seniors to make tough choices between essentials, such as medication and food,

789
01:01:50,905 --> 01:01:51,985
[SPEAKER_20]: or maintaining their homes.

790
01:01:52,906 --> 01:01:56,347
[SPEAKER_20]: Higher property taxes could lead to the displacement of our seniors.

791
01:01:57,067 --> 01:01:59,688
[SPEAKER_20]: For those that rent, the rents will go up.

792
01:02:00,629 --> 01:02:04,030
[SPEAKER_20]: Landlords will pass on the increase in real estate taxes to tenants.

793
01:02:04,650 --> 01:02:08,952
[SPEAKER_20]: For those that own their homes, they might not be able to afford the increase in real estate taxes.

794
01:02:09,572 --> 01:02:15,355
[SPEAKER_20]: Having to move at an old age might lead to undesirable levels of both mental and physical strain.

795
01:02:16,334 --> 01:02:22,719
[SPEAKER_20]: If there is one group in our community that we should try to prevent from being displaced, it is our senior citizens.

796
01:02:23,460 --> 01:02:32,227
[SPEAKER_20]: Moreover, higher property taxes will also reduce the disposable income available to seniors, limiting their ability to spend on local goods and services.

797
01:02:32,888 --> 01:02:39,012
[SPEAKER_20]: This decrease in purchasing power not only affects seniors, but also local businesses that rely on their patronage.

798
01:02:39,912 --> 01:02:43,535
[SPEAKER_20]: Lower spending could lead to contraction of the local economy.

799
01:02:44,276 --> 01:02:50,841
[SPEAKER_20]: Higher taxes stifle economic growth, which is exactly the opposite of what the government should be striving for.

800
01:02:52,182 --> 01:03:01,606
[SPEAKER_20]: In essence, higher property taxes would place a substantial financial strain on senior citizens, undermining their economic stability and wellbeing.

801
01:03:02,226 --> 01:03:13,631
[SPEAKER_20]: It's crucial for our government officials to consider these adverse effects and explore alternative avenues for raising revenue that do not disproportionately burden our seniors.

802
01:03:13,711 --> 01:03:14,331
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you very much.

803
01:03:14,351 --> 01:03:16,152
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

804
01:03:16,952 --> 01:03:18,853
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll go to no one on Zoom.

805
01:03:18,993 --> 01:03:20,513
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll go to the podium, name and address of the record.

806
01:03:20,533 --> 01:03:21,394
[SPEAKER_06]: You have three minutes.

807
01:03:23,462 --> 01:03:27,605
[SPEAKER_04]: Good evening, Nick Giurleo, G-I-U-R-L-E-O 40 Robinson Road.

808
01:03:28,786 --> 01:03:30,867
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm speaking in favor of this resolution.

809
01:03:30,887 --> 01:03:32,148
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm very happy to see it.

810
01:03:32,669 --> 01:03:39,914
[SPEAKER_04]: Seniors really are important in Medford, so it's good to reach out to them in any way we can on issues that really will impact them.

811
01:03:40,995 --> 01:03:50,041
[SPEAKER_04]: The way I see this resolution, it's just calling for a fairly innocuous community meeting to give our seniors some information on what these ballot questions are really all about.

812
01:03:50,722 --> 01:03:52,163
[SPEAKER_04]: Given my personal opinion that

813
01:03:53,311 --> 01:03:56,054
[SPEAKER_04]: approval of them will have a disastrous impact on seniors.

814
01:03:56,114 --> 01:04:01,399
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's very important to educate them on the issues so they can come to those conclusions themselves.

815
01:04:02,199 --> 01:04:06,684
[SPEAKER_04]: My opinion is based on this just terrible cost of living crisis the country is facing.

816
01:04:07,564 --> 01:04:09,947
[SPEAKER_04]: That crisis is due to fiscal irresponsibility.

817
01:04:10,567 --> 01:04:17,669
[SPEAKER_04]: And it seems like these ballot measures, if approved, are really gonna be promoting that, which has led to this cost-of-living crisis.

818
01:04:18,629 --> 01:04:24,510
[SPEAKER_04]: There really is, I think, some misinformation out there about what these ballot questions really are all about.

819
01:04:25,010 --> 01:04:32,752
[SPEAKER_04]: We hear words being used, like investment, when we're not really saying what this really is, which is just taxation.

820
01:04:33,212 --> 01:04:34,553
[SPEAKER_04]: People really are struggling.

821
01:04:34,933 --> 01:04:39,974
[SPEAKER_04]: It's important to educate them on the issues so they can understand why they're struggling.

822
01:04:40,932 --> 01:04:51,698
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would just highlight what the previous speaker said about the severe economic challenges that seniors throughout the country really are facing that I think we can all agree on.

823
01:04:51,738 --> 01:04:52,958
[SPEAKER_04]: They're on fixed incomes.

824
01:04:53,539 --> 01:05:05,405
[SPEAKER_04]: And data shows that when seniors on fixed incomes face unexpected increased costs, they're forced to forego necessities, necessities like food, necessities like prescription medications.

825
01:05:06,437 --> 01:05:11,200
[SPEAKER_04]: really do have to be aware that recklessly raising taxes will have real consequences.

826
01:05:11,381 --> 01:05:14,823
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's more than just harming the economic diversity of the city.

827
01:05:15,383 --> 01:05:18,586
[SPEAKER_04]: In some cases, this could be life or death for people who are vulnerable.

828
01:05:19,086 --> 01:05:22,348
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would encourage everyone to approve of this resolution.

829
01:05:22,709 --> 01:05:23,469
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for listening.

830
01:05:25,010 --> 01:05:25,471
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

831
01:05:25,491 --> 01:05:29,894
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would just to that point, encourage anyone listening to

832
01:05:30,669 --> 01:05:34,771
[SPEAKER_06]: look at the exemptions available for property taxes, the deferral program, et cetera.

833
01:05:35,351 --> 01:05:42,474
[SPEAKER_06]: This council has made it a very important point to maximize to the utmost what the state will allow us to do for those programs.

834
01:05:42,514 --> 01:05:43,215
[SPEAKER_06]: We have done that.

835
01:05:43,715 --> 01:05:48,577
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have also tied our programs to go up whenever the state increases the amount.

836
01:05:48,657 --> 01:05:50,498
[SPEAKER_06]: So in the past, they didn't go up for a long time.

837
01:05:51,138 --> 01:05:53,880
[SPEAKER_06]: There were huge gaps between us and other communities.

838
01:05:53,940 --> 01:05:58,582
[SPEAKER_06]: We have corrected that and they will go up automatically as the state increases.

839
01:05:59,222 --> 01:06:00,683
[SPEAKER_06]: the conditions for those programs.

840
01:06:02,024 --> 01:06:04,346
[SPEAKER_06]: Go to Zoom.

841
01:06:04,807 --> 01:06:06,168
[SPEAKER_06]: Name and address for the record, please.

842
01:06:06,228 --> 01:06:07,609
[SPEAKER_06]: You have three minutes.

843
01:06:08,249 --> 01:06:09,550
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Castagnetti, I believe.

844
01:06:18,057 --> 01:06:20,258
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Castagnetti, I'm asking you to unmute.

845
01:06:23,361 --> 01:06:24,101
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you hear me, please?

846
01:06:25,082 --> 01:06:25,242
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

847
01:06:25,342 --> 01:06:26,123
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll restart your time.

848
01:06:27,642 --> 01:06:28,762
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

849
01:06:30,483 --> 01:06:33,923
[SPEAKER_03]: Andrew Cassinetti on Cushman Street, East Ford Mass.

850
01:06:34,383 --> 01:06:44,846
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to thank George Scarpelli, the Councilor, for putting this forward and for you to accept it for the next Tuesday's meeting, is it?

851
01:06:47,786 --> 01:06:49,346
[SPEAKER_06]: Tuesday, October 15th.

852
01:06:50,667 --> 01:06:51,927
[SPEAKER_03]: On the 15th, thank you.

853
01:06:52,847 --> 01:06:56,668
[SPEAKER_03]: I am a senior citizen myself and my wife and

854
01:06:57,825 --> 01:06:59,066
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to fix incomes.

855
01:07:01,107 --> 01:07:06,289
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you, in my pre-minute span, can you help the people out?

856
01:07:06,990 --> 01:07:11,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you tell me, question number six, how many million is that for?

857
01:07:13,133 --> 01:07:17,435
[SPEAKER_06]: That is for a $30 million bond for a new fire headquarters.

858
01:07:18,455 --> 01:07:19,736
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no, question six.

859
01:07:21,997 --> 01:07:30,485
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, question six, it's a $2 per year cost to finance the payment of bonds for a new fire headquarters.

860
01:07:33,547 --> 01:07:34,488
[SPEAKER_06]: The bond, the total.

861
01:07:34,548 --> 01:07:35,689
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, that's a debt exclusion.

862
01:07:37,411 --> 01:07:40,754
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, question six, is it a debt exclusion or an override?

863
01:07:41,374 --> 01:07:42,636
[SPEAKER_06]: That is a debt exclusion.

864
01:07:44,277 --> 01:07:46,319
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, and how much is the total amount?

865
01:07:48,204 --> 01:07:57,409
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the way that a debt exclusion works is that you have it for the amount of the bond for the construction of the project, and that is paid over many years.

866
01:07:58,270 --> 01:08:04,614
[SPEAKER_06]: The bond amount is estimated to be about $30 million, and the estimate of the annual impact is about $2 million.

867
01:08:04,754 --> 01:08:07,976
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, question number seven.

868
01:08:08,816 --> 01:08:10,157
[SPEAKER_03]: That's an override, yes?

869
01:08:10,997 --> 01:08:12,138
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, that is an override.

870
01:08:13,018 --> 01:08:15,460
[SPEAKER_03]: And what is the total amount for that override, sir?

871
01:08:16,283 --> 01:08:18,885
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be $3.5 million per year.

872
01:08:20,545 --> 01:08:20,986
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

873
01:08:21,186 --> 01:08:24,368
[SPEAKER_03]: And question number eight, is that exclusion also?

874
01:08:25,028 --> 01:08:28,830
[SPEAKER_06]: Question number eight is also an override, and that amount is $4 million per year.

875
01:08:30,351 --> 01:08:30,991
[SPEAKER_03]: It's $4 million.

876
01:08:31,172 --> 01:08:32,512
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an override.

877
01:08:33,033 --> 01:08:33,353
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

878
01:08:33,773 --> 01:08:38,536
[SPEAKER_03]: Are the seniors exempt from this if any of these pass?

879
01:08:39,594 --> 01:08:48,317
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no provision in proposition two and a half law to exempt seniors beyond the exemptions generally allowed for the property tax, which the city already.

880
01:08:48,437 --> 01:08:52,218
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna I'm gonna repeat myself.

881
01:08:52,678 --> 01:08:58,920
[SPEAKER_03]: Most seniors are on fixed income and they have in trouble with this Biden inflation.

882
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:01,121
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really tough out there.

883
01:09:01,701 --> 01:09:02,901
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I have to say, sir.

884
01:09:04,102 --> 01:09:05,002
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. Castagnetti.

885
01:09:10,069 --> 01:09:11,669
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll go to the podium, name and address for the record, please.

886
01:09:11,689 --> 01:09:12,409
[SPEAKER_06]: You have three minutes.

887
01:09:12,870 --> 01:09:14,350
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, Bill Giglio, Winthrop Street.

888
01:09:14,890 --> 01:09:16,710
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks, George, for putting this on.

889
01:09:16,850 --> 01:09:28,533
[SPEAKER_12]: My question is, or my only fear or concern is, I think the way George, when I read this, was based for the seniors to get the information.

890
01:09:28,573 --> 01:09:33,754
[SPEAKER_12]: If we open this up to everybody and this place floods, then you have a bunch of seniors.

891
01:09:33,894 --> 01:09:35,754
[SPEAKER_12]: Then we have another meeting that could go on until,

892
01:09:36,687 --> 01:09:40,649
[SPEAKER_12]: however long people start fighting, you hit the gavel call for a 15 minute recess.

893
01:09:40,869 --> 01:09:43,310
[SPEAKER_12]: And then they're not getting the answers that they want.

894
01:09:43,370 --> 01:09:44,631
[SPEAKER_12]: Is there a way to separate?

895
01:09:45,051 --> 01:09:49,373
[SPEAKER_12]: Like I was very much in favor of just having the seniors.

896
01:09:49,453 --> 01:10:00,559
[SPEAKER_12]: I would, you know, if they come up here and it's six, seven o'clock at night and they're not getting their questions answered and then the lines out the door and then the height of that, I mean, we've all seen what can happen in these chambers.

897
01:10:01,223 --> 01:10:07,711
[SPEAKER_12]: with people bickering and fighting, and then that goes on for long, and now they don't get their answers that they're looking for.

898
01:10:08,072 --> 01:10:17,203
[SPEAKER_06]: Given the format of the event and what's been discussed by Councilor Scarpelli, I think what we can do is we can prioritize A, and I'm sure everyone in the room would be happy to do so,

899
01:10:17,861 --> 01:10:21,602
[SPEAKER_06]: get seniors seated in the front of the room, take their questions first.

900
01:10:22,702 --> 01:10:30,323
[SPEAKER_06]: And when it comes to the bickering and yelling, I can only do so much, but I will encourage everyone at the beginning of the meeting to keep it civil.

901
01:10:31,664 --> 01:10:35,824
[SPEAKER_06]: I think given the format of the event, we're gonna have to have slightly different rules.

902
01:10:35,844 --> 01:10:37,925
[SPEAKER_06]: I think keep questions a little bit shorter.

903
01:10:37,945 --> 01:10:43,486
[SPEAKER_06]: I would request also the answers from my fellow Councilors be kept as brief as possible.

904
01:10:44,026 --> 01:10:46,310
[SPEAKER_06]: and we can try to get through everybody in a timely manner.

905
01:10:46,390 --> 01:10:56,606
[SPEAKER_06]: But I will now that I'm aware of the request and the format, we'll take all of those factors into consideration and make sure that we hear from our seniors in a

906
01:10:57,850 --> 01:10:59,591
[SPEAKER_06]: respectful and prompt manner.

907
01:10:59,811 --> 01:11:08,875
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, given the format that we're talking about with a committee of the whole, we can't, uh, do we can't, the council can't host a public meeting and say only certain people can come.

908
01:11:09,696 --> 01:11:15,158
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I do think it is also a way around some of these questions that Councilor Scarpelli noted around the legal questions.

909
01:11:15,198 --> 01:11:17,640
[SPEAKER_06]: He's asked if we could have a private forum at the senior center.

910
01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:19,701
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems like that'll take some time.

911
01:11:19,741 --> 01:11:22,522
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this is a way to expedite the process and I think not a private

912
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:26,303
[SPEAKER_06]: Not necessarily private, but it's an open forum.

913
01:11:26,363 --> 01:11:28,405
[SPEAKER_06]: Would it be a, not a private, but not a council meeting?

914
01:11:28,445 --> 01:11:30,667
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, it's just an open forum.

915
01:11:31,408 --> 01:11:36,472
[SPEAKER_09]: It could be any member that has a background that can sit and meet with them.

916
01:11:36,532 --> 01:11:41,557
[SPEAKER_09]: It could be a override professional from the city or the state that would go in and talk with them.

917
01:11:41,597 --> 01:11:45,661
[SPEAKER_09]: But unfortunately, the mayor mentioned that we need legal representation.

918
01:11:46,266 --> 01:11:50,448
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, so I think this is the way within our authority we're able to accelerate this.

919
01:11:50,948 --> 01:11:52,689
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm gonna take all those factors into account.

920
01:11:53,129 --> 01:11:56,790
[SPEAKER_06]: I will plan for as best as I can to incorporate those factors.

921
01:11:57,511 --> 01:11:58,751
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

922
01:11:59,491 --> 01:12:00,712
[SPEAKER_06]: Just one second, I'm gonna go to Zoom.

923
01:12:01,812 --> 01:12:04,713
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll go to Paul on Zoom.

924
01:12:05,034 --> 01:12:06,254
[SPEAKER_06]: Name and address for the record, please.

925
01:12:06,274 --> 01:12:07,094
[SPEAKER_06]: You have three minutes.

926
01:12:11,916 --> 01:12:13,477
[SPEAKER_06]: Paul, I've asked you to unmute.

927
01:12:21,932 --> 01:12:22,833
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

928
01:12:23,293 --> 01:12:24,975
[SPEAKER_06]: I will go back to the podium.

929
01:12:24,995 --> 01:12:26,797
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see if we can get back to Paul in a minute.

930
01:12:27,398 --> 01:12:29,099
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sorry.

931
01:12:30,040 --> 01:12:30,441
[SPEAKER_19]: I did.

932
01:12:30,481 --> 01:12:31,242
[SPEAKER_19]: I came up here again.

933
01:12:31,542 --> 01:12:32,283
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm just two things.

934
01:12:32,323 --> 01:12:38,369
[SPEAKER_19]: If we had that at the senior center, would that be a lot that be accessible via zoom?

935
01:12:40,791 --> 01:12:42,972
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what the hybrid space is.

936
01:12:43,152 --> 01:12:51,174
[SPEAKER_19]: I do think it's important to have that on zoom for people that for whatever reason cannot get here, whether it's disability or whatever.

937
01:12:51,614 --> 01:13:03,358
[SPEAKER_19]: Also, um, I did speak to some of my, um, neighbors that are also senior citizens and one specifically who was struggling and she works, she lives in the family home by herself.

938
01:13:03,758 --> 01:13:06,779
[SPEAKER_19]: She works three jobs and she's,

939
01:13:08,121 --> 01:13:09,601
[SPEAKER_19]: she's having a really hard time.

940
01:13:09,641 --> 01:13:15,603
[SPEAKER_19]: So something like this is it's going to make her she even said, I'm not going to be able to live in Medford anymore.

941
01:13:16,363 --> 01:13:21,905
[SPEAKER_19]: Myself, I live alone, I have all the income that I have going towards the house.

942
01:13:21,985 --> 01:13:28,807
[SPEAKER_19]: So I just think it's what you're seeing here is not necessarily the people that aren't

943
01:13:30,703 --> 01:13:35,426
[SPEAKER_19]: involved that just some of them are working and they just can't attend these things.

944
01:13:35,746 --> 01:13:38,807
[SPEAKER_19]: So I do think that having it on Zoom is very important.

945
01:13:39,168 --> 01:13:42,369
[SPEAKER_19]: And again, I thank you for bringing this up and everyone working like this.

946
01:13:42,830 --> 01:13:50,454
[SPEAKER_19]: One other thing, the taxes that are the help that you had said, it's already established.

947
01:13:51,014 --> 01:13:58,238
[SPEAKER_19]: Is that something that can be brought up at this meeting for people like even me that aren't aware of what's available to us?

948
01:13:59,028 --> 01:13:59,829
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, yes.

949
01:13:59,909 --> 01:14:03,352
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I personally try to mention it every time we talk about taxes.

950
01:14:03,392 --> 01:14:04,873
[SPEAKER_06]: We mentioned it during the tax rate meeting.

951
01:14:05,314 --> 01:14:06,174
[SPEAKER_06]: We can keep mentioning it.

952
01:14:06,214 --> 01:14:13,341
[SPEAKER_06]: It is also, and I know you said you didn't have the computer, but it is available on the assessor's office website.

953
01:14:13,861 --> 01:14:17,024
[SPEAKER_06]: And I will, not necessarily for you, but for anyone watching,

954
01:14:18,144 --> 01:14:19,785
[SPEAKER_06]: The library is a great resource.

955
01:14:19,845 --> 01:14:24,046
[SPEAKER_06]: If you don't have a computer to access that information, it's open until 9 p.m.

956
01:14:24,086 --> 01:14:24,926
[SPEAKER_06]: most weekdays.

957
01:14:25,406 --> 01:14:30,988
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's a ton of computers thanks to that great project that for folks who may not otherwise be able to get that information.

958
01:14:31,008 --> 01:14:33,609
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just want to note that for anyone maybe watching on.

959
01:14:33,629 --> 01:14:35,029
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, thank you very much.

960
01:14:35,169 --> 01:14:35,449
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks.

961
01:14:37,890 --> 01:14:39,650
[SPEAKER_06]: Any further comments by members of the public?

962
01:14:39,670 --> 01:14:41,511
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to try Mr. Garrity one more time.

963
01:14:41,891 --> 01:14:42,211
[SPEAKER_06]: Paul?

964
01:14:43,513 --> 01:14:48,677
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to request to unmute you, and if you could click the button and give us your name and address for the record.

965
01:14:54,562 --> 01:14:57,585
[SPEAKER_06]: Paul, a pop-up should have just come on your computer asking you to unmute.

966
01:15:06,912 --> 01:15:10,274
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, do we have any other comments from members of the public or from members of the council?

967
01:15:10,414 --> 01:15:11,135
[SPEAKER_09]: If I can, Mr. President.

968
01:15:11,155 --> 01:15:11,935
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scarpelli.

969
01:15:11,975 --> 01:15:18,160
[SPEAKER_09]: Just so I'm clear, so what you brought up earlier, just to be clear, because I want to make sure that I'm not speaking out of turn.

970
01:15:18,620 --> 01:15:24,123
[SPEAKER_09]: So you met with the assessor, but the calculation wasn't part of the assessor's team, correct?

971
01:15:24,244 --> 01:15:25,084
[SPEAKER_09]: Just so I'm clear with that.

972
01:15:25,344 --> 01:15:26,125
[SPEAKER_06]: Which calculation?

973
01:15:26,185 --> 01:15:32,329
[SPEAKER_09]: The calculation that's being put out by the group that's, the four method group, the four yes group.

974
01:15:32,589 --> 01:15:41,682
[SPEAKER_06]: the calculation being that is both on the city website and that that is referenced by private group that is from the division of local services.

975
01:15:41,722 --> 01:15:42,564
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not the assessor.

976
01:15:42,804 --> 01:15:43,785
[SPEAKER_06]: Well in the assessor.

977
01:15:43,845 --> 01:15:45,728
[SPEAKER_06]: So the way it works is if you take the

978
01:15:48,156 --> 01:15:52,499
[SPEAKER_06]: the 7.5 million, and then you put the 2 million at that exclusion, that takes you to 9.5.

979
01:15:53,039 --> 01:15:59,584
[SPEAKER_06]: You go to the DLS website, which has the override calculator, and that will give you the override amount.

980
01:16:00,465 --> 01:16:10,353
[SPEAKER_06]: And then that is taken, the information for the address calculator is taken directly from the assessor's database, multiplied by the DLS calculator, and that's how you calculate the amount.

981
01:16:10,513 --> 01:16:11,393
[SPEAKER_09]: That's wonderful, Matt.

982
01:16:11,433 --> 01:16:17,198
[SPEAKER_09]: But the question I had was, because I want to make sure, because the emails that we have, when I

983
01:16:17,921 --> 01:16:42,837
[SPEAKER_09]: speak with the assessors, I don't wanna talk out of turn, because I hate to be called a liar, because that happens a lot lately, that what the assessor's words were, and an email, we'll get it for us, that they had no part of any calculations, and they do not have any of the calculations that normal communities, when they go through an override, they show a breakdown, and the breakdown says,

984
01:16:44,190 --> 01:16:48,231
[SPEAKER_09]: override ramifications or impact.

985
01:16:48,371 --> 01:16:51,412
[SPEAKER_09]: It would be single family homes, two family homes, three family homes.

986
01:16:51,872 --> 01:16:54,833
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause I have the email that states that it will not be ready.

987
01:16:55,954 --> 01:16:59,595
[SPEAKER_09]: Those type of calculations that we're seeing didn't come from his office.

988
01:16:59,615 --> 01:17:08,177
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just want to make sure when we meet, I don't want anybody to go around saying that this is contentious because I know the calculations and you're correct.

989
01:17:08,197 --> 01:17:11,638
[SPEAKER_09]: It's from the state and we understand that, but there's a lot of, right.

990
01:17:11,958 --> 01:17:13,259
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's a lot of variables

991
01:17:14,059 --> 01:17:21,154
[SPEAKER_09]: that aren't factored because I know firsthand because I sat with a resident.

992
01:17:22,113 --> 01:17:31,237
[SPEAKER_09]: that the calculations that are out there that state that his house is appraised at X, but is truly Y, it's not true.

993
01:17:31,277 --> 01:17:32,197
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not apples to apples.

994
01:17:32,217 --> 01:17:36,639
[SPEAKER_09]: So when I talked to the assessor, they said, of course not, because that's not tied in yet.

995
01:17:37,159 --> 01:17:46,623
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just want you to know that we wanna make sure when we come to the 15th that we're not spending too much time looking at or talking about, oh yeah, I'll tell him the truth, I'm not telling the truth.

996
01:17:46,703 --> 01:17:47,524
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wanna make sure.

997
01:17:48,124 --> 01:17:55,088
[SPEAKER_09]: The assessor was not part of any calculations with any financial group of task force here in the city.

998
01:17:55,529 --> 01:17:56,949
[SPEAKER_09]: That's their exact words.

999
01:17:56,989 --> 01:17:57,530
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you.

1000
01:17:58,050 --> 01:18:00,912
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, I think we're getting a bit into the

1001
01:18:03,348 --> 01:18:05,831
[SPEAKER_06]: specifics or minutiae of the issue.

1002
01:18:05,871 --> 01:18:07,132
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, that's not minutiae.

1003
01:18:07,253 --> 01:18:08,954
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the data is from the assessor.

1004
01:18:09,275 --> 01:18:11,858
[SPEAKER_06]: I've spoken with the assessor multiple times about the data.

1005
01:18:13,019 --> 01:18:16,403
[SPEAKER_06]: They did not do the multiplication, but the data is from them.

1006
01:18:16,823 --> 01:18:18,025
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's their tax rate.

1007
01:18:18,465 --> 01:18:19,485
[SPEAKER_06]: their assessed values.

1008
01:18:19,766 --> 01:18:26,468
[SPEAKER_06]: If there's an individual case where there's an error in the assessed value in the assessor's database, I could work with you and the assessor to correct that error.

1009
01:18:27,408 --> 01:18:33,750
[SPEAKER_06]: But all of the data is from our tax rates from the State Division of Local Services and from the assessor's database.

1010
01:18:34,091 --> 01:18:35,611
[SPEAKER_06]: But not the update assessments, correct?

1011
01:18:36,271 --> 01:18:36,491
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

1012
01:18:36,551 --> 01:18:39,392
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they're based on the assessments we have now, current year.

1013
01:18:39,512 --> 01:18:39,733
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

1014
01:18:40,033 --> 01:18:41,773
[SPEAKER_09]: So not the newest ones.

1015
01:18:42,313 --> 01:18:42,494
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

1016
01:18:42,634 --> 01:18:46,115
[SPEAKER_06]: I did speak with the assessor a couple of weeks ago, and he actually expects

1017
01:18:48,407 --> 01:18:50,330
[SPEAKER_06]: that next year's bills will increase.

1018
01:18:50,391 --> 01:18:55,139
[SPEAKER_06]: The normal increase will happen no matter what in assessments, not to be as bad as prior years.

1019
01:18:57,625 --> 01:19:01,287
[SPEAKER_06]: looking forward to those meetings on the tax rate and the assessed values.

1020
01:19:01,807 --> 01:19:03,328
[SPEAKER_06]: Any further questions or comments?

1021
01:19:03,348 --> 01:19:06,950
[SPEAKER_06]: Go to the podium one more time.

1022
01:19:07,090 --> 01:19:08,971
[SPEAKER_20]: Name and address.

1023
01:19:09,051 --> 01:19:14,494
[SPEAKER_20]: I just want to correct you, Mr. President, because you mentioned that the assessed value is $9.5 million.

1024
01:19:14,715 --> 01:19:18,277
[SPEAKER_20]: It cannot be $9.5 million because you're adding the $2 million for the bond.

1025
01:19:18,317 --> 01:19:19,377
[SPEAKER_20]: Where's the interest for the bond?

1026
01:19:19,457 --> 01:19:21,218
[SPEAKER_20]: The bond, we need to pay an interest on the bond.

1027
01:19:21,238 --> 01:19:22,879
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that includes the interest, the estimated annual.

1028
01:19:22,919 --> 01:19:23,520
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's a $30 million bond.

1029
01:19:26,342 --> 01:19:29,890
[SPEAKER_20]: over a 15 year period that gives you $2 million a year, where's the interest?

1030
01:19:30,030 --> 01:19:31,393
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't say over a 15 year period.

1031
01:19:32,416 --> 01:19:32,817
[SPEAKER_20]: What do you mean?

1032
01:19:33,358 --> 01:19:34,881
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't say it was over a 15 year period.

1033
01:19:36,098 --> 01:19:37,539
[SPEAKER_06]: It's until the bonds paid off.

1034
01:19:38,099 --> 01:19:41,120
[SPEAKER_06]: The $2 million includes debt service costs, yes.

1035
01:19:41,240 --> 01:19:44,262
[SPEAKER_20]: OK, so there's going to be banks involved in issuing this bond?

1036
01:19:44,502 --> 01:19:44,822
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1037
01:19:44,902 --> 01:19:47,483
[SPEAKER_20]: So that includes also the fees for the banks?

1038
01:19:47,703 --> 01:19:50,204
[SPEAKER_06]: It is the estimated debt service for a $30 million bond.

1039
01:19:50,284 --> 01:19:50,524
[SPEAKER_20]: OK.

1040
01:19:50,784 --> 01:20:00,449
[SPEAKER_20]: And then what Consuelo Scarpelli was saying, so the assessed values are going to be used for once the overrides and debt exclusions, they pass.

1041
01:20:01,710 --> 01:20:04,493
[SPEAKER_20]: when they become active, it's going to be based on 2023 values.

1042
01:20:04,513 --> 01:20:07,015
[SPEAKER_20]: So we have to make sure that residents understand that.

1043
01:20:07,956 --> 01:20:17,847
[SPEAKER_20]: So for example, the statutory 2.5% limit, Levi limit, forget about the overrides that we have, doesn't mean that your tax will not go up by more than 2.5%.

1044
01:20:18,287 --> 01:20:21,190
[SPEAKER_20]: Because that's just concluded on the overall

1045
01:20:22,051 --> 01:20:23,352
[SPEAKER_20]: property values for the whole city.

1046
01:20:23,632 --> 01:20:29,117
[SPEAKER_20]: So in my house, for example, like, you know, gets reassessed at a much higher value than what it was last year.

1047
01:20:30,138 --> 01:20:36,624
[SPEAKER_20]: My personal, even though the whole city is capped at 2.5, my personal property taxes could go up by more than 2.5.

1048
01:20:36,684 --> 01:20:38,746
[SPEAKER_20]: So the calculator that is being used

1049
01:20:40,567 --> 01:20:43,330
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not really, it could definitely be possible.

1050
01:20:43,390 --> 01:20:48,774
[SPEAKER_06]: It's probably actually going to be slightly lower because the tax rate's going to go down because the values are going to go up.

1051
01:20:48,794 --> 01:20:53,278
[SPEAKER_20]: We can agree that that value that I'm getting in the calculator is not exactly what I'm going to see.

1052
01:20:53,399 --> 01:20:55,601
[SPEAKER_06]: It will most likely actually be a little lower, you're correct.

1053
01:20:55,621 --> 01:20:58,123
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, well that's your take, but I just want to make it clear.

1054
01:20:58,163 --> 01:20:59,124
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that's what's happening.

1055
01:20:59,164 --> 01:21:02,306
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're correct, what happens with how Proposition 2.5 works is

1056
01:21:03,047 --> 01:21:06,051
[SPEAKER_06]: The total levy is increased by the limit amount.

1057
01:21:06,091 --> 01:21:07,713
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the numerator of our equation.

1058
01:21:07,853 --> 01:21:07,993
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

1059
01:21:08,193 --> 01:21:12,779
[SPEAKER_06]: The denominator of our equation is the total assessable assess taxable value.

1060
01:21:13,299 --> 01:21:15,482
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, total assessed value of taxable property.

1061
01:21:16,142 --> 01:21:16,343
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

1062
01:21:16,443 --> 01:21:18,065
[SPEAKER_06]: The total that denominator total

1063
01:21:18,605 --> 01:21:18,845
[SPEAKER_06]: that's

1064
01:21:36,510 --> 01:21:39,552
[SPEAKER_06]: in fiscal 25, if no override were to pass.

1065
01:21:39,852 --> 01:21:49,698
[SPEAKER_06]: So the override impact is actually likely to be less than it is on the calculator because of that impact, because the values are going up so much faster, but you're also correct.

1066
01:21:50,118 --> 01:21:51,839
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just the calculation for the whole city.

1067
01:21:52,339 --> 01:21:53,400
[SPEAKER_06]: Then you get the tax rate.

1068
01:21:53,580 --> 01:21:56,182
[SPEAKER_06]: The tax rate is then multiplied by your assessed value.

1069
01:21:56,722 --> 01:21:58,943
[SPEAKER_06]: And so yes, there's disparate impact.

1070
01:22:00,845 --> 01:22:01,886
[SPEAKER_06]: on different properties.

1071
01:22:02,326 --> 01:22:07,292
[SPEAKER_06]: The single family class, for example, has been going up in value much faster than other classes of property.

1072
01:22:08,593 --> 01:22:13,479
[SPEAKER_06]: Proposition two and a half is an incredibly complicated, convoluted law that is not a good way to set tax policy.

1073
01:22:13,879 --> 01:22:15,922
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very difficult for people to understand it.

1074
01:22:16,342 --> 01:22:18,304
[SPEAKER_06]: And it places these artificial limits that make it

1075
01:22:19,105 --> 01:22:21,206
[SPEAKER_06]: really are not grounded in any sort of economic science.

1076
01:22:21,266 --> 01:22:24,687
[SPEAKER_06]: They were just a fun number that people decided to pick in 1980 to get a law passed.

1077
01:22:24,787 --> 01:22:26,668
[SPEAKER_06]: So I completely agree with you.

1078
01:22:27,128 --> 01:22:28,769
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a convoluted, complicated law.

1079
01:22:28,789 --> 01:22:31,570
[SPEAKER_20]: No, I didn't say it was a convoluted, complicated law.

1080
01:22:31,610 --> 01:22:32,710
[SPEAKER_20]: I actually love Proposition 2.5.

1081
01:22:32,791 --> 01:22:38,433
[SPEAKER_20]: It actually keeps the government limited, and it makes sure that they use our money

1082
01:22:39,113 --> 01:22:41,794
[SPEAKER_20]: Properly and efficiently and they're very clear for you.

1083
01:22:41,814 --> 01:22:44,215
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's one opinion on well, that's my personal opinion.

1084
01:22:44,255 --> 01:22:47,136
[SPEAKER_20]: But you said like I said that I was a convoluted law.

1085
01:22:47,156 --> 01:22:51,437
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what Well, I think we can both agree that there's complications in the calculation.

1086
01:22:52,037 --> 01:22:53,238
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, not really.

1087
01:22:53,418 --> 01:22:56,459
[SPEAKER_20]: There are complications in the calculator that is being shown to resin.

1088
01:22:56,499 --> 01:22:57,199
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's that.

1089
01:22:57,279 --> 01:22:57,579
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1090
01:22:57,619 --> 01:22:57,959
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1091
01:22:57,999 --> 01:23:00,460
[SPEAKER_06]: But in your to answer your question specifically

1092
01:23:01,020 --> 01:23:05,202
[SPEAKER_06]: the tax rate in fiscal 25 is likely to be lower than the fiscal 24 rate.

1093
01:23:05,222 --> 01:23:11,105
[SPEAKER_20]: That's right, but you don't know what my assessed value is going to be in 2025, because it's a 2023 value and it's not the one being used in the calculator.

1094
01:23:11,525 --> 01:23:11,745
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

1095
01:23:11,825 --> 01:23:12,765
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's how it is every year.

1096
01:23:12,945 --> 01:23:13,105
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

1097
01:23:13,406 --> 01:23:13,586
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

1098
01:23:13,786 --> 01:23:15,947
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yep, it's pretty good estimate.

1099
01:23:15,987 --> 01:23:16,287
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1100
01:23:17,147 --> 01:23:18,928
[SPEAKER_06]: Any further questions on Zoom?

1101
01:23:19,248 --> 01:23:20,769
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to go to Marie Izzo.

1102
01:23:25,697 --> 01:23:26,858
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to unmute.

1103
01:23:26,958 --> 01:23:27,298
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.

1104
01:23:28,399 --> 01:23:29,540
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1105
01:23:30,001 --> 01:23:39,750
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to remind everyone, and thank you for being as civil as you are being in this conversation.

1106
01:23:39,830 --> 01:23:49,999
[SPEAKER_01]: And I appreciate that because really hard to listen to these, you know, sort of argumentative things going on regarding this, but I just want to remind everyone this is about

1107
01:23:51,482 --> 01:23:53,684
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm a senior, I'm on a fixed income.

1108
01:23:53,844 --> 01:23:55,545
[SPEAKER_01]: It is going to make a dent.

1109
01:23:55,805 --> 01:24:10,356
[SPEAKER_01]: However, you know, I think the other population we are simply not talking about is the students and the teachers and honestly about the civility of this city and the needs that we have that we have ignored.

1110
01:24:11,224 --> 01:24:16,610
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know how difficult it is, you know, to be running for office and having to raise tax.

1111
01:24:16,750 --> 01:24:17,851
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody likes taxes.

1112
01:24:18,352 --> 01:24:19,133
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to pay them.

1113
01:24:19,293 --> 01:24:21,535
[SPEAKER_01]: I pay them all the time and I hate every moment of it.

1114
01:24:21,615 --> 01:24:29,384
[SPEAKER_01]: However, I do understand that we have needs that we have ignored and are budgeting and that everything is increasing for everyone.

1115
01:24:30,345 --> 01:24:33,907
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes, there's more vulnerable as opposed to non-vulnerable.

1116
01:24:34,148 --> 01:24:37,670
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I can't afford my taxes, I will leave.

1117
01:24:37,831 --> 01:24:47,999
[SPEAKER_01]: And that doesn't mean anything other than I have choices because I have a million dollar home in Medford, like many of my other senior friends living and being overhoused in their homes.

1118
01:24:48,679 --> 01:24:54,244
[SPEAKER_01]: What's unfortunate is there's nowhere in Medford to go to, and that's a bigger deal for me than anything else.

1119
01:24:54,324 --> 01:25:03,853
[SPEAKER_01]: But in this two and a half override conversation, and that I have sat through many, many, many hours of this, and this is on public television.

1120
01:25:04,173 --> 01:25:11,198
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's on the public, the cable channels and people are listening to this and we're all gonna go and we're all gonna vote.

1121
01:25:11,799 --> 01:25:13,180
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that is sufficient.

1122
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:17,863
[SPEAKER_01]: And many times, you know, in this council in the past, it has said, you know, we have to educate ourselves.

1123
01:25:18,243 --> 01:25:22,146
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't handhold everyone into like, you know, trying to figure everything out.

1124
01:25:22,807 --> 01:25:24,007
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to impact us.

1125
01:25:24,167 --> 01:25:26,509
[SPEAKER_01]: It is, but we're going to have some positive outcomes.

1126
01:25:26,569 --> 01:25:28,070
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really all I have to say.

1127
01:25:28,150 --> 01:25:28,651
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1128
01:25:28,671 --> 01:25:30,132
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1129
01:25:32,090 --> 01:25:33,812
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll go to the podium, name and address for the record, please.

1130
01:25:33,832 --> 01:25:34,553
[SPEAKER_06]: You have three minutes.

1131
01:25:37,537 --> 01:25:39,379
[SPEAKER_08]: Richard Orlando, Winford Way.

1132
01:25:39,819 --> 01:25:41,281
[SPEAKER_08]: Just a point for clarification.

1133
01:25:41,622 --> 01:25:43,103
[SPEAKER_08]: There was a reference to the school committee.

1134
01:25:43,143 --> 01:25:51,814
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to understand, will the motion include a formal invitation to the mayor and school committee to that upcoming informational meeting?

1135
01:25:53,366 --> 01:25:54,146
[SPEAKER_06]: We can invite them.

1136
01:25:54,166 --> 01:25:57,149
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to schedule a meeting for them.

1137
01:25:57,649 --> 01:26:00,612
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, I'm just asking, will they be formally invited to participate?

1138
01:26:00,632 --> 01:26:01,332
[SPEAKER_08]: I will invite them, yes.

1139
01:26:01,633 --> 01:26:02,854
[SPEAKER_08]: Both the mayor and the school board.

1140
01:26:02,874 --> 01:26:03,854
[SPEAKER_06]: I will invite them to attend.

1141
01:26:04,495 --> 01:26:04,795
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1142
01:26:05,035 --> 01:26:05,276
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks.

1143
01:26:10,820 --> 01:26:14,083
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll try, oh, hands down.

1144
01:26:14,624 --> 01:26:16,125
[SPEAKER_06]: Any further comment by members in the room?

1145
01:26:17,106 --> 01:26:18,887
[SPEAKER_06]: Seeing none, I'll go back to Mr. Castagnetti.

1146
01:26:18,907 --> 01:26:20,669
[SPEAKER_06]: Name and address for the record, please.

1147
01:26:22,287 --> 01:26:25,409
[SPEAKER_03]: Castagnetti, Cushing Street, East Medford.

1148
01:26:25,729 --> 01:26:27,490
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for the extra 30 seconds.

1149
01:26:29,391 --> 01:26:36,915
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Bears, I beg to differ with you on your comment, the negative comment about when Prop 215 started in 1980.

1150
01:26:37,415 --> 01:26:48,401
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as I'm concerned, Barbara Anderson, rest her soul, did a great thing by limiting the state

1151
01:26:49,597 --> 01:27:09,635
[SPEAKER_03]: that the city from increasing our real estate tax levy more than 2.5 percent annually or else the city would go who knows to what percent 10 20 30 um and i think she she was great the law is flawed guarantee you because everyone should uh

1152
01:27:10,339 --> 01:27:15,543
[SPEAKER_03]: every owner occupy should get a savings and not have some have to pay.

1153
01:27:16,204 --> 01:27:20,327
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so I think she did a, she, she did a great thing.

1154
01:27:21,008 --> 01:27:22,990
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, again, rest his soul.

1155
01:27:23,870 --> 01:27:24,251
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1156
01:27:25,832 --> 01:27:26,252
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1157
01:27:30,796 --> 01:27:39,083
[SPEAKER_06]: Any further comment seeing none on the motion of councilor Scarpelli second by vice president Collins to refer

1158
01:27:39,673 --> 01:28:01,830
[SPEAKER_06]: This paper as amended to committee of the whole to amend the paper to include inviting residents and parents and to request that the Council on Aging, PTOs and community liaisons conduct outreach and that community liaisons are able to translate the city produced materials regarding the override and debt exclusion questions.

1159
01:28:04,872 --> 01:28:05,713
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1160
01:28:10,216 --> 01:28:10,536
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1161
01:28:26,565 --> 01:28:27,266
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Lazzaro?

1162
01:28:28,747 --> 01:28:28,987
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1163
01:28:29,667 --> 01:28:30,227
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Leming?

1164
01:28:31,248 --> 01:28:31,428
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1165
01:28:35,558 --> 01:28:36,179
[SPEAKER_10]: President Ferris.

1166
01:28:36,419 --> 01:28:36,739
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1167
01:28:38,100 --> 01:28:39,541
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Cohen.

1168
01:28:39,561 --> 01:28:40,582
[SPEAKER_06]: She said she votes yes.

1169
01:28:40,622 --> 01:28:41,543
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we gotta have a verbal.

1170
01:28:42,403 --> 01:28:42,644
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

1171
01:28:43,004 --> 01:28:44,945
[SPEAKER_21]: Sorry, my audio cut out and I couldn't hear the clerk.

1172
01:28:48,168 --> 01:28:50,630
[SPEAKER_06]: So the affirmative, none the negative, the motion passes as amended.

1173
01:28:50,650 --> 01:28:56,134
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually need Councilor Scrupley for you to take the chair for this one too.

1174
01:28:57,055 --> 01:28:57,355
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

1175
01:28:58,176 --> 01:29:00,618
[SPEAKER_06]: It's for my paper on the MCAS.

1176
01:29:17,128 --> 01:29:17,528
[SPEAKER_14]: It's right there.

1177
01:29:17,548 --> 01:29:20,610
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1178
01:29:20,630 --> 01:29:27,433
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, thank you.

1179
01:29:28,773 --> 01:29:40,399
[SPEAKER_09]: Next we have item 24-476, resolution to support question two, replacing the high stakes MCAS test graduation requirements for high school students.

1180
01:29:40,959 --> 01:29:42,000
[SPEAKER_09]: Council President Baez.

1181
01:29:43,580 --> 01:29:43,901
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1182
01:29:46,175 --> 01:29:49,739
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll just, uh, would you like me to, I can do it if you, unless you want to do it.

1183
01:29:50,180 --> 01:29:53,083
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I think this is, it's very powerful when you read it.

1184
01:29:53,163 --> 01:29:56,387
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you.

1185
01:29:56,767 --> 01:30:03,976
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, just, uh, the text is, uh, whereas access to high quality publicly funded education is a guaranteed right.

1186
01:30:04,517 --> 01:30:16,240
[SPEAKER_06]: written into the Massachusetts Constitution, and whereas the goal of public education is to teach students essential foundational skills such as reading, writing, and arithmetic, and to develop critical thinkers, engaged citizens, and lifelong learners.

1187
01:30:17,222 --> 01:30:40,383
[SPEAKER_06]: And whereas the bedrock of the Commonwealth's world-class public education system is strong, statewide standards that are uniform throughout our public schools, and whereas the MCAS is significantly limited in its ability to accurately and effectively measure whether students are meeting the Commonwealth standards and developing the skills they need to thrive after high school, and whereas the most effective measures of whether students are meeting our strong statewide standards in developing the skills they need to succeed in college, the workforce, and beyond,

1188
01:30:40,923 --> 01:30:45,846
[SPEAKER_06]: Our educator-led assessments such as projects, papers, tests, and group activities that are conducted throughout the school year.

1189
01:30:46,406 --> 01:31:00,674
[SPEAKER_06]: And whereas the punitive use of MCAS as a high school graduation requirement has restricted curriculum and shifted the focus of education in our public schools towards meeting a test score instead of fostering an environment of creativity, critical thinking, and real teaching and learning that helps students realize their full potential.

1190
01:31:01,154 --> 01:31:09,899
[SPEAKER_06]: And whereas pediatricians, researchers, and school Councilors have warned of the severe impact of high-stakes testing like the MCAS graduation requirement on students' mental health and well-being.

1191
01:31:10,379 --> 01:31:33,127
[SPEAKER_06]: and whereas standardized test requirements notoriously stack the deck against students of color, ESL students, and students with learning disabilities, and whereas using MCAS testing as a high school graduation requirement has prevented or delayed thousands of students from earning a diploma, thereby interrupting or derailing education or career plans with especially harmful impacts on students of color, low-income students, students with disabilities, and students for whom English is their second language.

1192
01:31:33,787 --> 01:31:37,769
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Medford City Council that we support question two,

1193
01:31:38,289 --> 01:31:42,131
[SPEAKER_06]: replacing the MCAS graduation requirement on the November 5th general election ballot.

1194
01:31:42,691 --> 01:31:45,373
[SPEAKER_09]: See, I'm already voting with you.

1195
01:31:47,574 --> 01:31:49,055
[SPEAKER_09]: So powerful.

1196
01:31:49,135 --> 01:31:49,815
[SPEAKER_09]: So thanks.

1197
01:31:49,895 --> 01:31:50,155
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1198
01:31:50,275 --> 01:31:54,197
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm sure you being in the schools, being a teacher, you've seen the impact.

1199
01:31:54,317 --> 01:31:58,639
[SPEAKER_06]: I was one of the early classes that had to pass the MCAS to graduate high school.

1200
01:32:00,669 --> 01:32:13,096
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of these requirements, you know, ours came into place from the Education Reform Act in the early 90s, but this was really blasted nationwide by the education reform movement under No Child Left Behind.

1201
01:32:14,177 --> 01:32:19,459
[SPEAKER_06]: At its peak, 35 states required a high-stakes standardized test to pass and graduate high school.

1202
01:32:19,479 --> 01:32:20,220
[SPEAKER_06]: You had to pass it.

1203
01:32:20,660 --> 01:32:21,741
[SPEAKER_06]: That's down to eight states.

1204
01:32:22,972 --> 01:32:24,753
[SPEAKER_06]: So it used to be 35, we're down to eight.

1205
01:32:24,833 --> 01:32:26,534
[SPEAKER_06]: We're one of the only eight who are left.

1206
01:32:28,035 --> 01:32:29,355
[SPEAKER_06]: And the reason is it doesn't work.

1207
01:32:29,996 --> 01:32:32,657
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't actually measure what we're trying to measure.

1208
01:32:33,317 --> 01:32:35,599
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't actually help anyone get anywhere.

1209
01:32:36,319 --> 01:32:49,326
[SPEAKER_06]: And it harms, particularly targeted harms at groups of students who maybe they passed all their classes, maybe they did all their projects, maybe they passed all their tests, maybe they have all their grades that they need to have, but they struggle with the test.

1210
01:32:50,250 --> 01:32:55,044
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't get a high school diploma, even though they passed all their classes and their teachers think they should get one.

1211
01:32:55,746 --> 01:32:56,107
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think

1212
01:32:57,210 --> 01:33:00,052
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, at the core, that's who we're trying to protect here.

1213
01:33:00,072 --> 01:33:06,055
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the most focused group that's gonna benefit from this, but I think it benefits everyone in the schools too.

1214
01:33:07,956 --> 01:33:24,505
[SPEAKER_06]: Not to have their classmates worried about anxiety about passing the test, not to have teachers feeling like they have to teach to the test, not to have students worried that even if they do everything right, there might be this one little thing that doesn't go the way they want it to go and they can't get their degree or their diploma.

1215
01:33:26,351 --> 01:33:29,892
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, for a lot of people, the MCAS is just some boring days.

1216
01:33:30,972 --> 01:33:33,293
[SPEAKER_06]: For some kids, it's the worst five days of their lives.

1217
01:33:33,813 --> 01:33:39,334
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think for any teacher, any student, it's a good activity that they feel at the end of it benefited their education.

1218
01:33:39,855 --> 01:33:43,576
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's why I think you shouldn't have the high stakes requirement on it.

1219
01:33:43,616 --> 01:33:46,636
[SPEAKER_06]: If it was up to me, maybe you'd go a different direction altogether.

1220
01:33:46,696 --> 01:33:48,117
[SPEAKER_06]: This question doesn't get rid of the test.

1221
01:33:48,937 --> 01:33:55,060
[SPEAKER_06]: You can, the assessment is still there so that we can punish teachers and districts if kids don't do great on it.

1222
01:33:55,480 --> 01:34:06,845
[SPEAKER_06]: So it doesn't go as far as I'd like it to go, being someone who's been in our schools and been an advocate for our schools and worked with our teachers, not just in Medford, but around the Commonwealth.

1223
01:34:08,166 --> 01:34:19,872
[SPEAKER_06]: So it doesn't go as far as I'd like to go, but it does hit that most difficult part of the MCAS, which is the high stakes requirement that really hurts specific groups of students and creates that anxiety and teach the test mentality.

1224
01:34:19,993 --> 01:34:24,495
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think it's great that it's on the ballot and I really hope it passes and I hope tonight we can endorse it.

1225
01:34:25,115 --> 01:34:26,456
[SPEAKER_06]: And our school committee endorsed it last week.

1226
01:34:26,696 --> 01:34:26,876
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1227
01:34:27,477 --> 01:34:27,957
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Callahan.

1228
01:34:28,968 --> 01:34:29,448
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you so much.

1229
01:34:30,029 --> 01:34:31,470
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for putting this on.

1230
01:34:32,872 --> 01:34:39,217
[SPEAKER_13]: You just said what I was going to say, which is it is important for people to understand this does not eliminate MCAS.

1231
01:34:39,778 --> 01:34:41,039
[SPEAKER_13]: Some people are confused about that.

1232
01:34:41,720 --> 01:34:44,743
[SPEAKER_13]: It simply removes it as a graduation requirement.

1233
01:34:45,744 --> 01:34:50,228
[SPEAKER_13]: I completely agree that it is really damaging as a graduation requirement.

1234
01:34:51,008 --> 01:34:52,610
[SPEAKER_13]: So just as long as people understand that.

1235
01:34:53,511 --> 01:34:53,731
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1236
01:34:55,660 --> 01:35:03,362
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, anyone else I just, as I think accounts of as they can scale and hope people sitting down out there is that but I'll be.

1237
01:35:04,302 --> 01:35:15,165
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm behind you 1000% with this initiative, I think as a former teacher, until you're sitting in a classroom, and you're working with a dedicated teacher who's bawling her eyes out.

1238
01:35:15,834 --> 01:35:25,780
[SPEAKER_09]: because you have a new ESL student that just moved to the city, to this country weeks ago, and that you have to try to explain to them what snow is.

1239
01:35:26,940 --> 01:35:43,130
[SPEAKER_09]: And knowing that impact, that it'll never succeed, and watching the pain, and realize that these are the questions that are leading decisions to what we're looking at as educators.

1240
01:35:44,289 --> 01:35:55,483
[SPEAKER_09]: I love the fact that I was a strong advocate for the portfolio format, where you really saw the growth of a student from beginning to end.

1241
01:35:56,318 --> 01:36:03,581
[SPEAKER_09]: And it made teachers, what we saw, it happened right in front of us, you took away the creativity away from teachers.

1242
01:36:04,061 --> 01:36:14,304
[SPEAKER_09]: And you took away so much talent because instead of them being creative to this individual student, individual classes, they had to focus on what this test forced you to do.

1243
01:36:16,741 --> 01:36:20,422
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been a long time coming, like you said, the graduation.

1244
01:36:20,782 --> 01:36:33,824
[SPEAKER_09]: My daughter Gianna, she is a Dean's List student, 4.0 student in college, 3.5 in high school, had the most difficult time passing the MCAS.

1245
01:36:34,344 --> 01:36:35,445
[SPEAKER_09]: So I saw it firsthand.

1246
01:36:35,465 --> 01:36:42,046
[SPEAKER_09]: A young lady that had to fight a speech impediment and understanding

1247
01:36:43,194 --> 01:36:51,144
[SPEAKER_09]: what the limitations that you have as a teacher to help a student with a disability is another most painful process to watch.

1248
01:36:51,184 --> 01:36:53,086
[SPEAKER_09]: So I agree with you.

1249
01:36:54,068 --> 01:37:01,637
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope we can go a step further and moving forward this initiative further to look at maybe using testing as one mechanism.

1250
01:37:02,498 --> 01:37:09,880
[SPEAKER_09]: but also followed up with some sort of portfolio process where you can really see our kids shine and our teachers shine.

1251
01:37:09,920 --> 01:37:13,381
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would, I appreciate that.

1252
01:37:13,421 --> 01:37:15,462
[SPEAKER_09]: So do we have any questions on Zoom?

1253
01:37:15,562 --> 01:37:22,283
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks like Julie, oops, Julie Roberto.

1254
01:37:23,184 --> 01:37:27,785
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi, I guess I don't have a question I was gonna give my little testimony.

1255
01:37:27,825 --> 01:37:29,065
[SPEAKER_15]: Is it time for that?

1256
01:37:31,546 --> 01:37:31,666
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

1257
01:37:32,428 --> 01:37:35,518
[SPEAKER_09]: Name and address for the record 

1258
01:37:37,379 --> 01:37:42,542
[SPEAKER_15]: uh Julia Roberto, central Ave. I feel like maybe I don't really need to give my testimony based off of everything you guys are saying.

1259
01:37:43,022 --> 01:37:47,625
[SPEAKER_15]: But regardless, I support yes on two and would be wicked grateful for this to pass here tonight.

1260
01:37:48,366 --> 01:37:53,129
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm an educator at a public school and also a former public school student in Massachusetts.

1261
01:37:53,930 --> 01:38:04,377
[SPEAKER_15]: And I support yes on two because I believe it's important to hold our students to high standards throughout each and every day of their academic career, not just solely on a few days of testing.

1262
01:38:05,357 --> 01:38:14,823
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm supporting us on to means that we're supporting the asks that every student shows mastery of our standards in English, math, science, etc.

1263
01:38:14,843 --> 01:38:19,906
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm also ensures that we have an inclusive education system here.

1264
01:38:20,706 --> 01:38:28,030
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, you know, with the last resolution, we talked a lot about vulnerable populations and this MCAS test really affects our vulnerable student populations.

1265
01:38:28,770 --> 01:38:38,555
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, standardized tests are proven to be biased or inaccessible, uh, against low-income students, students of color, students who are English language learners, um, and students who have learning differences.

1266
01:38:39,436 --> 01:38:47,360
[SPEAKER_15]: So I guess overall, I just really ask that, you know, we all show our students that we know they can demonstrate their intelligence every day.

1267
01:38:49,021 --> 01:38:49,281
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1268
01:38:53,567 --> 01:38:56,802
[SPEAKER_09]: Next we have at the podium name and address of the record.

1269
01:38:56,822 --> 01:38:58,590
[SPEAKER_09]: You have 33 minutes and three days.

1270
01:39:00,450 --> 01:39:04,613
[SPEAKER_20]: see what happens.

1271
01:39:05,174 --> 01:39:10,718
[SPEAKER_20]: So I went to high school in Latin America, so I didn't take the MCAS, obviously.

1272
01:39:10,738 --> 01:39:16,542
[SPEAKER_20]: So I'm just going to talk in general about some of the points that I saw in President Bayer's resolution.

1273
01:39:17,022 --> 01:39:25,188
[SPEAKER_20]: So the first one is that I think if there is a particular problem with the MCAS, for example, some students

1274
01:39:26,770 --> 01:39:37,698
[SPEAKER_20]: might need a little bit of extra help or maybe an exam that has some modifications, then let's address those definitely, but let's not eliminate the MCAS as a graduation requirement.

1275
01:39:38,339 --> 01:39:41,821
[SPEAKER_20]: So the second one is that I'm going to use Councilor Tseng's term.

1276
01:39:41,861 --> 01:39:43,022
[SPEAKER_20]: So I'm an immigrant voter.

1277
01:39:43,603 --> 01:39:44,984
[SPEAKER_20]: I was born in Latin America.

1278
01:39:45,004 --> 01:39:46,605
[SPEAKER_20]: I came here when I was 18 years old.

1279
01:39:47,045 --> 01:39:49,787
[SPEAKER_20]: I went to public high school in Argentina.

1280
01:39:50,148 --> 01:39:51,449
[SPEAKER_20]: I actually went to vocational school.

1281
01:39:52,029 --> 01:39:54,431
[SPEAKER_20]: I didn't have a formal English instruction.

1282
01:39:54,491 --> 01:39:55,372
[SPEAKER_20]: We only had technical

1283
01:39:56,052 --> 01:39:56,332
[SPEAKER_20]: English.

1284
01:39:57,112 --> 01:40:02,233
[SPEAKER_20]: And so I became a US citizen about two years ago.

1285
01:40:02,633 --> 01:40:04,013
[SPEAKER_20]: So I'm definitely an immigrant voter.

1286
01:40:04,194 --> 01:40:10,095
[SPEAKER_20]: And obviously, as you can tell by my accent, I'm an English as a single language person.

1287
01:40:10,855 --> 01:40:18,936
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think some of this writing definitely sets, and I'm Latino, so it sets like underrepresented minorities like me back.

1288
01:40:19,556 --> 01:40:23,217
[SPEAKER_20]: I definitely feel that when I was in high school, again, public high school in Argentina,

1289
01:40:23,937 --> 01:40:28,222
[SPEAKER_20]: And I had the ambition to come to school here in the US.

1290
01:40:28,622 --> 01:40:40,535
[SPEAKER_20]: If I had read things like this, for example, about how much of a disadvantage I was by not having been taught in English, having to have learned English mostly by myself, et cetera, I would have said, you know what?

1291
01:40:40,615 --> 01:40:41,335
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not even worth it.

1292
01:40:41,376 --> 01:40:42,677
[SPEAKER_20]: Why am I going to go through all this pain?

1293
01:40:43,298 --> 01:40:43,998
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's just give up.

1294
01:40:44,859 --> 01:40:45,300
[SPEAKER_20]: It's too hard.

1295
01:40:45,900 --> 01:40:50,682
[SPEAKER_20]: And I just think we need to be, again, talking through my own experience, we have to be a little bit careful.

1296
01:40:52,122 --> 01:41:01,125
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, Latinos, we can do it, we can put the work, we can put the effort, we can achieve it, and everyone out there can achieve their own ambitions and their own dreams if they work hard enough.

1297
01:41:01,145 --> 01:41:03,066
[SPEAKER_20]: So I want to make that clear.

1298
01:41:03,226 --> 01:41:05,026
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's not set ourselves back.

1299
01:41:07,625 --> 01:41:15,955
[SPEAKER_20]: The third point I wanna make is that, so I think that these high stakes exams, definitely we all went through them, SAT, things like this.

1300
01:41:15,975 --> 01:41:17,096
[SPEAKER_20]: So there...

1301
01:41:20,885 --> 01:41:27,311
[SPEAKER_20]: they, you know, we go through a lot of stress, but at the same time, it's part of the learning process, right?

1302
01:41:27,331 --> 01:41:34,897
[SPEAKER_20]: So we're gonna go through a lot of very stressful situations later on in life, particular situation might even be much more stressful than just like a graduation test.

1303
01:41:35,257 --> 01:41:45,906
[SPEAKER_20]: So I take this as like kind of a requirement that I had to go through as a student to, you know, make me capable of leading with life later on.

1304
01:41:46,787 --> 01:41:48,428
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'm almost done.

1305
01:41:48,648 --> 01:42:01,035
[SPEAKER_20]: So the fourth one actually is that I think like having a uniform standard graduation requirement is actually useful to be used as a benchmark to see whether the tax dollars are actually being spent efficiently in the public school system.

1306
01:42:01,375 --> 01:42:02,796
[SPEAKER_20]: There might be other better assessments.

1307
01:42:03,176 --> 01:42:04,757
[SPEAKER_20]: I just think that this is one of them.

1308
01:42:04,937 --> 01:42:09,600
[SPEAKER_20]: And I would like to, if we get rid of this one, to see how we can have a uniform

1309
01:42:10,020 --> 01:42:17,785
[SPEAKER_20]: because some of the money that I pay to the state goes into public education as well, to make sure that our taxes are being used efficiently.

1310
01:42:18,445 --> 01:42:30,513
[SPEAKER_20]: And the last one that I want to say is that I want to mention a little bit the hypocrisy of the city council, because for this, they're very concerned about people for whom English is their second language.

1311
01:42:31,114 --> 01:42:37,758
[SPEAKER_20]: And when the participation time limit was reduced from five to three minutes, I didn't see this point being discussed even once.

1312
01:42:38,178 --> 01:43:07,638
[SPEAKER_20]: okay and then for people like me that have a very strong accent I've gotten feedback that you know you speak too fast we cannot understand you and I just wish again I don't I think I don't absolutely don't want any preferential treatment we should all be treated exactly the same but I wish that this English as a second language issue had been discussed back then and maybe you know the impact that this could have on some of the immigrants that come and speak at city council who have been considered thank you so much.

1313
01:43:08,685 --> 01:43:09,371
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Gaston.

1314
01:43:10,277 --> 01:43:10,877
[SPEAKER_20]: Council Bias.

1315
01:43:11,137 --> 01:43:11,557
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1316
01:43:12,237 --> 01:43:36,602
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think to at least one of Gaston's points, I just wanted to add in the, I think that the passage of this, a yes vote on this, which I'm hoping we'll see on November 5th, will really encourage the state legislature to take more seriously the MCEIA or IEA, I can't remember, it's the mass commission on alternative, it's basically the alternative educational assessment, innovative educational assessment, I think it is MCEIA.

1317
01:43:39,642 --> 01:43:49,649
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they're looking at that portfolio requirement, bringing that back so that we can have a statewide requirement that's not a high stakes standardized test.

1318
01:43:50,069 --> 01:43:52,931
[SPEAKER_06]: And I really hope that that innovation will go in there.

1319
01:43:53,231 --> 01:44:00,136
[SPEAKER_06]: And I also just want to direct some folks, similar to Councilor Scarpelli's experience, there's a Boston Globe article yesterday, I think,

1320
01:44:00,596 --> 01:44:01,557
[SPEAKER_06]: about Deb McCarthy.

1321
01:44:02,618 --> 01:44:04,320
[SPEAKER_06]: Deb is someone I count as a close friend.

1322
01:44:04,340 --> 01:44:05,781
[SPEAKER_06]: We organized together for many years.

1323
01:44:06,381 --> 01:44:12,887
[SPEAKER_06]: She was a teacher in Hall forever, and she started off early on in MCAS, and you can read this in the story.

1324
01:44:13,328 --> 01:44:16,751
[SPEAKER_06]: She was the MCAS data czar for her school.

1325
01:44:16,811 --> 01:44:22,636
[SPEAKER_06]: She thought it was going to be doing these great things, helping get that data out, helping to provide more knowledge to

1326
01:44:25,613 --> 01:44:27,175
[SPEAKER_06]: to teachers to help them teach better.

1327
01:44:27,956 --> 01:44:36,464
[SPEAKER_06]: She did that for a few years, then she started to see the impacts to the point where a few years ago she became what she called, and some other teachers in the district, conscientious objectors.

1328
01:44:36,504 --> 01:44:39,446
[SPEAKER_06]: They refused to proctor the MCAS exam.

1329
01:44:40,247 --> 01:44:48,095
[SPEAKER_06]: And they were sitting with the kids who had been opted out of the MCAS exam as well and working with them on those days.

1330
01:44:49,776 --> 01:44:53,319
[SPEAKER_06]: She's now vice president of the MTA statewide, a huge leader on this issue.

1331
01:44:53,399 --> 01:45:08,991
[SPEAKER_06]: But that profile, I think, is really a great example of a teacher who was teaching before MCAS started, knows what it was like, thought MCAS was going to be this good thing, really gave it a chance, saw the negative impacts, and then has been organizing to try to bring us to a different standard for a really long time.

1332
01:45:09,011 --> 01:45:17,178
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that is just exactly the story people need to hear to get behind this question, the experience of this in our schools, what our teachers have seen.

1333
01:45:17,658 --> 01:45:19,139
[SPEAKER_06]: what the students have been impacted.

1334
01:45:19,259 --> 01:45:25,081
[SPEAKER_06]: So I refer people to take a look at that Deb McCarthy profile in the Boston Globe sometime in the last couple of days.

1335
01:45:25,401 --> 01:45:26,101
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1336
01:45:26,201 --> 01:45:29,442
[SPEAKER_09]: We do have Mr. Cassinetti.

1337
01:45:30,463 --> 01:45:31,803
[SPEAKER_09]: You have name and address.

1338
01:45:31,843 --> 01:45:34,124
[SPEAKER_09]: We have your... Go ahead.

1339
01:45:40,506 --> 01:45:42,347
[SPEAKER_09]: You have to unmute, Mr. Cassinetti.

1340
01:45:43,247 --> 01:45:44,067
[SPEAKER_03]: Unmuted, I think.

1341
01:45:44,447 --> 01:45:44,707
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1342
01:45:45,648 --> 01:45:46,148
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep, you're good.

1343
01:45:47,307 --> 01:45:49,188
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1344
01:45:50,928 --> 01:45:58,850
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanna say I'm always against testing, to be honest with you, pretty much all my life.

1345
01:45:59,811 --> 01:46:06,352
[SPEAKER_03]: And the only thing is I'm just hoping this doesn't go further to the top and down of America.

1346
01:46:07,093 --> 01:46:07,913
[SPEAKER_03]: Good luck, people.

1347
01:46:09,233 --> 01:46:09,533
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1348
01:46:11,114 --> 01:46:11,634
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Tseng.

1349
01:46:12,932 --> 01:46:13,272
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1350
01:46:13,532 --> 01:46:23,480
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I think it's very natural have nuanced takes on standardized tests, um, you know, there there's so many, there are different levels, there are different occasions where these questions apply to.

1351
01:46:23,880 --> 01:46:31,406
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's really important when we're looking at a ballot referendum question to look at the text right there and the text right there is about MCAS's graduation requirement.

1352
01:46:33,047 --> 01:46:34,228
[SPEAKER_07]: the MCAS will still exist.

1353
01:46:34,408 --> 01:46:51,440
[SPEAKER_07]: And in fact, something that a lot of residents, not just the Medford, but a lot of residents across the state don't know is that there are other ways that teachers are using now that, you know, some of them are state run, some of them are from schools, but there are ways that teachers are tracking student growth and student progress.

1354
01:46:52,280 --> 01:46:54,942
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a test, an alternative test.

1355
01:46:55,243 --> 01:47:01,427
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty different from MCAS, but it is still a standardized way to measure growth.

1356
01:47:02,167 --> 01:47:08,549
[SPEAKER_07]: being offered in our schools, offered, I believe, three times a year, at least in middle schools.

1357
01:47:08,809 --> 01:47:11,490
[SPEAKER_07]: This is from my conversation with middle school teachers.

1358
01:47:11,930 --> 01:47:14,551
[SPEAKER_07]: So that, you know, that rigor is still very much there.

1359
01:47:15,571 --> 01:47:20,852
[SPEAKER_07]: When we look at who exactly is being denied graduation from MCAS,

1360
01:47:23,348 --> 01:47:32,295
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's important to note that 75% of those who failed MCAS are people who are also not meeting standards already set by their school district.

1361
01:47:32,856 --> 01:47:38,120
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, you know, rigor is the worry, then that's a major data point to consider.

1362
01:47:38,160 --> 01:47:40,582
[SPEAKER_07]: But then the question leads to what is that other 25%?

1363
01:47:42,063 --> 01:48:00,385
[SPEAKER_07]: And we see very clearly in the data that that other 25% actually tends to be English as second language students who actually, when they sit down with a translator, work through the exams, actually pass the exams very well, but aren't accustomed to how we do

1364
01:48:01,265 --> 01:48:04,187
[SPEAKER_07]: high stakes testing here in Massachusetts or in this country.

1365
01:48:05,087 --> 01:48:08,008
[SPEAKER_07]: And so there's a cultural barrier there, a language barrier.

1366
01:48:09,309 --> 01:48:15,111
[SPEAKER_07]: What's great is that our teachers, and I know you know this, won't let anyone fall behind.

1367
01:48:16,272 --> 01:48:19,333
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a dedication to them, it's a duty, it's a vocation.

1368
01:48:20,354 --> 01:48:22,034
[SPEAKER_07]: It's also part of their job description.

1369
01:48:22,995 --> 01:48:30,398
[SPEAKER_07]: And so this is a measure I feel comfortable supporting, and I would urge our residents to vote for it as well.

1370
01:48:31,001 --> 01:48:31,321
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1371
01:48:31,581 --> 01:48:43,987
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, to follow up with that council president bears, I think that when MCAS started the biggest issue with the teachers, where the teachers weren't really involved, it was politicians and bureaucrats was it, and there was a huge gap.

1372
01:48:44,208 --> 01:48:53,212
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, so I think now you're seeing, um, hopefully waking up and, you know, look at different options when we're assessing our children.

1373
01:48:53,772 --> 01:48:59,175
[SPEAKER_09]: So on the motion council bears second by council Callahan, uh, Mr. Clerk,

1374
01:49:00,484 --> 01:49:00,964
[SPEAKER_09]: call the roll.

1375
01:49:01,985 --> 01:49:02,305
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1376
01:49:03,465 --> 01:49:03,846
[SPEAKER_09]: How's that?

1377
01:49:05,186 --> 01:49:05,546
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm ready.

1378
01:49:08,227 --> 01:49:09,488
[SPEAKER_11]: You didn't say please.

1379
01:49:09,568 --> 01:49:10,448
[SPEAKER_11]: It's please call the roll.

1380
01:49:10,468 --> 01:49:10,749
[SPEAKER_10]: I allow that.

1381
01:49:10,809 --> 01:49:11,169
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1382
01:49:11,209 --> 01:49:11,289
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1383
01:49:11,549 --> 01:49:11,689
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1384
01:49:11,769 --> 01:49:11,949
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1385
01:49:12,049 --> 01:49:12,229
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1386
01:49:12,269 --> 01:49:12,389
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1387
01:49:12,449 --> 01:49:12,549
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1388
01:49:32,393 --> 01:49:36,495
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, seven, the affirmative zero and the negative motion passes.

1389
01:49:37,235 --> 01:49:38,556
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I take this home for my wife?

1390
01:49:38,616 --> 01:49:40,277
[SPEAKER_09]: I can Dina, please.

1391
01:49:41,497 --> 01:49:42,397
[SPEAKER_09]: It's so powerful.

1392
01:49:43,278 --> 01:49:45,999
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I know I don't want to let it go though.
