1
00:00:00,131 --> 00:00:00,772
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello everybody.

2
00:00:00,812 --> 00:00:04,457
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the meeting of the Medford Historical Commission, May 13th, 2024.

3
00:00:10,486 --> 00:00:16,292
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna read, call the meeting to order at 7.05 p.m., read the governor's statement.

4
00:00:16,853 --> 00:00:28,085
[SPEAKER_04]: On March 29, 2023, Governor Healey signed into law a supplemental budget bill, among which other things extended the temporary provisions pertaining to the open meeting law to March 31, 2025.

5
00:00:30,948 --> 00:00:42,802
[SPEAKER_04]: Specifically, this extension allows public bodies to continue holding meetings remotely without a quorum of the public body physically present at a meeting location and to provide adequate alternative access to remote meetings.

6
00:00:42,842 --> 00:00:46,547
[SPEAKER_04]: The language does not make any other substance changes to open meeting law.

7
00:00:47,007 --> 00:01:09,515
[SPEAKER_04]: So for those joining us or wanting to follow us along at home, you can go to www.medfordhistoricalcommission.org, go to the news section where our agenda is posted along with all of the relevant information for tonight's meeting, and of course this meeting will be broadcast on Medford's community media and will be available after the fact.

8
00:01:11,188 --> 00:01:14,011
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, we have a pretty packed agenda this evening.

9
00:01:15,153 --> 00:01:29,090
[SPEAKER_04]: The very first thing up on there is 27 Allmont Street preferably preserved hearing to recap this building was found to be significant at last meeting, meaning that it is.

10
00:01:31,215 --> 00:01:32,996
[SPEAKER_04]: significance means one of three things.

11
00:01:33,016 --> 00:01:51,930
[SPEAKER_04]: It either has or has a pending listing on the National Register of Historic Places, is listed on the Massachusetts Register of Historic Places, or was 75 years or older and which was determined by the commission to be significant either because it is importantly associated with one or more historic

12
00:01:52,030 --> 00:02:10,588
[SPEAKER_04]: persons or events or with the broad architectural, cultural, political, economic, or social history of the Commonwealth, or it is historically or architecturally important in terms of period style, method of building construction, or its association with an important architect or builder, either by itself or in the context of a group of buildings.

13
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:15,873
[SPEAKER_04]: So as a result, this building is having a public hearing to determine whether or not

14
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:23,421
[SPEAKER_04]: the demolition of the historic resource is detrimental to the resources of the city of Medford.

15
00:02:24,002 --> 00:02:25,003
[SPEAKER_04]: And I see your hand up.

16
00:02:25,203 --> 00:02:25,944
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you have a question?

17
00:02:25,964 --> 00:02:30,789
[SPEAKER_04]: No, okay.

18
00:02:34,485 --> 00:02:46,854
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so with that being said, I will take a motion from the historical commissioners to get the discussion started and open the public hearing for public comment.

19
00:02:47,694 --> 00:02:57,641
[SPEAKER_04]: And then once the public has finished commenting, we'll close, have any final comments from the commissioners, make our motions and move forward accordingly.

20
00:02:58,522 --> 00:03:01,844
[SPEAKER_04]: Commissioners, can I have a motion please in regards to 27 Allmont?

21
00:03:03,401 --> 00:03:05,082
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll make a motion to start the discussion.

22
00:03:10,646 --> 00:03:11,227
[SPEAKER_06]: And a second.

23
00:03:25,136 --> 00:03:27,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, motion's been made and seconded to start the discussion.

24
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:37,931
[SPEAKER_04]: So commissioners, do you guys want to start with discussion of preferably preserved status for the building and then we'll open it up to public comment?

25
00:03:38,732 --> 00:03:40,934
[SPEAKER_07]: Excuse me, Ryan, who seconded?

26
00:03:42,436 --> 00:03:42,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Doug?

27
00:03:43,297 --> 00:03:43,918
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, thanks Doug.

28
00:03:52,255 --> 00:03:57,400
[SPEAKER_04]: Eleni, why don't you start with, cause you made the motion to open the discussion and we'll go from there.

29
00:03:58,361 --> 00:04:00,283
[SPEAKER_04]: If not, I can, I can read.

30
00:04:00,303 --> 00:04:02,885
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want me to recap why we found the building significant?

31
00:04:03,025 --> 00:04:03,286
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

32
00:04:03,366 --> 00:04:08,991
[SPEAKER_03]: Could you, cause I don't, I don't know if I was, I missed the last meeting and I'm a new commission member.

33
00:04:09,031 --> 00:04:10,513
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if I was here for this discussion.

34
00:04:11,312 --> 00:04:22,167
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, so this is a really interesting building, and it's a pre-1855 resource.

35
00:04:22,347 --> 00:04:27,014
[SPEAKER_04]: And in the city of Medford, there are probably less than

36
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:29,777
[SPEAKER_04]: 3,000 pre-1900 resources.

37
00:04:29,917 --> 00:04:31,358
[SPEAKER_04]: Half of those date to before 1855.

38
00:04:31,459 --> 00:04:35,843
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a very important time and they are rare and diminishing.

39
00:04:36,624 --> 00:04:42,731
[SPEAKER_04]: So the commission really focuses on that pre-1855 date and looks at buildings really closely.

40
00:04:43,592 --> 00:04:47,056
[SPEAKER_04]: It has architectural significance for its style and

41
00:04:47,296 --> 00:04:48,677
[SPEAKER_04]: method of building construction.

42
00:04:48,697 --> 00:04:54,461
[SPEAKER_04]: It has an open conveyance of its social history by looking at the architecture.

43
00:04:54,501 --> 00:05:00,425
[SPEAKER_04]: You can tell exactly who it was built for and the type of people that worked, lived in the building.

44
00:05:01,346 --> 00:05:05,809
[SPEAKER_04]: It has a known builder and let's see what else.

45
00:05:06,009 --> 00:05:10,412
[SPEAKER_04]: And its history mirrors that of the surrounding neighborhoods.

46
00:05:10,532 --> 00:05:12,894
[SPEAKER_04]: So it has ties to shipbuilding as a

47
00:05:15,667 --> 00:05:18,369
[SPEAKER_04]: early shipbuilding family and the neighborhood too as well.

48
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:22,592
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the basic ovary summary of this building.

49
00:05:24,173 --> 00:05:31,739
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say that it still looks like it maintains a lot of its architectural integrity.

50
00:05:31,799 --> 00:05:39,224
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks pretty unique maybe compared to some of the buildings that are surrounding it.

51
00:05:39,244 --> 00:05:40,124
[SPEAKER_03]: I would

52
00:05:47,116 --> 00:05:48,958
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely advocate for keeping the building.

53
00:05:48,978 --> 00:05:51,980
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what the developers' plans are for this.

54
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,241
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if anyone knows yet.

55
00:05:53,622 --> 00:05:56,364
[SPEAKER_04]: This is just total demolition.

56
00:05:56,684 --> 00:05:57,765
[SPEAKER_03]: Just total demolition.

57
00:05:58,065 --> 00:05:58,466
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

58
00:06:00,407 --> 00:06:03,310
[SPEAKER_03]: Have they stated any type of justification for it?

59
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:05,111
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, are there structural issues with the building?

60
00:06:05,952 --> 00:06:09,675
[SPEAKER_04]: It just says that there's structural issues, but nothing in detail.

61
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:10,656
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

62
00:06:16,029 --> 00:06:18,471
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, I think I would support a demolition delay.

63
00:06:21,553 --> 00:06:24,274
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, thanks.

64
00:06:24,795 --> 00:06:25,635
[SPEAKER_04]: Doug, you want to go next?

65
00:06:26,736 --> 00:06:26,896
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

66
00:06:26,936 --> 00:06:30,458
[SPEAKER_08]: I missed the last meeting, but I did catch up and read the form B earlier today.

67
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:41,125
[SPEAKER_08]: When I read the meeting minutes that Peter put together, I was not surprised that it was a 4-0 vote to sign a certificate because I was unfamiliar with this bill.

68
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:45,942
[SPEAKER_08]: But it just jumped out off the page about being how unique it is.

69
00:06:47,283 --> 00:06:49,963
[SPEAKER_08]: And the details that there is kind of amazing.

70
00:06:50,043 --> 00:06:53,865
[SPEAKER_08]: So it wasn't a tough call to, I'm sure, last meeting to make it significant.

71
00:06:53,885 --> 00:06:59,846
[SPEAKER_08]: And I would continue that we walk down this path to pause it for a while and see what the possibilities are.

72
00:06:59,906 --> 00:07:04,748
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe they're trying to propose three townhomes on this site, I believe.

73
00:07:04,768 --> 00:07:06,468
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's a separate issue we can take up later.

74
00:07:07,649 --> 00:07:07,789
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

75
00:07:09,189 --> 00:07:09,489
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

76
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:11,570
[SPEAKER_04]: Ed, you want to go next?

77
00:07:14,831 --> 00:07:21,313
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, I guess for me, I can understand the architectural significance in that area.

78
00:07:23,974 --> 00:07:38,940
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, the question is, which either comes up today or comes up during process based on the application is, can this structure be saved in its current form at all?

79
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,321
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're not, at this point,

80
00:07:43,161 --> 00:07:45,224
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not completely fully informed.

81
00:07:45,244 --> 00:07:47,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, the issue is going to come before us one way or the other.

82
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:55,817
[SPEAKER_05]: Either it comes before us today or comes before us during the process, given what can happen during the 18 month period.

83
00:07:56,638 --> 00:08:00,203
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess I'm still have a few points of curiosity.

84
00:08:03,013 --> 00:08:05,635
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think that's a, that's a valid point.

85
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:18,886
[SPEAKER_04]: And if, you know, certainly something that should be explored during the discussion of mitigation, if a delay is placed on the building, that's one of the things that we would certainly want to see if they wanted to discuss how the building can't be reused.

86
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:24,150
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, we always encourage people to focus on the reuse of the building.

87
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:27,412
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, finding the feasibility, that's one of the things that they'll just have to do.

88
00:08:27,433 --> 00:08:31,616
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, Peter.

89
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:39,582
[SPEAKER_07]: Agreed, I think this one has a lot of its architectural integrity still intact.

90
00:08:41,443 --> 00:08:48,487
[SPEAKER_07]: The interior photographs also showed that it has a lot of this interior detail attached.

91
00:08:49,207 --> 00:08:57,332
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the notice of intent or whatever did talk about problems with foundations tilted,

92
00:08:58,842 --> 00:09:03,485
[SPEAKER_07]: walls and stuff, but every house from this area has tilted walls, I feel so.

93
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:15,492
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, I would like to see some attempt at keeping or, you know, developing the site

94
00:09:17,145 --> 00:09:21,269
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, harmoniously with the building, try to keep some part of it or something.

95
00:09:21,329 --> 00:09:28,977
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's, it's kind of a little architectural jewel in that it's got so much of its, you know, fabric intact.

96
00:09:29,057 --> 00:09:35,844
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would like to try to see if it could be somehow incorporated into the new design.

97
00:09:35,864 --> 00:09:38,887
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all for me.

98
00:09:39,467 --> 00:09:39,627
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

99
00:09:40,048 --> 00:09:40,268
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

100
00:09:42,535 --> 00:09:51,021
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so we're going to open up to public comment portion of the hearing.

101
00:09:51,241 --> 00:10:03,009
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you'd like to speak on this particular matter, either for or against, if you would just raise your hand and I will call on you as I see you.

102
00:10:03,029 --> 00:10:07,452
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just need you to state the name and address for the record.

103
00:10:14,617 --> 00:10:15,097
[SPEAKER_04]: Isaiah.

104
00:10:16,318 --> 00:10:18,358
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, everyone, my name is Isaiah Schlonegger.

105
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:21,360
[SPEAKER_01]: I live at 29 Allmont Street, so right next door.

106
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:32,044
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to say, I mean, for preserving the house, I think it's, we knew the previous owner very well.

107
00:10:33,144 --> 00:10:36,065
[SPEAKER_01]: And he took very well, very good care of the house.

108
00:10:36,525 --> 00:10:38,706
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of always maintained it really well.

109
00:10:39,206 --> 00:10:41,907
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is a nice house.

110
00:10:41,987 --> 00:10:43,188
[SPEAKER_01]: And in thinking of like,

111
00:10:44,817 --> 00:10:51,741
[SPEAKER_01]: When you demolish a building, there's generally some sort of disrepair, but this house is very, very well taken care of.

112
00:10:51,821 --> 00:10:55,482
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is a very unique house on our street too.

113
00:10:55,843 --> 00:11:01,385
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've just put my favor is keeping it as is or preserving it if we can.

114
00:11:02,246 --> 00:11:02,446
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

115
00:11:02,986 --> 00:11:06,488
[SPEAKER_04]: And Isaiah, just to clarify, uh, what was the number of your house on Ed's Palmont?

116
00:11:06,968 --> 00:11:07,348
[SPEAKER_01]: Two nine.

117
00:11:07,869 --> 00:11:08,449
[SPEAKER_01]: Two nine.

118
00:11:08,849 --> 00:11:09,049
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

119
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:10,570
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

120
00:11:14,115 --> 00:11:14,635
[SPEAKER_04]: Anybody else?

121
00:11:19,896 --> 00:11:26,178
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, seeing none, I'm gonna close the public comment portion for 27 Allmont Street.

122
00:11:26,258 --> 00:11:29,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Commissioners, any final thoughts on the matter?

123
00:11:29,478 --> 00:11:41,521
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, hearing none, I'll take a motion for, I'll take a motion for preferably preserved status now if somebody wants to make one.

124
00:11:45,142 --> 00:11:46,102
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought we had a motion.

125
00:11:46,742 --> 00:11:49,523
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a motion to start discussion, which is what we did.

126
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:50,363
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, OK.

127
00:11:51,003 --> 00:11:54,304
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought that was a motion to find preferably preserved, but.

128
00:11:54,444 --> 00:12:00,305
[SPEAKER_04]: Melanie, do you want to change it to preferably preserved status so we can move forward with that?

129
00:12:00,465 --> 00:12:01,505
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, absolutely.

130
00:12:01,525 --> 00:12:04,366
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll change the motion to preserve status.

131
00:12:06,246 --> 00:12:10,327
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll second.

132
00:12:11,948 --> 00:12:13,208
[SPEAKER_04]: Doug Carr, second.

133
00:12:14,252 --> 00:12:16,253
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, motions have been made and seconded.

134
00:12:17,094 --> 00:12:21,337
[SPEAKER_04]: I will go around as I see people starting with, yeah, Melanie?

135
00:12:24,719 --> 00:12:24,959
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

136
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:26,600
[SPEAKER_04]: And Ed?

137
00:12:29,142 --> 00:12:29,442
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

138
00:12:29,942 --> 00:12:30,322
[SPEAKER_04]: And Doug?

139
00:12:31,243 --> 00:12:31,483
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

140
00:12:31,983 --> 00:12:32,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Peter?

141
00:12:32,864 --> 00:12:33,124
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

142
00:12:33,624 --> 00:12:35,746
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, motion passes four to zero.

143
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:55,034
[SPEAKER_04]: So there will be a demo delay for up to 18 months, but the commission will convene a subcommittee to reach out to the owner to see if we can start discussion on mitigating the demolition and what form that might take.

144
00:12:56,968 --> 00:13:01,749
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, this concludes the public hearing for 27 Allmont Street.

145
00:13:01,909 --> 00:13:10,951
[SPEAKER_04]: So we will move forward into the commission's regular business meeting, starting with a determination of significance for 18 Wedgmere Road.

146
00:13:11,871 --> 00:13:17,532
[SPEAKER_04]: I reiterated the reasoning for determination of significance at the beginning of the public hearing.

147
00:13:18,633 --> 00:13:24,034
[SPEAKER_04]: So commissioners, I will welcome a motion for

148
00:13:25,957 --> 00:13:29,318
[SPEAKER_04]: significance for or against to kickstart discussion?

149
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,000
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

150
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,521
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

151
00:13:40,502 --> 00:13:42,483
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll make a motion to find.

152
00:13:46,064 --> 00:13:46,785
[SPEAKER_07]: What's the address?

153
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:49,686
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, 18, 18 Wedgmere Road.

154
00:13:51,346 --> 00:13:51,987
[SPEAKER_07]: Significant.

155
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:55,688
[SPEAKER_04]: And a second.

156
00:14:00,945 --> 00:14:01,525
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll second.

157
00:14:01,545 --> 00:14:07,968
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, Peter, if you want to start discussion.

158
00:14:08,688 --> 00:14:08,989
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

159
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:21,854
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, this house is it's it's the same plan as my house, so and I feel like my house is significant, so I even though this one is.

160
00:14:23,415 --> 00:14:25,336
[SPEAKER_07]: Covered with vinyl signing.

161
00:14:29,518 --> 00:14:30,318
[SPEAKER_07]: I do feel like.

162
00:14:32,107 --> 00:14:41,612
[SPEAKER_07]: It merits a look at just because it's near and dear to me, even though the plan is reversed.

163
00:14:42,793 --> 00:14:47,656
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think underneath the vinyl siding, there might be some excellent detail.

164
00:14:47,676 --> 00:14:54,059
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what the interior looks like, but that's my reasoning.

165
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,001
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not super keen on the house.

166
00:14:59,622 --> 00:15:00,323
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's kind of,

167
00:15:02,498 --> 00:15:08,181
[SPEAKER_07]: Typical bungalow house that there's a lot of them like this in our neighborhood this one's in my neighborhood.

168
00:15:09,202 --> 00:15:18,687
[SPEAKER_07]: there's four or five or six of them that have the almost exact same plane plan in my neighborhood so somebody must have developed these all at a similar time, I think.

169
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:32,872
[SPEAKER_07]: And it does have some association with that, you know, the Stearns estate and the shipbuilding industry, et cetera.

170
00:15:33,052 --> 00:15:36,633
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's kind of where I am at this moment.

171
00:15:39,655 --> 00:15:39,935
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

172
00:15:40,635 --> 00:15:41,015
[SPEAKER_04]: So Lenny.

173
00:15:42,576 --> 00:15:45,077
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I have a question.

174
00:15:45,797 --> 00:15:47,278
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it does look like

175
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:54,202
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe the vinyl siding is new, but the general form of the building is still intact.

176
00:15:55,003 --> 00:15:59,726
[SPEAKER_03]: I was looking at the images, and it just looks like it's maintained that same shape.

177
00:15:59,746 --> 00:16:01,848
[SPEAKER_03]: There are no visible additions or changes.

178
00:16:03,569 --> 00:16:10,093
[SPEAKER_03]: Ryan, do you know roughly how many more bungalows from this era in the 1920s still exist?

179
00:16:10,313 --> 00:16:13,035
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it a disappearing resource in Medford?

180
00:16:18,921 --> 00:16:35,475
[SPEAKER_04]: I use the number 3,000 for pre-1900 resources, but the city up until maybe, I don't know, like 10 years ago or something had some number like 18,000 homes, single and double, you know, two family homes.

181
00:16:36,115 --> 00:16:46,784
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, some living, you know, some of that is apartment living, but literally in the 1910s, 20s and 30s, we built probably, you know,

182
00:16:48,986 --> 00:16:53,609
[SPEAKER_04]: 5,000 to 10,000 homes over that period.

183
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:58,513
[SPEAKER_04]: Of that, I would say this is a fairly common style building.

184
00:16:58,553 --> 00:16:59,473
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of them.

185
00:17:00,454 --> 00:17:08,239
[SPEAKER_04]: Their form is kind of disappearing, but I wouldn't say that this is the last one at all in any way, shape, or form.

186
00:17:08,259 --> 00:17:09,020
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of them.

187
00:17:10,087 --> 00:17:20,355
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know, I think there is an argument that can be made to preserve it because, you know, so many buildings of this era, the form can get changed quite a bit through, you know, additions here or there.

188
00:17:22,236 --> 00:17:24,638
[SPEAKER_03]: And this seems pretty intact to me, so.

189
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:35,146
[SPEAKER_03]: And I do like the connections, the historical connections to, again, like shipbuilding and the Stearns Estate and sort of like the wider network of Medford history, I think is important.

190
00:17:38,028 --> 00:17:38,288
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

191
00:17:40,175 --> 00:17:42,395
[SPEAKER_08]: Doug?

192
00:17:42,736 --> 00:17:45,196
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'm intrigued by this.

193
00:17:45,876 --> 00:17:52,957
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess I'm more open to, for the perfect preserve, to look at design alternatives for this house.

194
00:17:52,997 --> 00:18:00,019
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there is a way to sensitively add, which I believe they're trying to do, a second floor, a full second floor to this house.

195
00:18:00,499 --> 00:18:06,980
[SPEAKER_08]: It would be a massive change, it's significant, but we can, that's a couple of steps down the road.

196
00:18:09,133 --> 00:18:13,494
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess my instincts are pure preservation, unlike the previous house.

197
00:18:13,614 --> 00:18:18,375
[SPEAKER_08]: I was, you know, I think that house would be great if we could actually keep it intact.

198
00:18:18,715 --> 00:18:32,159
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't know if we can, but this one, I guess I'm a little bit more open to looking at alternatives that might alter the house in probably a significant way for a lot of people, but still trying to maintain some of the character.

199
00:18:32,419 --> 00:18:37,380
[SPEAKER_08]: We've seen a bunch of houses do that over the last couple of years, you know, add a full second floor and try to

200
00:18:38,455 --> 00:18:47,420
[SPEAKER_08]: maintain some integrity and in some ways restore what was lost with the siding and other detail that might've been removed over the years.

201
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:52,984
[SPEAKER_08]: So I voted for significance, but I think it's slightly different than the previous commissioners did.

202
00:18:54,525 --> 00:18:56,026
[SPEAKER_07]: And I would agree with that, Doug.

203
00:18:57,527 --> 00:19:02,029
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not, their plan is just to raise the roof.

204
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:03,950
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not a total demo.

205
00:19:04,331 --> 00:19:06,292
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think a sympathetic

206
00:19:09,613 --> 00:19:11,875
[SPEAKER_07]: design could be okay.

207
00:19:12,415 --> 00:19:17,159
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I also agree.

208
00:19:17,199 --> 00:19:33,311
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that, you know, I'm, it seems like for the purposes of this discussion, it's, you know, to determine whether this building has some historical significance or not, which I do think it does, but that doesn't mean that, you know, we're not open to change in the future once we see the plan.

209
00:19:33,471 --> 00:19:34,952
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a good point, Doug.

210
00:19:37,294 --> 00:19:37,534
[SPEAKER_05]: And Ed?

211
00:19:38,667 --> 00:19:42,508
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, you know, I look at this strictly from a social history point of view.

212
00:19:43,788 --> 00:19:46,369
[SPEAKER_05]: The Stearns estate was subdivided a long time ago.

213
00:19:47,069 --> 00:19:50,049
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think, again, that's an important piece of the city's history.

214
00:19:51,630 --> 00:20:04,752
[SPEAKER_05]: Nonetheless, this looks like a raise the roof application, which means I doubt that anything is going to take, I think this will resolve in a lot sooner than 18 months, I would hope.

215
00:20:06,073 --> 00:20:08,053
[SPEAKER_05]: But at this point,

216
00:20:09,496 --> 00:20:12,958
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, it's been our practice to sort of keep this going until we hear more from the owner.

217
00:20:14,239 --> 00:20:25,026
[SPEAKER_05]: And I, you know, at that point, at that point, again, from a social history perspective, and as also something of a neighbor, you know, I think you can at least go to the next, you can go to hearing.

218
00:20:26,967 --> 00:20:27,127
Great.

219
00:20:28,848 --> 00:20:29,708
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, thank you.

220
00:20:31,309 --> 00:20:33,971
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion's been made and seconded for significance.

221
00:20:34,091 --> 00:20:38,474
[SPEAKER_04]: If there's nothing else, we can move forward with that vote.

222
00:20:40,478 --> 00:20:44,824
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, seeing none, I'll go around and call it as I see it.

223
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:46,266
[SPEAKER_04]: Starting with Doug?

224
00:20:47,567 --> 00:20:47,788
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

225
00:20:48,869 --> 00:20:49,330
[SPEAKER_04]: And Ed?

226
00:20:50,351 --> 00:20:50,591
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

227
00:20:51,332 --> 00:20:51,813
[SPEAKER_04]: And Eleni?

228
00:20:52,514 --> 00:20:52,754
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

229
00:20:53,775 --> 00:20:54,296
[SPEAKER_04]: And Peter?

230
00:20:54,997 --> 00:20:55,237
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

231
00:20:56,127 --> 00:20:58,708
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so for zero approved.

232
00:20:59,449 --> 00:21:09,594
[SPEAKER_04]: So we will file the letter with the city clerk will reach out to the building owner, get them to post the sign with and pay for the legal ad.

233
00:21:10,514 --> 00:21:12,535
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll move forward with the public hearing next month.

234
00:21:13,656 --> 00:21:17,898
[SPEAKER_08]: Brian, where they have anyone have the owners are here, obviously, right?

235
00:21:20,653 --> 00:21:21,113
[SPEAKER_07]: at this meeting?

236
00:21:21,774 --> 00:21:22,594
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure.

237
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:26,937
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they were, but I don't see him now.

238
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:31,439
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I think they have left.

239
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:41,906
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll reach out to them and let them know of next steps and then we can have them come and talk about the plans for their renovation at next meeting.

240
00:21:43,987 --> 00:21:45,288
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, moving forward.

241
00:21:45,308 --> 00:21:49,010
[SPEAKER_04]: Next on the agenda is 9 Trout Avenue.

242
00:21:50,655 --> 00:21:59,522
[SPEAKER_04]: Commissioners, I'll take a motion for ninth row for significance or not.

243
00:22:06,147 --> 00:22:09,950
[SPEAKER_08]: I will make a motion to find this not significant.

244
00:22:15,454 --> 00:22:15,914
[SPEAKER_04]: And a second.

245
00:22:17,135 --> 00:22:17,736
[SPEAKER_08]: Second.

246
00:22:17,756 --> 00:22:18,917
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

247
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:21,510
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, Doug, you got it.

248
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:21,910
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead.

249
00:22:22,931 --> 00:22:41,318
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I looked at this, the form B, and I think there is nothing about this particular two families struck me as having a whole or of a certain character or quality that a potential

250
00:22:43,972 --> 00:22:45,013
[SPEAKER_08]: could potentially improve.

251
00:22:45,133 --> 00:22:51,116
[SPEAKER_08]: It would change the, again, change the masking a little bit, but I think there's actually a chance to kind of reinvent this house.

252
00:22:51,156 --> 00:22:59,460
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't think it rises to the level I normally think of when I'm thinking of, you know, a significance that potentially perfectly deserves.

253
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:04,303
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's where I stand based on the form B. Great.

254
00:23:04,603 --> 00:23:07,144
[SPEAKER_05]: And Ed?

255
00:23:07,325 --> 00:23:12,007
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, from a social history point of view is sort of interesting, again, you know,

256
00:23:12,838 --> 00:23:20,464
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think this is a house which we use to cast the neighborhood an aspect, though.

257
00:23:20,624 --> 00:23:25,227
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, there's just, you know, it's nothing particularly significant as its own.

258
00:23:25,508 --> 00:23:35,775
[SPEAKER_05]: We're really, again, talking about a raise the roof, but I'm not sure there's anything which is distinctive to stop that or make it worth going to war over.

259
00:23:35,795 --> 00:23:40,639
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, you know, this is a neighborhood

260
00:23:42,448 --> 00:23:46,511
[SPEAKER_05]: which is to very great extent subdivision small workman's homes.

261
00:23:47,492 --> 00:23:50,034
[SPEAKER_05]: This is not the best, you know, this is not the best example.

262
00:23:50,074 --> 00:23:53,656
[SPEAKER_05]: It has really nothing more than having been built in the 20s.

263
00:23:55,798 --> 00:23:58,600
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm happy to support Doug's motion as written.

264
00:24:00,642 --> 00:24:00,922
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

265
00:24:01,782 --> 00:24:04,685
[SPEAKER_04]: Eleni, anything to add?

266
00:24:06,566 --> 00:24:07,307
[SPEAKER_03]: Not much.

267
00:24:07,427 --> 00:24:10,329
[SPEAKER_03]: I do think I was looking at the photos there, you know,

268
00:24:12,067 --> 00:24:15,229
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems like a lot of the original detail might have been stripped away.

269
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:24,936
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Ed, I do appreciate the social history, especially, you know, I live in a building like this that was built in the same time.

270
00:24:26,237 --> 00:24:39,167
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a two family and I think that, you know, this typology, I think it's, you know, very unique to Medford and this region and I just,

271
00:24:40,565 --> 00:24:42,266
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't think there's enough there to keep it.

272
00:24:42,346 --> 00:24:45,308
[SPEAKER_03]: I do appreciate that it's being replaced with another multifamily.

273
00:24:46,208 --> 00:24:53,272
[SPEAKER_03]: So kind of keeping the typology the same, or at least it looks like a multifamily in the renderings.

274
00:24:54,953 --> 00:24:55,594
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it is.

275
00:24:56,034 --> 00:24:56,494
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

276
00:24:58,155 --> 00:25:02,297
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, I think that the two family nature of it will still be there.

277
00:25:03,058 --> 00:25:04,519
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll just look slightly different.

278
00:25:04,539 --> 00:25:05,179
[SPEAKER_03]: So.

279
00:25:08,575 --> 00:25:13,776
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't find anything that still exists in this building to be of particular significance.

280
00:25:13,796 --> 00:25:17,918
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, thank you.

281
00:25:18,978 --> 00:25:19,358
[SPEAKER_04]: And Peter?

282
00:25:20,878 --> 00:25:24,199
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I agree with the other Commissioner's points.

283
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:37,283
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that the building could use a facelift and be modernized and still be used as a two-family.

284
00:25:39,901 --> 00:25:47,023
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't see enough there either to think that it's significant.

285
00:25:49,004 --> 00:25:49,224
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

286
00:25:50,124 --> 00:25:50,405
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

287
00:25:52,905 --> 00:26:01,268
[SPEAKER_04]: With nothing else, and everybody has said their comments, I'll move forward with the motion as I see you starting.

288
00:26:01,668 --> 00:26:07,250
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a reminder, Doug made a motion to find that this building is not significant and add second in it.

289
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:08,831
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll start with you, Doug.

290
00:26:10,047 --> 00:26:12,048
[SPEAKER_08]: So a vote of no means not significant, correct?

291
00:26:12,488 --> 00:26:14,989
[SPEAKER_04]: A vote of yes means no significance.

292
00:26:15,029 --> 00:26:16,729
[SPEAKER_04]: So you made the motion that way.

293
00:26:17,489 --> 00:26:18,690
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why I'm clarifying.

294
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:21,591
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, yes for non-significance.

295
00:26:22,391 --> 00:26:22,931
[SPEAKER_04]: And Peter?

296
00:26:24,111 --> 00:26:25,472
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes for non-significance.

297
00:26:25,912 --> 00:26:26,352
[SPEAKER_04]: And Ed?

298
00:26:28,133 --> 00:26:29,353
[SPEAKER_04]: Non-significant, yes.

299
00:26:29,833 --> 00:26:30,313
[SPEAKER_04]: And Eleni?

300
00:26:31,014 --> 00:26:32,614
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes for non-significance.

301
00:26:33,054 --> 00:26:35,575
[SPEAKER_04]: So four, zero, not significant.

302
00:26:38,093 --> 00:26:44,103
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so Jen and I will work on a letter for that one and get that one off of the table.

303
00:26:45,801 --> 00:26:53,563
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, next up, we are gonna receive a couple of demolition applications, but things are going to switch around a little bit.

304
00:26:53,643 --> 00:27:10,287
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so just to give some updates, I did a little bit of research on 85 Morton Avenue, and according to the building department in their records, the building was constructed in 1967, so it is not eligible for review.

305
00:27:10,627 --> 00:27:15,608
[SPEAKER_04]: So commissioners, I will take a motion to pass on review because it is not eligible because of

306
00:27:15,748 --> 00:27:16,008
[SPEAKER_04]: age.

307
00:27:16,809 --> 00:27:25,773
[SPEAKER_05]: Move to move move to reject the application for 85 Morton as being not within our jurisdiction.

308
00:27:27,434 --> 00:27:27,834
[SPEAKER_03]: Second.

309
00:27:35,718 --> 00:27:36,539
[SPEAKER_04]: Lenny second.

310
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:40,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, commissioners.

311
00:27:40,481 --> 00:27:42,562
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll go around as I see you, Ed.

312
00:27:44,102 --> 00:27:45,223
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Doug.

313
00:27:46,356 --> 00:27:46,616
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

314
00:27:48,197 --> 00:27:48,457
[SPEAKER_04]: Peter.

315
00:27:49,797 --> 00:27:50,137
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

316
00:27:50,938 --> 00:27:51,418
[SPEAKER_04]: And Eleni.

317
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:52,158
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

318
00:27:52,738 --> 00:27:54,639
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, 4-0 rejected.

319
00:27:55,459 --> 00:27:56,820
[SPEAKER_07]: And what was that date?

320
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:56,820
1967.

321
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:58,540
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

322
00:28:08,361 --> 00:28:11,063
[SPEAKER_04]: So Attorney Desmond, we're all set on that property.

323
00:28:12,064 --> 00:28:15,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Next up, we'll receive the application for 38 Pearl Attorney Desmond.

324
00:28:15,826 --> 00:28:23,531
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, we did not get a response back by Thursday, and that's the posting deadline for the commission's agenda.

325
00:28:23,551 --> 00:28:25,633
[SPEAKER_04]: So we can only accept the application, and then we'll

326
00:28:26,808 --> 00:28:29,189
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a quick question in that regard.

327
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:38,355
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a way then that we could waive the significance hearing and move straight to the public hearing?

328
00:28:38,375 --> 00:28:47,420
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I believe looking at the Form A and the Form B, I don't think there's, I'd be surprised if there was any question from the board as to whether or not this would move forward.

329
00:28:48,982 --> 00:28:49,703
[SPEAKER_00]: to that hearing.

330
00:28:49,763 --> 00:28:55,068
[SPEAKER_00]: And just in terms of time, I don't know if that's something that can be done in this instance.

331
00:28:55,088 --> 00:28:56,589
[SPEAKER_07]: Which property are we talking about?

332
00:28:56,749 --> 00:28:57,010
[SPEAKER_04]: 38 Pearl.

333
00:29:02,335 --> 00:29:05,678
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure, to be perfectly frank.

334
00:29:06,278 --> 00:29:08,681
[SPEAKER_04]: I honestly think that that would be a question for

335
00:29:10,663 --> 00:29:22,653
[SPEAKER_04]: The city's solicitor, who is KP law, I believe at this point, I don't we have never had a situation where we skip significance and go right to preferably preserve status.

336
00:29:24,054 --> 00:29:30,299
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, just in terms of timing, you know, and looking at the form a that was provided, this is, you know.

337
00:29:32,543 --> 00:29:38,951
[SPEAKER_00]: In consideration for national register of historic, so I don't know that this would be a situation where.

338
00:29:39,993 --> 00:29:41,575
[SPEAKER_00]: The board would would pass on it.

339
00:29:42,076 --> 00:29:47,403
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, I couldn't get a hold of my client until later in that day and make sure that he was going to be available.

340
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:51,592
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, let's let's let's do this.

341
00:29:52,252 --> 00:29:53,953
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's accept the application.

342
00:29:54,013 --> 00:29:54,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's start with that.

343
00:29:54,913 --> 00:30:03,057
[SPEAKER_04]: And then let's tentatively schedule the public hearing under the assumption that the commission would determine the building significance.

344
00:30:03,297 --> 00:30:15,685
[SPEAKER_04]: What we could do is I guess we could publish the public hearing, determine significance at the beginning of that hearing, and then move right to the public hearing so that we can get the comments and do them back to back.

345
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:23,310
[SPEAKER_04]: The only stipulation is that we have to post the public hearing within 14 days.

346
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:29,434
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't see why we couldn't do both of those at the same time, provided we give the public adequate notice.

347
00:30:32,932 --> 00:30:47,684
[SPEAKER_05]: that as long as we have the consent of the applicant to go through, do both at once, and they comply with notice of hearing and the posting of the billboard, I don't see why there'd be a problem.

348
00:30:48,665 --> 00:30:52,728
[SPEAKER_05]: And we don't take comment during significance hearings anyway.

349
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:55,491
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, right.

350
00:30:56,533 --> 00:30:56,693
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

351
00:30:56,733 --> 00:31:01,114
[SPEAKER_04]: That's mainly to determine whether the building warrants, um, additional discussion.

352
00:31:01,134 --> 00:31:07,716
[SPEAKER_04]: And if the owners themselves and their representatives are asking for that hearing, we might as well just move forward with it.

353
00:31:08,276 --> 00:31:09,256
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm comfortable with that.

354
00:31:09,376 --> 00:31:16,278
[SPEAKER_04]: If folks want to make a motion to approve the application and tentatively file the, um,

355
00:31:18,397 --> 00:31:28,140
[SPEAKER_04]: legal notice for the public hearing under the assumption that next meeting will have the significance hearing and then the public hearing immediately following that if it's significant.

356
00:31:30,261 --> 00:31:35,603
[SPEAKER_08]: Before you make a motion, I'm sorry to cut you off, I just have a question.

357
00:31:35,883 --> 00:31:37,483
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't disagree with your approach here.

358
00:31:37,904 --> 00:31:42,985
[SPEAKER_08]: My question is, why would we do this all the time?

359
00:31:43,465 --> 00:31:47,707
[SPEAKER_08]: What would prevent us from doing this for every single property that came before us?

360
00:31:48,577 --> 00:32:02,830
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, if, if we, we try to do it as a two step process, just because it requires us to post the legal ad if the hearing is warranted, but not everybody in building would warrant a hearing.

361
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:04,031
[SPEAKER_04]: So, for example, the trout.

362
00:32:04,832 --> 00:32:10,035
[SPEAKER_04]: building that we just turned down doesn't necessarily warrant a public hearing after the fact.

363
00:32:10,076 --> 00:32:21,483
[SPEAKER_04]: So we could do it if, you know, if we are asked by building owners, I guess, if they just want to assume that we're going to find the building significant and compress the process down.

364
00:32:22,283 --> 00:32:28,928
[SPEAKER_04]: That takes a little bit of cooperation on the part of the owner, but I don't see why we couldn't do that if people asked for it.

365
00:32:30,407 --> 00:32:39,539
[SPEAKER_04]: But just know, you know, there, back in the day, we weren't doing that just because there was a cost associated with the legal ad that the commission is absorbing.

366
00:32:39,579 --> 00:32:42,242
[SPEAKER_04]: But now the owners are paying for that.

367
00:32:42,342 --> 00:32:45,687
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, we certainly accommodate it if they're paying for it.

368
00:32:46,762 --> 00:32:53,744
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and I think also just, I mean, we've had the opportunity because the, um, the form a and the form B were available.

369
00:32:54,064 --> 00:32:57,846
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, you know, I think in this instance, the board is going to make a determination.

370
00:32:57,866 --> 00:33:08,009
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to tell the board what they're going to do, but I've been at these hearings enough to know that, that this is likely something that the board is going to unanimously, unanimously, uh, move to the next stage.

371
00:33:08,049 --> 00:33:14,291
[SPEAKER_00]: And if that's the case, then in time, we're just, we're just, you know, wasting a month of time to get before the board.

372
00:33:14,691 --> 00:33:16,532
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're in July rather than in June.

373
00:33:17,235 --> 00:33:19,637
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, and it's a partial demolition.

374
00:33:19,677 --> 00:33:21,739
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so time is of the essence.

375
00:33:21,779 --> 00:33:33,208
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, you know, we went to the board of appeals originally, um, to obtain a use variance, did that first because there was no sense in discussing it if a use variance was not going to be permitted.

376
00:33:33,288 --> 00:33:38,192
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's also those time constraints to that would like to keep this moving along.

377
00:33:38,332 --> 00:33:44,057
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I would agree that given where the process for this house, the existence of the form and

378
00:33:44,784 --> 00:33:45,865
[SPEAKER_05]: the willingness of the owner.

379
00:33:46,105 --> 00:33:52,010
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I wouldn't make it a habit, but I think where we've got the consent of the owner, and again, as Ms.

380
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:56,894
[SPEAKER_05]: Desmond just pointed out, there's been a fair amount of process and other public forums about this building.

381
00:33:57,554 --> 00:33:59,036
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't see why we can't do it in this case.

382
00:34:03,239 --> 00:34:09,924
[SPEAKER_04]: So with that being said, I'm fine with that plan if the commissioners are, so I'll start by taking a motion to accept the application.

383
00:34:10,605 --> 00:34:12,847
[SPEAKER_05]: Move to accept the application as to form

384
00:34:13,655 --> 00:34:23,397
[SPEAKER_05]: and to schedule tentatively a public hearing subject to the usual requirements for the next meeting of the commission with the consent of the owner.

385
00:34:28,578 --> 00:34:31,198
[SPEAKER_06]: Consent of owner.

386
00:34:31,378 --> 00:34:31,858
[SPEAKER_04]: And a second?

387
00:34:36,259 --> 00:34:36,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Second.

388
00:34:36,899 --> 00:34:37,639
[SPEAKER_04]: Doug, thank you.

389
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,320
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, I'll go around as I see you, Doug.

390
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:41,460
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

391
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:42,860
[SPEAKER_04]: And Ed?

392
00:34:43,653 --> 00:35:01,963
[SPEAKER_04]: agreed yes handle any yes and peter yes okay four zero motion passes we'll get that legal add uh to you attorney desmond and um we'll get you on the agenda for next month for both the significance and the public hearing back to back

393
00:35:02,763 --> 00:35:08,546
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a point of, in terms of the public notice, is that going to Gatehouse Media?

394
00:35:08,666 --> 00:35:11,067
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that where we send it, or do we?

395
00:35:11,147 --> 00:35:12,348
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, it will.

396
00:35:13,248 --> 00:35:15,710
[SPEAKER_04]: Dennis will- Are we responsible for that, or, okay.

397
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:28,256
[SPEAKER_04]: So what we'll do is we'll tell you the dollar amount, we'll send you the dollar amount, and then Dennis will post it on your behalf once he receives the check from your client, you or the clients.

398
00:35:28,436 --> 00:35:30,137
[SPEAKER_04]: And then from there,

399
00:35:31,538 --> 00:35:37,341
[SPEAKER_04]: There's the signage requirement, which we should post just preemptively just because it should be up for the public hearing.

400
00:35:38,182 --> 00:35:39,182
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and that's it.

401
00:35:39,242 --> 00:35:39,502
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

402
00:35:39,923 --> 00:35:40,303
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

403
00:35:40,683 --> 00:35:41,624
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

404
00:35:43,284 --> 00:35:43,565
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

405
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:51,789
[SPEAKER_07]: Did I miss 3 to 5 pleasant street?

406
00:35:55,703 --> 00:35:57,505
[SPEAKER_04]: No, sorry, I totally missed it.

407
00:35:57,625 --> 00:36:03,151
[SPEAKER_04]: I skipped it because I went by for 85 Morton Street, so 3 to 5 Pleasant Street.

408
00:36:05,153 --> 00:36:05,614
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

409
00:36:08,388 --> 00:36:16,295
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, commissioners, we received an application for the demolition of the building at 3 to 5 Pleasant Street.

410
00:36:17,156 --> 00:36:22,701
[SPEAKER_04]: The building is a national register listed historic resource.

411
00:36:23,561 --> 00:36:26,284
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been fire damaged, but, um,

412
00:36:26,804 --> 00:36:32,448
[SPEAKER_04]: because the building is listed under the National Register of Historic Places.

413
00:36:32,848 --> 00:36:44,695
[SPEAKER_04]: If we accept the application to move forward, it will move right into a public hearing the following month after this, provided that we can meet all of the publication deadlines.

414
00:36:44,975 --> 00:36:52,360
[SPEAKER_04]: So I will accept a motion to accept the application, and we'll go from there.

415
00:36:53,993 --> 00:36:57,076
[SPEAKER_05]: move to accept the application as to form.

416
00:37:00,761 --> 00:37:01,221
[SPEAKER_03]: Second.

417
00:37:01,982 --> 00:37:03,343
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I'll give it to you, Eleni.

418
00:37:04,284 --> 00:37:08,329
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, Peter.

419
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:09,390
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm not.

420
00:37:12,623 --> 00:37:23,414
[SPEAKER_07]: I was talking to Chuck Veneziano, who was complaining about this project, and he was like, he can't believe that this house is going in.

421
00:37:23,854 --> 00:37:26,817
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just curious, because I didn't know what to tell him.

422
00:37:27,879 --> 00:37:34,705
[SPEAKER_07]: If the house is fire gutted, has it not been condemned by the building commissioner then?

423
00:37:35,525 --> 00:37:41,930
[SPEAKER_04]: So the commissioner is here, but I believe the answer to that question is no, not at this point.

424
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:48,915
[SPEAKER_04]: The commission, as you know, does not consider the state of the building, the structural aspect of the building.

425
00:37:48,955 --> 00:37:50,536
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the domain of the building department.

426
00:37:51,297 --> 00:37:57,762
[SPEAKER_04]: It's quite clear in our bylaw that he has the power to order the building down for public safety reasons.

427
00:37:57,882 --> 00:38:01,024
[SPEAKER_04]: But at this time, it's there.

428
00:38:01,825 --> 00:38:03,946
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the real question the commission

429
00:38:05,107 --> 00:38:30,402
[SPEAKER_04]: gets to ask itself is is the reuse of this building as it stands right now uh any sort of feasible thing or is it is its loss going to be detrimental to the overall understanding of the city of medford um you know there's minimal information that was a part of the national register form so i really think that all we're going to get out of it is information um but you know i

430
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:39,087
[SPEAKER_04]: personally look at this, just from my standpoint, that, you know, it's going to go to a hearing and then from there, is it preferably preserved?

431
00:38:39,507 --> 00:38:43,569
[SPEAKER_04]: And to me, the integrity of the building is gone because it's been fire gutted.

432
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:56,517
[SPEAKER_04]: So, we could accept the application, but if you choose not to and reject it on the grounds that it's a total loss because of fire, I would say that's an acceptable reason to reject the application.

433
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:07,528
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I was just curious how that works, just because, you know, it is a national register building or whatever, but we haven't really run into this situation.

434
00:39:07,588 --> 00:39:16,215
[SPEAKER_07]: So I was just, I know the commissioner has the power to condemn the building if it's needs to be condemned for safety reasons or whatever.

435
00:39:16,295 --> 00:39:22,100
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I was just assuming that that didn't happen and therefore we were looking at it.

436
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:23,901
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that correct?

437
00:39:25,302 --> 00:39:25,983
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, right.

438
00:39:26,003 --> 00:39:26,183
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

439
00:39:31,709 --> 00:39:36,213
[SPEAKER_04]: So do we want to, while there's a motion on the table, discuss potentially rejecting the application?

440
00:39:37,433 --> 00:39:41,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Or do we want to have the, does this building warrant a public hearing?

441
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:52,904
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess, and again, there has been talk about this particular problem.

442
00:39:52,984 --> 00:39:57,247
[SPEAKER_05]: The bylaw doesn't seem, the bylaw leaves a gap where

443
00:39:57,812 --> 00:40:06,356
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody agrees it's a total loss, but nobody, you know, but, you know, but essentially who's making the decision is a total loss.

444
00:40:06,436 --> 00:40:07,857
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it, you know, the insurance company?

445
00:40:08,617 --> 00:40:18,262
[SPEAKER_05]: Building commissioner will not, you know, won't, you know, would let it stay in its present state, even though there's, you know, which means you're basically wasting a lot.

446
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:25,446
[SPEAKER_05]: And as has been portrayed here on the record, you've got two, you've got two condo owners who would like to get a house back.

447
00:40:27,948 --> 00:40:40,210
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I think, you know, one more case for, after 10 years of experience trying to figure out, you know, some refinements, you know, refinements to the bylaw, because this is a situation we shouldn't be in.

448
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:47,551
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, you know, again, I'd rather the building commissioner say total loss demolished right now, but it seems like that's not gonna happen.

449
00:40:48,592 --> 00:40:50,492
[SPEAKER_05]: And the insurers are not gonna restore it.

450
00:40:51,192 --> 00:40:54,593
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the insurers are viewing the total loss from a structural point of view.

451
00:40:56,073 --> 00:40:57,353
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm not sure what, you know,

452
00:40:58,350 --> 00:41:06,978
[SPEAKER_05]: We're sort of caught in a situation which I think the bylaw didn't anticipate.

453
00:41:07,578 --> 00:41:08,679
[SPEAKER_05]: Fortunately, not very often.

454
00:41:10,001 --> 00:41:10,641
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, right.

455
00:41:10,701 --> 00:41:14,765
[SPEAKER_04]: And one would hope that we don't normally encounter this level of

456
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:18,601
[SPEAKER_04]: detrimental activity.

457
00:41:19,501 --> 00:41:26,624
[SPEAKER_04]: We encountered it with 82 Greenleaf, but in that instance, much more of the building was standing than this case.

458
00:41:27,784 --> 00:41:28,825
[SPEAKER_04]: Scott, I see your hand raised.

459
00:41:28,845 --> 00:41:29,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to chime in?

460
00:41:30,899 --> 00:41:33,761
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I just, I did want to offer a little bit of clarification.

461
00:41:34,881 --> 00:41:47,048
[SPEAKER_02]: From my understanding, speaking to the fire department, the inspector who was there that evening, the chimney has collapsed, the roof has collapsed, the second floor has collapsed, so substantially gone on the inside.

462
00:41:47,108 --> 00:41:50,010
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure if you've driven by it, you've seen the smoke and the char damage.

463
00:41:51,031 --> 00:41:52,632
[SPEAKER_02]: We did not immediately declare it.

464
00:41:53,432 --> 00:41:53,912
[SPEAKER_02]: condemned.

465
00:41:54,352 --> 00:41:56,293
[SPEAKER_02]: We did declare it do not enter.

466
00:41:56,473 --> 00:41:59,894
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what the big red X on it essentially means that was posted.

467
00:42:00,274 --> 00:42:01,895
[SPEAKER_02]: We wanted to respect the position.

468
00:42:01,935 --> 00:42:05,776
[SPEAKER_02]: We wanted to make it secure to the public at first and see where we stood with things.

469
00:42:06,876 --> 00:42:10,298
[SPEAKER_02]: The concern more for me as we go on is that is an attractive nuisance.

470
00:42:10,938 --> 00:42:16,160
[SPEAKER_02]: As the summer comes, people wander about and certainly being open to the weather, it continues to deteriorate.

471
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:17,120
[SPEAKER_02]: But

472
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:23,784
[SPEAKER_02]: But we do want to respect this process and get some feedback from you folks and sort of go from there.

473
00:42:23,864 --> 00:42:27,727
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's definitely very, very difficult to salvage any portion of it.

474
00:42:28,228 --> 00:42:32,250
[SPEAKER_02]: It also, I believe, has asbestos shingles on it and will take some work to remove that as well.

475
00:42:32,751 --> 00:42:34,072
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a bit of a mess.

476
00:42:34,752 --> 00:42:35,052
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

477
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:36,333
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

478
00:42:36,353 --> 00:42:36,554
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks.

479
00:42:43,639 --> 00:42:46,681
[SPEAKER_04]: Other comments from the commissioners, any other discussion on

480
00:42:51,172 --> 00:42:53,534
[SPEAKER_04]: Any discussion on which way you guys are leaning?

481
00:42:53,554 --> 00:43:05,702
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, my thought is to, since the house is, it's, you know, this far from being condemned, I can tell.

482
00:43:06,442 --> 00:43:14,207
[SPEAKER_07]: It's about a micron away from the edge of being condemned that I don't see any point in,

483
00:43:18,959 --> 00:43:34,605
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, lengthening this process or, you know, because I just feel that there's so much fabric there that is gone and, you know, so much damage.

484
00:43:36,086 --> 00:43:41,268
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, if there's some kind of documentation, that's the only thing I could think of, but maybe that could happen.

485
00:43:42,753 --> 00:43:45,215
[SPEAKER_07]: kind of at the same time, you know?

486
00:43:45,795 --> 00:43:47,756
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think I might be in favor.

487
00:43:47,836 --> 00:43:54,440
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I don't know if we can do this, but to kind of like just pass on it, let it, let it go.

488
00:43:55,201 --> 00:43:57,963
[SPEAKER_07]: But I mean, it is on the historic register, so I don't know.

489
00:43:58,903 --> 00:44:01,505
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I kind of agree with Peter on this.

490
00:44:01,745 --> 00:44:05,808
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, obviously we want to be very cautious in normal circumstances, but there's no house there.

491
00:44:05,828 --> 00:44:07,549
[SPEAKER_08]: There's never going to be another house there like that.

492
00:44:07,629 --> 00:44:08,750
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's not salvageable.

493
00:44:08,770 --> 00:44:12,412
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we would be perceived as slowing this down for no

494
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:14,121
[SPEAKER_08]: no logical reason.

495
00:44:14,201 --> 00:44:27,790
[SPEAKER_08]: I would assume cut our losses, maybe take some photos and documentation, but that's it and move forward as quickly as possible so that the neighborhood can get on the track to repairing itself and filling in that important piece.

496
00:44:31,372 --> 00:44:31,853
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree.

497
00:44:31,953 --> 00:44:37,336
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it does seem like it's mostly gone and there's not much left to preserve at this point.

498
00:44:37,356 --> 00:44:42,540
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be more of a reconstruction than preserving any kind of original

499
00:44:43,435 --> 00:44:44,396
[SPEAKER_03]: home.

500
00:44:44,516 --> 00:44:48,121
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, there is a way that we can just pass on it.

501
00:44:50,905 --> 00:44:52,707
[SPEAKER_03]: So you know, rebuilding can begin.

502
00:44:52,727 --> 00:44:54,710
[SPEAKER_03]: I would be in favor of that.

503
00:44:56,814 --> 00:45:08,218
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I might offer just a little bit more clarification, I know in talking to the owner, he does intend to rebuild on the same foundational footprint and rebuild essentially the same looking structure was there.

504
00:45:08,278 --> 00:45:11,980
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not his intention to come in with something new and modern.

505
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:15,481
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully what we see will be a better version of what was there.

506
00:45:19,583 --> 00:45:23,244
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it is.

507
00:45:23,344 --> 00:45:24,445
[SPEAKER_08]: It is good to hear.

508
00:45:24,485 --> 00:45:25,045
[SPEAKER_08]: And if the owner.

509
00:45:26,149 --> 00:45:30,292
[SPEAKER_08]: is, you know, there's obviously some architects in this board have a lot of experience.

510
00:45:30,352 --> 00:45:34,774
[SPEAKER_08]: They can, he's looking for some free advice to help get them there.

511
00:45:34,794 --> 00:45:40,778
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we have, I don't know if existing drawings are available.

512
00:45:41,318 --> 00:45:44,080
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously old photos might be something that would assist as well.

513
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:46,241
[SPEAKER_08]: So there could be some resources that we could help with.

514
00:45:50,864 --> 00:45:52,185
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, commissioners,

515
00:45:55,673 --> 00:45:58,714
[SPEAKER_04]: The motion has been made to accept the application.

516
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:03,977
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you, if we accept the application, it moves right into the hearing.

517
00:46:03,997 --> 00:46:09,439
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you turn it down, and we just reject it, then it will, will move forward, and there'll be no further review.

518
00:46:12,701 --> 00:46:17,923
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll call it as I see you on the table starting with Ed.

519
00:46:19,364 --> 00:46:24,786
[SPEAKER_05]: With the based on the discussion from the chair from the vice chair, no, reject.

520
00:46:25,678 --> 00:46:26,598
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, and Doug?

521
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:27,939
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

522
00:46:28,579 --> 00:46:29,020
[SPEAKER_04]: And Peter?

523
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:43,807
[SPEAKER_07]: No, but I wonder if we should, sorry, I wonder if we should amend the motion to say, to reject the application for the purposes of passing on review.

524
00:46:47,689 --> 00:46:47,989
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

525
00:46:48,950 --> 00:46:50,791
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

526
00:46:50,851 --> 00:46:54,332
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's finish this vote and then we'll amend the vote afterwards.

527
00:46:54,352 --> 00:46:54,573
[SPEAKER_04]: Eleni?

528
00:46:56,110 --> 00:46:56,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Now.

529
00:46:57,071 --> 00:47:01,073
[SPEAKER_04]: So for 0 rejected Peter do you want to amend the vote.

530
00:47:02,493 --> 00:47:14,960
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I'd like to amend the motion to be to reject the demolition application for the purposes of passing on review.

531
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:16,241
[SPEAKER_07]: Further review.

532
00:47:20,983 --> 00:47:21,404
[SPEAKER_04]: And second.

533
00:47:26,274 --> 00:47:28,317
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll do it as I call it Peter.

534
00:47:30,058 --> 00:47:31,079
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, Doug.

535
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:34,383
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Ed.

536
00:47:35,344 --> 00:47:35,544
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

537
00:47:36,105 --> 00:47:36,505
[SPEAKER_04]: And Lenny.

538
00:47:36,525 --> 00:47:37,326
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

539
00:47:37,706 --> 00:47:38,908
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, the motions amended.

540
00:47:41,771 --> 00:47:42,131
[SPEAKER_04]: All set.

541
00:47:42,812 --> 00:47:48,478
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so I will get the letter out for this property and they will be all set and on their way.

542
00:47:50,283 --> 00:47:52,004
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Peter, for calling my attention to that.

543
00:47:52,125 --> 00:47:52,885
[SPEAKER_04]: I almost missed them.

544
00:47:52,905 --> 00:47:55,307
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, site plan review.

545
00:47:55,347 --> 00:47:56,888
[SPEAKER_04]: 400 Mystic Ave.

546
00:47:56,928 --> 00:48:02,113
[SPEAKER_04]: Commissioners, I sent out the information that I received for 400 Mystic Ave.

547
00:48:02,133 --> 00:48:04,975
[SPEAKER_04]: Did anybody have a chance to take a look at it?

548
00:48:05,976 --> 00:48:07,317
[SPEAKER_05]: I looked at the drawings.

549
00:48:07,337 --> 00:48:17,125
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, this would be the great showpiece of Mystic Ave's automobile alley, which seems to be something which you're losing, not gaining.

550
00:48:19,998 --> 00:48:21,798
[SPEAKER_05]: Other than I don't think we have a lot to say about it.

551
00:48:25,899 --> 00:48:29,140
[SPEAKER_04]: So, we can maybe reach out to them and just say no comment this time.

552
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:32,000
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's the right approach.

553
00:48:32,621 --> 00:48:34,801
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I agree because it seems like.

554
00:48:37,341 --> 00:48:40,642
[SPEAKER_07]: Most of the building is sort of staying there and it's also kind of like.

555
00:48:40,662 --> 00:48:44,323
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know when the building was built, but.

556
00:48:46,334 --> 00:48:50,477
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what relevance we could have on it because they're adding a little bit more.

557
00:48:50,517 --> 00:48:53,960
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like office space or whatever back.

558
00:48:54,020 --> 00:49:00,685
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, some kind of space, but the bank building is still sort of pretty much intact.

559
00:49:00,765 --> 00:49:03,887
[SPEAKER_07]: It's now have a big Toyota sign on it.

560
00:49:04,347 --> 00:49:08,010
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's going to have a Toyota sign and it looks like they're going to put cars.

561
00:49:08,110 --> 00:49:11,973
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like a five-story showroom, at least as seen from Route 93.

562
00:49:15,407 --> 00:49:23,919
[SPEAKER_05]: But the I'm saying it in a way they're preserving on will be allowing for 30 years ago, but that's not our jurisdiction ordinarily.

563
00:49:29,197 --> 00:49:29,597
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, great.

564
00:49:29,818 --> 00:49:32,500
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll let them know that we don't really have any comment at this time.

565
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:42,907
[SPEAKER_04]: 280 Misticab, I sent out, or I received the wrong link for it, received the link for the previously submitted information.

566
00:49:43,588 --> 00:49:52,094
[SPEAKER_04]: So Dennis is going to send us out the revised packet to make sure that we have the most up-to-date information for that project.

567
00:49:53,415 --> 00:49:55,576
[SPEAKER_04]: So commissioners, our comments will be due relatively soon.

568
00:49:55,677 --> 00:50:03,141
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll make sure that we get those comments off and handle that, send it off to community development.

569
00:50:03,901 --> 00:50:14,728
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, apart from your urban planning piece, the only building which was referred to as 280, which I gather is a Bank of America, had been the Bank of America building.

570
00:50:16,369 --> 00:50:22,052
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, that's way post 45, I mean, just from the look of it.

571
00:50:22,514 --> 00:50:27,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, all the all the buildings on that side of the street are all really post-war.

572
00:50:27,236 --> 00:50:35,878
[SPEAKER_04]: There are early industrial buildings on the other side of the street and further up towards Medford Square and way down towards Somerville.

573
00:50:35,898 --> 00:50:39,359
[SPEAKER_04]: But those are really just utilitarian brick buildings.

574
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:47,562
[SPEAKER_04]: There are some older, older businesses like Duff Spring is a business that's been there pretty close to 100 years now.

575
00:50:47,682 --> 00:50:49,703
[SPEAKER_04]: And the little

576
00:50:50,783 --> 00:50:59,449
[SPEAKER_04]: building, which is the inspectional, auto inspection place, says originally started life as a service station way down on the Somerville line.

577
00:50:59,569 --> 00:51:04,492
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know, they're, they're not really anything impressive.

578
00:51:04,792 --> 00:51:11,116
[SPEAKER_04]: What makes it kind of interesting is it's one of the few places that industry has kind of congregated outside of the railroad.

579
00:51:11,556 --> 00:51:17,220
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, probably because it was just open swampland throughout most of the 20th century.

580
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:17,280
[SPEAKER_04]: So

581
00:51:20,395 --> 00:51:23,958
[SPEAKER_04]: By and large, most of those buildings are probably not going to come before us for any sort of review.

582
00:51:27,181 --> 00:51:28,803
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other questions on that?

583
00:51:28,823 --> 00:51:31,826
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, hearing none, I'll send it out.

584
00:51:32,326 --> 00:51:36,490
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll get final comments off before so that we can address that.

585
00:51:37,491 --> 00:51:39,753
[SPEAKER_08]: Brian, can I ask a question?

586
00:51:41,074 --> 00:51:42,416
[SPEAKER_08]: We've seen this before, haven't we?

587
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:51,720
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I was checking the emails and I think it came before us for a slightly different review.

588
00:51:52,541 --> 00:52:01,632
[SPEAKER_04]: It may have incorporated some other projects in addition to residential, but I think the latest is that this is a totally residential project now.

589
00:52:02,052 --> 00:52:07,620
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course with 40B, the big thing is that they're receiving a comprehensive permit.

590
00:52:07,701 --> 00:52:11,086
[SPEAKER_04]: So that includes demolition delay all at once.

591
00:52:11,146 --> 00:52:16,814
[SPEAKER_04]: So if they receive their comprehensive permit, this is our opportunity to get in with those comments now.

592
00:52:18,888 --> 00:52:21,810
[SPEAKER_08]: This was a lab project a couple of years ago, right?

593
00:52:21,830 --> 00:52:23,632
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what it was two or three buildings.

594
00:52:24,493 --> 00:52:27,175
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think there was like a biotech labs.

595
00:52:27,375 --> 00:52:28,416
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, opposite hurts.

596
00:52:28,496 --> 00:52:31,158
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there was like a five story proposed building there.

597
00:52:31,178 --> 00:52:33,720
[SPEAKER_04]: That was way too big for this proposed tiny site.

598
00:52:34,761 --> 00:52:36,162
[SPEAKER_04]: Scott, do you have clarification?

599
00:52:36,502 --> 00:52:37,883
[SPEAKER_02]: I can give you a little bit of clarification.

600
00:52:37,903 --> 00:52:39,644
[SPEAKER_02]: There's one building that's missing from there.

601
00:52:39,704 --> 00:52:42,145
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the old staples that was torn down a few years ago.

602
00:52:42,165 --> 00:52:43,966
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, that is the other half of it.

603
00:52:44,126 --> 00:52:51,490
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, prior to the pandemic they had come in with lab buildings due to the pandemic and a lawsuit over some other issues.

604
00:52:51,530 --> 00:53:04,396
[SPEAKER_02]: They went into sort of a tolling hold and are now coming back and they are sticking strictly with 300 plus units under a 40 B. So yeah, you have seen it in various guises, parts and pieces in the past, and that's why it's familiar.

605
00:53:07,083 --> 00:53:11,047
[SPEAKER_08]: Why is it called Medford Science Park if it's residential now?

606
00:53:11,148 --> 00:53:13,250
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's the wrong link.

607
00:53:13,530 --> 00:53:14,591
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's the wrong link.

608
00:53:14,651 --> 00:53:16,193
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we got sent the wrong link from 2023.

609
00:53:16,353 --> 00:53:17,935
[SPEAKER_04]: Gotcha.

610
00:53:18,095 --> 00:53:18,376
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

611
00:53:18,856 --> 00:53:20,178
[SPEAKER_08]: That explains a lot.

612
00:53:20,658 --> 00:53:20,818
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

613
00:53:21,259 --> 00:53:25,463
[SPEAKER_04]: So Dennis said he promised to get it out to us first thing in the morning.

614
00:53:25,544 --> 00:53:28,227
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll send that out as soon as I receive it.

615
00:53:31,187 --> 00:53:31,567
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, great.

616
00:53:32,769 --> 00:53:50,206
[SPEAKER_04]: Properties under demo delay at this point I haven't heard anything for 91 Winchester Street and of course as we know we gave 56 Wareham Street their marching orders to come up with a design for the reuse of that building so we'll just wait and see if we, when we hear something back on those we'll give it before the board.

617
00:53:51,587 --> 00:53:56,548
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have anything for comments on permit subcommittee at this point.

618
00:53:58,609 --> 00:54:15,013
[SPEAKER_04]: For Cross Street Cemetery, for the general updates for the projects that I'm working on there, it's a little bit frustrating because I'm trying to get the projects underway, but I'm waiting for a grant account to be set up so that I can expend

619
00:54:15,833 --> 00:54:34,572
[SPEAKER_04]: uh money um on behalf of the grant and there's only two people in the city that do that and it's been a relatively painful process so i've just been sitting around waiting for nearly two months so i'm going to try to poke the bear tomorrow and get them to really try to push it because i'd like to get it some of it done before the end of the fiscal year so

620
00:54:36,013 --> 00:54:38,014
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be great if it didn't straddle the fiscal year.

621
00:54:38,054 --> 00:54:40,295
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus we're coming up on CPC deadlines.

622
00:54:40,395 --> 00:54:43,516
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, they're only holding themselves up.

623
00:54:43,756 --> 00:54:55,981
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we need to have project information, you know, in order to, you know, we need the funding so that we can get the consultants to get project information so I can apply for CPC funding to move forward with that portion of it.

624
00:54:56,121 --> 00:54:56,821
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, so.

625
00:54:56,901 --> 00:55:01,483
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this for the headstones or for the internment thing?

626
00:55:01,983 --> 00:55:07,365
[SPEAKER_04]: Just for the just for the headstone restoration portion of the project.

627
00:55:07,985 --> 00:55:17,048
[SPEAKER_04]: The cemetery archaeological investigation at the former cross street cemetery site is also in a bit of a holding pattern because I'm, I have to go out and get.

628
00:55:18,488 --> 00:55:24,555
[SPEAKER_04]: estimates for consultants for public procurement process and it's been a little bit of a beast.

629
00:55:24,955 --> 00:55:32,944
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm just trying to get that off the ground and as soon as I have those quotes then we can move forward with a consultant but I have to go out and get the quotes first.

630
00:55:34,406 --> 00:55:37,449
[SPEAKER_04]: So that also is moving forward but slowly.

631
00:55:40,045 --> 00:56:06,175
[SPEAKER_04]: for cpa projects for thomas brooks park we got the funding from city council so city council has um approved the funding so now i just will work with teresa to get the final paperwork signed off and we can begin the process of moving forward with that project um that i think the other projects um take precedent over that one for now just because uh i've been working to get them on

632
00:56:06,915 --> 00:56:32,456
[SPEAKER_04]: on board and underway so my focus will be to get cross street underway before i take on anything with the cpc portion of the project but with a little bit of luck you know i should be able to start you know plan specs and bidding for that project maybe in the mid-summer ish time period assuming that the other consultants are all underway i would love

633
00:56:33,597 --> 00:56:34,317
[SPEAKER_04]: volunteer help.

634
00:56:35,037 --> 00:56:44,240
[SPEAKER_04]: So and Jen and Kit are not here tonight so automatically they get put on my committee and you know they don't get any say in the matter.

635
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:49,202
[SPEAKER_04]: But if anybody else wants to help I will gladly spread some of this workload around.

636
00:56:49,222 --> 00:56:55,464
[SPEAKER_04]: The biggest turtles are just getting numbers and dealing with the consultants and procurement issues to start.

637
00:56:55,624 --> 00:56:58,805
[SPEAKER_04]: Once that's underway the consultants just kind of do their own thing.

638
00:57:03,678 --> 00:57:11,805
[SPEAKER_04]: For survey and planning projects, the consultants delivered the second half of inventory forms for our review and comment.

639
00:57:12,485 --> 00:57:13,786
[SPEAKER_04]: I did have a chance to review them.

640
00:57:13,806 --> 00:57:16,689
[SPEAKER_04]: They're chock full of great information on Fulton Heights.

641
00:57:17,629 --> 00:57:27,758
[SPEAKER_04]: So the only thing left to do is we're waiting for Massachusetts Historical Commission to provide feedback and then they can wrap up that project, hopefully by the end of the fiscal year is what we're shooting for.

642
00:57:28,619 --> 00:57:30,740
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll be back on track and then we can start

643
00:57:31,730 --> 00:57:38,458
[SPEAKER_04]: a new project in the new fiscal year when we're ready, working on one of the existing neighborhoods that we decided we would go back to.

644
00:57:38,478 --> 00:57:43,784
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're going to ask MHC for some additional money.

645
00:57:43,904 --> 00:57:50,372
[SPEAKER_04]: Usually they have money to pass down to CLGs, so it's a little bit of an off year for us because we

646
00:57:51,693 --> 00:57:57,537
[SPEAKER_04]: are working with them kind of in a close partnership, but without the normal S&P grant that we receive.

647
00:57:57,657 --> 00:58:04,661
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have flexibility if we don't receive anything from them, but we'll be moving forward with some project there.

648
00:58:07,123 --> 00:58:09,784
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's all that I have on those items.

649
00:58:09,884 --> 00:58:17,009
[SPEAKER_04]: The only thing left on the agenda is the approval of minutes, but before I do that, is there any other old business, new business that you wanted to bring up?

650
00:58:19,484 --> 00:58:22,846
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, hearing none, we'll take Peter's meeting minutes.

651
00:58:23,506 --> 00:58:24,607
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody have a chance to review?

652
00:58:24,627 --> 00:58:28,289
[SPEAKER_05]: Move to accept.

653
00:58:30,991 --> 00:58:31,451
[SPEAKER_04]: And a second?

654
00:58:32,612 --> 00:58:33,132
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll second.

655
00:58:36,754 --> 00:58:39,255
[SPEAKER_04]: Second, OK.
