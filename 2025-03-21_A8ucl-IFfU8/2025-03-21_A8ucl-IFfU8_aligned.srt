1
00:00:01,021 --> 00:00:04,783
The 31st regular meeting of the Medford City Council will be called to order.

2
00:00:04,943 --> 00:00:05,904
The clerk will call the roll.

3
00:00:07,765 --> 00:00:08,946
Vice President Caviello?

4
00:00:09,126 --> 00:00:09,286
Yes.

5
00:00:10,267 --> 00:00:11,007
Councilor DelaRusso?

6
00:00:11,027 --> 00:00:11,167
Present.

7
00:00:12,148 --> 00:00:12,748
Councilor Knight?

8
00:00:13,809 --> 00:00:13,949
Present.

9
00:00:13,969 --> 00:00:14,469
Councilor McKern?

10
00:00:14,489 --> 00:00:14,649
Present.

11
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:16,190
Councilor Mox?

12
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:17,391
Present.

13
00:00:18,111 --> 00:00:18,592
Councilor Penta?

14
00:00:18,612 --> 00:00:18,772
Present.

15
00:00:19,692 --> 00:00:20,393
President Camuso?

16
00:00:20,953 --> 00:00:21,293
Present.

17
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:23,615
Seven members present, zero in the absence.

18
00:00:23,775 --> 00:00:25,556
Please stand to salute our flag.

19
00:00:38,967 --> 00:00:48,678
Item 14-712, petition by Emily Stein, 177 High Street, Medford, Mass., to address the council about distracted driving.

20
00:00:52,063 --> 00:00:53,904
Your name and address for the record, please.

21
00:00:54,144 --> 00:00:56,604
Emily Stein, 177 High Street.

22
00:00:57,164 --> 00:00:58,605
Thank you.

23
00:00:58,685 --> 00:01:10,508
So I'm here as a resident of Medford, as a parent, as a nurse, as a road safety advocate, and as a victim to just address the issue of distracted driving.

24
00:01:11,248 --> 00:01:15,809
It's not just simply texting, using your phone, but it's everything.

25
00:01:15,829 --> 00:01:17,590
I feel it's an epidemic across the country.

26
00:01:18,023 --> 00:01:26,555
It goes across every age group, every race, every other demographic and region, whether it's in the city driving or out in the country.

27
00:01:28,577 --> 00:01:31,441
I have been involved in this work for the last two years.

28
00:01:32,062 --> 00:01:35,687
I know Mayor McGlynn is active in supporting what we've been doing.

29
00:01:36,556 --> 00:01:42,499
For the last two years, we've gone to Medford High School to give a presentation on distracted driving for the high schoolers.

30
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:48,061
But I view this as more of a societal problem.

31
00:01:48,121 --> 00:01:49,842
It's not just teenagers.

32
00:01:49,902 --> 00:01:51,403
Everyone says, oh, it's a teenage problem.

33
00:01:51,423 --> 00:01:52,323
They're always on the phone.

34
00:01:53,724 --> 00:01:54,664
It's every age.

35
00:01:56,645 --> 00:01:59,967
And what I'm trying to do is say, let's start with Medford.

36
00:02:00,047 --> 00:02:04,729
Let's have this be a community where we not only have gone to the high schools for several years,

37
00:02:05,925 --> 00:02:27,551
you know, on board, but to have a community-wide commitment to say, let's stop distracted driving in our community, whether we're putting up signs, whether we're having, you know, more local businesses, community members aware of it and supporting it just to build the visibility.

38
00:02:27,751 --> 00:02:33,233
I think so many people aren't aware that just talking on their phone, they could actually cause a fatal crash.

39
00:02:34,987 --> 00:02:37,248
It's something that the public needs to know a lot about.

40
00:02:37,488 --> 00:02:39,950
I've been doing this for two years because my father was killed.

41
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:41,811
And this is why I'm here.

42
00:02:42,211 --> 00:02:43,212
And I've been doing this work.

43
00:02:43,292 --> 00:02:44,492
This is what I'm dedicated to.

44
00:02:45,453 --> 00:02:47,734
And everyone says, oh, start with your family, start with your friends.

45
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:55,798
And this is why I'm here, because I thought, let's have Medford be a place that could be a stand-up community to say, we're against this.

46
00:02:57,739 --> 00:02:59,861
I'm getting the law enforcement involved.

47
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:04,043
I'm going to try to go to some police meetings and see what they can do.

48
00:03:05,372 --> 00:03:08,953
I mean, if you stand out in front of my house during rush hour traffic, everyone is on their phone.

49
00:03:09,133 --> 00:03:10,113
Everyone is looking down.

50
00:03:11,254 --> 00:03:12,574
And it scares me to be on the road.

51
00:03:12,614 --> 00:03:17,996
It scares me to walk down the street because I've seen a lot of bad driving and most often it's due to destruction.

52
00:03:20,556 --> 00:03:21,797
So I'm just putting it out here.

53
00:03:21,837 --> 00:03:22,917
This is my first time here.

54
00:03:22,977 --> 00:03:26,318
I just wanted to say what people think.

55
00:03:28,279 --> 00:03:32,920
I'm trying to pair up with a Gannis driving school now that they're located in the square.

56
00:03:33,835 --> 00:03:40,079
And I was talking with the owner to say, let's have a free evening session with adults.

57
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,641
Anyone in the community can come.

58
00:03:43,101 --> 00:03:44,762
They can bring their child, even better.

59
00:03:45,403 --> 00:03:53,148
So that way, the family, it can be like a family agreement to say, we're going to sign a ban against phone use in the car.

60
00:03:53,388 --> 00:03:55,409
We're going to agree to do this together.

61
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:57,511
So that's one thing we're doing.

62
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:02,334
And then on January 7, we will be presenting at the high school.

63
00:04:03,523 --> 00:04:09,604
Mayor McGlynn, I know he's tried several times to be there in the past year, the past two years, so hopefully he will be there.

64
00:04:10,684 --> 00:04:11,785
But that will be the high school.

65
00:04:12,665 --> 00:04:26,747
I'm teamed up with the Mass Academy of Trial Attorneys, and they have been working with the mayor, and they're taking this to as many high schools across the state as they can to give a presentation that's been designed to educate on distracted driving.

66
00:04:27,707 --> 00:04:30,368
So that's pretty much it.

67
00:04:32,905 --> 00:04:34,986
I am new to Medford.

68
00:04:35,006 --> 00:04:36,087
I've been here for about a year and a half.

69
00:04:37,167 --> 00:04:41,149
But I feel like this, it is a community that could take this on.

70
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:42,630
So that's.

71
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:44,831
Thank you very much, Emily.

72
00:04:44,911 --> 00:04:46,911
The chair recognizes Councilor Lungo-Kern.

73
00:04:48,092 --> 00:04:49,533
Thank you, President Camuso.

74
00:04:49,813 --> 00:04:50,973
Thank you, Emily, for coming.

75
00:04:52,274 --> 00:04:59,057
Do you work for a specific organization or you do this on the side as like, just to raise awareness, volunteerism?

76
00:04:59,484 --> 00:05:01,105
I mean, it's unpaid work right now.

77
00:05:02,066 --> 00:05:04,567
I am partnered with NDD.org.

78
00:05:05,688 --> 00:05:09,790
It's an organization that was founded by a father who lost his daughter due to a distracted driver.

79
00:05:10,251 --> 00:05:11,591
And he's taking this nationally.

80
00:05:11,612 --> 00:05:15,694
So he's been giving presentations for the last three years across the entire country.

81
00:05:16,334 --> 00:05:20,997
And he's training lawyers.

82
00:05:21,117 --> 00:05:22,058
He was a lawyer himself.

83
00:05:22,078 --> 00:05:26,461
So he's training lawyers to give this presentation to as many schools as they can.

84
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:32,694
I know in Massachusetts it's been about 7,000 presentations that have been given to high schools.

85
00:05:33,694 --> 00:05:36,036
Is there anything in the middle school or grade schools?

86
00:05:36,977 --> 00:05:37,057
No.

87
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:43,281
And I have my three-year-old trained to say, you better put that phone down, or she looks at other cars and notices it.

88
00:05:43,822 --> 00:05:51,907
So I believe that the younger you go, they have the power to change their parents' behavior as well as just, you know, they grow up with that awareness.

89
00:05:52,328 --> 00:05:56,771
Yeah, I mean, just having two small children that are, you know, walking age,

90
00:05:57,345 --> 00:06:02,607
When we walk to school, even just from parking and walking to school, there's distracted drivers everywhere.

91
00:06:02,667 --> 00:06:07,970
So something in the grade schools would be great just to teach children to look both ways when they cross the street.

92
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:15,393
They'll think they're OK because they're running on the sidewalk, but they're not because people are backing out of their driveways without looking.

93
00:06:15,553 --> 00:06:22,656
So I applaud you for your volunteerism and feel awful for what you've been through.

94
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:24,597
But I think what you're doing for the community is great.

95
00:06:25,847 --> 00:06:28,909
do some personal injury work, and it's a horror story.

96
00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:30,049
It's very scary.

97
00:06:30,149 --> 00:06:35,392
I drive on 10 and 2 because I just read about what goes on and the accidents that take place.

98
00:06:35,993 --> 00:06:38,594
So we take it very seriously, I'm sure, as a council.

99
00:06:38,634 --> 00:06:44,137
And anything I personally or the council can do to help you, we're on board, absolutely.

100
00:06:44,277 --> 00:06:45,018
OK, great.

101
00:06:45,118 --> 00:06:45,698
Thanks very much.

102
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:52,081
The chair recognizes Councilor Pettis.

103
00:06:52,582 --> 00:06:52,742
Ms.

104
00:06:52,762 --> 00:06:52,962
Stein?

105
00:07:00,552 --> 00:07:04,033
You represent the unfortunate part of what happens in society.

106
00:07:05,193 --> 00:07:07,854
Some people don't get involved until it happens to them.

107
00:07:07,874 --> 00:07:09,674
And unfortunately, it's with you and your dad.

108
00:07:10,394 --> 00:07:12,935
But this is a huge issue.

109
00:07:12,995 --> 00:07:14,195
And I'm glad you brought it up.

110
00:07:14,235 --> 00:07:16,215
And I agree with Councilor Lungo-Curran.

111
00:07:16,935 --> 00:07:23,137
These kids go to school, and they're not worried about who's pulling out of a driveway or who might be coming down the street at a record speed.

112
00:07:23,477 --> 00:07:28,718
But if you thought of going to the State Department of Public Safety, and they have a belief

113
00:07:31,292 --> 00:07:32,332
It's kiddie grants.

114
00:07:32,692 --> 00:07:34,953
I could be wrong with the name, but I think it's something like that.

115
00:07:36,033 --> 00:07:46,936
And they promote, through financial aid, having somebody maybe even come up to the school and go through sample demonstrations as what to look out for.

116
00:07:47,256 --> 00:07:54,958
You know, you can talk to the kid or the children, but if you demonstrate it right in front of them, you know, it's live and it's real.

117
00:07:55,538 --> 00:08:00,419
And, you know, and I think that could possibly, you know, it's just another avenue to get more exposure, but at the same time,

118
00:08:01,037 --> 00:08:08,139
increase the liability that you don't really want to have anyone else go through such as yourself, unfortunately.

119
00:08:08,659 --> 00:08:13,080
But it did happen, and I'm glad you're doing what you're doing, and you should be complimented.

120
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:18,161
But to keep this thing going, and keep it alive, and making a presentation.

121
00:08:18,181 --> 00:08:22,142
I would suggest that you go before the school committee too, and make the same suggestion to them.

122
00:08:22,162 --> 00:08:26,603
because they have the onus responsibility of making sure those kids get to school correctly.

123
00:08:27,967 --> 00:08:29,469
starting with the elementary school.

124
00:08:29,549 --> 00:08:36,213
And this is one of their obligations and their way of representing you, the taxpayers and the children of this community.

125
00:08:36,694 --> 00:08:42,918
So I think you have two viable options to go to, to make your case here and at the same time get some more help.

126
00:08:43,199 --> 00:08:44,439
So the Department of Public Safety?

127
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,101
The State Department of Public Safety.

128
00:08:47,702 --> 00:08:47,962
Thank you.

129
00:08:48,182 --> 00:08:48,723
You're welcome.

130
00:08:48,743 --> 00:08:54,767
And also if you would reach out to the superintendent of schools, he has a public educational access channel.

131
00:08:55,211 --> 00:08:58,132
I'm sure he'd be more than happy to get your message out there.

132
00:08:58,272 --> 00:08:58,872
That's a great point.

133
00:08:58,912 --> 00:08:59,552
I've met with him.

134
00:08:59,572 --> 00:08:59,932
He's great.

135
00:09:00,492 --> 00:09:05,214
So, uh, he's very, um, very amenable to doing that on important, uh, issues.

136
00:09:05,954 --> 00:09:08,455
The chair recognizes vice president Cara Viello.

137
00:09:08,595 --> 00:09:09,355
Thank you, Mr. President.

138
00:09:09,975 --> 00:09:12,256
Uh, Emily, again, I want to commend you for coming up to it.

139
00:09:12,756 --> 00:09:17,177
Um, as someone who drives all day, uh, I think I see it more than anybody.

140
00:09:17,197 --> 00:09:24,459
I mean, people would just, I mean, it isn't so much, you know, the talking and people have Bluetooth sound, they're talking to Bluetooth, but the texting is,

141
00:09:25,107 --> 00:09:26,008
I mean, it's just ridiculous.

142
00:09:27,488 --> 00:09:28,869
And I see it constantly.

143
00:09:29,229 --> 00:09:30,930
People just texting, driving around.

144
00:09:32,711 --> 00:09:34,772
You know, people talk about distracted driving.

145
00:09:35,693 --> 00:09:37,514
We should be talking about distracted walking.

146
00:09:37,954 --> 00:09:38,755
Yes, I agree.

147
00:09:38,775 --> 00:09:40,235
Which is just as bad as you see.

148
00:09:40,536 --> 00:09:51,482
When you're downtown, people are just obsessed with their phones and they're walking on the streets and don't even, I mean, it's bad enough people aren't paying attention to the cars, but now you're not even paying attention, walking out into the streets of the cities.

149
00:09:51,502 --> 00:09:53,383
And again, I commend you for your work.

150
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:57,115
I think the next thing should be distracted walking.

151
00:09:57,735 --> 00:10:05,419
I know London has put up cushions, like football cushions around lampposts because so many people have injured themselves walking into them.

152
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:10,061
You see the people with the headphones and they're just walking, just not paying attention or anything.

153
00:10:10,081 --> 00:10:13,823
That's something that we are taking on as pedestrian safety as well because I think so many

154
00:10:14,786 --> 00:10:17,787
so many incidents are happening because everyone's looking down.

155
00:10:17,928 --> 00:10:21,449
And then no one knows they call it an accident because no one's at fault because they were looking down.

156
00:10:21,469 --> 00:10:22,250
They don't even know.

157
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:30,594
So what I do is when I went to speak at a medical center and I said, everyone, I'm challenging you for the next week, put your phones away, watch where you're going.

158
00:10:30,634 --> 00:10:31,974
It doesn't look at everyone out there.

159
00:10:32,034 --> 00:10:32,655
We're obsessed.

160
00:10:32,695 --> 00:10:38,577
We're obsessed with our phones and people have to understand we're not that important that we need to be in touch with everybody 24 hours a day.

161
00:10:38,837 --> 00:10:39,018
Right.

162
00:10:39,578 --> 00:10:39,918
Thank you.

163
00:10:40,198 --> 00:10:40,478
Thank you.

164
00:10:42,379 --> 00:10:44,160
The chair recognizes council night.

165
00:10:44,946 --> 00:10:46,727
Mr. President, thank you very much, and Ms.

166
00:10:46,747 --> 00:10:49,689
Stein, thank you very much for coming down and welcome to the city.

167
00:10:49,929 --> 00:10:53,491
We're glad to see that you're willing to be an active participant in the government.

168
00:10:54,912 --> 00:11:11,722
I think this is a worthwhile endeavor, Mr. President, and I think that it might make sense for this council to send the paper to the Traffic and Parking Commission for them to maybe conduct an investigation and report back to this council what their findings are and what steps they feel is appropriate for us to take as a community to ensure that we actually address the issue.

169
00:11:13,299 --> 00:11:17,682
On the motion of Councilor Knight to send this to the Traffic Commission, the Chair recognizes Councilor Marks.

170
00:11:19,103 --> 00:11:20,003
Thank you, Mr. President.

171
00:11:21,044 --> 00:11:30,349
Is there any current legislation that you're tracking now or something that maybe we as a Council can review to get on board to support?

172
00:11:30,549 --> 00:11:31,010
Absolutely.

173
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:35,893
Massachusetts, I think, since 2007 has been a texting—you know, there's a texting ban.

174
00:11:36,433 --> 00:11:38,074
They keep shutting down the hands-free ban.

175
00:11:40,181 --> 00:11:41,762
I know AAA is behind it.

176
00:11:41,782 --> 00:11:43,724
There are a lot of agencies who are behind it.

177
00:11:44,365 --> 00:11:49,369
But again, it does come down to the local, the reps.

178
00:11:49,989 --> 00:11:52,271
I think it was the Senate passed, but the reps didn't.

179
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:53,953
I forget where it was held up.

180
00:11:54,873 --> 00:11:56,174
So yes, absolutely.

181
00:11:56,235 --> 00:11:57,896
I mean, again, that's a step.

182
00:11:58,476 --> 00:12:02,480
Like I know in Canada, they have complete ban on all phone use.

183
00:12:03,063 --> 00:12:05,144
But we're a little behind.

184
00:12:05,405 --> 00:12:11,189
So a hands-free ban would be a huge help for law enforcement to at least catch people.

185
00:12:11,249 --> 00:12:15,451
Because right now, if they see someone texting, they might pull them over and they say, oh, I was just dialing a number.

186
00:12:15,852 --> 00:12:18,634
So it's hard for the law enforcement to catch people.

187
00:12:19,814 --> 00:12:30,642
So if there is a hands-free ban that passes in Massachusetts, that's one step, a big step, towards putting a stop to a lot of the incidents out there.

188
00:12:32,558 --> 00:12:34,799
As far as who to influence, I don't know.

189
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,861
I can do some legwork and get back.

190
00:12:39,602 --> 00:12:40,882
I know AAA is really behind it.

191
00:12:40,902 --> 00:12:48,186
Mary McGuire at AAA has been trying to track all the politicians who need to be more educated on this issue.

192
00:12:49,967 --> 00:12:50,767
But that's one step.

193
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:54,609
Mr. President, just a thought.

194
00:12:55,369 --> 00:13:00,512
I wonder if we, as a community, can enact our own hands-free ban.

195
00:13:01,899 --> 00:13:04,360
or does that have to be done on the state level?

196
00:13:05,341 --> 00:13:08,942
I'm not sure if that's possible, but maybe we can ask a city solicitor.

197
00:13:09,763 --> 00:13:10,903
I agree with you a hundred percent.

198
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:14,705
And I think everyone behind this reeling, uh, that, that, that drives a car.

199
00:13:15,385 --> 00:13:19,167
Um, that's all you see people on the phone constantly.

200
00:13:19,847 --> 00:13:21,208
Um, and they're not paying attention.

201
00:13:22,068 --> 00:13:26,410
Um, and, and that goes for, you know, you hate to say it, but it's not only on the phone,

202
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,160
I see people putting makeup on while they're driving.

203
00:13:29,581 --> 00:13:33,881
I see people doing a host of things while they're driving.

204
00:13:34,422 --> 00:13:41,703
And sometimes I'm in my car saying, please just drive your car because they'll be in the middle of the road, not moving while traffic's going around them.

205
00:13:41,743 --> 00:13:44,344
It's, it's just, it's, it's unbelievable in my opinion.

206
00:13:44,944 --> 00:13:56,086
And, uh, I read an article, I think it was a month or two ago in the globe that the number of tickets issued, uh, we would think because we have the texting ban that there's a lot of tickets being issued.

207
00:13:56,433 --> 00:14:01,076
It's minimal, if many at all, in this commonwealth.

208
00:14:01,676 --> 00:14:09,381
And one of the reasons is, like you mentioned, it's hard to pinpoint and catch someone in the act that could be dialing the phone, make a phone call, or so forth.

209
00:14:09,401 --> 00:14:10,702
And they have every excuse in the book.

210
00:14:11,643 --> 00:14:16,606
I like the hands-free ban, although when you're talking, you can still get distracted.

211
00:14:16,646 --> 00:14:19,168
But if you're talking to a passenger, you can be distracted.

212
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:23,871
So I think it's a step in the right direction to provide the safety we need on our streets.

213
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:34,358
So Mr. President, if I can make that in the form of a motion, if we as a community can implement our own hands-free ban within the perimeter of our city.

214
00:14:35,899 --> 00:14:36,359
Okay.

215
00:14:36,999 --> 00:14:37,719
Thank you very much.

216
00:14:38,099 --> 00:14:40,480
And I'm going to take a vote right now on the two motions.

217
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:45,042
One is for Councilor Knight, from Councilor Knight to refer this to the traffic commission.

218
00:14:45,622 --> 00:14:52,724
And that was amended as well by Councilor Marks to ask the city solicitor if the city of Medford can put their own ban in

219
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:56,402
to make it hands-free only while driving a vehicle.

220
00:14:57,083 --> 00:14:58,784
The clerk will call roll call vote.

221
00:14:59,704 --> 00:14:59,985
Please.

222
00:15:00,025 --> 00:15:00,865
The clerk will call the roll.

223
00:15:02,106 --> 00:15:02,446
Thank you.

224
00:15:06,509 --> 00:15:06,909
Yes.

225
00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:07,390
Yes.

226
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:07,990
Yes.

227
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:08,110
Yes.

228
00:15:18,769 --> 00:15:22,851
Yes, by a vote of seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes as amended.

229
00:15:23,011 --> 00:15:25,191
And thank you very much for your presentation this evening.

230
00:15:26,632 --> 00:15:29,173
Just a quick announcement, if the council will indulge me.

231
00:15:29,573 --> 00:15:43,218
The DPW this evening dropped off a package to the members of the city council to notify the residents of this community about the upcoming street sweeping, which will take place between November 3rd and November 24th throughout the community.

232
00:15:43,959 --> 00:15:47,820
The following places, publicly notifications have went out

233
00:15:48,334 --> 00:15:51,836
So if you have any questions or concerns, you can check one of these media outlets.

234
00:15:52,356 --> 00:15:58,960
The Medford transcript, the Medford Mercury, the Medford page on the Boston Globe, the patch made in Medford.

235
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:03,762
It's been posted in the library, the Council on Aging, City Hall.

236
00:16:04,302 --> 00:16:06,684
It's also on the city website at Medford.org.

237
00:16:07,444 --> 00:16:09,725
It's on the city of Medford's Facebook and Twitter page.

238
00:16:10,366 --> 00:16:12,587
Channel 15, which is the educational channel.

239
00:16:13,843 --> 00:16:19,032
Tufts University has been notified regarding all four of the students, the faculty, the graduates, and the staff.

240
00:16:20,235 --> 00:16:25,945
We'll be getting an email, as well as the Senior Sounds, that is the local newspaper.

241
00:16:26,404 --> 00:16:27,625
for our senior citizens.

242
00:16:28,405 --> 00:16:30,866
The flashing signs will be out as well as the A-frames.

243
00:16:31,687 --> 00:16:38,290
And Captain Clemente will be putting together a reverse 911 to notify different areas of their street sweeping.

244
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:42,072
So all these different venues you can go to.

245
00:16:42,472 --> 00:16:44,973
If you have any questions, you can call the mayor's office at 781-393-2408.

246
00:16:52,763 --> 00:17:01,772
Item 14-713, petition by Jeanne M. Martin, 10 Cummings Street, Medford, Mass., to address the Council about parking enforcement.

247
00:17:02,452 --> 00:17:02,632
Ms.

248
00:17:02,652 --> 00:17:02,913
Martin.

249
00:17:03,113 --> 00:17:03,453
Thank you.

250
00:17:03,693 --> 00:17:04,874
Jeanne Martin, 10 Cummings Street.

251
00:17:05,715 --> 00:17:07,517
Let's see.

252
00:17:08,076 --> 00:17:12,818
Parking enforcement should be a uniformed program throughout the city without exception.

253
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:16,600
This city has seen enough favoritism and it needs to stop.

254
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:23,863
All sections of the city should be mandated to abide by the parking rules in order to keep the streets free and clear for public use.

255
00:17:24,644 --> 00:17:27,945
A car on a public way is a privilege, not a right.

256
00:17:28,685 --> 00:17:29,546
I want to repeat that.

257
00:17:31,307 --> 00:17:35,869
A car on a public way is a privilege, not a right.

258
00:17:40,154 --> 00:17:54,376
Should this city find itself in a power outage, lockdown, or major snowstorm, DPW and emergency vehicles have the right of way, and no one should argue that their vehicle was destroyed if they are not abiding by the parking rules of the city.

259
00:17:55,637 --> 00:18:00,217
It also assists the national grid, telephone companies, and the like to provide services to you.

260
00:18:01,678 --> 00:18:08,859
Discontent among the masses will occur, and people with more influence in the city will ask for ticket forgiveness.

261
00:18:09,993 --> 00:18:10,934
This cannot stand.

262
00:18:12,815 --> 00:18:19,079
If you tweak the program, tweak it for all, not just for the well-connected in the city.

263
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:30,507
As for the money that comes from the tickets in the squares, this revenue needs to go towards signs in all sections of the city as the expansion of the program continues.

264
00:18:31,828 --> 00:18:35,491
We will need to hire ticketing personnel, and this will pay for itself.

265
00:18:36,431 --> 00:18:37,092
The mayor has

266
00:18:40,392 --> 00:18:47,536
In other words, spoiled all the citizens, but the business districts as well, because we should have had meters 10 years ago.

267
00:18:49,077 --> 00:18:50,137
And now they are balking.

268
00:18:51,178 --> 00:18:54,620
Most cities our size have had parking restrictions years ago.

269
00:18:56,341 --> 00:19:00,503
I am sorry that the mayor has indulged them, but the time has passed for free parking.

270
00:19:01,243 --> 00:19:04,045
A new day is dawning and a cost of business is inevitable.

271
00:19:05,073 --> 00:19:06,294
This is only the beginning.

272
00:19:06,754 --> 00:19:12,037
The people will be in this hall complaining once the broader city starts being tagged.

273
00:19:13,978 --> 00:19:18,520
I don't believe that the judicial piece of the enforcement should be in the hands of the mayor.

274
00:19:20,061 --> 00:19:22,482
He is clearly biased and will forgive his political friends.

275
00:19:23,723 --> 00:19:25,283
It should be someone outside City Hall.

276
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:33,868
Sadly, poor sections of the city will be fined more frequently and pay a higher cost of living, but this cannot be avoided.

277
00:19:35,043 --> 00:19:45,148
The least we can do is administer ticketing in a fair as possible through all sections of the city to decrease this tension the best we can.

278
00:19:46,168 --> 00:19:56,173
Commercial vehicles in front of fire hydrants, wheelchair spots and the like need to be ticketed in the nicer parts of the city so that everyone buys into the plan.

279
00:19:57,355 --> 00:20:00,176
it will mitigate some dissent and resentment.

280
00:20:00,776 --> 00:20:04,757
And I have a question for those that have read the report.

281
00:20:05,837 --> 00:20:12,399
Does this report deal with the issue of the people who already got permit parking?

282
00:20:12,859 --> 00:20:14,140
Like, I pay $10 a year.

283
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:22,602
Is that part of this contracting situation, where they're going to have personnel go around and check all the permit parking streets?

284
00:20:23,162 --> 00:20:23,402
OK.

285
00:20:23,982 --> 00:20:24,742
Thank you, Mr. Mark.

286
00:20:25,082 --> 00:20:25,343
OK.

287
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:26,363
And that's my statement.

288
00:20:26,383 --> 00:20:26,843
Thank you very much.

289
00:20:29,818 --> 00:20:31,399
What did you say?

290
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:32,580
Councillor Penta.

291
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,541
Jeannie, can you ask that question again?

292
00:20:35,561 --> 00:20:38,763
No.

293
00:20:39,483 --> 00:20:44,606
For those people that pay $10 a year, I paid $10 a year for, I don't know, five, six, seven years or whatever.

294
00:20:45,646 --> 00:20:47,127
My parents have been gone since 2008.

295
00:20:47,607 --> 00:20:52,230
So I've been paying since then $10 a year for parking enforcement on my street.

296
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:57,045
And we don't have parking enforcement in the city of Medford.

297
00:20:57,085 --> 00:20:58,846
Nobody comes around to take it on a regular basis.

298
00:20:59,927 --> 00:21:00,588
I have a corner.

299
00:21:00,648 --> 00:21:01,668
I have a dead end street.

300
00:21:02,209 --> 00:21:08,132
The corner has a person parked on there that shouldn't be there because it makes it narrow for emergency vehicles to come in and go out.

301
00:21:08,492 --> 00:21:11,294
It should be 100 feet from the corner, the sign, but it's not.

302
00:21:11,774 --> 00:21:16,918
So I'd like to have that removed so that there's nobody on the corner because there's only one way in and out of the street.

303
00:21:18,138 --> 00:21:18,919
So that was your question?

304
00:21:19,442 --> 00:21:26,424
Oh, my question is, with the ticketing, are you going to have personnel actually coming around?

305
00:21:26,604 --> 00:21:28,265
I know that the meters are going into the squares.

306
00:21:28,985 --> 00:21:35,748
But are there going to be people going around and giving tickets to the people who already have paid permit parking?

307
00:21:36,648 --> 00:21:44,931
From the way I understand it, in reading the addendums that we were given last week, there's anywhere from 2,500 to 2,600 stickers that have already been issued.

308
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:48,632
And I don't think they've been reissued as of July 1 of this year.

309
00:21:49,804 --> 00:21:54,465
That's a question, I believe, that needs to be answered because nobody's got the answer for that.

310
00:21:54,725 --> 00:21:56,686
I think she's talking resident permit parking.

311
00:21:57,946 --> 00:21:59,106
Yeah, resident permit parking.

312
00:21:59,126 --> 00:22:00,006
I paid $10 a year.

313
00:22:00,046 --> 00:22:02,027
It's going to be enforced under this proposal.

314
00:22:02,387 --> 00:22:03,047
Say it again, it's what?

315
00:22:03,087 --> 00:22:05,247
Resident permit parking is part of the enforcement.

316
00:22:06,268 --> 00:22:07,048
It is.

317
00:22:07,288 --> 00:22:08,688
Okay, so who's going to come around?

318
00:22:11,569 --> 00:22:12,649
The people from the contract.

319
00:22:12,869 --> 00:22:14,689
The contract people and the police department.

320
00:22:15,089 --> 00:22:17,030
They remain the right to give out tickets.

321
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:18,010
Okay, thank you.

322
00:22:18,984 --> 00:22:20,925
but there's two parts of that permit parking.

323
00:22:21,005 --> 00:22:23,006
One is residential, one is commercial.

324
00:22:23,046 --> 00:22:23,867
So I just didn't know.

325
00:22:24,127 --> 00:22:24,687
Oh, okay.

326
00:22:24,887 --> 00:22:25,767
I didn't understand that.

327
00:22:25,847 --> 00:22:26,368
Oh, I'm sorry.

328
00:22:26,488 --> 00:22:26,668
Yes.

329
00:22:27,048 --> 00:22:40,174
So I, my, my point is, is that I want this parking program to go citywide and I want it to be in all sections of the city so that there, that, um, it doesn't cause discontent among certain parts of the city up against other parts of the city.

330
00:22:40,494 --> 00:22:40,794
Thank you.

331
00:22:41,075 --> 00:22:43,636
Thank you on the motion of council night to receive and place on file.

332
00:22:43,756 --> 00:22:46,377
All those in favor, all those opposed, the ayes have it.

333
00:22:46,983 --> 00:22:51,366
Item 14-714, petition by Matthew Page Lieberman.

334
00:22:52,647 --> 00:22:56,670
Suspension of the rules has been requested by Councilor Lungo Kern.

335
00:22:56,710 --> 00:23:01,394
For which paper?

336
00:23:01,414 --> 00:23:01,894
14-715.

337
00:23:01,914 --> 00:23:02,274
14-715.

338
00:23:03,735 --> 00:23:04,416
All those in favor?

339
00:23:05,296 --> 00:23:05,957
All those opposed?

340
00:23:05,977 --> 00:23:06,517
The ayes have it.

341
00:23:07,658 --> 00:23:14,163
To the Honorable President and members of the Medford City Council, from Michael J. McGlynn-Meyer, paper 14-715.

342
00:23:16,872 --> 00:23:21,637
This is an expenditure from the law account request, and the description is as follows.

343
00:23:21,697 --> 00:23:28,443
The claimant, State Farm Insurance, as a sub-rookie for its... Motion to waive the reading and just give a brief synopsis, Mr. President.

344
00:23:28,643 --> 00:23:30,204
Motion to waive the reading by Councilor Marks.

345
00:23:30,244 --> 00:23:30,885
All those in favor?

346
00:23:31,145 --> 00:23:31,225
Aye.

347
00:23:31,405 --> 00:23:31,966
All those opposed?

348
00:23:31,986 --> 00:23:32,526
The ayes have it.

349
00:23:33,307 --> 00:23:37,091
The claimant is State Farm Insurance, and they're representing Mrs. Knoffs.

350
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:41,673
Her motor vehicle was struck while parked on Edison Avenue by a DPW sander.

351
00:23:42,314 --> 00:23:44,496
The city has received all releases.

352
00:23:45,096 --> 00:23:50,821
Our legal department, which is represented this evening by our assistant city solicitor.

353
00:23:53,683 --> 00:23:59,548
And the claim has been brought before this council for $4,498.94.

354
00:23:59,608 --> 00:24:00,509
The chair awaits a motion.

355
00:24:06,366 --> 00:24:13,272
On the motion of approval by Councilor DelaRusso, seconded by Councilor Lungo-Kern and Vice President Caravaglio, the clerk will call the roll.

356
00:24:16,855 --> 00:24:18,556
Vice President Caravaglio?

357
00:24:19,057 --> 00:24:19,277
Yes.

358
00:24:19,697 --> 00:24:20,498
Councilor DelaRusso?

359
00:24:20,538 --> 00:24:20,738
Yes.

360
00:24:21,219 --> 00:24:21,759
Councilor Knight?

361
00:24:21,799 --> 00:24:22,160
Yes.

362
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:23,180
Councilor Lungo-Kern?

363
00:24:23,481 --> 00:24:23,681
Yes.

364
00:24:24,021 --> 00:24:24,682
Councilor Marks?

365
00:24:24,782 --> 00:24:25,142
Yes.

366
00:24:25,262 --> 00:24:25,903
Councilor Penta?

367
00:24:26,083 --> 00:24:26,303
Yes.

368
00:24:26,824 --> 00:24:27,564
President Camuso?

369
00:24:27,884 --> 00:24:28,105
Yes.

370
00:24:28,165 --> 00:24:30,206
By a vote of seven in the affirmative, the paper passes.

371
00:24:30,687 --> 00:24:32,648
Thank you very much for coming this evening.

372
00:24:32,969 --> 00:24:33,729
Thank you, Mr. President.

373
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:39,052
On the motion to revert back to the regular order of business, all those in favor?

374
00:24:39,673 --> 00:24:40,233
All those opposed?

375
00:24:40,273 --> 00:24:40,793
The ayes have it.

376
00:24:40,893 --> 00:24:51,281
Item 14-714, petition by Matthew Page Lieberman, 15 Canal Street, number 15, Medford, Mass., to address the council about community access TV.

377
00:24:51,621 --> 00:24:52,782
Name and address for the record, sir.

378
00:24:53,122 --> 00:24:54,543
My name is Matthew Page Lieberman.

379
00:24:54,563 --> 00:24:57,285
I live at 15 Canal Street, apartment 15, West Medford.

380
00:24:58,385 --> 00:25:00,367
OK, I have not been here in four and a half years.

381
00:25:00,427 --> 00:25:01,928
And since then, there have been some changes.

382
00:25:02,448 --> 00:25:04,570
So I want to congratulate Adam Knight for being elected.

383
00:25:05,783 --> 00:25:11,286
and Councilor Caraviello too, as well as Paul for you being president, and Caraviello for vice president.

384
00:25:11,566 --> 00:25:12,427
It's a really nice change.

385
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:18,370
I'm here tonight because it's not actually about community access, but about government access.

386
00:25:20,492 --> 00:25:25,955
I'm working on a project in which I'm trying to create transcripts of city meetings.

387
00:25:26,915 --> 00:25:35,180
And I would like, because I'm disabled, and that's why I live in 15 Canal Street, so I also have a lot of sympathy for those who are disabled and hearing impaired.

388
00:25:36,724 --> 00:25:40,990
I also have a bit of sympathy for immigrants who do not speak English as a first language.

389
00:25:41,591 --> 00:25:48,562
So I'm creating a project to create transcripts of meetings and translations of them and captions of the meetings.

390
00:25:50,208 --> 00:25:59,838
As I said, I'm disabled, so I don't have a lot of money, but I did a couple weeks ago, I turned on cable in my house just so I could get these city council meetings, and I bought a device so I could record them.

391
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:07,967
What I would really like is if we could have the archives of our meetings be available online.

392
00:26:09,288 --> 00:26:12,830
Currently, we charge $20 to get an archive of a city council meeting.

393
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:15,451
This is something that I don't think we should be charged for.

394
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:19,033
If we go to neighboring Boston, Cambridge, or Somerville, it's completely free.

395
00:26:19,053 --> 00:26:19,833
You can go online.

396
00:26:20,553 --> 00:26:22,614
I've talked to quite a few people about this.

397
00:26:23,235 --> 00:26:32,879
And one person told me, I will not say the person's name, but I was told that it's extremely expensive for these long meetings and that there are no services that we could really use.

398
00:26:32,899 --> 00:26:34,760
I suggested Made in Medford.

399
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,061
And there's also this service called Screencast.

400
00:26:37,701 --> 00:26:39,162
that the school board uses.

401
00:26:39,562 --> 00:26:41,042
But I was told, it's just too expensive.

402
00:26:41,062 --> 00:26:49,686
These videos are too long, which from the person who told me this, I was kind of left with the impression this person isn't really knowledgeable about the state of technology today.

403
00:26:50,566 --> 00:26:55,448
There's Amazon charges about $0.03 for each gigabyte.

404
00:26:56,168 --> 00:26:59,449
And Google as well charges a little bit under $0.03 for each gigabyte.

405
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:03,451
Our meetings sometimes go for about two hours.

406
00:27:03,931 --> 00:27:05,171
That would come out to be about $0.06 or $0.07.

407
00:27:06,952 --> 00:27:09,195
to store a video each month.

408
00:27:09,635 --> 00:27:13,781
And then there are about 20 cents or so for people to download a whole thing.

409
00:27:14,301 --> 00:27:15,943
So this is something that would be...

410
00:27:17,722 --> 00:27:23,765
You know, it'd be not even like, you know, $20 a year, I think, when we consider this.

411
00:27:24,645 --> 00:27:27,767
Now, I'm currently working on archiving these things.

412
00:27:27,807 --> 00:27:28,988
Oh, I should get back to something.

413
00:27:29,748 --> 00:27:36,812
I was told by somebody that YouTube, if we were to upload videos to YouTube, that they just do not accept videos that are that long.

414
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:39,933
But there are people who upload videos to YouTube that are a day and a half long.

415
00:27:41,234 --> 00:27:45,176
And if we have interests about, you know, concerns about privacy,

416
00:27:45,994 --> 00:27:54,217
There's also a way that we can kind of configure YouTube so that nobody would be able to see city council meetings except for people that visit from a city site.

417
00:27:55,138 --> 00:27:56,238
We can make that private.

418
00:27:57,719 --> 00:27:59,879
So I mean, there are really quite a few options.

419
00:27:59,899 --> 00:28:02,500
Some are free options, and then some are only a few dollars a year.

420
00:28:02,881 --> 00:28:06,242
So we could store archives of city council meetings.

421
00:28:07,743 --> 00:28:13,365
So I have much interest in having these archived going forward, as well as archives of the previous meetings.

422
00:28:14,746 --> 00:28:30,117
As far as previous meetings, I think that the city should remove the $20 fee for previous meetings, and I would perfectly be willing to volunteer to archive meetings, perhaps 10 a week.

423
00:28:30,918 --> 00:28:35,441
It only takes about 15 minutes to take a DVD and turn it into a file.

424
00:28:36,682 --> 00:28:44,308
And if the city has any problems about privacy, you know, because I'm not a city employee, I'm just volunteering, you know, I could lobby the mayor and say I will work for a dollar a year.

425
00:28:44,328 --> 00:28:46,970
Matt, can you just step back from the mic a little bit?

426
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:47,830
It's coming over muffled.

427
00:28:48,051 --> 00:28:48,611
Sure, sure, sure.

428
00:28:49,512 --> 00:28:50,732
Yeah, I did get that feeling.

429
00:28:51,573 --> 00:28:53,514
But, I mean, that's about it.

430
00:28:54,683 --> 00:29:01,546
You know, I would like, I'm doing a lot of this as a volunteer, and I would just kind of know how the city feels about this.

431
00:29:01,586 --> 00:29:09,349
I think by, you know, kind of catching up with some neighboring cities, we can perhaps increase citizen interest and participation.

432
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:15,032
The reason that I record meetings also is that I go to something that's every Tuesday at 7 o'clock.

433
00:29:16,452 --> 00:29:18,313
So, I mean, if there are any questions, that's about it.

434
00:29:20,854 --> 00:29:22,355
Thank you very much for your presentation.

435
00:29:22,495 --> 00:29:22,795
Thank you.

436
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:24,740
Councilor Marks.

437
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:33,665
Through you to actually the city clerk, why is it so expensive to get a copy of the meeting?

438
00:29:33,725 --> 00:29:34,886
Is it $20 to get a copy?

439
00:29:37,127 --> 00:29:38,388
So that was set by this council?

440
00:29:39,128 --> 00:29:41,770
How far back?

441
00:29:43,511 --> 00:29:45,252
Probably back when we started to

442
00:29:51,953 --> 00:29:53,554
2000 maybe.

443
00:29:53,574 --> 00:29:53,554
2000.

444
00:29:54,694 --> 00:29:58,476
What would the actual cost be for the actual CD itself and the time?

445
00:29:58,496 --> 00:30:02,418
I think it's mostly the, uh, it's not the actual material.

446
00:30:02,438 --> 00:30:17,905
I think it's the time that the person has to invest because in a public records, if you're requesting public records, a lot of times you've charged, um, if someone has to copy something, you assign that person, um, to do the copy and the labor.

447
00:30:18,662 --> 00:30:22,185
And so that particular person is on a public records request.

448
00:30:23,405 --> 00:30:28,729
Whatever that salary per hour, that's what you kind of make your basis on.

449
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:34,253
So if a person's making $18 an hour, it's almost kind of like if it takes an hour.

450
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:40,938
And you got to remember, this person was set, I think, when we were doing VHS originally.

451
00:30:41,198 --> 00:30:46,482
Because VHS was a slow process, where if you had a two hour meeting, you actually had to pop in a tape.

452
00:30:47,052 --> 00:30:51,153
and sit there for two and a half hours, you know, transfer it and take it.

453
00:30:51,313 --> 00:30:56,054
It just seems $20 seems a little excessive for someone to get a copy of a meeting.

454
00:30:56,735 --> 00:31:02,236
Um, also the meetings used to be, uh, copied onto the channel three website.

455
00:31:02,256 --> 00:31:06,077
Uh, and they did that for, geez, that's probably say close to a year.

456
00:31:06,557 --> 00:31:08,918
And then as we know, when channel three closed, that stopped.

457
00:31:09,598 --> 00:31:16,100
Uh, and I'm thinking Mr. President, if there's a way to get it onto the city website, uh, the council has an area for,

458
00:31:16,745 --> 00:31:26,792
the city council that list all of us and our email addresses and so forth, and why can't we get a copy burned into the city website of taped council meetings?

459
00:31:27,313 --> 00:31:37,600
It's a great way for access to residents, and we always talk about open government, and I think that would serve well for our community.

460
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:39,601
So I would offer that, Mr. President.

461
00:31:41,242 --> 00:31:48,708
Councilor Marks to look into uploading, I think is the proper word, our meetings onto the City of Medford's webpage.

462
00:31:49,108 --> 00:31:49,789
All those in favor?

463
00:31:49,809 --> 00:31:50,950
Aye.

464
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:51,690
All those opposed?

465
00:31:51,751 --> 00:31:53,932
Before the roll is called, Councilor Knight.

466
00:31:54,773 --> 00:31:56,034
Thank you very much, Mr. President.

467
00:31:56,414 --> 00:32:03,320
And I've had some conversations with Matthew about this very same endeavor that he's looking to spearhead, and I think it's a great idea.

468
00:32:04,751 --> 00:32:08,634
I, too, have some concern about the $20 fee to be charged to get a copy of the tape.

469
00:32:08,674 --> 00:32:19,862
And I think that it might make sense for our rules committee to take a look at the fee structure that we use for providing an archived copy of the tape to a member of the general public who wishes to have a copy, Mr. President.

470
00:32:19,902 --> 00:32:21,964
So I'd like to add that to the paper as well.

471
00:32:21,984 --> 00:32:29,409
We refer the issue of the cost of a copy of the tape to our rules committee for investigation and to maybe establish a fee structure.

472
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,241
Councillor DelaRusso.

473
00:32:35,521 --> 00:32:56,972
I don't want to complicate matters at all by sharing this piece of information, but if one were to go to the town clerk of Winchester for a piece of paper this big with a raised seal, a certified copy of a death certificate, which takes eight minutes for the secretary to produce for you, costs $18.

474
00:32:57,272 --> 00:32:57,752
Thank you.

475
00:33:04,281 --> 00:33:10,083
Councilor Mox, as well as amended to send this to the Rules Committee to review by Councilor Knight.

476
00:33:10,563 --> 00:33:11,284
All those in favor?

477
00:33:11,924 --> 00:33:12,484
All those opposed?

478
00:33:12,504 --> 00:33:13,004
The ayes have it.

479
00:33:13,724 --> 00:33:19,046
On the motion of Councilor Knight for suspension of Rule 33, all those in favor?

480
00:33:20,567 --> 00:33:21,227
All those opposed?

481
00:33:21,267 --> 00:33:23,368
For the items in the hands of the clerk.

482
00:33:24,028 --> 00:33:28,750
Item 14-711, offered by Vice President Caraviello.

483
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:33,872
Please discuss the upcoming street sweeping program and the different types of announcements to the public.

484
00:33:34,743 --> 00:33:35,464
I did this earlier.

485
00:33:35,504 --> 00:33:37,325
I did not know we had a paper under suspensions.

486
00:33:37,345 --> 00:33:38,566
I apologize, vice president.

487
00:33:41,088 --> 00:33:41,989
Suspension of the rules.

488
00:33:42,289 --> 00:33:44,490
That one rule.

489
00:33:45,091 --> 00:33:48,093
Yeah, rule 33 is the rule to take different papers out of order.

490
00:33:48,514 --> 00:33:49,634
That's the specific rule.

491
00:33:50,755 --> 00:33:51,516
Thank you, Mr. President.

492
00:33:52,417 --> 00:34:01,283
I brought this forward to, rather than being reactive, after the sweeping is done, everybody's coming down and screaming that they weren't notified.

493
00:34:03,681 --> 00:34:06,883
If we brought this up tonight, we'd be a little more proactive and let people know.

494
00:34:06,903 --> 00:34:14,549
I mean, there's 18 different avenues of advertisement for our residents to find out about the street reporting.

495
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:30,080
The only suggestion I have, on top of the 18 different ways, is to have the police cars drive in advance of the street sweeping with the sirens on, like they've done in the past, and on the bullhorns.

496
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:31,661
So this way, for the people who

497
00:34:32,078 --> 00:34:36,662
Because you always get the people saying my mother just came over for ten minutes and the car got towed.

498
00:34:38,023 --> 00:34:49,672
If the chief would have the officers driving up and down the streets, maybe about ten or 15 minutes before the sweeper, with an announcement and siren, hopefully that will alleviate some of the problems too.

499
00:34:49,992 --> 00:34:58,418
And if you also, if you look back, all the cars that were towed last year were cars of non-Method residents also, Mr. President.

500
00:34:59,059 --> 00:35:00,480
So let's hope this year,

501
00:35:01,336 --> 00:35:05,660
There'll be less towing, and then hopefully everyone will get the message about the program.

502
00:35:07,101 --> 00:35:07,381
Thank you.

503
00:35:07,421 --> 00:35:10,063
On the motion of the Vice President Caravello, all those in favor?

504
00:35:10,083 --> 00:35:10,463
Aye.

505
00:35:10,863 --> 00:35:11,504
All those opposed?

506
00:35:11,524 --> 00:35:12,064
The ayes have it.

507
00:35:12,785 --> 00:35:20,491
Offered by Councilor Mox, be it resolved that the administration provide the council with the details regarding handicapped parking under the new parking plan.

508
00:35:20,751 --> 00:35:21,331
Councilor Mox.

509
00:35:22,792 --> 00:35:23,673
Thank you, Mr. President.

510
00:35:23,693 --> 00:35:29,898
I received an email a day or two ago regarding the mayor's new parking program.

511
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:45,111
And the woman asked me if the handicapped spots that are in our business districts and throughout our cities that are on also resident permit parking areas will remain the same.

512
00:35:45,432 --> 00:35:48,454
Will they be the same number of spots in the community?

513
00:35:49,154 --> 00:35:58,742
And this paper is to ask the administration, where they are the ones that signed the contract and are most familiar with the contract, what is the

514
00:36:00,082 --> 00:36:09,668
proposal call for regarding handicap parking and are there any changes to the number of existing spots that currently exist in our community, Mr. President?

515
00:36:12,149 --> 00:36:13,170
Councillor DelaRusso.

516
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:16,171
I'm grateful for the Councillor to bring this up.

517
00:36:16,652 --> 00:36:21,494
And we just had another presentation by a good citizen regarding this parking thing.

518
00:36:22,255 --> 00:36:25,757
Now that it's been signed, we know it's coming.

519
00:36:27,377 --> 00:36:28,138
One would think

520
00:36:29,369 --> 00:36:36,494
that there'd be some degree of public announcement saying, we've signed this contract.

521
00:36:37,155 --> 00:36:38,035
Stay tuned.

522
00:36:39,196 --> 00:36:45,241
The second week of November, we'll have a preliminary explanation of what this is going to be like for the citizens.

523
00:36:46,121 --> 00:36:46,942
Don't worry yet.

524
00:36:47,743 --> 00:36:51,645
The parking plan will take effect on exit date.

525
00:36:51,786 --> 00:36:55,588
We've received no information from those responsible for this.

526
00:36:56,328 --> 00:36:59,871
And I think that's what the citizens deserve, Mr. President.

527
00:37:00,391 --> 00:37:14,780
And if I could amend, if Councilor Marks agrees to it, amend his resolution that the city administration offer a preliminary

528
00:37:15,778 --> 00:37:30,721
a word to the public of announcement and explanation of the parameters of the parking policies so that people can be prepared in fears that are well-founded can be allayed.

529
00:37:32,561 --> 00:37:34,601
On the motion as amended, Councilor Penta.

530
00:37:34,761 --> 00:37:41,883
Mr. President, I can appreciate both Councilor Marks and Councilor De La Russo and their issues, but once we take paper 14-701 off the table,

531
00:37:44,144 --> 00:37:47,445
and talking about the contract, which we were given last week.

532
00:37:47,725 --> 00:37:48,745
Unfortunately, you weren't here.

533
00:37:49,165 --> 00:37:49,705
You were sick.

534
00:37:50,665 --> 00:37:59,907
I think we can get into, I think we can get into what you're talking about because there's a way to have this not only explained, but there's some issues in here that I don't believe that the council is aware of.

535
00:38:00,588 --> 00:38:07,929
And so I'm glad we did get the contract and after reviewing it, there's some issues we'd like to talk.

536
00:38:08,349 --> 00:38:09,269
Are we still on the suspension?

537
00:38:09,309 --> 00:38:11,050
Thank you.

538
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:12,030
So could we take,

539
00:38:12,489 --> 00:38:15,130
Okay, let's take a vote on this paper, and then we'll take that.

540
00:38:15,691 --> 00:38:17,812
On the motion as amended, all those in favor?

541
00:38:18,252 --> 00:38:18,352
Aye.

542
00:38:18,692 --> 00:38:19,393
All those opposed?

543
00:38:19,413 --> 00:38:19,973
The ayes have it.

544
00:38:21,174 --> 00:38:23,615
And which paper, Councilman?

545
00:38:23,815 --> 00:38:24,516
It's 14701.

546
00:38:24,716 --> 00:38:26,177
It was tabled last week.

547
00:38:26,197 --> 00:38:29,659
Do you have that paper?

548
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:33,160
14701, City Council's official position on the pay-to-park contract.

549
00:38:35,482 --> 00:38:36,002
On the motion?

550
00:38:36,462 --> 00:38:37,183
To take it off the table.

551
00:38:37,283 --> 00:38:38,143
To take it off the table.

552
00:38:38,263 --> 00:38:38,904
All those in favor?

553
00:38:39,324 --> 00:38:39,424
Aye.

554
00:38:40,164 --> 00:38:40,745
All those opposed?

555
00:38:40,765 --> 00:38:41,265
The ayes have it.

556
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:42,961
Councilor Penta.

557
00:38:43,101 --> 00:38:48,885
Mr. President, last week we were received because the council had asked for a copy of the contract.

558
00:38:49,505 --> 00:38:56,791
We were given a, a disc copy, which talked about the five addendums to the contract.

559
00:38:57,291 --> 00:38:59,673
Then we were given the hard copy contract.

560
00:39:00,434 --> 00:39:09,861
Um, and I read the contract twice and then I went back and I read what was given to us on September 10th twice.

561
00:39:10,881 --> 00:39:11,442
And there's only,

562
00:39:12,488 --> 00:39:13,589
One, one, two.

563
00:39:13,969 --> 00:39:20,272
There's only five words that made a change in the whole contract, under the whole proposal.

564
00:39:21,453 --> 00:39:26,456
And it comes under the procurement of meters, equipment, and vehicles.

565
00:39:26,676 --> 00:39:36,121
And at the very end, it basically says the cost of the vehicles and the required accessories, x, x, x, x, x. That was in the September 9th.

566
00:39:36,901 --> 00:39:39,383
In the October 7th, the cost of the vehicles

567
00:39:42,132 --> 00:39:44,193
is going to be provided by the operator.

568
00:39:44,213 --> 00:39:52,996
That's the only change in language that we have from September 9th through October 7th and what we got.

569
00:39:53,716 --> 00:40:05,800
We were also told and we were given, we did receive as public information provided by the mayor himself that he sent out a press release on October 7th indicating that he had signed it.

570
00:40:06,741 --> 00:40:10,862
And there was one, two, three, four, there were four inclusions in that recommendation page.

571
00:40:11,539 --> 00:40:18,983
where he indicates after deliberating and discussing concerns raised by the business community, the mayor is recommending the following changes to the plan.

572
00:40:19,383 --> 00:40:26,246
And the four issues that were raised are nowhere, nowhere to be found in the contract, no by reference or otherwise.

573
00:40:26,886 --> 00:40:40,453
So the contract proposal as preliminary on September 10th and the final one that was signed by the mayor on October 7th does not have those recommendations that he supposedly

574
00:40:40,803 --> 00:40:48,066
put in his public press release that, you know, again, it gives a false representation as to what's going on.

575
00:40:48,926 --> 00:40:53,448
Also, Mr. President, we got in this disk there — strike that.

576
00:40:53,468 --> 00:40:55,309
Let's just go to the contract first.

577
00:40:55,789 --> 00:41:07,353
In the contract, there is some representation — and I don't know how this got by anybody — but there's some representation that says, this contract includes, but is not limited to, the 987

578
00:41:09,928 --> 00:41:13,911
metered spaces that exist at the commencement of this agreement.

579
00:41:14,211 --> 00:41:16,933
There is no metered spaces in the city of Medford right now.

580
00:41:17,974 --> 00:41:22,637
So how do they determine 987 metered spots?

581
00:41:23,198 --> 00:41:24,238
I have absolutely no idea.

582
00:41:25,699 --> 00:41:27,461
And I think that needs to be explained further.

583
00:41:28,281 --> 00:41:37,468
Also, as you continue on, it should go to, I think, under the rent, under the section rent in the contract, it says years eight, nine, and 10.

584
00:41:38,631 --> 00:41:51,402
provided the city exercises its option to extend the agreement, as stated herein, operators shall continue to pay the city the guaranteed rent in continuation of paragraph 1A, which is the contract.

585
00:41:52,242 --> 00:41:57,066
So if you're looking and you're reading this, is this a seven-year contract or is this a 10-year contract?

586
00:41:57,587 --> 00:41:59,308
Because 8, 9, and 10 are option years.

587
00:42:00,089 --> 00:42:07,195
And as we all know, under option years, under the law, the city's procurement officer has to demonstrate by giving to the council

588
00:42:08,047 --> 00:42:16,669
a comparison of not only the figures that we presently have, but the difference between they doing it, X, or the city of Medford doing it.

589
00:42:17,669 --> 00:42:23,691
That is not explained in here, other than the fact that eight, nine, and 10 appears to be option-type years.

590
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:28,652
So the question is, is this a seven-year contract, or is it a 10-year contract?

591
00:42:29,072 --> 00:42:29,493
I don't know.

592
00:42:30,933 --> 00:42:31,693
These are questions.

593
00:42:32,493 --> 00:42:35,194
Also, the contract, as you continue on,

594
00:42:35,982 --> 00:42:40,664
has some questions as it relates to, once again, liability regarding certain issues.

595
00:42:41,444 --> 00:42:59,470
And the liability questions that present itself, I think, directly go to what Councilman Knox was alluding to in the issues of handicapped accessibility, who's going to be responsible, and the placing and the locations of the handicapped accessibility.

596
00:43:00,370 --> 00:43:05,752
Also, I believe, as Councilor De La Ruza just alluded to, I don't think it's the responsibility of this council

597
00:43:06,263 --> 00:43:07,784
to explain anything to anybody.

598
00:43:07,804 --> 00:43:09,945
This is the mayor's proposal.

599
00:43:13,767 --> 00:43:14,668
Councilor DelaRusso.

600
00:43:15,668 --> 00:43:18,330
I didn't suggest that the council do an explanation.

601
00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:27,575
I suggested that the city administration have the burden and the responsibility to make an explanation.

602
00:43:27,695 --> 00:43:28,435
Well, I apologize.

603
00:43:28,495 --> 00:43:29,175
I misunderstood.

604
00:43:29,396 --> 00:43:29,756
Thank you.

605
00:43:29,816 --> 00:43:30,176
I thank you.

606
00:43:30,276 --> 00:43:30,816
I thought you had.

607
00:43:30,836 --> 00:43:33,598
Thank you for your kind apology, Councilor.

608
00:43:34,258 --> 00:43:34,979
Thank you, Councilor.

609
00:43:36,182 --> 00:43:36,502
Thank you.

610
00:43:36,863 --> 00:43:37,823
That's in the contract.

611
00:43:38,184 --> 00:43:44,169
I think if you go now to the addendums that were given to us in the video of last week, this is very, very telling.

612
00:43:45,029 --> 00:43:48,212
If you go to addendum number, let's do them one at a time.

613
00:43:48,972 --> 00:43:56,378
From addendum number three, question is the following.

614
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:00,922
If the city, wait a minute, excuse me.

615
00:44:01,022 --> 00:44:05,606
The question is, how many residential permits are issued annually and what is the cost per permit?

616
00:44:06,324 --> 00:44:08,245
First answer is between 25 to 2,600.

617
00:44:08,565 --> 00:44:12,867
1,000 is a huge difference.

618
00:44:13,728 --> 00:44:17,390
If it was 15, 20, or 100, I think that could be understandable.

619
00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:27,475
How could you have 1,000 and a discrepancy such as that, unless the figures haven't been calculated to be more accurate?

620
00:44:27,615 --> 00:44:28,075
I don't know.

621
00:44:29,336 --> 00:44:33,058
Also, the real big question, and this was one, Jeanne Mutton,

622
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:36,602
This was one that was brought up at the meeting over and over again.

623
00:44:36,622 --> 00:44:39,143
Okay, and it says the following.

624
00:44:39,563 --> 00:44:47,407
Will all existing parking signage need to be replaced or will existing parking signage be permitted to remain?

625
00:44:47,887 --> 00:44:51,870
The city's answer, existing signage will be permitted to remain.

626
00:44:52,090 --> 00:44:58,213
It is in good condition and reflects all the information necessary for notice of parking restrictions.

627
00:44:58,853 --> 00:45:01,635
Now, show me a parking,

628
00:45:03,972 --> 00:45:09,596
identification that even talks about kiosks, nevermind the meters, that's existing.

629
00:45:10,037 --> 00:45:11,558
We don't have it because they don't exist.

630
00:45:13,039 --> 00:45:16,862
And I don't understand how the city can go forward and make that kind of a thing.

631
00:45:16,922 --> 00:45:21,546
It reflects all the information necessary for notice of parking restrictions.

632
00:45:22,887 --> 00:45:23,928
I just don't understand that.

633
00:45:24,768 --> 00:45:29,112
Then you go a little bit step further when from addendum number two,

634
00:45:29,794 --> 00:45:42,484
It says, who is responsible for the upkeep of the municipal lots including sweeping, cleaning, snow plowing, pothole, maintenance, lighting, and re-striping if necessary?

635
00:45:44,165 --> 00:45:48,228
City's answer, the city will continue to maintain the municipal lots.

636
00:45:48,890 --> 00:46:03,396
My question is this, when it snows, and we've seen it on numerous occasions, and some of those sidewalks are inundated with mounds and mounds of snow, is the city going to be responsible to go out there and shovel out the kiosks?

637
00:46:04,557 --> 00:46:09,019
Are you going to tell the business people that you've got to go out and shovel out the kiosks?

638
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:16,702
I don't understand why nobody had the idea to think into this and to get to that point, because that is going to be an issue.

639
00:46:17,541 --> 00:46:25,128
When there's a serious snowstorm in this city, it's bad enough that the city has to go out there with their plows and do what's necessary to make sure that the streets are open for public safety.

640
00:46:25,808 --> 00:46:37,399
But when you're dealing with kiosks throughout the city, and you have almost 1,700, 1,800 of these that are going to represent parking spaces for, I don't know, how many kiosks that they're going to have, who's going to be responsible?

641
00:46:37,619 --> 00:46:37,819
City?

642
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:46,421
I don't know if my colleague misspoke, but I believe there's only gonna be 85 kiosks.

643
00:46:46,901 --> 00:46:48,041
I didn't finish, you know, let me finish.

644
00:46:48,621 --> 00:46:49,081
Okay, you said 1,700.

645
00:46:49,761 --> 00:47:03,444
No, the 1,700 spots for which 85, allegedly 85 to 89 kiosks are going to be managing those 85, those 85 kiosks will be managing the 1,700 or 1,800 spots.

646
00:47:04,785 --> 00:47:05,005
Get it?

647
00:47:05,445 --> 00:47:05,925
On the street?

648
00:47:06,185 --> 00:47:06,385
Yes.

649
00:47:07,965 --> 00:47:09,025
It's only a thousand spots.

650
00:47:09,185 --> 00:47:11,826
Point of clarification, Councilor Lungo-Kern.

651
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:16,082
Page two of the agreement says there's 987 spots.

652
00:47:18,444 --> 00:47:23,467
Well, then you know something, the numbers, there's something wrong with these numbers then.

653
00:47:23,707 --> 00:47:27,069
3,700 parking permits for business commuters and residential.

654
00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:30,231
Councilor DelaRusso, point of information.

655
00:47:30,572 --> 00:47:38,197
I'm wondering if, since we've asked for an explanation from the city authority to explain this program,

656
00:47:39,670 --> 00:47:44,432
our discussions might be more fruitful if we had a person here rather than speculate.

657
00:47:46,573 --> 00:47:50,235
Well, we were asked to review this council DelaRusso last week, and that's what I did.

658
00:47:50,835 --> 00:47:57,017
The next question is, does the city have any other studies that provide projected revenues for paid parking?

659
00:47:57,077 --> 00:47:59,679
And if so, the city, please provide the studies.

660
00:47:59,959 --> 00:48:02,840
And the answer is the city does not have any other studies.

661
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:07,722
This council asked to have its own independent study and all we were told

662
00:48:07,985 --> 00:48:20,531
It would be more expensive than that, because we got that as part of, quote, a confidential piece of paper that we weren't supposed to disclose to anyone that had nothing that verified that the facts that they were presenting were right.

663
00:48:21,391 --> 00:48:35,098
Also, in the RFP that went out, the question was asked of them if, in fact, they would submit or produce two references

664
00:48:35,622 --> 00:48:43,628
And two references that were the closest to the city of Medford for which this company, this company, Republic from Tennessee worked for.

665
00:48:43,648 --> 00:48:45,930
And that's no way that I don't know where it is.

666
00:48:45,990 --> 00:48:58,820
It may be in city hall someplace, but it would have been nice for the council to have had that as backup to the fact that if mayor thinks this is such a great company and it's just a wonderful job, these are the two backups that were asked for and that were acknowledged.

667
00:48:59,801 --> 00:49:04,705
Also, I think that what needs to needs to be understood is

668
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:23,025
Last week we were also told, strike that, two weeks we were also told when the President of the Chamber of Commerce were here that the Chamber, Government Affairs Committee, and the Chamber's Board of Directors presented to the Mayor that they were in favor of this pay-to-park program.

669
00:49:24,426 --> 00:49:33,949
The letter dated September 26, 2014, by the President, Mr. White, in a four-page, five-page, I mean, five-paragraph, doesn't indicate that at all.

670
00:49:34,629 --> 00:49:35,289
It indicates

671
00:49:36,285 --> 00:49:39,066
of their interest in it, but it indicates very clearly.

672
00:49:39,506 --> 00:49:48,270
We also recognize that from business center to business center, our members have different parking needs and varying concerns with the enforcement plan.

673
00:49:49,290 --> 00:49:52,452
We would like to provide a forum for our members to voice their concerns.

674
00:49:53,112 --> 00:50:02,196
It is important that the chamber be involved with any additional planning or public meetings in distributing such information so that we can serve our members appropriately.

675
00:50:02,756 --> 00:50:05,677
That letter is not an endorsement of a pay-to-park program.

676
00:50:07,668 --> 00:50:09,269
Point of information, Counselor Knight.

677
00:50:09,469 --> 00:50:18,214
I believe the letter that Counselor Penta refers to was sent to the administration prior to the recommendations being made that the Counselor referred to at the beginning of his soliloquy.

678
00:50:19,595 --> 00:50:20,135
Thank you, Counselor.

679
00:50:20,155 --> 00:50:30,641
My answer to that is the letter that was sent to the administration by Mr. White, Mr. Call, and Janet Donnelly never was presented to the entire membership.

680
00:50:31,142 --> 00:50:33,363
And this was presented on September 26th.

681
00:50:34,003 --> 00:50:36,945
So, as Mr. White indicated when he was at that forum,

682
00:50:37,634 --> 00:50:41,535
that the Government Affairs Committee and the Board of Directors endorsed the pay-to-park program.

683
00:50:41,975 --> 00:50:43,816
The pay-to-park program wasn't even signed.

684
00:50:44,356 --> 00:50:45,377
So that's number one.

685
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:58,481
Number two, it's quite obvious that this coincides to the commentary that was represented in the Medford transcript that the business community and the business squares are concerned and they have varying indifference of opinions.

686
00:50:58,941 --> 00:51:07,404
Now, you can agree or disagree with what's going on because the commentary subsequent to that, which was issued on October 7th by the mayor of this community,

687
00:51:08,053 --> 00:51:12,294
says he met with the chamber, and they agreed, and they come up with these four recommendations.

688
00:51:12,574 --> 00:51:14,555
These aren't four inclusions in the contract.

689
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:16,356
These are only recommendations.

690
00:51:16,936 --> 00:51:23,778
And if they're only recommendations, and they're not going to be effective, because the council, strike that, because the contract in and of itself says, that's it.

691
00:51:23,818 --> 00:51:25,138
This is the final terminology.

692
00:51:26,919 --> 00:51:30,600
I don't know how a recommendation can come into play, number one.

693
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:37,142
And number two, if it's not included in the contract, and not even incorporated by reference, that's number one.

694
00:51:38,285 --> 00:51:41,466
It doesn't even talk about how many people even bid for the contract.

695
00:51:42,027 --> 00:51:58,794
Speaking with folks who are professional in public bidding contracts here in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, we were led to believe in our executive session on May 20th that we had to choose this one particular individual, because that's what the mayor was recommending at the time.

696
00:51:59,454 --> 00:52:01,915
But we had three legitimate people.

697
00:52:02,753 --> 00:52:05,175
who had submitted to the RFP.

698
00:52:05,675 --> 00:52:15,082
We never got those figures from the three people in their bidding process to make an intelligent decision to make the final decision or make the decision who we're going to take.

699
00:52:15,803 --> 00:52:19,085
So this was only... Point of information, Councilor Knight.

700
00:52:19,506 --> 00:52:28,833
I do believe, if I recall correctly, that the only matter that was before the council that evening is whether or not the council was going to authorize the mayor to enter into a contract that would be 10 years in length.

701
00:52:29,093 --> 00:52:31,955
The actual contracted entity

702
00:52:32,355 --> 00:52:33,456
was not up for discussion.

703
00:52:33,496 --> 00:52:34,956
That was not within our purview that evening.

704
00:52:36,177 --> 00:52:43,741
I'm going to respectfully disagree with my colleagues because the meeting did take place with the fact that we were going to be informed as to where we were going on the RFP.

705
00:52:44,201 --> 00:52:44,541
Uh, Ms.

706
00:52:45,001 --> 00:52:49,403
Louise Miller was there and unfortunately she didn't have an opportunity to speak why they didn't let her speak.

707
00:52:49,684 --> 00:52:51,404
But there were three people who submitted bids.

708
00:52:51,745 --> 00:52:53,325
The mayor decided to choose only one.

709
00:52:53,686 --> 00:52:57,127
The mayor's request to the council was at that point in time, do we go forward with this one?

710
00:52:57,387 --> 00:52:58,528
I needed your opinion on that.

711
00:52:58,808 --> 00:53:00,649
So none of us had any of an opportunity.

712
00:53:01,372 --> 00:53:07,795
any opportunity to even understand who the other two people were if they were legitimate because they satisfied the RFP that the city sent out.

713
00:53:08,576 --> 00:53:26,224
You know, if this is going to be an open and transparent process, and we're supposed to get the biggest bang for our buck, who knows that maybe one of the other two that wasn't chosen or didn't submit couldn't have given a better deal, or at least offered something for some of us to say, well, wait a minute, let's take a comparison.

714
00:53:26,644 --> 00:53:29,866
That for which we never even had the opportunity, didn't even have the opportunity,

715
00:53:30,270 --> 00:53:31,351
to getting one from the city.

716
00:53:31,911 --> 00:53:54,550
You know, how do you turn around and hand someone on October 7th to the council, the contract that was signed, have a press release go out that day, which is exactly the same thing that was given to us on September 10th, minusing out five words, but identifies allegedly metered spots in the city that we have.

717
00:53:54,591 --> 00:53:57,493
There is not one metered spot in the city of Medford.

718
00:53:58,373 --> 00:54:04,158
And that would be crucial to this contract, because if it's a meted spot, it needs to be identified.

719
00:54:04,679 --> 00:54:22,074
And having no meted spots to be identified tells me, or at least reads it, I'm not the lawyer, we have lawyers on the council here, that basically would tell you if it's an unidentifiable location as stated in here to be identified,

720
00:54:22,444 --> 00:54:28,048
Well, that presents a difference of opinion as to what are we signing in for and what are we getting.

721
00:54:28,608 --> 00:54:32,591
But more importantly, the fact of kiosks, snow, responsibility.

722
00:54:33,872 --> 00:54:34,512
Is it 987?

723
00:54:34,592 --> 00:54:40,716
Is it 2,600 or 2,500 permanent parking stickers?

724
00:54:41,117 --> 00:54:42,277
How many actually is it going to be?

725
00:54:42,938 --> 00:54:44,159
Who's going to maintain the parking lot?

726
00:54:44,179 --> 00:54:46,060
For example, the parking lot up on Boston Avenue.

727
00:54:46,860 --> 00:54:50,083
90% of that parking lot, even though the city has its signs, is privately owned.

728
00:54:51,070 --> 00:54:52,031
So what are they going to do with that?

729
00:54:52,631 --> 00:54:55,092
Put kiosks on somebody's privately-owned property?

730
00:54:56,453 --> 00:55:10,741
I got calls this week from folks who want to know, who are business people, and I won't mention their names, who's exempt and who isn't exempt, because there are a lot of commercial pieces of property in this city that people are going to want to know.

731
00:55:10,761 --> 00:55:10,841
Who?

732
00:55:10,861 --> 00:55:10,941
Who?

733
00:55:10,961 --> 00:55:11,081
Who?

734
00:55:11,101 --> 00:55:11,161
Who?

735
00:55:11,862 --> 00:55:11,962
Who?

736
00:55:11,982 --> 00:55:12,042
Who?

737
00:55:12,062 --> 00:55:12,122
Who?

738
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:12,202
Who?

739

Who?

740
00:55:12,302 --> 00:55:12,362

00:55:17,685 --> 00:55:17,785
Who?

787
00:55:17,805 --> 00:55:17,865
Who?

788
00:55:17,885 --> 00:55:17,945
Who?

789
00:55:17,965 --> 00:55:18,025
Who?

790
00:55:18,045 --> 00:55:18,105
Who?

791
00:55:18,125 --> 00:55:18,205
Who?

792
00:55:18,225 --> 00:55:18,305
Who?

793
00:55:18,325 --> 00:55:18,405
Who?

794
00:55:18,425 --> 00:55:18,505
Who?

795
00:55:18,525 --> 00:55:18,585
Who?

796
00:55:18,605 --> 00:55:18,686
Who?

797
00:55:18,726 --> 00:55:18,826
Who?

798
00:55:18,866 --> 00:55:18,966
Who?

799
00:55:18,986 --> 00:55:19,086
Who?

800
00:55:19,106 --> 00:55:19,206
Who?

801
00:55:19,226 --> 00:55:19,286
Who?

802
00:55:19,306 --> 00:55:19,386
Who?

803
00:55:19,406 --> 00:55:19,526
Who?

804
00:55:20,045 --> 00:55:29,071
We were told in our subcommittee meetings that any clearly marked spot that is currently in the city of Medford is going to be a spot that's going to be metered.

805
00:55:29,392 --> 00:55:30,813
They're not creating new spots.

806
00:55:30,873 --> 00:55:33,034
They're not taking away any that are clearly marked.

807
00:55:33,114 --> 00:55:40,559
But if you have a clearly marked spot in one of our squares or downtown districts, those are the ones that are going to be metered.

808
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:45,443
But to get them meted, they need to be identified.

809
00:55:45,463 --> 00:55:48,525
This contract says they are already identified.

810
00:55:49,333 --> 00:55:50,273
They're not identified.

811
00:55:50,313 --> 00:55:53,094
We do not have one metered spot here in the city of Medford.

812
00:55:53,414 --> 00:56:03,278
But clearly marked, if it has a sign, 15 minutes, two hours, half hour, anything that's clearly marked as a parking spot within the city of Medford is going to be metered.

813
00:56:03,298 --> 00:56:05,018
Then maybe the terminology should have been changed.

814
00:56:05,178 --> 00:56:10,000
Instead of metered spots, identified spots, identifiable spots as city of Medford spots.

815
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:12,441
You know, contracts are usually very specific.

816
00:56:13,061 --> 00:56:18,943
And it's going to be very specific because they're going to be basing their money and their profit on a lot of the specifics that are in this contract.

817
00:56:19,998 --> 00:56:33,648
And with that being said, Mr. President, I just really think that, especially with that press release that went out by the mail last week, I mean, none of us can answer the question because, you know, it can't be fact if it can't be found in the contract.

818
00:56:34,769 --> 00:56:38,291
And even by reference, anything subsequent to that could be written.

819
00:56:38,691 --> 00:56:46,897
Sure, it does say in here that the traffic commission will be the group of individuals who's going to set the fees and do whatever it has to do.

820
00:56:47,912 --> 00:56:53,754
and that the city administration basically is going to be the reviewing authority for appeals, and they're not going to do that.

821
00:56:53,774 --> 00:56:59,517
And it talks about trying to employ 50% Medford people to be part of the program and blah, blah, blah, and all of that.

822
00:57:00,137 --> 00:57:04,378
But there were certain specifics in here that are just left out there, you know?

823
00:57:04,679 --> 00:57:16,123
And maybe it would have been nice if we got all of this information before anything was signed so we could have a full-blown discussion, and taxpayers and ratepayers and business folks throughout the entire community would have had an opportunity.

824
00:57:16,996 --> 00:57:19,917
You know, this has been hanging around since 2009, Mr. President.

825
00:57:20,177 --> 00:57:23,578
This was a quick rush from September 9th to October 7th.

826
00:57:24,498 --> 00:57:30,039
And that's kind of like, you really question, what was the quick rush since you've been waiting five years to discuss this?

827
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:33,140
Even if it took another four or five or six months, who cares?

828
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:34,361
Eventually, we know it's going to come.

829
00:57:34,381 --> 00:57:40,842
Because this council asked for traffic enforcement, not revenue enhancement, traffic enforcement.

830
00:57:41,142 --> 00:57:42,163
And there is a big difference.

831
00:57:47,202 --> 00:57:47,542
Thank you.

832
00:57:47,562 --> 00:57:48,082
Councillor Langel-Kern.

833
00:57:51,443 --> 00:57:52,383
Thank you, Councillor Husso.

834
00:57:52,463 --> 00:57:59,845
I just beg to differ to a point because this council, I think all seven of us have discussed the possibility for income that is out there.

835
00:57:59,885 --> 00:58:07,586
I think each councillor has discussed how much money Somerville brings in, how much money Cambridge brings in, and how much the city of Medford is missing out on that opportunity.

836
00:58:07,606 --> 00:58:12,987
I believe I've spoke about it, Councillor Caravaglio, I mean, all of my colleagues have.

837
00:58:13,007 --> 00:58:14,308
So, we knew this was going to be

838
00:58:17,063 --> 00:58:17,584
contract.

839
00:58:17,664 --> 00:58:20,366
I mean, I don't know how to get around, how anybody can get around that.

840
00:58:20,867 --> 00:58:24,430
We'll be back to you, Councillor.

841
00:58:28,154 --> 00:58:28,834
Councillor Penta.

842
00:58:30,176 --> 00:58:32,878
Just a response back to Councillor Langel-Curran.

843
00:58:34,897 --> 00:58:41,142
You know, we never engaged in a revenue enhancement program to find out just how much money that could bring in.

844
00:58:41,962 --> 00:58:54,851
And now once folks out-of-towners realize that they're not going to be able to stay here and park here all day long, that money that you think you would be getting and generating from those folks, that's not going to exist because they're not going to come here anymore.

845
00:58:55,232 --> 00:58:59,275
So you're basically dealing with your in-town and maybe every now and then out-of-town.

846
00:59:00,055 --> 00:59:03,998
But when you think of what's going on, your water bill,

847
00:59:04,459 --> 00:59:05,180
It just goes up.

848
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:08,002
Your food tax, your gasoline tax.

849
00:59:08,103 --> 00:59:19,253
And now, this past week, if you all read the newspapers and understood that the electric company will be raising your electric rates 37% this winter for heat, for whatever that's going on.

850
00:59:20,835 --> 00:59:26,400
How much more can you keep banging away and telling the taxpayer, you gotta pay for more and more and more?

851
00:59:27,227 --> 00:59:31,252
If we had a very simple program that recognized, let's start off slow.

852
00:59:31,913 --> 00:59:33,615
Let's start with an enforcement program.

853
00:59:33,695 --> 00:59:34,936
I don't think, let me just cut this.

854
00:59:35,057 --> 00:59:39,502
I don't think anybody would argue the fact that if you want to put meters a kiosk and parking lots, that isn't it.

855
00:59:39,842 --> 00:59:41,344
It's the on street parking.

856
00:59:41,604 --> 00:59:43,246
And that's the issue that's presenting itself.

857
00:59:43,747 --> 00:59:44,448
And because of that,

858
00:59:46,074 --> 00:59:51,216
You have to realize all these other taxes and these fees that people are paying, it's just going to end.

859
00:59:51,256 --> 00:59:54,137
It's almost like looking at some of the questions that are on the ballot.

860
00:59:54,597 --> 01:00:01,259
You know, they want to force you into a forced deposit on certain bottles, and every five years it'll just go up automatically.

861
01:00:01,339 --> 01:00:05,440
I mean, how much are you going to keep telling the people you're going to have to pay for something with no question?

862
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:07,080
Same thing with the gas tax.

863
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:09,561
You're not going to be able to question it because it's just going to be automatic.

864
01:00:10,421 --> 01:00:12,502
People have a right to discuss these issues and to know

865
01:00:13,271 --> 01:00:14,552
how they have been determined.

866
01:00:14,592 --> 01:00:16,194
That's why we're the legislative body here.

867
01:00:16,894 --> 01:00:30,225
And that's why we have, and we should have had that right to make the vote, not the vote that was okay in May to make the mayor go out and negotiate, but the council should have had that final vote to say whether we're on board or not on board.

868
01:00:30,585 --> 01:00:37,791
That's where the mayor, I believe you served his authority, went forward and he took that May 20th vote as for him to go forward and do that.

869
01:00:37,871 --> 01:00:39,673
And that was not my intention for vote.

870
01:00:40,053 --> 01:00:41,134
And it was as clear as a bell.

871
01:00:41,414 --> 01:00:42,015
If you watch them,

872
01:00:42,287 --> 01:00:45,468
the minutes of the meeting of May 20th and as recorded in the minutes as well.

873
01:00:46,368 --> 01:00:54,490
The vote that was taken is similar to the trash contract and other contracts that are beyond a three-year period that needs this council's approval to negotiate.

874
01:00:54,610 --> 01:00:59,772
And the only negotiating authority under this form of government is the current sitting mayor, who happens to be Michael McGlynn.

875
01:01:00,352 --> 01:01:04,113
On the trash contract, Mr. President, with due respect, the trash contract can be signed

876
01:01:04,423 --> 01:01:05,423
by the executive authority.

877
01:01:05,443 --> 01:01:06,984
You didn't need the legislative body for that.

878
01:01:07,064 --> 01:01:13,346
It's one of the very rare contracts that can be signed like that.

879
01:01:13,606 --> 01:01:14,706
But I'm going to refresh your memory.

880
01:01:14,726 --> 01:01:21,769
You were sitting on this council when the city administration came to this council to do an extended contract.

881
01:01:21,949 --> 01:01:24,950
If it's over that threshold, you need to get the council's approval.

882
01:01:25,470 --> 01:01:26,050
Councilor Marks.

883
01:01:27,610 --> 01:01:28,551
Thank you, Mr. President.

884
01:01:30,030 --> 01:01:37,412
I don't want anyone out in the viewing audience to believe that the meters are where we're going to gain a lion's share of our revenue.

885
01:01:38,252 --> 01:01:45,854
If you look at the revenue calculations that were presented to us, ticketing will derive two-thirds of the revenue.

886
01:01:46,815 --> 01:01:49,735
So it's not the meters that are driving the revenue.

887
01:01:50,476 --> 01:01:52,336
It's the ticketing that's driving the revenue.

888
01:01:52,836 --> 01:01:55,317
And, you know, I agree with my council colleague, Councilor Penta.

889
01:01:55,677 --> 01:01:59,198
When we asked, when I say we, it was us and the Chamber of Commerce.

890
01:01:59,557 --> 01:02:07,048
and residents of this community asked for enforcement, our vision was to enforce existing signage throughout the community.

891
01:02:07,689 --> 01:02:09,892
That was the vision that was out there.

892
01:02:10,273 --> 01:02:15,060
And then eventually, if you wanted to expand the program, you know, we refer to Somerville all the time.

893
01:02:15,380 --> 01:02:21,622
Their program has been in existence for 30 years and has been tweaked and revised over 30 years.

894
01:02:22,222 --> 01:02:29,624
We're starting off with a program that they want, the administration wants to be comparable to a program that's been in existence for 30 years.

895
01:02:30,324 --> 01:02:32,725
So we're going from nothing to something.

896
01:02:33,225 --> 01:02:37,906
It's like going from zero to 50 in a matter of minutes in this community.

897
01:02:38,526 --> 01:02:41,267
And I think there lies the problem, Mr. President.

898
01:02:42,075 --> 01:02:57,344
I would ask, because I don't think a lot of people in this community are aware of the revenue calculations, that if we can get a revenue comparison, Mr. President, on right now, if you want to feed the meter, it's a dollar for an hour.

899
01:02:57,664 --> 01:02:59,946
It's 25 cents for every 15 minutes.

900
01:03:00,466 --> 01:03:07,210
If we were to lower that to 50 cents for an hour, what would the revenue projections be based on that?

901
01:03:08,873 --> 01:03:24,140
with a look at, as Mr. Pompeo mentioned, Stephen Pompeo from Pompeo Insurance and West Method, that we provide free parking citywide for the first 15 minutes or first half hour, how that impact the revenue.

902
01:03:24,704 --> 01:03:26,766
and if we can get a comparison on that.

903
01:03:27,286 --> 01:03:46,660
Because if we're looking at ticketing driving two-thirds of the revenue, then if we were to provide 15-minute free parking citywide, the first 15 minutes, so if you want to run in and get a sandwich, or if you want to run in and get the newspaper, or pay a bill at a store, whatever you might want to do would cover a lot of people the first 15 minutes.

904
01:03:47,220 --> 01:03:51,924
And in my opinion, based on the revenue calculations that I saw, that would not

905
01:03:52,997 --> 01:03:54,478
hamper revenue at all.

906
01:03:55,599 --> 01:03:58,201
And it would provide a service to everyone in this community.

907
01:03:58,441 --> 01:04:02,905
It would address the business owners throughout the community, Mr. President, that have concern with it.

908
01:04:03,345 --> 01:04:04,426
And I think it makes sense.

909
01:04:04,626 --> 01:04:20,900
So I would ask my council colleague if we can amend his paper or add this, that a revenue calculation be done to compare parking for 50 cents for one hour as opposed to $1 for one hour.

910
01:04:21,927 --> 01:04:25,329
and first 15 minutes free citywide.

911
01:04:25,869 --> 01:04:28,070
How does that impact the proposal, Mr. President?

912
01:04:28,810 --> 01:04:32,012
A cost analysis comparison, I think, would be helpful.

913
01:04:32,392 --> 01:04:42,657
And just my last point, Mr. President, you know, we all push for this, and, you know, we can be critical and so forth, and something needed to be done.

914
01:04:43,177 --> 01:04:47,339
And as I stated from the top, I'm not in support of a lot of these initiatives.

915
01:04:47,759 --> 01:04:50,100
But I think a telltale sign, Mr. President,

916
01:04:50,822 --> 01:04:57,844
A telltale sign is last week, the mayor had a State of the City speech before the Chamber of Commerce.

917
01:04:59,305 --> 01:05:12,009
And during his speech, he did not mention one word about parking enforcement, one of the biggest things to hit businesses in the last 50 years in this community.

918
01:05:13,450 --> 01:05:15,531
He did not make one mention of it.

919
01:05:15,971 --> 01:05:19,352
And that to me is a telltale sign of this administration

920
01:05:20,130 --> 01:05:24,253
And the fact that this administration, I don't even think, supports the plan, Mr. President.

921
01:05:25,014 --> 01:05:43,668
And what we're going to see when this plan finally gets implemented, and I agree with Councilor De La Russo, there's not enough notification now, there should be public hearings and so forth, that when this program eventually hits, people in this community are going to be shocked.

922
01:05:43,688 --> 01:05:45,930
They're going to be shocked, Mr. President.

923
01:05:46,450 --> 01:05:48,712
And no matter what we do for the first couple of weeks and

924
01:05:49,345 --> 01:06:00,367
give out fake tickets and so forth, people are going to be shocked because the way of life in this community, the way of doing business in this community is going to be altered, in my opinion, negatively.

925
01:06:01,507 --> 01:06:05,468
And I think this should have been addressed in a different manner, Mr. President.

926
01:06:05,828 --> 01:06:15,830
It could have been addressed in-house, and it could have been much more thoughtful to take into consideration how this community works and the way of life in this community.

927
01:06:16,210 --> 01:06:18,130
And then we could have proceeded from there, Mr. President.

928
01:06:19,966 --> 01:06:20,306
Thank you.

929
01:06:21,346 --> 01:06:24,987
On that motion, Councilor Knight.

930
01:06:26,407 --> 01:06:44,711
Mr. President, as I understand it, the motion before us right now is from Councilor Dela Russo, which would be to request that info sessions be held, as I understand it correctly, Councilor, and as well as a cost comparison be conducted regarding 15 minutes free and 50 cents for the first hour.

931
01:06:44,751 --> 01:06:45,551
Is that correct, Councilor Marks?

932
01:06:46,250 --> 01:06:50,573
compared to the dollar, no free parking.

933
01:06:51,334 --> 01:06:55,877
Mr. President, I don't have a problem with either one of these amendments to the resolution.

934
01:06:56,538 --> 01:07:13,110
I think that if in fact we were going to request the traffic and the parking commission to hold an info session relative to the parking enforcement program, that they would do such and hold meetings in each business district to make it easy for the business operators to come there, to have less of an impact on their day-to-day operations.

935
01:07:13,597 --> 01:07:17,940
and to allow everybody an opportunity to understand what's actually going to be unveiled.

936
01:07:22,304 --> 01:07:23,325
OK, on the motion.

937
01:07:25,106 --> 01:07:25,867
Councilor Penta.

938
01:07:26,667 --> 01:07:27,488
Did you want to speak, Jeannie?

939
01:07:28,389 --> 01:07:29,049
Let her go first.

940
01:07:30,130 --> 01:07:31,371
Mr. Kirby, I'll go.

941
01:07:32,111 --> 01:07:32,512
Go ahead.

942
01:07:32,532 --> 01:07:32,932
Oh, thank you.

943
01:07:33,332 --> 01:07:34,774
Hi, Jeanne Martin, 10 Cumming Street.

944
01:07:35,194 --> 01:07:41,539
I just want to reiterate that you can't look at this parking enforcement program in isolation from the greater city.

945
01:07:42,422 --> 01:07:46,286
And when you start ticketing in the residential areas that have permit parking, guess what?

946
01:07:46,727 --> 01:07:47,648
Where are those cars going to go?

947
01:07:47,668 --> 01:07:48,929
They're going to go into the next streets.

948
01:07:49,369 --> 01:07:54,615
Same thing's going to happen in the business districts, especially in West Medford.

949
01:07:54,775 --> 01:07:55,696
If you start ticketing,

950
01:07:56,630 --> 01:08:00,053
or having signs, those side streets are going to get filled up.

951
01:08:00,653 --> 01:08:02,995
In Haines Square, same thing's going to happen.

952
01:08:03,395 --> 01:08:08,659
Side streets are going to get filled up with cars, and they're going to walk down to the store because they don't want to pay or whatever.

953
01:08:09,039 --> 01:08:10,300
But I do agree with you, Mr. Marks.

954
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:12,702
I think the free 15 minutes or half an hour, that's fine.

955
01:08:13,042 --> 01:08:14,623
But it's already signed in the contract.

956
01:08:15,164 --> 01:08:17,866
So believe me, you're going to hear from the people.

957
01:08:18,766 --> 01:08:21,528
When this thing goes in, you're going to see them here.

958
01:08:21,809 --> 01:08:24,991
They will be here, and they will be talking to you about the problems.

959
01:08:25,812 --> 01:08:26,772
So you don't have to worry about that.

960
01:08:27,052 --> 01:08:39,534
But again, I just want the money from the ticketing that's going to go on in West Medford Square or Medford Square or Haines Square to go towards new signage because there's no reason why we shouldn't have regular sweeping.

961
01:08:39,834 --> 01:08:41,575
Why should we have to have cops and bullhorns?

962
01:08:42,135 --> 01:08:48,336
We should just have signs that say, you know, street sweeping twice a year, whatever, here's the time, here's the date.

963
01:08:48,696 --> 01:08:52,216
Why don't we have a uniform system for snow emergencies and whatnot?

964
01:08:52,757 --> 01:08:54,817
So I think that you can't look at it in isolation.

965
01:08:54,837 --> 01:08:55,077
Thank you.

966
01:08:55,604 --> 01:09:01,406
Thank you, and just as a reminder, Councilor Penta, earlier you brought up parking and who's gonna be shoveling.

967
01:09:01,926 --> 01:09:09,069
Designated snow emergencies, there's no on-street parking on any of these major arteries already, so that issue is moot.

968
01:09:10,289 --> 01:09:10,949
Councilor Penta.

969
01:09:13,030 --> 01:09:13,770
A few other comments.

970
01:09:14,510 --> 01:09:21,873
First of all, Councilor Knight, you just alluded to the fact that maybe having meetings in these separate district areas, I mean, the council asked for that, and again,

971
01:09:23,316 --> 01:09:24,456
plan's going to be unveiled.

972
01:09:24,577 --> 01:09:26,797
I understand the info session, but it's all after the fact.

973
01:09:26,857 --> 01:09:28,218
It would have been nice to have it ahead of time.

974
01:09:28,498 --> 01:09:34,781
And Councilman Ox, you alluded to the fact that the mayor gave his state of the art speech or whatever.

975
01:09:36,301 --> 01:09:38,902
Sponsored by the chamber, correct?

976
01:09:39,583 --> 01:09:41,603
Was the chamber, Ricks?

977
01:09:41,744 --> 01:09:43,304
I was not at that meeting.

978
01:09:43,384 --> 01:09:44,685
But it was the chamber's meeting, correct?

979
01:09:44,745 --> 01:09:45,805
It's an annual meeting.

980
01:09:45,825 --> 01:09:46,866
The annual meeting that the chamber had.

981
01:09:46,886 --> 01:09:47,506
One at a time, please.

982
01:09:47,746 --> 01:09:49,547
Councilor Carviello was asked a question.

983
01:09:49,947 --> 01:09:50,507
Vice President.

984
01:09:50,547 --> 01:09:52,428
It was an annual meeting of the chamber, yes.

985
01:09:52,999 --> 01:09:55,280
Well, I guess what appears to be now really preposterous.

986
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:56,601
I never thought of it until you just said it.

987
01:09:57,341 --> 01:10:06,845
The chamber, who allegedly had so much input into this thing, didn't even get an ounce of recognition for being part and parcel of a new program that was going to be taking place.

988
01:10:07,906 --> 01:10:10,247
I guarantee you there wasn't even a mention about the Craddock Bridge.

989
01:10:11,627 --> 01:10:12,288
I was not there.

990
01:10:12,328 --> 01:10:15,409
Well, I guarantee you, because from people that were there, there was no mention of the Craddock Bridge.

991
01:10:15,429 --> 01:10:15,849
I wasn't there.

992
01:10:15,869 --> 01:10:16,229
I can't say that.

993
01:10:16,249 --> 01:10:17,550
You know, that's the sad part about it.

994
01:10:17,750 --> 01:10:21,632
If we're going to be talking about businesses in this city and how they're going to be affected and

995
01:10:22,573 --> 01:10:31,518
and the people that are supposed to be representing them, and the leaders of those businesses, and nothing takes place that said, where are we going with all of this?

996
01:10:31,538 --> 01:10:32,618
You can have all the meetings you want.

997
01:10:32,638 --> 01:10:33,819
You can tell the mayor to do this and that.

998
01:10:34,079 --> 01:10:34,619
He signed it.

999
01:10:34,939 --> 01:10:37,120
This is the mayor's plan, lock, stock, and barrel.

1000
01:10:37,380 --> 01:10:41,703
Whether the council agreed in part or in total or 100 or 90, that's not the point.

1001
01:10:42,043 --> 01:10:50,207
This all started off as a small little revenue, strike that, a small little enforcement, an enforcement appetite to possibly

1002
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:52,240
get the people back on track.

1003
01:10:52,921 --> 01:11:02,383
Possibly, and I think it was you, Councilor Camuso, who asked the question, maybe the people coming and parking on Placeda Road from Winchester, can we charge out-of-towners more than can we charge in-towners?

1004
01:11:02,664 --> 01:11:05,584
And we waited to get an answer on that, and that would have been a great help if we could do it.

1005
01:11:06,124 --> 01:11:10,506
No, but that would be a great help if we could do it with a great disparity in the cost.

1006
01:11:10,546 --> 01:11:16,928
Maybe charge someone $500, $600 to park in Medford, rather than a Medford resident parking even the $100, and that's a bargain, too.

1007
01:11:18,824 --> 01:11:22,066
So you can go to all these little side streets and talk to the people.

1008
01:11:22,086 --> 01:11:22,566
They'll tell you.

1009
01:11:22,866 --> 01:11:24,307
They have all these cars parked in there.

1010
01:11:24,327 --> 01:11:26,268
They see people go and take the train.

1011
01:11:26,508 --> 01:11:27,648
Who goes and takes the bus?

1012
01:11:29,949 --> 01:11:35,652
If you don't have resident parking, it's still not going to work, because people are going to be still parking in those particular neighborhoods.

1013
01:11:37,233 --> 01:11:39,334
The mayor can send out all the press releases he wants.

1014
01:11:40,234 --> 01:11:41,435
Contractor doesn't have it.

1015
01:11:41,755 --> 01:11:43,436
Kiosks, what's your issues and concerns?

1016
01:11:45,797 --> 01:11:47,738
The question has been called.

1017
01:11:48,945 --> 01:11:49,945
Vice President Caravaglia.

1018
01:11:50,585 --> 01:11:51,106
Thank you, Mr. President.

1019
01:11:51,386 --> 01:11:56,007
Mr. President, we can sit here all night and go back and forth and speculate on what's in, what's not in.

1020
01:11:57,187 --> 01:12:03,409
Why don't we just have a Council of the Whole meeting with the Mayor so we can get the questions that we have answered and go from there.

1021
01:12:03,429 --> 01:12:07,350
Like I said, because everything we're talking about tonight is just speculation and guessing.

1022
01:12:09,738 --> 01:12:10,959
The Council Hall meeting isn't public.

1023
01:12:11,079 --> 01:12:13,059
All Council meetings are public meetings.

1024
01:12:13,119 --> 01:12:14,600
It is a public meeting.

1025
01:12:14,940 --> 01:12:26,003
Rather than go here and guessing what's good, what's not good, where the bargains are and that, I make a recommendation that you ask the Mayor for a Council Hall meeting to discuss this issue.

1026
01:12:28,204 --> 01:12:30,505
Council Hall, well, I would like to have a Council.

1027
01:12:33,025 --> 01:12:34,206
My resolve is Council Hall.

1028
01:12:34,246 --> 01:12:38,047
If you want to make it a public meeting, that's up to you, but I'd like to have a Council Hall with the Mayor.

1029
01:12:38,955 --> 01:12:44,217
So we, as our seven councils, can ask the questions that we have and hopefully they get resolved.

1030
01:12:44,237 --> 01:12:56,022
Then, again, I'm going to stick to my issue that I made earlier, that all revenue that's derived from this parking go toward the police station.

1031
01:12:57,483 --> 01:13:07,187
If it's going to generate the number that these people say it is, let's take that money and put it toward the police station so we don't have to wait seven years to get a station.

1032
01:13:09,357 --> 01:13:10,998
Point of information, Councilor Max.

1033
01:13:11,058 --> 01:13:20,000
That's a great suggestion, but unfortunately the mayor already allocated $250,000 back to the business districts, so your resolution is moot right now.

1034
01:13:21,941 --> 01:13:22,861
You said all revenue.

1035
01:13:23,882 --> 01:13:25,262
He already allocated money, so.

1036
01:13:26,168 --> 01:13:31,290
That's why we needed to be at the table when this took place.

1037
01:13:33,291 --> 01:13:33,872
I agree with you.

1038
01:13:33,992 --> 01:13:35,012
I'm in agreement.

1039
01:13:35,412 --> 01:13:41,515
Take that money and put it toward the police station rather than wait seven years for us to take out a bond for the police system.

1040
01:13:41,915 --> 01:13:42,815
At least pay the bonds.

1041
01:13:43,676 --> 01:13:46,237
Thank you very much, Mr. President.

1042
01:13:48,070 --> 01:13:50,631
In looking at the issue, there's a number of questions that need to be answered.

1043
01:13:50,651 --> 01:13:52,251
A number of questions should be answered.

1044
01:13:52,451 --> 01:13:54,612
And as such, we have a subcommittee structure that's in place.

1045
01:13:54,652 --> 01:13:58,873
And I think that's the appropriate area and appropriate arena for us to get these questions answered, Mr. President.

1046
01:13:59,553 --> 01:14:07,715
So, you know, I wholeheartedly support Councilor Caviello's idea to keep this in either the Committee of the Whole or the Committee on Transportation to get these questions answered.

1047
01:14:08,192 --> 01:14:11,253
Once we get the questions answered, then we'll be more informed, and then we can move forward.

1048
01:14:11,593 --> 01:14:16,173
But the underlying paper that's before us is the council's official position on paid APOC.

1049
01:14:16,613 --> 01:14:18,634
Now we have a series of amendments that have been added to that.

1050
01:14:18,674 --> 01:14:19,854
We've asked a number of questions.

1051
01:14:20,194 --> 01:14:26,995
I really think the appropriate place to ask these questions would be in committee, so that we all have the answers, and then we can all make an informed decision as to what direction we as a council want to move.

1052
01:14:29,916 --> 01:14:30,896
Then why is the paper on the table?

1053
01:14:30,916 --> 01:14:36,177
Well, if there's no direction for us to move, then why are we

1054
01:14:41,288 --> 01:14:43,830
I don't think anybody in this table is precluding them from doing that counsel.

1055
01:14:49,753 --> 01:14:50,194
Exactly.

1056
01:14:53,576 --> 01:14:54,977
Mr. Clerk, if you could read the amendment back.

1057
01:15:34,903 --> 01:15:43,227
and all revenues going forward go to the police station and refer to the committee of the whole.

1058
01:15:44,928 --> 01:15:45,889
Councilor Penta.

1059
01:15:46,169 --> 01:15:48,590
I'm going to put my resolve on there too, my commentaries.

1060
01:15:49,098 --> 01:15:52,740
Number one, I want to know who's going to be responsible for the kiosk during snowstorm.

1061
01:15:53,641 --> 01:15:54,602
Well, we might as well go through them.

1062
01:15:54,622 --> 01:15:55,822
If we're going to make these all amendments.

1063
01:15:56,083 --> 01:15:57,283
Are you making amendments?

1064
01:15:57,323 --> 01:15:58,424
Yeah, I'm making the amendments now.

1065
01:15:59,225 --> 01:16:04,068
I think these are all questions that can be answered at the Council of the Whole meeting.

1066
01:16:05,869 --> 01:16:08,411
Why don't you refer the entire paper to the Council of the Whole?

1067
01:16:08,431 --> 01:16:11,893
The contract and the amendments that were given to us in addition.

1068
01:16:11,953 --> 01:16:14,134
Rather than one question at a time.

1069
01:16:14,374 --> 01:16:15,635
Addendums, not amendments.

1070
01:16:15,715 --> 01:16:16,476
Addendums.

1071
01:16:17,296 --> 01:16:18,017
There is a difference.

1072
01:16:19,345 --> 01:16:22,447
The motion is that we defer all addendums.

1073
01:16:24,488 --> 01:16:25,929
Motion by Councillor Moxwell, approval.

1074
01:16:26,009 --> 01:16:26,649
All in favour?

1075
01:16:26,669 --> 01:16:27,730
Wait a minute.

1076
01:16:27,950 --> 01:16:28,611
One last thing.

1077
01:16:28,891 --> 01:16:29,411
One last thing.

1078
01:16:30,232 --> 01:16:39,237
If we're not referring all of that, then we refer the mayor's press release, which he identifies four specific issues that are not found in the contract.

1079
01:16:39,517 --> 01:16:40,818
How are they found in the contract?

1080
01:16:40,878 --> 01:16:43,099
How does he intend to implement these in the contract?

1081
01:16:44,590 --> 01:16:48,451
I mean, to let you know how the paper works, it gets referred to the Committee of the Whole?

1082
01:16:48,471 --> 01:16:48,671
No, no, no.

1083
01:16:48,711 --> 01:16:49,812
This is going to be part of it.

1084
01:16:50,272 --> 01:16:54,453
Right, but he won't see any of these things until you get to the Committee of the Whole.

1085
01:16:55,074 --> 01:16:55,314
No, no.

1086
01:16:56,374 --> 01:16:58,495
You're going to be sending him the request for the Committee of the Whole.

1087
01:16:58,947 --> 01:17:00,028
And also- No, no, no.

1088
01:17:00,589 --> 01:17:02,250
This council calls Committee of the Wholes.

1089
01:17:02,270 --> 01:17:03,632
The mayor doesn't call Committee of the Wholes.

1090
01:17:03,652 --> 01:17:04,092
I understand that.

1091
01:17:04,112 --> 01:17:05,594
You just sent him a request for the Committee of the Whole.

1092
01:17:08,237 --> 01:17:10,499
Yeah, but the paper itself gets referred to the committee.

1093
01:17:10,519 --> 01:17:16,265
The paper either goes, if I may, Mr.- The paper's either going to the mayor or to the Committee of the Whole.

1094
01:17:17,086 --> 01:17:18,067
Whatever the council wishes.

1095
01:17:20,035 --> 01:17:21,715
Point of clarification, Councilor Knight.

1096
01:17:21,735 --> 01:17:22,396
Point of order, rather.

1097
01:17:22,416 --> 01:17:33,979
I think it might make more sense, instead of us throwing questions at the City Clerk to have him jot down, that we set a Committee of the Whole meeting, we set a deadline for us to actually email the questions that we want answered to the City Clerk.

1098
01:17:34,019 --> 01:17:47,743
The City Clerk can put them together in a packet for us, if he's so willing, and we can send that packet to the Mayor's office, we can get the answers that we want answered, we can call the people in front of us to clarify these questions at the Committee of the Whole meeting, and then we can move forward as a body.

1099
01:17:49,164 --> 01:17:52,285
So the motion to send all papers and questions to the Committee of the Whole.

1100
01:17:53,066 --> 01:17:53,266
Yes.

1101
01:17:53,626 --> 01:17:55,046
And a roll call has been requested.

1102
01:17:55,887 --> 01:18:05,530
But on the motion to also include the mayor's October 7 press release, where he identifies four specifics recommendations.

1103
01:18:05,870 --> 01:18:09,232
Have him explain how this is part of the contract.

1104
01:18:09,432 --> 01:18:10,832
We will do that at the Committee of the Whole.

1105
01:18:10,972 --> 01:18:12,853
No, but he has to have the paper so he knows.

1106
01:18:13,273 --> 01:18:14,594
I don't have the mayor's press release.

1107
01:18:15,134 --> 01:18:15,954
Well, we'll give you a copy.

1108
01:18:18,270 --> 01:18:20,531
You want to refer the mayor's press release that he has?

1109
01:18:20,551 --> 01:18:21,612
Okay.

1110
01:18:21,632 --> 01:18:22,952
What is four recommendations?

1111
01:18:23,272 --> 01:18:23,993
Four recommendations.

1112
01:18:24,973 --> 01:18:26,034
Name and address for the record.

1113
01:18:27,254 --> 01:18:28,515
Excuse me.

1114
01:18:28,575 --> 01:18:30,396
Anthony Antonio, Yale street number 12.

1115
01:18:32,037 --> 01:18:37,479
Um, just a couple of comments on the parking enforcement program, revenue and revenue program.

1116
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:43,902
Um, I was never in favor of going out to a third party or a subcontractor to do this for the city of Medford.

1117
01:18:44,443 --> 01:18:47,384
I always felt very strongly that we were capable enough to do it here.

1118
01:18:47,990 --> 01:19:00,054
I always felt that within the city of Medford, this would have been handled with a lot of respect for the citizens and the store owners in this city and with common sense.

1119
01:19:01,394 --> 01:19:04,535
And I see that this is somewhat lacking in this particular contract.

1120
01:19:05,575 --> 01:19:11,357
I am still waiting, unless I missed it somewhere along the line, for the analysis between in-house versus

1121
01:19:12,499 --> 01:19:15,420
outside contracting as far as the cost analysis on that.

1122
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:28,963
I think that an implementation of a parking program where we're going to capitalize a particular company with equipment, and I don't mean that we're going to pay for the equipment, but it's a lot easier to get into a contract than it is to get out of a contract.

1123
01:19:29,003 --> 01:19:37,205
And if this thing is not working properly, and if this thing is not realizing the money that we think that we're going to get, how do you get out of the contract?

1124
01:19:37,885 --> 01:19:39,486
And you brought up a very good point.

1125
01:19:40,326 --> 01:19:41,106
There's been snow.

1126
01:19:42,239 --> 01:19:47,184
on curbs and on the sidewalks until end of March.

1127
01:19:48,064 --> 01:19:58,534
I can't understand how people that are handicapped, people that have elderly people like myself, you know, I mean, really, how are you going to get up and put the money in the slot, put the money in the kiosk?

1128
01:19:59,435 --> 01:20:00,355
That's an important part.

1129
01:20:00,375 --> 01:20:03,438
You've got to clean these parking lots and you've got to clean the sidewalks.

1130
01:20:03,879 --> 01:20:05,080
We need the people to do that.

1131
01:20:06,261 --> 01:20:08,423
Point of information, Vice President Caraviello.

1132
01:20:09,429 --> 01:20:21,837
Maybe this is an incentive for the city to go out there and now plow all these spots out, because obviously this company is going to say, hey, we're not making any money here, because all the spots are plowed in.

1133
01:20:21,857 --> 01:20:26,500
So maybe this is the incentive to plow the sidewalks and to plow all the parking spots out.

1134
01:20:27,041 --> 01:20:30,123
Because if there's nowhere to park, then there's not going to be any parking revenue.

1135
01:20:30,243 --> 01:20:30,663
And I agree.

1136
01:20:30,703 --> 01:20:32,324
And I just want them to become elderly.

1137
01:20:35,346 --> 01:20:36,067
I feel like it.

1138
01:20:37,006 --> 01:20:40,569
No, but I mean, I just want it to work right, and I want it to benefit everybody in the city.

1139
01:20:40,649 --> 01:20:46,954
And I want it to benefit the people that are coming into the city, to patronize the shops and the schools and whatnot.

1140
01:20:47,395 --> 01:20:51,058
But maybe, you say, maybe republic will get out there on them now to get it done.

1141
01:20:51,598 --> 01:20:52,139
Well, it should.

1142
01:20:52,159 --> 01:20:53,420
And I hope that it is done.

1143
01:20:53,860 --> 01:20:55,542
It is done, because it's an important part of it.

1144
01:20:55,782 --> 01:20:56,923
Well, good luck.

1145
01:20:56,943 --> 01:20:57,503
Thank you.

1146
01:20:57,523 --> 01:20:58,544
And I'm looking forward to a public meeting.

1147
01:20:58,564 --> 01:21:03,008
On the motion to send the entire paper to the committee of the whole, roll call has been requested.

1148
01:21:08,340 --> 01:21:09,080
Mr. President Caviello.

1149
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:09,280
Yes.

1150
01:21:09,881 --> 01:21:10,661
Councilor Dela Russa.

1151
01:21:10,681 --> 01:21:10,801
Yes.

1152
01:21:11,421 --> 01:21:11,981
Councilor Knight.

1153
01:21:12,142 --> 01:21:12,342
Yes.

1154
01:21:12,882 --> 01:21:13,462
Councilor Kern.

1155
01:21:13,482 --> 01:21:13,602
Yes.

1156
01:21:14,322 --> 01:21:14,903
Councilor Mox.

1157
01:21:15,123 --> 01:21:15,363
Yes.

1158
01:21:15,583 --> 01:21:16,023
Councilor Penta.

1159
01:21:16,043 --> 01:21:16,123
Yes.

1160
01:21:17,064 --> 01:21:17,764
President Camuso.

1161
01:21:17,824 --> 01:21:21,625
No, by a vote of six in the affirmative, one no, the paper passes.

1162
01:21:23,466 --> 01:21:30,429
Next item, 14-719, offered by Councilor Mox, be it resolved that the South Medford Neighborhood Safety Walk be discussed.

1163
01:21:30,969 --> 01:21:31,569
Councilor Mox.

1164
01:21:32,890 --> 01:21:34,030
Thank you, Mr. President.

1165
01:21:35,451 --> 01:21:37,252
Last Friday, October 17th,

1166
01:21:38,832 --> 01:21:48,679
members of the South Method residents together, better known as SMARTO, organized a public safety walk within their neighborhood.

1167
01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:57,005
I just would like to thank Jim Silva, who is the organizer slash founder of SMARTO.

1168
01:21:57,165 --> 01:22:07,853
And as we all know, behind this rail and many residents of South Method, that particular group has been instrumental in getting many initiatives from public safety,

1169
01:22:08,361 --> 01:22:16,686
to streets and sidewalks and a host of issues accomplished through togetherness and through unity.

1170
01:22:17,347 --> 01:22:24,311
And on last Friday, Mr. President, there was roughly 30 residents that showed up for the walk.

1171
01:22:24,892 --> 01:22:35,859
The walk was roughly a mile and a half through many streets in South Method, starting from the Yield Street parking lot and ending up at the Columbus School.

1172
01:22:36,910 --> 01:22:40,694
and back to the South Meffitt Business District.

1173
01:22:41,714 --> 01:22:54,205
The meeting was attended by Chief Sacco, who was instrumental and lent his expertise on many of the issues that were raised that night by residents that joined the walk.

1174
01:22:55,045 --> 01:23:04,533
We were also joined by several police officers who were assigned to the night shift in the South Meffitt neighborhood area so residents could see

1175
01:23:04,940 --> 01:23:11,203
who's actually patrolling the streets, meet them and say hi to them and see a familiar face, which was nice.

1176
01:23:12,183 --> 01:23:17,746
I attended the walk along with Councilors Caviello and Councilor De La Russo.

1177
01:23:19,346 --> 01:23:25,469
As I mentioned at the beginning, the issues that were raised were public safety in nature.

1178
01:23:26,189 --> 01:23:29,090
There were issues of concern with speeding on our streets.

1179
01:23:29,511 --> 01:23:31,071
There was issues of break-ins.

1180
01:23:31,492 --> 01:23:34,753
There were issues of different activity

1181
01:23:35,186 --> 01:23:39,988
drug activity, criminal activity taking place on our streets, Mr. President.

1182
01:23:40,888 --> 01:24:00,655
The talk also went not only to public safety, but there was issues regarding DPW, the streetlights, many streetlights that were either dim or out altogether, which was brought up before this council several weeks back to improve lighting in that particular area.

1183
01:24:01,336 --> 01:24:04,697
We witnessed a number of double poles up and down the streets.

1184
01:24:05,260 --> 01:24:09,022
that we took and wrote notes on.

1185
01:24:09,462 --> 01:24:17,566
There were also many, many tree stumps that still strewn throughout the sidewalks in South Method.

1186
01:24:18,246 --> 01:24:28,190
And again, we witnessed firsthand traversing the sidewalks with curbs that are raised higher than the sidewalk or a little lower than the sidewalk, which is a trip and hazard.

1187
01:24:28,571 --> 01:24:33,933
We witnessed streets that were in awful deplorable condition.

1188
01:24:34,711 --> 01:24:37,732
to walk on and to drive on, Mr. President.

1189
01:24:38,633 --> 01:24:48,737
And at that meeting, we took down a list of what you would refer to as a punch list of issues that needed to be addressed.

1190
01:24:48,777 --> 01:24:59,801
This is not a solve-all by any means, but a way of addressing individual needs from residents that showed up and neighborhood concerns that were in to Chief Sacco.

1191
01:25:01,282 --> 01:25:03,303
Tonight, I'd like to go through some of the punch list.

1192
01:25:04,795 --> 01:25:08,298
residents from Salt Method here that would like to also speak.

1193
01:25:09,099 --> 01:25:32,398
And in addition to the punch list, which I'm going to go through just briefly, and the residents can speak on it, I would like to personally propose, Mr. President, where this walk was such a success, and I think my colleagues would agree with me, and the neighbors would also agree, that we imitate this particular safety walk in other sections of the community.

1194
01:25:33,124 --> 01:25:38,107
And I reached out to Chief Sacco already, and he said he'd be willing to do that, Mr. President.

1195
01:25:38,908 --> 01:26:01,642
I also mentioned to Chief Sacco that it was great to have the chief there, but because the issues involved other department heads also, and I didn't want the chief to be, you know, wearing too many hats, that we also invite for these particular walkthroughs in different neighborhoods, the police chief, the DPW commissioner,

1196
01:26:02,086 --> 01:26:04,347
code enforcement, and the Board of Health.

1197
01:26:04,887 --> 01:26:08,468
I think that probably covers the gambit of issues that were raised.

1198
01:26:08,528 --> 01:26:14,910
And if anyone would like to invite anyone else, the chief so far, Sacco, said he was on board.

1199
01:26:15,790 --> 01:26:19,151
And I would like to implement these through Mr. President.

1200
01:26:19,631 --> 01:26:25,993
And the one thing I'd like to try is that the city has the reverse 911.

1201
01:26:26,593 --> 01:26:27,853
It's a great tool.

1202
01:26:28,033 --> 01:26:30,894
As we all know, we receive two or three calls a week now.

1203
01:26:31,802 --> 01:26:35,644
in notifying residents on what's going on, different things in the community.

1204
01:26:36,185 --> 01:26:48,171
And I would ask for the administration, in cooperation with this council, to set up these particular meetings, because we can use the reverse 911 to contact neighborhoods.

1205
01:26:48,852 --> 01:26:52,514
So if we wanted to, in a month from now, say we want to contact

1206
01:26:53,158 --> 01:27:05,962
the Haines Square area and do a walk-through in that particular area, it would literally take a five-minute phone call that's done by the police department to send out thousands of phone calls notifying residents.

1207
01:27:06,422 --> 01:27:11,724
I think it's probably the most effective way of reaching everyone in the community that would have an interest.

1208
01:27:12,404 --> 01:27:15,505
And I would ask, Mr. President, that we establish

1209
01:27:16,005 --> 01:27:26,292
neighborhood safety walks in every segment and every section of this community with the heads of the different departments.

1210
01:27:26,912 --> 01:27:29,574
And that be done by a reverse 911 call.

1211
01:27:30,215 --> 01:27:35,218
And if we want, we can meet with the administration to figure out a process to set this up.

1212
01:27:35,678 --> 01:27:44,144
But in my opinion, until you walk the street, until you hear from the neighbors, I mean, we all get phone calls and emails, but it's really an eye opener.

1213
01:27:44,582 --> 01:27:49,304
when you actually walk the street, and you see the different things, and you feel it.

1214
01:27:49,324 --> 01:27:51,365
You know, I don't live in the Salt Method neighborhood.

1215
01:27:52,125 --> 01:27:52,805
And you know what?

1216
01:27:53,626 --> 01:27:56,907
When you go down there and walk the streets, it's very different.

1217
01:27:57,567 --> 01:27:59,788
You know, I'm in my neighborhood a lot, and I traverse the city.

1218
01:28:00,088 --> 01:28:14,094
But until you actually get into the neighborhood, I think you feel the very foundation of what that neighborhood is all about, and hear from the residents firsthand on what their plight is, and what they're going through, and their issues

1219
01:28:14,453 --> 01:28:15,133
of concern.

1220
01:28:15,734 --> 01:28:32,185
And I heard from several residents, which is troubling, Mr. President, that night that people are looking to move out of the community because they're disappointed with the lack of response from the city when they call on an issue, because they're disappointed that nothing seems to take place.

1221
01:28:33,225 --> 01:28:35,667
And that's very troubling to me.

1222
01:28:36,427 --> 01:28:43,412
And I think it's something that we as a community have to work on and different initiatives, as Councilor Longo offered,

1223
01:28:43,847 --> 01:28:52,249
with the 3-1-1 program and other initiatives to involve the community in a direct link into the city.

1224
01:28:52,849 --> 01:28:59,211
But if you would just indulge me, Mr. President, I'd like to just walk through the list briefly.

1225
01:29:00,991 --> 01:29:12,954
And I was hoping that we, as a council, some of these might be initiatives that we can push forward, and other initiatives maybe the SMARTO group will have to follow up and follow through with.

1226
01:29:13,496 --> 01:29:21,298
But the first punch list was an issue with a curb cut at the corner of Yale and Main Street.

1227
01:29:21,838 --> 01:29:27,419
As we all know, I think we've all received phone calls from residents and so forth, and this has been an issue of contention.

1228
01:29:27,839 --> 01:29:37,462
There's trucks that are going over the curb, which is now a curb cut, an extended curb cut, I might add, and they hang out onto the sidewalk.

1229
01:29:37,842 --> 01:29:39,922
It poses a real public safety concern.

1230
01:29:40,442 --> 01:29:43,323
I'm not sure, and the chief agreed,

1231
01:29:43,837 --> 01:29:47,898
how this took place, when it took place, who approved it.

1232
01:29:48,338 --> 01:29:51,679
There seems to be no record around of this particular curb cut.

1233
01:29:52,019 --> 01:30:08,183
But the recommendation that I'm making tonight based on Smato's recommendation is that we close the curb cut at the corner of Yale and Main to prevent cars and trucks from parking next to the building.

1234
01:30:08,703 --> 01:30:10,403
So that would be the first one, Mr. President.

1235
01:30:10,923 --> 01:30:13,144
And I would hope that we as a council,

1236
01:30:13,669 --> 01:30:25,432
can send that to the traffic commission with support of the council to close off that curb cut in regards to public safety for the neighbors of that particular area.

1237
01:30:26,012 --> 01:30:35,275
The second one, well, the second one was the bollards, to install bollards on Main and Harvard Street.

1238
01:30:36,335 --> 01:30:40,956
And as we all know, that's on the other end of where the Oasis Bakery is.

1239
01:30:41,457 --> 01:30:42,757
That also has been an issue.

1240
01:30:43,437 --> 01:30:55,105
We were there last Friday night, and when we were crossing the street, some of us had to jump out of the way because there were cars coming up onto the sidewalk or backing out trying to get off the sidewalk.

1241
01:30:55,785 --> 01:30:58,107
And it really was a public safety concern.

1242
01:30:58,567 --> 01:31:11,115
So the second request, and we can send this to also the Traffic Commission and the DPW, is to install bullets at the corner of Harvard and Main next to

1243
01:31:11,621 --> 01:31:17,767
and along that corner where the Oasis Bakery is, Mr. President.

1244
01:31:19,088 --> 01:31:25,433
Another issue is in front of the Oasis, there's a bus stop that takes up several spots.

1245
01:31:26,414 --> 01:31:32,420
Many residents of the community thought it would be a great idea if we were able to move the bus stop.

1246
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:33,941
I know it's highly used.

1247
01:31:33,981 --> 01:31:36,343
Some of the residents say, you know what, we really use this.

1248
01:31:36,824 --> 01:31:38,305
And we said, we're not going to eliminate it.

1249
01:31:38,668 --> 01:31:40,249
We're just going to shift it slightly.

1250
01:31:41,170 --> 01:31:45,294
And we're going to shift it to the north corner of Harvard Street.

1251
01:31:45,634 --> 01:31:47,997
So right now, it's in front of the Oasis restaurant.

1252
01:31:48,277 --> 01:31:53,081
We're going to shift it to the north side, where the dry cleaner and the yoga establishment is.

1253
01:31:53,822 --> 01:31:59,087
And that will open up the section for delivery trucks.

1254
01:31:59,664 --> 01:32:02,986
which currently is one of the major problems in that area.

1255
01:32:03,407 --> 01:32:08,430
There's nowhere for delivery trucks to park, so they're going up onto the sidewalks, parking.

1256
01:32:08,470 --> 01:32:12,914
And we witnessed it firsthand, and the residents witness it on a daily basis.

1257
01:32:13,594 --> 01:32:21,980
And it's just a matter of time, honestly, before there's a public safety concern or a death in that area, and I hope we can prevent that, Mr. President.

1258
01:32:22,341 --> 01:32:28,225
So, my suggestion would be to move the bus stop from its current location, which would be a vote of this council,

1259
01:32:29,423 --> 01:32:38,006
of the Oasis, which is in front of Oasis, and put it on the north side of Harvard in front of the dry cleaners and the yoga place.

1260
01:32:38,807 --> 01:32:50,551
And in my opinion, that would lend itself to an area where trucks can park for delivery and also keep the bus stop in a reasonable manner.

1261
01:32:50,591 --> 01:32:55,093
It's only maybe 30 feet or 40 feet from its existing stop.

1262
01:32:55,633 --> 01:32:57,314
So I would ask that, Mr. President,

1263
01:32:58,907 --> 01:33:03,911
The next one is to designate times for the loading zones.

1264
01:33:04,631 --> 01:33:05,832
It's done in other communities.

1265
01:33:06,532 --> 01:33:14,478
If we can have maybe loading zones between the hours of whatever it might be, 9 and 10 in the morning, or pick a particular time.

1266
01:33:14,498 --> 01:33:18,941
Because now trucks are coming, as we heard from residents, they're coming at 11 o'clock at night.

1267
01:33:18,981 --> 01:33:20,722
They're coming at 6 in the morning.

1268
01:33:21,282 --> 01:33:27,827
And when you hear the beeps and the backup noises that go on when trucks back up, it's a disturbance to the neighborhood.

1269
01:33:28,261 --> 01:33:43,707
So, the neighborhood would like to designate times for a loading zone in that particular section that I just referred to, which is hopefully the new truck delivery section, Mr. President.

1270
01:33:45,028 --> 01:33:52,691
The pole five number of pole number 513 in front of Arthur's Bakery looks like it has a bird nest inside.

1271
01:33:53,491 --> 01:33:54,772
It's completely dim.

1272
01:33:55,912 --> 01:33:57,713
And as we all know, Arthur's Bakery is

1273
01:33:58,163 --> 01:34:05,809
one of the central businesses on Main Street, and that light needs to be fixed immediately in the interest of public safety.

1274
01:34:06,289 --> 01:34:15,717
So I would hope that we could send that to the head of wires, Mr. President, as a recommendation from this council to have that light fixed immediately.

1275
01:34:16,798 --> 01:34:25,985
Also, and I'm not sure if I'm pronouncing the cafe right, Daya, which is at the corner of Alexander and Main Street,

1276
01:34:27,164 --> 01:34:34,908
They own the first, I think it's four or five feet, like all the businesses there, of sidewalk in front of their establishment.

1277
01:34:35,328 --> 01:34:41,251
And they have an area which is used for eating, which I think we all agree with.

1278
01:34:41,311 --> 01:34:43,011
It's a nice addition to the area.

1279
01:34:43,051 --> 01:34:50,335
But they built a little curbing around their eatery where you would eat on the sidewalk.

1280
01:34:50,975 --> 01:34:53,636
And if you go there at night, it's a trip and hazard.

1281
01:34:54,297 --> 01:34:55,257
There's no courting.

1282
01:34:55,821 --> 01:34:56,541
off right now.

1283
01:34:56,942 --> 01:34:58,302
It's not fenced off at all.

1284
01:34:58,662 --> 01:34:59,603
It's just the curbing.

1285
01:34:59,943 --> 01:35:04,465
They may be in the process of putting that there, but that definitely needs to be looked at.

1286
01:35:04,965 --> 01:35:17,630
And as a council, maybe we can have the administration or compliance or someone send an email or a letter to this particular establishment about

1287
01:35:19,818 --> 01:35:21,880
Point of information, Councilor DelaRusso.

1288
01:35:22,120 --> 01:35:28,925
That was a result of gradation changes in the sidewalks due to the repairs on Alexander Avenue.

1289
01:35:29,045 --> 01:35:41,814
The owner of the building is aware of it and there's a plan under effect to make a remedy of that situation that was created because of the change of gradation of the sidewalk.

1290
01:35:41,874 --> 01:35:43,956
That's very important, thank you Councilor.

1291
01:35:44,576 --> 01:35:48,639
So maybe if we can get an update for the area residents on what's gonna happen

1292
01:35:49,484 --> 01:35:55,066
There must be a plan on file with the city, and that's good news that it's being reviewed.

1293
01:35:55,886 --> 01:35:59,907
Also, the sidewalk in front of LaCoste's Bakery, we stopped there.

1294
01:36:00,247 --> 01:36:06,829
It is completely crumbling and needs to be paved over in the interest of public safety.

1295
01:36:07,329 --> 01:36:12,851
The trimming of bushes and improved lighting at Tufts Park entrance is a public safety concern.

1296
01:36:14,091 --> 01:36:16,952
The bushes are overgrown and high and

1297
01:36:17,773 --> 01:36:21,376
It lends itself for a difficult area to traverse.

1298
01:36:21,856 --> 01:36:42,509
And also, when we're up at Columbus Park, the walkway at Columbus Park has period lighting, like in the square, and many of the light fixtures are tarnishing and turning yellow, and they're not letting off enough light, and it's very dark in that particular area.

1299
01:36:42,549 --> 01:36:45,951
So, I would ask, Mr. President, we have members

1300
01:36:46,478 --> 01:36:48,919
of SMARTO in the neighborhood, South Memphis neighborhood.

1301
01:36:49,459 --> 01:36:50,600
They'd like to come up and speak.

1302
01:36:51,080 --> 01:36:58,363
And again, I'd like to thank all the neighbors and Jim Silva in particular for setting this up and for organizing it, Mr. President.

1303
01:36:58,883 --> 01:37:03,165
Vice President Caraviello, and then the esteemed gentleman and young lady at the podium.

1304
01:37:03,485 --> 01:37:05,886
I'll yield to the guests first.

1305
01:37:07,187 --> 01:37:08,547
Name and address for the records, please.

1306
01:37:08,588 --> 01:37:09,008
One at a time.

1307
01:37:09,308 --> 01:37:11,629
Anita D'Antonio, 14 Yale Street.

1308
01:37:12,349 --> 01:37:13,790
Jim Silva, 115 Yale Street.

1309
01:37:15,418 --> 01:37:21,702
I'd like to thank Jim for putting this together, and the piece of paper you have tonight, the outline.

1310
01:37:22,182 --> 01:37:30,527
He organized this at the initiation, I think, originally of Anne Fretz, and then Jim took it the rest of the way.

1311
01:37:32,348 --> 01:37:33,489
I'd like to thank the chief.

1312
01:37:33,569 --> 01:37:35,110
He was terrific that evening.

1313
01:37:35,210 --> 01:37:36,430
He listened to us all.

1314
01:37:37,371 --> 01:37:40,953
City Councilors Dela Russa, Caraviello, and Marks came with us.

1315
01:37:41,013 --> 01:37:43,975
It was great cardiovascular exercise.

1316
01:37:44,880 --> 01:37:46,161
It was a wonderful evening.

1317
01:37:46,221 --> 01:37:50,584
It was just right temperature-wise, so we were able to walk and actually see.

1318
01:37:51,605 --> 01:38:11,719
I'm not going to repeat all of what Councilor Mark said because he hit all the high points, but once you do walk it, you see it, and it's much easier to understand what the problems are when you're confronted with them by experiencing it yourself, whether it's a crumbling sidewalk or cars overhanging the sidewalk.

1319
01:38:13,938 --> 01:38:14,999
was quite a success.

1320
01:38:15,059 --> 01:38:18,482
We had quite a number of people as well, so it worked out well.

1321
01:38:20,143 --> 01:38:26,928
With all of these punchless points, we haven't left the business owners out in limbo.

1322
01:38:28,049 --> 01:38:41,520
There is a flexibility to this, and when we asked for the curb closure and no cars or trucks being parked next to buildings overhanging or traversing sidewalks, our thought was to create

1323
01:38:42,510 --> 01:38:49,872
a loading zone slash delivery vehicle area expressly for the businesses who use it most frequently.

1324
01:38:51,733 --> 01:38:56,154
I understand that you can't always get provisions at the same time from a company.

1325
01:38:56,514 --> 01:38:58,434
There has to be some flexibility.

1326
01:38:58,754 --> 01:39:09,197
And if we do establish a loading zone where that bus stop was, that may lend itself to solving the problem for us, or at least ameliorating it.

1327
01:39:12,100 --> 01:39:18,725
For the owners of the businesses who are spending 8 to 10 hours there, we have the parking lot on Yale Street.

1328
01:39:20,266 --> 01:39:23,568
It was in part built for their benefit.

1329
01:39:23,848 --> 01:39:30,213
And it would be great if they took their cars, whether they're going to have a fee for it or not.

1330
01:39:30,233 --> 01:39:35,356
I don't even know whether there's a fee structure now for commercial vehicles in that public lot.

1331
01:39:35,917 --> 01:39:40,540
But to leave their cars and their vans there, keep the sidewalks clear,

1332
01:39:41,573 --> 01:39:44,054
And it's a public safety issue at the bottom of it.

1333
01:39:44,114 --> 01:39:46,576
I mean, if we can resolve that, it would be great.

1334
01:39:47,196 --> 01:40:01,484
That really is one that needs to be done, because particularly on Yale, and then again with Oasis, I mean, neither one of them should be parking where pedestrians are trying to traverse the sidewalk, and you're putting pedestrians in danger.

1335
01:40:02,805 --> 01:40:04,285
Point of information, Mr. President?

1336
01:40:04,946 --> 01:40:07,727
Point of information, Counselor DelaRusso.

1337
01:40:08,228 --> 01:40:10,729
But I say this with all due respects.

1338
01:40:11,118 --> 01:40:18,344
isn't every driveway that crosses every sidewalk interacting with the place that people walk?

1339
01:40:20,626 --> 01:40:25,230
It is, but these cars are sticking out onto the sidewalk and it's a safety issue.

1340
01:40:25,450 --> 01:40:26,231
Yes.

1341
01:40:27,072 --> 01:40:31,095
And in the case of Oasis, they're driving over handicap access.

1342
01:40:31,315 --> 01:40:37,961
I mean, we're not, it's just a matter of walking down the street after parking your car at the Yale street lot.

1343
01:40:39,110 --> 01:40:50,323
And allowing for some place on Main Street for those delivery vehicles to park rather than having them park up against the building and having to go over the sidewalk or over the handicap access or overhanging.

1344
01:40:50,363 --> 01:40:59,373
I mean, I think it's a fairly fair solution, but we're not leaving them empty handed by any means.

1345
01:41:00,598 --> 01:41:11,027
Aesthetically, having cars on the sidewalk, it's not a very nice sort of view when people are coming down the street or visiting you, and there are cars parked all over the sidewalk.

1346
01:41:11,087 --> 01:41:14,269
Oh, I'm not in favor of cars being parked on the sidewalk at all.

1347
01:41:15,030 --> 01:41:15,931
That wasn't my point.

1348
01:41:16,611 --> 01:41:23,557
Well, yeah, in the winter in particular, it's very dicey to come down Yale, toward Maine,

1349
01:41:24,223 --> 01:41:30,167
and try and make your way around vans that are hanging out into the, I mean, it would resolve that issue.

1350
01:41:30,207 --> 01:41:37,272
And maybe something nice could be put there instead, you know, some potted plants, green space, something.

1351
01:41:38,013 --> 01:41:41,335
And yet they'll still, we don't want to put them out of business by any means.

1352
01:41:41,736 --> 01:41:49,741
And I think they would be glad to have a place on main street where they can just leave the store, get in the car and deliver the takeout.

1353
01:41:50,101 --> 01:41:53,484
And by the same token, the big trucks that deliver,

1354
01:41:53,853 --> 01:42:03,116
to be able to pull up on Main Street in front of the businesses and deliver that way, whether it's Bocelli's across the street, or Oasis, or Mays.

1355
01:42:03,756 --> 01:42:04,977
Those are really the three.

1356
01:42:05,777 --> 01:42:07,317
I guess the convenience store as well.

1357
01:42:07,337 --> 01:42:10,658
But I mean, it would be in use all day long for them.

1358
01:42:10,758 --> 01:42:16,600
I wouldn't want to confine deliveries to a certain hour of the day, because that's not possible.

1359
01:42:16,660 --> 01:42:18,721
Different businesses deliver at different times.

1360
01:42:19,161 --> 01:42:22,242
But just to have it open for the businesses, if we move that bus stop,

1361
01:42:23,265 --> 01:42:28,529
And of course, the lighting, once you walk in the evening, you see all of the lights that are out.

1362
01:42:28,569 --> 01:42:29,290
It was amazing.

1363
01:42:29,330 --> 01:42:32,132
And we were going to take the poll numbers.

1364
01:42:32,712 --> 01:42:33,953
We ran out of paper.

1365
01:42:35,194 --> 01:42:39,938
If we had had the supervisor of wires there that evening, he could have maybe marked down.

1366
01:42:39,978 --> 01:42:45,042
This is where we spoke to the chief about the safety issues with regard to the recent shooting.

1367
01:42:45,582 --> 01:42:51,267
He gave us the information that he could and that he had, and people expressed their concerns.

1368
01:42:51,708 --> 01:43:01,093
But when it got to issues of lighting and the sidewalk draw and the broken side, you know, the chief, that's not his milieu, that's not his bailiwick.

1369
01:43:01,133 --> 01:43:06,857
So, it would be great to have people on board who actually handle these particular issues.

1370
01:43:07,597 --> 01:43:10,899
And the Councillor went down.

1371
01:43:11,019 --> 01:43:13,080
Point of clarification, Councillor Lungo-Kern.

1372
01:43:13,340 --> 01:43:13,701
Thank you.

1373
01:43:13,721 --> 01:43:15,942
We were just speaking about that.

1374
01:43:16,082 --> 01:43:18,163
On September 30th, the Council voted.

1375
01:43:18,263 --> 01:43:20,044
I put a resolution on for the

1376
01:43:21,908 --> 01:43:27,030
superintendent of wires to go down and look at the lighting, and he did respond to us.

1377
01:43:27,090 --> 01:43:35,133
He said, after a review of the street lighting at the intersection of Harvard and Maine, I found there were four street lights at the corners, two on Maine and two on Harvard.

1378
01:43:36,333 --> 01:43:39,434
These are owned by National Grid and are 250 watt sodium vapors and deliver 27,500 lumens.

1379
01:43:39,454 --> 01:43:39,594
He has

1380
01:43:46,155 --> 01:43:53,661
asked National Grid, and National Grid, it seems like, has agreed to change them to 400-watt sodium vapors, which deliver 50,000 lumens.

1381
01:43:53,962 --> 01:43:57,124
So Superintendent Wires is on board.

1382
01:43:57,164 --> 01:44:00,607
And that's Joe Hurley, if any other questions need to be asked by him.

1383
01:44:01,008 --> 01:44:04,110
I think, as a matter of fact, there was one that was out completely.

1384
01:44:04,230 --> 01:44:10,275
I mean, at the corner of Harvard, on the side where Arthur's Pastry is, it was really very, very dark in that area.

1385
01:44:10,435 --> 01:44:12,217
And that would be a great improvement there.

1386
01:44:13,075 --> 01:44:13,995
I think I saw you interrupt.

1387
01:44:14,075 --> 01:44:15,176
I just figured that was a good time.

1388
01:44:15,236 --> 01:44:15,376
No, no.

1389
01:44:15,396 --> 01:44:22,038
So Councilor Marks expressed all of the other issues that we noted that evening.

1390
01:44:22,058 --> 01:44:29,361
And hopefully we can proceed from here and actually get something enacted because it is frustrating.

1391
01:44:29,401 --> 01:44:34,783
It's been sometimes in some circumstances years waiting for something to be resolved.

1392
01:44:35,363 --> 01:44:38,224
And that's why we keep returning to the city council chambers.

1393
01:44:38,620 --> 01:44:41,401
instead of watching the mystery on PBS this evening.

1394
01:44:41,421 --> 01:44:45,423
So at any rate, go ahead if you'd like to.

1395
01:44:46,044 --> 01:44:52,006
I just want to thank everybody who came out, all the citizens who came to our group and Ms.

1396
01:44:52,086 --> 01:44:57,189
Motto members who continually give me information and I'm able to dispense that out to the community.

1397
01:44:57,269 --> 01:44:57,929
So thank you.

1398
01:44:58,809 --> 01:44:59,730
I'd just like to say

1399
01:45:00,362 --> 01:45:10,631
this is a mutual admiration society, but Jim really, I mean, he dispenses all this information to us, whether it's about the green line or a street closure.

1400
01:45:10,751 --> 01:45:15,535
I mean, he really is a resource and I really want to thank him for all his hard work.

1401
01:45:16,576 --> 01:45:20,219
And again, I thank all of the city councilors who came and the chief.

1402
01:45:20,279 --> 01:45:22,141
He was really terrific.

1403
01:45:22,722 --> 01:45:25,804
Really, really a very nice evening was had by all.

1404
01:45:26,485 --> 01:45:27,546
I hope we can do it again.

1405
01:45:28,385 --> 01:45:31,467
resolve these issues and find some more problems that we can resolve.

1406
01:45:32,207 --> 01:45:33,528
Thank you very much for listening.

1407
01:45:33,848 --> 01:45:37,550
Thank you, Vice President Caravello and then Councilor Knight.

1408
01:45:37,790 --> 01:45:38,090
Thank you.

1409
01:45:38,591 --> 01:45:45,074
Um, you know, I agree with Councilor Marks that, you know, this was a, this was a, a great evening for all the neighbors to come out.

1410
01:45:45,694 --> 01:45:55,159
And, uh, you know, like you said, until you get out there and walk the little side streets and all the little, uh, little parts there, you just never get to see all these small things.

1411
01:45:55,179 --> 01:45:56,180
You know, what started out,

1412
01:45:57,003 --> 01:46:04,851
as a safety walk, and they're going into a code walk, and health walk, and multiple other issues.

1413
01:46:04,871 --> 01:46:09,836
So if we do this again in another neighborhood, the council is right.

1414
01:46:10,197 --> 01:46:19,046
We have the DPW head is there, maybe Mr. Mavuso is a code officer, and other departments that this way, these people can see this firsthand.

1415
01:46:19,375 --> 01:46:22,676
What we're talking about, rather than, you know, we call on the phone, yeah, I'm going to get down there.

1416
01:46:23,096 --> 01:46:29,399
This way, they're there, they see it first hand, and there's no question about, I didn't understand what was going on there.

1417
01:46:29,419 --> 01:46:31,980
But it was a great night.

1418
01:46:32,760 --> 01:46:33,901
It wasn't that cold out.

1419
01:46:34,541 --> 01:46:38,262
And I'd like to see it done in every neighborhood in the town.

1420
01:46:39,883 --> 01:46:40,223
Thank you.

1421
01:46:40,443 --> 01:46:40,963
Counselor Knight.

1422
01:46:41,704 --> 01:46:45,085
Thank you very much, Mr. President, and I'd like to thank the

1423
01:46:45,853 --> 01:46:51,196
South Medford residents together for putting this event together, as well as Chief Sacco for being so willing to attend.

1424
01:46:51,216 --> 01:46:53,898
I think this is a great way to get things done in the community.

1425
01:46:53,938 --> 01:46:54,898
It brings people together.

1426
01:46:54,938 --> 01:47:01,042
It allows people the opportunity to meet their neighbors and meet some people in the city that they may not otherwise have the opportunity to interact with.

1427
01:47:01,923 --> 01:47:03,664
I was unable to attend, as you can tell.

1428
01:47:03,764 --> 01:47:05,785
I've been hacking pretty hard over here.

1429
01:47:05,805 --> 01:47:08,406
I was a little ill over the weekend, and I would have liked to make it.

1430
01:47:08,546 --> 01:47:09,467
And I do have a question.

1431
01:47:10,107 --> 01:47:14,210
And one of the major problems that I see is I drive through South Medford a lot of the time

1432
01:47:14,995 --> 01:47:28,921
vehicles traveling, say, down Main Street towards Alexander's, then we'll have a car double parked in front of Bocelli's, and we'll have a car trying to take a left-hand turn across the double line into slanted parking spots that are slanted the wrong way.

1433
01:47:28,961 --> 01:47:33,723
And I didn't know if this was something that was raised during the meeting or if this was a topic of concern for the residents there.

1434
01:47:34,183 --> 01:47:38,405
I understand that that's a little bit heavier of a lift than some of the things that are on this list right here.

1435
01:47:38,845 --> 01:47:41,166
I think Councilor Marks did an excellent job in

1436
01:47:41,683 --> 01:47:46,146
and making a concise and precise punch list for us to take a look at.

1437
01:47:46,606 --> 01:47:50,968
And I certainly wholeheartedly support the majority of the recommendations that have been made here.

1438
01:47:51,489 --> 01:48:07,798
So with that being said, I was wondering if someone could enlighten me a little bit relative to the parking issue and the vehicles that take the turn across Main Street into the slanted parking spots that don't really seem conducive to that type of turn across the double yellow line.

1439
01:48:13,467 --> 01:48:15,387
That is a very difficult situation over there.

1440
01:48:15,427 --> 01:48:28,112
You have the cars on the opposite side heading towards Medford Square trying to get into the parking spots on the opposite side, and it is at a different angle than just going diagonally into the spot.

1441
01:48:28,932 --> 01:48:30,092
You do have the double parking.

1442
01:48:30,112 --> 01:48:35,914
You do have the trucks, the deliveries when you have the liquor store getting whatnot.

1443
01:48:37,074 --> 01:48:38,115
They have no other place to go.

1444
01:48:39,706 --> 01:48:49,010
One of the concerns I have is when people are trying to back out of that spot where they're all head in parking, there are no mirrors that you can see.

1445
01:48:49,030 --> 01:48:53,592
They have the convex mirrors, and you can see the cars coming down the street.

1446
01:48:54,212 --> 01:49:02,575
Right now, if you're familiar with it, you know how to play the traffic off the store windows if you can see down past the Airstreet.

1447
01:49:02,595 --> 01:49:04,036
But I mean, it's a gamble.

1448
01:49:04,336 --> 01:49:04,836
It's a gamble.

1449
01:49:05,396 --> 01:49:08,818
There have been a few fender benders, but thankfully nobody's really gotten hurt there, but it is.

1450
01:49:10,983 --> 01:49:14,826
I always learned that you can't take the left turn on a double yellow line, okay?

1451
01:49:15,407 --> 01:49:17,829
So if there's an accident, I don't know who's at fault, you know?

1452
01:49:18,329 --> 01:49:26,156
But yeah, it is difficult when it double parks and when they try to take that turn because what happens is it starts to back up traffic at the intersection of Main and Harbord.

1453
01:49:26,596 --> 01:49:31,660
And then you've got people stuck in the light and the light changes and then, you know, everybody's beeping horn to it and all that.

1454
01:49:31,680 --> 01:49:37,585
But the thing would be nice if they did have some, one or two mirrors when you're backing up.

1455
01:49:37,605 --> 01:49:39,367
You can look at the mirror and see traffic coming from up,

1456
01:49:40,730 --> 01:49:42,391
down from the Princeton Street area.

1457
01:49:42,651 --> 01:49:45,012
So, but yes, that is, that is a problem.

1458
01:49:45,412 --> 01:49:49,655
That is a problem.

1459
01:49:50,635 --> 01:49:52,736
Point of information, vice president.

1460
01:49:53,196 --> 01:49:59,480
What was good was that, uh, the chief was there to see these problems happening as, as we were there.

1461
01:50:00,240 --> 01:50:03,862
Uh, he saw, he saw people parking in the, in the, in the spots that weren't there.

1462
01:50:04,102 --> 01:50:09,445
He saw cars speeding down Yale street, you know, cars parking in front of residents homes.

1463
01:50:09,485 --> 01:50:09,565
So,

1464
01:50:09,992 --> 01:50:15,257
I say these walkthroughs are good because you actually get to see the problems as they happen.

1465
01:50:16,058 --> 01:50:26,989
And I say I commend the chief because I had walked that area with the chief 10 days prior during the afternoon where we had gone in and spoken to many of the businesses about the parking issues down there also.

1466
01:50:29,712 --> 01:50:29,792
Hi.

1467
01:50:30,194 --> 01:50:32,915
Mary Briley, 106 Alexander Ave.

1468
01:50:33,055 --> 01:50:34,196
I just want to thank everybody.

1469
01:50:34,216 --> 01:50:38,898
It was really good to be out with the neighbors and get everyone together with the city officials and GSACO.

1470
01:50:39,658 --> 01:50:44,781
I just want to know, like down the end of street on Bonner Ave, crossing Mystic Ave, that's still a nightmare.

1471
01:50:45,201 --> 01:50:46,081
It's a huge nightmare.

1472
01:50:46,101 --> 01:50:47,002
The cars don't stop.

1473
01:50:47,042 --> 01:50:48,843
I mean, I cross the street every day to go to work.

1474
01:50:49,663 --> 01:50:58,407
Between the cars coming around the corner and coming out of the Dunkin' Donuts, going in and out, and then a lot of times the big trucks, which are not supposed to park on Mystic Ave,

1475
01:50:58,943 --> 01:51:04,426
the huge trucks, they just park on Mr. Gap, taking the view of the pedestrian, not to be able to see which way.

1476
01:51:04,606 --> 01:51:08,227
And then they run in to get coffee and run back out.

1477
01:51:08,307 --> 01:51:10,929
But they're not supposed to be on the... These are big trucks.

1478
01:51:11,029 --> 01:51:13,610
It has nothing to do with Dunkin' Donuts, I'm not getting them in trouble.

1479
01:51:13,650 --> 01:51:17,872
It's just people who are working, picking up coffee and going their way.

1480
01:51:19,513 --> 01:51:20,673
So you can't cross the street.

1481
01:51:20,693 --> 01:51:24,595
And then someone is like, you go this way, they tell you to go this car behind you, just

1482
01:51:25,183 --> 01:51:26,664
doesn't want to stop, and they just swirl.

1483
01:51:26,744 --> 01:51:31,005
So you really got to go stop what you're doing.

1484
01:51:31,025 --> 01:51:33,846
You can't just think one lane is going to stop, the other lane won't.

1485
01:51:33,926 --> 01:51:36,187
Because the person behind this car, you probably have seen it.

1486
01:51:36,527 --> 01:51:37,808
They just swirl out like this.

1487
01:51:38,228 --> 01:51:40,889
So that's amazing, too, that it's not an accident.

1488
01:51:40,949 --> 01:51:52,933
I know sometimes that's a hard one, because the city will say it's the state, and the state will say it's the, so maybe together, maybe the state highway and the city of Medford can get, police department can work together with something.

1489
01:51:54,003 --> 01:51:56,183
Okay, but thank you everybody for coming and it was really good.

1490
01:51:56,203 --> 01:51:59,664
It was great to be out with the neighbors and meet everybody and work together.

1491
01:51:59,824 --> 01:52:04,205
So, and I think the rest of the MedFed, it would be good for them to get out.

1492
01:52:04,565 --> 01:52:04,865
All right?

1493
01:52:04,925 --> 01:52:05,725
So, thank you.

1494
01:52:05,745 --> 01:52:07,265
Thank you.

1495
01:52:08,165 --> 01:52:11,666
On the motion, sending all these amendments.

1496
01:52:11,966 --> 01:52:13,526
Councilor Marks.

1497
01:52:13,606 --> 01:52:14,786
Just if I could, Mr. President.

1498
01:52:15,347 --> 01:52:20,707
Maybe if we can just go through them and take a vote by the council to refer them somewhere now.

1499
01:52:21,608 --> 01:52:23,668
Some of them and some of them we can decide what we want to do.

1500
01:52:24,500 --> 01:52:31,061
The curb cut closure at Yale and Maine, can we take a vote of the council to refer that to the traffic commission?

1501
01:52:32,561 --> 01:52:35,722
The chief thought that was the appropriate place for them to review it.

1502
01:52:37,302 --> 01:52:38,883
So if we could take a vote of the council.

1503
01:52:40,323 --> 01:52:41,283
To the traffic commission.

1504
01:52:41,943 --> 01:52:43,083
Send it to the traffic commission.

1505
01:52:43,463 --> 01:52:44,824
And then what other ones?

1506
01:52:45,424 --> 01:52:48,184
So we'll want to take one at a time.

1507
01:52:48,264 --> 01:52:51,805
Yale and Maine, the curb cut to the traffic commission, the bollards.

1508
01:52:52,846 --> 01:52:56,552
The bullet's installed on the corner of Main and Harvard Street.

1509
01:52:57,133 --> 01:52:58,595
Same thing, send it to the Traffic Commission.

1510
01:52:58,615 --> 01:52:59,277
Traffic Commission.

1511
01:52:59,617 --> 01:53:00,659
The bus stopped being moved.

1512
01:53:00,719 --> 01:53:07,009
We do want to refer that to... It is, but we want to get public input from businesses and residents before we move it.

1513
01:53:08,527 --> 01:53:13,268
I got to remind people too, not all members of the council could attend this meeting because it wasn't a public meeting.

1514
01:53:14,628 --> 01:53:20,290
We would have been in violation of the open meeting law if more than four members were there talking about a specific issue.

1515
01:53:21,090 --> 01:53:26,451
So in the future, I was advised that by an attorney.

1516
01:53:27,471 --> 01:53:30,532
We all met on Saturday.

1517
01:53:32,019 --> 01:53:32,279
Okay.

1518
01:53:32,499 --> 01:53:35,821
No, it was where the council actually took action on some of these items.

1519
01:53:36,282 --> 01:53:39,744
It could constitute an open meeting law if a quorum is there.

1520
01:53:39,784 --> 01:53:45,508
So in the future, we may want to post this as a public safety meeting or a meeting, and then everyone can participate.

1521
01:53:47,689 --> 01:53:49,510
Councilor, your next item.

1522
01:53:49,870 --> 01:53:58,376
So those two will be sent, the curb cut and closure yield, and the bollards at the corner of Main and Harvard Street will be sent to the Traffic Commission.

1523
01:53:58,861 --> 01:54:01,202
The merging of the bus stop, I think I agree with that.

1524
01:54:01,222 --> 01:54:04,483
Maybe we should have a committee of the whole meeting.

1525
01:54:05,003 --> 01:54:05,623
Transportation.

1526
01:54:05,843 --> 01:54:08,644
At least have one meeting that's a major moving of a stop.

1527
01:54:09,765 --> 01:54:10,485
Transportation.

1528
01:54:14,506 --> 01:54:17,827
It's always been on the council agenda, though, when people had the opportunity to come down and talk about it.

1529
01:54:18,147 --> 01:54:19,888
We got a public outcry in Medford Square.

1530
01:54:19,908 --> 01:54:21,948
You want to have a committee of the whole or transportation?

1531
01:54:22,029 --> 01:54:22,949
Whatever the council feels.

1532
01:54:24,689 --> 01:54:26,310
Point of information, Councilor DelaRusso.

1533
01:54:27,028 --> 01:54:35,713
Did we not have lengthy discussions about moving bus stops in Medford Square and be told by the MBTA that they would not do it?

1534
01:54:37,514 --> 01:54:42,156
In certain instances, the construction particularly affected the move in Medford Square.

1535
01:54:42,176 --> 01:54:43,137
We've moved other ones.

1536
01:54:43,217 --> 01:54:43,917
Yeah.

1537
01:54:43,957 --> 01:54:45,798
That was one particular circumstance.

1538
01:54:45,898 --> 01:54:48,940
So we'll move that to the Committee of the Whole of Transportation, whenever the council sees fit.

1539
01:54:49,188 --> 01:54:54,210
committee of the whole where you can invite the actual businesses that it's going to affect, because I think that's the way we did it.

1540
01:54:54,350 --> 01:54:58,492
We moved the bus stop Richdale, and there was the salon where Saibot was.

1541
01:54:58,512 --> 01:54:59,433
We did end up moving that.

1542
01:54:59,453 --> 01:55:01,994
Actually, it affects the commuters more than the business owners.

1543
01:55:02,474 --> 01:55:05,235
Commuters and the business owners, right.

1544
01:55:05,255 --> 01:55:13,279
And the particular location that's being proposed to, it's actually blocking an egress to a household which is set back behind Pallotta Oil.

1545
01:55:13,799 --> 01:55:16,020
So we definitely want to make sure the MBTA is all right with that.

1546
01:55:18,084 --> 01:55:18,744
We'll take a look.

1547
01:55:18,764 --> 01:55:20,385
We can always tweak it.

1548
01:55:20,425 --> 01:55:21,165
We can always tweak it.

1549
01:55:21,225 --> 01:55:22,546
So Committee of the Whole or Transportation?

1550
01:55:22,926 --> 01:55:23,866
Committee of the Whole would be fine.

1551
01:55:23,966 --> 01:55:24,427
Committee of the Whole.

1552
01:55:25,507 --> 01:55:26,167
The Loading Zone?

1553
01:55:29,648 --> 01:55:30,269
Traffic Commission?

1554
01:55:30,909 --> 01:55:31,629
They have to post it.

1555
01:55:31,649 --> 01:55:34,330
They're the only authority that can do that, the Loading Zone.

1556
01:55:34,470 --> 01:55:35,331
I think we should wait.

1557
01:55:35,391 --> 01:55:37,711
If we move the bus stop, then we can talk about the Loading Zone.

1558
01:55:37,912 --> 01:55:39,352
Does that sound all right?

1559
01:55:40,072 --> 01:55:40,973
Committee of the Whole discuss it.

1560
01:55:41,133 --> 01:55:42,973
If one doesn't happen, the other one's not going to happen.

1561
01:55:42,993 --> 01:55:44,434
Mr. President, if I could mention

1562
01:55:48,453 --> 01:56:01,963
In past meetings we've had with my neighbors in businesses that the chief has recommended a couple of spots, if I remember correctly, different spots for loading zones.

1563
01:56:02,644 --> 01:56:09,609
And it was he who actually shortened the length of the bus stop there to accommodate for more parking.

1564
01:56:12,171 --> 01:56:13,692
Councilor Marks, your next item.

1565
01:56:14,192 --> 01:56:17,355
Next one is poll number 513 in front of Arthur's Bakery.

1566
01:56:18,291 --> 01:56:19,851
The light is dim or out.

1567
01:56:19,951 --> 01:56:21,972
Can we refer that to the superintendent of wires?

1568
01:56:23,192 --> 01:56:25,893
Poll number 513 on main street in front of Arthur's bakery.

1569
01:56:26,793 --> 01:56:38,635
Uh, the fence at the corner of Alexander and the calf council Dela Russo was gracious enough to let us know that the city administration along with the businesses are working on some something in that area.

1570
01:56:39,055 --> 01:56:44,817
And maybe if we can just get a report back, who's ever just report back to the administration.

1571
01:56:44,997 --> 01:56:46,117
It was an OCD project.

1572
01:56:46,277 --> 01:56:46,377
OCD.

1573
01:56:46,457 --> 01:56:46,677
Okay.

1574
01:56:47,530 --> 01:56:49,610
If we can get a report back from OCD, that'd be great.

1575
01:56:49,630 --> 01:56:49,910
Thank you.

1576
01:56:49,930 --> 01:56:50,371
Counselor.

1577
01:56:51,451 --> 01:56:55,451
Um, the sidewalk crumbling at the cautious bakery, if we can refer that.

1578
01:56:56,232 --> 01:57:12,255
And also the trimming of the bushes, uh, and improved lighting at Tufts park to the DPW commissioner and, um, the lighting issue at Columbus pocket.

1579
01:57:12,295 --> 01:57:14,715
If we can refer that to the superintendent of wires,

1580
01:57:20,051 --> 01:57:39,015
And then, Mr. President, if we could take a vote on a proposal that would be in cooperation with the mayor and this council to hold these public safety walkthroughs throughout the entire community, along with the appropriate department heads, and the use of the reverse 911 to notify residents.

1581
01:57:40,416 --> 01:57:43,476
I think that would be worth its weight in gold if we could set something up like that.

1582
01:57:43,577 --> 01:57:49,418
And we'll do it as an official council meeting so that it's publicly advertised and that all members can participate.

1583
01:57:49,538 --> 01:57:49,878
Is that OK?

1584
01:57:50,362 --> 01:57:56,507
So I'd like to set that up as a separate B paper, a vote to get that proposal.

1585
01:57:57,428 --> 01:57:57,668
All right.

1586
01:57:57,688 --> 01:57:59,889
So all the amendments, one second, I'm sorry.

1587
01:58:00,210 --> 01:58:13,520
So, uh, all the amendments referred to the appropriate authorities that council marks just, um, uh, notated the B paper will be under the jurisdiction of the council to call these meetings in cooperation with the mayor in the pertinent department heads.

1588
01:58:14,441 --> 01:58:16,362
That's the B paper, right?

1589
01:58:16,763 --> 01:58:16,863
So,

1590
01:58:17,888 --> 01:58:22,350
create a proposal where the mayor works with the city council in cooperation.

1591
01:58:22,530 --> 01:58:23,771
Who's going to create this proposal?

1592
01:58:23,791 --> 01:58:25,612
Would you like to send it to a committee or a committee of the whole?

1593
01:58:25,892 --> 01:58:30,954
Well, we could do it in cooperation with the mayor so we can do a committee of the whole, however we want to handle it.

1594
01:58:30,994 --> 01:58:36,536
But, um, I think it would only work with the administration being on board also.

1595
01:58:36,857 --> 01:58:37,897
Can I make one recommendation?

1596
01:58:37,957 --> 01:58:38,297
Absolutely.

1597
01:58:38,397 --> 01:58:40,218
We have an intergovernmental affairs committee.

1598
01:58:41,159 --> 01:58:42,499
I think this is a perfect one for that.

1599
01:58:42,519 --> 01:58:44,060
That'd be fine with me.

1600
01:58:44,180 --> 01:58:45,661
And then report back to the entire council.

1601
01:58:45,701 --> 01:58:46,381
Is everyone okay with that?

1602
01:58:48,840 --> 01:58:49,881
And that's a B paper.

1603
01:58:50,722 --> 01:58:51,882
Name and address for the record, please.

1604
01:58:52,183 --> 01:58:55,325
Marie, Senate Andre, 92 Bull Street, Medford, Mass.

1605
01:58:57,446 --> 01:59:04,311
I feel a little bit disappointed because I live in south of Boston, south of Medford, and I know nothing about this gathering.

1606
01:59:04,611 --> 01:59:07,773
And I know nothing about shooting in my neighborhood.

1607
01:59:08,894 --> 01:59:14,558
That's why it's very important that we do get a call to tell us what's going on in our neighborhood.

1608
01:59:15,339 --> 01:59:16,440
I have young kids.

1609
01:59:18,064 --> 01:59:20,126
It's really sad that I didn't know about it.

1610
01:59:21,446 --> 01:59:24,348
And it's also, to me, it's very disappointing.

1611
01:59:25,629 --> 01:59:28,751
Every time I attend these meetings, I'm the only black person here.

1612
01:59:30,011 --> 01:59:31,452
There's no one.

1613
01:59:31,792 --> 01:59:37,075
I mean, it seems like no one is involved in the city enough, and it just drives me crazy.

1614
01:59:37,476 --> 01:59:39,937
There's so much issues going on in the city.

1615
01:59:40,577 --> 01:59:46,561
And to see that no one is doing anything about it, it's just so disappointing.

1616
01:59:47,508 --> 01:59:56,294
I've been here for hours, and I just don't want to sit here all night and find out if they're going to talk about the 14, 599.

1617
01:59:57,295 --> 01:59:58,215
That's why I'm here.

1618
01:59:59,276 --> 02:00:00,777
Will that be talked about?

1619
02:00:00,797 --> 02:00:00,817
14-599.

1620
02:00:01,478 --> 02:00:03,819
Hold on one second.

1621
02:00:06,221 --> 02:00:08,703
Why don't you take a seat, and we'll get back to you in one second while he looks it up.

1622
02:00:08,743 --> 02:00:09,803
We're going to take these votes.

1623
02:00:10,043 --> 02:00:10,304
OK.

1624
02:00:10,344 --> 02:00:10,804
And then we'll.

1625
02:00:11,224 --> 02:00:12,045
We'll let her speak.

1626
02:00:12,425 --> 02:00:12,545
No, no.

1627
02:00:12,565 --> 02:00:14,066
Do you want to speak more on this item?

1628
02:00:14,106 --> 02:00:14,346
No, no.

1629
02:00:14,427 --> 02:00:14,647
After.

1630
02:00:14,687 --> 02:00:16,088
She wants to speak on water and sewage.

1631
02:00:16,208 --> 02:00:16,468
Yes, I do.

1632
02:00:17,087 --> 02:00:17,367
Okay.

1633
02:00:17,647 --> 02:00:17,968
Okay.

1634
02:00:18,188 --> 02:00:18,708
Water and salt.

1635
02:00:18,748 --> 02:00:21,130
We'll bring it up if any counts.

1636
02:00:21,150 --> 02:00:21,631
14 dash salt.

1637
02:00:22,351 --> 02:00:24,393
Any more on the South Medford neighborhood meeting?

1638
02:00:32,579 --> 02:00:32,759
Ms.

1639
02:00:32,780 --> 02:00:36,102
Senate, do you have anything else at this point for the South Medford meeting?

1640
02:00:36,142 --> 02:00:41,206
And I have to say, Mr. Silva has done more public output on this particular meeting.

1641
02:00:41,306 --> 02:00:41,907
I apologize.

1642
02:00:41,927 --> 02:00:45,810
You weren't notified, but in the future it's going to be a public meeting of the city council.

1643
02:00:46,581 --> 02:00:52,243
which will be publicly advertised, but they're very welcoming if you give them your contact information.

1644
02:00:52,523 --> 02:00:55,205
And I appreciate the hard work that you all did.

1645
02:00:55,425 --> 02:00:57,446
Like I said, I just did not hear about it.

1646
02:00:58,046 --> 02:01:03,728
And for me who read newspaper a lot and get trying to be educated, not knowing.

1647
02:01:03,908 --> 02:01:08,650
So, you know, there are a lot of people in Medford, out of Medford who didn't know about this.

1648
02:01:08,850 --> 02:01:11,852
So I just want to be part of what's going on in the city.

1649
02:01:11,872 --> 02:01:12,372
Absolutely.

1650
02:01:12,972 --> 02:01:14,753
And Mr. Silva, right there.

1651
02:01:14,993 --> 02:01:15,253
I did.

1652
02:01:15,812 --> 02:01:16,812
We exchange information.

1653
02:01:16,852 --> 02:01:17,172
All right.

1654
02:01:17,792 --> 02:01:20,833
I'll tell you, I get more emails from him than everyone in the community.

1655
02:01:20,853 --> 02:01:21,373
Keep it up.

1656
02:01:21,613 --> 02:01:21,993
Keep it up.

1657
02:01:22,573 --> 02:01:23,093
Thank you, Jim.

1658
02:01:23,113 --> 02:01:23,393
OK.

1659
02:01:23,413 --> 02:01:23,653
All right.

1660
02:01:24,013 --> 02:01:27,014
And we're going to get back to you on the 14-599 in a minute.

1661
02:01:27,774 --> 02:01:32,095
On the motion, as amended, on the A paper with the amendments.

1662
02:01:32,195 --> 02:01:32,955
All those in favor?

1663
02:01:33,395 --> 02:01:33,455
Aye.

1664
02:01:34,215 --> 02:01:34,915
All those opposed?

1665
02:01:35,475 --> 02:01:36,836
The ayes have it unanimously.

1666
02:01:37,396 --> 02:01:44,377
On the B paper, for the Council Intergovernmental Affairs Committee to gather at a public meeting as a subcommittee.

1667
02:01:45,276 --> 02:01:47,158
Before the roll is called, Councillor Knight.

1668
02:01:48,599 --> 02:01:49,480
Thank you, Mr. President.

1669
02:01:49,740 --> 02:01:49,901
Ms.

1670
02:01:49,921 --> 02:02:05,235
Briley did come up and speak a little bit about the issues that she's had down at the end of Bonner and Mystic Avenue in the past, and it seems to me that some of these issues still persist, so if we could include that as part of the B paper that's going to go to the Committee on Intergovernmental Affairs, I'd be appreciative.

1671
02:02:16,987 --> 02:02:24,768
Mr. President, I appreciate Councilor Knight bringing that up on behalf of Mary, who's been very involved in that area.

1672
02:02:25,208 --> 02:02:29,589
But because it's Mystic Ave, I think we should also notify our state delegation.

1673
02:02:30,229 --> 02:02:38,171
There's been a lot of issues, as you know, in that particular area, the crosswalks unpainted, the lighting's poor, the median strip.

1674
02:02:38,191 --> 02:02:40,371
You know, there's been a lot of issues.

1675
02:02:40,411 --> 02:02:44,132
So if we can involve our state delegation in that particular area.

1676
02:02:44,452 --> 02:02:45,572
The ironic thing is this

1677
02:02:46,142 --> 02:02:50,286
the state DPW yard right on Mystic Ave over there.

1678
02:02:50,687 --> 02:02:51,848
That's the ironic thing.

1679
02:02:51,888 --> 02:02:56,192
And unfortunately we can't get things resolved next to their own yard.

1680
02:02:56,212 --> 02:02:59,395
Okay, so Mystic and Barna.

1681
02:03:01,417 --> 02:03:01,678
Okay.

1682
02:03:01,718 --> 02:03:03,079
On the B paper, all those in favor?

1683
02:03:03,339 --> 02:03:03,459
Aye.

1684
02:03:04,060 --> 02:03:04,821
All those opposed?

1685
02:03:04,841 --> 02:03:05,421
The ayes have it.

1686
02:03:06,983 --> 02:03:08,184
The next item on the agenda.

1687
02:03:08,484 --> 02:03:09,085
Mr. President.

1688
02:03:10,072 --> 02:03:14,574
May we take, uh, from the table item number 14, five 99.

1689
02:03:20,218 --> 02:03:21,678
City clerk is grabbing the paper right now.

1690
02:03:22,459 --> 02:03:24,300
Item 14 dash five nine nine.

1691
02:03:25,080 --> 02:03:27,922
This was a transfer request by the mayor for 159,340, which was passed.

1692
02:03:27,942 --> 02:03:29,162
Uh, section B $62,500 was tabled section C,

1693
02:03:39,292 --> 02:03:40,633
$55,500 was tabled.

1694
02:03:41,333 --> 02:03:47,316
And just to refresh the council's memory, this was a negotiated contract with the DPW Union.

1695
02:03:47,856 --> 02:04:01,421
Everyone has received the increase, but this was the funding portion that was out of the Water and Soil Enterprise account to fund the employees that are currently assigned to the Water Department and the Soil Department.

1696
02:04:02,082 --> 02:04:03,902
On the motion of approval, this is Water and Soil.

1697
02:04:03,922 --> 02:04:05,403
Would you like to speak before we call the roll?

1698
02:04:07,851 --> 02:04:11,552
On the motion of Councilor DelaRusso for approval, name and address for the record again.

1699
02:04:11,572 --> 02:04:15,253
Marie Sanat Andre, 92 Bull Street, Medford, Mass.

1700
02:04:16,454 --> 02:04:20,255
I'm sorry, on the motion of Councilor DelaRusso to take this off the table.

1701
02:04:20,275 --> 02:04:20,875
All those in favor?

1702
02:04:21,215 --> 02:04:21,315
Aye.

1703
02:04:21,675 --> 02:04:22,255
All those opposed?

1704
02:04:22,275 --> 02:04:22,816
The ayes have it.

1705
02:04:22,836 --> 02:04:24,496
The paper is now before us officially.

1706
02:04:26,156 --> 02:04:30,558
In a motion for approval once again by Councilor DelaRusso, name and address for the record, please.

1707
02:04:31,018 --> 02:04:34,379
Marie Sanat Andre, 92 Bull Street, Medford, Mass.

1708
02:04:37,156 --> 02:04:40,939
Before I make my speech, I would like to make sure I understand what I see here.

1709
02:04:41,479 --> 02:04:50,305
The amount of the money that is listed, is that money that's like a surplus in the water and sewer?

1710
02:04:51,426 --> 02:04:54,728
It's money that is currently in the water and sewer account.

1711
02:04:55,108 --> 02:04:56,970
So it's a profit, correct?

1712
02:04:58,551 --> 02:04:59,872
That's not all of it.

1713
02:05:00,152 --> 02:05:02,313
That's just a little bit of money.

1714
02:05:02,593 --> 02:05:06,356
And the only thing this can be used for is something that is directly

1715
02:05:06,920 --> 02:05:17,468
related to the water and the sewer in the community, whether it's improvements, infrastructure improvements, as well as paying the employees that are assigned to that division.

1716
02:05:17,929 --> 02:05:21,652
And this money, how is it become?

1717
02:05:21,732 --> 02:05:31,900
Is it something that is from the budget or is it money that we, the landlord, pay for water and sewer that they have this money left?

1718
02:05:32,100 --> 02:05:33,501
I would like to understand that.

1719
02:05:33,761 --> 02:05:34,342
It is the money.

1720
02:05:36,385 --> 02:05:39,006
It is the money that is brought in.

1721
02:05:39,707 --> 02:05:42,268
The MWRA assesses the city of Medford.

1722
02:05:43,028 --> 02:05:46,530
City of Medford then in turn sets the water rates through the Water and Sewer Commission.

1723
02:05:47,391 --> 02:05:53,394
Any money that comes in after bills are paid, it goes into this account, and right now it's in a positive.

1724
02:05:53,474 --> 02:05:54,794
So right now it's a profit.

1725
02:05:55,535 --> 02:05:58,136
Why do we have a profit in the water and sewer?

1726
02:05:58,176 --> 02:06:00,377
That means we are overpaid.

1727
02:06:00,938 --> 02:06:04,459
We are... Should I continue?

1728
02:06:04,579 --> 02:06:05,440
Everybody's talking.

1729
02:06:06,280 --> 02:06:15,711
Okay, so to me, as an accountant, when I see money left over in an account, that means we are overcharged.

1730
02:06:17,192 --> 02:06:18,834
You guys, there's a profit.

1731
02:06:19,430 --> 02:06:23,592
So if there's a profit, that means the rates are too high.

1732
02:06:23,872 --> 02:06:24,972
They need to come down.

1733
02:06:25,652 --> 02:06:34,116
And it was very upsetting when I see there's a subcommittee on October 28th, which I called to find out, well, may I attend?

1734
02:06:34,556 --> 02:06:38,538
I was told no, it was closed on October 28th meeting.

1735
02:06:38,558 --> 02:06:44,680
I called City Hall and asked, and I was told, first the person didn't know what

1736
02:06:45,110 --> 02:06:53,053
what to tell me, and then they put me on hold and came back and said, nope, it was a closed meeting, October 28th.

1737
02:06:53,433 --> 02:06:54,374
Point of information.

1738
02:06:54,394 --> 02:07:02,757
I think I was told today by one of the water commissioners that the meeting had been changed because the

1739
02:07:10,197 --> 02:07:10,837
make that move.

1740
02:07:10,877 --> 02:07:12,097
He can make that move.

1741
02:07:12,117 --> 02:07:13,778
Councillor Lungo currently is the chairwoman.

1742
02:07:14,098 --> 02:07:15,578
Yes.

1743
02:07:15,718 --> 02:07:21,859
I have this actually the notice for next week's meeting up here because I was going to talk to Clerk Finn about it.

1744
02:07:22,379 --> 02:07:24,620
It's scheduled for next week at 6 p.m.

1745
02:07:24,780 --> 02:07:29,600
but Woodcock, Chris Woodcock is one of the commissioners could not make it.

1746
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:35,501
I believe we're going to do it on the 18th of November where all the commissioners can make it and that's a public meeting.

1747
02:07:35,521 --> 02:07:36,402
That is a public meeting.

1748
02:07:37,222 --> 02:07:37,762
Absolutely.

1749
02:07:39,279 --> 02:07:40,840
The original one was a public meeting, too.

1750
02:07:41,020 --> 02:07:41,381
6 o'clock.

1751
02:07:41,401 --> 02:07:42,101
But someone gave you that.

1752
02:07:42,121 --> 02:07:42,922
Well, I was not told that.

1753
02:07:43,282 --> 02:07:43,462
All right.

1754
02:07:43,643 --> 02:07:43,903
Go ahead.

1755
02:07:43,943 --> 02:07:44,303
Continue.

1756
02:07:44,323 --> 02:07:54,992
Now, living at Medford for 15 years, I was here when the engineer said to us that our water meter was no good.

1757
02:07:55,372 --> 02:07:56,693
It needs to be replaced.

1758
02:07:57,814 --> 02:07:59,336
Therefore, your rate will go up.

1759
02:08:01,157 --> 02:08:03,239
So the water meters were replaced.

1760
02:08:04,785 --> 02:08:06,705
sold to another city.

1761
02:08:07,106 --> 02:08:10,406
Now, those water meters were not good, but they weren't thrown away.

1762
02:08:10,566 --> 02:08:17,908
They were sold to another city, raised our rates, OK, because we need new meters.

1763
02:08:19,048 --> 02:08:19,768
We paid that.

1764
02:08:20,888 --> 02:08:22,149
We get no credit.

1765
02:08:22,829 --> 02:08:24,349
Meters were not working well.

1766
02:08:24,729 --> 02:08:26,990
We're paying a lot of money for water and sewer.

1767
02:08:27,350 --> 02:08:28,470
We received no credit.

1768
02:08:28,750 --> 02:08:33,151
As a matter of fact, what they do here, if you have a balance,

1769
02:08:33,684 --> 02:08:39,768
for water and sewer in December, it is thrown into your real estate tax.

1770
02:08:40,748 --> 02:08:43,970
Wish your mortgage goes sky high.

1771
02:08:45,011 --> 02:08:50,674
Now, who voted and gave the right for the mayor or whoever to do that?

1772
02:08:51,274 --> 02:08:51,875
It wasn't me.

1773
02:08:52,175 --> 02:08:53,516
I didn't vote for something like that.

1774
02:08:54,516 --> 02:08:54,776
Okay?

1775
02:08:54,896 --> 02:09:00,540
Because what happened when your mortgage goes so high, you could lose your home if you cannot pay the mortgage.

1776
02:09:01,919 --> 02:09:08,222
Now, how is it the city has the right to move a water bill to a real estate tax?

1777
02:09:08,722 --> 02:09:09,902
That I don't understand.

1778
02:09:10,503 --> 02:09:15,365
Second of all, if you have money left—oh, I know what I'm talking about.

1779
02:09:15,965 --> 02:09:22,748
If you have money left into your account, why are they asking for a rate increase again?

1780
02:09:24,110 --> 02:09:25,371
That makes no sense to me.

1781
02:09:26,132 --> 02:09:34,940
Why am I paying $1,600 a year for water and sewer when other cities are paying $200 a year?

1782
02:09:35,981 --> 02:09:37,022
What is in our water?

1783
02:09:37,803 --> 02:09:39,204
Why am I paying so much?

1784
02:09:41,366 --> 02:09:43,268
What happened to the meter that was changed?

1785
02:09:45,170 --> 02:09:46,431
We see no difference.

1786
02:09:46,591 --> 02:09:49,852
And then they change how often we pay for water and sewer.

1787
02:09:50,172 --> 02:09:51,773
My bill remains the same.

1788
02:09:52,033 --> 02:09:52,953
There's no difference.

1789
02:09:53,094 --> 02:09:53,914
It's still high.

1790
02:09:56,415 --> 02:09:57,736
And they want more money?

1791
02:09:58,896 --> 02:10:03,678
This city, all it's about is how much can we take from the landlord?

1792
02:10:04,418 --> 02:10:05,459
And we get nothing back.

1793
02:10:06,148 --> 02:10:08,690
We get the street cleans twice a year.

1794
02:10:09,190 --> 02:10:10,611
That is ridiculous.

1795
02:10:11,171 --> 02:10:13,212
Somerville cleans this street every week.

1796
02:10:14,393 --> 02:10:16,614
And I've been talking about this since I live here.

1797
02:10:17,575 --> 02:10:19,056
I'm the one cleaning my street.

1798
02:10:19,176 --> 02:10:22,097
I'm the one cleaning my sidewalk and I'm paying taxes.

1799
02:10:22,918 --> 02:10:24,399
What do you guys do for me lately?

1800
02:10:24,639 --> 02:10:24,999
Nothing.

1801
02:10:26,220 --> 02:10:35,105
I come here and you know, it's going to continue because people are not organizing and making noise and it drives me nuts.

1802
02:10:35,750 --> 02:10:38,411
And you know, the mayor, he's smart.

1803
02:10:39,411 --> 02:10:41,832
He's controlling everyone here.

1804
02:10:42,192 --> 02:10:42,472
Why?

1805
02:10:43,073 --> 02:10:45,013
We can't watch this on TV no more.

1806
02:10:45,573 --> 02:10:46,574
We don't know what's going on.

1807
02:10:47,534 --> 02:10:48,734
We don't see these meetings.

1808
02:10:49,395 --> 02:10:52,916
I have to constantly print these out to see what's going on.

1809
02:10:54,617 --> 02:10:55,757
And I'm paying taxes.

1810
02:10:57,417 --> 02:10:58,798
These meetings are publicized on

1811
02:10:59,677 --> 02:11:01,538
Verizon and Comcast weekly.

1812
02:11:02,078 --> 02:11:04,318
I don't see it on Channel 3 no more.

1813
02:11:04,778 --> 02:11:05,739
Like I used to watch it.

1814
02:11:05,759 --> 02:11:06,739
With all due respect, Ms.

1815
02:11:06,759 --> 02:11:08,459
Sennett, it was never on Channel 3.

1816
02:11:08,679 --> 02:11:13,801
If it was on Channel 3, it was a replay of a member of Channel 3 that may have played it during their time.

1817
02:11:13,861 --> 02:11:15,841
So they still show these on TV?

1818
02:11:16,001 --> 02:11:16,461
That's correct.

1819
02:11:16,501 --> 02:11:17,462
And what channel is that?

1820
02:11:17,502 --> 02:11:21,143
It's Channel 16 on Comcast, 22 rather, it used to be 16, and 42 or 43 on Verizon.

1821
02:11:21,163 --> 02:11:21,143
22, 42?

1822
02:11:27,344 --> 02:11:29,285
It's either 42 or 43 on Verizon.

1823
02:11:30,826 --> 02:11:31,726
Comcast is channel 22.

1824
02:11:33,987 --> 02:11:41,010
So please, I'm still trying to figure why I'm paying $1,600 for water bill a year.

1825
02:11:42,211 --> 02:11:50,514
And why is it that city have the right to send my bill towards my real estate tax at the end of the year?

1826
02:11:51,375 --> 02:11:51,895
Mr. President.

1827
02:11:52,552 --> 02:11:53,573
That's OK.

1828
02:11:54,013 --> 02:11:56,735
You have a lot of questions into this resolution.

1829
02:11:57,055 --> 02:11:59,637
So let's do the first one first, OK?

1830
02:12:00,738 --> 02:12:09,404
The council resolution that's here right now is regarding salaries to be paid in part from the water and sewer account.

1831
02:12:10,285 --> 02:12:13,387
And this is allowed by law to do.

1832
02:12:14,107 --> 02:12:22,193
Now the part that I'll agree with you is that we're presently sitting on $8.4 million as a surplus in the water and sewer account.

1833
02:12:22,607 --> 02:12:28,130
that the mayor does not want to give back our program for any construction projects because it hasn't come before us.

1834
02:12:29,030 --> 02:12:30,811
Point of information, Councilor Marks.

1835
02:12:30,891 --> 02:12:34,913
Just if I could, I think Maria is here to speak about her water bill.

1836
02:12:35,013 --> 02:12:35,814
Yeah, we're going to get to that.

1837
02:12:35,854 --> 02:12:36,214
No, I know.

1838
02:12:36,314 --> 02:12:38,535
No, but I think she's here to speak about her water bill.

1839
02:12:38,955 --> 02:12:44,378
She saw the paper that was listed as unfinished business and it dealt with water and sewer.

1840
02:12:44,698 --> 02:12:47,340
But I don't think you're here to speak on that particular paper.

1841
02:12:47,700 --> 02:12:49,661
You were here to speak on why your bill is so high.

1842
02:12:50,261 --> 02:12:51,102
Let's take the vote on the paper.

1843
02:12:51,262 --> 02:12:57,966
I think you're better off taking the vote on the paper and suspending the rule so she can... I mean, you already gave your statement.

1844
02:12:58,067 --> 02:12:58,767
Good point, councillor.

1845
02:12:58,807 --> 02:13:00,208
But it's not regarding this paper.

1846
02:13:00,288 --> 02:13:01,229
It's not here regarding this paper.

1847
02:13:01,249 --> 02:13:02,289
Give us one second, Murray.

1848
02:13:02,950 --> 02:13:03,610
On the motion.

1849
02:13:03,710 --> 02:13:05,111
On the motion.

1850
02:13:05,171 --> 02:13:06,012
Let's go back to the motion.

1851
02:13:06,032 --> 02:13:11,776
The reason why this paper is laid on the table so long is because of the vote that took place by the council regarding the $600,000

1852
02:13:13,364 --> 02:13:21,848
that the council voted to take out of the budget this year, and we wanted a report back from the mayor as to how he was gonna offset the $600,000 in the budget.

1853
02:13:22,249 --> 02:13:25,991
Council voted unanimously to lay the paper on the table till we got that answer.

1854
02:13:26,311 --> 02:13:27,652
We still haven't gotten that answer.

1855
02:13:28,792 --> 02:13:31,834
So I'm gonna move that the paper lay on the table till we get that answer.

1856
02:13:32,014 --> 02:13:34,055
All right, there's a motion to lay this on the table.

1857
02:13:36,956 --> 02:13:37,637
All those in favor?

1858
02:13:37,657 --> 02:13:38,097
Aye.

1859
02:13:38,617 --> 02:13:39,318
All those opposed?

1860
02:13:39,338 --> 02:13:39,838
Aye.

1861
02:13:40,502 --> 02:13:42,323
The chair is in doubt, please call the roll.

1862
02:13:42,643 --> 02:13:43,843
Motion to lay this on the table.

1863
02:13:49,384 --> 02:13:52,345
A no vote is to keep it in front of this body this evening.

1864
02:13:52,485 --> 02:13:54,126
A yes vote will be to table it.

1865
02:13:54,146 --> 02:13:55,746
And this was for the salaries, Mr. President?

1866
02:13:55,766 --> 02:13:56,326
For the salaries.

1867
02:13:56,346 --> 02:13:56,927
For the salaries.

1868
02:13:57,627 --> 02:13:58,207
Salary only.

1869
02:13:58,627 --> 02:13:58,787
Yeah.

1870
02:13:59,227 --> 02:13:59,487
Okay.

1871
02:13:59,827 --> 02:14:01,348
Vice President Caviello.

1872
02:14:01,428 --> 02:14:01,608
No.

1873
02:14:03,008 --> 02:14:03,928
Councilor Dela Ruzzo.

1874
02:14:03,948 --> 02:14:04,089
No.

1875
02:14:04,609 --> 02:14:05,089
Councilor Knight.

1876
02:14:05,129 --> 02:14:05,169
No.

1877
02:14:05,929 --> 02:14:06,509
Councilor McKernan.

1878
02:14:06,569 --> 02:14:06,649
No.

1879
02:14:08,490 --> 02:14:09,070
Councilor Maxwell.

1880
02:14:09,130 --> 02:14:09,210
No.

1881
02:14:10,057 --> 02:14:10,577
Councilor Penta?

1882
02:14:10,617 --> 02:14:10,898
Yes.

1883
02:14:11,418 --> 02:14:12,039
President Camuso?

1884
02:14:12,259 --> 02:14:12,439
No.

1885
02:14:12,499 --> 02:14:14,941
By a vote of six nos, one yes.

1886
02:14:15,321 --> 02:14:16,682
The paper remains before us.

1887
02:14:17,082 --> 02:14:19,724
On the motion of Councilor Dela Russo for approval.

1888
02:14:20,605 --> 02:14:21,305
All those in favor?

1889
02:14:21,325 --> 02:14:21,386
Aye.

1890
02:14:22,807 --> 02:14:23,387
On the motion.

1891
02:14:23,787 --> 02:14:24,568
Councilor Penta?

1892
02:14:25,469 --> 02:14:31,693
It's kind of ironic when the council can vote seven to nothing waiting for a response to come back from the mayor and you don't get it back.

1893
02:14:32,074 --> 02:14:34,635
And this goes back to when we voted for this in June.

1894
02:14:35,096 --> 02:14:38,618
This is now October and that's number one.

1895
02:14:38,699 --> 02:14:39,199
And number two,

1896
02:14:40,066 --> 02:14:44,828
you're taking the money out of that account for which, what happened to the $600,000?

1897
02:14:45,068 --> 02:14:52,311
Are we going to get a request to make all kinds of transfers from one account to another?

1898
02:14:52,831 --> 02:14:58,493
Are we going to have like $600,000 automatically going to come from the water and sewer account to balance the budget again?

1899
02:14:59,553 --> 02:15:00,274
I think this is wrong.

1900
02:15:00,474 --> 02:15:02,575
If the council is going to take votes, you should stick to your votes.

1901
02:15:02,595 --> 02:15:06,516
You voted seven to nothing, every single one behind this rail to get a report back.

1902
02:15:07,396 --> 02:15:08,957
Point of information, Councilor Knight.

1903
02:15:12,828 --> 02:15:19,573
As I understand it, the money that would be transferred from these retained earnings would be used to fund a contract.

1904
02:15:19,914 --> 02:15:32,003
And the money that they're taking out of these retained earnings to fund this contract is an appropriate use, because it's going to be used to provide the salaries for people that work in the delivery of our water and our sewer system.

1905
02:15:34,445 --> 02:15:37,087
So with that being said, why did you vote before in June?

1906
02:15:37,793 --> 02:15:40,634
7 to nothing to lay it on the table to get a report backwards to it.

1907
02:15:40,774 --> 02:15:41,535
I'm not so sure.

1908
02:15:41,555 --> 02:15:43,676
Well, I think, I think you should go back and check it out.

1909
02:15:43,716 --> 02:15:44,196
What date was it?

1910
02:15:44,276 --> 02:15:44,696
Can you tell me?

1911
02:15:44,996 --> 02:15:46,117
Whenever we voted in June.

1912
02:15:46,317 --> 02:15:47,197
Whenever we voted in June.

1913
02:15:47,237 --> 02:15:47,337
Okay.

1914
02:15:47,637 --> 02:15:49,738
On the motion of Councilor DelaRusso for approval.

1915
02:15:50,158 --> 02:15:55,060
This does, this does require a roll call vote.

1916
02:15:55,341 --> 02:15:56,441
The clerk will call the roll.

1917
02:15:56,621 --> 02:15:57,301
John is dead.

1918
02:15:59,983 --> 02:16:00,943
The clerk will call the roll.

1919
02:16:02,043 --> 02:16:03,084
Vice President Caviello.

1920
02:16:03,104 --> 02:16:03,364
Yes.

1921
02:16:04,284 --> 02:16:05,085
Councilor DelaRusso.

1922
02:16:05,125 --> 02:16:05,265
Yes.

1923
02:16:07,071 --> 02:16:10,033
Yes.

1924
02:16:10,314 --> 02:16:10,674
Yes.

1925
02:16:11,494 --> 02:16:13,336
No.

1926
02:16:13,936 --> 02:16:14,256
Yes.

1927
02:16:14,376 --> 02:16:16,598
By a vote of six in the affirmative, one in the negative.

1928
02:16:16,858 --> 02:16:20,600
The motion passes on the motion of council marks for suspension.

1929
02:16:20,620 --> 02:16:24,063
Rule number 33 to hear the young lady at the podium.

1930
02:16:24,183 --> 02:16:25,403
All those in favor.

1931
02:16:25,544 --> 02:16:26,144
All those opposed.

1932
02:16:26,404 --> 02:16:28,405
Name and address for the record.

1933
02:16:29,226 --> 02:16:32,228
Marie, Senator Andre, 92 both street Medford mass.

1934
02:16:33,017 --> 02:16:34,218
Again, I apologize.

1935
02:16:34,638 --> 02:16:37,780
That's why I asked if I am reading this correctly.

1936
02:16:38,800 --> 02:16:41,661
I'm not a politician, so I don't know all the rules.

1937
02:16:42,322 --> 02:16:49,585
But my main reason, again, for being here is the amount of money we are paying for water and sewer in Medford.

1938
02:16:51,046 --> 02:16:52,607
I'm suffering.

1939
02:16:52,907 --> 02:16:53,827
It's really too high.

1940
02:16:57,754 --> 02:16:59,714
Point of information, Councilor De La Russo.

1941
02:16:59,894 --> 02:17:14,998
Did we not ask for a committee meeting at the last city council meeting or the council meeting before to address this specific issue with the Water and Sewer Commission?

1942
02:17:16,678 --> 02:17:17,318
That is correct.

1943
02:17:17,518 --> 02:17:24,440
Council Chairwoman Lungo Kern has a meeting scheduled that we just notified that it was requested.

1944
02:17:39,268 --> 02:17:40,648
It's Tuesday, October 28th.

1945
02:17:41,329 --> 02:17:41,749
Thank you.

1946
02:17:42,549 --> 02:17:43,549
That's canceled.

1947
02:17:45,710 --> 02:17:46,450
Councilor Penta.

1948
02:17:47,771 --> 02:17:57,913
That meeting, TR ratification is for the purposes of the new tiered system that the city is engaged on and the water rate increases as it's built into the system.

1949
02:17:58,434 --> 02:18:00,874
Now getting to your point, did you just say you were a landlord?

1950
02:18:01,054 --> 02:18:01,615
Yes, I am.

1951
02:18:01,675 --> 02:18:02,655
Is it a two family house?

1952
02:18:02,675 --> 02:18:03,235
Yes, it is.

1953
02:18:03,395 --> 02:18:03,635
Okay.

1954
02:18:03,655 --> 02:18:06,656
You should be getting at least six bills a year from the city.

1955
02:18:07,670 --> 02:18:14,855
And if you're getting six bills a year, and if you're only paying $1,600, not only, you're paying $1,600.

1956
02:18:14,895 --> 02:18:16,196
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.

1957
02:18:16,476 --> 02:18:22,461
If you're paying $1,600, and they're attaching that to your, you said they're attaching that to your real estate bill?

1958
02:18:22,921 --> 02:18:27,104
If I have the balance, if I can't pay it, they send it to my real estate tax.

1959
02:18:27,464 --> 02:18:32,188
So are you saying that the very last water bill you got was for $1,600, or is this an accumulation?

1960
02:18:32,208 --> 02:18:32,768
Accumulation.

1961
02:18:33,360 --> 02:18:34,400
Oh, it's an accumulation.

1962
02:18:34,580 --> 02:18:34,820
Right.

1963
02:18:35,420 --> 02:18:41,121
But that's $1,600 a year for water and sewer, where other cities are paying $200 something for the year.

1964
02:18:41,562 --> 02:18:42,722
I know, but that's.

1965
02:18:44,402 --> 02:18:45,202
You understand what I'm saying?

1966
02:18:45,222 --> 02:18:46,483
Yeah, how many kids do you have in your house?

1967
02:18:47,183 --> 02:18:47,463
Me?

1968
02:18:47,523 --> 02:18:48,463
Yeah.

1969
02:18:48,683 --> 02:18:48,803
One.

1970
02:18:49,043 --> 02:18:50,443
She's about to go to college.

1971
02:18:50,463 --> 02:18:51,343
And what about your tenant?

1972
02:18:51,683 --> 02:18:51,924
Two.

1973
02:18:52,324 --> 02:18:53,024
Two, OK.

1974
02:18:53,384 --> 02:18:59,565
So what's going to happen is, I don't know if you'll get your particular resolution resolved,

1975
02:19:00,205 --> 02:19:02,668
You'd be better going to the Water and Soil Commission meeting.

1976
02:19:02,708 --> 02:19:14,562
They meet in the afternoon once a month, and just explain to them that if you have a problem paying your bill because it's too much, you can go into a payment agreement downstairs in the Treasurer-Collector's office, and they will be able to do that.

1977
02:19:14,842 --> 02:19:19,487
But if you just keep going and not paying for your bill, they will put that attachment on there.

1978
02:19:19,828 --> 02:19:20,869
And who gives them that right?

1979
02:19:21,343 --> 02:19:21,683
Pardon me?

1980
02:19:21,883 --> 02:19:22,844
Who gave them that right?

1981
02:19:23,685 --> 02:19:24,045
Oh, they do.

1982
02:19:24,065 --> 02:19:24,906
You have to pay your bill.

1983
02:19:25,226 --> 02:19:26,127
I understand.

1984
02:19:26,147 --> 02:19:27,028
I have to pay my bill.

1985
02:19:27,128 --> 02:19:30,851
But who gave the city the right to put it on my real estate tax?

1986
02:19:32,252 --> 02:19:34,895
State law allows them to put it onto your tax bill.

1987
02:19:35,535 --> 02:19:37,297
I don't think it's happening elsewhere.

1988
02:19:37,317 --> 02:19:38,838
It's Massachusetts state law.

1989
02:19:39,178 --> 02:19:40,199
That they can't do that?

1990
02:19:40,339 --> 02:19:40,559
Yes.

1991
02:19:41,080 --> 02:19:46,885
If you contact Fred Pompeo in the Treasurer's Assessor's Office, he'll refer to the site section of the law.

1992
02:19:47,565 --> 02:19:49,247
The best way to avoid this is to pay the bill.

1993
02:19:49,753 --> 02:19:50,954
if you can afford it when it comes.

1994
02:19:51,194 --> 02:19:58,060
Otherwise, I don't have a problem paying my bill when the board cannot explain to me how they come with the rates.

1995
02:19:58,941 --> 02:19:59,321
I don't care.

1996
02:19:59,341 --> 02:19:59,862
You could work.

1997
02:19:59,882 --> 02:20:01,003
I work at MIT.

1998
02:20:01,183 --> 02:20:06,067
I could bring a mathematician here and they would not understand how the heck they come with the rates.

1999
02:20:06,708 --> 02:20:06,928
Okay.

2000
02:20:07,618 --> 02:20:09,279
Those rates make no sense.

2001
02:20:09,539 --> 02:20:15,381
And for them to have so much money, 1.8 million, and then they're going to- No, no, no.

2002
02:20:15,401 --> 02:20:15,801
8.4 million.

2003
02:20:15,821 --> 02:20:18,342
Oh, you see, you guys are making it worse.

2004
02:20:19,342 --> 02:20:22,763
They have so much money and they want to raise our rates again?

2005
02:20:22,923 --> 02:20:23,604
Well, that's the mayor.

2006
02:20:23,624 --> 02:20:25,744
This is the mayor's proposal, not the council.

2007
02:20:26,144 --> 02:20:27,325
This is the mayor raising the rates.

2008
02:20:28,520 --> 02:20:30,141
part of the new DPW yard.

2009
02:20:30,161 --> 02:20:30,861
So why do I vote?

2010
02:20:31,041 --> 02:20:33,042
Tell me, can you please tell me why I vote?

2011
02:20:33,062 --> 02:20:33,322
Marie.

2012
02:20:33,822 --> 02:20:34,503
Why do I vote?

2013
02:20:34,543 --> 02:20:38,705
Miss Senate, part of the new DPW yard is being funded through this.

2014
02:20:38,885 --> 02:20:39,845
Wait a minute, slow down.

2015
02:20:39,865 --> 02:20:40,466
That is not true.

2016
02:20:40,506 --> 02:20:42,266
We have nothing in front of us that says that.

2017
02:20:42,346 --> 02:20:45,188
We haven't yet, but we were told all along, Councilor Penta.

2018
02:20:45,208 --> 02:20:45,968
Yeah, but we don't have it.

2019
02:20:46,008 --> 02:20:47,369
It's just existing.

2020
02:20:47,449 --> 02:20:47,849
Existing.

2021
02:20:48,489 --> 02:20:48,649
Yes.

2022
02:20:48,669 --> 02:20:51,070
No, no, no, no, exactly.

2023
02:20:51,090 --> 02:20:56,373
I'm not talking about the rates, but we did all along know that the DPW yard was in part being funded by the water and sewer accounts.

2024
02:20:58,580 --> 02:20:59,401
Councilor Knight.

2025
02:21:01,702 --> 02:21:06,665
In taking a look at the records for paper 14-599, no roll call vote was taken.

2026
02:21:08,606 --> 02:21:09,547
You get that, Councilor Penta?

2027
02:21:10,327 --> 02:21:14,410
Listen, all I know is in that night, seven members of council agreed, because you laid the paper on the table.

2028
02:21:15,370 --> 02:21:17,291
How do you lay the paper on the table without taking a vote?

2029
02:21:19,513 --> 02:21:19,853
The ayes have it.

2030
02:21:19,933 --> 02:21:20,353
Continue.

2031
02:21:20,373 --> 02:21:22,635
I don't know where to go.

2032
02:21:22,655 --> 02:21:24,175
I think you should go back and watch the tape.

2033
02:21:24,195 --> 02:21:25,897
You were talking about the mathematician.

2034
02:21:25,937 --> 02:21:27,277
This is unbelievable.

2035
02:21:27,558 --> 02:21:28,078
Mr. President?

2036
02:21:29,253 --> 02:21:29,854
You all set?

2037
02:21:32,497 --> 02:21:33,898
Is there a choice, really?

2038
02:21:34,018 --> 02:21:34,398
No, no, no.

2039
02:21:34,438 --> 02:21:35,780
You can have the floor, Councillor Marks.

2040
02:21:36,080 --> 02:21:37,682
She wants to know when the next meeting will be.

2041
02:21:37,822 --> 02:21:38,883
The next meeting will be?

2042
02:21:39,023 --> 02:21:39,924
November 18th.

2043
02:21:41,646 --> 02:21:49,153
Hopefully, if nothing's scheduled, Clerk Finn, November 18th at 6 p.m., room 207, which is right next door to this room.

2044
02:21:49,734 --> 02:21:50,615
The public's welcome.

2045
02:21:51,582 --> 02:21:55,144
We're going to discuss the water rate increases, because we agree with you.

2046
02:21:55,164 --> 02:21:59,966
And then new tiered system, I guess we can add to that.

2047
02:22:01,546 --> 02:22:02,207
And what time is that, 6?

2048
02:22:02,747 --> 02:22:03,067
6 PM.

2049
02:22:03,087 --> 02:22:03,807
6 PM.

2050
02:22:08,589 --> 02:22:09,950
Point of information, Councilor Knight.

2051
02:22:11,010 --> 02:22:11,151
Ms.

2052
02:22:11,211 --> 02:22:14,412
Andre, I do also believe that the Water Commission does meet monthly.

2053
02:22:15,200 --> 02:22:20,784
I don't have that information in front of me right now as to when the Water Commission will meet again, but I know it's posted on the city's website.

2054
02:22:21,125 --> 02:22:25,268
They used to meet in the morning where I would have to leave work or be late for work.

2055
02:22:25,288 --> 02:22:26,329
It's in the afternoon now.

2056
02:22:26,369 --> 02:22:27,369
I think it's in the afternoon now.

2057
02:22:27,409 --> 02:22:30,592
Now they changed it to the afternoon because a lot of people used to complain.

2058
02:22:31,106 --> 02:22:33,969
But afternoon, I still have to leave work because I work.

2059
02:22:34,369 --> 02:22:35,711
I don't work in the afternoon only.

2060
02:22:35,731 --> 02:22:36,892
I'm in the same shipyard, believe me.

2061
02:22:36,912 --> 02:22:37,152
Right.

2062
02:22:37,513 --> 02:22:40,316
So they make it very difficult.

2063
02:22:40,816 --> 02:22:46,182
And I know that's how what I used to know is the board was elected by the mayor.

2064
02:22:46,562 --> 02:22:49,785
It seems like everything is done by the mayor.

2065
02:22:49,805 --> 02:22:53,029
And I don't know how the city is

2066
02:22:53,670 --> 02:22:53,970
run.

2067
02:22:54,210 --> 02:22:55,511
It makes no sense to me.

2068
02:22:56,391 --> 02:22:59,272
I feel seriously, if I could move, I would move.

2069
02:22:59,512 --> 02:23:02,973
I'm so disappointed, so disgusted with the way the city runs.

2070
02:23:03,133 --> 02:23:03,654
I'm sorry.

2071
02:23:03,714 --> 02:23:04,814
That's how I feel right now.

2072
02:23:05,354 --> 02:23:08,375
I don't get anything for buying a house here.

2073
02:23:09,556 --> 02:23:10,596
Everything is going up.

2074
02:23:11,764 --> 02:23:12,884
Everything costs more money.

2075
02:23:13,405 --> 02:23:20,327
And no, it's not that I don't want to pay my bill, but why am I paying water and sewer?

2076
02:23:20,347 --> 02:23:21,307
$1,600, $1,800 a year for water?

2077
02:23:22,127 --> 02:23:22,827
Makes no sense.

2078
02:23:22,947 --> 02:23:26,509
I have one kid in the house, and she's in high school, going to college.

2079
02:23:27,669 --> 02:23:28,929
I don't have a lot of people in my house.

2080
02:23:29,109 --> 02:23:29,810
I work all day.

2081
02:23:31,650 --> 02:23:32,851
And my tenants work all day.

2082
02:23:33,091 --> 02:23:33,651
They're grown.

2083
02:23:33,671 --> 02:23:34,351
They're not kids.

2084
02:23:35,311 --> 02:23:36,072
So it makes no sense.

2085
02:23:36,092 --> 02:23:37,312
How many people are in the tenants unit?

2086
02:23:37,372 --> 02:23:37,652
Two.

2087
02:23:37,992 --> 02:23:38,452
Two, OK.

2088
02:23:39,233 --> 02:23:40,113
So four people, $1,600 a year.

2089
02:23:40,133 --> 02:23:40,373
That's it.

2090
02:23:41,286 --> 02:23:41,706
That's it.

2091
02:23:42,167 --> 02:23:43,087
That makes no sense.

2092
02:23:43,968 --> 02:23:45,309
It just makes no sense to me.

2093
02:23:46,070 --> 02:23:47,931
And I don't know.

2094
02:23:48,331 --> 02:23:49,712
I'm just fed up.

2095
02:23:50,213 --> 02:23:58,819
And that's why people, I feel that the counselors, you guys try, but there's no power.

2096
02:23:59,379 --> 02:23:59,820
I'm sorry.

2097
02:23:59,860 --> 02:24:00,540
That's how I feel.

2098
02:24:00,600 --> 02:24:01,501
And I've said it before.

2099
02:24:01,981 --> 02:24:10,688
And I, I take my voting seriously and I go and I vote and then I come here, I state my case and you guys listen to me.

2100
02:24:11,138 --> 02:24:13,940
You try to get the mayor to attend meetings, he doesn't show up.

2101
02:24:15,461 --> 02:24:16,221
What does that leave me?

2102
02:24:18,022 --> 02:24:19,203
I'm just disappointed.

2103
02:24:19,223 --> 02:24:19,623
Thank you.

2104
02:24:19,923 --> 02:24:21,504
Councilor Knight, you all set?

2105
02:24:21,784 --> 02:24:22,705
Yes, thank you, Mr. President.

2106
02:24:22,945 --> 02:24:23,565
Councilor Marks.

2107
02:24:24,566 --> 02:24:25,606
Thank you, Mr. President.

2108
02:24:25,746 --> 02:24:36,713
And Marie, if I could, I know you, I remember it has to be eight years ago that you came before the council.

2109
02:24:37,572 --> 02:24:45,033
And at the time, uh, I believe it was right around when we were changing the meters and, um, you had a giant water bill that you got.

2110
02:24:45,053 --> 02:24:49,374
Um, and you disputed it, I believe at the time with the water and sewer commissioners.

2111
02:24:50,274 --> 02:24:53,895
And, um, I believe they replaced your meter back then.

2112
02:24:53,955 --> 02:24:55,395
Was that my meter?

2113
02:24:55,435 --> 02:24:56,536
My meter was fine.

2114
02:24:56,716 --> 02:25:02,777
And then I guess they finally gave me some credit, but

2115
02:25:04,597 --> 02:25:08,302
As I stated to you, I remember you were still a counselor.

2116
02:25:08,682 --> 02:25:12,728
I could have lost my home because my mortgage went way up.

2117
02:25:13,666 --> 02:25:20,568
I mean, you add $1,600 into someone, and they keep it for the whole year, the new rate of your mortgage.

2118
02:25:20,608 --> 02:25:22,768
They don't just add it for a few months.

2119
02:25:23,168 --> 02:25:27,029
So that whole year, I had to pay more money on my mortgage.

2120
02:25:27,650 --> 02:25:30,570
And then they gave me a credit, which didn't mean any, you know what I mean?

2121
02:25:30,850 --> 02:25:31,450
I understand that.

2122
02:25:31,470 --> 02:25:35,992
But at the beginning, you questioned why we bought new meters as a city.

2123
02:25:36,152 --> 02:25:36,752
Yes, I did.

2124
02:25:37,352 --> 02:25:41,253
And if I could just state to you that back some 10 years ago,

2125
02:25:41,918 --> 02:25:47,123
roughly half the meters in the community were being estimated because they were malfunctioning.

2126
02:25:47,903 --> 02:25:55,751
So when you estimate a meeting, it's someone at city hall saying, I believe based on what I'm looking at, that they consumed this amount of water.

2127
02:25:56,431 --> 02:25:58,453
Now I, as a rate payer and a taxpayer,

2128
02:25:58,958 --> 02:26:00,639
I don't want someone estimating my bill.

2129
02:26:00,679 --> 02:26:02,820
I want actual usage.

2130
02:26:03,320 --> 02:26:12,045
So we as a community knew that we had a problem with these meters that were 25 and 30 years old because they were the meters that were installed in our homes.

2131
02:26:12,665 --> 02:26:16,467
Thought it was best to move forward with meters that would be accurate.

2132
02:26:16,827 --> 02:26:19,529
So if you use X number, you pay for X number.

2133
02:26:19,769 --> 02:26:21,650
There's no if, ands or buts about it.

2134
02:26:21,993 --> 02:26:22,674
That's what you pay.

2135
02:26:23,074 --> 02:26:29,299
So that's why the city had to move forward because we were estimating more than half the residents of this community that water bill.

2136
02:26:29,639 --> 02:26:31,400
And in my opinion, that was unfair.

2137
02:26:32,041 --> 02:26:37,505
The second point is that this council has been pushing for an outside meter.

2138
02:26:37,785 --> 02:26:40,987
So when you water your lawn, you don't have to pay a sewer cost.

2139
02:26:41,648 --> 02:26:43,750
Uh, when you wash your car, you don't have to pay a sewer cost.

2140
02:26:44,150 --> 02:26:46,472
And that was implemented back a few years ago.

2141
02:26:47,072 --> 02:26:50,875
We also, which we're going to meet under council longer current shortly,

2142
02:26:51,432 --> 02:26:54,213
is we're going to create a new tiered system in the community.

2143
02:26:54,733 --> 02:26:59,415
So you're going to pay not the one water and sewer rate that you currently pay now.

2144
02:26:59,915 --> 02:27:04,196
So you pay the same water rate that Tufts University pays.

2145
02:27:05,357 --> 02:27:07,998
You pay the same rate that the Budweiser plant pays.

2146
02:27:08,158 --> 02:27:09,578
Not the same bill, the same rate.

2147
02:27:10,318 --> 02:27:13,620
And what we said is it should be based on your consumption.

2148
02:27:14,020 --> 02:27:19,622
So if you're a high end user, you should pay more because you're taxing the system, you're using the system more.

2149
02:27:19,842 --> 02:27:20,922
You should pay a higher rate.

2150
02:27:21,393 --> 02:27:23,475
So the mayor hired a consultant.

2151
02:27:23,495 --> 02:27:25,256
He sat down with the Water and Sewer Commissioners.

2152
02:27:25,576 --> 02:27:30,920
He's been meeting off and on with the council, giving us some, how the project's going to work.

2153
02:27:31,340 --> 02:27:34,462
And we're going to meet finally on this within the next couple of weeks.

2154
02:27:34,943 --> 02:27:38,886
But what that's going to do is it's going to allow someone to conserve.

2155
02:27:39,466 --> 02:27:44,850
So if your issue is that your bill is too high and you're paying too much, we know your meter's probably accurate now.

2156
02:27:44,910 --> 02:27:47,672
It's a new meter, and it's, you know, quite frankly, it's probably accurate.

2157
02:27:48,255 --> 02:27:53,677
You'll be able to have a direct impact on lowering your bill by doing whatever you can to conserve.

2158
02:27:54,418 --> 02:27:56,118
That has never happened, really, in the past.

2159
02:27:56,939 --> 02:27:58,480
And your rate will be based on that.

2160
02:27:58,780 --> 02:28:01,841
So you'll end up paying a lower rate than you currently pay.

2161
02:28:02,221 --> 02:28:03,282
You may have a savings.

2162
02:28:03,942 --> 02:28:08,004
And just if I could, Mr. President, because you brought up so many valid points, I agree.

2163
02:28:08,044 --> 02:28:10,765
The $8.4 million, that's a surplus.

2164
02:28:10,925 --> 02:28:11,585
It's excessive.

2165
02:28:12,046 --> 02:28:15,827
Members of this council have asked to offset the rates.

2166
02:28:16,508 --> 02:28:17,508
So whatever the rate goes up,

2167
02:28:17,944 --> 02:28:19,585
Like this year, water is going up 9%.

2168
02:28:20,405 --> 02:28:21,726
That's not us.

2169
02:28:22,106 --> 02:28:26,489
That's the MWRA charging us 9% more.

2170
02:28:26,689 --> 02:28:30,371
We wanted to offset that rate so you would not get hit that additional 9%.

2171
02:28:31,491 --> 02:28:36,914
So we as a council recognize that with this surplus money, it should be used to offset rates.

2172
02:28:37,394 --> 02:28:42,397
It should be used to do infrastructure improvements that could eventually lower your bill.

2173
02:28:43,548 --> 02:28:47,170
You know, right now, the infrastructure is crumbling under the ground.

2174
02:28:47,450 --> 02:28:48,050
You don't see it.

2175
02:28:48,711 --> 02:28:53,313
If our sidewalks and streets are crumbling, can you imagine these pipes that are 90 years old under the ground?

2176
02:28:53,553 --> 02:28:57,996
Back then, they did mention some pipes were leaking.

2177
02:28:58,296 --> 02:28:58,516
Right.

2178
02:28:58,576 --> 02:28:59,296
Oh, I remember.

2179
02:28:59,497 --> 02:28:59,697
Right.

2180
02:28:59,857 --> 02:29:02,698
And it's called I&I, inflow and infiltration.

2181
02:29:03,158 --> 02:29:07,861
And we're still dealing with that today, because we don't have a program in place to address this.

2182
02:29:08,681 --> 02:29:13,184
So every time it rains, we have water that's going into our outdated sewer pipes.

2183
02:29:14,078 --> 02:29:17,721
And it's going out to Deer Island, and it's being treated as raw sewage.

2184
02:29:18,261 --> 02:29:19,102
That's rainwater.

2185
02:29:19,142 --> 02:29:20,784
And you're paying for it, and I'm paying for it.

2186
02:29:20,944 --> 02:29:21,704
We're all paying for it.

2187
02:29:22,065 --> 02:29:24,667
But this is what we need to use the surplus money to address.

2188
02:29:25,087 --> 02:29:31,212
And in my opinion, the administration has fallen short to make these improvements.

2189
02:29:31,372 --> 02:29:33,154
The administration is at fault.

2190
02:29:33,834 --> 02:29:39,359
And we're talking like, since I've been here 15 years, I've always had issues with the water.

2191
02:29:41,053 --> 02:29:42,814
always have issue with water and sewer.

2192
02:29:43,254 --> 02:29:47,295
So far, that's the main reason I've been to these meetings, is my water bill.

2193
02:29:48,196 --> 02:29:50,477
I mean, street cleaning, yeah, I'm upset.

2194
02:29:51,117 --> 02:29:52,577
Twice a year, that's not enough.

2195
02:29:52,898 --> 02:29:55,459
And you mentioned other communities that pay $200 a year.

2196
02:29:55,779 --> 02:29:56,039
Yes.

2197
02:29:56,419 --> 02:29:58,020
I would love to hear those communities.

2198
02:29:58,140 --> 02:30:01,781
Woburn, you know why they, well, maybe because they're Wilmington.

2199
02:30:02,161 --> 02:30:03,121
Those areas don't pay us.

2200
02:30:03,142 --> 02:30:04,762
Do they have their own water supply and supply?

2201
02:30:04,802 --> 02:30:05,963
Right, they have their own water.

2202
02:30:06,443 --> 02:30:07,663
Yeah, yeah, they do.

2203
02:30:07,983 --> 02:30:09,524
Right, and what about their sewage?

2204
02:30:10,585 --> 02:30:12,366
I don't think they pay sewage.

2205
02:30:12,486 --> 02:30:13,928
They may not have sewage.

2206
02:30:14,188 --> 02:30:14,388
Right.

2207
02:30:14,608 --> 02:30:20,152
So, I mean, I think you have to compare apples to apples when you look at something and say, well, they're paying less than we are.

2208
02:30:20,953 --> 02:30:29,279
You know, as I stated last week, believe it or not, it costs one cent to get a gallon of fresh drinking water to your house.

2209
02:30:31,040 --> 02:30:31,541
One cent.

2210
02:30:34,343 --> 02:30:36,044
When you state that, people are amazed.

2211
02:30:36,324 --> 02:30:37,105
That's what it costs.

2212
02:30:38,301 --> 02:30:38,982
But I'm paying.

2213
02:30:39,182 --> 02:30:40,583
That's the best buy in the world.

2214
02:30:41,643 --> 02:30:44,646
One cent to get a gallon of fresh drinking water to your house.

2215
02:30:45,847 --> 02:30:47,268
Can they do better low in the rate?

2216
02:30:47,328 --> 02:30:47,628
Absolutely.

2217
02:30:47,668 --> 02:30:48,849
I agree with everything you said.

2218
02:30:49,389 --> 02:30:55,153
But until the administration's changed, until something happens in this community, we're going to be seeing.

2219
02:30:55,434 --> 02:30:56,634
It's going to be Groundhog Day.

2220
02:30:56,855 --> 02:30:58,716
We're going to revisit the issue over and over again.

2221
02:30:59,096 --> 02:31:00,837
And meanwhile, they have a surplus.

2222
02:31:01,998 --> 02:31:04,500
That doesn't leave a great taste in my mouth.

2223
02:31:04,620 --> 02:31:05,641
That's all I'm saying.

2224
02:31:06,001 --> 02:31:06,342
Thank you.

2225
02:31:08,463 --> 02:31:12,949
I was going to ask Marie, did they have a check to see if you had a leak?

2226
02:31:14,331 --> 02:31:15,512
They have come to my house.

2227
02:31:15,613 --> 02:31:16,334
I have no leak.

2228
02:31:16,814 --> 02:31:18,417
They could come back again and see.

2229
02:31:18,937 --> 02:31:20,620
It sounds like you might have a leak.

2230
02:31:25,608 --> 02:31:29,269
I mean, Councilwoman Knight just figured out how much usage you were using.

2231
02:31:29,329 --> 02:31:30,070
I just did some figures.

2232
02:31:30,130 --> 02:31:34,351
It looks like you're using like close to 6,000 gallons of water a year.

2233
02:31:34,991 --> 02:31:37,572
And I'm sorry, yeah, 6,000 cubic feet of water a year.

2234
02:31:37,592 --> 02:31:40,153
And mind you, I don't even have a washing machine in my house.

2235
02:31:40,193 --> 02:31:42,374
And each cubic foot's the equivalent to eight gallons.

2236
02:31:42,394 --> 02:31:43,014
I go out to the laundry.

2237
02:31:43,354 --> 02:31:52,017
Let's see if we can have the appropriate department look at the, once the new meters went in, they were supposed to have a system that could detect a leak.

2238
02:31:52,077 --> 02:31:53,198
Let's have them check 92 Bow Street.

2239
02:31:54,754 --> 02:32:05,271
specifically to see if there's any leaks through the system that we're told we're going to be able to use to help situations like this.

2240
02:32:07,438 --> 02:32:10,559
Being fresh, I'm asking a serious question, because we've had this problem in the city before.

2241
02:32:10,579 --> 02:32:11,660
Do you get along with your tenants?

2242
02:32:12,100 --> 02:32:16,322
Because some tenants... I'm a great landlord.

2243
02:32:16,362 --> 02:32:17,443
My tenants love me.

2244
02:32:17,703 --> 02:32:23,565
The reason I ask you, and the Jeannie Martin behind you, I know people that have ran that water and have got the alerts.

2245
02:32:23,665 --> 02:32:24,446
Oh, I know.

2246
02:32:24,486 --> 02:32:25,886
Just because they're fighting with the tenants.

2247
02:32:25,906 --> 02:32:26,687
Of course, of course.

2248
02:32:26,887 --> 02:32:28,347
No, I'm very lucky.

2249
02:32:28,367 --> 02:32:29,128
I have two

2250
02:32:29,808 --> 02:32:32,230
Great young, you know, no problem.

2251
02:32:32,250 --> 02:32:34,652
Leaky toilet though, you've checked their apartment?

2252
02:32:34,753 --> 02:32:37,495
I go in their apartment, I checked my apartment.

2253
02:32:38,035 --> 02:32:43,360
So, but they do have a way of seeing where the water is being used more.

2254
02:32:43,840 --> 02:32:45,062
I know the city can't see it.

2255
02:32:45,122 --> 02:32:46,142
Yeah, let's check their house.

2256
02:32:46,162 --> 02:32:46,883
So I wouldn't mind that.

2257
02:32:47,604 --> 02:32:48,364
Thank you so much.

2258
02:32:48,665 --> 02:32:48,945
Thank you.

2259
02:32:50,418 --> 02:32:50,999
Name and address.

2260
02:32:51,379 --> 02:32:52,520
Gene Martin, 10 Cummings Street.

2261
02:32:53,562 --> 02:33:00,930
I'm glad that this woman came up to speak on this topic, and I'm glad that she's here, and I encourage her to get her neighbors to come out because this is a big issue.

2262
02:33:02,652 --> 02:33:09,880
You can do, through a cumbersome process as a landlord, have a separate meter put into your apartment, but it's very cumbersome.

2263
02:33:10,550 --> 02:33:14,572
to have a separate meter for your tenant so that you have a separate bill from them.

2264
02:33:14,652 --> 02:33:19,154
But ultimately, according to the law, you are still responsible if they don't pay their water bill.

2265
02:33:19,514 --> 02:33:22,335
So it really didn't make much sense for me to go through that process.

2266
02:33:25,297 --> 02:33:28,178
In Massachusetts, I don't think you can charge for water a tenant.

2267
02:33:28,198 --> 02:33:32,500
You can't physically call it for the water.

2268
02:33:32,520 --> 02:33:36,202
They can raise your rent, but you cannot charge a tenant for water in the state of Massachusetts.

2269
02:33:36,622 --> 02:33:36,802
Right.

2270
02:33:37,402 --> 02:33:37,803
So anyway.

2271
02:33:39,379 --> 02:33:45,746
I just want to thank her for coming up, and she made a good point about comparisons to cities, apples to apples.

2272
02:33:46,146 --> 02:33:55,597
I think what we should do is see what Melrose pays, or whoever else is on the MWRA list, and see what they pay, you know, and how much overage they might have.

2273
02:33:55,677 --> 02:33:56,838
The rate from MWRA.

2274
02:34:01,686 --> 02:34:03,467
The rate structure, yeah, or whatever.

2275
02:34:03,767 --> 02:34:07,129
Because we do have an overage of $8 million, which is absolutely ridiculous.

2276
02:34:07,509 --> 02:34:11,412
We know that the mayor is doing that because he wants his bond rating to be low.

2277
02:34:11,452 --> 02:34:12,973
We know that he's misusing the money.

2278
02:34:13,033 --> 02:34:21,918
He should be returning that money back into the infrastructure of the city so that the water rates will actually be lower, and he's not doing that, and that's on him.

2279
02:34:22,678 --> 02:34:23,719
And so, thank you.

2280
02:34:24,419 --> 02:34:24,980
Move the question.

2281
02:34:29,292 --> 02:34:31,793
One quick thing to get back to what Councilor Marks was alluding to.

2282
02:34:32,513 --> 02:34:34,413
With this new, where's Marie, is she still here?

2283
02:34:36,513 --> 02:34:36,994
You're still here?

2284
02:34:38,554 --> 02:34:52,277
With this new tiered rate system that you should have gotten in your last bill, it was very hard, it wasn't even addressed, it didn't have the right time or the date, it wasn't stamped, and it gave zero to 800, 800 to 1,600, and 1,600.

2285
02:34:52,317 --> 02:34:53,437
Those were the three tiered sections.

2286
02:34:53,457 --> 02:34:54,177
Councilor Marks alluded to it,

2287
02:34:59,425 --> 02:35:03,788
getting after those people who use the most amount of water, they would be paying more.

2288
02:35:03,888 --> 02:35:15,477
Unfortunately, the way the Water and Soil Commission has set this up, the people who use the most amount of water, which would be commercial, in the commercial section, they're going to be paying one stationary rate.

2289
02:35:15,837 --> 02:35:17,799
That's the middle rate of the tiered rate system.

2290
02:35:18,519 --> 02:35:23,503
So if you own a home, as you do, and you use more than 1,650 cubic feet of

2291
02:35:26,917 --> 02:35:32,680
your house altogether uses more, you're going to be paying at a higher rate than someone who uses a lot more water.

2292
02:35:32,900 --> 02:35:39,443
And these are some of the questions that need to get addressed and discussed at the commission coming up, because it's a little bit unfair.

2293
02:35:39,783 --> 02:35:41,724
I mean, they're saying you average it out.

2294
02:35:41,864 --> 02:35:50,388
If you have one person living on the first floor, and five people living on the second, and three people living on the third, they're telling you to get the number, average it out, and divide it by three.

2295
02:35:51,032 --> 02:35:52,412
And that's what everybody should be paying.

2296
02:35:52,752 --> 02:35:54,793
It doesn't work that way.

2297
02:35:55,693 --> 02:35:57,033
And that's what we need to address.

2298
02:35:58,113 --> 02:36:00,454
I think they probably came out with this a little bit too early.

2299
02:36:00,494 --> 02:36:01,834
It should have been discussed a little more.

2300
02:36:02,474 --> 02:36:06,175
But these are some of the questions that need to get resolved.

2301
02:36:06,855 --> 02:36:07,335
Thank you.

2302
02:36:07,875 --> 02:36:08,295
You're welcome.

2303
02:36:09,796 --> 02:36:10,176
Thank you.

2304
02:36:12,936 --> 02:36:13,796
Motion for approval.

2305
02:36:14,336 --> 02:36:17,477
To send it to the

2306
02:36:18,602 --> 02:36:23,165
Water Department, 9092 Bow Street.

2307
02:36:25,787 --> 02:36:26,527
All those in favor?

2308
02:36:26,748 --> 02:36:26,848
Aye.

2309
02:36:27,248 --> 02:36:27,788
All those opposed?

2310
02:36:27,828 --> 02:36:28,349
The ayes have it.

2311
02:36:29,189 --> 02:36:36,934
Offered by Councilor Lungo Kern, be it resolved that the casino issue be discussed to update Medford voters on the harm that a casino in Everett would do to Medford.

2312
02:36:38,676 --> 02:36:39,696
Councilor Lungo Kern.

2313
02:36:43,579 --> 02:36:44,740
Thank you, Councilor Camuso.

2314
02:36:45,602 --> 02:36:50,604
I know it's a loaded discussion, but I think it has to be brought up.

2315
02:36:50,664 --> 02:36:56,747
We have two weeks till we are making a huge vote on question three.

2316
02:36:57,667 --> 02:37:11,774
And when you talk to people around town, especially at my businesses in the Wellington area, especially in the Wellington area, South Medford area, I mean, people are a little nervous that we are going to have a casino in Everett before long.

2317
02:37:11,954 --> 02:37:14,935
So I just wanted to at least

2318
02:37:15,693 --> 02:37:18,155
bring this up, let the voting public know.

2319
02:37:18,195 --> 02:37:19,896
I know it's late, but people do watch.

2320
02:37:21,117 --> 02:37:22,918
Question three is a big deal.

2321
02:37:22,978 --> 02:37:29,783
You're voting to repeal the 2011 vote, which allowed resort casinos to operate within Massachusetts.

2322
02:37:31,144 --> 02:37:35,346
There is obviously the brochure where you can read about all the questions on the ballot.

2323
02:37:35,767 --> 02:37:37,188
And I have question three here.

2324
02:37:37,228 --> 02:37:40,690
I also did some research with regards to pros and cons.

2325
02:37:41,010 --> 02:37:42,731
And it seems like, to me,

2326
02:37:44,715 --> 02:37:54,722
You know, there's an issue back and forth, pros and cons to the job, the positives about creating jobs, but even that can be rebutted.

2327
02:37:55,022 --> 02:37:59,446
If you go to this number of myths and facts about the jobs in the casinos.

2328
02:37:59,546 --> 02:38:06,050
So what I am concerned about is that Trump's anything is the crime.

2329
02:38:06,811 --> 02:38:07,772
Crime is number one.

2330
02:38:07,832 --> 02:38:12,255
I mean, we see what's going on in the South Medford neighborhood the last few months.

2331
02:38:13,403 --> 02:38:18,466
And I truly feel that a casino is going to increase crime within our neighborhoods.

2332
02:38:18,666 --> 02:38:22,329
It is going to trickle into the Wellington area, the South Medford area.

2333
02:38:23,129 --> 02:38:24,750
North Medford is going to feel a hit.

2334
02:38:28,553 --> 02:38:32,255
I know one thing when you read the ballot question when it talks about crime.

2335
02:38:33,036 --> 02:38:38,760
Indiana prosecutors needed an additional court just to handle casino-related crimes.

2336
02:38:40,241 --> 02:38:42,262
We are going to have one of the largest casinos

2337
02:38:43,821 --> 02:38:50,162
in Massachusetts, if not, you know, one of the biggest in the country, and it's very scary.

2338
02:38:50,202 --> 02:38:57,264
You know, people who are raising families do not want a casino near their children, near their schools.

2339
02:38:57,824 --> 02:39:10,967
And the types of crime, we've been over that, but I think it's going to bring a whole—we already have it, you know, the drug issue is another debate, but drugs, prostitution, I can go on and on about the crime that the casino is going to bring.

2340
02:39:11,367 --> 02:39:12,507
Number two is the traffic.

2341
02:39:12,873 --> 02:39:15,595
The traffic is a disgrace in Wellington Circle.

2342
02:39:15,615 --> 02:39:18,157
And again, it trickles into Medford.

2343
02:39:18,557 --> 02:39:21,359
It's only going to get worse, and it's going to get a lot worse.

2344
02:39:22,820 --> 02:39:25,542
You also have the issue of businesses.

2345
02:39:26,362 --> 02:39:30,705
A casino will kill the economic base in Medford.

2346
02:39:30,765 --> 02:39:32,006
It will kill our businesses.

2347
02:39:32,567 --> 02:39:40,092
It will create layoffs and closures of our small businesses that can't afford that, and we don't want that to happen.

2348
02:39:42,374 --> 02:39:50,680
We are going to bear the burden to the fruits of whatever it is going to take and however much money Wynn is going to give Everett per year.

2349
02:39:51,121 --> 02:39:53,062
We're going to bear the burden, the city of Medford.

2350
02:39:53,142 --> 02:39:55,324
So I really wanted to put this on.

2351
02:39:55,364 --> 02:40:01,328
I know some people are in favor of casino, but I truly feel that it's going to hurt Medford.

2352
02:40:01,588 --> 02:40:09,054
And I have three young children, and I don't want to see this happen right in our own backyards.

2353
02:40:12,493 --> 02:40:13,014
I could go on.

2354
02:40:13,034 --> 02:40:17,518
I did some research today, but I know it's late, and I'm sure a couple other councillors want to speak on it.

2355
02:40:17,958 --> 02:40:20,780
I just wanted to let everybody know, question three is on the ballot.

2356
02:40:20,820 --> 02:40:23,503
If you vote yes, you will repeal the law.

2357
02:40:24,564 --> 02:40:28,927
Could it be something that could go down in Springfield and in other communities?

2358
02:40:29,067 --> 02:40:39,196
Maybe, but right in Everett, in this thickly settled area, I don't think we have the street capacity for it with regards to traffic, and I don't think

2359
02:40:40,647 --> 02:40:44,290
Our law enforcement should have to bear this burden, nor our residents.

2360
02:40:51,135 --> 02:40:51,556
Thank you.

2361
02:40:54,598 --> 02:40:55,519
Councillor Belarusso.

2362
02:40:55,939 --> 02:41:00,243
Thank you, Mr. President, and thank you, Councillor Longo-Kern, for bringing this matter up.

2363
02:41:00,943 --> 02:41:02,725
I did want to speak tonight not

2364
02:41:04,072 --> 02:41:32,447
on this issue in particular, but remind voters we've seen in recent years a decrease in lack of interest in elections and voting, and you bring up one particular ballot issue that's on there, a referendum issue, but we have to elect a new governor, lieutenant governor, all the state offices, a representative to the great and general court, a senator,

2365
02:41:34,507 --> 02:41:43,670
So we have to, a United States Senator and a Congressperson, and we have to address all these referendum issues.

2366
02:41:44,270 --> 02:41:53,794
And I just want to echo Councilor Longo-Kern's urging to the citizens to get out and vote.

2367
02:41:53,934 --> 02:42:02,937
And to do- If I may, just real quick, as the Chair, I think this is going down a slippery slope where it's a political question, so I would just ask Councilors not to

2368
02:42:04,540 --> 02:42:20,123
because this body has sometimes went down this in the past, and... I'm just asking the councilors to... It's a political question.

2369
02:42:20,203 --> 02:42:31,906
It's no different than getting up here and saying support candidate A or candidate B. So I understand the president's concerns, and my point maybe was a little long to get at, but I urge citizens to

2370
02:42:32,537 --> 02:42:39,700
use that resource that the councilor has in her hands, maybe if she can hold it up and show it, that it's a guide to the ballot questions.

2371
02:42:40,260 --> 02:42:52,884
And so that we urge, as a councilor, all the citizens to get out and vote and to be well informed by using these resources that are available to them from the Secretary of State.

2372
02:42:58,747 --> 02:42:59,727
Name and address for the record.

2373
02:43:00,262 --> 02:43:03,026
Gene Martin, 10 Cumming Street, and I can talk about it, thank you.

2374
02:43:03,566 --> 02:43:07,491
And of course, as you know, I'm against having a casino, but the casino is coming.

2375
02:43:07,772 --> 02:43:10,695
Gene, Gene, we're not taking stances on this issue.

2376
02:43:10,715 --> 02:43:12,057
You can talk about... Oh, I can't do that?

2377
02:43:12,097 --> 02:43:12,678
No, no one can.

2378
02:43:12,718 --> 02:43:15,201
This is a government forum, it's not a political forum.

2379
02:43:16,458 --> 02:43:16,698
Really?

2380
02:43:17,158 --> 02:43:17,458
What?

2381
02:43:17,698 --> 02:43:18,899
All right, let us speak.

2382
02:43:18,939 --> 02:43:19,859
Wait a minute.

2383
02:43:19,879 --> 02:43:20,999
Wait a minute for me.

2384
02:43:21,019 --> 02:43:24,720
Council, if you want, we could put this off for a week and ask the Ethics Commission for guidance.

2385
02:43:24,800 --> 02:43:25,301
No, no, no.

2386
02:43:25,381 --> 02:43:26,561
This has an impact.

2387
02:43:26,721 --> 02:43:29,662
She's giving her opinion as it relates to the question.

2388
02:43:30,062 --> 02:43:30,962
On a ballot question.

2389
02:43:30,982 --> 02:43:31,702
On a ballot question.

2390
02:43:31,943 --> 02:43:32,383
That's OK.

2391
02:43:32,403 --> 02:43:33,263
There's nothing wrong with that.

2392
02:43:33,283 --> 02:43:33,783
But I'm a citizen.

2393
02:43:33,823 --> 02:43:37,424
This council voted seven to nothing on three separate occasions.

2394
02:43:37,624 --> 02:43:39,805
For the issue, not on a ballot question.

2395
02:43:40,865 --> 02:43:42,966
She can discuss the ballot question if she wants.

2396
02:43:45,222 --> 02:43:47,243
I would ask that we table this for one week and get guidance.

2397
02:43:47,263 --> 02:43:48,323
This is a political question.

2398
02:43:49,204 --> 02:43:52,325
You can speak, just don't talk about the ballot question, then, if that's the issue.

2399
02:43:52,365 --> 02:43:55,626
We're going to be getting sued by Atlawin tomorrow morning if you allow this to come up.

2400
02:43:55,826 --> 02:43:57,727
Well, you know, he's got a point there.

2401
02:43:58,087 --> 02:43:58,608
No, seriously.

2402
02:43:58,828 --> 02:44:00,268
The man is a very powerful person.

2403
02:44:00,428 --> 02:44:01,409
No, we're not worried about that.

2404
02:44:01,429 --> 02:44:03,169
We're worried about following the mass general law.

2405
02:44:03,530 --> 02:44:04,830
Oh, OK.

2406
02:44:06,251 --> 02:44:09,472
Just in general, it's... She can speak about casinos.

2407
02:44:09,712 --> 02:44:10,573
Speak about casinos.

2408
02:44:10,633 --> 02:44:11,453
If it comes in,

2409
02:44:12,658 --> 02:44:16,340
We need to be prepared for if it comes in, let's put it that way.

2410
02:44:16,980 --> 02:44:22,382
Because I've talked to a lot of people that live outside of this area, and they're all voting.

2411
02:44:22,402 --> 02:44:24,443
They're all just loyal.

2412
02:44:24,723 --> 02:44:26,304
And so it's going to come.

2413
02:44:26,704 --> 02:44:28,245
And if it comes, what are we going to do?

2414
02:44:28,625 --> 02:44:29,785
How are we going to prepare for what?

2415
02:44:29,805 --> 02:44:32,947
How are we going to prepare Wellington Circle for the traffic?

2416
02:44:33,447 --> 02:44:35,628
How are we going to prepare law enforcement?

2417
02:44:36,320 --> 02:44:41,022
and firefighters and everybody else that's involved, DPW workers and everybody else.

2418
02:44:41,322 --> 02:44:43,403
We need to prepare for what is inevitable.

2419
02:44:44,363 --> 02:44:45,624
In my opinion, it's inevitable.

2420
02:44:46,024 --> 02:44:46,444
It's coming.

2421
02:44:47,124 --> 02:44:51,926
So we need to prepare ourselves as a city for what is coming to hit us.

2422
02:44:52,546 --> 02:44:53,627
And it's going to be a big hit.

2423
02:44:54,607 --> 02:44:57,829
socially, economically, you name it.

2424
02:44:58,169 --> 02:45:02,052
It's going to make a cultural change in that whole region, Wellington Circle.

2425
02:45:02,132 --> 02:45:09,816
It's going to make a huge cultural change for that whole region, including me, because I'm kind of like not far from that, up Route 16.

2426
02:45:10,096 --> 02:45:13,278
Route 16 traffic is going to get backed up, and it's inevitable.

2427
02:45:13,698 --> 02:45:16,520
So I just wanted to say that, that we need to be prepared for it.

2428
02:45:16,560 --> 02:45:17,901
We need to have a master plan.

2429
02:45:18,361 --> 02:45:21,683
We need to get everybody on board with what we're going to do when it comes in.

2430
02:45:22,823 --> 02:45:24,365
I'm against it, but it's coming.

2431
02:45:24,625 --> 02:45:24,925
Thank you.

2432
02:45:25,265 --> 02:45:25,786
Mr. President.

2433
02:45:27,727 --> 02:45:32,550
Today I was at a conference down in Plymouth, and this was one of the concerns that were brought up.

2434
02:45:33,131 --> 02:45:40,356
And so we won't get into the subject matter of each ballot question other than the fact that people have a huge responsibility to vote.

2435
02:45:41,017 --> 02:45:48,682
And by having this responsibility to vote, Councilwoman, if you don't mind, this ballot question has gone out to each and every person in this community.

2436
02:45:49,543 --> 02:45:51,304
They should read it, make their own decisions,

2437
02:45:51,691 --> 02:45:53,893
There are a lot of constitutional offices up for grabs.

2438
02:45:54,353 --> 02:46:00,117
You can't complain about something wrong with government if you don't pick yourself up and get involved and go and vote.

2439
02:46:00,757 --> 02:46:01,658
And that's the bottom line.

2440
02:46:01,678 --> 02:46:02,859
You can't say it any other way.

2441
02:46:02,879 --> 02:46:05,180
I don't think the council's here.

2442
02:46:05,240 --> 02:46:08,823
Maybe individually a councilor can express their own opinion off the record.

2443
02:46:09,243 --> 02:46:10,764
Not at a council meeting, that's one thing.

2444
02:46:11,104 --> 02:46:14,186
But more importantly, the fact of the matter is that you can go and vote.

2445
02:46:14,286 --> 02:46:15,808
These questions are there to be asked.

2446
02:46:16,468 --> 02:46:17,989
There are candidates running for office.

2447
02:46:18,009 --> 02:46:20,211
And they have to be taking positions when they're asked.

2448
02:46:21,104 --> 02:46:22,205
who are running have to be asked.

2449
02:46:22,605 --> 02:46:25,926
But the underlying theme to this whole commentary is basically this.

2450
02:46:26,407 --> 02:46:38,333
Don't complain if you're not going to be involved by voting or actively participating in some shape, mean, or form, whether it be in a discussion, supporting a candidate, not supporting a candidate, supporting an issue, not supporting an issue.

2451
02:46:38,353 --> 02:46:39,513
Because that's what government's all about.

2452
02:46:39,894 --> 02:46:41,574
And that's the problem with this country is right now.

2453
02:46:41,935 --> 02:46:45,997
The apathy that's out there, the complacency that's out there, it's terrible.

2454
02:46:46,557 --> 02:46:48,418
And unless people start to relook and

2455
02:46:48,802 --> 02:46:53,305
think that this country can find itself again, you're not going to do it unless you go out and vote.

2456
02:46:53,345 --> 02:46:54,286
And that's the bottom line.

2457
02:46:54,706 --> 02:46:55,007
Thank you.

2458
02:47:11,261 --> 02:47:19,563
Two weeks ago, Mr. President, I asked for a complete audit of the finances that have been received to date regarding the dog park.

2459
02:47:20,643 --> 02:47:23,464
And we have yet to receive a response on that.

2460
02:47:26,624 --> 02:47:28,905
Should we send another question again?

2461
02:47:29,045 --> 02:47:32,785
Or I'm not sure how long it takes.

2462
02:47:32,845 --> 02:47:37,306
Yeah, I'm not sure what the secret is of what the finances are on the dog park.

2463
02:47:37,726 --> 02:47:39,707
The mayor has already publicly come out and said that

2464
02:47:41,132 --> 02:47:41,472
J.F.

2465
02:47:41,532 --> 02:47:44,434
White gave money for mitigation for the park.

2466
02:47:45,094 --> 02:47:50,618
There's been fundraisers held in this community where residents have donated money towards a dog park.

2467
02:47:51,118 --> 02:48:00,484
And I don't understand why we can't have transparency when we ask a question of where is the finance and how much money is in the account, Mr. President.

2468
02:48:00,744 --> 02:48:02,025
It just doesn't make any sense to me.

2469
02:48:02,405 --> 02:48:04,626
It shouldn't take several weeks to get that answer.

2470
02:48:05,046 --> 02:48:10,790
So, again, I ask respectfully, Mr. President, that requests go back out to the administration.

2471
02:48:11,732 --> 02:48:14,833
On the motion of Councilor Marks, all those in favor?

2472
02:48:15,214 --> 02:48:15,314
Aye.

2473
02:48:15,874 --> 02:48:16,554
All those opposed?

2474
02:48:17,114 --> 02:48:17,715
The ayes have it.

2475
02:48:18,355 --> 02:48:21,737
The tabled records of October 7th were passed to Vice President Caraviello.

2476
02:48:23,537 --> 02:48:26,038
I review the records, Mr. President, and I find them in order.

2477
02:48:27,079 --> 02:48:29,500
On the motion of approval of those records, all those in favor?

2478
02:48:29,840 --> 02:48:29,940
Aye.

2479
02:48:30,721 --> 02:48:31,321
All those opposed?

2480
02:48:31,361 --> 02:48:31,881
The ayes have it.

2481
02:48:32,341 --> 02:48:36,243
Item, the records of October 14th were passed to Councilor De La Russo.

2482
02:48:37,143 --> 02:48:38,104
How do you find those records?

2483
02:48:38,537 --> 02:48:43,483
Mr. President, upon inspection of those records, I found them to be in order and motion for their approval.

2484
02:48:43,964 --> 02:48:45,526
On the motion of approval, all those in favor?

2485
02:48:45,946 --> 02:48:46,026
Aye.

2486
02:48:46,307 --> 02:48:46,887
All those opposed?

2487
02:48:47,448 --> 02:48:47,869
Aye.

2488
02:48:48,349 --> 02:48:51,273
On the motion of Council Appendix for adjournment, all those in favor?

2489
02:48:51,293 --> 02:48:51,693
Aye.

2490
02:48:52,174 --> 02:48:52,815
All those opposed?
