1
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:21,551
What team is this?

2
00:00:21,871 --> 00:00:24,273
You guys any good?

3
00:00:24,293 --> 00:00:24,933
Are you any good?

4
00:00:25,273 --> 00:00:27,375
Yeah.

5
00:00:28,336 --> 00:00:33,079
Are you going to hit a home run this year?

6
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:35,141
What is it?

7
00:00:35,881 --> 00:00:36,401
The Mariners.

8
00:00:36,482 --> 00:00:37,502
Are you on the Mariners?

9
00:00:38,823 --> 00:00:39,123
Yeah.

10
00:00:39,464 --> 00:00:40,204
Are you on the Mariners?

11
00:00:40,244 --> 00:00:44,567
You're on the Dodgers?

12
00:00:44,608 --> 00:00:47,470
You're going to have a good team coach?

13
00:00:48,638 --> 00:00:49,319
I think so.

14
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:51,281
We have a good time either way.

15
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:52,362
Did you recruit?

16
00:00:52,382 --> 00:00:53,483
Did you do scouting?

17
00:00:53,543 --> 00:00:56,666
Oh yeah, heavy duty scouting.

18
00:00:56,846 --> 00:00:57,887
Those are the faces.

19
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,722
The judges are right here, the majors.

20
00:01:21,742 --> 00:01:23,723
All right, let's get these cubs together.

21
00:01:23,743 --> 00:01:25,184
Come on, man.

22
00:01:25,984 --> 00:01:29,727
We're doing a parade for Memphis Little League.

23
00:01:29,747 --> 00:01:30,748
One of our fans here.

24
00:01:30,788 --> 00:01:31,348
Say hi.

25
00:01:31,828 --> 00:01:31,908
Hi.

26
00:01:50,028 --> 00:01:51,469
Get out of here Yankees!

27
00:01:51,549 --> 00:01:52,470
Here we go!

28
00:02:30,122 --> 00:02:33,003
Very exciting day for the City of Meffitt.

29
00:02:33,023 --> 00:02:34,764
We have the opening day of Little League here.

30
00:02:34,784 --> 00:02:41,688
It's a beautiful day as you can see there's thousands of little kids out here from the City of Meffitt enjoying a fun-filled packed day with their parents.

31
00:02:41,748 --> 00:02:43,128
Say the Blue Jays!

32
00:02:44,629 --> 00:02:53,273
Blue Jays!

33
00:02:55,554 --> 00:02:56,255
Go Mariners!

34
00:03:36,822 --> 00:03:38,968
That's great!

35
00:03:39,309 --> 00:03:42,597
High five!

36
00:04:11,672 --> 00:04:12,413
okay

37
00:04:41,873 --> 00:04:44,275
The Yankees still traveling here.

38
00:04:44,355 --> 00:04:45,996
How you doing?

39
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:47,617
Cut the Yankees off.

40
00:05:30,818 --> 00:05:35,920
You trying to steal my wife Christian?

41
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:36,760
You got a smile!

42
00:06:10,686 --> 00:06:11,346
Good job, guys.

43
00:06:11,486 --> 00:06:12,866
All right, here we go.

44
00:06:12,886 --> 00:06:17,527
Wave for the camera.

45
00:06:17,667 --> 00:06:19,627
Let's go, let's go.

46
00:06:20,148 --> 00:06:25,949
I guess his daddy had to take him.

47
00:06:26,929 --> 00:06:29,770
Maybe they had something to go to.

48
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:33,510
What channel is it on?

49
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:33,510
3!

50
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:34,531
Channel 3 in Medford!

51
00:06:34,591 --> 00:06:35,151
Channel 3 TV!

52
00:06:58,654 --> 00:07:00,577
Okay, I'll go check it out.

53
00:07:00,617 --> 00:07:01,178
Hydrate.

54
00:07:01,198 --> 00:07:01,939
Say hydrate.

55
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:02,700
Hydrate.

56
00:07:02,761 --> 00:07:03,802
Hydrate.

57
00:07:04,303 --> 00:07:06,386
Hydrate, y'all.

58
00:07:06,406 --> 00:07:06,707
Mets.

59
00:07:06,787 --> 00:07:07,528
Say go Mets.

60
00:07:08,349 --> 00:07:08,790
Mets.

61
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:09,231
Go Mets.

62
00:07:12,263 --> 00:07:13,063
Yeah! 100!

63
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:46,551
They play ball guys.

64
00:08:10,876 --> 00:08:11,777
I'm on the news!

65
00:08:11,877 --> 00:08:12,357
I'm on the news!

66
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:38,430
Who pitches?

67
00:08:40,091 --> 00:08:42,272
Any pitchers on this team?

68
00:08:42,292 --> 00:08:42,752
Who pitches?

69
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:45,814
Who's the big papa of your team?

70
00:09:02,406 --> 00:09:03,066
Go Cardinals!

71
00:09:03,727 --> 00:09:04,527
Go Cardinals!

72
00:09:04,687 --> 00:09:05,447
Go Cardinals!

73
00:09:05,727 --> 00:09:09,049
What's it like coaching Little League?

74
00:09:09,349 --> 00:09:10,089
It's living the dream.

75
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:12,330
It's what I was born to do.

76
00:09:23,615 --> 00:09:26,736
These are the heavy hitters right here.

77
00:09:26,776 --> 00:09:27,756
Batting clean up.

78
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:28,597
The Giants ready?

79
00:09:48,178 --> 00:09:51,782
This is like 12 and 11's.

80
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:55,205
Triple A is 11 and 10.

81
00:09:55,245 --> 00:09:56,807
Double A is 8 and 9.

82
00:09:57,287 --> 00:09:58,709
That's a couple shuffles.

83
00:09:59,069 --> 00:10:00,671
And then what happens after they get out of Little League?

84
00:10:01,712 --> 00:10:04,574
A lot of kids play Babe Ruth or AAU baseball.

85
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:11,461
Go A's!

86
00:10:11,501 --> 00:10:11,881
Go A's!

87
00:10:11,921 --> 00:10:13,782
What's the first letter of the alphabet?

88
00:10:35,228 --> 00:10:36,469
All right, we do our duty.

89
00:11:00,985 --> 00:11:01,306
Yeah.

90
00:11:11,852 --> 00:11:12,172
Hey, sir.

91
00:11:36,098 --> 00:11:37,098
Isn't this exciting?

92
00:11:37,118 --> 00:11:37,639
Absolutely.

93
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:38,319
Opening day.

94
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:39,619
It's the best.

95
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:41,240
John, how many kids do you have in the program?

96
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,220
I have one this year.

97
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:42,720
What team?

98
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:43,781
The Orioles.

99
00:11:44,141 --> 00:11:44,501
Orioles.

100
00:11:44,841 --> 00:11:45,501
Go Orioles.

101
00:11:45,561 --> 00:11:47,502
Go Orioles.

102
00:11:47,722 --> 00:11:47,982
Mom.

103
00:11:48,722 --> 00:11:48,982
Mom.

104
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:50,303
Mom.

105
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:51,283
Oh, me mom.

106
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:53,164
What are you holding?

107
00:11:53,284 --> 00:11:54,164
What are you holding?

108
00:11:54,184 --> 00:11:55,444
This is called a hockey stick.

109
00:11:55,545 --> 00:11:55,705
And?

110
00:11:55,725 --> 00:11:58,105
Because my hockey child plays baseball too.

111
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:07,821
You're going to go on YouTube if you wave.

112
00:12:07,881 --> 00:12:10,363
Wave, you'll get on YouTube.

113
00:12:20,568 --> 00:12:22,409
Give me another one.

114
00:12:22,769 --> 00:12:24,750
Can I give you one?

115
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:26,910
How about two?

116
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:27,570
Say hi.

117
00:12:45,616 --> 00:12:51,637
That's right, they like to play in the dirt where it's nice and wet.

118
00:13:15,783 --> 00:13:20,225
What we're going to look to do is we're going to have a quick national anthem.

119
00:13:20,305 --> 00:13:22,966
It's going to be sung by Renee and Kara Messerschmitt.

120
00:13:40,216 --> 00:13:44,201
So they're nice enough to come and sing the national anthem for us.

121
00:13:44,521 --> 00:13:49,867
So what we're looking to do is just give them the opportunity to sing, and then we'll have an opening day ceremony.

122
00:13:50,267 --> 00:13:50,588
Thank you.

123
00:13:55,535 --> 00:14:13,281
Oh, say can you see by the dawn's early light What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming?

124
00:14:13,761 --> 00:14:22,184
Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight

125
00:14:23,144 --> 00:14:31,171
O'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming?

126
00:14:31,372 --> 00:14:49,448
And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air, Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there.

127
00:14:50,368 --> 00:15:12,628
Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?

128
00:15:17,861 --> 00:15:22,665
Come over and basically speak the pledge for Method Little League.

129
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:23,946
I love its country.

130
00:15:23,966 --> 00:15:26,388
I respect its laws.

131
00:15:26,528 --> 00:15:28,250
I will play fair and strive to win.

132
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:30,592
But win or lose, I will always do my best.

133
00:15:31,192 --> 00:15:31,753
Nice job.

134
00:15:31,793 --> 00:15:32,233
Nice job.

135
00:15:33,154 --> 00:15:33,654
Nice job.

136
00:15:33,694 --> 00:15:34,115
Nice job.

137
00:15:37,118 --> 00:15:40,699
And what we also do, too, is we have a coach's pledge.

138
00:15:41,139 --> 00:15:43,059
It was something that we put in back in 2013.

139
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:47,980
I was going to have Joe Salera read it, so I'm going to bring him out right now and have him read it.

140
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,260
So, Joe, why don't you come out and read this?

141
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:52,661
I know, Joe.

142
00:15:52,681 --> 00:15:53,261
Great fun.

143
00:15:53,281 --> 00:15:53,701
We love that.

144
00:15:57,561 --> 00:15:58,782
Medford Little League culture.

145
00:15:58,882 --> 00:15:59,162
Louder.

146
00:15:59,882 --> 00:16:02,562
One, coaching is always a privilege.

147
00:16:03,522 --> 00:16:06,483
We are coaching for life, not for one game or one season.

148
00:16:07,572 --> 00:16:12,355
I am coaching the top of the batting order, the bottom of the batting order, and the bench.

149
00:16:12,635 --> 00:16:14,396
Every player should spend time on each.

150
00:16:15,477 --> 00:16:17,819
I will keep the great game fun for all players.

151
00:16:18,717 --> 00:16:24,322
This is Little League, and these are young people that will have an impact on good or bad.

152
00:16:25,163 --> 00:16:27,866
I am responsible for the team and league cultures.

153
00:16:28,567 --> 00:16:33,612
I will coach the way I would want my child coached if I was watching from the stands.

154
00:16:34,472 --> 00:16:39,938
I will emphasize effort, learning, and improving, and bouncing back from mistakes.

155
00:16:43,017 --> 00:16:46,120
These are all things in the player's control.

156
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:50,524
By focusing on these things, we reduce anxiety, increase confidence.

157
00:16:51,685 --> 00:16:58,712
Contrast these with focusing on results, compassion to others, or the mistakes are not okay.

158
00:17:00,907 --> 00:17:03,009
These are all out of the players' control.

159
00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:10,074
I will set a culture of respect for rules, opponents, officials, teammates, and self-roots.

160
00:17:10,855 --> 00:17:12,436
I will look for teachable moments.

161
00:17:13,057 --> 00:17:28,730
I will keep my players emotionally, emotional tanks filled, look for opportunities to give truthful, specific encouragement, expressing appreciation, listening, exhibiting positive body language.

162
00:17:29,949 --> 00:17:40,600
Contrast to criticizing, correcting, sarcasm, ignoring, ex-a-bigot, ex-a-visiting, negative body language.

163
00:17:42,943 --> 00:17:47,868
Note points 8, 9, and 10 are adapted from Positive Coaching Alliance materials.

164
00:17:49,477 --> 00:18:03,009
Tufts University and the Positive Coaching Alliance, we work with them pretty closely in terms of training the coaches for just basically working with kids and just making sure they have access and opportunities to positive reinforcements.

165
00:18:03,389 --> 00:18:09,835
So that's one of the opportunities that we're trying to provide as a community for the kids in MedFed and the MedFed Little League program.

166
00:18:10,295 --> 00:18:14,763
And what I'd like to do is just provide this opportunity for Mayor Burke to come up and just have to say a couple of words.

167
00:18:15,163 --> 00:18:21,033
We've been partnering with her with the Community Preservation Act in order to do some reservations, some recreation programs.

168
00:18:21,394 --> 00:18:23,878
So I'll just give her an opportunity to say hello.

169
00:18:28,672 --> 00:18:30,513
Thank you everyone for being here today.

170
00:18:30,773 --> 00:18:34,115
It's a great sight out there seeing this rainbow of colors in our field.

171
00:18:34,615 --> 00:18:36,957
And as Tyler said, always do your best.

172
00:18:37,017 --> 00:18:37,977
That's all that matters.

173
00:18:38,057 --> 00:18:41,880
Always just do the best you can and be a great teammate because it's so important.

174
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:45,742
You learn these lessons now and they carry through your entire life.

175
00:18:46,162 --> 00:18:54,651
So to all the parents that are helping out and the parents that are at home throwing balls and tape balls and everything else, thank you so much for being a part of this great community.

176
00:18:54,871 --> 00:18:56,272
Have fun, play ball!

177
00:19:00,152 --> 00:19:03,873
So what we're going to do now is we're going to ask the kids to come up with their gloves.

178
00:19:03,933 --> 00:19:11,494
We're going to ask, we have City Council Michael Mox, City Council John Falco, and we have Mia Mustone, who's also a coach.

179
00:19:11,514 --> 00:19:14,055
