1
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:21,551
[SPEAKER_03]: What team is this?

2
00:00:21,871 --> 00:00:24,273
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys any good?

3
00:00:24,293 --> 00:00:24,933
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you any good?

4
00:00:25,273 --> 00:00:27,375
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

5
00:00:28,336 --> 00:00:33,079
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you going to hit a home run this year?

6
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:35,141
[SPEAKER_04]: What is it?

7
00:00:35,881 --> 00:00:36,401
[SPEAKER_04]: The Mariners.

8
00:00:36,482 --> 00:00:37,502
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you on the Mariners?

9
00:00:38,823 --> 00:00:39,123
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

10
00:00:39,464 --> 00:00:40,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you on the Mariners?

11
00:00:40,244 --> 00:00:44,567
[SPEAKER_11]: You're on the Dodgers?

12
00:00:44,608 --> 00:00:47,470
[SPEAKER_11]: You're going to have a good team coach?

13
00:00:48,638 --> 00:00:49,319
[SPEAKER_03]: I think so.

14
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:51,281
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a good time either way.

15
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:52,362
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you recruit?

16
00:00:52,382 --> 00:00:53,483
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you do scouting?

17
00:00:53,543 --> 00:00:56,666
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, heavy duty scouting.

18
00:00:56,846 --> 00:00:57,887
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are the faces.

19
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,722
[SPEAKER_11]: The judges are right here, the majors.

20
00:01:21,742 --> 00:01:23,723
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, let's get these cubs together.

21
00:01:23,743 --> 00:01:25,184
[SPEAKER_11]: Come on, man.

22
00:01:25,984 --> 00:01:29,727
[SPEAKER_07]: We're doing a parade for Medford Little League.

23
00:01:29,747 --> 00:01:30,748
[SPEAKER_07]: One of our fans here.

24
00:01:30,788 --> 00:01:31,348
[SPEAKER_07]: Say hi.

25
00:01:31,828 --> 00:01:31,908
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi.

26
00:01:50,028 --> 00:01:51,469
[SPEAKER_07]: Get out of here Yankees!

27
00:01:51,549 --> 00:01:52,470
Here we go!

28
00:02:30,122 --> 00:02:33,003
[SPEAKER_08]: Very exciting day for the City of Medford.

29
00:02:33,023 --> 00:02:34,764
[SPEAKER_08]: We have the opening day of Little League here.

30
00:02:34,784 --> 00:02:41,688
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a beautiful day as you can see there's thousands of little kids out here from the City of Medford enjoying a fun-filled packed day with their parents.

31
00:02:41,748 --> 00:02:43,128
[SPEAKER_08]: Say the Blue Jays!

32
00:02:44,629 --> 00:02:53,273
[SPEAKER_08]: Blue Jays!

33
00:02:55,554 --> 00:02:56,255
[SPEAKER_04]: Go Mariners!

00:03:36,822 --> 00:03:38,968
That's great!

35
00:03:39,309 --> 00:03:42,597
High five!

36
00:04:11,672 --> 00:04:12,413
[SPEAKER_07]: okay

37
00:04:41,873 --> 00:04:44,275
[SPEAKER_02]: The Yankees still traveling here.

38
00:04:44,355 --> 00:04:45,996
[SPEAKER_02]: How you doing?

39
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:47,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Cut the Yankees off.

40
00:05:30,818 --> 00:05:35,920
[SPEAKER_10]: You trying to steal my wife Christian?

41
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:36,760
[SPEAKER_10]: You got a smile!

42
00:06:10,686 --> 00:06:11,346
[SPEAKER_08]: Good job, guys.

43
00:06:11,486 --> 00:06:12,866
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, here we go.

44
00:06:12,886 --> 00:06:17,527
[SPEAKER_10]: Wave for the camera.

45
00:06:17,667 --> 00:06:19,627
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's go, let's go.

46
00:06:20,148 --> 00:06:25,949
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess his daddy had to take him.

47
00:06:26,929 --> 00:06:29,770
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe they had something to go to.

48
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:33,510
[SPEAKER_10]: What channel is it on?

49
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:33,510
3!

50
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:34,531
[SPEAKER_10]: Channel 3 in Medford!

51
00:06:34,591 --> 00:06:35,151
[SPEAKER_10]: Channel 3 TV!

52
00:06:58,654 --> 00:07:00,577
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I'll go check it out.

53
00:07:00,617 --> 00:07:01,178
[SPEAKER_04]: Hydrate.

54
00:07:01,198 --> 00:07:01,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Say hydrate.

55
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:02,700
[SPEAKER_04]: Hydrate.

56
00:07:02,761 --> 00:07:03,802
[SPEAKER_10]: Hydrate.

57
00:07:04,303 --> 00:07:06,386
[SPEAKER_10]: Hydrate, y'all.

58
00:07:06,406 --> 00:07:06,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Mets.

59
00:07:06,787 --> 00:07:07,528
[SPEAKER_10]: Say go Mets.

60
00:07:08,349 --> 00:07:08,790
[SPEAKER_02]: Mets.

61
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:09,231
[SPEAKER_02]: Go Mets.

62
00:07:12,263 --> 00:07:13,063
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah! 100!

63
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:46,551
[SPEAKER_11]: They play ball guys.

64
00:08:10,876 --> 00:08:11,777
I'm on the news!

65
00:08:11,877 --> 00:08:12,357
I'm on the news!

66
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:38,430
Who pitches?

67
00:08:40,091 --> 00:08:42,272
Any pitchers on this team?

68
00:08:42,292 --> 00:08:42,752
Who pitches?

69
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:45,814
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's the big papa of your team?

70
00:09:02,406 --> 00:09:03,066
[SPEAKER_04]: Go Cardinals!

71
00:09:03,727 --> 00:09:04,527
[SPEAKER_04]: Go Cardinals!

72
00:09:04,687 --> 00:09:05,447
[SPEAKER_04]: Go Cardinals!

73
00:09:05,727 --> 00:09:09,049
[SPEAKER_10]: What's it like coaching Little League?

74
00:09:09,349 --> 00:09:10,089
[SPEAKER_04]: It's living the dream.

75
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:12,330
[SPEAKER_10]: It's what I was born to do.

76
00:09:23,615 --> 00:09:26,736
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the heavy hitters right here.

77
00:09:26,776 --> 00:09:27,756
[SPEAKER_03]: Batting clean up.

78
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:28,597
[SPEAKER_03]: The Giants ready?

79
00:09:48,178 --> 00:09:51,782
[SPEAKER_12]: This is like 12 and 11's.

80
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:55,205
[SPEAKER_12]: Triple A is 11 and 10.

81
00:09:55,245 --> 00:09:56,807
[SPEAKER_12]: Double A is 8 and 9.

82
00:09:57,287 --> 00:09:58,709
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a couple shuffles.

83
00:09:59,069 --> 00:10:00,671
[SPEAKER_12]: And then what happens after they get out of Little League?

84
00:10:01,712 --> 00:10:04,574
[SPEAKER_12]: A lot of kids play Babe Ruth or AAU baseball.

85
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:11,461
[SPEAKER_11]: Go A's!

86
00:10:11,501 --> 00:10:11,881
[SPEAKER_11]: Go A's!

87
00:10:11,921 --> 00:10:13,782
[SPEAKER_11]: What's the first letter of the alphabet?

88
00:10:35,228 --> 00:10:36,469
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, we do our duty.

89
00:11:00,985 --> 00:11:01,306
Yeah.

90
00:11:11,852 --> 00:11:12,172
Hey, sir.

91
00:11:36,098 --> 00:11:37,098
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't this exciting?

92
00:11:37,118 --> 00:11:37,639
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.

93
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:38,319
[SPEAKER_10]: Opening day.

94
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:39,619
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the best.

95
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:41,240
[SPEAKER_04]: John, how many kids do you have in the program?

96
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,220
[SPEAKER_04]: I have one this year.

97
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:42,720
[SPEAKER_04]: What team?

98
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:43,781
[SPEAKER_10]: The Orioles.

99
00:11:44,141 --> 00:11:44,501
[SPEAKER_04]: Orioles.

100
00:11:44,841 --> 00:11:45,501
[SPEAKER_04]: Go Orioles.

101
00:11:45,561 --> 00:11:47,502
[SPEAKER_06]: Go Orioles.

102
00:11:47,722 --> 00:11:47,982
[SPEAKER_04]: Mom.

103
00:11:48,722 --> 00:11:48,982
[SPEAKER_04]: Mom.

104
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:50,303
[SPEAKER_03]: Mom.

105
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:51,283
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, me mom.

106
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:53,164
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you holding?

107
00:11:53,284 --> 00:11:54,164
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you holding?

108
00:11:54,184 --> 00:11:55,444
[SPEAKER_03]: This is called a hockey stick.

109
00:11:55,545 --> 00:11:55,705
[SPEAKER_03]: And?

110
00:11:55,725 --> 00:11:58,105
[SPEAKER_06]: Because my hockey child plays baseball too.

111
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:07,821
[SPEAKER_10]: You're going to go on YouTube if you wave.

112
00:12:07,881 --> 00:12:10,363
[SPEAKER_10]: Wave, you'll get on YouTube.

113
00:12:20,568 --> 00:12:22,409
[SPEAKER_11]: Give me another one.

114
00:12:22,769 --> 00:12:24,750
[SPEAKER_11]: Can I give you one?

115
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:26,910
[SPEAKER_11]: How about two?

116
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:27,570
[SPEAKER_11]: Say hi.

117
00:12:45,616 --> 00:12:51,637
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right, they like to play in the dirt where it's nice and wet.

118
00:13:15,783 --> 00:13:20,225
[SPEAKER_10]: What we're going to look to do is we're going to have a quick national anthem.

119
00:13:20,305 --> 00:13:22,966
It's going to be sung by Renee and Kara Messerschmitt.

120
00:13:40,216 --> 00:13:44,201
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're nice enough to come and sing the national anthem for us.

121
00:13:44,521 --> 00:13:49,867
[SPEAKER_07]: So what we're looking to do is just give them the opportunity to sing, and then we'll have an opening day ceremony.

122
00:13:50,267 --> 00:13:50,588
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

123
00:13:55,535 --> 00:14:13,281
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, say can you see by the dawn's early light What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming?

124
00:14:13,761 --> 00:14:22,184
[SPEAKER_09]: Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight

125
00:14:23,144 --> 00:14:31,171
[SPEAKER_09]: O'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming?

126
00:14:31,372 --> 00:14:49,448
[SPEAKER_09]: And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air, Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there.

127
00:14:50,368 --> 00:15:12,628
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?

128
00:15:17,861 --> 00:15:22,665
[SPEAKER_07]: Come over and basically speak the pledge for Method Little League.

129
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:23,946
[SPEAKER_01]: I love its country.

130
00:15:23,966 --> 00:15:26,388
[SPEAKER_01]: I respect its laws.

131
00:15:26,528 --> 00:15:28,250
[SPEAKER_01]: I will play fair and strive to win.

132
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:30,592
[SPEAKER_01]: But win or lose, I will always do my best.

133
00:15:31,192 --> 00:15:31,753
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice job.

134
00:15:31,793 --> 00:15:32,233
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice job.

135
00:15:33,154 --> 00:15:33,654
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice job.

136
00:15:33,694 --> 00:15:34,115
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice job.

137
00:15:37,118 --> 00:15:40,699
[SPEAKER_07]: And what we also do, too, is we have a coach's pledge.

138
00:15:41,139 --> 00:15:43,059
[SPEAKER_07]: It was something that we put in back in 2013.

139
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:47,980
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to have Joe Salera read it, so I'm going to bring him out right now and have him read it.

140
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,260
[SPEAKER_07]: So, Joe, why don't you come out and read this?

141
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:52,661
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, Joe.

142
00:15:52,681 --> 00:15:53,261
[SPEAKER_07]: Great fun.

143
00:15:53,281 --> 00:15:53,701
[SPEAKER_07]: We love that.

144
00:15:57,561 --> 00:15:58,782
[SPEAKER_00]: Medford Little League culture.

145
00:15:58,882 --> 00:15:59,162
[SPEAKER_00]: Louder.

146
00:15:59,882 --> 00:16:02,562
[SPEAKER_00]: One, coaching is always a privilege.

147
00:16:03,522 --> 00:16:06,483
[SPEAKER_00]: We are coaching for life, not for one game or one season.

148
00:16:07,572 --> 00:16:12,355
[SPEAKER_00]: I am coaching the top of the batting order, the bottom of the batting order, and the bench.

149
00:16:12,635 --> 00:16:14,396
[SPEAKER_00]: Every player should spend time on each.

150
00:16:15,477 --> 00:16:17,819
[SPEAKER_00]: I will keep the great game fun for all players.

151
00:16:18,717 --> 00:16:24,322
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Little League, and these are young people that will have an impact on good or bad.

152
00:16:25,163 --> 00:16:27,866
[SPEAKER_00]: I am responsible for the team and league cultures.

153
00:16:28,567 --> 00:16:33,612
[SPEAKER_00]: I will coach the way I would want my child coached if I was watching from the stands.

154
00:16:34,472 --> 00:16:39,938
[SPEAKER_00]: I will emphasize effort, learning, and improving, and bouncing back from mistakes.

155
00:16:43,017 --> 00:16:46,120
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all things in the player's control.

156
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:50,524
[SPEAKER_00]: By focusing on these things, we reduce anxiety, increase confidence.

157
00:16:51,685 --> 00:16:58,712
[SPEAKER_00]: Contrast these with focusing on results, compassion to others, or the mistakes are not okay.

158
00:17:00,907 --> 00:17:03,009
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all out of the players' control.

159
00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:10,074
[SPEAKER_00]: I will set a culture of respect for rules, opponents, officials, teammates, and self-roots.

160
00:17:10,855 --> 00:17:12,436
[SPEAKER_00]: I will look for teachable moments.

161
00:17:13,057 --> 00:17:28,730
[SPEAKER_00]: I will keep my players emotionally, emotional tanks filled, look for opportunities to give truthful, specific encouragement, expressing appreciation, listening, exhibiting positive body language.

162
00:17:29,949 --> 00:17:40,600
[SPEAKER_00]: Contrast to criticizing, correcting, sarcasm, ignoring, ex-a-bigot, ex-a-visiting, negative body language.

163
00:17:42,943 --> 00:17:47,868
[SPEAKER_00]: Note points 8, 9, and 10 are adapted from Positive Coaching Alliance materials.

164
00:17:49,477 --> 00:18:03,009
[SPEAKER_07]: Tufts University and the Positive Coaching Alliance, we work with them pretty closely in terms of training the coaches for just basically working with kids and just making sure they have access and opportunities to positive reinforcements.

165
00:18:03,389 --> 00:18:09,835
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's one of the opportunities that we're trying to provide as a community for the kids in MedFed and the MedFed Little League program.

166
00:18:10,295 --> 00:18:14,763
[SPEAKER_07]: And what I'd like to do is just provide this opportunity for Mayor Burke to come up and just have to say a couple of words.

167
00:18:15,163 --> 00:18:21,033
[SPEAKER_07]: We've been partnering with her with the Community Preservation Act in order to do some reservations, some recreation programs.

168
00:18:21,394 --> 00:18:23,878
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'll just give her an opportunity to say hello.

169
00:18:28,672 --> 00:18:30,513
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you everyone for being here today.

170
00:18:30,773 --> 00:18:34,115
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a great sight out there seeing this rainbow of colors in our field.

171
00:18:34,615 --> 00:18:36,957
[SPEAKER_05]: And as Tyler said, always do your best.

172
00:18:37,017 --> 00:18:37,977
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all that matters.

173
00:18:38,057 --> 00:18:41,880
[SPEAKER_05]: Always just do the best you can and be a great teammate because it's so important.

174
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:45,742
[SPEAKER_05]: You learn these lessons now and they carry through your entire life.

175
00:18:46,162 --> 00:18:54,651
[SPEAKER_05]: So to all the parents that are helping out and the parents that are at home throwing balls and tape balls and everything else, thank you so much for being a part of this great community.

176
00:18:54,871 --> 00:18:56,272
[SPEAKER_05]: Have fun, play ball!

177
00:19:00,152 --> 00:19:03,873
[SPEAKER_07]: So what we're going to do now is we're going to ask the kids to come up with their gloves.

178
00:19:03,933 --> 00:19:11,494
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to ask, we have City Council Michael Mox, City Council John Falco, and we have Mia Mustone, who's also a coach.

179
00:19:11,514 --> 00:19:14,055
[SPEAKER_07]: Congratulations, Mia, for stepping up.

180
00:19:14,475 --> 00:19:15,395
[SPEAKER_07]: Johnny's been a coach.

181
00:19:15,435 --> 00:19:17,396
[SPEAKER_07]: Michael Mox has been a coach in this program.

182
00:19:17,676 --> 00:19:19,016
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's been a great opportunity.

183
00:19:19,716 --> 00:19:23,157
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have Mayor Burke and the rest of the elected officials.

184
00:19:23,177 --> 00:19:24,657
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll have you step out in the mound here.

185
00:19:25,397 --> 00:19:27,438
[SPEAKER_07]: The count of three, take your time.

186
00:19:28,812 --> 00:19:29,493
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, one at a time.

187
00:19:29,533 --> 00:19:30,433
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll do one at a time.

188
00:19:30,733 --> 00:19:31,914
[SPEAKER_07]: Maya Firth will go first.

189
00:19:36,357 --> 00:19:36,958
[SPEAKER_02]: Put your glove up.

190
00:19:37,038 --> 00:19:37,618
[SPEAKER_02]: Put your glove up.

191
00:19:41,741 --> 00:19:44,263
[SPEAKER_10]: Michael Ma.

192
00:20:01,689 --> 00:20:03,029
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice job, nice job.

193
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:14,612
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey John Tucker.

194
00:20:18,953 --> 00:20:21,233
