Hi, Danielle.

13
00:00:47,817 --> 00:00:48,537
Zach Behrs.

14
00:00:48,857 --> 00:00:51,258
I'm the city council president here in Medford.

15
00:00:51,278 --> 00:00:52,878
He, him pronouns.

16
00:00:53,959 --> 00:00:57,300
And the restaurant question I've answered many times.

17
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:05,022
I usually talk about Colleen's, but lately, and I still love Colleen's, I've been getting the Catania sandwich at Deep Cuts.

18
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:05,950
Hmm.

19
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:07,051
Nice.

20
00:01:07,091 --> 00:01:07,371
Thank you.

21
00:01:07,391 --> 00:01:13,073
Well, you beat me to it the question, but thank you for saving us some time because it's your favorite.

22
00:01:13,113 --> 00:01:17,114
And we, I recently took my son to the pinball part of, of deep cuts, which is really fun.

23
00:01:17,775 --> 00:01:18,775
Um, okay.

24
00:01:18,795 --> 00:01:25,498
So mostly what we're talking about today is not your, um, reelection campaign, but were you talking about last week?

25
00:01:25,858 --> 00:01:30,379
Um, you made a statement at, uh, was it the zone?

26
00:01:30,399 --> 00:01:30,840
What was it?

27
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,060
The.

28
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,622
Planning and Permitting Committee of the City Council.

29
00:01:35,002 --> 00:01:35,322
Perfect.

30
00:01:35,362 --> 00:01:36,683
Planning and Permitting Committee.

31
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:41,307
About zoning, because it sounds like there's been a lot of talk about zoning.

32
00:01:41,327 --> 00:01:47,251
And so I'm wondering maybe you could start just by letting us know why you chose to make that statement at the time you did.

33
00:01:48,491 --> 00:01:57,738
Yeah, so we have been in Medford, you know, for the past several years going through some big conversations about the future of our city.

34
00:01:58,681 --> 00:02:14,564
what we want growth and development to look like, creating the city's first ever comprehensive plan, and, you know, for the past five years, and especially the last 18 months in this phase, working on a citywide rezoning effort, and been really excited to work on it.

35
00:02:14,825 --> 00:02:19,285
Last election, I talked about it a lot in my campaign.

36
00:02:19,946 --> 00:02:20,906
We've talked about it in

37
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:38,286
probably over 40-45 council meetings this term, and one of the proposals for the residential districts here in the city, so a lot of our neighborhoods, that has been under discussion, especially over the last six months, and

38
00:02:40,228 --> 00:02:50,996
In May or so, the Community Development Board published some recommendations for changing the council's original proposal for the residential districts.

39
00:02:51,396 --> 00:03:06,808
And I think there was a lot of uproar and folks who felt that those recommended changes from the Community Development Board went further than they were comfortable with in terms of what could potentially be allowed in some of our neighborhoods.

40
00:03:07,288 --> 00:03:08,830
So we've seen really since May,

41
00:03:09,674 --> 00:03:28,717
A lot of discussion about that residential zoning proposal, not being something that residents some residents here want to see other residents are very supportive of it I think one of the reasons that the CD board made its recommendations is that there are a lot of residents talking about the need for more housing, because of the housing crisis that we're in.

42
00:03:29,962 --> 00:03:44,612
But I just felt that, especially over the last two months, the conversation that we were having was not as productive as it needs to be to get this work done well, and that there were a lot of folks who

43
00:03:46,673 --> 00:04:00,792
wanted the process to continue at the same pace it was continuing in, and I really respect that, but I think taking another five or six months and refocusing the conversation over the original proposal that the council put out

44
00:04:01,565 --> 00:04:17,433
was a better foundation for making sure that folks who had good faith questions and concerns and comments could be heard and that we had more time to get more resources from the mayor's office to help communicate this out a little bit better.

45
00:04:17,753 --> 00:04:19,714
So that's why I put it forward.

46
00:04:19,734 --> 00:04:26,297
I just felt that especially the community development board meeting in July that

47
00:04:28,947 --> 00:04:43,665
that that meeting just wasn't going to be, it was a reflection of a process that had become not productive towards achieving the goals that I think a lot of people in this community share about where we should go as a city in terms of development and growth.

48
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:44,305
Yeah.

49
00:04:45,096 --> 00:04:52,318
And I mean, I have to say that it seemed to me, at least, it's like a sort of a confusing topic.

50
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:57,719
And it sounds like the zoning was what's proposed is not necessarily like uniform throughout the city.

51
00:04:58,619 --> 00:05:07,501
But one of the things that was concerning to me was like, this like text message survey that I got that was actually named you.

52
00:05:07,521 --> 00:05:10,002
And your name is spelled incorrectly.

53
00:05:10,042 --> 00:05:10,162
But

54
00:05:10,662 --> 00:05:33,622
it like, did it did it made some like pretty extreme, like, it poses a questions that didn't seem like they were based in fact and I'm wondering if there's like example was that one of the proposals for changing zoning was to eliminate single occupancy, or like single family homes in Medford which felt like

55
00:05:34,185 --> 00:05:49,561
I don't believe that would be true or that I don't, I don't think, I don't know how, why I would, would believe that would be true, but it's, I'm wondering if like some of the intention around making your statement was like to slow things down, but also to maybe make space for some like myth busting.

56
00:05:49,581 --> 00:05:53,145
So I wonder if there's any of that that you want to speak to.

57
00:05:54,577 --> 00:06:02,500
Yeah, I mean, the first myth to bust is zoning can't make anyone do anything that they don't want to do with their property.

58
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:10,443
So, you know, there will be single family homes here in Menford for forever, I would assume, as long as Menford exists.

59
00:06:12,044 --> 00:06:17,406
But, and, you know, there was not a proposal to end even the zoning to allow single family.

60
00:06:17,566 --> 00:06:19,107
So that's misinformation.

61
00:06:19,267 --> 00:06:21,188
And I think, you know, your point is really well taken.

62
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:23,709
Zoning is complex.

63
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:33,438
It is a law that affects a major part of development and growth, but it doesn't make the choices about how a community develops and grows by itself.

64
00:06:35,053 --> 00:06:42,296
individual people do that, what people want to do with the properties that they own, who they sell their properties to.

65
00:06:42,316 --> 00:06:49,258
We have a zoning code right now that doesn't hold developers to account nearly as much as it needs to.

66
00:06:50,139 --> 00:06:53,740
And, you know, I think just getting that point across is really important.

67
00:06:54,524 --> 00:07:03,367
There are certainly some folks in the city who don't support the comprehensive plan don't want to see change in our community.

68
00:07:04,107 --> 00:07:07,388
But I think the reality is changes happening no matter what.

69
00:07:08,148 --> 00:07:12,230
And we need to talk about and have a plan for and then implement that plan for.

70
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:17,035
making sure that that change best fits what our goals are as a community.

71
00:07:17,055 --> 00:07:29,529
I think our comprehensive plan that was came out in 2023 that you know was, I was part of the steering committee but it, you know, as an effort of the mayor's office talks about how we need more growth for a lot of reasons.

72
00:07:32,212 --> 00:07:33,234
More affordable housing.

73
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:45,306
more market rate housing to keep the pressure off of the existing housing that we have now, better mixed use corridors and squares, more walkable neighborhoods, a million things.

74
00:07:45,886 --> 00:07:50,909
And zoning is a piece of how we get to that future that we want to see.

75
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:50,989
And

76
00:07:55,473 --> 00:08:09,005
I just have really felt that because zoning is complicated, it has been easy and too easy, especially because we haven't had the resources and collaboration on the city side to put out enough good communications with good information.

77
00:08:09,886 --> 00:08:14,950
It's been easy for people to kind of twist the zoning effort for their own political purposes.

78
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:17,052
I don't think most people are doing that.

79
00:08:17,232 --> 00:08:18,213
Most people I've talked to.

80
00:08:19,114 --> 00:08:41,257
say this is complicated i want to understand it better or i generally support the vision of where we're going but i think there are some issues with the specifics a lot of people i've talked to have said um the city council proposal for residential zoning from march makes a lot more sense than the suggested recommended changes that came through the community development board in may so

81
00:08:42,618 --> 00:09:08,888
I think with a little more time and some more resources appropriated by the mayor's office, it will, and focusing the conversation around what the council actually proposed, not the kind of more density proposal from the community development board, doing all three of those things will really help us to have the conversation that we need to have as a community and get this done in a timely fashion.

82
00:09:08,928 --> 00:09:11,209
Because the other piece of this is that

83
00:09:12,701 --> 00:09:17,524
Medford in so many ways has not seen the action that it's needed to see over the last 30 and 40 years.

84
00:09:17,584 --> 00:09:19,725
Things have been allowed to stagnate and fall apart.

85
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:25,068
And we don't want to be in a position where we need another override to prevent teacher layoffs.

86
00:09:25,809 --> 00:09:36,095
We want growth in a smart and significant way to let us also invest in our city services, our public schools,

87
00:09:37,096 --> 00:09:42,100
and make sure that the city can do what it needs to do to provide for its residents.

88
00:09:42,201 --> 00:09:44,483
So it's just so important that we get this done.

89
00:09:45,344 --> 00:10:00,098
And I felt it was essential that we don't allow the process to get in the way of the substance and let people, a small number of people who want to sabotage this, be able to say that the process wasn't good enough.

90
00:10:01,593 --> 00:10:23,704
That's what I'm hoping to see over the next year to 18 months is that we can complete and secure the progress of this project by updating our zoning ordinance and making sure that folks who have some concerns right now are able to voice those and we get a good product at the end of the process as well.

91
00:10:24,004 --> 00:10:25,405
Even if everyone's not going to agree,

92
00:10:26,105 --> 00:10:32,989
I think people most want to see that we've had voices heard that have good faith concerns.

93
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:35,330
Thank you.

94
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:39,253
So I am trying to understand a little bit about what you're explaining.

95
00:10:39,813 --> 00:10:45,976
So the City Council proposed a zoning ordinance and then the Community Development Board also had a say.

96
00:10:46,256 --> 00:10:48,238
Who gets the final say?

97
00:10:48,278 --> 00:10:52,240
Is it something that people vote on as a community or how does that work?

98
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:53,450
Sure.

99
00:10:53,530 --> 00:11:02,280
So the way zoning works under the state law is in cities, the city council has the authority to amend zoning.

100
00:11:03,521 --> 00:11:06,684
In towns, it's town meeting, but we're a city, so it's a city council.

101
00:11:07,525 --> 00:11:10,569
And communities have these groups called planning boards.

102
00:11:10,729 --> 00:11:13,151
In Medford, our planning board is called the Community Development Board.

103
00:11:13,832 --> 00:11:19,814
And any zoning change goes to them so that they can review it, compare it to the city's plans.

104
00:11:19,894 --> 00:11:26,156
For example, our comprehensive plan, our climate plan, our housing plan, and some of our different plans for different parts of the city.

105
00:11:26,176 --> 00:11:33,899
And they can make recommendations back to the city council and say, you know, we reviewed your proposal and we recommend that you change it in this way.

106
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:41,021
And then the city council can review those recommendations and it can adopt them or adopt some of them.

107
00:11:41,741 --> 00:11:43,442
And then the zoning ordinance becomes law.

108
00:11:44,487 --> 00:11:53,920
Right now, this process this rezoning project, which is in its kind of third phase, or at least second phase with the council.

109
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:58,285
There are a number of proposals around zoning so.

110
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:03,741
Um, it's not just 1 proposal around rezoning of the whole city.

111
00:12:03,801 --> 00:12:07,523
There's a residential districts proposal for residential neighborhoods.

112
00:12:07,723 --> 00:12:11,345
There are proposals for Medford square West Medford square.

113
00:12:11,905 --> 00:12:13,806
Some of our main commercial corridors.

114
00:12:14,446 --> 00:12:18,548
We already approved the mystic Avenue corridor and the Salem street corridor.

115
00:12:19,288 --> 00:12:23,911
And then there are some other proposals as well around parking, transportation management.

116
00:12:24,491 --> 00:12:30,474
We approved a new green score to make all new developments a lot more environmentally friendly.

117
00:12:31,094 --> 00:12:40,419
There's a private tree zoning ordinance that we're looking at to try to protect trees on private property when someone comes in to redevelop a property or expand a home.

118
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:43,081
So there's a lot of different proposals.

119
00:12:43,181 --> 00:12:47,343
The main thing that has been the subject of a lot of debate

120
00:12:48,198 --> 00:12:54,161
And misinformation over the last couple of months is the residential districts.

121
00:12:54,581 --> 00:12:56,982
So proposals for a lot of our neighborhoods.

122
00:12:58,663 --> 00:13:03,505
That are not on our main drags main streets and avenues and squares.

123
00:13:05,026 --> 00:13:08,708
Yeah, what are some of those, like, what, like, what's some of the misinformation that's been out there?

124
00:13:09,448 --> 00:13:09,869
Sure.

125
00:13:09,909 --> 00:13:10,169
Yeah.

126
00:13:10,229 --> 00:13:15,994
I mean, you know, people have said they want to put six story apartment buildings in the middle of single family neighborhoods.

127
00:13:16,134 --> 00:13:22,520
And, you know, they want to allow, you know, completely destroy and single family housing forever.

128
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,763
And, you know, just a lot of things that are just completely not true.

129
00:13:27,084 --> 00:13:29,947
The main thing about the residential proposal from the council

130
00:13:30,888 --> 00:13:36,557
Is increasing the allowable what I call increment incremental density.

131
00:13:36,697 --> 00:13:41,264
So, um, saying if there's places right now that allow a 2 family.

132
00:13:43,473 --> 00:13:59,044
Can we allow for three family as long as they meet all of the other requirements, parking requirements setbacks, open space, something we're implementing for the first time ever is actually open space requirements for a lot of the residential neighborhoods right now and people I'm sure have seen it.

133
00:13:59,744 --> 00:14:04,287
Someone can come in by a house cut down every tree pave the entire lot.

134
00:14:05,628 --> 00:14:09,391
That's something that would never be allowed again under the new zoning if it were to pass.

135
00:14:09,512 --> 00:14:16,558
So one of the main things about the new zoning is, yes, say, can we allow a little bit more housing in each of our neighborhoods?

136
00:14:18,239 --> 00:14:23,444
And in some places, it's a little more significant than others because of some unique characteristics.

137
00:14:23,484 --> 00:14:27,587
This plan really is tailored to our neighborhoods and our neighborhoods are different.

138
00:14:28,763 --> 00:14:56,993
uh it's tailored you know there's some more increase around the new green line stations a little bit more change around the west menford commuter rail station um so you know it's not it is neighborhood specific and addressing you know the different characteristics uh but this whole concept of kind of squares corridors and neighborhoods that came out of the comprehensive plan um there's a map in the 2023 medford comprehensive plan that talks about this and that was the basis of

139
00:14:57,693 --> 00:15:18,570
About six to nine months of studies and analysis that we did, the Innis Associates zoning consultants team and zoning lawyers, they did a bunch of analysis from January 2024 to about September of 2024 based on the comprehensive plan and the climate plan and the housing plan to come up with proposals.

140
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:22,972
essentially two proposals, a residential framework and a commercial framework.

141
00:15:23,692 --> 00:15:26,653
So what do our mixed use corridors and squares look like?

142
00:15:26,913 --> 00:15:29,234
And then what do our more residential neighborhoods look like?

143
00:15:29,574 --> 00:15:39,238
And that was the starting point for the zoning amendments that we've been working on for for about a year, plus the studies from last January to June.

144
00:15:39,838 --> 00:15:44,940
And then, of course, the four years of other planning and zoning conversations we were having before that.

145
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:49,035
I feel like when I started this podcast in 2021, we were talking about zoning.

146
00:15:50,156 --> 00:15:52,839
I'm sure some things have changed, but let me give you an example.

147
00:15:52,979 --> 00:16:04,072
On my street, in the Fulton Heights, we've had a bunch of families age out of their properties, whatever that means, and then

148
00:16:05,013 --> 00:16:06,014
they go out for sale.

149
00:16:06,054 --> 00:16:09,916
We had a house like two doors down that this man was like almost 100 years old.

150
00:16:09,956 --> 00:16:11,076
His family, he lived there forever.

151
00:16:11,536 --> 00:16:12,417
It was like a triple lot.

152
00:16:12,817 --> 00:16:15,078
The house got sold after he died.

153
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:19,781
They knocked down his house, built, you know, divided the property.

154
00:16:19,821 --> 00:16:24,903
So they built two giant homes on them that I'm sure will be on there that I think will be like over a million dollars.

155
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:29,746
And so it sounds like the zoning could make it so that if somebody wanted to build like

156
00:16:30,974 --> 00:16:35,138
like three family homes on that property they could, which would be great.

157
00:16:35,358 --> 00:16:54,796
And well, I'm wondering if it's, it sounds like it's, they're making allowances for these things, but is there any sort of incentive for developers to like create those like, you know, more units of housing per property or, because I, you know, I feel like they're, they're mostly driven by how much they can make off selling these properties.

158
00:16:56,260 --> 00:17:03,610
Well, I think that's actually a really great example and the Fulton Heights is tough because of private ways and because of development on wetlands and because of the hills.

159
00:17:04,271 --> 00:17:07,175
So there's, you know, some concerns about doing quite as much there.

160
00:17:07,576 --> 00:17:13,284
I think we could do more, maybe a little bit than what was proposed, but some of the planners feel differently.

161
00:17:14,387 --> 00:17:19,448
But I think that's actually a really great example across the board of how zoning is broken right now.

162
00:17:20,269 --> 00:17:35,973
Right now, land is so valuable and the profit incentive is so strong that it makes sense for a developer to come in and whether it's subdivide a large lot and build two large single family homes or more, or even take down or renovate one single family home

163
00:17:36,713 --> 00:17:43,195
and make a 1,500-foot starter home into a 3,000-square-foot McMansion, right?

164
00:17:43,215 --> 00:17:45,075
Our zoning's incentivizing that right now.

165
00:17:45,756 --> 00:17:50,997
So we're getting really bad outcomes no matter what because of the profit incentive.

166
00:17:51,517 --> 00:17:54,858
And the idea of the zoning is to change those incentives, right?

167
00:17:57,739 --> 00:18:04,701
You know, the example you had in some parts of the city, it might be a little bit different right now in the Heights because of what I said,

168
00:18:06,368 --> 00:18:13,513
What we'd want to see is probably two somewhat more modest structures that maybe had two two two families, right?

169
00:18:14,214 --> 00:18:16,015
Because you could house more people.

170
00:18:16,756 --> 00:18:19,097
The units would be of a lower cost, right?

171
00:18:19,438 --> 00:18:27,944
If you, you know, if it was a two family and each unit was 750,000 versus a giant single family at 1.5 million, that's a lot more accessible.

172
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:33,046
You know, it's not accessible for a lot of people, but it's a lot better than a million and a half dollar McMansion, right?

173
00:18:33,606 --> 00:18:36,086
So that's one of the big things the zoning is trying to say.

174
00:18:36,627 --> 00:18:41,488
Developers are already coming in, but our zoning is incentivizing some pretty bad outcomes.

175
00:18:42,949 --> 00:18:47,930
We also have a patchwork zoning where we want to hold, you know, we aren't holding developers to account right now, right?

176
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:52,232
Like, this council is trying to update the development linkage fees for the first time in 35 years.

177
00:18:53,532 --> 00:18:55,433
to get developers to pay their fair share.

178
00:18:56,194 --> 00:18:58,355
We don't want this pave over thing.

179
00:18:58,415 --> 00:19:00,056
We need an open space minimum.

180
00:19:00,076 --> 00:19:01,437
We want to protect trees.

181
00:19:01,978 --> 00:19:14,246
And we want to say, if the land's already so valuable that the developers are going to do things and build new things anyway, how do we make those things as good as they can be for our community's goals?

182
00:19:14,606 --> 00:19:18,188
How can we say we'd rather have a two family or a three family

183
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:25,424
with somewhat more affordable apartments or condos rather than a giant McMansion, right?

184
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:27,045
It's not perfect.

185
00:19:27,426 --> 00:19:36,572
I have a lot of, you know, I don't think that the market is the only way or even entirely a way to solve the housing crisis, right?

186
00:19:36,992 --> 00:19:43,417
But right now, our city's land use and zoning policies are so out of whack that we're actually making things worse.

187
00:19:44,037 --> 00:19:46,199
So that's one of the big initiatives here.

188
00:19:48,178 --> 00:20:00,913
How do we get property owners, developers more accountable and have the growth that is going to happen no matter what be more targeted towards the goals that we want to see our community meet?

189
00:20:02,351 --> 00:20:02,971
Okay, thank you.

190
00:20:03,031 --> 00:20:05,013
And that's helpful to hear.

191
00:20:05,033 --> 00:20:13,719
The other question that I have, something that I've seen people talking about is increasing density of neighborhoods.

192
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:19,264
Will that increase number of students in school and how would that be considered?

193
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:23,247
Are there any concerns there of some of our schools being already pretty full?

194
00:20:24,463 --> 00:20:25,964
Yeah, so there's a couple things there.

195
00:20:26,145 --> 00:20:37,815
One is a non-development, non-zoning related question at all, which is we have two elementary schools that are near capacity, one that's probably where it should be, and one that's under capacity.

196
00:20:38,475 --> 00:20:41,538
And the schools are working on a plan to address that.

197
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:44,481
So there is space in our elementary schools right now.

198
00:20:44,521 --> 00:20:45,722
It's just not well distributed.

199
00:20:45,982 --> 00:20:47,123
And that needs to be fixed.

200
00:20:47,503 --> 00:20:48,604
That's not a zoning problem.

201
00:20:49,485 --> 00:20:55,031
This bigger question is around what does it mean if more people live here?

202
00:20:55,052 --> 00:20:58,315
And I think that's a real question.

203
00:20:58,996 --> 00:21:09,929
You know, one thing there's a lot of information on, Vice Chair of the School Committee Jenny Graham put out a good note on this around the Mass School Building Authority analysis for the new high school.

204
00:21:11,802 --> 00:21:19,859
You know, right now, because of demographics, we've seen declining enrollments here in Medford, you know, our high school was built in the 70s in the 60s for.

205
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:23,039
4,000 people.

206
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,562
It has about 1,400 in it right now.

207
00:21:26,203 --> 00:21:29,267
So we've seen declining enrollments.

208
00:21:29,427 --> 00:21:31,069
One piece of that is demographic trends.

209
00:21:31,269 --> 00:21:41,341
Another piece of that is that all of the studies from the Metro Area Planning Council and other social science experts around housing, the Citizens Housing and Policy Alliance,

210
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:48,413
they show that actually adding new housing alone doesn't mean more students in our schools.

211
00:21:48,894 --> 00:21:55,882
The thing that actually adds the most students in our schools is when we add more affordable housing because that's the biggest need.

212
00:21:56,932 --> 00:22:02,676
What we're seeing right now is, and it's one of the things that's driving this larger thing, declining household sizes.

213
00:22:04,157 --> 00:22:07,420
There's fewer people living in the same size structures.

214
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:11,142
We used to have almost 70,000 people here in Medford.

215
00:22:11,162 --> 00:22:12,563
We're down to about 60 now.

216
00:22:12,823 --> 00:22:22,270
We actually had fewer houses at the time, and it's because there's a lot more one, two, three, four-person households, where in the past you used to have four, five, six, seven-person households.

217
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:24,292
A lot of structures

218
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:27,834
with four bedrooms and only two people living in them, right?

219
00:22:27,874 --> 00:22:30,035
Like these things have been really impactful.

220
00:22:30,115 --> 00:22:35,058
So building more affordable housing will have an impact.

221
00:22:35,398 --> 00:22:42,683
But the other thing is that there's going to be, as the new high school process moves forward, we were able to build in

222
00:22:43,557 --> 00:22:53,222
a little more assumption for some growth in there, and then also to move the entire pre-K system to the new high school, and that would free up space in our elementary schools as well.

223
00:22:53,362 --> 00:23:05,268
So realistically, you know, in the short term, the 5-, 10- to 15-year term, most of the data and studies that I've seen indicate that

224
00:23:06,466 --> 00:23:12,011
new residents and new housing is not going to be a driving factor in our school population.

225
00:23:13,272 --> 00:23:23,060
And, you know, if in 5, 10, and 15 years we're in a different position, then we have to start having a conversation about what it looks like to expand an elementary school or renovate one.

226
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,842
And that's the conversations that cities and towns have all the time.

227
00:23:27,204 --> 00:23:41,232
This city, as is true of many of the things, made a very colossal mistake 25 years ago and sold off all of the old schools for a dime, not a dollar.

228
00:23:42,753 --> 00:23:48,256
And that was because we wanted to save some money back then, and it was penny wise and pound foolish.

229
00:23:48,376 --> 00:23:53,579
If the city still owned those properties today, we'd have a lot more ability to have conversations about a lot of things.

230
00:23:54,940 --> 00:24:06,703
about community centers, about youth centers, about after school, about expanding an elementary school, about pre-K programs, about recreation, about support for youth with disabilities.

231
00:24:06,763 --> 00:24:10,423
I mean, this is what we're trying to fix, right?

232
00:24:10,443 --> 00:24:15,945
We're trying to fix decades of neglect and missed opportunities and bad choices.

233
00:24:17,973 --> 00:24:24,854
That's going to continue to be the conversation we have as a city because it takes decades to correct the mistakes of decades past.

234
00:24:26,211 --> 00:24:27,471
Yeah, well, and I appreciate that.

235
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:38,695
I mean, I think some of the ways that the conversation has been framed is like being, you know, being sort of short-sighted and what you're, the way you're describing, it's like, it sounds like you are kind of thinking about the long-term future of the city.

236
00:24:38,715 --> 00:24:47,438
And it sounds like if we reached a capacity in our elementary schools, it would mean that our population had increased and hopefully some of our tax dollars increase as well.

237
00:24:47,778 --> 00:24:50,839
That would help us fund some of those expansions if we needed them.

238
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:52,480
Yes, absolutely.

239
00:24:52,979 --> 00:24:53,179
Yeah.

240
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,740
Well, thank you.

241
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:58,543
Is there anything else that any other points that we haven't talked about that you want to make sure we do?

242
00:24:59,444 --> 00:25:04,428
Yeah, I just really want to reiterate the importance of why we're doing this.

243
00:25:06,229 --> 00:25:11,133
We need a Medford that is growing in a smart and significant way.

244
00:25:12,412 --> 00:25:21,014
we have proposals before us that they're not the end, they're not the final product, but they are a really good foundation for having these conversations.

245
00:25:22,274 --> 00:25:37,818
And I think over the next few months, we're going to see a lot of good conversations, some disagreements, but especially I think being able to reach each other across some differences that we may have and better understand

246
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:47,434
what's being proposed, make some of the tweaks and changes based on some folks, you know, questions and some things that need to be considered.

247
00:25:47,694 --> 00:25:55,038
And we're going to come out of this with a strong zoning ordinance that will set Medford up for success for the next 15 to 20 years.

248
00:25:55,358 --> 00:25:58,240
And I'm really excited about that.

249
00:25:59,200 --> 00:25:59,920
It sounds exciting.

250
00:26:00,721 --> 00:26:01,481
Yeah, no, thank you.

251
00:26:01,501 --> 00:26:05,403
I think this really helps to kind of clarify some of the questions that I had.

252
00:26:05,423 --> 00:26:07,264
And hopefully it's helpful for other folks as well.

253
00:26:08,555 --> 00:26:08,695
Yeah.

254
00:26:09,315 --> 00:26:09,976
Thanks, Danielle.

255
00:26:10,076 --> 00:26:12,537
And I mean, that's really why I gave the address that I gave.

256
00:26:15,418 --> 00:26:27,043
I think we've had a lot of good conversations and we need to, you know, I felt the need to step up and show some leadership because it's really important to get this done the right way.

257
00:26:27,995 --> 00:26:36,557
Yeah, and it sounds like, you know, I think that it's easy to watch, kind of easy to see, like what happens on social media, for example, when people start chatting about these things.

258
00:26:36,597 --> 00:26:43,978
And there's a lot of I think that making this speech and it sounds like people can find it on your website and also on the city website, maybe through the.

259
00:26:45,419 --> 00:26:51,300
You can find it through Medford TV, Medford Community Media, and then also on my website, Zach Barris dot com.

260
00:26:52,174 --> 00:27:01,457
Yeah, that's something a great way for people to be able to sort of hopefully dispel some of the misinformation that they're hearing and just get like a clear answer from you as well.

261
00:27:01,537 --> 00:27:02,317
So thank you.

262
00:27:02,717 --> 00:27:08,719
And if it's if folks prefer to read rather than to watch, I'd recommend going to ZachBears.com.

263
00:27:08,779 --> 00:27:15,301
The full remarks are there and and probably a shortcut link to a video too.

264
00:27:15,921 --> 00:27:18,942
So you don't have to watch the introduction to the meeting either.

265
00:27:20,861 --> 00:27:22,146
All right, Zach, well, thank you so much.

266
00:27:22,949 --> 00:27:23,350
