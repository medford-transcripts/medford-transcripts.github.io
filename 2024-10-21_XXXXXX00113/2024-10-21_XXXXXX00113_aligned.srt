So two things I love about Medford.

129
00:13:19,471 --> 00:13:26,400
I think Medford has really underrated food from our Italian food, our Chinese food, everything in the square.

130
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:29,925
I think it's really underrated and I've been trying to get all my friends to come in.

131
00:13:29,945 --> 00:13:34,772
I think one like bigger picture thing I love about Medford is

132
00:13:35,312 --> 00:13:38,753
I think we really walk the walk when it comes to what we say.

133
