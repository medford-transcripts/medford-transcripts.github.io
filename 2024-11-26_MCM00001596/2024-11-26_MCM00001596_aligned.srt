1
00:00:00,651 --> 00:00:05,035
Do we want to start with just and have the guests here introduce themselves?

2
00:00:05,916 --> 00:00:06,176
Yes.

3
00:00:15,243 --> 00:00:18,205
Hello, my name is Trey winter.

4
00:00:18,446 --> 00:00:18,986
I am a 15.

5
00:00:33,585 --> 00:00:37,427
Oops, is that my Wi-Fi that's having an issue?

6
00:00:37,547 --> 00:00:38,908
I think it's strange.

7
00:00:39,028 --> 00:00:50,955
I'm very interested in climate issue and I am just here.

8
00:01:00,267 --> 00:01:08,052
OK, I'm just chatting to him that I think he's having Wi-Fi issues and asking if he wants to introduce himself in the chat.

9
00:01:16,578 --> 00:01:17,659
Margaret, would you like to?

10
00:01:18,919 --> 00:01:19,100
Sure.

11
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,540
Hi, my name is Margaret.

12
00:01:21,301 --> 00:01:23,202
I'm sorry, I don't have a video.

13
00:01:23,262 --> 00:01:24,343
I thought I would, but I don't.

14
00:01:24,503 --> 00:01:25,164
So here I am.

15
00:01:27,902 --> 00:01:31,905
Let's see, I bought a house in Medford about two years ago.

16
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:36,929
And I have been living in the Boston area for about 12.

17
00:01:39,271 --> 00:01:48,438
In my professional life, I work in a variety of environmental science and policy types of projects.

18
00:01:48,738 --> 00:01:56,465
And so I'm just looking for ways to bring my, you know, to expand out

19
00:01:57,828 --> 00:02:01,411
to something like really relevant and local.

20
00:02:02,091 --> 00:02:02,351
Thanks.

21
00:02:04,373 --> 00:02:04,813
That's great.

22
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:05,914
What's your last name, Margaret?

23
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:08,916
K-U-R-T-H.

24
00:02:14,179 --> 00:02:24,347
And I see in the chat that Trey says his name is Trey Winter, 15 year Medford resident and a scientist very interested in climate issues.

25
00:02:24,407 --> 00:02:26,288
Thank you for joining Margaret and Trey.

26
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:57,834
Do we want to continue with some of the administrative parts?

27
00:02:58,214 --> 00:02:58,454
Yes.

28
00:02:58,914 --> 00:03:02,576
We can't do the minutes from the September meeting yet.

29
00:03:03,677 --> 00:03:11,341
So we will wait till we have, we either have a quorum here or we just wait till the next meeting.

30
00:03:12,501 --> 00:03:19,165
But I wanted to talk about when the next meetings would be just to make sure that it worked for everybody.

31
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:27,133
I think right now they're on the calendar for November 18th and December 16th.

32
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:30,216
That's so perfect for me.

33
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,181
Charbel, do those work for you?

34
00:03:37,201 --> 00:03:41,425
Those will be on the Monday?

35
00:03:42,325 --> 00:03:42,606
Yes.

36
00:03:42,746 --> 00:03:43,867
At this time.

37
00:03:43,947 --> 00:03:46,249
Yeah, it should work.

38
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:50,152
And should we do them Zoom or hybrid?

39
00:03:54,125 --> 00:04:01,147
Um, does it are you, uh, are you able to meet him on in person?

40
00:04:02,427 --> 00:04:03,287
Does it work for you?

41
00:04:04,148 --> 00:04:05,328
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

42
00:04:05,348 --> 00:04:10,589
Yeah, we can probably do it.

43
00:04:10,729 --> 00:04:15,831
Yeah, for which one?

44
00:04:16,091 --> 00:04:17,351
Both of them are for November.

45
00:04:19,107 --> 00:04:28,693
Um, well, we had talked last time about alternating between, uh, uh, just zoom and hybrid.

46
00:04:28,733 --> 00:04:32,416
So maybe hybrid for November and then just zoom for December.

47
00:04:33,576 --> 00:04:34,077
That's fine.

48
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,322
Oh, I see Samia is joining.

49
00:04:48,715 --> 00:04:52,717
Hi, how are you?

50
00:04:52,737 --> 00:04:52,777
Hi.

51
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:04,162
We were just getting started with some of the administrative parts of it.

52
00:05:04,182 --> 00:05:16,187
We were just talking about the next meetings, November 18th as a hybrid meeting and November 16th as just a Zoom only meeting.

53
00:05:16,347 --> 00:05:17,208
Does that work for you?

54
00:05:18,935 --> 00:05:28,459
Good.

55
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:33,881
We now have a quorum so we could review the minutes from the September meeting.

56
00:05:34,301 --> 00:05:37,563
If you've had time to look at it, I know I sent it to you pretty late.

57
00:05:38,643 --> 00:05:39,744
No, it was great.

58
00:05:50,247 --> 00:05:52,770
Lizette have you had a chance to look at the minutes.

59
00:05:57,754 --> 00:06:00,337
Unfortunately, I haven't, but I'm reading them.

60
00:06:00,377 --> 00:06:02,819
I'm going to try to take a look.

61
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:21,095
We could also just put it off until the next meeting if that's difficult to do right now in the short notice.

62
00:06:24,697 --> 00:06:25,778
No, I think we can do it.

63
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:26,199
Brenda.

64
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:33,684
I mean, it's I just like that as well.

65
00:06:35,966 --> 00:06:37,447
I, like, read, like, half of it right now.

66
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,823
I think it would be good either way to talk about the events.

67
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:52,404
The upcoming events.

68
00:06:53,445 --> 00:06:56,928
Oh, yeah, that's that's the next thing on the on the agenda.

69
00:06:57,228 --> 00:06:57,428
Yep.

70
00:07:02,012 --> 00:07:04,535
Did anybody have any edits to the minutes.

71
00:07:41,358 --> 00:07:44,099
Is that are you just finishing reading through them right now?

72
00:07:44,679 --> 00:07:44,979
Yeah.

73
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:48,940
Okay, but we can start.

74
00:07:54,361 --> 00:07:56,841
Motion to start the meeting guys.

75
00:07:59,242 --> 00:08:03,763
Oh, yeah, yeah, we don't need a motion to start the meeting with the meeting.

76
00:08:03,803 --> 00:08:04,503
1st motion minutes.

77
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:04,803
Yes.

78
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:05,203
Motion.

79
00:08:05,323 --> 00:08:06,163
So, for the minutes guys.

80
00:08:11,595 --> 00:08:15,637
I mean, so far, everything looks good, so I'll just say hi.

81
00:08:18,159 --> 00:08:18,479
Hi.

82
00:08:25,423 --> 00:08:29,785
Okay, meeting and that's an eye from you, is that yes.

83
00:08:31,406 --> 00:08:35,268
Okay, the minutes from September meeting are approved.

84
00:08:39,247 --> 00:08:42,988
That's great, so we can get that online for people to be able to see.

85
00:08:53,572 --> 00:08:57,693
So, next up on the agenda, we have the Medford connects events.

86
00:09:03,355 --> 00:09:03,635
Yes.

87
00:09:07,722 --> 00:09:17,267
So the next, I think the next one we have is the, I just saw it.

88
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:19,088
It was the winter preparedness.

89
00:09:20,049 --> 00:09:22,470
Yeah, I think it's the only one that we are having right now.

90
00:09:24,251 --> 00:09:24,871
November.

91
00:09:25,692 --> 00:09:32,596
And we mentioned about it last week, you know, last meeting that it was going to be at the library, but we changed to the chamber.

92
00:09:32,616 --> 00:09:34,477
Oh, okay.

93
00:09:37,894 --> 00:09:39,795
It's actually really good because it's more space.

94
00:09:40,695 --> 00:09:41,936
Last year it was like crowded.

95
00:09:43,617 --> 00:09:47,218
It's also hard to book things at the library.

96
00:09:47,238 --> 00:09:47,519
Yeah.

97
00:09:47,619 --> 00:09:48,339
Very busy.

98
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:59,744
Yeah, so we are not sure because, you know, election and everything, you know, they have been using the rooms a lot lately, so we didn't think about it until someone mentioned it.

99
00:09:59,804 --> 00:10:00,184
Okay.

100
00:10:00,204 --> 00:10:03,946
Yeah, so it's going to be November 14, 6 to 8.

101
00:10:06,379 --> 00:10:07,539
Oh, 6 to 8, OK.

102
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:08,480
I had it as 6.30.

103
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:09,680
Good to know.

104
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,802
Yeah, that was the library time because they had an event before.

105
00:10:14,682 --> 00:10:15,162
Gotcha.

106
00:10:16,062 --> 00:10:19,444
And Samia, had you sent me the flyer already?

107
00:10:19,684 --> 00:10:21,144
I apologize if you didn't.

108
00:10:21,684 --> 00:10:26,886
Yeah, I shared the Canva with you in case we make any changes.

109
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:32,588
But I can send you the thing again over here just to fly along.

110
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:39,402
Okay, I can look through my email for that too.

111
00:10:44,486 --> 00:10:51,192
Sharp Bell, you were reaching out to ABCD about that, is that all set?

112
00:10:52,253 --> 00:11:01,520
Yes, so first I reached out to Andrea Mendoza, and I guess she spoke with one of her employees that

113
00:11:02,867 --> 00:11:05,649
They're in charge of the outreach in the Medford area.

114
00:11:06,109 --> 00:11:07,250
Her name was Roxanne.

115
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:08,431
I don't know if you know her.

116
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:19,299
But yeah, it seems like Roxanne will be showing up to the winter preparedness event.

117
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:26,404
So thank you again for helping and connecting me with this.

118
00:11:27,624 --> 00:11:28,305
I appreciate it.

119
00:11:28,797 --> 00:11:35,961
ABCD does such great work across all kinds of different topics.

120
00:11:36,961 --> 00:11:38,122
Yeah, they were very nice people.

121
00:11:41,652 --> 00:11:44,394
from just like talking with them on the email.

122
00:11:44,434 --> 00:11:47,717
So, but I'm sure they're very nice people in person too.

123
00:11:48,557 --> 00:12:00,806
And I think it's very important that we get some folks down to kind of explain the fuel assistance programs, because it's so helpful, especially, you know, for the upcoming winter.

124
00:12:00,826 --> 00:12:05,470
Oh, one thing.

125
00:12:07,147 --> 00:12:11,128
I'll jot it down for the city updates later.

126
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:24,291
But I have an update about ABCD, too, that I'll share.

127
00:12:24,311 --> 00:12:31,053
And I'll be there with the Electrify Medford dollhouse and all of that.

128
00:12:33,104 --> 00:12:40,010
We mentioned last time something about the knitting connection, having hats and scarves available for people.

129
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:58,164
Alicia told me that she is working with your mom, Charbel, to get those from the knitting connection building.

130
00:12:58,985 --> 00:13:00,326
That's amazing.

131
00:13:00,366 --> 00:13:01,287
That would be good.

132
00:13:02,415 --> 00:13:11,278
And Catherine, I guess we're having a lot of success with the overall clothing drive because the boxes keep filling up.

133
00:13:11,358 --> 00:13:12,398
Right, Samia?

134
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:17,519
Yes, I'm tired of going over there every week and picking them up.

135
00:13:17,659 --> 00:13:19,300
I think twice they were full.

136
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:22,161
So she had to go back and forth.

137
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:25,542
So yeah, hopefully this will be very successful.

138
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:31,709
Yeah, so and Alicia did reach out.

139
00:13:32,571 --> 00:13:34,878
Katherine shared the email today with me.

140
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:40,252
So she just wanna have an idea how many people are expecting.

141
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:44,053
So she will help us with the donations.

142
00:13:44,373 --> 00:13:45,214
So that's good.

143
00:13:45,854 --> 00:13:49,596
Oh, Samia, are you the one who's organizing this or is it?

144
00:13:50,836 --> 00:13:52,057
Well, it's our office.

145
00:13:52,437 --> 00:13:53,197
Okay, okay.

146
00:13:53,217 --> 00:13:53,437
Yeah.

147
00:13:53,857 --> 00:13:57,299
I'm just wondering if Alicia might've mixed up the person that she'd been speaking with.

148
00:13:57,319 --> 00:13:58,099
Yeah, no, no, no.

149
00:13:58,119 --> 00:14:02,161
She reached out to Catherine and then Catherine just shared the information, yeah.

150
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:09,189
Great.

151
00:14:10,029 --> 00:14:19,375
And then Alicia had also mentioned that the Medford Family Network also gets hats and scarves and things like that from the Knitting Connection.

152
00:14:19,555 --> 00:14:22,476
Is that something that you guys are coordinating too?

153
00:14:23,137 --> 00:14:31,001
Yeah, so I spoke to Mary Cassidy about it, and then depends on what she's going to have, you know, she's probably going to bring it with her.

154
00:14:33,743 --> 00:14:38,286
She wasn't sure yet what she had available and what she would be able to bring.

155
00:14:38,827 --> 00:14:41,849
And they have all the other events they are participating to.

156
00:14:42,049 --> 00:14:46,252
So I assume they kind of take everywhere they go, you know, whatever they can.

157
00:14:47,093 --> 00:14:47,593
So we see.

158
00:14:47,733 --> 00:14:52,356
So that's why we want to make sure that we had at least some from other sources, you know.

159
00:14:52,436 --> 00:14:53,517
Yeah.

160
00:14:55,475 --> 00:15:03,917
And I know that some other partners that are coming to tabling, they are also bringing some stuff to donate.

161
00:15:04,757 --> 00:15:11,318
So I just hope, you know, our residents take advantage of that and they show up.

162
00:15:11,378 --> 00:15:20,040
And, you know, we really got very nice stuff, you know, like great quality coats and stuff.

163
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,000
So, yeah.

164
00:15:21,513 --> 00:15:21,913
That's great.

165
00:15:22,153 --> 00:15:31,098
When you're saying other partners are bringing things to donate, is that mostly coats and hats and scarves?

166
00:15:31,558 --> 00:15:33,459
Yeah, those warm pads.

167
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:40,583
They kind of ask what things that will be interesting for people, and we gave some suggestions like that.

168
00:15:40,883 --> 00:15:41,384
Gloves.

169
00:15:43,867 --> 00:15:54,962
Last year we had the warm blankets and pads, so if anybody would be able to bring some, if everybody brings a little bit, everybody can take some home.

170
00:15:58,824 --> 00:15:59,324
That's great.

171
00:15:59,805 --> 00:16:15,117
I remember when I was at National Grid, there was a company that made wool blankets that was looking to donate blankets to folks through the income eligible programs that Mass Save has.

172
00:16:15,618 --> 00:16:21,082
I wonder if that's something that might be useful too.

173
00:16:21,102 --> 00:16:21,863
That would be.

174
00:16:25,168 --> 00:16:31,073
Yeah, I'll see if I can remember what the name of the company was, and I can try to reach out to them.

175
00:16:33,054 --> 00:16:33,395
Oh, great.

176
00:16:33,415 --> 00:16:34,716
Then we're going to take a look, too.

177
00:16:35,136 --> 00:16:41,841
It's funny that we're talking about the winter preparedness event, and today was such a beautiful day.

178
00:16:42,662 --> 00:16:44,704
And we're only a few weeks out.

179
00:16:44,784 --> 00:16:45,044
It's scary.

180
00:16:52,427 --> 00:16:54,349
Yeah, it was cold last week though.

181
00:16:54,429 --> 00:16:56,510
I turned on my heating system for the first time.

182
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:58,632
Yeah, me too.

183
00:16:58,712 --> 00:17:06,737
But it's scary that, you know, warm today.

184
00:17:06,858 --> 00:17:11,581
I'm always the Debbie Downer who's like, oh, it's unseasonably warm.

185
00:17:11,621 --> 00:17:13,002
Welcome to climate change.

186
00:17:13,222 --> 00:17:17,225
That's what I was going to say too, but I've been holding my tongue.

187
00:17:18,006 --> 00:17:20,487
Because a lot of people don't believe that.

188
00:17:21,805 --> 00:17:27,106
That's what I was like, that's what I was kind of getting to, you know?

189
00:17:27,667 --> 00:17:28,227
Yeah.

190
00:17:29,347 --> 00:17:33,468
Yeah.

191
00:17:34,248 --> 00:17:37,089
Oh, Trey is saying that's why his Wi-Fi is so bad.

192
00:17:37,129 --> 00:17:39,230
He's trying to be outside on such a nice day.

193
00:17:47,142 --> 00:17:49,944
Samia, I want to clarify something.

194
00:17:49,964 --> 00:17:55,368
The Medford Family Network is bringing donated materials to the event?

195
00:17:55,388 --> 00:17:56,969
They're not sure.

196
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:58,450
Okay, they're not sure.

197
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:01,353
Yeah, they're not sure.

198
00:18:01,893 --> 00:18:08,138
I spoke to Mary Cass very briefly, but I called them and I spoke to somebody else over there and that's what they said.

199
00:18:08,478 --> 00:18:13,922
Depends what they have available that day because they need to provide for the families that come to the center,

200
00:18:14,943 --> 00:18:19,655
or whatever events they go, if they see an opportunity for them to give it away, they're gonna do it.

201
00:18:19,876 --> 00:18:21,801
And if they have anything, they will bring it.

202
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:25,604
That makes sense, okay.

203
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:36,347
I was just trying to figure out if you were both asking for things from the Knitting Connection for the same event that happened at the festival this weekend.

204
00:18:37,047 --> 00:18:45,149
We got a last minute frantic thing of like, oh no, the tables that we requested aren't available because some other event is using them that day.

205
00:18:45,669 --> 00:18:51,550
And then after like half an hour of phone calls, we realized no, it was two people requesting tables for the same event.

206
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:54,271
Oh, okay.

207
00:18:55,691 --> 00:19:00,354
You know, my understanding is that they already got some donation, you know.

208
00:19:01,274 --> 00:19:01,734
So, let's see.

209
00:19:02,135 --> 00:19:02,715
That's great.

210
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:14,221
And whatever we have left, you know, it's always going to go to, you know, the partners that are interested to bring it to their places to donate to their, you know, the people that are using their service too, so.

211
00:19:16,402 --> 00:19:16,843
That's good.

212
00:19:16,883 --> 00:19:19,044
So, the stuff is still going to be used regardless?

213
00:19:19,444 --> 00:19:19,684
Yeah.

214
00:19:20,485 --> 00:19:21,005
That's our problem.

215
00:19:25,093 --> 00:19:28,495
Anything else for the winter preparedness event?

216
00:19:28,515 --> 00:19:31,236
I don't think so.

217
00:19:34,538 --> 00:19:37,420
Any other events that are coming up in the next month or so?

218
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:41,742
It says Pumpkin Smash, Brenda, November 2nd.

219
00:19:42,562 --> 00:19:45,544
Are you guys going to be at the Pumpkin Smash?

220
00:19:45,824 --> 00:19:48,045
I'm going to be there for Electrify Medford.

221
00:19:49,686 --> 00:19:54,469
Someone was reaching out to find out more information about it because we never did that before.

222
00:19:58,055 --> 00:20:02,196
So, okay, so I can jump to the updates on city actions if there aren't any other.

223
00:20:02,216 --> 00:20:07,318
Yeah, events to talk about then because yeah, the 1st thing I was going to talk about there was the events.

224
00:20:07,578 --> 00:20:12,100
Um, yeah, the pumpkin smash November 2nd at the West Medford community center.

225
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:21,163
1030 to 1, and we're going to and it's basically for people to compost their jack lanterns.

226
00:20:22,064 --> 00:20:23,426
Instead of throwing them out.

227
00:20:24,006 --> 00:20:33,716
But the way that they're getting, they're drawing people in to do that is by having a pumpkin smash where they basically like take the pumpkins up really high and drop them on the ground to smash them.

228
00:20:33,836 --> 00:20:34,437
So it's fun.

229
00:20:34,857 --> 00:20:40,043
Well, my mom, my mom cooks, you know, pumpkins and makes pumpkin pudding.

230
00:20:40,103 --> 00:20:42,405
So interesting.

231
00:20:45,557 --> 00:20:48,218
Never had a pumpkin pudding before.

232
00:20:48,238 --> 00:20:50,479
Are you kidding me, Sami?

233
00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:51,439
It's so good.

234
00:20:51,779 --> 00:20:53,000
I love pumpkin pudding.

235
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,641
Especially my grandma's recipe.

236
00:20:55,961 --> 00:20:56,441
Forget it.

237
00:20:57,061 --> 00:20:58,282
I love pumpkin pies.

238
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:01,803
No, but it's way better.

239
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:07,546
Like it has like a different taste when it's like from a can versus like the actual real like pumpkin.

240
00:21:10,327 --> 00:21:12,147
If I make some guys, I'll bring you some.

241
00:21:12,728 --> 00:21:13,328
That's awesome.

242
00:21:14,198 --> 00:21:15,419
That would be lovely.

243
00:21:15,439 --> 00:21:18,141
Hey, our next meeting is hybrid, so.

244
00:21:19,342 --> 00:21:25,588
Yeah, I should have my mom be like, pumpkin time.

245
00:21:26,028 --> 00:21:35,136
So yeah, so I don't know if they usually have a lot of tables there, but they invited Electrify Medford to have a table.

246
00:21:35,216 --> 00:21:39,039
So I can, if you want to also have a table there, we could

247
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:45,108
what we could talk to them about getting another table set up there, or you could share our table.

248
00:21:45,728 --> 00:21:46,649
I think that'd be good.

249
00:21:47,589 --> 00:21:48,110
That'd be fun.

250
00:21:51,191 --> 00:21:53,692
Okay, so I'll reach out to them about that.

251
00:21:53,712 --> 00:21:54,893
Thanks, Brenda.

252
00:21:57,054 --> 00:21:59,575
So it's mothers out front who's putting that on.

253
00:22:06,179 --> 00:22:06,859
Let's see.

254
00:22:06,879 --> 00:22:08,420
Oh, here's Natasha.

255
00:22:10,594 --> 00:22:11,154
Finally.

256
00:22:19,598 --> 00:22:20,438
Natasha.

257
00:22:29,041 --> 00:22:39,506
So then after that, and after the winter preparedness event, the next thing that Electrify Medford is going to be at is the winter extravaganza on December 4th.

258
00:22:41,158 --> 00:22:43,320
Are the Medford Connects folks going to be there too?

259
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:47,704
No, we are following your list, you know.

260
00:22:47,724 --> 00:22:48,525
Oh, okay.

261
00:22:48,885 --> 00:22:52,429
Because there are a lot of events that you never even heard about it.

262
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:55,071
Do you know anything about that?

263
00:22:55,471 --> 00:22:56,112
What is that about?

264
00:22:56,452 --> 00:22:57,894
Yeah, I tabled at it last year.

265
00:22:57,934 --> 00:23:00,096
So this is at City Hall from 430 to 630 on December 4th.

266
00:23:03,763 --> 00:23:06,025
So they have lots of outdoor tables.

267
00:23:06,085 --> 00:23:08,726
It's almost like the farmer's market except not food.

268
00:23:08,766 --> 00:23:15,389
It's like a lot of arts and crafts vendors, that sort of thing.

269
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:20,552
They do have food available, like hot cider and things like that.

270
00:23:22,913 --> 00:23:28,216
So they have the outdoor tabling and then indoors they do a tree raffle.

271
00:23:30,382 --> 00:23:37,786
where people will donate Christmas trees decorated with whatever they want to put on them.

272
00:23:38,707 --> 00:23:43,169
And then people will raffle, and then they raffle off the Christmas trees.

273
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:46,431
That's awesome.

274
00:23:46,631 --> 00:23:49,093
And so they usually have different themes.

275
00:23:49,173 --> 00:23:52,114
So one might be like, I don't know, all dolls or something.

276
00:23:52,154 --> 00:23:53,855
And it's just decorated with dolls.

277
00:23:54,176 --> 00:23:57,858
Or when the library did one that was just books, small,

278
00:24:00,842 --> 00:24:03,223
like board books all over it, things like that.

279
00:24:03,323 --> 00:24:04,923
I went to the one last year.

280
00:24:05,043 --> 00:24:05,724
I was mad.

281
00:24:05,764 --> 00:24:10,025
I was like, man, I wanted to win one of those trophies.

282
00:24:10,265 --> 00:24:10,685
I know.

283
00:24:10,765 --> 00:24:11,845
I didn't get any of them.

284
00:24:11,865 --> 00:24:13,026
I didn't get any.

285
00:24:13,446 --> 00:24:14,186
That's crazy.

286
00:24:16,047 --> 00:24:17,027
We should do that event.

287
00:24:18,352 --> 00:24:19,272
That'd be so much fun.

288
00:24:19,752 --> 00:24:20,993
Yeah, sounds fun.

289
00:24:21,553 --> 00:24:23,393
They also do a gingerbread house.

290
00:24:23,493 --> 00:24:26,114
I don't know if it's a contest or just a display thing.

291
00:24:28,814 --> 00:24:33,435
So they just have them up for display during the extravaganza.

292
00:24:33,815 --> 00:24:41,597
And then they do events with kids there, like the Medford Family Network will be there doing some sort of craft activity with kids.

293
00:24:43,558 --> 00:24:50,540
Do they tell you like how to sign up for if you want to like participate in like the tree or like the gingerbread or stuff like that, Brenda?

294
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:51,720
Yes.

295
00:24:51,820 --> 00:25:00,662
So Lisa Coliani in the mayor's office is the one organizing the the tabling and the gingerbread house part of it.

296
00:25:00,742 --> 00:25:03,723
And then there's a different organization that's doing the tree raffle.

297
00:25:05,123 --> 00:25:07,964
But I have their contact information because I'm going to.

298
00:25:08,264 --> 00:25:12,305
So Electrify Medford is going to be tabling and I'm going to put together a

299
00:25:13,485 --> 00:25:15,246
energy efficient gingerbread house.

300
00:25:15,266 --> 00:25:18,348
That sounds so cute.

301
00:25:18,488 --> 00:25:25,472
I'm planning to donate an electrified Medford Christmas tree.

302
00:25:26,953 --> 00:25:30,235
Will an EV be part of it?

303
00:25:31,636 --> 00:25:33,397
An EV car?

304
00:25:33,417 --> 00:25:35,118
That would be amazing.

305
00:25:35,498 --> 00:25:38,680
Just one of the things hanging from the tree is a set of keys.

306
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:48,551
Yeah, so I can send you the information for that.

307
00:25:48,571 --> 00:25:50,713
Awesome.

308
00:25:51,313 --> 00:25:53,875
I'm just saying that we can put it on social media.

309
00:25:56,276 --> 00:25:58,217
Maybe Charmel can dress as a snowman.

310
00:25:58,237 --> 00:26:02,620
Yeah.

311
00:26:04,882 --> 00:26:05,862
That would be amazing.

312
00:26:06,442 --> 00:26:07,243
That would be cute.

313
00:26:08,184 --> 00:26:10,865
I'm going to be freezing in that suit.

314
00:26:14,165 --> 00:26:14,845
What are you talking about?

315
00:26:14,865 --> 00:26:18,066
It's so big and puffy, it could have lots of insulation in there.

316
00:26:20,226 --> 00:26:23,807
That's what happens when you're the only man in a team.

317
00:26:24,747 --> 00:26:25,387
Exactly.

318
00:26:30,888 --> 00:26:34,909
Those are the only other events that I'm planning to be at.

319
00:26:35,289 --> 00:26:38,809
There are other events coming up that I'm not participating in.

320
00:26:38,829 --> 00:26:41,730
There's a business trick-or-treating thing on October 25th.

321
00:26:43,377 --> 00:26:52,205
in Medford Square where a lot of the businesses will just have candy and kids will go around trick-or-treating through them.

322
00:26:53,026 --> 00:26:54,728
Doesn't that include Salem Street as well?

323
00:26:56,729 --> 00:26:57,390
Probably.

324
00:26:57,410 --> 00:26:58,311
Okay.

325
00:26:58,371 --> 00:27:00,733
Because I do that every year with Gabriel.

326
00:27:01,414 --> 00:27:01,914
Oh, nice.

327
00:27:02,415 --> 00:27:02,615
Yeah.

328
00:27:04,658 --> 00:27:05,498
That would be fun.

329
00:27:07,019 --> 00:27:12,482
And then there's a Halloween Fest and pumpkin float at Wright Pond on October 26.

330
00:27:13,262 --> 00:27:15,844
But that doesn't sound like a great tabling opportunity.

331
00:27:15,864 --> 00:27:18,885
I mean, it takes place at night, so it's dark.

332
00:27:19,425 --> 00:27:22,867
And I don't think that there are usually tables around there.

333
00:27:22,967 --> 00:27:26,449
So it didn't seem like a good use of my time.

334
00:27:28,906 --> 00:27:33,570
Oh, Trey was asking if there's a URL with all of these events listed.

335
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:35,171
There's an events calendar.

336
00:27:35,191 --> 00:27:38,654
Let me pull it up here.

337
00:27:38,674 --> 00:27:50,043
And it's not, let's see, here we go.

338
00:27:53,129 --> 00:28:03,335
Always good to go check in on that, although sometimes things can pop up there with a week notice or less before the actual event happens.

339
00:28:03,375 --> 00:28:05,636
Sometimes it can be tough to follow them.

340
00:28:05,656 --> 00:28:12,841
The city's social media, they always share the flyers with more information about those events.

341
00:28:13,261 --> 00:28:14,762
It's good to check that out too.

342
00:28:16,663 --> 00:28:17,283
That's true.

343
00:28:17,423 --> 00:28:21,466
There's a newsletter that the city has that people can sign up for to get.

344
00:28:23,223 --> 00:28:24,604
all of this information.

345
00:28:24,624 --> 00:28:28,806
Let me pull it up here.

346
00:28:41,272 --> 00:28:44,094
So the second link is to sign up for the city's newsletter.

347
00:28:55,823 --> 00:28:58,805
So those are the only other events that I had.

348
00:29:00,606 --> 00:29:07,752
I wanted to take a minute to just say that the bilingual storytime event was really fun.

349
00:29:07,772 --> 00:29:15,458
I don't know how often those happen, but that was great and I would love to be at more of them.

350
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:17,360
No, I had a blast.

351
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:23,785
Honestly, like that was just for like the Hispanic Heritage Month, but I feel like we should be doing like

352
00:29:24,642 --> 00:29:30,463
more events like that with like the kids and like, you know, you and Medford Family Network.

353
00:29:33,644 --> 00:29:34,684
Yeah, definitely.

354
00:29:35,744 --> 00:29:37,525
Especially because it's open to the public.

355
00:29:37,685 --> 00:29:47,727
You know, I went to the Miss Attack on Thursday because they had their book fair, you know, every school have those book fair where they sell the books.

356
00:29:48,505 --> 00:29:55,478
And they decided to have a few classrooms with story time for the kids with different languages, you know, different books.

357
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,343
And I thought that was very cool, you know.

358
00:30:00,228 --> 00:30:02,789
Yeah, maybe you can do something like that at the libraries too.

359
00:30:03,049 --> 00:30:04,510
No, only this one.

360
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:09,553
This one was like extra because like, I don't know if you remember.

361
00:30:09,573 --> 00:30:19,558
I don't know if you were there for the chamber one, but like Esther Gomez is a part of like her, her programs like Spanish fun program.

362
00:30:20,298 --> 00:30:23,119
And she does like a lot of like activities with kids.

363
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:26,821
And one of the activities that we had that day was a

364
00:30:28,442 --> 00:30:39,148
immersive storytelling, so she had her props and everything, and she would speak in Spanish, the other one would speak in English and would say the same story.

365
00:30:40,068 --> 00:30:44,831
And then it was just very interactive, so the kids were engaged.

366
00:30:45,711 --> 00:30:50,433
100%.

367
00:30:45,731 --> 00:30:50,433
There was not a kid that was distracted, that was crying, bored.

368
00:30:50,973 --> 00:30:56,915
It was 100% laughing, dancing, listening, paying attention.

369
00:30:56,955 --> 00:31:00,456
This is the first time I've ever seen a group of kids who didn't.

370
00:31:02,457 --> 00:31:05,378
Is there a lady that was teaching us to dance?

371
00:31:06,463 --> 00:31:17,766
Yeah, the Esther, Esther Gomez, she does a bunch of stuff, like her program, to be honest, I feel like I'm gonna use her for like every event if possible, because that she was really amazing.

372
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:22,868
The first one, obviously, with like the salsa at the chambers was really, really fun.

373
00:31:24,588 --> 00:31:30,090
And then especially the, you know, the kids like storytelling, it was, it was awesome.

374
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:30,810
I really liked her.

375
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:39,812
And it was done slowly enough and with gestures and things like that.

376
00:31:39,832 --> 00:31:46,615
Even without the English translation, I understood about half of it with my terrible, terrible Spanish.

377
00:31:46,935 --> 00:31:48,135
Wow, Brenda.

378
00:31:48,455 --> 00:31:49,015
No.

379
00:31:49,676 --> 00:31:52,977
So I was like, OK, this is the level of my Spanish.

380
00:31:53,057 --> 00:31:55,538
It's like half of a three-year-old's level.

381
00:31:58,032 --> 00:31:58,913
No, it's good.

382
00:31:58,993 --> 00:32:07,677
You know, to be honest, it makes you feel more comfortable, like hearing it, you know, and like being able to like also hear in English and it's not hard.

383
00:32:07,697 --> 00:32:11,559
It can be like your lessons, Brenda, for learning Spanish.

384
00:32:16,806 --> 00:32:21,169
Oh, and then the Harvest Your Energy Festival this past Saturday was, was great.

385
00:32:21,209 --> 00:32:28,955
There were, I think there were more people there than last year, although it's a little hard to tell because the playground is different, has a different configuration now.

386
00:32:30,176 --> 00:32:39,323
Um, so, uh, but a lot of people came just intending to play at the playground and then they were like, oh, wait, there's a festival.

387
00:32:41,825 --> 00:32:43,426
Um, but we had an EV showcase.

388
00:32:43,806 --> 00:32:46,308
I think we had eight electric vehicles there.

389
00:32:47,447 --> 00:32:58,315
And we actually ran the, um, the stoves that deep cuts had to, to heat up their sandwiches off of the electric vehicles, which was fun.

390
00:32:58,796 --> 00:32:59,796
Yeah.

391
00:33:00,357 --> 00:33:06,121
Cause we didn't want to have a noisy, like gross generator there since the EVs were going to be there anyway.

392
00:33:06,141 --> 00:33:08,663
Yeah.

393
00:33:12,332 --> 00:33:19,754
The wind turbine tours were not as popular as they were in the past, just because the festival has moved slightly away from that.

394
00:33:20,414 --> 00:33:29,677
And so we were walking people over to it, but it's not the same as when people are just walking by and just stop and talk to you about it.

395
00:33:32,835 --> 00:33:39,398
But the carnival games that we had for Electrify Medford were very, very popular again.

396
00:33:40,358 --> 00:33:46,921
So it does cost us money to rent them, but I think it's worth it for big events like that.

397
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:55,444
I love the beanbag one, even though Junior keep winning.

398
00:33:55,764 --> 00:34:01,367
But I was thinking we should have little prizes that we give to kids who actually win.

399
00:34:01,407 --> 00:34:01,767
Yeah.

400
00:34:07,622 --> 00:34:11,785
At this point, Brenda, I feel like we should invest in buying those.

401
00:34:16,067 --> 00:34:21,430
Part of it is what would it cost to to hire them to, you know, to make more of those for us.

402
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:23,392
And then the other part is where would we store it?

403
00:34:23,472 --> 00:34:30,476
Because right now we have a hard time even storing the signs that we use at the festival in our office.

404
00:34:33,246 --> 00:34:44,091
Trust me, I feel you on that, my car is full of stuff and I don't know where we're gonna put it.

405
00:34:45,391 --> 00:34:47,752
So I think that's it for events.

406
00:34:48,632 --> 00:34:56,956
For Electrify Medford updates in general, we have 86 residents who've signed up now so far, and 25 of those have been coached.

407
00:35:00,134 --> 00:35:03,436
either by me or by some of the volunteer coaches.

408
00:35:05,777 --> 00:35:21,266
We've contacted almost all of the people who've signed up now, but there's, you know, people get busy and we're not getting a huge percentage of people who are responding after they sign up.

409
00:35:21,406 --> 00:35:29,631
So we'll keep, you know, we'll keep going back to them after, you know, a month or so and see if it's a better time for them.

410
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:35,582
Right now we have nine coaches who are really active with the program.

411
00:35:36,903 --> 00:35:42,926
Some of the coaches that we trained already have either dropped out because they're too busy.

412
00:35:44,286 --> 00:35:48,869
Some of them haven't been able to be very active yet, but still want to be involved.

413
00:35:48,889 --> 00:35:50,409
So we're still keeping them on the list.

414
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:53,531
So we have nine now that are really active with it.

415
00:35:55,952 --> 00:35:56,773
We had,

416
00:35:58,153 --> 00:36:10,988
A couple people from larger condo buildings ask about installing solar because they've been turned down by contractors that they've talked to, just because it's a more complicated situation.

417
00:36:13,466 --> 00:36:24,392
So I spoke to the contractor that Medford used for Solarize Medford back in 2013, and another local one too, actually, at the festival this weekend.

418
00:36:25,833 --> 00:36:30,076
And both of them said they could do it in some cases, but not all.

419
00:36:30,136 --> 00:36:33,097
So they seemed more open to it than the contractors that the

420
00:36:34,665 --> 00:36:42,486
the residents had spoken to before, but it did sound like they weren't going to be able to do it for every situation.

421
00:36:42,506 --> 00:36:52,948
But we're putting residents in touch with them so that they can see exactly what the situation is on those buildings and see if there's something they can move forward with.

422
00:36:56,069 --> 00:36:59,870
We saw that problem when I worked at National Grid, too.

423
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:22,153
with home performance contractors who would sometimes, they would find out that somebody lived in a condo building, even if it was a smaller condo building, like three units or something, and they would just decide not to serve them because it was more difficult to get the owners of the building to agree to move forward with something.

424
00:37:28,406 --> 00:37:44,730
One other Electrify Medford thing, I'm planning to apply for Mass Save's Community First Partnership, which is where you actually work with the utility to get word out about the program.

425
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:47,491
They give you data about exactly how many

426
00:37:48,651 --> 00:37:59,623
people in your community are doing different things like getting home energy assessments or installing insulation or installing heating systems, and then you agree to goals to increase those.

427
00:38:01,145 --> 00:38:09,574
And so then we, the real reason that I want to do this is so I can get this data from the utility and get updated data as we move along, because otherwise it's

428
00:38:12,047 --> 00:38:17,828
We can get it at a very high aggregate level, but not at the level that we could get it at by working with them.

429
00:38:18,908 --> 00:38:22,809
But they'll also have funding available for us to help with outreach.

430
00:38:23,829 --> 00:38:29,891
And they'll also do outreach for us, like having inserts in utility bills.

431
00:38:30,331 --> 00:38:36,192
So I'm really looking forward to applying to that and including them in the program.

432
00:38:41,991 --> 00:38:44,633
Changing topics a little bit.

433
00:38:46,174 --> 00:38:48,996
The electricity, Medford's electricity aggregation.

434
00:38:49,016 --> 00:38:54,120
We just put out the press release about the renewal for that on Friday.

435
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:56,742
And it's all good news.

436
00:38:57,103 --> 00:39:04,469
The cost went down about one cent per kilowatt hour, and the renewable energy content went up from 5% to 10% additional content.

437
00:39:09,145 --> 00:39:11,346
And that's locked in for the next three years.

438
00:39:11,526 --> 00:39:15,427
It won't go up and down like the regular utility bills will.

439
00:39:16,887 --> 00:39:17,587
That's really good.

440
00:39:21,408 --> 00:39:34,912
And the letter for that will go out to residents who are enrolled in the aggregation already in early November, and then the change will show up on their bills for their December billing cycle.

441
00:39:42,298 --> 00:39:45,860
And yeah, it's great that the costs are going down in general.

442
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:55,285
The cost for the renewable energy content is going down even more than for the standard product that is sort of the default.

443
00:39:56,086 --> 00:40:07,572
Right now, our cost is about, is a little over 18 cents per kilowatt hour for 100% renewable electricity through the program.

444
00:40:09,712 --> 00:40:17,974
And with the new contract, it drops down to 16.6, I think, something like that.

445
00:40:18,514 --> 00:40:26,215
It's actually right now, it's only like six tenths of a cent higher than what National Grid's default rate is.

446
00:40:27,456 --> 00:40:29,276
So that's pretty exciting.

447
00:40:29,316 --> 00:40:33,217
I'm hoping that will make more people choose to opt up to 100% renewables.

448
00:40:41,034 --> 00:40:57,210
Um, there might be some confusion happening around that after the, I don't think most people pay attention to the press release, but once the letter goes out in early November, we might hear from residents who are asking about what this is and why the city is doing it and stuff like that.

449
00:40:57,271 --> 00:41:03,537
So I just want to make sure that you're aware of it and can, can talk with people about it if it comes up.

450
00:41:14,178 --> 00:41:16,062
Let's see the compost program.

451
00:41:18,732 --> 00:41:25,076
We have about 4,600 people signed up for it right now.

452
00:41:25,096 --> 00:41:28,338
I thought it was higher than that, but I got the exact number.

453
00:41:28,378 --> 00:41:29,619
It's 4,608.

454
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:35,042
And it's been stalled right around there for a few months now.

455
00:41:36,983 --> 00:41:42,967
So we planned on 6,000 people participating in the first year.

456
00:41:43,728 --> 00:41:47,490
So if there's anybody that you know that's interested,

457
00:41:48,411 --> 00:41:53,205
and signing up for curbside compost, we still have room in the program.

458
00:41:53,807 --> 00:41:55,592
We're really trying to get the word out about that.

459
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:06,741
Oh, and I had said I wanted to give you an update about ABCD.

460
00:42:07,401 --> 00:42:07,781
Oh, yeah.

461
00:42:08,261 --> 00:42:08,441
Yeah.

462
00:42:08,681 --> 00:42:26,805
So the utility discount rate, which you can sign up for through ABCD, I just saw a news article talking about how moving forward, I don't know starting when exactly, but the utilities have been approved to do this.

463
00:42:28,305 --> 00:42:45,551
they will automatically sign people up for the income eligible discount rate if people are enrolled in a benefits program that confirms their income is at the correct level.

464
00:42:46,051 --> 00:42:47,752
So things like MassHealth and

465
00:42:50,201 --> 00:42:56,047
basically anything that is on the list that National Grid has on their website.

466
00:42:56,107 --> 00:42:57,308
Let me pull this up right now.

467
00:42:57,328 --> 00:43:06,677
Does that include the fuel assistance program, the HEAP, I think it's called?

468
00:43:07,464 --> 00:43:09,125
Yep, yep, exactly.

469
00:43:09,746 --> 00:43:19,735
But now, sort of the first step in getting the fuel assistance program is confirming your income and getting onto the utility discount rate.

470
00:43:19,775 --> 00:43:24,999
So if you're signed up for HEAP through ABCD, they would automatically sign you up for that anyway.

471
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:34,147
But there are these other non-ABCD related programs really that would also

472
00:43:35,543 --> 00:43:37,384
now happen automatically.

473
00:43:37,404 --> 00:43:50,652
And so those are like, you know, food stamps or Head Start or, you know, public housing or WIC, SSI, all of those programs.

474
00:43:51,352 --> 00:44:02,662
So that's going to be amazing, because there are a lot of people out there who are eligible for the discount rate that either don't know or don't want to go through the hassle of signing up for it.

475
00:44:02,762 --> 00:44:05,184
And this way, they just get automatically opted in.

476
00:44:05,204 --> 00:44:09,387
That's amazing.

477
00:44:13,531 --> 00:44:19,176
Well, it kind of makes sense, too, because when do you go to enroll for those discounts, they want to know

478
00:44:19,912 --> 00:44:23,835
what other, you know, help you're getting.

479
00:44:23,895 --> 00:44:31,421
So to confirm, you know, like if you have MassHealth, you need to send your MassHealth letter, you know, acceptance letter and stuff like that.

480
00:44:31,921 --> 00:44:32,101
Yep.

481
00:44:32,782 --> 00:44:35,344
If you all together, it makes sense, you know?

482
00:44:36,264 --> 00:44:36,505
Yeah.

483
00:44:36,985 --> 00:44:40,988
And why would you have to confirm your income more than once, you know?

484
00:44:41,008 --> 00:44:41,228
Yeah.

485
00:44:41,668 --> 00:44:42,349
That's what I'm saying.

486
00:44:42,369 --> 00:44:47,032
Like if the, like MassHealth, if the, you know, government,

487
00:44:48,582 --> 00:44:54,127
already confirming that that's your income that is, you know, why, you know, anyway.

488
00:44:54,888 --> 00:44:55,048
Yep.

489
00:44:55,629 --> 00:44:56,349
Makes more sense.

490
00:44:56,730 --> 00:44:56,910
Yes.

491
00:44:56,950 --> 00:44:58,051
So I was very excited about that.

492
00:44:58,471 --> 00:45:00,613
I don't, I don't know exactly when that's going to start.

493
00:45:00,673 --> 00:45:08,280
So I'm going to continue talking to people about signing up for the discount rate until I'm sure that that's happening automatically.

494
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:10,162
That's great.

495
00:45:16,487 --> 00:45:21,690
I think that's it for my updates on city actions right now.

496
00:45:23,311 --> 00:45:38,599
We can move on to green jobs unless folks have questions about anything that either that we talked about or that they've heard about and want to ask questions on, things that the city's doing.

497
00:45:51,110 --> 00:46:15,188
Okay, so we had talked briefly last time about sort of, I think of it as workforce development, but also like green jobs or sort of connecting people with jobs in the building construction field.

498
00:46:16,967 --> 00:46:20,748
Um, so, and we talked about it a couple of different ways, right?

499
00:46:20,788 --> 00:46:37,351
We had said about city projects and making sure that people are being hired onto city projects and then, um, also like training programs to like get people to the point where they're, um, qualified to be, to be hired for, for these different jobs.

500
00:46:37,771 --> 00:46:42,552
And I know sometimes there's kind of a disparity between the two and you go through a training program and then you're like, okay.

501
00:46:44,179 --> 00:46:51,691
Where are the job opportunities for this now and that's been a lot of frustration around training programs in the past.

502
00:46:52,352 --> 00:46:59,062
So, a lot of the ones that I know about now are really trying to match with employers.

503
00:47:00,145 --> 00:47:12,651
to try to have a sort of a pipeline going from the training program to employers, to different varying levels of success there, but it's what they're sort of trying to do.

504
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:24,276
But so city projects on the one hand, because this came up as part of the Andrews and McGlynn HVAC upgrade project.

505
00:47:25,657 --> 00:47:25,817
And

506
00:47:29,367 --> 00:47:31,448
I want to talk about a couple of things here.

507
00:47:31,528 --> 00:47:40,111
So there's prevailing wage requirements for all city projects, all city construction projects.

508
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:54,755
So it's not saying that someone has to be a part of a union, but it does say that whoever is, you know, whatever contractor we've hired has to be paying their employees the prevailing wage for that trade.

509
00:47:57,922 --> 00:48:09,236
And we get lists from the state that show exactly what the prevailing wage is for different trades when we do those contracts.

510
00:48:10,397 --> 00:48:12,820
And that's written into the contracts and that's required.

511
00:48:15,865 --> 00:48:21,368
There are also DCAM certification requirements for any projects over $150,000.

512
00:48:21,929 --> 00:48:28,213
And DCAM is like the Department of Capital Asset Management.

513
00:48:29,153 --> 00:48:30,014
There's another M there.

514
00:48:30,054 --> 00:48:41,141
I don't remember what it stands for, but it's a state department that certifies that companies meet certain requirements.

515
00:48:42,021 --> 00:48:43,102
And I can share.

516
00:48:45,203 --> 00:48:47,046
I could share my screen here.

517
00:48:55,597 --> 00:48:56,538
Can you see my screen?

518
00:48:56,559 --> 00:49:00,324
Okay, cool.

519
00:49:02,261 --> 00:49:08,583
So this is for contractors that we would be hiring for our construction projects.

520
00:49:09,164 --> 00:49:14,485
If it's over $150,000 project, then the contractor has to be DCAM certified.

521
00:49:18,166 --> 00:49:23,088
And, sorry, trying to pull up.

522
00:49:26,909 --> 00:49:28,390
And it's really more trying to,

523
00:49:30,803 --> 00:49:43,934
identify contractors that are going to be reliable for a city that are not going to go bankrupt or not like brand new and haven't done these sorts of projects before.

524
00:49:43,954 --> 00:49:48,117
And so there's prime certification, they have to have

525
00:49:51,182 --> 00:49:53,883
So this is the primary contractor who's applying.

526
00:49:54,204 --> 00:50:02,408
They could also have subcontractors underneath them, or there could be subcontractors who apply separately from the prime contractor.

527
00:50:04,169 --> 00:50:12,994
But there are these requirements at different levels for the different levels of contractors who might be bidding on these projects.

528
00:50:14,575 --> 00:50:18,037
And so I think this is an interesting thing because I think this,

529
00:50:19,498 --> 00:50:24,640
can be a complication, especially for small businesses, to get city contracts.

530
00:50:26,681 --> 00:50:46,869
We were doing an electrical recircuiting project at the Andrews School as part of a resilience thing, where we were looking to put more things onto the backup generator so that it could be used as a shelter when the power was out.

531
00:50:49,629 --> 00:51:04,000
as one contractor who I would have chosen all else, they would have gotten the bid all else equal, but they were not DCAM certified and it was a project over $150,000.

532
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:07,003
So they were not eligible.

533
00:51:07,423 --> 00:51:11,026
And that happens a lot, especially for, you know,

534
00:51:14,050 --> 00:51:32,098
uh for like minority contractors a lot of times we'll see a lot of smaller businesses that have um that don't have dcam certification and so that's one of the big pushes that i think the state is doing is trying to get more businesses certified here and one of the options is um

535
00:51:34,037 --> 00:51:48,184
Because the requirements are smaller for sub-bidders, one of the options for smaller contractors is going into a project as a sub-bidder underneath a prime contractor.

536
00:51:54,997 --> 00:52:05,986
OK, and then there's just a very strict procurement process required by the state for how we procure different types of vendors for different types of projects and different levels of project costs.

537
00:52:06,786 --> 00:52:13,011
So at a high level, it's generally like under $10,000, you just use sound business practices.

538
00:52:13,932 --> 00:52:17,615
So you're just looking for a good deal for the city.

539
00:52:17,635 --> 00:52:19,776
$10,000 to $50,000, we need to get three quotes.

540
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:52,393
And then over $50,000, we need to do a sealed bid or proposal, like an RFP or an RFQ process, which is, it takes longer, it's more complicated, but the idea is you're doing it that way, so you're not having cronyism and people hiring their family members and stuff like that has happened in the past in lots of cities.

541
00:52:54,284 --> 00:53:07,955
And then there are also state contracts where the state has gone through a procurement process already and qualified some vendors to be used for state projects and for city projects too.

542
00:53:07,975 --> 00:53:16,362
So then you can pull from this list of vendors that are on the state contract.

543
00:53:17,467 --> 00:53:28,492
and you don't have to go necessarily through the RFQ process or RFP process for the same dollar amount.

544
00:53:28,532 --> 00:53:34,635
You would still have to for higher dollar amounts, but instead of 50, you could go up to a higher amount.

545
00:53:38,058 --> 00:53:51,464
Lots of different requirements for lots of different types of projects that we're doing just so that you guys understand how that that that whole procurement process works I don't know how involved you've been in procurement for cities before.

546
00:53:54,758 --> 00:54:02,763
I think that one of the concerns I think will be more like giving the priority for the residents first to have access to those jobs.

547
00:54:03,863 --> 00:54:15,370
And then, you know, it's just like, you know, companies normally like the inside opportunity first, you know, if you know anybody, if anybody's interested in that position, you know, and then they put it to the public.

548
00:54:16,233 --> 00:54:23,374
Maybe it should be like that residence first, and then if anybody show interest, and then put out there.

549
00:54:23,614 --> 00:54:23,914
Yeah.

550
00:54:25,275 --> 00:54:25,935
It's interesting.

551
00:54:25,975 --> 00:54:36,036
So Boston has a requirement that all employees have to be residents of the city, which is maybe going too far in that direction.

552
00:54:36,056 --> 00:54:40,177
It doesn't require that for contractors, though.

553
00:54:40,877 --> 00:54:43,678
It's just for actual city employees.

554
00:54:47,183 --> 00:54:59,212
They do have goals for residents on certain projects, but I think those are actually the hardest goals for them to meet.

555
00:54:59,573 --> 00:55:07,839
Other ways that we can increase participation in projects is having minority and women business enterprise goals.

556
00:55:09,056 --> 00:55:14,057
so that the actual company is owned by a woman or a person of color.

557
00:55:14,077 --> 00:55:17,538
And so we do have goals for that.

558
00:55:17,558 --> 00:55:22,399
There's a state certification, and there are statewide goals for it.

559
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:27,780
And I think I'll drop these in the chat, actually.

560
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:32,142
They're surprisingly small.

561
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:37,723
There you go.

562
00:55:44,005 --> 00:55:49,509
And there's a state certification process to be certified as a MWBE.

563
00:55:53,812 --> 00:55:59,436
And the city of Boston, sorry, I'll go on.

564
00:55:59,716 --> 00:56:03,459
There are also workforce participation goals too.

565
00:56:03,579 --> 00:56:05,900
So what I just dropped in there is for,

566
00:56:08,322 --> 00:56:10,023
who owns the company, basically.

567
00:56:10,723 --> 00:56:19,165
And then this is for numbers I'm just dropping in now are for the actual workforce.

568
00:56:22,085 --> 00:56:23,946
And again, that's a statewide bowl.

569
00:56:25,666 --> 00:56:31,748
So it looks especially small for cities in the greater Boston area.

570
00:56:36,393 --> 00:56:56,828
And then if a city were to have our own set of goals, we first need to do a disparity study where we look at all of the contracts that the city has awarded and look at what the workforce is for what the city is currently doing.

571
00:56:58,075 --> 00:57:01,338
and compare it to the city's actual population.

572
00:57:01,618 --> 00:57:12,388
And if there's a disparity, like a significant difference between those two things, then we could set citywide goals, city-specific goals.

573
00:57:13,790 --> 00:57:25,978
Boston did that, it took them years to do it and cost them a lot of money to do that disparity study in a way that where they wouldn't be sued afterwards for it, yeah.

574
00:57:26,619 --> 00:57:40,008
So I'm not sure that that's something that Medford is, I don't think that's something that Medford is looking into right now, but it's an interesting thing to keep on the burner for maybe for the future and to talk to people about.

575
00:57:41,943 --> 00:57:51,907
And then Boston also has goals for Boston residents as part of these contracts.

576
00:57:53,607 --> 00:58:03,891
And yeah, like I said, of the three types of goals that they include in their contracts, the local residents one is actually the most difficult one for them to reach.

577
00:58:10,057 --> 00:58:32,355
And there, but there are part of how they're working on it is not just setting the goals, but also trying to connect the companies that they're working with, with some of the training programs so that there's like an on-ramp for local residents who start take doing these training programs to get.

578
00:58:32,983 --> 00:58:40,809
into these companies and the companies have an incentive to hire them because they want the contracts with the city, right?

579
00:58:40,929 --> 00:58:45,393
So it's kind of an interesting process there.

580
00:58:45,833 --> 00:58:52,678
And they've set up a lot of their own training programs, but there are lots of other ones that Medford residents could take advantage of too.

581
00:58:53,339 --> 00:58:58,042
So there's the vocational schools and the community colleges that you might think of, right?

582
00:58:58,103 --> 00:59:02,446
Like Bunker Hill or Franklin Cummings or places like that.

583
00:59:05,551 --> 00:59:20,117
And now with the community college tuition thing that the state of Massachusetts is doing, that could actually be free to residents, depending on their income.

584
00:59:22,078 --> 00:59:29,981
And then there are pre-apprenticeship programs, like Youth Build Boston, Building Pathways,

585
00:59:32,060 --> 00:59:51,025
start with someone who has absolutely no experience with the building trades and do some like very initial training to get them on the path to getting an apprenticeship with a union and getting a good union job from that.

586
00:59:51,445 --> 00:59:54,426
So those are really great programs for people to participate in.

587
00:59:54,446 --> 00:59:58,127
A lot of times you'll also be paid while you're doing these trainings.

588
01:00:01,058 --> 01:00:05,382
They're very competitive though, so it can be difficult to actually get into them.

589
01:00:07,444 --> 01:00:10,988
And then there are other training programs that are just separate from the building trades.

590
01:00:11,068 --> 01:00:14,912
So there's like, LISC has a Bridges to Green Jobs program.

591
01:00:14,952 --> 01:00:20,798
Right now it's just specific to Boston and to Lawrence, but they've been talking about expanding that.

592
01:00:20,918 --> 01:00:21,999
And so I would love to

593
01:00:23,183 --> 01:00:26,544
get folks from Medford into that if they expand it.

594
01:00:26,564 --> 01:00:28,645
So I've been talking with them about that.

595
01:00:29,286 --> 01:00:31,526
There's a weatherization training program.

596
01:00:32,027 --> 01:00:35,308
There's a beams is the name of this one.

597
01:00:35,368 --> 01:00:37,809
It's like an energy management program.

598
01:00:39,670 --> 01:00:43,451
So, I mean, these are all great things that people could take advantage of.

599
01:00:43,891 --> 01:00:47,353
And again, a lot of these will pay you as you're doing the training.

600
01:00:49,816 --> 01:01:03,801
And then there are programs for existing workers, like building operator certification, MassSave has programs for contractors, and then there's a MassCEC, Mass Clean Energy Center job board.

601
01:01:04,341 --> 01:01:13,084
So if you already have been trained, you already, you know, have the expertise to do this work, they have this job board to help you find jobs.

602
01:01:17,358 --> 01:01:33,807
And then for business owners, Emerald Cities has a contractor academy with the goal of helping women and minority business owners to expand their businesses and to connect with jobs.

603
01:01:33,827 --> 01:01:40,170
And this is all particular to building construction.

604
01:01:41,950 --> 01:01:44,993
and renovation, energy efficiency, things like that.

605
01:01:45,673 --> 01:02:03,186
And so they, I think, do a really great job of connecting these companies with cities, with the state, with large organizations that are doing projects to get them hired on to do this work.

606
01:02:04,387 --> 01:02:05,948
So they're a really great resource for them.

607
01:02:07,069 --> 01:02:10,231
And then in terms of funding,

608
01:02:11,582 --> 01:02:14,384
There's, I mentioned the tuition-free community college.

609
01:02:15,965 --> 01:02:19,127
And then there's also a Mass Save Workforce Training Grant.

610
01:02:19,528 --> 01:02:36,800
So if someone wants to do a training program that isn't one of these that are paying you as you're doing the process, and it's a program where you actually have to pay for it, you could apply for this Mass Save Workforce Training Grant.

611
01:02:36,820 --> 01:02:37,340
I think it's up to $10,000.

612
01:02:40,277 --> 01:02:42,138
So that could be a really great opportunity.

613
01:02:45,480 --> 01:03:04,252
So I know that was a lot, but were there particular areas that you were interested in diving into more or putting something together to be able to communicate it to residents who might be interested?

614
01:03:11,259 --> 01:03:12,319
Friend, I have a question.

615
01:03:12,419 --> 01:03:26,163
Do you ever have like a night where it can be like for like information and stuff and like have all like you know the resources and everything there?

616
01:03:28,503 --> 01:03:34,385
So you know like people like for example like you know how like now it's all like the voting and stuff?

617
01:03:35,522 --> 01:03:40,165
Like, that would be a good way to have all the info there for people.

618
01:03:40,886 --> 01:03:44,549
So just in case they go by, they see, oh, there's a table there with info.

619
01:03:44,569 --> 01:03:46,270
Let me see what's going on.

620
01:03:46,910 --> 01:03:47,611
You know what I mean?

621
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:51,514
Yeah, definitely.

622
01:03:51,534 --> 01:03:56,698
And I know that I keep referencing Boston, because I was at Boston.

623
01:03:57,158 --> 01:03:59,500
And they had a lot of resources to do this sort of thing.

624
01:04:01,201 --> 01:04:02,062
But they would have.

625
01:04:03,465 --> 01:04:13,334
once or twice a year, they would host a job fair to have people not just from the training programs, but also employers come in to do a job fair.

626
01:04:13,354 --> 01:04:17,617
I think that'd be like so good for us.

627
01:04:24,703 --> 01:04:29,688
Who who does this work in Medford?

628
01:04:33,247 --> 01:04:40,309
I'm not particularly aware of of organizations that are doing sort of like workforce development.

629
01:04:41,389 --> 01:04:46,531
Stuff here, I don't know.

630
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:47,991
I think we'd have to find that out.

631
01:04:49,351 --> 01:04:50,892
Yeah, I'm not aware of that either.

632
01:04:50,912 --> 01:04:56,693
Yeah, because I feel like.

633
01:04:57,854 --> 01:05:00,434
I'm certainly not an expert on this.

634
01:05:00,554 --> 01:05:01,955
I've done I've done some.

635
01:05:03,098 --> 01:05:14,362
work like connecting people to these types of resources in the past, but I'm not aware of sort of the landscape here in Medford for it.

636
01:05:16,783 --> 01:05:19,945
So that might just be the first step is for us to do some research.

637
01:05:33,012 --> 01:05:33,232
Yeah.

638
01:05:46,524 --> 01:05:56,653
Yeah, I mean, we could put together some information about this that we could have available, like even if it's just like a flyer or on our website.

639
01:06:00,032 --> 01:06:08,559
But I think the most useful way for us to get that out there would be to partner with someone who's has some connection like that.

640
01:06:11,522 --> 01:06:16,366
I just think that we should just take advantage that people are going to go vote and do have early voting.

641
01:06:17,093 --> 01:06:30,056
and some go to like, you know, different spots, and you can have like at least like a flyer or something that has like all the like, not all the info, but like, you know, links to where you can get the info and stuff like that.

642
01:06:30,196 --> 01:06:41,778
Just so like, because a lot of people sometimes don't have time to be going on like, you know, they they people see what like, you know, where they go, like they see stuff.

643
01:06:41,818 --> 01:06:41,978
So

644
01:06:44,008 --> 01:06:50,893
I know for a fact that my mom's always like, and my dad, when they go around, they see something they grab and they're asking questions about it.

645
01:06:50,993 --> 01:06:57,819
So I think that'd be a good way to like spread the word out for all these resources.

646
01:07:02,742 --> 01:07:13,691
Yeah, I think I think we talked a lot about, you know, online and, you know, website, social media, but there's still a lot of people that don't have access to that.

647
01:07:14,107 --> 01:07:20,051
You know, so I always like the printing option.

648
01:07:21,832 --> 01:07:27,555
Even if they just take a picture, take with them, you know, like, you know, save some papers too, you know.

649
01:07:27,575 --> 01:07:41,144
We can't print thousands of flyers to be distributed, but I'd be interested to find the right amount of information to put in one flyer too, that it can be, you know, enough.

650
01:07:42,518 --> 01:07:47,281
That's the problem too, is so much that it can fit everything in one little file.

651
01:07:48,181 --> 01:07:49,722
Yeah, and not be overwhelming.

652
01:07:49,742 --> 01:07:50,542
Yeah.

653
01:07:50,842 --> 01:07:51,143
Yeah.

654
01:07:51,503 --> 01:07:54,624
That's true.

655
01:07:54,764 --> 01:07:58,646
Do you guys get questions about this a lot?

656
01:07:58,666 --> 01:08:04,810
Do you have residents talking to you about looking for jobs or?

657
01:08:05,691 --> 01:08:06,931
Things like that.

658
01:08:07,071 --> 01:08:29,136
That's why we have been talking a lot about that, because like, but I think the main thing, you know, like, they don't know the options of even the city jobs, you know, like, it's not everybody who thinks that anybody can apply for a city job, you know, like, and, but it'd be good to have some partnership with the business, the local business to, you know, and

659
01:08:30,413 --> 01:08:35,777
that we can reach out to them, hey, we have these families, you know, in our city that are looking for jobs.

660
01:08:35,797 --> 01:08:38,859
Do you have anything available that can, you know, help us out?

661
01:08:39,679 --> 01:08:46,764
And even training, you know, maybe you're not going to give that person the job, but maybe have, you know,

662
01:08:48,388 --> 01:09:02,091
make a commitment, maybe those first 90 days you're paying that person to work with you, that way the person is also learning something and be ready to find a job and get a little experience to, you know, find a job somewhere else.

663
01:09:03,152 --> 01:09:03,552
I don't know.

664
01:09:03,952 --> 01:09:04,632
Yeah, Brenda.

665
01:09:05,492 --> 01:09:05,852
You do.

666
01:09:06,172 --> 01:09:06,433
Yeah.

667
01:09:07,113 --> 01:09:07,333
Yes.

668
01:09:08,766 --> 01:09:22,125
I get very frustrated in talking with employers about this sort of thing, because you'll hear from them a lot, especially in the construction field, that they have a hard time finding people who are qualified.

669
01:09:23,534 --> 01:09:27,575
And, um, and my first reaction to that is okay.

670
01:09:28,796 --> 01:09:30,216
And hire someone and train them.

671
01:09:30,836 --> 01:09:34,597
And then you'll, they'll be qualified in exactly the way you want them to be.

672
01:09:35,118 --> 01:09:43,320
But nobody wants to take that time and invest in a person because they expect them to then move on really quickly afterwards or something.

673
01:09:43,860 --> 01:09:48,201
When, whereas I think that would just make somebody more loyal to their job.

674
01:09:48,442 --> 01:09:48,882
Right.

675
01:09:49,062 --> 01:09:49,302
Yeah.

676
01:09:52,293 --> 01:09:56,675
Yeah, in all honesty, I know for a fact that we all do.

677
01:09:56,735 --> 01:10:06,260
But I too get like, a lot of people asking me just today, as I was drinking, Marie Cassidy calls me like, I have a Spanish like, lady here.

678
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:10,062
And she doesn't speak any English, but she's trying to get a job and all this stuff.

679
01:10:10,122 --> 01:10:14,304
And I'm like, immediately, I'm just like, target, target hires.

680
01:10:14,924 --> 01:10:18,986
Even if you don't even speak like English, there's people here that speak the language.

681
01:10:19,087 --> 01:10:19,767
So you're good to go.

682
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:43,154
Like, you know, like, I always try to, like, get people at least, you know, whatever, like, job openings that I know about, I'll, like, say, you know, but every single day I always get asked, oh, is, um, are they applying, like, are they, like, you know, wanting people or, oh, do you know about jobs and this, and just random people, too, that come up to me.

683
01:10:43,215 --> 01:10:46,857
So I think that's very important for us in our community.

684
01:10:50,107 --> 01:10:51,068
Yeah, definitely.

685
01:10:51,528 --> 01:10:58,093
And as I'm thinking about this topic, I'm thinking about green building jobs, right?

686
01:10:58,653 --> 01:11:10,141
But I think that you're getting probably reached out to from people who are looking for, not that specific, they're looking for anything.

687
01:11:10,662 --> 01:11:16,406
So this might be a broader effort than just what I was thinking of in terms of green building.

688
01:11:16,846 --> 01:11:17,847
So it might be worth,

689
01:11:19,225 --> 01:11:22,707
Um, can, can one of you guys follow up with Catherine?

690
01:11:23,688 --> 01:11:40,197
Um, just to see if there's a way for that, for your, for that office to, to do something that's maybe broader than what I would be focusing on.

691
01:11:41,658 --> 01:11:46,081
We can all talk about that on Wednesday and our meeting, all of us.

692
01:11:49,197 --> 01:11:49,417
Great.

693
01:11:50,518 --> 01:11:52,080
Yeah, Margaret said mass hire.

694
01:11:52,140 --> 01:11:53,181
We do that a lot too.

695
01:11:54,222 --> 01:11:55,284
We work with mass hire.

696
01:11:55,304 --> 01:12:00,970
Unfortunately, there's a lot of people who want to work just in Medford.

697
01:12:00,990 --> 01:12:02,872
So that's the issue.

698
01:12:05,995 --> 01:12:07,537
Because they don't have transportation?

699
01:12:09,699 --> 01:12:09,900
Yes.

700
01:12:11,985 --> 01:12:13,006
Yes, yes, yes.

701
01:12:13,086 --> 01:12:34,643
I remember, I think that night that we were at the like storytelling thing, Diana, who's like part of like with me, like the YMCA Food Justice Council, her husband just came and like, I don't know if it was from Puerto Rico or something, and he's trying to find a job and, you know, like he doesn't want to go as far because, you know, he just had a

702
01:12:35,524 --> 01:12:44,490
a daughter like a little baby daughter and he has two other kids so he's not trying to like go far for work just in case like they need that like him so it's like

703
01:12:45,741 --> 01:12:54,805
It's hard to get something here specifically unless, like you were saying, people who are qualified.

704
01:12:54,865 --> 01:12:56,585
I think that's the most annoying thing.

705
01:12:57,185 --> 01:12:59,806
They should be able to train someone.

706
01:12:59,887 --> 01:13:02,968
Even, for example, here, the Target in Medford, they train.

707
01:13:03,168 --> 01:13:07,609
Even if you don't have, say you have the minimum experience, they help you and they train you here.

708
01:13:07,690 --> 01:13:12,011
And they understand that everyone has different learning abilities.

709
01:13:14,272 --> 01:13:42,503
obviously language as well so but they're still able to do it you know what i mean so for a good like first job for people especially immigrants too like it's a it's good like i recently helped one of my um uh what's it called um students from the english language classes that we were doing at the library he just got a job here at target and he's algerian he won the lottery to get you know

710
01:13:43,896 --> 01:14:06,055
um to be here like a resident and I helped him get a job and now he's like so happy like you know it makes me happy too to be able to like help anybody you know achieve their goals get a job and and do stuff for them for them and for their family but I think that's like the most important thing for us to help them out.

711
01:14:10,679 --> 01:14:11,660
Oh Brenda you're muted.

712
01:14:15,237 --> 01:14:15,878
Thank you.

713
01:14:17,379 --> 01:14:39,918
I was just thinking about this the other day because one of the Electrify Medford coaches, her son worked in construction in Haiti, but he doesn't have the, well, the certifications or the English skills right now to get the certifications that he would need to do that sort of job here.

714
01:14:41,208 --> 01:14:48,111
Um, and so, yeah, so I was just thinking like, that's, that's kind of a multi-step process in that case, right?

715
01:14:48,371 --> 01:14:55,494
Like you need to, you know, improve your English skills, get your, get the GED.

716
01:14:55,514 --> 01:14:55,594
Yeah.

717
01:14:57,694 --> 01:15:04,437
Then do the training that you would need in order to, um, do the, like the specific skilled work.

718
01:15:06,101 --> 01:15:14,815
Yeah, that's why we're offering the language classes, the language access classes in the library to help, you know,

719
01:15:15,637 --> 01:15:28,787
people who have like the basic or minimal like English proficiency and be able to, you know, at least speak the basics to be able to get a job that way they can learn more as they're working.

720
01:15:28,807 --> 01:15:30,829
Because I know that that's possible.

721
01:15:30,889 --> 01:15:35,232
Like, there's so many, like, we all come from like immigrant families.

722
01:15:37,053 --> 01:15:41,717
Mine in particular, for example, like my dad's brothers were Portuguese.

723
01:15:42,718 --> 01:15:46,723
They came not knowing a lick of English and they learned English while working.

724
01:15:47,304 --> 01:15:49,667
It's not hard.

725
01:15:50,809 --> 01:15:58,479
It's just the resources need to be more available and the knowledge of what to do and where to get the stuff is very, very important.

726
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:03,760
Definitely.

727
01:16:04,100 --> 01:16:08,702
So I think this is a really worthwhile thing for us to work on.

728
01:16:08,722 --> 01:16:16,725
But I think it would be important to, like I said, talk with Catherine about it, just to make sure this is part of that.

729
01:16:16,745 --> 01:16:21,327
And she also thinks that it's an appropriate thing to work on.

730
01:16:21,747 --> 01:16:27,049
And I think she would probably have more resources than we do, or more information about this than we do.

731
01:16:28,089 --> 01:16:29,089
But I also think maybe,

732
01:16:30,898 --> 01:16:36,441
We could partner with someone, one of the economic development planners in my office.

733
01:16:38,302 --> 01:16:41,244
There are two people who work on economic development.

734
01:16:42,505 --> 01:16:45,687
So this might be something that they would be interested in working on too.

735
01:16:45,707 --> 01:16:55,753
I agree.

736
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:12,567
Anything else we want to talk about regarding workforce development, job connections?

737
01:17:19,173 --> 01:17:20,013
I think we're good.

738
01:17:25,337 --> 01:17:28,900
We can definitely talk to Catherine Wednesday about it too, Brenda.

739
01:17:29,441 --> 01:17:29,601
Cool.

740
01:17:32,113 --> 01:17:35,496
Um, and I think the next thing on their agenda was.

741
01:17:36,236 --> 01:17:39,639
Future meeting topics, yes.

742
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:47,425
Um, should we add just in some follow up about this for the next meeting?

743
01:17:48,105 --> 01:17:48,606
Absolutely.

744
01:17:49,787 --> 01:17:49,987
Yeah.

745
01:17:54,951 --> 01:17:55,071
Um.

746
01:17:57,020 --> 01:18:09,888
And then we had, we were talking about asking the tree warden to come to a future meeting, but we're still waiting on an updated trees tree ordinance or multiple.

747
01:18:09,968 --> 01:18:10,749
There are three of them.

748
01:18:11,549 --> 01:18:19,894
Um, so that might be more likely that that might be there for the next meeting, but it might not be.

749
01:18:20,014 --> 01:18:26,118
So I'll, I'll continue to keep that in mind and invite her once we have something to talk about.

750
01:18:30,780 --> 01:18:33,682
I have something on here that just says transportation topics.

751
01:18:34,583 --> 01:18:39,926
Is there something in particular that we wanted to invite the transportation director to talk about?

752
01:18:42,108 --> 01:18:45,150
What I feel like it was Stacy talked about that last meeting.

753
01:18:47,372 --> 01:18:50,614
But I don't remember since you bring that up.

754
01:18:55,179 --> 01:19:02,785
I think there's talk of them canceling the 94 route for the MBTA.

755
01:19:03,566 --> 01:19:04,166
Oh, OK.

756
01:19:04,207 --> 01:19:06,128
So talking about bus routes in particular.

757
01:19:06,829 --> 01:19:08,630
And how they're going to change.

758
01:19:08,710 --> 01:19:22,602
And what we can do is to kind of maybe stop that, since a lot of people kind of rely on those routes to get to where they need to go, whether it be work or other places.

759
01:19:26,590 --> 01:19:34,835
Yeah, and I know that our transportation director has been involved in those conversations with the MBTA and has really been advocating hard for this for the city.

760
01:19:36,596 --> 01:19:43,380
I think he's been very frustrated with well, how long that process takes because I think they've been talking about this for years.

761
01:19:45,322 --> 01:19:45,642
And just

762
01:19:47,278 --> 01:19:51,139
sort of the relative influence that he has there.

763
01:19:51,159 --> 01:19:56,821
But yeah, I can talk with him about maybe joining a future meeting to talk about that.

764
01:19:57,261 --> 01:20:01,803
Or at the very least, he can give me an update on it and I can share with you.

765
01:20:01,823 --> 01:20:04,123
Yeah, that would be nice.

766
01:20:04,443 --> 01:20:04,804
Thank you.

767
01:20:07,084 --> 01:20:08,585
Oh, Charbel, I couldn't quite hear that.

768
01:20:09,305 --> 01:20:10,845
Oh, I'm saying that would be nice.

769
01:20:11,005 --> 01:20:11,366
Thank you.

770
01:20:13,377 --> 01:20:38,263
like at least the 94 was like that was the bus that I would always take from from Medford from Medford Square to go to Davis Square and then I would take the red line to get to UMass Boston so that was like a very important route so I kind of it's kind of unbelievable that they're getting rid of that you know

771
01:20:40,944 --> 01:20:48,090
Yeah, I think there are people in my office who take that too, and they're going to be very frustrated.

772
01:20:55,515 --> 01:21:04,082
I would love to have put some time on the agenda to talk about sort of green giveaways at events.

773
01:21:07,230 --> 01:21:17,914
I know Lizette, you and I have talked about that a little bit, but I'd love to come back to the rest of the council and get feedback on what we've been talking about.

774
01:21:17,934 --> 01:21:19,075
Yeah.

775
01:21:20,295 --> 01:21:26,898
In all honesty, it's very hard to get giveaways in general.

776
01:21:26,998 --> 01:21:30,039
I don't know if you saw even the list I did, but it's hard.

777
01:21:34,398 --> 01:21:40,580
even like companies who like you can try to like buy things at least by bulk and be able to like be reusable.

778
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:41,200
It's hard to.

779
01:21:41,220 --> 01:21:43,801
Yeah.

780
01:21:44,241 --> 01:21:57,946
And then and one of the things I this came up because of the festival this past weekend where someone was saying it was better this year because last year there was a lot of plastic trash that they just didn't like their kids picking up at the tables.

781
01:21:59,667 --> 01:21:59,887
Yeah.

782
01:22:00,667 --> 01:22:02,168
But they were saying that

783
01:22:03,989 --> 01:22:18,215
Even if it is something that's disposable, having it be something that's not plastic, that's like cardboard or wooden or paper or something would be much better than having plastic.

784
01:22:18,716 --> 01:22:25,519
Oh, some of the feedback we got at the festival was deep cuts didn't have a vegetarian or vegan option.

785
01:22:26,239 --> 01:22:27,980
So the only food that was there

786
01:22:29,532 --> 01:22:34,261
was meat-based, which is like so against the message of the film.

787
01:22:37,271 --> 01:22:38,071
That's so funny.

788
01:22:38,612 --> 01:22:40,033
Yep.

789
01:22:40,673 --> 01:22:54,260
So, yeah, so we were talking about like, OK, so like in future years, we should have some sort of like write up of like, this is what we're requesting from vendors is like have at least one vegetarian or vegan option.

790
01:22:54,761 --> 01:22:54,961
Right.

791
01:22:55,421 --> 01:23:04,286
And maybe we could add to that, you know, have green giveaways at their tables and reduce the amount of trash and things like that.

792
01:23:04,426 --> 01:23:04,606
Yeah.

793
01:23:05,452 --> 01:23:11,714
Maybe each of us can come with like a list of like the things that we think can be an option.

794
01:23:11,734 --> 01:23:14,895
Then we can, when we have our next meeting, we can like share it.

795
01:23:17,335 --> 01:23:18,115
That's a great idea.

796
01:23:18,136 --> 01:23:18,216
Yeah.

797
01:23:30,151 --> 01:23:40,340
I think I promised you last time that I was going to give you an update on our greenhouse gas annual report, which I submitted, but I don't have good.

798
01:23:41,561 --> 01:23:43,983
I don't have easily.

799
01:23:45,084 --> 01:23:46,986
Shareable information on right now.

800
01:23:47,006 --> 01:23:50,029
I just haven't had the time to pull that together.

801
01:23:50,109 --> 01:23:52,491
So I'll try to do that for the next meeting too.

802
01:23:57,717 --> 01:24:24,382
And then for another one, I was brainstorming, I was thinking, I would love to just talk sort of at length about different ways that you guys are sort of meeting ESL residents where they are, because I know a lot of the things we're doing are, we're holding events and trying to pull people in, but I would love to be doing more

803
01:24:25,072 --> 01:24:28,614
like going to things where the people are already doing.

804
01:24:28,974 --> 01:24:30,155
And you might be doing that anyway.

805
01:24:30,175 --> 01:24:31,656
And I'm just not as aware of that.

806
01:24:38,899 --> 01:24:39,600
Does that make sense?

807
01:24:39,620 --> 01:24:41,801
Do you think that would be useful to talk about?

808
01:24:41,821 --> 01:24:53,187
Yeah, I mean, I feel like, like you said, now, like, we we do it either way, as well as like, in our own like, personal.

809
01:24:54,608 --> 01:24:54,808
But

810
01:24:55,626 --> 01:25:02,950
That could be something we can figure out a better way to get more people.

811
01:25:03,630 --> 01:25:04,291
Yeah.

812
01:25:04,691 --> 01:25:05,891
I think it would definitely help me.

813
01:25:05,931 --> 01:25:11,514
I'm not sure how much it would help you guys, but it would definitely help me as I'm thinking about outreach.

814
01:25:15,016 --> 01:25:18,578
Anything else you want to get on a future agenda?

815
01:25:24,303 --> 01:25:25,623
I don't think so, Brenda.

816
01:25:27,484 --> 01:25:28,564
I just looked at the time too.

817
01:25:28,644 --> 01:25:29,424
It's 7.06.

818
01:25:30,524 --> 01:25:31,264
That's true.

819
01:25:31,905 --> 01:25:33,365
And that's a lot of topics.

820
01:25:33,385 --> 01:25:35,465
That's more than we're going to do at the next meeting.

821
01:25:35,585 --> 01:25:37,506
So we're good for now.

822
01:25:43,427 --> 01:25:44,267
I think that's it then.

823
01:25:44,287 --> 01:25:46,187
Was there anything else folks wanted to talk about?

824
01:25:46,207 --> 01:25:51,849
I'm all set.

825
01:25:52,169 --> 01:25:52,789
Everybody else?

826
01:25:55,329 --> 01:25:56,210
I just have a question.

827
01:25:56,570 --> 01:25:58,411
I just have a question really quick.

828
01:25:59,192 --> 01:26:09,679
So the events that we do, is there anything that keep us from inviting religious place to have a table?

829
01:26:11,780 --> 01:26:15,963
Because I think that would be a good thing, because we're going to be reaching out to their communities too.

830
01:26:15,983 --> 01:26:20,306
And their religious leader can be bringing those information to there.

831
01:26:22,603 --> 01:26:29,626
maybe something that I can think about it, future events, invite them to the table and just talk about their places.

832
01:26:29,706 --> 01:26:30,086
I don't know.

833
01:26:31,447 --> 01:26:33,428
And get them involved with the community too.

834
01:26:35,929 --> 01:26:36,870
Yeah, absolutely.

835
01:26:37,130 --> 01:26:40,011
I don't think there's anything preventing us from doing it.

836
01:26:40,031 --> 01:26:41,352
And in fact, it might be the opposite.

837
01:26:41,372 --> 01:26:46,754
Because I remember a thing like, I don't know, at Boston City Hall where they had different

838
01:26:49,798 --> 01:26:53,100
Entities that they would organizations that they would host or whatever.

839
01:26:53,160 --> 01:26:57,983
And there was some sort of court case that was like, you have to, you know, fee.

840
01:26:59,684 --> 01:27:08,489
If you, if you invite some, you have to not invite, but if you are open to having some, you have to be open to having any organizations basically.

841
01:27:08,569 --> 01:27:08,749
Yeah.

842
01:27:09,891 --> 01:27:22,918
I do know that our work, you know, reach out to those organizations, you know, those churches and religious places, you know, like it's not necessary that all the residents go there, you know, most of the time they come from other towns.

843
01:27:23,719 --> 01:27:30,642
But I think we are reaching certain, you know, residents that we're not coming to any other thing in the city and stuff.

844
01:27:30,682 --> 01:27:34,785
So, or they're going to be bringing the message to their, you know, places.

845
01:27:34,845 --> 01:27:35,525
So maybe.

846
01:27:36,873 --> 01:27:44,457
Yeah, I have a contact list for, I think, all of the houses of worship in Medford.

847
01:27:47,038 --> 01:27:49,479
So it's long.

848
01:27:49,599 --> 01:27:50,580
There are a lot of them.

849
01:27:52,801 --> 01:27:59,845
But it's one of the things that I'm planning on doing through Electrify Medford is doing outreach.

850
01:28:00,667 --> 01:28:08,811
to the sort of the leaders of those different houses of worship and trying to get information out to their congregations that way.

851
01:28:10,111 --> 01:28:15,814
Yeah, well, you can come to them, you know, at the service and provide those information too.

852
01:28:19,575 --> 01:28:19,975
That's all.

853
01:28:20,596 --> 01:28:20,876
Thank you.

854
01:28:30,943 --> 01:28:32,424
Anything else folks want to talk about?

855
01:28:36,929 --> 01:28:39,671
So we'll need a motion to adjourn before we can end the meeting.

856
01:28:40,852 --> 01:28:41,132
Yes.

857
01:28:41,593 --> 01:28:43,795
Motion to adjourn the meeting guys.

858
01:28:44,816 --> 01:28:47,638
Aye.

859
01:28:48,579 --> 01:28:49,160
All in favor?

860
01:28:49,180 --> 01:28:51,081
Aye.

861
01:28:53,303 --> 01:28:55,045
That's a thumbs up from Charbel too.

862
01:28:55,065 --> 01:28:56,666
Natasha?

863
01:29:01,592 --> 01:29:02,974
I was looking for my thumb.

864
01:29:03,294 --> 01:29:03,915
Thumbs up.

865
01:29:03,995 --> 01:29:04,456
I'm done.

866
01:29:04,556 --> 01:29:05,197
I can't.

867
01:29:05,397 --> 01:29:06,038
Sounds good.

868
01:29:06,118 --> 01:29:07,159
Motion passed.

869
01:29:07,319 --> 01:29:07,640
Okay.

870
01:29:07,680 --> 01:29:08,821
Thanks, everyone.

871
01:29:08,861 --> 01:29:09,282
Thank you.

872
01:29:09,302 --> 01:29:13,006
Have a good night.
