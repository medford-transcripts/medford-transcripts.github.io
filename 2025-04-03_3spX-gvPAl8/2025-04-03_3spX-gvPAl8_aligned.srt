1
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:05,751
Good evening, everybody.

2
00:00:08,873 --> 00:00:13,197
Just going to give it a few minutes as people are coming in and connecting to audio.

3
00:01:03,143 --> 00:01:04,445
Good evening, everybody.

4
00:01:05,867 --> 00:01:11,195
I'm just going to give it a minute or two as people are logging on and connecting to audio.

5
00:02:13,663 --> 00:02:14,243
Okay.

6
00:02:15,304 --> 00:02:16,505
Well, good evening, everybody.

7
00:02:16,525 --> 00:02:20,087
I'm going to try and be mindful of time.

8
00:02:20,107 --> 00:02:27,672
I think we'll just start as some people are still kind of coming into the meeting and connecting to audio.

9
00:02:27,692 --> 00:02:33,096
We'll just start with the agenda and some introductions.

10
00:02:34,277 --> 00:02:36,038
Just want to say thank you for being here.

11
00:02:36,058 --> 00:02:40,021
Oh, but I'm sorry, I advanced a slide before.

12
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:41,462
Hold on one second, please.

13
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:53,080
This is what I get for trying to do too many things at once.

14
00:02:58,429 --> 00:03:00,252
I'll just do a reset as we're just kind of...

15
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:20,225
Okay, well, here we go.

16
00:03:32,934 --> 00:03:34,755
Thank you everybody for being here.

17
00:03:34,775 --> 00:03:36,657
Oops, sorry about that.

18
00:03:38,198 --> 00:03:38,558
Thank you.

19
00:03:40,728 --> 00:03:41,789
Okay, we're going to get started.

20
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:45,052
Sorry for that little brief tech tech issue.

21
00:03:46,233 --> 00:03:47,213
My name is Suzanne Galluzzi.

22
00:03:47,233 --> 00:03:48,675
I'm the interim superintendent.

23
00:03:49,175 --> 00:03:55,320
I thank you very much for joining us tonight so we can discuss the middle school lottery assignment and process.

24
00:03:56,421 --> 00:04:03,747
On the call tonight with us, we have some of our team members, and I just want to make sure that we introduce them before I get started.

25
00:04:04,908 --> 00:04:16,477
We have assistant superintendent Dr. Peter Cushing on the call, both middle school principals Jennifer Skane and Nick Tucci, and we have our communications director Will Pippicelli.

26
00:04:17,941 --> 00:04:20,642
And we thank all of you for joining us tonight.

27
00:04:21,202 --> 00:04:29,224
I'm going to just go through a very brief slide presentation to give a little bit of context to this process.

28
00:04:30,004 --> 00:04:34,665
And we're going to end with some questions and answers at the end.

29
00:04:35,685 --> 00:04:47,128
So if you could just hold your questions till the end, I'll stop the slide share and we'll have more of an opportunity for you to ask some questions and get some responses.

30
00:04:48,628 --> 00:04:52,669
So without further ado, I'm going to start with a little bit of the background.

31
00:04:53,469 --> 00:05:09,693
So before the spring of 2019, in Medford Public Schools, the middle school families used to have choice in the assignment of their child for grade six.

32
00:05:10,773 --> 00:05:13,975
This posed a lot of issues, especially over time.

33
00:05:14,716 --> 00:05:21,961
So what we started to see in Medford Public Schools was the enrollment totals were not the same from both middle schools.

34
00:05:23,662 --> 00:05:34,870
There was an issue because of that for overcrowding, which could also have some increased burdens on families and administration and just the functioning of the buildings.

35
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:44,314
First and foremost, though, there were some equity issues that were created when we also looked at the enrollment for both buildings.

36
00:05:45,354 --> 00:05:55,399
So when Dr. Maurice-Edouard Vincent came in as superintendent of schools, she created the lottery process to resolve a lot of these issues.

37
00:05:58,789 --> 00:06:05,253
So what we have in place right now was that policy that was created under her.

38
00:06:05,974 --> 00:06:08,415
That policy is as follows.

39
00:06:08,716 --> 00:06:23,866
So 50% of the fifth grade of each elementary school will go to the Andrews, and 50% of the fifth grade will go to the McGlynn Elementary School.

40
00:06:25,453 --> 00:06:45,178
If there is a student that is an English learner in need of English learner services or special education services at a program level, which I'll talk a little bit more specifically about in an upcoming slide, based on their needs, they will be placed at the middle school that offers that program.

41
00:06:47,299 --> 00:06:50,140
Students on IEPs that do not require

42
00:06:51,362 --> 00:06:58,567
program to meet the needs of their IEP will be distributed evenly between the Andrews and the McGlynn.

43
00:07:01,028 --> 00:07:12,996
Sibling preference is also something that we take into consideration when assigning students, but it does only apply to 5th grade students with a current sibling in grade 6 or 7.

44
00:07:14,923 --> 00:07:29,149
And we do build in some buffer seats through this lottery process, which I'll talk a little bit more about for the McGlynn Elementary School because of the needs of the EL program that's housed there.

45
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:40,995
So in terms of running the lottery process, there are going to be four exemptions that I just briefly highlighted.

46
00:07:42,477 --> 00:07:55,363
The first exemption in terms of placing students, or I should say maybe not having them part of the lottery, is any student that requires English learner services.

47
00:07:56,783 --> 00:08:00,825
The entire English learner program is housed at the McGlynn Middle School.

48
00:08:01,425 --> 00:08:08,408
And so any students requiring those services will automatically be assigned to the McGlynn Middle School.

49
00:08:09,329 --> 00:08:11,370
And therefore they will not be run in the lottery.

50
00:08:12,585 --> 00:08:20,147
The second exemption is for students that are on an IEP but require a specialized program.

51
00:08:22,108 --> 00:08:32,791
Many of you may know, and if you don't, a lot of our special education specialized programs are housed at the elementary level in different schools.

52
00:08:33,531 --> 00:08:35,812
At the middle school level, that is still the case.

53
00:08:36,052 --> 00:08:37,113
So for example,

54
00:08:39,691 --> 00:08:49,156
language-based programming, one of the classes is at the Andrews, one may be at the McGlynn.

55
00:08:50,056 --> 00:08:57,860
Connections, I believe, is at the McGlynn, but the therapeutic learning program is at the Andrews.

56
00:08:59,563 --> 00:09:11,427
If your child requires one of those specialized programs per their IEP, they will be placed at the middle school that offers that program or that houses that program.

57
00:09:12,008 --> 00:09:21,851
This is something that would be discussed at your team meeting with your special education team, which is facilitated by the ETL.

58
00:09:22,792 --> 00:09:26,433
Every student on an IEP, whether it's specialized programming

59
00:09:28,251 --> 00:09:31,393
or an IEP, will have a transitional meeting.

60
00:09:31,913 --> 00:09:37,477
If you have not had one already, there will be one that will be coming up before the end of the school year.

61
00:09:38,217 --> 00:09:48,984
And at that meeting will be the ETL, as well as maybe a coordinator, as well as the ETL of one of the middle schools to help talk through that process.

62
00:09:49,884 --> 00:09:53,907
I can answer more specific questions in the Q&A, but wanted you to be aware of

63
00:09:54,711 --> 00:10:05,374
If your child through IEP needs, requires a specialized program, that will be discussed and will not be run in the lottery.

64
00:10:05,414 --> 00:10:08,174
They will be placed at the school that houses that program.

65
00:10:09,595 --> 00:10:17,997
The third exemption is for students on IEPs that are not tied to a specialized program.

66
00:10:18,457 --> 00:10:23,318
The only exemption here is that students who are on an IEP to ensure equity

67
00:10:24,155 --> 00:10:40,268
in the assignment, we run a separate lottery for students on an IEP, because the needs of students on IEPs that are not tied to a specific program can be met at both middle schools.

68
00:10:41,368 --> 00:10:44,190
They can be met at the Andrews and they can be met at the McGlynn.

69
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:57,039
And so to ensure equity in our assignment process, we run a separate lottery for students on an IEP to ensure that there's equal distribution.

70
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,502
And then the last exemption is sibling preference.

71
00:11:02,563 --> 00:11:05,045
And so parents do have the right

72
00:11:06,903 --> 00:11:28,478
to opt their fifth grade student into a sibling preference if you have a child or if they have a sibling that is a current grade six or seven student, which means next year they would be in middle school with their sibling because they would be in grades seven or eight.

73
00:11:30,099 --> 00:11:32,601
I do think it's important to note that there are some

74
00:11:33,532 --> 00:11:35,733
clarifications to the sibling preference.

75
00:11:36,473 --> 00:11:41,534
One is that I just spoke about the specialized program needs.

76
00:11:42,595 --> 00:11:47,596
If your child requires a specialized program, that supersedes sibling preference.

77
00:11:49,857 --> 00:11:54,558
Sibling preference does not apply to younger siblings that are in McGlynn Elementary.

78
00:11:56,140 --> 00:12:04,187
And sibling preference does not include current eighth grade students as they will not be on the same campus for the school year 25-26.

79
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:14,395
Here is a link, it will be sent out to you separately, but we've also included here because we will make sure that the slide deck is on our website.

80
00:12:15,116 --> 00:12:22,282
And so if there is a Google form here, if you would like to opt into this.

81
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:32,686
So just to kind of explain a little bit more the lottery process, we have a sample elementary school here.

82
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:52,932
So if we are just going on the basis that an elementary school has 103 fifth grade students, just to give you a breakdown of how the lottery may go and what it may look like, if there are 20 students in that current fifth grade class that are EL,

83
00:12:53,911 --> 00:13:10,802
then they will automatically be going to middle school A. If eight of those students have sibling preference, then let's say one is going to middle school A and seven are going to middle school B because that's where their sibling preference lies.

84
00:13:12,824 --> 00:13:17,687
Three, require special education programming.

85
00:13:19,254 --> 00:13:34,643
Two of them require the program that's housed at middle school A, and so they are assigned to middle school A. One of those students requires a program that's housed in middle school B and will therefore be assigned to middle school B.

86
00:13:34,663 --> 00:13:39,486
12 of the 103 students in the fifth grade are on an IEP.

87
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:48,572
in addition to the three that I just mentioned in a specialized program.

88
00:13:49,252 --> 00:13:58,477
Those 12 will have their own lottery, and six will go to the Andrews, and six will go to the McGlynn.

89
00:14:00,357 --> 00:14:12,563
And then that would leave 60 students that would enter the general lottery, where we would poll so that those 60 students, half would go to the McGlynn, and half would go to the Andrews.

90
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:18,857
But I do think it's important to note that we do leave like a 3%, like three seats.

91
00:14:20,769 --> 00:14:34,619
per school for the McGlynn Middle School, because the nature of the EL programming, we have to make sure that we are meeting the needs as students are entering the district throughout the school year.

92
00:14:36,221 --> 00:14:44,787
So we do keep a small buffer there to ensure the numbers stay as close to balanced as possible.

93
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:58,723
And so just to review the lottery process timeline, which I know was sent out, but just so that we're all aware, the sibling opt-out, opt-in forms.

94
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:03,883
will be emailed to eligible caregivers tomorrow.

95
00:15:04,704 --> 00:15:12,990
There'll be a Google form on there for you to complete electronically if you, to let us know what your option is.

96
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:16,392
Would you like to opt in to sibling preference?

97
00:15:17,112 --> 00:15:19,114
Or no, you would not, you'll opt out.

98
00:15:20,755 --> 00:15:24,718
Monday is the deadline for those forms.

99
00:15:25,899 --> 00:15:26,959
Next Thursday,

100
00:15:28,047 --> 00:15:34,118
Your fifth grade child is going to come home with a letter in their backpack.

101
00:15:35,256 --> 00:15:38,177
that will have their lottery number on there.

102
00:15:38,217 --> 00:15:48,499
We assign every student a generic lottery number that we use like a random automized system here.

103
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:50,280
So they will come back.

104
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:55,501
This number is not attached to them within Medford Public Schools in any fashion.

105
00:15:55,561 --> 00:15:59,762
It is not their school identification number that we use.

106
00:15:59,942 --> 00:16:00,342
It is a,

107
00:16:01,302 --> 00:16:11,553
randomly generated number so that we can keep some confidentiality and make sure we're being random in the process.

108
00:16:13,765 --> 00:16:29,373
Then on Tuesday, April 15th, we will post the results on the district-wide website by 3 p.m., and caregivers are also going to receive an email with the link to the results that day.

109
00:16:30,113 --> 00:16:34,815
So on that day when we run the lottery, we just use a

110
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:42,738
random, automized platform, like a website, that helps us run the numbers.

111
00:16:43,338 --> 00:16:55,843
We will pull the lottery exactly as I detailed, so we will have a separate lottery for students on IEPs that are not tied to specialized program.

112
00:16:57,043 --> 00:17:07,428
programs, and then we will run a lottery for students from each school that are not tied to specialized programs.

113
00:17:08,749 --> 00:17:21,195
And then that list will be generated by student's number on the district website, and then more specifically with caregiver email on that day.

114
00:17:22,676 --> 00:17:31,942
And then the week of April 28th, you will get a hard copy letter sent to you in the mail.

115
00:17:33,123 --> 00:17:40,107
So that that way, caregivers are getting two ways that we're reaching out to you with the results of the lottery.

116
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:50,863
I also think it's important to note that both middle schools have their orientations the week following the hard copy letter coming home.

117
00:17:51,363 --> 00:18:01,206
So Wednesday, May 7th, will be the Andrews Middle School open house, and Thursday, May 8th, will be the Moglen School open house.

118
00:18:01,966 --> 00:18:03,846
Both start at 6 p.m.

119
00:18:04,206 --> 00:18:05,447
at the respective schools.

120
00:18:07,307 --> 00:18:08,948
I know that was a lot of information.

121
00:18:10,743 --> 00:18:20,747
I do think it's important to note here we are, there is a middle school lottery email, mslottery at medford.k12.ma.us.

122
00:18:22,247 --> 00:18:26,889
If you have any questions or any follow up, please use this email.

123
00:18:27,786 --> 00:18:40,373
as we're trying to keep, I want to be mindful in responding to questions and concerns and keeping this separate email is going to help us stay organized and responsive.

124
00:18:41,234 --> 00:18:47,777
So we will make sure that this is posted so that you're able to kind of access that link.

125
00:18:48,338 --> 00:18:55,662
I am going to stop screen sharing now so that I'm able to see participant faces and we're able to change the,

126
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:07,947
the settings here a little bit so that if people have questions, I believe Dr. Cushing is the chat sent just to us.

127
00:19:09,468 --> 00:19:09,589
OK.

128
00:19:09,909 --> 00:19:11,550
So we can monitor your chat.

129
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:16,213
If you have a question specifically in the chat, we can handle it that way.

130
00:19:17,074 --> 00:19:22,878
And otherwise, you can feel free to, can we allow people to?

131
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,641
They can request one mute.

132
00:19:27,683 --> 00:19:42,630
Great, so you can request to unmute and turn, you can request to unmute if you would like to ask a question live or you can put it in the chat and we can answer your questions directly through the chat.

133
00:19:46,262 --> 00:19:50,726
To clarify, yes, the EL is the English Language Learners Program.

134
00:19:50,746 --> 00:20:02,416
It's the English Learners Program, so students that require services and instruction in English because English is a second language to them.

135
00:20:09,582 --> 00:20:10,963
And if while we're waiting,

136
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:24,596
for questions to come in the chat or questions for people to request to unmute.

137
00:20:27,097 --> 00:20:32,520
If there are specific questions that maybe Mr. Tucci or Ms.

138
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:39,743
Skane or Mr. Pippicelli, who helps me monitor the MS lottery email,

139
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:45,986
may be recurring questions we can also answer as we're waiting.

140
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:51,490
Is the open house only for parents?

141
00:20:54,172 --> 00:20:57,795
Mr. Tucci and Ms.

142
00:20:57,815 --> 00:20:58,135
Skane.

143
00:20:58,693 --> 00:20:59,454
Yes, sir, certainly.

144
00:20:59,974 --> 00:21:11,524
So we would love to welcome the entire school community when you get your lottery information and your school identification to our open houses.

145
00:21:11,744 --> 00:21:16,187
So that's all caregivers as well as your students would be welcome to attend.

146
00:21:16,508 --> 00:21:18,049
And that's a really informative event.

147
00:21:18,489 --> 00:21:25,055
It gives us an opportunity to interact and understand our next round of incoming sixth graders and their families.

148
00:21:25,755 --> 00:21:34,485
And typically how that night goes, it starts in our auditorium or cafeteria and we welcome the group and then we embark on a scavenger hunt.

149
00:21:34,545 --> 00:21:44,617
We get a chance to meet grade level teams, to meet teachers, to explore the wide range of clubs and activities and offerings that we have at the middle school.

150
00:21:45,157 --> 00:21:47,419
And it's a really wonderful and informative evening.

151
00:21:47,719 --> 00:21:51,182
But this is just the first introduction to middle school that we provide.

152
00:21:51,202 --> 00:21:56,707
And we have many opportunities over the summertime to come into the school to get to meet your principal.

153
00:21:57,868 --> 00:22:00,009
And also we offer a summer orientation as well.

154
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:06,995
So we look forward to a lot of great transitional events to welcome the next crop of middle school students and families.

155
00:22:15,362 --> 00:22:19,025
Nick said it so well, so I'll just leave it at that.

156
00:22:24,389 --> 00:22:43,405
I do think it's important to note, as we're waiting, if more questions come into the chat, the topic of the middle school assignment process did come up at a lot of my meet and greets, especially at the elementary and the middle school level.

157
00:22:45,194 --> 00:23:02,099
I think it's important to note that in my transition into this role, part of my transition plan is to take a global look at enrollment at the elementary level.

158
00:23:03,171 --> 00:23:05,452
and the assignment process at the middle school level.

159
00:23:06,352 --> 00:23:17,537
And I think at the opening of this presentation, we explained kind of the historical background and the context for why this process was created.

160
00:23:18,197 --> 00:23:25,601
But I think that process was pre-COVID, and we definitely have seen a shift in our enrollment

161
00:23:26,821 --> 00:23:30,862
and the needs of our students in these past five to six years.

162
00:23:31,602 --> 00:23:49,206
And so one of the things that I am looking at is what this process would look like moving forward because we want to make sure that the process is meeting the needs of the students and the families and the district.

163
00:23:50,246 --> 00:23:54,807
And there's some room to grow here.

164
00:23:56,555 --> 00:23:59,134
So Rebecca would, do you have a question?

165
00:23:59,154 --> 00:23:59,657
Okay.

166
00:24:05,401 --> 00:24:05,761
Perfect.

167
00:24:05,801 --> 00:24:06,222
Thank you.

168
00:24:07,383 --> 00:24:09,525
I have so many questions, very honestly.

169
00:24:09,965 --> 00:24:11,266
Not so much about the lottery.

170
00:24:11,306 --> 00:24:14,970
I feel like that's going to be a flip a coin situation for my child.

171
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:18,613
But I'm just curious about middle school.

172
00:24:18,773 --> 00:24:22,636
When do we get a chance to learn about what middle school is like?

173
00:24:22,676 --> 00:24:26,520
The buildings are great and all, and the teachers are great, but what do we expect?

174
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:29,841
How, you know, what are the kids going to be learning?

175
00:24:29,981 --> 00:24:31,462
How, what's the vibe?

176
00:24:31,562 --> 00:24:34,023
What are things that parents need to be thinking about?

177
00:24:35,424 --> 00:24:42,847
You know, rumor has it we've got some interesting behavior profiles for this class of 2032.

178
00:24:43,207 --> 00:24:49,029
Like how is behavior management handled in middle school, you know, developmentally and so forth?

179
00:24:49,069 --> 00:24:52,591
So some of the, those are some of my big questions that I have coming in.

180
00:24:54,352 --> 00:24:57,773
So I don't know at what point we kind of get to start to talk about those things.

181
00:24:59,334 --> 00:25:00,995
No, that's a very thoughtful question.

182
00:25:01,095 --> 00:25:02,056
We appreciate that.

183
00:25:04,697 --> 00:25:12,461
I can just give the highlights, but I do think that this is important for the middle school principals to kind of respond to.

184
00:25:12,821 --> 00:25:19,225
But I think everything that you just said is that that initial piece is the open house.

185
00:25:19,525 --> 00:25:20,886
And I think that's kind of why

186
00:25:21,842 --> 00:25:38,450
you know, orientation, open house, it is an opportunity for students and caregivers to go to the school, yes, have a tour, but meet some of the staff and get to have a little bit more of an understanding about what middle school looks like.

187
00:25:41,431 --> 00:25:42,972
And so I think that's an important night.

188
00:25:43,392 --> 00:25:47,634
And then the pieces over the summer are also going to help with their transition as well.

189
00:25:49,335 --> 00:25:49,755
But I don't know

190
00:25:51,379 --> 00:25:55,121
Jen or Nick want to kind of like expand on that?

191
00:25:55,602 --> 00:25:56,002
I'd love to.

192
00:25:56,422 --> 00:26:02,106
From my end, one of the things I really work hard in preparation for the open house is to work with my student ambassadors.

193
00:26:02,807 --> 00:26:15,375
And we're really thoughtful about having some really great student ambassadors at the Andrews and the McGlynn as they prepare for the open house to feel the questions that are inevitably going to be coming, to help to reassure and prepare our caregivers and our students for

194
00:26:16,055 --> 00:26:17,896
you know, their transition to middle school.

195
00:26:18,796 --> 00:26:35,765
So I actually put a lot of work in with them to try to empathize with them, to say, think back to when you were going in to middle school and some of the questions that were coming up, some of the things you were nervous about, like opening a locker or managing homework or managing the expectation of all these different teachers.

196
00:26:36,445 --> 00:26:51,012
And, you know, position yourself to be able to answer the questions from the community and the feedback we oftentimes will get is that the students and the student ambassadors are really the stars of the show, and they're really informative with helping our school community and make this transition to middle school.

197
00:26:52,433 --> 00:26:53,815
Middle school is a really fun time.

198
00:26:53,975 --> 00:27:03,485
It's a time that we really, you know, specialize in certainly and working with this age of adolescence and we understand the great responsibility it takes to be able to meet the needs of all of our students.

199
00:27:03,585 --> 00:27:12,774
And, you know, I am super excited to once again, you know, lead the middle school, the transition to the from the fifth grade is the sixth grade at the McGlynn Middle School.

200
00:27:12,814 --> 00:27:13,155
I know Ms.

201
00:27:13,175 --> 00:27:14,056
Skane is too as well.

202
00:27:14,736 --> 00:27:24,383
The students will be balancing all their different subjects from math to English to social studies to science and the wide array of exploratory opportunities and clubs, activities and sports that we have to offer.

203
00:27:25,244 --> 00:27:28,206
They come into their own, and it's really great to support them in that effort.

204
00:27:28,886 --> 00:27:31,328
As it relates to school discipline matters, Ms.

205
00:27:31,348 --> 00:27:33,029
Gane and I, we really work hard.

206
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:38,812
have a really united approach and we use a lot of the same tools to be able to support our students.

207
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:54,599
Tools from sometimes some punitive measures, working certainly collaboratively with teachers and our community and our parents, but also a lot of restorative practices too as well to be able to engage our students and capturing some important teachable lessons.

208
00:27:55,319 --> 00:27:57,160
So thank you for the thoughtful question.

209
00:27:57,621 --> 00:28:02,463
And I know it's hard to answer in just this quick setting here, but stay tuned for lots of great information.

210
00:28:02,503 --> 00:28:07,446
And we look forward to inspiring our students and helping them get excited about middle school and what's to come.

211
00:28:09,327 --> 00:28:10,328
Jen, did you want to?

212
00:28:11,274 --> 00:28:24,040
Yeah, I'll add that I think Mr. Tucci and I have worked very hard to collaborate so that students' experiences at either middle school are pretty similar.

213
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:28,781
We try to offer the same opportunities for students.

214
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:36,885
So I think that students would share that while we probably have some different personalities in the building, I think

215
00:28:37,425 --> 00:28:41,648
both experiences from feedback from students is a positive one.

216
00:28:42,569 --> 00:28:47,512
And I also want to just share that I agree with Suzanne.

217
00:28:48,253 --> 00:28:50,414
We understand that there's so many questions.

218
00:28:50,995 --> 00:28:57,880
Nick and I both start very early in the summer reaching out with some important like as you transition information.

219
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:02,141
that helps both parents and students be prepared for that transition.

220
00:29:02,581 --> 00:29:15,303
But I also want to say our 6th grade teams are really essential in that process because they understand what the 6th grade transition is like for students, and they do a lot of things to support that process.

221
00:29:17,404 --> 00:29:20,364
Since you're still unmuted, Ms.

222
00:29:20,384 --> 00:29:27,906
Skane, can you also talk about how students and families find out information specifically about clubs, sports, and activities?

223
00:29:28,689 --> 00:29:28,969
Sure.

224
00:29:29,569 --> 00:29:38,151
So both Nick and I, around the same time usually, we prepare during, students have a wind block during their schedule.

225
00:29:38,831 --> 00:29:54,315
And during that wind block within the first month of school, they will have an opportunity to attend a activities fair where they will get an opportunity to see all of the different activities, learn a little bit more about them, speak to students who are part of those activities.

226
00:29:54,815 --> 00:30:03,642
And the nice piece about both middle schools is that we have some activities that are independent for each of us, that each one of us has the same type of club.

227
00:30:04,143 --> 00:30:14,891
But if one school has a club that the other student, other school doesn't, students are welcome to go over to the McGlynn afterschool or come over to the Andrews afterschool.

228
00:30:14,931 --> 00:30:17,793
So they have many more opportunities available to them.

229
00:30:20,456 --> 00:30:21,056
Thank you.

230
00:30:21,657 --> 00:30:22,137
You're welcome.

231
00:30:24,597 --> 00:30:27,818
So, Peter, can you check the chat?

232
00:30:28,058 --> 00:30:30,098
Because I think you're getting a lot.

233
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:43,141
The one I'm going to say specifically, especially, you know, a lot of us are parents on this call as well.

234
00:30:43,721 --> 00:30:48,502
So I know my youngest would have been the one that the letter never came home from school.

235
00:30:51,909 --> 00:31:12,962
that is the case for you and your child doesn't come home with a letter that has their number on it, please make sure that you reach out to the MS Lottery email and we will be able to give you your child's number so that you have that ahead of the draw if you're tracking it on the website.

236
00:31:13,683 --> 00:31:18,566
That's one of the reasons why we made sure we set up a specialized email for that.

237
00:31:22,154 --> 00:31:23,075
I just want to jump in.

238
00:31:23,656 --> 00:31:26,539
We had a parent talk about twins.

239
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:30,363
So twins are a fairly unique situation.

240
00:31:30,804 --> 00:31:35,169
Generally speaking, they're assigned their own unique number.

241
00:31:35,589 --> 00:31:38,433
And if the draw places them at the same school, then the

242
00:31:39,153 --> 00:31:41,595
the deed is done and they're placed at the same school.

243
00:31:42,155 --> 00:31:57,865
If by chance they're placed at both schools, meaning twin one is at the Andrews and twin two is at the McGlynn, by nature of sibling preference in the past, what we've done is we've allowed the family to make the choice as to which school they will actually attend so the children are not split up.

244
00:31:58,246 --> 00:32:04,750
The family can choose, and this has happened in the past, for they land where they land and that's where they're going to go.

245
00:32:08,072 --> 00:32:08,392
Say again.

246
00:32:09,033 --> 00:32:09,954
Pending enrollment.

247
00:32:10,254 --> 00:32:10,454
Yes.

248
00:32:10,875 --> 00:32:11,975
Yep.

249
00:32:12,316 --> 00:32:27,789
And as far as anyone with an IEP, if there's a specialized placement, that's something that we would be able to have a conversation about as far as sibling preference as well, pending enrollment.

250
00:32:27,909 --> 00:32:35,576
But generally speaking, the lottery is allowed to do what it needs to do to try to split students up evenly.

251
00:32:36,822 --> 00:32:50,614
Could you also since this pertains to you, could you just talk a little bit about the bus, the busing in terms of is there a certain mileage to all students?

252
00:32:53,864 --> 00:33:12,210
It is, generally speaking, busing over two miles for students, but the buses all come and pick up in the afternoon at the Andrews, so students from the McGlynn will walk over, generally speaking.

253
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:15,332
Mr. Tucci, Mr. Bruno and Ms.

254
00:33:15,372 --> 00:33:16,533
Lally and Ms.

255
00:33:16,813 --> 00:33:22,318
Skane are out there along with teachers as students make the journey over to the Andrews.

256
00:33:23,258 --> 00:33:27,201
Students are dropped between the two schools in the morning, same location.

257
00:33:28,302 --> 00:33:38,030
So we are definitely able to provide transportation under the approved distances within the district.

258
00:33:43,893 --> 00:33:45,174
I'm just trying to read the chat here.

259
00:33:45,194 --> 00:33:58,940
And I just add, we also offer late bus transportation three days a week so that students can stay for extra help or they can become a member of one of the many clubs or activities.

260
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:01,650
It was a question about curriculum.

261
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:03,671
Curriculum is unified across the district.

262
00:34:04,752 --> 00:34:06,572
So just want to be clear about that as well.

263
00:34:07,392 --> 00:34:13,875
And while each school has its own unique feel, the curriculum your child gets is based on the Massachusetts state frameworks.

264
00:34:14,375 --> 00:34:18,976
And as I mentioned, adopted uniformly across grades six, seven, and eight.

265
00:34:25,299 --> 00:34:28,140
And I think that's all the questions we have right now in the chat.

266
00:34:43,121 --> 00:34:51,089
So just to reiterate, we're going to keep monitoring the chat, but I do want to thank you all for taking time out to be here tonight.

267
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:55,434
You can still put your questions in the chat.

268
00:34:55,554 --> 00:35:03,782
You can still ask to turn your camera on, ask to be unmuted to ask a question that way, or you could always follow up.

269
00:35:04,423 --> 00:35:14,048
with a question to mslottery at medford.k12.ma.us, and we'll make sure that we get back to you in a timely manner.

270
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:29,637
So just to reiterate, clubs run both at each individual middle school and some of them run jointly, collectively, so that students from the McGlynn,

271
00:35:30,434 --> 00:35:34,895
and the Andrews join together in the club.

272
00:35:35,196 --> 00:35:45,999
So it's a little bit of everything.

273
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:57,662
Mr. Tucci, would you like to talk about maybe how we select what clubs and sports are run?

274
00:36:01,677 --> 00:36:06,322
I think like teachers can make recommendations and participation.

275
00:36:07,425 --> 00:36:17,809
Yeah, so every year we go through a process where we certainly like to pride ourselves in having opportunities for students to voice their opinions and perspectives.

276
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:25,152
And oftentimes we will consider adding to our array of clubs and activities, given maybe certain student interests.

277
00:36:25,713 --> 00:36:26,513
So I'll give an example.

278
00:36:27,834 --> 00:36:30,575
This past year at the McGlynn Middle School, we added a Lego club.

279
00:36:30,995 --> 00:36:35,237
And there has been really significant interest in being able to have that club at our school.

280
00:36:36,037 --> 00:36:45,019
And just this spring, after a significant amount of interest from my student body, we just added an outdoor soccer club that we'll be starting next week.

281
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:55,221
So oftentimes, as long as there's interest in having or hosting a club, we'll find a way to put together a club or an activity to be able to support our students.

282
00:36:55,301 --> 00:36:58,042
And we want to keep them involved in the life of our school.

283
00:36:58,742 --> 00:37:01,204
And, you know, to reiterate something that Ms.

284
00:37:01,224 --> 00:37:08,989
Skane and Dr. Glusi had mentioned before, we like to also pride ourselves on having clubs and activities and sports being shared between the two schools.

285
00:37:09,129 --> 00:37:23,799
We recognize that maybe some students may end up going to a different school, whether it be the Andrews or McGlynn, and they look forward maybe to a club or activity that they can spend time with, with a peer that they had a great connection with, maybe in their neighborhood or one of their elementary schools.

286
00:37:24,399 --> 00:37:32,125
So certainly we love to pride ourselves on having a really great array of clubs and activities that are geared to the current student level of interest.

287
00:37:32,145 --> 00:37:37,829
Thank you.

288
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:39,150
Of course.

289
00:37:53,333 --> 00:37:57,376
So just to reiterate, I think maybe one or two people might have popped on a little bit later.

290
00:37:57,456 --> 00:38:12,847
We went through a presentation that just kind of provided a little context to the lottery process, which will be posted on our website so that you can see that information, as well as have access to any of the links that are live.

291
00:38:13,787 --> 00:38:18,811
We're now kind of just answering some questions you may have about the process or about middle school.

292
00:38:21,109 --> 00:38:23,430
Dr. Galussi, another question did just come in.

293
00:38:24,451 --> 00:38:38,877
So in the twins, as I've worked with this previously, if they do end up in the same middle school, you can definitely work with the principals to have conversations, you know, trying to make sure that each child has their own unique experience with twins.

294
00:38:38,897 --> 00:38:43,900
You know, we've definitely had parents say like, oh, can I make sure they're on different sides or,

295
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,821
something along those lines.

296
00:38:46,061 --> 00:38:51,545
And Principal Tucci or Principal Skane, if you'd like to further add, but that's generally speaking how we've done it in the past.

297
00:38:53,117 --> 00:38:53,657
Absolutely.

298
00:38:53,738 --> 00:38:57,761
We've had work with families before where they would like to have maybe a twin on the same side.

299
00:38:59,002 --> 00:39:01,964
I've had families say that I'd like to have my twins in the same classes.

300
00:39:02,745 --> 00:39:11,391
Other families might be like in a situation where they said, I'd like to be able to have the twin on one side of grade six and the other side of grade six.

301
00:39:11,852 --> 00:39:18,537
And then maybe we could sprinkle in a few exploratory classes where they might have some of those classes together.

302
00:39:19,078 --> 00:39:25,107
So we can really kind of work with families to, you know, usually tailor it to meet the needs of individual students.

303
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:29,534
We try to do that all day, every day to meet the needs of our students.

304
00:39:29,594 --> 00:39:32,118
And we want to work collaboratively with our caregivers to do so.

305
00:39:42,362 --> 00:39:49,247
There's a question that's come up about the list of clubs and whether or not there is a school newspaper.

306
00:39:49,407 --> 00:39:56,313
So currently the Andrews does not have a school newspaper, but that does not mean that we would not consider it.

307
00:39:58,294 --> 00:40:05,260
As Mr. Tucci talked about, I had a student who came to us this year and was super excited about the Future Cities Club.

308
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:08,002
So we had students who started that club and

309
00:40:08,741 --> 00:40:11,642
They competed in Boston and did a great job this year.

310
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:25,229
So we are open to having different ideas and different, you know, students definitely have their own set of interests and needs and they do change as different students come around.

311
00:40:25,249 --> 00:40:36,314
I do have a list of clubs on, I believe it's on our website, but if not, I will check and make sure that it is there, that you could look, I don't know,

312
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:45,117
Mr. Tucci, if you have the same, I think you do, you could look right under the activities under the more information on our webpage.

313
00:40:50,619 --> 00:40:50,799
Yeah.

314
00:40:54,304 --> 00:40:58,567
One of the things I'll just mention is we don't have a school newspaper either, but we actually have a media club.

315
00:40:59,227 --> 00:41:00,488
And it's really wonderful to see.

316
00:41:00,728 --> 00:41:05,371
But our students, they play broadcasters, essentially, at the McGlynn Middle School.

317
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:08,133
And they broadcast what's called our McGlynn Morning News Show.

318
00:41:08,373 --> 00:41:18,579
And it's great to be able to see them create a wonderful morning show to help to broadcast announcements and really enrich our school environments and promote our school culture, too, as well.

319
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:22,942
So we really value our students participating in the life of our school.

320
00:41:26,717 --> 00:41:27,198
Thank you.

321
00:41:28,759 --> 00:41:30,181
I don't have any more questions.

322
00:41:31,763 --> 00:41:35,848
Dr. Cushing or everybody else, do we have any more questions in the chat?

323
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:40,033
Just about sides.

324
00:41:46,119 --> 00:41:50,743
Right now, the current structure at middle school, and Ms.

325
00:41:50,763 --> 00:41:56,929
Skane and Mr. Tucci can elaborate a little bit more, but there are two sides to every grade level, right?

326
00:41:57,009 --> 00:42:10,981
So if you just look at a grade six team at the Andrews, there's side A and side B. So basically you're taking the entire grade six cohort per building, and you're breaking them up into two different teams.

327
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:14,761
They have the same classes.

328
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:25,124
It's just two different teams of teachers so that we're making sure that we're meeting the needs of students and balancing enrollment.

329
00:42:26,384 --> 00:42:29,285
And the teams function as cohorts throughout the year.

330
00:42:29,325 --> 00:42:37,528
So I think caregivers will have a lot of communication from the team of teachers throughout the year.

331
00:42:39,159 --> 00:42:41,402
Um, yeah, opportunity.

332
00:42:41,943 --> 00:42:55,200
So their team is mostly for their core subjects, but students do have an opportunity to kind of mix within both teams for their United Arts or Unified Arts or exploratory as well as world language.

333
00:43:08,205 --> 00:43:10,368
Okay, well, thank you again so much for coming.

334
00:43:11,669 --> 00:43:14,292
We appreciate you and your thoughtful questions.

335
00:43:16,888 --> 00:43:27,638
If you have any more specific questions, please reach out to the MS lottery at medford.k12.ma.us and we can answer your questions there.

336
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:37,167
And we look forward to thoughtful transitions for your children and hope you have a wonderful rest of the evening.

337
00:43:37,827 --> 00:43:39,009
Thank you so much for coming.
