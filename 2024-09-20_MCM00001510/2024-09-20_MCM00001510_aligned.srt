1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:01,311
Hi, everybody.

2
00:00:01,331 --> 00:00:02,772
My name is Steve Smerdy.

3
00:00:02,952 --> 00:00:05,255
I'm the Director of Communications for the City of Medford.

4
00:00:05,275 --> 00:00:11,521
I might just wait a minute or two, just if there are any other people hopping on before we kind of get underway here.

5
00:00:11,541 --> 00:00:12,822
All right.

6
00:00:13,503 --> 00:00:19,709
So we're here today to talk about the Green Line Zone program that we're working on.

7
00:00:19,809 --> 00:00:21,551
It's going to go to the Traffic Commission next month.

8
00:00:23,144 --> 00:00:29,206
I'm here with our special projects coordinator, Jim Silva, and our director of traffic and transportation, Todd Blake.

9
00:00:30,106 --> 00:00:37,888
And so today they're going to give a presentation on the program and go over kind of the timeline of things.

10
00:00:38,028 --> 00:00:40,409
And then there's going to be a Q&A session afterwards.

11
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:43,730
So please hold all your questions until the Q&A session.

12
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,851
You can either use the hand emoji, if you're familiar with that.

13
00:00:47,891 --> 00:00:50,292
You can go into reactions on the bottom of your Zoom.

14
00:00:51,352 --> 00:00:55,154
and just stay and add your hand up and then we'll get to you that way.

15
00:00:55,275 --> 00:00:57,936
Or you can also put your question in the chat and we'll get to it there.

16
00:00:57,956 --> 00:01:08,142
I want to remind everybody that this presentation, as well as this recording of this meeting, will be available on our website sometime tomorrow.

17
00:01:08,242 --> 00:01:10,364
So you can go check it out there, probably on the parking page.

18
00:01:10,444 --> 00:01:12,305
And we'll also put it on the home page for a little bit.

19
00:01:13,706 --> 00:01:17,008
Okay, so without further ado, I'm going to kick it over to Jim and Todd.

20
00:01:19,657 --> 00:01:24,300
Hi, I'm Jim Silva, special project coordinator for Mail Lungo Kern in her office.

21
00:01:24,561 --> 00:01:34,367
I'm also the Green Line proposal representative of the person who is the contact for this pilot project.

22
00:01:35,348 --> 00:01:39,150
And all of your questions will be directed at me, to me rather.

23
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:40,411
I'm J.F.

24
00:01:40,451 --> 00:01:43,933
Silva at Medford-MA.gov.

25
00:01:44,654 --> 00:01:50,257
I'm going to be helping with the proposal tonight along with Todd Blake, our Transportation Director.

26
00:01:51,157 --> 00:01:51,437
Todd.

27
00:01:54,279 --> 00:01:54,799
Thanks, Jim.

28
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:57,681
Steve, can you bring up the slides?

29
00:01:58,902 --> 00:01:59,162
Thanks.

30
00:02:01,726 --> 00:02:02,447
Welcome, everyone.

31
00:02:02,487 --> 00:02:06,489
We'll try to be brief so we can get to the Q&A if anyone has questions.

32
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:09,351
And we are here for you at your disposal.

33
00:02:09,411 --> 00:02:13,794
So hopefully, after hearing this brief presentation, you'll understand the program.

34
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:17,384
Yeah, so we'll get underway.

35
00:02:17,484 --> 00:02:21,048
Obviously, today is March 13, 2024, 6 p.m.

36
00:02:21,068 --> 00:02:22,970
City Met for public information meeting.

37
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:29,896
As others had said, it's regarding the proposed Green Line Transit Area Permit Parking Zone.

38
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:37,583
So that's what this informational meeting is about, the Green Line Transit Area Permit Parking Zone that is being proposed.

39
00:02:39,565 --> 00:02:41,506
Next slide, please, Steve.

40
00:02:41,946 --> 00:02:44,087
Next, we're just going to flash the map up quickly.

41
00:02:44,107 --> 00:02:54,072
We have some other things to say, but we wanted to flash the map up quickly first because you may have heard about the meeting from someone else, and you may have thought it was about your area.

42
00:02:54,112 --> 00:02:54,793
Maybe it isn't.

43
00:02:55,213 --> 00:03:05,698
So we wanted to flash this up on the screen because we're only speaking about streets, permanent parking on streets within this blue zone that's depicted on this map here.

44
00:03:06,459 --> 00:03:07,459
So it's roughly,

45
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:21,621
It's roughly Winthrop Street on the west side, George Street on the north, Main Street and Medford Street to the kind of the east, south is Broadway, Somerville, but excludes that obviously.

46
00:03:21,641 --> 00:03:32,110
And so just generally wanted to state that because we have had some meetings in the past couple of years that involve neighborhoods that are beyond this area.

47
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:35,032
So if you live beyond the blue line, none of this will,

48
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:37,254
impact your change in any way.

49
00:03:37,274 --> 00:03:42,495
We're only speaking about the area that's located within this blue designated area.

50
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:44,996
Next slide.

51
00:03:49,178 --> 00:03:53,859
So yeah, this is a slide that kind of explains the project timeline.

52
00:03:54,520 --> 00:04:00,462
So some of you may think that this proposal is new, but it's actually been in discussions for

53
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:19,694
eight plus years now starting with the study the city had a consultant do back in collected data in 2016 presented it in 2017 about on-street residential parking program options and in that study it referred to zoned parking or district parking in 2020

54
00:04:22,045 --> 00:04:40,379
Mayor Brianna Lungo-Curran, she formed an advisory commission, and the commission was called the Parking Policy and Enforcement Commission, and it was an advisory commission to investigate parking issues and hear from residents themselves and business owners themselves.

55
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:42,641
So it's a community-driven process.

56
00:04:43,692 --> 00:05:01,040
with the intent to develop a report that would be given to the city based on all the information that they heard throughout that process and communicate that and boil it down and synthesize it into recommendations from that community-driven group to the city.

57
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,541
And this is one of those recommendations.

58
00:05:04,021 --> 00:05:11,064
And I just wanted to point out that the co-host, Jim Silva, was a part of that commission, a co-chair of that advisory commission.

59
00:05:13,894 --> 00:05:17,938
So, and then I wanted to the next thing, so that was in March 21.

60
00:05:18,599 --> 00:05:23,644
The commission policy enforcement presented their findings and report and recommendations.

61
00:05:24,525 --> 00:05:29,410
So, there's some other things that may seem somewhat unrelated, but they're parking related.

62
00:05:30,051 --> 00:05:31,452
Chief Buckley and I held a.

63
00:05:32,133 --> 00:05:40,557
community meeting in June of 2022 to help folks give some folks that may live on private ways information about parking on private ways.

64
00:05:41,898 --> 00:05:52,203
After this meeting at your leisure if you live on a private way you could go to the city's parking page which will should have a link to a private way page and it has a

65
00:05:52,963 --> 00:05:57,224
It should have a recording of that meeting that we held back in June 22.

66
00:05:57,264 --> 00:06:00,325
So if anyone has additional questions about private ways, that's where you should go.

67
00:06:01,766 --> 00:06:08,168
Then after that, there were several meetings and processes that happened, one of which was this area.

68
00:06:08,188 --> 00:06:19,791
We had a meeting back in 22, 23 to, there were some streets in this area that's being proposed that were not yet permit parking.

69
00:06:20,191 --> 00:06:21,152
So at that time,

70
00:06:22,172 --> 00:06:42,775
um in saving their community and the residents in those areas that may still be on the street that didn't have permanent parking in this area we saved them the hassle of having to do an individual petition and getting signatures to get permit and we just changed uh 15 streets at that one time in this blue zone that didn't formally have current parking

71
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:46,117
that now have had parent parking for I think over a year now.

72
00:06:46,798 --> 00:06:54,802
So some other steps, there's some technology advances that the parking department and other departments within the city have upgraded.

73
00:06:54,922 --> 00:06:57,823
There are some processes that were kind of streamlined.

74
00:06:58,924 --> 00:07:09,389
So all in an attempt to make parking more usable for residents, give preferential treatment to city residents, and try to

75
00:07:10,235 --> 00:07:12,816
prevent or limit others from parking in the area.

76
00:07:12,876 --> 00:07:16,638
So we're trying to help in that regard in terms of the limited parking supply.

77
00:07:18,919 --> 00:07:22,481
So some of the other timeline points here are

78
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:38,301
So after this community meeting in March 24, the plan is to have this as an agenda item on the traffic commission meeting on April 9th, 2024 at 5 p.m.

79
00:07:40,062 --> 00:07:48,810
If that got approved at that time, then whatever needs to be ordered in terms of equipment will be ordered, and the rollout, if approved, would start July 1st.

80
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:49,231
Next slide.

81
00:07:54,906 --> 00:08:01,209
So I'm going to hand it over to Jim Silva to talk about some of the benefits of going to zone permit parking.

82
00:08:02,589 --> 00:08:07,251
Some of the benefits listed, the preferential access to on-street parking.

83
00:08:08,212 --> 00:08:13,994
The program is built to prevent long-term parking by non-residents on a residential street.

84
00:08:15,055 --> 00:08:19,076
It provides also alternative parking locations within short distance.

85
00:08:20,077 --> 00:08:22,858
Enforcing by zone is much more resource efficient.

86
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:30,916
There are few overlapping variances, and it's an equitable parking without limiting the number of permits issued.

87
00:08:31,876 --> 00:08:45,382
There is no changes to the current permit renewal system, no changes to the visitor pass system, and the program data gathered will be evaluated to best meet the residents' needs.

88
00:08:47,203 --> 00:08:47,683
Next slide.

89
00:08:50,931 --> 00:08:54,432
So we're just gonna discuss a little more in detail about the zone.

90
00:08:55,192 --> 00:08:58,033
We want to highlight as well that this is a pilot program.

91
00:08:58,994 --> 00:09:09,357
So we'll go into next steps later, but this would be essentially a test case, a pilot program would reevaluate after that pilot is finished, if approved.

92
00:09:09,818 --> 00:09:16,240
So the light blue streets indicated on this map are all public streets within the zone.

93
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:22,501
And as I mentioned earlier, all of those public streets in the zone already have permit parking.

94
00:09:23,462 --> 00:09:25,042
So they're already signed as permit parking.

95
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:27,343
You already need to get a permit to park there.

96
00:09:27,863 --> 00:09:30,443
You've all done that already, I'm sure, in the past year.

97
00:09:30,923 --> 00:09:32,524
So none of that will change for you.

98
00:09:33,904 --> 00:09:39,626
The only difference is instead of just being able to park on one of the light blue streets, you'll be able to park at any of the light blue streets.

99
00:09:41,366 --> 00:09:46,114
So the pink streets on here just indicating the private ways that exist within the zone.

100
00:09:46,935 --> 00:09:54,186
The red lines on this map indicate the areas that are currently paid apart, they have a kiosk you pay for daytime parking.

101
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:59,692
And then some of the other things we wanted to point out were the exclusion.

102
00:09:59,712 --> 00:10:03,775
So some of the blue borders go along a street, like say George Street.

103
00:10:04,135 --> 00:10:08,318
So we have notes here if it excludes or includes that street that's on the border.

104
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:17,505
So for instance, George is excluded, but if you were a corner house and you had a variance to park within the light blue area already, that would remain the same.

105
00:10:18,305 --> 00:10:20,467
The east side of Winthrop Street is included.

106
00:10:21,307 --> 00:10:24,830
The East Capon Street near Tufts campus is excluded.

107
00:10:25,903 --> 00:10:27,545
It excludes Broadway-Somerville, of course.

108
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:29,208
It excludes Pearson Road-Somerville.

109
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,312
It excludes Main Street.

110
00:10:33,714 --> 00:10:42,726
It does include Medford Street, which is from Tufts Square south towards Magoon Square-Somerville, but only on the Medford side, obviously.

111
00:10:43,547 --> 00:10:49,292
and then it includes Bow Street and includes Dexter Street, the block between Lagoon Square and Bow Street.

112
00:10:50,113 --> 00:10:51,815
So that's what's included.

113
00:10:51,975 --> 00:10:58,981
Hopefully, this is more clear than some of the information you had before in terms of the graphics and the legibility of it.

114
00:10:59,401 --> 00:11:01,703
And this will also be available on the city's web page.

115
00:11:01,764 --> 00:11:05,627
So if you want to refer back to it, you will be able to.

116
00:11:08,412 --> 00:11:10,633
So I think that covers it, Jim.

117
00:11:10,673 --> 00:11:12,615
I'm going to pass it back to Jim for the next slide.

118
00:11:12,635 --> 00:11:17,497
So what we want to talk about next is what doesn't change.

119
00:11:17,517 --> 00:11:21,980
All other areas outside of this zone remain street by street.

120
00:11:22,961 --> 00:11:24,822
All approved variances remain.

121
00:11:25,862 --> 00:11:28,244
Your resident parking pass remains the same.

122
00:11:29,378 --> 00:11:34,406
The visitor passes issue remain the same and are only good for the street issued on.

123
00:11:35,368 --> 00:11:38,233
And enforcement value remains either 24-7, 24-6, or as posted.

124
00:11:42,654 --> 00:11:48,656
If your sign has a value except Sunday and holidays, you're a 24-6.

125
00:11:49,537 --> 00:11:58,200
If your sign has no mention of the limitations, you're a 24-7 or as posted and be posted on the sign.

126
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:02,142
So it's pretty easy to navigate and those will maintain.

127
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:04,523
Next slide.

128
00:12:08,385 --> 00:12:15,347
Some of the next steps is the Traffic Commission meeting on Tuesday, April 9th, 2024 at 5 p.m.

129
00:12:16,128 --> 00:12:17,568
This again is a proposal.

130
00:12:17,788 --> 00:12:19,709
This proposal is informational.

131
00:12:20,209 --> 00:12:24,790
It provides you with this information, which will be proposed at that particular meeting.

132
00:12:25,871 --> 00:12:32,393
The Traffic Commission is the regulatory commission that regulates all traffic and parking on public streets and public lots.

133
00:12:33,495 --> 00:12:41,714
Zoom link and other info will be provided via the city events calendar and the city's webpage at medfordma.org slash events.

134
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:47,430
There'll be implementation, if approved, there'll be implementations of new signs.

135
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:59,375
At this time, the current plan is to modify the existing permit parking signs within the zone and the letter G for Greenline Parking District will denote the zone.

136
00:12:59,776 --> 00:13:01,917
And we'll have an example of that a little later on.

137
00:13:01,937 --> 00:13:05,978
The start date, we're looking at fiscal year 2025, which begins July 1st, 2024.

138
00:13:12,274 --> 00:13:28,325
At that time, during the pilot, we'll evaluate based on the data perspective and the fact that we will be adding a C-Click fix called private public pilot.

139
00:13:28,986 --> 00:13:33,369
And we'd like you to report using the C-Click fix application.

140
00:13:33,589 --> 00:13:38,552
So if this is approved, that will become available and will be very helpful with data gathering.

141
00:13:40,814 --> 00:13:41,274
Next slide.

142
00:13:45,133 --> 00:13:50,376
So now we're going to just look at some of the commonly asked questions that we may have received.

143
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:54,999
So hopefully this may answer some questions you may already have.

144
00:13:55,900 --> 00:14:02,043
So the first one is, what does the change mean in terms of residents outside the zone being able to park in the zone?

145
00:14:02,364 --> 00:14:03,384
So this is a common one.

146
00:14:04,025 --> 00:14:05,886
I think there's some fair perception that

147
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:12,128
people further away from the zone will now be able to drive to your area and park near the train or something like that.

148
00:14:12,188 --> 00:14:13,249
That is not the case.

149
00:14:13,389 --> 00:14:14,449
That is absolutely not the case.

150
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:21,232
Anyone outside the blue line, outside the zone, will still have whatever they had before.

151
00:14:21,713 --> 00:14:25,194
If they're in the northern part of the city, they're not part of the permit program.

152
00:14:25,294 --> 00:14:32,097
If they're just outside the line in South Medford Hillside in their street-by-street zone, they'll continue to have their street-by-street zone.

153
00:14:32,597 --> 00:14:41,423
So anyone from outside the blue area that wishes to park inside the blue zone, the green line zone, they would essentially be a visitor.

154
00:14:41,443 --> 00:14:49,849
And if they knew you or were visiting you, they would use your visitor pass, just as they would if they were not on your street today and went to your street.

155
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:52,251
So hopefully that clears that up.

156
00:14:53,272 --> 00:14:59,896
Is the city considering using windshield stickers to denote cars that have permits like some other communities do?

157
00:15:01,232 --> 00:15:04,261
so that anyone can identify what cars belong on the street.

158
00:15:05,224 --> 00:15:07,411
So at this time the city of Medford doesn't issue stickers.

159
00:15:08,728 --> 00:15:15,850
We use what's known as a certain license plate technology that scans the license plate and then everything's coded by your license plate.

160
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:29,713
So whereas before, or with the sticker program, the enforcement agent might look at the sticker on your windshield, this just scans your license plate and it gives them all the necessary information of what address the car is registered to.

161
00:15:30,113 --> 00:15:37,635
And then if that car is registered to the street in the zone, it will be coded in such a way that it knows that that street is in the zone.

162
00:15:38,555 --> 00:15:41,737
So it's ready to go in terms of implementation if it's approved.

163
00:15:42,717 --> 00:15:43,237
Let's see.

164
00:15:43,397 --> 00:15:48,940
And then the city will always continue to re-evaluate its parking processes.

165
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:53,662
So we take all feedback and we're constantly trying to improve for everyone.

166
00:15:53,682 --> 00:16:04,367
The third one, how does the district parking help workers who come to this area, district-wide parking, better meets the needs of residents and workers, frequenting, self-measuring.

167
00:16:04,747 --> 00:16:05,408
So basically,

168
00:16:06,248 --> 00:16:30,636
by making, you know, the city's parking supply as efficient as possible, then potentially some people that, you know, it could improve availability, with the potential improved availability for resident on-street parking, business customers, employees may have a better time finding availability in pay-to-park areas or other parking that's currently available to those users.

169
00:16:31,456 --> 00:16:32,057
So, you know,

170
00:16:33,197 --> 00:16:35,758
The number of streets we have isn't getting any larger.

171
00:16:35,778 --> 00:16:38,359
The number of spaces, we're not necessarily going to have more spaces.

172
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:53,006
So the best way to best utilize our infrastructure for city of Medford residents is to manage it as best we can, which the permanent parking program does do that by eliminating people that don't live in Medford from parking on our city streets, right?

173
00:16:53,286 --> 00:16:59,969
So it's one level of control the city has to help its residents with that limited supply.

174
00:17:00,929 --> 00:17:02,750
Will there be a change in enforcement?

175
00:17:03,191 --> 00:17:04,632
There'll be no change in enforcement.

176
00:17:05,572 --> 00:17:13,016
The days and times of enforcement will remain the same based on the sign or restriction that's on your streets.

177
00:17:13,056 --> 00:17:15,958
So 24-7, 24-7, 24-6, be 24-6 or otherwise post it.

178
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:20,040
If there's like loading zones and things like that, those will all remain the same.

179
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:24,583
If there's no parking areas, same as before and after if the zone got approved.

180
00:17:25,944 --> 00:17:29,706
What does this mean for people living on a street that's marked red on the map?

181
00:17:31,515 --> 00:17:33,876
We received this question email.

182
00:17:34,236 --> 00:17:35,157
So it was a good question.

183
00:17:35,337 --> 00:17:40,159
The red line on the map that we showed earlier, and we could circle back to it and show it again if needed.

184
00:17:41,099 --> 00:17:45,721
That just describes the area that's currently paid to park from 8 to 6 PM.

185
00:17:46,601 --> 00:17:48,242
And it's currently unrestricted overnight.

186
00:17:48,902 --> 00:17:53,744
So those particular areas currently do not require a permit to park at night.

187
00:17:53,944 --> 00:17:55,725
And they will not as part of this.

188
00:17:56,465 --> 00:17:57,306
They'll remain the same.

189
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:57,366
So.

190
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:07,497
But if you live on one of those streets, you're in the zone, you'd be eligible to buy a resident parking pass.

191
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,841
The last question.

192
00:18:12,063 --> 00:18:16,065
Are there any measures the city can take to help prevent vehicles from parking too close to private drives?

193
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:18,906
This is a common question regardless of this proposal or not.

194
00:18:20,246 --> 00:18:31,991
So at times, people that park on street, no matter if it's in this zone or elsewhere, they may park within so close to your curb cut that's hard for a person with a driveway to enter or exit their own driveway.

195
00:18:32,371 --> 00:18:35,953
There is an existing rule that you're not supposed to park within two to three feet of a curb cut.

196
00:18:36,613 --> 00:18:41,155
and the parking department or police department can issue citations for that when they enforce.

197
00:18:42,236 --> 00:18:49,139
If in the more rare case, if someone's completely blocking your driveway and it's impassable, that's a safety violation.

198
00:18:49,159 --> 00:18:52,940
You should call the police department at the number listed here.

199
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,862
Hopefully that covers some of the questions you may have.

200
00:18:58,283 --> 00:18:59,923
We realize it doesn't cover every question.

201
00:18:59,963 --> 00:19:01,484
That's why we still have a Q&A period.

202
00:19:02,304 --> 00:19:03,645
So next slide, please, Steve.

203
00:19:07,007 --> 00:19:20,773
So as Jim mentioned, his contact info is listed here, his email, and there will be this presentation as well as other references to other points of information will be provided on that parking website.

204
00:19:24,097 --> 00:19:24,557
Next slide.

205
00:19:25,918 --> 00:19:31,379
We're going to open up to Q&A in a few moments, but we wanted to highlight some of the potential examples of signs.

206
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:42,602
This hasn't been finalized, but basically these are all four signs that exist in that zone right now, with the two on the left and the one on the right being the most common.

207
00:19:43,785 --> 00:19:53,055
The one with the two hour is in areas like Medford Street, where there are some businesses that overlap with residential areas, but these are all the existing signs in this zone.

208
00:19:53,736 --> 00:20:05,129
So the thing that would change would be the G sticker would be somewhere on the sign, and it would denote to the customer, the user, the resident, as well as the enforcement folks, if you're in the zone or not.

209
00:20:11,382 --> 00:20:14,624
So I think we'll start to open it up to questions.

210
00:20:17,186 --> 00:20:21,248
Would the city of Memphis be open to considering adding a Green Line Zone sticker in the future?

211
00:20:21,268 --> 00:20:25,591
I think we mentioned that as one of the frequently asked questions.

212
00:20:26,432 --> 00:20:30,254
The city is always open to receiving feedback, and we'll consider that.

213
00:20:30,294 --> 00:20:33,436
But at this time, we use license plate technology.

214
00:20:33,456 --> 00:20:35,638
That does not require a sticker.

215
00:20:38,657 --> 00:20:42,601
Let's see, next one is Alexander's one.

216
00:20:43,922 --> 00:20:47,105
If there aren't stickers, how would residents report in C-Click Fix?

217
00:20:48,707 --> 00:20:49,888
Jim, do you want to handle that one?

218
00:20:50,189 --> 00:20:54,553
C-Click, what was the, you wanted the data in C-Click Fix to refer to?

219
00:20:57,917 --> 00:21:00,580
If there's increased availability on this street or not, or?

220
00:21:01,841 --> 00:21:04,423
What we're looking to do is to compare some data.

221
00:21:04,824 --> 00:21:11,589
So reporting that on the C-Click Fix is what we're asking people to do to accommodate during the pilot program if it's approved.

222
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:13,090
And that would be helpful.

223
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:18,455
We can do some comparisons over the last two years, but also react accordingly and report.

224
00:21:21,677 --> 00:21:29,384
So I guess to wrap that up in a vote is whatever you would do now if you called or reported on C-Click Fix, you would still do in the future.

225
00:21:30,283 --> 00:21:34,764
So there would be no change in how you do it, or just asking you to continue to do it.

226
00:21:35,624 --> 00:21:40,585
So right now, Pearl Street is signed for permanent parking on both sides of the street, but the practice is for people parking on the right side of the street to park on the sidewalk.

227
00:21:40,605 --> 00:21:41,545
Will this change?

228
00:21:56,688 --> 00:21:58,313
with the zone permit program.

229
00:21:59,075 --> 00:22:01,481
So any areas that

230
00:22:02,267 --> 00:22:08,572
maybe like this would be handled on a case-by-case basis regardless of if the zone is approved or not.

231
00:22:09,132 --> 00:22:13,695
So I would say that it's not tied to whether the zone goes forward or not.

232
00:22:14,356 --> 00:22:26,504
If there's an issue that someone wants to raise that may be a safety issue or an accessibility issue like that, then we would take that and the traffic commission and the city would take that on a case-by-case basis regardless of if it's zoned or not.

233
00:22:30,881 --> 00:22:33,782
The next one is, I guess, what exact problem is this solving?

234
00:22:33,802 --> 00:22:35,123
Why is this better than we currently have?

235
00:22:35,743 --> 00:22:38,164
So right now, it's a little more equitable.

236
00:22:38,224 --> 00:22:45,668
Some streets, very few, may have parking only on one side of the street or near side of the street due to travel lanes.

237
00:22:48,512 --> 00:22:50,693
You know, some streets have availability on both sides of the street.

238
00:22:50,733 --> 00:22:59,717
But basically, right now, if you came home from work and, you know, there were a limited number of spaces on your street, sometimes it may be completely full occasionally.

239
00:23:00,018 --> 00:23:08,342
So this would enable you the option to park on a neighboring street for yourself, for the residents of the zone to be more flexible instead of

240
00:23:09,082 --> 00:23:15,244
taking the chance and parking on a different street and get a ticket or having to circle around for a good amount of time to find a space.

241
00:23:15,285 --> 00:23:19,066
So it just enables the people that live in the zone a little more flexibility.

242
00:23:19,666 --> 00:23:21,747
It's not that you would do that every time.

243
00:23:21,807 --> 00:23:25,589
It's only in those rare cases where there's nothing available for yourself.

244
00:23:25,749 --> 00:23:31,291
It would give you an option, an alternative next within the zone if a nearby street

245
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:35,744
So it gives more flexibility for the people who live in the zone.

246
00:23:36,626 --> 00:23:38,188
Right now, it's very restrictive.

247
00:23:38,969 --> 00:23:47,580
Medford's is one of the most restrictive programs that we're aware of in terms of the state and possibly in the country with the street by street system.

248
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,382
So it's very unique.

249
00:23:51,164 --> 00:23:57,231
It's not very common in areas that are in dense populated areas near transit.

250
00:23:58,652 --> 00:24:06,701
If I could just reiterate the question, the previous question in regards to a vehicle that may have number of tickets on it, etc.

251
00:24:06,881 --> 00:24:11,386
They would still report that information to the police and that's the way that they were produced.

252
00:24:12,026 --> 00:24:16,968
We would do the C-Click fix if there is issues just reporting it through that.

253
00:24:17,028 --> 00:24:21,949
But all reports of cars with tickets on them, multiple tickets, it's a safety issue.

254
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:26,391
It will continue to go to the Chief of Police or the Police Department at 395-1212, area code 781.

255
00:24:31,375 --> 00:24:31,915
Thank you, Jim.

256
00:24:31,995 --> 00:24:39,341
The other to circle back just one more sec to the other of what exact problems is solving besides more flexibility for the people who live there.

257
00:24:39,721 --> 00:24:46,045
It's also more resource sufficient for the processes for people who may live in right now.

258
00:24:46,105 --> 00:24:50,808
You may need to go to the traffic commission to get a variance to park on a nearby street.

259
00:24:50,868 --> 00:24:51,009
This.

260
00:24:51,689 --> 00:25:00,812
this may negate that for some, it will reduce the number of variances, reduce the number that the city has to track and that the residents have to come in for yearly.

261
00:25:01,253 --> 00:25:09,796
So it's making it a much more cohesive and easy system for the users that it's supposed to be for to help.

262
00:25:10,336 --> 00:25:12,377
So again, permanent parking programs in general,

263
00:25:13,832 --> 00:25:16,234
or for the city resident benefits.

264
00:25:16,274 --> 00:25:22,458
So it's to make it preferential for them to use the public streets versus someone who may not live in the city.

265
00:25:22,718 --> 00:25:24,860
And in this case, won't live in that zone.

266
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:29,883
So let's see some of the next questions.

267
00:25:30,263 --> 00:25:32,825
Okay.

268
00:25:34,646 --> 00:25:40,170
I'm curious whether the parking problem will beef up enforcement of violators of resident only parking.

269
00:25:42,565 --> 00:25:48,310
I live slightly outside the area on the map, and I will tell you that unfortunately resident parking in my area is non-existent.

270
00:25:48,791 --> 00:25:50,872
I'm at Tesla, which is Tufts University.

271
00:25:51,333 --> 00:25:54,155
We really have zero tickets given on the street.

272
00:25:55,957 --> 00:26:03,183
So as we said before, whatever levels unfortunately exist today, that's the level of resources we have.

273
00:26:03,843 --> 00:26:05,585
whether the zone goes forward or not.

274
00:26:06,005 --> 00:26:10,629
But again, this helps being more efficient with enforcement.

275
00:26:10,649 --> 00:26:15,133
So we hope that things will improve and we're always striving to improve as a city.

276
00:26:15,594 --> 00:26:17,535
And we look forward to more feedback like that.

277
00:26:17,896 --> 00:26:26,583
And that's one of the measures that we'll be reevaluating to see if the public perception of enforcement has changed at all.

278
00:26:26,623 --> 00:26:30,186
And hopefully we'll address that.

279
00:26:31,613 --> 00:26:35,854
Apologize to everyone for all the distractions that are going on.

280
00:26:37,895 --> 00:26:49,438
I think we should probably keep all the questions in the chat, just for whatever reason.

281
00:26:49,698 --> 00:26:51,278
This is kind of devolved here.

282
00:26:51,298 --> 00:26:57,240
If you have any other questions, please just put them in the chat and we'll try to get to them.

283
00:27:02,275 --> 00:27:03,096
All right.

284
00:27:03,736 --> 00:27:06,218
Do we want to go to Bobby Delfano at all?

285
00:27:07,939 --> 00:27:10,501
If we see the person, do we want to take the chance or not?

286
00:27:11,001 --> 00:27:11,522
I'd rather not.

287
00:27:11,542 --> 00:27:17,146
I think if you can just enter your text in the chat, that would be much more easier for us.

288
00:27:18,707 --> 00:27:19,007
OK.

289
00:27:19,227 --> 00:27:22,790
I'll continue with the chat.

290
00:27:24,731 --> 00:27:25,852
What about from Diane?

291
00:27:25,872 --> 00:27:28,974
There isn't enough parking on my street now for the residents who live on it.

292
00:27:28,994 --> 00:27:30,936
This is just going to make it harder for people who live here.

293
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:38,632
Sorry, it keeps bumping down on my screen.

294
00:27:44,016 --> 00:27:45,037
Can you repeat that, Steve?

295
00:27:45,117 --> 00:27:46,739
It keeps bumping down on my screen.

296
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,041
Oh, sorry.

297
00:27:49,061 --> 00:27:57,729
There isn't enough parking on my street now for the residents who live on it.

298
00:27:57,789 --> 00:28:00,231
This is just going to make it harder for the people who live here.

299
00:28:02,937 --> 00:28:06,079
So the intent is to make it easier for people who live there.

300
00:28:06,299 --> 00:28:11,462
So again, within the zone, primarily you're going to park closest to your house every day when you come home, right?

301
00:28:11,823 --> 00:28:20,948
And then only in those cases where it's full, it gives you a little more flexibility to park elsewhere within the zone, within your neighbors, within your neighbor's streets.

302
00:28:21,409 --> 00:28:26,632
It's the intent is to help all the permanent parking programs that exist in Massachusetts, throughout the country.

303
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:32,671
have the intent of helping the residents to make it preferential for them.

304
00:28:33,331 --> 00:28:42,554
One thing that we want to make clear, and this, again, is not unique to Medford, is the supply on the street and the permit process doesn't guarantee you a space.

305
00:28:43,074 --> 00:28:49,397
The number of people looking for spaces may exceed what's available on the street, and that's not uncommon.

306
00:28:49,877 --> 00:28:56,659
But it limits the competition with just your residents and neighbors and not people from out of town or elsewhere.

307
00:28:57,239 --> 00:28:59,380
So that's what the Permapark program is supposed to help.

308
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:13,685
If the Permapark program didn't exist at all, every street would be available to anyone and everyone who drives through the city and wishes to park there.

309
00:29:14,825 --> 00:29:17,066
Steve, if you could help pick up the next one.

310
00:29:17,146 --> 00:29:17,707
Yeah, sorry.

311
00:29:21,713 --> 00:29:25,135
Let's see, we live down the dead end portion of Burgett Avenue.

312
00:29:25,155 --> 00:29:27,616
I'm sorry, this is quite long.

313
00:29:27,636 --> 00:29:32,779
A lot of kids on the street and they like to ride bikes.

314
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:35,860
I understand the need to be equitable on street parking.

315
00:29:39,162 --> 00:29:49,527
Seems like it would make sense to do the inverse of what is proposed, have a small exclusionary zone and high traffic targets like the Green Line and then open all the other streets to other Medford residents.

316
00:29:51,001 --> 00:29:52,842
This is from Rob.

317
00:29:52,882 --> 00:29:59,663
So if this is the one that referenced Burgett, so Burgett is obviously one of the streets that are a little closer to the Greenline station or one of the Greenline stations.

318
00:30:00,684 --> 00:30:09,846
But the zone as currently drawn, we believe it is small enough that it won't incur folks that are further away to potentially drive to your street.

319
00:30:10,286 --> 00:30:16,568
Everything within the zone is within a 12-minute walk of one of the three transit stations that are nearby.

320
00:30:17,268 --> 00:30:19,870
And that's the outer perimeter of the blue zone.

321
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:25,554
The average distance to a transit station within the blue zone is more like a seven minute walk.

322
00:30:26,455 --> 00:30:35,802
So it was intentionally drawn within roughly a quarter mile of the transit stations to not capture people that may be further away that want to come to your area.

323
00:30:36,262 --> 00:30:39,405
So it does not include the entirety of South Medford Hillside.

324
00:30:39,965 --> 00:30:46,550
It's just the blue zone, which is within about 3,000 feet or less of the transit station.

325
00:30:57,958 --> 00:31:01,039
I think Sarah, who has her hand up, had something in the chat.

326
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:01,219
Oh, OK.

327
00:31:02,639 --> 00:31:07,080
Can you hear us, Sarah?

328
00:31:08,381 --> 00:31:09,061
Oh, yeah.

329
00:31:10,081 --> 00:31:10,421
Let's see.

330
00:31:10,441 --> 00:31:11,062
Did I unmute?

331
00:31:11,082 --> 00:31:11,282
Sorry.

332
00:31:13,083 --> 00:31:15,584
I'm out of my realm of, like, usually I'm on my computer.

333
00:31:16,465 --> 00:31:19,286
I've just written a few things that I think have been replicated by others.

334
00:31:19,406 --> 00:31:20,126
I apologize.

335
00:31:20,166 --> 00:31:24,769
I just got off of work, so I'm a little bit late to some of the dialogue.

336
00:31:25,149 --> 00:31:28,811
But I also live on Berga, and, I mean, we don't have a problem now.

337
00:31:29,291 --> 00:31:33,113
And opening this up, it's like, you don't have to worry about parking us straight over.

338
00:31:33,173 --> 00:31:33,853
We're fine.

339
00:31:34,293 --> 00:31:41,537
But this is a huge concern of my neighbors, and I unfortunately feel like you just are repeating the same answer to all of us back and forth.

340
00:31:44,387 --> 00:31:47,295
It's kind of frustrating to actually not feel like this is a dialogue.

341
00:31:47,956 --> 00:31:52,127
So, yeah, we'll try to say it in a different way to there's a perception that.

342
00:31:53,288 --> 00:32:03,075
because of this, that there'll be this influx of cars that will suddenly park on your street, no matter which street you're on, Burgett or some other street.

343
00:32:03,515 --> 00:32:11,760
And I think that's just some maybe natural way of thinking of it, kind of what will be the impact.

344
00:32:12,401 --> 00:32:14,722
But we don't believe that to be the case.

345
00:32:14,742 --> 00:32:20,326
Other programs throughout other regions, other communities, that's not necessarily the case.

346
00:32:21,705 --> 00:32:23,746
So can I just interrupt you for a second?

347
00:32:23,766 --> 00:32:27,868
Because I mean, I lived for years in both Brookline and in Charlestown.

348
00:32:28,028 --> 00:32:31,609
And I'm sorry to disagree with you, but that was not my experience.

349
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:34,791
I would have to rush home or hurry up that I was going to have to get to a place.

350
00:32:35,131 --> 00:32:35,611
I'm fortunate.

351
00:32:35,631 --> 00:32:36,252
I have a driveway.

352
00:32:36,292 --> 00:32:38,933
I'm trying to advocate for all of my neighbors who have to park on the street.

353
00:32:40,253 --> 00:32:45,676
So I guess I agree to disagree in my experience over the past 20 years of living in Boston.

354
00:32:51,485 --> 00:32:52,846
Okay.

355
00:32:53,866 --> 00:32:58,868
It's just one of those things we've heard from some other streets that have the same type of concern.

356
00:32:58,908 --> 00:33:11,533
They think that the two neighboring streets will suddenly park on their street, but then the next street over, they think the same thing, that those two neighboring streets will park on their street, when it's essentially likely that people are still going to park closest to their house.

357
00:33:12,113 --> 00:33:13,673
It only gives a little more flexibility.

358
00:33:13,773 --> 00:33:18,675
It's not going to be, whatever number of permits exist today, exist before or after the zone.

359
00:33:19,215 --> 00:33:19,976
So whatever,

360
00:33:20,796 --> 00:33:36,432
number of cars that are vying for these spaces it's similar before after so this is very similar to other programs and you mentioned brookline as an example brookline is i believe district for zone parking as well boston is district zone parking so this isn't

361
00:33:37,399 --> 00:33:40,380
Medford's not blazing a new trail here.

362
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,321
We're not starting from scratch.

363
00:33:42,961 --> 00:33:43,861
These things exist.

364
00:33:44,121 --> 00:33:50,524
Industry-wide transportation, parking industry, these are common programs that exist.

365
00:33:50,824 --> 00:33:52,504
And obviously, I was right to disagree.

366
00:33:53,065 --> 00:33:54,665
So next.

367
00:33:54,685 --> 00:33:56,546
I think Jeremy had a question.

368
00:34:01,099 --> 00:34:02,559
Thank you, Steve.

369
00:34:03,099 --> 00:34:08,601
I'm a resident on Charnwood Road, and I understand my neighbors on Burgetts and other streets' concerns.

370
00:34:08,641 --> 00:34:18,603
I can say, as one of those people who I think they may fear my drive over to park closer to the T, I can say, we and our neighbors really have no intent of doing that.

371
00:34:18,663 --> 00:34:27,005
And so support this trial and to see how it goes, and let's learn from it and see what works and what doesn't.

372
00:34:27,085 --> 00:34:28,065
Support the city in that.

373
00:34:29,739 --> 00:34:38,961
But I also want to say that I think parking is only half of the issue with the new Green Line station, or with the area around the Green Line station.

374
00:34:39,822 --> 00:34:52,705
This has been brought up in the Medford master planning process and in other forums, but the city needs to make an effort to improve the sidewalks and the street along Boston Avenue and in the vicinity of the T stations.

375
00:34:54,105 --> 00:34:58,768
woefully inadequate for people driving, for people on bikes, for people on foot.

376
00:34:59,948 --> 00:35:08,633
If you get off of the Tufts T, you're in a vast wasteland of cars with no clear way to cross the street.

377
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:24,777
And it's really disappointing that we're spending a lot of time talking about parking and have yet to hear any plans from the city about how those urban realms and sidewalks and bike lanes and frankly, the parking that exists on Boston Avenue is bad.

378
00:35:25,617 --> 00:35:27,818
We haven't heard any plans about how that would be improved.

379
00:35:28,278 --> 00:35:30,859
So we'd like to hear more from the city on those fronts.

380
00:35:31,219 --> 00:35:31,479
Thank you.

381
00:35:33,543 --> 00:35:37,206
Thank you for your feedback regarding parking and the other things.

382
00:35:38,307 --> 00:35:41,330
So the city does have a complete streets policy.

383
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:48,976
And, you know, our apologies if you don't notice some of the changes happening, but we are trying to catch up.

384
00:35:50,037 --> 00:35:52,380
With safety improvements for all modes.

385
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,462
That's why the complete use policy exists.

386
00:35:54,482 --> 00:36:00,609
So we're trying to improve pedestrian access as well as bicycle access and making it safe for everyone.

387
00:36:00,849 --> 00:36:02,571
Bicycle pads and transit users.

388
00:36:03,012 --> 00:36:04,213
So there are a number of projects.

389
00:36:04,594 --> 00:36:06,756
So, like, for instance, the college that.

390
00:36:07,617 --> 00:36:11,679
Boston Ave location that is a traffic signal that is actuated.

391
00:36:11,759 --> 00:36:12,560
You could press the button.

392
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,720
It's right off the train station.

393
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:16,842
You can press it, get a walk signal, stops all traffic in every direction.

394
00:36:18,002 --> 00:36:19,863
There's future projects as well.

395
00:36:19,923 --> 00:36:24,706
So the crosswalk that exists about halfway down between College Ave and Winthrop Street.

396
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:44,260
So if you came out of Charnwood and went up Winthrop and took the left onto Boston Ave, there's a capital improvement program to improve the signal at Winthrop Street in Boston Ave, and then there's a capital improvement project related to Green Line mitigation to improve the mid-block crossing at the Tufts Garage where the emergency egress is.

397
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,041
So that would be halfway down the street.

398
00:36:47,262 --> 00:36:52,307
There are several capital programs going throughout the city in terms of improving sidewalks.

399
00:36:53,488 --> 00:37:04,439
The city unfortunately is playing catch up with a backlog of sidewalk repairs over years of not keeping up with maintenance, so we have the city under

400
00:37:06,523 --> 00:37:19,571
in the past few years have created a capital plan which didn't exist in a lot of years prior, and each year it shows how many millions of dollars we have of sidewalk work to do, and we're chipping away at that, but it's going to take some time.

401
00:37:20,131 --> 00:37:28,656
So we do recognize and hear that comment and concern, and we hope that you see improvements each additional year.

402
00:37:29,237 --> 00:37:33,379
I know you have a follow-up, Jeremy, and I'll get to you, Bobby, right after, okay?

403
00:37:33,399 --> 00:37:34,300
I know you've been waiting.

404
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:34,760
Sorry about that.

405
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,042
Thank you and I appreciate the comments Todd.

406
00:37:39,282 --> 00:37:44,767
I just put in the chat that just last night I was biking home on that stretch through that intersection.

407
00:37:44,787 --> 00:37:50,071
You're talking about there are cars that are parked double parked in front of the T station.

408
00:37:50,551 --> 00:37:54,455
There's no sharrows there as ineffective as they can be.

409
00:37:56,216 --> 00:38:02,698
This stuff was needed a year ago before the T opened and the crosswalks are inadequate.

410
00:38:03,318 --> 00:38:05,779
I just think there needs to be more priority on it.

411
00:38:06,039 --> 00:38:10,100
So I'd really love to know where I can find more information about those projects that are in progress.

412
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,781
I've searched the city website.

413
00:38:11,821 --> 00:38:12,441
I can't find it.

414
00:38:14,421 --> 00:38:19,082
So I think that the city needs to be more transparent about what's planned there, share that information.

415
00:38:19,502 --> 00:38:25,964
It would satisfy these neighbors who are forced to walk through these unacceptable conditions right now.

416
00:38:26,224 --> 00:38:26,564
Thank you.

417
00:38:27,424 --> 00:38:27,784
And I'm done.

418
00:38:27,804 --> 00:38:28,064
Thanks.

419
00:38:28,545 --> 00:38:28,785
Thanks.

420
00:38:28,825 --> 00:38:31,185
There is a transportation page on the city website.

421
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:33,666
It doesn't necessarily include every single thing going on.

422
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:35,866
We're constantly trying to update it and add things.

423
00:38:36,146 --> 00:38:39,567
The map behind me is one of them showing all the safety improvements we've been doing.

424
00:38:39,887 --> 00:38:41,948
But specifically on College Ave,

425
00:38:43,688 --> 00:38:58,939
We have had a bike lane approved to connect the bike lane that's now on George Street to the City of Somerville bike lane that's on College Ave, just around the vicinity of Professor's Row, so it would pass right by the T Station.

426
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,841
So that just hasn't been implemented yet.

427
00:39:02,241 --> 00:39:11,167
And now it might, the implementation of that may be delayed a little bit more because Tufts University usually gets all their construction projects in the summer months when the students are out.

428
00:39:11,587 --> 00:39:15,090
So they're planning on some work in College Ave as well.

429
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:18,171
So we just have to line up the timing of that.

430
00:39:18,231 --> 00:39:24,673
But there's a project to include bike lanes in stretches on College Ave where it could fit the bike lane instruction.

431
00:39:24,713 --> 00:39:26,133
It will have a bike lane instruction.

432
00:39:26,473 --> 00:39:31,074
And then in areas where it's too narrow to have a bike lane instruction, it will have an uphill direction.

433
00:39:31,575 --> 00:39:32,815
And the downhill will be the Shero.

434
00:39:33,415 --> 00:39:37,078
So we hope to, so hopefully you see this stuff come to fruition.

435
00:39:37,499 --> 00:39:45,025
And it's frustrating for us too, because sometimes it's piecemeal, but eventually it's all going to connect and it's going to be better for all users.

436
00:39:45,045 --> 00:39:49,168
So we, you know, we do the best we can with our limited resources and we hope to continue to do so.

437
00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:52,911
And Bobby has a question.

438
00:39:52,931 --> 00:39:59,116
Hi, my name is Bobby Dellafano.

439
00:39:59,156 --> 00:40:00,257
I reside at 46 Hume Ave.

440
00:40:03,994 --> 00:40:05,534
I'd just like to say a couple of things.

441
00:40:05,974 --> 00:40:14,936
I've been at this residence for 48 years and it's a great neighborhood.

442
00:40:15,456 --> 00:40:16,817
We haven't had any issues.

443
00:40:16,877 --> 00:40:21,578
The green line come in, it's a plus, it's wonderful.

444
00:40:21,638 --> 00:40:29,340
The neighbors all signed petitions to put in permit parking, which in my opinion has worked out fantastic.

445
00:40:30,829 --> 00:40:38,311
What I haven't seen anybody talk about yet this evening is, what about the winter?

446
00:40:39,391 --> 00:40:40,111
Heavy snow.

447
00:40:40,351 --> 00:40:41,232
What about the rain?

448
00:40:41,592 --> 00:40:44,832
Heavy rains, extreme cold, extreme heat.

449
00:40:45,813 --> 00:40:54,895
You're gonna have people that live somewhere over near Bob's Food Store at the end of Vasa Street or that area there.

450
00:40:55,748 --> 00:41:01,133
They're going to be coming down to Hume, Bridget, to Park, to get on the Green Line.

451
00:41:01,993 --> 00:41:22,771
Now we're going to get a blizzard that day, or snow that day, and there might not be a traffic, there might not be a snow emergency posted or whatever, but it's not fair to the residents that are going to have a car parked in front of the house and the streets not going to get plowed because there's somebody from

452
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:30,161
just on the outside of the blue zone, parking there, extreme cold.

453
00:41:30,541 --> 00:41:38,725
So a lot of people that don't want to walk 10, 15 minutes to get to the green line, they're going to park on Brigid Ave or Hume Ave.

454
00:41:40,025 --> 00:41:44,447
When it's pouring rain out, it's going to be the same thing, the cold rain, extreme heat.

455
00:41:44,467 --> 00:41:45,807
I mean, it's just, to me,

456
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:52,823
Why are we trying to even, what are we trying to accomplish with zone parking?

457
00:41:53,183 --> 00:41:57,366
The street by street parking is working perfectly fine the way it is.

458
00:41:57,386 --> 00:42:00,829
I mean, why are we trying to reinvent the wheel here?

459
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:12,973
Myself personally, I look at this map and I'm trying to figure out what this quarter mile radius is around the T station.

460
00:42:12,993 --> 00:42:14,254
Does it have any meaning?

461
00:42:16,614 --> 00:42:25,237
It's in the blue zone, but anybody in the blue zone can park anywhere in this quarter mile radius, which is where my house is.

462
00:42:26,807 --> 00:42:31,369
And those are just the concerns that I have all due respect.

463
00:42:31,889 --> 00:42:38,892
And I just wanted to express that and I really appreciating you folks letting me talk.

464
00:42:38,952 --> 00:42:46,256
I know we had some issues here with some people that are trying to.

465
00:42:46,696 --> 00:42:50,818
But again, thank you for letting me express my opinion.

466
00:42:51,698 --> 00:42:53,460
Thank you, Steve.

467
00:42:54,161 --> 00:42:58,286
Is it possible to bring up the slide of the map so we can just talk about it?

468
00:42:58,807 --> 00:43:01,890
So, those are great questions and valid questions.

469
00:43:02,231 --> 00:43:07,897
So, the math originated from being within walking short walking distance of the transit zones, right?

470
00:43:09,219 --> 00:43:11,261
And so the shape of it.

471
00:43:12,856 --> 00:43:16,519
The quarter mile is a rough quarter mile, which is a very reasonable short walk.

472
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:30,813
Now, in some cases, it looks like it's further, but because it didn't make sense to have a zone which excluded, say, a street or two that are just outside a quarter mile, or to have a street where half the street was zoned and half of it wasn't.

473
00:43:31,313 --> 00:43:50,652
like if half of stanley ave was in zone half wasn't it didn't make much sense you know once a street was in it made sense to capture that entire street so this seems like the most logical area that captures areas that are located within or close proximity to the three transit stations the tufts

474
00:43:51,558 --> 00:44:00,883
the Tufts-Medford station, the South Medford slash Ball Square station, and then the Magoon slash Lowell station in Somerville, which is why the Bow Street area is included.

475
00:44:01,443 --> 00:44:09,167
So if you look off of those green symbols, it's roughly the same distance away to the Northeast and to the West.

476
00:44:09,747 --> 00:44:10,928
So again, you know,

477
00:44:12,248 --> 00:44:21,694
it didn't seem to make much sense if you did a zone that stopped short of Yale and then stopped short of Princeton on the other side and just left a gap of one street in the middle.

478
00:44:21,974 --> 00:44:29,639
So it's just trying to make a sensible, cohesive area that makes somewhat sense with the short distance.

479
00:44:29,659 --> 00:44:32,701
And again, no area within this

480
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:36,502
proposed zone is further than about 3,000 feet.

481
00:44:36,522 --> 00:44:37,864
That's the furthest.

482
00:44:38,364 --> 00:44:39,825
And that's about a 12-minute walk.

483
00:44:40,446 --> 00:44:50,735
So to get in your car, to move it from the space you already have, and take those few minutes to then search a street, like two streets over, to find one parallel park.

484
00:44:51,315 --> 00:45:13,635
and then is it really worth it that you know that that short amount of distance it doesn't seem like in this zone it's worth it to do it now if someone was talking about someone across the city but they wouldn't be allowed to park in this zone so if the zone is bigger we could see those concerns but the smaller zone it is we don't necessarily see that coming to fruition so um but thank you that was very helpful comments

485
00:45:20,517 --> 00:45:26,142
Okay, let me check the chat to see if there's any other questions.

486
00:45:31,726 --> 00:45:34,909
Steve, I see a question about the T employees on Boston Avenue.

487
00:45:35,490 --> 00:45:41,655
We are aware of that issue and we're working with MBTA on resolving or improving that situation.

488
00:45:43,896 --> 00:45:47,960
That was a comment about MBTA employees, I think, parking near the train station.

489
00:45:50,733 --> 00:45:54,175
Okay, I think Rob wants to know what success looks like.

490
00:45:54,355 --> 00:45:55,275
What does failure look like?

491
00:45:55,315 --> 00:45:56,595
How long is the trial period?

492
00:45:57,296 --> 00:46:02,258
Can it be reversed if there's a big influx on parking issues on individual streets?

493
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:12,501
So because of the pilot nature of the proposal, things will be re-evaluated.

494
00:46:12,741 --> 00:46:18,604
People could continue to provide comments throughout the year, and it would be revisited at a future traffic commission meeting.

495
00:46:20,487 --> 00:46:27,514
So success would be, you know, realizing all the benefits without all the potential concerns that are coming up, right?

496
00:46:27,554 --> 00:46:28,415
That would be success.

497
00:46:28,755 --> 00:46:33,640
So success would be, you know, you have a program, it's working, it's not a...

498
00:46:34,404 --> 00:46:59,530
overwhelming influx of new permits does not overwhelm the influx of one street going to another street it actually those few occasions when when you experience um you know some issues and you find that oh this is great that now i can park on the next street over into this no big deal no fear of getting a ticket um you know that would be a success um you know yeah i don't know if jim had anything to add to that but um

499
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:04,761
But this truly is a proposal to help residents.

500
00:47:05,962 --> 00:47:10,263
I guess it seems like it's not to some, which is, you know, you have the right to your opinion.

501
00:47:10,603 --> 00:47:13,984
But again, Medford's not the first to ever try this type of thing.

502
00:47:14,545 --> 00:47:21,447
As mentioned in the slides, in the timeline, there's a consultant who looks at permanent parking programs throughout.

503
00:47:22,067 --> 00:47:23,327
the state throughout the country.

504
00:47:23,847 --> 00:47:26,688
These are not unusual, unheard of ideas.

505
00:47:27,288 --> 00:47:28,788
So it's just new to Medford.

506
00:47:28,828 --> 00:47:31,089
That's why it's a pilot and that's why it's such a small area.

507
00:47:31,409 --> 00:47:33,389
And some people think, well, why this area?

508
00:47:33,709 --> 00:47:37,370
Because it's the more dense area of Medford, closest to transit.

509
00:47:37,590 --> 00:47:43,291
So those are usually scenarios where parking is at more of a premium, right?

510
00:47:43,691 --> 00:47:48,292
So we wanna do our best to limit it to the residents that live in that area.

511
00:48:02,002 --> 00:48:03,403
Anyone else have any other questions?

512
00:48:09,468 --> 00:48:11,170
Do we get to most of them in the chat here?

513
00:48:11,190 --> 00:48:14,833
We covered a lot of this stuff about stickers.

514
00:48:14,853 --> 00:48:21,258
I don't know if you want to reiterate that, Ty or Jim, just, you know, how we, why we don't use stickers for permits.

515
00:48:24,826 --> 00:48:26,887
I mean, that is feedback we heard loud and clear.

516
00:48:27,867 --> 00:48:37,789
As we said, we're constantly reviewing our policies and considering ways to better support the community, whether it's for their benefit or enforcement benefit or not.

517
00:48:38,210 --> 00:48:50,653
So this newer technology seemed to be working well, but that's feedback we've heard loud and clear, and we'll take that back and consider whatever folks may be providing feedback.

518
00:49:05,269 --> 00:49:07,932
Just a lot of comments in the chat to.

519
00:49:12,818 --> 00:49:17,182
So, again, there's a traffic commission meeting on April 9th.

520
00:49:17,923 --> 00:49:22,428
Tuesday, April 9th at 5 0T PM where this will be voted on so you can definitely also attend that and.

521
00:49:24,412 --> 00:49:28,634
invoice your opinion or suggestions to the Traffic Commission before they vote.

522
00:49:28,654 --> 00:49:31,715
I just want to make sure we get everyone's question.

523
00:49:31,735 --> 00:49:36,897
I know, I'm sorry, it's been a little chaotic here, but we're trying to answer as many questions as we possibly can.

524
00:49:36,917 --> 00:49:50,823
From Nora, if we suspect that a car not from the zone is parked in front of my house, who do we contact to get some enforcement?

525
00:49:54,279 --> 00:50:00,445
Again, I want to emphasize that the enforcement folks will be enforcing as they normally do.

526
00:50:00,805 --> 00:50:09,193
If the car appears to be outside of the zone with the license plate scanner, they'll be ticketed.

527
00:50:19,990 --> 00:50:28,214
Steve, I think I could touch on a couple of things because some other folks are asking for, you know, bike lanes and things like that.

528
00:50:28,294 --> 00:50:32,016
So just, you know, this is a meeting about a zone parking program.

529
00:50:32,056 --> 00:50:33,836
That's why we're talking about parking a lot.

530
00:50:34,336 --> 00:50:34,957
But, you know,

531
00:50:35,677 --> 00:50:41,580
A majority of my time is trying to make things safer and make things more mobile and accessible for all users.

532
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:46,522
So other things we do are things like review private developments in your area.

533
00:50:46,722 --> 00:50:53,525
And we ask for bike racks and EV parking and contributions to mitigation to help traffic calming and things like that.

534
00:50:53,885 --> 00:50:55,626
So we're constantly doing other things like that.

535
00:50:55,666 --> 00:50:57,467
So it's not that we're not doing it.

536
00:50:57,607 --> 00:51:00,268
It's just not necessarily the focus of this particular meeting.

537
00:51:00,788 --> 00:51:02,829
So we do appreciate the support.

538
00:51:05,323 --> 00:51:09,926
you know, for advocacy for increased safety and increased access to other modes of travel.

539
00:51:10,506 --> 00:51:16,830
So we're constantly doing that, requiring bike parking and other things in private developments and things like that.

540
00:51:16,870 --> 00:51:25,355
So we're trying to add as many bicycle and pedestrian improvements and safety as we can and encourage other modes as best we can.

541
00:51:25,375 --> 00:51:31,639
We're fighting to keep as many bus lines as we can, more frequent service, and we're doing all we can on those fronts.

542
00:51:31,679 --> 00:51:33,841
So we also agree that

543
00:51:34,681 --> 00:51:44,710
If new residents that come into Medford, if they use those modes and they see the availability, then maybe they won't have a car that contributes to these issues.

544
00:51:44,890 --> 00:51:47,332
We do understand that and get that and appreciate the support for that.

545
00:51:51,401 --> 00:51:55,105
Okay, any other last questions here before we wrap up.

546
00:51:56,747 --> 00:52:10,181
Again, this presentation will be online I think it'll be edited slightly, and then we'll be online, as well as the meeting will be online as well as the presentation, and then again the traffic commission meeting is on April 9.

547
00:52:12,230 --> 00:52:17,353
And if you have any other additional questions, please feel free to email Jim or Todd or myself.

548
00:52:17,793 --> 00:52:21,255
I'll put our emails in the chat just for reference.

549
00:52:22,416 --> 00:52:23,176
I think that's it, everyone.

550
00:52:23,196 --> 00:52:24,056
Thanks so much for coming.

551
00:52:24,117 --> 00:52:26,258
And again, I apologize for the disruptions.

552
00:52:27,098 --> 00:52:31,641
Obviously, it was uncalled for, but we got through it and hope we were able to answer most of your questions.

553
00:52:31,681 --> 00:52:35,663
And again, if not, please feel free to reach out to us and we'll get you the answers you need.

554
00:52:36,063 --> 00:52:36,763
Thanks so much, everybody.

555
00:52:36,783 --> 00:52:37,764
Have a good night.

556
00:52:38,624 --> 00:52:39,025
Thank you.

557
00:52:39,545 --> 00:52:39,805
Thank you.
