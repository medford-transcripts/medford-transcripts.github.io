1
00:00:00,614 --> 00:00:01,574
All right, how you doing, everybody?

2
00:00:01,594 --> 00:00:06,116
So we'll give kind of a light agenda tonight.

3
00:00:07,476 --> 00:00:18,500
So last month, we had a walk of the South Street to look at potential locations for street signage.

4
00:00:21,281 --> 00:00:22,902
We identified three spots.

5
00:00:24,022 --> 00:00:26,923
So two of those spots would be signs like

6
00:00:28,735 --> 00:00:29,595
This picture?

7
00:00:29,816 --> 00:00:30,936
Yeah, I can share the screen.

8
00:00:31,016 --> 00:00:31,576
Okay, perfect.

9
00:00:31,596 --> 00:00:32,057
Thank you.

10
00:00:32,077 --> 00:00:33,017
Yeah, of course.

11
00:00:33,717 --> 00:00:34,538
I try to be prepared.

12
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:35,738
No, it's excellent.

13
00:00:35,758 --> 00:00:37,119
You're very well prepared.

14
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:39,040
All right.

15
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:47,944
So everybody should be seeing a horrible rendering of South Street, of the signage here.

16
00:00:48,124 --> 00:00:49,265
I'm saying James Nodding.

17
00:00:49,325 --> 00:00:49,625
Thank you.

18
00:00:51,586 --> 00:01:11,037
So this would be one of the potential signages that we could do, and it would be a descriptive signage where it would be a sign that describes what the South Street District is, and it's like a grassy area right off of the river there.

19
00:01:11,577 --> 00:01:13,178
That would be an excellent spot for it.

20
00:01:14,321 --> 00:01:20,864
There's been talk of at some point being a larger project and making a walking path there or whatever.

21
00:01:21,704 --> 00:01:29,068
That signage could potentially be incorporated into a sitting area to look out at the river as you're walking or whatever.

22
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,308
That would be nice.

23
00:01:31,209 --> 00:01:32,529
That one might hold off.

24
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:37,752
I personally would love to do that one first, but that's going to be

25
00:01:39,255 --> 00:01:43,838
A large budget item and a little bit of more logistics.

26
00:01:43,878 --> 00:01:49,101
Yeah, it's it's operation because we don't have control of the waterfront.

27
00:01:49,382 --> 00:01:51,943
It's got a zillion hurdles to it.

28
00:01:52,143 --> 00:01:52,884
Yeah.

29
00:01:53,945 --> 00:01:55,085
It's awesome though.

30
00:01:55,345 --> 00:01:58,407
I just love looking at that.

31
00:01:59,008 --> 00:02:01,169
But anyways, but to actually get something done,

32
00:02:03,335 --> 00:02:32,675
we located two spots uh to put signage on either end of um of south street like you know where the houses start and end or end and start depending upon well i guess it's a one way so it is starting to end yeah um and uh one there one's using uh a pre-existing like sign oh so it'll be a new sign post but it's an existing location of a sign so it doesn't like

33
00:02:34,103 --> 00:03:02,273
uh clutter up the street with more like signposts and signs just kind of just changing what the signage would be um and then the other one down the other way we're gonna we're just gonna go on the street with that or what was the end thought yeah we we're probably just going to be able to go on the street with alan this is at the corner of curtis and south street which is effectively the the first house um that is in the district is right at the corner of that um

34
00:03:04,259 --> 00:03:09,901
Ideally, looking at the space there, it would be great if we could go on to the grass area.

35
00:03:10,001 --> 00:03:11,862
However, that is not our property.

36
00:03:13,102 --> 00:03:25,846
So I think that there would be a bit of, either we cannot do it there or approaching that homeowner and saying, hey, would you be willing for us to put a very decorative, very prissy signpost on your property?

37
00:03:25,906 --> 00:03:27,727
Just be barely on your property.

38
00:03:28,367 --> 00:03:31,408
Because that particular, actually I think,

39
00:03:32,742 --> 00:03:38,026
Everybody should still be seeing a Google map at this point, or are we still seeing the street signs?

40
00:03:38,806 --> 00:03:41,088
Still seeing the street signs.

41
00:03:41,148 --> 00:03:41,968
It's the first one.

42
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:46,772
Yeah, I thought I wasn't sure if I shared just the application.

43
00:03:47,412 --> 00:03:49,013
So it's this location here.

44
00:03:49,173 --> 00:03:55,017
So this house with the green shutters and the tree in the front, that is in the district.

45
00:03:55,237 --> 00:04:01,702
So right here on the corner of that sidewalk would be an ideal location just because that is

46
00:04:02,385 --> 00:04:06,447
the anchor, the first house coming down the street.

47
00:04:06,467 --> 00:04:08,968
I don't think we'd have enough room on the sidewalk here.

48
00:04:08,988 --> 00:04:11,790
You can see the sidewalk's also not in great shape.

49
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:20,054
But something to explore with DPW, maybe we could do a bit of an enhancement of the sidewalk.

50
00:04:20,534 --> 00:04:25,797
So to fix the issues here while also having a place for signage is a small possibility.

51
00:04:28,069 --> 00:04:33,775
So the plan, the plan, and Teresa's done a real tremendous job on this.

52
00:04:35,698 --> 00:04:45,609
So what the plan is, is that we're going to, she's approached the carpentry teacher at Medford High Folk and

53
00:04:47,182 --> 00:05:00,475
He seems to be receptive of making the sign and then the deep we would purchase that like we like the historic district commission would purchase the sign post.

54
00:05:00,695 --> 00:05:03,358
Yeah, well, they post the material has to get purchased by.

55
00:05:03,778 --> 00:05:09,301
through this budget, then they would do the work to it, however they're going to make the sign.

56
00:05:09,841 --> 00:05:17,024
And then we would purchase a signed post, and then the DPW would install that, which is great.

57
00:05:17,304 --> 00:05:17,505
Yeah.

58
00:05:18,705 --> 00:05:30,451
And when I approached the vocational school, I feel like City Hall, we have a great resource there, but I wanted to not just say, hey, can you make something for me and call it a day?

59
00:05:30,471 --> 00:05:33,032
I think this would be a really great collaboration

60
00:05:33,642 --> 00:05:38,525
with the high school, you know, I asked him, like, it's a loose bag.

61
00:05:38,685 --> 00:05:50,751
So I said, Mr. Spagnola, do you have anybody in your class you think would be really interested in history and maybe, you know, be more involved in, like, the content creation of this, just to see if there's some collaboration there.

62
00:05:50,811 --> 00:05:52,812
He seemed really excited about that idea.

63
00:05:52,932 --> 00:06:02,197
So, you know, not just, hey, kids, make this, you know, it's, you know, be involved with it, understand what we're making, understand the content, the importance of it.

64
00:06:02,802 --> 00:06:03,523
and also make it.

65
00:06:05,685 --> 00:06:11,289
So yeah, some really exciting opportunities there.

66
00:06:11,309 --> 00:06:11,830
Yeah.

67
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:20,798
And I feel very comfortable that they'd be able to make these signs for us, the more laid signs, very easily.

68
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:23,840
This one will be a little bit more involved, the interpretive sign.

69
00:06:24,221 --> 00:06:28,164
That's the officially inferred informative sign, it's called an interpretive sign.

70
00:06:31,284 --> 00:06:35,007
Yeah, and initial thoughts, Pasita, James?

71
00:06:35,247 --> 00:06:36,188
Yeah.

72
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:45,194
In terms of the interpretive sign, do we know, it was mentioned that maybe there'd be a bigger project along that part of the river.

73
00:06:45,954 --> 00:06:47,456
Is there any timeline for that?

74
00:06:47,496 --> 00:06:50,137
Do we know if that's going to happen in the next five years?

75
00:06:50,157 --> 00:06:58,443
I think if we start the conversations now, I mean, it'll end up, we can't just put a sign here.

76
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,505
We'd have to put in some sidewalk, which

77
00:07:01,222 --> 00:07:07,947
As we were walking, we saw that the ground had been worn down for people walking on this grass area.

78
00:07:08,007 --> 00:07:10,989
So it's indicative that there should be a sidewalk here, too.

79
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:14,191
So it's a little bit more involved in the project.

80
00:07:14,311 --> 00:07:25,119
I would say if I could call Mr. DCR right now and say, can I please do this, it would probably be a two-year project, two to three years.

81
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:31,751
just to improve that area.

82
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:41,819
For us, just to make a sign and put it in somewhere else on South Street that we have jurisdiction of, that would be faster, so we don't have to go through approvals and whatnot.

83
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:45,663
But this just seems like a great opportunity in this spot.

84
00:07:45,703 --> 00:07:48,925
When you see that spot, it's a great spot.

85
00:07:49,085 --> 00:07:49,406
Yeah.

86
00:07:50,487 --> 00:07:51,427
It really is nice.

87
00:07:52,769 --> 00:07:55,531
I'm curious, and again, I agree with you.

88
00:07:55,591 --> 00:07:56,692
I think that'd be great.

89
00:07:57,152 --> 00:07:57,713
I'm curious if

90
00:07:59,725 --> 00:08:08,268
waiting until a larger improvement project is done might be more prudent, just in terms of the cost of it.

91
00:08:08,288 --> 00:08:15,090
Because we could put a sign there, and then they could come along a year from now and say, oh, yeah, we're going to tear this all up and put something.

92
00:08:15,711 --> 00:08:16,031
Yeah.

93
00:08:16,311 --> 00:08:19,772
Do we lose the sign, or does it have to get pulled up and that kind of thing?

94
00:08:19,812 --> 00:08:21,733
So I don't know if that matters.

95
00:08:21,913 --> 00:08:27,735
If it's something where, you know what, we could do this, and probably we won't say anything for another 10 years, great.

96
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:30,060
Yeah.

97
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:35,923
You know, and like you said, people already use it probably to walk their dogs and jog and all that kind of stuff.

98
00:08:36,243 --> 00:08:42,205
And honestly, if I was walking along the river there, I would likely use that side of the river also, because again, just.

99
00:08:43,766 --> 00:08:49,908
It'd be a lot easier on my on my legs and back walking on ground and pavement for three miles or something.

100
00:08:49,948 --> 00:08:58,692
So this is just a natural, you know, people naturally want to walk closest to the prettiest thing, which is the river.

101
00:08:58,812 --> 00:08:58,952
So

102
00:09:01,348 --> 00:09:01,708
Yeah.

103
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:05,771
Okay, so it sounds like we're on the right path here.

104
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:09,694
So I'll piggybacking on James's comment.

105
00:09:09,754 --> 00:09:12,076
Sorry, sorry, Theresa.

106
00:09:12,376 --> 00:09:19,621
Can we look for putting a temp sign on temporary signage, which can be moved?

107
00:09:19,981 --> 00:09:23,664
Like, can we put a temporary sign on the residence side?

108
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:30,798
like the property, residence property that you just showed, can we request them for a temporary sign for now?

109
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:34,559
And then when this project is done, we can actually move it to a permanent location.

110
00:09:34,579 --> 00:09:37,599
I think that's certainly an option.

111
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:50,601
I just think if we were to put in this interpretive sign, as you're seeing now, where it's something that people have to walk up to, the city is just in an obligation to make it accessible to get to that site.

112
00:09:50,781 --> 00:09:51,942
Oh, yeah.

113
00:09:52,082 --> 00:09:54,242
But I think a temporary sign, though, might

114
00:09:56,202 --> 00:10:00,143
Skirt that a little bit because, you know, nobody's saying it's going to be here forever.

115
00:10:00,223 --> 00:10:01,763
It's just, you know, temporary thing.

116
00:10:02,563 --> 00:10:05,224
I think that's a great idea to explore that.

117
00:10:05,244 --> 00:10:07,224
That's a great idea.

118
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:07,724
Yeah.

119
00:10:10,385 --> 00:10:20,387
Write it down and that's something I think we could also churn out faster than, you know, this design framed thing, you know, make.

120
00:10:22,468 --> 00:10:26,029
Well, how about I bring that to Mr. Spagnola at the high school?

121
00:10:26,269 --> 00:10:27,130
Absolutely.

122
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:28,790
And we can go from there.

123
00:10:30,191 --> 00:10:31,111
What were you envisioning?

124
00:10:31,191 --> 00:10:34,752
If I may ask Basita, what were you kind of picturing?

125
00:10:35,352 --> 00:10:40,314
Like an A-frame sign, like a sandwich board sign, or just something that is still stuck in the ground, just not...

126
00:10:40,993 --> 00:10:41,994
as a labyrinth?

127
00:10:42,894 --> 00:10:51,160
Yeah, I think something that's still stuck in the ground, but we don't want to potentially damage the ground if we're using the residence property.

128
00:10:52,661 --> 00:10:57,665
Anything that goes into the ground definitely needs a little bit of foundation, concrete, and everything on it.

129
00:10:57,785 --> 00:11:10,514
So minimal damage, but still the sign can be there for maybe two years if we're expecting the DCR to put a walkway for two years.

130
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,281
And it can be replaced.

131
00:11:12,481 --> 00:11:15,643
And it doesn't need to be elaborate, huge sign.

132
00:11:15,703 --> 00:11:21,408
It can just say that, you know, you're welcome to historic district, just maybe a two by two, small one.

133
00:11:21,428 --> 00:11:22,409
Yeah.

134
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:35,238
I think we're in a position where we could move quicker on the blade signs that just say South Street Historic District, like what's on the screen.

135
00:11:39,087 --> 00:11:44,031
I could probably even just order them online and have them in a week and then go to DPW, you know.

136
00:11:46,032 --> 00:11:51,736
So... I'm speaking aloud a bit there.

137
00:11:51,996 --> 00:11:57,000
Why don't I bring that idea to Mr. Spagnuolo and, you know, he's a graphic designer.

138
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,501
He might have some more thoughts.

139
00:11:58,821 --> 00:12:00,562
I'm not a designer.

140
00:12:00,702 --> 00:12:04,505
I have thoughts and I can, I think, cobble things together, but, you know,

141
00:12:05,358 --> 00:12:08,861
And again, I think it would be fun to see what the class comes up with.

142
00:12:08,901 --> 00:12:09,521
Yeah, that's true.

143
00:12:09,621 --> 00:12:10,202
Yeah.

144
00:12:10,242 --> 00:12:10,502
Yeah.

145
00:12:11,142 --> 00:12:11,382
Yeah.

146
00:12:11,603 --> 00:12:16,887
Not trying to voice the responsibility onto the kids, but trying to get them involved in it.

147
00:12:17,127 --> 00:12:19,368
I'll tell you, if they really do that, that would be excellent.

148
00:12:19,869 --> 00:12:20,109
Yeah.

149
00:12:20,209 --> 00:12:26,033
And they'll be excited, too, to have their design something in the city.

150
00:12:26,053 --> 00:12:29,236
They'll walk through it and then be like, oh, wow, this is something I did.

151
00:12:29,256 --> 00:12:29,476
Right.

152
00:12:31,512 --> 00:12:37,296
community fridge that's here in Medford Square, the vocational school built the shed that's around it.

153
00:12:37,436 --> 00:12:39,858
And, you know, they're so proud of it.

154
00:12:40,239 --> 00:12:40,839
That's awesome.

155
00:12:40,999 --> 00:12:44,342
You know, have a little impact on the community.

156
00:12:44,362 --> 00:12:46,123
All right.

157
00:12:46,143 --> 00:12:46,403
Awesome.

158
00:12:47,384 --> 00:12:48,185
All right.

159
00:12:48,325 --> 00:12:54,069
And in terms of the locations, it sounds like where we like make sense where they are.

160
00:12:54,089 --> 00:12:56,090
Is everyone okay with the locations?

161
00:12:56,471 --> 00:12:57,411
Okay, great.

162
00:12:58,112 --> 00:12:58,672
Fantastic.

163
00:12:58,692 --> 00:13:00,754
I don't know if we need to necessarily vote on it.

164
00:13:01,772 --> 00:13:27,860
um we don't need to then yeah because i mean this is still subject to dpw they may come back to me and say like oh no you can't do that teresa you know um yeah and on the on the sign post what are we gonna it is that something that can just be purchased are we just gonna go right onto that sign post um i think it would look a little i like keeping the um

165
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:54,633
yes my personal opinion you know that you're the committee here um let's just use something a little bit nicer okay yeah yeah other districts it doesn't happen yeah i don't want to go over anything over something that looks like power strut yeah so uh yeah cool all right so i will proceed thank you very much for your thank you your thoughts on that one

166
00:13:57,308 --> 00:14:01,570
I know next on the agenda is to review a drafted informative mailer.

167
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:17,136
I did not get a chance to finalize the mailer, but this is something that the board has talked about in the past just to help bring more awareness to either new homeowners or existing homeowners in our districts just to make them aware.

168
00:14:19,017 --> 00:14:19,957
What I can

169
00:14:21,028 --> 00:14:27,233
show and I'd love to get folks's feedback maybe and that would give me a little bit of a point me in a direction.

170
00:14:28,214 --> 00:14:32,257
If I may share a couple of examples of what other communities do.

171
00:14:32,277 --> 00:14:36,420
I'm going to share my screen again.

172
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:39,062
Sorry, it keeps like, I keep bouncing around.

173
00:14:56,097 --> 00:15:01,658
All right, so folks should be seeing, I know it kind of looks funky, but it is a trifold.

174
00:15:01,678 --> 00:15:09,499
So if you can envision it folded, where it says preserve one of the most important assets in your neighborhood, that would be the front page.

175
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,920
And then this orange section here is the back side.

176
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:21,921
This is from Milwaukee, but I think this is really a great example of what can be done.

177
00:15:21,941 --> 00:15:25,022
At least the content, it still applies.

178
00:15:25,938 --> 00:15:26,899
to here in New England.

179
00:15:30,382 --> 00:15:39,491
So it just kind of has some overview of what type of work needs to come before the board for review, certificate of appropriateness.

180
00:15:40,593 --> 00:15:45,457
I think this is actually a really big one to the financial assistance.

181
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:48,921
We have a lot of folks in Medford who are

182
00:15:50,184 --> 00:15:58,527
I don't want to say house rich, cash poor, but a lot of low and moderate income homeowners happen to also be homeowners of historic buildings.

183
00:15:59,248 --> 00:16:11,513
So in my other role in City Hall, I get a lot of inquiries from folks saying, hi, I live on a fixed income, but I need a new roof, or I need a new window, and I live in a historic home.

184
00:16:12,253 --> 00:16:15,354
Are there any grant programs out there for me?

185
00:16:15,794 --> 00:16:16,815
And the answer is yes.

186
00:16:18,257 --> 00:16:22,239
super robust, but you know, there's historical tax credits that are out there.

187
00:16:22,319 --> 00:16:26,521
There are a couple of grant programs that will help, you know, fund smaller projects.

188
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:30,103
So I think it's, I'd love to really see people taking advantage of that.

189
00:16:30,163 --> 00:16:30,744
Yeah.

190
00:16:31,144 --> 00:16:34,425
And maybe they just don't know, you know, people don't know.

191
00:16:34,826 --> 00:16:35,086
Right.

192
00:16:35,126 --> 00:16:45,551
So I, you know, this is again, centric to Wisconsin, but, um, but we can tweak it obviously for Medford, uh, for Massachusetts.

193
00:16:46,612 --> 00:16:46,672
Um,

194
00:16:48,352 --> 00:17:06,824
So I think it's, I love this example just because it's eye-catching, it's informative, you know, it's something that they won't just throw away, you know, if it's a postcard or an envelope stuffed with a letter, they might just, you know, but this is something they might tuck away.

195
00:17:06,844 --> 00:17:09,646
Any initial thoughts?

196
00:17:11,672 --> 00:17:21,019
I would make sure that it has the city seal on it, because otherwise this would end up in the barrel of my house.

197
00:17:21,059 --> 00:17:23,321
I would not even spend two seconds looking at it.

198
00:17:24,141 --> 00:17:29,065
Interesting, so you think because it just might blend in with other marketing materials?

199
00:17:29,105 --> 00:17:32,968
Yeah, it looks like a marketing material to me, like they're trying to buy my house or something.

200
00:17:38,393 --> 00:17:43,918
It does a little bit give the marketing fields, but we are trying to give them helpful information.

201
00:17:44,879 --> 00:17:50,785
I've also noticed that a few like goodies, something like that.

202
00:17:51,045 --> 00:17:58,633
I recently got a realtor's card as a refrigerator magnet, and it had all his information on it.

203
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,720
It's something you put on.

204
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,441
You might use it.

205
00:18:02,601 --> 00:18:11,942
So can we add something like that that can be in front of them when they are cooking or just looking somewhere?

206
00:18:13,182 --> 00:18:15,343
It can catch their eye now and then.

207
00:18:15,363 --> 00:18:15,443
Yeah.

208
00:18:19,403 --> 00:18:22,784
I think we have so few homes that this could be something.

209
00:18:22,864 --> 00:18:24,064
I keep calling it a mailer.

210
00:18:24,084 --> 00:18:26,845
It could be something that I'd be willing to go and hand deliver.

211
00:18:27,085 --> 00:18:28,285
It would take an afternoon.

212
00:18:28,722 --> 00:18:32,963
But maybe we could print up like a magnet that goes on the fridge.

213
00:18:33,983 --> 00:18:39,345
So I could hand out the mailer with like a little goodie thing, you know, clip to it to see that it worked.

214
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:40,145
Yeah.

215
00:18:40,165 --> 00:18:50,248
So it's just like, you know, this is, it just says that your home is a historic, your home is a historic home.

216
00:18:50,308 --> 00:18:55,649
So, and then you just have a QR code that says, you know, when you scan the QR code, you just,

217
00:18:56,437 --> 00:18:58,338
get all this information that's on the mailer.

218
00:18:59,318 --> 00:18:59,638
Yeah.

219
00:19:00,299 --> 00:19:01,499
And it's always on their fridge.

220
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:11,304
So whenever you think of something, you just scan the QR code on your fridge and then you're, even if you lose the mailer, you just still have this information handy on your phone.

221
00:19:12,224 --> 00:19:13,205
I love that idea.

222
00:19:13,225 --> 00:19:18,167
Um, you know, and have it be like a fun thing, not just, yeah.

223
00:19:18,787 --> 00:19:20,888
Um, I like that idea.

224
00:19:20,968 --> 00:19:23,029
And, and Magna is cheap money.

225
00:19:23,049 --> 00:19:25,110
You know, I could probably get a hundred of them for,

226
00:19:25,887 --> 00:19:28,109
less than 100 bucks, you know.

227
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:30,711
Not that I'm spending your budget or anything.

228
00:19:31,271 --> 00:19:32,673
It's there for a reason.

229
00:19:32,693 --> 00:19:33,553
No, that's a great idea.

230
00:19:33,613 --> 00:19:34,174
Yeah.

231
00:19:35,655 --> 00:19:36,355
What do you think, James?

232
00:19:37,116 --> 00:19:45,283
I was going to say, the other thing I would do, just as you've kind of flipped through the different pages, and I don't know when they produced this.

233
00:19:45,303 --> 00:19:46,584
I think it looks terrific.

234
00:19:47,705 --> 00:19:55,351
I would almost say that the contact information, whether it's the hotline, a website, whatever it is,

235
00:19:55,803 --> 00:19:57,584
I'd put that a little more front and center.

236
00:19:58,904 --> 00:19:59,245
Yeah.

237
00:20:01,065 --> 00:20:06,388
Because as I'm reading through it, like on this one all the way at the bottom on the left hand side, it seems like it has phone numbers.

238
00:20:06,828 --> 00:20:10,369
And then I think we're on the second or third page before you actually see a website.

239
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:21,714
And all of this could also be on the website with additional links and things like that to other local and state resources and stuff like that.

240
00:20:22,475 --> 00:20:22,715
Yeah.

241
00:20:25,222 --> 00:20:31,247
I'd like to see on a two with some, if we could tuck it in somewhere that, you know, we'd love their participation on the board.

242
00:20:31,788 --> 00:20:32,068
Yeah.

243
00:20:32,368 --> 00:20:35,771
We're always looking for new members or come join us every where we meet them.

244
00:20:35,811 --> 00:20:36,112
Yeah.

245
00:20:36,172 --> 00:20:36,372
Yeah.

246
00:20:36,752 --> 00:20:36,932
Yep.

247
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:42,057
All right.

248
00:20:42,357 --> 00:20:43,718
I do have another option.

249
00:20:43,778 --> 00:20:45,340
It's a, it's a little bit more.

250
00:20:48,668 --> 00:20:51,109
just a letter that would get stuffed into an envelope.

251
00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:54,750
And I think this one comes from... That one's easy on the eyes.

252
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:57,331
It's nice reading something like that.

253
00:20:57,531 --> 00:20:57,971
Yeah.

254
00:20:59,511 --> 00:21:02,712
Let me just do a quick share of the other one, just so you can see.

255
00:21:02,732 --> 00:21:10,255
This is an example coming from our friends in Norwell.

256
00:21:10,755 --> 00:21:11,355
Beautiful.

257
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:12,776
They mailed it, yeah.

258
00:21:13,256 --> 00:21:14,176
They mailed this out.

259
00:21:15,642 --> 00:21:21,430
Every February so folks will see the same letter coming through them, you know, year over year, but.

260
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:26,717
It's a little bit just more high level informative.

261
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:31,644
If we go this route, we definitely have to have the magnet.

262
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,582
Yeah, because this isn't one you hold on to.

263
00:21:35,622 --> 00:21:38,063
If you held on to this, you forgot where you put it after.

264
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:43,246
Yeah, I think it's good content, but it isn't eye-catching.

265
00:21:44,207 --> 00:21:48,709
I think a lot of this content could probably be something that could be put on the website.

266
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:51,030
Yes, absolutely.

267
00:21:51,511 --> 00:21:52,771
And with the tri-fold,

268
00:21:54,542 --> 00:21:55,762
That's the pizzazz.

269
00:21:55,842 --> 00:21:57,583
That's the thing that gets somebody excited.

270
00:21:57,623 --> 00:21:58,283
They're interested.

271
00:21:58,323 --> 00:22:01,083
They stop because there's graphics, there's color, there's something.

272
00:22:01,564 --> 00:22:12,026
And then when they go to the website, not that it turns into blah, but when you go to the website, then you can kind of drill down and find this different kind of information.

273
00:22:12,066 --> 00:22:16,607
And it almost looks like it'd be a little more of a about us or who we are, what we do.

274
00:22:17,441 --> 00:22:43,748
right and if someone if someone's gotten to that point that they've gone to the website to look at it they're probably interested enough to where they are going to read it anyway exactly okay so um i'm hearing that maybe we should stick with the trifold um i'm gonna go ahead and stop sharing this but um stick with the trifold but make it a little bit more

275
00:22:44,698 --> 00:22:49,521
You know, I'm definitely meant for it if I, but okay.

276
00:22:49,541 --> 00:22:58,847
So moving some contact information, make that front and center, adding in a call to come join us, whether as, as a member or just to join our meetings.

277
00:23:00,148 --> 00:23:01,349
Okay.

278
00:23:01,469 --> 00:23:03,230
That's, that was super helpful.

279
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:14,437
Cause I was trying to start it from scratch and you know, now I have a little bit of a direction, so I'm confident that our next meeting I'll have, I'll have one to review as well as a magnet.

280
00:23:15,109 --> 00:23:16,009
I love that idea.

281
00:23:16,029 --> 00:23:19,131
OK.

282
00:23:21,272 --> 00:23:23,493
Well, thank you, everybody, for that input.

283
00:23:23,513 --> 00:23:24,653
I super appreciate that.

284
00:23:24,674 --> 00:23:28,435
The next topic?

285
00:23:28,575 --> 00:23:29,076
Yeah.

286
00:23:29,276 --> 00:23:33,538
So Hillside Avenue, we're fielding a lot of phone calls, I guess.

287
00:23:33,618 --> 00:23:33,978
Yes.

288
00:23:34,178 --> 00:23:40,081
So these next two projects are just more awareness.

289
00:23:40,781 --> 00:23:42,842
So first, 20 Hillside Avenue.

290
00:23:43,528 --> 00:23:47,590
It's a home that is in the Hillside Avenue historic district right here in Medford Square.

291
00:23:48,251 --> 00:23:54,834
It recently went on the market and it sold like in two seconds to, we're presuming a cash buyer.

292
00:23:54,894 --> 00:24:00,877
So this is a home that definitely needs some restoration.

293
00:24:01,858 --> 00:24:04,059
The listing was very clear on that.

294
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:10,623
You can see from the photos, it had beautiful bones, but it definitely needs some work, I would say, as well as on the exterior.

295
00:24:11,243 --> 00:24:12,804
So this is more of a heads up.

296
00:24:13,282 --> 00:24:16,325
Maybe if you want to go drive by the house, buy it.

297
00:24:16,345 --> 00:24:20,008
Because I imagine that soon we will see something.

298
00:24:20,028 --> 00:24:24,071
Because somebody bought it with the intention of putting work into it.

299
00:24:26,233 --> 00:24:27,354
But yeah, it's a gorgeous house.

300
00:24:27,755 --> 00:24:32,959
I wish I had... I think it ended up selling for $810,000, which is a steal in Medford at this point.

301
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:33,660
So yeah.

302
00:24:40,737 --> 00:24:43,879
and the buyer is aware that it's a historic district house?

303
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:46,380
Yes, I will.

304
00:24:46,881 --> 00:24:52,864
I don't recall who the listing agent was, but I actually want to commend them for putting that front and center in the listing.

305
00:24:53,365 --> 00:25:06,012
You know, I think it was mentioned on three separate times, like, this is a historic district, which is why I was getting quite a few calls when it hit the market asking, OK, my buyers are interested in this.

306
00:25:06,232 --> 00:25:06,953
What does it mean?

307
00:25:06,993 --> 00:25:08,994
Like, what type, what would be the next steps?

308
00:25:09,807 --> 00:25:12,609
for if we were to buy this property and we want to do some work to it.

309
00:25:13,669 --> 00:25:22,715
And does the website have the guidelines listed on the MedFed Historic District Commission website?

310
00:25:23,175 --> 00:25:23,615
It does.

311
00:25:23,776 --> 00:25:36,083
I will say the website needs a bit of a sprucing up, but our guidelines and how to, you know, for anybody who had those questions of like, how do I, what do I do?

312
00:25:36,664 --> 00:25:40,325
owning a home in a historic district, they could eventually find that information online.

313
00:25:40,365 --> 00:25:41,145
It is out there.

314
00:25:41,685 --> 00:25:44,465
Just trying to make it a little bit easier for folks to find.

315
00:25:44,485 --> 00:25:50,206
I'm just trying to save you time from people like how did you on the phone?

316
00:25:50,226 --> 00:25:54,687
But I mean, even if you put attention, you know, yeah, it's still going to call you.

317
00:25:54,787 --> 00:25:54,967
Yeah.

318
00:25:55,107 --> 00:25:56,107
And that's that's OK.

319
00:25:56,207 --> 00:25:57,308
It's my job.

320
00:25:58,108 --> 00:25:59,668
It was just comical at one point.

321
00:25:59,688 --> 00:26:03,909
I think I talked to like eight people on the same day, just saying the same thing over and over again.

322
00:26:05,845 --> 00:26:07,126
Which is good, I'm glad they were calling.

323
00:26:07,146 --> 00:26:12,310
That means they were doing their due diligence rather than somebody just buying the property and then figuring it out afterwards.

324
00:26:13,971 --> 00:26:16,273
So again, no real action on this one.

325
00:26:16,333 --> 00:26:24,080
Just, you know, if you're so inclined, I might encourage you to take a walk by the house or drive by it just to acquaint yourself with it.

326
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:25,821
Because I'm sure something's coming soon.

327
00:26:29,624 --> 00:26:31,345
So that was 20 hillsides.

328
00:26:32,606 --> 00:26:33,327
And then we got 41 Mystic F.

329
00:26:34,792 --> 00:26:54,766
So yeah, 41 Mystic Ave, this board has been asked by the historical commission to, again, acquaint yourself with the property and then perhaps explore whether we would be interested in pursuing a historic district designation for this property.

330
00:26:55,706 --> 00:26:57,868
This property is 41 Mystic Ave.

331
00:26:57,908 --> 00:27:01,050
It sits on Mystic Ave, which is, as y'all know,

332
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,261
and very industrial area.

333
00:27:04,281 --> 00:27:10,662
It is being targeted as an area for rezoning and, you know, redevelopment.

334
00:27:11,162 --> 00:27:15,143
So right now it's a historic home that kind of sticks out in the middle of nowhere.

335
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:29,747
Is this that one that's next to the guitar shop that looks like it's going to... It actually has like... I'll pull it up here real quick and do an aerial view because it has what looks like a car lot all around it.

336
00:27:29,787 --> 00:27:29,887
Okay.

337
00:27:36,216 --> 00:27:38,317
I'm going to do another screen share.

338
00:27:38,357 --> 00:27:38,937
Sorry, folks.

339
00:27:39,938 --> 00:27:42,799
Hopefully you're not getting motion sickness from it all.

340
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:44,920
All right.

341
00:27:47,681 --> 00:27:49,162
So this is 41 Mystic.

342
00:27:49,202 --> 00:27:50,782
You should be seeing a property here.

343
00:27:52,623 --> 00:28:01,747
What's significant about this property, it is one of the last 12 buildings in Medford that are pre-18th century.

344
00:28:02,875 --> 00:28:05,117
This house was built in 1750.

345
00:28:05,157 --> 00:28:09,540
I know it doesn't really look significant.

346
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:15,224
It's certainly been hacked apart and added on and a dormer put in and all that stuff.

347
00:28:15,284 --> 00:28:20,028
So it doesn't obviously look like a 1750 house, but nevertheless.

348
00:28:21,249 --> 00:28:25,052
So what triggered the historic board to

349
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:28,131
Yeah, is he applied for a permit?

350
00:28:28,451 --> 00:28:33,573
Yeah, something the property owner has applied for a demolition permit to raise it to the ground.

351
00:28:33,913 --> 00:28:34,213
Okay.

352
00:28:34,934 --> 00:28:38,215
Um, just for everybody else's quick, just quick education.

353
00:28:38,235 --> 00:28:46,579
Uh, the historical commission, they review, um, all permit, um, all properties slated for even partial demo.

354
00:28:46,959 --> 00:28:49,100
If it's over 75 years old, the property.

355
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:52,181
So that's, that's their job is to evaluate.

356
00:28:52,281 --> 00:28:54,002
Should we try to preserve this house?

357
00:28:54,692 --> 00:28:59,895
or just allow it to go ahead and be demolished.

358
00:29:01,376 --> 00:29:03,957
Could you move us to the other side?

359
00:29:04,017 --> 00:29:05,718
Is that Columbia Road, I guess?

360
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:08,980
I think that's what the rest of the house looks like.

361
00:29:15,183 --> 00:29:15,583
Yeah.

362
00:29:16,404 --> 00:29:18,905
And if I do an aerial, which I can do,

363
00:29:27,847 --> 00:29:28,247
Sorry.

364
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:34,912
You can see that it is completely surrounded by cars.

365
00:29:34,972 --> 00:29:35,752
It's a car lot.

366
00:29:37,554 --> 00:29:38,174
Yeah.

367
00:29:38,314 --> 00:29:44,318
So there's nothing really interesting else about the property.

368
00:29:44,378 --> 00:29:45,979
It's just the home itself.

369
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:51,483
Another thing to note, this property has already been moved twice.

370
00:29:52,184 --> 00:29:53,204
I was just thinking that.

371
00:29:53,284 --> 00:29:54,745
I was going to ask that.

372
00:29:54,765 --> 00:29:55,866
What if they moved it?

373
00:29:55,886 --> 00:29:56,026
Yeah.

374
00:29:57,664 --> 00:30:16,148
Um, I recall it's it, the whole family, um, is significant to Medford because Isaac Hall was a captain in the, um, uh, and he was actually the, the first house that on Paul Revere's midnight ride that he stopped in and said, the British are coming.

375
00:30:16,168 --> 00:30:21,969
It was actually at captain Isaac Hall's house, um, which is right on, on main street.

376
00:30:22,809 --> 00:30:23,169
I'm sorry.

377
00:30:23,209 --> 00:30:23,629
High street.

378
00:30:24,611 --> 00:30:28,373
This house was owned by a member of the Hall family.

379
00:30:28,413 --> 00:30:33,575
I'm not sure if it was a uncle or brother, but Benjamin Hall owned the home.

380
00:30:34,215 --> 00:30:36,496
So there's a little bit of a historical tie there.

381
00:30:36,516 --> 00:30:40,598
I don't think anybody would say that this is a beautiful building.

382
00:30:40,898 --> 00:30:41,818
And gosh, look at that.

383
00:30:41,858 --> 00:30:51,522
Isn't it so lovely historic, but it does have significance for its, you know, the pedigree of the house has significance.

384
00:30:52,062 --> 00:30:52,923
Was it always,

385
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:55,240
That size?

386
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,601
I mean, that seems like a pretty big house.

387
00:31:00,242 --> 00:31:01,963
Yeah, I think it's a four.

388
00:31:04,364 --> 00:31:05,724
I'm pretty sure it was.

389
00:31:05,944 --> 00:31:07,705
I think I have the 40.

390
00:31:08,785 --> 00:31:09,586
Actually, hold on.

391
00:31:09,986 --> 00:31:10,566
I might have.

392
00:31:12,307 --> 00:31:14,287
In the meeting packet.

393
00:31:15,048 --> 00:31:21,870
Yeah, I actually just stopped sharing because I'm sharing this.

394
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:22,751
I'm so sorry.

395
00:31:27,313 --> 00:31:37,199
1752.

396
00:31:27,393 --> 00:31:37,199
Here we go.

397
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,841
I'm scrolling through to see.

398
00:31:39,901 --> 00:31:43,683
I think there was, again, I'm so sorry about that.

399
00:31:44,203 --> 00:31:45,944
There we go.

400
00:31:45,964 --> 00:31:46,304
Okay.

401
00:31:47,505 --> 00:31:50,947
So it was originally at the foot of Governor's Ave where enters High Street.

402
00:31:53,254 --> 00:32:07,901
So it looks like there was an addition in the back perhaps, but overall, I think the footprint really doesn't seem to have changed too much.

403
00:32:08,722 --> 00:32:09,782
No, no, maybe.

404
00:32:12,944 --> 00:32:14,024
But regardless, so

405
00:32:17,642 --> 00:32:20,524
The property owner has not requested this.

406
00:32:20,544 --> 00:32:28,730
This is coming from the historical commission to see if we would support this property being put into a local historic district.

407
00:32:32,953 --> 00:32:38,016
I mean, we could, we could reach out to the property owner and see if they're interested in that.

408
00:32:38,417 --> 00:32:41,819
I don't think they're going to be seeing that they'll demolish it.

409
00:32:41,839 --> 00:32:41,939
Yes.

410
00:32:44,867 --> 00:32:48,189
A thought I had was, heck, this house has already moved twice.

411
00:32:48,269 --> 00:32:51,752
Could it be picked up and moved again, and then maybe donated?

412
00:32:51,772 --> 00:32:58,436
Again, it's not a beautiful piece of architecture.

413
00:32:58,456 --> 00:33:01,559
And it doesn't need to be.

414
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:02,479
It doesn't need to be.

415
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:05,321
But your thoughts?

416
00:33:09,084 --> 00:33:10,465
I think the thing that gets me is

417
00:33:11,591 --> 00:33:13,134
just the age of the house.

418
00:33:13,434 --> 00:33:15,017
It's survived this long.

419
00:33:16,379 --> 00:33:19,665
I mean, it was built before America was America.

420
00:33:20,266 --> 00:33:21,267
Yes.

421
00:33:22,429 --> 00:33:24,613
And it just seems to me that even

422
00:33:25,005 --> 00:33:33,509
even though if you were going to bring it back to that photograph, you know, looking at that picture, I mean, it would need a lot of restoration work.

423
00:33:33,849 --> 00:33:42,593
It would, I mean, you know, maybe if fingers crossed, if you tore off all the vinyl siding and stuff like that, maybe all that coining is still there.

424
00:33:42,713 --> 00:33:45,074
Maybe the old siding is still there.

425
00:33:45,094 --> 00:33:46,595
Maybe, maybe, maybe, I don't know.

426
00:33:47,255 --> 00:33:52,558
But it's kind of one of those things where, what would you do with it?

427
00:33:53,228 --> 00:34:19,042
you know where where where could it go where could it be reused is there is there any place in Medford or for that matter in one of the abutting communities that they would want a visitor center they have a park where it could go in and said it could be used for something there I mean is there anything anything like that you know because otherwise I

428
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:22,581
I don't really know what you do with it.

429
00:34:22,681 --> 00:34:30,483
And if you put it in a historic district and prevent people from tearing it down, or really doing a whole lot to it, would it then start to suffer?

430
00:34:30,563 --> 00:34:34,224
Because what is somebody gonna do with it where it's located now?

431
00:34:35,425 --> 00:34:45,948
Other than maybe make it into the office of a business or something, you know, maybe I'm making this, you know, electrician buys it and that becomes their office for their business or something, I don't know.

432
00:34:48,191 --> 00:34:58,778
When was it, so the Dormer addition, and that I'd assume was done when it was moved, when was it moved from, to the location that it is now?

433
00:34:59,399 --> 00:35:08,324
I want to say it was, the first time it was moved, I think it was late 1800s.

434
00:35:14,625 --> 00:35:17,387
It says that it was 1835 to 1894.

435
00:35:17,487 --> 00:35:18,068
Is that the one?

436
00:35:18,408 --> 00:35:18,728
Yes.

437
00:35:19,148 --> 00:35:19,429
Yes.

438
00:35:20,189 --> 00:35:20,650
Thank you.

439
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:26,173
And then it was moved again in like the 19th?

440
00:35:27,074 --> 00:35:30,877
Yeah.

441
00:35:32,037 --> 00:35:36,040
I can certainly pull that information together.

442
00:35:37,261 --> 00:35:41,244
It is, you know, this form B, which again was in the meeting packet.

443
00:35:41,832 --> 00:35:44,393
I would encourage folks to read through it thoroughly.

444
00:35:45,033 --> 00:35:51,315
It is pretty comprehensive about the history of the home.

445
00:35:54,096 --> 00:35:56,157
Again, big takeaways here.

446
00:35:57,177 --> 00:36:03,319
I don't know for certain, but I doubt there would be support from the property owner.

447
00:36:04,581 --> 00:36:06,602
to keep it in its place.

448
00:36:07,762 --> 00:36:20,786
And the argument's going to be that it's, so yeah, the part of it is, you know, 1700s or whatever, but then it got moved at a much later time and then altered at that time.

449
00:36:20,806 --> 00:36:28,448
You're going to get the, you know, the George Washington's X argument, which is, you know,

450
00:36:29,598 --> 00:36:34,982
I have George Washington's axe, the handle's been replaced five times, and the head's been replaced three times.

451
00:36:35,002 --> 00:36:35,362
Right.

452
00:36:35,622 --> 00:36:35,922
You know?

453
00:36:36,263 --> 00:36:36,483
Yeah.

454
00:36:37,643 --> 00:36:38,184
Oh, when's this?

455
00:36:38,384 --> 00:36:39,905
Okay, so this one's showing the dormer.

456
00:36:39,945 --> 00:36:43,307
What year is that?

457
00:36:44,348 --> 00:36:47,330
1800s, circa late 1800s, late 1890s.

458
00:36:49,191 --> 00:36:55,816
So this is it, where it's currently at, yeah, corner of Columbia and Mystic.

459
00:36:56,656 --> 00:36:57,577
The work that was, I mean,

460
00:36:58,897 --> 00:37:01,879
The work done to the front of it looks nice.

461
00:37:02,759 --> 00:37:03,840
Is there an incentive?

462
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:08,643
Is there something that can be done to incentivize moving it?

463
00:37:08,663 --> 00:37:15,667
There's not a lot of places to put it.

464
00:37:16,508 --> 00:37:19,610
That would be a much bigger conversation than I think this board.

465
00:37:21,461 --> 00:37:30,785
My understanding is that the intention is to demolish and then put something that's, you know, multiple stories high, really dense housing.

466
00:37:30,865 --> 00:37:32,526
I believe that's my understanding.

467
00:37:32,706 --> 00:37:32,966
Yeah.

468
00:37:33,967 --> 00:37:47,273
You know, whether or not the project is by right by the zoning that's there, you know, there might be, I don't want to say an opportunity for negotiation, but, you know, as part of the review of that, maybe there's a little,

469
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,081
Hey, would you be willing to do this?

470
00:37:49,461 --> 00:37:52,903
I don't think the city could compel them to, certainly.

471
00:37:53,944 --> 00:37:57,646
But at least there's an opportunity to maybe have a conversation there.

472
00:37:57,666 --> 00:38:00,688
I don't know who would pay for that.

473
00:38:00,708 --> 00:38:02,089
I don't know where it would go.

474
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:04,070
There's a lot of questions there.

475
00:38:05,691 --> 00:38:07,772
If we were to move the house again.

476
00:38:07,792 --> 00:38:07,873
Yeah.

477
00:38:15,125 --> 00:38:21,390
I will say that the city, I reiterate, the city is looking to revitalize the Mystic Ave corridor.

478
00:38:21,431 --> 00:38:29,017
So, you know, single family, two families aren't really the direction.

479
00:38:29,037 --> 00:38:38,205
And it's kind of vision, you know, I mean, the whole area changed around this house, you know, like in the back.

480
00:38:38,225 --> 00:38:38,345
Yeah.

481
00:38:38,405 --> 00:38:38,505
Um, so.

482
00:38:44,622 --> 00:38:52,349
But it is a 1750s house that is still standing and still gets mail delivered to it.

483
00:38:52,409 --> 00:38:57,474
So it's something to strongly consider.

484
00:38:59,596 --> 00:39:09,906
And honestly, other than that two-story piece that they kind of stuck on the front of it, the dormer has been there since

485
00:39:11,428 --> 00:39:11,488
1800s.

486
00:39:12,189 --> 00:39:27,616
So I would almost I would almost consider that I would consider that to be kind of historic because okay, how many how many historic houses are around that also have additions that his family's got bigger as you know, whatever happened, they reuse things like that.

487
00:39:27,696 --> 00:39:31,658
So actually quite a bit of that house is intact.

488
00:39:32,218 --> 00:39:34,539
I mean, it's all the form of it is still there.

489
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:38,181
Yeah, you know, so it's not like it's been

490
00:39:38,969 --> 00:39:47,598
It's not like it's been butchered to pieces and it's like, you know, like we said, yeah, we've changed the handle five times and the head three times.

491
00:39:47,638 --> 00:39:52,622
You know, it's like, no, it's still pretty close, you know.

492
00:39:54,104 --> 00:39:56,286
So I don't know.

493
00:39:56,506 --> 00:40:03,153
I guess if it could be moved and if there was a use for it, whether it was to be used for residential or for some other purpose,

494
00:40:03,972 --> 00:40:06,493
If there was a way to do it, I'd try that.

495
00:40:07,213 --> 00:40:12,335
But if not, I mean, it really doesn't belong where it is anymore.

496
00:40:13,196 --> 00:40:16,777
Yeah, I want to see it saved, but I don't.

497
00:40:17,998 --> 00:40:19,138
Maybe not in that location.

498
00:40:19,158 --> 00:40:20,259
Yeah, not in that location.

499
00:40:20,299 --> 00:40:23,780
I'd like to do whatever it takes to move that.

500
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,601
Whatever would help move it that we could do.

501
00:40:28,077 --> 00:40:32,338
Cause the thing is, is it's going to be a lot of money to renovate that too.

502
00:40:32,418 --> 00:40:35,818
And it's just a losing situation for whoever's going to be doing that.

503
00:40:35,838 --> 00:40:36,378
Yeah.

504
00:40:36,959 --> 00:40:40,559
But maybe somebody would be really excited about the projects.

505
00:40:40,679 --> 00:40:42,499
Some, I have no idea.

506
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:51,121
Um, it's, it's having a, I mean the money it's having a bank that's, you know, cause they're the ones that, you know, okay, let's, what's the appraised value.

507
00:40:51,361 --> 00:40:51,621
Okay.

508
00:40:51,641 --> 00:40:53,461
We're not lending you the money, you know?

509
00:40:53,801 --> 00:40:54,001
Yeah.

510
00:40:54,722 --> 00:40:55,002
Yeah.

511
00:40:55,102 --> 00:40:55,582
I've been there.

512
00:40:55,602 --> 00:40:57,122
I've been down that road a bunch of times.

513
00:41:01,449 --> 00:41:22,880
Okay, well, when I'm hearing, just because the historical commission has asked for our thoughts on this, they haven't asked for official support or an opinion or anything, I'll take back to them that it sounds like we would love to see the building preserved.

514
00:41:25,883 --> 00:41:27,184
I'm sorry, you mind?

515
00:41:27,824 --> 00:41:29,245
Could we reach out to the homeowner?

516
00:41:29,285 --> 00:41:30,165
Because you never know.

517
00:41:30,386 --> 00:41:36,069
Because the thing, look, I mean, there are programs, there's some type of incentive.

518
00:41:36,809 --> 00:41:42,212
You know, we can do whatever we can do to help him out to get those programs.

519
00:41:42,452 --> 00:41:43,573
And you never know.

520
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:46,875
Yeah.

521
00:41:46,975 --> 00:41:52,818
And at this point, the only information I have about the property owner's position on this

522
00:41:53,544 --> 00:41:55,345
is that they applied for a demolition permit.

523
00:41:55,365 --> 00:41:56,426
So who knows?

524
00:41:58,208 --> 00:42:03,752
Yeah, I'd be comfortable reaching out to them just to have an initial conversation.

525
00:42:03,772 --> 00:42:10,017
And they may tell me to pound sand, and that's fine.

526
00:42:10,077 --> 00:42:18,723
But at least we'll have an opportunity to talk about doing something alternative with this rather than just taking it down to the ground.

527
00:42:19,063 --> 00:42:21,365
Then you can get into the conversation of moving it.

528
00:42:21,585 --> 00:42:22,366
Yeah, yeah.

529
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:25,841
So everybody would be okay with me.

530
00:42:25,861 --> 00:42:33,684
I do want to do have the follow-up with the historical commission just as like an informal, just like here's where we're feeling right now.

531
00:42:34,204 --> 00:42:39,026
So if everybody's okay with it, I'll say we believe in preserving the building.

532
00:42:39,466 --> 00:42:43,948
We want to explore with the homeowner whether they'd be open to moving the property again.

533
00:42:43,968 --> 00:42:45,849
Yeah.

534
00:42:45,869 --> 00:42:46,609
That would be okay?

535
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:47,149
Yeah.

536
00:42:47,229 --> 00:42:47,650
All right.

537
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:49,891
I don't want you putting words in anybody else's mouth.

538
00:42:49,931 --> 00:42:51,251
No, very well put.

539
00:42:52,011 --> 00:42:53,092
Was the initial idea,

540
00:42:54,553 --> 00:43:00,938
and I think it was said when we started talking about this, to somehow incorporate it into a local district.

541
00:43:01,178 --> 00:43:02,779
Is there a local district anywhere?

542
00:43:02,799 --> 00:43:02,839
No.

543
00:43:02,859 --> 00:43:15,247
Yeah, I also think that would be, I mean, I know if I was the owner of that house and all of a sudden, oh, hey, yeah, we put it on a historic district because we want to stop you.

544
00:43:16,108 --> 00:43:19,830
It's like, nah, I don't think that would go over too well.

545
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:20,931
Yeah.

546
00:43:22,091 --> 00:43:22,692
We don't want to be

547
00:43:23,569 --> 00:43:26,671
those people who would do that to somebody, quite honestly.

548
00:43:26,771 --> 00:43:32,153
I think that would be more ill will than anything else.

549
00:43:32,313 --> 00:43:33,514
That's a good point.

550
00:43:33,534 --> 00:43:46,461
That's why approaching it like this incentive, saying, hey, this incentives with the grants or whatever, did you explore these options?

551
00:43:46,481 --> 00:43:49,982
This board is more than willing to help you with that.

552
00:43:50,643 --> 00:43:53,224
I bet he might be receptive to that or maybe not, who knows.

553
00:43:53,812 --> 00:43:54,672
I don't know.

554
00:43:55,413 --> 00:43:57,814
But we should talk to them and see.

555
00:43:57,854 --> 00:43:58,354
But OK.

556
00:43:59,454 --> 00:44:00,295
Thank you very much.

557
00:44:00,675 --> 00:44:05,757
I will reach out to my friend on the Historical Commission just to have an informal.

558
00:44:05,817 --> 00:44:13,781
And then I'll reach out to the property owner and just have a casual conversation with them, see what can come of that.

559
00:44:15,581 --> 00:44:15,861
Awesome.

560
00:44:15,881 --> 00:44:16,142
Great.

561
00:44:17,002 --> 00:44:17,542
All right.

562
00:44:18,282 --> 00:44:19,623
Well, thank you very much on that.

563
00:44:19,643 --> 00:44:21,644
And I think the only thing we have left is

564
00:44:22,814 --> 00:44:36,282
I have the meeting minutes in the folder, which, where's my, reorienting myself here.

565
00:44:39,144 --> 00:44:49,230
So meeting minutes, I did not have them ready to go for the walking tour we did, because I'm not sure how to wrap my head around those minutes quite yet.

566
00:44:50,337 --> 00:44:56,059
It wasn't a formal sit-down meeting, but we do have to have some sort of minutes captured for that.

567
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:15,267
I also have a copy of the minutes here for you, Joe, but do we want to... I guess you would be looking, Joe, for a motion to accept the minutes.

568
00:45:30,655 --> 00:45:35,204
Looks great, so did anyone read through that and make a motion to accept it?

569
00:46:00,202 --> 00:46:01,323
Motion to accept the minutes.

570
00:46:03,444 --> 00:46:03,784
All right.

571
00:46:04,585 --> 00:46:06,006
Can someone second that?

572
00:46:08,887 --> 00:46:10,648
I wasn't present, but then I can second it.

573
00:46:10,908 --> 00:46:11,609
It's pretty clear.

574
00:46:12,369 --> 00:46:12,609
Great.

575
00:46:12,809 --> 00:46:13,150
Okay.

576
00:46:13,450 --> 00:46:14,571
So let's take a vote.

577
00:46:14,611 --> 00:46:14,951
James?

578
00:46:16,151 --> 00:46:16,392
Yes.

579
00:46:16,712 --> 00:46:18,053
I. Has he done?

580
00:46:18,873 --> 00:46:19,073
Yes.

581
00:46:20,074 --> 00:46:21,014
And I vote yes, too.

582
00:46:21,054 --> 00:46:21,635
So it's good.

583
00:46:21,775 --> 00:46:22,315
It's accepted.

584
00:46:22,595 --> 00:46:23,616
Thank you very much.

585
00:46:23,856 --> 00:46:25,997
Again, you're just voting to accept the minutes.

586
00:46:28,171 --> 00:46:31,893
Vouch for what's in them, you know, that's all the stuff on the agenda.

587
00:46:31,913 --> 00:46:34,714
Does anyone else have anything they want to bring up?

588
00:46:34,754 --> 00:46:35,775
But do or.

589
00:46:37,395 --> 00:46:38,736
No, I'm good.

590
00:46:39,376 --> 00:46:39,736
All right.

591
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:43,898
So our next meeting would be on November 13th.

592
00:46:43,918 --> 00:46:44,379
Sounds good.

593
00:46:50,222 --> 00:46:54,345
Okay, if there's any conflicts, let me know, but I'll send out.

594
00:46:54,585 --> 00:46:55,285
Was that helpful?

595
00:46:55,345 --> 00:47:01,229
I feel like I may have been obnoxious with the amount of reminders for this meeting, but was that helpful for everybody?

596
00:47:01,249 --> 00:47:02,070
It was helpful.

597
00:47:02,090 --> 00:47:02,610
Yes, yes.

598
00:47:02,890 --> 00:47:05,572
I'm not going to lie to you.

599
00:47:05,812 --> 00:47:07,793
I thought it was, I was so turned around this week.

600
00:47:07,853 --> 00:47:08,794
I thought it was Tuesday.

601
00:47:09,642 --> 00:47:14,443
And then when I saw it tonight, I was just about ready to head out the door from my office.

602
00:47:14,483 --> 00:47:15,163
And I'm like, dope.

603
00:47:15,243 --> 00:47:16,343
So I sat back.

604
00:47:17,003 --> 00:47:18,444
So thank you.

605
00:47:18,604 --> 00:47:19,024
Thank you.

606
00:47:19,044 --> 00:47:19,964
I appreciate that.

607
00:47:20,624 --> 00:47:20,884
All right.

608
00:47:21,544 --> 00:47:21,924
That's great.

609
00:47:22,385 --> 00:47:26,365
So if everything's all set, can we make a motion to close the meeting?

610
00:47:27,646 --> 00:47:29,746
Motion to close the meeting?

611
00:47:30,446 --> 00:47:31,746
Can you second that?

612
00:47:31,766 --> 00:47:32,086
All right.

613
00:47:32,126 --> 00:47:33,007
Let's have a vote on that.

614
00:47:33,987 --> 00:47:34,307
James?

615
00:47:34,847 --> 00:47:35,027
Yes.

616
00:47:36,889 --> 00:47:37,090
Yes.

617
00:47:37,190 --> 00:47:38,874
And I vote yes as well.

618
00:47:38,894 --> 00:47:39,736
So the meeting's over.

619
00:47:39,756 --> 00:47:40,778
All right.

620
00:47:40,798 --> 00:47:42,000
See you guys next month.

621
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:42,902
Thanks, everybody.

622
00:47:42,922 --> 00:47:43,424
Thank you.

623
00:47:43,444 --> 00:47:43,524
Bye.
