It's important.

53
00:01:10,511 --> 00:01:11,594
It's important.

54
00:01:39,692 --> 00:01:42,335
I'm going to give you a quick rundown of what we've been up to.

55
00:01:42,375 --> 00:01:43,075
We've had a lot of fun.

56
00:01:43,115 --> 00:01:43,976
We've had a lot of fun.

57
00:01:44,016 --> 00:01:44,857
We've had a lot of fun.

58
00:01:44,897 --> 00:01:45,998
We've had a lot of fun.

59
00:01:46,038 --> 00:01:46,859
We've had a lot of fun.

60
00:01:46,899 --> 00:01:47,639
We've had a lot of fun.

61
00:01:47,679 --> 00:01:48,580
We've had a lot of fun.

62
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,161
We've had a lot of fun.

63
00:01:49,221 --> 00:01:49,942
We've had a lot of fun.

64
00:01:50,082 --> 00:01:51,363
We've had a lot of fun.

65
00:01:51,443 --> 00:01:52,464
We've had a lot of fun.

66
00:01:52,504 --> 00:01:53,265
We've had a lot of fun.

67
00:01:53,325 --> 00:01:54,246
We've had a lot of fun.

68
00:01:54,266 --> 00:01:55,587
We've had a lot of fun.

69
00:01:55,607 --> 00:01:56,648
We've had a lot of fun.

70
00:01:56,668 --> 00:01:57,408
We've had a lot of fun.

71
00:01:57,428 --> 00:01:58,309
We've had a lot of fun.

72
00:01:58,409 --> 00:01:59,130
We've had a lot of fun.

73
00:01:59,190 --> 00:01:59,871
We've had a lot of fun.

74
00:01:59,971 --> 00:02:01,112
We've had a lot of fun.

75
00:02:01,132 --> 00:02:01,913
We've had a lot of fun.

76
00:02:01,933 --> 00:02:02,733
We've had a lot of fun.

77
00:02:02,753 --> 00:02:03,594
We've had a lot of fun.

78
00:02:03,634 --> 00:02:04,715
We've had a lot of fun.

79
00:02:04,775 --> 00:02:05,276
We've had a lot of fun.

80
00:02:05,296 --> 00:02:05,716
We've had a lot of

81
00:02:12,562 --> 00:02:25,068
So I'd first like to talk about a poll that I took.

82
00:02:25,989 --> 00:02:31,112
I asked my friends if they feel safe in school or not.

83
00:02:31,252 --> 00:02:34,413
And 13 out of 14 of them said they weren't.

84
00:02:34,894 --> 00:02:36,114
And that's 93%.

85
00:02:36,434 --> 00:02:39,096
An accurate or acceptable number.

86
00:02:40,463 --> 00:02:47,526
So we need to do more to try to make the children feel safe in school.

87
00:02:49,667 --> 00:02:57,990
Because our schools are supposed to be more safe than our homes, and we're not sure where we're supposed to feel safe anymore.

88
00:02:59,167 --> 00:03:01,629
I'd also like to talk about the Los Angeles.

89
00:03:02,609 --> 00:03:06,912
I've been going to Mexico City for two or three years since kindergarten, and we've had one.

90
00:03:07,092 --> 00:03:09,874
And we sat in the pool and hung out all day.

91
00:03:09,894 --> 00:03:22,382
I feel like you all can tell the other sisters, and it's hard to explain, but that's all I'm going to say.

92
00:03:27,849 --> 00:03:46,437
I would like to ask that we would get the chance to have a few student speakers who should be able to speak this evening and maybe talk a little bit more before we get to the session.

93
00:03:54,876 --> 00:04:16,109
I worked in the mayor's office, the mayor's office, the mayor's office, the mayor's office, the mayor's office, the mayor's office, the mayor's office, the mayor's office, the mayor's office, the mayor's office, the mayor's office, the mayor's office, the mayor's office, the mayor's office, the mayor's office, the mayor's office, the mayor's office, the mayor's office, the mayor's office, the mayor's office, the mayor's office, the mayor's office, the mayor's office, the mayor's office, the mayor's office, the mayor's office, the mayor's office, the mayor's office, the mayor's office, the mayor's office, the mayor's office, the mayor's office, the mayor's office, the mayor's office, the mayor's office, the mayor's office, the mayor's office, the mayor's office, the mayor's office, the mayor's office, the mayor's office, the mayor's office, the mayor's office, the mayor's office, the

94
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:27,889
Now, we spend more time concentrating on the value and the quality of health of the people that are suffering or making it through this slower community.

95
00:04:27,929 --> 00:04:34,096
Slower also means that we, the parents, we have spoken to a lot of people in the community.

96
00:04:34,256 --> 00:04:39,742
When we do our speech, we prefer to go into the community and let them know about us.

97
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,861
that we have to see.

98
00:04:44,881 --> 00:04:46,641
So with that, I want to thank you guys for being here.

99
00:04:46,902 --> 00:04:48,922
Thank you for coming out tonight.

100
00:04:49,463 --> 00:04:49,683

159
00:05:05,769 --> 00:05:06,009
Thank you.

160
00:05:06,029 --> 00:05:06,229
Thank you.

161
00:05:06,269 --> 00:05:06,529
Thank you.

162
00:05:06,569 --> 00:05:06,930
Thank you.

163
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:07,350
Thank you.

164
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:07,710
Thank you.

165
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:07,970
Thank you

166
00:05:12,539 --> 00:05:14,783
they've heard about and listened for.

167
00:05:16,085 --> 00:05:20,091
In the past, we've been trying to think of a new way to stop it.

168
00:05:20,131 --> 00:05:24,578
But really, there's a long-term vision or a plan that we're hopeful of.

169
00:05:28,802 --> 00:05:30,704
a lot of time with our teachers.

170
00:05:30,785 --> 00:05:36,932
So when we feel that there is a problem in the classroom with our teachers, what's the worst that can happen?

171
00:05:36,952 --> 00:05:42,159
We do some things here to help contribute to the dialogue.

172
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:46,444
And if someone really, really, really wants our help, we will be happy.

173
00:05:47,813 --> 00:05:52,937
But we feel people don't think about you when you're a disabled single adult person.

174
00:05:54,018 --> 00:05:57,000
And I agree with you about how a lot of what we know matters.

175
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:00,282
It doesn't matter how we've been present here.

176
00:06:00,843 --> 00:06:03,785
And I don't know, but each of us do our part.

177
00:06:03,865 --> 00:06:09,029
And my advice is, you need to engage with males lately.

178
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,671
They're not the same age.

179
00:06:11,731 --> 00:06:14,053
They're not the equal age as you.

180
00:06:14,093 --> 00:06:15,454
Don't tell me, well, I'm a woman.

181
00:06:15,554 --> 00:06:16,635
I'm not a girl.

182
00:06:24,505 --> 00:06:30,776
Listen to public opinion and know what you can expect, listen to your heart, listen to your soul.

183
00:06:30,836 --> 00:06:32,779
Listen to your dreams, grow past your fears.

184
00:06:33,955 --> 00:06:35,876
and all that we have seen through the years.

185
00:06:36,756 --> 00:06:42,019
Recently, I was talking with a friend about this, and a friend kept telling me about this.

186
00:06:42,059 --> 00:06:49,662
He reminded me that this isn't who we are, that our remembrance is not what we are when we think of who we are as a community.

187
00:06:50,442 --> 00:06:55,585
Who we are is a community that has its own representative and social problem.

188
00:07:50,012 --> 00:07:52,566
I'm going to have to get out of this thing.

189
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:31,627
Oh my god.

190
00:11:14,997 --> 00:11:18,940
to have a conversation about NHS security and a way to move forward.

191
00:11:21,382 --> 00:11:37,175
As students are the people that security is meant to protect, they came to the table today with ways that would help them feel more comfortable preparing for AP exams and practicing for a basketball game, the things that they knew really well.

192
00:11:39,357 --> 00:11:53,183
There's no longer any excuse for talks about security and gun safety to solve as students are an untapped resource that need to be dependent on when moving forward and making decisions in this issue.

193
00:11:54,504 --> 00:12:00,707
For now, the students will walk out on March 14th and we will fight for a future where we will feel more safe.

194
00:12:01,812 --> 00:12:05,015
For now, number one, the culture of secrecy is over in New Medford.

195
00:12:05,035 --> 00:12:10,260
Medford is changing and we have new expectations for the integrity of our school teachers.

196
00:12:11,101 --> 00:12:17,166
Number two, we are willing to talk about a compromise between safety and freedom.

197
00:12:18,608 --> 00:12:21,451
And number three, we don't want a culture of fear.

198
00:12:21,992 --> 00:12:33,045
We don't need metal detectors at every front door, but we want to have a part in making our education, our future, and our lives safe.

199
00:12:33,366 --> 00:12:33,626
Thank you.

200
00:12:36,369 --> 00:12:39,250
I'm going to make a motion to go into executive session.

201
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:39,830
Is there a second?

202
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:40,871
Seconds on this prep.

203
00:12:41,591 --> 00:12:42,051
Roll call vote.

204
00:12:51,775 --> 00:13:06,785
I want to make sure that every person feels heard, and that there's nothing, I don't want to repeat what happened the other night by any means, but I was away, and I just want to make sure that every person is ready for us to move forward before we do that.

205
00:13:07,645 --> 00:13:11,728
There's a motion on the floor to go into executive session, seconded by Ms.

206
00:13:11,748 --> 00:13:12,128
Crosby.

207
00:13:12,148 --> 00:13:13,409
There's a roll call vote.

208
00:13:13,489 --> 00:13:15,670
I'm sorry, there's motions on the floor.

209
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:16,731
Can we see them together?

210
00:13:17,591 --> 00:13:17,692
No.

211
00:13:19,475 --> 00:13:19,775
Yeah.

212
00:13:19,835 --> 00:13:20,075
Yeah.

213
00:13:20,155 --> 00:13:20,376
Yeah.

214
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,420
Yes.

215
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,582
About a four in the affirmative, three in the negative.

216
00:13:49,622 --> 00:13:52,184
We will now enter executive session.

217
00:13:52,684 --> 00:13:54,546
We will come out at the conclusion of that.

218
00:13:55,026 --> 00:13:56,568
Hello everyone.

219
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:12,149
Thank you so much for remaining here for this very important matter that we just took under consideration for multiple hours.

220
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:18,433
And at this point in time, I'd like to announce what the committee has adopted in executive session.

221
00:14:20,494 --> 00:14:26,977
Effective April 30th, mutually, the superintendent will retire from the city of Medford public schools.

222
00:14:28,512 --> 00:14:34,680
He shall coordinate any and all security issues with the chief of police or his designee going forward.

223
00:14:36,422 --> 00:14:45,234
No administrative, principal, personnel appointments or non-contractual salary adjustments without the approval of the school committee.

224
00:14:46,602 --> 00:14:58,532
And after April 30th, this committee will contract with the current superintendent for budget and transition up to 25 hours a week at its current hourly rate.

225
00:15:00,037 --> 00:15:04,941
Also, while we were in committee, we discussed many other items that are germane to this conversation.

226
00:15:06,102 --> 00:15:15,489
First and foremost, we believe that there should be a director of security for public buildings, and we will do everything we can to work with the city council in order to do so.

227
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:22,015
That will take consideration of the school department buildings as well as the city buildings that we maintain.

228
00:15:23,511 --> 00:15:30,076
We will work on enhanced communication protocols with our community relations subcommittee that Mr. Ruggiero is the chair of.

229
00:15:31,037 --> 00:15:33,198
We will move forward on ALICE training.

230
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:37,601
We will establish a school safety advisory committee.

231
00:15:39,283 --> 00:15:45,867
We will publicize the tip line that we currently have in place for our police department that can be utilized for other matters.

232
00:15:45,947 --> 00:15:51,892
And we really want the students at Medford High to be aware of that tip line so that they can use it if they see fit.

233
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:58,454
We will pursue a security audit of the schools in conjunction with the city council.

234
00:16:01,196 --> 00:16:05,780
I believe that takes care of all the matters that we discussed in executive session.

235
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:11,740
Ms.

236
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:12,620
Bandicloup?

237
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:12,920
Ms.

238
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:13,421
Bandicloup.

239
00:16:13,761 --> 00:16:16,722
I believe that we wanted to take up one of our policies now.

240
00:16:17,482 --> 00:16:18,342
We need a vote on this.

241
00:16:18,862 --> 00:16:18,962
Oh.

242
00:16:19,862 --> 00:16:20,603
Motion of approval.

243
00:16:20,623 --> 00:16:22,623
There's a motion on the floor for approval of this.

244
00:16:22,643 --> 00:16:23,003
Seconded.

245
00:16:23,063 --> 00:16:24,904
Seconded by Mrs. Kretz.

246
00:16:25,504 --> 00:16:26,544
Roll call vote please.

247
00:16:26,864 --> 00:16:27,865
Mrs. DiBenedetto?

248
00:16:28,425 --> 00:16:28,665
No.

249
00:16:29,385 --> 00:16:30,285
Mrs. Kretz, yes.

250
00:16:30,606 --> 00:16:31,386
Mrs. Mestone?

251
00:16:31,426 --> 00:16:31,666
Yes.

252
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:33,086
Mr. Ruggiero?

253
00:16:33,106 --> 00:16:33,146
No.

254
00:16:34,387 --> 00:16:34,487
No.

255
00:16:36,093 --> 00:16:36,253
No.

256
00:16:37,354 --> 00:16:38,075
Mr. Russo?

257
00:16:38,295 --> 00:16:38,575
Yes.

258
00:16:39,376 --> 00:16:40,277
Mrs. Van de Kloot?

259
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:40,657
Yes.

260
00:16:41,238 --> 00:16:41,758
Mayor Burke?

261
00:16:42,058 --> 00:16:42,358
Yes.

262
00:16:42,379 --> 00:16:44,180
5 in the affirmative, 2 in the negative.

263
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,121
The motion passes.

264
00:16:46,702 --> 00:16:52,307
Also, as people are aware, we had an incident report policy that was in place.

265
00:16:53,188 --> 00:17:00,874
We have worked over the last few days with both our deputy superintendent and our assistant superintendent and the superintendent.

266
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:04,117
to really beef this policy up.

267
00:17:04,918 --> 00:17:07,300
And the school committee was just given this tonight.

268
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,222
So there hasn't been a lot of time to look at it.

269
00:17:09,262 --> 00:17:12,105
But we really feel strongly that something needs to be put in place.

270
00:17:12,746 --> 00:17:14,387
So this may be a starting point.

271
00:17:14,507 --> 00:17:20,753
And over the course of the next few meetings, should we need amendments to this policy, certainly we will entertain them.

272
00:17:21,054 --> 00:17:26,519
But at this point, we want to get a very strong policy in place that captures some of the

273
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,422
some of the items that may have transpired.

274
00:17:30,102 --> 00:17:37,289
And I know that Mr. Russo will have an amendment, but basically we've set up this incident report policy with the following definitions.

275
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:39,091
Discovery.

276
00:17:40,277 --> 00:17:43,119
It has three pillars, discovery, notification, and disposition.

277
00:17:43,219 --> 00:17:54,108
Discovery, finding any object or observing any situation that applies to the safety and security of the school and or school district, which would negatively impact the well-being of students, faculty, and staff.

278
00:17:55,089 --> 00:18:01,433
Notification, verbal and or written communication to the appropriate authority, including but not limited to the police department.

279
00:18:02,334 --> 00:18:13,852
Disposition, reporting of actions taken and conclusions reached that describe and explain the nature of the threat and or behavior identified, as well as any recommendations that emerge from the investigation.

280
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:32,281
So the policy, the draft policy that's before us tonight reads, any individual discovers an item including but not limited to weapons, ammunition, explosives, drugs, any contraband items shall notify the Medford Police Department immediately and inform the principal.

281
00:18:33,162 --> 00:18:38,446
If the principal cannot be reached, the individual who discovers the item should notify the superintendent of schools.

282
00:18:39,107 --> 00:18:42,970
This process will be in effect on a 24 hours a day, seven days a week basis.

283
00:18:44,077 --> 00:18:49,400
As soon as possible, the principal shall prepare written reports surrounding the incident and submit to the superintendent of schools.

284
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:56,463
The school administration will promptly notify parents of situations that may affect the well-being of students, faculty, and staff.

285
00:18:56,963 --> 00:19:04,007
These notifications will be done consistent with applicable law, regulations, and policies of the Medford Public Schools.

286
00:19:05,086 --> 00:19:15,350
Additionally, principals are required to immediately notify the office of the superintendent of schools about other incidents, including but not limited to accidents, fires, and suspension expulsion of students.

287
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:21,892
Written reports concerning the incidents must be submitted to the superintendent no later than the next day following the incident.

288
00:19:23,013 --> 00:19:28,575
The principal or his or her designee must also notify the mayor and members of the school committee as soon as possible.

289
00:19:29,798 --> 00:19:38,743
Finally, upon disposition of the investigation, Superintendent, in conjunction with the Police Department, will provide an appropriate written report to the Mayor, School Committee, and Principal.

290
00:19:39,324 --> 00:19:46,588
This report shall include the facts surrounding the situation, conclusions reached, as well as any recommendations to be considered.

291
00:19:47,706 --> 00:19:49,667
Mr. Russo, I believe you had an amendment to that?

292
00:19:49,967 --> 00:20:00,353
Yes, I would like to add to the policy a statement that this will be integrated into all annual reviews, contracts for rentals of school facilities, and the student handbooks.

293
00:20:04,334 --> 00:20:05,314
Motion of approval.

294
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:07,255
There's a motion on the floor as amended.

295
00:20:07,576 --> 00:20:08,256
Is there a second?

296
00:20:08,716 --> 00:20:08,916
Yes.

297
00:20:09,116 --> 00:20:09,756
Second by Ms.

298
00:20:09,797 --> 00:20:10,357
Mustone.

299
00:20:10,937 --> 00:20:12,398
Roll call vote please on this policy.

300
00:20:12,638 --> 00:20:14,199
Mr. Benedetto.

301
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:14,619
Yes.

302
00:20:15,459 --> 00:20:15,919
Mrs. Kretsch.

303
00:20:15,939 --> 00:20:16,119
Yes.

304
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,260
Mrs. Mustone.

305
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:17,540
Yes.

306
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:18,861
Mr. Ruggiero.

307
00:20:19,021 --> 00:20:19,221
Yes.

308
00:20:19,701 --> 00:20:20,321
Mr. Russo.

309
00:20:20,501 --> 00:20:20,701
Yes.

310
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:22,062
Mrs. Van de Koop.

311
00:20:22,102 --> 00:20:22,302
Yes.

312
00:20:22,862 --> 00:20:23,263
Mayor Burke.

313
00:20:23,563 --> 00:20:24,303
Yes.

314
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:25,764
7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative.

315
00:20:25,784 --> 00:20:27,645
The motion passes, policy adopted.

316
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:30,526
And finally, I just want to say that

317
00:20:31,989 --> 00:20:33,910
We did not take this decision lightly.

318
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:38,373
We considered all different perspectives on this matter.

319
00:20:39,553 --> 00:20:45,817
We also considered the multiple years of service that this superintendent has provided to this community.

320
00:20:46,437 --> 00:20:48,718
He has been a leader in our educational community.

321
00:20:49,199 --> 00:20:51,260
He has built new schools for this community.

322
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:55,122
He has enhanced so many opportunities in our school system.

323
00:20:55,422 --> 00:20:57,163
We do not take those things lightly.

324
00:20:57,723 --> 00:21:02,887
And he has always been a stalwart in everything that has been good about our system and will continue to be.

325
00:21:04,027 --> 00:21:04,748
We have a lot.

326
00:21:36,344 --> 00:21:39,507
We have a lot of important matters that are before us.

327
00:21:39,988 --> 00:21:43,651
We have a transition that we've already announced for our new superintendent.

328
00:21:43,691 --> 00:21:49,918
The search committee has been meeting in the other room all evening, starting the process without the three members of the school committee.

329
00:21:49,978 --> 00:21:52,320
So we are moving forward in that process.

330
00:21:52,761 --> 00:21:54,462
We have contract negotiations.

331
00:21:55,303 --> 00:21:59,487
We have the closeout of the school year, as well as the budget for the subsequent year.

332
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:04,129
We have a lot of things that we have to move forward in this community.

333
00:22:04,769 --> 00:22:12,611
And above and beyond all of that is the safety of our students as well as the teachers and everyone that works in our school system.

334
00:22:13,071 --> 00:22:15,311
That is our top priority to move forward.

335
00:22:15,631 --> 00:22:17,392
And we have to do this as a community.

336
00:22:17,512 --> 00:22:27,194
And I know that there are other members of this body that would like to say a few words because this has probably been one of the most difficult week and a half that I think most of us have had.

337
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:29,636
Is there anyone that would like to?

338
00:22:30,437 --> 00:22:30,577
Ms.

339
00:22:30,617 --> 00:22:31,018
Vandekloot?

340
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:36,944
First, thank you for everybody who's written to us.

341
00:22:37,645 --> 00:22:43,812
No matter what side of the issue you're on, I know that everybody was very upset and that

342
00:22:48,893 --> 00:22:55,658
You can disagree with the superintendent's decision, which many of us did, but you still know he is a good man.

343
00:22:56,279 --> 00:23:09,469
He has served this community well, and it was important as we figured out what we were trying to do or how we would go forward that we needed both a place where we could begin to mend this community,

344
00:23:10,209 --> 00:23:26,794
that we could support our teachers and administrators who serve us every day and we could go forward and also appreciate the fact that the superintendent has served us for 50 years and many of us, you know, really appreciate that.

345
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:29,235
How do you measure a man?

346
00:23:31,116 --> 00:23:34,737
Is it a moment of a decision you disagree with?

347
00:23:36,517 --> 00:23:37,820
Or is it the totality?

348
00:23:38,742 --> 00:23:42,309
As we looked at the decision today, for me, it was the totality.

349
00:23:43,391 --> 00:23:45,235
So that's just what I'd like to say.

350
00:23:45,255 --> 00:23:46,377
Thank you.

351
00:23:53,653 --> 00:23:58,999
So I just wanted to say that this has been the most difficult, like, two weeks.

352
00:23:59,639 --> 00:24:01,681
And I've been struggling every day.

353
00:24:01,701 --> 00:24:04,484
I've been heartbroken, upset, angry.

354
00:24:04,504 --> 00:24:06,866
You know, it was a bad decision.

355
00:24:07,627 --> 00:24:09,549
Superintendent has taken ownership of it.

356
00:24:10,689 --> 00:24:13,911
It's just unfortunate that it happened at this particular time.

357
00:24:14,031 --> 00:24:15,632
I'm glad that nobody was hurt.

358
00:24:16,313 --> 00:24:22,236
And, you know, Superintendent Belson has 50 years of service, 23 years as a superintendent.

359
00:24:23,297 --> 00:24:26,239
It's just incredible everything that he's done for our schools.

360
00:24:26,679 --> 00:24:27,779
And we have to remember that.

361
00:24:27,859 --> 00:24:31,081
We have to remember all the good things that were done here.

362
00:24:31,842 --> 00:24:35,264
There was the one poor judgment, but there's been so many great things.

363
00:24:35,764 --> 00:24:43,954
So it's time for us to get back to work, get back to school, implement the safety procedures and practices, and we need the community's help.

364
00:24:44,334 --> 00:24:45,295
We still need your help.

365
00:24:45,515 --> 00:24:50,581
We want to protect our children, and whatever cost it takes, we're going to make sure that we do that.

366
00:24:50,982 --> 00:24:53,084
So I appreciate all your messages.

367
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:56,208
It will take us some time to get back to all of you.

368
00:24:56,668 --> 00:24:58,248
So please be patient, but we will.

369
00:24:58,869 --> 00:25:12,272
And I just want to thank everybody for your patience, and the police department for doing all the searches, and everybody just stepping up and getting out there and, you know, just giving a good word or some feedback.

370
00:25:12,372 --> 00:25:13,532
It's just been helpful.

371
00:25:13,692 --> 00:25:18,193
And I just want to thank, you know, my colleagues tonight for this session.

372
00:25:18,213 --> 00:25:22,734
And it was very difficult, and I know in my heart that I made the right decision.

373
00:25:23,155 --> 00:25:23,815
Thank you very much.

374
00:25:29,132 --> 00:25:29,915
Mr. Ruggiero.

375
00:25:32,002 --> 00:25:34,391
This week has been challenging for all of us.

376
00:25:36,047 --> 00:25:40,450
I want to thank the hundreds of people that have reached out to me to talk about this issue.

377
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:43,632
If anything, please keep those emails coming.

378
00:25:45,393 --> 00:25:53,879
It would be great now that we have these lines of communications available, that we talk about more constructive things moving forward.

379
00:25:53,899 --> 00:25:58,503
And everyone's opinion here is greatly valued to me, and I thank all the members here at the school committee.

380
00:25:59,203 --> 00:26:00,564
So please keep those messages coming.

381
00:26:01,104 --> 00:26:03,266
If we're going to do this, we're doing this together.

382
00:26:06,004 --> 00:26:06,704
Thank you.

383
00:26:07,825 --> 00:26:08,605
Mr. Benedetto.

384
00:26:10,746 --> 00:26:13,887
Thank you.

385
00:26:14,127 --> 00:26:30,632
So I would just like to remind people that not only our school district, but every school district needs to remember that there is a zero tolerance for weapons in our schools, where we keep our children safe.

386
00:26:31,793 --> 00:26:32,934
Zero tolerance.

387
00:26:33,615 --> 00:26:38,618
And if you see something, please say something.

388
00:26:39,579 --> 00:26:51,308
Learn from our community how important it is to communicate and to move forward and to work together to make sure our students are safe.

389
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:56,792
Again, zero tolerance.

390
00:26:57,953 --> 00:26:59,194
See it and say it.

391
00:27:05,603 --> 00:27:06,204
Mr. Russo.

392
00:27:08,165 --> 00:27:08,525
Thank you.

393
00:27:10,067 --> 00:27:19,474
So this has certainly been as everybody else has indicated and I think everybody here has experienced a week that I hope we don't have to ever have again.

394
00:27:21,596 --> 00:27:23,417
Last Thursday's meeting was

395
00:27:25,609 --> 00:27:28,070
was, I guess it spoke for itself.

396
00:27:30,532 --> 00:27:35,935
And, you know, I've only been on the school committee now for eight weeks, which is, I guess, trial by fire.

397
00:27:38,216 --> 00:27:42,578
You know, I've responded to 250 emails this past week.

398
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:46,820
And what struck me about the emails was

399
00:27:48,627 --> 00:27:53,933
that, without exception, they were the longest emails I've ever received in my life.

400
00:27:54,274 --> 00:27:57,378
I mean, these things were small novels, every one of them.

401
00:27:58,299 --> 00:28:06,889
And they were all very unique and passionate, and many of them were very conflicted, you know.

402
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:11,311
Individuals were not necessarily on one side or the other.

403
00:28:11,871 --> 00:28:22,035
And I think that many of us on the committee have experienced that as well, where it's like, this is not a black and white issue that we've been dealing with.

404
00:28:24,276 --> 00:28:25,636
My children are in our schools.

405
00:28:26,237 --> 00:28:28,977
I felt like they were safe before December 28th or 29th.

406
00:28:30,969 --> 00:28:37,211
I have felt like they've been safe since then, and I felt completely that they were safe when they went back to school.

407
00:28:38,231 --> 00:28:44,512
And I say that knowing as much as any of us know about what has or hasn't happened.

408
00:28:46,053 --> 00:28:53,995
I think it's important to say that I sent my kids to school, and the only thing I was concerned about was, was the media gonna harass any of the kids, which...

409
00:28:55,128 --> 00:28:59,911
I don't think that happened, but I was never concerned for their safety.

410
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:10,977
And that's really the most important message here, is that from a safety perspective, there's no safer place for our kids than actually in school.

411
00:29:12,218 --> 00:29:13,158
Those are just the facts.

412
00:29:13,258 --> 00:29:16,500
They might not feel like the facts, because we all see the news.

413
00:29:19,788 --> 00:29:25,030
None of us are ever going to be as safe as we were or we are as children in our schools.

414
00:29:27,492 --> 00:29:30,333
I have a much longer statement which I'll release tomorrow.

415
00:29:31,814 --> 00:29:36,636
I was going to read it, but I think you all are probably as tired as the rest of us, so thank you.

416
00:29:44,507 --> 00:29:45,207
I will be brief.

417
00:29:45,547 --> 00:30:11,052
I I'm excited that we have an action plan that we can all work on and moving forward Secondly Reverend Wendy and Reverend D came over my house today to talk about an interfaith service about peace in our schools I hope you'll all attend once we get it planned I think it's great for our community to come together for peace and Third is we were gonna have a Guinness in June and now we're gonna have a Guinness in April Mr. Superintendent

418
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:23,437
So I want to begin by apologizing to everyone for any disruption that my actions may have caused.

419
00:30:24,838 --> 00:30:36,891
Obviously, a decision was made that people don't agree with, but it also set off a whole series of concerns in the community, and that never was my intent.

420
00:30:38,417 --> 00:30:42,880
I'm confident that Medford has a bright future for its school system.

421
00:30:43,641 --> 00:30:45,062
We have a lot of good things in place.

422
00:30:45,622 --> 00:30:53,047
We have a terrific faculty, terrific administrators, wonderful supporters, people that have worked hard to partner with our schools.

423
00:30:53,628 --> 00:30:56,570
And I know that we will get a lot done in the next several months.

424
00:30:57,218 --> 00:31:02,460
and that the new administration coming in will come and build on a firm foundation.

425
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:03,560
Mayor's words.

426
00:31:04,401 --> 00:31:17,266
And I think that the reality for all of us is to get beyond, to work to learn from this situation, and to grow together, and to make sure that we do everything we can to protect the children and families of Medford.

427
00:31:17,961 --> 00:31:21,904
Additionally, we will work much more closely with the police department.

428
00:31:21,944 --> 00:31:23,406
We have for many years.

429
00:31:23,986 --> 00:31:28,750
This was an exception, but I have a lot of confidence in our police department and Chief Sacco and others.

430
00:31:29,391 --> 00:31:34,415
And I want to make sure that everyone realizes that we will do everything we can to keep our young people safe.

431
00:31:34,996 --> 00:31:36,297
Thank you for being here tonight.

432
00:31:36,497 --> 00:31:39,579
I appreciate your support and I appreciate your understanding.

433
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,100
Thank you.

434
00:31:59,031 --> 00:31:59,511
Oh, yes.

435
00:32:00,591 --> 00:32:02,192
I just wanted to make a very quick comment.

436
00:32:02,432 --> 00:32:09,836
I had the privilege to stand next to some amazing teachers today at the McGlynn School, and administrators, and staff.

437
00:32:10,736 --> 00:32:14,478
And everyone stood so tall today for the benefit of our children.

438
00:32:14,678 --> 00:32:18,139
And if you just spent a few minutes there, you would have seen it in action.

439
00:32:18,219 --> 00:32:19,860
And they're some amazing people.

440
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,981
And they're not just at our McGlynn School.

441
00:32:22,021 --> 00:32:23,462
They're in all of our schools.

442
00:32:23,922 --> 00:32:25,763
We have a wonderful school community.

443
00:32:26,383 --> 00:32:31,365
They're caring, they're nurturing, and they put their children first, all of our children first.

444
00:32:32,006 --> 00:32:38,669
And so to them and to all of you who are here tonight that represent them, I thank you personally for all of your hard work.

445
00:32:39,029 --> 00:32:41,110
We know this has been difficult for you as well.

446
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:46,332
And we are here to support you and to move this community forward.

447
00:32:46,992 --> 00:32:48,953
And just thank you from the bottom of our hearts.

448
00:32:49,013 --> 00:32:49,574
Thank you all.

449
00:32:49,914 --> 00:32:50,234
Thank you.

450
00:32:53,976 --> 00:32:54,941
Motion to adjourn.

451
00:32:55,001 --> 00:32:55,886
Motion to adjourn.

452
00:32:56,348 --> 00:32:56,750
Thank you.

453
00:32:57,052 --> 00:32:57,373
Thank you.
