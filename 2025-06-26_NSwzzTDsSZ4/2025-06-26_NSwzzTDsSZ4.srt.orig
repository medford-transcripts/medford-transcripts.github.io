33
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:58,022
[SPEAKER_32]: So I've passed the the probationary period so it looks like I'm stuck here.

34
00:03:00,721 --> 00:03:11,984
[SPEAKER_32]: I just wanted to attend tonight's meeting to get a feel for how the, you know, how the board operates and try to become a little bit more in touch with some of the projects that are going on when I get calls all the time.

35
00:03:12,504 --> 00:03:14,344
[SPEAKER_32]: Obviously they're like, oh, so what about this?

36
00:03:14,364 --> 00:03:14,944
[SPEAKER_32]: And what about that?

37
00:03:14,964 --> 00:03:15,785
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm like, what, what?

38
00:03:16,425 --> 00:03:17,945
[SPEAKER_32]: You know, like I'm a little confused.

39
00:03:17,985 --> 00:03:23,026
[SPEAKER_32]: So I thought that I would start attending here regularly just to see what's going on.

40
00:03:23,086 --> 00:03:26,067
[SPEAKER_32]: So thank you very much for your very kind and warm welcome.

53
00:04:13,787 --> 00:04:19,390

54
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:19,890
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

55
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:23,901

00:04:27,364 --> 00:04:30,127
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

58
00:04:31,128 --> 00:04:37,534
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, it was a different date, relative to an application for site plan review and special permits submitted by Keynes restaurants.

59
00:04:38,315 --> 00:04:40,857
[SPEAKER_08]: The applicant is seeking to construct a drive through restaurant.

60
00:04:41,538 --> 00:04:49,601
[SPEAKER_08]: in a commercial one zoning district at 509 to 511 Riverside app, requiring a special permit under our zoning ordinance.

61
00:04:50,621 --> 00:04:56,543
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's also a request for a waiver of off street loading requirements, also a requirement of the zoning ordinance.

62
00:04:58,104 --> 00:05:07,407
[SPEAKER_08]: We will discuss as a board the second interview and special permit recommendations to the city council the city council is actually the special permit granting authority for this matter.

63
00:05:08,207 --> 00:05:10,908
[SPEAKER_08]: So with that, thank you and sorry again for the interruption.

64
00:05:11,502 --> 00:05:13,144
[SPEAKER_31]: No, thank you, Chairman Blumberg.

65
00:05:13,764 --> 00:05:20,831
[SPEAKER_31]: Tonight here with me is the applicant, Adam karate senior property development manager of raising Keynes restaurants LLC.

66

[SPEAKER_31]: Karen Johnson vice president of development with charter realty development.

67
00:05:25,656 --> 00:05:33,684
[SPEAKER_31]: On behalf of the owner of those with us a limited partnership, and the development team project engineer Eric to rule of older engineering.

68
00:05:34,284 --> 00:05:45,316
[SPEAKER_31]: project architect Jeffrey Whitney, a media architects and profit traffic engineer, Patrick Dunford, senior project manager with the HP engineer and consulting.

69
00:05:46,588 --> 00:06:08,437
[SPEAKER_31]: As indicated, the application before you this evening is an application for site plan review in conjunction with an application for special permit to construct a 3,320 square foot eat-in restaurant with a drive-through to be situated within the confines of the outdoor shopping center known as the Felsway Plaza, located at 760 Felsway Medford Mass.

70
00:06:08,857 --> 00:06:12,058
[SPEAKER_31]: I believe that you had, Mr. Chairman, the 509511 address

71
00:06:13,779 --> 00:06:18,583
[SPEAKER_31]: I believe that would be the proposed address in the event that the project were permitted.

72
00:06:18,603 --> 00:06:34,274
[SPEAKER_31]: All of the sites with buildings within that 760 Felsway property have different addresses, so that they're identified differently, but the property is 760 Felsway as it currently stands.

73
00:06:34,454 --> 00:06:35,635
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for the clarification.

74
00:06:35,655 --> 00:06:36,456
[SPEAKER_08]: We appreciate that.

75
00:06:37,825 --> 00:06:46,107
[SPEAKER_31]: By way of background, those who might be unfamiliar with the site, the Felsway Plaza is comprised of three separate parcels of land, each owned by separate entities.

76
00:06:46,628 --> 00:06:55,510
[SPEAKER_31]: The subject site, owned by Felsway Limited Partnership, contains a total land area of approximately 670,378 square feet.

77
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:59,831
[SPEAKER_31]: At present, there are three buildings situated on the subject site.

78
00:07:00,572 --> 00:07:05,573
[SPEAKER_31]: One, a building that houses approximately 13 commercial units occupied by a mix of retail

79
00:07:06,053 --> 00:07:18,304
[SPEAKER_31]: restaurants, fitness and medical uses, and it going from left to right, bio life would be the building on on your left side of the site of that 13 units and Carter.

80
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:26,051
[SPEAKER_31]: Carter's is the, the building adjacent to the second building on the site which is a stop and shop.

81
00:07:27,619 --> 00:07:28,300
[SPEAKER_31]: supermarkets.

82
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:32,165
[SPEAKER_31]: In addition to those two buildings on the southerly portion of the site.

83
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:40,837
[SPEAKER_31]: There is currently a freestanding building with approximately 2800 square feet occupied by Eastern Bank, that includes a drive up service window.

84
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:54,694
[SPEAKER_31]: As proposed, raising Keynes restaurant site will consist of a least area situated within the north northerly portion of the property, consisting of approximately 31,491 square feet of land, and in proximity to the current location of Eastern Bank.

85
00:07:58,896 --> 00:08:14,073
[SPEAKER_31]: The proposed site for racing canes as you indicated is located within a C one district that requires a special permit for the establishment and we need in restaurant with a drive through from city council pursuant to table a table of uses and parking regulations item g two of the ordinance.

86
00:08:14,814 --> 00:08:17,436
[SPEAKER_31]: In addition to the special permit for construction of the restaurant.

87
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:32,607
[SPEAKER_31]: The applicant is also requesting a waiver of loading requirements in accordance with section 6.1 point three of the ordinance, which appears to suggest that the restaurant, based on its gross leasable floor area may be exempt, or alternatively a special permit pursuant to 6.1 point 10 of the ordinance.

88
00:08:34,008 --> 00:08:37,032
[SPEAKER_31]: to reduce or waive the requirement of a dedicated loading space.

89
00:08:37,652 --> 00:08:51,588
[SPEAKER_31]: And then lastly, the applicant is requesting two waivers relating to site plan review and the plan submitted, the first having to do with the necessity of including contour line elevations, and the second having to do with the required elevations for existing buildings on the site.

90
00:08:52,029 --> 00:08:53,731
[SPEAKER_31]: And these were submitted with the application.

91
00:08:55,022 --> 00:09:08,476
[SPEAKER_31]: With that, I'll turn the presentation over to Adam Karachi, and he can explain to you a little bit about the operation of Raising Cane's Restaurants, LLC, and then the rest of the development team can go through the site plan with you.

92
00:09:09,857 --> 00:09:10,078
[SPEAKER_31]: Adam.

93
00:09:11,319 --> 00:09:12,060
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Kathleen.

94
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,123
[SPEAKER_20]: I do have a presentation if I could share my screen.

95
00:09:25,411 --> 00:09:35,275
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

96
00:09:35,295 --> 00:09:36,075
[SPEAKER_20]: Good evening, everyone.

97
00:09:36,095 --> 00:09:38,396
[SPEAKER_05]: As Kathleen said, my name is Adam Karachi.

98
00:09:38,436 --> 00:09:43,918
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm the senior property development manager for Raising Canes for the East Coast.

99
00:09:44,999 --> 00:09:46,339
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is our

100
00:09:49,056 --> 00:09:51,679
[SPEAKER_05]: fifth location that we're doing in Massachusetts.

101
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:57,264
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll just give a brief introduction on who Raising Cane's is.

102
00:09:57,384 --> 00:10:04,371
[SPEAKER_05]: We were founded in 1996 outside the north gates of LSU with our first restaurant opened by Todd Graves.

103
00:10:05,448 --> 00:10:08,831
[SPEAKER_05]: He started it as a small business, ran it as a small business for many years.

104
00:10:09,431 --> 00:10:12,414
[SPEAKER_05]: Then around 2002, 2003, we started to expand.

105
00:10:13,815 --> 00:10:17,938
[SPEAKER_05]: We do one thing, we call it our one love, and that's the quality chicken finger meal.

106
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:24,543
[SPEAKER_05]: Unlike some of the other competitors in the market, we don't have a lot of different items on our menu.

107
00:10:24,623 --> 00:10:32,890
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is very important when we discuss later operations and how we differentiate ourselves from others in the industry.

108
00:10:33,592 --> 00:10:35,534
[SPEAKER_05]: We currently have over 700 locations.

109
00:10:35,815 --> 00:10:39,279
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a location at Boston University that opened in 2009.

110
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:45,307
[SPEAKER_05]: And there is a location that opened today in Back Bay neighborhood at 755 Boylston Street.

111
00:10:45,867 --> 00:10:51,535
[SPEAKER_05]: We have Marlboro opening on May 17th and Methuen opening in August this year.

112
00:10:52,509 --> 00:10:56,453
[SPEAKER_05]: So there are some existing restaurants for you to visit and get an idea of who we are.

113
00:10:57,834 --> 00:11:08,385
[SPEAKER_05]: We pride ourselves on our active community involvement, so every restaurant will have a dedicated marketing manager who is plugged into your community that will

114
00:11:09,673 --> 00:11:22,919
[SPEAKER_05]: actively seek to provide back to your community with feeding the hungry, entrepreneurship, active lifestyles, pet welfare, and education being the primary focuses, and then anything else that is proposed to us, we obviously entertain.

115
00:11:24,749 --> 00:11:30,770
[SPEAKER_05]: Raising canes was named after Todd Graves, the founder's yellow lap cane.

116
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:37,311
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you'll see a lot of that throughout the presentation referenced back.

117
00:11:37,711 --> 00:11:42,152
[SPEAKER_05]: And that also lends to one of our core values being pet welfare.

118
00:11:46,813 --> 00:11:50,374
[SPEAKER_05]: So Kathleen went through the description of the application requests.

119
00:11:50,474 --> 00:11:52,154
[SPEAKER_05]: I will not repeat that.

120
00:11:53,178 --> 00:11:56,801
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the site plan that Kathleen discussed.

121
00:11:56,981 --> 00:12:03,125
[SPEAKER_05]: There's the three parcels here, the adjacent Eastern Bank to the left of our proposed site.

122
00:12:04,206 --> 00:12:12,332
[SPEAKER_05]: This area roughly following my cursor being the lot that we're discussing this evening, 760 Fellsway.

123
00:12:12,352 --> 00:12:15,894
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a zoomed in version of our site plan.

124
00:12:15,914 --> 00:12:22,059
[SPEAKER_05]: Kathleen, do you want me to get much into the site plan right now or just talk about the operations of the drive-through?

125
00:12:22,905 --> 00:12:23,866
[SPEAKER_05]: Or do you want to wait on that.

126
00:12:24,407 --> 00:12:32,058
[SPEAKER_31]: Eric is probably whether it's Erica you you can go through the site if you like first or if you prefer to do operations it's up to you, Adam.

127
00:12:32,258 --> 00:12:35,923
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, let's, let's talk about the site first I think that's better so that they understand.

128
00:12:39,986 --> 00:12:41,487
[SPEAKER_05]: how that integrates with the operations.

129
00:12:42,087 --> 00:12:49,631
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're proposing roughly 3,300 square foot building, as Kathleen mentioned, with a dual drive-through.

130
00:12:49,831 --> 00:13:00,237
[SPEAKER_05]: And so what you see here are two drive-through lanes that goes under a canopy and then proceed around the building to another canopy.

131
00:13:00,257 --> 00:13:01,898
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm actually got a zoomed in version.

132
00:13:02,659 --> 00:13:08,122
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Eastern Bank, just to give you context, Riverside Avenue at the intersection of Route 28 and Riverside.

133
00:13:11,602 --> 00:13:21,668
[SPEAKER_05]: So during COVID, it became very obvious that operations of drive-thru restaurants needed to adapt to remain viable.

134
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:28,592
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we started implementing dual drive-thru lanes, and what we found is that they made our business more efficient.

135
00:13:29,212 --> 00:13:33,354
[SPEAKER_05]: As I mentioned earlier, we have one item on the menu, that's the chicken finger.

136
00:13:33,815 --> 00:13:37,577
[SPEAKER_05]: It comes with crinkle cut fries, Texas toast, coleslaw, and our sauce.

137
00:13:38,457 --> 00:13:39,718
[SPEAKER_05]: There's not a lot of variety.

138
00:13:40,178 --> 00:13:46,323
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can order three tenders, four tenders, six tenders, and that's really the only customization that's available.

139
00:13:47,464 --> 00:13:49,226
[SPEAKER_05]: There aren't other items on the menu.

140
00:13:49,266 --> 00:13:50,007
[SPEAKER_05]: There are no shakes.

141
00:13:50,047 --> 00:13:50,887
[SPEAKER_05]: There are no salads.

142
00:13:50,968 --> 00:13:52,589
[SPEAKER_05]: There are no burgers.

143
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:54,651
[SPEAKER_05]: It's chicken fingers.

144
00:13:54,971 --> 00:13:56,733
[SPEAKER_05]: You can get a chicken finger sandwich, but

145
00:13:57,718 --> 00:14:11,904
[SPEAKER_05]: What that essentially does is it allows the customer to know their order and to get it out pretty quickly and allows us to have a two and a half minute service time from the time the customer places the order to when they're getting their food and leaving.

146
00:14:12,925 --> 00:14:17,667
[SPEAKER_05]: We've designed this drive-through to stack, leave its 20 cars, but Pat can speak to that later.

147
00:14:19,027 --> 00:14:26,991
[SPEAKER_05]: And we recently studied similar locations that have opened in the Philadelphia metro area that would basically

148
00:14:28,773 --> 00:14:30,856
[SPEAKER_05]: corroborate that this is sufficiently stacked.

149
00:14:31,857 --> 00:14:40,489
[SPEAKER_05]: So there are two types of operations that we would discuss typically.

150
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:42,993
[SPEAKER_05]: There's peak and off-peak operations.

151
00:14:44,034 --> 00:14:44,194
[SPEAKER_05]: We

152
00:14:46,238 --> 00:14:47,620
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll start with with offbeat.

153
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,882
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's basically your mid afternoon and your late night.

154
00:14:49,942 --> 00:14:51,985
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where the drive through is going to function.

155
00:14:52,005 --> 00:14:56,831
[SPEAKER_05]: As a traditional drive through, and so you'll have 2 lanes that come in.

156
00:14:56,911 --> 00:15:00,255
[SPEAKER_05]: They've each got their own menu board, and then they merge.

157
00:15:01,017 --> 00:15:06,843
[SPEAKER_05]: just hard to see what this line means, into one lane and they go through the traditional pay and then pickup window.

158
00:15:08,485 --> 00:15:13,851
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to be, again, off-peak, you're talking two or three cars in the drive-through.

159
00:15:14,512 --> 00:15:21,620
[SPEAKER_05]: Peak, which is lunch and dinner rush, so 11 to 1 and then 5 to 7 respectively,

160
00:15:22,773 --> 00:15:32,404
[SPEAKER_05]: We turn off the menu boards we don't use the pay the pickup window we have crew members station strategically out in the drive through and that's what these hatched crosswalks are for.

161
00:15:33,305 --> 00:15:39,993
[SPEAKER_05]: And they usher course forward, they take orders, they take payment via tablets they can they can do cash.

162
00:15:40,858 --> 00:15:45,562
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they make sure that people are moving quickly and efficiently through the line.

163
00:15:46,002 --> 00:15:52,787
[SPEAKER_05]: They walk in these hatched crosswalks or in sidewalks along the edge here of the pavement.

164
00:15:53,467 --> 00:16:01,634
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the food is brought to the outboard lane via crew member and under this covered canopy.

165
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:09,838
[SPEAKER_05]: The crew members do have area of refuge during the hot and colder months under this canopy that's over the menu boards.

166
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:14,320
[SPEAKER_05]: They're heated and they have fans and misters for the summer.

167
00:16:16,081 --> 00:16:29,928
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a little bit different than what you're probably accustomed to seeing in drive-throughs, and I wanted to get that out of the way and explain that because it really does affect the design and the implementation of the site.

168
00:16:30,957 --> 00:16:38,965
[SPEAKER_05]: I will say that we did receive some feedback regarding the site plan and I hope you'll be pleased that we've incorporated it later on in the presentation.

169
00:16:38,985 --> 00:16:45,271
[SPEAKER_05]: This is some typical landscaping that we would provide.

170
00:16:45,411 --> 00:16:49,635
[SPEAKER_05]: I did want to show you that the site via a color site plan is going to have

171
00:16:50,673 --> 00:16:57,480
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of landscaping typically we would spend about $200,000 on landscaping package for a site of the size.

172
00:16:58,621 --> 00:17:05,648
[SPEAKER_05]: So, a lot of trees, a lot of ground cover and we use quality plant materials, we are looking for.

173
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,042
[SPEAKER_05]: vivid color in all seasons.

174
00:17:09,323 --> 00:17:17,493
[SPEAKER_05]: So you'll notice some snow, we've got some red berries here, and we've got different types of plants that produce different types.

175
00:17:17,513 --> 00:17:24,442
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not a landscape architect, but we have different types of plants that provide a visually appealing landscape palette year-round.

176
00:17:26,554 --> 00:17:30,978
[SPEAKER_05]: I know there were some concerns about turning movements to the site plan, so I briefly wanted to touch on that.

177
00:17:30,998 --> 00:17:48,315
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the exhibit for a large SUV, showing that this is a Ford Explorer in this case, is able to make the turn and to the drive through without running any curbs or anything like that and leave the site.

178
00:17:49,712 --> 00:18:01,199
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the fire truck apparatus making its way through the site, and that was done per the spec of City of Medford fire apparatus.

179
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:11,166
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the delivery truck coming in, and then sort of coming in this way from the site access circulating through the site.

180
00:18:12,653 --> 00:18:20,440
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a small loading zone that is provided circulating through around Eastern Bank and then back out of the site.

181
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:24,763
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a WB40, so it's a smaller delivery vehicle.

182
00:18:24,863 --> 00:18:33,551
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not the standard delivery vehicle that you would see go to a supermarket or even like a Domino's uses a larger delivery truck.

183
00:18:33,691 --> 00:18:35,873
[SPEAKER_05]: This is smaller and more appropriate for the site.

184
00:18:38,057 --> 00:18:45,339
[SPEAKER_05]: With that, that kind of brings me to the more technical aspects of the site, the stormwater, the grading, and the utilities.

185
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:52,861
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would prefer to yield that over to Eric Dubrul with Bowler to discuss further.

186
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:54,801
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Adam.

187
00:18:54,821 --> 00:18:58,482
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, again, for the record, Eric Dubrul with Bowler Engineering, site civil.

188
00:18:58,502 --> 00:19:01,123
[SPEAKER_18]: Can I just jump in for a second?

189
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:05,119
[SPEAKER_18]: It seems like there's a lot of white space outside of these drawings.

190
00:19:05,159 --> 00:19:07,260
[SPEAKER_18]: Can you zoom in a little bit so we can see it better?

191
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,320
[SPEAKER_18]: It's kind of hard to see.

192
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:09,200
[SPEAKER_18]: Sure.

193
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:11,821
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me see if I can make that happen.

194
00:19:12,282 --> 00:19:15,683
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm operating off of SharePoint at the moment.

195
00:19:16,743 --> 00:19:17,864
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe the bottom right.

196
00:19:17,904 --> 00:19:18,164
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

197
00:19:21,729 --> 00:19:33,439
[SPEAKER_09]: But there, and would you mind going back to the zoomed in render plan I just want to hit a couple highlights on the site plan that might be worth hitting before we move on to the boring utilities and stormwater.

198
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:42,247
[SPEAKER_09]: So Adam did an awesome job covering most of most I was going to go through I just want to touch on a couple of items.

199
00:19:43,498 --> 00:20:01,879
[SPEAKER_09]: made a strong focus on pedestrian connectivity for this project, you'll note we've towards the north we've, we've broken through there's an existing fence that runs along Riverside, so we've broken through that fence added a, an accessible connection sidewalk connection through to the front door of the property.

200
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:11,543
[SPEAKER_09]: And then as well as on the middle Sex Fellsway Parkway driveway, we've run a sidewalk all the way around the perimeter of the site.

201
00:20:11,563 --> 00:20:18,005
[SPEAKER_09]: So you essentially have 270 degrees of pedestrian connectivity on this site, all accessible.

202
00:20:19,706 --> 00:20:26,728
[SPEAKER_09]: We've also provided a bike rack at the, I guess, top left corner on the patio for a bike facility there.

203
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:30,876
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that was a highlight.

204
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:32,937
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to make sure we touched on that briefly.

205
00:20:34,198 --> 00:20:53,370
[SPEAKER_09]: Relative to the landscaping, just to provide a little bit more detail, I don't want to go into some great detail, but effectively over 400 new plantings on the site and giving back 390 square feet or so of additional green space, which is always obviously a nice benefit to have when you have a redevelopment project.

206
00:20:55,753 --> 00:20:58,496
[SPEAKER_09]: And now we can talk some utilities and stormwater.

207
00:20:59,857 --> 00:21:06,503
[SPEAKER_09]: For the most part, water, gas, electric, sewer, they'll be all new services coming from Riverside.

208
00:21:06,523 --> 00:21:09,146
[SPEAKER_09]: So all new proposed services.

209
00:21:09,786 --> 00:21:16,453
[SPEAKER_09]: The stormwater under existing conditions, the existing parking lot is all paved parking.

210
00:21:16,973 --> 00:21:20,276
[SPEAKER_09]: It sheet flows to an existing catch basin at the bottom left.

211
00:21:21,275 --> 00:21:33,781
[SPEAKER_09]: We're proposing to capture the stormwater now through deep-sump hooded catch basins before routing it through a stormwater quality unit to get the needed treatment before outletting to the existing connection within the plaza.

212
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:46,268
[SPEAKER_09]: And I guess bringing me to my final point, we've discussed with various departments through some of the staff comment letters that are available, specifically for DPW and engineering.

213
00:21:46,288 --> 00:21:49,009
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of those comments revolved around

214
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:51,111
[SPEAKER_09]: utilities and stormwater.

215
00:21:51,552 --> 00:21:57,736
[SPEAKER_09]: So we spoke with them and we've come to a resolution for all of their comments at this point.

216
00:21:58,677 --> 00:22:06,262
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we'll be adding some additional stormwater quality with some Philterra tree box filters, if you will, in the next round of revisions.

217
00:22:07,623 --> 00:22:13,465
[SPEAKER_09]: But we have not revised or formally revised plans in response to those comments.

218
00:22:13,485 --> 00:22:17,906
[SPEAKER_09]: We wanted to come before the board, collect any of your additional comments, and make one final round.

219
00:22:17,926 --> 00:22:28,770
[SPEAKER_09]: But we are confident, through the DEI staff comment letter, engineering, health, and fire, that we'll be able to resolve 100% of their comments in the next round of revisions.

220
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:33,931
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think with that, Adam, I will yield back to you to talk architecture.

221
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:36,352
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.

222
00:22:38,368 --> 00:22:41,331
[SPEAKER_05]: These are the proposed elevations that were submitted with the application.

223
00:22:41,351 --> 00:22:52,844
[SPEAKER_05]: They use a variety of materials, there's different textures and rhythms to the building to provide a visually appealing structure.

224
00:22:54,606 --> 00:22:56,187
[SPEAKER_05]: These are the 2D color elevations.

225
00:22:56,207 --> 00:22:58,388
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the palette of materials.

226
00:22:58,428 --> 00:23:00,129
[SPEAKER_05]: So you'll see there's some perforated metal.

227
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:04,652
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some Nichiha panels to provide.

228
00:23:05,232 --> 00:23:12,436
[SPEAKER_05]: These are faux wood for practical reasons, but they provide a wood texture to the building.

229
00:23:13,257 --> 00:23:23,883
[SPEAKER_05]: Two types of brick, aluminum storefront, a recycled car hood material for one element of the building, which is this one tower here.

230
00:23:25,627 --> 00:23:34,511
[SPEAKER_06]: And then Galvalume siding, which is on the dumpster enclosure here.

231
00:23:34,931 --> 00:23:44,696
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've got some photos, so I just want to point this out, because you'll see in the other photo they don't have that, and that's really the only thing that's different.

232
00:23:46,208 --> 00:23:51,149
[SPEAKER_05]: This is an example of a restaurant that recently opened in Houston, Texas.

233
00:23:51,389 --> 00:23:54,390
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the same prototype that we're proposing here.

234
00:23:54,410 --> 00:24:00,171
[SPEAKER_05]: So you'll see there's the brick, there's the recycled car hood material, a similar patio.

235
00:24:00,231 --> 00:24:05,973
[SPEAKER_05]: All patios are custom to the site to fit the site dimensions for the restaurant.

236
00:24:06,553 --> 00:24:11,894
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you can see this is the canopy over here that's over the drive-through pickup window where the orders are brought out.

237
00:24:12,354 --> 00:24:18,097
[SPEAKER_05]: I do apologize for the 360 and pedestrians was taken from a Matterport survey.

238
00:24:20,338 --> 00:24:29,923
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the drive-through facade and the canopy that I was just talking about over the pickup window and a different view of the patio, some umbrella seating.

239
00:24:30,083 --> 00:24:34,806
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, this would be different for your site to fit the site dimensions.

240
00:24:36,586 --> 00:24:39,308
[SPEAKER_06]: The patio facade wraps around the building.

241
00:24:42,661 --> 00:24:43,782
[SPEAKER_06]: and then the rear facade.

242
00:24:43,802 --> 00:24:48,566
[SPEAKER_05]: So the gavel in that I was talking about earlier would wrap and enclose this walk-in cooler.

243
00:24:48,606 --> 00:24:51,269
[SPEAKER_05]: So it wouldn't be the raw walk-in cooler appearance here.

244
00:24:51,909 --> 00:24:54,111
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are the Nichiha panels around the corral.

245
00:24:54,131 --> 00:24:57,134
[SPEAKER_05]: This is basically a service area off the back of the building.

246
00:24:57,214 --> 00:25:02,198
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where any sort of carts or anything like that would be stored.

247
00:25:02,218 --> 00:25:04,120
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're out of view and not unsightly.

248
00:25:05,507 --> 00:25:07,967
[SPEAKER_05]: And then this is the trash enclosure.

249
00:25:08,168 --> 00:25:10,728
[SPEAKER_05]: We may be proposing a different enclosure here.

250
00:25:10,768 --> 00:25:12,428
[SPEAKER_05]: I can let Jeff speak to that.

251
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:13,348
[SPEAKER_05]: He's our architect.

252
00:25:14,349 --> 00:25:15,769
[SPEAKER_05]: I know for sure it's not covered.

253
00:25:15,829 --> 00:25:17,789
[SPEAKER_05]: This was a local requirement in Houston.

254
00:25:18,229 --> 00:25:21,090
[SPEAKER_05]: And then this is the canopy over the drive-thru that I was talking about earlier.

255
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:23,310
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Houston, so they only have fans and misters.

256
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:25,931
[SPEAKER_05]: Yours would have heaters on it.

257
00:25:27,311 --> 00:25:31,872
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the drive-thru menu boards that are used during off-peak hours.

258
00:25:33,651 --> 00:25:35,652
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is a quick shot of the interior.

259
00:25:36,753 --> 00:25:38,494
[SPEAKER_05]: Just thought that would be interesting to share with you.

260
00:25:38,514 --> 00:25:43,858
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it's not particularly germane, but the variety of materials carries into the building.

261
00:25:43,878 --> 00:25:47,661
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a very industrial feel inside.

262
00:25:48,581 --> 00:25:59,629
[SPEAKER_05]: All of the artwork that is on the wall, with the exception of a few things that are prototypical, like the E, the Raising Cane's logo, and the Raising Cane portrait here, are custom for

263
00:26:00,409 --> 00:26:01,630
[SPEAKER_05]: your city.

264
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:12,756
[SPEAKER_05]: And so there are often things that are found on eBay or yard sales that are memorabilia from your location that are then framed and hung inside of the restaurant.

265
00:26:12,816 --> 00:26:22,862
[SPEAKER_05]: Often that has to do with colleges or high schools or unique experiences or just cultural things that have to do with Medford.

266
00:26:25,704 --> 00:26:27,185
[SPEAKER_20]: Jeff, would you like to add anything?

267
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:30,262
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, thanks Adam.

268
00:26:31,142 --> 00:26:38,729
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, just mentioning that at this location, the dumpster enclosure would be a split face CMU, more structurally sound.

269
00:26:39,009 --> 00:26:41,231
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, it would not have a roof at this location.

270
00:26:41,732 --> 00:26:46,676
[SPEAKER_13]: But again, it would be a masonry appearance, full through CMU.

271
00:26:47,977 --> 00:26:54,519
[SPEAKER_13]: with gates, the fronts, metal gates painted, so everything is enclosed within the enclosure, so you don't see anything.

272
00:26:55,439 --> 00:27:00,481
[SPEAKER_13]: To keep the environment clean, we like to keep the area completely clean of any debris and everything.

273
00:27:00,501 --> 00:27:04,522
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just a better environment for the crew and the customers.

274
00:27:06,283 --> 00:27:06,683
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Jeff.

275
00:27:09,552 --> 00:27:13,554
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it as far as the building goes, you can see my next topic.

276
00:27:14,154 --> 00:27:21,257
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll let Pat with VHB speak to that, but before I would defer back to Kathleen.

277
00:27:21,277 --> 00:27:36,803
[SPEAKER_30]: So moving on to traffic at this point, Pat, would you like to discuss the traffic signs and where we are in terms of

278
00:27:40,108 --> 00:27:43,071
[SPEAKER_20]: I think there's something wrong with your sound or having trouble hearing you.

279
00:27:43,091 --> 00:27:49,015
[SPEAKER_20]: Is that better?

280
00:27:49,796 --> 00:27:50,036
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

281
00:27:50,196 --> 00:27:51,898
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah.

282
00:27:52,238 --> 00:27:58,923
[SPEAKER_30]: Pat, would you like to move to the traffic portion of the of the presentation?

283
00:27:59,604 --> 00:28:00,845
[SPEAKER_33]: Yes, absolutely.

284
00:28:01,426 --> 00:28:01,786
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you.

285
00:28:02,506 --> 00:28:03,507
[SPEAKER_33]: And first off, good evening.

286
00:28:03,647 --> 00:28:04,908
[SPEAKER_33]: My name is Patrick Dunford.

287
00:28:05,189 --> 00:28:06,750
[SPEAKER_33]: I'm a transportation engineer.

288
00:28:07,402 --> 00:28:14,747
[SPEAKER_33]: with VHB, we've been working with Raising Canes and the site to come up with a workable traffic solution, which I believe we've done.

289
00:28:15,728 --> 00:28:21,872
[SPEAKER_33]: If I could ask, I think it was Adam, you had some nice visuals up on the screen a second ago, if those could possibly be called back up.

290
00:28:22,773 --> 00:28:22,993
[SPEAKER_20]: Sure.

291
00:28:27,476 --> 00:28:29,838
[SPEAKER_20]: I know you had your presentation, so I don't know if you wanted to drive it.

292
00:28:31,259 --> 00:28:35,402
[SPEAKER_33]: Actually, if you don't mind doing the Vanna White thing for me, it would be greatly appreciated.

293
00:28:36,032 --> 00:28:37,312
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you want me to pull up your presentation?

294
00:28:38,173 --> 00:28:42,054
[SPEAKER_33]: Um, yeah, actually I thought it was embedded in this, but if not, if you have it, that'd be handy.

295
00:28:42,614 --> 00:28:44,035
[SPEAKER_33]: I can certainly call it up if you don't.

296
00:28:44,535 --> 00:28:44,835
[SPEAKER_20]: I got it.

297
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:46,856
[SPEAKER_20]: Sorry about the confusion folks.

298
00:28:55,059 --> 00:28:55,319
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

299
00:28:55,928 --> 00:28:57,870
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you and sorry for that initial delay.

300
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:11,200
[SPEAKER_33]: So what I'd like to do is walk you through the traffic study that we had prepared and submitted, as well as some ongoing site planning that we're coordinating with Adam and with Bowler Engineering.

301
00:29:11,801 --> 00:29:23,991
[SPEAKER_33]: Before we get down to that level of the site as shown here, I would like to kind of zoom out and just show a little bit more of a global view on the next slide, which is typically what we do for traffic work.

302
00:29:25,161 --> 00:29:27,385
[SPEAKER_33]: I think we had shown a site plan earlier.

303
00:29:27,445 --> 00:29:32,415
[SPEAKER_33]: This is just an aerial little star where we hope to have the raising canes going.

304
00:29:32,735 --> 00:29:33,417
[SPEAKER_33]: If you could jump back.

305
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:35,741
[SPEAKER_33]: There we go.

306
00:29:37,378 --> 00:29:39,719
[SPEAKER_33]: And, you know, the stop and shop is in the bottom of the screen.

307
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:42,440
[SPEAKER_33]: Ocean state job lot is in the far left.

308
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:48,602
[SPEAKER_33]: And, uh, you know, we, as a group have been working on this plaza over this over several years.

309
00:29:48,662 --> 00:29:50,242
[SPEAKER_33]: So we've become pretty familiar with it.

310
00:29:50,262 --> 00:30:03,227
[SPEAKER_33]: A lot of, uh, interesting things going on and you can see with the darker pavement up on route 28 at Riverside, uh, DCR is in the process of wrapping up some intersection and sidewalk work in that vicinity.

311
00:30:03,986 --> 00:30:05,688
[SPEAKER_33]: which I can talk about momentarily.

312
00:30:05,708 --> 00:30:23,862
[SPEAKER_33]: The traffic study that we did was submitted this past January, and that actually was based on traffic counts that we had done the prior year, and we made sure those had the appropriate adjustments to make sure we're truly getting an understanding of what's going on in the area.

313
00:30:23,882 --> 00:30:33,330
[SPEAKER_33]: Now, we had started focusing just on the area that I had in the prior screen, and we had done our traffic counts at those locations circled in red.

314
00:30:34,092 --> 00:30:37,013
[SPEAKER_33]: And those are the ones obviously with the proximity to the site.

315
00:30:37,053 --> 00:30:40,074
[SPEAKER_33]: That's where the bulk of the customers would be coming in and coming out.

316
00:30:41,135 --> 00:30:47,777
[SPEAKER_33]: We've had a series of discussions and exchange of information with cities, mobility and planning staff.

317
00:30:48,217 --> 00:30:55,480
[SPEAKER_33]: And through those discussions, we were asked to expand the study area and take a look at some additional locations, which I've highlighted in blue.

318
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:59,341
[SPEAKER_33]: Those are a few areas further West on Riverside.

319
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:07,657
[SPEAKER_33]: Route 16, we even looked at Wellington Circle as well as another intersection about a half mile off the top of the screen.

320
00:31:08,898 --> 00:31:14,523
[SPEAKER_33]: Certainly from all of you driving through these areas, there's lots of stuff going on at those locations.

321
00:31:15,364 --> 00:31:24,213
[SPEAKER_33]: I will tell you once we took a look at the projected traffic for raising canes and the fact that that is predominantly pass-by oriented,

322
00:31:24,946 --> 00:31:32,968
[SPEAKER_33]: Um, which are basically people driving, stopping in on the way to another trip, either on the way home from work or doing business during their lunch hour.

323
00:31:34,088 --> 00:31:41,590
[SPEAKER_33]: These projects tend to generate a good amount of traffic at the site itself, but downstream that traffic tends to already be on the roads.

324
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:46,111
[SPEAKER_33]: And now these people have that option to pull in and grab some food while they're in the area.

325
00:31:46,774 --> 00:31:53,240
[SPEAKER_33]: So we weren't finding a major impact at these locations further up and down on the screen.

326
00:31:54,141 --> 00:31:59,866
[SPEAKER_33]: When we do these types of evaluations as well, it's not just the initial traffic counting.

327
00:32:00,546 --> 00:32:03,469
[SPEAKER_33]: I personally went out here several times on an ongoing basis.

328
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,782
[SPEAKER_33]: just to make sure I was actually seeing what's happening on the ground.

329
00:32:08,103 --> 00:32:11,746
[SPEAKER_33]: Once we do that, we project about seven years forward into the future.

330
00:32:11,986 --> 00:32:13,567
[SPEAKER_33]: We want this to work today.

331
00:32:13,627 --> 00:32:14,988
[SPEAKER_33]: We want it to work long-term.

332
00:32:15,609 --> 00:32:21,874
[SPEAKER_33]: So we had to account for all the various other development projects going on in the area, which we did in our study.

333
00:32:23,175 --> 00:32:27,098
[SPEAKER_33]: So in doing that, we have a good understanding of what this is going to look like in the future.

334
00:32:27,118 --> 00:32:29,800
[SPEAKER_33]: And when a raising canes is added,

335
00:32:30,675 --> 00:32:34,457
[SPEAKER_33]: The critical part obviously is estimating how much traffic it's gonna generate.

336
00:32:35,277 --> 00:32:36,898
[SPEAKER_33]: There's a couple of different ways of doing this.

337
00:32:37,598 --> 00:32:45,001
[SPEAKER_33]: One of them, I imagine this board has heard of in the past, is using information from the Institute of Transportation Engineers.

338
00:32:45,021 --> 00:32:53,505
[SPEAKER_33]: It's a national organization that collects traffic counts for a variety of uses, including restaurants somewhat similar to this.

339
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:57,347
[SPEAKER_33]: We did take that what I'll call textbook approach

340
00:32:58,182 --> 00:33:08,111
[SPEAKER_33]: And then we supplemented that with Adam's help where he actually gave us some recent traffic studies that were done for three different existing raising cane sites out in Illinois.

341
00:33:08,131 --> 00:33:12,815
[SPEAKER_33]: And again, as he had mentioned earlier, they are starting to pop up in Massachusetts.

342
00:33:13,596 --> 00:33:15,858
[SPEAKER_33]: But at the time of our initial work, they weren't there.

343
00:33:16,118 --> 00:33:18,380
[SPEAKER_33]: So we use that other data from what he provided.

344
00:33:19,181 --> 00:33:23,925
[SPEAKER_33]: And we took an average of that and it was pretty similar to what the ITE textbook approach said.

345
00:33:24,814 --> 00:33:36,500
[SPEAKER_33]: But just to make sure we weren't missing anything, we opted to use the busiest site out of that database and essentially base the traffic on what I'd call a worst case basis, the maximum generation that we saw.

346
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,561
[SPEAKER_33]: So that's what we took a look at.

347
00:33:38,781 --> 00:33:46,685
[SPEAKER_33]: And then we also, again, accounted for the fact that some of these people, the majority, in fact, are already driving by the site and would be convenience trips.

348
00:33:47,385 --> 00:33:48,846
[SPEAKER_33]: So when we took a look at all that,

349
00:33:49,357 --> 00:33:53,960
[SPEAKER_33]: the impacts and kind of the periphery of this aerial really weren't that noticeable.

350
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:57,782
[SPEAKER_33]: What we did do was focus back in, if you could jump ahead Adam.

351
00:34:01,044 --> 00:34:09,369
[SPEAKER_33]: So what we found introducing that new use in a relatively quiet part of the parking lot, which again I've labeled with that little red star.

352
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:13,712
[SPEAKER_33]: Not a lot going on there today that's remote parking for either

353
00:34:14,453 --> 00:34:18,838
[SPEAKER_33]: the bank or the stop and shop or other uses and really no one's really using it.

354
00:34:18,878 --> 00:34:20,760
[SPEAKER_33]: So it's kind of a quiet corner of the site.

355
00:34:22,142 --> 00:34:26,166
[SPEAKER_33]: What has been happening, there's a couple different things going on out here.

356
00:34:26,847 --> 00:34:30,952
[SPEAKER_33]: First and foremost, I've highlighted it in blue in the upper right corner.

357
00:34:31,835 --> 00:34:36,401
[SPEAKER_33]: The intersection itself route 28 at Riverside of labeled as DCR improvements.

358
00:34:37,382 --> 00:34:48,795
[SPEAKER_33]: They're doing some work out there to clean up a lot of the long standing deficiencies at that location, pulling in some of the curb lines to make it a little more pedestrian friendly little bit of a traffic calming element.

359
00:34:49,620 --> 00:35:00,522
[SPEAKER_33]: And they're also extending that work further to the west on Riverside Avenue and further down route 28 along the plazas frontage, improving the sidewalk condition.

360
00:35:00,882 --> 00:35:02,683
[SPEAKER_33]: I think a new bus stop went in recently.

361
00:35:03,243 --> 00:35:08,924
[SPEAKER_33]: They're still doing that work and I've reached out to them a few times just to kind of stay on top of what's going on there.

362
00:35:09,544 --> 00:35:12,925
[SPEAKER_33]: So that's one thing that's already happening independent of this project.

363
00:35:13,958 --> 00:35:18,961
[SPEAKER_33]: The other, Biolife, was referenced earlier when we were orienting you to the site.

364
00:35:20,001 --> 00:35:34,549
[SPEAKER_33]: They had certain obligations that they had to do, which starting I guess from Route 28, just south of that signal, heading to the south towards the main buildings with the stop and shop and others, they actually striped some bike lanes within the site.

365
00:35:36,139 --> 00:35:41,481
[SPEAKER_33]: You know, predominantly this is an auto oriented area, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't accommodate bicyclists.

366
00:35:42,141 --> 00:35:51,245
[SPEAKER_33]: So, what they had decided to do was stripe some bike lanes to get people comfortably into the site by bike also installed some new bike racks over by the bio life.

367
00:35:52,297 --> 00:36:00,842
[SPEAKER_33]: Um, that project also put in, um, a speed feedback sign, which I'm showing in the upper left-hand side out on Riverside Avenue.

368
00:36:00,862 --> 00:36:09,888
[SPEAKER_33]: Um, that's really nothing specific to that use or this plaza as a whole really, but I know there's been some longstanding speed concerns out here.

369
00:36:09,968 --> 00:36:19,894
[SPEAKER_33]: So that sign was installed, uh, just to reinforce what the speed limit is supposed to be 25 and, um, just bring a little bit more awareness to it for some traffic calming.

370
00:36:20,777 --> 00:36:22,799
[SPEAKER_33]: So that's stuff that's happening in the background.

371
00:36:23,619 --> 00:36:29,604
[SPEAKER_33]: What we've been looking at and talking about is we want to make the site much more accessible, much more orderly.

372
00:36:30,224 --> 00:36:34,528
[SPEAKER_33]: So a few things we had noticed, and I guess I'll just start from the top and work clockwise.

373
00:36:35,288 --> 00:36:42,915
[SPEAKER_33]: There's currently crosswalk going across Riverside Avenue where I've labeled it eliminate mid-block crossing.

374
00:36:43,895 --> 00:36:49,720
[SPEAKER_33]: From a technical standpoint or just kind of a common sense safety standpoint, that's not the best place for a crosswalk.

375
00:36:50,355 --> 00:36:54,677
[SPEAKER_33]: You're mid block, there's a lot of people turning in and out of the plaza driveway at that point.

376
00:36:55,437 --> 00:37:02,280
[SPEAKER_33]: And this is something that had popped up in a study by the state a few years ago as well, that it's really not the best location for that.

377
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:12,404
[SPEAKER_33]: So what we're looking to do is not just eliminate it and walk away, but hopefully restripe that further to the west on Riverside, probably to the left of the driveway.

378
00:37:13,095 --> 00:37:16,617
[SPEAKER_33]: or another nearby location through consultation with the city.

379
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:21,700
[SPEAKER_33]: We're still working out a lot of these details, but we just wanna make something that's a little bit safer.

380
00:37:22,761 --> 00:37:34,428
[SPEAKER_33]: By the same token, anyone who might be walking on Riverside Avenue from some of the nearby neighborhoods, Eric had talked about earlier, we are introducing a break in the fence along the property frontage.

381
00:37:35,588 --> 00:37:41,532
[SPEAKER_33]: So it'll be inviting for pedestrians to come in at that point, instead of just walking in the main plaza driveway.

382
00:37:42,131 --> 00:37:44,653
[SPEAKER_33]: or having to wrap around the site on the other side.

383
00:37:45,133 --> 00:37:46,414
[SPEAKER_33]: So it's a simple connection.

384
00:37:46,834 --> 00:37:54,359
[SPEAKER_33]: We could go back to Eric's plan at some point if we need to, just to look at some of the details, but it gets people in safely to the front door of the building.

385
00:37:55,660 --> 00:38:04,826
[SPEAKER_33]: Similarly, on the opposite side of the plaza, I guess to the east of where we're gonna be putting raising canes, there is sidewalk out there today.

386
00:38:05,246 --> 00:38:06,467
[SPEAKER_33]: It's not in the best shape.

387
00:38:07,067 --> 00:38:10,109
[SPEAKER_33]: So what we're gonna be doing is replacing that with new sidewalk.

388
00:38:10,822 --> 00:38:16,923
[SPEAKER_33]: wrapping it around the raising canes Plaza, as we had shown earlier, and I'll zoom into that in a moment as well.

389
00:38:18,404 --> 00:38:25,626
[SPEAKER_33]: Just to kind of again focus on some of the safety elements of this and pedestrians are certainly the most vulnerable so we don't want to ignore that.

390
00:38:27,726 --> 00:38:30,927
[SPEAKER_33]: The other item at the Riverside Avenue site driveway.

391
00:38:31,247 --> 00:38:35,388
[SPEAKER_33]: This has been talked about over the years and there was some striping put in recently.

392
00:38:36,519 --> 00:38:39,660
[SPEAKER_33]: Basically, do not block the box is what it's referred to as.

393
00:38:40,221 --> 00:38:45,522
[SPEAKER_33]: Just kind of diagonal striping out there that tells people not to pull their car and block the driveway.

394
00:38:46,363 --> 00:38:52,765
[SPEAKER_33]: Most people prefer to avoid that anyway, so they don't have people giving them dirty looks, but we found it's helpful to reinforce it.

395
00:38:53,365 --> 00:38:57,807
[SPEAKER_33]: Problem is when that was last done, the pavement markings have faded.

396
00:38:58,427 --> 00:39:04,149
[SPEAKER_33]: So what we're going to be doing is reintroducing those, but using what's called thermoplastic pavement markings.

397
00:39:04,745 --> 00:39:10,768
[SPEAKER_33]: where it's the same kind of stuff they use on highways, much more durable, holds up longer, much more visible.

398
00:39:11,248 --> 00:39:14,749
[SPEAKER_33]: So we'll get that element back in there, which I think would be helpful.

399
00:39:16,610 --> 00:39:20,232
[SPEAKER_33]: Moving a little further to the left, this one was interesting.

400
00:39:20,292 --> 00:39:31,377
[SPEAKER_33]: Initially, we were not looking at this intersection, Commercial Street at Riverside, and through discussions with the mobility department, they pointed out that Signal has some existing issues.

401
00:39:32,465 --> 00:39:35,507
[SPEAKER_33]: where, simply put, the detection is not working.

402
00:39:36,067 --> 00:39:47,072
[SPEAKER_33]: So when you pull up as a driver on Commercial Street, there's no communication to the signal that you're sitting there waiting to turn onto Riverside Avenue, which certainly can be beyond frustrating.

403
00:39:47,933 --> 00:39:49,994
[SPEAKER_33]: We took a look inside the signal cabinets.

404
00:39:50,054 --> 00:40:00,499
[SPEAKER_33]: We think we have a solution that can be implemented there, and we're gonna talk some more with the City Mobility Department about that to get that in place and address that condition.

405
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:03,673
[SPEAKER_33]: A lot of this is still a work in progress.

406
00:40:03,713 --> 00:40:15,205
[SPEAKER_33]: I think globally we've identified what needs to be done, but we're just still in communication just to make sure we're getting everything right with the various department staff that we're talking to.

407
00:40:17,367 --> 00:40:22,433
[SPEAKER_33]: Actually, it might be helpful to jump ahead here, Adam, if you don't mind just zooming into the site a little bit in the next slide.

408
00:40:23,996 --> 00:40:26,479
[SPEAKER_33]: So this is, you know, go back one if you don't mind.

409
00:40:27,079 --> 00:40:27,379
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you.

410
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:37,570
[SPEAKER_33]: So this is the same graphic that was shown earlier on the drive through and Adam did a pretty comprehensive job of explaining this so I don't need to belabor it too much.

411
00:40:38,831 --> 00:40:43,776
[SPEAKER_33]: But I guess starting from the right, you can see here again the sidewalk we're introducing from Route 28.

412
00:40:44,897 --> 00:40:50,124
[SPEAKER_33]: heading down and wrapping around the site, so you can walk comfortably comfortably to the front door.

413
00:40:51,185 --> 00:40:54,709
[SPEAKER_33]: Likewise, there is a pedestrian connection we're proposing from Riverside.

414
00:40:56,411 --> 00:41:01,458
[SPEAKER_33]: Now what we want is to avoid any conflicts with the drive through so first and foremost,

415
00:41:02,026 --> 00:41:07,170
[SPEAKER_33]: There's two existing curb cuts that lead to the existing parking field that's part of the property.

416
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:12,694
[SPEAKER_33]: Those obviously have to be closed to have a controlled drive-through environment, which is what we're doing.

417
00:41:13,595 --> 00:41:18,038
[SPEAKER_33]: Side benefit is that it makes it an easier path for pedestrians to get to and from the building.

418
00:41:19,399 --> 00:41:26,324
[SPEAKER_33]: The drive-through layout itself, I'd say is very creative and something should probably be looked at more in the industry.

419
00:41:26,384 --> 00:41:31,228
[SPEAKER_33]: I know there's a lot of fast food and coffee shops that have queuing issues.

420
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:36,844
[SPEAKER_33]: This is a very effective way of controlling that during the peak times that Adam had talked about.

421
00:41:37,925 --> 00:41:46,273
[SPEAKER_33]: Again, we had actually looked at data from three existing sites out in Illinois and found the average queue was about 10 vehicles.

422
00:41:47,203 --> 00:41:49,925
[SPEAKER_33]: Sometimes it got up in the low 20s.

423
00:41:50,825 --> 00:41:55,888
[SPEAKER_33]: This site has been designed so you can contain 26 cars full length in the drive-through.

424
00:41:55,908 --> 00:42:04,612
[SPEAKER_33]: Now, that shouldn't be something that you see every day, but we certainly wanted to make sure that we could accommodate it in the event it ever did happen.

425
00:42:05,033 --> 00:42:13,137
[SPEAKER_33]: One, I suppose, nice benefit to this is that the entrance to Raising Canes is not directly onto Riverside, not directly onto Route 28.

426
00:42:13,597 --> 00:42:14,998
[SPEAKER_33]: You have to go into the plaza,

427
00:42:15,486 --> 00:42:21,950
[SPEAKER_33]: And it's probably about a combined 250 feet from route 28 turning into the parking lot to the site.

428
00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:26,892
[SPEAKER_33]: So we're kind of remote, so there shouldn't be any spillover effects onto the surrounding streets.

429
00:42:27,893 --> 00:42:33,396
[SPEAKER_33]: And again, this two lane scenario, they run it at other locations, I understand that it's pretty effective.

430
00:42:34,217 --> 00:42:36,518
[SPEAKER_33]: So there's really no reason to think it can't work here.

431
00:42:37,739 --> 00:42:46,965
[SPEAKER_33]: I can tell you, as Adam had mentioned earlier, some of the problems you see at other food uses are that they have a very complicated menu.

432
00:42:47,546 --> 00:42:53,649
[SPEAKER_33]: People ordering coffees with various flavors, decaf, whatever, tends to slow the operation down.

433
00:42:55,391 --> 00:43:02,195
[SPEAKER_33]: Cane's has a very focused menu, and because of that, they tend to put them through the line pretty quick, which keeps the

434
00:43:02,739 --> 00:43:05,820
[SPEAKER_33]: queuing down to a controlled area as shown here.

435
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:12,962
[SPEAKER_33]: So really, their menu is actually very effective in helping control the traffic components of this.

436
00:43:14,203 --> 00:43:18,824
[SPEAKER_33]: Again, we are talking, continuing to talk with the city mobility and planning staff.

437
00:43:20,245 --> 00:43:30,628
[SPEAKER_33]: The parking demand should be adequately contained through what we're showing to the left of the building in the event there was a peak time or someone wanted to avoid the drive-through.

438
00:43:31,471 --> 00:43:38,333
[SPEAKER_33]: that certainly be free to use the parking on the bottom side of the screen, which as you can see is pretty empty in this photo anyway.

439
00:43:38,353 --> 00:43:48,077
[SPEAKER_33]: We will be talking to the city staff about possibly introducing some kind of crosswalk there if found to be appropriate and beneficial.

440
00:43:48,917 --> 00:43:57,660
[SPEAKER_33]: But we do think that the parking can be accommodated as shown, and it should be predominantly drive-through use given the efficiency that they have in doing that.

441
00:43:58,815 --> 00:44:04,400
[SPEAKER_33]: Now, one thing we did here, if we could jump ahead one slide, Adam, thank you.

442
00:44:06,022 --> 00:44:18,093
[SPEAKER_33]: The plan that we have, we certainly like it and think it could be effective, but I understand there may have been some concerns about the relationship between raising canes and the bank shown on the upper left-hand side of the screen.

443
00:44:19,254 --> 00:44:22,617
[SPEAKER_33]: This is obviously just a sketch and nothing that's been fully engineered.

444
00:44:23,342 --> 00:44:28,245
[SPEAKER_33]: I believe this has been broached informally with the bank just to take their temperature on it.

445
00:44:28,906 --> 00:44:45,357
[SPEAKER_33]: But the idea with this would be that would be dividing the two uses a little bit more than is what's out there today with the layout, where we'd have diagonal parking for the bank as shown on the left side, and in a one-way counterclockwise rotation around their building.

446
00:44:46,028 --> 00:44:48,030
[SPEAKER_33]: which certainly works with their operation.

447
00:44:49,191 --> 00:45:00,320
[SPEAKER_33]: What we don't want to do are see people from that parcel or people choosing to try to cut through that area, coming through on the top and immediately facing exiting drive-through traffic.

448
00:45:00,961 --> 00:45:14,532
[SPEAKER_33]: So what we're exploring is where I'm showing that red arrow is perhaps making that a one-way aisle, reducing the width of that a little bit just to reinforce that, and putting up appropriate do not enter and one-way signs

449
00:45:15,682 --> 00:45:20,145
[SPEAKER_33]: You may even pick up a few parking spaces out of reducing the width of that drive aisle.

450
00:45:21,126 --> 00:45:26,829
[SPEAKER_33]: I'm not sure I think it was someone on the city, actually that brought that up so we wanted to explore it.

451
00:45:27,609 --> 00:45:33,073
[SPEAKER_33]: But I think it's something we pretty readily could add to the plan just brings a little bit more control to the mix.

452
00:45:33,753 --> 00:45:36,655
[SPEAKER_33]: So we're going to continue to talk about that with city staff.

453
00:45:38,176 --> 00:45:46,261
[SPEAKER_33]: So overall out of this, again, we tried to make this as real world as possible, not just pulling numbers out of the textbook.

454
00:45:46,301 --> 00:45:55,887
[SPEAKER_33]: As I said, looking at real data from existing raising canes in pretty successful locations, we have a good handle on how much traffic this will generate.

455
00:45:56,347 --> 00:46:04,993
[SPEAKER_33]: We have a good handle on what the drive through can be expected to see and through Bowler and the rest of the team, we've made sure we've designed it to accommodate that.

456
00:46:06,479 --> 00:46:11,422
[SPEAKER_33]: One last thing I think I'll start on and perhaps others in the team can finish it on the next slide.

457
00:46:13,863 --> 00:46:14,623
[SPEAKER_33]: EV charging.

458
00:46:16,424 --> 00:46:20,846
[SPEAKER_33]: This is obviously a short visit for most people who are raising canes.

459
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:27,470
[SPEAKER_33]: And I'm not sure the exact time, but it's certainly not like an office where someone's there the entire day, unless they're really hungry.

460
00:46:28,570 --> 00:46:34,073
[SPEAKER_33]: But we are looking at doing some EV charging and actually good ones level two has shown here.

461
00:46:34,709 --> 00:46:38,752
[SPEAKER_33]: So if someone's visiting the site, they can get a little bit of boost before going on their way.

462
00:46:40,233 --> 00:46:46,938
[SPEAKER_33]: So we can talk more about that if needed, but as far as the traffic goes, I'm pretty confident with what we've come up with as a group.

463
00:46:47,138 --> 00:46:55,585
[SPEAKER_33]: We're gonna continue to talk to the city staff and I can turn it back to probably Adam or Kathleen, if you'd like to talk more about the EV element.

464
00:46:56,105 --> 00:46:59,708
[SPEAKER_33]: And I'm certainly here to take any questions you might have along the way.

465
00:47:00,248 --> 00:47:01,549
[SPEAKER_33]: So thank you for your time.

466
00:47:03,231 --> 00:47:03,572
[SPEAKER_33]: Absolutely.

467
00:47:03,592 --> 00:47:11,550
[SPEAKER_31]: I'd like to address the electric vehicle charging and then I'll deal with the special permit issue that we have with regard to loading.

468
00:47:12,101 --> 00:47:12,782
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, absolutely.

469
00:47:13,162 --> 00:47:17,085
[SPEAKER_05]: We've seen EV charging become standard in states like California and New Jersey.

470
00:47:17,865 --> 00:47:23,310
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've partnered with Blink, which is a third party that will operate the charging stations.

471
00:47:23,350 --> 00:47:28,253
[SPEAKER_05]: We provide the power and let them power off of our grid, but they run the operation.

472
00:47:29,194 --> 00:47:36,460
[SPEAKER_05]: They maintain them so that they're properly working and the restaurant crew don't have to maintain them.

473
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:39,180
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a pretty good partnership with them.

474
00:47:40,401 --> 00:47:51,803
[SPEAKER_05]: As Pat said, most people aren't gonna be inside of our business for more than, if they're dining in 15 minutes, because they get their food even quicker inside the restaurant, usually like 30 seconds.

475
00:47:52,704 --> 00:48:06,807
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're providing the Fast IQ 200 level two series chargers at, well, I can get technical, but I mean, for the most part, they're gonna get a little bit of a boost while they're parked and eating, but they're not gonna fully charge their car.

476
00:48:07,647 --> 00:48:08,988
[SPEAKER_06]: more than happy to provide that here.

477
00:48:11,309 --> 00:48:16,812
[SPEAKER_31]: And I think we did also have some discussions with staff about the specific location of those.

478
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:19,573
[SPEAKER_31]: So that's why they're not on the plan at this point.

479
00:48:20,614 --> 00:48:33,521
[SPEAKER_31]: Because there was some discussion of it being outside of the lease premises so that in fact, employees could utilize the charger in addition to individuals who were there just for to pick up their food.

480
00:48:35,726 --> 00:48:37,514
[SPEAKER_31]: But there was always an intent to include them.

481
00:48:39,327 --> 00:48:43,790
[SPEAKER_31]: And, and in addition, so in addition to the special permit site plan review.

482
00:48:44,630 --> 00:49:07,643
[SPEAKER_31]: We also have a request for a special permit to either wave wave the dedicated loading space, and, and under the new provisions of the code, I draw your attention first to 6.1 point three of the ordinance which appears to exempt non residential uses with 500 that 5000 square feet or less of leasing space from the minimum requirements.

483
00:49:08,764 --> 00:49:23,615
[SPEAKER_31]: unclear as to whether that was to affect the loading requirements it seems to be in the general language, but section 6.17 is still there which requires one loading space for 2000 to 15,000 row square feet of area.

484
00:49:27,558 --> 00:49:53,590
[SPEAKER_31]: So standing alone, this building, if it were to be viewed under 6.17, would require a dedicated space, but that is also further complicated by 6.1.7.1, which indicates that if you have a group of buildings, that you can calculate the gross footage of the total building area, and then apply that, which would require

485
00:49:54,270 --> 00:50:12,213
[SPEAKER_31]: for spaces for the entire parcel owned by the fells bellsway Plaza limited ownership interest, and they do have those spaces located on the southerly portion of the property but obviously that's not close in distance to where

486
00:50:12,853 --> 00:50:14,534
[SPEAKER_31]: this particular use is going to be.

487
00:50:14,654 --> 00:50:24,698
[SPEAKER_31]: So as a practical matter, we understand and we wanted to bring before the board that we understand people aren't going to dolly all the supplies from the stop and shop, back of stop and shop to the front.

488
00:50:25,498 --> 00:50:38,724
[SPEAKER_31]: So as you've seen on the plans, we've provided a spot, a loading spot, which will be available on off hours in the morning prior to opening the hours of operation being nine to 11 Monday through

489
00:50:42,265 --> 00:50:47,526
[SPEAKER_31]: Thursday and then the weekends open until 12 in the evening.

490
00:50:48,467 --> 00:50:53,748
[SPEAKER_31]: We are going to have to file with the city council special permit for extended hours.

491
00:50:53,908 --> 00:50:58,829
[SPEAKER_31]: At that point, we'd be requesting that those extended hours also apply to delivery.

492
00:50:59,569 --> 00:51:09,872
[SPEAKER_31]: But rather than dedicating a space, certainly we think that we've provided a loading area that will be sufficient during off hours to unload product.

493
00:51:10,412 --> 00:51:16,035
[SPEAKER_31]: Because it wouldn't be a situation where you would have product unloading during the business hours in any event.

494
00:51:16,895 --> 00:51:20,837
[SPEAKER_05]: And if I could add Kathleen we have a centralized warehouse in Taunton that

495
00:51:21,897 --> 00:51:26,881
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything comes from paper products, chicken, Coca-Cola, other supplies.

496
00:51:27,862 --> 00:51:28,883
[SPEAKER_05]: They all come from there.

497
00:51:29,404 --> 00:51:34,188
[SPEAKER_05]: So that truck, depending on how busy this restaurant is, may come once a week, could come three times a week.

498
00:51:35,189 --> 00:51:39,653
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's not going to be different trucks coming all times of the day that it will be after the restaurant closes.

499
00:51:42,638 --> 00:51:48,719
[SPEAKER_31]: The other special waivers that we were looking for related to the plans and I submitted that with the application.

500
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:57,862
[SPEAKER_31]: There was a waiver, which I believe this board can act on of the incremental elevations on the site.

501
00:51:58,182 --> 00:52:00,262
[SPEAKER_31]: This isn't already a developed site and.

502
00:52:03,103 --> 00:52:07,044
[SPEAKER_31]: I don't think there's any need for the elevations onto our lines for elevations.

503
00:52:07,204 --> 00:52:24,347
[SPEAKER_31]: In addition, the site plan review calls for the elevations of all the buildings located on the site again those are all existing and have been existing for quite a period of time and are typically all one story buildings so there isn't any difference in elevations between the buildings that you have on site.

504
00:52:25,007 --> 00:52:27,248
[SPEAKER_31]: So we also asked for a waiver as to that requirement.

505
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:29,501
[SPEAKER_31]: when the plan was submitted.

506
00:52:30,401 --> 00:52:34,725
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think with that, we can take questions or comments from the, from the board.

507
00:52:40,189 --> 00:52:44,472
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much for the, for the presentation to everyone on the on the canes team.

508
00:52:44,892 --> 00:52:45,653
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

509
00:52:47,290 --> 00:52:52,612
[SPEAKER_08]: Any first we usually see if there's any city staff that want to weigh in quickly.

510
00:52:53,652 --> 00:52:55,793
[SPEAKER_08]: If there's anyone here who'd like to do that.

511
00:52:56,953 --> 00:53:08,477
[SPEAKER_08]: Building Commissioner, you don't have to feel like you need to or know you're here more and attendance to watch and see the board at work but Mr. Chair, thank you.

512
00:53:08,818 --> 00:53:15,780
[SPEAKER_32]: No, no comments at this time I did review the project on we found it to, you know, to be, you know, substantially

513
00:53:16,723 --> 00:53:17,504
[SPEAKER_32]: In compliance.

514
00:53:18,946 --> 00:53:31,242
[SPEAKER_32]: The only thing I would mention is we did have something new in our zoning ordinance come up that probably I'm not exactly sure if I commented on in my letter of refusal but um.

515
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:54,859
[SPEAKER_32]: more than one principal building on a lot, I'm not sure if I addressed that with Attorney Desmond, at the time we were looking that over but might just be something that should be noteworthy or mentioned in the order, given, given if the board does decide to, you know, to approve the project, that just might be one thing that you may want to, you know, just put in your, in your front view, you know,

516
00:53:55,741 --> 00:53:56,681
[SPEAKER_32]: That's really about it.

517
00:53:56,821 --> 00:54:02,643
[SPEAKER_32]: I think that the only other thing was the loading zone, which, again, I don't see a great deal of impact here.

518
00:54:03,203 --> 00:54:07,924
[SPEAKER_32]: You know, this type of operation doesn't really require many trips during the day.

519
00:54:07,984 --> 00:54:11,465
[SPEAKER_32]: It's not constantly, you know, fueling up with new supplies.

520
00:54:11,485 --> 00:54:18,607
[SPEAKER_32]: It's usually once a day, maybe twice a day on a busy day, but I don't see, again, that there's any impact.

521
00:54:18,647 --> 00:54:22,868
[SPEAKER_32]: So other than that, I have no further comments, but thank you very much for considering me.

522
00:54:24,331 --> 00:54:24,811
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, thank you.

523
00:54:24,831 --> 00:54:34,378
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's before we discuss and comment as a board and interact with the applicant, let's, let's go to the public.

524
00:54:34,918 --> 00:54:49,568
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to mention for those who are viewing and participating tonight that we are making a recommendation as to a special permanent safe plan to the city council, so the city council is the ultimate special permit granting authority here.

525
00:54:50,649 --> 00:55:00,271
[SPEAKER_08]: In addition to some of the other things that attorney Desmond mentioned, of course, but this is a one step and you might think of as a two step process in terms of public engagement.

526
00:55:00,311 --> 00:55:06,252
[SPEAKER_08]: So Amanda, could you let us know if we have folks who are interested in participating from the public?

527
00:55:07,693 --> 00:55:16,595
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so if anyone is interested from the public, if you could use your reaction tool at the bottom of the screen to either raise your hand or put a note in the chat.

528
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:31,048
[SPEAKER_01]: I see actually something from, and as far as the chat, we can't use the comments in the chat as part of public record unless you speak them into the record.

529
00:55:31,248 --> 00:55:34,350
[SPEAKER_01]: So I see a note from someone in the chat.

530
00:55:34,410 --> 00:55:36,291
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you like to speak into the record?

531
00:55:39,413 --> 00:55:40,293
[SPEAKER_01]: Steven Catino.

532
00:55:42,434 --> 00:55:44,716
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, yeah, I don't see any problems with this.

533
00:55:44,796 --> 00:55:47,197
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of like the idea of something different, something new.

534
00:55:49,225 --> 00:55:51,426
[SPEAKER_01]: And could you provide your, I'm sorry, David.

535
00:55:51,446 --> 00:55:55,649
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just going to ask if you could provide your full name and your address for the record.

536
00:55:55,949 --> 00:56:01,913
[SPEAKER_04]: Steven Catino and I'm from 8587 Albion Street in Medford.

537
00:56:02,433 --> 00:56:04,914
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for being in here and thanks for participating, Steven.

538
00:56:05,275 --> 00:56:05,535
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

539
00:56:05,795 --> 00:56:06,255
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

540
00:56:11,738 --> 00:56:17,622
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm taking a quick look at our office email and not seeing any additional comments.

541
00:56:25,173 --> 00:56:36,576
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, well with that, we'll go to the board and close our public comment portion of the proceeding and move along past the board, we have a board member who'd like to pose some questions of the group.

542
00:56:39,377 --> 00:56:43,377
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, class.

543
00:56:43,397 --> 00:56:43,438
[SPEAKER_18]: Hi.

544
00:56:44,618 --> 00:56:48,699
[SPEAKER_18]: Thanks to the team for submitting this application.

545
00:56:50,959 --> 00:56:53,140
[SPEAKER_18]: Personally think it's going to be a nice addition to the.

546
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:57,750
[SPEAKER_18]: to the plaza and maybe add some activation to that corner.

547
00:56:58,590 --> 00:57:08,817
[SPEAKER_18]: I have just a couple maybe questions might help to bring up the site plan if that's easy enough to do.

548
00:57:08,837 --> 00:57:11,198
[SPEAKER_20]: Absolutely.

549
00:57:18,363 --> 00:57:18,683
[SPEAKER_20]: Cool.

550
00:57:19,904 --> 00:57:20,604
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, that's great.

551
00:57:23,930 --> 00:57:26,072
[SPEAKER_18]: These are in no particular order, just what I wrote down.

552
00:57:26,092 --> 00:57:33,838
[SPEAKER_18]: It seems to me that it looks like you're doing a nice job of landscaping here.

553
00:57:33,858 --> 00:57:35,619
[SPEAKER_18]: Could you actually pan down just a little?

554
00:57:37,421 --> 00:57:37,701
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

555
00:57:37,961 --> 00:57:44,246
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, yeah, that's fine.

556
00:57:44,386 --> 00:57:50,451
[SPEAKER_18]: There's obviously a lease line, and there's a very conspicuous break between where you'll be landscaping and where you won't.

557
00:57:50,771 --> 00:57:52,792
[SPEAKER_18]: I just think it would make sense to be

558
00:57:54,362 --> 00:58:02,507
[SPEAKER_18]: thoughtful about how that transition between your lease area and the rest of the landscaped area along that edge is treated.

559
00:58:04,709 --> 00:58:08,592
[SPEAKER_18]: So that it doesn't look so different.

560
00:58:10,453 --> 00:58:22,982
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, I guess basically what I'm advocating for is that the section along the front of the bank, you know, could potentially get the same treatment if it's only for a small area and just to make a more sort of unified

561
00:58:23,948 --> 00:58:25,149
[SPEAKER_18]: look in that whole area.

562
00:58:25,469 --> 00:58:39,261
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm also curious because I use this intersection a lot and I know that there's like this new bump out that they've built there and it's sort of been half done for seems like a year.

563
00:58:39,281 --> 00:58:48,729
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm not really seeing what I think is the line work that would reflect that on this plan.

564
00:58:50,335 --> 00:59:00,777
[SPEAKER_18]: I was just looking on Google Maps and it does actually show that bump out, which is a really nice addition.

565
00:59:00,817 --> 00:59:14,659
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm assuming that the state is doing that as part of the Felsway, but it's sort of creating like a deeper section of sidewalk there.

566
00:59:16,239 --> 00:59:19,700
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm just wondering how what you're doing

567
00:59:20,661 --> 00:59:27,104
[SPEAKER_18]: is or isn't sort of integrating into that revised corner condition.

568
00:59:27,644 --> 00:59:43,470
[SPEAKER_18]: And that sort of ties into a couple other questions, like you said you're getting rid of the mid-block crosswalk, which makes a lot of sense, but you are keeping the one right at the intersection of Riverside and the Felsway, correct?

569
00:59:45,911 --> 00:59:46,151
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

570
00:59:47,452 --> 00:59:47,652
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

571
00:59:49,353 --> 00:59:53,734
[SPEAKER_05]: one in coordination with city staff, that's mid block.

572
00:59:54,555 --> 00:59:55,315
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, great.

573
00:59:55,555 --> 00:59:56,675
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that makes a lot of sense.

574
00:59:57,476 --> 01:00:12,520
[SPEAKER_18]: I think, you know, just for the purposes of this visual it would just make sense to get that those new curb lines at that corner on there, if nothing else to sort of illustrate what maybe the state has planned and how it sort of fits into what you're doing because I know you have

575
01:00:13,070 --> 01:00:15,432
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, you talked about the break in the fence and things like that.

576
01:00:15,512 --> 01:00:22,957
[SPEAKER_05]: So this line right here, it's just very faint and that's the bituminous pavement that's currently out there.

577
01:00:22,977 --> 01:00:27,941
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, but no, I think if you actually look at the.

578
01:00:29,002 --> 01:00:32,805
[SPEAKER_18]: Like, if you were to look at Google Earth, you would see that it actually goes out next to.

579
01:00:33,667 --> 01:00:37,851
[SPEAKER_18]: the, the intersection down to two lanes at that spot.

580
01:00:38,472 --> 01:00:40,534
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, so it actually like see where that white car is.

581
01:00:40,594 --> 01:00:44,878
[SPEAKER_18]: And that, I think that the curb actually comes out and no, the other one below.

582
01:00:45,558 --> 01:00:45,859
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

583
01:00:45,939 --> 01:00:49,062
[SPEAKER_18]: It would actually come out and go around that car currently.

584
01:00:49,682 --> 01:00:50,563
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

585
01:00:53,366 --> 01:00:57,730
[SPEAKER_18]: So just, you know, understanding all the, all the sort of wine work and getting,

586
01:00:58,267 --> 01:01:01,188
[SPEAKER_18]: the public right away on this drawing would be helpful.

587
01:01:01,328 --> 01:01:07,051
[SPEAKER_18]: And then, so if you pan towards, put the building more in the center of the screen.

588
01:01:09,072 --> 01:01:15,415
[SPEAKER_18]: So then it would help us to understand how there's this sort of system of sidewalks that is gonna start going down the Fellsway.

589
01:01:15,435 --> 01:01:19,837
[SPEAKER_18]: So it leads to a couple more of my questions.

590
01:01:20,117 --> 01:01:25,559
[SPEAKER_18]: A, your sidewalks, I think are, you know, the L-shaped sidewalks around the site are great.

591
01:01:26,580 --> 01:01:27,400
[SPEAKER_18]: How wide are those?

592
01:01:29,830 --> 01:01:30,951
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't even trust this.

593
01:01:33,072 --> 01:01:33,373
[SPEAKER_18]: Pardon?

594
01:01:33,973 --> 01:01:34,473
[SPEAKER_18]: Five feet.

595
01:01:35,474 --> 01:01:35,934
[SPEAKER_20]: Five feet.

596
01:01:38,957 --> 01:01:45,602
[SPEAKER_20]: It seems a little narrow for a place that's very car-centric.

597
01:01:47,603 --> 01:01:51,886
[SPEAKER_18]: There's part of me that wishes it could be buffered by landscape.

598
01:01:51,906 --> 01:01:54,808
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sort of on the fence about that.

599
01:01:56,432 --> 01:02:00,695
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, we're trying in Medford to sort of implement complete streets.

600
01:02:01,896 --> 01:02:06,319
[SPEAKER_18]: Certainly five feet wouldn't really fall, I think, within that dimension.

601
01:02:06,359 --> 01:02:08,400
[SPEAKER_18]: I could totally be wrong.

602
01:02:09,061 --> 01:02:19,107
[SPEAKER_18]: But beyond that, I think maybe the bigger issue is the lack of a crosswalk across that driveway right there.

603
01:02:20,048 --> 01:02:22,149
[SPEAKER_18]: And I don't believe there's one today.

604
01:02:22,750 --> 01:02:23,770
[SPEAKER_18]: It doesn't look like there is.

605
01:02:26,419 --> 01:02:39,543
[SPEAKER_18]: you know, any effort to sort of make that crossing more pedestrian friendly would have to include a crosswalk in that location, which is sort of conspicuously missing.

606
01:02:39,583 --> 01:02:52,047
[SPEAKER_18]: And I would really advocate for adding a crosswalk or, you know, and if it didn't make sense right at the apron, then moving it back, whatever dimension, Pat, to create a crosswalk.

607
01:02:53,492 --> 01:02:57,837
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, so that people could continue sort of down towards, there's a bus stop right there.

608
01:02:58,538 --> 01:03:07,808
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, and, and just sort of completing that, that gesture that started and done a really nice job of in that location.

609
01:03:09,950 --> 01:03:11,973
[SPEAKER_33]: Um, I could jump in on that just for a second.

610
01:03:12,939 --> 01:03:19,762
[SPEAKER_33]: Very good points all and the crosswalk you're talking about, it's the driveway itself on Route 28, correct?

611
01:03:19,782 --> 01:03:20,002
[SPEAKER_33]: Correct.

612
01:03:20,042 --> 01:03:24,924
[SPEAKER_33]: Yeah, I do have a message into DCR about that.

613
01:03:24,945 --> 01:03:27,906
[SPEAKER_33]: I've traded some information with them over the past year.

614
01:03:28,906 --> 01:03:32,569
[SPEAKER_33]: What you're seeing out there obviously is a work in progress, not quite done yet.

615
01:03:33,749 --> 01:03:36,031
[SPEAKER_33]: I'm assuming they'd be doing a crosswalk there.

616
01:03:36,071 --> 01:03:38,853
[SPEAKER_33]: I don't know for a fact because I haven't seen their final plans.

617
01:03:39,993 --> 01:03:45,477
[SPEAKER_33]: But if they're doing all that work, I'd assume they'd be covering that, but we could certainly talk.

618
01:03:45,517 --> 01:03:48,038
[SPEAKER_33]: And this is something your mobility group had raised as well.

619
01:03:48,159 --> 01:03:49,900
[SPEAKER_33]: So we are looking into that further.

620
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:55,203
[SPEAKER_33]: I'm just trying to get a better understanding of officially what the DCR limits of work are going to be.

621
01:03:56,292 --> 01:03:56,652
[SPEAKER_18]: Perfect.

622
01:03:57,013 --> 01:04:11,624
[SPEAKER_18]: And are there any plans for any, like, well, let me ask this, in that expanded area of sidewalk where it bumps out into the road more, what is the plan for that sort of horizontal surface?

623
01:04:11,684 --> 01:04:13,906
[SPEAKER_18]: Is it all concrete?

624
01:04:13,946 --> 01:04:25,254
[SPEAKER_18]: I know today, it's been, like, the curbs have been in for, like, it feels like at least a year, but it looks like the sidewalks, there's still, like, exposed dirt, and, like, I'm trying to understand what

625
01:04:27,237 --> 01:04:28,978
[SPEAKER_18]: they're planning on that corner.

626
01:04:30,138 --> 01:04:31,959
[SPEAKER_33]: And that's, I'm trying to get that as well.

627
01:04:32,019 --> 01:04:40,282
[SPEAKER_33]: Typically roadwork, sidewalks, landscaping is more of, um, start up around April 15th, typically depending on weather.

628
01:04:41,003 --> 01:04:49,186
[SPEAKER_33]: Um, so I don't know exactly how long it's been in a state of not being complete, but I do expect they'll be resuming that shortly if they haven't already.

629
01:04:49,926 --> 01:04:52,187
[SPEAKER_33]: Um, so because the bump out.

630
01:04:52,748 --> 01:04:59,492
[SPEAKER_33]: is taking the curb line further into Route 28, and they are doing a new sidewalk around the site on their portion.

631
01:04:59,532 --> 01:05:02,294
[SPEAKER_33]: It doesn't change the site we're doing.

632
01:05:02,674 --> 01:05:04,255
[SPEAKER_33]: We're doing everything within our limits.

633
01:05:04,875 --> 01:05:08,737
[SPEAKER_33]: But out on Route 28, as you had mentioned, it is what they call a road diet.

634
01:05:08,817 --> 01:05:10,298
[SPEAKER_33]: It's two departing lanes now.

635
01:05:11,079 --> 01:05:14,701
[SPEAKER_33]: They've added a bike lane, and it's not only a bike lane, it's a buffered bike lane.

636
01:05:15,172 --> 01:05:17,513
[SPEAKER_33]: So you have two car lanes and one bike lane.

637
01:05:18,073 --> 01:05:21,915
[SPEAKER_33]: We're tying into wherever their sidewalk ends their work.

638
01:05:21,975 --> 01:05:23,876
[SPEAKER_33]: So it's a continuous path into the site.

639
01:05:24,576 --> 01:05:31,339
[SPEAKER_33]: And, you know, Eric and I and others can talk about, you know, exactly what the width of the site sidewalk will be and how that'll work.

640
01:05:31,939 --> 01:05:36,401
[SPEAKER_33]: So just trying to gather a little bit more information, but that's helpful input.

641
01:05:37,201 --> 01:05:37,421
[SPEAKER_18]: Great.

642
01:05:37,581 --> 01:05:37,961
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

643
01:05:40,883 --> 01:05:41,743
[SPEAKER_18]: Let me see.

644
01:05:41,763 --> 01:05:42,683
[SPEAKER_18]: I think.

645
01:05:44,894 --> 01:05:53,596
[SPEAKER_18]: When you went through the presentation, Adam, you talked about, you showed pictures of the inside.

646
01:05:53,776 --> 01:06:04,218
[SPEAKER_18]: So I think I understand it that this is a place that will mostly get drive-through traffic, but you do have in-restaurant seating.

647
01:06:06,338 --> 01:06:06,899
[SPEAKER_18]: Is that correct?

648
01:06:07,339 --> 01:06:07,799
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, we do.

649
01:06:08,959 --> 01:06:13,580
[SPEAKER_05]: Jeff may be able to speak to it exactly, but I think it's about 50 seats inside.

650
01:06:14,998 --> 01:06:17,779
[SPEAKER_05]: and about 40 seats on the patio, I think.

651
01:06:17,799 --> 01:06:18,799
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

652
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:25,882
[SPEAKER_18]: So you showed a really nice photo of like an outdoor seating area in your presentation.

653
01:06:26,042 --> 01:06:27,462
[SPEAKER_18]: Are we going to have that as well?

654
01:06:28,403 --> 01:06:28,923
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, yes, sir.

655
01:06:28,963 --> 01:06:30,063
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be this area.

656
01:06:30,503 --> 01:06:43,728
[SPEAKER_05]: If you can see my cursor that it wouldn't wrap around like the one in Houston that I showed because we don't have as much surface area here, but it will look, um, let me just scroll down.

657
01:06:50,283 --> 01:06:51,184
[SPEAKER_20]: over the lag, sorry.

658
01:06:53,145 --> 01:07:01,430
[SPEAKER_05]: So you would essentially have this canopy right here go across the entire facade.

659
01:07:02,391 --> 01:07:03,291
[SPEAKER_18]: Great.

660
01:07:03,351 --> 01:07:04,032
[SPEAKER_18]: It looks nice.

661
01:07:04,475 --> 01:07:14,544
[SPEAKER_18]: I think I just I think it's important to have the outdoor seating option, especially since you put in a nice spot where it's a little buffered but from the intersection but you know, would add would add life to that area.

662
01:07:15,404 --> 01:07:28,436
[SPEAKER_18]: The only thing I guess that's maybe conspicuously missing is I like the landscaping that you're showing here and it'd be nice if there was a little landscaping around that patio as well, just to sort of, again, complete that that gesture.

663
01:07:30,530 --> 01:07:31,371
[SPEAKER_18]: But maybe I'm missing it.

664
01:07:31,391 --> 01:07:32,312
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know.

665
01:07:32,732 --> 01:07:34,313
[SPEAKER_05]: We're limited on space here.

666
01:07:34,393 --> 01:07:40,278
[SPEAKER_05]: So in order to provide the connectivity back to Riverside, we had to run the sidewalk along the front here.

667
01:07:42,459 --> 01:07:51,706
[SPEAKER_05]: But we do have landscaping along the side of the building to screen the dumpster enclosure and the patio from the dumpster enclosure.

668
01:07:51,726 --> 01:07:58,171
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, well, it'd be nice to see some landscaping out on the patio in some fashion,

669
01:07:59,022 --> 01:08:01,885
[SPEAKER_18]: if it's at all possible.

670
01:08:05,508 --> 01:08:09,052
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that's all I have.

671
01:08:09,773 --> 01:08:10,133
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

672
01:08:10,894 --> 01:08:12,075
[SPEAKER_20]: Excited for chicken wings.

673
01:08:15,538 --> 01:08:22,886
[SPEAKER_08]: Peter, I see that your hand has been raised in a sense for some time, so the floor is yours.

674
01:08:26,495 --> 01:08:27,196
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

675
01:08:28,457 --> 01:08:34,023
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to kind of echo the sentiment that's been raised, and I think this would be a great addition to this area.

676
01:08:34,083 --> 01:08:39,689
[SPEAKER_11]: As someone who is a resident of the Wellington Circle area, I'm certainly looking forward to it.

677
01:08:39,809 --> 01:08:49,099
[SPEAKER_11]: You showed that very nice interior shot, and I wanted to make sure that that interior will be

678
01:08:51,563 --> 01:08:58,304
[SPEAKER_11]: Not, I was going to say that the interior will be accessible, but also that there's a way for people who aren't in cars to order at times when the restaurants open.

679
01:08:58,324 --> 01:09:10,266
[SPEAKER_11]: I've run into this, thankfully not around here, but in other, in other cities where after a certain hour, if you happen to walk to a place or bike to a place, you're out of luck and you can't, can't get food unless you're in a car.

680
01:09:10,366 --> 01:09:20,028
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just want to make sure, because I mean, as someone who would access this location for most of the year on foot or on bike, I want to make sure that I can come get my chickens.

681
01:09:21,010 --> 01:09:24,072
[SPEAKER_11]: And they're not going to tear me away because I'm not in the car.

682
01:09:24,092 --> 01:09:26,934
[SPEAKER_05]: So I mean, we typically do not close our dining rooms early.

683
01:09:26,954 --> 01:09:36,722
[SPEAKER_05]: And the fact that this location, the restaurant would close at 11pm on weekdays and midnight on weekends is would reinforce even more than this restaurant will stay open.

684
01:09:37,669 --> 01:09:38,589
[SPEAKER_05]: along with the drive-through.

685
01:09:38,929 --> 01:09:39,430
[SPEAKER_11]: That's great.

686
01:09:39,570 --> 01:09:41,490
[SPEAKER_11]: That's important to me.

687
01:09:42,151 --> 01:09:51,634
[SPEAKER_11]: And you said you ran a WB40 for the delivery turning movements.

688
01:09:51,674 --> 01:09:56,076
[SPEAKER_11]: I assume that is analogous to what you will be using for deliveries.

689
01:09:57,320 --> 01:09:57,980
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, correct.

690
01:09:58,020 --> 01:10:01,441
[SPEAKER_05]: We've confirmed with the warehouse that that equipment can be utilized here.

691
01:10:01,761 --> 01:10:03,001
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, great.

692
01:10:04,502 --> 01:10:06,702
[SPEAKER_11]: And I appreciate the addition of the bike rack.

693
01:10:06,722 --> 01:10:12,264
[SPEAKER_11]: That's something that, once again, as someone who is likely to access this location by bike, I love to see it.

694
01:10:13,764 --> 01:10:14,264
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely.

695
01:10:15,424 --> 01:10:15,784
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

696
01:10:25,327 --> 01:10:26,227
[SPEAKER_20]: Peter, are you all set then?

697
01:10:27,697 --> 01:10:29,502
[SPEAKER_08]: At least for now, it's not to shut you down.

698
01:10:29,983 --> 01:10:30,605
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep, I'm good.

699
01:10:30,826 --> 01:10:31,427
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, great.

700
01:10:31,969 --> 01:10:33,954
[SPEAKER_08]: Ari, welcome aboard, the floor is yours.

701
01:10:35,794 --> 01:10:36,515
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

702
01:10:37,115 --> 01:10:40,718
[SPEAKER_27]: Seems like a really interesting proposal.

703
01:10:40,738 --> 01:10:43,840
[SPEAKER_27]: This is where I do my weekly grocery shop over at the Aldi.

704
01:10:44,301 --> 01:10:46,382
[SPEAKER_27]: So very familiar with this area.

705
01:10:46,642 --> 01:10:51,066
[SPEAKER_27]: You kind of caught all the traffic questions that I had going in.

706
01:10:52,767 --> 01:10:57,090
[SPEAKER_27]: My two major kind of more comments, I'm sure you've thought about them.

707
01:10:57,491 --> 01:11:01,074
[SPEAKER_27]: The first one is I didn't get a chance to check

708
01:11:01,794 --> 01:11:08,680
[SPEAKER_27]: Whether any or all of the plants were native, we've been trying to support our local pollinator populations.

709
01:11:08,841 --> 01:11:16,968
[SPEAKER_27]: So if we can see if part of the mix of the landscaping can be supportive of that with native plants.

710
01:11:17,509 --> 01:11:22,774
[SPEAKER_27]: And the second question was, since it is such a large parking lot, large shopping area,

711
01:11:23,574 --> 01:11:28,597
[SPEAKER_27]: I know that there can be an issue with litter, especially with drive-thrus.

712
01:11:29,297 --> 01:11:39,983
[SPEAKER_27]: Can you tell us a little bit about whatever routines are developed at other Raising Canes to make sure that there's not a huge littering impact locally?

713
01:11:41,543 --> 01:11:42,544
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, you're correct.

714
01:11:43,324 --> 01:11:46,226
[SPEAKER_05]: That is commonly a problem with other operators.

715
01:11:46,366 --> 01:11:49,628
[SPEAKER_05]: We actually score our restaurants

716
01:11:50,509 --> 01:12:06,300
[SPEAKER_05]: monthly, they get secret shopped, they have unannounced visits from an internal team, and that affects their performance pay at the end of the year, so they are incentivized to keep the lot clean.

717
01:12:14,306 --> 01:12:14,846
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's it?

718
01:12:15,687 --> 01:12:16,688
[SPEAKER_20]: In terms of?

719
01:12:18,349 --> 01:12:19,290
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they'll walk the site

720
01:12:20,270 --> 01:12:22,613
[SPEAKER_06]: periodically throughout the day, pick up litter, throw it away.

721
01:12:22,633 --> 01:12:27,898
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll bust the tables outside if people don't throw away their own

722
01:12:32,083 --> 01:12:32,744
[SPEAKER_06]: packaging.

723
01:12:32,864 --> 01:12:40,570
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't use, unless it's to-go, we use reusable trays with liners.

724
01:12:41,931 --> 01:12:50,899
[SPEAKER_05]: There is disposable plasticware that's used, paper cups, but we don't use styrofoam clamshells unless it's to-go.

725
01:12:51,439 --> 01:12:55,883
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think nationally we're moving away from styrofoam within the next few years.

726
01:12:58,765 --> 01:12:59,386
[SPEAKER_20]: Great, thank you.

727
01:13:08,148 --> 01:13:29,692
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, you're muted, David.

728
01:13:33,345 --> 01:13:33,665
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

729
01:13:33,705 --> 01:13:34,446
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

730
01:13:35,767 --> 01:13:38,629
[SPEAKER_08]: I was just encouraging either Emily or Jackie if you have.

731
01:13:40,330 --> 01:13:41,131
[SPEAKER_08]: You wanted to jump in.

732
01:13:41,151 --> 01:13:42,051
[SPEAKER_08]: If you don't, that's fine.

733
01:13:42,792 --> 01:13:45,974
[SPEAKER_29]: No, I actually had circulation question.

734
01:13:45,994 --> 01:13:50,878
[SPEAKER_29]: This is Vice Chair Jackie McPherson.

735
01:13:51,578 --> 01:13:58,984
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't have any because the presentation actually went over everything, so I didn't want to reiterate something that was already presented.

736
01:14:01,734 --> 01:14:02,895
[SPEAKER_29]: it was thoroughly covered.

737
01:14:04,395 --> 01:14:04,716
[SPEAKER_08]: Excellent.

738
01:14:07,397 --> 01:14:08,177
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're good for now.

739
01:14:08,978 --> 01:14:09,158
[SPEAKER_17]: Yep.

740
01:14:09,398 --> 01:14:10,339
[SPEAKER_17]: No questions.

741
01:14:10,479 --> 01:14:11,319
[SPEAKER_17]: I do like that.

742
01:14:11,399 --> 01:14:14,541
[SPEAKER_17]: The drive through Q is not coming off of the main road.

743
01:14:15,321 --> 01:14:18,663
[SPEAKER_17]: There are other drive throughs in Medford where that is a challenge, so it's nice to see.

744
01:14:18,683 --> 01:14:20,524
[SPEAKER_17]: Um some.

745
01:14:21,584 --> 01:14:25,186
[SPEAKER_17]: Um some thought put into that, but no other

746
01:14:33,248 --> 01:14:33,568
[SPEAKER_08]: Excellent.

747
01:14:34,689 --> 01:14:53,496
[SPEAKER_08]: So I do have a few more questions but I guess where we're headed tonight is to, because the canes team has said that they're still working with the city so I feel like you're getting our initial feedback comments so that you can incorporate them along with the city staff and then we will be seeing you again for

748
01:14:55,237 --> 01:15:03,001
[SPEAKER_08]: you know what would be potentially a final set of recommendations or final discussion before we made final recommendations.

749
01:15:03,401 --> 01:15:15,987
[SPEAKER_31]: Is that fair to say, that's fair to say, you know, with respect to the comments the department had comments I think the only area which we still have to iron out some issues would be with the mobility and the traffic.

750
01:15:18,852 --> 01:15:22,694
[SPEAKER_31]: essentially for raising canes to perform.

751
01:15:23,735 --> 01:15:34,300
[SPEAKER_31]: We've looked at all the rest of them and we're able to meet all of those, but the mobility requests are, you know, we need pricing still on them.

752
01:15:34,680 --> 01:15:45,605
[SPEAKER_31]: And there's some things I think that we're not gonna be able to, having to do with Route 28 and signaling that are just beyond the scope of what

753
01:15:46,442 --> 01:15:53,464
[SPEAKER_31]: this project could bear, frankly, so we still want to work with Todd, and see if we can come to some agreement.

754
01:15:55,024 --> 01:15:55,944
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, that sounds good.

755
01:15:55,964 --> 01:16:07,106
[SPEAKER_08]: So we don't need to go through department head comments at this point because you're still working with them and we'll hear another round or a thumbs up from our departments at the next meeting so that that sounds really great.

756
01:16:08,207 --> 01:16:13,248
[SPEAKER_08]: I just had a few comments that, and a lot of a lot of improvements.

757
01:16:15,143 --> 01:16:23,947
[SPEAKER_08]: especially that access the pedestrian access to the sidewalk to I guess the north is really good.

758
01:16:24,787 --> 01:16:35,291
[SPEAKER_08]: Could you, could you give me a little bit more on the eastern bank parking because I wanted to, you know, I guess one.

759
01:16:36,392 --> 01:16:37,973
[SPEAKER_08]: One question the specific question is.

760
01:16:39,705 --> 01:16:55,694
[SPEAKER_08]: Is some is some of the parking that you're dedicating to Keynes already promised to the bank through some other approval process or through something that the owner may have already promised the city.

761
01:16:59,056 --> 01:16:59,936
[SPEAKER_28]: I'll take that one.

762
01:17:00,616 --> 01:17:04,158
[SPEAKER_28]: Mr Chairman Karen Johnson from charter realty and development.

763
01:17:04,498 --> 01:17:04,759
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

764
01:17:05,777 --> 01:17:10,940
[SPEAKER_28]: owners and owners managers of Felsway Plaza.

765
01:17:12,681 --> 01:17:19,564
[SPEAKER_28]: So if you can see from this plan, there's a darker dashed line.

766
01:17:21,265 --> 01:17:21,765
[SPEAKER_28]: Exactly.

767
01:17:22,045 --> 01:17:33,631
[SPEAKER_28]: That represents the ground lease line for Keynes and the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 spaces specifically excluded from that

768
01:17:35,046 --> 01:17:41,511
[SPEAKER_28]: ground lease area are non exclusive spaces for Eastern Bank for their lease.

769
01:17:42,131 --> 01:17:48,555
[SPEAKER_28]: And so, Eastern's entryway of course is opposite of those parking spaces.

770
01:17:49,236 --> 01:17:57,181
[SPEAKER_28]: They have, I believe it's 19 spaces along the Riverside access, which they primarily use for employees.

771
01:17:58,222 --> 01:17:59,763
[SPEAKER_28]: And then of course they also have drive

772
01:18:01,377 --> 01:18:05,161
[SPEAKER_28]: up window and drive up ATM on the opposite side.

773
01:18:07,524 --> 01:18:12,910
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so those those spots are sort of no one's borrowing from the bank to give to Keynes.

774
01:18:14,231 --> 01:18:14,932
[SPEAKER_28]: That's correct.

775
01:18:15,613 --> 01:18:18,096
[SPEAKER_28]: And that's why that lease line takes a job there.

776
01:18:18,716 --> 01:18:18,937
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

777
01:18:21,618 --> 01:18:24,419
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you give us some context then on this proposal?

778
01:18:24,499 --> 01:18:38,482
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I think what we're seeing here imposed in red would make a lot of sense in particular to provide a little crosswalk there to the entrance of the bank would be a nice feature and the circulation being one way would be a good thing as well.

779
01:18:39,682 --> 01:18:40,462
[SPEAKER_28]: Sure.

780
01:18:41,442 --> 01:18:48,164
[SPEAKER_28]: When we were getting ready for a community meeting, I met with representatives of Eastern Bank and shared the plan with them.

781
01:18:49,776 --> 01:18:54,659
[SPEAKER_28]: You know, on some earlier plans, we had that there was a walk-up ATM on this side.

782
01:18:54,679 --> 01:18:59,541
[SPEAKER_28]: They informed me that was closed and that it's just the entry.

783
01:18:59,962 --> 01:19:05,945
[SPEAKER_28]: And so they asked for some enhancements.

784
01:19:06,265 --> 01:19:15,290
[SPEAKER_28]: And so they explained to me essentially how their operations work and that this is the primary entrance on this side.

785
01:19:16,512 --> 01:19:27,218
[SPEAKER_28]: And they didn't express any concern related to safety, but what we just tried to look at is what would work better from an internal flow for them.

786
01:19:28,098 --> 01:19:38,444
[SPEAKER_28]: And so in working with Pat Dunford from a traffic perspective and Bowler from a site layout perspective, we came up with this alternative plan.

787
01:19:39,364 --> 01:19:44,547
[SPEAKER_28]: And so this, of course, adds additional landscaping at the island areas and

788
01:19:45,768 --> 01:19:49,070
[SPEAKER_28]: or an additional space along this row.

789
01:19:49,090 --> 01:19:57,793
[SPEAKER_28]: I really like one of the board members comments about extending that landscaping along the frontage.

790
01:19:58,153 --> 01:20:05,876
[SPEAKER_28]: And if you noted from the utility plan, there is a fair amount of disturbance in this area to make the connection.

791
01:20:06,556 --> 01:20:11,798
[SPEAKER_28]: So we'll take a look at extending that same landscaping

792
01:20:12,410 --> 01:20:14,271
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't know if it's a good idea to have a theme all the way down the frontage.

793
01:20:14,291 --> 01:20:16,052
[SPEAKER_28]: I thought that was a very good suggestion.

794
01:20:16,072 --> 01:20:18,573
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree, Karen.

795
01:20:18,593 --> 01:20:19,854
[SPEAKER_06]: I would support that.

796
01:20:20,314 --> 01:20:20,634
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah.

797
01:20:20,994 --> 01:20:26,217
[SPEAKER_28]: So one of the things that we do need to do is get some better spot grades out there.

798
01:20:33,503 --> 01:20:39,304
[SPEAKER_28]: that we're working with Adam on, you know, obviously, partly as an improvement here, partly as a land landlord improvement.

799
01:20:39,324 --> 01:20:45,525
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't I don't I don't want you to think that they've been forgotten in the process because we have

800
01:21:02,890 --> 01:21:14,953
[SPEAKER_28]: Um, and we were getting feedback before from the board and the city representatives before going back to Eastern, but they're very supportive of anything that improves that condition for them out there.

801
01:21:15,874 --> 01:21:31,158
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think that's great because it does interplay with the pedestrian access the traffic circulation those concerns that are so central to our review to see that improvement on the sort of other side of that parking aisle is would be would be a great thing.

802
01:21:31,988 --> 01:21:41,223
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you, while we're all here, what's going on in that top corner there seemed to be a lot of oversized vehicles maybe it's like overnight parking or long, long term parking for someone.

803
01:21:41,904 --> 01:21:46,412
[SPEAKER_28]: So, I did, I did get that comment through staff.

804
01:21:47,095 --> 01:21:49,497
[SPEAKER_28]: and talked with our property management group.

805
01:21:49,657 --> 01:22:03,685
[SPEAKER_28]: And honestly, we thought that you were talking about truck parking in the canes pad, which we're at a constant battle of trying to prevent that large tractor trailer overnight parking.

806
01:22:03,705 --> 01:22:15,032
[SPEAKER_28]: Todd Blake noted that he's seeing a lot more of it since on the commercial side, you change the on street parking across from the Dunkin Donuts.

807
01:22:16,515 --> 01:22:18,317
[SPEAKER_28]: But apparently that wasn't it at all.

808
01:22:18,537 --> 01:22:22,262
[SPEAKER_28]: It was this parking that's right along the access to Riverside.

809
01:22:23,083 --> 01:22:33,595
[SPEAKER_28]: And when we had a staff meeting with the city I drove through there, and it was a little bit later in the afternoon so I, I think I know that they are Eastern Bank service vehicles.

810
01:22:34,488 --> 01:22:41,410
[SPEAKER_28]: why they are all there at the end of the day, I'm unclear of, and I do have to have a conversation with them about that.

811
01:22:41,470 --> 01:22:51,692
[SPEAKER_28]: But please be aware that every single one of those vehicles on the side is marked EBC, and if you call the phone number, it's to Eastern Bank.

812
01:22:51,832 --> 01:23:01,354
[SPEAKER_28]: So I'm not sure if they're using this as sort of a regional hub for their service vehicles, but we'll find out.

813
01:23:01,734 --> 01:23:02,354
[SPEAKER_28]: Regardless,

814
01:23:03,505 --> 01:23:09,436
[SPEAKER_28]: It is Eastern Bank's parking, effectively employee parking that they're taking up.

815
01:23:11,821 --> 01:23:15,508
[SPEAKER_28]: So I'm not entirely sure how or if we'll resolve it.

816
01:23:16,191 --> 01:23:32,268
[SPEAKER_28]: I appreciate you sharing that information and answering the question and indulging me as I dive too deep into your property management challenges but no worries we understand that this is a very visible shopping center and trust me your frustrations are our frustration.

817
01:23:34,295 --> 01:23:39,358
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, just from our perspective, if you, if you do have that one way circulation, it's, it's going to help.

818
01:23:39,438 --> 01:23:46,923
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause I think that creates a bit of a tight two way aisle over there, but it looks like you're going to be improving that area.

819
01:23:46,963 --> 01:23:48,123
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you.

820
01:23:52,086 --> 01:23:52,266
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

821
01:23:54,947 --> 01:23:58,469
[SPEAKER_08]: The hours of operation maybe you turn Desmond's question for you.

822
01:23:58,489 --> 01:24:00,711
[SPEAKER_08]: And I honestly don't know the answer.

823
01:24:00,731 --> 01:24:12,098
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you, do you think that that's part of the special permit that we are involved in or do you see that as entirely separate special permit that you need to get from city council directly.

824
01:24:13,287 --> 01:24:15,169
[SPEAKER_31]: So the hours of nine a.m.

825
01:24:15,229 --> 01:24:16,430
[SPEAKER_31]: to 11 p.m.

826
01:24:16,690 --> 01:24:18,591
[SPEAKER_31]: are permitted by the ordinance.

827
01:24:18,692 --> 01:24:28,360
[SPEAKER_31]: It would be the extended hours till midnight on the weekends, which will need an extended hours permit, special permit from the city council.

828
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:33,144
[SPEAKER_31]: And that can't be applied for until after the project is permitted.

829
01:24:33,584 --> 01:24:35,966
[SPEAKER_31]: So it's something that we have to do at a future date.

830
01:24:36,607 --> 01:24:40,069
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, unfortunate that it can't be wrapped up in this.

831
01:24:41,631 --> 01:24:41,831
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

832
01:24:48,769 --> 01:24:51,051
[SPEAKER_08]: That's probably all that I, I have right now.

833
01:24:52,172 --> 01:24:54,593
[SPEAKER_08]: Any other follow up questions from board members.

834
01:24:55,914 --> 01:24:56,315
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me know.

835
01:25:00,558 --> 01:25:09,284
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought that sounds like we're sort of in agreement on continuing this to a future date to give you some more time.

836
01:25:10,826 --> 01:25:17,991
[SPEAKER_08]: You being the cane, the canes team to, you know, update plans, meet with the city and so forth.

837
01:25:20,074 --> 01:25:27,229
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought that we probably as a board could at least address the two technical waivers that have been requested.

838
01:25:28,268 --> 01:25:41,020
[SPEAKER_08]: And those were the two requirements on the site plan itself, you mentioned the elevations, I'm looking for the citation I think it's 11.7.77.

839
01:25:41,721 --> 01:25:51,149
[SPEAKER_08]: There was a second one regarding elevations dimensions I guess they're both sort of dimensional in nature, but the other one is item 10.

840
01:25:51,930 --> 01:25:53,692
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that right attorney Desmond, do I am right.

841
01:25:54,678 --> 01:26:01,928
[SPEAKER_31]: Item 10 is the special permit and then that would be a recommendation to the city council on the loading area.

842
01:26:02,829 --> 01:26:11,019
[SPEAKER_31]: Oh, I'm talking about your elevation concerns I think that the two waivers on on that were elevations as to building.

843
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:27,202
[SPEAKER_31]: You faded out a waiver from 11.7 point seven that requires locations elevations and dimensions of existing and proposed buildings, and or other structures showing setbacks from the property lines.

844
01:26:28,123 --> 01:26:33,584
[SPEAKER_31]: And the basis for that request was that other than then Eastern Bank.

845
01:26:34,464 --> 01:26:40,285
[SPEAKER_31]: Well actually all of the buildings are existing buildings that have been in existence for a long period of time.

846
01:26:40,765 --> 01:26:43,489
[SPEAKER_31]: And they're all, you know, single story buildings for the most part.

847
01:26:44,771 --> 01:26:55,265
[SPEAKER_31]: And there's quite a few of them so it would be an expense to show the elevations as to all of those buildings where there isn't really anything that is good they're all single story buildings, for the most part.

848
01:26:56,746 --> 01:27:04,292
[SPEAKER_31]: And the second was 11.7 point 710, which requires existing and proposed contour elevations and one foot increments.

849
01:27:04,812 --> 01:27:08,775
[SPEAKER_31]: And again, this is just a redevelopment of a site that's already been developed.

850
01:27:09,775 --> 01:27:12,757
[SPEAKER_31]: So we're asking from a waiver from that requirement.

851
01:27:13,518 --> 01:27:17,300
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so if we could, as a board of other members are in agreement.

852
01:27:18,141 --> 01:27:23,865
[SPEAKER_08]: If we could vote on granting those two areas at least to give you that courtesy of that tonight.

853
01:27:27,089 --> 01:27:30,970
[SPEAKER_08]: and then the other matters would, I think, wait for your return visit.

854
01:27:33,070 --> 01:27:35,471
[SPEAKER_17]: Do we need to motion them separately or can we motion them together?

855
01:27:35,491 --> 01:27:39,292
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm okay with them together.

856
01:27:40,612 --> 01:27:41,932
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, I'll make the motion.

857
01:27:41,952 --> 01:27:44,633
[SPEAKER_08]: Seconded.

858
01:27:45,633 --> 01:27:46,313
[SPEAKER_08]: Seconded, okay.

859
01:27:46,873 --> 01:27:48,214
[SPEAKER_08]: And roll call vote.

860
01:27:49,174 --> 01:27:51,994
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll start with our vice chair, Jackie Furtado.

861
01:27:52,875 --> 01:27:53,015
[SPEAKER_29]: Aye.

862
01:27:54,155 --> 01:27:54,895
[SPEAKER_08]: Klyce Andresen.

863
01:27:56,298 --> 01:27:57,858
[SPEAKER_08]: I am Lee headman.

864
01:27:58,559 --> 01:28:00,259
[SPEAKER_08]: I get a call us.

865
01:28:01,139 --> 01:28:02,660
[SPEAKER_08]: I already government.

866
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:08,761
[SPEAKER_08]: I, and I'm also an eye so those two waivers are approved so you don't have to worry about that.

867
01:28:11,582 --> 01:28:12,202
[SPEAKER_08]: Should we talk.

868
01:28:13,283 --> 01:28:18,144
[SPEAKER_08]: Perhaps Amanda, is it time for us to talk about scheduling or what canes would like to do next.

869
01:28:20,303 --> 01:28:24,344
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think it could be worth raising while the group is all here.

870
01:28:24,404 --> 01:28:26,585
[SPEAKER_01]: That's very good of you.

871
01:28:27,105 --> 01:28:29,325
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.

872
01:28:29,786 --> 01:28:38,608
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I mean, we have a meeting scheduled next week, but I don't know if that's enough time for your team.

873
01:28:39,368 --> 01:28:40,948
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if it is, then great.

874
01:28:41,108 --> 01:28:43,009
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be on the third, so the Wednesday.

875
01:28:44,669 --> 01:28:46,610
[SPEAKER_01]: Would your team prefer more time?

876
01:28:48,743 --> 01:28:49,384
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe so.

877
01:28:50,686 --> 01:28:58,478
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll need to get more answers, I think, out of DCR and understand the traffic a little bit more.

878
01:28:58,578 --> 01:29:03,947
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a somewhat complex issue that we need to work through.

879
01:29:05,642 --> 01:29:13,046
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so we do have, because this isn't a public hearing, we do have the ability to do scheduling offline.

880
01:29:14,026 --> 01:29:19,409
[SPEAKER_01]: But just in terms of a temperature check, we meet twice a month, first and third Wednesdays.

881
01:29:20,329 --> 01:29:26,072
[SPEAKER_01]: So the third next week, and then the 17th are already on the calendar.

882
01:29:26,412 --> 01:29:31,895
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we also have, I think it's the 7th of June, and the

883
01:29:33,865 --> 01:29:34,486
[SPEAKER_01]: 21st of June.

884
01:29:35,006 --> 01:29:38,268
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are sort of the like near term meetings.

885
01:29:38,669 --> 01:29:47,635
[SPEAKER_01]: And if if your team had opinions about general ballpark, but I kind of feel like we can just figure it out offline.

886
01:29:50,357 --> 01:29:56,922
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm thinking the 17th, you'll have to weigh in on whether you think you can get the traffic wrapped up by them.

887
01:29:59,224 --> 01:30:08,427
[SPEAKER_33]: Yeah, I assume getting answers from DCR if we can do that, which I'll endeavor to do, 17 should be fine, provided Eric can do his work as well.

888
01:30:12,088 --> 01:30:12,628
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, great.

889
01:30:12,668 --> 01:30:15,889
[SPEAKER_01]: So that'll be a tentative yes, and we can follow up offline.

890
01:30:15,909 --> 01:30:19,290
[SPEAKER_20]: Excellent.

891
01:30:19,350 --> 01:30:21,491
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you for your attention to this matter.

892
01:30:21,511 --> 01:30:25,892
[SPEAKER_31]: We appreciate your input and your comments and we look forward to working with the city as always.

893
01:30:26,680 --> 01:30:27,280
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

894
01:30:27,340 --> 01:30:30,981
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for choosing Medford thanks for all the work you put into this tonight we appreciate it.

895
01:30:31,001 --> 01:30:32,161
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

896
01:30:36,683 --> 01:30:44,085
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, ready for our next item on the agenda the plan development district proposed for 100 Winchester Street.

897
01:30:45,365 --> 01:30:49,686
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is a first for us planned development district.

898
01:30:52,358 --> 01:31:16,607
[SPEAKER_08]: And those of you who followed along with the new zoning ordinance, and the discussions that took place as part of that process, you may be aware that this is new technique that developer and the city can engage in this process to identify a parcel of parcels some footprint that is

899
01:31:19,795 --> 01:31:20,355
[SPEAKER_08]: appropriate.

900
01:31:21,556 --> 01:31:27,200
[SPEAKER_08]: They believe for special or different type of zoning analysis.

901
01:31:28,481 --> 01:31:34,865
[SPEAKER_08]: The plan development district is something that requires an amendment to the zoning ordinance.

902
01:31:35,786 --> 01:31:39,708
[SPEAKER_08]: So our involvement the city council's involvement is called for there.

903
01:31:41,069 --> 01:31:48,197
[SPEAKER_08]: And then there's an approval process of whatever development might be actually planned within the district once the zoning ordinance has been amended.

904
01:31:48,917 --> 01:31:57,326
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's just my own little 32nd summary of what the PDD ordinance calls for.

905
01:31:57,806 --> 01:32:00,769
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're in the very first meeting of the very first stage.

906
01:32:01,824 --> 01:32:12,609
[SPEAKER_08]: But the focus tonight is to think about zoning amendment that would find its way from us to City Council for further consideration.

907
01:32:15,570 --> 01:32:16,730
[SPEAKER_08]: Amanda, how'd I do, is that all right?

908
01:32:18,191 --> 01:32:19,372
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, thank you very much.

909
01:32:20,392 --> 01:32:27,315
[SPEAKER_08]: So with that as background, let's bring on the team from 100 Winchester Street.

910
01:32:29,080 --> 01:32:32,621
[SPEAKER_24]: Hi, thank you, and good evening, Mr. Chairman, members of the board.

911
01:32:32,641 --> 01:32:33,842
[SPEAKER_24]: My name is Adam Barnoski.

912
01:32:33,862 --> 01:32:37,383
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm with the law firm of Roberto Israel and Weiner at 255 State Street.

913
01:32:37,923 --> 01:32:46,066
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm an attorney for 96-102 Winchester Street, LLC, the property owner and the proposed developer.

914
01:32:46,906 --> 01:32:53,489
[SPEAKER_24]: With me are the developers, Steve Nardone and Gerald Nardone, Peter Quinn and Milton New, the project architects.

915
01:32:55,122 --> 01:33:04,914
[SPEAKER_24]: Even Sawyer the engineer step on states traffic consultant, Katya Patsy although the landscaped architects and my co counsel, Michael Brown.

916
01:33:06,656 --> 01:33:11,540
[SPEAKER_24]: If I may, Mr Chairman, can I go through a brief overview of the project.

917
01:33:12,161 --> 01:33:27,395
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, we didn't want you to feel like you had to give every detail and, and, but again because we're sort of in the zoning phase of things but can't really appreciate what the PDD is without understanding what your ideas are for the site so absolutely please.

918
01:33:28,316 --> 01:33:29,036
[SPEAKER_24]: Sure, sure.

919
01:33:29,096 --> 01:33:30,878
[SPEAKER_24]: So, so as you mentioned, we are here.

920
01:33:34,009 --> 01:33:38,772
[SPEAKER_24]: plan development residential district under section 9.2 of the zoning ordinance.

921
01:33:39,493 --> 01:33:43,696
[SPEAKER_24]: At the outset, I'd like to say that, you know, we're all very excited about this project.

922
01:33:44,116 --> 01:33:45,337
[SPEAKER_24]: It's been a long time coming.

923
01:33:45,677 --> 01:33:50,421
[SPEAKER_24]: We've had a few meetings with with staff and with the community about this project.

924
01:33:51,061 --> 01:33:59,467
[SPEAKER_24]: And I'd like to thank planning, leadership and staff for for their part in helping us get to where we are tonight, which is a

925
01:33:59,487 --> 01:34:05,651
[SPEAKER_24]: essentially the first official meeting in what we hope to be a productive process here.

926
01:34:07,172 --> 01:34:11,975
[SPEAKER_24]: We do understand it's the first PDE so we're kind of all in this together at this point in time.

927
01:34:13,515 --> 01:34:20,980
[SPEAKER_24]: So, I wanted to provide you with a little bit of overview of zoning and the project and property and then pass it along to Peter Quinn to discuss some of the

928
01:34:21,100 --> 01:34:26,603
[SPEAKER_24]: design elements, we do understand that this is not, you know, a formal design review.

929
01:34:26,644 --> 01:34:34,568
[SPEAKER_24]: So we're going to try to keep this short, particularly in light of the last hearing and try to make it as palatable as we can for you.

930
01:34:35,769 --> 01:34:46,576
[SPEAKER_24]: If we could, while I'm giving my overview, if he's not already, could Peter Quinn be promoted to a co-host so he can share some of the photos in a few minutes?

931
01:34:48,297 --> 01:34:49,238
[SPEAKER_24]: So first of all, the property.

932
01:34:50,158 --> 01:34:56,384
[SPEAKER_24]: The proposed PDD site is located on the southern portion of Winchester Street, due east from the Ball Square T stop.

933
01:34:57,005 --> 01:35:02,210
[SPEAKER_24]: The site consists of three lots comprised of five tax parcels measuring just under 50,000 square feet.

934
01:35:04,635 --> 01:35:12,445
[SPEAKER_24]: The two lots located at 96-102 Winchester are contiguous through lots with frontage on Winchester and Alfred Streets.

935
01:35:13,026 --> 01:35:17,091
[SPEAKER_24]: They've been used for many years as a commercial space for offices and garaging.

936
01:35:17,732 --> 01:35:22,438
[SPEAKER_24]: The lot located at 104 is a corner lot with frontage on Winchester

937
01:35:24,657 --> 01:35:33,005
[SPEAKER_24]: a two-story residence that has been deemed preferably preserved by the Medford Historical Commission.

938
01:35:33,806 --> 01:35:39,752
[SPEAKER_24]: The site is mostly located in the general residential GR zoning district with a

939
01:35:44,213 --> 01:35:49,777
[SPEAKER_24]: the zoning table detailing the uses, dimensional requirements for the PDE was included in the application materials.

940
01:35:50,458 --> 01:35:52,719
[SPEAKER_24]: I'll get into a little bit more detail on that momentarily.

941
01:35:52,759 --> 01:35:58,724
[SPEAKER_24]: However, it's worth noting that the PDE was developed with a specific use and specific structures in mind.

942
01:35:59,304 --> 01:36:11,654
[SPEAKER_24]: And where in some instances, this board is going to see PDEs that could host a variety of configurations and uses, here, the zoning table was crafted with a particular project in mind.

943
01:36:12,214 --> 01:36:12,755
[SPEAKER_24]: And as such,

944
01:36:15,443 --> 01:36:17,204
[SPEAKER_24]: in this project.

945
01:36:17,344 --> 01:36:22,605
[SPEAKER_24]: First, relative to the uses, they're identified in exhibit E of our submission.

946
01:36:22,625 --> 01:36:32,829
[SPEAKER_24]: And we believe that these are in line with the other uses allowed in the area, that is, it's primarily residential with ancillary low-impact commercial.

947
01:36:34,007 --> 01:36:35,629
[SPEAKER_24]: And second, the dimensional requirements.

948
01:36:36,270 --> 01:36:52,669
[SPEAKER_24]: We've identified those in Exhibit F of the submission intended to blend with the underlying district's requirements with modifications to accommodate the scale of the project without disrupting the neighborhood and to allow room to modify if needed during the permitting process at different

949
01:36:56,045 --> 01:37:15,368
[SPEAKER_24]: As currently drafted, the PDD zoning has proposed heights in line with recent developments in the area and along Broadway, setbacks similar to existing conditions of neighboring properties, below-grade parking in excess of the current requirements, and reasonable open space and lot coverage requirements for the area.

950
01:37:16,166 --> 01:37:25,894
[SPEAKER_24]: In the broader, much broader context, the PDD is intended to create a gradual transition between the C1 zoning district and the GR zoning district.

951
01:37:28,076 --> 01:37:30,578
[SPEAKER_24]: As I mentioned, while it's primarily located in the GR, there are

952
01:37:33,722 --> 01:37:34,923
[SPEAKER_24]: in the C1 as well.

953
01:37:35,563 --> 01:37:46,169
[SPEAKER_24]: And the commercial district, particularly along Broadway, is becoming typified by mixed-use developments, multifamily developments, and a continuation of commercial uses.

954
01:37:46,609 --> 01:38:03,298
[SPEAKER_24]: So we think that this PDD, as we're structuring the zoning, fits in with the broader transitioning of this neighborhood and the city, particularly in relation to the district's proximity to the GLX and Ball Square T Station.

955
01:38:08,123 --> 01:38:18,612
[SPEAKER_24]: development of the site I want to provide just a general overview of what the developer would be looking to build in the effect that the PDD is approved by the city.

956
01:38:19,352 --> 01:38:26,818
[SPEAKER_24]: So the development would consist of a four story 65 unit residential building with below grade parking, a two

957
01:38:29,367 --> 01:38:31,649
[SPEAKER_24]: building, and a community pocket park.

958
01:38:32,490 --> 01:38:42,580
[SPEAKER_24]: This would be located within the new PD with a portion of the block bound by which Winchester Street to the west, a little higher to the north New Bern Avenue, Alfred Street to the east and Albion Street.

959
01:38:44,666 --> 01:39:04,672
[SPEAKER_24]: development would raise the existing structures on the site with a new four-story residential building measuring approximately 63,000 square feet, 65 residential units on the first through fourth floors, 51 parking spaces below grade, 56 long-term bicycle parking spaces, a roof

960
01:39:04,672 --> 01:39:07,794
[SPEAKER_24]: roof dock and rooftop solar arrays.

961
01:39:08,414 --> 01:39:18,801
[SPEAKER_24]: The existing structure at 104 would be fully restored, and a new addition would be added to the rear to form an L-shaped building, measuring approximately 4,000 square feet.

962
01:39:19,181 --> 01:39:22,823
[SPEAKER_24]: This would be that ancillary light commercial space.

963
01:39:23,844 --> 01:39:32,169
[SPEAKER_24]: The use table we're seeking to craft into the PDD would allow daycare, office, gym, or similar use.

964
01:39:33,890 --> 01:39:39,011
[SPEAKER_24]: A 104 would also be improved with a pocket park for public use with new landscaping, hardscaping and benches.

965
01:39:39,852 --> 01:39:48,754
[SPEAKER_24]: I recognize that we've been kind of going through some of the plans as I've been speaking, but I would like to pass it along to Peter at this time if you'd like to elaborate on the design.

966
01:39:51,215 --> 01:39:51,855
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes, good evening.

967
01:39:51,895 --> 01:39:56,937
[SPEAKER_25]: My name is Peter Quinn, Peter Quinn Architects, 259 Elm Street in Davis Square, Somerville.

968
01:40:00,556 --> 01:40:03,725
[SPEAKER_25]: The site has a couple of features that I think are worth pointing out.

969
01:40:05,012 --> 01:40:08,833
[SPEAKER_25]: from an architect or land planner's point of view, are particularly interesting.

970
01:40:09,353 --> 01:40:15,314
[SPEAKER_25]: First, of course, the site has frontage on three sides, which means it has a lot of frontage.

971
01:40:16,054 --> 01:40:21,435
[SPEAKER_25]: And each of those sides presents a different set of design challenges.

972
01:40:22,895 --> 01:40:31,837
[SPEAKER_25]: Secondly, the site slopes approximately 15 feet from the Winchester Albion corner up here.

973
01:40:33,438 --> 01:40:37,640
[SPEAKER_25]: where my cursor is, all the way down to the lowest point on Alfred Street.

974
01:40:38,380 --> 01:40:52,127
[SPEAKER_25]: So we'll be in our massing to put more of the mass of the building toward Winchester Street and then step it down with the grade on Alfred.

975
01:40:52,147 --> 01:40:55,068
[SPEAKER_25]: As you'll see when we go into the building plan a little bit.

976
01:40:57,170 --> 01:41:00,152
[SPEAKER_25]: So yeah, we have two principal structures on a single lot.

977
01:41:00,192 --> 01:41:05,455
[SPEAKER_25]: That's part of our zoning applications to allow that within this particular new district.

978
01:41:06,455 --> 01:41:07,736
[SPEAKER_25]: One is a residential building.

979
01:41:07,756 --> 01:41:08,937
[SPEAKER_25]: There's a commercial building.

980
01:41:09,577 --> 01:41:18,462
[SPEAKER_25]: You could think of it as a master plan, but that's not built in necessarily into the PVD.

981
01:41:19,263 --> 01:41:24,986
[SPEAKER_25]: We also are, as mentioned, have, I will just add a couple of things that

982
01:41:26,766 --> 01:41:31,110
[SPEAKER_25]: Adam didn't cover in terms of what some of the features of the building.

983
01:41:31,210 --> 01:41:34,813
[SPEAKER_25]: It's fully handicapped accessible from the garage all the way to the roof.

984
01:41:35,794 --> 01:41:41,318
[SPEAKER_25]: And it's about at this point, we are proposing 15% affordable.

985
01:41:41,939 --> 01:41:42,820
[SPEAKER_25]: That's 10 units.

986
01:41:44,001 --> 01:41:48,925
[SPEAKER_25]: So that's a fairly significant amount of affordable units for this project.

987
01:41:49,949 --> 01:42:16,841
[SPEAKER_25]: And the commercial building, as I said, as was said, not only will provide some commercial space close to the other commercial development along Broadway, but it also means a restoration of the front part of the existing building, which has some historic content and is definitely worth restoring if we can figure out a way to make it work economically when we think we have.

988
01:42:19,466 --> 01:42:38,299
[SPEAKER_25]: The other aspect of the commercial that's worth pointing out is that there's a beautiful tree that sits right, you know, about 15, 20 feet away from the existing building, and we intend to preserve that and create a kind of an active courtyard around it for the commercial users.

989
01:42:41,381 --> 01:42:47,365
[SPEAKER_25]: And then finally, some other things about the site before I start to show you some images of the building.

990
01:42:49,157 --> 01:42:55,239
[SPEAKER_25]: The site itself is developed so that it has multiple, it's primarily pedestrian oriented.

991
01:42:55,279 --> 01:42:58,139
[SPEAKER_25]: It has multiple entry points for pedestrians.

992
01:42:58,999 --> 01:43:04,521
[SPEAKER_25]: Here, for instance, for the commercial use, where my cursor is, a little pocket park that was mentioned.

993
01:43:05,121 --> 01:43:10,622
[SPEAKER_25]: And when we present the landscape, perhaps next time, we can go into that in some detail.

994
01:43:11,142 --> 01:43:15,903
[SPEAKER_25]: There's a lot of entry, formal entry to the front of the commercial building.

995
01:43:16,678 --> 01:43:27,005
[SPEAKER_25]: And then a through walk that is private, but it does allow residents of the building to walk along the entire length of the site.

996
01:43:27,766 --> 01:43:33,070
[SPEAKER_25]: And then we have our formal entry for the building itself right off Winchester Street.

997
01:43:33,890 --> 01:43:37,753
[SPEAKER_25]: And we made a real effort to get cars off the site as much as possible.

998
01:43:37,833 --> 01:43:44,338
[SPEAKER_25]: So we have a single driveway that's two way that leads down to an underground garage.

999
01:43:45,157 --> 01:44:00,045
[SPEAKER_25]: The rise itself is on two different levels, each separated by about four or five feet, allowing an upper level to be built where the grade is higher, and then as we get closer to Alfred, it steps down.

1000
01:44:01,606 --> 01:44:04,768
[SPEAKER_25]: We also have an area for trash and recycling.

1001
01:44:04,828 --> 01:44:08,050
[SPEAKER_25]: This is an enclosed building that's an appendage to the main building.

1002
01:44:09,310 --> 01:44:12,592
[SPEAKER_25]: A few other things that are worth mentioning, I think.

1003
01:44:16,255 --> 01:44:38,448
[SPEAKER_25]: The landscape architect, Rodant, has made a real effort to gracefully delineate all the facades, all the street furnitures with nice plantings, primarily, as will be explained in time, with native plants or plants that are adapted for

1004
01:44:39,328 --> 01:44:40,670
[SPEAKER_25]: um, urban conditions.

1005
01:44:41,571 --> 01:44:57,672
[SPEAKER_25]: And so you see that, um, well, Winchester Street turns for Albion and then, of course, on Alfred, we're introducing some very nice, um, landscaping integrated with some of the trees that are existing there.

1006
01:45:00,885 --> 01:45:18,454
[SPEAKER_25]: In our building, of course, there's been a lot of talk about going all electric and net zero, and that is our intention at this point, but we still have to deal with making a final decision based on economics and availability of electricity and the extent of available power in the area.

1007
01:45:19,830 --> 01:45:22,331
[SPEAKER_25]: but we certainly will pre-wire for electric cars.

1008
01:45:23,192 --> 01:45:41,181
[SPEAKER_25]: And in addition to the 56 or so bike spaces that were mentioned, they're in a secure bike room that has a, you know, we'll have a repair shop in it, a repair bench, and outwash, bike washing component.

1009
01:45:41,361 --> 01:45:46,884
[SPEAKER_25]: We also are able to park bikes above the cars, you know, and probably be

1010
01:45:49,492 --> 01:45:50,752
[SPEAKER_25]: So that's the intention.

1011
01:45:50,832 --> 01:45:55,494
[SPEAKER_25]: Let me show you some nice images of the building.

1012
01:45:55,514 --> 01:46:10,059
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't want to go into the design too much because I know we're primarily here about the zoning, but you can see this gives you a good overview from the corner, Winchester being on the left here, and then

1013
01:46:11,452 --> 01:46:14,435
[SPEAKER_25]: Albion is just off to the right, the pocket park is shown there.

1014
01:46:15,596 --> 01:46:25,248
[SPEAKER_25]: This doesn't have all the trees in place because we want to be able to see the buildings, but it does give you an idea of how that existing building is restored.

1015
01:46:27,346 --> 01:46:32,168
[SPEAKER_25]: the front and windows are restored and then kind of a contemporary addition on the back.

1016
01:46:32,288 --> 01:46:35,230
[SPEAKER_25]: It's fairly simple, not trying to upstage the old house.

1017
01:46:36,170 --> 01:46:41,273
[SPEAKER_25]: And then because of the grades, we're actually able to have a raised patio around that tree.

1018
01:46:41,913 --> 01:46:43,634
[SPEAKER_25]: It sits higher than the street as it is.

1019
01:46:43,654 --> 01:46:48,196
[SPEAKER_25]: And so that would be an active courtyard with commercial users.

1020
01:46:48,496 --> 01:46:49,457
[SPEAKER_25]: It's a very nice feature.

1021
01:46:50,497 --> 01:46:52,679
[SPEAKER_25]: To the left, you see the new building.

1022
01:46:53,220 --> 01:46:56,782
[SPEAKER_25]: This is the four stories that we have on Winchester Street.

1023
01:46:56,822 --> 01:47:01,566
[SPEAKER_25]: However, we set back the fourth story to reduce the apparent mass of the building.

1024
01:47:02,467 --> 01:47:09,453
[SPEAKER_25]: We also introduced a strong cornice in keeping with the idea that a lot of the older buildings in the neighborhood do have cornices.

1025
01:47:10,293 --> 01:47:19,661
[SPEAKER_25]: And we introduced balconies at the corners and along the sides in order to break up the massing of the building at the eye level.

1026
01:47:21,512 --> 01:47:37,023
[SPEAKER_25]: You can see that the building is built on a kind of a plinth, and that is actually the underground garage that is bigger than the footprint of the residential structure itself.

1027
01:47:38,064 --> 01:47:44,008
[SPEAKER_25]: And so what we have here is like a brick structure, or there'll be a concrete structure with a brick face.

1028
01:47:44,709 --> 01:47:49,212
[SPEAKER_25]: And then the terraces that would be created around

1029
01:47:55,619 --> 01:47:59,281
[SPEAKER_25]: so that we've also offset the building from front to rear.

1030
01:47:59,361 --> 01:48:10,045
[SPEAKER_25]: The further distance that you see here is the Alfred part of the building, so that this gives the building a little bit of variety visually.

1031
01:48:10,185 --> 01:48:12,766
[SPEAKER_25]: This is an opportunity to break the mass furthest.

1032
01:48:13,707 --> 01:48:14,907
[SPEAKER_25]: You can see the driveway.

1033
01:48:14,927 --> 01:48:16,728
[SPEAKER_25]: This is a two-way drive on the left here.

1034
01:48:17,570 --> 01:48:18,811
[SPEAKER_25]: digging down to the garage.

1035
01:48:19,512 --> 01:48:21,274
[SPEAKER_25]: Plenty of room, it's 24 feet wide.

1036
01:48:21,875 --> 01:48:27,080
[SPEAKER_25]: And then at the end of that is the recycling center and trash collection.

1037
01:48:29,983 --> 01:48:33,547
[SPEAKER_25]: This is a view from Alfred's green seat here.

1038
01:48:33,587 --> 01:48:38,512
[SPEAKER_25]: What we've done is we've maintained a similar appearance to the building, but we've set the building for the

1039
01:48:40,615 --> 01:48:42,015
[SPEAKER_25]: building to three stories.

1040
01:48:42,295 --> 01:48:54,559
[SPEAKER_25]: And the purpose of this, of course, is to give Alfred Street a better sense of scale that's appropriate for Alfred Street, which is primarily one and two family residential.

1041
01:48:55,099 --> 01:49:02,241
[SPEAKER_25]: Then we further broke the mass of this into a townhouse-like form so that we can

1042
01:49:07,753 --> 01:49:11,934
[SPEAKER_25]: present a nice residential scale to the community there.

1043
01:49:12,354 --> 01:49:20,116
[SPEAKER_25]: There's actually no entry to the building on this side, except for if you're a resident, you can go on that through path and enter that way.

1044
01:49:22,737 --> 01:49:32,820
[SPEAKER_25]: This drive that you see on the right here is actually for fire access, and it has a minimal amount of paving, the rest is

1045
01:49:35,386 --> 01:49:39,588
[SPEAKER_25]: grass pavers or landscaping on the left side of it.

1046
01:49:41,929 --> 01:49:46,211
[SPEAKER_25]: Another view from Malfrey, looking back toward Winchester.

1047
01:49:46,571 --> 01:49:51,413
[SPEAKER_25]: The fences that you see on the left side are for the private residents that get around Albion.

1048
01:49:54,434 --> 01:50:05,019
[SPEAKER_25]: An aerial view similar to the street view that we had at the beginning, looking down into the courtyard of the commercial space and then the larger residential structures.

1049
01:50:06,054 --> 01:50:06,194
[SPEAKER_25]: Um.

1050
01:50:07,375 --> 01:50:09,536
[SPEAKER_25]: Surrounded by landscape wherever we could get it.

1051
01:50:12,457 --> 01:50:13,237
[SPEAKER_25]: Another view of that.

1052
01:50:14,318 --> 01:50:16,059
[SPEAKER_25]: All four corners provided.

1053
01:50:16,079 --> 01:50:20,361
[SPEAKER_25]: This is Alfred looking out over those houses there.

1054
01:50:21,281 --> 01:50:28,725
[SPEAKER_25]: By setting it back quite a bit in landscaping, and I think it does integrate very well with the scale of this street's neighborhood.

1055
01:50:30,105 --> 01:50:30,625
[SPEAKER_25]: Streetscape.

1056
01:50:33,367 --> 01:50:34,047
[SPEAKER_25]: And one last view.

1057
01:50:35,398 --> 01:50:37,921
[SPEAKER_25]: I'll leave it at that, and I'm happy to take any questions.

1058
01:50:38,001 --> 01:50:44,067
[SPEAKER_25]: And as Adam mentioned, we also have our landscape architect with us here, as well as civil engineer and traffic consultant.

1059
01:50:46,549 --> 01:50:46,870
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

1060
01:50:49,512 --> 01:50:50,193
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Mr. Quinn.

1061
01:50:59,492 --> 01:51:03,433
[SPEAKER_08]: Adam, do you want to turn more to the zoning side of things at this point?

1062
01:51:03,494 --> 01:51:07,235
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to interrupt your proposed presentation, but... Sure.

1063
01:51:07,275 --> 01:51:23,821
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, so we provided the... I mean, the zoning is essentially a mix of proposed uses and dimensional requirements that we have under the exhibits.

1064
01:51:23,881 --> 01:51:26,942
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, we can walk through each of those if you'd like to.

1065
01:51:26,962 --> 01:51:28,763
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm not sure how granular you want to get,

1066
01:51:30,754 --> 01:51:31,835
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure, let me.

1067
01:51:32,835 --> 01:51:35,838
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanted to invite whatever presentation you wanted to say on that.

1068
01:51:35,918 --> 01:51:36,058
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1069
01:51:36,078 --> 01:51:43,423
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, I mean that was generally I know that the board has these I you know I had has the has the submission.

1070
01:51:44,583 --> 01:51:52,509
[SPEAKER_24]: And, and it's, you know, as we discussed most of the dimensional requirements under the zoning basically allowed this.

1071
01:51:53,625 --> 01:51:58,368
[SPEAKER_24]: development by, not by right, but by special permit to the city council.

1072
01:51:58,428 --> 01:52:03,990
[SPEAKER_24]: So, you know, we tried to provide setbacks that allow some, some of a buffer.

1073
01:52:04,151 --> 01:52:14,636
[SPEAKER_24]: So we're now like within, you know, riding up against the setbacks, same with height, same with FAR and all the different elements that we have under the zoning code.

1074
01:52:15,376 --> 01:52:18,958
[SPEAKER_24]: And like I said, I'm happy to get as granular as you like.

1075
01:52:19,018 --> 01:52:22,640
[SPEAKER_24]: I think that, you know, overall the tables kind of speak for themselves.

1076
01:52:24,800 --> 01:52:42,700
[SPEAKER_24]: And that result really is what you're seeing here I mean there's the way that we've crafted the zoning tables and the uses that are allowed essentially are going to permit what you're seeing here, so it's primarily residential, there are light ancillary

1077
01:52:43,621 --> 01:52:45,202
[SPEAKER_24]: commercial uses that are allowed.

1078
01:52:45,323 --> 01:52:56,911
[SPEAKER_24]: But, you know, for example, it would be able to put this PDD through and build a seven story 400 unit complex here.

1079
01:52:56,991 --> 01:52:58,893
[SPEAKER_24]: So we tried to tailor it.

1080
01:52:58,973 --> 01:53:05,297
[SPEAKER_24]: So again, so we might be able to make a few modifications based on input by the board.

1081
01:53:05,317 --> 01:53:11,542
[SPEAKER_24]: But overall, we're pretty much working within the confines to allow this by special permit of the city council.

1082
01:53:13,088 --> 01:53:13,749
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, thank you.

1083
01:53:14,969 --> 01:53:29,701
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we also have with us, attorney Jonathan Silverstein who is acting as counsel to the board to help advise us as we go through the process of recommending the amended ordinance.

1084
01:53:31,202 --> 01:53:33,063
[SPEAKER_08]: Presumably also advising the city council.

1085
01:53:34,144 --> 01:53:36,346
[SPEAKER_08]: Jonathan, would you like to say hello or.

1086
01:53:37,406 --> 01:53:55,675
[SPEAKER_08]: Jump in you'll recognize Jonathan from previous appearances before the board he's helped us with things like sort of our internal con management and board operations and some of the statutes that affect planning boards generally so good evening.

1087
01:53:58,256 --> 01:53:59,456
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, can everyone hear me okay.

1088
01:54:00,037 --> 01:54:01,217
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we can hear you.

1089
01:54:01,237 --> 01:54:01,477
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1090
01:54:01,497 --> 01:54:01,777
[SPEAKER_08]: Perfect.

1091
01:54:02,598 --> 01:54:02,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

1092
01:54:03,718 --> 01:54:04,779
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you, Mr. Chair.

1093
01:54:06,289 --> 01:54:15,316
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think obviously this is the first PDD that the board's being presented under the new ordinance.

1094
01:54:16,157 --> 01:54:31,308
[SPEAKER_02]: And as you indicated in your preparatory remarks, it really, the PDD presents a nice opportunity for tailored zoning for specific developments.

1095
01:54:31,328 --> 01:54:34,471
[SPEAKER_02]: And as Mr. Barnofsky indicated,

1096
01:54:36,137 --> 01:54:44,644
[SPEAKER_02]: A PDD can be a tool to paint with a broader brush for sort of a master planning exercise.

1097
01:54:46,265 --> 01:54:47,926
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not what's really presented here.

1098
01:54:48,007 --> 01:54:53,551
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a much more narrow in scope development on a smaller site.

1099
01:54:53,571 --> 01:55:02,258
[SPEAKER_02]: And this project, a lot of the legwork has been done up front by staff and by the applicant.

1100
01:55:03,144 --> 01:55:08,285
[SPEAKER_02]: to bring to the board a really almost fully formed proposal.

1101
01:55:08,885 --> 01:55:29,870
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this hearing is really an opportunity for you to, for the board to provide comment and get questions asked with respect to the intersection of the project with the proposed zoning.

1102
01:55:30,898 --> 01:55:34,741
[SPEAKER_02]: as Mr. Barnosky indicated, the zoning is really a means to an end.

1103
01:55:35,782 --> 01:55:43,868
[SPEAKER_02]: And so though normally when you're holding a hearing on a proposed zoning amendment, you're not considering specific projects.

1104
01:55:45,089 --> 01:55:48,932
[SPEAKER_02]: By its nature, PDD zoning is project specific zoning.

1105
01:55:49,433 --> 01:55:57,579
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this can be an opportunity for the board to ask any questions, provide feedback so that

1106
01:55:58,675 --> 01:56:21,546
[SPEAKER_02]: if changes need to be considered, they're being considered now rather than when you get to the point of your hearing under the State Zoning Act, chapter four, section five, by which point the zoning has been pretty much finalized and is gonna be

1107
01:56:22,220 --> 01:56:24,361
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to be making a recommendation to the council.

1108
01:56:25,442 --> 01:56:31,946
[SPEAKER_02]: And really changing course at that point presents more of a logistical challenge than it would now.

1109
01:56:32,446 --> 01:56:36,809
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I'm not suggesting that you're going to be looking to change course, but this is sort of that opportunity.

1110
01:56:38,090 --> 01:56:46,415
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess that's the way I would explain my view of the most useful way to consider tonight's hearing.

1111
01:56:46,935 --> 01:56:48,896
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, I'm happy to answer any questions you may have.

1112
01:56:50,497 --> 01:56:51,158
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

1113
01:56:52,074 --> 01:56:53,895
[SPEAKER_08]: And, yep, and I see.

1114
01:56:54,636 --> 01:57:17,129
[SPEAKER_08]: Director hunts hand is up you're exactly where I was going next we're thinking alike, because it is different in that it is a recommendation to amend zoning so the city has a perspective here and so I imagine director hunt you're going to help offer the city's view on on this and the benefits that may offer to the, to the, to the city so please.

1115
01:57:18,225 --> 01:57:20,486
[SPEAKER_12]: And I also just wanted to make sure that it was clear.

1116
01:57:20,566 --> 01:57:24,007
[SPEAKER_12]: It's probably clear to the board what the process is here, but this is new.

1117
01:57:24,067 --> 01:57:28,769
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know we have people online and who may be watching this on TV.

1118
01:57:30,090 --> 01:57:40,714
[SPEAKER_12]: At the end of this hearing, this meeting, there will be the zoning, the table and the map will go to the city council as a zoning change.

1119
01:57:41,634 --> 01:57:44,035
[SPEAKER_12]: So this is our opportunity to recommend that.

1120
01:57:44,535 --> 01:58:12,447
[SPEAKER_12]: however the way zoning is then adopted this will go to the city council they will then immediately refer it back to this board for another public hearing on this exact same zoning um and then this board will make any additional comments and refer it back to the city council for a public hearing where they would then vote to adopt the zoning um in this case this is a very well developed project and honestly we we've been talking how

1121
01:58:12,907 --> 01:58:15,831
[SPEAKER_12]: this seems like there's a few extra too many meetings in this.

1122
01:58:15,871 --> 01:58:17,533
[SPEAKER_12]: We're still figuring out this process.

1123
01:58:18,014 --> 01:58:24,682
[SPEAKER_12]: If this was a less well-developed project, that might be useful.

1124
01:58:24,942 --> 01:58:26,043
[SPEAKER_12]: We're working through that.

1125
01:58:27,369 --> 01:58:36,120
[SPEAKER_12]: Once that zoning is adopted by the council, this project then comes back for a site plan review because of the size of the project.

1126
01:58:36,200 --> 01:58:38,763
[SPEAKER_12]: So this is not site plan review, but that would occur.

1127
01:58:39,143 --> 01:58:43,328
[SPEAKER_12]: Or let me just say once the zoning is adopted, they will apply for a building permit.

1128
01:58:43,849 --> 01:58:57,922
[SPEAKER_12]: And when they apply for the building permits, then this project comes back for site plan review, and any further building permits and I believe actually the council issues the permit under it then goes back to counsel again.

1129
01:58:58,603 --> 01:59:04,729
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, so I just wanted to be clear that this project is going to be in front of, sorry, it'll be a special permit.

1130
01:59:06,490 --> 01:59:09,492
[SPEAKER_12]: So it'll go back and forth and be in front of this board several times.

1131
01:59:10,592 --> 01:59:12,293
[SPEAKER_12]: And I wanted people to be aware of that.

1132
01:59:12,813 --> 01:59:15,255
[SPEAKER_12]: This is the easiest time to make big changes.

1133
01:59:15,815 --> 01:59:23,919
[SPEAKER_12]: If when it came back to you next time to when it's referred back to the council and the board wanted to make any significant changes.

1134
01:59:24,579 --> 01:59:29,782
[SPEAKER_12]: It would then have to be re advertised and re heard by the planning board like it gets a very complicated them.

1135
01:59:31,261 --> 01:59:33,182
[SPEAKER_12]: So this is the point to make conversation.

1136
01:59:33,202 --> 01:59:43,908
[SPEAKER_12]: I will say that we have been meeting with this applicant Mr Nardone for more than a year probably two years we've seen various iterations of this.

1137
01:59:44,509 --> 01:59:54,054
[SPEAKER_12]: Peter Quinn is a well respected architect that our board has worked with on this project and we've seen other projects by him over the years or my office has seen many projects by him.

1138
01:59:56,015 --> 01:59:58,176
[SPEAKER_12]: We think this is a great addition to the area.

1139
01:59:58,776 --> 02:00:01,337
[SPEAKER_12]: Planners will talk about the missing middle housing.

1140
02:00:01,357 --> 02:00:11,081
[SPEAKER_12]: And our housing production plan talks about the missing middle, which is sort of like, in some sense, this might be a little on the large size for that.

1141
02:00:11,141 --> 02:00:14,183
[SPEAKER_12]: That might be more like 10, 30 units.

1142
02:00:14,263 --> 02:00:15,683
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is 65.

1143
02:00:16,123 --> 02:00:19,505
[SPEAKER_12]: But this is not a high rise apartment building, right?

1144
02:00:19,585 --> 02:00:22,086
[SPEAKER_12]: This is a community scale building.

1145
02:00:23,446 --> 02:00:24,406
[SPEAKER_12]: We really like this.

1146
02:00:24,487 --> 02:00:26,047
[SPEAKER_12]: We like the low energy of it.

1147
02:00:26,107 --> 02:00:29,788
[SPEAKER_12]: We love that they came to us with solar, that they're trying to go all electric.

1148
02:00:30,288 --> 02:00:36,290
[SPEAKER_12]: We love the adaptive reuse of the building that they're keeping on site and the addition of a pocket park.

1149
02:00:36,790 --> 02:00:42,552
[SPEAKER_12]: I like that they keep saying that maybe daycare there, the city needs more of that.

1150
02:00:43,392 --> 02:00:46,853
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll take this opportunity to encourage that yet again.

1151
02:00:46,873 --> 02:00:50,094
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is very close to

1152
02:00:51,707 --> 02:00:53,567
[SPEAKER_12]: the some of the new T stops.

1153
02:00:54,007 --> 02:00:59,889
[SPEAKER_12]: And so we think this is a great location for more housing like this and for dense housing.

1154
02:01:01,049 --> 02:01:13,131
[SPEAKER_12]: So from the perspective of process, and then from the the building, you know, we've, we love that we like, I mean, obviously, y'all will have discussion and there'll be site plan review.

1155
02:01:13,651 --> 02:01:18,072
[SPEAKER_12]: But this is a good fit for the city and meets the needs of our housing production plan.

1156
02:01:20,432 --> 02:01:26,974
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much for the background on the process and also the city's voice on the, on the project much appreciated.

1157
02:01:28,974 --> 02:01:32,295
[SPEAKER_08]: Amanda, do we were going to the public on this one are we not.

1158
02:01:34,596 --> 02:01:40,377
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, this is a public hearing so we should at some point open to the public.

1159
02:01:41,670 --> 02:01:41,970
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1160
02:01:43,732 --> 02:01:47,454
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe that's appropriate this time to to solicit some input.

1161
02:01:48,495 --> 02:02:02,084
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we need to see the tables and talk about some of the zoning details but if we can have the public if there are folks who are interested want to comment on the overall process and the overall project, it would be nice to hear from them.

1162
02:02:05,467 --> 02:02:06,888
[SPEAKER_04]: Steve Coutinho again could I speak.

1163
02:02:09,106 --> 02:02:12,347
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, if you could just share once more your address for the record.

1164
02:02:12,867 --> 02:02:17,689
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm 85, I'm the representative of my aunt, 8587 Albion Street.

1165
02:02:18,549 --> 02:02:19,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome again.

1166
02:02:20,710 --> 02:02:31,293
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, I mean, I'm going to be honest with you, my family's owned the house for about 100 years now, just about on Albion Street.

1167
02:02:31,873 --> 02:02:37,375
[SPEAKER_04]: So of course, you probably know that this was a project back in the 70s, that Mr. Collegian, the farmer owner,

1168
02:02:38,467 --> 02:02:41,894
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to do something in the back as well, and all the neighbors opposed it.

1169
02:02:42,395 --> 02:02:43,537
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm not here to oppose it.

1170
02:02:43,577 --> 02:02:44,599
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a beautiful project.

1171
02:02:45,965 --> 02:03:07,682
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, my concern would be like with the 65 units, you know, given like the new T station there's a lot more pedestrian trap pedestrian traffic, in addition to the amazing student population at Tufts University who live on Albion Street with the traffic, you know, then people pulling in and out of, out of the driveway I'd be concerned with that.

1172
02:03:09,743 --> 02:03:13,224
[SPEAKER_04]: But more importantly, a couple of things come to mind.

1173
02:03:13,284 --> 02:03:18,385
[SPEAKER_04]: When they started digging for the T, we had a bad rat problem and mice problem, which I never had before.

1174
02:03:19,145 --> 02:03:21,206
[SPEAKER_04]: And what's going to happen with that?

1175
02:03:21,326 --> 02:03:25,247
[SPEAKER_04]: Because these buildings and the house at the corner has been there forever.

1176
02:03:25,347 --> 02:03:26,607
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not been utilized.

1177
02:03:27,807 --> 02:03:29,068
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure there's mice in there.

1178
02:03:29,768 --> 02:03:32,228
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never seen a rat until the T project.

1179
02:03:32,348 --> 02:03:34,129
[SPEAKER_04]: And in that area, not even a mouse.

1180
02:03:35,449 --> 02:03:54,221
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, once the T project is like brutal, I saw dead ones in my yard, live ones, you know, so I just want to make sure that all those problems are going to be, you know, thought of, you know, I think, you know, it shouldn't be a cost for us because last time with the T, the city said that we had to pay for certain things.

1181
02:03:54,942 --> 02:04:00,085
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, to go through this again, it was like brutal, you know, like holes in the yard, rats and, you know, the whole bit.

1182
02:04:02,932 --> 02:04:13,320
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you know, like, my concern, you know, like, we've, you know, we've been lucky to have the privacy all these years with nobody in the back sitting on your deck or in the yard.

1183
02:04:13,340 --> 02:04:17,664
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I don't know, the 65 units is too much for the area.

1184
02:04:18,715 --> 02:04:21,658
[SPEAKER_04]: know, but I love the design, the architecture and all that.

1185
02:04:22,479 --> 02:04:34,873
[SPEAKER_04]: And then what I'd like to also ask is, you know, again, with the alley that we use all that that path, what's going to happen with that again, that we use now for our backyards?

1186
02:04:35,894 --> 02:04:37,296
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that going to stay intact?

1187
02:04:37,376 --> 02:04:39,058
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we still going to be able to use that land?

1188
02:04:47,107 --> 02:04:52,197
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know that I have the answer for you, Mr Catino but we could ask someone on the project team.

1189
02:04:55,075 --> 02:05:10,504
[SPEAKER_24]: Sure, so are you referring to the backyard that, like the backyards that are currently utilizing a portion of the project property?

1190
02:05:10,524 --> 02:05:11,905
[SPEAKER_24]: Is that what you're referring to?

1191
02:05:11,925 --> 02:05:18,549
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I thought that it was a land that was donated to the city many years ago when the bonds were there.

1192
02:05:18,569 --> 02:05:21,991
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I heard that those bonds were used for,

1193
02:05:24,093 --> 02:05:28,515
[SPEAKER_04]: horses or cows or something like that, you know, from milk cows, you know, so my grandfather told me.

1194
02:05:29,355 --> 02:05:39,460
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's land in between the houses on Albion Street until they hit the, you know, the structures on your project.

1195
02:05:40,938 --> 02:05:43,901
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm like what I call is that called one place or.

1196
02:05:44,322 --> 02:05:59,798
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, yeah, there is an area called long place what I will say is that the, the air there is a there is a portion of property if you look at the survey you can see this so there is this portion of property called long place that I believe is.

1197
02:06:04,439 --> 02:06:04,979
[SPEAKER_24]: property.

1198
02:06:05,440 --> 02:06:13,613
[SPEAKER_24]: And you can see, you can see by what's up on the screen there that like for example, there's a shed that crosses that property line.

1199
02:06:14,547 --> 02:06:29,634
[SPEAKER_24]: And it's the intent of the developers to leave that area untouched by this, that they don't plan on retaking that lawn place for their own use.

1200
02:06:29,834 --> 02:06:38,898
[SPEAKER_24]: So that if you, and if you, I'm not sure if that's Peter or Milton that has that, but could you bring up the following, a drawing that shows the,

1201
02:06:39,938 --> 02:06:47,240
[SPEAKER_24]: the proposed development on top of the survey plan, so you can kind of see what that's going to look like.

1202
02:06:48,160 --> 02:06:50,841
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, so if you see, you can see law in place there.

1203
02:06:50,881 --> 02:06:51,561
[SPEAKER_24]: You just had it.

1204
02:06:52,181 --> 02:06:53,261
[SPEAKER_24]: You might be able to see it here.

1205
02:06:53,741 --> 02:06:57,402
[SPEAKER_24]: And so you can see that that does remain undisturbed.

1206
02:06:58,723 --> 02:07:01,203
[SPEAKER_04]: So would we still be using the land or not?

1207
02:07:05,883 --> 02:07:12,046
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, as far as the development goes, it's not like, yeah, this is a very, can you see that on your screen, sir?

1208
02:07:14,928 --> 02:07:15,828
[SPEAKER_25]: I can explain that.

1209
02:07:15,988 --> 02:07:18,509
[SPEAKER_25]: This is the property line right here where my cursor is.

1210
02:07:19,010 --> 02:07:19,890
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, thank you, Peter.

1211
02:07:20,470 --> 02:07:27,814
[SPEAKER_25]: And then there's approximately 15 feet of encroachment that is on our client's property.

1212
02:07:28,749 --> 02:07:37,756
[SPEAKER_25]: but the idea is that the fence that is there will be rebuilt and continued access will be provided to those owners on Albion Street.

1213
02:07:39,077 --> 02:07:40,978
[SPEAKER_25]: That you'll be able to do what for the owners?

1214
02:07:42,099 --> 02:07:43,540
[SPEAKER_25]: You can continue to use it.

1215
02:07:44,160 --> 02:07:44,621
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

1216
02:07:44,661 --> 02:07:52,046
[SPEAKER_25]: So as you have it, but it's, it's not, we're still, we need that land for our total lot area.

1217
02:07:53,728 --> 02:07:54,188
[SPEAKER_04]: For your what?

1218
02:07:55,567 --> 02:08:13,174
[SPEAKER_24]: lot area for the lot area so that there might so there might be some further discussions with with the owners on that on that strip but it is again the intent of the developer to not build on the area that's being utilized by by those properties.

1219
02:08:13,855 --> 02:08:16,716
[SPEAKER_04]: So what will it be used for then?

1220
02:08:16,836 --> 02:08:20,898
[SPEAKER_25]: As I said it's used it's used by the the Albion residents.

1221
02:08:22,992 --> 02:08:26,455
[SPEAKER_04]: So are they going to keep it open or are they going to put a fence in the back or?

1222
02:08:27,435 --> 02:08:29,477
[SPEAKER_04]: Six foot high privacy fence.

1223
02:08:30,077 --> 02:08:33,840
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, so six foot and it's like, you know, the 15 feet.

1224
02:08:35,301 --> 02:08:38,143
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, beyond, just as it is now.

1225
02:08:38,844 --> 02:08:40,405
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll continue to use the land.

1226
02:08:40,425 --> 02:08:40,505
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1227
02:08:40,785 --> 02:08:41,986
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1228
02:08:43,067 --> 02:08:43,327
[SPEAKER_04]: And then.

1229
02:08:47,943 --> 02:08:50,765
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, again, you know, like I said, I love the project.

1230
02:08:50,825 --> 02:08:57,469
[SPEAKER_04]: And can you explain to me again what the outcome of that 104 Winchester is?

1231
02:08:59,210 --> 02:09:02,372
[SPEAKER_04]: So I see, you know, you refixed the structure, you're adding to it.

1232
02:09:02,552 --> 02:09:04,033
[SPEAKER_04]: And then what is it going to be used for again?

1233
02:09:05,335 --> 02:09:08,756
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, we're trying to determine what the best use for that is.

1234
02:09:08,816 --> 02:09:14,597
[SPEAKER_24]: I think ideally, you know, it's been brought up that a daycare could be used or possibly a gym.

1235
02:09:16,297 --> 02:09:33,540
[SPEAKER_24]: What we've done in just bringing it back to the zoning table, what we've tried to do is to allow any uses that are allowed by right in the subject zone, in the base zoning districts, the C and the GR to be allowed, but

1236
02:09:35,267 --> 02:09:41,850
[SPEAKER_24]: I think the idea of what everyone seems to be interested in is one of the uses that I've specified.

1237
02:09:41,890 --> 02:09:45,612
[SPEAKER_24]: So this project is significant.

1238
02:09:46,892 --> 02:09:52,735
[SPEAKER_24]: There's a significant amount of time that's going to pass between when it's approved and when it's built, then once you have tenants.

1239
02:09:52,795 --> 02:09:55,676
[SPEAKER_24]: So there's been no use that's been committed to it just yet.

1240
02:09:57,217 --> 02:10:03,520
[SPEAKER_04]: Then are these going to be, again, I kind of missed part of it, are they going to be condos or are they going to be apartments?

1241
02:10:05,262 --> 02:10:05,983
[SPEAKER_04]: that people rent?

1242
02:10:06,003 --> 02:10:11,767
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know if that's been, Peter, do you have an answer on that one?

1243
02:10:11,787 --> 02:10:19,493
[SPEAKER_25]: My understanding it's apartments, but it could be condos, it's a market condition thing.

1244
02:10:19,573 --> 02:10:21,654
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, that can also change over time.

1245
02:10:22,135 --> 02:10:24,376
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so you're not sure if you'll be selling them or renting?

1246
02:10:25,818 --> 02:10:27,339
[SPEAKER_24]: Not yet, not at this point.

1247
02:10:30,475 --> 02:10:35,397
[SPEAKER_25]: If I may, through the chair, just mention, see the fences behind the Albion residence.

1248
02:10:36,057 --> 02:10:37,378
[SPEAKER_25]: This is a six-by-five fence.

1249
02:10:38,759 --> 02:10:51,064
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so that's going to be all still part of what, you know, the Albion Street portion used in the past, and there's going to be a lane back there for the tenants to go, but that would be on the other side of the fence?

1250
02:10:51,564 --> 02:10:52,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, exactly.

1251
02:10:52,524 --> 02:10:53,825
[SPEAKER_25]: So you maintain your privacy as

1252
02:10:55,193 --> 02:10:58,376
[SPEAKER_25]: course, you have a building there now, but you would have a fence.

1253
02:10:58,776 --> 02:10:59,477
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, right.

1254
02:11:00,798 --> 02:11:13,108
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, yeah, and then again, like I said, you know, big concern is like with the rat population, and you know, once you start digging, what's going to happen, you know, so I don't know if there's any answer to that at this time.

1255
02:11:13,128 --> 02:11:16,050
[SPEAKER_25]: I'll just say that

1256
02:11:16,548 --> 02:11:20,330
[SPEAKER_25]: Typically, in order to get a billing permit, you have to have a rat mitigation program.

1257
02:11:21,030 --> 02:11:21,250
[SPEAKER_25]: Right.

1258
02:11:21,851 --> 02:11:23,932
[SPEAKER_25]: Probably something the MBTA didn't think about.

1259
02:11:24,532 --> 02:11:24,752
[SPEAKER_25]: Right.

1260
02:11:25,572 --> 02:11:27,353
[SPEAKER_04]: So you'd have a program in place.

1261
02:11:27,393 --> 02:11:29,474
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I own another piece of property in Everett.

1262
02:11:30,375 --> 02:11:38,879
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's kind of the same thing happened, but like the new developer, anytime I have a problem, he sends somebody over there.

1263
02:11:38,919 --> 02:11:40,279
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not coming out of my pocket.

1264
02:11:40,299 --> 02:11:41,320
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

1265
02:11:42,182 --> 02:11:44,024
[SPEAKER_04]: So that would be similar to this.

1266
02:11:44,124 --> 02:11:46,166
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be a contact that we can call.

1267
02:11:46,186 --> 02:11:47,968
[SPEAKER_04]: The city's not going to say pay for it yourself.

1268
02:11:50,608 --> 02:12:11,747
[SPEAKER_08]: My understanding is that the, the Board of Health of the city weighs in on that sort of stuff in connection with the issuance of the building permit so they have plans for you know the waste and the trash and, and other controls erosion controls and rodents that sort of thing is all part of the city's review of a proposed development closer to that building permit.

1269
02:12:12,313 --> 02:12:12,493
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

1270
02:12:12,593 --> 02:12:12,954
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1271
02:12:12,974 --> 02:12:32,337
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, you know, on the record, you know, whenever, but I mean, I really need to, you know, like to see something that's going to be available for, you know, the residents in the area, because like I said, it was horrible when you never well, you're never used to seeing them and you see them all the time at that point, you know, but I think it's subsided, but I'm not sure if they're still underground.

1272
02:12:34,088 --> 02:12:42,995
[SPEAKER_01]: If I might jump in, I just want to make sure that we refocus the conversation, definitely recognizing the concerns that you're raising, Stephen.

1273
02:12:43,315 --> 02:12:49,300
[SPEAKER_01]: And there will be multiple opportunities, I think, a little bit later down the line as we talk more about the project itself.

1274
02:12:49,740 --> 02:12:54,303
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's permitting attached to this pathway.

1275
02:12:55,204 --> 02:12:59,127
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is actually more about the zoning implications for the project.

1276
02:12:59,507 --> 02:13:00,908
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope that that clarifies things.

1277
02:13:00,928 --> 02:13:01,649
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1278
02:13:02,069 --> 02:13:07,714
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, then again that the last piece I would say is, you know, is it too many apartments for that area.

1279
02:13:08,796 --> 02:13:11,378
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, I'll leave it at that for you to consider.

1280
02:13:13,160 --> 02:13:16,403
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I appreciate you giving me the opportunity to speak.

1281
02:13:17,223 --> 02:13:17,644
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.

1282
02:13:17,664 --> 02:13:18,765
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for your input today.

1283
02:13:19,345 --> 02:13:19,686
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1284
02:13:20,947 --> 02:13:24,030
[SPEAKER_08]: Amanda, do we have other members of the public who'd like to participate.

1285
02:13:24,450 --> 02:13:24,931
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.

1286
02:13:26,392 --> 02:13:26,953
[SPEAKER_03]: Could I speak.

1287
02:13:28,690 --> 02:13:32,513
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, if you could just share your name and address for the record, please.

1288
02:13:33,033 --> 02:13:33,334
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

1289
02:13:33,574 --> 02:13:38,238
[SPEAKER_03]: It's John Carroll and I'm at 35.

1290
02:13:38,918 --> 02:13:43,061
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm at 35 Clayton and it's Clayton Avenue, not Clayton Street.

1291
02:13:44,923 --> 02:13:47,585
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe I share a driveway with Mr. Nadoni.

1292
02:13:49,210 --> 02:14:02,877
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I, uh, was a little surprised by, I think it's director Hunter's tone, um, seemed rather presumptuous and overly positive.

1293
02:14:02,957 --> 02:14:07,840
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds like it's already green lighted and without any public input.

1294
02:14:08,320 --> 02:14:11,642
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's just taken aback by her, uh, her.

1295
02:14:12,095 --> 02:14:13,415
[SPEAKER_03]: presumptuousness, I guess.

1296
02:14:14,976 --> 02:14:17,556
[SPEAKER_03]: I will not rehash the rat problem.

1297
02:14:17,916 --> 02:14:27,658
[SPEAKER_03]: I know we understand that we've already had a couple of years of significant excavation construction with the Green Line.

1298
02:14:28,178 --> 02:14:34,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Your underground parking, I think, is going to be another major noise issue.

1299
02:14:35,740 --> 02:14:35,980
[SPEAKER_03]: there.

1300
02:14:36,041 --> 02:14:37,962
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, I worry about the rats.

1301
02:14:38,082 --> 02:14:44,046
[SPEAKER_03]: I worry about the utilities in terms of water being used.

1302
02:14:44,187 --> 02:14:45,808
[SPEAKER_03]: Is our water pressure going to change?

1303
02:14:46,808 --> 02:14:58,557
[SPEAKER_03]: But most importantly, it feels like an encroachment because we're on the Alfred side, and we've had the privilege of having that kind of blocked off.

1304
02:15:00,603 --> 02:15:05,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Opening that up is gonna change the little enclave that we have over here.

1305
02:15:06,044 --> 02:15:07,704
[SPEAKER_03]: It is all residential housing.

1306
02:15:08,164 --> 02:15:16,186
[SPEAKER_03]: The parking, my sense is that the parking is gonna get worse over here on the side streets.

1307
02:15:16,266 --> 02:15:21,887
[SPEAKER_03]: Our visitors, our guests aren't gonna be able to have the availability that we have right now.

1308
02:15:23,747 --> 02:15:28,928
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have a lot of concerns and I think, did I see a roof deck up there as well?

1309
02:15:32,443 --> 02:15:32,883
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody?

1310
02:15:33,643 --> 02:15:35,044
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes, did.

1311
02:15:35,884 --> 02:15:36,424
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1312
02:15:36,484 --> 02:15:38,645
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's fully screened up here.

1313
02:15:39,545 --> 02:15:40,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Fully screened.

1314
02:15:41,106 --> 02:15:41,346
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1315
02:15:41,806 --> 02:15:42,526
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's open.

1316
02:15:44,107 --> 02:15:48,868
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, you know, we're in Tufts area university.

1317
02:15:49,008 --> 02:15:51,129
[SPEAKER_03]: I can just hear frat parties up there at night.

1318
02:15:53,050 --> 02:15:54,230
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a lot of concerns.

1319
02:15:58,529 --> 02:16:20,239
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, we certainly appreciate your participation tonight and as we've mentioned and many of us have mentioned that this is just one of the first step in a process which does include the city council on a couple of different occasions and you may find, you know, you can obviously share your concerns, not only with this board but also with your elected representatives as well so.

1320
02:16:20,839 --> 02:16:25,341
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, and could you just clarify director hunch's position, I'm sorry I didn't catch that.

1321
02:16:26,586 --> 02:16:31,427
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, I'm the Director of Planning, Economic Development and Sustainability.

1322
02:16:32,428 --> 02:16:39,409
[SPEAKER_12]: There have actually been at least one public community meeting on this project, but it was quite a while ago.

1323
02:16:39,469 --> 02:16:44,191
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if the applicant or one of the staff remembers when that was.

1324
02:16:44,711 --> 02:16:46,751
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there was one a while ago.

1325
02:16:46,771 --> 02:16:49,292
[SPEAKER_03]: It was also very short notice.

1326
02:16:49,592 --> 02:16:51,813
[SPEAKER_03]: As this was too, I think we got 48 hours notice.

1327
02:17:00,480 --> 02:17:03,801
[SPEAKER_24]: That meeting was just for the record, that was August 29th, 2022.

1328
02:17:04,641 --> 02:17:13,463
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, that's all I have for right now.

1329
02:17:13,563 --> 02:17:16,143
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, we've been on the call since 630.

1330
02:17:17,764 --> 02:17:24,585
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a long night, and I wish we had more of an opportunity to discuss this and hear from some of the other neighbors.

1331
02:17:26,982 --> 02:17:28,462
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, thank you for your input.

1332
02:17:29,023 --> 02:17:34,704
[SPEAKER_08]: Amanda, can you tell us, are there perhaps some other neighbors who are waiting to weigh in or other residents?

1333
02:17:36,525 --> 02:17:40,246
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, would anyone, you can raise your hand with the react button.

1334
02:17:40,466 --> 02:17:48,168
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use the chat function just to, if you need any help getting unmuted or you can unmute yourself and offer a comment.

1335
02:17:49,928 --> 02:17:50,128
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry.

1336
02:17:55,818 --> 02:17:56,999
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not seeing anyone here.

1337
02:17:57,019 --> 02:18:04,985
[SPEAKER_01]: I am going to just quickly check our email, refresh the page.

1338
02:18:05,486 --> 02:18:08,188
[SPEAKER_01]: But we didn't receive comments ahead of the meeting.

1339
02:18:09,469 --> 02:18:10,349
[SPEAKER_01]: And no new emails.

1340
02:18:11,770 --> 02:18:12,031
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

1341
02:18:14,993 --> 02:18:23,960
[SPEAKER_08]: So with the focus tonight on zoning, oh, I should say, with the public period closed at this point, if we don't have anyone else out there,

1342
02:18:25,871 --> 02:18:32,194
[SPEAKER_08]: Are there members of the board who want to say something now just in terms of the overall project.

1343
02:18:33,574 --> 02:18:43,558
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the next thing we'll do is turn to the table of uses and the actual specifics to see what our feelings are about the zoning amendment but are there any comments at this point.

1344
02:18:44,299 --> 02:18:44,699
[SPEAKER_08]: General.

1345
02:18:50,962 --> 02:18:54,463
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean I have comments David I don't know if you want me to wait or not I wasn't.

1346
02:18:55,290 --> 02:19:08,897
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, well what I thought, if it's just sort of like hey, how do you feel about the project, I, that's sort of what I'm calling for and I'm thinking that we would turn next and actually look at the real nuts and bolts of the zoning amendment.

1347
02:19:09,377 --> 02:19:11,358
[SPEAKER_08]: So, depends on what you'd like to say.

1348
02:19:11,378 --> 02:19:15,520
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, can wait if you want, whatever.

1349
02:19:16,541 --> 02:19:17,901
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I mean I can go ahead.

1350
02:19:18,182 --> 02:19:19,862
[SPEAKER_18]: I think, um, please.

1351
02:19:19,882 --> 02:19:24,845
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, parking ratio.

1352
02:19:27,248 --> 02:19:31,249
[SPEAKER_18]: What are you proposing for parking ratio for this project?

1353
02:19:33,230 --> 02:19:37,032
[SPEAKER_18]: And how does it compare to standard?

1354
02:19:38,393 --> 02:19:46,617
[SPEAKER_25]: So it is compliant with the new bylaw, which states the ratios for

1355
02:19:47,773 --> 02:19:51,054
[SPEAKER_25]: market rate and for affordable units, definitely.

1356
02:19:52,195 --> 02:20:00,037
[SPEAKER_25]: So we, you know, I think we actually have a spacer to the spare under that ratio, under that guideline.

1357
02:20:01,358 --> 02:20:01,798
[SPEAKER_18]: Which is?

1358
02:20:04,119 --> 02:20:12,282
[SPEAKER_25]: Let's see, off the top of my head, I think it's 0.8 for the market rate and 0.5 per unit for the affordable.

1359
02:20:13,502 --> 02:20:14,262
[SPEAKER_18]: For a total of? 51.

1360
02:20:17,910 --> 02:20:23,814
[SPEAKER_25]: I think 50 is actually what you need, probably at 50.

1361
02:20:24,134 --> 02:20:31,098
[SPEAKER_18]: Does the parking occupy the entirety of the subgrade level under the building?

1362
02:20:32,039 --> 02:20:34,140
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, there's a bike room, there's utility rooms.

1363
02:20:35,581 --> 02:20:36,281
[SPEAKER_25]: But generally?

1364
02:20:36,862 --> 02:20:37,062
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah.

1365
02:20:37,462 --> 02:20:43,966
[SPEAKER_25]: Just to give you an idea here, this is the lower parking level.

1366
02:20:45,840 --> 02:20:52,763
[SPEAKER_25]: So you come down, the center of the building is where the elevator is to navigate between the different levels of the building.

1367
02:20:53,343 --> 02:20:57,084
[SPEAKER_25]: There's a bike room down there, there's a large electrical room, what's the need.

1368
02:20:58,305 --> 02:21:05,988
[SPEAKER_25]: And then parking for the 26 in this garage, you can go up.

1369
02:21:07,748 --> 02:21:11,030
[SPEAKER_25]: There's another parking garage when you first come in here, there's 25.

1370
02:21:12,891 --> 02:21:15,192
[SPEAKER_25]: So you, okay, it's like a split level parking garage.

1371
02:21:15,252 --> 02:21:16,113
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes, exactly.

1372
02:21:16,533 --> 02:21:17,774
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay.

1373
02:21:21,476 --> 02:21:28,960
[SPEAKER_18]: I, I think, I think it's a nice project.

1374
02:21:28,980 --> 02:21:37,024
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it's, I think it's nice that you scaled it appropriately to the neighborhood.

1375
02:21:39,207 --> 02:21:43,911
[SPEAKER_18]: and use the step back to really sort of respect that scale.

1376
02:21:43,931 --> 02:21:50,356
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't have any real comments on the architecture.

1377
02:21:51,137 --> 02:22:05,329
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it's a little curious, and maybe you can talk through this a little bit, that you haven't used that facade along Alfred Street to

1378
02:22:07,802 --> 02:22:32,591
[SPEAKER_18]: to sort of make the same moves that you have on the front, or maybe a better way to say that is, it seems like a missed opportunity to create a more neighborhood friendly interaction with Alfred Street, like with some entries and things like that.

1379
02:22:33,964 --> 02:22:48,184
[SPEAKER_18]: I know that's not to maybe exactly how these kind of buildings work, but it does seem a little strange that there's no sort of entry piece on this side that's sort of engaging Alfred Street.

1380
02:22:49,968 --> 02:23:03,037
[SPEAKER_12]: Can I sorry I hate to interrupt, but we have another hearing tonight and this is going very long can we really restrict our site plan review comments to when we have site plan review and really focus on the big picture and the zoning.

1381
02:23:03,418 --> 02:23:08,882
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm very sorry it's it's nine o'clock and there's another hearing after this.

1382
02:23:10,223 --> 02:23:10,683
[SPEAKER_18]: That's fine.

1383
02:23:10,863 --> 02:23:17,468
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I mean, I was a little confused by the by the description of

1384
02:23:18,657 --> 02:23:23,301
[SPEAKER_18]: The series of meetings because you said if anything is going to change it has to be brought up now.

1385
02:23:23,722 --> 02:23:28,646
[SPEAKER_12]: The zoning needs to change the zoning would be tonight.

1386
02:23:30,043 --> 02:23:41,769
[SPEAKER_12]: The site plan will actually be after they apply for building permits, which is a whole nother thing so if it's anything in the zoning that needs to be changed, that needs to be tonight.

1387
02:23:42,229 --> 02:23:53,254
[SPEAKER_12]: Anything about the facade the layout the plantings all our typical site plan things that will have a site plan review on sorry I, I know it gets very, we've been very confused about the process.

1388
02:23:54,035 --> 02:23:54,155
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

1389
02:23:54,175 --> 02:23:56,716
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, well then I'll just let it keep going.

1390
02:23:59,669 --> 02:24:00,169
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks, guys.

1391
02:24:00,649 --> 02:24:02,370
[SPEAKER_08]: Ari, I see your hand up.

1392
02:24:04,270 --> 02:24:04,951
[SPEAKER_27]: Great, thank you.

1393
02:24:05,351 --> 02:24:14,133
[SPEAKER_27]: I had the opportunity to visit the site and do a tour with the property owner and developer, along with Amanda.

1394
02:24:16,526 --> 02:24:21,691
[SPEAKER_27]: My impression after that tour is that it seems very thought out.

1395
02:24:21,791 --> 02:24:36,104
[SPEAKER_27]: I have kind of some things that I want to bring up when we get to site review in terms of details, but in terms of the big picture, it's a much larger lot than it's looked like when I've driven past it a million times.

1396
02:24:37,586 --> 02:24:41,429
[SPEAKER_27]: The height seems like it should fit the neighborhood, and while

1397
02:24:42,150 --> 02:24:45,092
[SPEAKER_27]: The nature of having more housing is that there's less privacy.

1398
02:24:45,252 --> 02:24:46,933
[SPEAKER_27]: We also desperately need more housing.

1399
02:24:47,414 --> 02:25:01,383
[SPEAKER_27]: And I thought, and I think the very dense one and two bedrooms right near the T is a really smart move for giving people space to live in our community.

1400
02:25:01,603 --> 02:25:04,085
[SPEAKER_27]: So I think that the scale makes sense to me.

1401
02:25:06,627 --> 02:25:07,047
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Ari.

1402
02:25:10,342 --> 02:25:15,407
[SPEAKER_08]: Any other comments on the board here you had your hand up at one point but all good.

1403
02:25:15,808 --> 02:25:21,894
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm good for now I may have things to say and come say plan review but as for zoning things on restrict that to zoning.

1404
02:25:24,958 --> 02:25:31,545
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so who would like to take the lead then on helping us to focus on the specific zoning

1405
02:25:33,089 --> 02:25:51,393
[SPEAKER_24]: Sure, Mr. Chairman, so I would say if you have, if the board has the submission in front of them, we can look at, I think I'll briefly go through the table of uses, and then I'll pass it to my co-counsel Michael Barone to talk about the dimensional requirements.

1406
02:25:51,433 --> 02:25:57,114
[SPEAKER_24]: But if you look at exhibit E, it spells out the proposed

1407
02:26:01,636 --> 02:26:08,660
[SPEAKER_24]: This is our draft, we will have to work with any recommendations the board will have to work with Attorney Silverstein.

1408
02:26:14,493 --> 02:26:16,054
[SPEAKER_24]: to the zoning ordinance.

1409
02:26:17,895 --> 02:26:20,357
[SPEAKER_24]: And so it might look different than what it looks like here.

1410
02:26:20,438 --> 02:26:37,992
[SPEAKER_24]: But essentially what we've done is we thought at the outset to pull in because the site is located in the GR and the C1 to go through and say that anything that's allowed by right in those zoning districts, we would put into allowing it by right under the PDD.

1411
02:26:38,032 --> 02:26:42,255
[SPEAKER_24]: So we just tried to take, so that's why if you look at exhibit E,

1412
02:26:43,316 --> 02:26:47,937
[SPEAKER_24]: you can see that there's a column for GR, there's a column for C1, and there's a column for PDD.

1413
02:26:48,117 --> 02:26:50,938
[SPEAKER_24]: So basically, if it's allowed, and either of those have made it allowed.

1414
02:26:51,438 --> 02:26:54,719
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, that being said... Adam, if I could just interrupt you, sorry.

1415
02:26:54,759 --> 02:26:57,400
[SPEAKER_08]: Amanda, is it possible for you to pop that on the screen for us?

1416
02:26:57,420 --> 02:27:01,541
[SPEAKER_08]: I think my associate Milton can do that too.

1417
02:27:01,841 --> 02:27:02,161
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1418
02:27:02,181 --> 02:27:03,222
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be great.

1419
02:27:03,262 --> 02:27:03,762
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1420
02:27:03,982 --> 02:27:04,662
[SPEAKER_25]: That'd be super.

1421
02:27:04,962 --> 02:27:07,463
[SPEAKER_25]: Can you just make Milton view presenter, please?

1422
02:27:19,141 --> 02:27:32,881
[SPEAKER_24]: So in going through these, you'll note that there is a difference between what is going to be or what we've proposed to be in the PDD in terms of uses.

1423
02:27:34,856 --> 02:27:46,468
[SPEAKER_24]: opposed to what we actually plan to, to build the developer plans to build here so to the extent that you would be in the board's purview or the city council purview to scale back some of the uses.

1424
02:27:47,048 --> 02:27:58,640
[SPEAKER_24]: Certainly, we'd be willing to do that, but the thought again is not to try to prejudice this property by limiting uses that might otherwise be allowed by right

1425
02:28:00,742 --> 02:28:10,167
[SPEAKER_24]: example, you have a museum, a community use which is a museum use that's allowed by right under our PDD.

1426
02:28:10,187 --> 02:28:12,469
[SPEAKER_24]: Now that's because it's allowed in the C1.

1427
02:28:12,489 --> 02:28:17,732
[SPEAKER_24]: There's no intent to use this as a museum use, but we're trying again not to prejudice the site.

1428
02:28:17,792 --> 02:28:25,256
[SPEAKER_24]: So if you can go through now, Milton, I think, could you could you bring up the actual zoning table of uses?

1429
02:28:26,136 --> 02:28:27,257
[SPEAKER_24]: Looks like you're under the dimensional

1430
02:28:30,735 --> 02:28:30,916
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I see.

1431
02:28:30,936 --> 02:28:32,600
[SPEAKER_11]: I see what you're saying.

1432
02:28:32,640 --> 02:28:32,921
[SPEAKER_11]: One second.

1433
02:28:33,703 --> 02:28:34,044
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure.

1434
02:28:35,387 --> 02:28:38,194
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you do, if you could zoom in a little bit, that would be great.

1435
02:29:04,300 --> 02:29:06,962
[SPEAKER_24]: So it's another, yeah, it's another set.

1436
02:29:07,622 --> 02:29:20,692
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, so this, yeah, this is a little bit different Milton, I think that we, there's actually an exhibit that we have in here that has, it's basically an amendment to 312, which is the key table of use regulations.

1437
02:29:21,692 --> 02:29:25,595
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, I see, that wasn't in my... That's not in your deck, okay.

1438
02:29:25,755 --> 02:29:25,996
[SPEAKER_24]: No.

1439
02:29:26,916 --> 02:29:27,717
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, well, I mean,

1440
02:29:34,644 --> 02:29:36,545
[SPEAKER_24]: if the board staff has that available.

1441
02:29:36,565 --> 02:29:42,747
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you talking about the one in your names?

1442
02:29:45,968 --> 02:29:47,808
[SPEAKER_24]: It was exhibit E on the submission.

1443
02:29:47,828 --> 02:29:49,269
[SPEAKER_24]: It was the zoning table of use.

1444
02:29:50,409 --> 02:29:55,311
[SPEAKER_24]: The zoning table of use is with the GR, the C1, and the PDD listed on there.

1445
02:29:56,531 --> 02:29:58,011
[SPEAKER_12]: Amanda, do you want me to share that?

1446
02:29:59,192 --> 02:30:01,252
[SPEAKER_12]: I have that up on my screen if that's helpful.

1447
02:30:01,533 --> 02:30:02,373
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be great.

1448
02:30:02,533 --> 02:30:02,913
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1449
02:30:03,772 --> 02:30:04,112
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1450
02:30:04,212 --> 02:30:04,573
[SPEAKER_25]: Thanks.

1451
02:30:12,781 --> 02:30:13,801
[SPEAKER_25]: Great, thank you very much.

1452
02:30:14,302 --> 02:30:28,055
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, so, so this is a, it's a three page or sorry, it's, it's, it's about, it's a few pages long if you go through it and basically go what it does is it goes

1453
02:30:30,008 --> 02:30:31,288
[SPEAKER_24]: in the zoning table.

1454
02:30:31,828 --> 02:30:39,750
[SPEAKER_24]: So we've gone through and allowed by right any uses that are allowed by right in either of the underlying base zoning districts.

1455
02:30:40,550 --> 02:30:50,592
[SPEAKER_24]: So again, the purpose here is to not prejudice any of the uses, but the intent is to permit what you have before you.

1456
02:30:50,672 --> 02:30:55,713
[SPEAKER_24]: So again, we're amenable to having comments from the board and if there's

1457
02:30:58,091 --> 02:31:00,235
[SPEAKER_24]: again I'll give the museum use for example.

1458
02:31:00,495 --> 02:31:10,090
[SPEAKER_24]: If there's any interest in restricting those uses I think we'd be happy to do so because the uses that we are looking to utilize are

1459
02:31:14,998 --> 02:31:21,260
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me interrupt and to ask a question again I know this is awkward because we don't really have our procedures down, this being the first go.

1460
02:31:22,001 --> 02:31:35,145
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe attorney Silverstein, is this like, should we be getting board comments at this point on very specifics yes or nos for each box or is that going to be a follow on meeting.

1461
02:31:35,965 --> 02:31:39,847
[SPEAKER_08]: After you've had a chance to work on the proposed amendment.

1462
02:31:41,848 --> 02:31:42,148
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

1463
02:31:44,828 --> 02:31:48,711
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't wanna waste everyone's time, but I also don't wanna miss the right time to give input, so.

1464
02:31:51,754 --> 02:32:09,048
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, so I would say that what, in terms of the changes that I think you'd wanna make now, it would be changes that would really dramatically change the scope of what would go into the zoning.

1465
02:32:09,891 --> 02:32:29,810
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think what you don't want to have happen is a zoning amendment goes to the council, gets referred to the CDB for your traditional public hearing, and then you find yourself wanting to make recommendations that would substantially change the scope of the amendment.

1466
02:32:30,512 --> 02:32:47,976
[SPEAKER_02]: tinkering with the table of uses, changing a Y to a CC or an N, that would all be within the scope of something you would expect to see when you hold that sort of public hearing and make recommendations.

1467
02:32:49,017 --> 02:32:50,217
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, let's say,

1468
02:32:52,207 --> 02:32:57,149
[SPEAKER_02]: the board were to decide, you know what, we really don't want residential on this site.

1469
02:32:57,569 --> 02:32:59,230
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd rather see life sciences.

1470
02:33:00,750 --> 02:33:03,471
[SPEAKER_02]: Life sciences is not allowed, residential is.

1471
02:33:03,531 --> 02:33:11,354
[SPEAKER_02]: We want a residential use to be prohibited and life sciences to be allowed.

1472
02:33:12,275 --> 02:33:14,636
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's larger,

1473
02:33:16,612 --> 02:33:23,339
[SPEAKER_02]: higher level scope of really changing the direction of things that you would want to discover now.

1474
02:33:24,640 --> 02:33:37,693
[SPEAKER_02]: Fine tuning the language is something that you would traditionally do through recommendations to the council when it comes back to you on an actual formal amendment, if that makes sense.

1475
02:33:38,735 --> 02:33:40,777
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that does make sense I think that's helpful.

1476
02:33:41,418 --> 02:33:55,771
[SPEAKER_08]: I just know my experience as a board member I think this board works really well when we have a fresh set of eyes and we put it in out on the table we put it on the screen and we kind of go through each one together and we come out with a pretty good process that worked during the zoning amendment.

1477
02:33:57,331 --> 02:33:58,032
[SPEAKER_08]: back and forth.

1478
02:33:58,832 --> 02:34:01,413
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't know.

1479
02:34:01,453 --> 02:34:05,254
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm feeling like maybe this could be our next meeting.

1480
02:34:05,294 --> 02:34:10,855
[SPEAKER_08]: We could put this on the board and really get it down to where we have specific recommendations from the board to go forward.

1481
02:34:13,076 --> 02:34:14,816
[SPEAKER_08]: Would that make sense?

1482
02:34:15,036 --> 02:34:19,938
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to be an obstacle to allowing this to go to the next level when it's ready.

1483
02:34:20,761 --> 02:34:28,329
[SPEAKER_12]: And I want sorry I can't find my raise hand with my screen shared, I just wanted to ask a process question of the attorney as well.

1484
02:34:29,050 --> 02:34:36,399
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, it seems to me there's two perspectives on this right now and one is that allow everything that's allowed because.

1485
02:34:38,323 --> 02:34:56,119
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't want to further restricted for any future development in the long future, but it is my understanding that with the PDP, you have to exercise your rights under this change zoning within two years you have to get a building permit and and get started.

1486
02:34:56,699 --> 02:35:08,922
[SPEAKER_12]: which would imply to me that 40 years from now, if they want to use something else, this is not actually the zoning, it reverts back to the underlying zoning.

1487
02:35:09,622 --> 02:35:11,222
[SPEAKER_12]: Do we know, is that correct?

1488
02:35:11,282 --> 02:35:16,683
[SPEAKER_12]: Because in that case, in my mind, we wouldn't want a large table like this.

1489
02:35:17,083 --> 02:35:25,265
[SPEAKER_12]: We would want only like the five things, the 10 things they think they might do in the next two years, simplify all of this.

1490
02:35:26,717 --> 02:35:28,817
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, are you able to speak to that?

1491
02:35:30,078 --> 02:35:30,318
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

1492
02:35:30,338 --> 02:35:32,038
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so.

1493
02:35:32,058 --> 02:35:36,359
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a good point.

1494
02:35:36,999 --> 02:35:40,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, bearing in mind that this is.

1495
02:35:43,280 --> 02:35:53,102
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe not strictly speaking what you would traditionally consider to be an overlay district, but it's similar in that the base zoning remains available.

1496
02:35:54,201 --> 02:35:55,042
[SPEAKER_02]: to the applicant.

1497
02:35:55,142 --> 02:36:04,749
[SPEAKER_02]: And so either they're going to exercise the PDD zoning or they're not, which is their choice.

1498
02:36:04,809 --> 02:36:17,540
[SPEAKER_02]: And as you said, if they don't, then they have to exercise the zoning and then obtain a building permit within set time standards.

1499
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:21,643
[SPEAKER_02]: And otherwise they have to start the process over again.

1500
02:36:22,877 --> 02:36:45,907
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think I could envision a situation where, say, the commercial space, there may be a desire to have flexibility in terms of how that commercial space could be used, because there's uncertainty as to what the highest and best use will be now.

1501
02:36:46,547 --> 02:36:51,369
[SPEAKER_02]: And you may want to, or the applicant and the city may want to leave flexibility

1502
02:36:52,330 --> 02:36:58,752
[SPEAKER_02]: Once the PDD is exercised, it won't be possible to just then go back and revert to the base zoning.

1503
02:36:58,792 --> 02:37:02,273
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll be operating under the PDD zoning.

1504
02:37:02,733 --> 02:37:20,918
[SPEAKER_02]: So it may make sense to keep in any uses as allowed uses or special permit uses that you could reasonably anticipate that commercial space being used for, even if it's not

1505
02:37:21,815 --> 02:37:23,456
[SPEAKER_02]: specifically contemplated now.

1506
02:37:24,397 --> 02:37:45,653
[SPEAKER_02]: So it might be a little bit of both in terms of leaving options open, but it doesn't necessarily, for instance, there's some industrial uses that are allowed in the base zoning, but you might determine and the board might determine

1507
02:37:46,667 --> 02:37:51,589
[SPEAKER_02]: would not be a good fit with the rest of this PDD development if it moves forward.

1508
02:37:51,909 --> 02:37:53,550
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe it makes sense to pull those out.

1509
02:37:56,211 --> 02:38:06,396
[SPEAKER_24]: If I may, Mr. Chair, so what I could suggest is if it would make the process a little more refined,

1510
02:38:07,541 --> 02:38:28,838
[SPEAKER_24]: I might be able to work with Attorney Silverstein, I can discuss with my client, but I anticipate that if it would be helpful, we could go through the use table and really carve out the uses that are

1511
02:38:31,145 --> 02:38:32,246
[SPEAKER_24]: relevant here.

1512
02:38:32,746 --> 02:38:41,632
[SPEAKER_24]: And we could, you know, dial back the base zoning uses that are not anticipated here, if it would make the board more comfortable.

1513
02:38:41,652 --> 02:38:54,720
[SPEAKER_24]: Because I understand that, that if you're looking to approve this as a PDD, and there are uses that are going to be by right, and they're inconsistent with the presentation, that you might not be comfortable at the next go around of them still being in there.

1514
02:38:56,241 --> 02:39:18,598
[SPEAKER_24]: problem at all in going through and just carving out and really just limiting the uses to the multifamily that you've seen and then really trying to figure out what the uses in that commercial building will be and making sure to take out items that we just know for certain will not be used.

1515
02:39:20,198 --> 02:39:22,660
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that that would be really smart.

1516
02:39:22,680 --> 02:39:24,682
[SPEAKER_08]: It would be a good use of time.

1517
02:39:24,782 --> 02:39:33,488
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it'll streamline what's in front of not only us, but we're more flexible, but maybe most importantly, what's in front of the city council.

1518
02:39:35,169 --> 02:39:38,451
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would be in favor of that suggestion.

1519
02:39:38,471 --> 02:39:39,352
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that would be helpful.

1520
02:39:39,392 --> 02:39:47,538
[SPEAKER_08]: Then we'd have a more refined product that we as a board could weigh in on a little bit and hopefully endorse and send forward.

1521
02:39:49,058 --> 02:40:09,473
[SPEAKER_24]: and I think that that would probably still be consistent with the with the process as it's laid out because if this board is going to be that presented with with the zoning amendment I think that that zoning amendment would be would be tailored towards this discussion not to say that that the board would be committing to something they haven't seen yet but I think it might be more palatable.

1522
02:40:13,185 --> 02:40:19,791
[SPEAKER_08]: That sounds good to me Attorney Silverstein, Director hunt or you also open to that any issues there.

1523
02:40:20,872 --> 02:40:21,933
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that makes good sense.

1524
02:40:25,196 --> 02:40:35,586
[SPEAKER_12]: Sure, that works I honestly hadn't envisioned the board going line by line through all of this tonight that that hadn't crossed my mind or we might have suggested it earlier, sorry.

1525
02:40:36,687 --> 02:40:37,087
[SPEAKER_08]: No problem.

1526
02:40:40,961 --> 02:40:44,984
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so we've closed public comment at this point.

1527
02:40:45,324 --> 02:40:48,226
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm thinking we've identified our next steps.

1528
02:40:52,969 --> 02:40:56,452
[SPEAKER_08]: Adam, are you on board with that on behalf of your team?

1529
02:40:56,492 --> 02:40:57,292
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, absolutely.

1530
02:40:57,552 --> 02:41:01,855
[SPEAKER_24]: And thank you all for your comments, your input and your time tonight.

1531
02:41:03,036 --> 02:41:03,356
[SPEAKER_08]: Excellent.

1532
02:41:03,456 --> 02:41:04,677
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, well, thanks for your patience.

1533
02:41:04,737 --> 02:41:08,600
[SPEAKER_08]: We look forward to seeing you kind of in the next go round, but Amanda, please.

1534
02:41:09,179 --> 02:41:10,920
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, sorry, just before anyone leaves.

1535
02:41:11,260 --> 02:41:19,286
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a public hearing, and I think that we would need to have a vote to continue the public hearing to a date certain.

1536
02:41:21,448 --> 02:41:31,395
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I guess this is sort of a question to the applicant on how much time they think that they would need to kind of go through this next step of pairing back.

1537
02:41:32,355 --> 02:41:33,236
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have a meeting.

1538
02:41:35,017 --> 02:41:39,321
[SPEAKER_01]: Advertised and available next Wednesday on the 3rd.

1539
02:41:39,461 --> 02:41:42,964
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you need more time, we can kind of go over other dates.

1540
02:41:44,846 --> 02:41:47,969
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, I mean, I guess just to clarify, I mean, I think the.

1541
02:41:51,417 --> 02:42:05,685
[SPEAKER_24]: I guess what I'm trying to figure out is a way just because this is a long process already, if there's a way to satisfy this step three, and also do the edits that we've discussed here.

1542
02:42:05,765 --> 02:42:19,332
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, I guess I'll defer to Attorney Silverstein on process here, but it would be my thought that we could continue to move forward in the process and that

1543
02:42:21,007 --> 02:42:26,931
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't believe that the board is voting on what's been presented to it tonight.

1544
02:42:26,971 --> 02:42:40,641
[SPEAKER_24]: I think that this is, as I read it, the process would be to have this meeting and then we would go then to, I mean, I guess I'll just defer to Attorney Silverstein on what that next process is.

1545
02:42:40,962 --> 02:42:48,167
[SPEAKER_24]: Because there, I mean, was the process that at step three, this as drafted would be referred to the city council?

1546
02:42:50,095 --> 02:42:50,355
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.

1547
02:42:50,395 --> 02:42:58,320
[SPEAKER_12]: Could I suggest, I think what we're wondering is, would it be sufficient for the board to say, big picture what you've presented is fine.

1548
02:42:58,560 --> 02:43:01,822
[SPEAKER_12]: The zoning that you put in front of us is too broad.

1549
02:43:01,882 --> 02:43:08,686
[SPEAKER_12]: We'd like to see it scaled back to only represent the project that you're talking about.

1550
02:43:09,887 --> 02:43:15,810
[SPEAKER_12]: In which case, we're supportive of the project as it's generally the general form of it.

1551
02:43:17,391 --> 02:43:20,315
[SPEAKER_12]: And therefore, this could be voted out of this hearing.

1552
02:43:20,335 --> 02:43:28,686
[SPEAKER_12]: The applicant would then present zoning that would allow what they've proposed.

1553
02:43:29,800 --> 02:43:39,164
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, but scaled back and not more than what they've proposed to the city council, which the city council would refer back to this board for comments.

1554
02:43:39,704 --> 02:43:47,907
[SPEAKER_12]: This board would then make comment on that more refined less deep like scaled back more restrictive zoning.

1555
02:43:49,267 --> 02:43:52,028
[SPEAKER_12]: With that, does that allowed under this process.

1556
02:43:54,611 --> 02:43:59,832
[SPEAKER_08]: I would suggest that that's a possibility of adding two steps where you don't want that to happen.

1557
02:43:59,872 --> 02:44:05,853
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that you what you want to do is refine it, focus it, have us vote on it because it won't take us long.

1558
02:44:06,573 --> 02:44:19,916
[SPEAKER_08]: Then you can go to city council, and they're not sending it back to send it back to you know I understand send it back for the first time for us to say we want four changes to go back to city council.

1559
02:44:20,776 --> 02:44:24,197
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think they could not even discuss it right like don't they.

1560
02:44:25,624 --> 02:44:29,866
[SPEAKER_10]: refer it, like they could just open it and refer it to the board.

1561
02:44:31,046 --> 02:44:37,489
[SPEAKER_12]: I think what what you're saying is that he thinks that when the refined version comes back this board is going to change it.

1562
02:44:43,192 --> 02:44:49,014
[SPEAKER_10]: Like any, like, like any zoning amendment, the process is it goes to the city council gets referred to the city board.

1563
02:44:49,034 --> 02:44:52,156
[SPEAKER_10]: You all make the changes you want.

1564
02:44:53,076 --> 02:44:54,497
[SPEAKER_10]: And then it goes to the city council.

1565
02:44:55,473 --> 02:44:58,555
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that not what we're doing?

1566
02:44:58,575 --> 02:45:09,644
[SPEAKER_02]: If I could jump in, Mr. Chair, I think maybe it would make sense from a process standpoint.

1567
02:45:10,945 --> 02:45:18,331
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that this board has to hold at least one more public hearing and then make recommendations before the council can adopt a zoning amendment.

1568
02:45:19,392 --> 02:45:21,253
[SPEAKER_02]: So no matter what that's gonna happen,

1569
02:45:23,897 --> 02:45:44,516
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think what I'm hearing staff say, and it might make sense from the standpoint of streamlining the process, to task staff, council, the applicant, to prepare and submit to the council the zoning amendment.

1570
02:45:47,987 --> 02:45:50,829
[SPEAKER_02]: referral back to the CD board is automatic.

1571
02:45:50,929 --> 02:46:15,582
[SPEAKER_02]: It's ministerial, it has to happen within 14 days and then any suggested tweaks from there, if there are no big picture concerns the board has at this point, that could be those, that fine tuning can be recommended coming out of the next public hearing

1572
02:46:16,785 --> 02:46:18,666
[SPEAKER_02]: after the referral back from council.

1573
02:46:19,407 --> 02:46:39,358
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I could throw one other option out there if the board's uncomfortable with that, which would be that the fine-tuned or the revised zoning amendment before it's actually submitted to council on the board's behalf,

1574
02:46:41,273 --> 02:46:43,094
[SPEAKER_02]: could be circulated to board members.

1575
02:46:43,895 --> 02:46:51,001
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously you could not deliberate on it outside of a public meeting.

1576
02:46:52,021 --> 02:47:07,373
[SPEAKER_02]: However, what board members could do would be to reply back to staff, whether or not they feel that an additional

1577
02:47:09,238 --> 02:47:13,020
[SPEAKER_02]: hearing session is required before it gets referred to the council.

1578
02:47:14,841 --> 02:47:20,463
[SPEAKER_02]: So if there are real concerns that members have, you wouldn't say what those concerns are.

1579
02:47:20,543 --> 02:47:26,466
[SPEAKER_02]: You would be sort of looking at it saying, yes, this is something I think we should meet on one more time.

1580
02:47:27,747 --> 02:47:35,050
[SPEAKER_02]: Not articulating why, because that would be a deliberation outside of a public meeting, but just, yes, I would like to schedule a meeting.

1581
02:47:35,070 --> 02:47:38,652
[SPEAKER_02]: The hope of course is that that does not happen,

1582
02:47:39,568 --> 02:47:53,853
[SPEAKER_02]: and the referral can take place, but we could say, all board members, please let staff know within two days if you feel a further meeting is necessary before it gets referred to council.

1583
02:47:56,254 --> 02:47:58,095
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess maybe I'm causing too many problems.

1584
02:47:59,055 --> 02:48:05,138
[SPEAKER_08]: My impression of the process is that our board was supposed to recommend the amendment,

1585
02:48:06,045 --> 02:48:24,434
[SPEAKER_08]: to the council and that the council would actually have an expectation that we, using our sort of expertise on things, we would have weighed in and they would be disappointed otherwise to not hear from us and would just throw it back to us and add additional steps.

1586
02:48:24,634 --> 02:48:28,836
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not suggesting I'm looking to make additional steps by being disagreeable about things.

1587
02:48:29,436 --> 02:48:34,180
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't know what the city council's reaction is going to be for the same this thing for the very first time.

1588
02:48:34,720 --> 02:48:40,685
[SPEAKER_08]: If you think it'll go to them and they're ready to deal with it and they can send it to us and we can make a few recommendations off of it.

1589
02:48:41,045 --> 02:48:46,729
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm fine with that.

1590
02:48:46,889 --> 02:48:51,913
[SPEAKER_24]: If I may, Mr chair, I'm just, you know, I'm reading the I'm reading the steps.

1591
02:48:52,574 --> 02:48:57,798
[SPEAKER_24]: And it does say that so you're going to hold this hearing, you're holding the hearing now and then it says,

1592
02:48:59,395 --> 02:49:06,437
[SPEAKER_24]: the CDB holds public hearing, prepares text of the proposed zoning amendment and locates the new district on the map.

1593
02:49:07,058 --> 02:49:09,658
[SPEAKER_24]: And then the amendment is presented to the city council.

1594
02:49:10,259 --> 02:49:26,864
[SPEAKER_24]: So, I mean, I don't think that there's would be any inconsistency if what we're telling you this evening, and if the board is looking to take a vote on this, that we would make, and we could work with council to make sure that the uses are consistent with the proposed

1595
02:49:28,473 --> 02:49:49,052
[SPEAKER_24]: somewhat of a broad term, but we could, I mean, under the table that we did provide this board, it does say, that's what Milton was actually had up in front initially, was that the uses are multiple dwelling, childcare center, office, gym, and then it says, as well as other uses allowed under C1 and GR.

1596
02:49:49,412 --> 02:49:53,756
[SPEAKER_24]: So I think we could take out all other uses and have

1597
02:49:54,457 --> 02:49:56,517
[SPEAKER_24]: the office, the gym, the daycare.

1598
02:49:57,018 --> 02:50:00,618
[SPEAKER_24]: And then, you know, I would need to speak to my client to make sure that we're not limiting.

1599
02:50:01,398 --> 02:50:06,360
[SPEAKER_24]: But I would I would say would be other ancillary light commercial uses.

1600
02:50:07,100 --> 02:50:18,102
[SPEAKER_24]: And if you'd be if the board would be comfortable doing that, again, it's going to go to the city council, they're going to talk about it, it's going to go back to the this board, you can talk about it, then it's going to go back to the city council for a vote.

1601
02:50:18,635 --> 02:50:29,182
[SPEAKER_24]: I think there's gonna be plenty of time to refine this and still logic to the project to go forward without the need to come back on the same step three which I just think might might be redundant.

1602
02:50:31,664 --> 02:50:31,944
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1603
02:50:36,227 --> 02:50:43,252
[SPEAKER_08]: So what's what's our vote tonight that it's a vote on a conceptual conceptual approval.

1604
02:50:46,763 --> 02:51:11,453
[SPEAKER_02]: So interestingly, Mr. Chair, there's no formal vote required under the ordinance, but you could, the board certainly could take a vote to support the zoning in concept and to request that staff work with council and the applicant

1605
02:51:12,393 --> 02:51:21,058
[SPEAKER_02]: to revise the zoning as discussed to narrow the scope of the allowed uses and to submit that to the council.

1606
02:51:22,779 --> 02:51:26,161
[SPEAKER_02]: So if the board did want to take a vote, I think that would be an appropriate vote.

1607
02:51:27,922 --> 02:51:28,202
Okay.

1608
02:51:35,767 --> 02:51:36,607
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, that sounds good.

1609
02:51:39,170 --> 02:51:41,053
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been doing a lot of the talking other board members.

1610
02:51:42,135 --> 02:51:53,372
[SPEAKER_08]: If someone's in support of this idea of could propose a vote in support of the adoption of the PDD.

1611
02:51:56,431 --> 02:52:15,141
[SPEAKER_08]: and to request that it be referred to city council after collaboration between city staff, council, and the applicant to work on a narrower scope of uses that would apply at the PDD.

1612
02:52:15,161 --> 02:52:18,723
[SPEAKER_30]: Seconded.

1613
02:52:26,254 --> 02:52:28,575
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, roll call vote.

1614
02:52:30,116 --> 02:52:33,777
[SPEAKER_08]: Attorney Silverstein stop us if we're, if we're being bad.

1615
02:52:34,818 --> 02:52:35,278
[SPEAKER_08]: Not at all.

1616
02:52:35,818 --> 02:52:36,539
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, excellent.

1617
02:52:37,319 --> 02:52:45,743
[SPEAKER_29]: I just, David, it has a lot with the fact that you're also an attorney and if anyone was going to understand what was going on tonight you'd be.

1618
02:52:48,604 --> 02:52:49,484
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, well I do try.

1619
02:52:49,504 --> 02:52:49,925
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1620
02:52:49,985 --> 02:52:50,585
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate it.

1621
02:52:51,225 --> 02:52:55,047
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, with our roll call then right back to you, our vice chair Jackie Furtado.

[SPEAKER_08]: Hi.

1644
02:53:27,760 --> 02:53:34,966
[SPEAKER_14]: David, quickly before we get into the next item, I need to take my dog out for a walk.

1645
02:53:35,666 --> 02:53:46,755
[SPEAKER_14]: I should be, you know, hopefully less than 20 minutes, depending on how he feels, but I still have the group now, so I'll be stepping away for a little bit.

1646
02:53:49,978 --> 02:53:51,099
[SPEAKER_20]: And the record will reflect that.

1647
02:53:51,659 --> 02:53:52,139
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1648
02:53:57,015 --> 02:53:59,397
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, Amanda, keep me on track here.

1649
02:53:59,417 --> 02:54:00,518
[SPEAKER_08]: Are we ready for our next item?

1650
02:54:01,479 --> 02:54:02,260
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we are.

1651
02:54:02,920 --> 02:54:03,181
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1652
02:54:04,762 --> 02:54:06,904
[SPEAKER_08]: And should I be reading a notice?

1653
02:54:08,565 --> 02:54:08,825
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

1654
02:54:09,586 --> 02:54:10,467
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, thank you.

1655
02:54:14,030 --> 02:54:14,911
[SPEAKER_20]: Public hearing notice.

1656
02:54:14,991 --> 02:54:18,254
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, the next item is concerns.

1657
02:54:20,195 --> 02:54:20,536
[SPEAKER_20]: Ruhal.

1658
02:54:25,021 --> 02:54:35,729
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, we met for Community Development Board will conduct a meeting tonight via zoom relative to an amendment to the site plan submitted by Zion, Brian.

1659
02:54:36,269 --> 02:54:41,853
[SPEAKER_08]: So Thor, excuse me, Brian, for the construction of a new 22,025 square foot beer hall.

1660
02:54:45,310 --> 02:54:56,455
[SPEAKER_08]: 142 mystic Avenue petitioner submitted a modified site plan for the review of the board with additional design details and commenting for the changes conditioned by the board at the October 22 hearing.

1661
02:54:56,535 --> 02:54:56,575
[SPEAKER_08]: So,

1662
02:55:06,108 --> 02:55:22,620
[SPEAKER_08]: Would the applicant team like to present and let us know where we're at I guess I should, before I do that, turn that over to you we have some members who are not, I think, on the board at the time that your hall first appeared before us.

1663
02:55:24,341 --> 02:55:33,648
[SPEAKER_08]: So, as, as background, we gave an approval to the site plan there were conditions, it was a conditional approver approval with conditions.

1664
02:55:34,822 --> 02:55:44,848
[SPEAKER_08]: And then it was an unusual step in that we had a list of items that we asked the applicant to return to advise the board about these.

1665
02:55:44,868 --> 02:55:46,008
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there were nine items.

1666
02:55:46,709 --> 02:55:52,532
[SPEAKER_08]: So we envisioned a return visit, and this is the first of the return visits.

1667
02:55:55,194 --> 02:55:56,554
[SPEAKER_22]: Kyle is going to be presenting tonight.

1668
02:55:56,575 --> 02:55:57,635
[SPEAKER_22]: Kyle, are you there?

1669
02:55:58,295 --> 02:55:59,036
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

1670
02:55:59,336 --> 02:55:59,396
[SPEAKER_22]: OK.

1671
02:55:59,416 --> 02:56:01,037
[SPEAKER_22]: Can I share my screen?

1672
02:56:01,057 --> 02:56:04,359
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be all set.

1673
02:56:08,716 --> 02:56:09,022
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

1674
02:56:10,622 --> 02:56:13,123
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'm going to make this short and sweet because we've been waiting for three hours.

1675
02:56:13,203 --> 02:56:17,164
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'm going to try to go through everything as quick as possible for everybody.

1676
02:56:17,184 --> 02:56:25,206
[SPEAKER_22]: It's been six months since we last sat with this board and went through the original site plan for the Great American Beer Hall.

1677
02:56:25,226 --> 02:56:32,329
[SPEAKER_22]: We're happy to say we've made a ton of progress based on your suggestions, comments from the previous meeting back in October.

1678
02:56:33,469 --> 02:56:39,791
[SPEAKER_22]: Over the last six months, we've worked tirelessly with our architect, our civil engineering team to improve the site.

1679
02:56:40,311 --> 02:56:47,240
[SPEAKER_22]: to its best ability and we welcome to all your thoughts and opinions that you guys suggested on the first go around and we appreciate those.

1680
02:56:47,841 --> 02:56:53,328
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think you'll be happy to see that we've made pretty much every accommodation to every suggestion made.

1681
02:56:53,348 --> 02:56:57,613
[SPEAKER_22]: I did want to start our presentation off by

1682
02:56:59,231 --> 02:57:14,491
[SPEAKER_22]: introducing a financial commitment partner on this project, which is actually Mass Development, which we were able to secure funding with shortly after the New Year program became available to us, and we jumped right on it.

1683
02:57:15,945 --> 02:57:22,272
[SPEAKER_22]: happy to say that the state is on board for this project and we have a representative of mass development on the call tonight.

1684
02:57:22,333 --> 02:57:29,541
[SPEAKER_22]: She would just like to say a word or two and basically what this beer hall could mean for the city of Medford and why they are interested in funding us in this project.

1685
02:57:29,821 --> 02:57:33,606
[SPEAKER_22]: Her name is Julie Cohen and I'll let her take it from here.

1686
02:57:35,290 --> 02:57:36,071
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Kyle.

1687
02:57:36,251 --> 02:57:37,392
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you, everyone.

1688
02:57:37,412 --> 02:57:40,454
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Julie Cowan, as Kyle said, with Mass Development.

1689
02:57:40,654 --> 02:57:45,177
[SPEAKER_00]: My role at Mass Development is as the Vice President of Lending for the Greater Boston Region.

1690
02:57:46,098 --> 02:57:48,019
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm also a longtime community volunteer.

1691
02:57:48,139 --> 02:57:54,284
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I just want to say to you, I applaud you all for the time and commitment that you're giving to this committee.

1692
02:57:55,204 --> 02:58:00,548
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly in this evening, you're diligent in your questions and your attention to the projects.

1693
02:58:00,628 --> 02:58:02,890
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's clear that you care about your community.

1694
02:58:04,311 --> 02:58:07,453
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to talk to you about what mass development does.

1695
02:58:07,913 --> 02:58:20,343
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to talk to you about my CV, other than to say to you that the reason I'm here this evening is that my commitment to this project and my enthusiasm for it equals that of my fandom of the Boston Bruins.

1696
02:58:20,883 --> 02:58:22,924
[SPEAKER_00]: which are currently tied with the Florida Panthers.

1697
02:58:23,404 --> 02:58:34,189
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the interest of seeing the last few minutes of the game, I'm going to just zip and talk to you about the reasons that I feel and why Mass Development are embracing this project.

1698
02:58:35,430 --> 02:58:40,772
[SPEAKER_00]: First, I want to say to you that it's interesting concept as a community gathering spot.

1699
02:58:41,512 --> 02:58:45,674
[SPEAKER_00]: Mass Development serves as the economic development finance agency and land bank for the state.

1700
02:58:46,074 --> 02:58:46,955
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we get involved,

1701
02:58:47,295 --> 02:58:50,056
[SPEAKER_00]: We hope to be there at the invitation of the community.

1702
02:58:50,396 --> 02:59:06,922
[SPEAKER_00]: We serve a variety of constituents and our role is to help you to promote economic development and to stabilize communities, to create an environment where businesses, nonprofits, municipalities, not just survive, but thrive.

1703
02:59:07,462 --> 02:59:16,565
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an interesting concept for us in that the community gathering spot that these gentlemen have designed in the form of Great American Beer Hall

1704
02:59:17,403 --> 02:59:23,729
[SPEAKER_00]: with the customers that are coming through there, they're likely to support other businesses that are in the area.

1705
02:59:24,330 --> 02:59:33,678
[SPEAKER_00]: And then people that might be interested in either establishing a new business or relocating a business may also then be attracted to the City of Medford.

1706
02:59:34,059 --> 02:59:42,407
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see it as one where there's a good opportunity for follow-on investment to help further your own goals within the City of Medford.

1707
02:59:43,078 --> 02:59:44,958
[SPEAKER_00]: The second is jobs creation.

1708
02:59:45,258 --> 02:59:48,959
[SPEAKER_00]: It's within our mission as a state agency to help create jobs.

1709
02:59:49,399 --> 03:00:02,422
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see this as a significant driver of a variety of levels, a variety of hours to accommodate the different needs and the plans for the business.

1710
03:00:04,342 --> 03:00:06,102
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll draw from the surrounding neighborhoods.

1711
03:00:06,303 --> 03:00:08,463
[SPEAKER_00]: So it'll help people that are already living there,

1712
03:00:08,963 --> 03:00:21,600
[SPEAKER_00]: to stay there, to build their own economic strength and wealth, but also may prompt some interest in people moving into the area to get that job at Great American Beer Hall.

1713
03:00:22,762 --> 03:00:27,748
[SPEAKER_00]: Third is that in the presentation it mentions right there SSBCI.

1714
03:00:28,529 --> 03:00:31,833
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something, as the slide tells you, that came out of ARPA.

1715
03:00:32,273 --> 03:00:39,442
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a significant tool for us in partnership with Stoneham Bank, which is the bank of choice for the group.

1716
03:00:40,065 --> 03:00:50,228
[SPEAKER_00]: behind Great American Beer Hall, it allows us to partner with them in providing support for a startup business in a lending environment that can often be risk averse.

1717
03:00:50,848 --> 03:00:55,170
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're able to help the bank and the partners to create this business.

1718
03:00:56,430 --> 03:01:04,232
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fourth is when we talk about being in partnership with the community, it really is about helping you to improve your own tax base.

1719
03:01:04,913 --> 03:01:09,014
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're gonna have a parking lot that's gonna be activated into a building

1720
03:01:09,599 --> 03:01:11,580
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned it as a community gathering spot.

1721
03:01:12,361 --> 03:01:15,143
[SPEAKER_00]: And by doing so, it'll be adding to your tax base.

1722
03:01:15,663 --> 03:01:16,644
[SPEAKER_00]: So for those reasons,

1723
03:01:17,254 --> 03:01:18,714
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're glad to be involved.

1724
03:01:19,194 --> 03:01:24,536
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly Stoneman Bank has shown a commitment to the project and clearly the partners have as well.

1725
03:01:24,796 --> 03:01:26,556
[SPEAKER_00]: They've devoted their personal resources.

1726
03:01:27,856 --> 03:01:38,919
[SPEAKER_00]: They've invested a significant amount of money in this, but they've also, they've come to it with a unique blend of talent and experience that tells us that the project will be successful.

1727
03:01:39,519 --> 03:01:45,320
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, thank you for giving me a few minutes on your very, very busy agenda, but we're really happy to be here.

1728
03:01:46,512 --> 03:01:46,892
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1729
03:01:46,932 --> 03:01:47,533
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Julie.

1730
03:01:47,833 --> 03:01:48,334
[SPEAKER_22]: Go Bruins.

1731
03:01:50,776 --> 03:02:01,085
[SPEAKER_22]: All right, so I'll continue off that but as Julie mentioned, you know, now that we have kind of our financing in place we've been hard at work over the last six months doing everything we can.

1732
03:02:01,105 --> 03:02:10,153
[SPEAKER_29]: I apologize, Kyle, I don't mean to interrupt you but there's something I should, I want to make sure there's not a conflict and I want to make sure that there's nothing precluding

1733
03:02:10,533 --> 03:02:11,854
[SPEAKER_29]: the approval from the board for you.

1734
03:02:12,715 --> 03:02:16,778
[SPEAKER_29]: So, Julie Cowan is my quasi-partner over at Mass Development.

1735
03:02:16,798 --> 03:02:18,760
[SPEAKER_29]: I work for the Secretary of Economic Development.

1736
03:02:19,260 --> 03:02:24,445
[SPEAKER_29]: SSBCI funding comes through my channels, and I just wanted to make sure that there's no conflict.

1737
03:02:24,485 --> 03:02:33,573
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't know if, David, if you're able to answer that question, but I just want to make sure that I'm not the reason that the proponent won't move forward.

1738
03:02:35,053 --> 03:02:43,238
[SPEAKER_08]: I would think that the most conservative thing to do is to recuse yourself from the deliberation, which is unfortunate because we always like your participation.

1739
03:02:43,418 --> 03:02:51,402
[SPEAKER_29]: But I just don't want to make sure that Kyle and Brian does not come after me if there's anything that concludes this process.

1740
03:02:51,422 --> 03:02:51,762
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1741
03:02:51,782 --> 03:02:52,663
[SPEAKER_22]: We had no idea.

1742
03:02:52,683 --> 03:02:54,123
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1743
03:02:54,143 --> 03:02:54,964
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you so much.

1744
03:02:54,984 --> 03:02:55,744
[SPEAKER_22]: Better to be safe.

1745
03:02:55,824 --> 03:02:56,164
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1746
03:02:56,184 --> 03:02:56,965
[SPEAKER_22]: Thanks, Jackie.

1747
03:02:59,672 --> 03:03:12,820
[SPEAKER_22]: All right, so yeah, without boring everybody with the review of the entire plan as it once was presented back in October, I'm just gonna focus on the things that we have done to improve our plan since we last met.

1748
03:03:13,440 --> 03:03:22,246
[SPEAKER_22]: And as you mentioned, back in October, we were essentially given an approval with conditions and a list of those conditions that we needed to meet and come back to this board and present to you, and we have done that.

1749
03:03:23,026 --> 03:03:29,050
[SPEAKER_22]: I have the civil engineer, Michael Giuliano on the call, and we also have the architect, Andrew Larson on the call.

1750
03:03:30,284 --> 03:03:33,066
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'll just step through and try to be as quick and brief as possible.

1751
03:03:34,327 --> 03:03:45,235
[SPEAKER_22]: So everybody who's familiar with the site 142 Mystic Ave, these are the satellite images of what the current use of the property is, which is essentially a tow yard and a bus yard.

1752
03:03:47,116 --> 03:03:58,344
[SPEAKER_22]: Basically, we've been hard at work trying to improve our site plan and improve some renderings for you guys and invest more money into this project and show you some higher quality things.

1753
03:03:59,402 --> 03:04:06,487
[SPEAKER_22]: a bit underfunded in the first go around and it was kind of basic drawings and schematics.

1754
03:04:06,507 --> 03:04:09,569
[SPEAKER_22]: So we've invested a lot of time and energy in presenting these to you.

1755
03:04:09,629 --> 03:04:12,651
[SPEAKER_22]: So the building has made significant improvements.

1756
03:04:13,772 --> 03:04:20,677
[SPEAKER_22]: As mentioned, I have the architect on the call to answer anything specific about the building in general, but I'd like to kind of just keep things moving and step it through.

1757
03:04:20,697 --> 03:04:25,300
[SPEAKER_22]: And if you have questions, we can reserve those for after and Andrew can hopefully answer those for us.

1758
03:04:25,620 --> 03:04:27,061
[SPEAKER_22]: It's a pre-engineered metal building.

1759
03:04:28,582 --> 03:04:32,244
[SPEAKER_22]: It sits on the lot just the same exact as we presented it back in October.

1760
03:04:34,265 --> 03:04:39,627
[SPEAKER_22]: The most improvements we feel we have made is a lot in the material choices that we're selecting.

1761
03:04:39,647 --> 03:04:41,688
[SPEAKER_22]: We've introduced as much greenery as possible.

1762
03:04:41,708 --> 03:04:47,011
[SPEAKER_22]: A lot of things you're seeing out here are live hop walls grown on vines, which we think are really cool.

1763
03:04:47,071 --> 03:04:51,693
[SPEAKER_22]: It ties into the beer hall aesthetic and it adds some greenery to the outside.

1764
03:04:51,713 --> 03:04:56,675
[SPEAKER_22]: We've also proposing a green screen on the side of the building facing the parking lot.

1765
03:04:57,570 --> 03:05:00,552
[SPEAKER_22]: But I think this is probably the most telling of all.

1766
03:05:00,632 --> 03:05:03,073
[SPEAKER_22]: This is an overlay rendering of the existing site.

1767
03:05:04,474 --> 03:05:14,419
[SPEAKER_22]: To the south, you can see the Atlas Liquors building there, and to the north is 131 Mystic Ave.

1768
03:05:14,759 --> 03:05:17,841
[SPEAKER_22]: The building sits on the southern side of the property.

1769
03:05:17,881 --> 03:05:19,502
[SPEAKER_22]: You can see the whole building there, 22,000 square feet.

1770
03:05:23,410 --> 03:05:26,611
[SPEAKER_22]: Basically, we have our parking lot on the left side here.

1771
03:05:26,651 --> 03:05:29,412
[SPEAKER_22]: This is the landscape that we've introduced.

1772
03:05:29,452 --> 03:05:31,273
[SPEAKER_22]: This is all in the landscape plan on the civil plan.

1773
03:05:31,313 --> 03:05:34,975
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm just showing you kind of the aerial rendering to try to put it all in perspective.

1774
03:05:36,055 --> 03:05:39,736
[SPEAKER_22]: Parking lot over here, our EV spaces are located still here on the side.

1775
03:05:39,776 --> 03:05:42,958
[SPEAKER_22]: We've introduced the crosswalk to the building from the parking lot.

1776
03:05:43,358 --> 03:05:48,060
[SPEAKER_22]: We've introduced crosswalks at all points coming from Mystic Ave into our property.

1777
03:05:49,589 --> 03:05:54,574
[SPEAKER_22]: We have our parking lot in the front, our landscape buffer on Mystic Ave.

1778
03:05:55,795 --> 03:05:59,979
[SPEAKER_22]: We have our pedestrian sidewalks coming off Mystic Ave and coming into the property.

1779
03:06:00,340 --> 03:06:03,723
[SPEAKER_22]: We have our pedestrian sidewalks going along the building and entering our building.

1780
03:06:04,515 --> 03:06:07,576
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, we have our little roof deck out here and our patio.

1781
03:06:08,076 --> 03:06:10,757
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, we tried to shield it with as much green as possible.

1782
03:06:11,197 --> 03:06:17,898
[SPEAKER_22]: We've consulted with the, uh, department, um, necessary, the fire department for the, uh, fire truck access.

1783
03:06:17,938 --> 03:06:21,379
[SPEAKER_22]: We've consulted with the traffic department and director Blake.

1784
03:06:21,999 --> 03:06:33,782
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, so we've done the best we can with this and we feel like, um, and it, we feel like we've, we've accommodated everything that you guys are looking for and have severely improved the site from what it once was.

1785
03:06:35,884 --> 03:06:38,147
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'm going to go next to the more.

1786
03:06:40,413 --> 03:06:41,573
[SPEAKER_22]: detailed plans.

1787
03:06:41,673 --> 03:06:47,135
[SPEAKER_22]: That was just kind of the pretty pictures, but let me get down to landscape plan.

1788
03:06:47,595 --> 03:06:50,176
[SPEAKER_22]: So this is just our planting plan and our landscape plan.

1789
03:06:51,237 --> 03:06:54,918
[SPEAKER_22]: This was done by a landscape architect from Gregory Lombardi design.

1790
03:06:55,338 --> 03:06:59,279
[SPEAKER_22]: Basically he spec'd various plants and listed them all here.

1791
03:06:59,840 --> 03:07:02,441
[SPEAKER_22]: This is included in the package we submitted to the board.

1792
03:07:02,861 --> 03:07:08,103
[SPEAKER_22]: So all these trees and shrubs and ground cover and grasses were selected by this group.

1793
03:07:09,965 --> 03:07:22,413
[SPEAKER_22]: Essentially, we have our landscape buffer going around the whole front and around the side as much as possible, and along the beer garden patio in the front, and then on the perimeter where we can around the main parking lot.

1794
03:07:23,597 --> 03:07:26,159
[SPEAKER_22]: That's the landscape plan, the site civil plan.

1795
03:07:26,219 --> 03:07:28,601
[SPEAKER_22]: As I said, civil engineer Michael Giuliano is on the call.

1796
03:07:29,041 --> 03:07:33,405
[SPEAKER_22]: He's been working closely with the city on getting this thing where it needs to be.

1797
03:07:33,865 --> 03:07:40,050
[SPEAKER_22]: He's also been in talks with the fire department to ensure that we have what we need for the fire truck in and out.

1798
03:07:41,371 --> 03:07:43,153
[SPEAKER_22]: So all that has been detailed here.

1799
03:07:43,333 --> 03:07:47,556
[SPEAKER_22]: It's provided to the planning board in the packet that we gave you.

1800
03:07:47,576 --> 03:07:49,818
[SPEAKER_22]: Forgive me if it's a little blurry here when I zoom in, but

1801
03:07:50,299 --> 03:07:52,842
[SPEAKER_22]: It has everything detailed, the crosswalk.

1802
03:07:53,002 --> 03:07:55,785
[SPEAKER_22]: It has your sidewalks, your ADA ramp access.

1803
03:07:56,165 --> 03:08:02,191
[SPEAKER_22]: It has everything listed there, including stormwater, drainage, utility, all that.

1804
03:08:04,294 --> 03:08:07,937
[SPEAKER_22]: Also included in their plan, this is the fire truck.

1805
03:08:08,973 --> 03:08:13,917
[SPEAKER_22]: Turn around, so this is for the Medford Force T-RAD fire truck turning plan.

1806
03:08:14,217 --> 03:08:16,699
[SPEAKER_22]: This was in consultation with the fire department.

1807
03:08:17,160 --> 03:08:26,968
[SPEAKER_22]: The fire truck can access the property on three sides, can come in through, park in the parking lot in the front, approach the building from the side and reach the building from the rear.

1808
03:08:28,589 --> 03:08:31,051
[SPEAKER_22]: We have letter of endorsement from the fire chief as well.

1809
03:08:32,132 --> 03:08:32,853
[SPEAKER_22]: So basically,

1810
03:08:34,317 --> 03:08:41,983
[SPEAKER_22]: Basically the things that you guys asked for and the approval of conditions, I'll just run through that list quick, but I just wanted to give you that quick overview of where we're at with our plan.

1811
03:08:42,624 --> 03:08:44,686
[SPEAKER_22]: A few things that we addressed here.

1812
03:08:44,806 --> 03:08:51,692
[SPEAKER_22]: So first was the applicant needed to improve pedestrian access with concrete sidewalks at the site entrance on Mystic Gav.

1813
03:08:51,712 --> 03:08:52,973
[SPEAKER_22]: We believe we have done that.

1814
03:08:53,013 --> 03:08:57,777
[SPEAKER_22]: We also included the curbing along Mystic Gav and the entrance to be vertical granite curbing.

1815
03:09:00,510 --> 03:09:05,494
[SPEAKER_22]: The, you asked that we replace all sidewalks and drive opening with new concrete along the entire property frontage.

1816
03:09:05,554 --> 03:09:07,655
[SPEAKER_22]: We've done that everywhere except for the curb cut.

1817
03:09:08,676 --> 03:09:14,100
[SPEAKER_22]: Second thing, applicant to provide new ADA compliant pedestrian sidewalk within the site to main entrance to the building.

1818
03:09:15,421 --> 03:09:16,142
[SPEAKER_22]: We have done that.

1819
03:09:16,522 --> 03:09:17,263
[SPEAKER_22]: It's in the plan.

1820
03:09:19,104 --> 03:09:23,167
[SPEAKER_22]: The site shall be designed with ADA compliant sidewalks and parking spaces required by law.

1821
03:09:23,187 --> 03:09:24,068
[SPEAKER_22]: So we did just that.

1822
03:09:26,015 --> 03:09:31,299
[SPEAKER_22]: The third thing you guys asked for, applicant to improve the landscape buffer along the Mystic Gap frontage to include nine and a half feet.

1823
03:09:31,439 --> 03:09:33,940
[SPEAKER_22]: We have done just exactly nine and a half feet.

1824
03:09:35,822 --> 03:09:39,504
[SPEAKER_22]: Applicant to increase the project gross landscape area to at least 9,000 square feet.

1825
03:09:39,984 --> 03:09:41,985
[SPEAKER_22]: We are at 9,500 square feet.

1826
03:09:42,886 --> 03:09:46,428
[SPEAKER_22]: Applicant to increase the total landscape and open space area to at least 13,400 square feet.

1827
03:09:46,468 --> 03:09:47,189
[SPEAKER_22]: We are at 13,700 square feet.

1828
03:09:52,055 --> 03:10:00,361
[SPEAKER_22]: applicant to include planting hedges along at least 80 feet of the Southeast Philly property line currently abutting Atlas Liquors.

1829
03:10:00,701 --> 03:10:06,685
[SPEAKER_22]: This was actually suggested against by the fire chief and his letter is provided.

1830
03:10:07,866 --> 03:10:16,132
[SPEAKER_22]: He wanted more fire access to the site and doesn't believe that those plants are appropriate in the sense that if he needs to get around the building, he doesn't want those there.

1831
03:10:17,173 --> 03:10:18,254
[SPEAKER_22]: So we deferred to him on that.

1832
03:10:19,309 --> 03:10:20,330
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, next thing.

1833
03:10:20,350 --> 03:10:21,511
[SPEAKER_08]: Hold on a second.

1834
03:10:21,531 --> 03:10:22,551
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I stop you on that one?

1835
03:10:22,572 --> 03:10:24,893
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I thought I saw a recommendation.

1836
03:10:24,953 --> 03:10:29,516
[SPEAKER_08]: It was the size of the, there were trees in the way and it should be bushes instead.

1837
03:10:29,556 --> 03:10:31,037
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, can you show us what that is?

1838
03:10:31,198 --> 03:10:34,620
[SPEAKER_22]: And yeah, so essentially, yeah, he, he didn't want the tall hedges.

1839
03:10:35,420 --> 03:10:39,744
[SPEAKER_22]: So, um, we still have the green space and small edges.

1840
03:10:40,024 --> 03:10:41,205
[SPEAKER_22]: He didn't want anything smaller.

1841
03:10:41,225 --> 03:10:42,045
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

1842
03:10:42,065 --> 03:10:42,926
[SPEAKER_22]: He didn't want our provide.

1843
03:10:42,946 --> 03:10:44,047
[SPEAKER_22]: He didn't want anything too tall.

1844
03:10:44,087 --> 03:10:47,009
[SPEAKER_22]: So we just still green space, but smaller plants.

1845
03:10:47,798 --> 03:10:50,299
[SPEAKER_22]: Can we go to the landscape plan?

1846
03:10:50,319 --> 03:10:50,780
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I see.

1847
03:10:51,940 --> 03:10:52,881
[SPEAKER_20]: Sorry, go up on.

1848
03:10:52,901 --> 03:10:58,424
[SPEAKER_20]: Please scroll down.

1849
03:10:58,584 --> 03:10:59,184
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

1850
03:10:59,204 --> 03:11:03,586
[SPEAKER_22]: So just along the Atlas liquor line, he didn't want any, any tall trees there.

1851
03:11:03,666 --> 03:11:07,268
[SPEAKER_22]: So we just have small shrubs all along here.

1852
03:11:11,050 --> 03:11:15,913
[SPEAKER_20]: Something we weren't against at all doing for you, but it was something that the fire chief did point out.

1853
03:11:23,171 --> 03:11:26,933
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, well, and what was what was the concern of today?

1854
03:11:27,074 --> 03:11:31,376
[SPEAKER_22]: I know it's not your so yeah, so he has for access on that side of the building.

1855
03:11:31,396 --> 03:11:32,577
[SPEAKER_22]: He's driving in Atlas Lickers.

1856
03:11:33,338 --> 03:11:37,780
[SPEAKER_22]: And he didn't want he didn't want tall trees in the way if he needs to put out a fire on the side of the building.

1857
03:11:38,321 --> 03:11:43,144
[SPEAKER_22]: So his request was just small, like, you know, two foot bushes on that side.

1858
03:11:43,164 --> 03:11:46,606
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1859
03:11:46,726 --> 03:11:47,567
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, thank you.

1860
03:11:48,327 --> 03:11:48,607
[SPEAKER_22]: All right.

1861
03:11:51,240 --> 03:11:53,681
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, sorry, I lost my thought.

1862
03:11:53,802 --> 03:11:58,144
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, applicant to include a landscape buffer zone around the main parking lot.

1863
03:11:58,884 --> 03:12:02,066
[SPEAKER_22]: This is where I think Brian can speak to this.

1864
03:12:02,086 --> 03:12:05,908
[SPEAKER_22]: This is in regards to the adjacent lot to the northern side of the property.

1865
03:12:06,769 --> 03:12:11,832
[SPEAKER_22]: So it's the same landlord that owns 142 Mystic owns 134 Mystic.

1866
03:12:12,332 --> 03:12:19,236
[SPEAKER_22]: And the 134 Mystic is a very tight and narrow driveway off of Mystic Avenue.

1867
03:12:19,256 --> 03:12:20,017
[SPEAKER_22]: It's a long lot.

1868
03:12:20,477 --> 03:12:20,657
[SPEAKER_22]: So

1869
03:12:21,258 --> 03:12:30,124
[SPEAKER_22]: In reference to future development, the ask is that there may be shared parking at 142 Mystic when 134 Mystic is developed.

1870
03:12:34,466 --> 03:12:44,733
[SPEAKER_22]: So that would be the one area in which we are looking relief from this board, is that's one area that we've looked at and we believe that's the one area we're looking for relief.

1871
03:12:46,368 --> 03:12:49,692
[SPEAKER_22]: And so we didn't feel like it was necessary to do something in lieu of that.

1872
03:12:49,772 --> 03:12:56,940
[SPEAKER_22]: So we actually put pickleball courts in off of the, Kyle if you want to go towards the beer garden.

1873
03:12:59,623 --> 03:13:01,205
[SPEAKER_22]: So right here, I'm going to zoom in a little bit.

1874
03:13:02,266 --> 03:13:04,048
[SPEAKER_22]: Two pickleball courts in open to the public.

1875
03:13:09,737 --> 03:13:11,798
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'll move on and we can go back to that.

1876
03:13:12,439 --> 03:13:16,981
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we should go back to that because I'm not sure that you need to leave everything open to have shared parking.

1877
03:13:17,021 --> 03:13:19,162
[SPEAKER_22]: But yeah, we can go back to that.

1878
03:13:19,703 --> 03:13:20,483
[SPEAKER_22]: All right.

1879
03:13:20,503 --> 03:13:24,606
[SPEAKER_22]: So the next thing, bike rack of at least 15 feet in length.

1880
03:13:24,646 --> 03:13:25,406
[SPEAKER_22]: We have done that.

1881
03:13:25,426 --> 03:13:29,889
[SPEAKER_22]: You can kind of see it's blurry in the image here, but it is listed on the civil engineering plan as well.

1882
03:13:30,449 --> 03:13:31,109
[SPEAKER_22]: But it's right here.

1883
03:13:33,385 --> 03:13:36,326
[SPEAKER_22]: Applicant to include two loading bays at the rear, that is included.

1884
03:13:37,346 --> 03:13:39,486
[SPEAKER_22]: It's again, more detailed on the civil plan.

1885
03:13:40,106 --> 03:13:42,527
[SPEAKER_22]: You can see it, and they are clearly labeled.

1886
03:13:44,127 --> 03:13:51,549
[SPEAKER_22]: Next is applicant to include provisions for running electrical conduit for future electric vehicle parking for at least seven parking spots.

1887
03:13:52,629 --> 03:13:55,850
[SPEAKER_22]: We have it on the landscape plan and the civil plan, all labeled for EV.

1888
03:13:59,062 --> 03:14:03,325
[SPEAKER_08]: Next one applicant to provide a fee, just to be clear that so that conduit will be run.

1889
03:14:03,985 --> 03:14:04,625
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, correct.

1890
03:14:05,046 --> 03:14:08,568
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, we're actually gonna we found a grant program where we're actually going to be.

1891
03:14:09,228 --> 03:14:11,049
[SPEAKER_22]: Our plan is to have them open on opening day.

1892
03:14:11,550 --> 03:14:12,130
[SPEAKER_22]: So, super.

1893
03:14:12,210 --> 03:14:12,390
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

1894
03:14:13,331 --> 03:14:15,532
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, so that's on the civil plan you'll see the conduit.

1895
03:14:18,640 --> 03:14:24,546
[SPEAKER_22]: Applicant to provide a phase plan for inclusion of fully functioning electrical vehicle parking to the office planning developments sustainability.

1896
03:14:24,926 --> 03:14:27,229
[SPEAKER_22]: We have already hired a power management company.

1897
03:14:27,889 --> 03:14:29,191
[SPEAKER_22]: We are in that process right now.

1898
03:14:29,211 --> 03:14:32,494
[SPEAKER_22]: And as Brian said, we are hopeful that we'd have it even operational by opening day.

1899
03:14:34,759 --> 03:14:41,145
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, so next is the applicant to include parking lot lighting and outdoor lighting in accordance with Medford City Ordinance.

1900
03:14:41,225 --> 03:14:48,391
[SPEAKER_22]: We provided the Omni Beer Hall site plan, which is outdoor parking lot lighting in accordance with the Medford City Ordinance.

1901
03:14:48,431 --> 03:14:49,812
[SPEAKER_22]: We provided a full lighting plan.

1902
03:14:51,774 --> 03:14:53,055
[SPEAKER_22]: It's actually on slide 30.

1903
03:14:53,195 --> 03:14:55,778
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, if you want to show it.

1904
03:14:56,638 --> 03:14:59,001
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, it's in the packet that was sent to the board.

1905
03:15:01,759 --> 03:15:03,401
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm capped out at 25 here, Brian.

1906
03:15:03,441 --> 03:15:03,781
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1907
03:15:03,941 --> 03:15:04,201
[SPEAKER_22]: All right.

1908
03:15:04,261 --> 03:15:04,842
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1909
03:15:05,843 --> 03:15:07,124
[SPEAKER_22]: But there's this right out there.

1910
03:15:07,144 --> 03:15:08,745
[SPEAKER_22]: We can come back to that if you want.

1911
03:15:08,785 --> 03:15:09,086
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

1912
03:15:09,646 --> 03:15:13,690
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm going to include permeable beavers to the outdoor beer garden patio.

1913
03:15:14,651 --> 03:15:19,035
[SPEAKER_22]: permeable beavers are included on our plan in the outdoor beer garden in

1914
03:15:21,081 --> 03:15:24,584
[SPEAKER_22]: Applicant to include an appropriate barrier around the perimeter of the beer garden patio.

1915
03:15:24,824 --> 03:15:29,928
[SPEAKER_22]: Applicant to use an industry standard of planters and guardrails that is compliant with the applicant's liquor license.

1916
03:15:30,569 --> 03:15:32,290
[SPEAKER_22]: So if you can kind of see, it's in here.

1917
03:15:33,271 --> 03:15:40,296
[SPEAKER_22]: We're working with the architects on how to make this as visually appealing and visually aesthetic as possible.

1918
03:15:41,277 --> 03:15:46,121
[SPEAKER_22]: So we can go into that a little bit more if you want more detail in our architects on the call to discuss options.

1919
03:15:46,161 --> 03:15:47,582
[SPEAKER_22]: But that is our plan.

1920
03:15:49,988 --> 03:15:53,209
[SPEAKER_22]: Applicant to provide ADA compliant pathways from the parking lot to the building.

1921
03:15:54,149 --> 03:15:54,870
[SPEAKER_22]: We have done that.

1922
03:15:54,910 --> 03:15:56,570
[SPEAKER_22]: We see the civil engineering plan.

1923
03:15:58,451 --> 03:16:03,152
[SPEAKER_22]: Applicant to include trees and plantings per the landscape requirements listed in City Ordinance 6.3.

1924
03:16:04,412 --> 03:16:06,453
[SPEAKER_22]: The landscape plan was created in August.

1925
03:16:06,633 --> 03:16:10,694
[SPEAKER_22]: The new landscape plan that you're seeing before you tonight is in accordance with Ordinance 6.3.

1926
03:16:10,754 --> 03:16:17,736
[SPEAKER_22]: And then the only concession we had to make was that one small one with the fire chief on that side facing Atlas Liquor.

1927
03:16:20,197 --> 03:16:26,921
[SPEAKER_08]: So, maybe we can stop right there just to ensure we're streamlined and no one wants to stay longer than we need to.

1928
03:16:28,482 --> 03:16:40,088
[SPEAKER_08]: What you just went through are the conditions to the approval of the site plan so you're reciting the fact that almost all of these you have reflect on the plans and all that kind of good stuff.

1929
03:16:40,909 --> 03:16:45,691
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to say from the board's perspective at this point, unless city staff tells me otherwise.

1930
03:16:46,872 --> 03:16:50,154
[SPEAKER_08]: that, like, it's in the city's hands.

1931
03:16:50,174 --> 03:16:55,477
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think that the board itself is determining whether the pedestrian sidewalk is a compliant.

1932
03:16:55,577 --> 03:17:05,442
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're, we're relying that the condition still applies, appreciating, you're saying yeah, we've got it on the plans and we're on board, but I feel like

1933
03:17:06,526 --> 03:17:12,729
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean Michael Giuliano was on the call can can speak to that I mean we wouldn't get a building permit if we were.

1934
03:17:12,910 --> 03:17:21,934
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so I just want to make sure that those conditions are applying so obviously can't get the permit until the things are squared away but that's, that's fine, like we're not working on that.

1935
03:17:23,935 --> 03:17:28,837
[SPEAKER_08]: So that we have the green border issue which we can talk about at the end if you want to keep going on your list.

1936
03:17:29,477 --> 03:17:38,559
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the patio with the permeable pavers, and I remember, Emily this was, this was perhaps one that you raised but maybe I'm mislabeling.

1937
03:17:40,120 --> 03:17:48,482
[SPEAKER_08]: What's, what's the scoop on on the patio, how much, how much is the hardscape that's impermeable how much is permeable.

1938
03:17:50,383 --> 03:17:51,344
[SPEAKER_22]: Andrew, are you on the call?

1939
03:17:51,364 --> 03:17:53,685
[SPEAKER_22]: Can you speak to that for square footages?

1940
03:17:54,766 --> 03:17:59,088
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, can you go to the landscape plan that you had your landscape architect prepare?

1941
03:17:59,528 --> 03:17:59,909
Sure.

1942
03:18:03,391 --> 03:18:06,352
[SPEAKER_22]: Andrew is our architect from Vision 3 Architects.

1943
03:18:09,694 --> 03:18:19,160
[SPEAKER_21]: I think it was actually Michael's latest site plan had the differentiation between

1944
03:18:23,581 --> 03:18:24,702
[SPEAKER_21]: I thought it was one of those plans.

1945
03:18:24,762 --> 03:18:32,346
[SPEAKER_21]: Either way, it's proposed to be about 60% hardscape and 40% permeable pavers, roughly.

1946
03:18:33,086 --> 03:18:36,328
[SPEAKER_16]: Is that just for the beer garden patio?

1947
03:18:36,768 --> 03:18:42,311
[SPEAKER_16]: Or is that for the parking area as well?

1948
03:18:42,671 --> 03:18:47,814
[SPEAKER_16]: Because I think the comment was about the parking area as well.

1949
03:18:51,196 --> 03:18:52,397
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't have the notes in front of me.

1950
03:18:53,729 --> 03:18:58,851
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, you guys might have the parking areas asphalt.

1951
03:18:58,971 --> 03:19:06,294
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, we never garden is the permeable pavers and the the poured concrete mix.

1952
03:19:07,874 --> 03:19:15,977
[SPEAKER_08]: Emily in fairness, just looking at the conditions or at least what is, you know, in the record, it's just for the outdoor beer garden.

1953
03:19:16,317 --> 03:19:16,518
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

1954
03:19:16,838 --> 03:19:16,998
[SPEAKER_16]: Great.

1955
03:19:17,158 --> 03:19:17,898
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks for checking.

1956
03:19:17,938 --> 03:19:20,339
[SPEAKER_16]: I really appreciate that.

1957
03:19:20,359 --> 03:19:21,499
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, that's a great change.

1958
03:19:21,519 --> 03:19:22,040
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you guys.

1959
03:19:22,960 --> 03:19:23,100
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

1960
03:19:27,124 --> 03:19:38,913
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr Chairman, are you okay if I continue or do you want to, yeah, we've got the we've got the landscape in between the two properties but otherwise I think now you're going to move to the rest of the list, which are the items that you were going to come back and inform us about.

1961
03:19:40,157 --> 03:19:48,304
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, so the next thing was applicant to evaluate, reassess and report on traffic circulation, public access and pedestrian circulation.

1962
03:19:49,705 --> 03:19:55,550
[SPEAKER_22]: The reassessment is not limited to but shall include concerns about people crossing the parking lot, vehicle access and inclusion of tighter radius curb edging.

1963
03:19:56,130 --> 03:20:09,021
[SPEAKER_22]: So this was all done with, we hired a third party traffic engineer and we've attached that letter and made adjustments to the site plan based on some of the information from that traffic study.

1964
03:20:09,781 --> 03:20:13,585
[SPEAKER_22]: We've also been in close contact and working with Director Blake on these issues.

1965
03:20:15,548 --> 03:20:23,516
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think if you have any questions regarding any of that, we can go through it more, but I believe we've reached

1966
03:20:25,064 --> 03:20:28,747
[SPEAKER_22]: from what I understand, a satisfactory condition on the site.

1967
03:20:28,767 --> 03:20:39,736
[SPEAKER_22]: The site circulation aisle provides a 24-foot drive aisle, which is sufficient to accommodate two-way traffic flow throughout the site and accommodate turning maneuvers to and from perpendicular parking.

1968
03:20:40,136 --> 03:20:52,306
[SPEAKER_22]: The proposed pedestrian accommodations, including sidewalk internal to the site and designated pedestrian crossing areas, will provide for safe pedestrian connectivity between the proposed building and the parking field serving this project.

1969
03:20:54,947 --> 03:21:03,632
[SPEAKER_22]: The loading dock and the dumpster area has been located in an area to minimize the potential for conflicts between pedestrian and vehicular traffic and loading activities for this project as well.

1970
03:21:04,752 --> 03:21:07,394
[SPEAKER_22]: So we feel like we've satisfied that.

1971
03:21:07,434 --> 03:21:12,777
[SPEAKER_22]: Those are direct quotes from Sean Kelly, who's of Vanassie & Associates, who did our traffic survey.

1972
03:21:14,578 --> 03:21:15,498
[SPEAKER_22]: And I believe we could...

1973
03:21:17,211 --> 03:21:23,433
[SPEAKER_22]: which leads us into the next thing, which is the applicant to work with the city director of traffic and transportation to maintain existing bus access.

1974
03:21:23,853 --> 03:21:36,057
[SPEAKER_08]: This is- Before we leave the first of the items, do we have input from the city, Amanda or others on traffic?

1975
03:21:36,277 --> 03:21:41,099
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got fire truck modeling and all sorts of other stuff.

1976
03:21:41,119 --> 03:21:44,600
[SPEAKER_08]: The fire department doesn't like the shrubs, have they weighed in on these items?

1977
03:21:45,684 --> 03:21:48,026
[SPEAKER_10]: If I may we have provided a memo.

1978
03:21:48,726 --> 03:21:56,011
[SPEAKER_10]: It did come in late, but we tried to organize what was before you tonight.

1979
03:21:56,031 --> 03:22:07,738
[SPEAKER_10]: The various conditions outlined under the second condition of the decision from the last meeting, they were here, and whether we found them to to be met.

1980
03:22:08,519 --> 03:22:14,603
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's some narrative of discussions with

1981
03:22:15,140 --> 03:22:18,723
[SPEAKER_10]: Director Blake, who I believe was on this call.

1982
03:22:18,803 --> 03:22:22,987
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks like he's still here, but we had numerous discussions with him.

1983
03:22:23,788 --> 03:22:26,931
[SPEAKER_10]: I personally didn't have any more discussions with the fire department.

1984
03:22:28,172 --> 03:22:30,614
[SPEAKER_10]: Is Alicia here or Amanda?

1985
03:22:31,915 --> 03:22:36,840
[SPEAKER_10]: Were there any other concerns that we were made aware of?

1986
03:22:38,286 --> 03:22:39,346
[SPEAKER_01]: by fire department.

1987
03:22:39,647 --> 03:22:49,031
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I knew about the shrubs or the tree issues on that side of the building, but I don't think there was anything else that would have affected the site plan.

1988
03:22:54,293 --> 03:22:59,795
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct, yeah, we didn't hear on any other items from the fire department.

1989
03:23:00,235 --> 03:23:05,898
[SPEAKER_12]: Would it be helpful to just step through each of the conditions that they asked to have changed?

1990
03:23:07,805 --> 03:23:35,533
[SPEAKER_10]: that we uh since we organized our thoughts on this because a lot of this was working um with the with brian you know significantly and you know meeting to you'll find what would work for the site and what would um be aligned with you know the the goals and the purposes of the conditions and um the the standards of the ordinance

1991
03:23:38,148 --> 03:23:41,251
[SPEAKER_10]: Right, so very tired at this point, I don't think I can even talk.

1992
03:23:42,993 --> 03:23:47,177
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I'm going to pull up the memo, which has organized right.

1993
03:23:48,553 --> 03:23:54,015
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, let me articulate what what the concern is and then maybe you can see how to best address it.

1994
03:23:54,936 --> 03:23:57,197
[SPEAKER_08]: The first set of items.

1995
03:23:57,757 --> 03:24:00,058
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are all conditions that we consider.

1996
03:24:00,738 --> 03:24:10,003
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think we can probably weigh in on, for instance, whether we want to make a waiver or an amendment on the landscape between the two properties.

1997
03:24:11,003 --> 03:24:16,966
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of these other things were a bit more open ended work with the city on this address traffic flow.

1998
03:24:18,154 --> 03:24:25,363
[SPEAKER_08]: If, if this site plan went to the city departments, and we got input, and the approval was based on the input.

1999
03:24:25,803 --> 03:24:32,932
[SPEAKER_08]: And now there's new information that's showing up, and we don't have the input of the city departments, then, then we're missing a step.

2000
03:24:33,397 --> 03:24:42,046
[SPEAKER_12]: So, right so that clarifies it so the item, a applicant to evaluate reassess report on traffic circulation, etc.

2001
03:24:42,687 --> 03:24:47,552
[SPEAKER_12]: That the applicant met with us they met with the traffic department they met with everybody.

2002
03:24:48,974 --> 03:24:51,116
[SPEAKER_12]: Several times they met with the building commissioner.

2003
03:24:52,718 --> 03:25:07,187
[SPEAKER_12]: They provided supplementary materials addressing the site circulation and access and the landscaping, and they were presenting those tonight but we feel that that condition was addressed that they met with everybody and that they met what was needed.

2004
03:25:07,207 --> 03:25:09,388
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that the item that you're asking about.

2005
03:25:09,808 --> 03:25:11,629
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's the, that's the.

2006
03:25:11,649 --> 03:25:17,673
[SPEAKER_12]: The next one was that the applicant was to work with the director of traffic and transportation to maintain existing bus access.

2007
03:25:18,193 --> 03:25:19,574
[SPEAKER_12]: We felt that that was completed.

2008
03:25:19,594 --> 03:25:20,534
[SPEAKER_12]: They did that.

2009
03:25:20,975 --> 03:25:21,895
[SPEAKER_08]: He's satisfied.

2010
03:25:21,955 --> 03:25:46,187
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me go back to the first one, because there's a level of question, questioning from the board members about the traffic flow, one way two way angle parking not angle parking so I think we probably do need a little bit more in terms of what did they look at and what is the traffic flow going to going to be now versus what it was before.

2011
03:25:47,475 --> 03:25:51,739
[SPEAKER_10]: So the original proposal was two ways throughout the entire site.

2012
03:25:52,259 --> 03:25:57,043
[SPEAKER_10]: And they went back to their traffic engineers.

2013
03:25:58,384 --> 03:26:03,508
[SPEAKER_10]: It wasn't quite what we asked, because it was we explored it and they say it works.

2014
03:26:03,528 --> 03:26:05,730
[SPEAKER_10]: We're like, well, that wasn't exactly what the condition was.

2015
03:26:05,770 --> 03:26:07,512
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't want the two way.

2016
03:26:08,052 --> 03:26:09,974
[SPEAKER_10]: We want to simplify the circulation.

2017
03:26:10,454 --> 03:26:15,038
[SPEAKER_10]: So they listened to what we had to say and came back with

2018
03:26:16,520 --> 03:26:20,081
[SPEAKER_10]: It's one way through the actual parking lot aisle.

2019
03:26:20,422 --> 03:26:20,802
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

2020
03:26:20,862 --> 03:26:21,882
[SPEAKER_08]: We haven't heard that.

2021
03:26:22,282 --> 03:26:23,063
[SPEAKER_08]: We're telling you.

2022
03:26:23,083 --> 03:26:24,743
[SPEAKER_10]: We're telling us this is what we came up with.

2023
03:26:24,783 --> 03:26:26,284
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be.

2024
03:26:26,304 --> 03:26:26,884
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I can.

2025
03:26:27,104 --> 03:26:27,524
[SPEAKER_22]: I can speak.

2026
03:26:27,824 --> 03:26:29,845
[SPEAKER_10]: I can speak in our memo.

2027
03:26:30,465 --> 03:26:34,247
[SPEAKER_22]: So David, I met with Marianne O'Connor talking about demolition.

2028
03:26:34,307 --> 03:26:38,128
[SPEAKER_22]: I met with the fire chief to talk about the return access.

2029
03:26:38,148 --> 03:26:41,029
[SPEAKER_22]: I actually did took all these meetings on my own.

2030
03:26:41,050 --> 03:26:44,531
[SPEAKER_22]: We don't have really the funds in the budget for an attorney or an engineer to do it.

2031
03:26:45,153 --> 03:26:46,033
[SPEAKER_22]: took it upon myself.

2032
03:26:46,113 --> 03:26:50,514
[SPEAKER_22]: So I handed in, I met with Vanessa and associates.

2033
03:26:50,674 --> 03:26:52,775
[SPEAKER_22]: I talked about the issues that came up in the board.

2034
03:26:53,375 --> 03:27:00,617
[SPEAKER_22]: And the big thing that came up was the vehicle, sorry, the truck delivery access in and out.

2035
03:27:00,717 --> 03:27:06,999
[SPEAKER_22]: So on the loading dock, they're going to back in and then they're going to need to take a left to go out through that main aisle.

2036
03:27:07,499 --> 03:27:11,320
[SPEAKER_22]: I can't have delivery trucks going straight to where that parking is.

2037
03:27:11,816 --> 03:27:13,276
[SPEAKER_22]: and then going and then making that turn.

2038
03:27:13,316 --> 03:27:17,357
[SPEAKER_22]: It just, the turn axis doesn't work as good as that main aisle.

2039
03:27:17,437 --> 03:27:27,960
[SPEAKER_22]: So I met with, you know, Alicia, Dan Hill, Amanda, and I proposed this idea of one way in that parking lot.

2040
03:27:28,000 --> 03:27:31,301
[SPEAKER_22]: So when you take that left, you can't come back out the way you came in.

2041
03:27:31,321 --> 03:27:34,942
[SPEAKER_22]: You have to head, you have to go towards Mystic Ave.

2042
03:27:34,962 --> 03:27:39,403
[SPEAKER_22]: And that's something I submitted after the fact, after our meeting, after this was done.

2043
03:27:40,436 --> 03:27:46,459
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure, so is there just a little visual so the board members can see that I did make something.

2044
03:27:46,479 --> 03:27:47,579
[SPEAKER_20]: Let me see if I can find it.

2045
03:28:04,346 --> 03:28:07,728
[SPEAKER_20]: I know Amanda, you probably have it too, but I'm going to go through our emails.

2046
03:28:19,833 --> 03:28:35,429
[SPEAKER_12]: The one on the screen is demonstrating why the trucks need to be able to go in the main aisle to so that they can't go, it's, they can't go through the parking so the main aisle there needs to be two way and you can see that because of the truck.

2047
03:28:36,238 --> 03:28:36,739
[SPEAKER_12]: turning.

2048
03:28:37,900 --> 03:28:44,426
[SPEAKER_12]: But if a vehicle were to drive down that and turn into do you have one that shows the arrows in the parking lot?

2049
03:28:44,466 --> 03:28:45,768
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that what you're looking for?

2050
03:28:45,868 --> 03:28:49,271
[SPEAKER_22]: I made it and I sent it over after our meeting.

2051
03:28:49,711 --> 03:28:53,295
[SPEAKER_01]: I just I just found the file screen.

2052
03:28:55,017 --> 03:28:55,818
[SPEAKER_01]: I just pull it up.

2053
03:28:58,640 --> 03:28:59,301
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Amanda.

2054
03:29:05,567 --> 03:29:09,453
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so if we pull this here, and then Kyle, would you mind stopping your share?

2055
03:29:09,473 --> 03:29:10,174
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

2056
03:29:10,715 --> 03:29:11,296
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

2057
03:29:11,316 --> 03:29:16,463
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're gonna do this.

2058
03:29:18,166 --> 03:29:19,307
[SPEAKER_20]: Let me make it a little bigger.

2059
03:29:24,670 --> 03:29:26,091
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what you were referring to, right?

2060
03:29:26,131 --> 03:29:27,131
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, exactly.

2061
03:29:27,151 --> 03:29:27,652
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

2062
03:29:27,752 --> 03:29:37,617
[SPEAKER_22]: So the blue line is the truck turn access, and that red line is the one-way traffic of how our customers would access the In-N-Out.

2063
03:29:43,464 --> 03:29:58,290
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, to clarify, any non-delivery vehicle would come in, could shoot down, take a leap through here, this is all going to be one way, come back out.

2064
03:29:58,370 --> 03:30:04,352
[SPEAKER_01]: Delivery vehicles follow the blue line, so they'd have to back in and then back out again.

2065
03:30:09,438 --> 03:30:14,082
[SPEAKER_22]: And our deliveries are not when we're open either.

2066
03:30:14,243 --> 03:30:14,963
[SPEAKER_22]: They're in the morning.

2067
03:30:14,983 --> 03:30:16,785
[SPEAKER_22]: So no customers.

2068
03:30:18,733 --> 03:30:30,817
[SPEAKER_01]: And as so part of what we outlined in our memo is that part of the mitigation for that and something that the applicant has agreed to is this crosswalk here, which goes to the main entrance of the building.

2069
03:30:31,837 --> 03:30:33,878
[SPEAKER_01]: And we ran this by Todd.

2070
03:30:35,058 --> 03:30:36,859
[SPEAKER_01]: This is to be a raised crosswalk.

2071
03:30:37,219 --> 03:30:46,782
[SPEAKER_01]: So bit of a traffic calming measure, you know, slow people down on the way in and out and make it very clear that this is a point of access to the building.

2072
03:30:53,728 --> 03:30:59,474
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, is there is the memo something that came out, like, right before the meeting, or, yes.

2073
03:31:01,825 --> 03:31:02,025
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

2074
03:31:02,125 --> 03:31:05,828
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it's at all helpful, I'm happy to throw the memo on the screen.

2075
03:31:06,188 --> 03:31:27,523
[SPEAKER_01]: And just because sometimes I know it's helpful to see like the things written down and we can go through one by one and kind of talk about from PDS's perspective, the logic behind certain recommendations that we make that speak to each of the conditions that were meant to be presented at this meeting.

2076
03:31:27,543 --> 03:31:29,505
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

2077
03:31:30,678 --> 03:31:45,392
[SPEAKER_12]: And as Amanda's doing that I thought it would be helpful to share so some of the stuff that Daniel's bringing us experience from other boards is that she's found it to be much more efficient and working in other communities where the staff prepare a memo with information.

2078
03:31:45,992 --> 03:32:06,786
[SPEAKER_12]: about concerns and recommendations that in normal times we would provide to the board several days in advance with your packet but in this case frankly we've been too swamped and behind and as we were trying to prepare for this meeting realized that this is the perfect example of when I had said to them once we're fully staffed

2079
03:32:07,206 --> 03:32:16,728
[SPEAKER_12]: it would be good to start doing these memos, but we realized that this project was the level of complication that was the perfect example of why we should be doing these memos.

2080
03:32:17,928 --> 03:32:20,489
[SPEAKER_12]: So we apologize that it was so late in coming.

2081
03:32:21,089 --> 03:32:27,571
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, so in fairness, and I'm pretty sure this is probably super valuable for us.

2082
03:32:28,491 --> 03:32:33,352
[SPEAKER_08]: Should we just continue this for next week so we have time to consider the memo?

2083
03:32:33,392 --> 03:32:33,592
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean,

2084
03:32:34,033 --> 03:32:37,815
[SPEAKER_12]: It's really important to this applicant to move things along fairly quickly.

2085
03:32:37,955 --> 03:32:39,737
[SPEAKER_12]: So we'd rather step you through it.

2086
03:32:41,978 --> 03:32:46,761
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, we were willing to read it tonight, but it was, we knew that the meeting would be long.

2087
03:32:46,861 --> 03:33:00,149
[SPEAKER_10]: And if we wanted to organize our thoughts and keep it, you know, on track to discuss the things that needed to be discussed, make the findings that need to be fine, get all the waivers that need to be made to button it all up.

2088
03:33:02,445 --> 03:33:04,106
[SPEAKER_10]: So we are happy to walk through this.

2089
03:33:04,126 --> 03:33:12,633
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't want to belabor or... Us preparing a memo wasn't meant to delay the hearing.

2090
03:33:12,653 --> 03:33:20,520
[SPEAKER_08]: No, but it might have the information that we need so that we could relatively quickly get comfortable with what's being presented.

2091
03:33:21,581 --> 03:33:27,045
[SPEAKER_08]: And so... Can I ask... What?

2092
03:33:31,003 --> 03:33:35,727
[SPEAKER_22]: If it's up to the applicant, it'd be more important for us to, you know, move forward with this project tonight.

2093
03:33:37,729 --> 03:33:38,169
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't mind.

2094
03:33:38,189 --> 03:33:39,410
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't mind.

2095
03:33:39,450 --> 03:33:41,151
[SPEAKER_22]: We've already waited three hours.

2096
03:33:41,231 --> 03:33:42,292
[SPEAKER_22]: We can go through each piece.

2097
03:33:47,056 --> 03:33:49,078
[SPEAKER_08]: The board members want to weigh in on that issue.

2098
03:33:49,098 --> 03:33:49,718
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm not.

2099
03:33:50,479 --> 03:33:55,043
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, it feels like a repeat from last meeting with you guys.

2100
03:33:55,603 --> 03:33:58,786
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, it sounds like this is a great project.

2101
03:33:59,286 --> 03:33:59,446
[SPEAKER_17]: It's 1012.

2102
03:34:01,133 --> 03:34:03,233
[SPEAKER_17]: want to make it 1112, let's just do it.

2103
03:34:04,334 --> 03:34:06,234
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, I do.

2104
03:34:06,334 --> 03:34:14,135
[SPEAKER_17]: But I do want to reiterate to the applicant, that the time pressure you keep putting on us is just straight up disrespectful.

2105
03:34:14,355 --> 03:34:17,336
[SPEAKER_17]: So like, let's be respectful of time.

2106
03:34:17,376 --> 03:34:18,496
[SPEAKER_22]: We've been here for three hours.

2107
03:34:18,556 --> 03:34:20,376
[SPEAKER_22]: And you're gonna tell us that we have to wait another week.

2108
03:34:21,817 --> 03:34:23,077
[SPEAKER_22]: That's a no fault of our own.

2109
03:34:23,117 --> 03:34:25,817
[SPEAKER_22]: We've prepared all our documents.

2110
03:34:27,078 --> 03:34:28,938
[SPEAKER_20]: Kyle, I'm the one that's saying let's do it.

2111
03:34:32,368 --> 03:34:32,908
[SPEAKER_20]: Thanks, Emily.

2112
03:34:34,608 --> 03:34:35,209
[SPEAKER_20]: Thanks, Brian.

2113
03:34:39,149 --> 03:34:41,110
[SPEAKER_08]: Any other board member have a thought on this.

2114
03:34:41,750 --> 03:34:49,831
[SPEAKER_08]: I just assume continue it because I'd like to consider the information and we have a meeting scheduled for next week, Emily's willing to go forward I'll go forward if the majority wants to do that.

2115
03:34:54,132 --> 03:34:58,173
[SPEAKER_11]: I have, I have no problem going forward if we can do that quickly.

2116
03:35:00,157 --> 03:35:01,298
[SPEAKER_11]: take a while.

2117
03:35:01,318 --> 03:35:13,347
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going to take a while and rather continue but I mean, it looks to me like this memo is only three pages if we can go through those three pages relatively quickly and then get an understanding that would be my preference.

2118
03:35:14,027 --> 03:35:14,748
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, thank you.

2119
03:35:15,328 --> 03:35:18,911
[SPEAKER_08]: Place you good sense for us.

2120
03:35:21,392 --> 03:35:22,553
[SPEAKER_18]: No, it's okay.

2121
03:35:23,034 --> 03:35:24,315
[SPEAKER_18]: Not not especially yet.

2122
03:35:24,695 --> 03:35:25,195
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, that's cool.

2123
03:35:26,256 --> 03:35:26,536
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

2124
03:35:27,637 --> 03:35:28,858
[SPEAKER_18]: I won't be here next week so

2125
03:35:31,293 --> 03:35:38,916
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm game to try, I'm definitely starting to fade, but let's give it a shot.

2126
03:35:39,376 --> 03:35:40,216
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, let's give it a shot.

2127
03:35:43,117 --> 03:35:45,178
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, all right.

2128
03:35:46,198 --> 03:35:53,361
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna take the lead and then Danielle or Alicia, please feel free to step in if I'm botching it.

2129
03:35:53,441 --> 03:35:56,862
[SPEAKER_01]: So you all can see my screen, correct?

2130
03:35:57,604 --> 03:35:58,625
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, thank you Amanda.

2131
03:35:58,965 --> 03:35:59,245
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

2132
03:35:59,885 --> 03:36:18,134
[SPEAKER_01]: So first, just to reiterate, in our decision, or the board's decision from October there was a list of conditions at the top that was like hard set, you know, in concrete conditions for the project and then there were a list at the bottom that folks are going to come back and present on.

2133
03:36:18,575 --> 03:36:20,916
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are referring to those with one exception.

2134
03:36:22,318 --> 03:36:28,625
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first being to evaluate, reassess, report on circulation, public access, and all of that.

2135
03:36:28,725 --> 03:36:30,266
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we started talking about that here.

2136
03:36:32,325 --> 03:36:57,339
[SPEAKER_01]: we feel that, and there are other parts which we'll get to that kind of speak to this, but so we've discussed here that this alternate proposal for the circulation is addressing the concerns that the board had raised in our opinion, that there's mitigation for the two-way traffic and that the two-way traffic lane and the central lane there is

2137
03:36:58,420 --> 03:37:04,428
[SPEAKER_01]: serving a reason or has a purpose, which is to allow for appropriate term radiuses for delivery of vehicles.

2138
03:37:06,891 --> 03:37:13,819
[SPEAKER_01]: Other elements of that have to do with landscaping, which we're going to cover in a later condition.

2139
03:37:14,039 --> 03:37:14,820
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll pause there.

2140
03:37:15,401 --> 03:37:16,042
[SPEAKER_01]: Any questions?

2141
03:37:18,652 --> 03:37:32,937
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so this the plan with the two way in the front, and the one way in the larger lot is something that will be reflected in their plans and the city will enforce in terms of signage and that kind of stuff that would go along with that.

2142
03:37:33,658 --> 03:37:34,078
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.

2143
03:37:34,758 --> 03:37:34,998
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

2144
03:37:38,239 --> 03:37:38,599
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

2145
03:37:40,100 --> 03:37:47,563
[SPEAKER_01]: Letter B applicant to work with this traffic and transportation director to maintain existing books access asset.

2146
03:37:48,613 --> 03:37:51,714
[SPEAKER_01]: access, we feel that this was addressed.

2147
03:37:52,414 --> 03:37:55,556
[SPEAKER_01]: The bus stop, I think, is somewhere over here.

2148
03:37:55,576 --> 03:37:58,097
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, install bus stop sign here.

2149
03:37:58,377 --> 03:38:11,602
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is another stop on the other side, which we will get to how we feel that this proposal actually expands access to that in a different letter.

2150
03:38:13,802 --> 03:38:14,083
[SPEAKER_01]: Pause.

2151
03:38:14,483 --> 03:38:15,043
[SPEAKER_01]: Any questions?

2152
03:38:18,375 --> 03:38:24,237
[SPEAKER_01]: letter C, applicant to demonstrate how the public accesses the site from the existing bus stop.

2153
03:38:24,297 --> 03:38:26,898
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is kind of similar vein.

2154
03:38:28,999 --> 03:38:39,823
[SPEAKER_01]: They have agreed to a proposal, which we'll describe in a lower letter, which helps improve the accessibility to the site because it involves this crosswalk.

2155
03:38:41,463 --> 03:38:45,364
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as a result, we feel that this condition is sufficiently addressed.

2156
03:38:47,153 --> 03:38:50,115
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll get a little bit more into that a little later down.

2157
03:38:51,135 --> 03:38:51,415
[SPEAKER_01]: Pause.

2158
03:38:51,635 --> 03:38:52,236
[SPEAKER_01]: Any questions?

2159
03:38:55,857 --> 03:38:55,998
[SPEAKER_01]: Nope.

2160
03:38:56,238 --> 03:38:56,498
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

2161
03:38:57,138 --> 03:39:02,941
[SPEAKER_01]: Letter D, applicant to provide a planting and landscaping plan that meets the appropriate ordinance standards.

2162
03:39:03,821 --> 03:39:12,586
[SPEAKER_01]: So on this one, the applicant, actually, it's not on this plan.

2163
03:39:12,686 --> 03:39:14,387
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to stop sharing screen.

2164
03:39:16,740 --> 03:39:27,026
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, if someone has handy, there's a landscaping plan, Brian, that you provided today that has some additional landscaping, basically tree wells.

2165
03:39:27,426 --> 03:39:34,010
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there's about four of them and they take up about, um, like four parking spots worth of.

2166
03:39:34,150 --> 03:39:35,471
[SPEAKER_22]: Want me to share my screen?

2167
03:39:36,271 --> 03:39:37,012
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, yes, please.

2168
03:39:37,292 --> 03:39:37,492
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

2169
03:39:37,732 --> 03:39:38,132
[SPEAKER_20]: One second.

2170
03:39:38,173 --> 03:39:42,275
[SPEAKER_20]: Let me just find it.

2171
03:39:42,295 --> 03:39:45,777
[SPEAKER_08]: And Amanda, can you please let, uh, make that memo available in our

2172
03:39:46,388 --> 03:39:47,829
[SPEAKER_08]: or tell me where to find it on our.

2173
03:39:48,570 --> 03:39:52,433
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, it's it should be in the meeting materials folder now.

2174
03:39:54,435 --> 03:40:00,780
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's not, then I'm happy to give a link to this Google document version, which has all the same stuff in it.

2175
03:40:01,261 --> 03:40:06,465
[SPEAKER_11]: David, it's under your hall in the top folder of that I've had to look around for it too.

2176
03:40:06,505 --> 03:40:08,547
[SPEAKER_01]: So sorry to make you dig.

2177
03:40:10,969 --> 03:40:12,090
[SPEAKER_22]: So yeah, this is the

2178
03:40:13,058 --> 03:40:20,340
[SPEAKER_22]: I just wanted to show that I know there's the rule where you need to have a tree shade every 10 parking spaces.

2179
03:40:20,400 --> 03:40:22,300
[SPEAKER_22]: So this is the proposal.

2180
03:40:23,620 --> 03:40:24,481
[SPEAKER_08]: PDS memo.

2181
03:40:24,761 --> 03:40:25,141
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

2182
03:40:27,941 --> 03:40:28,222
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.

2183
03:40:28,282 --> 03:40:39,124
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you take a look here, there's this provision in the zoning that requires a certain amount of interior landscaping for within a parking lot.

2184
03:40:39,784 --> 03:40:42,705
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we did some of the math and

2185
03:40:43,765 --> 03:40:53,089
[SPEAKER_01]: these four additional wells here that you see along the northern edge of the property are additions that we feel will meet that requirement.

2186
03:40:53,389 --> 03:41:08,655
[SPEAKER_01]: And with trees, et cetera, the idea being that that kind of creates a little bit more of a visual buffer between the properties without obstructing the potential for shared parking in the future with the adjacent site.

2187
03:41:11,409 --> 03:41:14,291
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, let me just take a look my notes here.

2188
03:41:16,772 --> 03:41:22,335
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you just walk me through again, or the four green squares on the top.

2189
03:41:22,855 --> 03:41:23,195
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

2190
03:41:23,936 --> 03:41:37,743
[SPEAKER_01]: So these additional spots here are to help comply with zoning landscaping requirements, and to provide a bit of a visual buffer between this property, and the adjacent property, and what's going to go in those.

2191
03:41:39,461 --> 03:41:41,021
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we discussed tree wells.

2192
03:41:41,061 --> 03:41:41,801
[SPEAKER_08]: Trees, yeah.

2193
03:41:43,662 --> 03:41:47,182
[SPEAKER_10]: So Brian, I'm imagining, did you just Photoshop those greens?

2194
03:41:47,622 --> 03:41:48,603
[SPEAKER_20]: I did, yeah.

2195
03:41:48,843 --> 03:41:49,623
[SPEAKER_10]: OK, yeah.

2196
03:41:49,643 --> 03:42:01,605
[SPEAKER_10]: So basically, this is illustrating what we will be conditioning, which we have the language in the recommended condition.

2197
03:42:01,625 --> 03:42:02,665
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're going to want trees.

2198
03:42:02,725 --> 03:42:06,986
[SPEAKER_10]: So the number of trees will be in excess of what is required.

2199
03:42:08,705 --> 03:42:11,007
[SPEAKER_08]: So there'll be a tree in each one of those?

2200
03:42:11,027 --> 03:42:14,350
[SPEAKER_22]: There'll be a tree in each one of those green spaces.

2201
03:42:15,130 --> 03:42:18,433
[SPEAKER_08]: And they'll be like the trees that are lining up?

2202
03:42:18,513 --> 03:42:18,633
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

2203
03:42:20,054 --> 03:42:22,617
[SPEAKER_22]: Kind of the same trees that are... Exactly, yeah.

2204
03:42:24,038 --> 03:42:32,505
[SPEAKER_17]: Does the applicant have flexibility to decrease the size of those green areas if the trees they're putting don't require that much space?

2205
03:42:33,426 --> 03:42:35,107
[SPEAKER_22]: You say decrease the size of the green?

2206
03:42:36,223 --> 03:42:40,004
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, yeah, decrease the size of the green and, like, kind of readjust the parking spaces.

2207
03:42:40,024 --> 03:42:44,825
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't think we do, uh, just, yeah.

2208
03:42:46,026 --> 03:42:58,629
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so there's a, there's a minimum kind of, um, like, floor area, almost, like, space requirement, um, for landscaping within interior parking spaces.

2209
03:42:59,229 --> 03:42:59,949
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, thank you.

2210
03:43:00,009 --> 03:43:02,430
[SPEAKER_17]: I appreciate the, um, background.

2211
03:43:04,415 --> 03:43:11,478
[SPEAKER_10]: There's rules about how many interior parking spaces can be in a row without being interrupted by an interior island.

2212
03:43:15,440 --> 03:43:30,526
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also of note here, kind of again to sort of, because there's not this landscaping buffer on the edge here, another concession that the project has made has been to put two pickleball courts, so striping for two courts in the

2213
03:43:32,815 --> 03:43:43,220
[SPEAKER_01]: parking that's in front of the building along Mystic Ave, which our office thinks is a really great use of the space, having that black space there better than having just parking.

2214
03:43:43,741 --> 03:43:49,144
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is actually a very strong desire and enthusiasm for pickleball in the city.

2215
03:43:51,745 --> 03:43:55,167
[SPEAKER_08]: How does one do that without the nets have to be there?

2216
03:43:56,267 --> 03:43:59,549
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, we'll have so it's as long as we don't have that parking demand,

2217
03:44:00,503 --> 03:44:06,370
[SPEAKER_22]: for that space, which during the week we don't anticipate it at all, probably on the weekends.

2218
03:44:06,390 --> 03:44:10,014
[SPEAKER_22]: But yeah, we're going to provide the nets and we're going to provide the lines.

2219
03:44:10,034 --> 03:44:17,123
[SPEAKER_22]: And since it's open to the public, given the current conditions of Mystic Ave, I can't imagine there's anywhere that's open for pickleballs.

2220
03:44:19,638 --> 03:44:19,878
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

2221
03:44:19,958 --> 03:44:28,982
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, um, one of the nice things about pickleball is, um, there are a lot of mobile nets, uh, and like equipment for, so that can be moved in and out.

2222
03:44:29,042 --> 03:44:33,924
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is actually how the existing pickleball courts function, um, on city property.

2223
03:44:33,944 --> 03:44:35,325
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

2224
03:44:35,365 --> 03:44:35,905
[SPEAKER_01]: I like this.

2225
03:44:36,985 --> 03:44:43,428
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, is there any issue with like this being right up against mystic with like stray pickleballs going into.

2226
03:44:44,185 --> 03:44:45,525
[SPEAKER_22]: I think we have enough buff.

2227
03:44:45,665 --> 03:44:47,346
[SPEAKER_22]: We have enough buffer with the landscape.

2228
03:44:47,366 --> 03:44:49,146
[SPEAKER_22]: Maybe we can zoom in on it.

2229
03:44:49,206 --> 03:44:52,906
[SPEAKER_22]: But no, I don't think that's going to be an issue.

2230
03:44:54,947 --> 03:44:56,667
[SPEAKER_22]: If it is, we'll do some sort of netting.

2231
03:44:57,647 --> 03:45:02,268
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, it looks like the director of traffic does have the same question.

2232
03:45:02,288 --> 03:45:04,988
[SPEAKER_17]: But it sounds like he's satisfied with the answer.

2233
03:45:05,008 --> 03:45:06,669
[SPEAKER_17]: I think this is cool.

2234
03:45:06,689 --> 03:45:12,530
[SPEAKER_17]: We had residents just ask about pickleball courts with some tennis courts that Tufts was redoing.

2235
03:45:13,030 --> 03:45:13,810
[SPEAKER_17]: So this is great.

2236
03:45:15,019 --> 03:45:15,339
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

2237
03:45:17,081 --> 03:45:17,381
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

2238
03:45:17,842 --> 03:45:18,122
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

2239
03:45:18,182 --> 03:45:19,263
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to keep moving.

2240
03:45:19,443 --> 03:45:20,084
[SPEAKER_01]: Folks are okay.

2241
03:45:21,425 --> 03:45:23,026
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

2242
03:45:23,046 --> 03:45:24,988
[SPEAKER_01]: So letter E applicant to provide.

2243
03:45:25,008 --> 03:45:26,730
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I'm sorry.

2244
03:45:26,750 --> 03:45:36,639
[SPEAKER_01]: I should back up and say that there was the one there was as a part of one of the concrete conditions in the decision, which is labeled one G in the decision.

2245
03:45:36,699 --> 03:45:37,500
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're looking at that.

2246
03:45:38,225 --> 03:45:44,288
[SPEAKER_01]: there was language saying or a condition saying applicant to include a landscape buffer zone around the main parking lot.

2247
03:45:45,269 --> 03:45:47,650
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is a request from the applicant.

2248
03:45:48,030 --> 03:45:49,991
[SPEAKER_08]: Just to be fair, that is a requirement in the ordinance.

2249
03:45:51,632 --> 03:45:51,912
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

2250
03:45:52,312 --> 03:45:56,334
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and the board, I'm sorry, I believe that's the case.

2251
03:45:57,095 --> 03:46:03,478
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also believe that the board has the ability if they so choose to waive that requirement.

2252
03:46:04,357 --> 03:46:09,500
[SPEAKER_22]: So I could weigh in and give you more information here on the line if you'd like, if it helps.

2253
03:46:11,401 --> 03:46:12,661
[SPEAKER_22]: It's tight.

2254
03:46:12,781 --> 03:46:13,782
[SPEAKER_22]: It's so tight right now.

2255
03:46:13,802 --> 03:46:17,284
[SPEAKER_22]: There's the driveway aisle of 134 and 142 Mystic.

2256
03:46:17,964 --> 03:46:21,366
[SPEAKER_22]: And it's just a really narrow, long site.

2257
03:46:21,526 --> 03:46:29,210
[SPEAKER_22]: And so that the landlords want to be able to use some of the parking at 142 Mystic to develop 134 Mystic.

2258
03:46:29,810 --> 03:46:31,651
[SPEAKER_22]: And I'll just give you an example.

2259
03:46:32,087 --> 03:46:37,490
[SPEAKER_22]: There's this building in Woburn, it's one of the Cummings buildings, and it's a long, narrow lot similar to what we have.

2260
03:46:38,331 --> 03:46:42,974
[SPEAKER_22]: They divided it up into these nice, pretty cool retail use buildings.

2261
03:46:42,994 --> 03:46:46,496
[SPEAKER_22]: That's why the idea is that's been kicked around, and I'll just show you right here.

2262
03:46:46,516 --> 03:46:55,261
[SPEAKER_22]: I just put this together, but if we were to do something like that, this row would be that shared parking for the 134 Mystic redevelopment,

2263
03:46:56,390 --> 03:47:04,356
[SPEAKER_22]: we'd be looking for rock climbing gyms, golf simulators, a coffee shop, gyms and yoga studios.

2264
03:47:04,916 --> 03:47:09,720
[SPEAKER_20]: That's the vision behind 134 Mystic in the ask for shared park.

2265
03:47:12,241 --> 03:47:20,587
[SPEAKER_10]: If I may through the chair, Brian, the site plans indicate that there's a retaining wall there.

2266
03:47:21,668 --> 03:47:22,849
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm trying to figure out how this

2267
03:47:23,532 --> 03:47:24,654
[SPEAKER_10]: share what's going to work.

2268
03:47:24,674 --> 03:47:26,938
[SPEAKER_10]: Was it just people would park there and then walk?

2269
03:47:26,958 --> 03:47:28,461
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, no, let me explain.

2270
03:47:28,842 --> 03:47:31,166
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so navigating this great difference.

2271
03:47:31,206 --> 03:47:31,426
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

2272
03:47:31,446 --> 03:47:34,612
[SPEAKER_22]: So the picture, the picture in the middle is the is the

2273
03:47:35,304 --> 03:47:44,127
[SPEAKER_22]: The difference in grade between 134 Mystic and 142 Mystic, the picture on the right is the grade between the Verizon building and 134 Mystic.

2274
03:47:44,187 --> 03:47:50,249
[SPEAKER_22]: So any redevelopment is going to require that building to be demoed and something new to rebuild.

2275
03:47:50,309 --> 03:47:53,350
[SPEAKER_22]: And so when that happens, we would raise the grade up.

2276
03:47:53,530 --> 03:47:59,932
[SPEAKER_22]: It's like 134 Mystic is like sunk below the Verizon building and below 142 Mystic just for whatever reason.

2277
03:47:59,972 --> 03:48:00,952
[SPEAKER_22]: It's just been like that forever.

2278
03:48:01,565 --> 03:48:07,310
[SPEAKER_22]: And so we would raise the grade to be equal to 142 Mystic to be able to use that shared park.

2279
03:48:17,699 --> 03:48:20,281
[SPEAKER_01]: Any other questions before we keep moving?

2280
03:48:20,661 --> 03:48:22,723
[SPEAKER_08]: If you go to redevelop it, you could just open it up.

2281
03:48:23,324 --> 03:48:25,766
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't... What do you mean?

2282
03:48:28,374 --> 03:48:37,857
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll tell you that it's a long like narrow site so the thought is to build another building sort of like the like what we have with the beer hall facing each other.

2283
03:48:38,357 --> 03:48:39,037
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's great.

2284
03:48:39,077 --> 03:48:39,317
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

2285
03:48:40,197 --> 03:48:40,417
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

2286
03:48:41,858 --> 03:48:47,479
[SPEAKER_08]: But I don't know why that why the green landscaping is an obstacle to doing that.

2287
03:48:48,133 --> 03:48:52,176
[SPEAKER_22]: Because we don't, right now the driveway aisle is right here.

2288
03:48:52,716 --> 03:48:55,358
[SPEAKER_22]: It's so tight on the current building.

2289
03:48:55,398 --> 03:48:59,701
[SPEAKER_22]: So to get to the back of 134 Mystic, this is the line right here.

2290
03:49:01,022 --> 03:49:06,805
[SPEAKER_22]: So we don't have the square footage to have the parking and a landscape buffer.

2291
03:49:09,087 --> 03:49:12,990
[SPEAKER_22]: I can't take it from 134 Mystic because the driveway aisle is too tight.

2292
03:49:13,030 --> 03:49:18,013
[SPEAKER_22]: And then I can't take it from 142 Mystic because we wouldn't have enough room for the parking.

2293
03:49:20,478 --> 03:49:32,787
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's helpful to add, the drive aisle on the 142 Mystic Ave site in the parking lot needs to be a certain width for it to be safe.

2294
03:49:32,827 --> 03:49:37,211
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's recommendations about what that width should be, and this currently meets it.

2295
03:49:37,411 --> 03:49:48,039
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe when we talked to Director Blake about narrowing that width, it's feasible but not recommended, especially for this kind of a use.

2296
03:49:49,491 --> 03:50:11,600
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, we did push to see how narrow we could get that and we understood the reasoning for why it needs to be that wide and taking it from Director Blake of safe maneuvering and that it could cause conflicts if people had to take so many different turns to back out of their spaces.

2297
03:50:11,680 --> 03:50:17,162
[SPEAKER_10]: So as staff, we couldn't see how conceivably they could put a meaningful

2298
03:50:17,873 --> 03:50:40,737
[SPEAKER_10]: landscaping buffer in between the two sites and you know we don't you know we never want to see somebody doing something to their site that would preclude future development and you know having to like rip out trees or something so I wouldn't want the adjacent site to somehow be stymied from

2299
03:50:43,967 --> 03:50:44,047
[SPEAKER_10]: that.

2300
03:50:44,067 --> 03:50:49,528
[SPEAKER_10]: Developing in a way because of, you know some trees that we want to save on the other side that.

2301
03:50:51,028 --> 03:50:53,209
[SPEAKER_10]: We're planted in the wrong spot or something like that.

2302
03:50:54,249 --> 03:50:56,749
[SPEAKER_10]: But that that's staff's perspective on that.

2303
03:50:58,990 --> 03:50:59,830
[SPEAKER_17]: That makes sense to me.

2304
03:50:59,850 --> 03:51:06,831
[SPEAKER_17]: Um I mean, it would be nice to have green space here, but taking taking into

2305
03:51:13,222 --> 03:51:15,442
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, ignoring what's happening on the other side of the fence.

2306
03:51:16,323 --> 03:51:18,083
[SPEAKER_17]: It sounds like we can't fit it on this site.

2307
03:51:19,243 --> 03:51:25,565
[SPEAKER_17]: We do have green space between the other row of parking and the main drive aisle.

2308
03:51:25,805 --> 03:51:26,985
[SPEAKER_17]: So, you know, that's nice.

2309
03:51:28,025 --> 03:51:33,286
[SPEAKER_17]: And I, you know, I don't think that this should be what stops us from moving this project forward.

2310
03:51:33,306 --> 03:51:35,387
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm fine without it.

2311
03:51:35,860 --> 03:51:37,361
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I would compare with that.

2312
03:51:37,401 --> 03:51:43,885
[SPEAKER_11]: I think this would be nice to have if you could fit it, but I don't see it as a reason to hold up the whole thing.

2313
03:51:44,746 --> 03:51:45,486
[SPEAKER_20]: At least not at this time.

2314
03:51:48,048 --> 03:51:48,488
[SPEAKER_20]: OK, thank you.

2315
03:51:52,270 --> 03:51:53,731
[SPEAKER_01]: Y'all comfortable if I keep moving?

2316
03:51:55,292 --> 03:51:55,792
[SPEAKER_20]: Keep going.

2317
03:51:56,433 --> 03:51:56,773
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

2318
03:51:57,153 --> 03:52:02,917
[SPEAKER_01]: So letter E was applicant is to provide detailed exhibits of the proposed building designs, which they have.

2319
03:52:03,137 --> 03:52:04,598
[SPEAKER_01]: So we feel that that's completed.

2320
03:52:06,627 --> 03:52:13,513
[SPEAKER_01]: In the planting plan, the letter F, applicant is to prioritize native species and plants with lower water needs.

2321
03:52:14,233 --> 03:52:24,862
[SPEAKER_01]: And our staff recommend that the board just retain this as a condition in the decision.

2322
03:52:25,342 --> 03:52:29,625
[SPEAKER_01]: So for when the applicant gets to that stage, they can comply.

2323
03:52:33,028 --> 03:52:35,290
[SPEAKER_20]: And I see a hand raised by Director Blake.

2324
03:52:39,650 --> 03:52:40,070
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

2325
03:52:40,090 --> 03:52:56,483
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to clarify because I don't recall stating that if the parking drive-out is a one-way, then if you have a one-way parking aisle, you could switch from perpendicular 90-degree parking to angled parking.

2326
03:52:56,943 --> 03:53:05,309
[SPEAKER_20]: And when you have angled parking, you could narrow drive-out in general parking dimension design.

2327
03:53:05,329 --> 03:53:08,672
[SPEAKER_20]: In case that's informative to anyone.

2328
03:53:09,750 --> 03:53:15,591
[SPEAKER_22]: It was, it was important to the landlord that we keep it open, and it'd be this style parking.

2329
03:53:16,111 --> 03:53:21,652
[SPEAKER_22]: If you see, if you go to like assembly row and you see like how they do parking over there it's not typically angled parking.

2330
03:53:25,673 --> 03:53:35,595
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sorry I just gotta jump in here, like, this is not the Wild West, like, you get a parking engineer and figure this stuff out, it's possible.

2331
03:53:35,895 --> 03:53:37,795
[SPEAKER_18]: It is definitely possible.

2332
03:53:40,003 --> 03:53:43,745
[SPEAKER_18]: Director Blake just said it, I've been thinking it since the beginning.

2333
03:53:44,865 --> 03:53:55,729
[SPEAKER_18]: You do a cross sectional diagram of this and you get a traffic engineer or a site engineer and you figure this out and you do it.

2334
03:53:56,370 --> 03:53:59,791
[SPEAKER_18]: We've asked you so many times, I'm at a loss personally.

2335
03:54:02,312 --> 03:54:06,874
[SPEAKER_20]: You don't park against property lines, it's just not good design.

2336
03:54:10,103 --> 03:54:11,064
[SPEAKER_20]: Michael, do you want to weigh in?

2337
03:54:13,885 --> 03:54:15,346
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, I might join in with Eaglebrook.

2338
03:54:15,646 --> 03:54:37,199
[SPEAKER_23]: I mean, we can look at to see if we can angle that, and certainly it is possible, and obviously the parking spaces become longer because right now they're 9 by 18, so once you angle them, they'll be 20 or 22 feet in length, and I can see what that dimension, see what we can do to

2339
03:54:38,343 --> 03:54:42,067
[SPEAKER_23]: you know, increase the amount of space between the property line agent parking.

2340
03:54:46,232 --> 03:54:46,412
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

2341
03:54:52,859 --> 03:54:53,861
[SPEAKER_20]: So they'll take a look at that.

2342
03:54:53,921 --> 03:54:55,062
[SPEAKER_08]: Amanda, do you want to continue?

2343
03:54:55,723 --> 03:54:56,183
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure thing.

2344
03:54:59,322 --> 03:55:03,843
[SPEAKER_01]: letter G applicant to explore the use of a one way vehicular loop and angled parking through the site.

2345
03:55:03,923 --> 03:55:06,504
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is relevant to what we were all just talking about.

2346
03:55:06,524 --> 03:55:07,724
[SPEAKER_08]: There we go.

2347
03:55:07,784 --> 03:55:08,384
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

2348
03:55:08,924 --> 03:55:22,047
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we've explained the one way vehicular loop piece so that it's not so viable for the central drive aisle, but the applicant has proposed it for the parking lot.

2349
03:55:23,968 --> 03:55:29,169
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes, just mentioned the angled parking as to be explored.

2350
03:55:30,930 --> 03:55:32,571
[SPEAKER_01]: to be included in the final

2351
03:55:46,861 --> 03:55:55,351
[SPEAKER_01]: The applicant has been in conversation with Director Blake regarding which of the off-site mitigation items as outlined in the letter are to be included.

2352
03:55:56,953 --> 03:56:06,685
[SPEAKER_01]: Director Blake, and he can speak for himself, but our understanding is that he maintains the mitigation options of his letter as they're outlined.

2353
03:56:07,025 --> 03:56:20,933
[SPEAKER_01]: and they are based on the project size and estimated traffic impact, and he recommends that the applicant include several mitigation items subject to MassDOT approval or reasonable alternatives, which are outlined in his letter.

2354
03:56:22,114 --> 03:56:33,581
[SPEAKER_01]: The applicant has communicated to us that the budget and timeline for their project is very tight and is concerned that pursuing the MassDOT mitigation items will detrimentally impact the project timeline.

2355
03:56:34,461 --> 03:56:51,985
[SPEAKER_01]: And as an alternative, the applicant proposed to commit to the provision of radar feedback signs, which is one of the items labeled in Director Blake's letter to I, but asserted that additional offsite mitigation would not be financially feasible.

2356
03:56:53,645 --> 03:56:55,006
[SPEAKER_01]: After reviewing mitigation for

2357
03:56:56,542 --> 03:57:10,236
[SPEAKER_01]: neighboring projects, it was, and this is somewhat new news, it was confirmed that actually radar feedback signs are going to be placed on Mystic Ave by an adjacent site, 162 Mystic Ave Theory Wellness.

2358
03:57:12,939 --> 03:57:15,701
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it doesn't make sense to include them again.

2359
03:57:18,328 --> 03:57:32,734
[SPEAKER_01]: The in consulting with Director Blake, staff determined that a potential equivalent option that would not require MassDOT approval would be to provide painted bump outs on the side streets in the vicinity of the project.

2360
03:57:33,135 --> 03:57:37,817
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's labeled as item 2i in Director Blake's letter.

2361
03:57:38,888 --> 03:57:47,450
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, after discussing mitigations options with director Blake and the applicant and confirming project constraints with stone and bank, the lender.

2362
03:57:48,371 --> 03:57:55,633
[SPEAKER_01]: Or 1 of the lenders, um, suggests that there be an alternate proposal for consideration and that this.

2363
03:57:56,642 --> 03:57:57,683
[SPEAKER_01]: be.

2364
03:57:58,383 --> 03:58:05,689
[SPEAKER_01]: So currently there is a lane merge located on Mystic Ave, basically by the proposed driveway entrance.

2365
03:58:06,690 --> 03:58:16,477
[SPEAKER_01]: And that could create some potential conflicts among vehicles kind of driving along Mystic Ave, as well as people entering and exiting the site.

2366
03:58:17,795 --> 03:58:37,938
[SPEAKER_01]: And so described as item 1A in Director Blake's letter, shifting the lane merge and moving the crosswalk that exists there to an appropriate corresponding location would help address this potential conflict and better support pedestrian safety when crossing Mystic Ave.

2367
03:58:38,698 --> 03:59:02,216
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, PDS feels that addressing this piece of it, the lane merge and the crosswalk are the more critical mitigation items, um, and recommends that the board consider including a condition requiring the applicant to first pursue this mitigation measure with MassDOT, which would require the submittal of a professionally prepared plan to MassDOT by a specific date.

2368
03:59:03,117 --> 03:59:08,198
[SPEAKER_01]: City staff would also help facilitate and connect the applicant to MassDOT.

2369
03:59:10,239 --> 03:59:17,121
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they hear back from MassDOT in the affirmative, they would be responsible for furnishing those improvements.

2370
03:59:17,981 --> 03:59:21,042
[SPEAKER_01]: However, if MassDOT does not approve

2371
03:59:21,583 --> 03:59:38,892
[SPEAKER_01]: of the proposed mitigation, so that lane merge movement, or is unresponsive to the proposal by the time that the applicant is applying for a certificate of occupancy, the applicant would be responsible only for providing the painted bump outs.

2372
03:59:41,394 --> 03:59:42,774
[SPEAKER_01]: So mitigation item 2i.

2373
03:59:43,415 --> 03:59:47,057
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to pause for a second because I feel like that's a lot.

2374
03:59:47,557 --> 03:59:51,259
[SPEAKER_01]: Are people clear on what I'm articulating?

2375
03:59:51,915 --> 03:59:58,702
[SPEAKER_08]: The, the ever dedicated director Blake, it looks like he's still still on the line hanging in there.

2376
03:59:59,703 --> 04:00:02,946
[SPEAKER_08]: Can, can we hear from our most dedicated.

2377
04:00:07,911 --> 04:00:08,292
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

2378
04:00:08,312 --> 04:00:10,594
[SPEAKER_07]: How are you feeling about all this.

2379
04:00:12,576 --> 04:00:15,138
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I think as Amanda had mentioned.

2380
04:00:16,592 --> 04:00:23,537
[SPEAKER_07]: I will take my narrow view of traffic only no reflection on the type of use, or how cool that may be.

2381
04:00:25,899 --> 04:00:29,081
[SPEAKER_07]: So, in regards to traffic alone which is my role for the city.

2382
04:00:29,101 --> 04:00:30,803
[SPEAKER_07]: The letter.

2383
04:00:31,683 --> 04:00:43,032
[SPEAKER_07]: After reading the study and the trip generation and potential traffic impacts, I believe my memo with recommendations is in line with, you know, consistent with

2384
04:00:43,792 --> 04:00:56,956
[SPEAKER_07]: the size and proportion related to potential impact as other previous projects such as 162 Dairy Wellness, Mystic Ave Dairy Wellness or Raisin Cane that was on earlier or any other similar projects.

2385
04:00:56,996 --> 04:01:07,140
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, I do agree though the RFP should be taken off the menu because it is being covered by 162 Mystic Ave.

2386
04:01:10,438 --> 04:01:15,602
[SPEAKER_08]: Could you get comfortable with the recommendations from from PBS.

2387
04:01:20,145 --> 04:01:23,628
[SPEAKER_07]: I know it's not an ideal and it's a good question.

2388
04:01:23,868 --> 04:01:36,317
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I was trying to take my narrow view of traffic only, and again being consistent so that to this project or any other project before after it doesn't seem favorable unfavorable in any way and unfair.

2389
04:01:37,666 --> 04:01:45,912
[SPEAKER_07]: And also my duty I feel to the neighboring community who points out any safety or traffic related things.

2390
04:01:47,173 --> 04:01:56,900
[SPEAKER_07]: So I guess I'll just reiterate my position on keeping the memo as is.

2391
04:01:57,861 --> 04:01:58,081
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

2392
04:02:00,183 --> 04:02:00,443
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

2393
04:02:09,500 --> 04:02:12,583
[SPEAKER_20]: Any questions on sort of what PDS outlined?

2394
04:02:14,064 --> 04:02:14,965
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it was sort of a lot.

2395
04:02:19,635 --> 04:02:20,755
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see if I've got it straight.

2396
04:02:20,775 --> 04:02:39,699
[SPEAKER_08]: It sounds like, you know, director Blake is has his recommendations from his memo and PDS is trying to forge kind of a compromise, if you will, prioritizing measures, but trying to understand the budget that's involved from the applicant's point of view.

2397
04:02:40,839 --> 04:02:45,400
[SPEAKER_08]: And so, the best item would be the one that would include dot sign off.

2398
04:02:47,040 --> 04:02:48,280
[SPEAKER_08]: If you can get it, you can get it.

2399
04:02:48,541 --> 04:02:57,104
[SPEAKER_08]: And if not, you go to the next most impactful mitigation step from PDS's point of view.

2400
04:02:57,124 --> 04:03:02,766
[SPEAKER_20]: Is that fair?

2401
04:03:02,946 --> 04:03:04,447
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, that's my understanding.

2402
04:03:05,747 --> 04:03:08,908
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

2403
04:03:09,128 --> 04:03:09,749
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Chair.

2404
04:03:10,429 --> 04:03:11,249
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, absolutely.

2405
04:03:11,269 --> 04:03:15,371
[SPEAKER_07]: I would just try to clarify

2406
04:03:16,604 --> 04:03:37,509
[SPEAKER_07]: whether the board seems going with what I had suggested or planning, which is obviously near purview, whichever it is, I just wanted to clarify that there seems to be some misunderstanding about, you know, at least the way I write stuff, proposing to MassDOT and something being no fault of the owner of the project.

2407
04:03:40,410 --> 04:03:46,131
[SPEAKER_07]: The intent is to provide a good faith effort of providing a plan that shows whatever that is.

2408
04:03:47,258 --> 04:03:55,466
[SPEAKER_07]: and going through that process and not necessarily not having doing that, which then therefore they deny something.

2409
04:03:57,147 --> 04:04:03,273
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, Todd, I wanted to meet with you as soon as possible to go over the process, just so I understand it better.

2410
04:04:04,133 --> 04:04:10,039
[SPEAKER_22]: And get modern traffic engineer to draw the plan and just walk me through how it works with mass dot.

2411
04:04:11,800 --> 04:04:12,561
[SPEAKER_22]: I think that's making a

2412
04:04:13,177 --> 04:04:14,878
[SPEAKER_22]: really good effort, like right away.

2413
04:04:14,898 --> 04:04:17,120
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't want to wait to the very end to do this.

2414
04:04:17,200 --> 04:04:17,860
[SPEAKER_22]: I want to do it now.

2415
04:04:19,461 --> 04:04:20,141
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2416
04:04:20,882 --> 04:04:23,223
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you have VAI prepare the study?

2417
04:04:23,404 --> 04:04:26,005
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have it in front of me.

2418
04:04:26,045 --> 04:04:40,474
[SPEAKER_07]: If you do use Vaness, they're very familiar with MassDOT process and have submitted to MassDOT for this very, you know, similar process, not same items, but similar process for 61 Locust Street and some other projects.

2419
04:04:41,215 --> 04:04:42,936
[SPEAKER_07]: So they know how to go about doing that.

2420
04:04:44,713 --> 04:04:47,035
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, I'd still appreciate your input on it.

2421
04:04:47,055 --> 04:04:53,001
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

2422
04:04:59,667 --> 04:05:05,333
[SPEAKER_08]: So it sounds like we have to make a decision, but do you have more on the list, Amanda, to summarize for us?

2423
04:05:08,088 --> 04:05:13,893
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I think that's those are all of the items and just taking a note here.

2424
04:05:15,135 --> 04:05:19,999
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think just to give a little bit of logic behind our thinking for that final recommendation.

2425
04:05:21,160 --> 04:05:24,763
[SPEAKER_01]: So shifting the lane merge and the crosswalk.

2426
04:05:25,344 --> 04:05:27,786
[SPEAKER_01]: We feel is, is one of the priority items.

2427
04:05:28,287 --> 04:05:32,551
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, making that good faith efforts and mass dot feels.

2428
04:05:34,172 --> 04:05:39,634
[SPEAKER_01]: like it ought to be one of the pieces that come out of this.

2429
04:05:41,194 --> 04:05:55,358
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think to add some assurance or mitigate some of the risk to the project on that, we've added this timeline of to submit and then to hear back before certificate of occupancy.

2430
04:05:56,959 --> 04:06:03,721
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the event that that does not work, that there's this alternate plan that still provides the city with some mitigation for the site.

2431
04:06:04,590 --> 04:06:04,714
[SPEAKER_01]: Um,

2432
04:06:06,359 --> 04:06:35,675
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll just mention that if we get to a point where, or the project gets to a point where maybe they've heard back from MassDOT in the affirmative and they start working on the mitigation, if it's not completed by the certificate of occupancy, we could, the board could also include some language if they so chose to either allow for maybe a temporary CFO until that work is complete or to continue through with it so long as the work is started.

2433
04:06:38,409 --> 04:06:43,195
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think unless Danielle or Alicia have any other pieces they want to add, that might be it.

2434
04:07:12,493 --> 04:07:14,454
[SPEAKER_08]: So where does that leave us we've got some open items.

2435
04:07:24,881 --> 04:07:29,724
[SPEAKER_08]: So we still have the issue of the angle parking, and what's going to happen on the border over there.

2436
04:07:37,140 --> 04:07:43,542
[SPEAKER_08]: And we have this question that you've presented about the PDS recommendation on the mitigation traffic steps.

2437
04:07:48,864 --> 04:07:49,724
[SPEAKER_20]: Traffic mitigation.

2438
04:07:59,087 --> 04:07:59,607
[SPEAKER_01]: If I may.

2439
04:08:00,268 --> 04:08:00,688
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, please.

2440
04:08:01,108 --> 04:08:03,929
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just trying to find, identify any open items.

2441
04:08:04,333 --> 04:08:12,435
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so on our prep document, David, I did list some potential either motions or items just for the board to consider.

2442
04:08:12,455 --> 04:08:15,516
[SPEAKER_01]: It includes the ones you just mentioned.

2443
04:08:16,796 --> 04:08:29,719
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, to amend the decision to include a condition that the applicant furnish and install a raised crosswalk at the building entrance and provide clear signage or other traffic wayfinding measures for that

2444
04:08:30,149 --> 04:08:32,051
[SPEAKER_01]: to reinforce that intended circulation.

2445
04:08:32,071 --> 04:08:33,772
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was one of them.

2446
04:08:35,013 --> 04:08:44,922
[SPEAKER_01]: And the potential, you know, the consideration of a waiver for condition 1G, which is the landscape buffer to amend the decision.

2447
04:08:46,464 --> 04:08:52,009
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think those were the items.

2448
04:09:01,411 --> 04:09:03,712
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, I mean, correct, correct me if I'm wrong.

2449
04:09:03,732 --> 04:09:25,002
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm new at this, but my understanding of what we have open is that there are some things that are continuing conditions of the decision that if not, that while not resolved are in progress, and that does not impede anything at the moment, but there are these open items that we need to address now.

2450
04:09:29,842 --> 04:09:57,153
[SPEAKER_11]: So something like the traffic mitigation, we don't need to be prescriptive about exactly what types of exact mitigation need to happen as long as some form of either Director Blake's recommendations or the PDS recommendations happen and we approve that.

2451
04:09:58,936 --> 04:10:10,200
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I think that's sort of where we were, that got us to this point, which is, we said, figure out traffic mitigation and resolve it collaboratively with director Blake.

2452
04:10:10,960 --> 04:10:18,323
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's what they're, they're trying to, I think, get us to bless the direction they need to take, you know.

2453
04:10:22,233 --> 04:10:36,182
[SPEAKER_12]: If I might, it's something that is difficult that gets run into when we're dealing with state roads is that clearly the appropriate mitigation involves something that we don't the city doesn't have the authority to approve.

2454
04:10:37,083 --> 04:10:39,525
[SPEAKER_12]: And so how do we on these roads.

2455
04:10:40,225 --> 04:10:44,707
[SPEAKER_12]: put these into place, which is sort of what we're recommending, is that they have to.

2456
04:10:44,727 --> 04:10:55,011
[SPEAKER_12]: So sometimes with the state, having the design and the plan is what it takes to get it done, but that it takes a long time.

2457
04:10:55,492 --> 04:11:03,335
[SPEAKER_12]: So what the director is recommending, if I might speak for him, I think, is that the applicant has these things

2458
04:11:05,516 --> 04:11:09,119
[SPEAKER_12]: drawn out, engineered, presents them to the state.

2459
04:11:10,400 --> 04:11:15,985
[SPEAKER_12]: The state may choose to allow them to do it right now, or they may take that into account for later.

2460
04:11:16,506 --> 04:11:19,528
[SPEAKER_12]: And it will come with the weight that the city asked them to do it.

2461
04:11:19,969 --> 04:11:22,170
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's not like they're coming, it's coming out of the blue.

2462
04:11:22,231 --> 04:11:24,212
[SPEAKER_12]: Now the state knows what we're asking for.

2463
04:11:24,352 --> 04:11:26,174
[SPEAKER_12]: And here's an engineer drawn thing.

2464
04:11:26,654 --> 04:11:29,016
[SPEAKER_12]: So there is benefit to that, even if

2465
04:11:29,957 --> 04:11:32,558
[SPEAKER_12]: if it happens that they decide that they don't approve it.

2466
04:11:33,418 --> 04:11:37,879
[SPEAKER_12]: For example, if the state's about to rip up that road, they might say, not right now.

2467
04:11:39,499 --> 04:11:43,540
[SPEAKER_12]: We're not going to hold up a certificate of occupancy because the state doesn't let them do it right now.

2468
04:11:44,460 --> 04:11:53,082
[SPEAKER_12]: And so that's sort of where, but this is the kind of thing that when we don't own the road, you know, we can't make them do things on that road.

2469
04:11:53,102 --> 04:11:56,023
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's, that's the difficulty here.

2470
04:12:00,384 --> 04:12:16,273
[SPEAKER_07]: I think in previous memos, and in this one, I usually write a subject to approval and if to no fault of their own, like the case that Director Hung just pointed out, that would be no fault of their own if they went through that process and the state just decided for whatever reason.

2471
04:12:16,974 --> 04:12:23,217
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's why sometimes my memos are longer, because I offer an alternate for that case.

2472
04:12:23,317 --> 04:12:29,321
[SPEAKER_07]: But there have been, like 162 MISTIC did include conditions that

2473
04:12:30,358 --> 04:12:34,019
[SPEAKER_07]: that required the state agency and then reason canes as well.

2474
04:12:34,439 --> 04:12:36,439
[SPEAKER_20]: So yeah, it's the luck of the draw which road you're on.

2475
04:12:45,861 --> 04:12:52,363
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, well this, I think there's only so much we can do tonight it's angle parking analysis is going to happen that's not going to be done here in the next 10 minutes.

2476
04:12:53,823 --> 04:12:54,904
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I agree with that.

2477
04:13:03,463 --> 04:13:18,299
[SPEAKER_12]: So one thing that I have to raise, we were very concerned by the applicant telling us about timelines and deadlines, which is why Amanda and I got on the phone with his bank and his lender and spoke to them directly to better understand this.

2478
04:13:18,960 --> 04:13:22,062
[SPEAKER_12]: And they basically said to us, this is how the banking world works.

2479
04:13:22,103 --> 04:13:23,684
[SPEAKER_12]: This is how the finances work.

2480
04:13:24,124 --> 04:13:25,925
[SPEAKER_12]: They are not a very large corporation.

2481
04:13:25,965 --> 04:13:26,806
[SPEAKER_12]: They're very small.

2482
04:13:27,367 --> 04:13:29,728
[SPEAKER_12]: They have their own finances on the line here.

2483
04:13:30,329 --> 04:13:35,253
[SPEAKER_12]: And they have to follow a very strict timeline or this project doesn't happen.

2484
04:13:35,973 --> 04:13:43,399
[SPEAKER_12]: And I have concern taking that from any applicant or any developer, but we spoke directly with Stoneman Bank on this.

2485
04:13:45,323 --> 04:13:54,147
[SPEAKER_12]: There are some, I think that if this was delayed a week, because we thought that these things could be brought together a week, that that was not going to cause a problem.

2486
04:13:54,747 --> 04:14:00,369
[SPEAKER_12]: But if this is something, and I don't know, I don't know how long it takes to redesign the parking.

2487
04:14:00,870 --> 04:14:12,214
[SPEAKER_12]: That's part of why we thought we had asked all the questions we needed to ask about was there any way to make this tighter a few weeks ago, and we understood that there wasn't.

2488
04:14:14,118 --> 04:14:17,502
[SPEAKER_12]: just because if it's a week or so, it's fine.

2489
04:14:17,942 --> 04:14:27,293
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm just relaying this to you because people like to come and say a project's going to fall apart if we don't get our timeline.

2490
04:14:28,394 --> 04:14:31,437
[SPEAKER_12]: That's why we spoke to his bank a couple of weeks ago.

2491
04:14:32,158 --> 04:14:33,159
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's my concern.

2492
04:14:33,219 --> 04:14:38,302
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm wondering if Todd can weigh in on, like, is this something that could be done right away?

2493
04:14:38,422 --> 04:14:39,643
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, is that possible?

2494
04:14:39,763 --> 04:14:48,088
[SPEAKER_12]: Is this going to anything that affects his budget significantly or any noticeable impact to his budget will cause problems for Stone and Bank?

2495
04:14:48,128 --> 04:14:49,829
[SPEAKER_12]: They've already made them cut the budget.

2496
04:14:51,170 --> 04:15:01,437
[SPEAKER_12]: And we don't want to see them lose their financing, lose their mass development loans, because we need to have some plantings along the border.

2497
04:15:02,978 --> 04:15:05,219
[SPEAKER_12]: It just feels like the trade-offs here.

2498
04:15:05,819 --> 04:15:06,960
[SPEAKER_12]: I just want to make this clear.

2499
04:15:07,000 --> 04:15:13,123
[SPEAKER_12]: This isn't some, you know, North Point development company that can do it.

2500
04:15:14,904 --> 04:15:18,846
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, there's a professional on the line who says that he can take a look at it.

2501
04:15:19,127 --> 04:15:23,129
[SPEAKER_08]: And I can't imagine it would take all that long to get onto here.

2502
04:15:23,409 --> 04:15:30,573
[SPEAKER_18]: Alicia, if I had this CAD drawing, I could do this assessment in about 20 minutes.

2503
04:15:32,940 --> 04:15:35,542
[SPEAKER_18]: So, and I'm not an, I'm not a traffic engineer.

2504
04:15:36,703 --> 04:15:44,569
[SPEAKER_10]: How would this, I'm trying to think of like the angle parking like from like a pedestrian standpoint like is that a safer condition.

2505
04:15:47,271 --> 04:15:57,538
[SPEAKER_10]: Backing out and all and what would we not be able to have the interior landscaping islands anymore How would those work in an angled situation, be angled.

2506
04:15:58,599 --> 04:16:00,921
[SPEAKER_10]: I just feel like it's going to be little.

2507
04:16:03,149 --> 04:16:04,089
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, strange.

2508
04:16:04,969 --> 04:16:07,770
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't really see that.

2509
04:16:08,250 --> 04:16:19,693
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not a board member, I don't have a vote, but I don't necessarily see the advantage of angled parking from, you know.

2510
04:16:19,713 --> 04:16:21,173
[SPEAKER_10]: Peter, were you about to say something?

2511
04:16:22,013 --> 04:16:29,335
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I was gonna say, I'd like to echo Director Blake's comments in the chat.

2512
04:16:30,877 --> 04:16:35,800
[SPEAKER_11]: As a practicing traffic engineer, this is not a very difficult thing to look at.

2513
04:16:35,960 --> 04:16:49,527
[SPEAKER_11]: And also, from the perspective of parking design, it is, I mean, the angle parking is not, especially in a parking lot setup, is not noticeably less safe.

2514
04:16:49,667 --> 04:16:52,068
[SPEAKER_11]: And it would just be the geometry that would shift.

2515
04:16:52,128 --> 04:16:52,549
[SPEAKER_11]: It would not.

2516
04:16:55,933 --> 04:16:59,876
[SPEAKER_18]: It's the kind of thing you can only do when you have a one-way street, obviously.

2517
04:17:00,336 --> 04:17:16,825
[SPEAKER_18]: And what it does is it enables you to take the drive aisle from a 24-feet foot width, which you need for two-way traffic, to a dimension potentially much less than that, down to 16 feet potentially.

2518
04:17:16,865 --> 04:17:17,166
[SPEAKER_18]: So, yeah.

2519
04:17:22,069 --> 04:17:26,571
[SPEAKER_18]: So a normal parking stall with 60 feet, right?

2520
04:17:27,292 --> 04:17:41,159
[SPEAKER_18]: An 18 foot drive aisle, two 24 foot, that doesn't, well, whatever it is, 24 foot and two stalls at whatever.

2521
04:17:42,399 --> 04:17:49,703
[SPEAKER_18]: And this just enables you to crunch that number down, which would push the whole thing down and now enable

2522
04:17:51,479 --> 04:17:58,344
[SPEAKER_18]: a strip along the property line, just something, you know, we've been asking for forever.

2523
04:17:58,884 --> 04:18:01,166
[SPEAKER_18]: You can Google it, it's pretty easy.

2524
04:18:01,186 --> 04:18:02,847
[SPEAKER_23]: This is Mike Giuliano.

2525
04:18:04,348 --> 04:18:10,732
[SPEAKER_23]: When would you need it for your next meeting because it's certainly something that can easily be done just a question of how much in advance do you need it.

2526
04:18:11,272 --> 04:18:12,733
[SPEAKER_23]: I think you said you had a meeting next week.

2527
04:18:13,154 --> 04:18:17,577
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we're scheduled, we're scheduled for a meeting on a week from tonight.

2528
04:18:18,533 --> 04:18:19,854
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, same time of week.

2529
04:18:20,394 --> 04:18:25,997
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, so you know that we can have it on Monday of next week as far as showing that layout.

2530
04:18:26,097 --> 04:18:27,118
[SPEAKER_08]: That would work.

2531
04:18:27,138 --> 04:18:28,418
[SPEAKER_23]: That would be great.

2532
04:18:29,839 --> 04:18:39,985
[SPEAKER_23]: And we would obviously have landscaping on adjacent to the property line and where the existing aisle is between the main aisle and parking lot.

2533
04:18:40,465 --> 04:18:48,349
[SPEAKER_23]: The question is, would you still need to show islands within that angled parking lot

2534
04:18:49,240 --> 04:18:50,261
[SPEAKER_23]: every 10 spaces.

2535
04:18:50,281 --> 04:18:52,643
[SPEAKER_23]: Could we eliminate that?

2536
04:18:52,663 --> 04:18:56,285
[SPEAKER_23]: Because now we're going to increase the landscaping along that property line significantly.

2537
04:18:57,646 --> 04:19:14,097
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I thought that those spaces in part were proposed by PDS trade-off with the... Yes, that was at least my understanding that it was a trade-off because they couldn't have the cover that they

2538
04:19:15,823 --> 04:19:16,966
[SPEAKER_11]: they previously thought.

2539
04:19:17,006 --> 04:19:21,940
[SPEAKER_11]: And if we were expanding the landscape cover, then that would become unnecessary.

2540
04:19:22,662 --> 04:19:23,384
[SPEAKER_08]: I think Peter's right.

2541
04:19:25,348 --> 04:19:27,690
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, there's a strange provision in the ordinance.

2542
04:19:28,150 --> 04:19:30,832
[SPEAKER_10]: It's 94, 6.3.5 large parking areas.

2543
04:19:31,372 --> 04:19:35,315
[SPEAKER_10]: And since it's kind of a weird parking lot, we're kind of, Amanda and I were looking at it.

2544
04:19:35,335 --> 04:19:40,439
[SPEAKER_10]: We're like, okay, if we drew a rectangle, like what would we consider like this parking lot?

2545
04:19:40,459 --> 04:19:42,781
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, okay, like this, the long skinny parking lot.

2546
04:19:42,801 --> 04:19:44,742
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, that has over 20 spaces.

2547
04:19:44,762 --> 04:19:52,268
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's subject to this interior landscaping requirement, but then it's okay, but it's so skinny.

2548
04:19:52,308 --> 04:19:54,029
[SPEAKER_10]: So where would you fit this interior?

2549
04:19:54,565 --> 04:19:55,385
[SPEAKER_10]: landscaping.

2550
04:19:55,826 --> 04:20:01,948
[SPEAKER_10]: It's those we just kept getting bumped against like how, so you can get the perimeter but you don't have the interior.

2551
04:20:04,109 --> 04:20:09,812
[SPEAKER_10]: What counts as interior, or it's not very clear but there is.

2552
04:20:09,832 --> 04:20:22,498
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean it does say that you can't have was it no more than 20 spaces parking spaces in a row that are uninterrupted by a

2553
04:20:24,343 --> 04:20:43,346
[SPEAKER_18]: by some form of an island, which I think they still would need to do if it's considered interior parking, but it's... Danielle, I think this is... We're doing the work for the engineer and I'm not particularly feeling like that's appropriate.

2554
04:20:44,688 --> 04:20:48,651
[SPEAKER_12]: No, no, she's saying that this is not in mitigation for the buffer.

2555
04:20:49,152 --> 04:21:05,263
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, the thing in mitigation for the buffer was the courts, the pickleball tree wells were because Danielle's been reading our zoning with a fine tooth comb and realize that this is in the performance standards that was added by the board over the summer.

2556
04:21:06,844 --> 04:21:07,165
[SPEAKER_30]: Correct.

2557
04:21:11,598 --> 04:21:22,427
[SPEAKER_10]: If it isn't going to meet the interior landscaping, you would need to grant a waiver for it, is what I'm bringing up to your attention, of the actions that you need to take when you ever approve the site.

2558
04:21:22,467 --> 04:21:37,480
[SPEAKER_10]: If you approve the site plan, there are going to be certain waivers that you're going to have to grant or not grant for some of these buried landscaping provisions that are scattered throughout the ordinance that are hard to find, and I've been trying to wrap my head around them and making sure that

2559
04:21:40,037 --> 04:21:42,218
[SPEAKER_10]: Everything that needs to be addressed is addressed.

2560
04:21:42,278 --> 04:21:43,539
[SPEAKER_22]: Can I just say one thing?

2561
04:21:45,920 --> 04:21:50,543
[SPEAKER_22]: Just going back to MassDev and going back to the bank, like, jeopardizes everything for us.

2562
04:21:50,663 --> 04:21:54,185
[SPEAKER_22]: Even if it's a week, we would like to close on our loan.

2563
04:21:54,845 --> 04:21:57,827
[SPEAKER_22]: Changing the site plan sometimes changes.

2564
04:21:57,867 --> 04:22:01,629
[SPEAKER_22]: If we lose parking spaces, we'll change the factor of how the bank actually looks at us.

2565
04:22:01,729 --> 04:22:06,912
[SPEAKER_22]: And so I would like to take this as a recommendation.

2566
04:22:08,107 --> 04:22:09,027
[SPEAKER_22]: and move forward tonight.

2567
04:22:09,227 --> 04:22:10,528
[SPEAKER_22]: Is that at all possible.

2568
04:22:12,688 --> 04:22:29,973
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm feeling that consensus is for a week so that we can see what this, what this thing looks like, but I, I'm just one vote so let me present that to the board and see if someone wants to take them at a point where I'd rather just take a vote tonight on it and not

2569
04:22:30,572 --> 04:22:33,393
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you really don't you really don't get the call on that.

2570
04:22:33,493 --> 04:22:37,594
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, not being disrespectful I just that's the way it is and it's 11 o'clock.

2571
04:22:38,935 --> 04:22:42,936
[SPEAKER_22]: I understand I didn't mean to be disrespectful and just trying to be honest about our budget.

2572
04:22:43,476 --> 04:22:50,719
[SPEAKER_08]: If there's a board member who'd like to offer a motion to continue this for one week to our next meeting.

2573
04:22:55,441 --> 04:22:56,141
[SPEAKER_08]: Or another motion.

2574
04:22:56,961 --> 04:22:59,142
[SPEAKER_08]: If I'm not reading the room correctly, that's fine too.

2575
04:22:59,762 --> 04:23:01,902
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, let me ask this question, Brian.

2576
04:23:01,922 --> 04:23:08,984
[SPEAKER_18]: You just said that potential change to the site plan could have impacts on your funding.

2577
04:23:12,624 --> 04:23:13,884
[SPEAKER_22]: It affects everything, our lease.

2578
04:23:14,004 --> 04:23:14,745
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I understand.

2579
04:23:14,785 --> 04:23:15,325
[SPEAKER_18]: I understand.

2580
04:23:15,685 --> 04:23:28,667
[SPEAKER_18]: But if we were to ask you in good faith to attempt to make this change to your site plan post-funding, then the bank would say no.

2581
04:23:30,708 --> 04:23:35,209
[SPEAKER_18]: But what do you mean by that?

2582
04:23:36,589 --> 04:23:42,030
[SPEAKER_22]: I can make a good faith effort and ask, but right now I'm locked into, you know, I'm locked into the funding.

2583
04:23:42,090 --> 04:23:44,470
[SPEAKER_22]: I could go back and say, Hey, look, this is what the board said.

2584
04:23:45,050 --> 04:23:46,291
[SPEAKER_22]: And can we make this change?

2585
04:23:46,551 --> 04:23:51,992
[SPEAKER_22]: I just don't want to jeopardize kind of losing what we have with everyone involved in this deal.

2586
04:23:53,852 --> 04:24:00,153
[SPEAKER_18]: I completely understand, but you know, this is something that we've asked about since you first came to us.

2587
04:24:01,339 --> 04:24:09,885
[SPEAKER_22]: I realized that, and I handed in everything so far in advance with the intention of getting feedback really far in advance.

2588
04:24:09,925 --> 04:24:12,587
[SPEAKER_22]: And if changes were to be made, I could have went to the landlords.

2589
04:24:12,627 --> 04:24:15,590
[SPEAKER_22]: I could have went to the bank and said, hey, here's what we're hearing.

2590
04:24:16,170 --> 04:24:19,593
[SPEAKER_22]: And again, I took the time to meet with all these people.

2591
04:24:20,013 --> 04:24:21,734
[SPEAKER_22]: I didn't have an attorney do it.

2592
04:24:21,794 --> 04:24:24,276
[SPEAKER_22]: I didn't have an engineer do it, an architect do it.

2593
04:24:24,356 --> 04:24:25,277
[SPEAKER_22]: I did it myself.

2594
04:24:25,857 --> 04:24:26,138
[SPEAKER_22]: David?

2595
04:24:26,158 --> 04:24:26,378
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

2596
04:24:33,307 --> 04:24:47,133
[SPEAKER_18]: I just I mean the bank could could could our approval be contingent on a, on a, on the site plan that proposes an alternative layout for that parking field.

2597
04:24:47,273 --> 04:24:51,834
[SPEAKER_08]: We've sort of already been through that one, one time and we're, we're, we're back at it again.

2598
04:24:51,854 --> 04:24:58,177
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I just get to a final resolution so they don't have they don't have to come back to us at all at that point.

2599
04:25:00,236 --> 04:25:07,158
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, we did, we did give them a some sort of approval previously, we did continue to the contingency right.

2600
04:25:07,758 --> 04:25:09,698
[SPEAKER_08]: It was, it was our approval.

2601
04:25:09,998 --> 04:25:16,200
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the conditions was a landscaping buffer between the properties.

2602
04:25:17,800 --> 04:25:21,261
[SPEAKER_17]: And they'd investigate the angle of parking.

2603
04:25:22,101 --> 04:25:22,221
[SPEAKER_18]: Yep.

2604
04:25:26,598 --> 04:25:30,101
[SPEAKER_20]: Ryan, you've sort of put yourself in the situation, you know?

2605
04:25:30,681 --> 04:25:30,962
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

2606
04:25:39,048 --> 04:25:39,629
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

2607
04:25:41,030 --> 04:25:53,920
[SPEAKER_18]: The problem is, is we could, we could grant you this with this, this approval with this contingency, but if it doesn't work out, then now, you know, the blame is on us, not on you.

2608
04:25:56,342 --> 04:25:58,083
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's not a position we're comfortable with.

2609
04:25:58,904 --> 04:25:59,524
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm certainly not.

2610
04:26:00,825 --> 04:26:01,005
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

2611
04:26:01,706 --> 04:26:05,648
[SPEAKER_22]: If you don't feel comfortable with the design, I guess, I guess that's it.

2612
04:26:06,849 --> 04:26:09,851
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, it's just, it's bad planning to park against somebody's property.

2613
04:26:11,092 --> 04:26:18,857
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, the owners own that it's the same landlords as one 42 mystic, the same people own one 34 mystics.

2614
04:26:18,877 --> 04:26:25,242
[SPEAKER_22]: So the whole idea was that when they go to develop one 34 mystic, that becomes shared parking because

2615
04:26:26,510 --> 04:26:29,751
[SPEAKER_22]: 134 Mystic is very tight and narrow on the Mystic Ave side.

2616
04:26:29,811 --> 04:26:38,894
[SPEAKER_22]: So without that, 134 Mystic becomes, I don't know, 50% like the value because you literally can't develop it without parking it.

2617
04:26:39,254 --> 04:26:41,435
[SPEAKER_18]: But now you're saying something different than you said earlier.

2618
04:26:41,535 --> 04:26:46,076
[SPEAKER_18]: You're saying we can't take land away from that property to create a green strip.

2619
04:26:46,256 --> 04:26:46,776
[SPEAKER_22]: No, no, no.

2620
04:26:46,816 --> 04:26:49,277
[SPEAKER_22]: So here is the current condition right here.

2621
04:26:49,337 --> 04:26:50,598
[SPEAKER_22]: See that driveway aisle?

2622
04:26:50,618 --> 04:26:52,838
[SPEAKER_17]: Where's the property line?

2623
04:26:53,859 --> 04:26:54,159
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

2624
04:26:54,219 --> 04:26:55,019
[SPEAKER_22]: So this is the,

2625
04:26:55,728 --> 04:26:57,908
[SPEAKER_22]: This is the rough property line right here.

2626
04:26:58,389 --> 04:27:00,989
[SPEAKER_17]: In the photo, where's the property line?

2627
04:27:01,349 --> 04:27:03,850
[SPEAKER_22]: It's inside the red rectangle.

2628
04:27:03,890 --> 04:27:05,710
[SPEAKER_22]: Can you go back to the photo?

2629
04:27:06,290 --> 04:27:09,671
[SPEAKER_22]: Sure.

2630
04:27:10,411 --> 04:27:13,032
[SPEAKER_22]: The current building is the property line.

2631
04:27:13,052 --> 04:27:13,772
[SPEAKER_17]: Where's the property line?

2632
04:27:14,212 --> 04:27:18,173
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, where that bus is, where that building is to the right, that is the property line.

2633
04:27:18,473 --> 04:27:21,593
[SPEAKER_22]: 134 Mystic, the current building is right there on that drive aisle.

2634
04:27:21,953 --> 04:27:23,394
[SPEAKER_22]: It's so tight to drive in there.

2635
04:27:23,754 --> 04:27:24,374
[SPEAKER_22]: I can't take.

2636
04:27:25,020 --> 04:27:27,602
[SPEAKER_17]: But these are separate parcels, correct?

2637
04:27:28,302 --> 04:27:30,603
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, but they're owned by the same landlord.

2638
04:27:30,623 --> 04:27:37,468
[SPEAKER_17]: I understand that, but you know, present ownership does not indicate future ownership.

2639
04:27:37,568 --> 04:27:49,135
[SPEAKER_17]: So if we just look at the parcel that we're talking about right now, where you're proposing Great American Beer Hall, completely ignoring what's happening in the other parcel, because it seems like that's kind of its own situation.

2640
04:27:49,155 --> 04:27:54,298
[SPEAKER_17]: If you angle the parking, which it sounds like is feasible, that gives us about six feet

2641
04:27:55,334 --> 04:28:01,235
[SPEAKER_17]: of space, and you can investigate whether a landscape buffer is possible in that space.

2642
04:28:02,015 --> 04:28:06,436
[SPEAKER_17]: The engineer that you brought on the call, I'm assuming he's an engineer, said that he'd be able to get it by Monday.

2643
04:28:06,456 --> 04:28:09,077
[SPEAKER_17]: That would give us plenty of time to hear it by Wednesday.

2644
04:28:10,157 --> 04:28:17,399
[SPEAKER_22]: If that works, then it sounds like... Are you saying to put a landscape buffer in between 134 and 142 Mystic?

2645
04:28:19,428 --> 04:28:22,951
[SPEAKER_12]: And can you clarify what you mean by a landscape buffer?

2646
04:28:23,232 --> 04:28:40,689
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, because I think that what I'm hearing is they're concerned that it's bushes that people couldn't walk through and they would like, but if grass and, you know, grass and planting, right, you're not saying it needs to be something that prevents people from moving between those two properties.

2647
04:28:40,709 --> 04:28:41,790
[SPEAKER_08]: No one has ever said that.

2648
04:28:41,850 --> 04:28:42,991
[SPEAKER_08]: We've been talking about this for months.

2649
04:28:43,031 --> 04:28:43,772
[SPEAKER_08]: That's never come up.

2650
04:28:44,305 --> 04:28:54,191
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's what he may be hearing, because, because that that that was the whole crux of my question like how does that defeat the ability to develop the person you just walk from one spot to the other.

2651
04:28:54,771 --> 04:28:54,991
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

2652
04:29:04,537 --> 04:29:08,680
[SPEAKER_17]: Like see what you have in between the parking area and that driveline.

2653
04:29:11,778 --> 04:29:15,460
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, so the left-hand picture is the drive aisle for 134 Mystic Ave.

2654
04:29:16,780 --> 04:29:19,121
[SPEAKER_17]: Again, we're not talking about 134 Mystic Ave.

2655
04:29:19,141 --> 04:29:23,383
[SPEAKER_17]: We're talking about the property where Great American Beer Hall is located.

2656
04:29:23,663 --> 04:29:24,384
[SPEAKER_22]: What was the question?

2657
04:29:24,404 --> 04:29:25,224
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm sorry.

2658
04:29:25,424 --> 04:29:26,965
[SPEAKER_22]: I thought that was what you were asking.

2659
04:29:28,225 --> 04:29:28,305
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

2660
04:29:28,885 --> 04:29:30,366
[SPEAKER_17]: In the landscape rendering that you have?

2661
04:29:30,866 --> 04:29:31,026
[SPEAKER_20]: Yep.

2662
04:29:32,447 --> 04:29:32,747
[SPEAKER_17]: Pause.

2663
04:29:33,608 --> 04:29:33,808
[SPEAKER_20]: OK.

2664
04:29:34,508 --> 04:29:35,168
[SPEAKER_17]: So do you see?

2665
04:29:35,188 --> 04:29:36,889
[SPEAKER_17]: I think I can draw and stuff.

2666
04:29:37,869 --> 04:29:38,870
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's see if that works.

2667
04:29:40,108 --> 04:29:40,708
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think I can.

2668
04:29:41,108 --> 04:29:42,729
[SPEAKER_28]: We got the annotation turned off.

2669
04:29:43,269 --> 04:29:43,949
[SPEAKER_17]: OK, that's fine.

2670
04:29:44,870 --> 04:29:49,591
[SPEAKER_17]: So we have the drive aisle between the beer garden and the parking area.

2671
04:29:51,052 --> 04:29:55,133
[SPEAKER_17]: See how there's a little landscape area with little kind of, assuming those are trees.

2672
04:29:56,114 --> 04:29:57,394
[SPEAKER_17]: They don't even have to be trees.

2673
04:29:57,594 --> 04:30:06,657
[SPEAKER_15]: But take that, copy paste, and throw it on the back.

2674
04:30:11,526 --> 04:30:12,246
[SPEAKER_20]: Klaus, what do you think?

2675
04:30:18,769 --> 04:30:21,890
[SPEAKER_20]: I think this is like, this is a difficult situation.

2676
04:30:21,910 --> 04:30:38,157
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, because you know, I, I think Brian, the problem is, is that like, we asked you to investigate this and you didn't, you know, if you had brought us a drawing,

2677
04:30:38,887 --> 04:30:41,348
[SPEAKER_18]: and showed the angle parking and showed the straight parking.

2678
04:30:42,168 --> 04:30:54,190
[SPEAKER_18]: And you put them side by side and you say, here's the reason I want to stay with the parallel parking this this this and this and look, and you can can, but you didn't, you just said, I'm not doing that.

2679
04:30:54,750 --> 04:31:00,512
[SPEAKER_22]: No, I didn't I didn't, I didn't say that I brought it to the landlord's attention, and this is the way they prefer to do it.

2680
04:31:02,587 --> 04:31:05,610
[SPEAKER_22]: I didn't, it's not like I didn't, I didn't look at it and said, oh, I don't want to do that.

2681
04:31:05,630 --> 04:31:06,610
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, screw that.

2682
04:31:06,810 --> 04:31:07,951
[SPEAKER_22]: That's not the case at all.

2683
04:31:07,971 --> 04:31:09,152
[SPEAKER_22]: I brought it to their attention.

2684
04:31:10,253 --> 04:31:12,975
[SPEAKER_18]: It doesn't sound like it's the angled parking's been studied.

2685
04:31:14,677 --> 04:31:15,917
[SPEAKER_22]: It's something they don't want.

2686
04:31:16,238 --> 04:31:17,799
[SPEAKER_22]: It's, it's what they asked of me.

2687
04:31:17,839 --> 04:31:19,200
[SPEAKER_22]: It's what's in our lease.

2688
04:31:19,240 --> 04:31:20,741
[SPEAKER_22]: This is the site plan that they wanted.

2689
04:31:21,182 --> 04:31:24,984
[SPEAKER_22]: And they've, they've owned this for a long time.

2690
04:31:25,765 --> 04:31:26,506
[SPEAKER_22]: Same as the other one.

2691
04:31:28,687 --> 04:31:30,048
[SPEAKER_08]: The landlord's a related party.

2692
04:31:30,269 --> 04:31:30,529
[SPEAKER_08]: This is.

2693
04:31:31,553 --> 04:31:36,616
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, yeah, it's yeah, it's just because we're related doesn't make it easy.

2694
04:31:36,636 --> 04:31:37,037
[SPEAKER_22]: Trust me.

2695
04:31:45,122 --> 04:31:46,283
[SPEAKER_20]: How do we move this forward?

2696
04:31:47,484 --> 04:31:49,225
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm asking the board just to clarify.

2697
04:31:54,828 --> 04:31:55,989
[SPEAKER_08]: We can continue for a week.

2698
04:31:56,009 --> 04:31:56,750
[SPEAKER_08]: That's one option.

2699
04:32:03,357 --> 04:32:03,597
[SPEAKER_20]: that.

2700
04:32:05,437 --> 04:32:08,278
[SPEAKER_10]: Did we want to say Todd has had some comments in the chat.

2701
04:32:08,298 --> 04:32:10,298
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if anyone wants to.

2702
04:32:10,498 --> 04:32:24,681
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I saw Todd's comments, and I think if we were going to go with the what we had just been talking about with the landscape buffer, then that's not a problem because while it would be shared parking.

2703
04:32:26,862 --> 04:32:30,543
[SPEAKER_17]: Just to confirm, comments entered in the chat are not part of the record.

2704
04:32:30,803 --> 04:32:32,583
[SPEAKER_17]: So if people are going to

2705
04:32:33,232 --> 04:32:33,872
[SPEAKER_17]: view this later.

2706
04:32:33,892 --> 04:32:38,055
[SPEAKER_17]: It might be helpful if we verbalize them.

2707
04:32:38,155 --> 04:32:41,037
[SPEAKER_20]: I can read that.

2708
04:32:42,878 --> 04:32:43,358
[SPEAKER_20]: Thanks, Peter.

2709
04:32:43,979 --> 04:32:44,219
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

2710
04:32:45,120 --> 04:32:54,906
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, Todd commented that angle doesn't work as well with the shared scenario because the angle requires adjacent traffic flow in a certain direction.

2711
04:32:55,968 --> 04:33:08,452
[SPEAKER_11]: And also it's said that night parallel parking can go as low as 20 feet aisle as opposed to 24, but the fire department usually has reservations about widths in that scenario.

2712
04:33:10,853 --> 04:33:14,794
[SPEAKER_20]: Sounds like both of those would need to be assessed via a study.

2713
04:33:14,814 --> 04:33:25,117
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, I think- Brian, what would be at the end of those parking spaces along the property line?

2714
04:33:26,125 --> 04:33:26,985
[SPEAKER_18]: Would there be a fence?

2715
04:33:27,205 --> 04:33:29,246
[SPEAKER_18]: Would you do wheel stops, which are not great?

2716
04:33:29,266 --> 04:33:32,746
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a retaining wall, I think.

2717
04:33:33,126 --> 04:33:36,527
[SPEAKER_10]: Or is it holding up against retaining the wall on the other side?

2718
04:33:36,867 --> 04:33:38,007
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, it would be a fence.

2719
04:33:42,268 --> 04:33:48,469
[SPEAKER_20]: It'd be a fence until 134 Mysticsville.

2720
04:33:48,769 --> 04:33:50,009
[SPEAKER_20]: I think it's the present condition.

2721
04:33:51,029 --> 04:33:51,890
[SPEAKER_20]: Maybe a different fence.

2722
04:33:52,310 --> 04:33:53,750
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, there's a fence there now.

2723
04:33:56,137 --> 04:34:04,365
[SPEAKER_20]: There's nothing and there's nothing in our code Alicia that says you can't park against the property line.

2724
04:34:06,847 --> 04:34:07,288
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I don't.

2725
04:34:07,988 --> 04:34:12,293
[SPEAKER_12]: Right now I have to ask Danielle because she's been going through this with a fine tooth comb.

2726
04:34:13,934 --> 04:34:15,115
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, there's supposed to be a buffer.

2727
04:34:15,396 --> 04:34:17,738
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, this landscape buffer is not something we're making up.

2728
04:34:21,974 --> 04:34:29,236
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, not that Medford's, it's pretty common in other zoning codes to have a minimum certain buffer.

2729
04:34:30,256 --> 04:34:32,156
[SPEAKER_07]: I couldn't say if Medford's does or not.

2730
04:34:32,616 --> 04:34:40,898
[SPEAKER_12]: The first buffer that I come to is one that's screening between residential or non-residential use against a residential use.

2731
04:34:43,099 --> 04:34:47,100
[SPEAKER_12]: And then the next one is the large parking areas issue.

2732
04:34:49,611 --> 04:34:56,413
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's Alicia clarify that's not a buffer, that's the large parking areas with the one tree for 10.

2733
04:34:57,174 --> 04:34:57,494
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

2734
04:34:58,214 --> 04:34:59,354
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

2735
04:34:59,434 --> 04:35:14,419
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of our landscaping and parking requirements overlap and are some things that are that address landscaping for specifically for parking will be completely somewhere else than you would expect them to be.

2736
04:35:14,999 --> 04:35:16,040
[SPEAKER_10]: It gets really it's.

2737
04:35:19,873 --> 04:35:24,078
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not intuitive and it's not easy to find some of these buried provisions.

2738
04:35:31,864 --> 04:35:49,157
[SPEAKER_12]: Right, this is we're coming back to the, the issue that a lot of these were put in by the, all of these provisions were put in by the lawyer, this board reviewed split them up and reviewed them but we didn't actually have any consultants weigh in on that.

2739
04:35:49,678 --> 04:35:57,084
[SPEAKER_12]: This is where I'm, we're working now with the city council to bring in some consultants to actually look at zoning in a bigger picture way.

2740
04:36:01,857 --> 04:36:07,442
[SPEAKER_20]: These are not long standing, all is what I was trying to say all of this is relatively new in our zoning.

2741
04:36:10,804 --> 04:36:13,467
[SPEAKER_20]: Mr. Chair, does anyone have any additional questions for me.

2742
04:36:15,989 --> 04:36:20,653
[SPEAKER_20]: While you are you also in City Hall Todd.

2743
04:36:21,493 --> 04:36:24,116
[SPEAKER_10]: So, really wish I went home that's all I'm saying.

2744
04:36:26,197 --> 04:36:29,460
[SPEAKER_07]: I just hope and even establishment is still open.

2745
04:36:38,479 --> 04:36:46,226
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, we're either gonna have to continue or I'm just gonna have to leave.

2746
04:36:46,486 --> 04:36:48,468
[SPEAKER_08]: I've already missed the last train out of Boston.

2747
04:36:49,268 --> 04:36:52,231
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'll be waking my wife up to come pick me up.

2748
04:36:52,251 --> 04:36:58,777
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm gonna- I'll make a motion to continue to next week if that's what we need.

2749
04:36:58,797 --> 04:37:03,461
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a second?

2750
04:37:04,274 --> 04:37:09,157
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll second that we are not going to get anywhere productive at the moment, unfortunately.

2751
04:37:09,537 --> 04:37:09,737
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

2752
04:37:11,918 --> 04:37:14,819
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, make sure I get everybody on a roll call.

2753
04:37:20,342 --> 04:37:22,783
[SPEAKER_08]: Jackie is accused.

2754
04:37:23,964 --> 04:37:25,084
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, Clayson Jason.

2755
04:37:25,445 --> 04:37:27,425
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes, sorry I'm accused.

2756
04:37:28,406 --> 04:37:30,167
[SPEAKER_08]: It's okay, you're there.

2757
04:37:33,883 --> 04:37:34,383
[SPEAKER_08]: and Emily.

2758
04:37:35,284 --> 04:37:35,524
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes.

2759
04:37:36,284 --> 04:37:36,724
[SPEAKER_08]: And Peter.

2760
04:37:37,584 --> 04:37:37,804
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

2761
04:37:38,945 --> 04:37:39,545
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you still there?

2762
04:37:40,745 --> 04:37:40,905
[SPEAKER_27]: Yep.

2763
04:37:41,085 --> 04:37:43,666
[SPEAKER_27]: My zoom crashed, but been here.

2764
04:37:43,946 --> 04:37:44,166
[SPEAKER_27]: Yep.

2765
04:37:45,207 --> 04:37:45,467
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

2766
04:37:45,547 --> 04:37:47,207
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you in favor of the continuance?

2767
04:37:48,208 --> 04:37:50,829
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's our only option right now.

2768
04:37:50,889 --> 04:37:51,049
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

2769
04:37:51,769 --> 04:37:52,029
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

2770
04:37:52,269 --> 04:37:53,189
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm a yes as well.

2771
04:37:54,270 --> 04:37:55,350
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll pick it up next week.

2772
04:38:00,452 --> 04:38:03,653
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, we weren't able to come to a full resolution on this tonight.

2773
04:38:06,170 --> 04:38:09,013
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we dare do anything else or do we go right to adjournment?

2774
04:38:11,275 --> 04:38:13,317
[SPEAKER_17]: We're meeting next week, maybe adjournments best.

2775
04:38:15,138 --> 04:38:16,579
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, I'll make a motion.

2776
04:38:18,761 --> 04:38:19,142
[SPEAKER_17]: Second.

2777
04:38:19,162 --> 04:38:31,713
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, um, so I will ask all those in favor of putting the approval of minutes on for next week and continuing the meeting, trying to do two for one here.

2778
04:38:34,738 --> 04:38:35,881
[SPEAKER_08]: Just say aye when I call.

2779
