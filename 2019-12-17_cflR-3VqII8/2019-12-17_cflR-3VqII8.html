    <p>[SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=488.638s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=496.184s">Yes,</a>  seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=498.046s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=499.126s">Report</a>  of secretary. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=500.047s">None.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=501.734s">Report</a>  of committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=502.635s">There</a>  is an agenda for the rules subcommittee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=505.898s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=506.139s">Kreatz,</a>  chairperson.</p>

    <p>[Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=506.959s">The</a>  rules subcommittee had a meeting this evening at 6.30 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=513.726s">and</a>  we met to vote and vote on the member public schools attendance policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=520.493s">What</a>  I can give everybody in their packets, everybody received over the weekend, <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=525.758s">Some</a>  documents, three documents. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=527.039s">The</a>  first document was the Medford Public Schools attendance policy that is currently on the MAS website. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=533.481s">The</a>  second document is the attendance policy that we received from the MASC, which is their updated policy dated February 2019. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=542.503s">We</a>  use this policy as a guideline when updating the Medford Public Schools attendance policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=548.103s">The</a>  MASE attendance policy is adopted by neighboring districts such as Seminole, Winchester, and several other districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=555.828s">The</a>  third document in your packet is the proposed updated member public schools policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=561.131s">I'm</a>  just going to summarize some of the updates that are in <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=564.863s">the</a>  policy that's the last, the third document in your packet. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=568.584s">So</a>  the school committee had, I'm sorry, not the school committee, the subcommittee had a meeting earlier in, at the end of October, and we went with all the administrators, and we, after that meeting, Paul Russo got in touch with Jim Hardy at the MASC, and he asked the MASC if they could share their attendance policy with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=591.894s">So</a>  Paul got that document from Jim Hardy. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=595.077s">We</a>  made just a few changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=597.6s">We</a>  added the word caregivers to all the paragraphs throughout the document wherever you see parents, guardians, wherever that's referenced you'll see caregivers as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=605.968s">We</a>  separated the section unexcused absence so it stands out. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=609.772s">Additionally</a>  the language was updated to show the new verbiage discussed in the subcommittee meeting on 10.1. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=616.015s">stating</a>  the consequences for unexcused absences are limited to the same day restrictions on participation in extracurricular activities. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=624.481s">Lastly,</a>  a policy information section was added at the bottom left-hand corner of the document. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=629.745s">so</a>  we can track the version, date, and approved policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=632.969s">Going</a>  forward, this is something that will appear on all newly updated policies. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=639.497s">The</a>  document was reviewed by each principal at each school, as well as the superintendent, Dr. Edouard-Vincent, associate superintendent Peter Cushing, <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=649.809s">Associate</a>  Superintendent Diane Caldwell, Headmaster DeLeva. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=654.011s">We</a>  shared this document with everybody, including all the original attendees at the October 1st meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=662.056s">So</a>  they all received and reviewed the document electronically via Google Docs, and they made suggestions, comments, or updates as needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=670.54s">So</a>  what you're looking at is the proposed <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=674.976s">updated</a>  Medford Public Schools attendance policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=678.198s">At</a>  our subcommittee meeting this evening, there was just one minor update. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=683.282s">So</a>  if you pull out the, I guess I numbered the pages, so it's the fourth page, I think, in your document. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=690.888s">So</a>  the last paragraph on the fourth page <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=694.29s">That</a>  last paragraph where it says each principal or designee will notify a student's parent, guardian, caregiver within three, we added the word school during our subcommittee meeting, school days of the student's absence in the event the parent, caregiver has not informed the school's absence. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=711.254s">So</a>  that was the one minor update. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=713.755s">And</a>  the attendance policy was I motion to accept to move over to the regular committee tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=720.256s">And</a>  Mr. Russo seconded. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=724.497s">At</a>  this time, I'd like to make a motion to approve this document so that we can get this posted on the Medford Public Schools website and then share with the MASC as our new updated policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=737.087s">so</a>  they can put the updated policy on their website.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=740.21s">Chairperson</a>  Kreatz, was there a vote in your subcommittee meeting?</p>

    <p>[Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=742.792s">Oh,</a>  yes, there was, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=744.053s">And</a>  I'm sorry, I didn't say that, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=745.835s">That's</a>  okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=746.556s">So</a>  there was a vote, and there was none in the affirmative, I'm sorry, two in the affirmative, zero negative, and there was one absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=757.646s">So</a>  it was the motion passed.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=760.101s">Very</a>  good.</p>

    <p>[Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=760.522s">Nice</a>  job. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=761.403s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=762.484s">There's</a>  a motion on the floor for acceptance of the policy as amended. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=765.327s">Is</a>  there a second? <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=766.689s">Second</a>  by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=767.39s">Vandekloot.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=768.471s">Roll</a>  call vote, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=769.732s">Unless</a>  there's a discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=770.734s">Does</a>  anybody? <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=771.555s">No</a>  one's blinking up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=772.556s">All</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=774.057s">Roll</a>  call vote, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=777.101s">Yes</a>  seven in the affirmative zero in the negative motion passes rule is adopted Thank You chairperson and members of the committee did an outstanding job Okay, thank you <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=793.374s">Okay,</a>  at this time we'd like to announce we have two school committee persons elect in the audience. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=798.26s">We</a>  have Jenny Graham and we have Melanie McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=800.623s">If</a>  you'd like to come into behind the rail and sit with us, please feel free to. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=805.329s">And</a>  we just want to congratulate you and wish you the luck in the next two years.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=823.628s">Welcome.</a> </p>

    <p>[Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=825.149s">Welcome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=825.57s">Come</a>  on over.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=826.03s">At</a>  this time, it is community participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=828.652s">I</a>  believe we have <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=853.493s">the</a>  principal of Medford High School, Mr. DeLiva in the audience, who would like to address this body. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=861.494s">Oh,</a>  let me put you on.</p>

    <p>[D'Alleva]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=866.725s">Good</a>  evening, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=868.126s">I</a>  know I'm coming in on community participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=871.148s">I</a>  just wanted to acknowledge a lot of people, as you guys know, the things that were going on this past weekend regarding our boys' soccer team. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=880.954s">And</a>  there was a lot of pieces that were involved to get where we got on Saturday. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=886.457s">I</a>  received two letters, and I just wanted to make it known. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=889.679s">One</a>  by the Greater Boston League, as you know that we've reformed the Greater Boston League. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=896.523s">wrote</a>  a letter in support of the Medford High School boys soccer team, and if it's okay, I could just read the letter briefly. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=903.789s">MIA</a>  Board of Directors, I ask that you receive this letter as a show of support for the Medford High School and their efforts to provide their student-athletes with an equitable opportunity to participate in the Division I North Sectional Boys Soccer Final. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=917.879s">To</a>  be blunt, the issue that occurred is one that urban schools deal with on a regular basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=923.123s">Far</a>  too often, we have students that arrive at our schools that have experienced trauma and the results of having to leave school. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=929.548s">One</a>  of our main goals is to recapture these students. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=932.45s">In</a>  many cases, the trail of documentation is hard to navigate. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=935.892s">Some</a>  students have been to multiple schools in multiple cities, states, and countries. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=940.616s">They</a>  are age appropriate, credit appropriate, and fit easily into a specific grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=945.439s">We</a>  feel that this situation has drastically higher rate of occurrence in urban schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=949.843s">In</a>  this case, we feel that the circumstances that are related to the ineligible player are directly related to his life situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=957.09s">The</a>  principals and athletic directors of the Greater Boston League support Medford High School and their efforts that they are taking to rectify the situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=965.677s">We</a>  feel strongly that the decision should be overturned. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=968.74s">and</a>  the team, as well as the players, should be allowed to participate in the boys' state soccer tournament. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=973.524s">Thank</a>  you for ensuring the efforts of our student-athletes receive an equitable opportunity to participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=978.729s">And</a>  that was from the Greater Boston League president, Chris Messerangelo, the principal of Malden High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=984.433s">So</a>  I wanted to also put that in record. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=985.995s">And</a>  we also received a letter from the superintendent of Malden as well, writing to the MIA regarding the situation, which, if it's okay, I could read that letter as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=997.485s">I'm</a>  writing as a school superintendent and former high school principal to urge you to reconsider the decision which was ruled that Medford High School soccer player ineligible. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1007.354s">This</a>  ruling is unfair and the timing tragically paralyzes the team and the player. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1012.558s">The</a>  student athlete, an 18-year-old who played two years prior to school dropped out of school <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1017.142s">became</a>  homeless and then re-enrolled in Medford High School as a junior in February of 2019. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1022.704s">He</a>  was homeless living with a relative and began to recover his lost school credits. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1027.305s">This</a>  student is 18 and had only been in school in four years and only played two years of soccer. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1032.146s">This</a>  is nothing in the school's profile which would have raised a cause concerned about his eligibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1037.388s">There</a>  were many causes for concern in his profile as a student of color, homeless, undercredit, and had already dropped out to help support his family. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1045.79s">The</a>  student-athlete was, as we most likely see in urban districts, a successful re-engaged student. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1051.474s">We</a>  do this on a daily basis in our urban communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1054.656s">We</a>  as educational leaders seek to give our students every opportunity to succeed, despite the mainly deeply concerning challenges that our students battle, most of which is beyond their control. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1065.069s">The</a>  MIA is supposed to serve all students in all communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1067.831s">I've</a>  appealed to the MIA in the past as a principal and lead president for help. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1072.053s">We</a>  felt neglected and left out of our pleas, which were uniquely urban minority majority schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1078.037s">We've</a>  experienced biases and prejudices from the board members during our process. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1082.14s">Unfortunately,</a>  this incident involving this student athlete has the same familiar ring of injustice and bias. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1088.063s">The</a>  MIA has an opportunity to rectify the situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1091.188s">It</a>  is time for the MIA to reverse its decision and allow for the Medford High School student-athlete to play and let the Medford continue its season. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1097.938s">This</a>  time is now. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1099.219s">Make</a>  the situation right. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1101.162s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1101.503s">And</a>  that's from John Oteri, the superintendent of schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1104.523s">in</a>  Malden, so I would just like to take the community participation time to thank a lot of people, because it had been a very trying day, and I actually want to specifically thank the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1115.97s">There</a>  were times that I would even say that I was waffling at some point, because it just was getting to be a little bit overwhelming, basing on rules and things like that, but our mayor was very adamant of pushing for our students to play, and I think that should be recognized here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1130.999s">There's</a>  a lot of people, Dr. Peter Cushing, <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1133.62s">Athletic</a>  director Bobby Maloney Just a lot of people at the table just trying to figure out figure out and figure out So I just wanted to personally thank them in front of this committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1143.563s">So</a>  thank you everybody.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1145.084s">Thank</a>  you very much Writers of those letters from the school committee members thanking them for weighing in on behalf of our students I</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1160.072s">Also,</a>  if I could, the mayor of Cambridge was involved in this, the mayor of Somerville took an active interest in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1166.057s">We</a>  reached out to a lot of different entities over the course of Thursday afternoon when we got the original ruling, and Friday evening when they did their second re-look at the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1176.266s">And,</a>  you know, rules are great, but sometimes they don't fit. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1179.408s">Everybody</a>  doesn't fit into that box. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1181.25s">And</a>  that's when you expect a board of their caliber to make those kinds of decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1186.842s">that</a>  everyone can live with and not an unfair, unjust decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1190.425s">And</a>  what they did is they just corroborated, collaborated together. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1194.047s">And</a>  we heard it on the phone when we were on the phone with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1196.809s">And</a>  I must say, I felt so terrible listening to the conversations that were on the other end of that line. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1202.513s">And</a>  I'm appalled at the MIAA once again. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1205.796s">It's</a>  not the first time. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1206.836s">It</a>  probably won't be the last time. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1208.598s">But</a>  I'm appalled once again at their actions and their ability to not look past black and white on a piece of paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1216.316s">But</a>  we fought. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1217.717s">We</a>  fought for you kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1218.637s">I</a>  want you to know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1219.558s">We</a>  weren't giving up. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1220.319s">We</a>  fought the whole time and we said they deserve their day to win or lose on the field because that's the right thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1227.304s">We</a>  put everything behind and we said we're just pushing ahead and we're going to the courts because if MIA can't make the right decision, we're going to go to an unbiased individual to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1236.771s">That's</a>  what we did. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1237.692s">Thank</a>  goodness there was a judge that stayed around past closing time on Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1242.195s">I</a>  want to thank the clerk of courts. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1243.776s">for</a>  keeping the courtroom open because MIA got us off the phone at 4.35 when the courts closed at 4.30, didn't make a decision, didn't inform us, made a decision, leaked it to the Herald, won. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1256.66s">And</a>  the clerks that stayed there as well as the judge that stayed there. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1261.001s">And</a>  so thank them all for doing their job on Friday evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1266.455s">As</a>  you can tell, I'm still heated about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1268.176s">I'm</a>  sorry.</p>

    <p>[D'Alleva]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1270.297s">But</a>  it couldn't have been done if it wasn't a team effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1272.878s">And</a>  I just wanted to acknowledge the people that really came in and really did their best to, you know, there's a lot of people in a room sometimes.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1280.601s">They</a>  did what was right.</p>

    <p>[D'Alleva]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1281.661s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1282.081s">And</a>  the driving force had been, it was always about the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1286.263s">No</a>  matter what, that's what the rule was or whatever it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1289.684s">It</a>  was always about the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1290.825s">And</a>  that was the main thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1292.306s">And</a>  again, I really have to thank the mayor because there were times we were like, <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1296.763s">What</a>  are we going to do here? <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1298.364s">And</a>  the superintendent, of course, as well, I'm sorry.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1301.084s">And</a>  regardless of the outcome, they're winners.</p>

    <p>[D'Alleva]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1303.045s">Yes,</a>  exactly. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1303.525s">They</a>  are winners in our book. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1305.026s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1305.346s">So</a>  who goes to the boys' volleyball team?</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1306.826s">Thank</a>  you, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1311.208s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1315.388s">Item</a>  one, superintendent's update and comments.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1319.631s">So</a>  I, too, was going to take a little bit of time to talk about our boys' soccer, because that was kind of top of mind for the past few days. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1331.299s">And</a>  I want to just share some of my reflections and thoughts with you and tell you what's happening in the wonderful Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1339.882s">So</a>  as you heard from Headmaster DeLeva, the wonderful letters of support that we received, these are a few reflections. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1350.966s">So</a>  a tremendous team that this community was happy to support for their great athletic achievements, but also for the upstanding way they carried themselves all year. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1365.251s">We</a>  talk a lot about the importance of the Mustang Way, <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1369.598s">while</a>  these players exemplified it every time they took the field. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1375.062s">They</a>  never dropped the ball. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1377.463s">We</a>  did as the adults. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1380.005s">So</a>  I truly felt that they should not have to pay the price for a no malice clerical error on our part. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1388.711s">Despite</a>  working for two long days pleading our case to both the MIAA <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1395.264s">and</a>  the MIAC, they denied our Mustangs the opportunity to play. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1402.308s">Mayor</a>  Burke, Athletic Director Bobby Maloney, Headmaster DeLeva, and many members of my team, we felt that this was an unfair decision for our students and took the MIAA to court to fight. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1418.596s">It</a>  was the right thing to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1421.955s">The</a>  court found in Medford's favor and the game was played on Saturday night. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1428.639s">A</a>  very evenly matched game, if I say so myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1433.401s">The</a>  Mustangs left it all on the field. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1437.244s">I</a>  also say hats off to Lincoln Sudbury. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1442.447s">They</a>  were not victorious, our Mustangs, but they were victorious in our hearts for never giving up. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1449.62s">Mustang</a>  Country made up three quarters of the crowd, and Medford represented strongly. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1456.768s">I</a>  felt like I was at a World Cup event, although I wasn't Lynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1462.734s">The</a>  atmosphere was electric. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1465.297s">Mustang</a>  Country chanted and cheered throughout the whole match. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1473.373s">The</a>  MIAA stated that they felt badly that a clerical error had brought them to this decision, but that rules were made to be followed. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1482.696s">I</a>  do agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1484.216s">However,</a>  sometimes before a rule is applied, extenuating circumstances should be taken into account. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1492.859s">In</a>  this case, I wonder if Medford's team was afforded fair consideration for all of the circumstances we presented. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1503.278s">Sometimes</a>  the answer to every question may not be a yes or a no, but instead it might be maybe, or let's look more completely into this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1516.088s">At</a>  times we might ask to relook at an issue so that every individual feels that their predicament was heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1524.755s">Well,</a>  what I can say this evening, <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1526.944s">We</a>  are so truly, truly appreciative of all the support Medford received from Mayor Burke, from the School Committee, from the City Council, the GBL League, Somerville Mayor Joe Curtatone, Cambridge Mayor, Malden Public Schools Superintendent John Oteri, <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1548.352s">whose</a>  letter was read to you just a moment ago by Headmaster DeLeva. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1552.254s">I</a>  want you to know Superintendent John O'Teary stood by my side and Dr. Peter Cushing the whole entire game, cheering on Medford Mustangs. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1566.003s">I</a>  want to thank the 5,786 people and counting, family, friends, neighbors, and supporters of the Mustang boys soccer team who signed the change.org <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1578.483s">on</a>  petition for them to be able to play. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1582.165s">The</a>  entire community was Medford strong and rallied behind our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1588.667s">Lastly,</a>  we must thank our school committee attorney, Howard Greenspan, and our attorney who fought the MIAA for the students to be able to play, attorney John J. Jack McGlynn, Jr., and his law firm of McGlynn & McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1604.873s">Attorney</a>  McGlynn represented us strongly and successfully, and so I'm so grateful that we were able to play on Saturday and give it our best shot. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1616.286s">So</a>  I just wanted to share those remarks with you regarding <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1620.028s">our</a>  soccer extravaganza the past few days. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1624.229s">But</a>  as I transition from that, I wanna just let you know or share with you what else is happening in Medford, and there's a lot happening in Medford, so I wanna just try to go through these other updates so you're just aware. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1637.093s">First</a>  thing, this coming Thursday, there's a very important traffic notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1643.395s">Eversource</a>  is closing South Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1646.973s">And</a>  this impacts us and it impacts our school buses. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1651.457s">So</a>  everyone needs to know school bus route 13 and route 12, Maple Street at South Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1660.244s">Students</a>  will not be able to use that stop anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1663.247s">Students</a>  are going to walk down to Winthrop at South Street near Goldilocks Bagels. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1670.22s">to</a>  board the bus in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1672.421s">And</a>  in the afternoon, they'll be dropped off at that same spot, Winthrop Street at South Street, very close to the Goldilocks Bagels. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1683.768s">Another</a>  route, any other route using Winthrop Street will have to use Route 16 to get to the middle and elementary schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1691.594s">So</a>  as you know, Route 16 has a lot of congestion, so it's going to be a longer commute, and we'll have to figure out the times, but I just want to, you know, prepare everyone in advance that the street is closing, so we have to be prepared for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1711.576s">On</a>  the high school level, we have had a few technology glitches. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1715.28s">We</a>  got a few emails and some questions about what's happening with technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1721.045s">So</a>  we are actively working on fixing our technology at the high school in particular. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1727.691s">The</a>  system, there are multiple systems going on to the device. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1731.452s">Everyone</a>  is traveling with a mobile device and all of those devices logging on to our one system. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1738.974s">It's</a>  also sometimes overwhelming our system. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1741.875s">So</a>  we are working on a fix for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1744.095s">So</a>  I just want you to know we are aware and we are working and meeting collaboratively to come up with solutions to help our technology challenges at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1754.919s">Transitioning</a>  again, middle school winter sports. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1758.182s">Just</a>  so you know, those of us who love our athletic events, after a very competitive fall season, middle school sports, winter season is starting. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1768.031s">Boys</a>  and girls basketball tryouts were held last week, and they're going to begin their season the week of December 9th. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1778.22s">Also,</a>  last week, <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1779.9s">Medford</a>  CPAC group and the Medford Family Network co-hosted a presentation supporting students with food allergies in schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1789.623s">I</a>  was pleased to attend this important informational session at the Andrews Middle School. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1795.227s">Over</a>  50 people were in attendance to hear Dr. Michael Kistner of Massachusetts General Hospital for Children and Dr. Jennifer Labovodich of Boston Children's Hospital, who discussed strategies so all of us are aware of student allergy issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1814.319s">The</a>  doctors also stressed the need for supportive classroom environments and having strong emergency care plans in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1823.284s">For</a>  those who are interested but may have missed the presentation, it is available on the school blog. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1829.707s">And</a>  I'd like to recognize assistant superintendent Dr. Cushing and school committee members Van der Kloot and Kreatz were also in attendance at that presentation last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1841.717s">Also,</a>  we had Jumpstart Read for the Record. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1844.958s">That</a>  was held last week at the Columbus School. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1847.88s">The</a>  book that everyone read was Thank You, Omu. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1851.721s">This</a>  year, Jumpstart celebrated its 14th anniversary of Read for the Record. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1858.024s">I</a>  know Dr. Kathy Kaye was very appreciative that Associate Superintendent Diane Caldwell, Assistant Superintendent of Finance Christine Patterson, McGlynn Middle School Principal Nick Tucci, and Director of English Language Arts and Humanity Dr. Nicole Chiesa, Director of Medford Family Network Marie Cassidy, <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1879.193s">and</a>  school committee members Kathy Krutz and Mia Mastone participated in reading the books to students. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1885.599s">Jumpstart's</a>  Read for the Record campaign highlights the importance of building literacy and language skills for every child. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1895.13s">We</a>  have good news again in Mustang country. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1899.252s">A</a>  new graduate, a student who just graduated in June 2019, my first official graduating class. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1908.136s">Well,</a>  this freshman is already making a tremendous, tremendous mark in the world. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1913.779s">His</a>  name is Connor McFarlane, a 2019 high school graduate. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1919.762s">He</a>  won first place <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1922.095s">first</a>  place in the University of Massachusetts at Amherst Innovation Challenge. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1928.982s">Connor,</a>  a chemical engineering student, developed the improved insulin delivery. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1937.231s">It's</a>  called an IID. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1939.92s">An</a>  IID is an improved insulin delivery system for all insulin dependent diabetics that reduces pain, plastic waste, the amount of supplies needed to carry, and the amount of time spent managing the disease, allowing for more freedom for the patient. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1959.995s">His</a>  project was awarded first place and audience choice <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1964.625s">for</a>  a prize of $1,250. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1965.966s">I</a>  just want to say congratulations, Connor. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1971.028s">We</a>  Mustangs are so proud of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1981.292s">We</a>  also had a groundbreaking or a partial groundbreaking held for our new cosmetology salon. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1988.683s">at</a>  the Medford Vocational Technical High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1991.384s">Last</a>  year, in a coordinated effort between the Medford School Committee member, Mia Mastone, City Solicitor, Mark Rumley, and Vocational Principal, Chad Fallon, Medford alumnus, Charles Hoff, explored the opportunity to donate a gift to the school in memory of his mother. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2013.964s">Principal</a>  Fallon shared with Mr. Hoff his vision to relocate the cosmetology program, which is currently located in the lower level of the school and not necessarily really accessible for everyone to the main level of the vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2030.517s">We</a>  feel that it will allow a more direct access point and ample parking for <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2037.052s">clients,</a>  as well as people who would like to visit the salon, visit our bistro, our restaurant, and our automotive technology program. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2046.239s">So</a>  that project, you'll hear about it again later today, but the hope is that it will be completed in the spring of 2020, around May. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2056.027s">So</a>  we're excited about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2057.549s">And</a>  there will be a formal ribbon cutting in May of 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2062.973s">Sandy</a>  Hook Promise presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2066.142s">The</a>  Medford Public Schools partnered with Sandy Hook Promise through a grant funded by the Attorney General's office to provide mental health training, suicide prevention, and school-based violence prevention programs to keep our students safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2082.99s">The</a>  presentation, Start with Hello, was held last week at both the Andrews and McGlynn Middle Schools as well as the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2091.657s">The</a>  Attorney General's Office and Sandy Hook Promise will collaborate with the Medford Public Schools to train educators and students over the course of the next two years in the three Know the Signs programs, which will teach youth and adults how to identify, assess, and intervene before a young person hurts themselves or others. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2115.385s">Special</a>  thanks to Stacey Shulman for applying for this important grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2121.008s">And</a>  as I come to an end, very close, I wanna recognize our fine arts department. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2126.151s">Those</a>  of you who love the arts, we all do. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2128.372s">They</a>  have announced their winter concert schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2131.954s">Everything</a>  will be taking place at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2135.096s">Everyone</a>  is invited. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2136.857s">December</a>  4th, high school chorus, senior string ensemble, and Robert's Hand Chimes. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2143.361s">December</a>  5th, high school orchestra. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2146.403s">December</a>  12th, middle school strings. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2149.905s">That</a>  one says at the McGlynn School. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2152.107s">January</a>  21st, grade five strings, Troublemakers chorus and Roberts hand chimes, and January 22nd, high school band and middle school band. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2163.595s">We'll</a>  continue to give reminders, but just for people to know, Winter Fine Arts Department has the winter concert schedule available. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2173.002s">Also,</a>  our high school band will be selling Christmas trees and reefs in the high school parking lot as a fundraiser to help prepare for our trip 2020 to Pearl Harbor, which is going to be a very costly trip for our band to go all the way to Hawaii. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2191.079s">So</a>  please, that is going to start the weekend of November 29th, right after Thanksgiving weekend, so I do hope <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2198.127s">that</a>  you are able to support that. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2201.548s">Lastly,</a>  our Medford Family Network is hosting a coat drive throughout this entire month. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2208.409s">Please,</a>  if anyone has gently worn clothing, coats or jackets that they wanna donate to the Medford Family Network, please bring it to the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2219.411s">Your</a>  donations would be greatly appreciated. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2221.912s">I</a>  thank you for listening, and I wish you all an early, happy Thanksgiving.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2226.033s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2227.633s">Mr..</a>  Russo Thank you for that report. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2230.879s">I</a>  just had a quick Question about two questions one the South Street closure Do we have a how long that's gonna last?</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2240.625s">I</a>  don't have the official timetable. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2245.307s">I</a>  do know that it's closing officially on the 21st, and we will definitely be in close communication with Eversource. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2254.69s">Again,</a>  sometimes when they dig or whatever they do, they find other challenges. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2260.833s">Like</a>  on Winthrop Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2263.554s">But</a>  we definitely have been communicating. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2266.675s">We've</a>  been in early communication with the bus company. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2270.527s">and</a>  just wanting to let people know that this is happening and there will be additional</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2279.155s">So</a>  it's not a week.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2280.116s">We</a>  can get an estimate of the timeline and email everyone and get it out to your groups.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2284.957s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2285.537s">And</a>  then I just wanted for clarification, since I know this, but I just wanted to make sure everybody else did. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2290.539s">When</a>  you were talking about the technology at the high school, you were specifically talking about the internet connections. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2295.641s">Exactly,</a>  yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2296.321s">You</a>  didn't mention the word internet, and I just wanted to make sure that got included. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2298.822s">Yes,</a>  yes, yes.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2299.302s">It</a>  was about the internet connections where our system's been crashing. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2305.564s">So</a>  we've been working on that, we've been meeting and we have some, we'll be able to present out on that sometime next month to give you a more robust update on what's happening with technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2317.288s">But</a>  just to let everyone know that we are definitely aware of the Internet challenges.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2322.81s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2323.45s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2324.794s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2325.014s">DiBenedetto.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2326.014s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2327.035s">To</a>  follow up about South Street, can we make sure that an auto call is sent? <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2332.696s">So</a>  especially with how cold it's been, we don't want to accidentally have any children waiting out there for the bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2340.799s">We</a>  can definitely do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2343.06s">And</a>  just maybe to everyone, because kids might take a bus home to that area to walk to a grandparent's or a caregiver's <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2354.859s">House,</a>  not just the kids that necessarily are living right in that area.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2360.009s">And</a>  we can definitely, if it's not already up on the blog, we'll definitely get it up as well.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2364.377s">And</a>  the Catholic schools that we service. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2368.19s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2368.83s">Definitely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2369.531s">And</a>  just, I don't know if we're gonna discuss it now, but there has been some emails and letters of concerns of bus crowding, but we can wait till further in this meeting, but especially middle school buses being overcrowded at the end of the day, going home now that some clubs have ended. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2391.226s">So</a>  I don't know if you could look into that and get us an update.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2394.968s">Yes,</a>  I can do that.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2396.049s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2396.709s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2397.25s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2399.047s">Item</a>  number two, report on CCSR. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2402.069s">Michael</a>  Skorka and Mr. Richard Trotta.</p>

    <p>[Trotter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2412.395s">Excuse</a>  me, hello. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2413.175s">Hello.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2413.816s">Richard</a>  Trotta. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2415.917s">Welcome</a>  back to school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2419.099s">And</a>  I'm gonna say happy Thanksgiving to the school committee, the new school committee before I forget that. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2424.662s">And</a>  welcome to the new members. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2427.354s">We</a>  did our annual report a while ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2430.358s">We</a>  passed them out this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2432.5s">It's</a>  100 pages long, so I only read 25 pages. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2440.727s">And</a>  the new members, we'll get those to you so you can see what the report says. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2445.769s">So,</a>  what's gonna happen, I'm gonna give a brief comment about the overview and then Michael will talk about the students and their projects and then we'll be all done and take questions also. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2460.794s">So,</a>  first of all, <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2463.338s">Michael</a>  and I want to thank the school committee and central office for continuing to report the support that you've given us over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2470.942s">We</a>  wouldn't be able to do this without your help and so we thank you and look forward to continuing. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2477.406s">Today</a>  I got an interesting email from Cummings Foundation. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2480.788s">We</a>  applied for a sustaining grant for 10 years of $250,000 approximately. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2486.832s">We</a>  didn't get it yet, but we passed the first step. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2489.153s">We're</a>  in the finalists for that grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2492.384s">So</a>  we won't know until spring, but hopefully before budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2500.423s">So</a>  this concept began a long time ago with Roy Bellison. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2503.406s">Basically,</a>  the program is a way of including social-emotional learning and leadership in the schools after school, because it doesn't interfere with the school day. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2516.337s">The</a>  drawback, of course, we don't get every student, but we still have quite a few students. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2521.041s">In</a>  fact, this year, up to over 500 students, K through 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2526.073s">It</a>  began in 2015 and 16, and I did it the first year alone, and I did some odds and ends. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2531.977s">I</a>  didn't have a lot of money left from the Bloomberg grant, and so it was just a number of activities that weren't really that powerful. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2540.082s">But</a>  the next year, we got the Cummings Foundation grant, and also at the same time, I met this gentleman named Michael Skorka, who's sitting next to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2549.181s">He</a>  was the key to getting the students dramatically involved in the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2554.004s">We</a>  started with 18 students at the high school, and now we have 150 this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2559.867s">So</a>  that was in three years, we've gone from 18 to 150 students at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2564.729s">And</a>  district-wide, we went from 18 students to 500. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2567.311s">So</a>  it's been a dramatic increase in participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2572.834s">Now,</a>  let me go on my notes. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2578.163s">So,</a>  in essence, I'm going to state the mission in very simple terms. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2581.886s">It's</a>  to develop student leaders who work to make the community and the world a better place to live. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2588.088s">I</a>  want to make a note, too, that the students do a lot of work to help other people, but the person who gains the most, I really believe, are the students doing the projects, because they become leaders, and you'll see that when they speak, and you also, if you've been to any of our project fairs or events, you'll see the students take a lead, and they complete these projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2607.566s">The</a>  projects are year-long, so it's not just a small project. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2610.869s">It's</a>  pretty complex sometimes. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2612.711s">Sometimes</a>  they have to raise money. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2614.272s">Sometimes</a>  they have to go to the city council or school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2617.014s">Sometimes</a>  they have to plan out with parents and community and do projects with non-profits. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2623.679s">And</a>  they raise money. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2624.459s">Some</a>  students have raised as much as $4,000 last year for the monument to the enslaved people. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2630.944s">The</a>  most important activity <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2634.41s">that</a>  we believe that's critical is the student work. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2637.073s">We</a>  have other things we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2637.913s">We</a>  have speakers. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2638.534s">We</a>  had the poet laureate, Richard Blanco, a few weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2643.238s">This</a>  past week we had Amanda Gorman, who's the youth poet laureate for the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2650.264s">We've</a>  had some speakers come into the schools, like the McGlynn in the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2654.267s">We've</a>  done some professional development. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2655.568s">We've</a>  had some mini grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2656.909s">We've</a>  had resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2658.11s">But</a>  by far and away, the most important thing we do, the most powerful thing we do, <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2662.021s">is</a>  work with students to help them help us. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2665.502s">And</a>  Michael will talk about the students, but I just want to mention the format. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2669.503s">There</a>  is a structure to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2671.744s">The</a>  structure is called project-based learning, where students on their own, with the help of the, they pick their own projects, but the advisors help them implement a project. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2681.407s">So</a>  they have to plan it. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2682.407s">They</a>  have to implement it. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2683.247s">They</a>  have to cooperate. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2684.848s">They</a>  have to communicate. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2686.172s">So</a>  the project is really a powerful tool for learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2689.974s">I</a>  was always a fan of that as an educator, and now we can actually put into effect in this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2696.798s">So</a>  when they're completing with their projects, they have such a sense of satisfaction. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2703.342s">And</a>  it's actually been proven that it's a natural high, that endorphins actually are released when they complete a project. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2708.685s">So</a>  it might be a counterweight to some negative addictions by having a positive addiction. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2716.291s">And</a>  also, there are things called ACEs, which are Adverse Childhood Experiences. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2720.373s">There's</a>  been research on that that correlates with problems growing up in school and living a life. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2728.478s">And</a>  this activity is a counterweight for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2731.259s">It's</a>  a positive way of directing the students to a positive thing to help counterbalance the negative that they've gone through. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2739.804s">And</a>  students who come into this program don't just come in for the projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2742.405s">They</a>  come in for a social aspect, to be with other students, <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2745.948s">They</a>  also come because they got a chance to work with the community and they actually have a place to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2752.473s">We</a>  don't have any requirements whatsoever. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2754.375s">There's</a>  no athletics, there's no grades. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2756.316s">It's</a>  strictly you wanna be with us and you wanna help make the world a better place. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2760.9s">So</a>  I think I've said too much already. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2763.402s">What</a>  I'd like to do now is we'll wait for questions till after Michael speaks and the students, then we can do some questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2769.587s">And</a>  in the meantime, my great partner, Michael Skorka.</p>

    <p>[Skorka]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2774.132s">Thanks,</a>  Rich. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2775.253s">Rich</a>  actually said a lot of what I already have prepared for you tonight, but I just want to reiterate one thing that Rich said. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2782.879s">We</a>  started with 18 students at the high school, and fast forward four years, we have 150 students at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2790.645s">This,</a>  as Rich said, the structure works. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2793.287s">The</a>  students are excited about doing projects even after school is over. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2797.19s">This</a>  program proves that. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2798.291s">They</a>  want to help people. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2799.613s">They</a>  want to be involved in their community. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2801.175s">They</a>  want to make a difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2802.676s">I</a>  have students in my room at 7 o'clock in the morning all the way until 4 at night that are just literally, they are craving that, <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2816.172s">that</a>  drive to help other people. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2819.614s">And</a>  I'm seeing that not only at the high school, but also at the elementary schools and the middle schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2825.638s">We</a>  have, as Rich said, over just about 500 students in the district that are participating in the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2832.823s">And</a>  when I meet with the advisors, we meet monthly to just brainstorm ideas, support one another, talk about fundraisers, talk about how we can support the students, better support them. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2842.329s">And</a>  all of them have told me that this is one of the best experiences they've ever had, to be able to do this work with these students. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2848.212s">And</a>  it's enriching, and we're essentially empowering students to make the world a better place. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2853.075s">And</a>  these skills, they're not only, like Rich said, they're not only learning, they're not only benefiting because they're helping other people, but they're learning life skills. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2860.478s">High</a>  school students, I just had a student who was nervous to make a phone call to a local business because they don't make a lot of phone calls, and so we had to walk through what that looked like, walk through what a formal email looks like. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2871.627s">Those</a>  life skills that they're gonna be able to take with them after they graduate from high school are super important. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2876.871s">So</a>  I'm gonna reiterate also, I'd like to thank every one of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2881.194s">Many</a>  of you were here when this program was merely a concept, and you supported us from the very beginning, and look where we are now. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2887.419s">So</a>  from the bottom of our hearts, <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2889.18s">Thank</a>  you so much, and thank you to Central Administration who has supported us. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2893.304s">It's</a>  been a wild ride in a really awesome way, and I can't wait to see what we do next. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2898.929s">You'll</a>  hear from three student groups tonight who will express not only what the CCSR means to them, but also talk a little bit about their projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2907.137s">So</a>  without further ado, first up is Maria Rocha.</p>

    <p>[Rocha]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2919.935s">Hello,</a>  my name is Maria Rocha and I am the founder and coordinator of the CCSR Tufts QuestBridge Chapter Resource and Mentoring Program. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2929.117s">We</a>  are mentoring 40 plus first generation and low income high school students in skills such as professional development and college readiness in innovative ways such as bi-weekly email newsletters and the opportunity to get their questions answered by real college students who are part of our mentor team through Google Forms. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2950.403s">And</a>  now, one of our mentors would like to share a few words about the importance of our program.</p>

    <p>[6kKbcFkpEqA_SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2957.027s">Hi,</a>  everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2957.828s">I'm</a>  Leticia Rocha. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2958.909s">I</a>  am a senior at Tufts University. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2961.471s">I</a>  was president of the Tufts Quest chapter for two years, and I'm now a member of the mentoring team. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2966.795s">We</a>  work to foster community among first-generation low-income students at Tufts. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2971.599s">And</a>  while we do a lot for them during their time at Tufts, the actual road to college is incredibly difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2976.884s">And</a>  it is crucial that we provide resources for first-generation and low-income high school students <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2982.393s">in</a>  order to get them into higher education and close the achievement gap. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2986.92s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Rocha]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2988.523s">Now</a>  I'd like to introduce Mark Allen and Kishana Paul, who are going to talk about the Haitian Flag Day celebration.</p>

    <p>[Mark Allen]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3001.813s">Well,</a>  to understand where we're going, I must make a quick look back at last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3008.581s">Last</a>  year, we took the passion that many Haitian students felt at our school, and we made the first district-wide Haitian Flag Day assembly and celebration. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3018.373s">So</a>  last year, <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3019.875s">We</a>  had a Haitian flag day assembly where we portrayed our culture and we represented many aspects and the dance, the music. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3026.898s">And</a>  afterwards we also, we also went to the elementary school and middle schools in the morning to share a bit of that passion and talk with the kids, inspire them so they can be proud of their identity and self. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3038.582s">So</a>  I'd like to pass it to Kishana to tell us where we're going.</p>

    <p>[Kishana Paul]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3040.963s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3041.463s">So</a>  after we had our assembly, we had a celebration after school. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3045.843s">So</a>  we had parents and local businesses bring in food. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3048.444s">Some</a>  was donated to us, and everybody experienced Haitian food. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3051.225s">We</a>  had a DJ, which everyone was dancing, and everybody enjoyed. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3055.307s">And</a>  this year, we hope to make it bigger and include more students from Medford High. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3059.789s">So</a>  that's more diverse, and everybody gets to learn about the Haitian culture, not just the Haitians from Medford High in general.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3065.131s">Very</a>  nice.</p>

    <p>[Kishana Paul]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3066.392s">Great</a>  job.</p>

    <p>[Mark Allen]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3069.653s">Now,</a>  I'd like to call some other amazing CCSR members, Jacqueline Madigan and Emily McDade.</p>

    <p>[Jacqueline Madigan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3079.764s">Hello,</a>  good evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3081.245s">My</a>  name is Jacqueline Madigan, and I'm currently a senior at Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3085.427s">I</a>  have been a member of CCSR for two years, and last year I became a project portfolio manager with Emily McDade. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3091.489s">Emily</a>  and I are responsible for assisting Mr. Skorka in the creation of the project portfolios for every school in the district, as well as the mid-year and annual reports, which we report to the Cummings Foundation that are so kind to provide us with things that we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3103.875s">Currently</a>  I am training two sophomores to take on the role after Emily and I graduate. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3109.026s">I</a>  love my role within the CCSR because I get the opportunity to work with and, more importantly, be amazed by varying passions of the different students and their longing to change the world. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3118.912s">CCSR</a>  has taught me the importance of pursuing my passions, being vocal in my beliefs, and collaborating with my peers. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3125.777s">Working</a>  with others to create change under a common goal is extremely powerful and very motivating. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3131.441s">And</a>  to me, that is what makes the CCSR program invaluable to any other program. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3135.882s">These</a>  life skills are fundamental in working towards change and have allowed me to build a strong foundation for college. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3141.19s">I</a>  plan to take what Mr. Skorka and the CCR program has taught me and use it to continue my love of community service in college, and for that I am very grateful.</p>

    <p>[Emily McDade]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3151.325s">Hello</a>  everybody, my name is Emily McDade and I'm also a senior at Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3155.41s">As</a>  Jackie mentioned, Jackie and I are the portfolio managers which we create the annual and mid-year reports. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3162.578s">This</a>  year I am also working with Jackie on Common Ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3166.862s">Common</a>  Ground is a reverse inclusion classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3169.605s">that</a>  allows high school students to form connections with students within the ACCESS program. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3173.91s">The</a>  ACCESS program is a program within Medford High School that allows students with significant disabilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3179.436s">The</a>  goal was to incorporate students in common ground with classroom activities to feel included within the Medford High School community. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3186.837s">Ava</a>  Heinegg, who is not here tonight, Jackie and I worked alongside Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3190.28s">Andre</a>  to create an environment in which the students could participate and feel welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3194.724s">Some</a>  of the different activities included recognizing the uniquenesses of each individual and team building. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3200.649s">We</a>  hope to eventually make common ground available to all students throughout the day, not only just one period a day, so that the students in the access program are more involved in the community <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3209.458s">and</a>  gain relationships that will continue outside of the classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3213.609s">On</a>  behalf of CCSR, we would like to thank everyone for listening to us tonight.</p>

    <p>[Skorka]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3224.392s">So</a>  I am so excited to be able to work with these students. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3229.573s">And</a>  like I said, 150. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3231.554s">Last</a>  year at the high school, we had 58 projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3234.475s">And</a>  we're already up to 80 projects at the high school alone, which is incredible. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3239.876s">And</a>  I know that the work that they're doing is really making a difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3244.758s">This</a>  program really does have an impact on the world and in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3250.299s">Rich,</a>  I don't know if you want to say one more thing.</p>

    <p>[Trotter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3251.821s">I</a>  just want one more informational thing that we actually now incorporated the key club in our group. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3259.348s">They're</a>  going to work with us and help us and we're going to help them so that there's a unified force, so to speak, to do projects and help out the rest of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3268.736s">Do</a>  we have any questions?</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3271.958s">I</a>  think just, well, another shout out to the Cummings Foundation, the Crystal Campbell Betterment.</p>

    <p>[Trotter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3277.16s">Continue</a>  the rest of the Betterment.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3279.241s">Community</a>  Betterment Project. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3280.282s">Community</a>  Benefit Project.</p>

    <p>[Trotter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3282.242s">I</a>  knew there were others. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3283.003s">And</a>  of course, the Bloomberg Foundation that started the organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3286.924s">We're</a>  hoping that he remembers that, too.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3294.448s">First,</a>  I'll start at the top. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3295.608s">I</a>  want to thank you, Michael and Rich, for coming tonight and for updating us. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3300.57s">Of</a>  course, we know what a positive thing this is. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3303.932s">And</a>  as I've been sitting here and reading some of the other projects that happened at the elementary level, something else occurred to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3310.954s">So</a>  first, at the elementary level, I happened to look in my book and one was teal pumpkin awareness for letting the community know more about the teal pumpkins means on Halloween, that there are non-food items available in case kids have allergies. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3328.705s">And</a>  another one, you know, more books for little free libraries. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3332.507s">We</a>  see the little free libraries <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3334.468s">popping</a>  up, but not enough kids books. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3336.049s">So</a>  that was another one. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3337.51s">And</a>  all of a sudden, as I was thinking about this, I was thinking, because of course, we know what fantastic high school projects we've had and how wonderful you just represented yourself. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3348.577s">But</a>  when I go to the music concerts, one of the things I'm always struck about is how when people, students get up at that spring concert, <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3358.843s">They</a>  often thank the music teachers because it is the music teachers who have continuity from the elementary to the middle to the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3368.808s">And</a>  what we've now managed to build with the CCSR is that there's a continuity. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3375.792s">of</a>  ideals going from the elementary to the middle to the high school and soon because of this while the time the kids get to the high school of course we'll always be welcoming more new high school students but we'll also be building the space that will come up <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3391.742s">And</a>  that's an incredibly powerful thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3394.463s">So</a>  I'm very appreciative of the success that we've had and the building that we've done over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3401.544s">I</a>  did just want to mention to Marie, I read an article, I believe it was the Boston Globe, just a week or so ago, talking about how difficult it was that while our students from less <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3415.447s">Students</a>  perhaps who come from families who were their first time college students, while they might get into college, it's difficult for them to stay into college and they're not necessarily prepared for all of the challenges. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3428.05s">And</a>  laying that base now for them to be able to talk to college students is just wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3434.112s">All</a>  of the projects we heard tonight were wonderful and I can't wait to hear about all the other ones that will be happening from all the levels. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3441.613s">Thank</a>  you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3444.751s">Ms.</a> </p>

    <p>[Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3446.532s">Oh,</a>  hi. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3448.574s">Thank</a>  you very much for the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3450.215s">It's</a>  one of my favorite presentations, and the annual report is beautiful. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3454.739s">I</a>  just want to thank the students for the great job and the great work they did. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3458.342s">The</a>  pictures are beautiful, the articles, just perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3461.624s">All</a>  the projects presented tonight were fantastic, and I did what Paulette says, I look forward to <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3467.629s">all</a>  the upcoming events and just going to all the presentations and it's just so wonderful and the kids are so excited and it's so exciting that they're starting in elementary and then going to middle. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3478.179s">I</a>  can't imagine the upcoming years what we're going to see in the upper grades because these children are starting younger now and it's their idea, their vision. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3488.468s">their</a>  voice, and you know, I just heard so many students at the presentations last year, they speak so well, and their leadership skills, and they're great speakers, public speakers, better than me sometimes, so I'm really impressed with the students and all the presentations, and thank you all so much.</p>

    <p>[Trotter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3506.264s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3506.924s">Just</a>  so you know, that the McGlynn Elementary has over 60 students?</p>

    <p>[Skorka]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3510.688s">The</a>  McGlynn Elementary, 66, yeah, I think.</p>

    <p>[Trotter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3512.85s">Elementary</a>  students at one school.</p>

    <p>[Skorka]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3514.551s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3515.812s">And</a>  Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3516.092s">Kreatz</a>  also, and for everyone, the project fair at the high school is scheduled for April 30th, if you wanna put it in your calendars. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3522.875s">I</a>  will also be disseminating the information for the project fairs for the other schools when I have that information, probably sometime in January. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3531.5s">And</a>  Curtis Tufts is also part of this program, just to be very clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3534.721s">They</a>  are participating in the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3536.422s">The</a>  principal, I think she's a new principal, is on board, and we've been in contact, and we're working together to do some projects with her 15 or so students there.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3544.766s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3545.286s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3546.466s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3548.247s">My</a>  question is more about funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3550.147s">This</a>  program is now so important to our community, our school community, as well as our community as a whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3559.33s">If</a>  for any reason this grant doesn't come through, we need to make sure that there's a plan B. I'm sure my colleagues, as the year continues, will help you in the budget if that wasn't to come about. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3573.982s">And</a>  somehow some way, but are there is there a plan B other than the Cummings are we reaching out to? <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3580.285s">Mr.</a>  Bloomberg again, what are we doing?</p>

    <p>[Trotter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3582.667s">Yeah,</a>  one of the things that I do When Michael's working with students is I'm doing outreach all the time whether it's promoting the program Trying to get other districts to buy into it are raising money. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3593.732s">I</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3595.188s">We</a>  have some connections, we have some things going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3597.55s">We're</a>  not going to stop doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3599.011s">There</a>  are other grants, and if it doesn't happen, we'll know before budget so we can think about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3606.216s">But</a>  right now, we won't find out until May, but I think the budget's done in June, so we should be okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3611.94s">But</a>  I'm confident we'll find more money and more support as we go on, <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3616.586s">The</a>  program is becoming more well-known, and I've gone to the conferences, the superintendents' conference, the school committee conference, and I've met people, and I think people are starting to see what we're about at other districts and other funders. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3630.522s">And</a>  I haven't given up on Bloomberg yet, either.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3633.501s">And</a>  what costs are involved? <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3635.263s">Like,</a>  what do you need each year to be able to run this program? <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3638.545s">I</a>  mean, if we put it out there and people are listening and they hear these children, there might be a donor out there that is listening right now or at some point and hear what you need and be able to step up and help us. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3651.617s">So</a>  if anybody's listening, we could use checks for CCSR.</p>

    <p>[Trotter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3655.36s">Yeah,</a>  the biggest item are the stipends for all the advisors and teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3661.795s">Because</a>  we have so many now. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3662.736s">We</a>  have about a dozen. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3664.616s">So</a>  that's the biggest budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3665.657s">The</a>  other things are speakers, sometimes field trips, supplies, printing supplies. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3671.019s">We</a>  do print things. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3672.74s">So</a>  we kind of focused on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3676.482s">We</a>  took some money away from other things to make sure that we have enough money for the advisors and the teachers and some mini grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3684.405s">That's</a>  the bulk of our budget.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3687.146s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3687.506s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3689.067s">School</a>  committee elect McLaughlin.</p>
