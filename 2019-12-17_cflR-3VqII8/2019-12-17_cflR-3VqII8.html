    <p>[SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=488.638s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=496.184s">Yes,</a>  seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=498.046s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=499.126s">Report</a>  of secretary. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=500.047s">None.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=501.734s">Report</a>  of committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=502.635s">There</a>  is an agenda for the rules subcommittee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=505.898s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=506.139s">Kreatz,</a>  chairperson.</p>

    <p>[Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=506.959s">The</a>  rules subcommittee had a meeting this evening at 6.30 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=513.726s">and</a>  we met to vote and vote on the member public schools attendance policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=520.493s">What</a>  I can give everybody in their packets, everybody received over the weekend, <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=525.758s">Some</a>  documents, three documents. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=527.039s">The</a>  first document was the Medford Public Schools attendance policy that is currently on the MAS website. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=533.481s">The</a>  second document is the attendance policy that we received from the MASC, which is their updated policy dated February 2019. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=542.503s">We</a>  use this policy as a guideline when updating the Medford Public Schools attendance policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=548.103s">The</a>  MASE attendance policy is adopted by neighboring districts such as Seminole, Winchester, and several other districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=555.828s">The</a>  third document in your packet is the proposed updated member public schools policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=561.131s">I'm</a>  just going to summarize some of the updates that are in <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=564.863s">the</a>  policy that's the last, the third document in your packet. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=568.584s">So</a>  the school committee had, I'm sorry, not the school committee, the subcommittee had a meeting earlier in, at the end of October, and we went with all the administrators, and we, after that meeting, Paul Russo got in touch with Jim Hardy at the MASC, and he asked the MASC if they could share their attendance policy with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=591.894s">So</a>  Paul got that document from Jim Hardy. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=595.077s">We</a>  made just a few changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=597.6s">We</a>  added the word caregivers to all the paragraphs throughout the document wherever you see parents, guardians, wherever that's referenced you'll see caregivers as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=605.968s">We</a>  separated the section unexcused absence so it stands out. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=609.772s">Additionally</a>  the language was updated to show the new verbiage discussed in the subcommittee meeting on 10.1. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=616.015s">stating</a>  the consequences for unexcused absences are limited to the same day restrictions on participation in extracurricular activities. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=624.481s">Lastly,</a>  a policy information section was added at the bottom left-hand corner of the document. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=629.745s">so</a>  we can track the version, date, and approved policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=632.969s">Going</a>  forward, this is something that will appear on all newly updated policies. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=639.497s">The</a>  document was reviewed by each principal at each school, as well as the superintendent, Dr. Edouard-Vincent, associate superintendent Peter Cushing, <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=649.809s">Associate</a>  Superintendent Diane Caldwell, Headmaster DeLeva. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=654.011s">We</a>  shared this document with everybody, including all the original attendees at the October 1st meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=662.056s">So</a>  they all received and reviewed the document electronically via Google Docs, and they made suggestions, comments, or updates as needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=670.54s">So</a>  what you're looking at is the proposed <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=674.976s">updated</a>  Medford Public Schools attendance policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=678.198s">At</a>  our subcommittee meeting this evening, there was just one minor update. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=683.282s">So</a>  if you pull out the, I guess I numbered the pages, so it's the fourth page, I think, in your document. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=690.888s">So</a>  the last paragraph on the fourth page <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=694.29s">That</a>  last paragraph where it says each principal or designee will notify a student's parent, guardian, caregiver within three, we added the word school during our subcommittee meeting, school days of the student's absence in the event the parent, caregiver has not informed the school's absence. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=711.254s">So</a>  that was the one minor update. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=713.755s">And</a>  the attendance policy was I motion to accept to move over to the regular committee tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=720.256s">And</a>  Mr. Russo seconded. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=724.497s">At</a>  this time, I'd like to make a motion to approve this document so that we can get this posted on the Medford Public Schools website and then share with the MASC as our new updated policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=737.087s">so</a>  they can put the updated policy on their website.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=740.21s">Chairperson</a>  Kreatz, was there a vote in your subcommittee meeting?</p>

    <p>[Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=742.792s">Oh,</a>  yes, there was, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=744.053s">And</a>  I'm sorry, I didn't say that, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=745.835s">That's</a>  okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=746.556s">So</a>  there was a vote, and there was none in the affirmative, I'm sorry, two in the affirmative, zero negative, and there was one absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=757.646s">So</a>  it was the motion passed.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=760.101s">Very</a>  good.</p>

    <p>[Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=760.522s">Nice</a>  job. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=761.403s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=762.484s">There's</a>  a motion on the floor for acceptance of the policy as amended. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=765.327s">Is</a>  there a second? <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=766.689s">Second</a>  by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=767.39s">Vandekloot.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=768.471s">Roll</a>  call vote, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=769.732s">Unless</a>  there's a discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=770.734s">Does</a>  anybody? <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=771.555s">No</a>  one's blinking up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=772.556s">All</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=774.057s">Roll</a>  call vote, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=777.101s">Yes</a>  seven in the affirmative zero in the negative motion passes rule is adopted Thank You chairperson and members of the committee did an outstanding job Okay, thank you <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=793.374s">Okay,</a>  at this time we'd like to announce we have two school committee persons elect in the audience. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=798.26s">We</a>  have Jenny Graham and we have Melanie McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=800.623s">If</a>  you'd like to come into behind the rail and sit with us, please feel free to. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=805.329s">And</a>  we just want to congratulate you and wish you the luck in the next two years.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=823.628s">Welcome.</a> </p>

    <p>[Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=825.149s">Welcome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=825.57s">Come</a>  on over.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=826.03s">At</a>  this time, it is community participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=828.652s">I</a>  believe we have <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=853.493s">the</a>  principal of Medford High School, Mr. DeLiva in the audience, who would like to address this body. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=861.494s">Oh,</a>  let me put you on.</p>

    <p>[D'Alleva]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=866.725s">Good</a>  evening, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=868.126s">I</a>  know I'm coming in on community participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=871.148s">I</a>  just wanted to acknowledge a lot of people, as you guys know, the things that were going on this past weekend regarding our boys' soccer team. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=880.954s">And</a>  there was a lot of pieces that were involved to get where we got on Saturday. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=886.457s">I</a>  received two letters, and I just wanted to make it known. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=889.679s">One</a>  by the Greater Boston League, as you know that we've reformed the Greater Boston League. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=896.523s">wrote</a>  a letter in support of the Medford High School boys soccer team, and if it's okay, I could just read the letter briefly. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=903.789s">MIA</a>  Board of Directors, I ask that you receive this letter as a show of support for the Medford High School and their efforts to provide their student-athletes with an equitable opportunity to participate in the Division I North Sectional Boys Soccer Final. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=917.879s">To</a>  be blunt, the issue that occurred is one that urban schools deal with on a regular basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=923.123s">Far</a>  too often, we have students that arrive at our schools that have experienced trauma and the results of having to leave school. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=929.548s">One</a>  of our main goals is to recapture these students. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=932.45s">In</a>  many cases, the trail of documentation is hard to navigate. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=935.892s">Some</a>  students have been to multiple schools in multiple cities, states, and countries. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=940.616s">They</a>  are age appropriate, credit appropriate, and fit easily into a specific grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=945.439s">We</a>  feel that this situation has drastically higher rate of occurrence in urban schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=949.843s">In</a>  this case, we feel that the circumstances that are related to the ineligible player are directly related to his life situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=957.09s">The</a>  principals and athletic directors of the Greater Boston League support Medford High School and their efforts that they are taking to rectify the situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=965.677s">We</a>  feel strongly that the decision should be overturned. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=968.74s">and</a>  the team, as well as the players, should be allowed to participate in the boys' state soccer tournament. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=973.524s">Thank</a>  you for ensuring the efforts of our student-athletes receive an equitable opportunity to participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=978.729s">And</a>  that was from the Greater Boston League president, Chris Messerangelo, the principal of Malden High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=984.433s">So</a>  I wanted to also put that in record. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=985.995s">And</a>  we also received a letter from the superintendent of Malden as well, writing to the MIA regarding the situation, which, if it's okay, I could read that letter as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=997.485s">I'm</a>  writing as a school superintendent and former high school principal to urge you to reconsider the decision which was ruled that Medford High School soccer player ineligible. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1007.354s">This</a>  ruling is unfair and the timing tragically paralyzes the team and the player. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1012.558s">The</a>  student athlete, an 18-year-old who played two years prior to school dropped out of school <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1017.142s">became</a>  homeless and then re-enrolled in Medford High School as a junior in February of 2019. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1022.704s">He</a>  was homeless living with a relative and began to recover his lost school credits. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1027.305s">This</a>  student is 18 and had only been in school in four years and only played two years of soccer. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1032.146s">This</a>  is nothing in the school's profile which would have raised a cause concerned about his eligibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1037.388s">There</a>  were many causes for concern in his profile as a student of color, homeless, undercredit, and had already dropped out to help support his family. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1045.79s">The</a>  student-athlete was, as we most likely see in urban districts, a successful re-engaged student. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1051.474s">We</a>  do this on a daily basis in our urban communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1054.656s">We</a>  as educational leaders seek to give our students every opportunity to succeed, despite the mainly deeply concerning challenges that our students battle, most of which is beyond their control. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1065.069s">The</a>  MIA is supposed to serve all students in all communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1067.831s">I've</a>  appealed to the MIA in the past as a principal and lead president for help. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1072.053s">We</a>  felt neglected and left out of our pleas, which were uniquely urban minority majority schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1078.037s">We've</a>  experienced biases and prejudices from the board members during our process. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1082.14s">Unfortunately,</a>  this incident involving this student athlete has the same familiar ring of injustice and bias. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1088.063s">The</a>  MIA has an opportunity to rectify the situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1091.188s">It</a>  is time for the MIA to reverse its decision and allow for the Medford High School student-athlete to play and let the Medford continue its season. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1097.938s">This</a>  time is now. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1099.219s">Make</a>  the situation right. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1101.162s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1101.503s">And</a>  that's from John Oteri, the superintendent of schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1104.523s">in</a>  Malden, so I would just like to take the community participation time to thank a lot of people, because it had been a very trying day, and I actually want to specifically thank the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1115.97s">There</a>  were times that I would even say that I was waffling at some point, because it just was getting to be a little bit overwhelming, basing on rules and things like that, but our mayor was very adamant of pushing for our students to play, and I think that should be recognized here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1130.999s">There's</a>  a lot of people, Dr. Peter Cushing, <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1133.62s">Athletic</a>  director Bobby Maloney Just a lot of people at the table just trying to figure out figure out and figure out So I just wanted to personally thank them in front of this committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=1143.563s">So</a>  thank you everybody.</p>
