1
00:06:37,488 --> 00:06:39,469
[SPEAKER_11]: To order, the secretary will call the rolls.

2
00:06:49,496 --> 00:06:51,057
[SPEAKER_17]: President, seven present, none absent.

3
00:06:51,157 --> 00:06:52,618
[SPEAKER_17]: All please rise and salute our flag.

4
00:06:53,378 --> 00:07:05,126
[SPEAKER_18]: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

5
00:07:05,827 --> 00:07:06,147
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

6
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:11,304
[SPEAKER_17]: Approval of the minutes of October 21st, 2019.

7
00:07:12,245 --> 00:07:13,467
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Russo.

8
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:21,635
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe it was actually held at Medford City Hall.

9
00:07:24,805 --> 00:07:25,405
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm trying to remember.

10
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:26,466
[SPEAKER_17]: It was here.

11
00:07:26,606 --> 00:07:27,527
[SPEAKER_17]: It was here, okay.

12
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:30,008
[SPEAKER_17]: Would you like to make a motion?

13
00:07:30,068 --> 00:07:31,109
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, motion to amend.

14
00:07:31,129 --> 00:07:32,030
[SPEAKER_17]: Approved with the amendment.

00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:32,650
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, thank you.

00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:34,331
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion for approval as amended.

17
00:07:34,391 --> 00:07:35,532
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there a second on the floor?

18
00:07:36,272 --> 00:07:36,873
[SPEAKER_17]: Second by Ms.

19
00:07:36,913 --> 00:07:37,273
[SPEAKER_17]: Kratz.

20
00:07:37,733 --> 00:07:38,494
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor?

21
00:07:38,794 --> 00:07:39,034
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

22
00:07:39,174 --> 00:07:39,935
[SPEAKER_17]: All those opposed?

23
00:07:41,075 --> 00:07:41,836
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes.

24
00:07:42,076 --> 00:07:44,077
[SPEAKER_17]: Approval of bills, transfer of funds.

25
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:47,440
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a motion to approve by Ms.

26
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,000
[SPEAKER_17]: Mustone.

27
00:07:54,005 --> 00:07:59,910
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't see the assistant superintendent here, so I'll waive them and email her directly.

28
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:00,731
[SPEAKER_17]: Very good.

29
00:08:00,971 --> 00:08:02,873
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a motion for approval by Miss Mustone.

30
00:08:02,913 --> 00:08:04,674
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there a second by Mr Russo?

31
00:08:05,054 --> 00:08:05,975
[SPEAKER_17]: Roll call vote, please.

32
00:08:08,638 --> 00:08:11,180
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

33
00:08:16,184 --> 00:08:18,005
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

34
00:08:18,046 --> 00:08:18,726
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes.

35
00:08:19,126 --> 00:08:20,027
[SPEAKER_17]: Report of secretary.

36
00:08:20,047 --> 00:08:20,127
[SPEAKER_17]: None.

37
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:22,555
[SPEAKER_17]: Report of committee.

38
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:25,858
[SPEAKER_17]: There is an agenda for the rules subcommittee meeting.

39
00:08:25,898 --> 00:08:26,099
[SPEAKER_17]: Ms.

40
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:26,939
[SPEAKER_17]: Kretz, chairperson.

41
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:33,086
[SPEAKER_24]: The rules subcommittee had a meeting this evening at 6.30 p.m.

42
00:08:33,726 --> 00:08:39,112
[SPEAKER_24]: and we met to vote and vote on the member public schools attendance policy.

43
00:08:40,493 --> 00:08:44,738
[SPEAKER_24]: What I can give everybody in their packets, everybody received over the weekend,

44
00:08:45,758 --> 00:08:47,019
[SPEAKER_24]: Some documents, three documents.

45
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:52,840
[SPEAKER_24]: The first document was the Medford Public Schools attendance policy that is currently on the MAS website.

46
00:08:53,481 --> 00:09:01,923
[SPEAKER_24]: The second document is the attendance policy that we received from the MASC, which is their updated policy dated February 2019.

47
00:09:02,503 --> 00:09:07,525
[SPEAKER_24]: We use this policy as a guideline when updating the Medford Public Schools attendance policy.

48
00:09:08,103 --> 00:09:14,907
[SPEAKER_24]: The MASE attendance policy is adopted by neighboring districts such as Seminole, Winchester, and several other districts.

49
00:09:15,828 --> 00:09:20,711
[SPEAKER_24]: The third document in your packet is the proposed updated member public schools policy.

50
00:09:21,131 --> 00:09:23,493
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm just going to summarize some of the updates that are in

51
00:09:24,863 --> 00:09:27,804
[SPEAKER_24]: the policy that's the last, the third document in your packet.

52
00:09:28,584 --> 00:09:51,350
[SPEAKER_24]: So the school committee had, I'm sorry, not the school committee, the subcommittee had a meeting earlier in, at the end of October, and we went with all the administrators, and we, after that meeting, Paul Russo got in touch with Jim Hardy at the MASC, and he asked the MASC if they could share their attendance policy with us.

53
00:09:51,894 --> 00:09:54,116
[SPEAKER_24]: So Paul got that document from Jim Hardy.

54
00:09:55,077 --> 00:09:57,219
[SPEAKER_24]: We made just a few changes.

55
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:05,408
[SPEAKER_24]: We added the word caregivers to all the paragraphs throughout the document wherever you see parents, guardians, wherever that's referenced you'll see caregivers as well.

56
00:10:05,968 --> 00:10:09,231
[SPEAKER_24]: We separated the section unexcused absence so it stands out.

57
00:10:09,772 --> 00:10:14,797
[SPEAKER_24]: Additionally the language was updated to show the new verbiage discussed in the subcommittee meeting on 10.1.

58
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:23,861
[SPEAKER_24]: stating the consequences for unexcused absences are limited to the same day restrictions on participation in extracurricular activities.

59
00:10:24,481 --> 00:10:29,405
[SPEAKER_24]: Lastly, a policy information section was added at the bottom left-hand corner of the document.

60
00:10:29,745 --> 00:10:32,589
[SPEAKER_24]: so we can track the version, date, and approved policy.

61
00:10:32,969 --> 00:10:38,276
[SPEAKER_24]: Going forward, this is something that will appear on all newly updated policies.

62
00:10:39,497 --> 00:10:47,967
[SPEAKER_24]: The document was reviewed by each principal at each school, as well as the superintendent, Dr. Edward Vincent, associate superintendent Peter Cushing,

63
00:10:49,809 --> 00:10:53,291
[SPEAKER_24]: Associate Superintendent Diane Caldwell, Headmaster DeLeva.

64
00:10:54,011 --> 00:11:01,275
[SPEAKER_24]: We shared this document with everybody, including all the original attendees at the October 1st meeting.

65
00:11:02,056 --> 00:11:10,220
[SPEAKER_24]: So they all received and reviewed the document electronically via Google Docs, and they made suggestions, comments, or updates as needed.

66
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:13,421
[SPEAKER_24]: So what you're looking at is the proposed

67
00:11:14,976 --> 00:11:17,598
[SPEAKER_24]: updated Medford Public Schools attendance policy.

68
00:11:18,198 --> 00:11:22,442
[SPEAKER_24]: At our subcommittee meeting this evening, there was just one minor update.

69
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:30,608
[SPEAKER_24]: So if you pull out the, I guess I numbered the pages, so it's the fourth page, I think, in your document.

70
00:11:30,888 --> 00:11:33,390
[SPEAKER_24]: So the last paragraph on the fourth page

71
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:50,814
[SPEAKER_24]: That last paragraph where it says each principal or designee will notify a student's parent, guardian, caregiver within three, we added the word school during our subcommittee meeting, school days of the student's absence in the event the parent, caregiver has not informed the school's absence.

72
00:11:51,254 --> 00:11:53,135
[SPEAKER_24]: So that was the one minor update.

73
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:59,516
[SPEAKER_24]: And the attendance policy was I motion to accept to move over to the regular committee tonight.

74
00:12:00,256 --> 00:12:02,177
[SPEAKER_24]: And Mr. Russo seconded.

75
00:12:04,497 --> 00:12:16,744
[SPEAKER_24]: At this time, I'd like to make a motion to approve this document so that we can get this posted on the Medford Public Schools website and then share with the MASC as our new updated policy.

76
00:12:17,087 --> 00:12:19,409
[SPEAKER_24]: so they can put the updated policy on their website.

77
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:22,652
[SPEAKER_17]: Chairperson Kretz, was there a vote in your subcommittee meeting?

78
00:12:22,792 --> 00:12:23,633
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, yes, there was, yes.

79
00:12:24,053 --> 00:12:25,815
[SPEAKER_24]: And I'm sorry, I didn't say that, yes.

80
00:12:25,835 --> 00:12:26,536
[SPEAKER_24]: That's okay.

81
00:12:26,556 --> 00:12:37,226
[SPEAKER_24]: So there was a vote, and there was none in the affirmative, I'm sorry, two in the affirmative, zero negative, and there was one absent.

82
00:12:37,646 --> 00:12:39,608
[SPEAKER_24]: So it was the motion passed.

83
00:12:40,101 --> 00:12:40,501
[SPEAKER_17]: Very good.

84
00:12:40,522 --> 00:12:41,282
[SPEAKER_24]: Nice job.

85
00:12:41,403 --> 00:12:41,763
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

86
00:12:42,484 --> 00:12:45,267
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a motion on the floor for acceptance of the policy as amended.

87
00:12:45,327 --> 00:12:46,148
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there a second?

88
00:12:46,689 --> 00:12:47,350
[SPEAKER_17]: Second by Ms.

89
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:47,950
[SPEAKER_17]: Vandekloot.

90
00:12:48,471 --> 00:12:49,272
[SPEAKER_17]: Roll call vote, please.

91
00:12:49,732 --> 00:12:50,714
[SPEAKER_17]: Unless there's a discussion.

92
00:12:50,734 --> 00:12:51,214
[SPEAKER_17]: Does anybody?

93
00:12:51,555 --> 00:12:52,536
[SPEAKER_17]: No one's blinking up here.

94
00:12:52,556 --> 00:12:53,457
[SPEAKER_17]: All good.

95
00:12:54,057 --> 00:12:54,738
[SPEAKER_17]: Roll call vote, please.

96
00:12:57,101 --> 00:13:11,598
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes seven in the affirmative zero in the negative motion passes rule is adopted Thank You chairperson and members of the committee did an outstanding job Okay, thank you

97
00:13:13,374 --> 00:13:18,220
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, at this time we'd like to announce we have two school committee persons elect in the audience.

98
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:20,583
[SPEAKER_17]: We have Jenny Graham and we have Melanie McLaughlin.

99
00:13:20,623 --> 00:13:24,528
[SPEAKER_17]: If you'd like to come into behind the rail and sit with us, please feel free to.

100
00:13:25,329 --> 00:13:28,373
[SPEAKER_17]: And we just want to congratulate you and wish you the luck in the next two years.

101
00:13:43,628 --> 00:13:43,968
[SPEAKER_16]: Welcome.

102
00:13:45,149 --> 00:13:45,409
[SPEAKER_24]: Welcome.

103
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:46,010
[SPEAKER_24]: Come on over.

104
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:48,572
[SPEAKER_17]: At this time, it is community participation.

105
00:13:48,652 --> 00:13:52,555
[SPEAKER_17]: I believe we have

106
00:14:13,493 --> 00:14:17,804
[SPEAKER_17]: the principal of Medford High School, Mr. DeLiva in the audience, who would like to address this body.

107
00:14:21,494 --> 00:14:22,497
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, let me put you on.

108
00:14:26,725 --> 00:14:27,506
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening, everyone.

109
00:14:28,126 --> 00:14:30,388
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I'm coming in on community participation.

110
00:14:31,148 --> 00:14:40,853
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to acknowledge a lot of people, as you guys know, the things that were going on this past weekend regarding our boys' soccer team.

111
00:14:40,954 --> 00:14:44,996
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was a lot of pieces that were involved to get where we got on Saturday.

112
00:14:46,457 --> 00:14:49,458
[SPEAKER_02]: I received two letters, and I just wanted to make it known.

113
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:54,181
[SPEAKER_02]: One by the Greater Boston League, as you know that we've reformed the Greater Boston League.

114
00:14:56,523 --> 00:15:02,568
[SPEAKER_02]: wrote a letter in support of the Medford High School boys soccer team, and if it's okay, I could just read the letter briefly.

115
00:15:03,789 --> 00:15:16,780
[SPEAKER_02]: MIA Board of Directors, I ask that you receive this letter as a show of support for the Medford High School and their efforts to provide their student-athletes with an equitable opportunity to participate in the Division I North Sectional Boys Soccer Final.

116
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:22,963
[SPEAKER_02]: To be blunt, the issue that occurred is one that urban schools deal with on a regular basis.

117
00:15:23,123 --> 00:15:28,867
[SPEAKER_02]: Far too often, we have students that arrive at our schools that have experienced trauma and the results of having to leave school.

118
00:15:29,548 --> 00:15:31,809
[SPEAKER_02]: One of our main goals is to recapture these students.

119
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:35,792
[SPEAKER_02]: In many cases, the trail of documentation is hard to navigate.

120
00:15:35,892 --> 00:15:39,935
[SPEAKER_02]: Some students have been to multiple schools in multiple cities, states, and countries.

121
00:15:40,616 --> 00:15:44,799
[SPEAKER_02]: They are age appropriate, credit appropriate, and fit easily into a specific grade.

122
00:15:45,439 --> 00:15:49,202
[SPEAKER_02]: We feel that this situation has drastically higher rate of occurrence in urban schools.

123
00:15:49,843 --> 00:15:56,349
[SPEAKER_02]: In this case, we feel that the circumstances that are related to the ineligible player are directly related to his life situation.

124
00:15:57,090 --> 00:16:05,197
[SPEAKER_02]: The principals and athletic directors of the Greater Boston League support Medford High School and their efforts that they are taking to rectify the situation.

125
00:16:05,677 --> 00:16:08,260
[SPEAKER_02]: We feel strongly that the decision should be overturned.

126
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:12,984
[SPEAKER_02]: and the team, as well as the players, should be allowed to participate in the boys' state soccer tournament.

127
00:16:13,524 --> 00:16:18,308
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for ensuring the efforts of our student-athletes receive an equitable opportunity to participate.

128
00:16:18,729 --> 00:16:23,733
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was from the Greater Boston League president, Chris Messerangelo, the principal of Malden High School.

129
00:16:24,433 --> 00:16:25,955
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wanted to also put that in record.

130
00:16:25,995 --> 00:16:35,603
[SPEAKER_02]: And we also received a letter from the superintendent of Malden as well, writing to the MIA regarding the situation, which, if it's okay, I could read that letter as well.

131
00:16:37,485 --> 00:16:46,813
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm writing as a school superintendent and former high school principal to urge you to reconsider the decision which was ruled that Medford High School soccer player ineligible.

132
00:16:47,354 --> 00:16:52,078
[SPEAKER_02]: This ruling is unfair and the timing tragically paralyzes the team and the player.

133
00:16:52,558 --> 00:16:56,682
[SPEAKER_02]: The student athlete, an 18-year-old who played two years prior to school dropped out of school

134
00:16:57,142 --> 00:17:02,123
[SPEAKER_02]: became homeless and then re-enrolled in Medford High School as a junior in February of 2019.

135
00:17:02,704 --> 00:17:06,785
[SPEAKER_02]: He was homeless living with a relative and began to recover his lost school credits.

136
00:17:07,305 --> 00:17:11,626
[SPEAKER_02]: This student is 18 and had only been in school in four years and only played two years of soccer.

137
00:17:12,146 --> 00:17:16,527
[SPEAKER_02]: This is nothing in the school's profile which would have raised a cause concerned about his eligibility.

138
00:17:17,388 --> 00:17:25,130
[SPEAKER_02]: There were many causes for concern in his profile as a student of color, homeless, undercredit, and had already dropped out to help support his family.

139
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:30,733
[SPEAKER_02]: The student-athlete was, as we most likely see in urban districts, a successful re-engaged student.

140
00:17:31,474 --> 00:17:34,155
[SPEAKER_02]: We do this on a daily basis in our urban communities.

141
00:17:34,656 --> 00:17:44,202
[SPEAKER_02]: We as educational leaders seek to give our students every opportunity to succeed, despite the mainly deeply concerning challenges that our students battle, most of which is beyond their control.

142
00:17:45,069 --> 00:17:47,811
[SPEAKER_02]: The MIA is supposed to serve all students in all communities.

143
00:17:47,831 --> 00:17:51,493
[SPEAKER_02]: I've appealed to the MIA in the past as a principal and lead president for help.

144
00:17:52,053 --> 00:17:57,857
[SPEAKER_02]: We felt neglected and left out of our pleas, which were uniquely urban minority majority schools.

145
00:17:58,037 --> 00:18:01,619
[SPEAKER_02]: We've experienced biases and prejudices from the board members during our process.

146
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:07,443
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, this incident involving this student athlete has the same familiar ring of injustice and bias.

147
00:18:08,063 --> 00:18:10,705
[SPEAKER_02]: The MIA has an opportunity to rectify the situation.

148
00:18:11,188 --> 00:18:17,897
[SPEAKER_02]: It is time for the MIA to reverse its decision and allow for the Medford High School student-athlete to play and let the Medford continue its season.

149
00:18:17,938 --> 00:18:18,759
[SPEAKER_02]: This time is now.

150
00:18:19,219 --> 00:18:21,022
[SPEAKER_02]: Make the situation right.

151
00:18:21,162 --> 00:18:21,483
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

152
00:18:21,503 --> 00:18:23,746
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's from John Oteri, the superintendent of schools.

153
00:18:24,523 --> 00:18:34,689
[SPEAKER_02]: in Malden, so I would just like to take the community participation time to thank a lot of people, because it had been a very trying day, and I actually want to specifically thank the mayor.

154
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:50,919
[SPEAKER_02]: There were times that I would even say that I was waffling at some point, because it just was getting to be a little bit overwhelming, basing on rules and things like that, but our mayor was very adamant of pushing for our students to play, and I think that should be recognized here tonight.

155
00:18:50,999 --> 00:18:52,760
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of people, Dr. Peter Cushing,

156
00:18:53,620 --> 00:19:03,523
[SPEAKER_02]: Athletic director Bobby Maloney Just a lot of people at the table just trying to figure out figure out and figure out So I just wanted to personally thank them in front of this committee.

157
00:19:03,563 --> 00:19:04,584
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you everybody.

158
00:19:05,084 --> 00:19:18,608
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much Writers of those letters from the school committee members thanking them for weighing in on behalf of our students I

159
00:19:20,072 --> 00:19:25,497
[SPEAKER_17]: Also, if I could, the mayor of Cambridge was involved in this, the mayor of Somerville took an active interest in this.

160
00:19:26,057 --> 00:19:36,045
[SPEAKER_17]: We reached out to a lot of different entities over the course of Thursday afternoon when we got the original ruling, and Friday evening when they did their second re-look at the rules.

161
00:19:36,266 --> 00:19:39,268
[SPEAKER_17]: And, you know, rules are great, but sometimes they don't fit.

162
00:19:39,408 --> 00:19:41,030
[SPEAKER_17]: Everybody doesn't fit into that box.

163
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:46,194
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's when you expect a board of their caliber to make those kinds of decisions.

164
00:19:46,842 --> 00:19:50,385
[SPEAKER_17]: that everyone can live with and not an unfair, unjust decision.

165
00:19:50,425 --> 00:19:54,007
[SPEAKER_17]: And what they did is they just corroborated, collaborated together.

166
00:19:54,047 --> 00:19:56,069
[SPEAKER_17]: And we heard it on the phone when we were on the phone with them.

167
00:19:56,809 --> 00:20:01,953
[SPEAKER_17]: And I must say, I felt so terrible listening to the conversations that were on the other end of that line.

168
00:20:02,513 --> 00:20:05,455
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm appalled at the MIAA once again.

169
00:20:05,796 --> 00:20:06,816
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not the first time.

170
00:20:06,836 --> 00:20:08,217
[SPEAKER_17]: It probably won't be the last time.

171
00:20:08,598 --> 00:20:14,702
[SPEAKER_17]: But I'm appalled once again at their actions and their ability to not look past black and white on a piece of paper.

172
00:20:16,316 --> 00:20:17,577
[SPEAKER_17]: But we fought.

173
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:18,577
[SPEAKER_17]: We fought for you kids.

174
00:20:18,637 --> 00:20:19,518
[SPEAKER_17]: I want you to know that.

175
00:20:19,558 --> 00:20:20,299
[SPEAKER_17]: We weren't giving up.

176
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:26,243
[SPEAKER_17]: We fought the whole time and we said they deserve their day to win or lose on the field because that's the right thing.

177
00:20:27,304 --> 00:20:36,351
[SPEAKER_17]: We put everything behind and we said we're just pushing ahead and we're going to the courts because if MIA can't make the right decision, we're going to go to an unbiased individual to do it.

178
00:20:36,771 --> 00:20:37,612
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what we did.

179
00:20:37,692 --> 00:20:42,175
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank goodness there was a judge that stayed around past closing time on Friday.

180
00:20:42,195 --> 00:20:43,376
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to thank the clerk of courts.

181
00:20:43,776 --> 00:20:55,739
[SPEAKER_17]: for keeping the courtroom open because MIA got us off the phone at 4.35 when the courts closed at 4.30, didn't make a decision, didn't inform us, made a decision, leaked it to the Herald, won.

182
00:20:56,660 --> 00:21:00,721
[SPEAKER_17]: And the clerks that stayed there as well as the judge that stayed there.

183
00:21:01,001 --> 00:21:05,402
[SPEAKER_17]: And so thank them all for doing their job on Friday evening.

184
00:21:06,455 --> 00:21:08,156
[SPEAKER_17]: As you can tell, I'm still heated about it.

185
00:21:08,176 --> 00:21:09,576
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sorry.

186
00:21:10,297 --> 00:21:12,718
[SPEAKER_02]: But it couldn't have been done if it wasn't a team effort.

187
00:21:12,878 --> 00:21:20,581
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just wanted to acknowledge the people that really came in and really did their best to, you know, there's a lot of people in a room sometimes.

188
00:21:20,601 --> 00:21:21,421
[SPEAKER_17]: They did what was right.

189
00:21:21,661 --> 00:21:21,861
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

190
00:21:22,081 --> 00:21:26,183
[SPEAKER_02]: And the driving force had been, it was always about the students.

191
00:21:26,263 --> 00:21:29,084
[SPEAKER_02]: No matter what, that's what the rule was or whatever it was.

192
00:21:29,684 --> 00:21:30,765
[SPEAKER_02]: It was always about the students.

193
00:21:30,825 --> 00:21:32,266
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was the main thing.

194
00:21:32,306 --> 00:21:35,807
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, I really have to thank the mayor because there were times we were like,

195
00:21:36,763 --> 00:21:37,643
[SPEAKER_02]: What are we going to do here?

196
00:21:38,364 --> 00:21:41,064
[SPEAKER_02]: And the superintendent, of course, as well, I'm sorry.

197
00:21:41,084 --> 00:21:42,885
[SPEAKER_17]: And regardless of the outcome, they're winners.

198
00:21:43,045 --> 00:21:43,505
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, exactly.

199
00:21:43,525 --> 00:21:45,006
[SPEAKER_02]: They are winners in our book.

200
00:21:45,026 --> 00:21:45,326
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

201
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:46,806
[SPEAKER_02]: So who goes to the boys' volleyball team?

202
00:21:46,826 --> 00:21:47,327
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, everyone.

203
00:21:48,187 --> 00:21:49,887
Thank you.

204
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:51,528
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

205
00:21:55,388 --> 00:21:57,410
[SPEAKER_17]: Item one, superintendent's update and comments.

206
00:21:59,631 --> 00:22:10,459
[SPEAKER_25]: So I, too, was going to take a little bit of time to talk about our boys' soccer, because that was kind of top of mind for the past few days.

207
00:22:11,299 --> 00:22:18,685
[SPEAKER_25]: And I want to just share some of my reflections and thoughts with you and tell you what's happening in the wonderful Medford Public Schools.

208
00:22:19,882 --> 00:22:29,405
[SPEAKER_25]: So as you heard from Headmaster DeLeva, the wonderful letters of support that we received, these are a few reflections.

209
00:22:30,966 --> 00:22:43,890
[SPEAKER_25]: So a tremendous team that this community was happy to support for their great athletic achievements, but also for the upstanding way they carried themselves all year.

210
00:22:45,251 --> 00:22:47,872
[SPEAKER_25]: We talk a lot about the importance of the Mustang Way,

211
00:22:49,598 --> 00:22:53,741
[SPEAKER_25]: while these players exemplified it every time they took the field.

212
00:22:55,062 --> 00:22:56,242
[SPEAKER_25]: They never dropped the ball.

213
00:22:57,463 --> 00:22:59,004
[SPEAKER_25]: We did as the adults.

214
00:23:00,005 --> 00:23:07,310
[SPEAKER_25]: So I truly felt that they should not have to pay the price for a no malice clerical error on our part.

215
00:23:08,711 --> 00:23:14,295
[SPEAKER_25]: Despite working for two long days pleading our case to both the MIAA

216
00:23:15,264 --> 00:23:20,607
[SPEAKER_25]: and the MIAC, they denied our Mustangs the opportunity to play.

217
00:23:22,308 --> 00:23:36,675
[SPEAKER_25]: Mayor Burke, Athletic Director Bobby Maloney, Headmaster DeLeva, and many members of my team, we felt that this was an unfair decision for our students and took the MIAA to court to fight.

218
00:23:38,596 --> 00:23:39,997
[SPEAKER_25]: It was the right thing to do.

219
00:23:41,955 --> 00:23:46,398
[SPEAKER_25]: The court found in Medford's favor and the game was played on Saturday night.

220
00:23:48,639 --> 00:23:52,101
[SPEAKER_25]: A very evenly matched game, if I say so myself.

221
00:23:53,401 --> 00:23:56,083
[SPEAKER_25]: The Mustangs left it all on the field.

222
00:23:57,244 --> 00:24:00,085
[SPEAKER_25]: I also say hats off to Lincoln Sudbury.

223
00:24:02,447 --> 00:24:08,210
[SPEAKER_25]: They were not victorious, our Mustangs, but they were victorious in our hearts for never giving up.

224
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:15,426
[SPEAKER_25]: Mustang Country made up three quarters of the crowd, and Medford represented strongly.

225
00:24:16,768 --> 00:24:21,252
[SPEAKER_25]: I felt like I was at a World Cup event, although I wasn't Lynn.

226
00:24:22,734 --> 00:24:24,315
[SPEAKER_25]: The atmosphere was electric.

227
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:31,103
[SPEAKER_25]: Mustang Country chanted and cheered throughout the whole match.

228
00:24:33,373 --> 00:24:40,875
[SPEAKER_25]: The MIAA stated that they felt badly that a clerical error had brought them to this decision, but that rules were made to be followed.

229
00:24:42,696 --> 00:24:43,376
[SPEAKER_25]: I do agree.

230
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:51,319
[SPEAKER_25]: However, sometimes before a rule is applied, extenuating circumstances should be taken into account.

231
00:24:52,859 --> 00:25:01,342
[SPEAKER_25]: In this case, I wonder if Medford's team was afforded fair consideration for all of the circumstances we presented.

232
00:25:03,278 --> 00:25:14,807
[SPEAKER_25]: Sometimes the answer to every question may not be a yes or a no, but instead it might be maybe, or let's look more completely into this issue.

233
00:25:16,088 --> 00:25:23,454
[SPEAKER_25]: At times we might ask to relook at an issue so that every individual feels that their predicament was heard.

234
00:25:24,755 --> 00:25:26,356
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, what I can say this evening,

235
00:25:26,944 --> 00:25:47,247
[SPEAKER_25]: We are so truly, truly appreciative of all the support Medford received from Mayor Burke, from the School Committee, from the City Council, the GBL League, Somerville Mayor Joe Curtatone, Cambridge Mayor, Malden Public Schools Superintendent John Oteri,

236
00:25:48,352 --> 00:25:51,614
[SPEAKER_25]: whose letter was read to you just a moment ago by Headmaster DeLeva.

237
00:25:52,254 --> 00:26:02,661
[SPEAKER_25]: I want you to know Superintendent John O'Teary stood by my side and Dr. Peter Cushing the whole entire game, cheering on Medford Mustangs.

238
00:26:06,003 --> 00:26:17,270
[SPEAKER_25]: I want to thank the 5,786 people and counting, family, friends, neighbors, and supporters of the Mustang boys soccer team who signed the change.org

239
00:26:18,483 --> 00:26:20,984
[SPEAKER_25]: on petition for them to be able to play.

240
00:26:22,165 --> 00:26:27,207
[SPEAKER_25]: The entire community was Medford strong and rallied behind our students.

241
00:26:28,667 --> 00:26:43,534
[SPEAKER_25]: Lastly, we must thank our school committee attorney, Howard Greenspan, and our attorney who fought the MIAA for the students to be able to play, attorney John J. Jack McGlynn, Jr., and his law firm of McGlynn & McGlynn.

242
00:26:44,873 --> 00:26:55,025
[SPEAKER_25]: Attorney McGlynn represented us strongly and successfully, and so I'm so grateful that we were able to play on Saturday and give it our best shot.

243
00:26:56,286 --> 00:26:59,169
[SPEAKER_25]: So I just wanted to share those remarks with you regarding

244
00:27:00,028 --> 00:27:03,389
[SPEAKER_25]: our soccer extravaganza the past few days.

245
00:27:04,229 --> 00:27:16,013
[SPEAKER_25]: But as I transition from that, I wanna just let you know or share with you what else is happening in Medford, and there's a lot happening in Medford, so I wanna just try to go through these other updates so you're just aware.

246
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:21,915
[SPEAKER_25]: First thing, this coming Thursday, there's a very important traffic notice.

247
00:27:23,395 --> 00:27:26,056
[SPEAKER_25]: Eversource is closing South Street.

248
00:27:26,973 --> 00:27:30,696
[SPEAKER_25]: And this impacts us and it impacts our school buses.

249
00:27:31,457 --> 00:27:38,823
[SPEAKER_25]: So everyone needs to know school bus route 13 and route 12, Maple Street at South Street.

250
00:27:40,244 --> 00:27:42,827
[SPEAKER_25]: Students will not be able to use that stop anymore.

251
00:27:43,247 --> 00:27:48,852
[SPEAKER_25]: Students are going to walk down to Winthrop at South Street near Goldilocks Bagels.

252
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,641
[SPEAKER_25]: to board the bus in the morning.

253
00:27:52,421 --> 00:28:00,685
[SPEAKER_25]: And in the afternoon, they'll be dropped off at that same spot, Winthrop Street at South Street, very close to the Goldilocks Bagels.

254
00:28:03,768 --> 00:28:11,174
[SPEAKER_25]: Another route, any other route using Winthrop Street will have to use Route 16 to get to the middle and elementary schools.

255
00:28:11,594 --> 00:28:28,667
[SPEAKER_25]: So as you know, Route 16 has a lot of congestion, so it's going to be a longer commute, and we'll have to figure out the times, but I just want to, you know, prepare everyone in advance that the street is closing, so we have to be prepared for that.

256
00:28:31,576 --> 00:28:34,919
[SPEAKER_25]: On the high school level, we have had a few technology glitches.

257
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:40,545
[SPEAKER_25]: We got a few emails and some questions about what's happening with technology.

258
00:28:41,045 --> 00:28:46,691
[SPEAKER_25]: So we are actively working on fixing our technology at the high school in particular.

259
00:28:47,691 --> 00:28:50,932
[SPEAKER_25]: The system, there are multiple systems going on to the device.

260
00:28:51,452 --> 00:28:58,374
[SPEAKER_25]: Everyone is traveling with a mobile device and all of those devices logging on to our one system.

261
00:28:58,974 --> 00:29:01,835
[SPEAKER_25]: It's also sometimes overwhelming our system.

262
00:29:01,875 --> 00:29:04,015
[SPEAKER_25]: So we are working on a fix for that.

263
00:29:04,095 --> 00:29:13,638
[SPEAKER_25]: So I just want you to know we are aware and we are working and meeting collaboratively to come up with solutions to help our technology challenges at the high school.

264
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:17,782
[SPEAKER_25]: Transitioning again, middle school winter sports.

265
00:29:18,182 --> 00:29:27,470
[SPEAKER_25]: Just so you know, those of us who love our athletic events, after a very competitive fall season, middle school sports, winter season is starting.

266
00:29:28,031 --> 00:29:36,178
[SPEAKER_25]: Boys and girls basketball tryouts were held last week, and they're going to begin their season the week of December 9th.

267
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:39,481
[SPEAKER_25]: Also, last week,

268
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:48,323
[SPEAKER_25]: Medford CPAC group and the Medford Family Network co-hosted a presentation supporting students with food allergies in schools.

269
00:29:49,623 --> 00:29:54,746
[SPEAKER_25]: I was pleased to attend this important informational session at the Andrews Middle School.

270
00:29:55,227 --> 00:30:13,679
[SPEAKER_25]: Over 50 people were in attendance to hear Dr. Michael Kistner of Massachusetts General Hospital for Children and Dr. Jennifer Labovodich of Boston Children's Hospital, who discussed strategies so all of us are aware of student allergy issues.

271
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:22,603
[SPEAKER_25]: The doctors also stressed the need for supportive classroom environments and having strong emergency care plans in place.

272
00:30:23,284 --> 00:30:28,987
[SPEAKER_25]: For those who are interested but may have missed the presentation, it is available on the school blog.

273
00:30:29,707 --> 00:30:40,473
[SPEAKER_25]: And I'd like to recognize assistant superintendent Dr. Cushing and school committee members Vander Kloot and Kretz were also in attendance at that presentation last week.

274
00:30:41,717 --> 00:30:44,398
[SPEAKER_25]: Also, we had Jumpstart Read for the Record.

275
00:30:44,958 --> 00:30:47,259
[SPEAKER_25]: That was held last week at the Columbus School.

276
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:51,061
[SPEAKER_25]: The book that everyone read was Thank You, Omu.

277
00:30:51,721 --> 00:30:57,244
[SPEAKER_25]: This year, Jumpstart celebrated its 14th anniversary of Read for the Record.

278
00:30:58,024 --> 00:31:18,773
[SPEAKER_25]: I know Dr. Kathy Kaye was very appreciative that Associate Superintendent Diane Caldwell, Assistant Superintendent of Finance Christine Patterson, McGlynn Middle School Principal Nick Tucci, and Director of English Language Arts and Humanity Dr. Nicole Chiesa, Director of Medford Family Network Marie Cassidy,

279
00:31:19,193 --> 00:31:24,998
[SPEAKER_25]: and school committee members Kathy Krutz and Mia Mastone participated in reading the books to students.

280
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:33,626
[SPEAKER_25]: Jumpstart's Read for the Record campaign highlights the importance of building literacy and language skills for every child.

281
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:38,492
[SPEAKER_25]: We have good news again in Mustang country.

282
00:31:39,252 --> 00:31:47,416
[SPEAKER_25]: A new graduate, a student who just graduated in June 2019, my first official graduating class.

283
00:31:48,136 --> 00:31:53,119
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, this freshman is already making a tremendous, tremendous mark in the world.

284
00:31:53,779 --> 00:31:59,302
[SPEAKER_25]: His name is Connor McFarlane, a 2019 high school graduate.

285
00:31:59,762 --> 00:32:01,143
[SPEAKER_25]: He won first place

286
00:32:02,095 --> 00:32:08,041
[SPEAKER_25]: first place in the University of Massachusetts at Amherst Innovation Challenge.

287
00:32:08,982 --> 00:32:16,250
[SPEAKER_25]: Connor, a chemical engineering student, developed the improved insulin delivery.

288
00:32:17,231 --> 00:32:18,212
[SPEAKER_25]: It's called an IID.

289
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:39,254
[SPEAKER_25]: An IID is an improved insulin delivery system for all insulin dependent diabetics that reduces pain, plastic waste, the amount of supplies needed to carry, and the amount of time spent managing the disease, allowing for more freedom for the patient.

290
00:32:39,995 --> 00:32:44,078
[SPEAKER_25]: His project was awarded first place and audience choice

291
00:32:44,625 --> 00:32:45,405
[SPEAKER_25]: for a prize of $1,250.

292
00:32:45,966 --> 00:32:50,508
[SPEAKER_25]: I just want to say congratulations, Connor.

293
00:32:51,028 --> 00:32:54,609
[SPEAKER_25]: We Mustangs are so proud of you.

294
00:33:01,292 --> 00:33:07,915
[SPEAKER_25]: We also had a groundbreaking or a partial groundbreaking held for our new cosmetology salon.

295
00:33:08,683 --> 00:33:10,724
[SPEAKER_25]: at the Medford Vocational Technical High School.

296
00:33:11,384 --> 00:33:32,535
[SPEAKER_25]: Last year, in a coordinated effort between the Medford School Committee member, Mia Mastone, City Solicitor, Mark Rumley, and Vocational Principal, Chad Fallon, Medford alumnus, Charles Hoff, explored the opportunity to donate a gift to the school in memory of his mother.

297
00:33:33,964 --> 00:33:49,456
[SPEAKER_25]: Principal Fallon shared with Mr. Hoff his vision to relocate the cosmetology program, which is currently located in the lower level of the school and not necessarily really accessible for everyone to the main level of the vocational school.

298
00:33:50,517 --> 00:33:56,602
[SPEAKER_25]: We feel that it will allow a more direct access point and ample parking for

299
00:33:57,052 --> 00:34:05,699
[SPEAKER_25]: clients, as well as people who would like to visit the salon, visit our bistro, our restaurant, and our automotive technology program.

300
00:34:06,239 --> 00:34:15,667
[SPEAKER_25]: So that project, you'll hear about it again later today, but the hope is that it will be completed in the spring of 2020, around May.

301
00:34:16,027 --> 00:34:17,448
[SPEAKER_25]: So we're excited about that.

302
00:34:17,549 --> 00:34:20,691
[SPEAKER_25]: And there will be a formal ribbon cutting in May of 2020.

303
00:34:22,973 --> 00:34:24,974
[SPEAKER_25]: Sandy Hook Promise presentation.

304
00:34:26,142 --> 00:34:42,009
[SPEAKER_25]: The Medford Public Schools partnered with Sandy Hook Promise through a grant funded by the Attorney General's office to provide mental health training, suicide prevention, and school-based violence prevention programs to keep our students safe.

305
00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:50,373
[SPEAKER_25]: The presentation, Start with Hello, was held last week at both the Andrews and McGlynn Middle Schools as well as the high school.

306
00:34:51,657 --> 00:35:14,684
[SPEAKER_25]: The Attorney General's Office and Sandy Hook Promise will collaborate with the Medford Public Schools to train educators and students over the course of the next two years in the three Know the Signs programs, which will teach youth and adults how to identify, assess, and intervene before a young person hurts themselves or others.

307
00:35:15,385 --> 00:35:19,426
[SPEAKER_25]: Special thanks to Stacey Shulman for applying for this important grant.

308
00:35:21,008 --> 00:35:25,711
[SPEAKER_25]: And as I come to an end, very close, I wanna recognize our fine arts department.

309
00:35:26,151 --> 00:35:27,992
[SPEAKER_25]: Those of you who love the arts, we all do.

310
00:35:28,372 --> 00:35:31,174
[SPEAKER_25]: They have announced their winter concert schedule.

311
00:35:31,954 --> 00:35:34,456
[SPEAKER_25]: Everything will be taking place at the high school.

312
00:35:35,096 --> 00:35:36,237
[SPEAKER_25]: Everyone is invited.

313
00:35:36,857 --> 00:35:42,781
[SPEAKER_25]: December 4th, high school chorus, senior string ensemble, and Robert's Hand Chimes.

314
00:35:43,361 --> 00:35:45,903
[SPEAKER_25]: December 5th, high school orchestra.

315
00:35:46,403 --> 00:35:49,065
[SPEAKER_25]: December 12th, middle school strings.

316
00:35:49,905 --> 00:35:51,666
[SPEAKER_25]: That one says at the McGlynn School.

317
00:35:52,107 --> 00:36:03,295
[SPEAKER_25]: January 21st, grade five strings, Troublemakers chorus and Roberts hand chimes, and January 22nd, high school band and middle school band.

318
00:36:03,595 --> 00:36:12,322
[SPEAKER_25]: We'll continue to give reminders, but just for people to know, Winter Fine Arts Department has the winter concert schedule available.

319
00:36:13,002 --> 00:36:30,659
[SPEAKER_25]: Also, our high school band will be selling Christmas trees and reefs in the high school parking lot as a fundraiser to help prepare for our trip 2020 to Pearl Harbor, which is going to be a very costly trip for our band to go all the way to Hawaii.

320
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:37,646
[SPEAKER_25]: So please, that is going to start the weekend of November 29th, right after Thanksgiving weekend, so I do hope

321
00:36:38,127 --> 00:36:40,047
[SPEAKER_25]: that you are able to support that.

322
00:36:41,548 --> 00:36:47,809
[SPEAKER_25]: Lastly, our Medford Family Network is hosting a coat drive throughout this entire month.

323
00:36:48,409 --> 00:36:59,011
[SPEAKER_25]: Please, if anyone has gently worn clothing, coats or jackets that they wanna donate to the Medford Family Network, please bring it to the high school.

324
00:36:59,411 --> 00:37:01,512
[SPEAKER_25]: Your donations would be greatly appreciated.

325
00:37:01,912 --> 00:37:05,753
[SPEAKER_25]: I thank you for listening, and I wish you all an early, happy Thanksgiving.

326
00:37:06,033 --> 00:37:06,413
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

327
00:37:07,633 --> 00:37:10,579
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr.. Russo Thank you for that report.

328
00:37:10,879 --> 00:37:18,473
[SPEAKER_06]: I just had a quick Question about two questions one the South Street closure Do we have a how long that's gonna last?

329
00:37:20,625 --> 00:37:23,826
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't have the official timetable.

330
00:37:25,307 --> 00:37:33,670
[SPEAKER_25]: I do know that it's closing officially on the 21st, and we will definitely be in close communication with Eversource.

331
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:40,813
[SPEAKER_25]: Again, sometimes when they dig or whatever they do, they find other challenges.

332
00:37:40,833 --> 00:37:42,633
[SPEAKER_25]: Like on Winthrop Street.

333
00:37:43,554 --> 00:37:46,595
[SPEAKER_25]: But we definitely have been communicating.

334
00:37:46,675 --> 00:37:49,876
[SPEAKER_25]: We've been in early communication with the bus company.

335
00:37:50,527 --> 00:37:55,182
[SPEAKER_25]: and just wanting to let people know that this is happening and there will be additional

336
00:37:59,155 --> 00:37:59,976
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's not a week.

337
00:38:00,116 --> 00:38:04,677
[SPEAKER_17]: We can get an estimate of the timeline and email everyone and get it out to your groups.

338
00:38:04,957 --> 00:38:05,277
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

339
00:38:05,537 --> 00:38:10,279
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I just wanted for clarification, since I know this, but I just wanted to make sure everybody else did.

340
00:38:10,539 --> 00:38:14,501
[SPEAKER_06]: When you were talking about the technology at the high school, you were specifically talking about the internet connections.

341
00:38:15,641 --> 00:38:16,301
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly, yes.

342
00:38:16,321 --> 00:38:18,802
[SPEAKER_06]: You didn't mention the word internet, and I just wanted to make sure that got included.

343
00:38:18,822 --> 00:38:19,242
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, yes, yes.

344
00:38:19,302 --> 00:38:24,084
[SPEAKER_25]: It was about the internet connections where our system's been crashing.

345
00:38:25,564 --> 00:38:37,248
[SPEAKER_25]: So we've been working on that, we've been meeting and we have some, we'll be able to present out on that sometime next month to give you a more robust update on what's happening with technology.

346
00:38:37,288 --> 00:38:42,470
[SPEAKER_25]: But just to let everyone know that we are definitely aware of the Internet challenges.

347
00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:43,090
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

348
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:43,730
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

349
00:38:44,794 --> 00:38:44,994
[SPEAKER_16]: Ms.

350
00:38:45,014 --> 00:38:45,634
[SPEAKER_16]: DiBenedetto.

351
00:38:46,014 --> 00:38:46,415
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

352
00:38:47,035 --> 00:38:52,236
[SPEAKER_16]: To follow up about South Street, can we make sure that an auto call is sent?

353
00:38:52,696 --> 00:39:00,459
[SPEAKER_16]: So especially with how cold it's been, we don't want to accidentally have any children waiting out there for the bus.

354
00:39:00,799 --> 00:39:02,239
[SPEAKER_16]: We can definitely do that.

355
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:13,603
[SPEAKER_16]: And just maybe to everyone, because kids might take a bus home to that area to walk to a grandparent's or a caregiver's

356
00:39:14,859 --> 00:39:19,949
[SPEAKER_16]: House, not just the kids that necessarily are living right in that area.

357
00:39:20,009 --> 00:39:24,217
[SPEAKER_25]: And we can definitely, if it's not already up on the blog, we'll definitely get it up as well.

358
00:39:24,377 --> 00:39:26,742
[SPEAKER_17]: And the Catholic schools that we service.

359
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:28,730
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

360
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:29,351
[SPEAKER_16]: Definitely.

361
00:39:29,531 --> 00:39:50,525
[SPEAKER_16]: And just, I don't know if we're gonna discuss it now, but there has been some emails and letters of concerns of bus crowding, but we can wait till further in this meeting, but especially middle school buses being overcrowded at the end of the day, going home now that some clubs have ended.

362
00:39:51,226 --> 00:39:54,808
[SPEAKER_16]: So I don't know if you could look into that and get us an update.

363
00:39:54,968 --> 00:39:55,729
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes, I can do that.

364
00:39:56,049 --> 00:39:56,429
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

365
00:39:56,709 --> 00:39:56,989
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

366
00:39:57,250 --> 00:39:57,570
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

367
00:39:59,047 --> 00:40:01,849
[SPEAKER_17]: Item number two, report on CCSR.

368
00:40:02,069 --> 00:40:03,950
[SPEAKER_17]: Michael Skorka and Mr. Richard Trotta.

369
00:40:12,395 --> 00:40:13,155
[SPEAKER_27]: Excuse me, hello.

370
00:40:13,175 --> 00:40:13,776
[SPEAKER_27]: Hello.

371
00:40:13,816 --> 00:40:14,456
[SPEAKER_27]: Richard Trotta.

372
00:40:15,917 --> 00:40:18,679
[SPEAKER_27]: Welcome back to school committee.

373
00:40:19,099 --> 00:40:24,022
[SPEAKER_27]: And I'm gonna say happy Thanksgiving to the school committee, the new school committee before I forget that.

374
00:40:24,662 --> 00:40:26,023
[SPEAKER_27]: And welcome to the new members.

375
00:40:27,354 --> 00:40:30,318
[SPEAKER_27]: We did our annual report a while ago.

376
00:40:30,358 --> 00:40:31,900
[SPEAKER_27]: We passed them out this week.

377
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,002
[SPEAKER_27]: It's 100 pages long, so I only read 25 pages.

378
00:40:40,727 --> 00:40:45,229
[SPEAKER_27]: And the new members, we'll get those to you so you can see what the report says.

379
00:40:45,769 --> 00:40:59,634
[SPEAKER_27]: So, what's gonna happen, I'm gonna give a brief comment about the overview and then Michael will talk about the students and their projects and then we'll be all done and take questions also.

380
00:41:00,794 --> 00:41:01,915
[SPEAKER_27]: So, first of all,

381
00:41:03,338 --> 00:41:09,321
[SPEAKER_27]: Michael and I want to thank the school committee and central office for continuing to report the support that you've given us over the years.

382
00:41:10,942 --> 00:41:15,985
[SPEAKER_27]: We wouldn't be able to do this without your help and so we thank you and look forward to continuing.

383
00:41:17,406 --> 00:41:20,068
[SPEAKER_27]: Today I got an interesting email from Cummings Foundation.

384
00:41:20,788 --> 00:41:25,911
[SPEAKER_27]: We applied for a sustaining grant for 10 years of $250,000 approximately.

385
00:41:26,832 --> 00:41:28,753
[SPEAKER_27]: We didn't get it yet, but we passed the first step.

386
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:30,774
[SPEAKER_27]: We're in the finalists for that grant.

387
00:41:32,384 --> 00:41:37,057
[SPEAKER_27]: So we won't know until spring, but hopefully before budget.

388
00:41:40,423 --> 00:41:43,366
[SPEAKER_27]: So this concept began a long time ago with Roy Bellison.

389
00:41:43,406 --> 00:41:55,336
[SPEAKER_27]: Basically, the program is a way of including social-emotional learning and leadership in the schools after school, because it doesn't interfere with the school day.

390
00:41:56,337 --> 00:42:00,280
[SPEAKER_27]: The drawback, of course, we don't get every student, but we still have quite a few students.

391
00:42:01,041 --> 00:42:03,804
[SPEAKER_27]: In fact, this year, up to over 500 students, K through 12.

392
00:42:06,073 --> 00:42:11,957
[SPEAKER_27]: It began in 2015 and 16, and I did it the first year alone, and I did some odds and ends.

393
00:42:11,977 --> 00:42:19,222
[SPEAKER_27]: I didn't have a lot of money left from the Bloomberg grant, and so it was just a number of activities that weren't really that powerful.

394
00:42:20,082 --> 00:42:27,367
[SPEAKER_27]: But the next year, we got the Cummings Foundation grant, and also at the same time, I met this gentleman named Michael Skorka, who's sitting next to me.

395
00:42:29,181 --> 00:42:32,703
[SPEAKER_27]: He was the key to getting the students dramatically involved in the program.

396
00:42:34,004 --> 00:42:39,667
[SPEAKER_27]: We started with 18 students at the high school, and now we have 150 this year.

397
00:42:39,867 --> 00:42:44,709
[SPEAKER_27]: So that was in three years, we've gone from 18 to 150 students at the high school.

398
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:46,470
[SPEAKER_27]: And district-wide, we went from 18 students to 500.

399
00:42:47,311 --> 00:42:50,412
[SPEAKER_27]: So it's been a dramatic increase in participation.

400
00:42:52,834 --> 00:42:55,295
[SPEAKER_27]: Now, let me go on my notes.

401
00:42:58,163 --> 00:43:01,705
[SPEAKER_27]: So, in essence, I'm going to state the mission in very simple terms.

402
00:43:01,886 --> 00:43:06,488
[SPEAKER_27]: It's to develop student leaders who work to make the community and the world a better place to live.

403
00:43:08,088 --> 00:43:27,106
[SPEAKER_27]: I want to make a note, too, that the students do a lot of work to help other people, but the person who gains the most, I really believe, are the students doing the projects, because they become leaders, and you'll see that when they speak, and you also, if you've been to any of our project fairs or events, you'll see the students take a lead, and they complete these projects.

404
00:43:27,566 --> 00:43:30,809
[SPEAKER_27]: The projects are year-long, so it's not just a small project.

405
00:43:30,869 --> 00:43:32,071
[SPEAKER_27]: It's pretty complex sometimes.

406
00:43:32,711 --> 00:43:33,852
[SPEAKER_27]: Sometimes they have to raise money.

407
00:43:34,272 --> 00:43:36,994
[SPEAKER_27]: Sometimes they have to go to the city council or school committee.

408
00:43:37,014 --> 00:43:42,558
[SPEAKER_27]: Sometimes they have to plan out with parents and community and do projects with non-profits.

409
00:43:43,679 --> 00:43:44,399
[SPEAKER_27]: And they raise money.

410
00:43:44,459 --> 00:43:49,283
[SPEAKER_27]: Some students have raised as much as $4,000 last year for the monument to the enslaved people.

411
00:43:50,944 --> 00:43:51,945
[SPEAKER_27]: The most important activity

412
00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:56,992
[SPEAKER_27]: that we believe that's critical is the student work.

413
00:43:57,073 --> 00:43:57,893
[SPEAKER_27]: We have other things we do.

414
00:43:57,913 --> 00:43:58,494
[SPEAKER_27]: We have speakers.

415
00:43:58,534 --> 00:44:02,677
[SPEAKER_27]: We had the poet laureate, Richard Blanco, a few weeks ago.

416
00:44:03,238 --> 00:44:09,383
[SPEAKER_27]: This past week we had Amanda Gorman, who's the youth poet laureate for the country.

417
00:44:10,264 --> 00:44:13,366
[SPEAKER_27]: We've had some speakers come into the schools, like the McGlynn in the high school.

418
00:44:14,267 --> 00:44:15,528
[SPEAKER_27]: We've done some professional development.

419
00:44:15,568 --> 00:44:16,869
[SPEAKER_27]: We've had some mini grants.

420
00:44:16,909 --> 00:44:17,730
[SPEAKER_27]: We've had resources.

421
00:44:18,110 --> 00:44:21,413
[SPEAKER_27]: But by far and away, the most important thing we do, the most powerful thing we do,

422
00:44:22,021 --> 00:44:24,762
[SPEAKER_27]: is work with students to help them help us.

423
00:44:25,502 --> 00:44:29,423
[SPEAKER_27]: And Michael will talk about the students, but I just want to mention the format.

424
00:44:29,503 --> 00:44:30,664
[SPEAKER_27]: There is a structure to this.

425
00:44:31,744 --> 00:44:41,207
[SPEAKER_27]: The structure is called project-based learning, where students on their own, with the help of the, they pick their own projects, but the advisors help them implement a project.

426
00:44:41,407 --> 00:44:42,307
[SPEAKER_27]: So they have to plan it.

427
00:44:42,407 --> 00:44:43,227
[SPEAKER_27]: They have to implement it.

428
00:44:43,247 --> 00:44:44,768
[SPEAKER_27]: They have to cooperate.

429
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:45,708
[SPEAKER_27]: They have to communicate.

430
00:44:46,172 --> 00:44:48,693
[SPEAKER_27]: So the project is really a powerful tool for learning.

431
00:44:49,974 --> 00:44:55,597
[SPEAKER_27]: I was always a fan of that as an educator, and now we can actually put into effect in this program.

432
00:44:56,798 --> 00:45:02,982
[SPEAKER_27]: So when they're completing with their projects, they have such a sense of satisfaction.

433
00:45:03,342 --> 00:45:08,645
[SPEAKER_27]: And it's actually been proven that it's a natural high, that endorphins actually are released when they complete a project.

434
00:45:08,685 --> 00:45:14,628
[SPEAKER_27]: So it might be a counterweight to some negative addictions by having a positive addiction.

435
00:45:16,291 --> 00:45:19,873
[SPEAKER_27]: And also, there are things called ACEs, which are Adverse Childhood Experiences.

436
00:45:20,373 --> 00:45:27,697
[SPEAKER_27]: There's been research on that that correlates with problems growing up in school and living a life.

437
00:45:28,478 --> 00:45:31,139
[SPEAKER_27]: And this activity is a counterweight for that.

438
00:45:31,259 --> 00:45:38,503
[SPEAKER_27]: It's a positive way of directing the students to a positive thing to help counterbalance the negative that they've gone through.

439
00:45:39,804 --> 00:45:42,365
[SPEAKER_27]: And students who come into this program don't just come in for the projects.

440
00:45:42,405 --> 00:45:45,467
[SPEAKER_27]: They come in for a social aspect, to be with other students,

441
00:45:45,948 --> 00:45:52,073
[SPEAKER_27]: They also come because they got a chance to work with the community and they actually have a place to go.

442
00:45:52,473 --> 00:45:54,335
[SPEAKER_27]: We don't have any requirements whatsoever.

443
00:45:54,375 --> 00:45:55,896
[SPEAKER_27]: There's no athletics, there's no grades.

444
00:45:56,316 --> 00:45:59,459
[SPEAKER_27]: It's strictly you wanna be with us and you wanna help make the world a better place.

445
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:02,741
[SPEAKER_27]: So I think I've said too much already.

446
00:46:03,402 --> 00:46:09,527
[SPEAKER_27]: What I'd like to do now is we'll wait for questions till after Michael speaks and the students, then we can do some questions.

447
00:46:09,587 --> 00:46:13,510
[SPEAKER_27]: And in the meantime, my great partner, Michael Skorka.

448
00:46:14,132 --> 00:46:14,612
[SPEAKER_22]: Thanks, Rich.

449
00:46:15,253 --> 00:46:22,519
[SPEAKER_22]: Rich actually said a lot of what I already have prepared for you tonight, but I just want to reiterate one thing that Rich said.

450
00:46:22,879 --> 00:46:30,245
[SPEAKER_22]: We started with 18 students at the high school, and fast forward four years, we have 150 students at the high school.

451
00:46:30,645 --> 00:46:32,727
[SPEAKER_22]: This, as Rich said, the structure works.

452
00:46:33,287 --> 00:46:36,870
[SPEAKER_22]: The students are excited about doing projects even after school is over.

453
00:46:37,190 --> 00:46:38,211
[SPEAKER_22]: This program proves that.

454
00:46:38,291 --> 00:46:39,493
[SPEAKER_22]: They want to help people.

455
00:46:39,613 --> 00:46:41,135
[SPEAKER_22]: They want to be involved in their community.

456
00:46:41,175 --> 00:46:42,336
[SPEAKER_22]: They want to make a difference.

457
00:46:42,676 --> 00:46:53,429
[SPEAKER_22]: I have students in my room at 7 o'clock in the morning all the way until 4 at night that are just literally, they are craving that,

458
00:46:56,172 --> 00:46:59,054
[SPEAKER_22]: that drive to help other people.

459
00:46:59,614 --> 00:47:04,638
[SPEAKER_22]: And I'm seeing that not only at the high school, but also at the elementary schools and the middle schools.

460
00:47:05,638 --> 00:47:11,522
[SPEAKER_22]: We have, as Rich said, over just about 500 students in the district that are participating in the program.

461
00:47:12,823 --> 00:47:21,789
[SPEAKER_22]: And when I meet with the advisors, we meet monthly to just brainstorm ideas, support one another, talk about fundraisers, talk about how we can support the students, better support them.

462
00:47:22,329 --> 00:47:28,172
[SPEAKER_22]: And all of them have told me that this is one of the best experiences they've ever had, to be able to do this work with these students.

463
00:47:28,212 --> 00:47:32,614
[SPEAKER_22]: And it's enriching, and we're essentially empowering students to make the world a better place.

464
00:47:33,075 --> 00:47:39,778
[SPEAKER_22]: And these skills, they're not only, like Rich said, they're not only learning, they're not only benefiting because they're helping other people, but they're learning life skills.

465
00:47:40,478 --> 00:47:51,287
[SPEAKER_22]: High school students, I just had a student who was nervous to make a phone call to a local business because they don't make a lot of phone calls, and so we had to walk through what that looked like, walk through what a formal email looks like.

466
00:47:51,627 --> 00:47:56,791
[SPEAKER_22]: Those life skills that they're gonna be able to take with them after they graduate from high school are super important.

467
00:47:56,871 --> 00:48:00,674
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'm gonna reiterate also, I'd like to thank every one of you.

468
00:48:01,194 --> 00:48:07,339
[SPEAKER_22]: Many of you were here when this program was merely a concept, and you supported us from the very beginning, and look where we are now.

469
00:48:07,419 --> 00:48:08,800
[SPEAKER_22]: So from the bottom of our hearts,

470
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:12,223
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you so much, and thank you to Central Administration who has supported us.

471
00:48:13,304 --> 00:48:18,369
[SPEAKER_22]: It's been a wild ride in a really awesome way, and I can't wait to see what we do next.

472
00:48:18,929 --> 00:48:26,036
[SPEAKER_22]: You'll hear from three student groups tonight who will express not only what the CCSR means to them, but also talk a little bit about their projects.

473
00:48:27,137 --> 00:48:29,900
[SPEAKER_22]: So without further ado, first up is Maria Rocha.

474
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:48,577
[SPEAKER_21]: Hello, my name is Maria Rocha and I am the founder and coordinator of the CCSR Tufts QuestBridge Chapter Resource and Mentoring Program.

475
00:48:49,117 --> 00:49:09,622
[SPEAKER_21]: We are mentoring 40 plus first generation and low income high school students in skills such as professional development and college readiness in innovative ways such as bi-weekly email newsletters and the opportunity to get their questions answered by real college students who are part of our mentor team through Google Forms.

476
00:49:10,403 --> 00:49:14,976
[SPEAKER_21]: And now, one of our mentors would like to share a few words about the importance of our program.

477
00:49:17,027 --> 00:49:17,668
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, everyone.

478
00:49:17,828 --> 00:49:18,889
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm Leticia Rocha.

479
00:49:18,909 --> 00:49:20,830
[SPEAKER_12]: I am a senior at Tufts University.

480
00:49:21,471 --> 00:49:26,295
[SPEAKER_12]: I was president of the Tufts Quest chapter for two years, and I'm now a member of the mentoring team.

481
00:49:26,795 --> 00:49:30,999
[SPEAKER_12]: We work to foster community among first-generation low-income students at Tufts.

482
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:36,604
[SPEAKER_12]: And while we do a lot for them during their time at Tufts, the actual road to college is incredibly difficult.

483
00:49:36,884 --> 00:49:41,848
[SPEAKER_12]: And it is crucial that we provide resources for first-generation and low-income high school students

484
00:49:42,393 --> 00:49:46,480
[SPEAKER_12]: in order to get them into higher education and close the achievement gap.

485
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:47,361
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

486
00:49:48,523 --> 00:49:54,513
[SPEAKER_21]: Now I'd like to introduce Mark Allen and Kishana Paul, who are going to talk about the Haitian Flag Day celebration.

487
00:50:01,813 --> 00:50:08,161
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, to understand where we're going, I must make a quick look back at last year.

488
00:50:08,581 --> 00:50:17,973
[SPEAKER_01]: Last year, we took the passion that many Haitian students felt at our school, and we made the first district-wide Haitian Flag Day assembly and celebration.

489
00:50:18,373 --> 00:50:19,154
[SPEAKER_01]: So last year,

490
00:50:19,875 --> 00:50:26,358
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a Haitian flag day assembly where we portrayed our culture and we represented many aspects and the dance, the music.

491
00:50:26,898 --> 00:50:38,402
[SPEAKER_01]: And afterwards we also, we also went to the elementary school and middle schools in the morning to share a bit of that passion and talk with the kids, inspire them so they can be proud of their identity and self.

492
00:50:38,582 --> 00:50:40,943
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd like to pass it to Kishana to tell us where we're going.

493
00:50:40,963 --> 00:50:41,363
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

494
00:50:41,463 --> 00:50:45,325
[SPEAKER_03]: So after we had our assembly, we had a celebration after school.

495
00:50:45,843 --> 00:50:48,404
[SPEAKER_03]: So we had parents and local businesses bring in food.

496
00:50:48,444 --> 00:50:51,205
[SPEAKER_03]: Some was donated to us, and everybody experienced Haitian food.

497
00:50:51,225 --> 00:50:54,727
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a DJ, which everyone was dancing, and everybody enjoyed.

498
00:50:55,307 --> 00:50:59,769
[SPEAKER_03]: And this year, we hope to make it bigger and include more students from Medford High.

499
00:50:59,789 --> 00:51:04,391
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's more diverse, and everybody gets to learn about the Haitian culture, not just the Haitians from Medford High in general.

500
00:51:05,131 --> 00:51:05,592
[SPEAKER_18]: Very nice.

501
00:51:06,392 --> 00:51:07,793
[SPEAKER_03]: Great job.

502
00:51:09,653 --> 00:51:14,515
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I'd like to call some other amazing CCSR members, Jacqueline Madigan and Emily McDade.

503
00:51:19,764 --> 00:51:20,785
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello, good evening.

504
00:51:21,245 --> 00:51:24,526
[SPEAKER_10]: My name is Jacqueline Madigan, and I'm currently a senior at Medford High School.

505
00:51:25,427 --> 00:51:30,709
[SPEAKER_10]: I have been a member of CCSR for two years, and last year I became a project portfolio manager with Emily McDade.

506
00:51:31,489 --> 00:51:43,115
[SPEAKER_10]: Emily and I are responsible for assisting Mr. Skorka in the creation of the project portfolios for every school in the district, as well as the mid-year and annual reports, which we report to the Cummings Foundation that are so kind to provide us with things that we need.

507
00:51:43,875 --> 00:51:48,017
[SPEAKER_10]: Currently I am training two sophomores to take on the role after Emily and I graduate.

508
00:51:49,026 --> 00:51:58,352
[SPEAKER_10]: I love my role within the CCSR because I get the opportunity to work with and, more importantly, be amazed by varying passions of the different students and their longing to change the world.

509
00:51:58,912 --> 00:52:05,156
[SPEAKER_10]: CCSR has taught me the importance of pursuing my passions, being vocal in my beliefs, and collaborating with my peers.

510
00:52:05,777 --> 00:52:10,820
[SPEAKER_10]: Working with others to create change under a common goal is extremely powerful and very motivating.

511
00:52:11,441 --> 00:52:15,063
[SPEAKER_10]: And to me, that is what makes the CCSR program invaluable to any other program.

512
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:20,789
[SPEAKER_10]: These life skills are fundamental in working towards change and have allowed me to build a strong foundation for college.

513
00:52:21,190 --> 00:52:28,660
[SPEAKER_10]: I plan to take what Mr. Skorka and the CCR program has taught me and use it to continue my love of community service in college, and for that I am very grateful.

514
00:52:31,325 --> 00:52:35,249
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello everybody, my name is Emily McDade and I'm also a senior at Medford High School.

515
00:52:35,410 --> 00:52:42,057
[SPEAKER_08]: As Jackie mentioned, Jackie and I are the portfolio managers which we create the annual and mid-year reports.

516
00:52:42,578 --> 00:52:46,722
[SPEAKER_08]: This year I am also working with Jackie on Common Ground.

517
00:52:46,862 --> 00:52:49,145
[SPEAKER_08]: Common Ground is a reverse inclusion classroom.

518
00:52:49,605 --> 00:52:53,490
[SPEAKER_08]: that allows high school students to form connections with students within the ACCESS program.

519
00:52:53,910 --> 00:52:58,956
[SPEAKER_08]: The ACCESS program is a program within Medford High School that allows students with significant disabilities.

520
00:52:59,436 --> 00:53:05,443
[SPEAKER_08]: The goal was to incorporate students in common ground with classroom activities to feel included within the Medford High School community.

521
00:53:06,837 --> 00:53:10,180
[SPEAKER_08]: Ava Heinegg, who is not here tonight, Jackie and I worked alongside Ms.

522
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:14,144
[SPEAKER_08]: Andre to create an environment in which the students could participate and feel welcome.

523
00:53:14,724 --> 00:53:20,129
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of the different activities included recognizing the uniquenesses of each individual and team building.

524
00:53:20,649 --> 00:53:29,017
[SPEAKER_08]: We hope to eventually make common ground available to all students throughout the day, not only just one period a day, so that the students in the access program are more involved in the community

525
00:53:29,458 --> 00:53:33,067
[SPEAKER_08]: and gain relationships that will continue outside of the classroom.

526
00:53:33,609 --> 00:53:37,038
[SPEAKER_08]: On behalf of CCSR, we would like to thank everyone for listening to us tonight.

527
00:53:44,392 --> 00:53:49,473
[SPEAKER_22]: So I am so excited to be able to work with these students.

528
00:53:49,573 --> 00:53:50,474
[SPEAKER_22]: And like I said, 150.

529
00:53:51,554 --> 00:53:54,375
[SPEAKER_22]: Last year at the high school, we had 58 projects.

530
00:53:54,475 --> 00:53:59,596
[SPEAKER_22]: And we're already up to 80 projects at the high school alone, which is incredible.

531
00:53:59,876 --> 00:54:04,738
[SPEAKER_22]: And I know that the work that they're doing is really making a difference.

532
00:54:04,758 --> 00:54:08,839
[SPEAKER_22]: This program really does have an impact on the world and in our community.

533
00:54:10,299 --> 00:54:11,700
[SPEAKER_22]: Rich, I don't know if you want to say one more thing.

534
00:54:11,821 --> 00:54:19,067
[SPEAKER_27]: I just want one more informational thing that we actually now incorporated the key club in our group.

535
00:54:19,348 --> 00:54:28,716
[SPEAKER_27]: They're going to work with us and help us and we're going to help them so that there's a unified force, so to speak, to do projects and help out the rest of the community.

536
00:54:28,736 --> 00:54:31,299
[SPEAKER_27]: Do we have any questions?

537
00:54:31,958 --> 00:54:37,120
[SPEAKER_17]: I think just, well, another shout out to the Cummings Foundation, the Crystal Campbell Betterment.

538
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:38,741
[SPEAKER_27]: Continue the rest of the Betterment.

539
00:54:39,241 --> 00:54:40,262
[SPEAKER_17]: Community Betterment Project.

540
00:54:40,282 --> 00:54:42,022
[SPEAKER_17]: Community Benefit Project.

541
00:54:42,242 --> 00:54:42,983
[SPEAKER_27]: I knew there were others.

542
00:54:43,003 --> 00:54:46,904
[SPEAKER_27]: And of course, the Bloomberg Foundation that started the organization.

543
00:54:46,924 --> 00:54:47,925
[SPEAKER_27]: We're hoping that he remembers that, too.

544
00:54:54,448 --> 00:54:55,568
[SPEAKER_09]: First, I'll start at the top.

545
00:54:55,608 --> 00:55:00,070
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to thank you, Michael and Rich, for coming tonight and for updating us.

546
00:55:00,570 --> 00:55:03,491
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, we know what a positive thing this is.

547
00:55:03,932 --> 00:55:10,534
[SPEAKER_09]: And as I've been sitting here and reading some of the other projects that happened at the elementary level, something else occurred to me.

548
00:55:10,954 --> 00:55:28,245
[SPEAKER_09]: So first, at the elementary level, I happened to look in my book and one was teal pumpkin awareness for letting the community know more about the teal pumpkins means on Halloween, that there are non-food items available in case kids have allergies.

549
00:55:28,705 --> 00:55:32,467
[SPEAKER_09]: And another one, you know, more books for little free libraries.

550
00:55:32,507 --> 00:55:33,808
[SPEAKER_09]: We see the little free libraries

551
00:55:34,468 --> 00:55:36,009
[SPEAKER_09]: popping up, but not enough kids books.

552
00:55:36,049 --> 00:55:37,010
[SPEAKER_09]: So that was another one.

553
00:55:37,510 --> 00:55:47,956
[SPEAKER_09]: And all of a sudden, as I was thinking about this, I was thinking, because of course, we know what fantastic high school projects we've had and how wonderful you just represented yourself.

554
00:55:48,577 --> 00:55:58,263
[SPEAKER_09]: But when I go to the music concerts, one of the things I'm always struck about is how when people, students get up at that spring concert,

555
00:55:58,843 --> 00:56:08,248
[SPEAKER_09]: They often thank the music teachers because it is the music teachers who have continuity from the elementary to the middle to the high school.

556
00:56:08,808 --> 00:56:15,312
[SPEAKER_09]: And what we've now managed to build with the CCSR is that there's a continuity.

557
00:56:15,792 --> 00:56:31,262
[SPEAKER_09]: of ideals going from the elementary to the middle to the high school and soon because of this while the time the kids get to the high school of course we'll always be welcoming more new high school students but we'll also be building the space that will come up

558
00:56:31,742 --> 00:56:34,003
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's an incredibly powerful thing.

559
00:56:34,463 --> 00:56:40,684
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm very appreciative of the success that we've had and the building that we've done over the years.

560
00:56:41,544 --> 00:56:54,227
[SPEAKER_09]: I did just want to mention to Marie, I read an article, I believe it was the Boston Globe, just a week or so ago, talking about how difficult it was that while our students from less

561
00:56:55,447 --> 00:57:07,590
[SPEAKER_09]: Students perhaps who come from families who were their first time college students, while they might get into college, it's difficult for them to stay into college and they're not necessarily prepared for all of the challenges.

562
00:57:08,050 --> 00:57:13,912
[SPEAKER_09]: And laying that base now for them to be able to talk to college students is just wonderful.

563
00:57:14,112 --> 00:57:21,373
[SPEAKER_09]: All of the projects we heard tonight were wonderful and I can't wait to hear about all the other ones that will be happening from all the levels.

564
00:57:21,613 --> 00:57:22,314
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much.

565
00:57:24,751 --> 00:57:24,951
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

566
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:25,271
[SPEAKER_17]: Kretz.

567
00:57:26,532 --> 00:57:28,334
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, hi.

568
00:57:28,574 --> 00:57:30,155
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you very much for the presentation.

569
00:57:30,215 --> 00:57:34,719
[SPEAKER_24]: It's one of my favorite presentations, and the annual report is beautiful.

570
00:57:34,739 --> 00:57:37,921
[SPEAKER_24]: I just want to thank the students for the great job and the great work they did.

571
00:57:38,342 --> 00:57:40,904
[SPEAKER_24]: The pictures are beautiful, the articles, just perfect.

572
00:57:41,624 --> 00:57:47,269
[SPEAKER_24]: All the projects presented tonight were fantastic, and I did what Paulette says, I look forward to

573
00:57:47,629 --> 00:57:58,059
[SPEAKER_24]: all the upcoming events and just going to all the presentations and it's just so wonderful and the kids are so excited and it's so exciting that they're starting in elementary and then going to middle.

574
00:57:58,179 --> 00:58:08,068
[SPEAKER_24]: I can't imagine the upcoming years what we're going to see in the upper grades because these children are starting younger now and it's their idea, their vision.

575
00:58:08,468 --> 00:58:25,643
[SPEAKER_24]: their voice, and you know, I just heard so many students at the presentations last year, they speak so well, and their leadership skills, and they're great speakers, public speakers, better than me sometimes, so I'm really impressed with the students and all the presentations, and thank you all so much.

576
00:58:26,264 --> 00:58:26,704
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

577
00:58:26,924 --> 00:58:30,648
[SPEAKER_27]: Just so you know, that the McGlynn Elementary has over 60 students?

578
00:58:30,688 --> 00:58:32,690
[SPEAKER_22]: The McGlynn Elementary, 66, yeah, I think.

579
00:58:32,850 --> 00:58:34,351
[SPEAKER_27]: Elementary students at one school.

580
00:58:34,551 --> 00:58:34,751
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

581
00:58:35,812 --> 00:58:36,052
[SPEAKER_22]: And Ms.

582
00:58:36,092 --> 00:58:42,455
[SPEAKER_22]: Kretz also, and for everyone, the project fair at the high school is scheduled for April 30th, if you wanna put it in your calendars.

583
00:58:42,875 --> 00:58:50,919
[SPEAKER_22]: I will also be disseminating the information for the project fairs for the other schools when I have that information, probably sometime in January.

584
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:54,401
[SPEAKER_22]: And Curtis Tufts is also part of this program, just to be very clear.

585
00:58:54,721 --> 00:58:56,382
[SPEAKER_22]: They are participating in the program.

586
00:58:56,422 --> 00:59:03,665
[SPEAKER_22]: The principal, I think she's a new principal, is on board, and we've been in contact, and we're working together to do some projects with her 15 or so students there.

587
00:59:04,766 --> 00:59:04,986
[SPEAKER_16]: Great.

588
00:59:05,286 --> 00:59:06,026
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Benedetto.

589
00:59:06,466 --> 00:59:06,847
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

590
00:59:08,247 --> 00:59:09,987
[SPEAKER_16]: My question is more about funding.

591
00:59:10,147 --> 00:59:18,069
[SPEAKER_16]: This program is now so important to our community, our school community, as well as our community as a whole.

592
00:59:19,330 --> 00:59:33,293
[SPEAKER_16]: If for any reason this grant doesn't come through, we need to make sure that there's a plan B. I'm sure my colleagues, as the year continues, will help you in the budget if that wasn't to come about.

593
00:59:33,982 --> 00:59:40,105
[SPEAKER_16]: And somehow some way, but are there is there a plan B other than the Cummings are we reaching out to?

594
00:59:40,285 --> 00:59:42,647
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Bloomberg again, what are we doing?

595
00:59:42,667 --> 00:59:53,712
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, one of the things that I do When Michael's working with students is I'm doing outreach all the time whether it's promoting the program Trying to get other districts to buy into it are raising money.

596
00:59:53,732 --> 00:59:53,753
[SPEAKER_27]: I

597
00:59:55,188 --> 00:59:57,510
[SPEAKER_27]: We have some connections, we have some things going on.

598
00:59:57,550 --> 00:59:58,610
[SPEAKER_27]: We're not going to stop doing that.

599
00:59:59,011 --> 01:00:05,796
[SPEAKER_27]: There are other grants, and if it doesn't happen, we'll know before budget so we can think about that.

600
01:00:06,216 --> 01:00:11,920
[SPEAKER_27]: But right now, we won't find out until May, but I think the budget's done in June, so we should be okay.

601
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:15,202
[SPEAKER_27]: But I'm confident we'll find more money and more support as we go on,

602
01:00:16,586 --> 01:00:29,741
[SPEAKER_27]: The program is becoming more well-known, and I've gone to the conferences, the superintendents' conference, the school committee conference, and I've met people, and I think people are starting to see what we're about at other districts and other funders.

603
01:00:30,522 --> 01:00:32,444
[SPEAKER_27]: And I haven't given up on Bloomberg yet, either.

604
01:00:33,501 --> 01:00:34,962
[SPEAKER_16]: And what costs are involved?

605
01:00:35,263 --> 01:00:38,485
[SPEAKER_16]: Like, what do you need each year to be able to run this program?

606
01:00:38,545 --> 01:00:51,557
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, if we put it out there and people are listening and they hear these children, there might be a donor out there that is listening right now or at some point and hear what you need and be able to step up and help us.

607
01:00:51,617 --> 01:00:55,320
[SPEAKER_16]: So if anybody's listening, we could use checks for CCSR.

608
01:00:55,360 --> 01:01:00,945
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, the biggest item are the stipends for all the advisors and teachers.

609
01:01:01,795 --> 01:01:02,716
[SPEAKER_27]: Because we have so many now.

610
01:01:02,736 --> 01:01:03,656
[SPEAKER_27]: We have about a dozen.

611
01:01:04,616 --> 01:01:05,637
[SPEAKER_27]: So that's the biggest budget.

612
01:01:05,657 --> 01:01:10,959
[SPEAKER_27]: The other things are speakers, sometimes field trips, supplies, printing supplies.

613
01:01:11,019 --> 01:01:11,799
[SPEAKER_27]: We do print things.

614
01:01:12,740 --> 01:01:16,141
[SPEAKER_27]: So we kind of focused on that.

615
01:01:16,482 --> 01:01:24,305
[SPEAKER_27]: We took some money away from other things to make sure that we have enough money for the advisors and the teachers and some mini grants.

616
01:01:24,405 --> 01:01:25,846
[SPEAKER_27]: That's the bulk of our budget.

617
01:01:27,146 --> 01:01:27,486
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

618
01:01:27,506 --> 01:01:27,867
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

619
01:01:29,067 --> 01:01:31,108
[SPEAKER_17]: School committee elect McLaughlin.

620
01:01:32,149 --> 01:01:32,509
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

621
01:01:33,551 --> 01:01:34,652
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you for the presentation.

622
01:01:35,233 --> 01:01:38,357
[SPEAKER_26]: I just wanted to tell you, I think you're such a jewel in Medford's crown.

623
01:01:38,577 --> 01:01:42,762
[SPEAKER_26]: I think that you really stand out, especially in terms of how inclusive you are.

624
01:01:43,310 --> 01:01:47,452
[SPEAKER_26]: of children that are often marginalized, and you are always thoughtful in that sense.

625
01:01:47,492 --> 01:02:01,499
[SPEAKER_26]: So as a mother of a child with a disability, I especially appreciate your Common Ground project, and also your mention of the Curtis Tufts program, and anything that we can do to continue that work, we're happy to support.

626
01:02:01,659 --> 01:02:02,019
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

627
01:02:02,039 --> 01:02:02,319
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

628
01:02:02,359 --> 01:02:02,880
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you so much.

629
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:04,701
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you very much.

630
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:06,242
[SPEAKER_17]: That was a wonderful presentation.

631
01:02:06,262 --> 01:02:09,043
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm in honor of all of you.

632
01:02:09,063 --> 01:02:10,244
[SPEAKER_17]: You do an amazing job.

633
01:02:10,584 --> 01:02:13,826
[SPEAKER_17]: So professional, so articulate, and just a great job.

634
01:02:13,886 --> 01:02:14,347
[SPEAKER_17]: Keep it up.

635
01:02:14,687 --> 01:02:16,788
[SPEAKER_17]: Carry it outside of Medford and come home with it.

636
01:02:16,868 --> 01:02:18,429
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you, Mayor.

637
01:02:18,449 --> 01:02:18,889
[SPEAKER_17]: You're welcome.

638
01:02:19,250 --> 01:02:19,670
[SPEAKER_17]: Congratulations.

639
01:02:26,260 --> 01:02:30,002
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there a motion to accept this report and place it on file, Mr. Russo?

640
01:02:30,062 --> 01:02:30,643
[SPEAKER_17]: Seconded by Ms.

641
01:02:30,663 --> 01:02:31,183
[SPEAKER_17]: Van De Kloot.

642
01:02:31,243 --> 01:02:32,023
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor?

643
01:02:32,043 --> 01:02:32,103
[SPEAKER_17]: Aye.

644
01:02:32,784 --> 01:02:33,584
[SPEAKER_17]: All those opposed?

645
01:02:34,044 --> 01:02:34,825
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes.

646
01:02:35,365 --> 01:02:38,887
[SPEAKER_17]: Item three, recommendation to approve student representatives to the school committee.

647
01:02:38,927 --> 01:02:39,768
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. DeLava.

648
01:02:44,510 --> 01:02:44,670
[SPEAKER_17]: Ah.

649
01:02:45,811 --> 01:02:47,592
[SPEAKER_17]: We got a surprise.

650
01:02:47,652 --> 01:02:48,953
[SPEAKER_02]: Mark has a double role today.

651
01:02:48,973 --> 01:02:49,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Surprise.

652
01:02:49,633 --> 01:02:54,236
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to introduce Mark Allen,

653
01:02:56,676 --> 01:03:04,567
[SPEAKER_02]: Our senior class officers, Mark is the senior class president and Isabel is the senior class secretary.

654
01:03:05,586 --> 01:03:09,309
[SPEAKER_02]: Both students are enrolled in our AP and honors classes as well.

655
01:03:09,329 --> 01:03:15,214
[SPEAKER_02]: And we feel that each would have a great voice representing Medford High School and Medford Vocational Technical High School.

656
01:03:15,855 --> 01:03:18,977
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'd like to introduce them as your student representative.

657
01:03:19,037 --> 01:03:22,800
[SPEAKER_02]: As you know, one will be at one meeting and one will be at another meeting.

658
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:27,044
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can allow them to also get their homework done as well.

659
01:03:27,544 --> 01:03:28,905
[SPEAKER_02]: So having the two is present.

660
01:03:28,965 --> 01:03:31,347
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're here tonight to answer any of your questions.

661
01:03:31,387 --> 01:03:34,270
[SPEAKER_02]: So feel free to ask them anything you'd like.

662
01:03:34,637 --> 01:03:38,360
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, if I could, from the chair, always feel free to interject.

663
01:03:38,641 --> 01:03:48,650
[SPEAKER_17]: As you've probably watched over the years, we've had some outstanding school students that have represented you, and they have jumped in often with strong voices.

664
01:03:48,750 --> 01:03:50,351
[SPEAKER_17]: So feel free to do that.

665
01:03:50,391 --> 01:03:53,294
[SPEAKER_17]: You're always welcome to have a few words and say whatever's on your mind.

666
01:03:53,874 --> 01:03:54,395
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you very much.

667
01:03:54,455 --> 01:03:55,115
[SPEAKER_17]: OK, both of you.

668
01:03:55,135 --> 01:03:55,736
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

669
01:03:55,756 --> 01:03:56,577
[SPEAKER_17]: Congratulations.

670
01:03:56,717 --> 01:03:57,598
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you very much.

671
01:03:58,158 --> 01:03:58,318
[SPEAKER_17]: Ms.

672
01:03:58,358 --> 01:03:58,779
[SPEAKER_17]: Vandekloot.

673
01:04:01,182 --> 01:04:06,284
[SPEAKER_09]: is that you'll come and sit over there in that chair, and you can ask us any questions that you want.

674
01:04:06,324 --> 01:04:07,324
[SPEAKER_09]: You can participate.

675
01:04:07,704 --> 01:04:13,246
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you have any questions before a meeting, we'd be happy to, you know, please reach out to us.

676
01:04:13,726 --> 01:04:18,768
[SPEAKER_09]: Your voice is extremely important, and I am so glad we are finally getting this student voice back.

677
01:04:19,068 --> 01:04:19,788
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

678
01:04:19,808 --> 01:04:20,548
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

679
01:04:21,569 --> 01:04:22,389
[SPEAKER_17]: And Mr. Russo.

680
01:04:23,312 --> 01:04:41,697
[SPEAKER_06]: just wanted to echo what Mayor Burke had said because we have often after these meetings remarked that, no disrespect to any of the excellent people that work for us, but often the commentary from the students was some of the most important part of the discussion.

681
01:04:41,857 --> 01:04:48,279
[SPEAKER_06]: So it may be hard to recognize that at first, but please don't hold back.

682
01:04:49,079 --> 01:04:51,900
[SPEAKER_17]: You see things through a different lens than us, so we welcome it.

683
01:04:52,951 --> 01:04:53,412
[SPEAKER_17]: Very good.

684
01:04:53,732 --> 01:04:54,072
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

685
01:04:54,112 --> 01:04:56,254
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll see you coming January?

686
01:04:57,836 --> 01:04:58,757
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going really soon.

687
01:04:59,558 --> 01:04:59,718
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

688
01:04:59,738 --> 01:04:59,978
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

689
01:05:00,158 --> 01:05:01,019
[SPEAKER_01]: We're working on it.

690
01:05:01,119 --> 01:05:01,399
[SPEAKER_17]: OK.

691
01:05:01,620 --> 01:05:02,160
[SPEAKER_17]: Very good.

692
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:04,002
[SPEAKER_20]: Two weeks.

693
01:05:04,082 --> 01:05:05,063
[SPEAKER_17]: Awesome.

694
01:05:05,083 --> 01:05:07,225
[SPEAKER_17]: You'll see one of us soon.

695
01:05:07,505 --> 01:05:08,967
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I look forward to it.

696
01:05:08,987 --> 01:05:09,227
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

697
01:05:09,307 --> 01:05:09,688
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, guys.

698
01:05:09,708 --> 01:05:10,668
[SPEAKER_17]: Congratulations.

699
01:05:10,688 --> 01:05:11,489
[SPEAKER_17]: Have a great Thanksgiving.

700
01:05:11,509 --> 01:05:11,950
[SPEAKER_17]: Good evening.

701
01:05:17,176 --> 01:05:22,598
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there a recommendation to approve the two student representatives by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Ms.

702
01:05:22,638 --> 01:05:22,938
[SPEAKER_17]: Kretz?

703
01:05:23,018 --> 01:05:23,778
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor?

704
01:05:23,798 --> 01:05:23,898
[SPEAKER_17]: Aye.

705
01:05:24,799 --> 01:05:25,479
[SPEAKER_17]: All those opposed?

706
01:05:25,559 --> 01:05:26,359
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes.

707
01:05:26,579 --> 01:05:27,799
[SPEAKER_17]: Congratulations formally.

708
01:05:29,380 --> 01:05:33,861
[SPEAKER_17]: Item number four, recognition of Dr. Jeanne Hollenbeck, AOTA roster of fellows.

709
01:05:33,921 --> 01:05:34,122
[SPEAKER_17]: Ms.

710
01:05:34,162 --> 01:05:34,722
[SPEAKER_17]: Caldwell.

711
01:05:35,182 --> 01:05:41,024
[SPEAKER_14]: So we always celebrate our kids and I'm the first one to get up and celebrate our students because we are.

712
01:05:41,044 --> 01:05:41,244
[SPEAKER_14]: Kiddos.

713
01:05:42,007 --> 01:05:43,708
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, you always say kiddos.

714
01:05:43,848 --> 01:05:44,308
[SPEAKER_14]: Kiddos.

715
01:05:44,348 --> 01:05:45,529
[SPEAKER_14]: I do say kiddos all the time.

716
01:05:46,170 --> 01:05:48,191
[SPEAKER_14]: So, but tonight is something different.

717
01:05:48,311 --> 01:06:04,220
[SPEAKER_14]: So tonight I am very, very proud to congratulate Dr. Jan Hollenbeck for the honor of being chosen to receive the American Occupational Therapy Association roster of fellows at the 2020 Annual Conference and Expo in Boston.

718
01:06:04,241 --> 01:06:06,462
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd like to introduce to you Dr. Jan Hollenbeck.

719
01:06:12,375 --> 01:06:16,037
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'll just read to you a little bit about what this entails.

720
01:06:16,818 --> 01:06:35,409
[SPEAKER_14]: The AOTA Roster of Fellows recognizes occupational therapist members of AOTA who through their knowledge, expertise, leadership, advocacy, and or guidance have made a significant contribution over time to the profession with a measured impact on consumers,

721
01:06:35,909 --> 01:06:39,753
[SPEAKER_14]: of occupational services and or members of the association.

722
01:06:40,354 --> 01:06:42,596
[SPEAKER_14]: So we congratulate you for your recognition.

723
01:06:42,636 --> 01:06:46,379
[SPEAKER_14]: We are very proud and happy that she works for Medford Public Schools.

724
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:47,220
[SPEAKER_14]: How long have you been with us?

725
01:06:48,662 --> 01:06:49,162
[SPEAKER_14]: A long time?

726
01:06:49,182 --> 01:06:49,482
[SPEAKER_13]: 25 years.

727
01:06:56,619 --> 01:06:58,660
[SPEAKER_17]: We also have a proclamation for you.

728
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:01,941
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll read it and then if you want to come up and get it.

729
01:07:01,961 --> 01:07:14,845
[SPEAKER_17]: Medford Public Schools is proud to recognize Dr. Jeanne Hollenbeck for being honored by the American Occupational Therapy Association to receive the AOTA Roster of Fellows signed by myself, Dr. Maurice-Edouard Vinson, and all the school committee members.

730
01:07:14,885 --> 01:07:16,286
[SPEAKER_17]: So congratulations.

731
01:07:16,786 --> 01:07:16,986
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

732
01:07:17,006 --> 01:07:20,307
[SPEAKER_17]: You get to go up and get your award now.

733
01:07:35,954 --> 01:07:36,636
[SPEAKER_17]: Congratulations.

734
01:07:36,656 --> 01:07:36,977
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

735
01:07:36,998 --> 01:07:38,041
[SPEAKER_17]: Wonderful accomplishment.

736
01:07:38,262 --> 01:07:39,386
[SPEAKER_17]: Would you like to say a few words?

737
01:07:39,968 --> 01:07:40,509
[SPEAKER_20]: If you'd like to.

738
01:07:44,652 --> 01:07:46,613
[SPEAKER_13]: I appreciate the recognition, I really do.

739
01:07:47,074 --> 01:08:06,313
[SPEAKER_13]: I've been in Medford Public Schools for a very long time, starting as a contracted occupational therapist and then convincing George Scollins, I don't know if folks remember him, and Superintendent Belson to hire me so I could create a department in Medford Public Schools and stop having all these

740
01:08:06,713 --> 01:08:10,474
[SPEAKER_13]: kind of different contracting agencies that was it was a little bit inconsistent.

741
01:08:10,914 --> 01:08:20,575
[SPEAKER_13]: So they allowed me to grow and develop and part of that was the growth and development I did in my profession in general.

742
01:08:20,695 --> 01:08:31,057
[SPEAKER_13]: So stepping into a leadership role in Medford allowed me to step, it was kind of the beginning of the trajectory for me to do the things I've done for my professional organization at a national and state level.

743
01:08:31,957 --> 01:08:35,798
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm really appreciative of Medford Public Schools and allowing me to kind of advance

744
01:08:37,064 --> 01:08:40,406
[SPEAKER_13]: and develop in this role and beyond.

745
01:08:40,927 --> 01:08:41,187
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

746
01:09:13,700 --> 01:09:14,581
[SPEAKER_17]: Congratulations.

747
01:09:16,463 --> 01:09:19,966
[SPEAKER_17]: Item five, recommendation to approve donation for library makerspace.

748
01:09:20,046 --> 01:09:20,306
[SPEAKER_17]: Ms.

749
01:09:20,386 --> 01:09:22,168
[SPEAKER_17]: Layden is present with us this evening.

750
01:09:27,970 --> 01:09:28,410
[SPEAKER_17]: Good evening.

751
01:09:28,871 --> 01:09:29,471
[SPEAKER_23]: Good evening.

752
01:09:29,491 --> 01:09:39,719
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm pleased to let you know that we received a $10,000 grant from the Verizon Foundation to build a maker space in our high school library.

753
01:09:39,959 --> 01:09:41,480
[SPEAKER_23]: It is hopefully the first of our

754
01:09:42,172 --> 01:09:45,933
[SPEAKER_23]: endeavor to put a makerspace in all our libraries, but our first one is the high school.

755
01:09:46,394 --> 01:09:50,355
[SPEAKER_23]: And I'll read you the exact paragraph that was funded, so I'm clear on that one.

756
01:09:50,935 --> 01:10:03,360
[SPEAKER_23]: The maker program of the Medford High School, Medford Vocational and Technical High School, will create a shared STEAM makerspace to be used by core academic subjects and CTE programs to enable academic and career preparation connections.

757
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:06,722
[SPEAKER_23]: So this is part of a STEM initiative through the Verizon Foundation.

758
01:10:06,782 --> 01:10:10,303
[SPEAKER_23]: So they want to fund ideas and concepts that help

759
01:10:10,704 --> 01:10:16,506
[SPEAKER_23]: crossover between CTE and academic subjects with a STEM focus, and so we were well aligned for that.

760
01:10:17,626 --> 01:10:29,530
[SPEAKER_23]: Students and teachers in multiple programs and courses will use the Makerspace to plan, design, create, and synthesize projects using interdisciplinary project-based learning to solve and engage STEAM activities.

761
01:10:30,210 --> 01:10:44,646
[SPEAKER_23]: It's about $10,000 which is broken out into professional development, training, stipends for teachers and students to do training, $5,000 for materials and supplies, curriculum, and information about the project, project dissemination.

762
01:10:45,827 --> 01:11:00,030
[SPEAKER_23]: We actually already have some furniture that has come in from the Furniture Trust that will help use that space in a way that will move from Rich Trotta's old office to our high school library maker space.

763
01:11:01,170 --> 01:11:02,971
[SPEAKER_23]: And it will include high tech and low tech.

764
01:11:02,991 --> 01:11:04,571
[SPEAKER_23]: We're looking at putting in a 3D printer.

765
01:11:05,051 --> 01:11:11,712
[SPEAKER_23]: We're putting in a green screen and some video equipment so that we can do some video casting.

766
01:11:12,332 --> 01:11:13,453
[SPEAKER_23]: We're looking at die cutter.

767
01:11:13,513 --> 01:11:14,493
[SPEAKER_23]: We're looking at tools

768
01:11:15,285 --> 01:11:16,946
[SPEAKER_23]: to take things apart and put things together.

769
01:11:16,986 --> 01:11:19,707
[SPEAKER_23]: So it's a little bit of a lot of things to start that makerspace initiative.

770
01:11:20,187 --> 01:11:20,647
[SPEAKER_17]: Very nice.

771
01:11:20,687 --> 01:11:21,628
[SPEAKER_17]: Congratulations.

772
01:11:21,708 --> 01:11:22,008
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

773
01:11:23,349 --> 01:11:24,389
[SPEAKER_17]: This requires a vote.

774
01:11:24,729 --> 01:11:30,552
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll recommend that this gift be accepted by school committee for a formal vote required under Mass General Law, Chapter 44, Section 53A.

775
01:11:30,572 --> 01:11:32,553
[SPEAKER_17]: $10,000 grant donation from Verizon Foundation.

776
01:11:39,203 --> 01:11:39,944
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion for approval?

777
01:11:41,084 --> 01:11:42,605
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you wish to speak on this?

778
01:11:42,865 --> 01:11:43,025
[SPEAKER_17]: Ms.

779
01:11:43,066 --> 01:11:43,386
[SPEAKER_17]: Kretz.

780
01:11:43,726 --> 01:11:45,487
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, I just had one question.

781
01:11:45,787 --> 01:11:51,711
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, Molly, I was just, I was curious about, so the stipend student, like the student stipend, what would the students be doing?

782
01:11:51,751 --> 01:11:53,112
[SPEAKER_24]: Like, I was just curious about that.

783
01:11:53,152 --> 01:11:55,393
[SPEAKER_23]: So the students could be doing training for other students.

784
01:11:55,433 --> 01:11:57,635
[SPEAKER_23]: The students can be running after school activities.

785
01:11:57,675 --> 01:11:59,876
[SPEAKER_23]: They can be running activities during their free periods.

786
01:11:59,936 --> 01:12:03,078
[SPEAKER_23]: It can be things that can be done for student to teacher, student to student.

787
01:12:03,438 --> 01:12:05,420
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, okay, great, that's great, thank you.

788
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:06,400
[SPEAKER_17]: Very good, thank you, Ms.

789
01:12:06,420 --> 01:12:06,681
[SPEAKER_17]: Kretz.

790
01:12:07,881 --> 01:12:08,141
[SPEAKER_17]: Ms.

791
01:12:08,161 --> 01:12:08,722
[SPEAKER_17]: DiBenedetto.

792
01:12:09,102 --> 01:12:09,442
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

793
01:12:10,163 --> 01:12:12,406
[SPEAKER_16]: How did this money come about?

794
01:12:12,446 --> 01:12:13,607
[SPEAKER_16]: Did you apply for a grant?

795
01:12:14,162 --> 01:12:14,883
[SPEAKER_16]: I applied for a grant.

796
01:12:15,043 --> 01:12:30,616
[SPEAKER_16]: So I just wanted to say thank you very much on behalf of the students and the community, the school community, to take that initiative on and apply for grants that help our students should be recognized because that's very important in tough times.

797
01:12:31,137 --> 01:12:35,000
[SPEAKER_16]: And this gives children an opportunity to work with their hands and their minds.

798
01:12:35,581 --> 01:12:39,424
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's a great benefit that you've just offered all of our children.

799
01:12:39,684 --> 01:12:40,405
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much.

800
01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:42,700
[SPEAKER_17]: And Ms.

801
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:43,221
[SPEAKER_17]: Vander Kloot.

802
01:12:43,561 --> 01:12:45,262
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to say the exact same thing.

803
01:12:45,302 --> 01:12:46,163
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you, Molly.

804
01:12:46,863 --> 01:12:47,564
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Ms.

[SPEAKER_17]: Very good.

807
01:12:49,265 --> 01:12:50,406
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there a motion by Ms.

[SPEAKER_17]: Congratulations, Molly.

813
01:13:13,812 --> 01:13:18,156
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a recommendation to approve the donation from the Hoff family for the cosmetology space.

814
01:13:18,536 --> 01:13:23,320
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Fallon is with us this evening and we previously heard from the superintendent who mentioned this project.

815
01:13:23,781 --> 01:13:23,921
[SPEAKER_15]: Welcome.

816
01:13:23,961 --> 01:13:24,201
[SPEAKER_15]: Good evening.

817
01:13:24,521 --> 01:13:24,902
[SPEAKER_15]: Hello again.

818
01:13:25,522 --> 01:13:26,403
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi.

819
01:13:26,663 --> 01:13:27,784
[SPEAKER_15]: Spoke about it a few weeks ago.

820
01:13:27,844 --> 01:13:30,787
[SPEAKER_15]: Tonight's just a formal acceptance of the money.

821
01:13:30,847 --> 01:13:34,069
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Hoff donated $100,000 to the cosmetology program.

822
01:13:34,510 --> 01:13:36,712
[SPEAKER_15]: Tonight I'm seeking your approval for acceptance of the funds.

823
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:39,424
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion for approval by Ms.

824
01:13:39,444 --> 01:13:41,129
[SPEAKER_17]: Van de Kloot, seconded by Ms.

825
01:13:41,209 --> 01:13:42,333
[SPEAKER_17]: Kretz, I think I heard over there.

826
01:13:42,875 --> 01:13:43,758
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, and this is a $100,000 grant.

827
01:13:45,818 --> 01:13:46,038
[SPEAKER_15]: Gift.

828
01:13:46,659 --> 01:13:47,679
[SPEAKER_17]: Gift from Mr. Hoff.

829
01:13:47,739 --> 01:13:48,060
[SPEAKER_15]: Correct.

830
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:49,381
[SPEAKER_17]: In memory of his mom.

831
01:13:49,581 --> 01:13:49,801
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

832
01:13:50,441 --> 01:13:50,822
[SPEAKER_16]: Very nice.

833
01:13:51,022 --> 01:13:51,702
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Benedetto.

834
01:13:51,782 --> 01:13:52,122
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

835
01:13:52,803 --> 01:14:00,608
[SPEAKER_16]: I just wanted people to know that the current cosmetology is going to remain open while you're building the new area.

836
01:14:00,788 --> 01:14:01,389
[SPEAKER_16]: Is that correct?

837
01:14:01,489 --> 01:14:01,789
[SPEAKER_15]: Correct.

838
01:14:01,829 --> 01:14:06,852
[SPEAKER_15]: The new salon will be up and running in the fall, you know, for the fall school year, but we'll have the new space open hopefully by the spring.

839
01:14:06,872 --> 01:14:09,654
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll have the ribbon cutting in the spring, but everything will still stay operational.

840
01:14:10,054 --> 01:14:10,255
[SPEAKER_16]: Right.

841
01:14:10,455 --> 01:14:15,278
[SPEAKER_16]: So just so the community does know that during construction and during the movement,

842
01:14:15,591 --> 01:14:21,819
[SPEAKER_16]: that they can still go and get treatments and services in the spa currently.

843
01:14:22,019 --> 01:14:22,280
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

844
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:31,391
[SPEAKER_16]: Which when I broke my arm, I took advantage of a few years ago and brought my mom and my sister and everybody got something different meals here.

845
01:14:31,411 --> 01:14:31,451
[SPEAKER_16]: Um,

846
01:14:33,319 --> 01:14:38,163
[SPEAKER_16]: everything, and it was helpful because I had that broken arm, so I appreciated it then.

847
01:14:38,243 --> 01:14:42,566
[SPEAKER_16]: So everybody in the community should really utilize these programs that they have up there.

848
01:14:42,906 --> 01:14:48,070
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know how many customers they're getting right now, but it's a great option.

849
01:14:48,110 --> 01:14:57,778
[SPEAKER_16]: You can get your oil changed, your hair and nails done, or any other cosmetology thing that they offer, and then go to lunch and pick up your car and you're ready to go.

850
01:14:58,538 --> 01:14:59,980
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a great way to spend the day.

851
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:02,862
[SPEAKER_16]: It might take you a little longer to get your hair cut or done,

852
01:15:03,282 --> 01:15:10,672
[SPEAKER_16]: than at your regular spa, but it's really, it's really a great, great program.

853
01:15:11,012 --> 01:15:16,980
[SPEAKER_16]: And just wanted to let everybody know to go to utilize it even while we're relocating.

854
01:15:17,380 --> 01:15:17,781
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

855
01:15:17,801 --> 01:15:18,542
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for your support.

856
01:15:20,210 --> 01:15:32,356
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I just want to make sure that a letter is sent on behalf of the school committee to Mr. Hoff and family for their, at this time, thanking them for the incredibly generous donation.

857
01:15:32,616 --> 01:15:34,157
[SPEAKER_17]: For all of these accepted gifts.

858
01:15:34,837 --> 01:15:35,098
[SPEAKER_15]: Agreed.

859
01:15:35,958 --> 01:15:36,398
[SPEAKER_17]: Very good.

860
01:15:36,418 --> 01:15:37,559
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a motion on the floor.

861
01:15:37,619 --> 01:15:38,479
[SPEAKER_17]: Roll call vote, please.

862
01:15:38,499 --> 01:15:38,639
[SPEAKER_17]: Ms.

863
01:15:38,659 --> 01:15:39,059
[SPEAKER_17]: Mustone.

864
01:15:46,356 --> 01:15:48,899
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, motion passes.

865
01:15:49,359 --> 01:15:50,240
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you very much.

866
01:15:52,222 --> 01:15:57,747
[SPEAKER_17]: Next, recommendation to approve Safer Schools and Communities Local Equipment and Technology Grant Award.

867
01:15:57,787 --> 01:15:58,448
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Cushing.

868
01:16:02,018 --> 01:16:03,019
[SPEAKER_04]: Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

869
01:16:03,179 --> 01:16:10,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Here this evening in place of Assistant Superintendent Christine Patterson, who wrote and applied for this grant.

870
01:16:10,524 --> 01:16:13,146
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a maximum award possibility of $80,000.

871
01:16:13,186 --> 01:16:15,948
[SPEAKER_04]: Medford Public Schools was awarded $38,502.

872
01:16:16,068 --> 01:16:20,671
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a competitive grant, therefore requires your approval.

873
01:16:21,231 --> 01:16:26,735
[SPEAKER_04]: The funds will be primarily used to update and modernize the district's communication systems.

874
01:16:27,590 --> 01:16:52,615
[SPEAKER_04]: specifically radio communication between buildings, having repeaters improved at the high school, as well as I believe in McGlynn, but then also a standard radio district-wide for the appropriate personnel to be able to use, and then easy communication, switching between channels for central office when situations arise, as well as connecting to the Medford Fire and Medford Police.

875
01:16:53,376 --> 01:16:54,316
[SPEAKER_17]: Very good, Mr. Cushing.

876
01:16:54,336 --> 01:16:54,956
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Aguero.

877
01:16:55,887 --> 01:17:00,032
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much for this report, and it's great that we're seeing the cash.

878
01:17:00,132 --> 01:17:06,560
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just curious, are we going to also be using this funding to improve the intercom system, or is that going to be?

879
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:09,804
[SPEAKER_04]: So that would be, that is not going to be part of this.

880
01:17:10,665 --> 01:17:14,350
[SPEAKER_04]: The radios do take up the overwhelming majority of these funds.

881
01:17:14,782 --> 01:17:20,564
[SPEAKER_05]: And so would teachers that are in the rooms that don't have intercom access, would they be given a radio, or?

882
01:17:20,984 --> 01:17:26,166
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but I know that Mr. McLaughlin is actually working right now on making sure that those things are remedied.

883
01:17:26,586 --> 01:17:42,732
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that Mr. DeLabor has worked extensively to identify the rooms that are lacking in the intercoms, and that he does have a plan in place that if there's a situation, to have those people notified, as was discussed recently.

884
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:43,720
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

885
01:17:44,120 --> 01:17:44,900
[SPEAKER_17]: Very good, thank you.

886
01:17:46,001 --> 01:17:46,801
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Russo.

887
01:17:47,381 --> 01:17:48,401
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, thank you very much.

888
01:17:48,481 --> 01:18:00,404
[SPEAKER_06]: I did talk to Assistant Superintendent Patterson, and I just wanted to, in case anybody watching is checking out the Safer Schools and Community Initiatives website.

889
01:18:01,485 --> 01:18:10,207
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the categories for which the money can be spent is for active shooter training, but I have received confirmation that that is not what we're using it for.

890
01:18:10,845 --> 01:18:16,473
[SPEAKER_06]: And if anybody's afterwards looking and going, wait a minute, there's no concern that that's what this is for.

891
01:18:18,055 --> 01:18:18,355
[SPEAKER_17]: Correct.

892
01:18:18,796 --> 01:18:19,116
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

893
01:18:20,740 --> 01:18:20,980
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

894
01:18:21,020 --> 01:18:21,420
[SPEAKER_09]: Van de Kloot.

895
01:18:22,180 --> 01:18:36,945
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to mention that I'm grateful that Assistant Superintendent Christine Patterson put in the grant for this, because this is money that certainly can be used and will be very practical.

896
01:18:37,345 --> 01:18:45,067
[SPEAKER_09]: So my thanks to her, and I'm glad we're going to be able to go forward with upgrading some of our equipment.

897
01:18:45,527 --> 01:18:45,907
[SPEAKER_09]: Very good.

898
01:18:46,248 --> 01:18:54,474
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like to also just make sure that we recognize Mr. McLaughlin for his work on this and to really make sure that he was part of this as well.

899
01:18:55,394 --> 01:18:55,574
[SPEAKER_24]: Ms.

900
01:18:55,634 --> 01:18:55,915
[SPEAKER_24]: Kurtz.

901
01:18:57,175 --> 01:19:01,439
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Mr. Cushing, and thank Christine Patterson and Mr. McLaughlin.

902
01:19:01,579 --> 01:19:02,559
[SPEAKER_24]: This is great news.

903
01:19:03,720 --> 01:19:12,827
[SPEAKER_24]: I just wanted to know, it says on the back, please note your official start date will be the date that your return contract is signed and dated and will terminate on December 31st.

904
01:19:13,742 --> 01:19:18,784
[SPEAKER_24]: Does that mean, like, do all the funds have to be spent by December 31st?

905
01:19:19,805 --> 01:19:26,668
[SPEAKER_24]: Or is it, you know, I guess you have to accept, sign the contract by, that was like on, I guess on the letter.

906
01:19:26,928 --> 01:19:29,449
[SPEAKER_04]: So I believe from the meetings that we've had that it's to accept.

907
01:19:30,109 --> 01:19:30,950
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to accept it.

908
01:19:31,030 --> 01:19:31,650
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to accept.

909
01:19:31,990 --> 01:19:42,915
[SPEAKER_04]: But I know that we are also moving forward, that we do have quotes in hand, and that the plan is to move forward to have this project done as quickly as possible.

910
01:19:43,595 --> 01:19:50,877
[SPEAKER_04]: So I wouldn't be surprised, given the speed that we're moving, to see this project well on its way by the first of the year.

911
01:19:51,597 --> 01:19:51,937
[SPEAKER_17]: Very good.

912
01:19:52,497 --> 01:19:53,217
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you very much.

913
01:19:53,237 --> 01:19:56,598
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there a motion for approval of this grant?

914
01:19:56,998 --> 01:19:58,798
[SPEAKER_17]: By Mr. Russo, seconded by Ms.

915
01:19:58,898 --> 01:19:59,218
[SPEAKER_17]: Kretz.

916
01:19:59,439 --> 01:20:00,179
[SPEAKER_17]: Roll call vote, please.

917
01:20:08,963 --> 01:20:11,364
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, 7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative, and the motion passes.

918
01:20:11,424 --> 01:20:11,764
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

919
01:20:11,804 --> 01:20:12,524
[SPEAKER_17]: Spend wisely.

920
01:20:14,284 --> 01:20:16,705
[SPEAKER_17]: Item 8, report on after-school program.

921
01:20:17,005 --> 01:20:17,205
[SPEAKER_17]: Ms.

922
01:20:17,245 --> 01:20:17,845
[SPEAKER_17]: Fidler-Curry?

923
01:20:19,026 --> 01:20:19,506
[SPEAKER_17]: Hello.

924
01:20:19,706 --> 01:20:20,086
[SPEAKER_17]: How are you?

925
01:20:20,386 --> 01:20:21,266
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm doing well, thank you.

926
01:20:21,286 --> 01:20:21,666
[SPEAKER_07]: How are you?

927
01:20:21,746 --> 01:20:23,647
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much for the opportunity.

928
01:20:25,407 --> 01:20:26,968
[SPEAKER_07]: So you all have my report.

929
01:20:27,408 --> 01:20:28,728
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope you had a chance to read it.

930
01:20:29,148 --> 01:20:34,750
[SPEAKER_07]: I first wanted to say, in the after-school programs, we've been spending a lot of time this month, obviously, thinking about gratitude.

931
01:20:35,918 --> 01:20:42,002
[SPEAKER_07]: So everywhere, you know, in all the different classes with all the different groups, we're thinking about what that word means and the different things we're grateful for.

932
01:20:42,542 --> 01:20:48,206
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm really excited to have a really public opportunity to say, voice what I'm grateful for.

933
01:20:48,326 --> 01:20:50,947
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's, of course, my wonderful staff.

934
01:20:51,688 --> 01:20:55,250
[SPEAKER_07]: We have representatives, support and representatives here today.

935
01:20:56,251 --> 01:20:58,252
[SPEAKER_07]: Our families that we work with, the kids, of course.

936
01:20:58,512 --> 01:21:03,355
[SPEAKER_07]: And now that it's my second year, I feel a little more comfortable figuring out who's who.

937
01:21:03,874 --> 01:21:13,816
[SPEAKER_07]: So I've had some excellent conversations and support with the director of special ed, and of course my go-to, the associate superintendent, Diane Caldwell.

938
01:21:14,156 --> 01:21:21,577
[SPEAKER_07]: I've worked with the Medford Police Department this year, Rachel Perry from the Phys Ed Department.

939
01:21:21,637 --> 01:21:26,558
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're really getting a bunch of the systems together, and the communication is getting a lot better.

940
01:21:26,598 --> 01:21:28,959
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just want to say how grateful I am for that this year.

941
01:21:28,999 --> 01:21:30,559
[SPEAKER_07]: It's made a big difference.

942
01:21:32,350 --> 01:21:36,435
[SPEAKER_07]: But you saw from the report, it hasn't made all the difference.

943
01:21:36,495 --> 01:21:39,439
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not where we'd all like us to be.

944
01:21:39,999 --> 01:21:43,284
[SPEAKER_07]: Staffing continues to be just an unbelievable struggle.

945
01:21:44,625 --> 01:21:48,150
[SPEAKER_07]: And just like it was last year, I would say maybe even more so this year.

946
01:21:49,331 --> 01:21:51,212
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a problem that's not unique to Medford.

947
01:21:51,832 --> 01:22:05,456
[SPEAKER_07]: I continue to sit, I'm now co-chair of the network of extended day directors and I just had a meeting last Friday and every one of us was going around, around, around talking about wait lists, talking about our challenges with staffing.

948
01:22:06,896 --> 01:22:13,638
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's not only recruiting and attracting staff to interview, it's keeping staff, I mean I think

949
01:22:14,459 --> 01:22:17,540
[SPEAKER_07]: It has to, what we talked about is it has to do with this good economy.

950
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:19,360
[SPEAKER_07]: There are so many other options for people.

951
01:22:19,580 --> 01:22:32,003
[SPEAKER_07]: But then I found that that's a double-edged sword because that means our families need us even more because, you know, both parents might be working, so now they need childcare even more so, which, anyway, I'm not going to complain.

952
01:22:32,043 --> 01:22:36,304
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to stick to gratitude and talk about all of the positives that we have.

953
01:22:38,077 --> 01:22:41,619
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, like the staff that we have, everybody is stretched thin.

954
01:22:41,799 --> 01:22:55,985
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, just like teachers, so we're all educators, and in the same way that our teachers and guidance staff and everybody who works in our school department from, you know, all of us wear more hats than we signed on to wear, my staff is doing exactly that.

955
01:22:56,145 --> 01:23:02,968
[SPEAKER_07]: People who gave me two days when they applied are now working three and four because they know how badly we need it.

956
01:23:04,770 --> 01:23:10,534
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm very grateful but you know I'm working every day to try and figure out how we can figure that out.

957
01:23:10,815 --> 01:23:15,058
[SPEAKER_07]: So the good news is we've we've been able to add a few more students.

958
01:23:15,118 --> 01:23:22,103
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not I'm trying to think about how to to I'm not as much of a data person as I'd like to be.

959
01:23:22,143 --> 01:23:27,487
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm working on getting there but I'm trying to figure out how to present it in a way that talks about full time spots.

960
01:23:28,288 --> 01:23:32,251
[SPEAKER_07]: So like a five day a week is one spot but that might

961
01:23:32,577 --> 01:23:37,618
[SPEAKER_07]: That spot might accommodate two children depending on the needs of families if there's somebody who comes two days a week or three days a week.

962
01:23:38,059 --> 01:23:45,281
[SPEAKER_07]: So luckily we've been able to accommodate more children this year without creating more spots because we don't have enough staff to create more spots.

963
01:23:46,981 --> 01:23:53,123
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's good news that we can help more families but but we're at the same place.

964
01:23:54,494 --> 01:23:58,178
[SPEAKER_07]: So I hope you had a chance to read the little italics about our waitlist.

965
01:23:58,959 --> 01:24:01,002
[SPEAKER_07]: So the waitlist does seem alarmingly huge.

966
01:24:01,883 --> 01:24:05,567
[SPEAKER_07]: The total is 70 students still on a waitlist across the district.

967
01:24:06,008 --> 01:24:07,810
[SPEAKER_07]: But please know that that's not.

968
01:24:08,509 --> 01:24:10,290
[SPEAKER_07]: 70 students who have been waiting since April.

969
01:24:10,450 --> 01:24:11,891
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a very dynamic list.

970
01:24:11,991 --> 01:24:17,975
[SPEAKER_07]: It's constantly changing with, you know, as we can place students on or people find other things.

971
01:24:18,035 --> 01:24:21,957
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, I just added someone yesterday and I just took someone else off the list today.

972
01:24:22,117 --> 01:24:25,699
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's a moving number.

973
01:24:25,879 --> 01:24:29,661
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not 70 families who have been, you know, wondering what they're going to do.

974
01:24:32,730 --> 01:24:34,651
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I guess there's nothing.

975
01:24:36,012 --> 01:24:37,413
[SPEAKER_17]: Can I ask just a quick question?

976
01:24:37,433 --> 01:24:40,875
[SPEAKER_17]: Do families notify you if they find an alternate location?

977
01:24:40,955 --> 01:24:42,396
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't always notify me.

978
01:24:42,496 --> 01:24:45,558
[SPEAKER_07]: So I do reach out at the beginning of every month.

979
01:24:45,658 --> 01:24:49,300
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been trying to reach out mostly just so for our own data and information.

980
01:24:49,380 --> 01:24:54,243
[SPEAKER_07]: I reach out to families even when I don't have a spot to say just in the interest of keeping our records accurate.

981
01:24:54,684 --> 01:24:55,825
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you still interested in the spot?

982
01:24:55,885 --> 01:24:57,525
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I've gotten some updates that way.

983
01:24:59,286 --> 01:25:01,487
[SPEAKER_07]: Usually they say, yes, please keep me on the list.

984
01:25:01,547 --> 01:25:02,748
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm still interested in the spot.

985
01:25:03,148 --> 01:25:09,191
[SPEAKER_07]: Even when they've found alternative programs, they'd rather be in the schools.

986
01:25:09,791 --> 01:25:10,171
[SPEAKER_17]: Very good.

987
01:25:10,211 --> 01:25:10,971
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Russo.

988
01:25:11,872 --> 01:25:12,292
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

989
01:25:12,532 --> 01:25:19,495
[SPEAKER_06]: I really appreciate this, without having to even ask for it, because you know I was going to.

990
01:25:20,136 --> 01:25:22,477
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the things about the wait lists, though, that I've heard

991
01:25:24,103 --> 01:25:38,898
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was just trying to brainstorm around how we can, um, so when, when people find out there's a big wait list, for instance, at the Brooks, um, it's fairly well accepted that you can fill out this paperwork, but you're never getting a spot.

992
01:25:40,079 --> 01:25:44,604
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and that may or may not be actual true, but that seems to be the, um,

993
01:25:45,512 --> 01:25:46,032
[SPEAKER_06]: the belief.

994
01:25:47,553 --> 01:26:01,157
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, you know, one of my problems with the wait list numbers is people who don't fill out the paperwork to join a wait list that you'll never get through, that doesn't give us any sense of the real need.

995
01:26:02,418 --> 01:26:14,982
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, I mean, we can do this in subcommittee, of course, but I mean, I think there are ways to, you know, keep how big the wait lists are secret, making people fill out these forms, so we can get a real sense as a committee

996
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:21,866
[SPEAKER_06]: Is the wait list 70, understanding the dynamic you just explained, or is it really 350?

997
01:26:23,708 --> 01:26:27,892
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we can't ever budget and plan long term without knowing.

998
01:26:28,807 --> 01:26:36,871
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, because planning for an additional 70 is really a very different activity than planning for the need to build a building to house that many more people.

999
01:26:37,451 --> 01:26:44,795
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think it would be good to try and find a way to shut down this.

1000
01:26:45,435 --> 01:26:49,077
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to fill all that paperwork just to find, because I know I'm not going to get a spot.

1001
01:26:49,117 --> 01:26:54,159
[SPEAKER_06]: Because without that paperwork, we're never going to be able to understand the size of the problem.

1002
01:26:58,654 --> 01:26:59,954
[SPEAKER_06]: A question about your before school.

1003
01:26:59,974 --> 01:27:04,896
[SPEAKER_06]: You said when possible students are given a choice between quiet play or gym time.

1004
01:27:05,016 --> 01:27:06,076
[SPEAKER_06]: What does that mean.

1005
01:27:06,356 --> 01:27:15,099
[SPEAKER_07]: That just means if our if our program is too small and like at the at the McGlynn it's a very small but it's the smallest program.

1006
01:27:15,619 --> 01:27:18,680
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually McGlynn and and Columbus are pretty equal right.

1007
01:27:21,381 --> 01:27:25,502
[SPEAKER_07]: They they don't like if we have the two teachers it depends where the space is.

1008
01:27:25,887 --> 01:27:34,090
[SPEAKER_07]: So at the Columbus we can have half the students go in the gym and half stay in the Italian room is where they use it and do quiet time activities.

1009
01:27:34,231 --> 01:27:38,992
[SPEAKER_07]: And we have our two teachers that are close by but we don't want to split them in different parts of the building.

1010
01:27:39,053 --> 01:27:45,575
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think it's when you know where the teachers sit because they need to be close to each other to help each other out.

1011
01:27:45,695 --> 01:27:50,677
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have to at least two with every group and a group as you know is 26 students.

1012
01:27:50,697 --> 01:27:54,019
[SPEAKER_07]: We keep our ratios by the state recommendations or which are 1 to 13.

1013
01:27:54,990 --> 01:28:06,873
[SPEAKER_07]: I talked a lot last year about the ratios we like to keep it 1 to 10 because you know in after school we have fewer outside support like it during a school day.

1014
01:28:07,233 --> 01:28:10,534
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got loads of different loads of other adults in the building that can help you.

1015
01:28:10,714 --> 01:28:15,435
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't have as many adults in the building to help us in the after school so we keep our ratios even smaller 1 to 10.

1016
01:28:15,895 --> 01:28:18,235
[SPEAKER_07]: But the recommendation by the state is 1 to 13.

1017
01:28:18,876 --> 01:28:21,156
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's what we use for all of our programs.

1018
01:28:21,416 --> 01:28:23,297
[SPEAKER_07]: So if we'd like to have at least two adults.

1019
01:28:24,357 --> 01:28:24,577
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1020
01:28:25,453 --> 01:28:25,773
[SPEAKER_17]: Very good.

1021
01:28:26,033 --> 01:28:26,373
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1022
01:28:27,133 --> 01:28:27,354
[SPEAKER_17]: Ms.

1023
01:28:27,394 --> 01:28:27,694
[SPEAKER_17]: Kurtz.

1024
01:28:28,734 --> 01:28:28,834
[SPEAKER_24]: Hi.

1025
01:28:29,154 --> 01:28:30,334
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you very much for the report.

1026
01:28:31,194 --> 01:28:38,316
[SPEAKER_24]: And I had an opportunity to go to the Brooks Elementary and volunteer at the after school program a couple weeks ago.

1027
01:28:38,836 --> 01:28:39,997
[SPEAKER_24]: And I had a great time.

1028
01:28:40,497 --> 01:28:44,618
[SPEAKER_24]: And I was really impressed with how well the program, it's so well structured.

1029
01:28:45,426 --> 01:28:46,928
[SPEAKER_24]: organized and very safe.

1030
01:28:47,869 --> 01:28:51,415
[SPEAKER_24]: There was a teacher aide, has a walkie talkie.

1031
01:28:51,615 --> 01:28:53,117
[SPEAKER_24]: The teacher has a walkie talkie.

1032
01:28:53,598 --> 01:28:55,241
[SPEAKER_24]: Everybody's communicating via walkie.

1033
01:28:55,321 --> 01:28:58,125
[SPEAKER_24]: It was so, it was like really incredible to participate in.

1034
01:28:59,267 --> 01:28:59,948
[SPEAKER_24]: And I got to

1035
01:29:00,708 --> 01:29:05,350
[SPEAKER_24]: go to the outside activity time, homework time, story time, we did some arts and crafts.

1036
01:29:06,030 --> 01:29:08,251
[SPEAKER_24]: It was just a wonderful, you know, I had a wonderful experience.

1037
01:29:08,971 --> 01:29:21,696
[SPEAKER_24]: The only concern I had is, you know, I know there's a wait list, and the concern I have is, you know, if we were to fill those spots, like let's say overnight we filled, we got five new teachers, where would those students go?

1038
01:29:21,716 --> 01:29:26,478
[SPEAKER_24]: That's something that I observed was that there's a lack of space.

1039
01:29:26,878 --> 01:29:28,540
[SPEAKER_24]: for the after school program.

1040
01:29:28,580 --> 01:29:30,902
[SPEAKER_24]: So like they don't have access to the whole school.

1041
01:29:31,662 --> 01:29:34,425
[SPEAKER_24]: So there's limited classrooms that they can go to.

1042
01:29:34,865 --> 01:29:39,409
[SPEAKER_24]: So I'm looking at the wait list and I don't know where those students would go.

1043
01:29:39,449 --> 01:29:45,134
[SPEAKER_24]: Like if we could put them in tomorrow, I don't know where those books, you know, where the 35 students would go.

1044
01:29:45,154 --> 01:29:49,038
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean if we got five teachers and, you know, everybody's going to be in a classroom.

1045
01:29:49,638 --> 01:29:51,558
[SPEAKER_24]: Where would they go?

1046
01:29:51,578 --> 01:29:57,099
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm just thinking, is there a plan to increase the space?

1047
01:29:58,260 --> 01:30:02,620
[SPEAKER_24]: Even one of the teachers I was talking to said, maybe a mobile classroom.

1048
01:30:03,141 --> 01:30:11,822
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, I don't know if that's an idea because it would be a little bit chaotic in the gym with everybody in the gym.

1049
01:30:11,842 --> 01:30:14,243
[SPEAKER_24]: And there was just those little setups.

1050
01:30:14,283 --> 01:30:16,303
[SPEAKER_24]: I know I've seen them sometimes in CCD class where they

1051
01:30:16,663 --> 01:30:27,434
[SPEAKER_24]: can have the dividers, but I'm just curious, is anybody looking into a plan for spacing, because the numbers are growing dramatically, for the Brooks especially.

1052
01:30:27,694 --> 01:30:27,974
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah.

1053
01:30:28,395 --> 01:30:29,876
[SPEAKER_14]: Obviously, this is a discussion we've had.

1054
01:30:30,156 --> 01:30:30,857
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I know.

1055
01:30:31,197 --> 01:30:32,499
[SPEAKER_14]: We have had this discussion.

1056
01:30:32,779 --> 01:30:34,801
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you build us another school?

1057
01:30:35,882 --> 01:30:37,724
[SPEAKER_14]: It is difficult, and space is difficult.

1058
01:30:37,764 --> 01:30:40,686
[SPEAKER_14]: And of course, the principals have always been very good.

1059
01:30:41,447 --> 01:30:44,148
[SPEAKER_14]: in helping us out, and Suzanne is great.

1060
01:30:44,248 --> 01:30:47,289
[SPEAKER_07]: I meant to actually list them on my gratitude list, the principals.

1061
01:30:47,469 --> 01:30:48,310
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, they're great.

1062
01:30:48,370 --> 01:30:51,891
[SPEAKER_14]: And while we're doing gratitude, this one here gets a lot of gratitude from me.

1063
01:30:51,951 --> 01:30:57,013
[SPEAKER_14]: I value her as much as anybody, because she's in the classrooms.

1064
01:30:57,673 --> 01:31:02,815
[SPEAKER_14]: Right before she's running into my office, she says, I have to go be psych coordinated today, or I have to be the group leader.

1065
01:31:02,855 --> 01:31:04,516
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you for what you do.

1066
01:31:05,836 --> 01:31:08,176
[SPEAKER_14]: So yes, space is a problem.

1067
01:31:08,196 --> 01:31:10,337
[SPEAKER_14]: There are classrooms that we can use.

1068
01:31:10,437 --> 01:31:17,078
[SPEAKER_14]: We just have to do, we have to look at the kids and, you know, parsing them out to grade one, grade two.

1069
01:31:17,138 --> 01:31:18,619
[SPEAKER_14]: Sometimes we have K1s, K2.

1070
01:31:19,859 --> 01:31:25,140
[SPEAKER_14]: I know that Dale Siavadi is here, and she's been with the after school program at the Brooks for many, many years.

1071
01:31:25,240 --> 01:31:31,081
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think the first thing we have to do is solve the, you know, trying to get more personnel in.

1072
01:31:31,141 --> 01:31:34,142
[SPEAKER_14]: Because once we can do that, then we'll figure out the space piece.

1073
01:31:36,662 --> 01:31:41,144
[SPEAKER_24]: And I just, I know there's a lot of high school students that, you know, that would be interested.

1074
01:31:41,564 --> 01:31:47,886
[SPEAKER_24]: And I just happen to know that the pay that they're, you know, that they're paid is lower than the minimum wage.

1075
01:31:48,206 --> 01:31:52,267
[SPEAKER_24]: And, you know, I think that maybe if we, we could attract more high school students.

1076
01:31:54,935 --> 01:31:56,736
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, okay, so maybe it is minimum wage.

1077
01:31:56,896 --> 01:31:59,698
[SPEAKER_24]: No, I thought, I was told that it was 11.

1078
01:32:00,098 --> 01:32:04,741
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's my understanding we are going to go to minimum wage if we haven't done that already.

1079
01:32:04,761 --> 01:32:12,165
[SPEAKER_24]: Or maybe, maybe, was it higher than, like was it maybe more than minimum wage and maybe did the rate go down?

1080
01:32:13,063 --> 01:32:15,104
[SPEAKER_17]: Minimum wage is going to 13 in January.

1081
01:32:15,144 --> 01:32:18,225
[SPEAKER_17]: So if they are not there, you have to comply by January.

1082
01:32:18,305 --> 01:32:19,005
[SPEAKER_24]: By January.

1083
01:32:19,425 --> 01:32:22,886
[SPEAKER_24]: So even these high school students will be going up.

1084
01:32:23,166 --> 01:32:24,707
[SPEAKER_24]: So that might just be some confusion.

1085
01:32:24,727 --> 01:32:31,969
[SPEAKER_24]: But there was another concern that was brought up that the high school students can only work until 530 instead of the 6 o'clock hour.

1086
01:32:32,029 --> 01:32:36,211
[SPEAKER_24]: And I just didn't know if there was a reason why, like a rule that we have to follow.

1087
01:32:36,811 --> 01:32:46,134
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a leadership choice that I made because by 530 we we don't need as many staff members because most people there's so much so many kids have been picked up.

1088
01:32:46,574 --> 01:32:51,455
[SPEAKER_07]: So that was the mom in me that came and said that's an easy way to save the program.

1089
01:32:51,595 --> 01:32:52,535
[SPEAKER_07]: You know a couple of dollars.

1090
01:32:52,975 --> 01:32:58,817
[SPEAKER_07]: But also make sure that students get home in time to get homework and dinner and family time in because they come to us right after school.

1091
01:32:59,436 --> 01:33:00,897
[SPEAKER_07]: and they still have to get their homework done.

1092
01:33:01,178 --> 01:33:06,422
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, you know, when I interview the students, I make a big deal to say, you're a high school student first.

1093
01:33:07,142 --> 01:33:14,148
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's what's great about this job, is that I'm going to recognize you as a high school student first, not part of my bottom line first.

1094
01:33:14,929 --> 01:33:23,796
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what makes this job stand out from, you know, a Wegmans or a different job that a high school student might get, is, you know, we're looking out for your grades first.

1095
01:33:24,056 --> 01:33:27,138
[SPEAKER_07]: But, so that was the 530 reason.

1096
01:33:28,078 --> 01:33:28,338
[SPEAKER_24]: OK.

1097
01:33:28,539 --> 01:33:28,759
[SPEAKER_24]: OK.

1098
01:33:28,859 --> 01:33:29,219
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1099
01:33:29,240 --> 01:33:34,646
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm delighted and that was one of the things I wanted to say that we do have a total this year of 27 high school students that work with us.

1100
01:33:35,287 --> 01:33:47,682
[SPEAKER_07]: So you know either for a couple of days on it depending on the sports seasons of course because again they're a high school student first and I want them to have the complete as a mom and as somebody who loved high school have the complete high school experience.

1101
01:33:48,117 --> 01:33:52,459
[SPEAKER_07]: But definitely start building your resume, start building your professional network, and start saving some money.

1102
01:33:52,619 --> 01:33:53,840
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm happy to be able to do that.

1103
01:33:53,860 --> 01:33:54,360
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Giro.

1104
01:33:54,700 --> 01:33:55,941
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much for the report.

1105
01:33:56,561 --> 01:34:00,423
[SPEAKER_05]: So first, how many open staffing positions do we have currently?

1106
01:34:00,983 --> 01:34:00,423
150.

1107
01:34:01,203 --> 01:34:06,225
[SPEAKER_07]: For this section right here.

1108
01:34:06,685 --> 01:34:10,287
[SPEAKER_07]: I knew that question was coming, and I was trying to calculate how to answer it.

1109
01:34:10,887 --> 01:34:15,930
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's no good way to answer it, because I would have to have more information.

1110
01:34:15,970 --> 01:34:16,630
[SPEAKER_07]: I would have to know.

1111
01:34:17,415 --> 01:34:21,459
[SPEAKER_07]: What's the competency and experience of the staff member that we're talking about?

1112
01:34:22,059 --> 01:34:26,163
[SPEAKER_07]: And what are the needs of the 13 students that that staff member will be?

1113
01:34:26,623 --> 01:34:33,510
[SPEAKER_07]: Because we've got, you know, we're a public school, so we take the children from the public schools that come with a variety of different needs.

1114
01:34:33,910 --> 01:34:43,859
[SPEAKER_07]: Plus, it's the end of the day, so some of those needs, you know, whether documented needs or just fatigue needs are elevated in the after school.

1115
01:34:44,384 --> 01:34:51,132
[SPEAKER_07]: So sometimes there are students that require more than the 1 to 13 ratio that we've got in place.

1116
01:34:51,473 --> 01:34:57,700
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you ask me how many I need, it's not off to say so many more than you'd see on paper.

1117
01:34:58,040 --> 01:34:59,082
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not just 70 divided by 13?

1118
01:34:59,142 --> 01:34:59,522
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely not.

1119
01:35:01,404 --> 01:35:09,411
[SPEAKER_07]: And I could pick out some of my staff that I could say, if I had 20 Alexas, then I can tell you exactly how many I need.

1120
01:35:09,852 --> 01:35:14,836
[SPEAKER_07]: But there are the staff who just don't have the drive, passion, or experience, or whatever.

1121
01:35:16,057 --> 01:35:20,181
[SPEAKER_07]: Loads of them are very reliable, but they don't necessarily have the behavior management that we need.

1122
01:35:20,721 --> 01:35:25,085
[SPEAKER_07]: Or some of them are excellent and have the behavioral management, but they've got other things going on in their life.

1123
01:35:25,145 --> 01:35:28,028
[SPEAKER_07]: So they end up calling out sick a lot, or calling out

1124
01:35:29,025 --> 01:35:36,190
[SPEAKER_14]: And sometimes we get college students, which are great, but then they change the semester, so their schedule changes, so then we're down again.

1125
01:35:36,490 --> 01:35:36,690
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

1126
01:35:37,211 --> 01:35:43,855
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, I wanted to be really transparent and have that answer, but there's just no honest way to answer that question.

1127
01:35:43,875 --> 01:35:45,636
[SPEAKER_05]: So if someone comes, they get a job?

1128
01:35:45,696 --> 01:35:48,198
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that how it's—if they pass all the Cori checks?

1129
01:35:48,770 --> 01:35:50,290
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, we look at their competency.

1130
01:35:50,450 --> 01:35:54,011
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't just hire anybody who's breathing and coming in through the doors.

1131
01:35:54,332 --> 01:36:07,415
[SPEAKER_07]: But we have definitely taken people that, you know, in an ideal world we might not have taken because we do have enough competent people that we can team them up with to say, you know, we know you're going to be kind to the kids.

1132
01:36:07,495 --> 01:36:10,136
[SPEAKER_07]: And so the most important thing

1133
01:36:11,125 --> 01:36:12,685
[SPEAKER_07]: about for after school is safety.

1134
01:36:12,846 --> 01:36:15,046
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the number one priority, right?

1135
01:36:15,146 --> 01:36:19,407
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the number two for me is relationships and social emotional well-being.

1136
01:36:19,748 --> 01:36:21,348
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the number two for parents is homework.

1137
01:36:21,828 --> 01:36:22,368
[SPEAKER_07]: I've looked into that.

1138
01:36:22,388 --> 01:36:26,209
[SPEAKER_07]: Number one is safety for parents and number two is homework, but relationships is the big one.

1139
01:36:26,249 --> 01:36:34,992
[SPEAKER_07]: So if somebody comes in and they're not great behavior management and they're not great, they don't have a huge background in education, but they're great with kids, then they could still

1140
01:36:35,752 --> 01:36:40,499
[SPEAKER_05]: So in terms of volunteers, because I noticed on the back page it talked about middle school volunteers and such.

1141
01:36:40,939 --> 01:36:47,288
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you talked to any people in the senior center or any seniors to come down or perhaps we could do a tax deferment program?

1142
01:36:47,528 --> 01:36:50,312
[SPEAKER_07]: I interviewed two people from the tax deferment program.

1143
01:36:50,332 --> 01:36:51,533
[SPEAKER_07]: I reached out to that office.

1144
01:36:52,694 --> 01:36:54,256
[SPEAKER_07]: And one was, one was great.

1145
01:36:54,316 --> 01:36:55,476
[SPEAKER_07]: She was, she was signed up.

1146
01:36:55,536 --> 01:37:00,480
[SPEAKER_07]: She was actually going to work with us, work for, but then she stopped and said, you know what, I retired for a reason.

1147
01:37:00,520 --> 01:37:01,301
[SPEAKER_07]: I've changed my mind.

1148
01:37:01,361 --> 01:37:03,342
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not, I'm not going to take this job.

1149
01:37:03,842 --> 01:37:10,847
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have, I have asked them, I asked if we could be the site for the tax deferment and she couldn't find anybody that wanted to come.

1150
01:37:11,288 --> 01:37:16,331
[SPEAKER_05]: So are parents, are parents asked to be volunteers as well?

1151
01:37:18,673 --> 01:37:19,153
[SPEAKER_14]: It's tricky.

1152
01:37:20,748 --> 01:37:28,616
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, I would imagine, so let's say, for example, you are one of these parents that's on a waiting list right now, and so you have to do the calculation.

1153
01:37:28,656 --> 01:37:34,401
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone says, well, you come in one day a week, and that'll cover your waiting list spot.

1154
01:37:35,142 --> 01:37:41,648
[SPEAKER_05]: That seems like a reasonable request, or we could say the certain ratio of so many days volunteering guarantees a position.

1155
01:37:41,668 --> 01:37:42,729
[SPEAKER_14]: To make it more of like a co-op thing?

1156
01:37:42,989 --> 01:37:43,170
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1157
01:37:43,890 --> 01:37:46,030
[SPEAKER_14]: At one point, we did try something like that.

1158
01:37:46,110 --> 01:37:50,971
[SPEAKER_14]: Then we found that sometimes parents would begin with us and say, yeah, sure, I'll do that.

1159
01:37:51,431 --> 01:37:57,312
[SPEAKER_14]: Then the children move into the program, and then all of a sudden they can't be the person that we want them to be.

1160
01:37:58,173 --> 01:38:01,693
[SPEAKER_14]: But we wouldn't tell the child that they can't leave the program.

1161
01:38:01,753 --> 01:38:03,794
[SPEAKER_14]: So it doesn't always work to our benefit.

1162
01:38:04,474 --> 01:38:08,074
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, I understand that this idea that co-op might not work, but it'd be interesting.

1163
01:38:08,094 --> 01:38:11,555
[SPEAKER_05]: When was the last time a letter was sent to parents saying that there's a need?

1164
01:38:12,335 --> 01:38:18,438
[SPEAKER_05]: If you do happen to have a couple of days that are free, it'd be great if you could help out with the program.

1165
01:38:18,458 --> 01:38:21,139
[SPEAKER_05]: Has any of the outreach been done to the PTOs or to the parents?

1166
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:34,506
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I've sent, in my correspondence to our families, our after-school families, I've let them know that we're hiring, and if they've got anybody that they could recommend it to, I've done that, sort of in that way.

1167
01:38:34,546 --> 01:38:37,227
[SPEAKER_05]: It might surprise you if it perhaps, I mean, make a suggestion.

1168
01:38:37,287 --> 01:38:39,068
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to criticize the program.

1169
01:38:39,088 --> 01:38:41,549
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you do a lot of good work, but perhaps it would be helpful.

1170
01:38:42,129 --> 01:38:58,077
[SPEAKER_05]: to let parents know that if they could put in a little bit more time, especially to the PTOs, if you happen to have one or two evenings a week free, it would be helpful, and then we could start servicing more children, not perhaps with a promise, but just letting people know, you know, if we get more help, we're going to get more help.

1171
01:38:58,617 --> 01:39:08,182
[SPEAKER_05]: The second line of questioning I had to do with the paragraph that talked about tuition, are there any children who are, cannot receive,

1172
01:39:09,911 --> 01:39:11,735
[SPEAKER_05]: They can't be a part of the program because they don't have the money.

1173
01:39:12,136 --> 01:39:13,440
[SPEAKER_07]: Not that we've experienced.

1174
01:39:14,001 --> 01:39:17,771
[SPEAKER_07]: We haven't had any families come to us saying, I just can't afford it anymore.

1175
01:39:18,479 --> 01:39:33,089
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, because I guess I'm referring to, unfortunately we know that there's a wait list for vouchers at the state level for parents that qualify, and new state regulations have made the staff requirements reporting process extremely cumbersome.

1176
01:39:33,590 --> 01:39:34,870
[SPEAKER_05]: Could you speak to that a little bit?

1177
01:39:34,950 --> 01:39:46,458
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it really does sound like there are parents that are trying to participate in the program, waited a long time to be, and then they just sort of got bumped because they couldn't, the state voucher system changed.

1178
01:39:46,658 --> 01:39:47,279
[SPEAKER_05]: Has that happened?

1179
01:39:48,049 --> 01:39:51,391
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I know that Voucher actually did let a lot of people back on.

1180
01:39:51,772 --> 01:39:54,833
[SPEAKER_07]: They put a big dent in their own wait lists.

1181
01:39:54,933 --> 01:39:56,514
[SPEAKER_07]: They did open it up to a lot of people.

1182
01:39:56,614 --> 01:40:00,377
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is, my paragraph's actually a little bit outdated.

1183
01:40:01,277 --> 01:40:05,960
[SPEAKER_07]: That just happened, I learned that at NEDS, at the Network of Extended Day.

1184
01:40:07,021 --> 01:40:14,746
[SPEAKER_07]: We continue to, we have 14 families on vouchers in our program, and we haven't had any more come to us with vouchers.

1185
01:40:15,206 --> 01:40:16,927
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't

1186
01:40:17,389 --> 01:40:24,194
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if there's a way that I can find out how many Medford families are on the voucher wait list because it's confidential.

1187
01:40:25,523 --> 01:40:27,024
[SPEAKER_07]: They wouldn't have to tell me any specifics.

1188
01:40:27,084 --> 01:40:38,651
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder if I could call... It's possible you could just hand them a mailer and say, could you please send this to people on the list, letting them know that... Because I guess my concern with the program is threefold.

1189
01:40:38,811 --> 01:40:40,873
[SPEAKER_05]: First, I want to echo what Member Rousseau said.

1190
01:40:40,913 --> 01:40:46,977
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, talking to many parents, they just don't bother applying because why climb a mountain that you're not even going to be able to get to the top of?

1191
01:40:47,697 --> 01:40:49,599
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's that issue.

1192
01:40:49,639 --> 01:40:54,742
[SPEAKER_05]: And parents that would like to participate in the program, they find themselves just finding other options.

1193
01:40:54,962 --> 01:40:58,245
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not worth the hassle and maybe the issues.

1194
01:40:59,566 --> 01:41:07,291
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm also worried that there are families that need this support, and we're not getting it.

1195
01:41:07,451 --> 01:41:10,754
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I guess they come in two flavors.

1196
01:41:11,334 --> 01:41:13,316
[SPEAKER_05]: After school, you have students that are there

1197
01:41:13,916 --> 01:41:16,417
[SPEAKER_05]: that their parents want them to participate and they need a little help.

1198
01:41:16,477 --> 01:41:21,878
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there's parents that kind of need their kids to be there for them to work that second job to put bread on the table.

1199
01:41:22,459 --> 01:41:24,879
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just want to make sure that we're reaching out to those families.

1200
01:41:27,780 --> 01:41:28,541
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1201
01:41:29,061 --> 01:41:38,223
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll see if I can find out from Child Care Choices, that's our voucher partner, to see if they can tell me how many Medford families are on the wait list.

1202
01:41:38,304 --> 01:41:42,965
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that'll give us a much better sense of if there are families in need that we don't even know exist.

1203
01:41:43,245 --> 01:41:43,365
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

1204
01:41:43,405 --> 01:41:48,931
[SPEAKER_05]: And I understand that there might be information that you're not privy to but I mean I just say look I'll make you a Xerox.

1205
01:41:49,131 --> 01:41:58,801
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's a bunch of pages handed out to your members because I mean it seems like you know my family we also use after school services but we can find options.

1206
01:41:58,841 --> 01:42:01,804
[SPEAKER_05]: There are other families that you know single moms that just don't have that option.

1207
01:42:01,884 --> 01:42:02,024
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.

1208
01:42:03,606 --> 01:42:03,966
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1209
01:42:04,767 --> 01:42:05,368
[SPEAKER_17]: Miss Mustone.

1210
01:42:07,049 --> 01:42:09,830
[SPEAKER_19]: Megan, you probably want to sit down after all these questions.

1211
01:42:09,850 --> 01:42:10,710
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, that's all right.

1212
01:42:11,710 --> 01:42:21,972
[SPEAKER_19]: The process to apply, I know that, I guess, a year and a half ago, people showed up at the office and waited and see if you were lucky enough to be first in line.

1213
01:42:22,352 --> 01:42:25,053
[SPEAKER_19]: How did it go this past sign up?

1214
01:42:25,293 --> 01:42:25,693
[SPEAKER_07]: That was it.

1215
01:42:25,773 --> 01:42:28,013
[SPEAKER_07]: No, so April 1 is the sign up for the next year.

1216
01:42:28,033 --> 01:42:29,594
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, so this is the first time to try.

1217
01:42:29,634 --> 01:42:30,994
[SPEAKER_19]: So what is the plan for the new system?

1218
01:42:31,014 --> 01:42:35,235
[SPEAKER_07]: So the plan is so far, and I have to work with the principals on this one,

1219
01:42:35,565 --> 01:42:38,026
[SPEAKER_07]: We are having the sign ups at the individual schools.

1220
01:42:38,227 --> 01:42:38,507
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

1221
01:42:38,827 --> 01:42:43,510
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think they'll be on different days so that I can be present at them and answer questions.

1222
01:42:44,830 --> 01:42:48,773
[SPEAKER_07]: Dale doesn't know this yet but I'm going to try and get our site coordinators to go to those sign ups.

1223
01:42:48,953 --> 01:42:49,213
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

1224
01:42:49,233 --> 01:42:58,158
[SPEAKER_07]: So actually I mentioned that we had that at our leadership meeting because the site coordinator has the most answers about the program for the families when they sign up.

1225
01:42:58,278 --> 01:43:01,020
[SPEAKER_07]: And that way first of all I said number two is relationships.

1226
01:43:01,080 --> 01:43:01,960
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the important part.

1227
01:43:02,340 --> 01:43:03,141
[SPEAKER_07]: So when you're in this.

1228
01:43:04,045 --> 01:43:12,227
[SPEAKER_07]: six o'clock in the morning line to the office at the high school that has nothing to do with where your kids are, the people that are gonna be working with your kids, there's no relationship building happening there.

1229
01:43:12,707 --> 01:43:18,569
[SPEAKER_07]: Where I feel like if the families are going to the school where this program is happening and meeting staff from the program.

1230
01:43:19,669 --> 01:43:24,471
[SPEAKER_19]: It will still be the first come first serve, like who's ever sleeps over outside the Columbus school or?

1231
01:43:24,951 --> 01:43:32,873
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, so I mean, I know we've talked about lottery and we've looked into that, so I've spoken to NEDS, I've brought it up and everybody's got

1232
01:43:33,840 --> 01:43:36,902
[SPEAKER_07]: all version of horror stories and advice and things.

1233
01:43:36,962 --> 01:43:42,205
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, I'm happy to try anything that I'm told to try.

1234
01:43:43,685 --> 01:43:57,753
[SPEAKER_07]: But I will, I mean, I can actually, why don't, I'm happy to put together some sort of best of from what I've learned from the network to say what lottery questions, you know, trials and tribulations they've experienced.

1235
01:43:59,234 --> 01:44:00,615
[SPEAKER_07]: But I mean, I'm with you because

1236
01:44:01,613 --> 01:44:04,535
[SPEAKER_07]: I just feel like there's no fair, equitable answer.

1237
01:44:04,635 --> 01:44:10,538
[SPEAKER_07]: And equity is the number one priority.

1238
01:44:11,739 --> 01:44:14,640
[SPEAKER_19]: Do you have a question which has come up now at least for two years?

1239
01:44:14,741 --> 01:44:15,541
[SPEAKER_19]: Is this your third year?

1240
01:44:15,861 --> 01:44:16,341
[SPEAKER_19]: No, second.

1241
01:44:16,562 --> 01:44:16,942
[SPEAKER_19]: Second year.

1242
01:44:17,002 --> 01:44:17,282
[SPEAKER_19]: OK.

1243
01:44:17,302 --> 01:44:18,163
[SPEAKER_19]: So maybe it's only come up.

1244
01:44:18,383 --> 01:44:20,164
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, I think it came up before you were appointed.

1245
01:44:21,404 --> 01:44:21,925
[SPEAKER_19]: The budget.

1246
01:44:22,505 --> 01:44:28,528
[SPEAKER_19]: So we've heard that everyone pays in a system, but you don't get to see what the program brings in.

1247
01:44:28,568 --> 01:44:31,130
[SPEAKER_19]: And then you do pay for the snacks and the crafts.

1248
01:44:31,631 --> 01:44:35,254
[SPEAKER_19]: So are you now able to see your whole spreadsheet?

1249
01:44:35,714 --> 01:44:44,201
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have access to any, um, any of the online paperwork, but I keep now, now that I've been here longer, I keep my own spreadsheets.

1250
01:44:44,361 --> 01:44:49,465
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm, you know, I'm keeping track of what bills we're putting out and what, what we're spending.

1251
01:44:49,825 --> 01:44:50,006
[SPEAKER_19]: Right.

1252
01:44:50,066 --> 01:44:53,368
[SPEAKER_19]: What made me think of it was because the wage is going to go up.

1253
01:44:53,548 --> 01:44:57,251
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's going to be a bump in your wages or your salary line item.

1254
01:44:57,872 --> 01:45:00,534
[SPEAKER_19]: And then will that, is that already planned for uncovered for,

1255
01:45:01,078 --> 01:45:02,499
[SPEAKER_19]: with what you bring in in tuition?

1256
01:45:03,139 --> 01:45:07,181
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure that will be covered in a future meeting with the superintendents.

1257
01:45:08,301 --> 01:45:08,442
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

1258
01:45:10,282 --> 01:45:10,603
[SPEAKER_17]: Very good.

1259
01:45:10,763 --> 01:45:11,143
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1260
01:45:11,163 --> 01:45:11,663
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Benedetto.

1261
01:45:11,683 --> 01:45:22,128
[SPEAKER_17]: I just wanted to go back and make sure that all employees are at least making their own way.

1262
01:45:22,148 --> 01:45:24,449
[SPEAKER_16]: I have to.

1263
01:45:24,469 --> 01:45:29,252
[SPEAKER_16]: In order to get people to take these jobs, we have to offer

1264
01:45:31,293 --> 01:45:35,195
[SPEAKER_16]: at least minimum wage, just like every other employer in the state.

1265
01:45:35,295 --> 01:45:40,437
[SPEAKER_16]: And it would be very upsetting if we continued and did not at least offer that.

1266
01:45:40,537 --> 01:45:41,458
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's my first thing.

1267
01:45:41,498 --> 01:45:42,198
[SPEAKER_17]: We have to by law.

1268
01:45:42,438 --> 01:45:43,178
[SPEAKER_17]: It's required.

1269
01:45:43,498 --> 01:45:43,759
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

1270
01:45:44,399 --> 01:45:47,900
[SPEAKER_07]: So I really wish Christine Patterson were here to answer that question.

1271
01:45:48,721 --> 01:45:53,583
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll say that our starting rate for the assistant group leaders, our starting rate is $14 an hour.

1272
01:45:55,444 --> 01:45:58,245
[SPEAKER_07]: The high school staff is a Christine Patterson question.

1273
01:45:59,162 --> 01:46:00,222
[SPEAKER_16]: So you're telling me it's not.

1274
01:46:00,362 --> 01:46:15,227
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, so I'd like that update at our next meeting and the explanation as to what we're paying and what the rule is, and if not, what our moral obligation is as an employer in this community.

1275
01:46:15,747 --> 01:46:19,308
[SPEAKER_16]: So I would request that through the superintendent, please.

1276
01:46:20,220 --> 01:46:20,620
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1277
01:46:21,401 --> 01:46:27,063
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for putting this all together in the year and a half, almost two years that you've been here.

1278
01:46:27,203 --> 01:46:28,623
[SPEAKER_16]: I know you hit the ground running.

1279
01:46:29,083 --> 01:46:31,244
[SPEAKER_16]: I know you had a whole program to build.

1280
01:46:31,564 --> 01:46:39,687
[SPEAKER_16]: I know Diane Caldwell was doing this program prior to you as well as her other jobs and I thank her for all those years of that.

1281
01:46:40,068 --> 01:46:49,211
[SPEAKER_16]: But the reason we can't expand is because we have someone in your position that does care about not only the students but the staff and the school.

1282
01:46:49,658 --> 01:46:51,779
[SPEAKER_16]: and take pride in all pieces of it.

1283
01:46:52,179 --> 01:46:54,500
[SPEAKER_16]: So I applaud you for your job.

1284
01:46:54,900 --> 01:46:59,823
[SPEAKER_16]: I also do agree with my colleagues that there are more people on the wait list than you think.

1285
01:47:00,438 --> 01:47:09,980
[SPEAKER_16]: These are the people who have signed on to the wait list, and I know personal family members who have not even applied because they feel like it would take too long.

1286
01:47:11,600 --> 01:47:15,121
[SPEAKER_16]: But I don't agree with everything.

1287
01:47:15,241 --> 01:47:17,182
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't agree with keeping it secret.

1288
01:47:17,402 --> 01:47:28,464
[SPEAKER_16]: I agree with telling everybody what a great program it is, and everybody has a chance to get in there in April, and that just because you're in there now doesn't guarantee

1289
01:47:29,064 --> 01:47:32,586
[SPEAKER_16]: your seat forever and that you should take a chance and apply.

1290
01:47:33,227 --> 01:47:38,831
[SPEAKER_16]: And maybe recommend people that they know to become employed within the school.

1291
01:47:40,211 --> 01:47:41,833
[SPEAKER_16]: Celebrate some of the programs.

1292
01:47:41,853 --> 01:47:44,094
[SPEAKER_16]: Highlight them on our online.

1293
01:47:44,114 --> 01:47:45,815
[SPEAKER_16]: Highlight them in our paper.

1294
01:47:46,456 --> 01:47:50,999
[SPEAKER_16]: Show that Medfit is here working for working class families.

1295
01:47:51,419 --> 01:47:54,641
[SPEAKER_16]: That we do provide great care for our students after school.

1296
01:47:54,921 --> 01:47:57,163
[SPEAKER_16]: That we are in need of more people

1297
01:47:58,164 --> 01:48:07,792
[SPEAKER_16]: to staff these because the more we talk about it and celebrate it, the more people who have retired might want to do two days a week and come back.

1298
01:48:08,192 --> 01:48:13,576
[SPEAKER_16]: Celebrate some of those things and do it like a PR outreach.

1299
01:48:13,897 --> 01:48:17,780
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, and just make people excited like the CCSR kids.

1300
01:48:18,161 --> 01:48:21,163
[SPEAKER_16]: get them down to do projects in the afternoon and commit to that.

1301
01:48:21,183 --> 01:48:22,264
[SPEAKER_16]: We do have one CCR project.

1302
01:48:22,284 --> 01:48:24,125
[SPEAKER_16]: She's coming to teach music to our little guys.

1303
01:48:24,285 --> 01:48:25,306
[SPEAKER_16]: Awesome.

1304
01:48:25,326 --> 01:48:25,826
[SPEAKER_16]: Right.

1305
01:48:25,927 --> 01:48:31,430
[SPEAKER_16]: So there's 150 kids from Medford High School that do volunteer work.

1306
01:48:31,711 --> 01:48:37,235
[SPEAKER_16]: And I know you've exhausted very, very many ways of hiring people.

1307
01:48:37,355 --> 01:48:38,876
[SPEAKER_16]: I might have thrown you a few myself.

1308
01:48:39,736 --> 01:48:43,079
[SPEAKER_16]: But I commend the work that you do for our students.

1309
01:48:43,219 --> 01:48:47,582
[SPEAKER_16]: And I just ask that we, moving forward, make sure that all our people are paid well.

1310
01:48:48,393 --> 01:48:49,514
[SPEAKER_16]: and we celebrate them.

1311
01:48:50,134 --> 01:48:52,395
[SPEAKER_16]: Also, you should know what the income is.

1312
01:48:52,455 --> 01:48:53,975
[SPEAKER_16]: You should know that whole budget.

1313
01:48:54,095 --> 01:48:57,176
[SPEAKER_16]: I know it's not, it's a separate entity.

1314
01:48:57,756 --> 01:49:07,020
[SPEAKER_16]: I think having that information, finding out if there is extra money there to lure people in, to keep people for longer is an important piece.

1315
01:49:07,320 --> 01:49:09,781
[SPEAKER_16]: So I also ask this committee,

1316
01:49:11,337 --> 01:49:30,787
[SPEAKER_16]: to ask the superintendent to have the assistant superintendent provide us with the budget and where we are now and what we've spent so far this year on this program, what has come in, what has gone out, what we're paying for, an updated budget on this, as well as I think our school committee is due for a budget analysis.

1317
01:49:33,019 --> 01:49:40,251
[SPEAKER_16]: complete budget analysis where we are so far in our school budget, so I, you know, I request that that be done.

1318
01:49:40,812 --> 01:49:46,802
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I know, but I think that's coming, but in addition to that, add this piece to it.

1319
01:49:48,324 --> 01:49:48,624
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1320
01:50:11,297 --> 01:50:12,078
[SPEAKER_16]: that they need every day to learn.

1321
01:50:12,098 --> 01:50:19,322
[SPEAKER_16]: And that homework is also being done so parents don't have to do it at your class.

1322
01:50:19,342 --> 01:50:19,482
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.

1323
01:50:19,502 --> 01:50:19,562
[SPEAKER_17]: Ms.

1324
01:50:19,582 --> 01:50:19,843
[SPEAKER_17]: Van Kloot.

1325
01:50:19,863 --> 01:50:21,644
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1326
01:50:21,664 --> 01:50:25,606
[SPEAKER_09]: So I want to say my colleagues have done a wonderful job of covering the basis.

1327
01:50:25,986 --> 01:50:28,068
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to go a little bit further, though.

1328
01:50:28,088 --> 01:50:35,873
[SPEAKER_09]: Erwin, with yours, I would like to make a motion that we receive a financial report about the after school program.

1329
01:50:36,453 --> 01:50:39,874
[SPEAKER_09]: Specifically, I want to know what income comes out, what our expenses are.

1330
01:50:40,214 --> 01:50:41,814
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to know what staff are paid.

1331
01:50:42,875 --> 01:50:49,036
[SPEAKER_09]: I want it to be as thorough and clear so that the committee really understands what we're doing.

1332
01:50:49,476 --> 01:50:55,678
[SPEAKER_09]: In the past, I believe that some of the money that we took in was used for other expenses in the district.

1333
01:50:55,998 --> 01:50:57,478
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we need to take a look at that.

1334
01:50:57,998 --> 01:51:02,319
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm concerned because obviously staffing is an issue.

1335
01:51:02,939 --> 01:51:04,680
[SPEAKER_09]: And we mentioned the high school rate.

1336
01:51:05,720 --> 01:51:08,662
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, I totally understand.

1337
01:51:09,082 --> 01:51:11,844
[SPEAKER_09]: You said you have $14 for an assistant group leader.

1338
01:51:11,884 --> 01:51:16,968
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you know, anybody can go to Whole Foods now and start at $15.

1339
01:51:18,249 --> 01:51:21,351
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is not a position which comes with benefits.

1340
01:51:22,251 --> 01:51:37,340
[SPEAKER_09]: And so it may be a position that even though we may be competitive with other after school programs, the fact of the matter is that if maybe we have to be better than competitive, maybe we have to be the best.

1341
01:51:38,021 --> 01:51:41,142
[SPEAKER_09]: My little grandson goes to after school care in another state.

1342
01:51:41,603 --> 01:51:46,786
[SPEAKER_09]: And when I worried about availability and asked my daughter, are you going to get in?

1343
01:51:46,966 --> 01:51:47,666
[SPEAKER_09]: Is he going to get it?

1344
01:51:48,046 --> 01:51:50,468
[SPEAKER_09]: She said, Mom, every parent is guaranteed.

1345
01:51:50,828 --> 01:51:51,949
[SPEAKER_09]: to have after-school care.

1346
01:51:52,529 --> 01:51:53,890
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's where we need to be.

1347
01:51:54,290 --> 01:51:55,590
[SPEAKER_09]: It shouldn't be an issue.

1348
01:51:55,751 --> 01:51:56,791
[SPEAKER_09]: It should be every parent.

1349
01:51:57,171 --> 01:51:59,472
[SPEAKER_09]: And at the same time, we need our staff.

1350
01:51:59,993 --> 01:52:05,435
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, my experience and my past with some after-school is it can be pretty tough.

1351
01:52:05,515 --> 01:52:06,556
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was impressed.

1352
01:52:06,596 --> 01:52:17,301
[SPEAKER_09]: Like my colleague Kathy, I went to go visit the after-school program, and I was amazed at how calmly and efficiently and caringly it was run.

1353
01:52:17,381 --> 01:52:18,302
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was really proud.

1354
01:52:19,023 --> 01:52:22,072
[SPEAKER_09]: to see how wonderful our staff members were.

1355
01:52:22,554 --> 01:52:25,723
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm concerned if they're stretched, if all of a sudden they have to cover

1356
01:52:26,223 --> 01:52:30,927
[SPEAKER_09]: two classrooms if they have to cover more because someone's out sick or someone has left.

1357
01:52:31,807 --> 01:52:41,555
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the questions we have to raise is we don't need to want to be going every single year to start out at the beginning of the year being understaffed.

1358
01:52:41,976 --> 01:52:50,943
[SPEAKER_09]: So is there incentives that we can put in to keep people with us so that it's not just, you know, a short-term job but in fact something that people will commit themselves to?

1359
01:52:51,743 --> 01:52:53,545
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, you pay different money.

1360
01:52:55,186 --> 01:53:01,610
[SPEAKER_09]: At the hospital, there are certain jobs where when you're on the more difficult shifts, you get more money.

1361
01:53:02,191 --> 01:53:11,017
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're not getting benefits for a shift for a job like this, then I think you need to factor that in into the hourly pay raise.

1362
01:53:11,397 --> 01:53:16,141
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think the time has come that we really need to look at the finances to understand this.

1363
01:53:16,161 --> 01:53:18,723
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think I appreciate your report very much, Megan.

1364
01:53:19,083 --> 01:53:20,204
[SPEAKER_09]: I think this is step one.

1365
01:53:20,604 --> 01:53:21,865
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm asking for step two.

1366
01:53:21,885 --> 01:53:23,226
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1367
01:53:24,527 --> 01:53:25,408
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Russo.

1368
01:53:25,428 --> 01:53:30,591
[SPEAKER_17]: We're still talking about the paper before us.

1369
01:53:30,872 --> 01:53:32,973
[SPEAKER_17]: We can call the vote at the end of the paper discussion.

1370
01:53:33,473 --> 01:53:36,376
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to clarify that I certainly don't want to keep the program secret.

1371
01:53:36,416 --> 01:53:41,079
[SPEAKER_06]: I just think that to incentivize people to actually fill out the paperwork.

1372
01:53:41,704 --> 01:53:47,088
[SPEAKER_06]: it is absolutely necessary that they not be told that you can fill out the paperwork, you'll be number 92 on the list.

1373
01:53:47,829 --> 01:53:51,071
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no rational person filling out paperwork if they're told that.

1374
01:53:51,532 --> 01:54:04,061
[SPEAKER_06]: The person who is standing in front of the person filling it out needs to be ignorant of the size of the wait list, because we are all capable of saying, you know, I know you look kind of like a busy person.

1375
01:54:05,082 --> 01:54:08,004
[SPEAKER_06]: Can't tell you what the list is, but you can communicate it anyways.

1376
01:54:09,005 --> 01:54:10,526
[SPEAKER_06]: But that was just a point of clarification.

1377
01:54:10,933 --> 01:54:15,396
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to quickly bring up the lottery.

1378
01:54:15,416 --> 01:54:19,179
[SPEAKER_06]: I had heard the word equity come up a couple times.

1379
01:54:19,239 --> 01:54:24,163
[SPEAKER_06]: I will certainly agree that there is no perfect and equitable solution.

1380
01:54:24,603 --> 01:54:27,386
[SPEAKER_06]: There are, however, less equitable solutions.

1381
01:54:29,247 --> 01:54:35,512
[SPEAKER_06]: And the current solution is absolutely about as unequitable as we could have it.

1382
01:54:35,532 --> 01:54:39,615
[SPEAKER_06]: It benefits people who are free to take the day off, like me.

1383
01:54:41,083 --> 01:54:46,944
[SPEAKER_06]: And anybody who has a job that doesn't work well for the time when it comes time to sign up, too bad.

1384
01:54:47,224 --> 01:54:48,364
[SPEAKER_06]: And who is that going to be?

1385
01:54:48,624 --> 01:54:51,445
[SPEAKER_06]: It is going to be people that need the services more than anybody else.

1386
01:54:51,725 --> 01:54:58,806
[SPEAKER_06]: So I agree that finding a perfect solution is probably outside of the realm of possibility.

1387
01:54:59,206 --> 01:55:04,707
[SPEAKER_06]: But I would say that the current solution of who first come first serve is the worst option.

1388
01:55:08,907 --> 01:55:16,090
[SPEAKER_06]: I see you mentioned your strategic plan and I'm not sure if we would have a time, like should we have a subcommittee?

1389
01:55:16,110 --> 01:55:21,733
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, so I'm glad you just brought that because something somebody said reminded me that that's the part I forgot to tell you.

1390
01:55:22,213 --> 01:55:24,894
[SPEAKER_07]: So I started putting together just thoughts about

1391
01:55:25,545 --> 01:55:27,766
[SPEAKER_07]: what Dr. Vinson calls the bench.

1392
01:55:27,926 --> 01:55:32,749
[SPEAKER_07]: So I've been thinking about my bench and thinking about how we can, you know, build leadership from within.

1393
01:55:34,150 --> 01:55:45,456
[SPEAKER_07]: But I was coming up with really kind of obvious things and they were all things that I could say the yeah, but next to it, like, you know, try and advertise farther and wider.

1394
01:55:45,476 --> 01:55:48,838
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but we've advertised about as far and wide as humanly possible.

1395
01:55:49,278 --> 01:55:50,739
[SPEAKER_07]: So Ms.

1396
01:55:50,779 --> 01:55:51,700
[SPEAKER_07]: Caldwell told me to

1397
01:55:52,503 --> 01:55:56,305
[SPEAKER_07]: put together to reach out to the staff because the staff has loads of great ideas.

1398
01:55:56,425 --> 01:56:05,268
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just put it out to the staff to ask about putting together a strategic planning committee made up of staff and ask them if we could have you know to make sure that we've got representatives from all over.

1399
01:56:05,308 --> 01:56:06,969
[SPEAKER_07]: So we've got someone from each site.

1400
01:56:07,389 --> 01:56:21,895
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got veteran new group leaders assistant group leaders a high school staff member that we've got representation from all over the program to see what their ideas are because of course just like you know all of this they're the ones doing the actual work that will have the best ideas for how to

1401
01:56:22,868 --> 01:56:23,729
[SPEAKER_07]: Improve the program.

1402
01:56:24,089 --> 01:56:50,624
[SPEAKER_07]: So I reached out to everybody and I'm gathering right now a bunch of people have showed an interest so I think the hardest part is that it's not going to be the you know, the 90 staff members that we have all in a room together trying to come up with a strategic plan, but Yeah, I'll keep you updated on how that goes because I'm really excited about it And I would just ask I mean recommend obviously since I won't be in that that That you don't

1403
01:56:51,622 --> 01:57:03,475
[SPEAKER_06]: start from the perspective of what we can and can't afford, because I think short-circuiting strategic plans and visions based on, you know, the box we're living in keeps us in our box.

1404
01:57:03,556 --> 01:57:05,217
[SPEAKER_06]: So, thank you.

1405
01:57:05,618 --> 01:57:05,958
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1406
01:57:05,978 --> 01:57:08,121
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Ruggiero, did you wish?

1407
01:57:10,455 --> 01:57:17,278
[SPEAKER_05]: Suggestion to the amendment to the motion, I would like to have a cost-benefit analysis of what it would have cost to do complete enrollment.

1408
01:57:17,478 --> 01:57:18,459
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not impossible.

1409
01:57:18,639 --> 01:57:19,679
[SPEAKER_05]: Other districts have done it.

1410
01:57:20,219 --> 01:57:21,680
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to cost us more money.

1411
01:57:21,820 --> 01:57:22,580
[SPEAKER_05]: It's possible.

1412
01:57:22,841 --> 01:57:35,906
[SPEAKER_05]: I would like to know how much it costs, because I think it's an opportunity for our community to step above and beyond what other communities in our region do, but also recognize that other school districts in America are able to pull this off.

1413
01:57:36,147 --> 01:57:36,987
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we can too.

1414
01:57:37,207 --> 01:57:38,988
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would like to know, I would like to suggest

1415
01:57:39,568 --> 01:57:52,497
[SPEAKER_05]: that in addition to understanding where we are now, I would like an actual assessment of what this would cost us to have full enrollment, or if any kid has a need to have an after school program, we can address that need.

1416
01:57:52,877 --> 01:57:53,617
[SPEAKER_17]: Is that a motion?

1417
01:57:54,898 --> 01:57:58,040
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's an amendment or it'll be a separate motion if she doesn't want to.

1418
01:57:58,160 --> 01:57:58,841
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there a second?

1419
01:57:59,881 --> 01:58:00,902
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a second on the floor.

1420
01:58:01,122 --> 01:58:01,782
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, that's fine.

1421
01:58:01,802 --> 01:58:03,103
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, Ms.

1422
01:58:03,143 --> 01:58:05,285
[SPEAKER_17]: McLaughlin, did you, oh, sorry, Mr. Russo.

1423
01:58:08,936 --> 01:58:11,318
[SPEAKER_17]: She's not, she wasn't, it's okay, they hadn't hit the button yet.

1424
01:58:11,498 --> 01:58:11,758
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

1425
01:58:12,038 --> 01:58:13,479
[SPEAKER_17]: I just didn't thought they would.

1426
01:58:13,559 --> 01:58:20,904
[SPEAKER_06]: I would just, I certainly absolutely would support this universal after school.

1427
01:58:21,385 --> 01:58:27,249
[SPEAKER_06]: I just would say that that analysis, I imagine, would take six to nine months at least.

1428
01:58:27,769 --> 01:58:31,031
[SPEAKER_06]: And what Paulette's asking for, I think we could have at the next meeting.

1429
01:58:31,152 --> 01:58:32,512
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just think that

1430
01:58:33,933 --> 01:58:42,697
[SPEAKER_06]: From a scope perspective, I'm a little concerned about the change in that motion, because I was looking forward to that versus... It can be an A and a B motion, separate motions.

1431
01:58:43,077 --> 01:58:43,917
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1432
01:58:44,078 --> 01:58:44,378
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1433
01:58:45,438 --> 01:58:45,818
[SPEAKER_17]: Very good.

1434
01:58:46,299 --> 01:58:46,659
[SPEAKER_17]: Ms.

1435
01:58:46,719 --> 01:58:47,299
[SPEAKER_17]: McLaughlin.

1436
01:58:47,559 --> 01:58:48,019
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1437
01:58:48,640 --> 01:58:49,800
[SPEAKER_26]: Thanks for the report.

1438
01:58:49,820 --> 01:58:50,540
[SPEAKER_26]: Very informative.

1439
01:58:50,620 --> 01:58:58,304
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm wondering just also in terms of equity and also being new, obviously, how accommodations are made for

1440
01:58:58,998 --> 01:59:05,540
[SPEAKER_26]: And say, for example, a student who is an English learner or a student who has a disability that wants to participate in the after school program.

1441
01:59:06,560 --> 01:59:09,021
[SPEAKER_07]: So we make accommodations as best we can.

1442
01:59:10,342 --> 01:59:20,165
[SPEAKER_07]: We work closely with the school day staff to find out what we can about the students and what information the school day staff thinks we need to know about the students, like what works, what

1443
01:59:22,774 --> 01:59:23,534
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, tips.

1444
01:59:23,654 --> 01:59:26,175
[SPEAKER_07]: We ask families if we can share the 504.

1445
01:59:27,095 --> 01:59:40,637
[SPEAKER_07]: My understanding is that as Medford Public Schools employees, that's one of the great things is we skip the FERPA confidentiality, but we still ask, just out of respect for the families, if we can look at 504 NIEP plans.

1446
01:59:41,998 --> 01:59:46,278
[SPEAKER_07]: But, again, my staff are not professional educators, but they're not all certified educators.

1447
01:59:50,575 --> 02:00:03,101
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's dangerous to just hand off the IEPs, so we work closely with the school day staff and the adjustment counselors in the special ed department to help us navigate those IEPs and tell us what it should look like in the after school program.

1448
02:00:05,162 --> 02:00:08,743
[SPEAKER_07]: Where I can or where I've been able to, we've gotten trainings.

1449
02:00:09,044 --> 02:00:15,787
[SPEAKER_07]: So on some of the professional development days, some of my staff members went to a couple of the different professional developments that were offered.

1450
02:00:18,299 --> 02:00:20,881
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's really case by case.

1451
02:00:21,001 --> 02:00:32,651
[SPEAKER_07]: We just look at it, find out from the... I send the full roster to the principals and vice principals at the beginning of the year to say which students do we need to kind of be briefed on.

1452
02:00:33,091 --> 02:00:36,214
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's where we get ahead and then make sure to create relationships with the families.

1453
02:00:36,974 --> 02:00:38,996
[SPEAKER_07]: That's where we've had success so far.

1454
02:00:40,137 --> 02:00:40,477
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1455
02:00:40,757 --> 02:00:41,438
[SPEAKER_17]: All set?

1456
02:00:42,325 --> 02:00:42,685
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1457
02:00:43,065 --> 02:00:44,426
[SPEAKER_17]: There are two motions on the floor.

1458
02:00:44,446 --> 02:00:49,769
[SPEAKER_17]: The first, motion A, complete financial analysis of the program offered by Ms.

1459
02:00:49,809 --> 02:00:50,889
[SPEAKER_17]: Vandekloot, seconded by Ms.

1460
02:00:50,909 --> 02:00:51,669
[SPEAKER_17]: DiVenedetto.

1461
02:00:51,689 --> 02:00:53,310
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor?

1462
02:00:54,351 --> 02:00:55,131
[SPEAKER_17]: All those opposed?

1463
02:01:01,174 --> 02:01:03,315
[SPEAKER_17]: This is just to get to the financial analysis.

1464
02:01:03,515 --> 02:01:06,116
[SPEAKER_17]: This doesn't impact wages or anything else.

1465
02:01:06,156 --> 02:01:07,717
[SPEAKER_17]: You're just asking for a report back.

1466
02:01:08,137 --> 02:01:08,317
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

1467
02:01:10,118 --> 02:01:10,879
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor?

1468
02:01:12,573 --> 02:01:15,894
[SPEAKER_17]: Asking what the wages are, not changing them.

1469
02:01:16,454 --> 02:01:16,835
[SPEAKER_17]: Correct.

1470
02:01:18,215 --> 02:01:18,375
[SPEAKER_17]: Yep.

1471
02:01:19,796 --> 02:01:19,976
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

1472
02:01:20,696 --> 02:01:21,456
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor?

1473
02:01:22,277 --> 02:01:22,977
[SPEAKER_17]: All those opposed?

1474
02:01:23,497 --> 02:01:24,237
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion carries.

1475
02:01:24,677 --> 02:01:28,279
[SPEAKER_17]: Item B, a cost-benefit analysis of universal after-school care.

1476
02:01:30,199 --> 02:01:31,640
[SPEAKER_17]: By Mr. Giro, seconded by Ms.

1477
02:01:31,680 --> 02:01:32,400
[SPEAKER_17]: Van de Kloot.

1478
02:01:32,700 --> 02:01:33,461
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor?

1479
02:01:34,381 --> 02:01:35,141
[SPEAKER_17]: All those opposed?

1480
02:01:35,901 --> 02:01:36,582
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion granted.

1481
02:01:37,362 --> 02:01:38,202
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you very much.

1482
02:01:38,262 --> 02:01:38,622
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1483
02:01:38,642 --> 02:01:40,223
[SPEAKER_17]: Happy Thanksgiving.

1484
02:01:44,910 --> 02:01:47,031
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion to accept the report and place it on file.

1485
02:01:47,171 --> 02:01:48,392
[SPEAKER_17]: Seconded by Mr. Russo.

1486
02:01:48,432 --> 02:01:49,252
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor?

1487
02:01:49,272 --> 02:01:50,253
[SPEAKER_17]: All those opposed?

1488
02:01:50,293 --> 02:01:51,133
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes.

1489
02:01:52,134 --> 02:01:54,135
[SPEAKER_17]: Report on math learning walks.

1490
02:02:02,259 --> 02:02:02,760
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, I'm sorry.

1491
02:02:04,801 --> 02:02:05,321
[SPEAKER_17]: A very

1492
02:02:14,917 --> 02:02:18,499
[SPEAKER_25]: a very brief presentation to share with the committee.

1493
02:02:20,841 --> 02:02:27,305
[SPEAKER_25]: This year we have continued to expand our learning walks.

1494
02:02:34,909 --> 02:02:42,394
[SPEAKER_25]: And I think the video, the video will kind of put into pictures

1495
02:02:44,423 --> 02:02:46,124
[SPEAKER_25]: what I could say through words.

1496
02:02:47,065 --> 02:02:53,488
[SPEAKER_25]: The one thing that is different this year than what occurred from last year is that we have scaled it up.

1497
02:02:54,949 --> 02:03:02,013
[SPEAKER_25]: It's not only the four elementary schools, but it's all the middle schools and the high schools, including the Curtis Tufts.

1498
02:03:04,354 --> 02:03:08,836
[SPEAKER_25]: And so, Dr. Cushing, are you able to push play?

1499
02:03:11,218 --> 02:03:11,518
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

1500
02:03:24,227 --> 02:03:24,607
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

1501
02:03:56,150 --> 02:04:00,894
[SPEAKER_25]: Also this year, we had the pleasure of having school committee members join us.

1502
02:04:01,654 --> 02:04:03,495
[SPEAKER_25]: So you'll see some of your colleagues there.

1503
02:04:04,956 --> 02:04:11,821
[SPEAKER_25]: We had all administrators participate in at least one, if not two, learning walks district-wide.

1504
02:04:14,804 --> 02:04:16,125
[SPEAKER_25]: That was at Curtis Tufts School.

1505
02:04:27,564 --> 02:04:27,645
uh

1506
02:04:50,275 --> 02:04:57,360
[SPEAKER_25]: An important part of the learning walk process is the debrief, which takes place at the end of every learning walk.

1507
02:04:57,400 --> 02:05:11,992
[SPEAKER_25]: So throughout these videos, clips, you're seeing several administrators around a table debriefing, discussing the core actions, and talking about next steps for each school.

1508
02:05:18,780 --> 02:05:23,431
[SPEAKER_25]: All learning walks included students that were L's and students with disabilities.

1509
02:05:24,513 --> 02:05:26,577
[SPEAKER_25]: So we were focusing on subgroups as well.

1510
02:05:47,808 --> 02:05:59,311
[SPEAKER_20]: That was an ordering list.

1511
02:05:59,951 --> 02:06:06,313
[SPEAKER_12]: They were ordering number zero.

1512
02:06:36,143 --> 02:06:41,266
here we go left to right

1513
02:07:03,898 --> 02:07:05,719
[SPEAKER_00]: They were kind of doing that in the fourth grade class.

1514
02:07:05,759 --> 02:07:09,961
[SPEAKER_02]: We were making a revival of a different lens, I had to ask.

1515
02:07:16,465 --> 02:07:18,045
We've been talking about parallel.

1516
02:07:44,260 --> 02:07:45,421
[SPEAKER_20]: Give me a rating.

1517
02:07:45,461 --> 02:07:45,921
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1518
02:08:10,512 --> 02:08:11,313
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. Russo.

1519
02:08:12,513 --> 02:08:12,953
[SPEAKER_17]: Very good.

1520
02:08:12,973 --> 02:08:16,235
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there anything else on?

1521
02:08:17,176 --> 02:08:38,427
[SPEAKER_25]: So essentially, I hope, even though it was a very short video clip, the intention was to show how we as a district are scaling up our instructional eye, that we're taking instruction very seriously, that all administrators, principals, assistant principals,

1522
02:08:39,787 --> 02:08:52,279
[SPEAKER_25]: Headmasters, not only were administrators participating in their own respective school, but every principal or headmaster participated in a different school as well.

1523
02:08:52,839 --> 02:09:04,690
[SPEAKER_25]: So the conversation that was happening, the pushing, the professional pushing and pulling on one another, looking at instruction, we continue to focus on

1524
02:09:06,551 --> 02:09:12,135
[SPEAKER_25]: Mathematics as an area that we're paying very close attention to it.

1525
02:09:12,896 --> 02:09:20,562
[SPEAKER_25]: And again, as I said before, we included special education administrators.

1526
02:09:21,282 --> 02:09:24,365
[SPEAKER_25]: Mr. Paul Textera, our EL administrator.

1527
02:09:24,805 --> 02:09:31,310
[SPEAKER_25]: Mr. Rocco Cieri, all administrators, irregardless of what your content was, participated.

1528
02:09:31,910 --> 02:09:40,673
[SPEAKER_25]: in a learning walk, contributing towards our intentionality on instruction, improving teaching and learning for all of our students.

1529
02:09:43,494 --> 02:09:44,514
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you very much.

1530
02:09:44,534 --> 02:09:47,415
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion to accept this report and place it on file by Ms.

1531
02:09:47,455 --> 02:09:50,116
[SPEAKER_17]: Kurtz, second by Mr. Ruggiero.

1532
02:09:50,936 --> 02:09:51,536
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor?

1533
02:09:51,556 --> 02:09:51,616
[SPEAKER_17]: Aye.

1534
02:09:52,196 --> 02:09:52,876
[SPEAKER_17]: All those opposed?

1535
02:09:52,976 --> 02:09:53,697
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes.

1536
02:09:54,437 --> 02:09:57,558
[SPEAKER_17]: Report on superintendent's goals, Dr. Maurice-Edward Vincent.

1537
02:09:59,004 --> 02:10:04,350
[SPEAKER_25]: So my final report today is on my goals for 1920.

1538
02:10:04,490 --> 02:10:14,122
[SPEAKER_25]: I wanted to use the video for you to see the instructional work that is happening in the school.

1539
02:10:15,582 --> 02:10:20,604
[SPEAKER_25]: We've been working, a cross-functional group of us, under district improvement goals.

1540
02:10:21,844 --> 02:10:30,527
[SPEAKER_25]: We've been working on our strategic plan, looking at what is happening academically and really trying to connect that.

1541
02:10:31,228 --> 02:10:43,612
[SPEAKER_25]: So, right now we're in the process of synthesizing our district priority goals, which have been in place, to develop a targeted multi-year plan to guide all of our work.

1542
02:10:44,452 --> 02:10:53,497
[SPEAKER_25]: our partnerships, etc., anything that is school-related, always remembering to keep that laser-like focus on instruction.

1543
02:10:55,420 --> 02:10:58,481
[SPEAKER_25]: The cross-functional team has already convened.

1544
02:10:58,521 --> 02:11:00,402
[SPEAKER_25]: We've been working collaboratively.

1545
02:11:02,203 --> 02:11:14,027
[SPEAKER_25]: We are in the midst of really trying to finalize and provide additional data on our strategic plan based on the goals that we've been working on in the past.

1546
02:11:15,856 --> 02:11:17,116
[SPEAKER_25]: So that will be more to come.

1547
02:11:17,136 --> 02:11:20,397
[SPEAKER_25]: We would like to present that next month to the committee.

1548
02:11:20,417 --> 02:11:30,519
[SPEAKER_25]: Our district-wide focus on instruction, as last year we started the learning walk protocol within the district, which was a new practice.

1549
02:11:31,020 --> 02:11:36,781
[SPEAKER_25]: This year, if you look at that, we are asking, or what we've done already,

1550
02:11:37,441 --> 02:11:53,950
[SPEAKER_25]: is increase that scope to include all secondary schools, so it's the entire district that is participating in learning walks, looking at mathematics instruction, using common language, the five core actions,

1551
02:11:54,330 --> 02:12:08,086
[SPEAKER_25]: to ground our conversations and again expanding it to all administrators so that everyone has skin in the game, everyone is invested in the work that's happening instructionally.

1552
02:12:09,608 --> 02:12:10,729
[SPEAKER_25]: Our student learning goal

1553
02:12:12,323 --> 02:12:14,344
[SPEAKER_25]: I am on page two right now.

1554
02:12:15,085 --> 02:12:23,470
[SPEAKER_25]: Our student learning goal, again, math being the content area that as a district we are working on making improvements.

1555
02:12:24,210 --> 02:12:36,538
[SPEAKER_25]: If you recall a year ago, I spoke about a very ambitious goal of trying to see a 10% improvement at the elementary level.

1556
02:12:38,584 --> 02:12:44,146
[SPEAKER_25]: At the bottom of page two, I specifically targeted grades three through five.

1557
02:12:45,086 --> 02:12:56,670
[SPEAKER_25]: Last year we were at 40.6% of students that were meeting or exceeding state expectations according to the MCAS.

1558
02:12:58,070 --> 02:13:00,411
[SPEAKER_25]: So we moved from 40.6 to 43.3%.

1559
02:13:05,780 --> 02:13:08,301
[SPEAKER_25]: which was an increase of approximately 6.7%.

1560
02:13:10,601 --> 02:13:21,604
[SPEAKER_25]: However, I had hoped to see an increase of 10%, which is very aggressive, but nonetheless, I had hoped we would have hit the target of 45%.

1561
02:13:23,645 --> 02:13:27,046
[SPEAKER_25]: So we did not make that target this first year.

1562
02:13:27,806 --> 02:13:32,768
[SPEAKER_25]: So once again, I am putting another aggressive target of an additional 10%.

1563
02:13:34,628 --> 02:13:42,775
[SPEAKER_25]: So I would like to see us hit a target of 47.6% next year at the elementary level.

1564
02:13:44,056 --> 02:13:51,022
[SPEAKER_25]: Again, I feel that that is a reasonable goal to see another 10% increase.

1565
02:13:51,863 --> 02:13:55,146
[SPEAKER_25]: And I want to, although we weren't able to make 10% last year, it was 6.7%.

1566
02:13:57,568 --> 02:14:09,177
[SPEAKER_25]: I still feel that we have to have a standard of something that we are moving towards and so I'm keeping that goal of 10% and just wanting to see that needle move every single year.

1567
02:14:09,817 --> 02:14:17,663
[SPEAKER_25]: So my student learning goal is to continue to see noted improvement at the elementary level in mathematics.

1568
02:14:19,483 --> 02:14:29,654
[SPEAKER_25]: My professional practice goal continues to be the work that I'm doing with the new superintendents induction program where I travel almost on a monthly basis to Marlboro.

1569
02:14:30,375 --> 02:14:33,138
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm part of a cohort of 40 superintendents.

1570
02:14:34,779 --> 02:14:41,000
[SPEAKER_25]: that are participating in DESE designed professional development for superintendents.

1571
02:14:41,580 --> 02:14:52,282
[SPEAKER_25]: And so this is our professional practice goal that they are continuing to provide the professional development and guidance for the work that we're doing.

1572
02:14:52,822 --> 02:14:56,003
[SPEAKER_25]: So my professional practice goal, I'm in year two.

1573
02:14:56,243 --> 02:15:02,284
[SPEAKER_25]: I have one more year with the NISP training as the formal professional practice goal.

1574
02:15:03,250 --> 02:15:13,958
[SPEAKER_25]: So I wanted to get this into your hands for you to have access to it and see what it is that I'm working on and what I hope to achieve during this school year, 19-20.

1575
02:15:14,559 --> 02:15:16,060
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

1576
02:15:16,460 --> 02:15:19,162
[SPEAKER_17]: Are you requesting a motion to accept your goals?

1577
02:15:19,402 --> 02:15:22,645
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes, I am requesting a motion to accept my goals.

1578
02:15:22,825 --> 02:15:25,146
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Russo, did you have a question on this or no?

1579
02:15:25,166 --> 02:15:25,407
[SPEAKER_17]: I did.

1580
02:15:25,427 --> 02:15:26,187
[SPEAKER_17]: I didn't know if you did.

1581
02:15:26,267 --> 02:15:27,108
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I did.

1582
02:15:28,249 --> 02:15:28,609
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1583
02:15:29,410 --> 02:15:31,351
[SPEAKER_06]: I definitely appreciate this.

1584
02:15:32,975 --> 02:15:47,158
[SPEAKER_06]: I was at the school committee conference all of last week after the election, and I talked with numerous people about superintendent goals because of the new superintendent evaluation system, which is a vast improvement.

1585
02:15:48,819 --> 02:15:55,340
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of the things that sort of struck me was that it felt like our goals were kind

1586
02:15:56,813 --> 02:16:09,184
[SPEAKER_06]: you decided on what the goals were and I know we met last year about them and I don't think it didn't, I think it worked fine last year because it felt like we didn't really have a set of goals to hand you.

1587
02:16:10,865 --> 02:16:15,049
[SPEAKER_06]: But what I heard from a lot of other people at the school committee conference was really that

1588
02:16:15,640 --> 02:16:21,827
[SPEAKER_06]: The goals were not the superintendents picked their goals and we just agree that those are the goals.

1589
02:16:22,268 --> 02:16:28,635
[SPEAKER_06]: It was that there are goals that we give you in sort of that employee boss relationship.

1590
02:16:28,715 --> 02:16:30,317
[SPEAKER_06]: The employee doesn't get to decide.

1591
02:16:30,757 --> 02:16:33,120
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's what I think my goals are and the boss just says,

1592
02:16:33,879 --> 02:16:34,600
[SPEAKER_06]: two thumbs up.

1593
02:16:35,981 --> 02:16:45,430
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, you know, I certainly understand that we agreed to this last year, and this was something we were very new about, new to us, or at least new to me.

1594
02:16:46,210 --> 02:16:54,258
[SPEAKER_06]: But I feel like I just want to make it clear that, like, in the spring of this coming year, I expect that the school committee will be getting together to tell you

1595
02:16:55,218 --> 02:16:56,039
[SPEAKER_06]: Working with you.

1596
02:16:56,059 --> 02:17:06,048
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not like we're just gonna like sit in a room and then let you know What the new Stern student learning goal will be for 2020?

1597
02:17:06,088 --> 02:17:15,357
[SPEAKER_06]: 2021 and that it's not necessarily going to be the same thing and I I don't want it to be that You know in in the spring

1598
02:17:16,088 --> 02:17:26,630
[SPEAKER_06]: as we get ready for the end of the school year, you just tell us this is what you think the new goal should be because I certainly have pretty strong opinions on what I think the new goal should be in the next school year.

1599
02:17:28,071 --> 02:17:32,772
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm fine with this one even though I didn't agree with the whole committee last year about what it is.

1600
02:17:32,792 --> 02:17:43,834
[SPEAKER_06]: I just sort of wanted to get that out there that in the spring, we need to do this before the end of the school year because you can't start working on a goal in the fall.

1601
02:17:45,013 --> 02:17:46,114
[SPEAKER_06]: if you don't even know what it is.

1602
02:17:47,315 --> 02:17:56,544
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know the right timing for that, but I do think we want to make sure to keep this on the radar, because this is the two-year goals, and the two years is coming up.

1603
02:17:58,575 --> 02:18:06,938
[SPEAKER_25]: So I just want to comment that the goals from last year were guided through NISPP based on the data that was available.

1604
02:18:07,438 --> 02:18:10,880
[SPEAKER_25]: Because when I started, the MCAS data had already come out.

1605
02:18:11,980 --> 02:18:18,283
[SPEAKER_25]: So through the coursework that I'm taking with NISPP, when they looked also at the data and said, this is where you are.

1606
02:18:19,524 --> 02:18:21,747
[SPEAKER_25]: Math, again, was one of the goals.

1607
02:18:23,108 --> 02:18:32,000
[SPEAKER_25]: NISPP was the one that said year one for superintendents is the entry plan because the entry plan is a year-long process.

1608
02:18:32,861 --> 02:18:37,246
[SPEAKER_25]: Some of the work that you see here, this being year two, this is part of

1609
02:18:37,967 --> 02:18:42,069
[SPEAKER_25]: the curriculum or coursework that we're doing with NISP as well.

1610
02:18:42,549 --> 02:18:54,015
[SPEAKER_25]: And so, um, when I had said the 10% last year, I was encouraged by Dr. Bair, Carla Bair, who said, go for something, um, aggressive, even if you don't achieve it.

1611
02:18:54,595 --> 02:19:02,840
[SPEAKER_25]: So I'm definitely open to, you know, next year or at the end of this school year to change, um, the goals.

1612
02:19:02,860 --> 02:19:05,241
[SPEAKER_25]: But I want you to know that I've, you know, this wasn't,

1613
02:19:06,021 --> 02:19:07,483
[SPEAKER_25]: I just didn't wake up and just do it.

1614
02:19:07,583 --> 02:19:15,474
[SPEAKER_25]: It was part of the curriculum that we're kind of following and the coursework that we're taking through NSSEP.

1615
02:19:15,674 --> 02:19:19,680
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and this is certainly, I'm not suggesting this was a surprise to me or anything like that.

1616
02:19:20,481 --> 02:19:21,142
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just that, you know.

1617
02:19:23,740 --> 02:19:32,083
[SPEAKER_06]: The process of deciding on what the very small set of goals will be going forward hopefully will be more collaborative.

1618
02:19:32,103 --> 02:19:41,566
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean you were new and we didn't have goals from the previous superintendent so it wasn't like we had anything to go on but just going forward.

1619
02:19:41,886 --> 02:19:42,586
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want us to be next fall.

1620
02:19:46,095 --> 02:20:02,665
[SPEAKER_06]: not having a set of goals that we've agreed and approved, because my biggest concern about goals is, this is how we are supposed to, with the new superintendent evaluation system, this is how we actually are going to be reviewing you, evaluating you.

1621
02:20:03,346 --> 02:20:10,630
[SPEAKER_06]: The old system, which was absolutely horrific, and I only got to experience once so far, was honestly was a joke.

1622
02:20:10,930 --> 02:20:15,333
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, this one is simple and clear and you will,

1623
02:20:16,675 --> 02:20:21,541
[SPEAKER_06]: actually be able to be evaluated on very simple things that are written down here.

1624
02:20:22,121 --> 02:20:26,506
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I want to make sure we can evaluate you honestly and fairly.

1625
02:20:28,148 --> 02:20:28,969
[SPEAKER_06]: So, that's all.

1626
02:20:29,810 --> 02:20:30,150
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1627
02:20:32,643 --> 02:20:43,508
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, like my colleague, I've thought about this, and what he just said was sort of on key, that these, this plan is really for the purposes of evaluating the superintendent.

1628
02:20:44,048 --> 02:20:52,732
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think many of the school committee members, and I know that as we just went through this election, many of us said, we need a strategic plan for the district.

1629
02:20:52,852 --> 02:20:56,533
[SPEAKER_09]: And that wasn't limited to, I mean, this is very focused.

1630
02:20:57,814 --> 02:20:59,835
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe that we need to take a look at

1631
02:21:00,417 --> 02:21:09,869
[SPEAKER_09]: the district and set a strategic plan, and maybe we should call it the school committee strategic plan as opposed to the superintendent's strategic plan, to take a look at all the factors and say,

1632
02:21:10,419 --> 02:21:13,962
[SPEAKER_09]: where do we want to be in three years, in five years?

1633
02:21:15,183 --> 02:21:16,243
[SPEAKER_09]: What is our projection?

1634
02:21:16,824 --> 02:21:31,074
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's a different type of strategic plan than this evaluation piece, which is obviously moving us forward and specifically geared to

1635
02:21:32,915 --> 02:21:34,196
[SPEAKER_09]: mathematics instruction.

1636
02:21:34,316 --> 02:21:43,038
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm sure that with my colleagues we'll be doing that and we should be talking about what type of meetings we want to set up.

1637
02:21:43,698 --> 02:21:48,220
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think that those kind of discussions work within a regular school committee meeting.

1638
02:21:48,800 --> 02:21:58,363
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it would be more important to take a look at a different venue and to really lay out some time and see what the vision is.

1639
02:21:58,703 --> 02:22:01,804
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'll certainly, and I know that many other of my colleagues

1640
02:22:02,164 --> 02:22:03,445
[SPEAKER_09]: we're thinking that way as well.

1641
02:22:04,746 --> 02:22:05,146
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1642
02:22:06,267 --> 02:22:11,250
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there a motion on the floor to accept these goals that the superintendent has laid out for the remainder of this year?

1643
02:22:12,571 --> 02:22:13,612
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion by Mr. Benedetto.

1644
02:22:13,652 --> 02:22:14,233
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there a second?

1645
02:22:14,773 --> 02:22:15,013
[SPEAKER_17]: Second.

1646
02:22:15,033 --> 02:22:15,213
[SPEAKER_17]: Ms.

1647
02:22:15,233 --> 02:22:15,513
[SPEAKER_17]: Kretz.

1648
02:22:16,254 --> 02:22:17,095
[SPEAKER_17]: Roll call vote please.

1649
02:22:25,640 --> 02:22:25,921

[SPEAKER_06]: Is this not the new business section?

1669
02:23:36,452 --> 02:23:39,754
[SPEAKER_17]: Normally, new business would be on the agenda.

1670
02:23:40,754 --> 02:23:45,217
[SPEAKER_17]: And then the motion would be sent somewhere so that everyone has an opportunity to know what the topic is.

1671
02:23:46,665 --> 02:23:46,945
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

1672

1676
02:23:55,571 --> 02:23:57,893
[SPEAKER_17]: Open meeting law to me, it's open meeting law.

1677
02:23:58,173 --> 02:24:02,416

1678

[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I don't want to object to your ruling.

1679
02:24:04,637 --> 02:24:05,798
[SPEAKER_17]: It's an open meeting law.

1680
02:24:05,838 --> 02:24:10,341
[SPEAKER_17]: Generally, you have things on the agenda written clearly so the public knows what you're going to talk about.

1681
02:24:10,421 --> 02:24:14,064
[SPEAKER_17]: So if they want to be here to talk about it, they have ample opportunity to.

1682
02:24:14,384 --> 02:24:15,825
[SPEAKER_17]: That's the purpose of open meeting law.

1683
02:24:17,681 --> 02:24:18,061
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1684
02:24:18,722 --> 02:24:19,082
[SPEAKER_17]: That's all.

1685
02:24:19,403 --> 02:24:20,444
[SPEAKER_17]: You just have to put it on.

1686
02:24:21,304 --> 02:24:40,542
[SPEAKER_06]: When I was at the school committee conference, I went to a double session on parliamentary procedures and that was explicitly explained as that under new business, it only had to be things that the chair was aware of being on there, which did kind of, wasn't a front to open meeting law in my mind as well.

1687
02:24:41,262 --> 02:24:45,263
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm a little, just bear with me for a moment.

1688
02:24:45,783 --> 02:24:56,725
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, the three things I was thinking I wanted to send to subcommittee, having people show up where the whole discussion is, I'd like to send something to subcommittee, there's no discussion.

1689
02:24:58,205 --> 02:24:59,185
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, you could write it that way.

1690
02:24:59,205 --> 02:25:00,165
[SPEAKER_06]: Discussions in the subcommittee.

1691
02:25:00,185 --> 02:25:06,626
[SPEAKER_17]: You could make your motion in that form that I'd like to offer this topic be sent to the subcommittee on rules or whatever it is.

1692
02:25:07,106 --> 02:25:09,967
[SPEAKER_17]: So you could put it in there so it's clear that that's your purpose.

1693
02:25:11,756 --> 02:25:11,976
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1694
02:25:12,856 --> 02:25:13,317
[SPEAKER_06]: I can do that.

1695
02:25:13,817 --> 02:25:18,379
[SPEAKER_17]: Or it could go to subcommittee right out.

1696
02:25:18,899 --> 02:25:24,401
[SPEAKER_17]: Subcommittee can have a meeting on any topic and they post the meeting, the topic, and then people can come to that.

1697
02:25:25,101 --> 02:25:26,042
[SPEAKER_06]: That's an option too.

1698
02:25:26,082 --> 02:25:27,342
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't have to send it from the floor.

1699
02:25:27,362 --> 02:25:27,582
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.

1700
02:25:27,823 --> 02:25:31,364
[SPEAKER_17]: It can go there, start there, and the work could be done there, and then it comes to the floor.

1701
02:25:32,404 --> 02:25:32,664
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1702
02:25:32,845 --> 02:25:33,205
[SPEAKER_17]: Either way.

1703
02:25:36,006 --> 02:25:36,366
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

1704
02:25:36,426 --> 02:25:39,007
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you'll have to wait until you see the agenda.

1705
02:25:41,638 --> 02:25:43,199
[SPEAKER_06]: Now you're all going to be busy with these.

1706
02:25:43,219 --> 02:25:45,841
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, thank you.

1707

1712
02:26:02,471 --> 02:26:04,412
[SPEAKER_17]: I can state that there was no change.

1713
02:26:05,733 --> 02:26:06,033
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

1714
02:26:06,373 --> 02:26:07,554
[SPEAKER_17]: We're talking about soccer.

1715
02:26:08,654 --> 02:26:08,835
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

1716
02:26:10,015 --> 02:26:10,676
[SPEAKER_17]: What are we talking about?

1717

[SPEAKER_17]: Just a few of you have to leave.

1724
