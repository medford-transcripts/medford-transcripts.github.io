1
00:00:00,071 --> 00:00:02,852
Okay, we may as well get started.

2
00:00:04,232 --> 00:00:14,174
The emergency public meeting of the City of Medford Liquor License Commission for 8-23-24 will come to order.

3
00:00:16,115 --> 00:00:18,415
We do have an agenda for this meeting.

4
00:00:19,256 --> 00:00:26,397
And I don't think, we don't need to do the minutes of the last meeting, correct, Daria?

5
00:00:26,437 --> 00:00:27,918
We can wait till the next monthly meeting?

6
00:00:27,938 --> 00:00:28,898
Yeah, next month, yep.

7
00:00:29,386 --> 00:00:29,947
Okay, great.

8
00:00:31,728 --> 00:00:37,413
Okay, so why don't we get right into that then?

9
00:00:38,554 --> 00:00:39,775
Get right into the agenda.

10
00:00:39,815 --> 00:00:42,797
We'll go right down the list.

11
00:00:42,877 --> 00:00:47,621
Representative from the City of Medford will present for a one-day license application.

12
00:00:47,641 --> 00:00:50,023
I think that's you, Lisa, correct?

13
00:00:50,395 --> 00:00:52,196
Yes, yes, thank you so much.

14
00:00:52,617 --> 00:00:55,339
Thank you so much for having this this emergency meeting.

15
00:00:55,379 --> 00:01:01,143
I'm very sorry that you know you had to do it off schedule and we do appreciate it.

16
00:01:03,205 --> 00:01:03,765
Thank you.

17
00:01:04,406 --> 00:01:16,855
So yes, so we are requesting a one day license for Medford Brewing Company to be the beer garden at the upcoming pumpkin float, which is this Saturday at Wrights Pond from 6 to 8 30 PM.

18
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:21,803
We've done this for the last, I think, four years now.

19
00:01:21,823 --> 00:01:30,815
I think three of it has had a beer garden, and we have it in a specific area at the pond.

20
00:01:30,855 --> 00:01:32,817
It's right in front of the bathhouse area.

21
00:01:37,625 --> 00:01:38,005
I'm sorry?

22
00:01:38,245 --> 00:01:39,746
You used to call it the snack bar.

23
00:01:39,986 --> 00:01:42,608
The snack bar, yeah.

24
00:01:43,848 --> 00:01:44,669
Right in front of that.

25
00:01:45,749 --> 00:01:48,731
And it's cordoned off with like riot fencing.

26
00:01:49,251 --> 00:01:53,233
So, you know, people can't just kind of sweep in.

27
00:01:53,854 --> 00:01:57,196
You have to literally enter from just one specific area.

28
00:01:57,216 --> 00:02:00,657
And we have like no alcohol beyond this point signs.

29
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,441
And that's about it.

30
00:02:04,461 --> 00:02:07,865
So yeah, they're going to be serving beer and like mulled wine.

31
00:02:07,885 --> 00:02:07,966
Nice.

32
00:02:12,127 --> 00:02:14,188
Yeah, you folks do this every year.

33
00:02:14,248 --> 00:02:19,409
I guess the last couple of three years that I've been on, we've had no problems.

34
00:02:20,789 --> 00:02:21,830
It's a pretty smooth thing.

35
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:26,951
And as you say, it just kind of got bypassed in the shuffle.

36
00:02:27,011 --> 00:02:30,532
But we don't mind when there's a situation like this.

37
00:02:30,592 --> 00:02:33,392
We can ensure a special meeting.

38
00:02:33,432 --> 00:02:34,333
That's not a problem at all.

39
00:02:36,444 --> 00:02:38,306
Alan, any questions?

40
00:02:38,566 --> 00:02:40,488
No, no, I'm familiar with the event.

41
00:02:40,528 --> 00:02:41,589
I grew up up the Heights.

42
00:02:41,669 --> 00:02:43,611
I'm very familiar with Wright's Palm.

43
00:02:43,651 --> 00:02:47,815
We used to sneak in there after hours, all that stuff.

44
00:02:48,296 --> 00:02:50,438
But no, it's a great event.

45
00:02:50,698 --> 00:02:54,722
Lisa was telling me about it, because I was asking Daria if the pumpkins float.

46
00:02:55,363 --> 00:02:57,124
So they were kind of giving me an overview.

47
00:02:57,925 --> 00:03:00,326
But I'm perfectly fine with it.

48
00:03:00,986 --> 00:03:11,711
I'd like to make a motion to approve the one-day license for October 26, which is Sunday from 6-8.30 PM.

49
00:03:12,071 --> 00:03:13,631
I hope you do have 700 guests.

50
00:03:13,671 --> 00:03:14,832
That would be fantastic.

51
00:03:15,132 --> 00:03:17,313
Thank you.

52
00:03:18,473 --> 00:03:22,375
Like I said, that'd be my motion to accept the one-day license for Sunday.

53
00:03:23,671 --> 00:03:25,774
Okay, and I will second that.

54
00:03:26,315 --> 00:03:28,218
All those in favor, aye.

55
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:28,579
Aye.

56
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,061
Very good.

57
00:03:30,121 --> 00:03:31,043
It is approved.

58
00:03:31,834 --> 00:03:32,214
Awesome.

59
00:03:32,274 --> 00:03:32,674
Thank you.

60
00:03:32,694 --> 00:03:35,696
I just want to make one thing.

61
00:03:35,756 --> 00:03:36,656
It's for Saturday.

62
00:03:36,676 --> 00:03:37,876
Oh, I'm sorry.

63
00:03:38,137 --> 00:03:38,697
That's OK.

64
00:03:38,917 --> 00:03:39,397
Sunday?

65
00:03:39,537 --> 00:03:39,757
Yeah.

66
00:03:40,057 --> 00:03:41,018
Saturday, the 26th.

67
00:03:41,098 --> 00:03:41,738
OK, perfect.

68
00:03:42,078 --> 00:03:42,298
Yeah.

69
00:03:42,338 --> 00:03:44,499
Well, the rain date's the 27th, right?

70
00:03:44,559 --> 00:03:45,179
The rain date.

71
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:45,660
Yeah.

72
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,660
Yeah, I believe the rain date's the 27th.

73
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:48,180
Correct.

74
00:03:48,721 --> 00:03:48,881
Yeah.

75
00:03:48,941 --> 00:03:49,501
I'm sorry.

76
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:49,701
So the 27th.

77
00:03:49,721 --> 00:03:50,421
No, no, that's OK.

78
00:03:51,242 --> 00:03:51,702
That's OK.

79
00:03:52,022 --> 00:03:52,762
Thank you so much.

80
00:03:52,802 --> 00:03:56,744
Again, it's much appreciated that you did this for us.

81
00:03:57,044 --> 00:03:57,864
We really, really appreciate it.

82
00:03:57,884 --> 00:03:58,324
No problem.

83
00:03:58,545 --> 00:03:58,945
Anytime.

84
00:03:58,985 --> 00:03:59,065
OK.

85
00:03:59,845 --> 00:04:00,046
Bye.

86
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:01,047
Thank you so much.

87
00:04:01,187 --> 00:04:01,407
All right.

88
00:04:01,447 --> 00:04:01,748
Ciao.

89
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:02,609
Bye, Regina.

90
00:04:05,192 --> 00:04:05,713
Okay.

91
00:04:06,674 --> 00:04:07,375
Let's see.

92
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:12,622
We've got a representative from Arts Collaborative and that's Regina.

93
00:04:13,082 --> 00:04:13,763
Hi, Regina.

94
00:04:14,144 --> 00:04:14,885
Nice to meet you.

95
00:04:15,145 --> 00:04:16,987
I don't think you were here last time I was on.

96
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:23,962
Yes, I wasn't able to make the last meeting, but Alan took over.

97
00:04:24,362 --> 00:04:25,562
He was our past chair.

98
00:04:25,622 --> 00:04:29,443
He does a great job as usual, so we knew we were in good hands.

99
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:31,744
Yeah, that's great.

100
00:04:32,184 --> 00:04:39,566
We have, I guess, three events, three one-day licenses that you're applying for, so if you could just give us a little information.

101
00:04:39,606 --> 00:04:41,506
I mean, if they're all basically the same.

102
00:04:42,107 --> 00:04:43,867
Yeah, they more or less are.

103
00:04:44,747 --> 00:04:46,788
So if you're not familiar, we're an arts center.

104
00:04:47,548 --> 00:04:50,170
first physical community arts center on Mystic Ave.

105
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:59,175
We just opened in January and we just acquired our alcohol insurance and so now I'm just starting to offer some beer and some wine at our closings and openings.

106
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:16,405
So the one on the 7th, it's a Thursday evening, it's a closing reception and then we have one, it's an opening reception on the 16th and then for the 17th it's an open studio so the public will be able to come in and see the artists at work.

107
00:05:17,071 --> 00:05:18,413
And so those are all really similar.

108
00:05:18,533 --> 00:05:25,982
It'll be a cash bar, not expecting anything too big, but just wanting to have some options open for Argus.

109
00:05:27,598 --> 00:05:29,159
Okay, great.

110
00:05:29,819 --> 00:05:41,705
I just did notice on the first event, the one on the 7th, yeah.

111
00:05:41,825 --> 00:05:45,507
There was just no address on page with the very top.

112
00:05:45,527 --> 00:05:46,868
That was just a typo.

113
00:05:47,488 --> 00:05:48,669
It is on 162 Mystic Ave, so.

114
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:53,853
Yeah, that's what I kind of just figured.

115
00:05:54,313 --> 00:05:57,916
I looked at the other two and they were both those as well.

116
00:05:57,936 --> 00:05:58,797
Okay.

117
00:05:59,318 --> 00:06:04,102
I trust that you where you stated you do have the insurance liability.

118
00:06:05,003 --> 00:06:08,726
I trust that the city has the area has that on file where you were here.

119
00:06:08,746 --> 00:06:11,188
Yes, they have it for a year till next September.

120
00:06:12,049 --> 00:06:12,629
Okay, great.

121
00:06:12,929 --> 00:06:14,130
That's that's terrific.

122
00:06:14,511 --> 00:06:16,753
And let's see.

123
00:06:18,143 --> 00:06:21,305
We have a diagram with the first one.

124
00:06:21,905 --> 00:06:22,145
Yeah.

125
00:06:23,306 --> 00:06:32,110
Should have a really similar one because it's going to be the same setup where the public is in the main space, that alcove is where the art is, and the bar will be to the right side.

126
00:06:35,872 --> 00:06:36,812
Okay.

127
00:06:37,432 --> 00:06:42,094
You have a bartender that you'll be doing the serving?

128
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:42,955
Yeah.

129
00:06:43,815 --> 00:06:46,877
I have tip certification, so I'll be on site for all three of these events.

130
00:06:47,727 --> 00:06:48,447
Oh, great.

131
00:06:48,747 --> 00:06:52,769
So it'll be myself, probably, or our other TIPSA certified staff giving them out.

132
00:06:53,749 --> 00:06:54,429
Fantastic.

133
00:06:54,489 --> 00:06:57,450
And you're aware that you are a non-profit.

134
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:10,034
So at any time, besides being no charge to you folks, you do have the ability to serve all alcohol being a non-profit.

135
00:07:10,154 --> 00:07:15,535
If at any time you want to do that, it's available to you as well.

136
00:07:15,716 --> 00:07:16,156
That's great.

137
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,096
That's awesome to know.

138
00:07:18,183 --> 00:07:19,324
Mm-hmm.

139
00:07:19,344 --> 00:07:20,405
Thanks.

140
00:07:20,605 --> 00:07:22,847
Allen, do you have any questions for Regina?

141
00:07:22,927 --> 00:07:24,248
No, I do not.

142
00:07:24,628 --> 00:07:30,593
I looked through, you're right, just a little typo on the first one, but the others are fine.

143
00:07:30,653 --> 00:07:35,577
We have the insurance, we have the diagram, so we have a good idea of the layout.

144
00:07:36,858 --> 00:07:38,460
So I'm fine with that.

145
00:07:39,561 --> 00:07:42,043
I have no questions, pretty straightforward.

146
00:07:42,063 --> 00:07:45,966
Bobby, do you mind if I make a motion, I lump them all together?

147
00:07:46,772 --> 00:07:47,613
Sure, that'll be fine.

148
00:07:47,873 --> 00:07:48,773
Okay, so I motioned.

149
00:07:48,793 --> 00:07:51,215
Can I just ask Regina one quick question?

150
00:07:51,235 --> 00:07:52,015
Oh, sure, sorry.

151
00:07:53,156 --> 00:07:55,337
You had a similar event last month, correct?

152
00:07:55,817 --> 00:07:57,758
We had a similar event on Saturday, actually.

153
00:07:57,778 --> 00:07:59,739
It was the first time we ever got a one-day permit.

154
00:07:59,799 --> 00:08:02,221
It was very smooth, and I was grateful.

155
00:08:02,581 --> 00:08:02,901
Thank you.

156
00:08:02,921 --> 00:08:05,843
That's what I wanted to ask, just to see how it went, how you guys did.

157
00:08:05,863 --> 00:08:06,663
It went really well.

158
00:08:07,224 --> 00:08:08,324
Good, that's good.

159
00:08:08,344 --> 00:08:08,965
That's a good thing.

160
00:08:09,145 --> 00:08:10,886
Okay, so you're familiar with it?

161
00:08:11,686 --> 00:08:11,826
Yeah.

162
00:08:13,684 --> 00:08:25,699
No, I was going to say Regina to I know you were on the last meeting and we were telling the folks from the library that if you ever have an event and you have a licensed caterer, you really don't a 1 day.

163
00:08:25,799 --> 00:08:25,960
Yeah.

164
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:26,620
So that.

165
00:08:29,243 --> 00:08:32,064
So that was a good teachable moment for Joe.

166
00:08:33,725 --> 00:08:36,526
All right, so Bobby, do you mind if I make a motion for all three?

167
00:08:36,546 --> 00:08:37,947
No, go right ahead.

168
00:08:37,967 --> 00:08:41,568
All right, I can see the trash truck coming, so it will probably get loud.

169
00:08:42,268 --> 00:08:50,332
All right, so I make a motion to approve the one-day license for three separate events.

170
00:08:50,352 --> 00:08:51,732
The event to be held on 11-7, 11-16, 11-17.

171
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,700
And I hope everything goes well.

172
00:09:01,001 --> 00:09:02,801
So that's my motion.

173
00:09:03,742 --> 00:09:05,202
I'll second that motion.

174
00:09:05,562 --> 00:09:06,583
All those in favor?

175
00:09:07,103 --> 00:09:07,243
Aye.

176
00:09:08,363 --> 00:09:09,283
All those opposed?

177
00:09:09,724 --> 00:09:13,265
Hearing and seeing none, your application has been approved.

178
00:09:13,669 --> 00:09:14,910
Thank you so much.

179
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:16,451
All right, best of luck.

180
00:09:16,471 --> 00:09:25,078
I hear that Javier had given you kind of a quick- We did, we had a really helpful meeting.

181
00:09:25,359 --> 00:09:29,122
Yeah, just so I can understand, so I don't cause any more emergency meetings.

182
00:09:29,162 --> 00:09:30,563
I'll be prepared now every month.

183
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:38,109
I understand when I need one and when I don't, like the catering and we're for private and we're not selling anything, just basics like that.

184
00:09:38,129 --> 00:09:38,790
She was really helpful.

185
00:09:39,522 --> 00:09:40,262
Yeah, no, that's great.

186
00:09:40,383 --> 00:09:42,904
Anytime you can reach out to Daria, she'll answer your questions.

187
00:09:42,924 --> 00:09:45,746
Just give her a little bit of leeway, you know, before the meeting.

188
00:09:46,126 --> 00:09:47,146
Wealth of information.

189
00:09:47,186 --> 00:09:57,052
Yeah, I just said, you know, Regina, I hated to say no the last time, but I just, you know, we just don't want to violate the state open meeting laws and have someone point the finger at us.

190
00:09:57,152 --> 00:10:00,094
And so, but we're able to accommodate you.

191
00:10:00,374 --> 00:10:00,574
Yeah.

192
00:10:00,754 --> 00:10:00,914
Yeah.

193
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:01,975
I appreciate it so much.

194
00:10:02,075 --> 00:10:02,435
Thank you.

195
00:10:02,876 --> 00:10:03,176
Cool.

196
00:10:03,256 --> 00:10:03,496
Great.

197
00:10:03,676 --> 00:10:03,936
All right.

198
00:10:03,956 --> 00:10:04,396
Thank you.

199
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:11,663
And okay, we had a couple of things, Alan, you got a few minutes to spend, Dari.

200
00:10:11,683 --> 00:10:15,546
Dari, do you have any news for us?

201
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:20,910
Did we reach out to KP for that one day?

202
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:25,973
Yes, I reached out, but haven't heard yet.

203
00:10:26,053 --> 00:10:30,316
But I do have another question about

204
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:36,143
Ardor dining for Alta Cuba.

205
00:10:36,684 --> 00:10:44,452
Alvaro wants to continue, not to serve on the road, I guess, but on the sidewalk.

206
00:10:44,472 --> 00:10:45,252
He has seats.

207
00:10:46,394 --> 00:10:49,557
So the city is fine with it, but

208
00:10:51,745 --> 00:11:06,249
If the city is fine with it, and as long as you agree with me on this, Alan, as far as we go, we get to grant that every year.

209
00:11:06,289 --> 00:11:08,249
We don't have to go through the state anymore.

210
00:11:08,889 --> 00:11:20,392
The city sends out their department heads and all of their inspections pass with the building department, the zoning board, everybody.

211
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:25,136
We're okay with them serving alcohol out there.

212
00:11:25,236 --> 00:11:30,802
I don't think we need to get a alteration of premise because it's not really a permanent structure.

213
00:11:30,842 --> 00:11:31,482
Correct, Alan?

214
00:11:32,023 --> 00:11:32,443
Correct.

215
00:11:33,204 --> 00:11:36,267
I don't think there are any limitations either.

216
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:37,952
I'm sorry, what was that?

217
00:11:38,592 --> 00:11:42,256
I don't think there's any date limitations for the seasonal dining.

218
00:11:42,356 --> 00:11:45,399
I was looking at it too, and I didn't see any date limitations.

219
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:45,759
Yeah.

220
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:47,161
Because I thought the same thing.

221
00:11:47,221 --> 00:11:51,905
I was like, I feel like there's a date limitation, but I looked through it, and I didn't see any.

222
00:11:52,325 --> 00:11:54,187
And I think Mother Nature will take care of that.

223
00:11:54,267 --> 00:11:55,729
At some point, it'll just be too cold.

224
00:11:55,769 --> 00:11:56,049
Exactly.

225
00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:00,952
And you're right to your 1st thought.

226
00:12:01,852 --> 00:12:06,254
As long as the city, it meets all the codes and there are no violations.

227
00:12:06,374 --> 00:12:08,615
I. Yeah, we're, we're fine with that.

228
00:12:09,717 --> 00:12:11,578
Yeah, there's not a problem there.

229
00:12:11,738 --> 00:12:16,882
And it's not, you know, I'm sure like, like you said, the weather will, will take care of it.

230
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:23,226
I mean, sidewalk heaters or something, maybe, I don't know, for a little while, but then yeah.

231
00:12:23,706 --> 00:12:29,349
Yeah, I think he just wanted mainly for the show, Chevalier shows, and then it's been beautiful this weekend.

232
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:32,431
Yeah, he just wanted, you know, for the crowd.

233
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:33,072
So yeah.

234
00:12:33,632 --> 00:12:34,293
Yeah.

235
00:12:34,433 --> 00:12:35,754
No, not a problem with that at all.

236
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:36,775
Yeah.

237
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:41,059
And what Daria and I was speaking about yesterday, I just stopped in there.

238
00:12:42,741 --> 00:12:56,374
When I heard about the three licensees that were looking for a extension for New Year's time extension to go until like, I believe, one o'clock.

239
00:12:59,978 --> 00:13:05,683
It bothered me a little bit, especially about Bocelli's because they don't have an entertainment license.

240
00:13:07,284 --> 00:13:25,860
I knew there was some issues there for the reason why they didn't apply for a new entertainment license because what I found out yesterday, the reason being I went and spoke with the building commissioner and he said that

241
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:36,998
If we issue an entertainment license, it'll change their category of their business from a restaurant to a nightclub.

242
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:52,627
So if they leave things the way they are, they can still have functions down in the basement as a restaurant, as long as there's no entertainment, bands, TVs, whatever.

243
00:13:52,647 --> 00:13:53,728
I see.

244
00:13:54,847 --> 00:13:57,331
And I said, OK, well, that's good.

245
00:13:57,411 --> 00:14:03,121
I said, so if they want to come before us and have food available,

246
00:14:04,145 --> 00:14:06,346
He says, we don't have a problem till one o'clock.

247
00:14:06,406 --> 00:14:10,829
And he said, yeah, no, that is not a problem as long as there's no music or entertainment.

248
00:14:10,889 --> 00:14:11,829
No entertainment.

249
00:14:11,949 --> 00:14:12,170
Yeah.

250
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:13,911
So I says, OK, that's fine.

251
00:14:14,831 --> 00:14:23,856
So then I went and checked with the city clerk because that was bugging me, because I don't know how long their license goes until that.

252
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:29,880
I don't know if you've got it on the record, but their actual license to serve, they one of the

253
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:33,302
1 o'clock ones, or no?

254
00:14:33,783 --> 00:14:35,224
Let me look.

255
00:14:35,884 --> 00:14:45,552
Because if not, then the city... No, I don't think so, because if she asked for 1 a.m., I don't think they're till 1 a.m.

256
00:14:46,293 --> 00:14:47,494
Let me just check real quick.

257
00:14:47,614 --> 00:14:50,757
Let me just check on what I did last year for renewals.

258
00:14:51,537 --> 00:14:53,139
Because we've got a 1 a.m.

259
00:14:53,219 --> 00:14:57,422
on Oasis and on Great American Beer Hall, the other two that are looking, correct?

260
00:14:57,502 --> 00:14:58,984
Yeah, so I'm wondering why...

261
00:15:00,756 --> 00:15:03,337
why Oasis would even look if they're a tell of 1 a.m.

262
00:15:03,417 --> 00:15:03,817
anyways.

263
00:15:05,078 --> 00:15:09,680
They're probably just looking for us to extend the liquor license out to 1 a.m.

264
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:15,863
We can only extend it out as far as the common Vic says.

265
00:15:16,243 --> 00:15:22,086
So if the Oasis got extension of hours, they may not already be extended to one.

266
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:25,408
That's the reason why they would ask.

267
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:25,828
OK.

268
00:15:26,616 --> 00:15:30,919
Now, that's why I look for 2 o'clock, but the city won't do 2 o'clock.

269
00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:32,360
Their limit is 1.

270
00:15:34,201 --> 00:15:35,962
And the thing is, Alan is the.

271
00:15:38,692 --> 00:15:41,674
The clerk was very, he had his heels dug in pretty good.

272
00:15:42,175 --> 00:15:45,837
And he, I actually, he says, where did you get that information?

273
00:15:45,877 --> 00:15:49,540
I says, I get it from the building commissioner, Scott.

274
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:50,821
I says, you can call him.

275
00:15:50,941 --> 00:15:54,463
Because he says, I had a conversation with him the other day and that's not what he said.

276
00:15:54,483 --> 00:15:57,606
I said, well, you can call him while I'm standing here in your office.

277
00:15:57,826 --> 00:16:00,188
And he did, and they kind of,

278
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:02,921
went back and forth a little bit.

279
00:16:03,602 --> 00:16:18,187
And what the city clerk requires, even for a one-day extension of hours, they want the licensee to go before the city council to extend the hours for that one day.

280
00:16:18,207 --> 00:16:23,669
And it's like an 8-, 10-, 12-page thing that they have to fill out.

281
00:16:24,869 --> 00:16:29,831
And before they go to city council, it's got to be advertised in a paper for two weeks.

282
00:16:30,311 --> 00:16:37,393
He says it takes about six weeks to do it before they do the advertising, they get on the agenda and everything else.

283
00:16:37,433 --> 00:16:40,134
He says they're not going to have time before New Year's.

284
00:16:40,214 --> 00:16:41,815
If they do, it's going to be pretty close.

285
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:42,655
Yeah.

286
00:16:43,357 --> 00:16:53,603
You know, I'm counting eight weeks, unless I'm counting wrong, but I think we can give them the option if they want to attempt it.

287
00:16:54,483 --> 00:17:04,289
But what I would strongly suggest to them, or to anybody else who's gonna go before the council to get an extension for one day, get an extension for the whole year.

288
00:17:04,629 --> 00:17:08,611
Just change your license time to 1 a.m.

289
00:17:08,931 --> 00:17:11,993
Seven days a week, 1 a.m., you don't have to worry about it.

290
00:17:12,613 --> 00:17:21,221
And according to the city's rules, all alcohol licensees can operate from 11 a.m.

291
00:17:21,842 --> 00:17:22,642
to 1 a.m.

292
00:17:22,923 --> 00:17:26,806
Monday through Saturday, and from noon to 1 a.m.

293
00:17:27,066 --> 00:17:27,687
on Sunday.

294
00:17:31,882 --> 00:17:41,544
we want to invoke the 33B, which allows them to come in a couple hours earlier on a Sunday, like for that Patriots game that was just on a special event.

295
00:17:42,384 --> 00:17:45,205
Somebody does brunches, we can grant it for the whole year.

296
00:17:45,965 --> 00:17:52,366
But they'll probably have to do the same thing, go before the city council and through the city clerks.

297
00:17:52,466 --> 00:17:54,227
There's a fee, they have to pay a fee.

298
00:17:54,287 --> 00:17:55,547
So you're gonna pay a fee?

299
00:17:56,107 --> 00:17:57,587
Just get them changed for the whole year.

300
00:17:57,727 --> 00:17:59,428
Now we don't run into this problem anymore.

301
00:17:59,448 --> 00:18:01,408
I don't think anybody will,

302
00:18:02,723 --> 00:18:06,767
I don't think anybody will say anything about it or have any issue with it, but.

303
00:18:08,889 --> 00:18:13,193
You know, Bobby, when you explain it, it sounds very, very straightforward and simple.

304
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:22,181
Is there a way to get back to both Challis and Oasis just to let them know that that's the policy or that's the procedure?

305
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:25,380
Well, if Oasis has a 1 a.m.

306
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:31,083
license, if they do, then it's a moot point.

307
00:18:31,764 --> 00:18:40,408
If Bocelli does not, they gotta have, I mean, we can let them know what the... Bocelli don't, yeah.

308
00:18:40,748 --> 00:18:47,512
They don't let them know what we found, but we should strongly encourage them to contact the city clerk.

309
00:18:48,353 --> 00:18:48,553
Yeah.

310
00:18:49,134 --> 00:18:51,515
And we will let them know what the rules are.

311
00:18:52,236 --> 00:19:01,441
OK, if you're OK by the city clerk and the council, the rules are you got to have food out until 1 a.m.

312
00:19:02,022 --> 00:19:03,643
when liquor is being served.

313
00:19:04,523 --> 00:19:07,065
And also you cannot have any entertainment.

314
00:19:07,285 --> 00:19:11,888
You can have party hats, you can have the blowers, you can have the happy new year, whatever you want.

315
00:19:12,028 --> 00:19:15,130
But there's no music, no entertainment.

316
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:15,490
Right.

317
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:16,291
OK.

318
00:19:16,311 --> 00:19:17,192
So it's kind of

319
00:19:18,735 --> 00:19:24,599
Because in not that we're being prejudiced against them or anything, it's because you don't have an entertainment license.

320
00:19:24,619 --> 00:19:25,019
Correct.

321
00:19:25,239 --> 00:19:25,599
Correct.

322
00:19:25,699 --> 00:19:26,900
That's a license.

323
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:27,841
Correct.

324
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:28,381
Problem.

325
00:19:28,421 --> 00:19:28,641
Right.

326
00:19:29,321 --> 00:19:34,465
And they don't have the entertainment license because for whatever reason, it doesn't meet the.

327
00:19:35,305 --> 00:19:38,188
The newer codes, the standard codes, right?

328
00:19:38,748 --> 00:19:39,529
Yes.

329
00:19:39,949 --> 00:19:44,833
It violates the ordinance.

330
00:19:45,113 --> 00:19:49,977
It turns the business description from a restaurant to a nightclub.

331
00:19:50,418 --> 00:19:50,738
I see.

332
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:51,919
It's entertainment.

333
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:56,543
Technically, all these places that we give entertainment licenses to,

334
00:19:57,203 --> 00:19:59,303
considered nightclub category, I guess.

335
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:03,484
That was right from Scott from the building department.

336
00:20:04,884 --> 00:20:13,206
And one of the other inspectors who was involved with this when Bocelli's was taken over by the new owners, he was standing there as well.

337
00:20:13,246 --> 00:20:16,487
He says, we already really looked into this hard.

338
00:20:16,987 --> 00:20:22,608
And I says, well, I kind of figured that was the case where they never applied for an entertainment license.

339
00:20:23,228 --> 00:20:24,088
They could get one.

340
00:20:24,748 --> 00:20:40,544
if the building owner sprinkles the whole building right and brings it up to code for up to code that type of business but he's not going to do that i'm sure okay um so it makes sense yeah that's kind of when you know what all i could see was

341
00:20:41,485 --> 00:20:46,050
another station nightclub via Godfrey or another coconut grove.

342
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:51,015
I mean, you know, the odds are minimal, but something happens.

343
00:20:51,215 --> 00:21:00,384
It's just like, you know, I mean, it was, it's difficult to get out of that basement if you don't know where the other exits are.

344
00:21:00,984 --> 00:21:04,428
I mean, everybody knows the main one that comes in from upstairs dining room.

345
00:21:05,108 --> 00:21:07,992
But there's another one by the bathroom that goes up the pike.

346
00:21:08,152 --> 00:21:10,935
And then there's another one I heard that goes up through the kitchen.

347
00:21:10,955 --> 00:21:22,587
I just, I mean, unless the building department and the fire department say that, yeah, it's okay for a night, then I...

348
00:21:24,889 --> 00:21:28,271
You know, I wouldn't be okay with it unless they said it was all right.

349
00:21:28,411 --> 00:21:38,098
And even if they said it was all right, it's still got to go by the city clerk and the city council for the hours to get raised to 1 am.

350
00:21:38,418 --> 00:21:38,578
Yeah.

351
00:21:41,373 --> 00:21:43,034
So that's logical.

352
00:21:43,354 --> 00:21:44,475
Yeah, very logical.

353
00:21:44,996 --> 00:21:55,744
I think, Daria, you know, if we get the message out to Bocelli's so they can start the ball rolling, because if it does take six to eight weeks, they're running out of time.

354
00:21:56,605 --> 00:21:56,825
Yeah.

355
00:21:56,925 --> 00:22:03,991
Well, that's what I was going to suggest to Daria if you want to reach out to her and just explain that.

356
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:06,293
If she has any questions, she can give me a call.

357
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:12,284
Or whatever, and I explain it a little more detail, but we definitely want her to.

358
00:22:12,304 --> 00:22:16,748
To go before the city clerk.

359
00:22:17,849 --> 00:22:22,073
Just to make sure that she's doing what they want and, um.

360
00:22:23,566 --> 00:22:34,889
and do it ASAP, but I would also wait until you hear back from KP Law with the question that is this a MedFed ordinance?

361
00:22:35,589 --> 00:22:47,972
I mean, you know, last time, you know, we went through with the club licenses, it's, you know, the building department, this was before Scott got there, but they said that,

362
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,841
they couldn't have their licenses till 1 a.m.

363
00:22:50,881 --> 00:22:53,782
and it was completely wrong when it was looked into.

364
00:22:54,662 --> 00:23:13,090
So, you know, I'm not saying they're wrong, but it may be a good idea just for KP to take a look, and especially where it was advised by Ralph at the ABCC to check with your legal counsel, the city's legal counsel, before you give them the okay.

365
00:23:13,997 --> 00:23:14,658
That's what we're doing.

366
00:23:15,358 --> 00:23:22,303
And we kind of know this is the rules, but let's make sure that this is really the rules.

367
00:23:22,803 --> 00:23:23,284
I don't know.

368
00:23:23,324 --> 00:23:23,984
Yeah, I know.

369
00:23:24,004 --> 00:23:24,665
Makes sense.

370
00:23:24,805 --> 00:23:25,565
Makes sense, Bobby.

371
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:27,367
Makes sense.

372
00:23:28,968 --> 00:23:30,889
So I think that's about all we had.

373
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,211
There was nothing else pending, right?

374
00:23:33,671 --> 00:23:35,472
One question, though, just to clarify.

375
00:23:37,941 --> 00:23:43,646
Should I clarify that they cannot have entertainment at the Bocelli's?

376
00:23:44,086 --> 00:23:45,947
Bocelli's cannot have entertainment.

377
00:23:46,047 --> 00:23:51,532
Okay, so I think that needs, maybe needs to be said to them too because they might be doing it.

378
00:23:51,732 --> 00:23:52,613
I don't, I mean, I don't know.

379
00:23:52,653 --> 00:23:53,413
I'm just assuming.

380
00:23:53,433 --> 00:23:56,416
If they're doing entertainment.

381
00:23:57,217 --> 00:24:00,740
We don't know about it unless there's a complaint filed.

382
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:09,327
And then law enforcement, our law enforcement, we notify Lieutenant Lockowitz, have him investigated.

383
00:24:10,228 --> 00:24:17,233
And then if there's an issue that there is, in fact, entertainment down there, we'd have to put a stop.

384
00:24:17,253 --> 00:24:17,714
Hold on.

385
00:24:18,014 --> 00:24:18,854
I lost you for a second.

386
00:24:18,894 --> 00:24:19,155
Hold on.

387
00:24:19,175 --> 00:24:20,736
Oh, OK.

388
00:24:24,999 --> 00:24:25,360
Hold on.

389
00:24:26,087 --> 00:24:26,567
That's okay.

390
00:24:27,327 --> 00:24:27,868
Take your time.

391
00:24:33,769 --> 00:24:35,650
I don't know why I can't find my mouse right now.

392
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:39,291
Oh my God.

393
00:24:39,931 --> 00:24:40,911
Put out a little cheese.

394
00:24:44,952 --> 00:24:45,972
We'll find them real quick.

395
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:53,230
Why?

396
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:59,154
I was, I was playing around with my computer and it went over to my iPad right next to the computer.

397
00:24:59,214 --> 00:24:59,835
I don't know why.

398
00:24:59,855 --> 00:25:01,756
Oh, that's funny.

399
00:25:01,996 --> 00:25:03,757
We just blew a few.

400
00:25:04,437 --> 00:25:08,040
So that's why I lost you guys for a second.

401
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:09,341
Oh my God.

402
00:25:09,581 --> 00:25:11,462
You're breaking up and freezing a little bit too.

403
00:25:12,323 --> 00:25:12,623
Yeah.

404
00:25:12,763 --> 00:25:14,524
So everything is turned off at the moment.

405
00:25:14,544 --> 00:25:15,645
Okay.

406
00:25:23,863 --> 00:25:26,445
Yeah, well, a few so.

407
00:25:27,806 --> 00:25:29,648
Give us a 2nd, make it time.

408
00:25:34,805 --> 00:25:40,167
I got until 317 when Apple's supposed to call me, I got a new phone.

409
00:25:41,768 --> 00:25:46,229
And I was trying to, Cheryl's phone went through perfect.

410
00:25:46,329 --> 00:25:52,932
My phone was, for some reason, I couldn't remember a password to the app store where you get all your apps from.

411
00:25:53,272 --> 00:25:54,613
It's different than the Apple ID.

412
00:25:55,533 --> 00:25:55,733
Yeah.

413
00:25:56,133 --> 00:25:59,574
And you get a 16, a 16.

414
00:25:59,814 --> 00:26:00,774
Yeah, exactly.

415
00:26:03,035 --> 00:26:04,935
We haven't had new phones in six, seven years.

416
00:26:05,315 --> 00:26:10,036
So this new one with the Apple and Jensen, blah, blah, blah.

417
00:26:11,497 --> 00:26:13,257
But it's just like, they didn't believe me.

418
00:26:13,537 --> 00:26:20,539
I said, well, we're in an Apple store and, you know, it's, this is from an Apple phone and blah, this is the accountant.

419
00:26:21,219 --> 00:26:21,399
Nope.

420
00:26:21,719 --> 00:26:23,560
We're going to shut you down for several days.

421
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,580
They shut us down seven,

422
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:28,445
I think at four o'clock on Saturday.

423
00:26:30,138 --> 00:26:31,518
Saturday or Sunday, Sunday.

424
00:26:32,118 --> 00:26:40,280
And I still haven't been able to log into that account and half of my apps don't work because I purchased them out of the app store and I can't get access to them.

425
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:47,702
So they sent me an email saying, somebody will call you at 317 on Wednesday the 20th.

426
00:26:48,002 --> 00:26:53,443
It's like, this is high security stuff, man.

427
00:26:55,884 --> 00:26:58,405
But anyways, so I got until 317.

428
00:27:02,486 --> 00:27:03,206
Daria, are you back?

429
00:27:03,226 --> 00:27:03,767
Can you hear us?

430
00:27:07,248 --> 00:27:08,189
No, probably not.

431
00:27:08,809 --> 00:27:20,854
I wonder if she wants to stop it and start it again.

432
00:27:21,975 --> 00:27:22,375
I wonder.

433
00:27:22,855 --> 00:27:23,735
That might make sense.

434
00:27:23,755 --> 00:27:25,536
I don't know.

435
00:27:25,576 --> 00:27:26,177
Can you do that?

436
00:27:26,197 --> 00:27:27,057
Why don't you hang up?

437
00:27:27,921 --> 00:27:29,262
I'm not a big Zoomer.

438
00:27:29,422 --> 00:27:32,045
I don't know too much about how to work this foolish thing.

439
00:27:32,485 --> 00:27:32,766
Yeah.

440
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:41,994
Yeah, I think something's freezing up on her end because see your picture?

441
00:27:42,675 --> 00:27:45,117
Yeah, yeah.

442
00:27:45,637 --> 00:27:48,060
I always say technology is wonderful when it works.

443
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:49,741
Yeah, exactly.

444
00:27:51,222 --> 00:27:51,683
Exactly.

445
00:27:54,037 --> 00:27:56,599
I think you had to shut off the video one time too, right?

446
00:27:56,859 --> 00:27:58,000
So we could get your voice.

447
00:27:59,221 --> 00:28:00,202
Something was going on.

448
00:28:00,522 --> 00:28:00,742
Yeah.

449
00:28:04,205 --> 00:28:05,025
Any trips planned?

450
00:28:05,886 --> 00:28:06,566
Can you hear me now?

451
00:28:06,586 --> 00:28:09,008
Oh, I can hear you, yeah.

452
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:10,930
Can you hear us?

453
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:12,471
Yes, I can.

454
00:28:13,211 --> 00:28:14,192
Okay, great.

455
00:28:16,034 --> 00:28:17,515
Okay, that's the thing.

456
00:28:19,096 --> 00:28:20,397
Turn off the picture, that's all.

457
00:28:22,697 --> 00:28:29,781
So I think we left it where we were just, before we do anything, let's get an opinion from KP Law.

458
00:28:29,981 --> 00:28:31,222
I think that's kind of where we were.

459
00:28:31,242 --> 00:28:32,142
Yeah.

460
00:28:32,482 --> 00:28:32,662
Yep.

461
00:28:33,283 --> 00:28:34,323
That's the last thing I heard.

462
00:28:34,343 --> 00:28:35,484
Yeah.

463
00:28:35,644 --> 00:28:47,150
And then after we get the answer from KP Law, hopefully it'll be within a day or two, you can reach out to Bocelli's and let them know exactly what we're doing.

464
00:28:48,002 --> 00:28:51,404
Because in a sense, I'm reaching out to them, tell them to do all this stuff.

465
00:28:51,484 --> 00:28:53,445
If KP Law says something different.

466
00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:54,445
Yeah, they don't have to do it.

467
00:28:54,505 --> 00:28:55,065
Exactly.

468
00:28:55,105 --> 00:28:55,346
Right.

469
00:28:56,286 --> 00:28:56,746
Right.

470
00:28:58,167 --> 00:28:58,447
Okay.

471
00:28:59,067 --> 00:28:59,708
Okay, cool.

472
00:29:01,789 --> 00:29:02,229
Great.

473
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:05,951
Mr. Chairman, should I make a motion to adjourn?

474
00:29:07,091 --> 00:29:07,331
Sure.

475
00:29:07,351 --> 00:29:08,372
Are you all set, Daria?

476
00:29:09,067 --> 00:29:12,889
Yeah, yeah, I think I didn't know if you had any other questions with that.

477
00:29:13,409 --> 00:29:14,910
No, I think that was it.

478
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:18,151
Okay, so I make a motion to adjourn today's meeting.

479
00:29:18,271 --> 00:29:18,391
It's 1.30.

480
00:29:18,511 --> 00:29:21,933
Okay, all those in favor.

481
00:29:22,373 --> 00:29:22,493
Aye.

482
00:29:24,494 --> 00:29:26,195
Hearing and saying none, the ayes have it.

483
00:29:26,635 --> 00:29:27,055
Very good.

484
00:29:27,235 --> 00:29:27,835
Thank you.

485
00:29:27,875 --> 00:29:29,276
Good to see you, Bobby.
