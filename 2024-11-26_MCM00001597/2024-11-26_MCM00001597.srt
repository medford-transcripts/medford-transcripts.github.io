1
00:00:00,071 --> 00:00:02,852
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, we may as well get started.

2
00:00:04,232 --> 00:00:14,174
[SPEAKER_03]: The emergency public meeting of the City of Medford Liquor License Commission for 8-23-24 will come to order.

3
00:00:16,115 --> 00:00:18,415
[SPEAKER_03]: We do have an agenda for this meeting.

4
00:00:19,256 --> 00:00:26,397
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't think, we don't need to do the minutes of the last meeting, correct, Daria?

5
00:00:26,437 --> 00:00:27,918
[SPEAKER_03]: We can wait till the next monthly meeting?

6
00:00:27,938 --> 00:00:28,898
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, next month, yep.

7
00:00:29,386 --> 00:00:29,947
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, great.

8
00:00:31,728 --> 00:00:37,413
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so why don't we get right into that then?

9
00:00:38,554 --> 00:00:39,775
[SPEAKER_03]: Get right into the agenda.

10
00:00:39,815 --> 00:00:42,797
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll go right down the list.

11
00:00:42,877 --> 00:00:47,621
[SPEAKER_03]: Representative from the City of Medford will present for a one-day license application.

12
00:00:47,641 --> 00:00:50,023
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's you, Lisa, correct?

13
00:00:50,395 --> 00:00:52,196
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, yes, thank you so much.

14
00:00:52,617 --> 00:00:55,339
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for having this this emergency meeting.

15
00:00:55,379 --> 00:01:01,143
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very sorry that you know you had to do it off schedule and we do appreciate it.

16
00:01:03,205 --> 00:01:03,765
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

17
00:01:04,406 --> 00:01:16,855
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, so we are requesting a one day license for Medford Brewing Company to be the beer garden at the upcoming pumpkin float, which is this Saturday at Wrights Pond from 6 to 8 30 PM.

18
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:21,803
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done this for the last, I think, four years now.

19
00:01:21,823 --> 00:01:30,815
[SPEAKER_00]: I think three of it has had a beer garden, and we have it in a specific area at the pond.

20
00:01:30,855 --> 00:01:32,817
[SPEAKER_00]: It's right in front of the bathhouse area.

21
00:01:37,625 --> 00:01:38,005
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry?

22
00:01:38,245 --> 00:01:39,746
[SPEAKER_04]: You used to call it the snack bar.

23
00:01:39,986 --> 00:01:42,608
[SPEAKER_00]: The snack bar, yeah.

24
00:01:43,848 --> 00:01:44,669
[SPEAKER_00]: Right in front of that.

25
00:01:45,749 --> 00:01:48,731
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's cordoned off with like riot fencing.

26
00:01:49,251 --> 00:01:53,233
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, people can't just kind of sweep in.

27
00:01:53,854 --> 00:01:57,196
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to literally enter from just one specific area.

28
00:01:57,216 --> 00:02:00,657
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have like no alcohol beyond this point signs.

29
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,441
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's about it.

30
00:02:04,461 --> 00:02:07,865
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, they're going to be serving beer and like mulled wine.

31
00:02:07,885 --> 00:02:07,966
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.

32
00:02:12,127 --> 00:02:14,188
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you folks do this every year.

33
00:02:14,248 --> 00:02:19,409
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess the last couple of three years that I've been on, we've had no problems.

34
00:02:20,789 --> 00:02:21,830
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a pretty smooth thing.

35
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:26,951
[SPEAKER_03]: And as you say, it just kind of got bypassed in the shuffle.

36
00:02:27,011 --> 00:02:30,532
[SPEAKER_03]: But we don't mind when there's a situation like this.

37
00:02:30,592 --> 00:02:33,392
[SPEAKER_03]: We can ensure a special meeting.

38
00:02:33,432 --> 00:02:34,333
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not a problem at all.

39
00:02:36,444 --> 00:02:38,306
[SPEAKER_03]: Alan, any questions?

40
00:02:38,566 --> 00:02:40,488
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, I'm familiar with the event.

41
00:02:40,528 --> 00:02:41,589
[SPEAKER_04]: I grew up up the Heights.

42
00:02:41,669 --> 00:02:43,611
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm very familiar with Wright's Palm.

43
00:02:43,651 --> 00:02:47,815
[SPEAKER_04]: We used to sneak in there after hours, all that stuff.

44
00:02:48,296 --> 00:02:50,438
[SPEAKER_04]: But no, it's a great event.

45
00:02:50,698 --> 00:02:54,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Lisa was telling me about it, because I was asking Daria if the pumpkins float.

46
00:02:55,363 --> 00:02:57,124
[SPEAKER_04]: So they were kind of giving me an overview.

47
00:02:57,925 --> 00:03:00,326
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm perfectly fine with it.

48
00:03:00,986 --> 00:03:11,711
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to make a motion to approve the one-day license for October 26, which is Sunday from 6-8.30 PM.

49
00:03:12,071 --> 00:03:13,631
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you do have 700 guests.

50
00:03:13,671 --> 00:03:14,832
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be fantastic.

51
00:03:15,132 --> 00:03:17,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

52
00:03:18,473 --> 00:03:22,375
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said, that'd be my motion to accept the one-day license for Sunday.

53
00:03:23,671 --> 00:03:25,774
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, and I will second that.

54
00:03:26,315 --> 00:03:28,218
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor, aye.

55
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:28,579
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

56
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,061
[SPEAKER_03]: Very good.

57
00:03:30,121 --> 00:03:31,043
[SPEAKER_03]: It is approved.

58
00:03:31,834 --> 00:03:32,214
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.

59
00:03:32,274 --> 00:03:32,674
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

60
00:03:32,694 --> 00:03:35,696
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to make one thing.

61
00:03:35,756 --> 00:03:36,656
[SPEAKER_00]: It's for Saturday.

62
00:03:36,676 --> 00:03:37,876
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm sorry.

63
00:03:38,137 --> 00:03:38,697
[SPEAKER_04]: That's OK.

64
00:03:38,917 --> 00:03:39,397
[SPEAKER_04]: Sunday?

65
00:03:39,537 --> 00:03:39,757
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

66
00:03:40,057 --> 00:03:41,018
[SPEAKER_04]: Saturday, the 26th.

67
00:03:41,098 --> 00:03:41,738
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, perfect.

68
00:03:42,078 --> 00:03:42,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

69
00:03:42,338 --> 00:03:44,499
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the rain date's the 27th, right?

70
00:03:44,559 --> 00:03:45,179
[SPEAKER_00]: The rain date.

71
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:45,660
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

72
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,660
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I believe the rain date's the 27th.

73
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:48,180
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.

74
00:03:48,721 --> 00:03:48,881
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

75
00:03:48,941 --> 00:03:49,501
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

76
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:49,701
[SPEAKER_00]: So the 27th.

77
00:03:49,721 --> 00:03:50,421
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, that's OK.

78
00:03:51,242 --> 00:03:51,702
[SPEAKER_00]: That's OK.

79
00:03:52,022 --> 00:03:52,762
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.

80
00:03:52,802 --> 00:03:56,744
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it's much appreciated that you did this for us.

81
00:03:57,044 --> 00:03:57,864
[SPEAKER_00]: We really, really appreciate it.

82
00:03:57,884 --> 00:03:58,324
[SPEAKER_00]: No problem.

83
00:03:58,545 --> 00:03:58,945
[SPEAKER_03]: Anytime.

84
00:03:58,985 --> 00:03:59,065
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.

85
00:03:59,845 --> 00:04:00,046
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.

86
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:01,047
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.

87
00:04:01,187 --> 00:04:01,407
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

88
00:04:01,447 --> 00:04:01,748
[SPEAKER_00]: Ciao.

89
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:02,609
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye, Regina.

90
00:04:05,192 --> 00:04:05,713
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

91
00:04:06,674 --> 00:04:07,375
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

92
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:12,622
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got a representative from Arts Collaborative and that's Regina.

93
00:04:13,082 --> 00:04:13,763
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Regina.

94
00:04:14,144 --> 00:04:14,885
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice to meet you.

95
00:04:15,145 --> 00:04:16,987
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think you were here last time I was on.

96
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:23,962
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I wasn't able to make the last meeting, but Alan took over.

97
00:04:24,362 --> 00:04:25,562
[SPEAKER_03]: He was our past chair.

98
00:04:25,622 --> 00:04:29,443
[SPEAKER_03]: He does a great job as usual, so we knew we were in good hands.

99
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:31,744
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's great.

100
00:04:32,184 --> 00:04:39,566
[SPEAKER_03]: We have, I guess, three events, three one-day licenses that you're applying for, so if you could just give us a little information.

101
00:04:39,606 --> 00:04:41,506
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if they're all basically the same.

102
00:04:42,107 --> 00:04:43,867
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they more or less are.

103
00:04:44,747 --> 00:04:46,788
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're not familiar, we're an arts center.

104
00:04:47,548 --> 00:04:50,170
[SPEAKER_01]: first physical community arts center on Mystic Ave.

105
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:59,175
[SPEAKER_01]: We just opened in January and we just acquired our alcohol insurance and so now I'm just starting to offer some beer and some wine at our closings and openings.

106
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:16,405
[SPEAKER_01]: So the one on the 7th, it's a Thursday evening, it's a closing reception and then we have one, it's an opening reception on the 16th and then for the 17th it's an open studio so the public will be able to come in and see the artists at work.

107
00:05:17,071 --> 00:05:18,413
[SPEAKER_01]: And so those are all really similar.

108
00:05:18,533 --> 00:05:25,982
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be a cash bar, not expecting anything too big, but just wanting to have some options open for Argus.

109
00:05:27,598 --> 00:05:29,159
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, great.

110
00:05:29,819 --> 00:05:41,705
[SPEAKER_03]: I just did notice on the first event, the one on the 7th, yeah.

111
00:05:41,825 --> 00:05:45,507
[SPEAKER_03]: There was just no address on page with the very top.

112
00:05:45,527 --> 00:05:46,868
[SPEAKER_03]: That was just a typo.

113
00:05:47,488 --> 00:05:48,669
[SPEAKER_01]: It is on 162 Mystic Ave, so.

114
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:53,853
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's what I kind of just figured.

115
00:05:54,313 --> 00:05:57,916
[SPEAKER_03]: I looked at the other two and they were both those as well.

116
00:05:57,936 --> 00:05:58,797
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

117
00:05:59,318 --> 00:06:04,102
[SPEAKER_03]: I trust that you where you stated you do have the insurance liability.

118
00:06:05,003 --> 00:06:08,726
[SPEAKER_03]: I trust that the city has the area has that on file where you were here.

119
00:06:08,746 --> 00:06:11,188
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, they have it for a year till next September.

120
00:06:12,049 --> 00:06:12,629
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, great.

121
00:06:12,929 --> 00:06:14,130
[SPEAKER_03]: That's that's terrific.

122
00:06:14,511 --> 00:06:16,753
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's see.

123
00:06:18,143 --> 00:06:21,305
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a diagram with the first one.

124
00:06:21,905 --> 00:06:22,145
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

125
00:06:23,306 --> 00:06:32,110
[SPEAKER_01]: Should have a really similar one because it's going to be the same setup where the public is in the main space, that alcove is where the art is, and the bar will be to the right side.

126
00:06:35,872 --> 00:06:36,812
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

127
00:06:37,432 --> 00:06:42,094
[SPEAKER_03]: You have a bartender that you'll be doing the serving?

128
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:42,955
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

129
00:06:43,815 --> 00:06:46,877
[SPEAKER_01]: I have tip certification, so I'll be on site for all three of these events.

130
00:06:47,727 --> 00:06:48,447
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, great.

131
00:06:48,747 --> 00:06:52,769
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'll be myself, probably, or our other TIPSA certified staff giving them out.

132
00:06:53,749 --> 00:06:54,429
[SPEAKER_03]: Fantastic.

133
00:06:54,489 --> 00:06:57,450
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're aware that you are a non-profit.

134
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:10,034
[SPEAKER_03]: So at any time, besides being no charge to you folks, you do have the ability to serve all alcohol being a non-profit.

135
00:07:10,154 --> 00:07:15,535
[SPEAKER_03]: If at any time you want to do that, it's available to you as well.

136
00:07:15,716 --> 00:07:16,156
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.

137
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,096
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome to know.

138
00:07:18,183 --> 00:07:19,324
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm-hmm.

139
00:07:19,344 --> 00:07:20,405
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.

140
00:07:20,605 --> 00:07:22,847
[SPEAKER_03]: Allen, do you have any questions for Regina?

141
00:07:22,927 --> 00:07:24,248
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I do not.

142
00:07:24,628 --> 00:07:30,593
[SPEAKER_04]: I looked through, you're right, just a little typo on the first one, but the others are fine.

143
00:07:30,653 --> 00:07:35,577
[SPEAKER_04]: We have the insurance, we have the diagram, so we have a good idea of the layout.

144
00:07:36,858 --> 00:07:38,460
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm fine with that.

145
00:07:39,561 --> 00:07:42,043
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no questions, pretty straightforward.

146
00:07:42,063 --> 00:07:45,966
[SPEAKER_04]: Bobby, do you mind if I make a motion, I lump them all together?

147
00:07:46,772 --> 00:07:47,613
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, that'll be fine.

148
00:07:47,873 --> 00:07:48,773
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so I motioned.

149
00:07:48,793 --> 00:07:51,215
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I just ask Regina one quick question?

150
00:07:51,235 --> 00:07:52,015
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, sure, sorry.

151
00:07:53,156 --> 00:07:55,337
[SPEAKER_03]: You had a similar event last month, correct?

152
00:07:55,817 --> 00:07:57,758
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a similar event on Saturday, actually.

153
00:07:57,778 --> 00:07:59,739
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the first time we ever got a one-day permit.

154
00:07:59,799 --> 00:08:02,221
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very smooth, and I was grateful.

155
00:08:02,581 --> 00:08:02,901
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

156
00:08:02,921 --> 00:08:05,843
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I wanted to ask, just to see how it went, how you guys did.

157
00:08:05,863 --> 00:08:06,663
[SPEAKER_01]: It went really well.

158
00:08:07,224 --> 00:08:08,324
[SPEAKER_03]: Good, that's good.

159
00:08:08,344 --> 00:08:08,965
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good thing.

160
00:08:09,145 --> 00:08:10,886
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so you're familiar with it?

161
00:08:11,686 --> 00:08:11,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

162
00:08:13,684 --> 00:08:25,699
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I was going to say Regina to I know you were on the last meeting and we were telling the folks from the library that if you ever have an event and you have a licensed caterer, you really don't a 1 day.

163
00:08:25,799 --> 00:08:25,960
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

164
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:26,620
[SPEAKER_04]: So that.

165
00:08:29,243 --> 00:08:32,064
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was a good teachable moment for Joe.

166
00:08:33,725 --> 00:08:36,526
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so Bobby, do you mind if I make a motion for all three?

167
00:08:36,546 --> 00:08:37,947
[SPEAKER_04]: No, go right ahead.

168
00:08:37,967 --> 00:08:41,568
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, I can see the trash truck coming, so it will probably get loud.

169
00:08:42,268 --> 00:08:50,332
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so I make a motion to approve the one-day license for three separate events.

170
00:08:50,352 --> 00:08:51,732
[SPEAKER_04]: The event to be held on 11-7, 11-16, 11-17.

171
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,700
[SPEAKER_04]: And I hope everything goes well.

172
00:09:01,001 --> 00:09:02,801
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's my motion.

173
00:09:03,742 --> 00:09:05,202
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll second that motion.

174
00:09:05,562 --> 00:09:06,583
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

175
00:09:07,103 --> 00:09:07,243
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

176
00:09:08,363 --> 00:09:09,283
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

177
00:09:09,724 --> 00:09:13,265
[SPEAKER_03]: Hearing and seeing none, your application has been approved.

178
00:09:13,669 --> 00:09:14,910
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.

179
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:16,451
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, best of luck.

180
00:09:16,471 --> 00:09:25,078
[SPEAKER_03]: I hear that Javier had given you kind of a quick- We did, we had a really helpful meeting.

181
00:09:25,359 --> 00:09:29,122
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, just so I can understand, so I don't cause any more emergency meetings.

182
00:09:29,162 --> 00:09:30,563
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be prepared now every month.

183
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:38,109
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand when I need one and when I don't, like the catering and we're for private and we're not selling anything, just basics like that.

184
00:09:38,129 --> 00:09:38,790
[SPEAKER_01]: She was really helpful.

185
00:09:39,522 --> 00:09:40,262
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no, that's great.

186
00:09:40,383 --> 00:09:42,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Anytime you can reach out to Daria, she'll answer your questions.

187
00:09:42,924 --> 00:09:45,746
[SPEAKER_03]: Just give her a little bit of leeway, you know, before the meeting.

188
00:09:46,126 --> 00:09:47,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Wealth of information.

189
00:09:47,186 --> 00:09:57,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I just said, you know, Regina, I hated to say no the last time, but I just, you know, we just don't want to violate the state open meeting laws and have someone point the finger at us.

190
00:09:57,152 --> 00:10:00,094
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, but we're able to accommodate you.

191
00:10:00,374 --> 00:10:00,574
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

192
00:10:00,754 --> 00:10:00,914
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

193
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:01,975
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it so much.

194
00:10:02,075 --> 00:10:02,435
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

195
00:10:02,876 --> 00:10:03,176
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

196
00:10:03,256 --> 00:10:03,496
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

197
00:10:03,676 --> 00:10:03,936
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

198
00:10:03,956 --> 00:10:04,396
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

199
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:11,663
[SPEAKER_03]: And okay, we had a couple of things, Alan, you got a few minutes to spend, Dari.

200
00:10:11,683 --> 00:10:15,546
[SPEAKER_03]: Dari, do you have any news for us?

201
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:20,910
[SPEAKER_03]: Did we reach out to KP for that one day?

202
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:25,973
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I reached out, but haven't heard yet.

203
00:10:26,053 --> 00:10:30,316
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do have another question about

204
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:36,143
[SPEAKER_02]: Ardor dining for Alta Cuba.

205
00:10:36,684 --> 00:10:44,452
[SPEAKER_02]: Alvaro wants to continue, not to serve on the road, I guess, but on the sidewalk.

206
00:10:44,472 --> 00:10:45,252
[SPEAKER_02]: He has seats.

207
00:10:46,394 --> 00:10:49,557
[SPEAKER_02]: So the city is fine with it, but

208
00:10:51,745 --> 00:11:06,249
[SPEAKER_03]: If the city is fine with it, and as long as you agree with me on this, Alan, as far as we go, we get to grant that every year.

209
00:11:06,289 --> 00:11:08,249
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have to go through the state anymore.

210
00:11:08,889 --> 00:11:20,392
[SPEAKER_03]: The city sends out their department heads and all of their inspections pass with the building department, the zoning board, everybody.

211
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:25,136
[SPEAKER_03]: We're okay with them serving alcohol out there.

212
00:11:25,236 --> 00:11:30,802
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think we need to get a alteration of premise because it's not really a permanent structure.

213
00:11:30,842 --> 00:11:31,482
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct, Alan?

214
00:11:32,023 --> 00:11:32,443
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.

215
00:11:33,204 --> 00:11:36,267
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think there are any limitations either.

216
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:37,952
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, what was that?

217
00:11:38,592 --> 00:11:42,256
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think there's any date limitations for the seasonal dining.

218
00:11:42,356 --> 00:11:45,399
[SPEAKER_02]: I was looking at it too, and I didn't see any date limitations.

219
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:45,759
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

220
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:47,161
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I thought the same thing.

221
00:11:47,221 --> 00:11:51,905
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, I feel like there's a date limitation, but I looked through it, and I didn't see any.

222
00:11:52,325 --> 00:11:54,187
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think Mother Nature will take care of that.

223
00:11:54,267 --> 00:11:55,729
[SPEAKER_04]: At some point, it'll just be too cold.

224
00:11:55,769 --> 00:11:56,049
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

225
00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:00,952
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're right to your 1st thought.

226
00:12:01,852 --> 00:12:06,254
[SPEAKER_04]: As long as the city, it meets all the codes and there are no violations.

227
00:12:06,374 --> 00:12:08,615
[SPEAKER_04]: I. Yeah, we're, we're fine with that.

228
00:12:09,717 --> 00:12:11,578
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there's not a problem there.

229
00:12:11,738 --> 00:12:16,882
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not, you know, I'm sure like, like you said, the weather will, will take care of it.

230
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:23,226
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, sidewalk heaters or something, maybe, I don't know, for a little while, but then yeah.

231
00:12:23,706 --> 00:12:29,349
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think he just wanted mainly for the show, Chevalier shows, and then it's been beautiful this weekend.

232
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:32,431
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he just wanted, you know, for the crowd.

233
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:33,072
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.

234
00:12:33,632 --> 00:12:34,293
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

235
00:12:34,433 --> 00:12:35,754
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not a problem with that at all.

236
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:36,775
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

237
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:41,059
[SPEAKER_03]: And what Daria and I was speaking about yesterday, I just stopped in there.

238
00:12:42,741 --> 00:12:56,374
[SPEAKER_03]: When I heard about the three licensees that were looking for a extension for New Year's time extension to go until like, I believe, one o'clock.

239
00:12:59,978 --> 00:13:05,683
[SPEAKER_03]: It bothered me a little bit, especially about Bocelli's because they don't have an entertainment license.

240
00:13:07,284 --> 00:13:25,860
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew there was some issues there for the reason why they didn't apply for a new entertainment license because what I found out yesterday, the reason being I went and spoke with the building commissioner and he said that

241
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:36,998
[SPEAKER_03]: If we issue an entertainment license, it'll change their category of their business from a restaurant to a nightclub.

242
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:52,627
[SPEAKER_03]: So if they leave things the way they are, they can still have functions down in the basement as a restaurant, as long as there's no entertainment, bands, TVs, whatever.

243
00:13:52,647 --> 00:13:53,728
[SPEAKER_04]: I see.

244
00:13:54,847 --> 00:13:57,331
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, OK, well, that's good.

245
00:13:57,411 --> 00:14:03,121
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, so if they want to come before us and have food available,

246
00:14:04,145 --> 00:14:06,346
[SPEAKER_03]: He says, we don't have a problem till one o'clock.

247
00:14:06,406 --> 00:14:10,829
[SPEAKER_03]: And he said, yeah, no, that is not a problem as long as there's no music or entertainment.

248
00:14:10,889 --> 00:14:11,829
[SPEAKER_03]: No entertainment.

249
00:14:11,949 --> 00:14:12,170
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

250
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:13,911
[SPEAKER_03]: So I says, OK, that's fine.

251
00:14:14,831 --> 00:14:23,856
[SPEAKER_03]: So then I went and checked with the city clerk because that was bugging me, because I don't know how long their license goes until that.

252
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:29,880
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you've got it on the record, but their actual license to serve, they one of the

253
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:33,302
[SPEAKER_03]: 1 o'clock ones, or no?

254
00:14:33,783 --> 00:14:35,224
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me look.

255
00:14:35,884 --> 00:14:45,552
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if not, then the city... No, I don't think so, because if she asked for 1 a.m., I don't think they're till 1 a.m.

256
00:14:46,293 --> 00:14:47,494
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me just check real quick.

257
00:14:47,614 --> 00:14:50,757
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me just check on what I did last year for renewals.

258
00:14:51,537 --> 00:14:53,139
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we've got a 1 a.m.

259
00:14:53,219 --> 00:14:57,422
[SPEAKER_03]: on Oasis and on Great American Beer Hall, the other two that are looking, correct?

260
00:14:57,502 --> 00:14:58,984
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so I'm wondering why...

261
00:15:00,756 --> 00:15:03,337
[SPEAKER_02]: why Oasis would even look if they're a tell of 1 a.m.

262
00:15:03,417 --> 00:15:03,817
[SPEAKER_02]: anyways.

263
00:15:05,078 --> 00:15:09,680
[SPEAKER_03]: They're probably just looking for us to extend the liquor license out to 1 a.m.

264
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:15,863
[SPEAKER_03]: We can only extend it out as far as the common Vic says.

265
00:15:16,243 --> 00:15:22,086
[SPEAKER_03]: So if the Oasis got extension of hours, they may not already be extended to one.

266
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:25,408
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the reason why they would ask.

267
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:25,828
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

268
00:15:26,616 --> 00:15:30,919
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, that's why I look for 2 o'clock, but the city won't do 2 o'clock.

269
00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:32,360
[SPEAKER_03]: Their limit is 1.

270
00:15:34,201 --> 00:15:35,962
[SPEAKER_03]: And the thing is, Alan is the.

271
00:15:38,692 --> 00:15:41,674
[SPEAKER_03]: The clerk was very, he had his heels dug in pretty good.

272
00:15:42,175 --> 00:15:45,837
[SPEAKER_03]: And he, I actually, he says, where did you get that information?

273
00:15:45,877 --> 00:15:49,540
[SPEAKER_03]: I says, I get it from the building commissioner, Scott.

274
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:50,821
[SPEAKER_03]: I says, you can call him.

275
00:15:50,941 --> 00:15:54,463
[SPEAKER_03]: Because he says, I had a conversation with him the other day and that's not what he said.

276
00:15:54,483 --> 00:15:57,606
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, well, you can call him while I'm standing here in your office.

277
00:15:57,826 --> 00:16:00,188
[SPEAKER_03]: And he did, and they kind of,

278
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:02,921
[SPEAKER_03]: went back and forth a little bit.

279
00:16:03,602 --> 00:16:18,187
[SPEAKER_03]: And what the city clerk requires, even for a one-day extension of hours, they want the licensee to go before the city council to extend the hours for that one day.

280
00:16:18,207 --> 00:16:23,669
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like an 8-, 10-, 12-page thing that they have to fill out.

281
00:16:24,869 --> 00:16:29,831
[SPEAKER_03]: And before they go to city council, it's got to be advertised in a paper for two weeks.

282
00:16:30,311 --> 00:16:37,393
[SPEAKER_03]: He says it takes about six weeks to do it before they do the advertising, they get on the agenda and everything else.

283
00:16:37,433 --> 00:16:40,134
[SPEAKER_03]: He says they're not going to have time before New Year's.

284
00:16:40,214 --> 00:16:41,815
[SPEAKER_03]: If they do, it's going to be pretty close.

285
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:42,655
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

286
00:16:43,357 --> 00:16:53,603
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I'm counting eight weeks, unless I'm counting wrong, but I think we can give them the option if they want to attempt it.

287
00:16:54,483 --> 00:17:04,289
[SPEAKER_03]: But what I would strongly suggest to them, or to anybody else who's gonna go before the council to get an extension for one day, get an extension for the whole year.

288
00:17:04,629 --> 00:17:08,611
[SPEAKER_03]: Just change your license time to 1 a.m.

289
00:17:08,931 --> 00:17:11,993
[SPEAKER_03]: Seven days a week, 1 a.m., you don't have to worry about it.

290
00:17:12,613 --> 00:17:21,221
[SPEAKER_03]: And according to the city's rules, all alcohol licensees can operate from 11 a.m.

291
00:17:21,842 --> 00:17:22,642
[SPEAKER_03]: to 1 a.m.

292
00:17:22,923 --> 00:17:26,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Monday through Saturday, and from noon to 1 a.m.

293
00:17:27,066 --> 00:17:27,687
[SPEAKER_03]: on Sunday.

294
00:17:31,882 --> 00:17:41,544
[SPEAKER_03]: we want to invoke the 33B, which allows them to come in a couple hours earlier on a Sunday, like for that Patriots game that was just on a special event.

295
00:17:42,384 --> 00:17:45,205
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody does brunches, we can grant it for the whole year.

296
00:17:45,965 --> 00:17:52,366
[SPEAKER_03]: But they'll probably have to do the same thing, go before the city council and through the city clerks.

297
00:17:52,466 --> 00:17:54,227
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a fee, they have to pay a fee.

298
00:17:54,287 --> 00:17:55,547
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're gonna pay a fee?

299
00:17:56,107 --> 00:17:57,587
[SPEAKER_03]: Just get them changed for the whole year.

300
00:17:57,727 --> 00:17:59,428
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we don't run into this problem anymore.

301
00:17:59,448 --> 00:18:01,408
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think anybody will,

302
00:18:02,723 --> 00:18:06,767
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think anybody will say anything about it or have any issue with it, but.

303
00:18:08,889 --> 00:18:13,193
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, Bobby, when you explain it, it sounds very, very straightforward and simple.

304
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:22,181
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a way to get back to both Challis and Oasis just to let them know that that's the policy or that's the procedure?

305
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:25,380
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if Oasis has a 1 a.m.

306
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:31,083
[SPEAKER_03]: license, if they do, then it's a moot point.

307
00:18:31,764 --> 00:18:40,408
[SPEAKER_03]: If Bocelli does not, they gotta have, I mean, we can let them know what the... Bocelli don't, yeah.

308
00:18:40,748 --> 00:18:47,512
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't let them know what we found, but we should strongly encourage them to contact the city clerk.

309
00:18:48,353 --> 00:18:48,553
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

310
00:18:49,134 --> 00:18:51,515
[SPEAKER_03]: And we will let them know what the rules are.

311
00:18:52,236 --> 00:19:01,441
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, if you're OK by the city clerk and the council, the rules are you got to have food out until 1 a.m.

312
00:19:02,022 --> 00:19:03,643
[SPEAKER_03]: when liquor is being served.

313
00:19:04,523 --> 00:19:07,065
[SPEAKER_03]: And also you cannot have any entertainment.

314
00:19:07,285 --> 00:19:11,888
[SPEAKER_03]: You can have party hats, you can have the blowers, you can have the happy new year, whatever you want.

315
00:19:12,028 --> 00:19:15,130
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's no music, no entertainment.

316
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:15,490
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

317
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:16,291
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

318
00:19:16,311 --> 00:19:17,192
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of

319
00:19:18,735 --> 00:19:24,599
[SPEAKER_03]: Because in not that we're being prejudiced against them or anything, it's because you don't have an entertainment license.

320
00:19:24,619 --> 00:19:25,019
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.

321
00:19:25,239 --> 00:19:25,599
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.

322
00:19:25,699 --> 00:19:26,900
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a license.

323
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:27,841
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.

324
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:28,381
[SPEAKER_04]: Problem.

325
00:19:28,421 --> 00:19:28,641
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

326
00:19:29,321 --> 00:19:34,465
[SPEAKER_04]: And they don't have the entertainment license because for whatever reason, it doesn't meet the.

327
00:19:35,305 --> 00:19:38,188
[SPEAKER_04]: The newer codes, the standard codes, right?

328
00:19:38,748 --> 00:19:39,529
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

329
00:19:39,949 --> 00:19:44,833
[SPEAKER_03]: It violates the ordinance.

330
00:19:45,113 --> 00:19:49,977
[SPEAKER_03]: It turns the business description from a restaurant to a nightclub.

331
00:19:50,418 --> 00:19:50,738
[SPEAKER_03]: I see.

332
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:51,919
[SPEAKER_03]: It's entertainment.

333
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:56,543
[SPEAKER_03]: Technically, all these places that we give entertainment licenses to,

334
00:19:57,203 --> 00:19:59,303
[SPEAKER_03]: considered nightclub category, I guess.

335
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:03,484
[SPEAKER_03]: That was right from Scott from the building department.

336
00:20:04,884 --> 00:20:13,206
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the other inspectors who was involved with this when Bocelli's was taken over by the new owners, he was standing there as well.

337
00:20:13,246 --> 00:20:16,487
[SPEAKER_03]: He says, we already really looked into this hard.

338
00:20:16,987 --> 00:20:22,608
[SPEAKER_03]: And I says, well, I kind of figured that was the case where they never applied for an entertainment license.

339
00:20:23,228 --> 00:20:24,088
[SPEAKER_03]: They could get one.

340
00:20:24,748 --> 00:20:40,544
[SPEAKER_03]: if the building owner sprinkles the whole building right and brings it up to code for up to code that type of business but he's not going to do that i'm sure okay um so it makes sense yeah that's kind of when you know what all i could see was

341
00:20:41,485 --> 00:20:46,050
[SPEAKER_03]: another station nightclub via Godfrey or another coconut grove.

342
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:51,015
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, the odds are minimal, but something happens.

343
00:20:51,215 --> 00:21:00,384
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like, you know, I mean, it was, it's difficult to get out of that basement if you don't know where the other exits are.

344
00:21:00,984 --> 00:21:04,428
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, everybody knows the main one that comes in from upstairs dining room.

345
00:21:05,108 --> 00:21:07,992
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's another one by the bathroom that goes up the pike.

346
00:21:08,152 --> 00:21:10,935
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's another one I heard that goes up through the kitchen.

347
00:21:10,955 --> 00:21:22,587
[SPEAKER_03]: I just, I mean, unless the building department and the fire department say that, yeah, it's okay for a night, then I...

348
00:21:24,889 --> 00:21:28,271
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I wouldn't be okay with it unless they said it was all right.

349
00:21:28,411 --> 00:21:38,098
[SPEAKER_03]: And even if they said it was all right, it's still got to go by the city clerk and the city council for the hours to get raised to 1 am.

350
00:21:38,418 --> 00:21:38,578
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

351
00:21:41,373 --> 00:21:43,034
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's logical.

352
00:21:43,354 --> 00:21:44,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, very logical.

353
00:21:44,996 --> 00:21:55,744
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, Daria, you know, if we get the message out to Bocelli's so they can start the ball rolling, because if it does take six to eight weeks, they're running out of time.

354
00:21:56,605 --> 00:21:56,825
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

355
00:21:56,925 --> 00:22:03,991
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's what I was going to suggest to Daria if you want to reach out to her and just explain that.

356
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:06,293
[SPEAKER_03]: If she has any questions, she can give me a call.

357
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:12,284
[SPEAKER_03]: Or whatever, and I explain it a little more detail, but we definitely want her to.

358
00:22:12,304 --> 00:22:16,748
[SPEAKER_03]: To go before the city clerk.

359
00:22:17,849 --> 00:22:22,073
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to make sure that she's doing what they want and, um.

360
00:22:23,566 --> 00:22:34,889
[SPEAKER_03]: and do it ASAP, but I would also wait until you hear back from KP Law with the question that is this a MedFed ordinance?

361
00:22:35,589 --> 00:22:47,972
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, last time, you know, we went through with the club licenses, it's, you know, the building department, this was before Scott got there, but they said that,

362
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,841
[SPEAKER_03]: they couldn't have their licenses till 1 a.m.

363
00:22:50,881 --> 00:22:53,782
[SPEAKER_03]: and it was completely wrong when it was looked into.

364
00:22:54,662 --> 00:23:13,090
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, I'm not saying they're wrong, but it may be a good idea just for KP to take a look, and especially where it was advised by Ralph at the ABCC to check with your legal counsel, the city's legal counsel, before you give them the okay.

365
00:23:13,997 --> 00:23:14,658
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what we're doing.

366
00:23:15,358 --> 00:23:22,303
[SPEAKER_03]: And we kind of know this is the rules, but let's make sure that this is really the rules.

367
00:23:22,803 --> 00:23:23,284
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

368
00:23:23,324 --> 00:23:23,984
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know.

369
00:23:24,004 --> 00:23:24,665
[SPEAKER_04]: Makes sense.

370
00:23:24,805 --> 00:23:25,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Makes sense, Bobby.

371
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:27,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Makes sense.

372
00:23:28,968 --> 00:23:30,889
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's about all we had.

373
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,211
[SPEAKER_03]: There was nothing else pending, right?

374
00:23:33,671 --> 00:23:35,472
[SPEAKER_02]: One question, though, just to clarify.

375
00:23:37,941 --> 00:23:43,646
[SPEAKER_02]: Should I clarify that they cannot have entertainment at the Bocelli's?

376
00:23:44,086 --> 00:23:45,947
[SPEAKER_03]: Bocelli's cannot have entertainment.

377
00:23:46,047 --> 00:23:51,532
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so I think that needs, maybe needs to be said to them too because they might be doing it.

378
00:23:51,732 --> 00:23:52,613
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't, I mean, I don't know.

379
00:23:52,653 --> 00:23:53,413
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just assuming.

380
00:23:53,433 --> 00:23:56,416
[SPEAKER_03]: If they're doing entertainment.

381
00:23:57,217 --> 00:24:00,740
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't know about it unless there's a complaint filed.

382
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:09,327
[SPEAKER_03]: And then law enforcement, our law enforcement, we notify Lieutenant Lockowitz, have him investigated.

383
00:24:10,228 --> 00:24:17,233
[SPEAKER_03]: And then if there's an issue that there is, in fact, entertainment down there, we'd have to put a stop.

384
00:24:17,253 --> 00:24:17,714
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on.

385
00:24:18,014 --> 00:24:18,854
[SPEAKER_02]: I lost you for a second.

386
00:24:18,894 --> 00:24:19,155
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on.

387
00:24:19,175 --> 00:24:20,736
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, OK.

388
00:24:24,999 --> 00:24:25,360
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on.

389
00:24:26,087 --> 00:24:26,567
[SPEAKER_02]: That's okay.

390
00:24:27,327 --> 00:24:27,868
[SPEAKER_04]: Take your time.

391
00:24:33,769 --> 00:24:35,650
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why I can't find my mouse right now.

392
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:39,291
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God.

393
00:24:39,931 --> 00:24:40,911
[SPEAKER_03]: Put out a little cheese.

394
00:24:44,952 --> 00:24:45,972
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll find them real quick.

395
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:53,230
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

396
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:59,154
[SPEAKER_03]: I was, I was playing around with my computer and it went over to my iPad right next to the computer.

397
00:24:59,214 --> 00:24:59,835
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why.

398
00:24:59,855 --> 00:25:01,756
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's funny.

399
00:25:01,996 --> 00:25:03,757
[SPEAKER_02]: We just blew a few.

400
00:25:04,437 --> 00:25:08,040
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why I lost you guys for a second.

401
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:09,341
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God.

402
00:25:09,581 --> 00:25:11,462
[SPEAKER_03]: You're breaking up and freezing a little bit too.

403
00:25:12,323 --> 00:25:12,623
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

404
00:25:12,763 --> 00:25:14,524
[SPEAKER_02]: So everything is turned off at the moment.

405
00:25:14,544 --> 00:25:15,645
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

406
00:25:23,863 --> 00:25:26,445
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well, a few so.

407
00:25:27,806 --> 00:25:29,648
[SPEAKER_02]: Give us a 2nd, make it time.

408
00:25:34,805 --> 00:25:40,167
[SPEAKER_03]: I got until 317 when Apple's supposed to call me, I got a new phone.

409
00:25:41,768 --> 00:25:46,229
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was trying to, Cheryl's phone went through perfect.

410
00:25:46,329 --> 00:25:52,932
[SPEAKER_03]: My phone was, for some reason, I couldn't remember a password to the app store where you get all your apps from.

411
00:25:53,272 --> 00:25:54,613
[SPEAKER_03]: It's different than the Apple ID.

412
00:25:55,533 --> 00:25:55,733
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

413
00:25:56,133 --> 00:25:59,574
[SPEAKER_04]: And you get a 16, a 16.

414
00:25:59,814 --> 00:26:00,774
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.

415
00:26:03,035 --> 00:26:04,935
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't had new phones in six, seven years.

416
00:26:05,315 --> 00:26:10,036
[SPEAKER_03]: So this new one with the Apple and Jensen, blah, blah, blah.

417
00:26:11,497 --> 00:26:13,257
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's just like, they didn't believe me.

418
00:26:13,537 --> 00:26:20,539
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, well, we're in an Apple store and, you know, it's, this is from an Apple phone and blah, this is the accountant.

419
00:26:21,219 --> 00:26:21,399
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope.

420
00:26:21,719 --> 00:26:23,560
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to shut you down for several days.

421
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,580
[SPEAKER_03]: They shut us down seven,

422
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:28,445
[SPEAKER_03]: I think at four o'clock on Saturday.

423
00:26:30,138 --> 00:26:31,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Saturday or Sunday, Sunday.

424
00:26:32,118 --> 00:26:40,280
[SPEAKER_03]: And I still haven't been able to log into that account and half of my apps don't work because I purchased them out of the app store and I can't get access to them.

425
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:47,702
[SPEAKER_03]: So they sent me an email saying, somebody will call you at 317 on Wednesday the 20th.

426
00:26:48,002 --> 00:26:53,443
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, this is high security stuff, man.

427
00:26:55,884 --> 00:26:58,405
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyways, so I got until 317.

428
00:27:02,486 --> 00:27:03,206
[SPEAKER_04]: Daria, are you back?

429
00:27:03,226 --> 00:27:03,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you hear us?

430
00:27:07,248 --> 00:27:08,189
[SPEAKER_03]: No, probably not.

431
00:27:08,809 --> 00:27:20,854
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if she wants to stop it and start it again.

432
00:27:21,975 --> 00:27:22,375
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder.

433
00:27:22,855 --> 00:27:23,735
[SPEAKER_04]: That might make sense.

434
00:27:23,755 --> 00:27:25,536
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

435
00:27:25,576 --> 00:27:26,177
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you do that?

436
00:27:26,197 --> 00:27:27,057
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't you hang up?

437
00:27:27,921 --> 00:27:29,262
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not a big Zoomer.

438
00:27:29,422 --> 00:27:32,045
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know too much about how to work this foolish thing.

439
00:27:32,485 --> 00:27:32,766
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

440
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:41,994
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think something's freezing up on her end because see your picture?

441
00:27:42,675 --> 00:27:45,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.

442
00:27:45,637 --> 00:27:48,060
[SPEAKER_04]: I always say technology is wonderful when it works.

443
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:49,741
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.

444
00:27:51,222 --> 00:27:51,683
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

445
00:27:54,037 --> 00:27:56,599
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you had to shut off the video one time too, right?

446
00:27:56,859 --> 00:27:58,000
[SPEAKER_03]: So we could get your voice.

447
00:27:59,221 --> 00:28:00,202
[SPEAKER_03]: Something was going on.

448
00:28:00,522 --> 00:28:00,742
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

449
00:28:04,205 --> 00:28:05,025
[SPEAKER_03]: Any trips planned?

450
00:28:05,886 --> 00:28:06,566
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you hear me now?

451
00:28:06,586 --> 00:28:09,008
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I can hear you, yeah.

452
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:10,930
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you hear us?

453
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:12,471
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I can.

454
00:28:13,211 --> 00:28:14,192
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, great.

455
00:28:16,034 --> 00:28:17,515
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, that's the thing.

456
00:28:19,096 --> 00:28:20,397
[SPEAKER_03]: Turn off the picture, that's all.

457
00:28:22,697 --> 00:28:29,781
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think we left it where we were just, before we do anything, let's get an opinion from KP Law.

458
00:28:29,981 --> 00:28:31,222
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's kind of where we were.

459
00:28:31,242 --> 00:28:32,142
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

460
00:28:32,482 --> 00:28:32,662
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

461
00:28:33,283 --> 00:28:34,323
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the last thing I heard.

462
00:28:34,343 --> 00:28:35,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

463
00:28:35,644 --> 00:28:47,150
[SPEAKER_03]: And then after we get the answer from KP Law, hopefully it'll be within a day or two, you can reach out to Bocelli's and let them know exactly what we're doing.

464
00:28:48,002 --> 00:28:51,404
[SPEAKER_03]: Because in a sense, I'm reaching out to them, tell them to do all this stuff.

465
00:28:51,484 --> 00:28:53,445
[SPEAKER_03]: If KP Law says something different.

466
00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:54,445
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they don't have to do it.

467
00:28:54,505 --> 00:28:55,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

468
00:28:55,105 --> 00:28:55,346
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

469
00:28:56,286 --> 00:28:56,746
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

470
00:28:58,167 --> 00:28:58,447
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

471
00:28:59,067 --> 00:28:59,708
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, cool.

472
00:29:01,789 --> 00:29:02,229
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

473
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:05,951
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Chairman, should I make a motion to adjourn?

474
00:29:07,091 --> 00:29:07,331
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

475
00:29:07,351 --> 00:29:08,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you all set, Daria?

476
00:29:09,067 --> 00:29:12,889
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, I think I didn't know if you had any other questions with that.

477
00:29:13,409 --> 00:29:14,910
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I think that was it.

478
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:18,151
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so I make a motion to adjourn today's meeting.

479
00:29:18,271 --> 00:29:18,391
[SPEAKER_04]: It's 1.30.

480
00:29:18,511 --> 00:29:21,933
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, all those in favor.

481
00:29:22,373 --> 00:29:22,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

482
00:29:24,494 --> 00:29:26,195
[SPEAKER_03]: Hearing and saying none, the ayes have it.

483
00:29:26,635 --> 00:29:27,055
[SPEAKER_03]: Very good.

484
00:29:27,235 --> 00:29:27,835
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

485
00:29:27,875 --> 00:29:29,276
[SPEAKER_03]: Good to see you, Bobby.
