    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=98.245">You</a>  used to call it the snack bar.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=99.986">The</a>  snack bar, yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=103.848">Right</a>  in front of that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=105.749">And</a>  it's cordoned off with like riot fencing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=109.251">So,</a>  you know, people can't just kind of sweep in. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=113.854">You</a>  have to literally enter from just one specific area. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=117.216">And</a>  we have like no alcohol beyond this point signs. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=123.64">And</a>  that's about it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=124.461">So</a>  yeah, they're going to be serving beer and like mulled wine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=127.885">Nice.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=132.127">Yeah,</a>  you folks do this every year. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=134.248">I</a>  guess the last couple of three years that I've been on, we've had no problems. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=140.789">It's</a>  a pretty smooth thing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=141.91">And</a>  as you say, it just kind of got bypassed in the shuffle. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=147.011">But</a>  we don't mind when there's a situation like this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=150.592">We</a>  can ensure a special meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=153.432">That's</a>  not a problem at all. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=156.444">Alan,</a>  any questions?</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=158.566">No,</a>  no, I'm familiar with the event. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=160.528">I</a>  grew up up the Heights. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=161.669">I'm</a>  very familiar with Wright's Palm. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=163.651">We</a>  used to sneak in there after hours, all that stuff. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=168.296">But</a>  no, it's a great event. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=170.698">Lisa</a>  was telling me about it, because I was asking Daria if the pumpkins float. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=175.363">So</a>  they were kind of giving me an overview. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=177.925">But</a>  I'm perfectly fine with it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=180.986">I'd</a>  like to make a motion to approve the one-day license for October 26, which is Sunday from 6-8.30 PM. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=192.071">I</a>  hope you do have 700 guests. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=193.671">That</a>  would be fantastic. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=195.132">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=198.473">Like</a>  I said, that'd be my motion to accept the one-day license for Sunday.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=203.671">Okay,</a>  and I will second that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=206.315">All</a>  those in favor, aye. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=208.479">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=209.64">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=210.121">It</a>  is approved.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=225.479">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=245.192">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=246.674">Let's</a>  see. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=247.455">We've</a>  got a representative from Arts Collaborative and that's Regina. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=253.082">Hi,</a>  Regina.</p>

    <p>[XXXXXX00103_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=254.144">Nice</a>  to meet you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=255.145">I</a>  don't think you were here last time I was on.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=257.92">Yes,</a>  I wasn't able to make the last meeting, but Alan took over. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=264.362">He</a>  was our past chair. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=265.622">He</a>  does a great job as usual, so we knew we were in good hands. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=271.004">Yeah,</a>  that's great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=272.184">We</a>  have, I guess, three events, three one-day licenses that you're applying for, so if you could just give us a little information. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=279.606">I</a>  mean, if they're all basically the same.</p>

    <p>[XXXXXX00103_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=282.107">Yeah,</a>  they more or less are. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=284.747">So</a>  if you're not familiar, we're an arts center. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=287.548">first</a>  physical community arts center on Mystic Ave. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=290.21">We</a>  just opened in January and we just acquired our alcohol insurance and so now I'm just starting to offer some beer and some wine at our closings and openings. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=299.775">So</a>  the one on the 7th, it's a Thursday evening, it's a closing reception and then we have one, it's an opening reception on the 16th and then for the 17th it's an open studio so the public will be able to come in and see the artists at work. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=317.071">And</a>  so those are all really similar. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=318.533">It'll</a>  be a cash bar, not expecting anything too big, but just wanting to have some options open for Argus.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=327.598">Okay,</a>  great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=329.819">I</a>  just did notice on the first event, the one on the 7th, yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=341.825">There</a>  was just no address on page with the very top. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=345.527">That</a>  was just a typo.</p>

    <p>[XXXXXX00103_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=347.488">It</a>  is on 162 Mystic Ave, so.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=350.43">Yeah,</a>  that's what I kind of just figured. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=354.313">I</a>  looked at the other two and they were both those as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=357.936">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=359.318">I</a>  trust that you where you stated you do have the insurance liability. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=365.003">I</a>  trust that the city has the area has that on file where you were here.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=368.746">Yes,</a>  they have it for a year till next September.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=372.049">Okay,</a>  great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=372.929">That's</a>  that's terrific. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=374.511">And</a>  let's see.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=378.143">We</a>  have a diagram with the first one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=381.905">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[XXXXXX00103_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=383.306">Should</a>  have a really similar one because it's going to be the same setup where the public is in the main space, that alcove is where the art is, and the bar will be to the right side.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=395.872">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=397.432">You</a>  have a bartender that you'll be doing the serving?</p>

    <p>[XXXXXX00103_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=402.135">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=403.815">I</a>  have tip certification, so I'll be on site for all three of these events. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=407.727">Oh,</a>  great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=408.747">So</a>  it'll be myself, probably, or our other TIPSA certified staff giving them out.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=413.749">Fantastic.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=414.489">And</a>  you're aware that you are a non-profit. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=418.29">So</a>  at any time, besides being no charge to you folks, you do have the ability to serve all alcohol being a non-profit. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=430.154">If</a>  at any time you want to do that, it's available to you as well.</p>

    <p>[XXXXXX00103_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=435.716">That's</a>  great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=436.436">That's</a>  awesome to know.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=438.183">Mm-hmm.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=439.344">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=440.605">Allen,</a>  do you have any questions for Regina?</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=442.927">No,</a>  I do not. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=444.628">I</a>  looked through, you're right, just a little typo on the first one, but the others are fine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=450.653">We</a>  have the insurance, we have the diagram, so we have a good idea of the layout. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=456.858">So</a>  I'm fine with that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=459.561">I</a>  have no questions, pretty straightforward. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=462.063">Bobby,</a>  do you mind if I make a motion, I lump them all together? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=466.772">Sure,</a>  that'll be fine.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=467.873">Okay,</a>  so I motioned. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=468.793">Can</a>  I just ask Regina one quick question? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=471.235">Oh,</a>  sure, sorry. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=473.156">You</a>  had a similar event last month, correct?</p>

    <p>[XXXXXX00103_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=475.817">We</a>  had a similar event on Saturday, actually. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=477.778">It</a>  was the first time we ever got a one-day permit. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=479.799">It</a>  was very smooth, and I was grateful. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=482.581">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=482.921">That's</a>  what I wanted to ask, just to see how it went, how you guys did.</p>

    <p>[XXXXXX00103_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=485.863">It</a>  went really well.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=487.224">Good,</a>  that's good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=488.344">That's</a>  a good thing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=489.145">Okay,</a>  so you're familiar with it?</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=491.686">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=493.684">No,</a>  I was going to say Regina to I know you were on the last meeting and we were telling the folks from the library that if you ever have an event and you have a licensed caterer, you really don't a 1 day. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=505.799">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=505.98">So</a>  that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=509.243">So</a>  that was a good teachable moment for Joe. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=513.725">All</a>  right, so Bobby, do you mind if I make a motion for all three? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=516.546">No,</a>  go right ahead. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=517.967">All</a>  right, I can see the trash truck coming, so it will probably get loud. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=522.268">All</a>  right, so I make a motion to approve the one-day license for three separate events. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=530.352">The</a>  event to be held on 11-7, 11-16, 11-17. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=539.54">And</a>  I hope everything goes well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=541.001">So</a>  that's my motion.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=543.742">I'll</a>  second that motion. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=545.562">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=547.103">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=548.363">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=549.724">Hearing</a>  and seeing none, your application has been approved.</p>

    <p>[XXXXXX00103_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=553.669">Thank</a>  you so much.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=555.27">All</a>  right, best of luck. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=556.471">I</a>  hear that Javier had given you kind of a quick- We did, we had a really helpful meeting.</p>

    <p>[XXXXXX00103_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=565.359">Yeah,</a>  just so I can understand, so I don't cause any more emergency meetings. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=569.162">I'll</a>  be prepared now every month. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=570.623">I</a>  understand when I need one and when I don't, like the catering and we're for private and we're not selling anything, just basics like that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=578.129">She</a>  was really helpful.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=579.522">Yeah,</a>  no, that's great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=580.383">Anytime</a>  you can reach out to Daria, she'll answer your questions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=582.924">Just</a>  give her a little bit of leeway, you know, before the meeting.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=586.126">Wealth</a>  of information. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=587.186">Yeah,</a>  I just said, you know, Regina, I hated to say no the last time, but I just, you know, we just don't want to violate the state open meeting laws and have someone point the finger at us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=597.152">And</a>  so, but we're able to accommodate you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=600.374">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[XXXXXX00103_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=600.754">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=600.934">I</a>  appreciate it so much. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=602.075">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=602.876">Cool.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=603.256">Great.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=603.676">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=603.956">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=607.1">And</a>  okay, we had a couple of things, Alan, you got a few minutes to spend, Dari. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=611.683">Dari,</a>  do you have any news for us? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=615.666">Did</a>  we reach out to KP for that one day?</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=620.93">Yes,</a>  I reached out, but haven't heard yet. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=626.053">But</a>  I do have another question about <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=633.16">Ardor</a>  dining for Alta Cuba. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=636.684">Alvaro</a>  wants to continue, not to serve on the road, I guess, but on the sidewalk. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=644.472">He</a>  has seats. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=646.394">So</a>  the city is fine with it, but</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=651.745">If</a>  the city is fine with it, and as long as you agree with me on this, Alan, as far as we go, we get to grant that every year. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=666.289">We</a>  don't have to go through the state anymore. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=668.889">The</a>  city sends out their department heads and all of their inspections pass with the building department, the zoning board, everybody. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=681.333">We're</a>  okay with them serving alcohol out there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=685.236">I</a>  don't think we need to get a alteration of premise because it's not really a permanent structure. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=690.842">Correct,</a>  Alan? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=692.023">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=693.204">I</a>  don't think there are any limitations either. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=697.291">I'm</a>  sorry, what was that? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=698.592">I</a>  don't think there's any date limitations for the seasonal dining.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=702.356">I</a>  was looking at it too, and I didn't see any date limitations.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=705.579">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=705.779">Because</a>  I thought the same thing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=707.221">I</a>  was like, I feel like there's a date limitation, but I looked through it, and I didn't see any.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=712.325">And</a>  I think Mother Nature will take care of that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=714.267">At</a>  some point, it'll just be too cold. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=715.769">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=717.37">And</a>  you're right to your 1st thought. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=721.852">As</a>  long as the city, it meets all the codes and there are no violations. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=726.374">I.</a>  Yeah, we're, we're fine with that.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=729.717">Yeah,</a>  there's not a problem there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=731.738">And</a>  it's not, you know, I'm sure like, like you said, the weather will, will take care of it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=736.902">I</a>  mean, sidewalk heaters or something, maybe, I don't know, for a little while, but then yeah.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=743.706">Yeah,</a>  I think he just wanted mainly for the show, Chevalier shows, and then it's been beautiful this weekend. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=750.09">Yeah,</a>  he just wanted, you know, for the crowd. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=752.451">So</a>  yeah.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=753.632">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=754.433">No,</a>  not a problem with that at all. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=756.255">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=756.875">And</a>  what Daria and I was speaking about yesterday, I just stopped in there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=762.741">When</a>  I heard about the three licensees that were looking for a extension for New Year's time extension to go until like, I believe, one o'clock. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=779.978">It</a>  bothered me a little bit, especially about Bocelli's because they don't have an entertainment license. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=787.284">I</a>  knew there was some issues there for the reason why they didn't apply for a new entertainment license because what I found out yesterday, the reason being I went and spoke with the building commissioner and he said that <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=807.273">If</a>  we issue an entertainment license, it'll change their category of their business from a restaurant to a nightclub. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=819.56">So</a>  if they leave things the way they are, they can still have functions down in the basement as a restaurant, as long as there's no entertainment, bands, TVs, whatever.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=832.647">I</a>  see.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=834.847">And</a>  I said, OK, well, that's good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=837.411">I</a>  said, so if they want to come before us and have food available, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=844.145">He</a>  says, we don't have a problem till one o'clock. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=846.406">And</a>  he said, yeah, no, that is not a problem as long as there's no music or entertainment. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=850.889">No</a>  entertainment. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=851.949">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=852.71">So</a>  I says, OK, that's fine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=854.831">So</a>  then I went and checked with the city clerk because that was bugging me, because I don't know how long their license goes until that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=863.896">I</a>  don't know if you've got it on the record, but their actual license to serve, they one of the <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=870.94">1</a>  o'clock ones, or no?</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=873.783">Let</a>  me look. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=875.884">Because</a>  if not, then the city... No, I don't think so, because if she asked for 1 a.m., I don't think they're till 1 a.m. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=886.293">Let</a>  me just check real quick. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=887.614">Let</a>  me just check on what I did last year for renewals.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=891.537">Because</a>  we've got a 1 a.m. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=893.219">on</a>  Oasis and on Great American Beer Hall, the other two that are looking, correct?</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=897.502">Yeah,</a>  so I'm wondering why... <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=900.756">why</a>  Oasis would even look if they're a tell of 1 a.m. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=903.417">anyways.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=905.078">They're</a>  probably just looking for us to extend the liquor license out to 1 a.m. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=909.78">We</a>  can only extend it out as far as the common Vic says. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=916.243">So</a>  if the Oasis got extension of hours, they may not already be extended to one.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=923.547">That's</a>  the reason why they would ask. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=925.708">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=926.616">Now,</a>  that's why I look for 2 o'clock, but the city won't do 2 o'clock. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=931.019">Their</a>  limit is 1. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=934.201">And</a>  the thing is, Alan is the. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=938.692">The</a>  clerk was very, he had his heels dug in pretty good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=942.175">And</a>  he, I actually, he says, where did you get that information? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=945.877">I</a>  says, I get it from the building commissioner, Scott. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=949.58">I</a>  says, you can call him. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=950.941">Because</a>  he says, I had a conversation with him the other day and that's not what he said. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=954.483">I</a>  said, well, you can call him while I'm standing here in your office. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=957.826">And</a>  he did, and they kind of, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=961.541">went</a>  back and forth a little bit. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=963.602">And</a>  what the city clerk requires, even for a one-day extension of hours, they want the licensee to go before the city council to extend the hours for that one day. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=978.207">And</a>  it's like an 8-, 10-, 12-page thing that they have to fill out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=984.869">And</a>  before they go to city council, it's got to be advertised in a paper for two weeks. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=990.311">He</a>  says it takes about six weeks to do it before they do the advertising, they get on the agenda and everything else. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=997.433">He</a>  says they're not going to have time before New Year's. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1000.214">If</a>  they do, it's going to be pretty close.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1002.495">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1003.357">You</a>  know, I'm counting eight weeks, unless I'm counting wrong, but I think we can give them the option if they want to attempt it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1014.483">But</a>  what I would strongly suggest to them, or to anybody else who's gonna go before the council to get an extension for one day, get an extension for the whole year. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1024.629">Just</a>  change your license time to 1 a.m. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1028.931">Seven</a>  days a week, 1 a.m., you don't have to worry about it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1032.613">And</a>  according to the city's rules, all alcohol licensees can operate from 11 a.m. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1041.842">to</a>  1 a.m. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1042.923">Monday</a>  through Saturday, and from noon to 1 a.m. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1047.066">on</a>  Sunday. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1051.882">we</a>  want to invoke the 33B, which allows them to come in a couple hours earlier on a Sunday, like for that Patriots game that was just on a special event. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1062.384">Somebody</a>  does brunches, we can grant it for the whole year. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1065.965">But</a>  they'll probably have to do the same thing, go before the city council and through the city clerks. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1072.466">There's</a>  a fee, they have to pay a fee. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1074.287">So</a>  you're gonna pay a fee? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1076.107">Just</a>  get them changed for the whole year. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1077.727">Now</a>  we don't run into this problem anymore. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1079.448">I</a>  don't think anybody will, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1082.723">I</a>  don't think anybody will say anything about it or have any issue with it, but.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1088.889">You</a>  know, Bobby, when you explain it, it sounds very, very straightforward and simple. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1093.333">Is</a>  there a way to get back to both Challis and Oasis just to let them know that that's the policy or that's the procedure?</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1103.119">Well,</a>  if Oasis has a 1 a.m. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1105.42">license,</a>  if they do, then it's a moot point. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1111.764">If</a>  Bocelli does not, they gotta have, I mean, we can let them know what the... Bocelli don't, yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1120.748">They</a>  don't let them know what we found, but we should strongly encourage them to contact the city clerk. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1128.353">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1129.134">And</a>  we will let them know what the rules are. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1132.236">OK,</a>  if you're OK by the city clerk and the council, the rules are you got to have food out until 1 a.m. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1142.022">when</a>  liquor is being served. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1144.523">And</a>  also you cannot have any entertainment. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1147.285">You</a>  can have party hats, you can have the blowers, you can have the happy new year, whatever you want. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1152.028">But</a>  there's no music, no entertainment. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1155.29">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1156.071">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1156.311">So</a>  it's kind of <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1158.735">Because</a>  in not that we're being prejudiced against them or anything, it's because you don't have an entertainment license. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1164.619">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1165.239">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1165.699">That's</a>  a license. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1167.4">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1168.041">Problem.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1168.421">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1169.321">And</a>  they don't have the entertainment license because for whatever reason, it doesn't meet the. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1175.305">The</a>  newer codes, the standard codes, right?</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1178.748">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1179.949">It</a>  violates the ordinance. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1185.113">It</a>  turns the business description from a restaurant to a nightclub. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1190.418">I</a>  see. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1190.958">It's</a>  entertainment. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1193.08">Technically,</a>  all these places that we give entertainment licenses to, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1197.203">considered</a>  nightclub category, I guess. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1200.324">That</a>  was right from Scott from the building department. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1204.884">And</a>  one of the other inspectors who was involved with this when Bocelli's was taken over by the new owners, he was standing there as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1213.246">He</a>  says, we already really looked into this hard. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1216.987">And</a>  I says, well, I kind of figured that was the case where they never applied for an entertainment license. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1223.228">They</a>  could get one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1224.748">if</a>  the building owner sprinkles the whole building right and brings it up to code for up to code that type of business but he's not going to do that i'm sure okay um so it makes sense yeah that's kind of when you know what all i could see was <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1241.485">another</a>  station nightclub via Godfrey or another coconut grove. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1246.29">I</a>  mean, you know, the odds are minimal, but something happens. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1251.215">It's</a>  just like, you know, I mean, it was, it's difficult to get out of that basement if you don't know where the other exits are. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1260.984">I</a>  mean, everybody knows the main one that comes in from upstairs dining room. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1265.108">But</a>  there's another one by the bathroom that goes up the pike. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1268.152">And</a>  then there's another one I heard that goes up through the kitchen. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1270.955">I</a>  just, I mean, unless the building department and the fire department say that, yeah, it's okay for a night, then I... <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1284.889">You</a>  know, I wouldn't be okay with it unless they said it was all right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1288.411">And</a>  even if they said it was all right, it's still got to go by the city clerk and the city council for the hours to get raised to 1 am. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1298.418">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1301.373">So</a>  that's logical.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1303.354">Yeah,</a>  very logical. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1304.996">I</a>  think, Daria, you know, if we get the message out to Bocelli's so they can start the ball rolling, because if it does take six to eight weeks, they're running out of time.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1316.605">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1316.925">Well,</a>  that's what I was going to suggest to Daria if you want to reach out to her and just explain that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1324.031">If</a>  she has any questions, she can give me a call. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1327.279">Or</a>  whatever, and I explain it a little more detail, but we definitely want her to. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1332.304">To</a>  go before the city clerk. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1337.849">Just</a>  to make sure that she's doing what they want and, um. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1343.566">and</a>  do it ASAP, but I would also wait until you hear back from KP Law with the question that is this a MedFed ordinance? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1355.589">I</a>  mean, you know, last time, you know, we went through with the club licenses, it's, you know, the building department, this was before Scott got there, but they said that, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1368.94">they</a>  couldn't have their licenses till 1 a.m. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1370.881">and</a>  it was completely wrong when it was looked into. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1374.662">So,</a>  you know, I'm not saying they're wrong, but it may be a good idea just for KP to take a look, and especially where it was advised by Ralph at the ABCC to check with your legal counsel, the city's legal counsel, before you give them the okay. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1393.997">That's</a>  what we're doing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1395.358">And</a>  we kind of know this is the rules, but let's make sure that this is really the rules.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1402.803">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1403.324">Yeah,</a>  I know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1404.004">Makes</a>  sense. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1404.805">Makes</a>  sense, Bobby. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1405.946">Makes</a>  sense.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1408.968">So</a>  I think that's about all we had.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1411.75">There</a>  was nothing else pending, right?</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1413.671">One</a>  question, though, just to clarify. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1417.941">Should</a>  I clarify that they cannot have entertainment at the Bocelli's?</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1424.086">Bocelli's</a>  cannot have entertainment.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1426.047">Okay,</a>  so I think that needs, maybe needs to be said to them too because they might be doing it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1431.732">I</a>  don't, I mean, I don't know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1432.653">I'm</a>  just assuming.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1433.433">If</a>  they're doing entertainment. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1437.217">We</a>  don't know about it unless there's a complaint filed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1441.46">And</a>  then law enforcement, our law enforcement, we notify Lieutenant Lockowitz, have him investigated. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1450.228">And</a>  then if there's an issue that there is, in fact, entertainment down there, we'd have to put a stop.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1457.253">Hold</a>  on. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1458.014">I</a>  lost you for a second. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1458.894">Hold</a>  on. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1459.175">Oh,</a>  OK. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1464.999">Hold</a>  on. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1466.087">That's</a>  okay.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1467.327">Take</a>  your time.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1473.769">I</a>  don't know why I can't find my mouse right now.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1478.41">Oh</a>  my God. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1479.931">Put</a>  out a little cheese. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1484.952">We'll</a>  find them real quick. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1492.87">Why?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1493.45">I</a>  was, I was playing around with my computer and it went over to my iPad right next to the computer. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1499.214">I</a>  don't know why.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1499.855">Oh,</a>  that's funny. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1501.996">We</a>  just blew a few. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1504.437">So</a>  that's why I lost you guys for a second.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1508.74">Oh</a>  my God. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1509.581">You're</a>  breaking up and freezing a little bit too.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1512.323">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1512.763">So</a>  everything is turned off at the moment. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1514.544">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1523.863">Yeah,</a>  well, a few so. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1527.806">Give</a>  us a 2nd, make it time.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1534.805">I</a>  got until 317 when Apple's supposed to call me, I got a new phone. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1541.768">And</a>  I was trying to, Cheryl's phone went through perfect. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1546.329">My</a>  phone was, for some reason, I couldn't remember a password to the app store where you get all your apps from. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1553.272">It's</a>  different than the Apple ID.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1555.533">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1556.133">And</a>  you get a 16, a 16.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1559.814">Yeah,</a>  exactly. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1563.035">We</a>  haven't had new phones in six, seven years. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1565.315">So</a>  this new one with the Apple and Jensen, blah, blah, blah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1571.497">But</a>  it's just like, they didn't believe me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1573.537">I</a>  said, well, we're in an Apple store and, you know, it's, this is from an Apple phone and blah, this is the accountant. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1581.219">Nope.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1581.719">We're</a>  going to shut you down for several days. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1583.6">They</a>  shut us down seven, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1586.001">I</a>  think at four o'clock on Saturday. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1590.138">Saturday</a>  or Sunday, Sunday. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1592.118">And</a>  I still haven't been able to log into that account and half of my apps don't work because I purchased them out of the app store and I can't get access to them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1600.68">So</a>  they sent me an email saying, somebody will call you at 317 on Wednesday the 20th. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1608.002">It's</a>  like, this is high security stuff, man. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1615.884">But</a>  anyways, so I got until 317.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1622.486">Daria,</a>  are you back? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1623.226">Can</a>  you hear us?</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1627.248">No,</a>  probably not. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1628.809">I</a>  wonder if she wants to stop it and start it again.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1641.975">I</a>  wonder. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1642.855">That</a>  might make sense.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1643.755">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1645.576">Can</a>  you do that? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1646.197">Why</a>  don't you hang up? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1647.921">I'm</a>  not a big Zoomer. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1649.422">I</a>  don't know too much about how to work this foolish thing.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1652.485">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1658.09">Yeah,</a>  I think something's freezing up on her end because see your picture?</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1662.675">Yeah,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1665.637">I</a>  always say technology is wonderful when it works.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1669.02">Yeah,</a>  exactly. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1671.222">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1674.037">I</a>  think you had to shut off the video one time too, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1676.859">So</a>  we could get your voice. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1679.221">Something</a>  was going on. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1680.522">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1684.205">Any</a>  trips planned?</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1685.886">Can</a>  you hear me now? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1686.586">Oh,</a>  I can hear you, yeah.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1690.189">Can</a>  you hear us?</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1691.81">Yes,</a>  I can.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1693.211">Okay,</a>  great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1696.034">Okay,</a>  that's the thing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1699.096">Turn</a>  off the picture, that's all.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1702.697">So</a>  I think we left it where we were just, before we do anything, let's get an opinion from KP Law. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1709.981">I</a>  think that's kind of where we were. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1711.242">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1712.482">Yep.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1713.283">That's</a>  the last thing I heard. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1714.343">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1715.644">And</a>  then after we get the answer from KP Law, hopefully it'll be within a day or two, you can reach out to Bocelli's and let them know exactly what we're doing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1728.002">Because</a>  in a sense, I'm reaching out to them, tell them to do all this stuff. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1731.484">If</a>  KP Law says something different.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1733.465">Yeah,</a>  they don't have to do it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1734.505">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1735.105">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1736.286">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1738.167">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1739.067">Okay,</a>  cool. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1741.789">Great.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1744.07">Mr.</a>  Chairman, should I make a motion to adjourn?</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1747.091">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1747.351">Are</a>  you all set, Daria? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1749.067">Yeah,</a>  yeah, I think I didn't know if you had any other questions with that.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1753.409">No,</a>  I think that was it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1754.93">Okay,</a>  so I make a motion to adjourn today's meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1758.271">It's</a>  1.30.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1758.511">Okay,</a>  all those in favor. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1762.373">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1764.494">Hearing</a>  and saying none, the ayes have it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1766.635">Very</a>  good.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1767.235">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-10-23-24&start=1767.875">Good</a>  to see you, Bobby.</p>
