    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=57.585s">Hello.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=59.647s">You</a>  know, let me just check in with Member McLaughlin real quick, because I know that she may not be able to make it. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=89.579s">Hi,</a>  everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=90.221s">Sorry</a>  for the delay. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=91.184s">We're</a>  just waiting to see if one more member will join us. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=94.734s">And</a>  if she can't, we can start without her. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=155.77s">All</a>  right, I think we should get started. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=158.692s">Wait</a>  a second, I just see she just got the message. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=162.994s">All</a>  right, well, we'll get started. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=177.722s">I'm</a>  gonna actually share my screen out so that I can see you and do the, <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=186.247s">You</a>  can share. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=190.968s">Click</a>  on the wrong part of that little share icon every time. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=193.969s">All</a>  right, Chrome. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=211.025s">All</a>  right, it's 4.03. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=212.386s">Thank</a>  you all for coming tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=213.866s">I'm</a>  going to call to order the Rules Policy and Equity Subcommittee meeting of the Medford School Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=221.83s">And</a>  then I will get to the, actually, do I read the agenda first or after I take attendance? <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=226.551s">I</a>  always forget that. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=227.532s">Does</a>  it matter?</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=230.013s">I</a>  think you read this first and then do attendance.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=388.854s">Here.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=390.294s">Member</a>  McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=392.094s">I</a>  don't know if she is here. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=393.375s">I'll</a>  mark her absent for now. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=395.715s">And</a>  Member Ruseau, here to present, we have Quorum. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=398.898s">All</a>  right, so our agenda for tonight we have three items. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=402.021s">The</a>  first one is to review policy I see I see a the school year calendar which we actually just approved in December of 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=410.528s">And</a>  during that somewhat lengthy process we we acknowledge that we. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=418.247s">probably</a>  weren't gonna get it exactly right the first time out, cause it was a pretty substantial change from past practice. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=424.548s">We</a>  created something we call variable date observances. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=428.93s">Actually,</a>  I'll bring that policy up. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=434.031s">So</a>  we created, let me scroll down to that part, it's up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=441.015s">So</a>  we've created three different categories for each of the items on the observance list. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=445.916s">We</a>  have no school days, which I think everybody knows what a no school day is, an excused absence day, which is not new, and a blocked day, which means that we are essentially forbidding school-related events that are school-sponsored to occur on those days, in particular, major tests and exams, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=471.655s">And</a>  then, so that, I take it back. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=474.737s">Those</a>  three types of categories existed already. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=477.899s">They</a>  were not explicit in the old policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=480.9s">What</a>  we have also done here is we've created an observance list that will help the superintendent roll this out each November. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=490.746s">We</a>  have what we call static date observances. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=492.967s">So</a>  date observances that occur on a specific date, kind of obvious. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=497.866s">And</a>  then there's a whole host of observances that occur on different kinds of calendars, whether it's a lunar calendar or I believe the, well, I don't know all the different calendars. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=513.015s">I</a>  won't pretend to know all that, but these are all calendar types, observance types that actually have a different date each year. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=520.28s">So</a>  they have to kind of be looked up before they can be put into the calendar. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=526.303s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=528.105s">We</a>  are here to discuss the addition, if that's how the members here and then the full school committee wants to go, of three additional days. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=541.234s">I</a>  will preface that by saying that what our current calendar does not actually seem to have is anything related to snow days. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=551.662s">The</a>  current process as I understand it is that the <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=555.467s">superintendent,</a>  and I don't know if this is across the whole state or just a historical Medford thing, but seven snow days are built into our calendar each year. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=565.753s">And</a>  other than Snowmageddon five years, six years ago, there's just been no need for such a massive number of days added into the calendar. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=579.901s">So</a>  I, <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=583.472s">What</a>  I'm proposing in this is that we add the two Eid, and I probably should have learned how to say them before, Al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha, as well as Lunar New Year as full-blown, moving them from the excused absence list to being a no school type of observance beginning in the 2022-2023 school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=606.896s">We've</a>  already released the calendar for this year, so I don't think it would be, <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=613.352s">possible</a>  to make that kind of a change, considering we won't even be actually discussing this until the 14th, if it passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=622.298s">So,</a>  Member Graham, do you have any commentary before I go to the other folks?</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=630.063s">I</a>  see Dr. Cushing has his hand in the air, so I'll have to defer to him.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=634.546s">Dr.</a>  Cushing.</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=636.761s">I</a>  only wanted to say that the five days that it's state law that you actually build those into your calendar or state regulation from DESE that you have to schedule for 185 days of school while required to have 180. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=652.095s">So</a>  those five days are supposed to be on your calendar.</p>
