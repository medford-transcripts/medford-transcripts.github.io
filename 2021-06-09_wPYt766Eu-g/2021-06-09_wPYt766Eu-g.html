    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=54.861s">Hi,</a>  everyone.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=57.585s">Hello.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=59.647s">You</a>  know, let me just check in with Member McLaughlin real quick, because I know that she may not be able to make it. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=89.579s">Hi,</a>  everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=90.221s">Sorry</a>  for the delay. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=91.184s">We're</a>  just waiting to see if one more member will join us. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=94.734s">And</a>  if she can't, we can start without her. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=155.77s">All</a>  right, I think we should get started. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=158.692s">Wait</a>  a second, I just see she just got the message. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=162.994s">All</a>  right, well, we'll get started. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=177.722s">I'm</a>  gonna actually share my screen out so that I can see you and do the, <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=186.247s">You</a>  can share. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=190.968s">Click</a>  on the wrong part of that little share icon every time. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=193.969s">All</a>  right, Chrome. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=211.025s">All</a>  right, it's 4.03. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=212.386s">Thank</a>  you all for coming tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=213.866s">I'm</a>  going to call to order the Rules Policy and Equity Subcommittee meeting of the Medford School Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=221.83s">And</a>  then I will get to the, actually, do I read the agenda first or after I take attendance? <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=226.551s">I</a>  always forget that. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=227.532s">Does</a>  it matter?</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=230.013s">I</a>  think you read this first and then do attendance.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=231.733s">Okay,</a>  thank you, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=233.934s">So</a>  this is to all interested parties from me and the other members. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=239.42s">Please</a>  be advised that on Wednesday, June 9 2021 from four to 6pm there will be a rules policy and equity subcommittee meeting held through remote participation via zoom pursuant to Governor, we probably need to get this language updated as I'm reading it since I think these ended right, or, but I'll just read it anyways because that's what's on the agenda but pursuant to Governor Baker's March 12 2020 order suspending certain provisions of the open meeting law. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=264.266s">and</a>  the governor's March 15th, 2020 orders imposing strict limitations on the number of people that may gather in one place. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=269.767s">This</a>  meeting of the Medford School Committee will be conducted via remote participation to the greatest extent possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=275.128s">Specific</a>  information and the general guidelines for remote participation by members of the public and or parties with a right and or requirement to attend this meeting can be found on the City of Medford website. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=287.55s">For</a>  this meeting, members of the public who wish to listen or watch the meeting may do so by accessing the meeting link contained herein. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=293.865s">No</a>  in-person attendance of members of the public will be permitted, but every effort will be made to ensure that the public can adequately access the proceedings in real time via technological means. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=303.147s">In</a>  the event that we are unable to do so, despite best efforts, we will post on the City of Medford or Medford Community Media website an audio or video recording, transcript, or other comprehensive record of proceedings as soon as possible after the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=318.421s">The</a>  meeting can be viewed through Medford Community Media on channel Comcast channel 22, Verizon channel 43 at four o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=325.224s">Since</a>  the meeting will be held remotely, participants can log in or call in by using the following links or call in number. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=331.767s">The</a>  Zoom is https://nps02155-org.zoom.us slash j slash 96851394965. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=345.936s">Or</a>  you can call in by dialing 1312-626-6799. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=348.798s">And</a>  the meeting ID is 9685134965. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=349.719s">Additionally,</a>  questions or comments can be submitted during the meeting by emailing me at pruseau at medford.k12.ma.us. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=373.41s">The</a>  submitting must include the following information, your first and last name, your Medford Street address, your question and or comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=381.892s">I</a>  will take the attendance now. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=385.013s">Member</a>  Graham.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=388.854s">Here.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=390.294s">Member</a>  McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=392.094s">I</a>  don't know if she is here. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=393.375s">I'll</a>  mark her absent for now. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=395.715s">And</a>  Member Ruseau, here to present, we have Quorum. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=398.898s">All</a>  right, so our agenda for tonight we have three items. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=402.021s">The</a>  first one is to review policy I see I see a the school year calendar which we actually just approved in December of 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=410.528s">And</a>  during that somewhat lengthy process we we acknowledge that we. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=418.247s">probably</a>  weren't gonna get it exactly right the first time out, cause it was a pretty substantial change from past practice. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=424.548s">We</a>  created something we call variable date observances. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=428.93s">Actually,</a>  I'll bring that policy up. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=434.031s">So</a>  we created, let me scroll down to that part, it's up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=441.015s">So</a>  we've created three different categories for each of the items on the observance list. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=445.916s">We</a>  have no school days, which I think everybody knows what a no school day is, an excused absence day, which is not new, and a blocked day, which means that we are essentially forbidding school-related events that are school-sponsored to occur on those days, in particular, major tests and exams, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=471.655s">And</a>  then, so that, I take it back. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=474.737s">Those</a>  three types of categories existed already. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=477.899s">They</a>  were not explicit in the old policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=480.9s">What</a>  we have also done here is we've created an observance list that will help the superintendent roll this out each November. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=490.746s">We</a>  have what we call static date observances. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=492.967s">So</a>  date observances that occur on a specific date, kind of obvious. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=497.866s">And</a>  then there's a whole host of observances that occur on different kinds of calendars, whether it's a lunar calendar or I believe the, well, I don't know all the different calendars. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=513.015s">I</a>  won't pretend to know all that, but these are all calendar types, observance types that actually have a different date each year. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=520.28s">So</a>  they have to kind of be looked up before they can be put into the calendar. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=526.303s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=528.105s">We</a>  are here to discuss the addition, if that's how the members here and then the full school committee wants to go, of three additional days. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=541.234s">I</a>  will preface that by saying that what our current calendar does not actually seem to have is anything related to snow days. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=551.662s">The</a>  current process as I understand it is that the <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=555.467s">superintendent,</a>  and I don't know if this is across the whole state or just a historical Medford thing, but seven snow days are built into our calendar each year. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=565.753s">And</a>  other than Snowmageddon five years, six years ago, there's just been no need for such a massive number of days added into the calendar. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=579.901s">So</a>  I, <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=583.472s">What</a>  I'm proposing in this is that we add the two Eid, and I probably should have learned how to say them before, Al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha, as well as Lunar New Year as full-blown, moving them from the excused absence list to being a no school type of observance beginning in the 2022-2023 school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=606.896s">We've</a>  already released the calendar for this year, so I don't think it would be, <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=613.352s">possible</a>  to make that kind of a change, considering we won't even be actually discussing this until the 14th, if it passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=622.298s">So,</a>  Member Graham, do you have any commentary before I go to the other folks?</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=630.063s">I</a>  see Dr. Cushing has his hand in the air, so I'll have to defer to him.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=634.546s">Dr.</a>  Cushing.</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=636.761s">I</a>  only wanted to say that the five days that it's state law that you actually build those into your calendar or state regulation from DESE that you have to schedule for 185 days of school while required to have 180. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=652.095s">So</a>  those five days are supposed to be on your calendar.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=657.207s">And</a>  Dr. Cushing, we currently scheduled for seven, is that right?</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=661.233s">No,</a>  I think I've only seen five on our current calendar. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=665.18s">It's</a>  just on the other side of my office. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=675.628s">Uh,</a>  so right now, as of now, we will get out next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=680.411s">Um,</a>  if all goes well and there were no snow days, we will get out on the summer solstice, June 21st. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=688.135s">Um,</a>  the five days, um, it's, it ends up being seven calendar days when you do the five school days. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=694.799s">Um,</a>  then we will be out on June 28th. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=697.44s">Got</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=702.941s">if</a>  we enact those five days. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=705.503s">If</a>  we were to add three days, just take for a hypothetical here, I'm not offering any commentary. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=712.888s">I'm</a>  only saying if we were to add another three days of no school, and we did have five snow days, <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=721.362s">we</a>  would be unable to fulfill the 180 day requirement based on where the dates fall next year, as just a hypothetical, because right now, after those five days, there's only the 29th and the 30th. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=739.108s">And</a>  any snow day prior to April 1st has to be made up per DESI.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=749.271s">Okay,</a>  so, <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=751.392s">One</a>  thing I didn't do was physically bring a calendar to this is one of those times when paper can be very helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=759.517s">So,</a>  can you can you just be a little more clear like if we added three days and then had the five days that literally is impossible.</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=770.766s">Well,</a>  based on next year's calendar, what I'm looking at, we only have two additional days, the 28th and the, I'm sorry, the 29th and the 30th of June available. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=782.653s">So</a>  if we were to go through five snow days and next year had an additional three days off, we essentially would have one unaccounted for day because we would be at June 30th based on, just based on the initial glance of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=800.857s">I'm</a>  not saying, and please, I'm not saying.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=803.558s">No,</a>  I know you're not offering an opinion actually on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=806.399s">I</a>  guess, one of the other challenges with the variable date observances and we have, is that some of these dates in some years will land when we don't have school. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=828.269s">So</a>  it's one of those things where, <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=831.438s">We</a>  don't want a policy that some years works and some years doesn't work, obviously, because then the superintendent's gonna have to come to us in November and say, I followed the policy, we have to go to school until July 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=845.687s">Or</a>  worst case, July 3rd, if Monday is, if the first were a Saturday, for instance.</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=851.05s">You</a>  do not under state law go into fiscal year.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=855.813s">No,</a>  no, yeah, no, I know. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=856.913s">I</a>  mean, if the superintendent followed the policy, played it all out, <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=861.678s">and</a>  was like, we don't have a calendar that can be approved because of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=867.54s">I</a>  don't want the policy to be functional most years, but on occasion, not functional. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=874.883s">That's</a>  sort of my point. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=877.944s">You</a>  know, Juneteenth this year, for instance, is on a Saturday. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=881.825s">And</a>  we got lucky because Juneteenth was added after our last calendar was approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=887.867s">And</a>  it's the no school day if it had been <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=893.308s">Any</a>  of the six other days of the week, we would have had to use a snow day, essentially, because we would have had to take it off, but the last calendar did not consider it. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=906.974s">Okay,</a>  so two days right now is the maximum is what I'm hearing we can fit, unless we are going to address the bigger issue of February vacation, which I don't think we can cover tonight, because it's not on the agenda, but also because <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=923.376s">It's</a>  a multi-community effort is how I understand other communities have addressed the February vacation problem.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=930.622s">And</a>  remember, so I would like to hear if there's anyone who has joined us who has thoughts about these particular holidays.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=941.35s">Absolutely,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=944.342s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=944.522s">Weiss,</a>  if you could just notate that Member McLaughlin has joined us and I see a hand up. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=950.929s">Michael,</a>  could you state your name and address or just your Medford Street address for the record, please? <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=959.018s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=962.281s">Oops,</a>  I might've muted you or unmuted you.</p>

    <p>[Bernstein]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=972.428s">Hi,</a>  Michael Bernstein, Lyman Avenue, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=975.75s">Thank</a>  you for allowing me the opportunity to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=978.331s">I</a>  wanted to just clarify, while June 19th is on a weekend this coming school year, it's being observed as a closed school day, as a no school day on the 20th. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=989.797s">So</a>  that did actually affect the calendar for next year, unless there's some other reason why June 20th is designated as a no school day.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=997.0s">Sorry,</a>  Michael. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1001.311s">the</a>  2021 calendar year, the 19th is on a Saturday and the state law for state holidays is that Saturday holidays just are Saturday holidays. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1013.937s">Sunday</a>  holidays roll on to being a Monday holiday and then there's a couple of exceptions like Christmas and I don't know what else it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1022.941s">Next</a>  year, <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1024.598s">is</a>  I think what you're talking about.</p>

    <p>[Bernstein]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1026.54s">Yes,</a>  next year is what I was talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1028.863s">I</a>  also wanted to point out that of the three holidays that you're considering adding, one of them is currently for the coming year would be in July and would not be a school day. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1041.776s">And</a>  that some of the other dates that are also moving dates such as Rosh Hashanah, the first day, <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1047.401s">and</a>  Yom Kippur that have been newly designated as no school days will sometimes be on weekends, as will some of these other dates that you're considering adding. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1056.948s">So</a>  I think that worrying about the very rare case where every one of those dates would be a school date and you would therefore run into the end of the year, I suspect we're gonna run into years like Snowmageddon more often than that, where that starts to affect the calendar. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1075.01s">And</a>  it feels like that could be dealt with, especially if you're approving the calendar typically in November of the year before, that that would be recognized well in advance to be able to start to adjust how you're going to handle professional development days and adjust the calendar as needed then. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1091.408s">While</a>  I've got the mic for a second, I just wanted to voice my support for adding these holidays as no school days based on my understanding that these are important communities that celebrate these holidays. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1102.492s">While</a>  they're not my holidays, two of the holidays that were recently added to the no school list are my holidays. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1109.375s">And</a>  the fact that those were added was incredibly meaningful and important to my family as recognition of the diversity in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1115.457s">So</a>  thank you very much.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1118.762s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1119.542s">And</a>  I appreciate also the sort of threading that needle of, you know, I have not sat down and tried to play out, which it would not be hard to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1130.344s">Well,</a>  it would be tedious, but it would not be hard to like play out the next 10 years of these and find out, do we really run into a problem or not? <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1138.966s">And</a>  actually thinking about that and the way you talked about how, you know, there'll be things that end up in July, <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1145.637s">or</a>  things that are, you know, something could end up in February vacation or some other already declared non-school time, that maybe we just simply add something to the policy to say, you know, in the event that the policy creates a, the policy as written cannot create enough school days to meet state compliance, that the school committee will be <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1175.187s">uh,</a>  consulted on how to proceed. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1177.769s">Um,</a>  you know, I don't really look forward to trying to figure out, well, whose holiday do we cut this year? <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1183.733s">Um,</a>  but, um, I, you know, I know that I certainly played out a number of these when we were writing the policy and it was interesting to see, you know, cause I, I observed no holidays that are lunar holidays. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1198.664s">So</a>  it was just so fascinating to see how well they move. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1202.898s">I</a>  mean, everybody who follows those kinds of holidays know this. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1206.64s">But</a>  anybody else want to have something to say on this? <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1212.963s">Barbara</a>  Graham, I see you muted.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1215.124s">Yeah,</a>  so I was actually trying to look at the calendar as we were talking. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1220.066s">And</a>  for example, for the 2022-2023 school year, these holidays all occur in 2023. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1223.347s">The</a>  Lunar New Year is on a Sunday. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1234.518s">one</a>  of the holidays is I believe on 4-21. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1238.339s">But</a>  I, hold on a second, did I do that wrong? <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1247.223s">On</a>  4-21, which if I am like eyeballing that correctly would fall within April vacation often. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1256.746s">So</a>  that's right around that timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1258.346s">And</a>  then the final one is on <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1260.08s">Wednesday,</a>  June 28th, which could actually sort of be outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1264.363s">So</a>  I think, you know, one thing we could consider is adding these holidays and, you know, amending the policy to say that, you know, when the superintendent presents the calendar in November of every year, we need to look with, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1286.313s">know,</a>  we need to look at the impact of the full schedule and determine whether we have a contention issue with snow days. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1296.12s">And</a>  I think the other sort of thing that I'm thinking about is wanting to understand <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1305.883s">know</a>  if there are other districts out there that are using holidays like this in a flexible manner for staff where we might be able to provide time for students in a unilateral way but provide <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1323.842s">flexible</a>  professional development for staff with the thought that like the same staff member is likely not going to observe Good Friday and Yom Kippur, for example, or Good Friday and Rosh Hashanah, you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1340.328s">So</a>  there might be, you know, there just might be some other creative options, which I don't think we can necessarily like get to the bottom of in this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1349.012s">And</a>  they obviously have like <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1351.157s">impacts</a>  across our ecosystem, but maybe there are other creative ways to think about some of that stuff if we can get some feedback from the group that's here and perhaps from our colleagues on Monday night around the directional way we might go and <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1376.798s">present</a>  some questions to the administration to sort of come back to us with in September, because again, we're not enacting this, this set of changes would not take effect for an entire year. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1386.768s">So</a>  we could, you know, talk about draft changes and what the challenges are, what the opportunities are with those changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1399.792s">in</a>  terms of recognizing holidays that are really important to members of our community and then pose a series of questions to the administration for a little bit of like digging and research on their end around some other options. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1411.457s">That's</a>  something that I've been thinking about as we've been talking about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1416.779s">And</a>  I just, I think the other thing that's like really top of mind for me at the moment is <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1424.105s">just</a>  how hot it's been in this last week, and that's not going to be getting better. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1429.59s">So</a>  as we are adding holidays, we are making decisions to extend the school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1436.036s">And</a>  in an extreme weather year, we could be right up to the end of June 30th. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1443.423s">And</a>  so maybe that is worthy of discussion in its own right to say, <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1448.989s">We</a>  didn't talk about or revisit any of the things that we have always done, and maybe we could or we should as a part of this discussion in a larger way at the beginning of the next school year.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1467.663s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1468.123s">Horia</a>  Jalabi, could you just state your name and address for the record, just your street address for the record, please?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1477.09s">Hi,</a>  my name is Haria Chalabi, and my address is 57 Washington Street, Apartment 9, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1484.434s">Thank</a>  you for allowing me to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1487.355s">So</a>  I'm going to talk about our holidays, Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha, just to give you an idea how it goes with our holidays. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1496.399s">So</a>  we follow lunar year, and every year, <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1502.529s">is</a>  going to be a different day. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1504.211s">So</a>  like this year, Eid al-Adha was on May 13. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1511.518s">So</a>  next year is going to be like 10 days ahead of that day. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1517.623s">And</a>  yeah, and for another district that they are using, they have also been <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1528.908s">No</a>  days on these holidays is Cambridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1531.71s">They</a>  have been having, they have a calendar where many, there is many holidays that are no school. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1541.717s">And</a>  I think they start their school year on September 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1546.14s">And</a>  the last day of school is June 23rd. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1550.163s">So</a>  they are, I think they are the only district they have these holidays on their calendar. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1558.764s">And</a>  I know I think Boston are working on also having them on the calendar right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1564.386s">And</a>  I hope Metro too.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1570.229s">Thank</a>  you, Maria.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1571.27s">Thank</a>  you, Maria.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1577.592s">One</a>  second. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1585.956s">Can't</a>  see the whole name because of Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1588.65s">But</a>  Humayun, I'm gonna unmute you if you'd like to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1592.512s">If</a>  you could say your name and street address. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1597.194s">Hello?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1598.215s">Hello.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1598.515s">Nope,</a>  we made a joke. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1602.237s">Let's</a>  try that again. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1607.44s">Okay,</a>  I think we should be able to hear you now.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1609.861s">Hello?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1610.401s">Oh,</a>  hi, can you hear me?</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1611.782s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1613.403s">Oh,</a>  hi, my name is Humayun Moshe. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1617.084s">My</a>  address is 30 St. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1618.806s">Francis</a>  Street, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1620.607s">And</a>  also, I represent the Islamic Cultural Center of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1626.471s">I'm</a>  the president of the organization as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1629.033s">So,</a>  on behalf of the Muslim community, I'd like to say thank you for considering our holidays. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1634.837s">But</a>  also, we're not going to compromise the mandatory school days. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1641.95s">We</a>  like to be flexible. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1643.351s">We're</a>  not, I mean, we're not going to cut any school days. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1647.974s">That's</a>  the priority number one, but we could be flexible also. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1652.097s">So</a>  I understand, I agree, whatever the discussions in future day change, we could be, you know, we get advance notice to the school committee or the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1664.606s">So</a>  that way we can arrange the <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1667.468s">and</a>  we'll be flexible, but we're not saying we have to do it, but if you guys consider, that'll be really appreciated on behalf of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1676.834s">Thank</a>  you, that's all I wanna mention.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1679.296s">Thank</a>  you, Humayun. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1683.859s">Melanie's</a>  got a thumbs up, but I don't know if she wants to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1687.742s">Zoom</a>  sometimes is funky that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1692.085s">Member</a>  McLaughlin, did you wanna speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1693.646s">Let</a>  me unmute you, I don't know if you're a host.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1696.931s">No,</a>  member Rousseau, I'm actually not able to thank you.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1701.436s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1703.839s">I</a>  just wanted to say thank you to Horia as well for pointing us to Cambridge Public Schools because they might be a useful model for us to talk to as well about how they <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1716.28s">are</a>  managing all of this inside of their calendar. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1719.162s">So</a>  thank you for pointing us in the right direction instead of having us sort of have to cast a wide net of our school committee colleagues across the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1728.067s">So</a>  we can check in with them for sure.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1731.209s">Yes,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1731.99s">I</a>  do appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1735.572s">I've</a>  talked about the February vacation a couple of times about how teachers just get back from the winter break <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1745.85s">slash</a>  Christmas break, and then they start going, and then boom, everybody's out for another week. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1752.677s">My</a>  understanding is teachers do not like February vacation. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1756.0s">And</a>  I'm sure that saying that implies all teachers think the same thing, which is not exactly very useful, but that it's not an uncommon opinion from teachers that February vacation is just, <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1770.74s">not</a>  good for academics and for continued work. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1776.162s">But</a>  in my conversations, I think with Dr. Cushing, or maybe it was Dr. Murphy, Mr. Murphy, I forget all the right doctors. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1787.127s">It's</a>  a problem that is best resolved sort of regionally. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1793.65s">We</a>  don't want to require our teachers to come to school in February when <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1800.089s">All</a>  of those with children are in districts where they are home. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1807.175s">You</a>  know, we just want to try not to create a childcare crisis every single February. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1812.6s">And,</a>  you know, another community could do it to us too. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1815.042s">And</a>  so I think it makes sense to broach that conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1821.429s">in</a>  another setting or the superintendent, of course, has, you know, regional contacts with all of the districts around us, you know, around calling snow days and all this other stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1834.518s">So</a>  I just want everybody to know that is something that we have talked about, but it's actually much more complicated than, certainly than I had considered, you know, living and working in the same town. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1851.238s">Maria,</a>  would you like to speak again?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1853.22s">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1857.363s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1858.083s">So</a>  I think it's doable. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1860.785s">We</a>  can add holidays, at least to one of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1864.048s">I</a>  mean, I'm talking about our holidays. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1867.971s">I'm</a>  not familiar with other holidays. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1870.853s">And</a>  yeah, the thing is, like this year, I can't tell you how it went this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1877.151s">So</a>  this year, MCAS was, I know it was a mess this year and everybody was doing their best, but it's good to hear from our perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1887.313s">So</a>  this year, they were MCAS scheduled on May 13th, on the day of our holiday. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1895.835s">I</a>  know some families, they don't know that they can opt out their kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1900.506s">And</a>  they, you know, there's this anxiety that, oh no, I'm not gonna let this, my kid to miss test or, and, you know, I know some families, you know, they still attend classes on that day, even though they have the right to take absence that day. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1918.241s">And</a>  they, some may not, they have like language barrier, some may don't, they are not, <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1926.598s">familiar</a>  with the school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1928.599s">I</a>  have been in the United States for a long time, but still, every time I'm learning things with my oldest son. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1935.901s">So</a>  I'm sure other families that they have kids from my community, they are not familiar with some school systems rules and what they can, if they can, like MCAS, they can opt out or they <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1956.927s">you</a>  know, they can make it another day. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1959.209s">So,</a>  since we're talking about holidays, not only if we can add it's no school day, it make it easy for families to just focus on this holiday. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1971.357s">And,</a>  you know, like me, like personally, even though I sent an email to some teachers and some like, you know, the school, I still had one of the teachers sent my son notification that you're not at school. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1986.946s">and</a>  you, you haven't done your work. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1990.049s">I</a>  was like, I had to, you know, my son, my son didn't know what to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1994.052s">So</a>  I had to, you know, email them back and say, it's our holiday. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=1997.755s">And</a>  you know, he's not, he's not at school and he's not supposed to have to worry about any project or homework today. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2007.203s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2009.009s">You</a>  know, we still have, you know, we still, even though there is absence, excuse absence, but there is homework, there are projects, especially if they are in middle school and up, they still have to do some work on that day. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2022.098s">Some</a>  work are due the other day, some work, you know, so it's still challenging and, you know, for our, like our communities and parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2035.928s">Yeah,</a>  that's the thing that I wanted to share with you.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2040.589s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2042.289s">Yes,</a>  I mean, I will just say that this new policy is new this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2047.23s">And</a>  I think I know that I have heard from, I think two principals separately, how much they appreciated this, that it was all written down as in one place. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2060.073s">And,</a>  you know, there's no, <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2062.58s">expectation</a>  that all the teachers are out there trying to figure out, you know, I mean, I have my calendar and my computer and sometimes I'm like, I thought today was a holiday. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2074.109s">And</a>  then other times, you know, I just looked at Juneteenth and it says at the top Juneteenth five times, like, I don't know why there's five Juneteenths in my calendar. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2082.795s">So,</a>  you know, to expect all of the teachers to just figure it all out every year has sort of kind of, has been sort of the past practice. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2092.152s">Now</a>  there's one document that says it all and explains it all. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2095.653s">And</a>  I know that the superintendent was very thankful when we passed that policy because I won't say it makes things easier, it makes things clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2104.796s">And</a>  that I think is really critical. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2110.718s">Does</a>  anybody else have any?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2112.659s">Thank</a>  you, Paul. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2113.279s">I</a>  really appreciate this. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2115.84s">I</a>  know it has been hard and it's good <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2119.228s">I</a>  really appreciate communication between parents and school. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2123.129s">I</a>  think that's how we can make a better school environment for kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2129.41s">And</a>  we all working together to improve school for our kids.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2139.833s">And</a>  Horia, I think one of the things that is definitely true starting next year is that <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2149.012s">there</a>  will be no testing allowed on your holidays. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2153.054s">So</a>  hopefully this year being the mess that it has been for lots of reasons, was an anomaly and that at minimum next year, we will have clear guidance about tests and projects and homework in place while we figure out how to, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2173.404s">be</a>  equally respectful of all of the religious holidays that the folks in Medford celebrate, you know, whoever they might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2183.452s">So</a>  even if this is sort of tricky and complicated and maybe gonna take some time, I feel better that we have put some things in place to make some significant <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2198.29s">clarifying</a>  moves for next year, but even though we may just need to keep working at this for a bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2207.554s">So</a>  I hope that there's a way for us as we go into next year and the superintendent continues her communications that when the holidays come up, <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2221.183s">that</a>  are sort of in this block mode where there is school, but there are restrictions on what can happen in school that we can find a good proactive way to reach families in their native language so that they know what is expected or not expected and what choices and options they have, as you point out. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2246.393s">So</a>  I think that will be really important next year.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2250.282s">That</a>  would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2250.902s">Thank</a>  you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2252.542s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2256.483s">Was</a>  anybody else like to speak on this? <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2261.584s">I,</a>  in the meeting, I wrote a, is it one sentence? <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2265.565s">One</a>  sentence as a potential amendment to the policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2269.726s">Member</a>  Graham, I presume you can see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2271.426s">I</a>  will read it for Member McLaughlin because I believe she may not be able to see the Zoom right now, but I added to the <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2279.05s">our</a>  school year calendar policy, a sentence under the policy section says, in the event that this policy creates a situation where we will have an insufficient number of school days, the superintendent will bring this to the school committee for advice on how to proceed to ensure the minimum 180 school days. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2297.304s">It</a>  feels a little clunky, that sentence at the end. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2299.966s">What</a>  do you think, Memorandum? <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2304.689s">Any</a>  thoughts that sound good? <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2306.56s">It's</a>  clear, right?</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2307.321s">I</a>  make the motion to approve.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2308.862s">I</a>  think the only thing we need to add is the minimum of 180 school days and 185 scheduled days, just so it's clear that we have to schedule 185 days.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2322.953s">Okay,</a>  I think that's a good point, because I did start the meeting earlier by saying there's nothing in here about snow days. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2329.238s">So</a>  I'm sure the minimum 180 school days <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2335.573s">and</a>  185 scheduled school days per the, I'm gonna bet it's in CMR 27, but per the state requirement to include five. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2358.591s">Are</a>  they called inclement weather days or snow days, Dr. Edwards-Vincent, do you know?</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2365.557s">I</a>  think you can list it as inclement weather, because it could be, you know, a bad event, you know, a tornado or something. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2375.261s">So,</a>  yes.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2376.922s">Okay,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2379.883s">So</a>  I added that little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2381.563s">Member</a>  McLaughlin, did you want to motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2383.404s">Oh,</a>  Mr. Kane wants to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2385.645s">Let</a>  me unmute you. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2388.186s">Nick,</a>  hello. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2390.027s">Hello.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2390.627s">Name</a>  and street address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2393.738s">My</a>  name's Nick Kane. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2394.619s">I'm</a>  actually a teacher at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2397.482s">And</a>  so I was just attending out of an interest in the conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2402.506s">And</a>  I heard you mentioned earlier, if we could look forward in the upcoming years when these, when holidays that move would both fall in a weekday. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2411.455s">And</a>  so I just did a little quick research and I might be off on some of these, but it looks like in the next three years, <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2420.102s">between</a>  the 22, 23 school year and 24, 25, the Lunar New Year and Abe would not both fall on a school day. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2429.745s">And</a>  same for, it's actually for five of the next six years that it looks as though they would be split between a weekend day and a regular day, just for planning purposes going forward.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2440.708s">Great,</a>  thank you, I appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2442.069s">Yeah,</a>  one of the challenges is you have to kind of schedule all of the days <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2446.602s">for</a>  a year, and then you can do the math. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2448.904s">And</a>  I suppose if I had done a little more due diligence, I might have actually done that, and I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2454.849s">I</a>  guess I didn't really understand that we could not pull back any of our inclement weather days. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2460.253s">That</a>  was sort of my out. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2463.535s">But</a>  that appears to not be an option. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2465.557s">So</a>  member McLaughlin, are you- Motion to approve.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2470.02s">Can</a>  you hear me, Paul? <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2470.881s">I</a>  said motion to approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2471.802s">I</a>  can, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2472.603s">Yes,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2473.183s">Yeah,</a>  second.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2473.503s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2476.35s">I</a>  will take the roll call on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2480.013s">And</a>  that is just the amendment to the policy, by the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2482.655s">So</a>  that member Graham.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2485.037s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2486.358s">Member</a>  McLaughlin.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2487.819s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2489.52s">So</a>  yes, three in the affirmative. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2491.242s">The</a>  amendment to the policy regarding the situation where there are insufficient number of days using the policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2499.708s">So</a>  now I think we should vote on whether or not we wish to <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2506.703s">Motion</a>  to approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2510.145s">Member</a>  Graham.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2513.086s">Member</a>  Ruseau, we also have Mr. Kane again, but we do have a motion on the floor.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2517.208s">I</a>  think his hand just didn't come down. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2518.428s">And</a>  so the motion, right, is to add these three as no school days beginning in 2022, 2023. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2528.073s">And</a>  for anybody watching, this is just the subcommittee recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2531.714s">The</a>  full committee will surely have an opinion and conversation on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2536.63s">Is</a>  there a second?</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wPYt766Eu-g&t=2538.752s">Second.</a> </p>
