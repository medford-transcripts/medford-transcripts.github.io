1
00:00:54,861 --> 00:00:55,342
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:57,585 --> 00:00:58,105
[SPEAKER_12]: Hello.

3
00:00:59,647 --> 00:01:11,824
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, let me just check in with Member McLaughlin real quick, because I know that she may not be able to make it.

4
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:30,101
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, everyone.

5
00:01:30,221 --> 00:01:31,144
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry for the delay.

6
00:01:31,184 --> 00:01:33,671
[SPEAKER_11]: We're just waiting to see if one more member will join us.

7
00:01:34,734 --> 00:01:36,480
[SPEAKER_11]: And if she can't, we can start without her.

8
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:38,672
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, I think we should get started.

9
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:42,974
[SPEAKER_12]: Wait a second, I just see she just got the message.

10
00:02:42,994 --> 00:02:56,962
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, well, we'll get started.

11
00:02:57,722 --> 00:03:02,785
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm gonna actually share my screen out so that I can see you and do the,

12
00:03:06,247 --> 00:03:06,927
[SPEAKER_10]: You can share.

13
00:03:10,968 --> 00:03:13,949
[SPEAKER_10]: Click on the wrong part of that little share icon every time.

14
00:03:13,969 --> 00:03:16,190
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, Chrome.

15
00:03:17,671 --> 00:03:17,831
Good.

16
00:03:31,025 --> 00:03:31,866
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, it's 4.03.

17
00:03:32,386 --> 00:03:33,646
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you all for coming tonight.

18
00:03:33,866 --> 00:03:39,889
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to call to order the Rules Policy and Equity Subcommittee meeting of the Medford School Committee.

19
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:46,491
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I will get to the, actually, do I read the agenda first or after I take attendance?

20
00:03:46,551 --> 00:03:47,512
[SPEAKER_11]: I always forget that.

21
00:03:47,532 --> 00:03:49,473
[SPEAKER_11]: Does it matter?

22
00:03:50,013 --> 00:03:51,713
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you read this first and then do attendance.

23
00:03:51,733 --> 00:03:52,634
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, thank you, sorry.

24
00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:57,796
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is to all interested parties from me and the other members.

[SPEAKER_11]: Please be advised that on Wednesday, June 9 2021 from four to 6pm there will be a rules policy and equity subcommittee meeting held through remote participation via zoom pursuant to Governor, we probably need to get this language updated as I'm reading it since I think these ended right, or, but I'll just read it anyways because that's what's on the agenda but pursuant to Governor Baker's March 12 2020 order suspending certain provisions of the open meeting law.

26
00:04:24,266 --> 00:04:29,707

[SPEAKER_05]: Here.

42
00:06:30,294 --> 00:06:31,534
[SPEAKER_11]: Member McLaughlin.

43
00:06:32,094 --> 00:06:33,355
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if she is here.

44
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:35,655
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll mark her absent for now.

45
00:06:35,715 --> 00:06:38,236
[SPEAKER_11]: And Member Rousseau, here to present, we have Quorum.

46
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:41,680
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, so our agenda for tonight we have three items.

47
00:06:42,021 --> 00:06:50,348
[SPEAKER_11]: The first one is to review policy I see I see a the school year calendar which we actually just approved in December of 2020.

48
00:06:50,528 --> 00:06:56,713
[SPEAKER_11]: And during that somewhat lengthy process we we acknowledge that we.

49
00:06:58,247 --> 00:07:03,568
[SPEAKER_11]: probably weren't gonna get it exactly right the first time out, cause it was a pretty substantial change from past practice.

50
00:07:04,548 --> 00:07:08,910
[SPEAKER_11]: We created something we call variable date observances.

51
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:11,650
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, I'll bring that policy up.

52
00:07:14,031 --> 00:07:19,212
[SPEAKER_11]: So we created, let me scroll down to that part, it's up here.

53
00:07:21,015 --> 00:07:25,696
[SPEAKER_11]: So we've created three different categories for each of the items on the observance list.

54
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:50,500
[SPEAKER_11]: We have no school days, which I think everybody knows what a no school day is, an excused absence day, which is not new, and a blocked day, which means that we are essentially forbidding school-related events that are school-sponsored to occur on those days, in particular, major tests and exams, et cetera.

55
00:07:51,655 --> 00:07:54,717
[SPEAKER_11]: And then, so that, I take it back.

56
00:07:54,737 --> 00:07:57,839
[SPEAKER_11]: Those three types of categories existed already.

57
00:07:57,899 --> 00:07:59,820
[SPEAKER_11]: They were not explicit in the old policy.

58
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:09,705
[SPEAKER_11]: What we have also done here is we've created an observance list that will help the superintendent roll this out each November.

59
00:08:10,746 --> 00:08:12,867
[SPEAKER_11]: We have what we call static date observances.

60
00:08:12,967 --> 00:08:16,829
[SPEAKER_11]: So date observances that occur on a specific date, kind of obvious.

61
00:08:17,866 --> 00:08:32,955
[SPEAKER_11]: And then there's a whole host of observances that occur on different kinds of calendars, whether it's a lunar calendar or I believe the, well, I don't know all the different calendars.

62
00:08:33,015 --> 00:08:40,220
[SPEAKER_11]: I won't pretend to know all that, but these are all calendar types, observance types that actually have a different date each year.

63
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:43,702
[SPEAKER_11]: So they have to kind of be looked up before they can be put into the calendar.

64
00:08:46,303 --> 00:08:46,483
[SPEAKER_11]: So,

65
00:08:48,105 --> 00:09:00,554
[SPEAKER_11]: We are here to discuss the addition, if that's how the members here and then the full school committee wants to go, of three additional days.

66
00:09:01,234 --> 00:09:09,640
[SPEAKER_11]: I will preface that by saying that what our current calendar does not actually seem to have is anything related to snow days.

67
00:09:11,662 --> 00:09:14,664
[SPEAKER_11]: The current process as I understand it is that the

68
00:09:15,467 --> 00:09:25,733
[SPEAKER_11]: superintendent, and I don't know if this is across the whole state or just a historical Medford thing, but seven snow days are built into our calendar each year.

69
00:09:25,753 --> 00:09:39,381
[SPEAKER_11]: And other than Snowmageddon five years, six years ago, there's just been no need for such a massive number of days added into the calendar.

70
00:09:39,901 --> 00:09:40,482
[SPEAKER_11]: So I,

71
00:09:43,472 --> 00:10:06,836
[SPEAKER_11]: What I'm proposing in this is that we add the two Eid, and I probably should have learned how to say them before, Al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha, as well as Lunar New Year as full-blown, moving them from the excused absence list to being a no school type of observance beginning in the 2022-2023 school year.

72
00:10:06,896 --> 00:10:11,277
[SPEAKER_11]: We've already released the calendar for this year, so I don't think it would be,

73
00:10:13,352 --> 00:10:20,137
[SPEAKER_11]: possible to make that kind of a change, considering we won't even be actually discussing this until the 14th, if it passes.

74
00:10:22,298 --> 00:10:27,222
[SPEAKER_11]: So, Member Graham, do you have any commentary before I go to the other folks?

75
00:10:30,063 --> 00:10:33,866
[SPEAKER_02]: I see Dr. Cushing has his hand in the air, so I'll have to defer to him.

76
00:10:34,546 --> 00:10:35,127
[SPEAKER_08]: Dr. Cushing.

77
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:50,794
[SPEAKER_13]: I only wanted to say that the five days that it's state law that you actually build those into your calendar or state regulation from DESE that you have to schedule for 185 days of school while required to have 180.

78
00:10:52,095 --> 00:10:54,818
[SPEAKER_13]: So those five days are supposed to be on your calendar.

79
00:10:57,207 --> 00:11:01,213
[SPEAKER_02]: And Dr. Cushing, we currently scheduled for seven, is that right?

80
00:11:01,233 --> 00:11:05,059
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I think I've only seen five on our current calendar.

81
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,542
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just on the other side of my office.

82
00:11:15,628 --> 00:11:20,391
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, so right now, as of now, we will get out next year.

83
00:11:20,411 --> 00:11:27,375
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, if all goes well and there were no snow days, we will get out on the summer solstice, June 21st.

84
00:11:28,135 --> 00:11:33,938
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, the five days, um, it's, it ends up being seven calendar days when you do the five school days.

85
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:37,420
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, then we will be out on June 28th.

86
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,040
[SPEAKER_13]: Got it.

87
00:11:42,941 --> 00:11:44,802
[SPEAKER_13]: if we enact those five days.

88
00:11:45,503 --> 00:11:52,868
[SPEAKER_13]: If we were to add three days, just take for a hypothetical here, I'm not offering any commentary.

89
00:11:52,888 --> 00:12:00,293
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm only saying if we were to add another three days of no school, and we did have five snow days,

90
00:12:01,362 --> 00:12:18,208
[SPEAKER_13]: we would be unable to fulfill the 180 day requirement based on where the dates fall next year, as just a hypothetical, because right now, after those five days, there's only the 29th and the 30th.

91
00:12:19,108 --> 00:12:23,950
[SPEAKER_13]: And any snow day prior to April 1st has to be made up per DESI.

92
00:12:29,271 --> 00:12:30,052
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so,

93
00:12:31,392 --> 00:12:36,975
[SPEAKER_11]: One thing I didn't do was physically bring a calendar to this is one of those times when paper can be very helpful.

94
00:12:39,517 --> 00:12:49,243
[SPEAKER_11]: So, can you can you just be a little more clear like if we added three days and then had the five days that literally is impossible.

95
00:12:50,766 --> 00:13:02,493
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, based on next year's calendar, what I'm looking at, we only have two additional days, the 28th and the, I'm sorry, the 29th and the 30th of June available.

96
00:13:02,653 --> 00:13:19,042
[SPEAKER_13]: So if we were to go through five snow days and next year had an additional three days off, we essentially would have one unaccounted for day because we would be at June 30th based on, just based on the initial glance of this.

97
00:13:20,857 --> 00:13:22,518
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not saying, and please, I'm not saying.

98
00:13:23,558 --> 00:13:25,979
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I know you're not offering an opinion actually on that.

99
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:45,708
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess, one of the other challenges with the variable date observances and we have, is that some of these dates in some years will land when we don't have school.

100
00:13:48,269 --> 00:13:50,130
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's one of those things where,

101
00:13:51,438 --> 00:14:03,806
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't want a policy that some years works and some years doesn't work, obviously, because then the superintendent's gonna have to come to us in November and say, I followed the policy, we have to go to school until July 1st.

102
00:14:05,687 --> 00:14:10,590
[SPEAKER_11]: Or worst case, July 3rd, if Monday is, if the first were a Saturday, for instance.

103
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:15,212
[SPEAKER_13]: You do not under state law go into fiscal year.

104
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:16,833
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, yeah, no, I know.

105
00:14:16,913 --> 00:14:21,136
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, if the superintendent followed the policy, played it all out,

106
00:14:21,678 --> 00:14:26,740
[SPEAKER_11]: and was like, we don't have a calendar that can be approved because of that.

107
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:34,742
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want the policy to be functional most years, but on occasion, not functional.

108
00:14:34,883 --> 00:14:36,083
[SPEAKER_11]: That's sort of my point.

109
00:14:37,944 --> 00:14:41,005
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, Juneteenth this year, for instance, is on a Saturday.

110
00:14:41,825 --> 00:14:46,787
[SPEAKER_11]: And we got lucky because Juneteenth was added after our last calendar was approved.

111
00:14:47,867 --> 00:14:50,868
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's the no school day if it had been

112
00:14:53,308 --> 00:15:04,293
[SPEAKER_11]: Any of the six other days of the week, we would have had to use a snow day, essentially, because we would have had to take it off, but the last calendar did not consider it.

113
00:15:06,974 --> 00:15:22,762
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so two days right now is the maximum is what I'm hearing we can fit, unless we are going to address the bigger issue of February vacation, which I don't think we can cover tonight, because it's not on the agenda, but also because

114
00:15:23,376 --> 00:15:29,381
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a multi-community effort is how I understand other communities have addressed the February vacation problem.

115
00:15:30,622 --> 00:15:39,068
[SPEAKER_02]: And remember, so I would like to hear if there's anyone who has joined us who has thoughts about these particular holidays.

116
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:42,331
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely, thank you.

117
00:15:44,342 --> 00:15:44,482
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

118
00:15:44,522 --> 00:15:50,348
[SPEAKER_11]: Weiss, if you could just notate that Member McLaughlin has joined us and I see a hand up.

119
00:15:50,929 --> 00:15:56,054
[SPEAKER_11]: Michael, could you state your name and address or just your Medford Street address for the record, please?

120
00:15:59,018 --> 00:15:59,218
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

121
00:16:02,281 --> 00:16:05,945
[SPEAKER_11]: Oops, I might've muted you or unmuted you.

122
00:16:12,428 --> 00:16:15,269
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, Michael Bernstein, Lyman Avenue, Medford.

123
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,631
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to speak.

124
00:16:18,331 --> 00:16:28,216
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to just clarify, while June 19th is on a weekend this coming school year, it's being observed as a closed school day, as a no school day on the 20th.

125
00:16:29,797 --> 00:16:36,980
[SPEAKER_00]: So that did actually affect the calendar for next year, unless there's some other reason why June 20th is designated as a no school day.

126
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,681
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, Michael.

127
00:16:41,311 --> 00:16:53,737
[SPEAKER_11]: the 2021 calendar year, the 19th is on a Saturday and the state law for state holidays is that Saturday holidays just are Saturday holidays.

128
00:16:53,937 --> 00:17:02,100
[SPEAKER_11]: Sunday holidays roll on to being a Monday holiday and then there's a couple of exceptions like Christmas and I don't know what else it was.

129
00:17:02,941 --> 00:17:03,461
[SPEAKER_11]: Next year,

130
00:17:04,598 --> 00:17:05,940
[SPEAKER_11]: is I think what you're talking about.

131
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,262
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, next year is what I was talking about.

132
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:21,056
[SPEAKER_00]: I also wanted to point out that of the three holidays that you're considering adding, one of them is currently for the coming year would be in July and would not be a school day.

133
00:17:21,776 --> 00:17:27,002
[SPEAKER_00]: And that some of the other dates that are also moving dates such as Rosh Hashanah, the first day,

134
00:17:27,401 --> 00:17:35,567
[SPEAKER_00]: and Yom Kippur that have been newly designated as no school days will sometimes be on weekends, as will some of these other dates that you're considering adding.

135
00:17:36,948 --> 00:17:53,641
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that worrying about the very rare case where every one of those dates would be a school date and you would therefore run into the end of the year, I suspect we're gonna run into years like Snowmageddon more often than that, where that starts to affect the calendar.

136
00:17:55,010 --> 00:18:09,442
[SPEAKER_00]: And it feels like that could be dealt with, especially if you're approving the calendar typically in November of the year before, that that would be recognized well in advance to be able to start to adjust how you're going to handle professional development days and adjust the calendar as needed then.

137
00:18:11,408 --> 00:18:21,852
[SPEAKER_00]: While I've got the mic for a second, I just wanted to voice my support for adding these holidays as no school days based on my understanding that these are important communities that celebrate these holidays.

138
00:18:22,492 --> 00:18:29,215
[SPEAKER_00]: While they're not my holidays, two of the holidays that were recently added to the no school list are my holidays.

139
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:35,437
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fact that those were added was incredibly meaningful and important to my family as recognition of the diversity in the community.

140
00:18:35,457 --> 00:18:37,438
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you very much.

141
00:18:38,762 --> 00:18:39,482
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

142
00:18:39,542 --> 00:18:49,944
[SPEAKER_11]: And I appreciate also the sort of threading that needle of, you know, I have not sat down and tried to play out, which it would not be hard to do.

143
00:18:50,344 --> 00:18:58,366
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it would be tedious, but it would not be hard to like play out the next 10 years of these and find out, do we really run into a problem or not?

144
00:18:58,966 --> 00:19:05,087
[SPEAKER_11]: And actually thinking about that and the way you talked about how, you know, there'll be things that end up in July,

145
00:19:05,637 --> 00:19:34,621
[SPEAKER_11]: or things that are, you know, something could end up in February vacation or some other already declared non-school time, that maybe we just simply add something to the policy to say, you know, in the event that the policy creates a, the policy as written cannot create enough school days to meet state compliance, that the school committee will be

146
00:19:35,187 --> 00:19:36,948
[SPEAKER_11]: uh, consulted on how to proceed.

147
00:19:37,769 --> 00:19:43,713
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, you know, I don't really look forward to trying to figure out, well, whose holiday do we cut this year?

148
00:19:43,733 --> 00:19:58,443
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, but, um, I, you know, I know that I certainly played out a number of these when we were writing the policy and it was interesting to see, you know, cause I, I observed no holidays that are lunar holidays.

149
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:02,166
[SPEAKER_11]: So it was just so fascinating to see how well they move.

150
00:20:02,898 --> 00:20:05,339
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, everybody who follows those kinds of holidays know this.

151
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,221
[SPEAKER_11]: But anybody else want to have something to say on this?

152
00:20:12,963 --> 00:20:14,503
[SPEAKER_11]: Barbara Graham, I see you muted.

153
00:20:15,124 --> 00:20:19,746
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so I was actually trying to look at the calendar as we were talking.

154
00:20:20,066 --> 00:20:23,307
[SPEAKER_02]: And for example, for the 2022-2023 school year, these holidays all occur in 2023.

155
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:25,128
[SPEAKER_02]: The Lunar New Year is on a Sunday.

156
00:20:34,518 --> 00:20:37,939
[SPEAKER_02]: one of the holidays is I believe on 4-21.

157
00:20:38,339 --> 00:20:46,642
[SPEAKER_02]: But I, hold on a second, did I do that wrong?

158
00:20:47,223 --> 00:20:56,726
[SPEAKER_02]: On 4-21, which if I am like eyeballing that correctly would fall within April vacation often.

159
00:20:56,746 --> 00:20:58,306
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's right around that timeline.

160
00:20:58,346 --> 00:20:59,447
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the final one is on

161
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,703
[SPEAKER_02]: Wednesday, June 28th, which could actually sort of be outside.

162
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:23,176
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think, you know, one thing we could consider is adding these holidays and, you know, amending the policy to say that, you know, when the superintendent presents the calendar in November of every year, we need to look with, you know,

163
00:21:26,313 --> 00:21:35,320
[SPEAKER_02]: know, we need to look at the impact of the full schedule and determine whether we have a contention issue with snow days.

164
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:41,464
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the other sort of thing that I'm thinking about is wanting to understand

165
00:21:45,883 --> 00:22:02,182
[SPEAKER_02]: know if there are other districts out there that are using holidays like this in a flexible manner for staff where we might be able to provide time for students in a unilateral way but provide

166
00:22:03,842 --> 00:22:20,288
[SPEAKER_02]: flexible professional development for staff with the thought that like the same staff member is likely not going to observe Good Friday and Yom Kippur, for example, or Good Friday and Rosh Hashanah, you know what I mean?

167
00:22:20,328 --> 00:22:28,931
[SPEAKER_02]: So there might be, you know, there just might be some other creative options, which I don't think we can necessarily like get to the bottom of in this meeting.

168
00:22:29,012 --> 00:22:30,252
[SPEAKER_02]: And they obviously have like

169
00:22:31,157 --> 00:22:54,187
[SPEAKER_02]: impacts across our ecosystem, but maybe there are other creative ways to think about some of that stuff if we can get some feedback from the group that's here and perhaps from our colleagues on Monday night around the directional way we might go and

170
00:22:56,798 --> 00:23:06,628
[SPEAKER_02]: present some questions to the administration to sort of come back to us with in September, because again, we're not enacting this, this set of changes would not take effect for an entire year.

171
00:23:06,768 --> 00:23:17,939
[SPEAKER_02]: So we could, you know, talk about draft changes and what the challenges are, what the opportunities are with those changes.

172
00:23:19,792 --> 00:23:31,417
[SPEAKER_02]: in terms of recognizing holidays that are really important to members of our community and then pose a series of questions to the administration for a little bit of like digging and research on their end around some other options.

173
00:23:31,457 --> 00:23:34,858
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something that I've been thinking about as we've been talking about this.

174
00:23:36,779 --> 00:23:42,881
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just, I think the other thing that's like really top of mind for me at the moment is

175
00:23:44,105 --> 00:23:49,470
[SPEAKER_02]: just how hot it's been in this last week, and that's not going to be getting better.

176
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:56,016
[SPEAKER_02]: So as we are adding holidays, we are making decisions to extend the school year.

177
00:23:56,036 --> 00:24:01,822
[SPEAKER_02]: And in an extreme weather year, we could be right up to the end of June 30th.

178
00:24:03,423 --> 00:24:07,967
[SPEAKER_02]: And so maybe that is worthy of discussion in its own right to say,

179
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:23,760
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't talk about or revisit any of the things that we have always done, and maybe we could or we should as a part of this discussion in a larger way at the beginning of the next school year.

180
00:24:27,663 --> 00:24:28,103
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

181
00:24:28,123 --> 00:24:35,849
[SPEAKER_11]: Horia Jalabi, could you just state your name and address for the record, just your street address for the record, please?

182
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:44,394
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, my name is Haria Chalabi, and my address is 57 Washington Street, Apartment 9, Medford.

183
00:24:44,434 --> 00:24:46,314
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for allowing me to speak.

184
00:24:47,355 --> 00:24:56,339
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm going to talk about our holidays, Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha, just to give you an idea how it goes with our holidays.

185
00:24:56,399 --> 00:25:00,321
[SPEAKER_09]: So we follow lunar year, and every year,

186
00:25:02,529 --> 00:25:03,810
[SPEAKER_09]: is going to be a different day.

187
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:10,817
[SPEAKER_09]: So like this year, Eid al-Adha was on May 13.

188
00:25:11,518 --> 00:25:16,162
[SPEAKER_09]: So next year is going to be like 10 days ahead of that day.

189
00:25:17,623 --> 00:25:26,392
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, and for another district that they are using, they have also been

190
00:25:28,908 --> 00:25:31,670
[SPEAKER_09]: No days on these holidays is Cambridge.

191
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:41,397
[SPEAKER_09]: They have been having, they have a calendar where many, there is many holidays that are no school.

192
00:25:41,717 --> 00:25:45,640
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think they start their school year on September 1st.

193
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:48,762
[SPEAKER_09]: And the last day of school is June 23rd.

194
00:25:50,163 --> 00:25:56,467
[SPEAKER_09]: So they are, I think they are the only district they have these holidays on their calendar.

195
00:25:58,764 --> 00:26:04,246
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know I think Boston are working on also having them on the calendar right now.

196
00:26:04,386 --> 00:26:06,427
[SPEAKER_09]: And I hope Metro too.

197
00:26:10,229 --> 00:26:11,229
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Maria.

198
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:11,950
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Maria.

199
00:26:17,592 --> 00:26:25,116
[SPEAKER_10]: One second.

200
00:26:25,956 --> 00:26:28,217
[SPEAKER_11]: Can't see the whole name because of Zoom.

201
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:32,472
[SPEAKER_11]: But Humayun, I'm gonna unmute you if you'd like to speak.

202
00:26:32,512 --> 00:26:35,013
[SPEAKER_11]: If you could say your name and street address.

203
00:26:37,194 --> 00:26:37,455
[SPEAKER_12]: Hello?

204
00:26:38,215 --> 00:26:38,495
[SPEAKER_12]: Hello.

205
00:26:38,515 --> 00:26:42,217
[SPEAKER_12]: Nope, we made a joke.

206
00:26:42,237 --> 00:26:43,358
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's try that again.

207
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,821
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, I think we should be able to hear you now.

208
00:26:49,861 --> 00:26:50,101
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello?

209
00:26:50,401 --> 00:26:51,242
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, hi, can you hear me?

210
00:26:51,782 --> 00:26:51,982
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

211
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:55,724
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, hi, my name is Humayun Moshe.

212
00:26:57,084 --> 00:26:58,766
[SPEAKER_08]: My address is 30 St.

213
00:26:58,806 --> 00:26:59,987
[SPEAKER_08]: Francis Street, Medford.

214
00:27:00,607 --> 00:27:06,371
[SPEAKER_08]: And also, I represent the Islamic Cultural Center of Medford.

215
00:27:06,471 --> 00:27:08,253
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm the president of the organization as well.

216
00:27:09,033 --> 00:27:14,217
[SPEAKER_08]: So, on behalf of the Muslim community, I'd like to say thank you for considering our holidays.

217
00:27:14,837 --> 00:27:20,602
[SPEAKER_08]: But also, we're not going to compromise the mandatory school days.

218
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:23,171
[SPEAKER_08]: We like to be flexible.

219
00:27:23,351 --> 00:27:27,934
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not, I mean, we're not going to cut any school days.

220
00:27:27,974 --> 00:27:31,677
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the priority number one, but we could be flexible also.

221
00:27:32,097 --> 00:27:44,226
[SPEAKER_08]: So I understand, I agree, whatever the discussions in future day change, we could be, you know, we get advance notice to the school committee or the city.

222
00:27:44,606 --> 00:27:46,468
[SPEAKER_08]: So that way we can arrange the

223
00:27:47,468 --> 00:27:56,594
[SPEAKER_08]: and we'll be flexible, but we're not saying we have to do it, but if you guys consider, that'll be really appreciated on behalf of the community.

224
00:27:56,834 --> 00:27:58,416
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, that's all I wanna mention.

225
00:27:59,296 --> 00:28:02,058
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Humayun.

226
00:28:03,859 --> 00:28:06,161
[SPEAKER_11]: Melanie's got a thumbs up, but I don't know if she wants to speak.

227
00:28:07,742 --> 00:28:10,344
[SPEAKER_11]: Zoom sometimes is funky that way.

228
00:28:12,085 --> 00:28:13,446
[SPEAKER_11]: Member McLaughlin, did you wanna speak?

229
00:28:13,646 --> 00:28:15,187
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me unmute you, I don't know if you're a host.

230
00:28:16,931 --> 00:28:20,836
[SPEAKER_04]: No, member Rousseau, I'm actually not able to thank you.

231
00:28:21,436 --> 00:28:23,038
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

232
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:35,191
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to say thank you to Horia as well for pointing us to Cambridge Public Schools because they might be a useful model for us to talk to as well about how they

233
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:39,102
[SPEAKER_02]: are managing all of this inside of their calendar.

234
00:28:39,162 --> 00:28:47,967
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you for pointing us in the right direction instead of having us sort of have to cast a wide net of our school committee colleagues across the state.

235
00:28:48,067 --> 00:28:49,808
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can check in with them for sure.

236
00:28:51,209 --> 00:28:51,950
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, thank you.

237
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:53,311
[SPEAKER_11]: I do appreciate that.

238
00:28:55,572 --> 00:29:05,238
[SPEAKER_11]: I've talked about the February vacation a couple of times about how teachers just get back from the winter break

239
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:11,435
[SPEAKER_11]: slash Christmas break, and then they start going, and then boom, everybody's out for another week.

240
00:29:12,677 --> 00:29:15,579
[SPEAKER_11]: My understanding is teachers do not like February vacation.

241
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:29,052
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm sure that saying that implies all teachers think the same thing, which is not exactly very useful, but that it's not an uncommon opinion from teachers that February vacation is just,

242
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:35,182
[SPEAKER_11]: not good for academics and for continued work.

243
00:29:36,162 --> 00:29:44,366
[SPEAKER_11]: But in my conversations, I think with Dr. Cushing, or maybe it was Dr. Murphy, Mr. Murphy, I forget all the right doctors.

244
00:29:47,127 --> 00:29:52,990
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a problem that is best resolved sort of regionally.

245
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:58,753
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't want to require our teachers to come to school in February when

246
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:05,994
[SPEAKER_11]: All of those with children are in districts where they are home.

247
00:30:07,175 --> 00:30:12,099
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, we just want to try not to create a childcare crisis every single February.

248
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,882
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, another community could do it to us too.

249
00:30:15,042 --> 00:30:19,766
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I think it makes sense to broach that conversation.

250
00:30:21,429 --> 00:30:34,458
[SPEAKER_11]: in another setting or the superintendent, of course, has, you know, regional contacts with all of the districts around us, you know, around calling snow days and all this other stuff.

251
00:30:34,518 --> 00:30:48,587
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just want everybody to know that is something that we have talked about, but it's actually much more complicated than, certainly than I had considered, you know, living and working in the same town.

252
00:30:51,238 --> 00:30:53,200
[SPEAKER_11]: Maria, would you like to speak again?

253
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:57,203
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi.

254
00:30:57,363 --> 00:30:57,623
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

255
00:30:58,083 --> 00:31:00,545
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think it's doable.

256
00:31:00,785 --> 00:31:04,028
[SPEAKER_09]: We can add holidays, at least to one of them.

257
00:31:04,048 --> 00:31:07,951
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I'm talking about our holidays.

258
00:31:07,971 --> 00:31:10,172
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not familiar with other holidays.

259
00:31:10,853 --> 00:31:15,296
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, the thing is, like this year, I can't tell you how it went this year.

260
00:31:17,151 --> 00:31:26,253
[SPEAKER_09]: So this year, MCAS was, I know it was a mess this year and everybody was doing their best, but it's good to hear from our perspective.

261
00:31:27,313 --> 00:31:35,635
[SPEAKER_09]: So this year, they were MCAS scheduled on May 13th, on the day of our holiday.

262
00:31:35,835 --> 00:31:39,996
[SPEAKER_09]: I know some families, they don't know that they can opt out their kids.

263
00:31:40,506 --> 00:31:57,621
[SPEAKER_09]: And they, you know, there's this anxiety that, oh no, I'm not gonna let this, my kid to miss test or, and, you know, I know some families, you know, they still attend classes on that day, even though they have the right to take absence that day.

264
00:31:58,241 --> 00:32:04,387
[SPEAKER_09]: And they, some may not, they have like language barrier, some may don't, they are not,

265
00:32:06,598 --> 00:32:08,279
[SPEAKER_09]: familiar with the school system.

266
00:32:08,599 --> 00:32:15,541
[SPEAKER_09]: I have been in the United States for a long time, but still, every time I'm learning things with my oldest son.

267
00:32:15,901 --> 00:32:36,388
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm sure other families that they have kids from my community, they are not familiar with some school systems rules and what they can, if they can, like MCAS, they can opt out or they

268
00:32:36,927 --> 00:32:38,708
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, they can make it another day.

269
00:32:39,209 --> 00:32:51,197
[SPEAKER_09]: So, since we're talking about holidays, not only if we can add it's no school day, it make it easy for families to just focus on this holiday.

270
00:32:51,357 --> 00:33:06,328
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, like me, like personally, even though I sent an email to some teachers and some like, you know, the school, I still had one of the teachers sent my son notification that you're not at school.

271
00:33:06,946 --> 00:33:09,408
[SPEAKER_09]: and you, you haven't done your work.

272
00:33:10,049 --> 00:33:14,032
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, I had to, you know, my son, my son didn't know what to do.

273
00:33:14,052 --> 00:33:17,595
[SPEAKER_09]: So I had to, you know, email them back and say, it's our holiday.

274
00:33:17,755 --> 00:33:27,183
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know, he's not, he's not at school and he's not supposed to have to worry about any project or homework today.

275
00:33:27,203 --> 00:33:27,243
[SPEAKER_09]: So,

276
00:33:29,009 --> 00:33:41,918
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, we still have, you know, we still, even though there is absence, excuse absence, but there is homework, there are projects, especially if they are in middle school and up, they still have to do some work on that day.

277
00:33:42,098 --> 00:33:52,766
[SPEAKER_09]: Some work are due the other day, some work, you know, so it's still challenging and, you know, for our, like our communities and parents.

278
00:33:55,928 --> 00:33:59,549
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's the thing that I wanted to share with you.

279
00:34:00,589 --> 00:34:01,649
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

280
00:34:02,289 --> 00:34:06,870
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I mean, I will just say that this new policy is new this year.

281
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:18,632
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think I know that I have heard from, I think two principals separately, how much they appreciated this, that it was all written down as in one place.

282
00:34:20,073 --> 00:34:21,653
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, there's no,

283
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:34,069
[SPEAKER_11]: expectation that all the teachers are out there trying to figure out, you know, I mean, I have my calendar and my computer and sometimes I'm like, I thought today was a holiday.

284
00:34:34,109 --> 00:34:42,375
[SPEAKER_11]: And then other times, you know, I just looked at Juneteenth and it says at the top Juneteenth five times, like, I don't know why there's five Juneteenths in my calendar.

285
00:34:42,795 --> 00:34:51,762
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, to expect all of the teachers to just figure it all out every year has sort of kind of, has been sort of the past practice.

286
00:34:52,152 --> 00:34:55,193
[SPEAKER_11]: Now there's one document that says it all and explains it all.

287
00:34:55,653 --> 00:35:03,836
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know that the superintendent was very thankful when we passed that policy because I won't say it makes things easier, it makes things clear.

288
00:35:04,796 --> 00:35:10,258
[SPEAKER_11]: And that I think is really critical.

289
00:35:10,718 --> 00:35:11,759
[SPEAKER_11]: Does anybody else have any?

290
00:35:12,659 --> 00:35:13,219
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Paul.

291
00:35:13,279 --> 00:35:14,840
[SPEAKER_09]: I really appreciate this.

292
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,401
[SPEAKER_09]: I know it has been hard and it's good

293
00:35:19,228 --> 00:35:22,849
[SPEAKER_09]: I really appreciate communication between parents and school.

294
00:35:23,129 --> 00:35:29,330
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's how we can make a better school environment for kids.

295
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:38,313
[SPEAKER_09]: And we all working together to improve school for our kids.

296
00:35:39,833 --> 00:35:46,455
[SPEAKER_02]: And Horia, I think one of the things that is definitely true starting next year is that

297
00:35:49,012 --> 00:35:52,414
[SPEAKER_02]: there will be no testing allowed on your holidays.

298
00:35:53,054 --> 00:36:12,563
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully this year being the mess that it has been for lots of reasons, was an anomaly and that at minimum next year, we will have clear guidance about tests and projects and homework in place while we figure out how to, you know,

299
00:36:13,404 --> 00:36:23,312
[SPEAKER_02]: be equally respectful of all of the religious holidays that the folks in Medford celebrate, you know, whoever they might be.

300
00:36:23,452 --> 00:36:37,804
[SPEAKER_02]: So even if this is sort of tricky and complicated and maybe gonna take some time, I feel better that we have put some things in place to make some significant

301
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:46,553
[SPEAKER_02]: clarifying moves for next year, but even though we may just need to keep working at this for a bit.

302
00:36:47,554 --> 00:36:59,799
[SPEAKER_02]: So I hope that there's a way for us as we go into next year and the superintendent continues her communications that when the holidays come up,

303
00:37:01,183 --> 00:37:26,293
[SPEAKER_02]: that are sort of in this block mode where there is school, but there are restrictions on what can happen in school that we can find a good proactive way to reach families in their native language so that they know what is expected or not expected and what choices and options they have, as you point out.

304
00:37:26,393 --> 00:37:28,414
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that will be really important next year.

305
00:37:30,282 --> 00:37:30,882
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be great.

306
00:37:30,902 --> 00:37:31,882
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much.

307
00:37:32,542 --> 00:37:33,163
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

308
00:37:36,483 --> 00:37:38,764
[SPEAKER_12]: Was anybody else like to speak on this?

309
00:37:41,584 --> 00:37:45,365
[SPEAKER_11]: I, in the meeting, I wrote a, is it one sentence?

310
00:37:45,565 --> 00:37:48,685
[SPEAKER_11]: One sentence as a potential amendment to the policy.

311
00:37:49,726 --> 00:37:51,346
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Graham, I presume you can see it.

312
00:37:51,426 --> 00:37:57,747
[SPEAKER_11]: I will read it for Member McLaughlin because I believe she may not be able to see the Zoom right now, but I added to the

313
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:16,143
[SPEAKER_11]: our school year calendar policy, a sentence under the policy section says, in the event that this policy creates a situation where we will have an insufficient number of school days, the superintendent will bring this to the school committee for advice on how to proceed to ensure the minimum 180 school days.

314
00:38:17,304 --> 00:38:19,946
[SPEAKER_11]: It feels a little clunky, that sentence at the end.

315
00:38:19,966 --> 00:38:24,329
[SPEAKER_11]: What do you think, Memorandum?

316
00:38:24,689 --> 00:38:25,990
[SPEAKER_11]: Any thoughts that sound good?

317
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,301
[SPEAKER_11]: It's clear, right?

318
00:38:27,321 --> 00:38:28,842
[SPEAKER_04]: I make the motion to approve.

319
00:38:28,862 --> 00:38:41,252
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the only thing we need to add is the minimum of 180 school days and 185 scheduled days, just so it's clear that we have to schedule 185 days.

320
00:38:42,953 --> 00:38:48,238
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, I think that's a good point, because I did start the meeting earlier by saying there's nothing in here about snow days.

321
00:38:49,238 --> 00:38:53,122
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm sure the minimum 180 school days

322
00:38:55,573 --> 00:39:15,589
[SPEAKER_11]: and 185 scheduled school days per the, I'm gonna bet it's in CMR 27, but per the state requirement to include five.

323
00:39:18,591 --> 00:39:22,434
[SPEAKER_11]: Are they called inclement weather days or snow days, Dr. Edwards-Vincent, do you know?

324
00:39:25,557 --> 00:39:34,741
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you can list it as inclement weather, because it could be, you know, a bad event, you know, a tornado or something.

325
00:39:35,261 --> 00:39:36,021
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yes.

326
00:39:36,922 --> 00:39:38,582
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, thank you.

327
00:39:39,883 --> 00:39:41,483
[SPEAKER_11]: So I added that little bit.

328
00:39:41,563 --> 00:39:43,244
[SPEAKER_11]: Member McLaughlin, did you want to motion?

329
00:39:43,404 --> 00:39:45,205
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, Mr. Kane wants to speak.

330
00:39:45,645 --> 00:39:46,665
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me unmute you.

331
00:39:48,186 --> 00:39:49,206
[SPEAKER_11]: Nick, hello.

332
00:39:50,027 --> 00:39:50,367
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello.

333
00:39:50,627 --> 00:39:53,128
[SPEAKER_11]: Name and street address for the record, please.

334
00:39:53,738 --> 00:39:54,599
[SPEAKER_01]: My name's Nick Kane.

335
00:39:54,619 --> 00:39:56,261
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually a teacher at the high school.

336
00:39:57,482 --> 00:40:01,305
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was just attending out of an interest in the conversation.

337
00:40:02,506 --> 00:40:11,074
[SPEAKER_01]: And I heard you mentioned earlier, if we could look forward in the upcoming years when these, when holidays that move would both fall in a weekday.

338
00:40:11,455 --> 00:40:18,361
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I just did a little quick research and I might be off on some of these, but it looks like in the next three years,

339
00:40:20,102 --> 00:40:28,285
[SPEAKER_01]: between the 22, 23 school year and 24, 25, the Lunar New Year and Abe would not both fall on a school day.

340
00:40:29,745 --> 00:40:39,828
[SPEAKER_01]: And same for, it's actually for five of the next six years that it looks as though they would be split between a weekend day and a regular day, just for planning purposes going forward.

341
00:40:40,708 --> 00:40:42,049
[SPEAKER_11]: Great, thank you, I appreciate it.

342
00:40:42,069 --> 00:40:45,950
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, one of the challenges is you have to kind of schedule all of the days

343
00:40:46,602 --> 00:40:48,604
[SPEAKER_11]: for a year, and then you can do the math.

344
00:40:48,904 --> 00:40:53,608
[SPEAKER_11]: And I suppose if I had done a little more due diligence, I might have actually done that, and I apologize.

345
00:40:54,849 --> 00:41:00,213
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess I didn't really understand that we could not pull back any of our inclement weather days.

346
00:41:00,253 --> 00:41:03,095
[SPEAKER_11]: That was sort of my out.

347
00:41:03,535 --> 00:41:05,397
[SPEAKER_11]: But that appears to not be an option.

348
00:41:05,557 --> 00:41:07,779
[SPEAKER_11]: So member McLaughlin, are you- Motion to approve.

349
00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:08,719
Thank you.

350
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:10,841
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you hear me, Paul?

351
00:41:10,881 --> 00:41:11,782
[SPEAKER_03]: I said motion to approve.

352
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:12,262
[SPEAKER_03]: I can, yes.

353
00:41:12,603 --> 00:41:13,143
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, thank you.

354
00:41:13,183 --> 00:41:13,483
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, second.

355
00:41:13,503 --> 00:41:15,525
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

356
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:19,052
[SPEAKER_11]: I will take the roll call on that.

357
00:41:20,013 --> 00:41:22,255
[SPEAKER_11]: And that is just the amendment to the policy, by the way.

358
00:41:22,655 --> 00:41:23,956
[SPEAKER_11]: So that member Graham.

359
00:41:25,037 --> 00:41:25,277
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

360
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:27,018
[SPEAKER_11]: Member McLaughlin.

361
00:41:27,819 --> 00:41:28,119
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

362
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,781
[SPEAKER_11]: So yes, three in the affirmative.

363
00:41:31,242 --> 00:41:38,868
[SPEAKER_11]: The amendment to the policy regarding the situation where there are insufficient number of days using the policy.

364
00:41:39,708 --> 00:41:45,533
[SPEAKER_11]: So now I think we should vote on whether or not we wish to

365
00:41:46,703 --> 00:41:48,204
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion to approve.

366
00:41:50,145 --> 00:41:50,685
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Graham.

367
00:41:53,086 --> 00:41:56,447
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Russo, we also have Mr. Kane again, but we do have a motion on the floor.

368
00:41:57,208 --> 00:41:58,408
[SPEAKER_11]: I think his hand just didn't come down.

369
00:41:58,428 --> 00:42:07,152
[SPEAKER_11]: And so the motion, right, is to add these three as no school days beginning in 2022, 2023.

370
00:42:08,073 --> 00:42:11,434
[SPEAKER_11]: And for anybody watching, this is just the subcommittee recommendation.

371
00:42:11,714 --> 00:42:15,676
[SPEAKER_11]: The full committee will surely have an opinion and conversation on that.

372
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:17,211
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there a second?

373
00:42:18,752 --> 00:42:19,112
[SPEAKER_02]: Second.

374
00:42:19,993 --> 00:42:20,794
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

375
00:42:21,794 --> 00:42:22,615
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Graham?

376
00:42:23,576 --> 00:42:23,836
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

377
00:42:24,797 --> 00:42:25,658
[SPEAKER_11]: Member McLaughlin?

378
00:42:26,559 --> 00:42:26,879
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

379
00:42:27,499 --> 00:42:29,501
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Russo, yes, three in the affirmative.

380
00:42:30,502 --> 00:42:43,053
[SPEAKER_11]: So the two updates to this policy will be sent to the full school committee on Monday, the 14th, which is five minutes, it feels like.

381
00:42:44,044 --> 00:42:46,125
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, everyone, for joining on that topic.

382
00:42:46,225 --> 00:42:47,066
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion to adjourn?

383
00:42:47,206 --> 00:42:47,626
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, sorry.

384
00:42:48,106 --> 00:42:48,727
[SPEAKER_11]: Nope, we have two more.

385
00:42:48,747 --> 00:42:50,087
[SPEAKER_11]: I know you can't see the agenda.

386
00:42:50,508 --> 00:42:52,008
[SPEAKER_04]: I can, I'm sorry, Mr. Mayor.

387
00:42:52,028 --> 00:42:53,769
[SPEAKER_11]: That's all right.

388
00:42:53,809 --> 00:42:58,432
[SPEAKER_11]: So the second item on the agenda is policy BEDH, our public participation policy.

389
00:42:58,472 --> 00:42:59,492
[SPEAKER_11]: We did discuss this.

390
00:42:59,512 --> 00:43:02,934
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me close this out for now.

391
00:43:03,855 --> 00:43:05,155
[SPEAKER_11]: So I guess I'll stay on that.

392
00:43:06,116 --> 00:43:09,998
[SPEAKER_11]: So last meeting we held, we discussed

393
00:43:11,230 --> 00:43:15,934
[SPEAKER_11]: a substantial number of, frankly, an entirely new policy on public participation.

394
00:43:16,975 --> 00:43:21,600
[SPEAKER_11]: The policy, the major changes, okay, it's all new, so it's all major changes.

395
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:33,470
[SPEAKER_11]: I should just not try to say it was just a little change, is to, first of all, make it crystal clear that there are two kinds of public participation at school committee meetings.

396
00:43:34,571 --> 00:43:36,974
[SPEAKER_11]: The language in our current policy is

397
00:43:37,825 --> 00:43:39,186
[SPEAKER_11]: like three sentences long.

398
00:43:39,786 --> 00:43:45,729
[SPEAKER_11]: And it is clear from well, it was clear on Monday at our meeting.

399
00:43:46,610 --> 00:43:58,196
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's been clear before as well that the public and frankly, the committee members, some of us at least have found it confusing to talk about public participation because there are two kinds.

400
00:43:58,216 --> 00:43:58,917
[SPEAKER_11]: So

401
00:44:00,247 --> 00:44:08,711
[SPEAKER_11]: The new policy starts off with just a simple reference to what part of the Massachusetts general laws actually govern public participation.

402
00:44:09,771 --> 00:44:10,391
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's there.

403
00:44:10,511 --> 00:44:17,454
[SPEAKER_11]: So anybody reading the policy can link right to it and know what the law says, which I think is important.

404
00:44:19,395 --> 00:44:22,856
[SPEAKER_11]: The public comment section.

405
00:44:23,096 --> 00:44:27,098
[SPEAKER_11]: So what we have decided in this policy, if we approve it,

406
00:44:27,691 --> 00:44:33,213
[SPEAKER_11]: is to call the public comment section and a community participation section.

407
00:44:33,253 --> 00:44:38,495
[SPEAKER_11]: We're just trying not to use participation or public or community in both of them.

408
00:44:39,815 --> 00:44:49,298
[SPEAKER_11]: So public comment is when a member of the public wants to speak on an item that is on the agenda that we're discussing.

409
00:44:52,179 --> 00:44:53,600
[SPEAKER_11]: Procedurally, it's not new.

410
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:55,621
[SPEAKER_11]: This has been what we've done.

411
00:44:57,325 --> 00:45:05,475
[SPEAKER_11]: And so this is just a long winded version of explaining how that will function.

412
00:45:06,196 --> 00:45:16,688
[SPEAKER_11]: This new policy does presume that the state will allow remote participation via zoom so we could pass this whole thing, the state could decide

413
00:45:17,626 --> 00:45:18,887
[SPEAKER_11]: No, we're not gonna extend it.

414
00:45:19,227 --> 00:45:22,148
[SPEAKER_11]: Zoom goes away, which I really hope they don't do.

415
00:45:23,289 --> 00:45:25,750
[SPEAKER_11]: If they do, we'll have to revisit this policy in the fall.

416
00:45:26,970 --> 00:45:29,651
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, so- Can I make a point of information, member Russo?

417
00:45:30,152 --> 00:45:30,352
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

418
00:45:31,532 --> 00:45:44,138
[SPEAKER_04]: What is the difference or how are we differentiating for the community those things that have been pre-requested the week prior for public comment and those that are

419
00:45:45,135 --> 00:45:49,959
[SPEAKER_04]: individuals who want to talk on a topic or who have something that they want to bring that night?

420
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:51,280
[SPEAKER_03]: How are we differentiating that?

421
00:45:52,241 --> 00:45:52,481
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure.

422
00:45:52,641 --> 00:45:57,885
[SPEAKER_11]: So when somebody wants to speak on an item on the agenda, we're calling that public comment.

423
00:45:58,366 --> 00:46:04,370
[SPEAKER_11]: The whole committee is going to have to work to redo our language to make sure it's clear.

424
00:46:04,851 --> 00:46:13,978
[SPEAKER_11]: When somebody in the public wants to do a presentation, like our dyslexia presentation we had a few meetings back, that's community participation.

425
00:46:15,338 --> 00:46:24,103
[SPEAKER_11]: And that is, I can, actually, I believe you were in this meeting before, so you did see the language.

426
00:46:24,123 --> 00:46:25,144
[SPEAKER_11]: That isn't changing.

427
00:46:25,764 --> 00:46:27,406
[SPEAKER_11]: We're revisiting it for a different reason.

428
00:46:28,046 --> 00:46:29,027
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Graham, I see your hand up.

429
00:46:29,527 --> 00:46:37,592
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was just thinking that it might actually be helpful to call that a third thing, which is,

430
00:46:39,188 --> 00:46:55,823
[SPEAKER_02]: like presentation from the public so that when we're talking on the agenda, when we're talking about presentation from the public, we are only covering that if there is a presentation that has followed this procedure, it has gone to the superintendent and is noted on the agenda.

431
00:46:55,923 --> 00:47:00,126
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, there's nothing in that section and we're moving on and there can be no,

432
00:47:00,987 --> 00:47:17,175
[SPEAKER_02]: confusion between somebody who has scheduled time to do a presentation on dyslexia, for example, which was one of our most recent, and somebody who wants to talk about dyslexia, but is not on that section of the agenda.

433
00:47:17,235 --> 00:47:24,639
[SPEAKER_02]: So I sort of feel like that should be its own section of the agenda, just to be really clear about what it is, and more importantly, what it is not.

434
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:26,780
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, Member Russo.

435
00:47:27,321 --> 00:47:28,161
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, Member McLaughlin.

436
00:47:28,994 --> 00:47:30,415
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that was exactly the point.

437
00:47:30,435 --> 00:47:35,058
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like it to say presentation as opposed to participation.

438
00:47:35,078 --> 00:47:36,959
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that will help differentiate for folks.

439
00:47:37,419 --> 00:47:37,699
[SPEAKER_11]: Love it.

440
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:42,702
[SPEAKER_11]: So, so presentations from the public or should we just say public presentations?

441
00:47:43,563 --> 00:47:45,164
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I think it's fine just the way you have it.

442
00:47:45,184 --> 00:47:47,565
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

443
00:47:48,286 --> 00:47:48,526
[SPEAKER_11]: Great.

444
00:47:49,166 --> 00:47:49,646
[SPEAKER_11]: I like that.

445
00:47:49,666 --> 00:47:55,610
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me just look at the rest of this language to see include a community, a

446
00:48:01,135 --> 00:48:04,998
[SPEAKER_10]: just updating the... Did I spell that wrong?

447
00:48:09,201 --> 00:48:09,562
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

448
00:48:10,522 --> 00:48:13,685
[SPEAKER_11]: So, and then the rest of this is just the procedure.

449
00:48:14,105 --> 00:48:23,272
[SPEAKER_11]: And for those that weren't in the last meeting, we defined a procedure because there are scenarios for which the presentation will be rejected by the superintendent.

450
00:48:23,773 --> 00:48:27,876
[SPEAKER_11]: And I wanted to make sure that the procedure allowed, the policy allowed for,

451
00:48:29,547 --> 00:48:33,869
[SPEAKER_11]: essentially the school committee to have a vote if we disagree.

452
00:48:35,290 --> 00:48:50,056
[SPEAKER_11]: And the superintendent, I mean, I don't think the superintendent has had an opportunity to reject the presentation, but for instance, if his presentation was sent in that was around the performance of a teacher or a principal, that absolutely will be rejected by the superintendent.

453
00:48:50,537 --> 00:48:51,457
[SPEAKER_11]: It would be illegal.

454
00:48:52,818 --> 00:48:56,899
[SPEAKER_11]: And if the person who submitted it,

455
00:48:58,688 --> 00:49:09,791
[SPEAKER_11]: felt that that rejection was in fact not valid, they can submit what we call here an authority, appealing the authority determination.

456
00:49:09,931 --> 00:49:13,391
[SPEAKER_11]: So the superintendent also would reject it.

457
00:49:13,431 --> 00:49:23,294
[SPEAKER_11]: For instance, if you wanted to do a presentation on the potholes on Route 16, that is not within the authority of the school committee and we have a lot of work to do.

458
00:49:24,114 --> 00:49:27,015
[SPEAKER_11]: We're not going to let you have a presentation on the potholes on Route 16.

459
00:49:29,014 --> 00:49:43,519
[SPEAKER_11]: If it's about how we're damaging our school infrastructure, maybe, but so anyways, so we have this authority determination appeal where the school committee will make a vote to whether to sustain the determination of the superintendent.

460
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:45,600
[SPEAKER_11]: We did work all that out last time.

461
00:49:47,101 --> 00:49:56,064
[SPEAKER_11]: Now there is also after this last meeting, there were some concerns about this middle section

462
00:49:58,185 --> 00:49:58,985
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'll just read it.

463
00:49:59,205 --> 00:50:05,968
[SPEAKER_11]: It says a welcoming community is both a value of the school committee and an aspirational goal to move us towards this goal.

464
00:50:06,008 --> 00:50:06,928
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it toward or towards?

465
00:50:06,948 --> 00:50:07,968
[SPEAKER_11]: Who's the English person here?

466
00:50:07,988 --> 00:50:10,929
[SPEAKER_11]: I couldn't even get Google to help me.

467
00:50:11,710 --> 00:50:12,910
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, towards this goal.

468
00:50:13,370 --> 00:50:21,353
[SPEAKER_11]: And then the language that we approved last time, but we're going to probably change tonight because after hearing from some members of the public, I completely agree.

469
00:50:21,773 --> 00:50:27,355
[SPEAKER_11]: It said, we ask that the duration of your residency in Medford not be provided as all residents

470
00:50:27,986 --> 00:50:31,928
[SPEAKER_11]: have the same rights and responsibilities regardless of the duration of their residency.

471
00:50:32,448 --> 00:50:44,913
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, upon reflection and hearing from members across the community, frankly, as well as frankly, some of my friends who were like, oh, I do that by default.

472
00:50:44,973 --> 00:50:47,855
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I don't even know how I could ever stop myself.

473
00:50:48,915 --> 00:50:55,598
[SPEAKER_11]: It really, the point of this message is actually the second half.

474
00:50:56,784 --> 00:50:57,564
[SPEAKER_11]: of this sentence.

475
00:50:57,864 --> 00:51:02,086
[SPEAKER_11]: So less is more, less for the superintendent, the mayor to read.

476
00:51:02,586 --> 00:51:04,927
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think it's a more positive sounding sentence.

477
00:51:05,027 --> 00:51:25,275
[SPEAKER_11]: If we were to change it to move us towards this goal, we acknowledge that all residents have the same rights and responsibilities regardless of the duration of their residency in our city, which I think gets to the whole point that we were trying to get at in the last meeting that, you know, you're a resident of the city and like that's the beginning and the end

478
00:51:26,424 --> 00:51:29,645
[SPEAKER_11]: how we will value what you have to say.

479
00:51:32,706 --> 00:51:42,969
[SPEAKER_11]: What you say will have value, of course, but who you are as a member of the public speaking, that that's the point of this.

480
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:45,390
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Graham, did you seem to want to say something?

481
00:51:46,331 --> 00:51:46,671
[SPEAKER_11]: Please.

482
00:51:46,751 --> 00:51:47,311
[SPEAKER_02]: No, sorry.

483
00:51:47,391 --> 00:51:48,991
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just shaking my head and agreeing.

484
00:51:49,492 --> 00:51:53,393
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually really liked this change and was going to suggest something similar, so.

485
00:51:55,376 --> 00:51:56,456
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Russo?

486
00:51:57,097 --> 00:51:57,897
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, Member McLeod.

487
00:51:59,137 --> 00:52:12,842
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I think we've been looking for language like this across the district on sort of all of our documents, what have you, sort of it's this, that we're a welcoming community and that we don't discriminate and so on and so forth.

488
00:52:12,862 --> 00:52:20,124
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would add this, you know, that blurb that we are hoping that is going to exist across all platforms.

489
00:52:20,324 --> 00:52:22,165
[SPEAKER_04]: And I believe that there's a draft of that

490
00:52:23,023 --> 00:52:27,667
[SPEAKER_04]: that we have worked on and that we should be considering.

491
00:52:27,768 --> 00:52:31,551
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't have it with me, but do you know what I'm talking about?

492
00:52:31,651 --> 00:52:33,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, I'm sure the superintendent does.

493
00:52:33,853 --> 00:52:34,134
[SPEAKER_04]: I do.

494
00:52:36,215 --> 00:52:37,116
[SPEAKER_11]: Member McLaughlin.

495
00:52:37,276 --> 00:52:48,387
[SPEAKER_11]: So this sentence though is, so the next item on the agenda is our agenda creation or a modified agenda format.

496
00:52:48,862 --> 00:52:54,028
[SPEAKER_11]: And so this sentence would be literally read by the super, by the mayor at each meeting.

497
00:52:54,488 --> 00:53:04,940
[SPEAKER_11]: So brevity is important because, you know, as member Graham mentioned, you know, if there are no, I apologize, that's different sections.

498
00:53:05,941 --> 00:53:09,045
[SPEAKER_11]: So this would get read every meeting and, you know,

499
00:53:09,863 --> 00:53:11,766
[SPEAKER_11]: So that for me brevity is important.

500
00:53:11,866 --> 00:53:15,571
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, sure, I mean, but for me, yeah, I hear you.

501
00:53:15,611 --> 00:53:17,193
[SPEAKER_04]: And I and I understand the point.

502
00:53:17,293 --> 00:53:24,623
[SPEAKER_04]: And we all you know, we'll all be, I'm sure very glad to have the hopefully the long zoom statement that we've been reading for years.

503
00:53:25,404 --> 00:53:25,604
[SPEAKER_04]: You know,

504
00:53:26,307 --> 00:53:29,288
[SPEAKER_04]: Fade away, but I mean, not for years, but for months paid away.

505
00:53:29,308 --> 00:53:38,650
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but I do think that we could work towards, and I don't know that we need to wordsmith it now, but you know, I think we could work towards something that's just feels a little bit more inclusive.

506
00:53:38,990 --> 00:53:43,911
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, for me, um, I think that I would like it to move us towards this goal.

507
00:53:44,531 --> 00:53:51,693
[SPEAKER_04]: We, um, acknowledge all residents have the same rights and responsibilities, regardless of the duration of their residency in our city.

508
00:53:52,497 --> 00:53:57,159
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, and that the school committee does not discriminate on the basis of blah, blah, blah, and that's it.

509
00:53:58,299 --> 00:53:59,800
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's just five more words.

510
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:08,943
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know that I, it feels out of place because what we're saying is, okay, welcome to our meeting, speak.

511
00:54:09,884 --> 00:54:10,364
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

512
00:54:10,824 --> 00:54:15,086
[SPEAKER_11]: And whether we discriminate or not, which I mean, obviously we, we don't, but,

513
00:54:17,161 --> 00:54:19,863
[SPEAKER_11]: doesn't seem relevant to the person who is about to speak.

514
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:26,286
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a sort of like almost an instruction to the member of the public that is here before us to speak.

515
00:54:27,326 --> 00:54:37,152
[SPEAKER_11]: And the fact that we don't discriminate or that it's our policy that we don't discriminate seems out of place to me.

516
00:54:37,672 --> 00:54:45,156
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not that it shouldn't, like I see it actually on some school committees, literally it's on their agenda right at the bottom of this like nice fancy font.

517
00:54:46,307 --> 00:54:49,049
[SPEAKER_11]: And maybe that's actually something to consider.

518
00:54:50,791 --> 00:54:56,515
[SPEAKER_11]: But it just seems like an odd way to like lead into, hi, I'd like to hear what you have to say.

519
00:54:56,576 --> 00:54:58,537
[SPEAKER_11]: By the way, the school committee doesn't discriminate.

520
00:54:59,058 --> 00:55:03,842
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems... And I get, thank you, member Rousseau, may I?

521
00:55:04,868 --> 00:55:05,588
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, yes, of course.

522
00:55:05,668 --> 00:55:05,868
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

523
00:55:05,968 --> 00:55:09,710
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess for me, I feel like this seems out of place without that.

524
00:55:09,830 --> 00:55:16,052
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't understand sort of why we're stating that without something regarding our inclusivity of all.

525
00:55:16,172 --> 00:55:22,254
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that that is what the intent is, but I'm not sure that it comes across that way.

526
00:55:22,294 --> 00:55:28,156
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like it might be a little bit more pointed in some ways, and I want to make sure that it is

527
00:55:29,267 --> 00:55:35,073
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not that we're saying we don't discriminate, which I think is not the strength-based language that we talked about the other night.

528
00:55:35,553 --> 00:55:48,246
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, maybe we can do the flip of that, which is that we are inclusive and, you know, and accepting or something of all, you know, individuals, something like that.

529
00:55:48,526 --> 00:55:49,207
[SPEAKER_04]: I just feel like

530
00:55:50,696 --> 00:55:53,137
[SPEAKER_04]: it's just really pointed in this particular piece.

531
00:55:53,298 --> 00:55:55,739
[SPEAKER_04]: And I feel like I want it to be broader.

532
00:55:55,779 --> 00:56:02,123
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess as I'm asking my colleagues how we make this feel inclusive for everybody.

533
00:56:02,223 --> 00:56:04,404
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that that is what the intent is.

534
00:56:04,684 --> 00:56:08,446
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, yeah, I just want to give you my two cents.

535
00:56:09,187 --> 00:56:09,847
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

536
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:10,968
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Rousseau.

537
00:56:11,659 --> 00:56:11,839
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

538
00:56:13,261 --> 00:56:17,907
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess, um, you know, one thing we could consider is say to move us towards this goal.

539
00:56:17,987 --> 00:56:21,732
[SPEAKER_02]: We acknowledge that all residents have the same rights and responsibilities.

540
00:56:22,833 --> 00:56:24,535
[SPEAKER_02]: And and then, um.

541
00:56:25,819 --> 00:56:36,809
[SPEAKER_02]: and ask that during public participation, participants remain respectful and constructive or something like that.

542
00:56:37,150 --> 00:56:44,797
[SPEAKER_02]: So it sort of points to like, we're trying to do this and we need your help to maintain that during this section.

543
00:56:45,517 --> 00:56:50,282
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, the residency piece like,

544
00:56:51,578 --> 00:57:03,265
[SPEAKER_02]: comes out like as a stated thing, which I think is fine if, you know, cause I don't think that's the only way that public participation can feel very unwelcoming for some.

545
00:57:03,485 --> 00:57:16,353
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think if we try to say, we're trying to make this portion of our agenda welcoming and a place where we can, you know,

546
00:57:16,775 --> 00:57:19,317
[SPEAKER_02]: hear constructively from people.

547
00:57:20,077 --> 00:57:23,239
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like that's really the goal we're trying to get to.

548
00:57:23,379 --> 00:57:30,563
[SPEAKER_02]: So perhaps that is a way to solve this and be inclusive.

549
00:57:31,344 --> 00:57:35,547
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, something you said just made what member McLaughlin said make more sense to me.

550
00:57:36,487 --> 00:57:44,552
[SPEAKER_11]: Because if we took out that regardless of the duration of your residency and put like, regardless of your gender or regardless of your, we can go through the list.

551
00:57:47,302 --> 00:57:50,846
[SPEAKER_11]: it does feel like there's only one thing on this list.

552
00:57:51,026 --> 00:57:59,857
[SPEAKER_11]: And that is what I think member McLaughlin was really getting at was that's just one of the things that can make our meetings not always feel very welcoming.

553
00:58:00,498 --> 00:58:01,259
[SPEAKER_04]: exactly.

554
00:58:01,439 --> 00:58:10,207
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think may I remember or so and I think that yes, Graham Yeah, to member Graham's point, I think, and thank you for articulating member through the chair member Graham.

555
00:58:11,308 --> 00:58:13,970
[SPEAKER_04]: I think to the point is that that's what this is.

556
00:58:14,351 --> 00:58:17,914
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what the intention of this is, is that it is an opportunity to offer

557
00:58:18,414 --> 00:58:25,838
[SPEAKER_04]: constructive, respectful feedback that we can really chew on and think about in terms of how we can implement around policy.

558
00:58:25,878 --> 00:58:37,525
[SPEAKER_04]: And to that end, I would even, and again, and this maybe could be in a footer or something like that, but to that end, the same thing, that if you require accommodations for public speaking, please let us know, right?

559
00:58:38,025 --> 00:58:51,158
[SPEAKER_04]: So there might be an instance where a person needs a chair to be able to publicly speak, you know, because they can't stand for a sustained amount of time or, you know, they need, you know, just I'm thinking about, you know, any number of things in terms of our ways of being inclusive.

560
00:58:51,258 --> 00:59:01,828
[SPEAKER_04]: A microphone that is a handheld microphone instead of one that, you know, especially if an individual is in a wheelchair and needs to come up to that podium, you know, it's going to be difficult for them to,

561
00:59:02,428 --> 00:59:03,929
[SPEAKER_04]: to access the microphone.

562
00:59:03,969 --> 00:59:12,392
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think just, you know, again, thinking about how we're being the most inclusive across the board is really the point and so that we can welcome participation.

563
00:59:12,412 --> 00:59:14,373
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

564
00:59:15,154 --> 00:59:18,175
[SPEAKER_11]: Dr. Robinson, did you seem to, I thought you might have had something to say.

565
00:59:19,396 --> 00:59:35,395
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I had initially raised my hand because as I looked at the first sentence, I was just thinking of being in an actual meeting and listening to the public comment portion being read.

566
00:59:36,175 --> 00:59:45,158
[SPEAKER_07]: and just saying, you know, a welcoming inclusive community is both the value of the school committee and an aspirational goal.

567
00:59:45,738 --> 01:00:04,045
[SPEAKER_07]: And then just one additional sentence to just say, you know, not in the sense that we're admonishing, but, you know, as a reminder, respectful interactions are the, you know, expectation of all participants, something along those lines.

568
01:00:05,225 --> 01:00:08,670
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, you know, to, you know, to learn from one another.

569
01:00:08,690 --> 01:00:11,353
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just was feeling like,

570
01:00:15,124 --> 01:00:37,150
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, we know we want to move towards that goal, but I almost feel like that could just be eliminated and saying that, you know, when it's being read over and over again, that the Medford School Committee is saying that, you know, they endorse, they support, they want to hear the feedback, which is what you've been sharing and stating.

571
01:00:37,891 --> 01:00:38,891
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I think

572
01:00:39,998 --> 01:00:52,585
[SPEAKER_07]: having it worded that way, that you are, you know, you want us to continue to be a welcoming, inclusive community, that it is a value of the school committee and an aspirational goal.

573
01:00:53,145 --> 01:00:56,567
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, okay, I see what you're writing there.

574
01:00:56,847 --> 01:01:01,949
[SPEAKER_07]: And we ask for your help in achieving this goal through, you know, maintaining, you know,

575
01:01:04,035 --> 01:01:21,185
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, respectful or appropriate tones of forms of communication, and that I feel like that would make sense and then the people would raise their hand or come up to the podium, those who are physically there.

576
01:01:23,442 --> 01:01:37,562
[SPEAKER_07]: Because if we're saying we're welcoming, we're inclusive, we've already stated in the statement that they need to say their name and their address and then ask their question or comment.

577
01:01:40,057 --> 01:01:42,379
[SPEAKER_07]: all of those other pieces kind of fall into place.

578
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:44,821
[SPEAKER_07]: So that that's what was going through my mind.

579
01:01:45,402 --> 01:01:54,852
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if that's an acceptable suggestion, but I actually just feel that first sentence is something that when they hear that it's

580
01:01:55,412 --> 01:01:58,273
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, this is a welcoming, inclusive environment.

581
01:01:58,794 --> 01:02:04,816
[SPEAKER_07]: We're at this meeting of the school committee, and we ask for your help in achieving this goal.

582
01:02:05,116 --> 01:02:17,682
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think keeping it concise and at the same time delivering a clear message, but positively expressing the values of the school committee.

583
01:02:19,303 --> 01:02:20,944
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Dr. Edvinson.

584
01:02:21,544 --> 01:02:23,585
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I actually like that sentence that you

585
01:02:24,471 --> 01:02:38,781
[SPEAKER_11]: suggested and literally just ending there, because when it ends there, it does kind of drop, you know, like that mic drop thing that, you know, like, here we are, and here's what we would like you to help us with.

586
01:02:39,041 --> 01:02:48,047
[SPEAKER_11]: And it feels, I think, I remember Graham said that, or maybe it was Aaron McLaughlin about the whole, it's, you know, we need your help.

587
01:02:49,620 --> 01:02:52,442
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I remember Rousseau, I remember McLaughlin, sorry.

588
01:02:52,803 --> 01:02:54,945
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I really also, I do, I really like that.

589
01:02:55,145 --> 01:02:57,447
[SPEAKER_04]: We need your help, you know, we need your help doing this.

590
01:02:57,507 --> 01:03:02,211
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not sure that I said it, but I do think that, you know, the superintendent articulated it.

591
01:03:02,331 --> 01:03:11,078
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I think it does feel more welcoming and realizing, oh, they value, you know, we need your help and value your, you know, opinion or something, but that they value me speaking right now.

592
01:03:11,138 --> 01:03:13,560
[SPEAKER_04]: And they really do want to hear from me, I think is the important piece.

593
01:03:15,882 --> 01:03:16,222
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

594
01:03:16,242 --> 01:03:17,103
[SPEAKER_11]: So if I,

595
01:03:19,187 --> 01:03:21,709
[SPEAKER_11]: ditch all of that and add that.

596
01:03:22,649 --> 01:03:25,471
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm saying that forgetting that member of my class can't see my screen.

597
01:03:26,332 --> 01:03:27,012
[SPEAKER_11]: We add the word.

598
01:03:27,373 --> 01:03:31,796
[SPEAKER_11]: So the new statement as I have it on screen right now, be a welcoming, inclusive community.

599
01:03:31,896 --> 01:03:34,878
[SPEAKER_11]: It's both a value of the school community and an aspirational goal.

600
01:03:35,338 --> 01:03:41,142
[SPEAKER_11]: We ask for your help in achieving this, this goal, this goal.

601
01:03:43,044 --> 01:03:44,945
[SPEAKER_11]: Or do we get rid of the end and aspirational goal?

602
01:03:47,407 --> 01:03:47,647
[SPEAKER_11]: Feels

603
01:03:49,595 --> 01:03:50,255
[SPEAKER_03]: member Russo.

604
01:03:50,835 --> 01:03:51,116
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

605
01:03:52,216 --> 01:04:01,219
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think the first, yeah, I think you repeating it is fine in achieving this goal or our goal, because, you know, you're repeating what you're referring to it.

606
01:04:01,579 --> 01:04:02,580
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that that's fine.

607
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:05,120
[SPEAKER_04]: I can see your screen now.

608
01:04:06,761 --> 01:04:08,642
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that's, that's good.

609
01:04:09,822 --> 01:04:10,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

610
01:04:10,982 --> 01:04:15,264
[SPEAKER_04]: We ask for your help in achieving this goal, you know, and value your opinion.

611
01:04:15,504 --> 01:04:18,205
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I would just, opinions are opinion.

612
01:04:24,598 --> 01:04:27,340
[SPEAKER_11]: comments, given that it's the public comment section.

613
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:29,622
[SPEAKER_11]: Perspective.

614
01:04:29,742 --> 01:04:31,603
[SPEAKER_11]: Your, yeah, like perspective.

615
01:04:38,428 --> 01:04:47,595
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, we can probably go all night, but does anybody in the public, Member Graham, Member McLaughlin, I think you're, I seem to think you're okay.

616
01:04:48,916 --> 01:04:53,119
[SPEAKER_11]: Does anybody else want to speak on this change to this language?

617
01:04:54,494 --> 01:05:13,643
[SPEAKER_11]: If you can raise your hand with the Zoom raise your hand thing, or... All right, seeing and hearing none, I will make sure that this gets, I don't wanna mess with these things on Google, because I may end up deleting the wrong thing, but I will make sure.

618
01:05:13,663 --> 01:05:14,663
[SPEAKER_11]: So is there a motion?

619
01:05:14,764 --> 01:05:15,904
[SPEAKER_02]: Need a motion to approve?

620
01:05:16,684 --> 01:05:16,985
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

621
01:05:17,505 --> 01:05:18,545
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, motion to approve.

622
01:05:20,206 --> 01:05:20,506
[SPEAKER_02]: Second.

623
01:05:21,967 --> 01:05:23,047
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, Member Graham?

624
01:05:23,748 --> 01:05:23,948
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

625
01:05:24,780 --> 01:05:25,721
[SPEAKER_11]: Member McLaughlin?

626
01:05:26,181 --> 01:05:26,541
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

627
01:05:27,121 --> 01:05:27,722
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Rousseau?

628
01:05:27,802 --> 01:05:28,062
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

629
01:05:28,702 --> 01:05:29,143
[SPEAKER_11]: Excellent.

630
01:05:29,183 --> 01:05:37,228
[SPEAKER_11]: So the new public participation policy, proposed public participation policy will be sent to the school committee on Monday the 14th.

631
01:05:37,828 --> 01:05:48,755
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I'm going to switch us to the third item on our agenda, which was the policy BEDB, the agenda creation and format for regular meetings of the school committee.

632
01:05:49,655 --> 01:05:54,158
[SPEAKER_11]: At our last meeting, we also, this is a dramatic

633
01:05:54,767 --> 01:05:55,187
[SPEAKER_11]: change.

634
01:05:55,548 --> 01:05:57,469
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, I think it's entirely new as well.

635
01:05:58,430 --> 01:06:00,592
[SPEAKER_11]: I had an interesting email with a member of the public.

636
01:06:04,155 --> 01:06:06,437
[SPEAKER_11]: Now I'm forgetting which member of the public it was.

637
01:06:06,517 --> 01:06:08,338
[SPEAKER_11]: I had an interesting email exchange this week.

638
01:06:09,039 --> 01:06:20,168
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was related to Monday's meeting where I think everyone was confused, frankly, as to when and how

639
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:24,363
[SPEAKER_11]: the public was supposed to get their opportunity to speak.

640
01:06:24,383 --> 01:06:29,166
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think anybody was actually clear on what was happening on Monday there.

641
01:06:29,786 --> 01:06:37,312
[SPEAKER_11]: And in that email dialogue, it became very evident that there was something I articulated in my email that I thought was important.

642
01:06:38,564 --> 01:06:46,027
[SPEAKER_11]: And I also had another email with another school committee member in another town today, whose entire school committee is new with a new superintendent starting July one.

643
01:06:46,427 --> 01:06:50,788
[SPEAKER_11]: Like there is nobody with historical information to help them continue.

644
01:06:50,868 --> 01:06:52,168
[SPEAKER_11]: And I feel really bad for them.

645
01:06:53,929 --> 01:07:06,573
[SPEAKER_11]: And, but anyways, my point was, you know, we had a new mayor in January of last year, a still relatively new superintendent and the way we run our meetings wasn't written down, frankly.

646
01:07:07,503 --> 01:07:11,446
[SPEAKER_11]: It was, you know, historical or whatever that right word is.

647
01:07:11,946 --> 01:07:19,912
[SPEAKER_11]: And so, and you know, the mayor quickly became capable of running our meetings just fine, but she had not been on the school committee before.

648
01:07:20,372 --> 01:07:27,957
[SPEAKER_11]: So she really came to our meeting with frankly, I think a experienced deficit that can only exist by doing it.

649
01:07:29,978 --> 01:07:33,320
[SPEAKER_11]: But we had nothing to give her to say, this is how we run our meetings.

650
01:07:34,572 --> 01:07:43,537
[SPEAKER_11]: So in that email exchange, I realized that we probably should provide something much more explicit.

651
01:07:43,977 --> 01:07:48,259
[SPEAKER_11]: So this policy is not what the agenda looks like.

652
01:07:48,319 --> 01:07:53,822
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, that is partially in here, but it's a how-to, how to create the agenda.

653
01:07:54,322 --> 01:07:59,265
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's also a how-to for, in some regards, for the mayor, the chair.

654
01:07:59,925 --> 01:08:03,087
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is a sentence, a section I added

655
01:08:03,577 --> 01:08:06,479
[SPEAKER_11]: since our last meeting as a potential offer.

656
01:08:09,681 --> 01:08:23,671
[SPEAKER_11]: And what it says is that as each item under sections five, six, and seven, sorry, the chair will proceed as follows.

657
01:08:24,731 --> 01:08:26,633
[SPEAKER_11]: Read the text of the item on the agenda.

658
01:08:27,733 --> 01:08:31,436
[SPEAKER_11]: The chair will ask, are there any members of the public who wish to speak on this item?

659
01:08:32,269 --> 01:08:38,970
[SPEAKER_11]: The chair will wait the appropriate few seconds to look around and wait for Zoom people to pop their hands up.

660
01:08:39,991 --> 01:08:45,352
[SPEAKER_11]: And if none, the chair will state seeing and hearing none and then proceed.

661
01:08:45,392 --> 01:08:48,812
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is actually very similar to language I believe the city council uses.

662
01:08:49,553 --> 01:08:52,573
[SPEAKER_11]: And I certainly have appreciated hearing that.

663
01:08:54,194 --> 01:09:00,895
[SPEAKER_11]: And then the chair will then ask the vice chair, are there any public comments that you have received

664
01:09:02,076 --> 01:09:03,497
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is the emails.

665
01:09:04,958 --> 01:09:08,880
[SPEAKER_11]: If somebody physically delivers a letter, if there are, they will be read.

666
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:13,022
[SPEAKER_11]: And otherwise the chair will proceed with the item to engage the committee.

667
01:09:13,422 --> 01:09:18,345
[SPEAKER_11]: Now this last part of this sentence, I don't actually know what the best practice is.

668
01:09:18,805 --> 01:09:23,748
[SPEAKER_11]: Should the committee have a conversation about an item before or after public comment?

669
01:09:24,328 --> 01:09:29,891
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel strongly that it should not be both, because it will just go on all night.

670
01:09:31,830 --> 01:09:37,935
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know in some school committees, all public comment for the whole night is like the first 20 minutes of the agenda.

671
01:09:38,155 --> 01:09:39,736
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a signup sheet, 20 minutes is up.

672
01:09:39,956 --> 01:09:44,300
[SPEAKER_11]: Whoever didn't get to talk is done, which I just think is too much.

673
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:47,862
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not how I understand Medford.

674
01:09:48,163 --> 01:09:58,871
[SPEAKER_11]: And maybe we do need to eventually add some limit on time, but the question I'm asking member Graham and member McLaughlin is, do we want public participation

675
01:10:00,677 --> 01:10:04,739
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry, I'm calling it public participation, public comment.

676
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:14,304
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we want public comment to proceed before we do our debate on an item that we're gonna vote on or after?

677
01:10:15,245 --> 01:10:19,807
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we vote at the end, like I- Sometimes, yes.

678
01:10:20,495 --> 01:10:20,655
[SPEAKER_11]: please.

679
01:10:20,875 --> 01:10:30,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's curious because sometimes people are waiting for the agenda item to be able to discuss it because they want us to sort of present on it and then they want to respond to it is sort of my inclination.

680
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:39,864
[SPEAKER_04]: But at the same time, I feel like we don't want people sitting there until 10 or 11 at night because they're waiting for some agenda item that, you know, we've addressed.

681
01:10:39,904 --> 01:10:46,327
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm a little bit, I guess I'm asking my colleagues how you would handle how you would suggest we handle that situation.

682
01:10:49,729 --> 01:10:59,498
[SPEAKER_02]: I, so I guess I think, you know, certainly the, there has to be enough substance that anybody could understand what we're talking about, right?

683
01:10:59,579 --> 01:11:04,003
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes that's not the case until a presentation has been delivered.

684
01:11:05,104 --> 01:11:10,870
[SPEAKER_02]: So certainly I would expect that a presentation or what have you be delivered.

685
01:11:12,915 --> 01:11:16,179
[SPEAKER_02]: first or a description of what's going on.

686
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:20,904
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do like hearing from the public first.

687
01:11:23,158 --> 01:11:31,382
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think it gives the public an opportunity to provide us their thoughts in a constructive way without being influenced by what we have to say.

688
01:11:31,403 --> 01:11:43,189
[SPEAKER_02]: And to allow us to sort of like reflect on that before we dive in and start asking our questions, which may, you know, sometimes there's probably overlap so

689
01:11:43,952 --> 01:11:57,699
[SPEAKER_02]: But I also think when I tend to agree with you that when public comment happens before, during, and after the committee also asking questions, what gets, I think, really confusing is that

690
01:12:01,404 --> 01:12:03,826
[SPEAKER_02]: We are not supposed to be addressing the public.

691
01:12:03,967 --> 01:12:08,651
[SPEAKER_02]: It is not a conversation, you know, that we're having under Robert's rules.

692
01:12:09,352 --> 01:12:17,340
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do think being clear about like, are we taking public comment and then we're talking or vice versa could go a long way to.

693
01:12:20,203 --> 01:12:35,813
[SPEAKER_02]: frankly making our meetings feel more constructive because I think at times that tension of, I've just said something and I'm expecting you to respond and we're not, that's really not what's supposed to be happening is really dissatisfying for people.

694
01:12:35,873 --> 01:12:47,601
[SPEAKER_02]: And this could help, I think this could help if we were certainly clear one way or the other, but I would tend to want to hear from the public before we provide our comments and questions.

695
01:12:48,607 --> 01:12:49,287
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Russo.

696
01:12:50,008 --> 01:12:50,228
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

697
01:12:50,408 --> 01:12:51,429
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

698
01:12:51,489 --> 01:12:54,550
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have a raised hand option with my thing, so I apologize.

699
01:12:55,751 --> 01:12:58,352
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think, again, it's just context.

700
01:12:58,612 --> 01:13:08,238
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think if you are, say, new to the community or if you're watching online or what have you, and people are all getting up and commenting about something, but you don't know why,

701
01:13:09,238 --> 01:13:11,719
[SPEAKER_04]: It's sort of confusing or what the background is.

702
01:13:11,759 --> 01:13:13,039
[SPEAKER_04]: It's sort of confusing or where you're at.

703
01:13:13,059 --> 01:13:21,140
[SPEAKER_04]: It's sort of like getting the end of the story first, but I do hear what you're saying about having it, you know, sort of having the feedback before.

704
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:27,101
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we're not actually, well, we could be voting, but we're not deliberating obviously with the community.

705
01:13:27,161 --> 01:13:34,163
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess it's a little chicken and egg, but I feel like there are times when there needs to be some context.

706
01:13:34,203 --> 01:13:36,303
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe there's an option that we could say,

707
01:13:36,923 --> 01:13:37,304
[SPEAKER_04]: Sarah Silver, PB.:

708
01:13:37,304 --> 01:13:38,766
[SPEAKER_04]: : You know, prior to public participation.

709
01:13:38,806 --> 01:13:45,396
[SPEAKER_04]: If there's if there seems to be an agenda item that is clearly, you know, Sarah Silver, PB.:

710
01:13:45,396 --> 01:13:50,584
[SPEAKER_04]: : A public concern or something we could offer a little bit of context or something.

711
01:13:50,644 --> 01:13:51,044
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

712
01:13:51,285 --> 01:13:52,607
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to think about how we

713
01:13:53,710 --> 01:13:59,374
[SPEAKER_04]: we address that so that there's some context so people know why these comments are happening or what the comments are about.

714
01:13:59,615 --> 01:14:13,866
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe, you know, I know that they have the agenda, but some people might not look, you know, forward that forward in things, or, you know, maybe watching online and not having the agenda or not looking online to get, I mean, watching on TV and not looking online to get the agenda.

715
01:14:13,906 --> 01:14:15,007
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know.

716
01:14:15,367 --> 01:14:21,652
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, and so also, I just wanted to ask you, this isn't, I just want to clarify for the community as well that

717
01:14:22,189 --> 01:14:23,630
[SPEAKER_04]: the public participation here.

718
01:14:23,670 --> 01:14:35,435
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, you know, we haven't said that there's a specific time limit, but previously it was that you had three minutes to talk on any of the individual topics that we had on the agenda.

719
01:14:35,535 --> 01:14:40,618
[SPEAKER_04]: And is what this is suggesting is that you go into this block for public comment.

720
01:14:40,958 --> 01:14:47,301
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you missed that block during the meeting, you don't have the opportunity for the three minutes during a particular item.

721
01:14:48,742 --> 01:14:49,182
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I mean,

722
01:14:50,745 --> 01:15:04,195
[SPEAKER_11]: That's actually, I mean, you know, if you don't get up and do your public comment when the item is being addressed on the agenda, you can't get up, you know, 10 minutes later, a half an hour later and talk about that item.

723
01:15:04,575 --> 01:15:06,437
[SPEAKER_04]: That's current practice.

724
01:15:06,657 --> 01:15:08,278
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I know, I think you're misunderstanding me.

725
01:15:08,678 --> 01:15:18,606
[SPEAKER_04]: What I'm saying is that if the agenda hosts this item, you know, public comment, okay, that's its own standalone item, okay?

726
01:15:18,646 --> 01:15:19,846
[SPEAKER_11]: No, sorry.

727
01:15:21,238 --> 01:15:25,021
[SPEAKER_11]: Member McLaughlin, sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt, but if I did mean to interrupt, I apologize for it.

728
01:15:26,161 --> 01:15:39,410
[SPEAKER_11]: No, the public comment is not actually an item on the agenda because it would be an item on every, it would be every item on the agenda would have a public comment section.

729
01:15:39,591 --> 01:15:42,032
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is sort of the precursor.

730
01:15:42,052 --> 01:15:46,175
[SPEAKER_11]: This is not on the agenda specifically because then the agenda would be 30 pages.

731
01:15:46,335 --> 01:15:48,837
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it would be multiple pages long

732
01:15:49,652 --> 01:15:54,973
[SPEAKER_11]: where we just state over and over again that this is how public comment works.

733
01:15:55,613 --> 01:16:10,836
[SPEAKER_11]: So what you'll see later on is that, so after this report of the superintendent, assuming we agreed to this format, the mayor will read the statement that says, this is our policy on public comment and I'll fix all that.

734
01:16:12,156 --> 01:16:13,216
[SPEAKER_11]: She will read that once.

735
01:16:14,816 --> 01:16:18,197
[SPEAKER_11]: Then the actual items on the agenda will happen.

736
01:16:19,176 --> 01:16:25,939
[SPEAKER_11]: And then, you know, like under new business, there's a motion that I put on to do something or ask superintendent for something.

737
01:16:26,519 --> 01:16:29,920
[SPEAKER_11]: The chair will read the item on the agenda, which she does now.

738
01:16:30,581 --> 01:16:33,942
[SPEAKER_11]: And then the chair will say, are there any members of the public who wish to speak on the item?

739
01:16:35,611 --> 01:16:36,491
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, perfect.

740
01:16:36,631 --> 01:16:37,152
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, perfect.

741
01:16:37,172 --> 01:16:37,812
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

742
01:16:38,092 --> 01:16:38,812
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, excuse me.

743
01:16:38,832 --> 01:16:39,112
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

744
01:16:39,132 --> 01:16:39,853
[SPEAKER_04]: I was misunderstanding.

745
01:16:40,253 --> 01:16:47,316
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought the question was, I thought you were talking about a segment where it was public participation, not on each of the items that she's reading that.

746
01:16:47,336 --> 01:16:47,996
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's great.

747
01:16:48,036 --> 01:16:50,517
[SPEAKER_04]: So then the question, now I'm confused about the other question.

748
01:16:51,037 --> 01:17:03,682
[SPEAKER_04]: My apologies, where the committee, the chair is saying this and you are saying, we are asking now, will the chair say this prior to the presentation or agenda item or after the presentation or the agenda item?

749
01:17:03,722 --> 01:17:04,262
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that correct?

750
01:17:04,988 --> 01:17:06,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that what we're asking right now?

751
01:17:06,909 --> 01:17:10,631
[SPEAKER_11]: No, that part I thought, I hadn't imagined there was any real conversation.

752
01:17:10,651 --> 01:17:13,653
[SPEAKER_11]: The chair will read the text or the presentation will be delivered.

753
01:17:14,533 --> 01:17:17,074
[SPEAKER_11]: And then the public will have an opportunity to comment.

754
01:17:19,155 --> 01:17:23,978
[SPEAKER_04]: So what are we debating now about whether the public participation comes before or after?

755
01:17:24,038 --> 01:17:24,878
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you talking about?

756
01:17:26,199 --> 01:17:33,583
[SPEAKER_11]: Whether it comes before or after, we, the members, do our bit where we ask questions and we

757
01:17:34,327 --> 01:17:39,792
[SPEAKER_11]: make motions and amendments and vote up and down on whatever the item is.

758
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:44,602
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, to me, it's weird that we would vote and then listen to the public.

759
01:17:44,662 --> 01:17:48,565
[SPEAKER_11]: That doesn't seem very... Right, no, you're right.

760
01:17:48,745 --> 01:17:50,306
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think, I'm sorry.

761
01:17:50,726 --> 01:17:51,767
[SPEAKER_04]: So yes, I agree.

762
01:17:52,467 --> 01:17:56,629
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm getting this mixed up in terms of topics and having public participation as an agenda item.

763
01:17:56,649 --> 01:18:07,275
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would agree with the chair and with member Graham that we would hear the public on the agenda items after the chair asks, is there any...

764
01:18:08,276 --> 01:18:15,418
[SPEAKER_04]: public participation on this comment, what have you, and then we act as a school committee and do the things that we need to do as a school committee.

765
01:18:15,498 --> 01:18:17,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that what is being suggested?

766
01:18:17,099 --> 01:18:17,159
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

767
01:18:17,679 --> 01:18:17,879
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

768
01:18:17,899 --> 01:18:18,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

769
01:18:18,379 --> 01:18:19,500
[SPEAKER_04]: And I am in agreement with that.

770
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:20,660
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for clarifying.

771
01:18:20,680 --> 01:18:21,761
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

772
01:18:22,121 --> 01:18:26,802
[SPEAKER_02]: I did wonder if any members of the public had thoughts about this.

773
01:18:27,863 --> 01:18:30,664
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Gambis, before that, Dr. Edward-Vincent has her hand up.

774
01:18:33,745 --> 01:18:34,145
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

775
01:18:36,775 --> 01:19:01,727
[SPEAKER_07]: Just as I was listening to the conversation and thinking about the meetings and the amount of time that goes into planning for the meetings and thinking about the reports that are going to be presented, and just thinking about the amount of content that can be presented in a reasonable amount of time,

776
01:19:03,875 --> 01:19:15,278
[SPEAKER_07]: I personally would prefer possibly having two designated areas on the agenda for both public and community participation.

777
01:19:15,298 --> 01:19:24,340
[SPEAKER_07]: To have it be at designated points, I do feel like, especially where we have multiple reports

778
01:19:25,094 --> 01:19:41,607
[SPEAKER_07]: being presented if after every single report that's presented where the school committee is being asked to provide feedback, their perspective, their expertise to weigh in on the initiatives that the district is doing.

779
01:19:42,448 --> 01:19:50,514
[SPEAKER_07]: And then to add between every single report, I think last week we had like nine or 10 reports,

780
01:19:51,395 --> 01:19:53,836
[SPEAKER_07]: We could be talking about seven hour meetings.

781
01:19:54,697 --> 01:20:05,983
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, I would, I was thinking more about where you divided up the sections earlier and I know the numbers are going to change but

782
01:20:08,107 --> 01:20:24,000
[SPEAKER_07]: If community participation and public comment is moved to the top of the agenda before the report of the committees, if it's moved all the way up to the top and people are able to give their feedback, we have the report of the committees.

783
01:20:25,855 --> 01:20:47,645
[SPEAKER_07]: where you present all of the information that's happening at subcommittee meetings and other pertinent school committee information, and then we get to the report of the superintendent, I would almost say it would be better to have one other section built into the agenda.

784
01:20:47,665 --> 01:20:48,746
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel the meat

785
01:20:53,502 --> 01:20:59,624
[SPEAKER_07]: or a substantive part of the agenda should be the reports that are being presented about the school district.

786
01:21:00,484 --> 01:21:08,966
[SPEAKER_07]: And so after the report of the superintendent and where you, the school committee present new information under old business and new business.

787
01:21:09,646 --> 01:21:20,429
[SPEAKER_07]: So right at the end of new business to leave a specific amount of time to ask for public participation or comments

788
01:21:20,969 --> 01:21:33,317
[SPEAKER_07]: at that point in time, because I just feel like we've had some fairly long meetings, and we, as just human beings, we lose stamina.

789
01:21:33,838 --> 01:21:43,784
[SPEAKER_07]: And I also think just about members of the team where, you know, when it's 10 and 11 o'clock at night, you know, we are not our sharpest.

790
01:21:43,844 --> 01:21:45,305
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not our best thinking.

791
01:21:46,006 --> 01:21:46,526
[SPEAKER_07]: And so,

792
01:21:48,326 --> 01:21:56,601
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm thinking if we designate the areas, if we do it at the top of the meeting, listen to comments,

793
01:21:57,793 --> 01:22:19,713
[SPEAKER_07]: let the report of committees happen, report of the superintendent, old business, new business, and then provide that other opportunity at the tail end if there was an additional commentary that people wanted to just add the comments, but know that we're not deliberating.

794
01:22:20,954 --> 01:22:24,037
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that then the community will understand

795
01:22:24,597 --> 01:22:38,926
[SPEAKER_07]: they can speak at the top of the meeting or they'll be able to have an opportunity to speak, you know, after new business, because I think speaking after every single item

796
01:22:41,604 --> 01:22:56,112
[SPEAKER_07]: It just in some of the items really require you the school committee to deliberate amongst yourselves that I just feel for the purpose of really having focused more focused meetings.

797
01:22:57,272 --> 01:23:19,366
[SPEAKER_07]: that that would help to clearly identify, clearly say, these are the times where we're taking public comment, where, you know, because last week was the first time we were back in chambers in over a year, in over 15 months, there was kind of confusion, you know, at the public participation point.

798
01:23:19,927 --> 01:23:24,770
[SPEAKER_07]: So that was just a suggestion, but I just feel for the purposes of

799
01:23:25,710 --> 01:23:33,115
[SPEAKER_07]: running an orderly meeting and being able to present the new information so that you, the school committee, can deliberate.

800
01:23:34,095 --> 01:23:44,141
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what we should be hearing your feedback, whether it's about subcommittees or whether it's about reports that are being presented, and then

801
01:23:46,457 --> 01:24:08,119
[SPEAKER_07]: allow opportunities for the public to participate or to comment but for them to understand that it's not deliberation that you know yes they're able to comment and we will listen and you know take notes but it's it's the deliberation is you the school committee and I just feel we probably need to

802
01:24:08,840 --> 01:24:14,561
[SPEAKER_07]: have tighter guardrails in order for the meetings to be very efficient.

803
01:24:14,761 --> 01:24:25,044
[SPEAKER_07]: And with MASC and the feedback that they've given, efficient meetings run between an hour and a half to two hours.

804
01:24:25,604 --> 01:24:26,664
[SPEAKER_07]: And we triple that.

805
01:24:27,524 --> 01:24:32,065
[SPEAKER_07]: We have six-hour meetings, even when I think it's a very short agenda.

806
01:24:32,486 --> 01:24:38,207
[SPEAKER_07]: So I really feel like just the deliberation amongst ourselves is significant.

807
01:24:39,007 --> 01:24:57,356
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just wanted to voice that as I know we're gonna present this to the full committee on Monday, but to really think about how do we want, you know, the meetings to run, to be effective, but to also be orderly.

808
01:24:58,697 --> 01:24:58,997
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

809
01:24:59,017 --> 01:25:00,498
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Dr. Robinson.

810
01:25:00,618 --> 01:25:07,141
[SPEAKER_11]: One moment, Member McLaughlin, before I just wanted to explain something here that isn't necessarily obvious.

811
01:25:07,241 --> 01:25:08,142
[SPEAKER_11]: It is not obvious.

812
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:34,151
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, part of the motivation for redoing this agenda, absolutely one of the most important motivations was to find a way to clarify the agenda format, but also to make it so that it is, you know, you mentioned Dr. Everett Vincent, that sometimes the agenda looks super light, rarely, but sometimes, and then it's still a five hour meeting.

813
01:25:35,372 --> 01:25:38,213
[SPEAKER_11]: Like there is just no way to predict our agenda

814
01:25:38,973 --> 01:25:41,536
[SPEAKER_11]: having anything to do with how long we'll be sitting together.

815
01:25:42,116 --> 01:25:46,701
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think there are a number of causes of that.

816
01:25:47,601 --> 01:25:59,052
[SPEAKER_11]: But what I think isn't clear here is that report of the superintendent is in our last meeting on Monday, I think there were nine reports and they were all under, well, whatever the section number was then.

817
01:25:59,072 --> 01:26:01,315
[SPEAKER_11]: Those reports are not,

818
01:26:03,588 --> 01:26:06,970
[SPEAKER_11]: in my opinion, are not moments when the public is allowed to come up and talk.

819
01:26:08,510 --> 01:26:10,491
[SPEAKER_11]: These are reports that are being delivered to us.

820
01:26:10,912 --> 01:26:30,441
[SPEAKER_11]: And if we, as members of the committee, feel like there's something in there that requires us to deliberate or to make a motion or write a policy, that we, as members, make a motion to send whatever to the whatever subcommittee for whatever that purpose is that we're interested in.

821
01:26:33,956 --> 01:26:45,143
[SPEAKER_11]: Two years ago, we had a binder this big on a study that we approved with Mass General Hospital and resiliency.

822
01:26:45,683 --> 01:26:47,244
[SPEAKER_11]: My daughter actually is a participant.

823
01:26:49,505 --> 01:26:52,847
[SPEAKER_11]: The presentation was probably a half an hour, 45 minutes long, and it should have been.

824
01:26:53,048 --> 01:26:56,169
[SPEAKER_11]: And this was a very important and big decision for us to approve this.

825
01:26:57,710 --> 01:27:00,252
[SPEAKER_11]: But I did not see that as a time for the public to come up

826
01:27:00,817 --> 01:27:06,540
[SPEAKER_11]: and comment on whether we approved it or not for so many reasons.

827
01:27:06,620 --> 01:27:10,743
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, first of all, the public doesn't have this document, this thousand page binder.

828
01:27:12,484 --> 01:27:18,187
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we want to hear from people who have absolutely no way to know what it is we're deliberating on?

829
01:27:19,268 --> 01:27:20,088
[SPEAKER_11]: There is no way.

830
01:27:20,108 --> 01:27:21,889
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, we received those binders ahead of time.

831
01:27:23,070 --> 01:27:24,351
[SPEAKER_11]: We read some parts.

832
01:27:24,411 --> 01:27:27,913
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I didn't read the whole thing, but you know,

833
01:27:28,891 --> 01:27:36,033
[SPEAKER_11]: That doesn't seem like an opportunity for the public to come up and comment on something that they cannot know about, because we don't provide it to them.

834
01:27:36,093 --> 01:27:37,914
[SPEAKER_11]: It was provided to us as a presentation.

835
01:27:38,394 --> 01:27:45,156
[SPEAKER_11]: So those reports we got on Monday, we didn't have public participation in any of those, and I didn't expect us to.

836
01:27:47,457 --> 01:27:52,738
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's why, at least in this format, you do all of your reports.

837
01:27:52,938 --> 01:27:57,220
[SPEAKER_11]: At this point in the meeting, if there were no presentations of the public from the public,

838
01:27:59,218 --> 01:28:12,224
[SPEAKER_11]: you do all of those reports and the public has still not really spoken and done any public comment because the items under continued business or new business have not even been come up yet.

839
01:28:15,565 --> 01:28:27,410
[SPEAKER_11]: I certainly understand what you're saying and it is common practice in other school committees to, you know, welcome to the meeting, salute the flag and take our attendance, open the room up for half an hour

840
01:28:27,849 --> 01:28:31,612
[SPEAKER_11]: people can say whatever they want, and that's it for the night.

841
01:28:33,093 --> 01:28:44,901
[SPEAKER_11]: I just feel like Medford is so far away from that, that it just, I don't see that passing at our Monday meeting is my point.

842
01:28:46,462 --> 01:28:54,008
[SPEAKER_11]: And if we put the commentary ahead of time and at the end, the end part is gonna be after we've already voted to do something, we're gonna,

843
01:28:55,139 --> 01:28:58,961
[SPEAKER_11]: We're definitely not going to be able to achieve that language.

844
01:28:59,001 --> 01:29:04,724
[SPEAKER_11]: We ask for your help in achieving this goal and valuing your perspective when we've already made the vote.

845
01:29:06,184 --> 01:29:11,107
[SPEAKER_11]: It isn't very, doesn't feel genuine.

846
01:29:12,787 --> 01:29:16,229
[SPEAKER_11]: Member, sorry, Dr. Ever-Vincent and then Member Glocken.

847
01:29:16,550 --> 01:29:22,959
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I just was going to respond though, where we received the comment and the participation.

848
01:29:23,479 --> 01:29:24,781
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not deliberation.

849
01:29:24,801 --> 01:29:24,841
[SPEAKER_07]: So,

850
01:29:31,089 --> 01:29:43,962
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't see where allowing people to still speak, because there are some people may have written statements that they want to read or a comment, a perspective that they just want to be able to publicly share.

851
01:29:44,583 --> 01:29:46,905
[SPEAKER_07]: And that is their right to be able to do it.

852
01:29:47,586 --> 01:29:49,367
[SPEAKER_07]: But we're not deliberating.

853
01:29:49,828 --> 01:29:52,290
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I just kind of feel like

854
01:29:54,032 --> 01:30:10,686
[SPEAKER_07]: if they know they have the opportunity to speak at the top of the meeting or at, you know, that there are maybe two designated times where it's, you know, official commentary that can be made, then they also know because

855
01:30:12,207 --> 01:30:20,136
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, sometimes you know we do the bills and the payrolls those things go quickly, but depending on how many sometimes we're talking about.

856
01:30:20,677 --> 01:30:28,586
[SPEAKER_07]: Six or seven report of committees and sometimes there's critical information that the rest of the team needs to hear so that also can take time.

857
01:30:29,166 --> 01:30:43,331
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm just thinking also about, you know, do they want to be there for the entire meeting, or do they want to have an opportunity to kind of say, you know, I want to just come and present my statement to you, knowing that there are going to be other things being made.

858
01:30:43,752 --> 01:30:49,974
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just was trying to think about giving them an opportunity to speak early instead of having, you know,

859
01:30:50,983 --> 01:31:07,948
[SPEAKER_07]: people wait potentially, depending on the week, wait a good amount of time before they're able to speak, and then providing another opportunity on the tail end so they know, OK, these are the times that I'll be able to clearly speak.

860
01:31:08,028 --> 01:31:19,712
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I do feel it's important to hear the different perspectives, but it's also important to be able to have an orderly meeting.

861
01:31:21,165 --> 01:31:31,723
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, on the back end, the amount of time, the amount of reports where we're saying, okay, how many reports can we actually put forward because

862
01:31:33,107 --> 01:31:48,618
[SPEAKER_07]: It, you know, without fail, even when I thought it would be a shorter meeting, it's, so there's a lot of trying to think about how long will this take to present and trying to present meaningful reports.

863
01:31:49,179 --> 01:31:55,363
[SPEAKER_07]: And at the same time, trying to have a reasonable amount of time.

864
01:31:56,104 --> 01:31:57,144
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all that I'm saying.

865
01:31:57,164 --> 01:31:58,445
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

866
01:31:58,946 --> 01:31:59,266
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

867
01:31:59,286 --> 01:32:00,607
[SPEAKER_11]: Member McLaughlin.

868
01:32:03,242 --> 01:32:10,406
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, and to that point, I think that's where the confusion lay in my understanding of the proposed changes.

869
01:32:10,626 --> 01:32:32,397
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, in the past, as I've understood it, both as an audience member and a school committee member, there was a portion that was labeled, you know, public participation or whatever it was called in the past, and now we wanna call it public comment, which makes sense, and then presentation for the other one, or whatever we end up deciding, but to differentiate between the two.

870
01:32:33,135 --> 01:32:47,404
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and, and having something, I really do like the chair's statement about, you know, are there questions on this topic, but, and I think being a little bit more explicit about what public participation is, is our comment is, is really important.

871
01:32:47,985 --> 01:32:51,347
[SPEAKER_04]: But in the past we had both, it wasn't either, or it was both and.

872
01:32:51,647 --> 01:33:02,509
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there was a section where, and I really liked the idea, the purpose that I'm trying to get to is what the superintendent is talking about as well, is having this at the top of the meeting so that people aren't sitting.

873
01:33:02,829 --> 01:33:08,150
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there were plenty of nights when I was in that audience where I would be there till right with you guys, till 1130 or midnight.

874
01:33:08,310 --> 01:33:12,571
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was a long time for a parent to wait to talk about something.

875
01:33:12,611 --> 01:33:17,852
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think having it at the forefront is really important and having that designated time

876
01:33:18,349 --> 01:33:38,361
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like we've had in the past but frankly we've also had that, you know, if there was also an item that was of importance to an individual, you could, you know, approach the podium with three minutes of time I mean that was sort of the way it was historically so what I'm understanding you guys saying is that the things that are on the table here either.

877
01:33:39,882 --> 01:33:54,452
[SPEAKER_04]: do a block at the open and a block at the end to give people a block on either end, or at every single item, do that, or do what we're talking about, what we've done in the past was the public comment section.

878
01:33:55,153 --> 01:34:02,618
[SPEAKER_04]: And if there's a particular item that someone feels strongly about on the agenda, they have three minutes or something to come up and talk about it.

879
01:34:02,678 --> 01:34:06,100
[SPEAKER_04]: So are those the three things that we're talking about on the table right now?

880
01:34:07,320 --> 01:34:15,546
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't see them as three things we have always allowed members of the public to come up and speak on every single item all night long.

881
01:34:17,247 --> 01:34:22,551
[SPEAKER_11]: We've never had a block at the end where people can come up and, you know, do a city council thing where.

882
01:34:23,012 --> 01:34:28,296
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, we're opening up the floor, everybody come and talk about what you want, whether it was on the agenda or not.

883
01:34:29,236 --> 01:34:30,397
[SPEAKER_11]: We've never had that.

884
01:34:30,837 --> 01:34:31,658
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't, I don't.

885
01:34:32,512 --> 01:34:41,537
[SPEAKER_04]: point of information, though, Member Russo, we did have, there was a block that was public participation or public whatever, historically.

886
01:34:42,498 --> 01:34:44,759
[SPEAKER_11]: You could also- Sorry.

887
01:34:45,800 --> 01:34:50,563
[SPEAKER_11]: I brought the agenda up, and we have item number seven, community participation.

888
01:34:50,843 --> 01:34:56,166
[SPEAKER_11]: And then it says, any citizen in the audience may be given permission to speak once for three minutes.

889
01:34:56,806 --> 01:34:59,628
[SPEAKER_11]: And then it continues on and says, again,

890
01:35:00,244 --> 01:35:03,606
[SPEAKER_11]: This is where we've labeled the two different things with the exact same words.

891
01:35:03,626 --> 01:35:11,410
[SPEAKER_11]: Then it says community participation portion of the agenda will be established to give any citizens to do the presentation thing.

892
01:35:12,211 --> 01:35:19,394
[SPEAKER_11]: And then, so there is not, I've never seen it where we say this or the mayor reads this.

893
01:35:20,655 --> 01:35:26,178
[SPEAKER_11]: If there's a presentation like the dyslexia presentation, the most recent one I can think of, it's literally on the agenda here.

894
01:35:27,645 --> 01:35:33,768
[SPEAKER_11]: But when this is read, I've never seen our meetings where people just get up and start talking, but that's not what happens.

895
01:35:33,888 --> 01:35:36,329
[SPEAKER_11]: They wait for the item on the agenda to come up.

896
01:35:36,849 --> 01:35:48,234
[SPEAKER_11]: So all we're doing here is saying early, you know, which by the way, if we read this at six o'clock and somebody knows it's way in the, so at eight o'clock, they joined the meeting because it's a long agenda.

897
01:35:48,735 --> 01:35:49,655
[SPEAKER_11]: They didn't hear this.

898
01:35:51,876 --> 01:35:55,798
[SPEAKER_11]: And then those in the know, know that they can speak

899
01:35:56,701 --> 01:35:58,622
[SPEAKER_11]: for three minutes on any item on the agenda.

900
01:35:58,762 --> 01:36:03,144
[SPEAKER_11]: And those that don't end up like Monday at the end of the meeting, wondering, well, what happened?

901
01:36:03,704 --> 01:36:05,825
[SPEAKER_11]: Nobody asked us when we wanted to talk.

902
01:36:06,245 --> 01:36:20,912
[SPEAKER_11]: So I see it as the splitting it up into presentations of the public, which was that presentation section, putting that at the top of the hour, which it already is very near to the top now.

903
01:36:21,813 --> 01:36:23,614
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just after approval of minutes and bills.

904
01:36:25,060 --> 01:36:28,901
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's not really a particularly interesting change in my mind.

905
01:36:29,401 --> 01:36:49,708
[SPEAKER_11]: And then with the big difference here in the language I have here is that superintendent would do all the presentations, which here on Monday, there were 10 of them, I take it back, where we approve accepting a donation or we hear from the CCSR, et cetera.

906
01:36:49,728 --> 01:36:50,928
[SPEAKER_11]: I won't go through Monday's meeting.

907
01:36:51,487 --> 01:36:55,611
[SPEAKER_11]: But like all of those things on Monday, we did not have public participation.

908
01:36:55,771 --> 01:37:00,016
[SPEAKER_11]: And I never sensed that any of us expected there was public participation on those items.

909
01:37:01,417 --> 01:37:04,740
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe I'm wrong, but that's not how it's been.

910
01:37:05,963 --> 01:37:12,027
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's not how it's been, but technically you could and that's how that was what the policy was and that was what the understanding was.

911
01:37:12,087 --> 01:37:21,493
[SPEAKER_04]: So I remember clarifying this very, you know, very explicitly when I was actively engaged as an audience member because I wanted to understand the difference between

912
01:37:21,886 --> 01:37:26,328
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, doing a presentation as a CPAC presentation or wanting to comment on an agenda item.

913
01:37:26,408 --> 01:37:37,252
[SPEAKER_04]: And the misunderstanding that I had that I needed to be able to let somebody know 48 hours in advance or 72 hours in advance or whatever, if I wanted to comment even on an agenda item, right?

914
01:37:37,772 --> 01:37:39,072
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's not the case at all.

915
01:37:39,132 --> 01:37:42,073
[SPEAKER_04]: People can comment on the fly in the audience with three minutes.

916
01:37:42,133 --> 01:37:48,956
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that that's on any agenda item, frankly, or that's how it, you know, that was what the understanding was that I had been given by

917
01:37:49,436 --> 01:37:51,497
[SPEAKER_04]: school committee members and by the former superintendent.

918
01:37:51,537 --> 01:37:56,438
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm asking is that if that's not what we're suggesting, how are we being explicit in that?

919
01:37:56,578 --> 01:38:02,219
[SPEAKER_04]: And if it is what we're suggesting, is it both and or either or with these public petition patient pieces?

920
01:38:02,319 --> 01:38:11,182
[SPEAKER_04]: And then what I hear you suggesting is this statement, or I think I hear you suggesting is this statement being read not on the reports obviously, but on any of the other.

921
01:38:12,442 --> 01:38:14,644
[SPEAKER_04]: items and frankly I want to just add for the reports.

922
01:38:15,065 --> 01:38:28,597
[SPEAKER_04]: I disagree there could be somebody that wants to comment on a report or report if there's a report that comes up and it's a, for example, the dyslexia report that was given, I think a year and a half ago by administration, you know there was a parent there that did want to get up and comment on, you know, whatever the

923
01:38:29,557 --> 01:38:33,778
[SPEAKER_04]: the difference of opinion in either the scientific evidence of the report or what have you.

924
01:38:33,818 --> 01:38:37,358
[SPEAKER_04]: So there are instances where people will wanna comment on the report.

925
01:38:37,438 --> 01:38:45,100
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, I'm not sure I know what I'm thinking the solution is, but I just wanna point out what I see the issues are.

926
01:38:45,340 --> 01:38:45,720
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

927
01:38:45,900 --> 01:38:48,160
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a member of the community that has their hand raised.

928
01:38:48,200 --> 01:38:48,700
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Russo.

929
01:38:49,381 --> 01:38:49,641
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

930
01:38:49,961 --> 01:38:51,481
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanna respond to that and then I'll go to Ms.

931
01:38:51,521 --> 01:38:53,921
[SPEAKER_11]: Brown, to Eunice.

932
01:38:54,401 --> 01:38:57,162
[SPEAKER_11]: One of our responsibilities, and I'm not, sounds a bit,

933
01:38:57,647 --> 01:39:10,216
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't mean this to sound quite the way it's coming out, but a huge portion of our job is monitoring, is accepting reports that the legislature or DESE said we have to receive and the superintendent has to give us.

934
01:39:11,277 --> 01:39:12,578
[SPEAKER_11]: We're not making decisions.

935
01:39:12,598 --> 01:39:14,299
[SPEAKER_11]: We have to accept this $350,000 grant.

936
01:39:14,319 --> 01:39:15,399
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, that's not a choice.

937
01:39:23,648 --> 01:39:30,253
[SPEAKER_11]: For me, everything under the report of the superintendent is a superintendent's way of talking to us and the public.

938
01:39:30,954 --> 01:39:44,965
[SPEAKER_11]: And if somebody in the public wants to get up to talk about that item, my understanding of how that would work, and I have language for that later, is, well, there are seven school committee members.

939
01:39:45,005 --> 01:39:48,808
[SPEAKER_11]: We can all put a motion anytime we want on the agenda.

940
01:39:50,278 --> 01:39:56,163
[SPEAKER_11]: I just don't think it's fair to the administration to anybody who's standing there giving a presentation.

941
01:39:56,643 --> 01:39:58,264
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, we had the CPAC report.

942
01:39:59,185 --> 01:40:11,415
[SPEAKER_11]: So it would have been fair to allow anybody in the public who has a bone to pick with the report or how much we spend on special education to come up and start like a full-blown dialogue with that person who's doing the report.

943
01:40:11,595 --> 01:40:18,441
[SPEAKER_11]: And like, that is not what I think of as an appropriate public participation

944
01:40:19,945 --> 01:40:21,245
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not fair to the presenter.

945
01:40:21,305 --> 01:40:25,008
[SPEAKER_11]: It's certainly not fair to the administration who was unprepared for that to happen.

946
01:40:25,708 --> 01:40:30,571
[SPEAKER_11]: And as members, we don't have any ability to prepare for that.

947
01:40:30,691 --> 01:40:47,662
[SPEAKER_11]: Like I come to the meetings prepared for the items on the new business and continued business or old business with having read and if I didn't understand something, asking questions like, but these presentations are, most of them are frankly, you know, mandatory or

948
01:40:48,585 --> 01:40:50,726
[SPEAKER_11]: And they're for our consumption.

949
01:40:50,966 --> 01:40:54,607
[SPEAKER_11]: And if we wanna make a new policy about something, we can do that.

950
01:40:56,127 --> 01:41:05,290
[SPEAKER_11]: But I just don't know why the, and as the superintendent said, I mean, we already have meetings that are three times longer than most school committees.

951
01:41:05,450 --> 01:41:06,790
[SPEAKER_11]: It's embarrassing at this point.

952
01:41:07,770 --> 01:41:12,112
[SPEAKER_11]: If we're going to open every item up for public comment and dialogue,

953
01:41:15,803 --> 01:41:22,506
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, but who, what's the, we're going to not accept the $350,000 grant because of public comment.

954
01:41:23,866 --> 01:41:29,769
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just don't know that I think unbounded public comment.

955
01:41:29,969 --> 01:41:34,470
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it just, we're already out of control.

956
01:41:35,011 --> 01:41:35,971
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think

957
01:41:36,835 --> 01:41:38,016
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, it's not fair to staff.

958
01:41:38,316 --> 01:41:49,622
[SPEAKER_11]: And frankly, if I was looking for a job in a school district, and you told me I had to attend every school committee meeting, and I had to choose between one that was an hour and a half, twice a month, and one that was seven hours, twice a month.

959
01:41:50,205 --> 01:41:51,825
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd be like, thanks.

960
01:41:52,786 --> 01:41:54,446
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I just make a clarification member?

961
01:41:54,526 --> 01:42:03,868
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm not suggesting that I want longer meetings and I'm definitely not suggesting that I want, you know, a public comment on every single item.

962
01:42:04,068 --> 01:42:14,191
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm suggesting that I'm seeing a couple of different issues or questions raised and I'm asking what is it that is being proposed to us as,

963
01:42:17,272 --> 01:42:24,254
[SPEAKER_04]: and equity subcommittee to bring forward to the school committee, because frankly, I'm not clear on that right now.

964
01:42:25,675 --> 01:42:26,495
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

965
01:42:26,755 --> 01:42:38,599
[SPEAKER_11]: The proposal is after the report of the superintendent, which is in the current, in the last meeting, all of this, the mayor will then read a statement about public comment.

966
01:42:40,720 --> 01:42:43,801
[SPEAKER_11]: The one we just reviewed actually in the previous policy.

967
01:42:44,798 --> 01:42:46,239
[SPEAKER_11]: So this isn't quite exactly correct.

968
01:42:46,699 --> 01:42:51,042
[SPEAKER_11]: And then after that, there won't be a public comment period.

969
01:42:51,603 --> 01:42:54,024
[SPEAKER_11]: There would be, we would move on with the agenda.

970
01:42:54,064 --> 01:43:00,429
[SPEAKER_11]: The mayor will say this, meaning from this point on public comment is an option, is essentially what that means.

971
01:43:01,249 --> 01:43:02,890
[SPEAKER_11]: And perhaps I should say that.

972
01:43:03,811 --> 01:43:09,555
[SPEAKER_11]: Then we would have report of committees, continued slash old business, new business,

973
01:43:11,039 --> 01:43:16,640
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we've moved these boring things down here where we're gonna vote for minutes and stuff.

974
01:43:17,120 --> 01:43:34,824
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I mean, these, I mean, report committees also does not, I don't recall any interaction with the public ever on a report of committees, but the continued business and new business is the meat, that's the policymaking, that's our job.

975
01:43:34,904 --> 01:43:39,545
[SPEAKER_11]: And so those are the only two sections I envision the mayor saying the words

976
01:43:40,832 --> 01:43:45,636
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, um, you know, um, are there any members of the public who wish to speak on this item?

977
01:43:45,716 --> 01:43:50,399
[SPEAKER_11]: So it would have been, you know, the mayor made the motion to extend the advisory committee a week.

978
01:43:52,781 --> 01:43:53,502
[SPEAKER_11]: That gets asked.

979
01:43:54,763 --> 01:43:59,126
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, and on Monday, frankly, I think some members of the public would have stood up then.

980
01:43:59,726 --> 01:44:05,271
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, then we talk and we vote and then number two, three, four, and

981
01:44:07,423 --> 01:44:08,544
[SPEAKER_11]: we didn't have an old business.

982
01:44:08,884 --> 01:44:09,744
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember Russo?

983
01:44:10,365 --> 01:44:10,685
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

984
01:44:11,165 --> 01:44:19,269
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm not sure that that addresses the issue of not having, it doesn't address the issue of not having people wait the entire evening to be able to offer public communication.

985
01:44:19,329 --> 01:44:24,612
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess I'm just asking, is there a reason that we couldn't do new business before reports?

986
01:44:28,533 --> 01:44:33,596
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, reports in the new format should be, you mean the superintendent's update?

987
01:44:34,636 --> 01:44:35,737
[SPEAKER_11]: Report of the superintendent, sorry.

988
01:44:37,315 --> 01:44:46,220
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we could do report of the superintendent new business and then any other, you know, district-based reports, but that's just, I'm just saying, how do we alleviate the issue?

989
01:44:46,240 --> 01:44:47,301
[SPEAKER_11]: This is all, sorry.

990
01:44:48,021 --> 01:44:49,802
[SPEAKER_11]: This is all report of the superintendent.

991
01:44:51,163 --> 01:44:53,544
[SPEAKER_11]: All 10 of these things are the report of the superintendent.

992
01:44:58,507 --> 01:45:00,789
[SPEAKER_04]: I never saw that as report of the superintendent.

993
01:45:00,809 --> 01:45:04,151
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess I see the report of the superintendent as the superintendent's update.

994
01:45:05,051 --> 01:45:06,352
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's all of them.

995
01:45:07,763 --> 01:45:09,745
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's the whole section.

996
01:45:10,586 --> 01:45:13,828
[SPEAKER_07]: Currently, for last week, it was section eight.

997
01:45:14,869 --> 01:45:22,136
[SPEAKER_04]: So how do we address the issue of the public not having to wait till the end to comment?

998
01:45:22,356 --> 01:45:28,001
[SPEAKER_02]: In the spirit of not making the public wait till the end to comment, can we hear from Eunice who has had her hand in the air?

999
01:45:28,021 --> 01:45:29,202
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I would like to hear from Eunice.

1000
01:45:29,743 --> 01:45:30,243
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1001
01:45:30,263 --> 01:45:32,365
[SPEAKER_11]: Eunice, let me unmute you.

1002
01:45:34,750 --> 01:45:35,390
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1003
01:45:36,191 --> 01:45:38,052
[SPEAKER_11]: Name and street address, please.

1004
01:45:38,433 --> 01:45:38,693
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

1005
01:45:39,093 --> 01:45:41,174
[SPEAKER_06]: Eunice Brown, 48 Greenleaf Ave, Medford.

1006
01:45:42,555 --> 01:45:43,916
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much for letting me speak.

1007
01:45:43,976 --> 01:45:48,239
[SPEAKER_06]: And Paul, thank you for your thoughtful back and forth earlier this week.

1008
01:45:48,259 --> 01:45:48,880
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate it.

1009
01:45:49,940 --> 01:45:51,261
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot to say here.

1010
01:45:51,281 --> 01:45:56,305
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess I'll start off with I watch a lot of the school committee.

1011
01:45:56,325 --> 01:46:02,749
[SPEAKER_06]: I watch even more of the city council and how they do things, just for clarity.

1012
01:46:04,828 --> 01:46:10,774
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, they start out in their agenda and then they, you know, get to their agenda items, whatever they may be.

1013
01:46:11,795 --> 01:46:21,284
[SPEAKER_06]: And generally, you know, they'll have a presentation of potholes, let's say, and, you know, pothole repair.

1014
01:46:21,304 --> 01:46:21,364
[SPEAKER_06]: And

1015
01:46:23,222 --> 01:46:37,385
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, somebody will present, or if there isn't a presentation, you know, one of the council members will talk about pothole repair, and then the public will be allowed to speak before they vote on anything.

1016
01:46:37,465 --> 01:46:41,586
[SPEAKER_06]: So Paul, I know you were saying, you know, so do we vote and then the public speaks?

1017
01:46:42,306 --> 01:46:51,128
[SPEAKER_06]: The way it works there is that, you know, they discuss, the public says what they need to say, and then they vote.

1018
01:46:51,688 --> 01:46:52,348
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's how,

1019
01:46:53,053 --> 01:47:06,363
[SPEAKER_06]: I would suggest that the school committee do things because your vote may, what the public says may or may not impact how you choose to vote.

1020
01:47:07,119 --> 01:47:27,724
[SPEAKER_06]: on a particular option, you know, I think, and then, so the public can speak after, you know, each agenda item and then, you know, the item gets voted on or it gets received and placed on file or whatever the proper dispensation of it is.

1021
01:47:28,424 --> 01:47:31,444
[SPEAKER_06]: And then yes, they do public participation at the end.

1022
01:47:32,685 --> 01:47:34,245
[SPEAKER_06]: And that is when the public can,

1023
01:47:35,079 --> 01:47:37,620
[SPEAKER_06]: get up and talk about whatever they want to talk about.

1024
01:47:37,660 --> 01:47:42,603
[SPEAKER_06]: They can talk about tree trimming if they want, even though it wasn't on the agenda.

1025
01:47:43,363 --> 01:47:46,985
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's how they do things.

1026
01:47:47,085 --> 01:47:50,186
[SPEAKER_06]: I would suggest that you do something similar.

1027
01:47:50,346 --> 01:47:59,891
[SPEAKER_06]: And I liked member McLaughlin's suggestion because yes, your meetings do run long and the public is sitting on Zoom or in there or whatever.

1028
01:48:01,107 --> 01:48:08,836
[SPEAKER_06]: what's wrong with moving the new business, old business, new business part, which as you say, is the meat and potatoes of the meeting.

1029
01:48:09,718 --> 01:48:17,407
[SPEAKER_06]: What's wrong with moving that to earlier in the meeting before the report of superintendent and let, you know,

1030
01:48:18,333 --> 01:48:25,796
[SPEAKER_06]: That's where, you know, those items is where the public generally has the most to say.

1031
01:48:26,477 --> 01:48:38,162
[SPEAKER_06]: They may want to talk about a report, you know, as a couple of you have noted, but the lion's share of public comment comes under each agenda item.

1032
01:48:38,302 --> 01:48:42,163
[SPEAKER_06]: So why not move that piece to earlier in the meeting?

1033
01:48:44,412 --> 01:48:57,599
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, maybe your presentations of the public, that would be maybe where your dyslexia presentation could go, but the lion's share of public comment comes with your resolutions and so forth.

1034
01:48:57,639 --> 01:49:12,647
[SPEAKER_06]: So move all of that up and then do the report of the superintendent and those 10 items like there were the other night to, you know, a little bit further down so that the public isn't sitting all night

1035
01:49:13,780 --> 01:49:41,385
[SPEAKER_06]: and then in regards to the meetings going so long, and maybe this is mandated by DESE or whatever, but when you know that you have a controversial item on the agenda, and I know it's sometimes hard to predict, but when you know that you're going to have an item on the agenda that's going to generate a lot of public participation,

1036
01:49:42,087 --> 01:49:52,994
[SPEAKER_06]: and in an effort to keep you guys from going home before midnight, you know, do you have to have five reports, presentations of reports on an agenda?

1037
01:49:53,535 --> 01:49:57,978
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, maybe do two this week, two next week, two the week after.

1038
01:49:57,998 --> 01:50:11,407
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if maybe, you know, does he mandate certain things certain ways, but instead of having five reports on, you know, one agenda and a controversial or, you know, topic that's going to generate

1039
01:50:12,227 --> 01:50:35,886
[SPEAKER_06]: lot of public participation, you know, and if you even if you're limiting things to three minutes, you know, if you have, you know, 15 people or 20 people who are speaking for something, you know, and 20 people speaking against something, you know, you're, you know, that's still more than an hour's worth of public participation that, you know, you should be listening to.

1040
01:50:35,907 --> 01:50:36,467
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know,

1041
01:50:39,005 --> 01:50:43,246
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that a possibility to do?

1042
01:50:43,786 --> 01:50:51,108
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would suggest making it clear that people can speak after each agenda item.

1043
01:50:51,428 --> 01:51:02,871
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that was where things fell apart the other night is that they had no, and I've communicated with some people, they had no idea that they were able to

1044
01:51:03,651 --> 01:51:13,173
[SPEAKER_06]: To talk after, you know, the agenda item, you know, and maybe that was a product of, you know, being in the room for the first time in 15 months or something like that.

1045
01:51:13,273 --> 01:51:14,874
[SPEAKER_06]: I really am not sure.

1046
01:51:15,314 --> 01:51:25,877
[SPEAKER_06]: They thought that the community participation part early on was to discuss how the process of community participation was going to go.

1047
01:51:25,897 --> 01:51:28,217
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems that they sort of missed the boat on that one.

1048
01:51:28,237 --> 01:51:29,698
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know,

1049
01:51:31,308 --> 01:51:43,115
[SPEAKER_06]: those would be my suggestions, move the new business, old business to the front and make it very clear that people can speak after each item.

1050
01:51:43,355 --> 01:51:54,200
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you vote after you've heard from the public, because maybe somebody will say something, maybe you were leaning one way on a topic.

1051
01:51:55,041 --> 01:51:58,463
[SPEAKER_06]: And when 15 people say, no, do this,

1052
01:51:59,477 --> 01:52:00,477
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe you'll change your vote.

1053
01:52:00,637 --> 01:52:04,379
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe you won't, you know, but who knows?

1054
01:52:04,819 --> 01:52:11,682
[SPEAKER_06]: So those were, let me see if I've covered everything that I was thinking about.

1055
01:52:11,742 --> 01:52:13,082
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep, that basically does it.

1056
01:52:13,142 --> 01:52:13,803
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

1057
01:52:15,103 --> 01:52:15,503
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1058
01:52:15,523 --> 01:52:22,786
[SPEAKER_11]: I just will, I just wanna, you know, the difference between the school committee and city council is stark.

1059
01:52:28,558 --> 01:52:31,720
[SPEAKER_11]: this is our list of the annual reports that we must receive and vote on.

1060
01:52:32,900 --> 01:52:43,246
[SPEAKER_11]: This list, I don't know what the list is for the city council, but we had 10 on the agenda on Monday, and that's not unusual for every single meeting.

1061
01:52:45,086 --> 01:52:55,372
[SPEAKER_11]: We have so many, I mean, if we received 15 different donations this week from members of the public, we will have 15 items to vote on, and

1062
01:52:57,335 --> 01:53:01,678
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I don't know that it's fair to compare us in any way, shape or form to city council.

1063
01:53:01,698 --> 01:53:12,765
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, the format, it's a perfectly valid conversation, but our responsibilities and the city council's responsibilities are worlds apart, frankly.

1064
01:53:13,506 --> 01:53:21,771
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, the city council doesn't have, you know, a dozen staff members who have to be back at seven o'clock in the morning

1065
01:53:22,971 --> 01:53:26,013
[SPEAKER_11]: that are required to be at our meeting to do their presentations.

1066
01:53:26,414 --> 01:53:35,781
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm, you know, it is a problem that I don't think there is no beautiful solution.

1067
01:53:36,621 --> 01:53:47,610
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we have all of our staff wait till the end of the night and start giving their presentation starting at eight o'clock so that they can get out at 10 or 11 and then drive home?

1068
01:53:47,930 --> 01:53:51,313
[SPEAKER_11]: Many of them don't even live in Medford to be back at 7 a.m.

1069
01:53:52,890 --> 01:53:55,091
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we do that every night or, sorry?

1070
01:53:55,552 --> 01:53:57,934
[SPEAKER_06]: Or do you have the public waiting until nine, 10 o'clock at night?

1071
01:53:58,715 --> 01:54:04,400
[SPEAKER_11]: Right, the public who all definitely lives here and has chosen to be here versus has to be here.

1072
01:54:05,541 --> 01:54:13,267
[SPEAKER_11]: And also the public has the option to provide, you know, all the school committee members, like we have email addresses.

1073
01:54:13,728 --> 01:54:19,152
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel like we get communicated to, at least I do, you know, 50 times a week or more.

1074
01:54:20,257 --> 01:54:22,418
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's not that this is the only opportunity.

1075
01:54:22,558 --> 01:54:31,881
[SPEAKER_11]: Unfortunately, for the director of special education to give her annual audit report, there are no alternatives for her.

1076
01:54:31,941 --> 01:54:32,782
[SPEAKER_11]: She can't mail it in.

1077
01:54:34,502 --> 01:54:46,827
[SPEAKER_11]: And so if I have to choose between the public having to wait till the end of the night or all the staff, and frankly, I really, this is a employer's market.

1078
01:54:46,847 --> 01:54:49,328
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry, an employee's market.

1079
01:54:50,677 --> 01:55:01,840
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, we keep doing seven hour meetings and I am quite concerned about staff turnover when there are countless opportunities for all of our staff.

1080
01:55:02,960 --> 01:55:14,522
[SPEAKER_11]: So keeping the district operational is a more important thing than keeping the public, allowing the public to feel like they are being heard at every opportunity.

1081
01:55:14,562 --> 01:55:16,903
[SPEAKER_11]: Because our job does not include

1082
01:55:17,643 --> 01:55:21,648
[SPEAKER_11]: public participation and comment that is actually not part of our job description.

1083
01:55:22,108 --> 01:55:28,716
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's important as an elected official, but it is definitely not the job of the school committee to hear the public.

1084
01:55:29,337 --> 01:55:31,880
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Graham, I hope I got that in the right order.

1085
01:55:33,949 --> 01:55:41,011
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had a couple of thoughts and sort of simultaneous with all of this, right?

1086
01:55:41,111 --> 01:55:45,752
[SPEAKER_02]: We are being asked by the public to meet much, much later than we have been meeting.

1087
01:55:45,772 --> 01:55:51,173
[SPEAKER_02]: And I understand why the public would want that.

1088
01:55:51,393 --> 01:56:00,495
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, that puts sort of stress and pressure on our employees when the lion's share of the meeting is often being covered by,

1089
01:56:02,314 --> 01:56:06,616
[SPEAKER_02]: the employees of the district and handling all of this mandatory work.

1090
01:56:07,336 --> 01:56:29,325
[SPEAKER_02]: So I feel like I am coming around to the notion that we would start early, we would cover all, we would cover our executive sessions first, which I actually think is prudent, given that those conversations are highly sensitive and having them at 10 or 11 o'clock at night is never

1091
01:56:31,380 --> 01:56:34,543
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be our best work as the superintendent mentions.

1092
01:56:35,344 --> 01:56:46,958
[SPEAKER_02]: We then do all of the superintendent's reports and we make a commitment to the public that the public presentations and new business will not start before 7 p.m.

1093
01:56:48,720 --> 01:56:54,986
[SPEAKER_02]: We then allow public presentations, if there are any, that have been requested in advance.

1094
01:56:55,667 --> 01:56:57,288
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we talk about our new business.

1095
01:56:57,449 --> 01:57:09,641
[SPEAKER_02]: And before new business, the chair of the school committee, whether that's the mayor or somebody standing in, the vice chair, talks about, for each new business item, we're going to read it.

1096
01:57:13,068 --> 01:57:18,252
[SPEAKER_02]: who has submitted the new business is going to provide their description on it.

1097
01:57:18,732 --> 01:57:24,077
[SPEAKER_02]: We are gonna ask if there's members of the public that need to speak, then we will deliberate and vote.

1098
01:57:24,857 --> 01:57:38,428
[SPEAKER_02]: And that way we can continue starting our meetings earlier, which I feel like is good for everybody, but that we make a commitment that the public,

1099
01:57:40,554 --> 01:57:50,582
[SPEAKER_02]: participation part in any resolutions being entered by the school committee, which are really like our new business, or really the full of the agenda of the city council will not start until 7 p.m.

1100
01:57:51,163 --> 01:57:53,585
[SPEAKER_02]: And that way we have an option.

1101
01:57:55,226 --> 01:57:59,910
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, Member Graham, when you're saying public participation, are you referring to public comment?

1102
01:58:00,751 --> 01:58:03,453
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm referring to presentations of the public.

1103
01:58:03,974 --> 01:58:08,978
[SPEAKER_02]: So number three moves down, and new business comes after that.

1104
01:58:10,618 --> 01:58:19,526
[SPEAKER_02]: so that we're doing a little, we're sort of trying to satisfy a lot of different interests at the same time.

1105
01:58:24,350 --> 01:58:26,671
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think, you know, we have to,

1106
01:58:28,257 --> 01:58:44,307
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we have to acknowledge that if we, if we allow the superintendent's report to go first, the members of her staff that are there to present on one item then have an option to go home and they might actually be able to get home before seven o'clock.

1107
01:58:46,255 --> 01:58:56,839
[SPEAKER_02]: And that the policy making part of our job, which is really what effectively new business is right and is like most aligned with the city council that starts at seven.

1108
01:58:57,540 --> 01:59:04,602
[SPEAKER_02]: So that or no earlier than seven, so that the public knows when they can show up and participate.

1109
01:59:06,463 --> 01:59:14,849
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm making a presumption that people can continue to hear from the superintendent remotely and via Zoom, and that that option will continue.

1110
01:59:16,530 --> 01:59:35,084
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that could allow us to meet earlier, but be clear about where the public participation component is, and maybe aim at slightly more efficient meetings than we've been able to have in the past.

1111
01:59:37,278 --> 01:59:46,041
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Graham, before I call on Member McLaughlin, I'm just, you know, the new language of we're calling these different sections is garbling me.

1112
01:59:46,981 --> 01:59:54,784
[SPEAKER_11]: What you're seeing on screen is that... I would put report of subcommittees.

1113
01:59:56,410 --> 02:00:06,553
[SPEAKER_02]: up above the report of the superintendent because to me, like basically what we had talked about in the last meeting was putting all of our stuff at the back so that we weren't keeping the public all night.

1114
02:00:06,613 --> 02:00:09,394
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I'm suggesting is the meetings start earlier.

1115
02:00:09,414 --> 02:00:19,737
[SPEAKER_02]: So we push all that stuff back to the front so that seven o'clock becomes like sort of a reasonable time to think that we would be getting to the more public oriented components.

1116
02:00:22,417 --> 02:00:26,120
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, correct, and then new business would come after that.

1117
02:00:30,302 --> 02:00:33,724
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, so new business would be number six.

1118
02:00:34,605 --> 02:00:36,526
[SPEAKER_11]: Number six would be new business.

1119
02:00:36,826 --> 02:00:39,468
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would put it right above pursuant to the policy.

1120
02:00:39,488 --> 02:00:43,010
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, continued business should come before new business.

1121
02:00:43,550 --> 02:00:48,213
[SPEAKER_11]: And that may just be the equivalent of new business that we said, it's too late, let's do it next week.

1122
02:00:48,233 --> 02:00:50,615
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think those two really should be together.

1123
02:00:52,646 --> 02:01:03,029
[SPEAKER_11]: And then so what I dislike is that this text that will float on the agenda that's not an item, it looks weird here.

1124
02:01:03,049 --> 02:01:08,931
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it will look normal once you play out the actual agenda and create one.

1125
02:01:09,631 --> 02:01:11,072
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the policy of the agenda.

1126
02:01:11,092 --> 02:01:14,853
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's a little wonky, maybe an extra space.

1127
02:01:17,485 --> 02:01:22,949
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think there should just be something really clear that says this section of the agenda will not begin before 7 p.m.

1128
02:01:24,190 --> 02:01:30,054
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, and actually a lot of agendas do try to guess time, a lot of them.

1129
02:01:30,754 --> 02:01:34,617
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we're not ready for that yet.

1130
02:01:35,177 --> 02:01:37,799
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the consent agenda would also go up to the top.

1131
02:01:45,906 --> 02:01:49,749
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, right, and we'll just move the consent agenda to the top since we now have that rub.

1132
02:01:49,949 --> 02:02:02,177
[SPEAKER_11]: Correct.

1133
02:02:03,217 --> 02:02:05,499
[SPEAKER_11]: We can just do consent agenda right there, actually.

1134
02:02:05,899 --> 02:02:06,119
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

1135
02:02:07,360 --> 02:02:08,241
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1136
02:02:11,843 --> 02:02:14,825
[SPEAKER_11]: I should just make myself an editor instead of making suggestions, but

1137
02:02:15,857 --> 02:02:19,619
[SPEAKER_11]: because it's agenda report of the superintendent.

1138
02:02:20,340 --> 02:02:34,108
[SPEAKER_11]: So these first four items, well, the first three items, well, the first three items though, could be literally, you know, three minutes total.

1139
02:02:35,369 --> 02:02:42,493
[SPEAKER_11]: The report of the committees is sort of the, you know, sort of the one where some of us talk a long time, some of us don't, and sometimes there are none.

1140
02:02:43,956 --> 02:02:45,517
[SPEAKER_11]: typically it's less than 15 minutes.

1141
02:02:46,178 --> 02:02:53,183
[SPEAKER_11]: Then we can get to all those reports and then presentations of the public not to begin before 7 p.m.

1142
02:02:53,203 --> 02:03:00,469
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I mean, worst case scenario, we have to take a 10 minute break while we all scarf down some food.

1143
02:03:01,010 --> 02:03:03,732
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's not the worst thing that could happen.

1144
02:03:04,032 --> 02:03:12,959
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually like this because it does reduce, it sort of satisfies the needs of the staff

1145
02:03:14,529 --> 02:03:20,212
[SPEAKER_11]: and the public in making it so they're not waiting longer while all those other presentations come in.

1146
02:03:20,952 --> 02:03:38,400
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, I just also want to state like the members, I hear from a lot of people, I know that other members hear from a lot of people, you know, if there's anything that has happened on the agenda or that you want us to make a motion on, I don't,

1147
02:03:38,941 --> 02:03:44,703
[SPEAKER_11]: know that that's really, I know city council, it's sort of a practice that, you know, you want to put something on the agenda.

1148
02:03:44,723 --> 02:03:48,624
[SPEAKER_11]: I think city councilor has to sponsor it or something like that.

1149
02:03:48,684 --> 02:03:49,564
[SPEAKER_11]: I forget the right word.

1150
02:03:50,545 --> 02:03:56,506
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, we don't have that as an explicit policy, but obviously that would be totally doable.

1151
02:03:57,247 --> 02:03:58,587
[SPEAKER_11]: Member McLaughlin.

1152
02:04:01,628 --> 02:04:02,348
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, thank you.

1153
02:04:02,488 --> 02:04:02,708
[SPEAKER_04]: So,

1154
02:04:06,197 --> 02:04:14,802
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to say that I think under the top public present, can you go back up to the top, the presentations of the public.

1155
02:04:15,323 --> 02:04:28,671
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think, again, you need to have a clear, you know, definition of a presentation like a under six, I would do a presentation and it can say constituent presentation, you know, individual presentation, whatever.

1156
02:04:29,084 --> 02:04:31,385
[SPEAKER_04]: and B, public comment, right?

1157
02:04:31,485 --> 02:04:34,086
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is an opportunity and maybe we define what those are.

1158
02:04:34,186 --> 02:04:40,408
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know that we've been talking about definitions for all of these other glossaries for all of these other things.

1159
02:04:40,468 --> 02:04:53,613
[SPEAKER_04]: I think these items need to be added to our glossary that's gonna be on the website, our sort of master glossary that we've been talking about so that people do understand what these are and what the differentiation between them are.

1160
02:04:56,003 --> 02:05:07,014
[SPEAKER_04]: So there was that and then I did just want to add, I want to make sure because I know you remember Rousseau and I know that you spend a lot of time getting emails from people and talking to people on the phone and.

1161
02:05:07,458 --> 02:05:09,359
[SPEAKER_04]: doing any number of those things.

1162
02:05:09,459 --> 02:05:17,721
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't want it taken out of context when you were saying earlier that public participation or public feedback is not really our job.

1163
02:05:18,342 --> 02:05:19,182
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't feel that way.

1164
02:05:19,522 --> 02:05:20,662
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like it is our job.

1165
02:05:20,842 --> 02:05:24,204
[SPEAKER_04]: And certainly we respond to that and we listen to that.

1166
02:05:24,224 --> 02:05:26,925
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why we're spending so much time coordinating this.

1167
02:05:27,345 --> 02:05:37,268
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just wanna make sure that people are clear that that's not, or maybe, I don't wanna put words in your mouth, but I think that you do value that.

1168
02:05:39,393 --> 02:05:39,753
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1169
02:05:40,333 --> 02:05:41,554
[SPEAKER_11]: I obviously do value that.

1170
02:05:41,594 --> 02:05:49,315
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that sometimes I do say things that can be taken out of context too easily.

1171
02:05:49,695 --> 02:05:58,978
[SPEAKER_11]: I think as individual members and as elected officials, it is an absolutely critical part of our job, but as an actual body, it is absolutely not part of our job.

1172
02:05:59,278 --> 02:06:01,078
[SPEAKER_11]: And that is defined in the law.

1173
02:06:01,278 --> 02:06:05,799
[SPEAKER_11]: There's nothing about the public in our required responsibilities.

1174
02:06:06,159 --> 02:06:08,600
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think it's important that we as a body

1175
02:06:09,537 --> 02:06:10,958
[SPEAKER_11]: stick to our responsibilities.

1176
02:06:11,179 --> 02:06:27,053
[SPEAKER_11]: Otherwise, we're going to have presentations on potholes and, you know, and the city budget and, you know, and I think that, but I appreciate you giving me a little bit of room to not look like I just didn't care about the public because I obviously do.

1177
02:06:27,914 --> 02:06:33,899
[SPEAKER_11]: But that is not the responsibility of that's not one of the things listed on what a school committee does.

1178
02:06:36,342 --> 02:06:40,403
[SPEAKER_04]: And point of information, may I ask the three items that a school committee does do?

1179
02:06:41,743 --> 02:06:43,123
[SPEAKER_11]: You know them, you're trying to get.

1180
02:06:43,283 --> 02:06:45,224
[SPEAKER_04]: I do, but I want the community to know them.

1181
02:06:45,264 --> 02:06:45,664
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I know, sorry.

1182
02:06:45,684 --> 02:06:46,684
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is restating them.

1183
02:06:47,444 --> 02:06:58,486
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, it's to supervise and evaluate or hire and fire the superintendent, approve a budget and write policy.

1184
02:06:59,106 --> 02:07:03,207
[SPEAKER_11]: There's always that fourth one of like voting yes on all of these mandatory

1185
02:07:04,501 --> 02:07:05,881
[SPEAKER_11]: reports we must receive.

1186
02:07:05,961 --> 02:07:07,482
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't really know where that fits.

1187
02:07:08,522 --> 02:07:11,743
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, we have to vote yes to receive a grant for instance.

1188
02:07:12,443 --> 02:07:16,624
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's not really any of those three.

1189
02:07:16,904 --> 02:07:19,065
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess technically counts as a policy decision.

1190
02:07:21,585 --> 02:07:33,148
[SPEAKER_11]: So I did, I just want to quickly, member McLaughlin add also like this section six is only the presentations of the public.

1191
02:07:34,530 --> 02:07:41,455
[SPEAKER_11]: This is just floating language that begins before the part of the agenda for which that is an option.

1192
02:07:42,035 --> 02:07:49,260
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's sort of like, no matter how much I try, we can't seem to get them completely separated so that it's not confusing.

1193
02:07:49,280 --> 02:07:52,021
[SPEAKER_11]: I just added a little line and I think it does help a little.

1194
02:07:53,102 --> 02:08:00,487
[SPEAKER_11]: Another option is simply that this has a different font or something like that, but this,

1195
02:08:01,433 --> 02:08:03,934
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, this is not part of number six.

1196
02:08:04,334 --> 02:08:08,014
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is... Sorry, member Russo, sorry.

1197
02:08:08,875 --> 02:08:15,216
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it's just, you know, and truth be told, none of this technically needs to be on the agenda.

1198
02:08:15,776 --> 02:08:30,339
[SPEAKER_11]: I just like it there because I think the new person coming to our agenda, the new mayor, the new school committee member, like this being on the agenda, I think is incredibly helpful because it doesn't say,

1199
02:08:30,714 --> 02:08:34,175
[SPEAKER_11]: go see policy BDH, and then you're like, well, where are our policies?

1200
02:08:34,655 --> 02:08:37,816
[SPEAKER_11]: It just kind of doubles down on what it is.

1201
02:08:40,257 --> 02:08:41,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I just do a time check?

1202
02:08:41,898 --> 02:08:49,540
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the superintendent is in the middle of a number of actual district things going on.

1203
02:08:49,620 --> 02:08:56,743
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is almost 10 past six, and I do think this is worth a shot.

1204
02:08:59,222 --> 02:09:00,562
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is worth a shot.

1205
02:09:00,742 --> 02:09:03,603
[SPEAKER_02]: I think what this does is it lays out two clear paths.

1206
02:09:03,983 --> 02:09:14,025
[SPEAKER_02]: One, if you wanna say something to us, you can ask the superintendent to put you on the agenda 48 hours in advance or whatever the timeframe is that's listed.

1207
02:09:14,585 --> 02:09:15,585
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one option.

1208
02:09:16,566 --> 02:09:23,567
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you can be prepared to speak on any of the new business items that are on our agenda.

1209
02:09:26,041 --> 02:09:30,725
[SPEAKER_02]: those, there are two options, two ways to speak to us.

1210
02:09:31,405 --> 02:09:37,410
[SPEAKER_02]: One, in the like, I wanna talk about something I wanna talk about, you just have to coordinate that in advance.

1211
02:09:37,950 --> 02:09:44,375
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other, as it relates to something that we're deliberating on in the new business or continued business section, at each,

1212
02:09:47,127 --> 02:09:53,669
[SPEAKER_02]: point in the agenda where we are covering that, the chair will ask, is there anyone in the audience who would like to speak?

1213
02:09:53,889 --> 02:09:57,911
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we can hear from them, we can proceed to deliberate, and then we can vote.

1214
02:09:58,431 --> 02:10:01,052
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think there are two clear options.

1215
02:10:02,152 --> 02:10:12,356
[SPEAKER_02]: One is in response to an item on the agenda, and one is, I don't wanna respond to an agenda item, I would like to say something else entirely, and that goes through the superintendent.

1216
02:10:14,377 --> 02:10:18,821
[SPEAKER_02]: We also are able to start our meetings earlier because of the structure and format of the agenda.

1217
02:10:18,901 --> 02:10:19,901
[SPEAKER_02]: It's now quite clear.

1218
02:10:22,203 --> 02:10:29,849
[SPEAKER_02]: And the public knows that we are not gonna take up business in terms of policy and new resolutions before 7 p.m.

1219
02:10:30,810 --> 02:10:32,452
[SPEAKER_02]: that they may want to weigh in about.

1220
02:10:35,474 --> 02:10:37,636
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that, I make a motion to approve.

1221
02:10:37,656 --> 02:10:40,498
[SPEAKER_03]: Back in.

1222
02:10:42,079 --> 02:10:42,440
[SPEAKER_11]: Excellent.

1223
02:10:43,577 --> 02:10:44,138
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Graham.

1224
02:10:44,758 --> 02:10:45,018
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1225
02:10:46,059 --> 02:10:46,880
[SPEAKER_11]: Member McLaughlin.

1226
02:10:47,921 --> 02:10:48,221
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1227
02:10:49,582 --> 02:10:50,883
[SPEAKER_11]: So yes, three in the affirmative.

1228
02:10:50,943 --> 02:10:53,245
[SPEAKER_11]: This will go on our Monday agenda.

1229
02:10:53,285 --> 02:10:54,546
[SPEAKER_11]: I appreciate everybody's time.

1230
02:10:54,566 --> 02:10:55,447
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion to adjourn.

1231
02:10:55,467 --> 02:10:58,249
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there a second?

1232
02:10:58,549 --> 02:11:01,551
[SPEAKER_11]: Second.

1233
02:11:01,772 --> 02:11:02,292
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Graham.

1234
02:11:02,873 --> 02:11:03,113
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1235
02:11:03,833 --> 02:11:04,514
[SPEAKER_11]: Member McLaughlin.

1236
02:11:04,954 --> 02:11:05,274
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1237
02:11:06,255 --> 02:11:06,956
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Russo, yes.

1238
02:11:07,016 --> 02:11:08,297
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, everyone, and have a good night.

1239
02:11:08,317 --> 02:11:09,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1240
02:11:09,057 --> 02:11:09,658
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, everyone.
