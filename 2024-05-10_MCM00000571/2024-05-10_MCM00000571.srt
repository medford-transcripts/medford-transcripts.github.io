1
00:00:00,271 --> 00:00:00,952
[SPEAKER_10]: Welcome, everyone.

2
00:00:01,332 --> 00:00:01,712
[SPEAKER_10]: We made it.

3
00:00:03,913 --> 00:00:08,216
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm thinking we should begin with a quick roll call, see who we got.

4
00:00:09,637 --> 00:00:10,797
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'll just run down this list.

5
00:00:12,999 --> 00:00:14,980
[SPEAKER_10]: Lois, I know is not here.

6
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:16,641
[SPEAKER_10]: Benji.

7
00:00:16,661 --> 00:00:18,062
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm here.

8
00:00:19,602 --> 00:00:19,963
[SPEAKER_10]: Barry.

9
00:00:19,983 --> 00:00:22,384
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm here.

10
00:00:23,385 --> 00:00:25,366
[SPEAKER_10]: Loretta said she couldn't make it.

11
00:00:25,846 --> 00:00:26,266
[SPEAKER_10]: Kathleen.

12
00:00:26,847 --> 00:00:27,247
[SPEAKER_10]: Here.

13
00:00:28,648 --> 00:00:28,888
[SPEAKER_10]: Luke.

14
00:00:31,037 --> 00:00:32,618
[SPEAKER_10]: have not seen Luke yet.

15
00:00:33,878 --> 00:00:34,258
[SPEAKER_10]: Martha?

16
00:00:34,278 --> 00:00:39,340
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, here we go.

17
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,240
[SPEAKER_10]: Perfect.

18
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:41,120
[SPEAKER_10]: Dan?

19
00:00:42,721 --> 00:00:43,101
[SPEAKER_10]: Present.

20
00:00:43,121 --> 00:00:45,022
[SPEAKER_10]: We got Bob?

21
00:00:45,482 --> 00:00:45,982
[SPEAKER_10]: Present.

22
00:00:46,922 --> 00:00:47,323
[SPEAKER_10]: Jessica?

23
00:00:47,343 --> 00:00:48,523
[SPEAKER_12]: Here.

24
00:00:49,823 --> 00:00:50,144
[SPEAKER_10]: John?

25
00:00:56,366 --> 00:00:57,266
[SPEAKER_10]: Not seeing anything.

26
00:00:58,723 --> 00:01:04,287
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, well, I'm here, Sarah and Paul.

27
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:08,450
[SPEAKER_10]: Perfect.

28
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:10,331
[SPEAKER_10]: I see a little wave.

29
00:01:10,351 --> 00:01:12,713
[SPEAKER_10]: That's good enough.

30
00:01:12,813 --> 00:01:13,193
[SPEAKER_10]: Perfect.

31
00:01:13,614 --> 00:01:17,296
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, we have quorum plus, uh, so welcome everyone.

32
00:01:17,857 --> 00:01:22,660
[SPEAKER_10]: And I would like to acknowledge, I think we have some guests as well.

33
00:01:23,841 --> 00:01:26,383
[SPEAKER_10]: Some folks joining us from looks like mothers out front.

34
00:01:32,448 --> 00:01:37,330
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'd like to start with a review of our minutes.

35
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:40,991
[SPEAKER_10]: Has everyone had a chance to look those over with comments?

36
00:01:44,632 --> 00:01:44,812
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

37
00:01:47,173 --> 00:01:51,134
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

38
00:01:51,174 --> 00:01:52,235
[SPEAKER_10]: You'll have to bear with me.

39
00:01:52,275 --> 00:01:57,256
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm still remembering all the procedurals here, but I would entertain a motion to accept the minutes.

40
00:01:58,917 --> 00:01:59,237
[SPEAKER_11]: Second.

41
00:02:01,912 --> 00:02:04,634
[SPEAKER_11]: Somebody has to make the motion before you can second it.

42
00:02:05,555 --> 00:02:06,596
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll make that motion.

43
00:02:07,416 --> 00:02:08,697
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

44
00:02:09,878 --> 00:02:11,459
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure if I'm really allowed to.

45
00:02:11,579 --> 00:02:14,121
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, the chair is not allowed to do that.

46
00:02:14,641 --> 00:02:15,622
[SPEAKER_10]: We're not that formal.

47
00:02:15,742 --> 00:02:19,425
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah.

48
00:02:20,185 --> 00:02:20,585
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

49
00:02:20,786 --> 00:02:21,726
[SPEAKER_10]: Seconded by Paul.

50
00:02:22,086 --> 00:02:22,547
[SPEAKER_10]: You're here.

51
00:02:24,928 --> 00:02:25,209
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

52
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:27,270
[SPEAKER_10]: In that case.

53
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,041
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's commence.

54
00:02:30,321 --> 00:02:36,909
[SPEAKER_10]: I think first things first, we'll throw this over to Brenda with updates from Medford.

55
00:02:38,811 --> 00:02:46,821
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we jump into that as sort of an administrative update, can we talk about the next meeting and our guests at that meeting?

56
00:02:47,956 --> 00:02:52,379
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yes, thanks to Bob for introducing us.

57
00:02:53,320 --> 00:03:06,789
[SPEAKER_10]: I just negotiated a presentation from Senator Mike Barrett, who'll be speaking with us next session, so May 6th, starting around seven o'clock.

58
00:03:06,869 --> 00:03:11,552
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll give a presentation on all things climate policy in Massachusetts.

59
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:23,132
[SPEAKER_10]: So come prepared with whatever questions you might have for him, as well as get ready for what I hope will be a very interesting presentation.

60
00:03:26,495 --> 00:03:38,104
[SPEAKER_01]: I just dropped a link to an article that I thought was interesting about the interactions between the House and the Senate for the committee that he heads.

61
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:50,447
[SPEAKER_01]: seems like they've finally come to a truce and are able to move forward some of the bills that have been waiting for a little while.

62
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:58,853
[SPEAKER_05]: And how long is the session going to last, roughly?

63
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:03,697
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, they ballparked it about 30 to 40-ish minutes.

64
00:04:04,898 --> 00:04:10,582
[SPEAKER_10]: I put it down as a solid 45 to give time for questions that we might have at the end.

65
00:04:13,281 --> 00:04:22,099
[SPEAKER_10]: So we'll still get out with all the time we've been blessed with, that extra eight o'clock finish time.

66
00:04:22,921 --> 00:04:23,963
[SPEAKER_10]: We should be still on track.

67
00:04:31,907 --> 00:04:35,750
[SPEAKER_01]: Great so yeah so Medford updates.

68
00:04:37,091 --> 00:04:47,218
[SPEAKER_01]: We for electrify Medford, we are so close to having the contract with mass CC signed, which is the grantor.

69
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:49,322
[SPEAKER_01]: for this program.

70
00:04:50,502 --> 00:05:01,849
[SPEAKER_01]: And once we do, then we'll be able to reach out to the energy coaches who are being paid for this and start onboarding them and then start the trainings for everybody.

71
00:05:01,869 --> 00:05:12,135
[SPEAKER_01]: And the ideas for that, so I will be doing one training that's introductory to the program.

72
00:05:14,157 --> 00:05:23,261
[SPEAKER_01]: and sort of what the materials that will be, we'll have for coaches and how coaches will be, you know, what coaches will be talking to residents about.

73
00:05:24,722 --> 00:05:32,525
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Abode, who is the consultant here, will have some recorded sessions.

74
00:05:34,406 --> 00:05:39,868
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a couple of in-person sessions where we can, where coaches can,

75
00:05:40,493 --> 00:05:44,315
[SPEAKER_01]: ask questions about some of the materials that they have learned about.

76
00:05:46,696 --> 00:05:58,263
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is one of the things that I wanted to get some feedback from this group, actually, because I know that a few members of this group are actually taking the abode training that was being offered sort of across the country.

77
00:05:58,283 --> 00:06:01,905
[SPEAKER_01]: And we got a few coveted spots there.

78
00:06:01,925 --> 00:06:03,025
[SPEAKER_01]: So

79
00:06:06,484 --> 00:06:09,847
[SPEAKER_01]: So Abode isn't able to do evening sessions for the most part.

80
00:06:09,987 --> 00:06:12,549
[SPEAKER_01]: So we will be having these recorded trainings.

81
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:34,227
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's probably more useful for me to schedule some evening sessions where we're just playing these recorded trainings over Zoom so that everybody's kind of sitting down together to do this rather than expecting people to be finding the time to fit this in.

82
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:36,709
[SPEAKER_01]: here and there on their own time.

83
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:40,531
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that's a good approach for it?

84
00:06:44,994 --> 00:06:47,875
[SPEAKER_12]: As someone who's still trying to find time to fit it in, yes.

85
00:06:50,177 --> 00:06:57,661
[SPEAKER_01]: I had heard that from you where you're saying it was, yeah, it was difficult to find the time for the recorded trainings if you miss the actual sessions.

86
00:06:58,922 --> 00:06:59,042
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

87
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:02,433
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.

88
00:07:02,813 --> 00:07:07,115
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the slides from those trainings will be available for anyone.

89
00:07:07,876 --> 00:07:15,160
[SPEAKER_01]: So whether you're signed up as an energy coach, or you're just interested in the material, I'll be able to share those with you.

90
00:07:20,142 --> 00:07:24,824
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that we have a few folks here that are taking a version of the training.

91
00:07:26,185 --> 00:07:29,687
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you be willing to share your thoughts on it with me?

92
00:07:29,847 --> 00:07:31,748
[SPEAKER_01]: Any suggestions for

93
00:07:32,729 --> 00:07:37,531
[SPEAKER_01]: changes to it, things that you found really helpful, things that you didn't find helpful.

94
00:07:43,674 --> 00:07:44,234
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Bob.

95
00:07:44,334 --> 00:07:50,157
[SPEAKER_05]: I started the training, but I'm only going through one of five sessions, so I don't have too much.

96
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:52,611
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, it was useful.

97
00:07:52,871 --> 00:07:58,895
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the first session we were trained on, okay, what kind of heating system is this?

98
00:07:59,415 --> 00:08:01,276
[SPEAKER_05]: Is oil fired or gas fired?

99
00:08:01,877 --> 00:08:04,178
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it ducted or is it non-ducted?

100
00:08:04,198 --> 00:08:07,620
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was like a lot of nuts and bolts things.

101
00:08:11,302 --> 00:08:12,383
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was interesting.

102
00:08:12,703 --> 00:08:18,427
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems like as a coach, you might have to walk into somebody's basement

103
00:08:20,047 --> 00:08:24,128
[SPEAKER_05]: offer some knowledgeable comments as to what it is.

104
00:08:24,148 --> 00:08:30,729
[SPEAKER_05]: So it looks like you know what you're talking about, that type of thing.

105
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:36,351
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like they changed the training from the time that I took it.

106
00:08:37,071 --> 00:08:43,072
[SPEAKER_01]: The time that I took it, they got into some very detailed heat load calculations in the first course.

107
00:08:43,152 --> 00:08:46,633
[SPEAKER_01]: And my feedback was, that's going to scare some of my coaches away.

108
00:08:48,487 --> 00:08:48,987
[SPEAKER_05]: in the first session.

109
00:08:49,007 --> 00:08:51,229
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't gotten to that yet, but I'm sure it's coming.

110
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:57,574
[SPEAKER_05]: But obviously, if you do an insulation project, that's going to change it.

111
00:08:57,634 --> 00:08:58,955
[SPEAKER_05]: And they were saying, well, you shouldn't.

112
00:08:59,695 --> 00:09:01,697
[SPEAKER_05]: They have all this attic insulation stuff.

113
00:09:01,897 --> 00:09:04,579
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was saying, my house is so clogged with stuff.

114
00:09:05,319 --> 00:09:15,387
[SPEAKER_05]: There ain't no way I'm going to take everything out of my attic and put nine inches of extra insulation on the floor, which is what they advocate.

115
00:09:15,447 --> 00:09:17,068
[SPEAKER_05]: I said, that's totally impractical.

116
00:09:18,403 --> 00:09:20,785
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's some interesting back and forth.

117
00:09:20,805 --> 00:09:24,067
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, you can't possibly expect me to do that.

118
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:29,410
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been in this house for 30 years, and I'm a pack rat.

119
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:30,411
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the way it is.

120
00:09:31,772 --> 00:09:32,392
[SPEAKER_01]: That's interesting.

121
00:09:32,492 --> 00:09:37,236
[SPEAKER_01]: Attic insulation is the most important insulation, though, more so than wall insulation.

122
00:09:37,636 --> 00:09:40,158
[SPEAKER_05]: My stuff is insulating everything, I'm sure.

123
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,100
[SPEAKER_02]: Martha, did you have a comment?

124
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:45,400
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

125
00:09:45,801 --> 00:09:47,581
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to comment on what Bob just said.

126
00:09:47,641 --> 00:09:59,384
[SPEAKER_02]: I threw them out of my house when they told me to clear out my attic so they could put down nine inches of insulation and a new floor, which would mean moving 30 years of stuff out of my attic.

127
00:10:01,045 --> 00:10:04,386
[SPEAKER_02]: I think one advantage of us as earth creature,

128
00:10:11,137 --> 00:10:18,521
[SPEAKER_02]: energy coaches is that we can deal with people's real life perspective on what's possible.

129
00:10:19,622 --> 00:10:40,413
[SPEAKER_02]: I know a lot of this money is supposed to be committed to low-income and underrepresented groups, and I think that makes it even more important to be real about what will people save and what will they have to invest in terms of time and energy, and does that make sense for them.

130
00:10:42,685 --> 00:10:44,005
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, absolutely.

131
00:10:44,945 --> 00:10:58,088
[SPEAKER_01]: Being realistic about it and being really careful about what we're encouraging people to do, understanding that there are limited resources there, both in terms of time and money and all of that.

132
00:10:58,388 --> 00:11:02,988
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

133
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:05,289
[SPEAKER_01]: So one more Electrify Medford thing.

134
00:11:05,309 --> 00:11:10,930
[SPEAKER_01]: I had been thinking a kickoff the week of April 22nd for an event.

135
00:11:15,353 --> 00:11:25,257
[SPEAKER_01]: The closer we get to it without a signed contract, I'm thinking that seems less and less likely and probably not a good idea because it's already so busy with other things and Passover.

136
00:11:26,918 --> 00:11:29,198
[SPEAKER_01]: So the following week might be better.

137
00:11:29,238 --> 00:11:31,779
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's what I'm going to shoot for instead.

138
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:37,382
[SPEAKER_01]: Because as a reminder that week, there's also the community cleanup on the 27th.

139
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:42,464
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the Green Fest with Boston Glory on the 26th.

140
00:11:44,247 --> 00:11:52,617
[SPEAKER_01]: There's an Arbor Day proclamation on the 26th and some like seedling giveaways at the library on the 27th.

141
00:11:53,918 --> 00:11:57,763
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure other things too that I'm missing here, but it's a pretty busy week.

142
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:10,493
[SPEAKER_01]: So moving on to the aggregation supply contract.

143
00:12:10,593 --> 00:12:18,615
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going out to bid on Thursday for a three-year contract for Medford's electricity aggregation.

144
00:12:20,356 --> 00:12:21,916
[SPEAKER_01]: Our current one ends in December.

145
00:12:21,936 --> 00:12:29,119
[SPEAKER_01]: And it looks like we'll be increasing the renewable content of the default option up to 10%.

146
00:12:31,239 --> 00:12:33,660
[SPEAKER_01]: And the rate will be lower than what it is now.

147
00:12:38,095 --> 00:12:49,423
[SPEAKER_01]: And Dan, I know you asked at the last meeting, if all the RECs, if it's all mass class one RECs, it definitely will be.

148
00:12:50,524 --> 00:13:00,591
[SPEAKER_01]: That was something that the consultants didn't recommend at first, and we pushed back on that because we knew that our energy committee and 350 and others would definitely be asking for that.

149
00:13:00,671 --> 00:13:02,532
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for bringing that up.

150
00:13:09,098 --> 00:13:10,099
[SPEAKER_01]: So more to come there.

151
00:13:11,059 --> 00:13:14,962
[SPEAKER_01]: So the curbside composting program.

152
00:13:14,982 --> 00:13:18,685
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have complete up to date numbers on this.

153
00:13:18,985 --> 00:13:29,652
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was two weeks ago, we had over 800 people on the wait list with almost 1000 already composting as well.

154
00:13:29,752 --> 00:13:33,135
[SPEAKER_01]: So the numbers are increasing there steadily.

155
00:13:35,118 --> 00:13:48,088
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think at the last meeting, somebody had asked about doing a bulk compost drop-off in the similar way that Garbage to Garden does in other towns.

156
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:54,833
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we did ask about that and we are actually trying to organize something like that in May.

157
00:13:55,454 --> 00:13:56,775
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have an exact date yet.

158
00:13:57,475 --> 00:14:02,259
[SPEAKER_01]: It probably won't be free because that's not, that wasn't part of our contract with them.

159
00:14:03,852 --> 00:14:14,438
[SPEAKER_01]: but people will probably be able to come to one site to pick up compost in buckets and pay sort of a discounted rate for that.

160
00:14:14,838 --> 00:14:19,380
[SPEAKER_01]: So more details on that once we have more information.

161
00:14:21,342 --> 00:14:22,162
[SPEAKER_09]: That's great.

162
00:14:22,262 --> 00:14:27,025
[SPEAKER_09]: I think since the citywide composting has gone into effect,

163
00:14:28,303 --> 00:14:31,826
[SPEAKER_09]: What I've heard from a lot of the people I know around here, I've heard two things.

164
00:14:31,906 --> 00:14:35,329
[SPEAKER_09]: I've heard, how do I get involved in that?

165
00:14:35,529 --> 00:14:36,650
[SPEAKER_09]: How do I sign up?

166
00:14:38,532 --> 00:14:45,798
[SPEAKER_09]: And a lot of people that I know around the Tufts area have not known about it or weren't aware.

167
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:52,443
[SPEAKER_09]: And secondly, how can we get compost or buy compost from them?

168
00:14:52,503 --> 00:14:56,427
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's great to hear that there could be a bulk compost drop-off.

169
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,239
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.

170
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,001
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's wonderful.

171
00:15:03,061 --> 00:15:22,234
[SPEAKER_01]: And just a reminder for folks, if anybody asks you for more information about this, although you probably know this already, but the email, the website to sign up, well, both to sign up for the program and sign up to volunteer to help out is medfordcompost.com.

172
00:15:29,817 --> 00:15:37,639
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they haven't really started a lot of their serious outreach yet, but we'll be getting into that very soon.

173
00:15:39,419 --> 00:15:50,261
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I just mention that Mothers Up Front had a meeting with Annika, who's the kind of coordinator for this project with G2G.

174
00:15:51,101 --> 00:15:54,382
[SPEAKER_00]: And we talked about ways that we can help support them.

175
00:15:54,422 --> 00:15:59,103
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be door hangers that will be available at some point.

176
00:15:59,423 --> 00:16:12,290
[SPEAKER_00]: to him and flyers and they said that, she said that they're happy to have more people or organizations helping to promote it because so far we're the only ones that have stepped up to do that.

177
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:16,713
[SPEAKER_01]: Great, thank you for doing that.

178
00:16:18,753 --> 00:16:19,593
[SPEAKER_10]: Very appreciated.

179
00:16:19,613 --> 00:16:28,078
[SPEAKER_10]: I might be jumping the gun schedule wise here, but that's definitely something we should try to get involved in.

180
00:16:28,818 --> 00:16:36,041
[SPEAKER_10]: Finding time or hours to devote to that might be a really good way to achieve some of these priority goals that we're looking at.

181
00:16:36,061 --> 00:16:41,364
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.

182
00:16:43,397 --> 00:16:45,038
[SPEAKER_01]: So moving on to zoning.

183
00:16:46,059 --> 00:16:52,503
[SPEAKER_01]: So the City Council's Planning Committee has started looking at zoning changes with a consultant.

184
00:16:54,424 --> 00:16:58,387
[SPEAKER_01]: And the committee is meeting every other Wednesday at 6 o'clock.

185
00:16:59,988 --> 00:17:11,756
[SPEAKER_01]: And the first pass is really just cleaning up some things from the last recodification, definitions and cleaning up tables and moving things around.

186
00:17:13,042 --> 00:17:18,864
[SPEAKER_01]: but then they'll be digging into the more substantial material after that.

187
00:17:18,944 --> 00:17:33,028
[SPEAKER_01]: So resiliency is scheduled to be discussed April 24th, but I think that's really just an initial discussion and I don't think anything regarding it will be voted on until the summer probably.

188
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:41,490
[SPEAKER_01]: But yes, I'll keep an eye on that and let you know the details of it as we go along.

189
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:53,469
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, let's see what else here so green communities has a new level to their to their program.

190
00:17:55,051 --> 00:17:57,634
[SPEAKER_01]: Medford has been a certified green community since.

191
00:17:58,397 --> 00:18:04,338
[SPEAKER_01]: But 2011, I think, and now they're creating sort of a step up above that called climate leaders.

192
00:18:05,699 --> 00:18:09,140
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have a different set of requirements for the climate leaders.

193
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:12,260
[SPEAKER_01]: 1 of them being passing the specialized energy code.

194
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:15,221
[SPEAKER_01]: 1 of them is being having an energy committee.

195
00:18:16,861 --> 00:18:20,802
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we, the only 2 things that we don't haven't.

196
00:18:21,543 --> 00:18:22,423
[SPEAKER_01]: Already completed is.

197
00:18:24,168 --> 00:18:36,353
[SPEAKER_01]: having an electric vehicle first purchasing policy, which is something that we will be moving forward on presenting to the city council.

198
00:18:38,013 --> 00:18:42,535
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also having a decarbonization roadmap for municipal buildings.

199
00:18:43,795 --> 00:18:45,836
[SPEAKER_01]: And Kathleen is actually helping me with that.

200
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:50,898
[SPEAKER_01]: We're putting together the building inventory

201
00:18:52,108 --> 00:19:05,559
[SPEAKER_01]: at this point, and then sort of setting out for the next 25 years, what are the expected, you know, lifespans of the different equipment types in the building, and what do we want to replace them with?

202
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:11,844
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's some technical assistance available through green communities as well to help us out with that.

203
00:19:11,944 --> 00:19:16,248
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but that first step is getting that building inventory together.

204
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:34,385
[SPEAKER_01]: But so the goal is for us to have everything in place by June 30th, because that's the point when we would be eligible for applying for additional grants.

205
00:19:34,665 --> 00:19:38,466
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's still the green communities grants out there that we can take advantage of.

206
00:19:39,246 --> 00:19:46,929
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just going to be additional grants that we have access to on top of that if we have this climate leader certification.

207
00:19:53,464 --> 00:19:56,546
[SPEAKER_06]: This is money from federal government, is that right?

208
00:19:56,906 --> 00:19:57,486
[SPEAKER_01]: From the state.

209
00:19:57,506 --> 00:19:59,027
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, from the state.

210
00:19:59,047 --> 00:20:01,188
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, from the Department of Energy Resources.

211
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:02,309
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

212
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:13,094
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and cities who are certified green communities are eligible for this funding every year.

213
00:20:13,734 --> 00:20:19,697
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really a reliable source of funding that we can use, we can go back to over and over again for different types of

214
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:22,600
[SPEAKER_01]: efficiency and decarbonization projects.

215
00:20:29,422 --> 00:20:30,742
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see, what else?

216
00:20:30,862 --> 00:20:48,348
[SPEAKER_01]: The Climate Equity Council, their last meeting was a couple weeks ago, and the city engineer came by and discussed some stormwater upgrades in South Medford, and that we're applying for

217
00:20:49,255 --> 00:21:04,844
[SPEAKER_01]: MVP municipal vulnerability preparedness grant for and the climate equity Council is going to be submitting a letter of support for that grant application and then they're going to be helping us with outreach to some of the residents in that neighborhood about the project in the fall.

218
00:21:11,431 --> 00:21:28,875
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I think the only other thing that I wanted to mention here was the city council tomorrow night, one of the things that they'll be discussing is the make polluters pay bill and officially supporting that.

219
00:21:30,235 --> 00:21:36,817
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something that 350 Mystic Valley and 350 in general is really supporting.

220
00:21:39,493 --> 00:21:42,834
[SPEAKER_01]: Did anybody go to the 350 meeting about this?

221
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:43,714
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was on the 27th.

222
00:21:43,814 --> 00:21:48,035
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Martha, do you have any?

223
00:21:49,135 --> 00:21:51,816
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I have I have information on it.

224
00:21:52,036 --> 00:21:59,417
[SPEAKER_02]: I think to the extent that this committee as a group or at least as individuals can support it, it's a good thing.

225
00:22:00,218 --> 00:22:00,858
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called.

226
00:22:02,912 --> 00:22:10,155
[SPEAKER_02]: an act establishing a climate change super fund and promoting polluter responsibility.

227
00:22:12,195 --> 00:22:31,222
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a new bill in the mass legislature sponsored by Senators Eldridge and Representative Owens that would require top polluters, which are primarily oil, big oil and gas companies to contribute to a super fund that will be used to pay for climate related damages in Massachusetts.

228
00:22:32,698 --> 00:22:56,552
[SPEAKER_02]: And some other states have been doing this as I'm sure you're aware, the cost of climate adaptation is very high and tort law, environmental litigation is one way to secure funds for Massachusetts cities and towns to do this work.

229
00:22:59,076 --> 00:23:09,441
[SPEAKER_02]: Other things about it, at least 40% of the funding would be targeted to environmental justice areas.

230
00:23:13,502 --> 00:23:14,002
[SPEAKER_02]: What else?

231
00:23:14,122 --> 00:23:19,144
[SPEAKER_02]: And it would be subject to fair wages, prevailing wage requirements.

232
00:23:23,577 --> 00:23:34,905
[SPEAKER_02]: And it would provide funding for undertaking preventative health care programs, as well as physical infrastructure improvements related to climate adaptation.

233
00:23:36,426 --> 00:23:42,490
[SPEAKER_01]: My understanding is that it's really targeting the largest fossil fuel companies.

234
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:51,717
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they had to be responsible for at least 0.05% of the total greenhouse gas emissions from

235
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:59,201
[SPEAKER_01]: 2000 to 2019, so it's really targeting like a tiny number of corporations.

236
00:24:01,123 --> 00:24:10,230
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought that the committee that was looking at that, the Environment and Natural Resources Committee, had essentially killed it in February.

237
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:18,896
[SPEAKER_01]: It was given a study order in February, so I wasn't aware that it was, you know,

238
00:24:19,697 --> 00:24:22,758
[SPEAKER_01]: up for consideration really in this cycle?

239
00:24:24,579 --> 00:24:43,686
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's not really discussed in this, but as you, you know, if you're familiar with the Massachusetts cycle, you know, it's a two-year cycle and things do get reviewed to committee and they do sometimes take a few go-arounds before they become

240
00:24:45,377 --> 00:24:50,500
[SPEAKER_02]: actively sponsored and endorsed by enough of the legislature to pass.

241
00:24:50,620 --> 00:25:03,528
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wouldn't say killed it, is probably put it gently to sleep for a while maybe, but there's, as you know, Mass 350 is still very much working on this.

242
00:25:05,769 --> 00:25:08,270
[SPEAKER_02]: And would like Medford to be one of the supporting communities.

243
00:25:15,874 --> 00:25:21,035
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess that brings me to a general question for Brenda and the committee writ large.

244
00:25:22,096 --> 00:25:25,077
[SPEAKER_10]: Looking at some of these, are there any of these that feel actionable for us?

245
00:25:25,597 --> 00:25:40,941
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you want us to be looking at certain statements being put out by the Climate Equity Council to sign on to, things relating to this make polluters pay bill, or even like joining people for the Arbor Day presentation?

246
00:25:41,221 --> 00:25:43,842
[SPEAKER_10]: Like if any of these feel actionable for us as a committee.

247
00:25:47,208 --> 00:25:54,152
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, interesting so I know a few committee members are also members of trees Medford, or or at least following that.

248
00:25:55,393 --> 00:25:55,653
[SPEAKER_01]: So.

249
00:25:55,673 --> 00:25:58,855
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they'll probably be be there at least.

250
00:25:59,796 --> 00:26:04,439
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if they're looking for more folks to be present there.

251
00:26:04,459 --> 00:26:10,883
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I know some members of the.

252
00:26:12,184 --> 00:26:15,206
[SPEAKER_01]: Of this committee are helping out with, like, the, with the,

253
00:26:15,639 --> 00:26:17,640
[SPEAKER_01]: Boston Glory Greenfest, for instance.

254
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:25,142
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's it's kind of on a, an individual basis, what what you want to get involved with.

255
00:26:27,382 --> 00:26:45,107
[SPEAKER_01]: But definitely, I mean, if folks want to get involved with the getting the word out about the curbside composting, or, you know, again, involved with electrify Medford, and or even just involved in getting the word out about it, if you don't want to be a coach, like, those are all things that I think, as as individuals, it would be great

256
00:26:45,592 --> 00:26:46,352
[SPEAKER_01]: to sign up for.

257
00:26:53,475 --> 00:27:05,960
[SPEAKER_02]: Brenda, following on Will's question, this group historically I think has done things as individuals rather than passing a resolution as a group that goes forward.

258
00:27:06,621 --> 00:27:12,243
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't think of any reason why we couldn't vote a resolution

259
00:27:14,229 --> 00:27:16,470
[SPEAKER_02]: related to environment and energy, do you?

260
00:27:20,211 --> 00:27:21,491
[SPEAKER_06]: Can we make that a motion?

261
00:27:26,873 --> 00:27:38,297
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I move that we endorse the bill to enact a, let's see, let me get the right language here.

262
00:27:41,728 --> 00:27:54,375
[SPEAKER_02]: a climate added bill to enact a polluter responsibility and super fund and climate change super fund bill H872 S481.

263
00:27:54,395 --> 00:27:55,216
[SPEAKER_02]: I second it.

264
00:28:09,064 --> 00:28:10,165
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Bob, I had a question.

265
00:28:10,285 --> 00:28:14,368
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this bill, what's the status of this bill?

266
00:28:14,628 --> 00:28:23,914
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I'm not familiar with what it says.

267
00:28:24,374 --> 00:28:31,219
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a new bill in the Massachusetts legislature sponsored by Senator Eldridge and Representative Owens.

268
00:28:33,285 --> 00:28:40,267
[SPEAKER_02]: that would require top polluters to contribute to a super fund used to pay for climate-related damages in Massachusetts.

269
00:28:43,688 --> 00:28:46,749
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know where it is in the legislative cycle.

270
00:28:46,769 --> 00:28:59,752
[SPEAKER_02]: 350 Massachusetts is trying to get local city and town councils to pass resolutions supporting it.

271
00:29:02,177 --> 00:29:10,665
[SPEAKER_02]: As you know the idea that locals building local support having more cities and towns passing that type of resolution will.

272
00:29:12,447 --> 00:29:14,208
[SPEAKER_02]: Encourage the Legislature to pass.

273
00:29:17,211 --> 00:29:22,896
[SPEAKER_09]: With this impact that are there any superfund sites here that are.

274
00:29:22,916 --> 00:29:26,980
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be impacted by this bill.

275
00:29:28,678 --> 00:29:32,359
[SPEAKER_01]: So this isn't for Superfund sites, it's it's essentially.

276
00:29:33,879 --> 00:29:34,680
[SPEAKER_01]: It's essentially.

277
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:49,163
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what a fee or or fine or something targeting fossil fuel corporations that are responsible for the most greenhouse gas emissions in the in the state.

278
00:29:50,444 --> 00:29:54,165
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, so so it doesn't have any local impact besides.

279
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:03,263
[SPEAKER_09]: being symbolic and targeting?

280
00:30:03,403 --> 00:30:16,711
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, down the road, it would definitely, you know, the idea is it would make money available to produce a source of funds available to cities and towns.

281
00:30:16,931 --> 00:30:26,657
[SPEAKER_02]: And Medford having, you know, several areas identified as environmental justice areas subject to flooding, you know, South Medford, Wellington,

282
00:30:27,647 --> 00:30:35,030
[SPEAKER_02]: Glenn would presumably be very much eligible for this funding.

283
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:56,217
[SPEAKER_02]: The use of the word superfund is really that this idea is modeled on the original superfund, which if you're familiar with it, polluters pay into a superfund to clean up the legacy pollution that they've left.

284
00:31:00,363 --> 00:31:00,883
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, thanks.

285
00:31:01,243 --> 00:31:02,564
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks a lot.

286
00:31:04,084 --> 00:31:16,267
[SPEAKER_01]: If if folks are not comfortable voting on this, because you haven't had the chance to review the bill fully, I think that makes that that would make sense.

287
00:31:17,768 --> 00:31:23,489
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think also, we didn't put it, we didn't call it out specifically on the agenda today.

288
00:31:23,509 --> 00:31:24,810
[SPEAKER_01]: So if there were

289
00:31:29,813 --> 00:31:37,438
[SPEAKER_01]: Members of the public that were interested in, you know, I don't know, weighing in or or.

290
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:43,623
[SPEAKER_01]: Or viewing this tonight, they wouldn't have had notice about it.

291
00:31:46,024 --> 00:31:53,970
[SPEAKER_01]: So it might make more sense in this case to to, you know, if you're supporting it, supporting it at the city council meeting tomorrow night.

292
00:31:59,004 --> 00:32:10,533
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that a rule for us, Brenda, that we have to have items on the agenda a certain amount of time and publicize it, publicize the agenda before we can take a vote at our meeting?

293
00:32:13,135 --> 00:32:23,943
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally, it should be an item on the agenda that's noticed 48 hours ahead of time if it's something that you're officially taking a vote on.

294
00:32:28,458 --> 00:32:37,106
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, this is an ad hoc committee so it's we're not, you know, voting on people's, you know, private property.

295
00:32:39,918 --> 00:32:42,459
[SPEAKER_01]: changes or anything like that, so it's not as big a deal.

296
00:32:42,499 --> 00:32:45,261
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't have any power.

297
00:32:46,161 --> 00:33:08,792
[SPEAKER_11]: And I would note that we have an item called new business on the agenda, and if it is inconsistent to have an item called new business on the agenda and say that we can't take up items that come up in the course of a conversation, I would want to know what the

298
00:33:10,361 --> 00:33:13,665
[SPEAKER_11]: state legislature's timeline is.

299
00:33:13,685 --> 00:33:22,494
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that delaying a month would could make our resolution meaningless and I would rather

300
00:33:25,323 --> 00:33:40,889
[SPEAKER_11]: I would rather go ahead and vote on the motion, especially since city council is taking it up tomorrow, and they may consider us as a body that is credible and worth listening to.

301
00:33:40,909 --> 00:33:40,969
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.

302
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:54,654
[SPEAKER_01]: And the state legislature timeframe is, so what is, it's May and June when they're reconciling the different versions of the climate bill.

303
00:34:04,719 --> 00:34:08,181
[SPEAKER_02]: Does the chairman want to bring it to a vote or some more discussion?

304
00:34:09,682 --> 00:34:11,503
[SPEAKER_10]: I would love to bring it to a vote.

305
00:34:13,324 --> 00:34:20,789
[SPEAKER_01]: And Will, I think you just sent that link to me, so I just dropped the link to the campaign in the chat.

306
00:34:21,329 --> 00:34:21,730
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

307
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:28,614
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'd found the campaign website as well, in case anyone would like to familiarize themselves with the mission.

308
00:34:30,846 --> 00:34:40,071
[SPEAKER_10]: But yes, I would entertain a movement to vote on this, to endorse this policy.

309
00:34:43,292 --> 00:34:43,853
[SPEAKER_11]: So moved.

310
00:34:45,293 --> 00:34:45,654
[SPEAKER_11]: Seconded.

311
00:34:45,694 --> 00:34:45,914
[SPEAKER_11]: Seconded.

312
00:34:47,975 --> 00:34:48,335
[SPEAKER_10]: Excellent.

313
00:34:51,196 --> 00:34:57,620
[SPEAKER_10]: We can do, I don't know if voice works so well online, but I could just go down the list if you'd like.

314
00:35:03,363 --> 00:35:03,703
[SPEAKER_10]: Benji?

315
00:35:06,165 --> 00:35:06,986
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I vote yes.

316
00:35:08,227 --> 00:35:08,547
[SPEAKER_10]: Barry?

317
00:35:09,348 --> 00:35:09,668
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

318
00:35:11,309 --> 00:35:11,790
[SPEAKER_10]: Kathleen?

319
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:17,034
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to abstain for lack of information on my part.

320
00:35:17,574 --> 00:35:17,995
[SPEAKER_10]: Understood.

321
00:35:18,655 --> 00:35:18,975
[SPEAKER_10]: Martha?

322
00:35:19,696 --> 00:35:20,016
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

323
00:35:20,977 --> 00:35:21,277
[SPEAKER_09]: Dan?

324
00:35:22,658 --> 00:35:24,300
[SPEAKER_09]: Will abstain as well.

325
00:35:26,908 --> 00:35:29,990
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I'll abstain because I just don't know what it is yet.

326
00:35:30,431 --> 00:35:31,131
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, wait, wait.

327
00:35:31,191 --> 00:35:32,432
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's start over.

328
00:35:32,533 --> 00:35:34,794
[SPEAKER_04]: Perhaps let's just screen share the text.

329
00:35:35,035 --> 00:35:37,937
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's look at the website, make polluters pay.

330
00:35:37,977 --> 00:35:40,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's look at it together and then start the vote.

331
00:35:45,363 --> 00:35:46,344
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that in the chat?

332
00:35:46,944 --> 00:35:47,064
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

333
00:35:47,084 --> 00:35:53,029
[SPEAKER_10]: If we'd like to discuss it further, I think that's also a fair and right thing to do.

334
00:36:00,455 --> 00:36:08,817
[SPEAKER_10]: I do also want to be mindful of time, knowing that we have our eight o'clock close.

335
00:36:12,917 --> 00:36:16,478
[SPEAKER_10]: Not that I want to rush any, but I also want to be acknowledging that as well.

336
00:36:18,018 --> 00:36:18,518
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Brenda.

337
00:36:20,939 --> 00:36:22,799
[SPEAKER_04]: Will, could you screen share?

338
00:36:24,919 --> 00:36:27,740
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I'm going to pull up the actual text.

339
00:36:29,447 --> 00:36:30,748
[SPEAKER_10]: that might not be worth sharing.

340
00:36:31,268 --> 00:36:34,831
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a summary of it.

341
00:36:36,392 --> 00:36:37,473
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be perfect.

342
00:36:44,378 --> 00:36:45,759
[SPEAKER_10]: Would you be able to send that into the chat?

343
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,341
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I could put the link in.

344
00:36:48,521 --> 00:36:54,466
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, can I share screen?

345
00:36:54,606 --> 00:36:56,948
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, sorry, I went to the wrong site.

346
00:36:57,028 --> 00:36:57,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse me.

347
00:37:09,282 --> 00:37:12,667
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I'm having trouble sharing because I'm on a really old computer.

348
00:37:12,768 --> 00:37:14,330
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me send you the link.

349
00:37:14,991 --> 00:37:17,315
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, if you can leave the link in the chat, we can all follow along.

350
00:37:18,817 --> 00:37:21,821
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a Google Doc, so it should be pretty easy to share.

351
00:37:40,083 --> 00:37:40,664
[SPEAKER_03]: Did that work?

352
00:37:45,970 --> 00:37:46,630
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not.

353
00:37:48,452 --> 00:37:52,297
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it might have just gone to me again, so yeah, I just I can see it here.

354
00:37:52,317 --> 00:37:55,400
[SPEAKER_10]: I am unable to open OK.

355
00:37:58,023 --> 00:37:59,405
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you make me co-host?

356
00:37:59,705 --> 00:38:00,426
[SPEAKER_04]: I can screen share.

357
00:38:10,585 --> 00:38:11,450
[SPEAKER_01]: You should be able to now.

358
00:38:13,218 --> 00:38:13,922
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Sarah.

359
00:38:47,565 --> 00:38:50,607
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this related to the bill?

360
00:38:51,347 --> 00:38:52,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it is.

361
00:38:52,528 --> 00:38:52,808
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

362
00:39:00,211 --> 00:39:03,193
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't think this is the fact sheet you were talking about, though, Martha, was it?

363
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:09,736
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the fact sheet I was talking about, but this is basically the same.

364
00:39:12,037 --> 00:39:13,118
[SPEAKER_02]: Information, I think.

365
00:39:22,348 --> 00:39:22,948
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead, Dan.

366
00:39:24,729 --> 00:39:26,590
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I guess.

367
00:39:28,331 --> 00:39:31,052
[SPEAKER_09]: Personally, I support this.

368
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:35,074
[SPEAKER_09]: But I feel like for this committee.

369
00:39:35,094 --> 00:39:37,555
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess I have 2 thoughts 1.

370
00:39:37,595 --> 00:39:39,676
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think that.

371
00:39:43,618 --> 00:39:49,461
[SPEAKER_09]: We should be looking at 1 side of this and this does appear to be like a 1 side of this.

372
00:39:52,303 --> 00:39:56,905
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, this policy, and again, I'm, I'm keeping my personal thoughts completely over this.

373
00:39:57,605 --> 00:40:04,728
[SPEAKER_09]: And secondly, I, you know, I. I think that we just have not had enough time to.

374
00:40:06,809 --> 00:40:09,990
[SPEAKER_09]: Review this, and it's a complicated subject.

375
00:40:12,071 --> 00:40:13,592
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess I just put it out there.

376
00:40:13,612 --> 00:40:17,013
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel a little bit uncomfortable with how where this is going.

377
00:40:20,052 --> 00:40:21,672
[SPEAKER_10]: I fully agree for what it's worth.

378
00:40:22,313 --> 00:40:22,593
[SPEAKER_10]: Barry?

379
00:40:25,773 --> 00:40:33,415
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's perfectly legitimate for people who are uncomfortable with it to vote no.

380
00:40:34,356 --> 00:40:39,857
[SPEAKER_11]: And I also think that it's completely legitimate for people who feel they don't have enough information

381
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:47,225
[SPEAKER_11]: to abstain, but I think that we should nonetheless go ahead with the vote.

382
00:40:47,285 --> 00:40:49,246
[SPEAKER_11]: There's been a motion, it's been seconded.

383
00:40:51,248 --> 00:40:59,934
[SPEAKER_11]: And I mean, if you lose, that's allowed to happen, but the vote should happen.

384
00:41:02,216 --> 00:41:03,337
[SPEAKER_06]: I concur with Barry.

385
00:41:03,357 --> 00:41:07,119
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree.

386
00:41:15,282 --> 00:41:15,643
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

387
00:41:16,624 --> 00:41:24,496
[SPEAKER_10]: In that case, would people feel comfortable continuing with a vote, recognizing that we have the power to abstain and vote no?

388
00:41:24,976 --> 00:41:29,583
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't have to be unanimous by any stretch of the imagination.

389
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:42,361
[SPEAKER_11]: Procedurally, somebody could also make a motion to table.

390
00:41:42,822 --> 00:41:45,683
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not sure if that can happen once a roll call has started.

391
00:41:47,103 --> 00:41:50,745
[SPEAKER_11]: Somebody with more knowledge of Robert's rules than me would have to say that.

392
00:41:50,865 --> 00:41:57,687
[SPEAKER_11]: But then the motion to table would have to win in order to table.

393
00:41:58,528 --> 00:42:01,729
[SPEAKER_11]: And like I said, it might be too late for that, I don't know.

394
00:42:07,904 --> 00:42:19,248
[SPEAKER_10]: If I can defer to Brenda, I'd love to know what procedure would dictate, but otherwise, we can follow through with a vote, acknowledging our limitations.

395
00:42:20,909 --> 00:42:27,272
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I don't know all of the details of Robert's rules either, unfortunately, so I think it would make sense to follow through with a vote.

396
00:42:27,292 --> 00:42:30,073
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

397
00:42:31,553 --> 00:42:35,095
[SPEAKER_10]: With this in mind, we can start from the top.

398
00:42:37,611 --> 00:42:40,772
[SPEAKER_10]: and I will begin calling roll once again.

399
00:42:44,033 --> 00:42:44,353
[SPEAKER_10]: Benji?

400
00:42:45,453 --> 00:42:46,253
[SPEAKER_07]: I vote yes.

401
00:42:47,374 --> 00:42:47,634
[SPEAKER_10]: Barry?

402
00:42:48,574 --> 00:42:48,894
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

403
00:42:49,754 --> 00:42:50,214
[SPEAKER_10]: Kathleen?

404
00:42:50,915 --> 00:42:51,615
[SPEAKER_07]: Abstaining.

405
00:42:53,075 --> 00:42:53,335
[SPEAKER_10]: Martha?

406
00:42:53,355 --> 00:42:59,997
[SPEAKER_10]: I love Martha.

407
00:43:01,477 --> 00:43:02,477
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, yes.

408
00:43:04,438 --> 00:43:04,598
[SPEAKER_10]: Dan?

409
00:43:05,892 --> 00:43:06,432
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it.

410
00:43:07,813 --> 00:43:08,053
[SPEAKER_05]: Bob.

411
00:43:09,033 --> 00:43:09,774
[SPEAKER_05]: Still abstaining.

412
00:43:11,174 --> 00:43:11,534
[SPEAKER_05]: Jessica.

413
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:13,255
[SPEAKER_12]: Abstaining.

414
00:43:14,856 --> 00:43:15,096
[SPEAKER_10]: John.

415
00:43:17,877 --> 00:43:18,437
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not here.

416
00:43:18,617 --> 00:43:18,877
[SPEAKER_10]: Will.

417
00:43:19,397 --> 00:43:20,078
[SPEAKER_10]: I will abstain.

418
00:43:21,078 --> 00:43:21,418
[SPEAKER_10]: Sarah.

419
00:43:22,899 --> 00:43:23,479
[SPEAKER_04]: I vote yes.

420
00:43:24,879 --> 00:43:25,300
[SPEAKER_10]: And Paul.

421
00:43:28,321 --> 00:43:28,561
[SPEAKER_10]: Muted.

422
00:43:28,921 --> 00:43:29,161
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

423
00:43:33,703 --> 00:43:34,003
[SPEAKER_10]: Brady.

424
00:43:39,622 --> 00:43:43,005
[SPEAKER_10]: And... Oh, shoot.

425
00:43:45,666 --> 00:43:48,448
[SPEAKER_11]: Five yes, five abstain, the motion passes.

426
00:43:48,789 --> 00:43:49,429
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Barry.

427
00:43:52,851 --> 00:43:53,572
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion passes.

428
00:43:55,273 --> 00:44:07,922
[SPEAKER_10]: So if at all possible, it'd be great, we can work with Brenda on this to show some form of recognition and support from this committee

429
00:44:10,968 --> 00:44:16,593
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you like to have a representative speak at the city council meeting tomorrow?

430
00:44:17,433 --> 00:44:19,315
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you like to submit a letter?

431
00:44:20,155 --> 00:44:21,777
[SPEAKER_01]: How would you like to show support?

432
00:44:24,999 --> 00:44:25,980
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to be there.

433
00:44:28,042 --> 00:44:29,423
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to be there too.

434
00:44:30,964 --> 00:44:39,351
[SPEAKER_02]: However, I think it is good to put a written, it doesn't have to be a long letter, but an email to the councilors letting them know.

435
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:51,383
[SPEAKER_10]: Creed, I can draft just a quick statement if we'd like after this and send it over to Brenda.

436
00:44:55,465 --> 00:44:57,286
[SPEAKER_10]: And we can make sure that shared with committee members.

437
00:45:00,587 --> 00:45:00,807
[SPEAKER_10]: So.

438
00:45:02,768 --> 00:45:05,589
[SPEAKER_10]: Are there any other points of discussion we'd like to.

439
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:07,370
[SPEAKER_10]: Touch on before we move on.

440
00:45:12,862 --> 00:45:13,702
[SPEAKER_10]: hearing and seeing none.

441
00:45:16,804 --> 00:45:23,446
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it all right, since we are running late, to table a conversation for another day, Brenda?

442
00:45:25,107 --> 00:45:25,987
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, definitely.

443
00:45:26,468 --> 00:45:36,832
[SPEAKER_10]: ICR finalizing the MEEC priorities, I recognize that would be a substantial conversation, one that would potentially take us quite a bit of time.

444
00:45:39,052 --> 00:45:43,253
[SPEAKER_10]: I would love to hear these updates and move on, if that is all right.

445
00:45:43,273 --> 00:45:50,874
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if I have saying power on that, or if we want to put that to a vote, or if we need to put that to a vote.

446
00:45:53,795 --> 00:46:04,197
[SPEAKER_01]: Just so you know, the tree ordinance updates, unless someone else in the group has them, Loretta just sent me a couple of sentences, so that shouldn't take long to share.

447
00:46:08,873 --> 00:46:12,855
[SPEAKER_10]: Right here, right?

448
00:46:15,057 --> 00:46:12,855
725.

449
00:46:15,077 --> 00:46:16,398
[SPEAKER_10]: I, I think the.

450
00:46:16,418 --> 00:46:19,580
[SPEAKER_10]: Priorities would take quite a bit of time.

451
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:21,181
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I'd feel comfortable.

452
00:46:22,641 --> 00:46:25,203
[SPEAKER_10]: Pushing that to another week, another session.

453
00:46:27,404 --> 00:46:29,045
[SPEAKER_10]: Just to make sure we give it due diligence.

454
00:46:29,846 --> 00:46:35,569
[SPEAKER_09]: Dan, I would suggest that I, I looked at the sheet and didn't see any.

455
00:46:37,466 --> 00:46:43,953
[SPEAKER_09]: Or a noticeable kind of involvement on there for people, I would suggest that people go in and put in their priorities.

456
00:46:45,234 --> 00:46:50,439
[SPEAKER_09]: Any thoughts and we can use that as the basis of the discussion.

457
00:46:54,964 --> 00:46:55,865
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, actually.

458
00:46:56,989 --> 00:46:58,831
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, brings up a good point.

459
00:46:58,932 --> 00:46:59,552
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we should.

460
00:47:00,634 --> 00:47:04,758
[SPEAKER_10]: If it's all right with Paul, who's next to speak, I'd like to take probably 10.

461
00:47:05,179 --> 00:47:07,181
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd like to take about 10 minutes of discussion.

462
00:47:08,503 --> 00:47:10,685
[SPEAKER_10]: To kind of orient ourselves for the year.

463
00:47:13,429 --> 00:47:16,372
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I would love to entertain a discussion.

464
00:47:18,142 --> 00:47:43,988
[SPEAKER_10]: given that we've kind of set aside these general priorities of decarbonization and outreach to discuss tangible goals that we as a committee could begin to orient ourselves towards, keeping in mind this is not likely to end in any votes or any major decisions, simply a discussion to kind of establish some guiding tracks

465
00:47:45,356 --> 00:47:48,717
[SPEAKER_10]: uh, that we can begin to, uh, move down for that year.

466
00:47:50,478 --> 00:47:52,759
[SPEAKER_01]: I dropped the Google doc link in the chat.

467
00:47:52,899 --> 00:47:56,220
[SPEAKER_01]: Will do you, would it be helpful if I shared that on my screen?

468
00:47:56,940 --> 00:48:01,082
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I actually, I think I can do the same if you'd like here.

469
00:48:02,723 --> 00:48:04,623
[SPEAKER_10]: I will share the screen here.

470
00:48:04,643 --> 00:48:14,627
[SPEAKER_10]: Is everyone seeing our priorities list?

471
00:48:17,746 --> 00:48:19,828
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you zoom in on it at all?

472
00:48:21,490 --> 00:48:25,693
[SPEAKER_01]: I see the whole sheet and so the words at the top are a little small.

473
00:48:26,354 --> 00:48:26,794
[SPEAKER_10]: How's this?

474
00:48:26,814 --> 00:48:28,115
[SPEAKER_01]: That looks great.

475
00:48:30,357 --> 00:48:36,402
[SPEAKER_09]: You should probably note too, I don't think that's in any particular order, right?

476
00:48:37,022 --> 00:48:38,203
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, that is correct.

477
00:48:39,530 --> 00:48:51,472
[SPEAKER_10]: These were kind of distilled umbrella priorities that I think deserve a little more specificity, particularly towards actionable goals.

478
00:48:53,753 --> 00:48:58,754
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'd like to open that for discussion, at least for the next, I'd say, seven minutes.

479
00:49:02,814 --> 00:49:04,555
[SPEAKER_01]: So on that second tab,

480
00:49:07,867 --> 00:49:10,039
[SPEAKER_01]: it gets into, I think, more detail.

481
00:49:47,837 --> 00:49:49,558
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess I can start with a general thought.

482
00:49:49,838 --> 00:50:04,244
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the power of this committee and where we can make the most impact is in community outreach and local decarbonization or local initiatives.

483
00:50:05,525 --> 00:50:16,230
[SPEAKER_09]: And the more that we are visible and the more that we reach out to the, I hate to say changing Medford, but you know, that the kind of,

484
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:20,741
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, it's a lot of ways to college town.

485
00:50:20,801 --> 00:50:22,341
[SPEAKER_09]: There's young families moving in here.

486
00:50:23,581 --> 00:50:25,962
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a lot of people who are very interested in this kind of thing.

487
00:50:26,162 --> 00:50:32,424
[SPEAKER_09]: And the more we can reach out to them in the places that they are, they're in the better.

488
00:50:33,324 --> 00:50:45,667
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would put out there that it's a, the more we can do on social media and the more that we can do kind of locally and reach out to the community, the better.

489
00:50:49,947 --> 00:51:05,552
[SPEAKER_04]: And to Dan's point, if you notice in the description column, again and again, it says raise awareness, raise awareness, speak, spread the word, communicate.

490
00:51:06,193 --> 00:51:07,353
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all outreach.

491
00:51:08,493 --> 00:51:13,555
[SPEAKER_04]: Many, many of these priorities, outreach is part of the language.

492
00:51:15,796 --> 00:51:18,177
[SPEAKER_04]: So I can...

493
00:51:19,464 --> 00:51:31,066
[SPEAKER_04]: I can take on one thing, which I think is helpful, which is to make another communication channel, which is Instagram, that's really widely used.

494
00:51:32,707 --> 00:51:39,248
[SPEAKER_04]: So by next meeting, I will show it to you, I will get that page started.

495
00:51:39,968 --> 00:51:42,109
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would like everybody's help in

496
00:51:45,375 --> 00:51:47,797
[SPEAKER_04]: drawing attention to it, because there's 12 of us.

497
00:51:48,417 --> 00:51:55,381
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we each invite five people, or if we each invite 10 people, that's 120 followers.

498
00:51:56,442 --> 00:52:06,348
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there's a potential for massive growth with social media when you invite your friends to engage with your content.

499
00:52:07,469 --> 00:52:12,752
[SPEAKER_04]: And because you have some friendship, your friends will support you and engage with your content.

500
00:52:22,086 --> 00:52:23,447
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree with Sarah.

501
00:52:25,327 --> 00:52:29,409
[SPEAKER_06]: Although I no longer use Instagram, I was kicked off.

502
00:52:30,389 --> 00:52:32,890
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have.

503
00:52:34,851 --> 00:52:37,752
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so.

504
00:52:38,853 --> 00:52:42,875
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think Instagram is very, very solid platform to put this on.

505
00:52:43,435 --> 00:52:48,857
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think in terms of engagement with students, I think that's an excellent idea.

506
00:52:49,641 --> 00:52:51,542
[SPEAKER_06]: So I look forward to whatever you do.

507
00:52:51,702 --> 00:52:58,587
[SPEAKER_06]: And perhaps by then, I'll re-emerge on Instagram as somebody else.

508
00:52:58,867 --> 00:52:59,367
[SPEAKER_06]: Who knows?

509
00:53:01,509 --> 00:53:01,669
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

510
00:53:08,633 --> 00:53:31,663
[SPEAKER_12]: But I also think there are very strong, I mean, I know Instagram is very big with students, and there's a definite population that is using Instagram, but Medford has some very, very strong Facebook pages that are big.

511
00:53:33,401 --> 00:53:44,706
[SPEAKER_12]: incredibly strong and incredibly active currently, that we just also want to make sure we're not forgetting, because that's where a lot of Medford's information is passed.

512
00:53:45,726 --> 00:53:52,709
[SPEAKER_06]: But on Instagram, you have the choice of sharing whatever you post over there on Facebook too.

513
00:53:52,989 --> 00:54:01,493
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you do it properly, whatever you post on Instagram gets on Facebook.

514
00:54:01,533 --> 00:54:01,653
[SPEAKER_06]: So

515
00:54:03,288 --> 00:54:08,469
[SPEAKER_06]: As long as the two sites are connected, I think that'll work out.

516
00:54:09,409 --> 00:54:16,011
[SPEAKER_09]: I would say too, I don't think it's like saying we should use one in favor of the other or stop using another.

517
00:54:16,031 --> 00:54:19,091
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just expanding, right?

518
00:54:20,051 --> 00:54:24,932
[SPEAKER_09]: To Instagram, TikTok, to reach a wider audience.

519
00:54:25,473 --> 00:54:27,653
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't mean we have to stop using Facebook.

520
00:54:28,636 --> 00:54:30,117
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I know.

521
00:54:30,277 --> 00:54:31,038
[SPEAKER_04]: It really is.

522
00:54:32,098 --> 00:54:34,219
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a demographic divide.

523
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:42,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Facebook is increasingly skewed towards an older population, and Instagram is more popular with the younger population.

524
00:54:43,025 --> 00:54:46,407
[SPEAKER_04]: But both those platforms are now part of the same company.

525
00:54:47,692 --> 00:54:47,892
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.

526
00:54:48,332 --> 00:54:50,754
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I definitely know that.

527
00:54:50,814 --> 00:54:52,515
[SPEAKER_12]: And I definitely know that you post on one.

528
00:54:52,575 --> 00:54:54,336
[SPEAKER_12]: It shows up on the other and things like that.

529
00:54:54,396 --> 00:55:05,422
[SPEAKER_12]: I just want to want to point out that there are definitely community pages on Facebook that are incredibly active and where people are going to get information.

530
00:55:05,522 --> 00:55:09,284
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just want to point out that those specific pages exist.

531
00:55:10,324 --> 00:55:13,406
[SPEAKER_01]: And Sarah, let's connect before the next meeting to

532
00:55:13,967 --> 00:55:31,693
[SPEAKER_01]: just so that you can get a clear picture of what social media accounts exist already in the city and Go Green Medford and things like that so that you can make sure that anything you're looking at is additive to that.

533
00:55:33,634 --> 00:55:34,394
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, of course.

534
00:55:36,315 --> 00:55:42,437
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think Sarah had maybe suggested this at a previous meeting that in addition to posting

535
00:55:43,498 --> 00:56:01,683
[SPEAKER_02]: material or having our own Instagram account, we could post on the sites of city council members or others who are active posters themselves and add comments, engage with them.

536
00:56:02,943 --> 00:56:05,804
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also an active Reddit site for Medford.

537
00:56:11,345 --> 00:56:11,505
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

538
00:56:15,691 --> 00:56:19,652
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just wanted to bring up the urban meadows things again.

539
00:56:20,592 --> 00:56:38,557
[SPEAKER_06]: If we're going to do anything with that in terms of finding a place or rather, you know, a place, small places to rewild, then the time to do that is now.

540
00:56:42,572 --> 00:56:49,137
[SPEAKER_06]: If there is any seeding to be done or preparation of ground to be done, that needs to be done soon.

541
00:56:51,359 --> 00:57:06,871
[SPEAKER_06]: So if we can have a conversation about that at some point, get some input from the city in terms of where we can have some geographic specificity to this.

542
00:57:09,462 --> 00:57:18,064
[SPEAKER_01]: And Paul, since the last meeting, I looked into this a little bit and I found out that the McGlynn Playground, when that's done, will have a pollinator garden as part of it.

543
00:57:19,525 --> 00:57:23,106
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think Wright's Pond either does or will.

544
00:57:23,726 --> 00:57:26,207
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't pinned down whether that actually exists right now.

545
00:57:26,227 --> 00:57:26,267
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

546
00:57:28,627 --> 00:57:29,227
[SPEAKER_11]: It exists.

547
00:57:30,128 --> 00:57:30,388
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.

548
00:57:30,948 --> 00:57:31,888
[SPEAKER_11]: Or has existed.

549
00:57:31,968 --> 00:57:33,869
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm assuming it will exist again this year.

550
00:57:35,489 --> 00:57:37,930
[SPEAKER_06]: So we should put in place some sort of

551
00:57:40,029 --> 00:57:52,074
[SPEAKER_06]: some rudiments of a plan to do something with that ground, who gets involved, who brings out the shovels, stuff like that.

552
00:57:52,954 --> 00:57:58,457
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just putting that out in terms of specifics.

553
00:58:03,479 --> 00:58:05,280
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I think an important part of this is,

554
00:58:06,948 --> 00:58:14,954
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, having specific people attached to the different, um, projects that are under these, these priorities.

555
00:58:15,014 --> 00:58:15,235
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

556
00:58:15,295 --> 00:58:35,550
[SPEAKER_01]: So that, um, yeah, I know, Will, I think you had said, um, when we were talking, um, you would love it if we could just, you know, if there are projects that people are working on that are, that people are heading up that the meetings could be, you know, going to the people and getting updates from about the different projects they're working on.

557
00:58:36,405 --> 00:58:36,846
[SPEAKER_01]: separately.

558
00:58:36,866 --> 00:58:39,852
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that makes a lot of sense.

559
00:58:42,367 --> 00:58:47,329
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I'll weigh in briefly, acknowledging a lack of time as always.

560
00:58:48,509 --> 00:58:59,254
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, I could imagine, I know at one point or another, Barry and Luke had mentioned different solar projects they're interested in heading up.

561
00:59:00,734 --> 00:59:09,498
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know many of us are very vocal and active folks that I want to use this potentially as a platform to gain

562
00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:19,163
[SPEAKER_10]: to gain support and give extra assistance to those that are heading these kinds of projects.

563
00:59:19,944 --> 00:59:33,112
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'd love to see this committee and committee members take on extra little projects here and there on a volunteer and as needed basis or wanted basis.

564
00:59:33,932 --> 00:59:38,475
[SPEAKER_10]: And this will be an opportunity for us to check in on those projects and give support and advice as needed.

565
00:59:40,353 --> 00:59:50,820
[SPEAKER_10]: to kind of give a different scope as to what these meetings could look like in the future, or at least a new way of treating our time here.

566
00:59:54,783 --> 01:00:02,049
[SPEAKER_10]: So seeing something like Paul expressing interest in the nature restoration and this wilding initiative,

567
01:00:04,037 --> 01:00:06,358
[SPEAKER_10]: I know I would like to support that as well.

568
01:00:06,398 --> 01:00:10,159
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know we have community garden groups that are active as well in Medford.

569
01:00:11,279 --> 01:00:19,682
[SPEAKER_10]: So finding opportunities outside of these monthly meetings to establish a presence, begin that process, feels like a great place to start.

570
01:00:24,824 --> 01:00:29,325
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so what should we do as an actionable thing?

571
01:00:30,386 --> 01:00:33,727
[SPEAKER_06]: Just one thing we can think of right now.

572
01:00:44,062 --> 01:00:47,063
[SPEAKER_01]: My impression is that everyone has very different interests here.

573
01:00:48,524 --> 01:00:59,888
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think the thing to do is to sign up on this sheet for whichever project that you are interested in heading up or supporting.

574
01:01:02,448 --> 01:01:12,272
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll know which projects actually have active interest to pursue, right?

575
01:01:13,842 --> 01:01:16,943
[SPEAKER_09]: I would say to put under the notes or questions, but but.

576
01:01:18,344 --> 01:01:23,866
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, you know, ideas, specific ideas that you have of what it's like to Paul's point.

577
01:01:24,626 --> 01:01:28,368
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, if you ask me what we could do right now, I think.

578
01:01:29,488 --> 01:01:31,109
[SPEAKER_09]: The native, uh.

579
01:01:32,349 --> 01:01:38,471
[SPEAKER_09]: But the urban meadows, uh, idea is great and I know in previous meetings, we talked about, um.

580
01:01:39,472 --> 01:01:41,933
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, reaching out to local schools and.

581
01:01:43,242 --> 01:01:45,143
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, you know, students and doing something there.

582
01:01:45,183 --> 01:01:54,346
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that all that kind of ties together, uh, between a pollinator garden and, uh, urban meadows, getting people involved in planting, reaching out to the city.

583
01:01:54,466 --> 01:01:56,027
[SPEAKER_09]: So it feels like there's a big project there.

584
01:01:56,987 --> 01:01:57,927
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, but.

585
01:01:59,408 --> 01:02:04,049
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not clear to me right now who's going to do what, uh, based off of these priorities.

586
01:02:09,820 --> 01:02:25,168
[SPEAKER_04]: Earlier, I mentioned that I would really like to make a high school visit to recruit volunteers, especially the students who are passionate about the environmental field, which is, in my opinion, very interesting.

587
01:02:27,369 --> 01:02:29,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, so I would like to recruit some volunteers.

588
01:02:30,831 --> 01:02:34,432
[SPEAKER_04]: And I wanted to know how the rest of you feel about

589
01:02:36,816 --> 01:02:46,204
[SPEAKER_04]: me and any of you who want to join me on a high school visit to recruit volunteers for a urban meadows planting project.

590
01:02:47,265 --> 01:02:47,806
[SPEAKER_06]: Sign me up.

591
01:02:51,849 --> 01:02:52,530
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, Paul.

592
01:02:53,831 --> 01:02:55,873
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll figure out a good week.

593
01:02:56,754 --> 01:02:57,014
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

594
01:02:57,835 --> 01:02:59,216
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's do it sooner than later.

595
01:03:00,749 --> 01:03:06,150
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's make sure that we connect with the folks at the high school so you're not just strange adults showing up.

596
01:03:06,250 --> 01:03:08,791
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we've got to schedule in advance.

597
01:03:09,691 --> 01:03:12,731
[SPEAKER_12]: And figure out the right webs or whatever it is.

598
01:03:13,032 --> 01:03:14,032
[SPEAKER_12]: Sure, sure.

599
01:03:14,832 --> 01:03:18,273
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and that leads to a question, Brenda.

600
01:03:18,873 --> 01:03:22,213
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we tap some of those funds that are set aside for this committee?

601
01:03:22,613 --> 01:03:29,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we tap those funds to buy the seeds for wildflowers, the things that birds and pollinators like to eat?

602
01:03:32,578 --> 01:03:34,679
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would need to follow up with Alicia about this.

603
01:03:34,819 --> 01:03:48,025
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure what funds are set aside for this committee or if it's just the planning development sustainability budget that is tapped into if there's a project that we're working on.

604
01:03:49,225 --> 01:03:52,207
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need to make sure that that's something that's actually available.

605
01:03:53,407 --> 01:03:54,888
[SPEAKER_06]: I have two pounds of seed.

606
01:03:55,908 --> 01:03:57,029
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

607
01:03:59,010 --> 01:04:01,471
[SPEAKER_06]: So that should be enough to cover both areas of

608
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:03,681
[SPEAKER_06]: whatever we're gonna do, so.

609
01:04:04,682 --> 01:04:05,502
[SPEAKER_06]: What kind of seed?

610
01:04:05,562 --> 01:04:06,923
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll give that out for free, so.

611
01:04:08,004 --> 01:04:09,165
[SPEAKER_06]: What kind of seed, Paul?

612
01:04:10,146 --> 01:04:18,512
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, um, it's, uh, I, I bought these from New England, uh, local, it's, it's New England local flowers.

613
01:04:20,233 --> 01:04:20,313
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

614
01:04:26,755 --> 01:04:35,721
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, this is a wonderful beginning of a discussion, one that I think, when we have more time and other meetings, will continue.

615
01:04:36,682 --> 01:04:53,494
[SPEAKER_10]: But I would like to, we have that document shared back in the chat, so I'd love to see folks begin thinking, when time allows, of very specific, hopefully small action items that we can begin

616
01:04:55,755 --> 01:04:57,456
[SPEAKER_10]: on a volunteer basis as we'd like.

617
01:04:58,116 --> 01:05:03,058
[SPEAKER_10]: So things like spreading those seeds and identifying those spaces would be an awesome place to start.

618
01:05:03,919 --> 01:05:06,240
[SPEAKER_10]: Seeing a spring is springing very rapidly.

619
01:05:08,441 --> 01:05:17,625
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think that is kind of how I want to end this section if there are no other statements people would like to add.

620
01:05:21,006 --> 01:05:22,827
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you send out where

621
01:05:24,198 --> 01:05:38,007
[SPEAKER_06]: these plots are geographically, Brenda, in terms of where we can go and just take a look, sort of get a layout of land before we embark on this process, you know.

622
01:05:38,027 --> 01:05:40,568
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, have plots been identified?

623
01:05:40,928 --> 01:05:42,649
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not aware of locations.

624
01:05:43,510 --> 01:05:46,932
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I thought you said there was somewhere in Wright's Pond that you had...

625
01:05:50,656 --> 01:05:51,437
[SPEAKER_06]: Marked awful.

626
01:05:51,497 --> 01:05:52,497
[SPEAKER_06]: Did I hear that wrong?

627
01:05:52,637 --> 01:05:53,378
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.

628
01:05:53,558 --> 01:06:03,084
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just saying that there are pollinator gardens that already exist at the pond and that are being planned as part of the playground at McGlynn.

629
01:06:03,525 --> 01:06:08,488
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's being planted, like the city is planting that with the playground funding.

630
01:06:08,508 --> 01:06:13,091
[SPEAKER_12]: And there's also a pollinator garden at the Mississauga as well.

631
01:06:15,455 --> 01:06:19,498
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I was just pointing out that there are existing ones that are done or planned, yeah.

632
01:06:20,639 --> 01:06:28,284
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to point out that this could happen anywhere, any little plot of land that's available, that's just sitting there doing nothing.

633
01:06:28,824 --> 01:06:30,145
[SPEAKER_06]: It could be in front of a store.

634
01:06:30,606 --> 01:06:32,707
[SPEAKER_06]: It could be besides a school.

635
01:06:33,187 --> 01:06:38,291
[SPEAKER_06]: It could be besides an apartment building, as long as it's public property, obviously.

636
01:06:38,371 --> 01:06:43,434
[SPEAKER_06]: So it doesn't have to be like an elaborate thing, but...

637
01:06:44,484 --> 01:06:51,387
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's important to identify it early so we can get to work.

638
01:06:51,567 --> 01:06:52,928
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all I'm saying.

639
01:06:56,649 --> 01:07:00,631
[SPEAKER_05]: And Brenda, you might want to check with the Brooks Estate to see if there's any available land there.

640
01:07:04,853 --> 01:07:05,714
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a good point.

641
01:07:06,094 --> 01:07:12,997
[SPEAKER_01]: And let me check in with Amanda Centrella here in my office, who focuses on our parks projects too.

642
01:07:13,860 --> 01:07:19,326
[SPEAKER_01]: she's probably more aware of areas around the city that would be appropriate for this.

643
01:07:20,688 --> 01:07:27,856
[SPEAKER_02]: You might want to talk with the Girl Scouts, because I recall they did a project at the fells on some Medford land.

644
01:07:27,916 --> 01:07:34,283
[SPEAKER_02]: They basically reclaimed some land that had been trashed and put in some native species.

645
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:44,080
[SPEAKER_10]: Alrighty.

646
01:07:46,741 --> 01:07:47,602
[SPEAKER_10]: I think this is great.

647
01:07:48,082 --> 01:08:06,690
[SPEAKER_10]: Paul, we're not giving you as much time as I think you were allotted or deserve, but we could do an abridged version or move your discussion to another day, depending on how you feel, what feels most comfortable.

648
01:08:08,551 --> 01:08:10,652
[SPEAKER_06]: How much time have we got, sir?

649
01:08:11,072 --> 01:08:11,493
[SPEAKER_10]: We're looking at 747.

650
01:08:14,351 --> 01:08:18,054
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you know, I'll go through it quickly.

651
01:08:18,114 --> 01:08:19,816
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll share my screen, if you don't mind.

652
01:08:19,856 --> 01:08:22,898
[SPEAKER_06]: But you need to give me, I think, privileges.

653
01:08:23,579 --> 01:08:24,419
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep, I just did.

654
01:08:25,540 --> 01:08:26,141
[SPEAKER_10]: It's all yours.

655
01:08:41,794 --> 01:08:42,815
[SPEAKER_06]: Can everyone see this?

656
01:08:46,225 --> 01:08:46,445
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

657
01:08:47,246 --> 01:08:50,227
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, but it's not in presentation mode.

658
01:08:50,808 --> 01:08:52,249
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I'm trying to switch that.

659
01:08:52,569 --> 01:08:53,289
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you see it now?

660
01:08:54,470 --> 01:08:58,012
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, so this is a paper that came out just last month.

661
01:09:00,333 --> 01:09:08,518
[SPEAKER_06]: It talks about the pervasive environmental chemicals that are there and they impair oligodendrocyte development.

662
01:09:08,578 --> 01:09:14,361
[SPEAKER_06]: And oligodendrocytes, I'll go into that, but this was published in Nature Neuroscience 25th of March.

663
01:09:17,591 --> 01:09:26,078
[SPEAKER_06]: So what is the function of oligodendrocytes and what are the links of oligodendrocytes to disease?

664
01:09:26,398 --> 01:09:29,000
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me just, okay.

665
01:09:30,742 --> 01:09:35,446
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is a schematic of some of the cell types that are present in the brain.

666
01:09:36,627 --> 01:09:38,068
[SPEAKER_06]: You can see the neurons there.

667
01:09:39,669 --> 01:09:40,730
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you see my mouse?

668
01:09:42,551 --> 01:09:43,032
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I can.

669
01:09:43,595 --> 01:09:43,836
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

670
01:09:43,976 --> 01:09:44,997
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's a neuron there.

671
01:09:45,037 --> 01:09:49,745
[SPEAKER_06]: There's lots of neurons billions of neurons in your brain but they all need support.

672
01:09:49,885 --> 01:09:57,717
[SPEAKER_06]: So support cells are like microglia astrocytes and of course oligodendrocytes.

673
01:09:58,408 --> 01:10:04,912
[SPEAKER_06]: And oligodendrocytes, the main function of oligodendrocytes is that they provide insulation for neurons.

674
01:10:05,232 --> 01:10:14,417
[SPEAKER_06]: So neurons talk to each other, electrical signals go back and forth, but of course, you can't have naked electrical wires in your brain.

675
01:10:14,857 --> 01:10:17,939
[SPEAKER_06]: Otherwise you get, well, you just go mad.

676
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:30,627
[SPEAKER_06]: But so these cells actually provide the myelin sheets that insulate the axons between neurons.

677
01:10:31,227 --> 01:10:39,212
[SPEAKER_06]: And they allow communication and of course they support the maintenance of these axons that communicate between neurons.

678
01:10:39,252 --> 01:10:43,995
[SPEAKER_06]: So very, very important cell type, support cell type in the brain.

679
01:10:45,928 --> 01:11:10,248
[SPEAKER_06]: And this function in oligodendrocytes is linked to a bunch of diseases, Alzheimer's disease, amyotropic lateral sclerosis, multiple system atrophy, degenerative disease of all sorts, Parkinson's disease, and there's also some indications that there are connections to ADD and ADHD.

680
01:11:11,126 --> 01:11:17,128
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, so what these people wanted to look at was two classes of compounds really.

681
01:11:17,608 --> 01:11:19,688
[SPEAKER_06]: Quats and OPFRs.

682
01:11:20,569 --> 01:11:23,749
[SPEAKER_06]: Quats are basically quaternary ammonium compounds.

683
01:11:23,769 --> 01:11:28,591
[SPEAKER_06]: These are also known as quats and these are potent disinfectants.

684
01:11:29,231 --> 01:11:33,072
[SPEAKER_06]: They're found in all kinds of household cleaners, disinfectant sprays, wipes.

685
01:11:33,792 --> 01:11:36,873
[SPEAKER_06]: The CDC considers quats to be a low-level disinfectant.

686
01:11:37,859 --> 01:11:41,841
[SPEAKER_06]: And that is effective against most nasty stuff that we encounter.

687
01:11:42,682 --> 01:11:43,762
[SPEAKER_06]: Bacterial viruses.

688
01:11:45,123 --> 01:11:58,570
[SPEAKER_06]: And some fungi and QACs, that's the other term for them, are certified by the EPA as actually as pesticides and are often the reason a product claims to be antibacterial.

689
01:12:00,195 --> 01:12:03,378
[SPEAKER_06]: OPFRs are another class of compounds that these guys looked at.

690
01:12:03,398 --> 01:12:07,563
[SPEAKER_06]: These are organophosphate flame retardants.

691
01:12:07,903 --> 01:12:09,885
[SPEAKER_06]: They're organic esters of phosphoric acid.

692
01:12:10,726 --> 01:12:18,755
[SPEAKER_06]: These are used as flame retardants in plasticizers, lubricants, textiles, furniture, carpets, electronics, building insulation.

693
01:12:19,235 --> 01:12:27,038
[SPEAKER_06]: They're also used in all sorts of production of dyes, varnishes, adhesives, synthetic resins.

694
01:12:27,678 --> 01:12:31,780
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can see that they're very promiscuous all over the place.

695
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:35,261
[SPEAKER_06]: OPFRs are also classified into four main groups.

696
01:12:36,161 --> 01:12:42,024
[SPEAKER_06]: There are inorganic, halogenated organic, organophosphate, and nitrogen-based.

697
01:12:42,444 --> 01:12:47,986
[SPEAKER_06]: And the class that they looked at is the organophosphate, which is very commonly used in all sorts of things.

698
01:12:49,176 --> 01:12:55,759
[SPEAKER_06]: So, the major findings of the study, I'm going to go through this really quickly since we don't have too much time.

699
01:12:57,120 --> 01:13:09,966
[SPEAKER_06]: These guys developed a toxicity screening platform to look at about 1,823 environmental chemicals and to see what effect these had on oligodendrocyte development.

700
01:13:12,393 --> 01:13:23,422
[SPEAKER_06]: First finding was quaternary compounds commonly found in personal care products and disinfectants were identified as chemicals that stop the generation of oligodendrocytes.

701
01:13:23,482 --> 01:13:28,386
[SPEAKER_06]: So they prevent them from actually growing and becoming fully functional.

702
01:13:29,587 --> 01:13:40,015
[SPEAKER_06]: Organophosphate flame retardants, also pervasive in the environment, were found to arrest the development of oligodendrocytes in both mice and human cortical organoids.

703
01:13:40,115 --> 01:13:41,877
[SPEAKER_06]: And these cortical organoids is a

704
01:13:42,785 --> 01:13:49,849
[SPEAKER_06]: is a new way of looking at things by actually making cells turn into little tiny organs, if you can believe that.

705
01:13:50,889 --> 01:13:52,430
[SPEAKER_06]: It does actually happen.

706
01:13:52,490 --> 01:13:56,352
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen these in the lab, so it's remarkable.

707
01:13:56,913 --> 01:14:00,895
[SPEAKER_06]: So, the associations were observed between childhood exposure

708
01:14:01,456 --> 01:14:07,059
[SPEAKER_06]: to organophosphate flame retardants and abnormal neurodevelopmental outcomes.

709
01:14:07,219 --> 01:14:17,804
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a epidemiological study that they did pursuant to the first findings of this article, and this was significant finding too.

710
01:14:19,439 --> 01:14:32,846
[SPEAKER_06]: So quaternary chemicals such as quaternary ammonium and phosphonium compound as well as organophosphate flame retardants raise potential health concerns for neurodevelopmental toxicity.

711
01:14:34,587 --> 01:14:51,403
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously, further studies are required after these findings to see what the exact exposure levels are and how much are actually present in various populations, although we already have some information on that.

712
01:14:52,624 --> 01:14:55,747
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I'm just going to go through this very fast.

713
01:14:55,907 --> 01:14:57,508
[SPEAKER_06]: Please bear with me.

714
01:14:57,868 --> 01:14:59,230
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a

715
01:15:00,807 --> 01:15:05,788
[SPEAKER_06]: Many of you might not be used to this, but I'll try to explain this as far as possible.

716
01:15:05,808 --> 01:15:09,309
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is a schematic of the primary chemical screen that they did.

717
01:15:09,349 --> 01:15:20,352
[SPEAKER_06]: So they essentially take these plates, they grow these cells inside each of these wells, and they apply separate compounds into the wells.

718
01:15:21,072 --> 01:15:32,119
[SPEAKER_06]: And what they look at is essentially the transformation of the oligodendrocyte progenitor cells to the actual oligodendrocyte, functional oligodendrocyte.

719
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:38,063
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's the primary screen, so they use it as a fixed concentration of compounds.

720
01:15:38,783 --> 01:15:46,188
[SPEAKER_06]: So 1,800 compounds all put in at 20 micromolar to see what the effect is totally before they do anything else with it.

721
01:15:47,715 --> 01:15:53,957
[SPEAKER_06]: And what they found out was that 1,462 compounds had no effect.

722
01:15:53,977 --> 01:15:56,757
[SPEAKER_06]: 292 compounds were cytotoxic.

723
01:15:57,878 --> 01:16:01,219
[SPEAKER_06]: And 47 compounds were actually inhibitors of oligodendrocytes.

724
01:16:01,859 --> 01:16:04,820
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there was also some drivers of oligodendrocytes.

725
01:16:05,940 --> 01:16:11,581
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is a viability plot versus just the number of compounds.

726
01:16:11,621 --> 01:16:14,522
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can see all the black spots at the bottom are showing

727
01:16:15,415 --> 01:16:17,276
[SPEAKER_06]: below the 50% mark.

728
01:16:17,616 --> 01:16:26,480
[SPEAKER_06]: So these compounds, these are the effect of the compounds on the bottom.

729
01:16:27,180 --> 01:16:29,281
[SPEAKER_06]: You can see there's a lot of them that are below 50%.

730
01:16:30,202 --> 01:16:39,866
[SPEAKER_06]: That means they reduce the viability of these oligodendrocytes by 50% at least, and also much more.

731
01:16:40,226 --> 01:16:41,707
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of them are way at the bottom there.

732
01:16:43,049 --> 01:16:51,771
[SPEAKER_06]: And in terms of looking at how these look at, like, if you look under a microscope and look at these cells, you can see that this is how they would look.

733
01:16:51,851 --> 01:16:53,231
[SPEAKER_06]: These are just stains.

734
01:16:53,692 --> 01:17:00,673
[SPEAKER_06]: So in the first panel up here, top left panel, you'll see the effect of no compound at all.

735
01:17:00,713 --> 01:17:02,314
[SPEAKER_06]: This is just a carrier.

736
01:17:02,334 --> 01:17:03,294
[SPEAKER_06]: This is DMSO.

737
01:17:04,174 --> 01:17:07,615
[SPEAKER_06]: And then if the compound is cytotoxic, well, this is what happens over here.

738
01:17:07,955 --> 01:17:11,916
[SPEAKER_06]: If you go to the right, if you come down to the bottom left, you'll see

739
01:17:12,636 --> 01:17:21,825
[SPEAKER_06]: inhibitor preventing the growth of oligodendrocytes, which is depicted in the lack of green color.

740
01:17:22,806 --> 01:17:25,789
[SPEAKER_06]: And here you have a driver that uses a control.

741
01:17:25,829 --> 01:17:29,593
[SPEAKER_06]: So this driver essentially increases the amount of oligodendrocytes.

742
01:17:30,705 --> 01:17:38,049
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so the most compelling part of all this data are these curves that you see over here.

743
01:17:38,569 --> 01:17:41,010
[SPEAKER_06]: These are called dose-response curves.

744
01:17:41,591 --> 01:17:45,753
[SPEAKER_06]: And I will just point out that curves that are red

745
01:17:46,676 --> 01:17:56,920
[SPEAKER_06]: represent oligodendrocytes, curves that are gray or astrocytes, another class of supporting cells in the brain.

746
01:17:57,561 --> 01:18:01,922
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, as a control, we have fibroblasts, which are essentially skin cells.

747
01:18:02,423 --> 01:18:05,744
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can see that the further left

748
01:18:06,682 --> 01:18:12,905
[SPEAKER_06]: a curve is shifted, the more sensitive that cell line is to the compound that you're putting in.

749
01:18:13,246 --> 01:18:19,169
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're essentially increasing the concentration of a compound and you're looking at the viability of those cells.

750
01:18:19,609 --> 01:18:26,913
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can see that the oligodendrocytes happen to be extremely sensitive to the presence of these compounds.

751
01:18:27,453 --> 01:18:35,618
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can see some of the median toxicity levels in the nanomolar range over here.

752
01:18:36,098 --> 01:18:37,780
[SPEAKER_06]: in these curves.

753
01:18:38,140 --> 01:18:43,726
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is my stock and trade, so I look at these curves all the time.

754
01:18:44,126 --> 01:18:53,817
[SPEAKER_06]: So I apologize if I expose you to some surprise thing.

755
01:18:54,157 --> 01:18:58,682
[SPEAKER_06]: But I hope you appreciate some of the nuances in these

756
01:19:00,097 --> 01:19:00,437
[SPEAKER_06]: curves.

757
01:19:00,937 --> 01:19:03,198
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, what are the actual findings?

758
01:19:03,218 --> 01:19:05,398
[SPEAKER_06]: So what comes out of those curves?

759
01:19:05,898 --> 01:19:10,720
[SPEAKER_06]: So these are the actual numbers that they got out of those cells.

760
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:20,442
[SPEAKER_06]: So these are these, the compounds are listed in the first column and the actual cytotoxicity that these guys measured in these assays

761
01:19:21,042 --> 01:19:31,047
[SPEAKER_06]: are listed in the second column and what the EPA considers as the cytotoxicity median of these compounds is listed in the third column.

762
01:19:31,707 --> 01:19:37,370
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's compare the first column or rather the second column to

763
01:19:38,368 --> 01:19:50,165
[SPEAKER_06]: The third column, you can see the discrepancy between what the EPA considers as the median cytotoxicity of these compounds and what how these are showing up in these assays.

764
01:19:51,807 --> 01:19:56,708
[SPEAKER_06]: And many, many times there are 100 to a tenfold difference in terms of concentration.

765
01:19:56,768 --> 01:20:10,051
[SPEAKER_06]: So this means these compounds are having an effect at far lower concentrations on the cells than the EPA thinks they have, based on the data that EPA has.

766
01:20:10,771 --> 01:20:19,153
[SPEAKER_06]: And not surprisingly, the concentrations that these guys are measuring are actually the concentrations that are found in people.

767
01:20:19,987 --> 01:20:29,181
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, at the bottom here, I've got some chemical structures of the compounds that we're all exposed to in this study.

768
01:20:29,341 --> 01:20:35,790
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, so they also did some epidemiological analysis of exposure to these

769
01:20:37,067 --> 01:20:42,575
[SPEAKER_06]: Organophosphate compounds that are used as flame retardants, and they've been lit deep.

770
01:20:42,675 --> 01:20:48,423
[SPEAKER_06]: These compounds have been linked to abnormal neuronal development for quite a while.

771
01:20:49,444 --> 01:20:52,628
[SPEAKER_06]: Remarkably, this hasn't found any traction anywhere.

772
01:20:54,593 --> 01:21:04,715
[SPEAKER_06]: And then to investigate the impact of postnatal exposure to these organophosphate compounds, they looked at data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.

773
01:21:05,035 --> 01:21:11,237
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a long study where they took a population of children.

774
01:21:12,017 --> 01:21:20,679
[SPEAKER_06]: They took samples from the children's urine, blood over many years, and these were analyzed for various compounds.

775
01:21:22,299 --> 01:21:34,822
[SPEAKER_06]: And the study analyzed, it's called the NH aims to assess childhood exposure to these flame retardants.

776
01:21:35,682 --> 01:21:40,863
[SPEAKER_06]: So they looked at a urine metabolite of these flame retardant.

777
01:21:42,203 --> 01:21:49,865
[SPEAKER_06]: And this urine metabolite is a very reliable predictor of exposure to this flame retardant.

778
01:21:51,396 --> 01:22:03,464
[SPEAKER_06]: And high levels of urinary concentrations of this metabolite were associated with increased risk of gross motor dysfunction and a need for special education.

779
01:22:04,444 --> 01:22:08,927
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, I mean, this was very concerning to me anyway.

780
01:22:09,327 --> 01:22:18,633
[SPEAKER_06]: So these findings provide strong evidence for a positive association between organophosphate frame retardant exposure and abnormal neurodevelopment.

781
01:22:20,257 --> 01:22:36,336
[SPEAKER_06]: So some more information worth knowing, and I just want to put this up because it completes the picture in a sense in terms of what is going on regulatory-wise and why we are having these compounds all over the place with nobody looking at it.

782
01:22:37,437 --> 01:22:40,059
[SPEAKER_06]: So there is something called the Toxic Substances Control Act.

783
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:42,481
[SPEAKER_06]: This was established in 1976.

784
01:22:42,761 --> 01:22:51,807
[SPEAKER_06]: It provides the APA with the authority to require reporting, record keeping, testing requirements, and restrictions on chemical substances and or mixtures.

785
01:22:53,108 --> 01:22:55,970
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, some products are generally excluded from TSCA.

786
01:22:56,050 --> 01:23:02,234
[SPEAKER_06]: This includes drugs, foods, food, drugs, cosmetics, and pesticides.

787
01:23:04,242 --> 01:23:05,122
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know why.

788
01:23:05,263 --> 01:23:07,404
[SPEAKER_06]: It's worth looking into why that is.

789
01:23:09,084 --> 01:23:22,190
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, unfortunately, this act continues to protect the chemical industry by allowing them to use toxic chemicals by grandfathering in over 80,000 chemicals, making them very hard to regulate.

790
01:23:22,891 --> 01:23:26,532
[SPEAKER_06]: So TSCA was updated in 2016 by Obama

791
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:39,265
[SPEAKER_06]: This amendment updated the requirements for testing the chemicals, increased transparency with the public, and provided more information to the public.

792
01:23:39,946 --> 01:23:49,951
[SPEAKER_06]: But the Trump administration reversed much of the progress that was made, and they delayed the strong enforcement of policies that Congress had been hoping for.

793
01:23:51,892 --> 01:23:55,774
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, EPA has been very slow to respond to all of this.

794
01:23:57,663 --> 01:24:09,952
[SPEAKER_06]: But the takeaway from this is that as of April 2023, only 1% of 84,000 chemicals in circulation have been tested for safety.

795
01:24:10,632 --> 01:24:15,516
[SPEAKER_06]: The Environmental Protection Agency has only required about 200 of these chemicals to be tested.

796
01:24:16,216 --> 01:24:24,963
[SPEAKER_06]: DAPA has said that less than 1% of more than 40,000 chemicals used in consumer products in the US

797
01:24:25,702 --> 01:24:27,784
[SPEAKER_06]: have been rigorously tested for human safety.

798
01:24:27,844 --> 01:24:30,167
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's something to really ponder.

799
01:24:31,568 --> 01:24:33,210
[SPEAKER_06]: So what can you do?

800
01:24:34,451 --> 01:24:35,452
[SPEAKER_06]: Read the product labels.

801
01:24:36,092 --> 01:24:38,635
[SPEAKER_06]: Avoid these products that contain these compounds.

802
01:24:40,957 --> 01:24:42,098
[SPEAKER_06]: Choose alternative products.

803
01:24:43,380 --> 01:24:45,742
[SPEAKER_06]: Make your own do-it-yourself cleaning solutions.

804
01:24:45,942 --> 01:24:49,125
[SPEAKER_06]: I do this at home now because of my concern.

805
01:24:49,145 --> 01:24:49,446
[SPEAKER_06]: So I

806
01:24:50,317 --> 01:24:55,524
[SPEAKER_06]: They're easy enough to make, lots of solutions, lots of recipes on the internet.

807
01:24:56,145 --> 01:24:56,986
[SPEAKER_06]: Go have a check down.

808
01:24:58,288 --> 01:25:01,272
[SPEAKER_06]: Use ventilation when you're using these chemicals.

809
01:25:02,093 --> 01:25:02,714
[SPEAKER_06]: Open the windows.

810
01:25:04,016 --> 01:25:07,120
[SPEAKER_06]: Use gloves that reduces exposure to your skin.

811
01:25:08,390 --> 01:25:09,350
[SPEAKER_06]: And research your products.

812
01:25:09,390 --> 01:25:12,611
[SPEAKER_06]: Look for safer alternatives or inquire about chemicals, use of coatings.

813
01:25:14,092 --> 01:25:16,873
[SPEAKER_06]: And don't use it if you don't need to use it.

814
01:25:17,093 --> 01:25:21,074
[SPEAKER_06]: In many cases, soap and water are just enough to do the job.

815
01:25:21,134 --> 01:25:24,395
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't need antimicrobial agents.

816
01:25:25,965 --> 01:25:35,309
[SPEAKER_06]: And then educate yourself, stay informed about potential risks with these compounds and other chemicals.

817
01:25:35,329 --> 01:25:45,233
[SPEAKER_06]: It's important to be an aware consumer because we don't know, like I said, 84,000 chemicals, 1% has only been tested for toxicity.

818
01:25:45,313 --> 01:25:48,835
[SPEAKER_06]: So you don't know what you're getting exposed to.

819
01:25:49,810 --> 01:25:56,273
[SPEAKER_06]: And lastly, and I put this up as very, very important, is to advocate for safer alternatives.

820
01:25:56,773 --> 01:26:09,800
[SPEAKER_06]: You should support and encourage the development of safer alternatives to these compounds in consumer products, and definitely call the manufacturers and regulatory authorities.

821
01:26:10,340 --> 01:26:12,801
[SPEAKER_06]: And absolutely, absolutely, this is a must.

822
01:26:13,521 --> 01:26:21,145
[SPEAKER_06]: call your federal and state representatives and say that you're concerned, this needs to be addressed.

823
01:26:22,006 --> 01:26:24,547
[SPEAKER_06]: This is potentially affecting our children.

824
01:26:24,567 --> 01:26:32,232
[SPEAKER_06]: I am convinced at this stage that it is.

825
01:26:32,392 --> 01:26:35,794
[SPEAKER_06]: So I will put that out as a scientist.

826
01:26:36,094 --> 01:26:37,515
[SPEAKER_06]: So anyway.

827
01:26:39,082 --> 01:26:43,463
[SPEAKER_06]: These are some of the references that are meant to inform and inflame you.

828
01:26:43,483 --> 01:26:52,606
[SPEAKER_06]: I sent the presentation over to Brenda, and hopefully she can post it somewhere.

829
01:26:52,786 --> 01:27:03,048
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know where it is, but these certainly will give you some initial reading and information about what the situation is.

830
01:27:03,809 --> 01:27:04,749
[SPEAKER_06]: And thank you for listening.

831
01:27:04,869 --> 01:27:05,189
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

832
01:27:07,390 --> 01:27:08,430
[SPEAKER_07]: I had a quick question.

833
01:27:09,532 --> 01:27:10,713
[SPEAKER_07]: Paul?

834
01:27:13,075 --> 01:27:13,596
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

835
01:27:13,736 --> 01:27:19,521
[SPEAKER_07]: You used the term association as opposed to causation.

836
01:27:20,902 --> 01:27:31,271
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that because of sample size issues or what are the reasons that you're talking about associations instead of causations?

837
01:27:32,067 --> 01:27:47,740
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, in order to, in order to, like, definitively say that something is caused by something, but you have to have vast epidemiological data, right?

838
01:27:49,355 --> 01:27:55,737
[SPEAKER_06]: And to gain this kind of information takes years and years and years.

839
01:27:56,297 --> 01:28:03,459
[SPEAKER_06]: And there is no, you know, there's no, a lot of times you'll find that there is no impetus to do that.

840
01:28:05,580 --> 01:28:08,881
[SPEAKER_06]: Funding is not available for these large epidemiological studies.

841
01:28:10,582 --> 01:28:14,803
[SPEAKER_06]: There is some resistance from interested parties that this doesn't happen.

842
01:28:16,123 --> 01:28:28,207
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, there is, you know, so that that in so ascribing of ascribing causation is a is a bigger hurdle.

843
01:28:28,887 --> 01:28:37,390
[SPEAKER_06]: But I you can see that there are various tricks to get around that by doing these kinds of studies that they're doing.

844
01:28:39,377 --> 01:28:51,280
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's important to understand that these are, you know, we try to model complex systems in a reduced way.

845
01:28:51,940 --> 01:28:54,400
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is one of those ways that they've done that.

846
01:28:54,760 --> 01:28:58,581
[SPEAKER_06]: And like I said, it's very compelling data for me.

847
01:28:58,601 --> 01:29:02,282
[SPEAKER_06]: It's important to understand that this is

848
01:29:02,802 --> 01:29:03,222
[SPEAKER_06]: going on.

849
01:29:03,963 --> 01:29:14,747
[SPEAKER_06]: There's been many, many, like the effect on oligodendrocytes by flame retardants, for instance, has been looked at before.

850
01:29:14,847 --> 01:29:27,312
[SPEAKER_06]: Developmental problems with kids exposed to these chemicals have been, there is increasing amounts of epidemiological data that suggests this is happening.

851
01:29:27,792 --> 01:29:29,093
[SPEAKER_06]: So it is time

852
01:29:29,713 --> 01:29:30,653
[SPEAKER_06]: for regulation.

853
01:29:30,873 --> 01:29:35,875
[SPEAKER_06]: It is time to really deeply think about this and do something about this.

854
01:29:38,776 --> 01:29:39,316
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, Paul.

855
01:29:47,959 --> 01:29:49,379
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll stop sharing my screen.

856
01:29:53,220 --> 01:29:54,320
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a question.

857
01:29:54,421 --> 01:29:55,061
[SPEAKER_11]: I usually

858
01:29:58,237 --> 01:30:09,968
[SPEAKER_11]: for those of us who are not scientists, even those of us who are not scientists but have been fairly steeped in sciences, there's been a

859
01:30:11,813 --> 01:30:23,344
[SPEAKER_11]: popularized association between flame retardants, PFAS, and all sorts of physiological problems.

860
01:30:25,046 --> 01:30:28,229
[SPEAKER_11]: What is the relationship between PFAS and these classes of chemicals?

861
01:30:28,249 --> 01:30:29,730
[SPEAKER_11]: That's part A of the question.

862
01:30:29,771 --> 01:30:31,432
[SPEAKER_11]: And part B of the question is,

863
01:30:32,994 --> 01:30:47,712
[SPEAKER_11]: Avoiding these chemicals is easier to say if you know what the chemicals are, but I haven't a clue what I'm looking for if I were to look at an ingredients label and what to avoid.

864
01:30:48,717 --> 01:30:49,457
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

865
01:30:50,858 --> 01:30:55,999
[SPEAKER_06]: You can get a listing of the quats just by doing a Google search.

866
01:30:56,399 --> 01:31:08,422
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll tell you what these compounds are and what to look for if you look at the labels of these compounds.

867
01:31:09,282 --> 01:31:13,823
[SPEAKER_06]: They're very, very promiscuously used in cleaning products.

868
01:31:15,763 --> 01:31:17,764
[SPEAKER_06]: And there is

869
01:31:18,470 --> 01:31:39,909
[SPEAKER_06]: uh you certainly and there is obviously laws now too that you have to list all your ingredients in on a on a on a on a chemical product so definitely look for what uh there's a quaternary ammonium compound as for flame retardants well they're a little bit harder to uh list because they're not

870
01:31:40,517 --> 01:31:41,537
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not actually listed.

871
01:31:41,637 --> 01:31:45,459
[SPEAKER_06]: You find them in almost everything, any plastic toys that are made.

872
01:31:46,999 --> 01:32:08,407
[SPEAKER_06]: Even remarkably, I found out that there is an act that requires that children's pajamas have flame retardant in them between the four months and 14 months or something like that.

873
01:32:10,458 --> 01:32:13,262
[SPEAKER_06]: It's absolutely remarkable that that's there.

874
01:32:14,204 --> 01:32:15,786
[SPEAKER_06]: That was passed, I think, in 1977 or something.

875
01:32:20,582 --> 01:32:42,155
[SPEAKER_06]: It's hard to find where those flame retardants have been used, but it's important, I think, for us to pressure the powers that are to make sure that any product that goes out is listed with the ingredients that are used to make them.

876
01:32:43,436 --> 01:32:54,766
[SPEAKER_06]: particularly plastic toys, particularly garments and clothing that are made for kids, because oligodendrocytes are actually part of a developing brain.

877
01:32:55,887 --> 01:33:02,613
[SPEAKER_06]: They support the structurization of brain areas and they

878
01:33:03,326 --> 01:33:10,888
[SPEAKER_06]: Any kind of material that interferes with that obviously has consequences for the child growing up.

879
01:33:11,868 --> 01:33:28,293
[SPEAKER_06]: As for the PFAS compounds, they are also, you can look that up on Google and see where they are, but I can tell you that most non-stick, you know,

880
01:33:30,343 --> 01:33:32,224
[SPEAKER_06]: cookware contains those.

881
01:33:32,925 --> 01:33:49,253
[SPEAKER_06]: And so if you cook with that, and particularly you use grease to, you know, make your fries or, you know, do some Chinese cooking with a nonstick pot, then you're getting exposed to that.

882
01:33:50,053 --> 01:33:52,054
[SPEAKER_06]: They're also pleasant in some cleaners.

883
01:33:53,735 --> 01:33:55,736
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's that very, very much.

884
01:33:58,568 --> 01:34:13,187
[SPEAKER_06]: ubiquitous chemicals and they are involved, more and more information is coming out about these chemicals, the PFAS being connected to immune dysfunction and

885
01:34:15,990 --> 01:34:19,113
[SPEAKER_06]: endocrine dysfunction in people.

886
01:34:20,274 --> 01:34:30,204
[SPEAKER_06]: So some of the effects that we see in, let's say, sperm accounts going down all over the planet,

887
01:34:32,096 --> 01:34:38,101
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't know yet, but there are some indications that there might be some connectivity there.

888
01:34:38,801 --> 01:34:43,685
[SPEAKER_06]: But that has to be researched much further.

889
01:34:45,267 --> 01:34:54,534
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's important for us to know what... My point in doing this is that we're just exposed to a lot of stuff that we don't know anything about.

890
01:34:56,229 --> 01:35:04,316
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's high time we just started paying attention to this, because it's taking a toll.

891
01:35:13,324 --> 01:35:15,226
[SPEAKER_01]: I see a couple of raised hands here.

892
01:35:15,246 --> 01:35:17,148
[SPEAKER_09]: Martha, you were first.

893
01:35:17,408 --> 01:35:17,748
[SPEAKER_09]: Go ahead.

894
01:35:19,009 --> 01:35:19,350
[SPEAKER_09]: Or Barry.

895
01:35:20,750 --> 01:35:21,531
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, thank you.

896
01:35:21,631 --> 01:35:23,493
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Paul, for the presentation.

897
01:35:24,313 --> 01:35:30,259
[SPEAKER_02]: In my day job, I work on PFAS and its removal from drinking water.

898
01:35:30,640 --> 01:35:32,601
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would agree.

899
01:35:33,082 --> 01:35:43,092
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look to Europe or even California, you can find lists of banned chemicals or regulated chemicals that are not regulated in the US by the EPA.

900
01:35:44,054 --> 01:35:44,474
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

901
01:35:45,074 --> 01:36:07,264
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it would be a good project of this group and I would volunteer for it to put together a list of sites or databases like the environmental working groups database where people can turn to learn more about these chemicals and how to avoid them.

902
01:36:08,005 --> 01:36:12,547
[SPEAKER_02]: Because as you pointed out, it's extremely difficult to do.

903
01:36:14,291 --> 01:36:24,244
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, they've been used so ubiquitously in almost everything that we touch and use every day.

904
01:36:24,264 --> 01:36:26,347
[SPEAKER_06]: They're present everywhere.

905
01:36:26,908 --> 01:36:29,892
[SPEAKER_06]: So even remote populations that have no

906
01:36:31,321 --> 01:36:37,924
[SPEAKER_06]: you would think that have no contact with these kinds of chemicals have been shown to have them in their blood.

907
01:36:38,064 --> 01:36:39,784
[SPEAKER_06]: So they get everywhere.

908
01:36:40,245 --> 01:36:46,847
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's important to find out how we can avoid them and mitigate it somehow.

909
01:36:55,610 --> 01:36:57,091
[SPEAKER_10]: Dan, did you still have something you wanted to add?

910
01:36:58,647 --> 01:37:00,588
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I think Barry had his hand up.

911
01:37:02,990 --> 01:37:03,971
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I was applauding.

912
01:37:05,191 --> 01:37:06,212
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

913
01:37:06,272 --> 01:37:08,193
[SPEAKER_09]: Really quick, I just wanted to add one thing.

914
01:37:08,794 --> 01:37:24,484
[SPEAKER_09]: If I remember correctly, last year, maybe it's yearly, there's a hazardous chemical pick-up or drop-off that they did at the James Street DPW lot.

915
01:37:25,637 --> 01:37:35,745
[SPEAKER_09]: I know myself, I brought a whole bunch of stuff over there that was just unlabeled chemicals in jars that were in my basement when I moved into my house.

916
01:37:36,366 --> 01:37:48,075
[SPEAKER_09]: I think in Medford especially, there's a lot of old houses, there's a lot of old chemicals, a lot of old stuff sitting around that might have something to do with this, but also just is hazardous in general.

917
01:37:48,095 --> 01:37:53,179
[SPEAKER_09]: I would suggest that we put some either educational or

918
01:37:55,423 --> 01:38:11,709
[SPEAKER_09]: call it person power, behind helping people dispose of chemicals that are in their houses to mitigate this, I think would be a great place for this committee and for Medford to get involved with this.

919
01:38:13,050 --> 01:38:13,810
[SPEAKER_06]: I completely agree.

920
01:38:14,090 --> 01:38:16,371
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's start something going.

921
01:38:17,772 --> 01:38:19,692
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, let's keep in touch.

922
01:38:21,778 --> 01:38:27,823
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, if folks are interested in reviving something like that, I would suggest talking to the DPW about that.

923
01:38:28,663 --> 01:38:33,647
[SPEAKER_01]: They're the ones who held the hazardous waste drop off last year.

924
01:38:40,312 --> 01:38:42,714
[SPEAKER_06]: Barry, cast iron is king.

925
01:38:51,940 --> 01:38:52,180
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

926
01:38:52,240 --> 01:38:53,681
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not seeing any more hands.

927
01:38:54,902 --> 01:38:55,803
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks again, Paul.

928
01:38:56,083 --> 01:39:01,087
[SPEAKER_10]: I realize I rushed you a little, but I'm glad we could fit you in.

929
01:39:01,588 --> 01:39:02,428
[SPEAKER_10]: This is well worth it.

930
01:39:03,970 --> 01:39:04,210
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

931
01:39:04,250 --> 01:39:05,371
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for your time, everyone.

932
01:39:05,391 --> 01:39:07,913
[SPEAKER_06]: Appreciate it.

933
01:39:08,573 --> 01:39:08,973
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

934
01:39:09,914 --> 01:39:14,398
[SPEAKER_10]: We will breeze through if there's any new business people would like to introduce.

935
01:39:19,292 --> 01:39:22,133
[SPEAKER_05]: Ready said you had 2 sentences on the tree ordinance.

936
01:39:23,014 --> 01:39:23,654
[SPEAKER_10]: I would love to hear.

937
01:39:26,536 --> 01:39:32,578
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, so that the tree ordinance drafts are still being worked on probably completed within the next month.

938
01:39:34,139 --> 01:39:39,922
[SPEAKER_01]: And last week trees Medford distributed along with the mystic River watershed Association.

939
01:39:39,942 --> 01:39:48,026
[SPEAKER_01]: 54 free shade trees to residents in the hottest areas of Medford to help reduce heat island effects.

940
01:39:50,645 --> 01:39:51,485
[SPEAKER_10]: That's fantastic.

941
01:39:56,567 --> 01:39:57,967
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a really nice update.

942
01:40:01,868 --> 01:40:02,228
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

943
01:40:02,469 --> 01:40:02,909
[SPEAKER_10]: Any others?

944
01:40:07,090 --> 01:40:14,332
[SPEAKER_10]: Seeing none, I would entertain a motion to adjourn.

945
01:40:17,333 --> 01:40:17,653
[SPEAKER_06]: I second.

946
01:40:22,448 --> 01:40:23,789
[SPEAKER_06]: Did I get this wrong again?

947
01:40:23,869 --> 01:40:26,491
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll make a motion to adjourn.

948
01:40:29,774 --> 01:40:30,274
[SPEAKER_06]: I stink.

949
01:40:33,336 --> 01:40:34,417
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to get it one day.

950
01:40:37,960 --> 01:40:39,801
[SPEAKER_10]: But with that, I see two.

951
01:40:39,821 --> 01:40:42,263
[SPEAKER_01]: All in favor?

952
01:40:43,024 --> 01:40:43,724
[SPEAKER_10]: All in favor?

953
01:40:44,465 --> 01:40:44,585
[SPEAKER_01]: Aye.

954
01:40:44,825 --> 01:40:44,965
[SPEAKER_01]: Aye.

955
01:40:46,681 --> 01:40:47,343
[SPEAKER_10]: The ayes have it.

956
01:40:49,388 --> 01:40:53,799
[SPEAKER_10]: This has been a very busy session, so I appreciate you all and your time.

957
01:40:54,902 --> 01:40:59,734
[SPEAKER_10]: And I believe I will see you all May 6th.

958
01:40:59,754 --> 01:41:01,338
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll be hearing from Senator Barrett.

959
01:41:02,942 --> 01:41:03,924
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Will.

960
01:41:04,445 --> 01:41:05,247
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, everybody.

961
01:41:05,287 --> 01:41:05,488
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye-bye.
