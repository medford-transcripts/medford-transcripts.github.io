1
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:21,491
Hey, everybody.

2
00:04:31,443 --> 00:04:33,366
Mr. Clerk, give me a heads up when we're ready to go.

3
00:04:50,848 --> 00:04:53,951
Mr. President, I am all set whenever you are all set.

4
00:04:55,192 --> 00:04:58,374
Great, and we're good on the Medford Community Media side as well?

5
00:04:59,956 --> 00:05:05,461
Medford Community Media is on, and they are, so I know that they are on.

6
00:05:06,662 --> 00:05:06,982
Great.

7
00:05:09,604 --> 00:05:10,745
Because I see them in the room.

8
00:05:12,126 --> 00:05:12,847
Fantastic.

9
00:05:16,061 --> 00:05:16,962
All right, then.

10
00:05:17,402 --> 00:05:25,648
I don't see the council booth account in there yet, but I do see the Medford Community Media.

11
00:05:25,668 --> 00:05:27,290
So I think we're good to go on that one.

12
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:32,153
Yeah, I think they probably don't need the booth for the Zoom meeting, I think, if I remember correctly.

13
00:05:32,233 --> 00:05:33,014
So we should be all right.

14
00:05:33,034 --> 00:05:33,835
I think that's correct.

15
00:05:36,517 --> 00:05:38,778
All right, well, last meeting of the year.

16
00:05:38,798 --> 00:05:39,439
Hi, everybody.

17
00:05:39,499 --> 00:05:40,540
Thank you for being here.

18
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,242
We'll get going right now.

19
00:05:44,209 --> 00:05:46,970
Medford City Council, Committee of the Whole, December 18th, 2024.

20
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:48,651
It's a call to order.

21
00:05:48,691 --> 00:05:49,732
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

22
00:05:52,053 --> 00:05:52,793
Councilor Callahan.

23
00:05:53,153 --> 00:05:53,413
Present.

24
00:05:54,194 --> 00:05:55,114
Vice President Collins.

25
00:05:55,574 --> 00:05:55,874
Present.

26
00:05:56,735 --> 00:05:57,615
Councilor Lozaro.

27
00:05:57,955 --> 00:05:58,316
Present.

28
00:05:58,936 --> 00:05:59,576
Councilor Lemming.

29
00:06:00,176 --> 00:06:00,617
Present.

30
00:06:01,677 --> 00:06:02,498
Councilor Scarpelli.

31
00:06:05,139 --> 00:06:06,399
I don't see Councilor Scarpelli.

32
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:07,400
Councilor Sang.

33
00:06:09,921 --> 00:06:10,921
I don't see Councilor Sang either.

34
00:06:10,961 --> 00:06:11,482
President Behrs.

35
00:06:12,284 --> 00:06:14,946
present, five present, two absent, the meeting is called to order.

36
00:06:15,727 --> 00:06:18,769
There'll be a meeting of the Medford City Council Committee of the Whole at 6 p.m.

37
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:21,452
on December 18th, 2024 via Zoom only.

38
00:06:22,372 --> 00:06:32,461
The action and discussion item for this meeting is paper 24-006, which is a review of the 2024-2025 Council Governing Agenda.

39
00:06:33,702 --> 00:06:34,543
So we'll take that up.

40
00:06:36,444 --> 00:06:38,786
At our first regular meeting, January 9th, 2024,

41
00:06:40,616 --> 00:06:46,522
We resolved that counselors would submit items to create a governing agenda document based on a draft template.

42
00:06:47,363 --> 00:06:56,772
We then met on January 24th, 2024 to review the governing agenda and refer it out to each of the committees.

43
00:06:57,732 --> 00:07:04,499
And we also made a motion to have reviews in June and December and to review the governing agenda regularly.

44
00:07:05,988 --> 00:07:26,886
And pursuant to those motions, we held the committee of the whole, I believe in June, and now we're having one in December to review progress to date, to suggest updates to the document, and to send a link to resident services and public engagement committee to be included in the January newsletter, the updated document.

45
00:07:26,906 --> 00:07:31,209
I wanna thank Vice President Collins for working on the updated document with me.

46
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:33,091
Folks can find it

47
00:07:34,045 --> 00:07:35,586
at a link that I'll post in the chat.

48
00:07:35,886 --> 00:07:43,371
It's also available on the city website, but it is also on the council portal.

49
00:07:44,092 --> 00:07:48,034
And this is as of Monday when the agenda went out.

50
00:07:48,254 --> 00:07:52,337
So again, thank you, Vice President Collins for your work on this with me.

51
00:07:53,418 --> 00:08:00,002
And I think we can either start with any comments or questions from councillors, and then we can

52
00:08:00,796 --> 00:08:06,522
quickly go through and review highlights from each committee so far this year and what's coming up for the next year.

53
00:08:08,524 --> 00:08:12,388
With that, I'm happy to go to Vice President Collins if there's anything you'd like to add.

54
00:08:15,932 --> 00:08:16,192
Thank you.

55
00:08:20,376 --> 00:08:34,306
I think this is, I'm just really grateful for the opportunity that the governing agenda and the biannual review presents us with to take a step back and look at the year in total.

56
00:08:34,686 --> 00:08:44,352
I know that for myself, it's really easy to get caught up in the day-to-day, week-to-week, month-to-month work and lose track of

57
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:55,335
kind of a big picture of which big projects have advanced incrementally, which things have come together over the course of a lot of months of work.

58
00:08:55,455 --> 00:09:05,825
I also find that it's really easy to forget about things that we did, substantive as they may be, because this Council has been extraordinarily productive, busy, and prolific.

59
00:09:06,426 --> 00:09:09,909
And I thank all of my colleagues for collaborating to make that

60
00:09:10,855 --> 00:09:11,436
The reality.

61
00:09:11,456 --> 00:09:20,043
This is just my second term on the city council, but our committees have been much more active than they ever have been in the past.

62
00:09:20,103 --> 00:09:26,128
I think that every counselor has been really diligent about Using the committee structure to make sure that

63
00:09:28,672 --> 00:09:42,677
We articulated big goals in the governing agenda at the beginning of this year, and we've been very thorough about meeting on those and pushing forward our priorities in our various public meetings systemically.

64
00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:54,502
And I think that a lot of that progress, at least for me as an individual, would actually be pretty hard to just get a bird's eye view on if not for this document so that we can compare

65
00:09:55,342 --> 00:10:03,130
Kind of our goals and hopes and dreams and plans January version to where we are 11 months later.

66
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:11,018
So I'm just, I'm really grateful for this format, which allows us to kind of compare how we started and what we've made progress on and even the projects that we've completed.

67
00:10:11,038 --> 00:10:11,098
And

68
00:10:14,611 --> 00:10:22,179
really grateful to my colleagues for their work on our shared larger projects and our individual projects that different people have taken point on.

69
00:10:22,199 --> 00:10:32,149
You know, all of the projects in the governing agenda come from things that we heard from the community, things from our constituents, things that people in the community wanted to see, want us to see us working on.

70
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:34,171
That's why we're here.

71
00:10:34,191 --> 00:10:34,931
That's why we do this.

72
00:10:35,472 --> 00:10:38,355
And I'm really glad that we have a document that we could point to and say

73
00:10:38,895 --> 00:10:40,437
This is why this was a goal.

74
00:10:40,457 --> 00:10:41,479
This is why this is a goal.

75
00:10:41,899 --> 00:10:43,662
And this is what this is what we're working on.

76
00:10:43,682 --> 00:10:45,444
And this is why this is why we're working for you.

77
00:10:46,405 --> 00:10:47,867
And I think that's really important.

78
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:49,990
You know, in our.

79
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:58,537
And then the word gets used a lot, but I think it really is a valuable goal to try to make the work of the council more transparent.

80
00:10:58,597 --> 00:11:04,302
And to me, that just means using more and better tools and language to describe to people what it is that we do in meetings.

81
00:11:05,103 --> 00:11:09,707
This is a way to break it down and show people how long it takes to get from A to B on a variety of things.

82
00:11:11,589 --> 00:11:15,793
So looking forward to just a quick review tonight, and then we'll do that again in six months.

83
00:11:16,534 --> 00:11:16,754
Thank you.

84
00:11:18,186 --> 00:11:19,648
Thank you, Vice President Collins.

85
00:11:19,788 --> 00:11:22,251
I'll recognize Councilor Callahan in just a moment.

86
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:37,128
And just wanted to note, you know, throughout this project, this meeting, if folks have amendments that they'd like to make or edits, or if they want to submit edits subsequent to the meeting, we can update the document a little further before it goes out with the newsletter in January.

87
00:11:37,629 --> 00:11:38,210
Councilor Callahan.

88
00:11:39,909 --> 00:11:40,189
Thank you.

89
00:11:40,289 --> 00:11:43,431
I also just wanted to say that very few cities do this.

90
00:11:43,591 --> 00:11:48,455
Very few cities have a document where you can actually see what are the goals?

91
00:11:48,695 --> 00:11:55,259
What is the, not just a pure value statement vision, but what are the actual policies that we're trying to pass?

92
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:59,942
And I just want to thank whoever came up with this idea, because I think it's really brilliant.

93
00:12:00,243 --> 00:12:06,227
And to be able to have it visible to the public, and then we go over it in public meetings, I think is crucial.

94
00:12:06,367 --> 00:12:07,948
And like you said, great for transparency.

95
00:12:07,988 --> 00:12:09,809
So thank you to everyone who put it together.

96
00:12:13,371 --> 00:12:14,292
Vice President Collins.

97
00:12:14,772 --> 00:12:17,914
Thank you, and I'll just take that opportunity to note that it was President Behrs' idea.

98
00:12:19,855 --> 00:12:20,195
Thanks.

99
00:12:20,336 --> 00:12:35,045
I wasn't going to take credit, and I really do feel like it's a team effort, but, you know, working with my colleagues over the past few years and seeing what I thought and then working with everyone in this council to implement some changes around

100
00:12:35,905 --> 00:12:47,829
this document, creating a committee structure that really focused on being functional and effective and aligning with how the city works was a major priority at the beginning of the term.

101
00:12:47,889 --> 00:12:48,989
And I think it's gone well.

102
00:12:49,009 --> 00:12:58,813
I am going to note some unexpected things that we've learned so far and just ways to think about this going forward.

103
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:02,914
But overall, I'm really just proud of this council and the work that we've done.

104
00:13:04,176 --> 00:13:04,856
putting it out there.

105
00:13:04,876 --> 00:13:06,857
I totally agree with you, Councilor Callahan.

106
00:13:07,597 --> 00:13:25,144
Having this document and being able to point to a single document, yeah, it's a little long and sometimes a little wordy and maybe a little wonky, but to say here's what we're doing and it's actually comprehensive is groundbreaking in my opinion.

107
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:41,179
All right, well, we can start I just want to, I'll do a quick screen share and if folks, you know, want me to do that when they're talking about their committees or any other point I'm happy to do it but just wanted to let people see kind of the form of this document.

108
00:13:41,299 --> 00:13:45,602
So, this is the front cover page with all our lovely names on it.

109
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:52,905
City Seal, but there's this great table of contents and luckily our new portal even makes it linkable.

110
00:13:52,945 --> 00:14:00,853
You can click into each different section, starting with a helpful document section, and then it's broken down by each of our committees.

111
00:14:00,933 --> 00:14:06,919
Our Committee of the Whole, Administration and Finance Committee, our Education and Culture Committee,

112
00:14:07,506 --> 00:14:21,558
the Governance Committee, Planning and Permitting Committee, which has been particularly prolific, and as well as our Public Health and Community Safety Committee, Public Works and Facilities Committee, and the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee.

113
00:14:21,578 --> 00:14:24,661
And within each of those sections, there is a

114
00:14:25,438 --> 00:14:39,250
kind of broken down in three ways, some major projects that the committee is working on, some ordinances that the committee is working on, and then some of the oversight and engagement work that committees do as part of their task.

115
00:14:40,491 --> 00:14:43,534
So I'll start with our helpful documents.

116
00:14:43,554 --> 00:14:52,661
This is just a great place to find just a few quick links to some of the major plans and things that we reference regularly in our meetings.

117
00:14:53,837 --> 00:15:10,180
are not just our committees and their members, but the city's ordinance, the code, as well as the major plan governing a lot of what we're doing around the city comprehensive plan, talking about zoning and built environment and what the vision for the community is over the next 30 years.

118
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:19,062
Housing production plan, how we're trying to produce more housing so that people who live here can stay here and people who want to live here can move here.

119
00:15:19,082 --> 00:15:23,423
A climate action and adaptation plan to address the climate crisis,

120
00:15:24,574 --> 00:15:26,275
and our open space and recreation plan.

121
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:35,060
And I'm hoping we can get some more documents linked in here in the future as well as they are developed.

122
00:15:37,381 --> 00:15:51,710
Our committee of the whole, which I chair, but as a committee of all seven councilors has had a lot of meetings, but mostly those are meetings to review papers from the mayor or to review things that have been reported out of another committee.

123
00:15:52,835 --> 00:15:56,837
order review kind of ad hoc resolutions that are coming up during the year.

124
00:15:57,338 --> 00:16:06,982
But we did have two projects in committee of the whole term started the tree preservation protection and replacement ordinances and our food truck ordinance.

125
00:16:07,963 --> 00:16:09,684
We have held meetings on those this year.

126
00:16:09,704 --> 00:16:15,647
Food truck ordinance we are hoping to incorporate some significant legal feedback.

127
00:16:15,707 --> 00:16:19,649
We definitely learned a lot about the laws around food trucks and our meeting on that this year.

128
00:16:20,707 --> 00:16:37,238
And the tree ordinance we met on in November and the tree ordinances, the public tree ordinance and the tree committee ordinance are awaiting some review by city staff as well as some counselors before coming back to the council committee of the whole.

129
00:16:37,258 --> 00:16:44,863
And then the private tree ordinance is going to be reviewed by city staff and incorporated also into our

130
00:16:46,516 --> 00:16:50,217
or at least reviewed by our zoning consultant because that is mainly a zoning ordinance.

131
00:16:50,317 --> 00:16:55,818
So that is being, we're taking advantage of the resources that we have around zoning to review the private tree ordinance.

132
00:16:56,338 --> 00:17:14,183
And the goal is really to get this done early in 2025 so that we can get these ordinances on the books and update our public tree ordinance and get a workable private tree ordinance in place so that we can stop losing trees and hopefully start growing our tree canopy again.

133
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:31,091
So that's Committee of the Whole, happy to, it's an easy one, happy to pause there and if anyone has any comments or anything they want to add on the Committee of the Whole before moving to the next committee.

134
00:17:36,815 --> 00:17:40,937
Seeing none, I will also take on the next committee, which is our Administration and Finance Committee.

135
00:17:41,938 --> 00:17:43,819
This hasn't met as much as

136
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:47,751
I had initially thought and it's kind of one of those lessons learned.

137
00:17:48,252 --> 00:17:54,814
I think a lot of what this committee nominally is responsible for is our things that we've been doing in committee of the whole.

138
00:17:56,255 --> 00:17:59,156
There have certainly been a few meetings on more on the ordinance level.

139
00:18:00,017 --> 00:18:06,539
But, you know, we have our annual budget process every year that happens mostly in committee of the whole meetings.

140
00:18:08,982 --> 00:18:16,309
And we are now going to be in our second year of an annual budget process guided by our first ever budget ordinance, which is really exciting.

141
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:30,883
As folks noted, there were some dates in the meeting schedules for the upcoming six months around the budget, including getting some of our budget recommendations in early March per the budget ordinance.

142
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:39,106
And we did work on a major project around the Proposition 2.5 overrides.

143
00:18:39,146 --> 00:18:52,678
We had our first ever override process this year, and since Proposition 2.5 went into effect nearly 50 years ago, and the passage of Questions 7 and 8 is really significant for our public schools and our DPW.

144
00:18:52,938 --> 00:18:56,862
So that's going to be a part of our budget process for the first time this year.

145
00:18:57,939 --> 00:19:04,380
working, you know, we have we did appropriate the funds for the DPW sidewalk and street repair crew to bring that back in house.

146
00:19:05,521 --> 00:19:17,303
Certainly won't fix every street and sidewalk, but it's good to have a team in the DPW dedicated to this and the staffing restored for this function, which is really a basic essential function.

147
00:19:19,064 --> 00:19:20,144
And we have the

148
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:32,882
certainly that we will hear from our Medford public schools, the school committee will be working on implementing their supplemental budget this year and then working on their budget process for fiscal 26.

149
00:19:32,962 --> 00:19:39,323
And, you know, our role in that is just to approve the allocation and they approve the expenses.

150
00:19:39,443 --> 00:19:46,985
But I know that it's going to be a really impactful year in our public schools because of the funds that are going to be available for them.

151
00:19:48,223 --> 00:19:49,684
So that's exciting around the budget.

152
00:19:50,144 --> 00:19:55,207
I talked again a lot about the revenue generation project and proposition two and a half.

153
00:19:56,007 --> 00:20:02,130
We were able to complete, you know, at least a piece of that project this year around the overrides.

154
00:20:03,951 --> 00:20:15,578
And, you know, I think revenue generation outside of proposition two and a half is always a focus of the council, especially when it comes to economic development, as well as just updating our

155
00:20:16,721 --> 00:20:17,941
city's ordinances.

156
00:20:18,181 --> 00:20:28,324
I really want to thank Councillor Lemming for leading on linkage fees, hopeful that we'll be able to meet on updating the fee schedule for the city early this year.

157
00:20:28,364 --> 00:20:42,767
That was a big call as well from the council earlier this year, just so that we're not 30 years out of date on inflation, which we have been on way too many things in the city for a long time.

158
00:20:44,448 --> 00:20:45,669
I'll just move quickly through the rest.

159
00:20:45,749 --> 00:20:50,731
Another project that we talked about was the classification and compensation study implementation.

160
00:20:52,171 --> 00:21:07,278
We were hoping to get started on this many months ago, but we have not received any sort of document or really even any sort of update from the city administration on when we can expect to be updating the city's personnel ordinance and looking at this.

161
00:21:07,418 --> 00:21:12,160
So I'm going to be checking back in with the administration in the new year on that.

162
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:14,021
And I will go to Councilor Callahan.

163
00:21:15,262 --> 00:21:16,562
Oh, I said they just had a question.

164
00:21:17,683 --> 00:21:19,063
What is the appropriate next step?

165
00:21:19,203 --> 00:21:22,044
I don't think it's a huge rush, but I would love to see that.

166
00:21:23,344 --> 00:21:25,324
So it sounds like you're going to check in with them.

167
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:27,345
Just was curious about what the next step is.

168
00:21:28,545 --> 00:21:33,986
Yeah, our role is really to we have to update the personal ordinance.

169
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:41,788
That's how the so that element of it around compensation and changes to the different classifications.

170
00:21:43,214 --> 00:21:46,515
in that ordinance, that would all have to come to us.

171
00:21:46,655 --> 00:21:53,717
So I think the next step is we need to see what those recommendations were and then discuss those changes.

172
00:21:54,378 --> 00:21:57,519
And I think it's a big project.

173
00:21:57,559 --> 00:21:59,819
I think we should take due diligence and time with it.

174
00:21:59,899 --> 00:22:04,581
But really, the next step is that we need to have the administration

175
00:22:05,976 --> 00:22:14,601
let us know if that study is completed, if there's a document, some sort of implementation recommendation from the Collins Center, and then look at that from there.

176
00:22:16,322 --> 00:22:18,664
So, we'll see.

177
00:22:18,684 --> 00:22:24,868
Great, and it sounds like you're willing to at least just ping them and see what the update is.

178
00:22:24,888 --> 00:22:26,349
Yeah, absolutely, yeah.

179
00:22:26,989 --> 00:22:31,552
I'll get in touch with them and let them know it's something we want to work on this year, this upcoming year.

180
00:22:33,897 --> 00:22:35,498
mentioned the linkage fee project.

181
00:22:35,578 --> 00:22:47,742
We have a home rule petition in at the State House to update the linkage fee ordinance and allow for regular updates to our linkage fees.

182
00:22:48,903 --> 00:22:52,344
And I believe also then we would look at an updated linkage fee ordinance.

183
00:22:52,564 --> 00:22:55,205
I don't know if Councilor Lemming, you want to talk any more about that?

184
00:22:55,265 --> 00:22:56,966
You were really leading that project.

185
00:22:59,187 --> 00:23:00,087
Sure.

186
00:23:01,408 --> 00:23:01,628
So

187
00:23:02,924 --> 00:23:12,531
Right now, they're the two moving parts that are first the homeworld petition going into the State House, which.

188
00:23:14,304 --> 00:23:19,269
I believe they should be hopefully submitted when they convene.

189
00:23:19,289 --> 00:23:24,474
And then if it gets approved, it will allow the city to do those regular updates.

190
00:23:24,995 --> 00:23:34,264
The other part of that is we were advised by the planning department that

191
00:23:35,752 --> 00:23:50,806
It would be best to finish the affordable housing nexus studies before we went forward with actually updating leakage fee ordinance to include a direct link to the affordable housing trust and as I explained there are some

192
00:23:51,546 --> 00:23:52,807
legal reasons behind that.

193
00:23:52,847 --> 00:24:00,973
So if the ordinance were passed before there was a study justifying it, then it could be struck down in court.

194
00:24:01,033 --> 00:24:04,896
So the draft language for that is all finished.

195
00:24:05,676 --> 00:24:06,537
It's all completed.

196
00:24:07,257 --> 00:24:11,841
I've been corresponding with the mayor and she's getting the money

197
00:24:13,341 --> 00:24:23,284
she's told me to actually fund this $80,000 Nexus study to put money from the Capital Improvements Program into the Affordable Housing Trust.

198
00:24:23,324 --> 00:24:31,366
And then once that's underway, we could just officially pass the edits, which again, have already been discussed extensively in committee.

199
00:24:33,707 --> 00:24:36,148
Great, thank you, Councilor Lemming for that update.

200
00:24:37,008 --> 00:24:40,369
And the Home Rule petition did end up getting submitted

201
00:24:41,318 --> 00:24:44,661
Uh, this session so and I actually did have a little correspondence.

202
00:24:44,761 --> 00:24:50,806
I'm slightly hopeful it might end up in an end of year omnibus bill or a local, uh, home rule petitions package.

203
00:24:50,967 --> 00:24:57,692
Um, so Maybe we'll we'll have some good news on that before January 1st.

204
00:24:57,912 --> 00:25:03,137
We'll see Great Um

205
00:25:03,595 --> 00:25:10,258
We also worked on maximizing tax exemptions that are allowed by the state to maximize those.

206
00:25:10,278 --> 00:25:21,422
I really want to thank Councilor Lemming on both the MGL Chapter 59, Section 5, Clause 22G, as well as adopting provisions of the HERO Act.

207
00:25:22,343 --> 00:25:33,327
That is something we are always looking for to make sure that our residents have the most opportunities under state law for exemptions from the property tax.

208
00:25:35,694 --> 00:25:53,398
We have also completed an establishment of a General Stabilization Fund and a Capital Stabilization Fund and Water Sewer Stabilization Fund, which has already been making a difference this year, having access to reserve funds for emergencies and capital needs.

209
00:25:55,738 --> 00:25:58,059
Ordinances-wise, we passed our budget ordinance.

210
00:25:58,299 --> 00:26:03,400
So excited about that and excited to see it used again this year.

211
00:26:04,178 --> 00:26:08,419
We did discuss the commercial vacancy tax, and that is still in committee.

212
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:10,819
Maybe it can come up again in the future.

213
00:26:10,839 --> 00:26:15,580
I will go over to Councilor Levingston, since that was his proposal, if he wants to talk about it more.

214
00:26:16,441 --> 00:26:17,181
Sure.

215
00:26:17,201 --> 00:26:21,742
So that whole project kind of split off into two things.

216
00:26:21,782 --> 00:26:32,684
So a couple of the things that I was working on initially ended up kind of being papers that I submitted to Inns Associates for the planning process.

217
00:26:33,803 --> 00:26:41,190
The commercial vacancy tax, um, I think it became clear during the 1 meeting that we had on it that it would require.

218
00:26:42,986 --> 00:27:05,032
probably meeting a few more meetings with building department and other parties to planning department to figure out the future of that, but I also submitted a request to the planning folks to include a building vacancy

219
00:27:06,042 --> 00:27:15,825
uh, tax, which is a building vacancy, I would say a fee, which is something that has been implemented in other cities without the need for a home rule petition.

220
00:27:15,885 --> 00:27:21,266
And it's not quite the level of a tax, but that's kind of like the other manifestation of that.

221
00:27:21,286 --> 00:27:24,047
Um, it would just come up later in the zoning process.

222
00:27:24,067 --> 00:27:30,209
So this has really evolved and maybe we should update this, uh, going forward.

223
00:27:30,929 --> 00:27:31,109
Yeah.

224
00:27:31,977 --> 00:27:32,999
I'll keep that as a note.

225
00:27:34,181 --> 00:27:39,611
Mr. Clerk, if you could keep as a note, we want to update this section around the commercial vacancy tax.

226
00:27:45,111 --> 00:27:45,511
Thank you.

227
00:27:45,591 --> 00:27:55,358
I just wanted to note that this is something that's come up in my discussion with residents lately a lot, especially about what happens to be the neighborhood that I live in.

228
00:27:55,378 --> 00:28:03,103
West Manfred Square has a lot of empty storefronts, and it's just been a common discussion.

229
00:28:03,263 --> 00:28:09,407
I'd love to help support any conversations you're having, Councilor Lemming, if it's helpful at all.

230
00:28:09,547 --> 00:28:12,309
So if you need a backup on this, I'd be happy to help.

231
00:28:15,816 --> 00:28:16,877
Seeing a nod, yes.

232
00:28:18,738 --> 00:28:20,919
Next item is the good landlord tax credit.

233
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:30,145
We actually have reviewed this and found that the way that the state law was structured makes this a really actually unappealing credit to implement.

234
00:28:30,245 --> 00:28:43,273
So it's probably not something we're going to move forward with, at least the discussions that we have with the assessor, or that this would be of great benefit to essentially only the very, very large commercial property, well,

235
00:28:44,255 --> 00:28:57,168
residential property owners, but the companies that own large multi-unit buildings and would not really be of benefit for our two-family, three-family landlords.

236
00:28:57,188 --> 00:28:58,449
That was really frustrating to hear.

237
00:29:01,472 --> 00:29:03,594
Councilor Callahan, did you want to talk on that?

238
00:29:08,072 --> 00:29:24,469
because I have not gotten the briefing that you have from the assessor, I am very curious and I just want to make sure that for myself I also agree that it is, you know, if I, like to me, if I think that it might be something that might help some folks.

239
00:29:24,489 --> 00:29:28,354
So I'm just curious, is the assessor the right person to talk to?

240
00:29:28,434 --> 00:29:28,654
Is there

241
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:41,278
Like, how can I understand a little bit more about it just to kind of get my own sense of what it is that that state law is in fact offering to us?

242
00:29:42,439 --> 00:29:47,503
Yeah, I think that we could reach out to the assessor's office and maybe try to get a written update for sure.

243
00:29:47,523 --> 00:29:56,229
Matt and I had a couple meetings, or Matt had some conversations, I had some conversations, and sure, we could pull together some information from those.

244
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:59,029
share that with the rest of the council.

245
00:29:59,069 --> 00:30:00,730
That would be lovely.

246
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:01,230
Thank you so much.

247
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:02,370
Great.

248
00:30:03,451 --> 00:30:05,251
I'm just going to zoom through the rest of it.

249
00:30:05,311 --> 00:30:06,392
Oh, go ahead, Councillor Collins.

250
00:30:08,953 --> 00:30:12,414
Sorry, you saw me raise and lower my hand because I wasn't sure if this was worth putting out there.

251
00:30:12,454 --> 00:30:22,358
But just for the benefit of residents who may be watching this update meeting, just to be clear, we're not going to change the disposition of any of these papers in this meeting.

252
00:30:22,378 --> 00:30:23,979
We're not going to take anything.

253
00:30:23,999 --> 00:30:25,519
We're not going to remove anything from committee.

254
00:30:25,539 --> 00:30:26,340
We're not going to fully

255
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:30,941
dispel with any papers, even though we might discuss what is likely to happen with them in the future.

256
00:30:31,421 --> 00:30:33,581
This is to just give a general overview.

257
00:30:33,601 --> 00:30:36,962
So for folks wondering, you know, when will the next step take place?

258
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:38,443
When will official action take place?

259
00:30:39,403 --> 00:30:40,063
Not in this meeting.

260
00:30:40,263 --> 00:30:47,705
Any papers even that we're going to take off the docket, they would have to be reviewed and placed on file from the committee that they're currently in.

261
00:30:48,165 --> 00:30:49,445
So just wanted to note that for clarity.

262
00:30:50,405 --> 00:30:51,405
Thank you, Vice President Collins.

263
00:30:51,445 --> 00:30:52,166
I appreciate that.

264
00:30:52,226 --> 00:30:53,966
No action is being taken at this meeting.

265
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:59,453
Um, this is just, uh, updating the document and kind of reviewing our progress on these different items.

266
00:31:00,274 --> 00:31:09,278
And, um, I think it would be good for all of our committees at some point this spring to maybe have a little bit of a. A clean up session at 1 of their meetings as well and, um.

267
00:31:09,978 --> 00:31:13,980
Either receiving place on file any papers that won't be moving forward or.

268
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,682
Otherwise, refer things to new committees if it seems like they should be going there.

269
00:31:20,157 --> 00:31:21,698
For the rest of this, I'll just go quickly.

270
00:31:21,959 --> 00:31:45,578
We also, in the future, would like to look at a Community Benefits Agreement ordinance around having a Community Benefits Committee that negotiates with very large real estate projects and nonprofits around what the needs assessment for our neighborhoods is and figuring out how that would work in alignment with our zoning process and also with the Community Development Board.

271
00:31:47,395 --> 00:32:03,289
We have a look at a percent for art ordinance that was proposed many years ago, which would create a requirement that 1% of costs would be earmarked for public art projects for large developments.

272
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:05,351
So that's something we could look at.

273
00:32:05,371 --> 00:32:09,354
We could also look at that probably in the context of our zoning project.

274
00:32:10,714 --> 00:32:16,137
President Morrell and I proposed looking at paid family medical leave for our city employees.

275
00:32:16,217 --> 00:32:24,602
I think that's something I really want to talk about in our budget cycle this year to see if that's a possibility, as well as extended illness leave bank.

276
00:32:25,283 --> 00:32:37,690
And then beyond that, the committee has advocated for pilot legislation requiring large nonprofits like Tufts University to pay a fair share in property taxes, as well as our general

277
00:32:38,368 --> 00:32:39,529
review of the city's finances.

278
00:32:39,569 --> 00:32:45,533
We do receive monthly warrant articles and regular financial updates and, um.

279
00:32:46,494 --> 00:32:49,917
Reviewing the city ordinances as named here as needed.

280
00:32:50,517 --> 00:32:52,839
I'll go to Councilors are and then Councilor Callahan.

281
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,161
Thank you.

282
00:32:55,341 --> 00:32:56,041
I'm sorry.

283
00:32:56,061 --> 00:33:02,526
I just wanted to, um I know you were you're trying to move forward, but paid family medical leave.

284
00:33:02,746 --> 00:33:04,728
I think I missed what you said about it.

285
00:33:04,788 --> 00:33:07,650
If anything, is there any possibility of that moving?

286
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:09,170
this year, do you think?

287
00:33:10,611 --> 00:33:18,655
So the enabling, the city council is the authority to vote to implement the program.

288
00:33:19,676 --> 00:33:24,178
City council by majority vote can enter into the state's paid family medical leave program.

289
00:33:24,898 --> 00:33:27,560
It would initially, it would require the city to budget for that.

290
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:34,303
So there'd be a budget impact, which a couple of years ago, Director Dickinson estimated within the $500,000 to $1 million per year range.

291
00:33:36,929 --> 00:33:38,730
may also have collective bargaining impacts.

292
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:45,473
So those are some of the questions we'd wanna discuss with the administration if we were gonna move forward with that.

293
00:33:46,673 --> 00:33:50,275
But we can vote to enter.

294
00:33:51,776 --> 00:33:52,236
Thank you.

295
00:33:53,717 --> 00:33:54,277
Councilor Callahan.

296
00:33:57,554 --> 00:33:59,355
Thanks.

297
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:01,915
So pardon me if I forgot I was up late last night.

298
00:34:03,096 --> 00:34:13,719
And I just wanted to ask, I think the mayor was going to provide us with a little bit more of a long-term capital spending plan now that we have the stabilization funds.

299
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:15,139
Did that happen?

300
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:16,620
Are we still waiting for that?

301
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:20,261
Is that something we expect in that administrative finance committee?

302
00:34:21,218 --> 00:34:27,461
Yeah, I think we'll see that in committee of the whole sometime in the first couple months of the year around the stabilization fund.

303
00:34:27,481 --> 00:34:33,223
And I think we may also expect an update to the capital improvement plan, which will be an even longer outlook as well.

304
00:34:34,724 --> 00:34:35,024
Thank you.

305
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:36,265
You got it.

306
00:34:36,745 --> 00:34:38,026
All right, I'm going to turn it over.

307
00:34:38,286 --> 00:34:40,647
Well, the next committee was education and culture committee.

308
00:34:40,667 --> 00:34:45,909
That's Councillor Scarpelli as the chair who's not present.

309
00:34:46,049 --> 00:34:48,330
I don't think this committee met this year.

310
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:49,831
It had a couple

311
00:34:50,732 --> 00:34:59,515
One item looking to identify public internship opportunities for students that counselor saying has been proposed and wanted to work on.

312
00:35:02,496 --> 00:35:08,358
And I will on this 1, I will recognize guest on for public participation.

313
00:35:08,378 --> 00:35:08,818
3 minutes.

314
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:15,251
Thank you, Mr. President.

315
00:35:15,291 --> 00:35:16,811
Gaston Fierro, 61 Sydney Road.

316
00:35:16,871 --> 00:35:20,193
I just had a question on page seven, right at the bottom.

317
00:35:20,953 --> 00:35:27,196
It says the first supplemental appropriation allocates $3 million to Medford Public Schools for fiscal year 25 funding.

318
00:35:27,316 --> 00:35:30,077
I would replace 1.75 million in ARPA funding.

319
00:35:30,517 --> 00:35:35,859
So I remember about those 1.75 million in ARPA funding that got voted sometime in June.

320
00:35:35,879 --> 00:35:41,662
So what happened to those 1.75 million ARPA funding given that it says here that they have been replaced by the 3 million

321
00:35:42,652 --> 00:35:45,033
Um, from the overrides.

322
00:35:45,773 --> 00:35:46,093
Thank you.

323
00:35:46,113 --> 00:35:56,896
So that, uh, there was a vote to revert that to, um, uh, essentially it was reverted back to the city for use for ARPA related purposes.

324
00:35:57,336 --> 00:36:03,398
Um, uh, the mayor, we would have to talk to the mayor about, uh, exactly specifically how it's going to be spent.

325
00:36:03,598 --> 00:36:08,319
All ARPA funds need to be encumbered by December 31st of this year per the federal law.

326
00:36:09,234 --> 00:36:25,112
The mayor did notify us that about 850,000 of that maybe a little bit more was utilized to purchase a new fire truck that was essentially the city of Lynn had purchased a fire truck.

327
00:36:25,712 --> 00:36:49,939
that was not able to fit in their fire stations but does fit in our fire stations and we were able to purchase that truck and that was a really big windfall because not necessarily from a money perspective but from a time perspective because right now it takes between 36 and 60 months to get a fire truck to the city and we're going to get a new vehicle engine.

328
00:36:50,898 --> 00:36:52,999
right away because it's already been delivered to Lynn.

329
00:36:53,079 --> 00:37:14,303
So I do know that is one item we received specifically that this funding was going towards, and the mayor said in a communication to us when we did the supplemental appropriation vote that those funds would go essentially towards capital priorities and other items in the capital plan so that they'd be expended before December 31st.

330
00:37:14,503 --> 00:37:17,644
But the mayor, I believe, is going to release a

331
00:37:18,539 --> 00:37:23,065
detailed final reporting on ARPA funding after the after December 31st.

332
00:37:24,389 --> 00:37:24,889
Okay, thank you.

333
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:37,992
So will there be a way to note in that detailed filing that we had 1.75 and then, you know, if less got used that we actually lost whatever remains up to 1.75?

334
00:37:38,892 --> 00:37:49,874
Because it looks to me that, you know, I mean, I'm not sure, but this replacement, I don't know whether it was a smart idea in the sense that even though we have to spend it by the end of this year,

335
00:37:51,431 --> 00:37:58,798
Jose Hernandez?s iPhone 2?s iPhone 2?s iPhone 2?s iPhone 2?s iPhone 2?s iPhone 2?s iPhone 2?s iPhone 2?s iPhone 2?s iPhone 2?s iPhone 2?s iPhone 2?s iPhone 2?s iPhone 2?s iPhone 2?s

336
00:38:14,318 --> 00:38:20,763
told us in public meetings and committed to, at least in conversation with me, they're gonna try to spend every last dollar that's available.

337
00:38:21,283 --> 00:38:24,966
And that's definitely the goal that I want to hold them to.

338
00:38:26,207 --> 00:38:27,007
Okay, thank you very much.

339
00:38:27,028 --> 00:38:28,429
I appreciate it.

340
00:38:28,449 --> 00:38:28,829
You got it.

341
00:38:29,169 --> 00:38:29,970
Vice President Collins.

342
00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:31,091
Thank you.

343
00:38:31,111 --> 00:38:33,212
Yeah, totally just echoing what was said.

344
00:38:33,452 --> 00:38:40,217
And just to reinforce the point, I know that the mayor's team has been doing a pretty good job of cataloging

345
00:38:42,285 --> 00:38:47,230
exactly what our ARPA expenditures have been and breaking those down by category.

346
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:51,634
I also do know and I don't think it's at all true that we're going to be leaving ARPA money on the table.

347
00:38:51,694 --> 00:38:54,797
I know that this was a fairly, you know, it's close to the end of the year.

348
00:38:55,467 --> 00:39:01,190
that the reallocation back to ARPA was made because of the revenue replacement from the Prop 2.5 override.

349
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:06,072
However, there were also some pretty late-breaking major expenditures that we did use ARPA funding for.

350
00:39:06,612 --> 00:39:12,615
So I just don't think it's, I don't, people shouldn't worry that we're leaving our ARPA monies on the table.

351
00:39:15,056 --> 00:39:15,837
Councilor Kellyanne.

352
00:39:16,857 --> 00:39:17,498
Thanks.

353
00:39:17,978 --> 00:39:22,300
I'm absolutely in favor of us checking in and making sure that that money is spent well.

354
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:23,721
I will say that

355
00:39:25,785 --> 00:39:30,869
Clearly, the mayor and the administration knew that there was a possibility that the overrides would pass.

356
00:39:31,209 --> 00:39:32,731
They knew about this 1.75 million.

357
00:39:32,751 --> 00:39:39,836
I'm sure that they had a plan for how to spend that money in case those got passed.

358
00:39:40,697 --> 00:39:43,019
But again, I appreciate it, and I think we should look into it.

359
00:39:43,659 --> 00:39:47,122
But I doubt very much that we lost that money.

360
00:39:48,824 --> 00:39:55,409
Yeah, and there was a communication or discussion, I believe, around the paper itself that

361
00:39:56,764 --> 00:40:20,916
there were projects in the pipeline that may have been asked for funds from the capital stabilization fund or another source that instead this ARPA money will be able to go towards, such as that fire engine, which it wasn't, you know, there are several fire apparatuses in the capital improvement plan along with, I think the mayor may have mentioned police cruisers and a couple of other items.

362
00:40:21,136 --> 00:40:24,138
There was a written document somewhere in a packet that we received.

363
00:40:29,005 --> 00:40:30,086
go to the governance committee.

364
00:40:30,126 --> 00:40:32,427
This is alphabetically convenient.

365
00:40:32,467 --> 00:40:38,191
Councilor Singh is also not present, so I can handle that quickly, and then we can go to our last four committees here.

366
00:40:39,612 --> 00:40:43,695
But this committee focuses on basically rules, charter, elections.

367
00:40:44,335 --> 00:40:50,019
The two projects that really have been worked on or are being planned to be worked on are updates to our city charter.

368
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:54,762
We did have some preliminary meetings beginning earlier this year.

369
00:40:56,542 --> 00:40:59,983
some prior to September and then starting in October and November.

370
00:41:00,523 --> 00:41:04,965
And we just received the draft proposal from the mayor.

371
00:41:05,565 --> 00:41:18,929
So we have that and we will be considering in the new year in January and February and maybe into March some amendments to that proposal.

372
00:41:19,589 --> 00:41:24,691
And then getting that to the mayor and getting the mayor to get that to the legislature so that the legislature can pass it.

373
00:41:25,245 --> 00:41:27,387
in time for it to be on the ballot in November of 2025.

374
00:41:27,767 --> 00:41:34,953
And if the voters were to approve it at that point, it would go into effect for the following election in 2027.

375
00:41:35,093 --> 00:41:38,236
So that's another huge, exciting project.

376
00:41:38,976 --> 00:41:42,939
I do want to thank the Starter Study Committee and the mayor and the Collins Center.

377
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:48,204
I know there will be some changes, maybe significant changes that we choose to make.

378
00:41:49,164 --> 00:41:49,765
You know, we are the

379
00:41:51,923 --> 00:42:01,510
the first elected officials taking a look at this after the mayor and, you know, we, it requires a super majority vote of this body to approve and we are the legislative body of the city.

380
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:05,093
So our voice is very important in this project.

381
00:42:05,653 --> 00:42:16,281
And I believe we will also, speaking with Councilor Hsuang, who's the chair of this committee, and I believe I'm his vice chair, we will be

382
00:42:17,492 --> 00:42:38,787
probably soliciting some feedback from our multi-member boards and commissions, as well as the school committee, maybe some other folks as well, just so that if they want to have a voice as part of this process, as the sitting school committee and boards and commissions, we'll be able to incorporate some of their recommendations and changes as well.

383
00:42:44,251 --> 00:42:47,173
All right, I'll turn it over to VP Collins, planning and permitting committee.

384
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:49,860
Thank you.

385
00:42:52,442 --> 00:43:00,986
Well, zoning wasn't literally the only thing that we did in this committee, but it was overwhelmingly the work of this committee so far this year and will remain the case next year.

386
00:43:02,407 --> 00:43:07,369
We had, I honestly, I gave up on counting the number of zoning meetings that we had.

387
00:43:07,389 --> 00:43:09,070
I think President Beers might have the number.

388
00:43:09,090 --> 00:43:10,091
16 so far.

389
00:43:10,111 --> 00:43:11,191
16, so only 16?

390
00:43:11,251 --> 00:43:11,371
Wow.

391
00:43:15,425 --> 00:43:16,806
I would have guessed even higher.

392
00:43:18,606 --> 00:43:30,831
We began meeting with Innis Associates very, very close to the top of the year, initially kind of mapping out our work plan for the comprehensive review of the city's zoning ordinances.

393
00:43:30,872 --> 00:43:38,555
And that was kind of a project in and of itself, because we knew that we wanted to talk about some citywide zoning approaches, some tweaks that would affect

394
00:43:39,355 --> 00:44:04,356
the whole community, and that we also wanted to go neighborhood by neighborhood or geography by geography, as the zoning consultants often refer to it in their language of planning consultants, so that we could consider both, you know, on really a street-by-street, neighborhood-by-neighborhood level, what do we know that the community wants for this neighborhood based on all of the research and community feedback that we have gathered?

395
00:44:05,416 --> 00:44:09,739
in the past, and especially through projects like the comprehensive planning process?

396
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:15,382
How do we make these more localized changes to manifest what we know people want?

397
00:44:15,862 --> 00:44:25,208
And then what are the changes that it makes sense to consider as a unit citywide, things around housing incentives,

398
00:44:28,396 --> 00:44:29,357
parking, et cetera.

399
00:44:30,157 --> 00:44:35,301
So breaking down how those pieces might work together so that we could get through all of our goals.

400
00:44:36,482 --> 00:44:46,309
We got our feet wet with some technical changes at the beginning of the year, updating our definitions, making some changes around site plan review that were really important on the city side.

401
00:44:46,990 --> 00:44:57,438
And one of my personal favorites, taking the vote so that the official zoning map of Medford is no longer paper and colored pencil, but an actual GIS digital file, which I think is

402
00:44:57,998 --> 00:44:59,341
pretty cool for 2024.

403
00:45:00,743 --> 00:45:04,971
Since then, in July, we really dove into kind of the meat of the project.

404
00:45:05,452 --> 00:45:07,476
We had a really cool mapping workshop

405
00:45:08,686 --> 00:45:15,848
in July, which I think set us up for our kind of geography by geography work that will carry us through June of 2025 or later.

406
00:45:15,868 --> 00:45:23,330
The zoning consultant prepared a lot of different kind of aerial views that showcase different characteristics around Medford.

407
00:45:23,370 --> 00:45:35,654
We looked at topography, we looked at flood zones, we looked at density, we looked at demography, we looked at traffic, so many different ways to think about what our places feel like and got a lot of interesting feedback there.

408
00:45:36,514 --> 00:45:39,895
We've been applying all of this to our geographies work.

409
00:45:39,935 --> 00:45:46,136
We started with the Mystic Ave Corridor District, which we just ordained last night.

410
00:45:46,216 --> 00:45:48,957
We had many, many meetings on that in committee.

411
00:45:48,977 --> 00:45:54,538
I went to City Council, I went to the Community Development Board, came back to the City Council last night, and it's been ordained.

412
00:45:55,178 --> 00:46:02,280
The Salem Street Corridor District was the next geography in the queue, and that one is about midway through.

413
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:04,220
Well, a little bit more than midway.

414
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:07,541
We've had a couple meetings about it in committee.

415
00:46:07,921 --> 00:46:10,522
It was just referred to the Community Development Board last night.

416
00:46:10,562 --> 00:46:13,042
They'll be holding public hearings on that as well.

417
00:46:13,882 --> 00:46:16,883
Abutters, I think, should be getting notices in mid-January.

418
00:46:16,903 --> 00:46:22,544
I know the planning staff is planning to send out those notices after Christmas so that doesn't get lost in Christmas mail.

419
00:46:23,404 --> 00:46:28,305
So there'll be more public hearings about the Salem Street Corrector District, and then I'll come back to the City Council.

420
00:46:29,145 --> 00:46:47,160
And towards the end of this year we've also been mapping out our plan for for what's next for what geographies, what neighborhoods will be turned to next, I don't have this memorized off the top of my head, but I'm pretty sure that at the beginning of the year, we will be looking at, I think we'll be turning to South Medford and hillsides.

421
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:57,345
And then later in the year, we'll be turning our focus towards North Medford, West Medford, Wellington, Medford Square, not in that order.

422
00:46:58,206 --> 00:47:15,915
But we are going to make sure that we keep a pace so that we can do a really thorough review and update of the zoning in all of Medford's neighborhoods, and then kind of widen the scope again and consider those broader topics that we really want to not consider piece by piece, but think about the whole community in one discussion.

423
00:47:18,663 --> 00:47:21,926
So that's zoning where that's, you know, that's a three minute version of zoning.

424
00:47:22,646 --> 00:47:24,068
President Behrs, would you mind scrolling down?

425
00:47:24,088 --> 00:47:27,651
I think there were a couple other ordinance projects that I wanted to, oh, right, sorry.

426
00:47:27,691 --> 00:47:30,553
Green score also subsumed within zoning.

427
00:47:30,733 --> 00:47:37,760
This was something that we reported out kind of in between Mystic Avenue Corridor District and Salem Street.

428
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:41,443
This is one of those citywide strategies.

429
00:47:42,243 --> 00:47:59,468
Um, Greenscore is, in a nutshell, it's a rubric that, um, is comprised of our existing building development standards, you know, when you develop in Medford, you know, what, what you have to do, specifications that you need, um, to build by, to be acceptable, to be approved.

430
00:47:59,928 --> 00:48:04,790
Um, and it also encompasses some newer and more ambitious environmental standards.

431
00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:09,591
And it also includes, um, not just environmental standards, but also community amenities.

432
00:48:10,952 --> 00:48:26,724
So that we can be encouraging developers to be adding in more of the things that we want to see into their projects, things like sidewalk improvements, things like parks, things like shade, hydration stations, and rewarding them when they do add those amenities into their projects.

433
00:48:27,364 --> 00:48:44,294
And then I'll also mention transportation demand management is an ordinance that's been brought up by councillors lemming and saying so that we can kind of this is a policy where we're in we can take a holistic look at transportation options in the city and also in the region.

434
00:48:46,048 --> 00:49:02,553
and set up a community-wide policy to be making sure that as new development comes in, development options are streamlined and that we can be encouraging developers to help us further streamline and build our transportation system as they're adding to our built environment.

435
00:49:05,974 --> 00:49:08,895
If you'll scroll down just a bit, President Behrs.

436
00:49:12,796 --> 00:49:13,256
Thank you.

437
00:49:14,177 --> 00:49:14,877
To round this out,

438
00:49:15,925 --> 00:49:18,907
some of the other things in this committee, the condo conversion ordinance.

439
00:49:19,347 --> 00:49:21,609
This is an ordinance that I proposed last year.

440
00:49:21,629 --> 00:49:25,051
It's kind of in stasis right now.

441
00:49:25,792 --> 00:49:29,374
It doesn't totally fit in within the zoning work, so it's kind of on the back burner.

442
00:49:29,834 --> 00:49:35,758
But I'm hopeful that we can advance this in 2025, because this is another strategy that would help us maintain

443
00:49:37,363 --> 00:49:37,403
Um.

444
00:49:37,423 --> 00:49:43,046
Maintain rental units as they are in Medford instead of seeing more of our housing stock being converted to unaffordable luxury housing.

445
00:49:44,186 --> 00:49:47,568
In this committee are also some of our housing home world petitions.

446
00:49:48,648 --> 00:49:51,489
Um in 2022 President bears and I proposed.

447
00:49:52,270 --> 00:49:55,071
Um that the council look at a tenant first rate of refusal.

448
00:49:55,571 --> 00:49:59,033
Normal petition as well as a rent stabilization and no fault eviction

449
00:50:04,375 --> 00:50:06,639
The rent stabilization and no fault eviction protections.

450
00:50:06,679 --> 00:50:08,442
We had one initial meeting on this.

451
00:50:08,723 --> 00:50:10,967
I think just one initial meeting on this over the summer.

452
00:50:11,928 --> 00:50:12,970
We haven't returned to it yet.

453
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:14,393
This has been a very busy committee.

454
00:50:14,473 --> 00:50:16,516
I am hopeful that we could pick up this project again.

455
00:50:17,965 --> 00:50:22,607
uh, early in 2025, especially when the new state legislative session resumes.

456
00:50:23,567 --> 00:50:29,169
Um, the real estate transfer fee Home Rule petition was also referred to the Planning and Permitting Committee.

457
00:50:29,689 --> 00:50:42,594
However, uh, before we met on it in committee, we did learn that the Affordable, uh, Homes Act at the state level did not include, um, the transfer fee, uh, as an op- as a, um, local option within it.

458
00:50:43,314 --> 00:50:46,555
So outlook is grim for this strategy at this time.

459
00:50:48,669 --> 00:50:53,810
Just finally, we will also review few schedules for a germane to the planning and permitting committee.

460
00:50:56,070 --> 00:51:05,472
We have the goal of reviewing a cycling safety ordinance to kind of adhere to and strengthen the city's existing complete streets policies and plans.

461
00:51:07,813 --> 00:51:15,154
We are hoping to, and then we have a number of other projects, including energy disclosure and other, I think there's,

462
00:51:18,235 --> 00:51:19,496
scroll down here on my own copy.

463
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:24,160
We have several other

464
00:51:26,616 --> 00:51:48,568
permitting and building related projects that I think could all cohere pretty well with the zoning work that we're doing, such as energy disclosure, benchmarking ordinance, which kind of go along with us trying to better work hand in hand with especially large developers to make sure that they're doing their part to help us know

465
00:51:50,029 --> 00:52:01,490
how we are doing at progressing towards our energy efficiency goals and our climate mitigation and adaptation goals and give us the data that we need to hold these large developers in these large buildings accountable.

466
00:52:03,123 --> 00:52:07,267
There was also the rental licensing ordinance referred into this committee.

467
00:52:07,327 --> 00:52:25,402
I think that this is a really valuable proposal that would help city staff do a lot of the work that we're talking about when it comes to making sure that we're having good communication with property owners in the city so that we can be working together on everything from energy efficiency to retrofits to making sure that tenants are getting the information that they need from the city.

468
00:52:25,482 --> 00:52:28,785
So we haven't had a chance to work on this in committee yet, but I'm hopeful that we will.

469
00:52:33,166 --> 00:52:38,788
And then finally, these are two ordinances proposed by Councilor Seng, pesticide regulations.

470
00:52:38,828 --> 00:53:00,574
I know this is important to many folks in the community, as well as blasting and earth removal regulations, which I think the goal of that would be to prohibit future Winthrop Street style disturbances where developers are able to do really loud, disruptive earth removal and blasting without a lot of controls on the city side.

471
00:53:03,448 --> 00:53:05,690
Um, and then just around this out quickly.

472
00:53:05,710 --> 00:53:11,736
Oversight and engagement wise if we ever get free time in this committee, which I doubt which will, which I doubt will happen.

473
00:53:11,776 --> 00:53:15,159
We will review other relevant city organises and regulations.

474
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:26,230
Um, Councilors Garpelli as the chair of the License, Providing and Sign Application Subcommittee continues to, um, meet on these topics when needed.

475
00:53:29,281 --> 00:53:41,889
And then I think we're also hoping to fold in energy retrofits for existing buildings into our overall work around large building and potentially small building accountability and collaboration on our climate goals.

476
00:53:46,091 --> 00:53:47,412
Quite enough for one committee, I would say.

477
00:53:47,672 --> 00:53:48,133
I'll leave it there.

478
00:53:48,153 --> 00:53:56,518
I'll go to Councillor Callahan.

479
00:53:58,373 --> 00:53:58,613
Thanks.

480
00:53:58,993 --> 00:54:03,656
This is a good reminder for some of the things that I said I would work on that I should maybe move forward.

481
00:54:03,716 --> 00:54:05,237
So thank you very much for that.

482
00:54:06,718 --> 00:54:21,407
I also wanted to ask, I'm going to guess because it wasn't on this list at the beginning of the year, but we did discuss getting, and we also got a little bit more information from the assessors on the possibility of a residential exemption.

483
00:54:21,527 --> 00:54:22,868
And I'm just curious what,

484
00:54:24,309 --> 00:54:30,953
what committee that would be discussed in, if we decide to, you know, to have a discussion around the information that's provided?

485
00:54:30,973 --> 00:54:41,640
I think it'd probably fall under the administration and finance committee, but also probably would end up mostly ending up being implemented in committee of the whole, would be my guess.

486
00:54:42,881 --> 00:54:44,461
My best thinking at the time, and maybe

487
00:54:45,802 --> 00:54:53,392
Mr. Clerk, if you could put in the report a note that we want to add the residential exemption in to this document, I think that's a really great flag, Anna.

488
00:54:53,592 --> 00:54:54,313
Thanks, Mr. Clerk.

489
00:54:55,074 --> 00:54:56,196
And I'll go to Councilor Zaro.

490
00:54:58,183 --> 00:54:58,583
Thank you.

491
00:54:58,723 --> 00:55:01,506
I just also want it similarly to Councilor Callahan.

492
00:55:01,546 --> 00:55:07,712
It's reminding me of some of the things I've been discussing with some residents and other lawmakers.

493
00:55:08,653 --> 00:55:21,945
I've been meeting with, we passed recently the asking DCR and MassDOT to lower the speed limit in the city.

494
00:55:22,329 --> 00:55:33,297
And that was never in a committee so I wonder where in the governing agenda, we would put something like that like accomplishments from other that never needed to go to committee ended up being something that we just passed in regular session.

495
00:55:34,638 --> 00:55:42,124
But it does kind of fall under the one of the things that counselor Collins mentioned about like bike safety made me think about it.

496
00:55:42,817 --> 00:55:49,140
And I just had a meeting today that would be sort of like an ongoing discussion of like how to implement, what are the other areas?

497
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:55,082
Somebody had an accident recently, we were sort of talking about like how best to address some of those issues.

498
00:55:55,102 --> 00:56:07,688
So I'm curious about like, you know, where do we put things that aren't actually like, they're not a paper number, but they're ongoing issues that are like discussions with DCR about how to implement traffic mitigation measures.

499
00:56:09,809 --> 00:56:11,250
Yeah, that's a great flag.

500
00:56:12,918 --> 00:56:14,459
Councilor Collins, you have a thought on that or?

501
00:56:16,180 --> 00:56:31,630
I would just say, well, I would say in general, I think if this meeting is a great time to mention things and I can, as the co-editor of this document, I'm happy to make flags and we can make sure that things are, that this document is fully updated with the full scope of what we're working on.

502
00:56:31,650 --> 00:56:32,731
I'm sure that I missed some stuff.

503
00:56:33,571 --> 00:56:35,413
I did make sure to note in

504
00:56:39,019 --> 00:56:43,341
under public works and facilities committee, there is a project about street and sidewalk repair and accessibility.

505
00:56:43,401 --> 00:56:47,944
So I did make sure to at least note that advocacy that's been going on from the city council.

506
00:56:49,085 --> 00:56:50,966
Councilor Lazaro, and thank you for your leadership on that.

507
00:56:52,426 --> 00:56:58,910
Yeah, and I think we could, you know, definitely for those resolutions where it just goes to a regular meeting and gets done.

508
00:56:59,090 --> 00:57:06,054
If folks want to see that included in here, either as an accomplishment, something that's been completed or something that's initiated a

509
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:23,960
project that didn't go to committee, we could just, you know, get one-on-one email the two of us and we can figure out either if it should go into a committee and if that means we should refer it to committee or we can put it under committee of the whole or we could even create another section for regular meeting items.

510
00:57:25,061 --> 00:57:25,602
Council is all.

511
00:57:26,653 --> 00:57:29,554
I guess the question would only come up for me.

512
00:57:29,574 --> 00:57:35,116
It's not as important a thing if it's something that's so simple that it's done right away.

513
00:57:35,136 --> 00:57:49,041
But in this case, I think it's traffic mitigation that's going to be a continual project, especially with conversations that we have to have in an ongoing manner with DCR.

514
00:57:49,662 --> 00:57:52,103
And something that came up today was

515
00:57:56,883 --> 00:57:58,964
Well, I guess this would be a paper I would introduce in the future.

516
00:57:58,984 --> 00:58:11,768
So maybe this is something that's a new discussion, but how to support state-level goals to do with traffic cameras that might be introduced.

517
00:58:11,868 --> 00:58:16,250
But that's something that would be state-level, and we would be maybe just a support player.

518
00:58:16,310 --> 00:58:25,053
But since it's something that was passed at our level but does require follow-up, I guess that's the, that's like, where would that live?

519
00:58:27,045 --> 00:58:28,145
Got it, great, thank you.

520
00:58:28,385 --> 00:58:29,006
Councilor Kellyanne.

521
00:58:29,846 --> 00:58:40,330
I welcome anyone who has traffic related or roads related or sidewalk related, anything to ask that it go into the public works and facilities committee.

522
00:58:41,170 --> 00:58:42,550
I would be happy to take those in my committee.

523
00:58:42,590 --> 00:58:45,211
So if that seems like the appropriate place, then I welcome it.

524
00:58:46,192 --> 00:58:48,172
Yeah, it sounds like in a lot of cases, yes.

525
00:58:49,913 --> 00:58:52,514
I just wanted to note on these planning and permitting items,

526
00:58:53,899 --> 00:58:56,620
Councilor Callahan, I'd love to work with you.

527
00:58:56,640 --> 00:59:04,744
I've had some meetings with Quentin Zondervan and some other folks around benchmarking and disclosure and some other items.

528
00:59:04,804 --> 00:59:06,845
And I'd love to loop in with you.

529
00:59:06,885 --> 00:59:12,468
I know we're gonna have a conversation in the next couple of weeks.

530
00:59:12,648 --> 00:59:17,050
So that's something we could talk about, but I think some exciting things there.

531
00:59:17,110 --> 00:59:18,451
So just wanted to note that.

532
00:59:19,752 --> 00:59:22,133
And I actually, awesome.

533
00:59:23,277 --> 00:59:25,441
I apologize to my colleagues.

534
00:59:25,621 --> 00:59:27,064
I need to step out of this meeting.

535
00:59:27,484 --> 00:59:28,586
I really apologize.

536
00:59:29,848 --> 00:59:33,054
Councillor Collins, if you could take over from here, if that's all right.

537
00:59:34,356 --> 00:59:35,218
I just wanted to thank

538
00:59:36,625 --> 00:59:39,327
of my colleagues for a great year.

539
00:59:39,828 --> 00:59:44,211
I will watch the rest of this meeting for the last committees for the work they're doing.

540
00:59:44,271 --> 00:59:47,053
I know so much is getting done in all of them.

541
00:59:47,373 --> 00:59:50,055
And there's a lot more that folks are excited to do in the new year.

542
00:59:50,195 --> 00:59:53,397
So thank you, Councilors Lozano, Callahan and Leming.

543
00:59:53,438 --> 00:59:56,620
I apologize that I won't be here to hear the rest of that.

544
00:59:57,133 --> 01:00:05,766
just putting a link in the chat for you, Vice President Collins, and you can take a stone, but you're in charge.

545
01:00:05,806 --> 01:00:06,167
Thank you.

546
01:00:06,487 --> 01:00:06,688
Great.

547
01:00:07,209 --> 01:00:08,971
Thank you.

548
01:00:09,172 --> 01:00:11,856
Give me a second to get situated, colleagues.

549
01:00:15,125 --> 01:00:16,606
Great, we have three more committees to go.

550
01:00:16,626 --> 01:00:22,468
I would respectfully request that, and I'll first do a disclaimer about my own hypocrisy.

551
01:00:22,508 --> 01:00:24,349
I know I went long in my committee and my defense.

552
01:00:24,509 --> 01:00:27,551
We meet twice a month instead of once a month or less.

553
01:00:29,051 --> 01:00:35,855
But if we could try to speed run the updates on the remaining three committees, because I also have a appointment I have to get to soon.

554
01:00:41,254 --> 01:00:44,177
Let me just find where we were, and then I'll share my screen.

555
01:00:48,082 --> 01:00:55,751
The first can take public participation on the, I guess, most recent on the public and

556
01:00:57,674 --> 01:00:58,835
Well, doesn't matter.

557
01:00:58,995 --> 01:01:00,316
I forget what committee we just went over.

558
01:01:00,576 --> 01:01:02,498
Gaston, just for the record.

559
01:01:02,518 --> 01:01:03,979
Thank you very much.

560
01:01:04,039 --> 01:01:04,679
I'll be quick.

561
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:11,785
So I just wanted to mention whether we could add to the helpful documents link the cycling safety ordinance, which is missing.

562
01:01:12,679 --> 01:01:34,894
And then quickly too, so related to your committee, Madam Chair, so I wanted to, so one of the early meetings regarding the Mystic Avenue corridor, I mentioned bicycle lanes, and then the planner mentioned that that's not part of the planning, that the road sort of, you know, they don't consider it.

563
01:01:35,235 --> 01:01:38,577
So I was wondering whether, you know, given the parking sort of ease,

564
01:01:39,008 --> 01:01:50,064
whether we could have a more holistic approach and then also consider cycling as part of the ongoing ordinance revision or review.

565
01:01:50,785 --> 01:01:54,049
Because I think that, you know, sometimes it achieves better results.

566
01:01:54,870 --> 01:02:07,986
in the sense of like bringing everyone together, you know, sort of like drivers and cyclists versus, you know, we just talk about parking and then later on, then the bicycle commission comes in and says like, oh, we want to push for a lane here, something like that.

567
01:02:08,006 --> 01:02:09,808
So that's just a thought whether we could think about that.

568
01:02:09,848 --> 01:02:10,329
Thank you so much.

569
01:02:10,785 --> 01:02:11,265
Yeah, great.

570
01:02:11,305 --> 01:02:11,866
Thank you so much.

571
01:02:11,906 --> 01:02:12,946
I really appreciate that.

572
01:02:13,266 --> 01:02:23,652
And I agree when it comes to something is important, but thorny to implement as bike lanes really important to get all stakeholders in the room early in the game.

573
01:02:23,692 --> 01:02:30,595
And I will make a note to add the cycling safety, sorry, the cycling master plan to the helpful links, a section of the document.

574
01:02:31,736 --> 01:02:32,356
Appreciate that.

575
01:02:33,116 --> 01:02:39,860
All right, let me share my screen and we'll go to Councillor Lazaro for presentation on

576
01:02:42,619 --> 01:02:43,419
projects in the community.

577
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:45,560
Thank you.

578
01:02:45,700 --> 01:02:50,021
So we are at Public Health and Community Safety.

579
01:02:50,041 --> 01:02:54,462
We met a fair amount this year.

580
01:02:54,482 --> 01:03:01,904
I will start at the major projects that we only met one time to talk about the warm air and cooling center, just an overview that

581
01:03:04,074 --> 01:03:18,977
is a project that has kind of been backburnered, not because of lack of interest, but because of cost and more emergent issues.

582
01:03:19,957 --> 01:03:23,638
There's also alternative emergency responsibility and oversight.

583
01:03:23,698 --> 01:03:28,579
That's something that we can definitely discuss going forward, as well as One Stop Center for Public Services.

584
01:03:29,059 --> 01:03:29,879
These are things that were

585
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:39,943
offered before I came in to lead this committee, but I'm happy to address them as they're presented, yet the One-Stop Center hasn't.

586
01:03:40,874 --> 01:03:54,242
hasn't been assigned a paper number, but the things that we did talk about this year was 24021 was plant medicine decriminalization resolution that was in support of something that was at the state level, which we did pass.

587
01:03:56,863 --> 01:04:05,368
There's the overgrowth ordinance, which we are in process of working on, and updates to the rodent control ordinance, which is new.

588
01:04:05,428 --> 01:04:07,349
That's something we have also been working on.

589
01:04:08,107 --> 01:04:30,362
Um, we were meeting closely with the director of the board of health, um, talking about how this is all of these ordinances kind of work together to, um, mitigate, uh, complications with, um, things that happen in the city that end up contributing to rodent issues that if we address them all in conjunction, it can, um, mitigate those problems.

590
01:04:30,663 --> 01:04:33,945
So, uh, these things come from the board of health.

591
01:04:34,326 --> 01:04:37,948
and then they come to us and we can implement those suggestions.

592
01:04:39,810 --> 01:04:51,097
We did the wildlife feeding ordinance that was a lot of meetings, and it resulted in an ordinance that is now on the books, which is great and exciting.

593
01:04:52,257 --> 01:04:54,359
And there's some other stuff that we haven't taken up yet.

594
01:04:55,219 --> 01:05:00,522
Regulating retail sales of animals, that hasn't been taken up yet, but I'd be happy to do that when it comes up.

595
01:05:01,860 --> 01:05:06,202
We have recently had a meeting about gender affirming care and reproductive health care protection.

596
01:05:06,222 --> 01:05:16,666
I would like to take this up again soon because it's one of these kind of emergent things similar to CCOPS, which we, I mean, I'll get to that in a minute.

597
01:05:17,186 --> 01:05:18,267
Actually, it's not even on here.

598
01:05:19,368 --> 01:05:23,111
I think probably because we should probably add it in.

599
01:05:23,592 --> 01:05:27,154
But the civilian, what does it stand for?

600
01:05:27,174 --> 01:05:30,157
Community control over public surveillance.

601
01:05:30,477 --> 01:05:30,717
Thank you.

602
01:05:30,737 --> 01:05:39,904
Community control over public surveillance ordinance was established and already part of our ordinances.

603
01:05:41,505 --> 01:05:47,470
But we were closing a couple of loopholes and making it even stronger.

604
01:05:48,884 --> 01:05:52,887
in response to requests from our community members.

605
01:05:53,687 --> 01:05:57,069
And that was something that just came up very recently.

606
01:05:57,769 --> 01:06:00,851
And we completed it just last night.

607
01:06:01,091 --> 01:06:05,674
But, you know, that was something that was already complete.

608
01:06:05,814 --> 01:06:09,916
But I think it wouldn't have even occurred to us that we would come back into it.

609
01:06:10,016 --> 01:06:11,277
But, you know, these things kind of

610
01:06:12,048 --> 01:06:19,112
come from the community, we respond to their requests, and we make it happen as people speak to us.

611
01:06:19,192 --> 01:06:21,533
And it becomes clear that it's something the community wants.

612
01:06:21,654 --> 01:06:22,294
We make it happen.

613
01:06:23,274 --> 01:06:26,396
So that's something that just came about.

614
01:06:26,616 --> 01:06:31,359
And I think the Gender Affirming Care and Reproductive Health Care Protection Ordinance will be another thing like that.

615
01:06:31,499 --> 01:06:33,961
And that's something I'm eager to take up early in 2025.

616
01:06:38,448 --> 01:06:40,329
Um, another thing is an ongoing thing.

617
01:06:40,349 --> 01:06:41,489
Surveillance ordinance reporting.

618
01:06:41,549 --> 01:06:43,049
That's that's the C cups ordinance.

619
01:06:43,069 --> 01:06:45,510
That's a regular reporting requirement of the ordinance.

620
01:06:45,570 --> 01:06:50,932
We had 11 instance of Chief Buckley coming in doing a report.

621
01:06:50,952 --> 01:06:53,913
I believe that happens again next year.

622
01:06:53,933 --> 01:07:03,276
Um, housing stability, notification ordinance implementation and enforcement is, um and emergency response equipment replacement.

623
01:07:03,296 --> 01:07:05,296
That's a future thing.

624
01:07:05,756 --> 01:07:07,677
But this is something that we review annually.

625
01:07:08,863 --> 01:07:12,605
So yeah, I think I'm in lieu of taking too much more time.

626
01:07:12,645 --> 01:07:18,208
I know we had a very long meeting yesterday, but I think I will just stop there.

627
01:07:18,408 --> 01:07:23,091
But I'm very eager to continue with the work of this committee.

628
01:07:23,151 --> 01:07:28,134
It's been fruitful and useful, and I'm excited to keep going.

629
01:07:29,622 --> 01:07:30,523
Thank you, Chair Lozaro.

630
01:07:30,583 --> 01:07:38,828
And just to, if I might, just to add here, I know that your committee has been the home for a lot of my ordinances this year.

631
01:07:38,848 --> 01:07:40,689
So thank you for support on those.

632
01:07:40,769 --> 01:07:46,913
And I also want to, you know, a lot of those related to the Overgrowth Ordinance, the Rural Control Ordinance, the Wildlife Feeding Ordinance.

633
01:07:47,434 --> 01:07:49,855
So this is the committee in which we are doing

634
01:07:50,996 --> 01:07:56,157
work to try to respond to community concerns about our escalating population.

635
01:07:56,217 --> 01:07:59,238
We've been working closely with the health director.

636
01:07:59,718 --> 01:08:14,802
So thank you for always making space and time for this committee for us to advance those projects so we can do a better job for the human constituents of Medford and a harsher job for the world of constituents.

637
01:08:15,662 --> 01:08:18,223
A worse job for the rest of us.

638
01:08:18,623 --> 01:08:19,723
I forgot how to phrase that.

639
01:08:21,802 --> 01:08:23,403
vote again voted out by rats.

640
01:08:25,205 --> 01:08:25,845
The fat cats.

641
01:08:26,045 --> 01:08:26,786
I mean, the fat rats.

642
01:08:28,507 --> 01:08:30,649
All right, on to the Public Works and Facilities Committee.

643
01:08:31,089 --> 01:08:32,070
Councilor Callahan, take it away.

644
01:08:32,688 --> 01:08:32,948
Thank you.

645
01:08:33,989 --> 01:08:43,097
So I know that one thing that is a top topic for people in our city to talk about and to complain about is roads and sidewalks.

646
01:08:44,618 --> 01:08:54,326
For perfectly good reason, we got into a hole because the roads and sidewalks were not properly updated for many, many, many, many, many years.

647
01:08:54,767 --> 01:08:58,009
So we are doing our best as a city to dig ourselves out of there.

648
01:08:58,670 --> 01:09:00,572
I think my plan, so we had one, we had the,

649
01:09:01,462 --> 01:09:05,585
DBW commissioner, as well as the lead engineer, come to a meeting in the spring.

650
01:09:05,985 --> 01:09:11,129
They will be coming to another meeting, which I thought was going to be in December, but it turns out it's going to be in January.

651
01:09:11,850 --> 01:09:30,604
And I think my goal is to have them come in twice a year, just to give updates to the public, have a public meeting with them there, being able to report, see how we're doing in terms of getting our roads back from the brink and really getting us on that uptake where every year our average road

652
01:09:31,184 --> 01:09:36,646
rating is getting better instead of getting worse, which has been happening for a long time in the past.

653
01:09:37,706 --> 01:09:40,847
So that's kind of my plan on that one, is to have them come in a couple of times a year.

654
01:09:40,867 --> 01:09:49,650
I know Councilor Behrs has also asked for some information from our building commissioner and some others on city facilities.

655
01:09:50,010 --> 01:09:55,632
So I will check in with President Behrs about that, and perhaps we can have one where we have an update

656
01:09:57,052 --> 01:09:58,112
on that as well.

657
01:09:59,453 --> 01:10:03,594
We have the public restrooms and parks and squares that has come into our committee.

658
01:10:03,614 --> 01:10:06,235
We're working on that.

659
01:10:06,715 --> 01:10:14,498
Lead ordinance, clearly with the notifications that came out from the city about lead pipes, I think it is more on people's minds than it was.

660
01:10:14,898 --> 01:10:17,639
It is something that has always been important to me.

661
01:10:18,739 --> 01:10:26,362
And so I hope that in the new year, we do start working on this lead ordinance, which we have not yet given a paper number.

662
01:10:27,523 --> 01:10:31,244
There is also a home rule petition to increase excise taxes for large trucks.

663
01:10:33,145 --> 01:10:35,886
Vice President Collins, do you want to give us a tiny update on that?

664
01:10:36,987 --> 01:10:37,207
Sure.

665
01:10:37,227 --> 01:10:39,187
The update is that there is no update.

666
01:10:39,248 --> 01:10:44,250
This is something that I would like to do, but I think this is something that I would not take committee capacity for.

667
01:10:46,983 --> 01:10:49,184
over other projects necessarily next year.

668
01:10:49,265 --> 01:10:58,011
So if we do have one of those sessions to review papers and committee and see what might not occur in 2025, what maybe should be disposed of.

669
01:10:58,031 --> 01:11:04,416
Unless there is a groundswell of support from the community, this might be something that is not a priority item for next year.

670
01:11:05,551 --> 01:11:10,697
it will likely go on the back burner when we discuss these projects at a committee meeting in the future.

671
01:11:11,718 --> 01:11:28,195
Public utility accountability, I will say when I have spoken to staff, they are actually doing a really excellent job compared to prior years and prior administrations on holding our public utilities accountable and forcing them to do road repair and sidewalk repair

672
01:11:29,056 --> 01:11:31,961
as much as we are legally allowed to force them to do that.

673
01:11:32,962 --> 01:11:42,097
So, we can maybe also get an update on that from the DPW commissioner when they when they come into our committee to talk about roads.

674
01:11:44,041 --> 01:11:49,225
The Tree Planting Volunteer Network is something that I talked about a lot on the campaign trail.

675
01:11:49,505 --> 01:11:51,387
It's probably my absolute favorite policy.

676
01:11:51,407 --> 01:11:52,387
I'm very excited about it.

677
01:11:52,467 --> 01:12:07,318
And at our next public works meeting in January, the public works commissioner will be, sorry, DPW commissioner will be having our first discussion about how to implement this.

678
01:12:07,738 --> 01:12:12,242
This is basically allowing residents, because most of the cost of planting trees in the city

679
01:12:12,943 --> 01:12:17,831
replacing, we lose far more trees than we replace, so we're losing trees every single year.

680
01:12:20,482 --> 01:12:26,503
And for sure, the major cost of that is labor and not the price of the tree.

681
01:12:26,923 --> 01:12:43,187
So the goal is to allow residents to volunteer, to work together with training, with appropriate trees, with the appropriate depth, doing it all the right way, but to allow residents to plant city trees.

682
01:12:44,148 --> 01:12:51,954
So it does sound like that is something that the administration is amenable to, and I'm really looking forward to our first conversation about that in January.

683
01:12:53,676 --> 01:12:57,279
And aside from that, we are just, you know, reviewing other things.

684
01:12:58,420 --> 01:13:02,623
So I'm looking forward to 2025 and us getting some of those things done.

685
01:13:02,804 --> 01:13:03,064
Thank you.

686
01:13:05,086 --> 01:13:06,247
Thank you so much, Councilor Callahan.

687
01:13:10,050 --> 01:13:11,231
I'm also excited for the

688
01:13:12,731 --> 01:13:14,152
tree planting volunteer network.

689
01:13:15,553 --> 01:13:19,837
All right, on to our final committee to review resident services and public engagement.

690
01:13:19,877 --> 01:13:20,718
Another prolific one.

691
01:13:21,558 --> 01:13:23,760
Councilor Lemming, your quick update, please.

692
01:13:24,321 --> 01:13:24,741
Thank you.

693
01:13:24,761 --> 01:13:28,164
We have a residence guide in English.

694
01:13:28,264 --> 01:13:30,786
Thank you, Councilor Sang, for making that.

695
01:13:30,806 --> 01:13:32,327
It needs to be made multilingual.

696
01:13:33,849 --> 01:13:35,550
We'll do that later.

697
01:13:35,790 --> 01:13:39,914
Modernizing city council communications has really been the major project of this.

698
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:44,663
Um, we have basically every meeting we draft a newsletter, send it out.

699
01:13:44,723 --> 01:13:46,905
We also have YouTube streaming, which is pretty cool.

700
01:13:47,565 --> 01:13:52,429
I'd like to thank all my colleagues for creating the listening sessions.

701
01:13:52,890 --> 01:13:57,613
So far we've had three with the Arab community, the Portuguese speaking community and seniors.

702
01:13:58,374 --> 01:14:06,360
Um, it was found in practice that these were kind of difficult to like, it was difficult to like organize all of these in, um,

703
01:14:08,541 --> 01:14:08,601
Um.

704
01:14:08,621 --> 01:14:10,721
Practice and kind of like a one off fashion.

705
01:14:10,761 --> 01:14:12,022
So we're going to continue to do that.

706
01:14:12,102 --> 01:14:19,003
But Councilor Lazaro and I have also decided to start scheduling regular listening sessions at the senior center.

707
01:14:19,023 --> 01:14:20,464
Uh, next year.

708
01:14:20,484 --> 01:14:22,704
Um, we.

709
01:14:23,864 --> 01:14:31,706
Past a and also, um, like to thank counselor Cal and for work on the upcoming listening session at the West

710
01:14:35,845 --> 01:14:40,767
Harmon Zuckerman, PB – He, Him, His): Have a welcoming ordinance like to thank counselor saying for introducing that last year.

711
01:14:41,187 --> 01:14:42,887
Sorry for all the jumping around that you're doing.

712
01:14:42,907 --> 01:14:45,488
I just kind of made a text list so that I can do this quickly.

713
01:14:45,508 --> 01:14:46,248
Yeah.

714
01:14:46,268 --> 01:14:48,009
Harmon Zuckerman, PB – He, Him, His.:

715
01:14:48,009 --> 01:14:49,349
: A welcoming ordinance.

716
01:14:49,369 --> 01:14:50,350
Harmon Zuckerman, PB – He, Him, His.:

717
01:14:50,350 --> 01:14:53,651
: Which was passed for first reading last night.

718
01:14:55,085 --> 01:14:59,370
And hopefully will be passed for a third reading on January 14.

719
01:15:02,033 --> 01:15:11,645
I don't know if this was in there, but if this is in the governing agenda, because it was kind of put on there as an ad hoc thing.

720
01:15:12,751 --> 01:15:15,893
as a result of the veteran services director efforts.

721
01:15:15,933 --> 01:15:27,641
But we're working right now on a veteran veteran rental assistant program, which is set to be discussed in council on the 14th and hopefully passed for a first reading them.

722
01:15:27,661 --> 01:15:29,182
But I still have to submit that paper.

723
01:15:29,202 --> 01:15:37,368
Um, Councilor Callahan and I, this is another one that's not on the agenda, but these things kind of crop up are also working with some, um,

724
01:15:38,710 --> 01:15:46,477
uh, mothers of kids with disabilities, uh, to, uh, create after school programs for them.

725
01:15:46,497 --> 01:15:53,363
Uh, there, a lot of the stuff mentioned here is some of the commission, uh, work that Councillor Seng is working on.

726
01:15:53,403 --> 01:15:59,248
I know that there are, uh, he's doing a lot of behind the scenes work on a human rights commission ordinance.

727
01:15:59,608 --> 01:16:03,411
Um, I don't, I'm not always a hundred percent aware, um,

728
01:16:04,759 --> 01:16:06,840
what is going on behind the scenes.

729
01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:17,583
Some of these were introduced before I was on council, but whenever he does have progress, I make sure to make time in the committee so that we can move on those.

730
01:16:19,004 --> 01:16:31,868
I know that the, I believe that the data policies that are mentioned there haven't been worked on, worked on a whole lot, but that could be something that we start on the next year.

731
01:16:33,542 --> 01:16:34,782
And that is all that I have.

732
01:16:36,643 --> 01:16:36,863
Great.

733
01:16:36,883 --> 01:16:38,863
Thank you so much, Councilor Lemming.

734
01:16:39,123 --> 01:16:51,086
And like I mentioned, this has been another really remarkably prolific committee, and I do want to commend you as chair for your leadership in all of the work to modernize City Council communications.

735
01:16:51,126 --> 01:16:54,427
I mean, just saying it like that, it doesn't sound like as much of an effort as it has been.

736
01:16:55,087 --> 01:17:06,819
But, you know, piloting a city council newsletter, getting the meetings accessible on YouTube, which for some people is easier than Medford Community Media, and they're available instead of a couple days later.

737
01:17:06,839 --> 01:17:11,484
Obviously, not a pejorative on MCM.

738
01:17:12,184 --> 01:17:13,165
We love that service as well.

739
01:17:13,185 --> 01:17:13,766
It's very vital.

740
01:17:15,107 --> 01:17:17,109
But the proliferation of ways that people can

741
01:17:19,222 --> 01:17:33,648
about what's happening on the City Council and read about it and go more into depth if they want or just get the bite-sized version is a really stark contrast to previous years when there were very, very, very few ways to know what the City Council was doing and ways to digest that information.

742
01:17:33,768 --> 01:17:43,451
So I think this committee is to be commended for their many meetings to work on those projects as well as the City Council Residence Guide.

743
01:17:43,491 --> 01:17:48,213
I know that these are things that have been really appreciated by a lot of people who have joined us in the chambers

744
01:17:51,141 --> 01:17:57,284
I think that takes us to the end of this document.

745
01:17:57,505 --> 01:18:01,747
And I did note the two things that you mentioned in this committee that were not included on the governing agenda.

746
01:18:01,787 --> 01:18:15,995
I will make sure to update those along with our other additions and updates to the documents so that we can get a clean as of end of December 2024 version to circulate and to have online on the city council portal.

747
01:18:17,439 --> 01:18:22,862
I believe we're also going to take a look in terms of other updates to this document before we promulgate the next clean version.

748
01:18:22,882 --> 01:18:32,526
I think we're also going to update those Spreadsheet calendars for each committee and make sure that those are still up to date and reflective of the current information.

749
01:18:32,546 --> 01:18:38,649
A final edit that I will do is going back and updating the table of contents, which I'm not sure has been

750
01:18:39,369 --> 01:18:44,071
accurate now that we have added a lot of projects and changed the status of a lot of projects.

751
01:18:45,072 --> 01:18:49,774
So we can, you can expect those edits in coming weeks.

752
01:18:53,656 --> 01:18:59,719
I just want to thank my colleagues for their work on this document and their help

753
01:19:00,629 --> 01:19:07,831
to me and updating it and for all of the work that's gone into the projects that it gives an overview on.

754
01:19:07,891 --> 01:19:16,594
I'm really grateful for your hard work and your diligence and your willingness to be in the city call chambers twice a week, almost all weeks.

755
01:19:18,495 --> 01:19:19,295
Appreciate your partnership.

756
01:19:20,416 --> 01:19:22,376
Any other comments to add?

757
01:19:24,117 --> 01:19:24,877
Motion to adjourn.

758
01:19:26,178 --> 01:19:26,338
Sorry.

759
01:19:26,358 --> 01:19:26,618
Withdrawn.

760
01:19:31,263 --> 01:19:32,104
Go ahead, Councilor Callahan.

761
01:19:32,704 --> 01:19:38,689
I was just going to say it's been a pleasure to be working with you all in this first year, my first year of being an elected official.

762
01:19:39,270 --> 01:19:46,295
I appreciate all the support that everyone has given in just understanding how things work and whom to talk to for information.

763
01:19:47,356 --> 01:19:50,499
And I really appreciate the way that we've been working together.

764
01:19:50,839 --> 01:19:51,840
Also appreciate the clerk.

765
01:19:52,020 --> 01:19:54,602
Thank you, Mr. Clerk, for all the work that you do for the city.

766
01:19:54,622 --> 01:19:56,464
Thank you, Councilor, appreciate it.

767
01:19:56,944 --> 01:20:04,332
Yes, and thanks to everyone who is tuning in, whether it's live or after the fact to any city council meeting.

768
01:20:05,033 --> 01:20:07,055
We appreciate your participation.

769
01:20:07,095 --> 01:20:08,176
We appreciate you keeping up.

770
01:20:09,357 --> 01:20:10,258
Appreciate the emails.

771
01:20:10,298 --> 01:20:11,800
We appreciate all the communication.

772
01:20:11,820 --> 01:20:16,024
And please do reach out and let us know what we can do for you in the new year.

773
01:20:18,885 --> 01:20:20,086
Thank you so much, Councilor Callahan.

774
01:20:20,106 --> 01:20:23,168
And yes, I want to echo your words of gratitude to the clerk.

775
01:20:24,069 --> 01:20:24,849
Thank you, Mr. Clerk.

776
01:20:25,950 --> 01:20:29,953
Thank you, team effort.

777
01:20:30,873 --> 01:20:44,943
It's really grateful for the collaboration that we've shared this year and very genuinely looking forward to collaborating with you all in the new year and excited to see how the governing agenda looks in another six months.

778
01:20:46,238 --> 01:20:48,100
and as always, yes, thank you for mentioning.

779
01:20:49,020 --> 01:20:52,984
Always appreciate the residents that take the time out of their week to be engaged in this process.

780
01:20:53,644 --> 01:20:58,849
Please join us, continue to join us in the new year, share your feedback, join these meetings, bring your friends.

781
01:20:59,929 --> 01:21:02,492
That is the point, that is the goal.

782
01:21:02,672 --> 01:21:04,213
We appreciate you being here and paying attention.

783
01:21:09,397 --> 01:21:10,798
Do I hear any motions?

784
01:21:10,858 --> 01:21:11,419
Motion to adjourn.

785
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:14,842
Motion to adjourn by Councilor Lemming, seconded by

786
01:21:15,882 --> 01:21:18,263
Councilor Callahan, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll when you're ready.

787
01:21:18,463 --> 01:21:21,103
Are you keeping the paper in committee as well, or are you just adjourning?

788
01:21:21,483 --> 01:21:23,364
Oh, we're gonna keep the paper in committee and adjourn.

789
01:21:23,384 --> 01:21:23,664
Thank you.

790
01:21:24,024 --> 01:21:24,364
Okay.

791
01:21:25,344 --> 01:21:25,644
All right.

792
01:21:25,664 --> 01:21:27,585
And I'll do the roll call.

793
01:21:29,945 --> 01:21:30,666

01:21:37,187 --> 01:21:37,387
Yes.

797
01:21:38,087 --> 01:21:38,467
Thank you.

Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Seng, and President Behrs are all absent.

801
01:21:45,406 --> 01:21:47,069
So Vice President Collins.

802

Yes.

803
01:21:49,092 --> 01:21:49,413
Thank you.

804
01:21:50,134 --> 01:21:51,116
Good night, everybody.
