00:00:04,458 --> 00:00:07,821
The following interview is of City Council candidate David Tedisco.

2
00:00:08,922 --> 00:00:15,728
Information for this introduction was taken from David's campaign website, which is linked in the show notes for further reading.

3
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:23,955
David has been working and volunteering in politics since his days as class president at Medford High School, a position he held for three years.

4
00:00:25,036 --> 00:00:28,999
At the age of 18, David interned for State Representative Sean Garibelli.

5
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:38,827
He also worked on Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign in New Hampshire, learning the importance of engaging with the community to understand the issues people faced.

6
00:00:39,788 --> 00:00:46,493
At the age of 19, David was asked to be the campaign coordinator for former Medford Mayor Stephanie Eugenie Burke.

7
00:00:48,163 --> 00:00:54,967
His time working with this campaign gave him a deeper insight into Medford politics and the challenges that Medford residents face today.

8
00:00:55,887 --> 00:00:57,668
Recently, David was working in D.C.

9
00:00:57,769 --> 00:01:03,652
in the office of Congresswoman Lori Trahan as his Press Secretary and Digital Director.

10
00:01:04,752 --> 00:01:17,680
In his campaign for City Council, David is focused on implementing a citywide infrastructure plan, modernizing city services, and revitalizing Medford Square into a thriving downtown area replete with diverse local businesses.

11
00:01:19,583 --> 00:01:23,210
Interviews for this podcast are done in a way to ensure COVID safety.

12
00:01:23,731 --> 00:01:27,878
For that reason, you may notice the sound of rain in the background of this episode.

13
00:01:28,579 --> 00:01:29,281
Thanks for listening.

14
00:01:34,949 --> 00:01:35,410
Hi, David.

15
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:36,932
Thanks so much for joining me today.

16
00:01:37,332 --> 00:01:38,714
Danielle, thank you for having me.

17
00:01:38,874 --> 00:01:39,675
This is amazing.

18
00:01:40,015 --> 00:01:40,776
Oh, no, no worries.

19
00:01:40,856 --> 00:01:41,757
I'm glad you could be here.

20
00:01:42,598 --> 00:01:48,384
So to start off, I've been asking folks that I interview about their favorite choice for a place to get a bite to eat in Medford.

21
00:01:48,404 --> 00:01:49,866
So what is yours?

22
00:01:50,146 --> 00:01:54,651
Well, I don't think it's much of a secret about me, but I'm Tenoch's biggest fan.

23
00:01:56,113 --> 00:01:57,634
Been going there since they opened.

24
00:01:58,235 --> 00:02:03,319
I was in high school, it was either 2014, and I remember I was at Papagino's in the square.

25
00:02:03,339 --> 00:02:07,642
I had just eaten a full pizza and I looked across the street and saw a burrito place.

26
00:02:08,423 --> 00:02:13,146
Keep in mind I weighed like 260 pounds at the time, but I looked across the street and I was like, a burrito?

27
00:02:13,647 --> 00:02:19,612
And I did have a full burrito after having this pizza and fell in love that day and have been going to Tenoch.

28
00:02:20,312 --> 00:02:24,274
ever since, but I try not to have both a full pizza and burrito consistently now.

29
00:02:24,474 --> 00:02:25,455
Try to do one or the other.

30
00:02:25,535 --> 00:02:27,836
That's a good adult life choice.

31
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:39,043
Yeah, trying to be healthier as an adult, not a high schooler, but yeah, just very Tenoch proud and always trying to send people there and order their food whenever I can.

32
00:02:39,603 --> 00:02:41,044
So is a burrito your go-to there?

33
00:02:42,064 --> 00:02:48,207
I actually, and I'm not going to pronounce this correctly, but plato mexicano, which is just like a burrito on a plate, pretty much.

34
00:02:48,827 --> 00:02:51,388
And it's rice, beans, and you can do chicken or steak.

35
00:02:51,469 --> 00:02:57,871
And their secret, a lot of people don't know about, is mole, which is their chocolate sauce that's spicy.

36
00:02:58,332 --> 00:03:00,673
It's not sweet, but it's really, really amazing.

37
00:03:00,753 --> 00:03:05,135
And I think Tenoch is such a great example of,

38
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:27,443
one of the really cool hidden gems in Medford and Medford Square, and just represents, right, the diversity we currently have in the local business scene and how do we continue to expand upon that and bring different cultures in, because we're all, you know, if you look down Medford Square on a Friday night, I think it's Nigea, the sushi, all-you-can-eat sushi place.

39
00:03:27,844 --> 00:03:29,205
There's like always a line out the door.

40
00:03:29,425 --> 00:03:30,105
It's unreal.

41
00:03:31,266 --> 00:03:33,848
So people really love these diverse options and, of course,

42
00:03:34,908 --> 00:03:35,469
day one.

43
00:03:35,749 --> 00:03:41,472
I grew up eating Bob's Subs in South Medford so I always have to do a shout out to Bob's as well.

44
00:03:42,372 --> 00:03:45,134
I love hearing other people's experiences of these places.

45
00:03:45,234 --> 00:03:50,237
Yeah I know and I'm trying to think like you know of course Medford Brewing is opening up on Harvard Ave.

46
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:51,277
Yeah it is Harvard Ave.

47
00:03:52,598 --> 00:04:05,683
hopefully in the next six months like we're you know just adding to the scene and it's it's exciting stuff and exciting like the direction we're going in of just having more and more uh different options on the menu you know so

48
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:07,140
Cool.

49
00:04:07,501 --> 00:04:11,004
You talked about your involvement in Medford.

50
00:04:11,044 --> 00:04:12,885
And we talked a little bit about it in the intro.

51
00:04:12,925 --> 00:04:17,790
And you've got a lot of experience interacting with local businesses.

52
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:26,137
But I'm just interested in hearing about what led you to run for city council and your path to local politics.

53
00:04:26,377 --> 00:04:28,900
Yeah, my path to local politics.

54
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:35,246
So I was a junior in high school and my brother Dennis was really successful.

55
00:04:35,306 --> 00:04:43,795
He started a clothing company at the time and like a larger brand called Karma Loop bought his brand and he was doing really great.

56
00:04:44,235 --> 00:04:47,678
And so I said to myself, I want to go into business because I want to make money because that's

57
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:48,919
That's cool.

58
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:55,944
And then junior year history, I had a teacher named Jonathan Streff, who's still at the high school now.

59
00:04:56,725 --> 00:05:00,948
And I somehow, by the skin of my teeth, got into APUS.

60
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:03,109
I think it was APUS history.

61
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:13,114
And he just opened my eyes to the importance of civic engagement and being a part of something so much greater than yourself.

62
00:05:14,415 --> 00:05:21,618
And so it's when I kind of changed my focus to maybe I don't want to go to business school, maybe I want to get involved in public life.

63
00:05:23,925 --> 00:05:30,652
Even though, and it's so true, and I learned this lesson later on, jobs don't pay well in the public sector.

64
00:05:30,712 --> 00:05:38,099
So, you know, it's really an issue of equity and making the sector more attractive so we have people invest more in our society.

65
00:05:40,265 --> 00:05:52,974
But yeah, I mean, Jonathan Streff, he was the type of guy that, I mean, on the weekends, he was a national park ranger at JFK's birth home in Brookline and would do civil war reenactments on the weekend.

66
00:05:53,155 --> 00:05:57,978
Like this is a guy that currently lives and breathes the history, you know?

67
00:05:58,018 --> 00:06:00,300
So he really just spread that passion.

68
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:04,103
And the funny thing is, if you look at my campaign today, right, my campaign,

69
00:06:06,393 --> 00:06:22,923
Our core team, it's a ton of people from my high school class and specifically a lot of students that had strep in particular and I think they kind of caught the bug the same way I did of this is so cool and exciting and you're part of something so much greater than just you.

70
00:06:23,643 --> 00:06:26,965
So that was when I kind of mentally got first invested in politics.

71
00:06:29,518 --> 00:06:37,561
Then I went, you know, after Medford High, I went to UMass Lowell, and I remember I was at the club fair, and there was like a huge Donald Trump table.

72
00:06:38,581 --> 00:06:43,463
And this was at UMass Lowell, which I perceived to be like a more, you know, democratic university.

73
00:06:44,243 --> 00:06:50,005
And of course, there's strength and diversity of opinions, but I was just disheartened that I didn't see like a college Democrats table.

74
00:06:50,586 --> 00:06:54,347
So I went over to the Trump table, and I said, where's the college Democrats?

75
00:06:54,407 --> 00:06:56,708
And they, you know, they just smiled and said, they don't exist.

76
00:06:57,728 --> 00:06:58,849
And I couldn't believe it.

77
00:06:58,909 --> 00:07:01,690
So I started College Democrats at UMass Lowell.

78
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:04,972
I mean, it's still going today, a really strong organization.

79
00:07:05,052 --> 00:07:10,716
But it was exciting because at the time, a congressional primary was going on.

80
00:07:11,436 --> 00:07:16,039
Nikki Songhus, who represented the Merrimack Valley, was stepping down.

81
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:21,442
And so I met basically all the candidates because they wanted to come in and talk to our club.

82
00:07:21,462 --> 00:07:23,383
They wanted to get young people involved.

83
00:07:24,283 --> 00:07:27,987
in civic life and really get college Democrats on board their campaigns.

84
00:07:28,027 --> 00:07:31,691
So I met Rufus Gifford, Dan Coe, Lori Trahan.

85
00:07:33,702 --> 00:07:36,104
I ended up joining Rufus Gifford's campaign.

86
00:07:36,584 --> 00:07:41,468
And Rufus was the fundraiser for President Obama.

87
00:07:41,668 --> 00:07:43,990
He was later appointed ambassador to Denmark.

88
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:53,437
He was so deep in public life and really saw the importance of being involved and playing your role in whatever capacity that may be.

89
00:07:54,768 --> 00:07:56,429
Rufus came in fifth place.

90
00:07:57,649 --> 00:08:01,090
That race didn't work out, but Rufus inspired me so much.

91
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:02,951
So many things about Rufus.

92
00:08:02,971 --> 00:08:05,811
You know, he was an openly gay candidate running for Congress.

93
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:09,593
I was very much and always am in the process of coming out, right?

94
00:08:09,613 --> 00:08:11,773
Because everyone you meet, you're always coming out to.

95
00:08:11,813 --> 00:08:15,274
It's like introducing any other element of your personality.

96
00:08:15,834 --> 00:08:17,055
But he just really inspired me.

97
00:08:17,075 --> 00:08:23,097
He was so proud and secure of who he was and had such a vision and passion for what America should be.

98
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:26,439
And so I joined Rufus.

99
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:27,199
It didn't work out.

100
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:33,121
I ended up getting a scholarship to American University and going to grad school in Washington, DC.

101
00:08:33,941 --> 00:08:35,581
And I'm sitting there.

102
00:08:35,641 --> 00:08:37,002
I got a job in admissions.

103
00:08:37,662 --> 00:08:44,964
And I'm thinking, I know so much about this congressional district in Massachusetts, 37 cities and towns.

104
00:08:45,364 --> 00:08:47,264
And this knowledge is just being wasted.

105
00:08:47,844 --> 00:08:50,245
And so I called up Lori Trahan, who had won.

106
00:08:50,265 --> 00:08:51,605
And I knew of her.

107
00:08:51,645 --> 00:08:52,145
And she knew of me.

108
00:08:52,165 --> 00:08:53,966
And I was still very supportive of her.

109
00:08:55,766 --> 00:08:59,888
And after enough pestering, she said, all right, I'll take you on board.

110
00:08:59,928 --> 00:09:02,709
So I ended up joining her office, I think, February.

111
00:09:02,949 --> 00:09:04,269
She got it sworn in in January.

112
00:09:04,329 --> 00:09:05,750
I joined her team in February.

113
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:10,911
Started off as her digital assistant, and then became her digital director and press secretary.

114
00:09:12,872 --> 00:09:22,101
And so that kind of takes me up to the point when I started to think about running for city council because what happened in my life happened in everyone else's life.

115
00:09:22,121 --> 00:09:25,484
The COVID-19 pandemic hit and kind of rocked everyone's world.

116
00:09:27,918 --> 00:09:40,722
And so I started watching city council meetings over Zoom because at the federal level, we were working on these large spending bills, the CARES package, the American Rescue Plan, the Families First Act, right?

117
00:09:40,742 --> 00:09:44,223
All these big, big spending bills filled with COVID-19 relief.

118
00:09:44,243 --> 00:09:45,503
And there was a lot in them.

119
00:09:45,523 --> 00:09:46,804
There was small business relief.

120
00:09:47,184 --> 00:09:50,165
There was testing resources, vaccine funding.

121
00:09:51,965 --> 00:09:54,869
simple things like PPE, right, the personal protective equipment.

122
00:09:55,590 --> 00:10:02,619
And so I was watching city council to see how are we talking about these big spending bills at the local level.

123
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,882
You know, I know how we're talking about them at the U.S.

124
00:10:04,902 --> 00:10:06,204
Capitol, what's going on at home.

125
00:10:08,877 --> 00:10:16,400
I tuned in, and I think I experienced what a lot of residents experience, which was really shocked by the state of the council.

126
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,501
It was really divided.

127
00:10:18,521 --> 00:10:23,163
The discourse got really low at times, and I know it was a tough two years.

128
00:10:23,243 --> 00:10:26,484
But I've elected you to represent me and 58,000 other people.

129
00:10:29,265 --> 00:10:35,289
And I just always hope we keep the bar high and always maintain respect even when we disagree.

130
00:10:35,489 --> 00:10:41,053
We can disagree on opinion, but acknowledge we're still neighbors, right?

131
00:10:41,193 --> 00:10:44,015
And the important thing is that we need to educate each other.

132
00:10:44,175 --> 00:10:51,559
We need to educate each other about our stances so that you understand why I believe black lives matter and why I believe love is love, right?

133
00:10:51,599 --> 00:10:52,560
These are important things.

134
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,421
It's not just a lawn sign.

135
00:10:54,441 --> 00:10:56,623
These affect people's lives and well-being.

136
00:10:59,029 --> 00:11:08,838
And so I just, you know, it was also the peak of the Black Lives Matter movement, and I was working in lockstep with Mobilize Medford, and we organized a letter which went out.

137
00:11:09,479 --> 00:11:18,087
Over 700 residents signed on to this letter, which basically said, hey, city administrators, thanks so much for declaring racism a public health crisis.

138
00:11:18,388 --> 00:11:19,609
It really was an important thing, right?

139
00:11:19,629 --> 00:11:20,209
It unlocked

140
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:25,374
special funding from the state that we wouldn't receive had we not declared that.

141
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:28,216
But many also saw it as a Band-Aid solution.

142
00:11:28,476 --> 00:11:31,819
What did that really do beyond that wonderful claim?

143
00:11:32,299 --> 00:11:34,221
What are we doing to make systemic change?

144
00:11:35,662 --> 00:11:43,628
And so this letter we wrote outlined six different priorities of here are things you can do in the city of Medford to actually make Medford more equitable.

145
00:11:43,648 --> 00:11:48,032
And I think that's where it gets into many other policy areas, which I'm happy to dive into.

146
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:53,725
And so the response to that was really nothing.

147
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:57,509
Some folks emailed back, but there was no follow-up.

148
00:11:57,589 --> 00:11:59,651
There was no actionable change.

149
00:12:00,312 --> 00:12:03,094
And so I took a step back, and you look at the bigger picture.

150
00:12:03,114 --> 00:12:05,156
And you say, all right, we're not really delivering.

151
00:12:06,317 --> 00:12:08,098
for every population in Medford.

152
00:12:08,138 --> 00:12:10,500
We're not really delivering on the basic services.

153
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,341
I mean, I looked at, right, I live in North Medford.

154
00:12:12,641 --> 00:12:14,862
You look at the state of the streets and the sidewalks.

155
00:12:15,483 --> 00:12:18,204
And that's what I got my master's in was public administration.

156
00:12:18,224 --> 00:12:25,268
And my degree was really focused on municipal planning and infrastructure and finance and the intersectionality of all these issues.

157
00:12:27,768 --> 00:12:34,612
And so I just, I said to myself, we're really not delivering so many of the basic things that our neighbors are.

158
00:12:35,432 --> 00:12:40,115
Malden is, Somerville is, Cambridge is, Melrose is, on a lot of these issues.

159
00:12:40,815 --> 00:12:43,636
And so I said to myself, all right, we need new blood in Medford.

160
00:12:44,717 --> 00:12:48,139
I'll be honest, I've always been more of a behind the scenes guy, right?

161
00:12:48,179 --> 00:12:51,820
I worked for Mayor Burke, managed her campaign in 2017.

162
00:12:53,161 --> 00:12:59,183
I worked on the Biden campaign from home, making calls all day, worked on Secretary Clinton's campaign.

163
00:12:59,224 --> 00:13:02,285
Like, you know, I've always been behind the scenes working on these elements.

164
00:13:02,665 --> 00:13:09,788
Never pictured myself as a candidate until I was talking to a lot of my friends and family this spring about, you know, who are we gonna run?

165
00:13:10,368 --> 00:13:13,450
Asking around, I'll happily manage a campaign.

166
00:13:14,211 --> 00:13:16,354
And a few folks were like, well, why don't you just run?

167
00:13:16,915 --> 00:13:17,475
Why don't you run?

168
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:21,682
And I said, well, you know, I don't know if that's right for me right now.

169
00:13:21,782 --> 00:13:27,690
I had already moved home because the pandemic got so bad that I decided to move home.

170
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:36,197
mid-2020 because I was paying rent in DC, but because I could be home, I was home.

171
00:13:36,537 --> 00:13:39,519
I said, why am I paying rent in DC when I really want to be back in Medford?

172
00:13:39,939 --> 00:13:44,142
The idea was to move there, get the degree, and come back home, and that just really happened to work out.

173
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:56,252
That's, you know, the pandemic had very few silver linings, but I view them as, that is one of them of, it really prompted this internal look on yourself.

174
00:13:56,332 --> 00:13:57,193
What do you prioritize?

175
00:13:57,213 --> 00:13:57,993
What do you want in life?

176
00:13:58,433 --> 00:14:02,634
And I realized, like, I'm not spending enough time with my family, especially in a public health crisis.

177
00:14:02,654 --> 00:14:05,955
You realize not everyone's here for as long as you'd like them to be.

178
00:14:05,975 --> 00:14:08,235
So you've got to spend time with those that mean the world to you.

179
00:14:10,756 --> 00:14:12,557
So I know I went a little bit all over the map here.

180
00:14:12,597 --> 00:14:12,837
Sorry.

181
00:14:12,877 --> 00:14:18,760
EMILY FORTUNA No, you touched on a lot of the different things that I was going to ask you.

182
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:23,702
Sort of like what your observations have been, what you'd like to change, or what you'd like to see done differently.

183
00:14:24,262 --> 00:14:25,923
And I also would agree.

184
00:14:28,764 --> 00:14:32,327
Lots of people have become more engaged in local politics and watching the city council.

185
00:14:32,647 --> 00:14:37,871
The access with Zoom, for me at least, made things really easy to participate.

186
00:14:37,991 --> 00:14:39,352
And we need to keep that, right?

187
00:14:39,412 --> 00:14:43,275
That is dropping the barriers to civic engagement.

188
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:46,518
How are we allowing a city like Medford, right?

189
00:14:46,558 --> 00:14:47,499
We're not Boston.

190
00:14:47,719 --> 00:14:51,802
We don't have the press that Boston has or even Cambridge or Somerville.

191
00:14:52,062 --> 00:14:59,447
We're lucky to have the transcript, and Kinga, who's a new reporter here in Medford, we're lucky to have her in the organization.

192
00:14:59,467 --> 00:15:01,348
But we always need more coverage.

193
00:15:01,929 --> 00:15:06,131
And the most important thing we can do is expose people directly to government.

194
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:09,053
See what the people you've elected are like.

195
00:15:09,353 --> 00:15:10,114
How do they talk?

196
00:15:10,174 --> 00:15:11,134
What do they care about?

197
00:15:11,475 --> 00:15:13,216
Are they reflecting your priorities?

198
00:15:15,117 --> 00:15:22,446
And I think over the last two years, a lot of us had that internal look, you know, looking in the mirror as a city.

199
00:15:23,087 --> 00:15:26,211
What do we want to prioritize over the next two years?

200
00:15:28,337 --> 00:15:35,424
And so yeah, that is why Zoom is so important and in any barrier for anyone to get engaged in the conversation is critical.

201
00:15:35,824 --> 00:15:45,453
And there's so many ways that we can open up the conversation to make city government more accessible to all different populations that historically have been shut out of the conversation.

202
00:15:46,414 --> 00:15:49,877
But I just want to touch upon why this moment matters.

203
00:15:51,178 --> 00:15:56,182
We have $48 million coming to the city of Medford from the American Rescue Plan.

204
00:15:56,743 --> 00:15:58,644
And I know some folks are starting to talk about this.

205
00:15:59,485 --> 00:16:08,933
I've been mentioning this since May on the campaign trail because I worked on the messaging of the legislation back when I was working for the Congresswoman.

206
00:16:08,973 --> 00:16:14,298
So I was very mindful of this huge influx of federal funds coming to Medford.

207
00:16:15,739 --> 00:16:18,920
We're adding about a whole fourth to our regular municipal budget.

208
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:24,683
I mean, it's really a remarkable opportunity to get through some serious backlog on projects, right?

209
00:16:25,144 --> 00:16:28,525
Of course, first and foremost, we should be prioritizing the public health crisis.

210
00:16:28,846 --> 00:16:30,767
That's what these dollars were dedicated for.

211
00:16:31,307 --> 00:16:32,428
So, Medford High School.

212
00:16:33,441 --> 00:16:35,424
I graduated Medford High in 2015.

213
00:16:36,005 --> 00:16:37,026
I was class president.

214
00:16:37,547 --> 00:16:43,235
Couldn't have been more proud of the people in that building and the educators and the administrators and the student body.

215
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:46,480
The physical building is lacking dramatically.

216
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,883
I'm not the only one to notice this, of course.

217
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:53,073
but we still don't have proper ventilation at the high school.

218
00:16:53,693 --> 00:17:02,341
You know, we can claim we do because we've unlocked some metal windows that were locked up in the 80s or 90s, but that doesn't mean we have proper ventilation.

219
00:17:02,881 --> 00:17:04,442
You know, the other element is,

220
00:17:06,499 --> 00:17:09,140
There is that conversation about do we get a new high school.

221
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:14,763
You know, we've invested so much in B building and the new pool and the new field of dreams.

222
00:17:15,703 --> 00:17:18,044
But the important thing is we've got to start that conversation.

223
00:17:18,084 --> 00:17:20,585
This project is going to take seven years no matter what.

224
00:17:21,346 --> 00:17:23,987
And how can these federal funds assist with that?

225
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:27,629
So I think first and foremost, right, if a new high school is going to take seven years,

226
00:17:28,409 --> 00:17:32,071
we should be updating the ventilation immediately, immediately with these federal funds.

227
00:17:32,091 --> 00:17:33,551
That's what they were dedicated for.

228
00:17:33,831 --> 00:17:35,412
And I'm talking about air controlled rooms.

229
00:17:35,492 --> 00:17:40,154
You know, it is against state law for a public facility to be above 80 degrees Fahrenheit.

230
00:17:40,574 --> 00:17:43,455
Yet it happens at Medford High every September, May, and June.

231
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:45,736
And that's because it was grandfathered in.

232
00:17:45,917 --> 00:17:48,057
It was built before the state law was put in place.

233
00:17:48,438 --> 00:17:51,419
But the reality is, is the state law was put in place for a reason.

234
00:17:51,819 --> 00:17:53,600
It's unsafe for students with disability.

235
00:17:55,101 --> 00:18:04,387
And unsafe, you know, in general, if you can't focus because you're so uncomfortable in a hot room, how are you paying attention to your education?

236
00:18:05,008 --> 00:18:07,510
And this is where we fall behind compared to our neighbors.

237
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:17,917
You know, if you think about it, a student sweating in a classroom in Medford, probably not going to get as good grades as a student who's very comfortable in Winchester, just able to easily pay attention to the curriculum.

238
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:21,019
That is where the gap begins to grow when we don't invest.

239
00:18:23,247 --> 00:18:42,474
And so that's why these federal funds are a really exciting opportunity, getting proper ventilation at the high school, starting an infrastructure plan across the city of Medford to update our streets and our sidewalks, not only so that they're well paved, but that they're ADA compliant, and being mindful of climate resiliency every step of the way.

240
00:18:43,514 --> 00:18:45,535
I'm not going to claim I'm the climate expert.

241
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:51,244
I think that's a problem right now with any leader in this country who's elected.

242
00:18:51,665 --> 00:18:52,946
You don't have to be the expert.

243
00:18:53,286 --> 00:18:56,189
You didn't get a PhD in environmental policy.

244
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:58,852
But your job is to get those people in the room.

245
00:18:59,252 --> 00:19:01,294
Have them advise you on what is best.

246
00:19:01,735 --> 00:19:04,117
The public health crisis showed that best, right?

247
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:05,719
You don't have to be the doctor.

248
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:17,124
but get the doctor in the room to tell you the best thing, not Facebook, but a real medical professional to tell you, you know, should you be wearing a mask?

249
00:19:17,184 --> 00:19:18,225
Should you get vaccinated?

250
00:19:18,345 --> 00:19:19,545
Let them do the research.

251
00:19:19,585 --> 00:19:20,446
That's their job.

252
00:19:20,846 --> 00:19:21,706
And you do your job.

253
00:19:21,726 --> 00:19:23,047
Maybe your job's an educator.

254
00:19:23,087 --> 00:19:24,187
Maybe your job's a coach.

255
00:19:24,227 --> 00:19:28,369
Maybe your job is working at a grocery store or helping pave a road.

256
00:19:28,409 --> 00:19:35,472
I mean, we all play such a critical role in society and let the experts do what they've studied, you know?

257
00:19:37,373 --> 00:19:45,462
Yeah, no, and it sounds like you have a lot of things that you would like to change or like to continue seeing work done on in the city.

258
00:19:46,022 --> 00:19:47,544
Do you have any thoughts about equity?

259
00:19:47,784 --> 00:19:54,331
You've addressed this in a little bit of your response already, but what Medford would need to become more equitable?

260
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:54,971
Yeah.

261
00:19:55,111 --> 00:20:11,976
And I know a few other candidates have touched upon this in the pod series as well, which real quick, just before I jump into equity, I just want to say like, Danielle, the fact that you wrote about this podcast on Facebook a week and a half ago, and it is up and running now, and you have four episodes.

262
00:20:12,056 --> 00:20:12,897
It's just remarkable.

263
00:20:12,937 --> 00:20:15,978
And I think that's so symbolic of Medford residents.

264
00:20:16,018 --> 00:20:18,738
Like we have an idea and we want to put it to action.

265
00:20:18,798 --> 00:20:20,519
We just need a government that matches that.

266
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:28,588
But I've just been so blown away by how you got this up and running, and a brand, and a logo, and it's on Spotify.

267
00:20:29,769 --> 00:20:31,011
I'm very, very impressed.

268
00:20:31,171 --> 00:20:33,714
So thank you for doing that and moving so fast.

269
00:20:35,096 --> 00:20:35,796
Back to equity.

270
00:20:36,738 --> 00:20:41,703
Also to say, I couldn't have done it without the accessibility of the candidates that have come on.

271
00:20:41,723 --> 00:20:44,487
They've made it sort of easy to schedule things.

272
00:20:44,587 --> 00:20:45,728
That is awesome, right.

273
00:20:46,089 --> 00:20:52,616
And that's where a responsive government comes into the conversation, especially folks who are running to be your elected officials.

274
00:20:55,658 --> 00:21:03,801
Charter review, and if you've listened to other episodes, I apologize for repeating what charter review is, but charter review is basically our local constitution.

275
00:21:04,081 --> 00:21:06,442
It is how do we decide what our government looks like?

276
00:21:07,022 --> 00:21:09,203
We haven't done this in Medford in 38 years.

277
00:21:09,963 --> 00:21:14,004
Most communities build in an internal review every five to 10 years.

278
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:14,905
It's just a given.

279
00:21:15,725 --> 00:21:21,387
And I think that's intentional for many reasons that we haven't had that review.

280
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:28,204
What we desperately need in Medford is ward representation and at-large representation.

281
00:21:28,764 --> 00:21:31,987
Right now, I believe, Medford, we have eight wards in Medford.

282
00:21:32,247 --> 00:21:34,329
Two of our eight wards are represented on the council.

283
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:37,331
Eight of our eight wards should be represented on the council.

284
00:21:38,332 --> 00:21:40,853
And so it's a system Malden has.

285
00:21:40,993 --> 00:21:43,213
It's worked incredibly well for them.

286
00:21:44,173 --> 00:21:44,893
Somerville has it.

287
00:21:44,933 --> 00:21:46,494
Cambridge has it.

288
00:21:47,374 --> 00:21:55,396
It allows each neighborhood to be more engaged, to have someone more responsive to their issues, and actually have a city council that looks like the city of Medford.

289
00:21:55,936 --> 00:22:00,617
And so I think that that's a domino effect for equity across the city, right?

290
00:22:02,317 --> 00:22:08,559
I got asked this question, what can we do to welcome more minority businesses to the city of Medford, minority-owned businesses?

291
00:22:09,739 --> 00:22:10,600
There's a number of things.

292
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:12,320
We could have the chamber reach out more.

293
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:20,142
We could ensure our city communications are multilingual, consistently, not just here or there, but across the board.

294
00:22:22,284 --> 00:22:29,354
make government services and communications much more accessible through a 3-1-1 system and easily access City Hall 24-7.

295
00:22:30,115 --> 00:22:36,204
But really, I would imagine if you're opening up, let's say, a pizza shop in Medford,

296
00:22:37,385 --> 00:22:41,028
you're going to look at what do the local elected officials look like?

297
00:22:41,188 --> 00:22:42,229
What does the scene look like?

298
00:22:42,709 --> 00:22:45,992
And then you might decide from there, is this the community that's right for my business?

299
00:22:46,472 --> 00:22:53,157
If we have a city council that actually looks like the population of Medford, I'm sure minority-owned businesses would feel more comfortable opening up shop here.

300
00:22:53,798 --> 00:22:57,921
We only have one black-owned business in Medford, Neighborhood Kitchen, which is great.

301
00:22:58,701 --> 00:23:01,003
But how do we open that up?

302
00:23:01,203 --> 00:23:06,007
You know, in talking about, we have so much opportunity coming, Mystic Avenue, right?

303
00:23:07,317 --> 00:23:14,359
I know that we've had a lot of folks kind of stop the progress that should have happened already on Mystic Avenue when you start talking about our housing shortage.

304
00:23:14,959 --> 00:23:17,179
And we have a housing crisis in Medford.

305
00:23:17,539 --> 00:23:18,920
My generation is boxed out.

306
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:19,700
We're boxed out.

307
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,800
I graduated Medford High in 2015.

308
00:23:22,561 --> 00:23:32,423
Most of my friends have moved to a big city because they're like, well, I could stay here until I'm 40 and save up with my parents and then buy a house.

309
00:23:32,883 --> 00:23:35,284
Or I could go start my life in another city and start renting.

310
00:23:37,428 --> 00:23:43,214
The funny thing is, right, if you look at a lot of spaces to rent in Medford, it's outrageous.

311
00:23:43,734 --> 00:23:46,637
Locust Street apartments are about $3,000 for a studio.

312
00:23:47,278 --> 00:23:47,818
I looked there.

313
00:23:47,838 --> 00:23:50,161
I was like, OK, this is not realistic.

314
00:23:50,561 --> 00:23:51,622
I was renting in DC.

315
00:23:51,662 --> 00:23:53,284
My studio was $1,500 a month.

316
00:23:53,524 --> 00:23:56,387
That was already way too much money, $1,500 a month.

317
00:23:56,467 --> 00:24:00,270
We're talking studios and one bedrooms at $3,000 in Medford.

318
00:24:02,172 --> 00:24:04,354
And so how do we curb that issue, right?

319
00:24:04,374 --> 00:24:05,675
And this is all in line with equity.

320
00:24:05,855 --> 00:24:07,276
This all falls under the question.

321
00:24:09,317 --> 00:24:12,339
We don't have an Office of Affordable Housing in Medford.

322
00:24:12,379 --> 00:24:14,381
We don't have a land trust.

323
00:24:15,301 --> 00:24:19,464
There are a lot of actions we can take to really move forward in that space.

324
00:24:20,945 --> 00:24:29,713
And to me, Mystic Avenue is that golden opportunity of revising our zoning laws, looking at how do we make this space work for affordable housing.

325
00:24:29,773 --> 00:24:35,119
I mean, not to mention Medford is currently, I think it's either 7 or 8% out of affordable housing citywide right now.

326
00:24:35,479 --> 00:24:37,120
By state law, we're supposed to be at 10%.

327
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:39,663
So once again, we're breaking state law.

328
00:24:41,625 --> 00:24:48,512
That's where you allow those 40 Bs, which are apartment buildings that are 20% affordable housing, to open up here in Medford.

329
00:24:48,532 --> 00:24:51,294
We've had multiple proposals and yet we pumped the brakes on them.

330
00:24:52,656 --> 00:24:56,380
I think Medford's at the point where we've been pumping the brakes for so long.

331
00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:03,607
Medford in so many ways, when you look at the physical elements, not the cultural, not the people, but the physical elements, it feels like we're in 1960.

332
00:25:05,148 --> 00:25:13,631
When you look at the layout of Medford Square, when you look at our housing stock, when you look at Mystic Ave, these are incredible opportunities.

333
00:25:13,912 --> 00:25:17,053
And you look at Malden downtown, they flipped in the past five years.

334
00:25:17,553 --> 00:25:21,194
They are accessible, they are walkable, they have public transportation.

335
00:25:21,495 --> 00:25:23,475
That's what we need to be fighting for in Medford.

336
00:25:23,936 --> 00:25:26,917
And we need champions at the local level that are advocating for this.

337
00:25:28,101 --> 00:25:30,503
Medford Square, I'm nearly 25, right?

338
00:25:31,364 --> 00:25:33,086
Medford Square has been a conversation my whole life.

339
00:25:33,707 --> 00:25:35,829
We're gonna get to work on Medford Square.

340
00:25:35,849 --> 00:25:43,956
And I had, I won't lie, I had points of sincere hope when there were, there's been three different redraws of Medford Square.

341
00:25:44,477 --> 00:25:45,718
We don't need another study.

342
00:25:45,978 --> 00:25:48,040
We don't need another redraw of Medford Square.

343
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,221
Nothing's changed since then.

344
00:25:49,982 --> 00:25:50,302
We need a

345
00:25:50,943 --> 00:25:53,885
put that plan in action and put the shovel in the ground and get to work.

346
00:25:54,385 --> 00:26:00,009
I think the reason we kick that can down the road is because construction is going to be uncomfortable and people are going to be upset.

347
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:04,532
The construction is worth it on the flip side, but I think that's why we continue to push it because

348
00:26:05,813 --> 00:26:10,435
truly redrawing Medford Square is going to be uncomfortable for residents, for small businesses.

349
00:26:10,455 --> 00:26:12,436
There's going to have to be temporary solutions.

350
00:26:13,136 --> 00:26:15,958
But now it's been 25 years of avoiding the conversation.

351
00:26:16,718 --> 00:26:18,919
You're letting me talk for too long.

352
00:26:18,999 --> 00:26:20,420
I got a question about the charter.

353
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:27,483
So if that were to happen, would it, it would be an option to go to at-large representation where you'd have to vote on that?

354
00:26:27,603 --> 00:26:38,329
I'm so glad you asked about this because I made a mental note that this process, there's a lot of misinformation about this process on the public front.

355
00:26:38,389 --> 00:26:39,830
I think that's no one's fault.

356
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:41,170
No one really explains it to us.

357
00:26:41,711 --> 00:26:44,932
But the way it works is the council votes for the review.

358
00:26:45,953 --> 00:26:49,017
That then goes to the statehouse and is voted on at the statehouse.

359
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:55,084
What the statehouse is voting on is just to start a commission to evaluate our charter.

360
00:26:55,845 --> 00:27:01,972
The commission then comes up with a proposed charter, which is then voted on by the community.

361
00:27:02,713 --> 00:27:09,117
It's a long process to even get to that point, which is why so many candidates are talking about this with urgency.

362
00:27:09,437 --> 00:27:15,642
We understand if we even get to work immediately, we have a two-year road ahead of us before we even have something tangible in front of us.

363
00:27:17,323 --> 00:27:21,345
But that commission will make a recommendation about the charter.

364
00:27:21,385 --> 00:27:24,928
So it can include things like ward representation and at large.

365
00:27:25,588 --> 00:27:31,352
It can include, you know, term limits, which I'm very incredibly in favor of.

366
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:36,214
But of course, you know, just because I'm in favor of it doesn't mean it needs to happen.

367
00:27:36,254 --> 00:27:49,499
Like I understand that if I'm fortunate enough to be elected that I'd be representing 58,000 people and always want to listen to folks from all walks of life and every opinion and then evaluate from there what makes the most sense for a city like Medford.

368
00:27:50,859 --> 00:27:54,321
You know, it reviews the power balance between the mayor and the council.

369
00:27:55,221 --> 00:27:57,422
We have a really, really strong mayor in Medford.

370
00:27:58,742 --> 00:28:05,308
Like, you know, Malden also has a strong mayor, but they don't yield as much power as the mayor does in Medford.

371
00:28:05,368 --> 00:28:06,729
And it's a lot on the mayor.

372
00:28:06,869 --> 00:28:09,511
It's a lot, because they basically, every decision falls under them.

373
00:28:09,851 --> 00:28:10,812
That's a large decision.

374
00:28:10,832 --> 00:28:14,094
You know, our council passes the budget, and they can do a lot of resolutions.

375
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:19,619
But a lot of big initiatives, it's on the shoulders of the mayor to do that in two years.

376
00:28:19,639 --> 00:28:20,620
You have two years.

377
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:26,222
to prove yourself, and really you have 12 months to prove yourself before you're in re-election again.

378
00:28:26,622 --> 00:28:27,562
That's a lot to ask.

379
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:29,283
Working for Stephanie, I saw that.

380
00:28:30,203 --> 00:28:41,307
I was blown away by what Stephanie could do in four years between, you know, funding the incredible project that was the police station, that was a lot of money, getting a brand new library, Riverside Park.

381
00:28:41,327 --> 00:28:46,009
Those are just a few things that I was like, wow, that's what a really strong administrator can do in a few years.

382
00:28:47,369 --> 00:28:49,951
But she was always fighting off her real act, you know, and that's tough.

383
00:28:49,971 --> 00:28:54,873
So I think charter review just to get to a healthier place would be a four-year mayor.

384
00:28:54,974 --> 00:28:59,256
To have anyone who's mayor just be more productive in that office, you know.

385
00:28:59,756 --> 00:29:04,759
Yeah, and you've shared a lot about the community of Medford, and it's clear that you have a lot that you appreciate about it.

386
00:29:05,819 --> 00:29:07,120
Sorry if I'm going on.

387
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:08,361
No, you're good.

388
00:29:09,441 --> 00:29:10,361
It's very informative.

389
00:29:10,421 --> 00:29:15,883
I think that's part of what I'm enjoying about this process is getting a deeper understanding of some of these issues.

390
00:29:15,963 --> 00:29:18,283
We just hear the terms, and they're not clear what they mean.

391
00:29:18,303 --> 00:29:21,544
TODD KERPELMAN So many people have explained charter review to you at this point.

392
00:29:21,584 --> 00:29:22,304
I feel bad.

393
00:29:22,884 --> 00:29:25,005
And I know it's more to get the word out there.

394
00:29:25,025 --> 00:29:28,206
But thanks for bearing with all the candidates while we explain this.

395
00:29:29,226 --> 00:29:33,047
It took me months as a candidate to understand this process.

396
00:29:34,627 --> 00:29:37,448
Being a candidate has been so informative.

397
00:29:37,528 --> 00:29:41,470
I mean, I can't tell you how much I know about trees now.

398
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:45,672
I knew the importance of trees, but I don't think I understood in depth.

399
00:29:46,152 --> 00:29:50,314
Like, some trees have a life of 90 years, you know, the same as a human.

400
00:29:51,615 --> 00:29:53,155
I just, I never thought of it that way.

401
00:29:53,175 --> 00:29:55,577
Growing up, I was like, trees live for hundreds of years.

402
00:29:55,897 --> 00:29:58,338
And that is true about some trees, but not all species.

403
00:29:59,858 --> 00:30:03,320
In trees, right, talking about equity, trees are an issue of equity.

404
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:09,423
South Medford, South Medford, some streets have one tree on the entire street.

405
00:30:10,143 --> 00:30:12,004
That is not true in Western North Medford.

406
00:30:12,024 --> 00:30:19,647
And even in Western North Medford, there are still hundreds of tree stumps without, there should be a living tree where those tree stumps are.

407
00:30:21,368 --> 00:30:29,873
And so I'm incredibly in favor of expanding our forestry budget to really dramatically beef up our tree canopy in Medford.

408
00:30:30,353 --> 00:30:32,014
And it all comes down to funding, right?

409
00:30:32,034 --> 00:30:33,095
A lot of people are like, how can we do it?

410
00:30:33,115 --> 00:30:34,276
It all comes down to funding.

411
00:30:34,356 --> 00:30:41,240
So again, that 48 million will help, but revising Mystic Avenue to increase tax revenue is going to help.

412
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:46,043
And then if the community wants to look at it, you know, a lot of people talk about a two and a half override.

413
00:30:46,543 --> 00:30:50,625
And it's a really contentious issue in this community because people feel strongly on both sides.

414
00:30:50,645 --> 00:30:56,527
I do hear a lot of people say, I'll admit that, a lot of people say, I'll pay the taxes if you're going to give me the service.

415
00:30:57,128 --> 00:31:01,069
People don't want to pay the tax if they're kind of getting what they're getting right now, which I understand that.

416
00:31:01,149 --> 00:31:01,910
They're not getting much.

417
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:04,651
And that's not a bash on anyone.

418
00:31:04,671 --> 00:31:10,913
This is like generations long issue of us kind of dialing services back in the city of Medford.

419
00:31:12,914 --> 00:31:16,716
But, you know, if the community is in favor of two and a half overhead, that should be a valid question.

420
00:31:16,856 --> 00:31:18,156
That should go up to the community.

421
00:31:18,676 --> 00:31:27,240
That shouldn't be decided by any elected official because, you know, I am one person and I have my life, my income, my scenario, my housing.

422
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:30,821
I don't have the same scenario as 58,000 other people.

423
00:31:30,861 --> 00:31:33,082
We have to be mindful of everyone's situation.

424
00:31:34,022 --> 00:31:41,407
For example, as I was door-knocking North Medford, I talked to a lot of seniors that said, David, I'm excited.

425
00:31:41,427 --> 00:31:46,610
I just want you to know if you increase taxes, I'll probably lose my home.

426
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:47,711
I'm widowed.

427
00:31:47,731 --> 00:31:49,111
I live on Social Security.

428
00:31:50,012 --> 00:31:50,952
I'll lose this house.

429
00:31:51,973 --> 00:31:58,420
So I think that there's a world that can work for both, where if we do have to increase taxes, there can be a senior exemption.

430
00:31:58,701 --> 00:32:02,785
Just because we need to increase revenue in this city doesn't mean we need to box out a whole generation.

431
00:32:03,106 --> 00:32:07,811
But again, I think the best space for that is a ballot question, because something like that should go to the people.

432
00:32:08,111 --> 00:32:09,933
That should be weighted on by every individual.

433
00:32:11,515 --> 00:32:12,516
That'll be interesting.

434
00:32:12,556 --> 00:32:14,278
And that could be up next election.

435
00:32:14,358 --> 00:32:19,503
I mean, depending on how this election goes, it'll be really interesting to see what the next few years look like.

436
00:32:19,563 --> 00:32:19,944
Yeah.

437
00:32:20,464 --> 00:32:20,704
Great.

438
00:32:20,764 --> 00:32:21,545
Well, thank you so much.

439
00:32:21,605 --> 00:32:23,868
I'm going to switch to a little bit of a personal question.

440
00:32:23,888 --> 00:32:23,968
Sure.

441
00:32:24,008 --> 00:32:24,268
Yes.

442
00:32:24,408 --> 00:32:24,508
OK.

443
00:32:24,528 --> 00:32:25,970
These are meant to be fun.

444
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:26,270
OK.

445
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:30,614
So if you could share something about yourself that you think might surprise us.

446
00:32:31,355 --> 00:32:32,737
Oh, that's a great question.

447
00:32:33,577 --> 00:32:34,398
Something fun.

448
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:37,160
I did a lot of theater in high school.

449
00:32:37,561 --> 00:32:39,421
Really loved, loved, loved it.

450
00:32:40,121 --> 00:32:48,204
Miss Grant and Erin Keith are two incredible individuals who I believe still do all the shows at the middle school and the high school.

451
00:32:48,224 --> 00:32:52,645
And those days just are so impactful on you.

452
00:32:52,665 --> 00:32:55,126
You know, also, like, I was a bit of a different kid, right?

453
00:32:55,166 --> 00:33:01,548
Like, I didn't, I was, I mean, I was class president, but I didn't also fit in really anywhere at the same time.

454
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:04,700
I was just different.

455
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:07,182
I didn't know how to explain it.

456
00:33:07,202 --> 00:33:12,687
You know, sometimes you just feel different, like you don't really fit in in a certain pocket, and I always kind of felt that way.

457
00:33:12,727 --> 00:33:18,453
But theater, I had that space where you could just be so weird and there was no judgment.

458
00:33:18,893 --> 00:33:22,076
I think when you find that place at a young age, it builds confidence.

459
00:33:22,857 --> 00:33:26,838
that you like feel hopefully like securing yourself to do the stuff that you're doing now.

460
00:33:26,898 --> 00:33:27,118
Right.

461
00:33:27,458 --> 00:33:27,918
Exactly.

462
00:33:27,978 --> 00:33:28,158
Right.

463
00:33:28,518 --> 00:33:31,019
The confidence you you're getting at such a big thing.

464
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:33,439
It is that it is that confidence.

465
00:33:33,479 --> 00:33:34,800
Everyone's cool in their own way.

466
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:39,041
It's just finding your own niche or the space that expands upon your best self.

467
00:33:39,221 --> 00:33:39,541
Right.

468
00:33:39,921 --> 00:33:43,802
I think we're all still always experiencing that, especially after a pandemic.

469
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,840
I think we all had a reevaluation of like, who am I?

470
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:48,681
What do I care about?

471
00:33:48,701 --> 00:33:49,841
What am I passionate about?

472
00:33:51,421 --> 00:33:53,321
And what do I prioritize in life?

473
00:33:53,541 --> 00:33:54,061
Oh, for sure.

474
00:33:54,402 --> 00:33:54,622
Yeah.

475
00:33:54,722 --> 00:33:58,302
I talk a lot about how the pandemic kind of shrunk things for us.

476
00:33:58,702 --> 00:33:58,982
Yes.

477
00:33:59,342 --> 00:34:00,663
Like everything became small.

478
00:34:00,703 --> 00:34:02,803
And I think in a lot of ways that was good.

479
00:34:02,843 --> 00:34:04,523
I think especially for connection, right?

480
00:34:04,563 --> 00:34:06,024
Connecting to our smaller communities.

481
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:09,264
I got the opportunity to meet a lot more people in my neighborhood, right?

482
00:34:09,284 --> 00:34:09,824
Yeah.

483
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:13,845
I don't know that I would have had otherwise had I been not forced to stay home all the time.

484
00:34:14,105 --> 00:34:16,107
I know, but you're a great example, right?

485
00:34:16,147 --> 00:34:21,091
Like, you know your neighbors better and you're more involved in local government, right?

486
00:34:21,131 --> 00:34:22,672
Would you say that after the past few years?

487
00:34:22,712 --> 00:34:32,080
And I think again, some super small silver linings to the pandemic, but that was one of them is our community is really paying attention now in a wonderful way.

488
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:35,522
We should hold our local officials to the same standard.

489
00:34:35,883 --> 00:34:38,385
We hold a member of Congress or president of the United States.

490
00:34:39,825 --> 00:34:50,708
Because you should always be a good person, you should always respect others, and you should put the best interest forward for a healthy planet, a healthy community, accessibility and equity.

491
00:34:51,288 --> 00:34:58,390
And so I'm hoping those are all results of really the past few years of people getting tuned back into their neighborhood, their community.

492
00:34:59,419 --> 00:35:03,641
you know, really having like a mindset that how am I affecting my block?

493
00:35:03,861 --> 00:35:06,443
How am I shaping my neighborhood, my community?

494
00:35:06,463 --> 00:35:09,524
Because it really is, it's on all of us, right?

495
00:35:09,564 --> 00:35:12,286
It's not on like our seven counselors alone.

496
00:35:12,746 --> 00:35:16,788
It's on all of us as activists and community members to take that initiative up.

497
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:18,109
Yeah.

498
00:35:18,649 --> 00:35:22,891
Have you ever gotten any advice that, you know, really stuck with you that you'd want to pass on to other people?

499
00:35:23,372 --> 00:35:23,712
Yes.

500
00:35:24,572 --> 00:35:25,473
This is a good question.

501
00:35:26,678 --> 00:35:28,719
I have a few quotes in mind.

502
00:35:28,739 --> 00:35:38,442
I don't know that this is so much advice as a nugget of my father's life he shared with me that I just always carry with me.

503
00:35:38,522 --> 00:35:44,783
But my dad met my mom at a church in South Medford on a Wednesday.

504
00:35:44,983 --> 00:35:45,724
They were at mass.

505
00:35:46,404 --> 00:35:49,185
And the priest introduced my dad to my mom.

506
00:35:50,578 --> 00:35:55,080
and literally my dad proposed seven days later in that exact spot.

507
00:35:55,721 --> 00:35:58,682
He knew her for a week before he proposed and they're still married today.

508
00:35:59,943 --> 00:36:07,447
It's kind of unreal and they have four great children and some grandchildren as well and my parents are just

509
00:36:08,957 --> 00:36:11,420
do we bicker, of course, but they're everything to me.

510
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:19,087
And my dad said, he said this at the time when, you know, my grandparents, my dad came home and he said, I'm engaged.

511
00:36:19,127 --> 00:36:20,668
My grandparents were like, oh, yeah, sure.

512
00:36:20,969 --> 00:36:21,950
Like, they had never met my mom.

513
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:22,590
They're like, to who?

514
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:23,611
Who are you engaged to?

515
00:36:23,791 --> 00:36:24,952
He said, Nancy Cicchini.

516
00:36:24,992 --> 00:36:26,934
She lives, you know, she lives on the hillside.

517
00:36:26,954 --> 00:36:27,335
And they were like.

518
00:36:27,775 --> 00:36:28,615
You're making this up.

519
00:36:28,655 --> 00:36:34,497
My dad had to bring my mom over to be like, this is the woman I'm marrying, which I don't blame my grandparents.

520
00:36:34,537 --> 00:36:40,559
But my dad said to my grandparents, when you know and you know you know, confidence replaces fear.

521
00:36:42,039 --> 00:36:44,480
And that's always just been a powerful thing.

522
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:47,521
I've had moments in my life of so much self-doubt.

523
00:36:48,721 --> 00:36:52,082
I went to University of New Hampshire my first semester of undergrad.

524
00:36:53,025 --> 00:36:54,086
And I was so unhappy.

525
00:36:54,887 --> 00:36:57,810
And I actually transferred in the middle of the year to UMass Lowell.

526
00:36:58,451 --> 00:37:04,798
And I remember I was so scared, but simultaneously it was this pure feeling of confidence.

527
00:37:07,401 --> 00:37:09,744
And I carry that with me now.

528
00:37:10,104 --> 00:37:11,285
I was scared to do this.

529
00:37:11,365 --> 00:37:13,648
I was running for city council as a,

530
00:37:15,163 --> 00:37:16,464
It's an intimidating thing.

531
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:31,077
You're running to represent 58,000 lives and understand their concerns, hear their concerns, and balance their concerns so that you're trying to give everyone what they envision is what their happy life is.

532
00:37:31,198 --> 00:37:32,779
And that's no easy feat.

533
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:41,206
But I try to let, for me, the confidence overwhelm the fear of, I'm scared, but it feels like

534
00:37:41,867 --> 00:37:45,208
you're being called to this moment to take action in your community.

535
00:37:45,228 --> 00:37:47,388
And I hope everyone feels that way.

536
00:37:47,428 --> 00:37:49,149
Like running for office is scared.

537
00:37:49,169 --> 00:37:54,350
Whether you're listening to this in Medford or some other community, I hope you consider too.

538
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:57,451
I mean, Lori Trahan always said this to me, who is my former boss.

539
00:37:57,911 --> 00:38:00,071
She always said, lean in, lean in.

540
00:38:00,271 --> 00:38:02,992
It's scary, but lean into the fights, the hard fights.

541
00:38:03,852 --> 00:38:07,733
And I hope everyone in the city does that over the next two years.

542
00:38:07,773 --> 00:38:11,154
And I hope if I'm fortunate enough to be elected, people hold my feet to the fire.

543
00:38:12,094 --> 00:38:13,975
as we're sitting next to a fire.

544
00:38:14,736 --> 00:38:25,201
I hope that the people hold me and the other, if fortunate enough, other six counselors accountable, hold the mayor accountable, hold your state reps accountable, your state senators.

545
00:38:25,542 --> 00:38:27,763
You know, these people, they made promises to you.

546
00:38:28,143 --> 00:38:30,184
And they, you know, Rome wasn't built in a day.

547
00:38:30,204 --> 00:38:34,186
It's not going to happen overnight, but you should really see some,

548
00:38:35,687 --> 00:38:38,748
good transformation in Medford in the next few years.

549
00:38:39,588 --> 00:38:56,611
And hopefully that's transformation we all benefit from, whether it's a revitalized Medford Square, an infrastructure plan for our streets, dramatically better Medford High School, continuing, like look at our recreation program as a young department, what they've been able to do since 2015.

550
00:38:56,711 --> 00:39:05,013
We have to continue to provide resources to build out Medford Rec and get trees, trees on every street.

551
00:39:06,573 --> 00:39:15,736
And so I hope that that's the transformation we see in the next few years, that people start to really, you know, this community has so much pride.

552
00:39:16,656 --> 00:39:17,616
So much pride.

553
00:39:17,776 --> 00:39:18,756
It's blown me away.

554
00:39:18,796 --> 00:39:23,497
That's really like, we've knocked about 9,000 doors the past six months.

555
00:39:24,118 --> 00:39:25,218
Our team's definitely tired.

556
00:39:25,918 --> 00:39:29,981
But everyone's shared so many stories with us along the way, and we carry those stories.

557
00:39:30,061 --> 00:39:33,503
And a lot of them are what people love about Medford, what they see in Medford.

558
00:39:34,143 --> 00:39:38,826
And so we just need a city that really reflects what people already see in the city, you know?

559
00:39:40,548 --> 00:39:43,029
I'm so hopeful and confident we can do that.

560
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:45,471
And I just, I always say, you know,

561
00:39:47,241 --> 00:39:53,789
It matters so much what happens at City Hall, even though people don't watch it like they watch CNN or Fox News.

562
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:58,094
Your access to the ballot box is decided at City Hall, not the U.S.

563
00:39:58,154 --> 00:39:58,615
Capitol.

564
00:39:59,055 --> 00:40:01,839
The state of your street is decided at City Hall, not the U.S.

565
00:40:01,879 --> 00:40:02,279
Capitol.

566
00:40:03,941 --> 00:40:05,462
And so I hope people really feel that.

567
00:40:05,742 --> 00:40:06,483
I think they are.

568
00:40:07,444 --> 00:40:09,626
We keep saying we're cautiously optimistic.

569
00:40:11,247 --> 00:40:17,572
I can give my final ask to listeners, but I don't want to cut you off if it's not time.

570
00:40:17,592 --> 00:40:18,673
I think you're getting there.

571
00:40:18,793 --> 00:40:20,114
Awesome.

572
00:40:20,374 --> 00:40:24,177
My big ask is that people get out to vote.

573
00:40:24,437 --> 00:40:25,458
You get out to vote.

574
00:40:25,558 --> 00:40:27,640
I mean, I don't know when this will be posted right now.

575
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:30,022
We're eight days out from an election.

576
00:40:32,303 --> 00:40:37,888
this election is pivotal between the federal funds coming and just speaking to who are we as a community?

577
00:40:38,188 --> 00:40:39,469
What do we believe in?

578
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:48,357
Do we want people with energy, people that are really gonna do their personal best to take action and have Medford put our best foot forward these next two years?

579
00:40:49,638 --> 00:40:50,879
So I ask that you get out to vote.

580
00:40:51,259 --> 00:40:53,141
You take your friends and family with you.

581
00:40:53,261 --> 00:40:57,625
Everyone, you should say to yourself, I've got three people to vote this election.

582
00:40:59,774 --> 00:41:02,396
Early voting, it's today until 5 p.m.

583
00:41:02,416 --> 00:41:02,776
at City Hall.

584
00:41:02,796 --> 00:41:03,896
You said you're going to vote today, right?

585
00:41:03,916 --> 00:41:04,757
Yeah, my wife and I are going right now.

586
00:41:04,777 --> 00:41:05,618
That's amazing.

587
00:41:05,758 --> 00:41:06,458
It's amazing.

588
00:41:06,538 --> 00:41:10,060
And, you know, it's open City Hall hours this week through Thursday.

589
00:41:10,741 --> 00:41:13,542
If you're voting by mail, those should be in the mail today.

590
00:41:13,842 --> 00:41:16,544
They're really saying tomorrow would be the last day to put that in the mail.

591
00:41:16,984 --> 00:41:18,825
Otherwise, you should drop that at City Hall.

592
00:41:19,506 --> 00:41:22,287
And then, of course, vote November 2nd on Election Day.

593
00:41:22,668 --> 00:41:25,129
Polls are open, I believe it's 7 to 8.

594
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:28,011
Sorry, my brain's a little fried, but yeah, it's 7.

595
00:41:28,351 --> 00:41:33,274
seven to eight, and so get out and vote, bring your friends, bring your family, it matters.

596
00:41:33,354 --> 00:41:36,215
It matters so much who we pick right now.

597
00:41:36,335 --> 00:41:38,416
So I hope people are feeling that urgency.

598
00:41:38,517 --> 00:41:46,461
I know I am, but I've also been doing this for six months and it's been awesome, but I'm also so excited to see what happens here.

599
00:41:46,481 --> 00:41:53,865
I hope that our hard work pays off and that Medford sees our vision and agrees it's the best vision for Medford.

600
00:41:54,185 --> 00:42:00,187
I know I realized that I've started thinking about politics and elections in the same way I think about big sporting events.

601
00:42:00,207 --> 00:42:03,088
So I'm really excited to think about the outcome.

602
00:42:03,448 --> 00:42:05,149
So you mentioned that today is Monday.

603
00:42:05,349 --> 00:42:06,769
We're recording this on Monday the 25th.

604
00:42:07,009 --> 00:42:10,651
So people should get their ballots in the mail today if they're mailing in.

605
00:42:10,811 --> 00:42:12,091
But definitely by tomorrow.

606
00:42:12,111 --> 00:42:14,892
Tomorrow the latest, the 26th.

607
00:42:14,932 --> 00:42:15,753
Tomorrow the latest.

608
00:42:16,313 --> 00:42:20,214
Because they say it takes about five to seven days with USPS.

609
00:42:20,575 --> 00:42:24,896
If you're feeling any sense of uncertainty, there is a Dropbox on the side of City Hall.

610
00:42:25,057 --> 00:42:27,958
It's labeled very clearly, ballot Dropbox.

611
00:42:27,978 --> 00:42:28,798
You can put them there.

612
00:42:28,818 --> 00:42:30,739
It's very secure.

613
00:42:30,779 --> 00:42:33,500
I've asked City Hall a bunch of questions about how this works.

614
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:35,441
So I know it's a secure process.

615
00:42:36,201 --> 00:42:39,703
But we should all think of democracy just like

616
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:46,468
your personal health, right, in working out and eating healthy, you kind of have to do it every day.

617
00:42:47,349 --> 00:42:49,151
Otherwise, you're out of shape, right?

618
00:42:49,252 --> 00:42:51,034
And that's the same with democracy.

619
00:42:51,094 --> 00:42:56,902
We have to do this every day to keep our community in a really healthy place.

620
00:42:57,142 --> 00:43:07,924
And so I hope voters think of it that way, like a sporting event, or like working out that this is such a big deal, because it shapes what the next two years of your life, and longer, right?

621
00:43:07,984 --> 00:43:11,665
The decisions made over the next two years could impact generations.

622
00:43:12,845 --> 00:43:13,945
And they have, they have.

623
00:43:14,045 --> 00:43:22,387
I've been, I'm the product of many Medford policies in our public schools, and in general planning for the city, and our parks program, and so,

624
00:43:23,927 --> 00:43:28,210
I've gone on long enough, but I hope people feel that urgency.

625
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:31,112
Yeah, no, I think this will be a lot of really useful information for folks.

626
00:43:31,152 --> 00:43:31,593
Thank you.

627
00:43:31,613 --> 00:43:34,215
And I really appreciate you coming here today and taking the time.

628
00:43:34,475 --> 00:43:35,055
Of course.

629
00:43:35,435 --> 00:43:36,977
And Danielle, thank you so much again.

630
00:43:37,137 --> 00:43:39,759
I'm just blown away by how quickly this came together.

631
00:43:40,739 --> 00:43:45,263
If everything in the world could work like this, we'd be in a much more productive place.

632
00:43:45,543 --> 00:43:46,383
That'd be great.

633
00:43:46,544 --> 00:43:46,764
All right.

634
00:43:46,784 --> 00:43:47,484
Well, thank you so much.

635
00:43:47,504 --> 00:43:48,085
Thanks, Danielle.

636
00:43:48,485 --> 00:43:48,905
And good luck.

637
00:43:49,386 --> 00:43:49,766
