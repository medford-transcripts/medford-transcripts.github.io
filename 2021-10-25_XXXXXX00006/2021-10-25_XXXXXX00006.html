    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=4.458">The</a>  following interview is of City Council candidate David Tedisco. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=8.922">Information</a>  for this introduction was taken from David's campaign website, which is linked in the show notes for further reading. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=16.649">David</a>  has been working and volunteering in politics since his days as class president at Medford High School, a position he held for three years. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=25.036">At</a>  the age of 18, David interned for State Representative Sean Garibelli. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=29.62">He</a>  also worked on Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign in New Hampshire, learning the importance of engaging with the community to understand the issues people faced. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=39.788">At</a>  the age of 19, David was asked to be the campaign coordinator for former Medford Mayor Stephanie Eugenie Burke. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=48.163">His</a>  time working with this campaign gave him a deeper insight into Medford politics and the challenges that Medford residents face today. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=55.887">Recently,</a>  David was working in D.C. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=57.769">in</a>  the office of Congresswoman Lori Trahan as his Press Secretary and Digital Director. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=64.752">In</a>  his campaign for City Council, David is focused on implementing a citywide infrastructure plan, modernizing city services, and revitalizing Medford Square into a thriving downtown area replete with diverse local businesses. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=79.583">Interviews</a>  for this podcast are done in a way to ensure COVID safety. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=83.731">For</a>  that reason, you may notice the sound of rain in the background of this episode. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=88.579">Thanks</a>  for listening. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=94.949">Hi,</a>  David. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=95.43">Thanks</a>  so much for joining me today.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=97.332">Danielle,</a>  thank you for having me. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=98.874">This</a>  is amazing.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=100.015">Oh,</a>  no, no worries. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=100.856">I'm</a>  glad you could be here. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=102.598">So</a>  to start off, I've been asking folks that I interview about their favorite choice for a place to get a bite to eat in Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=108.404">So</a>  what is yours?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=110.146">Well,</a>  I don't think it's much of a secret about me, but I'm Tenoch's biggest fan. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=116.113">Been</a>  going there since they opened. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=118.235">I</a>  was in high school, it was either 2014, and I remember I was at Papagino's in the square. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=123.339">I</a>  had just eaten a full pizza and I looked across the street and saw a burrito place. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=128.423">Keep</a>  in mind I weighed like 260 pounds at the time, but I looked across the street and I was like, a burrito? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=133.647">And</a>  I did have a full burrito after having this pizza and fell in love that day and have been going to Tenoch. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=140.312">ever</a>  since, but I try not to have both a full pizza and burrito consistently now. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=144.474">Try</a>  to do one or the other.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=145.535">That's</a>  a good adult life choice.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=147.856">Yeah,</a>  trying to be healthier as an adult, not a high schooler, but yeah, just very Tenoch proud and always trying to send people there and order their food whenever I can.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=159.603">So</a>  is a burrito your go-to there?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=162.064">I</a>  actually, and I'm not going to pronounce this correctly, but plato mexicano, which is just like a burrito on a plate, pretty much. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=168.827">And</a>  it's rice, beans, and you can do chicken or steak. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=171.469">And</a>  their secret, a lot of people don't know about, is mole, which is their chocolate sauce that's spicy. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=178.332">It's</a>  not sweet, but it's really, really amazing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=180.753">And</a>  I think Tenoch is such a great example of, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=186.65">one</a>  of the really cool hidden gems in Medford and Medford Square, and just represents, right, the diversity we currently have in the local business scene and how do we continue to expand upon that and bring different cultures in, because we're all, you know, if you look down Medford Square on a Friday night, I think it's Nigea, the sushi, all-you-can-eat sushi place. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=207.844">There's</a>  like always a line out the door. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=209.425">It's</a>  unreal. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=211.266">So</a>  people really love these diverse options and, of course, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=214.908">day</a>  one. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=215.749">I</a>  grew up eating Bob's Subs in South Medford so I always have to do a shout out to Bob's as well.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=222.372">I</a>  love hearing other people's experiences of these places.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=225.234">Yeah</a>  I know and I'm trying to think like you know of course Medford Brewing is opening up on Harvard Ave. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=230.397">Yeah</a>  it is Harvard Ave. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=232.598">hopefully</a>  in the next six months like we're you know just adding to the scene and it's it's exciting stuff and exciting like the direction we're going in of just having more and more uh different options on the menu you know so</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=246.78">Cool.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=247.501">You</a>  talked about your involvement in Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=251.044">And</a>  we talked a little bit about it in the intro. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=252.925">And</a>  you've got a lot of experience interacting with local businesses. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=257.81">But</a>  I'm just interested in hearing about what led you to run for city council and your path to local politics.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=266.377">Yeah,</a>  my path to local politics. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=269.06">So</a>  I was a junior in high school and my brother Dennis was really successful. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=275.306">He</a>  started a clothing company at the time and like a larger brand called Karma Loop bought his brand and he was doing really great. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=284.235">And</a>  so I said to myself, I want to go into business because I want to make money because that's <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=288.319">That's</a>  cool. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=289.66">And</a>  then junior year history, I had a teacher named Jonathan Streff, who's still at the high school now. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=296.725">And</a>  I somehow, by the skin of my teeth, got into APUS. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=301.768">I</a>  think it was APUS history. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=304.19">And</a>  he just opened my eyes to the importance of civic engagement and being a part of something so much greater than yourself. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=314.415">And</a>  so it's when I kind of changed my focus to maybe I don't want to go to business school, maybe I want to get involved in public life. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=323.925">Even</a>  though, and it's so true, and I learned this lesson later on, jobs don't pay well in the public sector. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=330.712">So,</a>  you know, it's really an issue of equity and making the sector more attractive so we have people invest more in our society. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=340.265">But</a>  yeah, I mean, Jonathan Streff, he was the type of guy that, I mean, on the weekends, he was a national park ranger at JFK's birth home in Brookline and would do civil war reenactments on the weekend. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=353.155">Like</a>  this is a guy that currently lives and breathes the history, you know? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=358.018">So</a>  he really just spread that passion. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=360.34">And</a>  the funny thing is, if you look at my campaign today, right, my campaign, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=366.393">Our</a>  core team, it's a ton of people from my high school class and specifically a lot of students that had strep in particular and I think they kind of caught the bug the same way I did of this is so cool and exciting and you're part of something so much greater than just you. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=383.643">So</a>  that was when I kind of mentally got first invested in politics. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=389.518">Then</a>  I went, you know, after Medford High, I went to UMass Lowell, and I remember I was at the club fair, and there was like a huge Donald Trump table. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=398.581">And</a>  this was at UMass Lowell, which I perceived to be like a more, you know, democratic university. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=404.243">And</a>  of course, there's strength and diversity of opinions, but I was just disheartened that I didn't see like a college Democrats table. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=410.586">So</a>  I went over to the Trump table, and I said, where's the college Democrats? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=414.407">And</a>  they, you know, they just smiled and said, they don't exist. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=417.728">And</a>  I couldn't believe it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=418.909">So</a>  I started College Democrats at UMass Lowell. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=422.291">I</a>  mean, it's still going today, a really strong organization. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=425.052">But</a>  it was exciting because at the time, a congressional primary was going on. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=431.436">Nikki</a>  Songhus, who represented the Merrimack Valley, was stepping down. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=437.039">And</a>  so I met basically all the candidates because they wanted to come in and talk to our club. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=441.462">They</a>  wanted to get young people involved. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=444.283">in</a>  civic life and really get college Democrats on board their campaigns. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=448.027">So</a>  I met Rufus Gifford, Dan Coe, Lori Trahan. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=453.702">I</a>  ended up joining Rufus Gifford's campaign. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=456.584">And</a>  Rufus was the fundraiser for President Obama. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=461.668">He</a>  was later appointed ambassador to Denmark. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=464.49">He</a>  was so deep in public life and really saw the importance of being involved and playing your role in whatever capacity that may be. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=474.768">Rufus</a>  came in fifth place. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=477.649">That</a>  race didn't work out, but Rufus inspired me so much. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=482.15">So</a>  many things about Rufus. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=482.971">You</a>  know, he was an openly gay candidate running for Congress. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=486.352">I</a>  was very much and always am in the process of coming out, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=489.613">Because</a>  everyone you meet, you're always coming out to. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=491.813">It's</a>  like introducing any other element of your personality. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=495.834">But</a>  he just really inspired me. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=497.075">He</a>  was so proud and secure of who he was and had such a vision and passion for what America should be. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=505.399">And</a>  so I joined Rufus. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=506.479">It</a>  didn't work out. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=507.84">I</a>  ended up getting a scholarship to American University and going to grad school in Washington, DC. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=513.941">And</a>  I'm sitting there. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=515.641">I</a>  got a job in admissions. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=517.662">And</a>  I'm thinking, I know so much about this congressional district in Massachusetts, 37 cities and towns. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=525.364">And</a>  this knowledge is just being wasted. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=527.844">And</a>  so I called up Lori Trahan, who had won. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=530.265">And</a>  I knew of her. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=531.645">And</a>  she knew of me. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=532.165">And</a>  I was still very supportive of her. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=535.766">And</a>  after enough pestering, she said, all right, I'll take you on board. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=539.928">So</a>  I ended up joining her office, I think, February. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=542.949">She</a>  got it sworn in in January. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=544.329">I</a>  joined her team in February. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=546.51">Started</a>  off as her digital assistant, and then became her digital director and press secretary. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=552.872">And</a>  so that kind of takes me up to the point when I started to think about running for city council because what happened in my life happened in everyone else's life. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=562.121">The</a>  COVID-19 pandemic hit and kind of rocked everyone's world. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=567.918">And</a>  so I started watching city council meetings over Zoom because at the federal level, we were working on these large spending bills, the CARES package, the American Rescue Plan, the Families First Act, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=580.742">All</a>  these big, big spending bills filled with COVID-19 relief. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=584.243">And</a>  there was a lot in them. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=585.523">There</a>  was small business relief. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=587.184">There</a>  was testing resources, vaccine funding. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=591.965">simple</a>  things like PPE, right, the personal protective equipment. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=595.59">And</a>  so I was watching city council to see how are we talking about these big spending bills at the local level. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=602.7">You</a>  know, I know how we're talking about them at the U.S. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=604.902">Capitol,</a>  what's going on at home. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=608.877">I</a>  tuned in, and I think I experienced what a lot of residents experience, which was really shocked by the state of the council. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=617.56">It</a>  was really divided. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=618.521">The</a>  discourse got really low at times, and I know it was a tough two years. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=623.243">But</a>  I've elected you to represent me and 58,000 other people. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=629.265">And</a>  I just always hope we keep the bar high and always maintain respect even when we disagree. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=635.489">We</a>  can disagree on opinion, but acknowledge we're still neighbors, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=641.193">And</a>  the important thing is that we need to educate each other. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=644.175">We</a>  need to educate each other about our stances so that you understand why I believe black lives matter and why I believe love is love, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=651.599">These</a>  are important things. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=652.62">It's</a>  not just a lawn sign. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=654.441">These</a>  affect people's lives and well-being. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=659.029">And</a>  so I just, you know, it was also the peak of the Black Lives Matter movement, and I was working in lockstep with Mobilize Medford, and we organized a letter which went out. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=669.479">Over</a>  700 residents signed on to this letter, which basically said, hey, city administrators, thanks so much for declaring racism a public health crisis. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=678.388">It</a>  really was an important thing, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=679.629">It</a>  unlocked <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=681.37">special</a>  funding from the state that we wouldn't receive had we not declared that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=685.894">But</a>  many also saw it as a Band-Aid solution. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=688.476">What</a>  did that really do beyond that wonderful claim? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=692.299">What</a>  are we doing to make systemic change? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=695.662">And</a>  so this letter we wrote outlined six different priorities of here are things you can do in the city of Medford to actually make Medford more equitable. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=703.648">And</a>  I think that's where it gets into many other policy areas, which I'm happy to dive into. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=710.242">And</a>  so the response to that was really nothing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=714.506">Some</a>  folks emailed back, but there was no follow-up. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=717.589">There</a>  was no actionable change. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=720.312">And</a>  so I took a step back, and you look at the bigger picture. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=723.114">And</a>  you say, all right, we're not really delivering. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=726.317">for</a>  every population in Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=728.138">We're</a>  not really delivering on the basic services. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=730.54">I</a>  mean, I looked at, right, I live in North Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=732.641">You</a>  look at the state of the streets and the sidewalks. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=735.483">And</a>  that's what I got my master's in was public administration. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=738.224">And</a>  my degree was really focused on municipal planning and infrastructure and finance and the intersectionality of all these issues. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=747.768">And</a>  so I just, I said to myself, we're really not delivering so many of the basic things that our neighbors are. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=755.432">Malden</a>  is, Somerville is, Cambridge is, Melrose is, on a lot of these issues. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=760.815">And</a>  so I said to myself, all right, we need new blood in Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=764.717">I'll</a>  be honest, I've always been more of a behind the scenes guy, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=768.179">I</a>  worked for Mayor Burke, managed her campaign in 2017. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=773.161">I</a>  worked on the Biden campaign from home, making calls all day, worked on Secretary Clinton's campaign. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=779.224">Like,</a>  you know, I've always been behind the scenes working on these elements. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=782.665">Never</a>  pictured myself as a candidate until I was talking to a lot of my friends and family this spring about, you know, who are we gonna run? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=790.368">Asking</a>  around, I'll happily manage a campaign. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=794.211">And</a>  a few folks were like, well, why don't you just run? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=796.915">Why</a>  don't you run? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=797.496">And</a>  I said, well, you know, I don't know if that's right for me right now. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=801.782">I</a>  had already moved home because the pandemic got so bad that I decided to move home. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=809.392">mid-2020</a>  because I was paying rent in DC, but because I could be home, I was home. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=816.537">I</a>  said, why am I paying rent in DC when I really want to be back in Medford? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=819.939">The</a>  idea was to move there, get the degree, and come back home, and that just really happened to work out. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=826.69">That's,</a>  you know, the pandemic had very few silver linings, but I view them as, that is one of them of, it really prompted this internal look on yourself. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=836.332">What</a>  do you prioritize? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=837.213">What</a>  do you want in life? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=838.433">And</a>  I realized, like, I'm not spending enough time with my family, especially in a public health crisis. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=842.654">You</a>  realize not everyone's here for as long as you'd like them to be. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=845.975">So</a>  you've got to spend time with those that mean the world to you. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=850.756">So</a>  I know I went a little bit all over the map here. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=852.597">Sorry.</a> </p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=852.877">EMILY</a>  FORTUNA No, you touched on a lot of the different things that I was going to ask you. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=858.78">Sort</a>  of like what your observations have been, what you'd like to change, or what you'd like to see done differently. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=864.262">And</a>  I also would agree. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=868.764">Lots</a>  of people have become more engaged in local politics and watching the city council. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=872.647">The</a>  access with Zoom, for me at least, made things really easy to participate.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=877.991">And</a>  we need to keep that, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=879.412">That</a>  is dropping the barriers to civic engagement. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=883.415">How</a>  are we allowing a city like Medford, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=886.558">We're</a>  not Boston. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=887.719">We</a>  don't have the press that Boston has or even Cambridge or Somerville. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=892.062">We're</a>  lucky to have the transcript, and Kinga, who's a new reporter here in Medford, we're lucky to have her in the organization. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=899.467">But</a>  we always need more coverage. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=901.929">And</a>  the most important thing we can do is expose people directly to government. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=906.772">See</a>  what the people you've elected are like. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=909.353">How</a>  do they talk? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=910.174">What</a>  do they care about? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=911.475">Are</a>  they reflecting your priorities? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=915.117">And</a>  I think over the last two years, a lot of us had that internal look, you know, looking in the mirror as a city. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=923.087">What</a>  do we want to prioritize over the next two years? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=928.337">And</a>  so yeah, that is why Zoom is so important and in any barrier for anyone to get engaged in the conversation is critical. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=935.824">And</a>  there's so many ways that we can open up the conversation to make city government more accessible to all different populations that historically have been shut out of the conversation. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=946.414">But</a>  I just want to touch upon why this moment matters. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=951.178">We</a>  have $48 million coming to the city of Medford from the American Rescue Plan. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=956.743">And</a>  I know some folks are starting to talk about this. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=959.485">I've</a>  been mentioning this since May on the campaign trail because I worked on the messaging of the legislation back when I was working for the Congresswoman. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=968.973">So</a>  I was very mindful of this huge influx of federal funds coming to Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=975.739">We're</a>  adding about a whole fourth to our regular municipal budget. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=979.04">I</a>  mean, it's really a remarkable opportunity to get through some serious backlog on projects, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=985.144">Of</a>  course, first and foremost, we should be prioritizing the public health crisis. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=988.846">That's</a>  what these dollars were dedicated for. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=991.307">So,</a>  Medford High School. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=993.441">I</a>  graduated Medford High in 2015. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=996.005">I</a>  was class president. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=997.547">Couldn't</a>  have been more proud of the people in that building and the educators and the administrators and the student body. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1003.736">The</a>  physical building is lacking dramatically. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1007.04">I'm</a>  not the only one to notice this, of course. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1009.81">but</a>  we still don't have proper ventilation at the high school. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1013.693">You</a>  know, we can claim we do because we've unlocked some metal windows that were locked up in the 80s or 90s, but that doesn't mean we have proper ventilation. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1022.881">You</a>  know, the other element is, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1026.499">There</a>  is that conversation about do we get a new high school. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1029.58">You</a>  know, we've invested so much in B building and the new pool and the new field of dreams. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1035.703">But</a>  the important thing is we've got to start that conversation. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1038.084">This</a>  project is going to take seven years no matter what. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1041.346">And</a>  how can these federal funds assist with that? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1044.127">So</a>  I think first and foremost, right, if a new high school is going to take seven years, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1048.409">we</a>  should be updating the ventilation immediately, immediately with these federal funds. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1052.091">That's</a>  what they were dedicated for. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1053.831">And</a>  I'm talking about air controlled rooms. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1055.492">You</a>  know, it is against state law for a public facility to be above 80 degrees Fahrenheit. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1060.574">Yet</a>  it happens at Medford High every September, May, and June. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1063.996">And</a>  that's because it was grandfathered in. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1065.917">It</a>  was built before the state law was put in place. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1068.438">But</a>  the reality is, is the state law was put in place for a reason. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1071.819">It's</a>  unsafe for students with disability. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1075.101">And</a>  unsafe, you know, in general, if you can't focus because you're so uncomfortable in a hot room, how are you paying attention to your education? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1085.008">And</a>  this is where we fall behind compared to our neighbors. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1088.15">You</a>  know, if you think about it, a student sweating in a classroom in Medford, probably not going to get as good grades as a student who's very comfortable in Winchester, just able to easily pay attention to the curriculum. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1098.297">That</a>  is where the gap begins to grow when we don't invest. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1103.247">And</a>  so that's why these federal funds are a really exciting opportunity, getting proper ventilation at the high school, starting an infrastructure plan across the city of Medford to update our streets and our sidewalks, not only so that they're well paved, but that they're ADA compliant, and being mindful of climate resiliency every step of the way. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1123.514">I'm</a>  not going to claim I'm the climate expert. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1126.7">I</a>  think that's a problem right now with any leader in this country who's elected. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1131.665">You</a>  don't have to be the expert. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1133.286">You</a>  didn't get a PhD in environmental policy. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1136.63">But</a>  your job is to get those people in the room. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1139.252">Have</a>  them advise you on what is best. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1141.735">The</a>  public health crisis showed that best, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1144.477">You</a>  don't have to be the doctor. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1147.34">but</a>  get the doctor in the room to tell you the best thing, not Facebook, but a real medical professional to tell you, you know, should you be wearing a mask? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1157.184">Should</a>  you get vaccinated? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1158.345">Let</a>  them do the research. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1159.585">That's</a>  their job. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1160.846">And</a>  you do your job. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1161.726">Maybe</a>  your job's an educator. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1163.087">Maybe</a>  your job's a coach. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1164.227">Maybe</a>  your job is working at a grocery store or helping pave a road. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1168.409">I</a>  mean, we all play such a critical role in society and let the experts do what they've studied, you know?</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1177.373">Yeah,</a>  no, and it sounds like you have a lot of things that you would like to change or like to continue seeing work done on in the city. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1186.022">Do</a>  you have any thoughts about equity? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1187.784">You've</a>  addressed this in a little bit of your response already, but what Medford would need to become more equitable?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1194.651">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1195.111">And</a>  I know a few other candidates have touched upon this in the pod series as well, which real quick, just before I jump into equity, I just want to say like, Danielle, the fact that you wrote about this podcast on Facebook a week and a half ago, and it is up and running now, and you have four episodes. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1212.056">It's</a>  just remarkable. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1212.937">And</a>  I think that's so symbolic of Medford residents. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1216.018">Like</a>  we have an idea and we want to put it to action. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1218.798">We</a>  just need a government that matches that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1221.84">But</a>  I've just been so blown away by how you got this up and running, and a brand, and a logo, and it's on Spotify. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1229.769">I'm</a>  very, very impressed. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1231.171">So</a>  thank you for doing that and moving so fast. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1235.096">Back</a>  to equity.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1236.738">Also</a>  to say, I couldn't have done it without the accessibility of the candidates that have come on. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1241.723">They've</a>  made it sort of easy to schedule things.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1244.587">That</a>  is awesome, right. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1246.089">And</a>  that's where a responsive government comes into the conversation, especially folks who are running to be your elected officials. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1255.658">Charter</a>  review, and if you've listened to other episodes, I apologize for repeating what charter review is, but charter review is basically our local constitution. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1264.081">It</a>  is how do we decide what our government looks like? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1267.022">We</a>  haven't done this in Medford in 38 years. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1269.963">Most</a>  communities build in an internal review every five to 10 years. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1274.064">It's</a>  just a given. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1275.725">And</a>  I think that's intentional for many reasons that we haven't had that review. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1283.08">What</a>  we desperately need in Medford is ward representation and at-large representation. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1288.764">Right</a>  now, I believe, Medford, we have eight wards in Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1292.247">Two</a>  of our eight wards are represented on the council. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1295.09">Eight</a>  of our eight wards should be represented on the council. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1298.332">And</a>  so it's a system Malden has. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1300.993">It's</a>  worked incredibly well for them. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1304.173">Somerville</a>  has it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1304.933">Cambridge</a>  has it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1307.374">It</a>  allows each neighborhood to be more engaged, to have someone more responsive to their issues, and actually have a city council that looks like the city of Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1315.936">And</a>  so I think that that's a domino effect for equity across the city, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1322.317">I</a>  got asked this question, what can we do to welcome more minority businesses to the city of Medford, minority-owned businesses? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1329.739">There's</a>  a number of things. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1330.78">We</a>  could have the chamber reach out more. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1332.36">We</a>  could ensure our city communications are multilingual, consistently, not just here or there, but across the board. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1342.284">make</a>  government services and communications much more accessible through a 3-1-1 system and easily access City Hall 24-7. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1350.115">But</a>  really, I would imagine if you're opening up, let's say, a pizza shop in Medford, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1357.385">you're</a>  going to look at what do the local elected officials look like? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1361.188">What</a>  does the scene look like? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1362.709">And</a>  then you might decide from there, is this the community that's right for my business? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1366.472">If</a>  we have a city council that actually looks like the population of Medford, I'm sure minority-owned businesses would feel more comfortable opening up shop here. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1373.798">We</a>  only have one black-owned business in Medford, Neighborhood Kitchen, which is great. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1378.701">But</a>  how do we open that up? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1381.203">You</a>  know, in talking about, we have so much opportunity coming, Mystic Avenue, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1387.317">I</a>  know that we've had a lot of folks kind of stop the progress that should have happened already on Mystic Avenue when you start talking about our housing shortage. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1394.959">And</a>  we have a housing crisis in Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1397.539">My</a>  generation is boxed out. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1399.08">We're</a>  boxed out. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1400.1">I</a>  graduated Medford High in 2015. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1402.561">Most</a>  of my friends have moved to a big city because they're like, well, I could stay here until I'm 40 and save up with my parents and then buy a house. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1412.883">Or</a>  I could go start my life in another city and start renting. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1417.428">The</a>  funny thing is, right, if you look at a lot of spaces to rent in Medford, it's outrageous. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1423.734">Locust</a>  Street apartments are about $3,000 for a studio. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1427.278">I</a>  looked there. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1427.838">I</a>  was like, OK, this is not realistic. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1430.561">I</a>  was renting in DC. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1431.662">My</a>  studio was $1,500 a month. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1433.524">That</a>  was already way too much money, $1,500 a month. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1436.467">We're</a>  talking studios and one bedrooms at $3,000 in Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1442.172">And</a>  so how do we curb that issue, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1444.374">And</a>  this is all in line with equity. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1445.855">This</a>  all falls under the question. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1449.317">We</a>  don't have an Office of Affordable Housing in Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1452.379">We</a>  don't have a land trust. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1455.301">There</a>  are a lot of actions we can take to really move forward in that space. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1460.945">And</a>  to me, Mystic Avenue is that golden opportunity of revising our zoning laws, looking at how do we make this space work for affordable housing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1469.773">I</a>  mean, not to mention Medford is currently, I think it's either 7 or 8% out of affordable housing citywide right now. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1475.479">By</a>  state law, we're supposed to be at 10%. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1478.101">So</a>  once again, we're breaking state law. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1481.625">That's</a>  where you allow those 40 Bs, which are apartment buildings that are 20% affordable housing, to open up here in Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1488.532">We've</a>  had multiple proposals and yet we pumped the brakes on them. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1492.656">I</a>  think Medford's at the point where we've been pumping the brakes for so long. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1496.9">Medford</a>  in so many ways, when you look at the physical elements, not the cultural, not the people, but the physical elements, it feels like we're in 1960. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1505.148">When</a>  you look at the layout of Medford Square, when you look at our housing stock, when you look at Mystic Ave, these are incredible opportunities. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1513.912">And</a>  you look at Malden downtown, they flipped in the past five years. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1517.553">They</a>  are accessible, they are walkable, they have public transportation. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1521.495">That's</a>  what we need to be fighting for in Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1523.936">And</a>  we need champions at the local level that are advocating for this. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1528.101">Medford</a>  Square, I'm nearly 25, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1531.364">Medford</a>  Square has been a conversation my whole life. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1533.707">We're</a>  gonna get to work on Medford Square. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1535.849">And</a>  I had, I won't lie, I had points of sincere hope when there were, there's been three different redraws of Medford Square. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1544.477">We</a>  don't need another study. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1545.978">We</a>  don't need another redraw of Medford Square. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1548.08">Nothing's</a>  changed since then. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1549.982">We</a>  need a <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1550.943">put</a>  that plan in action and put the shovel in the ground and get to work. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1554.385">I</a>  think the reason we kick that can down the road is because construction is going to be uncomfortable and people are going to be upset. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1560.65">The</a>  construction is worth it on the flip side, but I think that's why we continue to push it because <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1565.813">truly</a>  redrawing Medford Square is going to be uncomfortable for residents, for small businesses. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1570.455">There's</a>  going to have to be temporary solutions. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1573.136">But</a>  now it's been 25 years of avoiding the conversation. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1576.718">You're</a>  letting me talk for too long. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1578.999">I</a>  got a question about the charter.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1580.44">So</a>  if that were to happen, would it, it would be an option to go to at-large representation where you'd have to vote on that?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1587.603">I'm</a>  so glad you asked about this because I made a mental note that this process, there's a lot of misinformation about this process on the public front. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1598.389">I</a>  think that's no one's fault. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1599.89">No</a>  one really explains it to us. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1601.711">But</a>  the way it works is the council votes for the review. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1605.953">That</a>  then goes to the statehouse and is voted on at the statehouse. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1609.858">What</a>  the statehouse is voting on is just to start a commission to evaluate our charter. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1615.845">The</a>  commission then comes up with a proposed charter, which is then voted on by the community. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1622.713">It's</a>  a long process to even get to that point, which is why so many candidates are talking about this with urgency. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1629.437">We</a>  understand if we even get to work immediately, we have a two-year road ahead of us before we even have something tangible in front of us. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1637.323">But</a>  that commission will make a recommendation about the charter. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1641.385">So</a>  it can include things like ward representation and at large. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1645.588">It</a>  can include, you know, term limits, which I'm very incredibly in favor of. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1652.192">But</a>  of course, you know, just because I'm in favor of it doesn't mean it needs to happen. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1656.254">Like</a>  I understand that if I'm fortunate enough to be elected that I'd be representing 58,000 people and always want to listen to folks from all walks of life and every opinion and then evaluate from there what makes the most sense for a city like Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1670.859">You</a>  know, it reviews the power balance between the mayor and the council. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1675.221">We</a>  have a really, really strong mayor in Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1678.742">Like,</a>  you know, Malden also has a strong mayor, but they don't yield as much power as the mayor does in Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1685.368">And</a>  it's a lot on the mayor. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1686.869">It's</a>  a lot, because they basically, every decision falls under them. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1689.851">That's</a>  a large decision. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1690.832">You</a>  know, our council passes the budget, and they can do a lot of resolutions. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1695.235">But</a>  a lot of big initiatives, it's on the shoulders of the mayor to do that in two years. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1699.639">You</a>  have two years. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1701.26">to</a>  prove yourself, and really you have 12 months to prove yourself before you're in re-election again. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1706.622">That's</a>  a lot to ask. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1707.622">Working</a>  for Stephanie, I saw that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1710.203">I</a>  was blown away by what Stephanie could do in four years between, you know, funding the incredible project that was the police station, that was a lot of money, getting a brand new library, Riverside Park. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1721.327">Those</a>  are just a few things that I was like, wow, that's what a really strong administrator can do in a few years. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1727.369">But</a>  she was always fighting off her real act, you know, and that's tough. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1729.971">So</a>  I think charter review just to get to a healthier place would be a four-year mayor. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1734.974">To</a>  have anyone who's mayor just be more productive in that office, you know.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1739.756">Yeah,</a>  and you've shared a lot about the community of Medford, and it's clear that you have a lot that you appreciate about it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1745.819">Sorry</a>  if I'm going on. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1747.74">No,</a>  you're good. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1749.441">It's</a>  very informative. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1750.421">I</a>  think that's part of what I'm enjoying about this process is getting a deeper understanding of some of these issues. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1755.963">We</a>  just hear the terms, and they're not clear what they mean.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1758.303">TODD</a>  KERPELMAN So many people have explained charter review to you at this point. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1761.584">I</a>  feel bad. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1762.884">And</a>  I know it's more to get the word out there. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1765.025">But</a>  thanks for bearing with all the candidates while we explain this. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1769.226">It</a>  took me months as a candidate to understand this process. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1774.627">Being</a>  a candidate has been so informative. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1777.528">I</a>  mean, I can't tell you how much I know about trees now. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1781.49">I</a>  knew the importance of trees, but I don't think I understood in depth. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1786.152">Like,</a>  some trees have a life of 90 years, you know, the same as a human. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1791.615">I</a>  just, I never thought of it that way. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1793.175">Growing</a>  up, I was like, trees live for hundreds of years. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1795.897">And</a>  that is true about some trees, but not all species. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1799.858">In</a>  trees, right, talking about equity, trees are an issue of equity. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1803.8">South</a>  Medford, South Medford, some streets have one tree on the entire street. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1810.143">That</a>  is not true in Western North Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1812.024">And</a>  even in Western North Medford, there are still hundreds of tree stumps without, there should be a living tree where those tree stumps are. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1821.368">And</a>  so I'm incredibly in favor of expanding our forestry budget to really dramatically beef up our tree canopy in Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1830.353">And</a>  it all comes down to funding, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1832.034">A</a>  lot of people are like, how can we do it? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1833.115">It</a>  all comes down to funding. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1834.356">So</a>  again, that 48 million will help, but revising Mystic Avenue to increase tax revenue is going to help. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1841.36">And</a>  then if the community wants to look at it, you know, a lot of people talk about a two and a half override. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1846.543">And</a>  it's a really contentious issue in this community because people feel strongly on both sides. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1850.645">I</a>  do hear a lot of people say, I'll admit that, a lot of people say, I'll pay the taxes if you're going to give me the service. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1857.128">People</a>  don't want to pay the tax if they're kind of getting what they're getting right now, which I understand that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1861.149">They're</a>  not getting much. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1862.67">And</a>  that's not a bash on anyone. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1864.671">This</a>  is like generations long issue of us kind of dialing services back in the city of Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1872.914">But,</a>  you know, if the community is in favor of two and a half overhead, that should be a valid question. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1876.856">That</a>  should go up to the community. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1878.676">That</a>  shouldn't be decided by any elected official because, you know, I am one person and I have my life, my income, my scenario, my housing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1887.68">I</a>  don't have the same scenario as 58,000 other people. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1890.861">We</a>  have to be mindful of everyone's situation. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1894.022">For</a>  example, as I was door-knocking North Medford, I talked to a lot of seniors that said, David, I'm excited. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1901.427">I</a>  just want you to know if you increase taxes, I'll probably lose my home. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1907.05">I'm</a>  widowed. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1907.731">I</a>  live on Social Security. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1910.012">I'll</a>  lose this house. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1911.973">So</a>  I think that there's a world that can work for both, where if we do have to increase taxes, there can be a senior exemption. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1918.701">Just</a>  because we need to increase revenue in this city doesn't mean we need to box out a whole generation. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1923.106">But</a>  again, I think the best space for that is a ballot question, because something like that should go to the people. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1928.111">That</a>  should be weighted on by every individual. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1931.515">That'll</a>  be interesting. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1932.556">And</a>  that could be up next election. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1934.358">I</a>  mean, depending on how this election goes, it'll be really interesting to see what the next few years look like.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1939.563">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1940.464">Great.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1940.764">Well,</a>  thank you so much. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1941.605">I'm</a>  going to switch to a little bit of a personal question. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1943.888">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1944.008">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1944.408">OK.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1944.528">These</a>  are meant to be fun.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1946.13">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1946.41">So</a>  if you could share something about yourself that you think might surprise us.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1951.355">Oh,</a>  that's a great question. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1953.577">Something</a>  fun. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1955.66">I</a>  did a lot of theater in high school. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1957.561">Really</a>  loved, loved, loved it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1960.121">Miss</a>  Grant and Erin Keith are two incredible individuals who I believe still do all the shows at the middle school and the high school. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1968.224">And</a>  those days just are so impactful on you. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1972.665">You</a>  know, also, like, I was a bit of a different kid, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1975.166">Like,</a>  I didn't, I was, I mean, I was class president, but I didn't also fit in really anywhere at the same time. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1983.919">I</a>  was just different. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1984.76">I</a>  didn't know how to explain it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1987.202">You</a>  know, sometimes you just feel different, like you don't really fit in in a certain pocket, and I always kind of felt that way. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1992.727">But</a>  theater, I had that space where you could just be so weird and there was no judgment.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=1998.893">I</a>  think when you find that place at a young age, it builds confidence. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2002.857">that</a>  you like feel hopefully like securing yourself to do the stuff that you're doing now.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2006.898">Right.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2007.458">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2007.978">Right.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2008.518">The</a>  confidence you you're getting at such a big thing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2011.039">It</a>  is that it is that confidence. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2013.479">Everyone's</a>  cool in their own way. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2014.82">It's</a>  just finding your own niche or the space that expands upon your best self. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2019.221">Right.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2019.921">I</a>  think we're all still always experiencing that, especially after a pandemic. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2025.56">I</a>  think we all had a reevaluation of like, who am I? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2027.92">What</a>  do I care about? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2028.701">What</a>  am I passionate about? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2031.421">And</a>  what do I prioritize in life? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2033.541">Oh,</a>  for sure.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2034.402">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2034.722">I</a>  talk a lot about how the pandemic kind of shrunk things for us.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2038.702">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2039.342">Like</a>  everything became small. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2040.703">And</a>  I think in a lot of ways that was good. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2042.843">I</a>  think especially for connection, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2044.563">Connecting</a>  to our smaller communities. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2046.544">I</a>  got the opportunity to meet a lot more people in my neighborhood, right?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2049.284">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2049.964">I</a>  don't know that I would have had otherwise had I been not forced to stay home all the time.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2054.105">I</a>  know, but you're a great example, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2056.147">Like,</a>  you know your neighbors better and you're more involved in local government, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2061.131">Would</a>  you say that after the past few years? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2062.712">And</a>  I think again, some super small silver linings to the pandemic, but that was one of them is our community is really paying attention now in a wonderful way. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2072.64">We</a>  should hold our local officials to the same standard. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2075.883">We</a>  hold a member of Congress or president of the United States. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2079.825">Because</a>  you should always be a good person, you should always respect others, and you should put the best interest forward for a healthy planet, a healthy community, accessibility and equity. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2091.288">And</a>  so I'm hoping those are all results of really the past few years of people getting tuned back into their neighborhood, their community. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2099.419">you</a>  know, really having like a mindset that how am I affecting my block? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2103.861">How</a>  am I shaping my neighborhood, my community? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2106.463">Because</a>  it really is, it's on all of us, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2109.564">It's</a>  not on like our seven Councilors alone. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2112.746">It's</a>  on all of us as activists and community members to take that initiative up.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2117.849">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2118.649">Have</a>  you ever gotten any advice that, you know, really stuck with you that you'd want to pass on to other people?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2123.372">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2124.572">This</a>  is a good question. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2126.678">I</a>  have a few quotes in mind. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2128.739">I</a>  don't know that this is so much advice as a nugget of my father's life he shared with me that I just always carry with me. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2138.522">But</a>  my dad met my mom at a church in South Medford on a Wednesday. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2144.983">They</a>  were at mass. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2146.404">And</a>  the priest introduced my dad to my mom. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2150.578">and</a>  literally my dad proposed seven days later in that exact spot. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2155.721">He</a>  knew her for a week before he proposed and they're still married today. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2159.943">It's</a>  kind of unreal and they have four great children and some grandchildren as well and my parents are just <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2168.957">do</a>  we bicker, of course, but they're everything to me. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2171.64">And</a>  my dad said, he said this at the time when, you know, my grandparents, my dad came home and he said, I'm engaged. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2179.127">My</a>  grandparents were like, oh, yeah, sure. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2180.969">Like,</a>  they had never met my mom. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2181.97">They're</a>  like, to who? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2182.69">Who</a>  are you engaged to? <a

know, she lives on the hillside. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2186.954">And</a>  they were like. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2187.775">You're</a>  making this up. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2188.655">My</a>  dad had to bring my mom over to be like, this is the woman I'm marrying, which I don't blame my grandparents. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2194.537">But</a>  my dad said to my grandparents, when you know and you know you know, confidence replaces fear. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2202.039">And</a>  that's always just been a powerful thing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2204.52">I've</a>  had moments in my life of so much self-doubt. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2208.721">I</a>  went to University of New Hampshire my first semester of undergrad. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2213.025">And</a>  I was so unhappy. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2214.887">And</a>  I actually transferred in the middle of the year to UMass Lowell. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2218.451">And</a>  I remember I was so scared, but simultaneously it was this pure feeling of confidence. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2227.401">And</a>  I carry that with me now. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2230.104">I</a>  was scared to do this. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2231.365">I</a>  was running for city council as a, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2235.163">It's</a>  an intimidating thing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2236.484">You're</a>  running to represent 58,000 lives and understand their concerns, hear their concerns, and balance their concerns so that you're trying to give everyone what they envision is what their happy life is. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2251.198">And</a>  that's no easy feat. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2254.24">But</a>  I try to let, for me, the confidence overwhelm the fear of, I'm scared, but it feels like <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2261.867">you're</a>  being called to this moment to take action in your community. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2265.228">And</a>  I hope everyone feels that way. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2267.428">Like</a>  running for office is scared. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2269.169">Whether</a>  you're listening to this in Medford or some other community, I hope you consider too. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2274.41">I</a>  mean, Lori Trahan always said this to me, who is my former boss. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2277.911">She</a>  always said, lean in, lean in. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2280.271">It's</a>  scary, but lean into the fights, the hard fights. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2283.852">And</a>  I hope everyone in the city does that over the next two years. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2287.773">And</a>  I hope if I'm fortunate enough to be elected, people hold my feet to the fire. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2292.094">as</a>  we're sitting next to a fire. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2294.736">I</a>  hope that the people hold me and the other, if fortunate enough, other six Councilors accountable, hold the mayor accountable, hold your state reps accountable, your state senators. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2305.542">You</a>  know, these people, they made promises to you. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2308.143">And</a>  they, you know, Rome wasn't built in a day. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2310.204">It's</a>  not going to happen overnight, but you should really see some, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2315.687">good</a>  transformation in Medford in the next few years. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2319.588">And</a>  hopefully that's transformation we all benefit from, whether it's a revitalized Medford Square, an infrastructure plan for our streets, dramatically better Medford High School, continuing, like look at our recreation program as a young department, what they've been able to do since 2015. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2336.711">We</a>  have to continue to provide resources to build out Medford Rec and get trees, trees on every street. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2346.573">And</a>  so I hope that that's the transformation we see in the next few years, that people start to really, you know, this community has so much pride. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2356.656">So</a>  much pride. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2357.776">It's</a>  blown me away. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2358.796">That's</a>  really like, we've knocked about 9,000 doors the past six months. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2364.118">Our</a>  team's definitely tired. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2365.918">But</a>  everyone's shared so many stories with us along the way, and we carry those stories. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2370.061">And</a>  a lot of them are what people love about Medford, what they see in Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2374.143">And</a>  so we just need a city that really reflects what people already see in the city, you know? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2380.548">I'm</a>  so hopeful and confident we can do that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2384.07">And</a>  I just, I always say, you know, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2387.241">It</a>  matters so much what happens at City Hall, even though people don't watch it like they watch CNN or Fox News. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2394.73">Your</a>  access to the ballot box is decided at City Hall, not the U.S. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2398.154">Capitol.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2399.055">The</a>  state of your street is decided at City Hall, not the U.S. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2401.879">Capitol.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2403.941">And</a>  so I hope people really feel that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2405.742">I</a>  think they are. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2407.444">We</a>  keep saying we're cautiously optimistic. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2411.247">I</a>  can give my final ask to listeners, but I don't want to cut you off if it's not time.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2464.777">That's</a>  amazing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2465.758">It's</a>  amazing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2466.538">And,</a>  you know, it's open City Hall hours this week through Thursday. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2470.741">If</a>  you're voting by mail, those should be in the mail today. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2473.842">They're</a>  really saying tomorrow would be the last day to put that in the mail. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2476.984">Otherwise,</a>  you should drop that at City Hall. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2479.506">And</a>  then, of course, vote November 2nd on Election Day. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2482.668">Polls</a>  are open, I believe it's 7 to 8. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2486.45">Sorry,</a>  my brain's a little fried, but yeah, it's 7. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2488.351">seven</a>  to eight, and so get out and vote, bring your friends, bring your family, it matters. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2493.354">It</a>  matters so much who we pick right now. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2496.335">So</a>  I hope people are feeling that urgency. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2498.517">I</a>  know I am, but I've also been doing this for six months and it's been awesome, but I'm also so excited to see what happens here. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2506.481">I</a>  hope that our hard work pays off and that Medford sees our vision and agrees it's the best vision for Medford.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2514.185">I</a>  know I realized that I've started thinking about politics and elections in the same way I think about big sporting events. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2520.207">So</a>  I'm really excited to think about the outcome. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2523.448">So</a>  you mentioned that today is Monday. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2525.349">We're</a>  recording this on Monday the 25th. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2527.009">So</a>  people should get their ballots in the mail today if they're mailing in. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2530.811">But</a>  definitely by tomorrow.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2532.111">Tomorrow</a>  the latest, the 26th. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2534.932">Tomorrow</a>  the latest. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2536.313">Because</a>  they say it takes about five to seven days with USPS. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2540.575">If</a>  you're feeling any sense of uncertainty, there is a Dropbox on the side of City Hall. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2545.057">It's</a>  labeled very clearly, ballot Dropbox. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2547.978">You</a>  can put them there. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2548.818">It's</a>  very secure. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2550.779">I've</a>  asked City Hall a bunch of questions about how this works. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2553.9">So</a>  I know it's a secure process. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2556.201">But</a>  we should all think of democracy just like <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2560.76">your</a>  personal health, right, in working out and eating healthy, you kind of have to do it every day. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2567.349">Otherwise,</a>  you're out of shape, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2569.252">And</a>  that's the same with democracy. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2571.094">We</a>  have to do this every day to keep our community in a really healthy place. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2577.142">And</a>  so I hope voters think of it that way, like a sporting event, or like working out that this is such a big deal, because it shapes what the next two years of your life, and longer, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2587.984">The</a>  decisions made over the next two years could impact generations. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2592.845">And</a>  they have, they have. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2594.045">I've</a>  been, I'm the product of many Medford policies in our public schools, and in general planning for the city, and our parks program, and so, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2603.927">I've</a>  gone on long enough, but I hope people feel that urgency.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Swk3YjpWn6PbgcGWnnAJ1?t=2608.25">Yeah,</a>  no, I think this will be a lot of really useful information for folks.</p>
