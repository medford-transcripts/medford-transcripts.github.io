1
00:00:08,694 --> 00:00:10,896
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for supplying us a new copy.

2
00:00:11,657 --> 00:00:12,757
[SPEAKER_15]: That was one of my questions.

3
00:00:13,038 --> 00:00:20,022
[SPEAKER_15]: But on page 7 of 40, about a little bit less than halfway down, there is a payment of $1,000.

4
00:00:20,243 --> 00:00:23,225
[SPEAKER_15]: It says pending classification.

5
00:00:25,086 --> 00:00:27,288
[SPEAKER_15]: And I was just wondering what that item was for.

6
00:00:28,108 --> 00:00:28,649
[SPEAKER_16]: That's correct.

7
00:00:28,689 --> 00:00:34,633
[SPEAKER_15]: That's a miscellaneous gifts and refund account for the scholarship limb prize.

8
00:00:35,377 --> 00:00:49,646
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, and there was another one that also had another $1,000, so that was later in, so it's probably another scholarship, and that was on page 20 of 40, and the second one from the bottom.

9
00:01:01,813 --> 00:01:03,374
[SPEAKER_15]: And what was the amount of that, please?

10
00:01:03,614 --> 00:01:03,815
[SPEAKER_15]: Again, $1,000.

11
00:01:06,012 --> 00:01:09,894
[SPEAKER_15]: It's the very bottom of the page, the second one up, it says pending classification.

12
00:01:10,114 --> 00:01:12,055
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, that is the same account, yes.

13
00:01:12,075 --> 00:01:12,796
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

14
00:01:13,356 --> 00:01:27,523
[SPEAKER_15]: So my next question was, sorry, on, oh, that was the duplicate payment to someplace, so you already rectified that by giving us a new thing.

15
00:01:27,923 --> 00:01:29,924
[SPEAKER_15]: Another question I had was on page 25 of 40.

16
00:01:32,345 --> 00:01:36,969
[SPEAKER_15]: and it's dated July 23rd, and it's for $625.30.

17
00:01:37,189 --> 00:01:46,557
[SPEAKER_15]: It's the fifth one up from the bottom, and it says school committee superintendents choose Beverly Nelson, but Ms.

18
00:01:46,597 --> 00:01:49,419
[SPEAKER_15]: Nelson retired prior to that date.

19
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:57,306
[SPEAKER_08]: Correct, this is for the transition period for the superintendent and assistant superintendent conference.

20
00:01:58,935 --> 00:02:01,418
[SPEAKER_15]: Are we paying for the dues for the year for Ms.

21
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:03,319
[SPEAKER_15]: Nelson as well as Mr. Nelson?

22
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:10,646
[SPEAKER_08]: No, this was for the one conference during July for the transition period for all new membership.

23
00:02:10,786 --> 00:02:12,308
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, thank you for clearing that up.

24
00:02:13,228 --> 00:02:17,612
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe that was my last question, and thank you.

25
00:02:17,632 --> 00:02:22,437
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a question about

26
00:02:23,016 --> 00:02:25,257
[SPEAKER_04]: classification that I see many times.

27
00:02:25,778 --> 00:02:29,800
[SPEAKER_04]: There's tuition listed, and then there's special education out of district tuition.

28
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,260
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you explain the difference?

29
00:02:32,741 --> 00:02:35,503
[SPEAKER_08]: It depends on the funding program.

30
00:02:35,563 --> 00:02:42,026
[SPEAKER_08]: So tuition, if it's starting with a 113, that's typically the IDEA grant.

31
00:02:42,567 --> 00:02:49,110
[SPEAKER_08]: There are other special ed out of district tuition that is 010, and that's out of our regular budget.

32
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:51,671
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

33
00:03:11,308 --> 00:03:16,433
[SPEAKER_04]: I noticed in many places there are school-specific miscellaneous charges.

34
00:03:16,453 --> 00:03:21,457
[SPEAKER_04]: I won't list them all, but for instance, on page 14 at the bottom.

35
00:03:25,301 --> 00:03:25,761
[SPEAKER_08]: Correct.

36
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:31,666
[SPEAKER_08]: If it begins with an 890, that is the school building student activity account.

37
00:03:31,786 --> 00:03:37,872
[SPEAKER_08]: So that is a, it's coming through on the warrant as the follow-up for the actual checks that are written.

38
00:03:40,162 --> 00:03:52,653
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, I had a question about, this is not just about this spending on vocational supplies for automotive on page 19.

39
00:03:52,794 --> 00:04:03,143
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually have a question about the supplies that we purchased, but when somebody brings a car in to get worked on, they have to pay for the work.

40
00:04:03,503 --> 00:04:03,763
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct.

41
00:04:03,823 --> 00:04:06,906
[SPEAKER_04]: When, you know, if I bring my car in to get worked on and I write the check,

42
00:04:07,302 --> 00:04:10,065
[SPEAKER_04]: Where does the money go since it doesn't show up here?

43
00:04:10,445 --> 00:04:11,005
[SPEAKER_08]: That's correct.

44
00:04:11,025 --> 00:04:12,847
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is an expenditure report.

45
00:04:12,907 --> 00:04:17,852
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is a revolving fund for the automotive and or other vocational programs.

46
00:04:18,352 --> 00:04:21,415
[SPEAKER_08]: So this goes back into the revolving fund.

47
00:04:21,495 --> 00:04:27,140
[SPEAKER_08]: So they issue an invoice based on the materials ordered for that particular job.

48
00:04:27,821 --> 00:04:31,584
[SPEAKER_08]: The material is purchased, paid for, and then the customer

49
00:04:34,135 --> 00:04:40,278
[SPEAKER_08]: pays the bill in essence, and it's shown as a revenue, a receipt, within this revolving program.

50
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:42,179
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's its own true fund.

51
00:04:49,602 --> 00:04:53,404
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, is this the duplication where the trustees?

52
00:04:53,564 --> 00:04:54,045
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

53
00:04:54,145 --> 00:04:55,365
[SPEAKER_04]: I won't ask about that then.

54
00:04:56,086 --> 00:04:58,907
[SPEAKER_04]: Is the duplication?

55
00:05:05,703 --> 00:05:13,210
[SPEAKER_04]: That was, oh, this one here.

56
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:19,957
[SPEAKER_04]: On page 38, New England School Services for $42,000.

57
00:05:20,577 --> 00:05:22,439
[SPEAKER_04]: It's sort of about 2 3rds of the way down.

58
00:05:25,162 --> 00:05:28,885
[SPEAKER_04]: Just because it's such a big number, I was like, well, what is that for?

59
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:37,002
[SPEAKER_08]: That is the cleaning contract within building and grounds.

60
00:05:40,063 --> 00:05:40,603
[SPEAKER_04]: That's everything.

61
00:05:40,663 --> 00:05:41,003
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

62
00:05:44,964 --> 00:05:45,625
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, thank you.

63
00:05:48,145 --> 00:05:54,107
[SPEAKER_03]: On page 17 to 43 of the updated document, there's just a question about classification.

64
00:05:54,828 --> 00:05:57,729
[SPEAKER_03]: I notice there's a national grid, but it's listed as unclassified.

65
00:05:57,789 --> 00:05:58,969
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just curious about that.

66
00:06:02,578 --> 00:06:04,339
[SPEAKER_08]: National grid is unclassified?

67
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:08,062
[SPEAKER_03]: It's check number 0237291.

68
00:06:08,102 --> 00:06:10,703
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if that helps.

69
00:06:10,743 --> 00:06:10,903
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

70
00:06:10,923 --> 00:06:10,963
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

71
00:06:12,524 --> 00:06:15,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Just curious why that wouldn't show up as utilities.

72
00:06:19,969 --> 00:06:22,110
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you give me the dollar amount that you're referring to?

73
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:22,331
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, sure.

74
00:06:22,351 --> 00:06:22,511
[SPEAKER_03]: It's $2,141.

75
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:23,851
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about right dead center of the page, 17 of 43.

76
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:41,481
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you looking at the new?

77
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:43,761
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'm looking at the updated document.

78
00:06:43,781 --> 00:06:44,261
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

79
00:06:44,861 --> 00:06:45,121
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

80
00:06:45,141 --> 00:06:46,462
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's, I'm sorry.

81
00:06:57,644 --> 00:07:04,065
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so that is actually a void check, and that was, yes, within a revolving account area.

82
00:07:05,065 --> 00:07:05,386
[SPEAKER_03]: I see.

83
00:07:06,326 --> 00:07:07,406
[SPEAKER_03]: And another question.

84
00:07:08,288 --> 00:07:09,328
[SPEAKER_03]: It's looking at electricity.

85
00:07:09,949 --> 00:07:11,169
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there was one that came up.

86
00:07:11,189 --> 00:07:12,389
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's on page 7.

87
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:15,550
[SPEAKER_03]: It's on the updated document, 7 of 43.

88
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:15,990
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

89
00:07:17,631 --> 00:07:18,511
[SPEAKER_03]: Standard Electric.

90
00:07:18,711 --> 00:07:20,832
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it says Educational Supplies.

91
00:07:21,612 --> 00:07:23,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Standard Electric, a vendor?

92
00:07:24,433 --> 00:07:24,793
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.

93
00:07:24,813 --> 00:07:26,193
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, they're a supplied vendor.

94
00:07:26,213 --> 00:07:26,273
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

95
00:07:26,293 --> 00:07:29,254
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so when I was looking at electricity, I was curious about that.

96
00:07:29,915 --> 00:07:30,455
[SPEAKER_17]: OK, thank you.

97
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:30,675
[SPEAKER_17]: OK.

98
00:08:10,679 --> 00:08:20,647
[SPEAKER_26]: This summer, I went in and I signed the bills at City Hall, the same schedule as usual on Wednesdays, and I communicated to all the colleagues with an email message.

99
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:25,905
[SPEAKER_26]: provided some highlights, you know, from the weekly reports that I got.

100
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:28,227
[SPEAKER_26]: And everything went smooth.

101
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:31,870
[SPEAKER_26]: And I want to thank my colleague, Paulette Van de Koot.

102
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:34,372
[SPEAKER_26]: She covered for me while I was on vacation for two weeks.

103
00:08:34,813 --> 00:08:36,775
[SPEAKER_26]: And everything went smooth those two weeks as well.

104
00:08:36,855 --> 00:08:38,016
[SPEAKER_26]: And it was great.

105
00:08:38,096 --> 00:08:40,178
[SPEAKER_26]: It was a very, you know, everything went very smooth.

106
00:08:40,218 --> 00:08:43,881
[SPEAKER_26]: And I just want to thank everybody, you know, who helped and participated.

107
00:08:43,921 --> 00:08:45,863
[SPEAKER_26]: It was a great, thank you.

108
00:09:02,877 --> 00:09:05,879
[SPEAKER_18]: Can I make a motion for the suspension of the rules today?

109
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:14,405
[SPEAKER_18]: It's out of order for item 11, negotiations, item 1, the report of opening of schools, and item 6, the report on buildings and grounds.

110
00:09:23,193 --> 00:09:23,973
[SPEAKER_13]: To take paper, item 11, negotiations.

111
00:09:24,494 --> 00:09:28,896
[SPEAKER_13]: The first item she had, item 1, before voting, is to vote on the crowns.

112
00:09:29,056 --> 00:09:33,458
[SPEAKER_13]: The first item, item 11, is negotiations on online matters.

113
00:09:33,478 --> 00:09:37,319
[SPEAKER_13]: We'd like to accommodate our attorney here, who has not stayed in the meeting.

114
00:09:37,339 --> 00:09:40,521
[SPEAKER_13]: So I guess that's what we're going to do.

115
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:50,465
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to have two executive sessions to ratify our local worldly agreement with the teachers association.

116
00:09:54,116 --> 00:10:00,719
[SPEAKER_19]: Is there a motion on the floor for executive session?

117
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:00,959
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

118
00:10:00,979 --> 00:10:01,760
[SPEAKER_19]: Seconded by Ms.

119
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:02,160

Yes.

Ms.

127
00:10:10,223 --> 00:10:12,064
[SPEAKER_13]: Giugiaro.

[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

129
00:10:14,986 --> 00:10:15,066
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

Mayor Burr.

136
00:10:17,847 --> 00:10:17,907
Yes.

137
00:10:50,949 --> 00:10:57,594
[SPEAKER_16]: and there was a motion on the floor in executive session to ratify, accept the ratification of the Medford Teachers Association contract.

138
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:05,841
[SPEAKER_16]: The teachers did vote on this last week, I believe, and Madam Superintendent, would you like to say a few words on this topic?

139
00:11:06,441 --> 00:11:17,930
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, I'm very pleased to announce that the school committee unanimously agreed to accept the memorandum of agreement that was ratified by the Teachers Union and

140
00:11:19,185 --> 00:11:23,907
[SPEAKER_20]: The motion was passed by Erin DeBenedetto, and Ms.

141
00:11:23,947 --> 00:11:25,168
[SPEAKER_20]: VanderKloot seconded.

142
00:11:25,188 --> 00:11:27,469
[SPEAKER_16]: Seconded the motion, and it was a seven to zero vote.

143
00:11:27,549 --> 00:11:28,470
[SPEAKER_16]: Now we're out on the floor.

144
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:29,971
[SPEAKER_16]: Is there a motion on the floor, Ms.

145
00:11:29,991 --> 00:11:32,512
[SPEAKER_16]: DeBenedetto, to approve the teacher's contract?

146
00:11:32,532 --> 00:11:33,612
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion to approve.

00:11:34,233 --> 00:11:35,794

00:11:37,134 --> 00:11:38,395
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion to second.

150
00:11:38,435 --> 00:11:39,335

[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

155
00:11:58,841 --> 00:12:08,286
[SPEAKER_19]: It's just a wonderful thing for us to be starting out this school year with the teacher's contract in place.

156
00:12:08,566 --> 00:12:17,752
[SPEAKER_19]: And so that for all the people who worked on it and made sure that it happened so that we could cast our votes tonight, we're very, very happy and thankful.

157
00:12:18,605 --> 00:12:19,005
[SPEAKER_16]: Very good.

158
00:12:19,226 --> 00:12:19,626
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

159
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:26,412
[SPEAKER_16]: Also, while we're under suspension, the first item is the report on opening of schools, school year 18-19.

160
00:12:26,472 --> 00:12:30,556
[SPEAKER_16]: Madam Superintendent, first off, we want to welcome this woman to the City of Medford.

161
00:12:36,709 --> 00:12:47,679
[SPEAKER_16]: We're so lucky to have Dr. Vincent in the room, and she's been working very hard over the summer to try and get as much done as possible, and we know that there was a lot of work to get done.

162
00:12:48,259 --> 00:12:54,385
[SPEAKER_16]: And we applaud you for all your hard work, and we're eager to start, obviously start of the new year, but we're eager to delve into it.

163
00:12:54,445 --> 00:12:56,206
[SPEAKER_16]: So, Madam Superintendent.

164
00:12:57,227 --> 00:12:59,609
[SPEAKER_20]: So I'm so excited to be here this evening.

165
00:12:59,669 --> 00:13:00,050
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

166
00:13:01,653 --> 00:13:06,056
[SPEAKER_20]: I would like to say that I feel that opening of school has been absolutely tremendous.

167
00:13:07,156 --> 00:13:16,201
[SPEAKER_20]: I want to recognize our new student member of the school committee again as well, Jas Versu, and I said we're beginning this journey together this year.

168
00:13:16,781 --> 00:13:27,267
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm very excited to introduce him, and I also would like to recognize that we have several new principals and new administrators who have joined our team.

169
00:13:27,947 --> 00:13:28,488
[SPEAKER_20]: We have

170
00:13:30,344 --> 00:13:38,808
[SPEAKER_20]: I like to call him Captain Principal Michael Downs, who is our new administrator at the Andrews Middle School.

171
00:13:39,268 --> 00:13:47,032
[SPEAKER_20]: I'd like to recognize Mr. Paul DeLeva, who is our new administrator, transitioned from the Andrews to Medford High School.

172
00:13:47,472 --> 00:13:52,635
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you so much for that, your support in working with us.

173
00:13:53,215 --> 00:13:58,157
[SPEAKER_20]: I'd like to also recognize that we have some new assistant headmasters.

174
00:13:58,918 --> 00:13:59,578
[SPEAKER_20]: We have

175
00:14:00,176 --> 00:14:06,260
[SPEAKER_20]: Dr. Stacey Mulligan, who is at Medford High School, here with us today.

176
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:13,305
[SPEAKER_20]: I'd also like to recognize Stephen Burnett, who's with us also here, well, from the high school.

177
00:14:13,926 --> 00:14:21,991
[SPEAKER_20]: I'd like to recognize Katie Champoli, who's new with us this year on the special education team, the coordinator of special ed.

178
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:26,795
[SPEAKER_20]: And for our supervisor of mathematics, we have Miss Faiza Khan,

179
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:37,914
[SPEAKER_20]: is working with us, so I wanted to just recognize all of the new members of the team who are working with us to really ensure that this is a very strong year.

180
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:48,959
[SPEAKER_20]: And in addition to just these opening comments about feeling that I've had a tremendous start, I'd like to just take a few moments to show you a visual image of that.

181
00:14:49,239 --> 00:14:50,260
[SPEAKER_16]: Excellent, thank you.

182
00:19:34,075 --> 00:19:34,815
and I am so happy to be here with her.

183
00:19:34,835 --> 00:19:36,156
So, I'm happy to have her here today at Harvard School.

184
00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:38,197
And I'm so happy to have her here today at Harvard School.

185
00:19:38,217 --> 00:19:39,437

00:19:40,658 --> 00:19:42,339

188
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:43,859

00:19:43,879 --> 00:19:45,660

[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm so happy to have her here today at Harvard School.

[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm so happy to have her here today at Harvard School.

[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm so happy to have her here today at Harvard School.

197
00:19:59,726 --> 00:20:01,007
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm so happy to have her here today at Harvard School.

198
00:20:01,067 --> 00:20:01,207
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm

199
00:20:09,602 --> 00:20:14,555
I'm going to say, at the end of this school, don't look back at all.

200
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:02,749
Yes, sir.

201
00:21:29,514 --> 00:21:30,617
[SPEAKER_13]: Going out to make visual.

202
00:21:31,339 --> 00:21:34,887
[SPEAKER_13]: And we're going out to the hot end to see the fresh water condition.

203
00:22:24,651 --> 00:22:31,317
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, clearly, as you can see, she rolled out the red carpet for our teachers and administrators, and it was just an awesome feeling to be part of that.

204
00:22:31,957 --> 00:22:40,985
[SPEAKER_16]: And it was just a wonderful start to show appreciation for the fundamental people that really make our school system as great as it is.

205
00:22:41,085 --> 00:22:44,568
[SPEAKER_16]: So, thank you, Dr. Maurice, for that wonderful start of the school year.

206
00:22:47,719 --> 00:22:53,741
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Benedetto, I heard that Dr. Maurice might have ridden the school bus.

207
00:22:53,761 --> 00:22:54,221
[SPEAKER_15]: She did.

208
00:22:54,441 --> 00:22:55,261
[SPEAKER_15]: I heard that too.

209
00:22:55,281 --> 00:22:56,382
[SPEAKER_19]: She did.

210
00:22:56,902 --> 00:23:01,703
[SPEAKER_15]: Word got around town very quickly that you were on the school bus.

211
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:03,364
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, I did.

212
00:23:03,384 --> 00:23:13,407
[SPEAKER_20]: I rode the school bus day one and I got on bus 10 and it took me to the Columbus School.

213
00:23:14,305 --> 00:23:22,827
[SPEAKER_20]: And so I surprised all the children, the bus driver, and the parents that were waiting at the bus stop.

214
00:23:22,867 --> 00:23:26,268
[SPEAKER_20]: So I just wanted to say happy first day.

215
00:23:26,548 --> 00:23:28,088
[SPEAKER_20]: I think I was more excited than they were.

216
00:23:28,829 --> 00:23:31,909
[SPEAKER_20]: But it was definitely an enjoyable experience.

217
00:23:31,969 --> 00:23:33,810
[SPEAKER_20]: And they were very well behaved for me, by the way.

218
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:36,150
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, I'm sure they were.

219
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:39,671
[SPEAKER_15]: I just wanted to know if you started a sing-along while you were on the bus.

220
00:23:40,051 --> 00:23:41,192
[SPEAKER_20]: No, no sing-alongs.

221
00:23:41,252 --> 00:23:42,772
[SPEAKER_20]: We just had conversations.

222
00:23:43,683 --> 00:23:46,827
[SPEAKER_20]: everyone was excited about it being the first day of school.

223
00:23:47,127 --> 00:23:54,777
[SPEAKER_15]: It impressed our community to a point where I was getting phone calls that you were on the bus and that's a great way to start the school year.

224
00:23:54,857 --> 00:23:59,823
[SPEAKER_15]: I have high hopes for all our remaining days to go as well.

225
00:24:00,745 --> 00:24:01,526
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for that.

226
00:24:02,765 --> 00:24:07,527
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, I also got calls letting me know that you were on the bus.

227
00:24:08,187 --> 00:24:14,010
[SPEAKER_19]: And people just really felt the same way that I did, that Mr. Benedetto and my colleagues did.

228
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:15,210
[SPEAKER_19]: What a great way to start.

229
00:24:15,971 --> 00:24:16,291
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

230
00:24:16,851 --> 00:24:17,311
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

231
00:24:17,732 --> 00:24:23,214
[SPEAKER_20]: I just want to recognize all the principals and administrators that are here as well this evening.

232
00:24:23,634 --> 00:24:29,577
[SPEAKER_20]: I see Kathy Medaglio, and Bernadette Riccadeli, and Nick Tucci just came.

233
00:24:29,657 --> 00:24:32,258
[SPEAKER_20]: And this is his first official full year as well.

234
00:24:33,486 --> 00:24:41,349
[SPEAKER_20]: being the administrator, and Mr. Kirk Johnson, I see you in the back, and I just want to thank you for your support.

235
00:24:41,709 --> 00:24:47,132
[SPEAKER_20]: I really feel fortunate to be leading Medford Public Schools with such a great team.

236
00:24:48,592 --> 00:24:49,753
[SPEAKER_16]: Very good, thank you so much.

237
00:24:50,393 --> 00:24:52,854
[SPEAKER_16]: Is there a motion to accept this report and place it on file?

238
00:24:53,394 --> 00:24:54,935
[SPEAKER_16]: By Mr. Benedetto, is there a second?

239
00:24:54,955 --> 00:24:55,575
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Russo?

240
00:24:56,951 --> 00:24:57,691
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

241
00:24:57,711 --> 00:24:57,771
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

242
00:24:58,372 --> 00:24:59,152
[SPEAKER_16]: All those opposed?

243
00:24:59,312 --> 00:25:00,093
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion passes.

244
00:25:01,254 --> 00:25:05,116
[SPEAKER_16]: And our next item under suspension, report on building and grounds.

245
00:25:08,898 --> 00:25:09,838
[SPEAKER_16]: Who will be presenting?

246
00:25:25,534 --> 00:25:26,755
[SPEAKER_16]: Good evening, Mr. McLaughlin.

247
00:25:26,815 --> 00:25:27,735
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening, everybody.

248
00:25:27,775 --> 00:25:28,936
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good to see everybody.

249
00:25:30,857 --> 00:25:34,658
[SPEAKER_02]: So, this summer we were very active.

250
00:25:34,878 --> 00:25:39,501
[SPEAKER_02]: We had some great support from the mayor's office and the administration.

251
00:25:39,941 --> 00:25:44,083
[SPEAKER_02]: We were certainly able to get a lot of our projects

252
00:26:01,401 --> 00:26:05,946
[SPEAKER_02]: So at the Andrews Middle School, we were able to get over there and pressure wash.

253
00:26:06,574 --> 00:26:09,156
[SPEAKER_02]: the signage, and we did that in all the schools, too.

254
00:26:09,216 --> 00:26:17,922
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it was something that was near and dear to some people's hearts about, you know, and they needed to be cleaned up, and they look really good.

255
00:26:18,562 --> 00:26:24,186
[SPEAKER_02]: And we did the rugs over at the Andrews School, as well as we did the rugs in all the school libraries.

256
00:26:24,206 --> 00:26:27,068
[SPEAKER_02]: We had the contractor come in and take care of the rugs.

257
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:35,154
[SPEAKER_02]: Over at the Brooks, we did some extensive landscaping performed by groundmasters,

258
00:26:36,736 --> 00:26:37,557
[SPEAKER_02]: pressure washed.

259
00:26:38,797 --> 00:26:45,002
[SPEAKER_02]: We did some wall replacement in a couple of the bathrooms where the walls needed to be.

260
00:26:45,502 --> 00:26:47,584
[SPEAKER_02]: They got a little wet, so we had to replace them.

261
00:26:48,364 --> 00:26:51,867
[SPEAKER_02]: And we did some floor tile work that was needed to be done over there, too.

262
00:26:52,867 --> 00:26:57,971
[SPEAKER_02]: And we purchased a slide that was broken, and we had that replaced.

263
00:26:58,011 --> 00:27:02,154
[SPEAKER_02]: The parks department helped us out with that.

264
00:27:02,254 --> 00:27:06,297
[SPEAKER_02]: And obviously the mayor's capital improvement that's going on right now down there at the new field.

265
00:27:06,932 --> 00:27:09,754
[SPEAKER_02]: If you get a minute to drive by there, you should check that out.

266
00:27:09,774 --> 00:27:10,614
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fantastic.

267
00:27:11,094 --> 00:27:16,337
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be just an excellent place for the kids to play, well-deserved.

268
00:27:17,338 --> 00:27:26,903
[SPEAKER_02]: That field had been a dirt pile for quite a while, and it's refreshing to see that the kids will have a nice surface to play on.

269
00:27:27,867 --> 00:27:33,588
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and then we moved over to the Columbus where we did some more extensive landscaping and added some mulch into the back.

270
00:27:33,988 --> 00:27:39,969
[SPEAKER_02]: We had to raise the wall a little bit to hold the mulch so that we could get it underneath the trees and it wouldn't just go off.

271
00:27:40,009 --> 00:27:41,209
[SPEAKER_02]: And we did some painting.

272
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:46,651
[SPEAKER_02]: We painted the globe, we painted the four squares, the hopscotches, came out really nice.

273
00:27:47,571 --> 00:27:49,771
[SPEAKER_02]: We did some floor tile work down there as well.

274
00:27:49,791 --> 00:27:50,791
[SPEAKER_02]: And,

275
00:27:55,252 --> 00:27:58,293
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a new slide, actually the Parks Department picked it up today.

276
00:27:58,313 --> 00:27:59,454
[SPEAKER_02]: It hasn't been installed yet.

277
00:27:59,834 --> 00:28:01,455
[SPEAKER_02]: They're in the process of installing it.

278
00:28:01,475 --> 00:28:05,297
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully it'll be squared away by at least Monday, the brand new slide.

279
00:28:05,317 --> 00:28:07,178
[SPEAKER_02]: They had a broken slide over there.

280
00:28:07,898 --> 00:28:09,219
[SPEAKER_02]: So that worked out well.

281
00:28:09,379 --> 00:28:16,662
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we had the Department of Corrections, we had them over at the Curtis Tufts doing some painting, moving on to the Curtis Tufts.

282
00:28:18,323 --> 00:28:22,485
[SPEAKER_02]: We rented the equipment to strip and varnish another floor over there.

283
00:28:23,805 --> 00:28:25,146
[SPEAKER_02]: So that came out very good.

284
00:28:25,426 --> 00:28:29,928
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had to tear down the walls because they were making a new cafeteria.

285
00:28:30,269 --> 00:28:32,150
[SPEAKER_02]: So we did some paint and work down there.

286
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:34,291
[SPEAKER_02]: We did some repairs over there as well.

287
00:28:36,252 --> 00:28:38,393
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we move on to the McGlynn.

288
00:28:39,213 --> 00:28:40,514
[SPEAKER_02]: We had the roofing company in.

289
00:28:40,574 --> 00:28:44,216
[SPEAKER_02]: The report states that they haven't been in here, but they did make it down.

290
00:28:44,236 --> 00:28:49,579
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had them go over the whole roof, repair any holes, repair anything that they saw.

291
00:28:52,037 --> 00:28:55,059
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a well-needed fix over there, too.

292
00:28:55,099 --> 00:29:02,363
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully that's gonna stop, if there's anything, stop some of the water, if there's any water, making it through in some of the classrooms.

293
00:29:02,403 --> 00:29:07,226
[SPEAKER_02]: I know some teachers had some concerns at the end of last year.

294
00:29:07,946 --> 00:29:09,547
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was very good.

295
00:29:09,587 --> 00:29:11,568
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, like I said, we did the signage.

296
00:29:12,188 --> 00:29:16,951
[SPEAKER_02]: And then over at Mefford High School, we did an air conditioner project in the main office.

297
00:29:17,531 --> 00:29:18,352
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately,

298
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:24,081
[SPEAKER_02]: The compressor that they put in was defective, so they're bringing a new one in.

299
00:29:24,122 --> 00:29:33,084
[SPEAKER_02]: It should be in shortly, so they haven't had air conditioning in the main office during the heat, but they're going to replace that at no cost.

300
00:29:33,124 --> 00:29:35,005
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a warranty item.

301
00:29:37,645 --> 00:29:42,687
[SPEAKER_02]: We did an air conditioning project in A204 for the kids' corner.

302
00:29:43,235 --> 00:29:49,856
[SPEAKER_02]: kids we added two air conditioners upstairs for their, I think they're their older kids that move upstairs.

303
00:29:49,916 --> 00:29:56,037
[SPEAKER_02]: So that, that one we got, we just got that done basically under the gun on that one and that worked out well.

304
00:29:56,117 --> 00:30:04,199
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to be working on most likely over in the vocational school, the MEEP program where there's young kids.

305
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:08,359
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to be working on trying to put a couple of air conditioners in there shortly too.

306
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:12,220
[SPEAKER_02]: I met with Chad Fallon today about it and then

307
00:30:12,902 --> 00:30:19,249
[SPEAKER_02]: The water bottle fill stations that the PTA purchased down there last year, we were able to get those all installed.

308
00:30:19,349 --> 00:30:20,770
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's six of them.

309
00:30:21,231 --> 00:30:29,219
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we have water bottle fill stations in strategic locations at the vocational school and Medford High School as well.

310
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,541
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was really good.

311
00:30:30,561 --> 00:30:31,762
[SPEAKER_02]: And when they pulled off

312
00:30:33,911 --> 00:30:40,896
[SPEAKER_02]: the old fountains, they were able to fix some cross connection pipe issues that we had there.

313
00:30:41,476 --> 00:30:47,501
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you have a cross connection, sometimes that means hot and cold and mixing, and it's problematic.

314
00:30:47,561 --> 00:30:51,824
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was something that's been going on at the high school for quite a while.

315
00:30:51,864 --> 00:30:57,848
[SPEAKER_02]: So they were able to fix that with the bottle project installation, which was really good.

316
00:30:57,968 --> 00:31:00,650
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a really, really good fix.

317
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:03,252
[SPEAKER_02]: And the forestry department came over.

318
00:31:03,709 --> 00:31:11,534
[SPEAKER_02]: We had some trees that we were worried about, you know, in some certain areas that needed to be taken down.

319
00:31:11,834 --> 00:31:15,316
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there was probably four or five that they took down for us.

320
00:31:15,336 --> 00:31:17,978
[SPEAKER_02]: There was one near door 17 that was very concerning.

321
00:31:18,618 --> 00:31:20,019
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that was a good one.

322
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:24,622
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was a couple of other ones that they came over for us, which was really good.

323
00:31:24,682 --> 00:31:27,443
[SPEAKER_02]: We were really happy about that.

324
00:31:27,884 --> 00:31:31,646
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we did replace two hot water storage tanks.

325
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:36,172
[SPEAKER_02]: that feed the hot water to the front of the building, it was creating rusty water.

326
00:31:36,232 --> 00:31:39,333
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had those replaced this summer as well at the high school.

327
00:31:39,753 --> 00:31:43,895
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was really another real good project that we had done.

328
00:31:44,895 --> 00:31:47,476
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have the Roberts, where we did the rugs.

329
00:31:48,337 --> 00:31:54,379
[SPEAKER_02]: And we did some painting in the school yard of this four square and the globe.

330
00:31:54,499 --> 00:31:55,960
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that really looks good.

331
00:31:56,523 --> 00:32:01,987
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know everybody knows that we're in the process with the play area.

332
00:32:02,947 --> 00:32:04,128
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I got company.

333
00:32:05,169 --> 00:32:22,641
[SPEAKER_02]: But so everybody knows we're in the process with the play area, but just to end it, I just wanted to make sure that we thank Brian Cairns from the DPW, Mike Nesta, Steve Tanaglia, the Forestry Department that were really good to us this summer, and they were

334
00:32:23,477 --> 00:32:29,978
[SPEAKER_02]: We have an excellent relationship with the schools in the Department of Public Works, and we're really able to accomplish a lot.

335
00:32:30,378 --> 00:32:33,399
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been extremely helpful at the Brooks School.

336
00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:40,980
[SPEAKER_02]: We were able to use some old granite that they had in storage in order to make a retaining wall over there.

337
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,201
[SPEAKER_02]: We used some of our own storage granite.

338
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:47,241
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I also, we want to welcome back Mary Jo.

339
00:32:47,741 --> 00:32:48,361
[SPEAKER_02]: She's back.

340
00:32:48,902 --> 00:32:51,202
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank Joanne Mortel for helping out.

341
00:32:53,872 --> 00:32:55,473
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, and Alicia Hunt, obviously.

342
00:32:55,513 --> 00:33:01,157
[SPEAKER_02]: Alicia, she did the project and she's incredible too.

343
00:33:01,577 --> 00:33:14,486
[SPEAKER_02]: She did an unbelievable lighting project at the Andrews School, as well as we finally got back to the cafeterias and replaced all the cafeterias, Brooks, Roberts, Columbus, with LED lighting, which is very, very good.

344
00:33:15,287 --> 00:33:16,208
[SPEAKER_16]: Very good, thank you.

345
00:33:17,629 --> 00:33:18,689
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Benedetto.

346
00:33:23,682 --> 00:33:29,584
[SPEAKER_15]: First of all, John, thank you for all the work and your whole department for keeping the schools as nice as they are.

347
00:33:30,444 --> 00:33:34,526
[SPEAKER_15]: I know it's a big job with the short budget and you do great work.

348
00:33:34,946 --> 00:33:41,808
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's great when we get support and we're all working together and we're saying, hey, let's go do this.

349
00:33:41,868 --> 00:33:48,490
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I know we can't do everything, but when we're together, we can get a lot done, which is nice.

350
00:33:49,363 --> 00:33:54,764
[SPEAKER_15]: So with regards to that, I'm still hoping that all schools can get their windows washed at some point.

351
00:33:55,144 --> 00:33:55,804
[SPEAKER_15]: That's a goal.

352
00:33:56,124 --> 00:34:05,026
[SPEAKER_15]: And maybe we can maybe get some bids this year so we can arrange for that to happen in the spring, because I think it will make a big difference in every building.

353
00:34:06,006 --> 00:34:10,607
[SPEAKER_15]: I know it's probably going to be a big cost, or we're going to have to do it in-house with the right equipment.

354
00:34:10,827 --> 00:34:11,647
[SPEAKER_15]: I know it's not an easy job.

355
00:34:11,667 --> 00:34:16,248
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, maybe we can get together and do a school by school, year by year, and just chip away at it.

356
00:34:16,923 --> 00:34:23,926
[SPEAKER_02]: Incidentally, too, I did have a contractor in today to give us a price for air conditioning in the theater, so we'll be getting that shortly, too.

357
00:34:23,966 --> 00:34:26,928
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a request that we got earlier this summer as well.

358
00:34:26,968 --> 00:34:29,009
[SPEAKER_16]: We have an estimate for the Columbus as well.

359
00:34:29,449 --> 00:34:31,550
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, yeah.

360
00:34:31,930 --> 00:34:34,351
[SPEAKER_15]: My next question was about the high school pool.

361
00:34:34,551 --> 00:34:40,494
[SPEAKER_15]: I know there were some issues with that, and maybe you could update us as to where we are with that right now.

362
00:34:40,874 --> 00:34:41,355
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that open?

363
00:34:42,767 --> 00:34:45,948
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the pool's back open.

364
00:34:46,208 --> 00:34:47,728
[SPEAKER_02]: Rachel Perry did an excellent job.

365
00:34:48,248 --> 00:34:56,610
[SPEAKER_02]: They saw that there was a little bit of an issue when they were doing their regular maintenance, and John Bovuso from the building department came right up.

366
00:34:57,210 --> 00:35:04,972
[SPEAKER_02]: He gave us a contractor that was able to come in there and fix it, and we were back in action in less than a week, I think.

367
00:35:05,572 --> 00:35:06,013
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.

368
00:35:06,193 --> 00:35:07,953
[SPEAKER_02]: They filled it up, and I went up there to

369
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:13,514
[SPEAKER_02]: I went up there the other day looking, thinking I was gonna be inspecting it, and they were swimming.

370
00:35:13,734 --> 00:35:14,915
[SPEAKER_15]: So I was like, oh, this is great.

371
00:35:15,616 --> 00:35:28,606
[SPEAKER_15]: So could, not directed to you, but could we get an update on the costs involved, and what was done, and how long it does, and any maintenance issues that we're gonna make sure that we're okay for that for future.

372
00:35:28,886 --> 00:35:30,748
[SPEAKER_15]: I know the pool was just done six years ago.

373
00:35:30,788 --> 00:35:36,973
[SPEAKER_15]: I just wanna make sure we maintain that, because we did put a couple million dollars into that project, and we wanna make sure

374
00:35:37,374 --> 00:35:39,815
[SPEAKER_15]: we're maintaining the things that we're investing in.

375
00:35:39,835 --> 00:35:40,995
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're very thorough with them.

376
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:42,155
[SPEAKER_02]: Every year they do the maintenance.

377
00:35:42,255 --> 00:35:42,856
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know we have.

378
00:35:42,956 --> 00:35:45,536
[SPEAKER_15]: For six years to have no issues is a really good thing.

379
00:35:45,556 --> 00:35:47,037
[SPEAKER_15]: And it gets used.

380
00:35:47,417 --> 00:35:55,279
[SPEAKER_02]: And because they were doing the maintenance, they were able to head off what may have, you know, could have been a good-sized problem.

381
00:35:55,299 --> 00:35:59,040
[SPEAKER_02]: So they were just, by doing the maintenance alone, which was.

382
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:05,222
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for addressing some of our early childhood students' air conditioning needs, because that was requested

383
00:36:05,569 --> 00:36:12,597
[SPEAKER_15]: like two or three years ago, you and I had, well, you had done some good work over there, and I'm glad to see that continue.

384
00:36:12,777 --> 00:36:15,760
[SPEAKER_15]: As well as the Curtis Tufts School.

385
00:36:16,121 --> 00:36:22,287
[SPEAKER_15]: I can't wait till every floor is that beautiful golden oak and not that darker color.

386
00:36:22,808 --> 00:36:25,551
[SPEAKER_15]: I know you haven't forgotten about that building, and I appreciate that.

387
00:36:28,024 --> 00:36:34,247
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a couple of other items that I do have to take care of for Brian before the winter sets in.

388
00:36:35,108 --> 00:36:36,448
[SPEAKER_02]: Things were going so fast.

389
00:36:38,229 --> 00:36:51,175
[SPEAKER_15]: I just wanted to acknowledge those things and just make sure that the beautification that happened outside the schools with the mulch and the flowers, that really makes people happy walking into the building, not just the people who work there.

390
00:36:51,735 --> 00:36:55,457
[SPEAKER_15]: The people who work there, the children that attend there, their families, and it's the

391
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:58,931
[SPEAKER_15]: first and last thing people see when they're walking through our doors.

392
00:36:59,292 --> 00:37:03,974
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'd like to continue with that being a priority with our staff.

393
00:37:04,875 --> 00:37:17,441
[SPEAKER_15]: I do have another question about how the money for the turf field came about, because it just wasn't clear to me as a member how that happened.

394
00:37:17,521 --> 00:37:21,123
[SPEAKER_15]: So I don't know if that's a question for the mayor or the superintendent.

395
00:37:21,143 --> 00:37:22,704
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, that came through the linkage account.

396
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:26,510
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not familiar with the linkage account and what that does.

397
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:29,413
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a city account that's put in from development.

398
00:37:30,293 --> 00:37:31,334
[SPEAKER_16]: And can people hear me?

399
00:37:31,674 --> 00:37:36,278
[SPEAKER_16]: So it gets deposited into four different linkage accounts, four different linkage accounts.

400
00:37:36,358 --> 00:37:42,844
[SPEAKER_16]: So we have a water and sewer, roads, we have public safety, and we have a parks linkage account.

401
00:37:43,524 --> 00:37:49,589
[SPEAKER_16]: And that particular school is not adjacent to or within walking distance of a park.

402
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:51,671
[SPEAKER_16]: And it was a dirt pit, basically.

403
00:37:51,691 --> 00:37:53,072
[SPEAKER_16]: So kids every day were going home.

404
00:37:53,578 --> 00:37:54,878
[SPEAKER_16]: So we thought it was urgent.

405
00:37:55,079 --> 00:37:59,080
[SPEAKER_16]: We saw the reports last spring, and we addressed it.

406
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:03,081
[SPEAKER_16]: So it was under $50,000 from the city to get that done.

407
00:38:03,942 --> 00:38:09,304
[SPEAKER_16]: And I know Christine has a report as well that she wants to continue along in regards to buildings and grounds.

408
00:38:11,304 --> 00:38:12,625
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

409
00:38:12,885 --> 00:38:13,185
[SPEAKER_16]: Certainly.

410
00:38:13,205 --> 00:38:13,345
[SPEAKER_16]: Ms.

411
00:38:13,425 --> 00:38:13,945
[SPEAKER_16]: Van de Kloot.

412
00:38:15,646 --> 00:38:20,868
[SPEAKER_19]: John, I just wanted to ask, obviously, we've had a very hot start to the school year.

413
00:38:22,192 --> 00:38:27,214
[SPEAKER_19]: How was bringing all of our air conditioning on and did it work?

414
00:38:27,954 --> 00:38:41,640
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's certainly no secret that we do have some compressor issues in some of our buildings and it's certainly something that we have to look into at some point.

415
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:49,623
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that a few years ago when we were gathering our information for the capital plan,

416
00:38:50,087 --> 00:38:54,389
[SPEAKER_02]: It was certainly something that we have on our list, high priority.

417
00:38:55,109 --> 00:38:58,430
[SPEAKER_02]: It's over $15,000 a compressor.

418
00:38:58,931 --> 00:39:13,136
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you have, you know, a unit on the roof that has four and two of them are running, it's, you know, it's going to take the curse off, but it's not really going to be what you want it to be.

419
00:39:14,037 --> 00:39:16,157
[SPEAKER_02]: The good part about it is not all of them are broken.

420
00:39:16,198 --> 00:39:17,218
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were able to move,

421
00:39:17,863 --> 00:39:21,565
[SPEAKER_02]: move kids around where they could get relief.

422
00:39:21,645 --> 00:39:28,570
[SPEAKER_02]: And obviously the superintendent allocated us to go out and purchase water.

423
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:32,793
[SPEAKER_02]: So we purchased one day, I think we purchased 80 cases of water.

424
00:39:33,213 --> 00:39:40,097
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the next day we ordered another 80 cases of water to make sure that there was plenty of water there for the kids getting on the bus, riding home.

425
00:39:41,238 --> 00:39:47,422
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an unfortunate circumstance of it being so hot this late in the year, I guess.

426
00:39:48,126 --> 00:40:05,279
[SPEAKER_19]: All right, so can you, if I could ask for a follow-up report of each of the schools and where we are in terms of the compressors, how many we need, so that we're aware of it, because obviously with the start of school like this, we need it to come online and work.

427
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:07,180
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely, we can update the report, sure.

428
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,142
[SPEAKER_02]: No problem.

429
00:40:09,182 --> 00:40:09,682
[SPEAKER_16]: Very good.

430
00:40:09,702 --> 00:40:09,762
[SPEAKER_16]: Ms.

431
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:10,223
[SPEAKER_16]: Patterson.

432
00:40:12,845 --> 00:40:13,105
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, Ms.

433
00:40:13,145 --> 00:40:13,785
[SPEAKER_16]: Kretz, I'm sorry.

434
00:40:13,805 --> 00:40:16,707
[SPEAKER_26]: Good question, I just wanted to say I ended up

435
00:40:17,735 --> 00:40:20,117
[SPEAKER_26]: taking a ride over to each school this summer.

436
00:40:20,137 --> 00:40:23,640
[SPEAKER_26]: And, you know, I just want to say they all look great.

437
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:28,644
[SPEAKER_26]: Like the paint, the playground paint, the mulch, everything was trimmed.

438
00:40:28,764 --> 00:40:29,665
[SPEAKER_26]: It's all cleaned up.

439
00:40:30,085 --> 00:40:31,346
[SPEAKER_26]: It just looks so nice.

440
00:40:31,666 --> 00:40:43,316
[SPEAKER_26]: It looked really pretty, you know, and I just want to thank everybody who helped because it was every school and I, you know, I was, you know, communicating with John a lot over the summer and, you know, he worked really hard.

441
00:40:43,376 --> 00:40:45,077
[SPEAKER_26]: Everybody worked really hard and it was a hot summer.

442
00:40:45,676 --> 00:40:47,297
[SPEAKER_26]: and everything looks great, and that's it.

443
00:40:47,377 --> 00:40:48,958
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks.

444
00:40:49,018 --> 00:40:49,339
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

445
00:40:50,219 --> 00:40:50,399
[SPEAKER_08]: Ms.

446
00:40:50,419 --> 00:40:50,860
[SPEAKER_08]: Patterson.

447
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:51,941
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

448
00:40:52,121 --> 00:41:01,407
[SPEAKER_08]: So within your packet, there's a supplemental document provided, and this is a timeline for the Roberts Elementary Playground renovation project.

449
00:41:01,948 --> 00:41:10,414
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'd first like to applaud Cheryl Rodriguez and the parents and community of the Roberts for all of their support in this project.

450
00:41:10,754 --> 00:41:14,677
[SPEAKER_08]: And it has been a time-consuming process, however,

451
00:41:15,325 --> 00:41:21,228
[SPEAKER_08]: I am very excited and hopeful for the end result, which will be occurring.

452
00:41:21,868 --> 00:41:38,797
[SPEAKER_08]: So as we go through the milestones and look at the actual dates of what has transpired for this process, the very start back in January of 2018, Mrs. Rodriguez engaged community support through the grant process, through the CPA application.

453
00:41:39,177 --> 00:41:43,119
[SPEAKER_08]: She obtained signatures, got soft quotes, and started the application process.

454
00:41:44,249 --> 00:41:52,756
[SPEAKER_08]: March 1st, Mrs. Rodriguez worked with the school department for the submission of the CPA application, which was co-signed by Mayor Burke.

455
00:41:53,456 --> 00:42:05,706
[SPEAKER_08]: And that was the consolidation as the partnership between the Roberts PTO and the school department to engage in this CPA first round of funding for Medford.

456
00:42:06,887 --> 00:42:07,168
[SPEAKER_08]: May 29th,

457
00:42:08,213 --> 00:42:16,540
[SPEAKER_08]: The CPA awarded $109,540 for the Roberts PTO application on the playground in conjunction with the school department.

458
00:42:17,341 --> 00:42:24,608
[SPEAKER_08]: So this was identified that it must follow the bidding rules and procurement statutes within this application.

459
00:42:26,009 --> 00:42:32,274
[SPEAKER_08]: June 29th, there were efforts to utilize the NJPA process to expedite some procurement.

460
00:42:32,995 --> 00:42:35,137
[SPEAKER_08]: However, attempts to use this particular

461
00:42:36,103 --> 00:42:38,084
[SPEAKER_08]: venue did not meet the quote guidelines.

462
00:42:38,284 --> 00:42:45,408
[SPEAKER_08]: It exceeded the $50,000 requirement and required a formal IFB bidding process.

463
00:42:47,029 --> 00:42:59,276
[SPEAKER_08]: July 12th was the posting and the release of the first IFB, and it was required by Mass General Law for the minimum of two weeks with the required four different areas for posting.

464
00:42:59,836 --> 00:43:01,077
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a public

465
00:43:02,118 --> 00:43:11,423
[SPEAKER_08]: process, so it's posted in local newspapers, the local offices, websites, Combis, and the Goods and Services Bulletin.

466
00:43:11,863 --> 00:43:17,446
[SPEAKER_08]: And this was a public process that many folks had access to the document.

467
00:43:17,986 --> 00:43:24,550
[SPEAKER_08]: We reached out to vendors, encouraging those to participate and bid on the project.

468
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:30,613
[SPEAKER_08]: We did have a pre-bid walkthrough for the first round, which was on July 31st.

469
00:43:31,824 --> 00:43:43,027
[SPEAKER_08]: This walkthrough was at the Roberts location and was intended for the vendors to ask questions, measure the spaces, and have any follow-up items identified.

470
00:43:44,367 --> 00:43:46,628
[SPEAKER_08]: On August 6th, the bid was opened.

471
00:43:46,768 --> 00:43:54,850
[SPEAKER_08]: We had only one vendor that provided an actual bid, which was $330,000, which exceeded the grant award by over $200,000.

472
00:43:56,170 --> 00:43:58,891
[SPEAKER_08]: Needless to say, we were very disappointed in that process.

473
00:43:59,311 --> 00:43:59,891
[SPEAKER_08]: We could not

474
00:44:01,171 --> 00:44:22,207
[SPEAKER_08]: We go forward with that sizable increase and we reissued a second bid, a revised bid that we removed a portion of the initial scope of work that was outside that we could potentially do ourselves with the city side landscaper to hopefully reduce the cost.

475
00:44:22,828 --> 00:44:25,750
[SPEAKER_08]: So again, we had to go through the posting process.

476
00:44:26,405 --> 00:44:32,247
[SPEAKER_08]: the minimum of two weeks, and we had a pre-bid walkthrough on August 21st.

477
00:44:32,828 --> 00:44:44,352
[SPEAKER_08]: We did have responding vendors that had questions that were then responded to, and addendum number one was issued to resolve any of those questions regarding the scope of the project.

478
00:44:46,053 --> 00:44:49,534
[SPEAKER_08]: On August 29th, we did have the bid opening.

479
00:44:49,835 --> 00:44:53,136
[SPEAKER_08]: We had three bidders that provided documentation.

480
00:44:53,676 --> 00:44:55,717
[SPEAKER_08]: One vendor was rejected for compliance,

481
00:44:56,828 --> 00:45:02,432
[SPEAKER_08]: The low bid was $223,110, and the next bidder was $224,000.

482
00:45:03,373 --> 00:45:09,137
[SPEAKER_08]: So this round, we did have additional bidders, which was more successful.

483
00:45:09,317 --> 00:45:19,324
[SPEAKER_08]: And given that the next two lowest bidders were right in the same range, this was identified as more reasonable in terms of the cost.

484
00:45:19,624 --> 00:45:25,268
[SPEAKER_08]: However, there is still a significant gap in terms of the original award for the grant.

485
00:45:26,743 --> 00:45:52,580
[SPEAKER_08]: So on September 4th, we engaged with our city side to identify potentials and possibilities for additional funding, an off-cycle process with the CPA, which we have felt that this will be the most efficient and time-sensitive process in order to get that level of funding in place and get the scope of this project completed.

486
00:45:55,538 --> 00:46:08,788
[SPEAKER_08]: The 18th is the amendment deadline to provide the additional application amendment for the additional funding that would complete this project at the $223,110 level.

487
00:46:09,929 --> 00:46:21,958
[SPEAKER_08]: There will be a CPC board meeting scheduled for September 25th, which will be the presentation for the board for recommending funding for this additional component in order to complete this project.

488
00:46:25,170 --> 00:46:37,020
[SPEAKER_08]: October 9th is when the CPC will be reviewing and obtaining votes to approve project funding and bring these particular programs to City Council and the Mayor for review.

489
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:46,208
[SPEAKER_08]: And our hope is to get support from City Council in order to expedite this particular request.

490
00:46:47,749 --> 00:46:49,590
[SPEAKER_08]: October 23rd, the CPC is

491
00:46:51,885 --> 00:46:59,810
[SPEAKER_08]: going to vote for the approval, review the language for the round two funding, and that will be formally submitted to the mayor for consideration.

492
00:47:00,650 --> 00:47:09,516
[SPEAKER_08]: We do have firm contract pricing in line with the lowest second bidder, which will hold firm through October 31st.

493
00:47:10,356 --> 00:47:20,943
[SPEAKER_08]: At such point, we are hopeful that we will have indications for the final funding portion, and we can execute the contract with space, landscape, and construction.

494
00:47:21,973 --> 00:47:39,925
[SPEAKER_08]: Now again, I think it's noteworthy to indicate that the scope of this project is such that this new playground facility will have a structure in place that is much more superior and easier to maintain going forward.

495
00:47:40,005 --> 00:47:50,272
[SPEAKER_08]: These are interlocking, safety rated, fall rated interlocking tiles that in the event that they need to be replaced will be much

496
00:47:50,973 --> 00:48:01,743
[SPEAKER_08]: easier to do so, much more cost efficient in the long run and will last longer where we have the current issue of any type of port situation.

497
00:48:01,763 --> 00:48:09,309
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to deteriorate quicker and you have gaps and areas that are not easily repaired.

498
00:48:10,070 --> 00:48:12,973
[SPEAKER_08]: So the scope of this project will be removal of the

499
00:48:14,051 --> 00:48:33,677
[SPEAKER_08]: old existing playground area graded down to the particular specifications that will be needed to backfill the sublayer material for the new structure that will be put in place, interlocked and secured through glue and worked around the existing playground area.

500
00:48:34,997 --> 00:48:38,338
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, within the scope of the original application,

501
00:48:39,084 --> 00:48:59,998
[SPEAKER_08]: It's noteworthy that some of the measures for success within this project are not just the actual playground environment itself, but it's also inclusive of the rainbow painting on the ground, plantings, and the potential for a rock garden that the students are going to participate in.

502
00:49:00,659 --> 00:49:06,623
[SPEAKER_08]: So it is exceptional that some of this has already taken place, that we are

503
00:49:07,276 --> 00:49:16,158
[SPEAKER_08]: making every effort to get this project done, done right, so that it is lasting for the future and sustainable and maintainable.

504
00:49:16,798 --> 00:49:25,019
[SPEAKER_08]: And that some of these areas for success measures have already taken place with the efforts of Building and Grounds over the summer.

505
00:49:25,699 --> 00:49:36,721
[SPEAKER_08]: And we are working very diligently, very hard with the city hall members and CPC members in order to get this project expedited and funded

506
00:49:37,155 --> 00:49:42,398
[SPEAKER_08]: with the hope that we can get this done before the inclement weather arrives for this fall.

507
00:49:42,538 --> 00:49:50,102
[SPEAKER_16]: And if I could add just one thing from the floor, the timeline that was provided was from Danielle, who is the administrative assistant to the CPC.

508
00:49:50,763 --> 00:49:59,888
[SPEAKER_16]: However, once, I believe in the last round, when all of the projects were presented to the city council, they had a committee of the whole, so they looked at all of them.

509
00:50:00,935 --> 00:50:03,236
[SPEAKER_16]: That was the CPC's plan again.

510
00:50:03,816 --> 00:50:18,302
[SPEAKER_16]: This could be expedited by a couple of weeks if the council took this one separately and maybe deliberated on the other items that are being submitted in a committee of the whole where this project is, they are familiar with this project.

511
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:26,520
[SPEAKER_16]: I think we all realize that the bid came in over three times higher originally and now over two times higher.

512
00:50:27,341 --> 00:50:32,548
[SPEAKER_16]: So we are working diligently to try to get this project done in the fashion that it was intended.

513
00:50:33,193 --> 00:50:42,778
[SPEAKER_16]: and not a quick fix with rubber mulch, or going back to the old-fashioned full pour, which we know is really hard to fix when you have issues with it.

514
00:50:43,418 --> 00:50:48,420
[SPEAKER_16]: So this product is a beautiful product, so I applaud Ms.

515
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:52,442
[SPEAKER_16]: Rodriguez for bringing this product to our attention, because just look at it.

516
00:50:52,622 --> 00:50:58,265
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, it is a beautiful product, and hopefully this will be the first school that has this product used.

517
00:50:58,906 --> 00:51:03,108
[SPEAKER_16]: And more of them will be transferred into this in the near future.

518
00:51:03,668 --> 00:51:07,950
[SPEAKER_16]: But this certainly will be a milestone, I think, for the new schools.

519
00:51:08,570 --> 00:51:11,111
[SPEAKER_16]: So thank you very much, Christine, for laying out that timeline.

520
00:51:11,131 --> 00:51:14,612
[SPEAKER_16]: And thank you, Laughlin, as well, for all of your hard work over the summer.

521
00:51:14,652 --> 00:51:15,232
[SPEAKER_16]: We appreciate it.

522
00:51:15,252 --> 00:51:16,533
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

523
00:51:16,553 --> 00:51:16,593
[SPEAKER_16]: Ms.

524
00:51:16,613 --> 00:51:16,973
[SPEAKER_16]: Vandekloot.

525
00:51:19,833 --> 00:51:20,994
[SPEAKER_19]: You gave us two samples.

526
00:51:21,774 --> 00:51:24,615
[SPEAKER_19]: One was black topped and the other one was a sandy color.

527
00:51:24,755 --> 00:51:25,955
[SPEAKER_19]: Which one will be used?

528
00:51:26,155 --> 00:51:26,696
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, the box.

529
00:51:26,716 --> 00:51:28,296
[SPEAKER_16]: We have other options.

530
00:51:28,696 --> 00:51:30,657
[SPEAKER_08]: We do have color samples.

531
00:51:30,717 --> 00:51:37,939
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe that we were looking for a green, a more neutral color that would be blending in.

532
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,940
[SPEAKER_19]: I was just concerned about the black top.

533
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:44,782
[SPEAKER_08]: No, this is just more material sample as opposed to color sample.

534
00:51:44,922 --> 00:51:47,223
[SPEAKER_08]: There are many color samples available.

535
00:51:47,723 --> 00:51:47,983
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

536
00:51:51,048 --> 00:51:51,328
[SPEAKER_16]: Ms.

537
00:51:51,828 --> 00:51:52,368
[SPEAKER_16]: DiBenedetto.

538
00:51:53,028 --> 00:51:53,389
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

539
00:51:53,869 --> 00:51:59,610
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd actually like to give the floor to Cheryl before I speak.

540
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:15,173
[SPEAKER_15]: I attended a lot of the CPA, CPC meetings with her to support her through this whole thing, but since she's the originator, I yield to her and to what she wants to present and why the amount was $109,000 to begin with and how we've

541
00:52:18,075 --> 00:52:20,396
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, just open the conversation up.

542
00:52:20,416 --> 00:52:23,297
[SPEAKER_16]: Certainly, if you two could just stay to the left.

543
00:52:23,397 --> 00:52:47,328
[SPEAKER_15]: Before I do that, I'd just like to acknowledge that we have a city councillor in the room, Brianna Mwango-Cohen, and she's also here, and she's also been a strong supporter of this program and many other school programs, so I just wanna acknowledge that she is in the audience, and maybe she can, at some point, if we do need to expedite things, help us in that manner if she sees fit.

544
00:52:47,977 --> 00:52:49,718
[SPEAKER_16]: Name and address, please, for our record.

545
00:52:51,879 --> 00:52:53,859
[SPEAKER_17]: Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park Street.

546
00:52:53,879 --> 00:52:57,761
[SPEAKER_17]: I actually have a handout to go with the materials that I'll be discussing.

547
00:53:02,883 --> 00:53:07,265
[SPEAKER_17]: So I am a parent volunteer at the Roberts Elementary School.

548
00:53:07,285 --> 00:53:09,086
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not employed by the city of Medford.

549
00:53:09,386 --> 00:53:14,148
[SPEAKER_17]: I submitted this grant application on behalf of the Roberts PTO.

550
00:53:15,058 --> 00:53:19,520
[SPEAKER_17]: for benefit of the nearly 600 children that attend the Roberts Elementary School.

551
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:24,321
[SPEAKER_17]: We're home to the Autism Inclusion Program as well as the ELL Welcome Center.

552
00:53:24,361 --> 00:53:26,882
[SPEAKER_17]: We are the largest elementary school in the city of Medford.

553
00:53:29,223 --> 00:53:33,145
[SPEAKER_17]: So, Kirsten did begin a little bit on our timeline and

554
00:53:40,094 --> 00:53:50,240
[SPEAKER_17]: I definitely went through a lot of processes to get to this estimate and attended a lot of meetings and spoke to several playground vendors.

555
00:53:50,820 --> 00:54:04,288
[SPEAKER_17]: When I heard on the last two days that the bids had come in—this is very loud—double, triple, quadruple, I was very concerned about the predatory nature of this bidding process.

556
00:54:04,997 --> 00:54:12,380
[SPEAKER_17]: And I called the Attorney General for assistance to find out why this was happening, what our alternatives were.

557
00:54:12,921 --> 00:54:28,407
[SPEAKER_17]: Because my conversations with the several vendors that specialize in this playground equipment led me to wonder why we weren't using the Massachusetts Operational Service Division statewide contracts.

558
00:54:29,348 --> 00:54:34,050
[SPEAKER_17]: I was continuously told by the city that the reason we were not using them was because

559
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:36,880
[SPEAKER_17]: we couldn't spend more than $50,000 to do so.

560
00:54:36,941 --> 00:54:44,202
[SPEAKER_17]: But I was continuously told by the people who do this work that that was not the case.

561
00:54:45,362 --> 00:54:54,004
[SPEAKER_17]: So today I deep dove into it and spoke to someone at the Attorney's General's Office whose information I'm willing to provide to the city so that you can verify.

562
00:54:54,024 --> 00:55:02,926
[SPEAKER_17]: And they told me that in 2016, the Chapter 30B procurement laws were altered.

563
00:55:04,158 --> 00:55:08,560
[SPEAKER_17]: And the alteration meant that it's not a $50,000 cap on materials.

564
00:55:08,620 --> 00:55:10,961
[SPEAKER_17]: The material purchase is unlimited.

565
00:55:10,981 --> 00:55:12,742
[SPEAKER_17]: Let me say that again.

566
00:55:12,762 --> 00:55:15,343
[SPEAKER_17]: The material purchase is unlimited for this.

567
00:55:16,203 --> 00:55:20,845
[SPEAKER_17]: The labor costs prior to 2016 were capped at $10,000.

568
00:55:21,305 --> 00:55:24,366
[SPEAKER_17]: The labor costs for this project now are capped at $50,000.

569
00:55:26,558 --> 00:55:27,878
[SPEAKER_17]: So I found that very interesting.

570
00:55:28,338 --> 00:55:35,160
[SPEAKER_17]: I reached out to a vendor that the Medford Public Schools has used before, the same vendor that I used to create my application.

571
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:44,161
[SPEAKER_17]: If you turn to the last page of my handout, I have the itemized budget that was presented to the CPC.

572
00:55:45,581 --> 00:55:51,802
[SPEAKER_17]: If you'll note the bottom line before the total, it says installation and rubber interlocking tiles, $87,540.

573
00:55:55,749 --> 00:56:08,221
[SPEAKER_17]: This estimate was for the 5,876 square foot playground at the Roberts Elementary School with rubber interlocking tile with a six foot fall height.

574
00:56:10,283 --> 00:56:13,246
[SPEAKER_17]: So I reached to that vendor and said, we have an urgent issue.

575
00:56:13,326 --> 00:56:19,992
[SPEAKER_17]: Our city is being told that they have to spend triple or quadruple the price that you gave me in February.

576
00:56:20,032 --> 00:56:20,592
[SPEAKER_17]: What happened?

577
00:56:21,824 --> 00:56:23,405
[SPEAKER_17]: and he rushed me out an estimate.

578
00:56:24,025 --> 00:56:27,007
[SPEAKER_17]: In his estimate, he included extra square footage.

579
00:56:27,067 --> 00:56:30,929
[SPEAKER_17]: The square footage that he included was 6,096 square feet.

580
00:56:32,830 --> 00:56:39,254
[SPEAKER_17]: He included the installation and the materials cost at $89,681.

581
00:56:39,294 --> 00:56:40,275
[SPEAKER_17]: The copy machine broke.

582
00:56:40,315 --> 00:56:41,615
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't have copies for everyone.

583
00:56:41,655 --> 00:56:46,198
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm happy to email, and I do have one extra copy that can be passed around.

584
00:56:48,026 --> 00:56:54,970
[SPEAKER_17]: As I told the CPC when I presented my original bid, the labor cost for this project will be no more than 25% of that total price.

585
00:56:54,990 --> 00:56:57,131
[SPEAKER_17]: No more than 25% of that total price is approximately $22,000.

586
00:56:57,191 --> 00:57:00,753
[SPEAKER_17]: $22,000 is $28,000 below the $50,000 labor threshold that would allow us to bypass the open bid process that has not attracted the proper people.

587
00:57:17,268 --> 00:57:19,989
[SPEAKER_17]: So I have the information.

588
00:57:20,369 --> 00:57:21,549
[SPEAKER_17]: We can use the FAC 104.

589
00:57:22,910 --> 00:57:34,473
[SPEAKER_17]: This information is confirmed by the Attorney General's Office, the Operational Service Division, as well as DCAM, which stands for Division of Capital Asset Management and Maintenance.

590
00:57:35,354 --> 00:57:40,275
[SPEAKER_17]: I spent more than an hour and a half on the phone today with Brian O'Donnell at the Attorney General's Office.

591
00:57:41,216 --> 00:57:45,557
[SPEAKER_17]: This process ensures that the labor

592
00:57:47,414 --> 00:57:55,480
[SPEAKER_17]: requirements are met, the fair wage is paid, everything that's required under Chapter 30B is protected here.

593
00:57:56,661 --> 00:58:08,829
[SPEAKER_17]: I beg you, before you go and ask for more money from the CPC to verify this information, I'm told that we can accept this bid and move forward.

594
00:58:09,190 --> 00:58:10,711
[SPEAKER_17]: We can get the full estimate

595
00:58:11,251 --> 00:58:12,192
[SPEAKER_17]: and move forward.

596
00:58:12,492 --> 00:58:22,640
[SPEAKER_17]: We don't have to ask for additional funds, we don't have to wait an additional month, and if there are more CPC funds for an additional hundred or so thousand dollars, I encourage you to do another playground.

597
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:25,322
[SPEAKER_17]: I encourage you to do something else for the school department.

598
00:58:25,862 --> 00:58:28,164
[SPEAKER_17]: I discourage you from paying

599
00:58:28,844 --> 00:58:31,966
[SPEAKER_17]: more than double the cost of this project to expedite it.

600
00:58:32,247 --> 00:58:39,312
[SPEAKER_17]: Those children deserve this project and I want them to have this project, but I do not want it to come at the cost of one single child in this city.

601
00:58:40,132 --> 00:58:49,119
[SPEAKER_17]: I tried to meet with people in this city to discuss this before this meeting because I do not enjoy coming down to City Hall and

602
00:58:49,973 --> 00:58:55,575
[SPEAKER_17]: And having to say this, I would have preferred to have come here tonight and said, thank you for getting this project underway.

603
00:58:56,015 --> 00:58:58,816
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for having this happen as quickly as possible.

604
00:58:59,736 --> 00:59:04,538
[SPEAKER_17]: I just, someone please schedule a meeting with me and I will share more of this information.

605
00:59:05,498 --> 00:59:08,079
[SPEAKER_17]: But please don't spend more money than we need to on this project.

606
00:59:09,099 --> 00:59:09,440
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

607
00:59:09,740 --> 00:59:09,940
[SPEAKER_16]: Ms.

608
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:10,320
[SPEAKER_16]: Patterson?

609
00:59:14,526 --> 00:59:23,269
[SPEAKER_08]: So again, working with City Hall, the City Procurement, and the OIG's office, we have gone through separate procurement options as well.

610
00:59:23,769 --> 00:59:25,350
[SPEAKER_08]: This was an open bid process.

611
00:59:26,070 --> 00:59:34,473
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess I would be remiss in wondering why this particular bidder did not engage in that process, given there were two different rounds.

612
00:59:34,974 --> 00:59:43,917
[SPEAKER_08]: If the scope of their project is so low in cost, they would have certainly been the low bidder in this particular open public

613
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:45,288
[SPEAKER_08]: of the bidding process.

614
00:59:45,868 --> 00:59:51,812
[SPEAKER_08]: My concern is that prevailing wage rates are not incorporated in this particular case.

615
00:59:51,932 --> 01:00:11,444
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are separately requested and provided within that scope and area, as well as the actual material subsidy and making sure that it's of the rating that is identified for fall ratings at different heights within the playground structures.

616
01:00:11,844 --> 01:00:12,605
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're certainly

617
01:00:13,997 --> 01:00:17,799
[SPEAKER_08]: Working with city procurement, happy to reach out again.

618
01:00:17,819 --> 01:00:36,191
[SPEAKER_08]: I am just concerned for continuing to exhaust different outlets and further delaying the process given that we have gone through the procurement as required by Mass General Law.

619
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:43,055
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have gone through every exercise required of Mass General Law in accordance with that.

620
01:00:43,707 --> 01:00:49,530
[SPEAKER_08]: Certainly, we can reach out to DCAM, but this is really a different scope.

621
01:00:49,590 --> 01:00:55,293
[SPEAKER_08]: So with the quotes coming in under $100,000, that would have been a different scenario.

622
01:00:55,353 --> 01:01:12,721
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would be concerned in terms of how it was quoted, how the information was brought forward by one particular vendor, rather than being part of the open bid process and submitting their formal bid in that same capacity if all of the components were of the same nature, prevailing wage,

623
01:01:13,302 --> 01:01:14,863
[SPEAKER_08]: and so on and so forth.

624
01:01:15,223 --> 01:01:25,528
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would just indicate that, yes, we're certainly open to reviewing this with city procurement and going forward in that regard.

625
01:01:25,548 --> 01:01:26,988
[SPEAKER_16]: I did want to just mention one thing.

626
01:01:27,008 --> 01:01:37,493
[SPEAKER_16]: Chief Procurement Officer Shabkan, she actually consulted with, I think, five of the vendors that are on the state list, and she's waiting to get some quotes back to see what the actual product cost is.

627
01:01:37,927 --> 01:01:44,490
[SPEAKER_16]: Of course, that doesn't include everything that goes under that because it's far more than just those blocks.

628
01:01:44,890 --> 01:01:52,294
[SPEAKER_16]: There's a lot of work that goes under it from a drainage perspective, other materials such as crushed peat and whatnot.

629
01:01:53,314 --> 01:01:54,635
[SPEAKER_16]: A lot of different things go under that.

630
01:01:55,193 --> 01:02:01,618
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're getting a cost on just the blocks, and then we have to determine all the rest of the pieces that go into it.

631
01:02:02,319 --> 01:02:08,925
[SPEAKER_16]: And certainly if it was something our guys could do, we could buy the blocks and put them in, but we'd have no warranty on the work product.

632
01:02:08,965 --> 01:02:11,727
[SPEAKER_16]: We need a professional to really do it and do it right.

633
01:02:11,907 --> 01:02:16,991
[SPEAKER_16]: But we have started that process to try and actually get dollar amounts for what the product is.

634
01:02:17,672 --> 01:02:22,496
[SPEAKER_08]: Mayor Burke, if I may follow up, the additional piece was a concern for

635
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:35,607
[SPEAKER_08]: the perception of bid splitting because there are so many components to this project and not being fair in the terms of procurement and issuing a fair open bid in context.

636
01:02:36,827 --> 01:02:50,274
[SPEAKER_08]: Most of these large scope projects have all of the components together where one vendor is providing all of the service, which includes providing the material, installing it as well.

637
01:02:50,414 --> 01:02:51,515
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's the

638
01:02:52,268 --> 01:03:01,636
[SPEAKER_08]: perception or could have been a bid protest if we determined to do separate bids for certain things and we did not do the actual installation.

639
01:03:01,957 --> 01:03:02,337
[SPEAKER_08]: Correct.

640
01:03:02,357 --> 01:03:03,858
[SPEAKER_08]: We have no warranty in that context.

641
01:03:06,109 --> 01:03:07,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this is a question for Cheryl.

642
01:03:08,090 --> 01:03:13,274
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just curious, so this bid was submitted to you on the 6th, is that correct?

643
01:03:13,555 --> 01:03:14,475
[SPEAKER_03]: I received it today.

644
01:03:15,056 --> 01:03:23,082
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just curious, like, why didn't they... Well, I do have an answer for that question of why they did not submit the bid.

645
01:03:24,255 --> 01:03:46,348
[SPEAKER_17]: When we initially discussed the bids and when I discussed with this vendor and before we applied with the CPC, he said that typically they prefer a landscaper or another company to do the removal because it's they don't want to send certified professional playground installation people to come out with a shovel and remove and they'll charge us much more for that.

646
01:03:46,748 --> 01:03:47,569
[SPEAKER_17]: They said that they

647
01:03:47,976 --> 01:03:54,261
[SPEAKER_17]: that depending on the specialist you get, they can charge you $30,000, $50,000 for the removal because they really don't want to do it.

648
01:03:54,882 --> 01:03:59,205
[SPEAKER_17]: And one of the things that the CPC requested that I do was bring the bid down.

649
01:03:59,966 --> 01:04:08,533
[SPEAKER_17]: So when I submitted the original price, it had with the specialist removing the product, the original product, and it was higher.

650
01:04:08,993 --> 01:04:12,236
[SPEAKER_17]: So by going with a landscaper, it will be less expensive.

651
01:04:12,667 --> 01:04:19,614
[SPEAKER_17]: And he said when he saw the first bid that the bid was unattractive to his company because it included the removal.

652
01:04:19,974 --> 01:04:21,296
[SPEAKER_17]: He did not see the second one.

653
01:04:22,056 --> 01:04:26,521
[SPEAKER_16]: If I could just interject, Christine, the second round of the bids, you did take out some of the work.

654
01:04:26,581 --> 01:04:28,543
[SPEAKER_16]: What work did you remove from the second bid?

655
01:04:33,109 --> 01:04:42,831
[SPEAKER_08]: removing the existing material and grading it down in order for preparation of the installer and special subgrading of the material.

656
01:04:42,991 --> 01:04:48,593
[SPEAKER_16]: So we did take that piece out in an attempt to get to a better price that was more affordable.

657
01:04:48,833 --> 01:04:52,114
[SPEAKER_17]: And again, he said he didn't see that bid.

658
01:04:52,554 --> 01:04:57,275
[SPEAKER_17]: I did also speak to Fiona in the procurement office before the bid opened, the second bid.

659
01:04:57,675 --> 01:05:02,276
[SPEAKER_17]: And I also spoke to Kirsten at the school because I went to the first contractor walkthrough.

660
01:05:02,636 --> 01:05:06,517
[SPEAKER_17]: where zero contractors came to measure, and I said, what do we do now?

661
01:05:06,878 --> 01:05:08,998
[SPEAKER_17]: It appears that we're not attracting any bids.

662
01:05:09,478 --> 01:05:10,799
[SPEAKER_17]: And she said, we have bids.

663
01:05:10,939 --> 01:05:12,139
[SPEAKER_17]: And I said, oh, we have bids?

664
01:05:12,239 --> 01:05:12,600
[SPEAKER_17]: Great.

665
01:05:13,020 --> 01:05:15,461
[SPEAKER_17]: And then the next week they opened one bid, and it was in excess of $300,000.

666
01:05:15,701 --> 01:05:18,322
[SPEAKER_17]: I said, if now, what do we do?

667
01:05:18,342 --> 01:05:22,563
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, this time we reach out to vendors and try to encourage them to apply.

668
01:05:23,083 --> 01:05:24,944
[SPEAKER_17]: But we have to reach out to playground vendors.

669
01:05:25,294 --> 01:05:28,135
[SPEAKER_17]: Because this is what happens if you reach out to a general contractor.

670
01:05:28,155 --> 01:05:30,736
[SPEAKER_17]: The general contractor says, I'm not certified to do this.

671
01:05:30,776 --> 01:05:31,597
[SPEAKER_17]: You know what I'm going to do?

672
01:05:31,937 --> 01:05:34,918
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to contract a playground specialist to do this.

673
01:05:35,258 --> 01:05:37,319
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm going to contract him to do the entire thing.

674
01:05:37,660 --> 01:05:38,720
[SPEAKER_17]: And he's going to charge me $150,000.

675
01:05:38,940 --> 01:05:41,481
[SPEAKER_17]: But I want to make money, too.

676
01:05:41,781 --> 01:05:42,942
[SPEAKER_17]: So he's going to charge more.

677
01:05:43,382 --> 01:06:04,110
[SPEAKER_17]: And I don't think that chasing this down, this, my suggestion, and chase, which is not my suggestion, it's the suggestion of the Attorney General's office, and saving the city $100,000 while you can concurrently wait to go to the CPC and tell them you need more money, and if you find out that this is indeed factual, because, I'm sorry, but I don't make things up.

678
01:06:04,211 --> 01:06:05,771
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't need to come here and embarrass myself.

679
01:06:06,031 --> 01:06:10,153
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you talk to the lawyer on duty today, or did you talk to the

680
01:06:11,577 --> 01:06:17,259
[SPEAKER_17]: No, I talked to someone in the Attorney General's office that works with the fare wager and the construction.

681
01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:25,804
[SPEAKER_17]: So he said that this Massachusetts contracts follow the prevailing wage laws.

682
01:06:26,164 --> 01:06:28,886
[SPEAKER_16]: You're allowed to purchase the product off the state bid list.

683
01:06:29,226 --> 01:06:32,427
[SPEAKER_17]: You're also allowed to do the bid at labor for less than a month.

684
01:06:32,447 --> 01:06:35,509
[SPEAKER_03]: This vendor is certified to make a bid on the project.

685
01:06:35,855 --> 01:06:36,856
[SPEAKER_16]: They didn't make a bid on either round.

686
01:06:36,876 --> 01:06:38,337
[SPEAKER_03]: But they didn't make a bid on either round.

687
01:06:38,397 --> 01:06:41,519
[SPEAKER_16]: But we do have two playground companies that did bid on the second round.

688
01:06:41,979 --> 01:06:42,239
[SPEAKER_03]: I see.

689
01:06:42,599 --> 01:06:44,841
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it possible we could reopen the bidding process?

690
01:06:45,241 --> 01:06:46,042
[SPEAKER_16]: We don't need to do that.

691
01:06:46,062 --> 01:06:46,682
[SPEAKER_16]: You re-advertise.

692
01:06:46,702 --> 01:06:48,423
[SPEAKER_16]: You go through that whole process again to re-advertise.

693
01:06:48,443 --> 01:06:49,624
[SPEAKER_16]: We have to re-advertise it.

694
01:06:49,664 --> 01:06:51,165
[SPEAKER_16]: Which, I mean, it's a process.

695
01:06:51,245 --> 01:06:54,307
[SPEAKER_16]: But if we could save $100,000, of course we would do it.

696
01:06:54,327 --> 01:06:54,427
[SPEAKER_16]: Right.

697
01:06:54,487 --> 01:07:02,012
[SPEAKER_17]: Or we could just go through the MAS contracts, the contract user guide for the FAC 104, which I'm more than willing to share with you.

698
01:07:03,553 --> 01:07:04,474
[SPEAKER_17]: learn how to do it.

699
01:07:05,314 --> 01:07:06,335
[SPEAKER_16]: We've done it before.

700
01:07:06,835 --> 01:07:07,896
[SPEAKER_16]: They do know how to do it.

701
01:07:07,916 --> 01:07:09,177
[SPEAKER_17]: So you can do the mass contracts.

702
01:07:09,217 --> 01:07:10,557
[SPEAKER_17]: You do not have to open the bid.

703
01:07:10,617 --> 01:07:11,918
[SPEAKER_17]: The labor cost is less than $50,000.

704
01:07:12,198 --> 01:07:14,440
[SPEAKER_17]: You do not have to open a bid.

705
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:16,401
[SPEAKER_17]: You can go through the mass contracts.

706
01:07:17,755 --> 01:07:19,436
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Benedetto, point of information.

707
01:07:19,696 --> 01:07:20,056
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

708
01:07:20,957 --> 01:07:26,399
[SPEAKER_15]: At the beginning, the CPA was very careful about what they were awarding and exactly how much money.

709
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:42,127
[SPEAKER_15]: And the quotes, the amount of money presented to the CPA was based on a quote that Cheryl had from the same company to do it, because they wanted us to keep the price down.

710
01:07:42,187 --> 01:07:46,790
[SPEAKER_15]: They didn't want to spend $200,000 for this project or allocate that money.

711
01:07:46,810 --> 01:07:47,510
[SPEAKER_16]: Point of information.

712
01:07:47,957 --> 01:08:05,976
[SPEAKER_15]: So my point is that I don't know going back to them, asking them for more money on this project is going to work from what I've seen and what I, I stood there with Cheryl and answered their questions and they were very cautious about how much money they were giving us towards this ground coverage.

713
01:08:06,077 --> 01:08:08,659
[SPEAKER_15]: And this was told to us that it was a one time thing.

714
01:08:08,900 --> 01:08:10,261
[SPEAKER_15]: They weren't going to do all the schools.

715
01:08:10,605 --> 01:08:12,547
[SPEAKER_15]: And they wanted the square products.

716
01:08:12,587 --> 01:08:15,089
[SPEAKER_15]: They were specific about what products we had to use.

717
01:08:15,129 --> 01:08:18,793
[SPEAKER_15]: They were specific about how much they were going to allocate to us.

718
01:08:19,113 --> 01:08:25,620
[SPEAKER_15]: So even my concern is going through this whole process through October might not get us the extra money from them.

719
01:08:26,621 --> 01:08:27,702
[SPEAKER_15]: And then where are we?

720
01:08:29,666 --> 01:08:42,793
[SPEAKER_15]: Initially, I believe, John gave some of the names of contractors to get quotes to Cheryl, and that's the companies that she's presenting those figures to you now.

721
01:08:43,114 --> 01:08:45,775
[SPEAKER_15]: So it wasn't like she went out and got them aimlessly.

722
01:08:46,095 --> 01:08:49,537
[SPEAKER_15]: The school— No, no, I'm just filling in that blank.

723
01:08:49,637 --> 01:08:55,060
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not like she went off to a company that we have no known knowledge.

724
01:08:57,262 --> 01:08:57,882
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Ruggiero.

725
01:08:58,678 --> 01:09:00,119
[SPEAKER_03]: I think everyone here is on the same side.

726
01:09:00,279 --> 01:09:03,560
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, we all want to save $100,000 and have a beautiful playground.

727
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:05,181
[SPEAKER_03]: My question is this.

728
01:09:05,581 --> 01:09:09,022
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess I'm trying to understand why they didn't bid the second round.

729
01:09:09,362 --> 01:09:12,463
[SPEAKER_17]: They said they did not see it come up the second time.

730
01:09:12,644 --> 01:09:13,324
[SPEAKER_17]: I was out of town.

731
01:09:13,364 --> 01:09:15,965
[SPEAKER_17]: I didn't have time to email everyone and tell them about the process.

732
01:09:16,085 --> 01:09:21,347
[SPEAKER_17]: I did actually ask Fiona to send me the information, and I did not receive an email with the information.

733
01:09:22,313 --> 01:09:24,315
[SPEAKER_17]: So this was not on their radar.

734
01:09:24,615 --> 01:09:28,179
[SPEAKER_17]: But in the handout that I gave you, there's also information on the statewide contract.

735
01:09:28,279 --> 01:09:32,163
[SPEAKER_17]: This contract that I'm handing you falls into the category of statewide contracts.

736
01:09:32,523 --> 01:09:34,004
[SPEAKER_17]: Who may use statewide contracts?

737
01:09:34,425 --> 01:09:37,708
[SPEAKER_17]: Cities, towns, district, counties, and other political subdivisions.

738
01:09:38,129 --> 01:09:39,430
[SPEAKER_17]: I believe Medford is a city.

739
01:09:40,531 --> 01:09:41,432
[SPEAKER_17]: Buyer information.

740
01:09:41,492 --> 01:09:42,393
[SPEAKER_17]: Why would you use it?

741
01:09:42,413 --> 01:09:46,717
[SPEAKER_17]: Because it saves time developing solicitations and issuing bids.

742
01:09:47,203 --> 01:09:49,605
[SPEAKER_17]: evaluating responses and executing contracts.

743
01:09:50,226 --> 01:10:00,014
[SPEAKER_17]: The OSD has negotiated the pricing or required competitive costs, selected the appropriate vendors, and outlined the services the vendors perform relative to the contract.

744
01:10:00,454 --> 01:10:04,017
[SPEAKER_17]: They are subject to the Mass General Law, Chapter 30B.

745
01:10:04,398 --> 01:10:06,419
[SPEAKER_17]: They're also subject to the wage requirements.

746
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:08,361
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, that wouldn't include wages.

747
01:10:08,811 --> 01:10:10,212
[SPEAKER_16]: the list would just be the product.

748
01:10:10,572 --> 01:10:13,854
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's just that product, not all the underlayment that goes with it.

749
01:10:14,355 --> 01:10:15,555
[SPEAKER_16]: So there's more than that.

750
01:10:15,736 --> 01:10:19,378
[SPEAKER_17]: The included in there is $3,000 for a rubber membrane underneath.

751
01:10:19,858 --> 01:10:29,465
[SPEAKER_17]: The application that we submitted to the CPC also has $10,000 if we have to repair and touch up the substone.

752
01:10:29,825 --> 01:10:34,468
[SPEAKER_17]: It also includes $12,000 for removal and disposal of rubber surfacing.

753
01:10:34,908 --> 01:10:36,990
[SPEAKER_17]: As I said, that estimate includes labor.

754
01:10:37,730 --> 01:10:41,131
[SPEAKER_17]: The labor is approximately 25% of that overall cost.

755
01:10:41,511 --> 01:10:46,073
[SPEAKER_17]: This is not the only vendor that I've spoken to, and we got an approximate pricing for this playground.

756
01:10:47,373 --> 01:10:50,334
[SPEAKER_03]: How many vendors gave you this ballpark figure?

757
01:10:50,834 --> 01:10:53,335
[SPEAKER_17]: I attended the PTO Expo.

758
01:10:53,395 --> 01:10:54,836
[SPEAKER_17]: I spoke to two vendors there.

759
01:10:54,896 --> 01:10:57,477
[SPEAKER_17]: I gave them the square footage because I had it for the application.

760
01:10:57,897 --> 01:10:59,057
[SPEAKER_17]: It was all around the same.

761
01:11:00,058 --> 01:11:02,638
[SPEAKER_17]: They said, of course, we'd have to come out and measure and exact.

762
01:11:02,658 --> 01:11:06,880
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know, is there like a warranty process on this company versus the ones we have?

763
01:11:07,887 --> 01:11:13,210
[SPEAKER_16]: I would imagine it's similar, but I couldn't tell you the exact shipping and the specs.

764
01:11:13,270 --> 01:11:16,211
[SPEAKER_17]: They're registered to FAC 104 company, so they're vetted by the state.

765
01:11:18,332 --> 01:11:20,533
[SPEAKER_17]: They're required to complete the prevailing wage.

766
01:11:20,553 --> 01:11:21,313
[SPEAKER_16]: Are you all set, Mr. Azure?

767
01:11:21,974 --> 01:11:27,416
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, I guess my feeling is I like the idea that we could save $100,000.

768
01:11:27,516 --> 01:11:33,059
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, my concern is I just want to know, is this being done properly?

769
01:11:33,099 --> 01:11:35,960
[SPEAKER_03]: How much time would it take for us to reopen the bidding process?

770
01:11:36,524 --> 01:11:40,807
[SPEAKER_03]: If we had to put, like, let's assume, assume that we do have to open the re-bidding process.

771
01:11:40,827 --> 01:11:41,188
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate that.

772
01:11:41,208 --> 01:11:44,510
[SPEAKER_16]: We've done two bidding processes since middle July, I believe.

773
01:11:45,471 --> 01:11:47,673
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's taken almost two months.

774
01:11:47,693 --> 01:11:50,055
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like a two-month, and we can't install in December.

775
01:11:50,075 --> 01:11:55,700
[SPEAKER_16]: You have to advertise, post the bid, leave it open for a couple weeks, and then do the bid opening.

776
01:11:55,760 --> 01:12:00,183
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's at least a month, I think, if you would speak to our chief procurement officer.

777
01:12:00,524 --> 01:12:00,824
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

778
01:12:00,844 --> 01:12:01,965
[SPEAKER_16]: To do another round.

779
01:12:03,526 --> 01:12:03,646
[SPEAKER_16]: Ms.

780
01:12:03,746 --> 01:12:04,447
[SPEAKER_16]: Vander Kloot's up next.

781
01:12:05,862 --> 01:12:09,945
[SPEAKER_19]: But what I'm understanding is that Mrs. Rodriguez is saying we don't need to do that.

782
01:12:09,985 --> 01:12:11,626
[SPEAKER_19]: We could use the statewide contracts.

783
01:12:11,666 --> 01:12:18,570
[SPEAKER_19]: And I haven't quite figured out the discrepancy between what she's saying and why we would reopen the bid process.

784
01:12:19,310 --> 01:12:22,932
[SPEAKER_16]: I think there's labor charges, which have to be prevailing wage.

785
01:12:23,112 --> 01:12:28,695
[SPEAKER_16]: There's all the under pieces that go with the system that aren't on the state list.

786
01:12:29,236 --> 01:12:31,217
[SPEAKER_16]: The list is for the product, nothing else.

787
01:12:32,075 --> 01:12:32,375
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

788
01:12:33,016 --> 01:12:39,299
[SPEAKER_19]: So would we do the product through the statewide contract?

789
01:12:39,479 --> 01:12:41,480
[SPEAKER_19]: Is there any difference in what we've received?

790
01:12:41,540 --> 01:12:41,921
[SPEAKER_19]: And then?

791
01:12:42,961 --> 01:12:43,121
[SPEAKER_16]: Ms.

792
01:12:43,161 --> 01:12:51,586
[SPEAKER_16]: Kahn is getting quotes for the product so that we can at least evaluate the piece that is, the largest component is those blocks.

793
01:12:51,946 --> 01:12:52,227
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

794
01:12:52,247 --> 01:12:54,208
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're going to have pricing for those blocks.

795
01:12:54,848 --> 01:12:54,968
[SPEAKER_16]: Right.

796
01:12:54,988 --> 01:12:56,569
[SPEAKER_16]: So, you know, this would be no markup.

797
01:12:56,629 --> 01:12:57,850
[SPEAKER_16]: That would be the cost.

798
01:12:58,570 --> 01:13:01,812
[SPEAKER_19]: And then we would, then we would have to bid the labor?

799
01:13:02,168 --> 01:13:04,530
[SPEAKER_16]: We'd have to bid the labor and everything else that goes under it.

800
01:13:05,010 --> 01:13:06,512
[SPEAKER_19]: No, no, no, no.

801
01:13:06,672 --> 01:13:08,213
[SPEAKER_16]: You're assuming it's $25,000.

802
01:13:08,734 --> 01:13:11,016
[SPEAKER_16]: The bids are coming in at $230,000.

803
01:13:11,196 --> 01:13:16,220
[SPEAKER_16]: So if the product alone is like $80,000, there's other costs that are in that $230,000.

804
01:13:16,841 --> 01:13:18,682
[SPEAKER_17]: That $89,000 includes the labor.

805
01:13:19,082 --> 01:13:27,730
[SPEAKER_17]: They do not sell the tiles without the labor because you are required to have a licensed person install the tiles.

806
01:13:27,790 --> 01:13:29,071
[SPEAKER_17]: That's the industry standard.

807
01:13:29,990 --> 01:13:45,002
[SPEAKER_17]: If the labor costs are below $50,000, according to the Mass General Law, Chapter 30B, which was changed in 2016, if the labor cost is under $50,000, you do not have to bid the labor.

808
01:13:45,522 --> 01:13:47,383
[SPEAKER_17]: The labor cost will be under $25,000.

809
01:13:47,964 --> 01:13:51,326
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know if that's the case.

810
01:13:51,587 --> 01:13:54,889
[SPEAKER_17]: I encourage someone to please meet with me.

811
01:13:54,909 --> 01:13:57,071
[SPEAKER_17]: I will provide the name, number,

812
01:13:57,555 --> 01:14:10,324
[SPEAKER_17]: of the person at the Attorney General's office that I spoke to, who was chasing this down, who said that the Chapter 30B requirements require the prevailing wage, which is included in the MAS contract by law.

813
01:14:11,525 --> 01:14:11,965
[SPEAKER_17]: By law.

814
01:14:12,325 --> 01:14:25,134
[SPEAKER_19]: So, Mayor Burke, is it possible, since we all want to resolve this in the best possible way, is there possible that we could ask someone from the procurement office to sit down with Christine, with Mrs. Rodriguez, maybe with yourself,

815
01:14:25,715 --> 01:14:34,363
[SPEAKER_19]: and talk, maybe talk to the, I just don't want to do anything illegal if we're not, you know, because we've already had a bid, so we need to be careful about that.

816
01:14:34,783 --> 01:14:37,606
[SPEAKER_19]: But could we, clearly we can't settle it tonight.

817
01:14:38,066 --> 01:14:41,349
[SPEAKER_19]: Clearly we want this, we want that playground done.

818
01:14:41,369 --> 01:14:45,413
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm extraordinarily disappointed that it wasn't accomplished this summer.

819
01:14:46,253 --> 01:14:49,636
[SPEAKER_19]: So could I make a motion that,

820
01:14:50,694 --> 01:15:07,285
[SPEAKER_19]: the procurement office, Mrs. Rodriguez, Christine Patterson, sit down with this, perhaps have a discussion with the contractor who Mrs. Rodriguez talked with to see if there is a way to move forward on this for a less expensive.

821
01:15:08,425 --> 01:15:09,366
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion on the floor.

822
01:15:09,386 --> 01:15:10,867
[SPEAKER_16]: Name and address, please.

823
01:15:11,327 --> 01:15:12,468
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm yielding to the speaker.

824
01:15:12,948 --> 01:15:14,189
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Christina Gasson.

825
01:15:14,209 --> 01:15:15,010
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm at 101 Forest Street.

826
01:15:15,070 --> 01:15:17,371
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a Roberts BTO member.

827
01:15:18,472 --> 01:15:19,893
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm also an attorney for the state.

828
01:15:20,580 --> 01:15:25,325
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a procurement attorney, so I will give that for full disclosure.

829
01:15:25,405 --> 01:15:29,248
[SPEAKER_01]: My husband, however, does work for the Operational Services Division and Combis.

830
01:15:30,169 --> 01:15:34,794
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just wanted to verify some of the information that Cheryl Rodriguez has given you today.

831
01:15:35,755 --> 01:15:38,177
[SPEAKER_01]: We did look over Chapter 30B today.

832
01:15:38,197 --> 01:15:41,500
[SPEAKER_01]: We spent a good portion of our day taking a look at it.

833
01:15:42,227 --> 01:15:50,776
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems that there is kind of a discrepancy in what different legal minds are thinking about this, and perhaps it is because the procurement laws changed two years ago.

834
01:15:51,717 --> 01:16:01,466
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would just recommend to the city, to the school committee, just to open the lines of communication between the councils that are advising the city council, the school committee,

835
01:16:01,890 --> 01:16:10,417
[SPEAKER_01]: the city solicitors, and of course, the procurement attorneys here, just to make sure that everybody gets on the same page with this respect to what the procurement laws are in the city.

836
01:16:10,917 --> 01:16:15,781
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've heard a lot about the city procurement officers, city procurement officers, and that's great.

837
01:16:15,821 --> 01:16:22,447
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, you have to go through your own city procurement officers, but there are several state resources that are available to the city.

838
01:16:23,287 --> 01:16:27,591
[SPEAKER_01]: Just at OSD, there is one member, and I can give you this contact information if you'd

839
01:16:28,127 --> 01:16:43,619
[SPEAKER_01]: who deals specifically just with municipalities and is there to advise municipalities on compliance with Chapter 30B, and is there to help them with any kind of questions about whether they can go through the statewide contracts or whether they have to use Chapter 30B.

840
01:16:44,019 --> 01:16:45,080
[SPEAKER_01]: And from that perspective,

841
01:16:46,325 --> 01:16:49,506
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, obviously the state would prefer that they do the statewide contracts.

842
01:16:50,426 --> 01:16:51,486
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes the state some money.

843
01:16:52,066 --> 01:16:53,927
[SPEAKER_01]: It defers our taxes at the state level.

844
01:16:54,427 --> 01:16:58,428
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just helps us get in touch with different contractors.

845
01:16:58,568 --> 01:17:00,549
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's vetted for certain specialties.

846
01:17:00,609 --> 01:17:06,570
[SPEAKER_01]: And as Cheryl mentioned, they are specifically one just for playground equipment, resurfacing.

847
01:17:07,370 --> 01:17:10,471
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you have that out there and when you use the statewide contracts,

848
01:17:10,773 --> 01:17:17,755
[SPEAKER_01]: You know for sure that these people are certified, specialized to install the type of equipment and that are there and they have already been vetted.

849
01:17:18,115 --> 01:17:20,516
[SPEAKER_01]: The prevailing wage, they need to meet the prevailing wage.

850
01:17:20,536 --> 01:17:24,177
[SPEAKER_01]: The Attorney General's Fair Wage Division, they demand that.

851
01:17:24,918 --> 01:17:31,220
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is something that, you know, is you can cut out a lot of the work that you have to do and just go through that.

852
01:17:31,940 --> 01:17:34,541
[SPEAKER_01]: I also wanted to make a quick comment about the bidding process.

853
01:17:35,181 --> 01:17:38,342
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if it was determined at one point that,

854
01:17:38,769 --> 01:17:43,591
[SPEAKER_01]: you needed to open up and do the RFP process according to Chapter 30B?

855
01:17:44,271 --> 01:17:44,931
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a question.

856
01:17:44,971 --> 01:17:52,154
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, we do have an opinion from the Attorney's General Office that it only has to be $50,000 more of materials, not for labor.

857
01:17:52,855 --> 01:17:55,476
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would definitely have your counsel take a look at that.

858
01:17:56,923 --> 01:18:01,825
[SPEAKER_01]: But we have an electronic system called Combis, and it's there to handle the bidding process.

859
01:18:02,445 --> 01:18:04,926
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, you know, welcome to the 21st century.

860
01:18:05,967 --> 01:18:07,047
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have to have people come.

861
01:18:07,067 --> 01:18:09,888
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't want to speak for our procurement officer, but she uses it all the time.

862
01:18:09,988 --> 01:18:12,769
[SPEAKER_16]: I understand that.

863
01:18:12,789 --> 01:18:25,234
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a difference between listing a project in Combis and making sure that all vendors that are in the system and that are certified to do this type of work are notified about what type of project it is.

864
01:18:25,615 --> 01:18:26,635
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a click of a button.

865
01:18:27,079 --> 01:18:34,522
[SPEAKER_01]: and you have to press it in order to make sure that the people that are certified to do this type of work are given the notification.

866
01:18:34,542 --> 01:18:38,984
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it can be in combines, but a contractor who does this specialty might be on vacation that week.

867
01:18:39,724 --> 01:18:44,126
[SPEAKER_01]: They might not be able to come into Medford and turn in the envelope.

868
01:18:44,146 --> 01:18:46,107
[SPEAKER_01]: They might be a small staff.

869
01:18:46,127 --> 01:18:46,948
[SPEAKER_01]: They might be out in Worcester.

870
01:18:46,988 --> 01:18:48,068
[SPEAKER_01]: They might be out in Springfield.

871
01:18:49,349 --> 01:18:56,932
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm all for having the lowest bidder do this project, and I'm all for having it be fair to all bidders in the Commonwealth and beyond.

872
01:18:57,891 --> 01:19:01,213
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we have to do is, you know, welcome to the 21st century.

873
01:19:01,593 --> 01:19:04,515
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have Combis do the bidding system for you.

874
01:19:04,635 --> 01:19:15,362
[SPEAKER_01]: You can, instead of having the procurement officers and witnesses opening a bid with an envelope, you can have them open the emails and the system and say, okay, here's the lowest bid.

875
01:19:15,522 --> 01:19:17,283
[SPEAKER_01]: Congratulations, you win on a certain date.

876
01:19:17,763 --> 01:19:26,068
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would just, in closing, recommend that, you know, all the counsel that are involved with this project, all the procurement officers that are involved with this project,

877
01:19:26,608 --> 01:19:32,271
[SPEAKER_01]: Just open up the lines of communications with both the PTO, the Roberts staff, and everybody.

878
01:19:32,311 --> 01:19:34,152
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to get this done as soon as possible.

879
01:19:34,432 --> 01:19:37,293
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want to have to cost the taxpayers.

880
01:19:37,313 --> 01:19:41,395
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want to have to go into the CPA for more money if we don't have to do it.

881
01:19:42,155 --> 01:19:45,237
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're looking at children that have returned to school.

882
01:19:45,810 --> 01:19:50,073
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's playground resurfacing that are the size of potholes that you could sit in.

883
01:19:50,894 --> 01:19:52,295
[SPEAKER_01]: This is something that's serious.

884
01:19:52,375 --> 01:19:53,256
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a safety issue.

885
01:19:53,296 --> 01:19:57,039
[SPEAKER_01]: We want it expedited, but we want to make sure that it's fair to all the students in Medford.

886
01:19:57,439 --> 01:20:00,161
[SPEAKER_01]: And we want to make sure that it's fair to the Medford taxpayers as well.

887
01:20:00,361 --> 01:20:00,801
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.

888
01:20:00,821 --> 01:20:01,462
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much.

889
01:20:01,782 --> 01:20:02,122
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

890
01:20:02,283 --> 01:20:02,723
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Ms.

891
01:20:02,743 --> 01:20:03,564
[SPEAKER_16]: Rodriguez, as well.

892
01:20:04,184 --> 01:20:05,225
[SPEAKER_16]: Christine, any closing?

893
01:20:05,649 --> 01:20:12,833
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, just in closing, we were required to list in Combis, which we did, as well as goods and services.

894
01:20:13,154 --> 01:20:19,898
[SPEAKER_08]: Contract was valued at more than $100,000 initially, so we did go through all of those particular outlets.

895
01:20:20,438 --> 01:20:22,840
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, not opposed to revisiting this.

896
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:26,002
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, we are working with our city procurement officer as well.

897
01:20:28,512 --> 01:20:39,517
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, I've made a motion that we have people sit down and talk to each other, including Mrs. Rodriguez, so that people are at the same table because questions have been raised.

898
01:20:40,018 --> 01:20:43,119
[SPEAKER_19]: It's very difficult for us right here to be able to figure it out.

899
01:20:43,980 --> 01:20:50,323
[SPEAKER_19]: And so since there are discussions and everybody wants the same thing, we all want the same thing on this.

900
01:20:51,223 --> 01:20:55,025
[SPEAKER_19]: So I would ask my colleagues to second and vote on my motion.

901
01:20:56,251 --> 01:20:57,751
[SPEAKER_16]: There's a motion to convene a meeting.

902
01:20:58,131 --> 01:21:00,012
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Ruggiero, a question before the roll.

903
01:21:00,112 --> 01:21:09,634
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a friendly amendment that we have someone, whether it's either Howard or Mark Romley, some legal representation, because it seems like there are legal questions in play here.

904
01:21:09,674 --> 01:21:11,394
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.

905
01:21:11,714 --> 01:21:12,015
[SPEAKER_19]: Certainly.

906
01:21:12,375 --> 01:21:14,135
[SPEAKER_19]: I said anybody who's germane to the process.

907
01:21:14,155 --> 01:21:17,876
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to make sure that we have a legal representative at this meeting to make sure everything is clear.

908
01:21:19,376 --> 01:21:19,476
[SPEAKER_16]: Ms.

909
01:21:19,556 --> 01:21:20,196
[SPEAKER_16]: Smith-Stone.

910
01:21:21,257 --> 01:21:21,377
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

911
01:21:23,543 --> 01:21:27,886
[SPEAKER_18]: unclear of the two different processes that are happening.

912
01:21:28,286 --> 01:21:30,207
[SPEAKER_18]: Cheryl, do you mind coming up again?

913
01:21:30,407 --> 01:21:30,907
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sorry.

914
01:21:31,948 --> 01:21:38,371
[SPEAKER_18]: I think there was just so much information that was just given.

915
01:21:38,391 --> 01:21:42,774
[SPEAKER_18]: I feel like I just learned how to be a procurement officer.

916
01:21:45,228 --> 01:21:46,870
[SPEAKER_18]: you had said you had a solution.

917
01:21:47,130 --> 01:21:48,912
[SPEAKER_18]: So can you walk it through?

918
01:21:48,932 --> 01:21:59,225
[SPEAKER_18]: The landscaping is one thing with removal and disposal and the purchase of the playground blocks, interlocking blocks is a different.

919
01:22:01,408 --> 01:22:03,029
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, that was always the plan.

920
01:22:03,530 --> 01:22:09,054
[SPEAKER_18]: So what would you, I'm saying if you, if you say this is right, what would you have us like, how would it start?

921
01:22:09,335 --> 01:22:16,661
[SPEAKER_17]: If I was going to do it tomorrow, I would sit down with John McLaughlin and I would say, um, I remember that you said ground masters could do the removal.

922
01:22:17,521 --> 01:22:19,703
[SPEAKER_17]: So we want to get them lined up to do the removal.

923
01:22:20,144 --> 01:22:24,607
[SPEAKER_17]: We also want to reach back out to, to this company that you've worked with before.

924
01:22:24,767 --> 01:22:27,029
[SPEAKER_17]: And we want to get the itemized bid.

925
01:22:27,069 --> 01:22:30,232
[SPEAKER_17]: We want it to be all laid out with the cost of the tiles.

926
01:22:30,568 --> 01:22:32,009
[SPEAKER_17]: the cost of the installation.

927
01:22:32,349 --> 01:22:34,491
[SPEAKER_17]: We want to know exactly how many days it's going to take.

928
01:22:34,511 --> 01:22:35,832
[SPEAKER_17]: We want to know how long it's going to take.

929
01:22:35,932 --> 01:22:40,875
[SPEAKER_18]: So the RFP, there still needs to be an RFP because it's over $50,000 in product.

930
01:22:41,516 --> 01:22:41,696
[SPEAKER_18]: No.

931
01:22:41,956 --> 01:22:42,096
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

932
01:22:42,276 --> 01:22:42,496
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

933
01:22:42,676 --> 01:22:46,399
[SPEAKER_16]: She's suggesting go through the state contract list, which is already a list established.

934
01:22:46,459 --> 01:22:47,600
[SPEAKER_16]: And you don't need an RFP.

935
01:22:47,640 --> 01:22:48,681
[SPEAKER_18]: We don't need an RFP.

936
01:22:49,221 --> 01:22:50,982
[SPEAKER_18]: And that person is a state contract?

937
01:22:51,382 --> 01:22:51,643
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

938
01:22:52,223 --> 01:22:52,523
[SPEAKER_18]: OK.

939
01:22:52,623 --> 01:22:53,444
[SPEAKER_18]: And then what happens?

940
01:22:54,505 --> 01:22:57,347
[SPEAKER_17]: So then we would execute contracts.

941
01:22:57,427 --> 01:22:58,527
[SPEAKER_17]: We would begin work.

942
01:23:00,238 --> 01:23:14,352
[SPEAKER_17]: get invoiced for the work, and the money is ready to be paid out, we would pay it out, and the children would play on a new playground, and my daughter, who's a fifth grader, would actually get to touch the new playground that we've been trying to get since she started kindergarten.

943
01:23:14,812 --> 01:23:16,974
[SPEAKER_18]: So is the groundmaster still an option?

944
01:23:18,255 --> 01:23:19,997
[SPEAKER_16]: They were going to do the removal.

945
01:23:20,017 --> 01:23:21,198
[SPEAKER_17]: That's who was going to do it anyway.

946
01:23:21,478 --> 01:23:23,500
[SPEAKER_16]: They were going to do the removal of the current product.

947
01:23:27,086 --> 01:23:34,751
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we were planning on using ground masses to come in, take out the surface that's existing there, and grade the surface underneath.

948
01:23:35,111 --> 01:23:43,916
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we were thinking that the company that comes in to lay the tile was going to have to put whatever surface underlayment goes on the tile.

949
01:23:44,616 --> 01:23:45,677
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they would do that.

950
01:23:46,137 --> 01:23:49,059
[SPEAKER_18]: So what the two estimates that came in at 223 and 224?

951
01:23:51,130 --> 01:23:54,071
[SPEAKER_18]: That was not including what Groundmasters was already doing?

952
01:23:54,091 --> 01:23:55,632
[SPEAKER_18]: No, that was the whole thing.

953
01:23:55,652 --> 01:23:58,813
[SPEAKER_16]: No, it was excluding Groundmaster, the removal part.

954
01:23:59,313 --> 01:24:00,894
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, so that was never part of it.

955
01:24:01,194 --> 01:24:04,435
[SPEAKER_18]: So Groundmasters was always on board, that was always the plan?

956
01:24:05,216 --> 01:24:17,801
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the first things we did when we did it the first round is when we found out how much it was gonna cost for the removal of the surface, we decided that we were gonna go out on our own and see how much it would cost us to do it on our own.

957
01:24:18,544 --> 01:24:20,766
[SPEAKER_16]: So if the removal of the first RFP was $100,000, that got removed.

958
01:24:20,846 --> 01:24:23,228
[SPEAKER_16]: And now we're at $225,000, but the actual product only costs $90,000.

959
01:24:23,328 --> 01:24:26,731
[SPEAKER_16]: They were charging $130,000 for installation on these two most recent estimates.

960
01:24:46,303 --> 01:24:48,304
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, so that seems absurd, right?

961
01:24:48,324 --> 01:24:50,746
[SPEAKER_17]: $130,000 to put down into locking blocks.

962
01:24:50,886 --> 01:24:51,446
[SPEAKER_17]: That's absurd.

963
01:24:52,107 --> 01:25:00,833
[SPEAKER_17]: For over $200,000, we could tear out the playground equipment, we could put new playground equipment in tile.

964
01:25:01,873 --> 01:25:06,917
[SPEAKER_18]: So if the $90,000 for this company, Rubble, what was it called?

965
01:25:07,317 --> 01:25:14,302
[SPEAKER_18]: That does not include some underlying, but ground masters can't do that either?

966
01:25:14,322 --> 01:25:15,843
[SPEAKER_17]: No, that does include.

967
01:25:17,985 --> 01:25:26,575
[SPEAKER_18]: So I know ground masters is removal and disposal and we have the product, but then there's some intermediate sod you need or something.

968
01:25:26,615 --> 01:25:27,436
[SPEAKER_13]: Who does that?

969
01:25:28,357 --> 01:25:30,259
[SPEAKER_18]: So can either ground masters do that?

970
01:25:33,247 --> 01:25:36,368
[SPEAKER_02]: This includes... Installing the tiles into that part?

971
01:25:36,408 --> 01:25:36,648
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

972
01:25:37,088 --> 01:25:39,289
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's the hottest part.

973
01:25:39,929 --> 01:25:41,890
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the leveling of the surface and everything.

974
01:25:42,290 --> 01:25:49,993
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we wanted to do is just remove it, grade the underlayment that's existing right there, and then turn it over to the contractor.

975
01:25:50,013 --> 01:25:52,153
[SPEAKER_09]: $3,000 for the rubber membrane.

976
01:25:53,274 --> 01:25:55,034
[SPEAKER_17]: So this bid includes... Okay.

977
01:25:56,135 --> 01:26:02,077
[SPEAKER_17]: This price includes $3,000 for the rubber membrane that would go underneath the tiles.

978
01:26:02,818 --> 01:26:03,418
[SPEAKER_16]: That's just a sheet.

979
01:26:03,959 --> 01:26:06,520
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, so that's included in the $89,000.

980
01:26:06,881 --> 01:26:20,649
[SPEAKER_17]: So if Groundmasters charges $15,000 and we needed $10,000 to replace substone underneath before we put the membrane in the tiles, we would be within $5,000 of the grant amount.

981
01:26:22,610 --> 01:26:23,190
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Russo.

982
01:26:23,871 --> 01:26:28,434
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the questions that member Ms.

983
01:26:28,454 --> 01:26:30,355
[SPEAKER_04]: Stone is asking is exactly why

984
01:26:31,853 --> 01:26:35,535
[SPEAKER_04]: we need everybody to respond to the same bid.

985
01:26:36,295 --> 01:26:44,338
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm trying to get somebody to paint my house, one guy comes out, he's gonna do one coat, the other guy's gonna do two coats, and shockingly, they aren't the same price.

986
01:26:45,178 --> 01:26:46,999
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, what's the warranty?

987
01:26:47,019 --> 01:26:48,200
[SPEAKER_04]: Are the warranties the same?

988
01:26:48,240 --> 01:26:53,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they gonna have one guy who takes six months to install this, or is there gonna be a crew there for two days?

989
01:26:53,982 --> 01:27:00,865
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, the requirements, I'm assuming in the RFP,

990
01:27:01,750 --> 01:27:04,692
[SPEAKER_04]: were not like, do the playground.

991
01:27:04,973 --> 01:27:06,914
[SPEAKER_04]: They were pretty detailed.

992
01:27:07,715 --> 01:27:20,946
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is great, and if we can get this done for half the price or less, I absolutely can find a lot of ways to spend that money, like on air conditioning units.

993
01:27:21,827 --> 01:27:22,588
[SPEAKER_04]: Or another playground.

994
01:27:22,848 --> 01:27:27,752
[SPEAKER_04]: But three lines with a number next to them.

995
01:27:28,893 --> 01:27:34,935
[SPEAKER_04]: is probably like 1,000 times less information than we need to compare.

996
01:27:35,695 --> 01:27:36,035
[SPEAKER_17]: Of course.

997
01:27:36,075 --> 01:27:36,775
[SPEAKER_17]: This is a 24-hour turnaround.

998
01:27:36,795 --> 01:27:37,115
[SPEAKER_17]: Of course.

999
01:27:37,135 --> 01:27:37,635
[SPEAKER_17]: No, no, I know that.

1000
01:27:37,655 --> 01:27:39,456
[SPEAKER_04]: He was just trying to get me something to bring in today.

1001
01:27:39,496 --> 01:27:51,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but I mean, I just think that's why, you know, to be fair, I mean, it has to be an equivalently built-out bid.

1002
01:27:51,999 --> 01:27:56,780
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if we were to say, if they were to say, we can do it for half the price in this meeting that's going to happen,

1003
01:27:57,450 --> 01:28:09,738
[SPEAKER_04]: and everybody agrees that it's perfectly legal, I would hope before we were accepting it, we were gonna have them say, here is the exact details based on the same bid, even if we're not going through the bidding process with the state.

1004
01:28:10,199 --> 01:28:24,088
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanna know that they have really decided to do all this and not like at the end of the day discover, we threw down a plastic membrane instead of the proper stuff that's supposed to go under those, that equipment, so.

1005
01:28:25,078 --> 01:28:25,478
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1006
01:28:25,818 --> 01:28:28,860
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Benedetto.

1007
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:29,880
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1008
01:28:30,340 --> 01:28:44,587
[SPEAKER_15]: So initially when this was presented to the CPA and we were allocated these funds, this was what we had because that's what we needed to have and that was the scope of work we were looking to get done.

1009
01:28:45,507 --> 01:28:49,869
[SPEAKER_15]: So I don't know how it, if it changed and it got more elaborate,

1010
01:28:50,192 --> 01:28:54,539
[SPEAKER_15]: when it went to the bidding process, but this was our pilot program.

1011
01:28:54,880 --> 01:29:02,332
[SPEAKER_15]: This was to see if this stuff worked in our schools before we did the big McGlynn-Andrews

1012
01:29:03,515 --> 01:29:06,218
[SPEAKER_15]: because it's huge, in other schools in the district.

1013
01:29:06,538 --> 01:29:07,639
[SPEAKER_15]: This was piloting it.

1014
01:29:07,979 --> 01:29:13,443
[SPEAKER_15]: We were getting this money not from the school department, but from every taxpayer in this community.

1015
01:29:13,864 --> 01:29:17,206
[SPEAKER_15]: We want to make sure that this is the right product to move forward.

1016
01:29:17,426 --> 01:29:22,470
[SPEAKER_15]: We want to make sure that these children have a chance to run and play in a safe area.

1017
01:29:22,851 --> 01:29:24,512
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe the intent

1018
01:29:24,972 --> 01:29:32,676
[SPEAKER_15]: of this project is awesome and great and we should move forward with what we initially applied for and received.

1019
01:29:33,016 --> 01:29:37,679
[SPEAKER_15]: And if we can do it with the CPA funds and move quickly, I think we should.

1020
01:29:38,019 --> 01:29:52,526
[SPEAKER_15]: And I make a motion to move forward with this project as it was initially brought forward not only to this committee, to the school department, but to the CPA and just move forward for the best interest of the children.

1021
01:29:52,842 --> 01:30:02,149
[SPEAKER_16]: playing in those things, because I would hate for children to get... But we have to rely on our solicitor and chief procurement officer on what we need to do.

1022
01:30:02,630 --> 01:30:05,092
[SPEAKER_16]: So I appreciate all the information that's been given.

1023
01:30:05,772 --> 01:30:09,595
[SPEAKER_16]: We need to rely on their opinions, and that's what will answer this.

1024
01:30:09,655 --> 01:30:11,497
[SPEAKER_15]: So we can do it pending their approval?

1025
01:30:12,517 --> 01:30:17,421
[SPEAKER_16]: This is already moving forward either way, so this isn't really a school committee matter at this point.

1026
01:30:17,461 --> 01:30:21,745
[SPEAKER_16]: It's whether or not it can be done that way, or if we have to go back to the CPC.

1027
01:30:22,842 --> 01:30:23,742
[SPEAKER_16]: is the other question.

1028
01:30:23,802 --> 01:30:25,943
[SPEAKER_16]: So that can all be resolved in the next couple of days.

1029
01:30:26,823 --> 01:30:26,923
[SPEAKER_16]: Ms.

1030
01:30:26,963 --> 01:30:27,364
[SPEAKER_16]: Vander Gloop.

1031
01:30:28,144 --> 01:30:32,705
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, I have a motion though saying let's get... For a meeting, an immediate meeting.

1032
01:30:32,725 --> 01:30:40,668
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, for people around the table to get together because there still is a discrepancy and I still believe it's important for both, for every person.

1033
01:30:40,748 --> 01:30:45,630
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm not casting aspersions any way of saying that someone did the wrong thing or whatever.

1034
01:30:45,650 --> 01:30:48,651
[SPEAKER_19]: RFP has to be very detailed.

1035
01:30:48,691 --> 01:30:51,512
[SPEAKER_19]: I understand that process.

1036
01:30:52,652 --> 01:30:59,955
[SPEAKER_19]: Obviously, Cheryl has invested a great deal of time into this, and we're very grateful to her.

1037
01:31:00,215 --> 01:31:02,015
[SPEAKER_19]: So, let's get people around the table.

1038
01:31:02,636 --> 01:31:04,436
[SPEAKER_19]: We can't solve it tonight.

1039
01:31:05,076 --> 01:31:08,798
[SPEAKER_19]: So, I ask to call my motion, please, and I believe you seconded it.

1040
01:31:09,918 --> 01:31:10,999
[SPEAKER_16]: Would you like to speak on the matter?

1041
01:31:11,299 --> 01:31:14,060
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes, no, I have a question about the motion.

1042
01:31:14,120 --> 01:31:18,542
[SPEAKER_26]: So Paula, is this going to be like a committee of the whole, because we would all want to attend?

1043
01:31:18,562 --> 01:31:23,604
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I think we wanted a meeting of the solicitor, procurement officer, Ms.

1044
01:31:23,644 --> 01:31:25,185
[SPEAKER_16]: Rodriguez, the school department.

1045
01:31:25,205 --> 01:31:26,286
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's not like, it's not?

1046
01:31:26,306 --> 01:31:29,547
[SPEAKER_19]: And Kirsten, who thinks to be there as well?

1047
01:31:30,307 --> 01:31:32,568
[SPEAKER_16]: The professional school, sorry.

1048
01:31:36,565 --> 01:31:37,666
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't have any problem with that.

1049
01:31:37,786 --> 01:31:40,048
[SPEAKER_19]: So, I mean, if we wanted to include a school committee member.

1050
01:31:40,068 --> 01:31:42,791
[SPEAKER_16]: Will you yield to the city councillor to speak, please?

1051
01:31:42,811 --> 01:31:43,011
[SPEAKER_16]: Sure.

1052
01:31:43,071 --> 01:31:43,812
[SPEAKER_23]: Briefly, thank you.

1053
01:31:43,832 --> 01:31:45,173
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm Brianna Lungo-Kern.

1054
01:31:45,213 --> 01:31:53,160
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm also a parent of two children that go to the Roberts and obviously have a lot of people that are here and a lot of people that have called me in the last week.

1055
01:31:53,240 --> 01:31:56,123
[SPEAKER_23]: I think projects have been done in other schools, which is great.

1056
01:31:56,764 --> 01:32:00,847
[SPEAKER_23]: And then you have this project that was, we expected to be completed in August.

1057
01:32:00,907 --> 01:32:02,669
[SPEAKER_23]: And obviously a lot of parents were upset.

1058
01:32:03,185 --> 01:32:06,406
[SPEAKER_23]: And as Christina and Cheryl said, it is a safety issue at this point.

1059
01:32:06,686 --> 01:32:08,927
[SPEAKER_23]: We're worried about our kids when they play on that structure.

1060
01:32:09,448 --> 01:32:12,089
[SPEAKER_23]: And I thank you for the motions you'll be putting forward.

1061
01:32:12,109 --> 01:32:17,651
[SPEAKER_23]: I just also ask that hopefully a meeting be set up like your motion will be next week.

1062
01:32:18,011 --> 01:32:21,493
[SPEAKER_23]: But also in the meantime, research and talk to these vendors.

1063
01:32:21,593 --> 01:32:27,435
[SPEAKER_23]: As Cheryl said, there's three companies that wanted to do it or said it could be done for under $100,000 if we could at the same time research

1064
01:32:30,312 --> 01:32:35,595
[SPEAKER_23]: and talk to these companies, what would an attractive bid be so that we can try to get one of those quotes.

1065
01:32:35,795 --> 01:32:39,196
[SPEAKER_23]: This project could take, I think, the work one week.

1066
01:32:39,677 --> 01:32:45,399
[SPEAKER_23]: So ideally, it would be extremely beneficial for the kids if we could get this done before the winter months.

1067
01:32:45,740 --> 01:32:53,864
[SPEAKER_23]: So if we can pursue not only this meeting with Cheryl, which I'm glad she's going to be in the loop, because I feel like, in a way, she's been left out the last week.

1068
01:32:53,904 --> 01:32:56,585
[SPEAKER_23]: And I think that's one of the things I was a little upset about.

1069
01:32:57,460 --> 01:32:58,501
[SPEAKER_23]: She needs to be involved.

1070
01:32:58,941 --> 01:33:00,942
[SPEAKER_23]: Erin, thank you for all your work on this as well.

1071
01:33:01,462 --> 01:33:23,972
[SPEAKER_23]: But just if we could explore all options, Chapter 30B as well as reaching out, that's something that I think maybe should have been done if it wasn't done months ago, talking to contractors that do this work, not general contractors, but contractors that do this work, figuring out how they would want to bid written and what would be attractive to them so that we could have attracted somebody

1072
01:33:24,900 --> 01:33:27,061
[SPEAKER_23]: like the company that Cheryl has a quote from for 89,000.

1073
01:33:27,481 --> 01:33:39,588
[SPEAKER_23]: So I thank you for your time, and I thank you, and I know that if we work together, we set up a meeting next week, we can get this done before the winter, and I think that's what all the parents are here for, and that's something that we should strive for.

1074
01:33:46,287 --> 01:33:48,088
[SPEAKER_16]: Is there a citizen that would like to speak on this?

1075
01:33:48,729 --> 01:33:49,149
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1076
01:34:12,754 --> 01:34:13,454
[SPEAKER_16]: Mm-hmm, we'll do.

1077
01:34:13,694 --> 01:34:13,994
[SPEAKER_14]: Yep.

1078
01:34:14,294 --> 01:34:14,915
[SPEAKER_16]: Yep, we'll do.

1079
01:34:15,235 --> 01:34:15,635
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1080
01:34:16,135 --> 01:34:17,935
[SPEAKER_16]: On the motion, roll call vote, please.

1081
01:34:19,136 --> 01:34:20,136
[SPEAKER_25]: Mrs. DiBenedetto.

1082
01:34:20,456 --> 01:34:20,676
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1083
01:34:21,156 --> 01:34:21,756
[SPEAKER_25]: Mrs. Kretz.

1084
01:34:21,796 --> 01:34:22,036
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

1085
01:34:22,336 --> 01:34:22,977
[SPEAKER_25]: Mrs. Stone.

1086
01:34:23,817 --> 01:34:23,897
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

1087
01:34:23,937 --> 01:34:24,497
[SPEAKER_25]: Mr. Ruggiero.

1088
01:34:24,517 --> 01:34:24,577
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

1089
01:34:25,317 --> 01:34:25,957
[SPEAKER_25]: Mr. Russo.

1090
01:34:26,998 --> 01:34:27,118
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

1091
01:34:27,138 --> 01:34:27,798
[SPEAKER_25]: Mrs. Vander Kloof.

1092
01:34:27,918 --> 01:34:28,178
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

1093
01:34:28,598 --> 01:34:28,978
[SPEAKER_25]: Mayor Burke.

1094
01:34:29,198 --> 01:34:29,438
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1095
01:34:29,498 --> 01:34:31,079
[SPEAKER_16]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1096
01:34:31,139 --> 01:34:40,621
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion passes, and we will get the parties to be together early next week to discuss this, and also John to do some research, further research.

1097
01:34:41,653 --> 01:34:41,993
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1098
01:34:42,713 --> 01:34:43,474
[SPEAKER_16]: Name and address, please.

1099
01:34:43,534 --> 01:34:43,734
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1100
01:34:43,774 --> 01:34:45,094
[SPEAKER_22]: My name is Ken Krause.

1101
01:34:45,154 --> 01:34:46,814
[SPEAKER_22]: I live at 50 Mystic Street.

1102
01:34:47,135 --> 01:34:48,535
[SPEAKER_22]: Welcome again, Dr. Vincent.

1103
01:34:49,195 --> 01:34:51,016
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm just here as an interested citizen.

1104
01:34:51,076 --> 01:34:59,478
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm not involved with any of the schools, but obviously I feel the schools are very important to the community, both in terms of the curriculum and their

1105
01:34:59,978 --> 01:35:00,798
[SPEAKER_22]: physical appearance.

1106
01:35:00,818 --> 01:35:03,399
[SPEAKER_22]: So on the buildings and grounds report, I just had a question.

1107
01:35:03,859 --> 01:35:09,140
[SPEAKER_22]: I was happy to see that the turf field is moving forward at the Brooks School.

1108
01:35:10,001 --> 01:35:24,404
[SPEAKER_22]: Those of you who've been on the council or the committee for a while, we've been discussing the condition of the field for years, and I'm glad to see it being corrected.

1109
01:35:27,601 --> 01:35:37,767
[SPEAKER_22]: For informational purposes, when I inquired and saw the project going forward, excuse me, I was told that the PTO contributed some money to it as well.

1110
01:35:37,827 --> 01:35:38,667
[SPEAKER_22]: Is that correct?

1111
01:35:38,827 --> 01:35:40,328
[SPEAKER_22]: It wasn't just all the linkage?

1112
01:35:40,348 --> 01:35:47,092
[SPEAKER_22]: So I think it's important that the community knows that the PTO contributed to that.

1113
01:35:47,152 --> 01:35:48,253
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1114
01:35:51,420 --> 01:36:03,011
[SPEAKER_22]: Secondly, I wondered if there is a maintenance budget for the field going forward, because it's a turf field.

1115
01:36:05,145 --> 01:36:09,727
[SPEAKER_22]: like a vacuum or anything that needed to be obtained.

1116
01:36:09,907 --> 01:36:23,391
[SPEAKER_22]: Also if the maintenance and like the infill replenishing is part of the installation contract or the city has to do that and if that's in the budget so the field will be maintained properly.

1117
01:36:26,795 --> 01:36:32,397
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually going to be put on the same maintenance program that the Field of Dreams uses right now.

1118
01:36:32,497 --> 01:36:38,179
[SPEAKER_02]: So when they do the Field of Dreams, they're going to leave there, go down to the Brooks, do the Brooks, the sweeping.

1119
01:36:38,199 --> 01:36:41,800
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's definitely, it's on the same plan.

1120
01:36:43,293 --> 01:36:55,142
[SPEAKER_22]: But I would just add, I think it's appropriate that the linkage money was used because this field is used daily, and it'll be used 365 days a year, and it really was a safety hazard.

1121
01:36:55,182 --> 01:37:03,648
[SPEAKER_22]: It was rutted, it was alternatingly a mud bath or a dust bowl, and it is used by the community year-round.

1122
01:37:04,193 --> 01:37:05,895
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's beyond the school community.

1123
01:37:06,156 --> 01:37:07,958
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a neighborhood.

1124
01:37:08,018 --> 01:37:17,691
[SPEAKER_16]: I happen to have my first home next to the former Davenport School, and that schoolyard, which obviously our old schools didn't have cushion and rubber or anything like that.

1125
01:37:18,264 --> 01:37:19,224
[SPEAKER_16]: That was our playground.

1126
01:37:19,284 --> 01:37:20,845
[SPEAKER_16]: That's where my kids grew up playing.

1127
01:37:20,925 --> 01:37:26,666
[SPEAKER_16]: So we understand how important that is, as are these other schools being used as playgrounds in the after hours.

1128
01:37:26,706 --> 01:37:27,986
[SPEAKER_16]: So thank you for that comment.

1129
01:37:28,006 --> 01:37:29,887
[SPEAKER_22]: And then a final question related to buildings and grounds.

1130
01:37:30,007 --> 01:37:35,168
[SPEAKER_22]: I didn't know if there was an update on the capital work being done by Lesley University.

1131
01:37:35,208 --> 01:37:38,209
[SPEAKER_22]: I saw a photo of the new parquet floor being put in the basketball.

1132
01:37:38,269 --> 01:37:40,109
[SPEAKER_22]: Is there an update on what's happening there?

1133
01:37:40,290 --> 01:37:40,530
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

1134
01:37:40,550 --> 01:37:41,650
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you want to speak to that?

1135
01:37:44,181 --> 01:37:59,337
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Bobby Maloney would probably be better versed to answer the question, but I will say that the parquet floor, they were doing the final sanding today and they're going to be doing the varnish and

1136
01:38:01,838 --> 01:38:05,561
[SPEAKER_16]: And a scoreboard, we're gonna have a scoreboard that will be used for both entities.

1137
01:38:05,981 --> 01:38:09,144
[SPEAKER_16]: There's also a great partnership that's been established.

1138
01:38:09,324 --> 01:38:21,113
[SPEAKER_16]: I know Dr. Maurice is really thrilled with some of the continuing ed programs as well as teacher development that's gonna be part of our Lesley partnership.

1139
01:38:21,153 --> 01:38:22,494
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're really excited about that.

1140
01:38:22,674 --> 01:38:29,239
[SPEAKER_16]: And to have learning labs for their students that also help our kids and our teachers out, win-win.

1141
01:38:31,920 --> 01:38:44,602
[SPEAKER_19]: Could we ask that there be an update about the Leslie project and collaboration, either at our next school committee meeting or the one following that, depending on what's most appropriate?

1142
01:38:44,802 --> 01:38:47,203
[SPEAKER_22]: So I don't have to come back up under community participation.

1143
01:38:47,303 --> 01:38:51,124
[SPEAKER_22]: Could you just tell us what the duration was of the contract that was approved?

1144
01:38:51,204 --> 01:38:56,044
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a three-year contract that has two one-year extension clauses in it.

1145
01:38:56,364 --> 01:38:57,645
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's a three-year contract.

1146
01:38:58,125 --> 01:38:58,365
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1147
01:38:58,745 --> 01:38:59,165
[SPEAKER_16]: You're welcome.

1148
01:39:00,943 --> 01:39:01,703
[SPEAKER_16]: Name and address, please.

1149
01:39:03,604 --> 01:39:06,626
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, Melanie McLaughlin, 152 Alston Street in Medford.

1150
01:39:06,866 --> 01:39:07,986
[SPEAKER_12]: Welcome, Dr. Vincent.

1151
01:39:08,126 --> 01:39:08,907
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for being here.

1152
01:39:09,987 --> 01:39:14,249
[SPEAKER_12]: I wanted to say thank you all for your concern around air conditioning in the high school.

1153
01:39:14,289 --> 01:39:21,432
[SPEAKER_12]: We appreciate the response and the water and the advice to wear light clothing and drink water.

1154
01:39:22,233 --> 01:39:30,076
[SPEAKER_12]: But I do also want to share that I'm sure many of you know that, or I'm sure all of you know that I'm the co-chair of the Special Education Parent Advisory Council in Medford as well.

1155
01:39:30,865 --> 01:39:38,308
[SPEAKER_12]: And we have children with special needs who spend time at the high school, especially over the summer months in the summer fun camp and in the ESY camps and what have you.

1156
01:39:38,368 --> 01:39:40,269
[SPEAKER_12]: And my daughter was among them this summer.

1157
01:39:41,149 --> 01:39:47,192
[SPEAKER_12]: This is something that will include in our PowerPoint presentation soon for Special Education Parent Advisory Council.

1158
01:39:47,212 --> 01:39:58,357
[SPEAKER_12]: But our daughter had to come home several times, especially the last week of the summer fun camp, last two weeks of summer fun camp, because it was just too hot and just unbearable.

1159
01:39:59,954 --> 01:40:03,295
[SPEAKER_12]: we sort of put the information out there because we want to always offer solution.

1160
01:40:04,215 --> 01:40:14,879
[SPEAKER_12]: And so we had asked individuals if maybe there was an air conditioning campaign we could create or there was a fundraising drive we could do or figuring out how we might be able to help with the community.

1161
01:40:14,919 --> 01:40:21,261
[SPEAKER_12]: And we've been getting a mix of information from whether or not window units can be used, whether the windows can accommodate them.

1162
01:40:22,381 --> 01:40:25,642
[SPEAKER_12]: The CPAC donated two years ago a floor unit

1163
01:40:26,607 --> 01:40:34,269
[SPEAKER_12]: to the camp that, last we knew anyway, it had been misplaced for some of the kids that needed it there.

1164
01:40:34,329 --> 01:40:46,753
[SPEAKER_12]: So we've had folks reach out to us from staff, students, teachers, all reach out explaining and sharing their circumstances and their stories that have been very concerning.

1165
01:40:46,813 --> 01:40:52,235
[SPEAKER_12]: Some of whom have talked about migraine headaches, nausea, having to leave the school.

1166
01:40:53,102 --> 01:41:01,925
[SPEAKER_12]: There's been some community conversation around, you know, sort of, well, that's how it's been done all these years, and suck it up and get used to it, and that's our grandfather's school, and what have you.

1167
01:41:01,965 --> 01:41:03,565
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, it's getting hotter over time.

1168
01:41:03,605 --> 01:41:06,326
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, the heat index, I think, yesterday was 103.

1169
01:41:06,366 --> 01:41:14,188
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, I don't know about you guys, but I couldn't bear that, and certainly couldn't ask to be tested.

1170
01:41:14,551 --> 01:41:17,472
[SPEAKER_12]: while I was going through that or asked to be actually learning.

1171
01:41:17,852 --> 01:41:20,053
[SPEAKER_12]: It's basic, you know, Maslow's Heurich of Needs.

1172
01:41:20,093 --> 01:41:24,074
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're not having your basic needs met, you can't do that higher level stuff.

1173
01:41:24,614 --> 01:41:27,775
[SPEAKER_16]: So I would just... If I could just interject for one second.

1174
01:41:27,895 --> 01:41:28,115
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1175
01:41:28,295 --> 01:41:35,577
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Maloney has also looked at some of the summer programs and he's evaluating whether or not they should go out to some of our outlying schools.

1176
01:41:35,617 --> 01:41:37,918
[SPEAKER_16]: Like, it started at the Columbus, some of the programming.

1177
01:41:37,978 --> 01:41:38,178
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

1178
01:41:38,398 --> 01:41:40,719
[SPEAKER_16]: Perhaps get everyone under one roof that has full air conditioning.

1179
01:41:41,416 --> 01:41:54,739
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that's a great approach and that's a good start, but also I know that this is a bigger issue in a multi-million dollar project and what have you for the high school, but I think it's just something that we need to keep circling back to and asking about in terms of safety.

1180
01:41:54,799 --> 01:41:58,599
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you for what's been done so far, but please let's not leave that off the table.

1181
01:41:58,779 --> 01:41:59,300
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1182
01:42:00,020 --> 01:42:01,740
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, ma'am.

1183
01:42:01,760 --> 01:42:02,040
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1184
01:42:02,140 --> 01:42:04,061
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Russo.

1185
01:42:04,081 --> 01:42:05,221
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a question.

1186
01:42:05,801 --> 01:42:10,002
[SPEAKER_04]: Have we heard anything back on our MSBA application?

1187
01:42:10,062 --> 01:42:10,702
[SPEAKER_16]: I believe November.

1188
01:42:11,923 --> 01:42:12,444
[SPEAKER_16]: December.

1189
01:42:15,147 --> 01:42:21,134
[SPEAKER_04]: Arlington, do they release those sort of in dribs and drabs?

1190
01:42:21,274 --> 01:42:23,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Because Arlington's was just approved.

1191
01:42:23,717 --> 01:42:25,640
[SPEAKER_16]: I think Arlington has been, for the high school?

1192
01:42:25,980 --> 01:42:26,501
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1193
01:42:26,521 --> 01:42:28,483
[SPEAKER_16]: I thought they'd been in the queue for a while.

1194
01:42:29,084 --> 01:42:30,005
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, for Arlington High.

1195
01:42:31,484 --> 01:42:33,384
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not like once a year, here you go.

1196
01:42:33,404 --> 01:42:38,165
[SPEAKER_16]: Last year we applied and we were 13th out of the top 10, I believe.

1197
01:42:38,185 --> 01:42:38,506
[SPEAKER_16]: Correct.

1198
01:42:38,646 --> 01:42:44,267
[SPEAKER_16]: So they suggested we reapply with some tweaking, which is what we did for this application.

1199
01:42:44,287 --> 01:42:50,608
[SPEAKER_08]: They were only able to fund 15 projects last year, and we were in the top 40.

1200
01:42:51,128 --> 01:42:58,430
[SPEAKER_08]: So the hope is that they will have additional funding available this year in order to accommodate more projects.

1201
01:42:58,989 --> 01:43:07,434
[SPEAKER_08]: and December 15th was when their final schedule for their board to issue invitations to the feasibility study.

1202
01:43:09,375 --> 01:43:10,956
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, thank you.

1203
01:43:11,676 --> 01:43:13,237
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, Mr. Benedetto.

1204
01:43:13,457 --> 01:43:13,858
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1205
01:43:14,338 --> 01:43:28,326
[SPEAKER_15]: To speak of the air conditioning issue, I had spoken to Dr. Edward Vincent earlier in the week about the possibility of moving the school, the out of school time camp, the summer fun camp back to

1206
01:43:29,589 --> 01:43:32,251
[SPEAKER_15]: The Columbus School and the children used to walk to the pool.

1207
01:43:32,551 --> 01:43:34,432
[SPEAKER_15]: So I was giving her some history of that.

1208
01:43:34,532 --> 01:43:40,095
[SPEAKER_15]: So there is still a pool accessible, and it did work there for a few years.

1209
01:43:40,215 --> 01:43:49,260
[SPEAKER_15]: And based on the heat, and if we can't fix the issue by next summer, I think that, you know, that is a strong possibility for that location again.

1210
01:43:50,361 --> 01:43:57,105
[SPEAKER_15]: But since Melanie came forward and spoke a little bit about the special education path,

1211
01:43:57,833 --> 01:44:06,736
[SPEAKER_15]: I wanted to request information from the committee on who is on the subcommittee for the special education subcommittee.

1212
01:44:07,036 --> 01:44:17,560
[SPEAKER_15]: I know I'm the chairperson, and I know we announced it at the end of last year, and I didn't catch the names of the other members, because I would like to call for a meeting within the next two weeks.

1213
01:44:17,660 --> 01:44:19,700
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll revise the full list.

1214
01:44:20,361 --> 01:44:21,261
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, okay.

1215
01:44:21,901 --> 01:44:22,822
[SPEAKER_15]: That would be terrific.

1216
01:44:23,502 --> 01:44:27,163
[SPEAKER_15]: I did have an opportunity just to follow up to meet

1217
01:44:27,752 --> 01:44:35,375
[SPEAKER_15]: with Melanie a few weeks ago and just prioritize a few issues to be discussed at that committee.

1218
01:44:35,615 --> 01:44:39,016
[SPEAKER_15]: So we would like to move forward with that quickly, Mayor Burke.

1219
01:44:39,156 --> 01:44:41,537
[SPEAKER_15]: So your help with that would be very important.

1220
01:44:41,577 --> 01:44:41,957
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1221
01:44:43,658 --> 01:44:51,461
[SPEAKER_15]: Secondly, I'd like to know where those air conditioners maybe went.

1222
01:44:51,501 --> 01:44:55,322
[SPEAKER_15]: And so that way, if we do need them in the next week or two, because we are still

1223
01:44:55,968 --> 01:44:59,050
[SPEAKER_15]: I know the heat wave's supposed to break tomorrow, but it could come back.

1224
01:44:59,470 --> 01:45:03,553
[SPEAKER_15]: So, I mean, there's probably areas that really could use them if we could look around.

1225
01:45:04,053 --> 01:45:09,117
[SPEAKER_15]: Or do we wanna consider that AC fundraiser?

1226
01:45:09,917 --> 01:45:15,781
[SPEAKER_15]: I know it's a draw on electrical and it caused other issues, but we need to look outside the box sometimes.

1227
01:45:16,402 --> 01:45:21,845
[SPEAKER_15]: And people coming forward with ideas and outside the box is beneficial to this community.

1228
01:45:21,885 --> 01:45:25,508
[SPEAKER_15]: So I don't wanna just like, okay, we couldn't find them and move on.

1229
01:45:25,881 --> 01:45:27,001
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's figure it out.

1230
01:45:28,061 --> 01:45:36,963
[SPEAKER_15]: Also, not only is the summer fun program an issue, I would like to see unification of our out of school time programming.

1231
01:45:37,483 --> 01:45:46,325
[SPEAKER_15]: So it would be the morning before school programming, the after school programming, the week long camp programming, and the summer programming.

1232
01:45:46,625 --> 01:45:55,427
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd like to look at that as one big program and make sure that we have great staff and great curriculum and great things for children to do.

1233
01:45:55,730 --> 01:46:08,293
[SPEAKER_15]: But I also want to make sure that it's deliberate and it's inclusional to students that are EL students as well as special education students or any other students with needs, financial or whatever.

1234
01:46:08,613 --> 01:46:19,696
[SPEAKER_15]: So I would like to, I don't know which committee that should go under, but I really would like to work on that through this year and really build an excellent programming because our job as

1235
01:46:20,272 --> 01:46:25,293
[SPEAKER_15]: community members, and as teachers, and as administrators, and as mayor, is to serve our community.

1236
01:46:25,573 --> 01:46:34,735
[SPEAKER_15]: And there's a great need for our community, because most parents are working parents, for this out-of-school time, educational piece, care piece.

1237
01:46:35,075 --> 01:46:37,055
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think it's building every year.

1238
01:46:37,175 --> 01:46:45,336
[SPEAKER_15]: And we're not meeting the needs of our community currently, because the staffing, because our program hasn't grown as big as our need has.

1239
01:46:45,617 --> 01:46:47,517
[SPEAKER_15]: And I really would like to,

1240
01:46:48,828 --> 01:47:01,154
[SPEAKER_15]: work with different people in the community, not just school people, but people in the community who want to volunteer and invest in making this a great thing for our school system and our community as a whole.

1241
01:47:01,654 --> 01:47:04,996
[SPEAKER_15]: So I don't know which subcommittee should take that on.

1242
01:47:08,275 --> 01:47:14,719
[SPEAKER_15]: I really would like to work on that personally, Mayor Burke, so maybe you could put some thought into that while you're looking at that.

1243
01:47:14,999 --> 01:47:16,880
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, thank you for your time.

1244
01:47:17,201 --> 01:47:19,662
[SPEAKER_15]: And one last thing, since we're on suspension of rules.

1245
01:47:20,223 --> 01:47:21,203
[SPEAKER_15]: We're still on this paper.

1246
01:47:21,363 --> 01:47:23,224
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, when we're done, thank you.

1247
01:47:23,745 --> 01:47:24,325
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Russo.

1248
01:47:26,166 --> 01:47:32,490
[SPEAKER_04]: Along those same lines, would it be possible at the next meeting or the meeting after to get a report from the new director of?

1249
01:47:34,211 --> 01:47:35,112
[SPEAKER_16]: Before and after school.

1250
01:47:35,252 --> 01:47:36,553
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, before and after school.

1251
01:47:37,744 --> 01:47:40,205
[SPEAKER_04]: And do you have something coming on?

1252
01:47:40,225 --> 01:47:41,966
[SPEAKER_04]: She's already on, you've already asked.

1253
01:47:43,207 --> 01:47:43,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1254
01:47:45,968 --> 01:47:56,173
[SPEAKER_16]: And on the original paper, which was the building and grounds paper, we're asking for a full report, as well as a follow-up report on the air conditioning systems throughout the system.

1255
01:47:56,893 --> 01:48:01,635
[SPEAKER_16]: On that motion, authored by Mr. Russo, seconded by Ms.

1256
01:48:01,655 --> 01:48:03,156
[SPEAKER_16]: Van Der Poot, I believe you asked the question.

1257
01:48:03,997 --> 01:48:04,617
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

1258
01:48:05,703 --> 01:48:06,424
[SPEAKER_16]: All those opposed?

1259
01:48:06,984 --> 01:48:07,704
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion is granted.

1260
01:48:09,445 --> 01:48:12,526
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, while we're in the suspension, Mr. Benedetto, what would you like to discuss?

1261
01:48:12,566 --> 01:48:13,847
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much.

1262
01:48:14,687 --> 01:48:16,248
[SPEAKER_15]: The dedication of the band room.

1263
01:48:16,368 --> 01:48:33,817
[SPEAKER_15]: I know I discussed it with former superintendent and Mayor Burke last year about dedicating the band, the possibility of dedicating the band room to Lina Gigentomaso, who was a 30 year school committee member who really advocated for the,

1264
01:48:34,817 --> 01:48:38,059
[SPEAKER_15]: those students in the fine arts department in that way.

1265
01:48:38,439 --> 01:48:41,681
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'd like to make a motion for the superintendent.

1266
01:48:42,802 --> 01:48:48,626
[SPEAKER_16]: If we could add, I was informed that in prior years when we did namings, that we'd have a committee of the whole.

1267
01:48:48,666 --> 01:48:49,086
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe Ms.

1268
01:48:49,106 --> 01:48:52,108
[SPEAKER_16]: Vanden Heuvel could add to this, because we weren't part of any of this, or I wasn't.

1269
01:48:55,904 --> 01:49:00,127
[SPEAKER_19]: And it was, it had to go, and again, I really have to look back.

1270
01:49:00,147 --> 01:49:01,669
[SPEAKER_19]: It had to go to committee of the whole.

1271
01:49:02,009 --> 01:49:03,410
[SPEAKER_19]: It couldn't just be done on the floor.

1272
01:49:03,510 --> 01:49:05,832
[SPEAKER_19]: We couldn't just say, oh, yes, we're going to name it for somebody.

1273
01:49:07,053 --> 01:49:11,657
[SPEAKER_19]: And, you know, more, a little more information needed to be coming.

1274
01:49:11,697 --> 01:49:19,383
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, I'm sure we're all in favor of Lena being honored, but there is a process, and I think that there's a reason to keep to the process.

1275
01:49:20,110 --> 01:49:22,552
[SPEAKER_19]: So I think we need to send it to a committee of the whole.

1276
01:49:23,813 --> 01:49:39,944
[SPEAKER_19]: And I do forget there's some recommendation involved if we could look into it and check back to what it was just so that we're following our policy.

1277
01:49:39,964 --> 01:49:41,545
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

1278
01:49:41,665 --> 01:49:45,607
[SPEAKER_16]: We can have that policy given out to us.

1279
01:49:45,668 --> 01:49:48,129
[SPEAKER_16]: And then you can send it to committee of the whole so we can evaluate it.

1280
01:49:51,931 --> 01:49:56,033
[SPEAKER_15]: I agree in following that, and I want to do it correctly.

1281
01:49:56,573 --> 01:50:01,755
[SPEAKER_15]: Timing would be good to move forward quicker than not.

1282
01:50:02,515 --> 01:50:02,715
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.

1283
01:50:04,536 --> 01:50:07,417
[SPEAKER_15]: And it was requested, again,

1284
01:50:08,290 --> 01:50:10,651
[SPEAKER_15]: last year through the superintendent and the mayor.

1285
01:50:10,671 --> 01:50:12,092
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't recall it being the band room.

1286
01:50:12,112 --> 01:50:13,253
[SPEAKER_15]: It wasn't on the floor.

1287
01:50:13,413 --> 01:50:14,233
[SPEAKER_15]: It wasn't on the floor.

1288
01:50:14,253 --> 01:50:15,014
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's do something.

1289
01:50:15,694 --> 01:50:17,835
[SPEAKER_15]: I asked them to look into it months ago.

1290
01:50:18,055 --> 01:50:20,917
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, the band room is now a designation.

1291
01:50:23,038 --> 01:50:30,662
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll get some information to the superintendent so that she can send it out and we can set up a meeting.

1292
01:50:30,782 --> 01:50:32,563
[SPEAKER_16]: And have it on the next agenda.

1293
01:50:32,864 --> 01:50:33,124
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

1294
01:50:33,584 --> 01:50:33,684
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

1295
01:50:33,864 --> 01:50:35,305
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, again, we can't vote it.

1296
01:50:35,365 --> 01:50:36,566
[SPEAKER_19]: There was definitely a process.

1297
01:50:36,586 --> 01:50:38,508
[SPEAKER_19]: We can't just vote it at a school committee meeting.

1298
01:50:38,568 --> 01:50:39,628
[SPEAKER_19]: And we can look at it.

1299
01:50:39,648 --> 01:50:43,371
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe we could have it before the meeting and then bring it to the floor that night?

1300
01:50:43,591 --> 01:50:46,733
[SPEAKER_19]: I believe that there was, we could have it in a separate meeting before.

1301
01:50:47,574 --> 01:50:53,078
[SPEAKER_19]: The reasoning behind it, there was a very exact reason behind it, which hasn't always been followed.

1302
01:50:53,875 --> 01:51:04,904
[SPEAKER_19]: It's true, but the reasoning behind it is that we just didn't want someone coming up and all of a sudden saying, oh yeah, we should name this four, without reflective thought, and does that make sense, and what is the larger picture, so that's why.

1303
01:51:05,204 --> 01:51:23,238
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'd like to respectfully request that if we do need to have a committee of the whole, that we could do that prior to the next meeting, like right an hour before, and then go into the meeting, and if so warranted by our committee, move forward with it at that meeting and vote it on, so that way it can take place

1304
01:51:23,984 --> 01:51:26,347
[SPEAKER_15]: on the following meeting, which would be?

1305
01:51:26,828 --> 01:51:30,733
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll comply with the policy, and if it allows for that, that will be our next meeting.

1306
01:51:30,753 --> 01:51:33,377
[SPEAKER_16]: We can schedule it 15 or a half hour before the meeting.

1307
01:51:33,657 --> 01:51:33,857
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

1308
01:51:33,917 --> 01:51:36,741
[SPEAKER_16]: If the policy calls for it being on the floor first, we'll follow that.

1309
01:51:36,761 --> 01:51:36,801
[SPEAKER_16]: OK.

1310
01:51:36,922 --> 01:51:37,242
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1311
01:51:37,282 --> 01:51:39,385
[SPEAKER_16]: We have to refresh ourselves on that policy.

1312
01:51:39,425 --> 01:51:39,785
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1313
01:51:39,805 --> 01:51:40,586
[SPEAKER_16]: OK.

1314
01:51:40,687 --> 01:51:41,047
[SPEAKER_15]: Very good.

1315
01:51:41,067 --> 01:51:41,508
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Paulette.

1316
01:51:42,612 --> 01:51:47,795
[SPEAKER_16]: Is there a motion to revert to the regular order of business by Mr. Russo, seconded by Ms.

1317
01:51:47,855 --> 01:51:48,195
[SPEAKER_16]: Kretz?

1318
01:51:48,375 --> 01:51:49,235
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

1319
01:51:49,456 --> 01:51:49,976
[SPEAKER_16]: May avert.

1320
01:51:50,116 --> 01:51:51,096
[SPEAKER_16]: All those opposed?

1321
01:51:51,316 --> 01:51:53,438
[SPEAKER_16]: Can I ask one quick poll question?

1322
01:51:53,458 --> 01:51:55,018
[SPEAKER_16]: We're back on regulation here.

1323
01:51:55,058 --> 01:51:55,899
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1324
01:51:57,159 --> 01:51:59,601
[SPEAKER_16]: Item two, report on administrative meetings.

1325
01:52:01,001 --> 01:52:01,202
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

1326
01:52:01,242 --> 01:52:01,682
[SPEAKER_16]: Caldwell.

1327
01:52:02,842 --> 01:52:04,603
[SPEAKER_09]: Good evening, everybody, and welcome back.

1328
01:52:04,623 --> 01:52:05,764
[SPEAKER_09]: It's nice to see you all.

1329
01:52:07,023 --> 01:52:12,005
[SPEAKER_09]: So the first report I'm going to give you is on our administrative week.

1330
01:52:12,785 --> 01:52:18,867
[SPEAKER_09]: As you know, we met between August 20th and August 24th for administrators and for teachers.

1331
01:52:19,607 --> 01:52:26,389
[SPEAKER_09]: And our new administrators are, you've been introduced, but the most famous of all, of course, is Dr. Maryse Edouard-Vincent.

1332
01:52:27,029 --> 01:52:35,912
[SPEAKER_09]: So we welcome her, as well as our new principal, Michael Downs, Dr. Stacey Mulligan, our assistant principal, Stephen Burnett.

1333
01:52:35,932 --> 01:52:36,632
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's Burnett.

1334
01:52:38,117 --> 01:52:42,700
[SPEAKER_09]: Katie Champoli, and Faiza Khan, who is a new addition in mathematics.

1335
01:52:43,481 --> 01:52:54,030
[SPEAKER_09]: In addition to our new administrators, we are proud to have Paul DeLeva as our new headmaster of Medford High School, as well as Nick Tucci on board as the McGlynn Middle School principal.

1336
01:52:54,530 --> 01:52:55,691
[SPEAKER_09]: We welcome them both.

1337
01:52:56,372 --> 01:53:03,498
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just want to personally thank Bernadette Riccidelli, Dr. Riccidelli, for providing her experience and her expertise and assistance

1338
01:53:03,888 --> 01:53:06,689
[SPEAKER_09]: to the foreign language department for this school year.

1339
01:53:07,690 --> 01:53:12,752
[SPEAKER_09]: Superintendent Edward Vincent welcomed our administrators back in our new bistro.

1340
01:53:12,812 --> 01:53:14,652
[SPEAKER_09]: So she's doing everything new at the helm.

1341
01:53:14,812 --> 01:53:16,073
[SPEAKER_09]: It was so much fun.

1342
01:53:16,593 --> 01:53:23,396
[SPEAKER_09]: We had an icebreaker activity and we learned about Dr. Vincent with her identity tree.

1343
01:53:23,976 --> 01:53:28,098
[SPEAKER_09]: But she also was clear about her expectations for the school year.

1344
01:53:28,638 --> 01:53:30,819
[SPEAKER_09]: Her passion for education and excitement

1345
01:53:31,158 --> 01:53:33,499
[SPEAKER_09]: to get into our classrooms is palpable.

1346
01:53:33,959 --> 01:53:36,561
[SPEAKER_09]: And as you saw in the video, she was there.

1347
01:53:36,741 --> 01:53:38,021
[SPEAKER_09]: She was in classrooms.

1348
01:53:38,501 --> 01:53:44,164
[SPEAKER_09]: Even today, we were on the third floor, the second floor of the high school, checking out the heat situation as well.

1349
01:53:45,485 --> 01:53:46,805
[SPEAKER_09]: We also had a very busy summer.

1350
01:53:46,965 --> 01:53:51,387
[SPEAKER_09]: We were hiring new staff, buying new materials, scheduling students.

1351
01:53:51,968 --> 01:53:56,810
[SPEAKER_09]: At our administrative meetings, we discussed topics and matters of concern for the upcoming school year.

1352
01:53:57,630 --> 01:54:00,952
[SPEAKER_09]: Assistant Superintendent and Director of Finance Christine Patterson,

1353
01:54:01,577 --> 01:54:10,299
[SPEAKER_09]: updated the ASOP frontline system, payroll automation, and employee portal, as well as bus routes, which is always interesting.

1354
01:54:11,039 --> 01:54:20,461
[SPEAKER_09]: Dr. Riccadeli discussed our new teacher induction week and the educator evaluation, and you will hear from Dr. Riccadeli in a little bit about the new teacher induction.

1355
01:54:22,201 --> 01:54:25,782
[SPEAKER_09]: We also discussed rebooting the social-emotional learning.

1356
01:54:25,842 --> 01:54:28,983
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that Stacey Shulman will be working on that as well.

1357
01:54:29,762 --> 01:54:36,186
[SPEAKER_09]: Director of Pupil Services, Kathleen Madaglio, provided our team with an update on the coordinated program review.

1358
01:54:37,387 --> 01:54:41,930
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'll just take a moment to congratulate Kathy Madaglio for all her hard work.

1359
01:54:42,490 --> 01:54:46,653
[SPEAKER_09]: We excelled and we are very proud of the work that she does for us.

1360
01:54:47,673 --> 01:54:54,718
[SPEAKER_09]: In addition, we provided our administrative staff with updates from DESE, including licensure and the new Janus ruling.

1361
01:54:55,790 --> 01:55:00,055
[SPEAKER_09]: It is an exciting new beginning for all of us with Superintendent Vinson at the helm.

1362
01:55:00,575 --> 01:55:05,100
[SPEAKER_09]: The first day of school, as you saw, with the teachers, she rolled out the red carpet.

1363
01:55:05,161 --> 01:55:11,648
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, I remember getting a text from her the day before and there was something about hula skirts.

1364
01:55:12,155 --> 01:55:13,816
[SPEAKER_09]: And I said, oh my gosh, where is she now?

1365
01:55:13,876 --> 01:55:20,502
[SPEAKER_09]: And she was at party time, buying the red carpet and stars and wondering if we could get a DJ, I believe.

1366
01:55:22,403 --> 01:55:28,528
[SPEAKER_09]: Our official first week of school began on Tuesday, August 28th, and what a hot one it was.

1367
01:55:29,168 --> 01:55:35,393
[SPEAKER_09]: The elementary and middle schools had full days and the high schools were dismissed at noontime due to the excessive heat.

1368
01:55:35,934 --> 01:55:39,937
[SPEAKER_09]: Water was delivered to all of our schools to ensure our students were well hydrated.

1369
01:55:40,988 --> 01:55:47,392
[SPEAKER_09]: We would like to thank all of our administrative staff who worked tirelessly over the summer to ensure a smooth transition.

1370
01:55:48,073 --> 01:55:55,758
[SPEAKER_09]: And I've included, I've attached an agenda of the different topics that we discussed during admin week.

1371
01:55:56,698 --> 01:55:58,179
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd be happy to take any questions.

1372
01:55:58,199 --> 01:55:59,280
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much, Ms.

1373
01:55:59,320 --> 01:55:59,840
[SPEAKER_16]: Caldwell.

1374
01:56:00,681 --> 01:56:01,321
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Russo?

1375
01:56:02,042 --> 01:56:03,362
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, thank you for this report.

1376
01:56:03,583 --> 01:56:08,346
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was, I showed up for the very beginning of the administrators.

1377
01:56:10,824 --> 01:56:12,345
[SPEAKER_16]: You missed the red carpet, though.

1378
01:56:12,405 --> 01:56:16,686
[SPEAKER_04]: I missed the red carpet, and I was very, very sad, actually.

1379
01:56:16,826 --> 01:56:17,346
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty cool, pretty cool.

1380
01:56:17,626 --> 01:56:20,147
[SPEAKER_04]: I somehow missed that there was that going on.

1381
01:56:20,207 --> 01:56:21,267
[SPEAKER_04]: I showed up a little afterwards.

1382
01:56:21,347 --> 01:56:29,350
[SPEAKER_04]: But you mentioned something that just made me realize that I wanted to ask, when can we get a copy of the CPR?

1383
01:56:29,390 --> 01:56:32,551
[SPEAKER_04]: The state's website apparently puts it up like two years later.

1384
01:56:32,631 --> 01:56:33,891
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, well, that's nice, but.

1385
01:56:33,911 --> 01:56:37,132
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to wait until the district responds to you.

1386
01:56:40,887 --> 01:56:44,530
[SPEAKER_04]: It will probably be up in the next couple of weeks.

1387
01:56:44,570 --> 01:56:44,610
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

1388
01:56:45,030 --> 01:56:46,191
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you send that to us?

1389
01:56:46,291 --> 01:56:51,175
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the state, like right now, I think 2016 is the latest one I saw on the website when I went and looked.

1390
01:56:51,355 --> 01:56:53,036
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, that's.

1391
01:56:53,096 --> 01:56:54,017
[SPEAKER_04]: There are currently, maybe on the polls.

1392
01:56:54,077 --> 01:56:54,117
Oh.

1393
01:56:54,137 --> 01:56:54,177
OK.

1394
01:56:54,577 --> 01:56:57,619
[SPEAKER_04]: But there are current reports different.

1395
01:56:57,640 --> 01:56:58,460
[SPEAKER_04]: So that just has to be.

1396
01:56:58,500 --> 01:56:58,560
[SPEAKER_13]: OK.

1397
01:56:58,580 --> 01:57:02,443
[SPEAKER_13]: It's already been generated by the Congress.

1398
01:57:02,463 --> 01:57:02,583
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm-hmm.

1399
01:57:02,703 --> 01:57:06,226
[SPEAKER_13]: But as of now, we will make sure that they don't come.

1400
01:57:06,406 --> 01:57:06,486
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

1401
01:57:06,506 --> 01:57:06,746
[SPEAKER_15]: It will be.

1402
01:57:06,766 --> 01:57:07,046
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1403
01:57:07,387 --> 01:57:07,867
[SPEAKER_16]: Definitely.

1404
01:57:08,628 --> 01:57:09,048
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1405
01:57:09,608 --> 01:57:10,249
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Benedetto.

1406
01:57:11,236 --> 01:57:19,120
[SPEAKER_15]: That was one of my questions, is when that will be presented to the school committee, as well as, is the bistro open?

1407
01:57:20,280 --> 01:57:21,801
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's a very good question.

1408
01:57:21,821 --> 01:57:23,262
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure I can answer that.

1409
01:57:23,482 --> 01:57:25,263
[SPEAKER_09]: Are we open for business, Dr. Benson?

1410
01:57:25,343 --> 01:57:30,185
[SPEAKER_20]: The bistro's not officially open, but the students are baking cookies.

1411
01:57:30,285 --> 01:57:32,906
[SPEAKER_20]: I did get fresh blueberry muffins today.

1412
01:57:33,506 --> 01:57:40,570
[SPEAKER_20]: So they are practicing, they're setting up tables, and I think it's gonna be at least another week or two before they start actually serving.

1413
01:57:41,398 --> 01:57:43,979
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're actually using the Bistro, and it was so hot.

1414
01:57:44,939 --> 01:57:47,140
[SPEAKER_09]: We had some classrooms at the vocational school.

1415
01:57:47,700 --> 01:57:51,662
[SPEAKER_09]: I know we were doing hair at the cosmetology or something in there one day.

1416
01:57:52,722 --> 01:57:58,445
[SPEAKER_09]: And we had our Lesley University meeting on professional development in our little room over there.

1417
01:57:58,525 --> 01:58:00,225
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's being utilized.

1418
01:58:02,586 --> 01:58:07,228
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'd like to just say, I don't want to be remiss if I didn't mention the color guard.

1419
01:58:07,766 --> 01:58:12,391
[SPEAKER_09]: as well as the cheerleaders when they were coming down besides the band.

1420
01:58:12,511 --> 01:58:13,312
[SPEAKER_09]: It was awesome.

1421
01:58:13,592 --> 01:58:14,313
[SPEAKER_09]: It was really fun.

1422
01:58:14,774 --> 01:58:20,399
[SPEAKER_18]: Tomorrow night is the football opening game against Lynn Classical.

1423
01:58:20,419 --> 01:58:22,622
[SPEAKER_18]: The marching band will be performing halftime.

1424
01:58:22,642 --> 01:58:26,526
[SPEAKER_18]: The greatest showman, the movie, the greatest showman is the music.

1425
01:58:27,014 --> 01:58:29,875
[SPEAKER_18]: So if everyone wants to come out and support Medford football.

1426
01:58:30,015 --> 01:58:30,895
[SPEAKER_18]: It's at seven o'clock, right?

1427
01:58:30,915 --> 01:58:31,296
[SPEAKER_09]: Tomorrow, six.

1428
01:58:31,396 --> 01:58:33,817
[SPEAKER_18]: They switched, this year the football games start at six.

1429
01:58:34,097 --> 01:58:34,337
[SPEAKER_18]: Six.

1430
01:58:34,757 --> 01:58:36,497
[SPEAKER_18]: They used to be seven, now they're six.

1431
01:58:37,638 --> 01:58:37,918
[SPEAKER_16]: At Hormel.

1432
01:58:37,938 --> 01:58:38,758
[SPEAKER_16]: At Hormel, home over there.

1433
01:58:39,679 --> 01:58:47,982
[SPEAKER_16]: And also, just to mention, the band participated with our Dave McGilvery Day, honoring the 40th anniversary of Dave's famous run from Medford, Oregon to Medford, Mass.

1434
01:58:48,602 --> 01:58:53,944
[SPEAKER_16]: And they were spectacular, and I think they really appreciated being able to practice in front of, or play in front of,

1435
01:58:54,424 --> 01:58:56,285
[SPEAKER_16]: It was a great day.

1436
01:58:56,325 --> 01:58:57,285
[SPEAKER_16]: And it was an awesome day.

1437
01:58:57,406 --> 01:58:59,447
[SPEAKER_16]: So a lot of good things happened this summer.

1438
01:58:59,547 --> 01:59:01,207
[SPEAKER_16]: The zip trip came to Medford.

1439
01:59:01,888 --> 01:59:08,931
[SPEAKER_16]: It was just, it was a really fun, lighthearted, a lot of great things, great, I think accolades for the city.

1440
01:59:08,971 --> 01:59:11,152
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think everyone's really proud of that.

1441
01:59:11,853 --> 01:59:12,013
[SPEAKER_19]: Ms.

1442
01:59:12,033 --> 01:59:13,013
[SPEAKER_19]: Van de Kloot.

1443
01:59:13,113 --> 01:59:15,754
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, Diane, I just wanted to also thank you for your work.

1444
01:59:15,814 --> 01:59:23,058
[SPEAKER_19]: I know that you've had, as you've, we've been in this transition, you've had a large role and I wanted to thank you.

1445
01:59:23,674 --> 01:59:24,094
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Ms.

1446
01:59:24,134 --> 01:59:25,495
[SPEAKER_09]: Vander Kloot, appreciate that.

1447
01:59:26,436 --> 01:59:26,976
[SPEAKER_16]: Very good.

1448
01:59:27,797 --> 01:59:31,640
[SPEAKER_16]: On the motion that this report be accepted and placed on file by Ms.

1449
01:59:31,680 --> 01:59:33,781
[SPEAKER_16]: Vander Kloot, seconded by Mr. Russo.

1450
01:59:33,821 --> 01:59:34,542
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

1451
01:59:34,622 --> 01:59:34,882
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

1452
01:59:35,523 --> 01:59:36,303
[SPEAKER_16]: All those opposed?

1453
01:59:36,643 --> 01:59:37,864
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion passes, thank you.

1454
01:59:37,884 --> 01:59:41,547
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, next up, report on enrollment numbers.

1455
01:59:42,147 --> 01:59:52,735
[SPEAKER_09]: So I provided you with the enrollment numbers and it was given to you last week, so what you had was just one day's worth of enrollment numbers.

1456
01:59:53,299 --> 01:59:57,701
[SPEAKER_09]: But I provided you tonight with additional enrollment numbers.

1457
01:59:57,741 --> 02:00:00,362
[SPEAKER_09]: The kindergarten classes weren't in at the time.

1458
02:00:01,002 --> 02:00:06,945
[SPEAKER_09]: So you should have in front of you some enrollment numbers that are current as of today.

1459
02:00:06,965 --> 02:00:16,009
[SPEAKER_09]: I think you'll notice that the Columbus School first grade is low, but our kindergartens last year were low.

1460
02:00:16,069 --> 02:00:21,331
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm excited to say that the kindergarten at the Columbus School has grown.

1461
02:00:21,532 --> 02:00:22,472
[SPEAKER_09]: So those numbers are up.

1462
02:00:23,572 --> 02:00:26,837
[SPEAKER_09]: Our numbers at the McGlynn Kindergarten this year are a little bit lower.

1463
02:00:27,752 --> 02:00:36,394
[SPEAKER_09]: But I also wanted to let you know, it's still early, and at the Parent Information Center, they are so busy, they're continuing to register students.

1464
02:00:37,134 --> 02:00:54,097
[SPEAKER_09]: As of August 30th, we registered 56 pre-kindergarten students, 301 kindergarten students, and that was from March until August, and 197 grades one through 12 students, with 82 new ELL students.

1465
02:00:54,677 --> 02:00:57,598
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think Maria Ibrahim told us today that there were about

1466
02:00:58,396 --> 02:01:02,038
[SPEAKER_09]: 50 more students since this report, we gave you this report.

1467
02:01:02,078 --> 02:01:06,800
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're continuing to bring kids here into Medford, and we're very happy to do that.

1468
02:01:07,420 --> 02:01:07,921
[SPEAKER_16]: Very good.

1469
02:01:08,121 --> 02:01:10,142
[SPEAKER_16]: Is there a motion on the floor, or any questions?

1470
02:01:10,582 --> 02:01:11,402
[SPEAKER_16]: Trustee Benedetto.

1471
02:01:12,463 --> 02:01:13,463
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for the report.

1472
02:01:13,523 --> 02:01:15,804
[SPEAKER_15]: It's really good for us to see where we're at.

1473
02:01:16,084 --> 02:01:20,266
[SPEAKER_15]: There are a few areas of concern to me, as far as numbers.

1474
02:01:20,747 --> 02:01:25,729
[SPEAKER_15]: In Medford, we like to keep them down and low, and we've been successful in doing that for a lot of years.

1475
02:01:26,274 --> 02:01:33,135
[SPEAKER_15]: So the area that looks a little high to me, the Roberts Kindergarten classes with 22, that's a lot.

1476
02:01:33,236 --> 02:01:40,397
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just hoping, do they have full-time aides in those classrooms on all four of those?

1477
02:01:40,417 --> 02:01:40,397
20.

1478
02:01:40,617 --> 02:01:43,998
[SPEAKER_09]: The Roberts School has full-time kindergarten aides in those classes.

1479
02:01:44,698 --> 02:01:53,900
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think sometimes they include some of the connection kids in their numbers, so those students aren't in that classroom the full day.

1480
02:01:54,351 --> 02:01:56,933
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, and what about EL students that aren't in there?

1481
02:01:57,154 --> 02:01:58,395
[SPEAKER_15]: Are they counted in there?

1482
02:01:58,535 --> 02:02:02,338
[SPEAKER_09]: All of the EL students in kindergarten are in those classrooms, yes.

1483
02:02:02,439 --> 02:02:06,883
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, so my other concern in that same school is the third grade.

1484
02:02:06,943 --> 02:02:11,367
[SPEAKER_15]: They only have three third grade classes, and they're all 22 and 23.

1485
02:02:13,249 --> 02:02:18,974
[SPEAKER_15]: If more students were to matriculate to that school, those numbers wouldn't,

1486
02:02:20,857 --> 02:02:22,118
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'll tell you what I do.

1487
02:02:22,558 --> 02:02:28,260
[SPEAKER_09]: When the numbers get really high in the various grade levels, I ask Maria to just put a hold on that.

1488
02:02:28,880 --> 02:02:43,886
[SPEAKER_09]: And if there's a way I can move those students to the McGlynn School, of course we look at where they live, then I try to move them to a school that has less children in it, if it's at all possible, and if there are no other siblings in that school, because we have to think of families.

1489
02:02:43,946 --> 02:02:45,787
[SPEAKER_09]: But we are cognizant of the numbers.

1490
02:02:45,827 --> 02:02:46,667
[SPEAKER_09]: We do watch them.

1491
02:02:48,087 --> 02:02:48,948
[SPEAKER_15]: I appreciate that.

1492
02:02:49,862 --> 02:02:51,042
[SPEAKER_15]: I just like to highlight that.

1493
02:02:51,422 --> 02:03:05,605
[SPEAKER_15]: My other question is, when parents fill out emergency cards and parent information, a couple of parents have told me that they've filled out these cards a few times now.

1494
02:03:06,125 --> 02:03:08,025
[SPEAKER_15]: And isn't it done electronically?

1495
02:03:08,065 --> 02:03:09,225
[SPEAKER_15]: Don't we have school brains?

1496
02:03:09,285 --> 02:03:11,746
[SPEAKER_15]: Does the parent portal for the school brains work?

1497
02:03:11,806 --> 02:03:13,726
[SPEAKER_15]: And don't parents go online?

1498
02:03:14,126 --> 02:03:18,187
[SPEAKER_15]: I know at our school, all parents register online, and if they don't have

1499
02:03:18,745 --> 02:03:22,907
[SPEAKER_15]: access to that, we have special nights for parents to come in and we help them do that.

1500
02:03:23,187 --> 02:03:35,974
[SPEAKER_15]: So that way, if a new student's added or, you know, if you need a class list, you can print it out on, you know, as a teacher, it's helpful, and has emergency contact information on one sheet.

1501
02:03:36,974 --> 02:03:41,597
[SPEAKER_15]: And parents aren't required to fill out those little cards over and over again.

1502
02:03:41,617 --> 02:03:43,458
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I'm not sure what the little cards are.

1503
02:03:43,818 --> 02:03:47,060
[SPEAKER_18]: For the Andrews, Teagan and Colin brought home

1504
02:03:48,193 --> 02:03:51,874
[SPEAKER_18]: piece of paper this size already filled out with my information and Tim's information.

1505
02:03:52,154 --> 02:03:54,954
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's just that if there are changes, change it and sign it.

1506
02:03:56,315 --> 02:04:02,196
[SPEAKER_18]: Nevin, Rowan, and Declan, you're right, I had to fill out the same paper three times.

1507
02:04:03,056 --> 02:04:11,258
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know how the Andrews, if the Andrews School is just more familiar with the School Brains software that they just printed out and sent it home.

1508
02:04:12,510 --> 02:04:14,672
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know if Mr. DeLeva remembers.

1509
02:04:15,393 --> 02:04:17,055
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's a technology thing.

1510
02:04:17,195 --> 02:04:17,716
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know.

1511
02:04:17,736 --> 02:04:21,920
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, do the high school kids get a piece of paper already with the information on it?

1512
02:04:23,502 --> 02:04:25,685
[SPEAKER_24]: Basically, within the system.

1513
02:04:26,654 --> 02:04:28,735
[SPEAKER_24]: You can print out student information sheets.

1514
02:04:28,935 --> 02:04:31,216
[SPEAKER_24]: We'd like to do that to make sure that everything's up to date.

1515
02:04:31,356 --> 02:04:37,378
[SPEAKER_24]: We could go to the parent portal route, but like you said, not everybody's on the parent portal route.

1516
02:04:37,438 --> 02:04:43,019
[SPEAKER_24]: So it's easier for us to have that checklist regarding numbers, especially I live in Burlington.

1517
02:04:43,059 --> 02:04:47,601
[SPEAKER_24]: I just got the same sheet for my own children as well, just to verify numbers.

1518
02:04:48,338 --> 02:04:50,539
[SPEAKER_18]: So the high school, do you print it out and send it home?

1519
02:04:50,719 --> 02:04:59,683
[SPEAKER_24]: In all honesty, I haven't been privy to what that process is right now, but under my assumption, that's something that I would expect to be doing as well.

1520
02:04:59,783 --> 02:05:04,045
[SPEAKER_16]: So I guess the follow-up question is, are the elementaries doing it the same way?

1521
02:05:04,085 --> 02:05:05,005
[SPEAKER_16]: It sounds like they're not.

1522
02:05:05,225 --> 02:05:06,006
[SPEAKER_18]: Not at the Roberts.

1523
02:05:06,066 --> 02:05:08,847
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know about the Columbus, or the McGlynn, or the Brooks.

1524
02:05:09,247 --> 02:05:10,308
[SPEAKER_18]: Did you have to fill out paper?

1525
02:05:10,608 --> 02:05:11,728
[SPEAKER_18]: At the Columbus, yeah.

1526
02:05:12,008 --> 02:05:15,210
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I think most of them, because it changes oftentimes with,

1527
02:05:16,311 --> 02:05:19,793
[SPEAKER_09]: parents and numbers and cell phone numbers, so it changes, so they do.

1528
02:05:19,873 --> 02:05:24,455
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that at the Columbus that Dr. K does send forms home and the secretary collects them.

1529
02:05:24,475 --> 02:05:34,520
[SPEAKER_18]: But if it is a school brain's capability, it was nice to have Tegan and Cullen just say, mom, just check this, and me say it's all the same and pass it back in, then filling out.

1530
02:05:35,421 --> 02:05:36,902
[SPEAKER_09]: We can look into that for sure.

1531
02:05:36,942 --> 02:05:37,142
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

1532
02:05:37,502 --> 02:05:41,244
[SPEAKER_18]: To see how Mr. Downs did it, or Mr. DeLeva did it before he left.

1533
02:05:41,758 --> 02:05:47,143
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, my point is that we invested all this money into this programming that has so many options.

1534
02:05:47,183 --> 02:05:50,546
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think it's good for us to move forward in that way.

1535
02:05:50,566 --> 02:05:57,113
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's more convenient for most parents now.

1536
02:05:57,333 --> 02:06:00,696
[SPEAKER_15]: And of course, there are going to be some parents that need assistance with that.

1537
02:06:00,736 --> 02:06:05,421
[SPEAKER_15]: But you could have assistance night or registration night and help them with the process.

1538
02:06:05,461 --> 02:06:06,822
[SPEAKER_15]: And then you're also educating them.

1539
02:06:07,273 --> 02:06:11,657
[SPEAKER_15]: because as children get older, they use that for homework assignments, they use that for other things.

1540
02:06:11,717 --> 02:06:18,162
[SPEAKER_15]: So starting that in the beginning and moving forward in that direction is really where I want to see us moving.

1541
02:06:18,962 --> 02:06:24,647
[SPEAKER_15]: Plus, you know, we have parents, you know, filling out so many things repeatedly, the same things.

1542
02:06:24,727 --> 02:06:32,793
[SPEAKER_15]: If you have three kids and you're given that form three times, that's nine times you're filling out the same information and it gets, I got a call about it.

1543
02:06:34,074 --> 02:06:35,996
[SPEAKER_15]: Also, Parent Information Center,

1544
02:06:36,666 --> 02:06:41,009
[SPEAKER_15]: I talked to the superintendent quite a bit this summer about the process.

1545
02:06:42,050 --> 02:06:46,353
[SPEAKER_15]: I had a family member go through the process, so I got like a bird's eye view.

1546
02:06:47,134 --> 02:06:48,575
[SPEAKER_15]: I would like to streamline that.

1547
02:06:48,675 --> 02:07:06,107
[SPEAKER_15]: I would like to have some way, and our superintendent's on it, and I just wanna commend her for her responsiveness to not only my questions, but people's needs there, as well as maybe the EL department in talking to them about

1548
02:07:06,440 --> 02:07:10,703
[SPEAKER_15]: really having some way to welcome families and help them through that process as well.

1549
02:07:11,043 --> 02:07:14,946
[SPEAKER_09]: So just so you know, the EL, Paul Texera, does an incredible job.

1550
02:07:14,986 --> 02:07:15,846
[SPEAKER_09]: His staff is right.

1551
02:07:15,886 --> 02:07:18,008
[SPEAKER_09]: They are working with those families when they come in.

1552
02:07:18,568 --> 02:07:19,669
[SPEAKER_09]: I know Jesse tests them.

1553
02:07:20,069 --> 02:07:24,492
[SPEAKER_09]: We are looking to streamline things a little bit differently at the Parent Information Center.

1554
02:07:25,144 --> 02:07:28,887
[SPEAKER_09]: At the beginning of the school year, it is so, so busy.

1555
02:07:30,008 --> 02:07:35,332
[SPEAKER_09]: I asked one or two people to help Maria Ibrahim in that office for a few weeks, because she needed additional people.

1556
02:07:35,352 --> 02:07:38,354
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, and even through the summer, I think it's really difficult.

1557
02:07:38,434 --> 02:07:41,837
[SPEAKER_15]: And maybe opening different times for working parents, because our community is changing.

1558
02:07:41,857 --> 02:07:44,659
[SPEAKER_09]: So the opening different times for parents is definitely a need.

1559
02:07:44,719 --> 02:07:52,845
[SPEAKER_09]: We're looking to have maybe someone work from 7 to 3, and then maybe from 1 to 5 or 6, so that working parents

1560
02:07:53,255 --> 02:07:55,397
[SPEAKER_09]: can get into the Parent Information Center, definitely.

1561
02:07:55,878 --> 02:07:58,500
[SPEAKER_09]: But I got to tell you, the summer is not as busy as you think.

1562
02:07:59,281 --> 02:08:03,685
[SPEAKER_09]: July is not busy at all there, but come August, they're all coming in.

1563
02:08:03,905 --> 02:08:04,546
[SPEAKER_09]: They're moving in.

1564
02:08:04,726 --> 02:08:07,149
[SPEAKER_15]: And I also want to support the people that are working there.

1565
02:08:07,429 --> 02:08:15,617
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't want to, you know, fry them because they spend good time talking to each parent to make sure that they're onboarded well.

1566
02:08:15,972 --> 02:08:23,455
[SPEAKER_15]: and I just, that's our parents' first step into our community, so we really need to do that well, we need to present that well.

1567
02:08:24,315 --> 02:08:32,438
[SPEAKER_15]: And again, I just want to commend people for the work they've done and just keep moving forward to getting that better as we serve our community.

1568
02:08:33,138 --> 02:08:33,659
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1569
02:08:33,679 --> 02:08:45,403
[SPEAKER_16]: I just wanted to jump into, there's a lot of fresh eyes, I think, looking at processes throughout the district, so I think we're gonna have a very healthy dialogue about some changes just because of the freshness of the eyes.

1570
02:08:46,070 --> 02:08:46,590
[SPEAKER_16]: That's true.

1571
02:08:46,710 --> 02:08:47,471
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. DeLeva.

1572
02:08:47,551 --> 02:08:59,138
[SPEAKER_24]: I just wanted to actually direct it to Jasper regarding the school brains and how he utilizes it a little bit, because if that's what we're talking about, he has a student perspective on how it's used.

1573
02:08:59,258 --> 02:09:00,659
[SPEAKER_16]: Jasper, step up to the mic.

1574
02:09:00,779 --> 02:09:01,219
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's hear.

1575
02:09:03,141 --> 02:09:03,801
[SPEAKER_16]: Come over here, Jasper.

1576
02:09:03,821 --> 02:09:04,762
[SPEAKER_16]: You can use Michael's.

1577
02:09:04,882 --> 02:09:12,686
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Mr. DeLeva.

1578
02:09:14,278 --> 02:09:21,521
[SPEAKER_21]: School brains I use personally to check my grades, but past that, not very often.

1579
02:09:22,281 --> 02:09:38,307
[SPEAKER_21]: I see a lot of teachers use Google Classroom more often to hand assignments in, but they're all graded on school brains, so it's kind of a thing where it's like assigned on Google Classroom, we can get our assignments there, and then to check the grades thereafter, like a couple days later, we'll check on school brains.

1580
02:09:39,227 --> 02:09:41,808
[SPEAKER_21]: I would like it to be used all in one, it would be really great.

1581
02:09:42,815 --> 02:09:48,537
[SPEAKER_21]: And also, like you talked about beforehand, getting parents information on there, that would be really useful too.

1582
02:09:49,217 --> 02:09:54,459
[SPEAKER_21]: I think a lot of people are moving towards using technology and a lot of people are more affluent on it.

1583
02:09:55,300 --> 02:09:58,081
[SPEAKER_21]: And if it was all in one center, it'd be really great.

1584
02:09:58,201 --> 02:09:59,621
[SPEAKER_21]: So, yeah.

1585
02:09:59,641 --> 02:10:00,001
[SPEAKER_16]: Very good.

1586
02:10:01,322 --> 02:10:02,142
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Jasper.

1587
02:10:04,263 --> 02:10:04,903
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Russo.

1588
02:10:07,744 --> 02:10:10,305
[SPEAKER_04]: The grade six enrollment numbers

1589
02:10:11,225 --> 02:10:19,969
[SPEAKER_04]: between the two schools in the report we were given in our packets, shows exactly the same number.

1590
02:10:20,309 --> 02:10:22,490
[SPEAKER_09]: So I need you to know, I noticed that too.

1591
02:10:22,530 --> 02:10:24,191
[SPEAKER_09]: I was waiting for somebody to notice that.

1592
02:10:24,211 --> 02:10:32,814
[SPEAKER_09]: I emailed and called both middle school principals because I didn't believe they could be exactly the same.

1593
02:10:32,874 --> 02:10:34,275
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't think they would be the same.

1594
02:10:34,735 --> 02:10:35,896
[SPEAKER_09]: But in fact, they were.

1595
02:10:35,916 --> 02:10:37,416
[SPEAKER_09]: It was 140 and 140.

1596
02:10:39,578 --> 02:10:46,744
[SPEAKER_09]: Although, I must admit, I checked with Mr. Texera, who said that two more students came in for the McGlynn Middle School.

1597
02:10:47,224 --> 02:10:49,406
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think the McGlynn is ahead by a few now.

1598
02:10:49,886 --> 02:10:55,090
[SPEAKER_04]: So them being very much the same number was very interesting.

1599
02:10:55,190 --> 02:11:01,835
[SPEAKER_04]: But I guess the hard question I really want to ask is, did people leave the district because they did not get the Andrews?

1600
02:11:02,336 --> 02:11:03,717
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't have an answer to that.

1601
02:11:05,518 --> 02:11:07,840
[SPEAKER_04]: At the beginning of the summer.

1602
02:11:08,709 --> 02:11:20,593
[SPEAKER_04]: after we had done the randomization, which I wish I could remember the numbers off the top of my head, I think the Andrews was still a dozen or more than the McGlenn.

1603
02:11:23,574 --> 02:11:26,234
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking in our packets on... Ms.

1604
02:11:26,394 --> 02:11:27,475
[SPEAKER_09]: Stone, is this sheet here?

1605
02:11:27,495 --> 02:11:28,435
[SPEAKER_09]: The new report or the old?

1606
02:11:29,495 --> 02:11:30,336
[SPEAKER_04]: The old report.

1607
02:11:31,516 --> 02:11:37,638
[SPEAKER_04]: The old report has the one that was included in our packets, not the new ones.

1608
02:11:38,907 --> 02:11:39,567
[SPEAKER_04]: Last page.

1609
02:11:39,828 --> 02:11:39,968
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

1610
02:11:39,988 --> 02:11:41,068
[SPEAKER_09]: Mastone, it looks like this.

1611
02:11:46,192 --> 02:11:50,815
[SPEAKER_04]: But them being very much the same, that was just fine.

1612
02:11:53,136 --> 02:11:59,781
[SPEAKER_16]: It was in the original report with the cover letter, but the report we got tonight, the numbers are different.

1613
02:11:59,881 --> 02:12:00,061
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

1614
02:12:00,141 --> 02:12:01,242
[SPEAKER_09]: It's on the original report.

1615
02:12:01,262 --> 02:12:02,042
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you have this report?

1616
02:12:03,083 --> 02:12:07,686
[SPEAKER_04]: But the numbers for tonight, this is just attendance, not enrollment, correct?

1617
02:12:08,655 --> 02:12:10,976
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm showing 141 and 134.

1618
02:12:13,537 --> 02:12:17,338
[SPEAKER_09]: So on 9-4, the grade six numbers were 140 and 140.

1619
02:12:17,958 --> 02:12:20,599
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's what Mr. Rousseau is referring to.

1620
02:12:20,619 --> 02:12:22,560
[SPEAKER_16]: But now tonight's report is different.

1621
02:12:23,781 --> 02:12:23,981
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1622
02:12:24,361 --> 02:12:24,601
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1623
02:12:25,881 --> 02:12:30,163
[SPEAKER_16]: So six kids have disappeared, I guess.

1624
02:12:34,757 --> 02:12:36,278
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, if we could get a report on that.

1625
02:12:37,899 --> 02:12:39,539
[SPEAKER_16]: You requesting a report, Mr. Russo?

1626
02:12:39,559 --> 02:12:39,599
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

1627
02:12:40,220 --> 02:12:42,641
[SPEAKER_16]: On whether or not we lost any students to the lottery?

1628
02:12:43,821 --> 02:12:46,963
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just, I'm confused by the second page.

1629
02:12:47,183 --> 02:12:54,326
[SPEAKER_04]: This is enrollment, because literally from one day to the next, the enrollment changed between the schools.

1630
02:12:56,067 --> 02:13:00,629
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I don't, the second page is not enrollment at all, it's just attendance.

1631
02:13:02,236 --> 02:13:04,917
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you talking about which page, this one here?

1632
02:13:05,157 --> 02:13:09,299
[SPEAKER_04]: So in the new sheets we got, we got one for September 5th and one for September 6th.

1633
02:13:09,679 --> 02:13:10,019
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

1634
02:13:10,780 --> 02:13:16,402
[SPEAKER_04]: The September 5th one, it says right there clearly, this is attendance, who showed up, not who's enrolled in our schools.

1635
02:13:18,803 --> 02:13:19,023
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

1636
02:13:19,663 --> 02:13:23,665
[SPEAKER_04]: And on the second page, it's the same thing, this is attendance, this is not enrollment.

1637
02:13:24,745 --> 02:13:25,166
[SPEAKER_09]: Correct.

1638
02:13:25,746 --> 02:13:30,528
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, when having conversations about

1639
02:13:31,750 --> 02:13:34,152
[SPEAKER_04]: class size and how many people are at each school.

1640
02:13:34,212 --> 02:13:36,473
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not talking about attendance on any day.

1641
02:13:36,493 --> 02:13:38,575
[SPEAKER_04]: We're always talking about enrollment correct.

1642
02:13:39,075 --> 02:13:40,296
[SPEAKER_16]: Enrollment not attendance.

1643
02:13:40,536 --> 02:13:40,856
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

1644
02:13:41,157 --> 02:13:48,382
[SPEAKER_04]: So at the moment we don't have enrollment numbers for the schools.

1645
02:13:49,843 --> 02:13:51,764
[SPEAKER_04]: Well we do for the elementary schools.

1646
02:13:51,904 --> 02:13:55,487
[SPEAKER_04]: The last page has the elementary schools that Brooks has 504 etc.

1647
02:13:56,007 --> 02:13:59,870
[SPEAKER_04]: But we don't know how many kids are enrolled at the middle school.

1648
02:14:00,643 --> 02:14:01,564
[SPEAKER_04]: or the high school right now?

1649
02:14:01,744 --> 02:14:02,264
[SPEAKER_09]: In total?

1650
02:14:02,384 --> 02:14:02,684
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1651
02:14:03,385 --> 02:14:04,085
[SPEAKER_09]: We do where?

1652
02:14:04,465 --> 02:14:04,706
[SPEAKER_09]: Here.

1653
02:14:05,566 --> 02:14:12,150
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you look at the very first page where it says district attendance, and you look at 6, 7, and 8, it's 141, and 134, and 6.

1654
02:14:12,190 --> 02:14:12,390
[SPEAKER_09]: 161, 136, then 154, 157.

1655
02:14:12,490 --> 02:14:12,630
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

1656
02:14:12,790 --> 02:14:14,672
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, that is the attendance.

1657
02:14:14,752 --> 02:14:16,092
[SPEAKER_09]: That's who showed up that day, yes.

1658
02:14:31,009 --> 02:14:36,892
[SPEAKER_04]: But for the, the district knows the names of every single child that's enrolled in our school, whether they show up or not.

1659
02:14:39,013 --> 02:14:44,536
[SPEAKER_09]: What you're looking at are the children who show up every, these are the children who do show up.

1660
02:14:44,616 --> 02:14:45,457
[SPEAKER_16]: That are enrolled.

1661
02:14:45,537 --> 02:14:46,597
[SPEAKER_09]: That are enrolled, yes.

1662
02:14:46,617 --> 02:14:46,998
[SPEAKER_09]: Enrolled.

1663
02:14:49,459 --> 02:14:49,799
[SPEAKER_19]: Please.

1664
02:14:49,939 --> 02:14:51,120
[SPEAKER_19]: But, so on one day we've got 141

1665
02:14:55,839 --> 02:14:58,200
[SPEAKER_19]: sixth graders at the Andrews, and another day we have 140.

1666
02:14:59,241 --> 02:15:05,144
[SPEAKER_19]: But what we want to know is, without children being absent, how many, what is the number?

1667
02:15:06,885 --> 02:15:10,807
[SPEAKER_09]: So right now it varies still, because it fluctuates.

1668
02:15:11,948 --> 02:15:16,270
[SPEAKER_19]: But we have the, what is the maximum number that are showing up now?

1669
02:15:17,711 --> 02:15:20,793
[SPEAKER_16]: Enrollment, not attendance, enrollment.

1670
02:15:21,073 --> 02:15:24,955
[SPEAKER_19]: What is the maximum number that are enrolled at that school?

1671
02:15:25,792 --> 02:15:28,994
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't have that answer to you, the maximum number of enrollment.

1672
02:15:29,074 --> 02:15:30,675
[SPEAKER_09]: These are the children who have shown up.

1673
02:15:30,715 --> 02:15:30,835
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

1674
02:15:31,155 --> 02:15:37,479
[SPEAKER_19]: So what we need and what Paul is saying is in order to determine what we're looking at, we really

1675
02:15:38,695 --> 02:15:44,118
[SPEAKER_19]: these numbers are the snapshot of the day as opposed to the potential large picture.

1676
02:15:44,758 --> 02:15:48,580
[SPEAKER_19]: And what I understand is you're saying I can't, I don't quite have that yet.

1677
02:15:49,540 --> 02:15:58,884
[SPEAKER_19]: What we're wondering is, you know, all of a sudden we see that the sixth grade is the same and then on the next day it's not.

1678
02:15:59,245 --> 02:16:06,608
[SPEAKER_19]: So we don't know, we can't tell by this, did we lose some people who then maybe enrolled their child at a different school

1679
02:16:07,152 --> 02:16:09,253
[SPEAKER_19]: because of the issues around the sixth grade.

1680
02:16:09,574 --> 02:16:13,736
[SPEAKER_19]: So we need a follow-up report on that when we get maximum numbers.

1681
02:16:13,756 --> 02:16:14,237
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.

1682
02:16:14,257 --> 02:16:16,578
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that takes a while to do.

1683
02:16:16,598 --> 02:16:17,939
[SPEAKER_09]: I think you need to flush it out.

1684
02:16:17,999 --> 02:16:21,882
[SPEAKER_09]: I think sometimes kids show up one day and then not the next day, and that's what you see.

1685
02:16:21,902 --> 02:16:23,042
[SPEAKER_09]: But I understand what you're saying.

1686
02:16:23,122 --> 02:16:23,283
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1687
02:16:23,783 --> 02:16:24,103
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1688
02:16:24,724 --> 02:16:24,984
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

1689
02:16:25,004 --> 02:16:26,865
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1690
02:16:26,885 --> 02:16:27,145
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1691
02:16:29,747 --> 02:16:32,749
[SPEAKER_26]: Is there a motion to accept this resolution on time?

1692
02:16:32,769 --> 02:16:33,149
[SPEAKER_26]: There is.

1693
02:16:33,169 --> 02:16:33,549
[SPEAKER_26]: I had a question.

1694
02:16:33,569 --> 02:16:35,991
[SPEAKER_26]: I just wanted to know if, and it might come in the future,

1695
02:16:36,492 --> 02:16:38,393
[SPEAKER_26]: on one of the future reports.

1696
02:16:38,753 --> 02:16:55,499
[SPEAKER_26]: So under the vocational school, I wanted to know if we could get the breakdown of the number of students that are attending, the total number of students attending Minuteman, and the total number of students attending Essex Aggie, or any other vocational school.

1697
02:16:55,579 --> 02:16:56,539
[SPEAKER_26]: I was just really curious.

1698
02:16:57,079 --> 02:16:58,100
[SPEAKER_26]: We can get that for you, Ms.

1699
02:16:58,140 --> 02:16:58,380
[SPEAKER_26]: Kratz.

1700
02:16:59,046 --> 02:17:03,849
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, okay, it's coming, okay, great.

1701
02:17:04,309 --> 02:17:04,870
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, okay.

1702
02:17:04,910 --> 02:17:05,310
[SPEAKER_16]: How was that?

1703
02:17:06,471 --> 02:17:07,631
[SPEAKER_26]: Three Minuteman, two Essex.

1704
02:17:07,951 --> 02:17:13,555
[SPEAKER_26]: And do we have any students currently enrolled from Everett Public Schools at the vocational school?

1705
02:17:13,675 --> 02:17:19,418
[SPEAKER_26]: I know we had some enrollment in the past couple of years, and I was just curious if we have that.

1706
02:17:19,438 --> 02:17:21,860
[SPEAKER_16]: Nine, nine from Everett, Everett Vocational School.

1707
02:17:22,897 --> 02:17:25,479
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, okay, okay, great.

1708
02:17:25,499 --> 02:17:28,923
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, there's a motion on the floor to accept this report, place it on file.

1709
02:17:28,943 --> 02:17:30,604
[SPEAKER_16]: There's a second by Mr. Russo.

1710
02:17:30,704 --> 02:17:31,485
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

1711
02:17:31,505 --> 02:17:31,985
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

1712
02:17:32,226 --> 02:17:32,846
[SPEAKER_16]: All those opposed?

1713
02:17:32,866 --> 02:17:33,927
[SPEAKER_16]: The motion carries.

1714
02:17:34,968 --> 02:17:36,349
[SPEAKER_16]: Report on summer programs.

1715
02:17:37,050 --> 02:17:40,053
[SPEAKER_09]: So our summers are very busy at Medford Public Schools.

1716
02:17:40,233 --> 02:17:47,700
[SPEAKER_09]: Our students participated in a variety of different programs, the venues that were used.

1717
02:17:49,105 --> 02:17:50,146
[SPEAKER_09]: report on summer programs.

1718
02:17:50,166 --> 02:17:50,886
[SPEAKER_16]: Summarize, please.

1719
02:17:51,307 --> 02:17:51,947
[SPEAKER_16]: Summarize, please.

1720
02:17:52,288 --> 02:17:53,529
[SPEAKER_09]: Summarize this program.

1721
02:17:53,549 --> 02:17:58,813
[SPEAKER_09]: So we had programs with media and technology with Molly Layden.

1722
02:18:00,014 --> 02:18:04,237
[SPEAKER_09]: They went to the National Foundation, which was funded by the middle schools.

1723
02:18:05,438 --> 02:18:08,621
[SPEAKER_09]: As you all know, Anthony Petrellis runs our summer fund program.

1724
02:18:09,001 --> 02:18:11,923
[SPEAKER_09]: We had about 140 students, and that runs from 730 to 430.

1725
02:18:12,003 --> 02:18:14,265
[SPEAKER_09]: And there was a cost to that program.

1726
02:18:18,375 --> 02:18:31,386
[SPEAKER_09]: Our coordinator of special education had ESY programs that took place at the Roberts Elementary School and that's funded by the special education department.

1727
02:18:32,807 --> 02:18:41,314
[SPEAKER_09]: Our regular summer program, our summer school program was run by assistant principal David Blough and assistant director Jill Sawyer.

1728
02:18:42,135 --> 02:18:44,336
[SPEAKER_09]: And those classes ran their usual 8 to 12 and then

1729
02:18:45,535 --> 02:18:48,577
[SPEAKER_09]: from 8 to 10 and then 10 to 12.

1730
02:18:52,401 --> 02:18:56,284
[SPEAKER_09]: Our EL director, Paul Texera, offered a STARBASE STEM lab program.

1731
02:18:56,304 --> 02:19:05,491
[SPEAKER_09]: This was kind of an amazing program, I thought, from on July 16th to July 20th, from 8 to 2.30.

1732
02:19:06,252 --> 02:19:12,557
[SPEAKER_09]: And he took the students to Hanscom Air Force Base, and the EL students attended a week-long STEM

1733
02:19:13,084 --> 02:19:15,707
[SPEAKER_09]: enrichment program, so that was really fun for those students.

1734
02:19:17,028 --> 02:19:24,475
[SPEAKER_09]: Our thanks to all of the people who participated and the teachers who facilitated.

1735
02:19:24,495 --> 02:19:33,383
[SPEAKER_09]: Additionally, Paul Texera ran an EL middle school summer enrichment program from July 9th to August 7th for grades 6 through 8.

1736
02:19:36,520 --> 02:19:43,042
[SPEAKER_09]: And then Assistant Principal David Blouk supervised the high school 101 from August 20th to August 22nd.

1737
02:19:43,642 --> 02:19:46,842
[SPEAKER_09]: And once again, as you know, there was heat issues.

1738
02:19:47,403 --> 02:20:01,946
[SPEAKER_09]: There were heat issues in our schools and Dr. Vincent and I, during the summer, walked the high school to make sure the kids were well hydrated and made sure that if they needed to be moved to rooms that had air conditioning,

1739
02:20:02,420 --> 02:20:03,981
[SPEAKER_09]: We had a science lecture hall.

1740
02:20:04,801 --> 02:20:06,963
[SPEAKER_09]: The fitness center was air-conditioned.

1741
02:20:07,403 --> 02:20:11,826
[SPEAKER_09]: So we tried to make sure that the kids were staying cool, as well as swimming every single day.

1742
02:20:12,386 --> 02:20:12,626
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

1743
02:20:12,786 --> 02:20:13,227
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1744
02:20:13,247 --> 02:20:13,287
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

1745
02:20:14,567 --> 02:20:15,448
[SPEAKER_09]: Erin, are we?

1746
02:20:15,488 --> 02:20:23,693
[SPEAKER_13]: First of all, I think this is the first summer that we have had the open tuition program.

1747
02:20:25,414 --> 02:20:26,775
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, it is the first summer, yeah.

1748
02:20:29,232 --> 02:20:30,313
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a great program.

1749
02:20:30,353 --> 02:20:35,236
[SPEAKER_09]: The kids went to Hanscom Yacht Force Base and then they built, is politics era still here?

1750
02:20:35,817 --> 02:20:38,199
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, they built a, wanna come up?

1751
02:20:39,199 --> 02:20:40,420
[SPEAKER_09]: App Inventor or something?

1752
02:20:40,440 --> 02:20:45,344
[SPEAKER_13]: I knew it was an initiative.

1753
02:20:52,340 --> 02:21:01,228
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so students got to, so Starbase is a series of STEM labs at Air Force bases throughout the country.

1754
02:21:01,248 --> 02:21:04,751
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there are four of them and we have one here at Hanscom.

1755
02:21:05,472 --> 02:21:09,295
[SPEAKER_00]: So the students get to go out for a week and they

1756
02:21:10,476 --> 02:21:14,237
[SPEAKER_00]: engage in the whole engineering design process.

1757
02:21:14,937 --> 02:21:21,238
[SPEAKER_00]: They get to build pieces of the space station with a 3D laser printer.

1758
02:21:21,518 --> 02:21:23,519
[SPEAKER_00]: And each student gets a different part.

1759
02:21:23,639 --> 02:21:25,439
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually do reconstruct it.

1760
02:21:26,639 --> 02:21:30,040
[SPEAKER_00]: They have CO2 car races that they did.

1761
02:21:30,160 --> 02:21:31,460
[SPEAKER_00]: There's chemistry.

1762
02:21:31,580 --> 02:21:38,542
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all sorts of hands-on activities, focusing all on

1763
02:21:39,222 --> 02:21:41,403
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, science and STEM activities.

1764
02:21:41,663 --> 02:21:43,904
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for offering that to our EL students.

1765
02:21:43,984 --> 02:21:52,086
[SPEAKER_15]: I know it was the first year for that program, and then I heard about it, and children and families were very pleased that they had that opportunity.

1766
02:21:52,166 --> 02:21:52,546
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1767
02:21:53,607 --> 02:21:59,749
[SPEAKER_15]: My other question is, did our vocational programming offer any summer programming?

1768
02:21:59,809 --> 02:22:06,191
[SPEAKER_15]: Sometimes they do that for eighth graders to get them interested in different things coming up to the vocational school.

1769
02:22:06,491 --> 02:22:07,832
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm not sure if that happened.

1770
02:22:07,852 --> 02:22:09,012
[SPEAKER_15]: I didn't see it on this list.

1771
02:22:09,402 --> 02:22:13,364
[SPEAKER_15]: But I believe in years past that those programs were offered.

1772
02:22:13,744 --> 02:22:19,768
[SPEAKER_15]: So maybe we could get an update on that and find out if that was offered this year.

1773
02:22:19,788 --> 02:22:20,168
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Ms.

1774
02:22:20,208 --> 02:22:22,349
[SPEAKER_09]: Sawyer did offer something during the summer.

1775
02:22:22,369 --> 02:22:23,930
[SPEAKER_09]: It was at the very beginning of the summer.

1776
02:22:23,950 --> 02:22:26,472
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll see if I can get an update.

1777
02:22:26,992 --> 02:22:29,573
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just curious how many students are taking place.

1778
02:22:30,394 --> 02:22:33,155
[SPEAKER_16]: You said it was offered, but we can get a detailed report.

1779
02:22:33,375 --> 02:22:34,596
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I appreciate that.

1780
02:22:34,836 --> 02:22:35,236
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1781
02:22:35,517 --> 02:22:36,457
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion to approve.

1782
02:22:36,677 --> 02:22:37,258
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Diane.

1783
02:22:37,618 --> 02:22:37,978
[SPEAKER_16]: You're welcome.

1784
02:22:38,618 --> 02:22:38,838
[SPEAKER_16]: Ms.

1785
02:22:38,858 --> 02:22:40,259
[SPEAKER_16]: Van de Kloot, you're set.

1786
02:22:40,679 --> 02:22:41,119
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1787
02:22:43,359 --> 02:22:48,321
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion to accept this report and place it on file by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Ms.

1788
02:22:48,361 --> 02:22:48,801
[SPEAKER_16]: Van de Kloot.

1789
02:22:48,881 --> 02:22:49,481
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

1790
02:22:49,501 --> 02:22:49,561
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

1791
02:22:50,322 --> 02:22:50,902
[SPEAKER_16]: All those opposed?

1792
02:22:50,962 --> 02:22:51,642
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion passes.

1793
02:22:52,982 --> 02:22:54,923
[SPEAKER_16]: Report on new teacher induction.

1794
02:23:01,599 --> 02:23:07,644
[SPEAKER_07]: Good evening, Superintendent Edward Vincent, Mayor Burke, and members of the Medford School Committee.

1795
02:23:08,125 --> 02:23:11,407
[SPEAKER_07]: So I am here tonight to talk about what I think is a really exciting program.

1796
02:23:11,808 --> 02:23:18,433
[SPEAKER_07]: I love working with new teachers, and this year I was able to coordinate the new teacher induction program.

1797
02:23:18,874 --> 02:23:21,876
[SPEAKER_07]: I will make this brief, I know you have the report in front of you.

1798
02:23:22,757 --> 02:23:28,762
[SPEAKER_07]: So this program was really designed to introduce our newest educators to the district's policies, procedures,

1799
02:23:30,101 --> 02:23:45,788
[SPEAKER_07]: to familiarize them with the district curricular programs and technological applications, and most importantly, I think, to acclimate them to Medford as a caring, educational partnership of school, family, and community.

1800
02:23:47,109 --> 02:23:48,529
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was a four-day program.

1801
02:23:49,470 --> 02:23:51,510
[SPEAKER_07]: On the first day, we did introductions.

1802
02:23:52,431 --> 02:23:54,832
[SPEAKER_07]: So we introduced the central administrators.

1803
02:23:55,450 --> 02:24:14,378
[SPEAKER_07]: many of the administrators for the departments, teachers engaged in technology workshops, the Medford Teachers Association met with the teachers, treated them to a really nice lunch, and at the end of that day, teachers went through a professional protocol and dress for success workshop.

1804
02:24:15,658 --> 02:24:24,642
[SPEAKER_07]: On the second day of the training for new teachers, teachers went to an ASOP, Frontline Attendance Management System workshop,

1805
02:24:25,356 --> 02:24:27,777
[SPEAKER_07]: an educator evaluation workshop.

1806
02:24:28,537 --> 02:24:33,859
[SPEAKER_07]: They had lunch, and then they met with their curriculum directors and principals in the afternoon.

1807
02:24:34,720 --> 02:24:51,346
[SPEAKER_07]: On the third day, they went to best practices workshop, specific to math and English, and they also went to workshop on best practices in how to teach students in the most effective way.

1808
02:24:53,067 --> 02:24:54,107
[SPEAKER_07]: They were treated to a lunch.

1809
02:24:54,849 --> 02:24:56,975
[SPEAKER_07]: sponsored by the district in the Bistro.

1810
02:24:57,978 --> 02:25:02,852
[SPEAKER_07]: They met with their mentor teachers and they had discussions with their mentor teachers.

1811
02:25:03,433 --> 02:25:25,000
[SPEAKER_07]: The afternoon, they were treated, I will say, to a yoga meditation instructional strategy workshop, a social emotional district initiative workshop, and then lastly, at the end of that third day, I talked to them about the program and got some valuable feedback from them.

1812
02:25:25,840 --> 02:25:29,561
[SPEAKER_07]: They additionally filled out a survey, which I've collected the responses.

1813
02:25:30,181 --> 02:25:32,582
[SPEAKER_07]: The fourth day, the last day of the

1814
02:25:33,362 --> 02:25:36,464
[SPEAKER_07]: of the induction week, this year we changed around a little bit.

1815
02:25:36,744 --> 02:25:38,785
[SPEAKER_07]: We gave them a lot of time in their classroom.

1816
02:25:39,246 --> 02:25:48,632
[SPEAKER_07]: They had asked for that last year and feedback that I've received from many of them indicates that they really appreciated that.

1817
02:25:49,392 --> 02:25:59,098
[SPEAKER_07]: You can imagine that you're coming on as a new educator, you wanna get ready, you've heard all these workshops and that's great, but really they wanted to get into their classroom.

1818
02:25:59,738 --> 02:26:02,140
[SPEAKER_07]: So again, I do think they appreciated it

1819
02:26:02,718 --> 02:26:04,879
[SPEAKER_07]: So again, it's one of my favorite things to do.

1820
02:26:05,020 --> 02:26:10,864
[SPEAKER_07]: I love introducing new teachers to the district, and we had a great team.

1821
02:26:11,004 --> 02:26:12,224
[SPEAKER_07]: I did not do it alone.

1822
02:26:12,625 --> 02:26:22,091
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to really give a shout out to Donna Lasky, who is the mentor coordinator, along with all of the other administrators in the district, because we really work together on this.

1823
02:26:22,752 --> 02:26:25,774
[SPEAKER_07]: I would be happy to take any questions if you have them.

1824
02:26:27,015 --> 02:26:28,416
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much, Ms.

1825
02:26:28,436 --> 02:26:28,956
[SPEAKER_16]: Riccadeli.

1826
02:26:28,996 --> 02:26:29,436
[SPEAKER_16]: You're welcome.

1827
02:26:29,556 --> 02:26:31,438
[SPEAKER_16]: And thank you for all your hard work this summer as well.

1828
02:26:31,478 --> 02:26:31,918
[SPEAKER_16]: You're welcome.

1829
02:26:33,146 --> 02:26:37,629
[SPEAKER_16]: On the motion to place this report on file by Mr. Giro, seconded by Ms.

1830
02:26:37,769 --> 02:26:38,589
[SPEAKER_16]: Kurtz, I believe.

1831
02:26:39,090 --> 02:26:39,930
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

1832
02:26:40,771 --> 02:26:41,531
[SPEAKER_16]: All those opposed?

1833
02:26:41,751 --> 02:26:42,592
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion carries.

1834
02:26:43,112 --> 02:26:44,933
[SPEAKER_16]: Report on transportation.

1835
02:26:45,133 --> 02:26:45,734
[SPEAKER_16]: Good evening.

1836
02:26:45,794 --> 02:26:47,835
[SPEAKER_16]: I have the last four remaining items.

1837
02:26:47,895 --> 02:26:50,877
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's hope we can get through these fairly quickly.

1838
02:26:52,058 --> 02:26:53,479
[SPEAKER_08]: Transportation summary.

1839
02:26:53,899 --> 02:27:00,443
[SPEAKER_08]: We are in the first year of an extended contract here with our Eastern Yellow Bus Company.

1840
02:27:00,988 --> 02:27:06,075
[SPEAKER_08]: We did have to go back to the 18 routes as we experienced last year with our newcomers program.

1841
02:27:07,037 --> 02:27:11,603
[SPEAKER_08]: We are transporting all of our public schools as well as St.

1842
02:27:11,643 --> 02:27:12,985
[SPEAKER_08]: Joseph Catholic and St.

1843
02:27:13,025 --> 02:27:14,207
[SPEAKER_08]: Raphael Catholic schools.

1844
02:27:15,588 --> 02:27:21,833
[SPEAKER_08]: We do have reduced ridership for Minuteman Vocational, which we just expressed is down to three students.

1845
02:27:22,613 --> 02:27:30,599
[SPEAKER_08]: And we are looking at transitioning the newcomers.

1846
02:27:30,679 --> 02:27:35,183
[SPEAKER_08]: We continue to establish new routes for them as they come into the district.

1847
02:27:36,244 --> 02:27:41,828
[SPEAKER_08]: The high school bus run was supplemented this year with two additional buses to help offset the MBTA.

1848
02:27:42,365 --> 02:27:46,867
[SPEAKER_08]: It is still on summer break when we start before the Labor Day holiday.

1849
02:27:47,387 --> 02:27:55,991
[SPEAKER_08]: So surprisingly, I know it may not seem this way, but there were fewer issues and calls that we experienced last year.

1850
02:27:56,051 --> 02:28:01,914
[SPEAKER_08]: So I consider it a very successful start to the busing schedule and situation.

1851
02:28:02,434 --> 02:28:10,258
[SPEAKER_08]: The bus routes that were provided in your packet have already since been updated and will be changed next week as well.

1852
02:28:10,732 --> 02:28:24,143
[SPEAKER_08]: due to the kindergartners ridership and some overcrowding issues that we are addressing and we'll be changing some stops on mainly the elementary levels and getting the overflow ridership addressed on that.

1853
02:28:24,223 --> 02:28:32,170
[SPEAKER_08]: So we are aware of that and work continuously to adjust these stops as we are able to accommodate that.

1854
02:28:34,704 --> 02:28:40,849
[SPEAKER_16]: I particularly want to thank you for providing those buses for the pre-labor-day drive.

1855
02:28:41,069 --> 02:28:43,631
[SPEAKER_16]: That was such an issue.

1856
02:28:52,882 --> 02:28:56,503
[SPEAKER_19]: last year, and I'm glad you were proactive and not a phone call.

1857
02:28:56,623 --> 02:28:57,243
[SPEAKER_19]: Absolutely.

1858
02:28:57,363 --> 02:28:57,944
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1859
02:28:58,024 --> 02:28:58,464
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1860
02:28:59,264 --> 02:28:59,624
[SPEAKER_16]: Ms.

1861
02:28:59,644 --> 02:29:00,184
[SPEAKER_16]: DiBenedetto.

1862
02:29:00,384 --> 02:29:00,744
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1863
02:29:01,004 --> 02:29:01,985
[SPEAKER_15]: I did get one call.

1864
02:29:02,885 --> 02:29:03,805
[SPEAKER_15]: It was only one call.

1865
02:29:03,845 --> 02:29:12,528
[SPEAKER_15]: It's two students that are on one side of the street, and the bus goes around very far to pick them up rather than letting the students cross the street.

1866
02:29:12,548 --> 02:29:14,948
[SPEAKER_15]: It's up near Grove or Salt and Saw.

1867
02:29:14,988 --> 02:29:16,129
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know that area very well.

1868
02:29:16,149 --> 02:29:16,769
[SPEAKER_14]: It's for safety.

1869
02:29:17,589 --> 02:29:19,009
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sure it's a safety issue.

1870
02:29:19,149 --> 02:29:21,190
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if they've talked to you directly about it.

1871
02:29:21,509 --> 02:29:26,952
[SPEAKER_15]: Other than that, it's a great start because usually I get a lot of calls or emails.

1872
02:29:27,393 --> 02:29:31,095
[SPEAKER_15]: If they were to speak with you, maybe there was some way that we could look at that.

1873
02:29:31,115 --> 02:29:34,057
[SPEAKER_08]: We look at every request in terms of safety.

1874
02:29:34,157 --> 02:29:42,342
[SPEAKER_15]: And my other question is the late bus that the Columbus School, because they had the, I know we added it at the end of last year.

1875
02:29:42,362 --> 02:29:47,265
[SPEAKER_15]: I just want to make sure that those students have that opportunity again this year.

1876
02:29:47,305 --> 02:29:48,746
[SPEAKER_15]: Remember they were staying late?

1877
02:29:48,806 --> 02:29:50,247
[SPEAKER_15]: That was a special program?

1878
02:29:51,138 --> 02:29:55,540
[SPEAKER_08]: for an eight-week session that was not identified as going school year-round.

1879
02:29:55,580 --> 02:30:07,704
[SPEAKER_08]: We've adjusted for some additional math intervention programs that are outside of that particular scope, so we have not identified a late run for that particular program.

1880
02:30:08,344 --> 02:30:09,064
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1881
02:30:09,324 --> 02:30:14,906
[SPEAKER_15]: I thought it met a couple different needs over there, but if it does arise, we'll talk about it again.

1882
02:30:15,006 --> 02:30:15,346
[SPEAKER_15]: Absolutely.

1883
02:30:15,406 --> 02:30:15,786
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1884
02:30:18,178 --> 02:30:30,663
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, I just wanted to say, you know, thank you very much for putting the information in the paper as well, the bus schedule and the blog and, you know, sharing everything on the MPS Advantage.

1885
02:30:30,743 --> 02:30:31,783
[SPEAKER_26]: And it was just great.

1886
02:30:31,903 --> 02:30:39,346
[SPEAKER_26]: And, you know, I only got one inquiry, and it was a bus was late going to the Roberts, and I heard back from Christine right away.

1887
02:30:39,366 --> 02:30:40,886
[SPEAKER_26]: And that was it.

1888
02:30:41,146 --> 02:30:42,487
[SPEAKER_26]: I didn't get any calls about the

1889
02:30:42,810 --> 02:30:43,410
[SPEAKER_26]: high school bus.

1890
02:30:43,470 --> 02:30:48,253
[SPEAKER_26]: I was waiting all day, but I, you know, it was in the paper and I took the paper with me to work.

1891
02:30:49,473 --> 02:30:50,654
[SPEAKER_18]: But thank you very much.

1892
02:30:50,794 --> 02:30:51,034
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

1893
02:30:51,114 --> 02:30:52,195
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1894
02:30:52,535 --> 02:30:55,297
[SPEAKER_18]: I just want to inform the Roberts parents.

1895
02:30:55,337 --> 02:30:58,138
[SPEAKER_18]: So the number one bus at the Roberts is overcrowded.

1896
02:30:58,758 --> 02:31:11,445
[SPEAKER_18]: Unfortunately with the kindergarten added on today, there was a very overloaded bus that three of my own children ward, but Christine is working with Tatiana from the bus company and Mr. O'Brien, the Roberts vice principals working as well.

1897
02:31:11,902 --> 02:31:12,883
[SPEAKER_18]: So that will be addressed.

1898
02:31:12,903 --> 02:31:15,544
[SPEAKER_18]: So for parents who are concerned, it is being worked on.

1899
02:31:15,944 --> 02:31:16,304
[SPEAKER_18]: Correct.

1900
02:31:16,344 --> 02:31:18,205
[SPEAKER_18]: And by next Monday, it should be evened out.

1901
02:31:18,486 --> 02:31:18,886
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1902
02:31:18,906 --> 02:31:19,326
[SPEAKER_16]: Very good.

1903
02:31:19,526 --> 02:31:20,667
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much, Ms.

1904
02:31:21,007 --> 02:31:21,447
[SPEAKER_16]: Patterson.

1905
02:31:22,028 --> 02:31:25,109
[SPEAKER_16]: Is there a motion to accept this report and place it on file?

1906
02:31:25,129 --> 02:31:26,450
[SPEAKER_16]: Is there a parent that would like to speak?

1907
02:31:28,271 --> 02:31:28,591
[SPEAKER_16]: Certainly.

1908
02:31:28,631 --> 02:31:29,151
[SPEAKER_05]: Step forward.

1909
02:31:29,171 --> 02:31:30,452
[SPEAKER_05]: Your name and address, please.

1910
02:31:30,592 --> 02:31:30,852
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

1911
02:31:30,872 --> 02:31:32,633
[SPEAKER_05]: Viviana Perdomo, Washington Street.

1912
02:31:32,913 --> 02:31:33,954
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been saying this for a while.

1913
02:31:33,974 --> 02:31:35,075
[SPEAKER_05]: You can step up to the mic.

1914
02:31:35,295 --> 02:31:35,535
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

1915
02:31:35,635 --> 02:31:41,198
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been saying this for a while regarding Hadley Place and Salem Street.

1916
02:31:43,068 --> 02:31:47,930
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if anybody ever looked at that area, but it's definitely a safety issue.

1917
02:31:49,850 --> 02:32:10,659
[SPEAKER_06]: When the winter comes, the streets on the other side are never plowed right, and a lot of my kids have to come from Washington Street, walk all the way from Hadley Street to get there, and then when they come home, they have to cross that intersection, and I don't know if you guys passed by there, but there's Brookline Bank,

1918
02:32:11,288 --> 02:32:15,451
[SPEAKER_06]: in the fireplace plays and it's like huge.

1919
02:32:16,072 --> 02:32:33,485
[SPEAKER_06]: And a lot of the times you'll see cars try to pass by the bus because they think that they can do it or they will take a right turn on Hadley Place to Salem Street going towards the new Target now.

1920
02:32:34,706 --> 02:32:38,148
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's always an issue there.

1921
02:32:39,743 --> 02:32:46,327
[SPEAKER_06]: even though you do a great job, I think that's one of the areas that really does need to be looked at.

1922
02:32:46,587 --> 02:32:47,127
[SPEAKER_16]: Absolutely.

1923
02:32:50,069 --> 02:32:52,491
[SPEAKER_06]: Which bus route is this for?

1924
02:32:52,551 --> 02:32:54,031
[SPEAKER_06]: McGlynn, the McGlynn.

1925
02:32:54,111 --> 02:32:54,612
[SPEAKER_06]: Middle school?

1926
02:32:55,252 --> 02:32:55,893
[SPEAKER_06]: No, elementary.

1927
02:32:58,094 --> 02:32:58,654
[SPEAKER_06]: It's number nine.

1928
02:32:58,794 --> 02:33:00,015
[SPEAKER_18]: Can you just talk about safety?

1929
02:33:01,256 --> 02:33:04,958
[SPEAKER_18]: I noticed that recently a crossing was hit.

1930
02:33:05,491 --> 02:33:13,432
[SPEAKER_18]: and it was school dismissal time, and I do think that I... Not at Medford, sorry, not at Medford, another city.

1931
02:33:14,513 --> 02:33:25,194
[SPEAKER_18]: But even up with us on Highland Ave, and on our intersection of Highland Ave and Sturges, a number of times the bus will be stopped, he'll have the stop sign, and cars will pass while kids are getting out.

1932
02:33:25,214 --> 02:33:33,296
[SPEAKER_06]: I do have to say that the bus driver tries to do his best to actually angle the bus, but it doesn't matter, those people don't care.

1933
02:33:33,316 --> 02:33:33,636
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't.

1934
02:33:35,438 --> 02:33:55,285
[SPEAKER_06]: During the season when the snow is this high, it's really hard for kids who live on the side streets, not even just Washington, but the side streets that go into that Hadley-Salem Street area to get to because they have to climb mountains.

1935
02:33:55,785 --> 02:34:01,667
[SPEAKER_06]: Because the city plowers will make corners of pile

1936
02:34:02,188 --> 02:34:06,312
[SPEAKER_06]: that make it so hard for people to make a sidewalk.

1937
02:34:06,713 --> 02:34:14,300
[SPEAKER_18]: But I know in the past that this has come up, not at your intersection, and that the DPW has gone and removed mounds of snow from a bus stop.

1938
02:34:14,360 --> 02:34:15,982
[SPEAKER_18]: So if you give us the heads up.

1939
02:34:16,002 --> 02:34:18,805
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, but it's not just the bus stop itself.

1940
02:34:18,885 --> 02:34:23,750
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the whole getting from the bus stop to getting home.

1941
02:34:24,665 --> 02:34:26,486
[SPEAKER_16]: Could I ask Kirsten just one question?

1942
02:34:26,506 --> 02:34:29,349
[SPEAKER_16]: Are the buses equipped with cameras now?

1943
02:34:29,369 --> 02:34:36,074
[SPEAKER_16]: If someone, right, but if a car goes by and they at least drop signs, can they see that?

1944
02:34:36,774 --> 02:34:38,356
[SPEAKER_16]: They don't have to read it for the plates?

1945
02:34:38,456 --> 02:34:40,998
[SPEAKER_06]: If they're going to the right, they're not gonna see it.

1946
02:34:41,158 --> 02:34:50,925
[SPEAKER_06]: So sometimes, when my kids were, you know, as a parent, you kind of stand in the middle and hopefully not get hit.

1947
02:34:51,366 --> 02:34:53,567
[SPEAKER_18]: And even in the past, parents have had,

1948
02:34:54,703 --> 02:35:09,032
[SPEAKER_18]: parents who have had concern, the police has sent someone for a few days, because a lot of times it's a regular commuter that is passing the bus, and the police presence has slowed people down to respect the bus rules.

1949
02:35:09,573 --> 02:35:14,316
[SPEAKER_18]: So maybe that's another, maybe the police department could look at Hadley Place in Salem.

1950
02:35:15,276 --> 02:35:16,177
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, it's one of those.

1951
02:35:16,437 --> 02:35:23,742
[SPEAKER_16]: Or if you could talk to Tatiana to see if any of the bus drivers are on different routes even, are having issues like that, to keep us informed.

1952
02:35:25,116 --> 02:35:25,456
[SPEAKER_16]: Very good.

1953
02:35:25,516 --> 02:35:25,876
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1954
02:35:26,676 --> 02:35:30,337
[SPEAKER_15]: Move the bus stop up or down a street?

1955
02:35:31,538 --> 02:35:33,318
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll review all the options on that.

1956
02:35:33,818 --> 02:35:34,238
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1957
02:35:34,718 --> 02:35:35,018
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1958
02:35:35,458 --> 02:35:35,878
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1959
02:35:35,898 --> 02:35:40,079
[SPEAKER_16]: Is there a motion to accept this report and place it on file by Mr. Rosario, seconded by Ms.

1960
02:35:40,119 --> 02:35:40,620
[SPEAKER_16]: McStone?

1961
02:35:40,680 --> 02:35:41,340
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

1962
02:35:41,360 --> 02:35:42,600
[SPEAKER_16]: All those opposed?

1963
02:35:42,640 --> 02:35:43,400
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion passes.

1964
02:35:43,780 --> 02:35:45,141
[SPEAKER_16]: Report on personnel updates.

1965
02:35:46,201 --> 02:35:46,601
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1966
02:35:46,641 --> 02:35:51,142
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is just a brief summary to inform you that we have hired a

1967
02:35:52,118 --> 02:35:54,199
[SPEAKER_08]: human resource coordinator, Kate Green.

1968
02:35:54,599 --> 02:35:56,159
[SPEAKER_08]: She started August 20th.

1969
02:35:56,259 --> 02:36:10,203
[SPEAKER_08]: We were without a person during a very heavy time of transition and influx of exiting employees and onboarding.

1970
02:36:10,303 --> 02:36:16,825
[SPEAKER_08]: So the central office, business office, has done quite a phenomenal job of maintaining

1971
02:36:17,218 --> 02:36:27,846
[SPEAKER_08]: and getting everybody on payroll as quickly as possible, getting all the query checks in, getting all the paperwork in place, maintaining all of the process that's needed to keep everybody going.

1972
02:36:27,906 --> 02:36:36,473
[SPEAKER_08]: So I wanted to certainly share that it is very valuable to now have a human resource coordinator back in this role.

1973
02:36:37,073 --> 02:36:44,139
[SPEAKER_08]: She has 14 years experience in human resources and is very decorated in her education background.

1974
02:36:44,859 --> 02:36:46,961
[SPEAKER_08]: The summary for our personnel transactions

1975
02:36:47,934 --> 02:36:50,675
[SPEAKER_08]: to date, which includes just the summer months.

1976
02:36:50,735 --> 02:36:53,676
[SPEAKER_08]: We've had over 148 different personnel transactions.

1977
02:36:54,096 --> 02:37:07,261
[SPEAKER_08]: That includes our new hires, rehires, transfers, meaning transfer from one building to another or one grade level to another that has to go through budget checks and verification for multiple steps.

1978
02:37:07,321 --> 02:37:09,122
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not just one step.

1979
02:37:09,182 --> 02:37:11,203
[SPEAKER_08]: We have to update every single system.

1980
02:37:11,223 --> 02:37:12,563
[SPEAKER_08]: So you've heard about school brains.

1981
02:37:12,623 --> 02:37:14,524
[SPEAKER_08]: We have to update the personnel.

1982
02:37:15,018 --> 02:37:17,119
[SPEAKER_08]: that's tied to that particular building.

1983
02:37:17,139 --> 02:37:22,263
[SPEAKER_08]: We have to update the ASAP, the absence reporting, so that they're listed within the correct building.

1984
02:37:22,803 --> 02:37:28,526
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's a myriad of items that have to be done for each transaction.

1985
02:37:29,207 --> 02:37:33,950
[SPEAKER_08]: We do have seven that are current on full year leaves of absences.

1986
02:37:34,370 --> 02:37:43,796
[SPEAKER_08]: We do have additional leaves of absences coming up, many maternity leaves this year, partial year, but they are significant and numerous this year.

1987
02:37:44,384 --> 02:37:51,406
[SPEAKER_08]: and we had processed 25 resignations and retirements to date, and that is for the school year 18-19.

1988
02:37:51,606 --> 02:37:56,288
[SPEAKER_08]: That is not including those that were covered in the June 30th count as well.

1989
02:37:56,608 --> 02:38:02,570
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is just to give you a general summary of what we have done over the course of the summer in this regard.

1990
02:38:03,570 --> 02:38:04,310
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much.

1991
02:38:04,330 --> 02:38:05,891
[SPEAKER_16]: A motion by Ms.

1992
02:38:05,911 --> 02:38:08,272
[SPEAKER_16]: Mustone to receive and place on file, seconded by Ms.

1993
02:38:08,352 --> 02:38:08,652
[SPEAKER_16]: Kretz.

1994
02:38:08,712 --> 02:38:09,412
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

1995
02:38:09,432 --> 02:38:10,212
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

1996
02:38:10,232 --> 02:38:10,753
[SPEAKER_16]: All those opposed?

1997
02:38:10,813 --> 02:38:11,593
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion carries.

1998
02:38:12,745 --> 02:38:13,085
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1999
02:38:13,105 --> 02:38:21,048
[SPEAKER_08]: The next item that we have is a request for approval of a scholarship in the name of Sarah Palumbo.

2000
02:38:21,128 --> 02:38:31,611
[SPEAKER_08]: This is for the Curtis Tufts School and to be established at a $500 annual scholarship for a promising graduating senior.

2001
02:38:32,051 --> 02:38:40,094
[SPEAKER_08]: The student shall be going to any community college, university, or track or trade school, and somebody that is notable

2002
02:38:41,008 --> 02:38:43,429
[SPEAKER_08]: for post-high school involvement.

2003
02:38:43,850 --> 02:38:49,012
[SPEAKER_08]: So we would respectfully request approval for this scholarship going forward.

2004
02:38:52,313 --> 02:38:55,135
[SPEAKER_16]: On the motion to receive in places, oh, I'm sorry, Ms.

2005
02:38:55,555 --> 02:38:56,275
[SPEAKER_15]: DiBenedetto.

2006
02:38:56,355 --> 02:38:56,695
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

2007
02:38:58,176 --> 02:39:07,841
[SPEAKER_15]: I was gonna motion to accept it, but my colleagues already have, but could we also send a letter of thank you to the Palumbo family for this kind donation

2008
02:39:10,149 --> 02:39:12,691
[SPEAKER_15]: It looks like it's going to continue for years to come.

2009
02:39:13,712 --> 02:39:15,955
[SPEAKER_16]: Definitely, thank the Plumville family.

2010
02:39:16,475 --> 02:39:20,059
[SPEAKER_16]: And there's a motion on the floor to accept this scholarship fund.

2011
02:39:20,819 --> 02:39:21,940
[SPEAKER_16]: Is there a second by Ms.

2012
02:39:21,960 --> 02:39:22,421
[SPEAKER_16]: Vander Kloot?

2013
02:39:22,461 --> 02:39:23,222
[SPEAKER_16]: Roll call vote, please.

2014
02:39:23,242 --> 02:39:29,628
[SPEAKER_11]: Mrs. DeVette?

2015
02:39:29,688 --> 02:39:29,788
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

2016
02:39:29,808 --> 02:39:30,749
[SPEAKER_13]: Mrs. Vander Kloot?

2017
02:39:30,789 --> 02:39:30,889
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

2018
02:39:39,883 --> 02:39:41,904
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

2019
02:39:41,964 --> 02:39:44,265
[SPEAKER_16]: The motion passes and the scholarship is accepted.

2020
02:39:44,426 --> 02:39:45,046
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2021
02:39:45,366 --> 02:39:48,548
[SPEAKER_16]: And the next is to accept a donation from Impact Church.

2022
02:39:48,968 --> 02:39:49,388
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

2023
02:39:49,448 --> 02:39:55,432
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, just a brief summary that we did meet with many of our renters over the course of the summer.

2024
02:39:56,192 --> 02:40:05,698
[SPEAKER_08]: And when we did happen to meet with Pastor Zenzo Motoga, it was discussed that he and his church would like to make a donation to the schools.

2025
02:40:06,297 --> 02:40:15,985
[SPEAKER_08]: They had identified an amount in which we have confirmed for $10,000, which we would like to get approval for acceptance.

2026
02:40:17,247 --> 02:40:29,177
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, we had previously received large donations from Staples for paper and other supplies throughout the schools that is no longer available through that resource.

2027
02:40:29,627 --> 02:40:36,651
[SPEAKER_08]: So this type of generous donation would be very helpful in filling that void at this point in time.

2028
02:40:37,392 --> 02:40:37,812
[SPEAKER_16]: Very good.

2029
02:40:37,832 --> 02:40:38,172
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2030
02:40:38,212 --> 02:40:43,095
[SPEAKER_16]: And again, thank you to the pastor and his church.

2031
02:40:43,436 --> 02:40:47,618
[SPEAKER_15]: And there's no conflict since they are a renter of that particular school, right?

2032
02:40:48,239 --> 02:40:48,299
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

2033
02:40:48,319 --> 02:40:48,559
[SPEAKER_15]: OK.

2034
02:40:48,819 --> 02:40:49,820
[SPEAKER_15]: I just wanted to check that.

2035
02:40:50,220 --> 02:40:57,364
[SPEAKER_15]: And is this just specifically for the McGlynn, or is it for the district as a whole?

2036
02:40:57,505 --> 02:40:58,085
[SPEAKER_15]: The district.

2037
02:40:59,352 --> 02:41:01,333
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, motion to approve and letter sent.

2038
02:41:01,513 --> 02:41:04,295
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a motion to approve by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Ms.

2039
02:41:04,335 --> 02:41:04,775
[SPEAKER_16]: Vanderkle.

2040
02:41:04,835 --> 02:41:07,356
[SPEAKER_16]: Roll call vote, please, on the acceptance of this donation.

2041
02:41:10,658 --> 02:41:10,918
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

2042
02:41:21,504 --> 02:41:24,166
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

2043
02:41:24,386 --> 02:41:25,246
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much, Ms.

2044
02:41:25,266 --> 02:41:25,627
[SPEAKER_16]: Patterson.

2045
02:41:28,906 --> 02:41:29,486
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Russo.

2046
02:41:29,987 --> 02:41:32,608
[SPEAKER_04]: Question about school supplies.

2047
02:41:34,949 --> 02:41:41,793
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it something anybody's considered to perhaps do a school system store?

2048
02:41:43,714 --> 02:41:47,897
[SPEAKER_04]: Just for one class for my son, it was $48 in supplies.

2049
02:41:49,978 --> 02:41:54,000
[SPEAKER_04]: And I went to Staples to buy it, and I was like, hey.

2050
02:41:54,280 --> 02:41:57,062
[SPEAKER_04]: I was so irritated.

2051
02:41:57,982 --> 02:42:06,686
[SPEAKER_04]: at the cost, and so I went up to the front desk and I talked to a manager and I'm like, you know, if we had a corporate staples account, what's the discount?

2052
02:42:06,706 --> 02:42:08,066
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're like, it could be up to 40%.

2053
02:42:08,427 --> 02:42:13,549
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, there are like, how many parents are spending 48 bucks per class?

2054
02:42:14,589 --> 02:42:23,933
[SPEAKER_04]: And if the school system can buy in bulk, even if we're not gonna just give it away, just resell it at a huge discount.

2055
02:42:24,013 --> 02:42:25,374
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's a lot of money.

2056
02:42:26,290 --> 02:42:33,895
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know if other schools do anything like that, but it just seemed kind of absurd to be spending that.

2057
02:42:34,135 --> 02:42:43,460
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I saw all these families with their carts filled to the brim with $15 three-inch binders, the mandatory ones the teachers ask for.

2058
02:42:47,743 --> 02:42:51,845
[SPEAKER_19]: So for a while, PTOs, there was a period of time

2059
02:42:52,268 --> 02:43:01,151
[SPEAKER_19]: when different school PTOs did in fact take some of that on and were buying in bulk and coordinating the supplies.

2060
02:43:02,191 --> 02:43:03,171
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, it's one of those things.

2061
02:43:03,231 --> 02:43:04,832
[SPEAKER_19]: It takes a lot of effort and time.

2062
02:43:04,912 --> 02:43:11,534
[SPEAKER_19]: So you have a parent who's revved up about it and it lasts for a couple of years and then kind of falls by the wayside.

2063
02:43:11,574 --> 02:43:18,136
[SPEAKER_19]: It's certainly beneficial, but it is a, you know, it's just one more thing of organizing.

2064
02:43:19,016 --> 02:43:20,937
[SPEAKER_19]: But that isn't to say that it isn't worth trying to do.

2065
02:43:23,618 --> 02:43:24,879
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Benedetto.

2066
02:43:25,479 --> 02:43:34,984
[SPEAKER_15]: Our vocational program has a retail program, so why couldn't we look at that as being part of their programming?

2067
02:43:35,524 --> 02:43:37,024
[SPEAKER_15]: The DECA program, the DECA?

2068
02:43:37,465 --> 02:43:39,746
[SPEAKER_15]: Like the marketing and retail, don't we have?

2069
02:43:39,766 --> 02:43:42,507
[SPEAKER_16]: They sell like sweatshirts, that kind of stuff?

2070
02:43:42,547 --> 02:43:51,351
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, and why can't they sell, why can't we order the school supplies in a similar way and open that up, you know, certain hours?

2071
02:43:53,221 --> 02:43:54,201
[SPEAKER_15]: at the beginning of the school year.

2072
02:43:54,521 --> 02:43:56,942
[SPEAKER_16]: Lower level, knowing exactly what the lists are.

2073
02:43:57,082 --> 02:44:01,364
[SPEAKER_16]: So PTO seemed like that would be the right avenue.

2074
02:44:05,085 --> 02:44:20,570
[SPEAKER_15]: I thought that the vocational school, they sell things at a lower level, but there are also kids in that program all the way up through 12th grade that, you know, ordering those supplies and giving them those life skills to manage a situation in that

2075
02:44:20,960 --> 02:44:22,441
[SPEAKER_15]: might be worth looking at.

2076
02:44:22,901 --> 02:44:24,462
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, that's what we're hoping to do.

2077
02:44:24,542 --> 02:44:29,944
[SPEAKER_15]: And this is a real-life practice gum, and it would be supervised by that shop.

2078
02:44:31,305 --> 02:44:39,689
[SPEAKER_15]: So I don't see why not at least discuss that as a possibility with Chad, the director there, and just look at it.

2079
02:44:40,389 --> 02:44:48,153
[SPEAKER_09]: We can look at that, but there's a sheer volume you're talking about for the kiddos to have to get together and make.

2080
02:44:49,198 --> 02:44:52,641
[SPEAKER_09]: they have to actually buy the supplies and put them together.

2081
02:44:52,741 --> 02:44:57,044
[SPEAKER_09]: So we can talk to Mr. Fallon about that, but it would be a huge undertaking.

2082
02:44:57,604 --> 02:45:07,752
[SPEAKER_15]: Even if we start small and then grow it, at least we're offering, like, hey, get all your notebooks here instead of at Staples, or all your binders, and just start small and then grow it.

2083
02:45:07,872 --> 02:45:10,674
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, it's a life lesson for students.

2084
02:45:11,374 --> 02:45:15,317
[SPEAKER_15]: Our student advocate is here, and we would like to speak.

2085
02:45:17,203 --> 02:45:37,374
[SPEAKER_21]: But if you sell things like a geneticist's bagel, like a steak, or some sneakers, or some Texas, or anything like that, where do you think that would happen?

2086
02:45:56,871 --> 02:46:05,915
[SPEAKER_15]: You could even set up shop at a different spot seasonally.

2087
02:46:06,636 --> 02:46:09,437
[SPEAKER_15]: They set up kiosks and malls.

2088
02:46:10,418 --> 02:46:19,522
[SPEAKER_15]: Space isn't, I don't think, prohibitive of at least looking at the idea of this in some way.

2089
02:46:19,918 --> 02:46:29,943
[SPEAKER_15]: even if it's a small way that we can help our community and serve the need of our community in their wallets and teach our students at the same time.

2090
02:46:30,043 --> 02:46:40,568
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's a growth opportunity that at least should be looked at by the people in that, you know, by the principal of that area.

2091
02:46:41,268 --> 02:46:41,428
[SPEAKER_16]: Ms.

2092
02:46:41,448 --> 02:46:41,809
[SPEAKER_16]: Mustone.

2093
02:46:42,409 --> 02:46:46,571
[SPEAKER_18]: I just want to suggest that maybe we could even think about budgeting buying the supplies.

2094
02:46:46,631 --> 02:46:48,932
[SPEAKER_18]: So a friend of mine works in Portsmouth, New Hampshire,

2095
02:46:49,680 --> 02:46:52,262
[SPEAKER_18]: the school department buys the supply.

2096
02:46:52,342 --> 02:46:54,144
[SPEAKER_18]: She did look it up while she was over at my house.

2097
02:46:54,224 --> 02:46:55,204
[SPEAKER_18]: It's 40,000.

2098
02:46:55,365 --> 02:46:57,106
[SPEAKER_18]: They have a much smaller school system.

2099
02:46:57,846 --> 02:47:03,591
[SPEAKER_18]: But if we were to average $50 a student, it'd be $200,000 more or less.

2100
02:47:04,612 --> 02:47:12,738
[SPEAKER_18]: So, I mean, that is another goal that we could have because it is, I mean, I spent over $200 for the kids going to Staples.

2101
02:47:14,079 --> 02:47:18,743
[SPEAKER_18]: So, I mean, if we want to go beyond just trying to get a break on it,

2102
02:47:19,123 --> 02:47:20,844
[SPEAKER_18]: Why don't we put it into our school budget?

2103
02:47:20,864 --> 02:47:23,505
[SPEAKER_05]: It takes away from somewhere else, though.

2104
02:47:23,525 --> 02:47:23,846
[SPEAKER_18]: I know.

2105
02:47:23,866 --> 02:47:24,486
[SPEAKER_18]: Potentially.

2106
02:47:24,546 --> 02:47:25,126
[SPEAKER_18]: Somewhere else.

2107
02:47:26,687 --> 02:47:26,827
[SPEAKER_16]: Ms.

2108
02:47:26,847 --> 02:47:27,387
[SPEAKER_16]: Vander Kloot?

2109
02:47:33,971 --> 02:47:45,437
[SPEAKER_19]: I wanted to know whether we've replaced the teacher at the vocational school, the marketing teacher, whether we found someone to, I believe, that position retired or left for another?

2110
02:47:50,166 --> 02:47:56,049
[SPEAKER_08]: They are able to run the program with the single remaining based on the enrollment with that program.

2111
02:47:56,529 --> 02:47:58,771
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, so one teacher did leave though, right?

2112
02:47:58,791 --> 02:47:59,211
[SPEAKER_19]: Correct.

2113
02:48:00,251 --> 02:48:01,252
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, thanks.

2114
02:48:03,853 --> 02:48:04,533
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Ojiro.

2115
02:48:05,734 --> 02:48:13,898
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it might be an interesting project for our web coding to put together like a little web store to avoid the problem where we have an overfill issue.

2116
02:48:14,598 --> 02:48:21,143
[SPEAKER_03]: So parents could order what they need online, and then we could just ensure that they have a pickup spot location.

2117
02:48:22,004 --> 02:48:31,391
[SPEAKER_03]: So like, you know, Bobby's mom bought these supplies online, we'll have a little label printed out, Bobby's mom gets her supplies right at school.

2118
02:48:33,533 --> 02:48:33,733
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks.

2119
02:48:35,535 --> 02:48:35,815
[SPEAKER_16]: Ms.

2120
02:48:35,935 --> 02:48:36,215
[SPEAKER_16]: Kratz.

2121
02:48:36,755 --> 02:48:42,060
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes, I wanted to just bring up something that I found out from a parent in,

2122
02:48:43,198 --> 02:48:56,281
[SPEAKER_26]: I knew we were struggling to get an HVAC teacher and I got the most recent update I got is that unfortunately they haven't received any applicants.

2123
02:48:56,701 --> 02:49:01,622
[SPEAKER_26]: So they do not have an HVAC teacher right now at the vocational school.

2124
02:49:02,343 --> 02:49:12,545
[SPEAKER_26]: And a letter was sent home to all of the students that were enrolled in HVAC asking them to choose a different shop.

2125
02:49:13,230 --> 02:49:42,206
[SPEAKER_26]: program and you know I was I was you know I was kind of upset but I mean I guess the industry right now is I guess struggling with you know I heard back from Chad with a bunch of different vocational schools that are experiencing similar problems right now you know if the senior you know wants to pursue a co-op they can work with the co-op you know director

2126
02:49:42,682 --> 02:49:46,303
[SPEAKER_26]: to help find a job, because they'll still be able to go for the co-op opportunity.

2127
02:49:46,764 --> 02:49:55,227
[SPEAKER_26]: But anybody who wanted to choose HVAC, freshman, sophomore, junior, they're not going to have that choice this year.

2128
02:49:55,647 --> 02:50:11,633
[SPEAKER_26]: So I was concerned and thinking about, are we going to maybe be sending our kids off to Minuteman if those students really want to enroll in HVAC, because that might be what they want to pursue, which is what we kind of do

2129
02:50:12,166 --> 02:50:16,170
[SPEAKER_26]: for Essex Aggie or another program that we're not offering.

2130
02:50:16,210 --> 02:50:21,015
[SPEAKER_26]: So it's just something that we're going to have to start thinking about.

2131
02:50:21,035 --> 02:50:28,782
[SPEAKER_16]: We reached out to the unions as well to see if they could cultivate someone to become an instructor.

2132
02:50:29,543 --> 02:50:32,987
[SPEAKER_26]: And it's such a popular field and it's not going to go away.

2133
02:50:33,047 --> 02:50:36,050
[SPEAKER_26]: We need to have these young students learn and move on.

2134
02:50:37,338 --> 02:50:42,239
[SPEAKER_26]: But I know how hard, you know, it's still posted, the position is still posted.

2135
02:50:42,679 --> 02:50:45,760
[SPEAKER_20]: So I just wanted to, thank you, thank you Mayor.

2136
02:50:46,500 --> 02:50:51,021
[SPEAKER_20]: I just wanted to comment in terms of some of the vocational teachers.

2137
02:50:51,501 --> 02:51:02,203
[SPEAKER_20]: The challenge is that a lot of them are able to be compensated at a significantly higher rate in their actual field.

2138
02:51:02,603 --> 02:51:06,004
[SPEAKER_20]: So HVAC and with all the construction happening all over

2139
02:51:07,104 --> 02:51:17,192
[SPEAKER_20]: the casino, Boston, all over the state, there's so much construction happening that it's very difficult to either maintain or find.

2140
02:51:18,853 --> 02:51:30,222
[SPEAKER_20]: So I know Chad has been reposting and using all of his connections, and it has been a real challenge.

2141
02:51:30,843 --> 02:51:36,107
[SPEAKER_20]: So we are taking it very seriously, but it has been a challenge for us.

2142
02:51:38,172 --> 02:51:41,853
[SPEAKER_16]: I would imagine other districts are suffering the same.

2143
02:51:44,495 --> 02:51:45,135
[SPEAKER_16]: Are you all set, Ms.

2144
02:51:45,155 --> 02:51:45,795
[SPEAKER_16]: Krutz?

2145
02:51:46,235 --> 02:51:47,656
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Benedetto.

2146
02:51:48,176 --> 02:51:49,537
[SPEAKER_15]: So may I work?

2147
02:51:50,977 --> 02:51:51,537
[SPEAKER_15]: A few things.

2148
02:51:51,637 --> 02:51:57,380
[SPEAKER_15]: First of all, my husband's a union carpenter in Boston and has been for 38 years.

2149
02:51:57,820 --> 02:52:07,024
[SPEAKER_15]: And he said that throughout the community, they're struggling to bring in younger people into the trades and talented people.

2150
02:52:08,047 --> 02:52:13,929
[SPEAKER_15]: We really need to communicate to people in the community the value of these jobs.

2151
02:52:13,989 --> 02:52:16,869
[SPEAKER_15]: And these men and women make six figures.

2152
02:52:16,949 --> 02:52:22,091
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, they make a great living, and they provide well for their families.

2153
02:52:22,611 --> 02:52:28,673
[SPEAKER_15]: And Medford was built on the backs of hardworking people from the trades.

2154
02:52:28,973 --> 02:52:36,875
[SPEAKER_15]: We were shipbuilders in the beginning, and our commitment to our vocational school in the last few years has been exceptional.

2155
02:52:37,663 --> 02:53:04,725
[SPEAKER_15]: I would really hate to see programming close, so it's appeal to people in the community that might hear this, and maybe to our newspaper to get out the word that Method really wants to offer strong programming to our students, and we need people in the community to step up and help us in any way they can, even if it's, I don't know, if it's

2156
02:53:05,422 --> 02:53:13,605
[SPEAKER_15]: current companies or graduates that graduated from the HVAC program at vocational school coming back to teach students.

2157
02:53:13,965 --> 02:53:22,888
[SPEAKER_15]: And even if we have to offer some of those in the evening instead of the day, I mean, we might have to look outside the box to fill these needs.

2158
02:53:23,388 --> 02:53:28,450
[SPEAKER_15]: And I really don't want to start outsourcing back to Minuteman.

2159
02:53:28,650 --> 02:53:33,912
[SPEAKER_15]: We used to pay a million dollars a year in tuition to Minuteman, and then we were left with no money to invest

2160
02:53:34,598 --> 02:53:43,042
[SPEAKER_15]: of vocational programming, and we've come so far to offering great programming and great education to all of our students.

2161
02:53:44,063 --> 02:54:01,032
[SPEAKER_15]: So this, to me, is almost an emergency situation, and we have to work as a team, and I will contact some friends in the industry and see if they can help in any way, and I suggest that all of us do that, and anyone listening that could offer any help to please call us.

2162
02:54:02,338 --> 02:54:06,319
[SPEAKER_15]: This is a great way for a lot of students to move forward in their career.

2163
02:54:06,639 --> 02:54:15,402
[SPEAKER_15]: Children who, you know, college isn't the right choice for them or students that are gonna do both, trade in and college.

2164
02:54:15,662 --> 02:54:19,983
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, there are so many opportunities here and our community needs this.

2165
02:54:20,063 --> 02:54:22,104
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's just a dire emergency.

2166
02:54:22,384 --> 02:54:32,087
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd also like to know a little ahead of time when we're having these type of issues, maybe earlier in the summer, a quick email or an alert so that we can help

2167
02:54:32,719 --> 02:54:34,601
[SPEAKER_15]: in any way we can as committee members.

2168
02:54:35,642 --> 02:54:36,002
[SPEAKER_15]: That's it.

2169
02:54:36,102 --> 02:54:36,522
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

2170
02:54:37,383 --> 02:54:39,505
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Russo, did you wish to speak on this?

2171
02:54:39,545 --> 02:54:39,765
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

2172
02:54:39,865 --> 02:54:40,225
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2173
02:54:43,368 --> 02:54:43,949
[SPEAKER_16]: New business.

2174
02:54:44,589 --> 02:54:45,970
[SPEAKER_16]: We have several condolences.

2175
02:54:45,990 --> 02:54:51,615
[SPEAKER_16]: We have resolved that the Medford School Committee expresses sincere condolences to the family of Richard McGlynn.

2176
02:54:51,996 --> 02:54:58,381
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. McGlynn was the father of Special Education Secretary Susan Callahan and uncle of former Mayor Michael McGlynn.

2177
02:54:59,369 --> 02:55:04,576
[SPEAKER_16]: We had resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Claire Lynette Frida.

2178
02:55:05,096 --> 02:55:05,276
[SPEAKER_16]: Ms.

2179
02:55:05,317 --> 02:55:08,280
[SPEAKER_16]: Frida was the mother of Medford High School teacher, Lisa Dunphy.

2180
02:55:09,362 --> 02:55:15,149
[SPEAKER_16]: We had resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of John Bailey, Sr.

2181
02:55:15,309 --> 02:55:18,213
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Bailey was the founder of the North Medford Youth Hockey Program.

2182
02:55:18,782 --> 02:55:20,743
[SPEAKER_16]: which became Medford Recreational Hockey.

2183
02:55:21,224 --> 02:55:24,726
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Bailey was a senior custodian at Medford High School for many years.

2184
02:55:25,326 --> 02:55:29,990
[SPEAKER_16]: Actually, his grandson works for the city of Medford and is running our recreation program as well.

2185
02:55:31,130 --> 02:55:35,894
[SPEAKER_16]: Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of John Lynch, Sr.

2186
02:55:36,074 --> 02:55:40,076
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Lynch was the father of Andrew's middle school guidance counselor, Thomas Lynch.

2187
02:55:40,717 --> 02:55:43,659
[SPEAKER_16]: If we could all rise for a moment of silence on the passing of these residents.

2188
02:55:54,597 --> 02:56:04,920
[SPEAKER_16]: Also, if I could just make mention, this week we had a beautiful ceremony for two youngsters at the Andrews Middle School, Jacob Wright and Zach Bertucci.

2189
02:56:05,340 --> 02:56:06,821
[SPEAKER_16]: Am I pronouncing it correctly?

2190
02:56:07,561 --> 02:56:08,121
[SPEAKER_16]: Bertucci.

2191
02:56:09,101 --> 02:56:18,784
[SPEAKER_16]: They performed a heroic act at Hampton Beach this summer in late August, and they basically saved a woman's life there.

2192
02:56:19,630 --> 02:56:23,391
[SPEAKER_16]: So we had a wonderful presentation for these two young lads who were very humble.

2193
02:56:24,211 --> 02:56:25,651
[SPEAKER_16]: And they just did an amazing thing.

2194
02:56:25,691 --> 02:56:35,113
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think that they're just a very proud example of our students and how they stand tall and leadership skills that they are learning in the Medford school system.

2195
02:56:35,753 --> 02:56:41,514
[SPEAKER_16]: And it goes to the teachers, administrators, and their families as well that have really instilled such great ethic in them.

2196
02:56:41,554 --> 02:56:43,754
[SPEAKER_16]: So I just wanted everyone to be aware of that.

2197
02:56:43,814 --> 02:56:47,555
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's just a wonderful thing that these two young men did on August 20.

2198
02:56:48,235 --> 02:56:48,755
[SPEAKER_16]: So thank you.

2199
02:56:50,365 --> 02:56:53,655
[SPEAKER_16]: And with that being said, we are at the conclusion of our meeting.

2200
02:56:54,558 --> 02:56:55,561
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion to adjourn.
