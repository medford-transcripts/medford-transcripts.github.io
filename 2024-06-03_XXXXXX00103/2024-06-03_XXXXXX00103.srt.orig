00:00:42,242 --> 00:00:42,442

[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks so much for joining me today.

11
00:00:44,204 --> 00:00:47,966
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't mind just introducing yourself with your name, pronouns, and a bit about who you are.

12
00:00:49,147 --> 00:00:50,869
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Regina Parkinson.

[SPEAKER_01]: My pronouns are she, her, and I am the executive director of Arts Collaborative Medford.

14
00:00:56,613 --> 00:00:57,734
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for having me.

15
00:00:57,754 --> 00:00:58,714
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

16
00:00:58,775 --> 00:00:59,155
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

17
00:00:59,655 --> 00:01:08,522
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you could just answer the question that we ask everybody on the podcast, which is, what is your favorite place to eat in Medford and what do you like to eat there?

18
00:01:09,457 --> 00:01:10,520
[SPEAKER_01]: What a lovely question.

19
00:01:11,001 --> 00:01:17,198
[SPEAKER_01]: My favorite place currently is Deep Cuts and they have a Greek falafel wrap that I'm obsessed with.

20
00:01:18,067 --> 00:01:20,208
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, I went there recently for a drink.

21
00:01:20,268 --> 00:01:20,628
[SPEAKER_02]: It was great.

22
00:01:20,648 --> 00:01:23,129
[SPEAKER_02]: I hadn't been to the new space yet, but it was lovely.

23
00:01:23,169 --> 00:01:23,789
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm loving it.

24
00:01:24,009 --> 00:01:28,331
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's right up the street, and so it's just a really great place to grab a drink after work with friends.

25
00:01:28,411 --> 00:01:29,231
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been really nice.

26
00:01:29,491 --> 00:01:30,131
[SPEAKER_01]: They're so chill.

27
00:01:30,471 --> 00:01:31,552
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

28
00:01:31,712 --> 00:01:36,433
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so I'm hoping that we can talk a little bit about Arts Collaborative Medford.

29
00:01:36,473 --> 00:01:40,115
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we had Laurel Siegel on, what feels like forever ago.

30
00:01:40,175 --> 00:01:45,637
[SPEAKER_02]: But when she talked about the planning for this place, and it was very much still in, I think,

31
00:01:47,017 --> 00:01:49,759
[SPEAKER_02]: the hopes for Medford, but you've come a long way since then.

32
00:01:49,779 --> 00:01:52,421
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm wondering if you could tell us a little bit about what you're doing here.

33
00:01:52,702 --> 00:01:56,304
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, major shout out to Laurel for getting us here at all.

34
00:01:57,445 --> 00:02:03,230
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very exciting that we are in the actual living stage of this place where it's taken on a life of its own.

35
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:07,913
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were able to open our doors in January of this year.

36
00:02:08,353 --> 00:02:11,596
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're on month five of operating to some extent.

37
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:19,285
[SPEAKER_01]: And right now, our main focus are studio artists and getting some workshops up and running and having events in our main gallery space.

38
00:02:20,045 --> 00:02:20,205
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

39
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:24,908
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for people who don't know, you guys are on Mystic Ave, right?

40
00:02:24,928 --> 00:02:25,609
[SPEAKER_01]: 162 Mystic Ave.

41
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:27,010
[SPEAKER_01]: We face Mystic Ave.

42
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:29,171
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really fun little neighborhood.

43
00:02:29,331 --> 00:02:30,632
[SPEAKER_01]: It's changing very quickly.

44
00:02:30,732 --> 00:02:36,256
[SPEAKER_01]: So our neighbors are Atlas Liquors, and then we are also attached to the same building as Theory Wellness.

45
00:02:36,796 --> 00:02:36,936
Great.

46
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,123
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, so you said you're currently a space for artists and it sounds like there's a community component.

47
00:02:42,143 --> 00:02:53,370
[SPEAKER_02]: So definitely that's something that we like to kind of talk about on the podcast is how, you know, I think we're always interested in, um, you know, sort of making a more diverse, inclusive, um, community here.

48
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:59,574
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I wonder if you could share kind of what your hopes are in terms of an impact on the, on the city of Medford.

49
00:02:59,814 --> 00:03:00,355
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.

50
00:03:00,475 --> 00:03:07,039
[SPEAKER_01]: Our mission is to be welcoming and accessible, and we mean that in every word, every way of those words.

51
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,401
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're always open to expanding what we mean by that.

52
00:03:11,521 --> 00:03:23,324
[SPEAKER_01]: So most of the job that I've been doing and my board has been doing very graciously is talking to as many people as possible because I don't think you can build a community space without knowing who your community is.

53
00:03:23,684 --> 00:03:36,707
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's been absolutely lovely and wonderful to be having those conversations and figuring out sort of the needs that are answered to some degree or can be answered better and how this space is gonna be able to fill those needs.

54
00:03:37,802 --> 00:03:38,763
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, what have you been finding out?

55
00:03:39,524 --> 00:03:41,745
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, um, people love books.

56
00:03:41,905 --> 00:03:42,786
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one thing.

57
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:50,972
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, the library is new in our city and Sam Sednick over the library is doing such a wonderful job with their programming.

58
00:03:51,032 --> 00:03:57,597
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have had conversations just about their maker space and what they're able to host, what we're able to host.

59
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:04,809
[SPEAKER_01]: We're also finding a lot of demand for adult programming in the evenings and on weekends, things that people can come and do.

60
00:04:04,849 --> 00:04:08,314
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a really big need to learn, and that's really awesome.

61
00:04:09,075 --> 00:04:11,178
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be trying to kick off some kids programming.

62
00:04:11,198 --> 00:04:12,660
[SPEAKER_01]: There's always a need for that.

63
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:15,004
[SPEAKER_01]: I see birthday parties in our future.

64
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:20,380
[SPEAKER_01]: Interactive things, I also have a desire to get more musicians in here.

65
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:24,522
[SPEAKER_01]: We happen to have a space that is really welcoming to sound.

66
00:04:25,142 --> 00:04:36,026
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's not just the visual arts, which I think I'm trained in, and we can get into that, but it's also, it's every medium under that larger umbrella of what arts and community can be.

67
00:04:36,486 --> 00:04:41,488
[SPEAKER_01]: So music, literature, and all the visual kind of components.

68
00:04:41,923 --> 00:04:44,325
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you kind of just like it was a good lead in there.

69
00:04:44,365 --> 00:04:46,226
[SPEAKER_02]: But can you tell us a little bit how you got into this?

70
00:04:46,646 --> 00:04:48,567
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I would love to.

71
00:04:48,587 --> 00:04:52,770
[SPEAKER_01]: I first moved to Medford directly out of college, which was UMass Amherst.

72
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:57,072
[SPEAKER_01]: And I moved into my brother's apartment on Princeton Street in Medford.

73
00:04:57,813 --> 00:05:02,155
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had a degree in art history and was like, I'm going to use this.

74
00:05:03,116 --> 00:05:09,860
[SPEAKER_01]: And worked at Diesel Cafe, shout out Diesel Cafe, and started curating on the walls of the cafe pretty quickly.

75
00:05:10,909 --> 00:05:13,191
[SPEAKER_01]: and figuring out that I could help local artists.

76
00:05:13,471 --> 00:05:15,852
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's just been my through line ever since.

77
00:05:16,453 --> 00:05:19,034
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going on like 14 years now of that.

78
00:05:20,315 --> 00:05:23,357
[SPEAKER_01]: I continue to do that in different varying capacities.

79
00:05:24,178 --> 00:05:27,820
[SPEAKER_01]: I did leave Boston for a little while to like spread wings.

80
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,943
[SPEAKER_01]: And that led me to some really great opportunities, one of which was living in New Orleans for a few years.

81
00:05:33,701 --> 00:05:40,283
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's a really rich cultural environment that if anyone has a chance to get into, I recommend.

82
00:05:40,784 --> 00:05:43,865
[SPEAKER_01]: And being there really made me feel like this was my home.

83
00:05:44,505 --> 00:05:48,946
[SPEAKER_01]: So I came back and I got a master's degree in nonprofit leadership.

84
00:05:49,407 --> 00:05:58,170
[SPEAKER_01]: And I worked at the South Boston-based nonprofit Artists for Humanity for about three years in a capacity of exhibitions and art sales.

85
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:09,513
[SPEAKER_01]: and then I came over here when this opportunity arose and it felt like it was perfectly poised both for Arts Collaborative Medford and for me to take on this next kind of journey of the Medford art scene together.

86
00:06:10,413 --> 00:06:10,613
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.

87
00:06:10,973 --> 00:06:14,094
[SPEAKER_02]: I also went to college in the Pioneer Valley, so yeah, familiar place.

88
00:06:14,654 --> 00:06:15,514
[SPEAKER_02]: It's wonderful.

89
00:06:15,554 --> 00:06:16,315
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, great.

90
00:06:16,395 --> 00:06:23,377
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, I guess I'm wondering like how, you know, like it's really nice to hear about kind of what you're bringing here.

91
00:06:23,397 --> 00:06:24,577
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's any kind of like

92
00:06:25,417 --> 00:06:43,453
[SPEAKER_02]: mark that you want to kind of put on this or how you're how you're bringing all that experience and knowledge to arts collaborative medford yeah i because of

93
00:06:44,557 --> 00:06:48,383
[SPEAKER_01]: what I've done in the past and I can talk a little bit about an example.

94
00:06:48,764 --> 00:06:54,974
[SPEAKER_01]: I just really value putting the artist first and I have a very much

95
00:06:56,632 --> 00:06:59,295
[SPEAKER_01]: style of listening and that before leading.

96
00:06:59,935 --> 00:07:02,578
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's what I'm going to continue to do here.

97
00:07:02,678 --> 00:07:16,771
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was in New Orleans with a good friend of mine, we started an arts fair that was a reaction to what we saw happening in New Orleans and in the larger global art scene, which is it's big blue ticket items.

98
00:07:16,871 --> 00:07:19,954
[SPEAKER_01]: It's people that aren't original to New Orleans coming in and

99
00:07:21,787 --> 00:07:29,257
[SPEAKER_01]: nothing's affordable, nothing's accessible for artists who are actually trying to make a living, and so we created a fair where we paid our artists to come into the fair.

100
00:07:29,397 --> 00:07:30,218
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone got paid.

101
00:07:30,819 --> 00:07:36,046
[SPEAKER_01]: For some people in there, it was their first time making money off their art, and it was really just about

102
00:07:37,494 --> 00:07:40,735
[SPEAKER_01]: empowering and lifting those artists up specifically.

103
00:07:40,755 --> 00:07:43,696
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just, I'm all about locality.

104
00:07:44,296 --> 00:07:49,598
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that it starts at home and you lift up the people at home and then you see what happens from there.

105
00:07:49,658 --> 00:07:53,259
[SPEAKER_01]: And you do that with network and connection and listening and empathy.

106
00:07:54,656 --> 00:07:59,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, that sounds like a real crossover between art and non-profit leadership, like you're saying.

107
00:07:59,977 --> 00:08:01,318
[SPEAKER_02]: I really appreciate that perspective.

108
00:08:01,698 --> 00:08:06,679
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and can you tell us how artists that have their studios here, how does that work?

109
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:07,959
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you getting them?

110
00:08:08,019 --> 00:08:09,019
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that like for them?

111
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:21,482
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'll give a shout out to Susan Altman, who is our current board president and did a lot of the legwork before I even arrived in this role to find amazing artists to kind of kick off what I call our first cohort of artists.

112
00:08:21,922 --> 00:08:23,423
[SPEAKER_01]: So we currently have eight artists.

113
00:08:24,763 --> 00:08:29,448
[SPEAKER_01]: in Medford, from Medford, have been in Medford before, or very close by.

114
00:08:29,528 --> 00:08:31,270
[SPEAKER_01]: So everyone is a local artist.

115
00:08:32,353 --> 00:08:39,018
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are all different mediums and all different levels of how they go about their work, but they're very active.

116
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:44,442
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have a pretty active cohort of artists right now that will continue to expand and grow.

117
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:51,947
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's kind of yet to be seen exactly what happens, but that's the exciting part because we get to decide, they get to decide, all of us together.

118
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:56,530
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's been really fun getting to know them and starting some programming with them.

119
00:08:57,675 --> 00:09:00,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and you mentioned like relationships with the library.

120
00:09:00,397 --> 00:09:04,239
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any other kind of like stakeholders in Medford that have been like helpful in supporting your work?

121
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:06,000
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, absolutely.

122
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:12,524
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say Tufts University right off the bat, Rocco DiRico over there and working with the School of Museum of Fine Arts.

123
00:09:12,764 --> 00:09:24,631
[SPEAKER_01]: So next Friday, the 24th, we will have the School of Museum of Fine Arts Graphic Novel Club here with nine original graphic novels.

124
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:33,012
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're so excited to start building partnerships like that with the school, so that those artists know that this place is accessible to them.

125
00:09:33,912 --> 00:09:38,633
[SPEAKER_01]: We also, I've talked to Event Them, which is another great event spot in Medford.

126
00:09:38,713 --> 00:09:42,594
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to V. Theory Wellness has been wonderful.

127
00:09:42,714 --> 00:09:46,835
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we're really here because they wanted us to be, and that feels really special.

128
00:09:46,915 --> 00:09:48,576
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're getting to know the community too.

129
00:09:49,016 --> 00:09:53,297
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of people involved in town that are making this possible.

130
00:09:54,649 --> 00:09:59,673
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if somebody is listening to the podcast and they're like, I want to check that space out, what do you recommend to them?

131
00:10:00,894 --> 00:10:06,699
[SPEAKER_01]: We are open for public viewing hours Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday from 12 p.m.

132
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:07,580
[SPEAKER_01]: to 5 p.m.

133
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,242
[SPEAKER_01]: I also recommend keeping an eye on our website.

134
00:10:10,763 --> 00:10:15,545
[SPEAKER_01]: and our social media platforms because we have events that happen outside of those hours.

135
00:10:15,685 --> 00:10:20,908
[SPEAKER_01]: Those things can be workshops, they can be public events that are free, and we love for people to come in and drop by.

136
00:10:21,448 --> 00:10:30,672
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, anytime I'm here, the doors are open, so you can always shoot an email through that website form and just let me know you want to pop in, give us a call and I won't bite.

137
00:10:30,692 --> 00:10:31,313
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.

138
00:10:31,353 --> 00:10:31,513
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

139
00:10:31,553 --> 00:10:31,813
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

140
00:10:31,893 --> 00:10:35,275
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, we can put some of those, some of that information in our show notes for people.

141
00:10:35,815 --> 00:10:38,096
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, is there anything else that you want to make sure that we know about?

142
00:10:39,535 --> 00:10:44,360
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that if you're listening to this and this is really exciting for you, I would love to talk to you.

143
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,964
[SPEAKER_01]: We're still growing and we're at a capacity where we're taking in as much input as we can.

144
00:10:49,084 --> 00:10:57,993
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to attend a workshop and there's something you want to see on our calendar, if you have a skill that you want to share and you want to teach people how to grow a garden in their backyard.

145
00:10:58,543 --> 00:11:01,986
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are a musician and you want to play here, I could go on and on.

146
00:11:02,086 --> 00:11:04,828
[SPEAKER_01]: But if this is resonating with you, definitely reach out.

147
00:11:05,669 --> 00:11:11,194
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to make sure that this place is of the community and for the community and by the community.

148
00:11:11,234 --> 00:11:13,195
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're doing all we can to make that possible.

149
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:14,817
[SPEAKER_01]: And you are definitely a huge part of that.

150
00:11:15,778 --> 00:11:20,722
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm wondering if there's any other kind of special opportunities for for Medford or local artists.

151
00:11:21,554 --> 00:11:26,198
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I actually am really excited about one that we're going to be announcing pretty soon.

152
00:11:26,298 --> 00:11:27,219
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been working on it.

153
00:11:27,299 --> 00:11:34,204
[SPEAKER_01]: It's possible you've heard about it, but there is a woman named Louise Muster-Choate who was involved in this project since 2017.

154
00:11:34,645 --> 00:11:38,007
[SPEAKER_01]: She passed away in 2020, but this wouldn't be here without her.

155
00:11:38,067 --> 00:11:44,833
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've built a scholarship in her name under the premise that we're going to give that money to artists to be in our space for free.

156
00:11:45,368 --> 00:11:53,214
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the next couple weeks, we'll be launching the application for that and I'm hoping to fill one to two spots with emerging local artists who are in need of

157
00:11:53,704 --> 00:11:55,625
[SPEAKER_01]: a space and wouldn't be able to afford it on their own.

158
00:11:55,645 --> 00:12:00,168
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'll be in here totally subsidized off of her name, which is a really, really nice way to honor her.

159
00:12:00,508 --> 00:12:02,009
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds like a nice tribute.

160
00:12:02,329 --> 00:12:06,011
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm also wondering about other ways for the community to contribute to a place like this.

161
00:12:06,051 --> 00:12:07,292
[SPEAKER_02]: So do you take donations?

162
00:12:07,332 --> 00:12:08,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you do fundraising?

163
00:12:08,972 --> 00:12:10,713
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, yes, we do all of that.

164
00:12:11,354 --> 00:12:15,176
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are in a place to give, we are so grateful for your support.

165
00:12:15,616 --> 00:12:19,101
[SPEAKER_01]: please reach out and we would love to find a way to cultivate that with you.

166
00:12:19,601 --> 00:12:27,171
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are someone that has lots of art supplies in your basement and in your closet that you're not using, you can hand those over too.

167
00:12:27,211 --> 00:12:29,434
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another announcement I'll be making to open that up.

168
00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:39,248
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a local artist and you have small pieces you want to sell, I have these beautiful glass display cases that I fill with local works from Medford artists that are under $200.

169
00:12:39,749 --> 00:12:40,670
[SPEAKER_01]: Come bring that by.

170
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:44,894
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of ways for people to give, not just monetarily, but also their time.

171
00:12:45,254 --> 00:12:46,796
[SPEAKER_01]: And we would love to meet you and talk about it.

172
00:12:46,816 --> 00:12:47,677
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

173
00:12:47,977 --> 00:12:48,818
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you so much.
