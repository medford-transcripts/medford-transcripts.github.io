39
00:01:42,913 --> 00:01:43,734
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Superintendent.

40
00:01:45,874 --> 00:01:49,076
[SPEAKER_15]: What number are you for?

41
00:01:50,256 --> 00:01:53,598
[SPEAKER_18]: Madam Mayor, members of the committee, it's a distinct pleasure tonight

42
00:01:54,553 --> 00:02:07,106
[SPEAKER_18]: to welcome an individual who represents a fine institution in our community, who has made it possible for our schools to have this outstanding contribution by one of our teachers.

43
00:02:07,606 --> 00:02:15,454
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to turn it over to our assistant superintendent, Diane Caldwell, to explain it, make a presentation, and you have it in front of you.

44
00:02:17,616 --> 00:02:18,096
[SPEAKER_21]: Good evening.

45
00:02:20,025 --> 00:02:31,835
[SPEAKER_21]: So it is with great pleasure that I present to you this evening a book written by one of our very own, Michael Coates, a third grade teacher at the Brooks Elementary School.

46
00:02:31,995 --> 00:02:38,041
[SPEAKER_21]: The book is entitled, Our Medford, An Elementary Guide to the History of Medford.

47
00:02:39,121 --> 00:02:43,286
[SPEAKER_21]: This book represents a project that Mr. Coates has been working on for years.

48
00:02:43,386 --> 00:02:53,778
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, originally I thought it was just a few years, but his wife Maria, who is here with him this evening, told me that this has been a labor of love for him for many, many years.

49
00:02:57,222 --> 00:02:58,743
[SPEAKER_21]: He teaches

50
00:03:00,498 --> 00:03:08,081
[SPEAKER_21]: third grade at the Brooks Elementary School, and this is a book that has to do with social studies, which is part of our curriculum.

51
00:03:09,081 --> 00:03:17,305
[SPEAKER_21]: As Mr. Coates states in his report, he didn't want our local history to be underappreciated and or ignored.

52
00:03:18,185 --> 00:03:26,214
[SPEAKER_21]: Medford's history is important, should be taught and celebrated, and local history is part of our learning standards.

53
00:03:27,034 --> 00:03:33,421
[SPEAKER_21]: He researched his facts with the Medford Historical Society to ensure his book for accuracy.

54
00:03:34,442 --> 00:03:43,065
[SPEAKER_21]: And in April of this year, Mr. Coates contacted Century Bank to ask if they would consider helping with the cost of printing this book.

55
00:03:43,645 --> 00:03:56,409
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, interestingly enough, when I was speaking to Michael about this, he said that Mr. Sloan just picked up the phone and got right on and said, of course, we will do this for the Medford students, and he will help with the printing costs.

56
00:03:56,969 --> 00:04:03,351
[SPEAKER_21]: So this year, we are piloting the book at the Brooks Elementary School, and next year, hopefully,

57
00:04:03,951 --> 00:04:12,157
[SPEAKER_21]: if you endorse this for us, all of our third grade teachers will get to read this book with the help of Mr. Sloan who will print it for us.

58
00:04:13,037 --> 00:04:18,941
[SPEAKER_21]: Attached you will find a report from Michael with a timeline and information about Century Bank.

59
00:04:19,822 --> 00:04:31,530
[SPEAKER_21]: I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr. Coates for his perseverance in this project and to also thank Mr. Barry Sloan for his continued dedication to Medford Public Schools.

60
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:36,071
[SPEAKER_21]: With Mr. Coates this evening is his wife, Maria.

61
00:04:36,091 --> 00:04:47,553
[SPEAKER_21]: His brother, Tom, and his sister-in-law, Christina.

62
00:04:51,914 --> 00:04:58,496
[SPEAKER_21]: Allison Andrews, who is from the Medford Historical Society, who was very instrumental in helping Michael with this project.

63
00:04:58,536 --> 00:04:59,636
[SPEAKER_21]: Michael, would you please come up?

64
00:05:06,735 --> 00:05:08,436
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. Sloan, I'd like to have you come up as well.

65
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:13,858
[SPEAKER_21]: So once again, a labor of love from Michael.

66
00:05:13,898 --> 00:05:15,218
[SPEAKER_21]: We have an author among us.

67
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:19,240
[SPEAKER_21]: As you can tell by your books, he's autographed them.

68
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:24,562
[SPEAKER_21]: We're very, very happy that Michael has seen this dream of his come to fruition.

69
00:05:24,982 --> 00:05:27,123
[SPEAKER_21]: And our children will benefit from this.

70
00:05:27,863 --> 00:05:30,344
[SPEAKER_21]: At this time, I'd like to present something to Mr. Sloan.

71
00:05:30,884 --> 00:05:32,325
[SPEAKER_21]: Michael, you may help me with this, please.

72
00:05:34,926 --> 00:05:35,106
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

73
00:05:36,427 --> 00:05:37,488
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's move a little closer here.

74
00:05:37,548 --> 00:05:42,991
[SPEAKER_21]: So, this is a certificate of appreciation from the Medford Public Schools.

75
00:05:43,451 --> 00:05:49,695
[SPEAKER_21]: We are proud to recognize Barry Sloan for dedication and commitment to the students of Medford Public Schools.

76
00:05:50,416 --> 00:06:03,904
[SPEAKER_21]: Signed by our Mayor, Stephanie Muccini-Burke, Aaron DiBenedetto, Vice Chairperson, Robert Skerry, Junior Secretary, Ann Marie Cuno, Roy E. Belson, Superintendent of Schools, Kathleen Kreatz,

77
00:06:04,972 --> 00:06:08,093
[SPEAKER_21]: Mia Quinn Mastone, and Paulette Van der Kloot.

78
00:06:20,076 --> 00:06:21,557
[SPEAKER_21]: We'd be happy to take any questions.

79
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:33,168
[SPEAKER_19]: So first, Mr. Coates, I heard that this was in the wind when I went to a historical meeting and society meeting, and I cannot believe how great the finished product looks.

80
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:38,392
[SPEAKER_19]: Years ago when I first started on the school committee, there was another book

81
00:06:39,195 --> 00:06:40,156
[SPEAKER_19]: and it was very weak.

82
00:06:40,896 --> 00:06:53,303
[SPEAKER_19]: And this is so wonderful, and the fact that you've included students in the, also highlighting some of the students, how proud they must be to be authors as well.

83
00:06:53,423 --> 00:07:04,889
[SPEAKER_19]: So thank you for all of your dedication, for bringing Medford history to light, and for including our students so that they can look back and think about the time that they've been in a published author.

84
00:07:05,329 --> 00:07:07,370
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Sloan, thank you for your generosity.

85
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:13,271
[SPEAKER_19]: We really appreciate your support of everything you do in Medford, and this is just a terrific testament to that.

86
00:07:13,451 --> 00:07:14,652
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you so much for being here.

87
00:07:14,852 --> 00:07:16,732
[SPEAKER_17]: May I say a word?

88
00:07:16,772 --> 00:07:18,033
[SPEAKER_17]: Would it be alright?

89
00:07:18,913 --> 00:07:27,135
[SPEAKER_17]: Madam Chair, Madam Mayor, Mr. Superintendent, on behalf of my father, Marshall, who, as the mayor knows, just celebrated his 90th birthday,

90
00:07:27,995 --> 00:07:31,976
[SPEAKER_17]: and left a little early today from the office, but with apologies.

91
00:07:33,237 --> 00:07:40,239
[SPEAKER_17]: But who also just finished his own book, his own autobiography, so we know how much of a project such a thing can be to do it well.

92
00:07:40,299 --> 00:07:45,221
[SPEAKER_17]: But Medford is our home, and Century Bank is thrilled to be here.

93
00:07:45,801 --> 00:07:47,102
[SPEAKER_17]: It has treated us so well.

94
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:54,324
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll do anything we can at any time to help the educational system of the city of Medford.

95
00:07:54,404 --> 00:07:56,285
[SPEAKER_17]: My sister and I are committed to that.

96
00:07:56,742 --> 00:08:01,370
[SPEAKER_17]: So I will continue to just pick up the phone and take those calls and be happy to help.

97
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:03,193
[SPEAKER_17]: So please let us know when we can.

98
00:08:03,753 --> 00:08:05,076
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you very much for this opportunity.

99
00:08:13,022 --> 00:08:17,844
[SPEAKER_06]: As my colleague has said, first of all, to Mr. Sloan and his family, always being there for us.

100
00:08:19,184 --> 00:08:24,486
[SPEAKER_06]: We are immensely grateful to you, your family, and for everything that you've done.

101
00:08:24,606 --> 00:08:32,589
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we know that you do it, not only because you do it financially to help us, but we really, truly believe that you do it with your heart.

102
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:40,552
[SPEAKER_06]: And we know that that is very, that's more sometimes, even though we love the money, we know that it does come from the heart.

103
00:08:42,325 --> 00:08:46,226
[SPEAKER_06]: And to Michael, thank you, because I know this came from your heart.

104
00:08:46,286 --> 00:08:56,490
[SPEAKER_06]: And it really is a testament to you, to your family, to the support you have, but to give back to the city, and to our schools, and to the kids, and our teachers.

105
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:57,070
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's great.

106
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,611
[SPEAKER_06]: I am curious in knowing, though, Catherine Coates.

107
00:09:00,571 --> 00:09:01,192
[SPEAKER_06]: Related to you?

108
00:09:01,652 --> 00:09:02,892
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that's my sister.

109
00:09:03,192 --> 00:09:03,452
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, OK.

110
00:09:03,472 --> 00:09:04,273
[SPEAKER_06]: It's your sister.

111
00:09:04,533 --> 00:09:05,713
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, because I saw her in the book.

112
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:06,934
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was curious in knowing.

113
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:10,552
[SPEAKER_02]: She was the runner-up for Miss Medford.

114
00:09:10,952 --> 00:09:12,413
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

115
00:09:12,473 --> 00:09:12,713
[SPEAKER_02]: In 1976.

116
00:09:12,773 --> 00:09:13,053
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

117
00:09:13,234 --> 00:09:14,935
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

118
00:09:15,235 --> 00:09:16,136
[SPEAKER_06]: See, I was reading it.

119
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:16,536
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

120
00:09:16,576 --> 00:09:17,697
[SPEAKER_02]: She couldn't be here tonight.

121
00:09:17,737 --> 00:09:19,538
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that was good.

122
00:09:19,579 --> 00:09:20,039
[SPEAKER_06]: That was good.

123
00:09:20,079 --> 00:09:20,980
[SPEAKER_06]: But no, it's great.

124
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:23,041
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's just such a vibrant book.

125
00:09:23,081 --> 00:09:27,685
[SPEAKER_06]: And it really calls you to open up the pages and read on.

126
00:09:27,745 --> 00:09:28,686
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you for this.

127
00:09:28,886 --> 00:09:30,627
[SPEAKER_06]: This is just a great, great thing.

128
00:09:30,687 --> 00:09:31,027
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

129
00:09:31,328 --> 00:09:33,549
[SPEAKER_21]: There's a picture of Michael's son also in the book.

130
00:09:33,589 --> 00:09:35,511
[SPEAKER_21]: Michael and Maria's son, as you open the book.

131
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:39,472
[SPEAKER_18]: Madam Mayor, no one gets away without a picture, so we've got to get everybody in here.

132
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:40,893
[SPEAKER_20]: Ms.

133
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:41,173
[SPEAKER_20]: Crutt.

134
00:09:41,493 --> 00:09:42,174
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

135
00:09:42,454 --> 00:09:43,814
[SPEAKER_20]: I wanted to say congratulations.

136
00:09:44,835 --> 00:09:46,276
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's just, it's amazing.

137
00:09:46,376 --> 00:09:50,899
[SPEAKER_20]: And I know you waited a long time to finally, you know, publish and your dream come true.

138
00:09:50,979 --> 00:09:52,159
[SPEAKER_20]: And thank you, Mr. Sloan.

139
00:09:52,199 --> 00:09:58,243
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'm really excited to read this and I'm really happy for the Brooks School that they're going to pilot the book.

140
00:09:58,723 --> 00:09:59,364
[SPEAKER_20]: So exciting.

141
00:10:00,204 --> 00:10:01,004
[SPEAKER_20]: Congratulations.

142
00:10:01,185 --> 00:10:01,485
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

143
00:10:03,113 --> 00:10:05,754
[SPEAKER_15]: And Mr. Coates, thank you so much for this labor of love.

144
00:10:05,794 --> 00:10:08,874
[SPEAKER_15]: We really appreciate it, and I know the students will, especially tomorrow.

145
00:10:08,914 --> 00:10:16,696
[SPEAKER_15]: I have a first grade class coming to visit, so I will definitely pull it out and share with them from the, I think it's from the Roberts School, actually, coming in tomorrow.

146
00:10:17,577 --> 00:10:20,777
[SPEAKER_15]: And thank you so much, Mr. Sloan, for your commitment to this community.

147
00:10:20,817 --> 00:10:22,938
[SPEAKER_15]: We really appreciate it, and for all your help as well.

148
00:10:23,318 --> 00:10:24,238
[SPEAKER_15]: So thank you so much.

149
00:10:24,298 --> 00:10:26,019
[SPEAKER_15]: I know the superintendent wants a picture.

150
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:27,859
[SPEAKER_15]: We need a picture.

151
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:30,100
[SPEAKER_18]: You have to memorialize it for the next edition.

152
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,503
[SPEAKER_02]: I also want to, if I could, recognize Allison Andrews.

153
00:10:36,023 --> 00:10:41,248
[SPEAKER_02]: And Allison Andrews is with the Historical Society, and she was a big help through the project.

154
00:10:41,928 --> 00:10:44,351
[SPEAKER_02]: And she made sure all the facts were correct.

155
00:10:45,131 --> 00:10:45,732
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Ms.

156
00:10:45,772 --> 00:10:46,092
[SPEAKER_15]: Andrews.

157
00:10:46,292 --> 00:10:46,693
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

158
00:10:50,336 --> 00:10:55,140
[SPEAKER_15]: Before we all leave, there's a motion on the floor to accept the gift by Mr. Skerry, seconded by Ms.

159
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:55,820
[SPEAKER_15]: Van der Kloot.

160
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,381
[SPEAKER_15]: Roll call.

161
00:10:58,102 --> 00:10:58,463
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Young.

162
00:10:58,483 --> 00:10:58,643
Yes.

00:10:59,772 --> 00:11:00,352
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

00:11:37,407 --> 00:11:37,468
you

166
00:12:43,588 --> 00:12:44,530
Oh, sorry.

167
00:13:16,345 --> 00:13:17,187
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit.

168
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:46,500
[SPEAKER_14]: Excuse me?

169
00:13:46,821 --> 00:14:13,340
[SPEAKER_06]: Historical Society, the book is available to be purchased through the Historical Society for $20, and all proceeds go back to the Historical Society, I believe.

170
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:14,525
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what Michael just said.

171
00:14:14,946 --> 00:14:18,207
[SPEAKER_06]: So anyone who is interested to purchase.

172
00:14:18,267 --> 00:14:19,368
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Coates, quick question.

173
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:22,129
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there a PDF of the book available online or no?

174
00:14:23,569 --> 00:14:24,650
[SPEAKER_15]: It will be online as well.

175
00:14:25,991 --> 00:14:26,251
[SPEAKER_15]: Great.

176
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:27,171
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much.

177
00:14:29,472 --> 00:14:33,014
[SPEAKER_15]: While we're under suspension, report on National Scholastic Medal winner.

178
00:14:33,034 --> 00:14:35,195
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Superintendent.

179
00:14:35,495 --> 00:14:42,338
[SPEAKER_18]: Madam Mayor, we're going to call upon our Director of Humanities to make a presentation to the National Scholastic Medal winner.

180
00:14:42,991 --> 00:14:46,454
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll call on Dr. Chiesa to come up here and make that presentation.

181
00:14:47,174 --> 00:14:49,096
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'll do it from down there.

182
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:51,798
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you like to come up here and do it?

183
00:14:52,719 --> 00:14:53,459
[SPEAKER_01]: Whichever you prefer, sure.

184
00:14:53,499 --> 00:14:53,719
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

185
00:14:53,739 --> 00:15:08,651
[SPEAKER_15]: Hello, Dr. Chiesa.

186
00:15:09,231 --> 00:15:09,572
[SPEAKER_15]: How are you?

187
00:15:09,592 --> 00:15:09,952
[SPEAKER_15]: Good, thanks.

188
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:10,392
[SPEAKER_15]: How are you?

189
00:15:10,412 --> 00:15:10,933
[SPEAKER_15]: Good, thank you.

190
00:15:12,347 --> 00:15:12,847
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening.

191
00:15:13,347 --> 00:15:24,573
[SPEAKER_01]: The English Language Arts Department is thrilled to announce that Hannah Rogers, a freshman at Medford High School, has received a national silver medal for her work in the Scholastic Writing Awards.

192
00:15:25,513 --> 00:15:29,395
[SPEAKER_01]: Hannah is a freshman at Medford High, and her piece was entitled James.

193
00:15:29,915 --> 00:15:36,598
[SPEAKER_01]: You may recall when we honored the Boston Globe Scholastic Writing Awards that Hannah was a Gold Key recipient.

194
00:15:37,038 --> 00:15:40,260
[SPEAKER_01]: Her work moved on to the national level, and she received a silver medal.

195
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:47,306
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the first time a Medford student has ever placed in the national part of the competition.

196
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:48,667
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are thrilled.

197
00:15:48,987 --> 00:15:49,187
[SPEAKER_01]: Ms.

198
00:15:49,267 --> 00:15:50,248
[SPEAKER_01]: Lu is here tonight.

199
00:15:50,308 --> 00:15:51,069
[SPEAKER_01]: She is her teacher.

200
00:15:51,089 --> 00:15:51,990
[SPEAKER_01]: And we want to thank Ms.

201
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:54,832
[SPEAKER_01]: Lu for the time she has put in with Hannah.

202
00:15:54,932 --> 00:15:58,876
[SPEAKER_01]: And we really want to congratulate and honor Hannah tonight, because we're thrilled.

203
00:15:59,136 --> 00:16:01,178
[SPEAKER_01]: So please join me in congratulating her.

204
00:16:19,608 --> 00:16:20,669
[SPEAKER_15]: Congratulations, Hannah.

205
00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:28,717
[SPEAKER_15]: The Medford Public Schools is proud to recognize Hannah Rogers National Silver Medal Scholastic Writing Award for myself and the school committee members.

206
00:16:28,777 --> 00:16:29,598
[SPEAKER_15]: Congratulations.

207
00:16:45,058 --> 00:16:50,702
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, every year we get a group of freshmen, and you look and you say, wow, what potential.

208
00:16:51,423 --> 00:16:53,084
[SPEAKER_00]: And with Hannah, she walked right in.

209
00:16:53,104 --> 00:16:59,709
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of the first things I said to her parents on parent night is, she's got it all, and she's going to go far.

210
00:17:00,069 --> 00:17:02,371
[SPEAKER_00]: And she surpassed anything I could have thought.

211
00:17:02,872 --> 00:17:04,353
[SPEAKER_00]: Her piece was all her own.

212
00:17:05,594 --> 00:17:06,494
[SPEAKER_00]: It's her tone.

213
00:17:06,554 --> 00:17:08,216
[SPEAKER_00]: She's got an established writing style.

214
00:17:08,776 --> 00:17:13,940
[SPEAKER_00]: And all I can say is, and I'm going to share the piece, so I'll have it on the Medford School page.

215
00:17:14,877 --> 00:17:18,301
[SPEAKER_00]: for you all to look at, but Hannah is exceptional.

216
00:17:38,947 --> 00:17:48,155
[SPEAKER_19]: I just wanna mention not only congratulations to this fine young lady on her achievement, but also as Ms.

217
00:17:48,215 --> 00:17:55,121
[SPEAKER_19]: Liu slinks away, she was the, last week was the National Honor Society, and Ms.

218
00:17:55,181 --> 00:17:57,082
[SPEAKER_19]: Liu is the advisor for that club.

219
00:17:57,162 --> 00:18:06,070
[SPEAKER_19]: She did such a lovely job, though she never wants to take any credit, so I'm outing her and saying thank you very much, Mrs. Liu, for your work with our students.

220
00:18:17,773 --> 00:18:18,513
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Benedetto?

221
00:18:19,053 --> 00:18:20,294
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I was just going to ask Ms.

222
00:18:20,354 --> 00:18:24,915
[SPEAKER_13]: Lewis if she could email us a copy of Hannah's writing.

223
00:18:27,316 --> 00:18:28,056
[SPEAKER_13]: That would be great.

224
00:18:28,557 --> 00:18:29,577
[SPEAKER_13]: That would be terrific.

225
00:18:29,657 --> 00:18:30,557
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you so much.

226
00:18:30,617 --> 00:18:32,698
[SPEAKER_13]: And congratulations to Hannah.

227
00:18:32,738 --> 00:18:39,960
[SPEAKER_13]: But we know kids come from our elementary schools and build their knowledge through our middle schools.

228
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:45,082
[SPEAKER_13]: And then they get to the high school, and our high school teachers get to watch them bloom.

229
00:18:45,947 --> 00:18:47,348
[SPEAKER_13]: It's from all the way through.

230
00:18:47,448 --> 00:18:49,391
[SPEAKER_13]: It's an educational experience, K through 12.

231
00:18:49,871 --> 00:18:51,753
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm very proud of the students here tonight.

232
00:18:52,695 --> 00:18:55,518
[SPEAKER_13]: Method's doing really great things in our community.

233
00:18:55,938 --> 00:18:57,781
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm glad to honor so many students.

234
00:18:58,101 --> 00:18:59,242
[SPEAKER_13]: I see a line in front of us.

235
00:18:59,803 --> 00:19:00,904
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you again, Ms.

236
00:19:00,944 --> 00:19:01,085
[SPEAKER_13]: Loeb.

00:19:09,203 --> 00:19:13,145
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion to receive the report in place on the file by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Ms.

238
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:13,385
[SPEAKER_15]: Kreatz.

239
00:19:13,665 --> 00:19:14,325
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

240
00:19:14,345 --> 00:19:14,405
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

241
00:19:15,205 --> 00:19:15,886
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

242
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:16,586
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion passes.

00:19:17,886 --> 00:19:20,027
[SPEAKER_15]: Report on Social Studies Special Events.

244
00:19:20,127 --> 00:19:20,968
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Superintendent.

245
00:19:21,028 --> 00:19:26,790
[SPEAKER_18]: Madam Mayor, members of the committee, we're going to call on Dr. Chiesa again to tell us a little bit about National History Day.

246
00:19:27,494 --> 00:19:39,718
[SPEAKER_18]: and also about our Model UN project, and to recognize several of the students who have participated in both of these activities, both of which are really terrific experiences for them and for the school system.

247
00:19:39,738 --> 00:19:41,679
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm going to turn it over to Dr. Chiesa.

248
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:43,679
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello again.

249
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:44,199
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening.

250
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,720
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to start with National History Day.

251
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:55,363
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very pleased to announce that three Medford High School students and one Andrews Middle School student took part in the Greater Boston District's

252
00:19:55,857 --> 00:19:58,578
[SPEAKER_01]: National History Day that was in Stoneham in early March.

253
00:19:59,478 --> 00:20:12,042
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a very special thank you to our lead teacher, Nicholas Kane, and to Dana McMahon and Michael DiClemente, some of whom are here tonight, for helping the students in this ambitious endeavor.

254
00:20:13,523 --> 00:20:17,504
[SPEAKER_01]: The Medford High School students competed among 200 students in the region.

255
00:20:18,004 --> 00:20:20,965
[SPEAKER_01]: We had Winnie Standovan, Isabel Southwick,

256
00:20:21,338 --> 00:20:24,839
[SPEAKER_01]: Kylie Chong, and Justin Zing competing in the senior division.

257
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:33,063
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the first time in Medford's history, we had an eighth grader, Maria Carmona, participating in the junior division at the middle school.

258
00:20:33,463 --> 00:20:37,885
[SPEAKER_01]: And Maria received an honorable mention, which we're very proud of all of the students for.

259
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:43,316
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do have certificates up there to recognize each student, if I may come up.

260
00:20:43,656 --> 00:20:44,077
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly.

261
00:20:44,097 --> 00:20:44,597
[SPEAKER_01]: Please do.

262
00:20:44,638 --> 00:20:45,118
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

263
00:20:45,559 --> 00:20:49,944
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I could, would you mind if I invite Mr. Kane and Mr. DiClemente over here tonight with us?

264
00:20:49,964 --> 00:20:50,345
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, definitely.

265
00:20:50,365 --> 00:20:52,747
[SPEAKER_15]: And the students, if they'd like to come and stand on the side here.

266
00:21:12,385 --> 00:21:20,489
[SPEAKER_15]: Congratulations, the Medford Public Schools is proud to recognize Winnie Standeven, Exemplary Participation, National History Day, Senior Division.

272
00:22:29,517 --> 00:22:34,399
[SPEAKER_15]: And an honorable mention as well for National History Day Junior Division.

273
00:22:34,459 --> 00:22:42,642
Would you like to say a few words, Mr. King?

274
00:22:46,358 --> 00:22:51,341
[SPEAKER_12]: So it was an absolute pleasure to be able to help these students with their projects.

275
00:22:51,421 --> 00:22:54,983
[SPEAKER_12]: The theme this year was exploration, encounter, and exchange.

276
00:22:55,063 --> 00:23:08,391
[SPEAKER_12]: And the topics that they picked were far more varied than I ever could have imagined, from looking at the development of Chinese opera and how it became an international phenomenon, to looking at the legacy of Joan of Arc and how that changed.

277
00:23:08,411 --> 00:23:10,632
[SPEAKER_12]: It was interpreted different ways over time.

278
00:23:11,733 --> 00:23:20,863
[SPEAKER_12]: to looking at Maria's essay that was titled, My Nanny Speaks Portuguese, and looked at labor history and immigration history and the intersection of the two.

279
00:23:21,784 --> 00:23:27,470
[SPEAKER_12]: It was a joy to work with them, and it was a joy to see the hard work that they put in as they explored the topic.

280
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:31,915
[SPEAKER_12]: So my thanks to them for all their hard work, and it was a pleasure to help them out.

281
00:23:40,561 --> 00:23:48,325
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd just like to add that in June, many more of our students will have projects on this same topic, and we'll be sending invitations to you all.

282
00:23:48,345 --> 00:23:56,189
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have a big presentation at Medford High School, where more students will engage in this, as well as these exhibits will be up as well.

283
00:23:56,269 --> 00:23:58,410
[SPEAKER_01]: So we will invite you and have a formal invitation.

284
00:23:58,450 --> 00:23:59,771
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's welcome to come as well.

285
00:23:59,791 --> 00:24:00,071
[SPEAKER_01]: Wonderful.

286
00:24:00,091 --> 00:24:00,431
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

287
00:24:00,471 --> 00:24:01,272
[SPEAKER_01]: Great, thank you.

288
00:24:01,752 --> 00:24:02,912
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll get the model in here.

289
00:24:02,932 --> 00:24:04,413
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, we have a model.

290
00:24:05,033 --> 00:24:05,934
[SPEAKER_01]: You can sit here if you'd like.

291
00:24:10,807 --> 00:24:12,989
[SPEAKER_15]: And we know what a fabulous teacher Mr. Kane is.

292
00:24:13,009 --> 00:24:18,673
[SPEAKER_15]: He was recognized by the National Honor Society last week as one of the teachers that they wanted to pay tribute to.

293
00:24:18,773 --> 00:24:23,617
[SPEAKER_15]: So he's a special teacher, and we're lucky to have so many of them up at Medford High and throughout our system.

294
00:24:32,984 --> 00:24:33,144

297
00:24:35,566 --> 00:24:37,728
[SPEAKER_06]: Cade to get her notes, I just wanted to say

298
00:24:38,048 --> 00:24:41,409
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll take this opportunity while Mr. Cain is here, before he scoots off.

299
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:46,792
[SPEAKER_06]: Last week, we also had Day of the Hill for the Massachusetts Association of School Committee members.

300
00:24:47,352 --> 00:24:55,576
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was thrilled to have my colleagues Catherine, Catherine, go ahead, Paulette Vindiclou, Mr. Bob Scarry, and myself.

301
00:24:56,196 --> 00:24:59,257
[SPEAKER_06]: But more importantly, we also had representation of our city.

302
00:24:59,377 --> 00:25:04,279
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was wonderful to see that Mr. Cain was there with a wonderful group of high school students.

303
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:06,921
[SPEAKER_06]: We had our vocational students up there.

304
00:25:08,615 --> 00:25:10,516
[SPEAKER_06]: demonstrating their culinary skills.

305
00:25:11,477 --> 00:25:17,121
[SPEAKER_06]: And Mr. Kane had a group of both the high school students and our vocational students.

306
00:25:17,341 --> 00:25:18,442
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was just wonderful.

307
00:25:18,482 --> 00:25:28,048
[SPEAKER_06]: It was our day on the hill to advocate for different issues that are occurring, that have occurred, that are occurring, that we're still fighting for.

308
00:25:28,689 --> 00:25:31,070
[SPEAKER_06]: And it really gave an open eye to our students.

309
00:25:31,231 --> 00:25:35,634
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was just wonderful to see and hear them with their interests.

310
00:25:36,094 --> 00:25:36,934
[SPEAKER_06]: We had an actual

311
00:25:37,995 --> 00:26:04,191
[SPEAKER_06]: session with our students that was set up with younger legislators that had started off as student Councilors and they really had a great interaction of you know questions and answers and you know someday they could be where they were standing and it was really interesting in hearing the students themselves and how they were interested and if I'm not mistaken there was one particular student that I overheard speaking to Mr. Kane that really made me

312
00:26:04,811 --> 00:26:27,019
[SPEAKER_06]: Like extremely proud and excited which he turned around said you know what I thought it was going to be kind of boring But I was like really enthralled and enthralled in the whole day And they were so excited in each and every part and it was just nice to hear that But it was really genuinely nice to see that they were interested in the questions that they had I have to say maybe I was a little bit you know

313
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:32,460
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, proud of the way they presented themselves.

314
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:36,241
[SPEAKER_06]: But I could say that our kids had the best questions out of all the kids that were there.

315
00:26:37,701 --> 00:26:39,661
[SPEAKER_06]: But it was a wonderful day.

316
00:26:39,701 --> 00:26:41,482
[SPEAKER_06]: And it really, I think, gave them a great insight.

317
00:26:41,502 --> 00:26:47,323
[SPEAKER_06]: So I want to say thank you to Mr. Cain, to Dr. Chiesa again for allowing our students to be there.

318
00:26:47,603 --> 00:26:48,443
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just a great day.

343
00:28:37,383 --> 00:28:43,705
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I could ask the teachers if that's OK to join us before the students come up, that would be wonderful.

00:37:17,328 --> 00:37:20,230
[SPEAKER_18]: And now that we are, we're doing exceptionally well.

[SPEAKER_18]: global citizens of the 21st century.

409
00:37:56,456 --> 00:37:58,217

00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:56,440
[SPEAKER_15]: Minutes.

441
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:59,322
[SPEAKER_15]: The meeting was called to order by Chairperson Paulette Van der Kloot.

442
00:38:59,782 --> 00:39:00,603
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Superintendent.

443
00:39:00,723 --> 00:39:03,805
[SPEAKER_18]: Madam Mayor, members of the committee, this was our Curriculum Subcommittee.

444
00:39:04,826 --> 00:39:08,208
[SPEAKER_18]: It was attended by three members and Mrs. DiBenedetto,

445
00:39:09,189 --> 00:39:16,936
[SPEAKER_18]: The minutes are in front of you, if Mrs. Vandekoot would like to highlight something or talk about something in particular, but otherwise you can also waive this as well.

446
00:39:16,956 --> 00:39:19,318
[SPEAKER_19]: No, I would actually prefer not to waive it.

447
00:39:19,678 --> 00:39:22,320
[SPEAKER_19]: It was a very important subcommittee meeting.

448
00:39:22,901 --> 00:39:23,882
[SPEAKER_19]: It was a great meeting.

449
00:39:24,735 --> 00:39:28,016
[SPEAKER_19]: And so, I'd like to review some of what we've talked about.

450
00:39:29,417 --> 00:39:32,378
[SPEAKER_19]: So, we called the meeting to order at 7.05.

451
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:41,781
[SPEAKER_19]: In attendance was myself, Mr. Iscari, Mrs. Mastone, and committee member, Erin DiBenedetto, who is not on the subcommittee, but joined us.

452
00:39:43,581 --> 00:39:45,522
[SPEAKER_19]: Also in attendance were Superintendent Belson,

453
00:39:46,672 --> 00:39:52,734
[SPEAKER_19]: Deputy Superintendent Beverly Nelson, Assistant Superintendent Diane Caldwell, and Director of Curriculum Bernadette Riccidelli.

454
00:39:53,314 --> 00:40:04,337
[SPEAKER_19]: In addition, and most thankfully, I was very grateful that we had five parents who attended, Kate Carson, Michelle Ciccolo, Jennifer Lewis, Cheryl Rodriguez, and Ellery Klein.

455
00:40:05,297 --> 00:40:08,878
[SPEAKER_19]: On the agenda were three items, the park opt-out situation,

456
00:40:09,689 --> 00:40:12,773
[SPEAKER_19]: Then, parent concerns regarding homework policy and practice.

457
00:40:13,414 --> 00:40:19,963
[SPEAKER_19]: And lastly, the state accountability system and Medford performance, with specific discussion around the Roberts School.

458
00:40:20,904 --> 00:40:25,129
[SPEAKER_19]: Superintendent explained the roles and rules governing the subcommittee meeting.

459
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:31,614
[SPEAKER_19]: And we began by talking about the state DESC guidance on opt-out.

460
00:40:32,694 --> 00:40:36,677
[SPEAKER_19]: Deputy Superintendent Nelson provided a handout that identified the state's position.

461
00:40:37,537 --> 00:40:39,979
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think that we're going to be updated with that later on.

462
00:40:40,999 --> 00:40:50,145
[SPEAKER_19]: And so I'm going to skip down now to the part of the meeting where we talked about the parental concerns about the homework policy and practice.

463
00:40:51,371 --> 00:40:58,136
[SPEAKER_19]: Parent Jen Lewis made an initial presentation, and there's items attached to the report.

464
00:40:58,517 --> 00:41:02,100
[SPEAKER_19]: And she raised issues of quantity, quality, and variation among teachers.

465
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:07,924
[SPEAKER_19]: There were particular concern regarding homework in the early grades, and in fact, in kindergarten as well.

466
00:41:08,785 --> 00:41:17,732
[SPEAKER_19]: Also, there were concerns about some teachers using homework as a punishment, which might include the loss of recess time for students not completing homework.

467
00:41:18,722 --> 00:41:24,468
[SPEAKER_19]: Parent Kate Carson, a teacher herself, talked about the stress that homework places on young children and families.

468
00:41:25,189 --> 00:41:39,825
[SPEAKER_19]: And she brought an exchange that she had with Tufts professor Martha Potts, speaking about homework and what really is the point of homework and how to have homework that's really valuable.

469
00:41:40,933 --> 00:41:46,099
[SPEAKER_19]: Parent Michelle Chickalow felt that the nightly homework that her student was getting was too much.

470
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:52,626
[SPEAKER_19]: Parent Ellarie Klein said that the students showed that homework for early learners is not effective.

471
00:41:53,588 --> 00:41:58,173
[SPEAKER_19]: However, parent Cheryl Rodriguez was more pro-homework and felt it played a valuable role.

472
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:07,355
[SPEAKER_19]: Assistant Superintendent Diane Caldwell spoke to us and she said that the goal for homework was 10 minutes per grade.

473
00:42:07,815 --> 00:42:15,760
[SPEAKER_19]: In kindergarten, maybe just reading with the student, but in first grade, 10 minutes, in second grade, 20, et cetera.

474
00:42:15,861 --> 00:42:21,084
[SPEAKER_19]: And it seemed like that was not consistent with the parents that we were hearing.

475
00:42:21,364 --> 00:42:28,309
[SPEAKER_19]: And so for the parent who was happier with the homework, it seemed like it fell within that reasonable time.

476
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:37,175
[SPEAKER_19]: But overall, parents talked about the stress of homework in their lives and saying that it became such a

477
00:42:38,603 --> 00:42:43,107
[SPEAKER_19]: very negative thing rather than a positive learning situation for their children.

478
00:42:43,888 --> 00:42:48,452
[SPEAKER_19]: You note that I embellished that a little bit on our written minutes.

479
00:42:48,572 --> 00:42:55,197
[SPEAKER_19]: Superintendent Belson spoke on the need to be developmentally appropriate and that using homework as a punishment is not acceptable.

480
00:42:55,558 --> 00:43:01,603
[SPEAKER_19]: He emphasized that homework well done can be important, but that is not to be just a make work activity.

481
00:43:02,083 --> 00:43:12,615
[SPEAKER_19]: And again, reference back to Diane Caldwell talking about the new K-2 program, which is going back to a more developmentally friendly classroom, which should include homework.

482
00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:26,934
[SPEAKER_19]: I talked about our experience with homework from one particular teacher at the fifth grade level who had flexible homework, which was to say all the assignments needed to be done by a particular time.

483
00:43:27,394 --> 00:43:34,837
[SPEAKER_19]: But during the week, the student and family could pick which days they might spend time on homework, as long as it was done by a certain date.

484
00:43:34,977 --> 00:43:35,837
[SPEAKER_19]: And that kind of

485
00:43:36,225 --> 00:43:43,789
[SPEAKER_19]: flexibility in today's chaotic world for parents who are both coming home from work really, really would be appreciated.

486
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:47,812
[SPEAKER_19]: The committee will study the parent proposal and report back.

487
00:43:48,412 --> 00:43:52,995
[SPEAKER_19]: Meanwhile, the administrators will reinforce best practices with our teaching faculty.

488
00:43:54,556 --> 00:43:59,558
[SPEAKER_19]: The meeting then moved to the topic of the state accountability system and the Medford performance in 2015.

489
00:43:59,859 --> 00:44:01,860
[SPEAKER_19]: There was particular emphasis on the Roberts School.

490
00:44:04,644 --> 00:44:12,328
[SPEAKER_19]: Superintendent began by saying that we should begin the review with the accountability status focusing on the big picture.

491
00:44:13,029 --> 00:44:18,011
[SPEAKER_19]: Medford Public Schools has eight schools that are eligible for accountability ratings by DESC.

492
00:44:19,132 --> 00:44:21,693
[SPEAKER_19]: Only one school has been designated as a Level 3 school.

493
00:44:21,893 --> 00:44:25,115
[SPEAKER_19]: That designation was one point below the Level 2 threshold.

494
00:44:25,882 --> 00:44:29,247
[SPEAKER_19]: Medford High School and the vocational school are both designated as level one.

495
00:44:29,948 --> 00:44:36,238
[SPEAKER_19]: And the superintendent goes on to give us some comparisons to neighboring communities.

496
00:44:36,839 --> 00:44:38,802
[SPEAKER_19]: For example, Waltham Elementary,

497
00:44:40,571 --> 00:44:44,935
[SPEAKER_19]: Waltham High, Woburn High, Quincy High, Peabody High, and Malden High are all level three.

498
00:44:45,856 --> 00:44:55,104
[SPEAKER_19]: And if we look at elementary schools, many communities in Redding, Somerville, Waltham, Quincy, Framingham, for example, all fall in level three.

499
00:44:55,704 --> 00:44:58,767
[SPEAKER_19]: However, that really was not what we were concerned about.

500
00:44:58,807 --> 00:45:02,150
[SPEAKER_19]: We were concerned about trying to make sure that all of our students

501
00:45:03,576 --> 00:45:12,159
[SPEAKER_19]: were being educated in the best possible way and how we could improve because we are in the business of improvement.

502
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:22,123
[SPEAKER_19]: So Deputy Superintendent Beverly Nelson made several points about the accountability system and Medford's performance.

503
00:45:22,683 --> 00:45:27,705
[SPEAKER_19]: And then there was a discussion on the population distribution among the schools.

504
00:45:28,145 --> 00:45:32,467
[SPEAKER_19]: The superintendent pointed out that the Roberts had a substantial population of ELL newcomers

505
00:45:33,213 --> 00:45:37,696
[SPEAKER_19]: However, it would be difficult to move them to all other schools because of staffing concentrations.

506
00:45:38,157 --> 00:45:42,700
[SPEAKER_19]: And also, we're not interested in just moving students around to improve score levels.

507
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:47,684
[SPEAKER_19]: What we're interested in is to make sure, again, that we're meeting the needs of the students.

508
00:45:48,745 --> 00:45:52,828
[SPEAKER_19]: So Assistant Superintendent Caldwell spoke on our current and planned interventions.

509
00:45:55,470 --> 00:46:02,676
[SPEAKER_19]: For current and past activities, we're mass supports in grades three, four, and five, and directors working with teachers to disaggregate data.

510
00:46:03,797 --> 00:46:12,643
[SPEAKER_19]: Moving forward, in ELL, we've got two more staff positions for growing ELL population, two paraprofessionals as well.

511
00:46:13,584 --> 00:46:19,248
[SPEAKER_19]: And as you know, we have a very transient population where we have kids who arrive any time during the school year.

512
00:46:19,728 --> 00:46:31,757
[SPEAKER_19]: But moving forward, we discussed the hiring of two math coaches for the elementary schools for grades level two, three, and four, and to continue to work with DSAC for professional development opportunities.

513
00:46:32,706 --> 00:46:37,451
[SPEAKER_19]: Envision our math program is going into the third year and we hope to see more positive results.

514
00:46:37,971 --> 00:46:46,580
[SPEAKER_19]: We're going to intensify classroom review and have grade level meetings and it was suggested and confirmed that we would have more math nights at the school.

515
00:46:47,421 --> 00:46:49,303
[SPEAKER_19]: The discussion turned to the value of coaching.

516
00:46:49,663 --> 00:46:54,668
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Benedetto had concerns about whether the coaches would be considered teacher evaluators and the answer was no.

517
00:46:55,408 --> 00:46:55,568
[SPEAKER_19]: Ms.

518
00:46:55,588 --> 00:47:04,010
[SPEAKER_19]: Mistone commented that coaching was not evaluative, and I spoke about coaches as being as models for teachers.

519
00:47:05,051 --> 00:47:13,593
[SPEAKER_19]: The general finding was that the state DSAC was not providing real assistance, and they were short on answers, so it was a little frustrating, but we'll continue to work with them.

520
00:47:14,213 --> 00:47:18,654
[SPEAKER_19]: The subcommittee concluded that we have challenges ahead, but there were several concrete measures in place.

521
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:24,416
[SPEAKER_19]: The meeting was adjourned with the understanding that we would come back for a further discussion

522
00:47:24,836 --> 00:47:26,598
[SPEAKER_19]: and report on the homework policies.

523
00:47:27,318 --> 00:47:27,779
[SPEAKER_15]: Very good.

524
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:29,700
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much, Chairwoman.

525
00:47:30,461 --> 00:47:32,583
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there a motion on the floor to accept the report?

526
00:47:34,084 --> 00:47:36,146
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion to accept the report, seconded by Ms.

527
00:47:36,166 --> 00:47:36,566
[SPEAKER_15]: Cuno.

528
00:47:36,606 --> 00:47:37,427
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

529
00:47:38,227 --> 00:47:39,068
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

530
00:47:39,128 --> 00:47:40,149
[SPEAKER_15]: The report is accepted.

531
00:47:40,349 --> 00:47:40,489
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

532
00:47:40,529 --> 00:47:40,890
[SPEAKER_15]: Vanderpool?

533
00:47:41,090 --> 00:47:47,996
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I just want to again mention how valuable it was that the parents came and participated in the subcommittee meeting, and I was very grateful for that.

534
00:47:48,925 --> 00:47:52,508
[SPEAKER_15]: And the addition of coaches was mentioned in our budget meeting last week.

535
00:47:52,628 --> 00:47:56,691
[SPEAKER_15]: So that is in our files to pay special attention to as the budget proceeds.

536
00:47:57,412 --> 00:47:58,072
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much.

537
00:48:02,416 --> 00:48:03,236
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Superintendent.

538
00:48:04,337 --> 00:48:16,707
[SPEAKER_18]: So Madam Mayor and members of the committee, just as an off agenda item, but something to make sure that everyone is fully aware of is we were honored to have in our presence at the Medford family network, uh, this past week on Friday,

539
00:48:17,252 --> 00:48:19,514
[SPEAKER_18]: The speaker of the Massachusetts House, Robert DiLeo.

540
00:48:21,775 --> 00:48:31,242
[SPEAKER_18]: Speaker DiLeo came with Assistant Majority Leader Donato, Christine Bobber, and Sean Garbley, our two reps, also representing the city.

541
00:48:32,703 --> 00:48:40,729
[SPEAKER_18]: Mayor Burke was there, School Committee Member Van der Kloot, and School Committee Member Mustone, and School Committee Member Kreatz.

542
00:48:41,329 --> 00:48:41,629
[SPEAKER_18]: Were there?

543
00:48:41,829 --> 00:48:42,390
[SPEAKER_18]: No, weren't there.

544
00:48:42,410 --> 00:48:42,810
[SPEAKER_18]: Came later.

545
00:48:42,930 --> 00:48:43,150
[SPEAKER_18]: OK.

546
00:48:43,651 --> 00:48:46,312
[SPEAKER_09]: So national on the site.

547
00:48:46,333 --> 00:48:46,773
[SPEAKER_18]: Get mixed up.

548
00:48:47,442 --> 00:48:49,063
[SPEAKER_18]: We had nice representation.

549
00:48:50,945 --> 00:49:03,535
[SPEAKER_18]: We had a wonderful presentation by two parents who had participated, two parents who came from a different country, who really expressed how it helped them make the transition.

550
00:49:03,955 --> 00:49:06,317
[SPEAKER_18]: I think the speaker was very impressed with that.

551
00:49:06,758 --> 00:49:09,500
[SPEAKER_18]: The program was co-sponsored by the Children's Trust.

552
00:49:10,401 --> 00:49:13,063
[SPEAKER_18]: Susan Bartley is the executive director of the Children's Trust.

553
00:49:14,087 --> 00:49:23,109
[SPEAKER_18]: The Children's Trust is the premier organization in this state that works to prevent child abuse and works to strengthen families.

554
00:49:24,349 --> 00:49:41,973
[SPEAKER_18]: Susan Barkley has been very active for many, many years, and it's her goal to take the model created by the Medford Family Network in the early 90s, it's 22 years in existence now, and the work of Marie Cassidy, who's been our lead player in that organization for many years,

555
00:49:42,592 --> 00:49:43,753
[SPEAKER_18]: to take that statewide.

556
00:49:44,493 --> 00:49:57,420
[SPEAKER_18]: And basically, the pitch with the speaker was that this is the way you reduce child abuse, this is the way you help DCF meet their challenges, and this is the way you promote good gateway education into the community.

557
00:49:58,021 --> 00:50:04,444
[SPEAKER_18]: And as the mayor emphasized also, that it was critical that we do these things so that when youngsters come to school, they're ready to learn.

558
00:50:05,265 --> 00:50:11,068
[SPEAKER_18]: And they have family supports and parents know what's expected of them, and we can move our agenda forward.

559
00:50:11,519 --> 00:50:33,793
[SPEAKER_18]: So it was a thrill to have the speaker here, to have such a strong delegation from our legislature there, and to have the program that we hold so dear, the Medford Family Network, raised to such a high level of praise by Susan Bartley, who I indicate is sort of the leader in the state for child abuse prevention and for strengthening families.

560
00:50:34,851 --> 00:50:35,972
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you Mr. Superintendent.

561
00:50:36,012 --> 00:50:37,392
[SPEAKER_15]: If I could just a quick comment.

562
00:50:37,432 --> 00:50:40,894
[SPEAKER_15]: I think a lot of us have benefited from the Medford Family Network through the years.

563
00:50:40,974 --> 00:50:51,140
[SPEAKER_15]: I know I certainly participated with my youngsters who are now teenagers and above and it's just a fabulous program and I urge all new parents and parents of young children to participate.

564
00:50:51,563 --> 00:50:58,990
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a great advocacy program, learning opportunity, and just socialization with parents as well as the children themselves.

565
00:50:59,051 --> 00:51:08,180
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's a fabulous program and we're very proud to have Marie Cassidy and the support of the school system throughout the years having supported this program.

566
00:51:10,616 --> 00:51:14,759
[SPEAKER_19]: It was a great presentation the other day, and I was very honored to be able to attend.

567
00:51:15,279 --> 00:51:23,544
[SPEAKER_19]: I think, you know, you can't help but feel proud when you realize that what we have in Medford is the goal for the rest of the state.

568
00:51:24,405 --> 00:51:25,766
[SPEAKER_19]: And that was very, very clear.

569
00:51:26,846 --> 00:51:29,608
[SPEAKER_19]: That's, you know, part of the reason why the speaker came out.

570
00:51:30,343 --> 00:51:33,645
[SPEAKER_19]: was because we were being held up as the exemplary program.

571
00:51:34,486 --> 00:51:45,532
[SPEAKER_19]: It would be remiss if I did not happen to mention, since I'm old enough to remember, but the superintendent was key in developing the Medford Family Network, and it was through his work that it came into being.

572
00:51:46,293 --> 00:51:46,673
[SPEAKER_15]: Very good.

573
00:51:46,733 --> 00:51:47,153
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Ms.

574
00:51:47,173 --> 00:51:47,674
[SPEAKER_15]: Van der Kloot.

575
00:51:47,694 --> 00:51:47,734
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

576
00:51:48,954 --> 00:51:50,836
[SPEAKER_15]: Puno, did you wish to speak on this topic?

577
00:51:52,136 --> 00:51:52,757
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Benedetto?

578
00:51:53,237 --> 00:51:53,917
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Benedetto.

579
00:51:54,118 --> 00:51:54,478
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

580
00:51:54,858 --> 00:51:59,781
[SPEAKER_13]: I actually have another topic about legislators, so I thought I would speak on it now, if that's okay.

581
00:52:01,058 --> 00:52:21,055
[SPEAKER_13]: I know a few months ago, Mr. Skerry and I met with Christine Barber and Sean Gobley about homelessness in the state of Massachusetts and specifically about transporting homeless children and maybe redirecting some of those funds into being proactive rather than reactive and help families stay in their homes.

582
00:52:21,436 --> 00:52:24,699
[SPEAKER_13]: But the school system here in Medford, we've spent already over $100,000 transporting

583
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:28,262
[SPEAKER_13]: homeless students to and from school.

584
00:52:28,642 --> 00:52:32,306
[SPEAKER_13]: And those students don't all live in Medford any longer.

585
00:52:32,366 --> 00:52:41,235
[SPEAKER_13]: They sometimes live in hotels or motels or shelters, and it's still Padawa's responsibility to give them a safe place to come to school every day.

586
00:52:41,936 --> 00:52:48,382
[SPEAKER_13]: But given that work, Christine Barber and I sat down in Mississippi, too,

587
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:55,123
[SPEAKER_13]: to write an amendment to this year's budget and it passed the State House of Representatives.

588
00:52:55,424 --> 00:53:07,672
[SPEAKER_13]: And the purpose was to form a commission to review the costs and challenges to finding homeless students, transportation services, and to make recommendations on how to improve this system.

589
00:53:08,618 --> 00:53:34,184
[SPEAKER_13]: Before July of 2017, the commission will create a report that will include a review of the federal McKinley-Vento Homeless Children and Youth Assistance Act, a budget assessment, a review of methods used by school districts now to bid and to procure transportation, a review of the best practices in other states, and finally, recommendations for improvement.

590
00:53:34,524 --> 00:53:37,325
[SPEAKER_13]: So just as an example, I work at a neighboring district.

591
00:53:38,606 --> 00:53:55,301
[SPEAKER_13]: And if I have a homeless student that lives in a homeless shelter in Dorchester, just to put it in perspective, that needs to go to school in Cambridge, I pay, along with the City of Medford, $275 a day to transport one child to school.

592
00:53:55,641 --> 00:53:56,702
[SPEAKER_13]: That's not their housing.

593
00:53:56,822 --> 00:53:57,823
[SPEAKER_13]: That's not their food.

594
00:53:58,163 --> 00:54:00,345
[SPEAKER_13]: That's just to get them to and from school.

595
00:54:00,926 --> 00:54:02,267
[SPEAKER_13]: And that is like $6,000 a month.

596
00:54:04,242 --> 00:54:07,625
[SPEAKER_13]: We need to change how we do this in the state of Massachusetts.

597
00:54:07,705 --> 00:54:30,702
[SPEAKER_13]: And when Mr. Belson presented us with some facts and figures a few months ago, and how much Medford was paying, and then actually in my other job, my day job, of actually getting kids and families' rights to school, and how difficult it is to get people because there's not enough drivers, I saw a bigger picture here.

598
00:54:31,142 --> 00:54:33,084
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're working towards fixing it.

599
00:54:34,051 --> 00:54:35,172
[SPEAKER_13]: And this is the first step.

600
00:54:35,252 --> 00:54:38,134
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a small step, but it went through the House, now it will go through the Senate.

601
00:54:38,415 --> 00:54:41,758
[SPEAKER_13]: So if any of you know senators, please give them a call.

602
00:54:42,118 --> 00:54:47,603
[SPEAKER_13]: Tell them you support this amendment so it stays on there, so we can have a commission and really talk about

603
00:54:48,117 --> 00:54:55,339
[SPEAKER_13]: what's working, what's not working, and how we keep families in homes rather than in homeless shelters and driving them back and forth from there to school.

604
00:54:55,519 --> 00:54:56,399
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for your time.

605
00:54:56,419 --> 00:54:57,300
[SPEAKER_13]: I really appreciate it.

606
00:54:57,540 --> 00:54:59,020
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much, Mr. Benedetto.

607
00:54:59,480 --> 00:54:59,620
Ms.

608
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:00,020
[SPEAKER_06]: Cuno?

609
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:06,542
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a point of information, with all due respect, and this is great that you're working on this, Erin, and Mr. Scarrialso.

610
00:55:07,402 --> 00:55:09,903
[SPEAKER_06]: This is something that has been worked on for the last

611
00:55:10,386 --> 00:55:11,587
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been in this now 11 years.

612
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:26,999
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe it's been nine years that school committee member at the time, Mary Jo Rosetti, and at the time it was Representative Kyle Scortino who had brought up this bill and had been working on this bill of transportation and mobility.

613
00:55:27,759 --> 00:55:33,004
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's been an ongoing, it's been ongoing for many years.

614
00:55:33,464 --> 00:55:36,887
[SPEAKER_06]: So I believe it's now Christine who, because of Kyle not being here,

615
00:55:39,123 --> 00:55:42,546
[SPEAKER_06]: Christine is now bringing it along and bringing it forward.

616
00:55:42,886 --> 00:55:50,552
[SPEAKER_06]: But it is a transport and mobility issue and a bill that they've been trying to be pushing it for many, many years.

617
00:55:50,932 --> 00:55:54,435
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's great that now we have more support on this.

618
00:55:54,575 --> 00:55:58,658
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just want to make it clear that it is something that has been going on for many years.

619
00:56:00,019 --> 00:56:05,683
[SPEAKER_19]: I just wanted to thank my colleagues, Irwin DiBenedetto and Bob Scurry, for their work on this.

620
00:56:06,384 --> 00:56:06,744
[SPEAKER_15]: Very good.

621
00:56:06,924 --> 00:56:07,605
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much.

622
00:56:09,283 --> 00:56:10,503
[SPEAKER_15]: Community participation.

623
00:56:10,563 --> 00:56:15,425
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there anyone in the audience that would like to step forward for the community participation segment?

624
00:56:15,445 --> 00:56:19,386
[SPEAKER_15]: Hearing and seeing none.

625
00:56:22,767 --> 00:56:24,808
[SPEAKER_15]: Pre-budget report English.

626
00:56:26,188 --> 00:56:26,468
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

627
00:56:26,528 --> 00:56:27,128
[SPEAKER_15]: Nelson.

628
00:56:27,148 --> 00:56:28,989
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, is Ms.

629
00:56:29,029 --> 00:56:30,029
[SPEAKER_15]: Nelson for five?

630
00:56:30,069 --> 00:56:30,289
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

631
00:56:30,629 --> 00:56:32,330
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, you know, they're sort of related.

632
00:56:34,643 --> 00:56:44,505
[SPEAKER_18]: But in this instance, we'll call upon our deputy superintendent to introduce someone who she just met this past week.

633
00:56:46,505 --> 00:56:46,705
[SPEAKER_14]: Ms.

634
00:56:46,745 --> 00:56:51,146
[SPEAKER_14]: Nelson.

635
00:56:51,206 --> 00:56:51,786
[SPEAKER_16]: Good evening.

636
00:56:51,806 --> 00:56:57,567
[SPEAKER_16]: We're going to continue this evening with our pre-budget presentations.

637
00:56:58,888 --> 00:57:01,148
[SPEAKER_16]: Last week at the meeting of the whole, we heard

638
00:57:02,152 --> 00:57:06,275
[SPEAKER_16]: believe it was three or four, and tonight we have an additional three.

639
00:57:06,315 --> 00:57:16,003
[SPEAKER_16]: We're going to hear from the English Department and the Social Studies Department, and then from our Health Services Department.

640
00:57:16,743 --> 00:57:21,707
[SPEAKER_16]: We've asked our presenters to prepare a cover sheet for you.

641
00:57:21,747 --> 00:57:25,350
[SPEAKER_16]: They'll address most of the items on the cover sheet.

642
00:57:25,390 --> 00:57:27,191
[SPEAKER_16]: You have the extensive reports.

643
00:57:27,231 --> 00:57:28,713
[SPEAKER_16]: Hopefully you've had a chance to review them.

644
00:57:29,353 --> 00:57:30,574
[SPEAKER_16]: And again, they'll be bringing up

645
00:57:30,972 --> 00:57:33,634
[SPEAKER_16]: basically some of their needs for the upcoming year.

646
00:57:34,155 --> 00:57:39,779
[SPEAKER_16]: So we'll start with the English department and I think I know this person, Dr. Chiesa.

647
00:57:51,148 --> 00:57:52,009
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening again.

648
00:57:52,029 --> 00:57:52,649
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you?

649
00:57:53,810 --> 00:57:56,252
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to start with a brief description of the program.

650
00:57:56,492 --> 00:57:58,514
[SPEAKER_01]: The English language arts department, as you know,

651
00:57:59,455 --> 00:58:03,558
[SPEAKER_01]: is aligned to the 2011 Massachusetts English Language Arts Curriculum Framework.

652
00:58:04,139 --> 00:58:09,483
[SPEAKER_01]: At the elementary level, instructional materials include the Journeys Common Core and additional trade books.

653
00:58:10,043 --> 00:58:20,111
[SPEAKER_01]: At the middle and high school level, we have the Houghton Mifflin anthologies, periodicals, fictional, informational texts, along with e-readers.

654
00:58:20,852 --> 00:58:24,895
[SPEAKER_01]: There are 27 teachers in the middle school, high school, and vocational departments.

655
00:58:25,015 --> 00:58:27,937
[SPEAKER_01]: Specifically, there are seven teachers at the Andrews Middle School.

656
00:58:28,525 --> 00:58:36,327
[SPEAKER_01]: seven English teachers at the McGlynn Middle School, 11 teachers at Medford High School, and two teachers at Medford Vocational Technical High School.

657
00:58:37,907 --> 00:58:46,929
[SPEAKER_01]: When we look at the use of funding for this past school year, 2015 to 2016, the use of funding was consistent with the appropriated budget funding.

658
00:58:47,389 --> 00:58:54,471
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll speak to some of the accomplishments, which thanks to your support, we were able to accomplish through the budget this year.

659
00:58:55,911 --> 00:58:57,712
[SPEAKER_01]: When we look at the accomplishments for this year,

660
00:58:58,893 --> 00:59:05,737
[SPEAKER_01]: big accomplishments for the English Language Arts Department was purchasing 100 e-readers at both the middle school and high school level.

661
00:59:06,258 --> 00:59:13,622
[SPEAKER_01]: By doing this, we, in the end, saved a great deal of money because we are reducing the need for replacement text.

662
00:59:14,143 --> 00:59:22,648
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally, when we have books that we hold physically, the durability wears on them quickly.

663
00:59:23,377 --> 00:59:27,798
[SPEAKER_01]: The students also had an option for those of the classrooms that participated in the e-readers.

664
00:59:27,918 --> 00:59:32,679
[SPEAKER_01]: Students certainly had an option to use the regular books, but they could also use the e-readers.

665
00:59:33,299 --> 00:59:41,000
[SPEAKER_01]: Also with the e-readers, there are many books that are free on the public domain, and at times less expensive when purchased through Amazon.

666
00:59:41,220 --> 00:59:43,080
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was a great purchase for the department.

667
00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:47,181
[SPEAKER_01]: The kids were excited that it participated, as well as the teachers.

668
00:59:47,381 --> 00:59:49,702
[SPEAKER_01]: And we thank the school committee for their support for that.

669
00:59:52,107 --> 00:59:58,492
[SPEAKER_01]: Other accomplishments for the year was one you saw tonight and one you saw previous months ago, the Scholastic Writing Awards.

670
00:59:59,433 --> 01:00:04,097
[SPEAKER_01]: This year, we worked to refine the district-determined measures to meet curriculum demands.

671
01:00:04,697 --> 01:00:13,204
[SPEAKER_01]: We established personalized data folders for all English teachers, grades six through 11, so that they could have greater access and analysis to MCAS data.

672
01:00:14,105 --> 01:00:21,211
[SPEAKER_01]: We fully integrated grades nine and 10 for the high school and vocational English language arts classes, which allowed our vocational students

673
01:00:21,652 --> 01:00:24,114
[SPEAKER_01]: to take classes without any restriction.

674
01:00:24,795 --> 01:00:33,282
[SPEAKER_01]: We also implemented two inclusion co-teaching classes at the high school that spanned both the ninth and tenth grade at the high school and at the vocational school.

675
01:00:34,202 --> 01:00:39,106
[SPEAKER_01]: Additionally, we established ELA Google share drives for grades three to five.

676
01:00:39,567 --> 01:00:46,973
[SPEAKER_01]: That allowed for more consistency throughout the elementary schools so that teachers were able to virtually speak with each other through these drives

677
01:00:47,683 --> 01:00:52,066
[SPEAKER_01]: which improved the consistency of instruction even more than it already was.

678
01:00:52,527 --> 01:01:05,537
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also had elementary and middle school students participate in some mock park exams to establish testing comfort, ease, so that they would meet the test that they took this week with less anxiety.

679
01:01:07,178 --> 01:01:16,025
[SPEAKER_01]: If I move to the request for the budget for school year 2016 to 2017, you will see that the office supplies have remained the same.

680
01:01:16,506 --> 01:01:18,387
[SPEAKER_01]: There is an increase in textbooks.

681
01:01:18,847 --> 01:01:26,230
[SPEAKER_01]: The increase in textbooks speaks directly to the increase in classrooms at the elementary level to support the journey's materials.

682
01:01:26,790 --> 01:01:30,192
[SPEAKER_01]: We've looked at the different grade increases throughout the district.

683
01:01:30,832 --> 01:01:40,436
[SPEAKER_01]: If one grade increased at one school and another grade decreased at another school, we were able to move those materials to share, so we weren't repeating any of that.

684
01:01:40,836 --> 01:01:44,958
[SPEAKER_01]: However, we did find for additional, we have a few additional elementary classrooms

685
01:01:45,436 --> 01:01:52,200
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would equate to $5,000 in journey's materials to meet the needs of that classroom rooms.

686
01:01:53,540 --> 01:02:01,265
[SPEAKER_01]: For instructional supplies, this year the instructional supply increase speaks to three specific items.

687
01:02:01,885 --> 01:02:06,187
[SPEAKER_01]: The first is assessments for grade the middle school.

688
01:02:06,587 --> 01:02:10,550
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an intervention assessment so that we can more accurately

689
01:02:11,669 --> 01:02:14,631
[SPEAKER_01]: notice what the needs of the students are at the middle school.

690
01:02:14,851 --> 01:02:21,896
[SPEAKER_01]: The Andrews Middle School has done this in years past, and we want to make sure that they are able to continue as well as the McGlynn Middle School.

691
01:02:22,236 --> 01:02:34,564
[SPEAKER_01]: Through these assessments, students are assessed throughout the different quarters, and should they need extra intervention, RTI, in a certain area, we can then meet their needs based on this.

692
01:02:35,699 --> 01:02:41,600
[SPEAKER_01]: Similarly, the other two requests for instructional supplies speak to the Journeys materials.

693
01:02:42,181 --> 01:02:50,323
[SPEAKER_01]: Journeys has released a new item that is more closely aligned with the upcoming new assessments.

694
01:02:50,463 --> 01:03:00,065
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, we don't know exactly what MCAS 2.0 is going to look like, but we have a strong sense that it will be similar to some of the park exams that we have.

695
01:03:00,325 --> 01:03:01,966
[SPEAKER_01]: And what the company has created

696
01:03:04,483 --> 01:03:08,384
[SPEAKER_01]: is a small book that meets these needs.

697
01:03:08,444 --> 01:03:15,026
[SPEAKER_01]: It has more of the, when you look at the new types of testing, you're looking at more textual evidence.

698
01:03:15,066 --> 01:03:18,347
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they're asking the student a question, they're following up with textual evidence.

699
01:03:18,887 --> 01:03:23,768
[SPEAKER_01]: The written responses are looking at different three passages instead of just one.

700
01:03:24,728 --> 01:03:27,309
[SPEAKER_01]: The Journeys has published a book that works with that.

701
01:03:27,389 --> 01:03:30,650
[SPEAKER_01]: So I propose that we get one per classroom teacher so we could

702
01:03:31,621 --> 01:03:33,403
[SPEAKER_01]: we could have it that way.

703
01:03:33,583 --> 01:03:38,227
[SPEAKER_01]: The last piece is, the last one for that is also journeys readers notebooks.

704
01:03:38,607 --> 01:03:48,595
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the consumable for journeys and those would be specifically for our ELL and any struggling intervention to students.

705
01:03:49,116 --> 01:03:56,442
[SPEAKER_01]: Those consumables would help to intervene for our struggling readers and our ELL students as well.

706
01:03:58,239 --> 01:04:01,101
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also making a request for additional staffing.

707
01:04:01,281 --> 01:04:04,323
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking for one extra FTE at the high school.

708
01:04:05,303 --> 01:04:15,069
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now the English department is operating only with 13 high school teachers as opposed to 14 and 15 for the other departments that have four year requirements.

709
01:04:15,469 --> 01:04:21,773
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been operating since 2010, I believe we lost one staff member that we did not replace.

710
01:04:22,249 --> 01:04:33,615
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been able to meet and deal with those increases for class sizes, but at this point, we've hit our wall, and we really need one extra person at the high school to meet the demands.

711
01:04:34,455 --> 01:04:51,163
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also requests for a .5 person at the middle school, and that person would be working on intervention for reading for our struggling students, as well as our ELL population, which, as you know, is significantly increasing year by year.

712
01:04:51,947 --> 01:04:55,050
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank the school committee for last year for the budget.

713
01:04:55,130 --> 01:04:56,551
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did wonderful things.

714
01:04:56,631 --> 01:04:57,952
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks to all of your support.

715
01:04:58,592 --> 01:05:00,374
[SPEAKER_01]: And I greatly appreciate that.

716
01:05:00,474 --> 01:05:01,094
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.

717
01:05:01,114 --> 01:05:03,596
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

718
01:05:03,616 --> 01:05:04,017
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Benedetto?

719
01:05:04,157 --> 01:05:04,577
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

720
01:05:06,399 --> 01:05:07,419
[SPEAKER_13]: Great accomplishments.

721
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:09,621
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot of work this year.

722
01:05:09,641 --> 01:05:09,961
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

723
01:05:10,001 --> 01:05:10,982
[SPEAKER_13]: And it really shows.

724
01:05:11,162 --> 01:05:14,285
[SPEAKER_13]: And it shows by the awards that were given out this evening as well.

725
01:05:14,405 --> 01:05:15,266
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

726
01:05:16,006 --> 01:05:17,968
[SPEAKER_13]: So kudos to all of that.

727
01:05:18,368 --> 01:05:19,369
[SPEAKER_13]: I just had a question.

728
01:05:19,793 --> 01:05:27,259
[SPEAKER_13]: The increase in the amount of children in our elementary school, and it might not be directed to you, it might be, Madam Mayor, to the superintendent.

729
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:39,090
[SPEAKER_13]: Has there been an increase, an enrollment increase in recent years that we have more students in our elementary school that we need to add more journeys, stuff?

730
01:05:40,050 --> 01:05:41,612
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, the enrollment's been pretty stable.

731
01:05:42,384 --> 01:05:43,305
[SPEAKER_18]: at this point in time.

732
01:05:43,866 --> 01:05:47,390
[SPEAKER_18]: The shift sometimes is the grade levels and, you know, the distributions.

733
01:05:48,451 --> 01:05:51,956
[SPEAKER_18]: So we want to take things away from people who already have them.

734
01:05:51,976 --> 01:05:52,977
[SPEAKER_18]: We may need a little bit of a shift.

735
01:05:53,418 --> 01:06:01,988
[SPEAKER_18]: I can tell you that as of today, based on what we've seen in previous years, we're 49 students ahead in kindergarten enrollment at this point in time.

736
01:06:02,655 --> 01:06:04,278
[SPEAKER_18]: which tells us that people are coming home.

737
01:06:04,699 --> 01:06:13,014
[SPEAKER_13]: So just to follow up on that, I know there's been a lot of building and a lot more condos and apartment buildings in the community.

738
01:06:13,054 --> 01:06:13,816
[SPEAKER_13]: And I know there's room.

739
01:06:17,535 --> 01:06:20,236
[SPEAKER_13]: And we just want to keep that in mind for our services.

740
01:06:21,157 --> 01:06:43,165
[SPEAKER_13]: So Mayor Burke, I hope that when they build or propose a lot of apartments and buildings, that we keep in mind how many teachers and how many firefighters and how many police officers we'd have to add to the community to make sure that we have safe streets and really good educators in our school and we're not overcrowding anywhere.

741
01:06:43,225 --> 01:06:45,266
[SPEAKER_13]: I know we're not even close to overcrowding,

742
01:06:45,650 --> 01:06:53,078
[SPEAKER_13]: But I want to make sure we keep the ratio that we currently have, and the supply costs, and how it will affect us as a community as a whole.

743
01:06:53,559 --> 01:06:58,364
[SPEAKER_13]: So could you just please keep an eye on that and keep us informed as that happens?

744
01:06:58,404 --> 01:07:02,308
[SPEAKER_13]: Because we're already almost 50 children higher for this.

745
01:07:04,011 --> 01:07:09,892
[SPEAKER_13]: This year enrollment, and this is very early to have that many, because there's a lot that come through the summer as well.

746
01:07:11,513 --> 01:07:22,335
[SPEAKER_13]: That means that we might need to be careful with staffing and make sure that we have enough staff for September and add classrooms in which schools and which areas they're going to need.

747
01:07:22,655 --> 01:07:24,956
[SPEAKER_13]: So any updates on that, I'd appreciate that.

748
01:07:25,416 --> 01:07:26,776
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, thank you for the report.

749
01:07:26,796 --> 01:07:29,537
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll do our best to help you with the items that you request.

750
01:07:30,115 --> 01:07:32,900
[SPEAKER_13]: There's always a lot of requests and it's hard to prioritize.

751
01:07:33,281 --> 01:07:36,286
[SPEAKER_13]: If you had to pick one thing that was really important.

752
01:07:47,782 --> 01:08:00,272
[SPEAKER_01]: I would also say that the high school, at this point, having just 13 teachers, it's critical to add that one with inclusion and other demands based on curriculum.

753
01:08:01,653 --> 01:08:03,995
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say they're all important.

754
01:08:04,335 --> 01:08:08,458
[SPEAKER_01]: I know how much work we have to do, so I try to vet out the ones that aren't.

755
01:08:08,498 --> 01:08:10,540
[SPEAKER_01]: But that one is definitely a big one as well.

756
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:14,363
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for prioritizing, and thank you for your work on the report.

757
01:08:14,383 --> 01:08:15,463
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

758
01:08:15,503 --> 01:08:15,563
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

759
01:08:15,583 --> 01:08:16,064
[SPEAKER_15]: Mustone.

760
01:08:16,704 --> 01:08:17,525
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for being here.

761
01:08:18,128 --> 01:08:23,212
[SPEAKER_03]: I give you credit for being down one English teacher since 2010, so I think that is definitely a top priority.

762
01:08:23,533 --> 01:08:25,915
[SPEAKER_03]: The other question was the .5 for the middle school.

763
01:08:26,055 --> 01:08:28,257
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that for the Andrews or the McGlynn, or would they share the .5?

764
01:08:28,397 --> 01:08:30,198
[SPEAKER_01]: I talked to one of the principals.

765
01:08:30,298 --> 01:08:34,201
[SPEAKER_01]: At this point, the English language learners have some of the McGlynn.

766
01:08:34,342 --> 01:08:39,606
[SPEAKER_01]: We're thinking that they may be better staffers, they may be better servants.

767
01:08:48,698 --> 01:08:52,879
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very sensitive to his needs as well, so wanted to make sure.

768
01:08:53,079 --> 01:09:09,204
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, the way in which the scheduling, because it's different, a slightly different reading by arts, he's able to do the intervention in the reading with his schedule, and it's not as easily done currently at the other equivalent, and that's why we're leaning towards that.

769
01:09:09,264 --> 01:09:15,266
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, should things change, I didn't designate it per se for that very reason.

770
01:09:17,511 --> 01:09:18,992
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much, Doctor.

771
01:09:19,012 --> 01:09:24,854
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion to accept the English Language Arts Pre-Budget Report, seconded by Ms.

772
01:09:24,874 --> 01:09:25,354
[SPEAKER_15]: Van der Kloot.

773
01:09:25,374 --> 01:09:26,055
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

774
01:09:26,075 --> 01:09:26,555
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

775
01:09:26,635 --> 01:09:27,255
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

776
01:09:27,275 --> 01:09:28,856
[SPEAKER_15]: The report is accepted.

777
01:09:28,876 --> 01:09:29,276
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

778
01:09:32,377 --> 01:09:34,758
[SPEAKER_15]: Social Studies Pre-Budget Report.

779
01:09:36,319 --> 01:09:36,739
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm back.

780
01:09:36,779 --> 01:09:37,399
[SPEAKER_15]: Does it all.

781
01:09:37,419 --> 01:09:37,780
[SPEAKER_14]: Dr. Keetha.

782
01:09:45,732 --> 01:09:47,973
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, I know, you know, when it was squealing, I shut it off.

783
01:09:48,073 --> 01:09:48,513
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry.

784
01:09:48,533 --> 01:09:49,214
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

785
01:09:49,234 --> 01:09:49,954
[SPEAKER_01]: You can turn it off.

786
01:09:50,014 --> 01:09:51,775
[SPEAKER_01]: I can speak louder if you want.

787
01:09:52,615 --> 01:09:56,817
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully for the social studies report, you'll see I have a cover page there as well.

788
01:09:56,897 --> 01:10:01,319
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I have a more in-depth report, which hopefully you've had time to look at.

789
01:10:01,899 --> 01:10:12,784
[SPEAKER_01]: The social studies department very quickly is committed to providing all students with academic and problem-solving schools essential for the development, responsible citizenship, and lifelong learning.

790
01:10:13,202 --> 01:10:19,225
[SPEAKER_01]: Currently, we have 26 teachers, social studies teachers, in the middle school, high school, and vocational department.

791
01:10:19,646 --> 01:10:22,067
[SPEAKER_01]: We have six teachers at each of the middle schools.

792
01:10:22,487 --> 01:10:28,030
[SPEAKER_01]: We have 13 teachers at Medford High School, and we have one teacher at the Medford Vocational Technical High School.

793
01:10:29,631 --> 01:10:37,055
[SPEAKER_01]: This year, for funding, once again, similar to English Language Arts, I want to take a minute to thank all of you for your support of the social studies department.

794
01:10:37,356 --> 01:10:39,637
[SPEAKER_01]: We were able to accomplish a great deal as you

795
01:10:40,391 --> 01:10:43,313
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully saw tonight and as you've seen throughout the year as well.

796
01:10:44,094 --> 01:10:51,819
[SPEAKER_01]: We were fairly consistent with the budget that you provided with us, with the exception of field trip items, which we had an increase in.

797
01:10:52,200 --> 01:11:04,449
[SPEAKER_01]: I was able to allocate some of the funds to meet all of the demands, but we did see an increase in the field trip, which again, through grants and some reallocation, we were able to meet the needs of.

798
01:11:05,129 --> 01:11:08,812
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll talk about that briefly when I go through my requests for next year.

799
01:11:09,460 --> 01:11:22,887
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we focus on the accomplishments for this year for a minute, this year, for school year 2015 to 2016, we were able to implement 35 additional Google Chromebooks for our Global Scholars Program.

800
01:11:23,227 --> 01:11:24,128
[SPEAKER_01]: That was huge.

801
01:11:24,488 --> 01:11:26,769
[SPEAKER_01]: The teachers were able to use them in the classroom.

802
01:11:26,849 --> 01:11:29,770
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you've heard about the Global Scholars Program before.

803
01:11:30,331 --> 01:11:32,012
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a thriving program.

804
01:11:32,072 --> 01:11:35,974
[SPEAKER_01]: The engagement for those students is absolutely amazing.

805
01:11:36,054 --> 01:11:38,655
[SPEAKER_01]: As a former seventh grade teacher myself,

806
01:11:39,149 --> 01:11:44,413
[SPEAKER_01]: I am thrilled when I walk into a classroom and see how engaged they are in the learning for social studies.

807
01:11:44,873 --> 01:11:49,396
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Google Chromebooks was very instrumental in supporting that program, so I thank you for that.

808
01:11:50,177 --> 01:11:56,301
[SPEAKER_01]: We've also had a very significant increase in our community partnerships for authentic learning opportunities.

809
01:11:56,721 --> 01:11:58,042
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of those you saw tonight.

810
01:11:58,402 --> 01:12:01,364
[SPEAKER_01]: We had great success and an increase with National History Day.

811
01:12:01,784 --> 01:12:06,988
[SPEAKER_01]: We were able to implement a middle school model United Nations group, as you saw tonight.

812
01:12:07,327 --> 01:12:14,728
[SPEAKER_01]: We were also able to resurrect our mock trial program, and they traveled throughout the state, participating in different competitions throughout the year.

813
01:12:15,129 --> 01:12:18,549
[SPEAKER_01]: We hadn't had that for a few years, so it was very exciting for the department.

814
01:12:19,609 --> 01:12:25,431
[SPEAKER_01]: We participated in Law Day, we participated in Student Government Day, and as Ms.

815
01:12:25,571 --> 01:12:29,471
[SPEAKER_01]: Cuno mentioned, we participated on Day on the Hill just last week.

816
01:12:30,832 --> 01:12:36,993
[SPEAKER_01]: This year, in addition to that, we've worked hard as a department to refine our district-determined measures to meet the curriculum demands.

817
01:12:37,665 --> 01:12:48,312
[SPEAKER_01]: We have fully integrated grades 9 and 10 for all social studies classrooms between the vocational and the high school, again allowing students to take classes without restriction.

818
01:12:48,772 --> 01:12:55,617
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have also implemented two inclusion grade 9 co-teaching classes at the high school and the vocational school.

819
01:12:56,617 --> 01:13:00,000
[SPEAKER_01]: One other thing I want to mention is that we have either reinstated or

820
01:13:01,198 --> 01:13:04,419
[SPEAKER_01]: created four new senior level classes.

821
01:13:05,099 --> 01:13:09,000
[SPEAKER_01]: We brought back government and law, which hadn't been there for a year or two.

822
01:13:09,561 --> 01:13:14,742
[SPEAKER_01]: We have had great success in the economics class, which you have known about in years past.

823
01:13:14,782 --> 01:13:19,724
[SPEAKER_01]: But we now are thriving with two economics classes for our grade 12 students.

824
01:13:20,504 --> 01:13:26,846
[SPEAKER_01]: And additionally, we were able to bring back our advanced placement comparative government class.

825
01:13:27,166 --> 01:13:27,846
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's huge.

826
01:13:27,906 --> 01:13:30,607
[SPEAKER_01]: Those classes are populated with quite a number of students

827
01:13:31,391 --> 01:13:38,675
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's very exciting for the department to see how alive it is, even in the senior year, where social studies is only a three-year requirement.

828
01:13:39,056 --> 01:13:40,556
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been wonderful to see, really.

829
01:13:40,576 --> 01:13:41,237
[SPEAKER_01]: It really has.

830
01:13:42,698 --> 01:13:47,000
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of requests for funding, the requests remain the same.

831
01:13:48,161 --> 01:13:59,307
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, I failed to mention another accomplishment for this year, thanks to your support, was the purchase of the AP European textbooks for grade 10, and also the beginning purchases of the grade eight

832
01:14:00,980 --> 01:14:02,440
[SPEAKER_01]: the Grade 8 U.S.

833
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:03,721
[SPEAKER_01]: History textbooks.

834
01:14:03,921 --> 01:14:14,984
[SPEAKER_01]: As you recall, last year you were kind enough to provide funds to support one classroom set per teacher of the new books for the Social Studies Grade 8 classrooms.

835
01:14:15,704 --> 01:14:21,666
[SPEAKER_01]: This year, the budget requests remain the same, with an increase in field trips moving from 2,000 to 4,500.

836
01:14:21,706 --> 01:14:22,206
[SPEAKER_01]: The cost of buses

837
01:14:26,853 --> 01:14:31,954
[SPEAKER_01]: and the increase in the number of opportunities that we've let our students participate in.

838
01:14:32,374 --> 01:14:35,575
[SPEAKER_01]: It's quite expensive, and we've done our best to defray the costs.

839
01:14:35,675 --> 01:14:41,977
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we want to keep supporting these groups, that's really where I see the biggest increase for us.

840
01:14:43,537 --> 01:14:48,058
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much, again, for all of your support of the department, because it's wonderful.

841
01:14:48,258 --> 01:14:48,638
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

842
01:14:48,938 --> 01:14:49,699
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much.

843
01:14:50,159 --> 01:14:50,899
[SPEAKER_15]: Are there any questions?

844
01:14:54,829 --> 01:14:59,373
[SPEAKER_03]: Just one question about the 35 Google Chromebooks.

845
01:15:00,314 --> 01:15:03,377
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that enough or do you think that program is looking to expand?

846
01:15:04,658 --> 01:15:07,341
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm keeping that in to expand as well.

847
01:15:07,421 --> 01:15:09,823
[SPEAKER_01]: So that came from instructional supplies last year.

848
01:15:10,283 --> 01:15:13,927
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, we're looking to add more to the classroom.

849
01:15:14,387 --> 01:15:17,310
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of the Google Chromebooks is also

850
01:15:17,758 --> 01:15:21,460
[SPEAKER_01]: Purchasing the carts to keep them safe and keep them charging.

851
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:36,166
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's one extra cost that we factored into this year So yes, we we're still planning for next year to continue with that purchase as well Thank you so much, thank you

852
01:15:44,570 --> 01:15:46,831
[SPEAKER_15]: School Health Services Pre-Budget Report 1617.

853
01:15:46,931 --> 01:15:48,111
[SPEAKER_15]: Good evening.

854
01:15:53,713 --> 01:15:57,534
[SPEAKER_22]: Good evening, Mayor Burke, school committee members, Superintendent Belson.

855
01:15:58,594 --> 01:16:00,815
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll give you a little bit of overview of the program.

856
01:16:01,135 --> 01:16:02,515
[SPEAKER_22]: Several of you are new.

857
01:16:02,935 --> 01:16:11,558
[SPEAKER_22]: We have 11 and a half full-time employees in the nursing service department, 12 DESE certified school nurses,

858
01:16:12,534 --> 01:16:18,539
[SPEAKER_22]: We have one RN who's a medical paraprofessional and one LPN who's a classroom paraprofessional.

859
01:16:19,159 --> 01:16:23,982
[SPEAKER_22]: And you can see from the list the breakdown of where these nurses are covering in all the schools.

860
01:16:26,024 --> 01:16:41,275
[SPEAKER_22]: Presently, all of the schools have additional nursing staff, except for the Andrews, which has one nurse, the Roberts, one nurse, and the Curtis-Tufts, which has variable nursing services during the week, about three to five hours per week coverage.

861
01:16:43,746 --> 01:16:54,116
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'd like to stress a little bit on how nursing has changed in the school environment over the years, especially the last 20 years.

862
01:16:54,396 --> 01:16:58,940
[SPEAKER_22]: And at that point, that was the start of the essential school health services grant.

863
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:06,287
[SPEAKER_22]: And Medford's been very fortunate to be receiving money for the last 25 years from the state to help support our school nurse.

864
01:17:07,445 --> 01:17:08,026
[SPEAKER_22]: department.

865
01:17:08,846 --> 01:17:12,609
[SPEAKER_22]: And in those years, there were a few students with chronic illnesses.

866
01:17:14,690 --> 01:17:24,997
[SPEAKER_22]: If we look, we fast forward to today, we have many students with chronic illnesses, diabetes, epilepsy, cardiac problems.

867
01:17:25,637 --> 01:17:36,604
[SPEAKER_22]: We have children with cancer, and that has greatly impacted the acuity of the students' health needs in the schools.

868
01:17:38,608 --> 01:17:42,711
[SPEAKER_22]: All of these children are now here because of the wonderful advances in pediatric medicine.

869
01:17:44,753 --> 01:17:55,202
[SPEAKER_22]: So where 20 years ago we, school nurses, focused on band-aids, maybe some medications during the day, that has all changed.

870
01:17:55,382 --> 01:18:01,707
[SPEAKER_22]: So now we have students with tube feedings, students who walk through the schools with portable defibrillators.

871
01:18:02,628 --> 01:18:03,889
[SPEAKER_22]: We have students who

872
01:18:04,445 --> 01:18:07,446
[SPEAKER_22]: need insulin adjustments two to four times a day.

873
01:18:08,587 --> 01:18:19,812
[SPEAKER_22]: We have 168 EpiPens in our district and at any one point a student can have a reaction like you all received a telephone call today that happened in one of our schools.

874
01:18:20,432 --> 01:18:33,598
[SPEAKER_22]: And then the growing number of students with social emotional learning needs and these students present to us often first with a physical ailment or complaint and that is attended to in the nursing department as they

875
01:18:34,102 --> 01:18:40,805
[SPEAKER_22]: The school nurses try to sort that out and figure out where the best place is for the students to be taken care of.

876
01:18:42,386 --> 01:18:52,251
[SPEAKER_22]: An emergency with any of these students at any one time can tie up a nurse for a couple of hours and that can draw them away from the rest of the student population.

877
01:18:53,472 --> 01:18:59,975
[SPEAKER_22]: We're also adding new mandates from the Department of Public Health for substance abuse screening in the upcoming year.

878
01:19:01,274 --> 01:19:09,118
[SPEAKER_22]: And then there's a new wave that we've recognized this year of international students who are coming to us with very complex medical needs.

879
01:19:09,158 --> 01:19:15,580
[SPEAKER_22]: And this has corresponded to the growth in the international health services at the Boston Pediatric Hospitals.

880
01:19:17,341 --> 01:19:20,623
[SPEAKER_22]: Families are coming in because they want care for a very sick child.

881
01:19:21,023 --> 01:19:24,324
[SPEAKER_22]: They will enroll the entire family in the school district.

882
01:19:24,705 --> 01:19:27,726
[SPEAKER_22]: And then we also have the care of that very sick child.

883
01:19:29,112 --> 01:19:34,455
[SPEAKER_22]: This year that amounted to four preschool students who entered the system.

884
01:19:37,357 --> 01:19:44,481
[SPEAKER_22]: So we're very grateful over the last couple of years that there have been several funding that we received.

885
01:19:44,501 --> 01:19:56,108
[SPEAKER_22]: We were grateful to replace all of our AEDs about a year and a half ago, and we have state-of-the-art AEDs through some assistance with Armstrong Ambulance.

886
01:19:57,890 --> 01:20:04,313
[SPEAKER_22]: Despite the volume of student health encounters and the acuity, we are returning 97.2 students back to class.

887
01:20:04,873 --> 01:20:12,696
[SPEAKER_22]: So students are no longer going home if they have an asthma problem in school or if their diabetes is a little bit out of control.

888
01:20:13,036 --> 01:20:15,577
[SPEAKER_22]: We're keeping them in school and we're managing them.

889
01:20:17,378 --> 01:20:26,822
[SPEAKER_22]: Another accomplishment this year is that we wrote protocols and procedures for the administration of Narcan and all of our school nurses now carry

890
01:20:27,577 --> 01:20:35,323
[SPEAKER_22]: Narcan in the schools should we need to respond to any overdose situation within the school environment or on the school grounds.

891
01:20:36,685 --> 01:20:48,334
[SPEAKER_22]: And then we also received additional funds from the essential school health services grant for SBIRT screening, which is a new mandate that was signed into legislation this year by Governor Baker.

892
01:20:48,854 --> 01:20:56,961
[SPEAKER_22]: And that speaks to screening students in grade nine next year and then grade seven the year after.

893
01:20:57,515 --> 01:21:01,137
[SPEAKER_22]: for risk behaviors that are associated with substance abuse.

894
01:21:02,238 --> 01:21:06,420
[SPEAKER_22]: For students who screen positive, they are referred on to additional treatment.

895
01:21:09,542 --> 01:21:16,026
[SPEAKER_22]: So my special request for next year would be to meet the acuity needs of our system.

896
01:21:16,626 --> 01:21:21,369
[SPEAKER_22]: We're very fortunate that to date we've been very well staffed.

897
01:21:22,429 --> 01:21:27,252
[SPEAKER_22]: We do carry some very good ratios above the state guidelines.

898
01:21:27,777 --> 01:21:32,742
[SPEAKER_22]: But as we looked at data, I'm very aware that we could use more.

899
01:21:33,643 --> 01:21:40,270
[SPEAKER_22]: I'd like to ask for two full-time employees and that would be spread amongst the schools.

900
01:21:40,710 --> 01:21:47,577
[SPEAKER_22]: I'd like to see coverage at the Curtis Tufts and at the Andrews and the Roberts additional coverage.

901
01:21:53,261 --> 01:21:54,222
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Benedetto?

902
01:21:54,542 --> 01:21:54,882
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

903
01:21:54,902 --> 01:21:58,485
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to say thank you so much for a great report, Ms.

904
01:21:58,525 --> 01:21:58,886
[SPEAKER_13]: Vento.

905
01:21:58,906 --> 01:21:59,386
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

906
01:21:59,466 --> 01:22:00,187
[SPEAKER_13]: I appreciate it.

907
01:22:01,227 --> 01:22:08,914
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, I just wanted to take this opportunity to talk about the nursing staff stepping up with the substance abuse issue in the community.

908
01:22:09,374 --> 01:22:15,399
[SPEAKER_13]: Because in our elementary schools, maybe a nurse doesn't need to carry knock-in for our students.

909
01:22:15,817 --> 01:22:22,678
[SPEAKER_13]: But maybe for one of their parents that are dropping them off or picking them up, or another relative that's there visiting the school at an event.

910
01:22:23,638 --> 01:22:31,000
[SPEAKER_13]: So the fact that you had total compliance throughout your department is really touching and very appreciated.

911
01:22:31,340 --> 01:22:33,720
[SPEAKER_13]: And I just wanted to go on record stating that.

912
01:22:34,060 --> 01:22:34,401
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

913
01:22:34,421 --> 01:22:37,141
[SPEAKER_22]: They are a very professional group of school nurses.

914
01:22:37,501 --> 01:22:39,021
[SPEAKER_13]: We're fortunate to have them.

915
01:22:42,464 --> 01:22:46,466
[SPEAKER_13]: new check-in with, I believe it's the ninth graders, right?

916
01:22:46,486 --> 01:22:47,307
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, the screening.

917
01:22:47,527 --> 01:22:48,968
[SPEAKER_22]: And that's starting in September?

918
01:22:49,188 --> 01:22:50,769
[SPEAKER_22]: It will be starting in the next school year.

919
01:22:50,909 --> 01:22:54,531
[SPEAKER_22]: We aim for a January screening time.

920
01:22:55,231 --> 01:22:55,871
[SPEAKER_13]: That's probably better.

921
01:22:55,911 --> 01:23:02,655
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd like the kids to get in and get settled and then just really see the reality of what they're like once they're settled into high school.

922
01:23:02,755 --> 01:23:06,937
[SPEAKER_22]: It works well within the curriculum framework as well.

923
01:23:07,898 --> 01:23:11,600
[SPEAKER_22]: We're looking to do it during phys ed classes or health ed classes, but

924
01:23:12,411 --> 01:23:17,253
[SPEAKER_22]: That month really works well with other curriculum initiatives that are really important.

925
01:23:17,833 --> 01:23:34,439
[SPEAKER_13]: So, not directed at you, Mayor Burke, through you to the superintendent, Mr. Bellson, how are we communicating this fact that this screening is going to be taking place with our students in January of next year for our freshmen?

926
01:23:35,939 --> 01:23:37,300
[SPEAKER_19]: How are we going to communicate it?

927
01:23:38,943 --> 01:23:41,104
[SPEAKER_22]: I think I can answer that for you.

928
01:23:41,504 --> 01:23:43,365
[SPEAKER_22]: At this time, we have a planning committee.

929
01:23:44,405 --> 01:23:47,846
[SPEAKER_22]: This is part of what we use the funding from the Department of Public Health for.

930
01:23:48,426 --> 01:23:52,327
[SPEAKER_22]: We're developing a whole resource booklet that we would like to bring to school committee.

931
01:23:52,347 --> 01:23:54,268
[SPEAKER_22]: It includes letters to parents.

932
01:23:54,408 --> 01:24:04,691
[SPEAKER_22]: It includes all the information about what the screening is, how it's conducted, and we would bring that to a school committee meeting so all of you would be informed of that.

933
01:24:04,751 --> 01:24:07,852
[SPEAKER_22]: We'd also look at extending

934
01:24:09,779 --> 01:24:13,083
[SPEAKER_22]: for parents if that's needed, or getting information on websites.

935
01:24:14,124 --> 01:24:23,375
[SPEAKER_22]: All parents will have the opportunity to opt out of the screening, and so we will make all those instructions very clear.

936
01:24:24,829 --> 01:24:39,609
[SPEAKER_13]: could we possibly use our PR person to make sure that people in the community know that we're doing these types of screenings and that we're really serious about substance abuse in our community and we're here to help any student that needs help and it's not to be to

937
01:24:40,684 --> 01:24:45,986
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not to be punitive, it's really to help students and help families that might need help.

938
01:24:46,587 --> 01:24:52,009
[SPEAKER_13]: And I know the screening not only screens them for themselves, but also if they're dealing with a family member as well, right?

939
01:24:52,029 --> 01:24:53,289
[SPEAKER_22]: Do they have those questions?

940
01:24:53,369 --> 01:24:54,130
[SPEAKER_22]: Not entirely.

941
01:24:54,510 --> 01:24:54,870
[SPEAKER_22]: OK.

942
01:24:54,970 --> 01:24:57,811
[SPEAKER_13]: It's really more about the student's specific risk behaviors.

943
01:24:58,271 --> 01:24:58,912
[SPEAKER_13]: OK, great.

944
01:24:59,232 --> 01:24:59,472
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

945
01:24:59,532 --> 01:25:01,793
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, that's good to know, too, for my education.

946
01:25:02,561 --> 01:25:08,127
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you again for your report, and I'm going to ask you the same question that I asked Dr. Chiesa.

947
01:25:08,568 --> 01:25:09,869
[SPEAKER_13]: What are your top priorities?

948
01:25:09,929 --> 01:25:11,410
[SPEAKER_13]: What are your top needs?

949
01:25:11,751 --> 01:25:20,460
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, we'd love to fill every position that's requested from us, but that's really not possible for us to do, and we need to know what people's first priorities are.

950
01:25:20,980 --> 01:25:25,245
[SPEAKER_22]: I would say having more nursing presence at the Curtis Tough School.

951
01:25:30,728 --> 01:25:39,492
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, we could do it with a half time.

952
01:25:39,952 --> 01:25:41,133
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for all this information.

953
01:25:41,353 --> 01:25:49,377
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just on page 6 where it says EpiPens were purchased through a free program sponsored by Mylan Specialty for a savings of $10,000.

954
01:25:50,097 --> 01:25:51,518
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know just from my own children, we

955
01:25:52,015 --> 01:25:54,301
[SPEAKER_03]: I've provided the EpiPen.

956
01:25:54,703 --> 01:25:59,054
[SPEAKER_22]: This is a stock EpiPen, so this is for students who...

957
01:25:59,639 --> 01:26:05,484
[SPEAKER_22]: have their first reaction in school and have no medication, no prescribed medication in school.

958
01:26:05,824 --> 01:26:07,145
[SPEAKER_22]: So we can meet that need.

959
01:26:07,205 --> 01:26:19,035
[SPEAKER_22]: We would also be able to meet that need for, since we carry an adult version, we could meet that for staff who might have a reaction that don't know they're allergic to any substance.

960
01:26:19,655 --> 01:26:21,477
[SPEAKER_22]: And I know they expire typically in a year.

961
01:26:21,517 --> 01:26:21,917
[SPEAKER_22]: They do.

962
01:26:22,698 --> 01:26:25,100
[SPEAKER_22]: We're fortunate every year to be able to renew that.

963
01:26:25,340 --> 01:26:25,720
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, you get this.

964
01:26:25,740 --> 01:26:25,900
[SPEAKER_22]: OK, great.

965
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:26,401
[SPEAKER_22]: We've done that.

966
01:26:26,421 --> 01:26:28,502
[SPEAKER_22]: This is the third year that we've participated.

967
01:26:28,903 --> 01:26:29,203
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

968
01:26:34,079 --> 01:26:35,139
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

969
01:26:35,719 --> 01:26:42,903
[SPEAKER_19]: I noted where you said four pre-K students with complex medical needs registered in the district.

970
01:26:43,243 --> 01:26:45,624
[SPEAKER_19]: Are those students in the same classroom?

971
01:26:46,445 --> 01:26:46,825
[SPEAKER_22]: They are.

972
01:26:46,845 --> 01:26:50,787
[SPEAKER_22]: Three of them are enrolled in Brooks.

973
01:26:51,227 --> 01:26:54,929
[SPEAKER_22]: So we finished the registration for them.

974
01:26:55,009 --> 01:26:56,310
[SPEAKER_22]: We have the classroom set up.

975
01:26:56,490 --> 01:27:02,373
[SPEAKER_22]: And we're just getting all the medical information pulled together so they can actually get

976
01:27:02,993 --> 01:27:16,139
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, and it's just prompting the addition of a classroom licensed practical nurse that was in addition this year that was a new position this year in response to these Students that unexpectedly entered the city and so is that

977
01:27:20,743 --> 01:27:27,805
[SPEAKER_19]: position maintained in your budget for next year, so the two additional is on top of that, correct?

978
01:27:28,445 --> 01:27:47,649
[SPEAKER_19]: It's always amazing to me when I see the list of students, you know, 336 diagnosed with allergies, you know, the number with diabetes, the number with, you know, such complex medical needs, and know what great dedication your staff has to keep all the balls in the air safely.

979
01:27:48,280 --> 01:27:50,263
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a juggling game sometimes.

980
01:27:50,303 --> 01:27:50,604
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

981
01:27:52,499 --> 01:27:55,862
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you very much.

982
01:27:56,522 --> 01:28:08,791
[SPEAKER_20]: The message we got today from the Roberts and that was an example of a job well done with the nurse that administered the EpiPen and the way the 911 response and the principal going in the ambulance.

983
01:28:08,851 --> 01:28:10,873
[SPEAKER_20]: It was just wonderful.

984
01:28:10,953 --> 01:28:12,254
[SPEAKER_20]: It was a very smooth event.

985
01:28:12,774 --> 01:28:13,655
[SPEAKER_20]: Extremely smooth.

986
01:28:13,715 --> 01:28:16,677
[SPEAKER_20]: It was handled very well.

987
01:28:16,877 --> 01:28:17,177
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

988
01:28:17,197 --> 01:28:18,899
[SPEAKER_22]: That's what we aim for every single time.

989
01:28:20,677 --> 01:28:21,798
[SPEAKER_15]: Very good, thank you very much.

990
01:28:22,238 --> 01:28:24,079
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there a motion to receive this report?

991
01:28:24,679 --> 01:28:25,260
[SPEAKER_15]: Motions?

992
01:28:26,360 --> 01:28:28,081
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion to receive the report offered by Ms.

993
01:28:28,121 --> 01:28:29,182
[SPEAKER_15]: Bamford, seconded by Ms.

994
01:28:29,202 --> 01:28:29,582
[SPEAKER_15]: Cuno.

995
01:28:29,642 --> 01:28:30,363
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

996
01:28:30,383 --> 01:28:30,963
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

997
01:28:31,023 --> 01:28:31,884
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

998
01:28:31,904 --> 01:28:32,424
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion carries.

999
01:28:32,464 --> 01:28:32,984
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1000
01:28:33,445 --> 01:28:42,570
[SPEAKER_18]: Madam Mayor, just before we move on, just want to note that tonight, one of the contracts that we hope to settle tonight will be the nurse's contract.

1001
01:28:43,370 --> 01:28:47,833
[SPEAKER_18]: They've done an excellent job under Tony's leadership and we think that

1002
01:28:48,330 --> 01:28:51,512
[SPEAKER_18]: we're able to move forward, and they're certainly taking on more and more responsibilities.

1003
01:28:53,333 --> 01:28:53,733
[SPEAKER_15]: Very good.

1004
01:28:53,773 --> 01:28:54,753
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1005
01:28:56,534 --> 01:29:01,497
[SPEAKER_15]: Next item is item seven, recommendation to reject participation in school choice school year 16-17.

1006
01:29:01,617 --> 01:29:03,418
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Superintendent.

1007
01:29:03,518 --> 01:29:06,459
[SPEAKER_18]: This is a requirement that we face every year.

1008
01:29:06,559 --> 01:29:16,184
[SPEAKER_18]: School choice is one of the pieces of legislation that would allow us or would mandate, if we don't reject it, to take a student in from another district at $5,000 based on

1009
01:29:19,214 --> 01:29:20,314
[SPEAKER_18]: availability of seats.

1010
01:29:21,175 --> 01:29:39,866
[SPEAKER_18]: We find that this is not a productive way to increase enrollment and that we have to notify the State Department by June 1st, so we put this on annually and ask that you approve it so that we can formally notify the State Department of Education.

1011
01:29:41,427 --> 01:29:44,829
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a motion to approve by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Ms.

1012
01:29:44,869 --> 01:29:45,769
[SPEAKER_15]: Van der Kloot.

1013
01:29:45,889 --> 01:29:46,990
[SPEAKER_15]: Roll call vote for this.

1014
01:29:55,590 --> 01:29:58,271
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, 7 in the affirmative, 9 in the negative, the motion passes.

1015
01:30:00,711 --> 01:30:04,493
[SPEAKER_15]: Next item is the report on the last day of school for the current year.

1016
01:30:05,213 --> 01:30:07,634
[SPEAKER_18]: So, assuming that it doesn't snow.

1017
01:30:08,274 --> 01:30:10,615
[SPEAKER_15]: One can't assume that.

1018
01:30:10,755 --> 01:30:14,316
[SPEAKER_18]: Or there's anything else that might get in the way of closing.

1019
01:30:15,116 --> 01:30:18,337
[SPEAKER_18]: This year the last day of school will be Tuesday, June 21st, 2016.

1020
01:30:18,417 --> 01:30:18,938
[SPEAKER_18]: It says 2015 here, so.

1021
01:30:23,587 --> 01:30:25,328
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyone who doesn't show up tomorrow will be in trouble.

1022
01:30:27,108 --> 01:30:28,108
[SPEAKER_18]: It'll be a 12 p.m.

1023
01:30:28,388 --> 01:30:30,409
[SPEAKER_18]: Release for all schools.

1024
01:30:31,269 --> 01:30:39,131
[SPEAKER_18]: The completion of school on this day enables us to meet the state required 180 instructional days minimum and the total hourly minimums for each grade level.

1025
01:30:39,992 --> 01:30:42,572
[SPEAKER_18]: We have a schedule for elementary and middle and high school.

1026
01:30:43,673 --> 01:30:51,135
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll post that on our webpage and through other channels and make sure that parents receive it from their schools as well.

1027
01:30:53,396 --> 01:30:57,918
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion to receive in place by on file by Mr. Skerry, seconded by Ms.

1028
01:30:57,938 --> 01:30:58,519
[SPEAKER_15]: Van der Kloot.

1029
01:30:58,599 --> 01:30:59,299
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

1030
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:00,600
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

1031
01:31:00,700 --> 01:31:01,480
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion passes.

1032
01:31:03,582 --> 01:31:08,504
[SPEAKER_15]: Recommendation to approve school committee meeting calendar for 16-17 school year.

1033
01:31:08,704 --> 01:31:12,767
[SPEAKER_18]: So we like to post these meetings as early as we can so that people can plan.

1034
01:31:12,787 --> 01:31:18,910
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, this is, uh, we're starting earlier, uh, this year coming up in August.

1035
01:31:19,969 --> 01:31:29,634
[SPEAKER_18]: But these are the meeting dates that won't conflict with various holy days or other considerations that we would consider to be, let's say, not good practice.

1036
01:31:30,074 --> 01:31:30,274
[SPEAKER_19]: Ms.

1037
01:31:30,314 --> 01:31:30,894
[SPEAKER_19]: Vander Ploot.

1038
01:31:31,455 --> 01:31:34,196
[SPEAKER_19]: Personally, I don't think it's good practice to have a meeting on Halloween.

1039
01:31:34,216 --> 01:31:37,277
[SPEAKER_18]: You don't want a meeting on Halloween?

1040
01:31:37,537 --> 01:31:37,758
[SPEAKER_19]: Right.

1041
01:31:38,278 --> 01:31:38,998
[SPEAKER_18]: So I would.

1042
01:31:39,058 --> 01:31:40,759
[SPEAKER_18]: Consider it if we want to come in costume.

1043
01:31:41,310 --> 01:31:50,156
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, no, because I believe that there are certain members who need to be home with their students, uh, their children and the other members who need to be at home giving out candy.

1044
01:31:50,736 --> 01:31:56,680
[SPEAKER_19]: So if we could please, uh, look at the calendar again and change that October 31st meeting.

1045
01:31:57,320 --> 01:31:57,621
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

1046
01:31:58,101 --> 01:32:05,406
[SPEAKER_18]: So if we could approve the calendar tonight and we will come back to the next meeting with a change on October 31st, unless you choose to come in costume.

1047
01:32:05,546 --> 01:32:05,986
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. Skerry.

1048
01:32:08,585 --> 01:32:12,807
[SPEAKER_05]: for the February 13th, 2017 meeting to February 27th?

1049
01:32:14,728 --> 01:32:15,889
[SPEAKER_18]: We can always make that move.

1050
01:32:15,929 --> 01:32:17,870
[SPEAKER_18]: The only thing is it comes right after school vacation.

1051
01:32:17,890 --> 01:32:18,730
[SPEAKER_18]: We put two meetings in a row.

1052
01:32:18,750 --> 01:32:19,290
[SPEAKER_18]: But we can do that.

1053
01:32:19,310 --> 01:32:20,391
[SPEAKER_18]: If you want to do that, we can do it.

1054
01:32:21,792 --> 01:32:22,172
[SPEAKER_15]: OK.

1055
01:32:22,352 --> 01:32:28,335
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion to accept the school committee meeting schedule for next year as amended, all those in favor?

1056
01:32:28,775 --> 01:32:28,875
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

1057
01:32:28,975 --> 01:32:29,415
[SPEAKER_04]: Roll call.

1058
01:32:30,196 --> 01:32:30,656
[SPEAKER_15]: Roll call.

1059
01:32:30,996 --> 01:32:31,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1060
01:32:31,797 --> 01:32:32,937
[SPEAKER_15]: Roll call, as amended.

1061
01:32:33,337 --> 01:32:34,038
[SPEAKER_04]: Mrs. Cuno.

1062
01:32:34,878 --> 01:32:35,519
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Benedetto.

1063
01:32:35,559 --> 01:32:35,619
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1064
01:32:36,539 --> 01:32:36,699
[SPEAKER_04]: Ms.

1065
01:32:36,739 --> 01:32:37,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Kreatz.

1066
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:37,840
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1067
01:32:37,860 --> 01:32:37,900
[SPEAKER_04]: Ms.

1068
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:38,340
[SPEAKER_04]: Mustone.

1069
01:32:38,926 --> 01:32:39,626
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Schara, yes.

1070
01:32:39,646 --> 01:32:39,746
[SPEAKER_04]: Ms.

1071
01:32:39,786 --> 01:32:40,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Van der Kloot?

1072
01:32:40,467 --> 01:32:40,567
Yes.

1073
01:32:40,587 --> 01:32:40,627
Ms.

1074
01:32:41,167 --> 01:32:41,588
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybrook?

1075
01:32:41,828 --> 01:32:42,148
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1076
01:32:42,288 --> 01:32:44,629
[SPEAKER_15]: Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

1077
01:32:45,190 --> 01:32:47,251
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you want to speak on this before I call the final?

1078
01:32:47,271 --> 01:32:48,211
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, please.

1079
01:32:48,251 --> 01:32:48,832
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Benedetto?

1080
01:32:49,132 --> 01:33:08,323
[SPEAKER_13]: I just wanted to have the superintendent email us with any updates on the opening of school and how it went and if there were any issues or bus issues because this is a late start to me, but I understand because of religious holidays, that's why it's scheduled at this point, at least that's what I'm assuming.

1081
01:33:09,865 --> 01:33:11,106
[SPEAKER_13]: But I would like updates.

1082
01:33:11,306 --> 01:33:17,048
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll send you a full update with the opening of school well in advance of the meeting.

1083
01:33:17,068 --> 01:33:17,668
[SPEAKER_15]: OK, thank you.

1084
01:33:18,608 --> 01:33:20,128
[SPEAKER_15]: Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

1085
01:33:20,148 --> 01:33:21,729
[SPEAKER_15]: The motion passes as amended.

1086
01:33:21,749 --> 01:33:31,412
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there a motion for suspension of the rules to move negotiations and legal matters to the end of the agenda?

1087
01:33:31,652 --> 01:33:32,292
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion for approval.

1088
01:33:32,912 --> 01:33:33,913
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion for approval.

1089
01:33:34,033 --> 01:33:34,793
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

1090
01:33:35,113 --> 01:33:35,253
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

1091
01:33:35,613 --> 01:33:36,313
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

1092
01:33:37,094 --> 01:33:37,834
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion passes.

1093
01:33:40,533 --> 01:33:46,076
[SPEAKER_15]: Also, is there a motion on the floor to offer condolences, Mr. Skerry?

1094
01:33:47,857 --> 01:33:48,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Out of order?

1095
01:33:48,838 --> 01:33:49,478
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1096
01:33:50,018 --> 01:33:51,179
[SPEAKER_15]: School committee resolution.

1097
01:33:51,239 --> 01:33:56,082
[SPEAKER_15]: Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Maria DeLiva.

1098
01:33:56,602 --> 01:34:00,044
[SPEAKER_15]: Mrs. DeLiva was the grandmother of Andrew's principal, Paul DeLiva.

1099
01:34:01,170 --> 01:34:08,056
[SPEAKER_15]: Also, while we're into suspension, we have, be it resolved, the Medford School Committee sends its condolences to the family of Whitfield, Jeff Jeffers.

1100
01:34:08,577 --> 01:34:14,122
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Jeffers was a longtime Medford resident who was active in civic affairs in the West Medford Community Center.

1101
01:34:21,649 --> 01:34:25,633
[SPEAKER_15]: If we could all please rise for a moment of silence on the passing of these two individuals.

1102
01:34:43,251 --> 01:34:52,356
[SPEAKER_15]: New business, discussion of the RFP development for winter season bubble structure on the field of dreams, which is the edgily field for proper naming.

1103
01:34:52,996 --> 01:34:53,817
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Superintendent.

1104
01:34:54,417 --> 01:35:07,644
[SPEAKER_18]: Madam Mayor, members of the committee, after a number of meetings on this matter, because it involves real estate negotiations, the committee went into session to discuss some of the possibilities.

1105
01:35:09,457 --> 01:35:16,502
[SPEAKER_18]: we put this together as a compilation of what you thought was important to be included in specifications.

1106
01:35:17,122 --> 01:35:24,628
[SPEAKER_18]: Should we decide to go forward with a winter season bubble over the elderly field or sometimes referred to as the field of dreams?

1107
01:35:25,688 --> 01:35:30,412
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, so it requires your approval for it to go to an RFP development.

1108
01:35:31,092 --> 01:35:33,294
[SPEAKER_18]: Once the RFP is developed, it would then go out.

1109
01:35:33,954 --> 01:35:37,997
[SPEAKER_18]: And of course, any awarding of a lease of any kind would then come back to the school committee.

1110
01:35:38,630 --> 01:35:40,431
[SPEAKER_18]: uh, before it was actually implemented.

1111
01:35:41,071 --> 01:35:48,815
[SPEAKER_18]: But these are the terms and conditions that we would ask to be put into the, um, RFP.

1112
01:35:49,595 --> 01:36:06,683
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, and if there's any amendments to them, obviously we would make them this evening if we decided to go forward, uh, with the permission of, uh, mayor, I would read through them for public consumption and also, uh, to allow you some time to reflect on each one so that you may have some thoughts

1113
01:36:07,477 --> 01:36:08,758
[SPEAKER_18]: as we continue our discussion.

1114
01:36:09,818 --> 01:36:20,423
[SPEAKER_18]: Number one, the contract must include a parking lot for an additional 100 cars on the non-turf practice field adjacent to the turf fields paid for by the vendor.

1115
01:36:20,503 --> 01:36:22,224
[SPEAKER_18]: That's the West courtyard field.

1116
01:36:23,484 --> 01:36:29,407
[SPEAKER_18]: Two, the contract must include provisions for a field house with adequate indoor bathroom facilities.

1117
01:36:30,027 --> 01:36:33,649
[SPEAKER_18]: It should have a heater installed since it's going to be used during the winter months.

1118
01:36:34,345 --> 01:36:38,028
[SPEAKER_18]: All costs of installation and maintenance must be borne by the contractor.

1119
01:36:38,889 --> 01:36:47,115
[SPEAKER_18]: Three, the programs operated by the vendor must make substantial provisions for discounting participation fees for Medford youth and residents.

1120
01:36:48,036 --> 01:37:00,906
[SPEAKER_18]: One of the things that in checking with Mr. Scarpelli, who is actively involved in recreational matters in Somerville and is knowledgeable of our facilities as well, in Somerville they look at a 50% discount.

1121
01:37:01,747 --> 01:37:03,108
[SPEAKER_18]: We could change that, add to it,

1122
01:37:03,836 --> 01:37:12,104
[SPEAKER_18]: you know, as, as the case may be, but we could, you know, that's, that's nothing that we have to, uh, uh, decide immediately when we can come back to that.

1123
01:37:12,644 --> 01:37:13,725
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, it should be in the RFP.

1124
01:37:13,825 --> 01:37:14,806
[SPEAKER_18]: It should be in the RFP.

1125
01:37:14,886 --> 01:37:15,307
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

1126
01:37:16,088 --> 01:37:29,040
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, and that would be not only for Medford youth, but also for residents for the hours of operation must be established in such a way as to avoid conflict with Medford programs and to avoid late night impact on a butters.

1127
01:37:30,276 --> 01:37:33,018
[SPEAKER_18]: The contract may not operate programs beyond 11 p.m.

1128
01:37:33,198 --> 01:37:33,998
[SPEAKER_18]: on any evening.

1129
01:37:35,399 --> 01:37:41,122
[SPEAKER_18]: Six, all operational costs associated with the rented program must be borne by the company or vendor.

1130
01:37:41,823 --> 01:37:47,766
[SPEAKER_18]: This would include but not limited to electrical, heating, snow plowing, cleanup, maintenance, parking, staffing, et cetera.

1131
01:37:48,867 --> 01:37:56,011
[SPEAKER_18]: Seven, there should be sufficient insurance coverage borne by the vendor, contractor if you will, to cover any damage or liability.

1132
01:37:56,751 --> 01:37:58,372
[SPEAKER_18]: The city must be held harmless.

1133
01:37:59,243 --> 01:38:02,665
[SPEAKER_18]: All employees of the contractor work on site must be Corey checked.

1134
01:38:03,325 --> 01:38:09,609
[SPEAKER_18]: Appropriate security coverage will be provided by the vendor contractor during the contractor's hours of operation.

1135
01:38:11,770 --> 01:38:14,711
[SPEAKER_18]: Access to the main school building should be limited to emergencies.

1136
01:38:16,392 --> 01:38:24,396
[SPEAKER_18]: Nine promotion and advertising of the facility's purpose and use must be reviewed by the city to ensure that there is no misrepresentations. 10,

1137
01:38:26,098 --> 01:38:35,503
[SPEAKER_18]: There must be monthly reporting of activity and facility conditions to the city to ensure that any emergent situations are dealt with in a timely and effective manner.

1138
01:38:35,523 --> 01:38:43,908
[SPEAKER_18]: 11, the initial contract would be for a term of seven years with the possibility of three year extension after five years of successful performance.

1139
01:38:43,928 --> 01:38:49,551
[SPEAKER_18]: So that means after the fifth year, the committee would then decide whether it wanted to extend the three years.

1140
01:38:50,432 --> 01:38:53,233
[SPEAKER_18]: There must be an out cause in the contract for the city.

1141
01:38:53,273 --> 01:38:54,514
[SPEAKER_18]: If there was a failure to perform,

1142
01:38:55,268 --> 01:38:57,890
[SPEAKER_18]: or there is a transfer of ownership control.

1143
01:38:58,730 --> 01:39:07,956
[SPEAKER_18]: Twelve, substantial non-rental time must be available to the Medford Athletic, Physical Education and Community Schools for educational and recreational programs and activities.

1144
01:39:08,636 --> 01:39:14,220
[SPEAKER_18]: Any subcontractor of the contractor to a third party must be approved in advance by the city of Medford.

1145
01:39:15,060 --> 01:39:16,601
[SPEAKER_18]: So those are the general provisions.

1146
01:39:17,702 --> 01:39:22,005
[SPEAKER_18]: If there's something that we missed as coming out of our meetings, or if there's something that

1147
01:39:23,400 --> 01:39:26,224
[SPEAKER_18]: You want extended or clarified, we should talk about it now.

1148
01:39:27,105 --> 01:39:28,006
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Benedetto?

1149
01:39:28,647 --> 01:39:29,027
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1150
01:39:29,588 --> 01:39:36,997
[SPEAKER_13]: On number three, I agree that we need to put the 50% discount for any residents who are refugees.

1151
01:39:37,618 --> 01:39:41,463
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, I wanted to talk a little bit about the start time and the weekend time.

1152
01:39:49,740 --> 01:39:52,461
[SPEAKER_13]: We never really discussed that.

1153
01:40:05,259 --> 01:40:07,881
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'd like to see that

1154
01:40:30,595 --> 01:40:38,701
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, we talked about this, but it's not mentioned in here, a snacks shack slash sale of goods.

1155
01:40:38,861 --> 01:40:56,154
[SPEAKER_13]: We should either ban it in the beginning and renegotiate if that comes up, and if so, I would like to see our youth groups, like maybe the youth soccer, a non-profit youth group, be able to run that, or the high school, or the students,

1156
01:40:57,535 --> 01:41:01,540
[SPEAKER_13]: extracurricular activities are that way, whatever.

1157
01:41:01,701 --> 01:41:09,370
[SPEAKER_13]: That needs to be a separate discussion and maybe not allowed at this point, so that way they're clear that's not allowed, they can't just set that up.

1158
01:41:09,831 --> 01:41:15,058
[SPEAKER_13]: And if they want to, they need to revisit us and that would be a separate contract.

1159
01:41:15,907 --> 01:41:18,049
[SPEAKER_13]: OK, because that would be a lot involved.

1160
01:41:18,229 --> 01:41:26,857
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, I think number 12, the substantial non-rental time must be available to math and athletic and physical education and community schools.

1161
01:41:28,467 --> 01:41:31,329
[SPEAKER_13]: for educational and recreational program and activities.

1162
01:41:31,689 --> 01:41:34,071
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we need to be much more specific there.

1163
01:41:34,491 --> 01:41:43,978
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's just too general and I think we have to be very clear what we want and what we expect so we get what we want and we're not surprised that we don't have everything we need.

1164
01:41:44,478 --> 01:41:50,002
[SPEAKER_13]: So those are my notes and my things and I'd like to talk more about that.

1165
01:41:50,022 --> 01:41:55,806
[SPEAKER_11]: It also does not include the minimum rental fee

1166
01:41:59,965 --> 01:42:01,586
[SPEAKER_15]: late November to March.

1167
01:42:04,247 --> 01:42:04,887
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Skerry.

1168
01:42:04,907 --> 01:42:06,407
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, ma'am.

1169
01:42:06,488 --> 01:42:08,108
[SPEAKER_05]: You and I share the same concerns.

1170
01:42:08,528 --> 01:42:11,850
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm surprised to see that there's no expected remuneration to the city.

1171
01:42:12,370 --> 01:42:26,535
[SPEAKER_05]: I had asked the previous meetings to find out just where we're at with the field of dreams as far as what it's costing us each year, what we take in, what we're expending to run the place and to make sure that our bond payments are up.

1172
01:42:27,335 --> 01:42:28,836
[SPEAKER_05]: And the last thing I would,

1173
01:42:29,249 --> 01:42:34,752
[SPEAKER_05]: expect, I would hope, that we would stick to the rules that are in place now, that no refreshments on site.

1174
01:42:35,292 --> 01:42:36,812
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we have to take care of that deck.

1175
01:42:36,833 --> 01:42:41,995
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think this company is going to replace the deck at the end of their contract before they go somewhere else.

1176
01:42:42,895 --> 01:42:47,537
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, we have to take care of that surface, and it's very, very expensive to replace.

1177
01:42:48,518 --> 01:42:57,582
[SPEAKER_05]: And I also want to make sure that it's in writing in the RFP or in writing in our records where those monies, just exactly what line item those monies are going to go to.

1178
01:42:58,157 --> 01:43:02,718
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to make sure the monies go back into that project for anything it may need in the future.

1179
01:43:03,518 --> 01:43:04,839
[SPEAKER_15]: That wouldn't be in the RFP.

1180
01:43:04,859 --> 01:43:06,619
[SPEAKER_15]: No, no, I just, I want it in our records.

1181
01:43:06,639 --> 01:43:07,779
[SPEAKER_05]: The committee would have to set that up.

1182
01:43:07,799 --> 01:43:12,921
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I want it in our records that that's what's going to happen because they just don't want it to, you know, go to never never land.

1183
01:43:13,221 --> 01:43:23,703
[SPEAKER_18]: As you remember from our discussions, that was to put it, it was to go into, I'm sure we left it off for some reason, but that was to go into the, into a fund that would only be used for either debt reduction if necessary.

1184
01:43:23,763 --> 01:43:25,143
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, but I want that expressed publicly.

1185
01:43:25,163 --> 01:43:26,864
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I want to make sure that that happens.

1186
01:43:29,376 --> 01:43:29,816
[SPEAKER_15]: Definitely.

1187
01:43:30,157 --> 01:43:30,337
[SPEAKER_19]: Ms.

1188
01:43:30,357 --> 01:43:31,698
[SPEAKER_19]: Van der Kloot.

1189
01:43:32,299 --> 01:43:38,344
[SPEAKER_19]: I am concerned about number eight, access to the main school building should be limited to emergencies.

1190
01:43:38,985 --> 01:43:44,470
[SPEAKER_19]: That assumes that someone's going to have a key or to the main school building.

1191
01:43:45,791 --> 01:43:55,440
[SPEAKER_18]: So, so they're excluded from there, but if there was a, you know, situation where an ambulance had to come up for some reason and they needed access to a medical

1192
01:43:55,960 --> 01:43:56,821
[SPEAKER_18]: attention immediately.

1193
01:43:56,861 --> 01:43:58,802
[SPEAKER_18]: We have custodians on duty through 11 o'clock.

1194
01:43:58,842 --> 01:44:00,843
[SPEAKER_18]: So I mean, so they could enter the building.

1195
01:44:00,864 --> 01:44:03,405
[SPEAKER_18]: It would be obviously a call to the building and the building would open.

1196
01:44:03,425 --> 01:44:11,951
[SPEAKER_18]: I think for that reason, I don't know, somehow it wouldn't have a key, but I mean, but if you had an emergency there and you needed the building and you didn't open it up, I think we'd be liable.

1197
01:44:13,092 --> 01:44:19,357
[SPEAKER_18]: I think you've got to be conscious of the fact that the building has to have some kind of availability for an emergency emergency.

1198
01:44:19,397 --> 01:44:20,978
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not talking about for general reasons.

1199
01:44:21,818 --> 01:44:22,519
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, we just,

1200
01:44:22,890 --> 01:44:27,871
[SPEAKER_19]: But doesn't that put a responsibility on us to always have someone in the high school who can open it up?

1201
01:44:27,971 --> 01:44:37,893
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, I think it's clearer if there is no access to the school facility.

1202
01:44:38,073 --> 01:44:39,693
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a decision you can make.

1203
01:44:39,993 --> 01:44:40,993
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a decision you can make.

1204
01:44:41,674 --> 01:44:49,555
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, to me, it's clearer because if we put in except limited to emergencies, it seems that it puts on to us a responsibility.

1205
01:44:51,240 --> 01:45:02,969
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think the responsibility has to be with the people who are operating the facility to use our emergency in the city.

1206
01:45:03,550 --> 01:45:12,077
[SPEAKER_19]: Also, you did not include, we talked about provisions for snow days.

1207
01:45:14,859 --> 01:45:18,001
[SPEAKER_19]: Because my concern was that all of a sudden there'll be pressure

1208
01:45:18,978 --> 01:45:27,982
[SPEAKER_19]: for us to do snow removal when our snow plows are busy.

1209
01:45:28,042 --> 01:45:30,503
[SPEAKER_19]: So I've written this way.

1210
01:45:31,464 --> 01:45:39,007
[SPEAKER_19]: The facility will be closed during snow days unless the vendor arranges snow removal acceptable to the school department.

1211
01:45:39,547 --> 01:45:40,107
[SPEAKER_18]: OK.

1212
01:45:40,188 --> 01:45:45,730
[SPEAKER_18]: So the only thing I would suggest is that we have a snow day at 7 o'clock in the morning.

1213
01:45:47,214 --> 01:45:52,261
[SPEAKER_18]: By the time the vendor gets there at 4 or 5 o'clock in the afternoon, everything's clear, everything is taken care of.

1214
01:45:52,341 --> 01:45:55,986
[SPEAKER_19]: But it's not always clear, because sometimes it takes us two or three or four days.

1215
01:45:56,006 --> 01:45:58,789
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I'm just saying, but let's say that situation would occur.

1216
01:45:58,849 --> 01:46:03,375
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't think it should be so absolute, because if we had six, seven, eight days, that's revenue that

1217
01:46:04,422 --> 01:46:07,343
[SPEAKER_18]: a vendor might be interested in, because obviously they're offsetting costs.

1218
01:46:07,403 --> 01:46:09,264
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm just doing it to be balanced.

1219
01:46:09,384 --> 01:46:09,985
[SPEAKER_19]: We could replace.

1220
01:46:10,025 --> 01:46:12,126
[SPEAKER_19]: The facility may be closed during snow days.

1221
01:46:12,646 --> 01:46:17,448
[SPEAKER_19]: But also what I'm saying is, hey, if you want it open, then you pay for the snow removal.

1222
01:46:17,928 --> 01:46:21,450
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, well, you see there's a cost of snow removal here that's put in.

1223
01:46:21,630 --> 01:46:23,311
[SPEAKER_15]: She means on school cancellation days.

1224
01:46:23,551 --> 01:46:25,012
[SPEAKER_19]: On school cancellation days.

1225
01:46:25,072 --> 01:46:27,413
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, we talked about it last weekend, I think.

1226
01:46:27,893 --> 01:46:30,694
[SPEAKER_19]: So the facility may be closed during snow emergencies.

1227
01:46:32,746 --> 01:46:38,507
[SPEAKER_19]: unless the vendor arranges snow removal acceptable to the Medford School Department.

1228
01:46:39,348 --> 01:46:39,768
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1229
01:46:40,568 --> 01:46:40,728
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

1230
01:46:40,748 --> 01:46:41,108
[SPEAKER_06]: Cuno.

1231
01:46:41,788 --> 01:46:54,652
[SPEAKER_06]: On number seven, it says appropriate security coverage will be provided by vendor contractor during the contractor's hours of operation, but we had discussed that we wanted to make sure that there was security up there at all times, not just during the hours of operation.

1232
01:46:55,612 --> 01:47:00,153
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, you know, I don't think you can ask a vendor, what do you call it, to provide security for

1233
01:47:00,972 --> 01:47:03,654
[SPEAKER_18]: for times when they're not doing their work.

1234
01:47:04,174 --> 01:47:08,958
[SPEAKER_18]: If you load up costs to the vendor, you're not going to get a vendor.

1235
01:47:09,198 --> 01:47:15,263
[SPEAKER_18]: So it has to be somewhat balanced, because obviously people want to pay for what they're responsible for.

1236
01:47:15,283 --> 01:47:21,888
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't think you can ask them to pay for things that occur at times when they're not there.

1237
01:47:21,928 --> 01:47:24,890
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, that's a decision you can make, but I think it might compromise a bit.

1238
01:47:28,943 --> 01:47:31,303
[SPEAKER_18]: subtract from other things that the vendor might be willing to do.

1239
01:47:31,884 --> 01:47:36,224
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we had spoken about making sure that there was no one up there during the off hours too.

1240
01:47:36,905 --> 01:47:41,766
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I mean, unless we were going to take that under consideration and make sure that it was going to be covered.

1241
01:47:43,146 --> 01:47:46,387
[SPEAKER_18]: Again, you know, we can put anything we want into the RFP.

1242
01:47:46,967 --> 01:47:53,348
[SPEAKER_18]: You just want to make sure that it's attractive enough for someone to come in and say, I'm willing to pay for this, do this, do that, you know, and the like.

1243
01:47:53,408 --> 01:47:54,208
[SPEAKER_18]: Is it necessary?

1244
01:47:54,248 --> 01:47:55,888
[SPEAKER_18]: If you feel it's necessary, then it goes in.

1245
01:47:56,249 --> 01:47:58,029
[SPEAKER_18]: If you don't feel it's necessary, then it might

1246
01:47:59,105 --> 01:48:04,027
[SPEAKER_18]: alter the willingness of someone to bid or to pay for certain things.

1247
01:48:04,327 --> 01:48:04,407
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

1248
01:48:04,427 --> 01:48:09,769
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we had discussed that, and we had also discussed making sure that we would have coverage in the high school at all times.

1249
01:48:10,349 --> 01:48:11,630
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't have access to the high school.

1250
01:48:11,650 --> 01:48:12,930
[SPEAKER_18]: No, they don't have access to the high school.

1251
01:48:13,011 --> 01:48:16,932
[SPEAKER_07]: And the other thing was, I just lost my concentration here.

1252
01:48:17,232 --> 01:48:20,714
[SPEAKER_07]: The other one was, I forgot at this point.

1253
01:48:22,174 --> 01:48:23,195
[SPEAKER_07]: I had it written down.

1254
01:48:23,235 --> 01:48:23,875
[SPEAKER_07]: I apologize.

1255
01:48:25,235 --> 01:48:26,896
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, I'm still on jet lag.

1256
01:48:27,097 --> 01:48:28,978
[SPEAKER_07]: I just, just jet lag.

1257
01:48:29,578 --> 01:48:33,161
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have a date you want to get this RFP out?

1258
01:48:33,782 --> 01:48:35,003
[SPEAKER_03]: Should we try to get this going?

1259
01:48:35,323 --> 01:48:38,265
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh yeah, we'd like to get it started tonight and worked on.

1260
01:48:38,285 --> 01:48:40,207
[SPEAKER_15]: It's up to the body.

1261
01:48:40,487 --> 01:48:41,028
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1262
01:48:42,087 --> 01:48:44,409
[SPEAKER_15]: The sooner the better, so there's time to be worked on.

1263
01:48:44,429 --> 01:48:44,809
[SPEAKER_15]: I remember.

1264
01:48:45,870 --> 01:48:45,970
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

1265
01:48:46,010 --> 01:48:47,290
[SPEAKER_06]: Cuno, follow up.

1266
01:48:47,351 --> 01:48:55,536
[SPEAKER_06]: We want to make sure, as Mr. Skerry said, that once this is over and done with, that we have the condition of the fields as we gave it to them.

1267
01:48:55,876 --> 01:48:56,817
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't have it here.

1268
01:48:58,418 --> 01:48:59,198
[SPEAKER_06]: So each season?

1269
01:49:00,679 --> 01:49:03,701
[SPEAKER_06]: To make sure that we- At the end of each season, the condition is as it was given.

1270
01:49:03,741 --> 01:49:04,182
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

1271
01:49:04,282 --> 01:49:04,422
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

1272
01:49:14,467 --> 01:49:15,248
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Benedetto.

1273
01:49:15,648 --> 01:49:16,008
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1274
01:49:16,369 --> 01:49:23,255
[SPEAKER_13]: I also want to reiterate what my colleague, Mr. Skerry, talked about.

1275
01:49:23,615 --> 01:49:26,057
[SPEAKER_13]: We do request to see the committee vote.

1276
01:49:36,783 --> 01:49:42,586
[SPEAKER_13]: more funds coming in than the payment money, what we were doing then, how maintenance is going.

1277
01:49:42,646 --> 01:49:44,367
[SPEAKER_13]: I did walk the field.

1278
01:49:44,867 --> 01:49:56,133
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't walk the middle of it because children were playing on it and it looked in pretty good shape, but I did speak with people who were very involved at the beginning and they said that the field usually lasts between 12 and 15 years.

1279
01:50:00,438 --> 01:50:01,579
[SPEAKER_11]: 8 years in.

1280
01:50:02,039 --> 01:50:10,365
[SPEAKER_11]: So, through this contract that our fields wouldn't be able to take place anyway and have this experience here.

1281
01:50:10,685 --> 01:50:17,370
[SPEAKER_11]: So, maybe it has to be some provision in here that would help us redo the term on that.

1282
01:50:18,291 --> 01:50:21,033
[SPEAKER_11]: If it becomes necessary while we're in the public.

1283
01:50:30,010 --> 01:50:35,995
[SPEAKER_11]: I would really like to see a second case in this area.

1284
01:50:36,436 --> 01:50:39,118
[SPEAKER_11]: I've asked for it in the past.

1285
01:51:04,067 --> 01:51:04,768
[SPEAKER_11]: next steps.

1286
01:51:05,329 --> 01:51:11,476
[SPEAKER_11]: I know we're going to do this quickly so that way we have an opportunity to take the edge of this soon.

1287
01:51:11,516 --> 01:51:20,207
[SPEAKER_11]: We're also in a good position here in the community because of the support that we have in our field.

1288
01:51:20,327 --> 01:51:22,950
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what makes this field eligible for this

1289
01:51:36,381 --> 01:51:45,351
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I know there's still a lot of questions.

1290
01:51:45,412 --> 01:51:53,821
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a little bit of time to review the fact of penalty fees, but I'm not sure what that is.

1291
01:51:53,941 --> 01:51:57,025
[SPEAKER_11]: But I know we'll begin tomorrow.

1292
01:52:00,613 --> 01:52:04,338
[SPEAKER_11]: I do like the idea, to be honest.

1293
01:52:46,291 --> 01:52:58,847
[SPEAKER_11]: When a private company rents, they have to provide their finances to make sure that they

1294
01:53:35,524 --> 01:53:36,285
[SPEAKER_11]: From the bitters.

1295
01:53:48,541 --> 01:54:08,675
[SPEAKER_19]: I just want to make sure, because it's very crowded at that time, the lots were fully used, and in fact, I was driving around looking for a parking space for quite a while, that in that case, and I'm certainly assuming that a Saturday morning would be a very popular time to use this facility, that that

1296
01:54:09,997 --> 01:54:25,445
[SPEAKER_19]: lot in the back that the vendor is using the 100 cars would be for the vendor's use during that period of time, and that there would be no conflict with our existing contract with the Japanese language school.

1297
01:54:26,126 --> 01:54:27,166
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, that's the whole point of it.

1298
01:54:27,206 --> 01:54:30,048
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, that's why the 100 spaces, you know, we're asked for 100.

1299
01:54:31,197 --> 01:54:42,768
[SPEAKER_18]: He probably has indicated, you know, in the preliminary thing they needed about 60, but we asked for 100 because I thought there might be some overflow or there might be some situations where other multiple events were running and we might need a few extra spaces.

1300
01:54:43,528 --> 01:54:47,012
[SPEAKER_18]: Or during the regular year when we have other events sweeping, maybe more spaces.

1301
01:54:48,213 --> 01:54:50,435
[SPEAKER_18]: We'd be the beneficiaries of a larger one.

1302
01:54:51,847 --> 01:54:54,109
[SPEAKER_15]: If I could, from the chair, are you all set?

1303
01:54:55,150 --> 01:54:56,892
[SPEAKER_19]: I just have one further question.

1304
01:54:57,072 --> 01:54:58,473
[SPEAKER_19]: Sure.

1305
01:54:58,613 --> 01:55:01,977
[SPEAKER_19]: What is the date of the meeting for us to discuss community schools?

1306
01:55:02,737 --> 01:55:03,378
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sorry?

1307
01:55:03,458 --> 01:55:04,899
[SPEAKER_19]: What is the date of the meeting?

1308
01:55:04,919 --> 01:55:07,702
[SPEAKER_19]: It's the 9th.

1309
01:55:07,762 --> 01:55:09,283
[SPEAKER_19]: May 9th, which is next?

1310
01:55:10,965 --> 01:55:11,605
[SPEAKER_19]: May 9th, OK.

1311
01:55:13,903 --> 01:55:19,848
[SPEAKER_15]: Also, we spoke about having netting for the different sports, so it's not strictly for one type of sport.

1312
01:55:19,908 --> 01:55:24,452
[SPEAKER_15]: So baseball, lacrosse, golf, and soccer netting established in the facility.

1313
01:55:25,633 --> 01:55:27,514
[SPEAKER_15]: And that we would own it at the end of the term.

1314
01:55:28,135 --> 01:55:29,356
[SPEAKER_15]: We spoke about that as well.

1315
01:55:30,337 --> 01:55:30,637
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1316
01:55:31,778 --> 01:55:31,938
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

1317
01:55:31,958 --> 01:55:32,358
[SPEAKER_03]: Mustone.

1318
01:55:33,119 --> 01:55:37,943
[SPEAKER_03]: On number 12, I'm excited about the time for MEDFED youth.

1319
01:55:38,263 --> 01:55:38,724
[SPEAKER_09]: Mm-hm.

1320
01:55:39,547 --> 01:55:51,660
[SPEAKER_03]: We had talked about it in the executive session, 230 to 4, that they would start at 4, so we would have use for high school athletes, just so the community knows why it's a benefit to us.

1321
01:55:53,362 --> 01:55:59,027
[SPEAKER_03]: And then for an RFP, so once, say we get four bidders, can you then

1322
01:56:00,148 --> 01:56:03,371
[SPEAKER_03]: working with them come up with new terms or whatever set is set?

1323
01:56:03,612 --> 01:56:07,296
[SPEAKER_15]: They'd have to meet the minimum standards and then anything above you can evaluate.

1324
01:56:07,316 --> 01:56:07,436
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1325
01:56:07,516 --> 01:56:07,816
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1326
01:56:07,876 --> 01:56:08,257
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1327
01:56:08,277 --> 01:56:11,180
[SPEAKER_15]: So we can establish evaluation criteria, Ms.

1328
01:56:11,220 --> 01:56:12,381
[SPEAKER_15]: Chief Procurement Officer.

1329
01:56:13,903 --> 01:56:21,531
[SPEAKER_15]: We can establish criteria and during the interview process you're actually weighting them based upon their financial security, their past history, et cetera.

1330
01:56:25,103 --> 01:56:29,565
[SPEAKER_15]: So from that, number 12 seems to be the item that needs more specificity.

1331
01:56:30,445 --> 01:56:34,527
[SPEAKER_15]: So we want to have for varsity athletics, 230 to four.

1332
01:56:35,047 --> 01:56:42,170
[SPEAKER_15]: During the day, we'd like the ability for the gym class, if they'd like to, at least maybe use half of it.

1333
01:56:42,570 --> 01:56:42,770
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

1334
01:56:43,330 --> 01:56:50,133
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we even talked about if the vendor rented to youth, like, so if Medford Youth Soccer wanted to rent,

1335
01:56:51,529 --> 01:56:52,490
[SPEAKER_03]: they would get a discount.

1336
01:56:52,790 --> 01:57:05,461
[SPEAKER_03]: So not the 50% off, but actual young person signing up for their soccer club, but for that's a youth soccer team to be able to rent from the vendor at a discounted cost.

1337
01:57:05,961 --> 01:57:09,825
[SPEAKER_18]: But I don't know.

1338
01:57:09,865 --> 01:57:10,245
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I mean.

1339
01:57:10,265 --> 01:57:13,027
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how specific we have to get within doing that.

1340
01:57:13,047 --> 01:57:14,609
[SPEAKER_18]: You may find that you have limitations.

1341
01:57:15,289 --> 01:57:15,590
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1342
01:57:16,410 --> 01:57:18,272
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, you can, um,

1343
01:57:19,511 --> 01:57:31,697
[SPEAKER_18]: From some of the preliminary discussions, I believe that the vendor that we did talk to to get some information was talking about 4 o'clock in the afternoon during the week.

1344
01:57:32,417 --> 01:57:38,900
[SPEAKER_18]: And then on the weekends, having a more expanded time, because obviously they would have more activity in the weekend.

1345
01:57:38,920 --> 01:57:40,181
[SPEAKER_15]: 8 AM?

1346
01:57:41,541 --> 01:57:44,323
[SPEAKER_18]: I think they wanted to come in in the morning and then run through the day.

1347
01:57:44,943 --> 01:57:47,224
[SPEAKER_18]: So that wouldn't really be available to Medford

1348
01:57:48,593 --> 01:57:51,054
[SPEAKER_18]: independent programs on Saturday and Sunday.

1349
01:57:51,854 --> 01:57:56,635
[SPEAKER_18]: So I think that's what I understand from, you know, the preliminary discussions with vendors.

1350
01:57:56,655 --> 01:58:08,037
[SPEAKER_18]: So I would say four to 11 is probably typical during the week and then probably be something like 8 AM to 11, you know, 11 PM on during the weekends.

1351
01:58:11,298 --> 01:58:12,058
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Benedetto.

1352
01:58:12,638 --> 01:58:13,398
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you so much.

1353
01:58:13,618 --> 01:58:17,559
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, I also, we also need to figure out, uh, Christmas and February break.

1354
01:58:18,013 --> 01:58:29,463
[SPEAKER_13]: Because if they stay to the 4 o'clock schedule, then we, if we add any youth camps for our students or our families, then we would be able to take them outside.

1355
01:58:30,264 --> 01:58:33,607
[SPEAKER_11]: So we want to make sure that Christmas is in every grade.

1356
01:58:33,627 --> 01:58:36,130
[SPEAKER_11]: So maintain an 11 time frame.

1357
01:59:04,690 --> 01:59:06,974
[SPEAKER_11]: That's trying to stay away from me.

1358
01:59:43,515 --> 01:59:52,105
[SPEAKER_13]: I just, sorry, I just have, I would like to know what the penalty fees were and I would like to see the wording of it before we send it to the thing.

1359
01:59:52,726 --> 01:59:54,227
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't want to hold up the process.

1360
01:59:54,348 --> 01:59:54,948
[SPEAKER_13]: I really don't.

1361
01:59:54,988 --> 01:59:56,009
[SPEAKER_11]: That's not my intent.

1362
01:59:58,715 --> 02:00:04,840
[SPEAKER_11]: there's a lot of little changes and I would like to see them in print before we send it off to an RFP.

1363
02:00:31,409 --> 02:00:35,430
[SPEAKER_08]: Otherwise, you'd have a problem with the mechanism.

1364
02:00:36,051 --> 02:00:38,131
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you would then have to remove it.

1365
02:00:39,712 --> 02:00:46,274
[SPEAKER_08]: So, what we're going to do today is give you instructions on how to remove it.

1366
02:00:54,684 --> 02:01:04,631
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Benedetto just just because I don't know would this have to go past our city Councilors as well or no school department property

1367
02:01:18,147 --> 02:01:18,427
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1368
02:01:18,487 --> 02:01:20,028
[SPEAKER_18]: We'd go by the city solicitor though.

1369
02:01:20,449 --> 02:01:27,714
[SPEAKER_15]: If we wanted to set up a sinking fund per se, we may need the city council approval, but right now we're just dealing with the RFP to start.

1370
02:01:27,894 --> 02:01:36,060
[SPEAKER_13]: The only other piece I have is, um, once, once we figure out the fees and all that, the penalty fees, I think that's extremely important.

1371
02:01:36,160 --> 02:01:40,283
[SPEAKER_13]: I really want to see a dollar amount on there and I don't want it to be a little dollar amount.

1372
02:01:40,343 --> 02:01:41,864
[SPEAKER_18]: I want it to be a little dollar amount for what?

1373
02:01:42,045 --> 02:01:45,247
[SPEAKER_13]: Penalty fees, but going over or going too early or,

1374
02:01:45,636 --> 02:01:53,460
[SPEAKER_13]: not having security or whatever rules that they may break, I want a fee attached to them for breaking any and all rules.

1375
02:01:53,860 --> 02:02:03,205
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I know with our buses, I think there's a penalty fee for certain things, and it makes them do things really well really quickly.

1376
02:02:04,328 --> 02:02:05,989
[SPEAKER_13]: So I would like to see that here.

1377
02:02:06,009 --> 02:02:08,350
[SPEAKER_15]: And I want to see... Is there a dollar amount that you're thinking about?

1378
02:02:08,850 --> 02:02:11,531
[SPEAKER_13]: $5,000 for... Just for guidance?

1379
02:02:11,551 --> 02:02:23,737
[SPEAKER_13]: $5,000 for staying late for... Well, stay there till 1 in the morning, because no one's going to be up there, and we have 20 neighbors calling us, or maybe if it's after three offenses, or $1,000.

1380
02:02:23,797 --> 02:02:27,818
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I want it to be significant enough so that they're not going to do it.

1381
02:02:28,699 --> 02:02:31,360
[SPEAKER_18]: Usually, on penalty fees,

1382
02:02:32,393 --> 02:02:35,896
[SPEAKER_18]: Usually, there's a one-time pass where someone misses something.

1383
02:02:35,916 --> 02:02:37,237
[SPEAKER_18]: Then the second time, it's one thing.

1384
02:02:37,277 --> 02:02:38,918
[SPEAKER_18]: And then the third time, it's more extensive.

1385
02:02:39,679 --> 02:02:41,921
[SPEAKER_18]: And then possibly, then you reach a breach of contract.

1386
02:02:42,801 --> 02:02:47,925
[SPEAKER_18]: But you're essentially, you don't want to dissuade people from doing this.

1387
02:02:47,965 --> 02:02:49,947
[SPEAKER_18]: If you want it, you don't want to dissuade people from doing it.

1388
02:02:49,967 --> 02:02:53,570
[SPEAKER_18]: You want to make it so difficult for a person to say, I can't take the chance.

1389
02:02:53,630 --> 02:02:56,092
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to be kicking out all kinds of things.

1390
02:02:56,172 --> 02:02:59,034
[SPEAKER_18]: On the other hand, you also want to send a message that you can't.

1391
02:03:00,555 --> 02:03:03,096
[SPEAKER_18]: You can't cavalierly break the rules because you will pay for it.

1392
02:03:03,716 --> 02:03:11,178
[SPEAKER_13]: So why don't we go $250, $500, $1,000, and then after the third offense, you can lose your contract.

1393
02:03:12,759 --> 02:03:13,939
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the motion on the floor.

1394
02:03:13,959 --> 02:03:18,661
[SPEAKER_18]: I think the other thing, too, is that there are different, you know, violations.

1395
02:03:19,161 --> 02:03:22,702
[SPEAKER_18]: Staying over, not cleaning up, not having security.

1396
02:03:22,722 --> 02:03:26,923
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to think this one through just a little bit because some things are more egregious than others.

1397
02:03:27,943 --> 02:03:28,904
[SPEAKER_18]: And, you know, it could be the

1398
02:03:30,468 --> 02:03:43,893
[SPEAKER_18]: A person, if they miss it by a half an hour on a given night, it's not the same thing as blowing it out for two hours, or not having the right cleanup, or not having the right maintenance going on, or not taking care of other things that need to be done.

1399
02:03:44,513 --> 02:03:49,215
[SPEAKER_18]: So, I mean, there's severities that you want to have some degree of flex.

1400
02:03:49,515 --> 02:03:51,616
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

1401
02:03:51,936 --> 02:03:52,316
[SPEAKER_06]: Cugno?

1402
02:03:52,576 --> 02:03:54,397
[SPEAKER_06]: Just to go on that, I mean, I agree.

1403
02:03:54,777 --> 02:03:57,038
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think we should just have a slate of

1404
02:03:57,801 --> 02:04:00,703
[SPEAKER_06]: If we're going to run a message, we need to run the proper message.

1405
02:04:01,243 --> 02:04:11,950
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think that, let's say, if there's huge damage at our turf and we have a $250 fine, it's not going to be compatible to do anything.

1406
02:04:12,330 --> 02:04:17,854
[SPEAKER_06]: I think what we need to do is have you go back, set up some type of structure.

1407
02:04:18,445 --> 02:04:21,787
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's like certain things, it's X amount of money.

1408
02:04:21,827 --> 02:04:23,969
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's another certain thing, it's X amount of money.

1409
02:04:24,489 --> 02:04:29,052
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's maybe the first time around for something minor, you have a free pass.

1410
02:04:29,793 --> 02:04:33,695
[SPEAKER_06]: Then the second time, you said you want to hit them in the pocket.

1411
02:04:34,035 --> 02:04:37,198
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, if they're adults, the first time around, it might be a pass.

1412
02:04:37,618 --> 02:04:38,779
[SPEAKER_06]: Second time around, then you hit $1,000.

1413
02:04:38,879 --> 02:04:41,240
[SPEAKER_06]: Then the third time around, it's $3,000.

1414
02:04:41,280 --> 02:04:42,521
[SPEAKER_06]: They've now had three chances.

1415
02:04:42,541 --> 02:04:43,462
[SPEAKER_06]: But $250 isn't going to do anything.

1416
02:04:47,083 --> 02:04:50,546
[SPEAKER_06]: But I also think that we have to look at the severity of what it is.

1417
02:04:51,107 --> 02:04:55,551
[SPEAKER_06]: And to sit here tonight and just go back and forth and back and forth, we're not going to get anywhere with that.

1418
02:04:55,971 --> 02:04:57,472
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's my opinion on that.

1419
02:04:57,733 --> 02:05:03,418
[SPEAKER_15]: If I could just make a suggestion that over the course of the next two weeks, people think about it.

1420
02:05:03,438 --> 02:05:07,401
[SPEAKER_15]: And when the RFP comes back, be ready with some language that we can vote on.

1421
02:05:08,542 --> 02:05:11,065
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll put some recommendations down based on calling to some people.

1422
02:05:12,602 --> 02:05:13,222
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Benedetto?

1423
02:05:13,342 --> 02:05:28,090
[SPEAKER_13]: So Mayor Burke, in that two weeks, I would like to see Mr. Skerry's request for the funds that we collect now for the fields, so that way we have a total understanding of what's currently happening before we vote on more.

1424
02:05:28,570 --> 02:05:37,334
[SPEAKER_13]: And the second thing is, we talked at the last meeting about a point person and who's going to be the person that is the point person.

1425
02:05:37,577 --> 02:05:41,880
[SPEAKER_13]: the contact for this company, the liaison for this.

1426
02:05:42,380 --> 02:05:46,623
[SPEAKER_13]: And I know that our community schools director is also our athletic director.

1427
02:05:46,763 --> 02:05:54,467
[SPEAKER_13]: And at this point, I'd like to see a recreation slash community schools director hired.

1428
02:05:54,547 --> 02:05:57,229
[SPEAKER_13]: And then that pooling person would be the person.

1429
02:05:57,549 --> 02:06:06,755
[SPEAKER_13]: But I want to make sure we have something in place and we're not just adding more to Bobby Mone's lap, because he already has so many facilities to bring.

1430
02:06:07,192 --> 02:06:14,677
[SPEAKER_13]: the field, so many things already, the new batting cages, the swimming pools.

1431
02:06:14,777 --> 02:06:19,059
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, we can go on and on and on, not to mention his role as the athletic director.

1432
02:06:19,439 --> 02:06:24,603
[SPEAKER_13]: So I really don't think that he's the appropriate person to be the point person for this situation.

1433
02:06:25,303 --> 02:06:28,025
[SPEAKER_13]: And so that has to be discussed and brought forward as well.

1434
02:06:28,225 --> 02:06:30,466
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, that's a very important piece.

1435
02:06:30,526 --> 02:06:34,108
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'd like to see what your proposal is on that in two weeks.

1436
02:06:34,188 --> 02:06:36,590
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll give you time to think about that and see

1437
02:06:37,442 --> 02:06:41,265
[SPEAKER_13]: It needs to be a significant thought.

1438
02:06:41,445 --> 02:06:41,826
[SPEAKER_19]: Very good.

1439
02:06:42,326 --> 02:06:42,566
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

1440
02:06:42,586 --> 02:06:42,746
[SPEAKER_19]: Ms.

1441
02:06:42,766 --> 02:06:43,307
[SPEAKER_19]: Vanden Heuvel.

1442
02:06:44,087 --> 02:06:59,139
[SPEAKER_19]: I was just thinking that it would be very helpful if the superintendent sent to members a draft, his next draft, rather than waiting until May 16th, because there may be edits that we need to do.

1443
02:06:59,560 --> 02:07:02,022
[SPEAKER_19]: And if we wait all the way until the 16th,

1444
02:07:03,302 --> 02:07:09,107
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm afraid that we'll be at a meeting like this where we're sort of saying, you forgot this or whatever.

1445
02:07:09,167 --> 02:07:15,112
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm not quite sure how to do it, but I think it would be advantageous to see it in between.

1446
02:07:15,572 --> 02:07:17,454
[SPEAKER_18]: So here's the sequence.

1447
02:07:17,634 --> 02:07:19,235
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, I'm listening to everything tonight.

1448
02:07:20,316 --> 02:07:26,582
[SPEAKER_18]: Sometime tomorrow or the next day, I'll draft up the materials that you're giving me now and we'll run it by you in a temporary.

1449
02:07:26,602 --> 02:07:28,103
[SPEAKER_18]: Then we'll send it over to procurement.

1450
02:07:28,898 --> 02:07:31,919
[SPEAKER_18]: you know, I mean to actually draw specifications.

1451
02:07:32,719 --> 02:07:32,999
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

1452
02:07:33,019 --> 02:07:44,161
[SPEAKER_18]: And then legal to actually look at it at some point, you know, probably early next week when they've had a chance to play it through, we could send you something in the, you know, in the, in the thing.

1453
02:07:44,561 --> 02:07:48,702
[SPEAKER_18]: The only thing is, is that remember under the open meeting law, you can't deliberate with each other.

1454
02:07:49,222 --> 02:07:53,323
[SPEAKER_18]: So you can look at it yourself and feedback, but we can't,

1455
02:07:54,517 --> 02:07:57,818
[SPEAKER_18]: We can't go back and forth as a committee because we're not in open session.

1456
02:07:57,958 --> 02:08:01,979
[SPEAKER_19]: But on the other hand, we could communicate directly with you one-on-one.

1457
02:08:02,619 --> 02:08:03,020
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sorry?

1458
02:08:03,360 --> 02:08:09,482
[SPEAKER_19]: On the other hand, we could give you feedback directly one-on-one.

1459
02:08:09,622 --> 02:08:10,382
[SPEAKER_18]: You can do that.

1460
02:08:10,522 --> 02:08:11,082
[SPEAKER_18]: You can do that.

1461
02:08:11,142 --> 02:08:18,664
[SPEAKER_18]: But if there is differences between one member and another member, I won't be able to resolve it individually until we get back in open session.

1462
02:08:19,064 --> 02:08:19,224
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.

1463
02:08:19,885 --> 02:08:20,005
[SPEAKER_18]: OK?

1464
02:08:23,855 --> 02:08:24,015
[SPEAKER_20]: Ms.

1465
02:08:24,035 --> 02:08:24,355
[SPEAKER_20]: Kurtz.

1466
02:08:24,996 --> 02:08:29,597
[SPEAKER_20]: What about a backup generator in case of a power outage?

1467
02:08:29,737 --> 02:08:31,897
[SPEAKER_20]: Would they be required to have that?

1468
02:08:32,217 --> 02:08:33,017
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

1469
02:08:33,097 --> 02:08:36,478
[SPEAKER_15]: They would have that on their own to keep it up.

1470
02:08:38,818 --> 02:08:39,198
[SPEAKER_13]: All set?

1471
02:08:41,699 --> 02:08:42,359
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Benedetto.

1472
02:08:42,619 --> 02:08:43,019
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1473
02:08:43,239 --> 02:08:43,459
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry.

1474
02:08:48,574 --> 02:08:53,314
[SPEAKER_13]: My last thing with this before we move forward is I'd really like.

1475
02:09:19,186 --> 02:09:20,178
[SPEAKER_11]: I love this video so much.

1476
02:09:55,337 --> 02:09:58,479
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want the revised one of this.

1477
02:09:58,620 --> 02:10:01,582
[SPEAKER_13]: That's all I'm requesting before it goes to the RFP.

1478
02:10:01,962 --> 02:10:10,408
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't want to send it to the RFP yet until we see this revised list and make sure everything's on here and everybody's concerns are addressed.

1479
02:10:10,769 --> 02:10:15,052
[SPEAKER_13]: And then we're not having the RFP drawn up twice or adding to it.

1480
02:10:19,187 --> 02:10:22,651
[SPEAKER_13]: Move this until the subcommittee meeting of May 9.

1481
02:10:24,354 --> 02:10:27,197
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion to move this list as amended for the RFP.

1482
02:10:45,765 --> 02:10:46,585
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

1483
02:10:46,605 --> 02:10:47,065
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

1484
02:10:47,766 --> 02:10:48,426
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

1485
02:10:48,466 --> 02:10:48,826
[SPEAKER_15]: Bless you.

1486
02:10:49,206 --> 02:10:49,966
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

1487
02:10:50,707 --> 02:10:51,547
[SPEAKER_15]: The motion passes.

1488
02:10:56,268 --> 02:10:56,849
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

1489
02:10:57,509 --> 02:10:57,589
[SPEAKER_15]: OK.

1490
02:10:57,609 --> 02:10:58,049
[SPEAKER_15]: The letter.

1491
02:10:58,129 --> 02:11:00,070
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion to revert to the regular order of business.

1492
02:11:01,630 --> 02:11:02,090
[SPEAKER_15]: The letter.

1493
02:11:02,931 --> 02:11:03,611
[SPEAKER_18]: We have the letter.

1494
02:11:08,613 --> 02:11:14,675
[SPEAKER_15]: We have a letter that was requested at an earlier meeting to our state delegation in regards to charter schools.

1495
02:11:14,875 --> 02:11:19,637
[SPEAKER_15]: There was a vote taking at a committee of the whole last week and it's now on the floor.

1496
02:11:20,477 --> 02:11:26,579
[SPEAKER_18]: So what you really need to do is we only made one edit where most was added to most charters.

1497
02:11:26,739 --> 02:11:27,540
[SPEAKER_15]: To the first bullet.

1498
02:11:28,680 --> 02:11:33,722
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's the only change and if there's no objection to that then those who want to sign it.

1499
02:11:33,973 --> 02:11:37,335
[SPEAKER_18]: before we send it out, and we'll do so in the next little while when we send it out.

1500
02:11:37,355 --> 02:11:39,636
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I believe we need a roll call on this, don't we?

1501
02:11:39,656 --> 02:11:39,856
[SPEAKER_18]: Pardon me?

1502
02:11:39,936 --> 02:11:41,597
[SPEAKER_06]: We need a roll call on this, don't we?

1503
02:11:41,617 --> 02:11:42,297
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, we should vote.

1504
02:11:42,317 --> 02:11:43,358
[SPEAKER_18]: We should roll call it.

1505
02:11:43,718 --> 02:11:48,901
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion for support of the letter to our state delegation in regards to the charter school programs.

1506
02:11:49,941 --> 02:11:52,042
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there a motion on the floor for approval by Ms.

1507
02:11:52,082 --> 02:11:52,582
[SPEAKER_15]: Cugno?

1508
02:11:52,722 --> 02:11:52,943
[SPEAKER_15]: Second.

1509
02:11:53,243 --> 02:11:53,903
[SPEAKER_15]: Seconded by Ms.

1510
02:11:53,943 --> 02:11:54,583
[SPEAKER_15]: Van der Kloot.

1511
02:11:54,984 --> 02:11:55,884
[SPEAKER_15]: Roll call vote, please.

1512
02:11:55,924 --> 02:11:56,004
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

1513
02:11:56,024 --> 02:11:57,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Cugno?

1514
02:11:57,245 --> 02:11:57,485
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1515
02:12:00,810 --> 02:12:05,993
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1516
02:12:06,774 --> 02:12:09,735
[SPEAKER_15]: Six in the affirmative, one abstaining, motion passes.

1517
02:12:10,756 --> 02:12:12,457
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you have an original for us to sign?

1518
02:12:12,477 --> 02:12:13,398
[SPEAKER_04]: I have an original.

1519
02:12:14,058 --> 02:12:14,438
[SPEAKER_15]: Very good.

1520
02:12:14,818 --> 02:12:15,619
[SPEAKER_18]: Original is April 25.

1521
02:12:22,521 --> 02:12:23,822
[SPEAKER_15]: He'd have to print it again.

1522
02:12:23,842 --> 02:12:24,983
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd have to print it again.

1523
02:12:25,003 --> 02:12:26,825
[SPEAKER_15]: This is when they drafted it.

1524
02:12:26,945 --> 02:12:28,006
[SPEAKER_18]: But I think it's, you know.

1525
02:12:28,066 --> 02:12:28,727
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's fine.

1526
02:12:29,328 --> 02:12:30,028
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it'll be fine.

1527
02:12:30,469 --> 02:12:32,070
[SPEAKER_18]: Unless you really feel, you know.

1528
02:12:33,011 --> 02:12:35,294
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion to revert to the regular order of business.

1529
02:12:35,694 --> 02:12:37,616
[SPEAKER_15]: Negotiations and legals matters.

1530
02:12:37,716 --> 02:12:41,060
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there a motion to go into executive session?

1531
02:12:43,164 --> 02:12:44,045
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Benedetto.

1532
02:12:44,425 --> 02:12:45,165
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you so much.

1533
02:12:45,205 --> 02:12:52,930
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry to stop the proceedings, but we received a few things on our desk and I'd like, um, the superintendent to explain this item.

1534
02:12:54,191 --> 02:13:00,695
[SPEAKER_18]: What that is activity that was approved by community schools a while ago and it's happens to be.

1535
02:13:00,755 --> 02:13:04,958
[SPEAKER_18]: So I wanted to make sure that you, I just got it today myself from Mr. Maloney.

1536
02:13:04,998 --> 02:13:06,459
[SPEAKER_18]: So I wanted to make sure you knew about it.

1537
02:13:06,539 --> 02:13:11,382
[SPEAKER_18]: So in case you heard about an event, uh, this is a group that's been active with us in the past.

1538
02:13:11,956 --> 02:13:15,277
[SPEAKER_13]: So is there a fee charged to this group to use our facility?

1539
02:13:15,297 --> 02:13:18,458
[SPEAKER_18]: I was told that the projected fee is $3,500.

1540
02:13:19,999 --> 02:13:21,640
[SPEAKER_18]: If they spend more time, it'll be higher.

1541
02:13:22,080 --> 02:13:23,740
[SPEAKER_18]: But that's the projected fee at this time.

1542
02:13:24,221 --> 02:13:27,442
[SPEAKER_13]: And shouldn't this have come before us for our approval for rental?

1543
02:13:27,462 --> 02:13:28,602
[SPEAKER_13]: Because this is a one-time event.

1544
02:13:28,642 --> 02:13:34,444
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, again, we still haven't reached the point of having a formal fee schedule and the like.

1545
02:13:34,464 --> 02:13:35,785
[SPEAKER_18]: So this is what was in place.

1546
02:13:36,825 --> 02:13:38,826
[SPEAKER_18]: And so we just simply have gone along with it.

1547
02:13:38,866 --> 02:13:40,547
[SPEAKER_18]: But it pays the bills.

1548
02:13:41,900 --> 02:13:52,508
[SPEAKER_18]: Like I said, when we finally arrive at what we're going to do in the future after the ninth or hopefully subsequently after the ninth, uh, these fees will be readjusted to affect, to reflect whatever decisions you make.

1549
02:13:54,150 --> 02:13:54,290
[SPEAKER_19]: Ms.

1550
02:13:54,310 --> 02:13:54,810
[SPEAKER_19]: Van der Kloot.

1551
02:13:55,050 --> 02:14:00,134
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, I note that they have not updated the change of our esteemed mayor.

1552
02:14:00,715 --> 02:14:07,480
[SPEAKER_19]: And so perhaps one, somebody should communicate with them about, sorry, it's listed as mayor McGlynn.

1553
02:14:08,733 --> 02:14:09,896
[SPEAKER_19]: They haven't updated that.

1554
02:14:10,016 --> 02:14:10,537
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll talk to them.

1555
02:14:10,898 --> 02:14:11,218
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1556
02:14:14,348 --> 02:14:15,369
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Benedetto.

1557
02:14:15,649 --> 02:14:17,770
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you so much, Mayor Burke.

1558
02:14:17,930 --> 02:14:21,651
[SPEAKER_13]: So it says free admission ticket required for the cultural event.

1559
02:14:21,992 --> 02:14:23,172
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there a charge being?

1560
02:14:23,732 --> 02:14:26,774
[SPEAKER_13]: Is this a non-profit using our facility?

1561
02:14:27,254 --> 02:14:29,375
[SPEAKER_13]: Is it a church-based program?

1562
02:14:29,935 --> 02:14:34,737
[SPEAKER_18]: I believe it's a non-profit organization, but I can't attest to that at this point in time.

1563
02:14:34,938 --> 02:14:39,440
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you know what cost is involved for people to come up into our facility?

1564
02:14:40,140 --> 02:14:41,961
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a non-profit solicitor's non-profit, I'm sorry.

1565
02:14:41,981 --> 02:14:42,361
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1566
02:14:43,652 --> 02:14:46,194
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there a cost to the community to come to this event?

1567
02:14:46,955 --> 02:14:50,318
[SPEAKER_18]: Not to the general event, to the cultural activities, I believe there's a ticket.

1568
02:14:51,079 --> 02:14:53,361
[SPEAKER_13]: And do you know what they're charging our community members?

1569
02:14:53,661 --> 02:14:53,941
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't.

1570
02:14:59,264 --> 02:15:07,750
[SPEAKER_13]: I really have an issue with this not coming before us and a fee not requested in front of us.

1571
02:15:08,330 --> 02:15:18,657
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd like to make a motion that any rentals of our facility, while we're reviewing it, come before the committee before approval.

1572
02:15:19,357 --> 02:15:26,182
[SPEAKER_18]: Madam Chair, look, we've had a major discussion about rentals and we're going to have another discussion coming up.

1573
02:15:27,408 --> 02:15:32,892
[SPEAKER_18]: This is an activity, this is a group in this community that's been here before and used our properties before.

1574
02:15:33,273 --> 02:15:40,779
[SPEAKER_18]: It would be an embarrassment for me to go to them and say something at this point in time and change the rules as we're operating right now.

1575
02:15:41,779 --> 02:15:45,703
[SPEAKER_18]: Going forward after the 9th, you can make whatever rules you decide are appropriate.

1576
02:15:46,423 --> 02:15:47,704
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that's the way it ought to be.

1577
02:15:48,145 --> 02:15:54,029
[SPEAKER_18]: And if you decide everything has to come in front of you, then you're going to have to have every piece of business come in front of you all the time.

1578
02:15:54,410 --> 02:15:54,990
[SPEAKER_18]: And we'll do that.

1579
02:15:55,772 --> 02:16:03,336
[SPEAKER_18]: But at this particular point, I'm to imply that this group, you know, was any different than any other group that we've had over the years, is really kind of out of line as far as I'm concerned.

1580
02:16:03,376 --> 02:16:07,359
[SPEAKER_18]: I reach a point where, you know, this is a group, this is a cultural group within our community.

1581
02:16:07,739 --> 02:16:09,220
[SPEAKER_18]: It's active within our community.

1582
02:16:09,560 --> 02:16:10,740
[SPEAKER_18]: We should treat them with respect.

1583
02:16:11,841 --> 02:16:12,341
[SPEAKER_13]: Mayor Burke.

1584
02:16:13,242 --> 02:16:13,482
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

1585
02:16:13,502 --> 02:16:14,102
[SPEAKER_13]: DiBenedetto.

1586
02:16:14,122 --> 02:16:16,764
[SPEAKER_13]: Through you to the superintendent.

1587
02:16:18,232 --> 02:16:24,258
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm in no way judging this group, or their traditions, or their use of our building.

1588
02:16:24,518 --> 02:16:27,241
[SPEAKER_13]: I am judging the way that it's presented to us.

1589
02:16:27,761 --> 02:16:29,062
[SPEAKER_13]: We did not know about it.

1590
02:16:29,122 --> 02:16:31,064
[SPEAKER_13]: We do not know the fee structure involved.

1591
02:16:31,265 --> 02:16:34,227
[SPEAKER_13]: All we got was this piece of paper on our desk tonight.

1592
02:16:34,748 --> 02:16:37,551
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's where I have a problem with Mr. Superintendent.

1593
02:16:40,433 --> 02:16:49,519
[SPEAKER_13]: If you're telling me that this group is paying $3,500 to rent our facility for two days, I will take you on your word for that, and I have no problem with them using it.

1594
02:16:49,779 --> 02:16:59,586
[SPEAKER_13]: But for a future reference, I would like to see a contract before we rent out these facilities and know who's using our building.

1595
02:16:59,946 --> 02:17:02,527
[SPEAKER_13]: This is an hour after the Japanese school finishes.

1596
02:17:02,628 --> 02:17:04,729
[SPEAKER_13]: There's going to be a lot of transition at that time.

1597
02:17:05,129 --> 02:17:07,151
[SPEAKER_13]: I checked to see if it wasn't the same time.

1598
02:17:07,431 --> 02:17:17,598
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to make sure the safety of everyone using the facility is as appropriate and that we're charging an equal and fair amount for the uses of our facilities.

1599
02:17:17,678 --> 02:17:19,139
[SPEAKER_13]: That is my only goal.

1600
02:17:19,560 --> 02:17:30,808
[SPEAKER_13]: So, and I agree with you, we'll wait because our meeting is very soon and we'll put structures in place for this situation, but I don't want to see this on my desk every time I come in or any time I come in.

1601
02:17:31,268 --> 02:17:32,348
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1602
02:17:32,668 --> 02:17:40,571
[SPEAKER_18]: I was giving it to you tonight because it was given to me today, so you would know about it and you wouldn't hear about it on a phone call on a weekend.

1603
02:17:42,071 --> 02:18:00,777
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, I try to keep you informed when I know something's going on, but we agreed at our meeting of the whole that we would leave things alone for the rest of this year until we came to a new conclusion about our rental rates and all the stipulations involved.

1604
02:18:01,960 --> 02:18:03,841
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's all I'm saying at this point in time.

1605
02:18:04,582 --> 02:18:05,763
[SPEAKER_18]: We're just simply moving along.

1606
02:18:05,823 --> 02:18:07,564
[SPEAKER_18]: I gave it to you tonight so you'd know about it.

1607
02:18:10,185 --> 02:18:21,753
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think that you will at the, after the ninth and after subsequent meetings, you will have an opportunity to set whatever rules you want to set in place, whatever fees you want to set in place and whatever enforcements you want to set in place.

1608
02:18:22,794 --> 02:18:24,855
[SPEAKER_18]: And that will then govern whatever happens next.

1609
02:18:24,895 --> 02:18:28,918
[SPEAKER_18]: And then anything of this type, if you want to make it all come in front of you, then all come in front of you.

1610
02:18:29,973 --> 02:18:31,794
[SPEAKER_18]: But that's the way, you know, we'll do it.

1611
02:18:31,854 --> 02:18:35,235
[SPEAKER_18]: But that was the understanding we had after the last committee of the whole.

1612
02:18:35,936 --> 02:18:36,396
[SPEAKER_13]: Mayor Burke.

1613
02:18:37,536 --> 02:18:38,297
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Benedetto.

1614
02:18:38,537 --> 02:18:43,779
[SPEAKER_13]: My understanding that we were allowing people to use the gyms and the facilities in that manner.

1615
02:18:44,079 --> 02:18:48,902
[SPEAKER_13]: It wasn't for all usage of all of our facilities to move forward in the same manner.

1616
02:18:49,262 --> 02:18:51,343
[SPEAKER_13]: So we are on a different page there.

1617
02:18:51,423 --> 02:18:52,423
[SPEAKER_13]: That is one issue.

1618
02:18:52,583 --> 02:18:53,043
[SPEAKER_13]: Wait a minute.

1619
02:18:53,104 --> 02:18:53,764
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not finished.

1620
02:18:53,824 --> 02:18:55,104
[SPEAKER_13]: I was polite while you spoke.

1621
02:18:55,725 --> 02:18:55,985
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1622
02:18:58,622 --> 02:19:03,685
[SPEAKER_13]: Secondly, like I said, I don't have a problem with this group using our facility.

1623
02:19:03,765 --> 02:19:15,391
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to make sure that we do it in an appropriate, fair fashion, and that anyone who uses it in this manner gets charged the same amount of money, and that it's equal and fair throughout the community.

1624
02:19:15,811 --> 02:19:20,734
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, I am doing my due diligence as an elected official of this community.

1625
02:19:20,814 --> 02:19:24,456
[SPEAKER_13]: It is my job to do this, and I will do it as I see fit.

1626
02:19:24,576 --> 02:19:25,896
[SPEAKER_13]: And this is how I see fit.

1627
02:19:27,697 --> 02:19:38,423
[SPEAKER_13]: When we did speak of those times, we also got a request placed on our sheet, February 29th, for the financial records of the community schools.

1628
02:19:38,463 --> 02:19:43,586
[SPEAKER_13]: And at no time did we say we would wait until the meeting of May 9th for them to be presented.

1629
02:19:43,926 --> 02:19:50,409
[SPEAKER_13]: So since February 29th, I've been asking for those items, and they're still on our list, and we haven't received them.

1630
02:19:50,729 --> 02:19:55,892
[SPEAKER_13]: So I just want to say we need to move forward with this item very quickly.

1631
02:19:56,784 --> 02:19:59,606
[SPEAKER_18]: You've received more reports than most people ever see.

1632
02:20:00,426 --> 02:20:04,389
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, and you've received financial reports on all kinds of things, but you'll get even more.

1633
02:20:04,749 --> 02:20:07,611
[SPEAKER_18]: So Pat will stop doing the budget to do this one audit.

1634
02:20:08,492 --> 02:20:08,672
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

1635
02:20:08,692 --> 02:20:09,152
[SPEAKER_06]: Cuno.

1636
02:20:09,772 --> 02:20:17,217
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to ask, as far as this organization coming in through, I'm sorry, Madam Chair.

1637
02:20:18,498 --> 02:20:21,820
[SPEAKER_06]: To the superintendent, do you know if they're going to use the Karen Theater?

1638
02:20:22,341 --> 02:20:22,981
[SPEAKER_18]: If they're going to what?

1639
02:20:23,261 --> 02:20:24,002
[SPEAKER_06]: To use the theater.

1640
02:20:25,954 --> 02:20:26,314
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know.

1641
02:20:26,334 --> 02:20:27,235
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll have to ask them.

1642
02:20:27,535 --> 02:20:33,139
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just asking if they are going to use the theater, if they could just make sure that they don't bring any drinks or any food into the theater.

1643
02:20:33,179 --> 02:20:33,959
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all I'm asking.

1644
02:20:36,981 --> 02:20:37,422
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1645
02:20:38,643 --> 02:20:44,026
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there a motion on the floor to go into executive session by Mr. Skerry, seconded by Ms.

1646
02:20:44,046 --> 02:20:47,348
[SPEAKER_15]: Van der Kloot, to discuss negotiations and other legal matters?
