[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure.

57
00:03:35,697 --> 00:03:36,997
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, President De La Ruza.

58
00:03:37,017 --> 00:03:40,678
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to ask a question after maybe this is

59
00:03:55,336 --> 00:03:57,517
[SPEAKER_11]: if anybody's here to explain this in a little more detail.

60
00:03:57,797 --> 00:03:58,098
[SPEAKER_04]: Ms.

61
00:03:58,178 --> 00:04:01,039
[SPEAKER_04]: Miller is here to explain it all to us.

62
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,600
[SPEAKER_04]: Did I read it clearly enough?

63
00:04:03,281 --> 00:04:04,041
[SPEAKER_11]: You did a great job.

64
00:04:04,281 --> 00:04:04,602
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

65
00:04:05,642 --> 00:04:11,586
[SPEAKER_11]: My specific question, I guess, is not only all the salaries, but park salaries.

66
00:04:11,646 --> 00:04:13,467
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that the Parks Department and DPW?

67
00:04:13,827 --> 00:04:14,307
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, it is.

68
00:04:16,309 --> 00:04:21,652
[SPEAKER_11]: I understand why the transfers have to take place at the end of the year, but with regards to the salaries,

69
00:04:23,243 --> 00:04:28,047
[SPEAKER_11]: How are we off in the budget by $50,000 with regards to the park salaries?

70
00:04:29,268 --> 00:04:29,889
[SPEAKER_11]: The overtime?

71
00:04:29,909 --> 00:04:32,571
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, OK, gotcha.

72
00:04:34,373 --> 00:04:38,136
[SPEAKER_11]: So is that going to the salaries account, or is it going to go to the certain line item?

73
00:04:41,218 --> 00:04:42,900
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it just goes to the salary line.

74
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,381
[SPEAKER_11]: The salary line item?

75
00:04:44,681 --> 00:04:44,882
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.

76
00:04:45,742 --> 00:04:47,464
[SPEAKER_11]: Why wouldn't it go to the overtime line item?

77
00:04:47,864 --> 00:04:49,846
[SPEAKER_08]: We could do that if you prefer.

78
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:53,471
[SPEAKER_08]: They're all combined when we read the bottom line.

79
00:04:53,991 --> 00:04:57,731
[SPEAKER_08]: The salaries are all combined, so we just use that as a shorthand.

80
00:04:58,552 --> 00:05:06,753
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if my colleagues would prefer that, but I probably would prefer that anything that has to do with overtime in these transfers be designated.

81
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:07,813
[SPEAKER_11]: As overtime?

82
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:08,674
[SPEAKER_11]: As such, yeah.

83
00:05:09,454 --> 00:05:12,474
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, so in that case, forestry salary is overtime.

84
00:05:12,614 --> 00:05:14,655
[SPEAKER_08]: Park salary is overtime.

85
00:05:18,756 --> 00:05:20,616
[SPEAKER_08]: And the police salary is also overtime.

86
00:05:21,084 --> 00:05:21,584
[SPEAKER_08]: and the police.

87
00:05:22,185 --> 00:05:22,365
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

88
00:05:25,607 --> 00:05:25,707
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

89
00:05:25,727 --> 00:05:26,808
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, we'll, we can talk about it.

90
00:05:26,888 --> 00:05:27,629
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll talk about it more.

91
00:05:27,649 --> 00:05:38,816
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure next week when we discuss the entire budget after our budget hearings, but that's one thing that I have a problem with just the under budgeted, um, overtime salaries within the certain departments.

92
00:05:38,876 --> 00:05:46,581
[SPEAKER_11]: So if I could just make that request, I think it will help us better understand for, you know, budget seasons to come.

93
00:05:47,442 --> 00:05:48,583
[SPEAKER_04]: So the request was,

94
00:05:49,113 --> 00:06:03,765
[SPEAKER_11]: to designate this transfer, not just to the salary account, but the parks, forestry, and the police line items, that it be actually put into the overtime account, transferred into the overtime account.

95
00:06:04,145 --> 00:06:16,796
[SPEAKER_02]: In the future, that these transfers be indicated when they're going to overtime payment to salaries of particular departments, that it be indicated as such that it's overtime payment

96
00:06:17,332 --> 00:06:26,077
[SPEAKER_04]: For instance, to illustrate, on the police salaries, $270,000, that's going into police overtime, if I'm correct.

97
00:06:26,157 --> 00:06:26,837
[SPEAKER_08]: That is correct.

98
00:06:26,857 --> 00:06:36,903
[SPEAKER_02]: And one could probably assume, since we had the toughest winter since the flood of NOAA, we are, had a lot of police working overtime.

99
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:38,744
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, yes, that is correct.

100
00:06:38,764 --> 00:06:41,465
[SPEAKER_11]: So you understand that, Ed?

101
00:06:41,525 --> 00:06:44,347
[SPEAKER_11]: So just, it should be just to a different line item.

102
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,956
[SPEAKER_11]: If anybody else has questions, I can.

103
00:06:53,658 --> 00:06:55,880
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll yield until I find those line items specifically.

104
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:56,580
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

105
00:06:57,961 --> 00:06:58,581
[SPEAKER_05]: Council Penta.

106
00:06:59,922 --> 00:07:03,925
[SPEAKER_05]: Louise, you have $7,300 here for executive salaries.

107
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:07,387
[SPEAKER_08]: Who are those?

108
00:07:07,407 --> 00:07:16,373
[SPEAKER_08]: Those were, that was to actually cover my salary now because I am appearing in the executive budget and the former budget director when

109
00:07:17,283 --> 00:07:23,826
[SPEAKER_08]: Shelef was entitled to certain compensation that continued to come out of that salary line.

110
00:07:25,307 --> 00:07:27,648
[SPEAKER_05]: So you mean getting paid for sick and vacation time?

111
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:29,529
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, those benefits.

112
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:33,871
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

113
00:07:34,731 --> 00:07:40,834
[SPEAKER_05]: And then let's go down here to debt service of $62,900.

114
00:07:45,743 --> 00:07:46,904
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a surplus.

115
00:07:47,444 --> 00:07:47,764
[SPEAKER_05]: Pardon me?

116
00:07:48,004 --> 00:07:49,906
[SPEAKER_08]: That is a surplus in debt service.

117
00:07:51,066 --> 00:07:55,409
[SPEAKER_05]: So, in other words, under debt service, the estimates were over?

118
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:56,870
[SPEAKER_05]: They overestimated?

119
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:58,531
[SPEAKER_08]: That is correct.

120
00:07:58,631 --> 00:08:09,058
[SPEAKER_08]: Part of the debt service is an estimate of what might be needed in the next year for short-term notes, and those came in under for this fiscal year.

121
00:08:10,559 --> 00:08:13,321
[SPEAKER_05]: And under Workman's Comp, as we heard tonight, we have a $276,000 surplus.

122
00:08:17,397 --> 00:08:17,697
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct?

123
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:18,678
[SPEAKER_08]: Correct.

124
00:08:18,938 --> 00:08:21,441
[SPEAKER_08]: And as I understand it, that's an unusually low amount.

125
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:28,086
[SPEAKER_08]: There are, have been years where additional funds have been needed for workers comp and other years where there has been a surplus.

126
00:08:28,186 --> 00:08:28,407
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

127
00:08:28,947 --> 00:08:37,495
[SPEAKER_05]: Now we just reviewed tonight's health budget and it's an increase of almost $700,000, but now group health insurance, we're transferring $102,000 from apparently last year's, uh,

128
00:08:46,539 --> 00:08:52,921
[SPEAKER_05]: What I don't understand, if this is all coming under GIC, this is a huge shift in payments here.

129
00:08:53,822 --> 00:08:56,763
[SPEAKER_05]: You're saving $102,000 in one year, and you're going to increase of $700,000.

130
00:08:56,983 --> 00:09:12,949
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyone who's on GIC needs to understand that the Patrick administration left office $192 million with Group Insurance Commission in debt because they didn't fund it for the last three years.

131
00:09:14,069 --> 00:09:15,850
[SPEAKER_05]: So cities and towns now had to pick that up.

132
00:09:16,318 --> 00:09:17,758
[SPEAKER_05]: when there were 50 cities and towns.

133
00:09:17,778 --> 00:09:19,559
[SPEAKER_05]: Now there are 60 cities and towns.

134
00:09:19,979 --> 00:09:25,121
[SPEAKER_05]: That's 10 more cities and towns than when they first started out with, or before Medford even jumped on board.

135
00:09:25,801 --> 00:09:29,402
[SPEAKER_05]: That's more members, that's more payments, and now the fees are going up.

136
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:32,583
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe the legislature bailed out the $192,000.

137
00:09:33,003 --> 00:09:44,787
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just don't understand why cities and towns such as ourselves are gonna have to pay for this increase that we were told before by going to GIC, members that are in GIC,

138
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:53,263
[SPEAKER_05]: over time would have a reduction in rate, and the city of Medford would save over the next five and a half, six years approximately $24 million in insurance claims.

139
00:09:54,043 --> 00:10:00,429
[SPEAKER_05]: I just think this is very confusing to the individual rate payer who might be an employee.

140
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:13,060
[SPEAKER_05]: But I just think it's really unfair that the Commonwealth of Massachusetts would be doing this, because all it looks like it's another way of beating around a state budget, especially that deals with cities and towns.

141
00:10:13,528 --> 00:10:17,709
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you're asking cities and towns to be involved, it's like asking the taxpayers in the city.

142
00:10:18,269 --> 00:10:22,010
[SPEAKER_05]: You have a seven and a half million dollar surplus in your water and sewer account, but we're going to raise your rates.

143
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:23,870
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a complete reverse.

144
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:31,072
[SPEAKER_05]: Here you are with 50 cities and towns hoping to get lower rates and they don't fund it and they don't fund it for the last three years.

145
00:10:31,132 --> 00:10:34,292
[SPEAKER_05]: I just think that's a public comment that I'd like to make.

146
00:10:34,972 --> 00:10:35,952
[SPEAKER_05]: You're taking $80,000 out of highway salaries.

147
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:43,391
[SPEAKER_05]: This is really a tough one to deal with.

148
00:10:43,411 --> 00:10:51,955
[SPEAKER_05]: We just got through building a $14 million building and we've been asking for more people, more personnel and more supplies, more equipment.

149
00:10:53,596 --> 00:10:56,817
[SPEAKER_05]: I just don't understand why we're, why weren't the individuals hired?

150
00:10:57,577 --> 00:11:04,801
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, this actually reflects a vacancy or a part-time vacancy in the DPW commissioner position.

151
00:11:05,101 --> 00:11:07,382
[SPEAKER_08]: We have an acting commissioner right now.

152
00:11:07,913 --> 00:11:12,637
[SPEAKER_08]: who can only be paid a certain salary under retirement benefit rules.

153
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:14,579
[SPEAKER_08]: So that is part of the $80,000.

154
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:20,645
[SPEAKER_08]: The balance of it is a small amount of overtime in the highway division.

155
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:22,206
[SPEAKER_05]: So who is that person?

156
00:11:23,367 --> 00:11:24,909
[SPEAKER_08]: The acting commissioner, Paul Geer.

157
00:11:27,151 --> 00:11:28,392
[SPEAKER_05]: This is part of his salary?

158
00:11:29,133 --> 00:11:29,953
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, it is.

159
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:33,597
[SPEAKER_05]: Which ends as of June 30th.

160
00:11:35,352 --> 00:11:37,493
[SPEAKER_05]: because this is a June 30th ending budget, correct?

161
00:11:37,534 --> 00:11:38,334
[SPEAKER_08]: That is correct.

162
00:11:38,534 --> 00:11:40,876
[SPEAKER_05]: But he is staying on until January 1st of next year.

163
00:11:41,096 --> 00:11:42,237
[SPEAKER_08]: As I understand it, that is correct.

164
00:11:42,257 --> 00:11:44,558
[SPEAKER_05]: And he will be paid once again as an acting commissioner?

165
00:11:45,139 --> 00:11:45,779
[SPEAKER_08]: That is correct.

166
00:11:45,939 --> 00:11:50,082
[SPEAKER_05]: At a rate of, I believe, 975 hours per year, because that's all I think he's allowed to work.

167
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:52,904
[SPEAKER_08]: 960 hours per year, yes.

168
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:53,845
[SPEAKER_05]: 960, whatever the number is.

169
00:11:53,865 --> 00:11:54,205
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep, yep.

170
00:11:55,026 --> 00:11:55,286
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

171
00:11:56,487 --> 00:11:58,008
[SPEAKER_05]: And engineering salaries, it's another $15,000.

172
00:11:58,908 --> 00:11:59,388
[SPEAKER_05]: Why is that?

173
00:12:00,449 --> 00:12:04,272
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the engineering aides passed away earlier this year.

174
00:12:10,143 --> 00:12:31,692
[SPEAKER_05]: Louise, you were there the night when the engineering office was, um, came down to us and, um, I'm looking at, I think our city engineer had asked her approximately 30 to $40,000 for some simple upgrades, like maybe a new telephone because they're sharing four people share one phone, a new desk and new file cabinets.

175
00:12:32,872 --> 00:12:34,573
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that would be more appropriate.

176
00:12:35,362 --> 00:12:43,408
[SPEAKER_05]: to have that being transferred over here, then the ridiculousness of saying we might have to go out and bond for that, as was said that night, that's complete insanity.

177
00:12:44,349 --> 00:12:47,711
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't think we're going to propose bonding for those items.

178
00:12:47,891 --> 00:12:50,473
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I would hope not, because that's what was mentioned that night.

179
00:12:50,613 --> 00:13:04,163
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't understand why there is no way that that $40,000, $30,000, $40,000 cannot be found and just put into the transfer account to take care of that, because I just don't understand.

180
00:13:05,112 --> 00:13:09,973
[SPEAKER_05]: You talk about snow removal over here of a $473,000 item.

181
00:13:11,314 --> 00:13:15,775
[SPEAKER_05]: How much did the state give us, and is there still a balance left in the snow account?

182
00:13:16,175 --> 00:13:16,715
[SPEAKER_08]: There is.

183
00:13:16,835 --> 00:13:28,398
[SPEAKER_08]: If I could first address, there is a surplus right now in the engineering expenses budget, and the city engineer is going to be purchasing one of the items that she had mentioned at your meeting, the AutoCAD.

184
00:13:29,089 --> 00:13:41,832
[SPEAKER_08]: through that surplus and she's getting estimates on what some of the other items might be, but we don't have a firm number on what those would be or frankly what the procurement is that we might have to follow.

185
00:13:41,872 --> 00:13:44,913
[SPEAKER_08]: We may have to go for a request for proposals on some of those items.

186
00:13:46,193 --> 00:13:48,734
[SPEAKER_08]: But the snow and ice, I have the totals here.

187
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:52,895
[SPEAKER_08]: The total expended for salaries was $695,178.

188
00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:00,531
[SPEAKER_08]: which means that we're over budget by $620,104.

189
00:14:00,611 --> 00:14:03,152
[SPEAKER_08]: On the expense for snow and ice, the total that we expended was $1,634,180.

190
00:14:03,792 --> 00:14:06,713
[SPEAKER_08]: And the overage is $1,461,229, which brings us approximately to $2,080,000.

191
00:14:24,495 --> 00:14:27,876
[SPEAKER_08]: $1,000 snow and ice deficit with some extra dollars.

192
00:14:27,936 --> 00:14:28,516
[SPEAKER_08]: I just rounded.

193
00:14:29,336 --> 00:14:40,098
[SPEAKER_05]: So are you saying that this transfer of $473,200 to the snow and ice overtime budget account makes us even or not?

194
00:14:40,118 --> 00:14:41,178
[SPEAKER_05]: Or is this still a balance?

195
00:14:41,838 --> 00:14:48,259
[SPEAKER_08]: It will reduce the total snow and ice deficit to approximately $1.6 million.

196
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:49,960
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're still behind 1.6.

197
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,100
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

198
00:14:51,658 --> 00:14:52,378
[SPEAKER_08]: That is correct.

199
00:14:52,598 --> 00:14:55,999
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you had asked about the FEMA reimbursement.

200
00:14:56,059 --> 00:14:58,420
[SPEAKER_08]: We just received a communication today from FEMA.

201
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:04,021
[SPEAKER_08]: We had had difficulty, as I had explained to the council, with the FEMA worksheets.

202
00:15:04,461 --> 00:15:05,842
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll be able to enter those.

203
00:15:06,182 --> 00:15:11,983
[SPEAKER_08]: And my anticipation is that we will receive approximately $400,000, hopefully a little bit more.

204
00:15:13,064 --> 00:15:18,025
[SPEAKER_08]: But right now, that's my anticipation, which would bring the snow and ice deficit down to approximately $1.2 million.

205
00:15:22,795 --> 00:15:27,760
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe last year they were allowed to carry over that budget deficit for one year.

206
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:28,440
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

207
00:15:28,781 --> 00:15:29,101
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

208
00:15:29,201 --> 00:15:42,814
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, if we're going to have this $1.4 million starting off this next fiscal year, I would assume that the budget is inaccurate that's being proposed to us right now because we already have a budget deficit to deal with.

209
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:55,526
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I anticipate that the mayor will probably be submitting more papers to the council as he continues to work to lower that budget deficit in the coming weeks.

210
00:15:56,566 --> 00:16:07,772
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, for years, I think all the councils in our own way have been saying that the snow and ice, the budget account, it's really not an accurate number because each and every year it just goes way over that particular number.

211
00:16:08,192 --> 00:16:09,933
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're into the position we're on right now.

212
00:16:10,173 --> 00:16:12,835
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to transfer in this particular case.

213
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:12,935
[SPEAKER_05]: So,

214
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:20,752
[SPEAKER_05]: Really, once again, if anyone were to look at that, the assumption would be that you're transferring from A to B that's going to balance it out.

215
00:16:20,792 --> 00:16:24,673
[SPEAKER_05]: But it really, this Snow and Ice overtime account does not get balanced out.

216
00:16:24,713 --> 00:16:26,493
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a reduction to the dollar amount.

217
00:16:27,134 --> 00:16:33,976
[SPEAKER_05]: So my question to you is, of all these transfers, how many of these people, how many of these transfers represent the same issue?

218
00:16:34,016 --> 00:16:36,076
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's just, it's not a complete reduction.

219
00:16:36,156 --> 00:16:37,897
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just helping to lower it.

220
00:16:38,477 --> 00:16:42,478
[SPEAKER_08]: No, for all the other items, it's a complete reduction.

221
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:43,610
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a complete reduction.

222
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:44,111
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it is.

223
00:16:44,151 --> 00:16:45,511
[SPEAKER_05]: So snow and ice is the only one?

224
00:16:45,711 --> 00:16:47,672
[SPEAKER_08]: Snow and ice is the only deficit item.

225
00:16:48,213 --> 00:16:51,874
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's the only item that the state allows us to spend a deficit.

226
00:16:52,154 --> 00:16:52,414
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

227
00:16:52,535 --> 00:16:54,896
[SPEAKER_05]: But that right now is only for one more year, which is this year.

228
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:57,497
[SPEAKER_05]: So as of next year, there is no way you can carry that over.

229
00:16:57,537 --> 00:16:58,517
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to have to maintain.

230
00:16:58,537 --> 00:17:00,498
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to have to balance that out one way or the other.

231
00:17:00,838 --> 00:17:01,679
[SPEAKER_08]: That is correct.

232
00:17:01,779 --> 00:17:02,079
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

233
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:03,660
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

234
00:17:06,241 --> 00:17:10,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Councillor Knight?

235
00:17:14,823 --> 00:17:15,524
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we have a motion?

236
00:17:17,325 --> 00:17:18,987
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion for approval by Councilor Camuso.

237
00:17:19,007 --> 00:17:20,648
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Penta on that motion.

238
00:17:21,048 --> 00:17:21,669
[SPEAKER_05]: On that motion.

239
00:17:21,869 --> 00:17:25,112
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, Louise, let's go back to the veteran services again, please.

240
00:17:25,532 --> 00:17:25,733
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

241
00:17:26,673 --> 00:17:29,736
[SPEAKER_05]: We have salaries at 25,000 and then we have services at 7,000.

242
00:17:29,896 --> 00:17:33,459
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're giving up approximately, um, $33,000.

243
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:39,845
[SPEAKER_05]: Now is the $25,000 for the secretary that was in the office?

244
00:17:42,656 --> 00:17:43,657
[SPEAKER_08]: That is correct.

245
00:17:43,697 --> 00:17:44,817
[SPEAKER_05]: But I thought they hired somebody.

246
00:17:45,517 --> 00:17:47,358
[SPEAKER_08]: They did, but there was a vacancy period.

247
00:17:48,579 --> 00:17:52,201
[SPEAKER_05]: So for how long was that vacancy there that generated this kind of money?

248
00:17:53,661 --> 00:17:55,762
[SPEAKER_08]: It was for at least six or eight months.

249
00:17:56,623 --> 00:17:57,343
[SPEAKER_05]: Six or eight weeks?

250
00:17:57,683 --> 00:17:57,943
[SPEAKER_05]: Months.

251
00:17:58,084 --> 00:17:58,464
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, months.

252
00:17:58,484 --> 00:17:58,944
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

253
00:17:59,524 --> 00:18:01,265
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, it had to have been more than six months.

254
00:18:01,645 --> 00:18:02,946
[SPEAKER_08]: It was probably closer to eight months.

255
00:18:03,086 --> 00:18:03,226
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

256
00:18:03,806 --> 00:18:09,289
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when we talk about veteran services, $7,900, that's an awful lot of money because there were a lot of veterans looking

257
00:18:09,734 --> 00:18:12,795
[SPEAKER_05]: For services, so what type of services were cut?

258
00:18:13,835 --> 00:18:15,776
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually asked the same question.

259
00:18:15,816 --> 00:18:17,296
[SPEAKER_08]: They weren't cut services.

260
00:18:17,356 --> 00:18:22,498
[SPEAKER_08]: We simply paid less for certain things, such as flowers and flags.

261
00:18:22,998 --> 00:18:25,359
[SPEAKER_08]: These were not a cut of any services.

262
00:18:27,879 --> 00:18:34,601
[SPEAKER_05]: So if they're not services, they look like they're items or veterans.

263
00:18:35,722 --> 00:18:37,242
[SPEAKER_05]: Why does it come under service account?

264
00:18:39,379 --> 00:18:41,180
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't answer that question.

265
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:41,820
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

266
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:42,901
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

267
00:18:44,982 --> 00:18:49,283
[SPEAKER_05]: And jumping up to the last one, highway and sidewalks, $75,000.

268
00:18:49,423 --> 00:18:53,185
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we are just so far behind on sidewalks right now.

269
00:18:53,685 --> 00:18:55,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Why are we taking money out of that account?

270
00:18:56,787 --> 00:19:00,568
[SPEAKER_08]: For the sidewalks, it's actually both highway and sidewalks.

271
00:19:01,109 --> 00:19:08,532
[SPEAKER_08]: So the first thing is the state has reimbursed us, or will be reimbursing us, for some of the supplies.

272
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:12,044
[SPEAKER_08]: that we normally would purchase to fill potholes.

273
00:19:12,944 --> 00:19:15,606
[SPEAKER_08]: And we didn't need to expend them out of the budget.

274
00:19:16,046 --> 00:19:24,431
[SPEAKER_08]: And our employees can only do so much work within a certain period of time, and the state required that we spend the money by June 30th.

275
00:19:24,491 --> 00:19:26,633
[SPEAKER_05]: That's $140,000, I believe.

276
00:19:26,953 --> 00:19:27,213
[SPEAKER_08]: It was $143,000.

277
00:19:27,613 --> 00:19:35,198
[SPEAKER_08]: And we have prepared a spreadsheet for the council, which the council should get shortly, that shows how

278
00:19:35,611 --> 00:19:37,773
[SPEAKER_08]: The $143,000 is being expended.

279
00:19:37,853 --> 00:19:38,714
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's part of it.

280
00:19:38,774 --> 00:19:43,978
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the other part with the sidewalks is, again, it was a bad winter.

281
00:19:44,118 --> 00:19:47,721
[SPEAKER_08]: Our sidewalk contractor is just starting to work now.

282
00:19:48,481 --> 00:19:54,967
[SPEAKER_08]: And we will not be able to expend all of those funds by June 30th, which is what the operating budget requires.

283
00:19:55,047 --> 00:20:02,733
[SPEAKER_05]: So on this particular item, if that money is not expended, is that an allowable expenditure to be carried over to the next year?

284
00:20:03,237 --> 00:20:06,178
[SPEAKER_08]: nothing in the operating budget may be carried over to the next year.

285
00:20:06,358 --> 00:20:09,799
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so this technically could revert back to the general fund, correct?

286
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:11,840
[SPEAKER_08]: It could revert back to free cash.

287
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:20,022
[SPEAKER_05]: And if it reverts back to free cash, to general fund, that $75,000 could be used for this year's budget rather than having it transferred to someone else.

288
00:20:20,963 --> 00:20:26,304
[SPEAKER_08]: It could be, but again, a large part of the transfers to the snow and ice deficit.

289
00:20:28,085 --> 00:20:28,305
[SPEAKER_08]: So,

290
00:20:29,377 --> 00:20:32,499
[SPEAKER_08]: It seemed prudent to expend those funds to the snow and ice deficit.

291
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:33,360
[SPEAKER_05]: I hear what you're saying.

292
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:56,816
[SPEAKER_05]: But when you walk around this city, as I have each and every day, and you see the streets, and you see the sidewalks, and you hear about the complaints, and you hear about people calling City Hall, and they don't get any responses back, and you see the potholes, and you see the crevices in the streets, and the islands, and everything, to have that money transferred back into snow and ice, I would rather have the mayor figure out where to get the money for snow and ice, because this is an immediate problem that needs to be addressed.

293
00:20:58,656 --> 00:21:03,079
[SPEAKER_05]: between front ends and rear ends and people falling down and hurting their ankles.

294
00:21:03,299 --> 00:21:13,627
[SPEAKER_05]: The other day I saw a lady with a wheel carriage try to negotiate a contract and then go out into the street and she got stuck with the wheel carriage in the middle of the street with the baby and the guy across the street had to come over and help her lift her up.

295
00:21:14,988 --> 00:21:15,789
[SPEAKER_05]: These are just things.

296
00:21:16,209 --> 00:21:18,571
[SPEAKER_05]: This is what's really a concern here in the city of Medford.

297
00:21:19,031 --> 00:21:22,894
[SPEAKER_05]: A, no response to these type of issues, but more importantly to have this transfer

298
00:21:23,545 --> 00:21:28,108
[SPEAKER_05]: go into a snow and ice account that's already going to be a million, $400,000 in debt.

299
00:21:28,808 --> 00:21:36,133
[SPEAKER_05]: $75,000 is just a drop in the bucket for snow and ice, but $75,000 can go a long way for sidewalks and streets and curbs.

300
00:21:37,033 --> 00:21:52,663
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to recommend, Mr. President, that this $75,000 be not transferred from the from to the choose, but it reverts back to free cash and that be put back into the highway department for sidewalks immediately.

301
00:21:54,158 --> 00:21:56,178
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a motion for approval, Councilor Pinto.

302
00:21:56,498 --> 00:21:56,778
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

303
00:22:00,039 --> 00:22:00,559
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Knight.

304
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:01,539
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

305
00:22:01,579 --> 00:22:08,600
[SPEAKER_13]: Miller, with the approval of these transfers, with the exception of the Snow and Ice account, would it balance the FY15 budget?

306
00:22:09,641 --> 00:22:10,201
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, it would.

307
00:22:10,781 --> 00:22:11,101
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

308
00:22:16,002 --> 00:22:19,522
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion of Councilor Camuso for approval.

309
00:22:19,542 --> 00:22:20,262
[SPEAKER_11]: As amended.

310
00:22:20,742 --> 00:22:21,303
[SPEAKER_04]: No, as amended.

311
00:22:22,163 --> 00:22:22,983
[SPEAKER_04]: Was that an amendment?

312
00:22:23,183 --> 00:22:23,363
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

313
00:22:24,705 --> 00:22:27,006
[SPEAKER_04]: What was your amendment?

314
00:22:27,026 --> 00:22:28,486
[SPEAKER_08]: Herman was the salary line.

315
00:22:30,066 --> 00:22:32,047
[SPEAKER_08]: The overtime identification.

316
00:22:32,367 --> 00:22:36,008
[SPEAKER_05]: There's two amendments.

317
00:22:36,028 --> 00:22:36,008
5, 1, 0, 3.

318
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:52,292
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, with the amendment of council law in current for the overtime clarification and explanation, if I could.

319
00:22:54,060 --> 00:23:07,805
[SPEAKER_11]: know if we could just change it to, instead of transferring it to the park salary, forestry salary, police salaries, that we actually are transferring the money where it needs to go, which is the parks, forestry, police overtime line item 5130.

320
00:23:07,905 --> 00:23:13,707
[SPEAKER_02]: So it'd be clarified as an overtime item.

321
00:23:13,727 --> 00:23:15,347
[SPEAKER_05]: And your amendment, Councilor Pinto, was?

322
00:23:15,648 --> 00:23:17,268
[SPEAKER_05]: Is under highway salaries, 010-422-5250 for $75,000.

323
00:23:23,123 --> 00:23:25,604
[SPEAKER_05]: be transferred back to free cash.

324
00:23:27,444 --> 00:23:33,705
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll tell you the reason why, because I believe it has no consequential position in this budget, because Ms.

325
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:41,627
[SPEAKER_05]: Miller just indicated, even by putting $473,200, it still doesn't bring in a balance to the budget, and you're going to have a residue of $1,400,000 left to pay in the snow and ice account.

326
00:23:53,355 --> 00:23:57,618
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm taking it out of here and transferring it to free cash.

327
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,400
[SPEAKER_05]: It's as amended.

328
00:24:03,281 --> 00:24:04,021
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's amended.

329
00:24:04,241 --> 00:24:04,542
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

330
00:24:04,602 --> 00:24:05,142
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's amended.

331
00:24:05,202 --> 00:24:06,043
[SPEAKER_11]: Explain one more time.

332
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:06,683
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

333
00:24:06,743 --> 00:24:08,024
[SPEAKER_05]: This is, let me explain it again.

334
00:24:08,044 --> 00:24:09,405
[SPEAKER_05]: One more time.

335
00:24:09,845 --> 00:24:10,305
[SPEAKER_05]: One more time.

336
00:24:10,345 --> 00:24:22,092
[SPEAKER_05]: You can have a motion for approval, but I'm amending the motion for approval to just divert one of the subject matters because as Council Knight just asked the question, exclusive of the snow and ice account,

337
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:24,061
[SPEAKER_05]: does this balance out the budget?

338
00:24:24,321 --> 00:24:25,883
[SPEAKER_05]: And you said yes, correct?

339
00:24:26,263 --> 00:24:36,531
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm saying take the $75,000, which I believe is part of making this budget balance, supposedly, and instead of putting it to the balance of the budget, just add that.

340
00:24:36,611 --> 00:24:39,013
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be added to the snow and ice account, which has a balance of $1,461,000.

341
00:24:39,353 --> 00:24:43,356
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a drop.

342
00:24:43,917 --> 00:24:48,800
[SPEAKER_05]: So that 75 can go into free cash and automatically just find its way right back to the highway department.

343
00:24:49,201 --> 00:24:52,143
[SPEAKER_05]: So these sidewalks and streets and curbs and roadways

344
00:24:52,577 --> 00:24:53,678
[SPEAKER_05]: can get immediate attention.

345
00:24:55,899 --> 00:24:56,479
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Knight.

346
00:24:58,681 --> 00:24:58,841
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

347
00:24:58,881 --> 00:25:02,683
[SPEAKER_13]: Miller, if the money stays in the account, it doesn't go into free cash until it gets certified.

348
00:25:02,703 --> 00:25:04,584
[SPEAKER_13]: So that would have to happen after June 30th, correct?

349
00:25:04,945 --> 00:25:05,585
[SPEAKER_08]: That is correct.

350
00:25:05,785 --> 00:25:10,868
[SPEAKER_13]: So we'd have to wait for the funding that was surplus funding at the end of the fiscal year to be certified.

351
00:25:11,268 --> 00:25:15,291
[SPEAKER_13]: And then once that free cash is certified, then it could be used again as an expenditure.

352
00:25:15,371 --> 00:25:18,553
[SPEAKER_13]: What you're telling me is that if we transfer these funds now,

353
00:25:19,631 --> 00:25:24,272
[SPEAKER_13]: The reason that they're not being expended is because of the bad winter and the fact that a sideway contractor hasn't started yet.

354
00:25:25,452 --> 00:25:29,673
[SPEAKER_13]: So if we transfer these funds now, are these funds going to go back into a sidewalk account?

355
00:25:30,314 --> 00:25:30,834
[SPEAKER_13]: No, right?

356
00:25:30,854 --> 00:25:33,814
[SPEAKER_13]: They're going to go towards the snow and ice removal, correct?

357
00:25:33,834 --> 00:25:34,295
[SPEAKER_10]: That is correct.

358
00:25:34,615 --> 00:25:38,276
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, can you explain to me a little bit about the snow and ice removal and the way that they're budgeted?

359
00:25:38,316 --> 00:25:44,137
[SPEAKER_13]: Because it's my understanding that if you budget X amount for fiscal year 15, you can't budget less than that in fiscal year 16, correct?

360
00:25:44,877 --> 00:25:45,637
[SPEAKER_08]: That is correct.

361
00:25:45,817 --> 00:25:48,438
[SPEAKER_08]: The snow and ice budget must at least meet

362
00:25:48,909 --> 00:25:51,050
[SPEAKER_08]: the appropriation of the prior fiscal year.

363
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:54,291
[SPEAKER_08]: Otherwise the city will not be allowed to deficit spend.

364
00:25:54,912 --> 00:25:56,592
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a requirement of deficit spending.

365
00:25:56,612 --> 00:26:02,535
[SPEAKER_08]: It was $75,000 for overtime and it was, I'm calculating this quickly in my head, um, 100 and it looks like 80 or 70,000, $170,000 for expenses.

366
00:26:20,631 --> 00:26:22,612
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Marks has the floor next.

367
00:26:25,233 --> 00:26:26,074
[SPEAKER_04]: I yield, Mr. President.

368
00:26:27,955 --> 00:26:28,595
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Penta.

369
00:26:28,735 --> 00:26:41,341
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're saying that the $170,000 that's earmarked for the snow and ice, the $70,000 is for the overtime, $170,000, that has to be the minimum for the next year?

370
00:26:41,781 --> 00:26:42,422
[SPEAKER_08]: That is correct.

371
00:26:42,482 --> 00:26:43,942
[SPEAKER_05]: And this year, we just got through spending $1,600,000.

372
00:26:44,043 --> 00:26:45,023
[SPEAKER_05]: And all I'm saying is take the $75,000

373
00:26:49,457 --> 00:26:52,259
[SPEAKER_05]: throw that back into free cash, which is for this year.

374
00:26:52,379 --> 00:27:04,670
[SPEAKER_05]: And yes, it will be once it's recertified the 1st of July, you can pull that $75,000 right out right away and just add that over and beyond that for which the highway department has its budget right now for sidewalks.

375
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:09,194
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to get an additional $75,000 just because you didn't expend it now.

376
00:27:09,594 --> 00:27:11,956
[SPEAKER_05]: That doesn't mean you can't expend it after July 1st.

377
00:27:13,337 --> 00:27:16,600
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a desperate need in this community for these streets and sidewalks.

378
00:27:17,486 --> 00:27:25,372
[SPEAKER_05]: In this no way, by putting $75,000 into the budget, is this going to make a hill of beans on a $1,634,000 deficit?

379
00:27:25,472 --> 00:27:27,033
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President?

380
00:27:27,253 --> 00:27:27,994
[SPEAKER_05]: Counselor?

381
00:27:29,855 --> 00:27:32,237
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know why we're making this so hard.

382
00:27:32,897 --> 00:27:43,384
[SPEAKER_07]: Why don't we approve it as it is, and just ask the mayor to appropriate $75,000 from the free cash that we have right now, and it will be over with.

383
00:27:43,425 --> 00:27:44,605
[SPEAKER_07]: This is very basic stuff.

384
00:27:45,066 --> 00:27:45,246
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

385
00:27:48,422 --> 00:27:59,630
[SPEAKER_07]: And it accomplishes the same exact goal legally because the way it was presented, you can't do it because it's not going to be certified till the end of the fiscal year.

386
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:02,672
[SPEAKER_07]: And furthermore, that's when you can do it as of.

387
00:28:03,572 --> 00:28:10,337
[SPEAKER_07]: By the time the division of local services get back to us, it may not be certified as certified free cash until October or November.

388
00:28:10,568 --> 00:28:10,888
[SPEAKER_07]: correct?

389
00:28:11,228 --> 00:28:11,809
[SPEAKER_07]: That is correct.

390
00:28:12,149 --> 00:28:13,109
[SPEAKER_07]: This is basic stuff.

391
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:28,858
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, I would like to make a recommendation that, uh, any requests for funding to the streets and sidewalks, which are in desperate need of repair, uh, is made, uh, to the mayor, um, to come back to this council for approval of taking out of certified free cash that we currently have.

392
00:28:29,199 --> 00:28:34,081
[SPEAKER_07]: Therefore, we don't have to wait, uh, until this is, this is very simple, a mass municipal finance law.

393
00:28:34,602 --> 00:28:35,582
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to make that motion.

394
00:28:36,203 --> 00:28:37,924
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's an amendment to the main motion.

395
00:28:38,564 --> 00:28:39,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Mark.

396
00:28:39,224 --> 00:28:40,185
[SPEAKER_04]: That's no different than what I,

397
00:28:41,728 --> 00:28:42,629
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Mr. President.

398
00:28:42,789 --> 00:28:49,195
[SPEAKER_00]: And my council colleague, Councilor Penta, brings up a very valid point about the streets that need to be repaired.

399
00:28:49,255 --> 00:28:56,100
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know about my council colleagues, but I'm receiving a lot of emails and phone calls regarding potholes throughout the community.

400
00:28:56,601 --> 00:29:00,484
[SPEAKER_00]: I think our DPW has done a terrific job with the resources they have.

401
00:29:00,945 --> 00:29:09,612
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I, too, would not agree with $75,000 being moved out of the highway and sidewalk account

402
00:29:10,417 --> 00:29:15,941
[SPEAKER_00]: I realize we had a tough winter, but it is June now, and the winter's been over for many, many months now.

403
00:29:16,661 --> 00:29:26,468
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't see that as an excuse why we weren't able to expend some of this money to address some of the needs that we have with the potholes throughout the community.

404
00:29:27,409 --> 00:29:33,313
[SPEAKER_00]: The other question I have is regarding the transferring of 93,000 from streetlights.

405
00:29:34,233 --> 00:29:39,197
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at, Louise, if you have — I don't know if you have a copy of the budget in front of you,

406
00:29:39,897 --> 00:29:41,318
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriation for FY14 for streetlights was $651,700.

407
00:29:41,378 --> 00:29:42,418
[SPEAKER_00]: For FY15, it was $782,040.

408
00:29:42,458 --> 00:29:48,200
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're telling me that we have $93,000 that we're not going to expend in that account that we could transfer, which would bring that down to $689,000 for FY15.

409
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,020
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in FY16,

410
00:30:08,772 --> 00:30:11,614
[SPEAKER_00]: the administration's asking for $782,000 again.

411
00:30:12,694 --> 00:30:20,118
[SPEAKER_00]: So why would we be transferring $93,000 this year and then next year anticipate the full amount again?

412
00:30:20,578 --> 00:30:21,579
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't understand that.

413
00:30:22,119 --> 00:30:28,142
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the utilities account, so this is the actual cost of electricity for the streetlights.

414
00:30:28,502 --> 00:30:35,706
[SPEAKER_08]: So when we were putting together the projections a year ago, they were based up on a certain price for electricity.

415
00:30:35,746 --> 00:30:37,487
[SPEAKER_08]: In the meantime, we had renegotiated

416
00:30:37,775 --> 00:30:45,337
[SPEAKER_08]: the contract, and we're able to have some savings over what we had anticipated initially for our electrical costs.

417
00:30:45,377 --> 00:30:53,940
[SPEAKER_08]: We have now locked in the rate for, I think, through September of this year, and then we will be negotiating a new contract.

418
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:57,361
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's in anticipation of the negotiation of the new contract.

419
00:30:57,401 --> 00:31:01,682
[SPEAKER_08]: Electric rates have gone up, and we anticipate that they will go up in the next fiscal year.

420
00:31:02,803 --> 00:31:05,003
[SPEAKER_00]: And why are we waiting so long to lock in a rate?

421
00:31:05,744 --> 00:31:06,964
[SPEAKER_00]: You said they end September.

422
00:31:07,647 --> 00:31:07,927
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

423
00:31:08,067 --> 00:31:12,409
[SPEAKER_00]: What leverage do we have by trying to negotiate now when our contract ends in September?

424
00:31:12,909 --> 00:31:25,573
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a contractor who actually handles the bids for us through the Environment and Energy Office, and they're guiding us as to the right time to go out to bid and the number of bids to receive.

425
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:29,175
[SPEAKER_08]: So right now, I don't know where we are with that process.

426
00:31:29,315 --> 00:31:33,136
[SPEAKER_08]: I can certainly find out where we are with that process and get you an answer.

427
00:31:33,156 --> 00:31:36,137
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to me in the negotiation process, the right time went

428
00:31:36,433 --> 00:31:41,075
[SPEAKER_00]: be to go out a month before your contract's up, because then you have no leverage.

429
00:31:42,436 --> 00:31:48,699
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not sure who's advising, but it doesn't make much sense to me to wait until the last minute to enter into a contract.

430
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:51,541
[SPEAKER_08]: We can certainly find out what the reasoning is.

431
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:52,381
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

432
00:31:53,281 --> 00:32:04,207
[SPEAKER_00]: And furthermore, I mean, to keep that $93,000 or a little over $93,000 in the account, I believe is overestimating what the potential could be.

433
00:32:05,204 --> 00:32:10,047
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just another wear in the budget that we're going to see an account that has an additional 50, 100, $150,000.

434
00:32:10,847 --> 00:32:19,091
[SPEAKER_00]: And this council has mentioned on many occasions that we want to see a realistic budget.

435
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:28,355
[SPEAKER_00]: And I realize everything's not etched in stone, but this seems to me a lot of wiggle room when you start going through the budget in different accounts.

436
00:32:28,816 --> 00:32:33,718
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I requested that we see a copy of the up-to-date expenditure

437
00:32:34,242 --> 00:32:44,246
[SPEAKER_00]: after each of these line items, which helps me draw a picture of whether or not these accounts are being settled or whether or not we're transferring out of each account.

438
00:32:45,027 --> 00:32:48,928
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've yet to receive that, but we've asked that last year.

439
00:32:48,948 --> 00:32:52,390
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you weren't budget director last year, but this year we asked again.

440
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:59,633
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I would just agree with my council colleague, Councilor Penter, with the needs that we have on our streets currently.

441
00:32:59,653 --> 00:33:04,055
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I drop my kids off at the high school in the morning on Winthrop Street.

442
00:33:04,514 --> 00:33:13,842
[SPEAKER_00]: There are literally gullies when you take the right up to go up to the high school, that if you have a small car, your car can actually go into one of these gullies.

443
00:33:13,862 --> 00:33:15,083
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how deep it is.

444
00:33:16,564 --> 00:33:19,486
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is troubling in that particular area.

445
00:33:19,506 --> 00:33:22,188
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's throughout the entire city.

446
00:33:22,829 --> 00:33:33,738
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not quite sure why this money hasn't been expended to use it what it's intended for, which would be sidewalk defects, potholes,

447
00:33:35,103 --> 00:33:37,944
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we can go based on a tough winter.

448
00:33:38,004 --> 00:33:39,625
[SPEAKER_00]: We're already several months after the winter.

449
00:33:40,045 --> 00:33:41,705
[SPEAKER_00]: The weather's been beautiful to fill potholes.

450
00:33:43,026 --> 00:33:45,067
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't agree with that.

451
00:33:45,107 --> 00:33:51,769
[SPEAKER_00]: I would support Councilor Penta's recommendation for the highway and sidewalks for the 75,000.

452
00:33:52,329 --> 00:33:56,410
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Mox.

453
00:33:56,530 --> 00:34:02,673
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have a motion of approval from Councilor Camuso as amended by Councilor Severn.

454
00:34:06,988 --> 00:34:07,288
[SPEAKER_04]: There.

455
00:34:08,608 --> 00:34:10,509
[SPEAKER_04]: So a motion to sever which?

456
00:34:11,689 --> 00:34:19,030
[SPEAKER_04]: Sever the main motion for approval, the amendment of Councilor Penta be severed.

457
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:21,831
[SPEAKER_04]: So on that motion to sever, Councilor Penta.

458
00:34:23,071 --> 00:34:23,991
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's be clear on this.

459
00:34:24,491 --> 00:34:26,812
[SPEAKER_05]: My motion is now being severed.

460
00:34:26,852 --> 00:34:34,773
[SPEAKER_05]: The $75,000 is to take it out of the transferring from this particular highway account to be used to balance a budget that also

461
00:34:35,483 --> 00:34:39,746
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really still not balanced, because the snow and ice is not up to par.

462
00:34:40,287 --> 00:34:45,931
[SPEAKER_05]: But by taking this and referring it to Free Cash, we don't have to wait for certification.

463
00:34:47,232 --> 00:34:49,394
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll go to Free Cash, and immediately, that's $75,000.

464
00:34:49,434 --> 00:34:50,595
[SPEAKER_05]: Point of information, Counselor Camuso.

465
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:56,114
[SPEAKER_07]: That's totally incorrect.

466
00:34:56,695 --> 00:34:58,436
[SPEAKER_07]: It will not go to free cash.

467
00:34:58,476 --> 00:35:08,104
[SPEAKER_07]: It will become free cash if we get to the end of this budget year and there is a positive balance in that account, and then it is certified by the Department of Revenue.

468
00:35:08,144 --> 00:35:08,644
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that correct?

469
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:09,605
[SPEAKER_07]: That is correct.

470
00:35:09,865 --> 00:35:11,006
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no other way to do it.

471
00:35:11,547 --> 00:35:12,788
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no other way to do it.

472
00:35:12,908 --> 00:35:15,210
[SPEAKER_07]: This is very basic mass municipal finance.

473
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,211
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, may I please finish?

474
00:35:17,432 --> 00:35:18,993
[SPEAKER_07]: You can finish, but tell the truth.

475
00:35:19,565 --> 00:35:20,546
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what you're talking about.

476
00:35:20,906 --> 00:35:21,246
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

477
00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:22,588
[SPEAKER_04]: You've made your point of information.

478
00:35:22,628 --> 00:35:23,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Councillor Penta.

479
00:35:23,889 --> 00:35:25,870
[SPEAKER_05]: The $75,000 is very easy to understand.

480
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:28,593
[SPEAKER_05]: You just put it into the account now, and you can take it out.

481
00:35:28,693 --> 00:35:33,296
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you want to wait for the recertification to come in, the $75,000 can be recertified.

482
00:35:33,537 --> 00:35:36,099
[SPEAKER_05]: But at least it's there right now, and it can be expended right now.

483
00:35:36,619 --> 00:35:40,162
[SPEAKER_05]: This $75,000 becomes part of the free cash.

484
00:35:40,202 --> 00:35:40,583
[SPEAKER_05]: What do we have?

485
00:35:40,603 --> 00:35:43,085
[SPEAKER_05]: $6.5 million or thereabouts in free cash?

486
00:35:43,885 --> 00:35:44,846
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe that is correct.

487
00:35:44,946 --> 00:35:45,287
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

488
00:35:45,307 --> 00:35:48,229
[SPEAKER_05]: With $6.5 million in free cash, I'm not about to take

489
00:35:49,115 --> 00:35:57,179
[SPEAKER_05]: $75,000 to try to balance a budget that should have been balanced properly and worry about $75,000 that should be going to sidewalks.

490
00:35:57,439 --> 00:36:08,265
[SPEAKER_05]: So you take the $75,000, you transfer it back to the at-present free cash account, and you're just right to check out now, so to speak, and start it right back into the highway department and add to their budget by $75,000.

491
00:36:08,485 --> 00:36:12,907
[SPEAKER_05]: The point of clarification, Madam Vice President.

492
00:36:13,247 --> 00:36:14,868
[SPEAKER_11]: Another way then, thank you.

493
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:26,176
[SPEAKER_11]: President De La Russo, another way to do it then is to leave it in highways and sidewalks and ask them to expend it to fill potholes and work on our streets rather than even dealing with certified free cash.

494
00:36:26,336 --> 00:36:27,917
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was Councilor Camuso's motion.

495
00:36:28,037 --> 00:36:29,137
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I asked to do.

496
00:36:29,818 --> 00:36:36,261
[SPEAKER_07]: And if we needed additional money to pull it out of certified free cash, what the council is asking to do cannot be done.

497
00:36:36,881 --> 00:36:37,602
[SPEAKER_07]: It cannot be done.

498
00:36:38,622 --> 00:36:41,464
[SPEAKER_07]: And the louder we get isn't going to make it to be able to be done.

499
00:36:42,064 --> 00:36:42,644
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not the case.

500
00:36:43,085 --> 00:36:43,665
[SPEAKER_07]: It can't be done.

501
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:49,193
[SPEAKER_07]: The budget director right here, that's an attorney, just explained to us that it can't be done the way he's presenting it.

502
00:36:49,433 --> 00:36:50,974
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm not here to be confrontational.

503
00:36:51,595 --> 00:36:53,036
[SPEAKER_07]: I just, I want to do it the right way.

504
00:36:53,716 --> 00:36:56,498
[SPEAKER_05]: To be perfectly clear, tell me if I'm right or wrong, all right, Louise?

505
00:36:56,898 --> 00:36:57,138
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

506
00:36:57,518 --> 00:37:01,441
[SPEAKER_05]: If this money, whatever this money is, goes into the free cash account right now.

507
00:37:01,701 --> 00:37:02,242
[SPEAKER_05]: It can't!

508
00:37:05,023 --> 00:37:05,343
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever.

509
00:37:05,964 --> 00:37:07,385
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't want to be the mayor?

510
00:37:07,405 --> 00:37:08,966
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on, come on.

511
00:37:10,241 --> 00:37:11,082
[SPEAKER_07]: It's frustrating.

512
00:37:11,102 --> 00:37:23,172
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very frustrating if this money gets transferred into the free cash account rather than to balance the budget now We could take any one of these forget this one We could take any one of these items and make the request to have it transferred into free cash, correct?

513
00:37:24,273 --> 00:37:27,395
[SPEAKER_08]: We can't take these items and transfer them to free cash today.

514
00:37:27,435 --> 00:37:35,021
[SPEAKER_08]: What we do is we let the year the fiscal year close out We then have a positive balance.

515
00:37:35,041 --> 00:37:37,023
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a surplus that surplus gets a

516
00:37:37,925 --> 00:37:41,769
[SPEAKER_08]: certified by DOR as free cash.

517
00:37:41,849 --> 00:37:51,798
[SPEAKER_05]: And whatever these dollars amounts might be, if in fact we have right now for free cash, we can write a check right now from our free cash account, correct?

518
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:53,180
[SPEAKER_08]: That is correct.

519
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:53,500
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

520
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:55,761
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what I said in the right... No, you didn't say it.

521
00:37:56,001 --> 00:37:56,561
[SPEAKER_07]: You didn't say it.

522
00:37:56,641 --> 00:37:57,261
[SPEAKER_05]: I just did.

523
00:37:57,521 --> 00:37:57,921
[SPEAKER_05]: You didn't listen.

524
00:37:57,941 --> 00:37:58,241
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you didn't.

525
00:37:58,541 --> 00:37:58,961
[SPEAKER_07]: You didn't.

526
00:37:59,201 --> 00:37:59,921
[SPEAKER_07]: You didn't, Robert.

527
00:37:59,961 --> 00:38:01,182
[SPEAKER_07]: Watch the tape.

528
00:38:01,542 --> 00:38:07,043
[SPEAKER_08]: If I may, the reason the $75,000 is here is because it is June 16th right now.

529
00:38:07,143 --> 00:38:11,444
[SPEAKER_08]: We do have contracts for road work, pothole work, sidewalk work.

530
00:38:11,904 --> 00:38:19,325
[SPEAKER_08]: Those contractors are already working with prior appropriations from the council, so it

531
00:38:19,913 --> 00:38:24,156
[SPEAKER_08]: This is an impossibility for us to spend it within the time frame that we have.

532
00:38:24,216 --> 00:38:25,517
[SPEAKER_08]: That is why that money is here.

533
00:38:25,817 --> 00:38:29,159
[SPEAKER_08]: Not because we don't want to spend it, not because there are no plans to spend it.

534
00:38:29,239 --> 00:38:31,360
[SPEAKER_08]: We have contractors out working right now.

535
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,882
[SPEAKER_08]: It simply is the time period that's an issue.

536
00:38:34,902 --> 00:38:37,624
[SPEAKER_00]: Point of information, Counselor Morris.

537
00:38:38,725 --> 00:38:43,608
[SPEAKER_00]: No one instructed the administration to leave this in the account two weeks before the fiscal year ends.

538
00:38:44,708 --> 00:38:46,409
[SPEAKER_00]: So these potholes could have been done.

539
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:48,651
[SPEAKER_00]: Private contracting could have been hired.

540
00:38:49,643 --> 00:38:50,543
[SPEAKER_00]: months and months ago.

541
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:59,587
[SPEAKER_00]: So, to sit back and say we can't possibly expend this money because of the timeframe is only a lack of leadership from the administration.

542
00:39:00,407 --> 00:39:01,527
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all it boils down to.

543
00:39:02,648 --> 00:39:05,889
[SPEAKER_00]: These potholes have existed since February and March.

544
00:39:07,490 --> 00:39:09,871
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I'm not sold on the fact.

545
00:39:10,711 --> 00:39:14,392
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a problem leaving it in an account and having it roll over.

546
00:39:15,233 --> 00:39:16,713
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no problem doing it that way.

547
00:39:16,773 --> 00:39:19,014
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we accomplish the same thing.

548
00:39:20,139 --> 00:39:23,040
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we should be making excuses why this money couldn't be expended.

549
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:26,320
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this money, believe me, could have been expended immediately.

550
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:32,882
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is 75,000 wouldn't even cover a majority of the potholes that currently exist on our streets alone.

551
00:39:33,282 --> 00:39:34,882
[SPEAKER_00]: Forget about sidewalk defects.

552
00:39:35,082 --> 00:39:37,703
[SPEAKER_00]: That wouldn't go towards anything, to be quite honest with you.

553
00:39:38,063 --> 00:39:40,563
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just looking at the calls that I'm receiving.

554
00:39:41,464 --> 00:39:43,884
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people saying, who's going to pay for my front end?

555
00:39:44,204 --> 00:39:46,285
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's going to pay for my bent rims on my car?

556
00:39:46,525 --> 00:39:47,825
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's going to pay for all the damage

557
00:39:48,147 --> 00:39:53,251
[SPEAKER_00]: that's being done just going down the streets, just taking a ride around the community.

558
00:39:53,872 --> 00:39:58,435
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, to have money in the account left over is really a shame.

559
00:39:58,475 --> 00:40:07,262
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it speaks volumes regarding the leadership in this building, or I should say the lack of leadership when it comes to addressing issues in this community.

560
00:40:07,703 --> 00:40:12,767
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems like the current administration is just sailing until January, and that's a shame.

561
00:40:14,668 --> 00:40:14,928
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

562
00:40:17,277 --> 00:40:19,038
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. President.

563
00:40:19,298 --> 00:40:20,379
[SPEAKER_01]: Councillor Marks is correct.

564
00:40:21,579 --> 00:40:26,762
[SPEAKER_01]: This money should have been spent some time ago and to wait until this last second.

565
00:40:26,782 --> 00:40:32,546
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, it's not your fault, Louise, but these problems have been here a while.

566
00:40:32,566 --> 00:40:33,987
[SPEAKER_01]: They should have been spent.

567
00:40:34,227 --> 00:40:37,689
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, just today I got a call from somebody on Commercial Street.

568
00:40:37,749 --> 00:40:40,590
[SPEAKER_01]: They drove their car into a pothole and broke their axle.

569
00:40:41,091 --> 00:40:45,113
[SPEAKER_01]: I got another person on the corner of Bedwood and Bennett Street that's had a sidewalk that's

570
00:40:45,663 --> 00:40:48,245
[SPEAKER_01]: That's been in disrepair for three years that they've been looking to get fixed.

571
00:40:49,026 --> 00:40:54,670
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm sure we could have hired more than one contractor months ago to get started spending.

572
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:57,632
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, spending money shouldn't be a problem.

573
00:40:58,613 --> 00:41:02,816
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's plenty of guys out there looking to work, especially on potholes.

574
00:41:02,876 --> 00:41:06,059
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the 75 doesn't really go that far.

575
00:41:10,722 --> 00:41:11,043
[SPEAKER_07]: That's true.

576
00:41:11,063 --> 00:41:11,503
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Camuso.

577
00:41:12,023 --> 00:41:12,964
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

578
00:41:13,044 --> 00:41:15,406
[SPEAKER_07]: And I have to agree with my colleague, Councilor Marks.

579
00:41:17,298 --> 00:41:39,470
[SPEAKER_07]: If this was being transferred for maybe other DPW accounts, it would make it a little bit more palatable, but given the condition of the roadways and everything else, now I obviously realize that this $75,000 and the other $80,000 that is in the account is going to be used to pay for police overtime and other services that were actually already given and rendered.

580
00:41:39,851 --> 00:41:45,534
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, I understand that, but just like Councilor Moxley said, given the state of the repairs in the community,

581
00:41:45,873 --> 00:41:55,563
[SPEAKER_07]: I would have liked to have seen the DPW have made it a priority to spend this money, even if it gave relief to just a couple areas of our community.

582
00:41:56,244 --> 00:41:59,607
[SPEAKER_07]: But like I said, move approval, Mr. President.

583
00:41:59,927 --> 00:42:01,249
[SPEAKER_07]: And motion to sever.

584
00:42:02,069 --> 00:42:04,152
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a motion for approval and to sever.

585
00:42:04,192 --> 00:42:04,752
[SPEAKER_04]: Counselor Knight.

586
00:42:05,513 --> 00:42:05,673
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

587
00:42:05,713 --> 00:42:08,196
[SPEAKER_13]: Miller, how many other accounts have a surplus in them at this point in time?

588
00:42:08,536 --> 00:42:09,297
[SPEAKER_13]: Is this the whole list?

589
00:42:11,322 --> 00:42:13,503
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the list as of right now.

590
00:42:13,663 --> 00:42:23,168
[SPEAKER_08]: I do anticipate that once we get all the utility bills, there may be some small surpluses in some of the other utility bills, utility accounts.

591
00:42:23,268 --> 00:42:23,769
[SPEAKER_08]: What's small?

592
00:42:23,909 --> 00:42:24,829
[SPEAKER_08]: $20,000 total, $25,000.

593
00:42:24,929 --> 00:42:26,170
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's a potential for a $20,000 to $25,000.

594
00:42:37,166 --> 00:42:48,715
[SPEAKER_13]: surplus which would be transferred to certified free cash at the end of the fiscal year provided that this $20,000 to $25,000 would be remaining funds from the payment of utility bills that haven't come in at this point in time?

595
00:42:49,376 --> 00:42:50,056
[SPEAKER_08]: That is correct.

596
00:42:50,257 --> 00:42:50,477
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

597
00:42:52,679 --> 00:42:52,999
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

598
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:54,800
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

599
00:42:54,840 --> 00:43:01,526
[SPEAKER_04]: So on the motion for approval by Councilor Camuso, Councilor Camuso also has a motion to sever.

600
00:43:04,727 --> 00:43:05,747
[SPEAKER_04]: Councillor Camuso.

601
00:43:06,768 --> 00:43:18,173
[SPEAKER_07]: If I could, the amendment that was presented to write a check for the $75,000 was just answered by the budget director that it cannot be done the way it's presented.

602
00:43:18,693 --> 00:43:26,696
[SPEAKER_07]: So if the gentleman's willing to remove that, otherwise I'm going to request a roll call vote because the question was asked and we did receive an answer.

603
00:43:29,918 --> 00:43:30,858
[SPEAKER_07]: To transfer.

604
00:43:30,898 --> 00:43:33,059
[SPEAKER_07]: Just a motion for approval on the paper.

605
00:43:36,036 --> 00:43:45,165
[SPEAKER_07]: No, my motion was to ask the mayor to come back with another paper requesting money out of certified free cash that was certified 2014 last year.

606
00:43:45,465 --> 00:43:49,869
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, I'd be.

607
00:43:50,650 --> 00:43:54,434
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, if you leave it under the account, it's not going to be certified until October and November of this year.

608
00:43:54,534 --> 00:43:54,834
[SPEAKER_11]: I would be.

609
00:43:58,457 --> 00:44:07,180
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd be willing to withdraw my motion and to leave the $75,000 in the account so it doesn't become part of this transfer.

610
00:44:08,561 --> 00:44:09,301
[SPEAKER_04]: Madam Vice President.

611
00:44:09,801 --> 00:44:10,181
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

612
00:44:12,102 --> 00:44:13,603
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, President De La Russo.

613
00:44:13,683 --> 00:44:19,985
[SPEAKER_11]: And if we can specify on that that we'd like, I mean, I think you don't necessarily need to put anything out to bid.

614
00:44:20,645 --> 00:44:24,687
[SPEAKER_11]: Our men and women of the DPW have been, you see them all over the place, Phil and

615
00:44:25,515 --> 00:44:25,895
[SPEAKER_11]: pot holes.

616
00:44:25,915 --> 00:44:29,958
[SPEAKER_11]: They can just get some more materials and, you know, work hard like they've been doing.

617
00:44:30,298 --> 00:44:36,142
[SPEAKER_11]: I think 75,000 will go a very long way to repair some of our roads and our, you know, our streets.

618
00:44:36,822 --> 00:44:37,443
[SPEAKER_11]: It's everywhere.

619
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:39,264
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, they're doing a good job, but we need more of it.

620
00:44:39,304 --> 00:44:52,112
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think the, I agree with Council Penter and Council Marks, we need to keep that 75,000 in the account and hopefully expend it within the, you know, within the summer months, even if they have to go and fill pot holes to the next couple of months, I think it needs to stay.

621
00:44:52,542 --> 00:44:52,942
[SPEAKER_04]: Very good.

622
00:44:53,002 --> 00:44:54,902
[SPEAKER_07]: So on the motion.

623
00:44:55,203 --> 00:45:04,544
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm still asking for the severance due to the fact that $75,000 is going to pay for some of the other items on here.

624
00:45:04,904 --> 00:45:08,245
[SPEAKER_07]: Police salaries, which is currently in the arrears for $270,000.

625
00:45:08,965 --> 00:45:10,706
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's there.

626
00:45:10,786 --> 00:45:19,867
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why I think the cleaner way to do it would be requesting the mayor to certify free cash to do the potholes, which he could do like this if he wanted to.

627
00:45:20,548 --> 00:45:22,068
[SPEAKER_04]: So on the main motion for approval,

628
00:45:22,805 --> 00:45:26,047
[SPEAKER_04]: amended by Councilor Lungo-Kern for the clarifications.

629
00:45:28,029 --> 00:45:36,655
[SPEAKER_04]: The issue of amendment of Councilor Penta has been withdrawn, but amended to a change to leave the money in the account.

630
00:45:36,856 --> 00:45:37,536
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion to sever.

631
00:45:37,716 --> 00:45:41,039
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we have a motion to sever from Councilor Camuso.

632
00:45:42,464 --> 00:45:42,624
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

633
00:45:42,664 --> 00:45:42,905
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

634
00:45:43,445 --> 00:45:43,666
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

635
00:45:43,826 --> 00:45:44,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

636
00:45:44,887 --> 00:45:45,107
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

637
00:45:45,708 --> 00:45:45,888
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

638
00:46:01,772 --> 00:46:05,754
[SPEAKER_03]: You're voting against the paper in essence, right?

639
00:46:05,834 --> 00:46:06,874
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a positive.

640
00:46:06,934 --> 00:46:18,919
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a positive amendment that, uh, on account 0 1 0 4 2 5 2 5 0 strike the $75,000 be stricken from the motion.

641
00:46:19,019 --> 00:46:19,259
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

642
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:21,640
[SPEAKER_01]: Counselor Caffiello.

643
00:46:23,141 --> 00:46:24,701
[SPEAKER_01]: We only have two weeks to spend the $75,000.

644
00:46:24,741 --> 00:46:25,422
[SPEAKER_01]: That's correct.

645
00:46:25,462 --> 00:46:26,222
[SPEAKER_08]: That is correct.

646
00:46:26,962 --> 00:46:28,563
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, and are we going to be able to do that?

647
00:46:29,978 --> 00:46:31,478
[SPEAKER_08]: We will not be able to expend the full $75,000.

648
00:46:31,658 --> 00:46:31,758
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

649
00:46:31,879 --> 00:46:35,279
[SPEAKER_08]: I think you can fill plot holes.

650
00:46:35,319 --> 00:46:35,740
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't.

651
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:36,900
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry?

652
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:39,120
[SPEAKER_08]: But they can spend it.

653
00:46:39,301 --> 00:46:41,221
[SPEAKER_08]: If we are buying materials.

654
00:46:41,561 --> 00:46:42,561
[SPEAKER_05]: You can buy the materials, Elise.

655
00:46:42,581 --> 00:46:45,822
[SPEAKER_08]: $75,000 of materials is a very large amount of asphalt.

656
00:46:45,842 --> 00:46:46,803
[SPEAKER_08]: Contract it out.

657
00:46:46,863 --> 00:46:47,643
[SPEAKER_08]: Contract it out.

658
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:55,281
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything over $10,000 has to bid.

659
00:46:55,421 --> 00:47:01,385
[SPEAKER_08]: It would take at least four weeks before we were able to advertise bid and get a bidder.

660
00:47:02,185 --> 00:47:08,468
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe this money from the state allowed cities and towns to make whatever the expenditures needed to be to be expended by June 30th.

661
00:47:08,568 --> 00:47:10,710
[SPEAKER_05]: All they have to do is have a contract in hand.

662
00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:13,131
[SPEAKER_08]: We do have the contract in place.

663
00:47:13,171 --> 00:47:17,073
[SPEAKER_08]: The contractor has started working on the potholes.

664
00:47:18,474 --> 00:47:22,236
[SPEAKER_08]: The bid was for the amount that the state had given us.

665
00:47:22,941 --> 00:47:25,463
[SPEAKER_08]: It was not for additional amounts.

666
00:47:25,503 --> 00:47:29,145
[SPEAKER_08]: So the city would have to go out to bid again if that were the case.

667
00:47:29,165 --> 00:47:30,506
[SPEAKER_05]: They could get another contractor.

668
00:47:30,987 --> 00:47:36,030
[SPEAKER_05]: As long as they have a contractor in hand, whether the work gets done July or August, the money is expended.

669
00:47:36,610 --> 00:47:44,416
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, I know that sounds good, but according to mass procurement law,

670
00:47:45,342 --> 00:47:49,163
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Penta wants to spend the money in July and August, and we can't.

671
00:47:49,463 --> 00:47:51,563
[SPEAKER_07]: Services have to be rendered by June 30th.

672
00:47:51,603 --> 00:47:54,324
[SPEAKER_07]: That's state procurement law, correct, Louise?

673
00:47:55,124 --> 00:47:55,804
[SPEAKER_07]: That is correct.

674
00:47:56,284 --> 00:47:57,924
[SPEAKER_07]: So July and August is not an option.

675
00:47:58,445 --> 00:48:00,765
[SPEAKER_07]: June 30th, the services need to be rendered by.

676
00:48:01,425 --> 00:48:03,786
[SPEAKER_11]: Or to purchase the materials in time, if I may, through the chair.

677
00:48:05,126 --> 00:48:05,526
[SPEAKER_07]: Very good.

678
00:48:06,046 --> 00:48:06,986
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have a motion.

679
00:48:07,626 --> 00:48:08,166
[SPEAKER_07]: To strike.

680
00:48:10,507 --> 00:48:11,067
[SPEAKER_02]: Roll call vote.

681
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:14,060
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have a motion to sever.

682
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:15,361
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to deal with first.

683
00:48:15,901 --> 00:48:20,083
[SPEAKER_04]: So on the motion to sever out Councilor Penta's measure.

684
00:48:20,663 --> 00:48:21,744
[SPEAKER_05]: To strike that section.

685
00:48:22,304 --> 00:48:23,685
[SPEAKER_04]: To strike that section.

686
00:48:25,586 --> 00:48:26,506
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor.

687
00:48:26,766 --> 00:48:29,948
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there's a couple of people that want to speak on this.

688
00:48:30,348 --> 00:48:32,229
[SPEAKER_08]: I also was seeking just a clarification.

689
00:48:32,289 --> 00:48:39,732
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you strike the $75,000 from the surplus, we then have to reduce the amount that goes into the snow and ice deficit by $75,000.

690
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:42,480
[SPEAKER_08]: Am I correct?

691
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:43,040
[SPEAKER_08]: Correct.

692
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:44,141
[SPEAKER_08]: That is what we would be doing.

693
00:48:44,321 --> 00:48:44,601
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

694
00:48:45,261 --> 00:48:49,223
[SPEAKER_05]: But you're also have a residue right now of $1,461,000.

695
00:48:49,743 --> 00:48:55,805
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if this was going to make it come even, that's one thing, but you said the mayor was going to be coming in with other papers.

696
00:48:56,325 --> 00:48:57,266
[SPEAKER_05]: I anticipate that.

697
00:48:57,506 --> 00:48:58,366
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

698
00:48:58,406 --> 00:48:58,766
[SPEAKER_05]: Possibly.

699
00:48:58,806 --> 00:49:00,167
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll wait for that anticipation.

700
00:49:01,727 --> 00:49:01,987
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

701
00:49:02,608 --> 00:49:05,889
[SPEAKER_04]: Please, if you would, please state your name and address for the record.

702
00:49:06,209 --> 00:49:07,209
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Michael Ruggiero.

703
00:49:07,269 --> 00:49:08,670
[SPEAKER_06]: I live on 18 Pembroke street.

704
00:49:08,930 --> 00:49:09,030
[SPEAKER_06]: Um,

705
00:49:09,557 --> 00:49:11,263
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't, I've been walking down a number of cities.

706
00:49:11,304 --> 00:49:12,407
[SPEAKER_06]: There isn't a single street.

707
00:49:13,567 --> 00:49:16,188
[SPEAKER_06]: resident of a single street that hasn't complained about parking.

708
00:49:16,468 --> 00:49:23,229
[SPEAKER_06]: On some of the streets, it's up to 10 to 15 people that live on that street complain about sidewalks or potholes literally right in front of their house.

709
00:49:23,930 --> 00:49:26,170
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the issue is more fundamental than this, however.

710
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:34,212
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it involves us transferring so late in the year and finding out that these funds are available when there's almost a point when there's nothing we can do about it.

711
00:49:34,812 --> 00:49:35,453
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand Ms.

712
00:49:35,673 --> 00:49:40,954
[SPEAKER_06]: Miller's position that she has two weeks basically to scrap together a bunch of contracts

713
00:49:41,554 --> 00:49:44,215
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, in addition to other responsibilities, that's very challenging.

714
00:49:44,676 --> 00:49:53,680
[SPEAKER_06]: However, in the future, if it's possible, this council should possibly hear transfer requests much earlier in the season than at the last minute that we're hearing them now.

715
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:54,401
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

716
00:49:55,021 --> 00:49:55,301
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks.

717
00:49:56,402 --> 00:49:57,042
[SPEAKER_04]: Good evening, Senator.

718
00:49:57,062 --> 00:49:58,423
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just taking the name and address for the record.

719
00:50:00,223 --> 00:50:01,224
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

720
00:50:01,264 --> 00:50:03,305
[SPEAKER_09]: Bob Cappucci, 71 Evans Street.

721
00:50:05,026 --> 00:50:08,748
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to echo the sentiments of Mr. Regeria, who just spoke.

722
00:50:10,365 --> 00:50:18,968
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a shame that we're this late in the game here, and we're being told that we have to spend this money in two weeks, and then we're being told that we can't.

723
00:50:20,228 --> 00:50:30,071
[SPEAKER_09]: I applaud Councillor Fenton's effort, because I think what he's saying is he's hearing the things that you guys are hearing.

724
00:50:30,491 --> 00:50:39,054
[SPEAKER_09]: On my street, on Evans Street, not all of the topical applications of streets and roads are the same throughout the city.

725
00:50:39,616 --> 00:50:43,138
[SPEAKER_09]: For instance, on my street, it's an older road.

726
00:50:44,258 --> 00:50:50,201
[SPEAKER_09]: And they have actually did a couple of the potholes, but there's one major one in the middle of the street.

727
00:50:51,041 --> 00:51:00,726
[SPEAKER_09]: And what's happening is there are blocks, in some cases boulders, that are loose in the kind of street that's applied there.

728
00:51:01,066 --> 00:51:06,128
[SPEAKER_09]: And I actually saw a car spin out and shoot one of these rocks, almost hit a little kid.

729
00:51:06,528 --> 00:51:08,249
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, we're talking not just a few,

730
00:51:08,702 --> 00:51:10,404
[SPEAKER_09]: We're talking hundreds of them.

731
00:51:10,724 --> 00:51:20,152
[SPEAKER_09]: Some residents on Evans Street have had to walk out onto the street and pick them up and stack them off of the road.

732
00:51:21,053 --> 00:51:34,705
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a much, much more serious circumstance or concern, I should say, than maybe, well, you probably do realize, I'm sure you're getting all sorts of emails and phone calls.

733
00:51:35,095 --> 00:51:43,897
[SPEAKER_09]: But at this stage of the game, to be last minute scrambling like this is an indication of we need new leadership.

734
00:51:44,377 --> 00:51:53,680
[SPEAKER_09]: And Mr. President, with all due respect, as the moderator of this panel, other cities and towns watch us.

735
00:51:54,100 --> 00:52:01,442
[SPEAKER_09]: When councilors are speaking and other councilors just start screaming out, would you please bang the gavel?

736
00:52:02,627 --> 00:52:04,327
[SPEAKER_09]: and call for some decorum.

737
00:52:04,387 --> 00:52:04,667
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

738
00:52:04,707 --> 00:52:06,828
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody on the subject, thank you.

739
00:52:07,608 --> 00:52:12,309
[SPEAKER_04]: So on the motion of Councilor Camuso to sever first, all those in favor?

740
00:52:12,729 --> 00:52:12,829
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

741
00:52:13,549 --> 00:52:14,409
[SPEAKER_04]: All those opposed?

742
00:52:14,730 --> 00:52:15,150
[SPEAKER_04]: Opposed.

743
00:52:16,170 --> 00:52:16,850
[SPEAKER_04]: One opposed.

744
00:52:17,530 --> 00:52:18,150
[SPEAKER_04]: Ayes have it.

745
00:52:24,192 --> 00:52:29,253
[SPEAKER_04]: So on the motion for approval by Councilor, no, on the motion to strike,

746
00:52:31,622 --> 00:52:44,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Item number 0 1 0 4 2 2 5 2 5 0 for $75,000, which would be deducted then from the, uh, uh, service of the, uh, snow removal debt.

747
00:52:45,765 --> 00:52:48,405
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, all those in favor.

748
00:52:49,445 --> 00:52:50,166
[SPEAKER_04]: I roll call vote.

749
00:52:50,806 --> 00:52:52,366
[SPEAKER_04]: Roll call vote has been requested.

750
00:52:52,406 --> 00:52:53,526
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a point of clarification.

751
00:52:53,546 --> 00:52:57,187
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, you made a declaration that that would,

752
00:52:58,525 --> 00:53:01,587
[SPEAKER_05]: apparently get to the, uh, snow and ice removal over time.

753
00:53:02,707 --> 00:53:06,830
[SPEAKER_02]: That was what was indicated to me by the acting director.

754
00:53:07,370 --> 00:53:13,033
[SPEAKER_05]: But that may not necessarily be true because the mayor may have decided to make an additional change.

755
00:53:13,113 --> 00:53:19,737
[SPEAKER_05]: So I really wouldn't want to, I wouldn't want to have that be said that that's where the deduction would come.

756
00:53:19,917 --> 00:53:22,018
[SPEAKER_05]: There were a lot of other items over here.

757
00:53:22,138 --> 00:53:23,399
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, as Ms.

758
00:53:23,439 --> 00:53:27,741
[SPEAKER_05]: Miller has just indicated earlier, the mayor intends to come in with additional papers, hopefully,

759
00:53:28,238 --> 00:53:32,220
[SPEAKER_05]: for the transfers or payouts, so to speak.

760
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:36,623
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think it should be just said, it's strictly a line item deletion period.

761
00:53:38,103 --> 00:53:43,506
[SPEAKER_08]: If I may, it needs to balance out, however, the total surplus and the total transfer.

762
00:53:43,566 --> 00:53:48,309
[SPEAKER_08]: So we can't transfer the amount into the Snow and Ice overtime if it's not in the surplus.

763
00:53:48,929 --> 00:53:50,290
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all that I was clarifying.

764
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:53,752
[SPEAKER_07]: Roll call vote on the amendment.

765
00:53:54,696 --> 00:53:57,799
[SPEAKER_04]: On the request of Councilor Camuso for a roll call vote.

766
00:53:57,839 --> 00:53:59,080
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

767
00:54:02,002 --> 00:54:02,783
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Camuso?

768
00:54:02,803 --> 00:54:03,103
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

769
00:54:04,064 --> 00:54:04,804
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Cabrera?

770
00:54:04,844 --> 00:54:05,125
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

771
00:54:06,185 --> 00:54:06,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Hancock?

772
00:54:06,826 --> 00:54:07,086
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

773
00:54:07,907 --> 00:54:08,808
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice-President Omicron?

774
00:54:08,868 --> 00:54:09,088
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

775
00:54:09,968 --> 00:54:10,509
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Martins?

776
00:54:10,769 --> 00:54:11,089
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

777
00:54:11,650 --> 00:54:12,230
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Patuk?

778
00:54:12,330 --> 00:54:12,591
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

779
00:54:13,211 --> 00:54:14,032
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice-President Dela Cruz?

780
00:54:14,112 --> 00:54:14,492
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

781
00:54:15,073 --> 00:54:18,115
[SPEAKER_04]: A vote of four in the negative, three in the affirmative.

782
00:54:18,495 --> 00:54:19,836
[SPEAKER_04]: The motion fails.

783
00:54:20,517 --> 00:54:24,100
[SPEAKER_04]: On the main motion of approval by Councilor Camuso,

784
00:54:24,718 --> 00:54:27,140
[SPEAKER_04]: as amended by Vice President Longo Kern.

785
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:28,821
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor?

786
00:54:28,841 --> 00:54:29,221
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

787
00:54:29,742 --> 00:54:29,902
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

788
00:54:30,202 --> 00:54:30,983
[SPEAKER_04]: All those opposed?

789
00:54:31,783 --> 00:54:32,504
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion carries.

790
00:54:33,565 --> 00:54:34,105
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Louise.

791
00:54:35,306 --> 00:54:35,746
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks, Louise.

792
00:54:36,507 --> 00:54:36,827
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

793
00:54:36,927 --> 00:54:54,420
[SPEAKER_04]: While we're on to suspension, Councilor Caviello has requested us to take item number 15-539, Petitions, Presidents, and Presentations on Similar Matters, a petition for common vigilance license by Antonio J. Pereira

794
00:54:54,941 --> 00:55:03,645
[SPEAKER_04]: for Tasty Gourmet at 321B, Austin Avenue, Medford, Massachusetts.

795
00:55:03,745 --> 00:55:07,627
[SPEAKER_04]: On file, all the appropriate certificates and letters of compliance.

796
00:55:08,187 --> 00:55:11,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Counselor Caviello, Chairman of the Licensing Subcommittee.

797
00:55:14,130 --> 00:55:14,910
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. President.

798
00:55:16,471 --> 00:55:21,673
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. President, I have reviewed the gentleman's paperwork, and everything seems to be in order.

799
00:55:23,774 --> 00:55:24,074
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

800
00:55:24,334 --> 00:55:24,614
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

801
00:55:24,914 --> 00:55:25,855
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you own another restaurant?

802
00:55:26,475 --> 00:55:27,255
[SPEAKER_01]: I see your face around.

803
00:55:27,755 --> 00:55:28,896
[SPEAKER_01]: Lisa's Family Pizzeria.

804
00:55:29,176 --> 00:55:30,216
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I know.

805
00:55:30,956 --> 00:55:32,297
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to be a writing store.

806
00:55:33,177 --> 00:55:40,879
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you're staying in today, but I hope you keep up the same tradition that the Tasty Gourmet did over there also.

807
00:55:41,459 --> 00:55:42,340
[SPEAKER_01]: Good luck.

808
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:43,840
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll try to do the best we can.

809
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:44,400
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

810
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:45,260
[SPEAKER_03]: We will.

811
00:55:46,141 --> 00:55:47,141
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this Council Penta?

812
00:55:48,341 --> 00:55:50,282
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's Lisa's Pizza, correct?

813
00:55:50,462 --> 00:55:50,682
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

814
00:55:50,702 --> 00:55:50,762
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

815
00:55:50,882 --> 00:55:51,102
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

816
00:55:51,602 --> 00:55:52,763
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you tell us what you're going to do there?

817
00:55:54,098 --> 00:55:57,101
[SPEAKER_05]: Used to be a breakfast, lunch, and late afternoon sandwich place.

818
00:55:57,121 --> 00:55:58,783
[SPEAKER_05]: What's your intention for the place?

819
00:55:58,863 --> 00:55:59,463
[SPEAKER_03]: Very similar.

820
00:55:59,704 --> 00:56:02,686
[SPEAKER_03]: Breakfast, lunch, and some late dinner specials.

821
00:56:03,447 --> 00:56:04,588
[SPEAKER_05]: And what time do you expect to open?

822
00:56:05,769 --> 00:56:06,430
[SPEAKER_03]: Between 6 and 7.

823
00:56:07,171 --> 00:56:07,571
[SPEAKER_05]: In the morning?

824
00:56:07,811 --> 00:56:08,032
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

825
00:56:08,432 --> 00:56:09,933
[SPEAKER_04]: They made some hearty sandwiches.

826
00:56:11,575 --> 00:56:12,316
[SPEAKER_01]: Very good sandwiches.

827
00:56:12,956 --> 00:56:13,597
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll work on that.

828
00:56:13,617 --> 00:56:13,797
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.

829
00:56:16,870 --> 00:56:18,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have a recommendation, Mr. Counselor?

830
00:56:18,870 --> 00:56:20,031
[SPEAKER_04]: I recommend approval, Mr. President.

831
00:56:20,411 --> 00:56:23,591
[SPEAKER_04]: On the recommendation of the Chairman, a license and commission for approval.

832
00:56:23,631 --> 00:56:25,191
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait a minute, on the recommendation.

833
00:56:25,692 --> 00:56:27,832
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm looking here at your request of hours of operation.

834
00:56:27,872 --> 00:56:28,672
[SPEAKER_05]: It says 6 a.m.

835
00:56:28,712 --> 00:56:29,312
[SPEAKER_05]: to 2 a.m.

836
00:56:29,352 --> 00:56:29,972
[SPEAKER_05]: How do we do that?

837
00:56:30,532 --> 00:56:31,933
[SPEAKER_05]: You only can go to 11 o'clock at night.

838
00:56:33,453 --> 00:56:35,133
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't tell you what his hours are right now.

839
00:56:35,253 --> 00:56:37,274
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's on the application here that's been signed off.

840
00:56:37,854 --> 00:56:42,175
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that Tasty Gourmet had breakfast and things like that, so I'm not really quite sure.

841
00:56:42,275 --> 00:56:43,375
[SPEAKER_05]: But they close at 11 o'clock.

842
00:56:43,415 --> 00:56:44,335
[SPEAKER_05]: This goes to 2 a.m.

843
00:56:44,355 --> 00:56:44,775
[SPEAKER_05]: in the morning.

844
00:56:45,969 --> 00:56:47,110
[SPEAKER_05]: He has to go for a special permit.

845
00:56:47,430 --> 00:56:49,312
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if they don't, you know.

846
00:56:49,592 --> 00:56:50,293
[SPEAKER_05]: What are your hours?

847
00:56:50,373 --> 00:56:52,595
[SPEAKER_05]: You put here, you're going to stay open to 6 a.m.

848
00:56:52,635 --> 00:56:53,215
[SPEAKER_05]: to 2 a.m.

849
00:56:54,556 --> 00:56:56,518
[SPEAKER_05]: You need a special permit after 11 o'clock at night.

850
00:56:57,419 --> 00:56:58,960
[SPEAKER_03]: I was not made aware of anything like that.

851
00:56:59,401 --> 00:57:00,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody told you that?

852
00:57:00,502 --> 00:57:01,883
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't anybody read this application?

853
00:57:03,094 --> 00:57:06,316
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't be here if I hadn't been advised that I couldn't stay open until 2.

854
00:57:06,416 --> 00:57:10,139
[SPEAKER_04]: By ordinance, stores can only stay open and serve until 11 o'clock.

855
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:14,042
[SPEAKER_04]: You need a special permit to stay open until 2 in the morning.

856
00:57:14,782 --> 00:57:22,728
[SPEAKER_02]: Typically, the council has only extended those special permits, particular to a proprietor, not to a location.

857
00:57:23,128 --> 00:57:25,210
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there are only a couple locations that

858
00:57:27,022 --> 00:57:27,882
[SPEAKER_02]: There's none.

859
00:57:27,902 --> 00:57:30,383
[SPEAKER_04]: They're all to the proprietor.

860
00:57:30,403 --> 00:57:31,944
[SPEAKER_03]: Pardon me?

861
00:57:32,124 --> 00:57:34,445
[SPEAKER_05]: Lisa's Pizza is open to 2 o'clock in the morning.

862
00:57:36,166 --> 00:57:40,027
[SPEAKER_05]: He just said Lisa's Pizza is open to 2 o'clock in the morning.

863
00:57:40,067 --> 00:57:42,348
[SPEAKER_03]: But they all have special permits.

864
00:57:42,708 --> 00:57:44,789
[SPEAKER_05]: But you don't have a special permit for this location.

865
00:57:44,809 --> 00:57:47,410
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand, but when I filled out the application, nobody told me.

866
00:57:47,730 --> 00:57:49,490
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, point of information?

867
00:57:49,811 --> 00:57:50,631
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't know that.

868
00:57:50,771 --> 00:57:55,253
[SPEAKER_03]: I think right now we have to look at it because everybody at Hillside has

869
00:57:56,813 --> 00:57:59,755
[SPEAKER_03]: Late hours, early mornings, they're all by special permit.

870
00:57:59,775 --> 00:58:03,318
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all by your grandfather before the ordinance changed years ago.

871
00:58:03,358 --> 00:58:06,081
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's something we have to look at.

872
00:58:06,901 --> 00:58:09,563
[SPEAKER_03]: He came in for the common victor's license.

873
00:58:09,643 --> 00:58:17,870
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have to work with the building commission and see if his hours are transferred over.

874
00:58:18,250 --> 00:58:19,692
[SPEAKER_03]: If Tacey Gourmet before-.

875
00:58:19,792 --> 00:58:20,172
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't.

876
00:58:20,372 --> 00:58:20,913
[SPEAKER_03]: Had a special-.

877
00:58:20,973 --> 00:58:21,613
[SPEAKER_03]: He doesn't.

878
00:58:21,773 --> 00:58:22,754
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

879
00:58:22,794 --> 00:58:26,317
[SPEAKER_05]: He doesn't because he made an application months ago for which was never acted upon.

880
00:58:26,949 --> 00:58:33,375
[SPEAKER_05]: Tasty Gourmet made an application months ago to stay open until 2 AM, but then apparently it was withdrawn or what have you.

881
00:58:33,776 --> 00:58:35,657
[SPEAKER_05]: They've never been open until 2 o'clock in the morning.

882
00:58:35,677 --> 00:58:37,619
[SPEAKER_03]: We never got an application from Tasty Gourmet.

883
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:41,503
[SPEAKER_05]: I said it was withdrawn, apparently it was withdrawn.

884
00:58:41,523 --> 00:58:42,985
[SPEAKER_05]: It's never been open.

885
00:58:43,285 --> 00:58:47,129
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just saying, we never had to even come in for an application.

886
00:58:47,149 --> 00:58:48,490
[SPEAKER_05]: I think all you have to do is come.

887
00:58:49,073 --> 00:58:55,235
[SPEAKER_13]: Can we just amend the paper right here to the regular hours of operation as outlined in the ordinance, and then the gentleman can come forward for a special permit at a later date?

888
00:58:55,275 --> 00:58:57,636
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not planning on opening until September anyway, so it doesn't really matter.

889
00:59:04,079 --> 00:59:06,540
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not going to look into it, right?

890
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:06,760
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

891
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:10,761
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, he's before here for a common victor's license, OK?

892
00:59:10,801 --> 00:59:11,742
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

893
00:59:11,922 --> 00:59:17,884
[SPEAKER_03]: So if he chooses to open up at 6 or close at 2,

894
00:59:19,261 --> 00:59:24,911
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a separate issue that he's going to have to come in there and get an extended hours permit.

895
00:59:25,993 --> 00:59:28,457
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, did the previous proprietor have it?

896
00:59:28,878 --> 00:59:32,324
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't tell you that right now off the top of my head because everybody in the hillside.

897
00:59:32,978 --> 00:59:36,700
[SPEAKER_03]: has all kinds of different hours, up until four in the morning.

898
00:59:36,941 --> 00:59:40,983
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't do it off the top of my head.

899
00:59:41,023 --> 00:59:42,584
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll approve his permit.

900
00:59:43,084 --> 00:59:51,290
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I make a suggestion for the sake of justice here that we approve his permit within the, am I allowed to say that?

901
00:59:52,010 --> 00:59:54,532
[SPEAKER_04]: Just clarify this for the sake of justice.

902
00:59:55,332 --> 01:00:01,814
[SPEAKER_04]: approve his permit to the normal accepted hours of operation, and then whatever amendments need to be made, he can reapply?

903
01:00:02,355 --> 01:00:02,535
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

904
01:00:02,595 --> 01:00:03,815
[SPEAKER_03]: He's going to have to apply.

905
01:00:03,915 --> 01:00:07,977
[SPEAKER_03]: If it is, that's where the code enforcement officer comes in.

906
01:00:10,478 --> 01:00:11,298
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I think he knows.

907
01:00:11,318 --> 01:00:13,879
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

908
01:00:13,999 --> 01:00:14,539
[SPEAKER_07]: And I agree.

909
01:00:14,579 --> 01:00:17,180
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we have to move forward on the common victuals this evening.

910
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:22,662
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I'm extrapolating a lot of data right now from the city council for the last 12 years of this Medford City Council.

911
01:00:22,995 --> 01:00:26,196
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going through every single permit that was brought before this council.

912
01:00:26,776 --> 01:00:30,197
[SPEAKER_07]: And as far as being business friendly, I'm surprised at a lot of the votes.

913
01:00:30,657 --> 01:00:43,001
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that the prudent thing to do this evening is to put forward the convictionless license, which anyone is entitled to if they're working within the confinement of 7am to 11pm.

914
01:00:45,263 --> 01:00:49,365
[SPEAKER_07]: And if he wants extended hours or anything, then it's an issue for another day.

915
01:00:49,525 --> 01:00:54,328
[SPEAKER_01]: The gentleman said he's not putting an opening until September anyway, so he's got four months to change his hours.

916
01:00:54,928 --> 01:00:57,430
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. President.

917
01:00:58,690 --> 01:01:13,539
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what was mentioned here that if the gentleman filled out an application for common vigilance license and put the hours of operation down in the license and then submitted it to the city clerk's office, at some point, someone should have looked over the

918
01:01:14,302 --> 01:01:33,265
[SPEAKER_00]: the common vigilance request and said, wait a minute, you're putting in hours that don't comply with our current, uh, zoning or whatever, whatever it complies with and make the petitioner know that, uh, what the request is will require another request.

919
01:01:33,826 --> 01:01:37,446
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, and I think that's all some of us are asking that that take place.

920
01:01:37,466 --> 01:01:41,587
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause the German thought, uh, with this common vigilance license, he could open till two in the morning.

921
01:01:42,227 --> 01:01:47,471
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe next time, when someone files, that you could take a look at the application.

922
01:01:47,491 --> 01:01:50,113
[SPEAKER_03]: Point of information, Mr. President.

923
01:01:50,133 --> 01:01:51,554
[SPEAKER_03]: Point of information.

924
01:02:01,025 --> 01:02:03,347
[SPEAKER_00]: The petition is to the city council.

925
01:02:03,367 --> 01:02:06,489
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me ask a question, and this may be a legal question.

926
01:02:07,069 --> 01:02:14,975
[SPEAKER_00]: If Councilor Penta didn't pick up on that, and we voted tonight to approve this, would the gentleman have a legal issue saying, hey, the council voted for this.

927
01:02:15,435 --> 01:02:17,436
[SPEAKER_00]: I have one in the morning on this.

928
01:02:18,897 --> 01:02:19,358
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows?

929
01:02:19,718 --> 01:02:20,098
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

930
01:02:20,138 --> 01:02:21,099
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a legal expert.

931
01:02:21,339 --> 01:02:22,640
[SPEAKER_00]: He may have a leg to stand on.

932
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:24,141
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't know.

933
01:02:24,181 --> 01:02:25,082
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

934
01:02:27,705 --> 01:02:31,926
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, really, that some of this work should be done by the clerk's office.

935
01:02:34,767 --> 01:02:39,389
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's a zoning issue, but... Right.

936
01:02:39,509 --> 01:02:46,851
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's deal with the motion.

937
01:02:46,871 --> 01:02:46,972
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

938
01:02:47,092 --> 01:02:48,112
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

939
01:02:48,232 --> 01:02:52,853
[SPEAKER_07]: And whether it's the city clerk's office or the building department, I really don't care.

940
01:02:53,134 --> 01:02:55,754
[SPEAKER_07]: The gentleman has on his application 6 a.m.

941
01:02:55,774 --> 01:02:56,515
[SPEAKER_07]: to 2 a.m.

942
01:02:58,788 --> 01:03:03,335
[SPEAKER_07]: This should have been amended before it even got to this honourable body, as Councillor Mack stated.

943
01:03:04,116 --> 01:03:09,825
[SPEAKER_07]: Wherever the ball got dropped, obviously the first place that this particular document got dropped off was our city clerk's office, Mr. President.

944
01:03:10,907 --> 01:03:18,731
[SPEAKER_07]: And it shouldn't have went any further out of there with hours that were not conforming, or the hours should have been highlighted, so the building department could have picked it up.

945
01:03:19,511 --> 01:03:26,535
[SPEAKER_07]: But I certainly agree with Councilor Marks, and this is a problem that I'm seeing all too often as I look through previous records.

946
01:03:26,575 --> 01:03:28,936
[SPEAKER_01]: And the business- Did Tate and Gorman tell you they had a 2 o'clock license?

947
01:03:29,376 --> 01:03:29,496
No.

948
01:03:29,856 --> 01:03:29,996
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

949
01:03:30,016 --> 01:03:30,857
[SPEAKER_07]: The votes are staggering.

950
01:03:31,897 --> 01:03:38,221
[SPEAKER_04]: So on the motion of President Caviello for approval within the normal business hours, would you like to answer, Mr. Clark?

951
01:03:38,761 --> 01:03:38,861
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

952
01:03:39,572 --> 01:03:41,453
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion approves.

953
01:03:41,473 --> 01:03:41,593
[SPEAKER_04]: 7 to 11.

954
01:03:41,953 --> 01:03:43,854
[SPEAKER_04]: 7 to 11.

955
01:03:43,894 --> 01:03:45,635
[SPEAKER_04]: On that motion, all those in favor?

956
01:03:45,896 --> 01:03:45,956

957
01:03:45,996 --> 01:03:46,056

01:04:05,106 --> 01:04:05,166
[SPEAKER_00]: Aye.

1055
01:04:05,186 --> 01:04:05,247
[SPEAKER_00]: Aye.

1056
01:04:07,068 --> 01:04:07,208
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

1057
01:04:07,228 --> 01:04:07,288
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye

1058
01:04:09,405 --> 01:04:10,286
[SPEAKER_04]: That was passed.

1059
01:04:11,667 --> 01:04:12,107
[SPEAKER_00]: What is this?

1060
01:04:14,369 --> 01:04:15,630
[SPEAKER_04]: Ask the council, ask the council a question.

1061
01:04:15,670 --> 01:04:16,030
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1062
01:04:16,110 --> 01:04:17,031
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor, aye.

1063
01:04:46,141 --> 01:04:47,722
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll just add Carvey to this one.

1064
01:04:47,922 --> 01:04:48,042
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1065
01:04:48,062 --> 01:04:49,323
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you taking notes?

1066
01:04:49,363 --> 01:04:51,324
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm going to go powder my notes.

1067
01:04:51,344 --> 01:04:51,444
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1068
01:04:53,045 --> 01:04:54,446
[SPEAKER_11]: Motions, orders, and resolutions.

1069
01:04:54,586 --> 01:04:56,147
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1070
01:04:56,167 --> 01:04:58,568
[SPEAKER_11]: Paper 15-536 offered by Councilor Penta.

1071
01:04:59,409 --> 01:05:12,116
[SPEAKER_11]: Be it resolved that when the City Council receives a school department budget for review, an individual school breakdown of an at minimum 5% dollar allocation be separately identified for building maintenance and upkeep.

1072
01:05:12,356 --> 01:05:12,957
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Penta.

1073
01:05:14,037 --> 01:05:14,778
[SPEAKER_05]: Madam President,

1074
01:05:16,327 --> 01:05:21,111
[SPEAKER_05]: For such a long period of time, this city has been struggling with its maintenance of buildings.

1075
01:05:21,331 --> 01:05:33,161
[SPEAKER_05]: And unfortunately, this present administration, who led the charge for new school buildings, along with some community members, has dropped the ball over the last few years.

1076
01:05:33,781 --> 01:05:40,647
[SPEAKER_05]: And school buildings that are approximately 12, 13 years old are now in excess of over a million dollars worth of repairs.

1077
01:05:41,027 --> 01:05:43,149
[SPEAKER_05]: We're getting ourselves into the same position that we were

1078
01:05:43,660 --> 01:05:46,480
[SPEAKER_05]: as to why we had to build new buildings after some 50, 60 years.

1079
01:05:47,081 --> 01:05:55,642
[SPEAKER_05]: This 5% allocation is definitely within the guidelines that the Commonwealth of Mass Department of Education requires as it relates to maintenance of buildings.

1080
01:05:56,102 --> 01:06:00,343
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe that that's the law as it relates to the repayment schedule.

1081
01:06:00,463 --> 01:06:07,304
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't ever remember seeing a report from the Commonwealth of Mass saying 5% was ever put into a school department budget.

1082
01:06:08,064 --> 01:06:13,325
[SPEAKER_05]: So, in fact, we got our school budget here tonight, and we're going to be meeting, I believe, next Monday evening.

1083
01:06:13,953 --> 01:06:31,409
[SPEAKER_05]: between now and next Monday evening, I think it would be appropriate for the school department to show us by each individual school over and beyond the cost of their salaries, books, and everything else, a 5% budget allocation for school building maintenance and upkeep as we start to get ourselves going.

1084
01:06:31,709 --> 01:06:38,555
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Caviello, I want to thank him for some in his first year of his being elected to the city council some three years ago.

1085
01:06:38,615 --> 01:06:40,197
[SPEAKER_05]: He brought this to the attention of the council.

1086
01:06:41,062 --> 01:06:42,123
[SPEAKER_05]: We have asked for an update.

1087
01:06:42,143 --> 01:06:46,405
[SPEAKER_05]: We've never received an update, and we keep hearing constantly of concerns.

1088
01:06:47,186 --> 01:06:48,767
[SPEAKER_05]: Meffitt High School is a perfect example.

1089
01:06:48,827 --> 01:06:56,491
[SPEAKER_05]: The outside of the building looks like the most unappetizing or most, excuse me, unappealing entrance to any school building here in the city.

1090
01:06:57,192 --> 01:07:01,995
[SPEAKER_05]: It's recognized as being the flagship of our community, and it really doesn't do this city proud.

1091
01:07:02,435 --> 01:07:05,317
[SPEAKER_05]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I move approval.

1092
01:07:06,137 --> 01:07:10,740
[SPEAKER_05]: So in concert with what we asked for the school department on the council resolution last week,

1093
01:07:11,302 --> 01:07:22,367
[SPEAKER_05]: And we ask this also, and this shouldn't be a hard thing to do, because if the numbers are there and if they have to be added to it, if I understand correctly, the school budget is up by $1.8 million this year.

1094
01:07:23,227 --> 01:07:25,588
[SPEAKER_05]: So for whatever that represents, I don't know.

1095
01:07:26,048 --> 01:07:28,569
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think this is too important of an issue to drop by.

1096
01:07:28,589 --> 01:07:38,513
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think this desperately really needs to be in the budget each and every succeeding years, because I just don't want to see any municipal building fall into a state of disrepair.

1097
01:07:38,914 --> 01:07:39,694
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no need for it.

1098
01:07:40,588 --> 01:07:43,669
[SPEAKER_05]: And the cost is just, it would be just too much of a burdensome.

1099
01:07:44,069 --> 01:07:45,429
[SPEAKER_05]: So I move approval, Madam President.

1100
01:07:45,489 --> 01:07:45,810
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1101
01:07:45,850 --> 01:07:46,790
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion for approval.

1102
01:07:46,850 --> 01:07:47,570
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor.

1103
01:07:47,890 --> 01:07:48,450
[SPEAKER_05]: Roll call vote.

1104
01:07:48,470 --> 01:07:49,691
[SPEAKER_11]: Roll call has been requested.

1105
01:07:51,811 --> 01:07:54,952
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Marks.

1106
01:07:55,972 --> 01:07:56,873
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Madam President.

1107
01:07:57,173 --> 01:07:59,113
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is a worthy resolution.

1108
01:08:00,273 --> 01:08:09,696
[SPEAKER_00]: When we built the new schools back some 14, 15 years ago, the state under the school building assistance program required

1109
01:08:10,552 --> 01:08:19,179
[SPEAKER_00]: for the funding that we received, I believe it was 90%, that 5% be allocated to the maintenance of the schools at the time.

1110
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:27,886
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think over the last several years, myself and other members of this council have been calling for that particular 5% for the upkeep.

1111
01:08:28,447 --> 01:08:37,474
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was Councilor Caviello back, I think it was a year ago, that mentioned that our buildings require, the new buildings that we refer to, which are close to 15 years old,

1112
01:08:37,892 --> 01:08:40,974
[SPEAKER_00]: require over a million dollars worth of repairs already.

1113
01:08:41,794 --> 01:08:45,637
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think this is a great suggestion to have money allocated.

1114
01:08:46,617 --> 01:08:56,083
[SPEAKER_00]: We have only witnessed what happens when you have buildings in a city where there's no money allocated for any type of repairs or maintenance or upkeep.

1115
01:08:56,723 --> 01:09:07,310
[SPEAKER_00]: And we all know too well that what happens is you get a DPW yard that's condemned, you get a police department that's on the verge of being condemned,

1116
01:09:07,894 --> 01:09:11,995
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get a public library that is in need of dire repair.

1117
01:09:12,975 --> 01:09:18,157
[SPEAKER_00]: And this resolution, I support wholeheartedly and thank my colleague for bringing it up tonight.

1118
01:09:18,637 --> 01:09:18,937
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1119
01:09:19,157 --> 01:09:19,897
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Carviello.

1120
01:09:20,277 --> 01:09:21,438
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Madam President.

1121
01:09:21,458 --> 01:09:23,058
[SPEAKER_01]: My question is, is 5% enough?

1122
01:09:26,139 --> 01:09:26,739
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the question.

1123
01:09:28,059 --> 01:09:33,101
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's no question that the 5% is what you should have been doing every year.

1124
01:09:33,121 --> 01:09:35,141
[SPEAKER_01]: But by doing 5% after 10 years,

1125
01:09:39,684 --> 01:09:41,105
[SPEAKER_01]: How far behind the eight ball are we on this?

1126
01:09:41,925 --> 01:09:42,626
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my question.

1127
01:09:45,327 --> 01:09:45,927
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Madam President.

1128
01:09:45,947 --> 01:09:46,267
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1129
01:09:46,288 --> 01:09:47,888
[SPEAKER_11]: Councillor Knight.

1130
01:09:48,729 --> 01:09:49,949
[SPEAKER_13]: I certainly agree with my colleagues.

1131
01:09:50,130 --> 01:09:58,014
[SPEAKER_13]: Madam President, I think it's very important that we have a contingency fund available for capital improvements at our schools and our city buildings.

1132
01:09:58,574 --> 01:10:03,817
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm also pleased to hear after this weekend, I was with John McLaughlin, who's our facilities manager,

1133
01:10:04,468 --> 01:10:25,653
[SPEAKER_13]: the school department, and he's beginning the stages of implementing a preventative maintenance plan, and I think that's something that's also been lacking there, and I'm proud to see that Mr. McLaughlin has the foresight and the courage to put together a preventative maintenance plan to keep some of these costs down in the future, so I'd like to thank him for his efforts, and I'd also like to thank Councilor Penta, Councilor Caviello for bringing this issue to the table.

1134
01:10:26,173 --> 01:10:31,735
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm a firm believer in the need for a capital improvement fund, and I support this resolution wholeheartedly.

1135
01:10:34,838 --> 01:10:36,798
[SPEAKER_11]: Council President De La Ruzo.

1136
01:10:38,679 --> 01:10:42,960
[SPEAKER_04]: Madam President, I just want to add my support to this measure as well.

1137
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:44,540
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a good idea.

1138
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:47,461
[SPEAKER_04]: It's something we've spoken about continuously.

1139
01:10:47,901 --> 01:10:57,103
[SPEAKER_02]: It was part of, it was an intended part of the whole project from the beginning, and I'm glad we're focusing on this and not letting it go.

1140
01:10:57,424 --> 01:10:57,744
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1141
01:10:58,304 --> 01:11:03,205
[SPEAKER_11]: If I may, from the chair, I don't know, Council Pender, if you don't mind amending to also add the technology and the pool

1142
01:11:04,286 --> 01:11:08,269
[SPEAKER_11]: 5%.

1143
01:11:07,468 --> 01:11:08,269
[SPEAKER_11]: Roll call vote.

1144
01:11:18,996 --> 01:11:19,096
Yep.

1145
01:11:19,216 --> 01:11:26,581
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Camuso.

1146
01:11:26,621 --> 01:11:26,901
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1147
01:11:26,941 --> 01:11:28,382
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Caviello.

[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Knight.

1150
01:11:30,003 --> 01:11:30,403
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

01:11:31,624 --> 01:11:32,485
[SPEAKER_03]: President Del Rosso.

1152
01:11:32,525 --> 01:11:32,905
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_03]: Council March.

[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President.

1158
01:11:38,034 --> 01:11:38,314
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1159
01:11:38,594 --> 01:11:42,376
[SPEAKER_11]: And the roll call vote of 70 in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1160
01:11:42,396 --> 01:11:43,197
[SPEAKER_11]: The paper passes.

1161
01:11:43,817 --> 01:11:58,204
[SPEAKER_11]: Paper 15-537 offered by Council Penta be resolved a complete breakdown of man hours and salary costs from the Medford Fire Department for having a firefighter at the Medford High School be discussed.

1162
01:11:58,424 --> 01:12:02,686
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, a time sequence of when a firefighter is stationed on a daily basis to date.

1163
01:12:05,626 --> 01:12:06,106
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Pinto.

1164
01:12:06,486 --> 01:12:08,407
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm president on anyone who might be watching.

1165
01:12:08,607 --> 01:12:21,692
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I believe at some point in time while the construction was going on for the new science labs and subsequent to that, um, the alarm system, um, apparently is either not working properly or if it has been adjusted and remediated.

1166
01:12:21,912 --> 01:12:23,933
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, we still haven't gotten an answer back on that.

1167
01:12:24,393 --> 01:12:27,514
[SPEAKER_05]: And this has been going on a daily basis while school is in attendance.

1168
01:12:27,954 --> 01:12:30,295
[SPEAKER_05]: The unfortunate part about all of this is we're taking a,

1169
01:12:31,805 --> 01:12:39,310
[SPEAKER_05]: good firefighter and putting them up at the school on a daily basis, taking one firefighter off his regulatory duty.

1170
01:12:41,551 --> 01:12:44,953
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we asked for this information some three weeks ago.

1171
01:12:45,393 --> 01:12:46,774
[SPEAKER_05]: The mayor is yet to respond.

1172
01:12:47,675 --> 01:12:55,139
[SPEAKER_05]: And coincidentally regarding responses, if we looked in our packet this weekend, we're getting responses back from the mayor dating back to 2014.

1173
01:12:55,579 --> 01:12:59,282
[SPEAKER_05]: If we looked at our packet this weekend, there was a whole host of them.

1174
01:13:00,686 --> 01:13:05,770
[SPEAKER_05]: If he can go back to 2014 and he can't stay current ones, I just don't know.

1175
01:13:06,090 --> 01:13:07,531
[SPEAKER_05]: But this is too important of an issue.

1176
01:13:08,752 --> 01:13:13,315
[SPEAKER_05]: We're always looking at hiring more firemen and policemen and public safety personnel.

1177
01:13:13,595 --> 01:13:24,683
[SPEAKER_05]: But when we take one of the public safety people and have to leave them up in the school just in case the alarm goes off after we spent millions of dollars and we can't figure it out, I think there needs to be a reason why.

1178
01:13:24,943 --> 01:13:29,847
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't even know if the contractors should be held liable for this if they're the ones that knocked out the alarm system.

1179
01:13:30,282 --> 01:13:32,683
[SPEAKER_05]: But the fact of the matter is, it wasn't working.

1180
01:13:32,763 --> 01:13:35,265
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's working now, then let us be informed.

1181
01:13:35,325 --> 01:13:39,587
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's not working, I think the resolution fits the purpose.

1182
01:13:39,607 --> 01:13:43,810
[SPEAKER_05]: Because this does definitely cost us man hours and dollars on a daily basis.

1183
01:13:44,810 --> 01:13:45,110
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1184
01:13:45,631 --> 01:13:46,351
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Camuso.

1185
01:13:46,591 --> 01:13:47,532
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Madam President.

1186
01:13:47,692 --> 01:13:49,453
[SPEAKER_07]: And I agree with the resolution.

1187
01:13:49,673 --> 01:13:50,774
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we should have a breakdown.

1188
01:13:51,254 --> 01:13:53,215
[SPEAKER_07]: But Councilor Penta misspoke on one piece.

1189
01:13:53,735 --> 01:13:58,458
[SPEAKER_07]: And that is that it's not a firefighter that they're taking off an apparatus or anything in the community.

1190
01:13:58,928 --> 01:14:00,609
[SPEAKER_07]: it is actually overtime.

1191
01:14:00,909 --> 01:14:12,115
[SPEAKER_07]: So we definitely want the answers of why it's going on in the breakdown, but to say that it's coming from the fire suppression team, basically pulled out of his regular job, it's not the case.

1192
01:14:12,175 --> 01:14:13,455
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just wanted to clarify that.

1193
01:14:14,416 --> 01:14:14,916
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1194
01:14:15,016 --> 01:14:15,596
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Penta?

1195
01:14:15,956 --> 01:14:17,237
[SPEAKER_05]: Point of further clarification.

1196
01:14:17,537 --> 01:14:20,799
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand what Councilor Camus was saying, but maybe he'd understand what I was saying.

1197
01:14:21,159 --> 01:14:24,741
[SPEAKER_05]: You're taking a firefighter, whether he's on his regular tour of duty or overtime.

1198
01:14:25,061 --> 01:14:27,282
[SPEAKER_05]: If the overtime could have been used

1199
01:14:27,943 --> 01:14:31,005
[SPEAKER_05]: to augment another firefighter for a particular service, so be it.

1200
01:14:31,285 --> 01:14:35,167
[SPEAKER_05]: But you're paying overtime for a service that is not fire-related.

1201
01:14:35,247 --> 01:14:37,268
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not part of their regulatory duty.

1202
01:14:39,609 --> 01:14:40,330
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Camuso.

1203
01:14:40,690 --> 01:14:44,972
[SPEAKER_07]: If I may go back, and I've been watching the tapes the last few weeks.

1204
01:14:45,032 --> 01:14:45,853
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm keeping the tapes.

1205
01:14:46,493 --> 01:14:49,955
[SPEAKER_07]: And interesting enough, tomorrow I'll report back to the council next week.

1206
01:14:50,015 --> 01:14:53,417
[SPEAKER_07]: But you said that you're taking them away from his firefighter duties.

1207
01:14:54,177 --> 01:14:55,518
[SPEAKER_07]: And when I look at that,

1208
01:14:56,238 --> 01:14:59,459
[SPEAKER_07]: I say that that's taking it away from peace throughout the city.

1209
01:14:59,899 --> 01:15:07,642
[SPEAKER_07]: So I agree with the councillor, but I don't want people to think we're taking someone off of a fire apparatus for this particular item.

1210
01:15:08,162 --> 01:15:09,082
[SPEAKER_07]: That was what was said.

1211
01:15:09,102 --> 01:15:13,063
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to clear the record.

1212
01:15:13,524 --> 01:15:13,884
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all.

1213
01:15:14,764 --> 01:15:15,264
[SPEAKER_11]: Councillor Knight.

1214
01:15:16,004 --> 01:15:17,385
[SPEAKER_13]: Madam President, thank you very much.

1215
01:15:18,647 --> 01:15:27,011
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's safe to say that none of us want to put a price tag on public safety, and none of us want to put a price tag on what it's going to cost to keep students in Medford High School safe.

1216
01:15:27,871 --> 01:15:33,614
[SPEAKER_13]: But I think we can put a price tag on what it costs to repair the alarm system at Medford High School.

1217
01:15:34,595 --> 01:15:37,396
[SPEAKER_13]: Certainly, it's my understanding that this was a fire detail.

1218
01:15:37,516 --> 01:15:41,818
[SPEAKER_13]: This was not someone that was pulled off of a piece of apparatus or pulled out of a station.

1219
01:15:42,318 --> 01:15:44,679
[SPEAKER_13]: And it is a fire detail, so it is a fire-related issue.

1220
01:15:44,719 --> 01:15:46,180
[SPEAKER_13]: It is a fire-related responsibility.

1221
01:15:47,888 --> 01:15:49,188
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a prevention issue, Madam President.

1222
01:15:50,049 --> 01:15:50,889
[SPEAKER_13]: I like the resolution.

1223
01:15:50,909 --> 01:15:51,889
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's a good resolution.

1224
01:15:51,909 --> 01:15:53,490
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we need to know how much was spent up there.

1225
01:15:53,510 --> 01:15:55,791
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we need to know what bottom line it's coming off of.

1226
01:15:55,831 --> 01:15:57,152
[SPEAKER_13]: Is it coming off the school department's budget?

1227
01:15:57,172 --> 01:15:58,072
[SPEAKER_13]: Is it coming off of our budget?

1228
01:15:58,132 --> 01:15:59,433
[SPEAKER_13]: Is it coming out of the fire department's budget?

1229
01:15:59,733 --> 01:16:01,794
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's very important for us to know, Madam President.

1230
01:16:01,814 --> 01:16:03,654
[SPEAKER_13]: And I thank Councilor Penta for bringing the resolution forward.

1231
01:16:03,674 --> 01:16:04,935
[SPEAKER_13]: I move for approval.

1232
01:16:04,955 --> 01:16:06,596
[SPEAKER_11]: I move for approval by Councilor Penta.

1233
01:16:06,676 --> 01:16:07,356
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

1234
01:16:07,376 --> 01:16:08,296
[SPEAKER_11]: Roll call.

1235
01:16:08,317 --> 01:16:09,497
[SPEAKER_11]: Roll call has been requested.

1236
01:16:10,878 --> 01:16:11,598
[SPEAKER_11]: Please call the roll.

1237
01:16:18,087 --> 01:16:18,807
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Camuso.

1238
01:16:19,368 --> 01:16:32,053
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to, if the councilor doesn't mind amending it, to get an update from the school department on when they think the master box will be connected back to the fire alarm system, because that's actually what's going on up there.

1239
01:16:32,093 --> 01:16:34,073
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an old system trying to tie in with a new system.

1240
01:16:34,554 --> 01:16:38,155
[SPEAKER_07]: So if we could get an update on when they think it will be complete.

1241
01:16:39,115 --> 01:16:41,376
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion for approval as amended by Councilor Camuso.

1242
01:16:41,776 --> 01:16:42,877
[SPEAKER_11]: Roll call has been requested.

1243
01:16:43,857 --> 01:16:44,317
[SPEAKER_11]: Call the roll.

1244
01:16:44,618 --> 01:16:45,118
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Camuso.

1245
01:16:46,659 --> 01:16:47,339
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Cariollo?

1246
01:16:47,539 --> 01:16:47,799
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1247
01:16:48,099 --> 01:16:48,580
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Knight?

1248
01:16:49,020 --> 01:16:49,260
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1249
01:16:50,120 --> 01:16:50,880
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Del Rosso?

1250
01:16:51,100 --> 01:16:51,320
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1251
01:16:51,921 --> 01:16:52,481
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Matz?

1252
01:16:52,741 --> 01:16:53,021
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1253
01:16:53,301 --> 01:16:53,901
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Penta?

1254
01:16:53,941 --> 01:16:54,141
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1255
01:16:54,561 --> 01:16:55,442
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice-President O'Connor?

1256
01:16:56,242 --> 01:16:56,522
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1257
01:16:56,902 --> 01:17:00,803
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1258
01:17:01,243 --> 01:17:02,804
[SPEAKER_11]: Before the roll is called, Councilor Camuso.

1259
01:17:03,324 --> 01:17:04,364
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually misspoke.

1260
01:17:04,384 --> 01:17:05,065
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not overtime.

1261
01:17:05,105 --> 01:17:06,225
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually a paid detail.

1262
01:17:06,525 --> 01:17:07,605
[SPEAKER_07]: I was referring to my notes.

1263
01:17:07,685 --> 01:17:11,166
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a paid detail, an additional body that's not on the fire floor.

1264
01:17:12,347 --> 01:17:12,607
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1265
01:17:15,293 --> 01:17:27,525
[SPEAKER_11]: Paper 15-538 offered by Councillor Knight, be it resolved, the Medford City Council extend its sincere congratulations to Carol Rickenbacker on her retirement from the Medford Public Schools.

1266
01:17:30,548 --> 01:17:31,068
[SPEAKER_11]: Councillor Knight.

1267
01:17:32,450 --> 01:17:36,414
[SPEAKER_13]: Madam President, thank you very much, and Councillor Caviello is also a co-sponsor of this resolution.

1268
01:17:37,835 --> 01:17:39,156
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that all of us,

1269
01:17:40,187 --> 01:17:47,888
[SPEAKER_13]: who have gone through grade school and middle school and high school have been able to identify with one teacher who's really had a positive impact on your life.

1270
01:17:48,809 --> 01:17:51,769
[SPEAKER_13]: When I was at Medford High, that person was Jack McDevitt and Bud Kelly.

1271
01:17:52,169 --> 01:17:58,050
[SPEAKER_13]: When I was at the Brooks-Hobbs Elementary School, that person was Herbie Wells and Carol Rickenbacker.

1272
01:17:58,590 --> 01:18:00,731
[SPEAKER_13]: And, Madam President, I met Ms.

1273
01:18:00,971 --> 01:18:07,752
[SPEAKER_13]: Rickenbacker my kindergarten years at the Herbie School, and I can tell you that she was a great positive influence on my life.

1274
01:18:08,442 --> 01:18:14,344
[SPEAKER_13]: She's served the community with great integrity, great diligence, and quite frankly, she's always put the children first.

1275
01:18:15,084 --> 01:18:15,224
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

1276
01:18:15,284 --> 01:18:22,986
[SPEAKER_13]: Rickenbacker donated a number of hours of her own personal time to take photographs of students throughout the 30 plus years that she's been a teacher here.

1277
01:18:23,506 --> 01:18:29,367
[SPEAKER_13]: She's maintained a high quality and positive relationship with a number of students whose lives she's affected.

1278
01:18:29,407 --> 01:18:32,308
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, I'd ask my council colleagues to join me

1279
01:18:32,691 --> 01:18:34,212
[SPEAKER_13]: in supporting this resolution.

1280
01:18:34,452 --> 01:18:35,612
[SPEAKER_13]: She's going to be sadly missed.

1281
01:18:35,912 --> 01:18:38,453
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a void that cannot be filled here in the Medford Public Schools.

1282
01:18:38,994 --> 01:18:42,495
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's with great pleasure that I wish her congratulations.

1283
01:18:42,555 --> 01:18:45,056
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's with great pleasure that I let Ms.

1284
01:18:45,096 --> 01:18:49,218
[SPEAKER_13]: Rickenbacker know that she really earned this and that she made a great positive impact on my life.

1285
01:18:51,439 --> 01:18:52,739
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Counselor Knight.

1286
01:18:52,819 --> 01:18:53,740
[SPEAKER_04]: Counselor Caviello.

1287
01:18:53,980 --> 01:18:54,980
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1288
01:18:56,521 --> 01:18:58,902
[SPEAKER_01]: I've known Carol Rickenbacker over 30-plus years.

1289
01:18:58,982 --> 01:19:02,123
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a wonderful woman, consummate

1290
01:19:02,517 --> 01:19:06,458
[SPEAKER_01]: She's had all my kids in school, wonderful woman.

1291
01:19:07,658 --> 01:19:12,699
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time you see her smile, she's still out there taking pictures in the community every day.

1292
01:19:12,739 --> 01:19:17,080
[SPEAKER_01]: And every year I see her, when I'm at the school, she's been telling me she's going to be retiring.

1293
01:19:17,100 --> 01:19:19,340
[SPEAKER_01]: For the last 15 years, she's been retiring.

1294
01:19:19,860 --> 01:19:21,160
[SPEAKER_01]: And she keeps on hanging in there.

1295
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:28,261
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll tell you, the city is going to sadly miss a woman like her, who's pretty much dedicated her life to the kids in this community.

1296
01:19:29,022 --> 01:19:30,662
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, I congratulate her on her retirement.

1297
01:19:33,050 --> 01:19:33,830
[SPEAKER_01]: I for one will miss her.

1298
01:19:35,432 --> 01:19:35,852
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good.

1299
01:19:35,992 --> 01:19:36,753
[SPEAKER_00]: Councilor Marks.

1300
01:19:37,373 --> 01:19:38,294
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1301
01:19:38,314 --> 01:19:44,999
[SPEAKER_00]: When I saw this on the agenda, I had to think back for a second, because when you see Carol, she looks about 30 years old.

1302
01:19:45,900 --> 01:19:46,621
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing.

1303
01:19:46,681 --> 01:19:48,022
[SPEAKER_00]: The woman has not aged.

1304
01:19:48,943 --> 01:19:58,130
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember my years on the school committee back some number of years ago, and Carol was always one for education in our community.

1305
01:19:58,551 --> 01:20:01,513
[SPEAKER_00]: She was a mentor for many people, many teachers coming up.

1306
01:20:02,150 --> 01:20:05,273
[SPEAKER_00]: in the public school system, always had a smile on her face.

1307
01:20:05,333 --> 01:20:09,797
[SPEAKER_00]: I never saw her frown, never saw her in a bad mood, always smiling.

1308
01:20:11,178 --> 01:20:13,820
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, she's going to be sorely missed, Mr. President.

1309
01:20:14,381 --> 01:20:21,147
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I do wish her well in her retirement, and I look forward to seeing her around in the future, Mr. President.

1310
01:20:22,328 --> 01:20:22,708
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1311
01:20:22,728 --> 01:20:26,792
[SPEAKER_04]: So on the motion of approval by Councilor Knight, all those in favor?

1312
01:20:26,812 --> 01:20:27,292
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight?

1313
01:20:28,817 --> 01:20:31,359
[SPEAKER_13]: One thing, Mr. President, that I think we all remember about Ms.

1314
01:20:31,399 --> 01:20:38,743
[SPEAKER_13]: Rickenbacker is that she loves to pinch everybody's cheeks when they walked into the Brooks Hobbs Elementary School.

1315
01:20:39,324 --> 01:20:46,028
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think that the students going into school next year can rest assured that their cheeks will be safe from Ms.

1316
01:20:46,068 --> 01:20:48,450
[SPEAKER_13]: Rickenbacker because she will be enjoying her retirement.

1317
01:20:49,710 --> 01:20:49,991
[SPEAKER_04]: Very good.

1318
01:20:50,031 --> 01:20:51,391
[SPEAKER_04]: So on that motion, all those in favor?

1319
01:20:52,012 --> 01:20:52,232
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

1320
01:20:52,272 --> 01:20:52,552
[SPEAKER_04]: Opposed?

1321
01:20:52,612 --> 01:20:53,273
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion carries.

1322

1323
01:20:57,267 --> 01:21:00,529
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Dr. John Strella, 20 Metcalf Street.

1324
01:21:00,549 --> 01:21:07,114
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been informed by the clerk that Mr. Strella wishes to withdraw his motion.

1325
01:21:07,574 --> 01:21:11,577
[SPEAKER_04]: So on the motion of council night that it be received and placed on file, all those in favor?

1326
01:21:12,018 --> 01:21:12,818
[SPEAKER_04]: All those opposed?

1327
01:21:13,959 --> 01:21:16,021
[SPEAKER_04]: So passed.

1328
01:21:16,521 --> 01:21:18,542
[SPEAKER_04]: Papers in the hands of the clerk.

1329
01:21:24,847 --> 01:21:26,168
[SPEAKER_04]: Offered by Councilor Caviello.

1330
01:21:26,531 --> 01:21:31,674
[SPEAKER_04]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council remind our residents that Saturday at 9 a.m.

1331
01:21:31,714 --> 01:21:39,138
[SPEAKER_04]: in the City Hall parking lot, the Medford Bicycle Commission and Medford Kiwanis will be holding Bicycle Safety Day.

1332
01:21:39,258 --> 01:21:40,379
[SPEAKER_01]: Councilor Caraviello.

1333
01:21:40,639 --> 01:21:41,820
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1334
01:21:42,720 --> 01:21:49,904
[SPEAKER_01]: After, you know, since Ben Everbrook has passed away, the bike rodeo sort of languished in nowhere.

1335
01:21:50,505 --> 01:21:54,167
[SPEAKER_01]: And with the help of the Kiwanis and the Bicycle Commission,

1336
01:21:55,102 --> 01:22:01,867
[SPEAKER_01]: After about five years of delay, the bike rodeo will be back at City Hall on Saturday for all the children.

1337
01:22:02,647 --> 01:22:05,809
[SPEAKER_01]: The Kiwanis will be serving hot dogs and water and beverages for the kids.

1338
01:22:06,229 --> 01:22:10,772
[SPEAKER_01]: The Bicycle Commission is going to be doing all kinds of bike safety things for the children.

1339
01:22:11,913 --> 01:22:19,558
[SPEAKER_01]: The gentleman with the bike shop on Salem Street will be here checking for all the kids' bicycles for safety, along with the police.

1340
01:22:20,497 --> 01:22:21,558
[SPEAKER_01]: Bring your children out on Saturday.

1341
01:22:21,598 --> 01:22:27,521
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a nice day, and it's going to teach your kids some good bicycle safety, along with the adults in bicycle safety.

1342
01:22:28,201 --> 01:22:28,822
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1343
01:22:28,842 --> 01:22:29,202
[SPEAKER_00]: The President.

1344
01:22:29,222 --> 01:22:30,443
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good.

1345
01:22:30,543 --> 01:22:31,303
[SPEAKER_00]: Councilor Marks.

1346
01:22:33,404 --> 01:22:34,445
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1347
01:22:34,545 --> 01:22:48,113
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank Councilor Caviello for his involvement in this bicycle rodeo, as well as the Kiwanis, the Meffitt Police, and, as Councilor Caviello mentioned, the Bicycle Commission, which has been very proactive in our community

1348
01:22:48,563 --> 01:22:51,604
[SPEAKER_00]: moving issues of concern for bicycle safety.

1349
01:22:52,644 --> 01:23:01,005
[SPEAKER_00]: That program under Mr. Averbrook was a terrific program that taught kids safety rules about riding their bikes.

1350
01:23:01,665 --> 01:23:06,346
[SPEAKER_00]: All too often you hear horror stories of children getting struck on their bikes.

1351
01:23:07,206 --> 01:23:13,307
[SPEAKER_00]: And anything we can do as a community to promote public awareness and public safety I think goes a long way.

1352
01:23:13,347 --> 01:23:16,028
[SPEAKER_00]: And this event truly is an event that does that.

1353
01:23:16,562 --> 01:23:25,404
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to thank all the participants for putting this together, Mr. President, and hope that we get a well-attended Saturday event.

1354
01:23:26,064 --> 01:23:27,364
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much, Counselor.

1355
01:23:27,424 --> 01:23:30,084
[SPEAKER_04]: So on the motion approved by Counselor Caviello, all those in favor?

1356
01:23:30,884 --> 01:23:31,565
[SPEAKER_04]: All those opposed?

1357
01:23:32,005 --> 01:23:32,665
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

1358
01:23:32,745 --> 01:23:34,225
[SPEAKER_04]: Counselor Penta, on that motion?

1359
01:23:34,845 --> 01:23:35,185
[SPEAKER_05]: Another one.

1360
01:23:35,425 --> 01:23:36,545
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to move suspension.

1361
01:23:37,986 --> 01:23:38,726
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I clean these up?

1362
01:23:39,046 --> 01:23:40,466
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead.

1363
01:23:40,526 --> 01:23:45,587
[SPEAKER_04]: Offered by Vice President Lungo Kern, be it resolved that the Metro High School students of

1364
01:23:47,707 --> 01:23:53,550
[SPEAKER_04]: Medford be apprised of the scholarships that can be applied for through the Billy Falasca Scholarship.

1365
01:23:54,030 --> 01:23:55,731
[SPEAKER_04]: Deadline for applications is June 30.

1366
01:23:56,732 --> 01:24:05,236
[SPEAKER_04]: Application forms are available on the Medford Invitational Tournament website, www.mitbaseball.com.

1367
01:24:05,897 --> 01:24:07,037
[SPEAKER_04]: Madam Vice President.

1368
01:24:07,577 --> 01:24:10,179
[SPEAKER_11]: Just briefly, thank you, President De La Russo.

1369
01:24:11,539 --> 01:24:16,022
[SPEAKER_11]: The Billy Falasca Scholarship Fund has been running a couple of years.

1370
01:24:17,130 --> 01:24:22,352
[SPEAKER_11]: Scholarships are awarded to Medford and Malden high school students that are entering college.

1371
01:24:22,892 --> 01:24:32,095
[SPEAKER_11]: Now last year, I believe, Medford didn't, there wasn't, I don't know how many applications there were, but I know Malden, two Malden teens got the scholarship.

1372
01:24:32,155 --> 01:24:38,337
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, the Medford Invitational Tournament is looking for applications from Medford students who will be entering college.

1373
01:24:38,817 --> 01:24:44,779
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a big fundraiser coming up on the 26th of June at 7 p.m.

1374
01:24:47,448 --> 01:24:49,610
[SPEAKER_11]: And all those monies raised go to these scholarships.

1375
01:24:49,670 --> 01:24:56,296
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just want to notify all parents out there, teenagers out there, have your children apply for these scholarships.

1376
01:24:56,576 --> 01:25:00,279
[SPEAKER_11]: They definitely can help you with the college finances.

1377
01:25:00,379 --> 01:25:03,542
[SPEAKER_11]: And hopefully we can get a Medford scholarship out to somebody.

1378
01:25:03,742 --> 01:25:13,130
[SPEAKER_11]: Or the Medford Invitational Tournament and the Billy Velasquez Scholarship Committee can get some applications from Medford and get a scholarship out.

1379
01:25:13,190 --> 01:25:15,392
[SPEAKER_11]: So I want to thank the tournament

1380
01:25:16,095 --> 01:25:19,157
[SPEAKER_11]: the supporters, and hopefully we can make that happen.

1381
01:25:19,858 --> 01:25:20,198
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1382
01:25:20,879 --> 01:25:21,699
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight.

1383
01:25:21,759 --> 01:25:23,040
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you very much, Mr. President.

1384
01:25:23,361 --> 01:25:28,785
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's very important to point out, as Councilor Longo did, that on 6-26 at Anthony's and Malden, 7 p.m.

1385
01:25:28,805 --> 01:25:31,747
[SPEAKER_13]: would be the annual fundraiser for the scholarship.

1386
01:25:32,187 --> 01:25:36,671
[SPEAKER_13]: And the scholarship doesn't exist unless people from the community come out and actually support this endeavor.

1387
01:25:37,311 --> 01:25:38,352
[SPEAKER_13]: It's something that I support.

1388
01:25:38,592 --> 01:25:39,433
[SPEAKER_13]: Billy was a great guy.

1389
01:25:39,453 --> 01:25:41,314
[SPEAKER_13]: He put a lot of time, effort, and energy into this.

1390
01:25:41,875 --> 01:25:44,557
[SPEAKER_13]: It was really his baby, so to speak, Mr. President.

1391
01:25:45,092 --> 01:25:52,735
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think it's very important for people to know that all the proceeds from the event on the 26th go towards the scholarship and towards the Challenge of Baseball League.

1392
01:25:52,815 --> 01:25:57,538
[SPEAKER_13]: So I thank Councilor Longo-Curran for bringing this initiative forward, and I move approval.

1393
01:25:58,458 --> 01:26:00,219
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion of approval, all those in favor?

1394
01:26:01,159 --> 01:26:01,719
[SPEAKER_04]: Those opposed?

1395
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:03,120
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

1396
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:04,721
[SPEAKER_04]: Offered by Councilor Marks.

1397
01:26:05,341 --> 01:26:14,065
[SPEAKER_04]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council commend long-time Medford residents, Helen and Mac Masheyon, celebrating their 70th wedding anniversary.

1398
01:26:14,638 --> 01:26:20,543
[SPEAKER_04]: be it further amended that a council citation be presented counselor Marks 70 years.

1399
01:26:21,104 --> 01:26:23,345
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. President, you read that correctly.

1400
01:26:23,405 --> 01:26:24,326
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not a typo.

1401
01:26:25,988 --> 01:26:29,130
[SPEAKER_00]: 70 years of wedding bliss.

1402
01:26:29,210 --> 01:26:29,771
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine that.

1403
01:26:31,592 --> 01:26:35,976
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I saw the Mackeys not too long ago, I told them, watch out, I got another 43 years.

1404
01:26:36,276 --> 01:26:37,197
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm catching up to them.

1405
01:26:38,318 --> 01:26:39,239
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm catching up to them.

1406
01:26:40,060 --> 01:26:41,341
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to go with this honor.

1407
01:26:43,295 --> 01:26:49,598
[SPEAKER_00]: But honestly, if you know Helen and Mac, you see them around still shopping and so forth.

1408
01:26:50,158 --> 01:26:51,439
[SPEAKER_00]: They walk hand-in-hand.

1409
01:26:51,479 --> 01:26:52,959
[SPEAKER_00]: They look like a newlywed couple.

1410
01:26:53,419 --> 01:26:55,540
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is amazing, Mr. President.

1411
01:26:55,880 --> 01:27:08,846
[SPEAKER_00]: In this day and age, when you hear about divorce and, you know, you hear about the stars in California that their marriage lasts three months, you know, and to have someone that's together 70 years.

1412
01:27:09,606 --> 01:27:13,068
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, you know, it's not all, you know,

1413
01:27:13,528 --> 01:27:14,409
[SPEAKER_00]: peaches and cream.

1414
01:27:14,769 --> 01:27:16,190
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something you have to work towards.

1415
01:27:16,910 --> 01:27:19,992
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you see a couple like this, it really, truly is amazing.

1416
01:27:20,793 --> 01:27:27,257
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it inspires a lot of people to work at their marriage, you know, to go through the ups and downs.

1417
01:27:28,058 --> 01:27:36,564
[SPEAKER_00]: And ultimately, Helen and Mac are just role models for every couple that's out there and every family that's out there.

1418
01:27:36,624 --> 01:27:41,907
[SPEAKER_00]: And I truly want to wish them well wishes for their 70th wedding anniversary.

1419
01:27:43,812 --> 01:27:50,574
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope in 10 years from now that I can be wishing them a happy 80th wedding anniversary, Mr. President.

1420
01:27:50,594 --> 01:27:51,414
[SPEAKER_00]: They're right there going.

1421
01:27:51,474 --> 01:27:55,135
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we can get a citation for them, that'd be great.

1422
01:27:55,735 --> 01:27:56,095
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good.

1423
01:27:56,295 --> 01:27:57,836
[SPEAKER_04]: So on that motion, all those in favor?

1424
01:27:57,996 --> 01:27:58,356
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

1425
01:27:58,596 --> 01:27:59,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Opposed?

1426
01:27:59,236 --> 01:27:59,976
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

1427
01:28:00,677 --> 01:28:05,438
[SPEAKER_04]: Two condolences offered by Councilors Knight and Caraviello.

1428
01:28:06,118 --> 01:28:13,520
[SPEAKER_04]: We resolve that the Memphis City Council offers deep and sincere condolences to the family of Julio, Freddie,

1429
01:28:15,977 --> 01:28:17,399
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1430
01:28:19,321 --> 01:28:22,685
[SPEAKER_13]: Freddie Berusso was a fixture in West Medford.

1431
01:28:23,086 --> 01:28:27,611
[SPEAKER_13]: Many people would remember his work truck sitting out in the corner of Bower and Canal Street.

1432
01:28:28,352 --> 01:28:29,813
[SPEAKER_13]: He recently passed away this week.

1433
01:28:29,873 --> 01:28:31,075
[SPEAKER_13]: He was a good friend of mine.

1434
01:28:31,614 --> 01:28:40,881
[SPEAKER_13]: I had the privilege and pleasure of growing up with his son Danny playing little league and every other sport, park league and everything else that we could do down at place park when we were kids.

1435
01:28:41,802 --> 01:28:48,166
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, Fred joins his wife who passed away recently and I offer my deepest condolences to the family.

1436
01:28:48,186 --> 01:28:51,789
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's a very trying time for them and especially for Danny who has lost both of his parents.

1437
01:29:00,468 --> 01:29:02,408
[SPEAKER_01]: Fixture and West Medford are always there.

1438
01:29:02,428 --> 01:29:05,769
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you, one of the hardest working guys out there in West Medford.

1439
01:29:05,789 --> 01:29:07,610
[SPEAKER_01]: Always out there with his trucks, killing himself.

1440
01:29:08,470 --> 01:29:08,670
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1441
01:29:09,470 --> 01:29:12,271
[SPEAKER_01]: And I say, his sons were both friends of ours.

1442
01:29:13,211 --> 01:29:15,151
[SPEAKER_01]: And my condolences go to them.

1443
01:29:15,832 --> 01:29:16,272
[SPEAKER_04]: Very good.

1444
01:29:17,172 --> 01:29:20,333
[SPEAKER_04]: And Councilor Mox offers one be resolved at a moment's silence.

1445
01:29:20,913 --> 01:29:26,334
[SPEAKER_04]: Be held for long time Medford resident, Frances Belmonte, on her recent passing.

1446
01:29:26,774 --> 01:29:30,355
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Mox, a woman who was beautiful on the inside and out.

1447
01:29:31,512 --> 01:29:32,793
[SPEAKER_00]: Well said, Mr. President.

1448
01:29:33,433 --> 01:29:51,685
[SPEAKER_00]: If anyone knew Frances, she was a devoted mother, a devoted sister, devoted to her family and friends, someone that always had a smile on her face and will be sorely missed, Mr. President.

1449
01:29:52,585 --> 01:29:54,606
[SPEAKER_00]: She is the mother of Gene Wilder.

1450
01:29:55,067 --> 01:29:58,389
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people know Gene in the community and also the sister to

1451
01:29:59,460 --> 01:30:02,503
[SPEAKER_00]: The Andres, which is another big family in the city.

1452
01:30:03,324 --> 01:30:05,766
[SPEAKER_00]: And she will be sorely missed, Mr. President.

1453
01:30:06,347 --> 01:30:11,272
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wish the family well over these tough few days.

1454
01:30:27,266 --> 01:30:33,351
[SPEAKER_04]: Councillor Penter requests a moment of suspension on that motion.

1455
01:30:33,391 --> 01:30:37,395
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a resident who would like to speak regarding a council resolution we would discuss.

1456
01:30:38,075 --> 01:30:38,496
[SPEAKER_05]: Very good.

1457
01:30:42,999 --> 01:30:43,940
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Michael Ruggiero.

1458
01:30:43,980 --> 01:30:45,562
[SPEAKER_06]: I live on 18 Pembroke Street.

1459
01:30:45,702 --> 01:30:48,164
[SPEAKER_06]: The issue I wish to bring up is Wright's Pond.

1460
01:30:48,844 --> 01:30:53,969
[SPEAKER_06]: As this council is aware, the prices increase has been a little challenging for a number of residents that I've talked to.

1461
01:30:54,729 --> 01:31:07,117
[SPEAKER_06]: I ask that the council make available to residents under certain financial challenges perhaps 100 or 200 passes to Wrights Pond that could be, maybe they could be charged the rate that they were paid last year.

1462
01:31:08,118 --> 01:31:12,201
[SPEAKER_06]: This would be a real help to a number of families and I don't believe it would cost that much.

1463
01:31:12,621 --> 01:31:12,981
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1464
01:31:13,842 --> 01:31:15,303
[SPEAKER_13]: Point of information, Councilor Knight.

1465
01:31:15,923 --> 01:31:24,009
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe that the governing body that's in charge of the rate structures at Wrights Pond would be the Parks Board who had a hearing this evening on this very same issue.

1466
01:31:24,796 --> 01:31:33,020
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand that there was a meeting, but unfortunately, because it was exactly the same time, I had to decide if I wanted to participate in the transfers versus Rights Pond.

1467
01:31:33,060 --> 01:31:40,024
[SPEAKER_06]: I think both issues are important, but I thought the transfers being a million dollars would be something I should participate in.

1468
01:31:40,124 --> 01:31:43,566
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not questioning the use of the gentleman's time.

1469
01:31:43,646 --> 01:31:46,448
[SPEAKER_13]: I think I'm questioning whether or not this is the appropriate body that can affect that change.

1470
01:31:47,808 --> 01:31:50,830
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe the body could perhaps make a recommendation to the Parks Commission.

1471
01:31:51,412 --> 01:31:56,233
[SPEAKER_06]: to provide 100 or 200 passes to families in financial need.

1472
01:31:56,253 --> 01:32:00,435
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think that's such a difficult question to ask.

1473
01:32:01,055 --> 01:32:02,215
[SPEAKER_04]: VICE PRESIDENT LUNGELKIRK.

1474
01:32:02,315 --> 01:32:02,655
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1475
01:32:03,455 --> 01:32:05,376
[SPEAKER_11]: President De La Russo, I'm not sure if you were there.

1476
01:32:05,416 --> 01:32:16,079
[SPEAKER_11]: Judy Johnson was at our meeting, committee of the whole meeting, and she did get the paper with regards to the recommendations we made last week to actually reduce the rate back to where it was.

1477
01:32:17,116 --> 01:32:18,337
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe we'll get an answer on that.

1478
01:32:18,397 --> 01:32:20,958
[SPEAKER_11]: And if that doesn't take place, we can put a new resolve in.

1479
01:32:20,998 --> 01:32:25,501
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I think I'd like to see it go back to the rate it was or a minimal increase.

1480
01:32:25,641 --> 01:32:30,704
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, there's no reason for all of a sudden $5 to go up to $20.

1481
01:32:30,864 --> 01:32:31,645
[SPEAKER_11]: I said it last week.

1482
01:32:31,785 --> 01:32:35,447
[SPEAKER_11]: Are they looking to increase it another $300?

1483
01:32:35,927 --> 01:32:43,852
[SPEAKER_11]: But their answer, I guess, was they want to compensate for lowering the rate for disabled and senior citizens.

1484
01:32:44,278 --> 01:32:48,401
[SPEAKER_11]: which I think that's great, but I don't think it should be on the backs of the rest of the residents.

1485
01:32:48,801 --> 01:32:54,465
[SPEAKER_11]: So hopefully they do come with some answers for us and hopefully reduce the rate back to where it was.

1486
01:32:54,886 --> 01:32:56,847
[SPEAKER_11]: If not, I agree with you, maybe something like that.

1487
01:32:56,867 --> 01:32:57,808
[SPEAKER_11]: And something else can be explored.

1488
01:32:57,848 --> 01:33:06,694
[SPEAKER_06]: My concern is that because we're so close to the season, people buying tickets and buying passes, that maybe even if there is a change for next year, perhaps we could lower the rate again.

1489
01:33:07,194 --> 01:33:10,777
[SPEAKER_06]: But for this year, providing 100 passes seems like a very minimal thing.

1490
01:33:10,797 --> 01:33:12,238
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think it would help a lot of families.

1491
01:33:13,626 --> 01:33:14,406
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Caruso.

1492
01:33:15,046 --> 01:33:16,007
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1493
01:33:16,147 --> 01:33:23,788
[SPEAKER_07]: And I agree with the philosophy, but limiting it to any number, I think, is disadvantageous.

1494
01:33:25,109 --> 01:33:42,233
[SPEAKER_07]: Quite honestly, I don't know how the gentleman arbitrarily come up with that number, but I think this should be off of the same list as maybe reduced lunch in the public schools, for instance, because that 301 family that may want to go to Wright's Pond, and we're going to say, no, we're sorry, we can't allow you to go.

1495
01:33:42,801 --> 01:33:47,322
[SPEAKER_07]: I just think they should look for a better way, if there already isn't a way.

1496
01:33:47,342 --> 01:33:52,563
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not really sure, to be honest with you, if there isn't a way to do this.

1497
01:33:52,723 --> 01:33:54,624
[SPEAKER_07]: If they're already doing it.

1498
01:33:55,504 --> 01:33:59,345
[SPEAKER_12]: And I believe, Mr. President, this body voted 7-0 to ask that the rates remain the same.

1499
01:33:59,585 --> 01:33:59,805
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1500
01:34:01,085 --> 01:34:01,685
[SPEAKER_05]: Council Penton?

1501
01:34:03,326 --> 01:34:08,187
[SPEAKER_05]: While this body did ask to do that, I thank you for bringing this up again, whether it's 100, 200,

1502
01:34:09,838 --> 01:34:17,622
[SPEAKER_05]: Or maybe the simplest thing to do is just leave it at a very minimal rate, because it's a six, seven week operation at the very most, number one.

1503
01:34:17,642 --> 01:34:21,244
[SPEAKER_05]: Number two, as I said before, it's like a business.

1504
01:34:21,284 --> 01:34:22,584
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a lost leader for the city.

1505
01:34:22,624 --> 01:34:27,187
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the one thing that they can offer to this community, to the rate payers, the taxpayers, the neighbors.

1506
01:34:27,547 --> 01:34:30,428
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just for Medford folks anyway to begin with.

1507
01:34:32,129 --> 01:34:33,630
[SPEAKER_05]: Why they have to keep going up, I don't know.

1508
01:34:33,690 --> 01:34:36,311
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, does the cost of a lifeguard go up?

1509
01:34:36,331 --> 01:34:37,712
[SPEAKER_05]: Does the cost of the maintenance go up?

1510
01:34:37,752 --> 01:34:39,553
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe it does, but sometimes you have to eat that

1511
01:34:40,158 --> 01:34:43,699
[SPEAKER_05]: And tell the taxpayers, listen, you deserve something, and we're willing to pay for it.

1512
01:34:43,759 --> 01:34:47,100
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what your tax dollars is all about, helping out the community.

1513
01:34:47,421 --> 01:34:52,682
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there was a lady here last week, and she her daughter was all upset because she heard that she may not be able to go.

1514
01:34:52,722 --> 01:34:56,364
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was going to go from $5 to $20 for a walk and pass and all of that.

1515
01:34:57,244 --> 01:35:07,728
[SPEAKER_05]: I just hope that the board tonight looked at it very seriously to the point that, you know, maybe they have a little bit more leniency in their hearts, so to speak, to say, hey, you know, we just can't keep doing this.

1516
01:35:08,799 --> 01:35:14,142
[SPEAKER_05]: Just because you're going to make it easier for seniors and disability people, we're going to put it on the backs of someone else.

1517
01:35:14,182 --> 01:35:15,083
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not fair.

1518
01:35:15,183 --> 01:35:15,983
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely not fair.

1519
01:35:16,203 --> 01:35:17,404
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the worst thing you can do.

1520
01:35:17,644 --> 01:35:27,630
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the worst logic that this community can have, telling people who want to go to Wrights Pond, well, we'll reduce it for the seniors and the handicapped people, but everyone else is going to have to pay more to make up the difference.

1521
01:35:28,010 --> 01:35:29,351
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not what good government is all about.

1522
01:35:29,391 --> 01:35:30,231
[SPEAKER_05]: That's bad government.

1523
01:35:30,472 --> 01:35:34,634
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't work for the people, and it doesn't work for the city of Memphis, as far as I'm concerned.

1524
01:35:35,234 --> 01:35:36,375
[SPEAKER_05]: So I thank you for bringing it up.

1525
01:35:40,572 --> 01:35:42,093
[SPEAKER_12]: Motion received and placed on file, Mr. President.

1526
01:35:42,313 --> 01:35:44,174
[SPEAKER_04]: On that motion of council night, all those in favor?

1527
01:35:44,194 --> 01:35:44,254
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

1528
01:35:44,675 --> 01:35:45,015
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

1529
01:35:45,775 --> 01:35:46,476
[SPEAKER_04]: All those opposed?

1530
01:35:47,456 --> 01:35:49,518
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1531
01:35:49,998 --> 01:35:59,764
[SPEAKER_02]: FYI, received June 15, 2015, 927 AM, City Clerk, Medford, Massachusetts.

1532
01:36:00,905 --> 01:36:09,690
[SPEAKER_04]: Dear Medford City Council members, enclosed is a copy of a letter that went to your constituents who reside on Burgett Avenue and Sunset Avenue.

1533
01:36:10,288 --> 01:36:16,071
[SPEAKER_04]: This letter is to make them aware of an informational meeting we are holding about a new air rights project.

1534
01:36:17,572 --> 01:36:30,758
[SPEAKER_04]: Dear Burgett Sunset Road neighbors, we would like to invite you to a meeting on Tuesday, June 16, I believe that's tonight, at 6.30 to continue our discussion about the air rights project.

1535
01:36:31,258 --> 01:36:36,521
[SPEAKER_04]: We've made some progress on access issues and building design and would like your input.

1536
01:36:36,901 --> 01:36:39,022
[SPEAKER_04]: The meeting will be held in Halogen Hall,

1537
01:36:39,536 --> 01:36:41,837
[SPEAKER_04]: next to Cousins Gym in room 102.

1538
01:36:42,278 --> 01:36:44,119
[SPEAKER_04]: Sincerely yours, et cetera, et cetera.

1539
01:36:44,139 --> 01:36:44,799
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President.

1540
01:36:44,899 --> 01:36:45,319
[SPEAKER_04]: Who signed that?

1541
01:36:45,339 --> 01:36:46,220
[SPEAKER_04]: Councillor Camuso.

1542
01:36:46,740 --> 01:36:48,841
[SPEAKER_07]: And also, I'm not quite honest.

1543
01:36:48,901 --> 01:36:52,203
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure who is the authority of air rights over the city of Medford.

1544
01:36:53,084 --> 01:36:54,425
[SPEAKER_07]: Would it be the Zoning Board of Appeals?

1545
01:36:54,465 --> 01:36:55,625
[SPEAKER_07]: Would it be the DPW?

1546
01:36:55,985 --> 01:37:05,771
[SPEAKER_07]: Can we ask this to the, and when we're talking about air rights, we're talking about the proposed walkway over Boston Avenue and down at the Tufts College Ave T-stop.

1547
01:37:07,990 --> 01:37:15,514
[SPEAKER_07]: So if we could send this to the city solicitor on who the appropriate authorities are over air rights, I don't know.

1548
01:37:15,574 --> 01:37:16,675
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a unique situation.

1549
01:37:18,876 --> 01:37:25,540
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't think of any other businesses that currently or private property that do this at this point.

1550
01:37:25,620 --> 01:37:28,502
[SPEAKER_05]: Just as a point of information, you bring up a good point.

1551
01:37:28,682 --> 01:37:35,986
[SPEAKER_05]: And if I understand correctly, air rights, and this will involve Medford and Somerville, because I believe they touch on both sides.

1552
01:37:36,046 --> 01:37:37,607
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe that's a legislative enactment.

1553
01:37:38,253 --> 01:37:40,714
[SPEAKER_05]: that has to be passed.

1554
01:37:41,034 --> 01:37:44,654
[SPEAKER_05]: Not one city can just take advantage of having air rights.

1555
01:37:45,134 --> 01:37:46,735
[SPEAKER_05]: And there has to be a purpose for the air rights.

1556
01:37:47,195 --> 01:37:49,275
[SPEAKER_05]: Who is the beneficial factor to the air rights?

1557
01:37:49,375 --> 01:37:49,775
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1558
01:37:50,596 --> 01:37:52,756
[SPEAKER_05]: Who did you say said that, Barbara Rubel?

1559
01:37:53,536 --> 01:37:55,917
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish you had told the council about that ahead of time.

1560
01:38:07,063 --> 01:38:07,403
[SPEAKER_10]: Very good.

1561
01:38:08,063 --> 01:38:20,885
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, if we can, if we can amend Mr. Council President, Council Camuso's resolution, asking the question to the solicitor and also make a request from the community development and community relations specialist, Ms.

1562
01:38:20,905 --> 01:38:24,546
[SPEAKER_13]: Rubella, Tufts University to provide us with a copy of the minutes from this meeting from this evening.

1563
01:38:24,986 --> 01:38:25,326
[SPEAKER_04]: Very good.

1564
01:38:26,726 --> 01:38:35,548
[SPEAKER_04]: So on that motion of Council Camuso and that we get a report back from Barbara Rubella on the minutes of this meeting.

1565
01:38:36,103 --> 01:38:42,110
[SPEAKER_05]: Could we also amend it further, beside the minutes, any etchings, sketchings, drawings, whatever was presented this evening?

1566
01:38:42,210 --> 01:38:43,812
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that would be a good idea.

1567
01:38:43,852 --> 01:38:45,854
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe they should just come before the council.

1568
01:38:46,215 --> 01:38:52,602
[SPEAKER_04]: Be it further resolved that there be an architectural presentation of this plan to the city council.

1569
01:38:53,423 --> 01:38:54,324
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a huge building.

1570
01:38:55,205 --> 01:38:56,547
[SPEAKER_04]: It changes the whole

1571
01:38:57,420 --> 01:38:59,981
[SPEAKER_04]: visage of the vicinity.

1572
01:39:00,942 --> 01:39:02,283
[SPEAKER_04]: On that motion, all those in favor?

1573
01:39:02,303 --> 01:39:02,783
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1574
01:39:02,923 --> 01:39:03,543
[SPEAKER_04]: All those opposed?

1575
01:39:03,563 --> 01:39:04,644
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President?

1576
01:39:04,664 --> 01:39:12,068
[SPEAKER_07]: As the records of last week's meetings were sent to- For the records, just for the viewing public, City Hall will be closed tomorrow.

1577
01:39:12,988 --> 01:39:16,730
[SPEAKER_07]: So just, I think it's in honor of Bunker Hill Day.

1578

[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if we could, before that, Mr. President, on paper 15-524, we received a response back from the mayor's office.

1587
01:39:50,007 --> 01:39:52,929
[SPEAKER_00]: This paper was regarding Councilor Penta's resolution

1588
01:39:53,548 --> 01:39:57,969
[SPEAKER_00]: regarding a list of new hires and employee promotions in the school department on the city side.

1589
01:39:59,010 --> 01:40:12,374
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was passed as amended, which was Councilor Caviello's amendment, that all department heads provide at the meeting, not ahead of time, at the meeting, who the new hires and promotions were.

1590
01:40:12,834 --> 01:40:14,815
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the bottom it says paper field.

1591
01:40:18,316 --> 01:40:19,317
[SPEAKER_00]: What paper field?

1592
01:40:22,098 --> 01:40:23,238
[SPEAKER_00]: So Councilor,

[SPEAKER_00]: amendment.

1594
01:40:27,708 --> 01:40:35,750
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you mean the whole paper field?

1595
01:40:36,370 --> 01:40:40,891
[SPEAKER_07]: We voted to have that part of the budget debate.

1596
01:40:41,171 --> 01:40:44,852
[SPEAKER_00]: We voted to have that as part of our budget debate.

1597
01:41:12,529 --> 01:41:31,697
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Mr. President, let me just tell you, Mr. President, just let me tell you, I don't know what semantics are going on in this place, but it seems to me, Mr. President, that if our vote doesn't take place, I will not attend the budget meeting and I would tell my other colleagues to not attend that budget meeting.

1598
01:41:31,973 --> 01:41:38,738
[SPEAKER_00]: Counselor, I, uh, Mr. President, you were dead fast on allowing the department heads to present this information.

1599
01:41:38,998 --> 01:41:44,082
[SPEAKER_04]: And I spoke to, um, I spoke to, uh, Ms.

1600
01:41:44,122 --> 01:41:48,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Miller the day after the meeting, because I think we, this was on the Tuesday night meeting.

1601
01:41:48,526 --> 01:41:50,888
[SPEAKER_04]: So we had a Wednesday, uh, budget hearing.

1602
01:41:50,968 --> 01:41:55,491
[SPEAKER_04]: So she was working on making those, all that information prepared.

1603
01:41:55,791 --> 01:41:59,134
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was available for the request at those meetings.

1604
01:41:59,681 --> 01:42:07,447
[SPEAKER_04]: And I also had an extensive conversation with the superintendent of the schools on the matter, so I know he was working to present that as well.

1605
01:42:08,888 --> 01:42:10,989
[SPEAKER_04]: To have that, I don't know how it failed.

1606
01:42:13,571 --> 01:42:25,100
[SPEAKER_01]: It says here, on Council Appendix Motion, and then it was amended by Council Appendix Regular Address, amended by Council

1607
01:42:29,098 --> 01:42:32,501
[SPEAKER_01]: Amended by Councilor Knight, to strike the name and insert employee ID.

[SPEAKER_01]: Amended by Councilor Kerrio-Viello, that all budget hearings, at the budget hearings, the superintendent of schools, the department has provided information regarding new hires, date, salary, salaries, retirement, and if the department fails to present the information, the council will not support the budget request.

1609
01:42:49,534 --> 01:42:55,960
[SPEAKER_01]: Amended by Vice President Montgomery, that all information regarding employees be sent to the council prior to June 19th.

1610
01:42:56,878 --> 01:43:00,981
[SPEAKER_01]: Council, Penta motion to sever Councilor Caravaglio's amendment passed.

1611
01:43:02,442 --> 01:43:11,848
[SPEAKER_01]: Upon the motion by Councilor Caravaglio and on the seventh amendment on a roll call vote of four in the affirmative, three in the negative, the amendment passed.

1612
01:43:13,889 --> 01:43:21,094
[SPEAKER_01]: Upon motion by Councilor Camuso to table the paper on a roll call vote of two in the affirmative, five in the table failed.

1613
01:43:22,515 --> 01:43:25,337
[SPEAKER_01]: Motion by Councilor Penta as amended on a roll call vote

1614
01:43:25,785 --> 01:43:28,828
[SPEAKER_01]: of three in the affirmative, four in the negative.

1615
01:43:29,028 --> 01:43:29,688
[SPEAKER_01]: Motion fails.

1616
01:43:32,911 --> 01:43:34,092
[SPEAKER_01]: So the main motion that fails.

1617
01:43:37,135 --> 01:43:38,196
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it was seven.

1618
01:43:38,716 --> 01:43:41,599
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's not, if we sever something, it's not part of the main motion.

1619
01:43:41,659 --> 01:43:42,279
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that not correct?

1620
01:43:42,359 --> 01:43:46,163
[SPEAKER_03]: If we sever it, right.

1621
01:43:46,203 --> 01:43:49,626
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the one that I'm speaking of, right?

1622
01:43:50,026 --> 01:43:51,127
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one I'm speaking about.

1623
01:43:51,147 --> 01:43:51,868
[SPEAKER_00]: His motion passed.

1624
01:43:52,545 --> 01:43:53,646
[SPEAKER_00]: that the department, right.

1625
01:43:53,766 --> 01:43:59,389
[SPEAKER_00]: So the superintendent and whoever are the department heads have to come up with this information on a budget night.

1626
01:44:00,410 --> 01:44:02,491
[SPEAKER_00]: That would, that was a vote of this council that was approved.

1627
01:44:02,831 --> 01:44:05,112
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was made clear to miss Miller.

1628
01:44:05,873 --> 01:44:18,120
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, so to prepare all the department heads who we met with, uh, that they, uh, have that, uh, those items readily available for us, uh, for our deliberations in the, uh, meetings.

1629
01:44:18,941 --> 01:44:21,122
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was also, uh, made, uh,

1630
01:44:21,948 --> 01:44:25,770
[SPEAKER_04]: part of my conversation with the superintendent as such.

1631
01:44:27,030 --> 01:44:27,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Pinto.

1632
01:44:29,131 --> 01:44:43,657
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, Mr. President, tonight's resolution, if the city clerk would move it expeditiously to have this forwarded to the school department, because that 5% building maintenance dollar amount for each school needs to be included.

1633
01:44:43,697 --> 01:44:44,257
[SPEAKER_05]: We never had it.

1634
01:44:44,357 --> 01:44:45,478
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's about time we have it.

1635
01:44:45,918 --> 01:44:47,619
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think we have to start ourselves going on that.

1636
01:44:47,899 --> 01:44:49,239
[SPEAKER_05]: So this resolution that we had tonight, 15 536,

1637
01:44:52,221 --> 01:44:54,222
[SPEAKER_05]: $15,536 needs to likewise be included.

1638
01:44:54,462 --> 01:45:00,087
[SPEAKER_04]: The school committee already voted on it.

1639
01:45:00,627 --> 01:45:01,628
[SPEAKER_05]: But they can break down.

1640
01:45:01,748 --> 01:45:06,091
[SPEAKER_05]: If there is no dollar amount allocated for school maintenance, then I'm not voting for the budget.

1641
01:45:06,131 --> 01:45:07,272
[SPEAKER_05]: If there is, then I'll let them show it.

1642
01:45:13,177 --> 01:45:14,418
[SPEAKER_05]: They're voting on the budget when?

1643
01:45:15,418 --> 01:45:15,899
[SPEAKER_05]: Monday night.

1644
01:45:17,360 --> 01:45:19,962
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, they voted on it already.

1645
01:45:20,558 --> 01:45:21,418
[SPEAKER_00]: All Roy has to do.

1646
01:45:21,538 --> 01:45:23,919
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's not included, they're not going to be able to include that.

1647
01:45:23,939 --> 01:45:25,920
[SPEAKER_05]: All Roy has to do is tell us whether it is or it isn't.

1648
01:45:26,020 --> 01:45:27,080
[SPEAKER_05]: And the answer is going to be why.

1649
01:45:27,260 --> 01:45:27,420
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

1650
01:45:27,880 --> 01:45:27,960
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1651
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:45,606
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well
