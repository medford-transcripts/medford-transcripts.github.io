    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=490.026s">Mic</a>  one two, check mic one two.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=496.751s">Check</a>  this. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=497.432s">So</a>  I don't have to call for. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=499.273s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=519.814s">Kevin,</a>  we ready? <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=520.354s">All</a>  right, let's start. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=523.376s">There</a>  will be a meeting of the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=530.458s">The</a>  first item that we're going to discuss is a resolution to discuss modernization of the Human Rights Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=543.223s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=545.403s">With</a>  that, I will hand it off to Councilor Tseng, who has a presentation on this topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=551.085s">Councilor</a>  Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=551.825s">Yeah,</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=553.986s">The</a>  mic is not powered on.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=557.287s">It's</a>  not? <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=558.227s">There's</a>  a little button on. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=560.688s">Councilor</a>  Tseng's mic is not powered on. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=562.549s">There's</a>  a little button. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=564.91s">I</a>  only know this because I turned them all off last night, so I know where the power button is sort of hidden. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=574.834s">And</a>  to think we just, we just approved the funding for Medford Community Media. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=580.477s">Very</a>  recently and I don't know if you like. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=589.923s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=590.103s">Okay,</a>  Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=591.644s">Um,</a>  so, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=596.467s">The</a>  HRC update ordinance, just to reorient everyone, this is meant to expand and empower the Human Rights Commission in Medford to do more work as an advisory body in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=608.924s">I</a>  think we see the need for it so much with what's going on in the world around us. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=615.487s">and</a>  especially in the pressure that municipal and state governments are facing to disinvest from diversity, from equity and inclusive initiatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=626.153s">And</a>  so, you know, having a resident-led body like this, I think, is something that is paramount. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=634.978s">Now,</a>  what I've done over the last month is I've talked with <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=639.407s">the</a>  mayor about some recommendations or feedback that she had for this ordinance draft. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=646.61s">And</a>  then I also liaised with community members who have been former HRC members and community leaders who have been working on this draft with me together. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=659.175s">So</a>  in an email, I had a <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=663.154s">clerk</a>  heard a piece forward earlier today. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=665.195s">I</a>  attached the document which has the mayor's feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=670.076s">And</a>  I think what my goal would be for this meeting is to walk through the feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=675.078s">Point</a>  by point, I highlighted everything that would be a change. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=679.659s">And</a>  then I think we should just talk about it as a committee and then either vote to accept or not make a change. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=688.782s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=691.74s">pulling</a>  up that document, the first question that came up was the size of the Human Rights Commission, the proposed size. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=702.987s">So</a>  the original draft of the ordinance said a minimum of nine and up to 15. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=711.073s">And</a>  the mayor's kind of feedback here was that she thought that it would be hard to keep track of variable numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=718.382s">And</a>  so she would want us to adopt a solid, a clear number here. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=723.806s">And</a>  her recommendation was nine. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=727.108s">She</a>  felt that nine was plenty and a lot of, would be a lot of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=736.534s">A</a>  lot of the community members I've been talking to are a little concerned that nine is a lower number. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=743.631s">then,</a>  you know, especially when the HRC has so many different topics and realms to cover. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=751.041s">And</a>  so they would prefer to see a larger number in terms of just to get more life experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=760.593s">And</a>  so <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=762.312s">The</a>  question is what number do we go with? <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=765.854s">There's</a>  one path that is keeping the kind of multiples of three because we have mayor, council and HRC appointments. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=774.159s">Right</a>  now it's like spread a third, a third, a third. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=778.182s">So</a>  I think we should discuss if we think nine is appropriate number, 12, 15. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=785.058s">The</a>  drawback behind 12 is that it's an even number, but I think some community members have also said that in that case, if it's a 6-6 vote, then naturally the resolution shouldn't pass and that such votes would be pretty rare. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=802.467s">The</a>  kind of drawback with 15 is that I think there is more consensus that it feels like a very large number. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=810.306s">And</a>  so that's kind of the back and forth with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=813.108s">There's</a>  been some kind of suggestions, maybe we don't split appointments a third, a third, a third, maybe do three from the council, three from the mayor, and then four from the HRC's kind of like appointment list. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=828.059s">So</a>  appointing from other city commissions and like nonprofit groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=833.023s">But</a>  I wanted to open the floor to councillors to see what people thought.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=840.155s">Councilor</a>  Calhan, turning on your mic.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=842.976s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=843.677s">I</a>  just have a super quick question, which is, do I recall you saying correctly that you said before that there was some concern about being able to fill 15? <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=851.041s">Can</a>  you just talk a little bit about the balance and what people on the commission have said in an administration about filling 15 spots?</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=859.547s">I</a>  think there's a diversity of views, to be honest about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=863.049s">I've</a>  heard community members say that <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=866.931s">Some</a>  members think that we really could fill 15. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=870.332s">Some</a>  are a little bit more skeptical. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=873.634s">The</a>  administration's kind of views that 15 would be hard to fill, but nine wouldn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=877.975s">They</a>  think that we could get to nine, maybe 12, but they're a little hesitant to say that we would be able to fill 15. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=886.679s">And</a>  yeah.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=891.797s">So</a>  I feel like giving my personal thoughts, 10 still runs into the even number issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=900.479s">Is</a>  there any possibility of doing a 443 setup with four city council, four mayor, three from the appointment list?</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=918.462s">I</a>  think my personal reaction to that would be that I think there might be some pushback from community members that we would give kind of the appointment list, like a smaller slot because like there's so much to possibly a point from, for example, like the Medford Housing Authority and the why and <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=941.776s">just</a>  like the different commissions that we have, like Council on Aging, Disabilities and stuff like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=946.32s">I</a>  think there's such a list out there of potential voices to be included. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=950.863s">335</a>  then maybe? <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=957.448s">Honestly,</a>  I'm open to possibilities and we should hear from the public if there are members who have thoughts about it too.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=964.132s">Do</a>  we have any members of the public Council is our answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=967.82s">Oh,</a>  yeah, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=968.942s">I</a>  was saying, Councils are.</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=972.429s">I'm</a>  just looking at other neighboring cities, human rights commissions. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=977.811s">Somerville</a>  has seven members. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=981.692s">Cambridge,</a>  I can't find how many members on their website. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=986.613s">Not</a>  everybody has them, right. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=991.515s">What</a>  I like about nine is that it's the three through three is kind of nice and evenly split. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=998.277s">It's</a>  not an <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1000.849s">even</a>  number already. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1002.25s">Um,</a>  so I guess I'm not, uh, I don't have a concrete opinion, which makes me not want to argue one way or another. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1015.498s">So</a>  that feels difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1017.179s">I</a>  would agree if we have strongly held opinions from the public, I would be curious to hear them. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1022.823s">Um,</a>  but thank you for bringing this up.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1029.452s">Oh,</a>  Cambridge is 11, by the way.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1032.414s">Do</a>  we have any members of the public who'd like to speak about this? <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1039.018s">I</a>  see one member of the public on Zoom and one in the chambers in person. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1043.8s">How</a>  do we put this? <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1052.565s">Name</a>  and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Jennifer Yanko]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1054.486s">Jennifer</a>  Yaiko, 16 Monument Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1058.786s">I</a>  would urge the committee to think about a number higher than nine. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1066.37s">And</a>  it seems that there are lots of possibilities, but I think we want to have, I think it's important to have members from different groups in the community, like Councilor Tseng was just saying, the Medford Housing, the Elder Council, the various disability. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1085.579s">I</a>  mean, there are various groups that could, <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1087.94s">feed</a>  into the HRC. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1091.182s">So,</a>  I mean, there's 335 which gives you 11, 445 which gives you 13. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1096.945s">I</a>  mean, I think there <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1104.202s">there</a>  are various possibilities that bump it up a bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1107.745s">I</a>  think nine is sort of small because there's potentially a lot of work for a human rights council at this moment in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1119.755s">So</a>  I would argue for like three, three, five, which doesn't bring it up that much higher. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1126.41s">than</a>  what the mayor has proposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1129.431s">But</a>  it does give a bigger chunk to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1133.891s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1134.652s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1136.772s">Seeing</a>  Barry Ingber on Zoom, I'm gonna ask you to unmute. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1141.093s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Barry Ingber]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1144.293s">Barry</a>  Ingber, 9 Draper Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1148.734s">Sorry,</a>  I can't be there in person this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1151.135s">That</a>  was my plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1153.26s">Um,</a>  I want to encourage I'm sure that Councilors have looked at the work that's been delineated for the HRC and it's a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1164.334s">It's</a>  1 of the main reasons that we felt. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1169.757s">That</a>  there needed to be a larger commission that 9 was not adequate to do the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1175.182s">And</a>  the 2nd reason is the 1 that's been alluded to by Jennifer and and by a Councilor Tseng about. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1186.66s">getting</a>  the diversity of representation that the HRC needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1191.003s">In</a>  addition to city bodies, we're also thinking about nonprofit and community bodies like the mosque, like the temple, like the West Medford Community Center, organizations that might have a lot to contribute to a human rights commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1215.078s">In</a>  terms of numbers, I want to say, as a member of an official city committee, we have right now 14 members. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1226.388s">So</a>  and there's no problem with the size. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1230.271s">And</a>  there's no problem recruiting people. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1233.234s">And</a>  we don't have stipends, which hopefully will make recruiting easier for the HRC. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1239.532s">And</a>  we don't have any problem with it being an even number because unlike the city council, there are frequent absences, there are frequent openings. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1254.044s">Having</a>  a body that officially has 12 people or any other even number of people doesn't mean that there's going to be an even number at the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1263.172s">And</a>  as Councilor Tseng pointed out, even if there is an even number, so if there were 12 at the table, so you have a seven to five vote instead of a six to five vote or a seven to six vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1276.6s">It</a>  really doesn't matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1282.583s">I</a>  guess that's all that I have to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1284.084s">Thank</a>  you for the opportunity to chime in.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1292.516s">All</a>  right, well, I, I personally could, what? <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1301.703s">Whoopsie</a>  daisy. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1302.703s">Sorry</a>  about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1303.344s">I</a>  unmuted myself on Zoom while I have the microphone going. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1306.486s">So</a>  that's a little bit of feedback there. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1310.669s">Old</a>  habit. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1312.811s">I</a>  personally, personally could support the 335 model that I'm interested to hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1319.698s">what</a>  my colleagues, what my colleagues thoughts are. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1328.684s">Councilor,</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1332.187s">Councilor</a>  Callahan.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1333.068s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1333.668s">I</a>  have to say I don't I don't really have much of an opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1336.31s">I'm</a>  happy to go with what other people think is right. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1339.252s">I'm</a>  happy to go with what folks who have been on the commission feel is right. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1342.334s">I</a>  think, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1344.806s">335</a>  would be fine 444 would be fine like I don't have much of an opinion so I hope people can offer some stronger opinions in mind.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1365.238s">Councilor</a>  Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1366.879s">Yeah,</a>  I think I'd be open to opting for 335. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1370.901s">I</a>  think my only concern about it is the idea that an ultimately unlocked body is doing a lot of the appointments. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1378.466s">It's</a>  still not over half. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1380.947s">And</a>  I think that could be a question with the mayor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1386.27s">I</a>  mean, I would be open to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1390.031s">But</a>  I do think it's a logical solution. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1392.012s">Like</a>  I think if we actually think about it from a policy standpoint, it makes a lot of sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1396.575s">I</a>  think 444 also makes a lot of sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1401.398s">And</a>  if we're very worried about a tie break, we can ask the, we can make it so that the ex-officio member, like the staff liaison or the community city council liaison has a vote to break ties. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1416.542s">But</a>  it's not necessarily my preferred outcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1422.145s">I</a>  think 12 would be fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1425.206s">But,</a>  um, yeah, I don't know what you think trail living or, I guess.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1431.589s">Okay,</a>  I'll Councilor Councilor Lazzaro.</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1435.276s">Yeah,</a>  just from looking at other cities websites, Melrose has six members, Somerville has seven, Cambridge has 11, Arlington has 13, which is surprising, Revere has eight and Malden has nine. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1447.501s">So</a>  again, I don't, I would never served on the commission, I would defer to people who have as far as like strongly held opinions about, you know, reasons why <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1459.912s">one's</a>  better than another, I don't have a strong opinion about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1462.835s">So</a>  I do, again, like Councilor Callahan, I think it's probably best for us to defer to those folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1470.082s">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1471.504s">Councilor</a>  Stein, can you clarify what the appointing bodies for the five would <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1480.615s">where</a>  they would come from. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1481.376s">You</a>  said various institutions around the city, who would decide what those institutions are? <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1487.659s">And</a>  because we are adding an extra two, so I assume that that decision also need to be made at some point.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1494.902s">Yeah,</a>  so essentially the the groups that <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1502.167s">essentially</a>  reading through the point A under membership. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1509.149s">The</a>  second half of that is basically saying that the MHRC will appoint a resident from the Medford Housing Authority, and then it should appoint the rest of the members. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1521.992s">from</a>  or from, from like city commissions, community based organizations, or upon recommendations of those organizations. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1530.598s">So</a>  essentially, it's, you know, a broad definition, it's meant to capture, for example, when the city council maybe creates another ordinance, like establishing like a gender equity commission, or youth commission or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1544.046s">Allowing</a>  flexibility there. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1546.127s">Well,</a>  okay, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1547.048s">But</a>  it's not a list. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1549.029s">It's</a>  not it's not a list of <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1551.497s">these</a>  are the organizations that the MHRC has to appoint from. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1557.781s">it's</a>  saying that these are the types of organizations that they have to like appoint from. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1563.146s">Sure.</a> </p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1563.606s">But</a>  would it be the HRC itself who decides what specifically? <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1567.39s">They</a>  would take a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1568.23s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1568.41s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1568.891s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1569.131s">I</a>  gotcha. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1569.591s">That</a>  clarifies it. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1570.853s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1571.653s">I'm</a>  going to recognize Munir Jermanas on Zoom asking you to unmute. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1577.538s">Please</a>  state your name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Munir Jirmanus]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1580.501s">Hi,</a>  Munir Jermanas, 3 Summit Road in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1586.358s">I</a>  had served on the HRC for several years, four of which I was chair of the Human Rights Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1598.642s">And</a>  I do not have, you know, a very strong opinion about the total number of members, except that it would be very good if they're representative of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1615.716s">And</a>  as far as having an even or an odd number, I don't see any problem with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1622.463s">I</a>  mean, throughout my tenure at the HRC, I have never seen a split vote where, you know, where we could not make a decision based on that vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1638.523s">But</a>  what I feel strongly about are a couple of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1644.085s">First</a>  of all, that there absolutely should be a stipend associated with serving on the HRC because I have seen many cases of folks who were not able to attend the meetings because they had children that they had to take care of. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1665.363s">And</a>  so at least this would give them the option of having a babysitter or some childcare to help out. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1678.71s">And</a>  the other thing that I feel strongly about is to try and make the voice of the HRC somewhat independent of the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1691.878s">I</a>  have seen instances in which the administration has, I hate to use the word, but has co-opted the HRC in meetings where to push a certain agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1710.341s">And</a>  there's absolutely nothing wrong with the administration having a strong voice, but it also is very critical that the HRC have an independent voice. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1723.375s">And</a>  as far as somebody had mentioned that possibly that the liaison of the city <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1731.631s">should</a>  have a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1734.212s">I</a>  think that is not a very good thing to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1738.474s">The</a>  liaison is not really a part of the HRC, should not be dictating the agenda or dictating what can be discussed or what cannot be discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1749.277s">So</a>  the liaison should be there to facilitate the process of communication of the HRC with various departments and the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1760.137s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1760.477s">That's</a>  all I need to say.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1761.678s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1766.58s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Germanus.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1768.841s">Councilor</a>  Tseng I think, um I think Councilors have articulated maybe wanting to defer to, um, former members that they trust you. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1779.366s">So</a>  I think 335 is something that we should I would move to adopt. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1784.328s">Um</a>  I would motion to adopt language to create, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1790.047s">through</a>  335 model where three members are appointed by the mayor, three are appointed by the city council, and then five are appointed by the city members of the HRC. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1802.415s">And</a>  then if it becomes an issue with the mayor's administration, we can revisit it in a regular meeting or something.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1815.283s">So</a>  we have a motion from Councilor Tseng to adopt language to <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1820.607s">that</a>  motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1820.847s">I</a>  move that we change the composition of the HR C. To three members adopt appointed by the mayor three by the City Council and three by the five by the community for a total of 11. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1834.336s">Do</a>  I have a second on that motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1836.658s">Second</a>  from Councilor Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1850.887s">By</a>  the other members of the interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1852.467s">Okay,</a>  well, you've got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1857.869s">When</a>  you're ready, please call the role.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1873.533s">That's</a>  Kelly.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1875.994s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1877.715s">That's</a>  a little. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1878.615s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1881.698s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1882.718s">Chair</a>  Leming. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1883.478s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1884.419s">Four</a>  yeses, one absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1887.699s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1889.56s">I</a>  think we can just do voice votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1895.982s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1896.162s">I</a>  feel like it's more important when you do a roll call. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1900.883s">What</a>  I might say is that they actually can't hear us anyway if you're on Zoom.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1906.324s">Yeah,</a>  that is a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1907.444s">That</a>  is a continuing problem with this new <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1911.443s">Mike</a>  system. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1914.145s">In</a>  addition to, yeah, is the voice votes.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1918.848s">I'm</a>  going to recognize Councilor Tseng, um, before I quickly move on to the next point of feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1926.673s">I</a>  something I had talked with community members about we settled on where we are now, but <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1934.792s">we</a>  do create a different standard for the Medford Housing Authority by saying the HRC will appoint a member of the Medford Housing Authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1943.196s">I</a>  just wanted to see if councillors were comfortable with that or if we should just make it a recommended body. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1952.991s">Okay,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1954.952s">Moving</a>  on to the next kind of sticking point. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1958.254s">This</a>  is maybe the biggest sticking point with the mayor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1962.037s">The</a>  mayor has urged us to not give members of the HRC stipends. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1970.002s">The</a>  reasoning seems complex. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1973.003s">I</a>  don't completely understand why to be frank with everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1978.347s">I</a>  think part of it, at least <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1981.911s">way</a>  back when, when I was talking to Francis, is that people kind of want to wait until the classification compensation study comes out and to kind of find a fairer amount for all boards and commissions, because some are paid, some are not paid. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1997.977s">There's</a>  a kind of, I think there's a slight worry about that difference there, but the city council's policy, at least up until now, has been to <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2009.538s">put</a>  in stipends as we revise ordinances and to find a fair level given the work that they're doing and what paid commissions are currently paying. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2021.38s">And</a>  what I find here that this seems, this is reasonable to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2030.682s">I</a>  think there's a secondary concern as well that the mayor did actually raise that about budgeting and about <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2039.538s">worries</a>  that this would create a kind of big budget impact, but I kind of think those worries are a little unfounded, given the size of this commission and how, you know, how much the commission would be budgeted, at least in the first kind of first bit of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2059.203s">In</a>  talking to community members, I've kind of, I think everyone is <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2065.918s">I</a>  think people are pretty unanimously supporting the idea of putting stipends in. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2071.119s">I</a>  think there's a question of, do we not specify how much and then create like an empty budget line item for the mayor to fill in later? <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2082.302s">Do</a>  we lower this amount to maybe $1,000 instead of <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2087.28s">1,250,</a>  or do we just keep it the same? <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2090.942s">I</a>  think I personally would rather us just keep it the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2094.044s">I</a>  think lowering it to 1,000 maybe could be an option. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2098.987s">I</a>  think creating the kind of empty budget item thing is a little bit too unstable. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2107.372s">But</a>  I wanted to hear from Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2111.854s">Councilor</a>  Callahan.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2113.321s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2114.225s">Before</a>  I give my opinion, what is their current budget for the commission?</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2119.439s">So</a>  currently the way that the budget for the commission works is it goes through the DEI office. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2124.403s">So</a>  Francis's salary is essentially, and Francis's office costs is essentially their budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2131.508s">And</a>  this was a little bit of a kind of a sticking point as well, at least when the HRC was trying to do events and had to get approval from the DEI office for every single event. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2145.557s">And</a>  I think a very concrete example of that was the Royal House invited the HRC to co-sponsor an event, and they were told no. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2156.966s">They</a>  were rejected, and the DEI office did not give them funds to help co-sponsor the event, which was an event that I believe they had co-sponsored the year previous to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2168.374s">So</a>  I think that's why <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2170.219s">there's</a>  a big push behind creating a budget item and at least stipends for HRC members.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2177.824s">So,</a>  I'm sorry, can I just clarify? <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2179.805s">So</a>  it sounds like they don't have currently, they don't have an actual budget, but they have in the past used the DEI budget with permission.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2190.332s">Okay,</a>  thanks. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2192.233s">And</a>  then I guess I would say as a general rule, <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2197.5s">happy</a>  to hear that the council has been like one commission at a time giving small stipends. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2204.033s">I</a>  think that and I really love that <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2207.996s">the</a>  speaker brought up the idea of child care. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2212.56s">I</a>  do think that if we want a true cross section of people to be able to participate in commissions, then I think it's smart to provide a small stipend and also to provide child care. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2229.215s">I</a>  generally in terms of the budget, like I'm very aware that our budget is our whole entire city budget is minuscule and it's a miracle that we are able to run this city as well as we do on the tiny, tiny per capita budget that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2246.106s">However,</a>  I also think that we are not going to win that, you know, we're not, we're not helping ourselves when we battle over pennies. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2255.288s">And</a>  I think what we're talking about here is something that's meaningful as an unbelievably small percentage of the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2263.77s">So</a>  I would like to leave something in and I'm, I don't really have an opinion between 1000 and 1250. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2269.132s">I</a>  think 1000 would be fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2270.852s">you</a>  know, maybe that will feel have the mayor feel slightly better if we, you know, put it at 1000. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2275.495s">But</a>  I do think it's important that we're able to bring in a true cross section of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2282.941s">I</a>  think this does help. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2284.021s">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2285.943s">Councilor</a>  Lazzaro.</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2288.184s">Um,</a>  yes, I would definitely be in support of <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2293.597s">Um,</a>  a small stipend. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2295.478s">I</a>  know a few of our commissions have stipends attached them already. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2299.36s">Um,</a>  and boards of the Community Development Board has a stipend that meets very frequently. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2304.742s">But,</a>  um, and it's a really important, um, element of varsity government. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2309.445s">But</a>  I mean, this would also be <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2312.857s">a</a>  lot of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2313.718s">It</a>  would be very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2315.239s">It</a>  would be critical to the healthy functioning of our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2319.062s">Um,</a>  and it's also, you know, part of making sure that you have. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2324.867s">Just</a>  like council. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2325.508s">I</a>  don't need to repeat what Councilor Callahan said. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2327.389s">But,</a>  um Yeah, I think the stipend portion is important. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2330.932s">I</a>  think a budget line item is important again by the same token. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2337.217s">We</a>  shouldn't have to argue about pennies because it is a very large <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2340.728s">budget,</a>  I do think that there is wiggle room here. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2343.43s">And</a>  I think that we do have capacity in these small amounts to allow this commission to have some of its own authority <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2355.755s">that's</a>  what we're trying to give it. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2357.456s">It</a>  doesn't make sense to have a cross section of our residents that are truly representative if we're not giving them the authority to do things with that knowledge that they bring, um, into our city government. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2371.502s">So</a>  I would be in favor of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2373.103s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2373.423s">Just</a>  offer. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2376.124s">So</a>  12 50 across 11 people is a total of <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2383.961s">13,750</a>  across nine people. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2386.441s">It</a>  was 11,250. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2388.942s">So</a>  if it were reduced to 1,000, it would be less than the amount that they would have gotten with nine people. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2397.844s">I'm</a>  not sure if that sort of penny pinching would help with the conversations with the mayor, but that's just to offer some, just to offer some perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2408.207s">There,</a>  I agree with everybody that this is a, <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2411.473s">very</a>  small amount of money to be talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2415.496s">That</a>  being said, do we have any other motions or discussion points? <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2431.31s">Anybody</a>  from the public would like to speak, either come along to the podium or raise your hand on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2444.089s">Yeah,</a>  we actually do.</p>

    <p>[Jennifer Yanko]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2449.097s">Jennifer</a>  Yanko, 16 Monument Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2453.632s">I</a>  think, I mean, I certainly agree with Munir that it's really important that the commission have a budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2461.458s">And</a>  for the reasons that he was suggesting, you know, childcare, there's also transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2466.723s">I</a>  mean, given how much it costs to hire a babysitter, you know, if somebody is going to attend eight meetings a year and they've got to have time to get to the meeting and get home and be at the meeting, you know, that's three hours or so possibly. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2484.763s">You</a>  know, that stipend could make a big difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2487.864s">I</a>  mean, it could make it possible for them to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2490.304s">One</a>  other way of thinking about it, but I think this is probably too bureaucratic and too complicated, is that the commission have a budget and the commission then reimburse people for babysitting costs and transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2502.788s">I</a>  mean, it does add a whole level of sort of clerical work to the commission, which may not be very welcome, but it's just another way of thinking about it.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2514.038s">Barry</a>  Ingber, I'll ask you to unmute, name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Barry Ingber]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2519.68s">Barry</a>  Ingber, 9 Draper Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2523.681s">I</a>  want to thank everybody for their, all the Councilors for your comments and support. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2530.724s">I</a>  just want to, just for the record, make the point that this commission, more than most and possibly more than any, <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2544.06s">Not</a>  certainly. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2546.501s">Since</a>  we want to bring in disenfranchised members of the community, those are the folks who are most in need of a stipend in order to participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2557.687s">And</a>  so I think there's a different standard here than there would be for some other committees. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2566.292s">I</a>  would also like to make the recommendation that if you go with the lower number of 1,000 <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=2572.597s">that</a>  maybe you say 1,000 plus reimbursement for childcare and transportation costs.</p>
