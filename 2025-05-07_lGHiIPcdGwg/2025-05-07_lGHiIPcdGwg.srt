1
00:08:10,026 --> 00:08:11,807
[SPEAKER_07]: Mic one two, check mic one two.

2
00:08:16,751 --> 00:08:17,412
[SPEAKER_06]: Check this.

3
00:08:17,432 --> 00:08:19,253
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't have to call for.

4
00:08:19,273 --> 00:08:20,654
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

5
00:08:20,734 --> 00:08:22,876
All right, cool.

6
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:28,721
Make sure that my hair looks good for YouTube.

7
00:08:39,814 --> 00:08:40,334
[SPEAKER_06]: Kevin, we ready?

8
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:43,356
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's start.

9
00:08:43,376 --> 00:08:49,918
[SPEAKER_06]: There will be a meeting of the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee.

10
00:08:50,458 --> 00:09:03,203
[SPEAKER_06]: The first item that we're going to discuss is a resolution to discuss modernization of the Human Rights Commission.

11
00:09:03,223 --> 00:09:03,283
[SPEAKER_06]: And

12
00:09:05,403 --> 00:09:11,065
[SPEAKER_06]: With that, I will hand it off to Councilor Tseng, who has a presentation on this topic.

13
00:09:11,085 --> 00:09:11,805
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Tseng.

14
00:09:11,825 --> 00:09:13,706
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, sorry.

15
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:16,707
[SPEAKER_08]: The mic is not powered on.

16
00:09:17,287 --> 00:09:17,747
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not?

17
00:09:18,227 --> 00:09:19,888
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a little button on.

18
00:09:20,688 --> 00:09:22,529
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Tseng's mic is not powered on.

19
00:09:22,549 --> 00:09:24,890
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a little button.

20
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:31,732
[SPEAKER_06]: I only know this because I turned them all off last night, so I know where the power button is sort of hidden.

21
00:09:34,834 --> 00:09:38,796
[SPEAKER_06]: And to think we just, we just approved the funding for Medford Community Media.

22
00:09:40,477 --> 00:09:48,962
[SPEAKER_06]: Very recently and I don't know if you like.

23
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:50,083
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

24
00:09:50,103 --> 00:09:51,163
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, Councilor Scarpelli.

25
00:09:51,644 --> 00:09:53,325
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, so, um,

26
00:09:56,467 --> 00:10:08,303
[SPEAKER_08]: The HRC update ordinance, just to reorient everyone, this is meant to expand and empower the Human Rights Commission in Medford to do more work as an advisory body in our city.

27
00:10:08,924 --> 00:10:14,411
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we see the need for it so much with what's going on in the world around us.

28
00:10:15,487 --> 00:10:25,433
[SPEAKER_08]: and especially in the pressure that municipal and state governments are facing to disinvest from diversity, from equity and inclusive initiatives.

29
00:10:26,153 --> 00:10:34,498
[SPEAKER_08]: And so, you know, having a resident-led body like this, I think, is something that is paramount.

30
00:10:34,978 --> 00:10:38,220
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, what I've done over the last month is I've talked with

31
00:10:39,407 --> 00:10:46,450
[SPEAKER_08]: the mayor about some recommendations or feedback that she had for this ordinance draft.

32
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:57,995
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I also liaised with community members who have been former HRC members and community leaders who have been working on this draft with me together.

33
00:10:59,175 --> 00:11:02,037
[SPEAKER_08]: So in an email, I had a

34
00:11:03,154 --> 00:11:05,175
[SPEAKER_08]: clerk heard a piece forward earlier today.

35
00:11:05,195 --> 00:11:09,936
[SPEAKER_08]: I attached the document which has the mayor's feedback.

36
00:11:10,076 --> 00:11:14,198
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think what my goal would be for this meeting is to walk through the feedback.

37
00:11:15,078 --> 00:11:18,159
[SPEAKER_08]: Point by point, I highlighted everything that would be a change.

38
00:11:19,659 --> 00:11:28,762
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I think we should just talk about it as a committee and then either vote to accept or not make a change.

39
00:11:28,782 --> 00:11:28,822
[SPEAKER_08]: So,

40
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:42,767
[SPEAKER_08]: pulling up that document, the first question that came up was the size of the Human Rights Commission, the proposed size.

41
00:11:42,987 --> 00:11:49,252
[SPEAKER_08]: So the original draft of the ordinance said a minimum of nine and up to 15.

42
00:11:51,073 --> 00:11:57,117
[SPEAKER_08]: And the mayor's kind of feedback here was that she thought that it would be hard to keep track of variable numbers.

43
00:11:58,382 --> 00:12:03,786
[SPEAKER_08]: And so she would want us to adopt a solid, a clear number here.

44
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:06,948
[SPEAKER_08]: And her recommendation was nine.

45
00:12:07,108 --> 00:12:14,533
[SPEAKER_08]: She felt that nine was plenty and a lot of, would be a lot of people.

46
00:12:16,534 --> 00:12:22,918
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of the community members I've been talking to are a little concerned that nine is a lower number.

47
00:12:23,631 --> 00:12:30,119
[SPEAKER_08]: then, you know, especially when the HRC has so many different topics and realms to cover.

48
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:38,831
[SPEAKER_08]: And so they would prefer to see a larger number in terms of just to get more life experience.

49
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:41,054
[SPEAKER_08]: And so

50
00:12:42,312 --> 00:12:44,774
[SPEAKER_08]: The question is what number do we go with?

51
00:12:45,854 --> 00:12:53,559
[SPEAKER_08]: There's one path that is keeping the kind of multiples of three because we have mayor, council and HRC appointments.

52
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:56,541
[SPEAKER_08]: Right now it's like spread a third, a third, a third.

53
00:12:58,182 --> 00:13:03,125
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think we should discuss if we think nine is appropriate number, 12, 15.

54
00:13:05,058 --> 00:13:20,406
[SPEAKER_08]: The drawback behind 12 is that it's an even number, but I think some community members have also said that in that case, if it's a 6-6 vote, then naturally the resolution shouldn't pass and that such votes would be pretty rare.

55
00:13:22,467 --> 00:13:28,571
[SPEAKER_08]: The kind of drawback with 15 is that I think there is more consensus that it feels like a very large number.

56
00:13:30,306 --> 00:13:32,147
[SPEAKER_08]: And so that's kind of the back and forth with it.

57
00:13:33,108 --> 00:13:47,919
[SPEAKER_08]: There's been some kind of suggestions, maybe we don't split appointments a third, a third, a third, maybe do three from the council, three from the mayor, and then four from the HRC's kind of like appointment list.

58
00:13:48,059 --> 00:13:51,081
[SPEAKER_08]: So appointing from other city commissions and like nonprofit groups.

59
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:55,845
[SPEAKER_08]: But I wanted to open the floor to councillors to see what people thought.

60
00:14:00,155 --> 00:14:02,696
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Calhan, turning on your mic.

61
00:14:02,976 --> 00:14:03,497
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

62
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:10,881
[SPEAKER_03]: I just have a super quick question, which is, do I recall you saying correctly that you said before that there was some concern about being able to fill 15?

63
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:19,086
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you just talk a little bit about the balance and what people on the commission have said in an administration about filling 15 spots?

64
00:14:19,547 --> 00:14:22,388
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there's a diversity of views, to be honest about this.

65
00:14:23,049 --> 00:14:25,991
[SPEAKER_08]: I've heard community members say that

66
00:14:26,931 --> 00:14:29,612
[SPEAKER_08]: Some members think that we really could fill 15.

67
00:14:30,332 --> 00:14:31,813
[SPEAKER_08]: Some are a little bit more skeptical.

68
00:14:33,634 --> 00:14:37,935
[SPEAKER_08]: The administration's kind of views that 15 would be hard to fill, but nine wouldn't.

69
00:14:37,975 --> 00:14:45,498
[SPEAKER_08]: They think that we could get to nine, maybe 12, but they're a little hesitant to say that we would be able to fill 15.

70
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:46,959
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah.

71
00:14:51,797 --> 00:14:57,538
[SPEAKER_06]: So I feel like giving my personal thoughts, 10 still runs into the even number issue.

72
00:15:00,479 --> 00:15:10,821
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there any possibility of doing a 443 setup with four city council, four mayor, three from the appointment list?

73
00:15:18,462 --> 00:15:39,117
[SPEAKER_08]: I think my personal reaction to that would be that I think there might be some pushback from community members that we would give kind of the appointment list, like a smaller slot because like there's so much to possibly a point from, for example, like the Medford Housing Authority and the why and

74
00:15:41,776 --> 00:15:46,280
[SPEAKER_08]: just like the different commissions that we have, like Council on Aging, Disabilities and stuff like that.

75
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,843
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there's such a list out there of potential voices to be included.

76
00:15:50,863 --> 00:15:53,825
[SPEAKER_08]: 335 then maybe?

77
00:15:53,845 --> 00:15:53,825
335.

78
00:15:57,448 --> 00:16:02,832
[SPEAKER_08]: Honestly, I'm open to possibilities and we should hear from the public if there are members who have thoughts about it too.

79
00:16:04,132 --> 00:16:07,740
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we have any members of the public Council is our answer.

80
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:08,601
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah, sorry.

81
00:16:08,942 --> 00:16:11,427
[SPEAKER_06]: I was saying, Councils are.

82
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:17,050
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just looking at other neighboring cities, human rights commissions.

83
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:20,231
[SPEAKER_05]: Somerville has seven members.

84
00:16:21,692 --> 00:16:26,213
[SPEAKER_05]: Cambridge, I can't find how many members on their website.

85
00:16:26,613 --> 00:16:30,895
[SPEAKER_05]: Not everybody has them, right.

86
00:16:31,515 --> 00:16:38,157
[SPEAKER_05]: What I like about nine is that it's the three through three is kind of nice and evenly split.

87
00:16:38,277 --> 00:16:38,777
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not an

88
00:16:40,849 --> 00:16:42,230
[SPEAKER_05]: even number already.

89
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:54,858
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so I guess I'm not, uh, I don't have a concrete opinion, which makes me not want to argue one way or another.

90
00:16:55,498 --> 00:16:56,939
[SPEAKER_05]: So that feels difficult.

91
00:16:57,179 --> 00:17:02,222
[SPEAKER_05]: I would agree if we have strongly held opinions from the public, I would be curious to hear them.

92
00:17:02,823 --> 00:17:05,184
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but thank you for bringing this up.

93
00:17:09,452 --> 00:17:10,873
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, Cambridge is 11, by the way.

94
00:17:12,414 --> 00:17:18,938
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we have any members of the public who'd like to speak about this?

95
00:17:19,018 --> 00:17:23,780
[SPEAKER_06]: I see one member of the public on Zoom and one in the chambers in person.

96
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:29,384
[SPEAKER_06]: How do we put this?

97
00:17:32,565 --> 00:17:33,426
[SPEAKER_06]: Name and address for the record.

98
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:36,768
[SPEAKER_02]: Jennifer Yaiko, 16 Monument Street.

99
00:17:38,786 --> 00:17:45,690
[SPEAKER_02]: I would urge the committee to think about a number higher than nine.

100
00:17:46,370 --> 00:18:05,519
[SPEAKER_02]: And it seems that there are lots of possibilities, but I think we want to have, I think it's important to have members from different groups in the community, like Councilor Tseng was just saying, the Medford Housing, the Elder Council, the various disability.

101
00:18:05,579 --> 00:18:07,280
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there are various groups that could,

102
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:10,662
[SPEAKER_02]: feed into the HRC.

103
00:18:11,182 --> 00:18:16,885
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, there's 335 which gives you 11, 445 which gives you 13.

104
00:18:16,945 --> 00:18:19,807
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think there

105
00:18:24,202 --> 00:18:27,685
[SPEAKER_02]: there are various possibilities that bump it up a bit.

106
00:18:27,745 --> 00:18:38,173
[SPEAKER_02]: I think nine is sort of small because there's potentially a lot of work for a human rights council at this moment in time.

107
00:18:39,755 --> 00:18:45,980
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would argue for like three, three, five, which doesn't bring it up that much higher.

108
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:48,710
[SPEAKER_02]: than what the mayor has proposed.

109
00:18:49,431 --> 00:18:52,891
[SPEAKER_02]: But it does give a bigger chunk to the community.

110
00:18:53,891 --> 00:18:54,231
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

111
00:18:54,652 --> 00:18:55,072
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

112
00:18:56,772 --> 00:19:01,033
[SPEAKER_06]: Seeing Barry Ingber on Zoom, I'm gonna ask you to unmute.

113
00:19:01,093 --> 00:19:02,913
[SPEAKER_06]: Name and address for the record, please.

114
00:19:04,293 --> 00:19:06,414
[SPEAKER_01]: Barry Ingber, 9 Draper Street.

115
00:19:08,734 --> 00:19:11,075
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I can't be there in person this evening.

116
00:19:11,135 --> 00:19:12,255
[SPEAKER_01]: That was my plan.

117
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:24,134
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I want to encourage I'm sure that Councilors have looked at the work that's been delineated for the HRC and it's a lot.

118
00:19:24,334 --> 00:19:28,480
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 1 of the main reasons that we felt.

119
00:19:29,757 --> 00:19:34,441
[SPEAKER_01]: That there needed to be a larger commission that 9 was not adequate to do the work.

120
00:19:35,182 --> 00:19:44,851
[SPEAKER_01]: And the 2nd reason is the 1 that's been alluded to by Jennifer and and by a Councilor Tseng about.

121
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:50,102
[SPEAKER_01]: getting the diversity of representation that the HRC needs.

122
00:19:51,003 --> 00:20:13,177
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition to city bodies, we're also thinking about nonprofit and community bodies like the mosque, like the temple, like the West Medford Community Center, organizations that might have a lot to contribute to a human rights commission.

123
00:20:15,078 --> 00:20:24,666
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of numbers, I want to say, as a member of an official city committee, we have right now 14 members.

124
00:20:26,388 --> 00:20:29,170
[SPEAKER_01]: So and there's no problem with the size.

125
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:32,273
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's no problem recruiting people.

126
00:20:33,234 --> 00:20:38,379
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't have stipends, which hopefully will make recruiting easier for the HRC.

127
00:20:39,532 --> 00:20:52,883
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't have any problem with it being an even number because unlike the city council, there are frequent absences, there are frequent openings.

128
00:20:54,044 --> 00:21:02,632
[SPEAKER_01]: Having a body that officially has 12 people or any other even number of people doesn't mean that there's going to be an even number at the table.

129
00:21:03,172 --> 00:21:16,059
[SPEAKER_01]: And as Councilor Tseng pointed out, even if there is an even number, so if there were 12 at the table, so you have a seven to five vote instead of a six to five vote or a seven to six vote.

130
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,441
[SPEAKER_01]: It really doesn't matter.

131
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:24,044
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess that's all that I have to say.

132
00:21:24,084 --> 00:21:26,085
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the opportunity to chime in.

133
00:21:32,516 --> 00:21:40,862
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, I, I personally could, what?

134
00:21:41,703 --> 00:21:42,323
[SPEAKER_06]: Whoopsie daisy.

135
00:21:42,703 --> 00:21:43,264
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry about that.

136
00:21:43,344 --> 00:21:46,446
[SPEAKER_06]: I unmuted myself on Zoom while I have the microphone going.

137
00:21:46,486 --> 00:21:48,428
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's a little bit of feedback there.

138
00:21:50,669 --> 00:21:51,189
[SPEAKER_06]: Old habit.

139
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:58,695
[SPEAKER_06]: I personally, personally could support the 335 model that I'm interested to hear.

140
00:21:59,698 --> 00:22:02,680
[SPEAKER_06]: what my colleagues, what my colleagues thoughts are.

141
00:22:08,684 --> 00:22:12,127
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor, sorry.

142
00:22:12,187 --> 00:22:12,887
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Callahan.

143
00:22:13,068 --> 00:22:13,348
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

144
00:22:13,668 --> 00:22:16,290
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to say I don't I don't really have much of an opinion.

145
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:19,232
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy to go with what other people think is right.

146
00:22:19,252 --> 00:22:22,234
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy to go with what folks who have been on the commission feel is right.

147
00:22:22,334 --> 00:22:23,675
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, you know,

148
00:22:24,806 --> 00:22:33,173
[SPEAKER_03]: 335 would be fine 444 would be fine like I don't have much of an opinion so I hope people can offer some stronger opinions in mind.

149
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:46,739
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Tseng.

150
00:22:46,879 --> 00:22:50,641
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think I'd be open to opting for 335.

151
00:22:50,901 --> 00:22:58,406
[SPEAKER_08]: I think my only concern about it is the idea that an ultimately unlocked body is doing a lot of the appointments.

152
00:22:58,466 --> 00:22:59,366
[SPEAKER_08]: It's still not over half.

153
00:23:00,947 --> 00:23:05,810
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that could be a question with the mayor's office.

154
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:07,491
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I would be open to it.

155
00:23:10,031 --> 00:23:11,972
[SPEAKER_08]: But I do think it's a logical solution.

156
00:23:12,012 --> 00:23:16,555
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I think if we actually think about it from a policy standpoint, it makes a lot of sense.

157
00:23:16,575 --> 00:23:20,197
[SPEAKER_08]: I think 444 also makes a lot of sense.

158
00:23:21,398 --> 00:23:35,347
[SPEAKER_08]: And if we're very worried about a tie break, we can ask the, we can make it so that the ex-officio member, like the staff liaison or the community city council liaison has a vote to break ties.

159
00:23:36,542 --> 00:23:41,284
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's not necessarily my preferred outcome.

160
00:23:42,145 --> 00:23:44,766
[SPEAKER_08]: I think 12 would be fine.

161
00:23:45,206 --> 00:23:50,588
[SPEAKER_08]: But, um, yeah, I don't know what you think trail living or, I guess.

162
00:23:51,589 --> 00:23:53,910
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I'll Councilor Councilor Lazzaro.

163
00:23:55,276 --> 00:24:07,361
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, just from looking at other cities websites, Melrose has six members, Somerville has seven, Cambridge has 11, Arlington has 13, which is surprising, Revere has eight and Malden has nine.

164
00:24:07,501 --> 00:24:18,845
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, I don't, I would never served on the commission, I would defer to people who have as far as like strongly held opinions about, you know, reasons why

165
00:24:19,912 --> 00:24:22,775
[SPEAKER_05]: one's better than another, I don't have a strong opinion about it.

166
00:24:22,835 --> 00:24:29,442
[SPEAKER_05]: So I do, again, like Councilor Callahan, I think it's probably best for us to defer to those folks.

167
00:24:30,082 --> 00:24:30,303
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.

168
00:24:31,504 --> 00:24:39,372
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Stein, can you clarify what the appointing bodies for the five would

169
00:24:40,615 --> 00:24:41,356
[SPEAKER_06]: where they would come from.

170
00:24:41,376 --> 00:24:47,198
[SPEAKER_06]: You said various institutions around the city, who would decide what those institutions are?

171
00:24:47,659 --> 00:24:54,262
[SPEAKER_06]: And because we are adding an extra two, so I assume that that decision also need to be made at some point.

172
00:24:54,902 --> 00:24:58,904
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so essentially the the groups that

173
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:08,949
[SPEAKER_08]: essentially reading through the point A under membership.

174
00:25:09,149 --> 00:25:20,872
[SPEAKER_08]: The second half of that is basically saying that the MHRC will appoint a resident from the Medford Housing Authority, and then it should appoint the rest of the members.

175
00:25:21,992 --> 00:25:29,977
[SPEAKER_08]: from or from, from like city commissions, community based organizations, or upon recommendations of those organizations.

176
00:25:30,598 --> 00:25:41,844
[SPEAKER_08]: So essentially, it's, you know, a broad definition, it's meant to capture, for example, when the city council maybe creates another ordinance, like establishing like a gender equity commission, or youth commission or something like that.

177
00:25:44,046 --> 00:25:45,567
[SPEAKER_08]: Allowing flexibility there.

178
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:47,028
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, okay, okay.

179
00:25:47,048 --> 00:25:48,308
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's not a list.

180
00:25:49,029 --> 00:25:50,410
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not it's not a list of

181
00:25:51,497 --> 00:25:55,826
[SPEAKER_08]: these are the organizations that the MHRC has to appoint from.

182
00:25:57,781 --> 00:26:02,465
[SPEAKER_08]: it's saying that these are the types of organizations that they have to like appoint from.

183
00:26:03,146 --> 00:26:03,466
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

184
00:26:03,606 --> 00:26:07,370
[SPEAKER_06]: But would it be the HRC itself who decides what specifically?

185
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:08,090
[SPEAKER_06]: They would take a vote.

186
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:08,350
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

187
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:08,691
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

188
00:26:08,891 --> 00:26:09,111
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

189
00:26:09,131 --> 00:26:09,491
[SPEAKER_06]: I gotcha.

190
00:26:09,591 --> 00:26:10,392
[SPEAKER_06]: That clarifies it.

191
00:26:10,853 --> 00:26:11,213
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

192
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:16,958
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to recognize Munir Jermanas on Zoom asking you to unmute.

193
00:26:17,538 --> 00:26:19,480
[SPEAKER_06]: Please state your name and address for the record, please.

194
00:26:20,501 --> 00:26:24,625
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, Munir Jermanas, 3 Summit Road in Medford.

195
00:26:26,358 --> 00:26:37,382
[SPEAKER_00]: I had served on the HRC for several years, four of which I was chair of the Human Rights Commission.

196
00:26:38,642 --> 00:26:54,768
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do not have, you know, a very strong opinion about the total number of members, except that it would be very good if they're representative of the community.

197
00:26:55,716 --> 00:27:02,363
[SPEAKER_00]: And as far as having an even or an odd number, I don't see any problem with that.

198
00:27:02,463 --> 00:27:16,656
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, throughout my tenure at the HRC, I have never seen a split vote where, you know, where we could not make a decision based on that vote.

199
00:27:18,523 --> 00:27:22,885
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I feel strongly about are a couple of things.

200
00:27:24,085 --> 00:27:44,172
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, that there absolutely should be a stipend associated with serving on the HRC because I have seen many cases of folks who were not able to attend the meetings because they had children that they had to take care of.

201
00:27:45,363 --> 00:27:57,489
[SPEAKER_00]: And so at least this would give them the option of having a babysitter or some childcare to help out.

202
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:09,836
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing that I feel strongly about is to try and make the voice of the HRC somewhat independent of the administration.

203
00:28:11,878 --> 00:28:29,051
[SPEAKER_00]: I have seen instances in which the administration has, I hate to use the word, but has co-opted the HRC in meetings where to push a certain agenda.

204
00:28:30,341 --> 00:28:42,174
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's absolutely nothing wrong with the administration having a strong voice, but it also is very critical that the HRC have an independent voice.

205
00:28:43,375 --> 00:28:50,623
[SPEAKER_00]: And as far as somebody had mentioned that possibly that the liaison of the city

206
00:28:51,631 --> 00:28:53,932
[SPEAKER_00]: should have a vote.

207
00:28:54,212 --> 00:28:57,393
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is not a very good thing to have.

208
00:28:58,474 --> 00:29:08,657
[SPEAKER_00]: The liaison is not really a part of the HRC, should not be dictating the agenda or dictating what can be discussed or what cannot be discussed.

209
00:29:09,277 --> 00:29:18,941
[SPEAKER_00]: So the liaison should be there to facilitate the process of communication of the HRC with various departments and the administration.

210
00:29:20,137 --> 00:29:20,457
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

211
00:29:20,477 --> 00:29:21,658
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I need to say.

212
00:29:21,678 --> 00:29:25,600
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

213
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:28,101
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. Germanus.

214
00:29:28,841 --> 00:29:39,346
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Tseng I think, um I think Councilors have articulated maybe wanting to defer to, um, former members that they trust you.

215
00:29:39,366 --> 00:29:43,487
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think 335 is something that we should I would move to adopt.

216
00:29:44,328 --> 00:29:48,410
[SPEAKER_08]: Um I would motion to adopt language to create, um,

217
00:29:50,047 --> 00:30:01,875
[SPEAKER_08]: through 335 model where three members are appointed by the mayor, three are appointed by the city council, and then five are appointed by the city members of the HRC.

218
00:30:02,415 --> 00:30:12,801
[SPEAKER_08]: And then if it becomes an issue with the mayor's administration, we can revisit it in a regular meeting or something.

219
00:30:15,283 --> 00:30:19,706
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have a motion from Councilor Tseng to adopt language to

220
00:30:20,607 --> 00:30:20,827
[SPEAKER_06]: that motion.

221
00:30:20,847 --> 00:30:32,935
[SPEAKER_06]: I move that we change the composition of the HR C. To three members adopt appointed by the mayor three by the City Council and three by the five by the community for a total of 11.

222
00:30:34,336 --> 00:30:35,717
[SPEAKER_06]: Do I have a second on that motion?

223
00:30:36,658 --> 00:30:38,559
[SPEAKER_06]: Second from Councilor Callahan.

224
00:30:50,887 --> 00:30:52,187
[SPEAKER_06]: By the other members of the interest.

225
00:30:52,467 --> 00:30:53,828
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, well, you've got it.

226
00:30:57,869 --> 00:30:59,089
[SPEAKER_06]: When you're ready, please call the role.

227
00:31:13,533 --> 00:31:15,354
[SPEAKER_07]: That's Kelly.

228
00:31:15,994 --> 00:31:17,695
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

229
00:31:17,715 --> 00:31:18,335
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a little.

230
00:31:18,615 --> 00:31:18,735
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

231
00:31:21,698 --> 00:31:21,878
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

232
00:31:22,718 --> 00:31:23,118
[SPEAKER_06]: Chair Leming.

233
00:31:23,478 --> 00:31:23,719
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

234
00:31:24,419 --> 00:31:27,499
[SPEAKER_06]: Four yeses, one absent.

235
00:31:27,699 --> 00:31:29,100
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

236
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:35,902
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we can just do voice votes.

237
00:31:35,982 --> 00:31:36,122
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

238
00:31:36,162 --> 00:31:40,863
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like it's more important when you do a roll call.

239
00:31:40,883 --> 00:31:46,304
[SPEAKER_03]: What I might say is that they actually can't hear us anyway if you're on Zoom.

240
00:31:46,324 --> 00:31:47,384
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that is a problem.

241
00:31:47,444 --> 00:31:49,345
[SPEAKER_06]: That is a continuing problem with this new

242
00:31:51,443 --> 00:31:52,544
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike system.

243
00:31:54,145 --> 00:31:58,207
[SPEAKER_06]: In addition to, yeah, is the voice votes.

244
00:31:58,848 --> 00:32:06,412
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to recognize Councilor Tseng, um, before I quickly move on to the next point of feedback.

245
00:32:06,673 --> 00:32:12,816
[SPEAKER_08]: I something I had talked with community members about we settled on where we are now, but

246
00:32:14,792 --> 00:32:22,676
[SPEAKER_08]: we do create a different standard for the Medford Housing Authority by saying the HRC will appoint a member of the Medford Housing Authority.

247
00:32:23,196 --> 00:32:27,699
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanted to see if councillors were comfortable with that or if we should just make it a recommended body.

248
00:32:32,991 --> 00:32:34,352
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, great.

249
00:32:34,952 --> 00:32:38,174
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on to the next kind of sticking point.

250
00:32:38,254 --> 00:32:41,096
[SPEAKER_08]: This is maybe the biggest sticking point with the mayor's office.

251
00:32:42,037 --> 00:32:46,359
[SPEAKER_08]: The mayor has urged us to not give members of the HRC stipends.

252
00:32:50,002 --> 00:32:52,223
[SPEAKER_08]: The reasoning seems complex.

253
00:32:53,003 --> 00:32:56,325
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't completely understand why to be frank with everyone.

254
00:32:58,347 --> 00:33:00,268
[SPEAKER_08]: I think part of it, at least

255
00:33:01,911 --> 00:33:17,497
[SPEAKER_08]: way back when, when I was talking to Francis, is that people kind of want to wait until the classification compensation study comes out and to kind of find a fairer amount for all boards and commissions, because some are paid, some are not paid.

256
00:33:17,977 --> 00:33:28,641
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a kind of, I think there's a slight worry about that difference there, but the city council's policy, at least up until now, has been to

257
00:33:29,538 --> 00:33:40,420
[SPEAKER_08]: put in stipends as we revise ordinances and to find a fair level given the work that they're doing and what paid commissions are currently paying.

258
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:49,461
[SPEAKER_08]: And what I find here that this seems, this is reasonable to me.

259
00:33:50,682 --> 00:33:57,603
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there's a secondary concern as well that the mayor did actually raise that about budgeting and about

260
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:19,183
[SPEAKER_08]: worries that this would create a kind of big budget impact, but I kind of think those worries are a little unfounded, given the size of this commission and how, you know, how much the commission would be budgeted, at least in the first kind of first bit of time.

261
00:34:19,203 --> 00:34:24,765
[SPEAKER_08]: In talking to community members, I've kind of, I think everyone is

262
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:30,279
[SPEAKER_08]: I think people are pretty unanimously supporting the idea of putting stipends in.

263
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:41,622
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there's a question of, do we not specify how much and then create like an empty budget line item for the mayor to fill in later?

264
00:34:42,302 --> 00:34:45,923
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we lower this amount to maybe $1,000 instead of

265
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,602
[SPEAKER_08]: 1,250, or do we just keep it the same?

266
00:34:50,942 --> 00:34:54,024
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I personally would rather us just keep it the same.

267
00:34:54,044 --> 00:34:58,967
[SPEAKER_08]: I think lowering it to 1,000 maybe could be an option.

268
00:34:58,987 --> 00:35:06,391
[SPEAKER_08]: I think creating the kind of empty budget item thing is a little bit too unstable.

269
00:35:07,372 --> 00:35:09,253
[SPEAKER_08]: But I wanted to hear from Councilors.

270
00:35:11,854 --> 00:35:12,515
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Callahan.

271
00:35:13,321 --> 00:35:13,522
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.

272
00:35:14,225 --> 00:35:18,742
[SPEAKER_03]: Before I give my opinion, what is their current budget for the commission?

273
00:35:19,439 --> 00:35:23,982
[SPEAKER_08]: So currently the way that the budget for the commission works is it goes through the DEI office.

274
00:35:24,403 --> 00:35:30,767
[SPEAKER_08]: So Francis's salary is essentially, and Francis's office costs is essentially their budget.

275
00:35:31,508 --> 00:35:44,557
[SPEAKER_08]: And this was a little bit of a kind of a sticking point as well, at least when the HRC was trying to do events and had to get approval from the DEI office for every single event.

276
00:35:45,557 --> 00:35:55,104
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think a very concrete example of that was the Royal House invited the HRC to co-sponsor an event, and they were told no.

277
00:35:56,966 --> 00:36:07,654
[SPEAKER_08]: They were rejected, and the DEI office did not give them funds to help co-sponsor the event, which was an event that I believe they had co-sponsored the year previous to that.

278
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:09,155
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that's why

279
00:36:10,219 --> 00:36:17,063
[SPEAKER_08]: there's a big push behind creating a budget item and at least stipends for HRC members.

280
00:36:17,824 --> 00:36:19,305
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I'm sorry, can I just clarify?

281
00:36:19,805 --> 00:36:29,651
[SPEAKER_03]: So it sounds like they don't have currently, they don't have an actual budget, but they have in the past used the DEI budget with permission.

282
00:36:29,891 --> 00:36:30,092
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

283
00:36:30,332 --> 00:36:31,512
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, thanks.

284
00:36:32,233 --> 00:36:36,195
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I guess I would say as a general rule,

285
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:43,913
[SPEAKER_03]: happy to hear that the council has been like one commission at a time giving small stipends.

286
00:36:44,033 --> 00:36:46,397
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that and I really love that

287
00:36:47,996 --> 00:36:50,859
[SPEAKER_03]: the speaker brought up the idea of child care.

288
00:36:52,560 --> 00:37:07,053
[SPEAKER_03]: I do think that if we want a true cross section of people to be able to participate in commissions, then I think it's smart to provide a small stipend and also to provide child care.

289
00:37:09,215 --> 00:37:25,252
[SPEAKER_03]: I generally in terms of the budget, like I'm very aware that our budget is our whole entire city budget is minuscule and it's a miracle that we are able to run this city as well as we do on the tiny, tiny per capita budget that we have.

290
00:37:26,106 --> 00:37:34,748
[SPEAKER_03]: However, I also think that we are not going to win that, you know, we're not, we're not helping ourselves when we battle over pennies.

291
00:37:35,288 --> 00:37:42,510
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think what we're talking about here is something that's meaningful as an unbelievably small percentage of the budget.

292
00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:48,111
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would like to leave something in and I'm, I don't really have an opinion between 1000 and 1250.

293
00:37:49,132 --> 00:37:50,092
[SPEAKER_03]: I think 1000 would be fine.

294
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:55,235
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, maybe that will feel have the mayor feel slightly better if we, you know, put it at 1000.

295
00:37:55,495 --> 00:38:02,921
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do think it's important that we're able to bring in a true cross section of the community.

296
00:38:02,941 --> 00:38:03,621
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this does help.

297
00:38:04,021 --> 00:38:04,221
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.

298
00:38:05,943 --> 00:38:07,023
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Lazzaro.

299
00:38:08,184 --> 00:38:11,947
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, yes, I would definitely be in support of

300
00:38:13,597 --> 00:38:15,298
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, a small stipend.

301
00:38:15,478 --> 00:38:18,659
[SPEAKER_05]: I know a few of our commissions have stipends attached them already.

302
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:24,562
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and boards of the Community Development Board has a stipend that meets very frequently.

303
00:38:24,742 --> 00:38:29,345
[SPEAKER_05]: But, um, and it's a really important, um, element of varsity government.

304
00:38:29,445 --> 00:38:31,866
[SPEAKER_05]: But I mean, this would also be

305
00:38:32,857 --> 00:38:33,438
[SPEAKER_05]: a lot of work.

306
00:38:33,718 --> 00:38:35,019
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be very important.

307
00:38:35,239 --> 00:38:38,362
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be critical to the healthy functioning of our city.

308
00:38:39,062 --> 00:38:43,426
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and it's also, you know, part of making sure that you have.

309
00:38:44,867 --> 00:38:45,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Just like council.

310
00:38:45,508 --> 00:38:47,189
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't need to repeat what Councilor Callahan said.

311
00:38:47,389 --> 00:38:50,892
[SPEAKER_05]: But, um Yeah, I think the stipend portion is important.

312
00:38:50,932 --> 00:38:55,596
[SPEAKER_05]: I think a budget line item is important again by the same token.

313
00:38:57,217 --> 00:39:00,040
[SPEAKER_05]: We shouldn't have to argue about pennies because it is a very large

314
00:39:00,728 --> 00:39:03,410
[SPEAKER_05]: budget, I do think that there is wiggle room here.

315
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:14,740
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that we do have capacity in these small amounts to allow this commission to have some of its own authority

316
00:39:15,755 --> 00:39:17,296
[SPEAKER_05]: that's what we're trying to give it.

317
00:39:17,456 --> 00:39:31,182
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't make sense to have a cross section of our residents that are truly representative if we're not giving them the authority to do things with that knowledge that they bring, um, into our city government.

318
00:39:31,502 --> 00:39:32,723
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would be in favor of it.

319
00:39:33,103 --> 00:39:33,403
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

320
00:39:33,423 --> 00:39:36,084
[SPEAKER_06]: Just offer.

321
00:39:36,124 --> 00:39:38,586
[SPEAKER_06]: So 12 50 across 11 people is a total of

322
00:39:43,961 --> 00:39:46,401
[SPEAKER_06]: 13,750 across nine people.

323
00:39:46,441 --> 00:39:46,761
[SPEAKER_06]: It was 11,250.

324
00:39:48,942 --> 00:39:56,264
[SPEAKER_06]: So if it were reduced to 1,000, it would be less than the amount that they would have gotten with nine people.

325
00:39:57,844 --> 00:40:06,447
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure if that sort of penny pinching would help with the conversations with the mayor, but that's just to offer some, just to offer some perspective.

326
00:40:08,207 --> 00:40:10,248
[SPEAKER_06]: There, I agree with everybody that this is a,

327
00:40:11,473 --> 00:40:15,476
[SPEAKER_06]: very small amount of money to be talking about.

328
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:30,269
[SPEAKER_06]: That being said, do we have any other motions or discussion points?

329
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:36,374
[SPEAKER_06]: Anybody from the public would like to speak, either come along to the podium or raise your hand on Zoom.

330
00:40:44,089 --> 00:40:48,896
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we actually do.

331
00:40:49,097 --> 00:40:50,919
[SPEAKER_02]: Jennifer Yanko, 16 Monument Street.

332
00:40:53,632 --> 00:41:00,978
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, I mean, I certainly agree with Munir that it's really important that the commission have a budget.

333
00:41:01,458 --> 00:41:06,703
[SPEAKER_02]: And for the reasons that he was suggesting, you know, childcare, there's also transportation.

334
00:41:06,723 --> 00:41:21,515
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, given how much it costs to hire a babysitter, you know, if somebody is going to attend eight meetings a year and they've got to have time to get to the meeting and get home and be at the meeting, you know, that's three hours or so possibly.

335
00:41:24,763 --> 00:41:27,624
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that stipend could make a big difference.

336
00:41:27,864 --> 00:41:29,924
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it could make it possible for them to do it.

337
00:41:30,304 --> 00:41:42,548
[SPEAKER_02]: One other way of thinking about it, but I think this is probably too bureaucratic and too complicated, is that the commission have a budget and the commission then reimburse people for babysitting costs and transportation.

338
00:41:42,788 --> 00:41:51,090
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it does add a whole level of sort of clerical work to the commission, which may not be very welcome, but it's just another way of thinking about it.

339
00:41:54,038 --> 00:41:58,319
[SPEAKER_06]: Barry Ingber, I'll ask you to unmute, name and address for the record, please.

340
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,501
[SPEAKER_01]: Barry Ingber, 9 Draper Street.

341
00:42:03,681 --> 00:42:09,583
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank everybody for their, all the Councilors for your comments and support.

342
00:42:10,724 --> 00:42:21,267
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to, just for the record, make the point that this commission, more than most and possibly more than any,

343
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:24,981
[SPEAKER_01]: Not certainly.

344
00:42:26,501 --> 00:42:36,787
[SPEAKER_01]: Since we want to bring in disenfranchised members of the community, those are the folks who are most in need of a stipend in order to participate.

345
00:42:37,687 --> 00:42:44,611
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think there's a different standard here than there would be for some other committees.

346
00:42:46,292 --> 00:42:50,714
[SPEAKER_01]: I would also like to make the recommendation that if you go with the lower number of 1,000

347
00:42:52,597 --> 00:42:59,519
[SPEAKER_01]: that maybe you say 1,000 plus reimbursement for childcare and transportation costs.

348
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:06,741
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Callahan.

349
00:43:08,801 --> 00:43:09,762
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, hello.

350
00:43:09,822 --> 00:43:11,542
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't press my button, but that's fine.

351
00:43:11,802 --> 00:43:12,802
[SPEAKER_03]: I will speak away.

352
00:43:12,862 --> 00:43:13,202
[SPEAKER_03]: I think.

353
00:43:13,222 --> 00:43:14,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it was green, sorry.

354
00:43:15,362 --> 00:43:16,803
[SPEAKER_03]: that I must have accidentally pressed it.

355
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:17,283
[SPEAKER_03]: That's OK.

356
00:43:17,343 --> 00:43:18,203
[SPEAKER_03]: I will speak anyway.

357
00:43:18,263 --> 00:43:19,264
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm always prepared.

358
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:21,785
[SPEAKER_03]: Always prepared to talk.

359
00:43:22,625 --> 00:43:26,167
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to try and move us along, because I know we have other things to cover in this meeting.

360
00:43:26,187 --> 00:43:27,067
[SPEAKER_03]: We have another meeting after this.

361
00:43:27,367 --> 00:43:28,708
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to say, let's go with $1,250.

362
00:43:29,989 --> 00:43:30,209
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

363
00:43:31,909 --> 00:43:32,149
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool.

364
00:43:32,190 --> 00:43:33,350
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, in that case, no motions.

365
00:43:34,190 --> 00:43:36,792
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think we can make a motion at the end, if that's all right.

366
00:43:37,072 --> 00:43:39,873
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I mean, it's already $1,250 in there in the current draft.

367
00:43:39,893 --> 00:43:40,813
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, let's keep it at $1,250 and move on.

368
00:43:43,153 --> 00:43:44,234
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, anything else?

369
00:43:44,514 --> 00:43:45,254
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor?

370
00:43:45,274 --> 00:43:47,275
[SPEAKER_06]: It says Scarpellion here.

371
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:48,736
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Tseng?

372
00:43:49,256 --> 00:43:50,817
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm happy to move on to the next point.

373
00:43:51,957 --> 00:43:55,779
[SPEAKER_08]: So the mayor also requested the ability to remove her own appointees.

374
00:43:56,679 --> 00:44:00,421
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I drafted some language allowing for that.

375
00:44:00,641 --> 00:44:08,145
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think if we choose to do that, it would only make sense for city council to be able to remove their own too.

376
00:44:09,075 --> 00:44:11,177
[SPEAKER_08]: This has kind of become a very big point of discussion.

377
00:44:11,378 --> 00:44:23,792
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the argument for adopting the mayor's amendment is, at least from her side, she just wants to be able to hold her own appointees accountable if they say something wildly off.

378
00:44:24,482 --> 00:44:29,084
[SPEAKER_08]: off-color or do something that is wildly off-base.

379
00:44:30,185 --> 00:44:44,711
[SPEAKER_08]: And she would want the ability to remove her own appointments and essentially use that in the backup in case the rest of HRC is unwilling to vote that person off.

380
00:44:45,272 --> 00:44:51,214
[SPEAKER_08]: The kind of pushback against that is that I worry that this would

381
00:44:53,475 --> 00:44:59,936
[SPEAKER_08]: endanger the political independence of the HRC, because then the question is, what does forecast mean?

382
00:45:01,057 --> 00:45:05,158
[SPEAKER_08]: So how high of a bar is forecast for removal?

383
00:45:05,418 --> 00:45:15,260
[SPEAKER_08]: So if the kind of, if her appointee to the HRC says something about a human rights crisis that is very different from what the mayor's views are,

384
00:45:16,573 --> 00:45:19,695
[SPEAKER_08]: is that then a problem, right?

385
00:45:20,555 --> 00:45:29,340
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think my understanding of for-cause, I think it would depend on the degree of what that statement would be.

386
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:36,323
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think for the most part, it would be protected, but I can see the worry.

387
00:45:38,744 --> 00:45:41,606
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor, did you really press your button this time?

388
00:45:41,626 --> 00:45:43,927
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Councilor Calhan.

389
00:45:44,327 --> 00:45:44,767
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

390
00:45:46,652 --> 00:45:48,773
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there other, is this common in commissions?

391
00:45:52,976 --> 00:45:54,416
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Tseng.

392
00:45:55,877 --> 00:45:59,099
[SPEAKER_08]: The clerk might be able to help me refresh my memory on this.

393
00:46:01,981 --> 00:46:04,702
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the mayor usually has power to remove her appointees.

394
00:46:07,944 --> 00:46:10,526
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't actually know the answer to that question, Councilor.

395
00:46:10,606 --> 00:46:10,966
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that

396
00:46:13,554 --> 00:46:22,196
[SPEAKER_07]: if there are, the mayor has the authority to remove her own department heads and things like that, but I don't know what it means for poison commissions.

397
00:46:23,496 --> 00:46:41,719
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we don't, I'll state my opinion anyway, without that information, I do think that the Human Rights Commission is primarily a, well, correct me if I'm wrong, maybe I should look through all of the work that they're going to do, but I think that they really are in a position to speak out

398
00:46:43,323 --> 00:46:50,740
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is one of the primary things that they do is to ensure that the voices of people who are, you know, marginalized or

399
00:46:53,440 --> 00:47:10,553
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, especially in today's world, under the Trump administration, there are a lot of people who are in precarious positions, and to ensure human rights, you know, violations, and to ensure that those people can be heard.

400
00:47:11,014 --> 00:47:17,219
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I'm more reluctant to allow those people, someone with that primary role to be removed.

401
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:33,155
[SPEAKER_03]: that I am for people in a different role where their role is to protect trees or their role is to approve zoning advances or to do other things where they're sort of have a different role aside from speaking.

402
00:47:33,655 --> 00:47:35,537
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm leaning against it.

403
00:47:36,538 --> 00:47:37,739
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of where I'm sitting right now.

404
00:47:42,068 --> 00:47:53,192
[SPEAKER_05]: Quick Google says that a mayor does generally have the power to both, if they have appointed somebody, they have the power to remove them for good cause.

405
00:47:53,212 --> 00:48:01,376
[SPEAKER_05]: So with that being, I think we should maybe add the words for good cause and then have an understanding of what that would mean.

406
00:48:01,916 --> 00:48:06,458
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it would mean expressing an opinion contrary to the opinion of the mayor.

407
00:48:06,878 --> 00:48:08,658
[SPEAKER_05]: This is not about our current mayor.

408
00:48:08,699 --> 00:48:09,499
[SPEAKER_05]: This would be about,

409
00:48:10,350 --> 00:48:12,405
[SPEAKER_05]: any mayor that we would have in the future.

410
00:48:13,015 --> 00:48:20,800
[SPEAKER_05]: So not to assume anything about, it's like a differing opinion, I don't think would be considered good cause.

411
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:24,082
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it would be something egregious, would be a good cause.

412
00:48:25,803 --> 00:48:40,392
[SPEAKER_05]: It does say sometimes it would be with approval of the council, maybe with the rest of the commission's approval, but I don't, I think it would be fine if we added for good cause as part of that language is that in there.

413
00:48:41,977 --> 00:48:43,618
[SPEAKER_05]: For cause it just says for cause.

414
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:50,304
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that is the understanding of that is not a differing opinion.

415
00:48:51,205 --> 00:48:56,950
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know that the way the federal government is operating right now is not really standard.

416
00:48:59,105 --> 00:49:00,646
[SPEAKER_05]: practice in governments.

417
00:49:00,926 --> 00:49:06,510
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's another thing that in my mind, I'm kind of like, we're not really, we're trying to be good.

418
00:49:06,730 --> 00:49:09,151
[SPEAKER_05]: We're trying to do good governance when we're writing these.

419
00:49:09,231 --> 00:49:17,417
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm thinking about like how, how we would interpret this in the future, how somebody else would interpret it in the future, I think.

420
00:49:18,097 --> 00:49:20,979
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we could add the word good.

421
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:23,381
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that, Justin, what are Councilors saying?

422
00:49:23,421 --> 00:49:27,023
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that like a thing that you would, is that standard legal language?

423
00:49:27,806 --> 00:49:32,107
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I don't think it would be that different from for cause make a difference.

424
00:49:32,127 --> 00:49:32,367
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

425
00:49:32,387 --> 00:49:32,507
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

426
00:49:32,547 --> 00:49:32,847
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

427
00:49:33,147 --> 00:49:37,128
[SPEAKER_08]: I think your assessment of the situation is how I kind of remember it as well.

428
00:49:37,148 --> 00:49:44,830
[SPEAKER_08]: Like usually, interestingly enough, huge constitutional question that like, what is very relevant?

429
00:49:45,310 --> 00:49:49,611
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, because it's, you know, or what is cause, but also like, what is removal?

430
00:49:49,791 --> 00:49:51,271
[SPEAKER_08]: Like what is appointment and removal?

431
00:49:51,491 --> 00:49:54,572
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause like, does the power to appoint also include the power to remove?

432
00:49:55,383 --> 00:49:56,664
[SPEAKER_08]: huge constitutional question.

433
00:49:57,284 --> 00:50:00,487
[SPEAKER_08]: Lawyers have been going at it for 150 years.

434
00:50:02,208 --> 00:50:03,289
[SPEAKER_08]: The answer seems to be yes.

435
00:50:04,329 --> 00:50:05,230
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah.

436
00:50:05,270 --> 00:50:15,997
[SPEAKER_05]: I do think that we, yeah, I don't think we can, I think we should allow it in here for the mayor's appointments the same way it applies to

437
00:50:17,852 --> 00:50:23,917
[SPEAKER_05]: City Hall employees, I think it would apply to those appointees to the commission.

438
00:50:24,677 --> 00:50:31,362
[SPEAKER_05]: The same way that the City Council appointees would apply that the City Council would, by a majority vote, probably have permissible authority.

439
00:50:32,283 --> 00:50:34,164
[SPEAKER_08]: I can also quickly look at the case law right now.

440
00:50:34,245 --> 00:50:36,426
[SPEAKER_08]: We can move on to the next point and then come back.

441
00:50:36,706 --> 00:50:38,328
[SPEAKER_06]: So how many other points are there?

442
00:50:40,389 --> 00:50:41,450
[SPEAKER_08]: The other ones are smaller.

443
00:50:44,393 --> 00:50:51,199
[SPEAKER_08]: So, for example, the next one, the next changes in officers in point a just clarifying like.

444
00:50:52,038 --> 00:50:56,121
[SPEAKER_08]: when the elections of officers happen, so annually at the start of a new term.

445
00:50:56,321 --> 00:50:57,141
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

446
00:50:57,862 --> 00:51:03,985
[SPEAKER_06]: How about we take this one up because it does seem kind of important, and then you just go through the rest of them.

447
00:51:04,046 --> 00:51:05,626
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, let's go through the rest of them.

448
00:51:05,947 --> 00:51:08,028
[SPEAKER_06]: In one block.

449
00:51:08,048 --> 00:51:12,651
[SPEAKER_06]: I could see two folks with their hands up.

450
00:51:12,691 --> 00:51:19,335
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just going to quickly say that personally, I'm very in favor of adding that, mainly because I think

451
00:51:19,849 --> 00:51:38,704
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a feeling that where the mayor was coming from is the fact that one person on a committee that she appointed put out a death threat against an elected official, and I feel like in those situations, you would want the ability to withdraw a person that you yourself appointed, and I could sympathize with that particularly.

452
00:51:40,866 --> 00:51:47,171
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just how I'm personally viewing that, but it does depend on the definition of good cause.

453
00:51:47,472 --> 00:51:48,873
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to very quickly go to

454
00:51:49,893 --> 00:51:52,837
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, Munir Germanis on Zoom.

455
00:51:53,097 --> 00:52:03,529
[SPEAKER_06]: I just ask folks to try to keep their comments as brief as possible because we're trying to, yeah, we're trying to, we have two other items for this meeting.

456
00:52:04,130 --> 00:52:05,332
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to ask you to unmute.

457
00:52:07,013 --> 00:52:10,536
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, yeah, Muneer Jamaris, I've already identified my address.

458
00:52:11,096 --> 00:52:23,044
[SPEAKER_00]: So very briefly, at least historically, in the past approximately seven or eight years, there never has been a situation where the mayor or anybody else has removed a member of the HRC.

459
00:52:24,525 --> 00:52:30,950
[SPEAKER_00]: Second, I would just want to make a point that to my understanding, when we say appoint,

460
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:50,917
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally, the approach has been that people who are interested in being members of the HRC would send an application and then, at least in previous ordinances, the mayor would choose some of those folks to be appointed.

461
00:52:51,918 --> 00:52:57,740
[SPEAKER_00]: And the final point is that if there is a good cause, I think

462
00:52:58,356 --> 00:53:03,558
[SPEAKER_00]: the HRC itself can ask for a member to be removed.

463
00:53:04,218 --> 00:53:14,382
[SPEAKER_00]: That's part of the agreement, I think, in this ordinance, referring to other things like missing several meetings or things like that.

464
00:53:15,043 --> 00:53:20,185
[SPEAKER_00]: So to me, I don't think that's necessary, but that's a personal opinion.

465
00:53:20,385 --> 00:53:20,725
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

466
00:53:24,126 --> 00:53:25,767
[SPEAKER_06]: Barry Ingber.

467
00:53:27,249 --> 00:53:28,530
[SPEAKER_06]: Name and address for the record, please.

468
00:53:29,410 --> 00:53:31,031
[SPEAKER_01]: Barry Inger, 9 Draper.

469
00:53:33,373 --> 00:53:49,482
[SPEAKER_01]: When we put together the initial draft for this ordinance, one of the major touchstones, maybe the major touchstone, was the independence of the HRC.

470
00:53:50,082 --> 00:53:54,805
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the key item that we felt needed to be addressed.

471
00:53:56,015 --> 00:54:09,687
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel that the ability of the mayor to remove appointees inserts politics into ongoing activities and compromises the HRC's independence.

472
00:54:10,888 --> 00:54:13,551
[SPEAKER_01]: Good cause is tainted.

473
00:54:14,111 --> 00:54:17,134
[SPEAKER_01]: For instance, just looking at current events,

474
00:54:21,592 --> 00:54:28,335
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, speaking up in favor of Palestinian rights is often portrayed as anti-Semitism.

475
00:54:29,095 --> 00:54:46,883
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine a pressure on whoever a mayor is to remove somebody who has stood up for Palestinian rights and under the guise of removing somebody who's anti-Semitic from the HRC.

476
00:54:47,203 --> 00:54:48,483
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really problematic.

477
00:54:51,543 --> 00:54:53,645
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that we need to avoid that.

478
00:54:53,905 --> 00:55:10,059
[SPEAKER_01]: If a mayor feels that they have made an error and appointed somebody who has done or said something truly egregious, I think that the mayor should be empowered to ask the HRC to remove that person.

479
00:55:10,759 --> 00:55:13,041
[SPEAKER_01]: And the HRC could itself make that decision.

480
00:55:13,622 --> 00:55:14,442
[SPEAKER_01]: The mayor could

481
00:55:16,652 --> 00:55:22,795
[SPEAKER_01]: avoid the embarrassment of somebody who's made death threats against the city councilor by making that request public.

482
00:55:23,315 --> 00:55:28,797
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that that would be perfectly okay, but I think that the HRC's independence needs to be secured.

483
00:55:30,558 --> 00:55:30,898
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

484
00:55:38,165 --> 00:55:47,289
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you, do you think, what do you think of the amendment of a proposition to change it to the mayor may request the HRC?

485
00:55:48,530 --> 00:55:49,630
[SPEAKER_08]: I would be open to that.

486
00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:51,771
[SPEAKER_08]: I did actually think about that before this meeting.

487
00:55:53,452 --> 00:56:01,836
[SPEAKER_08]: I think an alternative path is to say that policy differences or disagreements do not constitute good cause.

488
00:56:07,917 --> 00:56:16,661
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I think that would be awesome.

489
00:56:18,722 --> 00:56:19,243
[SPEAKER_08]: It's difficult.

490
00:56:19,843 --> 00:56:21,204
[SPEAKER_08]: I did actually look at the case law.

491
00:56:21,304 --> 00:56:25,886
[SPEAKER_08]: The case law is that a good cause is broad.

492
00:56:26,766 --> 00:56:33,770
[SPEAKER_08]: It's anything that's not arbitrary and capricious and an abuse of the person's duties or discretion.

493
00:56:34,843 --> 00:56:42,746
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, but it also depends on the context of the, um, the context of the, the thing itself.

494
00:56:42,906 --> 00:56:49,268
[SPEAKER_08]: So, um, like it would in this context depend on like hinge on the fact that this is an HRC ordinance.

495
00:56:49,328 --> 00:57:00,251
[SPEAKER_08]: So if, if the kind of argument is, I think the argument is that, you know, like supporting Palestine is supporting human rights, then there's a case there to be had.

496
00:57:01,032 --> 00:57:01,652
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I,

497
00:57:02,543 --> 00:57:06,547
[SPEAKER_08]: to be quite honest, I think no matter what we do, it will always be gray.

498
00:57:07,468 --> 00:57:16,476
[SPEAKER_08]: I think even if we don't have something like that, I think then the gray area kind of shifts to whether the mayor has the power to remove in the first place.

499
00:57:16,916 --> 00:57:18,618
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's safer not to make the amendment.

500
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:21,881
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Callahan.

501
00:57:22,601 --> 00:57:22,862
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.

502
00:57:22,922 --> 00:57:28,487
[SPEAKER_03]: After hearing from folks, I feel I think even more strongly that I don't

503
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:47,303
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not in favor of the amendment, so I'm perfectly happy if we say that the City Council may request the agency remove any of their own appointees and the mayor may request that the agency remove any of their appointees, but not that they have the ability to do so.

504
00:57:49,363 --> 00:57:49,883
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that a motion?

505
00:57:50,283 --> 00:57:50,423
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

506
00:57:51,224 --> 00:57:51,364
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

507
00:57:51,484 --> 00:57:52,344
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd second that motion.

508
00:57:53,164 --> 00:57:54,104
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

509
00:57:54,944 --> 00:57:58,885
[SPEAKER_06]: The motion from, I actually do feel like, well,

510
00:58:00,762 --> 00:58:05,063
[SPEAKER_06]: we it might be better to take a roll call because I. On this.

511
00:58:06,843 --> 00:58:12,204
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, well, on the on the motion from remove the their own appointees.

512
00:58:12,224 --> 00:58:15,485
[SPEAKER_03]: City Council may request removal of their own appointees.

513
00:58:15,605 --> 00:58:18,305
[SPEAKER_03]: Mayor may request removal of their appointees.

514
00:58:18,505 --> 00:58:18,785
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

515
00:58:19,525 --> 00:58:24,026
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, on the motion from Councilor Callahan, seconded by Councilor Tseng.

516
00:58:24,186 --> 00:58:24,986
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

517
00:58:25,587 --> 00:58:26,427
[SPEAKER_06]: Opposed?

518
00:58:26,827 --> 00:58:27,527
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

519
00:58:28,709 --> 00:58:30,330
[SPEAKER_06]: And thank you.

520
00:58:30,531 --> 00:58:38,497
[SPEAKER_06]: For the rest of them, just please go through them in one list, and then hopefully we can vote as a package.

521
00:58:39,102 --> 00:59:02,548
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so, um, I went through the clerk more clerical thing and a under officers and see under officers, basically just wherever it says assigned to the staff person that Mary suggested adding City Council liaison because right now, she can't find a city staff person to liaise with HRC, the director does not wish to continue the job so this is just to give us more flexibility in case.

522
00:59:03,467 --> 00:59:05,108
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we do need someone to do it.

523
00:59:05,188 --> 00:59:09,131
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe one of us from the city council does it in the meantime.

524
00:59:10,292 --> 00:59:14,315
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, the next thing is under independence resources and council.

525
00:59:16,717 --> 00:59:19,800
[SPEAKER_08]: This is on the third page.

526
00:59:20,580 --> 00:59:23,443
[SPEAKER_03]: The red is stuff that we accepted last time.

527
00:59:29,182 --> 00:59:31,703
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the blue is new edits.

528
00:59:34,144 --> 00:59:48,091
[SPEAKER_08]: So essentially last time we talked about access to council, the mayor was okay with letting them have some independence with regards to accessing council, but as long as it's done through the liaison.

529
00:59:49,511 --> 00:59:51,552
[SPEAKER_08]: So letting the liaison kind of make that final call.

530
00:59:51,952 --> 00:59:55,834
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think she's okay with that.

531
00:59:59,750 --> 01:00:20,916
[SPEAKER_08]: The next substantive change is in D of that section, basically saying that, so instead of the HRC itself submitting the proposed budget to the mayor, having the liaison do it, just to kind of make it the same as other commissions and other departments, it's more of a procedural thing, and it would still be upon the recommendation of HRC.

532
01:00:23,157 --> 01:00:27,578
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the last, okay, there are two more kind of sticking points.

533
01:00:28,604 --> 01:00:41,837
[SPEAKER_08]: The kind of the second to last one is the mayor feels that the HRC should not be able to speak on behalf of the city when it comes to state or federal legislation or state or federal international matters.

534
01:00:43,933 --> 01:00:51,997
[SPEAKER_08]: she's okay if she thinks it's okay if the HRC sends a resolution for us to pass or for her office to sign.

535
01:00:53,077 --> 01:00:55,658
[SPEAKER_08]: And so she's very happy to do it that way.

536
01:00:55,778 --> 01:01:04,882
[SPEAKER_08]: But she's afraid that an unelected body would be making a policy statement on behalf of the city then that then the mayor and the city council would have to kind of

537
01:01:06,543 --> 01:01:13,009
[SPEAKER_08]: kind of simmer down, she's kind of worried that that would impact relationships on Beacon Hill too.

538
01:01:14,910 --> 01:01:27,501
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the last kind of sticking point, oh, and obviously the kind of pushback against that is whether that kind of limits the powers of the HRC from something, especially from something that they currently have, the power that they have.

539
01:01:28,162 --> 01:01:32,966
[SPEAKER_08]: And the last kind of feedback point is just,

540
01:01:35,308 --> 01:01:49,901
[SPEAKER_08]: The original last sentence read that the HRC would evaluate allegations of discrimination and then refer them to NCAT and the AG's office or other appropriate bodies.

541
01:01:51,420 --> 01:01:59,904
[SPEAKER_08]: think the mayor's fear is that that reads a little too legal, like giving them a role in the legal process of like adjudicating disputes and determining which disputes are valid or not.

542
01:02:00,805 --> 01:02:08,209
[SPEAKER_08]: She's not necessarily against them having a certain power like that, but she just doesn't want to create a very explicitly legal role for them.

543
01:02:08,329 --> 01:02:20,535
[SPEAKER_08]: And so she would prefer the broader language that I have put in that document saying that the HRC can review as discretion discrimination allegations brought to its attention and consult with council to review.

544
01:02:23,513 --> 01:02:24,013
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

545
01:02:25,474 --> 01:02:26,435
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Calham.

546
01:02:26,855 --> 01:02:27,095
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.

547
01:02:27,115 --> 01:02:31,998
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I'm in favor of all of them, except I just want to ask a little bit of a clarifying question about the second to last.

548
01:02:33,178 --> 01:02:37,641
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're empowered to advocate for laws, policies and practices that support human rights.

549
01:02:38,201 --> 01:02:42,463
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't quite understand the difference between what they can do now and what she is suggesting.

550
01:02:42,583 --> 01:02:43,684
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you go a little bit more into detail?

551
01:02:43,704 --> 01:02:45,525
[SPEAKER_03]: What can they do now that they can't?

552
01:02:46,265 --> 01:02:54,272
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, right now it's a question mark, because technically the HRC, I think it really depends on how you read the HRC ordinance right now.

553
01:02:54,612 --> 01:02:59,436
[SPEAKER_08]: If you read it super strictly, they don't have any, they wouldn't have any of these powers, period.

554
01:02:59,836 --> 01:03:00,877
[SPEAKER_08]: If you read it broader,

555
01:03:01,818 --> 01:03:05,219
[SPEAKER_08]: then they do have quite flexible powers with regards to this.

556
01:03:05,319 --> 01:03:07,200
[SPEAKER_03]: But the power is to do what exactly?

557
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:19,284
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, to basically pass a resolution saying if the state house is debating a housing stability law and saying the HRC maybe would want to pass a resolution saying we support this bill.

558
01:03:21,085 --> 01:03:26,927
[SPEAKER_03]: So she's saying that they can't pass their own resolution saying the HRC of Medford supports X, Y, or Z.

559
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:32,024
[SPEAKER_08]: she's worried that they would pass a statement saying the city of Medford supports it.

560
01:03:32,444 --> 01:03:32,584
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

561
01:03:32,724 --> 01:03:43,973
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I feel completely comfortable with them saying the Human Rights Commission of Medford supports X, Y, Z. But I don't feel comfortable with them saying the city of Medford supports X, Y, Z. They're not elected body.

562
01:03:44,113 --> 01:03:45,754
[SPEAKER_03]: They already have elected bodies to do that.

563
01:03:46,275 --> 01:03:48,536
[SPEAKER_03]: So to me, this is a very clear thing.

564
01:03:48,576 --> 01:03:54,321
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just want to, like, I would be in support of it saying that.

565
01:03:54,581 --> 01:03:55,922
[SPEAKER_03]: But that isn't what I read here.

566
01:03:57,959 --> 01:03:58,920
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not what it says here.

567
01:03:59,741 --> 01:04:12,635
[SPEAKER_08]: So what the mayor's draft says is that they can't say anything with regards to state or federal bills or things that are happening on those levels, but they can send us a resolution for us to pass.

568
01:04:12,795 --> 01:04:21,738
[SPEAKER_03]: Technically, it does say they shall be empowered to advocate for laws, policies, and practices that support human rights and improve social equity in Medford.

569
01:04:22,578 --> 01:04:33,201
[SPEAKER_03]: But what she is saying is they cannot advocate for laws, policies, practices that support human rights and improve social equity in Massachusetts or the country.

570
01:04:33,221 --> 01:04:34,241
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm sorry.

571
01:04:37,562 --> 01:04:53,129
[SPEAKER_03]: I think to say that the Human Rights Commission cannot come up with their own opinions on human rights outside of our cities is going to rule out probably nine-tenths of everything they want to talk about.

572
01:04:54,850 --> 01:05:05,835
[SPEAKER_03]: In my opinion, if you live in Medford, it doesn't mean you don't have a sister in some other state and a parent in another country or an entire community.

573
01:05:07,437 --> 01:05:08,778
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what human rights are about.

574
01:05:10,219 --> 01:05:20,187
[SPEAKER_03]: So I definitely feel very uncomfortable if they cannot simply advocate for or put their own opinion and say that the Human Rights Commission itself.

575
01:05:20,427 --> 01:05:21,628
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not saying the city does.

576
01:05:21,648 --> 01:05:24,050
[SPEAKER_03]: They're saying the Human Rights Commission is, and that's what they're there to do.

577
01:05:25,511 --> 01:05:29,094
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what I would like for the Human Rights Commission to be able to do.

578
01:05:29,114 --> 01:05:29,754
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's my opinion.

579
01:05:30,315 --> 01:05:31,015
[SPEAKER_08]: I would agree.

580
01:05:31,255 --> 01:05:33,657
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think the best solution is maybe just

581
01:05:35,212 --> 01:05:39,415
[SPEAKER_08]: I honestly this this the idea of submitting resolutions I think is a good idea.

582
01:05:39,435 --> 01:05:45,359
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it should be additive in in addition to what was there before of saying like that broader power.

583
01:05:45,899 --> 01:05:55,246
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the broader power, we can just say that we can create like a stipulation that they speak on behalf of the Medford Human Rights Commission, and not like the city of Medford.

584
01:05:55,826 --> 01:05:57,147
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's Yeah, that's my view on it.

585
01:05:57,867 --> 01:05:58,488
[SPEAKER_08]: Council is our

586
01:05:59,145 --> 01:05:59,485
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

587
01:06:00,065 --> 01:06:00,546
[SPEAKER_05]: I would agree.

588
01:06:00,566 --> 01:06:17,572
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I mean, I would assume it is a clear distinction to say the Medford Human Rights Commission has written this letter in support of a bill that's being proposed at the statehouse or at the federal level that

589
01:06:18,512 --> 01:06:24,515
[SPEAKER_05]: is a bill in support of human rights in some way or, or is against a bill or whatever.

590
01:06:24,535 --> 01:06:32,660
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's absolutely fine for them to write that to sign it, the Medford Human Rights Commission, it has no implication beyond that.

591
01:06:33,460 --> 01:06:37,923
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is one of the purposes of the Medford Human Rights Commission.

592
01:06:38,183 --> 01:06:48,611
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that what it should read as the MHRC shall be empowered to advocate for laws, policies, and practices that support human rights and improve social equity, period.

593
01:06:49,832 --> 01:06:59,579
[SPEAKER_05]: Advocacy should address, I mean, I think you can cut that whole section because they, I mean, the other thing is they, I don't think you even, well, I'm not sure.

594
01:07:00,661 --> 01:07:07,809
[SPEAKER_05]: Genuinely, I'm not sure that you need to say in this document one way or another.

595
01:07:11,417 --> 01:07:16,378
[SPEAKER_05]: what the express allowances and limitations are.

596
01:07:18,278 --> 01:07:33,642
[SPEAKER_05]: But my understanding of a body like this is that you can write a letter in support, just like any individual in a city can write a letter in support of a bill or proposal at a state or federal level in the country you live in.

597
01:07:34,782 --> 01:07:38,563
[SPEAKER_05]: And also that you can advocate for things to be

598
01:07:41,422 --> 01:07:51,184
[SPEAKER_05]: know, there's a lot of work that needs to be done in your city as well, and that the commission has a little bit more authority to do that because they are a specialized group of people with a certain knowledge base.

599
01:07:51,764 --> 01:07:57,266
[SPEAKER_05]: Um so I'm not sure we need to limit their, um Authority there.

600
01:07:58,526 --> 01:08:00,026
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would agree with Councilor Callahan.

601
01:08:02,487 --> 01:08:05,288
[SPEAKER_08]: I think then in that case with this section, my

602
01:08:11,401 --> 01:08:19,024
[SPEAKER_08]: strike the words after improve social equity and then maybe insert the words on behalf of the MHRC or in the name of the MHRC.

603
01:08:21,025 --> 01:08:23,407
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, and yeah, okay.

604
01:08:24,107 --> 01:08:25,669
[SPEAKER_08]: The, I did forget one edit.

605
01:08:25,689 --> 01:08:37,597
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like also a kind of, uh, clerical edit, um, under roles, powers, duties under B and then three at the end of B3 about like employment diversity.

606
01:08:38,138 --> 01:08:44,322
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, the mayor just wants us to put in the words based on data that's collected, like data collected just to clarify.

607
01:08:45,043 --> 01:08:45,123
[SPEAKER_06]: Um,

608
01:08:47,352 --> 01:08:48,653
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, great.

609
01:08:48,753 --> 01:09:02,819
[SPEAKER_06]: So do we have a motion to accept the edits and pass them to the regular meeting?

610
01:09:02,839 --> 01:09:07,942
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion of Councilor Callahan.

611
01:09:08,492 --> 01:09:10,173
[SPEAKER_06]: Seconded by Councilor Tseng.

612
01:09:10,253 --> 01:09:11,094
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

613
01:09:11,114 --> 01:09:11,835
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

614
01:09:12,035 --> 01:09:12,515
[SPEAKER_06]: Opposed?

615
01:09:12,896 --> 01:09:13,796
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

616
01:09:14,457 --> 01:09:16,198
[SPEAKER_06]: Now we're gonna move past this.

617
01:09:16,398 --> 01:09:19,641
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much, everybody, for attending, for all your work on this.

618
01:09:19,701 --> 01:09:23,644
[SPEAKER_06]: This will now go to the regular meeting of the Medford City Council.

619
01:09:23,884 --> 01:09:32,231
[SPEAKER_06]: And I apologize to those folks in the room for the seven o'clock meeting, but we still have two very brief agenda items to get to, which we will do in the next five minutes.

620
01:09:35,351 --> 01:09:39,594
[SPEAKER_06]: Just nobody from the public speak and none of my colleagues speak.

621
01:09:39,694 --> 01:09:41,435
[SPEAKER_06]: And as I say that, Councilor Lazzaro.

622
01:09:42,496 --> 01:09:48,040
[SPEAKER_05]: I had one note about the... Are we on the... We're on the newsletter.

623
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:48,861
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

624
01:09:49,961 --> 01:09:54,444
[SPEAKER_05]: Beautiful newsletter, Chair Leming.

625
01:09:54,645 --> 01:09:54,985
[SPEAKER_05]: But

626
01:09:56,191 --> 01:10:02,797
[SPEAKER_05]: You only mentioned the gender-affirming care portion of the gender-affirming care and reproductive health care ordinance.

627
01:10:02,877 --> 01:10:03,858
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't deep sigh.

628
01:10:04,238 --> 01:10:05,700
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody needs a deep sigh.

629
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:09,243
[SPEAKER_06]: That is entirely my fault, and I apologize.

630
01:10:09,743 --> 01:10:10,243
[SPEAKER_05]: That's okay.

631
01:10:10,764 --> 01:10:11,264
[SPEAKER_06]: One moment.

632
01:10:11,304 --> 01:10:12,005
[SPEAKER_04]: That was my only note.

633
01:10:12,065 --> 01:10:13,586
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise, so beautiful and perfect.

634
01:10:14,767 --> 01:10:19,992
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, sorry.

635
01:10:20,012 --> 01:10:21,853
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to type it in here.

636
01:10:22,214 --> 01:10:23,535
[SPEAKER_06]: Gender-affirming care and

637
01:10:25,767 --> 01:10:34,213
[SPEAKER_06]: gender affirming gender affirming care and reproductive health care.

638
01:10:36,475 --> 01:10:36,635
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

639
01:10:36,735 --> 01:10:38,076
[SPEAKER_06]: Ordinance for a first reading.

640
01:10:38,977 --> 01:10:41,539
[SPEAKER_06]: And is that everything?

641
01:10:42,699 --> 01:10:43,280
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Calderon?

642
01:10:44,046 --> 01:10:44,306
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

643
01:10:44,686 --> 01:10:53,212
[SPEAKER_03]: Um so I would if I were reading this, I would think that Cindy Watson already appeared on 4 29 and she has only been invited on May 5 20.

644
01:10:54,432 --> 01:10:58,175
[SPEAKER_03]: I would just remove the whole section because the meeting is going to happen on 5 20.

645
01:10:58,435 --> 01:11:01,577
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a very good point.

646
01:11:01,877 --> 01:11:02,617
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

647
01:11:02,998 --> 01:11:04,098
[SPEAKER_03]: Aside from that, it's beautiful.

648
01:11:05,899 --> 01:11:06,620
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

649
01:11:07,761 --> 01:11:08,821
[SPEAKER_06]: It saves so much time.

650
01:11:08,901 --> 01:11:10,002
[SPEAKER_06]: It's already formatted.

651
01:11:10,022 --> 01:11:10,803
[SPEAKER_06]: One moment.

652
01:11:11,223 --> 01:11:11,303
[SPEAKER_06]: Um

653
01:11:25,487 --> 01:11:31,108
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, you can just remove the TBD because boom.

654
01:11:31,948 --> 01:11:34,429
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I'll put the YouTube link in there later.

655
01:11:34,449 --> 01:11:34,489
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

656
01:11:35,989 --> 01:11:36,209
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

657
01:11:36,229 --> 01:11:36,369
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

658
01:11:53,892 --> 01:11:59,197
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we have any other corrections, edits, thoughts on the newsletter draft?

659
01:12:00,338 --> 01:12:00,718
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all.

660
01:12:01,439 --> 01:12:03,020
[SPEAKER_06]: Wonderful, do we have a motion on the floor?

661
01:12:04,962 --> 01:12:07,424
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion by Councilor Lazzaro to approve.

662
01:12:07,444 --> 01:12:10,266
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, approve.

663
01:12:10,346 --> 01:12:13,349
[SPEAKER_06]: Second and keep paper in committee.

664
01:12:13,429 --> 01:12:14,530
[SPEAKER_06]: Second by Councilor Calhoun.

665
01:12:14,570 --> 01:12:15,371
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

666
01:12:15,391 --> 01:12:15,811
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

667
01:12:15,831 --> 01:12:16,592
[SPEAKER_06]: Opposed?

668
01:12:16,892 --> 01:12:17,733
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

669
01:12:18,666 --> 01:12:30,974
[SPEAKER_06]: And the final agenda item we're going to hear from Councilor Tseng on the results of the budget survey that we've seen thus far.

670
01:12:31,434 --> 01:12:32,715
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Tseng.

671
01:12:33,195 --> 01:12:33,595
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

672
01:12:34,857 --> 01:12:42,061
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll be briefer about this because I did share the results of the survey with everyone on this committee through the clerk.

673
01:12:42,841 --> 01:12:45,523
[SPEAKER_08]: We got 92 responses, which is a good number.

674
01:12:47,524 --> 01:12:58,289
[SPEAKER_08]: It predictably skews a little bit above the median age of the city, a little bit higher income, but neighborhood-wise, it's pretty balanced.

675
01:13:00,010 --> 01:13:02,391
[SPEAKER_08]: And it does skew

676
01:13:03,672 --> 01:13:12,276
[SPEAKER_08]: towards those without children at home, compared to the census data, if I remember correctly.

677
01:13:13,436 --> 01:13:19,578
[SPEAKER_08]: But with those factors in mind, we do hear quite a lot about a lot of core issues.

678
01:13:21,994 --> 01:13:39,370
[SPEAKER_08]: education and streets being schools and streets being the top two issues that we see kind of throughout the whole the survey, but there is quite a lot of helpful information here, a lot of new ideas about how to leverage state laws, a few kind of worries about

679
01:13:40,451 --> 01:13:54,081
[SPEAKER_08]: shortfalls from federal funding, ideas about climate resilience, about safer streets after school, which is I know an issue we all hear quite a lot about.

680
01:13:56,383 --> 01:14:00,146
[SPEAKER_08]: kind of social programs, family supports, green spaces.

681
01:14:00,586 --> 01:14:06,550
[SPEAKER_08]: So I encourage Councilors to just read through this on their own time as well.

682
01:14:07,851 --> 01:14:15,897
[SPEAKER_08]: With regards to longer term needs, there's a lot of talk about longer term plans for infrastructure, roads, and also a new high school.

683
01:14:19,299 --> 01:14:42,206
[SPEAKER_08]: kind of focus on, there's this focus on how like investing in health and human kind of impact things, climate change, accessibility issues, like especially with regards to language services, immigrant services, stuff like that.

684
01:14:44,307 --> 01:14:46,228
[SPEAKER_08]: And of course, afterschool care, again,

685
01:14:48,618 --> 01:15:04,586
[SPEAKER_08]: In the kind of like first page, which is the meat of the results, I think those are the results that are most helpful for Councilors to kind of just digest individually as well, instead of me giving a summary, because I don't want to treat this like a poll.

686
01:15:05,627 --> 01:15:13,071
[SPEAKER_08]: We did hear that residents are there, there are a good number of residents who are reading the city's newsletter, obviously,

687
01:15:13,741 --> 01:15:17,422
[SPEAKER_08]: those who got this survey are definitely going to be very skewed in favor of that.

688
01:15:18,342 --> 01:15:22,703
[SPEAKER_08]: But to see that over 50 people are reading the newsletter is very helpful to know.

689
01:15:24,203 --> 01:15:36,886
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think all in all, when it comes to participation and updates, like ways to give, to kind of do participation, there's, besides social media and the newsletter, there's kind of an even spread.

690
01:15:36,906 --> 01:15:37,746
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a

691
01:15:40,465 --> 01:15:47,435
[SPEAKER_08]: less preference for attending listening sessions or getting robocalls about the budget.

692
01:15:48,677 --> 01:15:49,398
[SPEAKER_08]: But when it comes to

693
01:15:52,303 --> 01:15:59,146
[SPEAKER_08]: like a town hall with the budget, people are interested in doing a specific town hall with regards to the budget.

694
01:15:59,987 --> 01:16:09,971
[SPEAKER_08]: So I guess, in general, when it comes to general updates, people, the listening sessions, robo-call thing doesn't work as much, or at least with the people that did respond.

695
01:16:10,472 --> 01:16:20,076
[SPEAKER_08]: But with regards to getting people to engage in the process and give feedback, they would like those options open to showing up.

696
01:16:22,809 --> 01:16:31,964
[SPEAKER_08]: There's, there's a lot of great questions that people have in the kind of in that very last section there 28 responses for it.

697
01:16:32,124 --> 01:16:35,790
[SPEAKER_08]: There are some suggestions for, you know, future surveys how to format them.

698
01:16:37,849 --> 01:16:45,272
[SPEAKER_08]: I think some folks have suggested an increase-decrease metric.

699
01:16:45,852 --> 01:17:04,759
[SPEAKER_08]: There's some just general feedback with regards to when in the process we do this survey and how people get information.

700
01:17:05,019 --> 01:17:06,280
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah.

701
01:17:08,708 --> 01:17:08,908
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

702
01:17:10,249 --> 01:17:11,430
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

703
01:17:11,990 --> 01:17:14,492
[SPEAKER_06]: When will we be collecting responses?

704
01:17:15,673 --> 01:17:17,754
[SPEAKER_06]: So is there a deadline out there?

705
01:17:18,755 --> 01:17:23,378
[SPEAKER_08]: So we did put a deadline on the survey or a soft deadline on the survey of this meeting.

706
01:17:24,033 --> 01:17:26,754
[SPEAKER_08]: saying that we were going to be reviewing responses at this meeting.

707
01:17:26,774 --> 01:17:39,558
[SPEAKER_08]: I think my hope is that we continue to keep this forum open and share this link with councillors to so people can see new responses that come in.

708
01:17:41,038 --> 01:17:42,819
[SPEAKER_08]: We all have the kind of spreadsheet here.

709
01:17:42,839 --> 01:17:51,021
[SPEAKER_08]: I would want this just to protect the privacy of those who did answer would want this to be relatively, you know, under control.

710
01:17:52,243 --> 01:18:01,348
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think if we can do more work to engage folks that aren't very much represented or heard in this survey, that'd be good.

711
01:18:01,748 --> 01:18:08,872
[SPEAKER_08]: So I know Councilor Callaghan has helped blast this across tons of different channels.

712
01:18:09,572 --> 01:18:13,214
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we saw better results with that as well.

713
01:18:13,574 --> 01:18:15,555
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think more outreach when it comes to like

714
01:18:16,533 --> 01:18:26,979
[SPEAKER_08]: renters when it comes to lower income folks, people of color, organizations of color, maybe doing more kind of like bringing printed copies to community centers and libraries, too, would be helpful.

715
01:18:27,519 --> 01:18:32,062
[SPEAKER_06]: So do we have a motion to keep the survey open and adjourn?

716
01:18:34,403 --> 01:18:42,908
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if there are any initial reactions from Councilors reading through the reading through this, the results, but Council Lazzaro.

717
01:18:43,895 --> 01:18:46,577
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I would motion to keep.

718
01:18:47,438 --> 01:18:51,081
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep it in committee for now and, um.

719
01:18:54,004 --> 01:18:56,105
[SPEAKER_05]: I would like to kind of percolate on it a little bit more.

720
01:18:56,125 --> 01:19:03,412
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel if we could not close the survey if possible just because there are.

721
01:19:03,432 --> 01:19:05,814
[SPEAKER_05]: There will continue to be

722
01:19:12,712 --> 01:19:15,693
[SPEAKER_05]: Does that defeat the purpose of the survey to keep it open now?

723
01:19:15,753 --> 01:19:16,554
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I don't think so.

724
01:19:16,974 --> 01:19:19,595
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the survey is really just an open feedback form.

725
01:19:20,435 --> 01:19:22,116
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't think it defeats the purpose at all.

726
01:19:22,536 --> 01:19:27,758
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, I guess I might add, I might suggest we add to the motion that

727
01:19:29,808 --> 01:19:38,590
[SPEAKER_08]: I share access with everyone on the council, because right now I have it with members of this committee, but I know the budget discussions are committed to the whole.

728
01:19:38,830 --> 01:19:42,170
[SPEAKER_08]: So just to get other councillors to have access to this data as well.

729
01:19:43,330 --> 01:19:57,853
[SPEAKER_08]: And then in the meantime, maybe I could try to put together a summary of what we see here in some kind of like representative responses.

730
01:19:58,811 --> 01:20:03,097
[SPEAKER_04]: One other question I had is, was it shared on Facebook groups?

731
01:20:04,258 --> 01:20:15,994
[SPEAKER_08]: No, so this was not, well actually I don't, I know I posted to my personal Facebook, but I don't know if it was shared across Facebook groups.

732
01:20:17,267 --> 01:20:24,009
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, there may be an opportunity to get some different feedback if we went that route or asked, um.

733
01:20:25,129 --> 01:20:30,251
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of our state delegation if they would be willing to share it with their mailing lists.

734
01:20:30,511 --> 01:20:34,572
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, um, just some thoughts that occurred to me.

735
01:20:35,012 --> 01:20:41,574
[SPEAKER_05]: We may have a different More broad range of folks that would be interested in replying.

736
01:20:42,314 --> 01:20:42,414
[SPEAKER_05]: Um

737
01:20:43,986 --> 01:20:46,807
[SPEAKER_05]: that would, I think that would be worth looking at.

738
01:20:49,129 --> 01:20:56,652
[SPEAKER_05]: Just as I was reviewing it, especially the household income brackets were pretty high on this one.

739
01:20:56,672 --> 01:21:11,220
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would be interested in seeing if we could capture some of the more folks if we can, before we kind of like, you know, feel like we're really grasping

740
01:21:12,972 --> 01:21:14,513
[SPEAKER_05]: our full range of constituents.

741
01:21:16,975 --> 01:21:22,619
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think this is kind of difficult to just like sit down here and say, you know what people responded.

742
01:21:22,799 --> 01:21:24,800
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it makes sense for people to percolate on it.

743
01:21:27,361 --> 01:21:30,904
[SPEAKER_06]: So is that a motion to keep the survey open?

744
01:21:30,924 --> 01:21:40,810
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, share it with everybody on Council continue to work on distribution and continue to continue to work on distribution.

745
01:21:41,895 --> 01:21:49,960
[SPEAKER_08]: And I guess we could give myself the option of preparing a summary for councillors.

746
01:21:50,621 --> 01:21:52,282
[SPEAKER_06]: And preparing a summary period.

747
01:21:52,622 --> 01:21:55,824
[SPEAKER_06]: To have councillors saying prepare a summary for the council.

748
01:21:58,386 --> 01:21:58,786
[SPEAKER_06]: So moved.

749
01:21:59,207 --> 01:21:59,487
[SPEAKER_06]: Second.

750
01:22:01,048 --> 01:22:01,308
[SPEAKER_06]: Second.

751
01:22:02,149 --> 01:22:02,789
