1
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:04,131
The meeting of the Mefford School Committee will now come to order.

2
00:00:04,151 --> 00:00:05,911
The secretary will call the roll.

3
00:00:08,632 --> 00:00:09,312
Mrs. Cuneo?

4
00:00:10,612 --> 00:00:10,812
Here.

5
00:00:11,292 --> 00:00:12,213
Mrs. DiBenedetto?

6
00:00:12,413 --> 00:00:12,773
Present.

7
00:00:13,233 --> 00:00:13,733
Mrs. Kretz?

8
00:00:13,753 --> 00:00:13,853
Here.

9
00:00:15,033 --> 00:00:15,733
Mrs. Mastoon?

10
00:00:16,694 --> 00:00:16,854
Here.

11
00:00:16,874 --> 00:00:17,294
Mr. Scurry?

12
00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:18,234
Present.

13
00:00:18,654 --> 00:00:19,754
Mrs. Vander Kloot, present.

14
00:00:19,834 --> 00:00:20,314
Mayor Burke?

15
00:00:20,414 --> 00:00:20,755
Present.

16
00:00:20,795 --> 00:00:22,095
Seven present, none absent.

17
00:00:22,235 --> 00:00:23,695
All please rise and salute our flag.

18
00:00:24,655 --> 00:00:31,157
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands,

19
00:00:31,761 --> 00:00:36,625
one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

20
00:00:37,365 --> 00:00:40,287
If everyone could just remain standing, please.

21
00:00:41,068 --> 00:00:50,135
It's the 16th anniversary of 9-11, and if we could take a moment of silence for all those that gave their lives that day and everything that transpired after.

22
00:01:00,925 --> 00:01:01,386
Thank you.

23
00:01:02,126 --> 00:01:05,390
Mayor, point of information regarding 9-11?

24
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:07,272
Point of information, Mr. Skerry.

25
00:01:07,372 --> 00:01:11,176
Bedford High had a great baseball player in the 60s, John Doherty.

26
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:14,740
John went on to star at Boston College and became a stockbroker.

27
00:01:15,881 --> 00:01:17,162
John was a personal friend of mine.

28
00:01:17,182 --> 00:01:18,203
He grew up on Newton Road.

29
00:01:18,884 --> 00:01:21,687
John was on the 92nd floor when the first plane hit.

30
00:01:22,622 --> 00:01:25,923
And as far as we know, he was the only Methodist resident that lost his life on 9-11.

31
00:01:25,963 --> 00:01:30,625
And I would hope that we would all remember him in our prayers in the future.

32
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:31,766
Thank you.

33
00:01:31,866 --> 00:01:32,166
Amen.

34
00:01:34,387 --> 00:01:40,930
Also at this time, if you could remain standing, the Medford School Committee observe a moment of silence on behalf of the victims of Hurricane Harvey and Irma.

35
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:49,153
The Medford School Committee sends its heartfelt thanks to all those who provided shelter and rescue services to people displaced by these extraordinary storms.

36
00:01:58,179 --> 00:01:58,579
Thank you.

37
00:02:05,084 --> 00:02:07,906
The first order of business, approval of the minutes of June 19th, 2017.

38
00:02:08,226 --> 00:02:10,728
Is there a motion for approval?

39
00:02:11,168 --> 00:02:14,190
On a motion for approval, Madam Mayor, I just have a point of inquiry.

40
00:02:14,491 --> 00:02:15,651
Point of inquiry, Mr. Scarry.

41
00:02:15,811 --> 00:02:24,758
The minutes indicated that there was going to be a date set that evening for a subcommittee or a committee of the whole regarding smart brains.

42
00:02:25,649 --> 00:02:27,430
And to date, we have not had a meeting.

43
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:30,670
And I was wondering if the superintendent could tell us when he's going to schedule that meeting.

44
00:02:30,891 --> 00:02:33,331
There's actually an item on the agenda tonight.

45
00:02:33,691 --> 00:02:36,432
Dr. Perrella will be presenting information on smart brains.

46
00:02:36,512 --> 00:02:38,773
And subsequent to that, we can hold a committee meeting.

47
00:02:38,813 --> 00:02:41,674
I understand, but there are some parents that want to express concerns to us.

48
00:02:42,394 --> 00:02:44,554
And unfortunately, they couldn't be here tonight on such short notice.

49
00:02:44,574 --> 00:02:46,715
We certainly can have a committee of the whole after this.

50
00:02:48,284 --> 00:02:49,004
Is there a motion approval?

51
00:02:49,084 --> 00:02:50,345
I have a question, Mayor Byron.

52
00:02:50,565 --> 00:02:50,745
Ms.

53
00:02:50,765 --> 00:02:51,145
Kritz.

54
00:02:52,386 --> 00:03:00,350
I wanted to know, I recall at the last meeting, the budget meeting, the library was going to have extended hours at the high school.

55
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:08,874
I didn't know if they had an update on what time the library was going to open and the time it was going to close this fall season.

56
00:03:09,374 --> 00:03:09,835
Superintendent?

57
00:03:11,495 --> 00:03:12,536
Update on library hours.

58
00:03:14,943 --> 00:03:22,380
The library is going to open, the first couple of weeks is getting everything in order, but we'll probably have the people in place over the next week or so.

59
00:03:23,505 --> 00:03:24,305
Okay, great.

60
00:03:24,805 --> 00:03:29,706
And I had one other item from, it would be considered, I think, old business.

61
00:03:30,267 --> 00:03:38,708
And, you know, I just wanted to bring this up as a matter of concern related to the old business regarding the merger of the high school and the vocational technical high school.

62
00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:43,850
It's concerning to me, some of the students and the parents.

63
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:50,291
I recall from the past discussion in the committee packets that it was very clearly expressed that the vocational

64
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:53,533
high school was going to maintain its own identity.

65
00:03:54,053 --> 00:03:57,075
However, it doesn't seem like that's happening.

66
00:03:58,016 --> 00:04:07,422
Over the first few weeks of school, I've seen some of the recent changes implemented, and they don't identify the vocational high school from the high school counterparts.

67
00:04:07,902 --> 00:04:11,184
The two high schools were merged together, and they're no longer unique.

68
00:04:11,844 --> 00:04:15,767
The vocational programs are made to distinguish the vocational from the high school.

69
00:04:16,227 --> 00:04:20,450
I realize the merger was beneficial to our school system for the financial reasons,

70
00:04:20,827 --> 00:04:23,908
However, the vocational school has lost their identity.

71
00:04:24,449 --> 00:04:32,232
I've heard from discouraged students, parents, you know, they're asking me why the vocational school has been written off, so to speak.

72
00:04:32,692 --> 00:04:35,453
You know, I'm upset, my family is upset.

73
00:04:36,634 --> 00:04:48,079
For example, here's some examples that recently, you know, I found out, you know, currently, and we found out during the parent evening session that there is no longer a vocational

74
00:04:48,903 --> 00:04:49,843
assistant principal.

75
00:04:50,063 --> 00:04:53,644
It's all through the high school, which is a big adjustment for the students.

76
00:04:54,144 --> 00:05:03,306
The guidance council was moved over to the high school office, which is also really difficult for the students to get to and to access their guidance counselor.

77
00:05:04,046 --> 00:05:10,427
You know, my son himself has been going back and forth, back and forth, multiple trips, trying to see if the guidance counselor is in the office.

78
00:05:11,007 --> 00:05:13,388
It's about a five minute walk to and from

79
00:05:13,808 --> 00:05:15,149
to get back to class.

80
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:18,332
That's just an inconvenience, and I understand that.

81
00:05:18,352 --> 00:05:19,973
And maybe the students need to make appointments.

82
00:05:20,033 --> 00:05:22,275
However, the students are confused.

83
00:05:22,816 --> 00:05:23,497
I'm confused.

84
00:05:23,697 --> 00:05:24,678
Parents are confused.

85
00:05:25,565 --> 00:05:36,257
Some of the students don't realize that even though it was explained in the student assembly, their assistant principal is at the high school, they don't really think so.

86
00:05:36,777 --> 00:05:37,898
They don't believe it.

87
00:05:38,239 --> 00:05:40,581
They want to be part of the vocational school.

88
00:05:41,782 --> 00:05:46,608
And then some other things that developed that I found out over the last couple of days is that

89
00:05:48,455 --> 00:05:51,917
The vocational school won't have a class president or vice president.

90
00:05:52,177 --> 00:05:53,237
This is very upsetting.

91
00:05:53,577 --> 00:05:56,559
They will only have a med vocational representative.

92
00:05:57,239 --> 00:05:58,219
It's just very upsetting.

93
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,160
There was a vice president last year.

94
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,381
There was assistant president.

95
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:03,102
There was a valedictorian.

96
00:06:03,462 --> 00:06:04,642
That's all been taken away.

97
00:06:05,102 --> 00:06:08,024
Who will represent the ideas and the needs of the vocational students?

98
00:06:08,444 --> 00:06:14,707
It's difficult for one vocational student to relate all the students' needs and concerns to the high school representative.

99
00:06:15,287 --> 00:06:17,168
I realize it's going to be one school.

100
00:06:17,948 --> 00:06:23,670
but the programs operate very differently, and there needs to be representation from the vocational shop students.

101
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:28,991
A high school student's perspective cannot reflect the vocational student's needs.

102
00:06:29,351 --> 00:06:30,411
They're really different.

103
00:06:30,491 --> 00:06:31,912
Their days are structured differently.

104
00:06:32,252 --> 00:06:35,913
Like my son has one week of shop, one week of academics.

105
00:06:36,273 --> 00:06:43,134
During his week of academics, he has double blocks of academics, two blocks of math, two blocks of English.

106
00:06:43,594 --> 00:06:45,535
He's behind on the testing schedule.

107
00:06:46,655 --> 00:06:48,616
Their timelines are very different.

108
00:06:49,297 --> 00:07:05,745
Another thing I learned today while I was reaching out to get a copy of my son's transcript, and I received a letter along with a copy of my transcript that explained to me that from this point on, they are now under the high school number.

109
00:07:06,185 --> 00:07:11,408
Last year, he had his own number, and it's on the enrollment package in this year's enrollment.

110
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,789
There was 56 students in the class.

111
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:14,930
However,

112
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:24,208
For the transcript, it's now going to be grouped together, which changes the class ranking, and it's really upsetting to the students.

113
00:07:24,908 --> 00:07:26,410
They didn't know this was happening.

114
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:27,691
I didn't know this was happening.

115
00:07:27,731 --> 00:07:30,614
I found this out today.

116
00:07:30,634 --> 00:07:31,394
I was upset.

117
00:07:31,895 --> 00:07:34,998
I know it doesn't matter to me what your class ranking is.

118
00:07:35,078 --> 00:07:36,379
I say do the best you can.

119
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:37,380
You've got good grades.

120
00:07:38,241 --> 00:07:43,765
I'm not all about that, but it was so upsetting that we didn't know this.

121
00:07:44,305 --> 00:07:46,527
I went to the parent evening night last week.

122
00:07:46,907 --> 00:07:47,828
This wasn't brought up.

123
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:49,469
None of these issues were brought up.

124
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:54,794
All of this information is getting trickled down, and the students are finding it out, and they're telling me.

125
00:07:56,715 --> 00:08:02,620
And then here's another issue, is that the SkillsUSA program, that's exclusively for vocational students.

126
00:08:03,741 --> 00:08:05,582
are we going to dissolve the SkillsUSA?

127
00:08:05,602 --> 00:08:07,143
Because that's for the shop students.

128
00:08:08,104 --> 00:08:19,312
So what I wanted to do was make a motion or a resolution to request a full report for our next meeting so we can discuss the updates and ask what the community thinks about all these updates.

129
00:08:19,812 --> 00:08:28,839
And maybe invite some of the vocational students and maybe some representatives from the site council of the high school and some of the administrators from the site council to come.

130
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:43,200
and talk about these updates because I think when we moved to make it one school, I clearly remember in every discussion it was told that the vocational school will have its own identity.

131
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,662
I mean, I remember it.

132
00:08:45,122 --> 00:08:53,408
So well, I just that's all I remember I say that we sure are you sure and that's what my concern was Because I represent the vocational students.

133
00:08:53,468 --> 00:08:53,949
I'm there.

134
00:08:54,409 --> 00:09:00,033
I popped in, you know, just last week to check with everybody Everything's going well with the new vice-principal.

135
00:09:00,053 --> 00:09:07,639
I think it's the students are confused This is a really big adjustment and it's just when we went from last year June and

136
00:09:07,999 --> 00:09:09,000
You're a vocational student.

137
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:12,241
This year, my son is going to graduate with a high school degree.

138
00:09:12,601 --> 00:09:15,283
He loves and he's proud to be a vocational student.

139
00:09:15,863 --> 00:09:16,563
He's shocked.

140
00:09:17,004 --> 00:09:18,404
He is just shocked and upset.

141
00:09:18,444 --> 00:09:21,286
And I wanted him to come tonight, but he didn't want to.

142
00:09:21,886 --> 00:09:25,928
He's actually really busy, and he didn't want to come forward.

143
00:09:25,988 --> 00:09:30,531
But I'm just speaking on his behalf for his friends, and it's upsetting.

144
00:09:31,091 --> 00:09:33,472
I don't want to go on and on much more, but I just had to.

145
00:09:34,192 --> 00:09:36,454
I've been frustrated, and I've been emailing people.

146
00:09:37,374 --> 00:09:39,095
I just had to mention my concerns.

147
00:09:39,255 --> 00:09:39,795
Thank you, Ms.

148
00:09:39,815 --> 00:09:40,316
Kratz.

149
00:09:40,336 --> 00:09:43,037
Mr. Superintendent, could you address some of those concerns, please?

150
00:09:44,978 --> 00:09:50,661
So, we have been talking about a merger of the high school and the vocational school for multiple years.

151
00:09:50,701 --> 00:09:51,722
This is not a new topic.

152
00:09:52,822 --> 00:09:56,584
The fact that it's starting to happen obviously brings about change.

153
00:09:57,505 --> 00:10:01,627
And change is sometimes difficult for everyone to understand what it means.

154
00:10:03,598 --> 00:10:08,522
The vocational school has its own identity by virtue of the fact it's governed by Chapter 74.

155
00:10:09,183 --> 00:10:14,707
And youngsters will get occupational proficiency certificates and other aspects that are purely vocational.

156
00:10:15,908 --> 00:10:20,992
The opportunity for the high school students to explore programs at the vocational school was one of our goals.

157
00:10:21,793 --> 00:10:26,397
The opportunity for vocational students to take advanced courses at the high school was one of our goals.

158
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:32,561
The opportunity to share faculty members was one of our goals, and we've talked about this extensively.

159
00:10:33,182 --> 00:10:43,008
But clearly, change is difficult, and it warrants maybe another meeting, a committee of the whole, to go into it in great depth, to talk about the things you're concerned about.

160
00:10:43,838 --> 00:10:49,743
But clearly, we did talk about merging, and we talked about some of the sharing of activities.

161
00:10:50,223 --> 00:10:54,126
Now, as far as class officers and things of that go, those are things that can be worked out.

162
00:10:54,807 --> 00:11:05,695
But in terms of sharing classes, in terms of sharing programs, having 240 youngsters explore CTE options is something that never could have been done before.

163
00:11:06,396 --> 00:11:06,916
Class rank.

164
00:11:08,017 --> 00:11:08,337
Pardon me?

165
00:11:08,357 --> 00:11:08,898
Class rank.

166
00:11:09,298 --> 00:11:12,360
Class rank, those things are all things that would come together.

167
00:11:13,428 --> 00:11:17,349
Clearly, there's some misunderstandings or perhaps some serious questions.

168
00:11:17,809 --> 00:11:18,890
Now, let's have a committee of the whole.

169
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:21,790
Let's go into it in great depth so that everyone understands.

170
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:25,211
And if there's a modification that has to be made, we'll talk about making it.

171
00:11:25,632 --> 00:11:27,272
The other thing is reporting to the state.

172
00:11:28,272 --> 00:11:36,835
If we have two codes in reporting to the state, we're going to gum up our ability to report to the state in an efficient and effective way.

173
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,400
So we've got to talk it through.

174
00:11:40,001 --> 00:11:43,882
We went down this road because we felt this would give our youngsters greater opportunity.

175
00:11:44,442 --> 00:11:49,183
But obviously, maybe we didn't explain it well enough, or maybe there needs to be more explanation.

176
00:11:49,883 --> 00:11:51,664
And maybe we need to hear from some students and others.

177
00:11:51,704 --> 00:11:56,305
But clearly, this was something that we've talked about extensively for multiple years.

178
00:11:56,785 --> 00:11:57,886
But let's have a committee to hold.

179
00:11:57,926 --> 00:11:59,066
That's probably the best way to do it.

180
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:00,906
Thank you, Mr. Superintendent.

181
00:12:00,926 --> 00:12:01,047
Ms.

182
00:12:01,067 --> 00:12:01,387
Cuneo.

183
00:12:03,762 --> 00:12:07,664
Over the years, that's been something that we've always, as a committee, we've discussed.

184
00:12:08,065 --> 00:12:13,708
That we have a jewel in this city, that we do have a vocational school, and we do have a high school.

185
00:12:14,749 --> 00:12:16,450
The goal was, and as Ms.

186
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:21,553
Kretz has pointed out, the goal was is to give the opportunities to our students.

187
00:12:22,093 --> 00:12:28,763
Whether they go over to the vocational side or our students from the vocational side go over to our high school side.

188
00:12:29,264 --> 00:12:31,607
But as far as the changes that Ms.

189
00:12:31,627 --> 00:12:36,414
Kretz is discussing tonight, I have to say I'm really surprised because with

190
00:12:37,075 --> 00:12:43,764
The changes, we also made it very clear that we understood the codes that need to be changed because of the laws.

191
00:12:44,185 --> 00:12:46,768
But we also knew the uniqueness of this school.

192
00:12:47,369 --> 00:12:55,179
And so listening to all of a sudden the ranking being changed and no valedictorian and things like that.

193
00:12:56,107 --> 00:13:01,671
Those are things that are very, very concerning, not only as parents or school committee members, but take us out of it.

194
00:13:02,112 --> 00:13:02,952
Think of the students.

195
00:13:03,273 --> 00:13:13,320
Think of the students that are, especially students that are juniors and seniors this year, that have been thinking of this their whole entire time that they've been up at the high school or have heard of the high school and what the process is.

196
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:17,403
If we're going to go down an avenue to make, bless you.

197
00:13:18,624 --> 00:13:26,529
If we're going to go down an avenue that takes us that way, this is, as you just mentioned, we are going to have the Committee of the Whole.

198
00:13:26,589 --> 00:13:27,530
I actually second Ms.

199
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:28,370
Cress' motion.

200
00:13:29,491 --> 00:13:30,692
It has to be discussed.

201
00:13:30,752 --> 00:13:34,954
We can't just expect our students to come in in September and all of a sudden everything changed.

202
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:40,898
If we're going to be changing these things, we need to figure out which ones that need to be changed gradually.

203
00:13:42,409 --> 00:13:46,833
Let's grandfather the students that have been pertaining to this, that it pertains to.

204
00:13:47,353 --> 00:13:55,160
If this is something that we're going to change as far as the valedictorian or the grades or our guidance counselor being on the other side of the school.

205
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,721
These are things that need to be discussed.

206
00:13:56,761 --> 00:14:03,706
It can't be discussed or just written in a letter and just sent home or just told on a morning that our students are coming to school.

207
00:14:03,746 --> 00:14:04,627
It's just not fair.

208
00:14:05,888 --> 00:14:07,269
So I am happy that-

209
00:14:09,651 --> 00:14:12,393
We found out a letter was mailed home to the families.

210
00:14:12,954 --> 00:14:27,324
And even when I got the letter and it said that there's going to be a parent evening night for the high school and vocational families, I didn't know that letter meant that my son now has a different assistant.

211
00:14:27,564 --> 00:14:28,465
I had no idea.

212
00:14:28,905 --> 00:14:32,868
In fact, I called my colleague Paulette to say, Paulette, did you know about this?

213
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:34,707
because I was so baffled.

214
00:14:34,747 --> 00:14:35,928
My sister was confused.

215
00:14:36,248 --> 00:14:37,630
I was getting calls from parents.

216
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:38,531
What does this mean?

217
00:14:38,892 --> 00:14:40,453
What happened to the vocational school?

218
00:14:40,513 --> 00:14:42,195
I said, I don't know anything about this.

219
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:53,048
You know, I just want to say again, we've already discussed that we're going to have to have a committee of the whole make it really clear out there to our parents and our students are teachers.

220
00:14:53,568 --> 00:14:55,829
that before, I mean, all this is changing.

221
00:14:55,889 --> 00:14:58,890
We really need to have a discussion, and it has to be an open discussion.

222
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:07,072
There are things that are going on in the school system that, you know, we don't know, that maybe parents are not aware of, so the discussion has to be made.

223
00:15:07,753 --> 00:15:16,255
And I hope that parents, you know, come to the table, and students come to the table, bringing their concerns, and we could really have a discussion on this.

224
00:15:16,335 --> 00:15:20,757
Because again, the whole point of really going forward with this was the fact that

225
00:15:21,617 --> 00:15:34,661
We have a jewel, it is a very different type of situation and thrilled that especially our vocational students have the opportunities because a lot of them are going off to college that have the same type of opportunities and they're not taking night courses and things like that.

226
00:15:35,161 --> 00:15:40,982
But in the same way, we have to be sensitive in making sure that we're not taking everything away from both sides.

227
00:15:41,322 --> 00:15:41,763
Thank you.

228
00:15:42,003 --> 00:15:42,163
Ms.

229
00:15:42,183 --> 00:15:42,623
Van De Kloet.

230
00:15:44,304 --> 00:15:54,323
There is a saying which says that the devil is in the details and I sort of feel like that's part of what our discussion about the vocational school and the

231
00:15:55,230 --> 00:16:15,900
the changes we had this summer, because while I'm having a feeling that perhaps the administration, it was all perfectly clear to them, all of these details, from the school committee perspective, as I had expressed to the superintendent, once I learned of some of the changes, was not clear at all.

232
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,641
For example, I was not clear that all of a sudden,

233
00:16:20,902 --> 00:16:34,216
guidance counselor would no longer sit in that particular office over on their side, or that the kids would not have an assistant principal with them in the course of where those SHOP programs are held.

234
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:43,063
Maybe there's a good rationale behind a lot of the different changes, but quite honestly, I don't understand all of them.

235
00:16:43,403 --> 00:16:50,428
And I think, I mean, as every, my colleagues have said, it's important for us to understand it in order to embrace them or to say, hey, wait a second.

236
00:16:51,325 --> 00:17:11,869
does that really need to be and how do we maintain that identity for the vocational program, which I'll say the vocational program, because it's important that we have that identity held strong so that in the future, not only are they Mighty Mustangs, but they're members of the vocational program.

237
00:17:11,909 --> 00:17:15,469
I think it's possible to be both in a very positive way.

238
00:17:15,809 --> 00:17:17,870
So I look forward to the follow-up on this.

239
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:19,970
I certainly have a lot of questions as well.

240
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:32,481
And when I say that, I don't want to take away from the work that was done by so many in being able to bring some of the walls down, because there was a lot of work, and there are a lot of advantages.

241
00:17:32,901 --> 00:17:44,952
And so we want to go forward being able to take advantage of all those positive things, but also really looking back and saying, wait a second, is that what we thought, and how does that work?

242
00:17:45,793 --> 00:17:46,173
Thank you.

243
00:17:46,213 --> 00:17:46,994
Mr. Benedetto.

244
00:17:47,475 --> 00:17:48,395
Thank you.

245
00:17:49,596 --> 00:17:56,642
So as the superintendent says, you know, change is good and difficult at the same time.

246
00:17:57,963 --> 00:17:59,905
Whenever you're growing, there's growing pains.

247
00:18:00,385 --> 00:18:05,129
But throughout change, what's necessary, and I think what hasn't happened here, is

248
00:18:09,238 --> 00:18:25,765
So I, as a school committee member, am very shocked to hear that there won't be a class valedictorian from the vocational program at graduation, because I pushed very many years ago to make sure that

249
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:39,993
That happened and that they had a presence on the stage and they had a voice at graduation because it wasn't always celebrated as well as it is now at graduation.

250
00:18:40,053 --> 00:18:44,256
And we celebrate both parts of our school together.

251
00:18:46,818 --> 00:18:56,765
So to see that disappear is sad to me, because the programs are very different, and students work and excel in different ways.

252
00:18:57,025 --> 00:19:06,372
And the way we pick valedictorian for one side of our programming might be different than how we pick it from another, and both have equal value.

253
00:19:06,852 --> 00:19:13,136
And those kids need to be celebrated and have that option and that moment to shine.

254
00:19:15,984 --> 00:19:20,949
in the same abilities that every other student is able to.

255
00:19:21,509 --> 00:19:30,357
So class rank, we're having this discussion about another subject with our new computer programming.

256
00:19:30,778 --> 00:19:36,423
And I as a parent really feel like that was important.

257
00:19:36,983 --> 00:19:42,407
when my child was applying for schools, because your class rank matters if you're applying to certain schools.

258
00:19:42,847 --> 00:19:53,835
And having that knowledge or knowing that if I just get that one more AP class or work a little harder in this section and I can meet that, I can be on the table for that school.

259
00:19:54,115 --> 00:19:56,537
So I do think that there's value there as well.

260
00:19:57,158 --> 00:20:01,281
And putting these different programs in one

261
00:20:02,972 --> 00:20:09,355
one bag isn't going to fare well for some of our top students in different sides.

262
00:20:10,215 --> 00:20:17,198
So we really need to look at the details and we need to be better at communicating the little things.

263
00:20:18,338 --> 00:20:27,322
Cause if the school committee members didn't know about these issues, about people changing sides of where they sit and that, um,

264
00:20:28,964 --> 00:20:33,006
So many things important to our juniors and seniors are changing.

265
00:20:33,446 --> 00:20:42,131
And how do we expect our parents to know that, and our students to know that, and to come in and find that out in that manner isn't appropriate.

266
00:20:42,631 --> 00:20:47,274
So I agree, and I thank my colleague for bringing this forward with a strong voice.

267
00:20:47,534 --> 00:20:53,137
And I agree, I second your motion to have a committee meeting and

268
00:20:53,897 --> 00:20:59,522
I invite all of our community to come forward and talk about the future of this merger.

269
00:20:59,942 --> 00:21:00,343
Mayor Burke.

270
00:21:00,963 --> 00:21:01,624
Mr. Scarry.

271
00:21:01,644 --> 00:21:05,087
I too share the concerns of my colleagues.

272
00:21:05,127 --> 00:21:06,328
I have received calls.

273
00:21:07,269 --> 00:21:16,217
There's been a great amount of work put in to merge the two schools and we say drop a lot of curtains and get to the bottom of things.

274
00:21:18,142 --> 00:21:25,508
It's clearly imperative that we do need a committee meeting of the whole, and I would hope that we could schedule one as soon as possible.

275
00:21:26,849 --> 00:21:28,990
On the motion for committee of the whole, offered by Ms.

276
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:29,971
Kretz, seconded by Ms.

277
00:21:30,011 --> 00:21:31,372
Cuno and Mr. Benedetto.

278
00:21:31,432 --> 00:21:32,293
All those in favor?

279
00:21:32,313 --> 00:21:33,173
Aye.

280
00:21:33,233 --> 00:21:33,674
Opposed?

281
00:21:33,694 --> 00:21:34,514
The motion passes.

282
00:21:36,305 --> 00:21:40,206
The minutes approval of the minutes Motion for approval.

283
00:21:40,226 --> 00:21:42,707
Is there a second seconded by miss Punio?

284
00:21:43,607 --> 00:21:44,407
All those in favor.

285
00:21:44,768 --> 00:21:50,409
Aye all those opposed motion passes Approval of payroll approval.

286
00:21:50,469 --> 00:21:56,831
There's an approval by mr. Scary seconded by miss Punio mayor Burke Mr. Benedetto, sorry, I'm

287
00:21:58,957 --> 00:22:00,537
I'll wait until the next section.

288
00:22:00,617 --> 00:22:01,618
Sorry, I was jumping ahead.

289
00:22:01,838 --> 00:22:02,658
Motion for approval.

290
00:22:02,698 --> 00:22:03,438
All those in favor?

291
00:22:03,678 --> 00:22:04,138
Aye.

292
00:22:04,398 --> 00:22:05,018
All those opposed?

293
00:22:05,058 --> 00:22:05,818
Motion passes.

294
00:22:06,639 --> 00:22:07,919
Report of Secretary.

295
00:22:07,939 --> 00:22:08,999
None?

296
00:22:09,819 --> 00:22:10,859
There's none.

297
00:22:10,879 --> 00:22:10,999
None.

298
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:16,420
You didn't do a roll call vote for bills or transfer of funds?

299
00:22:17,121 --> 00:22:19,501
Approval of bills transferred is a roll call vote, please.

300
00:22:20,681 --> 00:22:21,301
Mrs. Cuneo?

301
00:22:21,641 --> 00:22:21,901
Yes.

302
00:22:22,141 --> 00:22:23,022
Mrs. DiBenedetto?

303
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:24,722
I had one question on bills.

304
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,641
in the middle of the roll.

305
00:22:27,661 --> 00:22:29,202
I think I approve.

306
00:22:29,442 --> 00:22:29,902
I approve.

307
00:22:29,942 --> 00:22:33,884
And I'll direct my question to the finance director after the meeting.

308
00:22:33,924 --> 00:22:34,245
OK.

309
00:22:35,025 --> 00:22:36,226
Thank you.

310
00:22:36,946 --> 00:22:37,707
Yes.

311
00:22:38,567 --> 00:22:39,728
Yes.

312
00:22:39,988 --> 00:22:40,248
Yes.

313
00:22:40,448 --> 00:22:40,989
Yes.

314
00:22:41,169 --> 00:22:41,629
Yes.

315
00:22:42,129 --> 00:22:43,050
Yes.

316
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:43,490
Yes.

317
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:45,772
I mean, the affirmative zero on the negative motion passes.

318
00:22:46,352 --> 00:22:47,633
Mr. Benedetto, you had a question?

319
00:22:48,253 --> 00:22:54,997
I just had a question on a legal fee for on page page 23 of what?

320
00:22:55,017 --> 00:22:55,097
No.

321
00:22:57,884 --> 00:22:59,165
Sorry, highlighted it.

322
00:23:00,385 --> 00:23:10,070
On page 17 of 47, payment of $600 to James Collins Esquire for school committee legal expenses.

323
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:20,215
I'm just curious, we have a lawyer on retainer, so I was wondering why we had a separate cost for a different lawyer.

324
00:23:21,556 --> 00:23:21,716
Ms.

325
00:23:21,736 --> 00:23:22,036
Patterson?

326
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:27,536
either to the superintendent or to the finances director.

327
00:23:30,817 --> 00:23:31,337
What page?

328
00:23:31,497 --> 00:23:32,357
I can't hear you, Erin.

329
00:23:32,437 --> 00:23:35,478
Page 17, to James R. Collins, Esquire, $600.

330
00:23:35,618 --> 00:23:38,839
It says the account school committee legal expense.

331
00:23:40,459 --> 00:23:41,239
Oh, OK.

332
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:42,580
Right here.

333
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:44,480
So James R. Collins.

334
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:45,941
Yes, thank you.

335
00:23:46,001 --> 00:23:49,682
Without knowing specifically underneath, this is regarding an arbitration hearing.

336
00:23:50,342 --> 00:23:51,342
So that is a separate fee.

337
00:23:51,982 --> 00:23:52,803
You'll confirm that?

338
00:23:52,823 --> 00:23:53,063
Yes.

339
00:23:54,484 --> 00:23:57,746
OK, thank you.

340
00:23:58,226 --> 00:24:00,948
Should that be under special education then, or?

341
00:24:00,968 --> 00:24:01,008
OK.

342
00:24:01,388 --> 00:24:04,730
It should be under special education.

343
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:05,511
It's legal to.

344
00:24:06,131 --> 00:24:07,052
OK, thank you.

345
00:24:07,132 --> 00:24:07,672
OK.

346
00:24:08,272 --> 00:24:09,513
Approval of payrolls.

347
00:24:09,893 --> 00:24:10,634
Roll call vote.

348
00:24:13,228 --> 00:24:13,848
Mrs. Cuneo?

349
00:24:14,088 --> 00:24:14,308
Yes.

350
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:15,749
Mrs. DiBenedetto?

351
00:24:15,849 --> 00:24:16,149
Yes.

352
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:16,869
Mrs. Kratz?

353
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:17,409
Yes.

354
00:24:17,629 --> 00:24:18,429
Mrs. Stoney?

355
00:24:18,589 --> 00:24:18,910
Yes.

356
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:19,690
Mr. Scurry?

357
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:20,030
Yes.

358
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:20,990
Mrs. Vanderpoot?

359
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:21,330
Yes.

360
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:21,790
Mayor Buerkle?

361
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:22,190
Yes.

362
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:23,651
Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

363
00:24:23,691 --> 00:24:24,371
Motion passes.

364
00:24:24,631 --> 00:24:25,591
Report of secretary?

365
00:24:25,651 --> 00:24:25,972
None.

366
00:24:26,792 --> 00:24:27,612
Report of committees?

367
00:24:28,252 --> 00:24:28,472
None.

368
00:24:30,113 --> 00:24:31,213
Community participation?

369
00:24:33,825 --> 00:24:34,325
None.

370
00:24:34,626 --> 00:24:34,866
Yes.

371
00:24:36,487 --> 00:24:39,629
I think we had a request.

372
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:46,574
I believe we're waiting for our attorney to attend so that we can provide more information.

373
00:24:46,954 --> 00:24:51,097
Would you mind if we just table this item and we'll come back as soon as he enters?

374
00:24:51,497 --> 00:24:51,877
Thank you.

375
00:24:54,299 --> 00:24:55,319
Report of superintendent.

376
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,580
Report on the opening of schools.

377
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:58,241
School year 17-18.

378
00:24:58,382 --> 00:24:59,322
Mr. Superintendent.

379
00:25:00,563 --> 00:25:01,744
Mayor and members of the committee.

380
00:25:03,085 --> 00:25:13,933
So school year 2017 and 2018 officially began on Tuesday, August 29th, for students grades one to 12 and for kindergarten students on Wednesday, September 6th.

381
00:25:14,714 --> 00:25:15,975
And overall, it was a good opening.

382
00:25:16,595 --> 00:25:18,837
As usual, there were a few items that required adjustment.

383
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:25,002
Administration, faculty, staff invested substantial time and expertise to get a positive result.

384
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:32,674
This evening, you'll hear specific reports that document the opening, and additional reports will be forthcoming in the weeks ahead.

385
00:25:33,855 --> 00:25:44,341
As a school committee, you have been very supportive in supporting a number of the programs and budget lines that I'll enumerate right now, talking about some of the improvements that are now involved in the schools.

386
00:25:44,981 --> 00:25:48,143
So significant maintenance and construction around the district was accomplished.

387
00:25:48,923 --> 00:25:52,285
Various individual school projects will continue during the next few months.

388
00:25:53,526 --> 00:25:55,347
The new multimedia studio was completed.

389
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:59,314
Bistro 49 is about a month away from operational completion.

390
00:26:00,015 --> 00:26:04,661
Additional parking has been added to the high school complex, replacing the skateboard park.

391
00:26:05,082 --> 00:26:07,805
And a number of capital fund projects will be advanced this fall.

392
00:26:08,806 --> 00:26:13,853
Class sizes are very good throughout the district, and you have a detailed chart in your materials.

393
00:26:15,102 --> 00:26:18,944
New members of our management team have been hired and have been made an excellent transition.

394
00:26:19,644 --> 00:26:33,671
Major positions include a Vocational Technical Principal Director, an ELL Director, a Brooks Assistant Principal, Director of Fine Arts, McGlynn Middle Assistant Principal, and Director of Technology have all assumed their roles quite seamlessly.

395
00:26:34,671 --> 00:26:37,813
We've hired 62 new personnel this year.

396
00:26:38,213 --> 00:26:44,096
We have a chart attached to this report to fill vacant slots and to enhance our programs.

397
00:26:45,474 --> 00:26:50,879
Our elementary science program has substantial new materials and we're actively piloting a new textbook series.

398
00:26:52,261 --> 00:26:58,507
Each school is receiving a minimum of 50 new Chromebooks with charging cards to enhance our technology utilization.

399
00:26:59,388 --> 00:27:05,074
We've expanded our library staff to support expanded hours at the high school and better access at the K-8 programs.

400
00:27:05,855 --> 00:27:08,157
The middle schools have more foreign language this year.

401
00:27:09,231 --> 00:27:13,915
The additional health teacher at the middle school will ensure that all students have access to the Michigan model.

402
00:27:14,495 --> 00:27:19,579
And a special grant from the Attorney General's funds will enhance our opiate prevention education initiative.

403
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:26,284
A special grant from the Cummings Foundation will support expanded citizenship and community service education.

404
00:27:27,164 --> 00:27:32,508
A grant from the state treasurer will support a new financial literacy initiative entitled Credit for Life.

405
00:27:33,549 --> 00:27:38,393
A global scholars program will be expanded and we will participate in an international symposium.

406
00:27:39,747 --> 00:27:42,630
Our high school vocational school merger is moving forward.

407
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:45,833
We think it benefits students grades nine to 12.

408
00:27:46,673 --> 00:27:50,777
We've just had this discussion, so I'll put that off until we have our committee in the hall.

409
00:27:51,558 --> 00:27:55,942
We have maintained a comprehensive curriculum that offers a full range of courses to students.

410
00:27:56,602 --> 00:28:00,406
Unlike many other school systems, art and music have been enhanced and not cut back.

411
00:28:01,387 --> 00:28:05,771
Once again, we have finished the year with a balanced budget, despite federal and state cutbacks.

412
00:28:06,637 --> 00:28:09,858
We're working collaboratively to increase inclusivity in all our programs.

413
00:28:10,638 --> 00:28:13,058
Our early childhood programs are among the best in the state.

414
00:28:13,578 --> 00:28:16,259
The family network is a wonderful resource to young families.

415
00:28:16,719 --> 00:28:19,220
We have excellent before and after school programs available.

416
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,380
You'll receive some reports on that this evening.

417
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:26,421
Each new year brings some challenges, and this year is no exception.

418
00:28:27,041 --> 00:28:31,042
But I'm confident that we'll meet our challenges and make progress in all areas of our school system.

419
00:28:31,962 --> 00:28:33,963
MCAS 2.0 will be in full force in 2018.

420
00:28:35,611 --> 00:28:43,675
This past year was a trial year, and we will be receiving authorization to release results sometime in October.

421
00:28:44,456 --> 00:28:48,178
A new test using some different formats certainly requires our attention.

422
00:28:48,978 --> 00:28:50,819
Federal and state finance is uncertain.

423
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:57,983
Expanded attempts at privatization and reductions in key line items will require resourceful creativity to meet our needs.

424
00:28:58,484 --> 00:29:01,485
There are already some programs that have felt the cut from Washington.

425
00:29:01,845 --> 00:29:04,427
There are others that are being proposed and being a shift of funds.

426
00:29:05,239 --> 00:29:09,880
A growing number of EL students will require modified programs that are responsive to the needs of those learners.

427
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:19,543
We did move the newcomers program from the Roberts over to the Brooks, but it did also affect us in the transportation line item.

428
00:29:19,843 --> 00:29:21,343
So we need to talk about how those things work.

429
00:29:22,264 --> 00:29:25,564
Expanded demands for technological capacity will require investment.

430
00:29:26,125 --> 00:29:34,747
We're going to file for additional funding to match the E-rate that we've filed in Washington, which will expand our capacity

431
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:37,131
to put on technology.

432
00:29:37,912 --> 00:29:41,935
Spring 2018, we'll see a new coordinated program review of our district by DESE.

433
00:29:41,975 --> 00:29:43,176
It happens every six years.

434
00:29:44,116 --> 00:29:44,717
We'll be ready.

435
00:29:45,357 --> 00:29:49,380
I believe that Kathleen D'Aguilio and her staff are doing a great job putting that together.

436
00:29:50,201 --> 00:29:55,645
Applications for additional capital projects to improve our facilities will require substantial planning and follow through.

437
00:29:56,405 --> 00:30:00,188
On October 5th, we'll have a visit from SBA, School Building Authority,

438
00:30:00,735 --> 00:30:08,496
to go over the SOI that you approved and City Council approved us to submit, and we'll see where we stand with that as possible improvements to this facility.

439
00:30:09,957 --> 00:30:13,537
The review and adoption of several policies align with new laws and regulations.

440
00:30:14,077 --> 00:30:19,438
Every year there's new laws and regulations that come out, and every year we have to think about how we're going to deal with them.

441
00:30:19,738 --> 00:30:25,079
And every year there's some little wrinkle that comes up that requires an adjustment on our part.

442
00:30:26,639 --> 00:30:29,940
The potential transition of key personnel will require planning and recruitment.

443
00:30:30,758 --> 00:30:34,739
Every year there's some transition of key players, just like we talked about earlier in my message.

444
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:40,722
And we need a plan for that so that we can go forward as smoothly as we are right now.

445
00:30:42,042 --> 00:30:48,504
Beyond the above concerns, it is important that we recognize that schools are much more than academic institutions.

446
00:30:49,465 --> 00:30:55,547
The recent Phi Delta cap and poll of the public's attitudes towards public schools made the following statement.

447
00:30:56,485 --> 00:30:58,626
Academic achievement isn't the only mission.

448
00:30:59,446 --> 00:31:04,808
Americans overwhelmingly support investments in career preparation and personal skills.

449
00:31:05,788 --> 00:31:10,770
Medford has consistently advocated for the whole child and youth transition to adulthood.

450
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:12,611
We must continue on that path.

451
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:16,313
Another key concern is media literacy.

452
00:31:16,913 --> 00:31:26,223
We must help our students to develop the media literacy necessary to counteract the hateful ideas, the rhetoric, and the behaviors that are emerging unchallenged in our society.

453
00:31:27,164 --> 00:31:34,793
The late Senator Patrick Moynihan, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, said, you are entitled to your own opinion, but you are not entitled to your own facts.

454
00:31:35,767 --> 00:31:37,787
Opinion has become as true as facts today.

455
00:31:38,528 --> 00:31:41,208
The September edition of the Atlantic Monthly explained it this way.

456
00:31:41,848 --> 00:31:50,270
The internet and competing media outlets allows us to create communities that reinforce our preconceived beliefs with or without evidence.

457
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:58,252
Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel said, the opposite of love is not hate, it is indifference.

458
00:31:58,912 --> 00:32:03,213
Our most important curriculum will always be a curriculum of caring.

459
00:32:04,252 --> 00:32:11,855
As we begin a new school year, we must rededicate ourselves to truth, to love and human development, as well as academic proficiency.

460
00:32:12,455 --> 00:32:13,896
We cannot be indifferent.

461
00:32:14,676 --> 00:32:16,937
Our students and our community need us to stand up.

462
00:32:17,517 --> 00:32:19,318
We need to help each other meet the challenge.

463
00:32:19,898 --> 00:32:21,719
And there's no better time than the present.

464
00:32:22,363 --> 00:32:26,947
to embrace a curriculum of care, and I know we can do it.

465
00:32:26,967 --> 00:32:27,807
Thank you.

466
00:32:28,208 --> 00:32:29,489
Thank you, Mr. Superintendent.

467
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:31,810
Are there any questions?

468
00:32:32,391 --> 00:32:32,531
Ms.

469
00:32:32,571 --> 00:32:32,911
Cuno?

470
00:32:33,292 --> 00:32:33,892
Just a couple.

471
00:32:33,992 --> 00:32:37,635
Actually, to go back on the report that the superintendent just read off,

472
00:32:39,736 --> 00:32:45,698
As my colleague actually mentioned just a little while ago, just to go back real quick on the high school and vocational side.

473
00:32:46,238 --> 00:32:51,960
I do urge that we have the committee of the whole sooner rather than later, because there has been tremendous work done by all.

474
00:32:58,662 --> 00:33:04,765
And I don't want the information that we got out tonight to really impair that.

475
00:33:04,905 --> 00:33:20,792
So instead of having rumors and things going around like wild and rampant, I really do hope that we can have this meeting of a whole as quickly as possible so that way we can work on this and that we can discuss what really is going on and what changes are going to happen.

476
00:33:22,673 --> 00:33:26,715
The other thing is I was just looking at the Andrews Middle School and the McGlynn Middle School.

477
00:33:26,735 --> 00:33:32,659
I know that when we were looking at it, at budget time there was approximately 50 students, more at the Andrews than the McGlynn.

478
00:33:33,159 --> 00:33:37,601
And I thought we were going to try to work something out to maybe even that out a little bit more.

479
00:33:37,721 --> 00:33:40,003
So there could be some clarification on that?

480
00:33:40,343 --> 00:33:41,083
Not this year.

481
00:33:41,563 --> 00:33:46,146
We talked about, and you have something in the back of your folder about an action plan going forward.

482
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:49,475
It's not possible to make that change right now.

483
00:33:49,495 --> 00:33:52,518
So we'll work on that this year and hopefully by next year we'll smooth that out.

484
00:33:53,098 --> 00:33:56,582
If you notice the 7th and 8th grade, fairly close.

485
00:33:57,343 --> 00:34:00,666
The 6th grade is really remarkably different.

486
00:34:01,367 --> 00:34:02,868
It's like 47, 48 students.

487
00:34:03,809 --> 00:34:10,596
And so that's a whole discussion and we've done some work on that and we'll be happy to present on that going forward.

488
00:34:12,796 --> 00:34:16,668
with enrollment, and I don't know if this might be for Diane Caldwell.

489
00:34:17,876 --> 00:34:22,637
For last year, we have last year district enrollment for 9.916 compared to this year.

490
00:34:23,218 --> 00:34:30,980
So the only for the high school vocational last year was 13.65, this year is 13.50, so that makes sense.

491
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:35,821
The Andrews and the McGlynn Middle School were 9.46, now we're 9.38.

492
00:34:36,161 --> 00:34:43,103
The one that I'm just curious if you have any insight is the total for the four elementary last year were 18.92, and this year was 16.08, a difference of 284.

493
00:34:46,444 --> 00:34:53,494
Is that something with our demographics or I don't know if that seems like such a big bump.

494
00:34:56,783 --> 00:34:57,583
The 16th.

495
00:34:57,623 --> 00:34:58,304
The 16th verse.

496
00:34:58,584 --> 00:35:00,945
We have the report on enrollment, item three.

497
00:35:01,285 --> 00:35:02,185
I can't hear anybody.

498
00:35:02,265 --> 00:35:04,306
Item three is our report on enrollment.

499
00:35:04,426 --> 00:35:06,807
Should we hold that in abeyance until we get to that paper?

500
00:35:06,827 --> 00:35:07,647
Oh, sorry.

501
00:35:07,847 --> 00:35:08,188
Sorry.

502
00:35:08,208 --> 00:35:08,708
You got it.

503
00:35:09,188 --> 00:35:11,429
We'll answer that at that point.

504
00:35:11,669 --> 00:35:13,250
Thank you.

505
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:14,610
Is there no other questions?

506
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:16,771
I just have a housekeeping.

507
00:35:17,071 --> 00:35:22,133
I didn't receive, attach the, I received one page of new hires, but not the second page.

508
00:35:22,573 --> 00:35:23,013
So I don't know.

509
00:35:23,033 --> 00:35:24,154
It should be a back to back.

510
00:35:24,874 --> 00:35:25,635
No, it's not.

511
00:35:25,935 --> 00:35:27,896
We'll get it for you.

512
00:35:27,956 --> 00:35:31,018
If you could send those out to us, I'd appreciate it.

513
00:35:31,378 --> 00:35:36,241
And then if we could take up that issue again about the Andrews-McGlynn when we're under enrollment.

514
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:37,302
Very good.

515
00:35:37,342 --> 00:35:40,764
Is there a motion to receive and place this paper on file?

516
00:35:41,044 --> 00:35:41,624
Motion by Ms.

517
00:35:41,824 --> 00:35:42,685
Gary, seconded by Ms.

518
00:35:42,705 --> 00:35:43,185
Van de Kloot.

519
00:35:43,225 --> 00:35:44,025
All those in favor?

520
00:35:44,045 --> 00:35:44,646
Aye.

521
00:35:44,706 --> 00:35:45,386
All those opposed?

522
00:35:45,626 --> 00:35:46,387
Motion passes.

523
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:53,123
Report on Administrative Meetings and New Teacher Induction Week, Mr. Superintendent.

524
00:35:53,143 --> 00:35:56,826
I call upon our Deputy Superintendent, Beverly Nelson, to present this report.

525
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:02,330
Welcome, Ms.

526
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:02,771
Nelson.

527
00:36:03,251 --> 00:36:04,252
Good evening.

528
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:16,677
The week of August 21st to 25th was extremely busy for both administrators and for new teachers.

529
00:36:17,958 --> 00:36:21,161
Everyone was engaged in different meetings and activities.

530
00:36:21,981 --> 00:36:29,928
I'm going to turn this over first to Dr. Riccadeli as she really spearheaded the induction week for us with the new teachers.

531
00:36:34,071 --> 00:36:34,611
Thank you.

532
00:36:35,411 --> 00:36:38,592
Good evening, Madam Mayor and members of the Medford School Committee.

533
00:36:40,413 --> 00:36:45,914
So I am here tonight to report on our induction program that began on August 22nd.

534
00:36:47,375 --> 00:37:01,319
The 2017 New Teacher Induction Program was designed to introduce our newest educators to the district's policies and procedures, to familiarize them with curricular programs and technological applications

535
00:37:01,938 --> 00:37:09,162
And most importantly, to acclimate them to Medford as a caring educational partnership of school, family, and community.

536
00:37:09,603 --> 00:37:11,984
We're hopeful that we achieved that goal.

537
00:37:12,907 --> 00:37:19,173
So this year, we planned a four-day program that began, as I said, on Tuesday, August 22nd.

538
00:37:20,394 --> 00:37:24,999
It really was spearheaded by our mentor coordinator, elementary teacher Donna Lasky.

539
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:32,586
If you remember last year, Jody Lu, who is now the assistant principal at the McGlynn, was the co-coordinator.

540
00:37:32,646 --> 00:37:37,451
So this year, Donna Lasky really spearheaded, and I did help her with it.

541
00:37:39,637 --> 00:37:45,142
A program schedule was sent to the committee, and we thank those of you who were able to attend.

542
00:37:45,862 --> 00:37:51,286
Some minor adjustments were made based on some emerging needs at the last moment.

543
00:37:52,307 --> 00:38:04,557
Workshops were held on a variety of topics that included the use of technology and our technology systems, including School Brains, Google, and TeachPoint, which is our evaluation management system.

544
00:38:05,197 --> 00:38:13,922
New teachers were provided guidance on the educator evaluation tool by Paul DeLeva, Andrews Middle School principal, and myself.

545
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:23,708
A best practices workshop for grades 6 through 12 teachers was facilitated by former Medford Middle School teacher, Maureen Scholar Freeman.

546
00:38:24,448 --> 00:38:31,192
Curricula support workshops for elementary staff provided an introduction to the important journeys and envisions program.

547
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:33,711
for our district literacy and math programs.

548
00:38:34,732 --> 00:38:39,395
Teachers Abby Herman and Reagan O'Donoghue facilitated those workshops.

549
00:38:41,057 --> 00:38:49,563
The induction program also included workshops on professionalism, a workshop on professionalism conducted by Medford High School Headmaster John Perella.

550
00:38:49,883 --> 00:38:54,186
And I will tell you that I think that program got probably the highest review.

551
00:38:54,246 --> 00:38:55,707
So thank you, Dr. Perella.

552
00:38:56,272 --> 00:38:56,653
for that.

553
00:38:58,274 --> 00:39:12,009
We also had a social emotional health session which was facilitated by supervisor of nursing, Tony Vento, and supervisor of health and PE and athletics, Rachel Perry, also well received.

554
00:39:13,138 --> 00:39:25,753
Consistent with our mission of creating a healthy social-emotional learning environment in the classroom, social studies teacher Elisabetta Dineu provided the group with strategies and tools on how to use yoga in the classroom.

555
00:39:26,674 --> 00:39:31,760
At the conclusion of this four-day program, we did ask the new teachers for feedback.

556
00:39:32,526 --> 00:39:36,208
We got a lot of great feedback, most of it very positive.

557
00:39:36,948 --> 00:39:42,671
There were some logistical comments that we know that we can refine for next year, but they were very minor.

558
00:39:42,691 --> 00:39:46,173
So we'll take that feedback and make the program even better for 2018.

559
00:39:46,213 --> 00:39:48,614
I am happy to take any questions if you have any.

560
00:39:49,014 --> 00:39:49,535
Thank you very much.

561
00:40:00,402 --> 00:40:03,445
The new teachers were busy, the administrators were also busy.

562
00:40:03,485 --> 00:40:07,690
We multitask around here and people were going from meeting to meeting.

563
00:40:08,391 --> 00:40:12,355
The administrative meeting started on Monday, the 21st.

564
00:40:13,256 --> 00:40:17,121
And again, most administrators have been working all summer.

565
00:40:17,901 --> 00:40:27,550
doing a variety of things, a lot of hiring goes on, reviewing of the preliminary MCAS test scores, but officially we began with our meetings on the 21st.

566
00:40:28,611 --> 00:40:35,497
We welcomed our new administrators, the superintendent already referred to those individuals, so I will not repeat them again.

567
00:40:36,478 --> 00:40:49,044
We covered many topics that are related to the opening of school and the events that are going to occur this year, such as the Coordinated Program Review and our Professional Development Program.

568
00:40:49,985 --> 00:41:04,392
There were several DESE updates that when we went to the MASS conference this summer, we learned about many new changes and topics like teacher licensure that we shared with the administrators that week.

569
00:41:05,981 --> 00:41:15,463
Administrators also received additional training in the use of ASAP, which is our substitute teacher program that we will continue to use this year.

570
00:41:16,584 --> 00:41:30,307
And again, administrators were provided, we tried to have a balance of informative meetings, but also allow administrators time to open buildings, to get things started, and part of their week was spent, we had time with new teachers as well.

571
00:41:32,227 --> 00:41:35,568
We felt that the week was very useful, there was a lot of

572
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:46,818
effort and planning that went into it for many people, and we thank all of our teachers and administrators who contributed to both the Administrative Week schedule and the New Teacher Induction Program.

573
00:41:47,259 --> 00:41:50,641
I've attached the agenda of the Administrative Week schedule.

574
00:41:51,082 --> 00:42:00,969
I know Bernadette already had sent you the New Teacher Schedule Induction Week, so I didn't want to waste any more paper, so I just had that one attached.

575
00:42:01,330 --> 00:42:02,511
Anyone has any questions?

576
00:42:04,358 --> 00:42:13,704
I just want to say thank you to both people and Mrs. Lasky for organizing the new teacher induction and the administrative meetings.

577
00:42:14,244 --> 00:42:20,929
I had the opportunity to come up to the high school and say hello to the new teachers and of course they all look so young.

578
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:25,192
We always have a great group of them.

579
00:42:25,232 --> 00:42:27,313
We always think going into the summer, well we don't have that many

580
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:30,782
positions to hire, and then alas, it's 45, 50 people.

581
00:42:31,362 --> 00:42:33,104
We also thank WB Mason.

582
00:42:33,144 --> 00:42:37,927
They came forward with some goody bags for the teachers, and they welcomed those as well.

583
00:42:37,947 --> 00:42:44,391
So everybody pitched in, and Diane Caldwell obviously played an important role in planning the administrative week.

584
00:42:44,411 --> 00:42:45,412
I didn't mean to leave her out.

585
00:42:46,488 --> 00:42:46,948
Very good.

586
00:42:47,289 --> 00:42:47,589
Thank you.

587
00:42:47,609 --> 00:42:50,731
Your motion to receive and place this report on file.

588
00:42:50,771 --> 00:42:51,432
So moved by Ms.

589
00:42:51,452 --> 00:42:52,433
Puno, seconded by Ms.

590
00:42:52,453 --> 00:42:52,933
Vandafood.

591
00:42:52,973 --> 00:42:53,734
All those in favor?

592
00:42:53,754 --> 00:42:54,414
Aye.

593
00:42:54,474 --> 00:42:55,135
All those opposed?

594
00:42:55,155 --> 00:42:56,035
The motion passes.

595
00:42:57,156 --> 00:42:59,178
Report on enrollment and class dies.

596
00:42:59,278 --> 00:43:00,139
Mr. Superintendent.

597
00:43:00,179 --> 00:43:05,983
We'll call on Assistant Superintendent Diane Caldwell to present this report and to address the question raised by a member of the staff.

598
00:43:06,764 --> 00:43:07,344
We found it.

599
00:43:07,604 --> 00:43:09,065
It was the missing kindergarten column.

600
00:43:09,646 --> 00:43:10,907
Good evening, everyone.

601
00:43:10,927 --> 00:43:12,388
I think we did resolve the issue.

602
00:43:13,978 --> 00:43:18,300
portion, we didn't have kindergarten numbers because the children weren't in school at that time.

603
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:23,582
And then one other piece of it, we didn't have preschool numbers down either.

604
00:43:23,642 --> 00:43:25,183
So that's where the discrepancy came.

605
00:43:25,863 --> 00:43:26,743
Good evening, everybody.

606
00:43:27,744 --> 00:43:32,566
Please find the attached current enrollment numbers effective September 5th through September 7th, 2017.

607
00:43:32,746 --> 00:43:42,090
It is still early in the school year, and the Parent Information Center continues to be busy with additional registrations.

608
00:43:43,971 --> 00:43:56,515
As you know, the Parent Information Center is right outside my offices, and we continue to have rows of people from different countries coming in, as well as people just moving into our city.

609
00:43:57,575 --> 00:44:01,176
Elementary class size at all grade levels are excellent.

610
00:44:01,776 --> 00:44:08,778
We have provided the Roberts Elementary School with additional classes in grades three and four, and I'd like to thank the school committee for that.

611
00:44:09,925 --> 00:44:19,109
As you know, through the charts, you will notice that the enrollment in grade six at the Andrews is significantly higher than grade six at the McGlynn Middle School.

612
00:44:19,810 --> 00:44:24,552
Due to this number, we have not transferred any additional students to the Andrews.

613
00:44:25,192 --> 00:44:35,017
We are preparing an action plan moving forward to help balance enrollment numbers at the middle schools, and as the superintendent mentioned, we will get you that information.

614
00:44:36,159 --> 00:44:41,803
Medford High School and the vocational school enrollment numbers in grades 9 and 10 are consolidated.

615
00:44:42,604 --> 00:44:42,764
Ms.

616
00:44:42,804 --> 00:44:51,530
Sawyer did say that she would try to make a breakout for me so that I can see actually how many students are in the vocational school for grades 9 and 10.

617
00:44:52,531 --> 00:44:56,454
We will provide you with additional information as the year progresses.

618
00:44:59,815 --> 00:45:02,136
Thank you.

619
00:45:02,176 --> 00:45:02,956
Mr. Benedetto.

620
00:45:03,976 --> 00:45:04,357
Thank you.

621
00:45:04,937 --> 00:45:05,577
Thank you for this.

622
00:45:06,317 --> 00:45:07,358
It really does look great.

623
00:45:07,398 --> 00:45:10,379
Our class sizes are in great shape.

624
00:45:10,579 --> 00:45:16,160
I mean, some of them around 2021, which is the top that we'd like to be at.

625
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:20,762
But overall, throughout the district, it looks

626
00:45:21,342 --> 00:45:23,524
very well attended at each school.

627
00:45:23,984 --> 00:45:32,631
I do see a lot of room at the Columbus school and the class sizes are much lower there and we talked about that a little bit before our meeting.

628
00:45:33,171 --> 00:45:41,117
And how we would like to maybe look at programs that could be moved to that school to add and free up some

629
00:45:41,782 --> 00:45:44,725
some crowding at other schools.

630
00:45:44,845 --> 00:45:57,616
So we want to keep that in mind for this year and maybe we can put some procedures or some implementation of those projects for this school year so that we're up and running with that and whatever.

631
00:45:58,557 --> 00:46:06,924
But the other thing which we're also talking about is, as a side note, on the back of that,

632
00:46:08,565 --> 00:46:16,768
of requested reports and I know some of the reports that were requested last year that weren't finished are not on this list.

633
00:46:17,348 --> 00:46:26,070
So if you need me to look back, Superintendent Belson, and remind you which ones are outstanding, I can do that and email that to you this week.

634
00:46:26,470 --> 00:46:35,873
If not, if you do have it, I'd like to see it on next week's agenda so that way we follow through with any motions or resolutions that were asked for last year and that

635
00:46:36,613 --> 00:46:41,656
The time went past and we didn't have enough time to finish those reports last year.

636
00:46:42,096 --> 00:46:51,222
And one of them, I believe, was how the new development is impacting our moment in our school districts.

637
00:46:52,002 --> 00:46:58,286
We have had a few developments that have recently been opened in more people.

638
00:46:58,946 --> 00:47:05,973
living in those buildings, and we don't know how that's impacting our students or our populations at each school.

639
00:47:06,293 --> 00:47:14,761
And I requested it almost a year ago, might have been after January last year, and I know that that report wasn't forthcoming.

640
00:47:14,781 --> 00:47:19,105
And I'm not saying that it's going to be easy to get those numbers, but I would like to see them.

641
00:47:21,065 --> 00:47:40,154
Moving forward, if there is a lot of development in one district or one area or one elementary school area, do we have to look at maybe redistricting some of the newer buildings brought online to see if they could go to a school less populated and how we want to look at that?

642
00:47:40,454 --> 00:47:50,303
And we want to follow that this year because there are some, a lot of new building going on in the Wellington Circle area, which could affect both the McGlenn and the Roberts.

643
00:47:50,843 --> 00:47:52,064
And those are our schools.

644
00:47:52,525 --> 00:47:54,687
I mean, yeah, the McGlenn and the Roberts.

645
00:47:54,727 --> 00:47:58,590
And those are our schools with the highest population of students, if you look.

646
00:47:58,943 --> 00:48:06,067
They're both over 500 students, our close are over 500 students, and our other two schools have less.

647
00:48:07,007 --> 00:48:21,335
So we just want to look at where people are moving into the city, what places are they moving into, what places are they moving into with young children attending our elementary school, and what are the inappropriate places to be put them in.

648
00:49:07,267 --> 00:49:07,308
it.

649
00:49:16,513 --> 00:49:37,411
So he'll be looking at all of those so you'll have factual information I think and we're gonna be very surprised at how little they have actually impacted our school system But we'll wait to get the numbers to confirm that and that should be for As well as new development that hasn't yet been approved is like where that's gonna happen throughout the city and how that future

650
00:49:37,871 --> 00:49:40,333
those future developments could impact us.

651
00:49:40,653 --> 00:49:46,136
Those having the present numbers will help us know what the prediction is for the next.

652
00:49:46,156 --> 00:49:47,537
They will help us predict for sure.

653
00:49:47,697 --> 00:49:48,118
Thank you.

654
00:49:48,598 --> 00:49:48,958
Thank you.

655
00:49:48,998 --> 00:49:51,940
So there is a motion on the floor to have that report.

656
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:53,981
Second.

657
00:49:54,041 --> 00:50:02,286
On the motion that a report be submitted with the numbers that some of our larger developers have submitted.

658
00:50:02,647 --> 00:50:03,147
All in favor?

659
00:50:03,187 --> 00:50:03,287
Aye.

660
00:50:03,307 --> 00:50:03,707
Opposed?

661
00:50:03,747 --> 00:50:04,408
Motion passes.

662
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:06,009
So it's Trisha.

663
00:50:08,933 --> 00:50:16,918
It's important to understand that every time we move populations to different parts of the city, it impacts transportation.

664
00:50:17,679 --> 00:50:24,503
So that when we did the newcomers program movement from the Roberts to the Brooks, it cost us an extra bus.

665
00:50:25,324 --> 00:50:31,728
So it's tricky, we may have to look at redistricting as a better alternative.

666
00:50:33,957 --> 00:50:40,945
Quite frankly, as the mayor points out, I think when you see the numbers coming out of the new developments, it hasn't really impacted us much at all.

667
00:50:41,986 --> 00:50:44,989
Now, it may in the future, but right now it hasn't.

668
00:50:45,309 --> 00:50:46,651
Mayor Burke?

669
00:50:46,671 --> 00:50:48,212
Mr. Skerry had a point of information.

670
00:50:49,884 --> 00:50:52,626
for both of you.

671
00:50:52,646 --> 00:50:58,871
What is the status of the project on Volker Street, where they indicated they were bringing in 700 rental units?

672
00:50:58,951 --> 00:50:59,952
No, they didn't say 700.

673
00:51:00,092 --> 00:51:01,894
It was 400 and something, but it's in the land court.

674
00:51:02,114 --> 00:51:06,178
Appeals have been filed in the land court.

675
00:51:06,418 --> 00:51:11,162
No decisions have been made by any judge on any of the issues pending there.

676
00:51:13,858 --> 00:51:25,683
Yes, my question, I heard something about there will be an action report, and I think that's in relation to the discrepancy of enrollment between the Andrews and McGlynn, is that correct?

677
00:51:25,783 --> 00:51:26,384
That's correct.

678
00:51:26,604 --> 00:51:28,345
Okay, and when are we to expect that?

679
00:51:29,745 --> 00:51:30,446
It's in your folder.

680
00:51:31,416 --> 00:51:33,057
The report is in the back of our file.

681
00:51:33,377 --> 00:51:33,637
Okay.

682
00:51:34,417 --> 00:51:49,523
And the biggest concern I have right at the moment, I think that there's a long term and a short term, but clearly we heard from some parents of students who did not get their first choice school and were very upset about that.

683
00:51:50,023 --> 00:52:00,647
And I just wanted to make sure that we follow those kids and make sure that their acclimation to the new school is in fact going well and they're not being adversely impacted.

684
00:52:01,163 --> 00:52:03,623
Is there approximately 40 on the wait list, or is it higher?

685
00:52:04,064 --> 00:52:06,144
Well, it's not so much a wait list.

686
00:52:06,304 --> 00:52:09,585
There's a 48, 49 people differential between the schools.

687
00:52:10,205 --> 00:52:12,045
And I think it was 14 on the wait list.

688
00:52:12,285 --> 00:52:12,925
That's it, 14?

689
00:52:13,345 --> 00:52:13,625
Yeah, 14.

690
00:52:13,685 --> 00:52:17,766
But if one goes, then the other 13 legitimately say, how come not me?

691
00:52:18,466 --> 00:52:20,727
So at this point in time, we really can't make any moves.

692
00:52:21,387 --> 00:52:22,487
Talked to a number of people.

693
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:26,348
Some people accept no better than other people.

694
00:52:28,152 --> 00:52:33,036
Excuse me, I read my packet thoroughly and I don't, did you just give us an action report?

695
00:52:33,736 --> 00:52:34,677
It's in there.

696
00:52:34,777 --> 00:52:36,518
It's at the very back of the folder.

697
00:52:37,079 --> 00:52:38,920
Well, maybe it's in someone's, but it's not in mine.

698
00:52:40,001 --> 00:52:43,603
I have the Yoki, I have the purple paper, I have the executive session.

699
00:52:45,104 --> 00:52:46,105
I do not have that paper.

700
00:52:46,185 --> 00:52:46,806
You don't?

701
00:52:47,386 --> 00:52:48,247
No wonder, I don't know.

702
00:52:49,648 --> 00:52:50,048
Thank you.

703
00:52:50,068 --> 00:52:51,288
I still don't have it.

704
00:52:51,308 --> 00:52:51,669
So now I do.

705
00:52:51,709 --> 00:52:56,070
But that means that this is a paper that we received tonight that we have not been able to review yet.

706
00:52:56,850 --> 00:52:56,910
OK.

707
00:53:13,245 --> 00:53:17,466
So maybe perhaps we could put it on the agenda for follow-up at our next meeting.

708
00:53:17,506 --> 00:53:18,627
I don't think it belongs on an agenda.

709
00:53:18,727 --> 00:53:21,547
I think it's, at this point in time, down the road.

710
00:53:23,168 --> 00:53:24,848
No, actually, I think it's quite important.

711
00:53:24,868 --> 00:53:27,509
If we have questions about it, I'd like to put it on the agenda, please.

712
00:53:27,709 --> 00:53:30,170
There's been a lot of discussion about it.

713
00:53:30,210 --> 00:53:39,092
I think the public needs to know, the parents need to know, what are we doing to make changes at the McGlynn, to beef it up so that there's more of a demand for that middle school.

714
00:53:39,612 --> 00:53:41,653
So I think it's very important that we talk about it.

715
00:53:42,313 --> 00:53:43,573
I just have one follow up question.

716
00:53:43,593 --> 00:53:44,574
I didn't get to ask.

717
00:53:44,814 --> 00:53:45,074
I'm sorry.

718
00:53:45,774 --> 00:53:50,256
I just wanted to ask on the report regarding the high school numbers and the vocational numbers.

719
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:19,058
So what I was confused about, because all the discussion I was hearing that the two schools were getting combined, and I wasn't sure why the numbers were separated for the high school and the vocational for grades 11 and 12, but not the freshman and sophomore classes.

720
00:54:21,185 --> 00:54:28,689
So the reason for that was the fact that, remember, there are any number of youngsters exploring over the vocational school right now.

721
00:54:28,709 --> 00:54:31,031
There's over 240 youngsters exploring in grade nine.

722
00:54:33,332 --> 00:54:35,954
For the most flexible years, we're in grades 11 and 12.

723
00:54:36,374 --> 00:54:40,417
A week and B week tends to come in to play for several of the options.

724
00:54:40,457 --> 00:54:41,917
Not all, but several of the options.

725
00:54:42,498 --> 00:54:44,819
So it was an attempt to just simply consolidate numbers.

726
00:54:44,859 --> 00:54:46,800
But we can get a breakout for you.

727
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:46,860
OK.

728
00:54:50,153 --> 00:54:50,713
Thank you.

729
00:54:51,153 --> 00:54:54,394
All motions to receive in place on file, the report on enrollment numbers.

730
00:54:54,414 --> 00:54:56,614
Motion for approval.

731
00:54:56,654 --> 00:54:57,014
Second.

732
00:54:57,454 --> 00:54:58,094
Seconded by Ms.

733
00:54:58,114 --> 00:54:58,554
Vanderclute.

734
00:54:58,594 --> 00:54:59,315
All those in favor?

735
00:54:59,635 --> 00:54:59,735
Aye.

736
00:54:59,955 --> 00:55:00,515
All those opposed?

737
00:55:00,555 --> 00:55:01,235
Motion passes.

738
00:55:01,995 --> 00:55:04,015
Report on building and grounds projects.

739
00:55:05,036 --> 00:55:10,737
Mr. McLaughlin is here to give us a report of what has been done and what more is going to be done.

740
00:55:11,357 --> 00:55:16,638
As I indicated earlier, the SOI is being reviewed by SBA on October 5th.

741
00:55:17,378 --> 00:55:19,118
So a lot's going to happen.

742
00:55:20,042 --> 00:55:21,543
Here's an update as we stand right now.

743
00:55:22,403 --> 00:55:24,805
Good evening, Mayor Burke, Superintendent Belson's committee.

744
00:55:25,765 --> 00:55:33,089
So, as I said in the report, I was very pleased with the amount of projects that we were able to tackle in the short window.

745
00:55:34,770 --> 00:55:37,191
As always, the maintenance continues.

746
00:55:37,211 --> 00:55:39,593
There's always room for more.

747
00:55:41,013 --> 00:55:47,117
As long as the budget can handle it, we'll be happy to take care of it.

748
00:55:48,958 --> 00:55:59,042
And I just want to give a quick thanks to our friends at the DPW and the Park Department, as well as today we need the Water Department to help us out for a few minutes.

749
00:55:59,542 --> 00:56:00,742
They're always there for us.

750
00:56:01,142 --> 00:56:03,983
But if there's any questions I can answer, I'd be happy to.

751
00:56:05,264 --> 00:56:07,365
Could you just highlight some of the projects you did this summer?

752
00:56:07,385 --> 00:56:07,565
Sure.

753
00:56:07,585 --> 00:56:09,705
Because you got quite a bit completed.

754
00:56:10,126 --> 00:56:16,008
So at the high school here, we did some Jersey barrier work out in the exterior.

755
00:56:17,487 --> 00:56:21,249
of the fence area, as well as up in the back by Edgeley Field.

756
00:56:22,910 --> 00:56:27,052
We had some ceiling issues in the theater that we had fixed.

757
00:56:28,553 --> 00:56:33,196
Door 31, where the pool entrance is, we did some extensive work out there.

758
00:56:35,597 --> 00:56:35,797
Ms.

759
00:56:35,817 --> 00:56:44,442
Mustone was very active, and actually Mayor Burke as well, in spearheading some of those improvements out there.

760
00:56:45,650 --> 00:56:50,333
And we were up in the community schools area trying to bring that back a little bit.

761
00:56:51,013 --> 00:56:59,338
We realized that on the weekends, a lot of people traverse the back of the building, and in a lot of cases, more than the front.

762
00:56:59,918 --> 00:57:07,263
So we're really concentrating up back, trying to really make that area look very good.

763
00:57:07,283 --> 00:57:10,544
The kids' corner, we did a lot of work over there.

764
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:16,426
both rooms over there and we installed air conditioners for the youngsters.

765
00:57:18,306 --> 00:57:19,327
Yeah, that was Erin.

766
00:57:19,647 --> 00:57:20,687
No, I have a question.

767
00:57:21,667 --> 00:57:25,308
You were one of the ones that was very concerned.

768
00:57:29,249 --> 00:57:38,231
There was a question whether the doors could be looked at because some of them don't close very well in the kid's corner as well as check the bathroom.

769
00:57:38,271 --> 00:57:40,271
Some of them need some updating.

770
00:57:41,129 --> 00:57:52,529
We did have the bathrooms, it is part of our plan, it's just that unfortunately we started to run out of time at the end, so we were just trying to touch up other areas.

771
00:57:55,359 --> 00:57:57,200
During the break, Christmas break, maybe?

772
00:57:57,220 --> 00:58:00,821
I mean, we'll go over there and we'll take a look and see what we can do in the now.

773
00:58:01,401 --> 00:58:11,765
But anything that needs to take more than a few days, we'll handle it during the... Just especially the doors, with closing them with the little fingers, you know?

774
00:58:11,945 --> 00:58:13,245
Just want to be careful of that.

775
00:58:13,345 --> 00:58:17,447
So I don't know if they swell up or anything, or what the situation is.

776
00:58:17,918 --> 00:58:18,878
but if you could look at that.

777
00:58:18,959 --> 00:58:20,399
Absolutely, we'll take a look at it.

778
00:58:20,639 --> 00:58:23,181
I'm in touch with Linda a lot.

779
00:58:24,641 --> 00:58:25,962
She's on it, she's good.

780
00:58:28,843 --> 00:58:30,524
So moving on.

781
00:58:34,746 --> 00:58:45,912
So we did some work in the Parent Information Center where we made another office for ELL so that they could run their program a little bit more efficiently.

782
00:58:48,738 --> 00:58:54,266
In the other schools at Columbus, we did some painting with the DOC.

783
00:58:56,396 --> 00:59:04,579
We did some work in the tot lots as well as we did some planting because there is some erosion within a butter.

784
00:59:04,839 --> 00:59:09,621
So they were very concerned about the land eroding around their fence.

785
00:59:09,681 --> 00:59:16,544
So we went in there and we planted some flower, some invasive species to kind of hold it together.

786
00:59:16,950 --> 00:59:27,615
Hopefully that works out, if it doesn't then we'll maybe have to put a retaining wall up next year or something to really kind of, but the landscaper suggested that we start there.

787
00:59:29,957 --> 00:59:36,020
In the Andrews, we did some work with, we had to put a new backboard in because it broke.

788
00:59:37,508 --> 00:59:50,580
And we also did some painting, and Wegmans was gracious enough to volunteer some of their help to come in and paint the main stairwell over there, which was very nice of them.

789
00:59:51,260 --> 00:59:53,842
We're in the process right now of ordering a scrubbing machine.

790
00:59:53,882 --> 01:00:03,571
They haven't had one over there for quite a while, so they can more efficiently clean their corridors and their common areas as well.

791
01:00:06,361 --> 01:00:07,562
Let's see, highlights.

792
01:00:07,602 --> 01:00:14,586
We did it, we were able to get another classroom at the Curtis Tufts done where we stripped off the varnish.

793
01:00:15,387 --> 01:00:18,209
So that was really good.

794
01:00:18,229 --> 01:00:20,771
So hopefully we can keep moving in the right direction down there.

795
01:00:21,571 --> 01:00:28,196
You know, from last year where we did a lot of work and with the lighting and everything and the painting.

796
01:00:28,216 --> 01:00:33,339
And I mean, there's many more.

797
01:00:33,379 --> 01:00:34,560
I could take up the whole night

798
01:00:35,227 --> 01:00:35,827
Thank you, John.

799
01:00:36,247 --> 01:00:40,989
Could you just get the power washing out for the signs to each of the schools?

800
01:00:41,269 --> 01:00:58,814
Yeah, we're going to, and I spoke with the superintendent about it, and that's one of our goals, is we want to look into getting some power washing done of Method High School, especially the exterior, as well as some signs at the entrances of the different schools as well, yes.

801
01:00:59,394 --> 01:01:00,754
Thank you, John.

802
01:01:00,794 --> 01:01:01,995
That's going to be one of our

803
01:01:05,530 --> 01:01:05,951
Thank you.

804
01:01:05,971 --> 01:01:07,312
Mr. Skerry.

805
01:01:08,452 --> 01:01:12,455
Just a tip of the hat to you, John, and your staff at the Curtis Tops.

806
01:01:12,475 --> 01:01:17,759
That could be our gem of all gems that is hidden.

807
01:01:17,859 --> 01:01:21,581
It's been many years since anything substantial has been done.

808
01:01:21,881 --> 01:01:27,705
But obviously in the last eight to 12 months, I've seen a complete 180 there.

809
01:01:27,805 --> 01:01:30,107
And it was great to walk through and see the floors.

810
01:01:30,643 --> 01:01:35,386
as they were when the school was probably first built in the 30s.

811
01:01:35,966 --> 01:01:41,210
Yeah, I was very happy that we were able to figure out a way to bring those floors back.

812
01:01:41,350 --> 01:01:42,730
They look fantastic.

813
01:01:42,750 --> 01:01:43,611
Yeah, they do.

814
01:01:43,691 --> 01:01:44,171
Thank you.

815
01:01:44,331 --> 01:01:44,852
They really do.

816
01:01:48,157 --> 01:01:54,386
John, in your report, you attached information from an inspection from the plaster in this auditorium.

817
01:01:55,247 --> 01:01:58,692
And it's difficult for us to see because the lights are in our eyes.

818
01:01:59,693 --> 01:02:02,457
I noted that you said that we made ceiling repairs.

819
01:02:02,517 --> 01:02:04,139
So are the ceiling repairs consistent?

820
01:02:04,939 --> 01:02:11,383
with the recommendations in the report, and did we have our guys do that, or did we have professionals come in?

821
01:02:11,423 --> 01:02:15,826
No, we had a professional plasterer come in, and that's good that you don't see the repairs.

822
01:02:15,866 --> 01:02:17,307
That's what it's all about, I guess.

823
01:02:18,688 --> 01:02:19,708
We can't tell anything.

824
01:02:19,808 --> 01:02:23,851
Right above us, actually.

825
01:02:24,611 --> 01:02:26,032
Right where I'm standing.

826
01:02:26,252 --> 01:02:27,153
Right where I'm standing.

827
01:02:27,373 --> 01:02:30,435
So all of those were taken care of?

828
01:02:30,535 --> 01:02:38,362
Yes, we were very, we worked with the building department, the superintendent was very, we were very concerned making sure.

829
01:02:38,642 --> 01:02:43,866
We had a structural engineer come in to make sure everything was okay and they gave us a report.

830
01:02:44,006 --> 01:02:54,414
And I guess the key part of that is besides the repair work, it sounded like any issues that allowed water in that might have caused this are taken care of.

831
01:02:55,406 --> 01:03:20,121
Yes, right now we had an infrared scan on top over here, and we brought out the infrared scan, we went up there with the plasters, we went up there to walk around, and there isn't really any water getting up there, and I'm thinking that it was something that happened a long, long time ago, and it just kind of started to work its way out on its own.

832
01:03:21,197 --> 01:03:25,606
And it was just separating from the lab that's up above it.

833
01:03:26,288 --> 01:03:29,715
And it's just one of those things.

834
01:03:29,755 --> 01:03:31,439
We'll obviously keep our eye on it.

835
01:03:32,497 --> 01:03:35,738
But it's just one of those things that happens in a building.

836
01:03:35,758 --> 01:03:37,359
So all the rest of the areas were tested?

837
01:03:37,499 --> 01:03:44,241
Yes, and there was some other little spots that they were able to go up and touch them up.

838
01:03:44,481 --> 01:03:45,122
Okay, thank you.

839
01:03:46,162 --> 01:03:48,923
Mr. Scarron, you're all set.

840
01:03:48,963 --> 01:03:49,123
Ms.

841
01:03:49,503 --> 01:03:50,103
DiBenedetto.

842
01:03:50,163 --> 01:03:50,543
Thank you.

843
01:03:50,884 --> 01:03:51,204
And then Ms.

844
01:03:51,264 --> 01:03:51,664
Cuno.

845
01:03:51,944 --> 01:03:54,545
So, sorry I jumped in too early before, but

846
01:03:55,385 --> 01:04:00,130
Since we're having power washers, are we going to be washing the windows at some of the buildings?

847
01:04:00,270 --> 01:04:10,720
I know it's very difficult to get to the exterior, and you need specialized equipment, especially like the Andrews and the McGlynn, and how you get back to the top.

848
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:13,523
But it makes a tremendous difference.

849
01:04:14,103 --> 01:04:19,128
And if we haven't done it in a very long time, I know it's extremely expensive, but I really feel like

850
01:04:20,675 --> 01:04:34,022
it makes a tremendous impact, similar to the shades at... Well, some of the power washing, I'm assuming, you know, ground level stuff, more than likely we'll be able to handle on our own.

851
01:04:34,502 --> 01:04:43,627
But obviously, we're gonna have to have some kind of, especially at Medford High School, we're gonna have to have a company come in with lifts and staging and just to get up and do it.

852
01:04:44,207 --> 01:04:46,349
And I'm assuming that they would,

853
01:04:47,275 --> 01:04:51,318
you know, we would obviously get the windows, I mean, that would be the time to do it.

854
01:04:51,358 --> 01:05:00,324
And the same at the other schools when we decide just exactly what we're looking to do as far as power washing goes, you know?

855
01:05:00,364 --> 01:05:01,685
So I, yeah.

856
01:05:02,005 --> 01:05:02,926
Please keep it in mind.

857
01:05:03,066 --> 01:05:11,231
It's something I could definitely research too, because they do have, excuse me, they do have equipment out there for window washing that can go up really high.

858
01:05:12,352 --> 01:05:14,234
I was looking at it a year or two ago.

859
01:05:14,254 --> 01:05:15,955
I didn't think it was the right time.

860
01:05:16,577 --> 01:05:17,589
But it could be now.

861
01:05:18,645 --> 01:05:19,045
Very good.

862
01:05:19,405 --> 01:05:19,586
Ms.

863
01:05:19,606 --> 01:05:26,490
Cuno, I apologize if any of my colleagues have already said this, but it's kind of hard to hear a few things.

864
01:05:27,070 --> 01:05:29,151
I know that the discussion came up with bathrooms.

865
01:05:30,692 --> 01:05:36,496
And I'm not sure which schools we were talking about or if we were discussing- That was the kids' corner bathroom.

866
01:05:36,536 --> 01:05:46,882
They were discussing that they wanted some touch up or we may replace the toilets and do a little bit of on the walls over there.

867
01:05:47,983 --> 01:05:53,287
Well, I know in the past couple of years we've actually concentrated on the elementary schools, the middle schools.

868
01:05:53,907 --> 01:05:59,052
I'm not 100% sure if we've done anything really big in the high school bathrooms.

869
01:06:00,273 --> 01:06:08,299
A few years ago we did some, believe it or not, especially petition-wise at the high school.

870
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:12,282
Quite a while ago we did C-Build on one side.

871
01:06:12,302 --> 01:06:15,565
We replaced all the bathrooms' petitions with plastic.

872
01:06:17,795 --> 01:06:22,056
The construction of the bartering petitions at the high school, they're like iron.

873
01:06:22,836 --> 01:06:27,377
You can't, you really, you can't, I mean it's hard to destroy them.

874
01:06:27,897 --> 01:06:46,400
So we're in good shape, but in the report where I talk about we're interviewing for the carpenter position, now's the time that I really would like to look at the elementary schools, because there are petitions at the elementary schools that are in need of replacement.

875
01:06:47,937 --> 01:06:58,384
if we, now that we're building up our forces in the company department, it could be a job they could do, instead of having to keep subbing out jobs all the time that are expensive.

876
01:06:58,584 --> 01:07:07,290
So it's definitely, that's definitely on the radar, it's a big thing, it's definitely on the radar, especially all the elementary schools.

877
01:07:08,345 --> 01:07:10,027
And we're going to get there soon.

878
01:07:11,749 --> 01:07:12,470
I'm sorry, John.

879
01:07:12,510 --> 01:07:15,473
Again, I don't know if it's the microphones, the speakers in here.

880
01:07:15,493 --> 01:07:16,554
It sounds loud out here.

881
01:07:16,574 --> 01:07:18,496
It's really difficult.

882
01:07:18,536 --> 01:07:19,297
It's very muffled.

883
01:07:20,018 --> 01:07:26,324
I just want to know, as far as the high school ones, because I know that when we've taken our walks and our tours in all the schools,

884
01:07:26,885 --> 01:07:29,986
You know, we've looked at everything, but I'm not 100% sure.

885
01:07:30,026 --> 01:07:34,108
I mean, as far as I know, the bathrooms in the high school, I wasn't really sure if we've updated them.

886
01:07:34,148 --> 01:07:38,170
I know we've cleaned them and we've painted them, but I mean, is there a plan out there?

887
01:07:38,210 --> 01:07:40,931
Is there something out there that we could really look at the high school ones?

888
01:07:40,951 --> 01:07:45,513
Because I know those have been the ones that have been kind of in the wayside for a while.

889
01:07:45,893 --> 01:07:46,713
Thank you.

890
01:07:46,773 --> 01:07:48,714
So let me answer some of that a little bit.

891
01:07:49,374 --> 01:07:53,116
As I told you, we have the SOI coming in on October 5th.

892
01:07:53,156 --> 01:07:55,497
If we're going to get state money,

893
01:07:56,632 --> 01:08:03,175
That's where we're going to do it with, because I want 56% on the dollar back if I can get it.

894
01:08:03,855 --> 01:08:04,916
So we'll look at that.

895
01:08:04,936 --> 01:08:05,896
That'll be part of that.

896
01:08:06,457 --> 01:08:08,658
If that's not possible, that becomes an object.

897
01:08:08,678 --> 01:08:13,260
There's a number of other projects that we would hope to get state money for if they approve it.

898
01:08:14,740 --> 01:08:15,020
Thanks.

899
01:08:15,661 --> 01:08:16,101
Thank you.

900
01:08:16,881 --> 01:08:17,682
Is there a motion?

901
01:08:17,962 --> 01:08:18,402
Are you all set?

902
01:08:18,582 --> 01:08:19,943
I have one question.

903
01:08:20,463 --> 01:08:22,544
I got to stop by the Bistro last week.

904
01:08:23,054 --> 01:08:23,835
and it's coming along.

905
01:08:23,855 --> 01:08:24,676
It looks really great.

906
01:08:24,736 --> 01:08:25,877
The furniture was delivered.

907
01:08:25,917 --> 01:08:28,439
It's all, it was all packaged, so they hadn't opened it yet.

908
01:08:28,499 --> 01:08:34,684
And I got to talk to some of the students and they're all, they're so very proud that they're helping, you know, build the bistro.

909
01:08:34,784 --> 01:08:42,131
And, um, I just wanted to know, um, was there like a plan for an opening date or, um, what's the timeline for completion?

910
01:08:42,871 --> 01:08:45,053
It looked really close to almost being done.

911
01:08:45,734 --> 01:08:46,114
Yeah.

912
01:08:46,514 --> 01:08:47,195
Yeah.

913
01:08:47,355 --> 01:08:48,196
So the restaurant,

914
01:08:51,218 --> 01:08:53,199
Obviously, it needs a little bit more work.

915
01:08:54,079 --> 01:08:57,540
It was an ambitious timetable.

916
01:08:58,521 --> 01:09:01,102
No one will ever accuse Heidi of being anything less than ambitious.

917
01:09:02,682 --> 01:09:07,264
And I think that we need a little bit more time to do it right, to finish off some things.

918
01:09:07,324 --> 01:09:09,925
Equipment has to be hooked up a certain way.

919
01:09:10,905 --> 01:09:19,909
And then there needs to be some training time for the people who are going to be using the materials so that we don't just simply say we open up today that we can put everything on.

920
01:09:21,243 --> 01:09:24,705
We suspect in early October that we'll be able to do something with it.

921
01:09:24,725 --> 01:09:26,606
It'll definitely have a grand opening at that time.

922
01:09:26,626 --> 01:09:26,826
Great.

923
01:09:27,566 --> 01:09:35,630
And I believe also at this particular point, just for an overall update on the kitchen over there, is we're waiting for Kitteridge.

924
01:09:36,051 --> 01:09:39,092
They're the installation company that's installing all the equipment.

925
01:09:39,552 --> 01:09:44,195
So as soon as they can get in and get it all installed, then everybody can make the push.

926
01:09:44,835 --> 01:09:48,621
to get the lighting and get everything together.

927
01:09:48,661 --> 01:09:58,855
But as the superintendent said, the kids will need some time, obviously, to train, come up there and get affiliated with all the new equipment.

928
01:09:58,975 --> 01:10:00,056
But it's moving good.

929
01:10:01,515 --> 01:10:04,117
I'm in touch with Heidi just about every day, five times a day.

930
01:10:05,117 --> 01:10:06,758
I saw her, she was here last week.

931
01:10:07,238 --> 01:10:17,003
Yeah, she was up here last week and there's a few trades doing a few things, but I think we're at the end as far as the last push.

932
01:10:17,873 --> 01:10:18,313
Very good.

933
01:10:18,673 --> 01:10:19,554
Thank you very much.

934
01:10:19,594 --> 01:10:22,915
Your motion to receive this paper and place it on file.

935
01:10:23,295 --> 01:10:23,895
Seconded by Ms.

936
01:10:23,915 --> 01:10:24,515
Van de Kloet.

937
01:10:24,575 --> 01:10:25,355
All those in favor?

938
01:10:25,895 --> 01:10:25,976
Aye.

939
01:10:26,136 --> 01:10:26,916
All those opposed?

940
01:10:27,876 --> 01:10:28,676
Motion passes.

941
01:10:28,736 --> 01:10:29,136
Thank you.

942
01:10:29,597 --> 01:10:30,137
Thank you, John.

943
01:10:31,237 --> 01:10:32,478
Report on transportation.

944
01:10:32,498 --> 01:10:36,999
I'm going to call on our Director of Finance and Administration, Christine Patterson, to deliver this report.

945
01:10:38,447 --> 01:10:40,068
My favorite part of her job.

946
01:10:42,470 --> 01:10:44,392
Welcome.

947
01:10:44,432 --> 01:10:51,637
Just a confirmation from the bills that the Collins Esquire was independent arbitration, non-SPED related.

948
01:10:52,478 --> 01:10:53,799
The legal views for arbitration.

949
01:10:55,406 --> 01:10:55,666
Thank you.

950
01:10:56,167 --> 01:11:06,936
And just to start my presentation, I wanted to thank the parents for their patience and understanding as we continue to review the routes and stops on a daily basis.

951
01:11:07,076 --> 01:11:08,657
It is an ongoing process.

952
01:11:09,278 --> 01:11:10,499
It's very extensive.

953
01:11:10,519 --> 01:11:11,940
I've done site visits.

954
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,361
I'm working with the bus company.

955
01:11:13,721 --> 01:11:16,844
We're trying to make sure that the stops are safe for

956
01:11:17,532 --> 01:11:20,754
the buses to get through as well as students.

957
01:11:21,034 --> 01:11:24,335
So we continue to review these daily.

958
01:11:25,376 --> 01:11:31,799
Also a reminder that it's posted that the students be ready 10 minutes prior to the stop time.

959
01:11:32,239 --> 01:11:36,221
And this is to make sure that they are ready and prepared for the bus arrival.

960
01:11:36,921 --> 01:11:39,042
And start times are approximate.

961
01:11:39,163 --> 01:11:44,065
So the buses leave the yard and they attempt to get to the first location.

962
01:11:44,515 --> 01:11:45,576
as promptly as they can.

963
01:11:46,076 --> 01:11:50,058
Again, there's areas that more traffic is prevalent.

964
01:11:50,599 --> 01:11:59,885
Each stops thereafter have a three to five minute delay apart and traffic as well as weather conditions can play a part into the arrival time.

965
01:12:00,005 --> 01:12:07,509
So although the time is posted at a certain start time, the bus may get there a few minutes before, a few minutes after.

966
01:12:07,629 --> 01:12:10,151
So we just ask everybody to be aware of that.

967
01:12:12,255 --> 01:12:25,201
Moving forward with the summary, school year 2017-18 is year three of a three-year initial contract, and we will have two optional years with Eastern Bus Company.

968
01:12:26,422 --> 01:12:30,084
We have 17 regular routes that are serving St.

969
01:12:30,124 --> 01:12:31,664
Joseph Catholic School, St.

970
01:12:31,704 --> 01:12:33,245
Raphael Catholic School, St.

971
01:12:33,325 --> 01:12:36,627
Clements, and all of the Medford public schools.

972
01:12:37,604 --> 01:12:39,525
The current listings are included.

973
01:12:39,605 --> 01:12:46,130
Those were as of the last posted date, August 31st.

974
01:12:46,290 --> 01:12:51,854
We are still making new adjustments and those will be posted again at the end of this week.

975
01:12:53,295 --> 01:12:59,980
We had one yellow bus that was identified as a savings in the reduction of the Minuteman vocational transportation.

976
01:13:00,635 --> 01:13:10,243
We are utilizing a smaller minivan through Ride-Rite Transportation, and that is a daily rate of $280 versus $356 for a large yellow bus.

977
01:13:11,605 --> 01:13:26,077
The transition of the lower grade newcomers, I apologize, there was a typo in here from, it's actually the Brooks School, has created a new need for an additional yellow bus, and this is bus route number 18.

978
01:13:27,554 --> 01:13:34,537
So this bus transports only the newcomers that are across the city going to the Brooks School.

979
01:13:34,677 --> 01:13:38,018
And this does have currently fewer students than other routes.

980
01:13:38,098 --> 01:13:44,721
And this is due to the distance and pickups that are identified as a longer travel time to get them to that location.

981
01:13:45,221 --> 01:13:56,025
So as more students enter the district, there may be further need for an additional bus and other alternatives to transport these students to that location.

982
01:13:57,437 --> 01:14:03,140
The high school bus run has had supplemented overage the first week of school.

983
01:14:03,700 --> 01:14:12,785
Again, this was a little bit of a reaction to the MBTA that was still on the summer schedule and had limited bus runs coming up to the high school.

984
01:14:13,846 --> 01:14:26,613
Next year, we will do a yellow bus run that will be provided for the morning and communicated so that high schoolers don't have any issues getting here the first couple days that we're still on the

985
01:14:27,745 --> 01:14:29,786
summer schedule for the MBTA program.

986
01:14:30,427 --> 01:14:41,912
So again, as mentioned, all the routes continue to be reviewed for efficiencies and accommodations where we can provide ultimate safety as a priority for everyone involved.

987
01:14:42,893 --> 01:14:43,253
Very good.

988
01:14:43,293 --> 01:14:45,174
Are there any questions on Mr. Benedetto?

989
01:14:45,414 --> 01:14:46,555
I had some questions in notes.

990
01:14:47,930 --> 01:14:49,991
Mr. Benavetto and Ms.

991
01:14:50,011 --> 01:14:50,452
Kretz.

992
01:14:50,912 --> 01:14:59,018
So are there any issues right now, buses arriving late to the school buildings, or are they coming on time?

993
01:14:59,498 --> 01:15:00,779
There could be.

994
01:15:00,919 --> 01:15:09,345
It's not a regular issue, but there could be if there's a traffic situation or certain unidentified issues.

995
01:15:09,925 --> 01:15:14,268
As far as the regular scheduled bus, I have not heard that that's been an issue.

996
01:15:14,869 --> 01:15:14,929
OK.

997
01:15:15,229 --> 01:15:16,930
I know there's a lot of construction throughout.

998
01:15:17,734 --> 01:15:27,638
you know, the city right now, and I was just wondering if it was impacting parents or buses from getting to, like, for example, up to high school.

999
01:15:27,678 --> 01:15:30,880
I know that there was a lot of cars coming up for a while.

1000
01:15:31,740 --> 01:15:46,427
And I just was wondering if maybe even a principal, head of school had seen any or had had children coming in late because... It's certain that construction and traffic certainly does impact bus arrivals.

1001
01:15:47,755 --> 01:15:52,577
As a regular issue, I have not been made aware that that's occurring.

1002
01:15:53,478 --> 01:15:53,758
Great.

1003
01:15:54,158 --> 01:16:00,621
And my second question is, what are the number of students taking the bus to Minuteman and the enrollment in Minuteman now?

1004
01:16:01,281 --> 01:16:01,421
Eight.

1005
01:16:02,551 --> 01:16:05,454
eight students, so we only have eight students attending Minute Man.

1006
01:16:05,935 --> 01:16:07,416
Wow, that's phenomenal.

1007
01:16:07,736 --> 01:16:09,158
I feel like we're at two different meetings.

1008
01:16:09,598 --> 01:16:10,159
What was the answer?

1009
01:16:10,339 --> 01:16:11,861
She asked how many are at Minute Man.

1010
01:16:12,161 --> 01:16:12,401
Eight.

1011
01:16:12,501 --> 01:16:13,542
Oh, thank you.

1012
01:16:14,203 --> 01:16:15,524
Thank you, Mr. Benedetto.

1013
01:16:15,544 --> 01:16:15,664
Ms.

1014
01:16:15,705 --> 01:16:15,965
Kritz.

1015
01:16:16,445 --> 01:16:16,806
Oh, hi.

1016
01:16:17,466 --> 01:16:23,773
Thank you, Christine and Superintendent Belzin for getting back to me with all my questions that I had about the bus the first week of school.

1017
01:16:24,974 --> 01:16:45,790
I was really happy to read in this report that next year a yellow bus will be provided Information will be communicated for the first week for all of the people traveling to the high school There was a lot of parents that were concerned and there was a lot of information on Facebook You know what's going on with the bus and a lot of things going back and forth.

1018
01:16:45,870 --> 01:16:49,073
Thank you for all the communication and putting together the

1019
01:16:50,031 --> 01:16:51,753
part of the robocall.

1020
01:16:52,754 --> 01:16:58,520
I did hear from some people after the robocall with some concerns because

1021
01:16:59,556 --> 01:17:07,259
Part of the message that we relayed in an email communication wasn't included in the robocall, which caused a little confusion.

1022
01:17:07,659 --> 01:17:12,801
So some people didn't realize there was going to be a yellow bus traveling down Salem Street.

1023
01:17:13,681 --> 01:17:20,024
I think I communicated, Christine, and you mentioned that when the bus did arrive at the high school, it was nearly full.

1024
01:17:20,644 --> 01:17:28,069
And I wanted to share that information with the public because I was going back with a lot of parents because they wanted to know where I got that information.

1025
01:17:28,149 --> 01:17:29,529
You know, where was that coming from?

1026
01:17:30,290 --> 01:17:32,351
So there was a lot of confusion that first week.

1027
01:17:32,371 --> 01:17:37,294
I'm glad it's all rectified and thank you for handling it so well.

1028
01:17:38,595 --> 01:17:43,198
I did want to know something that came out from the discussions was

1029
01:17:43,858 --> 01:17:48,520
you know, why did we pick that particular route for the yellow bus?

1030
01:17:48,900 --> 01:17:54,702
Like, why wasn't it other communities like South Medford, West Medford, East Medford?

1031
01:17:54,982 --> 01:17:56,642
You know, I didn't have an answer for that.

1032
01:17:57,142 --> 01:18:02,544
So, you know, I just, I was kind of waiting for a report on the yellow bus itself.

1033
01:18:02,604 --> 01:18:05,425
I know that's something new that hasn't been done before.

1034
01:18:06,986 --> 01:18:10,107
Do you know why that particular route was used?

1035
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:13,588
Is that the conclusion of the question or is there more?

1036
01:18:15,755 --> 01:18:30,045
That was related to the yellow bus, you know, why the route was utilized on that particular day, you know, to just travel through, like, Salem Street and then go, you know, through, you know, Winthrop and then up to the high school.

1037
01:18:30,105 --> 01:18:30,785
Sure.

1038
01:18:30,845 --> 01:18:31,866
It's very simple.

1039
01:18:32,987 --> 01:18:40,232
Quite frankly, we were trying to scramble to make accommodations because the MBTA bus routes were not covered.

1040
01:18:41,194 --> 01:18:51,438
One of our yellow buses who happened to be traveling that route mid-morning identified that there were a number of high school students that he saw walking up in that direction.

1041
01:18:52,278 --> 01:18:55,780
Straight and simple, that was the method for getting a bus there.

1042
01:18:55,820 --> 01:19:05,263
We knew that there was at least 20 students that had been walking in that direction in that area, and that's a typical location for where the MBTA bus route would have picked up.

1043
01:19:05,883 --> 01:19:07,284
So it was not anything

1044
01:19:07,731 --> 01:19:11,453
We were not trying to exclude or anything of that sort.

1045
01:19:11,913 --> 01:19:20,638
It simply was a scramble to get some assistance on day one, day two, right after we were made aware of the situation.

1046
01:19:20,658 --> 01:19:32,805
So moving forward, that will be something that we will address with our yellow bus company to provide some overage in the first couple days when MBTA is still out on a summer break.

1047
01:19:33,185 --> 01:19:40,371
Additionally, there was some confusion with the MBTA passes, and that is not something that the school has any control over.

1048
01:19:40,391 --> 01:19:46,896
That is a state entity, and their bus passes are valid through the end of August.

1049
01:19:46,976 --> 01:19:51,380
However, the actual routes did not coincide with the start of school.

1050
01:19:51,780 --> 01:19:57,645
So there were still students writing the MBTA and or they had the availability on their

1051
01:19:58,173 --> 01:20:11,864
current summer MBTA cards, but all of that just had not been, you know, I was not here at the start of school last year, so I was not able to be privy to that and try to coordinate ahead of time.

1052
01:20:11,964 --> 01:20:17,028
So that is why we've identified this moving forward and next year we will address it.

1053
01:20:18,672 --> 01:20:19,012
Thank you.

1054
01:20:19,473 --> 01:20:19,633
Ms.

1055
01:20:19,653 --> 01:20:20,073
Mustone.

1056
01:20:20,693 --> 01:20:24,974
Christine, do you have an estimate of how many of our school children take buses?

1057
01:20:25,594 --> 01:20:26,295
Or could you get it?

1058
01:20:26,615 --> 01:20:27,235
I'm curious.

1059
01:20:27,395 --> 01:20:33,637
You know, at the Roberts, I try to encourage as many parents because it's such a traffic nightmare of how many students use our buses.

1060
01:20:33,657 --> 01:20:34,917
Right now, I don't.

1061
01:20:35,057 --> 01:20:42,679
We have a number of them that, and this becomes an issue because we have overcrowding in the mornings or in the afternoons.

1062
01:20:42,719 --> 01:20:44,460
So some get on and some get off.

1063
01:20:45,275 --> 01:20:48,638
Some take it one day, and then we have overcrowding the next day.

1064
01:20:48,738 --> 01:20:52,661
So it does make it difficult to establish these routes.

1065
01:20:52,721 --> 01:21:00,647
And that's another challenge that we have early on, because the riders that we're planning for then don't ride the rest of the year.

1066
01:21:00,907 --> 01:21:03,669
So stops are taken off, things of that sort.

1067
01:21:03,769 --> 01:21:07,072
So that's the issue that we have going forward.

1068
01:21:10,167 --> 01:21:23,135
District website a bus riding form that the school we've asked the schools to implement However, I don't have an accurate number of the actual riders at this point Could I request one for?

1069
01:21:24,236 --> 01:21:25,016
next few weeks

1070
01:21:26,942 --> 01:21:34,487
It may or may not be complete, because again, there's not a requirement that they ride, and there's not a requirement that they continue to ride.

1071
01:21:34,587 --> 01:21:37,529
But five of mine take the bus, and I filled out five forms.

1072
01:21:37,949 --> 01:21:41,232
So there is a form with the child's name on it in each of the schools.

1073
01:21:41,292 --> 01:21:43,813
So I'm just curious of what percent of each school.

1074
01:21:44,674 --> 01:21:48,056
I understand that some kids take it two mornings a week and three afternoons a week.

1075
01:21:48,336 --> 01:21:52,119
But even if we got an estimate of numbers, that'd be great.

1076
01:21:52,659 --> 01:21:52,859
Yeah.

1077
01:21:53,119 --> 01:21:53,500
Thank you.

1078
01:21:54,965 --> 01:21:55,105
Ms.

1079
01:21:55,145 --> 01:21:55,465
Cuno?

1080
01:21:56,286 --> 01:21:57,626
No, that was it.

1081
01:21:57,987 --> 01:22:00,208
I just had just a couple of follow-up questions.

1082
01:22:00,648 --> 01:22:06,951
So if a parent didn't get the robocall, who can they contact to get added to the call list?

1083
01:22:07,011 --> 01:22:11,514
Because that was also another concern that a lot of people said, I didn't get the robocall.

1084
01:22:11,534 --> 01:22:19,818
So I videoed the robocall and I put it on YouTube and then uploaded it to share it on Facebook so that they could hear it.

1085
01:22:20,258 --> 01:22:22,841
But I don't know why they didn't get it.

1086
01:22:23,401 --> 01:22:28,366
So that information is driven from the student information system.

1087
01:22:28,426 --> 01:22:39,736
So if the parent contact information has not been updated or there's a change of a phone number that was not provided to the school, that message could have been going to an invalid number.

1088
01:22:40,317 --> 01:22:41,638
So it's the same.

1089
01:22:42,521 --> 01:22:46,450
Robocall that's identified throughout the school year at the high school level.

1090
01:22:46,691 --> 01:22:50,078
Again, this is the high school level only that that Robocall was made.

1091
01:22:50,098 --> 01:22:51,441
It was not for all schools.

1092
01:22:53,897 --> 01:22:58,099
Yes, is it the student's homeroom teacher?

1093
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:00,260
What form would it be?

1094
01:23:00,300 --> 01:23:02,041
Who would they actually reach out to?

1095
01:23:03,662 --> 01:23:07,283
It's the general form that they submit each year.

1096
01:23:07,543 --> 01:23:11,745
So right now you went through that, the re-enrollment process.

1097
01:23:11,765 --> 01:23:13,446
So it's important if parents

1098
01:23:13,954 --> 01:23:24,683
have a change of demographic information during the course of a school year that they notify the school department so that that phone number can be updated and maintained in all the systems.

1099
01:23:25,244 --> 01:23:34,312
So that simply could have been a gap in some of that communication that was sent out.

1100
01:23:37,515 --> 01:23:39,576
And this is unrelated to the yellow bus,

1101
01:23:40,987 --> 01:23:46,332
So I also had some inquiries from students and parents who ride the Fulton Heights bus.

1102
01:23:46,853 --> 01:23:49,435
And in the morning, there's been a lot of overcrowding.

1103
01:23:50,096 --> 01:23:53,919
And I know I was told that last year there were two morning buses.

1104
01:23:54,280 --> 01:24:01,246
There was an early morning bus at like 6.50, and then there was a later morning bus, not too sure what the time was.

1105
01:24:01,567 --> 01:24:06,231
But I looked in the information you provided, and it looks like there are two buses.

1106
01:24:07,027 --> 01:24:09,249
But it looks like they're both at the same time.

1107
01:24:09,730 --> 01:24:15,795
So I don't know if maybe is that, I did note in here that there were two buses, Fulton Heights buses.

1108
01:24:15,835 --> 01:24:21,560
Right, and again, that's an issue of certain times and certain stops having overcrowding.

1109
01:24:21,580 --> 01:24:26,645
So there are two buses that they all try to

1110
01:24:27,437 --> 01:24:29,138
Enter the bus all at once.

1111
01:24:29,999 --> 01:24:33,462
And so there, you know, they may have to wait for the next bus to come in.

1112
01:24:33,682 --> 01:24:33,982
Okay.

1113
01:24:34,383 --> 01:24:38,666
So they do like, so one would come and another one comes right along and both kind of departed at 6 50.

1114
01:24:38,806 --> 01:24:39,387
Okay.

1115
01:24:42,389 --> 01:24:46,513
And one last suggestion I heard was, can we put

1116
01:24:47,107 --> 01:24:56,195
the MBTA bus stops on our website, almost similar to what we have here, but the actual MBTA bus stops.

1117
01:24:56,535 --> 01:25:00,999
So everything's centrally located on the one page or the one website.

1118
01:25:02,120 --> 01:25:04,341
It was a suggestion that came to me.

1119
01:25:05,467 --> 01:25:10,009
I think that would have to be requested through the MBTA if we were able to post that.

1120
01:25:10,049 --> 01:25:12,970
We can certainly provide a link to the MBTA.

1121
01:25:14,051 --> 01:25:20,413
But for us to capture their information, I don't know that we can do that legally.

1122
01:25:20,493 --> 01:25:26,896
But we can certainly inquire if there's a link that we can send parents to the MBTA schedule.

1123
01:25:27,455 --> 01:25:28,276
That would be nice.

1124
01:25:28,316 --> 01:25:33,661
If there was a direct link, they could click on the link, and then they could navigate around from there, if that's possible.

1125
01:25:33,682 --> 01:25:35,383
I mean, you probably have to check on that.

1126
01:25:36,124 --> 01:25:36,304
All right.

1127
01:25:36,384 --> 01:25:36,685
Thank you.

1128
01:25:37,205 --> 01:25:37,345
Ms.

1129
01:25:37,365 --> 01:25:37,686
Cuneo.

1130
01:25:38,366 --> 01:25:45,834
Actually, to go back to that, I would suggest the link only because they change their schedule many times, too.

1131
01:25:45,974 --> 01:25:47,316
And the last thing you want to do is

1132
01:25:49,217 --> 01:26:00,519
It's our responsibility for our students, but we also don't want to let our parents go on to like a schedule that we have that all of a sudden the MBTA changes yesterday or the day, you know, and we don't know.

1133
01:26:00,619 --> 01:26:02,740
So I think the link is probably our best bet on that.

1134
01:26:03,420 --> 01:26:05,480
The other thing is I do want to say thank you to you.

1135
01:26:05,880 --> 01:26:12,322
I know I called you for a few things and you took care of that, the particular routes very quickly for us and I appreciate that.

1136
01:26:14,162 --> 01:26:18,783
The other thing is basically going back to the telephones and that is, I know,

1137
01:26:20,244 --> 01:26:23,946
where I work, it's very difficult sometimes because people do change their cell phones.

1138
01:26:25,167 --> 01:26:31,191
Because some people change it because they just get rid of one and they go into another depending on the plan they have.

1139
01:26:32,392 --> 01:26:39,137
So I guess especially for the high school, and Dr. Perla, you're here, not to put you on the spot, but I think it would also be good if

1140
01:26:40,958 --> 01:26:56,035
Parents knew that if they were changing their telephones, or their numbers, or their emails, that they don't have to wait just for that form at the beginning of the year, or a form at the end of the year, because there are different things that happen during the year.

1141
01:26:56,615 --> 01:26:58,997
someone could lose their phone and they're borrowing someone else's phone.

1142
01:26:59,438 --> 01:27:03,761
So I think it's important that the responsibility is definitely on us, and I know that.

1143
01:27:04,122 --> 01:27:19,895
But I also know that it's very important that if a parent does change their telephone number, if there's a different number that they want us to contact, that they really do need to have that communication with the high school, the vocational school, to let us know what that is.

1144
01:27:20,595 --> 01:27:22,157
I don't know if it would be involved in the school.

1145
01:27:22,217 --> 01:27:24,319
Is that something that we could go on to school brains for?

1146
01:27:25,870 --> 01:27:29,852
I don't believe the parents can change it.

1147
01:27:30,012 --> 01:27:31,713
Because the parents can't go on that.

1148
01:27:32,473 --> 01:27:33,153
Parents can go on.

1149
01:27:33,353 --> 01:27:34,074
I have an idea.

1150
01:27:34,574 --> 01:27:36,435
You have the idea to go into school brains now?

1151
01:27:36,955 --> 01:27:37,395
Yes.

1152
01:27:37,515 --> 01:27:39,556
So the information is all on school brains.

1153
01:27:40,196 --> 01:27:47,840
And throughout the year, there are many opportunities for students and teachers and community members to interact through school brains, and that's when we edit the information.

1154
01:27:48,340 --> 01:27:55,243
So every time that there's a mailing, all report cards are connected to all the information system that we have in place.

1155
01:27:55,943 --> 01:28:01,287
So there are many opportunities for people to reach out and to provide changes.

1156
01:28:01,647 --> 01:28:04,249
We also contact families routinely.

1157
01:28:04,429 --> 01:28:13,676
So when we identify concerns such as something getting mailed back to us or a phone call being disconnected, we also reach out and try to establish what had taken place.

1158
01:28:14,056 --> 01:28:18,440
So this is happening throughout the school year and basically on a daily basis.

1159
01:28:18,940 --> 01:28:22,603
So I'm sorry, did you get the phone call, the robo call?

1160
01:28:25,018 --> 01:28:25,899
Is that the initial question?

1161
01:28:25,939 --> 01:28:29,001
Because I would assume that you had numbers in the system.

1162
01:28:29,061 --> 01:28:29,922
I can't hear.

1163
01:28:29,942 --> 01:28:31,903
Dr. Perlow, I didn't even hear what you said.

1164
01:28:31,923 --> 01:28:33,304
I'm sure it's very weird.

1165
01:28:33,344 --> 01:28:34,665
Someone didn't get a robocall.

1166
01:28:34,965 --> 01:28:36,767
Someone contacted her that did not get paid.

1167
01:28:36,787 --> 01:28:38,728
Yes, I have access to School Brains.

1168
01:28:39,429 --> 01:28:48,655
I got the robocall, but I went into School Brains last night just to navigate around again in preparation for this meeting.

1169
01:28:50,147 --> 01:28:55,288
I don't recall there's an area in School Brains that I can add my contact information.

1170
01:28:55,908 --> 01:28:58,169
I'm given a username and password.

1171
01:28:59,089 --> 01:29:07,331
There is a place in School Brains for parents to go and to edit their own information.

1172
01:29:07,351 --> 01:29:11,072
That's a process that we advocate, that they get on board, they check their information.

1173
01:29:11,092 --> 01:29:14,413
It's actually one of the best tools we have to make changes in the system.

1174
01:29:14,593 --> 01:29:17,556
So is that the list you use when you make the robocalls from school grades?

1175
01:29:17,756 --> 01:29:19,418
Everything comes from the same system.

1176
01:29:19,538 --> 01:29:21,700
So that's what I think Kathy's asking.

1177
01:29:21,720 --> 01:29:25,744
So does the parent just go online and change the information or do they call the school secretary?

1178
01:29:25,764 --> 01:29:26,104
They can.

1179
01:29:26,184 --> 01:29:27,745
Or they can contact us and we can do it as well.

1180
01:29:28,106 --> 01:29:30,328
It can be done really in a few different ways.

1181
01:29:30,748 --> 01:29:34,572
And what we do typically is on parent-teacher conferences we also remind parents of this as well.

1182
01:29:34,892 --> 01:29:41,300
Because we do have new parents coming in who need to get their information.

1183
01:29:42,182 --> 01:29:45,065
The other thing is that yes, we have school brains.

1184
01:29:45,125 --> 01:29:46,487
Yes, everybody's working.

1185
01:29:46,507 --> 01:29:49,871
No, I shouldn't say everyone's working on it because there are parents that feel comfortable on it.

1186
01:29:50,272 --> 01:29:53,015
There's parents that don't feel comfortable on it and that's something that

1187
01:29:53,516 --> 01:29:55,677
With time, hopefully it gets better.

1188
01:29:55,857 --> 01:29:57,677
But again, not everyone has access.

1189
01:29:58,077 --> 01:30:01,018
So I just want the word to be out there that yes, we have the school brains.

1190
01:30:01,058 --> 01:30:02,378
Yes, you could go on with a click.

1191
01:30:02,818 --> 01:30:10,500
But if you just happen to be going to work and you just have that two minutes waiting for a bus, that you want to contact the school.

1192
01:30:11,060 --> 01:30:13,001
Contact the school, let them know that you're updated.

1193
01:30:14,743 --> 01:30:18,727
telephone number is and that way hopefully we can get the communication on both sides.

1194
01:30:19,588 --> 01:30:21,971
The other thing is too is the robocalls.

1195
01:30:22,371 --> 01:30:26,676
I know as a parent and my kids were in the school system, I got them all the time.

1196
01:30:27,397 --> 01:30:29,380
As a school committee member, I'd still like to be on there.

1197
01:30:30,601 --> 01:30:32,143
Sure, it's fine with me.

1198
01:30:34,104 --> 01:30:36,066
Mr. Benedetto.

1199
01:30:36,886 --> 01:30:37,506
I agree.

1200
01:30:37,626 --> 01:30:40,008
I'd also like to get some notification.

1201
01:30:40,888 --> 01:30:45,030
It's very helpful for the school committee members to get notifications of what's going on.

1202
01:30:46,151 --> 01:30:48,132
If we could be added to the school bearings.

1203
01:30:49,773 --> 01:30:52,876
In some capacity, I'd like to request to do that as well.

1204
01:30:52,896 --> 01:31:04,808
We try to, if I could also, we sort of coordinate all of our communications through social media sites, through robocalls, through our, specifically our own website, of course, and then mailing sometimes.

1205
01:31:04,888 --> 01:31:11,295
So we, there's many different ways that we try to get information out to the public, and most of the time, 95% of the time, exactly the same message.

1206
01:31:12,402 --> 01:31:15,964
There was, I know there's some concern regarding the busing railroad call.

1207
01:31:16,044 --> 01:31:19,566
I think in a lot of that situation, it was sort of minute by minute.

1208
01:31:19,766 --> 01:31:28,610
Specifically, the MBTA basically told me on a daily basis that they would have buses available, but it was dependent on bus drivers coming and doing overtime.

1209
01:31:28,891 --> 01:31:31,512
They wouldn't know that information until the middle of the afternoon.

1210
01:31:32,052 --> 01:31:33,653
So we were sort of blind as well.

1211
01:31:34,093 --> 01:31:39,835
And the evening of the robocall, I believe that that decision had been made prior to me making the actual message.

1212
01:31:41,055 --> 01:31:42,716
So I understand there's a concern there.

1213
01:31:42,736 --> 01:31:47,737
But luckily, like I just mentioned, there are many different ways that we actually communicate that message.

1214
01:31:47,757 --> 01:31:53,219
So it got out to pretty much everyone in the same population, because we know the buses were full.

1215
01:31:53,299 --> 01:31:57,420
So again, it's a minor technical issue from our end, I think.

1216
01:31:58,196 --> 01:31:59,717
Mr. Benedetto, follow up?

1217
01:31:59,937 --> 01:32:01,658
Just- Off subject.

1218
01:32:02,298 --> 01:32:03,679
About the subject, but St.

1219
01:32:03,719 --> 01:32:08,262
Clement's closed their doors, so I don't think we're busing to them anymore.

1220
01:32:08,862 --> 01:32:09,042
St.

1221
01:32:09,082 --> 01:32:11,564
Clement's closed its school.

1222
01:32:11,584 --> 01:32:13,805
I heard that part.

1223
01:32:13,845 --> 01:32:14,425
What was the rest?

1224
01:32:14,465 --> 01:32:14,866
That's it.

1225
01:32:15,306 --> 01:32:16,347
We're not busing there anymore.

1226
01:32:16,367 --> 01:32:17,267
We're not busing there anymore.

1227
01:32:17,287 --> 01:32:17,367
Okay.

1228
01:32:18,148 --> 01:32:18,528
Thank you.

1229
01:32:20,005 --> 01:32:23,788
Is there a motion to receive this paper and place it on file?

1230
01:32:23,808 --> 01:32:24,168
Yes.

1231
01:32:25,209 --> 01:32:26,610
Seconded by Ms.

1232
01:32:27,151 --> 01:32:27,991
Quinn Lestone.

1233
01:32:28,712 --> 01:32:29,473
All those in favor?

1234
01:32:29,973 --> 01:32:30,113
Aye.

1235
01:32:30,273 --> 01:32:30,914
All those opposed?

1236
01:32:30,954 --> 01:32:31,554
Motion passes.

1237
01:32:31,614 --> 01:32:36,578
Is there a motion for suspension of the rules to take community participation?

1238
01:32:37,119 --> 01:32:37,999
Yes.

1239
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:40,381
On the motion for suspension, all those in favor?

1240
01:32:40,661 --> 01:32:40,742
Aye.

1241
01:32:40,902 --> 01:32:41,522
All those opposed?

1242
01:32:41,542 --> 01:32:42,463
Suspension is granted.

1243
01:32:42,923 --> 01:32:46,626
Are there residents in the audience that would like to speak under community participation?

1244
01:32:47,867 --> 01:32:48,288
Madam Mayor.

1245
01:32:49,968 --> 01:32:51,349
I would just like to say one thing.

1246
01:32:51,369 --> 01:33:02,293
I don't know whether, and this obviously is totally up to you, because you're certainly free to make any statement you want to us, whether you want to make a public statement or you want to talk to our Attorney General directly.

1247
01:33:02,373 --> 01:33:07,415
So I just want to put that out as to whether this is an issue you want aired publicly.

1248
01:33:11,596 --> 01:33:12,316
I just wanted to make sure.

1249
01:33:14,938 --> 01:33:15,358
Good evening.

1250
01:33:15,518 --> 01:33:16,499
My name is Cheryl Knowles.

1251
01:33:16,719 --> 01:33:18,540
I'm here with my partner, Annalee Wells.

1252
01:33:19,541 --> 01:33:28,228
We're here to request the re-enrollment of our daughters, Avery and Luca Denning Knowles, into Columbus Elementary.

1253
01:33:30,609 --> 01:33:36,594
We have 50-50 shared custody with my former spouse, who resides in North Andover.

1254
01:33:39,250 --> 01:33:44,052
The kids currently reside in Medford five nights out of the week.

1255
01:33:44,532 --> 01:33:47,153
And this has been the case since March of 2017.

1256
01:33:49,073 --> 01:33:50,974
We enrolled the kids in Medford.

1257
01:33:50,994 --> 01:33:54,115
My ex-spouse came in.

1258
01:33:54,135 --> 01:34:03,838
And from what I can gather, presented an expired temporary order from last year

1259
01:34:05,136 --> 01:34:15,159
that stated that Avery would go to Atkinson Elementary in North Andover, and Luca would remain in Little Sprouts, where she was attending preschool.

1260
01:34:16,200 --> 01:34:20,061
That temporary order was put in place because a trial was scheduled.

1261
01:34:20,981 --> 01:34:23,742
The trial was held in March of this year.

1262
01:34:28,637 --> 01:34:40,924
A court order was provided and it supersedes the temporary order, which stated that the court would not make a decision on where the children would attend school.

1263
01:34:42,105 --> 01:34:51,410
They wanted me and my ex-partner to work it out amongst ourselves and come to a decision together.

1264
01:34:51,790 --> 01:34:54,672
So the court denied my request

1265
01:34:55,412 --> 01:35:01,039
to order my children to attend Medford Public Schools.

1266
01:35:01,340 --> 01:35:03,483
They're currently not in any school right now.

1267
01:35:04,964 --> 01:35:09,070
North Andover Public School District has chosen to not act.

1268
01:35:09,890 --> 01:35:13,591
on these court orders because there is no court order in place.

1269
01:35:14,772 --> 01:35:18,573
They would be able to be enrolled in North Andover Public Schools.

1270
01:35:19,073 --> 01:35:28,716
However, because they reside in Bedford five nights out of the week, it doesn't make any sense logistically or financially for my kids to attend school in North Andover.

1271
01:35:30,757 --> 01:35:37,419
We had had a short order notice court hearing this past Wednesday where we were hoping that

1272
01:35:38,415 --> 01:35:41,556
the judge would make a decision as to where our children would attend school.

1273
01:35:42,476 --> 01:35:48,759
And she stated that she's not going to make a decision where our children attend school.

1274
01:35:48,899 --> 01:35:55,041
She stated that it's up to the parents to decide through mediation.

1275
01:35:55,581 --> 01:36:02,803
And this has been a two-year contentious court battle.

1276
01:36:02,883 --> 01:36:05,484
We have been unable to come to an agreement.

1277
01:36:05,904 --> 01:36:07,445
So we currently have two children

1278
01:36:08,148 --> 01:36:12,711
We're out of school, and we're requesting a re-enrollment.

1279
01:36:13,011 --> 01:36:19,374
Did I understand you correctly that you said that there's a court order in place that says they can't come to Medford or Medford?

1280
01:36:19,394 --> 01:36:22,236
No, there is no court order for them to go to school in North Andover.

1281
01:36:22,596 --> 01:36:25,538
There's no court order for them to go to school in Medford.

1282
01:36:25,578 --> 01:36:28,319
There's no court order saying they can't go to school in Medford.

1283
01:36:28,559 --> 01:36:31,021
There's no court order saying they can't go to school in North Andover.

1284
01:36:31,041 --> 01:36:34,283
Additionally, my attorney

1285
01:36:35,458 --> 01:36:48,567
Sent correspondence to my ex-spouse's attorney, Josiah Weiss, just stating, please advise your client that Judge Vesenius' temporary order is extinguished by the judgment entered by Judge Ordonez.

1286
01:36:48,807 --> 01:36:49,808
That was the March trial.

1287
01:36:50,028 --> 01:37:01,776
Which was the March trial where Judge Ordonez ordered us to mediation and stated that she would not order the kids to go to Medford Public Schools.

1288
01:37:03,157 --> 01:37:04,398
She did not bar enrollment.

1289
01:37:05,324 --> 01:37:07,825
She simply stated she was not going to make an order.

1290
01:37:09,045 --> 01:37:11,226
So when you, sorry.

1291
01:37:11,906 --> 01:37:12,086
Ms.

1292
01:37:12,106 --> 01:37:12,726
Mestone?

1293
01:37:13,046 --> 01:37:18,168
So when you came here to the Parent Information Center to enroll your children, were they all set to go?

1294
01:37:18,248 --> 01:37:18,708
Yes, they were.

1295
01:37:18,848 --> 01:37:19,869
So then what happened?

1296
01:37:19,929 --> 01:37:21,829
I'm just confused of how it all went down.

1297
01:37:21,949 --> 01:37:25,150
So they were medically cleared and enrolled.

1298
01:37:25,711 --> 01:37:28,031
I had received a class assignment for Luka.

1299
01:37:28,311 --> 01:37:29,972
I had not received one for Avery.

1300
01:37:30,912 --> 01:37:31,592
I came in,

1301
01:37:34,022 --> 01:37:45,908
probably about a week before school started, to turn in my last immunization record, and they were medically cleared, at which time I met with Ms.

1302
01:37:45,948 --> 01:37:57,713
Caldwell, who also informed me that she had a meeting with my ex-partner that same morning, because she was not in agreeance with my kids attending school and met her.

1303
01:37:58,934 --> 01:38:00,915
And I mean, maybe we have- Which led to,

1304
01:38:02,382 --> 01:38:06,284
Mr. Benson denying their involvement.

1305
01:38:07,324 --> 01:38:11,166
So I don't know the law, but isn't it wherever you lie your head the most is where you go to school?

1306
01:38:13,207 --> 01:38:16,848
But it seems like the court order isn't live.

1307
01:38:18,389 --> 01:38:19,189
Mr. Superintendent.

1308
01:38:19,610 --> 01:38:20,830
So let me answer it this way.

1309
01:38:22,271 --> 01:38:25,172
Certainly, we want youngsters to go to school.

1310
01:38:25,452 --> 01:38:27,693
We're not against our young people coming to school.

1311
01:38:28,273 --> 01:38:31,615
That's obvious that we don't want to bar kids from school.

1312
01:38:32,261 --> 01:38:43,690
But we have, despite of what you've heard, and I'll refer to our attorney in a moment, we have a court order that has not been rescinded by the Essex court and Essex probate court.

1313
01:38:44,051 --> 01:38:47,514
I'm just going to read the plain language of what it says.

1314
01:38:47,574 --> 01:38:51,597
It was issued on May 18th, and I have nothing that contradicts it.

1315
01:38:52,077 --> 01:38:55,740
I've asked repeatedly, if you've got something that contradicts it, I'll honor it.

1316
01:38:56,201 --> 01:38:57,602
But I don't have anything.

1317
01:38:58,022 --> 01:39:01,465
And I'm not going to be in contempt of court for myself or for the school committee.

1318
01:39:02,021 --> 01:39:15,491
It says, at review of judgment of modification memorandum of decision dated March 30th, that's what they're referring to, 2017, the plaintiff's motion dated April 10th, 2017, the court enters the following order.

1319
01:39:16,472 --> 01:39:16,712
Order.

1320
01:39:17,793 --> 01:39:22,457
Plaintiff's request for an order to enroll the children in the Medford Public Schools is denied.

1321
01:39:24,295 --> 01:39:26,536
My request for an order was denied.

1322
01:39:27,097 --> 01:39:29,538
Look, I can't argue with you.

1323
01:39:29,818 --> 01:39:31,079
I can't argue with you.

1324
01:39:31,099 --> 01:39:34,320
I can't argue with you.

1325
01:39:34,360 --> 01:39:38,482
We have an attorney here who spoke to Lisa Greenberg, your attorney, today.

1326
01:39:39,463 --> 01:39:43,365
So maybe Mr. Greenspan can come up and clarify what we're talking about.

1327
01:39:49,528 --> 01:39:50,308
Good evening, everybody.

1328
01:39:50,829 --> 01:39:53,550
I did speak to the Parents Council today.

1329
01:39:54,984 --> 01:40:07,228
Lisa Greenberg, who did inform me that she appeared at court last week on an emergency motion, and that motion, there is no decision yet on that motion.

1330
01:40:08,088 --> 01:40:15,310
And I asked her when she did get her decision on the motion to let us know if it did

1331
01:40:16,025 --> 01:40:19,466
provide for enrollment of the children in the Medford Public Schools.

1332
01:40:19,927 --> 01:40:27,010
And upon receipt of that order, we would expedite the registration and enrollment of those children.

1333
01:40:27,610 --> 01:40:38,054
The last thing I saw is what Mr. Belson just read to you, the court order of May of 2017 denying the motion.

1334
01:40:38,895 --> 01:40:42,056
And that's where we stand.

1335
01:40:46,221 --> 01:40:54,330
It's a denial of the, the last ruling of the court is not to enroll the children in the Metro Public Schools.

1336
01:40:55,731 --> 01:40:59,475
So the order that's standing right now is not to enroll.

1337
01:40:59,796 --> 01:41:00,717
That's for March.

1338
01:41:01,425 --> 01:41:03,486
May, I believe, May of 2017.

1339
01:41:05,067 --> 01:41:17,136
Mr. Greenspan, are you under the impression that their attorney and you are in agreement on this order, or does she contradict what you're saying?

1340
01:41:19,157 --> 01:41:29,043
She didn't necessarily contradict what I was saying, but she said that in my conversation, she said the situation is confusing and

1341
01:41:31,342 --> 01:41:37,384
She further told me that they did go in last week for an emergency order which has not been ruled on.

1342
01:41:40,125 --> 01:41:43,707
That I don't know.

1343
01:41:45,868 --> 01:41:55,631
Mr. Greenspan, does the school committee have the right to direct the superintendent to enroll the students or would that be in contempt of court?

1344
01:41:58,673 --> 01:42:03,060
Well, from my reading of the current documents, I would not advise that.

1345
01:42:04,742 --> 01:42:06,803
I haven't seen the document.

1346
01:42:06,923 --> 01:42:08,264
One at a time, please.

1347
01:42:08,364 --> 01:42:15,307
I mean, this is a really difficult issue for us because I think that we have great sympathy and we certainly want to get the kids to school.

1348
01:42:15,627 --> 01:42:22,290
Frankly, wherever they're going to school, we want those kids to be enrolled in school and resume their normal education path.

1349
01:42:22,910 --> 01:42:29,533
As a one school committee member, I feel great sympathy, but I don't think this is in my purview as much as I might want it to be.

1350
01:42:32,174 --> 01:42:32,795
Mr. Skerry.

1351
01:42:35,440 --> 01:42:40,741
As I read the decision, plaintiff's request for an order to enroll the children in public schools is denied.

1352
01:42:40,761 --> 01:42:44,502
The plaintiff asked for an order and the judge denied it.

1353
01:42:45,042 --> 01:42:48,083
Denied by request for an order.

1354
01:42:48,103 --> 01:42:48,243
Right.

1355
01:42:48,263 --> 01:42:51,824
So the judge wasn't going to issue an order so that your children could go to school.

1356
01:42:51,844 --> 01:42:52,204
Correct.

1357
01:42:52,644 --> 01:42:58,545
So I would see this as a moot point because the courts can't tell us who we can take in and who we can't, can they?

1358
01:42:59,305 --> 01:42:59,966
Mr. Greenspan?

1359
01:43:03,369 --> 01:43:17,272
I really don't have much further to add other than to what's in front of you, which is the last order of the court, it was in May, was not to enroll the children in Metro Public Schools.

1360
01:43:18,932 --> 01:43:19,952
That's my understanding.

1361
01:43:21,312 --> 01:43:23,373
I've seen it every day, I've seen it, yes.

1362
01:43:24,513 --> 01:43:30,734
Judge, Donia's indicated that she wasn't gonna rule on the plaintiff's request, so it's like no contest yet.

1363
01:43:32,984 --> 01:43:43,826
The way I look at it after being in the field of law enforcement for 32 years, some consideration should be given to the parents.

1364
01:43:43,846 --> 01:43:46,146
The children are going to live here for five days a week.

1365
01:43:47,486 --> 01:43:50,907
And as a member of the call, we have an obligation to educate them.

1366
01:43:51,867 --> 01:43:54,368
Denying access to our kids in public school.

1367
01:43:54,808 --> 01:43:55,288
Right.

1368
01:43:56,048 --> 01:44:01,089
You're saying no when there is no poor person that cannot go to Medford public schools.

1369
01:44:01,549 --> 01:44:02,209
I'm not saying no.

1370
01:44:04,145 --> 01:44:12,753
Well, if I can, if I can, let me try and go through the sequence that I'm faced in this situation.

1371
01:44:12,813 --> 01:44:20,079
I understand everybody is sympathetic to children being in school, and so am I, even though it doesn't seem that way to the parents right now.

1372
01:44:20,899 --> 01:44:23,982
But the reality is, is that on March 30th, there was a hearing.

1373
01:44:24,883 --> 01:44:28,025
And then Lisa Greenberg, who represents Ms.

1374
01:44:28,045 --> 01:44:32,229
Knowles, made a request to the court

1375
01:44:33,082 --> 01:44:36,565
and you have it in your packet, as to where the children should attend school.

1376
01:44:37,446 --> 01:44:38,166
And I'm going to read it.

1377
01:44:38,987 --> 01:44:51,076
In denying the plaintiff's request to sole legal custody regarding education decisions, the court has made no decision nor given either party, either party, the right to enroll the children in school.

1378
01:44:51,717 --> 01:44:55,240
So if either party does not have the right to enroll them in school, who does?

1379
01:44:55,260 --> 01:44:58,622
And then you go on to the next letter,

1380
01:44:59,444 --> 01:45:04,849
which says, by the way, it says this only can result in contempt to be filed by one of the parties against the other.

1381
01:45:06,191 --> 01:45:16,000
And then the next document that we have denies their request for an order to enroll them in the Medford Public Schools.

1382
01:45:16,080 --> 01:45:18,703
Right now, it's between them.

1383
01:45:18,723 --> 01:45:23,107
Now why the court has not acted and intervened and made a decision, I don't know.

1384
01:45:25,617 --> 01:45:29,519
It is my problem because I represent a city and I cannot be in contempt of court.

1385
01:45:29,839 --> 01:45:30,980
You're not in contempt of court.

1386
01:45:31,020 --> 01:45:31,940
That's your opinion.

1387
01:45:32,360 --> 01:45:33,141
That's your opinion.

1388
01:45:33,321 --> 01:45:34,562
I'm sorry I have a legal counsel.

1389
01:45:34,602 --> 01:45:35,322
It's your opinion.

1390
01:45:35,342 --> 01:45:38,644
Mr. Greenspan, your opinion, please.

1391
01:45:39,884 --> 01:45:41,205
My opinion is what I stated.

1392
01:45:41,245 --> 01:45:51,330
I would not, at this particular time, enroll these children in Medford unless there is some clarification of that court order that was issued in May.

1393
01:45:52,791 --> 01:45:54,472
Can we be an intervening party?

1394
01:45:57,227 --> 01:45:59,748
I don't believe you have any standing in this matter.

1395
01:45:59,768 --> 01:46:03,430
Why is North Andover able to take no action and stay out of it?

1396
01:46:04,090 --> 01:46:06,691
Because there's nothing in their- Because there's no forward.

1397
01:46:06,831 --> 01:46:12,134
Their council, North Andover's council said- There's nothing that says they can't enroll them in the North Andover schools.

1398
01:46:12,494 --> 01:46:20,377
Look, they don't have the same, if you read the thing, they don't say you can't enroll them in the North Andover public schools, it says the Medford public schools.

1399
01:46:20,397 --> 01:46:24,639
It doesn't say they can't enroll them in the Medford public schools.

1400
01:46:24,759 --> 01:46:26,680
You're reading it one way- I read it, I was there.

1401
01:46:27,696 --> 01:46:29,978
I'm referring to my legal counsel.

1402
01:46:30,098 --> 01:46:32,440
I'm not a lawyer, so I'll refer to my legal counsel.

1403
01:46:32,880 --> 01:46:39,004
And so I'm going to take that as advice to me, not to place myself or the school committee in contempt.

1404
01:46:39,525 --> 01:46:40,165
I am very.

1405
01:46:40,665 --> 01:46:44,748
Wouldn't it be my contempt charge, though, as a parent, in ruling against my partner?

1406
01:46:44,828 --> 01:46:46,430
I'm willing to take that contempt charge.

1407
01:46:46,630 --> 01:46:47,310
That's our contempt.

1408
01:46:47,350 --> 01:46:48,051
That's not yours.

1409
01:46:48,991 --> 01:46:52,154
And would you rather have a contempt charge or a lawsuit for denying access

1410
01:46:52,838 --> 01:46:55,319
Look, I'm waiting for a decision.

1411
01:46:55,399 --> 01:46:56,560
I called the court.

1412
01:46:56,880 --> 01:47:02,243
Meanwhile, my children are at school when all of their friends and peers have started two weeks ago.

1413
01:47:03,084 --> 01:47:05,585
I called the court and asked the people.

1414
01:47:05,865 --> 01:47:07,026
Please, please, one at a time.

1415
01:47:07,386 --> 01:47:08,287
I called the court.

1416
01:47:08,567 --> 01:47:11,629
We asked the people to go over the records and interpret it for us.

1417
01:47:12,209 --> 01:47:14,610
They told me that my interpretation was correct.

1418
01:47:15,191 --> 01:47:19,053
I've asked my legal counsel to tell me what is my interpretation.

1419
01:47:19,393 --> 01:47:20,934
He tells me I'm doing the right thing.

1420
01:47:21,498 --> 01:47:30,621
Now, if you can get the court to act, or you can agree with your ex-partner on where the child is going to school, we will expedite that enrollment.

1421
01:47:31,021 --> 01:47:37,024
And we will even give you compensatory services, because I think it would be in the best interest of the child.

1422
01:47:37,484 --> 01:47:41,945
But I certainly can't, in this point, given what I know, act on it.

1423
01:47:43,126 --> 01:47:44,386
Just one more clarification.

1424
01:47:44,446 --> 01:47:48,408
The trial in March was about where Avery would go to school.

1425
01:47:49,928 --> 01:47:55,232
There has been no decision, so that March decision only reflects Avery.

1426
01:47:55,532 --> 01:47:56,693
Where does Luka go to school?

1427
01:47:56,833 --> 01:47:57,654
She was in Pre-K.

1428
01:47:57,774 --> 01:48:00,797
There's no order, no comment about where Luka goes to school.

1429
01:48:02,978 --> 01:48:08,002
That whole trial in March was about Avery's placement.

1430
01:48:09,043 --> 01:48:11,685
And the temporary order was only applied to Avery.

1431
01:48:13,192 --> 01:48:22,420
I don't know about that.

1432
01:48:22,580 --> 01:48:25,802
I just read the documents.

1433
01:48:25,822 --> 01:48:26,022
Ms.

1434
01:48:26,043 --> 01:48:26,463
Cuno.

1435
01:48:28,064 --> 01:48:36,331
I know emotions are getting high and for every right, but the thing is that I guess I'm looking at this in different ways and that is

1436
01:48:37,962 --> 01:48:46,107
We're not waiting or just personally as a school committee member, I'm not waiting on just what the superintendent is saying.

1437
01:48:46,968 --> 01:48:51,231
At this point in time, we're talking about legal papers with laws and rules.

1438
01:48:51,751 --> 01:48:53,792
That is why we have our legal representation.

1439
01:48:54,133 --> 01:48:58,616
That is why we made sure today that Mr. Greenspan would speak to your attorney.

1440
01:48:59,536 --> 01:49:06,863
I guess my question is, is that you're saying that it doesn't say the North Reading School or North Andover School.

1441
01:49:07,043 --> 01:49:18,054
But it does say, with consideration resolving issues and pending, and you and your partner come to a resolution.

1442
01:49:18,474 --> 01:49:21,856
Can I ask at least what your partner wants?

1443
01:49:21,896 --> 01:49:24,377
Does she want them in North Andover?

1444
01:49:25,638 --> 01:49:26,959
I'm sorry, X, I'm sorry.

1445
01:49:27,719 --> 01:49:28,720
I'm sorry, I apologize.

1446
01:49:28,740 --> 01:49:35,624
She wants them in North Andover and she's also filed a motion to change our parenting agreement.

1447
01:49:36,388 --> 01:49:40,711
And she is trying to get Monday through Friday periodically scheduled.

1448
01:49:41,391 --> 01:49:48,755
So that's not scheduled to be heard until December 21st for a pretrial, which I guarantee will go to a trial, and I'm not agreeing with that.

1449
01:49:49,316 --> 01:49:52,357
And it's not going to be heard until mid next year, maybe?

1450
01:49:52,838 --> 01:50:03,244
OK, so then I guess at this point in time, if our hands are tied, then could I ask Mr. Greenspan, is it possible, I know that you were working or speaking to their attorney, but

1451
01:50:04,184 --> 01:50:06,286
It depends, I guess, on how you're reading this letter.

1452
01:50:06,366 --> 01:50:12,810
So is there any way that you could call, I mean, I don't know, the Attorney General or someone just to find out what the clarification on this is?

1453
01:50:12,830 --> 01:50:14,331
There's nobody for me to call.

1454
01:50:15,052 --> 01:50:16,813
There's nobody for me to call.

1455
01:50:17,073 --> 01:50:22,257
So the bottom line is this is how it is being interpreted and this is how we have to abide by because it's a law.

1456
01:50:23,658 --> 01:50:26,520
Until last week's motion is ruled on.

1457
01:50:26,540 --> 01:50:30,623
The judge stated that she may not take any action on it.

1458
01:50:32,162 --> 01:50:39,365
and you'll still be here and with us here at the next committee meeting.

1459
01:50:40,565 --> 01:50:43,606
Mr. Greenspan, let me ask you one question.

1460
01:50:43,626 --> 01:50:47,888
Is it acceptable protocol for us to petition a judge?

1461
01:50:49,769 --> 01:50:52,210
I don't really think we have any standing in the matter.

1462
01:50:56,887 --> 01:50:57,548
May I follow up?

1463
01:50:57,568 --> 01:50:58,389
I think we can try.

1464
01:50:58,549 --> 01:50:58,770
Right.

1465
01:50:59,611 --> 01:51:06,461
I don't really... My feeling, too, is that I understand you're saying we may not have the standing, but if we don't at least try.

1466
01:51:06,821 --> 01:51:12,529
Obviously, it's in the best interest of the students, of the children, that we make the decision.

1467
01:51:14,186 --> 01:51:18,929
And so, I would at least want to petition them, even if it's for a temporary placement.

1468
01:51:19,690 --> 01:51:22,792
So, could we ask you to do that?

1469
01:51:22,832 --> 01:51:29,376
Could you look into whether there are any actions we can take?

1470
01:51:29,476 --> 01:51:30,457
I can look into that.

1471
01:51:30,577 --> 01:51:35,300
I can't tell you right now that that's something that we can do, but I'll look into it.

1472
01:51:38,427 --> 01:51:52,064
just basically that and I do think that it would probably be a good idea for you to do it so that way at least the parents really you know and we ask

1473
01:51:52,684 --> 01:52:02,454
I mean, if there's any type of loophole that even temporarily, if that's something that would be agreed upon, at least we could do something so the children don't stay out of school all this time.

1474
01:52:02,874 --> 01:52:13,625
But in also a confirmation for us that if it's something that we really can't touch because of the law and the way it's written, at least it will confirm on our side too.

1475
01:52:16,939 --> 01:52:19,741
The loophole which Northendo opted for was to stay out of it.

1476
01:52:20,221 --> 01:52:23,103
They said there is no action for us to take action on.

1477
01:52:23,303 --> 01:52:24,143
We have nothing.

1478
01:52:24,463 --> 01:52:26,425
We're here from their counsel.

1479
01:52:26,705 --> 01:52:38,292
Right, but with all due respect, because there is a rule saying where you lay your head, and it is very specific that it's knowledge that the children are here five days a week.

1480
01:52:38,632 --> 01:52:40,313
There's nothing for them to make a decision on.

1481
01:52:41,666 --> 01:52:42,927
They're not in their city.

1482
01:52:43,748 --> 01:52:47,011
And that is the reason why they can't even make a decision for them.

1483
01:52:47,051 --> 01:52:50,655
It's a mute decision because there's nothing for them to make a decision on.

1484
01:52:51,396 --> 01:52:52,837
They're allowing enrollment?

1485
01:52:58,122 --> 01:53:01,464
So, do I have the kids going, I mean, for the time being at least.

1486
01:53:01,864 --> 01:53:06,087
I apologize, for some reason I thought they said that they had, they're not involved.

1487
01:53:06,187 --> 01:53:08,729
Are there any other questions from the board, Mr. Benedetto?

1488
01:53:30,378 --> 01:53:57,152
Is there any way that we could provide services as if they were homeschooled students, that we could provide some curriculum-based information that at least the children are being educated, even if it is at home for the time being, until the parents can take further action or we can somehow try to help this family work this issue out?

1489
01:54:04,206 --> 01:54:05,667
Are they considered enrolled?

1490
01:54:07,909 --> 01:54:15,013
I'm not 100% sure, but if we take jurisdiction of the children and approve a homeschooling plan, it's tantamount to doing the same thing.

1491
01:54:16,214 --> 01:54:23,118
Obviously, and I'm just using my logic, which may or may not be 100% correct, I have to admit that.

1492
01:54:24,072 --> 01:54:35,660
But I'm using my logic to say that what the judge wants to have happen is the parties to agree on something so there won't be an ongoing conflict between the parents, which may affect the child.

1493
01:54:36,140 --> 01:54:41,824
And apparently that hasn't happened for whatever reason, and I'm not going to weigh in on that.

1494
01:54:42,665 --> 01:54:48,209
Obviously, we're in a situation right now where we need a decision, and we don't have one.

1495
01:54:54,311 --> 01:54:58,374
that can go to the court system, Adelante or whatever they call it.

1496
01:54:58,394 --> 01:55:02,518
Can they assign an advocate for your child to get enrolled here?

1497
01:55:02,538 --> 01:55:04,859
Petition the judge, the advocate.

1498
01:55:05,980 --> 01:55:07,121
The general, they can be.

1499
01:55:07,962 --> 01:55:12,306
That would be up to the judge who has jurisdiction over the case.

1500
01:55:12,446 --> 01:55:15,568
So perhaps you can speak to the courts tomorrow about that too.

1501
01:55:15,628 --> 01:55:17,930
There's one other piece that I'll introduce.

1502
01:55:17,950 --> 01:55:18,030
Ms.

1503
01:55:19,351 --> 01:55:20,893
Knowles has filed a

1504
01:55:21,872 --> 01:55:24,694
complaint with the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education.

1505
01:55:25,414 --> 01:55:26,455
And I saw that today.

1506
01:55:26,475 --> 01:55:31,238
I put a phone call into them asking them for some guidance.

1507
01:55:31,859 --> 01:55:33,520
Maybe they can intercede with the court.

1508
01:55:34,420 --> 01:55:35,001
I don't know.

1509
01:55:35,781 --> 01:55:38,983
But I put a phone call into them asking them for guidance.

1510
01:55:40,184 --> 01:55:45,527
You have another piece of information in your folder about when we talked about the B-1, B-2 visa situation.

1511
01:55:46,188 --> 01:55:50,711
And finally the AG, and finally the DESE ruled on something and told us

1512
01:55:51,204 --> 01:55:54,065
what they prefer, even though it was ambiguous.

1513
01:55:54,685 --> 01:56:01,187
And I got a phone call from Rhoda Schneider, who is the general legal counsel from the state, saying thank you for asking that question.

1514
01:56:01,987 --> 01:56:05,708
Because there are things, there are gray areas that we're caught in the middle of.

1515
01:56:06,008 --> 01:56:12,570
And I'm sure it's going to get even grayer as we deal with DACA and other considerations in the weeks and months ahead.

1516
01:56:13,872 --> 01:56:16,135
I would love to enroll the children if it's possible.

1517
01:56:16,395 --> 01:56:18,717
I have no reason not to want to educate them.

1518
01:56:19,257 --> 01:56:21,920
They're two young children that we want to help families.

1519
01:56:21,940 --> 01:56:23,221
We have no reason not to want to.

1520
01:56:23,261 --> 01:56:23,982
I don't know you.

1521
01:56:24,002 --> 01:56:25,984
Do you have any animus toward you?

1522
01:56:26,844 --> 01:56:31,368
But I do have paper in front of me that leads me to believe I'm not allowed to.

1523
01:56:31,909 --> 01:56:34,091
And I would like it resolved as much as you would.

1524
01:56:36,817 --> 01:56:41,340
We'll leave it to you, Mr. Greenspan, tomorrow, and you'll give us an update as well as Ms.

1525
01:56:41,360 --> 01:56:42,061
Knowles' attorney.

1526
01:56:43,042 --> 01:56:43,642
Yes.

1527
01:56:43,682 --> 01:56:44,503
Thank you very much.

1528
01:56:49,346 --> 01:56:51,548
Motion to revert to the regular order of business.

1529
01:56:52,329 --> 01:56:53,329
All those in favor?

1530
01:56:54,010 --> 01:56:54,130
Aye.

1531
01:56:54,250 --> 01:56:55,331
All those opposed?

1532
01:56:56,652 --> 01:56:59,614
We report on before and after school programs.

1533
01:56:59,854 --> 01:57:01,816
We call on our assistant superintendent to make this report.

1534
01:57:15,818 --> 01:57:18,861
Well, everybody take a breath.

1535
01:57:21,344 --> 01:57:33,096
So on a much lighter note, I'm pleased to announce the before and after school programs are up and running and have been since the very first day of school.

1536
01:57:34,478 --> 01:57:35,279
Informational

1537
01:57:36,079 --> 01:57:40,922
packets were sent out to all of our families at the end of the school year in June.

1538
01:57:41,843 --> 01:57:50,449
And if you look at the numbers from when the before school started in 2015-16, you can tell that we've grown.

1539
01:57:50,669 --> 01:57:54,311
In fact, I enrolled a few more people at the Brooks Elementary School.

1540
01:57:54,931 --> 01:57:56,893
So we're up to 57 children.

1541
01:57:57,453 --> 01:57:59,334
The Columbus is at 18.

1542
01:57:59,995 --> 01:58:01,636
The McGlynn School went up three.

1543
01:58:01,756 --> 01:58:02,436
They're up to

1544
01:58:04,297 --> 01:58:07,779
19 or 20 students, and the Roberts is up to 20.

1545
01:58:08,920 --> 01:58:17,445
We're actually looking for more teachers to take care of our kids in the morning because our before school program is growing.

1546
01:58:18,465 --> 01:58:28,391
I'd like to take this opportunity to thank Michelle Bissell, who is my administrative assistant, because she is always there to take care of our families, to teach them about the FACT system,

1547
01:58:29,019 --> 01:58:38,272
to give them the handbooks that I provided you with earlier this evening, as well as your continued support for our before school program.

1548
01:58:39,933 --> 01:58:56,040
I also spoke to Shelly Gross, who's in charge of the after-school program, and she feels the same way we do, that the families are grateful and appreciative that they have a program that the children can go to every day after school.

1549
01:58:56,760 --> 01:58:59,742
And it's wonderful that the children don't even have to leave the schools.

1550
01:59:00,462 --> 01:59:02,943
So it's from two to six in the afternoon.

1551
01:59:03,543 --> 01:59:05,364
On Wednesdays, it goes from 1.30 to six o'clock.

1552
01:59:07,183 --> 01:59:13,606
If you look at the numbers, the Brooks School was at 230 last year, and it's at 252 this year.

1553
01:59:14,167 --> 01:59:15,948
The Columbus School has increased by 10.

1554
01:59:16,048 --> 01:59:22,011
The McGlynn has increased by a few students, and the Roberts School has also increased.

1555
01:59:22,911 --> 01:59:32,617
We owe a debt of gratitude to Shelly Gross and Dale Savati and Kathy Hunt for all of their hard work in the after school program as well.

1556
01:59:33,377 --> 01:59:34,998
And I'm happy to answer any questions.

1557
01:59:35,790 --> 01:59:36,250
Thank you.

1558
01:59:36,350 --> 01:59:36,830
Thank you.

1559
01:59:36,910 --> 01:59:37,631
Thank you.

1560
01:59:38,031 --> 01:59:40,012
Motion to accept the report and place it on file.

1561
01:59:40,112 --> 01:59:41,392
Accept the report and place it on file.

1562
01:59:41,412 --> 01:59:43,013
I'll provide Mr. Skerry, seconded by Ms.

1563
01:59:43,033 --> 01:59:43,553
VanDekloot.

1564
01:59:43,633 --> 01:59:44,413
All those in favor?

1565
01:59:45,214 --> 01:59:46,034
All those opposed?

1566
01:59:46,414 --> 01:59:47,215
Motion passes.

1567
01:59:48,515 --> 01:59:52,337
Recommendation to approve amendments to electronic device utilization.

1568
01:59:52,357 --> 01:59:56,238
I'll call upon our deputy superintendent to address this issue.

1569
02:00:00,800 --> 02:00:02,281
OK, just last spring,

1570
02:00:03,873 --> 02:00:10,517
we developed and the school committee approved a policy related to the student use of electronic devices.

1571
02:00:11,417 --> 02:00:14,579
We would say cell phones, but it's more than just the cell phone these days.

1572
02:00:15,300 --> 02:00:18,702
The approved policy is attached in the report.

1573
02:00:19,702 --> 02:00:29,828
Upon further review, this kind of took place over the summer, high school administrators determined that one segment of the policy would be very difficult to enforce.

1574
02:00:30,569 --> 02:00:32,910
And this item deals with the student use of

1575
02:00:33,397 --> 02:00:38,219
cell phones or electronic devices in the hallways between the passing of classes.

1576
02:00:38,979 --> 02:00:42,840
The approved policy has very specific sanctions for violations.

1577
02:00:43,421 --> 02:00:51,023
We want to ensure that if we are going to impose sanctions, that we have the ability to do so consistently and equitably.

1578
02:00:51,083 --> 02:01:01,687
And the headmaster felt that we really didn't have that ability to be consistent and equitable in how we would treat violations.

1579
02:01:02,328 --> 02:01:10,951
So therefore, we're recommending that we amend the policy to allow for the use of the devices in the hallways during passing time.

1580
02:01:11,911 --> 02:01:30,438
And since students are not all necessarily in the cafeteria during lunch periods, the new amended policy speaks to the use of electronic devices during lunch periods in, quote, designated student areas, which would include, in addition to the cafeteria, the gym and the library.

1581
02:01:31,607 --> 02:01:41,051
We have also added some language that wasn't in there before that's specific to the needs of students on special education plans at all grade levels.

1582
02:01:41,911 --> 02:01:54,175
So based on the conversations with the administrators, we are recommending that the school committee replace the previous approved electronic device policy with the amended electronic device policy.

1583
02:01:54,576 --> 02:02:00,978
And if you look at the attached policies, the first one is the approved and

1584
02:02:01,543 --> 02:02:04,904
The main change comes in that first paragraph under the high school.

1585
02:02:05,604 --> 02:02:17,507
And then if you go to the draft of what we're asking in terms of an amended policy, you can see, I've kind of highlighted with arrows, the changes, okay?

1586
02:02:17,547 --> 02:02:28,970
So it would be in the first paragraph, and then as you go further down for the middle and the elementary school, it speaks to the use of these devices if they are in students' IEPs or their 504 plans.

1587
02:02:30,301 --> 02:02:38,867
And with this, I think it's something that we can enforce, and obviously, for special education students, it accounts for their special needs.

1588
02:02:39,928 --> 02:02:41,409
Miss Cuneo.

1589
02:02:44,117 --> 02:02:51,960
Looking over the changes, I have to be honest, the one that I don't mind any of the other changes, and I totally understand it.

1590
02:02:52,080 --> 02:02:55,322
I mean, I was on the site council when a lot of this was changing.

1591
02:02:57,182 --> 02:03:05,445
But the one I do have a hard time with, and I hear that students are doing it, whatever, so let's continue doing it.

1592
02:03:05,485 --> 02:03:07,426
But the rule was that you couldn't.

1593
02:03:07,566 --> 02:03:11,608
And that is, they may be used in hallways during passing time.

1594
02:03:15,209 --> 02:03:16,210
The hallways are crowded.

1595
02:03:17,450 --> 02:03:22,753
And having these students on their phones just trying to like go from one class to another plus being on the phone.

1596
02:03:24,074 --> 02:03:28,536
I mean, I get that they were, you know, you hear people say, well, they do it anyway.

1597
02:03:28,556 --> 02:03:32,118
Well, the fact remains is that they weren't supposed to do it in the first place.

1598
02:03:33,539 --> 02:03:36,640
That they may be used during the lunch periods in designated student areas.

1599
02:03:36,901 --> 02:03:41,503
I totally understand that because as you mentioned, not all students sometimes are in the cafeteria.

1600
02:03:42,003 --> 02:03:44,124
And they are in different places, and I get that.

1601
02:03:44,524 --> 02:03:53,428
I do have a problem with the one that the students could just be walking around during class time in between going from class to class and being on the phone.

1602
02:03:53,789 --> 02:03:56,450
And I also am worried about their safety issues, too.

1603
02:03:56,470 --> 02:03:58,951
I mean, going up and down stairs, I see it all the time.

1604
02:03:58,971 --> 02:04:00,532
I see adults doing it.

1605
02:04:00,712 --> 02:04:04,734
I mean, I'll be driving, and they're just walking and talking and not even paying attention to where they're going.

1606
02:04:05,194 --> 02:04:06,655
So I have to be honest.

1607
02:04:06,995 --> 02:04:11,457
The one about using it in the hallways during passing time, I have a problem with.

1608
02:04:11,797 --> 02:04:13,978
Mayor Burke?

1609
02:04:14,919 --> 02:04:15,739
Mr. Benedetto?

1610
02:04:16,059 --> 02:04:16,519
Thank you.

1611
02:04:17,520 --> 02:04:23,543
I was able to come to the parent information night for the freshmen and juniors last week.

1612
02:04:24,143 --> 02:04:29,686
And this was announced that it was happening up at the high school and for a couple of reasons.

1613
02:04:29,966 --> 02:04:32,607
And I agree with the change in the program.

1614
02:04:33,300 --> 02:04:39,103
First of all, you have hundreds of kids walking through the hallways at the same time, and they're going to have their phones out.

1615
02:04:39,504 --> 02:04:44,547
So you're grabbing one out of many that are doing it in the hallway.

1616
02:04:44,587 --> 02:04:48,289
So there's no consistency in trying to get them all to not use their phones.

1617
02:04:48,749 --> 02:04:50,250
Secondly, I feel like a lot of

1618
02:04:50,770 --> 02:04:54,472
Our newer students, they keep their calendar, I mean, their schedule.

1619
02:04:54,492 --> 02:04:55,913
They take a picture of their schedule.

1620
02:04:56,233 --> 02:05:01,937
And that's what they use so they're not going through the backpacks in the hallway and tripping other people trying to find their schedule.

1621
02:05:02,597 --> 02:05:09,041
Because they use their phone to get from, OK, which building am I going and what class am I in now?

1622
02:05:09,201 --> 02:05:10,662
And they pull it up on their phone.

1623
02:05:11,643 --> 02:05:19,247
Children today use electronics much more readily than ever before, and that's how.

1624
02:05:20,348 --> 02:05:29,453
They work everything, and there's people here tonight taking all notes of what's going on on their iPads, whereas I would probably have my pen and paper, which I did last week.

1625
02:05:29,653 --> 02:05:34,236
It's just a different generation, and we need to encourage them to use electronics.

1626
02:05:34,596 --> 02:05:38,438
As far as passing in the hallways, it's not when you're going to the bathroom.

1627
02:05:38,778 --> 02:05:43,781
It's only when the bell rings and you have those three to five minutes to get from one class to another.

1628
02:05:44,141 --> 02:05:47,884
It's like you can't leave class and go out in the hallway and use your phone.

1629
02:05:48,804 --> 02:05:51,185
That's when it will be enforced.

1630
02:05:51,306 --> 02:05:53,507
That's the explanation that I got the other night.

1631
02:05:55,388 --> 02:06:03,655
There were other questions that parents had that night, which I'd like to go over either with the headmaster himself or announce later.

1632
02:06:04,495 --> 02:06:07,398
That came out of, I took notes that people are asking.

1633
02:06:07,738 --> 02:06:11,581
Also, the students can go to the gym now at lunchtime, which I think is great.

1634
02:06:11,621 --> 02:06:14,563
And they're walking and they're doing different things.

1635
02:06:14,583 --> 02:06:21,028
They're playing basketball, so if kids need to blow off steam or need to move around, that's now allowed too.

1636
02:06:21,249 --> 02:06:22,470
There was a lot of progress.

1637
02:06:23,150 --> 02:06:28,376
in quality of student life, I felt like, and upgrades.

1638
02:06:28,576 --> 02:06:37,686
I went because my children have graduated so long ago, I thought it was important to see what it was like to be a parent going through the orientation process.

1639
02:06:38,226 --> 02:06:43,572
And, you know, there was a lot of new things being implemented that I didn't know about, and I learned a lot.

1640
02:06:43,993 --> 02:06:45,334
But I agree with

1641
02:06:46,503 --> 02:06:48,604
this new policy for electronics.

1642
02:06:49,525 --> 02:06:51,506
I believe kids are going to use them anyway.

1643
02:06:52,227 --> 02:06:55,450
And I believe that we can enforce this more equally.

1644
02:06:56,310 --> 02:06:59,573
And, you know, I think we should move forward.

1645
02:06:59,633 --> 02:07:01,334
And I make a motion to approve.

1646
02:07:02,715 --> 02:07:03,916
Can I speak as well?

1647
02:07:04,076 --> 02:07:04,737
Dr. Perrella.

1648
02:07:04,957 --> 02:07:05,638
Thank you.

1649
02:07:06,418 --> 02:07:09,060
I would agree wholeheartedly with Mr. Benedetto.

1650
02:07:10,421 --> 02:07:14,765
I would agree wholeheartedly with Mr. Benedetto for some of the reasons, but I'd like to also provide some context.

1651
02:07:16,019 --> 02:07:25,584
Like everything we do in public education, we have to reassess the practices and the techniques we utilize every single year, because things change dramatically, specifically in technology, of course.

1652
02:07:26,324 --> 02:07:43,012
So one of the things that we've been really wrestling with is how to address the growing omnipotence of cell phone technology, including technology on watches, on tablets, on small handheld computers, laptops, obviously, and they're everywhere.

1653
02:07:43,612 --> 02:07:50,874
And I would also like to echo Mr. Panandello that a lot of students use it as a calendar, as their appointments.

1654
02:07:51,514 --> 02:07:53,174
I know my children do that as well.

1655
02:07:53,695 --> 02:08:02,677
So we were faced with the task of trying to enforce a policy that we did not think, A, that it was something that was enforceable, and B, perhaps it was something that wasn't.

1656
02:08:03,349 --> 02:08:05,710
impacting public education on the education of students.

1657
02:08:06,110 --> 02:08:11,572
I did reach out to every single community in the area and not one community enforces this rule.

1658
02:08:12,132 --> 02:08:20,195
Many of them told me that we turn a blind eye but none of them enforced it and we'd rather have a frank conversation with students and teach them

1659
02:08:20,755 --> 02:08:29,202
the importance of technology and how to utilize it as adults, because we agree that adults are walking around with this technology, including the faculty members and myself.

1660
02:08:29,582 --> 02:08:34,246
I know I use my cell phone on a daily basis, walking through the halls, looking at emails and my schedule.

1661
02:08:34,706 --> 02:08:37,188
So we thought it would be a good opportunity for us to

1662
02:08:38,699 --> 02:08:57,387
address a small area, we're talking about three minutes a day, but in that, allowing students to do that in that period, we also have conversations with them about the importance and really the sacredness of instructional time, and that during classroom time, it's unacceptable to pull out your cell phone, just like it would be to attend a meeting as a professional.

1663
02:08:57,887 --> 02:09:00,208
Unless, of course, the educator allowed that to take place.

1664
02:09:00,749 --> 02:09:03,310
So these are the conversations we have with students on a daily basis.

1665
02:09:03,810 --> 02:09:11,594
Also part of our plan for the future is to address legitimate concerns with technology use and abuse by all of society.

1666
02:09:11,915 --> 02:09:14,696
There is an addictive nature to this and we want to discuss it.

1667
02:09:14,756 --> 02:09:18,158
We have intentions on utilizing advisories for these conversations.

1668
02:09:18,838 --> 02:09:21,719
We also, you mentioned the basketball court being opened.

1669
02:09:22,059 --> 02:09:27,780
Interestingly enough, not one cell phone's out in the basketball court, because we opened up a place for students to be active.

1670
02:09:28,140 --> 02:09:31,321
In the cafeteria, we do allow it, and most students are very quiet on how to utilize it.

1671
02:09:31,801 --> 02:09:35,902
I would recommend that anyone come to the school and look through the halls, especially school community members.

1672
02:09:36,222 --> 02:09:38,363
There's no change in behavior in the hallways.

1673
02:09:38,983 --> 02:09:41,604
It's not as if we're advocating for students to pull out their cell phone.

1674
02:09:41,904 --> 02:09:47,245
We're just addressing and allowing it to happen because we're being practical and we're trying to use it as an educational opportunity.

1675
02:09:49,291 --> 02:09:49,431
Ms.

1676
02:09:49,451 --> 02:09:49,934
Van De Kloot.

1677
02:09:51,120 --> 02:09:52,064
I appreciate your work.

1678
02:09:52,608 --> 02:10:12,071
Dr. Perillo, I have to say the only thing which is just, well, I have two different things that's just gnawing at me, and I'll vote to go along with this, but the other day I overheard a conversation between two parents, and one of them said, my son has already called or texted me six times, and it was only 10.30 in the morning.

1679
02:10:12,651 --> 02:10:20,253
And she said, I wish they wouldn't allow this, because it was clearly, where is that separation between child and parent?

1680
02:10:20,313 --> 02:10:21,993
And I see that as a growing,

1681
02:10:22,508 --> 02:10:38,469
concern, we talk about helicopter parents, we talk about, you know, kids, they're just, the advent of this ease in 24-7 technology has also meant for some kids not being as, gaining their independence.

1682
02:10:39,310 --> 02:10:39,770
And so I

1683
02:10:40,871 --> 02:11:02,945
And at my workplace where I supervise high school students, I know that there's been a real issue where it's been very difficult to say, nope, you can't use those cell phones when you're, oh yeah, pushing a patient or taking them, you know, and having to make strict lines, especially because there's other than employees walking through the halls on their cell phones.

1684
02:11:03,566 --> 02:11:10,010
And, you know, when you're in the kind of environment where I work, we need to impress upon

1685
02:11:10,600 --> 02:11:19,813
our students what's appropriate and they're just so used to having ready access that when that cell phone buzzes, they're thinking they can be there.

1686
02:11:20,153 --> 02:11:21,695
If I could respond to that first question.

1687
02:11:22,296 --> 02:11:25,300
I agree with you completely and I think it's a societal concern and issue.

1688
02:11:26,061 --> 02:11:26,622
It is also

1689
02:11:27,543 --> 02:11:36,550
I don't think it is reasonable to expect a school to make that stand in the hallways in an equitable manner, which is consistent, thanks to real concern.

1690
02:11:36,850 --> 02:11:43,675
But we also, I would like to emphasize that students are using their cell phones, even in schools that have a zero cell phone policy.

1691
02:11:43,695 --> 02:11:48,279
There's not a school, not a high school student that's not accessing their phone if they have one.

1692
02:11:48,539 --> 02:11:52,602
They leave the classroom, they go to the bathroom, they sneak it in every opportunity they have.

1693
02:11:52,978 --> 02:12:02,123
what we're having a change in the mindset of students is that we understand that, but there are certain times, sacred times, like classroom instruction, where it's completely unacceptable.

1694
02:12:02,183 --> 02:12:08,006
And like mentioned earlier, that includes going to the bathroom during classroom time.

1695
02:12:08,146 --> 02:12:11,288
So we truly enforce the hallways during classroom time.

1696
02:12:11,708 --> 02:12:19,673
It's that when you have 1,200, 1,300 students going to the halls, if you try to grab students' arms and left and right, you can imagine what kind of reaction you would get from that.

1697
02:12:19,933 --> 02:12:22,055
Yep, that shouldn't be the whole focus of your day.

1698
02:12:23,256 --> 02:12:24,197
So motion to approve?

1699
02:12:24,778 --> 02:12:25,118
Second.

1700
02:12:26,219 --> 02:12:26,439
Ms.

1701
02:12:26,459 --> 02:12:30,103
Cuno, on the motion, there's a primary and a secondary support for it.

1702
02:12:30,123 --> 02:12:31,164
I just want to clarify.

1703
02:12:31,324 --> 02:12:32,545
OK.

1704
02:12:32,686 --> 02:12:37,490
The clarification on this was that it wasn't that I don't know that things are changing.

1705
02:12:37,570 --> 02:12:42,575
You know me well enough that I've advocated a lot sitting at the meetings that we've had.

1706
02:12:43,016 --> 02:12:43,936
My concern is

1707
02:12:44,637 --> 02:12:53,322
If we're going to allow our students to use the phones in between classes, and if it's because of scheduling or looking at schedule because it's easier.

1708
02:12:53,702 --> 02:12:56,924
We all know our kids right now, they come out of the womb with the cell phones.

1709
02:12:56,964 --> 02:12:58,165
We know that happens.

1710
02:12:58,245 --> 02:13:02,447
And I'm not foolish enough to say that every child in the school does not use their phone.

1711
02:13:02,607 --> 02:13:03,608
I know that, I get it.

1712
02:13:04,108 --> 02:13:08,270
What I'm concerned with is when you're saying using the phone.

1713
02:13:08,770 --> 02:13:13,371
Are you saying that you're going to be using the phone and allowing them to take it out so they can know what class they're going to?

1714
02:13:13,752 --> 02:13:17,273
Some kids might even put a diagram so they know exactly where the classes are.

1715
02:13:17,333 --> 02:13:23,195
That's easier for them than the map we provide in the back of our handbook.

1716
02:13:23,815 --> 02:13:30,978
My concern is students walking around while they're trying to get their things out of the locker, and they're all walking around with their cell phones.

1717
02:13:31,098 --> 02:13:32,059
Yes, that's a good question.

1718
02:13:32,099 --> 02:13:36,243
To a clarification, students are not allowed to make phone calls in the hallways.

1719
02:13:36,683 --> 02:13:41,167
They're allowed to access their technology, which of course is also a cell phone.

1720
02:13:42,028 --> 02:13:55,820
We do not allow them, you know, part of the expectation, and this has been communicated in a few different areas, and it's continuous, this communication, is that students, if they have to make a phone call, they go to an office, we'll happily allow them to use the phone.

1721
02:13:56,200 --> 02:14:02,084
Also, they are not allowed to use headphones or listen to music during their hallway time either.

1722
02:14:02,404 --> 02:14:06,426
So it's not as if students have their headphones on or music is playing from their phones.

1723
02:14:06,746 --> 02:14:08,527
And this is part of the compromise we had with them.

1724
02:14:08,547 --> 02:14:12,830
We literally just had a discussion and treat them like adults and say, there are expectations we have.

1725
02:14:13,190 --> 02:14:17,433
And there are reasons for those expectations, for safety and for like reasons.

1726
02:14:17,833 --> 02:14:19,694
So these are also part of the changes.

1727
02:14:19,714 --> 02:14:23,696
And I believe that it was all communicated in parent information as well.

1728
02:14:25,217 --> 02:14:26,538
I think that has to be clarified.

1729
02:14:26,878 --> 02:14:28,979
Because when I said safety, that's what I mean.

1730
02:14:29,179 --> 02:14:35,341
When you're on a crowded staircase, and you're going down the stairs, and you're holding books or whatever, and you're making a phone call.

1731
02:14:35,381 --> 02:14:39,983
Because this does not say they may be used in a hallway during passing time only.

1732
02:14:40,924 --> 02:14:43,605
Excluding phone calls.

1733
02:14:43,765 --> 02:14:47,426
I'll give you a copy of the student handbook from Minton High School, which that is very clear.

1734
02:14:47,486 --> 02:14:50,628
If it says excluding phone calls, then I have no problem with it.

1735
02:14:50,648 --> 02:14:53,449
But if it doesn't say excluding phone calls, then there's a problem.

1736
02:14:58,317 --> 02:15:06,284
Dr. Perla, while you're here, I'm just going to take this opportunity to mention that the school committee has been without a student representative for a long time.

1737
02:15:06,944 --> 02:15:12,629
Over the course of years, occasionally we've had some students that we've done better or worse, but now for the last

1738
02:15:13,810 --> 02:15:18,651
last two years or more, we haven't had anybody, and certainly nobody consistent.

1739
02:15:19,251 --> 02:15:21,652
I think it's valuable when we get to a question like this.

1740
02:15:22,152 --> 02:15:37,875
This is when, while you've done an excellent job defending your position and explaining to us the rationale, which I certainly appreciate, but this is so much a question when we should have our student representatives present.

1741
02:15:38,315 --> 02:15:40,176
So I'm wondering if we could ask you to

1742
02:15:41,863 --> 02:15:46,105
explain to the students what the role is, explain that this is an opportunity for them.

1743
02:15:46,565 --> 02:15:50,826
We've had some great, you know, vocal people in the past.

1744
02:15:51,187 --> 02:16:00,010
We like hearing from the kids, and I'm wondering if you could help arrange that so that we could expect to have students on a regular basis attend our meeting.

1745
02:16:00,835 --> 02:16:02,216
I think it's a fantastic idea.

1746
02:16:02,396 --> 02:16:04,218
I'll have someone in place for the next school convening.

1747
02:16:04,819 --> 02:16:05,239
Thank you.

1748
02:16:05,299 --> 02:16:06,380
Well, someone who wants to come.

1749
02:16:06,560 --> 02:16:06,760
Yes.

1750
02:16:06,840 --> 02:16:09,923
I'm sure there are a lot of people who will force him.

1751
02:16:09,963 --> 02:16:11,164
We'll be up to help you.

1752
02:16:12,653 --> 02:16:13,514
Mr. Benedetto.

1753
02:16:13,954 --> 02:16:15,575
I'd love for you to hear them, by the way, as well.

1754
02:16:15,615 --> 02:16:21,378
I think you're going to hear the same message I'm giving you, that they're happy, they're excited about some of the changes, and being treated like adults.

1755
02:16:22,178 --> 02:16:26,461
If you do need us to come forward, and as Mr. Skerry said, to come recruit kids.

1756
02:16:27,201 --> 02:16:28,382
You're always welcome.

1757
02:16:28,402 --> 02:16:29,782
But there's always been a role.

1758
02:16:29,822 --> 02:16:30,823
There always is a role.

1759
02:16:31,263 --> 02:16:34,445
We've been to many other schools.

1760
02:16:34,465 --> 02:16:37,927
We now have them, and I feel like we're really missing out right now.

1761
02:16:40,001 --> 02:16:41,702
Mr. Benedetto has one last.

1762
02:16:41,822 --> 02:16:43,483
Thank you.

1763
02:16:43,963 --> 02:17:02,129
I also want to take this opportunity to let you know that there was a request at the meetings last week from parents to have more of meetings that are taking place up at the high school videotaped and put onto school brains or distributed to parents.

1764
02:17:02,769 --> 02:17:05,810
So because some people don't have

1765
02:17:06,485 --> 02:17:11,368
No, like the parent information, freshman and junior parent information night.

1766
02:17:11,868 --> 02:17:14,850
Some parents didn't have the availability to come to those meetings.

1767
02:17:15,310 --> 02:17:30,158
And now that we have the technology in this room, or any other, even awards, like not just award ceremonies, but informational things, or putting the PowerPoint presentations up.

1768
02:17:30,438 --> 02:17:31,519
I don't know if that's happened.

1769
02:17:31,539 --> 02:17:35,181
I know that there were administrators here and they did take those notes back to you.

1770
02:17:36,158 --> 02:17:37,559
But I thought I would express that.

1771
02:17:37,699 --> 02:17:41,682
And there was some concern about electives now being passed field.

1772
02:17:42,042 --> 02:17:46,044
And how that, they had questions about how that would affect students GPA.

1773
02:17:46,604 --> 02:17:48,806
So I know we're going to be talking about.

1774
02:17:49,499 --> 02:17:54,263
those type of things soon, and I just wanted to bring that to your attention.

1775
02:17:54,323 --> 02:18:06,353
First question, we have every intention to take advantage of the new technology present in this theater to present not only those meetings, but also the award ceremonies and things of that nature.

1776
02:18:06,373 --> 02:18:16,042
A lot of things that happen here that are exciting, and we share your assessment that it'd be a great tool, another tool for us to share information for people unable to attend those meetings.

1777
02:18:16,742 --> 02:18:17,163
Absolutely.

1778
02:18:17,897 --> 02:18:20,399
Mr. Tucci brought that information back to me and we thought it was a brilliant idea.

1779
02:18:21,140 --> 02:18:30,489
And in fact, the technology changes in this that are alone is fairly new to us, so we haven't really probably grasped the potential that it allows for.

1780
02:18:30,829 --> 02:18:33,412
The second question, the elective discussion.

1781
02:18:33,672 --> 02:18:36,735
There's a long list of reasons we presented this.

1782
02:18:36,795 --> 02:18:40,178
I'd be happy to share it with the school committee at some point.

1783
02:18:40,218 --> 02:18:42,841
I could give you a short summary of some of those points.

1784
02:18:43,441 --> 02:18:49,864
It's something that the directors and I who met throughout the school year thought it made the most sense educationally.

1785
02:18:49,964 --> 02:18:52,105
It does not impact a GPA.

1786
02:18:52,225 --> 02:19:05,991
One of the things we did was remove its impact on GPA because what we found is that students were not taking advantage of certain classes because of their own reasons because they didn't want to take that class because it would lower their GPA because it wasn't an AP or honors level course.

1787
02:19:06,571 --> 02:19:14,922
So our solution was to remove that so that we don't take away that concern so a student can take a tire and not feel bad that they're not keeping up with other students GPA wise.

1788
02:19:15,503 --> 02:19:18,347
As far as pass fill goes, probably the

1789
02:19:19,217 --> 02:19:22,159
belief was that we wanted to create a common experience for students.

1790
02:19:22,480 --> 02:19:27,804
What we found is there's a lot, a real range, a spectrum of courses with differing degrees of homework.

1791
02:19:28,164 --> 02:19:43,537
Sometimes some of the mini courses had more homework than some of the core courses, and as far as great expectations, and what we wanted to do is begin the discussion, really the conversation on how to create a common experience for our students in these really small, mini classes that they see two times out of a six-day cycle.

1792
02:19:44,294 --> 02:19:55,402
Okay, and another last is more notification before, like, guidance coffee hours, more than a week notice for parents so they can arrange things in their scheduling.

1793
02:19:56,042 --> 02:19:57,763
That was another thing.

1794
02:19:58,544 --> 02:20:10,492
Also, are we having an SAT informational session for, and you may not know this, Kathy DiMedaglio may not, for parents with disabilities about how

1795
02:20:10,982 --> 02:20:21,088
if they need extended time on SATs or PSATs, how parents or students with disabilities, is there a way to request that?

1796
02:20:21,608 --> 02:20:23,269
That was another question that came up.

1797
02:20:23,489 --> 02:20:27,112
I'm sure there's a way we could address that.

1798
02:20:28,753 --> 02:20:33,195
So I think the guidance department typically manages that.

1799
02:20:34,876 --> 02:20:36,537
Could you step forward, please?

1800
02:20:38,941 --> 02:20:42,323
So guidance does run those sessions that Kathy mentioned.

1801
02:20:42,363 --> 02:20:44,165
We could add a special ed element to that.

1802
02:20:44,245 --> 02:20:46,026
I think that's something that's reasonable.

1803
02:20:46,046 --> 02:20:46,086
OK.

1804
02:20:46,146 --> 02:21:00,556
And then each year during the college fair, there is a formal presentation where we have a representative from the college who comes out and talks about the whole college experience for them, and that includes applying for accommodations for us.

1805
02:21:02,477 --> 02:21:31,141
So some clarification may be needed for junior parents taking PSATs about who contacts College Board with a request, just on some information I saw recently distributed to parents, just in a spoken way, and some clarification about how you get your accommodations done and who actually calls the College Board, who presents the data

1806
02:21:32,248 --> 02:21:33,909
for that decision to be made.

1807
02:21:33,929 --> 02:21:33,970
Ms.

1808
02:21:33,990 --> 02:21:37,191
Modadly, could you step forward?

1809
02:21:52,260 --> 02:21:59,766
So beginning at age 14, each student begins a transition plan that evolves over time.

1810
02:22:00,627 --> 02:22:04,970
And one portion of that is the discussion around preparation for what happens after high school.

1811
02:22:05,470 --> 02:22:13,477
If a student's goal is to attend college, and if it looks like SATs may be required for entry into college.

1812
02:22:14,457 --> 02:22:23,022
then that whole process around applying for accommodations to take the SATs or SATs, that discussion begins at that point in time.

1813
02:22:23,603 --> 02:22:28,105
So somewhere around grade nine, that discussion takes place around accommodations.

1814
02:22:29,286 --> 02:22:39,552
We make it very, very clear that the IEP doesn't necessarily drive the exact accommodations that a student is eligible for when they take the PSATs or SATs or ACTs.

1815
02:22:41,353 --> 02:22:44,795
It's the testing group that decides what accommodations are approved.

1816
02:22:45,896 --> 02:22:51,939
But we do make sure that the students have the appropriate testing in place that they'll need to apply for the testing.

1817
02:22:52,440 --> 02:23:02,326
So we discuss with parents, grade 9, grade 10, grade 11, all of the entire process of what's needed to be in place in order to apply for accommodations.

1818
02:23:02,706 --> 02:23:09,370
So as the team lead for any junior parent who was, because we're all taking the PSATs for free this year.

1819
02:23:09,885 --> 02:23:12,647
because of a grant, if I'm correct.

1820
02:23:13,248 --> 02:23:20,353
So have all parents whose students have a 504 on IEP been notified?

1821
02:23:20,752 --> 02:23:28,240
that in order for their children to have accommodations, the school is, is the school providing the information?

1822
02:23:28,600 --> 02:23:31,483
So the teams discussed the need to apply for accommodations.

1823
02:23:31,523 --> 02:23:36,709
The guidance counselors actually helped the student to apply for the accommodations.

1824
02:23:37,069 --> 02:23:37,329
Okay.

1825
02:23:37,589 --> 02:23:40,492
So that should have taken place through the guidance department.

1826
02:23:40,793 --> 02:23:40,993
Okay.

1827
02:23:41,477 --> 02:23:48,463
So what I'm saying is that did not come out of the meeting the other night, and I think some clarification is needed.

1828
02:23:48,483 --> 02:23:48,964
OK.

1829
02:23:48,984 --> 02:23:51,446
Well, I'll talk to Amelia and find out what the timeline is for that.

1830
02:23:51,846 --> 02:24:02,816
But my sense is that that happens on an annual basis, and it's a rotating task that happens each year with the entire group of students.

1831
02:24:02,916 --> 02:24:08,521
So it could be that, I don't know, take a look maybe.

1832
02:24:09,935 --> 02:24:11,215
Somebody overlooks something.

1833
02:24:11,295 --> 02:24:13,896
There's a motion for approval by Ms.

1834
02:24:13,936 --> 02:24:15,836
Van de Kloet, seconded by Mr. Scurry.

1835
02:24:15,896 --> 02:24:16,917
Roll call vote, please.

1836
02:24:17,517 --> 02:24:18,177
Mrs. Cuneo?

1837
02:24:18,517 --> 02:24:18,737
Yes.

1838
02:24:19,157 --> 02:24:20,657
Mrs. DiBenedetto?

1839
02:24:20,937 --> 02:24:21,238
Yes.

1840
02:24:21,378 --> 02:24:21,978
Mrs. Kretz?

1841
02:24:22,298 --> 02:24:22,498
Yes.

1842
02:24:23,498 --> 02:24:24,238
Mrs. Mustone?

1843
02:24:24,418 --> 02:24:24,678
Yes.

1844
02:24:24,878 --> 02:24:26,319
Mr. Scurry?

1845
02:24:26,499 --> 02:24:26,739
Yes.

1846
02:24:27,219 --> 02:24:27,899
Mrs. Van de Kloet?

1847
02:24:27,919 --> 02:24:28,179
Yes.

1848
02:24:28,399 --> 02:24:28,819
Mayor Burke?

1849
02:24:29,039 --> 02:24:29,319
Yes.

1850
02:24:29,379 --> 02:24:31,080
Seven in the affirmative, nine in the negative.

1851
02:24:31,140 --> 02:24:36,141
The motion is adopted for the change in the electronics policy with the inclusion of that.

1852
02:24:37,282 --> 02:24:41,797
With the inclusion of the student handbook on not taking phone calls.

1853
02:24:45,494 --> 02:24:50,337
Next item before us, recommendation to approve revised school dress code policy.

1854
02:24:50,497 --> 02:24:53,820
There's a motion for approval on the floor by Mr. Carey.

1855
02:24:53,840 --> 02:24:55,761
Is there a second?

1856
02:24:56,942 --> 02:24:57,782
Sorry, Mr. Carey.

1857
02:24:57,802 --> 02:24:59,604
He's laughing because he knows.

1858
02:24:59,684 --> 02:25:00,144
I'm right here.

1859
02:25:00,164 --> 02:25:01,185
Sorry, I can't see you.

1860
02:25:01,245 --> 02:25:02,586
I can't.

1861
02:25:02,746 --> 02:25:03,726
You have too much light.

1862
02:25:03,766 --> 02:25:04,947
We have no light down here.

1863
02:25:04,967 --> 02:25:05,768
We have to just share.

1864
02:25:06,028 --> 02:25:10,711
So I just remember when the dress code came up between the Andrews and the McGlenn and how they were so different.

1865
02:25:12,252 --> 02:25:18,417
So in the handbook at the elementary, like every elementary has their own handbook, the two middle school have their own handbook.

1866
02:25:18,957 --> 02:25:28,425
Will this just be cut and pasted into it, or is this like an addendum to the part that it already speaks about the dress code in the different handbooks?

1867
02:25:29,576 --> 02:25:34,719
This policy, if you approve it, will be the policy that will be in all handbooks.

1868
02:25:35,120 --> 02:25:39,542
Let me just explain a little bit what we've done, and I will be brief.

1869
02:25:40,103 --> 02:25:50,029
Again, as you mentioned last spring, this discussion began because we saw that many schools had dress codes that were outdated.

1870
02:25:50,109 --> 02:25:57,294
The dress codes among the schools were inconsistent, and there was the request to bring consistency to the dress code issue.

1871
02:25:58,054 --> 02:26:07,864
And we began our work, the administrators began talking about this back in June at our meetings, and we finalized our discussions when we came back together in August.

1872
02:26:08,685 --> 02:26:12,429
The issue of dress code is very complex.

1873
02:26:13,129 --> 02:26:20,597
It's being discussed all around the Commonwealth, as you can see from the article that was in the recent Boston Globe.

1874
02:26:21,977 --> 02:26:29,501
Dress codes, I think what's not understood is that dress codes by law that are too specific or restrictive can be overturned.

1875
02:26:30,701 --> 02:26:38,365
The law, again, basically says that student dress must comply with reasonable standards of health,

1876
02:26:39,187 --> 02:26:46,570
safety, and cleanliness, and must not cause a distraction or disruption in the educational process.

1877
02:26:46,970 --> 02:26:47,610
And that's it.

1878
02:26:48,131 --> 02:27:02,936
So when people mandate that you all have to wear blue jackets on a certain day, anybody could challenge that because if it doesn't adhere to the state mandate, and that's what the state says, health, safety, and not disrupting the educational process.

1879
02:27:03,697 --> 02:27:06,818
So the dress code that we have developed, we feel, meets

1880
02:27:08,008 --> 02:27:16,735
the state law mandate, the mandate of the state law, yet it provides some specific guidelines for the different levels of school.

1881
02:27:16,775 --> 02:27:26,823
And again, this was done with input from the elementary principals, middle school and high school principals, and basically all the administrators working together.

1882
02:27:27,264 --> 02:27:36,471
So the first part of the dress code is what I call the umbrella clause that covers the state mandate concerning dress code that must be

1883
02:27:38,203 --> 02:27:44,225
adhere to health safety and not be disruptive to the educational process.

1884
02:27:45,025 --> 02:27:53,368
We also put a statement in that we are sensitive to cultural differences, but again, the differences must not violate the law.

1885
02:27:54,408 --> 02:28:00,910
The elementary level, after the umbrella statement, the elementary will add what they felt was specificity

1886
02:28:01,828 --> 02:28:13,494
Again, it stays within the confines of the law, but it does give more specific guidance to what would be considered to be safe dress for elementary shoes, things of that sort.

1887
02:28:14,274 --> 02:28:19,537
The middle and high school principals felt that the middle and high school one could be consistent.

1888
02:28:19,877 --> 02:28:24,759
They felt that the same specificity was applicable to both middle and high school.

1889
02:28:25,220 --> 02:28:29,562
So what we have here, if it's approved, will be a dress code for the entire

1890
02:28:31,280 --> 02:28:36,997
school district with at the elementary level the clause that deals with a sentence that

1891
02:28:37,355 --> 02:28:43,997
or the paragraph that deals with elementary specificity, but the middle and high school, they would add the middle and high school specificity.

1892
02:28:44,017 --> 02:28:44,717
So with that.

1893
02:28:44,737 --> 02:28:46,237
So the current ones are all getting removed.

1894
02:28:46,717 --> 02:28:47,137
I'm sorry?

1895
02:28:47,217 --> 02:28:49,178
The current ones are all being removed and this will be the same.

1896
02:28:49,198 --> 02:28:52,219
Well, this is not officially approved yet, but they would, once you approve it.

1897
02:28:52,299 --> 02:28:52,799
Once it is, yeah.

1898
02:28:52,819 --> 02:28:55,039
This would take the place of what's in place.

1899
02:28:55,059 --> 02:28:55,620
Got it, mm-hmm.

1900
02:28:55,980 --> 02:28:56,280
Okay.

1901
02:28:56,300 --> 02:28:56,600
Thank you.

1902
02:28:57,540 --> 02:29:00,221
There's a motion on the floor for approval by Mr. Scarry, Ms.

1903
02:29:00,261 --> 02:29:00,541
Cunha.

1904
02:29:03,524 --> 02:29:09,126
Because I don't know what was, I don't have it in front of me to compare what was on it before and what isn't on it before.

1905
02:29:09,726 --> 02:29:15,407
Now, I like the idea because we have discussed, we have to make sure that everybody is on the same page.

1906
02:29:15,807 --> 02:29:23,589
And I think it's important, especially when the kids are going from the middle school to the high school and to the elementary schools to the middle schools that everybody knows that.

1907
02:29:23,989 --> 02:29:28,450
I guess my thing, I was reading a few of these things and like anything else,

1908
02:29:29,831 --> 02:29:32,974
I know teachers have a lot to do and it's difficult.

1909
02:29:33,014 --> 02:29:36,438
And I know administrators have the same type of responsibilities.

1910
02:29:36,478 --> 02:29:44,526
The only thing I guess for me is that if we're implementing this, if we're putting it out there, we have to make sure that we abide by it.

1911
02:29:45,066 --> 02:29:51,132
So if we're putting it out there, that means everyone is going to abide by it and it's not going to be like, gee, I could go through this hallway.

1912
02:29:51,873 --> 02:29:55,655
And so and so doesn't see me, and I could go through the other hallway where I know someone's going to see me.

1913
02:29:56,115 --> 02:30:04,679
So I just want to make sure that everyone's on board with this as far as, it says here, I don't mean to pick on the high school, but I know it has been done in the past.

1914
02:30:05,059 --> 02:30:10,422
That if a student will be provided a school issued suitable item of clothing.

1915
02:30:11,222 --> 02:30:15,024
So I just want to make sure that everyone is on the same page with that.

1916
02:30:15,224 --> 02:30:19,946
And if we're looking at our students, we as adults have to be their examples too.

1917
02:30:20,986 --> 02:30:26,969
So I'm just putting it out there that everybody should be very well-weared.

1918
02:30:26,989 --> 02:30:37,553
If we're asking our students to wear certain clothing, then we ourselves should be wearing the same and not wearing one thing or saying one thing and showing the students something different.

1919
02:30:40,748 --> 02:30:43,970
On the motion for approval by Mrs. Scurry, seconded by Ms.

1920
02:30:44,010 --> 02:30:45,671
Vandekloot, roll call vote, please.

1921
02:30:47,052 --> 02:30:47,653
Mrs. Cuneo?

1922
02:30:47,853 --> 02:30:48,093
Yes.

1923
02:30:48,853 --> 02:30:49,794
Mrs. DiBenedetto?

1924
02:30:49,934 --> 02:30:50,174
Yes.

1925
02:30:50,474 --> 02:30:51,055
Mrs. Kretz?

1926
02:30:51,435 --> 02:30:51,615
Yes.

1927
02:30:51,935 --> 02:30:52,696
Mrs. McStone?

1928
02:30:52,916 --> 02:30:53,156
Yes.

1929
02:30:53,376 --> 02:30:53,997
Mr. Scurry?

1930
02:30:54,137 --> 02:30:54,357
Yes.

1931
02:30:54,537 --> 02:30:55,217
Mrs. Vandekloot?

1932
02:30:55,257 --> 02:30:55,518
Yes.

1933
02:30:55,598 --> 02:30:56,018
Mayor Burke?

1934
02:30:56,218 --> 02:30:56,458
Yes.

1935
02:30:56,598 --> 02:31:00,641
That confirms there is a negative approved revised school dress code policy.

1936
02:31:01,902 --> 02:31:06,565
Item nine, recommendation to approve revised student activity account policy and practice.

1937
02:31:07,251 --> 02:31:14,406
We're going to call on our Director of Administration and Finance to explain this revision mandated by the state.

1938
02:31:14,747 --> 02:31:16,411
There's a motion for approval by Mr. Skerry.

1939
02:31:18,308 --> 02:31:18,848
Good evening.

1940
02:31:18,948 --> 02:31:32,839
So just a matter of housekeeping and basically to revote the school committee's authorization to maintain student activity accounts at each of the schools.

1941
02:31:33,680 --> 02:31:44,648
In addition to that, the Department of Education also identifies the importance and need for a balance in what would be the checking account versus

1942
02:31:45,228 --> 02:31:48,949
the deposits and savings account.

1943
02:31:49,469 --> 02:32:09,136
So what we are asking for is a two-fold vote to reaffirm the Mass General Law recommendation for maintaining these student activity accounts that are created by and held with the treasurer's office at City Hall.

1944
02:32:09,876 --> 02:32:13,638
and to establish thresholds at each of the school levels.

1945
02:32:14,139 --> 02:32:24,985
And the thresholds were identified through reviewing actual utilization and dollar amounts that have transpired through each of the accounts.

1946
02:32:25,485 --> 02:32:28,327
So the request is looking at the

1947
02:32:29,047 --> 02:32:34,709
Checking account balances for each of the elementary schools to reach $5,000.

1948
02:32:35,049 --> 02:32:43,513
And at that point, the documentation will be provided for the sweep to replenish each up to that threshold.

1949
02:32:44,233 --> 02:32:52,216
The middle school amounts have a little bit more activity and more balances within their savings account.

1950
02:32:52,716 --> 02:32:55,317
So their threshold has been identified for $10,000.

1951
02:32:57,619 --> 02:33:04,544
As well as the vocational school for that $10,000 amount, which maintains their own checking account as well.

1952
02:33:05,344 --> 02:33:14,912
And the high school level would be $25,000 and noting that during high volume times, such as a spring when we have

1953
02:33:15,812 --> 02:33:28,215
proms and large dollar value items, that there is flexibility to request a one-time transfer and replenish above and over that based on what is available within their savings account.

1954
02:33:28,635 --> 02:33:35,057
So this is really to create these thresholds and re-establish those thresholds.

1955
02:33:35,617 --> 02:34:00,270
affirm our accountability for the student activity accounts and be able to reconcile both of these, their savings and checkings within each school itself and be able to provide the principals with more clear information as well as us to be able to monitor what's being charged in those capacities that are student-oriented in nature.

1956
02:34:01,203 --> 02:34:02,084
Very good, thank you.

1957
02:34:03,105 --> 02:34:09,470
So just quick, does the $25,000, is that really sufficient for the high school when I think about all the different class events?

1958
02:34:09,530 --> 02:34:13,333
I mean, I see the checks that are paid out and some of them are quite substantial.

1959
02:34:14,934 --> 02:34:16,835
Is that enough of a cushion to make sure that

1960
02:34:17,876 --> 02:34:29,405
So again, the intent is to have a replenish that would occur either monthly or biweekly rather than independent transfers.

1961
02:34:29,805 --> 02:34:31,206
So the $25,000 was identified with the

1962
02:34:36,270 --> 02:34:53,422
main secretary who monitors all the activity and it was determined that that would be a comfortable amount for items going through the regular course of the year and notably that we would need a larger amount in those high volume times such as the spring.

1963
02:34:53,902 --> 02:34:54,182
Okay.

1964
02:34:54,663 --> 02:34:55,023
Thank you.

1965
02:34:55,823 --> 02:34:58,886
On the motion for approval by Mr. Scaria, Mr. Benedetto.

1966
02:34:59,546 --> 02:35:05,210
I just want some clarification about exactly what accounts this is talking about.

1967
02:35:06,083 --> 02:35:24,655
Sure, so this is establishing a dollar amount that will be maintained within their checking account, their checkbook availability to process the checks for items related to student activities within their school that the principal has purview.

1968
02:35:25,036 --> 02:35:30,579
Okay, so those are accounts that the principal and the school district has, like not PTO accounts?

1969
02:35:30,660 --> 02:35:30,980
Correct.

1970
02:35:31,733 --> 02:35:42,564
Not any outside groups, not any friends of, this is just like clubs, like the robotics club up here might have an account.

1971
02:35:42,604 --> 02:35:54,736
Correct, so the high school has notably substantial different club accounts, whereas the elementary and middle schools have a few that go into a general account there.

1972
02:35:55,355 --> 02:35:59,180
So if they have an event and raise money, those funds go back in?

1973
02:35:59,200 --> 02:36:02,625
Are they kept separate for those groups?

1974
02:36:02,785 --> 02:36:03,005
Yes.

1975
02:36:03,466 --> 02:36:03,746
OK.

1976
02:36:04,267 --> 02:36:09,934
And any time they need to access those funds, they have the right to, no matter

1977
02:36:10,515 --> 02:36:14,579
Well, so long as there is availability within the account.

1978
02:36:14,679 --> 02:36:19,523
And so this process identifies a threshold up to a dollar value.

1979
02:36:20,083 --> 02:36:25,508
If they exceed that, we need to request the replenish to get back up to that dollar value.

1980
02:36:27,890 --> 02:36:29,191
Identify what was needed.

1981
02:36:29,391 --> 02:36:31,833
So for Clara picture can be audited as well.

1982
02:36:31,953 --> 02:36:32,413
Correct.

1983
02:36:32,533 --> 02:36:35,375
Plus we budgeted a certain dollar amount.

1984
02:36:35,395 --> 02:36:36,976
No, this is outside of the budget.

1985
02:36:37,056 --> 02:36:40,558
This is strictly fundraising student activity events.

1986
02:36:41,079 --> 02:36:47,323
I didn't know if that was including budgeted allowances for those outside activities.

1987
02:36:48,115 --> 02:36:51,178
On the motion for approval by Mr. Scarry, is there a second by Ms.

1988
02:36:51,379 --> 02:36:51,639
Kretz?

1989
02:36:51,659 --> 02:36:53,561
Do you have a question or a second?

1990
02:36:53,921 --> 02:36:54,422
Second.

1991
02:36:55,343 --> 02:37:00,408
Roll call vote, please, on the approved revised student activity account policy in practice.

1992
02:37:01,407 --> 02:37:02,027
Mrs. Cuneo?

1993
02:37:02,287 --> 02:37:02,507
Yes.

1994
02:37:02,747 --> 02:37:03,708
Mrs. DiBenedetto?

1995
02:37:03,828 --> 02:37:04,128
Yes.

1996
02:37:04,328 --> 02:37:04,948
Mrs. Kretz?

1997
02:37:05,208 --> 02:37:05,388
Yes.

1998
02:37:05,748 --> 02:37:06,449
Mrs. Mustone?

1999
02:37:06,689 --> 02:37:06,929
Yes.

2000
02:37:07,129 --> 02:37:07,769
Mr. Scurry?

2001
02:37:07,849 --> 02:37:08,109
Yes.

2002
02:37:08,269 --> 02:37:09,030
Mrs. Vanderpoot?

2003
02:37:09,070 --> 02:37:09,310
Yes.

2004
02:37:09,390 --> 02:37:09,870
Mayor Burke?

2005
02:37:10,030 --> 02:37:10,270
Yes.

2006
02:37:10,290 --> 02:37:12,091
7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative.

2007
02:37:12,131 --> 02:37:13,611
The policy is approved.

2008
02:37:14,291 --> 02:37:15,012
Thank you, Christine.

2009
02:37:16,552 --> 02:37:19,693
Report on school brain software and implementation.

2010
02:37:22,114 --> 02:37:30,857
So this report is a comprehensive report on how school brain software is implemented in the Medford School District during this

2011
02:37:31,313 --> 02:37:34,374
2016-2017 first full year.

2012
02:37:35,534 --> 02:37:42,296
We converted from the I-pass system, which was the system we used for multiple years, to school brains.

2013
02:37:42,696 --> 02:37:44,016
It was a major undertaking.

2014
02:37:44,756 --> 02:37:54,138
And it's still reasonable to expect that some bumps will be in the road as you make that kind of conversion, especially since there's many more complex elements to school brains.

2015
02:37:54,699 --> 02:37:58,660
And there's much more that the state expects us to keep track of than ever before.

2016
02:38:01,259 --> 02:38:09,962
The interaction between a management software package and the myriad of longstanding specific policies and practices doesn't get untangled overnight.

2017
02:38:10,922 --> 02:38:14,263
Overall, the school brain software system has been a major improvement.

2018
02:38:15,484 --> 02:38:21,666
Based upon our experience during year one, we are making adjustments that will address the issues that emerged in year one.

2019
02:38:22,386 --> 02:38:30,989
And there'll be certain policy decisions that we will have to make to avoid other concerns going forward, and I listed some for our consideration going forward.

2020
02:38:31,746 --> 02:38:34,567
Should a weighted GPA system be continued in any format?

2021
02:38:34,607 --> 02:38:36,908
A lot of places have discontinued it.

2022
02:38:37,508 --> 02:38:41,530
Should special awards for achievement be based upon GPA-related ranking?

2023
02:38:42,030 --> 02:38:44,391
Or are there other ways to make these determinations?

2024
02:38:45,972 --> 02:38:51,955
How can we allow optimum access to student records and still provide optimum privacy and security?

2025
02:38:51,995 --> 02:38:59,598
Because the more people that can use the records for good purpose also opens up the door for what they know about individuals.

2026
02:39:00,366 --> 02:39:05,129
How can we promote advanced student learning that is not driven by GPA style ranking?

2027
02:39:05,649 --> 02:39:13,314
There are other things, I referenced it in my opening remarks, that we want our young people to be able to do, and the GPA doesn't necessarily reflect that.

2028
02:39:14,275 --> 02:39:20,619
And how can we systematically increase parental participation in the communication opportunities offered by school brains?

2029
02:39:20,699 --> 02:39:26,683
Because it's not easy to get people to use a new system, which can be a little bit daunting at times.

2030
02:39:27,251 --> 02:39:31,294
But nevertheless, that's what happens when it gets complex, and there are a lot of things you can do with it.

2031
02:39:32,254 --> 02:39:40,079
So we're going to try to address many of these questions in the next few months as we seek to effectively assess student learning and properly value their achievements.

2032
02:39:40,820 --> 02:39:46,383
Now, the report that's attached was generated primarily by Curtis Tootin.

2033
02:39:46,964 --> 02:39:49,105
Curtis, are you in the room?

2034
02:39:50,006 --> 02:39:50,486
Yeah.

2035
02:39:50,546 --> 02:39:54,969
In conjunction with myself and other members of the administration to

2036
02:39:57,069 --> 02:40:03,694
give you some in-depth understanding of the strengths, weaknesses, and some of the issues associated with school brains.

2037
02:40:03,754 --> 02:40:04,694
And there's a lot of data here.

2038
02:40:05,455 --> 02:40:08,777
So I'm going to have Curtis go through some of it.

2039
02:40:09,458 --> 02:40:14,361
And I don't want to dwell on every item tonight because I think it's too long and too much in depth.

2040
02:40:14,421 --> 02:40:19,065
But I want you to get an idea of some of the strengths and some of the things we have to work on.

2041
02:40:19,665 --> 02:40:24,589
And the headmaster is here also to give you some feedback as to these types of issues.

2042
02:40:25,169 --> 02:40:26,010
So go ahead, Curtis.

2043
02:40:26,806 --> 02:40:27,366
Sure, thank you.

2044
02:40:27,386 --> 02:40:28,827
Nice to see you all.

2045
02:40:29,187 --> 02:40:39,912
I produced this report on July 14th, which was after a meeting on July 11th, where Roy had us in his conference room, a bunch of other administrators.

2046
02:40:40,112 --> 02:40:43,093
We just talked out our first year with School Brains.

2047
02:40:43,793 --> 02:40:45,354
And a number of different issues were brought up.

2048
02:40:46,454 --> 02:40:48,415
The report was asked for a summary.

2049
02:40:48,695 --> 02:40:52,337
So that's why it touches on so many different things, because the meeting was comprehensive.

2050
02:40:53,861 --> 02:41:04,015
After the first draft was produced on the 14th, there were a series of meetings after that, and different staff members collaborated on changing language here and there.

2051
02:41:04,375 --> 02:41:10,523
For example, it originally started as a SWOT analysis, which is a commonly used tool for assessing

2052
02:41:11,244 --> 02:41:12,144
systems operations.

2053
02:41:13,245 --> 02:41:16,066
So that's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.

2054
02:41:16,666 --> 02:41:21,668
But threats is something that maybe isn't an appropriate word in this situation.

2055
02:41:21,708 --> 02:41:23,049
Liabilities might be a bit more appropriate.

2056
02:41:23,089 --> 02:41:30,972
So edits to language, and like I said, it was a collaboration amongst a bunch of different staff members that I ultimately compiled.

2057
02:41:32,615 --> 02:41:36,897
The most recent meeting was between Roy and I to produce this printed report.

2058
02:41:37,098 --> 02:41:40,520
But I think you could look at this as an ongoing document.

2059
02:41:40,880 --> 02:41:45,122
I hope you look at each of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and liabilities.

2060
02:41:45,442 --> 02:41:49,305
And there's, at the conclusion, something that's recommended.

2061
02:41:49,385 --> 02:41:52,106
It's a process for following up on a SWOT analysis.

2062
02:41:52,166 --> 02:41:54,988
That is observation, orientation, decision, and action.

2063
02:41:55,108 --> 02:41:58,110
So you could think of each topic as an observation.

2064
02:41:58,470 --> 02:42:01,292
And then if a meeting or specific

2065
02:42:02,332 --> 02:42:03,813
I don't know, council.

2066
02:42:04,554 --> 02:42:08,857
If the council wanted to address specific issues, then you could address them in that systematic way.

2067
02:42:09,217 --> 02:42:13,521
So I hope it sheds light on what was, I think, still overall a very successful year.

2068
02:42:13,561 --> 02:42:17,324
There are obviously many more strengths listed there than anything else.

2069
02:42:17,424 --> 02:42:21,567
And I'm happy to take any questions you have at this time or during the rest of the year.

2070
02:42:22,248 --> 02:42:24,109
I could ask just one question from the Chair.

2071
02:42:24,789 --> 02:42:32,231
I believe in June it was a parent that came forward that had an issue with the ranking and the GPA for their daughter.

2072
02:42:33,451 --> 02:42:45,655
Have we analyzed that individual's case to make sure that all the information that went into school brains is included, everything from the prior system, to make sure it's fully accurate as a test case?

2073
02:42:46,596 --> 02:42:46,876
Yes.

2074
02:42:46,976 --> 02:42:51,017
The data is always being reviewed, and since that issue... But was it for that individual?

2075
02:42:52,373 --> 02:43:01,365
Yes, so we determined the error that that individual came to school brought to school committees attention and we have an understanding of how it happened and

2076
02:43:02,249 --> 02:43:14,413
And it's something that we can correct for in the first grading period of this year And that's really the time that things will ultimately be finalized and reset because yeah either controls in place For those types of mistakes, so was it a manual error.

2077
02:43:14,673 --> 02:43:15,814
It was a manual error.

2078
02:43:15,854 --> 02:43:28,918
It was one specific class got coded wrong and their GPA credit didn't appropriately coincide with their class ranking so it wound up with a discrepancy that affected that student and we've now

2079
02:43:29,558 --> 02:43:32,940
figured out what that was specifically so that specific problem will never happen again.

2080
02:43:33,440 --> 02:43:41,706
And then GPA is now under scrutiny and we know after a full year of using the system what to go into the first grading period with.

2081
02:43:41,866 --> 02:43:51,952
So does the burden lie on the student and or family to discover an error or are there checks and balances that can make sure that we do as much as we possibly can?

2082
02:43:52,372 --> 02:43:53,153
Nothing's foolproof.

2083
02:43:53,193 --> 02:44:16,048
We all understand that sure So teachers students they play the main role in finding errors because ultimately They're determining what a grade is and it's very common for a grade to get changed after a term period closes That happens all the time with students making up work people just updating data on a regular basis and

2084
02:44:16,535 --> 02:44:24,279
And that is a great culture to have, because it allows for students to make up work and correct any grades that might have hurt them.

2085
02:44:24,339 --> 02:44:29,381
But it also makes it tough for data management, because we're making these constant updates to student grades.

2086
02:44:29,901 --> 02:44:35,404
And every time that happens, the students then request for a GPA recalculation, and they're ranked to be adjusted accordingly.

2087
02:44:35,864 --> 02:44:40,386
So you wind up with a lot of different recalculations that haven't had

2088
02:44:43,582 --> 02:44:45,083
Like a real method behind it.

2089
02:44:45,363 --> 02:44:58,747
So that's something that we're going to be addressing with the first term grading period this year, where everyone will have those finalized grades and then a plan going forward for adjusting GPA and rank like I know that at the first parent info nights, it was made clear that

2090
02:44:59,267 --> 02:45:13,711
the GPA and rank would only be calculated and shared on the term grading periods, and we'll address specific circumstances, whether it's correcting errors, things like that, as needed, but it's just something that we're a lot more aware of now, so we don't see it causing a problem again.

2091
02:45:14,245 --> 02:45:14,986
Great, thank you.

2092
02:45:15,006 --> 02:45:16,527
I have a question.

2093
02:45:16,747 --> 02:45:18,208
Hi, Curtis.

2094
02:45:18,388 --> 02:45:32,880
I have a question, and this happened a few times last year, where what we experienced was a couple of different times, like each progress report and each report card, it wasn't the grade point average.

2095
02:45:33,480 --> 02:45:39,105
It was the grade that was completely wrong, and it was completely wrong on school brains.

2096
02:45:39,525 --> 02:45:49,371
And I'm not sure if it was because maybe somebody wasn't entering the grade or they needed some more training on how to use the school brains tool.

2097
02:45:49,911 --> 02:46:03,560
But when this occurred last year, it caused great stress and anxiety on the student, the family, and going back and forth between the administration and the teacher.

2098
02:46:04,540 --> 02:46:09,665
The student would get the report card or the progress report and the teacher was already gone for the day.

2099
02:46:10,265 --> 02:46:16,050
And the actual grade on the report card and progress report was wrong.

2100
02:46:16,390 --> 02:46:18,252
And it even had wrong comments.

2101
02:46:18,732 --> 02:46:21,715
So this happened to my own son.

2102
02:46:22,295 --> 02:46:23,436
and some friends of his.

2103
02:46:23,696 --> 02:46:26,459
And it was really concerning.

2104
02:46:26,479 --> 02:46:29,521
And it was just really, really upsetting.

2105
02:46:29,661 --> 02:46:32,484
And it caused great stress and anxiety on the students.

2106
02:46:32,944 --> 02:46:35,646
I mean, these students were B plus students.

2107
02:46:35,846 --> 02:46:43,292
And their grade showed as a failing grade on school brains and progress report because the grades were not entered.

2108
02:46:43,673 --> 02:46:51,079
So I just want to make sure that there's precautions in place for this first term because

2109
02:46:51,999 --> 02:46:55,740
It didn't happen consistently with one particular class.

2110
02:46:56,160 --> 02:47:03,102
It was just, you know, randomly this one, another one, and, you know, it was, you know, it wasn't reliable.

2111
02:47:03,282 --> 02:47:10,504
So, you know, you never knew if it was going to be accurate, and we had to back up our grades on paper and notebooks, and that was more reliable than

2112
02:47:11,264 --> 02:47:12,485
the school brains.

2113
02:47:12,505 --> 02:47:18,070
We kept track of every single grade and it was just a lot of record keeping that you have to do on your own.

2114
02:47:18,491 --> 02:47:23,295
So I didn't know if you have any plans in place for this first quarter coming up.

2115
02:47:23,703 --> 02:47:31,229
Yes, and the main way to address that issue is through training and making sure that teachers are able to use the system and input data effectively.

2116
02:47:31,689 --> 02:47:37,935
So when the first term grading period happened last year, it was every teacher's first attempt at using it.

2117
02:47:38,375 --> 02:47:40,997
And there were many errors put in the system.

2118
02:47:41,117 --> 02:47:46,862
So it took sometimes, and unfortunately for some students, a full year of getting things straightened out.

2119
02:47:47,282 --> 02:47:49,404
And then even towards final grading period,

2120
02:47:49,904 --> 02:48:00,108
There was a specific process that we didn't know how to account for when students changed classes mid-year, and it resulted in some terms counting as zeros as opposed to no credit.

2121
02:48:00,228 --> 02:48:06,790
So you had these students with very good grades winding up with failing grades just because of this one technical oversight.

2122
02:48:07,271 --> 02:48:13,913
So if there are any outstanding issues, they should know to contact the school because it's very straightforward to correct them right now.

2123
02:48:14,213 --> 02:48:18,475
But we have now, after a full year, learned what the do's and don'ts are.

2124
02:48:19,415 --> 02:48:28,287
with the progress report grading period, that'll be a great practice time for teachers because the steps to input grades are the same from progress reports to report cards.

2125
02:48:28,768 --> 02:48:34,816
So if people could have patience during that one upcoming grading period, then I know that we'll have term one all figured out.

2126
02:48:35,987 --> 02:48:45,281
And I know when it did happen, you were extremely helpful, and so was the assistant principal in issuing revised progress reports and report cards.

2127
02:48:46,243 --> 02:48:47,986
In fact, within the next day.

2128
02:48:48,346 --> 02:48:49,348
So I really appreciate that.

2129
02:48:51,170 --> 02:48:53,491
I just wanted to make sure it was on the radar.

2130
02:48:53,771 --> 02:48:54,751
Oh yeah, totally.

2131
02:48:54,771 --> 02:48:55,851
Because it's on my radar.

2132
02:48:56,332 --> 02:49:06,995
Yeah, and it's on the radar in time for even tomorrow night when the guidance department is talking with seniors about college information, like we have transcripts that are up to date with the records the way they should be.

2133
02:49:07,075 --> 02:49:08,795
All that stuff has been accounted for.

2134
02:49:09,416 --> 02:49:16,118
And it started this summer when we sat down after the 4th of July break and met to figure out what we needed to fix for 2017-18.

2135
02:49:18,739 --> 02:49:21,181
I just have one more.

2136
02:49:21,561 --> 02:49:32,130
And Curtis, I wanted to know if you could put something on the website or in the instruction booklet, because what I ran into last year was that there were block out dates where you can't access your grades.

2137
02:49:32,710 --> 02:49:36,153
And, and I had asked you, you know, why can't we see the grades?

2138
02:49:36,353 --> 02:49:38,195
And you can't quite remember.

2139
02:49:38,235 --> 02:49:39,936
I think it had something to do with contractual.

2140
02:49:39,956 --> 02:49:40,036
Yeah.

2141
02:49:40,656 --> 02:49:42,318
But I'm, don't recall.

2142
02:49:43,137 --> 02:49:56,281
So as I understand it, and people can clarify if I get it wrong, but per the teacher's contract, the grades and specifically the term grades are not available to students and parents.

2143
02:49:56,861 --> 02:49:59,842
And the thinking behind that is teachers are catching up

2144
02:50:00,202 --> 02:50:17,807
on a term worth of grading at that time, and as they're entering data into the system, maybe they don't enter things completely, and they don't want students to get misled with bad data, so they take the access away, and then report cards are produced with their fully entered grade books.

2145
02:50:19,627 --> 02:50:38,025
There's another side of the argument where you could say, oh, they should have access all the time, but then I think you'd wind up in situations where people see inaccurate information or even more inaccurate information, and it would result in more issues as opposed to, you know, the unfortunate surprise that might come when two weeks of not being able to view a term grade results in a surprising report card.

2146
02:50:38,365 --> 02:50:40,947
So it's kind of a balance we're figuring out how to strike.

2147
02:50:42,709 --> 02:50:44,791
It's important to everyone understand

2148
02:50:45,336 --> 02:51:04,052
We are in an age where there are so many data points that are now being collected, and so much information that has to be cross-validated between student information, teacher licensure, course selection, student discipline, across the board, and it's all getting reported in, and it's cross-validating.

2149
02:51:04,572 --> 02:51:14,060
And as a result, the need to be precise has been exponentially created, so therefore,

2150
02:51:14,631 --> 02:51:18,654
You know, there's a lot of learning to go on as people want more and more data.

2151
02:51:19,174 --> 02:51:24,618
So it takes a period of time for everyone to get used to it and also to be diligent about it.

2152
02:51:25,399 --> 02:51:29,322
You can't go into it and say, Oh, well, three weeks ago I should have made that change.

2153
02:51:29,342 --> 02:51:30,482
You've got to do it when it happens.

2154
02:51:31,123 --> 02:51:34,405
So it's a process in the long run.

2155
02:51:34,425 --> 02:51:36,727
It'll work out in the short run.

2156
02:51:36,747 --> 02:51:40,750
There'll be a few bumps in the road and there'll be a few situations where some people aren't as

2157
02:51:41,705 --> 02:51:47,568
diligent or as good at doing it, but we'll continue to stay on it.

2158
02:51:47,608 --> 02:51:48,288
Mr. Benedetto.

2159
02:51:48,368 --> 02:51:48,788
Thank you.

2160
02:51:48,988 --> 02:51:50,189
I have two part questions.

2161
02:51:50,329 --> 02:52:09,177
First of all, I want to make sure that, um, the glitch in the system for that particular student didn't, um, have any effect on her applying to any colleges or her or class ranking or any longterm things.

2162
02:52:09,277 --> 02:52:11,218
So I don't know if you know that information.

2163
02:52:11,890 --> 02:52:26,643
or if the headmaster knows, if that was, you know, like if she's already applied, you know, early decision in first quarter is a little late for that GPA to be changed or that class ranking to change, is that going to affect her in any adverse way?

2164
02:52:27,624 --> 02:52:34,550
So I just want someone to follow up and make sure that that's not the case and that we don't need to fix it prior to the end of first quarter grades.

2165
02:52:36,735 --> 02:52:47,400
So that has been corrected, their GPA, and like Mr. Tudin just mentioned, the most critical time period for correct GPAs is for the fall for students applying for college.

2166
02:52:47,900 --> 02:52:50,141
That's when the actual application tends to go in.

2167
02:52:51,945 --> 02:52:55,107
So in that case, it won't impact the GPA.

2168
02:52:55,287 --> 02:52:58,529
So I don't see that as being an issue for her in that process.

2169
02:52:58,969 --> 02:52:59,429
All right, great.

2170
02:52:59,529 --> 02:52:59,909
Thank you.

2171
02:53:00,570 --> 02:53:01,690
The second part of my question.

2172
02:53:01,710 --> 02:53:03,291
One last thing about the first part of the question.

2173
02:53:04,031 --> 02:53:10,715
So ultimately, transcripts are what we really work towards getting 100% correct, because they're the permanent records.

2174
02:53:10,975 --> 02:53:14,877
And as I said before, data is constantly changing during the school year.

2175
02:53:15,037 --> 02:53:17,138
So adverse effects.

2176
02:53:18,627 --> 02:53:20,569
really play out in terms of the accuracy of that data.

2177
02:53:20,629 --> 02:53:27,254
So I definitely regret how we've learned about the problems from last year, but we have corrected that one student's issue.

2178
02:53:27,414 --> 02:53:30,777
And the transcripts, which is the final record, is accurate.

2179
02:53:31,305 --> 02:53:31,545
Thanks.

2180
02:53:31,885 --> 02:53:32,405
That's great.

2181
02:53:32,445 --> 02:53:33,726
I'm glad it was all resolved.

2182
02:53:34,346 --> 02:53:35,807
And that's what I just wanted to make sure.

2183
02:53:36,927 --> 02:53:40,688
So the second part of my question is more for the superintendent.

2184
02:53:41,248 --> 02:53:43,649
So I just want clarification.

2185
02:53:44,009 --> 02:53:51,572
With the new key teacher contract, what is the expectation of how often and how quickly

2186
02:53:52,392 --> 02:53:59,657
And how much data teachers are required to put in in the use of school brains or provide training.

2187
02:53:59,977 --> 02:54:03,880
Like homework assignments, are they being posted daily?

2188
02:54:04,520 --> 02:54:12,746
I don't know exactly what the new contract says and I'm just curious what their obligation is and how that's affecting our teaching staff.

2189
02:54:15,712 --> 02:54:20,155
So I know the term in the teacher contract is regular updates.

2190
02:54:20,175 --> 02:54:22,496
So the definition of regular is always open to interpretation.

2191
02:54:23,617 --> 02:54:34,284
My general rule of thumb when I'm training teachers in the system is two weeks of regular updates gives you multiple times logging in, checking data between grading periods.

2192
02:54:35,745 --> 02:54:51,004
Emphasizing the importance of double checking and making sure things are accurate for those grading periods is my definition of regular, but it's a culture change across the school, so people are working to figure out what the best practice is.

2193
02:54:51,224 --> 02:54:54,388
So my question's more directed to the superintendent.

2194
02:54:54,765 --> 02:55:05,929
like what's the expectation of parents using only school brains and to use that as homework assignments and that way of communication with parents.

2195
02:55:06,349 --> 02:55:16,312
If they need to send an email, they do it through the school brain so the teacher becomes more, it becomes more of a habit for the teacher as well as the parents to utilize this new system.

2196
02:55:16,752 --> 02:55:23,815
So it's the first go-to for everybody because I know that in prior years to having school brains,

2197
02:55:24,255 --> 02:55:30,137
Parents were saying, for three different children in the district, they would have three different ways to communicate with parents.

2198
02:55:30,517 --> 02:55:33,779
So I want to know what the expectations are from our teachers.

2199
02:55:33,859 --> 02:55:45,223
Now that we've had it a whole year, for this school year, what are we expecting our teachers to do and how often to post important information to parents?

2200
02:55:46,923 --> 02:55:50,225
Is this the only way that we're expecting them to do that?

2201
02:55:51,852 --> 02:55:58,978
So when we negotiated the last contract, this was one of the items that was specified in the contract.

2202
02:55:59,838 --> 02:56:07,585
And the teachers obviously indicated that they didn't want to be putting stuff in every day and so on and so forth in different levels.

2203
02:56:08,005 --> 02:56:14,230
For example, the elementary school didn't really apply as much, with much more broad based information.

2204
02:56:14,910 --> 02:56:18,213
At the middle and high school, probably once a week.

2205
02:56:18,610 --> 02:56:22,651
Every couple weeks that they would update that material, that was sort of the way they were thinking.

2206
02:56:23,171 --> 02:56:30,853
And towards the end of the quarter again, there would be some of the drop off from that because they were concentrating on consolidating the grades.

2207
02:56:31,433 --> 02:56:38,434
But I'll do some talking to some teachers and get a sense and get you another report because I think it's something that's going to grow.

2208
02:56:38,994 --> 02:56:42,875
Because people will use so many different systems for so long, they're comfortable with those.

2209
02:56:43,545 --> 02:56:44,746
And now they're switching to this.

2210
02:56:45,606 --> 02:56:51,549
And we've also got to get parents to really use it because you can't motivate someone to use something if no one is looking at it.

2211
02:56:52,289 --> 02:56:54,710
So we've got to find a way to bring them both together.

2212
02:56:55,431 --> 02:56:57,111
And I think that's sort of where we're coming from.

2213
02:56:57,151 --> 02:57:03,354
But overall, it's the right direction to head in, albeit it's not a perfect system.

2214
02:57:04,315 --> 02:57:11,498
So this was part of the reasoning for going with the new system was to consolidate

2215
02:57:12,002 --> 02:57:14,323
So parents didn't have to go to three places.

2216
02:57:14,403 --> 02:57:21,207
And that's the ultimate goal for the district K-12, and even preschool.

2217
02:57:21,787 --> 02:57:27,550
So I would like to stop people on that, especially in our early grades, and build straight through.

2218
02:57:27,930 --> 02:57:32,353
So I do think that it does affect our elementary teachers.

2219
02:57:32,433 --> 02:57:38,836
If they're assigning homeworks, and parents can go on at night and just check and say, oh, you forgot tomorrow is

2220
02:57:39,367 --> 02:57:42,166
you get to bring your special thing and do it at show and tell.

2221
02:57:42,577 --> 02:57:43,958
So let's pick it out now.

2222
02:57:44,338 --> 02:57:51,062
So I think it's an important tool that everyone in the district is consistent throughout the district, every school district.

2223
02:57:51,102 --> 02:58:05,691
So if you could talk to your principals and your leaders throughout the district and really at their meetings with their teachers, tell them that this is what the expectations are moving forward.

2224
02:58:05,831 --> 02:58:11,394
So that way, even in our preschool K classes, those teachers are using this.

2225
02:58:11,770 --> 02:58:13,173
all the way through our seniors.

2226
02:58:14,436 --> 02:58:15,859
If I could speak to that a bit too.

2227
02:58:16,661 --> 02:58:19,127
I think it's very important to you.

2228
02:58:20,700 --> 02:58:25,121
understand the massive culture change that is taking place in regards to that.

2229
02:58:25,501 --> 02:58:31,323
In the previous years, most teachers used a wide variety of systems for grading.

2230
02:58:31,903 --> 02:58:49,488
So what we have been doing, at least at the high school I can speak to, is that we've been making a focus of our unit discussions, evaluation discussions, and just building expectations that we are all using this system now to communicate and to regularly update grades on, like Mr. Tood mentioned, a regular basis.

2231
02:58:50,128 --> 02:58:58,617
It is part of our expectation, it's part of our conversation, and I think you'll see a significant change this time next year.

2232
02:58:58,637 --> 02:59:03,302
So is our other areas of the district doing that?

2233
02:59:03,823 --> 02:59:03,983
Ms.

2234
02:59:04,003 --> 02:59:08,668
Caldwell, is your area doing that as well as the middle schools?

2235
02:59:09,038 --> 02:59:11,599
Like I want consistency K through 12.

2236
02:59:11,679 --> 02:59:13,440
I don't just want the high school to use it.

2237
02:59:14,260 --> 02:59:22,463
I want, if I have a fourth grader and a second grader and an eighth grader and a kid graduating, I want to go into one system.

2238
02:59:22,483 --> 02:59:24,984
Good evening again.

2239
02:59:25,484 --> 02:59:31,126
So contractually, the elementary grades have to put in attendance and report cards only.

2240
02:59:32,655 --> 02:59:37,081
We do have a new contract coming up, so we may be able to negotiate something else.

2241
02:59:37,501 --> 02:59:41,166
But according to the teacher's contract, it is just attendance and report cards.

2242
02:59:41,667 --> 02:59:48,996
Can we encourage people to start using it in this fashion because of a request from parents?

2243
02:59:49,377 --> 02:59:51,159
Because that's what we're hearing through the district?

2244
02:59:51,960 --> 02:59:59,706
I'd like to have a further conversation with you about the parents, but yes, certainly we can ask our teachers to put in as much as possible.

2245
02:59:59,966 --> 03:00:06,991
I haven't heard as much of it recently, but when we were deciding on this program, I did hear

2246
03:00:08,413 --> 03:00:16,242
many Facebook messages from parents telling me how important that was and how frustrating it was in the evenings, trying to figure out.

2247
03:00:16,262 --> 03:00:24,692
We find that at the elementary level, we do a lot more when we meet with parents one-on-one in person, that it just makes a bigger difference to them.

2248
03:00:24,772 --> 03:00:27,596
But certainly, we can encourage our teachers to go online.

2249
03:00:28,136 --> 03:00:28,956
Okay, thank you.

2250
03:00:29,437 --> 03:00:29,617
Ms.

2251
03:00:29,637 --> 03:00:30,157
Van de Koot.

2252
03:00:31,838 --> 03:00:34,379
I had a couple of first nuts and bolts questions.

2253
03:00:35,099 --> 03:00:47,505
You listed in your report Curtis liabilities and one of them was notification of rights and suggested that this could be easily resolved by adding a message to the school brains login screen.

2254
03:00:47,545 --> 03:00:48,185
Has that been done?

2255
03:00:49,457 --> 03:00:51,000
So that hasn't been done.

2256
03:00:51,240 --> 03:00:55,767
The report was just produced on Friday, so it's something that we can address tomorrow.

2257
03:00:56,107 --> 03:01:00,975
It's very easy to... Then it would just seem that we should try and take these liabilities off.

2258
03:01:01,516 --> 03:01:04,941
Another one was the current ad hoc method of assigning user security roles.

2259
03:01:05,361 --> 03:01:11,226
is unsustainable and may expose sensitive information.

2260
03:01:11,927 --> 03:01:16,370
So I would think that that would be another one that we would need to spend some time on.

2261
03:01:17,631 --> 03:01:20,974
The data storage, I understand, being an issue.

2262
03:01:21,454 --> 03:01:23,055
So those are kind of nuts and bolts issues.

2263
03:01:23,075 --> 03:01:25,898
Since you've identified them, I'd like to try and resolve them.

2264
03:01:26,434 --> 03:01:33,700
The bigger issue that is also brought up in this report is the whole GPA system and the weighting of courses.

2265
03:01:33,760 --> 03:01:39,684
And I think that's a much larger conversation than certainly any of us have the wherewithal tonight.

2266
03:01:40,565 --> 03:01:51,073
I think that should probably happen within the course of meetings and probably in the curriculum subcommittee, perhaps, if my colleagues thought so as well.

2267
03:01:51,463 --> 03:02:13,084
I think that there's a lot of input we need to get and a lot of information for all of those questions which were presented to us, really saying is that the best possible way to go in the future to determine student achievement and how we emphasize that, how we tell schools, colleges, when kids are applying,

2268
03:02:13,732 --> 03:02:14,932
what sort of student this is.

2269
03:02:15,372 --> 03:02:21,474
It also goes on and says, you know, how do we give out awards and is it based on GPA or is it based on other stuff?

2270
03:02:21,734 --> 03:02:23,414
So a lot of information in that.

2271
03:02:24,054 --> 03:02:33,316
And something that I would suggest that we send to the curriculum subcommittee, which is my subcommittee, and ponder and work on that over some period of time this year.

2272
03:02:34,176 --> 03:02:34,797
Very good.

2273
03:02:34,957 --> 03:02:35,217
Great.

2274
03:02:35,237 --> 03:02:35,317
Ms.

2275
03:02:35,337 --> 03:02:35,837
Mustone.

2276
03:02:37,946 --> 03:02:38,827
I just had a question.

2277
03:02:38,867 --> 03:02:53,462
I was surprised at the under the behavior system that all the information now that we have at our fingertips that there were 278 suspensions and I was just hoping you could give me a report at some time in the near future if that's

2278
03:02:54,482 --> 03:03:00,365
One student who may have been suspended 10 times, or that's 270 individual students that were suspended once.

2279
03:03:00,425 --> 03:03:01,485
I was just surprised at that number.

2280
03:03:01,505 --> 03:03:01,585
Sure.

2281
03:03:01,665 --> 03:03:05,186
Yeah, there's a detailed report called the School Safety and Discipline Report.

2282
03:03:05,307 --> 03:03:08,268
It's something that's annually reported that has everything broken down.

2283
03:03:08,328 --> 03:03:11,549
So the summary reports are all available online.

2284
03:03:11,769 --> 03:03:14,990
I'd say send me a message, and we can figure out the details of what you're most interested in.

2285
03:03:15,050 --> 03:03:20,032
But I can say that that number has been drastically reduced over the years.

2286
03:03:20,192 --> 03:03:21,453
So that's a great sign for the district.

2287
03:03:21,973 --> 03:03:23,334
Yeah, I don't even know where it's right.

2288
03:03:23,374 --> 03:03:25,436
I know the number itself jumps out at you.

2289
03:03:25,456 --> 03:03:28,798
But if you look at it over time, it's something that we're doing continually better on.

2290
03:03:28,878 --> 03:03:32,801
But to get more into the weeds is a conversation.

2291
03:03:33,782 --> 03:03:34,182
Thank you.

2292
03:03:34,763 --> 03:03:34,963
Ms.

2293
03:03:35,003 --> 03:03:35,443
Cuno.

2294
03:03:36,004 --> 03:03:36,384
Thank you.

2295
03:03:39,385 --> 03:03:44,410
I just don't actually went upon that one, but I'm concerned about the GPA.

2296
03:03:44,450 --> 03:03:53,620
And as my colleagues just mentioned it, I think that the GPA part of this really needs to be, we need to sit down, clarify it.

2297
03:03:54,080 --> 03:04:02,269
This is a huge impact on parents and students on both ends, whether your GPA is high or low or in the middle.

2298
03:04:03,169 --> 03:04:11,711
We really need to clarify it because, I mean, I was reading this and I totally understand on certain things, but I don't want to go from one extreme to another.

2299
03:04:12,612 --> 03:04:26,475
And we're saying that we're not going to maybe do the GPA the way it is, but it's important for parents to understand, is this something that's going to impair our students that are going to go on to higher education?

2300
03:04:26,969 --> 03:04:35,460
I don't want parents thinking that if we're going to change our system, it's going to impair their children when they go off to college.

2301
03:04:36,031 --> 03:04:37,893
If we're all on the same page, that's great.

2302
03:04:38,413 --> 03:04:42,376
But I just don't want to turn around now and hear, OK, we're going to be doing it in one way.

2303
03:04:42,817 --> 03:04:45,979
And then they go to apply in a totally different way.

2304
03:04:46,019 --> 03:04:54,846
I mean, with all due respect and everything, I'm looking at this, and it says, you know, problems with the GPA are concerns of high-achieving students and their parents.

2305
03:04:55,287 --> 03:05:02,913
Time spent resolving them is time spent not helping the school's lower-achieving students who already don't value GPA.

2306
03:05:05,723 --> 03:05:14,147
I don't want that message to go out thinking that we're only going to be now concentrating on one group rather than concentrating on all the groups.

2307
03:05:14,627 --> 03:05:19,549
And it's just as important it is to make sure that our educational gap gets closer.

2308
03:05:19,569 --> 03:05:28,633
I want to make sure that we put out the correct information and that we're doing the correct thing of making it closer, not just changing the GPA.

2309
03:05:29,533 --> 03:05:37,538
I know the next thing that's going to come out of this, if people start reading it, and students start reading it, we're going to be almost in the same situation of what Ms.

2310
03:05:37,578 --> 03:05:42,100
Kretz said at the beginning of this meeting, and that is, what does that mean?

2311
03:05:42,181 --> 03:05:44,082
Are we going to start taking away valedictorians?

2312
03:05:44,162 --> 03:05:45,863
Are we going to start taking away certain things?

2313
03:05:46,403 --> 03:05:49,044
And if that's the case, and if that is a culture that

2314
03:05:50,165 --> 03:05:59,270
this school and this district is going to do, it has to be very important that we clarify it and we disclose it and we are transparent about it.

2315
03:05:59,650 --> 03:06:04,693
Because I don't want to get a phone call in May saying, guess what, in June we're not going to have it.

2316
03:06:05,213 --> 03:06:14,678
If that's something that's going to be discussed across this district, and more importantly with the students in this school, I want to make sure that they are very much aware of where we're going to go with this.

2317
03:06:15,058 --> 03:06:17,900
And I think as a school committee, we definitely want to know.

2318
03:06:18,760 --> 03:06:21,321
how we're going to achieve this.

2319
03:06:21,761 --> 03:06:31,185
So- I would say that it's in the purview of the school committee to set the policy, because all of the GPA issues are set according to the student handbook, which is up to this group to decide.

2320
03:06:31,205 --> 03:06:32,846
So I look forward to all those discussions.

2321
03:06:32,866 --> 03:06:33,326
It'll be great.

2322
03:06:33,586 --> 03:06:33,826
Okay.

2323
03:06:34,126 --> 03:06:36,527
So, and when we do have- Ms.

2324
03:06:36,647 --> 03:06:40,269
Vandekloot suggested that we send this paper to the subcommittee on curriculum.

2325
03:06:40,329 --> 03:06:40,909
Absolutely.

2326
03:06:41,169 --> 03:06:42,149
And definitely have it open.

2327
03:06:43,850 --> 03:06:47,693
Are you going to also have a discussion with parents once this is done?

2328
03:06:48,053 --> 03:06:48,974
Can I jump in too?

2329
03:06:49,434 --> 03:06:52,716
So I'd like to just clarify that there's a difference here in the GPA discussion.

2330
03:06:52,856 --> 03:06:56,499
One is obviously is accuracy, and that's critical for us.

2331
03:06:56,999 --> 03:07:04,024
I think there are many excellent points that Kouros brings up with his GPA reflection piece, things to ponder.

2332
03:07:04,304 --> 03:07:07,406
It is not necessarily what we're advocating as a building.

2333
03:07:07,586 --> 03:07:13,490
I think Kouros is brainstorming and being very creative in how he approaches the situation he's viewing.

2334
03:07:14,172 --> 03:07:18,454
So we're not in the process right now of changing GPA to that degree.

2335
03:07:18,474 --> 03:07:20,275
So I just want to make sure that it's clear.

2336
03:07:21,636 --> 03:07:24,477
I think there's two different pieces here in that report.

2337
03:07:24,817 --> 03:07:31,461
Well, and that's exactly what I'm saying, that if parents start reading this, they're going to jump to conclusions.

2338
03:07:31,881 --> 03:07:34,402
And I don't want parents to have the fear out there.

2339
03:07:34,762 --> 03:07:39,325
And I don't want the students to have the fear out there, no matter which group or subgroup they're in.

2340
03:07:39,785 --> 03:07:43,547
And that's why I said it's very important that we do discuss this the proper way.

2341
03:07:43,767 --> 03:07:46,309
And not starting rumors out there.

2342
03:07:46,529 --> 03:07:48,210
I think that's incredibly important.

2343
03:07:48,350 --> 03:07:53,172
I think unfortunately some of the information presented here tonight is the victim of that.

2344
03:07:53,573 --> 03:07:58,736
There are some confused narratives that I think would be better served if we could clarify.

2345
03:07:58,756 --> 03:08:01,037
But specifically to GPA and school grades.

2346
03:08:01,657 --> 03:08:11,268
It's critical for us to realize that, as Mr. Belson mentioned, that there's a substantial increase in the state expectation for data systems.

2347
03:08:11,949 --> 03:08:18,576
We have to invest substantially in those systems, in our own internal systems, if we're going to keep up with the expectations of the state.

2348
03:08:19,316 --> 03:08:21,517
This is all new territory for us, obviously.

2349
03:08:21,877 --> 03:08:23,117
It changes on a yearly basis.

2350
03:08:23,538 --> 03:08:26,899
But it should be a priority of the school committee and of the school system itself.

2351
03:08:27,519 --> 03:08:34,621
The data systems that we presently have and how to increase in support and actually add to those systems.

2352
03:08:36,182 --> 03:08:36,582
Thank you.

2353
03:08:37,122 --> 03:08:37,402
Mayor?

2354
03:08:38,202 --> 03:08:38,882
Mr. Skerry.

2355
03:08:39,123 --> 03:08:43,344
I think that this would be best served if we had a committee of the whole meeting soon.

2356
03:08:44,080 --> 03:09:01,540
And then the information gathered from parents and students at that meeting be filtered down so that we can assign parts to the various subcommittees so that once and for all we can have a clear, concrete idea of what we're dealing with, find out what happened, why it happened, and how we fixed it, and how it's going to work in the future.

2357
03:09:02,484 --> 03:09:06,830
There's a motion on the floor that this paper be sent to Committee of the Whole by Mr. Skerry.

2358
03:09:06,870 --> 03:09:07,691
Is there a second?

2359
03:09:08,372 --> 03:09:09,173
Second.

2360
03:09:09,233 --> 03:09:10,554
Seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

2361
03:09:10,634 --> 03:09:13,258
All those in favor of sending this to Committee of the Whole?

2362
03:09:13,578 --> 03:09:14,119
Aye.

2363
03:09:14,159 --> 03:09:14,860
All those opposed?

2364
03:09:15,200 --> 03:09:15,961
Motion passes.

2365
03:09:17,423 --> 03:09:17,744
Thank you.

2366
03:09:21,857 --> 03:09:27,539
Motion that negotiation and legal matters be tabled until the meeting, our next meeting, which is next week.

2367
03:09:28,059 --> 03:09:32,420
Madam Mayor.

2368
03:09:32,880 --> 03:09:36,681
I just have a question that I'd like to throw out.

2369
03:09:36,821 --> 03:09:43,263
On the executive session papers to the next school committee meeting, basically tabling it.

2370
03:09:43,623 --> 03:09:46,044
Is there a second on the floor by Mr. Skerry?

2371
03:09:46,344 --> 03:09:46,644
Second.

2372
03:09:47,424 --> 03:09:48,644
Seconded by Mr. Skerry.

2373
03:09:49,124 --> 03:09:49,905
All those in favor?

2374
03:09:49,925 --> 03:09:50,345
Aye.

2375
03:09:50,665 --> 03:09:51,365
All those opposed?

2376
03:09:51,405 --> 03:09:52,125
Motion passes.

2377
03:09:52,165 --> 03:09:52,545
Thank you.

2378
03:09:52,785 --> 03:09:53,246
If I might.

2379
03:09:54,366 --> 03:09:55,206
Stand included.

2380
03:09:55,486 --> 03:10:03,748
Since we're talking about next week's meeting, I have to tell you as one committee member, this has not been an ideal setup for me tonight.

2381
03:10:05,029 --> 03:10:09,750
It's very difficult to feel like I'm having a conversation with my fellow school committee members.

2382
03:10:10,470 --> 03:10:11,712
The lights are in our eyes.

2383
03:10:12,694 --> 03:10:15,338
We only sort of see the audience.

2384
03:10:15,658 --> 03:10:21,867
And I'm not sure whether the television was capturing the speakers who came before us.

2385
03:10:22,128 --> 03:10:22,348
Yes?

2386
03:10:23,089 --> 03:10:23,309
Okay.

2387
03:10:27,135 --> 03:10:28,416
Oh, good.

2388
03:10:28,476 --> 03:10:29,016
Good for them.

2389
03:10:29,976 --> 03:10:30,617
That's great.

2390
03:10:30,677 --> 03:10:41,501
The only problem is that as a body who is interacting with my colleagues, frankly, it's very disconcerting to be trying to have a discussion in this.

2391
03:10:41,561 --> 03:10:44,983
So I'd like some thought put into this next week.

2392
03:10:45,003 --> 03:10:50,385
If I could just piggyback, we held city council meetings here during some renovations several years ago.

2393
03:10:50,805 --> 03:10:55,067
And we did set up a horseshoe up on the stage, and it worked out very nicely.

2394
03:10:55,127 --> 03:10:56,748
So maybe we can consider that for next week.

2395
03:10:58,429 --> 03:10:59,589
Can I just ask?

2396
03:11:00,070 --> 03:11:05,112
I know that the city council meetings, the last few of them, have been done in the station.

2397
03:11:05,272 --> 03:11:13,956
And the reason that I know that there's been discussion of having it here is because the issues that they've brought at the meeting has brought in a lot of people.

2398
03:11:13,996 --> 03:11:16,638
So it's been difficult to have it over there because it's packed.

2399
03:11:17,478 --> 03:11:19,419
We're at a situation where we're not like that.

2400
03:11:19,539 --> 03:11:21,440
Is it possible maybe for us to go back in there?

2401
03:11:21,460 --> 03:11:24,182
Because it's a lot more intimate than this.

2402
03:11:24,542 --> 03:11:24,782
We can.

2403
03:11:27,748 --> 03:11:32,531
All righty, new business.

2404
03:11:32,951 --> 03:11:34,232
School committee resolutions.

2405
03:11:34,292 --> 03:11:38,815
Be it resolved that the Medgar School Committee expresses some safe condolences to the family of Joan Gorman.

2406
03:11:39,255 --> 03:11:42,197
Mrs. Gorman was the mother of school committee member, Erin DiBenedetto.

2407
03:11:43,981 --> 03:11:48,563
Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Carl Galusi.

2408
03:11:48,723 --> 03:11:53,965
Mr. Galusi was the father of Medford teacher Matt Galusi and father-in-law of principal Suzanne Galusi.

2409
03:11:55,006 --> 03:11:59,708
Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Mitchell Chester.

2410
03:11:59,868 --> 03:12:03,910
Mr. Chester was a commissioner of the Mass Department of Elementary and Secondary Education.

2411
03:12:05,051 --> 03:12:09,556
Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee expresses sincere condolences to the family of Rosemary Alfie.

2412
03:12:09,576 --> 03:12:15,703
Mrs. Alfie was a former Medford High School secretary and the aunt of Public Information Officer Lisa Evangelista.

2413
03:12:16,684 --> 03:12:21,970
Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee expresses sincere condolences to the family of Anina Scaramuzzo.

2414
03:12:22,210 --> 03:12:25,534
Mrs. Scaramuzzo was the mother of Director of Foreign Language Rita DeCarlo.

2415
03:12:27,292 --> 03:12:32,254
And also be it resolved that the member of the school committee expresses sincere condolences to the family of Robert Murray.

2416
03:12:32,735 --> 03:12:38,738
Mr. Murray was the godfather of city employee Lisa Caticcio and uncle of school committee member Erin DiBenedetto.

2417
03:12:38,758 --> 03:12:43,580
If we could all rise for a moment of silence on the passing of these residents and relatives.

2418
03:12:56,778 --> 03:12:57,085
Thank you.

2419
03:13:01,673 --> 03:13:03,194
Is there a motion to adjourn?

2420
03:13:04,255 --> 03:13:04,495
Ms.

2421
03:13:04,555 --> 03:13:05,295
Cuneo.

2422
03:13:05,576 --> 03:13:10,519
Just before, I just want to say, I just want to congratulate the family.

2423
03:13:10,959 --> 03:13:16,443
Well, first of all, I'd like to congratulate Dr. Nicole Kieser and her family for her new baby.

2424
03:13:17,143 --> 03:13:22,187
And also for the Nelson and Kieser families, congratulations on them for their grandchild.

2425
03:13:22,247 --> 03:13:23,568
So that was a nice thing.

2426
03:13:24,869 --> 03:13:25,509
Congratulations.

2427
03:13:25,529 --> 03:13:26,169
Congratulations.

2428
03:13:27,770 --> 03:13:28,171
Very good.

2429
03:13:28,191 --> 03:13:30,252
Thank you very much for coming tonight.

2430
03:13:30,272 --> 03:13:31,333
Did you say motion to adjourn?

2431
03:13:36,781 --> 03:13:37,143
Thank you.
