    <p>[Robert Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=62.126s">Mayor,</a>  point of information regarding 9-11?</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=65.45s">Point</a>  of information, Mr. Skerry.</p>

    <p>[Robert Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=67.372s">Bedford</a>  High had a great baseball player in the 60s, John Doherty. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=71.696s">John</a>  went on to star at Boston College and became a stockbroker. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=75.881s">John</a>  was a personal friend of mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=77.182s">He</a>  grew up on Newton Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=78.884s">John</a>  was on the 92nd floor when the first plane hit. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=82.622s">And</a>  as far as we know, he was the only Methodist resident that lost his life on 9-11. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=85.963s">And</a>  I would hope that we would all remember him in our prayers in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=91.466s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=91.866s">Amen.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=94.387s">Also</a>  at this time, if you could remain standing, the Medford School Committee observe a moment of silence on behalf of the victims of Hurricane Harvey and Irma. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=101.31s">The</a>  Medford School Committee sends its heartfelt thanks to all those who provided shelter and rescue services to people displaced by these extraordinary storms.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=118.179s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=125.084s">The</a>  first order of business, approval of the minutes of June 19th, 2017. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=128.226s">Is</a>  there a motion for approval?</p>

    <p>[Robert Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=131.168s">On</a>  a motion for approval, Madam Mayor, I just have a point of inquiry.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=134.491s">Point</a>  of inquiry, Mr. Skerry.</p>

    <p>[Robert Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=135.811s">The</a>  minutes indicated that there was going to be a date set that evening for a subcommittee or a committee of the whole regarding smart brains. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=145.649s">And</a>  to date, we have not had a meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=147.49s">And</a>  I was wondering if the superintendent could tell us when he's going to schedule that meeting.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=150.891s">There's</a>  actually an item on the agenda tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=153.691s">Dr.</a>  Perrella will be presenting information on smart brains. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=156.512s">And</a>  subsequent to that, we can hold a committee meeting.</p>

    <p>[Robert Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=158.813s">I</a>  understand, but there are some parents that want to express concerns to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=162.394s">And</a>  unfortunately, they couldn't be here tonight on such short notice.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=164.574s">We</a>  certainly can have a committee of the whole after this.</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=168.284s">Is</a>  there a motion approval? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=169.084s">I</a>  have a question, Mayor Byron. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=170.565s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=170.765s">Kritz.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=172.386s">I</a>  wanted to know, I recall at the last meeting, the budget meeting, the library was going to have extended hours at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=180.75s">I</a>  didn't know if they had an update on what time the library was going to open and the time it was going to close this fall season. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=189.374s">Superintendent?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=191.495s">Update</a>  on library hours.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=194.943s">The</a>  library is going to open, the first couple of weeks is getting everything in order, but we'll probably have the people in place over the next week or so.</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=203.505s">Okay,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=204.805s">And</a>  I had one other item from, it would be considered, I think, old business. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=210.267s">And,</a>  you know, I just wanted to bring this up as a matter of concern related to the old business regarding the merger of the high school and the vocational technical high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=219.989s">It's</a>  concerning to me, some of the students and the parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=224.43s">I</a>  recall from the past discussion in the committee packets that it was very clearly expressed that the vocational <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=230.731s">high</a>  school was going to maintain its own identity. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=234.053s">However,</a>  it doesn't seem like that's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=238.016s">Over</a>  the first few weeks of school, I've seen some of the recent changes implemented, and they don't identify the vocational high school from the high school counterparts. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=247.902s">The</a>  two high schools were merged together, and they're no longer unique. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=251.844s">The</a>  vocational programs are made to distinguish the vocational from the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=256.227s">I</a>  realize the merger was beneficial to our school system for the financial reasons, <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=260.827s">However,</a>  the vocational school has lost their identity. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=264.449s">I've</a>  heard from discouraged students, parents, you know, they're asking me why the vocational school has been written off, so to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=272.692s">You</a>  know, I'm upset, my family is upset. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=276.634s">For</a>  example, here's some examples that recently, you know, I found out, you know, currently, and we found out during the parent evening session that there is no longer a vocational <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=288.903s">assistant</a>  principal. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=290.063s">It's</a>  all through the high school, which is a big adjustment for the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=294.144s">The</a>  guidance council was moved over to the high school office, which is also really difficult for the students to get to and to access their guidance Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=304.046s">You</a>  know, my son himself has been going back and forth, back and forth, multiple trips, trying to see if the guidance Councilor is in the office. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=311.007s">It's</a>  about a five minute walk to and from <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=313.808s">to</a>  get back to class. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=316.19s">That's</a>  just an inconvenience, and I understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=318.352s">And</a>  maybe the students need to make appointments. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=320.033s">However,</a>  the students are confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=322.816s">I'm</a>  confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=323.697s">Parents</a>  are confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=325.565s">Some</a>  of the students don't realize that even though it was explained in the student assembly, their assistant principal is at the high school, they don't really think so. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=336.777s">They</a>  don't believe it. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=338.239s">They</a>  want to be part of the vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=341.782s">And</a>  then some other things that developed that I found out over the last couple of days is that <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=348.455s">The</a>  vocational school won't have a class president or vice president. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=352.177s">This</a>  is very upsetting. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=353.577s">They</a>  will only have a med vocational representative. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=357.239s">It's</a>  just very upsetting. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=358.56s">There</a>  was a vice president last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=360.18s">There</a>  was assistant president. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=361.761s">There</a>  was a valedictorian. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=363.462s">That's</a>  all been taken away. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=365.102s">Who</a>  will represent the ideas and the needs of the vocational students? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=368.444s">It's</a>  difficult for one vocational student to relate all the students' needs and concerns to the high school representative. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=375.287s">I</a>  realize it's going to be one school. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=377.948s">but</a>  the programs operate very differently, and there needs to be representation from the vocational shop students. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=384.35s">A</a>  high school student's perspective cannot reflect the vocational student's needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=389.351s">They're</a>  really different. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=390.491s">Their</a>  days are structured differently. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=392.252s">Like</a>  my son has one week of shop, one week of academics. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=396.273s">During</a>  his week of academics, he has double blocks of academics, two blocks of math, two blocks of English. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=403.594s">He's</a>  behind on the testing schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=406.655s">Their</a>  timelines are very different. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=409.297s">Another</a>  thing I learned today while I was reaching out to get a copy of my son's transcript, and I received a letter along with a copy of my transcript that explained to me that from this point on, they are now under the high school number. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=426.185s">Last</a>  year, he had his own number, and it's on the enrollment package in this year's enrollment. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=431.848s">There</a>  was 56 students in the class. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=434.27s">However,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=435.82s">For</a>  the transcript, it's now going to be grouped together, which changes the class ranking, and it's really upsetting to the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=444.908s">They</a>  didn't know this was happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=446.55s">I</a>  didn't know this was happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=447.731s">I</a>  found this out today. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=450.634s">I</a>  was upset. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=451.895s">I</a>  know it doesn't matter to me what your class ranking is. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=455.078s">I</a>  say do the best you can. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=456.419s">You've</a>  got good grades. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=458.241s">I'm</a>  not all about that, but it was so upsetting that we didn't know this. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=464.305s">I</a>  went to the parent evening night last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=466.907s">This</a>  wasn't brought up. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=468.068s">None</a>  of these issues were brought up. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=469.91s">All</a>  of this information is getting trickled down, and the students are finding it out, and they're telling me. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=476.715s">And</a>  then here's another issue, is that the SkillsUSA program, that's exclusively for vocational students. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=483.741s">are</a>  we going to dissolve the SkillsUSA? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=485.602s">Because</a>  that's for the shop students. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=488.104s">So</a>  what I wanted to do was make a motion or a resolution to request a full report for our next meeting so we can discuss the updates and ask what the community thinks about all these updates. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=499.812s">And</a>  maybe invite some of the vocational students and maybe some representatives from the site council of the high school and some of the administrators from the site council to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=509.319s">and</a>  talk about these updates because I think when we moved to make it one school, I clearly remember in every discussion it was told that the vocational school will have its own identity. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=523.64s">I</a>  mean, I remember it. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=525.122s">So</a>  well, I just that's all I remember I say that we sure are you sure and that's what my concern was Because I represent the vocational students. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=533.468s">I'm</a>  there. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=534.409s">I</a>  popped in, you know, just last week to check with everybody Everything's going well with the new vice-principal. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=540.053s">I</a>  think it's the students are confused This is a really big adjustment and it's just when we went from last year June and <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=547.999s">You're</a>  a vocational student. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=549.08s">This</a>  year, my son is going to graduate with a high school degree. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=552.601s">He</a>  loves and he's proud to be a vocational student. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=555.863s">He's</a>  shocked. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=557.004s">He</a>  is just shocked and upset. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=558.444s">And</a>  I wanted him to come tonight, but he didn't want to. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=561.886s">He's</a>  actually really busy, and he didn't want to come forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=565.988s">But</a>  I'm just speaking on his behalf for his friends, and it's upsetting. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=571.091s">I</a>  don't want to go on and on much more, but I just had to. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=574.192s">I've</a>  been frustrated, and I've been emailing people. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=577.374s">I</a>  just had to mention my concerns.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=579.255s">Thank</a>  you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=579.815s">Kreatz.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=580.336s">Mr.</a>  Superintendent, could you address some of those concerns, please?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=584.978s">So,</a>  we have been talking about a merger of the high school and the vocational school for multiple years. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=590.701s">This</a>  is not a new topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=592.822s">The</a>  fact that it's starting to happen obviously brings about change. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=597.505s">And</a>  change is sometimes difficult for everyone to understand what it means. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=603.598s">The</a>  vocational school has its own identity by virtue of the fact it's governed by Chapter 74. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=609.183s">And</a>  youngsters will get occupational proficiency certificates and other aspects that are purely vocational. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=615.908s">The</a>  opportunity for the high school students to explore programs at the vocational school was one of our goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=621.793s">The</a>  opportunity for vocational students to take advanced courses at the high school was one of our goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=627.278s">The</a>  opportunity to share faculty members was one of our goals, and we've talked about this extensively. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=633.182s">But</a>  clearly, change is difficult, and it warrants maybe another meeting, a committee of the whole, to go into it in great depth, to talk about the things you're concerned about. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=643.838s">But</a>  clearly, we did talk about merging, and we talked about some of the sharing of activities. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=650.223s">Now,</a>  as far as class officers and things of that go, those are things that can be worked out. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=654.807s">But</a>  in terms of sharing classes, in terms of sharing programs, having 240 youngsters explore CTE options is something that never could have been done before. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=666.396s">Class</a>  rank. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=668.017s">Pardon</a>  me?</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=668.357s">Class</a>  rank.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=669.298s">Class</a>  rank, those things are all things that would come together. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=673.428s">Clearly,</a>  there's some misunderstandings or perhaps some serious questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=677.809s">Now,</a>  let's have a committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=678.91s">Let's</a>  go into it in great depth so that everyone understands. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=681.83s">And</a>  if there's a modification that has to be made, we'll talk about making it. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=685.632s">The</a>  other thing is reporting to the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=688.272s">If</a>  we have two codes in reporting to the state, we're going to gum up our ability to report to the state in an efficient and effective way. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=697.74s">So</a>  we've got to talk it through. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=700.001s">We</a>  went down this road because we felt this would give our youngsters greater opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=704.442s">But</a>  obviously, maybe we didn't explain it well enough, or maybe there needs to be more explanation. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=709.883s">And</a>  maybe we need to hear from some students and others. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=711.704s">But</a>  clearly, this was something that we've talked about extensively for multiple years. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=716.785s">But</a>  let's have a committee to hold. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=717.926s">That's</a>  probably the best way to do it.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=719.886s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=720.926s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=721.067s">Cugno.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=723.762s">Over</a>  the years, that's been something that we've always, as a committee, we've discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=728.065s">That</a>  we have a jewel in this city, that we do have a vocational school, and we do have a high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=734.749s">The</a>  goal was, and as Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=736.47s">Kreatz</a>  has pointed out, the goal was is to give the opportunities to our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=742.093s">Whether</a>  they go over to the vocational side or our students from the vocational side go over to our high school side. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=749.264s">But</a>  as far as the changes that Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=751.627s">Kreatz</a>  is discussing tonight, I have to say I'm really surprised because with <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=757.075s">The</a>  changes, we also made it very clear that we understood the codes that need to be changed because of the laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=764.185s">But</a>  we also knew the uniqueness of this school. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=767.369s">And</a>  so listening to all of a sudden the ranking being changed and no valedictorian and things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=776.107s">Those</a>  are things that are very, very concerning, not only as parents or school committee members, but take us out of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=782.112s">Think</a>  of the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=783.273s">Think</a>  of the students that are, especially students that are juniors and seniors this year, that have been thinking of this their whole entire time that they've been up at the high school or have heard of the high school and what the process is. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=794.041s">If</a>  we're going to go down an avenue to make, bless you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=798.624s">If</a>  we're going to go down an avenue that takes us that way, this is, as you just mentioned, we are going to have the Committee of the Whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=806.589s">I</a>  actually second Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=807.57s">Cress'</a>  motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=809.491s">It</a>  has to be discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=810.752s">We</a>  can't just expect our students to come in in September and all of a sudden everything changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=815.114s">If</a>  we're going to be changing these things, we need to figure out which ones that need to be changed gradually. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=822.409s">Let's</a>  grandfather the students that have been pertaining to this, that it pertains to. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=827.353s">If</a>  this is something that we're going to change as far as the valedictorian or the grades or our guidance Councilor being on the other side of the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=835.2s">These</a>  are things that need to be discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=836.761s">It</a>  can't be discussed or just written in a letter and just sent home or just told on a morning that our students are coming to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=843.746s">It's</a>  just not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=845.888s">So</a>  I am happy that-</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=849.651s">We</a>  found out a letter was mailed home to the families. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=852.954s">And</a>  even when I got the letter and it said that there's going to be a parent evening night for the high school and vocational families, I didn't know that letter meant that my son now has a different assistant. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=867.564s">I</a>  had no idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=868.905s">In</a>  fact, I called my colleague Paulette to say, Paulette, did you know about this? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=873.305s">because</a>  I was so baffled. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=874.747s">My</a>  sister was confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=876.248s">I</a>  was getting calls from parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=877.67s">What</a>  does this mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=878.892s">What</a>  happened to the vocational school? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=880.513s">I</a>  said, I don't know anything about this.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=882.215s">You</a>  know, I just want to say again, we've already discussed that we're going to have to have a committee of the whole make it really clear out there to our parents and our students are teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=893.568s">that</a>  before, I mean, all this is changing. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=895.889s">We</a>  really need to have a discussion, and it has to be an open discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=899.41s">There</a>  are things that are going on in the school system that, you know, we don't know, that maybe parents are not aware of, so the discussion has to be made. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=907.753s">And</a>  I hope that parents, you know, come to the table, and students come to the table, bringing their concerns, and we could really have a discussion on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=916.335s">Because</a>  again, the whole point of really going forward with this was the fact that <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=921.617s">We</a>  have a jewel, it is a very different type of situation and thrilled that especially our vocational students have the opportunities because a lot of them are going off to college that have the same type of opportunities and they're not taking night courses and things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=935.161s">But</a>  in the same way, we have to be sensitive in making sure that we're not taking everything away from both sides. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=941.322s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=942.183s">Van</a>  De Kloet.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=944.304s">There</a>  is a saying which says that the devil is in the details and I sort of feel like that's part of what our discussion about the vocational school and the <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=955.23s">the</a>  changes we had this summer, because while I'm having a feeling that perhaps the administration, it was all perfectly clear to them, all of these details, from the school committee perspective, as I had expressed to the superintendent, once I learned of some of the changes, was not clear at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=976.3s">For</a>  example, I was not clear that all of a sudden, <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=980.902s">guidance</a>  Councilor would no longer sit in that particular office over on their side, or that the kids would not have an assistant principal with them in the course of where those SHOP programs are held. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=996.578s">Maybe</a>  there's a good rationale behind a lot of the different changes, but quite honestly, I don't understand all of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1003.403s">And</a>  I think, I mean, as every, my colleagues have said, it's important for us to understand it in order to embrace them or to say, hey, wait a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1011.325s">does</a>  that really need to be and how do we maintain that identity for the vocational program, which I'll say the vocational program, because it's important that we have that identity held strong so that in the future, not only are they Mighty Mustangs, but they're members of the vocational program. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1031.909s">I</a>  think it's possible to be both in a very positive way. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1035.809s">So</a>  I look forward to the follow-up on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1038.27s">I</a>  certainly have a lot of questions as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1040.89s">And</a>  when I say that, I don't want to take away from the work that was done by so many in being able to bring some of the walls down, because there was a lot of work, and there are a lot of advantages. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1052.901s">And</a>  so we want to go forward being able to take advantage of all those positive things, but also really looking back and saying, wait a second, is that what we thought, and how does that work?</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1065.793s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1066.213s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1067.475s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1069.596s">So</a>  as the superintendent says, you know, change is good and difficult at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1077.963s">Whenever</a>  you're growing, there's growing pains. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1080.385s">But</a>  throughout change, what's necessary, and I think what hasn't happened here, is <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1089.238s">So</a>  I, as a school committee member, am very shocked to hear that there won't be a class valedictorian from the vocational program at graduation, because I pushed very many years ago to make sure that <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1106.805s">That</a>  happened and that they had a presence on the stage and they had a voice at graduation because it wasn't always celebrated as well as it is now at graduation. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1120.053s">And</a>  we celebrate both parts of our school together. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1126.818s">So</a>  to see that disappear is sad to me, because the programs are very different, and students work and excel in different ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1137.025s">And</a>  the way we pick valedictorian for one side of our programming might be different than how we pick it from another, and both have equal value. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1146.852s">And</a>  those kids need to be celebrated and have that option and that moment to shine. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1155.984s">in</a>  the same abilities that every other student is able to. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1161.509s">So</a>  class rank, we're having this discussion about another subject with our new computer programming. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1170.778s">And</a>  I as a parent really feel like that was important. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1176.983s">when</a>  my child was applying for schools, because your class rank matters if you're applying to certain schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1182.847s">And</a>  having that knowledge or knowing that if I just get that one more AP class or work a little harder in this section and I can meet that, I can be on the table for that school. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1194.115s">So</a>  I do think that there's value there as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1197.158s">And</a>  putting these different programs in one <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1202.972s">one</a>  bag isn't going to fare well for some of our top students in different sides. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1210.215s">So</a>  we really need to look at the details and we need to be better at communicating the little things. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1218.338s">Cause</a>  if the school committee members didn't know about these issues, about people changing sides of where they sit and that, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1228.964s">So</a>  many things important to our juniors and seniors are changing. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1233.446s">And</a>  how do we expect our parents to know that, and our students to know that, and to come in and find that out in that manner isn't appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1242.631s">So</a>  I agree, and I thank my colleague for bringing this forward with a strong voice. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1247.534s">And</a>  I agree, I second your motion to have a committee meeting and <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1253.897s">I</a>  invite all of our community to come forward and talk about the future of this merger.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1480.85s">I</a>  believe we're waiting for our attorney to attend so that we can provide more information. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1486.954s">Would</a>  you mind if we just table this item and we'll come back as soon as he enters? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1491.497s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1494.299s">Report</a>  of superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1495.36s">Report</a>  on the opening of schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1496.66s">School</a>  year 17-18. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1498.382s">Mr.</a>  Superintendent.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1500.563s">Mayor</a>  and members of the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1503.085s">So</a>  school year 2017 and 2018 officially began on Tuesday, August 29th, for students grades one to 12 and for kindergarten students on Wednesday, September 6th. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1514.714s">And</a>  overall, it was a good opening. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1516.595s">As</a>  usual, there were a few items that required adjustment. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1519.618s">Administration,</a>  faculty, staff invested substantial time and expertise to get a positive result. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1526.01s">This</a>  evening, you'll hear specific reports that document the opening, and additional reports will be forthcoming in the weeks ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1533.855s">As</a>  a school committee, you have been very supportive in supporting a number of the programs and budget lines that I'll enumerate right now, talking about some of the improvements that are now involved in the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1544.981s">So</a>  significant maintenance and construction around the district was accomplished. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1548.923s">Various</a>  individual school projects will continue during the next few months. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1553.526s">The</a>  new multimedia studio was completed. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1556.01s">Bistro</a>  49 is about a month away from operational completion. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1560.015s">Additional</a>  parking has been added to the high school complex, replacing the skateboard park. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1565.082s">And</a>  a number of capital fund projects will be advanced this fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1568.806s">Class</a>  sizes are very good throughout the district, and you have a detailed chart in your materials. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1575.102s">New</a>  members of our management team have been hired and have been made an excellent transition. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1579.644s">Major</a>  positions include a Vocational Technical Principal Director, an ELL Director, a Brooks Assistant Principal, Director of Fine Arts, McGlynn Middle Assistant Principal, and Director of Technology have all assumed their roles quite seamlessly. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1594.671s">We've</a>  hired 62 new personnel this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1598.213s">We</a>  have a chart attached to this report to fill vacant slots and to enhance our programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1605.474s">Our</a>  elementary science program has substantial new materials and we're actively piloting a new textbook series. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1612.261s">Each</a>  school is receiving a minimum of 50 new Chromebooks with charging cards to enhance our technology utilization. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1619.388s">We've</a>  expanded our library staff to support expanded hours at the high school and better access at the K-8 programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1625.855s">The</a>  middle schools have more foreign language this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1629.231s">The</a>  additional health teacher at the middle school will ensure that all students have access to the Michigan model. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1634.495s">And</a>  a special grant from the Attorney General's funds will enhance our opiate prevention education initiative. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1640.66s">A</a>  special grant from the Cummings Foundation will support expanded citizenship and community service education. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1647.164s">A</a>  grant from the state treasurer will support a new financial literacy initiative entitled Credit for Life. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1653.549s">A</a>  global scholars program will be expanded and we will participate in an international symposium. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1659.747s">Our</a>  high school vocational school merger is moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1663.51s">We</a>  think it benefits students grades nine to 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1666.673s">We've</a>  just had this discussion, so I'll put that off until we have our committee in the hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1671.558s">We</a>  have maintained a comprehensive curriculum that offers a full range of courses to students. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1676.602s">Unlike</a>  many other school systems, art and music have been enhanced and not cut back. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1681.387s">Once</a>  again, we have finished the year with a balanced budget, despite federal and state cutbacks. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1686.637s">We're</a>  working collaboratively to increase inclusivity in all our programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1690.638s">Our</a>  early childhood programs are among the best in the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1693.578s">The</a>  family network is a wonderful resource to young families. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1696.719s">We</a>  have excellent before and after school programs available. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1699.56s">You'll</a>  receive some reports on that this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1703.06s">Each</a>  new year brings some challenges, and this year is no exception. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1707.041s">But</a>  I'm confident that we'll meet our challenges and make progress in all areas of our school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1711.962s">MCAS</a>  2.0 will be in full force in 2018. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1715.611s">This</a>  past year was a trial year, and we will be receiving authorization to release results sometime in October. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1724.456s">A</a>  new test using some different formats certainly requires our attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1728.978s">Federal</a>  and state finance is uncertain. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1731.46s">Expanded</a>  attempts at privatization and reductions in key line items will require resourceful creativity to meet our needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1738.484s">There</a>  are already some programs that have felt the cut from Washington. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1741.845s">There</a>  are others that are being proposed and being a shift of funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1745.239s">A</a>  growing number of EL students will require modified programs that are responsive to the needs of those learners. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1750.52s">We</a>  did move the newcomers program from the Roberts over to the Brooks, but it did also affect us in the transportation line item. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1759.843s">So</a>  we need to talk about how those things work. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1762.264s">Expanded</a>  demands for technological capacity will require investment. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1766.125s">We're</a>  going to file for additional funding to match the E-rate that we've filed in Washington, which will expand our capacity <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1775.51s">to</a>  put on technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1777.912s">Spring</a>  2018, we'll see a new coordinated program review of our district by DESE. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1781.975s">It</a>  happens every six years. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1784.116s">We'll</a>  be ready. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1785.357s">I</a>  believe that Kathleen D'Aguilio and her staff are doing a great job putting that together. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1790.201s">Applications</a>  for additional capital projects to improve our facilities will require substantial planning and follow through. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1796.405s">On</a>  October 5th, we'll have a visit from SBA, School Building Authority, <a

this facility. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1809.957s">The</a>  review and adoption of several policies align with new laws and regulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1814.077s">Every</a>  year there's new laws and regulations that come out, and every year we have to think about how we're going to deal with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1819.738s">And</a>  every year there's some little wrinkle that comes up that requires an adjustment on our part. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1826.639s">The</a>  potential transition of key personnel will require planning and recruitment. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1830.758s">Every</a>  year there's some transition of key players, just like we talked about earlier in my message. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1835.42s">And</a>  we need a plan for that so that we can go forward as smoothly as we are right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1842.042s">Beyond</a>  the above concerns, it is important that we recognize that schools are much more than academic institutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1849.465s">The</a>  recent Phi Delta cap and poll of the public's attitudes towards public schools made the following statement. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1856.485s">Academic</a>  achievement isn't the only mission. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1859.446s">Americans</a>  overwhelmingly support investments in career preparation and personal skills. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1865.788s">Medford</a>  has consistently advocated for the whole child and youth transition to adulthood. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1871.35s">We</a>  must continue on that path. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1873.79s">Another</a>  key concern is media literacy. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1876.913s">We</a>  must help our students to develop the media literacy necessary to counteract the hateful ideas, the rhetoric, and the behaviors that are emerging unchallenged in our society. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1887.164s">The</a>  late Senator Patrick Moynihan, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, said, you are entitled to your own opinion, but you are not entitled to your own facts. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1895.767s">Opinion</a>  has become as true as facts today. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1898.528s">The</a>  September edition of the Atlantic Monthly explained it this way. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1901.848s">The</a>  internet and competing media outlets allows us to create communities that reinforce our preconceived beliefs with or without evidence. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1911.39s">Holocaust</a>  survivor Elie Wiesel said, the opposite of love is not hate, it is indifference. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1918.912s">Our</a>  most important curriculum will always be a curriculum of caring. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1924.252s">As</a>  we begin a new school year, we must rededicate ourselves to truth, to love and human development, as well as academic proficiency. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1932.455s">We</a>  cannot be indifferent. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1934.676s">Our</a>  students and our community need us to stand up. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1937.517s">We</a>  need to help each other meet the challenge. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1939.898s">And</a>  there's no better time than the present. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1942.363s">to</a>  embrace a curriculum of care, and I know we can do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1946.967s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1948.208s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1950.79s">Are</a>  there any questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1952.391s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1952.571s">Cuno?</a> </p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1953.292s">Just</a>  a couple. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1953.992s">Actually,</a>  to go back on the report that the superintendent just read off, <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1959.736s">As</a>  my colleague actually mentioned just a little while ago, just to go back real quick on the high school and vocational side. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1966.238s">I</a>  do urge that we have the committee of the whole sooner rather than later, because there has been tremendous work done by all. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1978.662s">And</a>  I don't want the information that we got out tonight to really impair that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1984.905s">So</a>  instead of having rumors and things going around like wild and rampant, I really do hope that we can have this meeting of a whole as quickly as possible so that way we can work on this and that we can discuss what really is going on and what changes are going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2002.673s">The</a>  other thing is I was just looking at the Andrews Middle School and the McGlynn Middle School. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2006.735s">I</a>  know that when we were looking at it, at budget time there was approximately 50 students, more at the Andrews than the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2013.159s">And</a>  I thought we were going to try to work something out to maybe even that out a little bit more. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2017.721s">So</a>  there could be some clarification on that?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2020.343s">Not</a>  this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2021.563s">We</a>  talked about, and you have something in the back of your folder about an action plan going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2026.752s">It's</a>  not possible to make that change right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2029.495s">So</a>  we'll work on that this year and hopefully by next year we'll smooth that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2033.098s">If</a>  you notice the 7th and 8th grade, fairly close. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2037.343s">The</a>  6th grade is really remarkably different. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2041.367s">It's</a>  like 47, 48 students. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2043.809s">And</a>  so that's a whole discussion and we've done some work on that and we'll be happy to present on that going forward.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2052.796s">with</a>  enrollment, and I don't know if this might be for Diane Caldwell. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2057.876s">For</a>  last year, we have last year district enrollment for 9.916 compared to this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2063.218s">So</a>  the only for the high school vocational last year was 13.65, this year is 13.50, so that makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2071.7s">The</a>  Andrews and the McGlynn Middle School were 9.46, now we're 9.38. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2076.161s">The</a>  one that I'm just curious if you have any insight is the total for the four elementary last year were 18.92, and this year was 16.08, a difference of 284. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2086.444s">Is</a>  that something with our demographics or I don't know if that seems like such a big bump. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2096.783s">The</a>  16th.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2097.623s">The</a>  16th verse. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2098.584s">We</a>  have the report on enrollment, item three.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2101.285s">I</a>  can't hear anybody.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2102.265s">Item</a>  three is our report on enrollment. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2104.426s">Should</a>  we hold that in abeyance until we get to that paper?</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2106.827s">Oh,</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2107.847s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2108.208s">You</a>  got it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2109.188s">We'll</a>  answer that at that point. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2111.669s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2113.39s">Is</a>  there no other questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2114.85s">I</a>  just have a housekeeping. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2117.071s">I</a>  didn't receive, attach the, I received one page of new hires, but not the second page. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2122.573s">So</a>  I don't know.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2123.033s">It</a>  should be a back to back. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2124.874s">No,</a>  it's not. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2125.935s">We'll</a>  get it for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2127.956s">If</a>  you could send those out to us, I'd appreciate it.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2131.378s">And</a>  then if we could take up that issue again about the Andrews-McGlynn when we're under enrollment.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2136.801s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2137.342s">Is</a>  there a motion to receive and place this paper on file? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2141.044s">Motion</a>  by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2141.824s">Gary,</a>  seconded by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2142.705s">Van</a>  der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2143.225s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2144.045s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2144.706s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2145.626s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2148.98s">Report</a>  on Administrative Meetings and New Teacher Induction Week, Mr. Superintendent.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2153.143s">I</a>  call upon our Deputy Superintendent, Beverly Nelson, to present this report.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2161.87s">Welcome,</a>  Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2162.37s">Nelson.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2163.251s">Good</a>  evening.</p>

    <p>[Beverly Nelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2168.43s">The</a>  week of August 21st to 25th was extremely busy for both administrators and for new teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2177.958s">Everyone</a>  was engaged in different meetings and activities. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2181.981s">I'm</a>  going to turn this over first to Dr. Riccadeli as she really spearheaded the induction week for us with the new teachers.</p>

    <p>[Ricciardelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2194.071s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2195.411s">Good</a>  evening, Madam Mayor and members of the Medford School Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2200.413s">So</a>  I am here tonight to report on our induction program that began on August 22nd. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2207.375s">The</a>  2017 New Teacher Induction Program was designed to introduce our newest educators to the district's policies and procedures, to familiarize them with curricular programs and technological applications <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2221.938s">And</a>  most importantly, to acclimate them to Medford as a caring educational partnership of school, family, and community. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2229.603s">We're</a>  hopeful that we achieved that goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2232.907s">So</a>  this year, we planned a four-day program that began, as I said, on Tuesday, August 22nd. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2240.394s">It</a>  really was spearheaded by our mentor coordinator, elementary teacher Donna Lasky. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2246.08s">If</a>  you remember last year, Jody Lu, who is now the assistant principal at the McGlynn, was the co-coordinator. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2252.646s">So</a>  this year, Donna Lasky really spearheaded, and I did help her with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2259.637s">A</a>  program schedule was sent to the committee, and we thank those of you who were able to attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2265.862s">Some</a>  minor adjustments were made based on some emerging needs at the last moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2272.307s">Workshops</a>  were held on a variety of topics that included the use of technology and our technology systems, including School Brains, Google, and TeachPoint, which is our evaluation management system. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2285.197s">New</a>  teachers were provided guidance on the educator evaluation tool by Paul DeLeva, Andrews Middle School principal, and myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2294.542s">A</a>  best practices workshop for grades 6 through 12 teachers was facilitated by former Medford Middle School teacher, Maureen Scholar Freeman. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2304.448s">Curricula</a>  support workshops for elementary staff provided an introduction to the important journeys and envisions program. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2311.67s">for</a>  our district literacy and math programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2314.732s">Teachers</a>  Abby Herman and Reagan O'Donoghue facilitated those workshops. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2321.057s">The</a>  induction program also included workshops on professionalism, a workshop on professionalism conducted by Medford High School Headmaster John Perella. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2329.883s">And</a>  I will tell you that I think that program got probably the highest review. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2334.246s">So</a>  thank you, Dr. Perella. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2336.272s">for</a>  that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2338.274s">We</a>  also had a social emotional health session which was facilitated by supervisor of nursing, Tony Vento, and supervisor of health and PE and athletics, Rachel Perry, also well received. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2353.138s">Consistent</a>  with our mission of creating a healthy social-emotional learning environment in the classroom, social studies teacher Elisabetta Dineu provided the group with strategies and tools on how to use yoga in the classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2366.674s">At</a>  the conclusion of this four-day program, we did ask the new teachers for feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2372.526s">We</a>  got a lot of great feedback, most of it very positive. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2376.948s">There</a>  were some logistical comments that we know that we can refine for next year, but they were very minor. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2382.691s">So</a>  we'll take that feedback and make the program even better for 2018. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2386.213s">I</a>  am happy to take any questions if you have any. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2389.014s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Beverly Nelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2400.402s">The</a>  new teachers were busy, the administrators were also busy. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2403.485s">We</a>  multitask around here and people were going from meeting to meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2408.391s">The</a>  administrative meeting started on Monday, the 21st. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2413.256s">And</a>  again, most administrators have been working all summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2417.901s">doing</a>  a variety of things, a lot of hiring goes on, reviewing of the preliminary MCAS test scores, but officially we began with our meetings on the 21st. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2428.611s">We</a>  welcomed our new administrators, the superintendent already referred to those individuals, so I will not repeat them again. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2436.478s">We</a>  covered many topics that are related to the opening of school and the events that are going to occur this year, such as the Coordinated Program Review and our Professional Development Program. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2449.985s">There</a>  were several DESE updates that when we went to the MASS conference this summer, we learned about many new changes and topics like teacher licensure that we shared with the administrators that week. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2465.981s">Administrators</a>  also received additional training in the use of ASAP, which is our substitute teacher program that we will continue to use this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2476.584s">And</a>  again, administrators were provided, we tried to have a balance of informative meetings, but also allow administrators time to open buildings, to get things started, and part of their week was spent, we had time with new teachers as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2492.227s">We</a>  felt that the week was very useful, there was a lot of <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2496.21s">effort</a>  and planning that went into it for many people, and we thank all of our teachers and administrators who contributed to both the Administrative Week schedule and the New Teacher Induction Program. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2507.259s">I've</a>  attached the agenda of the Administrative Week schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2511.082s">I</a>  know Bernadette already had sent you the New Teacher Schedule Induction Week, so I didn't want to waste any more paper, so I just had that one attached. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2521.33s">Anyone</a>  has any questions?</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2524.358s">I</a>  just want to say thank you to both people and Mrs. Lasky for organizing the new teacher induction and the administrative meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2534.244s">I</a>  had the opportunity to come up to the high school and say hello to the new teachers and of course they all look so young.</p>

    <p>[Beverly Nelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2542.55s">We</a>  always have a great group of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2545.232s">We</a>  always think going into the summer, well we don't have that many <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2547.74s">positions</a>  to hire, and then alas, it's 45, 50 people. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2551.362s">We</a>  also thank WB Mason. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2553.144s">They</a>  came forward with some goody bags for the teachers, and they welcomed those as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2557.947s">So</a>  everybody pitched in, and Diane Caldwell obviously played an important role in planning the administrative week. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2564.411s">I</a>  didn't mean to leave her out.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2566.488s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2567.289s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2567.609s">Your</a>  motion to receive and place this report on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2570.771s">So</a>  moved by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2571.452s">Puno,</a>  seconded by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2572.453s">Vandafood.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2572.973s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2573.754s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2574.474s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2575.155s">The</a>  motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2577.156s">Report</a>  on enrollment and class dies. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2579.278s">Mr.</a>  Superintendent.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2580.179s">We'll</a>  call on Assistant Superintendent Diane Caldwell to present this report and to address the question raised by a member of the staff.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2586.764s">We</a>  found it. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2587.604s">It</a>  was the missing kindergarten column.</p>

    <p>[Diane Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2589.646s">Good</a>  evening, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2590.927s">I</a>  think we did resolve the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2593.978s">portion,</a>  we didn't have kindergarten numbers because the children weren't in school at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2599.36s">And</a>  then one other piece of it, we didn't have preschool numbers down either. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2603.642s">So</a>  that's where the discrepancy came. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2605.863s">Good</a>  evening, everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2607.744s">Please</a>  find the attached current enrollment numbers effective September 5th through September 7th, 2017. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2612.746s">It</a>  is still early in the school year, and the Parent Information Center continues to be busy with additional registrations. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2623.971s">As</a>  you know, the Parent Information Center is right outside my offices, and we continue to have rows of people from different countries coming in, as well as people just moving into our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2637.575s">Elementary</a>  class size at all grade levels are excellent. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2641.776s">We</a>  have provided the Roberts Elementary School with additional classes in grades three and four, and I'd like to thank the school committee for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2649.925s">As</a>  you know, through the charts, you will notice that the enrollment in grade six at the Andrews is significantly higher than grade six at the McGlynn Middle School. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2659.81s">Due</a>  to this number, we have not transferred any additional students to the Andrews. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2665.192s">We</a>  are preparing an action plan moving forward to help balance enrollment numbers at the middle schools, and as the superintendent mentioned, we will get you that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2676.159s">Medford</a>  High School and the vocational school enrollment numbers in grades 9 and 10 are consolidated. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2682.604s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2682.804s">Sawyer</a>  did say that she would try to make a breakout for me so that I can see actually how many students are in the vocational school for grades 9 and 10. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2692.531s">We</a>  will provide you with additional information as the year progresses.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2699.815s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2702.176s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2703.976s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2704.937s">Thank</a>  you for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2706.317s">It</a>  really does look great. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2707.398s">Our</a>  class sizes are in great shape. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2710.579s">I</a>  mean, some of them around 2021, which is the top that we'd like to be at. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2716.28s">But</a>  overall, throughout the district, it looks <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2721.342s">very</a>  well attended at each school. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2723.984s">I</a>  do see a lot of room at the Columbus school and the class sizes are much lower there and we talked about that a little bit before our meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2733.171s">And</a>  how we would like to maybe look at programs that could be moved to that school to add and free up some <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2741.782s">some</a>  crowding at other schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2744.845s">So</a>  we want to keep that in mind for this year and maybe we can put some procedures or some implementation of those projects for this school year so that we're up and running with that and whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2758.557s">But</a>  the other thing which we're also talking about is, as a side note, on the back of that, <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2768.565s">of</a>  requested reports and I know some of the reports that were requested last year that weren't finished are not on this list. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2777.348s">So</a>  if you need me to look back, Superintendent Belson, and remind you which ones are outstanding, I can do that and email that to you this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2786.47s">If</a>  not, if you do have it, I'd like to see it on next week's agenda so that way we follow through with any motions or resolutions that were asked for last year and that <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2796.613s">The</a>  time went past and we didn't have enough time to finish those reports last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2802.096s">And</a>  one of them, I believe, was how the new development is impacting our moment in our school districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2812.002s">We</a>  have had a few developments that have recently been opened in more people. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2818.946s">living</a>  in those buildings, and we don't know how that's impacting our students or our populations at each school. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2826.293s">And</a>  I requested it almost a year ago, might have been after January last year, and I know that that report wasn't forthcoming. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2834.781s">And</a>  I'm not saying that it's going to be easy to get those numbers, but I would like to see them. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2841.065s">Moving</a>  forward, if there is a lot of development in one district or one area or one elementary school area, do we have to look at maybe redistricting some of the newer buildings brought online to see if they could go to a school less populated and how we want to look at that? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2860.454s">And</a>  we want to follow that this year because there are some, a lot of new building going on in the Wellington Circle area, which could affect both the McGlenn and the Roberts. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2870.843s">And</a>  those are our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2872.525s">I</a>  mean, yeah, the McGlenn and the Roberts. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2874.727s">And</a>  those are our schools with the highest population of students, if you look. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2878.943s">They're</a>  both over 500 students, our close are over 500 students, and our other two schools have less.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2887.007s">So</a>  we just want to look at where people are moving into the city, what places are they moving into, what places are they moving into with young children attending our elementary school, and what are the inappropriate places to be put them in. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2947.267s">it.</a> </p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2956.513s">So</a>  he'll be looking at all of those so you'll have factual information I think and we're gonna be very surprised at how little they have actually impacted our school system But we'll wait to get the numbers to confirm that and that should be for As well as new development that hasn't yet been approved is like where that's gonna happen throughout the city and how that future</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2977.871s">those</a>  future developments could impact us. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2980.653s">Those</a>  having the present numbers will help us know what the prediction is for the next.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2986.156s">They</a>  will help us predict for sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2987.697s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2988.598s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2988.998s">So</a>  there is a motion on the floor to have that report.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2991.96s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2994.041s">On</a>  the motion that a report be submitted with the numbers that some of our larger developers have submitted. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3002.647s">All</a>  in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3003.187s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3003.307s">Opposed?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3003.747s">Motion</a>  passes.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3005.168s">So</a>  it's Trisha. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3008.933s">It's</a>  important to understand that every time we move populations to different parts of the city, it impacts transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3017.679s">So</a>  that when we did the newcomers program movement from the Roberts to the Brooks, it cost us an extra bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3025.324s">So</a>  it's tricky, we may have to look at redistricting as a better alternative. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3033.957s">Quite</a>  frankly, as the mayor points out, I think when you see the numbers coming out of the new developments, it hasn't really impacted us much at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3041.986s">Now,</a>  it may in the future, but right now it hasn't.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3045.309s">Mayor</a>  Burke? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3046.671s">Mr.</a>  Skerry had a point of information.</p>

    <p>[Robert Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3049.884s">for</a>  both of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3052.646s">What</a>  is the status of the project on Volker Street, where they indicated they were bringing in 700 rental units?</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3058.951s">No,</a>  they didn't say 700. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3060.092s">It</a>  was 400 and something, but it's in the land court. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3062.114s">Appeals</a>  have been filed in the land court. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3066.418s">No</a>  decisions have been made by any judge on any of the issues pending there.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3073.858s">Yes,</a>  my question, I heard something about there will be an action report, and I think that's in relation to the discrepancy of enrollment between the Andrews and McGlynn, is that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3085.783s">That's</a>  correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3086.604s">Okay,</a>  and when are we to expect that?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3089.745s">It's</a>  in your folder. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3091.416s">The</a>  report is in the back of our file.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3093.377s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3094.417s">And</a>  the biggest concern I have right at the moment, I think that there's a long term and a short term, but clearly we heard from some parents of students who did not get their first choice school and were very upset about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3110.023s">And</a>  I just wanted to make sure that we follow those kids and make sure that their acclimation to the new school is in fact going well and they're not being adversely impacted.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3121.163s">Is</a>  there approximately 40 on the wait list, or is it higher?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3124.064s">Well,</a>  it's not so much a wait list. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3126.304s">There's</a>  a 48, 49 people differential between the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3130.205s">And</a>  I think it was 14 on the wait list.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3132.285s">That's</a>  it, 14?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3133.345s">Yeah,</a>  14. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3133.685s">But</a>  if one goes, then the other 13 legitimately say, how come not me? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3138.466s">So</a>  at this point in time, we really can't make any moves. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3141.387s">Talked</a>  to a number of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3144.808s">Some</a>  people accept no better than other people.</p>
