01:09:49,272 --> 01:09:52,013
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm Stacey Shulman, the director of school counseling and behavioral health.

150
01:09:52,833 --> 01:09:59,235
[SPEAKER_13]: And I am pleased to introduce Kelsey, our new assistance dog for Medford Public Schools.

151
01:09:59,255 --> 01:10:00,535
[SPEAKER_13]: You can see her right at my feet there.

152
01:10:00,575 --> 01:10:01,115
[SPEAKER_13]: Perfect.

153
01:10:02,075 --> 01:10:07,937
[SPEAKER_13]: Kelsey is a two-year-old black lab who has been born and raised exclusively under the care of NEADS.

154
01:10:08,497 --> 01:10:11,159
[SPEAKER_13]: an organization who trains service and assistance dogs.

155
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:18,285
[SPEAKER_13]: I began the application process for a school assistance dog in 2018 and was matched October of this year.

156
01:10:19,305 --> 01:10:22,288
[SPEAKER_13]: COVID extended this timeframe, but the process is very lengthy.

157
01:10:22,988 --> 01:10:34,256
[SPEAKER_13]: In order to proceed with a match, needs had to approve my application, which required interviews, letters of recommendation, and the sign off by my physician showing I was physically and mentally capable of taking on this responsibility.

158
01:10:35,177 --> 01:10:38,980
[SPEAKER_13]: Kelsey has been in training her entire life until now two full years.

159
01:10:40,241 --> 01:10:45,785
[SPEAKER_13]: I was trained at the needs campus as well where I stayed every day overnight for a week and a half.

160
01:10:46,646 --> 01:10:54,452
[SPEAKER_13]: I am pleased to announce Kelsey and I both passed our certification exams and are now recognized through Assistance Dog International as a certified pair.

161
01:10:55,734 --> 01:11:04,559
[SPEAKER_13]: She knows about 50 different commands from general obedience to complex tasks based work, such as getting tissues and turning the pages of a book.

162
01:11:05,019 --> 01:11:06,620
[SPEAKER_13]: She is truly an amazing dog.

163
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:11,883
[SPEAKER_13]: Kelsey and I have been in many of the schools so far getting acclimated to her new job and our new partnership.

164
01:11:12,743 --> 01:11:18,107
[SPEAKER_13]: She has already worked with dozens of students for comfort and joy and visited a few classrooms.

165
01:11:18,347 --> 01:11:20,008
[SPEAKER_13]: She's also worked with many of our staff.

166
01:11:20,528 --> 01:11:25,612
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilors at MHS can arrange for students to have a visit with Kelsey and I will continue to visit classrooms.

167
01:11:26,192 --> 01:11:31,256
[SPEAKER_13]: I will be working with the administrators and Councilors at other schools for visits as well when I'm there for regular meetings.

168
01:11:31,836 --> 01:11:35,879
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm pleased to have her here for you all to take a look at her this evening.

169
01:11:35,979 --> 01:11:37,020
[SPEAKER_13]: She's really amazing.

170
01:11:37,720 --> 01:11:39,001
[SPEAKER_13]: Did she make office visits?

171
01:11:39,681 --> 01:11:41,563
[SPEAKER_13]: She can potentially make an office visit, yes.

172
01:11:42,443 --> 01:11:42,824
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

173
01:11:44,324 --> 01:11:44,625
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

174
01:11:44,665 --> 01:11:45,565
[SPEAKER_10]: That's wonderful.

175
01:11:45,605 --> 01:11:46,686
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for taking that on.

176
01:11:46,706 --> 01:11:54,310
[SPEAKER_10]: We know it was extensive training and it's gonna make so many of our students happy and calm throughout the years.

177
01:11:54,870 --> 01:11:55,151
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

178
01:11:55,171 --> 01:11:55,611
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely.

179
01:11:55,771 --> 01:11:56,932
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for having us.

180
01:12:04,376 --> 01:12:05,877
[SPEAKER_10]: Get her a T-R-E-A-T.

181
01:12:12,805 --> 01:12:17,767
[SPEAKER_10]: Next up, we have the Medford Mustang marching band football and golf team achievement recognition.

182
01:12:17,827 --> 01:12:23,689
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'll turn it over to you, Dr. Edouard-Vincent, our superintendent, Michael Dampierre, marching band director, and Ms.

183
01:12:23,749 --> 01:12:28,511
[SPEAKER_10]: Rachel Perry, our director of health and PE and assistant director of athletics.

184
01:12:29,131 --> 01:12:29,431
[SPEAKER_10]: Welcome.

185
01:12:30,451 --> 01:12:30,852
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

186
01:12:30,912 --> 01:12:31,292
[SPEAKER_17]: Welcome.

187
01:12:31,352 --> 01:12:32,412
[SPEAKER_17]: So Ms.

188
01:12:32,432 --> 01:12:37,354
[SPEAKER_17]: Perry, I'm going to have you, we're going to start with which group today would you like us to start with?

189
01:12:41,431 --> 01:12:47,195
[SPEAKER_09]: Eileen O'Hara in cross country and coach Carla Andre in unified and then they'll announce the rest of the coaches.

190
01:12:47,696 --> 01:12:48,496
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, perfect.

191
01:12:49,077 --> 01:12:55,522
[SPEAKER_17]: And since we have, we have a humongous pile of certificates I don't know if Miss Malone still has them.

192
01:12:56,242 --> 01:12:57,863
[SPEAKER_17]: So we're going to.

193
01:12:58,684 --> 01:13:09,031
[SPEAKER_17]: I will say your names when it comes to the respective teams, and we will have you come and line up in this inner circle, because it's going to be a lot of you.

194
01:13:09,612 --> 01:13:15,756
[SPEAKER_17]: So when you hear your name being said, please come forward and know that your certificates will be given to you today.

195
01:13:16,076 --> 01:13:20,859
[SPEAKER_17]: And then I know there are a few special announcements that Ms.

196
01:13:20,899 --> 01:13:26,023
[SPEAKER_17]: Perry will be making, and those ones will be called up to receive their certificates in hand.

197
01:13:26,738 --> 01:13:31,680
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, each coach will identify the MVPs and they'll come up individually.

198
01:13:31,940 --> 01:13:32,840
[SPEAKER_17]: Perfect, perfect.

199
01:13:39,482 --> 01:13:49,506
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, I'm Eileen O'Hara, the girls and boys cross country coach at Medford High School, and I'm here to speak about two impressive student athletes who were league MVPs this year.

200
01:13:50,563 --> 01:13:57,871
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first student athlete I'll recognize is Adam Lewis, who was voted a Greater Boston League cross country co-MVP this year.

201
01:13:58,632 --> 01:14:01,595
[SPEAKER_01]: Adam took first place at all but one of our dual meets this season.

202
01:14:02,255 --> 01:14:12,226
[SPEAKER_01]: And he took first place at our end of season league meet, winning the 2.6 mile race by less than one second in one of the most exciting ends to a race that I've ever seen.

203
01:14:13,890 --> 01:14:19,192
[SPEAKER_01]: Adam put in a lot of work over the summer and throughout the fall in order to have the success he did this season.

204
01:14:19,212 --> 01:14:22,574
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking miles upon miles of running.

205
01:14:23,294 --> 01:14:25,015
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he really earned that title.

206
01:14:25,695 --> 01:14:34,918
[SPEAKER_01]: He's an athlete who wants to work hard and that's something that his teammates are watching and taking note of and emulating and it's really helping to elevate our whole team.

207
01:14:35,259 --> 01:14:38,620
[SPEAKER_01]: So congratulations and thank you to Adam for his hard work.

208
01:14:58,479 --> 01:15:10,488
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also had a league MVP on the girls side in Emma Beardsley so she was actually voted the league MVP for the second year in a row this season, which is very impressive, and she's only a junior.

209
01:15:12,070 --> 01:15:18,675
[SPEAKER_01]: Emma has been absolutely dominant in our league over the last two years, just to give you a sense of how dominant she's been.

210
01:15:19,435 --> 01:15:23,380
[SPEAKER_01]: She won her end of season league meet by one minute and nine seconds.

211
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:26,223
[SPEAKER_01]: So nobody was even in her vicinity.

212
01:15:27,044 --> 01:15:27,925
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very impressive.

213
01:15:28,445 --> 01:15:31,048
[SPEAKER_01]: And she broke her own course record in the process.

214
01:15:32,490 --> 01:15:39,177
[SPEAKER_01]: She's an athlete who's always looking to better herself another athlete who ran miles upon miles upon miles over the summer.

215
01:15:40,657 --> 01:15:46,983
[SPEAKER_01]: And even when she's already leading a race, she's still able to push herself to run a personal best time.

216
01:15:47,804 --> 01:15:56,111
[SPEAKER_01]: She's really bought into the sport and she's another athlete who's helping to make our whole team better by showing her teammates what can be accomplished through hard work.

217
01:15:56,451 --> 01:15:58,673
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you to Emma and congratulations.

218
01:16:09,346 --> 01:16:10,346
[SPEAKER_04]: Good evening, everybody.

219
01:16:10,587 --> 01:16:13,608
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Carla Andre, and I am the Unified Sports Coach.

220
01:16:14,809 --> 01:16:19,711
[SPEAKER_04]: On behalf of Bedford's Unified Sports Program, I want to acknowledge Jonathan Malerba tonight.

221
01:16:20,529 --> 01:16:27,974
[SPEAKER_04]: He's recognized tonight for his outstanding leadership, dedication, and his contribution towards meaningful inclusion in Medford athletics.

222
01:16:28,675 --> 01:16:33,478
[SPEAKER_04]: During our season, Jonathan was selected as Unified Basketball's first ever team captain.

223
01:16:34,259 --> 01:16:40,844
[SPEAKER_04]: Congratulations to Jonathan on all of his hard work and accomplishments, both for cross country and for Unified Basketball.

224
01:16:41,704 --> 01:16:42,425
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on up, Jonathan.

225
01:16:54,622 --> 01:16:58,003
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm now gonna turn it over to coach Rob Gossieri for girls soccer.

226
01:16:58,363 --> 01:16:58,743
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

227
01:17:12,866 --> 01:17:13,826
[SPEAKER_20]: Good evening, everyone.

228
01:17:13,846 --> 01:17:17,187
[SPEAKER_20]: We're gonna try some technology tonight.

229
01:17:17,207 --> 01:17:18,907
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's see if I can make it happen.

230
01:17:19,929 --> 01:17:25,315
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, so this evening I'm here representing the Medford girls soccer team.

231
01:17:25,996 --> 01:17:34,666
[SPEAKER_20]: They all refer to me as coach Rocco, I don't know when the tradition started but we're stuck with the first name as, as a as a coach.

232
01:17:36,909 --> 01:17:40,811
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'm really excited to introduce this athlete to you, J.K.

233
01:17:40,991 --> 01:17:42,212
[SPEAKER_20]: We refer to her as J.K.

234
01:17:42,672 --> 01:17:44,273
[SPEAKER_20]: Her full name is Josira Kouyate.

235
01:17:45,373 --> 01:17:45,713
[SPEAKER_20]: J.K.

236
01:17:45,733 --> 01:17:51,296
[SPEAKER_20]: has been our central midfield player, playmaker, and heartbeat throughout the competitions this entire fall season.

237
01:17:52,136 --> 01:17:54,698
[SPEAKER_20]: She is a hard worker at practice and at games.

238
01:17:55,618 --> 01:18:01,941
[SPEAKER_20]: She scores, she assists, she defends, and she's exemplary, mostly for her sportsmanship.

239
01:18:02,942 --> 01:18:04,943
[SPEAKER_20]: She cares for every player on our team,

240
01:18:05,973 --> 01:18:08,175
[SPEAKER_20]: and all those on the opposition.

241
01:18:09,376 --> 01:18:16,541
[SPEAKER_20]: Statistics don't always tell the full story, but our team, especially the younger players, know that she's the field leader of our team.

242
01:18:17,802 --> 01:18:27,209
[SPEAKER_20]: At the conclusion of the season, she was awarded the GBL Girls Soccer MVP unanimously by the coaches, and she was nominated by an opposing coach.

243
01:18:29,946 --> 01:18:35,130
[SPEAKER_20]: She was an Eastern Mass First Team All-Star, and this was her second year receiving the award.

244
01:18:35,690 --> 01:18:41,495
[SPEAKER_20]: And she's a three-time select GBL player, which has only been happening for the last three years.

245
01:18:42,335 --> 01:18:44,216
[SPEAKER_20]: She's an absolute star.

246
01:18:44,697 --> 01:18:46,958
[SPEAKER_20]: Can't wait to see what she does in the future.

247
01:18:47,539 --> 01:18:48,119
[SPEAKER_20]: So, JK.

248
01:19:04,807 --> 01:19:17,783
[SPEAKER_17]: So I would like to ask all of the athletes, Josiah, Adam, Emma and Jonathan, plus your coaches to please come to the center circle space so we can take a group picture and all members of the committee.

249
01:19:18,004 --> 01:19:18,304
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

250
01:19:35,891 --> 01:19:55,023
[SPEAKER_08]: Rocco, Rocco, can you just put that on the ground?

251
01:19:55,083 --> 01:19:58,425
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me hold the mic.

252
01:19:58,505 --> 01:19:59,646
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, hold up.

253
01:20:02,685 --> 01:20:03,946
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

254
01:20:31,101 --> 01:20:31,661
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

255
01:20:31,681 --> 01:20:35,564
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm gonna call up golf coach Rich Citrano next.

256
01:20:47,172 --> 01:20:48,173
[SPEAKER_18]: Good evening, everybody.

257
01:20:48,413 --> 01:20:51,115
[SPEAKER_18]: For those of you who don't know me, my name is Rich Citrano.

258
01:20:52,056 --> 01:20:59,361
[SPEAKER_18]: And in case you missed some of the posts on the athletic webpage, I'd like to share with you some of the highlights.

259
01:21:01,016 --> 01:21:08,318
[SPEAKER_18]: This fall, the golf team won the Greater Boston League Championship with an impressive eight wins, one loss, and one tie.

260
01:21:16,420 --> 01:21:22,862
[SPEAKER_18]: We finished second place in the GBL shootout, and we also qualified for the Division II North States.

261
01:21:23,672 --> 01:21:26,433
[SPEAKER_18]: Those were just a few of the team accomplishments.

262
01:21:27,074 --> 01:21:29,335
[SPEAKER_18]: We also have some individual accomplishments.

263
01:21:29,415 --> 01:21:38,839
[SPEAKER_18]: We had four league all-stars and one MVP, which you'll hear about a little bit more in a few moments.

264
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:42,761
[SPEAKER_18]: We do have a lot of returning players from last year's team.

265
01:21:43,242 --> 01:21:48,144
[SPEAKER_18]: So I would be remissed if I didn't talk about an award that the kids won last year.

266
01:21:49,085 --> 01:21:55,131
[SPEAKER_18]: And that was the sportsmanship award, which was voted by all of the GBL League coaches.

267
01:21:55,531 --> 01:21:55,831
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

268
01:21:56,472 --> 01:22:01,577
[SPEAKER_18]: And, you know, Medford golfers realized that the character

269
01:22:02,879 --> 01:22:07,400
[SPEAKER_18]: and how you behave on the course is what most people will remember about you.

270
01:22:07,820 --> 01:22:11,441
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not necessarily what you shot or whether you won or lost.

271
01:22:12,041 --> 01:22:24,504
[SPEAKER_18]: And on many occasions, I witnessed our players going into the woods or walking near a water hazard, helping their opponents find their golf ball, even though it would be more advantageous to them if they

272
01:22:24,984 --> 01:22:29,845
[SPEAKER_18]: their opponent never found the ball so that that alone shows unbelievable character.

273
01:22:30,685 --> 01:22:40,447
[SPEAKER_18]: And these little these sounds like just little kind things of little things that add up to what these kids have created a culture that this community can be proud of.

274
01:22:49,950 --> 01:22:51,870
[SPEAKER_18]: Next up is football coach John Curley.

275
01:23:05,783 --> 01:23:06,224
[SPEAKER_17]: You're next.

276
01:23:06,864 --> 01:23:07,225
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

277
01:23:07,966 --> 01:23:09,487
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

278
01:23:10,108 --> 01:23:13,131
[SPEAKER_17]: So, Gavin Bailey, please come to the center circle.

279
01:23:13,812 --> 01:23:24,404
[SPEAKER_17]: James Camuso, Vincent Castro Jr., Carter Chavon, Emmett Chasteen, our GBL MVP, Evan

280
01:23:26,040 --> 01:23:40,473
[SPEAKER_17]: Chialoni, David Crowen, Joshua Lamont, Anthony Mattarisi, James Montello, Michael Morando, Nathan Tremlett, Patrick Waldron, and Jonathan Wright, and Coach Citrano.

281
01:23:40,513 --> 01:23:41,814
[SPEAKER_17]: Please come forward, all of you.

282
01:23:42,555 --> 01:23:45,077
[SPEAKER_17]: And members of the committee, let's celebrate.

283
01:23:45,097 --> 01:23:51,803
[SPEAKER_08]: Eric.

284
01:23:51,823 --> 01:23:52,803
[SPEAKER_08]: Eric.

285
01:23:57,332 --> 01:23:58,233
[SPEAKER_07]: Should we do a nailing?

286
01:24:53,083 --> 01:24:53,565
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

287
01:24:53,706 --> 01:24:56,540
[SPEAKER_09]: Now we have football coach John Curley.

288
01:25:21,357 --> 01:25:23,338
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, my name is John Curley.

289
01:25:23,358 --> 01:25:26,280
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the head football coach of Medford High.

290
01:25:26,340 --> 01:25:31,182
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, I just want to say congratulations to all the teams that hit tonight, all the fall teams.

291
01:25:31,763 --> 01:25:40,827
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe this is probably the most league titles the Medford's probably had in a long time, most all-stars in probably a long time, most MVPs of all time.

292
01:25:40,867 --> 01:25:43,569
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just want to give everyone in this room a round of applause right here.

293
01:25:50,390 --> 01:25:51,991
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you to the school committee for inviting us.

294
01:25:52,011 --> 01:25:53,891
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you to the mayor, superintendent.

295
01:25:54,512 --> 01:25:55,332
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you to the principal.

296
01:25:56,012 --> 01:25:59,173
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, thank you to Mr. Maloney and Mrs. Perry.

297
01:25:59,213 --> 01:26:01,054
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't be here if you guys didn't hire me.

298
01:26:01,074 --> 01:26:02,055
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do appreciate that.

299
01:26:02,255 --> 01:26:03,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for all you do for the community and sports.

300
01:26:04,876 --> 01:26:06,536
[SPEAKER_02]: But now let's get to the football team.

301
01:26:08,417 --> 01:26:15,120
[SPEAKER_02]: So historic season, first time since 1985, Medford High has won the GBL title.

302
01:26:24,637 --> 01:26:32,083
[SPEAKER_02]: Back-to-back Thanksgiving wins since 2001, and then back-to-back win season since 1991.

303
01:26:33,204 --> 01:26:38,408
[SPEAKER_02]: So historic season really is the word for this season and to the seniors.

304
01:26:39,329 --> 01:26:41,831
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to thank them for showing up every day to practice.

305
01:26:42,531 --> 01:26:44,612
[SPEAKER_02]: When times were tough, they were always there.

306
01:26:45,293 --> 01:26:48,455
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we saw our vision, other people didn't see it.

307
01:26:48,795 --> 01:26:49,936
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys kept on moving forward.

308
01:26:50,296 --> 01:26:52,377
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm really proud of you guys always keeping the train moving.

309
01:26:52,397 --> 01:26:53,038
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you, guys.

310
01:26:53,058 --> 01:26:53,818
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you, seniors.

311
01:27:01,824 --> 01:27:03,505
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I have two awards to give out.

312
01:27:04,365 --> 01:27:06,687
[SPEAKER_02]: First award, again, historic.

313
01:27:07,087 --> 01:27:07,327
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse me.

314
01:27:07,347 --> 01:27:08,628
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you forget one historic moment?

315
01:27:10,060 --> 01:27:10,976
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, you're gonna talk about that, okay.

316
01:27:14,289 --> 01:27:16,231
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

317
01:27:16,351 --> 01:27:17,912
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was getting to the historic moment.

318
01:27:18,152 --> 01:27:19,954
[SPEAKER_02]: It's OK.

319
01:27:20,014 --> 01:27:22,055
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have two certificates to give out.

320
01:27:22,155 --> 01:27:26,799
[SPEAKER_02]: So the reason why I wanted to talk about historic moments, because this really was a historic season.

321
01:27:28,260 --> 01:27:33,164
[SPEAKER_02]: We have, I know there was a couple of females that played football before, before I got here.

322
01:27:34,125 --> 01:27:41,251
[SPEAKER_02]: I had one female football player that played for us for four years, kept on battling every day, showing up to practice.

323
01:27:41,724 --> 01:27:42,625
[SPEAKER_02]: Tried to be a kicker.

324
01:27:43,846 --> 01:27:46,348
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't really work out and started playing fullback.

325
01:27:46,488 --> 01:27:47,188
[SPEAKER_02]: Played safety.

326
01:27:47,809 --> 01:27:49,630
[SPEAKER_02]: Had a few injuries, couldn't play all year.

327
01:27:50,471 --> 01:27:52,513
[SPEAKER_02]: Got revalued.

328
01:27:52,713 --> 01:27:54,894
[SPEAKER_02]: I was able to play Thanksgiving and on senior night.

329
01:27:55,375 --> 01:28:01,600
[SPEAKER_02]: And then on senior night, she became the first female to score points in the varsity game for Medford High, which is awesome.

330
01:28:12,468 --> 01:28:14,469
[SPEAKER_02]: And her name is Brianna Swirlos.

331
01:28:14,489 --> 01:28:15,169
[SPEAKER_02]: Congratulations.

332
01:28:27,195 --> 01:28:28,756
[SPEAKER_02]: I have one more award to give out.

333
01:28:30,717 --> 01:28:34,379
[SPEAKER_02]: First, first GBL MVP the football team has had.

334
01:28:36,603 --> 01:28:45,028
[SPEAKER_02]: He broke a 52-0 record for most points, most yards, most touchdowns in one game, two-year captain.

335
01:28:47,289 --> 01:28:53,092
[SPEAKER_02]: I really do defines the word student-athlete, a true gentleman, a scholar, wears the colors the right way.

336
01:28:55,578 --> 01:28:56,959
[SPEAKER_02]: deserves all the accolades he can get.

337
01:28:58,020 --> 01:29:07,009
[SPEAKER_02]: He is an all-around player for sports, basketball, baseball, but I've been telling him since his junior year that he is a football player.

338
01:29:07,289 --> 01:29:08,631
[SPEAKER_02]: So congratulations, Justin Marino.

339
01:29:24,518 --> 01:29:32,743
[SPEAKER_02]: I know the superintendent is going to name off a few names for the roster, but Chris Murphy wants to talk about the program for about 30 seconds.

340
01:29:33,083 --> 01:29:33,823
[SPEAKER_02]: I apologize.

341
01:29:37,145 --> 01:29:38,226
[SPEAKER_19]: I just can't help myself.

342
01:29:39,847 --> 01:29:44,369
[SPEAKER_19]: I know he's going to kill me real quick, but I can't not talk.

343
01:29:44,730 --> 01:29:46,170
[SPEAKER_19]: These kids did a wonderful job.

344
01:29:46,771 --> 01:29:48,952
[SPEAKER_19]: These seniors are leaving this program better than they found it.

345
01:29:49,807 --> 01:30:01,017
[SPEAKER_19]: But I can't talk enough about what John Curley has done for the Medford football program these last six years.

346
01:30:01,457 --> 01:30:08,983
[SPEAKER_19]: Six years ago, Paul DeLaver, Bobby Maloney and Rachel took a chance on a first year head coach.

347
01:30:09,664 --> 01:30:13,827
[SPEAKER_19]: There was a small minute part of the city that made a lot of noise.

348
01:30:14,704 --> 01:30:16,185
[SPEAKER_19]: who aren't making any noise now.

349
01:30:16,445 --> 01:30:21,167
[SPEAKER_19]: He took this program from the worst team in the league to now the best team in the league.

350
01:30:21,967 --> 01:30:23,088
[SPEAKER_19]: He changed the culture.

351
01:30:23,748 --> 01:30:29,810
[SPEAKER_19]: He has done an amazing, he is an asset that really needs to start being tapped more in the city.

352
01:30:30,531 --> 01:30:35,593
[SPEAKER_19]: What he's done for this program, the kids, we've sent kids off to college every year to play football.

353
01:30:36,193 --> 01:30:37,774
[SPEAKER_19]: They're all graduating.

354
01:30:38,074 --> 01:30:39,734
[SPEAKER_19]: They're just doing an amazing job.

355
01:30:39,775 --> 01:30:42,836
[SPEAKER_19]: And he's doing things, he's pulling things out of these kids

356
01:30:44,008 --> 01:30:49,132
[SPEAKER_19]: We haven't seen in the city in 10, 15, 20, 50, 50 plus years.

357
01:30:49,212 --> 01:30:57,657
[SPEAKER_19]: So I had to come up here and speak about how awesome of a job he has done in this program and how proud that this city should be of him.

358
01:30:58,338 --> 01:31:10,626
[SPEAKER_19]: It should also be known, he's not gonna tell anybody, but I'm gonna, he was originally chosen to be coach of the year for the GBL, but he didn't agree with the, you know, the Revere coach had hit his hundredth win.

359
01:31:11,207 --> 01:31:13,108
[SPEAKER_19]: So he felt that that honor wasn't,

360
01:31:13,598 --> 01:31:19,105
[SPEAKER_19]: deserving him, but we all know that there isn't a better coach we could ask for.

361
01:31:19,145 --> 01:31:23,370
[SPEAKER_19]: And I especially am proud to have him in the city, and we all should.

362
01:31:23,711 --> 01:31:25,133
[SPEAKER_19]: So thank you very much for this time.

363
01:31:34,502 --> 01:31:43,568
[SPEAKER_17]: So thank you to both Coach Curley and Coach Murphy and all of the other assistant football coaches that aren't here, but I know it takes a village.

364
01:31:43,968 --> 01:31:47,731
[SPEAKER_17]: And there are a lot of you that support our football team.

365
01:31:48,391 --> 01:31:50,693
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm going to try to go through all of these names.

366
01:31:50,713 --> 01:31:51,994
[SPEAKER_17]: There's two pages of names.

390
01:35:16,646 --> 01:35:19,647

393
01:35:26,710 --> 01:35:29,053
[SPEAKER_17]: Our wonderful, wonderful marching band.

394
01:35:33,657 --> 01:35:39,243
[SPEAKER_17]: And I just want to say our marching band, you got to play for our wonderful winning football team.

395
01:35:39,263 --> 01:35:42,907
[SPEAKER_17]: So that was also, I know, motivating and encouraging because they won.

396
01:35:43,608 --> 01:35:48,153
[SPEAKER_17]: So thank you so much for your wonderful music, which helped to inspire them and keep them going as well.

401
01:36:15,313 --> 01:36:17,796
[SPEAKER_12]: I feel very supported and the kids have seen that as well.

402
01:36:17,876 --> 01:36:19,197
[SPEAKER_12]: So I appreciate you on that.

403
01:36:21,246 --> 01:36:27,387
[SPEAKER_12]: In the band world, we have this saying where it's, it takes a village and it's very, very true in the marching band.

404
01:36:27,447 --> 01:36:33,808
[SPEAKER_12]: So I also want to make sure to say thank you, a big thank you to the band Boosters and the executive board.

405
01:36:33,868 --> 01:36:36,889
[SPEAKER_12]: We have co-presidents, Mike Fowler and Michelle Whelan who are here tonight.

406
01:36:36,989 --> 01:36:37,689
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you very much.

407
01:36:43,070 --> 01:36:47,111
[SPEAKER_12]: Many of these families are, you know, collecting snacks, getting,

408
01:36:48,396 --> 01:36:58,841
[SPEAKER_12]: refreshments for the kids for during band camp back in August, and picking up the U-Haul trailer to get us where we need to go and then, you know, getting a text message from me saying, oh, it's changed.

409
01:36:59,161 --> 01:37:01,523
[SPEAKER_12]: We had to, you know, do something on the fly.

410
01:37:01,583 --> 01:37:03,544
[SPEAKER_12]: So I appreciate the parents flexibility in that.

411
01:37:06,045 --> 01:37:08,526
[SPEAKER_12]: And also thank you for everybody for letting me speak for an hour tonight.

412
01:37:08,626 --> 01:37:09,186
[SPEAKER_12]: That's amazing.

413
01:37:12,864 --> 01:37:17,788
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, so moving quickly on, I could not do it also all by myself.

414
01:37:17,848 --> 01:37:20,911
[SPEAKER_12]: So I have an amazing staff with me, many of whom are here tonight.

415
01:37:20,951 --> 01:37:25,554
[SPEAKER_12]: So if they could also stand, I have Nicole Miller and Sean Driscoll Gomez who work with the guard.

416
01:37:34,161 --> 01:37:38,965
[SPEAKER_12]: I have two percussion staff members, Jovia Marimba, who's not here tonight.

417
01:37:39,065 --> 01:37:40,707
[SPEAKER_12]: And we have Ben Whalen, who is here tonight.

418
01:37:46,024 --> 01:37:50,448
[SPEAKER_12]: And we have a visual staff member Ryan Ashanti who is moved to New York, not because of me.

419
01:37:51,749 --> 01:37:52,670
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you to those.

420
01:37:52,910 --> 01:38:00,177
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I also want to give a very big appreciation to this year's senior class of band students.

421
01:38:01,338 --> 01:38:03,340
[SPEAKER_12]: They've had a rough summer this past year.

422
01:38:03,780 --> 01:38:04,921
[SPEAKER_12]: They have pushed through.

423
01:38:04,941 --> 01:38:06,583
[SPEAKER_12]: They've been able to

424
01:38:07,541 --> 01:38:12,004
[SPEAKER_12]: show what it means to really put their best foot forward, no pun intended, but pun intended.

425
01:38:12,484 --> 01:38:14,685
[SPEAKER_12]: So the senior class here has been amazing.

426
01:38:14,845 --> 01:38:21,609
[SPEAKER_12]: They've done it with, you know, grace and dignity and pride and power, which is what the Medford band is known for.

427
01:38:21,689 --> 01:38:23,511
[SPEAKER_12]: So senior class, very good job.

428
01:38:23,551 --> 01:38:24,291
[SPEAKER_12]: I appreciate you.

429
01:38:31,615 --> 01:38:34,297
[SPEAKER_12]: Going into this year, there was a little bit of, you know,

430
01:38:36,291 --> 01:38:42,116
[SPEAKER_12]: a lot to live up to because they were the reigning champions of division two for New England's Classic Band Association.

431
01:38:42,196 --> 01:38:44,117
[SPEAKER_12]: And they did a fantastic job this year as well.

432
01:38:44,798 --> 01:38:50,442
[SPEAKER_12]: And not only did they defend it, but they are one of only two bands to get platinum rating in all of New England.

433
01:38:50,502 --> 01:38:53,185
[SPEAKER_12]: So they got a gold medal with platinum rating.

434
01:38:59,350 --> 01:39:06,075
[SPEAKER_12]: At championships, they won best general effect, best visual, best color guard, which is nothing new to this band.

435
01:39:07,542 --> 01:39:12,746
[SPEAKER_12]: And they won for the first time in school history, best drum majors with Kean, Liao, and Ben Vertz.

436
01:39:20,412 --> 01:39:24,235
[SPEAKER_12]: And then as we move into the next season, we have our competitive group.

437
01:39:25,041 --> 01:39:29,542
[SPEAKER_12]: The winter guard is moving into national a class this year, which is a tougher division.

438
01:39:30,063 --> 01:39:33,884
[SPEAKER_12]: And we have our indoor percussion group that's also moving into national a class as well.

439
01:39:33,944 --> 01:39:41,666
[SPEAKER_12]: So even though marching season's over, we're still competing and you'll see us at the football, I'm sorry, men's and women's basketball games and hockey games.

440
01:39:41,726 --> 01:39:43,647
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you very much for that time.

441
01:39:43,867 --> 01:39:46,368
[SPEAKER_12]: And I appreciate your allowing me to work with him.

442
01:39:49,869 --> 01:39:50,309
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

443
01:39:53,246 --> 01:39:56,529
[SPEAKER_17]: So wonderful Medford Mustang Marching Band members.

444
01:39:57,370 --> 01:40:01,573
[SPEAKER_17]: Forgive me if I do mess up your names, but I'm going to try my very best.

445
01:40:02,134 --> 01:40:18,729
[SPEAKER_17]: Elijah Ademach, John Marco Artates, Nobutaka Ashihara, Amelia O'Reilly, Oumania Benalia, Abigail Shelton, Mandy Chow, Andrew Colbert,

446
01:40:19,710 --> 01:40:39,861
[SPEAKER_17]: Lucia Sataki, Adam Dangy, Beatrice Davis, Christine Desotel, Giovanna Donasimento, Ann Dups, Annabelle Foster, Charlotte Foti, Topper Fowler, Maggie Fowler, Violet Freimark, Davis Freimark,

447
01:40:40,751 --> 01:41:06,761
[SPEAKER_17]: Gemma Gudino, Aria Guscott, Sydney Hamill, Alexandra Hopper, Talia Ingano, Declan Kane, Lennox LaFleur, Jovian LaFleur, Kian Lau, Tahia Leitz, T-A-J-I-A, please forgive me, Harrison Mumma, Colin Murray, Rowan Mustone,

448
01:41:08,183 --> 01:41:25,961
[SPEAKER_17]: Aya Najjar, Maeve Nicholas, Addison Nietzsche, Peter Noel, Isabel Oliveira, Deja Parkinson, Bathaya Pierce, Stanley Tang, Benjamin Vurs, Jonas Vurs, Jane Wyman, and Maria Zasra.

449
01:41:28,143 --> 01:41:32,067
[SPEAKER_17]: All coaching support, and Mr. Dampia, please come forward.

450
01:41:41,938 --> 01:41:44,600
[SPEAKER_07]: Guys in the very front, you're going to have to stand up a little bit.

451
01:41:44,640 --> 01:41:49,484
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to have to get up a little bit.

452
01:41:49,544 --> 01:41:50,145
A little bit.

453
01:41:50,205 --> 01:41:53,247
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't see all these pillars.

454
01:41:53,307 --> 01:42:00,893
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

455
01:42:30,336 --> 01:42:31,839
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we're live.

456
01:43:50,493 --> 01:44:03,650
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's good.

457
01:44:03,730 --> 01:44:04,411
[SPEAKER_17]: Nothing to say.

458
01:44:04,431 --> 01:44:04,531
[SPEAKER_17]: Good.

459
01:45:25,549 --> 01:45:26,569
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't believe they didn't stay.

460
01:45:28,210 --> 01:45:28,850
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you hear me?

461
01:45:28,950 --> 01:45:29,371
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you hear me?

462
01:45:30,471 --> 01:45:31,191
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you hear me now?

463
01:45:34,333 --> 01:45:37,994
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you hear me now?

464
01:45:41,996 --> 01:45:42,316
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

465
01:45:46,277 --> 01:45:52,420
[SPEAKER_10]: We have recommendation to approve HVAC project by Dr. Peter J. Cushing, assistant superintendent of schools.

466
01:45:52,640 --> 01:45:52,920
[SPEAKER_10]: Welcome.

467
01:45:58,430 --> 01:45:58,690
[SPEAKER_20]: Test.

468
01:45:58,750 --> 01:45:59,271
[SPEAKER_20]: OK.

469
01:46:00,972 --> 01:46:07,658
[SPEAKER_15]: Also with me today is Alicia Hunt from the city side, director of planning, development, and sustainability.

470
01:46:08,419 --> 01:46:16,706
[SPEAKER_15]: So over the last several years, we have provided updates on the various states of our HVAC systems across the district.

471
01:46:16,726 --> 01:46:20,749
[SPEAKER_15]: For those who don't know, HVAC is heating, ventilation, and air conditioning.

472
01:46:22,010 --> 01:46:23,411
[SPEAKER_15]: And I will dive right in.

473
01:46:26,243 --> 01:46:28,584
[SPEAKER_15]: Why are we presenting this and why are we doing this work?

474
01:46:28,624 --> 01:46:31,065
[SPEAKER_15]: So the Midland and the Andrews opened in 2001.

475
01:46:31,686 --> 01:46:35,127
[SPEAKER_15]: HVAC systems, similar to other building systems, have a lifespan.

476
01:46:35,808 --> 01:46:39,910
[SPEAKER_15]: It is commonly thought of and still spoken that these are the new schools in Medford.

477
01:46:40,710 --> 01:46:50,695
[SPEAKER_15]: Hopefully with Medford High School in a few years, that will no longer be the case, but these are buildings that are aging and buildings need love, care, and repair.

478
01:46:51,255 --> 01:47:06,761
[SPEAKER_15]: Medford has operated under a deferred maintenance or fix when broken maintenance budgeting for a significant period of time, our work with Mr. McHugh, and Mr. Ricky on the city side is really shifting our movement away from that type of budgeting approach.

479
01:47:07,881 --> 01:47:12,803
[SPEAKER_15]: building systems should be and will be moving forward covered under preventative maintenance contracts.

480
01:47:12,863 --> 01:47:14,724
[SPEAKER_15]: I just want to give the committee a quick update on that.

481
01:47:15,124 --> 01:47:16,224
[SPEAKER_15]: We've toured all the schools.

482
01:47:16,264 --> 01:47:24,947
[SPEAKER_15]: We've built a list of contracts that need to be in place and working with Mr. McHugh and Mr. Riggie, we're also moving forward on those.

483
01:47:26,207 --> 01:47:29,689
[SPEAKER_15]: Building HVAC systems should be recommissioned every five years.

484
01:47:30,289 --> 01:47:35,131
[SPEAKER_15]: The systems in these two buildings appear to have only been recommissioned once in 2010.

485
01:47:38,050 --> 01:47:46,534
[SPEAKER_15]: Annual startup and repairs have been handled internally and through some HVAC trained vendors, primarily Arctic Engineering.

486
01:47:48,015 --> 01:47:51,457
[SPEAKER_15]: Systems are currently in various stages of failure in both of these schools.

487
01:47:52,318 --> 01:47:57,080
[SPEAKER_15]: The McGlynn, surprisingly, when we started this work, our work was focused really on the injuries.

488
01:47:57,861 --> 01:48:03,584
[SPEAKER_15]: The McGlynn did not want to be left out and has definitely taken the lead in failed and failing systems.

489
01:48:04,691 --> 01:48:08,912
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, building construction and commissioning have evolved in the years since construction.

490
01:48:09,072 --> 01:48:15,693
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's a much, it's a much more, I would say, deliberate science and deliberate work that needs to be undertaken.

491
01:48:16,373 --> 01:48:26,155
[SPEAKER_15]: That commissioning and work that needs to remain with the district after this project is done is part of our budgeting and part of our plan for this project.

492
01:48:26,395 --> 01:48:31,916
[SPEAKER_15]: So the systems won't simply be turned on on day one and then left for us to deal with.

493
01:48:32,156 --> 01:48:32,936
[SPEAKER_15]: We will be trained.

494
01:48:33,436 --> 01:48:37,097
[SPEAKER_15]: we will be taught and to properly manage the system.

495
01:48:37,598 --> 01:48:42,479
[SPEAKER_15]: Pandemic health and safety measures have really illustrated the overall challenges with these systems.

496
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:45,120
[SPEAKER_15]: We increased the MERV value.

497
01:48:45,160 --> 01:48:50,542
[SPEAKER_15]: If you remember from four years ago, MERV values, four and a half years now, shocking.

498
01:48:51,083 --> 01:48:55,424
[SPEAKER_15]: So we put filters in these systems that the systems weren't designed to handle.

499
01:48:56,345 --> 01:48:59,266
[SPEAKER_15]: So that can cause problems with airflow and other issues.

500
01:48:59,826 --> 01:49:02,247
[SPEAKER_15]: And systems, these systems in particular,

501
01:49:03,307 --> 01:49:05,148
[SPEAKER_15]: are built on R-22 refrigerant.

502
01:49:05,888 --> 01:49:10,871
[SPEAKER_15]: This is, as I've said previously here, a banned refrigerant by the EPA.

503
01:49:11,311 --> 01:49:13,232
[SPEAKER_15]: It is no longer produced in the United States.

504
01:49:13,292 --> 01:49:15,573
[SPEAKER_15]: It can no longer be imported to the United States.

505
01:49:16,113 --> 01:49:24,817
[SPEAKER_15]: And finally, it can only be from existing stores, purchased from existing stores or from reclaimed systems.

506
01:49:25,317 --> 01:49:27,438
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, moving forward.

507
01:49:27,819 --> 01:49:28,019
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

508
01:49:28,319 --> 01:49:28,659
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, sorry.

509
01:49:29,292 --> 01:49:30,873
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, so just our past work.

510
01:49:31,053 --> 01:49:32,913
[SPEAKER_15]: Here's a calendar of where we've been.

511
01:49:32,933 --> 01:49:36,335
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not going to go through this in great detail.

512
01:49:37,235 --> 01:49:40,656
[SPEAKER_15]: But we've been working with an OPM contractor.

513
01:49:40,797 --> 01:49:42,177
[SPEAKER_15]: We've been working with a designer.

514
01:49:42,717 --> 01:49:46,899
[SPEAKER_15]: We had some delays at the start due to contracts and legal reviews.

515
01:49:47,859 --> 01:50:10,547
[SPEAKER_15]: But we have been able to begin as of late August with every single week design meetings where comprehensive decisions are being made with the best information possible and considering what budgets look like and operating under the best information possible to bring the most efficient systems online for our school districts.

516
01:50:11,588 --> 01:50:13,069
[SPEAKER_15]: So you can see where we are.

517
01:50:13,109 --> 01:50:16,653
[SPEAKER_15]: We've pre-qualified four construction managers at this point.

518
01:50:17,354 --> 01:50:20,858
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll be moving forward to make a decision on those four construction managers.

519
01:50:21,639 --> 01:50:30,548
[SPEAKER_15]: And then as of just last week, our McGlynn schematic design is at 30% and the Andrews schematic design is 100% complete.

520
01:50:32,610 --> 01:50:34,110
[SPEAKER_15]: You can see where we are right now.

521
01:50:34,771 --> 01:50:40,592
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll be submitting our inspector general application for CM at risk, procurement approved.

522
01:50:41,312 --> 01:50:46,774
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll be looking for a contract for construction manager in February and pre-purchase of some equipment.

523
01:50:47,274 --> 01:50:51,935
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll be talking a little bit about the pre-purchase of equipment as well as we move forward tonight.

524
01:50:53,455 --> 01:50:57,797
[SPEAKER_15]: In March, I could have a best budget estimate for the next bond approval.

525
01:50:57,977 --> 01:51:10,962
[SPEAKER_15]: We're here tonight to really get the school committee to look to ask the city council through the mayor and her administration for that bond, that first bond that is required for this work to continue.

526
01:51:11,562 --> 01:51:14,385
[SPEAKER_15]: Spring of 2025, preparation for construction.

527
01:51:15,145 --> 01:51:25,535
[SPEAKER_15]: We've already planned a January 7th meeting with principals for logistics to make sure that there's no impact to our daily operations when it comes to academics in the buildings.

528
01:51:26,316 --> 01:51:34,003
[SPEAKER_15]: Summer 2025 will be disruptive construction, classroom heating and cooling, not hopefully, will be available by the end of the summer.

529
01:51:34,843 --> 01:51:37,425
[SPEAKER_15]: Definitely the cooling, the heating.

530
01:51:37,825 --> 01:51:44,110
[SPEAKER_15]: We have a little bit more runway through September and October if needed, but definitely classroom cooling.

531
01:51:44,130 --> 01:51:56,899
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to be clear about that classroom cooling, which we call the water side versus the air side, but the water side cooling will be available and then fall 2025 finalized construction commissioning and close out.

532
01:51:57,915 --> 01:51:59,116
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, acting now.

533
01:51:59,576 --> 01:52:05,881
[SPEAKER_15]: So our goal of providing classroom cooling for the start of the school year is still a realistic and attainable goal.

534
01:52:05,901 --> 01:52:21,392
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, that is something that that's why we're moving quickly in this area is because we've had several cooling seasons in the past several years, particularly in the start of the year, that have been more troublesome than the end of the year.

535
01:52:23,514 --> 01:52:28,479
[SPEAKER_15]: Approving funding now allows equipment to be ordered construction manager at risk.

536
01:52:29,059 --> 01:52:32,502
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry construction management requires about $300,000.

537
01:52:32,962 --> 01:52:38,827
[SPEAKER_15]: At this point, construction managers then authorized to pre purchase the known equipment with encumbered funds.

538
01:52:40,075 --> 01:52:43,937
[SPEAKER_15]: I understand this next line might be controversial for some people, but it's the truth.

539
01:52:44,637 --> 01:52:53,742
[SPEAKER_15]: We have no idea what the numbers that I will present this evening, what the impending federal administration's tariffs may do to the overall cost of this project.

540
01:52:54,362 --> 01:53:00,765
[SPEAKER_15]: They have not been considered, but it is a reality that we are going to have to be prepared for.

541
01:53:01,306 --> 01:53:07,909
[SPEAKER_15]: And what we hope is by pre-ordering now, that we may be able to avoid any tariffs on this equipment.

542
01:53:11,049 --> 01:53:13,051
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's an unknown variable at this point.

543
01:53:13,171 --> 01:53:22,639
[SPEAKER_15]: Phase one funding, the request of this committee tonight and the city council tomorrow is a $5 million bond request.

544
01:53:23,180 --> 01:53:30,786
[SPEAKER_15]: Completing construction documents will, the funds here will be used for completing construction documents and early bid package

545
01:53:31,847 --> 01:53:38,569
[SPEAKER_15]: continued OPM services, the CM pre-construction services, and equipment pre-purchase.

546
01:53:38,709 --> 01:53:57,974
[SPEAKER_15]: Again, that equipment pre-purchase is critical so that we have the equipment not only on hand because of the tariff situation, but also on hand so that we are ahead of those ordering schedules and that we'll actually be ready to install and deploy and commission these units for those first days of school.

547
01:53:59,616 --> 01:54:09,622
[SPEAKER_15]: Phase two funding, again, in more detail, we'll be back before this body and the city council again for in the neighborhood of 23 to $27 million.

548
01:54:10,763 --> 01:54:18,628
[SPEAKER_15]: Where we are in the process right now requires us to have a lot of contingencies in there.

549
01:54:18,808 --> 01:54:25,072
[SPEAKER_15]: There's, I believe if I remember correctly, in the neighborhood of $4 million of contingencies.

550
01:54:25,865 --> 01:54:31,847
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, we're being extraordinarily conservative in our decisions that we're making.

551
01:54:32,688 --> 01:54:35,049
[SPEAKER_15]: We're not building gold-plated systems.

552
01:54:35,129 --> 01:54:38,290
[SPEAKER_15]: We're not acting in a manner that is fiscally irresponsible.

553
01:54:38,690 --> 01:54:45,072
[SPEAKER_15]: However, where we are in the construction phasing right now requires us to have those large contingencies.

554
01:54:47,967 --> 01:55:02,747
[SPEAKER_15]: Phase two funding, again, $23 to $27 million, which is really contingent once the construction manager comes on, the construction management firm comes on for cost estimating, the roof replacement

555
01:55:03,708 --> 01:55:08,329
[SPEAKER_15]: slash refurbishment, a replacement would be in the neighborhood of $2.8 to $3 million.

556
01:55:09,310 --> 01:55:21,833
[SPEAKER_15]: Brenda Pike, who works in Alicia's office, has done some really good work in looking at what our actual cost savings of energy would be by adding new insulation, upgrading the insulation and doing a new roof.

557
01:55:22,600 --> 01:55:32,806
[SPEAKER_15]: It pales in comparison and is not fiscally responsible to do the full roof replacement, given the short money we'll get back on the additional $1.5 million.

558
01:55:33,527 --> 01:55:46,174
[SPEAKER_15]: So it would be about $2.8, $2.9, $3 million for a new roof with new insulation versus similar to what was done at the Andrews a few years ago, which is called a White Knight application.

559
01:55:46,614 --> 01:55:49,456
[SPEAKER_15]: Jerry, if I have that name wrong, but the White Knight application.

560
01:55:49,976 --> 01:55:57,657
[SPEAKER_15]: which they go in, they repair any spots that need to be, and then put, for lack of a better term, a film over the entire roof that has a 20-year warranty.

561
01:55:58,077 --> 01:56:05,559
[SPEAKER_15]: A new roof has a 20-year warranty, this has a 20-year warranty, and comes in in the neighborhood of $1.4 to $1.5 million.

562
01:56:06,379 --> 01:56:10,760
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's fiscally responsible for us to act in that manner.

563
01:56:11,900 --> 01:56:18,261
[SPEAKER_15]: And then solar installation at both schools, the solar installation at the Andrews with a solar battery,

564
01:56:19,168 --> 01:56:20,429
[SPEAKER_15]: is covered under ARPA.

565
01:56:21,370 --> 01:56:24,553
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Madam Mayor and members of the City Council for that.

566
01:56:25,994 --> 01:56:29,097
[SPEAKER_15]: The tentative is the McGlynn.

567
01:56:29,377 --> 01:56:36,884
[SPEAKER_15]: That's really looking at in the neighborhood of an additional $1.2 million that is not factored in these numbers tonight.

568
01:56:37,024 --> 01:56:38,506
[SPEAKER_15]: It's there as an ad alternate.

569
01:56:40,147 --> 01:56:55,555
[SPEAKER_15]: I now want to take a moment, we also have our construction, our onus project manager, Tom Ellis, Brenda here, but I also want to take a moment to offer Alicia, if I have missed anything, to step to the podium because she and her office have been really phenomenal in helping with this.

570
01:56:55,975 --> 01:57:06,040
[SPEAKER_15]: Paul Riggi has been on every call with us and has really been helping the school side to make sure that this project moves through towards completion in a very timely manner.

571
01:57:06,971 --> 01:57:09,073
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to say thank you and good evening.

572
01:57:09,314 --> 01:57:11,476
[SPEAKER_03]: And if there's any questions that were here.

573
01:57:12,237 --> 01:57:18,884
[SPEAKER_03]: I was the project manager on the roof at the Andrew school so I'm very familiar with that and the system we're recommending at this time.

574
01:57:18,904 --> 01:57:21,547
[SPEAKER_03]: I just sort of wanted to mention about the solar.

575
01:57:22,348 --> 01:57:27,333
[SPEAKER_03]: So, at this time the Andrew school is going forward with the solar array, not a battery.

576
01:57:28,598 --> 01:57:36,143
[SPEAKER_03]: For long complicated reasons but basically it was not cost effective and it didn't make sense to do it wasn't fiscally responsible anymore.

577
01:57:37,304 --> 01:57:42,947
[SPEAKER_03]: The solar at the school at the McGlynn what we have found is that when we make it an ad alternate.

578
01:57:44,648 --> 01:57:52,174
[SPEAKER_03]: through new construction, they often will offer to do the solar array at a much lower rate than if it was a standalone project.

579
01:57:52,994 --> 01:57:56,817
[SPEAKER_03]: But by saying that it's an ad alternate, they know that we could actually say no to them.

580
01:57:57,237 --> 01:58:01,641
[SPEAKER_03]: And they also don't want to lose the electrical sub-bid by bidding too high on it.

581
01:58:01,781 --> 01:58:03,542
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's sort of a strategic thing.

582
01:58:04,242 --> 01:58:06,664
[SPEAKER_03]: And we would honestly just look at what the pricing is.

583
01:58:07,044 --> 01:58:09,006
[SPEAKER_03]: If for some reason it came in too high,

584
01:58:09,946 --> 01:58:12,328
[SPEAKER_03]: We would then just not take it.

585
01:58:12,608 --> 01:58:28,039
[SPEAKER_03]: We're also expecting with both solar projects that we would get money back from the federal government through what as if you are a homeowner would be a tax credit as a municipality, it is now called direct pay, and it is 30% of the cost.

586
01:58:30,160 --> 01:58:32,401
[SPEAKER_03]: That is how the tax code is written right now.

587
01:58:33,222 --> 01:58:37,344
[SPEAKER_03]: As we move into the new year, we're expecting the tax code would be written that way.

588
01:58:38,084 --> 01:58:48,810
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are hoping that everything will go smoothly, and that by the time we are looking at the actual bids on this, we will have a little bit more certainty around that, and then we can take that into account

589
01:58:49,270 --> 01:58:51,632
[SPEAKER_03]: and then look at that number that way as well.

590
01:58:52,072 --> 01:59:00,859
[SPEAKER_03]: So if there's anything in the whole project though we have Brenda and Tom here with us and I do believe we have our designer on the Zoom or is that tomorrow night he's going to be on the Zoom?

591
01:59:02,500 --> 01:59:06,883
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah the designer is available if there are any questions that get real technical.

592
01:59:07,523 --> 01:59:07,984
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

593
01:59:09,805 --> 01:59:13,928
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm happy to answer we're happy to take questions or I can run through the numbers however you'd like to handle them.

594
01:59:14,429 --> 01:59:15,450
[SPEAKER_10]: No, thank you, Dr. Cushing.

595
01:59:15,470 --> 01:59:19,273
[SPEAKER_10]: And thank you, Director Hunt, Member Ruseau, and then Member Reinfeld.

596
01:59:19,973 --> 01:59:20,394
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

597
01:59:21,635 --> 01:59:29,441
[SPEAKER_21]: I was really happy to hear that the savings from the improved installation of a replacement was calculated.

598
01:59:30,361 --> 01:59:33,744
[SPEAKER_21]: So over 20 years, that doesn't come to a million dollars in savings.

599
01:59:36,026 --> 01:59:41,269
[SPEAKER_15]: I defer to Brenda, but I think the savings came in the neighborhood of, if I remember correctly, $350,000 or so.

600
01:59:44,111 --> 01:59:47,777
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, yeah, she had done it a few weeks ago.

601
01:59:47,797 --> 01:59:49,399
[SPEAKER_21]: It wasn't anywhere near a million.

602
01:59:49,439 --> 01:59:49,920
[SPEAKER_15]: Nowhere near.

603
01:59:50,200 --> 01:59:50,500
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, okay.

604
01:59:50,621 --> 01:59:51,181
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, that's fine.

605
01:59:51,362 --> 01:59:51,722
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

606
01:59:54,105 --> 01:59:54,426
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

607
01:59:54,726 --> 01:59:55,928
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, Member Reinfeld.

608
01:59:59,662 --> 02:00:00,363
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, minor quick.

609
02:00:01,745 --> 02:00:03,827
[SPEAKER_14]: When will the McGlynn schematic get to 100%?

610
02:00:03,947 --> 02:00:05,229
[SPEAKER_14]: How does that?

611
02:00:05,249 --> 02:00:06,250
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want me to actually?

612
02:00:06,310 --> 02:00:10,936
[SPEAKER_03]: So the way it works is there's SD design and the full design.

613
02:00:11,236 --> 02:00:14,780
[SPEAKER_03]: So actually, both of them are at complete schematic designs.

614
02:00:15,321 --> 02:00:17,604
[SPEAKER_03]: And now the next tranche of money

615
02:00:18,104 --> 02:00:21,027
[SPEAKER_03]: is to pay the designer to take them to 100% design.

616
02:00:21,407 --> 02:00:30,276
[SPEAKER_03]: With a contractor at risk, a construction manager at risk process, the construction manager is part of that final design.

617
02:00:30,636 --> 02:00:32,718
[SPEAKER_03]: So part of the strategy is to bring him on.

618
02:00:33,098 --> 02:00:36,201
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thought that I would mention that's new for Medford to do it this way.

619
02:00:36,541 --> 02:00:38,423
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a number of good reasons to do

620
02:00:40,584 --> 02:00:42,565
[SPEAKER_03]: construction manager at risk process.

621
02:00:43,045 --> 02:00:44,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Tom can really speak to that.

622
02:00:44,425 --> 02:00:45,165
[SPEAKER_03]: He's the expert.

623
02:00:45,185 --> 02:00:46,846
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we've made that decision.

624
02:00:47,186 --> 02:00:58,089
[SPEAKER_03]: But a piece of it that really resonated for me here is that when they built these buildings, they didn't really design them to take this HVAC system out and put a new one in.

625
02:00:58,609 --> 02:01:03,110
[SPEAKER_03]: So some of the work that needs to be done is retrofitting into an existing space.

626
02:01:03,570 --> 02:01:13,517
[SPEAKER_03]: So having the person who is going to manage the construction be part of the design is super helpful because he can look at it and say, you can't do that.

627
02:01:14,117 --> 02:01:15,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do it this way.

628
02:01:15,658 --> 02:01:16,959
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it's not a change order.

629
02:01:17,180 --> 02:01:18,200
[SPEAKER_03]: It's part of the design.

630
02:01:18,661 --> 02:01:24,665
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is, we will finalize the CMs at risk in January, bring them on board in February.

631
02:01:25,465 --> 02:01:28,866
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he will be part of the final design of the project.

632
02:01:28,886 --> 02:01:30,346
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's all built into this timeline.

633
02:01:30,406 --> 02:01:31,546
[SPEAKER_03]: It's built into this timeline.

634
02:01:31,566 --> 02:01:36,108
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to make sure this isn't going to introduce some new delays unexpectedly.

635
02:01:36,128 --> 02:01:36,288
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

636
02:01:36,388 --> 02:01:39,168
[SPEAKER_14]: This is how this timeline is built is to do it this way.

637
02:01:39,428 --> 02:01:48,510
[SPEAKER_14]: And then I'm wondering if you can comment on the in-classroom experience in the hot months of May and June and what are we looking at?

638
02:01:48,610 --> 02:01:49,951
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't have a great solution.

639
02:01:49,971 --> 02:01:50,051
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

640
02:01:51,571 --> 02:02:05,955
[SPEAKER_15]: One of the things that we had considered was do we bring in supplemental cooling and the reality is, is that would only cause the costs balloon further and give given where we've been the last few years.

641
02:02:06,482 --> 02:02:18,432
[SPEAKER_14]: May and June have not been... Well, we usually have like two to five really brutal days and that's when everyone gets hot and angry, hot and bothered, should we say?

642
02:02:18,653 --> 02:02:24,378
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, and it's September... In reality though, it's September and August and even parts of October.

643
02:02:24,818 --> 02:02:31,543
[SPEAKER_15]: have been the more challenging for, especially me standing at this podium the last few years, talking about those issues.

644
02:02:32,423 --> 02:02:38,988
[SPEAKER_15]: But and for everyone in the, I don't mean to make light of it, everyone in the classrooms, it is a degree of suffering.

645
02:02:40,229 --> 02:02:44,071
[SPEAKER_15]: And we hope what this is is that this spring will be the last time.

646
02:02:45,032 --> 02:02:48,454
[SPEAKER_15]: The costs associated with supplemental cooling, I explored them last year.

647
02:02:48,534 --> 02:02:50,596
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't have them at the ready, but they are significant.

648
02:02:51,016 --> 02:03:00,259
[SPEAKER_15]: and the hundreds of thousands of dollars, you know, craning in, putting on the roof units from various rental companies, making sure that you order them in advance.

649
02:03:00,699 --> 02:03:08,061
[SPEAKER_15]: If you want them back in September, if needed, you have to pay for them over the summer, because as soon as they go out, someone else is requesting them.

650
02:03:09,101 --> 02:03:12,062
[SPEAKER_15]: So there are significant costs associated with just that.

651
02:03:12,648 --> 02:03:19,495
[SPEAKER_14]: I just, I wanna be ready and anticipating what things are gonna be like and being able to tell people, this is why it is this way.

652
02:03:20,756 --> 02:03:29,764
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think we've been, no, I think we've been suffering with some heat waves, especially at the Andrews, now the McGlynn for several years.

653
02:03:29,864 --> 02:03:35,249
[SPEAKER_10]: So all we can attest to is that, to people that we're taking this very seriously, I think,

654
02:03:36,050 --> 02:04:02,182
[SPEAKER_10]: let oh less than a year ago I said to director hunt we need to make this a priority and it's been a stressful couple months for the whole team trying to get this done so that it's um the construction work is done by the end of the summer and it will at least save us so we can definitely just attest to our residents and our parents that this has been a priority of the entire school committee as well as the city administration and the school administration and it's it's

655
02:04:02,862 --> 02:04:06,985
[SPEAKER_10]: The good news is it's going to get done hopefully without any hot days in June.

656
02:04:07,505 --> 02:04:17,631
[SPEAKER_15]: I also do want to be crystal clear with everybody that this will guarantee that the classroom cooling is done for this guarantee as much as we can guarantee anything.

657
02:04:18,091 --> 02:04:27,317
[SPEAKER_15]: But this will guarantee that the classroom cooling is ready for the start of the year, which is the water side, the air side, which is larger spaces, gym, auditorium,

658
02:04:28,197 --> 02:04:34,087
[SPEAKER_15]: cafeteria offices will be behind that by a little bit.

659
02:04:34,327 --> 02:04:40,517
[SPEAKER_15]: But the water side, which is classrooms, will be done by that end of August.

660
02:04:42,861 --> 02:04:59,708
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just sort of wanted to add, because I think Dr. Cushing kind of glossed over this, that the team, including Dr. Cushing and Brenda and sometimes myself, has been meeting weekly with active construction work since at least August, if it wasn't, they didn't start meeting in July.

661
02:05:00,129 --> 02:05:03,530
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just want people to realize, well, why didn't they do anything?

662
02:05:03,630 --> 02:05:04,470
[SPEAKER_03]: They just showed up here.

663
02:05:04,511 --> 02:05:07,972
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want you to be able to say that that is, in fact, the case.

664
02:05:08,392 --> 02:05:09,393
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's been really,

665
02:05:10,413 --> 02:05:11,834
[SPEAKER_03]: churning as much as possible.

666
02:05:12,354 --> 02:05:15,956
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and we didn't want to come forward for money until we had a solid numbers.

667
02:05:16,857 --> 02:05:26,802
[SPEAKER_03]: And we really wanted to ask for the whole amount, but we said we can't, we need to start money now and we'll need to do when we'll have more solid numbers in the March, April, and we'll come back.

668
02:05:27,122 --> 02:05:32,185
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want anybody to think that when we come back in April, why did they say that now?

669
02:05:32,285 --> 02:05:33,245
[SPEAKER_03]: How come they're changing?

670
02:05:33,305 --> 02:05:34,286
[SPEAKER_03]: This isn't a change.

671
02:05:34,346 --> 02:05:35,186
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a plan.

672
02:05:35,306 --> 02:05:36,587
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just want to be clear about that.

673
02:05:39,304 --> 02:05:40,585
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Ruseau, then Member Graham.

674
02:05:40,986 --> 02:05:41,726
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

675
02:05:41,766 --> 02:05:46,131
[SPEAKER_21]: Have we communicated with our rentals in those buildings or the McGlynn?

676
02:05:47,512 --> 02:05:49,194
[SPEAKER_15]: We have not yet, but we will.

677
02:05:49,254 --> 02:05:59,203
[SPEAKER_15]: And the reason is, is because I really want to get through the logistics meeting with the principals on January 7th so that we have a really clear understanding of what the work is.

678
02:06:02,236 --> 02:06:11,962
[SPEAKER_15]: The other quick factor here is when these buildings were built in 2001, long after the Americans with Disabilities Act passed.

679
02:06:12,482 --> 02:06:15,323
[SPEAKER_15]: So they are largely up to standard.

680
02:06:16,444 --> 02:06:23,108
[SPEAKER_15]: There are some challenges in particular, one which will be discussed later on this evening, but it's the front plaza has settled.

681
02:06:24,308 --> 02:06:30,012
[SPEAKER_15]: And so they need to be mitigated, replaced, something along those lines.

682
02:06:30,712 --> 02:06:38,603
[SPEAKER_15]: When you do a construction project on an existing building and it exceeds 30% of the assessed value of the buildings.

683
02:06:40,621 --> 02:06:45,104
[SPEAKER_15]: you have to make sure that you upgrade your Americans with Disabilities Act code.

684
02:06:45,865 --> 02:07:07,480
[SPEAKER_15]: So that'll mean at a minimum, front doors will need a push button, so the doors will actuate and open, but also replacing or mitigating those concrete areas, which I have called the front plazas of those schools, because they have settled across the front of both buildings, and now the buildings are not accessible.

685
02:07:08,140 --> 02:07:08,440
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

686
02:07:11,348 --> 02:07:15,731
[SPEAKER_21]: It's almost a silly question, but I assume much of this equipment is manufactured in China.

687
02:07:17,573 --> 02:07:18,553
[SPEAKER_15]: I actually would defer.

688
02:07:18,573 --> 02:07:21,235
[SPEAKER_15]: Hold on.

689
02:07:21,556 --> 02:07:24,558
[SPEAKER_22]: It's assembled here in the US, but some of it is outside.

690
02:07:25,659 --> 02:07:26,299
[SPEAKER_22]: The bottom mic.

691
02:07:27,500 --> 02:07:29,541
[SPEAKER_03]: Give me the mic so they can't hear you on the TV.

692
02:07:32,824 --> 02:07:34,365
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, this is Tom Ellis.

693
02:07:34,385 --> 02:07:37,547
[SPEAKER_22]: Hi, I'm Tom Ellis with the JLL, the owner's project manager.

694
02:07:38,008 --> 02:07:38,848
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, I think right now,

695
02:07:40,481 --> 02:07:58,771
[SPEAKER_22]: There are a lot of products manufactured and assembled all over the place right now we're working with a number the design teams working with a number of manufacturers to just determine kind of what products are out there, but are readily available and so we're working with a lot of the manufacturers to be sure we have the best availability and in performance so.

696
02:07:59,508 --> 02:08:03,851
[SPEAKER_22]: Some of them are that way, but most of them are like 20 to 24 weeks.

697
02:08:04,131 --> 02:08:07,434
[SPEAKER_22]: So some of them are long for the airside equipment.

698
02:08:07,454 --> 02:08:09,515
[SPEAKER_22]: That's why it's important to get this ordered early.

699
02:08:10,496 --> 02:08:10,796
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

700
02:08:10,816 --> 02:08:11,156
[SPEAKER_21]: Don't leave.

701
02:08:11,176 --> 02:08:11,797
[SPEAKER_21]: I have another question.

702
02:08:11,817 --> 02:08:12,517
[SPEAKER_21]: I think you'll answer.

703
02:08:12,778 --> 02:08:19,683
[SPEAKER_21]: Are companies hedging their bets and increasing prices in anticipation of tariffs?

704
02:08:19,823 --> 02:08:21,524
[SPEAKER_21]: And how does that work contractually?

705
02:08:21,544 --> 02:08:28,549
[SPEAKER_21]: So if we say we want a piece of equipment that will arrive in 24 weeks, we sign the contract.

706
02:08:29,633 --> 02:08:34,258
[SPEAKER_21]: By the time it's on its way over, the price is 25% more.

707
02:08:34,558 --> 02:08:35,659
[SPEAKER_21]: Are we on the hook for that?

708
02:08:35,819 --> 02:08:40,264
[SPEAKER_21]: Or is the company just crying as they hand over a piece of equipment?

709
02:08:40,885 --> 02:08:45,409
[SPEAKER_21]: How does that work with tariffs when you've ordered something before the tariff begins?

710
02:08:45,510 --> 02:08:46,671
[SPEAKER_21]: And if you don't know, just ask.

711
02:08:46,691 --> 02:08:52,517
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, it's anybody's guess on what's going to happen with respect to tariffs, what's going to be applied, what's going to be

712
02:08:53,287 --> 02:08:56,408
[SPEAKER_22]: grandfathered or not, things are not applied.

713
02:08:56,708 --> 02:09:06,532
[SPEAKER_22]: The bottom line is once we sign a contract, I think the numbers we're carrying for our budget includes what's anticipated to be some type of an annual increase for manufacturing costs.

714
02:09:06,892 --> 02:09:09,153
[SPEAKER_22]: So we've factored in some of those numbers.

715
02:09:09,633 --> 02:09:13,995
[SPEAKER_22]: But the impact of tariffs, you know, the goal is let's get out there and try to get them ordered as soon as

716
02:09:14,431 --> 02:09:24,587
[SPEAKER_22]: We can so that we minimize whatever impact might happen, there may be limited or there may be a significant at this stage we don't really know so we're trying to get.

717
02:09:25,785 --> 02:09:32,207
[SPEAKER_22]: get in control those things we can control, which means get things ordered as soon as we can and then minimize the impact.

718
02:09:32,247 --> 02:09:36,749
[SPEAKER_22]: So that allows us to focus on working in the school and getting the logistics done.

719
02:09:36,809 --> 02:09:39,350
[SPEAKER_22]: So we do most of the disruptive work over the summers.

720
02:09:39,790 --> 02:09:40,630
[SPEAKER_21]: Do you have a crystal ball?

721
02:09:40,890 --> 02:09:41,350
[SPEAKER_21]: Excuse me?

722
02:09:41,410 --> 02:09:42,130
[SPEAKER_21]: No crystal ball.

723
02:09:43,391 --> 02:09:43,911
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you so much.

724
02:09:43,931 --> 02:09:44,531
[SPEAKER_21]: I appreciate it.

725
02:09:46,252 --> 02:09:46,632
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Graham?

726
02:09:49,022 --> 02:09:49,362
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

727
02:09:49,382 --> 02:09:51,244
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to say thank you.

728
02:09:51,405 --> 02:10:06,921
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been on many several of these calls over the last couple of months and I know the team is working really hard, and that there's a lot of unknown in this in the equation right even though we're like well down the path I know there's still so many variables that you're dealing with.

729
02:10:08,081 --> 02:10:18,966
[SPEAKER_05]: And most recently, we had a lot of conversation about like the timing of bringing these things forward, not only here, but to the council, because it is a significant bond in the end.

730
02:10:19,086 --> 02:10:32,993
[SPEAKER_05]: So how do we sort of balance the need to get moving, if we want to be able to do this work in the summer, which meant like we've got to do this now, with the like, still developing and coming into like focus

731
02:10:33,753 --> 02:10:36,154
[SPEAKER_05]: work that has to be done to really hone the whole budget.

732
02:10:36,274 --> 02:10:43,598
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think this is a great solution and I just wanted to say thank you because I know this has been a tremendous amount of work.

733
02:10:45,322 --> 02:10:48,103
[SPEAKER_05]: All of these things are on the capital plan, which we'll talk about in just a little while.

734
02:10:48,864 --> 02:10:58,228
[SPEAKER_05]: But the other thing we'll talk about in the capital plan is the desire that this committee has expressed before to commission or recommission buildings.

735
02:10:58,368 --> 02:11:02,569
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've had some preliminary conversation with that, which I'll share later.

736
02:11:03,090 --> 02:11:08,292
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the reason we got here is because we didn't do the things we should have been doing all along the way.

737
02:11:08,392 --> 02:11:08,992
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it was like,

738
02:11:09,944 --> 02:11:30,440
[SPEAKER_05]: okay everything failed and now the Andrews is sweltering hot and the McGlynn is right behind it and we have three other buildings that were built at exactly the same time like they're going to come right around the bend pretty quickly and they have all the same challenges that that these two complexes have so the other thing that we'll talk about when we talk about the capital plan is

739
02:11:31,201 --> 02:11:34,842
[SPEAKER_05]: How do we do better right now for a future us?

740
02:11:35,622 --> 02:11:40,643
[SPEAKER_05]: So that future us doesn't have to be grappling with the same kinds of issues.

741
02:11:40,723 --> 02:11:42,944
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's more to come.

742
02:11:43,924 --> 02:11:46,505
[SPEAKER_05]: But this team has been very helpful in all of that.

743
02:11:47,445 --> 02:11:48,305
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you for that.

744
02:11:48,905 --> 02:11:57,267
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I would like to make a motion to approve proceeding with the project and to recommend to the council that they

745
02:11:59,668 --> 02:12:08,093
[SPEAKER_05]: take the steps that they need to take to issue this initial bond so that the team can remain on track and we can have working air.

746
02:12:09,734 --> 02:12:10,014
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

747
02:12:10,815 --> 02:12:28,506
[SPEAKER_05]: So motion to approve the project at this stage and recommend that the council proceed with the process to secure the initial bond so that there's no further, there's no delay in the project.

748
02:12:33,618 --> 02:12:48,243
[SPEAKER_14]: To be clear, I am in favor of approving it, but I think it's useful to have the context of what was discussed in the capital planning meetings because we were supposed to have had that last week and have that context for the council.

749
02:12:48,283 --> 02:12:51,544
[SPEAKER_14]: But I'm on that subcommittee, so I know what's coming.

750
02:12:52,124 --> 02:12:54,785
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess maybe I'd defer to the people who

751
02:12:55,669 --> 02:12:56,750
[SPEAKER_05]: As long as we can do it tonight.

752
02:12:56,870 --> 02:13:01,715
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, I am in favor of doing it tonight, but I think it's useful to have the context of that plan.

753
02:13:02,836 --> 02:13:07,762
[SPEAKER_10]: Can we just all confirm that there's no more questions for our OPM, Director Hunt, or Brenda?

754
02:13:08,542 --> 02:13:09,563
[SPEAKER_10]: And not for me.

755
02:13:09,964 --> 02:13:10,544
[SPEAKER_10]: Go on home.

756
02:13:11,606 --> 02:13:14,969
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you need us to stay through your capital plan discussion is the question.

757
02:13:15,409 --> 02:13:15,490
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

758
02:13:19,580 --> 02:13:21,923
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, thank you to the whole team that's helped with this.

759
02:13:22,143 --> 02:13:24,446
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been a lot of hours and we really appreciate it.

760
02:13:24,466 --> 02:13:31,133
[SPEAKER_10]: We're excited to get some air conditioning back up and running at our one elementary and two middle schools.

761
02:13:31,433 --> 02:13:31,734
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

762
02:13:32,094 --> 02:13:36,359
[SPEAKER_10]: So motion for approval by Member Graham, seconded by, oh, you want a motion to table?

763
02:13:39,130 --> 02:13:42,851
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, there's a motion to table by Member Reinfeld, seconded by Member Branley.

764
02:13:44,651 --> 02:13:45,291
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

765
02:13:46,452 --> 02:13:47,112
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

766
02:13:47,332 --> 02:13:48,972
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, the motion is tabled.

767
02:13:49,672 --> 02:13:50,993
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for being here.

768
02:13:51,453 --> 02:13:53,033
[SPEAKER_10]: There's no presentations of the public.

769
02:13:54,474 --> 02:13:59,635
[SPEAKER_10]: We have continued business review and approval of the revised budget calendar.

770
02:13:59,655 --> 02:14:00,415
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll invite Ms.

771
02:14:03,891 --> 02:14:05,633
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion to take new business out of order.

772
02:14:05,793 --> 02:14:08,014
[SPEAKER_10]: No, nevermind, sorry.

773
02:14:08,255 --> 02:14:10,777
[SPEAKER_14]: Director McCue is ready, so I withdraw the motion.

774
02:14:10,797 --> 02:14:12,118
[SPEAKER_10]: I withdraw the motion, okay.

775
02:14:12,738 --> 02:14:17,923
[SPEAKER_10]: Review and approval of the revised budget calendar, Mr. Gerry McCue, budget analyst.

776
02:14:24,153 --> 02:14:24,493
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this on?

777
02:14:24,793 --> 02:14:26,254
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

778
02:14:26,394 --> 02:14:27,314
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening, everyone.

779
02:14:29,015 --> 02:14:40,880
[SPEAKER_00]: The last time I appeared before you, I had suggested some changes to the budget development procedures that were adopted by the school committee last year.

780
02:14:41,641 --> 02:14:53,326
[SPEAKER_00]: And my takeaway from that meeting was to go back and identify particular budget dates that would change in the already approved calendar.

781
02:14:54,794 --> 02:14:59,215
[SPEAKER_00]: in your packet, you have some of those proposed changes.

782
02:14:59,235 --> 02:15:21,702
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially, I think it would be beneficial to kind of add a month in the budget development timeline, as I described at the end of the proposed calendar, and I kept

783
02:15:24,331 --> 02:15:37,620
[SPEAKER_00]: The meetings that I identified to change consistent with already scheduled regular school committee meetings, which is how the original budget was developed.

784
02:15:37,660 --> 02:15:42,824
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, school committee can always schedule special meetings if needed.

785
02:15:44,485 --> 02:15:53,551
[SPEAKER_00]: It leaves four dates that coincide with regular school committee meetings for Committee of the Wholes, if we need to.

786
02:15:53,611 --> 02:15:57,374
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, those can be done as special meetings as well.

787
02:15:58,875 --> 02:16:03,098
[SPEAKER_00]: Last year, I think we had three Committee of the Whole meetings in the lead up to the budget.

788
02:16:04,780 --> 02:16:10,804
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're actively engaged with principals and directors right now.

789
02:16:11,764 --> 02:16:13,405
[SPEAKER_00]: in our budget development process.

790
02:16:13,845 --> 02:16:21,470
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll conclude those initial meetings next Thursday.

791
02:16:21,490 --> 02:16:27,533
[SPEAKER_00]: And then everybody will take a well-deserved break.

792
02:16:27,834 --> 02:16:35,218
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll get back in January and start to put budget, identify

793
02:16:38,603 --> 02:16:58,379
[SPEAKER_00]: or lockdown enrollment projections, class needs, have those discussions with the leadership team to see what we wanna move forward with in terms of recommendations, and try to get that all wrapped up by the end of February.

794
02:16:58,819 --> 02:17:05,764
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's just the mechanical tasks of putting the budgets together, the presentation,

795
02:17:07,329 --> 02:17:24,341
[SPEAKER_00]: the narrative in my experience, you know, the narrative turns out to be important because things that work out perfectly on spreadsheets, when you go to explain them, you identify gaps that you can circle back with people and kind of bring some clarity to those.

796
02:17:25,702 --> 02:17:26,943
[SPEAKER_10]: Great, thank you, Mr. McHugh.

797
02:17:27,243 --> 02:17:31,566
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there a motion for approval of the new proposed timeline?

798
02:17:32,727 --> 02:17:33,307
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Ruseau?

799
02:17:34,288 --> 02:17:35,449
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, I appreciate this.

800
02:17:39,932 --> 02:17:48,739
[SPEAKER_21]: This is probably going to be a rather unusual budget, because there's the additional funds, yet we have not identified exactly how they'll be spent.

801
02:17:49,260 --> 02:18:08,495
[SPEAKER_21]: Do you anticipate this being one of those budgets where we're going to kind of get a lot of the way through, and then you'll have to come back and be like, OK, now that we know this about negotiations with the unions and all this other stuff about how we're going to exactly spend the money from the override,

802
02:18:09,420 --> 02:18:30,147
[SPEAKER_21]: that you'll have to come back around with a amended budget or, I mean, it wouldn't be a supplemental appropriation because we will have, we'll know what the number is before that, but how we're gonna spend it seems like that might move in a way that's not normal, except for in these unusual circumstances.

803
02:18:32,618 --> 02:18:40,602
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, in addition, we are developing the supplemental budget as well to be ready for mid-January.

804
02:18:43,104 --> 02:18:43,484
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

805
02:18:43,524 --> 02:18:47,606
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we have the current budget.

806
02:18:48,967 --> 02:18:54,810
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be adding to that based on the vote in November.

807
02:18:55,731 --> 02:18:57,612
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we'll

808
02:18:58,226 --> 02:19:00,627
[SPEAKER_00]: be developing a budget around that number.

809
02:19:00,687 --> 02:19:10,891
[SPEAKER_00]: If it turns out, I believe the school committee is interested if we need actually more than what we think we have, we want to disclose that.

810
02:19:11,051 --> 02:19:15,513
[SPEAKER_00]: We want a chance to advocate for that with the city council.

811
02:19:18,214 --> 02:19:26,957
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't anticipate a need for a supplemental, but that's just another tool we have, you know, as we go along, if we have to

812
02:19:28,826 --> 02:19:29,626
[SPEAKER_00]: change things up.

813
02:19:29,706 --> 02:19:53,793
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course, as the budget procedure outlines, a process for coming back and kind of deciding how we want to reconcile the budget with what the city council provides or what the mayor provides in her recommendation to the city council.

814
02:19:54,582 --> 02:19:54,922
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

815
02:19:55,042 --> 02:20:08,788
[SPEAKER_21]: And so one other thing that I'm hoping we can do differently this year, and it's based on conversations from the school committee conference, it sounds like we're not alone, but it's definitely not best practice.

816
02:20:08,828 --> 02:20:15,270
[SPEAKER_21]: And from what I heard, it was things only really happening in very small districts, which we are not.

817
02:20:16,111 --> 02:20:24,214
[SPEAKER_21]: And that is we have traditionally voted one number, which essentially gives the authority for the administration to move all the money around

818
02:20:24,804 --> 02:20:27,306
[SPEAKER_21]: between line items as they see fit.

819
02:20:27,326 --> 02:20:28,367
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, as they need.

820
02:20:28,407 --> 02:20:31,689
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't mean to suggest that they're just willy nilly moving money around.

821
02:20:32,169 --> 02:20:39,795
[SPEAKER_21]: But in the best practice and in most districts of our size and certainly larger districts, we vote on each line item.

822
02:20:40,655 --> 02:20:45,358
[SPEAKER_21]: Not the little tiny detail, but the big sections.

823
02:20:45,899 --> 02:20:47,320
[SPEAKER_21]: We vote each section.

824
02:20:47,800 --> 02:20:51,663
[SPEAKER_21]: And there are probably always the same yeses for all of them.

825
02:20:52,142 --> 02:21:03,912
[SPEAKER_21]: But what that does is that retains for us our authority to say, if you decide you need to take $200,000 out of the elementary school budget and move it to the middle school, you don't just do that.

826
02:21:03,952 --> 02:21:05,072
[SPEAKER_21]: You've got to get our permission.

827
02:21:05,633 --> 02:21:11,318
[SPEAKER_21]: And this isn't necessarily a conversation that we can settle tonight, because it wasn't on the agenda.

828
02:21:11,938 --> 02:21:14,460
[SPEAKER_21]: It isn't in our budget policy.

829
02:21:14,500 --> 02:21:20,465
[SPEAKER_21]: But it's something I hope we can do here, because it was a bit of a surprise to me that that's

830
02:21:22,454 --> 02:21:35,103
[SPEAKER_21]: It explained to me why it is that other school committees that I've observed are always having these things on their agenda to transfer funds from one account to another, and that in my seven years, we have never once transferred a nickel.

831
02:21:36,324 --> 02:21:38,165
[SPEAKER_21]: And now I understand why, so.

832
02:21:38,466 --> 02:21:49,834
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, when I was in Chelsea, before Boston University took over the governance of the school department for 20 years,

833
02:21:51,874 --> 02:21:59,437
[SPEAKER_00]: The school committee was approving, on a line item basis, transfers.

834
02:21:59,917 --> 02:22:03,038
[SPEAKER_00]: BU was actually not interested in that.

835
02:22:03,098 --> 02:22:06,779
[SPEAKER_00]: They held the superintendent accountable for a balanced budget.

836
02:22:07,019 --> 02:22:09,280
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were just interested in the bottom line.

837
02:22:10,034 --> 02:22:25,043
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you go to Department of Local Services, Best Practices, the school committee, the approval of the budget and appropriating money and how to spend it.

838
02:22:25,343 --> 02:22:29,325
[SPEAKER_00]: Departments can't spend money unless it's appropriated by the school committee.

839
02:22:31,287 --> 02:22:35,651
[SPEAKER_00]: significant responsibility the school department, the school committee has.

840
02:22:37,893 --> 02:22:45,220
[SPEAKER_00]: What we developed, which is part of guidance you can get, is to establish cost centers.

841
02:22:46,081 --> 02:22:50,746
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did was every school was its own cost center.

842
02:22:51,863 --> 02:22:54,545
[SPEAKER_00]: Certain departments, central office was a cost center.

843
02:22:54,985 --> 02:22:58,288
[SPEAKER_00]: Curriculum instruction was a cost of facilities cost center.

844
02:22:58,348 --> 02:23:11,657
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're right, within those cost centers, there was freedom for the administration to move money around and there was a reporting mechanism to come back to the school committee when money was moved.

845
02:23:13,217 --> 02:23:24,041
[SPEAKER_00]: in your example, to take money from the high school and transfer it to the middle school, that would have to be something that would be approved, because it's crossing cost centers.

846
02:23:24,361 --> 02:23:27,862
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and when I first came to Medved, I

847
02:23:29,093 --> 02:23:41,982
[SPEAKER_00]: I quickly read through, there's in the policy section of the school committee section on the website, there is a budget policy there.

848
02:23:42,422 --> 02:23:51,449
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you read it, I didn't read it thoroughly, but it looks like it's kind of a cost center based policy.

849
02:23:53,010 --> 02:24:12,903
[SPEAKER_00]: application of approving transfers, but to the extent that we will, one thing we will do is that probably in February, we will do a deep dive into projecting what our year end spending is going to be and that often entails

850
02:24:14,275 --> 02:24:18,016
[SPEAKER_00]: a number of transfers, you're kind of reprojecting salary accounts.

851
02:24:21,057 --> 02:24:28,759
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, that might be, you know, something that will definitely be something that we'll put before the school committee to approve.

852
02:24:30,179 --> 02:24:30,580
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

853
02:24:31,600 --> 02:24:38,002
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's often, you know, if somebody goes over their line item by $1,000, and they have a

854
02:24:39,966 --> 02:24:56,181
[SPEAKER_00]: $35,000 line items, typical that when we feel confident that we have sufficient funds on a bottom line basis, that we just approve that, and then we'd follow up with this kind of cleaning it up with a future transfer.

855
02:24:56,201 --> 02:24:57,863
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

856
02:24:57,883 --> 02:24:58,584
[SPEAKER_21]: I appreciate it.

857
02:24:58,604 --> 02:24:59,885
[SPEAKER_21]: A lot of detail there, I know.

858
02:24:59,925 --> 02:25:04,129
[SPEAKER_21]: And I kind of dumped that on you, but it seemed like a good time to talk about it.

859
02:25:04,209 --> 02:25:04,489
Thank you.

860
02:25:04,669 --> 02:25:04,790
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.

861
02:25:09,197 --> 02:25:24,790
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, motion for approval of this timeline by member, by member Gramps, thank you, seconded by member Lopate.

862
02:25:25,010 --> 02:25:25,730
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

863
02:25:26,411 --> 02:25:27,151
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

864
02:25:27,472 --> 02:25:27,852
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

865
02:25:28,272 --> 02:25:28,853
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, thank you.

866
02:25:32,938 --> 02:25:44,446
[SPEAKER_10]: We have new business recommendation from the strategic and capital planning subcommittee, review and approval of the capital plan developed by the subcommittee through a series of meetings held on October 15th and November 19th, 2024.

867
02:25:44,926 --> 02:25:45,427
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Graham.

868
02:25:45,467 --> 02:25:45,687
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

869
02:26:00,547 --> 02:26:03,068
[SPEAKER_05]: I did provide you all a printout.

870
02:26:03,128 --> 02:26:04,169
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it's quite small.

871
02:26:04,269 --> 02:26:12,732
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of columns and things that are happening on this capital plan, but I did want to go through just in a little bit of detail.

872
02:26:12,752 --> 02:26:22,216
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've met, we met multiple times as a subcommittee and we really worked through all the things that were on the capital plan that we created.

873
02:26:22,856 --> 02:26:50,591
[SPEAKER_05]: sort of last year in like May and now we're moving into a different timeline where we have these things happening a little bit more proactively because to create a capital plan at the end of May means there's not really a whole lot of time either to figure out how to like absorb something into the budget or ask for funds from the city if there's something urgent and so it sort of perpetuates this like cycle of us doing things when

874
02:26:51,411 --> 02:26:51,991
[SPEAKER_05]: staff breaks.

875
02:26:52,712 --> 02:27:01,635
[SPEAKER_05]: And part of the goal of the budget policy and the capital planning policy that we put forward was to try to break that cycle.

876
02:27:02,815 --> 02:27:04,176
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're here.

877
02:27:04,196 --> 02:27:06,817
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we're actually a little bit ahead of schedule.

878
02:27:08,252 --> 02:27:13,215
[SPEAKER_05]: And what you have before you is our view at a point in time.

879
02:27:13,255 --> 02:27:15,676
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually changed since I printed it today.

880
02:27:15,776 --> 02:27:17,337
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what happens with these things.

881
02:27:17,357 --> 02:27:22,359
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll give you a couple of what I think are pertinent updates as we go.

882
02:27:22,459 --> 02:27:23,840
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you look at the top,

883
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:31,583
[SPEAKER_05]: The first section are all projects that are either in progress or funded to be started.

884
02:27:32,383 --> 02:27:38,385
[SPEAKER_05]: And for the most part, they are things that are well in motion, much of which we just talked about with HVAC.

885
02:27:38,445 --> 02:27:40,766
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's a couple of things that are worth noting.

886
02:27:40,826 --> 02:27:46,349
[SPEAKER_05]: So the fire pump control work at the McGlynn Elementary Middle School is actually complete.

887
02:27:46,429 --> 02:27:46,969
[SPEAKER_05]: So the work

888
02:27:47,569 --> 02:27:48,089
[SPEAKER_05]: is completed.

889
02:27:48,129 --> 02:27:48,690
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all done.

890
02:27:48,730 --> 02:27:49,350
[SPEAKER_05]: We're good to go.

891
02:27:49,370 --> 02:27:55,473
[SPEAKER_05]: But it felt exciting to put something in complete status from a project standpoint on the on the plan.

892
02:27:55,493 --> 02:27:56,553
[SPEAKER_05]: So we made note of that.

893
02:27:58,211 --> 02:28:05,876
[SPEAKER_05]: The LED light replacement, Dr. Cushing has been talking with us about LED light replacement for quite some time.

894
02:28:05,936 --> 02:28:07,677
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is the final leg of that.

895
02:28:08,558 --> 02:28:19,865
[SPEAKER_05]: The cost that you see that sort of spread out over the course of FY 25, 26, on and on and on, those are on bill payments.

896
02:28:20,106 --> 02:28:25,549
[SPEAKER_05]: So they sort of get absorbed into our electric costs in some capacity.

897
02:28:25,569 --> 02:28:27,050
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's no budget.

898
02:28:29,271 --> 02:28:30,792
[SPEAKER_05]: for that needs to be new.

899
02:28:30,872 --> 02:28:37,474
[SPEAKER_05]: It's already planned for in our budget and it's about $300,000 per building over the course of five years.

900
02:28:37,534 --> 02:28:38,195
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's why you see 60, 60, 60, 60, 60.

901
02:28:41,556 --> 02:28:44,737
[SPEAKER_05]: The solar roof and battery we talked about just a little while ago.

902
02:28:44,837 --> 02:28:48,578
[SPEAKER_05]: So the city's ARPA funds are paying for that project.

903
02:28:49,479 --> 02:28:52,580
[SPEAKER_05]: That solar roof no longer battery.

904
02:28:52,660 --> 02:28:54,220
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's a small update.

905
02:28:56,261 --> 02:29:02,724
[SPEAKER_05]: that solar roof project has been going on since before I was on the school committee or ever considered being on the school committee.

906
02:29:02,764 --> 02:29:11,029
[SPEAKER_05]: So, it's a long time coming and it has, you know, we couldn't put solar on the roof until we had a roof that was worth putting solar on top and all of the steps.

907
02:29:11,069 --> 02:29:17,232
[SPEAKER_05]: So, that's been a long time coming but certainly, we'll look forward to the advantages of that soon.

908
02:29:18,692 --> 02:29:23,754
[SPEAKER_05]: The next several lines are sort of wrapped up in the HVAC replacement at Andrews and at McGlynn.

909
02:29:24,634 --> 02:29:29,796
[SPEAKER_05]: The roof rebuild slash solar at McGlynn is listed here.

910
02:29:29,816 --> 02:29:40,200
[SPEAKER_05]: The networked closet mini splits, so those are air conditioning units that are required to keep all of our IT infrastructure running and not melting.

911
02:29:41,361 --> 02:29:45,745
[SPEAKER_05]: That is part and parcel of this bigger project that we've been talking about.

912
02:29:46,245 --> 02:29:50,730
[SPEAKER_05]: So all of those pieces are what we just discussed.

913
02:29:50,750 --> 02:30:01,520
[SPEAKER_05]: And that would be the pieces that are subject to the approval of the project at this stage, as well as the recommendation to the council so that they can proceed with the bond.

914
02:30:02,641 --> 02:30:05,242
[SPEAKER_05]: There are many steps, as I understand it, on the council side.

915
02:30:05,362 --> 02:30:07,583
[SPEAKER_05]: So we definitely want to make sure we get to that tonight.

916
02:30:07,684 --> 02:30:18,130
[SPEAKER_05]: But the other things that are on this list, the next item on the list is the failed flashing behind the brick facade.

917
02:30:20,191 --> 02:30:40,865
[SPEAKER_05]: this is in progress in that we have some design work completed but it does need funding and it's about $100,000 and this is what causes it to rain inside an interior kindergarten classroom when the wind and the rain goes sideways against the building in just the right way.

918
02:30:40,945 --> 02:30:46,889
[SPEAKER_05]: So, that is something that we've been talking about but if you look in the project status and recommendation column,

919
02:30:48,550 --> 02:30:52,774
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a recommendation that we proceed with that in FY25.

920
02:30:53,294 --> 02:31:04,104
[SPEAKER_05]: And anything that says recommend proceeding in FY25, that's a cue if we approve this as it's written to ask that these things be considered in the supplemental budget that'll come before us.

921
02:31:05,404 --> 02:31:17,052
[SPEAKER_05]: in January, and if they cannot be included in the supplemental budget, those would be things we would probably need to have another conversation about in terms of asking and requesting money from the city to be able to prioritize those things.

922
02:31:17,132 --> 02:31:28,520
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have replaced things in that poor kindergarten classroom like three times now because of flooding, and that it's

923
02:31:30,041 --> 02:31:32,685
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a very sort of wacky problem.

924
02:31:32,806 --> 02:31:38,895
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not the roof exactly, but it's the brick and some of what's happening behind the brick.

925
02:31:40,037 --> 02:31:44,123
[SPEAKER_05]: So that is on the list of like in progress because there is some amount of design work done.

926
02:31:45,623 --> 02:31:47,024
[SPEAKER_05]: bike rack modernization.

927
02:31:47,264 --> 02:31:50,445
[SPEAKER_05]: Um this was actually funded by the community preservation committee.

928
02:31:50,525 --> 02:31:58,207
[SPEAKER_05]: So, it is in progress and you'll see the grant eligibility listed listing that there is a funding by the CPC.

929
02:31:59,128 --> 02:32:11,692
[SPEAKER_05]: Um the MHS classroom phone access is a a project that's ongoing with the district's sort of conversion over to a new phone system and there's no capital

930
02:32:15,133 --> 02:32:28,940
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the last thing in the in progress section is the hot water heater replacement at the Brooks that did receive money from the stabilization fund in October and the work was beginning today actually and will be done over the break.

931
02:32:29,040 --> 02:32:34,663
[SPEAKER_05]: So the hot water situation at the Brooks will be resolved when everyone is back from the holiday.

932
02:32:35,684 --> 02:32:37,985
[SPEAKER_05]: Any questions so far?

933
02:32:41,149 --> 02:32:41,769
[SPEAKER_10]: No, you're doing great.

934
02:32:41,809 --> 02:32:42,169
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

935
02:32:43,109 --> 02:32:44,290
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it's just a lot to take in.

936
02:32:44,370 --> 02:32:49,291
[SPEAKER_05]: So the next section are the either future or unfunded projects.

937
02:32:49,411 --> 02:32:52,672
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm going to take them in a couple of categories as well.

938
02:32:53,792 --> 02:33:01,194
[SPEAKER_05]: The first one on the list is the historic assessment to address the front stairwell and ADA accessibility improvements for the Curtis Tufts.

939
02:33:02,174 --> 02:33:03,976
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is just again an assessment.

940
02:33:05,197 --> 02:33:12,604
[SPEAKER_05]: There is an application pending with the CPC so that is there's no action for us to take but just more of a note for all of us that that's happening.

941
02:33:14,225 --> 02:33:19,610
[SPEAKER_05]: The bike rack modernization for the outside schools so Brooks, Missittuck, and Roberts.

942
02:33:22,172 --> 02:33:32,397
[SPEAKER_05]: the subcommittee is recommending that the district apply for CPC funding to match the funding that was already approved for McGlynn and Andrews.

943
02:33:33,658 --> 02:33:34,518
[SPEAKER_05]: So that is that one.

944
02:33:34,558 --> 02:33:39,601
[SPEAKER_05]: So those are our two CPC sort of near term projects that are outlined.

945
02:33:41,962 --> 02:33:49,046
[SPEAKER_05]: The next handful are things that if you look in the status column, it says recommend proceeding in FY25.

946
02:33:50,914 --> 02:33:52,683
[SPEAKER_05]: So that means these are the things that.

947
02:33:53,288 --> 02:33:56,289
[SPEAKER_05]: We feel like our urgent have been lingering.

948
02:33:56,589 --> 02:34:03,673
[SPEAKER_05]: We have not addressed in some time or are really critical in terms of advancing our objective to be more proactive about maintenance.

949
02:34:04,913 --> 02:34:06,334
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll just take them one at a time.

950
02:34:06,394 --> 02:34:10,236
[SPEAKER_05]: The HVAC and roof mini recommissioning assessment.

951
02:34:10,276 --> 02:34:21,781
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are my very unscientific words, but essentially we have three other buildings that have systems just as old as the McGlynn and Andrews.

952
02:34:22,721 --> 02:34:42,937
[SPEAKER_05]: And if we can facilitate like a mini reconditioning project, it could help inform us whether we should consider applying in this round of accelerated repair through MSBA for a possible grant.

953
02:34:43,898 --> 02:34:50,303
[SPEAKER_05]: Accelerated repair just opened today, and it will stay open until it usually stays open till sometime in April.

954
02:34:51,684 --> 02:35:07,731
[SPEAKER_05]: accelerated repairs for things like roofs and boilers, and the MSBA will match the, you know, typically there's again there's a reimbursement rate that's always sort of subject to a question but provide partial funding grant funding to replace those systems.

955
02:35:09,051 --> 02:35:17,554
[SPEAKER_05]: What I did learn about accelerated repair this round is that they're opening accelerated repair this round.

956
02:35:18,255 --> 02:35:25,637
[SPEAKER_05]: And those districts who are awarded will get notification probably about this time next year that they were successful or not.

957
02:35:26,197 --> 02:35:30,319
[SPEAKER_05]: But then they're moving to an every other year accelerated repair schedule.

958
02:35:30,379 --> 02:35:32,219
[SPEAKER_05]: So that means if we do not apply in 2025,

959
02:35:33,840 --> 02:35:35,281
[SPEAKER_05]: we cannot apply until 2027.

960
02:35:35,741 --> 02:35:49,666
[SPEAKER_05]: So my hope is that we can find a way to fund those mini assessments to inform the question of can we wait to apply until 2027 or do we really need to sort of move quickly and

961
02:35:50,886 --> 02:35:53,647
[SPEAKER_05]: be in a position to apply in 2025 for matching grants.

962
02:35:53,787 --> 02:36:03,671
[SPEAKER_05]: I did confirm that districts can have an accelerated repair project going on at the same time as what they call a core project, which is what Medford High School is.

963
02:36:04,552 --> 02:36:09,934
[SPEAKER_05]: So I do think, and it's about the TBD, that number came in since I printed this at like four o'clock.

964
02:36:10,654 --> 02:36:12,675
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's about $25,000 per school.

965
02:36:12,695 --> 02:36:13,555
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'd be talking about $75,000.

966
02:36:13,595 --> 02:36:18,097
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Ruseau, do you have a question?

967
02:36:20,541 --> 02:36:44,946
[SPEAKER_21]: The accelerated repair opens on January 13th, but the most important day for us is that it closes on March 21st, which is a tight timeline to actually figure out where we're gonna get the money, get it actually spent, get that assessment done so that we can then write a, we could probably write one ahead of time and populate it, but it's a tight timeline.

968
02:36:45,066 --> 02:36:48,407
[SPEAKER_21]: But I agree that we either hurry it up

969
02:36:49,173 --> 02:36:59,645
[SPEAKER_21]: get it in by March 21st, or we risk being forced to just pay for the whole thing out of our pocket if we can't wait till, I mean, if 2027 is the next time we can apply.

970
02:36:59,665 --> 02:37:01,987
[SPEAKER_05]: It's 2028 when the work gets done.

971
02:37:02,628 --> 02:37:03,209
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

972
02:37:04,090 --> 02:37:05,732
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's a lot of years to

973
02:37:06,570 --> 02:37:20,017
[SPEAKER_05]: And the assessment may tell us that that's okay, right like we that's what we don't that's all of the unknown that I was, I'm hoping that we can address so the, the owners project manager who was just here.

974
02:37:20,797 --> 02:37:22,218
[SPEAKER_05]: We, I have been sort of.

975
02:37:23,317 --> 02:37:25,720
[SPEAKER_05]: telling them that this may come their way.

976
02:37:25,880 --> 02:37:30,384
[SPEAKER_05]: It is part of the scope of what they are signed up to do with us.

977
02:37:30,424 --> 02:37:35,570
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think we do have a funding question that we need to answer hopefully in January when we talk about the supplemental budget.

978
02:37:36,791 --> 02:37:43,838
[SPEAKER_05]: But they are aware that this could be coming and that it would be a pretty, you know, there would be a need for something quick.

979
02:37:45,420 --> 02:37:53,946
[SPEAKER_05]: quick action to be taken in order to be able to write the statement of interest, get it approved and all that stuff.

980
02:37:53,986 --> 02:38:03,974
[SPEAKER_05]: So there are a lot of steps and it's lightning fast, but if we choose not to move lightning fast right now, we're two years out before we can entertain that again.

981
02:38:04,094 --> 02:38:08,637
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's why that one is listed as recommend proceeding in FY25.

982
02:38:11,447 --> 02:38:21,295
[SPEAKER_05]: The network closet mini splits, which is the next item that TBD has also come in in the last three, four hours, 118,000 for those three outside schools.

983
02:38:22,276 --> 02:38:35,046
[SPEAKER_05]: The recommendation to do that right now is because we cannot afford to melt all of our technical infrastructure in those buildings, which is a real risk given where we are.

984
02:38:35,066 --> 02:38:38,449
[SPEAKER_05]: 118 for the three, yeah.

985
02:38:39,790 --> 02:38:40,150
[SPEAKER_21]: If I may.

986
02:38:40,959 --> 02:38:42,520
[SPEAKER_21]: Member Ruseau?

987
02:38:43,221 --> 02:38:47,243
[SPEAKER_21]: The replacement of the equipment that's in those closets is not cheap either.

988
02:38:47,464 --> 02:38:49,965
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not a personal laptop.

989
02:38:49,985 --> 02:38:50,666
[SPEAKER_05]: It's more than $118,000.

990
02:38:50,786 --> 02:38:52,647
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not personal laptop costs.

991
02:38:52,767 --> 02:38:54,328
[SPEAKER_21]: It's very expensive stuff.

992
02:38:55,189 --> 02:38:56,370
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

993
02:38:56,690 --> 02:39:00,293
[SPEAKER_05]: The next thing on the list is the freight elevator motor.

994
02:39:00,893 --> 02:39:04,896
[SPEAKER_05]: So the freight elevator is not working right now, and the motoring control needs to be replaced.

995
02:39:05,456 --> 02:39:06,197
[SPEAKER_05]: at Medford High.

996
02:39:06,817 --> 02:39:11,921
[SPEAKER_05]: So we are recommending proceeding with that because I know it's a Medford High project.

997
02:39:12,302 --> 02:39:25,412
[SPEAKER_05]: It is only $25,000, but more importantly, I don't believe the building can be without a working freight elevator for the next four to six years while we wait for a bigger solution at Medford High.

998
02:39:25,492 --> 02:39:29,095
[SPEAKER_05]: So that is sort of the place that we're at with Medford High.

999
02:39:29,135 --> 02:39:32,217
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like we'll continue to have these conversations about

1000
02:39:33,078 --> 02:39:33,659
[SPEAKER_05]: Can it wait?

1001
02:39:33,719 --> 02:39:34,559
[SPEAKER_05]: Can it not wait?

1002
02:39:34,860 --> 02:39:40,884
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's, again, why I try not to run things to end of life quite this way.

1003
02:39:40,964 --> 02:39:43,006
[SPEAKER_05]: But we're just going to have to navigate that as it goes.

1004
02:39:43,026 --> 02:39:49,531
[SPEAKER_14]: How does that coincide with the lifetime?

1005
02:39:49,571 --> 02:39:54,255
[SPEAKER_14]: And it was a reasonable proportion of the freight motor lifetime.

1006
02:39:54,295 --> 02:39:58,258
[SPEAKER_14]: It wasn't like, oh, we're getting 1% of its valuable lifetime by doing it.

1007
02:39:58,278 --> 02:39:59,199
[SPEAKER_14]: It did line up.

1008
02:39:59,379 --> 02:40:01,040
[SPEAKER_05]: Do not last centuries, yeah.

1009
02:40:02,524 --> 02:40:06,428
[SPEAKER_05]: The next thing on the list is drainage at the Brooks Fields, which is $22,000.

1010
02:40:06,828 --> 02:40:14,817
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some curbing that needs to be addressed and an expansion of the French drain.

1011
02:40:15,378 --> 02:40:18,060
[SPEAKER_05]: So, when the turf field was put in.

1012
02:40:19,602 --> 02:40:21,283
[SPEAKER_05]: I was on the PTO there at the time.

1013
02:40:22,164 --> 02:40:26,867
[SPEAKER_05]: And we were promised that the drainage would be addressed.

1014
02:40:27,547 --> 02:40:40,016
[SPEAKER_05]: And because now that it has not been addressed, the runoff from the hill in the front of the school runs off onto the new turf and is going to cause maintenance issues there at some point in time.

1015
02:40:40,096 --> 02:40:44,198
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a little bit unclear to me why that was not done.

1016
02:40:44,299 --> 02:40:46,700
[SPEAKER_05]: But we know now that it's $22,500, roughly give or take.

1017
02:40:49,862 --> 02:41:01,548
[SPEAKER_05]: I think at one time, there was an idea that maybe the DPW could get to it, but this is a quote from, I think, I believe the same company that did the turf installation.

1018
02:41:01,608 --> 02:41:04,530
[SPEAKER_05]: So that is on the recommend proceeding in FY25.

1019
02:41:06,531 --> 02:41:12,934
[SPEAKER_05]: District-wide keyless locks and key fobs is also on the recommend proceeding in FY25, and

1020
02:41:16,897 --> 02:41:19,258
[SPEAKER_05]: to move forward with that project.

1021
02:41:19,318 --> 02:41:19,998
[SPEAKER_05]: It's about $260,000.

1022
02:41:20,738 --> 02:41:39,926
[SPEAKER_05]: And what that would allow is keyless locks and employee FOB access for three to five doors at most schools, cameras and intercoms that are at select entry points to coincide, including three at the Brooks, three at the Roberts, three at the Missituk, two at the Andrews, two at the McGlynn Elementary and Middle, and three at MHS.

1023
02:41:41,146 --> 02:41:48,069
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that so I know we've gone through this whole process of changing sort of the keying of buildings.

1024
02:41:48,609 --> 02:41:57,832
[SPEAKER_05]: This move for $260,000 would move to a completely electronic key fob system and provide, I think,

1025
02:41:59,702 --> 02:42:09,230
[SPEAKER_05]: more controlled access, less risk of losing a key, and sort of more modern approach to that kind of issuance.

1026
02:42:11,371 --> 02:42:11,912
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll stop there.

1027
02:42:11,952 --> 02:42:14,794
[SPEAKER_05]: Any questions about the things we're recommending proceeding for FY25?

1028
02:42:18,228 --> 02:42:21,270
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, the next one is still a TBD.

1029
02:42:22,410 --> 02:42:24,292
[SPEAKER_05]: It's recommend proceeding and FY 26.

1030
02:42:25,472 --> 02:42:37,819
[SPEAKER_05]: The cost is still TBD, but all of the door sweeps and dumpsters need to be addressed so that we can get a better handle on our like pest control situation.

1031
02:42:37,839 --> 02:42:44,083
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you've ever walked by one of the dumpsters, they smell horrendously bad if it's not like sub zero out.

1032
02:42:45,484 --> 02:42:49,890
[SPEAKER_05]: So there is some work to be done there to figure out exactly how to do it.

1033
02:42:49,990 --> 02:43:02,425
[SPEAKER_05]: And actually, I was in a conversation with Director Hunt about whether there's a better alternative to how we have our dumpsters, like we own them now, which means we own all of the stink in them too.

1034
02:43:03,486 --> 02:43:09,527
[SPEAKER_05]: And in modern times, people lease these things for a reason from a maintenance perspective.

1035
02:43:09,607 --> 02:43:15,569
[SPEAKER_05]: So she was going to look into the new contract with lease management and whether there was something to change there.

1036
02:43:15,609 --> 02:43:26,371
[SPEAKER_05]: So not thinking that'll get done this year, but it does need to be done soon in order to prevent problems in the future.

1037
02:43:28,131 --> 02:43:30,432
[SPEAKER_05]: The front plaza settling remediation,

1038
02:43:33,823 --> 02:43:36,225
[SPEAKER_05]: an ADA compliance at McGlynn and Andrews.

1039
02:43:38,526 --> 02:43:44,750
[SPEAKER_05]: As I understand it, there's a potential grant that could at least partially pay for this work.

1040
02:43:47,052 --> 02:43:54,877
[SPEAKER_05]: We in 2022 attempted to submit and the submission was unsuccessful.

1041
02:43:57,019 --> 02:43:57,559
[SPEAKER_05]: The city's

1042
02:43:59,272 --> 02:44:02,795
[SPEAKER_05]: DEI director had a similar experience last year and

1043
02:44:06,292 --> 02:44:15,618
[SPEAKER_05]: What we are recommending is that we work with our state delegation to figure out why this is so complicated.

1044
02:44:15,838 --> 02:44:22,743
[SPEAKER_05]: But it sounds like all the brightest minds are saying this is a really complicated submission to get through.

1045
02:44:22,903 --> 02:44:25,305
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a huge challenge.

1046
02:44:25,345 --> 02:44:30,628
[SPEAKER_05]: So our recommendation is that we successfully submit this grant request this year.

1047
02:44:30,648 --> 02:44:35,552
[SPEAKER_05]: And otherwise, we will have to do this work

1048
02:44:37,273 --> 02:44:49,447
[SPEAKER_05]: As Dr. Cushing was stating, A, because we should, but B, because the cost of the project is so significant that we will have to do that in order to proceed with the HVAC project.

1049
02:44:52,270 --> 02:45:06,215
[SPEAKER_05]: I will reach out to our state delegation and see if there isn't something they can do to help with the submission process so that we have a good or a better sense of timing and how to make a successful submission than we did in the past.

1050
02:45:08,799 --> 02:45:11,480
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that's at McGlynn and Andrews.

1051
02:45:12,020 --> 02:45:13,981
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's like a twofold line.

1052
02:45:14,001 --> 02:45:16,962
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's $46,000 for the design, and then probably $300,000 to $500,000 to actually remediate that.

1053
02:45:16,982 --> 02:45:18,343
[SPEAKER_05]: Questions about any of that?

1054
02:45:28,345 --> 02:45:36,773
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, district wide security updates is the next on the list that is listed at 1.5 and FY 26.

1055
02:45:37,234 --> 02:45:40,537
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is cameras, vape sensors, etc.

1056
02:45:41,598 --> 02:45:43,780
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no action for us to take at this time.

1057
02:45:43,820 --> 02:45:49,466
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's something to look at in the FY 26 budgeting process and to see if there's anything that we can do there.

1058
02:45:49,486 --> 02:45:51,248
[SPEAKER_05]: And then if you flip over,

1059
02:45:52,230 --> 02:45:52,911
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll take it home.

1060
02:45:54,332 --> 02:45:56,333
[SPEAKER_05]: There's three playground renovations on this list.

1061
02:45:56,373 --> 02:46:02,058
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think we all are just absolutely in love with the work that was done at the McGlynn.

1062
02:46:02,718 --> 02:46:03,959
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a beautiful playground.

1063
02:46:04,480 --> 02:46:07,662
[SPEAKER_05]: It's accessible in a way that none of our other playgrounds are.

1064
02:46:08,142 --> 02:46:13,206
[SPEAKER_05]: All of our buildings house students who need more accessible play spaces.

1065
02:46:13,447 --> 02:46:16,629
[SPEAKER_05]: And all of those playgrounds are at end of life in one way, shape, or form.

1066
02:46:18,590 --> 02:46:25,416
[SPEAKER_05]: In all three of those instances, certainly we can put in an open space application with CPC.

1067
02:46:26,717 --> 02:46:34,803
[SPEAKER_05]: As a committee, what we did sort of get to is that our priority playground would be the Roberts of the three.

1068
02:46:37,532 --> 02:46:54,775
[SPEAKER_05]: with a caveat that we need to address the space issues at the Roberts in a bigger picture kind of way as a priority if we're going to make way to do an application with the CPC for a playground.

1069
02:46:54,815 --> 02:47:00,496
[SPEAKER_05]: So the playground redesign should not be undertaken without addressing first the broader space issues in that building.

1070
02:47:00,577 --> 02:47:02,717
[SPEAKER_05]: So we heard from the teachers earlier this year

1071
02:47:03,337 --> 02:47:05,058
[SPEAKER_05]: that the building is busting at the seams.

1072
02:47:06,279 --> 02:47:11,863
[SPEAKER_05]: We know that that is a problem and everyone's watching kindergarten enrollment very carefully.

1073
02:47:12,483 --> 02:47:22,650
[SPEAKER_05]: But even if those things sort of weren't true, the space, the footprint of that building is incredibly small and confined.

1074
02:47:22,790 --> 02:47:27,613
[SPEAKER_05]: So we didn't come up with any like magical solutions there in terms of what to do.

1075
02:47:27,974 --> 02:47:32,377
[SPEAKER_05]: We did have a good discussion about maybe creative alternatives, but

1076
02:47:33,277 --> 02:47:37,199
[SPEAKER_05]: The space as it exists right now is just not sufficient.

1077
02:47:38,220 --> 02:47:40,141
[SPEAKER_05]: The teachers have to park each other in.

1078
02:47:40,201 --> 02:47:44,503
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a huge no-no from a fire safety perspective, I would imagine.

1079
02:47:45,463 --> 02:47:49,385
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's any number of reasons why there's just simply not enough space there.

1080
02:47:50,646 --> 02:48:06,335
[SPEAKER_05]: at some point as we go forward and before we ask to invest the city's money in the playground there, there's some other sort of bigger picture things that we have to sort of grapple with and tackle with that building in particular.

1081
02:48:07,336 --> 02:48:19,943
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's on the list as is the playground at Missittuck and Brooks so that at some point in time, we can talk about like when is the right time for those things to come forward.

1082
02:48:22,698 --> 02:48:25,160
[SPEAKER_05]: parking lot paving at the McGlynn and Andrews.

1083
02:48:26,501 --> 02:48:33,567
[SPEAKER_05]: We are saying it's not committed at this time, but to give you a sense of what that will cost, it's about $1.3 million.

1084
02:48:35,109 --> 02:48:38,512
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the rest of these things, again, are not committed at this time.

1085
02:48:38,532 --> 02:48:41,674
[SPEAKER_05]: And the sort of

1086
02:48:42,935 --> 02:49:05,911
[SPEAKER_05]: both the cost and the urgency of some of these things are things that will come into focus if we're able to do this like mini commissioning which would be the district wide electrification enablement assessment that we talked about as well as the roof a roof rebuilder replacement at Brooks, Mistletoe and Roberts as well as the HVAC maintenance or replacement at Brooks, Mistletoe, Mistletoe and Roberts.

1087
02:49:06,491 --> 02:49:06,671
[SPEAKER_05]: So,

1088
02:49:07,572 --> 02:49:13,298
[SPEAKER_05]: Those numbers may move around dramatically if we find that one is in really good shape and one is not.

1089
02:49:14,359 --> 02:49:18,082
[SPEAKER_05]: But just to say, we know that they're all the same age.

1090
02:49:18,783 --> 02:49:19,884
[SPEAKER_05]: They're approaching end of life.

1091
02:49:21,546 --> 02:49:24,869
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're on the radar from a planning perspective for us and for the city.

1092
02:49:27,372 --> 02:49:30,033
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, that's everything on the capital plan.

1093
02:49:30,073 --> 02:49:30,773
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other questions?

1094
02:49:31,874 --> 02:49:32,554
[SPEAKER_10]: No, this is great.

1095
02:49:32,994 --> 02:49:36,736
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much to the subcommittee for doing this work.

1096
02:49:36,776 --> 02:49:38,036
[SPEAKER_10]: I know it took several meetings.

1097
02:49:38,076 --> 02:49:41,658
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's fabulous that we have a good capital plan.

1098
02:49:41,758 --> 02:49:48,301
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know capital plans are ever changing, but hopefully grants become available.

1099
02:49:48,721 --> 02:49:51,882
[SPEAKER_10]: We have the CPC and additional funding sources.

1100
02:49:51,942 --> 02:49:55,844
[SPEAKER_10]: So I know this will be ever changing, but it's a great start.

1101
02:49:56,044 --> 02:49:56,324
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1102
02:49:57,781 --> 02:50:00,262
[SPEAKER_05]: So I do think we need to do two things.

1103
02:50:00,342 --> 02:50:16,887
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to approve this, which will, I think the recommendation to approve should include that we'll pass this to Mr. McHugh so it can be contemplated in the supplemental budget so that we have some clarity once he comes before us in January.

1104
02:50:18,107 --> 02:50:24,069
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we also have to take off the table the approval of the HVAC project now that we're done with this.

1105
02:50:25,199 --> 02:50:27,140
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I didn't forget.

1106
02:50:27,801 --> 02:50:41,130
[SPEAKER_10]: So a motion for approval to send this over to the central administration, including Mr. McHugh with regards to the supplemental budget by member Graham, seconded by member Rousseau.

1107
02:50:41,190 --> 02:50:41,950
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

1108
02:50:41,970 --> 02:50:42,851

1109
02:50:43,071 --> 02:50:43,832
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

[SPEAKER_10]: Motion passes.

1111

[SPEAKER_10]: And then we're going to revert to
