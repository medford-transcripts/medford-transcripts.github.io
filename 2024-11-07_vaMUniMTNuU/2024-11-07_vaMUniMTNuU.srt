00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:28,354
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, everyone, and welcome to your show, Medford Happenings.

2
00:00:28,634 --> 00:00:34,780
[SPEAKER_08]: I am John Petrella, and this is a show for and about the city of Medford.

3
00:00:35,921 --> 00:00:45,029
[SPEAKER_08]: The purpose of this program is to give Medford citizens facts and information to help you make informed decisions.

4
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:47,972
[SPEAKER_08]: Today, we have a special guest.

5
00:00:49,377 --> 00:00:55,419
[SPEAKER_08]: Barbara Kerr, director of the Charlotte and William Bloomberg Method Public Library.

6
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:01,842
[SPEAKER_08]: But before we begin our conversation with Barbara, I want to share two short clips.

7
00:01:02,742 --> 00:01:09,745
[SPEAKER_08]: The first is an animation about the new library, and the second is folks speaking about it.

8
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:12,226
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's take a look at those videos.

9
00:03:39,327 --> 00:03:39,707
Thank you.

10
00:04:07,822 --> 00:04:12,404
[SPEAKER_03]: City of Medford is a city with a rich history and an exciting future.

11
00:04:12,744 --> 00:04:13,944
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a city on the move.

12
00:04:14,144 --> 00:04:15,485
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a great place to live.

13
00:04:15,565 --> 00:04:17,566
[SPEAKER_03]: I've grown up here and been here my whole life.

14
00:04:18,006 --> 00:04:20,327
[SPEAKER_03]: And very soon, we're going to have a brand new library.

15
00:04:20,347 --> 00:04:22,988
[SPEAKER_00]: The library plays so many roles in the city of Medford.

16
00:04:23,268 --> 00:04:25,329
[SPEAKER_00]: And this will be an integral part of our community.

17
00:04:25,969 --> 00:04:29,430
[SPEAKER_01]: We're a family of four kids, and we go to the library every day.

18
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:32,872
[SPEAKER_01]: To say hi to the librarians and to do story time or graphs.

19
00:04:33,432 --> 00:04:34,392
[SPEAKER_01]: And to take out books.

20
00:04:34,712 --> 00:04:35,873
[SPEAKER_01]: And to take out books.

21
00:04:36,858 --> 00:04:43,120
[SPEAKER_03]: The library was old, and it was built in a time when architecture was not particularly inspired or beautiful.

22
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,261
[SPEAKER_04]: There were very few electrical outlets.

23
00:04:45,361 --> 00:04:50,382
[SPEAKER_04]: So when computers came in, trying to find places to put them was a very complicated business.

24
00:04:50,822 --> 00:04:54,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Anytime there was standing water on the roof, it rained inside the building.

25
00:04:54,263 --> 00:04:56,464
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't actually leaking onto the books.

26
00:04:56,484 --> 00:04:57,684
[SPEAKER_04]: They had to put out buckets.

27
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:06,447
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was in conversations with the Massachusetts Board of Library Commissioners, where they sort of said, you guys really need a new library.

28
00:05:06,868 --> 00:05:15,558
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went to the city and to the state to get public funding committed and we also committed to secure significant support from the private sector.

29
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:27,332
[SPEAKER_01]: And today we are so excited that Michael Bloomberg is gifting the city of Medford three million dollars for the completion of its new library.

30
00:05:28,422 --> 00:05:35,426
[SPEAKER_06]: Growing up, the Medford Public Library was one of the most important places in town, and it played a big role in my family.

31
00:05:35,926 --> 00:05:41,829
[SPEAKER_06]: This gift is a way to say thanks, and to help it keep bringing the gift of reading and learning to more families.

32
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:44,170
[SPEAKER_06]: My father treasured books.

33
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:53,515
[SPEAKER_06]: My mother joined one of the library's first reading groups, and she continued going to lectures and readings there for the rest of her life, and she lived to 102.

34
00:05:54,095 --> 00:05:56,316
[SPEAKER_02]: Reading and learning was important to our parents.

35
00:05:56,696 --> 00:05:58,017
[SPEAKER_02]: They wanted us to be readers.

36
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:00,333
[SPEAKER_02]: They wanted us to have that experience.

37
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:03,439
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the library was central to our lives.

38
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,863
[SPEAKER_06]: My sister and I borrowed a lot of books.

39
00:06:06,484 --> 00:06:08,648
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes we even returned them on time.

40
00:06:11,706 --> 00:06:14,308
[SPEAKER_03]: The new library is rising.

41
00:06:14,928 --> 00:06:16,790
[SPEAKER_03]: All of the foundation work has been done.

42
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:19,672
[SPEAKER_03]: All of the steel frame is erected.

43
00:06:19,872 --> 00:06:21,193
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be full of light.

44
00:06:21,473 --> 00:06:25,055
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be bright and shiny and everything's going to be new.

45
00:06:25,255 --> 00:06:38,945
[SPEAKER_03]: It will be sort of a core draw for the community, a place where there can be meetings, open forums, artistic performances in a city where we're short on all of those kinds of public places.

46
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,402
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a dream that was designed by so many for so long.

47
00:06:43,642 --> 00:06:49,164
[SPEAKER_07]: With the help of the Bloombergs, it's going to be a center of pride for generations to come.

48
00:06:51,405 --> 00:06:59,368
[SPEAKER_06]: It will mean a lot to me and to my sister to see our parents' names connected forever to a place that they cared deeply about.

49
00:07:10,653 --> 00:07:12,494
[SPEAKER_08]: Barbara, we're back with Barbara.

50
00:07:13,434 --> 00:07:15,295
[SPEAKER_08]: I have so many questions, Barbara.

51
00:07:15,915 --> 00:07:21,577
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me begin by asking, what does the typical day look like for a library director?

52
00:07:22,057 --> 00:07:23,198
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, first there's coffee.

53
00:07:25,085 --> 00:07:25,785
[SPEAKER_05]: That's important.

54
00:07:25,906 --> 00:07:26,346
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course.

55
00:07:26,386 --> 00:07:31,429
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I check in with the custodian, the office manager, and my department heads to see what's going on.

56
00:07:32,329 --> 00:07:40,914
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very rare that I have a day without at least one meeting, so a lot of meetings, because I'm the liaison with a lot of community groups.

57
00:07:41,515 --> 00:07:44,437
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I have a lot of ongoing projects that

58
00:07:45,357 --> 00:07:52,361
[SPEAKER_05]: are ongoing and then I sit there and dispense wise advice to everybody because they walk in and ask me questions and I give them answers.

59
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:54,403
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's interesting.

60
00:07:54,823 --> 00:07:57,845
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, the thing with public service is you never know what's going to happen.

61
00:07:57,925 --> 00:08:01,767
[SPEAKER_05]: So no day is ever exactly the same as the next one.

62
00:08:04,123 --> 00:08:06,844
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so let me ask you now, what do you enjoy?

63
00:08:07,124 --> 00:08:09,826
[SPEAKER_08]: What's the best part of your job?

64
00:08:10,006 --> 00:08:10,926
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you enjoy most?

65
00:08:11,266 --> 00:08:31,155
[SPEAKER_05]: What I liked for years was I really enjoyed being on the desk and interacting with the public, but now that I'm an administrator, I don't do that very often, because that was very nice, because you got to know people and you got to know what they were using in the library and what was working and what wasn't working.

66
00:08:31,935 --> 00:08:32,836
[SPEAKER_05]: So I miss that.

67
00:08:35,305 --> 00:08:51,589
[SPEAKER_05]: someday maybe once in a while they should just put me on the desk to keep because right now I don't know how things work a lot of the time and right when it comes to transferring phone calls sometimes I have to get help so But the the other thing that I like really very much and always have is ordering books.

68
00:08:52,369 --> 00:08:58,751
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my favorite thing because That's a great it's a great fun thing to do and I

69
00:09:00,293 --> 00:09:04,637
[SPEAKER_05]: We're a large enough library that we can purchase a lot of things.

70
00:09:04,837 --> 00:09:16,527
[SPEAKER_05]: And so trying to figure out what's trendy and what isn't trendy, and what people are interested in and what they're not, and what things that are classics that we don't have anymore, things like that.

71
00:09:16,547 --> 00:09:18,268
[SPEAKER_05]: So I enjoy that very much.

72
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:25,013
[SPEAKER_05]: I go into the book ordering platform and I kind of surf sometimes and look and think.

73
00:09:26,373 --> 00:09:29,195
[SPEAKER_08]: What are the challenges, I mean, with the libraries today?

74
00:09:29,215 --> 00:09:38,340
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of intellectual freedom challenges and book bans and things like that all over the country.

75
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:39,801
[SPEAKER_05]: That's been tough for the profession.

76
00:09:39,841 --> 00:09:45,004
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think one of the things that is hitting everybody is that since the pandemic,

77
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:55,091
[SPEAKER_05]: some of this like there's more of a demand for sort of social services okay in libraries in libraries yeah and that's

78
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:04,583
[SPEAKER_05]: In a way we've always done that to a certain degree because we've provided people with referrals to social services agencies when they needed them.

79
00:10:04,623 --> 00:10:08,064
[SPEAKER_05]: But now libraries are actually offering some of them.

80
00:10:08,084 --> 00:10:11,065
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have like citizenship classes and ESOL classes.

81
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:15,627
[SPEAKER_05]: And at one point the city's social worker was having office hours at the library.

82
00:10:15,847 --> 00:10:18,088
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's the kind of thing that

83
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:22,692
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's a post-pandemic development.

84
00:10:22,772 --> 00:10:24,334
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, yeah.

85
00:10:24,454 --> 00:10:29,980
[SPEAKER_08]: So you're actually getting people come and they can take a citizenship class at the library?

86
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,122
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, which is good.

87
00:10:32,162 --> 00:10:39,770
[SPEAKER_05]: This is our second session of ESOL classes and that's good because there's a lot of demand for services and

88
00:10:41,037 --> 00:10:46,461
[SPEAKER_05]: because we now have a facility that can accommodate a lot of different things at the same time.

89
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:48,562
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have rooms that people can use.

90
00:10:48,822 --> 00:10:49,142
[SPEAKER_05]: It's good.

91
00:10:49,403 --> 00:10:49,783
[SPEAKER_05]: So.

92
00:10:51,404 --> 00:10:51,744
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

93
00:10:51,824 --> 00:10:52,585
[SPEAKER_08]: Resources.

94
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:53,585
[SPEAKER_08]: To the public.

95
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:54,426
[SPEAKER_08]: What's available?

96
00:10:54,526 --> 00:10:56,107
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I. Everything.

97
00:10:56,607 --> 00:10:58,008
[SPEAKER_08]: I get in there occasionally.

98
00:10:58,028 --> 00:10:59,649
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't believe what's available.

99
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:02,611
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all the traditional library stuff.

100
00:11:02,631 --> 00:11:04,112
[SPEAKER_05]: So books and movies and music.

101
00:11:04,252 --> 00:11:07,575
[SPEAKER_05]: But now we have two e-book platforms.

102
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:19,749
[SPEAKER_05]: We have one through our library network that's like bestsellers and things and another one that we fund separately that's kind of more independent presses and things.

103
00:11:19,829 --> 00:11:25,396
[SPEAKER_05]: So basically you put your hold on the one for the network and we get things from the other one while you're waiting.

104
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:31,422
[SPEAKER_05]: That hoopla, which is the one that we pay for, also has video.

105
00:11:31,722 --> 00:11:39,248
[SPEAKER_05]: And it has a lot of streaming BBC things, so a lot of the BBC mysteries and things you can get on there.

106
00:11:39,889 --> 00:11:45,433
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have another platform called Canopy that's mostly independent films.

107
00:11:45,513 --> 00:11:50,117
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you go long enough, some of the blockbusters get in there, too.

108
00:11:50,657 --> 00:11:51,518
[SPEAKER_05]: And those are free.

109
00:11:51,538 --> 00:11:52,879
[SPEAKER_05]: You just need to have a library card.

110
00:11:53,617 --> 00:11:56,901
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, the next question is the rooms.

111
00:11:57,642 --> 00:12:00,126
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been in there a few times.

112
00:12:01,247 --> 00:12:02,890
[SPEAKER_08]: There's rooms all over the place.

113
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:05,553
[SPEAKER_08]: I did something with the veterans not long ago.

114
00:12:05,593 --> 00:12:06,554
[SPEAKER_08]: They made blankets.

115
00:12:07,836 --> 00:12:10,980
[SPEAKER_08]: The night we were there, I gotta say, it was a busy place.

116
00:12:11,621 --> 00:12:12,502
[SPEAKER_08]: a very busy place.

117
00:12:12,522 --> 00:12:22,830
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we have 14 rooms that people can book as opposed to the previous building where we had one that everybody shared so there was glitter all the time.

118
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:23,391
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

119
00:12:23,431 --> 00:12:33,058
[SPEAKER_05]: So right this minute we're in a little bit of a transition with people booking the rooms because we have a commercial product that we use to book the rooms.

120
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:39,724
[SPEAKER_05]: They're pretty much going out of business today and they didn't tell us until about three weeks ago so

121
00:12:41,359 --> 00:12:48,289
[SPEAKER_05]: For the next month, you could only book a room during November, but we have a new system in the pipeline.

122
00:12:48,329 --> 00:12:53,376
[SPEAKER_05]: So once that's up and running, I think I wrote it down, you can book a room.

123
00:12:56,789 --> 00:12:57,870
[SPEAKER_05]: once a month or something.

124
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:59,310
[SPEAKER_05]: So, there are, there's a bunch of them.

125
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:00,551
[SPEAKER_05]: There are small meeting rooms.

126
00:13:00,631 --> 00:13:00,811
[SPEAKER_05]: There's.

127
00:13:00,831 --> 00:13:01,011
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

128
00:13:01,211 --> 00:13:02,211
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's some large ones.

129
00:13:02,271 --> 00:13:03,272
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a really big one.

130
00:13:03,372 --> 00:13:05,693
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there's one that seats about 15 people.

131
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:06,253
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

132
00:13:06,793 --> 00:13:07,814
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's the maker space.

133
00:13:07,834 --> 00:13:08,634
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a tech lab.

134
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:17,158
[SPEAKER_05]: So, if you need to have a meeting, and also the smaller rooms people use during the day, you can book it for a two-hour walk if you want to study or something.

135
00:13:17,178 --> 00:13:17,298
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

136
00:13:17,318 --> 00:13:18,078
[SPEAKER_05]: Or take a test.

137
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:23,040
[SPEAKER_05]: We had somebody who, they went on a job interview on Zoom in one of the rooms.

138
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:23,641
[SPEAKER_05]: In one of the rooms.

139
00:13:23,661 --> 00:13:23,721
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

140
00:13:23,741 --> 00:13:25,722
[SPEAKER_05]: And she came out afterwards and said, I got the job.

141
00:13:25,782 --> 00:13:26,482
[SPEAKER_08]: So, that was great.

142
00:13:26,882 --> 00:13:32,605
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's a large, large amount of variety going on and people are using them for all different reasons.

143
00:13:32,705 --> 00:13:40,469
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's great because that was one of the things that was difficult in the old building because there wasn't a lot of public meeting space in the city.

144
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:42,150
[SPEAKER_08]: There isn't, that's correct.

145
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:44,872
[SPEAKER_05]: And we do so much of our own programming that trying to

146
00:13:45,752 --> 00:13:49,194
[SPEAKER_05]: make available space for other groups was, could be very problematic.

147
00:13:49,234 --> 00:13:56,957
[SPEAKER_05]: But now it's, it's, it's complicated and having the booking systems die didn't help, but.

148
00:13:57,097 --> 00:14:02,279
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, no, because my, yeah, the Mystic Players, the revival, I know they booked quite a few things up there.

149
00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:06,180
[SPEAKER_08]: So, to book it, it's a phone call, it's online.

150
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:12,063
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a phone, there is an online form under normal circumstances you can call.

151
00:14:13,454 --> 00:14:19,921
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's also a form now, but I think the form may not be available temporarily because we're only booking for November.

152
00:14:20,842 --> 00:14:27,629
[SPEAKER_05]: But there are some, I think we book them in, I wrote it down, but I don't know where I wrote it down.

153
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:39,574
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so you can you can book a room like if you're an organization you can book it once a month Okay, you want to yeah, and we do the bookings quarterly because all of our programming and scheduling is quarterly.

154
00:14:39,854 --> 00:14:46,177
[SPEAKER_05]: So We open once we get all our stuff and then we open up the booking to people who want to do it So and we think

155
00:14:47,317 --> 00:14:56,783
[SPEAKER_05]: that the new system we're going to be adding will let people book the spaces themselves, probably just for the small study rooms.

156
00:14:56,803 --> 00:14:58,044
[SPEAKER_08]: But still, that's nice.

157
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:06,250
[SPEAKER_05]: That's good, because we've had this product for a long time, but they just kind of were like, sorry, we're basically going out of business at the end of October.

158
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:07,030
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, yeah.

159
00:15:09,231 --> 00:15:12,753
[SPEAKER_08]: Special events, I know there's so many up there.

160
00:15:13,753 --> 00:15:20,795
[SPEAKER_08]: I do look at the calendar every month, and I mean, every day is... We have a crazy amount of programming.

161
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:21,996
[SPEAKER_05]: It's unbelievable.

162
00:15:22,116 --> 00:15:28,898
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, is there any... I know there's always something going on up there, and they seem to be well attended.

163
00:15:28,918 --> 00:15:29,718
[SPEAKER_05]: They are, generally.

164
00:15:29,738 --> 00:15:31,259
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything in particular?

165
00:15:31,699 --> 00:15:32,679
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, there's so many.

166
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:33,900
[SPEAKER_08]: It's incredible.

167
00:15:35,325 --> 00:15:39,588
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the things, we always try and have sort of literary programs.

168
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:47,093
[SPEAKER_05]: So, this is something that we've been doing since the spring, I think, is Vidya Sundaram is the poet laureate for the city.

169
00:15:47,393 --> 00:15:48,694
[SPEAKER_05]: So, she's doing a poetry group.

170
00:15:48,774 --> 00:15:52,496
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's, they read different poems and people read their poems.

171
00:15:53,337 --> 00:15:53,857
[SPEAKER_05]: So, that's good.

172
00:15:53,897 --> 00:15:57,500
[SPEAKER_05]: We also, we always do a lot of stuff National Poetry Month, which is April.

173
00:15:59,637 --> 00:16:05,917
[SPEAKER_05]: but it's good to have, and we also have a lot of authors and things, so this is a good program.

174
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:18,019
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of the other things, now that we have a larger room, we try and do some exercise things.

175
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:21,281
[SPEAKER_05]: So, this is for, this is not for seniors.

176
00:16:21,321 --> 00:16:23,602
[SPEAKER_05]: This is for all ages, I think adults.

177
00:16:24,163 --> 00:16:35,990
[SPEAKER_05]: There's also a mother and baby yoga class, which, where they turn the lights off, which is fine, except if you look down the hallway, it's a little creepy, because it's like the lights are off, and people are rolling around on the floor.

178
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:39,972
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's, this building allows us to do a lot of different things.

179
00:16:40,072 --> 00:16:41,153
[SPEAKER_05]: So, it's good.

180
00:16:43,188 --> 00:16:45,090
[SPEAKER_05]: And the maker space is a magic thing.

181
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:55,959
[SPEAKER_05]: That's something that we specifically wanted in this building, because before we built this building, the maker movement, people didn't want to just go to a lecture anymore.

182
00:16:55,979 --> 00:16:57,300
[SPEAKER_05]: They wanted to make something.

183
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:02,184
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's basically a public workshop.

184
00:17:02,484 --> 00:17:07,689
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a room with a cement floor and really sturdy tables with a lot of art and craft supplies.

185
00:17:07,729 --> 00:17:10,031
[SPEAKER_05]: So we do a lot of programming.

186
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:17,273
[SPEAKER_05]: where we'll do something like, I think there's a couple of pages here, stained glass or sewing or something.

187
00:17:17,613 --> 00:17:19,634
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's a group called the Mystic Makerspace.

188
00:17:20,154 --> 00:17:22,316
[SPEAKER_05]: And they do programs for us several times a month.

189
00:17:22,396 --> 00:17:28,939
[SPEAKER_05]: And we got a Cummings grant this year that's going to allow us to hire two people to run makerspace programming.

190
00:17:29,019 --> 00:17:32,181
[SPEAKER_05]: So programs that people can attend.

191
00:17:32,241 --> 00:17:37,824
[SPEAKER_05]: But also, the other idea with the makerspace is that it's a, that's what this is about is,

192
00:17:39,447 --> 00:17:41,589
[SPEAKER_05]: drop in is that you can come in and use it.

193
00:17:41,929 --> 00:17:48,715
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to take like a safety class and specific classes on how to use the sewing machines and things, and you get a badge.

194
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:53,159
[SPEAKER_05]: And then after that, you can book the space if you need to make curtains or something.

195
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,921
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

196
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:56,162
[SPEAKER_08]: That's pretty nice.

197
00:17:56,202 --> 00:17:57,683
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's a great thing.

198
00:17:57,744 --> 00:18:01,307
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like every program we have is full.

199
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,781
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's awesome.

200
00:18:03,921 --> 00:18:04,301
[SPEAKER_05]: That's great.

201
00:18:04,361 --> 00:18:16,029
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one of the things that because we started with a new building, we were able to put it in because I think there's a lot of other places who are being renovated and things where the maker space is like a closet.

202
00:18:16,736 --> 00:18:18,677
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, no, but I've been in the library.

203
00:18:18,717 --> 00:18:21,118
[SPEAKER_08]: You walk by it, there's always something going on in that room.

204
00:18:21,138 --> 00:18:22,479
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's very impressive.

205
00:18:22,819 --> 00:18:23,959
[SPEAKER_08]: Always something going on.

206
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:27,741
[SPEAKER_05]: My staff has not managed to light it on fire yet, even though they've threatened.

207
00:18:28,261 --> 00:18:29,402
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's for adults only.

208
00:18:29,422 --> 00:18:33,003
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, because there's a lot of power tools and things that aren't great.

209
00:18:33,523 --> 00:18:35,184
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep, sounds good.

210
00:18:35,884 --> 00:18:43,448
[SPEAKER_05]: So anybody who's interested, our new Makerspace staff are starting next week, so we'll be offering more stuff going forward.

211
00:18:43,468 --> 00:18:43,948
[SPEAKER_05]: Just in time.

212
00:18:47,332 --> 00:18:53,378
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the Cummings Foundation and East Cambridge Savings Bank were the big funders for that room.

213
00:18:53,659 --> 00:18:57,122
[SPEAKER_05]: So Cummings wants us to keep it up, which is great.

214
00:18:57,242 --> 00:18:59,525
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a three-year grant program.

215
00:18:59,925 --> 00:19:01,006
[SPEAKER_05]: We can do a lot of stuff.

216
00:19:01,326 --> 00:19:08,334
[SPEAKER_05]: I think what's interesting is we've always had a really robust programming schedule because we have a very active Friends of the Library group.

217
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:12,595
[SPEAKER_05]: So they always funded programming, and now we have a foundation.

218
00:19:12,615 --> 00:19:19,018
[SPEAKER_05]: They were founded to raise money for the new project, so they're also contributing to programs.

219
00:19:20,038 --> 00:19:21,399
[SPEAKER_05]: This is our quarterly newsletter.

220
00:19:21,439 --> 00:19:22,279
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the latest one.

221
00:19:22,299 --> 00:19:27,981
[SPEAKER_05]: It's 20 pages of stuff, and if you're interested in having it come to your email,

222
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:38,302
[SPEAKER_05]: If you go on our website, which is www.medfordlibrary.org, and go into programs, there's a place you can go and click on newsletter.

223
00:19:38,342 --> 00:19:45,484
[SPEAKER_05]: You can put your email in, and you'll get it quarterly, which is good, because there is so much stuff.

224
00:19:46,244 --> 00:19:48,324
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a little bit crazy how much stuff we have.

225
00:19:48,404 --> 00:19:50,525
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a young staff with a lot of energy.

226
00:19:52,397 --> 00:19:53,858
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a good thing and it's a bad thing.

227
00:19:53,878 --> 00:19:59,741
[SPEAKER_05]: So the good thing is, so coming up is, I was told to mention Teen Trivia Night, which is coming up.

228
00:19:59,841 --> 00:20:00,962
[SPEAKER_05]: That sounds interesting.

229
00:20:01,162 --> 00:20:03,003
[SPEAKER_05]: That's hilarious unless you're not a teen.

230
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:03,483
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

231
00:20:03,603 --> 00:20:07,706
[SPEAKER_05]: I was chaperoning once and sat in the corner and I didn't know any of the questions.

232
00:20:08,186 --> 00:20:08,726
[SPEAKER_05]: No idea.

233
00:20:09,206 --> 00:20:09,967
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a fun one.

234
00:20:13,089 --> 00:20:16,470
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm doing, we've added 55 plus programs recently.

235
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:16,931
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.

236
00:20:16,951 --> 00:20:20,873
[SPEAKER_05]: We put together a senior advisory board who are seniors, they come in once a month and

237
00:20:21,924 --> 00:20:23,986
[SPEAKER_05]: Like propose ideas for programming.

238
00:20:24,006 --> 00:20:41,240
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, and so there's a whole page of them here and they asked me december 10th to do a It's a lunch and learn to do a history of the library, which I actually did a zoom history of the library in 2021, but This is going to be the short version the short version.

239
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:41,941
[SPEAKER_05]: That will be good.

240
00:20:42,121 --> 00:20:47,625
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there's a bunch of 55 plus programs, which is great and then

241
00:20:48,986 --> 00:20:54,169
[SPEAKER_05]: a huge amount of programming for children and teens, which is wonderful.

242
00:20:54,189 --> 00:21:06,995
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was talking to the children's librarian yesterday, and there's a, there's something from birth till, I think children's is generally birth to sixth grade, and then above that is teen.

243
00:21:07,095 --> 00:21:15,740
[SPEAKER_05]: So every week there's a, there's a baby lap sit, then there's a toddler program, then there's a family story time, which is for the slightly older group, and then

244
00:21:17,141 --> 00:21:25,166
[SPEAKER_05]: They have something Lego Club and art smart which are for slightly older kids and they switch off week to week and They're great.

245
00:21:25,206 --> 00:21:35,333
[SPEAKER_05]: They do crafts and one of my trustees goes to the story time on Saturdays and does the craft just to see what we're doing which is good and then the teens have then they're also book groups for different ages and

246
00:21:36,516 --> 00:21:41,878
[SPEAKER_05]: Matt Heaton, who is a local musician, does a sing-along once a month that's standing room only.

247
00:21:41,898 --> 00:21:46,379
[SPEAKER_05]: And they've been doing dance parties lately, like themed.

248
00:21:46,419 --> 00:21:47,580
[SPEAKER_05]: They had a princess one.

249
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,040
[SPEAKER_05]: I missed the dinosaur one.

250
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,441
[SPEAKER_05]: I was sorry about that.

251
00:21:51,361 --> 00:21:52,742
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's great, because there's

252
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:59,617
[SPEAKER_05]: They're very creative, and they keep on, it's like it's something new every time.

253
00:21:59,798 --> 00:22:02,240
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not the same old tired story times.

254
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,061
[SPEAKER_05]: They come up with different things all the time.

255
00:22:05,262 --> 00:22:13,830
[SPEAKER_05]: And the teens in particular were the place to go after school, which can be a little terrifying on early release days, but mostly it's great.

256
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:18,093
[SPEAKER_05]: And they like the place, and they go to the programs,

257
00:22:21,097 --> 00:22:22,718
[SPEAKER_05]: The youth services people are really good.

258
00:22:23,178 --> 00:22:24,939
[SPEAKER_05]: They really like children and teens.

259
00:22:24,979 --> 00:22:26,660
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's great.

260
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:27,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is good.

261
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,140
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what it's all about.

262
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:33,103
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a ton of stuff, so I recommend if you're interested, arrange to get the newsletter.

263
00:22:33,123 --> 00:22:35,824
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we do it in print, so we have print copies.

264
00:22:35,844 --> 00:22:37,205
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you go about getting it, Barbara?

265
00:22:37,585 --> 00:22:40,846
[SPEAKER_05]: You go on our website, and there's a program tab at the top.

266
00:22:40,946 --> 00:22:41,306
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

267
00:22:41,346 --> 00:22:43,528
[SPEAKER_05]: And you scroll down there, and there's a thing that says newsletter.

268
00:22:43,988 --> 00:22:46,149
[SPEAKER_08]: And you can sign up for that?

269
00:22:46,249 --> 00:22:46,389
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

270
00:22:46,849 --> 00:22:47,229
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, OK.

271
00:22:47,269 --> 00:22:47,870
[SPEAKER_05]: That sounds interesting.

272
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:48,650
[SPEAKER_05]: It goes to your email.

273
00:22:50,446 --> 00:22:54,887
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we're very fortunate that we can do so much programming.

274
00:22:55,587 --> 00:22:55,807
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

275
00:22:55,867 --> 00:22:59,488
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I mean, it seems really, really busy.

276
00:22:59,508 --> 00:23:04,229
[SPEAKER_08]: There's constantly something going on between the rooms.

277
00:23:04,369 --> 00:23:06,530
[SPEAKER_05]: We had 224,000 visitors in the last year.

278
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:07,390
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

279
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:08,090
[SPEAKER_08]: That's pretty good.

280
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:08,650
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

281
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:11,331
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we're a hit, which is good.

282
00:23:11,351 --> 00:23:12,151
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously.

283
00:23:12,171 --> 00:23:13,071
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's a great thing.

284
00:23:13,091 --> 00:23:14,152
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's good.

285
00:23:14,352 --> 00:23:15,132
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a great thing.

286
00:23:15,152 --> 00:23:19,513
[SPEAKER_05]: Because before this, we had a good staff and we had a good library, but the facility

287
00:23:20,653 --> 00:23:27,477
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of things we couldn't do because if you plug too many things in, you blew all the fuses.

288
00:23:27,557 --> 00:23:37,263
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was what I was excited about when we were building the new building, was having a facility so that my staff could do what they're able to do without being

289
00:23:39,068 --> 00:23:40,249
[SPEAKER_05]: impeded by the building.

290
00:23:40,289 --> 00:23:53,460
[SPEAKER_05]: Because there was a famous crayon, melted crayon art program where they turned on three air-conditioned hair blowers, what do you call them, hair dryers at the same time and blew the fuses in the entire building.

291
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:57,203
[SPEAKER_05]: Now we have a lot of plugs and fuses and backups and

292
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:02,939
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a floor drain in the children's program room, which well, that's that's good.

293
00:24:02,959 --> 00:24:04,760
[SPEAKER_05]: It comes in handy.

294
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,843
[SPEAKER_05]: Boy, there can be a lot of apparently there's a shaving cream.

295
00:24:08,423 --> 00:24:11,226
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, program where that came in very handy.

296
00:24:11,446 --> 00:24:15,169
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's great to have a facility that is

297
00:24:16,713 --> 00:24:20,155
[SPEAKER_05]: lets my people do their best, because they're a very good group.

298
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:29,880
[SPEAKER_08]: You mentioned Friends of the Method Public Library, and I'm curious a little bit about them, but I mean volunteers.

299
00:24:30,821 --> 00:24:32,102
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have volunteers?

300
00:24:32,122 --> 00:24:34,383
[SPEAKER_08]: Do people volunteer at the library?

301
00:24:34,623 --> 00:24:34,803
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

302
00:24:34,883 --> 00:24:36,664
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you always looking for volunteers?

303
00:24:36,704 --> 00:24:38,285
[SPEAKER_08]: How does that work out?

304
00:24:38,325 --> 00:24:39,266
[SPEAKER_05]: So you email

305
00:24:40,625 --> 00:24:45,313
[SPEAKER_05]: Medford at minlib.net, which is M-I-N-L-I-B dot net.

306
00:24:45,794 --> 00:24:48,258
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that's our Minutemen Library Network thing.

307
00:24:48,879 --> 00:24:52,264
[SPEAKER_05]: And Sam, who is my assistant director, will get in touch.

308
00:24:53,478 --> 00:24:54,819
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a lot of stuff.

309
00:24:54,919 --> 00:25:05,166
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the youth, if they call the children's department, they have a lot of child, kid, and they have a lot of teen volunteers, because a lot of the teens have to do community service.

310
00:25:05,927 --> 00:25:07,188
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's quite a few.

311
00:25:07,208 --> 00:25:08,789
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, so they can do community service there.

312
00:25:08,949 --> 00:25:14,393
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they just have to make arrangements with the teen librarian to find something to do.

313
00:25:14,473 --> 00:25:15,154
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's good.

314
00:25:15,194 --> 00:25:16,315
[SPEAKER_08]: It's very active.

315
00:25:17,135 --> 00:25:17,356
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

316
00:25:17,716 --> 00:25:20,160
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know, you do a great job there.

317
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:20,721
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

318
00:25:20,781 --> 00:25:26,349
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, we could probably go on and talk for another two or three hours, I guess, but I can tell you the stories.

319
00:25:26,629 --> 00:25:29,213
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'm sure you can.

320

[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

321
00:25:29,634 --> 00:25:31,377
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'm sure you can.

322
00:25:34,937 --> 00:25:53,811
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I see we are getting near the end, so I want to thank our guest, Barbara Kerr, the director of the Charlotte and William Bloomberg Method Public Library, for sharing information about the services and the resources available at your public library.
