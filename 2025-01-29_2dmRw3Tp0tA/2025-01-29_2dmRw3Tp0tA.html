    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=49.573s">Oh,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=51.254s">Oh,</a>  nice to have you all. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=52.655s">Yeah,</a>  great to see you.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=79.802s">Hi,</a>  Laura. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=81.884s">Hi,</a>  Laura. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=82.345s">Good</a>  to see you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=83.265s">Good</a>  to see you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=84.947s">What's</a>  that?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=87.129s">I</a>  said you walked right by it like you didn't know it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=96.597s">I</a>  said you walked by it like you didn't know it.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=104.377s">Yeah,</a>  she's doing pretty good.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=134.778s">We</a>  are here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=135.459s">You</a>  were in my ear.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=136.48s">I</a>  was like, you know we're in Italy, and where else? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=139.224s">I</a>  know, but where am I? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=140.685s">I'm</a>  in Italy, that's what I saw on Facebook. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=154.458s">I'm</a>  glad you're here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=156.039s">Of</a>  course, the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=157.48s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=180.836s">And</a>  then his own wife. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=182.537s">He's</a>  in his area. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=184.138s">Oh,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=185.099s">His</a>  wife is. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=186.62s">So</a>  she does, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=187.6s">She</a>  does the housekeeping. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=192.123s">I</a>  love you so much.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=193.584s">I</a>  love you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=194.845s">I</a>  miss you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=195.285s">I</a>  love you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=195.845s">I</a>  didn't miss you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=197.226s">You</a>  should have a great time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=199.167s">I</a>  could watch it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=201.148s">I</a>  could watch it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=208.092s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=231.192s">You</a>  love a good concert. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=276.468s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=277.149s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=292.925s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=319.992s">I'm</a>  going to have you on this side.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=323.294s">Watch</a>  out for any cables.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=367.15s">That</a>  looks good, Mark. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=378.395s">Mark</a>  can you actually just pan that shot to the right a tiny bit so we don't lose Terry. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=397.709s">Yeah,</a>  that's good, that's good right there.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=439.485s">Well,</a>  good evening, friends and neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=441.405s">My</a>  name is Terry E. Cotter, and I direct Elder Services here at our beloved West Medford Community Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=449.266s">Welcome</a>  to another live monthly presentation of Fresh Fridays, Words, and Music, rebranded <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=458.082s">Cobb</a>  and Sanders for February. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=460.023s">It's</a>  Black History Month. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=461.884s">We're</a>  happy to be with you tonight, following up our epic Martin Luther King Jr. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=467.766s">Day</a>  celebration at St. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=469.287s">Rayfield's</a>  Paris Center in January, and getting back to our culture-keeping duties here at 111 Arlington Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=477.41s">Thanks</a>  as always to the assistance of the Medford Arts Council, a member of the Massachusetts Cultural Council for help with funding this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=491.579s">And</a>  it definitely is starting to do that now. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=493.182s">We</a>  want to remind you that COVID and RSV and a bunch of new flus are out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=499.689s">We're</a>  still trying to be mindful of local health requirements and concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=504.471s">Masking</a>  is welcome, but it's not required. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=507.292s">As</a>  always, we're just happy to have you in the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=510.494s">We're</a>  happy to be here sponsoring live programming. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=513.996s">And</a>  we're glad to see our neighbors, our friends, and supporters coming through the doors. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=518.878s">Thank</a>  you so much for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=521.659s">Thanks</a>  also to our other event partner, Kevin Harrington and Medford Community Media for consistently guiding us as we broadcast you via Medford Community Media, channels 9 for Comcast and 47 for Verizon, as well as on MCM YouTube. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=541.311s">If</a>  you're out there watching the show on your electronic devices or your television, welcome to the show. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=549.156s">So</a>  before we get to the main business for the evening, we do want to extend community condolences to the families of Charlie Paris and Ruth Youngblood, two dear friends of the center and great civic-minded citizens of the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=565.364s">Their</a>  recent losses represent huge tears in the fabric of this neighborhood, and they are both remembered with respect and fondness by all of us here at WMCC. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=578.812s">So</a>  in my travels as a poet and something of an ambassador for the arts here in Medford, I've been privileged to encounter some tremendous teachers, leaders, and history makers across a wide panorama of human endeavor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=594.655s">Words</a>  and Music has given me the great opportunity to bring a lot of those folks to your attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=600.136s">Tonight</a>  is no exception, so I hope you're ready for all things insightful and delightful. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=607.958s">Can't</a>  help it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=608.819s">I</a>  just can't help it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=610.52s">So</a>  our guest for this portion of the evening's program is not new to Medford, but she continues to make a significant and positive impression on everyone who has crossed her path. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=621.667s">She</a>  is the executive director of the historic Royal House and Slave Quarters right off of Main Street just beyond Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=629.632s">Now</a>  the Royal House and Slave Quarters, the former family estate of Isaac Royal, is recognized as a living, breathing reflection of history and existence of a slave quarters and legal slavery in Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=644.141s">It</a>  is a national historical landmark, now operated as a non-profit museum, and open for public visits between June 1st and the last weekend in October. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=655.147s">Please</a>  allow me to introduce to some and reacquaint with others the head chef of all that's cooking at RHSQ, Dr. Kiara Singleton. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=669.059s">Okay,</a>  now this is going to take just a minute to unpack. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=672.302s">Kiara</a>  holds a PhD, earned PhD, from the University of Michigan Ann Arbor in the Department of American Culture. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=680.329s">She</a>  is also a postdoctoral fellow for the Slavery, Colonialism, and Their Legacies Project at Tufts University. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=688.336s">Between</a>  2021 and 2023, Kiara Singleton was an American Democracy fellow <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=694.441s">in</a>  the Charles Warren Center at Harvard University, and she has held a number of prestigious academic fellowships. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=704.344s">As</a>  a public history scholar, Kiara is one of the co-curators of the Boston Slavery Exhibit at Faneuil Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=711.787s">She</a>  was a member of the Table of Voices cohort at the Museum of Fine Arts Boston for the Hear Me Now exhibit, the Black Partisans of Old Edgefield, South Carolina. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=722.61s">She</a>  has been appointed to serve on the City of Boston's Commemoration Commission and the Special Commission on the 250th anniversary of the American Revolution for Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=734.918s">Her</a>  accolades have really, really piled up in recent years. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=740.381s">There</a>  are really too many to mention, but in October of 2023, she received a Women of Courage and Conviction Award from the National Council <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=750.928s">of</a>  Negro women in an official citation from the Massachusetts State Senate for her work in documenting the history of slavery. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=759.17s">She</a>  is a board member for Mass Humanities and serves on the advisory team for Just Flicks, a youth-focused storytelling organization in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=768.452s">Kiara</a>  is also a member of the Board of Public Humanities Fellows at Brown University, which brings together a collection of museum leaders from Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Connecticut. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=780.935s">She</a>  has reestablished the Royal House and Slave Quarters prominence as the only remaining such structure in the Northeast and has worked tirelessly, along with a dedicated board and a small army of volunteers and supporters, to advance the relevance of this special history throughout New England. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=799.439s">With</a>  seasonal tours and educational programs throughout the year, the museum is one of Medford's true historical treasures. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=808.081s">Again,</a>  please welcome Dr. Kiara Singleton. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=810.622s">you</a> </p>

    <p>[nzT0OcLHmhc_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=816.135s">I</a>  need to make an abbreviated bio.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=820.079s">I</a>  abbreviated the one you sent me. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=823.882s">I'm</a>  serious, Carrie. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=824.903s">I</a>  mean, you're shaking and moving all over the historical landscape. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=829.207s">So</a>  yeah, I'm happy to be able to share it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=832.99s">So</a>  as is my custom in hosting these evenings, and I hope you'll bear with me, I'd like to share a bit of verse to help shape the evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=842.899s">You</a>  know by now that I believe that poetry should be, above all things, accessible and inclusive. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=849.581s">Sometimes,</a>  like the times we're in right now, it also has to have a little bite to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=857.283s">This</a>  piece is called We Earned It. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=860.083s">A</a>  song poet said, no less than the rocks and the trees, we have a right to be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=871.036s">You</a>  want to find corners, cells, closets, fences, borders, and barriers to close us in or shut us out. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=878.84s">Study</a>  the history, the real history, not the sugar-coated, sanitized, or whitewashed. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=885.242s">The</a>  Middle Passage wasn't a picnic, a pleasure trip, a sacred crusade, or a pastoral visit. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=891.746s">We</a>  were kidnapped, hijacked, and in a word, stolen from our sheltering sun, our greener fields, our shady groves, our spiritual pantheons, our melanated diversity, and our cultural divinity. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=906.86s">Doors</a>  and gates of no return lapped at the frigid waters of our disconnection from the lands, laws, lords, and villages of our native birth. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=917.551s">Foreign</a>  invaders took our kindness for weakness, took our curiosity for acquiescence, took our culture and our art, our music, our treasured symbols, and our native creativity by force when necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=931.257s">And</a>  they always thought it was necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=934.038s">Confined</a>  to cabin and field, quartered and squalor, hired by North Carolina tobacco bonds, Florida cane breaks, Mississippi mudflats, Alabama cotton kingdoms and Virginia plantation subjugation, beaten but never broken, chained but never conquered, bloody but unbowed, ravaged, reviled, and raped, but resolute and revolutionary. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=958.368s">We</a>  know you don't want to hear it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=959.99s">White</a>  fragility is a real thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=962.352s">Erasure</a>  and elimination is a love language for you right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=966.216s">Nothing</a>  new to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=967.258s">We've</a>  been here before. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=969.12s">Our</a>  freedom has never been gladly awarded, graciously given, or peacefully conceded. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=974.447s">There</a>  has always been a war that rages of the head, the heart, the body, and the spirit. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=980.332s">Always</a>  been battlefields, burial sites, scorched earth, and secret societies. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=985.998s">There</a>  have always been Confederate aspirations, supremacist machinations, violent perpetrations, and terrorist preparations. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=994.501s">We've</a>  always made a way out of no way. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=997.482s">We</a>  are not a people of constant need and pauper's greed. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1000.603s">We</a>  are not a people of government subsidy and happy poverty. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1004.644s">We</a>  are not a people of locusts, land grants, and entitlements. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1008.825s">We</a>  are not freeloaders, panhandlers, beggars, or vagrants. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1013.486s">We</a>  have glory and pride, and we're dignified. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1017.627s">We</a>  are overcomers. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1019.708s">We</a>  are the victory over American apartheid. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1022.912s">We</a>  are the straw that broke the back of chattel slavery and colonial domination. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1027.697s">We</a>  are not a footnote, a parenthetical expression, or an asterisk. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1032.462s">We</a>  are creative genius and collective wisdom. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1036.166s">We</a>  are athletic prowess and aesthetic brilliance. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1039.51s">We</a>  are civic engagement and political action. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1042.851s">We</a>  are military leadership, courage under fire, and valorous service. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1047.932s">We</a>  are builders, engineers, contractors, and surveyors. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1051.794s">We</a>  are teachers, trainers, and trendsetters. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1054.554s">We</a>  are history makers, curse breakers, and territory takers. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1058.156s">We</a>  are healers, heralds, and heroes. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1060.516s">We</a>  are heroines, homemakers, and humanitarians. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1063.397s">We</a>  are prophets, preachers, and philanthropists. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1065.88s">We</a>  are comedians, filmmakers, and risk takers. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1070.545s">We</a>  are researchers, detectives, and discoverers. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1073.928s">We</a>  are the straw that stirs the drink, breaks the camel's back, and makes the best bricks. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1081.016s">We</a>  have earned it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1082.958s">We</a>  inherited little other than our good names and righteous faith. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1086.6s">We</a>  have not easily

endeth the poet's story. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1120.899s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1122.479s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1123.84s">So</a>  that's how we're going to move. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1127.182s">Now</a>  let's have a friendly chat with Dr. Kara Singleton. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1131.712s">Okay,</a>  so Kira, you're not from New England.</p>

    <p>[nzT0OcLHmhc_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1134.094s">No,</a>  I am not.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1134.875s">No,</a>  tell us a bit about how you got here and why you stayed.</p>

    <p>[nzT0OcLHmhc_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1137.898s">Yeah,</a>  so although I'm not from, well first, thank you so much for having me. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1142.282s">It's</a>  always a pleasure to be in conversation with you and also to be at the West Medford Community Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1149.428s">I</a>  am originally from Camden, New Jersey. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1153.089s">So</a>  if anyone knows where Camden, New Jersey is, it's right across from Philadelphia. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1159.19s">Literally,</a>  it's separated by the Ben Franklin Bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1164.071s">I</a>  grew up there and I went off to college and I went to Minnesota for college, a small school called McAllister. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1174.633s">And</a>  there, I really, really, really <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1180.355s">decided</a>  that my passion was to study slavery. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1185.397s">And</a>  from there I went to grad school, from grad school I ended up here and I think it's really been perfect in many ways because not only do I get to write about the history of slavery, something that I love learning about and talking about, <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1205.184s">But</a>  also my job is to do it every single day. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1210.866s">And</a>  for some people, that can be a little overwhelming. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1212.747s">They're</a>  like, you really want to talk about slavery every day? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1215.808s">And</a>  I'm like, I know, I understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1217.809s">But</a>  I think for me, so much about understanding our past is also about understanding our current moment and imagining what a future could be. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1227.053s">So</a>  I like to think of it as an entryway to also knowing ourselves.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1230.915s">OK,</a>  OK, perfect, perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1235.803s">What,</a>  if anything, did you know about Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1239.385s">And</a>  can you talk a little bit about being courted by the Royal House Board and becoming the current executive director?</p>

    <p>[nzT0OcLHmhc_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1248.062s">So</a>  it's actually a really interesting and funny story that in so many ways, the royal house and slave quarters, I don't know how to describe it other than my first time in Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1266.946s">My</a>  very first time in Boston was in 2019. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1270.087s">I</a>  came for a conference at Harvard, and that was because my advisor left Michigan, came to Harvard, <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1277.348s">I</a>  was living in Atlanta, not necessarily working on my dissertation as much as I should have been. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1282.091s">And</a>  she called me one day and she said, you know, you know, I went to graduate school straight out of undergrad, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1290.057s">So</a>  I was like all over the place. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1291.298s">She</a>  said, you know, I always said I would let you wander and then I will pull you back. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1296.802s">It's</a>  time to finish. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1298.563s">And</a>  I was like, do I have to leave Atlanta to do that? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1301.145s">And</a>  she said, do you have funding in Atlanta? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1303.226s">And</a>  I said, you're right. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1306.108s">said</a>  you're gonna come on over to Massachusetts because that's where I'm at and that's where you have funding so I said all right so I came and I was like all right let me see let me imagine my life here the conference was at Harvard so I came to check it out and actually a professor at Tufts was giving the keynote and she started talking about the royal house and slave quarters and she's like you know <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1327.502s">there's</a>  a slave quarters in the north. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1330.343s">And</a>  I was like, no, there's not. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1331.484s">I</a>  study slavery. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1332.144s">I</a>  would know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1333.084s">I'm</a>  from New Jersey. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1334.185s">I</a>  would know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1335.225s">So</a>  I pull out my phone because I'm Googling it and I'm like, why didn't I know this? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1340.047s">And</a>  so I had all of my friends who were at the conference with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1343.208s">We</a>  went and we took a tour and we just stayed in the meeting room afterwards and we talked and I never forgot about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1352.492s">And</a>  then a year later, <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1354.502s">the</a>  job posting came up, and that same advisor who told me it was time to finish my dissertation sent it to me and said, I think you would like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1363.988s">And</a>  I applied, and I got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1366.05s">And</a>  I mean, honestly, in so many ways, it feels like it's fate. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1369.612s">I</a>  love my job. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1371.133s">I</a>  have a really cool job. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1373.795s">And</a>  at the same time, I felt like from that moment that I encountered it, I was never able to stop thinking about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1382.18s">I</a>  don't know if they courted me or if I courted them, actually.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1384.821s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1385.501s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1385.841s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1386.141s">Well,</a>  that's interesting because, you know, and I've asked this question before when I've had, you know, another person sitting in the seat that you're sitting now. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1395.743s">Do</a>  you think that there was anything significant that, you know, that the hiring committee was looking for that made you like a preferred candidate? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1407.006s">I</a>  mean, what did they see in you that they maybe didn't see in anybody else that they were talking to?</p>

    <p>[nzT0OcLHmhc_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1414.788s">I</a>  can give the non-political answer.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1417.289s">This</a>  is a political crowd. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1419.67s">You</a>  can go with the political answer for these folks.</p>

    <p>[nzT0OcLHmhc_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1423.731s">So</a>  it's a great question. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1424.851s">I</a>  think there are a few different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1428.072s">One,</a>  I came in as a scholar. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1431.214s">And</a>  so coming in with the background meant that already there was going to be a different type of engagement with the space for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1440.563s">In</a>  the sense that, you know, I came in and I looked around and I, you know, I went on the tour, I heard the history, and immediately I started thinking about, this is amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1450.032s">What</a>  else can we do? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1451.073s">How</a>  can we expand the narrative? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1453.194s">How</a>  can we do more research? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1456.497s">So</a>  I would like to say that my enthusiasm was one of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1459.899s">My</a>  training was another. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1461.901s">I</a>  think the other part of that is also that I am the first black woman to lead the museum. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1471.047s">And</a>  so on top of all of my training, on top of my vision, <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1478.432s">you</a>  know, it doesn't hurt, you know, to and I'm very proud of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1483.335s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1483.615s">To</a>  say that, you know, I can come in and not only talk about this history because it's important, but I can also talk about this history as a descendant of, you know, enslaved people. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1498.583s">You</a>  know, you know, so it's it's it you know, I felt like it it felt perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1502.685s">And</a>  for me, it also felt perfect to also <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1506.007s">step</a>  outside and be really honest about why I do that work. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1509.868s">Yes,</a>  I do the work because I love history. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1512.609s">The</a>  other reason why I do that work is because I also learn about my family history. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1518.912s">I</a>  love helping other people learn about their family history. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1521.673s">I</a>  love <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1523.073s">people</a>  understanding how integral black people were to the building of this country, the skills that we had. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1531.915s">You</a>  know, for me it's a point of pride to be able to talk about this history and also to help other people feel and have some pride about it as well.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1541.318s">I</a>  love it, I love it, very good, very good. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1543.699s">So</a>  now you, you came from, you went from <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1551.118s">McAllister</a>  to Atlanta to Michigan to Michigan. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1555.782s">OK,</a>  then to Atlanta. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1557.883s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1558.424s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1560.445s">First</a>  Jersey, obviously, and then up to Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1564.168s">OK,</a>  so Boston is clearly different from all of those places. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1569.433s">What</a>  has it been about this area that has been engaging to you and then what is it that has been most challenging in terms of the other places that you've been and maybe loved a little bit?</p>

    <p>[nzT0OcLHmhc_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1583.948s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1586.23s">OK,</a>  so I'm a part of the very weird few people when people say, do you like it? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1591.533s">I'm</a>  like, yes, I do. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1595.436s">And</a>  I always have to, like, brace for people to be like, really? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1600.039s">But</a>  it's OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1600.699s">It's</a>  now a thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1601.5s">It's</a>  a joke amongst my friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1603.862s">Everyone's</a>  going to be like, uh, Kiara's going to talk about how much she likes Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1607.924s">But</a>  I think there are a few reasons why I like it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1610.206s">I</a>  think one I'm close to home I left to go to college when I was 18. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1614.088s">I</a>  spent most of my time not being close to home actually And so there's something very special about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1620.952s">You</a>  know, I'm from you know, I <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1623.733s">the</a>  East Coast like, you know, I know how to get around. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1626.696s">It</a>  feels comfortable to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1627.897s">I</a>  think the other part of it is that this place is full of history. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1634.362s">And</a>  I can't imagine doing the work that I do anywhere else. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1638.166s">It's</a>  not to say that I couldn't, but literally you walk the streets and you just understand how historical it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1646.153s">And</a>  more importantly, <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1649.056s">how</a>  many communities have been working to preserve their history and they were doing it on their own before it became the hottest thing to study right now in Massachusetts, which is slavery. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1663.415s">And</a>  so I think I've learned a lot from community members who have told me, oh, go look at this archive. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1670.197s">Have</a>  you heard about this? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1671.497s">Or</a>  I want you to do this or here's this thing that I've saved. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1675.878s">To</a>  me, I felt very welcomed. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1679.038s">And</a>  it felt like I was, it feels like I'm here doing what I'm supposed to do and doing it in community and for community. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1687.74s">I</a>  think what's challenging about it is that Boston is not Atlanta. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1691.443s">No,</a>  it's not a Mecca. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1695.467s">And</a>  so I think sometimes a part of when people go, you really like it here? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1700.971s">Is</a>  that because they don't see many people who look like us. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1704.133s">But</a>  I am not a person who is going to take that as fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1709.998s">So</a>  a part of what I have done is I've been like, all right, where are the black people? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1713.921s">I'm</a>  going to go find them. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1715.222s">And</a>  guess what? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1715.882s">I</a>  have found them. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1717.683s">So</a>  it does take a little getting out of, you know, specifically that Harvard Cambridge bubble and going to places and, you know, showing up, like going and, you know, meeting people. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1730.067s">And</a>  because I've done that, I've built a really nice community. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1732.628s">And</a>  so for me, I think a part of, you know, I understand why this is a very challenging place, that it's very clear to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1742.771s">And</a>  at the same time, it has had a historic black community since the, you know, 17th, 18th century. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1751.639s">And</a>  we're here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1752.9s">You</a>  just gotta you just gotta find the people.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1754.721s">That's</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1755.282s">That's</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1755.902s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1756.643s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1757.103s">So.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1760.66s">We're</a>  in a, you know, and I said it before, I'll say it again, we're in kind of a challenging place right now, historically. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1768.026s">How</a>  have the last few years kind of gotten you ready for the next few and beyond that?</p>

    <p>[nzT0OcLHmhc_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1774.45s">Oh,</a>  that's a really good question and a hard question. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1787.24s">I</a>  guess I would answer it like, <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1792.297s">I'm</a>  not even sure it's just been the last few years, you know, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1800.103s">we've</a>  been seeing so much happen in the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1806.927s">I</a>  think that there's something to be said about seeing the spirit of how people organize, how they rush into the streets, how they demand justice, how we speak back, knowing that there are gonna be consequences to that, but you do it anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1826.399s">And</a>  so for me, I think I have been really held and inspired by the many activists, whether we're talking about George Floyd, whether we're talking about Palestine, whether we're talking about speaking back against a repressive government right now, people who have <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1849.12s">always</a>  been fighting and remind us that historically, you know, we have to organize in order to win. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1859.193s">And</a>  so I think <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1861.049s">for</a>  me, the next few years is all about learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1865.371s">I</a>  mean, right now, my moment is about learning in order to make it to the next few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1869.932s">And</a>  to remember that there have been people who have been living through all types of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1878.875s">And</a>  they have been coming up with strategies. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1881.036s">And</a>  I like to say that at this moment, it's not a time <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1884.357s">to</a>  feel hopeless. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1887.938s">In</a>  fact, it's a time for us to learn from the reproductive justice workers in Mississippi, who for them, it has always been challenging to have reproductive care. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1901.602s">So</a>  they've always had to take care of one another and create systems in order to take care of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1911.045s">we</a>  can look to fast food workers who are striking all throughout the country for a better and higher wage, despite the type of violence and retaliation that they were being met with. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1924.508s">And</a>  so again, there have been people who have been organizing, and they've been surviving. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1929.669s">And</a>  I think if we also look to Europe and think through the rise of different fascist governments there since 2010, 2011, <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1941.693s">you</a>  also see that they haven't quite taken over. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1945.215s">So</a>  it's a reminder that there are people in this country and across the world who have been fighting these battles as well, and I think we should be learning from them and with them in order to resist and to keep going.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1961.266s">Absolutely,</a>  and at the risk of quoting history to a historian, <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1967.01s">the</a>  Civil Rights Movement never ended. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1970.131s">And</a>  what is interesting and hopefully engaging is that we now have some generations that have no real reckoning with the Civil Rights Movement who are gonna have to get up to speed real quick, and they're gonna have to get, as you say, out in the streets, because that's where the battle's gonna be fought. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1992.684s">So</a>  yeah, it's... <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=1996.206s">Okay,</a>  so let's go back to the museum for a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2000.949s">You've</a>  accomplished some things, certainly. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2003.671s">What</a>  accomplishments come to mind that you're kind of proud of and that you want to see continue to move forward?</p>

    <p>[nzT0OcLHmhc_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2022.504s">I</a>  think <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2025.312s">My</a>  biggest accomplishment, or the accomplishment that feels the most important to me in this moment, is that we started an art summer program. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2041.385s">in</a>  which we work with 10 students, working with artist Stephen Hamilton from Boston, who is a weaver and a painter. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2051.692s">And</a>  we taught kids how to weave, how to paint, how to do tie and dye, resist batiking. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2065.081s">And</a>  then when they were done over that seven weeks, <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2068.783s">They</a>  had an art exhibition that opened up at Harvard last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2073.664s">And</a>  to me, it's one of the proudest things I've ever done in the sense of, you know, this is I run a museum on the history of slavery. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2084.846s">It</a>  is a former plantation site. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2086.987s">And</a>  yet it's not lost on me that even though, you know, we always need more funding, we can still give back. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2094.308s">And</a>  so it's one of the ways that we've been doing that with youth programming. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2101.232s">And</a>  I think just really seeing how students took to the work so quickly, but more importantly, how they mostly were like, I guess, can we do this? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2113.138s">The</a>  first day, Steven came in and was like, okay, we're gonna make bags. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2116.6s">And</a>  they're like, we don't know how to sew. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2117.941s">And</a>  he's like, I know, isn't that something? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2120.422s">By</a>  the end, you're gonna make a bag. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2122.424s">And</a>  they're like, no, we're not. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2124.265s">He's</a>  like, I have you for six hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2126.126s">I</a>  promise you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2127.547s">And</a>  then they had bags at the end, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2130.67s">And</a>  so also just, you know, I think for me seeing how they were skeptical at first and then they trusted us. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2140.157s">And</a>  then at the end when they could bring their friends and family to the gallery, <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2144.64s">You</a>  know, they were taking pictures. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2148.441s">And</a>  they were like, wow, we actually did this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2151.121s">This</a>  was a big deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2152.061s">And</a>  so I think just providing spaces for students to learn about the history, but also to learn important traditions that came with us from the continent and the Caribbean.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2164.123s">They</a>  absolutely did. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2165.684s">Absolutely</a>  did. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2167.304s">Challenges.</a> </p>

    <p>[nzT0OcLHmhc_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2170.144s">Oh,</a>  there are lots of those.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2172.185s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[nzT0OcLHmhc_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2179.065s">Yeah,</a>  so obviously I think I want everyone to come to the museum. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2186.43s">I</a>  think there's something really important about being there, walking through the museum, understanding the history. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2194.536s">And</a>  so it is one of the biggest challenges is how do we keep raising the visibility? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2199.8s">How</a>  do we keep pushing ourselves through programming, through the way that we tell <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2206.545s">the</a>  history, how do we try to get every school child in the state of Massachusetts to know the name of Belinda Sutton, who is one of the black women who was enslaved on the plantation, but then had a successful petition that gave her reparations, one of the earliest in the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2228.499s">I</a>  want people <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2229.5s">to</a>  know her name as much as they know Frederick Douglass' name, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2234.181s">And</a>  so the challenge is about, you know, really making that history accessible, invisible, and constantly, obviously, you know, fundraising in order to do the work that needs to be <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2248.085s">done.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2248.666s">But</a>  I think for me, a part of the challenge is there's so much to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2255.256s">And</a>  also understanding that I take the work very seriously. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2263.087s">And</a>  my board takes the work very seriously. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2264.948s">And</a>  making sure that we still get people there by not just only wanting to talk about the things that I want to talk about, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2277.576s">Which</a>  is like, <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2278.456s">let's</a>  talk about the history of slavery. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2279.797s">Do</a>  you know about the body of liberties? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2283.798s">Maybe</a>  that's not appealing to everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2286.559s">But</a>  what might be appealing is, I don't know, a poetry slam, or a arts program, or sewing classes, which we just did for MLK weekend. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2303.286s">And</a>  if that is what community members <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2307.067s">want</a>  to do, and that's how I get them into the door, then I guess that's what I have to do, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2311.61s">So</a>  just being attuned and asking people, well, what do you want to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2315.112s">What</a>  do you want to do here? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2317.873s">How</a>  can you make this space your own? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2319.994s">And</a>  then I get to sneak in the history, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2321.635s">Then</a>  if you're here, then you can go on a tour.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2323.776s">And</a>  we do it all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2324.957s">You</a>  go on a tour.</p>

    <p>[nzT0OcLHmhc_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2326.358s">You</a>  can learn everything that I want you to take away from the site, but also not everyone's going to be able to get. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2334.062s">to</a>  the site. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2334.662s">So</a>  my next challenge is how do we bring the Royal House and Slave Quarters to Dorchester? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2340.284s">How</a>  do we bring the Royal House and Slave Quarters to Roxbury? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2343.946s">How</a>  do we get out to Mattapan? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2345.967s">That</a>  means that we have to go to people instead of always expecting people to come to us.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2351.989s">Wow,</a>  that's brilliant, that's brilliant. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2355.372s">So</a>  again, we're in this current state of racial reckoning for some, and a growing retreat from a healthy dialogue about diversity, equity, and inclusion for others. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2369.862s">What</a>  do you think that means for a cultural institution like yours?</p>

    <p>[nzT0OcLHmhc_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2375.614s">Oh,</a>  I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2377.095s">I'm</a>  thinking about it a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2378.536s">I'm</a>  thinking about it every day.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2379.757s">Yeah,</a>  I know we are, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2382.238s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2382.718s">It's</a>  scary, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2384.059s">Yeah,</a>  it is.</p>

    <p>[nzT0OcLHmhc_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2385.54s">But.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2389.082s">I</a>  mean, I don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2390.886s">I</a>  honestly don't have an answer other than I'm gonna keep doing what I'm doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2396.51s">And</a>  that's because I'm talking about the history, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2399.993s">You</a>  can't, like, what are you gonna say to me that didn't happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2404.796s">Like,</a>  that's not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2407.458s">And</a>  to be completely honest, I think, you know, these things really, <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2412.777s">worry</a>  me, and at the same time, I am always reminded by something that a mentor told me early on in grad school when I was like, do I even wanna do this? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2424.58s">What</a>  am I doing? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2425.74s">I'm</a>  23, I can't believe I'm here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2428.641s">Why</a>  did I sign up for this? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2429.861s">I</a>  should not be doing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2433.242s">But</a>  I wanna do this, but what am I doing? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2436.563s">And</a>  I'm like, will I get a job? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2439.484s">And</a>  she told me, <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2441.899s">when</a>  people started doing black studies, they didn't know if they were gonna get a job. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2449.583s">That</a>  wasn't the motivation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2451.043s">The</a>  motivation was to start these black studies programs, to get their degrees, to do the history, to write the books, so that no one can say that we weren't there. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2463.97s">And</a>  it's not to say that people do not deserve jobs, I wanna be very clear, but I think my motivation is to do the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2471.622s">And</a>  I'm gonna do the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2474.223s">I'm</a>  gonna do the work publicly, loudly, visibly. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2478.585s">And</a>  if for some reason I have to reimagine a way to do it, I'm gonna reimagine how to still do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2484.888s">I'm</a>  going to not back down. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2489.93s">And</a>  a part of that is because I don't know how to back away from telling the truth. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2495.892s">And</a>  as a scholar, it is literally my responsibility to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2500.913s">As</a>  a museum leader, it is also my responsibility to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2504.374s">But</a>  it's also my responsibility, you know, not just to the site, but to my ancestors to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2510.795s">And</a>  so I think, I don't know, I'm gonna just keep on keeping on. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2514.756s">You</a>  know, hope that <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2520.527s">you</a>  know, all that matters is that the work can still be done, however it needs to get done. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2526.469s">But</a>  it is scary times that we're in. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2531.45s">And</a>  at the same time, you know, it doesn't stop.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2535.231s">It's</a>  invigorating as a matter of fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2537.292s">You</a>  know, it's funny because we're kindred spirits in that regard. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2540.713s">You</a>  know, you as a scholar, me as a poet, I guess I'm a scholarly poet, I like to say that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2545.835s">But</a>  anyways, <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2548.469s">I</a>  think probably for the first time in my life as a writer, I had one of those moments where I said, ooh, did I really want to say this? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2558.792s">And</a>  I think that scared me more than anything else that was going on, is that it put me in a place where I was thinking retreat. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2568.454s">But</a>  the good thing about it is that my other sensibilities, as yours do, I'm sure, slapped me around real quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2576.296s">They</a>  said, get out of there. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2578.138s">You're</a>  going to say exactly what you've always been saying, because what you've always been saying is what needs to be said right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2586.164s">And</a>  I said some of it five years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2588.726s">I</a>  look back on some of the writing that I've done. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2591.268s">I</a>  said some of it seven and 10 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2595.672s">Chickens</a>  come home to roost eventually. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2600.076s">They</a>  do, they just do. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2601.757s">And</a>  we're just gonna have to be ready with that hatchet to chop their heads off and watch them run around. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2611.544s">And</a>  then make wings.</p>

    <p>[nzT0OcLHmhc_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2613.005s">I</a>  also just wanna say really quickly that there are people who have always doubted whether or not we're supposed to be here anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2619.63s">So</a>  there are people who will be like, how are you doing what you're supposed to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2624.073s">It</a>  doesn't even matter that I have the same training, that I have all of the accolades. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2628.696s">You</a>  know, exactly, most likely more, you know, but people will doubt me anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2637.902s">And</a>  so I can't allow that to change me because at the end of the day, you know, I am the granddaughter of, you know, a black woman who never finished, you know, high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2654.233s">So,</a>  and she, <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2657.673s">went</a>  to every, you know, she was always watching all the city council meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2663.517s">The</a>  first time she took me to vote was for a school board election. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2668.12s">I</a>  didn't even know at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2669.501s">I'm</a>  like, what are we voting? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2670.961s">What</a>  are you voting for? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2671.942s">You</a>  know, come on, this is important, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2674.484s">And</a>  I say that to say that <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2676.885s">you</a>  know, my great-grandmom survived many things and was never afraid and always showed up. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2684.128s">And</a>  I think, you know, I learned that from her. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2686.409s">So</a>  I'm gonna keep on showing up. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2690.391s">And</a>  yeah, that's it.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2692.192s">I</a>  love it, I love it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2693.273s">So,</a>  philosophically, you know, you're a museum leader. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2698.895s">You</a>  know, what's your, <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2703.199s">What's</a>  your thought about what a museum is supposed to do and what it's supposed to bring to the people?</p>

    <p>[nzT0OcLHmhc_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2716.443s">So</a>  I think there are lots of different ways that museums can activate communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2727.007s">For</a>  me, I <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2731.748s">think</a>  that, personally, museums <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2738.747s">bear</a>  responsibility to tell the truth. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2741.709s">They</a>  bear responsibility to think about all of the publics that they must engage. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2749.314s">And</a>  more importantly for me, I want the Royal House and Slave Quarters to be a place in which community members can feel like they get to steward the space as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2759.261s">That</a>  they can come and they can reckon with the history. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2762.363s">They</a>  can come and they can feel as though it is their space to <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2769.588s">have</a>  a say in, and more importantly, I think a place where we can really think about the times, we can think about what is impacting our communities the most, and we can strategize together moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2784.658s">And</a>  I think that that's a part of telling the history, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2787.82s">So</a>  you can't come to the royal house and slave quarters and say, man, I learned about the history of slavery, <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2797.426s">And</a>  wow, I'm so, you know, glad that we have moved out of that period in history. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2803.671s">No,</a>  no, no, no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2804.531s">I</a>  want you to go to the museum and say, well, how has the history of slavery still impacted black communities today? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2812.436s">That</a>  is the charge. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2815.038s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2815.378s">It's</a>  not just to know about the history. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2818.34s">It's</a>  also to know about how the legacies of slavery <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2822.94s">still</a>  impact people on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2828.623s">And</a>  for me, once we do that, when we do that, and we allow it to be a space where community members can reckon with that history, and I'm borrowing that from Lonnie Bunch, I think what happens is that <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2847.078s">it</a>  becomes a space that is not only privileged in the sense about who has access to it, but it also becomes a space in which people don't just come on site and feel harmed. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2864.345s">I</a>  want specifically people to come on site and to feel proud. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2870.568s">And</a>  it's not to say that it's not a hard history, because it is a very hard history. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2874.75s">But</a>  while we're talking about all of the violence, I want also people to walk away and say, <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2883.134s">and</a>  my ancestors built this, and they resisted, and they served in the Revolutionary War, and they went and built lives in different communities, and had whole lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2902.803s">I</a>  want people to really think about black people as having a whole world, regardless of whether or not they were enslaved or free. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2910.086s">They</a>  still had families. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2911.727s">they</a>  built lives, they had hopes, they had dreams, they had sorrows, but they had a world. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2921.131s">And</a>  I want people to understand that black people have worlds.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2926.714s">And</a>  in that understanding, <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2930.315s">there's</a>  so much healing that gets derived from that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2933.657s">So</a>  you can come into a space and learn some of the history and feel harmed, but as you exit the space, based on everything that you've learned and everything that you've been made aware of, now it becomes a space of healing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2946.623s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2947.044s">I</a>  love it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2947.624s">I</a>  love it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2948.164s">It's</a>  beautiful. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2951.766s">Do</a>  you feel like you're positioned for future success?</p>

    <p>[nzT0OcLHmhc_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2959.278s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2961.859s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2963.86s">I</a>  think it's a great question actually. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2965.68s">I</a>  do feel like I'm positioned for future success because I have a lot of people who believe in me. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2973.682s">I</a>  have a lot of people who support me. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2977.544s">I</a>  have a lot of people who are committed to catching me if I start to fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2987.49s">And</a>  so for me, I feel like the way that I even define success is to be able to have that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2995.575s">That's</a>  what makes me feel successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=2998.497s">It's</a>  like yes, I do this work and I love this work and I get to talk to people all the time, which I like Yes, but at the end of the day what matters to me the most is that if you call me you might have to call me twice three times I'm gonna answer I'm gonna come through I <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3017.663s">And</a>  I am going to show up for people in the same way that they show up for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3024.831s">Because</a>  we can't do this work without one another. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3027.713s">And</a>  so, yeah.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3030.717s">Yeah,</a>  we're building community and we're gonna build it whether or not people want us to or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3037.628s">So</a>  will you play a little game of word association with me? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3040.891s">Of</a>  course. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3041.131s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3041.351s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3041.832s">So</a>  I'm going to give you a word, and I'm going to ask you to please give me a few sentences on what that word means to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3047.477s">Can</a>  we do that? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3048.357s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3048.678s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3049.058s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3049.618s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3049.899s">So</a>  the first word, and this is as broadly or as narrowly as you want to define it, the first word is community.</p>

    <p>[nzT0OcLHmhc_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3057.065s">Love.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3058.246s">Oh,</a>  wow.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3058.887s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[nzT0OcLHmhc_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3059.467s">All</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[nzT0OcLHmhc_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3063.33s">Necessary.</a> </p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3065.016s">Okay,</a>  all right. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3066.577s">Philanthropy.</a> </p>

    <p>[nzT0OcLHmhc_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3069.2s">Essential.</a> </p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3096.974s">Okay,</a>  okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3098.736s">Especially</a>  right now, surely. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3101.298s">Adversity.</a> </p>

    <p>[nzT0OcLHmhc_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3101.958s">I</a>  would say adversity is, hmm. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3131.232s">Not</a>  a limitation.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3133.214s">Wow.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3134.335s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3135.035s">I</a>  like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3135.756s">I</a>  like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3136.717s">Perspective.</a> </p>

    <p>[nzT0OcLHmhc_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3146.805s">I</a>  would say perspective, what comes to mind is healing.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3156.128s">Okay,</a>  okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3157.388s">Let</a>  me push you a little bit on that one. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3159.57s">When</a>  you say healing, tell me what you mean.</p>

    <p>[nzT0OcLHmhc_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3163.553s">I</a>  think in many ways that sometimes when we can step back and we can have perspective, we can see things more clearly. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3175.04s">And</a>  more importantly, I think just for all of us as individuals, having perspective also means that we give ourselves grace</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3184.588s">I</a>  like that, I like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3187.149s">And</a>  then finally stewardship.</p>

    <p>[nzT0OcLHmhc_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3205.262s">Stewardship</a>  I would say is <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3219.398s">Diversity.</a> </p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3220.999s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3221.98s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3223.041s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3224.522s">Everybody</a>  has to be engaged. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3226.723s">Everybody</a>  gets to play.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3228.144s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3228.765s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3229.585s">And</a>  if we do a little bit, we all get to take a trophy home.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3233.128s">Exactly.</a> </p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3233.488s">You</a>  know, and it's not viewed as a bad thing.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3235.369s">Exactly.</a> </p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3235.95s">Hallelujah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3236.67s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3237.431s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3237.731s">So</a>  five years from now, what will you want the people of Medford to know about the royal house property and your stewardship of that resource?</p>

    <p>[nzT0OcLHmhc_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3246.317s">Oh.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3249.96s">Five</a>  years from now. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3256.635s">I</a>  would say five years from now. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3261.933s">I</a>  would want people to see that the Royal House and Slave Quarters is not just a house museum, but has the potential and is essential to understanding slavery in the North so that it becomes a center that does so. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3288.194s">And</a>  five years from now, I want <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3291.597s">people</a>  to say, more importantly, that I made the space more accessible. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3303.187s">I</a>  made the history more expansive. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3308.432s">And</a>  more importantly, I made them proud.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3314.313s">Alright,</a>  alright. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3315.914s">Okay,</a>  alright, so this maybe takes a little bit of the pressure off you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3320.477s">I</a>  know I've been a little bit rough on you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3323.399s">But</a>  you, of all resources in Medford to me right now, are sitting on, you know, one of the true gold mines that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3338.229s">So</a>  I, you know, I was, when I thought about sitting down and talking with you, I said, you know, I can't left Kiara off easy. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3346.092s">You</a>  know, I'm gonna have to, we're gonna have to grill some fish on this one. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3349.713s">All</a>  right, let's do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3350.713s">So</a>  it's all right. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3351.554s">Okay,</a>  so. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3352.074s">I</a>  look snapper. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3353.034s">Oh,</a>  red snapper? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3354.535s">Yeah,</a>  you Caribbean, Caribbean girl, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3357.476s">Red</a>  snapper. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3359.376s">What</a>  would people who are just meeting you for the first time be surprised to learn about you? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3364.343s">Oh,</a>  that's a good question.</p>

    <p>[nzT0OcLHmhc_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3365.545s">I</a>  don't know, actually. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3368.029s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3376.607s">Probably</a>  that I'm a little, I'm a little shy. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3381.451s">I</a>  think I am so much in the public that I talk all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3393.88s">But</a>  actually, people are quite surprised that if I walk into a space, I will most likely hang out in the back. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3401.926s">I</a>  always work up the courage to go do the thing, but initially, you know, it's okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3408.61s">It's</a>  okay.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3409.511s">I'm</a>  a little reserved. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3411.492s">Well,</a>  I'm a little reserved. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3413.293s">Listen,</a>  you gotta let the introvert in you get out sometimes. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3416.996s">That</a>  I am not.</p>

    <p>[nzT0OcLHmhc_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3421.118s">Unfortunately.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3422.699s">I'm</a>  quite an extrovert, but I'm a reserved extrovert.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3427.2s">It's</a>  an interesting dichotomy.</p>

    <p>[nzT0OcLHmhc_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3429.001s">Yeah,</a>  I think that's probably it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3432.882s">But</a>  yeah, I think it's a little thing.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3435.682s">All</a>  right, so it's only fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3438.243s">I've</a>  taken some shots to give you an opportunity to take a shot at me. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3444.584s">What</a>  shots do I have to take? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3446.485s">Any</a>  question you think you might want to ask, you can do it.</p>

    <p>[nzT0OcLHmhc_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3451.707s">Um,</a>  I guess I don't have any shots to take.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3455.41s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[nzT0OcLHmhc_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3455.65s">That's</a>  wild. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3457.271s">Um,</a>  but I, I do have a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3459.692s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3460.993s">Um,</a>  given your illustrious career as a poet.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3469.139s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3470.179s">I'm</a>  just going to take the compliment. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3471.82s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3472.141s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3472.581s">Um,</a> </p>

    <p>[nzT0OcLHmhc_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3475.804s">How</a>  do you think we can use literature to respond to these times?</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3482.951s">It's</a>  funny because it kind of dovetails and takes me back to that moment that I had where I was feeling kind of a little bit scared about some of the things that I might say and how those things might be interpreted by folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3499.948s">But</a>  I think that my duty, and it's actually biblical, it comes from Habakkuk 2 and 2, and it says, write these things down so that a herald can run with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3514.758s">So</a>  I may not be the person that runs with it, but I have to be the person that writes it down. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3521.603s">And</a>  the other thing is that if there's a generation of poets coming up after me, and they see that I'm scared to say the things that I think I need to say, then they might be scared to say the things that they need to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3534.235s">So</a>  I've got to be, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3537.517s">I've</a>  got to have the courage of my literary convictions. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3542.38s">And</a>  I've got to be able to tell the truth and shame the devils. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3546.762s">Because</a>  there's a lot of devils right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3550.604s">And</a>  if we cower in fear and we don't strike back at those that are striking at us, then we lose. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3562.81s">We</a>  can't possibly win if we're not willing to fight. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3566.972s">And</a>  now, I'm not a fighter fighter. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3570.114s">I'm</a>  a pacifist by nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3577.267s">But</a>  I'm a pacifist with a big mouth. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3581.308s">So</a>  I've got something to say, and I can say it reasonably eloquently through my poetry. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3587.55s">So</a>  that's what I'm going to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3590.791s">And</a>  if it ends up being the thing that makes folks who are out there looking for folks that are doing subversive things, I'm just going to have to deal with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3600.674s">I'm</a>  just going to have to deal with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3604.715s">I'm</a>  going to give you the last word. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3605.896s">What</a>  are your parting thoughts?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3607.389s">Hmm.</a> </p>

    <p>[nzT0OcLHmhc_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3618.494s">I've</a>  been reading a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3619.754s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3624.817s">And</a>  I want to share a quote from Octavia Butler.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3635.241s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3642.192s">that</a>  I've been sitting with. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3653.794s">Let's</a>  see if I can find it.</p>

    <p>[nzT0OcLHmhc_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3664.396s">So</a>  Octavia Butler has an essay in which she says, <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3671.02s">So</a>  why try to predict the future at all if it's so difficult, so nearly impossible? <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3676.321s">Because</a>  making predictions is one way to give warning when we see ourselves drifting in dangerous directions. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3682.742s">Because</a>  prediction is a useful way of pointing out safer, wiser courses. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3687.483s">Because</a>  most of all, our tomorrow is the child of our day. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3691.424s">Through</a>  thought and deed, we exert a great deal of influence over this child, even though we can't control it absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3698.145s">Best</a>  to think about it, though. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3699.927s">Best</a>  to try to shape it into something good. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3702.85s">Best</a>  to do that for any child. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3706.034s">And</a>  I think in thinking about where we are today and the reason why we have to continue to do the work is that, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3720.886s">as</a>  Octavia Butler says, that we should be doing that anyway and for everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3726.871s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3728.452s">And</a>  so I think my last parting words would be, <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3737.549s">There's</a>  a lot to be afraid of. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3739.55s">A</a>  lot of people have a lot of things on the line. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3743.912s">And</a>  I think if we remember that we are all in community with one another. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3753.162s">I</a>  think it'll help everyone feel as though they can live their most true and authentic life because we got one another. <a href="https://youtu.be/2dmRw3Tp0tA&t=3763.753s">And</a>  so, that's where I'll end.</p>
