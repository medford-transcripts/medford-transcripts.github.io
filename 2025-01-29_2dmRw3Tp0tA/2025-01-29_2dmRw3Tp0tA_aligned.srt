1
00:00:00,471 --> 00:00:04,132
You know where the last time... You know where the last time...

2
00:00:28,077 --> 00:00:28,237
Okay.

3
00:00:28,297 --> 00:00:28,377
Okay.

4
00:00:47,951 --> 00:00:49,472
Nice to see you.

5
00:00:49,573 --> 00:00:51,134
Oh, thank you.

6
00:00:51,254 --> 00:00:52,615
Oh, nice to have you all.

7
00:00:52,655 --> 00:00:53,856
Yeah, great to see you.

8
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:18,061
Hi, Kim.

9
00:01:18,301 --> 00:01:18,641
Hi.

10
00:01:19,802 --> 00:01:21,804
Hi, Laura.

11
00:01:21,884 --> 00:01:22,325
Hi, Laura.

12
00:01:22,345 --> 00:01:23,225
Good to see you.

13
00:01:23,265 --> 00:01:24,827
Good to see you.

14
00:01:24,947 --> 00:01:26,889
What's that?

15
00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:36,057
I said you walked right by it like you didn't know it.

16
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:39,740
I said you walked by it like you didn't know it.

17
00:01:44,377 --> 00:01:46,358
Yeah, she's doing pretty good.

18
00:01:46,418 --> 00:01:47,338
Happy New Year.

19
00:02:14,778 --> 00:02:15,399
We are here.

20
00:02:15,459 --> 00:02:16,400
You were in my ear.

21
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,083
I was like, you know we're in Italy, and where else?

22
00:02:19,224 --> 00:02:20,545
I know, but where am I?

23
00:02:20,685 --> 00:02:24,270
I'm in Italy, that's what I saw on Facebook.

24
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:35,959
I'm glad you're here.

25
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:37,440
Of course, the library.

26
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:37,740
Yeah.

27
00:03:00,836 --> 00:03:01,797
And then his own wife.

28
00:03:02,537 --> 00:03:03,958
He's in his area.

29
00:03:04,138 --> 00:03:05,039
Oh, yeah.

30
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:06,580
His wife is.

31
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,560
So she does, too.

32
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:12,103
She does the housekeeping.

33
00:03:12,123 --> 00:03:13,464
I love you so much.

34
00:03:13,584 --> 00:03:14,724
I love you so much.

35
00:03:14,845 --> 00:03:15,225
I miss you.

36
00:03:15,285 --> 00:03:15,745
I love you.

37
00:03:15,845 --> 00:03:16,986
I didn't miss you.

38
00:03:17,226 --> 00:03:19,027
You should have a great time.

39
00:03:19,167 --> 00:03:21,128
I could watch it.

40
00:03:21,148 --> 00:03:21,749
I could watch it.

41
00:03:28,092 --> 00:03:29,614
Thank you very much.

42
00:03:51,192 --> 00:03:52,714
You love a good concert.

43
00:04:09,743 --> 00:04:11,745
Did you know that before?

44
00:04:11,805 --> 00:04:13,066
I did not know.

45
00:04:13,266 --> 00:04:13,727
You won't.

46
00:04:36,468 --> 00:04:37,088
Yeah.

47
00:04:37,149 --> 00:04:37,609
Yeah.

48
00:04:52,925 --> 00:04:54,066
I don't know.

49
00:05:19,992 --> 00:05:23,274
I'm going to have you on this side.

50
00:05:23,294 --> 00:05:25,255
Watch out for any cables.

51
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:41,230
th th

52
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:09,233
That looks good, Mark.

53
00:06:18,395 --> 00:06:24,860
Mark can you actually just pan that shot to the right a tiny bit so we don't lose Terry.

54
00:06:37,709 --> 00:06:39,569
Yeah, that's good, that's good right there.

55
00:07:19,485 --> 00:07:21,365
Well, good evening, friends and neighbors.

56
00:07:21,405 --> 00:07:28,726
My name is Terry E. Cotter, and I direct Elder Services here at our beloved West Medford Community Center.

57
00:07:29,266 --> 00:07:37,328
Welcome to another live monthly presentation of Fresh Fridays, Words, and Music, rebranded

58
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:39,963
Cobb and Sanders for February.

59
00:07:40,023 --> 00:07:41,263
It's Black History Month.

60
00:07:41,884 --> 00:07:47,726
We're happy to be with you tonight, following up our epic Martin Luther King Jr.

61
00:07:47,766 --> 00:07:49,207
Day celebration at St.

62
00:07:49,287 --> 00:07:56,870
Rayfield's Paris Center in January, and getting back to our culture-keeping duties here at 111 Arlington Street.

63
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:07,414
Thanks as always to the assistance of the Medford Arts Council, a member of the Massachusetts Cultural Council for help with funding this program.

64
00:08:11,579 --> 00:08:13,162
And it definitely is starting to do that now.

65
00:08:13,182 --> 00:08:18,709
We want to remind you that COVID and RSV and a bunch of new flus are out there.

66
00:08:19,689 --> 00:08:23,871
We're still trying to be mindful of local health requirements and concerns.

67
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:26,912
Masking is welcome, but it's not required.

68
00:08:27,292 --> 00:08:30,474
As always, we're just happy to have you in the building.

69
00:08:30,494 --> 00:08:33,715
We're happy to be here sponsoring live programming.

70
00:08:33,996 --> 00:08:38,418
And we're glad to see our neighbors, our friends, and supporters coming through the doors.

71
00:08:38,878 --> 00:08:40,759
Thank you so much for being here.

72
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:59,750
Thanks also to our other event partner, Kevin Harrington and Medford Community Media for consistently guiding us as we broadcast you via Medford Community Media, channels 9 for Comcast and 47 for Verizon, as well as on MCM YouTube.

73
00:09:01,311 --> 00:09:07,695
If you're out there watching the show on your electronic devices or your television, welcome to the show.

74
00:09:09,156 --> 00:09:24,784
So before we get to the main business for the evening, we do want to extend community condolences to the families of Charlie Paris and Ruth Youngblood, two dear friends of the center and great civic-minded citizens of the city of Medford.

75
00:09:25,364 --> 00:09:37,091
Their recent losses represent huge tears in the fabric of this neighborhood, and they are both remembered with respect and fondness by all of us here at WMCC.

76
00:09:38,812 --> 00:09:54,255
So in my travels as a poet and something of an ambassador for the arts here in Medford, I've been privileged to encounter some tremendous teachers, leaders, and history makers across a wide panorama of human endeavor.

77
00:09:54,655 --> 00:09:59,696
Words and Music has given me the great opportunity to bring a lot of those folks to your attention.

78
00:10:00,136 --> 00:10:07,538
Tonight is no exception, so I hope you're ready for all things insightful and delightful.

79
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:08,538
Can't help it.

80
00:10:08,819 --> 00:10:09,639
I just can't help it.

81
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:21,187
So our guest for this portion of the evening's program is not new to Medford, but she continues to make a significant and positive impression on everyone who has crossed her path.

82
00:10:21,667 --> 00:10:29,032
She is the executive director of the historic Royal House and Slave Quarters right off of Main Street just beyond Medford Square.

83
00:10:29,632 --> 00:10:43,620
Now the Royal House and Slave Quarters, the former family estate of Isaac Royal, is recognized as a living, breathing reflection of history and existence of a slave quarters and legal slavery in Massachusetts.

84
00:10:44,141 --> 00:10:54,507
It is a national historical landmark, now operated as a non-profit museum, and open for public visits between June 1st and the last weekend in October.

85
00:10:55,147 --> 00:11:04,298
Please allow me to introduce to some and reacquaint with others the head chef of all that's cooking at RHSQ, Dr. Kiara Singleton.

86
00:11:09,059 --> 00:11:11,441
Okay, now this is going to take just a minute to unpack.

87
00:11:12,302 --> 00:11:19,788
Kiara holds a PhD, earned PhD, from the University of Michigan Ann Arbor in the Department of American Culture.

88
00:11:20,329 --> 00:11:27,775
She is also a postdoctoral fellow for the Slavery, Colonialism, and Their Legacies Project at Tufts University.

89
00:11:28,336 --> 00:11:33,901
Between 2021 and 2023, Kiara Singleton was an American Democracy fellow

90
00:11:34,441 --> 00:11:43,464
in the Charles Warren Center at Harvard University, and she has held a number of prestigious academic fellowships.

91
00:11:44,344 --> 00:11:51,366
As a public history scholar, Kiara is one of the co-curators of the Boston Slavery Exhibit at Faneuil Hall.

92
00:11:51,787 --> 00:12:02,050
She was a member of the Table of Voices cohort at the Museum of Fine Arts Boston for the Hear Me Now exhibit, the Black Partisans of Old Edgefield, South Carolina.

93
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:14,278
She has been appointed to serve on the City of Boston's Commemoration Commission and the Special Commission on the 250th anniversary of the American Revolution for Massachusetts.

94
00:12:14,918 --> 00:12:19,901
Her accolades have really, really piled up in recent years.

95
00:12:20,381 --> 00:12:30,348
There are really too many to mention, but in October of 2023, she received a Women of Courage and Conviction Award from the National Council

96
00:12:30,928 --> 00:12:38,750
of Negro women in an official citation from the Massachusetts State Senate for her work in documenting the history of slavery.

97
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:47,832
She is a board member for Mass Humanities and serves on the advisory team for Just Flicks, a youth-focused storytelling organization in Medford.

98
00:12:48,452 --> 00:12:59,915
Kiara is also a member of the Board of Public Humanities Fellows at Brown University, which brings together a collection of museum leaders from Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Connecticut.

99
00:13:00,935 --> 00:13:18,879
She has reestablished the Royal House and Slave Quarters prominence as the only remaining such structure in the Northeast and has worked tirelessly, along with a dedicated board and a small army of volunteers and supporters, to advance the relevance of this special history throughout New England.

100
00:13:19,439 --> 00:13:27,661
With seasonal tours and educational programs throughout the year, the museum is one of Medford's true historical treasures.

101
00:13:28,081 --> 00:13:30,522
Again, please welcome Dr. Kiara Singleton.

102
00:13:30,622 --> 00:13:30,689
you

103
00:13:36,135 --> 00:13:38,537
I need to make an abbreviated bio.

104
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:43,762
I abbreviated the one you sent me.

105
00:13:43,882 --> 00:13:44,863
I'm serious, Carrie.

106
00:13:44,903 --> 00:13:49,127
I mean, you're shaking and moving all over the historical landscape.

107
00:13:49,207 --> 00:13:52,450
So yeah, I'm happy to be able to share it.

108
00:13:52,990 --> 00:14:02,238
So as is my custom in hosting these evenings, and I hope you'll bear with me, I'd like to share a bit of verse to help shape the evening.

109
00:14:02,899 --> 00:14:08,961
You know by now that I believe that poetry should be, above all things, accessible and inclusive.

110
00:14:09,581 --> 00:14:16,542
Sometimes, like the times we're in right now, it also has to have a little bite to it.

111
00:14:17,283 --> 00:14:20,063
This piece is called We Earned It.

112
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:30,086
A song poet said, no less than the rocks and the trees, we have a right to be here.

113
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:37,979
You want to find corners, cells, closets, fences, borders, and barriers to close us in or shut us out.

114
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:44,482
Study the history, the real history, not the sugar-coated, sanitized, or whitewashed.

115
00:14:45,242 --> 00:14:50,825
The Middle Passage wasn't a picnic, a pleasure trip, a sacred crusade, or a pastoral visit.

116
00:14:51,746 --> 00:15:05,919
We were kidnapped, hijacked, and in a word, stolen from our sheltering sun, our greener fields, our shady groves, our spiritual pantheons, our melanated diversity, and our cultural divinity.

117
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:16,649
Doors and gates of no return lapped at the frigid waters of our disconnection from the lands, laws, lords, and villages of our native birth.

118
00:15:17,551 --> 00:15:30,597
Foreign invaders took our kindness for weakness, took our curiosity for acquiescence, took our culture and our art, our music, our treasured symbols, and our native creativity by force when necessary.

119
00:15:31,257 --> 00:15:33,118
And they always thought it was necessary.

120
00:15:34,038 --> 00:15:57,588
Confined to cabin and field, quartered and squalor, hired by North Carolina tobacco bonds, Florida cane breaks, Mississippi mudflats, Alabama cotton kingdoms and Virginia plantation subjugation, beaten but never broken, chained but never conquered, bloody but unbowed, ravaged, reviled, and raped, but resolute and revolutionary.

121
00:15:58,368 --> 00:15:59,629
We know you don't want to hear it.

122
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:01,852
White fragility is a real thing.

123
00:16:02,352 --> 00:16:05,536
Erasure and elimination is a love language for you right now.

124
00:16:06,216 --> 00:16:06,957
Nothing new to us.

125
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:08,219
We've been here before.

126
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,805
Our freedom has never been gladly awarded, graciously given, or peacefully conceded.

127
00:16:14,447 --> 00:16:20,092
There has always been a war that rages of the head, the heart, the body, and the spirit.

128
00:16:20,332 --> 00:16:25,477
Always been battlefields, burial sites, scorched earth, and secret societies.

129
00:16:25,998 --> 00:16:33,644
There have always been Confederate aspirations, supremacist machinations, violent perpetrations, and terrorist preparations.

130
00:16:34,501 --> 00:16:36,742
We've always made a way out of no way.

131
00:16:37,482 --> 00:16:40,563
We are not a people of constant need and pauper's greed.

132
00:16:40,603 --> 00:16:44,284
We are not a people of government subsidy and happy poverty.

133
00:16:44,644 --> 00:16:48,745
We are not a people of locusts, land grants, and entitlements.

134
00:16:48,825 --> 00:16:52,966
We are not freeloaders, panhandlers, beggars, or vagrants.

135
00:16:53,486 --> 00:16:57,067
We have glory and pride, and we're dignified.

136
00:16:57,627 --> 00:16:59,188
We are overcomers.

137
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:02,551
We are the victory over American apartheid.

138
00:17:02,912 --> 00:17:07,257
We are the straw that broke the back of chattel slavery and colonial domination.

139
00:17:07,697 --> 00:17:11,982
We are not a footnote, a parenthetical expression, or an asterisk.

140
00:17:12,462 --> 00:17:15,766
We are creative genius and collective wisdom.

141
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:19,090
We are athletic prowess and aesthetic brilliance.

142
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:22,471
We are civic engagement and political action.

143
00:17:22,851 --> 00:17:27,512
We are military leadership, courage under fire, and valorous service.

144
00:17:27,932 --> 00:17:31,414
We are builders, engineers, contractors, and surveyors.

145
00:17:31,794 --> 00:17:34,134
We are teachers, trainers, and trendsetters.

146
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:37,815
We are history makers, curse breakers, and territory takers.

147
00:17:38,156 --> 00:17:40,156
We are healers, heralds, and heroes.

148
00:17:40,516 --> 00:17:42,997
We are heroines, homemakers, and humanitarians.

149
00:17:43,397 --> 00:17:45,840
We are prophets, preachers, and philanthropists.

150
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:50,204
We are comedians, filmmakers, and risk takers.

151
00:17:50,545 --> 00:17:53,568
We are researchers, detectives, and discoverers.

152
00:17:53,928 --> 00:18:00,275
We are the straw that stirs the drink, breaks the camel's back, and makes the best bricks.

153
00:18:01,016 --> 00:18:02,358
We have earned it.

154
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:06,160
We inherited little other than our good names and righteous faith.

155
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:11,403
We have not easily acquired generational wealth based on labors other than our own.

156
00:18:11,804 --> 00:18:23,171
We have not been repaid, reimbursed, repaired, or made whole for the myriad of sins this republic has committed against us in pursuit of its own life, liberty, and happiness.

157
00:18:24,031 --> 00:18:30,434
Our hope and expectation is that God sees us and knows that we are called according to his purpose.

158
00:18:31,014 --> 00:18:33,435
Therein lies our future glory.

159
00:18:33,816 --> 00:18:35,736
Here endeth the poet's story.

160
00:18:40,899 --> 00:18:41,339
Thank you.

161
00:18:42,479 --> 00:18:42,920
Thank you.

162
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,661
So that's how we're going to move.

163
00:18:47,182 --> 00:18:50,043
Now let's have a friendly chat with Dr. Kara Singleton.

164
00:18:51,712 --> 00:18:53,594
Okay, so Kira, you're not from New England.

165
00:18:54,094 --> 00:18:54,815
No, I am not.

166
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:57,698
No, tell us a bit about how you got here and why you stayed.

167
00:18:57,898 --> 00:19:02,202
Yeah, so although I'm not from, well first, thank you so much for having me.

168
00:19:02,282 --> 00:19:07,488
It's always a pleasure to be in conversation with you and also to be at the West Medford Community Center.

169
00:19:09,428 --> 00:19:12,049
I am originally from Camden, New Jersey.

170
00:19:13,089 --> 00:19:19,110
So if anyone knows where Camden, New Jersey is, it's right across from Philadelphia.

171
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:24,051
Literally, it's separated by the Ben Franklin Bridge.

172
00:19:24,071 --> 00:19:34,093
I grew up there and I went off to college and I went to Minnesota for college, a small school called McAllister.

173
00:19:34,633 --> 00:19:37,294
And there, I really, really, really

174
00:19:40,355 --> 00:19:42,916
decided that my passion was to study slavery.

175
00:19:45,397 --> 00:20:04,724
And from there I went to grad school, from grad school I ended up here and I think it's really been perfect in many ways because not only do I get to write about the history of slavery, something that I love learning about and talking about,

176
00:20:05,184 --> 00:20:10,506
But also my job is to do it every single day.

177
00:20:10,866 --> 00:20:12,707
And for some people, that can be a little overwhelming.

178
00:20:12,747 --> 00:20:15,448
They're like, you really want to talk about slavery every day?

179
00:20:15,808 --> 00:20:17,409
And I'm like, I know, I understand.

180
00:20:17,809 --> 00:20:26,973
But I think for me, so much about understanding our past is also about understanding our current moment and imagining what a future could be.

181
00:20:27,053 --> 00:20:30,895
So I like to think of it as an entryway to also knowing ourselves.

182
00:20:30,915 --> 00:20:32,916
OK, OK, perfect, perfect.

183
00:20:35,803 --> 00:20:38,904
What, if anything, did you know about Medford?

184
00:20:39,385 --> 00:20:46,708
And can you talk a little bit about being courted by the Royal House Board and becoming the current executive director?

185
00:20:48,062 --> 00:21:06,366
So it's actually a really interesting and funny story that in so many ways, the royal house and slave quarters, I don't know how to describe it other than my first time in Boston.

186
00:21:06,946 --> 00:21:09,586
My very first time in Boston was in 2019.

187
00:21:10,087 --> 00:21:16,768
I came for a conference at Harvard, and that was because my advisor left Michigan, came to Harvard,

188
00:21:17,348 --> 00:21:21,151
I was living in Atlanta, not necessarily working on my dissertation as much as I should have been.

189
00:21:22,091 --> 00:21:30,037
And she called me one day and she said, you know, you know, I went to graduate school straight out of undergrad, too.

190
00:21:30,057 --> 00:21:31,278
So I was like all over the place.

191
00:21:31,298 --> 00:21:36,121
She said, you know, I always said I would let you wander and then I will pull you back.

192
00:21:36,802 --> 00:21:38,023
It's time to finish.

193
00:21:38,563 --> 00:21:41,025
And I was like, do I have to leave Atlanta to do that?

194
00:21:41,145 --> 00:21:43,186
And she said, do you have funding in Atlanta?

195
00:21:43,226 --> 00:21:43,927
And I said, you're right.

196
00:21:46,108 --> 00:22:06,962
said you're gonna come on over to Massachusetts because that's where I'm at and that's where you have funding so I said all right so I came and I was like all right let me see let me imagine my life here the conference was at Harvard so I came to check it out and actually a professor at Tufts was giving the keynote and she started talking about the royal house and slave quarters and she's like you know

197
00:22:07,502 --> 00:22:10,283
there's a slave quarters in the north.

198
00:22:10,343 --> 00:22:11,264
And I was like, no, there's not.

199
00:22:11,484 --> 00:22:12,124
I study slavery.

200
00:22:12,144 --> 00:22:12,704
I would know that.

201
00:22:13,084 --> 00:22:14,105
I'm from New Jersey.

202
00:22:14,185 --> 00:22:14,865
I would know that.

203
00:22:15,225 --> 00:22:18,967
So I pull out my phone because I'm Googling it and I'm like, why didn't I know this?

204
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:23,128
And so I had all of my friends who were at the conference with me.

205
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:31,532
We went and we took a tour and we just stayed in the meeting room afterwards and we talked and I never forgot about it.

206
00:22:32,492 --> 00:22:33,373
And then a year later,

207
00:22:34,502 --> 00:22:42,787
the job posting came up, and that same advisor who told me it was time to finish my dissertation sent it to me and said, I think you would like this.

208
00:22:43,988 --> 00:22:46,030
And I applied, and I got it.

209
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:49,492
And I mean, honestly, in so many ways, it feels like it's fate.

210
00:22:49,612 --> 00:22:51,113
I love my job.

211
00:22:51,133 --> 00:22:52,294
I have a really cool job.

212
00:22:53,795 --> 00:22:59,919
And at the same time, I felt like from that moment that I encountered it, I was never able to stop thinking about it.

213
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,721
I don't know if they courted me or if I courted them, actually.

214
00:23:04,821 --> 00:23:05,381
OK.

215
00:23:05,501 --> 00:23:05,821
All right.

216
00:23:05,841 --> 00:23:06,121
All right.

217
00:23:06,141 --> 00:23:14,703
Well, that's interesting because, you know, and I've asked this question before when I've had, you know, another person sitting in the seat that you're sitting now.

218
00:23:15,743 --> 00:23:26,966
Do you think that there was anything significant that, you know, that the hiring committee was looking for that made you like a preferred candidate?

219
00:23:27,006 --> 00:23:31,727
I mean, what did they see in you that they maybe didn't see in anybody else that they were talking to?

220
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:36,268
I can give the non-political answer.

221
00:23:37,289 --> 00:23:39,650
This is a political crowd.

222
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:41,650
You can go with the political answer for these folks.

223
00:23:43,731 --> 00:23:44,771
So it's a great question.

224
00:23:44,851 --> 00:23:46,872
I think there are a few different things.

225
00:23:48,072 --> 00:23:49,853
One, I came in as a scholar.

226
00:23:51,214 --> 00:23:59,502
And so coming in with the background meant that already there was going to be a different type of engagement with the space for me.

227
00:24:00,563 --> 00:24:09,472
In the sense that, you know, I came in and I looked around and I, you know, I went on the tour, I heard the history, and immediately I started thinking about, this is amazing.

228
00:24:10,032 --> 00:24:10,953
What else can we do?

229
00:24:11,073 --> 00:24:13,154
How can we expand the narrative?

230
00:24:13,194 --> 00:24:15,756
How can we do more research?

231
00:24:16,497 --> 00:24:19,859
So I would like to say that my enthusiasm was one of it.

232
00:24:19,899 --> 00:24:21,881
My training was another.

233
00:24:21,901 --> 00:24:30,026
I think the other part of that is also that I am the first black woman to lead the museum.

234
00:24:31,047 --> 00:24:37,611
And so on top of all of my training, on top of my vision,

235
00:24:38,432 --> 00:24:43,235
you know, it doesn't hurt, you know, to and I'm very proud of that.

236
00:24:43,335 --> 00:24:43,555
Right.

237
00:24:43,615 --> 00:24:57,963
To say that, you know, I can come in and not only talk about this history because it's important, but I can also talk about this history as a descendant of, you know, enslaved people.

238
00:24:58,583 --> 00:25:02,605
You know, you know, so it's it's it you know, I felt like it it felt perfect.

239
00:25:02,685 --> 00:25:05,387
And for me, it also felt perfect to also

240
00:25:06,007 --> 00:25:09,528
step outside and be really honest about why I do that work.

241
00:25:09,868 --> 00:25:12,229
Yes, I do the work because I love history.

242
00:25:12,609 --> 00:25:18,411
The other reason why I do that work is because I also learn about my family history.

243
00:25:18,912 --> 00:25:21,653
I love helping other people learn about their family history.

244
00:25:21,673 --> 00:25:22,453
I love

245
00:25:23,073 --> 00:25:31,575
people understanding how integral black people were to the building of this country, the skills that we had.

246
00:25:31,915 --> 00:25:40,958
You know, for me it's a point of pride to be able to talk about this history and also to help other people feel and have some pride about it as well.

247
00:25:41,318 --> 00:25:43,659
I love it, I love it, very good, very good.

248
00:25:43,699 --> 00:25:48,740
So now you, you came from, you went from

249
00:25:51,118 --> 00:25:55,702
McAllister to Atlanta to Michigan to Michigan.

250
00:25:55,782 --> 00:25:57,823
OK, then to Atlanta.

251
00:25:57,883 --> 00:25:58,204
Yeah.

252
00:25:58,424 --> 00:25:59,445
OK.

253
00:26:00,445 --> 00:26:03,528
First Jersey, obviously, and then up to Boston.

254
00:26:04,168 --> 00:26:08,272
OK, so Boston is clearly different from all of those places.

255
00:26:09,433 --> 00:26:23,556
What has it been about this area that has been engaging to you and then what is it that has been most challenging in terms of the other places that you've been and maybe loved a little bit?

256
00:26:23,948 --> 00:26:24,388
Yeah.

257
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:31,473
OK, so I'm a part of the very weird few people when people say, do you like it?

258
00:26:31,533 --> 00:26:32,354
I'm like, yes, I do.

259
00:26:35,436 --> 00:26:38,558
And I always have to, like, brace for people to be like, really?

260
00:26:40,039 --> 00:26:40,659
But it's OK.

261
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:41,460
It's now a thing.

262
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,782
It's a joke amongst my friends.

263
00:26:43,862 --> 00:26:46,844
Everyone's going to be like, uh, Kiara's going to talk about how much she likes Boston.

264
00:26:47,924 --> 00:26:50,086
But I think there are a few reasons why I like it.

265
00:26:50,206 --> 00:26:53,948
I think one I'm close to home I left to go to college when I was 18.

266
00:26:54,088 --> 00:27:00,832
I spent most of my time not being close to home actually And so there's something very special about that.

267
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:02,993
You know, I'm from you know, I

268
00:27:03,733 --> 00:27:06,636
the East Coast like, you know, I know how to get around.

269
00:27:06,696 --> 00:27:07,877
It feels comfortable to me.

270
00:27:07,897 --> 00:27:12,601
I think the other part of it is that this place is full of history.

271
00:27:14,362 --> 00:27:18,126
And I can't imagine doing the work that I do anywhere else.

272
00:27:18,166 --> 00:27:25,913
It's not to say that I couldn't, but literally you walk the streets and you just understand how historical it is.

273
00:27:26,153 --> 00:27:27,034
And more importantly,

274
00:27:29,056 --> 00:27:42,415
how many communities have been working to preserve their history and they were doing it on their own before it became the hottest thing to study right now in Massachusetts, which is slavery.

275
00:27:43,415 --> 00:27:49,596
And so I think I've learned a lot from community members who have told me, oh, go look at this archive.

276
00:27:50,197 --> 00:27:51,297
Have you heard about this?

277
00:27:51,497 --> 00:27:55,038
Or I want you to do this or here's this thing that I've saved.

278
00:27:55,878 --> 00:27:58,558
To me, I felt very welcomed.

279
00:27:59,038 --> 00:28:06,760
And it felt like I was, it feels like I'm here doing what I'm supposed to do and doing it in community and for community.

280
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:11,423
I think what's challenging about it is that Boston is not Atlanta.

281
00:28:11,443 --> 00:28:15,286
No, it's not a Mecca.

282
00:28:15,467 --> 00:28:20,831
And so I think sometimes a part of when people go, you really like it here?

283
00:28:20,971 --> 00:28:23,473
Is that because they don't see many people who look like us.

284
00:28:24,133 --> 00:28:29,638
But I am not a person who is going to take that as fact.

285
00:28:29,998 --> 00:28:33,881
So a part of what I have done is I've been like, all right, where are the black people?

286
00:28:33,921 --> 00:28:34,682
I'm going to go find them.

287
00:28:35,222 --> 00:28:35,722
And guess what?

288
00:28:35,882 --> 00:28:36,522
I have found them.

289
00:28:37,683 --> 00:28:49,927
So it does take a little getting out of, you know, specifically that Harvard Cambridge bubble and going to places and, you know, showing up, like going and, you know, meeting people.

290
00:28:50,067 --> 00:28:52,548
And because I've done that, I've built a really nice community.

291
00:28:52,628 --> 00:29:01,791
And so for me, I think a part of, you know, I understand why this is a very challenging place, that it's very clear to me.

292
00:29:02,771 --> 00:29:10,418
And at the same time, it has had a historic black community since the, you know, 17th, 18th century.

293
00:29:11,639 --> 00:29:12,760
And we're here.

294
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,581
You just gotta you just gotta find the people.

295
00:29:14,721 --> 00:29:15,122
That's it.

296
00:29:15,282 --> 00:29:15,682
That's it.

297
00:29:15,902 --> 00:29:16,463
Very good.

298
00:29:16,643 --> 00:29:17,083
Very good.

299
00:29:17,103 --> 00:29:17,644
So.

300
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:27,085
We're in a, you know, and I said it before, I'll say it again, we're in kind of a challenging place right now, historically.

301
00:29:28,026 --> 00:29:33,590
How have the last few years kind of gotten you ready for the next few and beyond that?

302
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:37,172
Oh, that's a really good question and a hard question.

303
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,962
I guess I would answer it like,

304
00:29:52,297 --> 00:29:56,155
I'm not even sure it's just been the last few years, you know, I think.

305
00:30:00,103 --> 00:30:06,387
we've been seeing so much happen in the country.

306
00:30:06,927 --> 00:30:25,779
I think that there's something to be said about seeing the spirit of how people organize, how they rush into the streets, how they demand justice, how we speak back, knowing that there are gonna be consequences to that, but you do it anyway.

307
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:48,379
And so for me, I think I have been really held and inspired by the many activists, whether we're talking about George Floyd, whether we're talking about Palestine, whether we're talking about speaking back against a repressive government right now, people who have

308
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:59,113
always been fighting and remind us that historically, you know, we have to organize in order to win.

309
00:30:59,193 --> 00:30:59,854
And so I think

310
00:31:01,049 --> 00:31:05,110
for me, the next few years is all about learning.

311
00:31:05,371 --> 00:31:09,512
I mean, right now, my moment is about learning in order to make it to the next few years.

312
00:31:09,932 --> 00:31:18,175
And to remember that there have been people who have been living through all types of things.

313
00:31:18,875 --> 00:31:20,996
And they have been coming up with strategies.

314
00:31:21,036 --> 00:31:23,757
And I like to say that at this moment, it's not a time

315
00:31:24,357 --> 00:31:27,478
to feel hopeless.

316
00:31:27,938 --> 00:31:41,562
In fact, it's a time for us to learn from the reproductive justice workers in Mississippi, who for them, it has always been challenging to have reproductive care.

317
00:31:41,602 --> 00:31:49,665
So they've always had to take care of one another and create systems in order to take care of people.

318
00:31:51,045 --> 00:32:04,088
we can look to fast food workers who are striking all throughout the country for a better and higher wage, despite the type of violence and retaliation that they were being met with.

319
00:32:04,508 --> 00:32:09,529
And so again, there have been people who have been organizing, and they've been surviving.

320
00:32:09,669 --> 00:32:17,311
And I think if we also look to Europe and think through the rise of different fascist governments there since 2010, 2011,

321
00:32:21,693 --> 00:32:25,075
you also see that they haven't quite taken over.

322
00:32:25,215 --> 00:32:40,986
So it's a reminder that there are people in this country and across the world who have been fighting these battles as well, and I think we should be learning from them and with them in order to resist and to keep going.

323
00:32:41,266 --> 00:32:45,469
Absolutely, and at the risk of quoting history to a historian,

324
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:48,971
the Civil Rights Movement never ended.

325
00:32:50,131 --> 00:33:11,963
And what is interesting and hopefully engaging is that we now have some generations that have no real reckoning with the Civil Rights Movement who are gonna have to get up to speed real quick, and they're gonna have to get, as you say, out in the streets, because that's where the battle's gonna be fought.

326
00:33:12,684 --> 00:33:13,824
So yeah, it's...

327
00:33:16,206 --> 00:33:19,928
Okay, so let's go back to the museum for a minute.

328
00:33:20,949 --> 00:33:22,410
You've accomplished some things, certainly.

329
00:33:23,671 --> 00:33:31,276
What accomplishments come to mind that you're kind of proud of and that you want to see continue to move forward?

330
00:33:42,504 --> 00:33:42,784
I think

331
00:33:45,312 --> 00:33:59,723
My biggest accomplishment, or the accomplishment that feels the most important to me in this moment, is that we started an art summer program.

332
00:34:01,385 --> 00:34:11,071
in which we work with 10 students, working with artist Stephen Hamilton from Boston, who is a weaver and a painter.

333
00:34:11,692 --> 00:34:23,940
And we taught kids how to weave, how to paint, how to do tie and dye, resist batiking.

334
00:34:25,081 --> 00:34:27,983
And then when they were done over that seven weeks,

335
00:34:28,783 --> 00:34:33,644
They had an art exhibition that opened up at Harvard last year.

336
00:34:33,664 --> 00:34:44,626
And to me, it's one of the proudest things I've ever done in the sense of, you know, this is I run a museum on the history of slavery.

337
00:34:44,846 --> 00:34:46,487
It is a former plantation site.

338
00:34:46,987 --> 00:34:53,488
And yet it's not lost on me that even though, you know, we always need more funding, we can still give back.

339
00:34:54,308 --> 00:35:00,392
And so it's one of the ways that we've been doing that with youth programming.

340
00:35:01,232 --> 00:35:12,338
And I think just really seeing how students took to the work so quickly, but more importantly, how they mostly were like, I guess, can we do this?

341
00:35:13,138 --> 00:35:16,280
The first day, Steven came in and was like, okay, we're gonna make bags.

342
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,881
And they're like, we don't know how to sew.

343
00:35:17,941 --> 00:35:19,582
And he's like, I know, isn't that something?

344
00:35:20,422 --> 00:35:22,184
By the end, you're gonna make a bag.

345
00:35:22,424 --> 00:35:24,245
And they're like, no, we're not.

346
00:35:24,265 --> 00:35:26,086
He's like, I have you for six hours.

347
00:35:26,126 --> 00:35:27,467
I promise you.

348
00:35:27,547 --> 00:35:29,809
And then they had bags at the end, you know?

349
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:39,576
And so also just, you know, I think for me seeing how they were skeptical at first and then they trusted us.

350
00:35:40,157 --> 00:35:43,960
And then at the end when they could bring their friends and family to the gallery,

351
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,500
You know, they were taking pictures.

352
00:35:48,441 --> 00:35:51,081
And they were like, wow, we actually did this.

353
00:35:51,121 --> 00:35:52,041
This was a big deal.

354
00:35:52,061 --> 00:36:04,063
And so I think just providing spaces for students to learn about the history, but also to learn important traditions that came with us from the continent and the Caribbean.

355
00:36:04,123 --> 00:36:05,084
They absolutely did.

356
00:36:05,684 --> 00:36:06,364
Absolutely did.

357
00:36:07,304 --> 00:36:07,844
Challenges.

358
00:36:10,144 --> 00:36:12,165
Oh, there are lots of those.

359
00:36:12,185 --> 00:36:12,225
OK.

360
00:36:19,065 --> 00:36:26,390
Yeah, so obviously I think I want everyone to come to the museum.

361
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:32,875
I think there's something really important about being there, walking through the museum, understanding the history.

362
00:36:34,536 --> 00:36:39,380
And so it is one of the biggest challenges is how do we keep raising the visibility?

363
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:45,885
How do we keep pushing ourselves through programming, through the way that we tell

364
00:36:46,545 --> 00:37:08,419
the history, how do we try to get every school child in the state of Massachusetts to know the name of Belinda Sutton, who is one of the black women who was enslaved on the plantation, but then had a successful petition that gave her reparations, one of the earliest in the country.

365
00:37:08,499 --> 00:37:09,060
I want people

366
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:13,341
to know her name as much as they know Frederick Douglass' name, you know?

367
00:37:14,181 --> 00:37:27,445
And so the challenge is about, you know, really making that history accessible, invisible, and constantly, obviously, you know, fundraising in order to do the work that needs to be

368
00:37:28,085 --> 00:37:28,486
done.

369
00:37:28,666 --> 00:37:35,236
But I think for me, a part of the challenge is there's so much to do.

370
00:37:35,256 --> 00:37:41,986
And also understanding that I take the work very seriously.

371
00:37:43,087 --> 00:37:44,928
And my board takes the work very seriously.

372
00:37:44,948 --> 00:37:57,195
And making sure that we still get people there by not just only wanting to talk about the things that I want to talk about, right?

373
00:37:57,576 --> 00:37:58,056
Which is like,

374
00:37:58,456 --> 00:37:59,757
let's talk about the history of slavery.

375
00:37:59,797 --> 00:38:03,118
Do you know about the body of liberties?

376
00:38:03,798 --> 00:38:05,859
Maybe that's not appealing to everyone.

377
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:22,465
But what might be appealing is, I don't know, a poetry slam, or a arts program, or sewing classes, which we just did for MLK weekend.

378
00:38:23,286 --> 00:38:26,107
And if that is what community members

379
00:38:27,067 --> 00:38:31,169
want to do, and that's how I get them into the door, then I guess that's what I have to do, you know?

380
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:34,992
So just being attuned and asking people, well, what do you want to do?

381
00:38:35,112 --> 00:38:37,813
What do you want to do here?

382
00:38:37,873 --> 00:38:39,654
How can you make this space your own?

383
00:38:39,994 --> 00:38:41,535
And then I get to sneak in the history, right?

384
00:38:41,635 --> 00:38:43,636
Then if you're here, then you can go on a tour.

385
00:38:43,776 --> 00:38:44,717
And we do it all the time.

386
00:38:44,957 --> 00:38:45,797
You go on a tour.

387
00:38:46,358 --> 00:38:53,482
You can learn everything that I want you to take away from the site, but also not everyone's going to be able to get.

388
00:38:54,062 --> 00:38:54,582
to the site.

389
00:38:54,662 --> 00:39:00,224
So my next challenge is how do we bring the Royal House and Slave Quarters to Dorchester?

390
00:39:00,284 --> 00:39:03,886
How do we bring the Royal House and Slave Quarters to Roxbury?

391
00:39:03,946 --> 00:39:05,927
How do we get out to Mattapan?

392
00:39:05,967 --> 00:39:10,168
That means that we have to go to people instead of always expecting people to come to us.

393
00:39:11,989 --> 00:39:13,650
Wow, that's brilliant, that's brilliant.

394
00:39:15,372 --> 00:39:28,201
So again, we're in this current state of racial reckoning for some, and a growing retreat from a healthy dialogue about diversity, equity, and inclusion for others.

395
00:39:29,862 --> 00:39:33,985
What do you think that means for a cultural institution like yours?

396
00:39:35,614 --> 00:39:37,075
Oh, I don't know.

397
00:39:37,095 --> 00:39:38,016
I'm thinking about it a lot.

398
00:39:38,536 --> 00:39:39,737
I'm thinking about it every day.

399
00:39:39,757 --> 00:39:41,898
Yeah, I know we are, too.

400
00:39:42,238 --> 00:39:42,698
Absolutely.

401
00:39:42,718 --> 00:39:44,039
It's scary, you know.

402
00:39:44,059 --> 00:39:44,800
Yeah, it is.

403
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:46,161
But.

404
00:39:49,082 --> 00:39:49,823
I mean, I don't.

405
00:39:50,886 --> 00:39:55,269
I honestly don't have an answer other than I'm gonna keep doing what I'm doing.

406
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:59,973
And that's because I'm talking about the history, you know?

407
00:39:59,993 --> 00:40:04,716
You can't, like, what are you gonna say to me that didn't happen?

408
00:40:04,796 --> 00:40:07,038
Like, that's not true.

409
00:40:07,458 --> 00:40:11,802
And to be completely honest, I think, you know, these things really,

410
00:40:12,777 --> 00:40:24,520
worry me, and at the same time, I am always reminded by something that a mentor told me early on in grad school when I was like, do I even wanna do this?

411
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:25,620
What am I doing?

412
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:28,601
I'm 23, I can't believe I'm here.

413
00:40:28,641 --> 00:40:29,821
Why did I sign up for this?

414
00:40:29,861 --> 00:40:33,142
I should not be doing this.

415
00:40:33,242 --> 00:40:35,723
But I wanna do this, but what am I doing?

416
00:40:36,563 --> 00:40:38,023
And I'm like, will I get a job?

417
00:40:39,484 --> 00:40:40,244
And she told me,

418
00:40:41,899 --> 00:40:47,802
when people started doing black studies, they didn't know if they were gonna get a job.

419
00:40:49,583 --> 00:40:50,783
That wasn't the motivation.

420
00:40:51,043 --> 00:41:02,449
The motivation was to start these black studies programs, to get their degrees, to do the history, to write the books, so that no one can say that we weren't there.

421
00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:10,373
And it's not to say that people do not deserve jobs, I wanna be very clear, but I think my motivation is to do the work.

422
00:41:11,622 --> 00:41:12,743
And I'm gonna do the work.

423
00:41:14,223 --> 00:41:17,945
I'm gonna do the work publicly, loudly, visibly.

424
00:41:18,585 --> 00:41:23,307
And if for some reason I have to reimagine a way to do it, I'm gonna reimagine how to still do it.

425
00:41:24,888 --> 00:41:28,549
I'm going to not back down.

426
00:41:29,930 --> 00:41:34,092
And a part of that is because I don't know how to back away from telling the truth.

427
00:41:35,892 --> 00:41:40,433
And as a scholar, it is literally my responsibility to do that.

428
00:41:40,913 --> 00:41:44,274
As a museum leader, it is also my responsibility to do that.

429
00:41:44,374 --> 00:41:49,755
But it's also my responsibility, you know, not just to the site, but to my ancestors to do that.

430
00:41:50,795 --> 00:41:54,736
And so I think, I don't know, I'm gonna just keep on keeping on.

431
00:41:54,756 --> 00:41:56,496
You know, hope that

432
00:42:00,527 --> 00:42:05,068
you know, all that matters is that the work can still be done, however it needs to get done.

433
00:42:06,469 --> 00:42:09,850
But it is scary times that we're in.

434
00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:15,011
And at the same time, you know, it doesn't stop.

435
00:42:15,231 --> 00:42:16,952
It's invigorating as a matter of fact.

436
00:42:17,292 --> 00:42:20,693
You know, it's funny because we're kindred spirits in that regard.

437
00:42:20,713 --> 00:42:25,394
You know, you as a scholar, me as a poet, I guess I'm a scholarly poet, I like to say that.

438
00:42:25,835 --> 00:42:26,455
But anyways,

439
00:42:28,469 --> 00:42:37,371
I think probably for the first time in my life as a writer, I had one of those moments where I said, ooh, did I really want to say this?

440
00:42:38,792 --> 00:42:47,614
And I think that scared me more than anything else that was going on, is that it put me in a place where I was thinking retreat.

441
00:42:48,454 --> 00:42:55,756
But the good thing about it is that my other sensibilities, as yours do, I'm sure, slapped me around real quick.

442
00:42:56,296 --> 00:42:57,877
They said, get out of there.

443
00:42:58,138 --> 00:43:06,104
You're going to say exactly what you've always been saying, because what you've always been saying is what needs to be said right now.

444
00:43:06,164 --> 00:43:08,166
And I said some of it five years ago.

445
00:43:08,726 --> 00:43:10,948
I look back on some of the writing that I've done.

446
00:43:11,268 --> 00:43:15,532
I said some of it seven and 10 years ago.

447
00:43:15,672 --> 00:43:18,535
Chickens come home to roost eventually.

448
00:43:20,076 --> 00:43:21,377
They do, they just do.

449
00:43:21,757 --> 00:43:31,424
And we're just gonna have to be ready with that hatchet to chop their heads off and watch them run around.

450
00:43:31,544 --> 00:43:32,725
And then make wings.

451
00:43:33,005 --> 00:43:39,189
I also just wanna say really quickly that there are people who have always doubted whether or not we're supposed to be here anyway.

452
00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:44,033
So there are people who will be like, how are you doing what you're supposed to do?

453
00:43:44,073 --> 00:43:48,216
It doesn't even matter that I have the same training, that I have all of the accolades.

454
00:43:48,696 --> 00:43:57,822
You know, exactly, most likely more, you know, but people will doubt me anyway.

455
00:43:57,902 --> 00:44:14,073
And so I can't allow that to change me because at the end of the day, you know, I am the granddaughter of, you know, a black woman who never finished, you know, high school.

456
00:44:14,233 --> 00:44:16,154
So, and she,

457
00:44:17,673 --> 00:44:23,096
went to every, you know, she was always watching all the city council meetings.

458
00:44:23,517 --> 00:44:28,060
The first time she took me to vote was for a school board election.

459
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:29,460
I didn't even know at the time.

460
00:44:29,501 --> 00:44:30,901
I'm like, what are we voting?

461
00:44:30,961 --> 00:44:31,882
What are you voting for?

462
00:44:31,942 --> 00:44:34,063
You know, come on, this is important, you know?

463
00:44:34,484 --> 00:44:36,165
And I say that to say that

464
00:44:36,885 --> 00:44:44,028
you know, my great-grandmom survived many things and was never afraid and always showed up.

465
00:44:44,128 --> 00:44:46,389
And I think, you know, I learned that from her.

466
00:44:46,409 --> 00:44:48,650
So I'm gonna keep on showing up.

467
00:44:50,391 --> 00:44:52,012
And yeah, that's it.

468
00:44:52,192 --> 00:44:53,032
I love it, I love it.

469
00:44:53,273 --> 00:44:58,875
So, philosophically, you know, you're a museum leader.

470
00:44:58,895 --> 00:45:00,956
You know, what's your,

471
00:45:03,199 --> 00:45:08,501
What's your thought about what a museum is supposed to do and what it's supposed to bring to the people?

472
00:45:16,443 --> 00:45:26,027
So I think there are lots of different ways that museums can activate communities.

473
00:45:27,007 --> 00:45:27,527
For me, I

474
00:45:31,748 --> 00:45:35,237
think that, personally, museums

475
00:45:38,747 --> 00:45:40,588
bear responsibility to tell the truth.

476
00:45:41,709 --> 00:45:46,973
They bear responsibility to think about all of the publics that they must engage.

477
00:45:49,314 --> 00:45:58,821
And more importantly for me, I want the Royal House and Slave Quarters to be a place in which community members can feel like they get to steward the space as well.

478
00:45:59,261 --> 00:46:01,562
That they can come and they can reckon with the history.

479
00:46:02,363 --> 00:46:08,107
They can come and they can feel as though it is their space to

480
00:46:09,588 --> 00:46:24,518
have a say in, and more importantly, I think a place where we can really think about the times, we can think about what is impacting our communities the most, and we can strategize together moving forward.

481
00:46:24,658 --> 00:46:27,760
And I think that that's a part of telling the history, right?

482
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:36,146
So you can't come to the royal house and slave quarters and say, man, I learned about the history of slavery,

483
00:46:37,426 --> 00:46:43,110
And wow, I'm so, you know, glad that we have moved out of that period in history.

484
00:46:43,671 --> 00:46:44,411
No, no, no, no, no.

485
00:46:44,531 --> 00:46:51,856
I want you to go to the museum and say, well, how has the history of slavery still impacted black communities today?

486
00:46:52,436 --> 00:46:53,917
That is the charge.

487
00:46:55,038 --> 00:46:55,278
Right.

488
00:46:55,378 --> 00:46:57,800
It's not just to know about the history.

489
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:02,383
It's also to know about how the legacies of slavery

490
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:07,223
still impact people on a daily basis.

491
00:47:08,623 --> 00:47:24,913
And for me, once we do that, when we do that, and we allow it to be a space where community members can reckon with that history, and I'm borrowing that from Lonnie Bunch, I think what happens is that

492
00:47:27,078 --> 00:47:43,685
it becomes a space that is not only privileged in the sense about who has access to it, but it also becomes a space in which people don't just come on site and feel harmed.

493
00:47:44,345 --> 00:47:50,288
I want specifically people to come on site and to feel proud.

494
00:47:50,568 --> 00:47:54,310
And it's not to say that it's not a hard history, because it is a very hard history.

495
00:47:54,750 --> 00:48:01,694
But while we're talking about all of the violence, I want also people to walk away and say,

496
00:48:03,134 --> 00:48:22,703
and my ancestors built this, and they resisted, and they served in the Revolutionary War, and they went and built lives in different communities, and had whole lives.

497
00:48:22,803 --> 00:48:30,026
I want people to really think about black people as having a whole world, regardless of whether or not they were enslaved or free.

498
00:48:30,086 --> 00:48:31,287
They still had families.

499
00:48:31,727 --> 00:48:40,791
they built lives, they had hopes, they had dreams, they had sorrows, but they had a world.

500
00:48:41,131 --> 00:48:45,033
And I want people to understand that black people have worlds.

501
00:48:46,714 --> 00:48:49,635
And in that understanding,

502
00:48:50,315 --> 00:48:53,597
there's so much healing that gets derived from that.

503
00:48:53,657 --> 00:49:06,523
So you can come into a space and learn some of the history and feel harmed, but as you exit the space, based on everything that you've learned and everything that you've been made aware of, now it becomes a space of healing.

504
00:49:06,623 --> 00:49:07,024
Exactly.

505
00:49:07,044 --> 00:49:07,344
I love it.

506
00:49:07,624 --> 00:49:08,024
I love it.

507
00:49:08,164 --> 00:49:08,705
It's beautiful.

508
00:49:11,766 --> 00:49:15,008
Do you feel like you're positioned for future success?

509
00:49:19,278 --> 00:49:19,618
Yes.

510
00:49:21,859 --> 00:49:23,219
Yes.

511
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:25,660
I think it's a great question actually.

512
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:32,122
I do feel like I'm positioned for future success because I have a lot of people who believe in me.

513
00:49:33,682 --> 00:49:35,523
I have a lot of people who support me.

514
00:49:37,544 --> 00:49:46,249
I have a lot of people who are committed to catching me if I start to fall.

515
00:49:47,490 --> 00:49:55,295
And so for me, I feel like the way that I even define success is to be able to have that.

516
00:49:55,575 --> 00:49:57,697
That's what makes me feel successful.

517
00:49:58,497 --> 00:50:13,981
It's like yes, I do this work and I love this work and I get to talk to people all the time, which I like Yes, but at the end of the day what matters to me the most is that if you call me you might have to call me twice three times I'm gonna answer I'm gonna come through I

518
00:50:17,663 --> 00:50:24,710
And I am going to show up for people in the same way that they show up for me.

519
00:50:24,831 --> 00:50:26,933
Because we can't do this work without one another.

520
00:50:27,713 --> 00:50:28,895
And so, yeah.

521
00:50:30,717 --> 00:50:36,062
Yeah, we're building community and we're gonna build it whether or not people want us to or not.

522
00:50:37,628 --> 00:50:40,631
So will you play a little game of word association with me?

523
00:50:40,891 --> 00:50:41,111
Of course.

524
00:50:41,131 --> 00:50:41,231
OK.

525
00:50:41,351 --> 00:50:41,612
All right.

526
00:50:41,832 --> 00:50:47,196
So I'm going to give you a word, and I'm going to ask you to please give me a few sentences on what that word means to you.

527
00:50:47,477 --> 00:50:48,297
Can we do that?

528
00:50:48,357 --> 00:50:48,538
Yes.

529
00:50:48,678 --> 00:50:48,958
OK.

530
00:50:49,058 --> 00:50:49,318
All right.

531
00:50:49,618 --> 00:50:49,859
All right.

532
00:50:49,899 --> 00:50:56,424
So the first word, and this is as broadly or as narrowly as you want to define it, the first word is community.

533
00:50:57,065 --> 00:50:57,385
Love.

534
00:50:58,246 --> 00:50:58,546
Oh, wow.

535
00:50:58,887 --> 00:50:59,207
OK.

536
00:50:59,467 --> 00:50:59,787
All right.

537
00:51:00,648 --> 00:51:01,829
Transparency.

538
00:51:03,330 --> 00:51:03,891
Necessary.

539
00:51:05,016 --> 00:51:05,957
Okay, all right.

540
00:51:06,577 --> 00:51:07,498
Philanthropy.

541
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:09,700
Essential.

542
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:13,524
Courage.

543
00:51:21,371 --> 00:51:21,871
Courage.

544
00:51:26,496 --> 00:51:27,817
I'm usually not at a loss for words.

545
00:51:35,853 --> 00:51:36,253
Vital.

546
00:51:36,974 --> 00:51:38,115
Okay, okay.

547
00:51:38,736 --> 00:51:40,437
Especially right now, surely.

548
00:51:41,298 --> 00:51:41,938
Adversity.

549
00:51:41,958 --> 00:52:03,917
I would say adversity is, hmm.

550
00:52:11,232 --> 00:52:12,133
Not a limitation.

551
00:52:13,214 --> 00:52:13,614
Wow.

552
00:52:14,335 --> 00:52:14,715
OK.

553
00:52:15,035 --> 00:52:15,656
I like that.

554
00:52:15,756 --> 00:52:16,316
I like that.

555
00:52:16,717 --> 00:52:17,577
Perspective.

556
00:52:26,805 --> 00:52:34,672
I would say perspective, what comes to mind is healing.

557
00:52:36,128 --> 00:52:37,208
Okay, okay.

558
00:52:37,388 --> 00:52:39,110
Let me push you a little bit on that one.

559
00:52:39,570 --> 00:52:42,292
When you say healing, tell me what you mean.

560
00:52:43,553 --> 00:52:53,639
I think in many ways that sometimes when we can step back and we can have perspective, we can see things more clearly.

561
00:52:55,040 --> 00:53:03,206
And more importantly, I think just for all of us as individuals, having perspective also means that we give ourselves grace

562
00:53:04,588 --> 00:53:05,808
I like that, I like that.

563
00:53:07,149 --> 00:53:08,931
And then finally stewardship.

564
00:53:25,262 --> 00:53:27,103
Stewardship I would say is

565
00:53:39,398 --> 00:53:39,978
Diversity.

566
00:53:40,999 --> 00:53:41,219
Yeah.

567
00:53:41,980 --> 00:53:42,260
Yeah.

568
00:53:43,041 --> 00:53:43,741
Absolutely.

569
00:53:44,522 --> 00:53:46,323
Everybody has to be engaged.

570
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:48,084
Everybody gets to play.

571
00:53:48,144 --> 00:53:48,404
Yeah.

572
00:53:48,765 --> 00:53:49,045
Right.

573
00:53:49,585 --> 00:53:52,547
And if we do a little bit, we all get to take a trophy home.

574
00:53:53,128 --> 00:53:53,468
Exactly.

575
00:53:53,488 --> 00:53:55,209
You know, and it's not viewed as a bad thing.

576
00:53:55,369 --> 00:53:55,930
Exactly.

577
00:53:55,950 --> 00:53:56,510
Hallelujah.

578
00:53:56,670 --> 00:53:56,970
All right.

579
00:53:57,431 --> 00:53:57,691
All right.

580
00:53:57,731 --> 00:54:05,736
So five years from now, what will you want the people of Medford to know about the royal house property and your stewardship of that resource?

581
00:54:06,317 --> 00:54:06,417
Oh.

582
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:10,982
Five years from now.

583
00:54:16,635 --> 00:54:19,281
I would say five years from now.

584
00:54:21,933 --> 00:54:46,233
I would want people to see that the Royal House and Slave Quarters is not just a house museum, but has the potential and is essential to understanding slavery in the North so that it becomes a center that does so.

585
00:54:48,194 --> 00:54:51,057
And five years from now, I want

586
00:54:51,597 --> 00:55:00,405
people to say, more importantly, that I made the space more accessible.

587
00:55:03,187 --> 00:55:05,929
I made the history more expansive.

588
00:55:08,432 --> 00:55:12,395
And more importantly, I made them proud.

589
00:55:14,313 --> 00:55:15,174
Alright, alright.

590
00:55:15,914 --> 00:55:20,457
Okay, alright, so this maybe takes a little bit of the pressure off you.

591
00:55:20,477 --> 00:55:21,958
I know I've been a little bit rough on you.

592
00:55:23,399 --> 00:55:37,609
But you, of all resources in Medford to me right now, are sitting on, you know, one of the true gold mines that we have.

593
00:55:38,229 --> 00:55:45,752
So I, you know, I was, when I thought about sitting down and talking with you, I said, you know, I can't left Kiara off easy.

594
00:55:46,092 --> 00:55:49,673
You know, I'm gonna have to, we're gonna have to grill some fish on this one.

595
00:55:49,713 --> 00:55:50,653
All right, let's do it.

596
00:55:50,713 --> 00:55:51,234
So it's all right.

597
00:55:51,554 --> 00:55:52,054
Okay, so.

598
00:55:52,074 --> 00:55:53,014
I look snapper.

599
00:55:53,034 --> 00:55:54,495
Oh, red snapper?

600
00:55:54,535 --> 00:55:56,856
Yeah, you Caribbean, Caribbean girl, you know?

601
00:55:57,476 --> 00:55:58,276
Red snapper.

602
00:55:59,376 --> 00:56:03,678
What would people who are just meeting you for the first time be surprised to learn about you?

603
00:56:04,343 --> 00:56:05,525
Oh, that's a good question.

604
00:56:05,545 --> 00:56:08,009
I don't know, actually.

605
00:56:08,029 --> 00:56:08,109
Yeah.

606
00:56:16,607 --> 00:56:21,431
Probably that I'm a little, I'm a little shy.

607
00:56:21,451 --> 00:56:32,499
I think I am so much in the public that I talk all the time.

608
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:40,525
But actually, people are quite surprised that if I walk into a space, I will most likely hang out in the back.

609
00:56:41,926 --> 00:56:48,450
I always work up the courage to go do the thing, but initially, you know, it's okay.

610
00:56:48,610 --> 00:56:49,451
It's okay.

611
00:56:49,511 --> 00:56:51,432
I'm a little reserved.

612
00:56:51,492 --> 00:56:52,953
Well, I'm a little reserved.

613
00:56:53,293 --> 00:56:56,915
Listen, you gotta let the introvert in you get out sometimes.

614
00:56:56,996 --> 00:56:57,836
That I am not.

615
00:57:01,118 --> 00:57:02,019
Unfortunately.

616
00:57:02,699 --> 00:57:07,080
I'm quite an extrovert, but I'm a reserved extrovert.

617
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:08,961
It's an interesting dichotomy.

618
00:57:09,001 --> 00:57:10,961
Yeah, I think that's probably it.

619
00:57:12,882 --> 00:57:15,342
But yeah, I think it's a little thing.

620
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:17,123
All right, so it's only fair.

621
00:57:18,243 --> 00:57:24,124
I've taken some shots to give you an opportunity to take a shot at me.

622
00:57:24,584 --> 00:57:26,365
What shots do I have to take?

623
00:57:26,485 --> 00:57:30,066
Any question you think you might want to ask, you can do it.

624
00:57:31,707 --> 00:57:35,209
Um, I guess I don't have any shots to take.

625
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:35,630
Okay.

626
00:57:35,650 --> 00:57:36,390
That's wild.

627
00:57:37,271 --> 00:57:39,672
Um, but I, I do have a question.

628
00:57:39,692 --> 00:57:39,953
Okay.

629
00:57:40,993 --> 00:57:47,878
Um, given your illustrious career as a poet.

630
00:57:49,139 --> 00:57:49,439
All right.

631
00:57:50,179 --> 00:57:51,780
I'm just going to take the compliment.

632
00:57:51,820 --> 00:57:52,120
Okay.

633
00:57:52,141 --> 00:57:52,361
Yeah.

634
00:57:52,581 --> 00:57:52,661
Um,

635
00:57:55,804 --> 00:58:00,949
How do you think we can use literature to respond to these times?

636
00:58:02,951 --> 00:58:19,348
It's funny because it kind of dovetails and takes me back to that moment that I had where I was feeling kind of a little bit scared about some of the things that I might say and how those things might be interpreted by folks.

637
00:58:19,948 --> 00:58:34,698
But I think that my duty, and it's actually biblical, it comes from Habakkuk 2 and 2, and it says, write these things down so that a herald can run with it.

638
00:58:34,758 --> 00:58:40,863
So I may not be the person that runs with it, but I have to be the person that writes it down.

639
00:58:41,603 --> 00:58:53,734
And the other thing is that if there's a generation of poets coming up after me, and they see that I'm scared to say the things that I think I need to say, then they might be scared to say the things that they need to say.

640
00:58:54,235 --> 00:58:56,497
So I've got to be, you know,

641
00:58:57,517 --> 00:59:01,459
I've got to have the courage of my literary convictions.

642
00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:06,162
And I've got to be able to tell the truth and shame the devils.

643
00:59:06,762 --> 00:59:09,843
Because there's a lot of devils right now.

644
00:59:10,604 --> 00:59:22,750
And if we cower in fear and we don't strike back at those that are striking at us, then we lose.

645
00:59:22,810 --> 00:59:26,372
We can't possibly win if we're not willing to fight.

646
00:59:26,972 --> 00:59:29,673
And now, I'm not a fighter fighter.

647
00:59:30,114 --> 00:59:32,415
I'm a pacifist by nature.

648
00:59:37,267 --> 00:59:39,688
But I'm a pacifist with a big mouth.

649
00:59:41,308 --> 00:59:47,070
So I've got something to say, and I can say it reasonably eloquently through my poetry.

650
00:59:47,550 --> 00:59:50,111
So that's what I'm going to do.

651
00:59:50,791 --> 01:00:00,454
And if it ends up being the thing that makes folks who are out there looking for folks that are doing subversive things, I'm just going to have to deal with that.

652
01:00:00,674 --> 01:00:03,295
I'm just going to have to deal with that.

653
01:00:04,715 --> 01:00:05,856
I'm going to give you the last word.

654
01:00:05,896 --> 01:00:06,896
What are your parting thoughts?

655
01:00:07,389 --> 01:00:07,789
Hmm.

656
01:00:18,494 --> 01:00:19,414
I've been reading a lot.

657
01:00:19,754 --> 01:00:20,915
OK.

658
01:00:24,817 --> 01:00:35,221
And I want to share a quote from Octavia Butler.

659
01:00:35,241 --> 01:00:36,662
OK.

660
01:00:42,192 --> 01:00:43,452
that I've been sitting with.

661
01:00:53,794 --> 01:00:55,174
Let's see if I can find it.

662
01:01:04,396 --> 01:01:09,217
So Octavia Butler has an essay in which she says,

663
01:01:11,020 --> 01:01:15,681
So why try to predict the future at all if it's so difficult, so nearly impossible?

664
01:01:16,321 --> 01:01:22,162
Because making predictions is one way to give warning when we see ourselves drifting in dangerous directions.

665
01:01:22,742 --> 01:01:26,923
Because prediction is a useful way of pointing out safer, wiser courses.

666
01:01:27,483 --> 01:01:30,784
Because most of all, our tomorrow is the child of our day.

667
01:01:31,424 --> 01:01:37,465
Through thought and deed, we exert a great deal of influence over this child, even though we can't control it absolutely.

668
01:01:38,145 --> 01:01:39,487
Best to think about it, though.

669
01:01:39,927 --> 01:01:42,370
Best to try to shape it into something good.

670
01:01:42,850 --> 01:01:44,512
Best to do that for any child.

671
01:01:46,034 --> 01:01:57,827
And I think in thinking about where we are today and the reason why we have to continue to do the work is that, you know,

672
01:02:00,886 --> 01:02:06,771
as Octavia Butler says, that we should be doing that anyway and for everyone.

673
01:02:06,871 --> 01:02:07,331
Absolutely.

674
01:02:08,452 --> 01:02:11,855
And so I think my last parting words would be,

675
01:02:17,549 --> 01:02:19,530
There's a lot to be afraid of.

676
01:02:19,550 --> 01:02:22,811
A lot of people have a lot of things on the line.

677
01:02:23,912 --> 01:02:30,314
And I think if we remember that we are all in community with one another.

678
01:02:33,162 --> 01:02:43,393
I think it'll help everyone feel as though they can live their most true and authentic life because we got one another.

679
01:02:43,753 --> 01:02:45,135
And so, that's where I'll end.

680
01:02:45,175 --> 01:02:47,758
All right, well that's a hallelujah moment, okay.

681
01:02:48,378 --> 01:02:57,100
All right, well, listen, thank you for bringing your broad perspective and your great insight to the cultural community in Medford.

682
01:02:57,520 --> 01:03:01,882
It's really, it's important where I can't stress it enough that you're engaged in.

683
01:03:02,622 --> 01:03:05,323
And I hope the city will continue to treat you well.

684
01:03:07,643 --> 01:03:21,269
To everyone watching, thanks so much for your attentiveness and your interest in our discussion, and thanks for coming along with us as we continue to refresh for greater flexibility in bringing the best stories and entertainment possible.

685
01:03:21,750 --> 01:03:32,955
I want you to get ready for something very special on the musical side of the coin right after we take a break to reset our stage and share some WMCC announcements.

686
01:03:33,495 --> 01:03:33,895
All right?

687
01:03:34,315 --> 01:03:35,776
Don't go too far.

688
01:03:53,037 --> 01:03:55,982
Melinda, I'm sorry, can you take a picture?

689
01:08:06,521 --> 01:08:11,183
We had a quick changeover, so we're going to get back to the business of the evening.

690
01:08:11,203 --> 01:08:11,243
OK.

691
01:08:23,148 --> 01:08:23,508
OK.

692
01:08:27,230 --> 01:08:27,670
It's OK.

693
01:08:27,730 --> 01:08:28,130
It's OK.

694
01:08:28,490 --> 01:08:28,930
I understand.

695
01:08:28,970 --> 01:08:29,771
It's important stuff.

696
01:08:30,851 --> 01:08:32,792
Collaborations, it's important stuff.

697
01:08:33,192 --> 01:08:34,153
So we're good.

698
01:08:35,511 --> 01:08:36,613
All right, all right.

699
01:08:37,254 --> 01:08:41,199
As she's on her way out the door, another hand for Kiara.

700
01:08:42,280 --> 01:08:42,821
All right.

701
01:08:43,943 --> 01:08:45,345
Very, very wonderful.

702
01:08:45,365 --> 01:08:45,445
Okay.

703
01:08:46,828 --> 01:08:50,869
All right, so thanks to everyone who joined us for MLK over at St.

704
01:08:50,929 --> 01:08:51,570
Ray Fields.

705
01:08:51,630 --> 01:09:01,273
It really was a wonderful event, community building in its truest and most engaging sense.

706
01:09:01,553 --> 01:09:09,915
We have a lot to do, and we will continue to need your participation and partnerships to make things work.

707
01:09:12,096 --> 01:09:20,821
For my part, you know, I would hope that the elders continue to join us each week, Tuesday through Thursday, for a nutritious lunch and a vibrant fellowship.

708
01:09:21,601 --> 01:09:23,282
Lunch is served at 12 noon.

709
01:09:23,362 --> 01:09:27,504
Call 781-483-3042 to make a reservation.

710
01:09:27,524 --> 01:09:37,670
And please, consider taking membership in the West Medford Community Center and make sure that we have your contact information for future outreach and news.

711
01:09:38,270 --> 01:09:47,698
There are going to be a number of updates over the next few months as we ramp up activities connected to the 90th anniversary of the West Medford Community Center.

712
01:09:47,718 --> 01:09:49,400
All right?

713
01:09:50,420 --> 01:10:02,431
So if you're interested in volunteering or assisting, please connect with Lisa Crossman or myself, and we'll try and figure out how to get you plugged in.

714
01:10:03,651 --> 01:10:04,992
and how you can help us.

715
01:10:05,352 --> 01:10:10,494
Your tax-deductible donations help to support the mission of WMCC.

716
01:10:10,874 --> 01:10:13,675
Partner with us in carrying the mission forward.

717
01:10:13,735 --> 01:10:19,018
Please consider making a tax-deductible donation to this vital community organization.

718
01:10:19,498 --> 01:10:23,059
You can make your donation by phone, online, or by check.

719
01:10:23,519 --> 01:10:27,481
Please contact Lisa at 781-483-3042 for more information or to become a member.

720
01:10:27,521 --> 01:10:27,621
Okay.

721
01:10:34,895 --> 01:10:42,126
Now it's time to turn to the lyrical miracle we've engaged for tonight's substantive entertainment.

722
01:10:45,503 --> 01:10:46,083
Don't you love it?

723
01:10:46,123 --> 01:10:46,763
Don't you love it?

724
01:10:46,803 --> 01:10:52,585
See, when a man knows what to do, or a woman as well, you know, it just goes so nicely.

725
01:10:53,005 --> 01:11:06,730
OK, so tonight we feature a well-established and highly professional performer and performer and performer that has both gained a huge local following and also made some international friends.

726
01:11:07,570 --> 01:11:20,220
As a singer and beloved performer and as a musician, and again, one of the greats in Boston, Athene Wilson is another one of Boston's exceptional musical treasures.

727
01:11:20,620 --> 01:11:29,747
Her sultry, soulful voice and dynamic personality have garnered her the attention and respect of the region's finest musicians and venues.

728
01:11:30,287 --> 01:11:38,853
Athene has shown an unrivaled ability to mold herself into any musical situation, jazz, pop, funk, soul, you name it.

729
01:11:39,313 --> 01:11:44,277
She is a singer's singer and is much beloved around these parts.

730
01:11:45,098 --> 01:11:58,147
Singing with such Boston musical legends as Leon Beal and David Fuller and Walter Beasley, Athene is a certified star on the local music scene and is a three-time Boston Urban Music Award winner.

731
01:11:58,767 --> 01:12:04,309
People around the world have enjoyed her melodic sounds in jazz clubs, concerts, and special events.

732
01:12:04,810 --> 01:12:10,812
She is a consummate professional with a vibe that keeps her audience engaged and moving.

733
01:12:11,373 --> 01:12:21,277
As one might suspect, she began her singing career at the tender age of seven in a small Pentecostal church in Jamaica Mine.

734
01:12:22,777 --> 01:12:40,031
Athene is ably assisted by another local musical legend, my man, the multi-talented musician, keyboard artist, and esteemed collaborator, Rollins Ross, who we've had the pleasure of hosting on several occasions, most recently when he played here with David Fuller.

735
01:12:40,751 --> 01:12:45,475
All right, all right, welcome back to West Medford, Athene Wilson and Rollins Ross.

736
01:12:45,515 --> 01:12:48,618
I'm gonna get out your way and let y'all do what you do.

737
01:12:53,955 --> 01:13:00,199
Let's hear it for Brother Terry, the poet with the most.

738
01:13:01,160 --> 01:13:02,520
All right, all right.

739
01:13:02,540 --> 01:13:06,523
So I'm so happy to be back here with you all.

740
01:13:06,563 --> 01:13:11,806
I was here a couple of times before, and it's always a pleasure to come back.

741
01:13:12,186 --> 01:13:13,487
So how y'all doing?

742
01:13:15,928 --> 01:13:16,368
Excellent.

743
01:13:16,668 --> 01:13:19,410
As Brother Terry said, this is Rollins Ross.

744
01:13:20,210 --> 01:13:25,533
So we're going to just give you some eclectic taste today, all right?

745
01:13:25,573 --> 01:13:27,914
So as you know, we do jazz, gospel, R&B, and all that.

746
01:13:28,194 --> 01:13:30,816
So you might have that eclectic taste today, all right?

747
01:13:31,636 --> 01:13:31,956
All right.

748
01:13:35,978 --> 01:13:38,340
So in the climate that we're in,

749
01:13:40,450 --> 01:13:45,733
Brother Marvin Gaye wrote the song almost 60 years ago, right?

750
01:13:46,954 --> 01:13:51,916
And it still is something that we have to reckon with.

751
01:13:52,056 --> 01:13:52,817
What's going on?

752
01:13:53,977 --> 01:13:54,758
What's going on?

753
01:13:55,518 --> 01:13:56,219
I'd like to know.

754
01:13:57,379 --> 01:14:00,721
But towards the end of the song, we kind of tagged on something to it.

755
01:14:01,662 --> 01:14:05,143
And we kind of gave it, you'll see what I'm talking about.

756
01:14:05,163 --> 01:14:05,684
I'll let you know.

757
01:14:18,065 --> 01:14:25,251
Mother, mother, far too many of you crying.

758
01:14:28,434 --> 01:14:35,900
And brother, brother, brother, far too many of you dying.

759
01:14:38,486 --> 01:14:50,779
You know we've got to find a way to bring some loving here today.

760
01:14:50,959 --> 01:14:56,805
Father, Father, Father, we don't need to escalate.

761
01:15:01,143 --> 01:15:03,083
War is not the answer.

762
01:15:03,784 --> 01:15:04,244
No, it's not.

763
01:15:05,204 --> 01:15:10,505
Only love can conquer hate.

764
01:15:10,625 --> 01:15:21,347
You know we've got to find a way to bring some loving here today.

765
01:15:21,507 --> 01:15:22,187
Come on.

766
01:15:22,287 --> 01:15:24,368
Picket signs, brother.

767
01:15:24,828 --> 01:15:26,868
Picket lines, brother.

768
01:15:29,858 --> 01:15:31,759
Brutality.

769
01:15:32,679 --> 01:15:36,460
Talk to me, brother, so you can see.

770
01:15:37,420 --> 01:15:39,941
Oh, what's going on?

771
01:15:40,441 --> 01:15:42,862
What's going on?

772
01:15:43,182 --> 01:15:45,823
What's going on?

773
01:15:45,883 --> 01:15:47,143
What's going on?

774
01:15:50,644 --> 01:15:51,425
I still don't know.

775
01:15:56,286 --> 01:15:58,207
I hope we find out, though, and soon.

776
01:16:02,091 --> 01:16:07,893
Everybody thinks we're wrong.

777
01:16:32,055 --> 01:16:33,895
Who are they to judge us?

778
01:16:35,416 --> 01:16:40,417
Simply cause our hair's too long, too long.

779
01:16:40,457 --> 01:16:51,679
You know we know we've got to find a way to bring some loving here today.

780
01:16:51,739 --> 01:16:52,739
Come on.

781
01:16:52,839 --> 01:16:56,440
Picket lines, sister, picket sign.

782
01:16:58,225 --> 01:17:02,469
Punish me with brutality.

783
01:17:02,609 --> 01:17:07,573
You gotta talk to me so you can see.

784
01:17:08,494 --> 01:17:10,075
Oh, what's going on?

785
01:17:11,336 --> 01:17:13,558
What's going on?

786
01:17:14,038 --> 01:17:15,420
What's going on?

787
01:17:16,761 --> 01:17:17,581
What's going on?

788
01:17:17,802 --> 01:17:24,267
And he used to say, right on, right on, right on, right on.

789
01:17:26,871 --> 01:17:46,306
♪ Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

01:17:52,859 --> 01:18:01,042
Mother, everybody thinks we're wrong, yeah.

791
01:18:01,762 --> 01:18:09,524
Who are they to judge us, judge us, simply cause your hair's too long?

792
01:18:10,385 --> 01:18:21,048
You know we've got to find a way to bring some loving here today.

793
01:18:23,532 --> 01:18:27,133
Picket lines, brother, picket signs.

794
01:18:28,494 --> 01:18:32,675
Don't punish me, so you can see.

795
01:18:33,896 --> 01:18:38,377
You better talk to me, so you can see.

796
01:18:39,277 --> 01:18:41,318
Oh, what's going on?

797
01:18:42,118 --> 01:18:43,819
What's going on?

798
01:18:44,939 --> 01:18:46,160
What's going on?

799
01:18:46,620 --> 01:18:49,401
So here's what we answered the song with.

800
01:18:50,735 --> 01:18:54,739
What's going on is you have to spread some love, right?

801
01:18:54,759 --> 01:18:56,661
So we just simply say, yes.

802
01:18:56,721 --> 01:18:59,444
All we have to do is spread love, love, love.

803
01:18:59,464 --> 01:19:00,625
Spread love, love, love.

804
01:19:00,645 --> 01:19:01,686
Spread love, love, love.

805
01:19:14,048 --> 01:19:16,610
Love.

806
01:19:16,650 --> 01:19:17,491
Spread love.

807
01:19:18,171 --> 01:19:18,711
Love.

808
01:19:19,412 --> 01:19:19,892
Love.

809
01:19:20,233 --> 01:19:21,554
All you got to do is spread some love.

810
01:19:22,814 --> 01:19:25,196
Give yourself a hand for helping us out.

811
01:19:28,659 --> 01:19:29,139
All right.

812
01:19:29,980 --> 01:19:36,064
All right.

813
01:19:36,104 --> 01:19:39,347
So this next one, Brother Stevie did.

814
01:19:41,551 --> 01:19:47,336
And he just said, love's in need of love, right?

815
01:19:47,836 --> 01:19:50,979
You can tell where I'm going with this, this whole night.

816
01:19:51,239 --> 01:19:53,401
I got to pound it in.

817
01:19:53,441 --> 01:19:54,682
We need some love, y'all.

818
01:19:54,782 --> 01:19:55,883
All right?

819
01:19:59,706 --> 01:20:01,808
Ooh, yeah.

820
01:20:02,348 --> 01:20:02,709
Come on.

821
01:20:04,370 --> 01:20:06,832
Good morning, evening, friends.

822
01:20:09,962 --> 01:20:14,966
Here's your friendly announcer.

823
01:20:15,526 --> 01:20:25,573
I've got some serious news to pass on to everybody.

824
01:20:26,374 --> 01:20:34,400
What I'm about to say could mean the world's disaster.

825
01:20:37,248 --> 01:20:45,498
could change your joy and laughter to tears and pain.

826
01:20:46,479 --> 01:20:54,448
You know that love's in need of a little love today.

827
01:21:02,203 --> 01:21:06,906
Come on, send it right away, yeah, yeah.

01:21:07,887 --> 01:21:19,474
You know that hate's going around breaking many hearts, oh.

829
01:21:19,494 --> 01:21:28,540
Stop it, please, before it goes too far, yeah, yeah.

830
01:21:52,552 --> 01:22:00,913
The force of evil plans to make it its own possessor.

831
01:22:03,134 --> 01:22:11,875
And it will, if you let it destroy everybody.

832
01:22:11,995 --> 01:22:21,957
We all must take precautionary measures.

833
01:22:24,150 --> 01:22:42,759
And the love if you treasure, you'll hear me when I say, you know that love's in need of a little love today.

834
01:22:43,780 --> 01:22:46,841
Don't delay.

835
01:22:47,702 --> 01:22:50,623
Come on, send it right away.

836
01:22:53,210 --> 01:23:02,516
You know that hate's going around breaking many hearts.

837
01:23:04,577 --> 01:23:12,162
Stop it, please, before it goes too far.

838
01:23:12,282 --> 01:23:14,504
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

839

Thank you.

842
01:23:42,330 --> 01:23:43,530
Mr. Ross on keys.

843
01:23:45,351 --> 01:23:46,291
All right.

844
01:23:46,331 --> 01:23:57,153
So a little jazz for you.

845
01:24:08,200 --> 01:24:10,642
Them that's got shall get.

846
01:24:12,923 --> 01:24:15,025
Them that's not shall lose.

847
01:24:16,446 --> 01:24:31,497
So the Bible says, and it still rings true, your mama may have, your papa he may have.

848
01:24:31,637 --> 01:24:35,600
God bless the child that's got his own.

849
01:24:39,105 --> 01:24:45,668
got his own.

850
01:24:45,788 --> 01:24:51,852
Rich relations give a crust of bread and such.

851
01:24:54,093 --> 01:24:55,694
You can help yourself.

852
01:24:56,054 --> 01:25:00,836
You can help yourself, but please don't take too much.

853
01:25:02,317 --> 01:25:05,318
Your mama may have.

854
01:25:05,979 --> 01:25:08,240
Your papa, he may have.

855
01:25:09,672 --> 01:25:22,080
God bless the child that's got his own, that's got his own.

856
01:25:24,501 --> 01:25:35,188
Money, you've got lots of friends, and they're crowding around your door.

857
01:25:38,602 --> 01:25:52,293
When the spending ends and all your money's gone, they don't come around no more.

858
01:25:53,774 --> 01:25:58,698
Rich relations give across the bread and sun.

859
01:26:01,104 --> 01:26:02,904
You can help yourself.

860
01:26:02,964 --> 01:26:04,105
You can help yourself.

861
01:26:04,145 --> 01:26:07,785
But please don't take too much.

862
01:26:09,646 --> 01:26:12,566
Your mama may have.

863
01:26:12,807 --> 01:26:15,247
Your papa, he may have.

864
01:26:16,447 --> 01:26:21,728
God bless the child that's got his own.

865
01:26:22,189 --> 01:26:24,469
That's got his own.

866
01:26:24,749 --> 01:26:26,609
Come on, Ron.

867
01:26:44,502 --> 01:26:45,262
All right.

868
01:26:45,382 --> 01:26:48,443
Ooh, money you've got.

869
01:26:48,523 --> 01:26:49,983
Lots of friends.

870
01:27:14,567 --> 01:27:20,968
Crowding around your door.

871
01:27:21,488 --> 01:27:26,929
When the spinning ends, all your money's gone.

872
01:27:28,109 --> 01:27:36,271
They don't come around no more.

873
01:27:36,411 --> 01:27:41,572
Rich relations give a crust of bread and such.

874
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:49,702
You can help yourself, help yourself, but please don't take too much.

875
01:27:51,363 --> 01:27:53,223
Your mama may have.

876
01:27:54,944 --> 01:27:57,045
Your papa may have.

877
01:27:58,605 --> 01:28:08,188
God bless the child that's got his own, that's got his own.

878
01:28:10,569 --> 01:28:13,210
Zuh-duh-dee-uh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh, yeah.

879
01:28:16,919 --> 01:28:18,040
That's God is all.

880
01:28:43,371 --> 01:28:44,133
Thank you so much.

881
01:28:44,173 --> 01:28:44,514

And it reminds me of Valentine's Day, too, which is coming up next week, next Friday.

So how about a little Valentine's early for you?

That's a good problem.

947
01:38:11,654 --> 01:38:18,228
Living for you, my dear, is like living in a world of constant fear.

948
01:38:32,690 --> 01:38:37,012
Somehow I must, somehow I must explain.

01:38:38,173 --> 01:38:46,278
I'm going to rap on your door, tap on it, tap on it, tap on your window pane.

We did a little something to the song.

962

I think it's fitting for now.

963
01:40:05,994 --> 01:40:08,776

Everything gonna be all right, yeah.

966
01:40:18,243 --> 01:40:21,245
We mashed it up.

967
01:40:22,326 --> 01:40:25,749
No woman no cry.

968
01:40:27,910 --> 01:40:34,055
I tell you no, no woman no cry.

969
01:40:35,939 --> 01:40:38,360
Oh, yeah.

970
01:40:39,861 --> 01:40:44,163
No woman, no cry.

971
01:40:45,444 --> 01:40:52,148
I tell you now, no woman, no cry.

972
01:40:54,470 --> 01:41:01,714
You're broken down and tired of living life on a merry-go-round.

973
01:41:03,775 --> 01:41:08,283
I know you feel like dying, but I see you.

974
01:41:08,363 --> 01:41:16,057
We're going to walk it out and move mountains.

975
01:41:17,352 --> 01:41:24,816
We're gonna walk it out in mountains.

976
01:41:24,856 --> 01:41:25,296
Guess what?

977
01:41:26,437 --> 01:41:27,717
And I'll rise up.

978
01:41:28,898 --> 01:41:30,359
Rise like the wave.

979
01:41:30,619 --> 01:41:31,459
I'll rise up.

980
01:41:32,700 --> 01:41:37,162
In spite of the ache, I'll rise up.

981
01:41:37,422 --> 01:41:40,204
And I'll do it a thousand times again.

982
01:41:40,344 --> 01:41:43,886
And I'll rise up.

983
01:41:45,026 --> 01:41:47,987
Rise with the waves, don't rise up.

984
01:41:48,007 --> 01:41:50,328
In spite of the ache, I'll rise up.

985
01:41:50,348 --> 01:41:55,031
And I'll do it 1,000 times again for you, for you.

986
01:42:15,207 --> 01:42:21,834
When the silence isn't quiet, and it feels like it's getting hard to breathe.

987
01:42:23,216 --> 01:42:29,763
I know you feel like dying, but I know you'll take the world to its feet.

988
01:42:30,184 --> 01:42:35,429
And I move mountains.

989
01:42:36,689 --> 01:42:44,672
I'm gonna walk it out and move mountains, yeah.

990
01:42:44,692 --> 01:42:50,055
And I'll rise up, rise like the day.

991
01:42:50,075 --> 01:42:54,337
And I'll rise up, rise unafraid.

992
01:42:54,417 --> 01:42:58,078
I'll rise up and do it 1,000 times again.

993
01:43:04,451 --> 01:43:07,292
Rise like the waves, I'll rise up.

994
01:43:08,192 --> 01:43:11,293
In spite of the anger, I'll rise up.

995
01:43:11,313 --> 01:43:13,113
I'll do it 1,000 times again.

996
01:43:13,153 --> 01:43:13,594
For you.

997
01:43:13,614 --> 01:43:13,834
For you.

998
01:43:13,894 --> 01:43:14,234
For you.

999
01:43:49,631 --> 01:43:55,015
I'll do it for you.

1000
01:43:58,858 --> 01:43:59,299
Thank you.

1001
01:43:59,319 --> 01:44:01,881
Woo, got me sweating up here.

1002
01:44:07,985 --> 01:44:08,926
Thank you so much.

1003
01:44:08,986 --> 01:44:09,506
Thank you.

1004
01:44:09,707 --> 01:44:10,227
Thank you.

1005
01:44:11,888 --> 01:44:12,889
Down to the river, huh?

1006
01:44:13,269 --> 01:44:14,430
Yes, yes.

1007
01:44:32,677 --> 01:44:32,957
All right.

1008
01:44:34,218 --> 01:44:35,639
You said something down by the river.

1009
01:44:35,659 --> 01:44:50,209
I'm going to lay down my burdens down by the riverside, down by the riverside, down by the riverside.

1010
01:44:50,309 --> 01:44:53,111
I'm going to lay down my burdens.

1011
01:44:55,104 --> 01:45:03,930
Down by the riverside, ain't gonna study war no more.

1012
01:45:04,891 --> 01:45:07,812
I ain't gonna study war no more.

1013
01:45:07,873 --> 01:45:08,353
Come on, Clay.

1014
01:45:08,813 --> 01:45:12,155
Ain't gonna study war no more.

1015
01:45:12,496 --> 01:45:14,977
Ain't gonna study war no more.

1016
01:45:19,866 --> 01:45:22,767
I ain't gonna study war no more.

1017
01:45:23,528 --> 01:45:26,649
I ain't gonna study war no more.

1018
01:45:27,329 --> 01:45:32,391
I ain't gonna study war no more.

1019
01:45:32,411 --> 01:45:42,536
Oh, I'm gonna lay down my sword and shield down by the riverside.

1020
01:45:42,636 --> 01:45:44,957
Way down.

1021
01:45:46,197 --> 01:45:47,578
Oh, way down.

1022
01:45:50,097 --> 01:46:15,842
♪ I ain't gonna lay down my sword and shield ♪ ♪ Down by the riverside ♪ ♪ Gonna study war no more ♪ ♪ I ain't gonna study war no more ♪ ♪ I ain't gonna study war no more ♪ ♪ I ain't gonna study war no more ♪

1023
01:46:21,103 --> 01:46:22,945
One of those freedom songs.

1024
01:46:42,986 --> 01:46:44,247
Yes, yes.

1025
01:46:44,948 --> 01:46:45,548
All right.

1026
01:46:47,290 --> 01:46:48,071
Don't stop now.

1027
01:46:49,832 --> 01:46:50,693
You said two minutes?

1028
01:46:51,794 --> 01:46:52,214
Two more.

1029
01:46:52,274 --> 01:46:53,535
OK, all right.

1030
01:46:57,059 --> 01:47:01,823
So we went from the jazz to the R&B, and we did the gospel.

1031
01:47:01,843 --> 01:47:03,925
We're going to stay in the gospel feel right now.

1032
01:47:05,086 --> 01:47:05,446
All right.

1033
01:47:21,099 --> 01:47:28,081
alone in a room, just me and you.

1034
01:47:29,862 --> 01:47:31,903
I feel so lost.

1035
01:47:33,863 --> 01:47:36,264
Don't know what I'm going to do.

1036
01:47:36,764 --> 01:47:46,287
So what if I choose the wrong thing to do?

1037
01:47:46,967 --> 01:47:48,348
I'm so afraid.

1038
01:47:49,501 --> 01:47:52,923
afraid of disappointing you.

1039
01:47:53,204 --> 01:48:09,936
So I need to talk to you and ask you for your guidance, especially today, when my life is so cloudy.

1040
01:48:10,216 --> 01:48:15,459
Lord, guide me until I'm sure.

1041
01:48:15,560 --> 01:48:18,602
And I'll open up.

1042
01:48:30,179 --> 01:48:36,863
Hopes and dreams are fading fast.

1043
01:48:37,703 --> 01:48:39,384
I'm so burnt out.

1044
01:48:41,285 --> 01:48:43,707
Don't know if my strength's going to last.

1045
01:48:43,807 --> 01:48:51,431
So I'm crying out, crying out to you, Lord.

1046
01:48:52,932 --> 01:48:56,634
I know you're able, able to save me.

1047
01:49:01,988 --> 01:49:15,532
to you and ask you for your guidance, especially today when my life is so cloudy.

1048
01:49:15,572 --> 01:49:25,416
Lord, guide me on till I'm sure, and I'll open up my heart.

1049
01:49:33,071 --> 01:49:40,752
So show me how to do things your way.

1050
01:49:41,593 --> 01:49:48,274
Don't let me make the same mistakes over and over again.

1051
01:49:48,454 --> 01:49:52,975
Your will be done.

1052
01:49:53,075 --> 01:50:00,076
And I'll be the one to make sure that it's carried out

1053
01:50:01,768 --> 01:50:21,255
And I'll ask you for your guidance, especially today, when my life is so cloudy.

1054
01:50:21,315 --> 01:50:25,236
Lord, guide me until I'm sure.

1055
01:50:26,376 --> 01:50:30,938
And I'll open up my eyes.

1056
01:50:37,595 --> 01:50:47,119
All I need is one word, one word, one word, and I'll open up my heart.

1057
01:50:50,980 --> 01:51:04,425
All I need is one word, oh, one word, one word, and I'll open up my heart.

1058
01:51:16,816 --> 01:51:17,336
Thank you.

1059
01:51:18,677 --> 01:51:22,099
Hallelujah.

1060
01:51:22,540 --> 01:51:23,000
All right.

1061
01:51:25,502 --> 01:51:26,102
Yes.

1062
01:51:27,223 --> 01:51:27,943
So one song.

1063
01:51:28,904 --> 01:51:30,265
You all can help me with this one.

1064
01:51:30,325 --> 01:51:38,071
I like to end every show where I do, when I can, just simply says, this little light of mine.

1065
01:51:39,912 --> 01:51:42,093
I'm gonna let it shine.

1066
01:51:42,593 --> 01:51:46,594
Oh, this little light of mine.

1067
01:51:46,934 --> 01:51:49,695
I'm gonna let it shine.

1068
01:51:50,335 --> 01:51:52,596
This little light of mine.

1069
01:51:53,136 --> 01:51:56,057
Oh, I'm gonna let it shine.

1070
01:51:56,557 --> 01:51:58,217
Let it shine.

1071
01:51:58,357 --> 01:51:59,798
Let it shine.

1072
01:52:00,198 --> 01:52:01,138
Let it shine.

1073
01:52:01,158 --> 01:52:02,418
Let me hear you sing now.

1074
01:52:02,438 --> 01:52:03,919
This little light.

1075
01:52:03,999 --> 01:52:04,379
Come on.

1076
01:52:04,699 --> 01:52:04,979
This.

1077
01:52:05,779 --> 01:52:08,060
Yeah, it's quiet.

1078
01:52:10,631 --> 01:52:11,612
I hope you can hear this.

1079
01:52:11,732 --> 01:52:15,295
I'm going to let it.

1080
01:52:16,176 --> 01:52:18,058
I'm going to let it shine.

1081
01:52:18,178 --> 01:52:23,422
This little light, this little light of mine.

1082
01:52:23,703 --> 01:52:25,844
I'm going to let it shine.

1083
01:52:26,285 --> 01:52:27,706
Let it shine.

1084
01:52:28,106 --> 01:52:29,688
Let it shine.

1085
01:52:29,968 --> 01:52:31,349
Let it shine.

1086
01:52:31,389 --> 01:52:37,555
Oh, there's a verse that says, everywhere I go, oh, everywhere I go, you're going to do what?

1087
01:52:40,981 --> 01:52:42,082
Oh, everywhere.

1088
01:52:42,382 --> 01:52:47,405
I'm gonna let it.

1089
01:52:48,125 --> 01:52:49,466
Everywhere.

1090
01:52:49,786 --> 01:52:51,947
Everywhere I go.

1091
01:52:52,127 --> 01:52:52,708
Yes.

1092
01:52:53,088 --> 01:52:55,389
I'm gonna let it shine.

1093
01:52:55,449 --> 01:52:56,250
Let it shine.

1094
01:52:56,310 --> 01:52:59,932
Let it shine.

1095
01:53:00,512 --> 01:53:03,694
Let it shine.

1096
01:53:04,014 --> 01:53:04,854
Big finish.

1097
01:53:04,995 --> 01:53:07,556
Let it shine.

1098
01:53:10,985 --> 01:53:13,427
Wonderful choir, thank you so much.

1099
01:53:14,428 --> 01:53:17,830
Yes, Mr. Rollins Ross on keys.

1100
01:53:20,132 --> 01:53:20,833
Brother Terry.

1101
01:53:25,356 --> 01:53:28,398
And West Medford Community Center, yes.

1102
01:53:28,518 --> 01:53:30,640
And all of you, thank you so much.

1103
01:53:31,961 --> 01:53:33,022
Thank you so much.

1104
01:53:35,095 --> 01:53:39,296
So, Athene and I go way back.

1105
01:53:39,356 --> 01:53:39,776
Way back.

1106
01:53:40,896 --> 01:53:49,018
Rollins and I maybe not quite as far, but there was a foundation in Boston called the Coming At You Foundation.

1107
01:53:49,038 --> 01:53:49,539
That's right.

1108
01:53:49,599 --> 01:53:53,940
And they were doing work in the kingdom, you know, real good community work.

1109
01:53:54,680 --> 01:53:58,101
And that's where I first met Athene.

1110
01:53:58,881 --> 01:54:00,641
She was one of their featured singers.

1111
01:54:00,661 --> 01:54:01,462
They had a choir.

1112
01:54:03,582 --> 01:54:05,283
And they have a choir.

1113
01:54:05,303 --> 01:54:09,584
They had a choir.

1114
01:54:09,904 --> 01:54:10,985
And we just clicked.

1115
01:54:11,725 --> 01:54:14,906
And so when I call, she comes.

1116
01:54:14,986 --> 01:54:18,267
And it's a beautiful thing, because everybody doesn't have it like that.

1117
01:54:20,269 --> 01:54:26,154
But I said to her after the first time she came, I said, you come out there and wreck my little community center.

1118
01:54:26,174 --> 01:54:27,535
Right.

1119
01:54:28,296 --> 01:54:32,139
And she's come back and she's wrecked my little community center again.

1120
01:54:32,219 --> 01:54:34,141
So, you know, you're welcome.

1121
01:54:34,161 --> 01:54:34,841
Thank you so much.

1122
01:54:34,881 --> 01:54:36,163
All about spreading the love.

1123
01:54:36,223 --> 01:54:36,503
Hallelujah.

1124
01:54:36,543 --> 01:54:36,963
Hallelujah.

1125
01:54:36,983 --> 01:54:37,304
Amen.

1126
01:54:37,324 --> 01:54:37,544
Amen.

1127
01:54:38,165 --> 01:54:42,570
And my man Rollins, you know, he just, you know, just back there.

1128
01:54:42,911 --> 01:54:45,534
And I call it tickle tickle because that's what he does.

1129
01:54:45,574 --> 01:54:47,056
He just tickles those keys.

1130
01:54:47,677 --> 01:54:49,259
And it's a beautiful thing.

1131
01:54:49,319 --> 01:54:52,403
Listen, thank you all for coming out this evening.

1132
01:54:54,706 --> 01:54:56,708
sharing this bitter community with us.

1133
01:54:56,828 --> 01:54:58,770
We need this more than ever.

1134
01:54:58,890 --> 01:55:02,895
I mean, we need to support each other, we need to love up on each other.

1135
01:55:03,215 --> 01:55:14,808
No matter what comes down the pike, we need to understand that this is a place that's a safe place in Medford, that people can gather and they can exchange ideas.

1136
01:55:15,829 --> 01:55:19,093
And they can feel free to kind of let loose a little bit.

1137
01:55:20,755 --> 01:55:24,499
We're not going to support any foolishness.

1138
01:55:24,519 --> 01:55:30,547
We're not going to let you come in here and try and tear down the community or tear down the people that we love and care about.

1139
01:55:30,967 --> 01:55:34,672
But we definitely want you to come and share community with us.

1140
01:55:36,073 --> 01:55:36,934
Become a member.
