1
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:06,110
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh,

2
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:06,268
Okay.

3
00:23:56,299 --> 00:23:56,748
[SPEAKER_02]: in a second.

4
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:49,033
[SPEAKER_02]: Applications, how to get summer jobs.

5
00:35:54,754 --> 00:35:57,837
[SPEAKER_06]: None of these programs could have happened without the teachers.

6
00:35:58,597 --> 00:36:10,667
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just specifically have to call out Laney Cahill, Michelle Desio, Melissa Calendarian, Julia Mitchell, Matt McKenna, who ran the elementary program for us.

7
00:36:11,147 --> 00:36:19,174
[SPEAKER_06]: And then Ami Sanye at the high school who coordinated the high school program with support from Joel Menasha and David Perez.

8
00:36:21,701 --> 00:36:31,628
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we had two EL in-class tutors, aides, who were doing family outreach, calling students when they weren't coming to the program.

9
00:36:32,309 --> 00:36:35,531
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was Mona Massawi and Sabrina Pinto.

10
00:36:35,871 --> 00:36:43,277
[SPEAKER_06]: And they worked in the classrooms with the students as well, in addition to helping, you know, keep the program going.

11
00:36:45,296 --> 00:36:51,422
[SPEAKER_06]: With regards to other updates, we hired six new staff members in the EL department this year.

12
00:36:51,962 --> 00:36:58,489
[SPEAKER_06]: We had three retirements, which I'll be talking to Susie about later, because I'd like to acknowledge them.

13
00:36:59,129 --> 00:37:02,633
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we also had two resignations.

14
00:37:03,619 --> 00:37:07,460
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have six new staff members, basically K through 12.

15
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:18,883
[SPEAKER_06]: We're entering year two of the change to the Missittuck for grades one through four newcomers and fifth grade newcomers at the McGlynn Elementary School.

16
00:37:19,623 --> 00:37:22,884
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we continue our Lesley University partnership.

17
00:37:22,944 --> 00:37:29,626
[SPEAKER_06]: This year we have two full year interns working in the newcomer classrooms at the Missittuck.

18
00:37:30,604 --> 00:37:35,648
[SPEAKER_06]: And then at the McGlynn Middle School, we're continuing with our co-teaching for math and science.

19
00:37:36,568 --> 00:37:51,799
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going back to our pre-pandemic model where the students are actually part of the classroom and the teachers are co-teaching and we'll continue with that professional development because we do have some changes at the middle school with staffing.

20
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:57,283
[SPEAKER_06]: So we wanna make sure everyone's on the same page and continuing that professional development.

21
00:37:58,145 --> 00:38:01,897
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we're going to be looking at our K through 12 curriculum.

22
00:38:02,482 --> 00:38:19,876
[SPEAKER_06]: doing some updates, we're going to be in the process of putting together a team to develop a writer's workshop program, because when we do the analysis of the access test, writing is typically the last domain to develop, and we're looking for ways to strengthen that to increase our writing scores.

23
00:38:20,556 --> 00:38:28,122
[SPEAKER_06]: And then last year, you approved the funding through the ESSER funds to continue with the imagined learning, and we're in the process of onboarding that.

24
00:38:30,084 --> 00:38:31,525
[SPEAKER_12]: Great, thank you, Mr. Taksera.

25
00:38:32,597 --> 00:38:33,538
[SPEAKER_12]: Member McLaughlin.

26
00:38:36,501 --> 00:38:36,962
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

27
00:38:37,142 --> 00:38:41,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr Tisha always good to see you and hear about your program.

28
00:38:41,686 --> 00:38:45,230
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you just for the, for the community and myself as well.

29
00:38:47,443 --> 00:38:52,186
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's the Early Elementary Urban Education Initiative through Lesley University.

30
00:38:52,706 --> 00:39:07,876
[SPEAKER_06]: So teacher candidates have the, they're in an accelerated one-year master's program that will enable them to get their one through six gen ed certification with an add-on EL license.

31
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:10,058
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

32
00:39:10,178 --> 00:39:12,800
[SPEAKER_05]: And then is there,

33
00:39:13,963 --> 00:39:34,437
[SPEAKER_05]: How many, I'm really happy to hear about the in class tutor and aids that we're doing the family and community engagement outreach to the community members and has there been much progress on the alpac know because last year everything was tabled just to the pandemic right because of the pandemic and I don't have my calendar with me but

34
00:39:34,943 --> 00:39:38,684
[SPEAKER_06]: we have a target date for another DELAC meeting.

35
00:39:39,544 --> 00:39:40,584
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's in November.

36
00:39:41,044 --> 00:39:53,647
[SPEAKER_06]: So the plan is for that to have teachers work at their building level to do, we always, when we come back to school, we'll do family information nights at the school level.

37
00:39:53,827 --> 00:39:58,548
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's just to help, you know, parents, caregivers, you know, navigate

38
00:39:59,388 --> 00:40:07,849
[SPEAKER_06]: the back to school piece, how to use the website, how to email their teacher, and then we'll use that as a recruitment tool for the DELAC.

39
00:40:08,169 --> 00:40:12,330
[SPEAKER_05]: And can you, again, with the acronym, let us know what the DELAC stands for?

40
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:14,671
[SPEAKER_06]: District English Learner Advisory Council.

41
00:40:14,931 --> 00:40:15,331
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

42
00:40:15,911 --> 00:40:23,852
[SPEAKER_05]: And then for the curriculum, is there a name for the K-12 EL curriculum and pacing guides?

43
00:40:24,652 --> 00:40:26,152
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's just the EL curriculum.

44
00:40:26,333 --> 00:40:27,113
[SPEAKER_06]: We follow the

45
00:40:29,582 --> 00:40:30,042
[SPEAKER_06]: frameworks.

46
00:40:30,542 --> 00:40:31,823
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they're not frameworks.

47
00:40:32,003 --> 00:40:36,724
[SPEAKER_06]: They're the English language proficiency benchmarks and outcomes.

48
00:40:36,764 --> 00:40:39,245
[SPEAKER_06]: So our curriculum is based on that.

49
00:40:39,685 --> 00:40:45,727
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the WIDA standards are folded into that because the WIDA standards focus on listening, reading, writing, and speaking.

50
00:40:46,127 --> 00:40:46,348
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

51
00:40:46,388 --> 00:40:47,628
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not a purchase curriculum.

52
00:40:47,648 --> 00:40:50,709
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a curriculum that you folks form based on those standards.

53
00:40:50,729 --> 00:40:53,530
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's our own curriculum that incorporates

54
00:40:53,989 --> 00:41:00,295
[SPEAKER_06]: So for the English piece, it incorporates the English language arts standards, the common core standards.

55
00:41:00,776 --> 00:41:08,543
[SPEAKER_06]: We bring in the English language development through the English language proficiency standards, and then the WIDA standards are a part of that as well.

56
00:41:08,563 --> 00:41:09,084
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

57
00:41:09,104 --> 00:41:10,925
[SPEAKER_05]: That's very helpful.

58
00:41:11,286 --> 00:41:11,706
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

59
00:41:11,806 --> 00:41:12,347
[SPEAKER_05]: This is great.

60
00:41:12,447 --> 00:41:14,629
[SPEAKER_05]: Congratulations on your successful summer program.

61
00:41:14,729 --> 00:41:15,029
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.

62
00:41:17,252 --> 00:41:17,512
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

63
00:41:20,203 --> 00:41:42,019
[SPEAKER_12]: We have number five, Adaptive Physical Education Programming, Director of Pupil Services, Supervisor of Health and Physical Education, and a certified Adaptive Physical Education Programming teacher will report on the initiation of Adaptive PE Programming in the 21-22 school year and the district's plans for additional Adaptive PE Programming in the years ahead.

64
00:41:43,204 --> 00:41:43,745
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening.

65
00:41:44,365 --> 00:41:50,412
[SPEAKER_11]: Before we start the presentation we just wanted to thank the committee for having this position in the budget this year.

66
00:42:00,203 --> 00:42:08,674
[SPEAKER_11]: And she has been working hard all summer and I think even before this summer because this has always been a goal of hers to have this program here in Medford.

67
00:42:09,475 --> 00:42:13,741
[SPEAKER_11]: So Paul is going to present and then we will be here for any questions that you may have.

68
00:42:14,221 --> 00:42:14,421
[SPEAKER_11]: Great.

69
00:42:18,675 --> 00:42:19,695
[SPEAKER_04]: Good evening, everyone.

70
00:42:19,735 --> 00:42:20,775
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for having me.

71
00:42:21,176 --> 00:42:25,877
[SPEAKER_04]: As Joan said, my name is Carla Andre and I'm the adapted physical education teacher in Medford.

72
00:42:26,577 --> 00:42:31,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Prior to this new role, I taught in the high school in the access program for the past five years.

73
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:45,201
[SPEAKER_04]: Tonight, I'm gonna take about 10 to 15 minutes of your time and just kind of detail what exactly adaptive physical education is and how we determine eligibility, who is eligible and what this means for students who require it.

74
00:42:45,981 --> 00:42:58,393
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm also going to talk a little bit with Rachel about unified sports in Medford and how adaptive physical education will kind of tie into that and where we are in the process just three and a half weeks into the school year.

75
00:43:00,752 --> 00:43:05,555
[SPEAKER_04]: So to start adapted or adaptive physical education, the term is really kind of interchangeable.

76
00:43:05,955 --> 00:43:08,897
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll see it listed differently depending on what district it's in.

77
00:43:09,438 --> 00:43:14,221
[SPEAKER_04]: Adaptive is a word we say to describe behavior and adapted is the act of modifying something.

78
00:43:14,581 --> 00:43:19,244
[SPEAKER_04]: In this case, the curriculum, APE for short, to make it easier.

79
00:43:20,256 --> 00:43:28,361
[SPEAKER_04]: Physical education is a direct mandated subject, just like ELA or math, students have to have it throughout their time here in Medford Public Schools.

80
00:43:29,162 --> 00:43:32,724
[SPEAKER_04]: Students who have a disability will qualify for eligibility determination.

81
00:43:33,345 --> 00:43:36,527
[SPEAKER_14]: Adaptive physical education meets the needs of students with disabilities.

82
00:43:42,794 --> 00:43:47,456
[SPEAKER_04]: There are 14 categories of disability in which a student can qualify for APE.

83
00:43:48,016 --> 00:43:52,098
[SPEAKER_04]: So a student must meet one or more of the listed disabilities that you see here.

84
00:43:52,158 --> 00:43:55,319
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's according to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.

85
00:43:55,899 --> 00:43:58,520
[SPEAKER_04]: In other words, the student already has an IEP established.

86
00:43:59,601 --> 00:44:02,822
[SPEAKER_04]: If they have an established disability, then they would be eligible for the service.

87
00:44:03,602 --> 00:44:05,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Students on a 504 can also qualify.

88
00:44:09,503 --> 00:44:16,312
[SPEAKER_04]: AP is determined with the use of formal assessments, and if a student is not safely or successfully accessing the curriculum.

89
00:44:17,413 --> 00:44:27,566
[SPEAKER_04]: So right now in Medford we have a list of students who have been referred, they've been referred by program teachers, physical education teachers, and related service providers.

90
00:44:28,226 --> 00:44:33,928
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to kind of walk you through, I guess, the eligibility process in Medford and what we're doing right now.

91
00:44:34,128 --> 00:44:41,550
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll get a list of the referrals, and I'm going to go into each school, which I have been doing cross-checking if they're eligible.

92
00:44:41,690 --> 00:44:47,031
[SPEAKER_04]: So if they have a disability and determine eligibility, I'll conduct a formal observation.

93
00:44:47,591 --> 00:44:53,673
[SPEAKER_04]: After the observation is conducted, the educational team leaders will reach out to parents for consent to

94
00:44:54,273 --> 00:44:55,434
[SPEAKER_04]: formally evaluate.

95
00:44:56,254 --> 00:45:04,199
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll be using an assessment tool and go in and do that formal assessment and then determine if the student is eligible.

96
00:45:04,739 --> 00:45:09,322
[SPEAKER_04]: If the student is eligible for this service, then it will go into a student's IEP.

97
00:45:13,990 --> 00:45:15,931
[SPEAKER_04]: So what does that look like for students?

98
00:45:16,391 --> 00:45:21,132
[SPEAKER_04]: So just like anything else with special ed, it's really individualized based on the student needs.

99
00:45:21,192 --> 00:45:27,314
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think the majority of what I'm seeing across the district will be supplemental PE.

100
00:45:27,374 --> 00:45:33,295
[SPEAKER_04]: So, and I mentioned this again in a couple of slides, but we're not replacing inclusion.

101
00:45:33,335 --> 00:45:38,377
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're not replacing students who are able to access general physical education.

102
00:45:39,017 --> 00:45:40,137
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not gonna pull them out.

103
00:45:40,737 --> 00:45:42,318
[SPEAKER_04]: So this will be supplemental to that.

104
00:45:42,938 --> 00:45:57,683
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's really, I do think physical education is kind of an easy way to include students, but APE will really kind of make sure the student is getting the most out of the subject.

105
00:45:59,703 --> 00:46:13,727
[SPEAKER_04]: So, sorry, you can stay here but it'll be a combination of small group supplemental it could be individualized one to one objectives, it could be a push in model, so it's really going to vary depending on what the student need is.

106
00:46:14,408 --> 00:46:15,508
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is just a visual.

107
00:46:16,068 --> 00:46:22,190
[SPEAKER_04]: This is just how I like to look at it at the bottom you'll see general physical education we're going to have the bulk of our students in that green area.

108
00:46:22,770 --> 00:46:28,413
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, as you go up the pyramid, the smallest piece there would be a separate APE class.

109
00:46:28,433 --> 00:46:36,256
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're looking at a really small number of students that would have only APE with no other general phys ed.

110
00:46:36,296 --> 00:46:40,418
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're looking at that subseparate being really the smallest.

111
00:46:44,912 --> 00:46:54,375
[SPEAKER_04]: This is just a visual, I'm not gonna go through every single example, but it's just examples of kind of made up students with disabilities and where they might fall.

112
00:46:54,916 --> 00:47:01,558
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you keep clicking through, you know, based on their description, they'll fall into a category here on these circles.

113
00:47:01,618 --> 00:47:12,402
[SPEAKER_04]: So whether it's general PE mixed in with supplemental APE, it could be an APE class mixed in with that one-to-one kind of pull out or,

114
00:47:12,982 --> 00:47:15,084
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, a combination of the three in some cases.

115
00:47:15,104 --> 00:47:24,390
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, you can just quickly.

116
00:47:25,071 --> 00:47:26,112
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

117
00:47:26,212 --> 00:47:27,193
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

118
00:47:27,473 --> 00:47:38,781
[SPEAKER_04]: And so this side, I just added, you know, I don't have to go into detail about this, but a lot of, you know, a question I've been asked is, what is the difference between physical therapy?

119
00:47:39,041 --> 00:47:39,862
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, did I go ahead one?

120
00:47:42,043 --> 00:47:43,444
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I had one.

121
00:47:43,524 --> 00:47:45,085
[SPEAKER_04]: So FAPE and least restrictive environment.

122
00:47:45,106 --> 00:47:49,209
[SPEAKER_04]: So as I mentioned, we're not replacing it, we're supplementing it.

123
00:47:51,190 --> 00:47:56,435
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you wanna go to the next slide, I'm gonna actually mention unified sports, perfect.

124
00:47:57,055 --> 00:48:00,338
[SPEAKER_04]: This year we're fortunate enough to have unified sports at the high school level.

125
00:48:00,358 --> 00:48:10,426
[SPEAKER_04]: This is gonna be a team for students of all abilities and it gives students with disabilities the opportunity to safely participate in afterschool athletics in a comfortable and safe environment.

126
00:48:11,662 --> 00:48:22,655
[SPEAKER_04]: This isn't to say that students with disabilities cannot participate in typical athletics, but it's a program that is really intentionally designed to create that meaningful inclusion that we've talked so much about.

127
00:48:26,138 --> 00:48:35,780
[SPEAKER_04]: I mentioned common ground, or some of you might know that I've been involved in common ground, which was a topic of our subcommittee, our special ed subcommittee that Melanie kind of led.

128
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:49,883
[SPEAKER_04]: So the future of adapted physical education, my hope, and I mean, this is something in the future of what kind of a long term vision is for me and for us, is that I think it has a lot of potential for that meaningful reverse inclusion.

129
00:48:50,783 --> 00:49:02,166
[SPEAKER_04]: It's my hope that eventually we'll have a unified PE class in which students at the middle school and high school level elect to take a physical education class with students of diverse abilities or all abilities.

130
00:49:02,846 --> 00:49:06,827
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it really intentionally creates, you know, that meaningful inclusion.

131
00:49:06,947 --> 00:49:16,389
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I guess, you know, overall, the overarching idea of this is that we're not pulling students out of a general physical education class.

132
00:49:16,449 --> 00:49:17,389
[SPEAKER_04]: This is supplemental.

133
00:49:18,009 --> 00:49:19,970
[SPEAKER_04]: This is something that students do require.

134
00:49:20,770 --> 00:49:21,971
[SPEAKER_04]: as a mandated subject.

135
00:49:22,092 --> 00:49:25,174
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, we don't have to show the last couple of slides.

136
00:49:25,775 --> 00:49:29,998
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll take any questions and Joan and Rachel and I can answer them if you have any.

137
00:49:30,699 --> 00:49:30,979
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

138
00:49:30,999 --> 00:49:31,279
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

139
00:49:32,781 --> 00:49:33,901
[SPEAKER_12]: Can may I ask a question.

140
00:49:35,263 --> 00:49:38,005
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, I didn't see any hands member McLaughlin.

141
00:49:39,808 --> 00:49:55,702
[SPEAKER_12]: You can, I defer to you America first, and I'll go after the mayor from the chair I just had the question of, you're starting the program so how do you handle, do you go to every school during the day, or schedule like yeah logistically students do you service.

142
00:49:56,623 --> 00:50:05,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now, since we have never had it in Medford we're working on building up the program, sort of, we didn't have it so it wasn't already on students IEPs in Medford.

143
00:50:06,787 --> 00:50:13,449
[SPEAKER_04]: There might be situations where it was on a student's IEP maybe that student came from out of district, or was returning from an out placement.

144
00:50:13,809 --> 00:50:15,190
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's what I looked at first.

145
00:50:16,030 --> 00:50:20,392
[SPEAKER_04]: After that, I got referrals, just from PE teachers from

146
00:50:21,392 --> 00:50:26,376
[SPEAKER_04]: program teachers, I would say my referral list is about 70 right now, 75.

147
00:50:26,676 --> 00:50:32,260
[SPEAKER_04]: That doesn't mean that every student who has a disability requires this.

148
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:38,204
[SPEAKER_04]: You do need to have a disability to be eligible, but it does not mean if you have one, you definitely will require this.

149
00:50:38,244 --> 00:50:40,205
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's important once I get the referral.

150
00:50:40,245 --> 00:50:46,970
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've been going into every school and observing these students in their PE class, in some cases at recess.

151
00:50:48,150 --> 00:50:50,392
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was where I started.

152
00:50:50,832 --> 00:50:53,134
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm doing formal observations now.

153
00:50:53,655 --> 00:50:59,979
[SPEAKER_04]: And then once those are complete, we'll have the assessment ready to go and we'll get consent to evaluate.

154
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:01,541
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

155
00:51:01,561 --> 00:51:02,161
[SPEAKER_04]: Member McLaughlin?

156
00:51:02,181 --> 00:51:02,461
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

157
00:51:02,481 --> 00:51:03,722
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for this presentation.

158
00:51:10,652 --> 00:51:12,554
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr McLaughlin if you could turn number.

159
00:51:13,455 --> 00:51:14,235
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, now it's on.

160
00:51:14,736 --> 00:51:18,860
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Miss Andre for this information, Medford's lucky to have you.

161
00:51:20,341 --> 00:51:33,414
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would ask, specifically, I felt like the graphic the previous graphic with the different levels of modifications accommodations and specialized instruction for AP was a little.

162
00:51:35,873 --> 00:51:48,226
[SPEAKER_05]: I was, I was concerned about the top graphic where it was strictly AP, do I understand correctly that AP does not meet the requirements or does meet the requirements for phys ed requirement for a visit.

163
00:51:48,306 --> 00:51:52,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I was just that's just a visual to kind of show that, you know, as students

164
00:51:53,751 --> 00:51:55,673
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of think of it like a sub-separate classroom.

165
00:51:56,494 --> 00:52:01,158
[SPEAKER_04]: So you probably have the smallest amount of our population in those sub-separate classrooms.

166
00:52:01,219 --> 00:52:05,963
[SPEAKER_04]: And we try to keep the inclusion as much as possible through co-taught, through a small group, or whatever it might be.

167
00:52:05,983 --> 00:52:14,932
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's just a visual to show that there might be a few students who cannot participate in general phys ed for whatever reason.

168
00:52:15,593 --> 00:52:17,475
[SPEAKER_04]: But that would be our smallest population.

169
00:52:17,835 --> 00:52:18,055
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

170
00:52:18,155 --> 00:52:21,396
[SPEAKER_05]: And just for FAPE and the least restrictive environment.

171
00:52:21,436 --> 00:52:31,138
[SPEAKER_05]: So FAPE, you know, is the free and appropriate public education in the least restrictive environment when supports and services are, you know, when a disability prevents from otherwise.

172
00:52:31,198 --> 00:52:40,040
[SPEAKER_05]: But one of the concerns I know the previous director had around APE was that we were going to be creating a substantially separate program for kids with disabilities.

173
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:41,660
[SPEAKER_05]: And obviously that's not what we want to do.

174
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:43,341
[SPEAKER_05]: We want meaningful inclusion.

175
00:52:43,361 --> 00:52:44,461
[SPEAKER_05]: And I hear you saying that.

176
00:52:44,841 --> 00:53:06,642
[SPEAKER_05]: But I just also want to bring it to the committee's attention into the community's attention that this is not what we want to do we are not looking to further segregate, especially in opportunities when there are ways to meaningfully include our children we're really looking about accessibility and so as somebody was sharing with me at a point when we did not want to participate in sort of adaptive programs because we wanted

177
00:53:07,182 --> 00:53:14,347
[SPEAKER_05]: full inclusion, they were saying that adaptive programs help the child access or the student access the full inclusion at some point.

178
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:18,990
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a scaffolding and a support, but it's not meant to substitute, right?

179
00:53:19,611 --> 00:53:22,012
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, I just wanted to clarify that for the community as well.

180
00:53:22,052 --> 00:53:27,036
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, I'm excited about this program and we're looking forward to your- Yes.

181
00:53:28,317 --> 00:53:31,999
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe an update in a couple of months after you've done your evaluations, that'd be great.

182
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:33,481
[SPEAKER_12]: Member Van de Kloot?

183
00:53:33,521 --> 00:53:35,442
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I just wanna add, this is really exciting.

184
00:53:39,022 --> 00:53:39,602
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for your work.

185
00:53:39,882 --> 00:53:40,182
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

186
00:53:40,202 --> 00:53:40,542
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

187
00:53:41,123 --> 00:53:41,683
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

188
00:53:41,783 --> 00:53:42,123
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

189
00:53:44,103 --> 00:53:53,446
[SPEAKER_12]: If we could move to take paper number, item number one off the table now that superintendent Edward Vincent has audio.

190
00:53:57,207 --> 00:53:59,468

01:02:06,741 --> 01:02:08,122
[SPEAKER_12]: Glad you're back with us.

274
01:02:08,702 --> 01:02:09,043
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

275
01:02:10,012 --> 01:02:34,402
[SPEAKER_12]: Eight, we have virtual virtual network infrastructure repair and replacement request assistant superintendent of finance and operations will report on an urgent technology infrastructure repair project, specifically the replacement of the network unified storage devices that are critical for the continued viability of storage archiving and disaster recovery capabilities for the metro public schools virtual network.

276
01:02:35,008 --> 01:02:43,852
[SPEAKER_12]: The administration will be requesting authorization for the expenditure not to exceed 190,000 of the previously appropriated capital improvement funding.

277
01:02:44,213 --> 01:02:44,673
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. Murphy.

278
01:02:45,193 --> 01:02:45,713
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mayor.

279
01:02:46,634 --> 01:02:59,440
[SPEAKER_07]: The committee received a memo over the course of the weekend that we've reached a place of urgency with respect to the infrastructure that supports our virtual environment.

280
01:03:00,841 --> 01:03:04,403
[SPEAKER_07]: This is infrastructure that was procured a decade ago

281
01:03:05,043 --> 01:03:09,386
[SPEAKER_07]: that had a shelf life of much shorter than a decade.

282
01:03:09,406 --> 01:03:15,289
[SPEAKER_07]: Typically, generally speaking, we think of this as infrastructure that would last approximately five years.

283
01:03:16,009 --> 01:03:24,014
[SPEAKER_07]: We did have some warranty extensions that, as I understand it, were obtained in the course of the last 10 years.

284
01:03:25,274 --> 01:03:28,156
[SPEAKER_07]: But the hardware is essentially worn out.

285
01:03:29,117 --> 01:03:29,737
[SPEAKER_07]: And with

286
01:03:30,823 --> 01:03:55,211
[SPEAKER_07]: The warranties having expired, we're in a position of significant risk, which sort of came into sharp relief to us during a planned power outage on August 20 where the district was repairing an electrical transformer at the high school requiring us to evacuate a planned evacuation the building at the at the end of the day on a Friday and.

287
01:03:57,532 --> 01:04:06,901
[SPEAKER_07]: When we went to turn the power back on that weekend, it became apparent to our IT staff and the engineers who are on site in anticipation of these types of challenges.

288
01:04:07,542 --> 01:04:14,609
[SPEAKER_07]: That it wasn't clear that the virtual network was going to come back with the speed and efficiency that we needed to or, I guess, come back at all.

289
01:04:15,610 --> 01:04:18,333
[SPEAKER_07]: And at that point we determined that we would have to

290
01:04:19,063 --> 01:04:36,393
[SPEAKER_07]: identify this as our first capital priority of the new school year, and we would ask for your blessing to use the part of the capital improvement funding that was allocated approximately one year ago to put forth put toward this project.

291
01:04:37,253 --> 01:04:40,375
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that we've had discussions in this forum and at the subcommittee level.

292
01:04:40,821 --> 01:04:53,904
[SPEAKER_07]: about a variety of capital improvement projects and you'll be hearing much more about those in the coming weeks and months, but this is an issue that we felt couldn't wait any longer and so we'd ask for your approval to move forward with that.

293
01:04:54,424 --> 01:05:01,746
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Arena is also on the call if there are a higher level of granularity that I'm unable to respond to.

294
01:05:02,746 --> 01:05:03,506
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

295
01:05:03,526 --> 01:05:05,427
[SPEAKER_12]: Is there a motion on the floor or any questions?

296
01:05:06,187 --> 01:05:06,707
[SPEAKER_12]: Member Rousseau.

297
01:05:11,627 --> 01:05:14,689
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr McLaughlin, if you could turn member Rousseau's microphone on, please.

298
01:05:14,929 --> 01:05:15,330
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

299
01:05:18,492 --> 01:05:24,716
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm glad we're having this conversation on the right side of the potential catastrophe here.

300
01:05:25,477 --> 01:05:29,680
[SPEAKER_10]: I do, and I realize we don't have a lot of

301
01:05:30,740 --> 01:05:34,822
[SPEAKER_10]: runway to do long term planning, considering the state we're in.

302
01:05:35,823 --> 01:05:50,332
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just looking at some of this and thinking, you know, our other school districts going to the cloud for a lot of this stuff, and we're buying servers, and in 2033 we can come back and talk about these old servers that are

303
01:05:50,912 --> 01:05:52,153
[SPEAKER_10]: going to fail on us again?

304
01:05:52,834 --> 01:06:00,420
[SPEAKER_10]: Or is part of this, you know, get us over the hump so that we can at least be sure that tomorrow morning or whenever we will still have a network.

305
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:11,748
[SPEAKER_10]: And when there's some space, is somebody tasked with eventually coming up with a longer term plan so that we aren't just rinsing and repeating this problem every 10 years?

306
01:06:12,269 --> 01:06:19,174
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I would say two things to that, Mr. So and if Mr. Arena wants to add on to my comments, I would invite him to do so.

307
01:06:20,665 --> 01:06:26,567
[SPEAKER_07]: One, this repair project will expand our archival capacity by 300%.

308
01:06:26,867 --> 01:06:36,210
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think it's sort of a consequence of having waited this long that there'll be a much more optimal set of infrastructure that would be put into place.

309
01:06:36,610 --> 01:06:44,872
[SPEAKER_07]: My understanding that there is a large cloud-based component of this project as well, though I would defer to Mr. Arena on the specifics of that.

310
01:06:45,653 --> 01:06:49,434
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I think with regard to the long-term planning, I guess I would say two things.

311
01:06:51,849 --> 01:07:06,520
[SPEAKER_07]: We've identified, as part of the strategic plan, the need to further articulate, itemize, and prioritize all of the capital repair projects so that it's something that will be revisited by the school committee and the administration on an annual basis.

312
01:07:06,560 --> 01:07:12,265
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's one key component to making sure that we're not experiencing the same set of challenges over and over and over again.

313
01:07:12,885 --> 01:07:19,270
[SPEAKER_07]: We have had conversations with Tufts University and other potential partners about developing more longer-term

314
01:07:20,017 --> 01:07:21,979
[SPEAKER_07]: strategic planning with respect to infrastructure.

315
01:07:22,459 --> 01:07:34,189
[SPEAKER_07]: I think those conversations need to continue, and they also have to be, I think, put into the context of some of the broader infrastructure challenges that this community will have to confront in the coming years, with regard to certain facilities.

316
01:07:35,010 --> 01:07:35,370
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

317
01:07:35,911 --> 01:07:36,591
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion to approve.

318
01:07:37,132 --> 01:07:37,472
[SPEAKER_12]: Second.

319
01:07:38,573 --> 01:07:41,495
[SPEAKER_12]: Motion for approval by Member Rousseau, seconded by Member van de Kloot.

320
01:07:41,676 --> 01:07:45,058
[SPEAKER_12]: All those in favor, or do we need a roll call vote?

321
01:07:51,563 --> 01:07:54,143
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

322
01:07:54,223 --> 01:07:54,463
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

323
01:07:55,063 --> 01:07:56,944
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

324
01:07:57,244 --> 01:08:00,004
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, seven the affirmative zero and the negative the paper is approved.

325
01:08:00,024 --> 01:08:00,524
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

326
01:08:00,844 --> 01:08:13,727
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, human number nine human capital report, assistant superintendent of finance and operations will present on appointments and staffing changes in staffing in response to request for regular updates on personnel changes.

327
01:08:14,331 --> 01:08:25,166
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Thank you, Mayor, members of the committee have asked over the course of the last year for us to implement some type of reporting, with respect to our personnel changes and fluctuations.

328
01:08:25,867 --> 01:08:30,213
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a very early draft of that type of report and something that we wanted to

329
01:08:30,673 --> 01:08:36,534
[SPEAKER_07]: get in front of you to get your feedback so that as we institute this as a monthly process, we're keeping the committee updated.

330
01:08:37,134 --> 01:08:41,615
[SPEAKER_07]: We're bringing to you the information that you find relevant and that you'd like to know about.

331
01:08:41,695 --> 01:08:43,735
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's basically five components of this.

332
01:08:44,235 --> 01:08:47,416
[SPEAKER_07]: I will say, I'll preface this, that first of all, there's only two slides to this.

333
01:08:47,456 --> 01:08:51,517
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you're concerned about how long this presentation is about to go, I can put your mind at ease.

334
01:08:52,317 --> 01:08:53,777
[SPEAKER_07]: There's five components to this.

335
01:08:53,857 --> 01:08:56,217
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the personnel report, the human capital report.

336
01:08:57,217 --> 01:08:59,758
[SPEAKER_07]: To begin the school year will always be the potentially the most

337
01:09:00,438 --> 01:09:07,521
[SPEAKER_07]: complicated and lengthy, because we're just frankly trying to obtain what information the committee would find relevant.

338
01:09:07,941 --> 01:09:13,043
[SPEAKER_07]: I did not dive deeply into this, and so there are

339
01:09:13,876 --> 01:09:31,853
[SPEAKER_07]: There, this is fairly complicated and very fluid information that would be in any human capital report, especially the one at the beginning of the school year, so I would not, I would essentially take all the numbers you're about to see with some degree of a grain of salt, some of the variables that will be obvious in a second if we go to the next slide.

340
01:09:32,357 --> 01:09:45,003
[SPEAKER_07]: is that our appointments at a very technical level include appointments to summer work that essentially last two months and then the position goes away for the next nine and a half months so.

341
01:09:45,482 --> 01:09:48,944
[SPEAKER_07]: That's really not an accurate reflection of the overall composition of our staffing.

342
01:09:49,444 --> 01:09:53,247
[SPEAKER_07]: But as we pull data that's that's the type of information that we have to see.

343
01:09:53,347 --> 01:10:03,093
[SPEAKER_07]: So once we know that this is in fact the components of the report that the committee would like to see, we'll spend more time making sure that it's parsed out in that

344
01:10:03,758 --> 01:10:07,583
[SPEAKER_07]: We're actually able to give you information that you can draw accurate conclusions from but essentially.

345
01:10:08,224 --> 01:10:14,072
[SPEAKER_07]: This is what we'd be looking at is discussing with you the new appointments individuals that are coming into the organization for the first time.

346
01:10:14,813 --> 01:10:22,042
[SPEAKER_07]: Promotions, I think, is important to because it's an organizational value of ours that we want to identify the internal talent and give.

347
01:10:22,727 --> 01:10:28,690
[SPEAKER_07]: greater responsibility to those individuals when it's appropriate, they've got the institutional knowledge to demonstrate commitment to the district.

348
01:10:29,350 --> 01:10:29,450
[SPEAKER_07]: Ms.

349
01:10:29,470 --> 01:10:32,992
[SPEAKER_07]: Hines certainly an example of that with her promotion to the Director of Health Services position.

350
01:10:33,972 --> 01:10:48,459
[SPEAKER_07]: Retirements are something that we typically cover at the end of the year, even that there's some complexity because when we look at the composition of our retirements, we're looking at folks who retired in the previous fiscal year, but the position had not yet been filled, folks that have retired along

351
01:10:48,929 --> 01:10:53,110
[SPEAKER_07]: So the traditional educator cycle that leaves typically on June 30th.

352
01:10:53,530 --> 01:11:07,655
[SPEAKER_07]: And then some individuals who have identified their retirement date in the current fiscal year, but have not actually retired yet, but it's an important information to know because we're doing succession planning and things of that nature.

353
01:11:08,915 --> 01:11:18,498
[SPEAKER_07]: And then on the next page, the current postings, again, this is a really brief summary because that information really does change.

354
01:11:19,152 --> 01:11:28,695
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of the numbers that we had on Friday, as we were preparing this report are not even the numbers that we would have today again, particularly at the beginning of the school year you're going to see a lot of fluidity there, and so I think.

355
01:11:29,735 --> 01:11:35,616
[SPEAKER_07]: We later in the school year it'll be more it'll be easier to capture that information and convey it to you.

356
01:11:36,877 --> 01:11:41,558
[SPEAKER_07]: This is not the time to be providing accurate information because it's just changing so rapidly.

357
01:11:42,848 --> 01:11:47,311
[SPEAKER_07]: Coming into this fiscal year and this is a conversation that we had a little bit at the at the during the budget process.

358
01:11:48,492 --> 01:12:08,563
[SPEAKER_07]: We've looked at different, the different the structure of the business office and how positions may evolve or change over time and so right now we are looking at establishing a coordinator of human resources position to help leverage the organization's priorities towards some of the strategic staffing recruitment cultivation of diversity and things of that nature.

359
01:12:09,757 --> 01:12:17,249
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the general framing of how I would anticipate the report going again I would take the numbers and the specifics for this evening with a grain of salt.

360
01:12:18,153 --> 01:12:30,457
[SPEAKER_07]: But if there's other information that you think you would like to see in this report, I'd ask that you, you don't, we don't even necessarily need to discuss it now, but if you could send that to my attention, we can try to incorporate it into subsequent reports.

361
01:12:30,537 --> 01:12:38,079
[SPEAKER_07]: I will say the last point that I'll make, some of this information is obviously very sensitive and similar to some health data.

362
01:12:38,119 --> 01:12:46,042
[SPEAKER_07]: There's some information that if the committee is interested, we certainly want to provide as much information as possible, but some of it might be more appropriate in individual conversations than

363
01:12:46,842 --> 01:12:47,903
[SPEAKER_07]: discussion in a public forum.

364
01:12:47,983 --> 01:12:52,364
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not the case, certainly for the structure of the organization, how we're spending the money, things like that.

365
01:12:52,965 --> 01:12:59,627
[SPEAKER_07]: But there are some personnel matters that would obviously would not be, I think obviously would not be appropriate to be included in this type of report.

366
01:13:02,768 --> 01:13:03,549
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

367
01:13:03,749 --> 01:13:04,529
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

368
01:13:05,089 --> 01:13:05,710
[SPEAKER_12]: Looks great.

369
01:13:07,790 --> 01:13:09,111
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not just because it was short, right?

370
01:13:10,659 --> 01:13:11,640
[SPEAKER_12]: It was a great presentation.

371
01:13:11,660 --> 01:13:19,545
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought it would make sense to me and yeah, appropriate.

372
01:13:19,725 --> 01:13:20,005
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

373
01:13:20,065 --> 01:13:20,485
[SPEAKER_07]: Appreciate it.

374
01:13:21,346 --> 01:13:21,646
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

375
01:13:21,766 --> 01:13:22,167
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, ma'am.

376
01:13:22,507 --> 01:13:22,847
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

377
01:13:24,728 --> 01:13:36,496
[SPEAKER_12]: Presentations of the public not to begin for 7pm so we're good regular meetings of the school committee includes this presentations of public agenda item to give any resident the opportunity to place a presentation before the school committee.

378
01:13:37,251 --> 01:13:39,513
[SPEAKER_12]: A resident may only present once at any meeting.

379
01:13:39,573 --> 01:13:46,599
[SPEAKER_12]: These presentations are an opportunity for the public to make a presentation to the committee, but are not opportunities for dialogue with the committee.

380
01:13:46,679 --> 01:13:54,765
[SPEAKER_12]: If one or more members of the committee wishes to have a conversation about the topic presented, a member may request that the item be added to a subsequent regular meeting.

381
01:13:55,346 --> 01:14:03,032
[SPEAKER_12]: The details for submitting a presentation can be found within the policy BEDH public comment and presentations of the public.

382
01:14:03,833 --> 01:14:03,993
[SPEAKER_12]: None.

383
01:14:04,823 --> 01:14:30,518
[SPEAKER_12]: public comment pursuant do we have any more emails member van de gloot we do have an email shall i read okay that comes in a minute public comment pursuant to policy b-e-d-h public comment and presentations the public any resident in the audience may be given permission to speak once on any item on the agenda for up to three minutes the speaker is expected to keep their comments to the agenda item on the agenda the speaker must begin

384
01:14:31,305 --> 01:14:36,426
[SPEAKER_12]: Their comments providing their full name and full Medford Street address where they reside.

385
01:14:36,987 --> 01:14:48,270
[SPEAKER_12]: Residents may also submit their comments by writing to the superintendent of schools prior to the meeting or by emailing medfordsc.medford.k12.ma.us prior to or during the item on the agenda.

386
01:14:48,930 --> 01:14:57,072
[SPEAKER_12]: Written comments must be kept to a length that allows for them to be read into the record in less than three minutes or the comments will be summarized by the secretary of the school committee.

387
01:14:58,575 --> 01:15:04,836
[SPEAKER_12]: A welcoming inclusion community is both a value of the school committee and an aspirational goal.

388
01:15:04,916 --> 01:15:09,257
[SPEAKER_12]: We ask for your help in achieving this goal and value your perspective.

389
01:15:10,037 --> 01:15:23,040
[SPEAKER_12]: When writing or emailing, please provide this required information, the number and name of the item on the agenda, your first and last name, your Medford street address, where you reside, your question or comment.

390
01:15:23,540 --> 01:15:24,200
[SPEAKER_12]: Member Van de Kloop.

391
01:15:24,748 --> 01:15:29,952
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, this letter is from Cheryl Rodriguez of 281 Park Street.

392
01:15:30,372 --> 01:15:37,777
[SPEAKER_13]: She writes, hello, I'm writing concerned about the lack of a permanent crossing guard at the intersection of Riverside Ave and Freedom Way.

393
01:15:38,218 --> 01:15:44,542
[SPEAKER_13]: There are three schools that utilize that crosswalk, the McGlynn Elementary and Middle School and the Andrews Middle School.

394
01:15:45,142 --> 01:15:53,869
[SPEAKER_13]: I am grateful that the Medford police cross children there when they can, but understandably, they need to leave it if there is a call leaving no one to cross our children.

395
01:15:54,629 --> 01:16:12,553
[SPEAKER_13]: This is even more urgent as bus 11 formally dropped off at spring street and central lab was canceled for the middle school, and those children now have to walk without benefit of a crossing guard on that very busy street bus 11 was created because there were so many children on bus to that they could accommodate them all.

396
01:16:13,153 --> 01:16:16,154
[SPEAKER_13]: I am unsure of how many children lost bus service with this move.

397
01:16:16,614 --> 01:16:26,782
[SPEAKER_13]: likely inspired by the driver shortages, but the families received no notice and have added to the number of children likely unaccompanied that are crossing at the spot.

398
01:16:27,382 --> 01:16:32,186
[SPEAKER_13]: Please prioritize getting a crossing guard to this location immediately.

399
01:16:32,386 --> 01:16:33,887
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Cheryl Rodriguez.

400
01:16:35,245 --> 01:16:36,546
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, member Van de Kloet.

401
01:16:36,866 --> 01:16:46,913
[SPEAKER_12]: I do know I signed for two temporary crossing guards to become permanent, but that still puts us at a few that we need to hire for.

402
01:16:47,013 --> 01:16:52,197
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're working actively and I thank our police department for helping out whenever they can.

403
01:16:52,217 --> 01:16:58,882
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'll make sure I ask that they cover any spots that are not filled right now.

404
01:17:00,463 --> 01:17:01,404
[SPEAKER_12]: Continue to do that, yes.

405
01:17:05,435 --> 01:17:05,695
[SPEAKER_12]: That it?

406
01:17:06,076 --> 01:17:06,456
[SPEAKER_12]: That's it.

407
01:17:06,516 --> 01:17:06,736
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

408
01:17:07,597 --> 01:17:13,462
[SPEAKER_12]: We have continued business approval of the revised 2021-2022 school year calendar.

409
01:17:13,482 --> 01:17:18,166
[SPEAKER_10]: What's changed?

410
01:17:20,108 --> 01:17:21,449
[SPEAKER_12]: Member Rousseau?

411
01:17:22,090 --> 01:17:24,031
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm unclear what is revised.

412
01:17:28,575 --> 01:17:30,357
[SPEAKER_12]: Extra day we have in our calendar.

413
01:17:32,970 --> 01:17:34,912
[SPEAKER_12]: an extra day because we needed the 180?

414
01:17:58,476 --> 01:17:59,778
[SPEAKER_12]: Can people hear you on the Zoom?

415
01:17:59,818 --> 01:18:03,744
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I don't think people watching can, sorry, I'm not going to remember all that.

416
01:18:06,928 --> 01:18:07,809
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

417
01:18:08,090 --> 01:18:08,731
[SPEAKER_12]: Get your steps in.

418
01:18:09,693 --> 01:18:10,193
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.

419
01:18:11,034 --> 01:18:22,938
[SPEAKER_09]: So, the schedule this year, added the, the two holidays, and that caused an inadvertent hundred and 81st day in our calculations.

420
01:18:23,538 --> 01:18:29,981
[SPEAKER_09]: We also had March 23 if I remember correctly as a middle school high school half day early release.

421
01:18:31,041 --> 01:18:35,602
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, that conflicted with the high school administration and the statewide assessment MCAS.

422
01:18:36,242 --> 01:18:43,064
[SPEAKER_09]: So, uh, those two, um, errors and changes, however you want to look at it needed to be rectified.

423
01:18:43,584 --> 01:18:45,484
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, so we wanted to make sure that you had it before you.

424
01:18:46,425 --> 01:19:00,588
[SPEAKER_09]: So moving it March 23rd to March 30th and, uh, removing the extra day, which now puts us squarely at 180 days that have been hand counted and quadruple verified.

425
01:19:01,728 --> 01:19:02,048
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

426
01:19:02,068 --> 01:19:04,349
[SPEAKER_10]: So, the calendar before, if I may, sorry.

427
01:19:04,729 --> 01:19:05,449
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Rousseau.

428
01:19:05,569 --> 01:19:05,909
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

429
01:19:06,629 --> 01:19:13,950
[SPEAKER_10]: So the calendar that we have on the website at the moment has us actually going one day later than we will be going.

430
01:19:14,311 --> 01:19:14,671
[SPEAKER_09]: Correct.

431
01:19:14,851 --> 01:19:26,093
[SPEAKER_10]: I just, I just worry about parents that bought their tickets to hop on a plane the morning after which I mean, that's not me but I know some people are really planners like that so that's great.

432
01:19:28,170 --> 01:19:32,033
[SPEAKER_09]: That calendar will be removed once this one is approved.

433
01:19:32,893 --> 01:19:40,619
[SPEAKER_09]: And unless there are any snow days, we will not act present, we end on the Friday.

434
01:19:40,999 --> 01:19:41,780
[SPEAKER_10]: Great, thank you.

435
01:19:43,981 --> 01:19:47,003
[SPEAKER_12]: Motion to approve by member Graham, seconded by member McLaughlin.

436
01:19:47,023 --> 01:19:47,904

01:19:48,504 --> 01:19:49,345
