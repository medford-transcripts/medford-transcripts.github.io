49
00:03:48,316 --> 00:03:50,318
[SPEAKER_08]: This does not have a second, so it cannot be tabled.

00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:53,300
[SPEAKER_08]: Would anybody else like to speak on this matter?

51
00:03:55,879 --> 00:04:11,392
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, if I may, before we go any further, if my colleagues would not mind me speaking on this, I'd like to thank Councilor Marks for bringing this forward, especially in the interest of clarity and transparency.

52
00:04:12,312 --> 00:04:14,914
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd just like to mention that the role of the Council President

53
00:04:15,731 --> 00:04:21,172
[SPEAKER_08]: has taken on more responsibilities than ever before, especially over the past year during this pandemic.

54
00:04:22,133 --> 00:04:33,676
[SPEAKER_08]: And while I have very much enjoyed my two terms as council president and take a great deal of pride in fulfilling this role, I have decided not to pursue the presidency for another term.

55
00:04:34,516 --> 00:04:42,918
[SPEAKER_08]: I look forward to returning to the floor as an active participant, which will enable me to pursue the issues that mean a lot to our community,

56
00:04:43,923 --> 00:04:47,945
[SPEAKER_08]: And I look forward to working with the next Council President, whoever he or she may be.

57
00:04:48,405 --> 00:04:50,907
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just wanted to make that statement so everyone knows.

58
00:04:51,747 --> 00:04:57,170
[SPEAKER_08]: And if they decide that they want to pursue the presidency, they absolutely can and should.

59
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:01,552
[SPEAKER_08]: So on the motion of Council of Marks, seconded by Vice President Caraviello.

75
00:05:37,615 --> 00:05:38,415
[SPEAKER_08]: The motion passes.

76
00:05:42,044 --> 00:05:52,774
[SPEAKER_08]: 20-603 offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the DBW Commissioner provide the City Council with a cost estimate for resurfacing Boston Avenue between Route 16 and Route 60.

77
00:05:53,314 --> 00:05:53,795
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Knight.

78
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:55,736
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

79
00:05:56,217 --> 00:06:02,943
[SPEAKER_05]: As we're all aware, I think that it's safe to say the streets in the city of Medford are in some pretty bad condition, probably the worst we've seen in a bit of time.

80
00:06:03,741 --> 00:06:11,367
[SPEAKER_05]: And with that being said, we have to start somewhere, Mr. President, to determine how we're going to address the road surfaces in this community, the streets, the roads.

81
00:06:12,948 --> 00:06:20,694
[SPEAKER_05]: And in looking at certain areas in the community, I feel as though there are thoroughfares that are labeled emergency thoroughfares.

82
00:06:20,754 --> 00:06:26,298
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the meeting before this, they talked a lot about priority sidewalks and emergency roadways and connectivity.

83
00:06:26,918 --> 00:06:32,381
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it's very important, Mr. President, that we look at our emergency arteries as the main roadways here in the community.

84
00:06:33,001 --> 00:06:36,683
[SPEAKER_05]: The stretch of Boston Avenue being one of those emergency arteries.

85
00:06:37,143 --> 00:06:43,326
[SPEAKER_05]: And looking at what it's going to cost and what we need to do to begin to get a roadway resurfacing plan in place, Mr. President.

86
00:06:43,366 --> 00:06:46,288
[SPEAKER_05]: So I bring this paper forward to start a discussion.

87
00:06:46,768 --> 00:06:57,295
[SPEAKER_05]: about what it's going to take and what it's going to cost for us to start providing services in the form of local services, like sidewalks, streets, stumps, tree removal, and the like, Mr. President.

88
00:06:57,315 --> 00:06:58,876
[SPEAKER_05]: So with that being said, I offer this resolution.

89
00:06:58,896 --> 00:07:00,236
[SPEAKER_05]: I ask my council colleagues to support it.

90
00:07:00,797 --> 00:07:01,537
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

91
00:07:02,858 --> 00:07:04,559
[SPEAKER_08]: Would anybody else like to speak on this resolution?

[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

114
00:07:55,460 --> 00:08:06,592
[SPEAKER_02]: As we move forward and we're seeing the uptick with numbers and what we're hearing is that the state isn't really going to look going backwards at all.

115
00:08:07,152 --> 00:08:12,257
[SPEAKER_02]: As we move forward and we look at the issues of opening school and

116
00:08:14,102 --> 00:08:25,168
[SPEAKER_02]: opening of the city council for meetings that be interesting to know if there is money that's still needed to the school system and what type of money they've used moving forward.

117
00:08:25,228 --> 00:08:32,932
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, and to see if there's, if there's need that we need to address as a council to move some initiatives forward.

118
00:08:32,972 --> 00:08:38,516
[SPEAKER_02]: So I put that out as a resolution and hopefully my colleagues agree.

124
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:50,893

125
00:08:51,353 --> 00:08:58,817
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I think that's becoming even more important as the stimulus talks and the federal government are talking about being able to use this money for a broader range of purposes.

126
00:08:58,857 --> 00:09:02,319
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's important that we know how much is there and still remains.

00:09:46,411 --> 00:09:47,192
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Scarpelli.

149
00:09:47,352 --> 00:09:48,193
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

150
00:09:49,174 --> 00:09:58,122
[SPEAKER_02]: As we get closer, we see the unbelievable completion of that beautiful building, our police station, and something we should be very proud of.

151
00:09:59,183 --> 00:10:11,093
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, it poses a bigger issue once that building is open and the crosswalk where we've been talking about.

152
00:10:12,975 --> 00:10:15,958
[SPEAKER_02]: between south and main issues now with the police station.

153
00:10:17,138 --> 00:10:23,724
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be interesting to see what type of plan we have in place, or is there any part of discussion about putting in?

154
00:10:23,744 --> 00:10:30,009
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that what was discussed in the past were the rhino lights, the temporary crossing lights that could be installed.

155
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:31,830
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if that's going to happen.

156
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:38,596
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it was mentioned, and I know that we did call for a meeting, hopefully, talking to Representative Donato.

157
00:10:38,976 --> 00:10:40,578
[SPEAKER_02]: We're trying to get something for next week.

158
00:10:41,598 --> 00:10:52,864
[SPEAKER_02]: for next Tuesday at 530 just to discuss the top, one of the top 200 most dangerous intersections in the Commonwealth, Maine and South.

159
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:56,665
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that we have some money coming from the state and the state DOT now

160
00:10:58,406 --> 00:11:04,209
[SPEAKER_02]: agrees that this is one of the most dangerous intersections, and we need to move forward as soon as possible.

161
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:15,455
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, with that conversation, to reiterate what I talked about last week, putting in the raised crosswalks as soon as possible to see how that can slow that traffic down.

162
00:11:15,535 --> 00:11:24,800
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm hoping we get some answers, and we move forward in a positive light.

163
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:25,321
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you.

164
00:11:25,641 --> 00:11:26,862
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

165
00:11:26,882 --> 00:11:27,542
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Bears?

166
00:11:28,513 --> 00:11:29,313
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. President.

167
00:11:29,373 --> 00:11:32,114
[SPEAKER_01]: I think councilor Scarpelli basically answered my question.

168
00:11:32,134 --> 00:11:40,535
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but is this would be part of the conversations around the main and South redesign or are you trying to get something in there prior to that happening?

169
00:11:41,275 --> 00:11:49,457
[SPEAKER_02]: The hope is that the discussion tonight with this resolution, with the traffic engineer being part of that meeting next week, that'll be something we could draw out all at once.

170
00:11:49,497 --> 00:11:52,097
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't want to delay anything else as we're moving forward.

171
00:11:52,137 --> 00:11:52,957
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you.

172
00:11:53,097 --> 00:11:53,417
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

173
00:11:53,437 --> 00:11:53,898
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

174
00:11:53,938 --> 00:11:54,558
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Bears.

175
00:11:55,018 --> 00:11:56,478
[SPEAKER_08]: Any other questions, comments from the council?

176
00:11:58,012 --> 00:11:59,593
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, seeing and hearing none.

177
00:11:59,973 --> 00:12:03,456
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Bears.

178

[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

187
00:12:15,966 --> 00:12:17,907
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Morell is absent.

188

189
00:12:18,828 --> 00:12:19,068
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

190
00:12:19,908 --> 00:12:20,229
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:22,651

193

[SPEAKER_08]: The motion passes.

195
00:12:35,057 --> 00:12:44,263
[SPEAKER_08]: 20606, October 8th, 2020, to Brianna Lugo, current mayor, from Kimberly M. Scanlon, city solicitor, regarding council paper 20-476.

196
00:12:48,292 --> 00:13:00,242
[SPEAKER_08]: Dear Mayor Lungo-Koehn, on October 8th, 2020, the Medford City Council have made a request to include a 3% tax in the draft Cannabis Advisory Committee Ordinance.

197
00:13:01,023 --> 00:13:13,814
[SPEAKER_08]: However, since General Law Chapter 64N, Section 3 is a local option statute, the preferred method is for the Council to accept the provisions of the statute pursuant to General Law Chapter 4, Section 4.

198
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:18,076
[SPEAKER_08]: For convenience purposes, I have included the following format below.

199
00:13:18,936 --> 00:13:36,762
[SPEAKER_08]: Be it resolved that the City of Medford, through its City Council, accept the provisions of General Law, Chapter 64N, Section 3, and impose a local excise tax on the sale or transfer of marijuana products for adult use to anyone other than a marijuana establishment at a rate of 3%.

200
00:13:38,002 --> 00:13:41,043
[SPEAKER_08]: Respectfully submitted, Kimberly M. Scanlon, City Solicitor.

201
00:13:42,224 --> 00:13:43,064
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to adopt.

202
00:13:44,195 --> 00:13:55,383
[SPEAKER_05]: the provisions of general law chapter 64 and section three and impose a local excise tax on the sale or transfer of marijuana products for adult use to anyone other than a marijuana establishment at a rate of 3%, Mr. President.

203
00:13:55,783 --> 00:13:56,143
[SPEAKER_05]: Second.

204
00:13:56,884 --> 00:14:01,327
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion of council night, seconded by Vice President Caraviello.

205
00:14:02,228 --> 00:14:04,029
[SPEAKER_08]: Any questions from the council or comments?

206
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:06,090
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyone have the hand up?

207
00:14:06,571 --> 00:14:06,731
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

208
00:14:06,751 --> 00:14:11,514
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, on the motion of council night, seconded by Vice President Caraviello.

209
00:14:11,534 --> 00:14:12,655

00:14:15,337 --> 00:14:16,317
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice President Caraviello.

213
00:14:16,377 --> 00:14:16,637
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

00:14:17,597 --> 00:14:18,098

00:14:19,138 --> 00:14:19,698
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Marks.

217
00:14:19,918 --> 00:14:20,278

[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:26,140
[SPEAKER_10]: President Falco.

222
00:14:26,521 --> 00:14:26,721
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

223
00:14:26,781 --> 00:14:30,442
[SPEAKER_08]: Six in the affirmative, zero in the negative, one absent, the motion passes.

224
00:14:32,381 --> 00:14:52,126
[SPEAKER_08]: Communications from the Mayor 20-607 to the Honorable President and members of the Medford City Council, City Hall, Medford, Massachusetts 02155, dear Mr. President and city councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approves the appropriation from the TNC surcharge municipal distribution receipts reserved account.

225
00:14:54,087 --> 00:14:54,988
[SPEAKER_08]: 124-102-5840-0000-0000-113-0000-0000 in the amount of $136,129.20.

226
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:21,471
[SPEAKER_08]: In accordance with Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 187 of Acts of 2016 to cover transportation related projects and improvements.

227
00:15:22,131 --> 00:15:28,275
[SPEAKER_08]: A detailed list of anticipated projects and improvements is attached here too as Appendix A.

228
00:15:29,497 --> 00:15:35,342
[SPEAKER_08]: The prepared list does not include emergency improvements that may arise and utilize the fund balance of this account.

229
00:15:36,042 --> 00:15:41,126
[SPEAKER_08]: Traffic engineer, Todd Blake, is present to answer any of the council's questions regarding this matter.

230
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:43,729
[SPEAKER_08]: Sincerely, Breanna Lungo-Koehn, Mayor.

231
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:46,711
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Bears.

232
00:15:47,992 --> 00:15:48,793
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. President.

233
00:15:48,813 --> 00:15:59,021
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just wondering if a representative of the administration could tell us how much is in the TNC, the TNC surcharge municipal distribution receipts reserved account.

234
00:15:59,611 --> 00:16:03,715
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe we have Aleesha Nunley-Benjamin with us, so she could probably talk to that.

235
00:16:03,855 --> 00:16:05,497
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to unmute you, Aleesha.

236
00:16:05,517 --> 00:16:08,760
[SPEAKER_07]: Aleesha, did you have a question for Councilor Bears?

237
00:16:10,281 --> 00:16:10,502
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

238
00:16:10,722 --> 00:16:12,624
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening, Honorable City Councilors.

239
00:16:13,244 --> 00:16:13,745
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me look.

240
00:16:14,285 --> 00:16:19,931
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now in the TMC fund, we had a balance of $161,519.75.

241
00:16:26,204 --> 00:16:28,064
[SPEAKER_01]: And how?

242
00:16:28,385 --> 00:16:30,165
[SPEAKER_06]: We spent $103,532.80 in fiscal 20.

243
00:16:30,445 --> 00:16:40,347
[SPEAKER_06]: And then in June, our next T&C, which you are programming tonight, came in at $136,129.20.

244
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:41,988
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.

245
00:16:42,128 --> 00:16:42,448
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

246
00:16:45,448 --> 00:16:46,989
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Knight, did you have a question?

247
00:16:47,529 --> 00:16:48,369
[SPEAKER_05]: I did, Mr. President.

248
00:16:49,781 --> 00:16:57,983
[SPEAKER_05]: I do believe that this council during budget time requested that we'd have a quarterly meeting relative to where we were with forecasts and receipts.

249
00:16:58,523 --> 00:17:08,405
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the council did vote on a resolution asking that this meeting take place relative to the state of the city's finances for the second Tuesday in October.

250
00:17:09,385 --> 00:17:10,205
[SPEAKER_05]: That never happened.

251
00:17:11,465 --> 00:17:14,446
[SPEAKER_05]: And here we are this evening with a request for appropriation before us, Mr. President.

252
00:17:15,727 --> 00:17:21,615
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, I know that these funds are through the surcharges around those Uber and Lyft rides that originate in the community.

253
00:17:22,377 --> 00:17:28,545
[SPEAKER_05]: And looking at the appendix that's attached, I certainly see no issue with the appropriations.

254
00:17:28,605 --> 00:17:29,527
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to see them maybe

255
00:17:30,256 --> 00:17:33,178
[SPEAKER_05]: distributed a little bit more equitably across the community.

256
00:17:34,379 --> 00:17:42,525
[SPEAKER_05]: However, I feel as though it's important, Mr. President, that we sit down and schedule a time for us to talk about the state of our finances here in this community.

257
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:47,128
[SPEAKER_05]: During the budget, we were talking about a fiscal crisis.

258
00:17:47,188 --> 00:17:52,512
[SPEAKER_05]: We took $5.5 million from our reserves and we appropriated that much money from our reserves to balance the budget.

259
00:17:53,673 --> 00:17:55,354
[SPEAKER_05]: The question is, are we doing better now?

260
00:17:56,698 --> 00:18:04,854
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we have the ability to restore some of those funds back to our reserves if our forecasts are showing that our receipts are up well above anticipated returns?

261
00:18:05,635 --> 00:18:07,378
[SPEAKER_05]: So Mr. President, it was very important.

262
00:18:08,191 --> 00:18:17,778
[SPEAKER_05]: discussion that took place during the budget, and this was one of the items that came out of that, was that we'd meet quarterly to determine what the current and ongoing state of fiscal affairs is in this community.

263
00:18:18,358 --> 00:18:19,839
[SPEAKER_05]: And that needs to happen, Mr. President.

264
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:27,464
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have a paper before us asking us to appropriate $136,000, but we still haven't had that meeting to recap the last quarter.

265
00:18:28,425 --> 00:18:35,150
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's concerning to me, Mr. President, and I'm hoping that the finance director would be able to coordinate with you.

266
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:39,233
[SPEAKER_05]: to determine a time where we'll be able to do that before the next quarter is over.

267
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:44,177
[SPEAKER_05]: So with that being said, here we are almost one month into the next quarter, Mr. President.

268
00:18:45,098 --> 00:18:52,764
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're going to get a skewed perspective of what's going on if we don't meet as close to the close of the quarter as possible.

269
00:18:53,444 --> 00:18:55,726
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'd ask that that meeting be scheduled.

270
00:18:55,746 --> 00:19:01,450
[SPEAKER_08]: If I'm correct, you wanted that during the regular session, right?

271
00:19:01,951 --> 00:19:03,712
[SPEAKER_05]: I did want it during the regular session, yes, Mr. President.

272
00:19:06,636 --> 00:19:18,323
[SPEAKER_05]: If this was a free cash appropriation, I'd be much more concerned about taking a vote this evening on it, but where it's coming from a dedicated accountant that has a dedicated purpose, that's another thing.

273
00:19:18,383 --> 00:19:24,907
[SPEAKER_05]: So that being said, Mr. President, this will be the last money paper I vote on until we have that quarterly meeting.

274
00:19:25,688 --> 00:19:27,529
[SPEAKER_05]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I rest my case.

275
00:19:27,889 --> 00:19:28,690
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Constant.

276
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:29,610
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll get that scheduled.

277
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:32,572
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll reach out to Aleesha tomorrow, and we'll get that scheduled.

278
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:36,827
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, do we have?

279
00:19:36,887 --> 00:19:38,428
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have the city engineer on?

280
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:45,870
[SPEAKER_08]: I do not see, you want the traffic engineer, right?

281
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:49,551
[SPEAKER_08]: Traffic engineer, city engineer, anyone at all.

282
00:19:49,611 --> 00:19:52,332
[SPEAKER_06]: Todd Blake is on.

283
00:19:52,452 --> 00:19:52,772
[SPEAKER_06]: Is he here?

284
00:19:52,852 --> 00:19:53,372
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, let me see.

285
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,041
[SPEAKER_02]: have the traffic engineer on.

286
00:20:00,061 --> 00:20:03,083
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you just give us a brief

287
00:20:27,844 --> 00:20:38,232
[SPEAKER_04]: We're proposing a radar feedback sign in North Medford on Fells Ave as the steep part going downhill.

288
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:48,701
[SPEAKER_04]: We're proposing a pedestrian warning flashing sign on Fulton Street near Watson Street in the Heights.

289
00:20:49,601 --> 00:20:55,406
[SPEAKER_04]: We're proposing in the Wellington area on Bradbury Ave at 2nd Street, flashing stop sign.

290
00:20:55,905 --> 00:20:59,706
[SPEAKER_04]: in the hillside area in the north at Capon, a flashing stop sign.

291
00:21:01,386 --> 00:21:03,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I'll jump to the bottom of the list.

292
00:21:04,347 --> 00:21:17,050
[SPEAKER_04]: In East Metro Glenwood area, we're proposing a Salem at Hadley to be a flex post design, painted bump outs to try to address some safety concerns there.

293
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:18,731
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there,

294
00:21:20,248 --> 00:21:30,591
[SPEAKER_04]: Five others that are taken from the 2016 Complete Streets Top 20 Prioritized List that are still not complete.

295
00:21:30,671 --> 00:21:34,732
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're trying to address some of those to get them off that list.

296
00:21:35,613 --> 00:21:37,693
[SPEAKER_04]: One is in South Medford at Main Street.

297
00:21:38,713 --> 00:21:43,295
[SPEAKER_04]: On Main Street at Frederick Ave, most of it includes new wheelchair ramps.

298
00:21:44,235 --> 00:21:46,956
[SPEAKER_04]: West Medford Place that road at Irving Street.

299
00:21:47,876 --> 00:21:56,120
[SPEAKER_04]: Same thing, new wheelchair ramps, South Medford, Main Street at Stearns Ave, crossing Main, wheelchair ramps.

300
00:21:56,841 --> 00:22:02,383
[SPEAKER_04]: West Medford, Sharon Street at Fairfield Street, same thing, wheelchair ramps.

301
00:22:02,603 --> 00:22:12,989
[SPEAKER_04]: And then also in the Lawrence Estates, North slash Central Medford on Ford Street at Webster and Cedar.

302
00:22:13,329 --> 00:22:17,091
[SPEAKER_04]: There has been some work done there in the past related to a paving job,

303
00:22:18,585 --> 00:22:21,806
[SPEAKER_04]: complete the rest of what's outlined in the 2016 top 20?

304
00:22:26,687 --> 00:22:37,430
[SPEAKER_09]: So, Mr. President, if I could, just because this has been a longstanding issue with this council, it predates Todd.

305
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:45,632
[SPEAKER_09]: But Todd, many years back, this council voted to implement a pilot program for raised crosswalks.

306
00:22:46,585 --> 00:22:51,752
[SPEAKER_09]: And at the time, three of them were recognized by the city under a previous administration.

307
00:22:53,194 --> 00:23:03,668
[SPEAKER_09]: One out of the three was initiated on Winthrop Street, Central Ave, and Harvard Street have yet to get their raised crosswalk.

308
00:23:04,329 --> 00:23:16,573
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that something that's being looked at or can we assume now that it's been several years that that is not being reviewed and no longer is part of the commitment that was made by a previous administration?

309
00:23:19,493 --> 00:23:31,697
[SPEAKER_04]: As you said, that predates me, but I could say that obviously the Winter Street one is there and the two others, you know, they're on a long list of which includes this complete streets list.

310
00:23:32,441 --> 00:23:46,586
[SPEAKER_04]: And in the past we've selected from previous council papers, as well as safety concerns received by various city staff, various city departments.

311
00:23:46,606 --> 00:24:01,612
[SPEAKER_04]: So I couldn't say what the status is of those two that you're speaking of, but I will say in the two years past and this year as well, we're trying to, with this particular money, we're trying to spread it out as much as we can.

312
00:24:02,618 --> 00:24:10,843
[SPEAKER_04]: and get, you know, choose somewhat strategically in the sense of how much per, so we could get more locations.

313
00:24:11,924 --> 00:24:23,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Something like just an order of magnitude for a raised crosswalk in the similar fashion as Winthrop Street costs at that time about $50,000.

314
00:24:25,256 --> 00:24:26,697
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm told, I wasn't here.

315
00:24:27,078 --> 00:24:31,862
[SPEAKER_04]: So something like that, you'd be able to get maybe two of those with this money.

316
00:24:31,922 --> 00:24:35,426
[SPEAKER_04]: So just to give you an idea, in years past, we've gotten about 25 locations.

317
00:24:35,506 --> 00:24:37,648
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that help?

318
00:24:38,489 --> 00:24:45,716
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't necessarily address exactly what you're saying, but there are many lists that we try to go off of.

319
00:24:45,776 --> 00:24:49,960
[SPEAKER_04]: And there are some of these crosswalks coming as part of the Eversource MOU agreement.

320
00:24:51,175 --> 00:24:58,118
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, and I realize when city administrations change, there may be a different direction in communities.

321
00:24:58,659 --> 00:25:13,166
[SPEAKER_09]: However, when residents are promised certain items to happen, especially with traffic coming in their neighborhoods, they don't look at it and say, now we have a new mayor, there's a new direction, and we're not going to get the raised crosswalk we were promised under the last mayor.

322
00:25:13,946 --> 00:25:15,407
[SPEAKER_09]: because now there's a different direction.

323
00:25:16,167 --> 00:25:17,728
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think residents see it that way.

324
00:25:18,088 --> 00:25:22,470
[SPEAKER_09]: They would hope that commitments are kept from administration to administration.

325
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:29,073
[SPEAKER_09]: And when you have a pilot program, at some point, a pilot program is supposed to have an end date.

326
00:25:29,733 --> 00:25:42,119
[SPEAKER_09]: So you're supposed to review how successful the pilot was and either decide to move on with other race crosswalks or decide that they're not useful and don't provide the safety that we need in the community.

327
00:25:42,699 --> 00:25:47,242
[SPEAKER_09]: But either way, at some point, I think we have to put this issue to rest.

328
00:25:47,722 --> 00:25:55,687
[SPEAKER_09]: And now you're the traffic engineer, and if indeed these other two areas, Central Ave, I get calls all the time about speeding cars.

329
00:25:56,047 --> 00:25:58,368
[SPEAKER_09]: I think all my colleagues can attest to that.

330
00:25:58,788 --> 00:26:02,090
[SPEAKER_09]: This was an ideal place for a raised crosswalk.

331
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:04,131
[SPEAKER_09]: I can appreciate the expense.

332
00:26:04,692 --> 00:26:11,956
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember on Ring Road when they put that blinking crosswalk that looked like airplane traffic lights.

333
00:26:13,057 --> 00:26:20,522
[SPEAKER_09]: on ring road, that cost about $46,000 to put that on ring road.

334
00:26:20,902 --> 00:26:25,825
[SPEAKER_09]: And I would say within the first six months, it stopped working and it hasn't worked since.

335
00:26:26,446 --> 00:26:32,730
[SPEAKER_09]: So talk about putting good money after bad money into something that is no longer even in effect.

336
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:36,792
[SPEAKER_09]: At least the winter street race crosswalk is still serving a purpose.

337
00:26:37,313 --> 00:26:41,916
[SPEAKER_09]: I would respectfully ask as part of this paper, and I have no problem supporting this paper,

338
00:26:42,436 --> 00:26:54,083
[SPEAKER_09]: that the city administration respond back, Mr. President, on where do we stand with the raised crosswalks on Central Ave and Harvard Street, the commitment that was made several years back.

339
00:26:54,723 --> 00:26:58,165
[SPEAKER_09]: And if it's no longer a commitment, I'm a big boy, just let me know.

340
00:26:59,706 --> 00:27:04,489
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'll fight for something else, or I'll fight to see if we can get those once again to become a commitment.

341
00:27:04,929 --> 00:27:08,491
[SPEAKER_09]: But just to leave them hanging, leave residents hanging that were promised.

342
00:27:09,568 --> 00:27:13,270
[SPEAKER_09]: These were promised, these were articles in the paper, discussion among the council.

343
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:23,956
[SPEAKER_09]: These were things that were open and notorious, and then just to forget about them like nothing's going on, doesn't, in disservice to this community and the residents.

344
00:27:24,356 --> 00:27:29,379
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's what gives government a bad name, Mr. President, when things get forgotten about.

345
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,801
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm not going to forget about these, Mr. President.

346
00:27:32,361 --> 00:27:36,742
[SPEAKER_09]: So if it's no longer a commitment of this administration, just let us know.

347
00:27:36,802 --> 00:27:43,463
[SPEAKER_09]: So Todd, if you can take that back to the city administration, and if it's not a commitment, then just let us know.

348
00:27:44,863 --> 00:27:47,864
[SPEAKER_09]: But if it is a commitment, then these two are a priority.

349
00:27:48,664 --> 00:27:55,346
[SPEAKER_09]: Residents have been waiting four to five years on these, and we have to come out whether or not the pilot program is successful or not.

350
00:27:55,666 --> 00:27:56,926
[SPEAKER_09]: And my idea,

351
00:27:58,367 --> 00:27:59,667
[SPEAKER_09]: This is not something novel.

352
00:27:59,707 --> 00:28:02,089
[SPEAKER_09]: This is being done in many other communities.

353
00:28:02,449 --> 00:28:07,311
[SPEAKER_09]: A raised crosswalk puts you at a higher height, at a level with oncoming traffic.

354
00:28:08,032 --> 00:28:08,952
[SPEAKER_09]: They're very,

355
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:18,774
[SPEAKER_09]: From a distance you can see them, they're very visually pleasing from a distance.

356
00:28:19,194 --> 00:28:27,600
[SPEAKER_09]: And they do provide safety in areas that we know are highly traveled and high rates of speed on those streets.

357
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:37,186
[SPEAKER_09]: And if it provides safety for the community, whether it's $5 or $50,000, we just talked about shoveling sidewalks and creating a new ordinance.

358
00:28:37,626 --> 00:28:40,167
[SPEAKER_09]: It's worth every penny, in my opinion.

359
00:28:40,688 --> 00:28:50,254
[SPEAKER_09]: I know we want to make it look like we're everywhere in the community and putting these blinking signs up, which I may add, Mr. President, go by any blinking light.

360
00:28:51,244 --> 00:28:54,125
[SPEAKER_09]: And let me tell you, half the side's not blinking.

361
00:28:54,205 --> 00:28:55,065
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of it's blinking.

362
00:28:55,085 --> 00:28:55,785
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of it's not.

363
00:28:56,165 --> 00:28:57,346
[SPEAKER_09]: But these are pretty new.

364
00:28:57,666 --> 00:28:59,086
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't know if the city goes around.

365
00:28:59,606 --> 00:29:01,307
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of them are malfunctioning.

366
00:29:01,607 --> 00:29:02,447
[SPEAKER_09]: Or they're not working.

367
00:29:02,507 --> 00:29:03,408
[SPEAKER_09]: Or they're cheaper ones.

368
00:29:03,448 --> 00:29:04,168
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

369
00:29:04,208 --> 00:29:05,788
[SPEAKER_09]: But they're not working.

370
00:29:05,808 --> 00:29:07,549
[SPEAKER_09]: They're not serving their intended purpose.

371
00:29:08,089 --> 00:29:10,770
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would ask that the

372
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:15,351
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is no reflection, again, on the city and traffic engineer.

373
00:29:15,371 --> 00:29:17,172
[SPEAKER_09]: I think he's doing a tremendous job.

374
00:29:17,232 --> 00:29:20,612
[SPEAKER_09]: But there has to be more follow-up in this community, Mr. President.

375
00:29:20,993 --> 00:29:40,798
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would ask, in the form of a motion, that we get an update on the two crosswalks, Central Ave and Harvard Street, whether there's still a commitment in the time frame, and that the other blinking lights that are throughout the community that were recently put in, that the city go around and audit them to see why a lot of them are malfunctioning.

376
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:42,550
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

377
00:29:42,711 --> 00:29:48,313
[SPEAKER_08]: Clerk Bernabez, do you have the language to that motion that was offered by Councilor Marks?

378
00:29:49,934 --> 00:29:53,376
[SPEAKER_10]: I have everything except the audit on the blinking lights.

379
00:29:55,737 --> 00:29:56,377
[SPEAKER_10]: Hang on just a second.

380
00:29:56,897 --> 00:29:57,578
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll read it back.

381
00:30:01,219 --> 00:30:04,301
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Marks, do you want to make that a beat paper?

382
00:30:04,861 --> 00:30:05,741
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll make that a beat paper.

383
00:30:06,622 --> 00:30:06,842
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

384
00:30:08,141 --> 00:30:20,910
[SPEAKER_10]: What I have is a request that the administration respond back on where we stand on raised crosswalks on Central Avenue and Harvard Street, and a request that the city audit the blinking lights that were recently installed.

385
00:30:22,611 --> 00:30:26,054
[SPEAKER_09]: If we could just add language on the commitment for raised crosswalks.

386
00:30:27,315 --> 00:30:35,561
[SPEAKER_09]: I know I said a lot of stuff, but that's important because that was a commitment made by a previous administration, and that should be honored.

387
00:30:36,274 --> 00:30:36,514
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

388
00:30:36,894 --> 00:30:37,174
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

389
00:30:37,294 --> 00:30:46,717
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to respond back on where we stand on the commitment for raised crosswalks on Central Avenue and Harvard Street, and that the city audit the blinking lights that were recently installed.

390
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:47,978
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. Clerk.

391
00:30:48,798 --> 00:30:49,118
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

392
00:30:49,298 --> 00:30:50,038
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. Clerk.

393
00:30:50,259 --> 00:30:52,139
[SPEAKER_08]: On that- That is a B paper.

394
00:30:52,179 --> 00:30:52,939
[SPEAKER_08]: That is a B paper.

395
00:30:52,959 --> 00:30:56,401
[SPEAKER_08]: On that B paper offered by Councilor Marks, seconded by Vice President Caraviello.

396
00:30:56,541 --> 00:30:57,521
[SPEAKER_08]: Vice President Caraviello.

397
00:30:57,981 --> 00:30:58,641
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

398
00:30:58,942 --> 00:31:02,844
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, I want to thank Councilor Marks for bringing those two crosswalks up.

399
00:31:02,924 --> 00:31:06,146
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I was by that council that had been waiting for that.

400
00:31:06,666 --> 00:31:11,629
[SPEAKER_03]: And our current mayor was by the council who was very supportive of those.

401
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:13,630
[SPEAKER_03]: So Councilor Marks is right.

402
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:14,931
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, where are we with those?

403
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:20,014
[SPEAKER_03]: You just can't forget about it, make a promise and forget about it, no matter who's in charge.

404
00:31:20,314 --> 00:31:21,835
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd like to see those two.

405
00:31:22,475 --> 00:31:23,415
[SPEAKER_03]: comes to fruition there.

406
00:31:23,596 --> 00:31:25,056
[SPEAKER_03]: They're both heavily traveled streets.

407
00:31:25,656 --> 00:31:26,337
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, he's right.

408
00:31:26,417 --> 00:31:27,737
[SPEAKER_03]: We're always getting calls.

409
00:31:27,797 --> 00:31:35,541
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, getting emails from the Harvest Street people about the traffic going up and down there.

410
00:31:35,801 --> 00:31:40,063
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd like to thank you for bringing that up.

411
00:31:40,823 --> 00:31:44,225
[SPEAKER_03]: But I have a question for Aleesha and Benjamin.

412
00:31:44,525 --> 00:31:45,365
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, Aleesha.

413
00:31:45,925 --> 00:31:46,886
[SPEAKER_08]: He's still there to the chair?

414
00:31:46,906 --> 00:31:47,626
[SPEAKER_08]: She is here with us.

415
00:31:47,846 --> 00:31:49,407
[SPEAKER_08]: Vice President Caraviello, please continue.

416
00:31:50,131 --> 00:31:57,294
[SPEAKER_03]: Aleesha, the money that we're appropriating, is that money from the first payment of the TNC, or is that new money?

417
00:31:58,654 --> 00:31:59,314
[SPEAKER_06]: That's new money.

418
00:31:59,474 --> 00:32:04,276
[SPEAKER_06]: We get new money every June from the TNC that has to be programmed, and then I give a report.

419
00:32:04,416 --> 00:32:06,397
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we up or down from last year on that number?

420
00:32:09,698 --> 00:32:11,099
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd have to compare that to that.

421
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:12,539
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was a little higher last year.

422
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:14,740
[SPEAKER_03]: It might have been a little higher.

423
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:19,162
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think with the COVID, the ride shares might have suffered a little bit too.

424
00:32:20,373 --> 00:32:23,936
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I was just checking, I wasn't sure if we were still using last year's money.

425
00:32:24,216 --> 00:32:27,218
[SPEAKER_03]: Did we expend all the money from the last payment?

426
00:32:28,639 --> 00:32:29,480
[SPEAKER_03]: Almost all of it.

427
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,220
[SPEAKER_03]: Almost all of it.

428
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,301
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, thank you.

429
00:32:32,342 --> 00:32:33,562
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Vice President Caraviello.

430
00:32:34,163 --> 00:32:34,923
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilman Scott Kelly.

431
00:32:36,445 --> 00:32:37,185
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

432
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:42,429
[SPEAKER_02]: First, let me thank Councilman Knight for bringing up a very major point, a very important point.

433
00:32:42,489 --> 00:32:46,692
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that what we're hearing from the state and what's being talked about,

434
00:32:49,397 --> 00:32:54,584
[SPEAKER_02]: the fiscal damage that we're going to see in a year is going to be pretty damaging.

435
00:32:55,125 --> 00:33:05,739
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's important that the request that he put forth a while ago that we do meet and really understand where we are, especially with the

436
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:15,044
[SPEAKER_02]: the free cash and where we stand with that, and where we stand with our taxes and our collections and stuff.

437
00:33:15,064 --> 00:33:21,587
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's important that we have an idea of where we are as we move forward, because let's not make this a secret.

438
00:33:22,327 --> 00:33:24,748
[SPEAKER_02]: Things are going to get really, really, really tough soon.

439
00:33:25,369 --> 00:33:32,052
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to have to make some hard decisions if we're not going to get the support that we need, both in the state and the federal side.

440
00:33:32,112 --> 00:33:33,992
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's very important.

441
00:33:35,493 --> 00:33:36,495
[SPEAKER_02]: Second, I know that.

442
00:33:40,339 --> 00:33:42,180
[SPEAKER_02]: We're looking at the raised crosswalks.

443
00:33:43,381 --> 00:33:52,467
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great question, and it's something that was a great solution for the Central Ave location with Morrison-Parkes.

444
00:33:53,107 --> 00:33:58,271
[SPEAKER_02]: Because before that pilot program, it was just a speedway.

445
00:33:58,811 --> 00:34:08,277
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it made a huge difference, being on the school committee back then, that that was one of the huge concern with the kids in the neighborhood, and the bus stops, and so on.

446
00:34:11,626 --> 00:34:13,888
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a huge concern.

447
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:24,496
[SPEAKER_02]: But you see in neighbor communities, I know Todd might be familiar with it, I know that on Powder House Boulevard, there was an awful accident and a pedestrian death there.

448
00:34:24,936 --> 00:34:26,818
[SPEAKER_02]: And what they did there is they didn't put

449
00:34:27,618 --> 00:34:33,704
[SPEAKER_02]: a raised sidewalk, but they put a raised roadway with arrows depicting the rise.

450
00:34:34,365 --> 00:34:37,648
[SPEAKER_02]: And it really slows that traffic down in front of that school.

451
00:34:38,289 --> 00:34:47,357
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can't see that being a major cost where it's actually, it was put into place very, very quickly.

452
00:34:47,858 --> 00:34:50,360
[SPEAKER_02]: There were no decorative blocks, but there is

453
00:34:51,494 --> 00:34:55,257
[SPEAKER_02]: a clear rise that slows down that area.

454
00:34:56,037 --> 00:35:07,726
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that if we can look into that, Todd, I'd love to get an idea if we can even possibly do that in some of the locations, including South Street, Main Street, as we're waiting for

455
00:35:09,146 --> 00:35:16,090
[SPEAKER_02]: get through and see what they can do, but I'm just afraid we're going to get to a situation where there's going to be a death in one of these areas.

456
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:21,312
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to be telling each other, we told you so.

457
00:35:21,733 --> 00:35:22,773
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't want that.

458
00:35:22,873 --> 00:35:26,435
[SPEAKER_02]: So if there's a way that we can look into that and look at some of this money because

459
00:35:27,802 --> 00:35:31,024
[SPEAKER_02]: I need some clarity on what we're seeing around the neighborhoods.

460
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:37,228
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know it might be like the 3,000, the 4,000, 5,000 hits with this.

461
00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:43,892
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you do it 15 times in the community, it's $50,000.

462
00:35:45,173 --> 00:35:48,155
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's something that looks temporary all over the city.

463
00:35:48,635 --> 00:35:56,921
[SPEAKER_02]: We have light white paint around intersection streets with these white

464
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,001
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not cones, they're just sticks.

465
00:36:01,761 --> 00:36:07,384
[SPEAKER_02]: And within the first week that I saw them, especially in South Medford, they were knocked over immediately.

466
00:36:08,505 --> 00:36:10,006
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you explain, is that temporary?

467
00:36:10,146 --> 00:36:19,691
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that, how are we going to deal with that when it comes to, the question I had with the raised sidewalk at South and Main during the winter was, well, with plowing, we can't do that.

468
00:36:19,751 --> 00:36:25,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, with all these sticks all over the place, how are we going to manage that area in that situation?

469
00:36:27,366 --> 00:36:30,329
[SPEAKER_08]: Todd, would you like to answer Councilor Scarpelli's question, please?

470
00:36:31,089 --> 00:36:33,071
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a great point, Councilor.

471
00:36:34,072 --> 00:36:52,728
[SPEAKER_04]: So the idea of a lot of those things that you see at Boston at High and Fulton at Winslow and Medford at Albion and Maine at Albion and Columbus School, those are cost-effective traffic calming measures using paint.

472
00:36:53,469 --> 00:36:54,430
[SPEAKER_04]: And right now,

473
00:36:55,029 --> 00:37:10,312
[SPEAKER_04]: They're movable tall cones, but the idea is flex posts that would be stuck to the ground, which is right now the most local example for folks is Medford Square on the double yellow line in the area of Carrolls and Clippership Drive.

474
00:37:11,152 --> 00:37:13,153
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's what would be there.

475
00:37:13,173 --> 00:37:13,913
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good.

476
00:37:14,073 --> 00:37:21,815
[SPEAKER_04]: Or permanently, just that we're so close to winter that it didn't make sense to stick a lot of those down and then take them up for the winter snow.

477
00:37:21,935 --> 00:37:23,835
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is all temporary.

478
00:37:24,758 --> 00:37:34,323
[SPEAKER_04]: The idea is the tall cones are temporary until we establish where we're going to place the cones that would be up for nine months to the year.

479
00:37:34,383 --> 00:37:41,426
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we go that route, and these are, I realized these are all kind of new things for the city of Medford to experiment with.

480
00:37:41,526 --> 00:37:52,732
[SPEAKER_04]: And I appreciate the openness and allowing us to experiment with these things to try to improve safety by slowing speeds down, making crossing shorter, making drivers more aware of pedestrians.

481
00:37:54,249 --> 00:37:57,050
[SPEAKER_04]: And with all these things, there's some preferences.

482
00:37:57,090 --> 00:37:59,131
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people like certain things, some people don't.

483
00:37:59,231 --> 00:38:01,132
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's costs involved as well.

484
00:38:01,572 --> 00:38:06,875
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're trying our best to address concerns that are raised to us in a cost-efficient manner.

485
00:38:07,055 --> 00:38:14,058
[SPEAKER_04]: So we realize that sometimes everyone wants the raised crosswalk everywhere.

486
00:38:14,419 --> 00:38:16,159
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not opposed to those myself.

487
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:20,361
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just there's a lot of requests, as you know.

488
00:38:20,521 --> 00:38:23,683
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're trying our best, and we're definitely

489
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:25,158
[SPEAKER_04]: open to trying new things.

490
00:38:25,498 --> 00:38:32,620
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why the Grove Street speed table was an example of a more cost efficient speed hump than a raised crosswalk like Winthrop Street.

491
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:42,082
[SPEAKER_04]: So just for order of magnitude, the Grove Street speed table is about one-fifth the cost of the Winthrop Street raised crosswalk.

492
00:38:43,043 --> 00:38:44,843
[SPEAKER_04]: So those are things that I've told that

493
00:38:45,356 --> 00:38:47,557
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been told that that's been pretty well received.

494
00:38:47,617 --> 00:38:48,798
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a more gradual bump.

495
00:38:49,198 --> 00:38:51,659
[SPEAKER_04]: The idea is to get people to go 25, not 40.

496
00:38:51,879 --> 00:38:53,360
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't get people to go 10 or 5.

497
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:54,641
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not the idea.

498
00:38:55,121 --> 00:38:57,702
[SPEAKER_04]: So those are available in our toolbox as well.

499
00:38:59,563 --> 00:39:00,864
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that, I appreciate that.

500
00:39:00,884 --> 00:39:08,308
[SPEAKER_02]: So I really think something like that, where that's more cost efficient, but more importantly,

501
00:39:09,395 --> 00:39:11,179
[SPEAKER_02]: It's long lasting.

502
00:39:12,781 --> 00:39:19,093
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're looking at something that's $10,000, putting in that what they've done on Grove Street and add that to what you can do at.

503
00:39:22,057 --> 00:39:36,607
[SPEAKER_02]: at Central Ave, using that example, that would drastically slow down that dangerous roadway by putting those cheaper, more efficient hurdles to slow that traffic down.

504
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:43,773
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, not looking at, because I'll tell you the truth, Todd, I appreciate everything you guys are doing, and I appreciate trying these.

505
00:39:43,853 --> 00:39:48,576
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you're looking at putting in ten different areas with this temporary

506
00:39:51,357 --> 00:40:10,281
[SPEAKER_02]: $4,000 hits here and there, to me, I just think that it's not worth doing it right now until we're doing the full-time piece and using that money to something like the raised roadway in Central and other locations.

507
00:40:10,301 --> 00:40:14,041
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's my preference, but that's my concern.

508
00:40:14,061 --> 00:40:15,561
[SPEAKER_02]: And I look at equity.

509
00:40:20,444 --> 00:40:23,006
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been talking about Riverside Ave, Todd, for a while.

510
00:40:23,486 --> 00:40:25,468
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't see anything here with Riverside Ave.

511
00:40:26,329 --> 00:40:31,513
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a major complex with two of the biggest schools in our community.

512
00:40:32,153 --> 00:40:34,495
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's been some issues.

513
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:40,880
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had some issues there with both lack of cross lights, with traffic calming measures.

514
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,062
[SPEAKER_02]: And did we entertain anything on Riverside Ave?

515
00:40:46,024 --> 00:40:48,546
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, if either the president

516
00:40:49,248 --> 00:40:51,630
[SPEAKER_04]: or Adam could allow me to share my screen.

517
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:56,894
[SPEAKER_04]: I could show you a map of the last two years ride share.

518
00:40:58,255 --> 00:41:00,277
[SPEAKER_08]: Adam, can you please help him out with that?

519
00:41:01,478 --> 00:41:03,019
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm on it.

520
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:07,603
[SPEAKER_04]: While I'm waiting on that, yeah, Council, these are all great points.

521
00:41:07,683 --> 00:41:11,366
[SPEAKER_04]: And as I said, we're trying our best to spread the wealth around the city.

522
00:41:11,746 --> 00:41:12,227
[SPEAKER_04]: And there are

523
00:41:13,206 --> 00:41:24,213
[SPEAKER_04]: So some things about raised crosswalks and speed tables and raised intersections, besides the cost, there are certain strategic locations that I would recommend for some versus others.

524
00:41:24,253 --> 00:41:29,557
[SPEAKER_04]: So like some of them are more suited for mid blocks, some of them are more suited for intersections and things like that.

525
00:41:30,077 --> 00:41:34,360
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm familiar with the powerhouse at Curtis, one that you spoke of in that area.

526
00:41:36,281 --> 00:41:40,324
[SPEAKER_04]: And some of these painted bump outs with

527
00:41:43,171 --> 00:41:54,816
[SPEAKER_04]: With cones, I mean, those are in lieu of, in some cases, the larger intersections, you get some improvements for thousands versus hundreds of thousands.

528
00:41:55,537 --> 00:42:02,039
[SPEAKER_04]: So like, for instance, Tufts Square, that costs a half million dollars to build that large bump out.

529
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:08,542
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's effective for main street traffic, but we don't, I don't believe we have a half million dollars to put everywhere.

530
00:42:08,582 --> 00:42:09,923
[SPEAKER_04]: So what we're trying to do is,

531
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:15,793
[SPEAKER_04]: get some of the improvements with these other treatments, if that makes sense.

532
00:42:16,133 --> 00:42:23,958
[SPEAKER_02]: So this- And I just want you to know, Todd, you came into a very difficult position.

533
00:42:24,038 --> 00:42:30,402
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and I'm not, this is just conversation that I've talked to constituents about, and just to share comments.

534
00:42:30,442 --> 00:42:34,524
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that you're doing a great job, and we are seeing a drastic difference.

535
00:42:34,604 --> 00:42:36,926
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think people in our community see that.

536
00:42:37,426 --> 00:42:41,049
[SPEAKER_02]: We've committed to traffic calming measures.

537
00:42:41,689 --> 00:42:53,658
[SPEAKER_02]: And other than South and Main, I'm going to be honest with you, throughout the rest of the city, I think we've seen a huge support by your office in this community to say, let's try to find ways to make it happen.

538
00:42:53,698 --> 00:42:55,299
[SPEAKER_02]: So I really appreciate that.

539
00:42:55,339 --> 00:42:59,902
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't want to, I'm not, if it sounds negative, I don't, I'm just looking at other avenues.

540
00:43:00,643 --> 00:43:01,604
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you.

541
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:02,184
[SPEAKER_04]: Not at all.

542
00:43:02,204 --> 00:43:05,927
[SPEAKER_04]: So on the screen is a map of the last two years improvements.

543
00:43:06,334 --> 00:43:10,617
[SPEAKER_04]: So it kind of gives you a great visual to show how spread out throughout the city it is.

544
00:43:11,378 --> 00:43:17,503
[SPEAKER_04]: The red ones are from the first year, the blue ones are the next year, and the fiscal year 21 are not on this map.

545
00:43:17,863 --> 00:43:23,548
[SPEAKER_04]: But I just wanted to point out that the Riverside comment, there was one from fiscal year 19, a flashing sign.

546
00:43:23,608 --> 00:43:25,489
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it was just a flashing sign, but it was something.

547
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:34,857
[SPEAKER_04]: In Riverside, there'll be another opportunity coming up soon where there's several utility companies that want to get into Riverside Ave, and usually after,

548
00:43:35,497 --> 00:43:37,390
[SPEAKER_04]: Utility companies in or after

549
00:43:38,097 --> 00:43:40,619
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the city itself is in for repaving and whatnot.

550
00:43:40,879 --> 00:43:42,400
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are opportunities to do things.

551
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:46,962
[SPEAKER_04]: That's when the Grove Street speed table came about, because it was already being repaved.

552
00:43:48,323 --> 00:43:52,886
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully you guys noticed, everyone noticed in the city, all the improvements on Locust Street.

553
00:43:53,206 --> 00:43:58,669
[SPEAKER_04]: It took two and a half years to get built, but those were part of mitigation commitments from that development.

554
00:43:58,950 --> 00:44:03,152
[SPEAKER_04]: So Locust Street is almost completely redesigned with a lot of good stuff on there.

555
00:44:03,712 --> 00:44:05,353
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's off of Riverside Ave.

556
00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:12,994
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so hopefully each neighbor understands that we're concerned and we're getting to them eventually.

557
00:44:14,175 --> 00:44:17,857
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, we'd like to hear from people what they like and what they want too, so.

558
00:44:18,398 --> 00:44:18,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

559
00:44:19,358 --> 00:44:19,859
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Todd.

560
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:22,961
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

561
00:44:23,961 --> 00:44:24,562
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Bears.

562
00:44:24,782 --> 00:44:25,703
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. President.

563
00:44:25,723 --> 00:44:26,283
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you, Todd.

564
00:44:26,303 --> 00:44:27,944
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a couple of questions for you through the chair.

565
00:44:28,345 --> 00:44:34,349
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of goes off what Councilor Scarpelli just said, these bollards and sticks and posts.

566
00:44:35,762 --> 00:44:43,444
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there any plans in some of these locations, at least thoughts about designs for a more permanent narrowing?

567
00:44:43,624 --> 00:44:49,026
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is the idea just to kind of have these cones and then go to flex posts as a next step?

568
00:44:50,846 --> 00:44:52,487
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a great question.

569
00:44:53,307 --> 00:45:05,170
[SPEAKER_04]: So with the paint, sometimes you get some of the benefits without all the costs and headaches of the full design, meaning construction, cement, curb, drainage, all that stuff.

570
00:45:05,856 --> 00:45:14,522
[SPEAKER_04]: So sometimes the paint gives an appearance enough by itself without cones, then the cones add a vertical element to get really the driver's attention.

571
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:22,987
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's a brand new thing that we have out on the street at Medford at Albion, where it's a tan colored paint that's meant to look like a sidewalk bump out, but it's not a bump out.

572
00:45:23,508 --> 00:45:26,390
[SPEAKER_04]: And the other thing with the paint is you can get more aggressive with it.

573
00:45:26,770 --> 00:45:34,615
[SPEAKER_04]: With curb, you can't go out as far with it because you truly have to accommodate trucks and buses and emergency vehicles, whereas paint,

574
00:45:35,302 --> 00:45:40,905
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you're trying to get most of the motorists to follow that, but it still allows for it to be driven over.

575
00:45:41,466 --> 00:45:51,992
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, we'd love to do all of it with full design, but there are 730 plus streets and 1600 plus intersections.

576
00:45:52,152 --> 00:46:00,917
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, we're constantly trying to find different sources of, you know, funds for all these things that we want to do for the community.

577
00:46:01,357 --> 00:46:04,439
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, we've been pretty successful lately with a lot of

578
00:46:04,827 --> 00:46:06,127
[SPEAKER_04]: grants that we've received.

579
00:46:06,948 --> 00:46:08,648
[SPEAKER_04]: And we hope to do that in the future.

580
00:46:08,708 --> 00:46:18,591
[SPEAKER_04]: But I guess the answer is, we'd like to do permanent improvements everywhere if and when possible.

581
00:46:19,051 --> 00:46:22,533
[SPEAKER_04]: But these are strategies used in other communities as well.

582
00:46:22,873 --> 00:46:26,374
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, some people, there's different preferences.

583
00:46:26,414 --> 00:46:30,895
[SPEAKER_04]: But they are used in Boston, Cambridge, Somerville, Seattle, all over the US.

584
00:46:34,195 --> 00:46:37,016
[SPEAKER_04]: Let us know which ones you like and where you want them, and we'll try to do it.

585
00:46:38,456 --> 00:46:38,936
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Todd.

586
00:46:38,996 --> 00:46:40,077
[SPEAKER_01]: And just another question.

587
00:46:40,337 --> 00:46:49,719
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not actually directly on this TNC appropriation, but I've gotten calls from a couple of residents concerned about access to their driveways.

588
00:46:49,759 --> 00:46:55,901
[SPEAKER_01]: They kind of live near some of these new cone projects, and they're having a difficult time getting in and out of their driveways.

589
00:46:56,261 --> 00:47:01,302
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you talk to abutters who might be disrupted by the new cones that have been put up about that?

590
00:47:02,722 --> 00:47:09,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I've had conversations with internal staff and abutters and everything to work through these things, because they're new to Medford.

591
00:47:11,126 --> 00:47:18,070
[SPEAKER_04]: So one at Boston and High contacted me and said, hey, I'm having difficulty going in on my driveway.

592
00:47:18,090 --> 00:47:18,850
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a cone there.

593
00:47:19,431 --> 00:47:20,791
[SPEAKER_04]: And they were wondering.

594
00:47:20,811 --> 00:47:24,173
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't want to just move it on their own without permission.

595
00:47:24,233 --> 00:47:25,594
[SPEAKER_04]: And I said, no, that's fine.

596
00:47:25,634 --> 00:47:26,714
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll move it.

597
00:47:26,755 --> 00:47:29,496
[SPEAKER_04]: We're here to help any unintentional

598
00:47:30,066 --> 00:47:32,547
[SPEAKER_04]: negative consequences is truly unintentional.

599
00:47:33,048 --> 00:47:34,848
[SPEAKER_04]: So we can move it.

600
00:47:34,908 --> 00:47:35,529
[SPEAKER_04]: We can move it.

601
00:47:35,549 --> 00:47:36,229
[SPEAKER_04]: They can move it.

602
00:47:36,469 --> 00:47:48,355
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, as long as it's not in the travel lane, it's just meant to add a vertical element to get people to comply with the white lines, because if the vertical element's not there, they just drive right over it as they've always done.

603
00:47:48,455 --> 00:47:56,039
[SPEAKER_04]: So we heard, you know, Boston at High, that was the one I was speaking of last year on social media, it blew up that it was a big safety issue.

604
00:47:56,059 --> 00:47:59,641
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're trying to slow people down, make them take tighter turns.

605
00:48:01,389 --> 00:48:15,616
[SPEAKER_04]: Another one was at main at Albion really opposite Hicks and a resident owner there, I spoke to, and, you know, I asked her if the cones are new, she said, no, she thinks it's great.

606
00:48:15,676 --> 00:48:21,499
[SPEAKER_04]: And she mentioned about the street sweepers that she goes above and beyond and moves it and moves it back.

607
00:48:21,579 --> 00:48:22,539
[SPEAKER_04]: And I said, that's great.

608
00:48:22,579 --> 00:48:23,400
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for doing that.

609
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:27,542
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's, it takes, as people said in the committee meeting,

610
00:48:28,075 --> 00:48:29,756
[SPEAKER_04]: it takes all of us to work together.

611
00:48:29,816 --> 00:48:38,441
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, that's one thing I do want to say about all this stuff, anything you see on the street, it's truly with the intent to help improve.

612
00:48:39,221 --> 00:48:44,244
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not meant to be, you know, negatively impact anyone's lives in any way.

613
00:48:45,285 --> 00:48:57,352
[SPEAKER_04]: Although with that being said, sometimes there are known trade-offs, not for that particular project, but you know, in other cases, when you do, you know, there's certain things in the right away that have to be

614
00:48:57,699 --> 00:49:02,405
[SPEAKER_04]: trade it, like parking versus bump up versus bike lane versus, you know.

615
00:49:02,425 --> 00:49:07,952
[SPEAKER_04]: So sometimes there are known impacts like that, but that's not the intent.

616
00:49:09,735 --> 00:49:14,080
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's the exact tone to approach this with, Todd.

617
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:14,581
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.

618
00:49:17,179 --> 00:49:19,962
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Bears, Vice President Caraviello.

619
00:49:20,282 --> 00:49:20,923
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

620
00:49:21,003 --> 00:49:22,364
[SPEAKER_03]: Todd, just a quick thing.

621
00:49:22,985 --> 00:49:30,572
[SPEAKER_03]: You painted some bump outs on Golden Avenue at the beginning.

622
00:49:32,094 --> 00:49:36,658
[SPEAKER_03]: And those cones are just crushed that you put up there.

623
00:49:39,184 --> 00:49:51,967
[SPEAKER_03]: have those replaced, I mean, I think there was like four or five, I think like six of them, and I think there's only one left standing, they're all kind of just bent over on the ground, so if you could at least replace those?

624
00:49:52,727 --> 00:49:56,048
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that one, there were four, they will definitely look into that.

625
00:49:56,168 --> 00:49:57,688
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they're just crushed.

626
00:49:57,708 --> 00:50:06,971
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a case where there are signs saying no trucks, but compliance-wise, I guess, you know, people weren't necessarily satisfied with the compliance, so.

627
00:50:07,351 --> 00:50:08,411
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the trucks just ran them over.

628
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:18,262
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was another attempt to paint bump outs to give the visual impression of a more narrow side street and also the vertical cones.

629
00:50:19,802 --> 00:50:20,602
[SPEAKER_04]: And that will happen.

630
00:50:20,642 --> 00:50:27,864
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why we went with the movable ones at first so that we could play around the position of them.

631
00:50:28,044 --> 00:50:32,725
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe if we choose ones that stick, we'll position a little further back.

632
00:50:33,837 --> 00:50:35,579
[SPEAKER_04]: These are the things that we're trying to do to help folks.

633
00:50:35,619 --> 00:50:40,744
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I say, if you could replace them, it would be, the residents over there would appreciate that.

634
00:50:41,505 --> 00:50:41,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

635
00:50:42,146 --> 00:50:42,486
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

636
00:50:42,686 --> 00:50:43,908
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Vice President Caraviello.

637
00:50:46,791 --> 00:50:55,560
[SPEAKER_08]: Todd, if I may ask really quick, and I may, maybe I missed this, but you had, when Councilor Scarpelli was asking about the, the various,

638
00:50:56,906 --> 00:51:00,107
[SPEAKER_08]: we'll call them cones or the sticks that we'll put up.

639
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:06,389
[SPEAKER_08]: And you made it sound like, I think you said if we head in that direction, making it sound like those will be permanent.

640
00:51:06,509 --> 00:51:07,049
[SPEAKER_08]: Am I correct?

641
00:51:09,029 --> 00:51:20,532
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, these are options available to the city again, cheaper than curbing because curbing a curbs bump out at one corner of an intersection might run you 10 to $20,000.

642
00:51:20,893 --> 00:51:25,374
[SPEAKER_04]: And these are, you know, hundreds or, or, you know, a thousand dollars.

643
00:51:25,394 --> 00:51:25,774
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like,

644
00:51:26,786 --> 00:51:31,757
[SPEAKER_04]: cost effective measures to try to get the same impact without impacting drainage and things like that.

645
00:51:32,318 --> 00:51:36,447
[SPEAKER_04]: So the cones, you could either just paint the bump outs.

646
00:51:37,318 --> 00:51:44,480
[SPEAKER_04]: White, you could paint them with tan color as we just did in Medford at Albion on one corner just to show an example.

647
00:51:45,621 --> 00:51:48,762
[SPEAKER_04]: You could do that with or without cones or flex posts.

648
00:51:49,302 --> 00:51:53,063
[SPEAKER_04]: The flex posts and the cones, what they do is they add a vertical element.

649
00:51:53,643 --> 00:51:58,705
[SPEAKER_04]: So originally when we painted the heights in Boston at high with just paint,

650
00:51:59,537 --> 00:52:02,519
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't really hear about it because people could just still drive over it.

651
00:52:02,539 --> 00:52:07,602
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, with the vertical element, it adds that other flavor and they kind of have to comply.

652
00:52:07,662 --> 00:52:13,045
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they could still, it's plastic, so they can still run over it, but at the risk of their vehicle.

653
00:52:13,085 --> 00:52:17,628
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's, you know, these are things that are meant to help with compliance.

654
00:52:18,847 --> 00:52:33,094
[SPEAKER_08]: So if I may, I completely understand the vertical element, but will the temporary vertical elements, which are the cones now be replaced by the more permanent vertical elements, which are drilled into the ground?

655
00:52:34,534 --> 00:52:36,095
[SPEAKER_04]: The intent is to do that.

656
00:52:36,515 --> 00:52:45,039
[SPEAKER_04]: And then because we're so close to the winter right now, so instead of two months and then they have to be removed, the intent is in the spring would go back and put in

657
00:52:45,689 --> 00:52:49,630
[SPEAKER_04]: either screwed in or stuck to the ground with adhesive versions.

658
00:52:49,710 --> 00:52:54,851
[SPEAKER_04]: And those versions are more narrow and a little smaller, but the same color and the same idea.

659
00:52:55,111 --> 00:52:56,532
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so I understand that.

660
00:52:56,592 --> 00:53:05,854
[SPEAKER_08]: So is the cost for those that are more permanent in nature, are those part of this here, or will there be funding that you'll be looking for in the spring for that?

661
00:53:07,755 --> 00:53:10,035
[SPEAKER_04]: No, those were inclusive of the previous year.

662
00:53:10,075 --> 00:53:13,276
[SPEAKER_04]: So Boston High was in one of the last year's list in Fulton.

663
00:53:14,336 --> 00:53:25,725
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll say they're permanent in the sense that they last about nine months and they'll have to be redone every year and last about nine months each year because it's ongoing.

664
00:53:26,065 --> 00:53:26,325
[SPEAKER_04]: So.

665
00:53:28,988 --> 00:53:29,288
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

666
00:53:30,048 --> 00:53:32,891
[SPEAKER_08]: So I thank you so much for all your hard work.

667
00:53:32,991 --> 00:53:34,852
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe Aleesha wants to speak.

668
00:53:34,973 --> 00:53:37,074
[SPEAKER_08]: Aleesha, I'm trying to unmute you.

669
00:53:41,078 --> 00:53:41,458
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

670
00:53:41,937 --> 00:53:43,097
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Council President.

671
00:53:43,157 --> 00:53:47,379
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I just wanted to follow up on Councilor Scarpelli's request for funding.

672
00:53:47,439 --> 00:53:49,019
[SPEAKER_06]: Last year, it was 122, 122.90.

673
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:52,480
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's actually increased by 14,000.

674
00:53:53,081 --> 00:53:53,401
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

675
00:53:58,882 --> 00:54:01,263
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the, am I still on?

676
00:54:02,023 --> 00:54:03,184
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, you're still on, Todd.

677
00:54:03,864 --> 00:54:09,526
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the explanation for that with the pandemic is that the fee went up, but the rides probably went down to a balance of,

678
00:54:11,924 --> 00:54:12,884
[SPEAKER_04]: What did the fee go up to?

679
00:54:12,904 --> 00:54:14,765
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought it was $0.10.

680
00:54:15,065 --> 00:54:16,226
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we know what the fee went up to?

681
00:54:20,827 --> 00:54:22,888
[SPEAKER_08]: Todd, will you know the answer to that?

682
00:54:23,748 --> 00:54:27,029
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd confirm with Aleesha, but I believe it went up to $0.20.

683
00:54:27,609 --> 00:54:28,850
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's $0.20.

684
00:54:28,970 --> 00:54:31,031
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wow, that's a big drop from last year then.

685
00:54:31,091 --> 00:54:32,471
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd confirm with Aleesha.

686
00:54:32,531 --> 00:54:35,832
[SPEAKER_03]: I think last year we got like $190,000 the year before, if I'm not mistaken, $192,000.

687
00:54:41,667 --> 00:54:42,767
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, that was a big drop.

688
00:54:43,448 --> 00:54:48,449
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, and it was all relative to, you know, the COVID thing.

689
00:54:48,629 --> 00:54:53,951
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, people just stopped, you know, started saying, you know, we're using, so we should be happy that we even got that much money.

690
00:54:54,311 --> 00:54:55,812
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank God that they doubled the rate.

691
00:54:58,153 --> 00:54:58,573
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

785
00:58:49,209 --> 00:58:49,671
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President?

786
00:58:50,695 --> 00:58:52,945
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have any other papers in suspension there?

787
00:58:59,767 --> 00:59:00,968
[SPEAKER_08]: I do not, but I have my message.

788
00:59:01,008 --> 00:59:05,693
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, I'd like to give a little shout out to one of our Methodist residents, if I could.

789
00:59:06,053 --> 00:59:06,974
[SPEAKER_03]: Please, do so.

790
00:59:07,074 --> 00:59:17,964
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, being the veteran's subcommittee chairman, it was brought to my attention an event that happened last week, actually this week.

791
00:59:18,064 --> 00:59:20,246
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to give a little shout out to Noah Kreatz.

792
00:59:21,387 --> 00:59:23,169
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know if anybody saw what Noah did.

793
00:59:25,233 --> 00:59:31,561
[SPEAKER_03]: provided a uniform for a Navy homeless veteran that doesn't even live in Medford.

794
00:59:32,122 --> 00:59:41,994
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, Noah started his project, his veterans preservation out of his house, and the young man has done a great job.

795
00:59:42,615 --> 00:59:44,357
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd just like to thank him for the work he's done.

796
00:59:44,717 --> 00:59:53,122
[SPEAKER_03]: He reached out to this guy in a housing unit, not even from Medford, got him a uniform.

797
00:59:53,742 --> 00:59:58,525
[SPEAKER_03]: And the gentleman's name was Harry Stevenson that allowed Harry to be buried with dignity.

798
00:59:59,366 --> 01:00:03,388
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, I just want to thank Noah and his group for the work they've done.

799
01:00:03,928 --> 01:00:07,710
[SPEAKER_03]: And he should be an inspiration to a lot of other young kids in this community.

800
01:00:07,730 --> 01:00:11,833
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, thank Noah and thank you to his family for raising such a good boy.

801
01:00:12,773 --> 01:00:16,037
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Vice President Caraviello, and thank you to Noah Kreatz.

802
01:00:16,097 --> 01:00:20,141
[SPEAKER_08]: Noah has been doing a fabulous job with this.

803
01:00:20,221 --> 01:00:31,153
[SPEAKER_08]: He's very involved with all kinds of veterans organizations, and I know he travels around trying to document stories of veterans from around the Commonwealth.

804
01:00:31,554 --> 01:00:34,137
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's really important that we preserve

805
01:00:35,438 --> 01:00:42,303
[SPEAKER_08]: because this history is slowly going away, and he has served a very important role in this community.

806
01:00:42,984 --> 01:00:48,989
[SPEAKER_08]: And he's very giving of his time, and we appreciate everything he does.

807
01:00:49,029 --> 01:00:52,091
[SPEAKER_08]: And thank you to Noah Kreatz and the entire Kreatz family, so thank you.

808
01:00:52,251 --> 01:00:52,952
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

809
01:00:53,052 --> 01:00:55,474
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Vice President Caballero, and thank you for bringing that forward.

810
01:00:56,912 --> 01:00:57,412
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knight.

811
01:00:58,012 --> 01:00:59,173
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Mr. President.

812
01:00:59,513 --> 01:01:02,994
[SPEAKER_05]: Noah started this, and you gotta keep in mind now, Noah's what, 20 years old?

813
01:01:03,935 --> 01:01:05,215
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, 20 years old.

814
01:01:05,375 --> 01:01:14,799
[SPEAKER_05]: Three, four years ago, he started this mission where he began collecting World War II artifacts, World War II uniforms and the like.

815
01:01:15,859 --> 01:01:20,501
[SPEAKER_05]: And that morphed into this veteran's preservation project where Noah goes,

816
01:01:21,241 --> 01:01:28,648
[SPEAKER_05]: all across Massachusetts, all across New England, showing off his wares at various town hall meetings, veterans meetings.

817
01:01:29,529 --> 01:01:35,154
[SPEAKER_05]: Along with the artifacts that he has, he also has many stories that go along with it.

818
01:01:35,634 --> 01:01:41,260
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just very impressive, Mr. President, that a kid at such a young age has shown such a commitment.

819
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:48,486
[SPEAKER_05]: to furthering the memory of veterans here in Massachusetts, in Medford, and beyond.

820
01:01:48,866 --> 01:01:59,655
[SPEAKER_05]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I do think it might make sense for us to invite Noah down and honor him with a citation based upon the success of the Veterans Preservation Project.

821
01:02:00,155 --> 01:02:01,336
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'd offer that in full of a motion.

822
01:02:01,997 --> 01:02:08,122
[SPEAKER_08]: On that motion offered by Councilor Knight, seconded by Vice President Caraviello, Clerk Urnaby, please call the roll.

823
01:02:12,307 --> 01:02:13,568
[SPEAKER_10]: And just a second, I'm still writing it down.

824
01:02:15,749 --> 01:02:16,050
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

825

[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

838
01:02:33,941 --> 01:02:36,102

01:02:36,122 --> 01:02:36,962
[SPEAKER_08]: The motion passes.

840
01:02:37,583 --> 01:02:39,124
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Bears, my apologies.

841
01:02:39,184 --> 01:02:39,524
[SPEAKER_08]: I missed you.

842
01:02:39,544 --> 01:02:40,204
[SPEAKER_08]: You had your hand up.

843
01:02:40,444 --> 01:02:41,065

[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to thank Noah as well.

01:02:44,226 --> 01:02:57,334
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think Noah's work on this, and I know also has worked with many other young Medford residents on this as well, really speaks to how involved so many young people are in our community and all the different facets of

847
01:02:58,651 --> 01:03:03,112

848
01:03:03,172 --> 01:03:12,694
[SPEAKER_01]: I just think we should be recognizing that and recognizing the great work of our public school system and our general community and raising a great crop of young people.
