    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1005.448s">Councilor</a>  Knight, did you have a question?</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1007.529s">I</a>  did, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1009.781s">I</a>  do believe that this council during budget time requested that we'd have a quarterly meeting relative to where we were with forecasts and receipts. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1018.523s">And</a>  then the council did vote on a resolution asking that this meeting take place relative to the state of the city's finances for the second Tuesday in October. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1029.385s">That</a>  never happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1031.465s">And</a>  here we are this evening with a request for appropriation before us, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1035.727s">So,</a>  you know, I know that these funds are through the surcharges around those Uber and Lyft rides that originate in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1042.377s">And</a>  looking at the appendix that's attached, I certainly see no issue with the appropriations. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1048.605s">I'd</a>  like to see them maybe <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1050.256s">distributed</a>  a little bit more equitably across the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1054.379s">However,</a>  I feel as though it's important, Mr. President, that we sit down and schedule a time for us to talk about the state of our finances here in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1063.145s">During</a>  the budget, we were talking about a fiscal crisis. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1067.188s">We</a>  took $5.5 million from our reserves and we appropriated that much money from our reserves to balance the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1073.673s">The</a>  question is, are we doing better now? <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1076.698s">Do</a>  we have the ability to restore some of those funds back to our reserves if our forecasts are showing that our receipts are up well above anticipated returns? <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1085.635s">So</a>  Mr. President, it was very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1088.191s">discussion</a>  that took place during the budget, and this was one of the items that came out of that, was that we'd meet quarterly to determine what the current and ongoing state of fiscal affairs is in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1098.358s">And</a>  that needs to happen, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1100.44s">And</a>  we have a paper before us asking us to appropriate $136,000, but we still haven't had that meeting to recap the last quarter. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1108.425s">So</a>  that's concerning to me, Mr. President, and I'm hoping that the finance director would be able to coordinate with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1115.87s">to</a>  determine a time where we'll be able to do that before the next quarter is over. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1119.994s">So</a>  with that being said, here we are almost one month into the next quarter, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1125.098s">So</a>  we're going to get a skewed perspective of what's going on if we don't meet as close to the close of the quarter as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1133.444s">So</a>  I'd ask that that meeting be scheduled.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1135.746s">If</a>  I'm correct, you wanted that during the regular session, right?</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1141.951s">I</a>  did want it during the regular session, yes, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1146.636s">If</a>  this was a free cash appropriation, I'd be much more concerned about taking a vote this evening on it, but where it's coming from a dedicated accountant that has a dedicated purpose, that's another thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1158.383s">So</a>  that being said, Mr. President, this will be the last money paper I vote on until we have that quarterly meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1165.688s">So</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, I rest my case.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1167.889s">Thank</a>  you, Constant. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1168.71s">We'll</a>  get that scheduled. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1170.05s">I'll</a>  reach out to Aleesha tomorrow, and we'll get that scheduled. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1173.166s">Mr.</a>  President, do we have?</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1176.887s">Do</a>  we have the city engineer on?</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1183.949s">I</a>  do not see, you want the traffic engineer, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1186.95s">Traffic</a>  engineer, city engineer, anyone at all.</p>

    <p>[Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1189.611s">Todd</a>  Blake is on. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1192.452s">Is</a>  he here? <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1192.852s">Okay,</a>  let me see.</p>

    <p>[Blake]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1227.844s">We're</a>  proposing a radar feedback sign in North Medford on Fells Ave as the steep part going downhill. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1239.333s">We're</a>  proposing a pedestrian warning flashing sign on Fulton Street near Watson Street in the Heights. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1249.601s">We're</a>  proposing in the Wellington area on Bradbury Ave at 2nd Street, flashing stop sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1255.905s">in</a>  the hillside area in the north at Capon, a flashing stop sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1261.386s">Then</a>  I'll jump to the bottom of the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1264.347s">In</a>  East Metro Glenwood area, we're proposing a Salem at Hadley to be a flex post design, painted bump outs to try to address some safety concerns there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1277.791s">And</a>  then there, <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1280.248s">Five</a>  others that are taken from the 2016 Complete Streets Top 20 Prioritized List that are still not complete. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1290.671s">So</a>  we're trying to address some of those to get them off that list. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1295.613s">One</a>  is in South Medford at Main Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1298.713s">On</a>  Main Street at Frederick Ave, most of it includes new wheelchair ramps. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1304.235s">West</a>  Medford Place that road at Irving Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1307.876s">Same</a>  thing, new wheelchair ramps, South Medford, Main Street at Stearns Ave, crossing Main, wheelchair ramps. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1316.841s">West</a>  Medford, Sharon Street at Fairfield Street, same thing, wheelchair ramps. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1322.603s">And</a>  then also in the Lawrence Estates, North slash Central Medford on Ford Street at Webster and Cedar. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1333.329s">There</a>  has been some work done there in the past related to a paving job, <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1338.585s">complete</a>  the rest of what's outlined in the 2016 top 20?</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1346.687s">So,</a>  Mr. President, if I could, just because this has been a longstanding issue with this council, it predates Todd. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1358.39s">But</a>  Todd, many years back, this council voted to implement a pilot program for raised crosswalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1366.585s">And</a>  at the time, three of them were recognized by the city under a previous administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1373.194s">One</a>  out of the three was initiated on Winthrop Street, Central Ave, and Harvard Street have yet to get their raised crosswalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1384.329s">Is</a>  that something that's being looked at or can we assume now that it's been several years that that is not being reviewed and no longer is part of the commitment that was made by a previous administration?</p>

    <p>[Blake]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1399.493s">As</a>  you said, that predates me, but I could say that obviously the Winter Street one is there and the two others, you know, they're on a long list of which includes this complete streets list. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1412.441s">And</a>  in the past we've selected from previous council papers, as well as safety concerns received by various city staff, various city departments. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1426.606s">So</a>  I couldn't say what the status is of those two that you're speaking of, but I will say in the two years past and this year as well, we're trying to, with this particular money, we're trying to spread it out as much as we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1442.618s">and</a>  get, you know, choose somewhat strategically in the sense of how much per, so we could get more locations. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1451.924s">Something</a>  like just an order of magnitude for a raised crosswalk in the similar fashion as Winthrop Street costs at that time about $50,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1465.256s">I'm</a>  told, I wasn't here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1467.078s">So</a>  something like that, you'd be able to get maybe two of those with this money. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1471.922s">So</a>  just to give you an idea, in years past, we've gotten about 25 locations. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1475.506s">Does</a>  that help? <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1478.489s">It</a>  doesn't necessarily address exactly what you're saying, but there are many lists that we try to go off of. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1485.776s">And</a>  there are some of these crosswalks coming as part of the Eversource MOU agreement.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1491.175s">Right,</a>  and I realize when city administrations change, there may be a different direction in communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1498.659s">However,</a>  when residents are promised certain items to happen, especially with traffic coming in their neighborhoods, they don't look at it and say, now we have a new mayor, there's a new direction, and we're not going to get the raised crosswalk we were promised under the last mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1513.946s">because</a>  now there's a different direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1516.167s">I</a>  don't think residents see it that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1518.088s">They</a>  would hope that commitments are kept from administration to administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1522.91s">And</a>  when you have a pilot program, at some point, a pilot program is supposed to have an end date. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1529.733s">So</a>  you're supposed to review how successful the pilot was and either decide to move on with other race crosswalks or decide that they're not useful and don't provide the safety that we need in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1542.699s">But</a>  either way, at some point, I think we have to put this issue to rest. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1547.722s">And</a>  now you're the traffic engineer, and if indeed these other two areas, Central Ave, I get calls all the time about speeding cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1556.047s">I</a>  think all my colleagues can attest to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1558.788s">This</a>  was an ideal place for a raised crosswalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1562.53s">I</a>  can appreciate the expense. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1564.692s">I</a>  remember on Ring Road when they put that blinking crosswalk that looked like airplane traffic lights. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1573.057s">on</a>  ring road, that cost about $46,000 to put that on ring road. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1580.902s">And</a>  I would say within the first six months, it stopped working and it hasn't worked since. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1586.446s">So</a>  talk about putting good money after bad money into something that is no longer even in effect. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1592.81s">At</a>  least the winter street race crosswalk is still serving a purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1597.313s">I</a>  would respectfully ask as part of this paper, and I have no problem supporting this paper, <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1602.436s">that</a>  the city administration respond back, Mr. President, on where do we stand with the raised crosswalks on Central Ave and Harvard Street, the commitment that was made several years back. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1614.723s">And</a>  if it's no longer a commitment, I'm a big boy, just let me know. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1619.706s">And</a>  I'll fight for something else, or I'll fight to see if we can get those once again to become a commitment. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1624.929s">But</a>  just to leave them hanging, leave residents hanging that were promised. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1629.568s">These</a>  were promised, these were articles in the paper, discussion among the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1633.79s">These</a>  were things that were open and notorious, and then just to forget about them like nothing's going on, doesn't, in disservice to this community and the residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1644.356s">And</a>  that's what gives government a bad name, Mr. President, when things get forgotten about. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1649.88s">And</a>  I'm not going to forget about these, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1652.361s">So</a>  if it's no longer a commitment of this administration, just let us know. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1656.802s">So</a>  Todd, if you can take that back to the city administration, and if it's not a commitment, then just let us know. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1664.863s">But</a>  if it is a commitment, then these two are a priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1668.664s">Residents</a>  have been waiting four to five years on these, and we have to come out whether or not the pilot program is successful or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1675.666s">And</a>  my idea, <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1678.367s">This</a>  is not something novel. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1679.707s">This</a>  is being done in many other communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1682.449s">A</a>  raised crosswalk puts you at a higher height, at a level with oncoming traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1688.032s">They're</a>  very, <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1692.83s">From</a>  a distance you can see them, they're very visually pleasing from a distance. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1699.194s">And</a>  they do provide safety in areas that we know are highly traveled and high rates of speed on those streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1708.14s">And</a>  if it provides safety for the community, whether it's $5 or $50,000, we just talked about shoveling sidewalks and creating a new ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1717.626s">It's</a>  worth every penny, in my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1720.688s">I</a>  know we want to make it look like we're everywhere in the community and putting these blinking signs up, which I may add, Mr. President, go by any blinking light. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1731.244s">And</a>  let me tell you, half the side's not blinking. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1734.205s">Some</a>  of it's blinking. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1735.085s">Some</a>  of it's not. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1736.165s">But</a>  these are pretty new. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1737.666s">And</a>  I don't know if the city goes around. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1739.606s">A</a>  lot of them are malfunctioning. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1741.607s">Or</a>  they're not working. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1742.507s">Or</a>  they're cheaper ones. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1743.448s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1744.208s">But</a>  they're not working. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1745.808s">They're</a>  not serving their intended purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1748.089s">So</a>  I would ask that the <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1751.97s">And</a>  this is no reflection, again, on the city and traffic engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1755.371s">I</a>  think he's doing a tremendous job. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1757.232s">But</a>  there has to be more follow-up in this community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1760.993s">So</a>  I would ask, in the form of a motion, that we get an update on the two crosswalks, Central Ave and Harvard Street, whether there's still a commitment in the time frame, and that the other blinking lights that are throughout the community that were recently put in, that the city go around and audit them to see why a lot of them are malfunctioning.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1781.65s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1782.711s">Clerk</a>  Hurtubise, do you have the language to that motion that was offered by Councilor Marks?</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1789.934s">I</a>  have everything except the audit on the blinking lights. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1795.737s">Hang</a>  on just a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1796.897s">I'll</a>  read it back.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1801.219s">Councilor</a>  Marks, do you want to make that a beat paper? <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1804.861s">We'll</a>  make that a beat paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1806.622s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1808.141s">What</a>  I have is a request that the administration respond back on where we stand on raised crosswalks on Central Avenue and Harvard Street, and a request that the city audit the blinking lights that were recently installed.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1822.611s">If</a>  we could just add language on the commitment for raised crosswalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1827.315s">I</a>  know I said a lot of stuff, but that's important because that was a commitment made by a previous administration, and that should be honored.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1836.274s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1836.894s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1837.294s">I'm</a>  going to respond back on where we stand on the commitment for raised crosswalks on Central Avenue and Harvard Street, and that the city audit the blinking lights that were recently installed.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1847.178s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Clerk.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1849.298s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1850.259s">On</a>  that- That is a B paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1852.179s">That</a>  is a B paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1852.959s">On</a>  that B paper offered by Councilor Marks, seconded by Vice President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1856.541s">Vice</a>  President Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1857.981s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1858.942s">Again,</a>  I want to thank Councilor Marks for bringing those two crosswalks up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1862.924s">I</a>  mean, I was by that council that had been waiting for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1866.666s">And</a>  our current mayor was by the council who was very supportive of those. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1871.669s">So</a>  Councilor Marks is right. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1873.71s">I</a>  mean, where are we with those? <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1876.792s">You</a>  just can't forget about it, make a promise and forget about it, no matter who's in charge. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1880.314s">So</a>  I'd like to see those two. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1882.475s">comes</a>  to fruition there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1883.596s">They're</a>  both heavily traveled streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1885.656s">And</a>  again, he's right. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1886.417s">We're</a>  always getting calls. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1887.797s">I</a>  mean, getting emails from the Harvest Street people about the traffic going up and down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1895.801s">So</a>  I'd like to thank you for bringing that up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1900.823s">But</a>  I have a question for Aleesha and Benjamin.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1904.525s">Yes,</a>  Aleesha. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1905.925s">He's</a>  still there to the chair? <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1906.906s">She</a>  is here with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1907.846s">Vice</a>  President Caraviello, please continue.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1910.131s">Aleesha,</a>  the money that we're appropriating, is that money from the first payment of the TNC, or is that new money?</p>

    <p>[Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1918.654s">That's</a>  new money. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1919.474s">We</a>  get new money every June from the TNC that has to be programmed, and then I give a report.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1924.416s">Are</a>  we up or down from last year on that number?</p>

    <p>[Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1929.698s">I'd</a>  have to compare that to that.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1931.159s">I</a>  think it was a little higher last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1933.58s">It</a>  might have been a little higher. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1934.8s">Yeah,</a>  I think with the COVID, the ride shares might have suffered a little bit too. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1940.373s">Okay,</a>  I was just checking, I wasn't sure if we were still using last year's money. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1944.216s">Did</a>  we expend all the money from the last payment? <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1948.639s">Almost</a>  all of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1949.64s">Almost</a>  all of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1950.72s">All</a>  right, thank you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1952.342s">Thank</a>  you, Vice President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1954.163s">Councilman</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1956.445s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1957.205s">First,</a>  let me thank Councilman Knight for bringing up a very major point, a very important point. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1962.489s">I</a>  think that what we're hearing from the state and what's being talked about, <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1969.397s">the</a>  fiscal damage that we're going to see in a year is going to be pretty damaging. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1975.125s">So</a>  I think it's important that the request that he put forth a while ago that we do meet and really understand where we are, especially with the <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1986.26s">the</a>  free cash and where we stand with that, and where we stand with our taxes and our collections and stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1995.064s">So</a>  I think it's important that we have an idea of where we are as we move forward, because let's not make this a secret. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2002.327s">Things</a>  are going to get really, really, really tough soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2005.369s">And</a>  we're going to have to make some hard decisions if we're not going to get the support that we need, both in the state and the federal side. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2012.112s">So</a>  I think that's very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2015.493s">Second,</a>  I know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2020.339s">We're</a>  looking at the raised crosswalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2023.381s">That's</a>  a great question, and it's something that was a great solution for the Central Ave location with Morrison-Parkes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2033.107s">Because</a>  before that pilot program, it was just a speedway. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2038.811s">And</a>  then it made a huge difference, being on the school committee back then, that that was one of the huge concern with the kids in the neighborhood, and the bus stops, and so on. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2051.626s">That</a>  is a huge concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2054.929s">But</a>  you see in neighbor communities, I know Todd might be familiar with it, I know that on Powder House Boulevard, there was an awful accident and a pedestrian death there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2064.936s">And</a>  what they did there is they didn't put <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2067.618s">a</a>  raised sidewalk, but they put a raised roadway with arrows depicting the rise. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2074.365s">And</a>  it really slows that traffic down in front of that school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2078.289s">And</a>  I can't see that being a major cost where it's actually, it was put into place very, very quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2087.858s">There</a>  were no decorative blocks, but there is <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2091.494s">a</a>  clear rise that slows down that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2096.037s">I</a>  think that if we can look into that, Todd, I'd love to get an idea if we can even possibly do that in some of the locations, including South Street, Main Street, as we're waiting for <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2109.146s">get</a>  through and see what they can do, but I'm just afraid we're going to get to a situation where there's going to be a death in one of these areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2116.75s">And</a>  we're going to be telling each other, we told you so. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2121.733s">And</a>  I don't want that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2122.873s">So</a>  if there's a way that we can look into that and look at some of this money because <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2127.802s">I</a>  need some clarity on what we're seeing around the neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2131.504s">And</a>  I know it might be like the 3,000, the 4,000, 5,000 hits with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2137.869s">But</a>  if you do it 15 times in the community, it's $50,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2145.173s">And</a>  it's something that looks temporary all over the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2148.635s">We</a>  have light white paint around intersection streets with these white <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2159.5s">They're</a>  not cones, they're just sticks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2161.761s">And</a>  within the first week that I saw them, especially in South Medford, they were knocked over immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2168.505s">Can</a>  you explain, is that temporary? <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2170.146s">Is</a>  that, how are we going to deal with that when it comes to, the question I had with the raised sidewalk at South and Main during the winter was, well, with plowing, we can't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2179.751s">Well,</a>  with all these sticks all over the place, how are we going to manage that area in that situation?</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2187.366s">Todd,</a>  would you like to answer Councilor Scarpelli's question, please?</p>

    <p>[Blake]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2191.089s">It</a>  was a great point, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2194.072s">So</a>  the idea of a lot of those things that you see at Boston at High and Fulton at Winslow and Medford at Albion and Maine at Albion and Columbus School, those are cost-effective traffic calming measures using paint. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2213.469s">And</a>  right now, <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2215.029s">They're</a>  movable tall cones, but the idea is flex posts that would be stuck to the ground, which is right now the most local example for folks is Medford Square on the double yellow line in the area of Carrolls and Clippership Drive. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2231.152s">So</a>  that's what would be there.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2233.173s">That's</a>  good.</p>

    <p>[Blake]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2234.073s">Or</a>  permanently, just that we're so close to winter that it didn't make sense to stick a lot of those down and then take them up for the winter snow. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2241.935s">So</a>  this is all temporary. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2244.758s">The</a>  idea is the tall cones are temporary until we establish where we're going to place the cones that would be up for nine months to the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2254.383s">So</a>  if we go that route, and these are, I realized these are all kind of new things for the city of Medford to experiment with. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2261.526s">And</a>  I appreciate the openness and allowing us to experiment with these things to try to improve safety by slowing speeds down, making crossing shorter, making drivers more aware of pedestrians. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2274.249s">And</a>  with all these things, there's some preferences. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2277.09s">Some</a>  people like certain things, some people don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2279.231s">And</a>  there's costs involved as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2281.572s">And</a>  we're trying our best to address concerns that are raised to us in a cost-efficient manner. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2287.055s">So</a>  we realize that sometimes everyone wants the raised crosswalk everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2294.419s">And</a>  I'm not opposed to those myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2296.48s">It's</a>  just there's a lot of requests, as you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2300.521s">And</a>  we're trying our best, and we're definitely <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2304.218s">open</a>  to trying new things. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2305.498s">That's</a>  why the Grove Street speed table was an example of a more cost efficient speed hump than a raised crosswalk like Winthrop Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2312.96s">So</a>  just for order of magnitude, the Grove Street speed table is about one-fifth the cost of the Winthrop Street raised crosswalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2323.043s">So</a>  those are things that I've told that <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2325.356s">I've</a>  been told that that's been pretty well received. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2327.617s">It's</a>  a more gradual bump. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2329.198s">The</a>  idea is to get people to go 25, not 40. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2331.879s">It</a>  doesn't get people to go 10 or 5. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2333.7s">That's</a>  not the idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2335.121s">So</a>  those are available in our toolbox as well.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2339.563s">So</a>  with that, I appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2340.884s">So</a>  I really think something like that, where that's more cost efficient, but more importantly, <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2349.395s">It's</a>  long lasting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2352.781s">If</a>  you're looking at something that's $10,000, putting in that what they've done on Grove Street and add that to what you can do at. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2362.057s">at</a>  Central Ave, using that example, that would drastically slow down that dangerous roadway by putting those cheaper, more efficient hurdles to slow that traffic down. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2377.208s">But</a>  at the same time, not looking at, because I'll tell you the truth, Todd, I appreciate everything you guys are doing, and I appreciate trying these. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2383.853s">But</a>  when you're looking at putting in ten different areas with this temporary <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2391.357s">$4,000</a>  hits here and there, to me, I just think that it's not worth doing it right now until we're doing the full-time piece and using that money to something like the raised roadway in Central and other locations. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2410.301s">I</a>  know it's my preference, but that's my concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2414.061s">And</a>  I look at equity. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2420.444s">We've</a>  been talking about Riverside Ave, Todd, for a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2423.486s">And</a>  I don't see anything here with Riverside Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2426.329s">We</a>  have a major complex with two of the biggest schools in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2432.153s">And</a>  that's been some issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2434.515s">We've</a>  had some issues there with both lack of cross lights, with traffic calming measures. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2441.28s">And</a>  did we entertain anything on Riverside Ave?</p>

    <p>[Blake]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2446.024s">Yeah,</a>  if either the president <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2449.248s">or</a>  Adam could allow me to share my screen. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2451.69s">I</a>  could show you a map of the last two years ride share.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2458.255s">Adam,</a>  can you please help him out with that?</p>

    <p>[Blake]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2461.478s">I'm</a>  on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2463.88s">While</a>  I'm waiting on that, yeah, Council, these are all great points. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2467.683s">And</a>  as I said, we're trying our best to spread the wealth around the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2471.746s">And</a>  there are <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2473.206s">So</a>  some things about raised crosswalks and speed tables and raised intersections, besides the cost, there are certain strategic locations that I would recommend for some versus others. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2484.253s">So</a>  like some of them are more suited for mid blocks, some of them are more suited for intersections and things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2490.077s">I'm</a>  familiar with the powerhouse at Curtis, one that you spoke of in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2496.281s">And</a>  some of these painted bump outs with <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2503.171s">With</a>  cones, I mean, those are in lieu of, in some cases, the larger intersections, you get some improvements for thousands versus hundreds of thousands. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2515.537s">So</a>  like, for instance, Tufts Square, that costs a half million dollars to build that large bump out. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2522.5s">And</a>  it's effective for main street traffic, but we don't, I don't believe we have a half million dollars to put everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2528.582s">So</a>  what we're trying to do is, <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2530.63s">get</a>  some of the improvements with these other treatments, if that makes sense.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2536.133s">So</a>  this- And I just want you to know, Todd, you came into a very difficult position. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2544.038s">So,</a>  and I'm not, this is just conversation that I've talked to constituents about, and just to share comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2550.442s">I</a>  think that you're doing a great job, and we are seeing a drastic difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2554.604s">And</a>  I think people in our community see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2557.426s">We've</a>  committed to traffic calming measures. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2561.689s">And</a>  other than South and Main, I'm going to be honest with you, throughout the rest of the city, I think we've seen a huge support by your office in this community to say, let's try to find ways to make it happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2573.698s">So</a>  I really appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2575.339s">So</a>  I don't want to, I'm not, if it sounds negative, I don't, I'm just looking at other avenues.</p>

    <p>[Blake]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2580.643s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2581.704s">Not</a>  at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2582.204s">So</a>  on the screen is a map of the last two years improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2586.334s">So</a>  it kind of gives you a great visual to show how spread out throughout the city it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2591.378s">The</a>  red ones are from the first year, the blue ones are the next year, and the fiscal year 21 are not on this map. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2597.863s">But</a>  I just wanted to point out that the Riverside comment, there was one from fiscal year 19, a flashing sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2603.608s">I</a>  know it was just a flashing sign, but it was something. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2606.71s">In</a>  Riverside, there'll be another opportunity coming up soon where there's several utility companies that want to get into Riverside Ave, and usually after, <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2615.497s">Utility</a>  companies in or after <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2618.097s">You</a>  know, the city itself is in for repaving and whatnot. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2620.879s">Those</a>  are opportunities to do things. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2623.02s">That's</a>  when the Grove Street speed table came about, because it was already being repaved. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2628.323s">Hopefully</a>  you guys noticed, everyone noticed in the city, all the improvements on Locust Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2633.206s">It</a>  took two and a half years to get built, but those were part of mitigation commitments from that development. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2638.95s">So</a>  Locust Street is almost completely redesigned with a lot of good stuff on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2643.712s">And</a>  that's off of Riverside Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2647.23s">Yeah,</a>  so hopefully each neighbor understands that we're concerned and we're getting to them eventually. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2654.175s">And</a>  you know, we'd like to hear from people what they like and what they want too, so.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2658.398s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2659.358s">Thanks,</a>  Todd.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2661.66s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2663.961s">Councilor</a>  Bears.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2664.782s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2665.723s">And</a>  thank you, Todd. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2666.303s">I</a>  have a couple of questions for you through the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2668.345s">It</a>  kind of goes off what Councilor Scarpelli just said, these bollards and sticks and posts. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2675.762s">Are</a>  there any plans in some of these locations, at least thoughts about designs for a more permanent narrowing? <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2683.624s">Or</a>  is the idea just to kind of have these cones and then go to flex posts as a next step?</p>

    <p>[Blake]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2690.846s">So</a>  it's a great question. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2693.307s">So</a>  with the paint, sometimes you get some of the benefits without all the costs and headaches of the full design, meaning construction, cement, curb, drainage, all that stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2705.856s">So</a>  sometimes the paint gives an appearance enough by itself without cones, then the cones add a vertical element to get really the driver's attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2714.962s">And</a>  then there's a brand new thing that we have out on the street at Medford at Albion, where it's a tan colored paint that's meant to look like a sidewalk bump out, but it's not a bump out. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2723.508s">And</a>  the other thing with the paint is you can get more aggressive with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2726.77s">With</a>  curb, you can't go out as far with it because you truly have to accommodate trucks and buses and emergency vehicles, whereas paint, <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2735.302s">You</a>  know, you're trying to get most of the motorists to follow that, but it still allows for it to be driven over. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2741.466s">So,</a>  you know, we'd love to do all of it with full design, but there are 730 plus streets and 1600 plus intersections. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2752.152s">So,</a>  you know, we're constantly trying to find different sources of, you know, funds for all these things that we want to do for the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2761.357s">And,</a>  you know, we've been pretty successful lately with a lot of <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2764.827s">grants</a>  that we've received. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2766.948s">And</a>  we hope to do that in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2768.708s">But</a>  I guess the answer is, we'd like to do permanent improvements everywhere if and when possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2779.051s">But</a>  these are strategies used in other communities as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2782.873s">And</a>  again, some people, there's different preferences. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2786.414s">But</a>  they are used in Boston, Cambridge, Somerville, Seattle, all over the US. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2794.195s">Let</a>  us know which ones you like and where you want them, and we'll try to do it.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2798.456s">Thanks,</a>  Todd. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2798.996s">And</a>  just another question. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2800.337s">It's</a>  not actually directly on this TNC appropriation, but I've gotten calls from a couple of residents concerned about access to their driveways. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2809.759s">They</a>  kind of live near some of these new cone projects, and they're having a difficult time getting in and out of their driveways. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2816.261s">Did</a>  you talk to abutters who might be disrupted by the new cones that have been put up about that?</p>

    <p>[Blake]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2822.722s">Yeah,</a>  I've had conversations with internal staff and abutters and everything to work through these things, because they're new to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2831.126s">So</a>  one at Boston and High contacted me and said, hey, I'm having difficulty going in on my driveway. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2838.09s">There's</a>  a cone there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2839.431s">And</a>  they were wondering. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2840.811s">They</a>  didn't want to just move it on their own without permission. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2844.233s">And</a>  I said, no, that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2845.634s">We'll</a>  move it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2846.755s">We're</a>  here to help any unintentional <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2850.066s">negative</a>  consequences is truly unintentional. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2853.048s">So</a>  we can move it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2854.908s">We</a>  can move it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2855.549s">They</a>  can move it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2856.469s">You</a>  know, as long as it's not in the travel lane, it's just meant to add a vertical element to get people to comply with the white lines, because if the vertical element's not there, they just drive right over it as they've always done. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2868.455s">So</a>  we heard, you know, Boston at High, that was the one I was speaking of last year on social media, it blew up that it was a big safety issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2876.059s">And</a>  we're trying to slow people down, make them take tighter turns. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2881.389s">Another</a>  one was at main at Albion really opposite Hicks and a resident owner there, I spoke to, and, you know, I asked her if the cones are new, she said, no, she thinks it's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2895.676s">And</a>  she mentioned about the street sweepers that she goes above and beyond and moves it and moves it back. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2901.579s">And</a>  I said, that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2902.579s">Thank</a>  you for doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2903.42s">You</a>  know, it's, it takes, as people said in the committee meeting, <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2908.075s">it</a>  takes all of us to work together. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2909.816s">And</a>  yeah, that's one thing I do want to say about all this stuff, anything you see on the street, it's truly with the intent to help improve. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2919.221s">It's</a>  not meant to be, you know, negatively impact anyone's lives in any way. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2925.285s">Although</a>  with that being said, sometimes there are known trade-offs, not for that particular project, but you know, in other cases, when you do, you know, there's certain things in the right away that have to be <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2937.699s">trade</a>  it, like parking versus bump up versus bike lane versus, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2942.425s">So</a>  sometimes there are known impacts like that, but that's not the intent.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2949.735s">I</a>  think that's the exact tone to approach this with, Todd. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2954.1s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2957.179s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Bears, Vice President Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2960.282s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2961.003s">Todd,</a>  just a quick thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2962.985s">You</a>  painted some bump outs on Golden Avenue at the beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2972.094s">And</a>  those cones are just crushed that you put up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2979.184s">have</a>  those replaced, I mean, I think there was like four or five, I think like six of them, and I think there's only one left standing, they're all kind of just bent over on the ground, so if you could at least replace those?</p>

    <p>[Blake]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2992.727s">Yeah,</a>  that one, there were four, they will definitely look into that.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2996.168s">Yeah,</a>  they're just crushed.</p>

    <p>[Blake]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2997.708s">That</a>  was a case where there are signs saying no trucks, but compliance-wise, I guess, you know, people weren't necessarily satisfied with the compliance, so.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3007.351s">Well,</a>  the trucks just ran them over.</p>

    <p>[Blake]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3009.52s">Yeah,</a>  it was another attempt to paint bump outs to give the visual impression of a more narrow side street and also the vertical cones. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3019.802s">And</a>  that will happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3020.642s">And</a>  that's why we went with the movable ones at first so that we could play around the position of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3028.044s">And</a>  maybe if we choose ones that stick, we'll position a little further back. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3033.837s">These</a>  are the things that we're trying to do to help folks.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3035.619s">Well,</a>  I say, if you could replace them, it would be, the residents over there would appreciate that.</p>

    <p>[Blake]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3041.505s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3042.146s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3042.686s">Thank</a>  you, Vice President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3046.791s">Todd,</a>  if I may ask really quick, and I may, maybe I missed this, but you had, when Councilor Scarpelli was asking about the, the various, <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3056.906s">we'll</a>  call them cones or the sticks that we'll put up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3060.807s">And</a>  you made it sound like, I think you said if we head in that direction, making it sound like those will be permanent. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3066.509s">Am</a>  I correct?</p>

    <p>[Blake]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3069.029s">Well,</a>  these are options available to the city again, cheaper than curbing because curbing a curbs bump out at one corner of an intersection might run you 10 to $20,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3080.893s">And</a>  these are, you know, hundreds or, or, you know, a thousand dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3085.394s">So</a>  it's like, <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3086.786s">cost</a>  effective measures to try to get the same impact without impacting drainage and things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3092.318s">So</a>  the cones, you could either just paint the bump outs. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3097.318s">White,</a>  you could paint them with tan color as we just did in Medford at Albion on one corner just to show an example. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3105.621s">You</a>  could do that with or without cones or flex posts. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3109.302s">The</a>  flex posts and the cones, what they do is they add a vertical element. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3113.643s">So</a>  originally when we painted the heights in Boston at high with just paint, <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3119.537s">We</a>  didn't really hear about it because people could just still drive over it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3122.539s">So,</a>  you know, with the vertical element, it adds that other flavor and they kind of have to comply. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3127.662s">I</a>  mean, they could still, it's plastic, so they can still run over it, but at the risk of their vehicle. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3133.085s">So</a>  it's, you know, these are things that are meant to help with compliance.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3138.847s">So</a>  if I may, I completely understand the vertical element, but will the temporary vertical elements, which are the cones now be replaced by the more permanent vertical elements, which are drilled into the ground?</p>

    <p>[Blake]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3154.534s">The</a>  intent is to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3156.515s">And</a>  then because we're so close to the winter right now, so instead of two months and then they have to be removed, the intent is in the spring would go back and put in <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3165.689s">either</a>  screwed in or stuck to the ground with adhesive versions. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3169.71s">And</a>  those versions are more narrow and a little smaller, but the same color and the same idea.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3175.111s">Okay,</a>  so I understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3176.592s">So</a>  is the cost for those that are more permanent in nature, are those part of this here, or will there be funding that you'll be looking for in the spring for that?</p>

    <p>[Blake]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3187.755s">No,</a>  those were inclusive of the previous year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3190.075s">So</a>  Boston High was in one of the last year's list in Fulton. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3194.336s">So</a>  I'll say they're permanent in the sense that they last about nine months and they'll have to be redone every year and last about nine months each year because it's ongoing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3206.065s">So.</a> </p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3208.988s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3210.048s">So</a>  I thank you so much for all your hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3212.991s">I</a>  believe Aleesha wants to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3214.973s">Aleesha,</a>  I'm trying to unmute you.</p>

    <p>[Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3221.078s">There</a>  you go. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3221.937s">Thank</a>  you, Council President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3223.157s">Yeah,</a>  I just wanted to follow up on Councilor Scarpelli's request for funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3227.439s">Last</a>  year, it was 122, 122.90. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3230.3s">So</a>  it's actually increased by 14,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3233.081s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Blake]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3238.882s">I</a>  think the, am I still on?</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3242.023s">Yes,</a>  you're still on, Todd.</p>

    <p>[Blake]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3243.864s">I</a>  think the explanation for that with the pandemic is that the fee went up, but the rides probably went down to a balance of, <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3251.924s">What</a>  did the fee go up to?</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3252.904s">I</a>  thought it was $0.10. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3255.065s">Do</a>  we know what the fee went up to? <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3260.827s">Todd,</a>  will you know the answer to that?</p>

    <p>[Blake]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3263.748s">I'd</a>  confirm with Aleesha, but I believe it went up to $0.20.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3267.609s">Oh,</a>  it's $0.20. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3268.97s">Oh,</a>  wow, that's a big drop from last year then.</p>

    <p>[Blake]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3271.091s">I'd</a>  confirm with Aleesha.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3272.531s">I</a>  think last year we got like $190,000 the year before, if I'm not mistaken, $192,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3281.667s">So</a>  yeah, that was a big drop. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3283.448s">I</a>  mean, and it was all relative to, you know, the COVID thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3288.629s">You</a>  know, people just stopped, you know, started saying, you know, we're using, so we should be happy that we even got that much money. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3294.311s">Thank</a>  God that they doubled the rate.</p>

    <p>[Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3298.153s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3298.593s">I</a>  didn't receive anything that said it doubled the rate, but I'll get back to you and look into that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3303.094s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3304.355s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3305.506s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3306.166s">Move</a>  approval, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3307.086s">Okay,</a>  on the motion, okay, so there was a B paper, which was offered by Councilor Marks, and I believe that was seconded by Vice President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3315.628s">On</a>  that motion, Clerk Hurtubise, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3663.935s">Right,</a>  20 years old.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3665.375s">Three,</a>  four years ago, he started this mission where he began collecting World War II artifacts, World War II uniforms and the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3675.859s">And</a>  that morphed into this veteran's preservation project where Noah goes, <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3681.241s">all</a>  across Massachusetts, all across New England, showing off his wares at various town hall meetings, veterans meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3689.529s">Along</a>  with the artifacts that he has, he also has many stories that go along with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3695.634s">And</a>  it's just very impressive, Mr. President, that a kid at such a young age has shown such a commitment. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3701.9s">to</a>  furthering the memory of veterans here in Massachusetts, in Medford, and beyond. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3708.866s">So</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, I do think it might make sense for us to invite Noah down and honor him with a citation based upon the success of the Veterans Preservation Project. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3720.155s">And</a>  I'd offer that in full of a motion.</p>
