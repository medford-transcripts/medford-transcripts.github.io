00:00:00,996 --> 00:00:12,202
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, everyone, and welcome to the November slash December 2024 meeting for the Commission for Persons with Disabilities.

2
00:00:12,943 --> 00:00:16,985
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Frances Marger, DEI Director with the City of Medford.

3
00:00:17,545 --> 00:00:18,286
[SPEAKER_00]: Over to you, Sue.

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:42,173
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, I am Susan Bibbins, Commissioner, and I have lived in, I live in South Medford, and I've been a Commissioner for as many years as I can remember.

5
00:00:44,594 --> 00:00:46,335
[SPEAKER_03]: Over to you, Kate and Joe.

6
00:00:49,148 --> 00:00:52,389
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, I'll find that magic button in a minute.

7
00:00:53,350 --> 00:01:04,634
[SPEAKER_02]: Joe Casey lived in Medford my whole life, lived in a couple of other cities off and on, but a commissioner for about a year and a half now or a year.

8
00:01:05,494 --> 00:01:07,075
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm just here to help out.

9
00:01:10,076 --> 00:01:10,916
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Joe.

10
00:01:11,056 --> 00:01:13,657
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a guest on with us today.

11
00:01:14,197 --> 00:01:16,358
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you like to introduce yourself, John?

12
00:01:17,048 --> 00:01:18,869
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, hi, I'm John Shea.

13
00:01:19,569 --> 00:01:24,631
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a Medford resident, been living here 14, 15 years, lived in Somerville before that.

14
00:01:25,771 --> 00:01:31,433
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm fairly recently disabled, meaning because of diabetes, I had my leg amputated.

15
00:01:32,494 --> 00:01:39,176
[SPEAKER_04]: So, and I've gone blind three times this past year because of diabetes or diabetes.

16
00:01:39,636 --> 00:01:46,619
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I was curious about this committee and I was hoping to see what you've been able to achieve and what your goals are and what you accomplish.

17
00:01:47,324 --> 00:01:47,804
[SPEAKER_04]: And thank you.

18
00:01:50,666 --> 00:01:53,848
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for joining us, Joe.

19
00:01:55,229 --> 00:02:04,315
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, you know, you said you're curious about the committee, what we've been able to accomplish and what our goals are.

20
00:02:05,156 --> 00:02:09,459
[SPEAKER_00]: So this committee is brought forth by ordinance.

21
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:15,043
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say that because some committees are brought forth by

22
00:02:15,903 --> 00:02:21,245
[SPEAKER_00]: strictly community entities like non-profit organizations within a community.

23
00:02:21,825 --> 00:02:25,146
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are mandated by governance like state.

24
00:02:25,626 --> 00:02:29,208
[SPEAKER_00]: So ours is written in via ordinance.

25
00:02:30,408 --> 00:02:37,070
[SPEAKER_00]: It has parameters in which we do the work, right?

26
00:02:37,571 --> 00:02:40,932
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reality is that it is supposed to be

27
00:02:42,033 --> 00:02:54,668
[SPEAKER_00]: representative or on behalf of those who live, work and do business and school in the city of Medford that have a disability or identify as having a disability.

28
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:57,150
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is everything from

29
00:02:58,415 --> 00:03:06,197
[SPEAKER_00]: The most recent one, because you mentioned blindness, somebody reaching out because they need large print, right?

30
00:03:06,237 --> 00:03:15,199
[SPEAKER_00]: They qualify for a residential exemption or, yeah, I think that's the word, some sort of exemption or abatement, right?

31
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:22,021
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they have a certificate of blindness on their real estate tax and they need large print.

32
00:03:22,521 --> 00:03:24,562
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the thing, that form,

33
00:03:26,144 --> 00:03:28,469
[SPEAKER_00]: does not belong to the city, right?

34
00:03:29,211 --> 00:03:30,954
[SPEAKER_00]: It belongs to the state.

35
00:03:32,537 --> 00:03:35,318
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is no large print, right?

36
00:03:35,338 --> 00:03:36,698
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a thing that comes out.

37
00:03:37,278 --> 00:03:56,363
[SPEAKER_00]: So yours truly does things like gets the form and uses the copy machine to expand it to the fullest potential, of course, while communicating with the individual to ensure that the individual has access to information.

38
00:03:57,143 --> 00:04:11,517
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, such specifics may not be spelled out in the audience, but I don't wash my hands and say, oh, I'm sorry, that's not my job, that's a state form, you need to go figure it out with the state.

39
00:04:12,258 --> 00:04:16,462
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't help anybody, doesn't create a sense of belonging.

40
00:04:17,483 --> 00:04:21,147
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be it's things such as my colleague,

41
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:28,383
[SPEAKER_00]: Sue and I have attended the Community Access Monitoring Training.

42
00:04:29,124 --> 00:04:30,484
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a two-day training.

43
00:04:31,005 --> 00:04:32,265
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty intense.

44
00:04:32,506 --> 00:04:33,786
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty technical.

45
00:04:34,427 --> 00:04:51,696
[SPEAKER_00]: It's put on by the Mass Office on Disabilities, and it covers everything from the width of doorways, right, to accessible parking, and whether you're parking straight or you're parking at an angle.

46
00:04:53,112 --> 00:04:58,377
[SPEAKER_00]: what the minimum, because people hear ADA and they think, oh, the ADA is the set standard.

47
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:04,603
[SPEAKER_00]: No, the ADA is the minimum that you need to strive for.

48
00:05:05,524 --> 00:05:13,851
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're ADA compliant, it's not a big whoo, it means that we're a

49
00:05:14,807 --> 00:05:21,449
[SPEAKER_00]: the basic, now we want to get above that, such as our inclusive park at McGlynn.

50
00:05:22,009 --> 00:05:30,071
[SPEAKER_00]: So that, you know, my colleagues' attendance and mine at the CAM training, it's not written into ordinance, right?

51
00:05:30,472 --> 00:05:39,694
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we're talking about representing and supporting, we have to be willing to expand our own knowledge.

52
00:05:42,566 --> 00:05:44,528
[SPEAKER_00]: What else have we done, Sue and Joe?

53
00:05:44,548 --> 00:05:46,390
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, so many things.

54
00:05:47,411 --> 00:05:49,853
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe Nicholas reached out to you, John.

55
00:05:50,674 --> 00:05:52,055
[SPEAKER_00]: Nicholas is an intern.

56
00:05:52,635 --> 00:05:54,477
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, he sent me a nice email.

57
00:05:54,517 --> 00:05:56,099
[SPEAKER_04]: He was very helpful about transportation.

58
00:05:56,139 --> 00:05:56,359
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

59
00:05:58,235 --> 00:06:01,576
[SPEAKER_00]: So Nicholas is an intern that works out of my office.

60
00:06:02,277 --> 00:06:08,159
[SPEAKER_00]: Nicholas has taken on a lot of the site roles.

61
00:06:08,299 --> 00:06:20,805
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the roles that require me to look at site plans for new development, or go and look at sites themselves.

62
00:06:23,821 --> 00:06:28,829
[SPEAKER_00]: So Nicholas has taken over that because if I'm going out,

63
00:06:30,825 --> 00:06:35,126
[SPEAKER_00]: there is a backlog that is occurring.

64
00:06:35,167 --> 00:06:53,973
[SPEAKER_00]: Nicholas has also taken over like the internal being a support on site in regards to questions around accessibility within City Hall, which is a public building and working with the schools as well on their accessibility needs.

65
00:06:55,153 --> 00:06:56,354
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are so many,

66
00:06:58,177 --> 00:07:03,601
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many aspects, right, to supporting people with disabilities.

67
00:07:04,502 --> 00:07:09,225
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't talked about the support for people whose disabilities are not visible.

68
00:07:11,106 --> 00:07:13,868
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, folks that are neurodivergent.

69
00:07:13,928 --> 00:07:23,335
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of work that I do on the internal side as far as providing the education, because we have to start somewhere.

70
00:07:26,188 --> 00:07:30,250
[SPEAKER_00]: ensuring that there is access to like our job postings.

71
00:07:34,372 --> 00:07:40,995
[SPEAKER_00]: Just now, just when I ran away for a little bit, it was because 12 cheers had arrived.

72
00:07:41,675 --> 00:07:50,720
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't just regular cheers, but it was the fact that one day I noticed one of my colleagues struggling to get up from the chairs in the chambers.

73
00:07:51,898 --> 00:07:54,099
[SPEAKER_00]: which is where we hold the public meetings.

74
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:59,341
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I looked around, I realized that none of those shears have arms.

75
00:08:01,442 --> 00:08:05,864
[SPEAKER_00]: And the ones that do have arms are big, bulky, and have wheels.

76
00:08:07,485 --> 00:08:18,290
[SPEAKER_00]: So we used ARPA funding to get 12 sets, a set of 12, so that at least that way they would be sprinkled around.

77
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:19,010
[SPEAKER_00]: Go right ahead.

78
00:08:19,855 --> 00:08:22,938
[SPEAKER_04]: So is there funding for this committee to achieve its work?

79
00:08:22,998 --> 00:08:24,759
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you work through the city council?

80
00:08:24,779 --> 00:08:26,220
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, how does this work?

81
00:08:27,722 --> 00:08:36,489
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have used ARPA funding, which ends on the 31st of this year, right?

82
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:43,796
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've used a tremendous amount of ARPA funding to bring us up to date in terms of our language access.

83
00:08:44,296 --> 00:08:57,163
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we need ASL interpreters, if we need documents to be translated, I've used that to cover, I've used that to make certain purchases such as the chairs that I just mentioned.

84
00:08:58,144 --> 00:09:09,610
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also made a purchase and upgraded the assistive technology and devices in the chambers.

85
00:09:11,311 --> 00:09:13,632
[SPEAKER_00]: Whilst we had some,

86
00:09:17,593 --> 00:09:20,995
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we had some, it's pretty much, right?

87
00:09:21,515 --> 00:09:22,355
[SPEAKER_03]: They were there.

88
00:09:23,135 --> 00:09:24,176
[SPEAKER_00]: They were there, right?

89
00:09:24,716 --> 00:09:28,818
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I know that we have a brand new set.

90
00:09:29,298 --> 00:09:31,479
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the receiver.

91
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,320
[SPEAKER_00]: It's modern.

92
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:38,582
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be synced with a variety of different avenues.

93
00:09:39,403 --> 00:09:44,425
[SPEAKER_00]: Our media production manager, Kevin Harrington,

94
00:09:45,414 --> 00:09:49,835
[SPEAKER_00]: was present when we did a walkthrough and when we made the selection.

95
00:09:50,435 --> 00:09:53,436
[SPEAKER_00]: So he knows exactly what we're going to be working with.

96
00:09:54,016 --> 00:09:58,818
[SPEAKER_00]: We have brand new, what do they call the receiver kits?

97
00:09:58,858 --> 00:10:00,158
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very, very small.

98
00:10:00,818 --> 00:10:05,199
[SPEAKER_00]: You can clip them on or you can, you know, wear them as a necklace.

99
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,940
[SPEAKER_00]: All brand new, everything works.

100
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,521
[SPEAKER_00]: I went with rechargeable batteries and a battery charger.

101
00:10:12,066 --> 00:10:12,747
[SPEAKER_00]: and headphones.

102
00:10:13,607 --> 00:10:16,910
[SPEAKER_00]: If somebody needs one, they can just request one.

103
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:17,691
[SPEAKER_00]: It's there.

104
00:10:17,731 --> 00:10:18,751
[SPEAKER_00]: We know it works.

105
00:10:18,871 --> 00:10:19,812
[SPEAKER_00]: We know it's new.

106
00:10:20,493 --> 00:10:25,377
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have to look around looking for what part is here and what part isn't.

107
00:10:25,577 --> 00:10:27,058
[SPEAKER_00]: What will happen in the future?

108
00:10:27,138 --> 00:10:27,638
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

109
00:10:27,778 --> 00:10:32,062
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be a request that would need to be made.

110
00:10:32,322 --> 00:10:37,886
[SPEAKER_00]: When I say this, I want to make sure that folks understand that there is no such thing as having a budget.

111
00:10:38,837 --> 00:10:40,778
[SPEAKER_00]: for accessibility, right?

112
00:10:41,258 --> 00:10:50,423
[SPEAKER_00]: There are laws that we need to meet, and if the need arises, it is our responsibility to figure out how to support that need.

113
00:10:51,563 --> 00:11:02,309
[SPEAKER_00]: I could say, oh, I need $10,000 for this work, and it just so happens that that budget year, there's no need, and I've only used 500.

114
00:11:02,849 --> 00:11:04,610
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see what I'm saying?

115
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:07,832
[SPEAKER_00]: Or the need surpasses it.

116
00:11:08,766 --> 00:11:26,738
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've done my due diligence to make sure that whether it's the library that's having an event or the senior center that's having an event, if ASL interpretation is requested, I have reached out to the Mass Commission for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing.

117
00:11:27,699 --> 00:11:36,745
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if they're not able to fulfill, it is important that we put our requests in through them because that helps them monitor

118
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:43,952
[SPEAKER_00]: what the need is, because ASL interpreters are contractors.

119
00:11:44,973 --> 00:11:46,575
[SPEAKER_00]: They're independent contractors.

120
00:11:47,508 --> 00:11:55,154
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not like it's a language, right, option that people can take in school so they graduate and they get certified.

121
00:11:55,634 --> 00:12:03,000
[SPEAKER_00]: And if somebody's asking to come to a meeting, I can't, you know, my friend of a friend is not a professional.

122
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:06,963
[SPEAKER_00]: These interpreters are trained professionals, right?

123
00:12:07,464 --> 00:12:08,805
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I had a

124
00:12:09,769 --> 00:12:24,413
[SPEAKER_00]: If I was of Latino descent and I required ASL interpretation, I would be looking for somebody who would be more familiar with the Latino style of speaking, which translates into the Latino style of interpreting.

125
00:12:25,993 --> 00:12:27,254
[SPEAKER_00]: So many different nuances.

126
00:12:27,774 --> 00:12:31,475
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not fully there, but we are moving forward.

127
00:12:32,442 --> 00:12:33,003
[SPEAKER_00]: steadily.

128
00:12:35,105 --> 00:12:36,527
[SPEAKER_00]: What else has the committee done?

129
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:40,491
[SPEAKER_00]: It's reviewed stuff from the MBTA.

130
00:12:42,994 --> 00:12:47,319
[SPEAKER_03]: We've done lots of advocating and

131
00:12:52,173 --> 00:13:17,412
[SPEAKER_03]: We've done lots of advocating and pushing to get the Medford commuter rail station fixed up and accessibility at the Medford commuter rail station on near Placedead Road.

132
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:26,897
[SPEAKER_03]: And I believe construction starts next fall or this summer.

133
00:13:28,838 --> 00:13:34,922
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they put something down already, but after 14 plus years is my understanding.

134
00:13:35,322 --> 00:13:35,562
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

135
00:13:35,662 --> 00:13:39,465
[SPEAKER_00]: And heavy advocacy from this commission.

136
00:13:39,865 --> 00:13:40,165
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

137
00:13:40,245 --> 00:13:48,070
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition with state rep, Sean Garberly, who really helped to support this commission's advocacy.

138
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:48,791
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

139
00:13:51,329 --> 00:14:12,258
[SPEAKER_03]: We did a accessibility fair last October, I think it was, which was very well-loved.

140
00:14:12,578 --> 00:14:13,438
[SPEAKER_03]: We worked on

141
00:14:22,211 --> 00:14:32,099
[SPEAKER_03]: We consulted with the Planning and Playgrounds Commission on a number of parks and playgrounds.

142
00:14:34,662 --> 00:14:35,863
[SPEAKER_04]: What did you do with the playgrounds?

143
00:14:37,964 --> 00:14:46,352
[SPEAKER_03]: We consulted what personally and as a commission we'd like to see.

144
00:14:48,452 --> 00:14:57,657
[SPEAKER_03]: um, as accessibility wise and as accessible playground and play spaces.

145
00:15:00,118 --> 00:15:13,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so, you know, um, equipment and, um, spaces around and, um,

146
00:15:16,477 --> 00:15:22,542
[SPEAKER_03]: We consulted with the Medford McGlynn space.

147
00:15:24,224 --> 00:15:28,567
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we consulted with Carr Park.

148
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:35,573
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we consulted with another park that I don't remember the name of.

149
00:15:36,094 --> 00:15:36,274
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

150
00:15:39,555 --> 00:15:46,418
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't get all the things that we were suggesting, but they came to us in consultation.

151
00:15:48,258 --> 00:16:03,725
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of people come to, a lot of people or planners come to us in consultation and say, what would you like

152
00:16:05,378 --> 00:16:10,761
[SPEAKER_03]: what would you like to see in this space?

153
00:16:12,683 --> 00:16:26,571
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we got, you know, we see a little of it or don't see anything or see a lot of it when the final thing is built.

154
00:16:30,703 --> 00:16:35,186
[SPEAKER_03]: We're, you know, we just, but we make recommendations.

155
00:16:36,686 --> 00:16:38,007
[SPEAKER_04]: You have a voice, that's good.

156
00:16:39,147 --> 00:16:56,756
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, we do a lot of advocacy for streets and lights and sidewalks and stuff like that.

157
00:16:59,805 --> 00:17:08,373
[SPEAKER_03]: I've done a lot of things with the traffic commission and sometimes that speeds it up.

158
00:17:09,674 --> 00:17:16,000
[SPEAKER_03]: Most times they ignore me, but it helps me see when to react.

159
00:17:22,722 --> 00:17:26,727
[SPEAKER_00]: The visibility and advocacy piece is important.

160
00:17:28,129 --> 00:17:38,500
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't speak for the rest of my colleagues, but for me, the end goal is not about whether or not you take my recommendation.

161
00:17:39,321 --> 00:17:43,427
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't take my recommendation if I'm not invited to the table.

162
00:17:44,008 --> 00:17:51,318
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's more important to me personally that you know when to reach out to the Disability Commission.

163
00:17:53,115 --> 00:17:56,359
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really on almost everything.

164
00:17:56,479 --> 00:18:05,990
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, even things that I handle in my body of work, if I think it crosses over into the commission, it's on the agenda for the next meeting.

165
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:09,775
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will say, yes, I received, you know.

166
00:18:10,295 --> 00:18:16,742
[SPEAKER_00]: five complaints about somebody parking in the accessible spot and it's the same spot.

167
00:18:17,082 --> 00:18:30,175
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went out and called the police and people got ticketed, you know, or, yeah, you know, that horrible interception that has no curb cut is going to be getting a curb cut.

168
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:35,138
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, because or sometimes there are things that are code enforcement related.

169
00:18:35,718 --> 00:18:36,038
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

170
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:39,859
[SPEAKER_00]: We might see it now as the weather is getting colder.

171
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:44,681
[SPEAKER_00]: People will bring their barrels out because it's, you know, it's rubbish pickup day.

172
00:18:45,181 --> 00:18:48,803
[SPEAKER_00]: So that cuts the width of the sidewalk.

173
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:54,845
[SPEAKER_00]: But then they also haven't shoveled or they shoveled haphazardly.

174
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:59,587
[SPEAKER_00]: And somebody is in some sort of device that needs to use the sidewalk and they can't.

175
00:19:00,835 --> 00:19:09,320
[SPEAKER_00]: and then I get a call, you know, then that, you know, trans something like that transfers over and involves code enforcement.

176
00:19:09,901 --> 00:19:19,487
[SPEAKER_00]: So small group, but mighty and also mighty in terms of lived experience, in terms of knowledge.

177
00:19:21,068 --> 00:19:24,830
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of us have been doing this from when the ride was free.

178
00:19:26,802 --> 00:19:31,246
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there was a time when the MBTA ride was free.

179
00:19:33,207 --> 00:19:40,293
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it was 50 cents you paid to have your support person ride with you, but it was still free for you.

180
00:19:42,094 --> 00:19:43,996
[SPEAKER_00]: How long has this commission or community been around?

181
00:19:47,677 --> 00:19:50,738
[SPEAKER_00]: commission since I first longest I've been with the city.

182
00:19:51,479 --> 00:19:55,400
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think that the commission I can look and see the date of the ordinance.

183
00:19:56,081 --> 00:19:58,202
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, unless I'm just curious.

184
00:19:58,442 --> 00:20:00,422
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been on the commission.

185
00:20:00,502 --> 00:20:06,645
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, um, since 2015 or 14.

186
00:20:06,725 --> 00:20:06,925
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

187
00:20:06,945 --> 00:20:07,365
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and

188
00:20:20,869 --> 00:20:25,211
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know it was spanning years before that.

189
00:20:29,314 --> 00:20:29,674
[SPEAKER_03]: So.

190
00:20:30,674 --> 00:20:31,755
[SPEAKER_04]: Joe, have you been on for a long time?

191
00:20:34,756 --> 00:20:35,056
[SPEAKER_00]: Joe?

192
00:20:36,337 --> 00:20:36,617
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

193
00:20:37,998 --> 00:20:40,239
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you been on the commission for a long time?

194
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:43,841
[SPEAKER_00]: John was asking.

195
00:20:44,381 --> 00:20:46,562
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I said about a year, year and a half.

196
00:20:47,102 --> 00:20:47,263
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

197
00:20:50,294 --> 00:20:52,315
[SPEAKER_02]: I should have added it earlier.

198
00:20:52,435 --> 00:21:01,122
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a 32-year-old son that had two brain surgeries, and he's got a major handicap.

199
00:21:02,002 --> 00:21:05,245
[SPEAKER_02]: And what was it?

200
00:21:06,566 --> 00:21:15,892
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm grateful that I've been fairly healthy, but for about a year's time, I was in crutches and things like that.

201
00:21:17,329 --> 00:21:27,236
[SPEAKER_02]: I just couldn't believe how people going into stores or people not holding the door for me or things like that on crutches.

202
00:21:27,616 --> 00:21:29,017
[SPEAKER_02]: It was quite an awareness.

203
00:21:29,337 --> 00:21:30,958
[SPEAKER_02]: I just couldn't believe it.

204
00:21:34,381 --> 00:21:38,864
[SPEAKER_02]: I forget what school.

205
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:42,386
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's Belmont has a program

206
00:21:43,691 --> 00:21:45,993
[SPEAKER_02]: at the high school, they have 25 wheelchairs.

207
00:21:46,053 --> 00:21:49,436
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess they asked the kids to spend the day in a wheelchair.

208
00:21:50,737 --> 00:21:54,240
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was a great idea.

209
00:21:54,501 --> 00:21:56,402
[SPEAKER_02]: And the kids get to know what it's like.

210
00:21:57,583 --> 00:21:59,926
[SPEAKER_02]: And what is it?

211
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:13,415
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I know I'm old school and I got to catch up with things, but I did work in a building that had to be handicap compliant with the updated stuff.

212
00:22:13,495 --> 00:22:14,396
[SPEAKER_02]: And I learned a lot.

213
00:22:15,176 --> 00:22:23,480
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, I also have a contractor's license that I learned a lot of special building codes that, uh, my handicap assessabilities.

214
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:28,222
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know, like, uh, kind of like a little bit of everything.

215
00:22:29,503 --> 00:22:30,063
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but.

216
00:22:31,458 --> 00:22:37,543
[SPEAKER_02]: Big part of my life is having a handicapped person in my family.

217
00:22:38,424 --> 00:22:40,485
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's all types of handicaps.

218
00:22:40,566 --> 00:22:45,610
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of them, like people keep saying, they're not always visual.

219
00:22:46,851 --> 00:22:53,756
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just think a lot of people just don't have the awareness.

220
00:22:56,309 --> 00:23:00,252
[SPEAKER_02]: of other people that might have different disabilities.

221
00:23:00,572 --> 00:23:00,852
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

222
00:23:03,033 --> 00:23:12,019
[SPEAKER_00]: Joe, it's a good thing you didn't need to take the commuter rail, because if you did, Joe, you would have had to fly up from your crutches.

223
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,060
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

224
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,742
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I used to work in Boston for 25 years.

225
00:23:17,383 --> 00:23:18,944
[SPEAKER_02]: I took the commuter stuff a lot.

226
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:19,124
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

227
00:23:19,903 --> 00:23:26,006
[SPEAKER_00]: when I went because I kept, I was told that it wasn't accessible and none of it made sense to me, right?

228
00:23:26,706 --> 00:23:30,007
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, you know, 2022, it's got to be.

229
00:23:30,247 --> 00:23:31,748
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you mean it's not accessible?

230
00:23:31,828 --> 00:23:35,489
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, oh, you know, maybe they don't like the car and stuff.

231
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:37,070
[SPEAKER_00]: No, there is a lip.

232
00:23:40,325 --> 00:23:44,368
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, not a non-noticeable one.

233
00:23:44,969 --> 00:23:52,814
[SPEAKER_00]: Enough of a difference that if even they dropped a little ramp, gravity itself would tip you over.

234
00:23:52,834 --> 00:23:55,576
[SPEAKER_00]: If you, yeah.

235
00:23:56,337 --> 00:23:57,718
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it became a...

236
00:23:59,607 --> 00:24:13,077
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they touched it the way the federal law was written, because they were using some sort of federal grant monies, they had to sort of like circumvent some style of law that was the holdup.

237
00:24:13,237 --> 00:24:27,688
[SPEAKER_00]: All I know is I was happy earlier on this year when we got the invite and I saw that Medford was one of the 14 communities selected to have work start on the community route.

238
00:24:28,528 --> 00:24:32,590
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and people might say, well, what is the big deal?

239
00:24:33,051 --> 00:24:37,033
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it is a big deal when you talk about accessibility, right?

240
00:24:37,453 --> 00:24:46,378
[SPEAKER_00]: If somebody has a job in Boston, right, the community rail might be the straight point for them to go from their home location into work.

241
00:24:46,778 --> 00:24:49,840
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that option is eliminated for them.

242
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,782
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not so easy as doing a workaround.

243
00:24:55,183 --> 00:24:55,563
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?

244
00:24:55,583 --> 00:24:57,524
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's getting us to

245
00:24:58,078 --> 00:25:10,750
[SPEAKER_00]: think in terms of not all we need to make sure things are accessible, but we need to make sure that the tools that we use or things that are created are created for all people.

246
00:25:12,456 --> 00:25:30,570
[SPEAKER_00]: The roads need to be for all people, whether you walk, whether you're in a carriage, whether you're the person driving the stroller, whether you're in your motorized scooter, whether you're in your walker, whether you're in your power chair, you still need to feel comfortable on the road.

247
00:25:31,911 --> 00:25:36,855
[SPEAKER_00]: The curb, the area for the curb cut needs to be wide enough.

248
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:49,493
[SPEAKER_00]: and at a gentle enough gradient, not where you go and your back's like this and you're trying to hold on to your baby carriage because it's so steep, right?

249
00:25:49,573 --> 00:25:53,257
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all things where, you know, when you have

250
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:55,658
[SPEAKER_00]: Typical house, right?

251
00:25:56,078 --> 00:25:57,639
[SPEAKER_00]: It's heat two feet walk.

252
00:25:58,019 --> 00:26:17,430
[SPEAKER_00]: You can feel the bottom of the ground as you're walking Doesn't concern you but a change like that is major major for people who don't who can't sense the bottom of their feet Yeah, you know and these are things that get taken for granted

253
00:26:18,888 --> 00:26:34,692
[SPEAKER_00]: So small but mighty voices here need to be the ones that say, hey, on behalf of all those others who you haven't thought about, you know, they bring those issues forward.

254
00:26:34,792 --> 00:26:39,674
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I also have to make sure that I don't just sit and twiddle my thumbs.

255
00:26:40,214 --> 00:26:44,235
[SPEAKER_00]: My knowledge doesn't stop because the stuff doesn't come naturally to me.

256
00:26:44,768 --> 00:26:44,988
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

257
00:26:45,048 --> 00:26:47,509
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like, oh, there's this giant office.

258
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:53,752
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have to make sure that I'm engaged in my local trainings, my state trainings, my federal trainings.

259
00:26:54,052 --> 00:26:55,553
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm up to date on the law.

260
00:26:55,933 --> 00:26:58,174
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's at the point where I've given up now.

261
00:26:58,834 --> 00:27:05,958
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything, I just put them all in a manual because there is nothing, no space left to retain.

262
00:27:06,658 --> 00:27:06,898
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?

263
00:27:06,938 --> 00:27:11,540
[SPEAKER_00]: So that that information is always accessible and always current.

264
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:23,904
[SPEAKER_00]: And if, you know, somebody from DPW comes in and I'm not around, Nick can point them to the manual and they can look at the, you know, look at the, what you call it, the numbers that they want.

265
00:27:24,944 --> 00:27:27,405
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's everything down to our lighting.

266
00:27:27,825 --> 00:27:31,667
[SPEAKER_00]: People don't realize that it's coding around lighting.

267
00:27:32,883 --> 00:27:39,245
[SPEAKER_00]: My big one right now, my big project, I'm working very closely with our facilities director.

268
00:27:39,265 --> 00:27:40,945
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to do something with the loos.

269
00:27:41,926 --> 00:27:46,427
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the loos need to be accessible for all people.

270
00:27:46,447 --> 00:27:48,207
[SPEAKER_00]: What needs to be accessible?

271
00:27:48,807 --> 00:27:50,068
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'm sorry, the bathrooms.

272
00:27:50,488 --> 00:27:50,948
[SPEAKER_00]: Toilets.

273
00:27:51,388 --> 00:27:53,009
[SPEAKER_00]: I said loos, sorry.

274
00:27:53,549 --> 00:27:54,309
[SPEAKER_00]: The bathrooms.

275
00:27:55,249 --> 00:27:55,429
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

276
00:27:56,529 --> 00:27:59,730
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they need to be accessible for all people.

277
00:28:00,391 --> 00:28:01,731
[SPEAKER_00]: And these things are...

278
00:28:03,561 --> 00:28:06,522
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, they're expensive, right?

279
00:28:07,123 --> 00:28:11,444
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm not doing it because I want fancy aesthetics.

280
00:28:12,285 --> 00:28:20,548
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing it because anybody who wants to use the loo should feel comfortable using it.

281
00:28:22,189 --> 00:28:23,930
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a public space.

282
00:28:24,648 --> 00:28:34,255
[SPEAKER_00]: So even if I just get to one, right, I'd much rather do one and do it right than hurry to get them done.

283
00:28:35,016 --> 00:28:37,618
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously, it wouldn't be me doing them.

284
00:28:37,658 --> 00:28:40,059
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to get a design consultant in there.

285
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,242
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a facilities director has to be involved.

286
00:28:43,622 --> 00:28:48,566
[SPEAKER_00]: Procurement has to be involved because we've got to figure out, OK, which vendor are we using?

287
00:28:48,926 --> 00:28:52,629
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you have to make sure that you're using the most up-to-date

288
00:28:54,212 --> 00:29:15,199
[SPEAKER_00]: items, you know, all these cute, fancy items that you might, you know, dream of or might want in your home, not considered accessible, you know, and even just something as simple as, you know, if it's an automatic thing and the water comes out, everything is measured, like the speed and stuff like that.

289
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:17,600
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

290
00:29:18,044 --> 00:29:22,427
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's like, that's the back end of what people don't see.

291
00:29:22,688 --> 00:29:28,913
[SPEAKER_00]: And all this, the big picture of all this falls under diversity, equity and inclusion.

292
00:29:28,993 --> 00:29:29,253
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?

293
00:29:29,773 --> 00:29:31,975
[SPEAKER_00]: Because DEI is civil rights.

294
00:29:32,455 --> 00:29:36,138
[SPEAKER_00]: Disabilities laws protected under the Civil Rights Act.

295
00:29:36,158 --> 00:29:38,260
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

296
00:29:40,468 --> 00:30:05,018
[SPEAKER_00]: So since we're here, I'll just let everybody know that we did get the grant for new lights over at City Hall, and they have actually, yes, I know, I'm very excited about that, and they have actually started to change the light fixtures in many offices, and the light fixture in mine, they've changed one, and I will say that it is a lot warmer,

297
00:30:06,278 --> 00:30:09,399
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't worked under it yet for a full day.

298
00:30:09,419 --> 00:30:16,041
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm told that once they change the second one, might be able to get dimmers.

299
00:30:16,181 --> 00:30:18,442
[SPEAKER_00]: So we shall see.

300
00:30:18,842 --> 00:30:21,383
[SPEAKER_00]: I might be able to work under typical lights.

301
00:30:21,963 --> 00:30:25,064
[SPEAKER_00]: for the first time in a very, very long time.

302
00:30:25,185 --> 00:30:28,146
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, these things are important.

303
00:30:29,246 --> 00:30:46,515
[SPEAKER_00]: And Paul and I continue to look at different, Paul is the facilities director for the city, so he is responsible for all the city buildings, but continuing to look at different ways that we can access funding,

304
00:30:47,215 --> 00:30:49,476
[SPEAKER_00]: to do things like the wayfinding.

305
00:30:50,016 --> 00:30:55,559
[SPEAKER_00]: We did apply for a grant through the MOD last year, and we didn't get it.

306
00:30:55,999 --> 00:31:02,243
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we applied in collaboration with the school department the year before, and we still didn't get it.

307
00:31:02,723 --> 00:31:05,344
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do need to update our wayfinding.

308
00:31:05,484 --> 00:31:07,986
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not up to code.

309
00:31:08,246 --> 00:31:13,108
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the way the Braille signs are, they're not done that way anymore.

310
00:31:13,668 --> 00:31:16,410
[SPEAKER_00]: So Paul and I are anxious to

311
00:31:18,775 --> 00:31:26,638
[SPEAKER_00]: get a move on things, but it is cost prohibitive right now.

312
00:31:26,738 --> 00:31:34,401
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll continue to look for grants, but our big focus in our primary one is, I will say attacking the bathrooms.

313
00:31:35,841 --> 00:31:38,242
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an attack on the bathrooms.

314
00:31:39,283 --> 00:31:41,924
[SPEAKER_00]: Not even upgrading, attacking the bathrooms.

315
00:31:42,704 --> 00:31:43,064
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

316
00:31:43,164 --> 00:31:45,325
[SPEAKER_04]: City Hall, what about the schools?

317
00:31:46,045 --> 00:31:47,166
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they accessible?

318
00:31:49,305 --> 00:31:57,390
[SPEAKER_00]: The schools should be, the schools were built at a different time.

319
00:31:57,410 --> 00:32:02,352
[SPEAKER_00]: The schools definitely would be more accessible than us.

320
00:32:02,872 --> 00:32:16,660
[SPEAKER_00]: We are also hampered by the fact that we were also designated a historic, I don't know, we have a designation as being a historic building.

321
00:32:19,695 --> 00:32:24,476
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's not enough for me for us to continue as is.

322
00:32:26,477 --> 00:32:27,797
[SPEAKER_03]: We're a public building.

323
00:32:27,957 --> 00:32:29,417
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.

324
00:32:29,657 --> 00:32:30,898
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

325
00:32:32,138 --> 00:32:34,998
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not enough to be a historic building.

326
00:32:35,439 --> 00:32:39,219
[SPEAKER_03]: It's for a public building that falls out the window.

327
00:32:39,739 --> 00:32:40,200
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.

328
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:41,100
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

329
00:32:42,772 --> 00:32:46,094
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, these are not, it's not Sue's decision.

330
00:32:46,174 --> 00:32:47,534
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not my decision.

331
00:32:47,895 --> 00:32:49,115
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the law.

332
00:32:50,096 --> 00:32:53,137
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and we, our elevator.

333
00:32:53,237 --> 00:33:02,242
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's my understanding that the elevator hadn't had proper TLC for a very, very long time.

334
00:33:03,162 --> 00:33:05,984
[SPEAKER_00]: It was consistently breaking down.

335
00:33:07,064 --> 00:33:09,826
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had it go out of service for about,

336
00:33:11,295 --> 00:33:14,836
[SPEAKER_00]: six to eight weeks, an intentional out of service.

337
00:33:15,416 --> 00:33:29,521
[SPEAKER_00]: And whilst we were able to maintain the facade of the interior, the behind the scenes, all the wiring was replaced and everything was brought up to date and up to code.

338
00:33:30,582 --> 00:33:30,762
[SPEAKER_00]: And

339
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:34,572
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of weeks ago we had a fire alarm.

340
00:33:34,692 --> 00:33:35,692
[SPEAKER_00]: The fire alarm went off.

341
00:33:36,293 --> 00:33:37,213
[SPEAKER_00]: It was not a drill.

342
00:33:37,393 --> 00:33:38,334
[SPEAKER_00]: It was unannounced.

343
00:33:38,354 --> 00:33:52,322
[SPEAKER_00]: The fire alarm went off and the elevator did what it was supposed to do, which was it went right to the first floor, opened its doors and remained there, refused to move, refused to obey any commands, just

344
00:33:53,082 --> 00:33:53,963
[SPEAKER_00]: remained as is.

345
00:33:54,043 --> 00:33:55,845
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a good way of testing.

346
00:33:56,445 --> 00:34:08,537
[SPEAKER_00]: But on the other side, there is a button that if you push the button, it connects you directly to our 911 services.

347
00:34:08,998 --> 00:34:12,021
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was fortunate enough to test that.

348
00:34:12,742 --> 00:34:15,384
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, the fire chief was in it with me because

349
00:34:16,343 --> 00:34:21,490
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want people coming coming out and thinking like oh my gosh you know something's happening.

350
00:34:22,031 --> 00:34:25,595
[SPEAKER_00]: So he radioed in to let them know that we were running the test.

351
00:34:26,877 --> 00:34:30,261
[SPEAKER_00]: And I pushed the button and it says help is on the way.

352
00:34:31,062 --> 00:34:31,984
[SPEAKER_00]: Help is on the way.

353
00:34:32,024 --> 00:34:33,506
[SPEAKER_00]: And then somebody answers.

354
00:34:33,586 --> 00:34:33,886
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

355
00:34:34,852 --> 00:34:40,276
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody answers and, you know, just able to say that we were, you know, just running a test.

356
00:34:41,357 --> 00:34:49,844
[SPEAKER_00]: But had we been on for not a longer period of time, other things would have happened as a result.

357
00:34:50,824 --> 00:34:52,506
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so I'm happy.

358
00:34:52,706 --> 00:34:53,947
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy about that.

359
00:34:55,168 --> 00:35:01,533
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine having a disability and being stuck in a lift by yourself, right?

360
00:35:03,221 --> 00:35:06,142
[SPEAKER_00]: no avenue, no ability to talk to anybody.

361
00:35:06,182 --> 00:35:09,704
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got your cell phone, your cell phone's on 30%.

362
00:35:09,784 --> 00:35:12,105
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you look at it, it's going down to 23.

363
00:35:12,565 --> 00:35:16,106
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's always in an emergency that the battery starts to leak power.

364
00:35:16,146 --> 00:35:18,067
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you look at it, it's down to 1%.

365
00:35:18,887 --> 00:35:23,869
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm not mistaken, I saw an outlet that you could plug something in.

366
00:35:26,438 --> 00:35:30,801
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's good, at least even just having somebody talk to you, I think.

367
00:35:31,582 --> 00:35:34,444
[SPEAKER_00]: But all that I learned is a result of the fire alarm.

368
00:35:35,385 --> 00:35:43,951
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned some other things, but... Do you have any other questions for us?

369
00:35:46,433 --> 00:35:53,058
[SPEAKER_04]: As far as reaching out to people that are blind, does the committee or the city send things out in Braille?

370
00:35:53,138 --> 00:35:54,779
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know who's blind in the city?

371
00:35:56,389 --> 00:35:58,630
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I know who is blind?

372
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:02,331
[SPEAKER_00]: The registration of who's blind and who needs it.

373
00:36:03,631 --> 00:36:08,913
[SPEAKER_00]: So the keeper of that information is mass commission for the blind.

374
00:36:09,293 --> 00:36:19,937
[SPEAKER_00]: Information that I have would be if people identify as having a disability, but that wouldn't be residents because I can't go up to a resident and be like,

375
00:36:20,117 --> 00:36:21,978
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, you have a disability, right?

376
00:36:22,558 --> 00:36:24,339
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do I need to ask that question?

377
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:30,143
[SPEAKER_00]: That is just like employees, and that's part of just EEO for tracking.

378
00:36:30,783 --> 00:36:34,885
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't identify the disability that you have.

379
00:36:35,006 --> 00:36:38,427
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just simple, a yes, no, I choose not to disclose.

380
00:36:38,968 --> 00:36:40,889
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, you know, the federal paperwork.

381
00:36:41,469 --> 00:36:56,622
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, on another hand, I work with employees, so when employees approach me for an ADA reasonable accommodation, I will know more about them as part of that process.

382
00:36:57,692 --> 00:36:59,994
[SPEAKER_00]: than other people would.

383
00:37:01,034 --> 00:37:10,221
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as people who are residents of the community, I wouldn't know unless somebody told me.

384
00:37:10,821 --> 00:37:19,607
[SPEAKER_00]: Mass Commission for the Blind would know because in order to get that certificate for the blind, you go through Mass Commission for the Blind.

385
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:25,333
[SPEAKER_00]: they're the keepers of those records.

386
00:37:25,473 --> 00:37:45,030
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure that if there was some legitimate reason, if we needed to get information out, let's say there was a federal thing or a state thing that we needed to get out to Medford residents who were visually impaired, I'm sure that they would partner with us in some way.

387
00:37:46,051 --> 00:37:49,814
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't think that it's just a simple, oh, here's a list of all the people.

388
00:37:51,682 --> 00:37:54,064
[SPEAKER_04]: So is the term visually impaired as opposed to blind now?

389
00:37:54,724 --> 00:37:56,066
[SPEAKER_00]: There are two different things.

390
00:37:57,467 --> 00:38:01,090
[SPEAKER_00]: There are people who are blind, right?

391
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:03,091
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like hearing impaired and deaf.

392
00:38:03,652 --> 00:38:06,554
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are people who are visually impaired.

393
00:38:07,194 --> 00:38:18,824
[SPEAKER_00]: So under visual impairments, you have depth perception, which is why we need to have good curb cuts, good sidewalks, actual gradients.

394
00:38:22,572 --> 00:38:24,253
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say colored markings.

395
00:38:24,313 --> 00:38:25,914
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't think of the other words.

396
00:38:26,835 --> 00:38:32,678
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, see the mats that go down on the curb cuts.

397
00:38:32,839 --> 00:38:34,460
[SPEAKER_03]: The inclines.

398
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:34,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

399
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:35,921
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

400
00:38:36,061 --> 00:38:37,982
[SPEAKER_00]: There's supposed to be specific colors.

401
00:38:38,002 --> 00:38:38,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Gradients.

402
00:38:38,642 --> 00:38:39,723
[SPEAKER_00]: Gradients.

403
00:38:39,883 --> 00:38:40,123
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

404
00:38:40,323 --> 00:38:45,467
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the reasons why I know everybody wants, people want the rainbow crosswalk.

405
00:38:46,391 --> 00:38:51,093
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would love to give people the rainbow crosswalk, but I can't give it to them where they want it.

406
00:38:51,534 --> 00:38:54,895
[SPEAKER_00]: They want it on high visibility, high traffic area.

407
00:38:55,436 --> 00:38:59,818
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, that's the worst area for the rainbow crosswalk.

408
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:06,982
[SPEAKER_00]: We're actually advised against that National Transportation Safety Board advises against because those cuts.

409
00:39:10,242 --> 00:39:13,005
[SPEAKER_00]: and not an alignment for people who are visually impaired.

410
00:39:13,405 --> 00:39:19,571
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we're going to do it, we should do it where there's not that much amount of traffic.

411
00:39:19,932 --> 00:39:23,295
[SPEAKER_00]: Because especially at night, when it rains, reflection, this, that.

412
00:39:23,756 --> 00:39:24,897
[SPEAKER_00]: I was reading the whole thing.

413
00:39:24,937 --> 00:39:25,998
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, oh my goodness.

414
00:39:29,381 --> 00:39:42,890
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, so there are two different things and I interchange and I will typically defer to the individual how they want to be addressed.

415
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:47,933
[SPEAKER_00]: I have people, some people tell me that they prefer the term handicap.

416
00:39:48,433 --> 00:39:51,675
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people tell me that they prefer having a disability.

417
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,944
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for answering all these questions.

418
00:39:57,087 --> 00:40:02,902
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully I didn't interrupt your agenda, but I was just very curious about the committee and what you do, what your goals are.

419
00:40:04,215 --> 00:40:05,236
[SPEAKER_00]: You're very welcome.

420
00:40:05,296 --> 00:40:17,924
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you didn't interrupt and I think that, you know, you're asking of the questions only helps members of the community who could be watching through other means better understand what it is that we do.

421
00:40:19,444 --> 00:40:20,925
[SPEAKER_00]: We are recruiting.

422
00:40:22,046 --> 00:40:24,468
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still severely short.

423
00:40:26,429 --> 00:40:43,797
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody that is here so far, including one of our other members who isn't here today, is very passionate and brings their own lens of what disability means to them and, you know, is here to be a support to the community.

424
00:40:45,978 --> 00:40:49,480
[SPEAKER_00]: My office of one, there's only so much we can do.

425
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,241
[SPEAKER_00]: At some point, we must sleep.

426
00:40:54,542 --> 00:41:05,826
[SPEAKER_00]: The good news is Nicholas will be continuing until 2026 when the last ARPA funds are being spent.

427
00:41:05,886 --> 00:41:09,348
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's because the contract has to be done now.

428
00:41:09,528 --> 00:41:11,568
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's great.

429
00:41:11,789 --> 00:41:18,771
[SPEAKER_00]: I will take the 15 hours a week extra over no hours a week extra.

430
00:41:18,791 --> 00:41:19,731
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean,

431
00:41:21,632 --> 00:41:28,437
[SPEAKER_00]: if I think about like it was August and September, the amount of off-site things that I would have had to do.

432
00:41:28,657 --> 00:41:30,779
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't know what I would have done.

433
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:38,304
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything from a walking tour of Tufts because they wanted to put something, you know,

434
00:41:39,365 --> 00:41:51,057
[SPEAKER_00]: to the, you know, the accessible playground, to like site visits because another business was opening and somebody was complaining about something.

435
00:41:51,077 --> 00:41:55,381
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, 15 hours a week are going to be huge.

436
00:41:55,421 --> 00:41:58,444
[SPEAKER_00]: To also doing the research, right?

437
00:41:58,945 --> 00:42:00,667
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is also huge, right?

438
00:42:02,610 --> 00:42:07,394
[SPEAKER_00]: getting information back to residents who reach out to the city.

439
00:42:07,414 --> 00:42:08,594
[SPEAKER_00]: It's huge.

440
00:42:09,495 --> 00:42:12,217
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will definitely take the 15 hours a week.

441
00:42:12,277 --> 00:42:15,519
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really happy about that.

442
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,661
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, thank you.

443
00:42:19,553 --> 00:42:20,413
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome.

444
00:42:20,433 --> 00:42:23,334
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, update on the date.

445
00:42:23,414 --> 00:42:36,578
[SPEAKER_00]: So I checked on the dates and basically summer schedule, spring to summer schedule right now is clear, but we were asked to stay away from Memorial Day weekend.

446
00:42:37,318 --> 00:42:45,182
[SPEAKER_00]: which I would agree with, because I think that that's the first weekend where people start looking, going away.

447
00:42:45,723 --> 00:43:01,191
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't know, did you, I know it was end of April to mid-May, we were looking for, how many of us, yeah, the disability fair, I think using the inclusive.

448
00:43:04,126 --> 00:43:15,113
[SPEAKER_00]: How many of us are confident that the weather will... I know, Sue, I know, I know.

449
00:43:15,133 --> 00:43:22,659
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not confident at all in the weather, just because of what's happening now.

450
00:43:22,679 --> 00:43:22,739
[SPEAKER_03]: But...

451
00:43:29,564 --> 00:43:36,109
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that late April, early May is good.

452
00:43:36,129 --> 00:43:38,670
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

453
00:43:40,371 --> 00:43:43,033
[SPEAKER_03]: I think late April is fine.

454
00:43:43,053 --> 00:43:48,337
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pulling up a calendar.

455
00:43:50,598 --> 00:43:54,300
[SPEAKER_03]: All except Passover and I can't remember what that is.

456
00:43:55,081 --> 00:43:56,482
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's

457
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:59,481
[SPEAKER_03]: April 14th or something.

458
00:44:02,882 --> 00:44:03,922
[SPEAKER_00]: For Passover?

459
00:44:03,942 --> 00:44:05,102
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

460
00:44:05,122 --> 00:44:12,024
[SPEAKER_00]: I just pulled up my time and date.

461
00:44:17,305 --> 00:44:19,306
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me Google when it's Passover.

462
00:44:20,151 --> 00:44:23,172
[SPEAKER_03]: I know we did this last time and I just can't remember.

463
00:44:25,593 --> 00:44:28,454
[SPEAKER_00]: If you could remember, Sue, I would be very afraid.

464
00:44:30,414 --> 00:44:40,418
[SPEAKER_00]: Passover is on the evening of Saturday, April 12th, and then it runs into Sunday, April 20th.

465
00:44:42,899 --> 00:44:58,475
[SPEAKER_03]: um only the first like two or three days of Passover are the important bits okay so we do have the weekend of

466
00:45:12,979 --> 00:45:18,281
[SPEAKER_00]: So Passover, the important days would be like 12, 13, 14 soon, right?

467
00:45:18,361 --> 00:45:18,801
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

468
00:45:20,141 --> 00:45:24,603
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do have the weekend of the 19th and the 20th.

469
00:45:25,383 --> 00:45:28,484
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just wondering though, is there not a holiday?

470
00:45:28,504 --> 00:45:32,505
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there an April holiday, Patriot's Day?

471
00:45:32,525 --> 00:45:36,546
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Patriot's Day is usually the 17th.

472
00:45:36,566 --> 00:45:36,706
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

473
00:45:36,726 --> 00:45:36,766
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

474
00:45:45,512 --> 00:45:46,632
[SPEAKER_00]: just to make sure.

475
00:45:47,713 --> 00:45:51,735
[SPEAKER_03]: It's sometimes celebrated on the Monday afterwards.

476
00:45:51,755 --> 00:45:53,436
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

477
00:45:55,497 --> 00:45:58,478
[SPEAKER_00]: Patriots Day 2025.

478
00:45:59,819 --> 00:46:04,121
[SPEAKER_00]: So Patriots Day is on this day, the 21st.

479
00:46:04,682 --> 00:46:05,182
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

480
00:46:06,082 --> 00:46:07,723
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my day too.

481
00:46:10,205 --> 00:46:12,666
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that when they do a, um,

482
00:46:15,033 --> 00:46:16,815
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that when they ride through the square?

483
00:46:17,595 --> 00:46:17,855
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

484
00:46:19,177 --> 00:46:19,497
Okay.

485
00:46:21,939 --> 00:46:25,402
[SPEAKER_01]: Not to cut in, are we talking outdoors, indoors, or 50-50?

486
00:46:25,922 --> 00:46:30,386
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought we were talking 50-50 the last time.

487
00:46:31,047 --> 00:46:32,828
[SPEAKER_00]: What did you think, Sue?

488
00:46:33,989 --> 00:46:36,511
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we were talking 50-50.

489
00:46:37,112 --> 00:46:43,017
[SPEAKER_03]: I think maybe we should schedule it for the weekend after.

490
00:46:43,945 --> 00:46:44,745
[SPEAKER_00]: The 26th?

491
00:46:45,145 --> 00:46:45,525
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

492
00:46:45,546 --> 00:46:46,306
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

493
00:46:49,267 --> 00:46:50,547
[SPEAKER_00]: Joe, you're good for that date?

494
00:46:51,827 --> 00:46:52,567
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm good.

495
00:46:53,208 --> 00:46:53,588
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

496
00:46:57,089 --> 00:47:00,230
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe do the 26th and then do a rain date for the 27th?

497
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:00,850
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

498
00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:02,730
[SPEAKER_05]: Great idea.

499
00:47:03,210 --> 00:47:04,111
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, all right.

500
00:47:04,871 --> 00:47:12,213
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I was thinking... Yeah, because the 20th is Easter Sunday.

501
00:47:13,657 --> 00:47:14,297
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it is?

502
00:47:15,858 --> 00:47:16,499
[SPEAKER_00]: So Easter Sunday.

503
00:47:16,519 --> 00:47:18,160
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it's on the bottom of the calendar.

504
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:19,441
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.

505
00:47:25,604 --> 00:47:25,945
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

506
00:47:26,205 --> 00:47:30,968
[SPEAKER_00]: I will put a hold on our behalf for both of those dates.

507
00:47:31,728 --> 00:47:39,473
[SPEAKER_00]: And as far as time, are you thinking you want to do like an 11 to 2?

508
00:47:39,793 --> 00:47:42,115
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you want to do like a 1 to 4?

509
00:47:45,483 --> 00:47:46,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I like the 11 to 2.

510
00:47:47,804 --> 00:47:48,264
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

511
00:47:48,284 --> 00:47:50,204
[SPEAKER_00]: 11 to 2, good.

512
00:47:50,644 --> 00:47:51,104
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

513
00:47:51,684 --> 00:47:57,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it gets, it avoids that nap time for our kids.

514
00:47:58,086 --> 00:47:58,346
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

515
00:47:59,186 --> 00:47:59,366
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

516
00:47:59,546 --> 00:48:02,507
[SPEAKER_04]: Never mind the kids.

517
00:48:02,527 --> 00:48:03,147
[SPEAKER_00]: For adults.

518
00:48:03,167 --> 00:48:03,847
[SPEAKER_00]: We all like naps.

519
00:48:04,447 --> 00:48:05,087
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah.

520
00:48:06,828 --> 00:48:08,568
[SPEAKER_00]: For adults too, okay.

521
00:48:09,731 --> 00:48:10,191
[SPEAKER_00]: I will.

522
00:48:10,571 --> 00:48:12,452
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm at the high school tomorrow.

523
00:48:12,472 --> 00:48:22,277
[SPEAKER_00]: I will talk with Dr. Cushing because I want to see if I can do a quick tour.

524
00:48:23,018 --> 00:48:28,740
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in my mind, I can see it, but I might be mixing up my schools as per usual.

525
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:31,342
[SPEAKER_00]: But I sort of want to make sure that

526
00:48:32,882 --> 00:48:51,070
[SPEAKER_00]: the school I'm thinking of has different areas where we could have like a sensory area for those who might want to come, but may not necessarily want to be a part of the big everything that's going on, but still want to participate.

527
00:48:52,350 --> 00:48:55,732
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and we could have a quiet area.

528
00:48:56,456 --> 00:49:05,635
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's what I was thinking, like a quiet era with different types of sensory activities taking place in that area.

529
00:49:09,336 --> 00:49:15,118
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so I'll report back to you by email to just let you know that it's all booked and we're good to go.

530
00:49:15,138 --> 00:49:17,978
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I think we have plenty of time.

531
00:49:18,939 --> 00:49:23,040
[SPEAKER_00]: You can start emailing me your ideas if you want me to bring vendors.

532
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:29,382
[SPEAKER_00]: I have that master list of all the vendors that came the last time.

533
00:49:29,982 --> 00:49:33,003
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the weather will be nice enough and we can get some baby goats.

534
00:49:35,348 --> 00:49:36,549
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good thing.

535
00:49:39,392 --> 00:49:48,560
[SPEAKER_03]: I can try to get the MBTA accessibility people.

536
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:51,142
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be the ATA group?

537
00:49:51,642 --> 00:49:52,002
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

538
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:53,901
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be fabs.

539
00:49:54,261 --> 00:49:56,944
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially their community engagement group.

540
00:49:57,444 --> 00:50:03,149
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you guys have noticed, but the MBTA community engagement group has been everywhere.

541
00:50:05,191 --> 00:50:07,793
[SPEAKER_00]: They're literally going out to communities.

542
00:50:08,574 --> 00:50:18,943
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it would be fantastic for them to come out so that people can hear about the different options that there are.

543
00:50:20,598 --> 00:50:23,499
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, is it the red line or the orange line?

544
00:50:24,039 --> 00:50:31,482
[SPEAKER_00]: Last week or the week before, celebrated the first time it ran without a slow zone.

545
00:50:32,403 --> 00:50:41,907
[SPEAKER_03]: Something about the first... Yeah, the orange line, I think, because the red line and the green line are under repairs.

546
00:50:42,487 --> 00:50:42,647
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

547
00:50:43,655 --> 00:50:47,739
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do think that it would be good for the community engagement folks to come out.

548
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:55,947
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've also noticed a different style of signage, not in Medford.

549
00:50:56,367 --> 00:50:58,770
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did just wanna throw that out there.

550
00:50:58,870 --> 00:51:03,194
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if the MBTA is changing its signage.

551
00:51:04,155 --> 00:51:07,178
[SPEAKER_00]: I noticed at Beachmont on my way home,

552
00:51:08,891 --> 00:51:21,580
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why, for some reason, it just caught my eye that the sign was a little lower than it typically is, but a lot bolder and a lot cleaner.

553
00:51:22,701 --> 00:51:23,982
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you could actually read it.

554
00:51:24,602 --> 00:51:25,583
[SPEAKER_03]: They're changing.

555
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:29,025
[SPEAKER_03]: They've changed and working on their wayfinding.

556
00:51:29,686 --> 00:51:30,066
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.

557
00:51:30,786 --> 00:51:31,487
[SPEAKER_00]: That's huge.

558
00:51:32,608 --> 00:51:32,948
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

559
00:51:33,068 --> 00:51:36,410
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I don't know how anybody could read these things in tiny little fonts.

560
00:51:36,911 --> 00:51:37,251
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

561
00:51:38,774 --> 00:51:42,177
[SPEAKER_00]: And their buses seem to start to have a sense of humor now.

562
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:46,702
[SPEAKER_00]: They have like funny little messages.

563
00:51:50,405 --> 00:51:50,725
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

564
00:51:51,106 --> 00:51:56,771
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, so I think that that would be wonderful to have them come around.

565
00:51:59,550 --> 00:52:18,503
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will share the master list of names of the vendors from before, and then I'll share that via email, and then each person can just email me back individually if there are some that you're like, OK, I really want you to ask this person to come back.

566
00:52:19,303 --> 00:52:19,483
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

567
00:52:22,245 --> 00:52:35,928
[SPEAKER_03]: I will work on the MBTA people as soon as you get the days set because they go fast.

568
00:52:36,769 --> 00:52:38,109
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I will.

569
00:52:38,609 --> 00:52:44,231
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll definitely talk to Dr. Cushion tomorrow because we'll all be in the same place.

570
00:52:45,111 --> 00:52:45,431
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

571
00:52:46,391 --> 00:52:46,751
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

572
00:52:46,951 --> 00:52:47,191
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.

573
00:52:50,727 --> 00:52:53,108
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just moving to new business, Joe.

574
00:52:53,528 --> 00:52:55,589
[SPEAKER_00]: Joe, you had asked a couple of questions.

575
00:52:55,649 --> 00:53:01,411
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the biggest disability related complaints that the office receives?

576
00:53:02,331 --> 00:53:03,972
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really accessibility.

577
00:53:05,592 --> 00:53:15,256
[SPEAKER_00]: Neighbors that aren't being too kind, so they let their trees grow over into the roadway.

578
00:53:16,883 --> 00:53:29,445
[SPEAKER_00]: And sidewalk accessibility in terms of people thinking that it's okay to take that one accessible spot because you're running to the store for five minutes.

579
00:53:32,381 --> 00:53:43,269
[SPEAKER_00]: The curb cuts are a big one, but in a way, the curb cuts are easier to address because the city has a plan.

580
00:53:43,289 --> 00:53:50,614
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't do them all at the same time, but there's a giant list.

581
00:53:50,854 --> 00:53:59,481
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do think that the one that hurts the most is the accessible parking and the utilization of the accessible parking.

582
00:54:01,182 --> 00:54:12,488
[SPEAKER_00]: You have people that will, if we have two accessible parking spots and we have the gradient in the middle, people will actually park in the middle.

583
00:54:12,728 --> 00:54:22,314
[SPEAKER_00]: If a van pulls in, the van can't drop the lift because there's a car.

584
00:54:22,354 --> 00:54:30,398
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the biggest issues, I would say, that the office receives.

585
00:54:34,834 --> 00:54:38,577
[SPEAKER_00]: Once in a while, I might get something about a business.

586
00:54:39,438 --> 00:54:41,980
[SPEAKER_00]: I will typically reach out to the business.

587
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:48,365
[SPEAKER_00]: I will encourage the person to complete a civil rights violation form.

588
00:54:48,846 --> 00:54:54,591
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you don't complete a form, there's really nothing that gives me the authority to go to a business.

589
00:54:54,671 --> 00:54:56,312
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't there, I didn't see it.

590
00:54:56,332 --> 00:54:57,973
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no police report rate.

591
00:54:58,534 --> 00:55:01,917
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you complete a form, I can say, hey, I'm giving a call.

592
00:55:02,457 --> 00:55:05,359
[SPEAKER_00]: because you're a business in our community.

593
00:55:05,399 --> 00:55:09,481
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you know, we value all people within our community.

594
00:55:09,982 --> 00:55:11,723
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm told that this occurred.

595
00:55:11,863 --> 00:55:16,385
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you like some support so that this doesn't happen in the future?

596
00:55:17,026 --> 00:55:21,949
[SPEAKER_00]: And most times people are open and are, oh my goodness, I'm so sorry.

597
00:55:22,389 --> 00:55:24,990
[SPEAKER_00]: I will have to look and see who was on shift that day.

598
00:55:25,451 --> 00:55:27,092
[SPEAKER_00]: Or yes, we do have training.

599
00:55:27,752 --> 00:55:28,833
[SPEAKER_00]: Every once in a while,

600
00:55:29,593 --> 00:55:33,576
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be somebody who will give you the go mind your business attitude.

601
00:55:34,376 --> 00:55:40,380
[SPEAKER_00]: And depending on what it is, reaching out is usually enough.

602
00:55:41,581 --> 00:55:48,886
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're really, really adamant, then I have cause for concern because they're a business in Medford.

603
00:55:49,406 --> 00:55:54,970
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want people to feel that they're not welcome in the city.

604
00:55:56,059 --> 00:56:02,541
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll usually go up the ladder and reach out to their corporate office.

605
00:56:04,202 --> 00:56:06,002
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's few and far between.

606
00:56:06,462 --> 00:56:10,484
[SPEAKER_00]: That's only happened about three times since I've been here.

607
00:56:14,365 --> 00:56:16,906
[SPEAKER_00]: I will, I'm sorry, go ahead Sue.

608
00:56:16,926 --> 00:56:20,047
[SPEAKER_03]: What kind of complaints have you gotten about businesses?

609
00:56:21,237 --> 00:56:39,175
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was a woman who used to live in Medford, relocated to another town, but likes to come back to Medford to do a shop at a particular location because it's near an appointment that she has.

610
00:56:40,516 --> 00:56:41,777
[SPEAKER_00]: went to that location.

611
00:56:41,817 --> 00:56:43,378
[SPEAKER_00]: She says she's always done it.

612
00:56:43,938 --> 00:56:49,080
[SPEAKER_00]: She, um, it's difficult to use the carriage and the motorized scooter as well.

613
00:56:49,601 --> 00:56:56,424
[SPEAKER_00]: So she uses the carriage for balance, takes her time, enjoys her way around the store.

614
00:56:57,064 --> 00:57:02,427
[SPEAKER_00]: Afterwards, she'll usually put her things in, then she will

615
00:57:03,887 --> 00:57:15,552
[SPEAKER_00]: take her bags out in the carriage, use the carriage to balance, put her bags in, get out her scooter and use her scooter to push the carriage back.

616
00:57:16,092 --> 00:57:17,473
[SPEAKER_00]: She's done it all the time.

617
00:57:18,293 --> 00:57:30,498
[SPEAKER_00]: There was an incident that this woman reports that unfortunately, it didn't just stop as don't take the carriage out, the person physically pulls the carriage

618
00:57:32,145 --> 00:57:32,865
[SPEAKER_00]: from her.

619
00:57:33,286 --> 00:57:37,367
[SPEAKER_00]: Now remember, not every disability is visible.

620
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:46,391
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a result of pulling a tool, right, that the person uses to balance.

621
00:57:49,972 --> 00:57:53,894
[SPEAKER_00]: So like that required some, yeah.

622
00:57:55,775 --> 00:57:55,875
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh.

623
00:57:56,972 --> 00:58:04,297
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it is not the store that did this, but it is a person that works for the store, right?

624
00:58:04,317 --> 00:58:08,320
[SPEAKER_00]: So therefore the store has to be made aware.

625
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:16,966
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't comfortable for me to make this call because it's like, I hope this is accurate, right?

626
00:58:18,527 --> 00:58:21,589
[SPEAKER_00]: But the woman gave me a good enough description.

627
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:30,116
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I called the store, they said that they knew exactly who the person was.

628
00:58:31,377 --> 00:58:33,858
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just said, you know, it's just concerning to me.

629
00:58:33,919 --> 00:58:41,404
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, you know, I have to do a lot of training for folks to understand that, you know, you can't just take things at face value.

630
00:58:41,444 --> 00:58:46,708
[SPEAKER_00]: There's typically a lot more going on with a person than what you see visually.

631
00:58:47,689 --> 00:59:00,977
[SPEAKER_00]: And even if your policies may be that you don't take your carriages to the car, sometimes when people are taking that carriage, you should ask yourself, does this person need this?

632
00:59:01,417 --> 00:59:05,639
[SPEAKER_00]: I said a different way would have been just saying, hey, do you need some assistance?

633
00:59:05,719 --> 00:59:08,701
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we can't take the carriages out.

634
00:59:09,181 --> 00:59:16,966
[SPEAKER_00]: But to physically remove the carriage, I don't really understand what should have been no physical contact.

635
00:59:18,337 --> 00:59:22,860
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I was assured that, um, it would be handled.

636
00:59:23,461 --> 00:59:31,866
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the impression that the person may not have been an employee that they were willing to go to bat or keep.

637
00:59:33,007 --> 00:59:33,207
[SPEAKER_00]: Um.

638
00:59:34,288 --> 00:59:36,970
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so, but that was.

639
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:44,034
[SPEAKER_00]: That was that was really difficult to hear.

640
00:59:44,595 --> 00:59:47,817
[SPEAKER_00]: That was really, really difficult to hear.

641
00:59:50,899 --> 00:59:52,100
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

642
00:59:52,660 --> 00:59:52,860
Yeah.

643
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:59,363
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, don't, you know, it's not our, that's not how we behave in Medford, right?

644
00:59:59,723 --> 01:00:01,824
[SPEAKER_00]: But all it does, it takes just one person.

645
01:00:02,264 --> 01:00:02,444
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

646
01:00:03,325 --> 01:00:03,585
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

647
01:00:03,685 --> 01:00:10,488
[SPEAKER_00]: Person who had lived here for so long, downsized, you know, but still comes back here.

648
01:00:10,648 --> 01:00:10,908
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

649
01:00:10,968 --> 01:00:16,731
[SPEAKER_00]: So that one was, that was not a good one for me to deal with.

650
01:00:16,771 --> 01:00:16,991
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

651
01:00:17,011 --> 01:00:19,332
[SPEAKER_00]: That was really problematic and difficult.

652
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:20,660
[SPEAKER_00]: me.

653
01:00:20,821 --> 01:00:27,929
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know I had to swallow my own anger and frustration and try to have like a civil conversation.

654
01:00:27,969 --> 01:00:34,496
[SPEAKER_00]: But fortunately on the receipt on the other hand they were willing to hear.

655
01:00:35,037 --> 01:00:35,818
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.

656
01:00:37,682 --> 01:00:38,682
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the one.

657
01:00:39,083 --> 01:00:46,265
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the other ones that I've had about business aren't really disability related.

658
01:00:47,926 --> 01:00:59,010
[SPEAKER_00]: They fall more in terms of the diversity angle, feeling like they're being treated differently based on their national origin.

659
01:00:59,090 --> 01:01:05,292
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's funny because the two that I have received complaints about are not

660
01:01:06,032 --> 01:01:10,822
[SPEAKER_00]: Associated with people who are residents and it's the people who come to do.

661
01:01:12,245 --> 01:01:13,988
[SPEAKER_00]: Business that has.

662
01:01:15,260 --> 01:01:19,063
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay these complaints and then another 1 had to do with housing.

663
01:01:19,564 --> 01:01:27,431
[SPEAKER_00]: So, anything, you know, there are John, there are different parameters to anything that has to do with housing, especially if it's public housing.

664
01:01:27,991 --> 01:01:31,034
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to make sure that person knows how to get in contact with.

665
01:01:31,794 --> 01:01:34,076
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a very strict process.

666
01:01:34,557 --> 01:01:37,820
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you don't, you don't discriminate against people because.

667
01:01:38,841 --> 01:01:41,203
[SPEAKER_00]: They have housing subsidies that that is.

668
01:01:42,648 --> 01:01:47,871
[SPEAKER_00]: violation of the law and it's hard when people are using realtors.

669
01:01:48,491 --> 01:02:01,859
[SPEAKER_00]: I've received more calls, more inquiry calls from realtors looking for support and assistance around service animals and emotional support dogs.

670
01:02:03,263 --> 01:02:03,644
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.

671
01:02:04,324 --> 01:02:15,160
[SPEAKER_00]: And at my last quarterly tee with the M.O.D., there's going to be new guidance or clearer guidance around that, you know.

672
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:18,504
[SPEAKER_00]: But the rule of thumb is still to ask, you know, oh,

673
01:02:20,505 --> 01:02:24,527
[SPEAKER_00]: What tasks is your animal trained to perform?

674
01:02:25,368 --> 01:02:33,693
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how you can determine if it's a service and an animal, because there are tasks that we may not be able to see.

675
01:02:34,941 --> 01:02:42,844
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, dogs, service animals, smell changes in body chemistry.

676
01:02:43,325 --> 01:02:52,969
[SPEAKER_00]: I was with a trainer who talks about the cheese tacks, and there was a woman who had a dog who accidentally trained her dog to be her service animal.

677
01:02:53,069 --> 01:03:00,032
[SPEAKER_00]: Did not intend on training the dog, but every time her blood sugar dropped to something, she would go to the fridge.

678
01:03:00,832 --> 01:03:07,155
[SPEAKER_00]: and eat a piece of cheese, like one of those little thingies of cheese.

679
01:03:08,036 --> 01:03:16,480
[SPEAKER_00]: And one day, the dog went to the fridge and brought her a thing of cheese.

680
01:03:18,181 --> 01:03:20,922
[SPEAKER_00]: And she was like, oh, I'm OK.

681
01:03:20,982 --> 01:03:22,143
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, she didn't feel great.

682
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:25,725
[SPEAKER_00]: And when she checked, sure enough, her blood sugar was going down.

683
01:03:26,801 --> 01:03:29,563
[SPEAKER_00]: Through observation, the dog learns this.

684
01:03:29,583 --> 01:03:30,724
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very cool.

685
01:03:31,284 --> 01:03:39,751
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, what service animals are able to do in this day and age, it's absolutely amazing.

686
01:03:40,031 --> 01:03:47,517
[SPEAKER_00]: Yesterday, I had gone somewhere and I was driving, and there was a man with his service animal that was crossing in front of me.

687
01:03:47,977 --> 01:03:52,761
[SPEAKER_00]: But the service animal was independent, and the man was walking behind him.

688
01:03:53,361 --> 01:03:55,886
[SPEAKER_00]: independently, not immediately behind.

689
01:03:56,346 --> 01:03:57,428
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no leash.

690
01:03:57,909 --> 01:03:59,692
[SPEAKER_00]: And they crossed in front of me.

691
01:04:00,153 --> 01:04:04,901
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, I think he either said halt or he gave a command.

692
01:04:06,173 --> 01:04:14,196
[SPEAKER_00]: and he put his hand up, even though the dog was going, looking forward, the dog turned to the left and literally stopped.

693
01:04:14,816 --> 01:04:17,578
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, this is great, what's gonna happen?

694
01:04:17,598 --> 01:04:22,279
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't see anymore because of course the light turned green and I had to move to tonight.

695
01:04:22,980 --> 01:04:26,941
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was just curious because that's not one that I had seen before, right?

696
01:04:27,381 --> 01:04:30,703
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm used to seeing service animals with their, you know,

697
01:04:31,543 --> 01:04:36,987
[SPEAKER_00]: with the person that they're caring for right next to them in like a workspace and stuff.

698
01:04:37,447 --> 01:04:43,591
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was really cool to see that and the service animal had on their working vest.

699
01:04:44,731 --> 01:04:52,837
[SPEAKER_00]: And I learned that with some service animals, you can now pet them when they have their working vest on.

700
01:04:53,397 --> 01:04:59,401
[SPEAKER_00]: It will actually say on the vest, yes, it is okay to pet me.

701
01:05:00,967 --> 01:05:09,635
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was always from the old school where you don't touch the service animal and you don't pay attention to the service animal because you don't want to distract them.

702
01:05:10,136 --> 01:05:10,957
[SPEAKER_00]: But I learned that.

703
01:05:11,497 --> 01:05:17,543
[SPEAKER_00]: And then last week there's a service animal that goes into the classrooms at the high school, Kelsey.

704
01:05:23,279 --> 01:05:24,240
[SPEAKER_00]: You can now pet them.

705
01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:26,381
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything is changing.

706
01:05:27,101 --> 01:05:31,082
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I feel like you have to be a curious creature.

707
01:05:31,122 --> 01:05:40,426
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be willing to invest in your own learning in order to be supportive of people with disabilities.

708
01:05:41,727 --> 01:05:43,187
[SPEAKER_00]: You say you're going to be an advocate.

709
01:05:43,227 --> 01:05:50,890
[SPEAKER_00]: You just can't be an advocate from what you last read or, you know, the last training that you went to 25 years ago.

710
01:05:59,498 --> 01:06:07,221
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Joe, I will make sure that there's a reminder on the city website about clearing the snow and ice from the walkways.

711
01:06:08,601 --> 01:06:13,003
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I'll see if maybe Steve or Emma's team can do it as a pop-up.

712
01:06:17,124 --> 01:06:19,645
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody have any other questions?

713
01:06:23,586 --> 01:06:25,527
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody have anything else to add?

714
01:06:30,418 --> 01:06:33,319
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to cut in just real quick quick.

715
01:06:34,259 --> 01:06:37,640
[SPEAKER_02]: During Halloween, they had a big thing down Method Square.

716
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:44,341
[SPEAKER_02]: And I noticed some of the departments from City Hall had tables out giving candy to kids.

717
01:06:44,441 --> 01:06:45,201
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was great.

718
01:06:45,762 --> 01:06:51,283
[SPEAKER_02]: So the mayor there saw the fire department and some maybe Chamber of Commerce and something else.

719
01:06:52,139 --> 01:07:00,481
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll volunteer next year if you want to put a table out there and give candy out from the Department of Disabilities.

720
01:07:00,621 --> 01:07:15,625
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was another thing that we were talking about is, I'll look into it more, but years ago, maybe about five years ago, they sent the census out.

721
01:07:16,554 --> 01:07:33,907
[SPEAKER_02]: to the residents of City tied in with 911, that if there was somebody at that particular residence that had a disability or maybe heart problems or anything like that, that if there was ever an emergency at that address,

722
01:07:35,568 --> 01:07:41,793
[SPEAKER_02]: the 911 center has an idea of what they might be responding to.

723
01:07:42,094 --> 01:07:51,262
[SPEAKER_02]: So like if there was a fire and somebody was in a wheelchair, they know there's a good chance that person is still in the property.

724
01:07:52,002 --> 01:07:59,369
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to look into that because of, um, I think I put my son on that listing and, um,

725
01:08:01,038 --> 01:08:06,479
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of gives them an idea why they're coming to the emergency, what they might be up against.

726
01:08:07,980 --> 01:08:12,221
[SPEAKER_00]: Joe, I believe it's one of two things that you're talking about.

727
01:08:12,721 --> 01:08:16,082
[SPEAKER_00]: There is one called SMART 911.

728
01:08:16,802 --> 01:08:21,843
[SPEAKER_00]: That one you have to update it every six months, right?

729
01:08:22,343 --> 01:08:23,784
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's another one.

730
01:08:24,224 --> 01:08:25,704
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little red packet.

731
01:08:25,804 --> 01:08:28,385
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanna say that it's called Facts for Life.

732
01:08:29,005 --> 01:08:31,267
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to ask Captain Clemente.

733
01:08:31,787 --> 01:08:37,972
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the one that stays somewhere visible, whether it's your refrigerator or whatever.

734
01:08:38,492 --> 01:08:41,114
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like a little red plastic envelope.

735
01:08:41,514 --> 01:08:46,138
[SPEAKER_00]: You list like your medications on there, your emergency contact.

736
01:08:46,658 --> 01:08:53,403
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, Smart 911, I was trying to see if I could get my hands on the hard copy.

737
01:08:53,864 --> 01:08:57,847
[SPEAKER_00]: I had emailed out probably a year and a half ago.

738
01:08:58,827 --> 01:09:05,649
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that might be what you're talking about, and it's connected to the 911 center.

739
01:09:06,229 --> 01:09:11,350
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is something that must be updated every six months.

740
01:09:11,991 --> 01:09:22,853
[SPEAKER_00]: But perhaps between you and I, we could look at it or maybe invite Captain Clemente to talk about it at our next meeting, if you'd like.

741
01:09:22,873 --> 01:09:24,794
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be a great idea.

742
01:09:29,135 --> 01:09:33,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there's a lot of people that move in and out of the city or new residents, you know, things like that.

743
01:09:35,038 --> 01:09:40,221
[SPEAKER_02]: I know they're doing their job fantastic, but I think we just got to educate the public, that's all.

744
01:09:42,282 --> 01:09:44,243
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely, definitely.

745
01:09:47,404 --> 01:09:50,306
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, John, I think you were going to say something.

746
01:09:50,326 --> 01:09:52,827
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to say thank you for inviting me and I appreciate this.

747
01:09:53,742 --> 01:10:02,511
[SPEAKER_00]: You are very welcome and in case I didn't do it already, I will share the link to the ordinance with you.

748
01:10:02,531 --> 01:10:02,611
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

749
01:10:03,152 --> 01:10:06,415
[SPEAKER_00]: So that that way you have them.

750
01:10:08,537 --> 01:10:12,822
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't know if anybody has anything else to share.

751
01:10:15,942 --> 01:10:25,546
[SPEAKER_00]: As we are all on here and we have different celebrations, I want to wish you all compliments of the season.

752
01:10:25,566 --> 01:10:32,889
[SPEAKER_00]: May good fortune find you and stay with you throughout the new year.

753
01:10:33,689 --> 01:10:37,311
[SPEAKER_00]: Enjoy time with your friends, your family, your loved ones.

754
01:10:38,171 --> 01:10:41,492
[SPEAKER_00]: And wow, I can't believe I'm saying see you in 2025.

755
01:10:44,069 --> 01:10:44,570
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.

756
01:10:44,910 --> 01:10:45,331
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

757
01:10:45,692 --> 01:10:46,173
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.

758
01:10:46,233 --> 01:10:49,239
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell me when does December go up?

759
01:10:51,143 --> 01:10:53,567
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so it's almost that time.

760
01:10:54,269 --> 01:10:59,118
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll reconvene our next meeting January 22nd, 2025.

761
01:11:03,447 --> 01:11:05,350
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, everybody, you take care.

762
01:11:05,391 --> 01:11:07,495
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a wonderful rest of your evening.

763
01:11:07,615 --> 01:11:08,256
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice meeting you.

764
01:11:08,296 --> 01:11:08,537
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you.
