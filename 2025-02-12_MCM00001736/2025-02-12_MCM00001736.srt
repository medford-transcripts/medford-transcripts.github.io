[SPEAKER_03]: We have Fiona.

12
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:09,860
[SPEAKER_03]: Erin Lopate.

13
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,400
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, Jenny.

14
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:12,141
[SPEAKER_02]: I am here.

15
00:01:12,321 --> 00:01:12,741
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

16
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:14,941
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Fiona.

17
00:01:16,382 --> 00:01:17,082
[SPEAKER_02]: Peter Cushing.

18
00:01:17,642 --> 00:01:18,002
[SPEAKER_02]: Present.

19
00:01:18,743 --> 00:01:19,643
[SPEAKER_02]: John McLaughlin.

20
00:01:23,528 --> 00:01:28,475
[SPEAKER_02]: So, John is here and Bob Dixon, Bob Dickinson.

21
00:01:30,898 --> 00:01:36,365
[SPEAKER_02]: See Bob as well, so 3 voting members present 0 absent.

22
00:01:36,946 --> 00:01:37,647
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a quorum.

23
00:01:40,205 --> 00:01:44,107
[SPEAKER_02]: So, what I was hoping to do tonight was a couple of things.

24
00:01:44,347 --> 00:01:50,450
[SPEAKER_02]: So 1st, provide some updates and talk a little bit about this next phase of the project for for and then actually.

25
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:51,431
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at.

26
00:01:56,053 --> 00:01:59,536
[SPEAKER_02]: um, a drafted deliverable that we'll need to complete for the MSBA.

27
00:01:59,576 --> 00:02:01,057
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll talk about that in just a second.

28
00:02:01,658 --> 00:02:08,343
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, um, you know, implicit in all of that will be to discuss, like, our vetting and selection process.

29
00:02:08,543 --> 00:02:22,134
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, hope- my hope for tonight is that we can come out of it with, uh, an RFS that is pretty well complete, um, and ready to be vetted and viewed by MSBA, which is one of the steps in the process.

30
00:02:23,815 --> 00:02:28,597
[SPEAKER_02]: But between now and then, we have a couple of things to look at in the RFS.

31
00:02:28,657 --> 00:02:30,278
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll get to that in just a minute.

32
00:02:31,938 --> 00:02:38,881
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of sort of what happens in this next module, there's two big components of module 2.

33
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:42,983
[SPEAKER_02]: One is to hire the OPM, and the other is to hire the designer.

34
00:02:43,043 --> 00:02:47,665
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're not going to worry about the designer just yet, because we have to hire an OPM before that can happen.

35
00:02:49,570 --> 00:03:05,921
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe that we will be recommended for approval at the board meeting coming up on the 26th of February and that will be our invitation to the next phase of the project.

36
00:03:05,961 --> 00:03:10,504
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is module 2 of MSBA, which is where we hire our team.

37
00:03:10,624 --> 00:03:12,886
[SPEAKER_02]: That's actually going to help do the lion's share of the work.

38
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:13,046
[SPEAKER_02]: So.

39
00:03:13,822 --> 00:03:26,586
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm excited for the next phase because I think our work gets easier when we have the professionals on board who do this for a living instead of all of us having to figure out and learn all the moving parts of the MSBA process.

40
00:03:26,626 --> 00:03:34,028
[SPEAKER_02]: So once that happens, we will have to do a number of things.

41
00:03:34,108 --> 00:03:40,870
[SPEAKER_02]: So we will have to identify an OPM selection committee, which we actually have already done.

42
00:03:41,071 --> 00:03:41,871
[SPEAKER_02]: It is this group.

43
00:03:43,031 --> 00:03:45,893
[SPEAKER_02]: We identified and voted on this back in September.

44
00:03:48,075 --> 00:04:04,826
[SPEAKER_02]: As I think about the work ahead, and we can maybe come back to this at the end, but as of right now, we have three voting members on this committee, myself, Aaron, and Dr. Cushing, and we will make the selection of the OPM.

45
00:04:05,146 --> 00:04:08,409
[SPEAKER_02]: That's actually, in my mind, quite a small group of people.

46
00:04:09,669 --> 00:04:13,471
[SPEAKER_02]: To pick what becomes a really central figure in our process.

47
00:04:13,511 --> 00:04:18,274
[SPEAKER_02]: So we may want to think about at our next full committee meeting.

48
00:04:18,294 --> 00:04:23,217
[SPEAKER_02]: Adding some number of voting members to this committee members.

49
00:04:23,257 --> 00:04:24,338
[SPEAKER_02]: So, thank you for joining.

50
00:04:24,358 --> 00:04:28,260
[SPEAKER_02]: And certainly, you know.

51
00:04:29,646 --> 00:04:31,507
[SPEAKER_02]: The more the merrier is probably not the right.

52
00:04:32,027 --> 00:04:37,690
[SPEAKER_02]: Thought process to make this happen, but I do think we should welcome.

53
00:04:39,711 --> 00:04:45,654
[SPEAKER_02]: Some perspectives outside of school administration and elected officials to the process.

54
00:04:45,694 --> 00:04:47,875
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have to think about that.

55
00:04:48,475 --> 00:04:49,996
[SPEAKER_02]: We can come back to that at the end.

56
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:53,178
[SPEAKER_02]: Once we have once I can give you a little bit more information about.

57
00:04:54,217 --> 00:04:59,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, what this process is and what the and more and I think as importantly, what the timeline is.

58
00:04:59,362 --> 00:05:11,092
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, once we get sort of flagged through to this next phase, we will have to do a couple of things to be able to have to designate our procurement admin.

59
00:05:11,973 --> 00:05:12,674
[SPEAKER_02]: That's Fiona.

60
00:05:12,714 --> 00:05:13,755
[SPEAKER_02]: So we know who that is.

61
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:17,058
[SPEAKER_02]: We just have to officially put that in writing and move along.

62
00:05:18,271 --> 00:05:24,625
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to let them know who our selection committee is, which we will be able to do pretty quickly.

63
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:37,694
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we will have to give them a draft of what they call RFS, request for services, that shows our redlined version of their template.

64
00:05:37,814 --> 00:05:41,035
[SPEAKER_02]: So MSBA does require that we use their template.

65
00:05:41,055 --> 00:05:42,095
[SPEAKER_02]: It's quite prescriptive.

66
00:05:43,455 --> 00:05:46,576
[SPEAKER_02]: It made it actually quite easy to fill out, which was wonderful.

67
00:05:48,216 --> 00:05:52,197
[SPEAKER_02]: I was working on this with Will from our communications team.

68
00:05:52,217 --> 00:05:55,058
[SPEAKER_02]: So we will have to

69
00:05:58,137 --> 00:06:01,259
[SPEAKER_02]: seek their approval on how we have filled out this document.

70
00:06:02,901 --> 00:06:05,222
[SPEAKER_02]: The document includes any number of things.

71
00:06:05,963 --> 00:06:10,907
[SPEAKER_02]: Once they approve, we will then have to advertise this in three places.

72
00:06:12,548 --> 00:06:17,131
[SPEAKER_02]: We will have to advertise it in what the MSBA calls the central register.

73
00:06:18,232 --> 00:06:23,936
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have to advertise this in a newspaper, and we'll have to advertise this on Combis is my understanding.

74
00:06:27,311 --> 00:06:32,033
[SPEAKER_02]: Generally, they do recommend that we hold an onsite meeting for interested bidders.

75
00:06:33,253 --> 00:06:38,775
[SPEAKER_02]: We will then have to go through a process, which we do have to lay out in the RFS where we.

76
00:06:38,795 --> 00:06:40,856
[SPEAKER_02]: Score all of our.

77
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:54,945
[SPEAKER_02]: All of the bid submissions that we receive, we will then down select to a shortlist service set and invite those folks into visit with us live.

78
00:06:56,106 --> 00:07:02,972
[SPEAKER_02]: We will then call references, make a selection and bring that selection to the.

79
00:07:05,487 --> 00:07:09,288
[SPEAKER_02]: the OPM review panel that is hosted by the MSBA on a monthly basis.

80
00:07:10,308 --> 00:07:18,450
[SPEAKER_02]: Once they agree with our selection through that process, then we're free to move into executing a contract.

81
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:23,231
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's like the process in a teeny tiny nutshell.

82
00:07:23,831 --> 00:07:26,132
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll stop there and find out if there are any questions.

83
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:38,191
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for providing that, yeah, that process in a nutshell.

84
00:07:38,211 --> 00:07:40,171
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds great.

85
00:07:41,132 --> 00:07:41,392
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.

86
00:07:41,592 --> 00:07:44,652
[SPEAKER_02]: And Fiona, I think I did have one question for you.

87
00:07:46,353 --> 00:07:50,854
[SPEAKER_02]: It talked about advertising in the central register, the newspaper and combines.

88
00:07:51,934 --> 00:07:58,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I correct in assuming that your office will be able to handle that upon issue?

89
00:07:59,135 --> 00:07:59,715
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.

90
00:07:59,795 --> 00:08:00,796
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we do every day.

91
00:08:00,816 --> 00:08:00,996
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

92
00:08:01,296 --> 00:08:02,016
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, perfect.

93
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:20,888
[SPEAKER_02]: So really having said all of that, this team will have its work cut out for us as we look at the bid submissions and pick our partner in all of this as we go forward.

94
00:08:23,143 --> 00:08:27,527
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I'm going to share my screen and walk through the RFS with you all.

95
00:08:27,927 --> 00:08:29,328
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm happy to share a copy of this.

96
00:08:29,469 --> 00:08:34,513
[SPEAKER_02]: Once we're done, I meant to share it before now, but I was still working on it, like, 5 minutes ago.

97
00:08:34,593 --> 00:08:36,835
[SPEAKER_02]: So.

98
00:08:37,776 --> 00:08:42,199
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think overall, what we're what we need to make sure that we're doing is.

99
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:55,406
[SPEAKER_02]: Giving bidders an opportunity to know sort of what we're looking for and what we're seeking as well as sort of staying compliant with what the MSBA is asking us to do.

100
00:08:55,426 --> 00:08:58,868
[SPEAKER_02]: So let me pull that up real quick.

101
00:09:00,288 --> 00:09:00,468
[SPEAKER_02]: And.

102
00:09:00,488 --> 00:09:09,553
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to apologize in advance because it's a little.

103
00:09:13,618 --> 00:09:17,140
[SPEAKER_03]: A little wacky with all of the red lines, but that's okay.

104
00:09:25,824 --> 00:09:27,085
[SPEAKER_02]: Can everybody see my screen?

105
00:09:28,345 --> 00:09:28,606
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

106
00:09:29,186 --> 00:09:30,707
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

107
00:09:31,127 --> 00:09:39,111
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the template that the MSBA provides, and the first piece is instructions, right?

108
00:09:41,513 --> 00:09:43,134
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to follow the instructions.

109
00:09:43,955 --> 00:09:52,840
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to review this RFS and make sure that all of our owner specific information is in here.

110
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:57,163
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to review this RFS with our legal counsel.

111
00:09:58,904 --> 00:10:01,786
[SPEAKER_02]: To ensure it's in compliance with our federal, state and local laws.

112
00:10:03,042 --> 00:10:05,084
[SPEAKER_02]: For the school committee, that's Howard Greenspan.

113
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:08,586
[SPEAKER_02]: He is our school committee attorney.

114
00:10:08,667 --> 00:10:14,171
[SPEAKER_02]: So unless Fiona, there is somebody else that typically isn't involved from a procurement perspective.

115
00:10:14,251 --> 00:10:18,955
[SPEAKER_02]: My thought would be to pass this by Howard to make sure that he is on board.

116
00:10:18,995 --> 00:10:19,735
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you agree with that?

117
00:10:20,576 --> 00:10:45,267
[SPEAKER_02]: 100% yes he is yeah okay great um so we'll have to submit this redline version for msba's review prior to advertisement yes the um we will also include um any a series of attachments which i'll talk about later um we'll have to um a copy of the final rfs and advertisement needs to be submitted to the msba um

118
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:50,389
[SPEAKER_02]: with a sample narrative summary and checklist.

119
00:10:50,649 --> 00:10:51,969
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll have to get that done.

120
00:10:53,110 --> 00:11:03,915
[SPEAKER_02]: An owner should allow a minimum of 10 business days for the MSBA to review the RFS and we should not be advertising until MSBA approves.

121
00:11:04,476 --> 00:11:06,757
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are our sort of rules and requirements here.

122
00:11:08,736 --> 00:11:20,182
[SPEAKER_02]: So, as we move forward here, essentially, in this template, everything that's in bold and italics are places where the MSBA is telling us this is for you to fill out.

123
00:11:20,302 --> 00:11:24,864
[SPEAKER_02]: So this 1st section is pretty straightforward.

124
00:11:28,346 --> 00:11:30,067
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of just replacing our.

125
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,941
[SPEAKER_02]: our name and that kind of thing.

126
00:11:35,802 --> 00:11:54,573
[SPEAKER_02]: This part right here, it does talk about potential approved project may include a renovation of an existing school, a renovation of an addition of an existing school, and or new construction, which is why these total project costs have a big range.

127
00:11:55,454 --> 00:11:56,475
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a range that

128
00:11:57,455 --> 00:12:04,338
[SPEAKER_02]: I looked at based on what I see in the marketplace, because if we are going to pursue some sort of renovation, it might be much smaller.

129
00:12:04,378 --> 00:12:07,199
[SPEAKER_02]: If we're pursuing a completely new build, it would be much bigger.

130
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:11,961
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's all dependent on the solution that we all agree to.

131
00:12:12,921 --> 00:12:14,081
[SPEAKER_02]: Questions about that so far?

132
00:12:14,101 --> 00:12:17,983
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

133
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:23,300
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, then, um, it asks for the for background.

134
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,241
[SPEAKER_02]: So this.

135
00:12:25,282 --> 00:12:28,946
[SPEAKER_02]: Did right with the help of my tech, not my.

136
00:12:30,488 --> 00:12:43,052
[SPEAKER_02]: Technological friends over at chat, who have the benefit of all of our documents posted to the website, but essentially what they are asking for here is some.

137
00:12:43,992 --> 00:12:52,695
[SPEAKER_02]: Some information background information about the city, the school building committee, our grade configuration, just things that.

138
00:12:54,996 --> 00:12:55,837
[SPEAKER_02]: are pertinent.

139
00:12:56,157 --> 00:12:58,338
[SPEAKER_02]: So I will read what I've written.

140
00:12:58,358 --> 00:13:03,381
[SPEAKER_02]: I take no offense if you think it's terrible, but we can wordsmith it as we go.

141
00:13:04,802 --> 00:13:11,807
[SPEAKER_02]: The City of Medford, located in the greater Boston area, is a dynamic and growing community that places strong emphasis on educational excellence.

142
00:13:12,627 --> 00:13:19,492
[SPEAKER_02]: The district is committed to providing an inclusive and innovative learning environment with a focus on preparing students for success in a rapidly changing world.

143
00:13:20,172 --> 00:13:26,879
[SPEAKER_02]: The Medford High School, established in the mid-20th century, has served as a cornerstone of the community's educational infrastructure.

144
00:13:27,359 --> 00:13:33,926
[SPEAKER_02]: However, over time, the building has become increasingly outdated and no longer meets the evolving needs of students, educators, or the broader community.

145
00:13:34,486 --> 00:13:43,915
[SPEAKER_02]: The facility's aging systems, limited space, and lack of modern learning environments have prompted the city to pursue significant renovations and improvements to the high school campus.

146
00:13:44,968 --> 00:13:55,578
[SPEAKER_02]: The Medford Comprehensive High School Building Committee is comprised of a diverse group of stakeholders, including elected officials, city officials, school district representatives, and community members with a variety of backgrounds.

147
00:13:56,319 --> 00:14:04,667
[SPEAKER_02]: The committee's primary mission is to oversee the planning execution of the Medford High School project, ensuring that it meets academic, social, and safety needs of students.

148
00:14:05,268 --> 00:14:08,370
[SPEAKER_02]: The committee has broad support to also pursue expansion of

149
00:14:09,051 --> 00:14:19,674
[SPEAKER_02]: It's portfolio chapter 74 programs, it's early childhood programs and to co locate the current Curtis Tufts program to increase access access to programming for students.

150
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:26,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, of this of this school, I used to program a lot in that sentence.

151
00:14:26,151 --> 00:14:27,472
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll fix that.

152
00:14:29,054 --> 00:14:40,444
[SPEAKER_02]: The district's great configuration includes elementary schools, K to 5 middle school, 6 to 8 and the high school grades 9 to 12, the existing high school facility now serves approximately 1200 students and is expected to see future growth.

153
00:14:41,084 --> 00:14:48,451
[SPEAKER_02]: The Medford High School campus also houses athletic facilities, art spaces and administrative offices that serve the school community and the community at large.

154
00:14:49,131 --> 00:15:00,942
[SPEAKER_02]: As part of the ongoing effort to upgrade the district's infrastructure, the Medford Public Schools submitted a statement of interest to the MSBA, highlighting the need for a comprehensive solution to address the building's shortcomings.

155
00:15:02,987 --> 00:15:11,311
[SPEAKER_02]: The accepted services or reference for the project and outlines here is a concern such as structural integrity, accessibility, energy efficiency and technology integration.

156
00:15:11,772 --> 00:15:17,775
[SPEAKER_02]: The project aims not only to enhance learning environment for students, but also to ensure that the school can serve the community for generations to come.

157
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:27,627
[SPEAKER_02]: This request for services seeks to engage qualified professionals who can contribute to the success of this transformative project, providing expertise in design, construction, and project management.

158
00:15:28,167 --> 00:15:45,994
[SPEAKER_02]: The goal of this is to, the goal is to create a state-of-the-art educational facility that fosters creativity, collaboration, and academic excellence, and do the project with substantial community input from the community at large, and specifically from the students and staff who will work, learn, and thrive in the new building.

159
00:15:54,124 --> 00:15:56,646
[SPEAKER_02]: Thoughts, questions, things that are missing.

160
00:15:56,666 --> 00:16:06,216
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that was loud.

161
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:07,037
[SPEAKER_06]: I better myself.

162
00:16:07,778 --> 00:16:09,940
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. fishing.

163
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:12,132
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think it's phenomenal.

164
00:16:12,152 --> 00:16:12,632
[SPEAKER_06]: I really do.

165
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:24,519
[SPEAKER_06]: My only suggestion would be where we talk about facilities, art spaces, perhaps a fine in performing arts, just because one of the things we've tried to do is shift to that performing as well.

166
00:16:31,843 --> 00:16:33,104
[SPEAKER_06]: But I thought it was extremely well done.

167
00:16:50,511 --> 00:16:51,312
[SPEAKER_03]: see arts.

168
00:16:51,412 --> 00:16:52,073
[SPEAKER_03]: Fine.

169
00:16:52,093 --> 00:16:53,715
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

170
00:17:47,088 --> 00:17:50,652
[SPEAKER_03]: Any other questions thoughts about that lead in.

171
00:17:53,355 --> 00:17:54,136
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

172
00:17:55,297 --> 00:17:55,457
[SPEAKER_03]: Um.

173
00:17:58,925 --> 00:18:02,508
[SPEAKER_02]: This section is pretty straightforward.

174
00:18:02,588 --> 00:18:23,142
[SPEAKER_02]: The next thing that we have to provide is to provide specific information regarding the identified school, including, but not limited to the total square footage, site information, age of the building, historical components of the building and or site, if any building conditions and problems, grade structure and enrollment and MSBA agreed upon enrollment.

175
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:24,062
[SPEAKER_02]: So.

176
00:18:26,115 --> 00:18:36,966
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a starting point here that says the Medford High School and Medford Vocational Technical High School complex was constructed during the late 60s and open in the fall of 1970 from its opening until 2017.

177
00:18:37,506 --> 00:18:41,570
[SPEAKER_02]: It has 2 distinct schools, Medford High School and Medford Vocational Technical High School.

178
00:18:42,271 --> 00:18:46,652
[SPEAKER_02]: In 2017, the Medford School Committee voted to merge the two schools into one comprehensive high school.

179
00:18:47,132 --> 00:18:59,036
[SPEAKER_02]: But despite the forward-looking vision aimed at establishing one flagship school to serve as the epicenter of public education for the Medford community, the facility is designed for the delivery of instruction in a bygone era, namely the early 70s.

180
00:19:00,356 --> 00:19:09,299
[SPEAKER_02]: The challenges yielded by its antiquated design have been exacerbated by the increasing severity of infrastructure that ranges from deteriorating to inoperable.

181
00:19:10,179 --> 00:19:10,539
[SPEAKER_02]: M.P.S.

182
00:19:10,639 --> 00:19:19,205
[SPEAKER_02]: envisions Medford High School as a comprehensive high school with a broad array of academic programming and a host of vocational educational programs sanctioned under M.G.L.

183
00:19:19,285 --> 00:19:20,266
[SPEAKER_02]: Chapter 74.

184
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:23,268
[SPEAKER_02]: But the 55-year-old facility housing M.H.S.

185
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:25,890
[SPEAKER_02]: is an obstacle to optimal learning conditions.

186
00:19:26,761 --> 00:19:32,385
[SPEAKER_02]: Medford High School currently serves a combined 1,210 students in grades nine through 12.

187
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:36,188
[SPEAKER_02]: Over 50% of these students are CTE students.

188
00:19:36,728 --> 00:19:46,295
[SPEAKER_02]: Additionally, MHS houses a preschool program that includes X students and a daycare for children ages X to X that has an enrollment of X together.

189
00:19:46,355 --> 00:19:50,778
[SPEAKER_02]: This total enrollment of current students is Y. So we have a few blanks to fill in there.

190
00:19:51,537 --> 00:19:57,780
[SPEAKER_02]: the district's agreed upon enrollment projection for a new M. H. S. Is 1800 students of this figure.

191
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,741
[SPEAKER_02]: 13 95 are grade 9 to 12 high school students.

192
00:20:00,761 --> 00:20:06,083
[SPEAKER_02]: 200 are pre K students and 100 students are students in district state care.

193
00:20:06,563 --> 00:20:12,826
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need to shore up those numbers based on our enrollment certification.

194
00:20:13,647 --> 00:20:17,408
[SPEAKER_02]: But those are placeholders to describe what we've got going on there.

195
00:20:18,168 --> 00:20:18,669
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Graham.

196
00:20:19,129 --> 00:20:19,269
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah,

197
00:20:20,585 --> 00:20:24,028
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we also have to add a placeholder for our 18 to 22 program.

198
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:29,753
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, unless I unless I glossed over it.

199
00:20:31,054 --> 00:20:33,716
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that was one of the things that am I okay to speak?

200
00:20:33,736 --> 00:20:35,338
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely, absolutely.

201
00:20:35,978 --> 00:20:42,644
[SPEAKER_01]: That was going to be one of the things that I was going to say to Peter, and then I can easily get those numbers for you to fill these in.

202
00:20:42,664 --> 00:20:44,886
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

203
00:20:57,537 --> 00:21:01,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Any other thoughts about what might need to be added there?

204
00:21:06,543 --> 00:21:08,424
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Graham, I just had a question.

205
00:21:08,885 --> 00:21:16,730
[SPEAKER_05]: I know we've been in an ongoing discussion with the Curtis Tufts School about implementing what that may look like on the same campus.

206
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:25,796
[SPEAKER_05]: At the very least, is this a place where we might put that about the way we envision having that therapeutic program also implemented in the same building?

207
00:21:26,517 --> 00:21:26,717
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

208
00:21:29,298 --> 00:21:31,019
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great suggestion.

209
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,060
[SPEAKER_02]: Do that.

210
00:21:41,827 --> 00:21:47,531
[SPEAKER_02]: We can come back to this too if we get to the end and think like, oh, there's something else we should be adding.

211
00:21:47,632 --> 00:21:47,812
[SPEAKER_02]: So.

212
00:21:50,296 --> 00:21:52,458
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to speak now or forever hold your peace.

213
00:21:54,099 --> 00:22:05,648
[SPEAKER_02]: The next section is our project objectives under that we're thinking about, and they did provide a list of things that we might want to put in here.

214
00:22:05,668 --> 00:22:09,832
[SPEAKER_02]: I sort of broadly accepted that list.

215
00:22:11,533 --> 00:22:17,297
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just reordered them, so identification of community concerns that may impact study options.

216
00:22:17,537 --> 00:22:23,421
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I think we want to be very upfront that we care about the community input of this process.

217
00:22:25,242 --> 00:22:34,068
[SPEAKER_02]: The Northeast collaborative for high performing schools and or the US green building councils leads for school certification system.

218
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:41,693
[SPEAKER_02]: The life cycle cost of operating the school as it relates to future operational budgets, of course, that's very important.

219
00:22:42,213 --> 00:22:45,414
[SPEAKER_02]: A CM at risk delivery method.

220
00:22:45,514 --> 00:22:49,616
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do think that is a growing trend in school buildings.

221
00:22:50,576 --> 00:22:55,898
[SPEAKER_02]: And given the uncertainty in the environment, we probably definitely want our CMs on board sooner than later.

222
00:22:58,697 --> 00:23:04,241
[SPEAKER_02]: And then planning to ensure learning continuity for all students and particularly for our vocational programs.

223
00:23:04,361 --> 00:23:08,304
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that is one of those things that feels very unique to us.

224
00:23:08,864 --> 00:23:14,228
[SPEAKER_02]: In other schools, if you need to displace students, you have the option of temporary trailers.

225
00:23:14,268 --> 00:23:15,168
[SPEAKER_02]: You have many options.

226
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:22,333
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't put the culinary program in a temporary trailer and think that they are going to be able to continue their education.

227
00:23:22,373 --> 00:23:26,737
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do think we have some particular things there.

228
00:23:27,677 --> 00:23:38,740
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, vetting potential alternate sites, so we have identified a handful of alternate site potentials and we would want to make sure we're doing our due diligence about that.

229
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:45,201
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I did add in site adjustments required to increase the number of egresses from the property.

230
00:23:45,461 --> 00:23:47,422
[SPEAKER_02]: If the new project remains.

231
00:23:48,562 --> 00:23:55,146
[SPEAKER_02]: In place, meaning if Medford high is going to continue to be at 489 Winthrop street.

232
00:23:55,886 --> 00:23:59,529
[SPEAKER_02]: I think 1 thing that we've talked about is the need for.

233
00:23:59,549 --> 00:24:07,313
[SPEAKER_02]: An additional egress and how very complicated that actually is given as where it sits and how it's situated.

234
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:11,215
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I thought that might be a good thing to call out here.

235
00:24:11,275 --> 00:24:13,577
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like something special that we should.

236
00:24:14,429 --> 00:24:19,314
[SPEAKER_02]: Be making people aware of as they think about their, their bid responses to us.

237
00:24:23,397 --> 00:24:27,241
[SPEAKER_02]: Did anybody come up with anything else that we might want to add?

238
00:24:45,166 --> 00:24:48,789
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, we can come back if anybody is inspired.

239
00:24:51,612 --> 00:24:59,239
[SPEAKER_02]: All the rest of this is all very, very standard until we get to evaluation criteria.

240
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:06,686
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we are required to do is be transparent about how we will rate and evaluate

241
00:25:10,048 --> 00:25:16,715
[SPEAKER_02]: our bids and the list here was broadly provided by the template.

242
00:25:16,875 --> 00:25:22,201
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can see that the changes here are really my starting place of points.

243
00:25:23,523 --> 00:25:30,990
[SPEAKER_02]: And then really the only thing I added was like this piece about knowledge and experience with the CM at risk procurement methodology.

244
00:25:32,984 --> 00:25:45,272
[SPEAKER_02]: So, before I go through all of these top to bottom, I actually worked sort of from the bottom up and I. Generally assigned 10 points to the thing that I feel like.

245
00:25:46,012 --> 00:25:48,634
[SPEAKER_02]: We're sort of compulsory, so, um.

246
00:25:49,915 --> 00:25:56,539
[SPEAKER_02]: Mostly down here, like, identifying the current projected workload for projects that are substantial.

247
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,080
[SPEAKER_02]: Familiarity with.

248
00:25:59,668 --> 00:26:17,026
[SPEAKER_02]: the lead certifications and demonstrated experience, knowledge of the purpose and practices of the services of building commissioning consultants, the knowledge of procurement law.

249
00:26:18,428 --> 00:26:20,290
[SPEAKER_02]: Those were the ones that I felt like, okay,

250
00:26:22,237 --> 00:26:25,862
[SPEAKER_02]: You sort of aren't in this game if you don't know those things.

251
00:26:26,583 --> 00:26:27,644
[SPEAKER_02]: So I sort of.

252
00:26:28,145 --> 00:26:39,180
[SPEAKER_02]: Gave that, like, a compulsory level 10 points and then from there, I said, okay, what are the things that sort of escalate and are, but are still, like, what I would consider to be sort of.

253
00:26:39,901 --> 00:26:41,041
[SPEAKER_02]: Table stakes, right?

254
00:26:41,081 --> 00:26:52,204
[SPEAKER_02]: So things like knowledge and demonstrated experience with life cycle cost analysis and cost estimating with actual examples of how they've done this in various communities.

255
00:26:54,124 --> 00:26:57,425
[SPEAKER_02]: And the CM at risk felt like something that was a little bit.

256
00:26:58,645 --> 00:27:04,387
[SPEAKER_02]: Less everybody does this, so that felt like something that might warrant.

257
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:25,159
[SPEAKER_02]: 20 points as well as a little bit of increased emphasis on state building code, particularly around the ADA, because I think we have a lot of energy and need to make sure that our buildings are compliant and serve students with all kinds of abilities.

258
00:27:26,368 --> 00:27:29,770
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was sort of my 20-point bracket, as it were.

259
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:36,615
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there was like a 30-point bracket, which was really capacity and skills.

260
00:27:36,635 --> 00:27:51,144
[SPEAKER_02]: So talk to us about how many people you have and how they would be involved in our project, the management approach, and the kinds of things that they're thinking about.

261
00:27:54,367 --> 00:28:00,089
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was 1 more 30 point that was it then there was a 40 point.

262
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:05,471
[SPEAKER_02]: Bracket around key personnel, so who are these people that are going to work with us every day?

263
00:28:05,491 --> 00:28:09,813
[SPEAKER_02]: And are they people that are a good fit for us with their experience and their.

264
00:28:11,067 --> 00:28:28,988
[SPEAKER_02]: their approach to school buildings, and then 50 points being allocated to past performance and the kinds of projects that they've worked on that align with what we're looking to do.

265
00:28:33,092 --> 00:28:37,774
[SPEAKER_02]: That all tallies up to 270 points, which is why we have such an odd scale.

266
00:28:38,314 --> 00:28:57,080
[SPEAKER_02]: But I felt like it was easier to keep the points section normalized and bracketed like that than it was to try to get to 100 points, because then we'd be awarding 12 points and 17 points and on and on.

267
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:00,061
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I go back to the top.

268
00:29:03,358 --> 00:29:08,782
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy for you all to tell me that's the craziest thing you've ever heard.

269
00:29:09,323 --> 00:29:10,884
[SPEAKER_02]: Trying to make sense of this list.

270
00:29:11,024 --> 00:29:19,410
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was nice to have a starting list from the MSBA to say this is what we, you know, these are the kinds of things we should be looking at.

271
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:24,033
[SPEAKER_02]: And so with the exception of the CMNet risk, the list really didn't change.

272
00:29:24,053 --> 00:29:29,957
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just curious if anybody has any thoughts or feedback on like the points allocation here.

273
00:29:44,461 --> 00:29:52,048
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I will fill these X's and Y's in.

274
00:29:52,068 --> 00:30:09,023
[SPEAKER_02]: And then once we complete that process of reviewing the.

275
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:18,782
[SPEAKER_02]: Respondents we then create a short list essentially of the highest scoring.

276
00:30:18,802 --> 00:30:28,906
[SPEAKER_02]: And 1st, and then we would then sort of start over with the ranking and talk about.

277
00:30:31,096 --> 00:30:37,163
[SPEAKER_02]: How we plan to do that I actually was surprised they didn't have anything super specific about this.

278
00:30:37,244 --> 00:30:44,693
[SPEAKER_02]: So I basically said at this point, we're going to talk about the quality of 3 reference checks.

279
00:30:46,775 --> 00:30:52,420
[SPEAKER_02]: The quality of the finalist presentation and the value presented in the cost proposal.

280
00:30:53,661 --> 00:30:58,004
[SPEAKER_02]: So, not to say it's going to be the lowest bid, but the best value.

281
00:30:58,024 --> 00:31:04,029
[SPEAKER_02]: Did all things considered so this, I felt like it was a little easier to like, tally to 100 points.

282
00:31:06,631 --> 00:31:09,794
[SPEAKER_02]: And welcome any additions to this list.

283
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:17,052
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Graham, I just have a quick question that perhaps Fiona or Bob could answer.

284
00:31:17,692 --> 00:31:39,244
[SPEAKER_06]: When we talk about value presented in the bidder's cost proposal, is this something that will open the cost proposal in line with the bid, or is this something that, as I know happens in other situations, you rank, you make your selection, and then you open that one cost proposal?

285
00:31:43,283 --> 00:31:48,225
[SPEAKER_00]: So, great question, Peter, as we're dealing with HVAC.

286
00:31:49,626 --> 00:31:56,709
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, you would, we would want to, I think it's a great point system, Jenny.

287
00:31:56,729 --> 00:32:03,472
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that, you know, there doesn't need to be an even number, but, you know, you need to know what your overall number is.

288
00:32:03,492 --> 00:32:12,756
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want to rank our, you know, our proposers, and then we definitely want to,

289
00:32:14,179 --> 00:32:37,698
[SPEAKER_00]: put emphasis on the interviews because I think that's where you're going to see that vendor, you know, and that's where you want to focus on your analogy and summary and then we open the price proposal piece of it.

290
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:48,067
[SPEAKER_02]: Fiona, are you saying that the cost proposal cannot be a factor in our finalist selection?

291
00:32:50,047 --> 00:32:51,068
[SPEAKER_00]: So it depends.

292
00:32:52,268 --> 00:33:00,370
[SPEAKER_00]: And this may be a little different than what I'm used to as far as an RFP process or a request for qualifications as well.

293
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:05,552
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not 100% familiar with the CM at risk.

294
00:33:05,612 --> 00:33:10,433
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually taking a class next month, and we're actually dealing with that with an HVAC project.

295
00:33:11,384 --> 00:33:30,160
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cost is important, but it's not necessarily the factor that determines your, you know, your end result.

296
00:33:32,337 --> 00:33:44,069
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, so I just changed it a little bit to say that the final 20 points is based on the value presented in the bidder's technical response and the cost proposal.

297
00:33:44,109 --> 00:33:45,971
[SPEAKER_02]: Because to me, it's a package deal, right?

298
00:33:46,011 --> 00:33:51,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, if Paul wants to charge $10 and he's going to give us

299
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:57,025
[SPEAKER_02]: 2 widgets and Aaron is going to charge us 20 dollars.

300
00:33:57,326 --> 00:34:03,533
[SPEAKER_02]: And in fact, we assess that the very same 2 widgets are available, like.

301
00:34:04,154 --> 00:34:08,339
[SPEAKER_02]: The value conversation sort of shifts to cost, but if.

302
00:34:09,188 --> 00:34:11,429
[SPEAKER_02]: Paul's widgets and Aaron's widgets aren't the same.

303
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:22,757
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to make a value decision about which widget we want and how then the cost lines up with those choices.

304
00:34:22,857 --> 00:34:32,943
[SPEAKER_02]: So to me, in a finalist situation, you would want to be thinking about cost at least on some level, but in a value context.

305
00:34:33,123 --> 00:34:35,605
[SPEAKER_02]: So does that change of wording make it

306
00:34:37,868 --> 00:34:40,070
[SPEAKER_02]: okay from a procurement perspective, Fiona?

307
00:34:42,652 --> 00:34:46,795
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have to like really look at that more deeply, to be honest with you.

308
00:34:47,416 --> 00:34:52,540
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think highlighting it and sharing it, I can look into that more.

309
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,440
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

310
00:34:54,401 --> 00:34:54,601
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

311
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:57,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

312
00:34:57,203 --> 00:35:00,446
[SPEAKER_02]: So I will put this for you to take a look at.

313
00:35:01,006 --> 00:35:01,367
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

314
00:35:02,672 --> 00:35:27,168
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, this is, I think, a super important conversation about this because, I mean, not to poo-poo Medford High School, but, you know, we could get somebody who wants to just take everything out of the box, you know, doesn't actually want to do anything new or interesting, and

315
00:35:29,241 --> 00:35:35,904
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, if it's just like a road activity for them, then of course this should cost less.

316
00:35:35,964 --> 00:35:36,224
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

317
00:35:37,144 --> 00:35:55,851
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so I think that costs of course matters, but, um, but what are we getting is, is really the, it's not, I mean, if, if the only thing we actually think is even reasonably affordable is this out of the box kind of like, um,

318
00:35:57,118 --> 00:36:11,765
[SPEAKER_07]: cookie cutter thing, that's our decision, but we don't wanna be tied to the fact that a cookie cutter approach might in fact be half the price, I mean, or whatever.

319
00:36:12,045 --> 00:36:14,727
[SPEAKER_07]: So I like this conversation.

320
00:36:14,847 --> 00:36:24,612
[SPEAKER_07]: I think figuring out how to get this so that we have the freedom to do this the way we want rather than just, we're not buying,

321
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:28,567
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not we're not asking like, for bids to buy 10.

322
00:36:29,288 --> 00:36:32,992
[SPEAKER_07]: Of some widget that you can get on Amazon, so.

323
00:36:35,354 --> 00:36:38,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I guess my thinking was that.

324
00:36:41,921 --> 00:36:44,724
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if I were doing this evaluation.

325
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:49,677
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be the last, you know, we, that would be the last thing we would do.

326
00:36:49,737 --> 00:36:51,077
[SPEAKER_02]: We would open those.

327
00:36:51,537 --> 00:37:02,641
[SPEAKER_02]: Those cost bids at the after the presentations are done after the scoring is complete for the reference tracks, and then that would be like, the final way for us to say, okay.

328
00:37:03,771 --> 00:37:05,893
[SPEAKER_02]: Where do my points go now?

329
00:37:06,033 --> 00:37:10,536
[SPEAKER_02]: What am I willing to assign based on the bigger picture?

330
00:37:12,077 --> 00:37:13,098
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was my thoughts.

331
00:37:13,118 --> 00:37:20,704
[SPEAKER_02]: So Fiona, I will send you a copy of this so you can just take a look at that and confirm that that works.

332
00:37:21,545 --> 00:37:28,070
[SPEAKER_02]: My thoughts on next steps are to bring this to the building committee on Monday the 24th and get there.

333
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:37,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, get their agreement and their feedback, obviously, because we have lots of talented qualified people in the mix.

334
00:37:37,532 --> 00:37:37,692
[SPEAKER_02]: Um.

335
00:37:39,153 --> 00:37:47,035
[SPEAKER_02]: At our larger committee, so we would want to get their input and then we'll be ready to send this to the pretty quickly.

336
00:37:47,055 --> 00:37:51,696
[SPEAKER_02]: And to get their feedback.

337
00:37:53,097 --> 00:37:53,557
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds good.

338
00:37:54,117 --> 00:37:54,297
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

339
00:37:56,544 --> 00:38:04,667
[SPEAKER_02]: So this next section gets a little bit wacky.

340
00:38:06,168 --> 00:38:19,374
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to outline our selection process and include adequate documentation of rankings,

341
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:26,903
[SPEAKER_02]: which I believe we have basically done at this point.

342
00:38:31,365 --> 00:38:32,525
[SPEAKER_02]: So we should be good there.

343
00:38:32,545 --> 00:38:36,887
[SPEAKER_02]: We will have to fill some of this out.

344
00:38:36,927 --> 00:38:40,669
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the OPM selection committee.

345
00:38:40,689 --> 00:38:48,112
[SPEAKER_02]: And we will talk through this process that we will identify and describe the interview process.

346
00:38:51,541 --> 00:38:56,825
[SPEAKER_02]: And the committee's basis of ranking after the interviews, we will outline how the owner plans to negotiate the fee.

347
00:38:58,066 --> 00:39:04,851
[SPEAKER_02]: So, those are things that we have to do in this process as well as if I scroll down.

348
00:39:04,871 --> 00:39:12,697
[SPEAKER_02]: And we may want to include provisions to re, advertise if we get not enough.

349
00:39:15,183 --> 00:39:23,304
[SPEAKER_02]: Responses so this I didn't actually make that much progress filling out, but would welcome any thoughts or comments on this section.

350
00:39:40,227 --> 00:39:44,108
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just not sure what the statute requirements are on that section so.

351
00:39:45,474 --> 00:39:48,415
[SPEAKER_00]: um, as it relates to, you know, this type of project.

352
00:39:48,455 --> 00:39:55,658
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, you could highlight that maybe Jenny and I can take a look at that section as well.

353
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:07,842
[SPEAKER_02]: So it does talk about the identified reviewers must rank their responses based on the weighted evaluation criteria.

354
00:40:08,863 --> 00:40:12,184
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and must shortlist our minimum of three responses.

355
00:40:12,224 --> 00:40:13,945
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't really have choices there.

356
00:40:13,985 --> 00:40:14,805
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a requirement.

357
00:40:17,329 --> 00:40:29,394
[SPEAKER_02]: We do have to describe our interview process and we'll talk about the dates in just a 2nd, but I'm guessing this is a place where we might want to say, like, we will invite.

358
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:41,866
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, we may say, like, we'll invite shortlisted respondents to a meeting that is not to exceed a certain amount of time.

359
00:40:41,886 --> 00:40:48,390
[SPEAKER_02]: And in that meeting, they'll be invited to provide an overview of their proposal.

360
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:50,591
[SPEAKER_02]: And in advance of that meeting.

361
00:40:52,311 --> 00:40:59,294
[SPEAKER_02]: We may provide them a list of questions to, um, to respond to that are specific to the details of their proposal.

362
00:40:59,754 --> 00:41:01,214
[SPEAKER_02]: So we could do something like that.

363
00:41:02,055 --> 00:41:08,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I don't know if you have typical language that you use for something like that, or if anybody has any suggestions or thoughts.

364
00:41:09,237 --> 00:41:18,501
[SPEAKER_02]: That, um, about the time, you know, what is an appropriate amount of time for such a finalist meeting to be.

365
00:41:22,592 --> 00:41:33,298
[SPEAKER_06]: We have spent for the HVAC OPM and CM interviews, I believe, well, I know because some were yesterday, but about an hour and a half to two hours for each interview.

366
00:41:35,319 --> 00:41:35,639
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

367
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,701
[SPEAKER_00]: And, oh, go ahead, Fiona.

368
00:41:40,182 --> 00:41:51,608
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just going to say, and to Peter's point, I just know with the HVAC project, so the requirement is to receive a minimum of X amount of bids or proposals.

369
00:41:52,444 --> 00:41:55,806
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's three off the top of my head for the CM at risk.

370
00:41:55,886 --> 00:42:04,291
[SPEAKER_00]: But as long as you receive the minimum of three, you don't necessarily have to interview those three.

371
00:42:04,431 --> 00:42:06,553
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be a minimum of two.

372
00:42:06,573 --> 00:42:12,316
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the requirement is just receiving at least three.

373
00:42:12,356 --> 00:42:21,302
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I said I'm not sure how or what that language, the requirement needs to be.

374
00:42:22,592 --> 00:42:26,396
[SPEAKER_02]: So Miss, the MSBA requires that we talk to three people.

375
00:42:27,057 --> 00:42:27,337
[SPEAKER_02]: It does?

376
00:42:27,498 --> 00:42:27,698
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

377
00:42:27,758 --> 00:42:28,158
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

378
00:42:28,198 --> 00:42:28,379
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

379
00:42:28,459 --> 00:42:29,800
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to shortlist three.

380
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:30,881
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.

381
00:42:31,642 --> 00:42:37,309
[SPEAKER_00]: So to Peter's point, we had a list of four.

382
00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:43,636
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we did two interviews, about two hours each.

383
00:42:59,877 --> 00:43:09,241
[SPEAKER_06]: And so everyone's also aware, the visiting team will bring a full team of individuals.

384
00:43:11,622 --> 00:43:16,624
[SPEAKER_06]: Upwards of 10 or more people have been on those interviews presenting by the companies.

385
00:43:17,304 --> 00:43:17,424
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

386
00:43:26,535 --> 00:43:40,788
[SPEAKER_02]: So, what I am saying here is no longer than 2 hours in length and the interview will include an opportunity for the better to present an overview of their proposal and a chance to answer questions that we provide to them at least 48 hours in advance.

387
00:43:41,128 --> 00:43:46,093
[SPEAKER_02]: Does anyone have any other thoughts about what that bullet might need to say?

388
00:43:58,962 --> 00:44:06,088
[SPEAKER_02]: The next one says, outline how the owner plans to negotiate the fee and what documentation the owner will require.

389
00:44:06,108 --> 00:44:12,194
[SPEAKER_02]: I was curious, Fiona, if you had any input on what that might mean.

390
00:44:14,856 --> 00:44:19,921
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not 100% sure what exactly that means and what that language should look like.

391
00:44:23,629 --> 00:44:28,513
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can mark that maybe for me to look at, Jenny?

392
00:44:30,894 --> 00:44:43,684
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure, because I do know that the language in the CM at risk we just did for the HVAC had some specific language that actually we are re-looking at.

393
00:44:45,868 --> 00:44:47,308
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, if you could highlight that for me.

394
00:44:47,888 --> 00:44:50,209
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't for the CM at risk.

395
00:44:50,269 --> 00:44:51,389
[SPEAKER_00]: It's for the OPM.

396
00:44:52,289 --> 00:44:53,949
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I understand that.

397
00:44:54,049 --> 00:44:59,430
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just want to make sure that I'm looking at the OPM that we hired for the CM at risk.

398
00:44:59,490 --> 00:45:07,652
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just know the CM at risk language was, we really narrowed in looking at that language yesterday.

399
00:45:07,692 --> 00:45:11,993
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to make sure that we're accurate with that language that is for this.

400
00:45:12,553 --> 00:45:12,833
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.

401
00:45:13,433 --> 00:45:14,213
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

402
00:45:16,609 --> 00:45:35,645
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did change this to a requirement saying that we reserve the right to re-advertise if less than three responses are received or to re-advertise if fee negotiations fail.

403
00:45:42,930 --> 00:45:46,013
[SPEAKER_03]: If we move on to the timeline,

404
00:45:47,487 --> 00:45:58,991
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, what I did, I actually sent some questions to our contact to just get a little bit more context about this review cycle.

405
00:46:00,051 --> 00:46:01,531
[SPEAKER_02]: So, this timeline.

406
00:46:03,572 --> 00:46:06,193
[SPEAKER_02]: Anchors to 2 things 1 is that we're like.

407
00:46:06,993 --> 00:46:12,214
[SPEAKER_02]: ready to post this the day after we get the go-ahead to do so, so that is still very much a TBD.

408
00:46:12,995 --> 00:46:22,237
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other thing this anchors to is the scheduled OPM review panel meeting that happens in early April.

409
00:46:24,978 --> 00:46:35,661
[SPEAKER_02]: They happen on a monthly basis, so pending information from our contact about the review timeline up front and then the

410
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:46,183
[SPEAKER_02]: The process to be at an OPM review panel meeting, we may need to slide this whole thing in 1 direction or another.

411
00:46:46,843 --> 00:46:48,924
[SPEAKER_02]: But my goal is that we're ready to go.

412
00:46:49,044 --> 00:46:49,964
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I think.

413
00:46:50,905 --> 00:47:00,068
[SPEAKER_02]: A few, as you look at this timeline, I would think about it in terms of its proximity 1 step to the next, knowing that the whole thing could slide.

414
00:47:00,889 --> 00:47:03,835
[SPEAKER_02]: Out based on some input from.

415
00:47:04,396 --> 00:47:06,700
[SPEAKER_02]: So, would it happen faster than this or sooner than this?

416
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:11,109
[SPEAKER_02]: But it could happen later than this and sort of we would slide the whole thing accordingly.

417
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:22,565
[SPEAKER_02]: Having said that, 2-27 would be the date that we push this in the central register, as well as a newspaper, et cetera.

418
00:47:24,486 --> 00:47:29,868
[SPEAKER_02]: We would hold an informational meeting and site inspection on 3-6, which is about a week later.

419
00:47:29,888 --> 00:47:36,412
[SPEAKER_02]: The following day, we would have it be the last day for questions from respondents.

420
00:47:37,872 --> 00:47:45,214
[SPEAKER_02]: The following week we would have responses due so that does give bidders like two full weeks to put their responses together.

421
00:47:45,234 --> 00:47:48,615
[SPEAKER_02]: And my understanding is that's pretty typical.

422
00:47:50,336 --> 00:47:56,338
[SPEAKER_02]: Then by the following week, we would have done our work to identify who the shortlisted participants are.

423
00:47:57,418 --> 00:48:00,059
[SPEAKER_02]: A week after that, within the next week, we would.

424
00:48:01,767 --> 00:48:06,308
[SPEAKER_02]: Interview our shortlist respondents and we'll publish the 2 dates where we would plan to do that.

425
00:48:06,848 --> 00:48:11,129
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll sort of block time for whoever the committee is in order to be able to do that.

426
00:48:12,530 --> 00:48:17,191
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we would begin negotiations immediately filing, which is like the Monday.

427
00:48:17,211 --> 00:48:20,512
[SPEAKER_02]: We would let MSBA know on.

428
00:48:21,652 --> 00:48:24,673
[SPEAKER_02]: Or 1, and then by 4, 7, we're ready to talk to the.

429
00:48:25,872 --> 00:48:32,155
[SPEAKER_02]: Opium review panel and with an expectation that we finish the contract by the end of April.

430
00:48:35,156 --> 00:48:38,098
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that feel Jenny?

431
00:48:38,138 --> 00:48:38,678
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll jump in.

432
00:48:38,858 --> 00:48:39,659
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my area of.

433
00:48:43,171 --> 00:48:43,752
[SPEAKER_00]: experience.

434
00:48:44,312 --> 00:48:52,998
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we could work with this schedule, but just minor, minor logistics and details.

435
00:48:54,379 --> 00:49:07,208
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, an advertised date in the central register of 227 automatically makes me look at my calendar and you need to realize there's lead times when the advertising date is due and then

436
00:49:08,522 --> 00:49:11,523
[SPEAKER_00]: the availability is due.

437
00:49:11,543 --> 00:49:14,144
[SPEAKER_00]: So those automatically get pushed out about six or seven days.

438
00:49:15,084 --> 00:49:25,768
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as far as the informational meeting and site inspection, that gets pushed out a little bit because of the advertised date and the center register and the local paper and the minimum requirements.

439
00:49:26,389 --> 00:49:33,992
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to share that timeline with me, I can edit that and be mindful of other people's time right now.

440
00:49:34,612 --> 00:49:37,633
[SPEAKER_00]: I could edit that to reflect some true timeframes.

441
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:49,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, and in order to do that, Fiona, I think what you're saying is there is no chance for us to be at the review panel meeting on the 7th of April.

442
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:52,244
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what you're saying?

443
00:49:52,784 --> 00:49:54,225
[SPEAKER_00]: If I look at a quick calendar.

444
00:50:00,147 --> 00:50:00,667
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not.

445
00:50:02,948 --> 00:50:05,149
[SPEAKER_00]: No, just on my phone looking at a quick calendar.

446
00:50:05,169 --> 00:50:06,249
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not.

447
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:13,511
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have to probably estimate to push that out about a week or so.

448
00:50:13,531 --> 00:50:17,952
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, because those review panel meetings are fixed.

449
00:50:18,672 --> 00:50:21,092
[SPEAKER_02]: Meetings like, they are on a calendar that.

450
00:50:21,732 --> 00:50:32,034
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not ours, so 2 things I can send you this timeline and we can make those adjustments and I can also seek some guidance from MSBA about.

451
00:50:33,895 --> 00:50:36,535
[SPEAKER_02]: The lead time required and and.

452
00:50:38,276 --> 00:50:38,636
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether.

453
00:50:41,148 --> 00:50:45,948
[SPEAKER_02]: We do need to in fact slide this out or if there's some other way they would ground this for communities that are ready to go.

454
00:50:47,027 --> 00:50:59,397
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, you and I could probably talk about that offline because, you know, when you talk about a 227 appears in the center register, that puts a 219 deadline date that it has to be submitted.

455
00:50:59,577 --> 00:51:00,418
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's next week.

456
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:05,341
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so if we're ready, you know, I'm not opposed to it, certainly not.

457
00:51:05,361 --> 00:51:08,024
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love the aggressive timeline.

458
00:51:08,064 --> 00:51:11,927
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm just saying logistically, we need to be realistic.

459
00:51:12,867 --> 00:51:13,468
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.

460
00:51:14,115 --> 00:51:15,216
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate that.

461
00:51:16,778 --> 00:51:21,003
[SPEAKER_02]: So it sounds like we do have to shift everything out maybe by 1 week.

462
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:28,111
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the only question then, and maybe you and I can look at the timeline and figure out.

463
00:51:28,773 --> 00:51:32,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, if there's a possibility for us to.

464
00:51:33,075 --> 00:51:36,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Make this selection more quickly, like, what would that entail?

465
00:51:38,318 --> 00:51:45,042
[SPEAKER_02]: So, let me get some answers to that from our contact and then I will circle up with you.

466
00:51:45,062 --> 00:51:47,163
[SPEAKER_02]: About, of course, okay.

467
00:51:48,464 --> 00:51:53,367
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect and then I think from a select, we have to.

468
00:51:54,372 --> 00:51:57,373
[SPEAKER_02]: determine whether we're going to add folks to the selection committee or not.

469
00:51:58,013 --> 00:52:07,617
[SPEAKER_02]: But then we also will need to block the dates and times for the meetings that we'll have to have to do these reviews.

470
00:52:10,958 --> 00:52:22,122
[SPEAKER_02]: Fiona, since this is all subject to the open meeting law, our meetings are open to the public.

471
00:52:25,208 --> 00:52:47,540
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess my question is, how do we protect, I guess, various bidders from their competitors sitting through these conversations?

472
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:49,741
[SPEAKER_02]: How is that done, typically?

473
00:52:52,663 --> 00:52:53,604
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good question.

474
00:52:53,964 --> 00:52:54,545
[SPEAKER_00]: Great question.

475
00:52:55,205 --> 00:53:04,013
[SPEAKER_00]: So the RFP process is a unique process that, you know, is subject to the statute.

476
00:53:05,034 --> 00:53:15,464
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess I'm not 100% sure how to answer that as far as, you know, public input.

477
00:53:17,265 --> 00:53:18,586
[SPEAKER_00]: The evaluation committee is

478
00:53:21,856 --> 00:53:27,758
[SPEAKER_00]: is a committee that's established before any evaluations are done.

479
00:53:27,778 --> 00:53:46,444
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and it, the RFP process, you know, doesn't, typically under certain statute or certain sections of the statute, it doesn't require us to have any

480
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:57,441
[SPEAKER_00]: public information access, I guess is the better word.

481
00:53:58,061 --> 00:54:04,182
[SPEAKER_00]: But depending on the statute and how it's done, there may be certain things that are required.

482
00:54:04,742 --> 00:54:07,183
[SPEAKER_00]: We are required to share with the public.

483
00:54:07,243 --> 00:54:15,404
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not sure how this process works, but I can certainly look into that.

484
00:54:15,424 --> 00:54:17,565
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

485
00:54:17,705 --> 00:54:18,145
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Ruseau?

486
00:54:19,301 --> 00:54:33,802
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, yes, I am wondering, though, if the, uh, in the executive session, um, exceptions, um, one of them is, um, specifically to consider the purchase exchange release of real property, um,

487
00:54:36,873 --> 00:54:40,654
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just wondering if that doesn't provide an exemption.

488
00:54:41,134 --> 00:54:53,178
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the other things I'm noticing here is that when we do a search for a new superintendent in the early phases, those are not open to the public.

489
00:54:53,198 --> 00:54:59,480
[SPEAKER_07]: And this feels very much like that kind of scenario where

490
00:55:00,904 --> 00:55:05,126
[SPEAKER_07]: it being open to the public would be detrimental to our position.

491
00:55:06,106 --> 00:55:07,666
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't know.

492
00:55:07,806 --> 00:55:15,809
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, this is, you know, outside of the area that I typically think about when I think about executive sessions.

493
00:55:15,929 --> 00:55:20,731
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'd have to give advice, but doing it in public would be terrible.

494
00:55:21,431 --> 00:55:22,371
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.

495
00:55:22,612 --> 00:55:27,073
[SPEAKER_00]: And the real property disposition of real property is totally different.

496
00:55:27,293 --> 00:55:29,474
[SPEAKER_00]: So that, um,

497
00:55:30,139 --> 00:55:31,441
[SPEAKER_00]: falls under a different statute.

498
00:55:31,521 --> 00:55:37,049
[SPEAKER_00]: So that actually does require us to provide the information to the public.

499
00:55:37,069 --> 00:55:40,354
[SPEAKER_00]: But under this, it may be different.

500
00:55:42,388 --> 00:55:58,322
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the central thing that may be different in this procurement is that the procurement is being done by a body that is subject to the open meeting law, which is completely different than how a typical procurement in the city would work.

501
00:55:58,462 --> 00:55:58,783
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?

502
00:55:58,823 --> 00:56:00,944
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, certainly there's public records, but.

503
00:56:01,955 --> 00:56:06,617
[SPEAKER_02]: You all don't work under the open meeting law in the same way that.

504
00:56:07,337 --> 00:56:17,001
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, we do on the school committee, or this body does so I can seek some clarification from MSBA about that as well in terms of, like, how do all of these things fit together?

505
00:56:17,021 --> 00:56:19,943
[SPEAKER_02]: So I will see what I can come up with there too.

506
00:56:20,263 --> 00:56:21,303
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very interesting.

507
00:56:21,343 --> 00:56:23,124
[SPEAKER_03]: Kim.

508
00:56:24,845 --> 00:56:25,125
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

509
00:56:26,534 --> 00:56:32,977
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the rest of this is.

510
00:56:35,538 --> 00:56:39,699
[SPEAKER_02]: Sort of filling in some of the same information that has been held elsewhere.

511
00:56:39,719 --> 00:56:43,300
[SPEAKER_02]: We are requiring hard copies, so we'll need to.

512
00:56:43,801 --> 00:56:46,962
[SPEAKER_02]: Determine how big the committee is, so we can make sure we get enough copies.

513
00:56:48,641 --> 00:57:02,919
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if I keep going, there's a section here that says the owner shall list any and all certifications here that the respondent will be required to submit as attachment D required certifications.

514
00:57:04,540 --> 00:57:08,322
[SPEAKER_02]: The owner should consult with its legal counsel to determine what certifications may be required.

515
00:57:08,482 --> 00:57:19,246
[SPEAKER_02]: So Fiona, I didn't know if this was a question for Howard or a question for you in terms of what certifications we may be requiring people to provide at this stage.

516
00:57:19,746 --> 00:57:20,026
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

517
00:57:20,066 --> 00:57:21,607
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would put that as both.

518
00:57:22,427 --> 00:57:27,389
[SPEAKER_00]: That is something that typically procurement would check with legal.

519
00:57:28,830 --> 00:57:30,070
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can do that.

520
00:57:30,090 --> 00:57:31,651
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

521
00:57:33,565 --> 00:57:34,887
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we keep going.

522
00:57:38,946 --> 00:57:44,851
[SPEAKER_02]: All of this is very typical and then we get to the end and there's a series of attachments here.

523
00:57:44,871 --> 00:57:47,853
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll need to provide all of these documents.

524
00:57:48,854 --> 00:58:02,606
[SPEAKER_02]: What I did add to it is our educational profile and our chapter 74 viability program because we worked really hard on those documents and describing what we thought the educational programming should be here in Medford that is driving our

525
00:58:05,237 --> 00:58:06,698
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, thoughts around this building.

526
00:58:06,818 --> 00:58:11,762
[SPEAKER_02]: So those things will need to be attached as well.

527
00:58:11,822 --> 00:58:13,863
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and those documents exist, so that's not a problem.

528
00:58:18,287 --> 00:58:26,533
[SPEAKER_02]: And everything else is boilerplate attachment for the bidders to fill out.

529
00:58:29,135 --> 00:58:33,798
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, that's it.

530
00:58:38,587 --> 00:58:42,931
[SPEAKER_03]: Questions, thoughts, places you want to go back to?

531
00:59:09,775 --> 00:59:12,976
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think there are maybe two things left to do.

532
00:59:14,137 --> 00:59:27,843
[SPEAKER_02]: One might be a motion to bring this for a final input with its amendments to the full committee.

533
00:59:29,304 --> 00:59:33,145
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other might be to recommend to the committee

534
00:59:36,359 --> 00:59:42,346
[SPEAKER_02]: An expansion of this team of voting members, which right now stands at Dr Cushing Aaron and myself.

535
00:59:43,287 --> 00:59:43,648
[SPEAKER_02]: So.

536
00:59:45,250 --> 00:59:52,699
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the 2 things are on my mind that we may want to do in terms of votes tonight so that we can be prepared to bring those back to the committee.

537
00:59:52,719 --> 00:59:56,223
[SPEAKER_02]: On the 24th thoughts about that.

538
00:59:59,068 --> 01:00:09,952
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Graham, did you have an idea about the amount of people you wanted to bring in as voting members, or did you want to see how people felt about increasing the number and go from there?

539
01:00:12,252 --> 01:00:17,354
[SPEAKER_02]: What my main feeling was that maybe it shouldn't be just the three of us making this decision.

540
01:00:17,374 --> 01:00:24,216
[SPEAKER_02]: But I hadn't really, you know, an odd number seems prudent.

541
01:00:26,622 --> 01:00:32,687
[SPEAKER_02]: So I hadn't really thought about it or the makeup of those additional folks any further.

542
01:00:34,448 --> 01:00:36,690
[SPEAKER_02]: So totally open to suggestions.

543
01:00:43,077 --> 01:00:47,360
[SPEAKER_06]: Memogram, one thing I would say is it is a significant time commitment.

544
01:00:48,801 --> 01:00:58,727
[SPEAKER_06]: So rather than, I think, for us to say the specific makeup, I definitely have people in certain job types that I think would be really tremendous additions.

545
01:00:59,348 --> 01:01:10,355
[SPEAKER_06]: But I mean, it is a tremendous time commitment to be able to, one, review the technical proposals, score the technical proposals, and then participate in the interviews and discuss.

546
01:01:12,439 --> 01:01:16,622
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it all depends on how many people on how many organizations submit.

547
01:01:17,243 --> 01:01:29,872
[SPEAKER_06]: But each one having gone through it on the HVAC side for OPM and CM to review the proposals and participate in usually takes between four and five hours.

548
01:01:31,914 --> 01:01:33,595
[SPEAKER_06]: Just to be fully transparent.

549
01:01:38,557 --> 01:01:50,086
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree with Peter, it is time consuming, but I would suggest, as you mentioned an odd number, but I would suggest almost increasing that from 3 to at least 5.

550
01:01:52,588 --> 01:01:55,090
[SPEAKER_03]: Is adding to make sense.

551
01:02:02,255 --> 01:02:03,016
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me just think for a 2nd.

552
01:02:03,036 --> 01:02:03,116
[SPEAKER_06]: So.

553
01:02:06,850 --> 01:02:27,263
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd say a minimum of two, possibly as many as four, but it's just because it's really great to hear what people have to say around the table as you're going through the interviews and reviewing them, and what I may have seen, another person may have missed, or what I may have missed, another person may have seen.

554
01:02:27,763 --> 01:02:34,087
[SPEAKER_06]: And so there's really tremendous value from that collaborative approach, especially on something as important as this project.

555
01:02:35,771 --> 01:02:38,013
[SPEAKER_06]: So I mean, definitely a minimum of two, but.

556
01:02:44,837 --> 01:03:01,209
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I would I would agree, I think at least two, we have, I believe, 15 voting members, so I don't find it'll be difficult to find other members who would both be willing and excited about the opportunity, but also have some consideration that might be outside of our perspectives thus far.

557
01:03:03,130 --> 01:03:12,198
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's probably best to go back to the larger group and let them also hear this and see what people's perspectives are.

558
01:03:12,218 --> 01:03:15,281
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I think the time commitment seems like a large one.

559
01:03:15,321 --> 01:03:17,563
[SPEAKER_05]: So see how people feel about that as well.

560
01:03:20,065 --> 01:03:29,193
[SPEAKER_02]: Would it make sense to entertain a motion to recommend increasing the size of the OPM selection committee from three to five to the full committee?

561
01:03:30,587 --> 01:03:38,952
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that will give us sort of an opening for the committee to think about that and make those appointments.

562
01:03:42,334 --> 01:03:47,237
[SPEAKER_06]: I will make that motion of increasing the committee from 2 to 5.

563
01:03:47,577 --> 01:03:50,919
[SPEAKER_06]: From 3 to 5, 3 to 5.

564
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:52,100
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry my apologies.

565
01:03:52,540 --> 01:03:55,261
[SPEAKER_02]: So motion by doctor Cushing seconded by 2nd.

566
01:03:55,281 --> 01:03:56,122
[SPEAKER_06]: And then.

567
01:04:00,505 --> 01:04:21,778
[SPEAKER_02]: roll call jenny graham yes dr cushing yes um aaron lapati yes green the affirmative zero on the negative motion passes so we'll bring that back to the committee to try to increase the party here just a little bit um and um

568
01:04:24,102 --> 01:04:33,664
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the other question is, is there a motion to bring this adjusted RFS to the full committee for input?

569
01:04:36,864 --> 01:04:37,524
[SPEAKER_05]: A motion for that.

570
01:04:39,125 --> 01:04:39,805
[SPEAKER_04]: I will second that.

571
01:04:40,465 --> 01:04:43,165
[SPEAKER_02]: By Aaron, seconded by Dr. Cushing.

572
01:04:44,826 --> 01:04:45,886
[SPEAKER_02]: Jenny Graham, yes.

573
01:04:46,626 --> 01:04:47,606
[SPEAKER_02]: Aaron Olapade.

574
01:04:48,586 --> 01:04:48,886
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

575
01:04:49,927 --> 01:04:50,747
[SPEAKER_02]: And Dr. Cushing.

576
01:04:51,847 --> 01:04:52,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

577
01:04:53,463 --> 01:04:55,706
[SPEAKER_02]: 3 in the affirmative, 0 negative, motion passes.

578
01:04:55,726 --> 01:04:58,489
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

579
01:04:59,590 --> 01:05:05,157
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if I'm going to flip back quickly to our agenda.

580
01:05:09,105 --> 01:05:22,713
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, we have talked about the key elements of module 2. we have reviewed and edited the drafted RFS, and we have also discussed the vetting and selection process during our review.

581
01:05:23,034 --> 01:05:25,095
[SPEAKER_02]: So the only thing left to do is adjourn.

582
01:05:26,215 --> 01:05:27,276
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a motion to adjourn?

583
01:05:29,517 --> 01:05:30,318
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to adjourn.

584
01:05:30,918 --> 01:05:31,479
[SPEAKER_06]: I will second.

585
01:05:32,079 --> 01:05:35,181
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion to adjourn by Aaron, seconded by Dr. Cushing.

586
01:05:35,201 --> 01:05:36,822
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Aaron?

587
01:05:38,443 --> 01:05:38,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

588
01:05:39,489 --> 01:05:39,931
[SPEAKER_02]: Peter?

589
01:05:40,614 --> 01:05:40,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_02]: 3 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative.
