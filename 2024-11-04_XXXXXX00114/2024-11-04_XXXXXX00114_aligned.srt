And this is the Medford Bites podcast.

6
00:00:21,615 --> 00:00:28,496
Every two weeks, we chew on the issues facing Medford and deliver bites of information about the city by lifting the expertise of our guests.

7
00:00:29,357 --> 00:00:32,397
Join us in discussion about what you hope for the future of Medford.

8
00:00:32,817 --> 00:00:34,898
And as always, tell us where you like to eat.

9
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,441
All right, thank you both for being here with me today.

10
00:00:39,461 --> 00:00:41,941
We could start just by introducing yourselves.

11
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:45,242
So if you could say your name, pronouns, and who you are.

12
00:00:46,843 --> 00:00:48,423
Hello, thank you for having us.

13
00:00:48,443 --> 00:00:49,643
We're very happy to be here.

14
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:52,284
My name is Mikayla Paquette.

15
00:00:53,664 --> 00:00:56,285
I go by the she, her series.

16
00:00:57,685 --> 00:00:59,486
And your other questions, that's bad, I forgot.

17
00:01:00,026 --> 00:01:03,067
Yeah, just for the purpose of the podcast, who are you today?

18
00:01:04,487 --> 00:01:12,291
Um, I'm currently a senior playing basketball at Tufts University and studying sociology and civic studies.

19
00:01:13,352 --> 00:01:27,079
And then I'm also the founder of Community Hoops, a nonprofit organization, working to empower the next generation of basketball players through skill development and community building and engagement.

20
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:28,600
Thank you.

21
00:01:31,412 --> 00:01:33,234
Yeah, my name is Callie O'Brien.

22
00:01:33,254 --> 00:01:37,278
I am a master's student at Tufts University.

23
00:01:37,298 --> 00:01:41,582
I'm a point guard and I'm currently getting my master's in biology.

24
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:47,828
And I help make out as a skill trainer and coach here at Community Hoops.

25
00:01:49,455 --> 00:01:49,836
Thank you.

26
00:01:49,856 --> 00:01:50,476
Yeah, thank you.

27
00:01:50,617 --> 00:01:53,680
So we were hoping to talk mostly about community hoops today.

28
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,444
And this program that you both are working for.

29
00:01:58,026 --> 00:02:05,475
Before we do that, though, we'll ask you the same question that we ask everyone on the podcast, which is what is your favorite place to eat in Medford?

30
00:02:05,516 --> 00:02:06,537
And what do you like to eat there?

31
00:02:06,557 --> 00:02:08,800
Good question.

32
00:02:10,521 --> 00:02:11,642
Is Semolina in Medford?

33
00:02:11,863 --> 00:02:13,324
I was just about to ask that.

34
00:02:14,345 --> 00:02:14,926
It is, yes.

35
00:02:15,366 --> 00:02:17,148
Yeah, then that's got to be Semolina.

36
00:02:18,009 --> 00:02:20,211
The vodka pizza from Semolina.

37
00:02:20,271 --> 00:02:21,553
That's what I get every time.

38
00:02:22,294 --> 00:02:23,875
And the vodka pasta is my favorite.

39
00:02:26,538 --> 00:02:31,341
Yeah, it's been a while since I've been there, but that's a great place to be.

40
00:02:31,821 --> 00:02:39,286
So Community Hoops, we met each other briefly at Oktoberfest a couple weeks ago, and you guys were there kind of promoting your work with Community Hoops.

41
00:02:39,306 --> 00:02:45,550
So I don't know if you can share what Community Hoops is, kind of what you want people in Medford to understand about your work.

42
00:02:46,883 --> 00:02:49,246
Yeah, I can start cow.

43
00:02:49,266 --> 00:02:53,271
So community hoops is something that I started last March.

44
00:02:54,172 --> 00:03:02,922
Like I said before, I'm a civic studies and sociology major so a lot of what I do, like on the whole academic side is very civically focused.

45
00:03:03,722 --> 00:03:18,865
And then obviously playing collegiate basketball I realized that, you know, with this position that I have, I'm able to bring people together and I also you know I'm a true believer in the strength and, you know, the strength of basketball and the power of it.

46
00:03:20,046 --> 00:03:26,247
So last March, I started, and it's actually a almost like a two site program.

47
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:35,527
So it's a we're working in the medford and some rural area i'm from boston so it's kind of this local level.

48
00:03:36,908 --> 00:03:38,589
skill development camps.

49
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:42,513
I was working at Mystic Learning Center over the summer.

50
00:03:43,433 --> 00:03:49,679
And then the other half of it is over in South Africa, which I also lived over there for a little bit.

51
00:03:51,180 --> 00:04:06,192
In South Africa, there's three different sites throughout Johannesburg, and we're working with three different community organizations that I've had ties with, you know, for most of my life, and kind of bringing basketball to them and bringing another way of community engagement.

52
00:04:07,698 --> 00:04:12,663
In South Africa they're dealing with a lot of youth unemployment and domestic abuse and violence.

53
00:04:13,684 --> 00:04:17,627
And so, sports has been one of those ways that they're trying to push kids into a.

54
00:04:19,702 --> 00:04:20,623
a safe environment.

55
00:04:21,464 --> 00:04:33,093
And so kind of bringing basketball bringing that community, building sense of identity and expression to these kids has been something that just feels like I'm pulled towards.

56
00:04:34,134 --> 00:04:40,379
And so those are kind of like the two prongs of it, and we're operating, you know, we'll be on the ground in South Africa this summer.

57
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:50,284
But right now, Callie, you know, is basically leading our Sunday camps, which we run at Tufts every Sunday.

58
00:04:50,304 --> 00:04:53,826
And yeah, Callie, you can talk a little bit more about that.

59
00:04:55,126 --> 00:05:05,711
Yeah, I think Mick and I have both been lucky enough to, when we were younger, be trained kind of in one-on-one sessions and clinics.

60
00:05:05,911 --> 00:05:09,153
And it's something we both enjoyed, and we kind of wanted to bring

61
00:05:09,997 --> 00:05:13,319
to the athletes and kids around us.

62
00:05:14,739 --> 00:05:31,248
So Sundays are really a time to obviously focus on skill development and working on our basketball skills, but we also really try to emphasize being a great teammate and communicating and things like that that

63
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:35,186
are great skills to have off of the court too and in life.

64
00:05:35,286 --> 00:05:40,111
So we try to get better at basketball, but also get better in a lot of other ways.

65
00:05:41,953 --> 00:05:45,337
So you're saying that, so there's a clinic that happens on Sundays.

66
00:05:45,357 --> 00:05:51,203
So how would like residents of Medford, how would we get involved with like either parts of your program?

67
00:05:52,742 --> 00:05:55,304
Yeah, so we send out a link each week.

68
00:05:56,905 --> 00:06:03,269
We have kind of like an e list right now that has a refreshed sign up for Sunday clinics.

69
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:10,994
And that's also available on our community hoop social media on Instagram as well.

70
00:06:12,335 --> 00:06:14,337
And then there's also another link that

71
00:06:15,506 --> 00:06:28,169
has some more information about the South Africa side of the program and ways to kind of get involved that way, whether it's donating time, money, or wisdom and kind of whatever it may look like.

72
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:35,731
But yeah, so we're mainly running off of the Instagram until we get our website up and running.

73
00:06:36,872 --> 00:06:41,473
But right now that's kind of where you can go to access all of our info and ways to get involved.

74
00:06:42,552 --> 00:06:46,695
And we can make sure to put that information in our show notes so people can access it more easily.

75
00:06:46,715 --> 00:06:47,675
Yeah.

76
00:06:48,596 --> 00:07:03,886
And so, you know, we were chatting a little bit before we started recording and I was kind of describing how the podcast, you know, tries to focus on kind of equity and inclusivity in the city of Medford and how we can sort of be doing a better job of that.

77
00:07:03,906 --> 00:07:09,330
And I, it feels like your work is very much focused on that type of theme.

78
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:10,411
I wonder kind of if,

79
00:07:11,011 --> 00:07:15,657
If you thought kind of longer term what your hope would be in terms of an impact on the city.

80
00:07:15,677 --> 00:07:24,989
I think, for me, being from this area, it's very.

81
00:07:28,544 --> 00:07:36,853
I don't know, I've been in a constant kind of state of reflection, just so proud of Boston and, you know, the surrounding neighborhoods and cities.

82
00:07:38,234 --> 00:07:49,546
And then now being here in Medford for like four years, you know, it becomes to like, you know, more like home and like, especially such important years of my life spent here.

83
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:56,133
And I think at the end of the day, it's all about this opportunity of basketball that brought me here.

84
00:07:57,335 --> 00:08:03,522
And I think that just kind of shows that for me, things that you're passionate about things that make you happy.

85
00:08:04,232 --> 00:08:06,533
like to step into those, to lean into that.

86
00:08:06,633 --> 00:08:09,275
And it kind of can allow you to bring that to other people.

87
00:08:10,376 --> 00:08:15,719
So I think that's kind of my goal is just to continue to share the power of basketball, the power of community.

88
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:29,887
And it's really nice to be able to be selfish a little bit and share it with this, you know, small area, but also to expand it globally as well, because, you know, we're all a part of, you know, one community at the end of the day, and we're all playing the same game.

89
00:08:32,177 --> 00:08:35,999
just kind of thinking about it, you know, up close to home and also like far away too.

90
00:08:36,019 --> 00:08:37,140
Yeah.

91
00:08:39,742 --> 00:08:40,882
Would you add anything to that Kelly?

92
00:08:42,303 --> 00:08:44,024
Yeah, I think that covers a lot.

93
00:08:44,084 --> 00:08:48,467
I feel like access is an important thing to the both of us.

94
00:08:48,547 --> 00:08:56,452
And I think being from New York, I know a lot of times for me to participate in something like this, you kind of

95
00:08:57,013 --> 00:09:04,136
had to be part of a travel team or a certain school or have a certain level of skill and experience.

96
00:09:04,196 --> 00:09:11,559
And that's something that we kind of wanted to reduce the barriers for in doing this.

97
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:14,240
Any skill level is welcome.

98
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:18,641
You don't have to be on an AU team or a school team.

99
00:09:18,781 --> 00:09:22,903
And we know how important basketball is to us and how much it teaches you.

100
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:25,204
That really has nothing to do with basketball at all.

101
00:09:26,109 --> 00:09:30,631
We wanted those things to kind of be accessible to whoever is interested.

102
00:09:32,207 --> 00:09:38,530
Yeah, I remember being like a kid and being really into sports and like role models are really important.

103
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:41,551
Like if you have, and we have a great resource of Tufts and Medford, right?

104
00:09:41,591 --> 00:09:49,835
And so being able to know like, Oh, like to learn from college, like a college athlete would, would have been like really cool as a kid, as a kid.

105
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:56,558
So I'm sure that it's, it's a really cool experience for like the youth in the area to get that, to get that opportunity.

106
00:09:57,378 --> 00:10:01,360
Is there an age, like an age range or age, like restriction for the clinics?

107
00:10:02,917 --> 00:10:12,079
So we say like eight to 13, but we've had sometimes high school kids, we've had like six-year-olds sometimes.

108
00:10:12,119 --> 00:10:15,380
When we had camp, there was like a four and five-year-old.

109
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:25,183
So we're really, you know, if you're willing to pick up a basketball and, you know, play with us and work hard, it doesn't really matter what age you are.

110
00:10:27,143 --> 00:10:33,608
I want to start some adult clinics, too, at some point, but that that will will will unfold later.

111
00:10:33,628 --> 00:10:44,555
And, you know, we were saying kind of having role models in the community is important and you're you both are entering your final season for the Tufts basketball team.

112
00:10:44,635 --> 00:10:45,696
All right.

113
00:10:46,156 --> 00:10:47,437
And when does that season start?

114
00:10:48,918 --> 00:10:50,259
We start practice on Tuesday.

115
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:53,541
And so where can we come to watch you guys play?

116
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:58,853
Cousins, we have a lot of home games this season actually, especially in the beginning.

117
00:10:58,873 --> 00:11:02,595
I think we start like mid November with games.

118
00:11:02,755 --> 00:11:05,477
So yeah, come out and watch it.

119
00:11:05,497 --> 00:11:07,338
It should be a fun, it should be a fun year.

120
00:11:08,219 --> 00:11:08,519
Yeah.

121
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,141
We try and be a fun team to watch.

122
00:11:11,741 --> 00:11:14,243
So it should be exciting.

123
00:11:15,104 --> 00:11:18,666
We've got a lot of prove this year, so it's always going to be, it's always going to be fun.

124
00:11:18,686 --> 00:11:18,786
Great.

125
00:11:20,287 --> 00:11:21,468
And one other question.

126
00:11:23,863 --> 00:11:27,664
Who are you hoping to win the WNBA finals?

127
00:11:27,684 --> 00:11:28,785
Oh, that's a crazy question.

128
00:11:28,805 --> 00:11:32,726
Don't get us started on this because we're on three different sides of the spectrum.

129
00:11:32,766 --> 00:11:33,146
Yeah.

130
00:11:33,386 --> 00:11:34,687
We're in some beef right now.

131
00:11:34,707 --> 00:11:37,948
Um, I'm a huge Nafisa Collier fan.

132
00:11:38,568 --> 00:11:41,409
So I, and Maya Moore is my favorite player of all time.

133
00:11:41,429 --> 00:11:47,711
So I want the Lynx to win, but Callie is, I'm from New York city, so I'm rooting for the Liberty.

134
00:11:48,251 --> 00:11:50,052
I also love Sabrina.

135
00:11:50,072 --> 00:11:50,792
Yeah.

136
00:11:51,392 --> 00:11:55,413
And after that shot the other day, I'm sorry, Mick, but I think it's going to be over tonight.

137
00:11:55,433 --> 00:11:56,753
That's all right.

138
00:11:57,213 --> 00:11:57,813
I have hope.

139
00:11:58,053 --> 00:11:58,654
I have hope.

140
00:11:58,714 --> 00:12:00,414
So that's all that matters, hope and faith.

141
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:09,436
Yeah, and I do wonder about how many Boston fans or Connecticut Sun fans are hoping the Lynx win just because they beat out the Suns.

142
00:12:09,456 --> 00:12:11,136
But yeah, it'll be interesting to see.

143
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:13,437
By the time this comes out, we will know the answer.

144
00:12:13,477 --> 00:12:18,278
But yeah, is there anything else that you guys want to plug here or let us know about?

145
00:12:20,037 --> 00:12:30,309
Well, we just appreciate your time and hope that, you know, we can see some of y'all at games and at our clinics and maybe in South Africa.

146
00:12:30,409 --> 00:12:32,651
So, but thank you for having us.

147
00:12:32,911 --> 00:12:33,372
For sure.

148
00:12:33,772 --> 00:12:34,013
Yeah.

149
00:12:34,033 --> 00:12:34,974
Thank you both for being here.

150
00:12:37,336 --> 00:12:37,757
Anytime.

151
00:12:45,538 --> 00:12:47,479
Thanks so much for listening to today's episode.

152
00:12:47,959 --> 00:12:52,640
