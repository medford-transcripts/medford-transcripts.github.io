 Alicia Hunt，规划、发展和可持续发展总监。
 今晚我和你在一起。
 正如所有理事会成员和大多数公众所知，梅德福广场已有数十年的研究、计划和建议。
 几年前，我们发布了一份 RFP。
 我们实际上聘请了一位顾问来撰写 RFP。
 我们发起了重新开发这里停车场的征求建议书，目标是开发住房和复制我们继续需要的停车场，同时也在梅德福广场增加住房和一些额外的商业空间，并活跃广场的这一端，将酒店与我们活跃的企业联系起来。
 这涉及更多更好地利用我们的公共停车位。
 我们之前曾在委员会审查 RFP 回复时与您交谈过。
 我要说出委员会成员的名字。
 恐怕我错了，不过那个委员会里有董事会主席熊、商会会长，还有其士剧院的代表。
 委员蒂姆·麦吉文 (Tim McGiven) 和幕僚长尼娜·纳扎里安 (Nina Nazarian) 都是该委员会的成员。
 布里安娜市长在场，我本人和我们的经济发展总监也在场。
 为了分析这些提案，我们收到了两个提案。
 我们推荐这个委员会
 一是本委员会的提案之一，Transom，Peter Speleos 是该公司的董事。
 Peter Speleos 今天下午和我们在一起。
 我们已与他们进行谈判，以获得与他签订的土地开发协议文本的细节。
 我们需要这个机构在某个时候投票来释放这个财产。
 从技术上讲，必须对剩余财产进行投票才能实现这一目标。
 让我明确一点：我们不会出售该房产。
 该计划是99年的租约。
 这段时间足以让开发商获得该房产的融资，就像他购买了该房产一样。
 在我看来，将财产交给城市作为城市来管理和控制，公司来来去去，但城市是永恒的。
 因此，我们仍将长期保留该房产的所有权，但将其长期租赁给 Transom Real Estate。
 Peter Speleos 今天下午在这里与大家分享我们的计划以及他对该房产的计划，同时我们正在推进谈判以为此签署一份法律文件。
 在接下来几周、两个月的某个时候，我们将需要这个机构就这一财产和剩余财产进行投票。
 所以我们想向大家通报这一情况，同时与公众分享这一信息，以便每个人都知道事情的发展方向。
 我们仍处于谈判的早期阶段，可以进行调整，但有一个提议。
 该提案是两栋建筑物和一个停车场。
 我想我会将演示文稿的其余部分留给 Peter，因为它提供的视觉资源将极大地帮助理解该提案。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/ObzNxwbGKmg&t=3374.207s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: 晚安。
 你能听清楚我说话吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/ObzNxwbGKmg&t=3380.289s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 啊，现在我的麦克风打开了。
 抱歉，彼得，请稍等。
 一切都好。
 在承认这一点之前，我只想感谢亨特导演。
 我只是想指出，市长和我是委员会中无投票权的成员，我有一个问题。
 我们必须进行投票才能产生剩余商品。
 我想我们 100% 确定您需要获得董事会多少批准？
 对剩余财产进行投票。
 租赁合同也经过投票了吗？
 还有分区考虑吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/ObzNxwbGKmg&t=3413.153s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: 因此，根据梅德福目前的分区情况，要单独考虑它们，该提案需要进行许多修改。
 这是这座城市的初衷
 我们一直在讨论总体的重新分区，并且普遍认为我们需要对梅德福广场进行重新分区。
 我们希望当我们重新规划梅德福广场时，我个人希望这会在今年冬天发生，这样可以让这些建筑得到妥善的处理。
 否则，分区上诉委员会将允许较小的差异。
 但总的来说，一般来说，它们将在之前提出的分区中被允许。
 我们需要协商、更改或寻求变更一些小细节。
 所以这是一回事。
 我们目前正在将其作为一个单独的主题进行讨论。
 这是整个广场的分区，而不仅仅是这三个地块。
 如果有必要，我可以提出一项动议，即仅将这三个地块作为规划开发区的提案，但这不是目前的计划。
 目前的计划是重新规划梅德福广场
 总的来说，使这个项目成为一个可行的项目。
 就是这样。
 我仍在寻求我们的法律顾问澄清我们是否需要市议会批准 99 年的租约，因为如果是出售，市议会唯一的投票实际上就是对剩余财产的投票。
 因此，如果是直接出售，该委员会将投票认定这是剩余财产，然后市政府可以出售该财产。
 因为是99年的租约
 而议长只能缔结一项为期三年的协议，我们仍在澄清是否真的需要授权才能对其进行投票。
 需要明确的是，我今晚不要求任何投票，但我们希望在你们面前提供信息，以便我们有时间思考，在我们来投票之前澄清任何问题。
 但第三个可能是投票支持剩余财产。
 这确实是必要的。
 事实上，这种情况经常发生在土地处置项目和重建项目中，这些项目甚至在房产提交征求建议书之前就已进行。
 通常，征求建议书会说，市政府已投票决定该房产是剩余的，并将其提供给征求建议书。
 不是梅德福，梅德福已经超过 15 年没有出售或改造过这样的房产了。
 我们那段时期的记录有点粗略，但他们似乎是等到征求建议书后才投票。
 许多、大多数社区基于大规模开发，在发布 RFP 之前进行投票。
 所以仅供参考。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/ObzNxwbGKmg&t=3589.072s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 谢谢。
 在将电话转给彼得·斯佩利奥斯之前，我们对亨特总监有什么问题吗？
 我有一个问题，弗莱明议员。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/ObzNxwbGKmg&t=3601.481s">[Matt Leming]</a>: 这是一个小程序问题。
 这次会议我可能也会迟到一点，但无论如何我很好奇。
 我们目前有一项提案，对社区发展委员会附属于西梅德福广场的梅德福广场进行重新分区。
 我认为这只是一种那里。
 假设一下，市议会是否有权与中央商务区举行联合公开听证会，然后在会议期间将西梅德福广场与梅德福广场提案分开，然后将其转发回市议会，以便在合同获得批准并且我们继续重新分区过程的情况下加快这一进程？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/ObzNxwbGKmg&t=3644.801s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: 是的，因此分开考虑两者，市议会和社区发展委员会可能会选择举行联合公开听证会以使这成为可能。
 举行听证会并选择分开，市议会可以选择将两者分开，批准一个，而将另一个保留在桌面上。
 我们还与法律部门合作，了解推进目前正在讨论的分区措施的最佳、最干净的流程。
 例如，如果其中一些建议被撤回，然后稍后重新提交，或者说实话，如果我们应该推进与西梅德福分开的梅德福广场的现有提案，那将是最快的路线，因为事实上，它仍然是在那里举行的合法公开听证会。
 CD董事会将其推迟到某个日期。
 我认为那个日期是在一月份。
 我认为 CD 委员会投票并希望将其保持足够远，这样就不会成为问题。
 由于法定通知截止日期，我们需要两周时间在报纸上举行公开听证会。
 这有助于设定事情何时发生的预期，但我们可以在一月份那个安全的日期重新开始。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/ObzNxwbGKmg&t=3729.064s">[Matt Leming]</a>: 在联合公开听证会上，市议会是否有权作为一个整体投票将这些问题分开，然后在同一次公开听证会上单独考虑？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/ObzNxwbGKmg&t=3742.504s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: 好的，通常情况下 CD 委员会会向市议会提出建议。
 这是我们对此事的建议，我们建议您削减它们。
 市议会将投票罢免它们，然后只考虑市议会。
 至于梅德福广场部分，我认为为了简单起见，我会在会议开始时说，这就是目的，我只是在真正考虑该部分。
 然后投票将作为将此事提交给他们的一部分。
 据我从顾问那里了解到的情况，市议会和市议会就分区问题举行联合公开听证会的情况并不少见。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/ObzNxwbGKmg&t=3791.819s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 谢谢。
 谢谢。
 由于我没有看到更多问题，我将把发言权交给彼得。
 Peter，我知道您有一个演示文稿，您应该能够在 Zoom 上分享并随身携带。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/ObzNxwbGKmg&t=3804.92s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: 出色的。
 主席先生，非常感谢您。
 董事会成员们，我只是想确保你们能清楚地听到我的声音。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/ObzNxwbGKmg&t=3811.384s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 是的，我们可以。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/ObzNxwbGKmg&t=3812.505s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: 太好了，谢谢。
 我很高兴这么快就来到这里。
 我知道这座城市已经讨论这个问题很长时间了，你们也已经为此工作了很长时间，但实际上是在发展这种类型方面
 整体发展以及理念和愿景。
 现在还处于早期阶段，我认为这真的很棒，值得你们所有人称赞，这次对话的发生是为了确保人们意识到这一点，并且我们有最好的机会提供意见和协作。
 所以我要分享我的屏幕。
 我将做一个相对快速的演示，欢迎提问，但我真的很想将对话带到董事会想要的地方。
 请耐心听我说一下。
 等一下。
 你应该能够看到我的屏幕。
 我只是想确认您可以看到我的屏幕，好吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/ObzNxwbGKmg&t=3871.435s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 我们可以看到您的屏幕。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/ObzNxwbGKmg&t=3872.956s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  Great.
 I'm going to put it in full screen mode to make it even better.
 Good evening, everyone.
 I'm Peter Spellios with Transom Real Estate.
 I'll talk a little bit at the end about Transom, but we're a Boston-based company.
 All the principals live and work here.
 We are Boston-centric.
 All of our projects are, if not a tea ride, a short car ride.
 for us all.
 I wanted to start by focusing really quickly on the team and in particular one, two, but one in particular member of our team.
 When we saw this RFP, we really, the RFP was really very well done in putting forth a vision.
 and making clear to anyone, whether or not you've been in Medford Square once or you've been in Medford Square a million times, that these are really important parcels.
 Parcels that, frankly, are important from every direction and every perspective, whether or not you're a resident living there, whether you're a business there, or you're walking through, you're driving through, no matter which direction you're coming from.
 And so we brought on PCA as the project architect.
 PCA may not be a firm that you folks know by name or is a household name, but what's really important is PCA is the architect and really the design brainchild behind a lot of very successful dynamic mixed-use projects, many of which you would know about, Legacy Place in Dedham, Chestnut Hill, Linfield Market.
 to name a few.
 We thought it was really important to bring someone who not only could do a lovely job designing a residential project, but really focus on the street level, right, that first 30 feet of a building, the one that everybody that passes by experiences, the one that adds life and vibrancy to any neighborhood.
 So we're excited that they're part of the team.
 Another team member is Beyond Walls.
 Some of you may be aware of Beyond Walls, which is a nonprofit, which is really specialized in public art, murals.
 If you've been to the city of Lynn, if you've been any number of cities in and around Boston now, you're familiar with these really incredible
 murals and art installations that Beyond Walls has done, working with local communities, working with local schools, working with other nonprofits to really advance art and interest, and I'll talk a little bit more about them briefly.
 I had already mentioned, excuse me, PCA.
 The most recent dynamic mixed-use village is actually just north of our border in Salem, New Hampshire by PCA, Tuscan Village.
 But as I mentioned, PCA was instrumental with Market Street, Linfield, the street in Chestnut Hill, and legacy place, Dedham.
 As you all know, these are the three parking lots for which the RFP was put out for.
 Again, remarkably dynamic parcels given that they are just asphalt gardens for the most part currently, but really important parcels.
 The RFP that went out was really clear about
 several things.
 One being, I'm going to just deal with the least interesting part, but very important part, parking, right?
 There's a lot of parking that's on these parcels today.
 There's a lot of demand for parking, especially for City Hall, especially for the Senior Center and some of the neighbors.
 So making sure that whatever plan happened
 dealt with the realities of parking was number one.
 Number two, and again these are not nor does our priority, number two was a desire to bring people downtown, to bring people living here, to build housing downtown and have a core focus on housing.
 Third,
 putting some street front retail here with particular interest in a grocer and having an urban grocer or a downtown grocer added to the list of other retail opportunities in Medford was a really important element.
 And then last, and again, the list goes on, but I'm just highlighting just a couple on the top, is really connectivity.
 coming up with a project that doesn't have a front or a back, doesn't have a left or a right, but really is a project that speaks to its neighbors from all sides, that communicates with every resident, every business, and really hopefully is done in a way that sets the table for other things to happen down the road in Medford Square.
 You folks have, as Alicia mentioned earlier, done a significant amount of planning and Medford really has, I think, an envy of a lot of roadmap of how to do these type of things.
 And so when we were making our proposal to the city, we reviewed all these plans, the comprehensive plan,
 the interest in public art, resiliency and sustainability, to make sure that we were addressing things that we knew by virtue of these plans and other initiatives, that we were addressing the things that were important to you all and to the city.
 This screen here puts forth some metrics of what the project could look like.
 I say could look like because we've responded to an RFP.
 We're grateful and very enthusiastic about continuing this conversation.
 And this is what our original thoughts from the RFP looked like in just numbers.
 This will evolve, this will change, this will be fluid based on feedback from you all, from stakeholders in the city.
 And so I want this to be seen as where we are now, understanding that this is very early on in the process.
 So we think appropriately in density wise, approximately 300 residential units here, 20% of which would be affordable units.
 which we think is a really important part to make sure that you do have the mix of income stratification in your housing stock.
 I mentioned the local grocer.
 We are proposing approximately 15,000 square foot grocer.
 on one of the parcels.
 Importantly, residential, and I'm happy to talk more as the Council would like to, residential is something that you can build almost always if the financing markets are available.
 But retail, especially grocery stores, you really are subject to the market.
 Where is the market at any given time?
 I'm excited because we're, you are doing this RFP.
 We are collectively collaborating on this RFP at a point in time where the grocery market, the urban grocers are increasing in numbers.
 And this is a market where they're looking for growth.
 And so I think as though we have an opportunity here, not just to talk about a grocery store, but really to put a dynamic grocer downtown that I think is really important.
 parking.
 I'll talk a little bit more about parking again in a minute here, but we are providing ample parking for City Hall and for visitors to City Hall and for City Hall business and staff.
 And we are also providing public parking for the senior center.
 Very early on, the mayor and staff have been very clear about the importance of making sure that this project be a benefit to the Council on Aging.
 I met with the executive director recently of the Council on Aging to just start and make sure we had names and faces with each other to make sure that we are
 having a good dialogue and that she felt comfortable reaching out to me and as this progresses, knowing that we're going to be in touch to figure out how to create that connectivity.
 The grocery store is currently designed right across the street from the Council on Aging, which we also think is really important as an amenity as well.
 I mentioned beyond walls and public art.
 Look, I just fundamentally in my core believe that there can't be fronts or backs to these buildings.
 And while the people that live in the building may not see the buildings, you know, if you will.
 and care as much about the exterior as they do the interior, the reality is 99.9% of the world sees it from the outside.
 And so these buildings themselves are pieces of sculpture, but we can do it in a way to make the first 30 feet for sure very vibrant, very interesting to not only make people wanna be there and feel safe, but also to attract others and help other existing businesses in Medford Square prosper.
 And then the last thing, which I guess two quick things here is resiliency we'll talk about and sustainability.
 You folks are champions on this topic.
 This project will be passive house, which is a really important and terrific goal.
 It will be all electric.
 And then lastly here is green spaces and connectivity.
 I think it's really important to just further accentuate what I was talking about with connectivity.
 We looked at this from every direction, pedestrian, whether you're on foot, scooter, car, in the back seat of a car, front seat of a car, to understand really
 how to create the connectivity, how to bring people from one place to another, how to help people navigate through signage and nonverbal markers to the river, which is only getting better and better with the trail network.
 And so how do we make them easier to get to City Hall?
 How do we make it safer and more convenient for seniors to get to the Council on Aging?
 In doing that, we look at a bunch of core areas.
 So this is a first take, if you will, about those same three parking lots we were talking about before.
 On the upper right-hand side is where we're suggesting the parking garage go up against I-93.
 That will have both surface parking and a parking lot.
 As you may recall, the Hyatt has the benefit of a easement with the city to allow parking on a portion of that for the hotel.
 And so we will certainly be making accommodations for that and making sure we don't interfere with those rights for the Hyatt Hotel there.
 And then as we move down plan south, if you will, to the screen, you see the two residential buildings, one on lot B and one on lot A.
 Lot B being the larger of the two residential buildings that also has some ground floor retail and public outdoor space and courtyards.
 And then Lot A being the one right across the street from the Council Aging, which is where the grocery store would most likely be located.
 Showing this to really show the key is how do you weave these together, right?
 So they can become a linear park.
 They can become something both through verbal and nonverbal cues.
 Really set this table for Medford Square and hopefully in a way that does a couple of things.
 One, creates connectivity to the rest of Medford Square.
 Two, sets a standard, hopefully, to get success and to help others increase traffic volume for business, foot traffic for business, so that the businesses that are there now and future businesses will thrive in these locations.
 So again, different techniques that will do it different of these spaces here, whether it's roadway improvements in terms of sidewalk improvements in terms of race crosswalks.
 There are so many tools available in the toolbox for us to partner with the city on both on these parcels and for the city to look at for some of its adjacent streets as well as a project.
 And again, I've already mentioned the retail, so I won't spend much time here.
 We really think as though we have an opportunity, a window here because the grocery market, the urban grocery market has been growing and they're in a growth mode right now.
 And so we think we're in a good position to be able to execute on that, which is very exciting.
 And then I've already mentioned Beyond Walls.
 I encourage you, if you ever have a Saturday that you want to go to Lynn, do a mural tour in the city of Lynn.
 It is the most remarkable way to see a city, is by looking up the entire time at the buildings.
 But really excited that they agreed to partner with us and to bring that energy and their collaboration with the community here.
 I mentioned parking before.
 Preliminarily, this project provides upwards to 600 parking spaces, which will include 100 parking spaces dedicated just for staff and visitors to City Hall at no cost, and then also includes parking that's dispersed throughout the project.
 Again, the goal is not to start with asphalt gardens and finish with asphalt gardens, but again, do it in a way that the parking kind of fades away.
 It's convenient, it's there, but it's no longer the focal point.
 And most especially, as I mentioned before, is really working with the city, working with the Council on Aging on how to create better connectivity, how to create more convenient parking and safer access and more comfortable access to the Council on Aging.
 I already mentioned the sustainability passive house construction.
 We're excited to roll up our sleeves and have the design team go to work on this.
 These are images.
 They're just images.
 They're not necessarily images of what is going to end up in Medford Square, but just to kind of give a sense of the connectivity and the place that can be built and the vibrancy.
 Again,
 The first 20 feet, 25 feet of a building is the one that most people experience.
 We want to make sure that on all sides and all ways, these are communicating to all the neighbors around us.
 This is if you're just to the left of City Hall, looking to the rear of City Hall on the left-hand side, potentially is where the parking garage would be up against 93.
 And you can see the Hyatt in the rear.
 Again, ideas right and I'm really excited that this is the start of conversation and really a lot of people have reached out and and we're excited about it.
 And then, lastly, I'm just going to end with kind of schedule schedule is a very fluid thing as Alicia kind of intimated about.
 We're having really good conversations about the formalizing the legal documentation.
 Not very interesting legal documentation, but interesting because it's going to unleash, I think, a flurry of activity that we can take these ideas and we can take the things that we're hearing from the city, that we're hearing from you, that we're hearing from the neighbors, and bring it to life so that we can have more community conversations and we can go through a permitting process with the city.
 We are aware of the draft zoning that was out for Medford Square.
 We did comment to staff.
 We actually think it's in really good shape.
 We did have some comments that we shared.
 We're excited to roll up our sleeves and work with the council and staff to see that through and happy to talk about it.
 Um, and then construction is roughly, um, you know, 24 months.
 Um, if again, I think there's going to be some sequencing because we're going to be very careful about not displacing everything at once and making sure there's always parking and making sure that we're doing things.
 So we'll have to work out the details of how to sequence things and make sure everything's done appropriately to minimize disruption, but also accelerate, uh, completion.
 Um, so that's also something we'll be having conversation with the city about.
 And then very last is Transom.
 I leave them last because I think that's us and we're important because we see ourselves as now a partner with you all.
 And I really am really proud of what we focus on at Transom.
 It really is.
 We, I think, do a great job for the residents and people that are in our building and use our building, but I think we do an even better job for the neighborhoods and the communities.
 I tell everybody that has ever worked with Transom and people that allow me to bend their ear is developers make a mistake and they act like it's their last project they're doing in a community.
 And I think development companies, if they really wanted to do good for themselves, they would treat every project like it's their first.
 project in a community, not their last.
 And because we are all local, because we are here, my wife and I spent our first years of marriage living on Humav in Medford.
 We care deeply about it.
 We want to leave significant pieces of architecture in communities here.
 And we think we've been successful and the communities in which we've been in our communities that we would be welcomed in again and again.
 And so with that,
 I'm gonna stop sharing.
 I'm happy to go back to any screen or to whatever you folks wanna take the conversation.
 So thank you, Mr. President.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/ObzNxwbGKmg&t=4979.705s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 谢谢你，佩德罗。
 好的，董事会成员现在对彼得有任何关于演示或项目的问题吗？
 看来还有工作要做，我去跟曾议员谈谈吧。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/ObzNxwbGKmg&t=4999.222s">[Justin Tseng]</a>: 谢谢你，佩德罗。
 我只是想感谢您早些时候与董事会几位成员的会面。
 我知道我们在这次演讲之前谈过。
 当我们谈话时，我想我们讨论了合法停车的运作方式。
 我们怎样才能在运营这个项目的同时将土地归城市所有呢？
 我很好奇在我们对此法案进行投票之前、在该法案生效之前是否还需要解决任何其他类似的法律细节。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/ObzNxwbGKmg&t=5043.384s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: 主席先生，您愿意我谈谈这个吗？
 是的，继续吧。
 出色地。
 或者除非你想要城里的人……不，我想，议员，谢谢。
 我思考并享受这次谈话。
 我认为艾丽西亚很好地解释了我们的处境。
 因此，这将是99年的土地租赁。
 正如目前所看到的，我们将再次改变和发展，这就是我们将成为的人，
 停车场的所有者，但市政府将拥有其租约下的权利，这些权利将随着业主的使用而延长和控制，并可以保持对其所需和认为对运营重要的停车位的控制。
 在我里面
 在我的前世，几年前，我是马萨诸塞州一个社区的精选董事会成员，我们签署了几份土地开发协议，正如您现在在许多方面与我们所做的那样。
 与私人开发相比，进行土地开发交易并使其成为土地租赁可以为城市提供更多工具。
 我作为一名私人开发商来到这里，并向社区发展委员会展示了一些东西。
 在这里，不仅有许可证和批准来决定如何处理这些财产，而且还有一份租约，一份活的文件，一份持久的租赁文件。
 它将比我们所有人都长几十年来监督和确保对城市重要的事情、对社区重要的事情都以书面形式编入法典，具有法律约束力，并且我们的继任者，未来将担任我们各自职位的人，将有义务维持。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/ObzNxwbGKmg&t=5156.827s">[Justin Tseng]</a>: 谢谢你，佩德罗。
 我现在还有一个问题。
 这是我以前问过的问题，我认为既然我们是在公共场所，我认为有必要再问一次。
 Transom 是否已联系建筑工会探讨设计劳动合同来开展这项工作？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/ObzNxwbGKmg&t=5179.461s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: 是的，谢谢你提出这个问题。
 我们没有签约这个项目，但我们最近联系了梅德福另一个项目的运营商并跟进了他们。
 我们在业务和工作质量方面取得了巨大成功，其重要性对我们来说是毋庸置疑的。
 他们会的，我私下告诉他们，他们会公开说出来，他们会有一切机会。
 我们不选择总承包商。
 我们不会很快这样做。
 我们通常不会这么早就这样做，但无论我们与谁合作，他们肯定会有机会竞争并成为该项目的一部分。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/ObzNxwbGKmg&t=5225.667s">[Justin Tseng]</a>: 对此进行快速跟进。
 这个招标过程是怎样的？
 您寻找的标准是什么？
 您观察到的主要因素是什么？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/ObzNxwbGKmg&t=5233.992s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: 是的，我认为质量和价格确实是最重要的两件事。
 我认为，如果在这里进行交流并举行圆桌会议，我认为人们会认识到，从历史上看，质量是不存在问题的。
 好的？
 质量从来都不是问题。
 我认为价格始终是一个问题。
 这是每个企业的主题，对吗？
 达成交易与不达成交易之间的平衡。
 我认为交易者甚至认识到这一点。
 这实际上取决于与他们合作，找出他们在这个过程中可以在哪里获得最大利润以及在哪里可以取得最大成功。
 我们控制我们的总承包商。
 所以我们的总承包商经历了我们要求他经历的一个过程。
 所以这是一个平衡。
 这是确保我们的包容性和为每个人提供公平的完成任务的机会之间的平衡。
 归根结底，我们仍然有一个项目可以做。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/ObzNxwbGKmg&t=5292.558s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 谢谢。
 谢谢你，佩德罗。
 谢谢曾参赞。
 议员卡拉汉。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/ObzNxwbGKmg&t=5299.02s">[Anna Callahan]</a>: 谢谢。
 看到这个项目真的很酷。
 我只是想向听众中的任何人强调一些在这里发生的事情。
 在市中心梅德福广场拥有一家杂货店绝对是令人惊奇的。
 我真的很感激考虑继续在老年人中心前面设有底层停车场。
 我喜欢这样的想法：我们将与超越围墙的合作伙伴合作，他们能够将我们的社区融入到艺术品中，不仅仅是在那里拥有艺术品，而且实际上使其成为一件由我们社区驱动的艺术品。
 我知道我和很多在这里住了大半辈子的老年人谈过。
 他们不想住在自己的房子里，他们已经到了无法再维护房子的年龄。
 他们想缩小规模。
 他们不想离开梅德福。
 他们希望住得离朋友和邻居近一些。
 我从我自己的母亲那里知道了这一点
 随着年龄的增长，当你老到一个新的社区时，搬家并不容易。
 我希望年长的人留在这里，我认为我们正在考虑创建许多
 大小合适的房子，以便我们的老年人可以居住。
 当然，梅德福还有许多其他人也想住在一居室和两居室住宅中。
 所以我对这个项目感到非常兴奋。
 我想问一下，这些都是公寓吗？都是公寓吗？
 如果你现在知道了，如果你还在想的话。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/ObzNxwbGKmg&t=5403.565s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: 总统先生、卡拉汉议员，我们预计所有这些都将是公寓，而不是共管公寓。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/ObzNxwbGKmg&t=5412.889s">[Anna Callahan]</a>: 谢谢。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/ObzNxwbGKmg&t=5417.611s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 谢谢。参赞斯卡佩拉。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/ObzNxwbGKmg&t=5419.852s">[George Scarpelli]</a>: 谢谢董事长。
 我很抱歉迟到了。
 我上班有点迟到了，所以我很抱歉。
 我想我的问题是，即使你已经这么说了，请原谅我，但我认为我们的问题确实是针对这座城市的。
 我觉得真的
 推进这个项目，了解交通模式，了解车库。
 我知道我们似乎正在老年中心的街道上建一个车库，但它不在街对面。
 我认为来到我们老年人中心的老年人有一个很大的恐惧，那就是即使再远一点也太远了。
 我知道当我们一起工作时
 我的全职职位谈到了在我们接管的社区和不断发展的社区中进行的项目中支持老年人的创造性方法，并且我们研究了合作伙伴关系
 开发商和我们的城市正在共同努力建立一种交通服务，即使距离只有 100 或 150 米，我们的老年人也会感到舒适，当他们把车停在车库时，他们有一条安全的通道前往老年人中心。
 我认为非常重要的是
 我们稍后会介绍这一点。
 我很高兴我们正在做这个项目，但同样，我对这个过程的理解是错误的。
 当我们观察时，你知道，我们实际上是如何正确使用整个走廊的？
 我们在寻找吗？
 同样，这可能已经完成，但没有任何信息。
 不，社区不知道发生了这件事，但我们是否与 Riverside Mall 合作过？
 我们是否讨论过做一个项目并与他们合作？
 并重新安置他们的建筑物并重新开发整个方法广场，而不仅仅是我们的三个地块。
 同样，停车问题经常出现在城市的另一边。
 所以我猜它并没有真正被转化或者
 比这个特定的项目更重要的是，因为我们很高兴我们正在向前推进，因为我认为这是需要完成的事情，但还有很多问题是普通人还不知道的。
 你所听到的只是我们正在将三包行李带入城市的方法广场，我们正在进行这一令人难以置信的转变，但仍然存在很多问题。
 我希望这座城市做得更好。
 确保人们接受教育并了解整个过程。
 因为，正如我们过去一次又一次看到的那样，当我们只是将事情保留在泡沫中时，我们的社区就会出现巨大的分歧。
 再次，就像我说的，我认为我们需要对公众更加透明，确保每个人都了解我们经历了某些流程。
 再说一遍，我最大的要求是确保我们照顾好老年人。
 因为现在对他们来说，我们谈论这件事对他们来说绝对是毁灭性的。
 对于许多人来说，成为社区一部分的唯一部分就是老年人中心。
 事实上，我们拿走了街对面的地方，这让他们彻底失望了。
 我相信你们大多数人都听过这一点，我希望，并与你们的一些长辈交谈过，但我认为我们需要采取更好的方法
 教育我们社区的最佳工作。
 因此，我们消除了负面讨论和负面笑话，因为它们会造成分裂。
 再说一遍，这确实不是为了我们的主持人，而是为了我们的城市管理部门真正开始做好他们的工作，比我们在该市最近提出的几个主要关切和问题中看到的要好一些。
 谢谢你，总统先生。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/ObzNxwbGKmg&t=5664.504s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 谢谢斯卡佩利议员。
 乐明参赞。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/ObzNxwbGKmg&t=5668.737s">[Matt Leming]</a>: 我绝对同意需要更好的沟通，特别是与无法上网的老年人，他们实际上是通过口耳相传获得大部分信息的。
 彼得向辅导员做演讲时我很高兴。
 上周，当我专门向一些董事会成员询问此事时，他们说他们计划去老年人中心举办有关此事、有关该项目的信息发布会，以回答他们的问题。
 因为我知道议员拉扎罗·卡尔霍恩和我在去年，又一年，我们去了老年人中心，与那里的许多居民进行了同样的对话，我们正在努力，你知道，我们正在努力与他们沟通。
 事实上，您的停车位不会因这一开发而丢失。
 包含地下停车场。
 而且，你知道，在我们能够接触到其背后的开发人员之前，我无法确切地给出
 这方面有很多细节。
 因此，我认为对于那些非常熟悉计划细节的人来说，走出去与老年人私下交谈确实很有帮助。
 然后，非常明确地发布。
 网站、您的网站和城市网站上的计划和评论，供通过互联网获取信息的访问者使用。
 所以问题只是多种形式的沟通。
 关于我的同事关于老年人交通的观点，我已经与市长谈过，并且我已经在我们的规划委员会中推动这一点有一段时间了，也就是说，获取城市内交通需求管理计划。
 这是我们分区计划的一部分。
 通过这样的事情，我们可以让开发商分配一些资金，为公交车分配一些资金，然后这些公交车可以为城市服务。
 这些项目在埃弗里特非常成功，他们在那里
 由 TMA 支付费用的私人巴士在该地区提供交通服务，但不前往梅德福，因为我们的开发商实际上都不属于其中。
 所以，嗯，我们正在讨论的很多事情，这个委员会正在发生的很多事情，呃，呃，如果我们真正完成这些项目，这将解决居民给我们带来的很多担忧。
 所以谢谢你。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/ObzNxwbGKmg&t=5854.842s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 谢谢你，议员。
 我是说，议员拉扎罗。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/ObzNxwbGKmg&t=5858.777s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: 谢谢。
 谢谢您的介绍。
 我亦想重申雷明议员所提到的，就是本局议员和居民服务及公众参与委员会的成员定期在长者中心举行会议，讨论
 老年人和经常去老人中心的人感兴趣的各种问题。
 我认为选择这个特定的 RFP 是因为它包括停车位。
 它并不直接位于高级中心的旁边、下方或上方，但我不这么认为，我的意思是，我想你可能会说，一座不是停车场的建筑会更好地为这座城市提供服务，但我们拥有的是停车场。
 如果有必要达成妥协的话，我认为这是一个非常好的妥协。
 因此，我认为继续讨论公众参与是市长政府的一个好举措。
 议员们，我认为我们绝对可以邀请彼得和他团队的其他成员进行这次对话，但是有很多利益相关者，我们有很多人的经验同样重要，也有很多人可以在这座城市中获得快乐。
 当我们考虑不同人的需求时，我认为我们需要继续对话并保持沟通的开放。
 并保持邀请不断，并确保我们正在与对此感兴趣的每个人进行交谈。
 我还想提一下的是，正如亨特总监所提到的，关于梅德福广场分区的对话实际上会让我们更容易推进这个项目，如果我们能早日推进的话。
 彼得，您能否提及该计划中最高的建筑物有多高？
 我不记得演讲中是否提到过这一点。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/ObzNxwbGKmg&t=6004.753s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: 它的七层楼是最高的建筑。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/ObzNxwbGKmg&t=6010.639s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: 谢谢。
 七层楼，我不确定这是否是分区讨论的一部分，但它不是一座小建筑。
 但我认为，当我们继续讨论梅德福广场的分区问题时，需要记住这一点，为了获得我们有兴趣在这里使用的住房单元的数量，我们需要保持警惕，继续这些对话，并确保这是优先考虑的事情。
 谢谢。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/ObzNxwbGKmg&t=6041.065s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 谢谢拉扎罗参赞。
 理事会成员还有其他问题或意见吗？
 彼得，什么也没看到，关于接下来的步骤以及我们下一步的发展，您还有什么要补充的吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/ObzNxwbGKmg&t=6054.499s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: 不，没有什么特别的，总统先生，但我想邀请，我想是这样，同样我会确保那些没有我的联系方式的人能够看到，作为本地人的好处之一就是是我，对吗？
 我希望你们所有人都感受到，我希望你们感受到，当你们听到我们尚未接触到的居民的消息时，我们与骑士、老龄化委员会的对话有了一个良好的开端，
 和许多邻居。
 但我们仍然需要会见很多人，进行很多交谈，并对好想法持开放态度。
 我们致力于这样做。
 当我们无法做某事时，我们会通知您。
 但与此同时，我们将花费尽可能多的时间来确保我们听到好想法并实现它。
 感谢您与我们进行初步对话。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/ObzNxwbGKmg&t=6108.241s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 出色的。
 谢谢你，佩德罗。
 如果您能让我们知道，您知道，何时举行一些简报会和参与会议，您可以将它们发送给我，我会将它们发送到书记员办公室与董事会成员分享，以便他们也可以成为其中的一部分。
 请告诉我们。
 绝对地。
 出色的。
 我会将电话转给亨特总监以征求最终意见。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/ObzNxwbGKmg&t=6132.088s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: 谢谢总统先生。
 我只想分享最后一条评论。
 正如你们许多人所知，我们一直与 State Mass Development 合作开展这个项目。
 您可能还记得，他们提供了各种支持，从梅德福广场的 DIF 开始。
 这是为了支持其中的一部分。
 他们帮助我们，为我们提供了一位顾问来为这个过程编写 RFP。
 事实上，我联系了他们寻求房地产支持和其他建议。
 这将包括一些项目管理和具体帮助（他们不会进行外展，但他们会帮助我们做到这一点），将东西放在网站上，帮助我们弄清楚网站上应该有什么，分享什么以及何时分享。
 所以今天我会见了 Mass Development 的研发顾问，我认为我们能够让他们加入。
 很快就会通过该项目获得资金来帮助支付法律和咨询费用。
 所以我只是想分享一下，如果一切顺利，我们很可能会在未来几周内添加它们。
 我预计是下周，但被告知州政府不能这么快撤销合同。
 不管怎样，我希望这有助于实现人们所寻求的坚实的影响力。
 所以今晚非常感谢你们。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/ObzNxwbGKmg&t=6214.135s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 谢谢你，亨特导演。

 那边的杂货店真的是个好主意吗？
 交通街左侧曾经有一家超市。
 它已经在那里很多年了，而且大小还不错。
 我不记得公司的真实名称了。

 他们有多少个座位？
 或者需要停车吗？
 他们必须支付停车费。
