1
00:01:14,048 --> 00:01:15,445
[SPEAKER_01]: Reporting in Baja, Mexico.

2
00:03:20,931 --> 00:03:21,812
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything all right in there?

3
00:51:41,274 --> 00:52:05,133
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Kellyanne, Vice President Collins, Councilor Lazaro, Councilor Lemming, Councilor Scapelli, Councilor Singh,

4
00:52:06,648 --> 00:52:07,329
[SPEAKER_07]: President Beers.

5
00:52:07,429 --> 00:52:07,930
[SPEAKER_09]: Present.

6
00:52:08,971 --> 00:52:11,995
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm noting Councilor Collins was present on Zoom.

7
00:52:12,756 --> 00:52:14,679
[SPEAKER_09]: When she comes in, we'll note her presence.

8
00:52:14,879 --> 00:52:15,580
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

9
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:16,802
[SPEAKER_09]: Five present, two absent.

10
00:52:16,822 --> 00:52:18,144
[SPEAKER_09]: The meeting is called to order.

11
00:52:18,164 --> 00:52:22,390
[SPEAKER_09]: 25178, submitted by the author.

12
00:52:38,241 --> 00:52:38,781
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening.

13
00:52:42,523 --> 00:52:45,784
[SPEAKER_02]: Alicia Hunt, the Director of Planning, Development, and Sustainability.

14
00:52:45,804 --> 00:52:47,045
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm here with you this evening.

15
00:52:47,065 --> 00:52:59,030
[SPEAKER_02]: As all of the members of the Council are aware and most of the public, many years ago there have been decades of studies of Medford Square and plans and recommendations

16
00:52:59,670 --> 00:53:02,593
[SPEAKER_02]: And a couple years ago, we put out an RFP.

17
00:53:03,133 --> 00:53:05,995
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually hired a consultant to draft an RFP.

18
00:53:06,075 --> 00:53:26,812
[SPEAKER_02]: We put out an RFP for the redevelopment of the parking lots here with the goal of developing housing and replicating the parking that we do continue to need, but also adding housing and some additional commercial to Medford Square and to enliven this end of the square to connect the hotel to our active businesses a little further down.

19
00:53:28,714 --> 00:53:31,838
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a higher and better use of our public parking lots.

20
00:53:32,579 --> 00:53:38,525
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been in front of you before where we had a committee that reviewed the responses from the RFP.

21
00:53:41,733 --> 00:53:43,694
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to name who was on the committee.

22
00:53:43,714 --> 00:53:55,502
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm afraid of misspeaking, but Council President Behrs was on there, the chair of the Chamber of Commerce, also the representative from the Chevalier Theater was on that committee.

23
00:53:55,922 --> 00:54:01,185
[SPEAKER_02]: Commissioner Tim McGivern was on the committee, as well as Nina Nazarian, the chief of staff.

24
00:54:02,086 --> 00:54:06,008
[SPEAKER_02]: Mayor Brianna was on there, as well as myself and our economic development director.

25
00:54:06,429 --> 00:54:08,630
[SPEAKER_02]: To review the proposals, we had received two.

26
00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:10,071
[SPEAKER_02]: We recommended to this committee

27
00:54:10,771 --> 00:54:21,654
[SPEAKER_02]: One, to this Council, one of the proposals, transom, where Peter Speleos is the principal of that company.

28
00:54:22,334 --> 00:54:24,235
[SPEAKER_02]: Peter Speleos is with us here this evening.

29
00:54:24,275 --> 00:54:32,517
[SPEAKER_02]: We have started negotiations with them to get the details of the language of a land development agreement with him.

30
00:54:33,497 --> 00:54:40,202
[SPEAKER_02]: And we will be needing this body to vote at some point to release this property.

31
00:54:40,542 --> 00:54:45,225
[SPEAKER_02]: Technically, it has to be voted as a surplus property in order for this to happen.

32
00:54:45,665 --> 00:54:48,567
[SPEAKER_02]: I will be clear, we are not selling the property.

33
00:54:49,108 --> 00:54:50,869
[SPEAKER_02]: The plan is a 99-year lease.

34
00:54:51,289 --> 00:54:56,492
[SPEAKER_02]: That term is sufficient for a developer to get financing on the property as if they had purchased it.

35
00:54:59,869 --> 00:55:07,453
[SPEAKER_02]: leaves the property in the care and control of the city that cities, in my opinion, companies come and go, but cities are forever.

36
00:55:08,493 --> 00:55:18,118
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we would still maintain ownership of this property in the long term, but we would be leasing it on a long-term lease to Transom Real Estate.

37
00:55:19,198 --> 00:55:33,311
[SPEAKER_02]: And Peter Speleos is here this evening to share with you what our plans are, what his plans are for the property as we move through the negotiations to get a legal document that will be signed for this.

38
00:55:33,492 --> 00:55:40,798
[SPEAKER_02]: And at some point in the next weeks, two months, we will need this body to vote on that and to vote on the surplus property.

39
00:55:41,559 --> 00:55:50,867
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we did want to bring you up to speed on where things stand and at the same time share this information with the general public so that everybody is aware of where things are going.

40
00:55:51,287 --> 00:55:57,533
[SPEAKER_02]: We are still early enough in the negotiations that there are tweaks that can be made, but there was a proposal.

41
00:55:57,593 --> 00:56:00,916
[SPEAKER_02]: The proposal was two buildings and a parking garage.

42
00:56:01,876 --> 00:56:09,363
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that I'll leave the rest of that presentation to Peter because he has visuals that will help dramatically with the understanding of the proposal.

43
00:56:14,207 --> 00:56:14,647
[SPEAKER_04]: Good evening.

44
00:56:14,707 --> 00:56:15,687
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you hear me okay?

45
00:56:20,289 --> 00:56:21,569
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, now my mic is on.

46
00:56:22,590 --> 00:56:23,670
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, Peter, one second.

47
00:56:23,990 --> 00:56:24,610
[SPEAKER_09]: That's okay.

48
00:56:25,350 --> 00:56:29,512
[SPEAKER_09]: Just before I recognize you, just want to say thank you to Director Hunt.

49
00:56:31,172 --> 00:56:36,794
[SPEAKER_09]: Just wanted to note, the mayor and I were non-voting members on the committee, and I did have one question

50
00:56:37,605 --> 00:56:41,207
[SPEAKER_09]: there's a vote that we need to take to do surplus property.

51
00:56:42,487 --> 00:56:47,230
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess, are we 100% sure how many approvals this is gonna need from the council?

52
00:56:47,250 --> 00:56:48,530
[SPEAKER_09]: There's the surplus property vote.

53
00:56:48,731 --> 00:56:50,051
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there also a vote on the lease?

54
00:56:50,251 --> 00:56:53,133
[SPEAKER_09]: And then is there also a zoning consideration?

55
00:56:53,153 --> 00:57:01,697
[SPEAKER_02]: So to take those separately, under the current zoning in Medford, this proposal would need a lot of variances.

56
00:57:02,237 --> 00:57:03,518
[SPEAKER_02]: It is the city's intention

57
00:57:04,098 --> 00:57:11,084
[SPEAKER_02]: that we have been discussing rezoning in general, and there is general agreement that we need rezoning in Medford Square.

58
00:57:11,104 --> 00:57:22,254
[SPEAKER_02]: It is our hope that when we do the rezoning for Medford Square, it is my personal hope that that would be this winter, that that would allow these buildings to be done as of right.

59
00:57:22,714 --> 00:57:27,118
[SPEAKER_02]: If not, they would be allowed to be done with minor variances through the Zoning Board of Appeals.

60
00:57:28,038 --> 00:57:35,304
[SPEAKER_02]: But that they would, in general, in the big picture, would be allowed under the zoning, the zoning that was previously proposed.

61
00:57:35,664 --> 00:57:42,890
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a few little details that we would either need to negotiate, change, or go for variances on.

62
00:57:43,330 --> 00:57:44,271
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is one thing.

63
00:57:44,291 --> 00:57:49,074
[SPEAKER_02]: At this time, we are discussing that as a separate item.

64
00:57:49,154 --> 00:57:52,436
[SPEAKER_02]: It is zoning for the whole square and not just for these three parcels.

65
00:57:53,056 --> 00:58:03,163
[SPEAKER_02]: If it became necessary, he could put forward a motion, a proposal for just these three parcels as a planned development district, but that is not the current plan.

66
00:58:03,223 --> 00:58:06,725
[SPEAKER_02]: The current plan is that the rezoning of Medford Square would

67
00:58:07,646 --> 00:58:10,787
[SPEAKER_02]: in general, make this a feasible project.

68
00:58:11,287 --> 00:58:11,948
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is that.

69
00:58:12,888 --> 00:58:26,853
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still seeking clarity from our legal counsel as to whether we need city council approval for the 99-year lease, because if it was a sale, the only vote from the council would actually be the vote for surplus property.

70
00:58:27,393 --> 00:58:33,736
[SPEAKER_02]: So if it was a straight-up sale, this council would vote this is surplus property, the city could then sell the property.

71
00:58:34,176 --> 00:58:35,276
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's a 99-year lease,

72
00:58:37,077 --> 00:58:44,485
[SPEAKER_02]: and a mayor can only enter into a three-year agreement, we are still clarifying whether we actually need the permission to vote on that.

73
00:58:45,847 --> 00:58:57,019
[SPEAKER_02]: And to be clear, I'm not asking for any votes tonight, but we wanted to get information in front of you to have time to think about this, to get out any questions before we come in front of you for a vote.

74
00:58:58,357 --> 00:59:02,623
[SPEAKER_02]: But then the third one, potentially, is the vote for surplus property.

75
00:59:02,703 --> 00:59:04,325
[SPEAKER_02]: That is actually required.

76
00:59:05,327 --> 00:59:13,538
[SPEAKER_02]: And it actually is often in land disposition projects and redevelopment projects done before the property even goes out to RFP.

77
00:59:14,319 --> 00:59:23,111
[SPEAKER_02]: Often an RFP will say that the city has voted that this property is surplus property and is making it available for RFP.

78
00:59:23,432 --> 00:59:30,021
[SPEAKER_02]: That is not what Medford, Medford hasn't sold or redeveloped a property like this in more than approximately 15 years.

79
00:59:31,963 --> 00:59:39,607
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, our records from that period of time are a little sketchy, but it does seem that they waited until after the RFP for voting.

80
00:59:40,567 --> 00:59:45,790
[SPEAKER_02]: Many, most communities, according to mass development, actually vote before they ever put the RFP out.

81
00:59:46,270 --> 00:59:47,831
[SPEAKER_02]: So, just for your information.

82
00:59:49,072 --> 00:59:49,432
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

83
00:59:49,532 --> 00:59:54,435
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have any questions for Director Hunt before I turn this over to Peter Spellios?

84
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:00,481
[SPEAKER_09]: One question, I have Councilor Fleming.

85
01:00:01,481 --> 01:00:04,202
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a minor procedural question.

86
01:00:04,282 --> 01:00:08,983
[SPEAKER_08]: I probably do a little bit too in the weeds for this meeting, but I'm curious anyway.

87
01:00:10,083 --> 01:00:18,026
[SPEAKER_08]: We currently have a proposal for rezoning Medford Square that's attached to West Medford Square sitting in the Community Development Board.

88
01:00:18,046 --> 01:00:19,286
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's just kind of

89
01:00:20,362 --> 01:00:20,642
[SPEAKER_08]: there.

90
01:00:20,682 --> 01:00:43,737
[SPEAKER_08]: Hypothetically, would City Council have the authority to hold a joint public hearing with the CDB and then during that sever the West Medford Square from the Medford Square proposal and then refer it back to Council just to potentially speed up the process should the contracts go through and we continue the rezoning process?

91
01:00:44,801 --> 01:00:53,549
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, so to take those two separately, the City Council and the Community Development Board can choose to hold a joint public hearing, so that is possible.

92
01:00:54,710 --> 01:01:05,460
[SPEAKER_02]: Holding a hearing and choosing to sever it is something that the City Council could choose to sever the two, vote one through, and keep the other on the table.

93
01:01:06,581 --> 01:01:17,088
[SPEAKER_02]: And we are also working with legal to understand what is the best and cleanest process for moving forward the zoning measures that are on the table currently.

94
01:01:18,564 --> 01:01:40,970
[SPEAKER_02]: whether like for example some should be withdrawn and then resubmitted fresh later or whether we should and honestly to move forward with the existing Medford Square proposal severed from West Medford would be the quickest way because it is actually still a legal public hearing there it has been

95
01:01:42,995 --> 01:01:45,536
[SPEAKER_02]: It was tabled to a date certain by the CD board.

96
01:01:45,636 --> 01:01:48,057
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe that date is in January.

97
01:01:48,077 --> 01:01:54,719
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe the CD board voted, wanted to just put it far enough out so it wasn't an issue.

98
01:01:55,679 --> 01:02:01,781
[SPEAKER_02]: Because of the legal notice period, we need two weeks in a newspaper in order to hold a public hearing.

99
01:02:02,241 --> 01:02:08,803
[SPEAKER_02]: So that just sort of helps set expectations about when things could happen, but that one we could take up in January on that date certain.

100
01:02:09,064 --> 01:02:21,826
[SPEAKER_08]: And during a joint public hearing, does the City Council have the authority to vote as a body to sever that and then consider them separately during that same public hearing?

101
01:02:22,504 --> 01:02:30,006
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, so what would typically happen is that the CD board would make a recommendation back to the City Council.

102
01:02:30,646 --> 01:02:34,407
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's our recommendation on this, and we recommend that you sever them.

103
01:02:34,427 --> 01:02:41,269
[SPEAKER_02]: The City Council would take a vote to sever them and then would consider just the City Council.

104
01:02:42,389 --> 01:02:53,733
[SPEAKER_02]: the Medford Square portion of it, I think you would, for simplicity, declare at the beginning of the meeting that that was the intention and that you were only taking really considering that one portion of it.

105
01:02:54,593 --> 01:02:59,875
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the vote would come as part of you've had it referred back to you.

106
01:03:01,035 --> 01:03:10,238
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand from consultants that it is not uncommon for a city board and a city council to meet jointly in a joint public hearing on zoning matters.

107
01:03:11,819 --> 01:03:12,079
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

108
01:03:14,412 --> 01:03:14,992
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

109
01:03:15,133 --> 01:03:18,635
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing no further questions, I'll turn this over to Peter.

110
01:03:18,715 --> 01:03:24,339
[SPEAKER_09]: Peter, I know you have a presentation you should be able to share on Zoom and take it away.

111
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:25,140
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

112
01:03:25,220 --> 01:03:26,741
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

113
01:03:26,861 --> 01:03:29,503
[SPEAKER_04]: Members of the council, I just want to make sure that you can hear me fine.

114
01:03:31,384 --> 01:03:31,985
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, we can.

115
01:03:32,505 --> 01:03:33,867
[SPEAKER_04]: Great, thanks.

116
01:03:33,907 --> 01:03:35,309
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm excited to be here so early.

117
01:03:35,329 --> 01:03:42,558
[SPEAKER_04]: I know the city's been talking about this for a long time and you've all been working on it for a long time, but truly in terms of the evolution of kind of

118
01:03:45,032 --> 01:03:47,613
[SPEAKER_04]: the development overall and the idea and the visioning.

119
01:03:48,073 --> 01:03:58,937
[SPEAKER_04]: This is early and I think it's really great and a credit to you all that this conversation is happening to make sure people are aware and we have the greatest opportunity for input and collaboration.

120
01:03:58,957 --> 01:04:01,258
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to share my screen.

121
01:04:01,318 --> 01:04:11,341
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go through a relatively quick presentation, welcome people to interrupt me, but I really want to take the conversation where the council would like to.

122
01:04:11,441 --> 01:04:13,522
[SPEAKER_04]: So bear with me one second here.

123
01:04:20,665 --> 01:04:22,267
[SPEAKER_04]: Give it a second.

124
01:04:22,767 --> 01:04:25,810
[SPEAKER_04]: You should be able to see my screen.

125
01:04:29,173 --> 01:04:31,155
[SPEAKER_04]: Just want to confirm you folks can see my screen okay?

126
01:04:31,435 --> 01:04:32,556
[SPEAKER_09]: We can see your screen.

127
01:04:32,956 --> 01:04:33,197
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

128
01:04:33,217 --> 01:04:35,399
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to put it in full screen mode to make it even better.

129
01:04:38,996 --> 01:04:39,696
[SPEAKER_04]: Good evening, everyone.

130
01:04:39,856 --> 01:04:42,758
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm Peter Spellios with Transom Real Estate.

131
01:04:43,178 --> 01:04:47,719
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll talk a little bit at the end about Transom, but we're a Boston-based company.

132
01:04:47,939 --> 01:04:51,101
[SPEAKER_04]: All the principals live and work here.

133
01:04:52,081 --> 01:04:54,602
[SPEAKER_04]: We are Boston-centric.

134
01:04:54,902 --> 01:04:59,584
[SPEAKER_04]: All of our projects are, if not a tea ride, a short car ride.

135
01:05:00,684 --> 01:05:01,304
[SPEAKER_04]: for us all.

136
01:05:02,305 --> 01:05:10,408
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to start by focusing really quickly on the team and in particular one, two, but one in particular member of our team.

137
01:05:10,608 --> 01:05:17,350
[SPEAKER_04]: When we saw this RFP, we really, the RFP was really very well done in putting forth a vision.

138
01:05:18,090 --> 01:05:26,495
[SPEAKER_04]: and making clear to anyone, whether or not you've been in Medford Square once or you've been in Medford Square a million times, that these are really important parcels.

139
01:05:27,856 --> 01:05:39,422
[SPEAKER_04]: Parcels that, frankly, are important from every direction and every perspective, whether or not you're a resident living there, whether you're a business there, or you're walking through, you're driving through, no matter which direction you're coming from.

140
01:05:39,442 --> 01:05:42,684
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we brought on PCA as the project architect.

141
01:05:43,744 --> 01:06:07,402
[SPEAKER_04]: PCA may not be a firm that you folks know by name or is a household name, but what's really important is PCA is the architect and really the design brainchild behind a lot of very successful dynamic mixed-use projects, many of which you would know about, Legacy Place in Dedham, Chestnut Hill, Linfield Market.

142
01:06:09,042 --> 01:06:09,803
[SPEAKER_04]: to name a few.

143
01:06:11,103 --> 01:06:28,808
[SPEAKER_04]: We thought it was really important to bring someone who not only could do a lovely job designing a residential project, but really focus on the street level, right, that first 30 feet of a building, the one that everybody that passes by experiences, the one that adds life and vibrancy to any neighborhood.

144
01:06:30,708 --> 01:06:32,509
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're excited that they're part of the team.

145
01:06:33,650 --> 01:06:36,852
[SPEAKER_04]: Another team member is Beyond Walls.

146
01:06:37,733 --> 01:06:45,058
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of you may be aware of Beyond Walls, which is a nonprofit, which is really specialized in public art, murals.

147
01:06:45,118 --> 01:06:53,644
[SPEAKER_04]: If you've been to the city of Lynn, if you've been any number of cities in and around Boston now, you're familiar with these really incredible

148
01:06:54,244 --> 01:07:09,886
[SPEAKER_04]: murals and art installations that Beyond Walls has done, working with local communities, working with local schools, working with other nonprofits to really advance art and interest, and I'll talk a little bit more about them briefly.

149
01:07:11,027 --> 01:07:14,129
[SPEAKER_04]: I had already mentioned, excuse me, PCA.

150
01:07:14,889 --> 01:07:22,073
[SPEAKER_04]: The most recent dynamic mixed-use village is actually just north of our border in Salem, New Hampshire by PCA, Tuscan Village.

151
01:07:22,734 --> 01:07:30,198
[SPEAKER_04]: But as I mentioned, PCA was instrumental with Market Street, Linfield, the street in Chestnut Hill, and legacy place, Dedham.

152
01:07:32,487 --> 01:07:38,052
[SPEAKER_04]: As you all know, these are the three parking lots for which the RFP was put out for.

153
01:07:39,853 --> 01:07:51,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, remarkably dynamic parcels given that they are just asphalt gardens for the most part currently, but really important parcels.

154
01:07:51,743 --> 01:07:55,206
[SPEAKER_04]: The RFP that went out was really clear about

155
01:07:56,467 --> 01:07:56,968
[SPEAKER_04]: several things.

156
01:07:57,668 --> 01:08:04,296
[SPEAKER_04]: One being, I'm going to just deal with the least interesting part, but very important part, parking, right?

157
01:08:04,316 --> 01:08:06,618
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of parking that's on these parcels today.

158
01:08:06,979 --> 01:08:13,086
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of demand for parking, especially for City Hall, especially for the Senior Center and some of the neighbors.

159
01:08:13,406 --> 01:08:15,508
[SPEAKER_04]: So making sure that whatever plan happened

160
01:08:16,129 --> 01:08:20,092
[SPEAKER_04]: dealt with the realities of parking was number one.

161
01:08:20,132 --> 01:08:34,884
[SPEAKER_04]: Number two, and again these are not nor does our priority, number two was a desire to bring people downtown, to bring people living here, to build housing downtown and have a core focus on housing.

162
01:08:35,985 --> 01:08:36,186
[SPEAKER_04]: Third,

163
01:08:38,293 --> 01:08:55,739
[SPEAKER_04]: putting some street front retail here with particular interest in a grocer and having an urban grocer or a downtown grocer added to the list of other retail opportunities in Medford was a really important element.

164
01:08:55,879 --> 01:09:02,482
[SPEAKER_04]: And then last, and again, the list goes on, but I'm just highlighting just a couple on the top, is really connectivity.

165
01:09:02,902 --> 01:09:23,096
[SPEAKER_04]: coming up with a project that doesn't have a front or a back, doesn't have a left or a right, but really is a project that speaks to its neighbors from all sides, that communicates with every resident, every business, and really hopefully is done in a way that sets the table for other things to happen down the road in Medford Square.

166
01:09:26,495 --> 01:09:39,680
[SPEAKER_04]: You folks have, as Alicia mentioned earlier, done a significant amount of planning and Medford really has, I think, an envy of a lot of roadmap of how to do these type of things.

167
01:09:39,780 --> 01:09:46,242
[SPEAKER_04]: And so when we were making our proposal to the city, we reviewed all these plans, the comprehensive plan,

168
01:09:47,542 --> 01:10:01,491
[SPEAKER_04]: the interest in public art, resiliency and sustainability, to make sure that we were addressing things that we knew by virtue of these plans and other initiatives, that we were addressing the things that were important to you all and to the city.

169
01:10:03,445 --> 01:10:07,529
[SPEAKER_04]: This screen here puts forth some metrics of what the project could look like.

170
01:10:08,710 --> 01:10:12,093
[SPEAKER_04]: I say could look like because we've responded to an RFP.

171
01:10:12,993 --> 01:10:17,217
[SPEAKER_04]: We're grateful and very enthusiastic about continuing this conversation.

172
01:10:17,678 --> 01:10:22,562
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is what our original thoughts from the RFP looked like in just numbers.

173
01:10:23,923 --> 01:10:32,048
[SPEAKER_04]: This will evolve, this will change, this will be fluid based on feedback from you all, from stakeholders in the city.

174
01:10:33,509 --> 01:10:41,915
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I want this to be seen as where we are now, understanding that this is very early on in the process.

175
01:10:42,335 --> 01:10:50,261
[SPEAKER_04]: So we think appropriately in density wise, approximately 300 residential units here, 20% of which would be affordable units.

176
01:10:54,604 --> 01:11:01,870
[SPEAKER_04]: which we think is a really important part to make sure that you do have the mix of income stratification in your housing stock.

177
01:11:02,410 --> 01:11:03,772
[SPEAKER_04]: I mentioned the local grocer.

178
01:11:05,313 --> 01:11:10,077
[SPEAKER_04]: We are proposing approximately 15,000 square foot grocer.

179
01:11:11,698 --> 01:11:12,918
[SPEAKER_04]: on one of the parcels.

180
01:11:13,859 --> 01:11:23,041
[SPEAKER_04]: Importantly, residential, and I'm happy to talk more as the Council would like to, residential is something that you can build almost always if the financing markets are available.

181
01:11:23,541 --> 01:11:27,402
[SPEAKER_04]: But retail, especially grocery stores, you really are subject to the market.

182
01:11:27,462 --> 01:11:29,123
[SPEAKER_04]: Where is the market at any given time?

183
01:11:30,103 --> 01:11:33,664
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm excited because we're, you are doing this RFP.

184
01:11:33,764 --> 01:11:42,886
[SPEAKER_04]: We are collectively collaborating on this RFP at a point in time where the grocery market, the urban grocers are increasing in numbers.

185
01:11:43,606 --> 01:11:46,827
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is a market where they're looking for growth.

186
01:11:47,327 --> 01:11:58,350
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think as though we have an opportunity here, not just to talk about a grocery store, but really to put a dynamic grocer downtown that I think is really important.

187
01:11:59,953 --> 01:12:00,273
[SPEAKER_04]: parking.

188
01:12:00,313 --> 01:12:14,862
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll talk a little bit more about parking again in a minute here, but we are providing ample parking for City Hall and for visitors to City Hall and for City Hall business and staff.

189
01:12:16,903 --> 01:12:22,345
[SPEAKER_04]: And we are also providing public parking for the senior center.

190
01:12:23,286 --> 01:12:33,410
[SPEAKER_04]: Very early on, the mayor and staff have been very clear about the importance of making sure that this project be a benefit to the Council on Aging.

191
01:12:34,510 --> 01:12:42,794
[SPEAKER_04]: I met with the executive director recently of the Council on Aging to just start and make sure we had names and faces with each other to make sure that we are

192
01:12:43,354 --> 01:12:52,523
[SPEAKER_04]: having a good dialogue and that she felt comfortable reaching out to me and as this progresses, knowing that we're going to be in touch to figure out how to create that connectivity.

193
01:12:52,603 --> 01:13:01,772
[SPEAKER_04]: The grocery store is currently designed right across the street from the Council on Aging, which we also think is really important as an amenity as well.

194
01:13:03,174 --> 01:13:05,896
[SPEAKER_04]: I mentioned beyond walls and public art.

195
01:13:06,978 --> 01:13:12,102
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, I just fundamentally in my core believe that there can't be fronts or backs to these buildings.

196
01:13:12,983 --> 01:13:20,170
[SPEAKER_04]: And while the people that live in the building may not see the buildings, you know, if you will.

197
01:13:22,785 --> 01:13:28,728
[SPEAKER_04]: and care as much about the exterior as they do the interior, the reality is 99.9% of the world sees it from the outside.

198
01:13:29,388 --> 01:13:49,618
[SPEAKER_04]: And so these buildings themselves are pieces of sculpture, but we can do it in a way to make the first 30 feet for sure very vibrant, very interesting to not only make people wanna be there and feel safe, but also to attract others and help other existing businesses in Medford Square prosper.

199
01:13:51,291 --> 01:13:58,493
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the last thing, which I guess two quick things here is resiliency we'll talk about and sustainability.

200
01:13:59,133 --> 01:14:01,674
[SPEAKER_04]: You folks are champions on this topic.

201
01:14:02,154 --> 01:14:09,515
[SPEAKER_04]: This project will be passive house, which is a really important and terrific goal.

202
01:14:09,635 --> 01:14:10,636
[SPEAKER_04]: It will be all electric.

203
01:14:11,936 --> 01:14:15,057
[SPEAKER_04]: And then lastly here is green spaces and connectivity.

204
01:14:16,417 --> 01:14:23,039
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's really important to just further accentuate what I was talking about with connectivity.

205
01:14:23,119 --> 01:14:33,622
[SPEAKER_04]: We looked at this from every direction, pedestrian, whether you're on foot, scooter, car, in the back seat of a car, front seat of a car, to understand really

206
01:14:34,542 --> 01:14:50,030
[SPEAKER_04]: how to create the connectivity, how to bring people from one place to another, how to help people navigate through signage and nonverbal markers to the river, which is only getting better and better with the trail network.

207
01:14:50,810 --> 01:14:55,212
[SPEAKER_04]: And so how do we make them easier to get to City Hall?

208
01:14:55,252 --> 01:15:00,255
[SPEAKER_04]: How do we make it safer and more convenient for seniors to get to the Council on Aging?

209
01:15:02,142 --> 01:15:04,523
[SPEAKER_04]: In doing that, we look at a bunch of core areas.

210
01:15:04,543 --> 01:15:10,347
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is a first take, if you will, about those same three parking lots we were talking about before.

211
01:15:10,407 --> 01:15:15,950
[SPEAKER_04]: On the upper right-hand side is where we're suggesting the parking garage go up against I-93.

212
01:15:19,032 --> 01:15:22,093
[SPEAKER_04]: That will have both surface parking and a parking lot.

213
01:15:22,573 --> 01:15:32,335
[SPEAKER_04]: As you may recall, the Hyatt has the benefit of a easement with the city to allow parking on a portion of that for the hotel.

214
01:15:32,375 --> 01:15:39,256
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we will certainly be making accommodations for that and making sure we don't interfere with those rights for the Hyatt Hotel there.

215
01:15:39,796 --> 01:15:47,238
[SPEAKER_04]: And then as we move down plan south, if you will, to the screen, you see the two residential buildings, one on lot B and one on lot A.

216
01:15:47,918 --> 01:15:56,345
[SPEAKER_04]: Lot B being the larger of the two residential buildings that also has some ground floor retail and public outdoor space and courtyards.

217
01:15:56,805 --> 01:16:05,172
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Lot A being the one right across the street from the Council Aging, which is where the grocery store would most likely be located.

218
01:16:06,433 --> 01:16:10,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Showing this to really show the key is how do you weave these together, right?

219
01:16:10,515 --> 01:16:11,976
[SPEAKER_04]: So they can become a linear park.

220
01:16:12,656 --> 01:16:16,758
[SPEAKER_04]: They can become something both through verbal and nonverbal cues.

221
01:16:18,498 --> 01:16:24,741
[SPEAKER_04]: Really set this table for Medford Square and hopefully in a way that does a couple of things.

222
01:16:24,901 --> 01:16:28,283
[SPEAKER_04]: One, creates connectivity to the rest of Medford Square.

223
01:16:29,423 --> 01:16:49,670
[SPEAKER_04]: Two, sets a standard, hopefully, to get success and to help others increase traffic volume for business, foot traffic for business, so that the businesses that are there now and future businesses will thrive in these locations.

224
01:16:50,850 --> 01:17:02,196
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, different techniques that will do it different of these spaces here, whether it's roadway improvements in terms of sidewalk improvements in terms of race crosswalks.

225
01:17:02,577 --> 01:17:13,963
[SPEAKER_04]: There are so many tools available in the toolbox for us to partner with the city on both on these parcels and for the city to look at for some of its adjacent streets as well as a project.

226
01:17:14,543 --> 01:17:18,086
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, I've already mentioned the retail, so I won't spend much time here.

227
01:17:18,226 --> 01:17:30,436
[SPEAKER_04]: We really think as though we have an opportunity, a window here because the grocery market, the urban grocery market has been growing and they're in a growth mode right now.

228
01:17:32,217 --> 01:17:37,902
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we think we're in a good position to be able to execute on that, which is very exciting.

229
01:17:39,522 --> 01:17:41,023
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I've already mentioned Beyond Walls.

230
01:17:41,544 --> 01:17:46,768
[SPEAKER_04]: I encourage you, if you ever have a Saturday that you want to go to Lynn, do a mural tour in the city of Lynn.

231
01:17:46,888 --> 01:17:53,133
[SPEAKER_04]: It is the most remarkable way to see a city, is by looking up the entire time at the buildings.

232
01:17:53,913 --> 01:18:03,441
[SPEAKER_04]: But really excited that they agreed to partner with us and to bring that energy and their collaboration with the community here.

233
01:18:05,178 --> 01:18:06,219
[SPEAKER_04]: I mentioned parking before.

234
01:18:06,599 --> 01:18:24,333
[SPEAKER_04]: Preliminarily, this project provides upwards to 600 parking spaces, which will include 100 parking spaces dedicated just for staff and visitors to City Hall at no cost, and then also includes parking that's dispersed throughout the project.

235
01:18:25,253 --> 01:18:33,778
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, the goal is not to start with asphalt gardens and finish with asphalt gardens, but again, do it in a way that the parking kind of fades away.

236
01:18:33,918 --> 01:18:37,420
[SPEAKER_04]: It's convenient, it's there, but it's no longer the focal point.

237
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:52,928
[SPEAKER_04]: And most especially, as I mentioned before, is really working with the city, working with the Council on Aging on how to create better connectivity, how to create more convenient parking and safer access and more comfortable access to the Council on Aging.

238
01:18:54,898 --> 01:18:57,879
[SPEAKER_04]: I already mentioned the sustainability passive house construction.

239
01:18:58,659 --> 01:19:04,221
[SPEAKER_04]: We're excited to roll up our sleeves and have the design team go to work on this.

240
01:19:05,721 --> 01:19:06,341
[SPEAKER_04]: These are images.

241
01:19:06,521 --> 01:19:07,342
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just images.

242
01:19:07,362 --> 01:19:16,624
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not necessarily images of what is going to end up in Medford Square, but just to kind of give a sense of the connectivity and the place that can be built and the vibrancy.

243
01:19:17,745 --> 01:19:17,925
[SPEAKER_04]: Again,

244
01:19:19,709 --> 01:19:24,793
[SPEAKER_04]: The first 20 feet, 25 feet of a building is the one that most people experience.

245
01:19:25,413 --> 01:19:32,038
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to make sure that on all sides and all ways, these are communicating to all the neighbors around us.

246
01:19:33,479 --> 01:19:40,944
[SPEAKER_04]: This is if you're just to the left of City Hall, looking to the rear of City Hall on the left-hand side, potentially is where the parking garage would be up against 93.

247
01:19:41,064 --> 01:19:45,567
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can see the Hyatt in the rear.

248
01:19:49,621 --> 01:19:59,306
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, ideas right and I'm really excited that this is the start of conversation and really a lot of people have reached out and and we're excited about it.

249
01:19:59,706 --> 01:20:06,190
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, lastly, I'm just going to end with kind of schedule schedule is a very fluid thing as Alicia kind of intimated about.

250
01:20:06,770 --> 01:20:11,554
[SPEAKER_04]: We're having really good conversations about the formalizing the legal documentation.

251
01:20:11,714 --> 01:20:34,811
[SPEAKER_04]: Not very interesting legal documentation, but interesting because it's going to unleash, I think, a flurry of activity that we can take these ideas and we can take the things that we're hearing from the city, that we're hearing from you, that we're hearing from the neighbors, and bring it to life so that we can have more community conversations and we can go through a permitting process with the city.

252
01:20:36,032 --> 01:20:42,598
[SPEAKER_04]: We are aware of the draft zoning that was out for Medford Square.

253
01:20:42,758 --> 01:20:44,259
[SPEAKER_04]: We did comment to staff.

254
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:47,042
[SPEAKER_04]: We actually think it's in really good shape.

255
01:20:47,802 --> 01:20:49,384
[SPEAKER_04]: We did have some comments that we shared.

256
01:20:50,385 --> 01:20:56,450
[SPEAKER_04]: We're excited to roll up our sleeves and work with the council and staff to see that through and happy to talk about it.

257
01:20:57,170 --> 01:21:01,733
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and then construction is roughly, um, you know, 24 months.

258
01:21:02,133 --> 01:21:11,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, if again, I think there's going to be some sequencing because we're going to be very careful about not displacing everything at once and making sure there's always parking and making sure that we're doing things.

259
01:21:11,099 --> 01:21:19,964
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll have to work out the details of how to sequence things and make sure everything's done appropriately to minimize disruption, but also accelerate, uh, completion.

260
01:21:20,744 --> 01:21:24,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so that's also something we'll be having conversation with the city about.

261
01:21:25,761 --> 01:21:27,522
[SPEAKER_04]: And then very last is Transom.

262
01:21:28,102 --> 01:21:35,485
[SPEAKER_04]: I leave them last because I think that's us and we're important because we see ourselves as now a partner with you all.

263
01:21:36,545 --> 01:21:40,847
[SPEAKER_04]: And I really am really proud of what we focus on at Transom.

264
01:21:43,248 --> 01:21:43,988
[SPEAKER_04]: It really is.

265
01:21:44,408 --> 01:21:52,250
[SPEAKER_04]: We, I think, do a great job for the residents and people that are in our building and use our building, but I think we do an even better job for the neighborhoods and the communities.

266
01:21:53,290 --> 01:22:05,633
[SPEAKER_04]: I tell everybody that has ever worked with Transom and people that allow me to bend their ear is developers make a mistake and they act like it's their last project they're doing in a community.

267
01:22:05,673 --> 01:22:12,234
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think development companies, if they really wanted to do good for themselves, they would treat every project like it's their first.

268
01:22:12,954 --> 01:22:15,396
[SPEAKER_04]: project in a community, not their last.

269
01:22:16,156 --> 01:22:25,042
[SPEAKER_04]: And because we are all local, because we are here, my wife and I spent our first years of marriage living on Humav in Medford.

270
01:22:26,686 --> 01:22:28,427
[SPEAKER_04]: We care deeply about it.

271
01:22:28,507 --> 01:22:35,228
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to leave significant pieces of architecture in communities here.

272
01:22:35,849 --> 01:22:45,291
[SPEAKER_04]: And we think we've been successful and the communities in which we've been in our communities that we would be welcomed in again and again.

273
01:22:45,571 --> 01:22:47,612
[SPEAKER_04]: And so with that,

274
01:22:48,702 --> 01:22:50,142
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna stop sharing.

275
01:22:50,282 --> 01:22:56,244
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm happy to go back to any screen or to whatever you folks wanna take the conversation.

276
01:22:56,304 --> 01:22:57,344
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you, Mr. President.

277
01:22:59,705 --> 01:23:00,225
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Peter.

278
01:23:00,245 --> 01:23:08,147
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, do we have questions from members of the council at this time for Peter about the presentation or the project?

279
01:23:13,948 --> 01:23:17,649
[SPEAKER_09]: Sounds like there's still some work left to do, so I'll go to Councilor Sang.

280
01:23:19,222 --> 01:23:19,882
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Peter.

281
01:23:20,863 --> 01:23:25,445
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to thank you for having met with, I think, a number of Councillors before.

282
01:23:25,465 --> 01:23:30,547
[SPEAKER_06]: I know we talked ahead of this presentation.

283
01:23:32,228 --> 01:23:40,072
[SPEAKER_06]: Back when we talked, I think we talked a little bit about how the legalities would work with the parking lot.

284
01:23:41,494 --> 01:23:45,718
[SPEAKER_06]: how we could operate that while still keeping the land under city ownership.

285
01:23:47,219 --> 01:23:58,570
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm curious as to if there are any other legal details we need to sort out before we take a vote on this, before this project goes into effect that are along the lines of that.

286
01:24:03,384 --> 01:24:05,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, would you like me to speak to that?

287
01:24:05,305 --> 01:24:05,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, go ahead.

288
01:24:06,266 --> 01:24:06,586
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

289
01:24:06,686 --> 01:24:12,390
[SPEAKER_04]: Or unless you'd like someone from the city to... No, I think, Councilor, thank you.

290
01:24:12,451 --> 01:24:15,533
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, and I appreciate the conversation.

291
01:24:16,153 --> 01:24:20,756
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Alicia did a good job explaining kind of where we are.

292
01:24:20,817 --> 01:24:23,418
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's gonna be a 99-year-old ground lease.

293
01:24:24,199 --> 01:24:31,424
[SPEAKER_04]: We will, the way in which it's currently contemplated, again, can change and can evolve, is we will be the,

294
01:24:32,885 --> 01:24:51,569
[SPEAKER_04]: owners of the parking garage, but the city will have rights under its lease agreements, which will extend and control as the landlord to use and be able to maintain the control of the parking spaces that they need and deem important for the operation.

295
01:24:52,530 --> 01:24:52,770
[SPEAKER_04]: In my

296
01:24:53,870 --> 01:25:07,061
[SPEAKER_04]: Former life going back a couple years ago I was on a select board in a Massachusetts community and I, we did several land development agreements like you folks are now doing with us in many respects.

297
01:25:08,201 --> 01:25:15,245
[SPEAKER_04]: doing a land development agreement and having it be a ground lease actually gives the city greater tools than if it was just a private development.

298
01:25:15,285 --> 01:25:20,108
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was just here as a private developer coming and filing something with the Community Development Board.

299
01:25:21,229 --> 01:25:30,975
[SPEAKER_04]: Here, there's not just permits and approvals that will dictate what is done to these properties, but there's actually going to be a lease, a living document, a lease document that's going to last.

300
01:25:33,016 --> 01:25:54,706
[SPEAKER_04]: be in place for decades longer than all of us to control and make sure that the things that the city cares about, things that the neighborhoods care about, are codified in writing, are legally binding, and that our successors, people that will fill our respective chairs years down the road, will be obliged to maintain.

301
01:25:56,827 --> 01:25:57,427
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Peter.

302
01:25:57,787 --> 01:25:59,208
[SPEAKER_06]: I have one more question right now.

303
01:26:00,548 --> 01:26:06,230
[SPEAKER_06]: This is something I had asked you before, and I think seeing as we're in a public setting, I think it's important to ask again.

304
01:26:08,230 --> 01:26:17,853
[SPEAKER_06]: Has Transom reached out to the Building Trades Union with regards to exploring a project labor agreement to get this work done?

305
01:26:19,461 --> 01:26:20,562
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, thanks for that question.

306
01:26:21,163 --> 01:26:32,914
[SPEAKER_04]: We have not asked to this project, but we've actually recently been in touch with the trades on another Medford project and have actually had follow up with them.

307
01:26:34,355 --> 01:26:41,382
[SPEAKER_04]: We've had great success with the trades and the quality of work and the importance is unquestionable to us.

308
01:26:42,262 --> 01:26:48,327
[SPEAKER_04]: They will, and I've said this to them privately, would say it publicly, they would have every opportunity.

309
01:26:49,368 --> 01:26:51,110
[SPEAKER_04]: We haven't selected a general contractor.

310
01:26:51,150 --> 01:26:52,571
[SPEAKER_04]: We wouldn't this early.

311
01:26:52,671 --> 01:27:04,020
[SPEAKER_04]: We typically don't this early, but certainly whoever we work with, they would certainly have opportunities to be bidding and be part of this project.

312
01:27:05,667 --> 01:27:07,008
[SPEAKER_06]: And just a quick follow up on that.

313
01:27:07,068 --> 01:27:09,349
[SPEAKER_06]: What does that bidding process look like?

314
01:27:09,890 --> 01:27:11,391
[SPEAKER_06]: Are there criteria you look for?

315
01:27:11,491 --> 01:27:13,272
[SPEAKER_06]: What are the main factors you look at?

316
01:27:13,992 --> 01:27:21,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so I think there's quality and price is really the two things that really come down to it.

317
01:27:21,576 --> 01:27:30,582
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that if the trades were here and we were having a round table conversation, I think there would be acknowledgement that I think historically, there's no question about quality.

318
01:27:31,122 --> 01:27:31,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?

319
01:27:31,442 --> 01:27:32,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Quality is never the question.

320
01:27:32,742 --> 01:27:35,243
[SPEAKER_04]: I think pricing is always an issue.

321
01:27:35,403 --> 01:27:36,803
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an issue for every deal, right?

322
01:27:37,463 --> 01:27:40,544
[SPEAKER_04]: The balance between making a deal happen or not.

323
01:27:40,884 --> 01:27:42,524
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the trades even acknowledge that.

324
01:27:42,584 --> 01:27:52,626
[SPEAKER_04]: So really what it comes down to is working with them and find where can they be most cost effective, where they can be most successful in that process.

325
01:27:53,466 --> 01:27:55,647
[SPEAKER_04]: We control our general contractor.

326
01:27:55,787 --> 01:27:59,968
[SPEAKER_04]: So our general contractor goes through a process that we require them to go through.

327
01:28:01,448 --> 01:28:02,129
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a balance.

328
01:28:02,189 --> 01:28:08,034
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a balance between making sure that we are inclusive, that we give everybody a fair opportunity to do things.

329
01:28:08,234 --> 01:28:11,117
[SPEAKER_04]: And at the end of the day, we still have a project that we're able to execute on.

330
01:28:12,558 --> 01:28:12,898
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

331
01:28:14,780 --> 01:28:15,340
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Peter.

332
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:16,361
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Sang.

333
01:28:16,441 --> 01:28:17,302
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Callahan.

334
01:28:19,020 --> 01:28:19,901
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

335
01:28:21,442 --> 01:28:23,464
[SPEAKER_01]: It is really great to see this project.

336
01:28:24,365 --> 01:28:29,430
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to just reinforce some of the things that are coming in here for anybody in the public who's listening.

337
01:28:30,691 --> 01:28:35,656
[SPEAKER_01]: Having a grocery right in downtown Medford Square is going to be absolutely amazing.

338
01:28:35,676 --> 01:28:42,763
[SPEAKER_01]: I so appreciate the thoughtfulness about continuing to have ground level parking right across from the senior center.

339
01:28:44,123 --> 01:28:58,831
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the idea that we are going to work with a partner beyond walls that will be able to incorporate our community in the artwork, not just to have artwork there, but so that it is in fact like artwork sort of driven by our community.

340
01:29:01,332 --> 01:29:09,936
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that, you know, I've talked to so many seniors who, you know, have lived here most of their lives.

341
01:29:10,156 --> 01:29:17,139
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want to live in their, they're at the age where they cannot upkeep their house anymore.

342
01:29:17,499 --> 01:29:18,519
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to downsize.

343
01:29:18,559 --> 01:29:19,900
[SPEAKER_01]: They do not want to leave Medford.

344
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:21,980
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to live near their friends and neighbors.

345
01:29:23,561 --> 01:29:25,282
[SPEAKER_01]: I know from my own mom,

346
01:29:25,922 --> 01:29:31,088
[SPEAKER_01]: getting older, that it is not easy to move when you're old to a new community.

347
01:29:31,509 --> 01:29:37,796
[SPEAKER_01]: I want our seniors to stay here and I think it's wonderful that we are looking at creating a ton of

348
01:29:40,063 --> 01:29:45,307
[SPEAKER_01]: housing that is the right size for our seniors to downsize into.

349
01:29:45,388 --> 01:29:50,532
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, there are many other people here in Medford who also are looking to live in a one bedroom, a two bedroom.

350
01:29:50,552 --> 01:29:53,675
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm very excited about the project.

351
01:29:53,975 --> 01:29:58,318
[SPEAKER_01]: I do want to ask if any of these are condos, are they all going to be apartments?

352
01:29:58,939 --> 01:30:01,321
[SPEAKER_01]: If you know that at this time, if you're still thinking about that.

353
01:30:03,565 --> 01:30:10,428
[SPEAKER_04]: Through you, Mr. President, Councilor Callahan, we would anticipate all these to be apartments and not to be condominiums.

354
01:30:12,889 --> 01:30:13,129
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.

355
01:30:17,611 --> 01:30:18,172
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

356
01:30:18,352 --> 01:30:19,132
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scarapelli.

357
01:30:19,852 --> 01:30:20,773
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Council President.

358
01:30:21,613 --> 01:30:23,194
[SPEAKER_05]: I apologize for being late.

359
01:30:24,148 --> 01:30:26,189
[SPEAKER_05]: running a little late from work, so I apologize.

360
01:30:26,329 --> 01:30:36,635
[SPEAKER_05]: I think my question is really that if you've already said this, forgive me, but I think that the questions we have is really for the city.

361
01:30:36,855 --> 01:30:38,616
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that really

362
01:30:39,547 --> 01:30:44,831
[SPEAKER_05]: moving forward with this project, understanding traffic patterns, understanding the garage.

363
01:30:44,871 --> 01:30:51,416
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it sounds that we're building a garage just down the street from the senior center, but it's just not across the street.

364
01:30:51,436 --> 01:30:59,762
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that there's some serious fear for our seniors that attend our senior center, that even down the road a little, it's just too far.

365
01:31:00,763 --> 01:31:03,465
[SPEAKER_05]: I know when we've worked together with, in

366
01:31:04,546 --> 01:31:19,284
[SPEAKER_05]: my full-time position talking about creative ways to support seniors during projects that were in neighborhoods where we were taking, in growing neighborhoods, and we looked at partnerships where

367
01:31:21,012 --> 01:31:41,200
[SPEAKER_05]: developers and our city work together to try to set up a shuttle service where even though it's only 100, 150 yards away, our seniors feel comfortable that when they park their car in the garage that they have a safe passage to the senior center.

368
01:31:42,300 --> 01:31:43,781
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's very important that

369
01:31:44,953 --> 01:31:46,414
[SPEAKER_05]: down the line we address that.

370
01:31:47,736 --> 01:31:55,746
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm excited that we're doing the project, but again, I err on the side of understanding the process a little bit better.

371
01:31:55,886 --> 01:32:02,214
[SPEAKER_05]: And when we look at, you know, how are we really using the whole corridor correctly?

372
01:32:02,394 --> 01:32:03,355
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we looking at

373
01:32:04,007 --> 01:32:08,272
[SPEAKER_05]: Did we, again, this could have already been done, but there's no information.

374
01:32:08,292 --> 01:32:15,280
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no, the community doesn't know that this has happened, but have we worked together with the Riverside Mall?

375
01:32:15,320 --> 01:32:20,426
[SPEAKER_05]: Have we talked about doing one project and working with them?

376
01:32:21,027 --> 01:32:26,890
[SPEAKER_05]: and relocating their buildings and restructuring all of Method Square, not just our three parcels.

377
01:32:28,471 --> 01:32:32,993
[SPEAKER_05]: And then again, the parking issue comes up a lot on the other side of the city.

378
01:32:33,474 --> 01:32:35,935
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that it's really not with transom or

379
01:32:36,435 --> 01:32:48,524
[SPEAKER_05]: that this project in particular, because we're excited that we're moving forward, because I think it's something that needs to be done, but there are a lot of questions that the average citizen still doesn't know.

380
01:32:48,944 --> 01:32:59,132
[SPEAKER_05]: All they hear is that we're taking three parcels in the city, in Method Square, and we're making this amazing transformation, but there's still so many questions.

381
01:32:59,732 --> 01:33:01,614
[SPEAKER_05]: And I hope the city does a better job

382
01:33:02,234 --> 01:33:06,397
[SPEAKER_05]: and making sure that people are educated and they understand the process.

383
01:33:06,477 --> 01:33:14,642
[SPEAKER_05]: Because as we've seen in the past over and over again, it's been a huge divide in our community when we just keep things in a bubble.

384
01:33:15,202 --> 01:33:23,548
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, like I said, I think being more transparent to the public, making sure that everybody understands that we've gone through certain processes.

385
01:33:24,008 --> 01:33:29,812
[SPEAKER_05]: And then again, my biggest ask and making sure that we're taking care of our senior citizens.

386
01:33:30,427 --> 01:33:35,008
[SPEAKER_05]: because to them right now, us talking about this is absolutely devastating to them.

387
01:33:35,928 --> 01:33:41,470
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people, the only piece of being part of a community is that senior center.

388
01:33:42,090 --> 01:33:49,171
[SPEAKER_05]: And just the fact that we're taking spots away that are right across the street have absolutely floored them.

389
01:33:49,992 --> 01:33:56,113
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure most of you heard, I hope, and you've talked to some of our seniors, but I think we need to do a better

390
01:33:57,642 --> 01:34:00,164
[SPEAKER_05]: better job of educating our community.

391
01:34:00,565 --> 01:34:05,649
[SPEAKER_05]: So we eliminate the negative discussion, the negative banter, which turns into the divide.

392
01:34:06,249 --> 01:34:22,383
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, this really wasn't to our presenter, but really to our city administration to really start doing their jobs a little bit better than what we've seen in the last major, um, concerns and issues that have been brought up to the city.

393
01:34:22,443 --> 01:34:23,524
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you, Mr. President.

394
01:34:24,504 --> 01:34:25,585
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

395
01:34:25,625 --> 01:34:26,286
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Lemming.

396
01:34:28,737 --> 01:34:45,872
[SPEAKER_08]: I do definitely agree with the need for a better communication, particularly with seniors who don't go on the internet, who really get most of their information through word of mouth.

397
01:34:46,172 --> 01:34:54,099
[SPEAKER_08]: I was glad during the presentation that Peter gave to counselors

398
01:34:55,378 --> 01:35:10,001
[SPEAKER_08]: a couple of counselors last week when I asked him about this specifically, he said that they do have plans to actually go into the senior center and hold these, hold information sessions about this, about this project in order to answer their questions.

399
01:35:10,061 --> 01:35:22,823
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I do know that counselors, Lazaro Calhoun and myself over the past year, year plus, we have gone to the senior center and we've had this exact conversation with many of the residents there where,

400
01:35:23,743 --> 01:35:26,446
[SPEAKER_08]: We're trying to, you know, we try to communicate with them.

401
01:35:27,407 --> 01:35:32,091
[SPEAKER_08]: Your parking will not actually be lost with this development.

402
01:35:32,131 --> 01:35:35,535
[SPEAKER_08]: This contains underground parking.

403
01:35:36,236 --> 01:35:47,227
[SPEAKER_08]: And with, you know, before the days when we actually had access to the developer behind this, I couldn't exactly give

404
01:35:47,915 --> 01:35:49,176
[SPEAKER_08]: too many details about it.

405
01:35:49,196 --> 01:36:03,465
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I think it would be very helpful to actually have the folks who are very familiar with the plans in gross detail, in granular detail, going there and talking to the seniors in particular.

406
01:36:03,625 --> 01:36:05,546
[SPEAKER_08]: And after that, posting very clear

407
01:36:11,510 --> 01:36:23,834
[SPEAKER_08]: plans and commentary on the website, on their website and on the city's website for those who do go on to the, who do get their information from the internet.

408
01:36:24,415 --> 01:36:27,576
[SPEAKER_08]: So the point is just multiple forms of communication.

409
01:36:27,596 --> 01:36:40,020
[SPEAKER_08]: And also to my, to my colleague's point about transportation for the seniors, I spoke with the mayor and I've been harping about it in our planning committees for a while now, which is a,

410
01:36:41,340 --> 01:36:44,862
[SPEAKER_08]: getting a transportation demand management program within the city.

411
01:36:44,882 --> 01:36:48,443
[SPEAKER_08]: And that is a part of our zoning plan.

412
01:36:48,623 --> 01:37:01,508
[SPEAKER_08]: Through something like that, we would be able to have developers put a portion of, put some funding towards buses that would then be able to serve the city.

413
01:37:02,648 --> 01:37:06,790
[SPEAKER_08]: These programs are very successful over in Everett where they do have

414
01:37:07,290 --> 01:37:16,554
[SPEAKER_08]: private buses paid for by a TMA that provide transportation within the area, but they don't go down to Medford because none of our developers are really a part of this.

415
01:37:16,614 --> 01:37:31,741
[SPEAKER_08]: So things like, um, a lot of what we're discussing, a lot of what's going through this council is, uh, uh, will address many of the concerns that residents bring to us if we just actually bring these projects through the completion.

416
01:37:32,201 --> 01:37:32,821
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you.

417
01:37:34,842 --> 01:37:35,422
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor.

418
01:37:35,442 --> 01:37:36,503
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, Councilor Lozaro.

419
01:37:38,777 --> 01:37:39,218
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

420
01:37:39,238 --> 01:37:41,300
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate the presentation.

421
01:37:43,603 --> 01:37:59,520
[SPEAKER_03]: And would also reiterate what Councilor Lemming alluded to, which is that members of this Council and members of the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee meet regularly at the Senior Center to talk about

422
01:38:01,822 --> 01:38:09,508
[SPEAKER_03]: all kinds of issues that come up and are of interest to seniors and people who go to the senior center with regularity.

423
01:38:10,388 --> 01:38:16,273
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe this RFP was chosen in particular because there is a parking garage included.

424
01:38:19,215 --> 01:38:28,602
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not directly next to, underneath, or on top of the senior center, but that I don't think that, I mean,

425
01:38:30,351 --> 01:38:37,933
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's an argument to be made that the city would be better served by a building that wasn't a parking garage, but what we have is a parking garage.

426
01:38:38,674 --> 01:38:42,855
[SPEAKER_03]: And if there was a compromise that had to be made, I think that this is a pretty good one.

427
01:38:46,276 --> 01:38:59,340
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think continued public engagement conversation is a good move by the mayor's administration,

428
01:39:00,048 --> 01:39:20,894
[SPEAKER_03]: by city councilors, I think we can absolutely invite Peter, other members of your team to have that conversation, but there are multiple stakeholders and we have a lot of people whose experience matters equally and a lot of people to make happy in the city.

429
01:39:21,554 --> 01:39:29,597
[SPEAKER_03]: And as we consider different people's needs, I think we have to continue to keep the conversation going and keep the lens of communication open.

430
01:39:30,337 --> 01:39:36,198
[SPEAKER_03]: and keep the invitations flowing and make sure that we're talking to everybody who has a vested interest in this.

431
01:39:36,878 --> 01:39:51,982
[SPEAKER_03]: Something I also wanted to mention is that the conversation about zoning in Medford Square, as Director Hunt mentioned, would really facilitate this project moving forward if we can move that forward sooner rather than later.

432
01:39:56,130 --> 01:40:01,112
[SPEAKER_03]: Peter, if you could mention what is the height of the tallest building in this plan?

433
01:40:01,132 --> 01:40:04,733
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't remember if that was mentioned in the presentation.

434
01:40:04,753 --> 01:40:09,555
[SPEAKER_04]: It's seven stories is the tallest building.

435
01:40:10,639 --> 01:40:11,099
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

436
01:40:12,020 --> 01:40:17,002
[SPEAKER_03]: So seven stories, I'm not sure if that was part of the zoning conversation, but it's not a short building.

437
01:40:17,802 --> 01:40:38,291
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think that's something to keep in mind as we continue our conversations about zoning in Medford Square, that in order to have the number of housing units that we're interested in accessing here, we should be keeping an eye toward continuing those conversations and making sure that that's something that's being prioritized.

438
01:40:38,992 --> 01:40:39,252
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

439
01:40:41,065 --> 01:40:42,167
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Zaro.

440
01:40:42,187 --> 01:40:46,213
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have any further questions or comments from members of the Council?

441
01:40:49,238 --> 01:40:53,785
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing none, Peter, is there anything else you'd like to add at this time about kind of next steps and where we go from here?

442
01:40:54,499 --> 01:41:09,286
[SPEAKER_04]: No, nothing in particular, Mr. President, but I do want to invite, I think I've, and I will similarly make sure that those that don't have my contact information look at, one of the benefits of us being local is that it's me, right?

443
01:41:09,446 --> 01:41:18,991
[SPEAKER_04]: And I want you all to feel, I want you to, as you hear from residents that we haven't touched base with, we've had a lot of great starts of conversations with the Chevalier, with the Council on Aging,

444
01:41:19,451 --> 01:41:20,472
[SPEAKER_04]: with a lot of the neighbors.

445
01:41:21,412 --> 01:41:27,636
[SPEAKER_04]: But we still need to get to know a lot of people and have a lot of conversation and really be open to the good idea.

446
01:41:28,537 --> 01:41:30,258
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're committed to do that.

447
01:41:30,378 --> 01:41:33,200
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll let you know when we can't do something.

448
01:41:34,420 --> 01:41:43,446
[SPEAKER_04]: But at the same time, we'll spend as much time as possible to make sure we hear the good idea and to bring to fruition those good ideas.

449
01:41:43,646 --> 01:41:46,588
[SPEAKER_04]: So thanks for having this conversation so early with us.

450
01:41:48,241 --> 01:41:48,401
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

451
01:41:48,461 --> 01:41:48,982
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Peter.

452
01:41:49,002 --> 01:42:03,552
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you could let us know, you know, when some of those informational meetings and, and engagement sessions are happening and can forward that to me and I'll send it to the clerk's office to share with members of the council so that they can be a part of those as well.

453
01:42:03,673 --> 01:42:04,273
[SPEAKER_09]: Please let us know.

454
01:42:04,293 --> 01:42:04,653
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.

455
01:42:05,834 --> 01:42:06,034
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

456
01:42:06,335 --> 01:42:10,898
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm going to turn it over to director Hunt for a final comment.

457
01:42:12,088 --> 01:42:13,148
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

458
01:42:13,228 --> 01:42:15,009
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to share one final comment.

459
01:42:15,789 --> 01:42:20,431
[SPEAKER_02]: As many of you know, we've worked with the State Mass Development on this project all along.

460
01:42:20,471 --> 01:42:24,952
[SPEAKER_02]: They've provided various supports, starting with the DIF, you might remember, in Medford Square.

461
01:42:24,972 --> 01:42:27,453
[SPEAKER_02]: That was to support some of this.

462
01:42:28,213 --> 01:42:33,235
[SPEAKER_02]: They helped us, they provided us with a consultant to write the RFP for this process.

463
01:42:33,635 --> 01:42:38,537
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've actually reached out to them for some real estate support and some additional consulting support.

464
01:42:39,037 --> 01:42:52,700
[SPEAKER_02]: that would include some project management and help specifically with—they wouldn't do outreach, but help us do—put stuff on the website, help us to figure out what should be on the website, what to be sharing when.

465
01:42:52,720 --> 01:43:00,082
[SPEAKER_02]: So I met with R&D consultants today with Mass Development, and I do think that we will be able to bring them on

466
01:43:00,582 --> 01:43:06,827
[SPEAKER_02]: very quickly that there would be funding through this project to help pay for consulting and legal fees.

467
01:43:07,288 --> 01:43:15,894
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I did just want to share with that that we are likely, if everything goes smoothly, to bring them on board in the next couple of weeks.

468
01:43:15,955 --> 01:43:20,198
[SPEAKER_02]: I was hoping by next week, but I was informed that the state could not turn around a contract that quickly.

469
01:43:21,979 --> 01:43:26,763
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyhow, hopefully that will help with some of the robust outreach that people are looking for.

470
01:43:27,344 --> 01:43:28,665
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you very much this evening.

471
01:43:34,135 --> 01:43:34,895
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Director Hunt.

472
01:43:36,656 --> 01:43:40,358
[SPEAKER_09]: I will go to the podium for public participation.

473
01:43:42,339 --> 01:43:43,760
[SPEAKER_09]: Name and address for the record.

474
01:43:44,720 --> 01:43:46,241
[SPEAKER_09]: And you'll have three minutes.

475
01:43:48,842 --> 01:43:49,983
[SPEAKER_09]: One second there, Andy.

476
01:43:58,167 --> 01:43:59,588
[SPEAKER_09]: That mic's not working.

477
01:44:03,392 --> 01:44:05,033
[SPEAKER_09]: Not sure why it's not working.

478
01:44:08,094 --> 01:44:09,455
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, one second, Andy, hold on.

479
01:44:09,495 --> 01:44:12,356
[SPEAKER_09]: The more you tap it, I think the more trouble we may have.

480
01:44:12,376 --> 01:44:18,319
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not able to turn it on.

481
01:44:24,021 --> 01:44:28,403
[SPEAKER_09]: Jim, could you maybe reset it and Emily could we use your microphone for a minute?

482
01:44:39,031 --> 01:44:40,453
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, now I'm having trouble with that one.

483
01:44:40,754 --> 01:44:41,174
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

484
01:44:49,307 --> 01:44:52,031
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, no one will be able to hear you on the recording.

485
01:45:06,424 --> 01:45:07,565
[SPEAKER_09]: Give us just a minute here.

486
01:45:20,630 --> 01:45:24,552
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Angel Castanetti, Cushman Street, East Medford Mass.

487
01:45:25,212 --> 01:45:27,733
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, council.

488
01:45:28,574 --> 01:45:29,794
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the presentation.

489
01:45:29,814 --> 01:45:31,275
[SPEAKER_00]: I was not aware of this.

490
01:45:32,015 --> 01:45:34,456
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to play devil's advocate while I'm here.

491
01:45:36,863 --> 01:45:41,887
[SPEAKER_00]: Does the presenter know how many total parking spots we have with the three parcels as we speak?

492
01:45:45,609 --> 01:45:49,192
[SPEAKER_09]: Andy, if you could finish your comment and then we'll see what answers we can get.

493
01:45:49,312 --> 01:45:54,636
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what would be the parking spots after the three building development?

494
01:45:57,298 --> 01:45:58,199
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, what would be the what?

495
01:45:59,600 --> 01:46:06,445
[SPEAKER_00]: How many parking spots do we have in all these three parcels and how many will we have after this proposed development is completed?

496
01:46:07,458 --> 01:46:08,179
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

497
01:46:08,359 --> 01:46:09,059
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll write that down.

498
01:46:09,500 --> 01:46:10,541
[SPEAKER_09]: Anything else you want to say on this?

499
01:46:11,602 --> 01:46:11,922
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

500
01:46:12,903 --> 01:46:16,066
[SPEAKER_00]: How many present senior parking spots do we have presently?

501
01:46:23,972 --> 01:46:27,876
[SPEAKER_00]: And how many will we have in the future after development?

502
01:46:34,751 --> 01:46:37,313
[SPEAKER_00]: I have one last one, should I continue speaking to you?

503
01:46:38,033 --> 01:46:38,934
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, yeah, if you could.

504
01:46:39,054 --> 01:46:39,274
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

505
01:46:39,834 --> 01:46:43,557
[SPEAKER_00]: And those grocery store right there, is it really a really good idea?

506
01:46:43,577 --> 01:46:48,640
[SPEAKER_00]: There used to be a grocery store here on the left side of Transit Street.

507
01:46:49,340 --> 01:46:52,122
[SPEAKER_00]: It was there many years ago, and it was a decent size.

508
01:46:52,262 --> 01:46:54,604
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember the actual company name.

509
01:46:57,526 --> 01:47:02,769
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was wondering, if there's a grocery store there, where would the customers park?

510
01:47:03,723 --> 01:47:05,245
[SPEAKER_00]: And how many spots would they have?

511
01:47:05,465 --> 01:47:06,906
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it needed parking?

512
01:47:07,066 --> 01:47:08,308
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to pay for parking.

513
01:47:09,369 --> 01:47:11,110
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the only three questions I have today.

514
01:47:12,171 --> 01:47:12,732
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks, Andy.

515
01:47:13,372 --> 01:47:15,354
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll work on getting some answers to those questions.

516
01:47:15,374 --> 01:47:18,938
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

517
01:47:23,022 --> 01:47:27,546
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing no further public comment and no further questions from councilors, is there a motion?

518
01:47:31,255 --> 01:47:33,617
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion to adjourn by Councilor Callahan, seconded by.

519
01:47:34,198 --> 01:47:35,519
[SPEAKER_09]: Seconded by Councilor Zaro.

520
01:47:36,079 --> 01:47:37,280
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

521
01:47:43,005 --> 01:47:43,846
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Callahan?

522
01:47:45,548 --> 01:47:46,608
[SPEAKER_07]: Vice President Collins?

523
01:47:47,309 --> 01:47:47,529
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

524
01:47:49,491 --> 01:47:50,252
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Zaro?

525
01:47:50,292 --> 01:47:50,352
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

526
01:47:51,613 --> 01:47:52,233
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Lemming?

527
01:47:52,253 --> 01:47:52,313
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

528
01:47:53,635 --> 01:47:54,455
