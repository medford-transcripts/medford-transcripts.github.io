1
00:01:47,011 --> 00:01:50,072
to roll call member Rousseau.

2
00:01:51,272 --> 00:01:51,832
Member Graham.

3
00:01:52,352 --> 00:01:52,612
Here.

4
00:01:53,553 --> 00:01:54,133
Member Hayes.

5
00:01:54,473 --> 00:01:54,713
Here.

6
00:01:55,393 --> 00:01:55,953
Member Kretz.

7
00:01:56,353 --> 00:01:56,473
Here.

8
00:01:57,293 --> 00:01:58,134
Member McLaughlin.

9
00:01:58,434 --> 00:01:58,694
Here.

10
00:01:59,374 --> 00:02:00,114
Member Mustone.

11
00:02:00,654 --> 00:02:00,894
Here.

12
00:02:01,935 --> 00:02:02,795
Member Rousseau here.

13
00:02:02,855 --> 00:02:03,615
Mayor Longo Kern.

14
00:02:03,855 --> 00:02:04,295
Present.

15
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:06,276
Seven present, zero absent.

16
00:02:06,436 --> 00:02:07,336
If we all may rise.

17
00:02:07,856 --> 00:02:09,396
Are there any student representatives on?

18
00:02:10,097 --> 00:02:11,137
No student representatives.

19
00:02:11,177 --> 00:02:13,017
If we all may rise to salute the flag.

20
00:02:13,037 --> 00:02:15,778
I pledge allegiance to the flag

21
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:25,682
the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

22
00:02:28,063 --> 00:02:34,984
We have the consent agenda, bills and payrolls, regular school committee meeting minutes from April 4th, 2022.

23
00:02:35,464 --> 00:02:36,164
Motion to approve.

24
00:02:36,344 --> 00:02:37,245
Motion for approval.

25
00:02:37,285 --> 00:02:39,925
Member Hayes, do you have a question before the roll is called?

26
00:02:40,665 --> 00:02:44,146
I did have a question, just that my name was left off of the attendance.

27
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:50,961
Okay, we need to just make that amendment to the minutes from 4.4.22, add Member Hayes as present at that meeting.

28
00:02:51,981 --> 00:02:55,463
Motion for approval by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Kretz.

29
00:02:56,763 --> 00:02:57,664
All those in favor?

30
00:02:58,284 --> 00:02:58,404
Aye.

31
00:02:59,264 --> 00:03:00,145
All those opposed?

32
00:03:00,925 --> 00:03:01,986
The minutes are approved.

33
00:03:02,986 --> 00:03:04,767
Number four, reports of subcommittees.

34
00:03:06,668 --> 00:03:07,848
We do not have any.

35
00:03:08,548 --> 00:03:09,289
Welcome, everybody.

36
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:14,411
I'll just let everybody sit down before you go to your... Come on in, take a seat.

37
00:03:31,934 --> 00:03:32,821
Oh, I love you.

38
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,116
Good evening.

39
00:04:43,058 --> 00:04:52,530
I'd like to open my remarks this evening by acknowledging that many members of the community are here to voice their opinions and concerns about a personnel matter.

40
00:04:53,553 --> 00:05:04,644
In addition, I have received email communication as well, and I have responded that I am legally obligated to maintain confidentiality when it comes to personnel records.

41
00:05:05,484 --> 00:05:16,034
All human resource personnel matters are confidential, and neither I nor any member of the school committee are able to respond to any questions or comments regarding personnel.

42
00:05:16,755 --> 00:05:18,637
I thank you in advance for your understanding.

43
00:05:20,646 --> 00:05:21,606
The COVID update.

44
00:05:22,407 --> 00:05:36,753
This morning, the Medford Public Schools Health Services Department notified our team that events involving Medford students that occurred outside of school were likely places of COVID-19 transmission.

45
00:05:38,193 --> 00:05:47,217
Due to the extenuating circumstances surrounding these events, our team of school nurses have engaged in contact tracing specific to these events.

46
00:05:48,993 --> 00:06:00,285
We do have evidence of a slight uptick in positivity concentrated at our secondary level, and we will continue to monitor these events to defend against any type of surge.

47
00:06:01,306 --> 00:06:10,516
I remind you as always to participate in the DESI-sponsored rapid testing program to help to continue to put the pandemic behind us.

48
00:06:12,102 --> 00:06:24,894
Additionally, on Wednesdays here at City Hall, there will be vaccination clinics happening in our Board of Health on Wednesdays from two to six, this Wednesday, April 13th.

49
00:06:25,894 --> 00:06:33,762
And the shots that are available are Moderna for 18 plus and Pfizer for 12 plus.

50
00:06:34,863 --> 00:06:38,065
First shot, second shot and booster shots are available.

51
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:42,290
Only 25 people have registered thus far.

52
00:06:43,671 --> 00:06:49,558
Please pre-register so that your medication can be reserved.

53
00:06:51,633 --> 00:06:54,354
Also, history is all around us.

54
00:06:55,835 --> 00:07:10,761
As we come upon the Patriots Day holiday, we know Medford played an integral role in the American Revolution and is actually mentioned in the now famous Longfellow poem, The Midnight Ride of Paul Revere.

55
00:07:12,076 --> 00:07:25,323
We remember how groups of minutemen came from neighboring towns to line up at Concord and Lexington to face at the time, the strongest empire in the world, the British Army.

56
00:07:26,484 --> 00:07:31,227
This description sounds eerily similar to what is happening now in the Ukraine.

57
00:07:32,728 --> 00:07:40,513
Colonial America wanted to live in freedom from Britain, and clearly Ukraine would like to remain free from Russian influence.

58
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:46,577
Lessons from the past can often teach us lessons about the present and future.

59
00:07:48,098 --> 00:07:49,699
History is all around us.

60
00:07:50,820 --> 00:08:00,527
Last week, we were able to witness the appointment of the first African-American woman, Judge Katanja Brown Jackson, to the United States Supreme Court.

61
00:08:01,758 --> 00:08:08,003
Judge Jackson is the first, but hopefully not the last, African-American woman to grace the court.

62
00:08:08,844 --> 00:08:15,729
Her appointment may have taken 232 years, but as Judge Jackson stated, we made it.

63
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:19,953
Our children see that in America, anything is possible.

64
00:08:21,676 --> 00:08:32,604
I'd like to extend special congratulations to the Medford High School's Drama Club for their outstanding presentation this past weekend of Legally Blonde.

65
00:08:33,584 --> 00:08:48,675
Special thanks to Mr. Shankady, Mr. Brauch, Mr. McLaughlin, Elvin Keith from Spotlight, the Votes Graphic Arts Program, the parents and backstage crew for helping the student actors present this performance.

66
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:56,737
The arts have been especially hit hard by the pandemic, and it was wonderful to see the students shine in this production.

67
00:08:58,618 --> 00:09:06,821
Additionally, the Medford Vocational Technical High School opened its program to the public for the first time in over two years.

68
00:09:07,581 --> 00:09:10,482
Parents and students were able to see the shops in action.

69
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:21,555
especially the shops that have been moved to new spaces, cosmetology, electrical, robotics and engineering, and the school store.

70
00:09:21,575 --> 00:09:28,240
I know a number of eighth grade students really were impressed by the offerings at our vocational school.

71
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:34,764
Thank you to member Hayes and member Kretz for attending the event last week.

72
00:09:36,235 --> 00:09:45,181
As you are aware, April vacation begins April 15th, as the schools are closed this Friday, Good Friday, and the following week.

73
00:09:47,282 --> 00:09:57,029
I know the mayor has planned Patriot's Day activities for the 18th, and the Chamber of Commerce will be hosting a pancake breakfast that morning at St.

74
00:09:57,069 --> 00:10:02,072
Joseph's Hall from 8 to 10 a.m., from 9 to 11 a.m.

75
00:10:02,292 --> 00:10:02,632
at St.

76
00:10:02,672 --> 00:10:03,353
Joseph's Hall.

77
00:10:05,697 --> 00:10:09,540
Patriots Day reminds us of the Boston Marathon bombings.

78
00:10:10,641 --> 00:10:17,948
We lost a former student, Crystal Campbell, who was killed while waiting for her friends to cross the finish line.

79
00:10:19,468 --> 00:10:31,596
The Mustang Girls softball team organized the annual Crystal Campbell Memorial Softball Tournament in her memory, with proceeds benefiting a scholarship in her name.

80
00:10:32,657 --> 00:10:37,280
The tournament returns to Columbus Park on Saturday, April 23rd and Sunday, April 24th.

81
00:10:40,282 --> 00:10:44,324
There will be raffles, a 50-50, and a concession stand.

82
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:52,948
The other teams participating include Bullerica High School, Arlington Catholic High School, and Swanscott High School.

83
00:10:53,728 --> 00:10:55,769
Come out and cheer on our Mustangs!

84
00:10:57,697 --> 00:11:14,585
With April being National Autism Awareness Month, the brand new Mustangs Boys Volleyball Team will host an autism awareness game against Malden on Wednesday, April 27th at 4 p.m.

85
00:11:15,085 --> 00:11:15,946
in the high school gym.

86
00:11:17,389 --> 00:11:18,910
T-shirts are being sold now.

87
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:24,054
The day of the game, there will be a bake sale and a 50-50 raffle.

88
00:11:24,074 --> 00:11:30,138
All proceeds will be donated to the Medford High School Unified Sports Program.

89
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:36,223
So there are also a number of holidays that are taking place this month in April.

90
00:11:37,893 --> 00:11:41,534
Ram Navami A. It's a Hindu celebration.

91
00:11:41,554 --> 00:11:44,456
It was celebrated yesterday, April 10th.

92
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:47,677
Passover is April 15th.

93
00:11:49,037 --> 00:11:51,718
Easter, this Sunday, April 17th.

94
00:11:52,459 --> 00:11:54,480
And Orthodox Easter is April 24th.

95
00:11:56,232 --> 00:12:06,363
And with a number of COVID regulations lifted, I'm sure many family and friends will be able to gather together safely and enjoy their time celebrating together.

96
00:12:07,464 --> 00:12:11,048
To our Hindu families who celebrate Ram Navami,

97
00:12:11,949 --> 00:12:18,715
or the birthday of the God Ram, we wish you divine blessings of Sri Ram along with peace and prosperity.

98
00:12:18,735 --> 00:12:32,046
To our Jewish families who celebrate Passover, which commemorates the emancipation of the Israelites from slavery, we wish you a happy Pesach, which is Passover in Hebrew.

99
00:12:33,047 --> 00:12:37,731
to our Christian families who celebrate Easter and Orthodox Easter.

100
00:12:38,231 --> 00:12:41,654
We wish you a joyful celebration.

101
00:12:42,474 --> 00:12:46,797
Wishing everyone a safe, restful and enjoyable April vacation.

102
00:12:48,579 --> 00:12:49,780
Thank you, Dr. Edward Vincent.

103
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:55,524
Number two, we have report on Massachusetts School Building Authority MSBA application.

104
00:12:56,064 --> 00:12:59,367
Mr. David Murphy, assistant superintendent of finance and operations.

105
00:13:00,248 --> 00:13:00,668
Mr. Murphy.

106
00:13:01,442 --> 00:13:01,962
Thank you, Mayor.

107
00:13:02,363 --> 00:13:03,603
Good evening, members of the school committee.

108
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:14,730
So this, tonight's report is a continuation of the initial presentation that you received on January 24th, and then a follow-up presentation that you received on March 21st.

109
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:27,738
And you'll recall that on March 21st, the administration reported that after a consultation with a variety of other districts who have been through MSBA projects, as well as consultants who have helped shepherd some of those projects through,

110
00:13:28,425 --> 00:13:48,645
and an analysis of our own data with respect to our flagship school, Medford High School, we determined that between the two MSBA programs for which the application window had opened on January 28th and would conclude later in the spring, that we would be submitting a statement of interest under the core program for Medford High School.

111
00:13:49,145 --> 00:13:57,290
And I do want to just provide a little bit of context for that because I know this is an important issue that has received over the years a lot of attention in the community.

112
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:01,032
And it's an issue that a lot of people rightfully feel very strongly about.

113
00:14:01,732 --> 00:14:14,299
Our decision to submit a statement of interest and our request to you to authorize us to do so is not an indication that there will be wrecking balls pulling up to Medford High School imminently.

114
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:17,841
What it is, though, it's an opportunity for the Medford public schools

115
00:14:18,294 --> 00:14:25,338
to potentially enter the MSBA pipeline of potential projects, either new construction or significant rehabilitation.

116
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:43,847
And then it gives us the opportunity later on this year and in succeeding years to go through all of the very extensive due diligence process that the Massachusetts School Building Authority affords to communities that are looking at projects like this to make a determination as to what is in the best interest of the Medford community.

117
00:14:44,605 --> 00:14:51,371
That is, uh, it is, we are months away from a determination as to whether or not we would even be accepted into the pipeline.

118
00:14:51,812 --> 00:14:56,896
And we would be years away from any, uh, determinations being made by the, by the community.

119
00:14:57,317 --> 00:15:03,122
And ultimately it is a determination that will be made by the community at large as to whether to move forward with this, with this type of project.

120
00:15:03,222 --> 00:15:08,947
So, um, the stage that we're at right now is that we are, we're preparing our statement of interest to submit prior to the April 28th deadline.

121
00:15:10,257 --> 00:15:23,089
to sort of cut to the chase for tonight's presentation, that requires, among some other procedural steps, a vote of the governing body of the school system to authorize the superintendent to submit that statement of interest to the core program.

122
00:15:23,109 --> 00:15:33,079
The statement of interest will detail, both from an operational perspective and an educational perspective, why we believe Medford High School has reached a point in which a core program

123
00:15:33,579 --> 00:15:45,793
Rehabilitation or new construction would be necessary and you'll see in the memo that I provided to you a summary of those that are essentially bucketed into two categories and that just for again for background purposes

124
00:15:46,206 --> 00:15:51,490
There are eight priority areas identified under the law governing the MSBA core projects.

125
00:15:52,211 --> 00:15:57,255
We've identified two that we think are specifically appropriate to the state of Medford High School.

126
00:15:57,855 --> 00:16:02,378
The first, known as Priority Five, deals with some of the operational deficiencies.

127
00:16:02,819 --> 00:16:15,749
And you'll see, again, in the memo, that relates to antiquated windows and eight-faction system, electrical systems, plumbing systems, all of which, and this is a term that you'll likely be hearing

128
00:16:16,249 --> 00:16:21,238
frequently throughout this process have outlived their useful lifespan or are no longer

129
00:16:23,075 --> 00:16:25,737
There is a phrase that you'll hear frequently, but I just, I messed it up.

130
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:32,443
So they've outlived its useful life expectancy, and in many cases are no longer operable.

131
00:16:32,543 --> 00:16:43,533
So that has to do with wildly fluctuating temperatures and inability to control the temperature in a way that we would prefer to make the learning conditions conducive.

132
00:16:43,553 --> 00:16:49,538
And we know that that certainly has an exacerbated impact on some of our more vulnerable student populations.

133
00:16:50,338 --> 00:16:53,321
All of this will be detailed in the statement of interest.

134
00:16:53,601 --> 00:16:57,704
And then in priority seven, which is the secondary, the second category,

135
00:16:58,534 --> 00:17:05,418
That's addressing some of the academic and vocational implications to a building with the type of deteriorating infrastructure that Medford High School has.

136
00:17:05,898 --> 00:17:09,059
So all of that's going to be bucketed, put into our statement of interest.

137
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:15,362
We've had some constructive conversations with representatives from the MSBA already.

138
00:17:16,003 --> 00:17:24,667
That's in no way an indication that our application will be received favorably, but it's certainly, we think, a positive sign that we're on their radar.

139
00:17:25,408 --> 00:17:37,339
Some of the representatives that we've spoken with have actually been involved in some of the previous tours of Medford High School, but the last official tour was several years ago, and we think we have a compelling case that can be made.

140
00:17:37,439 --> 00:17:42,284
So on the screen in front of you is the language of the motion that we are requesting.

141
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:50,091
You've already received this in writing, but I'll just read it very, very briefly, or as quickly as I can.

142
00:17:50,131 --> 00:17:51,012
So this is a motion

143
00:17:51,499 --> 00:18:05,790
to authorize the superintendents of schools to submit a statement of interest on behalf of Medford High School to the core program of the Massachusetts School Building Authority prior to April 20th, 2022, emphasizing the operational and educational implications of challenges posed by the infrastructure of Medford High School.

144
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:20,921
Specifically, the superintendent is authorized to address the need to potentially replace, renovate, or modernize the school facility systems, including but not limited to roofs, windows, boilers, heating and ventilation systems, and the need to increase energy conservation and decrease energy-related costs in the school facility.

145
00:18:21,459 --> 00:18:36,658
And further, the superintendent is authorized to articulate the academic and instructional obstacles posed by the school's current infrastructure and the need to potentially provide for the replacement of or addition to any obsolete facilities in order to provide for a full range of academic and vocational programs for students of Medford High School.

146
00:18:37,219 --> 00:18:43,404
As you can probably tell, the language of the motion is lifted from the statutory language and those two statutory priorities.

147
00:18:43,464 --> 00:18:54,773
And this is just an attempt by the administration to put us in the most favorable position possible to submit that statement of interest and hopefully be received favorably by the Massachusetts School Building Authority.

148
00:18:55,293 --> 00:19:01,138
So with that, I'm happy to take your questions and would ask you to entertain that motion so that we can submit that statement of interest.

149
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,342
Member Kress, if you just want to turn on your microphone, please.

150
00:19:07,242 --> 00:19:09,503
Sorry, I always get them mixed up, sorry.

151
00:19:09,543 --> 00:19:23,809
Yeah, so I'm making a motion to approve the language in the MSBA statement as stated so that the superintendent can submit the statement of interest on behalf of Memphis High School to the MSBA.

152
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:25,310
Thank you, Member Gretz.

153
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:27,691
Seconded by Member McLaughlin.

154
00:19:27,771 --> 00:19:29,072
Roll call, please.

155
00:19:29,712 --> 00:19:29,952
Mayor.

156
00:19:30,492 --> 00:19:31,413
Member Rousseau.

157
00:19:33,154 --> 00:19:34,494
Just want to turn on your microphone, please.

158
00:19:34,534 --> 00:19:34,815
Sorry.

159
00:19:35,195 --> 00:19:39,596
Will we be discussing the presentation after we take the roll call, though, or will we be moving on?

160
00:19:39,616 --> 00:19:40,996
Do you want questions before?

161
00:19:42,977 --> 00:19:44,557
Questions before we call the roll?

162
00:19:44,817 --> 00:19:45,258
That'd be great.

163
00:19:45,298 --> 00:19:45,658
Thank you.

164
00:19:46,398 --> 00:19:58,802
I read the draft findings, and there were some pretty startling and, frankly, upsetting parts to it that we use.

165
00:20:00,956 --> 00:20:05,401
more than three times as much energy than we would need to to be considered net zero.

166
00:20:05,421 --> 00:20:12,329
77% more energy than the average for the entire United States per square foot.

167
00:20:14,432 --> 00:20:18,677
And then, honestly, the most upsetting part was that

168
00:20:19,315 --> 00:20:45,780
it will be at a minimum $10 million just to get rid of all of the hazardous materials that our kids are, I realize not all of them are exposed, but to get rid of the PCBs, lead paint, asbestos, I think that $10 million is an awful lot of money, and that does not include the labor or replacement costs of anything that we actually would be mitigating.

169
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,040
So I,

170
00:20:49,895 --> 00:20:58,737
I'm a little upset that this is where we are, that we're multiple years away from having a building that does not have that stuff removed.

171
00:21:00,997 --> 00:21:04,638
It's really hard to deal with that.

172
00:21:04,658 --> 00:21:14,220
So I just, I obviously support this and I'm wondering when we can expect to get the final draft, not the final draft, but the final report.

173
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:15,050
Sure.

174
00:21:15,831 --> 00:21:17,131
Thank you for your question, Mr. Rousseau.

175
00:21:17,171 --> 00:21:32,179
So the report that Mr. Rousseau is referencing is a report by the vendor who we retained to complete the facility condition assessment, which is a preliminary step in order to provide the technical analysis necessary to provide the most, hopefully provide the most competitive statement of interest.

176
00:21:32,299 --> 00:21:39,462
And so I think with respect to the final draft, certainly before April 28th, and I think my hope would be within the next week or so,

177
00:21:41,055 --> 00:21:50,737
The draft report, which you have, as you mentioned, does highlight a number of very concerning challenges that we're facing in the building.

178
00:21:51,077 --> 00:21:52,857
I wouldn't say any of them are particularly surprising.

179
00:21:53,718 --> 00:22:04,320
And with respect to the hazardous materials, I referenced this in the memo, but I just want to say it publicly and as clearly as possible, the report does not indicate that there are hazardous materials to which students and staff are exposed to.

180
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:10,321
What it references is that due to the age of the building and particularly the era in which it was constructed,

181
00:22:10,819 --> 00:22:25,887
to deconstruct it, which would be necessary for a significant building rehabilitation, would have significant abatement costs that would be associated with it due to the hazardous materials that are essentially embedded in the building that you could be exposed to if that type of construction were to take place.

182
00:22:26,307 --> 00:22:33,991
So I want to be very clear that we do not have a report that indicates that there are hazardous materials to which students and staff are currently exposed.

183
00:22:35,572 --> 00:22:49,281
That being said, to your point, that's why you don't want to be in a 50-plus-year-old building, because that's not the type of infrastructure that you want to be having school in day in and day out, which is why we're pursuing this path.

184
00:22:49,922 --> 00:23:02,570
With regard to the energy efficiency, I think you're right that one of the more glaring pieces of narrative in the report that will certainly be a significant part of our statement of interest is this idea that we're expending 77% more energy

185
00:23:05,793 --> 00:23:07,199
than the typical high school.

186
00:23:09,215 --> 00:23:13,917
I don't want to walk away from those numbers at all, because I think they helped make our case, and I think they're highly favorable.

187
00:23:14,677 --> 00:23:19,638
But I would just say that with all data points of that nature, the framing of it is really important.

188
00:23:20,038 --> 00:23:26,321
And so we have a very large high school that was constructed for a student population significantly larger than the one that we currently have.

189
00:23:27,261 --> 00:23:37,064
In the last year, we have done a significant amount of repairs to improve our HVAC systems, and in a lot of cases, brought systems back online that I've

190
00:23:37,544 --> 00:23:39,825
as it's my understanding, have not been online in several years.

191
00:23:40,325 --> 00:23:49,407
In doing so, we've watched our utilities expenses go up significantly and our energy efficiency has declined in turn.

192
00:23:50,907 --> 00:24:01,530
So it's sort of the other end of the presentation that I made before you several times last year about how we were bringing all our HVAC systems back online and improving our

193
00:24:02,074 --> 00:24:12,904
air exchange quality, which we did, but in doing so, we've made our building even more energy inefficient, which is part of one of several reasons that we feel it's necessary to pursue this course.

194
00:24:13,365 --> 00:24:13,705
Thank you.

195
00:24:13,885 --> 00:24:23,775
I signed the bills, as you know, and the warrants, and every single week I'm signing $10,000 plus electric bills, and it's a bit

196
00:24:24,554 --> 00:24:35,729
I mean, I don't know what a bill should be for such infrastructure, but it doesn't take a rocket scientist to realize this is not an appropriate and lowers the answer, but a lot lower.

197
00:24:35,869 --> 00:24:39,214
I mean, I just couldn't even believe how big those are every single week.

198
00:24:39,847 --> 00:24:51,769
Yeah, we're a 600,000 plus square foot building, a typical comprehensive high school, inclusive of our vocational programming, based on other buildings about the size of ours and size of the student population.

199
00:24:51,789 --> 00:24:56,530
And again, Chapter 74 programs really are the distinguishing variable, making us a comprehensive high school.

200
00:24:57,771 --> 00:25:02,812
You're more likely looking at a 400 to 500,000 square building, possibly even smaller.

201
00:25:04,755 --> 00:25:15,043
There are upsides to having a building of our size and there's some flexibility that we can do, but it's not in keeping with the sort of contemporary principles of the School of Instruction.

202
00:25:15,463 --> 00:25:15,783
Thank you.

203
00:25:20,907 --> 00:25:24,250
Motion by Member Kretz, seconded by Member McLaughlin.

204
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:33,597
Before the roll is called, I just want to thank you, Mr. Murphy and the superintendent and the team for all your work on this and making sure our kids get the best at MHS, hopefully sooner than later.

205
00:25:34,198 --> 00:25:35,218
If you may call the roll, please.

206
00:25:35,378 --> 00:25:35,718
Certainly.

207
00:25:35,898 --> 00:25:36,399
Member Graham?

208
00:25:36,679 --> 00:25:36,919
Yes.

209
00:25:37,999 --> 00:25:38,479
Member Hayes?

210
00:25:39,019 --> 00:25:39,239
Yes.

211
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:41,320
Yes.

212
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:44,280
Member McLaughlin?

213
00:25:44,701 --> 00:25:44,981
Yes.

214
00:25:45,561 --> 00:25:46,201
Member Mustone?

215
00:25:46,341 --> 00:25:46,561
Yes.

216
00:25:47,421 --> 00:25:48,021
Member Verso?

217
00:25:48,061 --> 00:25:48,301
Yes.

218
00:25:48,402 --> 00:25:49,122
Mayor Longo?

219
00:25:49,362 --> 00:25:49,582
Yes.

220
00:25:49,642 --> 00:25:51,122
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

221
00:25:51,202 --> 00:25:52,002
The paper passes.

222
00:25:52,523 --> 00:25:52,843
Thank you.

223
00:25:54,203 --> 00:25:57,584
Number three, we have report on budget survey for fiscal year 23.

224
00:25:57,684 --> 00:26:01,005
Mr. David Murphy, assistant superintendent of finance and operations.

225
00:26:02,145 --> 00:26:02,505
Thank you, Mayor.

226
00:26:03,411 --> 00:26:30,715
So turning our attention to both our quarterly budget update with regard to FY22 and our planning for FY23, we have a deck that was circulated to you this afternoon, and I'll just walk through the beginning of it with respect to some updates that I provide you each time we do our quarterly budget update, but again, to make sure that we have context and putting the sort of

227
00:26:31,255 --> 00:26:32,856
appropriate parameters around the conversation.

228
00:26:33,217 --> 00:26:38,280
So our FY22 operating budget is $67.4 million.

229
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:43,304
I will also add the caveat, as I do each time we talk about the budget, that these are estimates.

230
00:26:44,645 --> 00:26:53,631
I didn't put the squiggly line next to each and every number on the presentation, but I'm assuming that at this point, you can imagine that it's there because it usually is.

231
00:26:53,651 --> 00:26:56,253
So $67.4 million is our FY22 operating budget.

232
00:26:56,273 --> 00:26:57,394
That's inclusive of the $3.7 million

233
00:26:58,965 --> 00:27:01,447
of ARPA funding that was incorporated into the budget.

234
00:27:02,028 --> 00:27:11,376
And then as I reported to you in our quarter two update, our estimated ESSER expenditure currently for FY22 is $1.4 million.

235
00:27:11,437 --> 00:27:16,882
That's some staffing positions that are specifically designed to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on students.

236
00:27:17,282 --> 00:27:24,829
That's extended day programming, particularly in math at the elementary school level, as well as some summer programming and school vacation programming that we've run.

237
00:27:25,736 --> 00:27:32,719
to try to again mitigate that instructional disruption that we know students have faced as a result of the pandemic.

238
00:27:32,759 --> 00:27:39,902
So that number is important for a few pieces of information that I will provide in just a moment.

239
00:27:41,463 --> 00:27:43,765
we can go to the timeline slide next.

240
00:27:43,785 --> 00:28:07,905
So this is, there have been some adjustments in the timeline that I've communicated to you, but our general structure of taking the basic data that you received this evening, and then having a series of budget hearings focused on our four, the pillars of our FY23 budget, specifically equity and supports for most vulnerable and high need students, technology utilization and how,

241
00:28:09,226 --> 00:28:14,748
The strategic investments that we've made over the last several years are going to be continued in FY23 and beyond.

242
00:28:15,408 --> 00:28:22,411
Our organizational structure, which is to the point that was made by multiple committee members with regard to the budget being an opportunity.

243
00:28:23,104 --> 00:28:27,385
to sort of provide as much transparency into the school district as possible in our operations.

244
00:28:27,765 --> 00:28:39,847
And then the COVID mitigation budget hearing will focus both on the ESSER funding priorities, as well as the other funding priorities that are specific to rebuilding the instructional infrastructure that we know was damaged during the pandemic.

245
00:28:40,347 --> 00:28:48,429
And then we're going to provide an additional date for some miscellaneous priorities that may come up in the course of the discussion of those four hearings.

246
00:28:49,489 --> 00:29:00,392
Just to, again, go through the sort of timeline and the sequence of events, after the administration and superintendent make the recommendation with regard to a budgetary request, the school committee will vote to make that request.

247
00:29:00,432 --> 00:29:02,973
That request will make its way to city hall, to the mayor's office.

248
00:29:03,373 --> 00:29:12,035
The mayor will then make a recommendation to the city council, and then the city council will make an appropriation to the school department, which the school committee will then come back and take a vote to adopt.

249
00:29:13,076 --> 00:29:17,957
The point that I've made every time I've made one of these budget presentations, and you'll, I think, hopefully remember it from last year,

250
00:29:18,407 --> 00:29:24,171
The school administration understands our responsibility to provide for a variety of contingencies with respect to the budget.

251
00:29:24,511 --> 00:29:36,580
So the initial number that you are presented with will be based on a factual assessment of the needs and priorities of the school department and what we believe is necessary to create the optimal conditions for learning.

252
00:29:37,045 --> 00:29:48,392
We also understand that the municipal government, the city council, as well as the mayor have priorities citywide that need to be addressed and we will be prepared to implement whatever budget is ultimately appropriated.

253
00:29:48,512 --> 00:29:59,878
And so I know that that part sometimes has led to some confusion, but I just want to reiterate again, we're going to present a budget to you based on the school department's priorities and what we believe is in the best interest of students.

254
00:30:00,318 --> 00:30:04,521
But at the same time, we fully understand that we are a constituent part of this community.

255
00:30:04,921 --> 00:30:07,465
that the mayor and the city council have to balance those priorities.

256
00:30:07,845 --> 00:30:14,454
And when that appropriation is made, the school administration will be prepared to implement the budget as it is ultimately appropriated.

257
00:30:15,175 --> 00:30:16,717
And that will happen in June.

258
00:30:17,748 --> 00:30:18,789
And we can, moving on.

259
00:30:19,249 --> 00:30:22,931
So this is an important part of the beginning of any budget conversation.

260
00:30:22,971 --> 00:30:25,293
It's talking about our fixed cost increases.

261
00:30:26,254 --> 00:30:32,558
And as is not unusual, because as a school department, as every school department, our budget is mostly made up of personnel.

262
00:30:32,958 --> 00:30:36,200
We're an organization made up of people trying to educate people.

263
00:30:36,801 --> 00:30:40,603
And so that's where most of the taxpayers' money goes.

264
00:30:40,623 --> 00:30:44,826
And you'll see that with regard to our fixed cost increases,

265
00:30:45,687 --> 00:30:56,884
of $850,000, that is usually, and this coming year is no exception, the largest number with regard to our anticipated fixed cost increases.

266
00:30:56,924 --> 00:30:59,849
So those are step increases and other contractual increases.

267
00:31:00,547 --> 00:31:04,029
that we know that we have to budget for in FY23.

268
00:31:04,469 --> 00:31:08,270
Some of the other numbers, and these numbers are not insignificant, so I don't want to just skip over them.

269
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:14,553
We are coming up on the third year of a 311 transportation contract with our primary vendor.

270
00:31:15,513 --> 00:31:32,491
Eastern bus that was a contract that was approved in Excuse me in the spring of 2020 that has a fixed cost increase of $20,000 We included this row because it's a rare bit of good news with regard to fixed cost increases thanks to the hard work of

271
00:31:33,312 --> 00:31:35,154
representatives from my office, particularly Ms.

272
00:31:35,194 --> 00:31:41,038
Kingdon, our comptroller, who's been working with our copy machine vendor, Ricoh.

273
00:31:41,619 --> 00:31:46,743
We've been able to identify some efficiencies and some services that are not utilized at all by the school department.

274
00:31:47,125 --> 00:31:49,546
or at least not in a cost-efficient manner.

275
00:31:49,586 --> 00:31:56,770
And so we're anticipating a $20,000 savings in the extension of our RICO contract for FY23.

276
00:31:57,890 --> 00:32:12,497
We have some built-in costs, including the expansion of some translation services that we committed to during FY22, which was a discounted initial year, but there's an additional cost coming on based on that contract of $16,000.

277
00:32:14,938 --> 00:32:26,807
The maintenance services contract, I'm sure that the committee is aware that we have a vendor that provides our maintenance services during the night shift at the McGlynn School, as well as Medford High School.

278
00:32:27,267 --> 00:32:38,315
That contract expires in November, and so that contract will be going out to bid most likely this summer, and so we'll need to prepare for potential increase in costs with respect to that.

279
00:32:38,955 --> 00:32:39,916
On the utilities front,

280
00:32:41,817 --> 00:32:45,981
going back to a conversation we had just a few moments ago with regard to the MSB application.

281
00:32:47,062 --> 00:32:51,586
We are going to finish the year over budget with regard to our gas expenses.

282
00:32:52,347 --> 00:32:57,232
We think there are some reasons for that, both in addition to the increase in the cost of gas, as well as

283
00:32:57,972 --> 00:33:02,295
some of the COVID mitigation strategies that have been employed throughout the district.

284
00:33:02,935 --> 00:33:06,437
And we're also expecting to see a more modest increase in our electricity bills.

285
00:33:06,877 --> 00:33:10,619
And again, that is connected to some of the repairs that we've done over the course of the last year.

286
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:12,040
The $155,000 in

287
00:33:15,401 --> 00:33:19,543
contractual services and subscription services is an estimate.

288
00:33:20,283 --> 00:33:21,784
Hopefully it's a liberal one.

289
00:33:22,284 --> 00:33:23,765
Hopefully those will come in.

290
00:33:24,025 --> 00:33:25,665
We're going through them one by one.

291
00:33:25,685 --> 00:33:28,246
There's some ongoing negotiations with regard to those renewals.

292
00:33:29,107 --> 00:33:32,308
But that essentially represents a 4% increase in contractual services.

293
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:42,302
is everything from the various electronic platforms that we use to run our HR systems to our teacher educator evaluation systems to a variety of other platforms.

294
00:33:42,622 --> 00:33:47,869
And then there's a host of instructional subscription services that are up for renewal as well.

295
00:33:48,429 --> 00:33:55,671
So some of those have been and maybe continue to be appropriate to apply to some of our ESSER funding.

296
00:33:56,371 --> 00:34:16,415
But as we get into the deeper conversations with regard to our ESSER funding, ESSER funding being the direct to school district COVID mitigation funding coming from the federal government, we have to be mindful of the non-reoccurring nature of those funds and the importance of avoiding fiscal cliffs.

297
00:34:18,561 --> 00:34:19,901
And so we'll just move on.

298
00:34:20,021 --> 00:34:46,188
On the instructional side, we have, you received multiple presentations over the course of the last year, including in your April 4th meeting, in which we had committed to a new elementary school math program after an extensive piloting and a lot of research by Dr. Khan and Mr. Lucey and several others, especially a lot of teachers that have helped develop that as a priority and identify it as a strategy.

299
00:34:46,813 --> 00:34:47,333
for the district.

300
00:34:47,373 --> 00:34:49,094
There is a cost associated with that.

301
00:34:50,155 --> 00:34:56,037
There will be some savings as well for the programming that we're moving away from, which should offset that.

302
00:34:56,077 --> 00:34:59,639
But just to identify a number, and these numbers are not set in stone.

303
00:34:59,679 --> 00:35:02,860
In fact, the negotiations are still ongoing between the district and the vendor.

304
00:35:03,442 --> 00:35:10,786
for transparency purposes and to make sure that you understand that there is a significant investment coming forth with respect to the Investigations III math program.

305
00:35:11,286 --> 00:35:24,152
We're estimating at this point $100,000 per year, plus additional costs with respect to professional development opportunities for teachers participating in that program.

306
00:35:24,936 --> 00:35:28,837
as well as potential FTEs devoted to math coaches.

307
00:35:29,458 --> 00:35:34,099
And in a minute, we'll talk a little bit about the response to the budget survey that committee members filled out.

308
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:40,561
And I know instructional coaches was identified as a personnel priority for several members of the committee.

309
00:35:40,581 --> 00:35:44,903
And you'll recall last budget season that it was a priority for the administration as well.

310
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:53,818
But at the time, we felt that we needed to have the programming in place prior to establishing the personnel structure to support that programming.

311
00:35:54,199 --> 00:36:09,554
So there's a range here, because there are some strategic decisions that will have to be made in the course of your budget deliberations, and we'll talk about that both, I think, during the organizational structure budget hearing, as well as in the equity budget hearing as well.

312
00:36:10,214 --> 00:36:11,935
Right now, we've got a placeholder in of 195,000 to 410,000.

313
00:36:12,195 --> 00:36:22,258
And this is sort of your first, I guess, sneak peek at some of the budgetary priorities that will be coming before you in the coming weeks.

314
00:36:22,358 --> 00:36:27,540
And I hope not a surprise because it's, again, the math coaches have been something that we've talked about for several years.

315
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:30,241
And we think now that the timing is starting to align.

316
00:36:30,714 --> 00:36:33,615
between that priority and the structure that we need to put them in place.

317
00:36:34,095 --> 00:36:41,216
Finally, at the bottom of that slide, you'll just see that as we've discussed throughout the course of this year, our collective bargaining agreements are up.

318
00:36:41,296 --> 00:36:45,797
I know there's a number of members of the organization, the community, and I suspect in this room that are aware of that.

319
00:36:46,417 --> 00:36:52,078
And those negotiations are ongoing and we're looking forward to bringing those hopefully to a conclusion in the near future.

320
00:36:52,938 --> 00:36:58,079
And so that is a budgetary estimate with respect to their potential impact.

321
00:36:59,589 --> 00:37:04,486
And next, we have news from Beacon Hill.

322
00:37:06,913 --> 00:37:22,065
I imagine some of you are aware that Governor Baker's budget that was released and is currently being deliberated by the state legislature included an 8.8%, I think I have that number right, although I'd ask that he not quote me, an 8.8% increase in Chapter 70 funding.

323
00:37:22,105 --> 00:37:30,471
So this is a significant investment, one that is reflective of more favorable revenue conditions that the state is experiencing right now.

324
00:37:31,011 --> 00:37:40,858
And so districts across the Commonwealth are seeing both, at least for this fiscal year, a fulfillment of the Student Opportunity Act commitments that were passed in 2019 or 2020, I believe it was fall of 2019.

325
00:37:45,751 --> 00:37:49,313
and also increases with respect to Chapter 70.

326
00:37:49,733 --> 00:38:07,884
So when you look at this number, you can see that the state, the governor's budget, and typically we're not gonna go down historically, we're gonna go up from there, is a $1.6 million increase in the Medford Chapter 70 allocation, as well as a $2.2 million increase with regard to the required local contribution.

327
00:38:08,644 --> 00:38:26,057
Um, I put the asterisk there because, um, as, as you know, uh, Medford is already far exceeding, um, our, uh, and I'm editorializing there a bit with regard to the word far, but we are exceeding our, uh, chapter 70, uh, allocation in our, in our local contribution.

328
00:38:26,097 --> 00:38:31,882
And so, um, we are grateful to the mayor and to the city council for that prioritization of education.

329
00:38:32,462 --> 00:38:44,209
But it also means that that essentially subsumes that increase, and these numbers don't necessarily mean what they would for us if we were at minimum funding.

330
00:38:44,289 --> 00:38:45,649
So we're grateful to that.

331
00:38:45,669 --> 00:38:51,092
We also think that this is reflective of the accelerating costs that we're seeing, particularly in a post-pandemic environment.

332
00:38:51,993 --> 00:39:01,418
And when we look at the ESSER funding as non-reoccurring, it sort of speaks to the importance of making sure that the necessary funds are incorporated into the operating budget

333
00:39:02,098 --> 00:39:05,701
to address reoccurring expenses that we know come with teaching and learning.

334
00:39:05,741 --> 00:39:12,907
So that's where we are at the state level, and that, again, will be reflected in the priorities that come before you.

335
00:39:14,369 --> 00:39:26,839
With regard to the budgetary priorities that have been identified by the school committee that will be reflected in the budget hearings that we will address, I know this has been going on for some time, so I will just say that there's only a couple of slides left, and I appreciate your indulgence.

336
00:39:29,265 --> 00:39:42,993
With regard to the critical priorities, what we've heard from all stakeholders that we've engaged in thus far is the importance of identifying social, emotional wellness and mental health, understanding that, again, that the impacts of the pandemic go well beyond academics.

337
00:39:43,473 --> 00:39:49,917
And so from a staffing perspective, from a professional learning perspective, and really from every other strategic perspective, what you'll be seeing in the budget

338
00:39:50,297 --> 00:39:58,844
is a prioritization of the wellness of our students to make sure that they are both prepared for life and prepared to learn instructionally and otherwise.

339
00:40:00,285 --> 00:40:05,589
A number of committee members have identified the reduction or potential elimination of fee-based services.

340
00:40:05,609 --> 00:40:16,477
I would just say that the administration has heard the committee loud and clear with regard to that principled position, and we're going to do our best to identify the strategies necessary to effectuate that goal.

341
00:40:17,818 --> 00:40:32,706
We have our CTE position postings, with the exception of the open and continuous postings that went up in the first week of March, we have CTE postings that are already up, understanding that we've got programs that are growing there and we need to make sure that we're staffed appropriately.

342
00:40:33,206 --> 00:40:40,609
And then the summer and extended day programming that we've been able to engage in over the course of the last year, that will certainly continue in FY23 as well.

343
00:40:42,412 --> 00:40:47,441
On the personnel front, I've already touched upon a number of them already, so I'm not going to read bullet by bullet there.

344
00:40:47,461 --> 00:40:53,173
And then we can move on to some of the other areas that we'll be talking a little bit about in the hearings.

345
00:40:54,549 --> 00:41:08,197
Having a plan to backfill and replace technology that becomes antiquated or is in need of repair is a piece that you'll be hearing about, as well as some of the other curriculum pieces that we've already discussed tonight, including investigations three.

346
00:41:08,777 --> 00:41:22,425
Professional learning and professional development is a priority of every school system, but making sure that it is effective, that it is relevant, that we're not sending staff to PD that doesn't necessarily apply to their role in the organization.

347
00:41:22,905 --> 00:41:28,428
and making sure that it's innovative and helping to prepare students for current learning conditions is what's important.

348
00:41:29,468 --> 00:41:43,074
And then with regard to the equity and the student support pieces, again, these are some of the things that we've talked about in previous budget cycles, some of which we've been able to implement over the course of FY22 and others that we'll be continuing to explore how best to implement in FY23.

349
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:55,634
These are some of the bullet points that we'll be needing to look at, as again, there's a major variable with respect to the number of collective bargaining agreements that are open, and negotiations are ongoing there.

350
00:41:55,654 --> 00:42:06,502
A piece that I think we're gonna hear and we're gonna have to discuss in a very substantive way during the budget process is that we know that the ARPA funding and the ESSER funding are one-time funds.

351
00:42:06,542 --> 00:42:14,188
The one-time funds spread out over multiple fiscal years, which is significant, and I think it's been a game changer for us with regard to

352
00:42:14,948 --> 00:42:21,372
the impact we've been able to have on students to try to mitigate the impact of the pandemic, but they're not reoccurring funds.

353
00:42:21,392 --> 00:42:28,215
And so we do have a responsibility to try to avoid the types of fiscal cliffs that can be problematic for the organization in the future.

354
00:42:28,595 --> 00:42:32,757
And that will require a lot of strategy and engagement with all stakeholders.

355
00:42:33,398 --> 00:42:36,499
That'll be part of what we'll do with the budget hearings that are going forward.

356
00:42:36,539 --> 00:42:37,300
So I appreciate

357
00:42:38,629 --> 00:42:43,730
your indulgence going through that 60, it's not as easy to spend $67 million as it may seem.

358
00:42:44,530 --> 00:42:54,913
And so that's why I think it's important from time to time to go through these and as detailed a fashion as possible so that we can try to answer your questions and try to provide as much information as possible to the community.

359
00:42:55,493 --> 00:42:57,274
And with that, I'm happy to take your questions.

360
00:42:59,714 --> 00:43:07,016
Member Graham, on the topic of transportation, when we have the budget hearing, will you be talking to us about

361
00:43:07,639 --> 00:43:27,297
the efforts that we piloted this year to make getting to the high school fee free for students who are outside of two miles and the review that you all were doing to bring that outer threshold in from two miles to something less than two miles.

362
00:43:27,982 --> 00:43:28,363
Thank you, Ms.

363
00:43:28,403 --> 00:43:28,723
Graham.

364
00:43:28,783 --> 00:43:32,706
I would anticipate that being a topic in the equity and student support budget hearing.

365
00:43:33,387 --> 00:43:44,336
I will say, and I think this has been referenced before, but the pilot program that we run this year costs approximately $9,000 to provide the MBTA passes to students outside of that radius.

366
00:43:45,216 --> 00:43:50,200
I mentioned that the Eastern bus contract has one year remaining.

367
00:43:51,949 --> 00:44:02,792
In light of the flexibility we have with regard to the one-time funds under ESSER, I think it is possible for us to recommend that we continue the pilot into a second year.

368
00:44:03,213 --> 00:44:13,556
I also think it's important that we analyze how effective it's been in really giving students the type of flexibility that the pilot is intended to do, because I don't want to continue to spend $90,000 if it's not being utilized.

369
00:44:17,677 --> 00:44:33,704
When the bus contract expires at the end of going into FY 24, and this is not a reflection in any way on Eastern Bus, which is an important partner of ours, I think we will have to look at putting out bid specifications that are consistent with that goal.

370
00:44:34,084 --> 00:44:39,726
And ultimately, I think that's probably going to be the more cost efficient way to effectuate that goal that the committee has set.

371
00:44:40,647 --> 00:44:40,947
Thank you.

372
00:44:41,267 --> 00:44:41,507
Thank you.

373
00:44:42,199 --> 00:44:45,780
I guess I just kind of gave you a preview of that hearing as well, but maybe we'll move faster that night.

374
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:46,060
Okay.

375
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:46,681
Sounds good.

376
00:44:48,201 --> 00:44:48,741
Member Rousseau.

377
00:44:49,521 --> 00:44:49,922
Thank you.

378
00:44:52,162 --> 00:44:59,885
Can you remind me, cause I feel like I have to be reminded every year food services will or will not be part of any of our budget presentations.

379
00:45:01,345 --> 00:45:08,748
So the food services runs on a revolving account, which certainly I think all the revolving funds should be identified.

380
00:45:09,621 --> 00:45:10,542
in the budget process.

381
00:45:10,682 --> 00:45:14,986
It's separate from the operating budget, and so it's not part of that conversation.

382
00:45:15,847 --> 00:45:32,001
But I think for making sure that we're making the community and the committee aware as to the health of the revolving fund, participation, which I'm grateful to say, has risen somewhat significantly this year, and we're in a relatively favorable position with regard to that revolving fund.

383
00:45:33,381 --> 00:45:40,382
So it's not really part of the operating budget, but I think it's something that's good to check in on at the end of the year, which we're obviously approaching.

384
00:45:40,903 --> 00:45:41,463
Great, thank you.

385
00:45:41,583 --> 00:45:59,466
And last year, forgive me for the date, we had passed a motion to make meals free, which unbeknownst, I don't remember who else co-sponsored that, but unbeknownst to the folks that put this on our agenda,

386
00:46:00,353 --> 00:46:06,758
the federal government over that weekend announced they were going to make it free for every school district across the country.

387
00:46:07,158 --> 00:46:08,219
But our motion did not

388
00:46:09,304 --> 00:46:13,205
indicate that it was free during the pandemic or free for a year.

389
00:46:13,225 --> 00:46:14,626
It was free, period.

390
00:46:15,566 --> 00:46:23,149
And so I think as long as that language is still understood and clear, I'm fine with that.

391
00:46:23,189 --> 00:46:31,312
But I do think that unless somebody is willing to put a motion on to start charging kids, the policy of our committee is that we will not be going forward.

392
00:46:31,332 --> 00:46:33,813
And I just don't have any idea what that's gonna really cost us.

393
00:46:34,304 --> 00:46:47,912
Yeah, so the administration may well be willing to ask for a motion to that effect, frankly, because while the revolving fund is healthy, it's not something that we have a clear plan on as to how to make that transition for the next three years.

394
00:46:48,252 --> 00:47:01,120
I think, as I said, I think that the reduction or elimination of fee-based services is something that this committee has been emphatically clear on, and it's something that the administration has worked to explore all avenues

395
00:47:02,751 --> 00:47:05,393
As I said, with regard to transportation, I think we have a plan for that.

396
00:47:05,753 --> 00:47:08,935
With regard to the food services, I think that's going to be more difficult.

397
00:47:09,416 --> 00:47:16,821
And I can't say at this time that I'm overly confident that it's something we'd be able to implement for the 22-23 school year.

398
00:47:17,641 --> 00:47:25,827
Again, the committee's priority is clear, and it's our responsibility to develop a strategy, a plan, or some type of contingency to come back to you on.

399
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:30,371
And I think we will be doing that, again, part of that equity discussion.

400
00:47:30,411 --> 00:47:35,116
But I can't identify a way to implement that as of right now.

401
00:47:35,616 --> 00:47:35,856
Thank you.

402
00:47:38,198 --> 00:47:43,864
And just to follow up on that, I'll look into it from the delegation, but has the state, have you heard of any discussions in the state?

403
00:47:43,884 --> 00:47:45,686
Discussions, but nothing definitive yet.

404
00:47:48,419 --> 00:47:51,120
I was just going to say the same thing.

405
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:59,661
I think there is discussion on Beacon Hill about this because the federal legislation has effectively died on the vine.

406
00:47:59,781 --> 00:48:15,784
So I think there is discussion and for folks who are passionate about this, letting your state reps know that this is important to you would be a wonderful reinforcement of priorities here in Medford, for sure.

407
00:48:17,366 --> 00:48:22,770
And then I did have another question and I'm forgetting it now, so I will see if the board members.

408
00:48:23,070 --> 00:48:23,350
Thank you.

409
00:48:23,430 --> 00:48:23,611
Yes.

410
00:48:23,771 --> 00:48:37,980
On the school meals, there is a, there's a forum on Thursday for the school meals that representative Vargas is running specifically because the federal government's sort of fallen flat on this effort.

411
00:48:38,721 --> 00:48:46,546
And I'll be attending that hopefully to find out how we can push because to suddenly start

412
00:48:48,010 --> 00:48:53,453
you know, the fact that participation went up is entirely not surprising.

413
00:48:54,433 --> 00:49:01,017
But the other way of describing participation going up is kids weren't eating who needed to eat.

414
00:49:01,697 --> 00:49:06,119
And that doesn't, none of us are surprised by that, but we have actual numbers now.

415
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:08,661
So I think,

416
00:49:10,037 --> 00:49:20,885
I would be remiss if I didn't mention that our district food manager, Joe Ricci, part of Jules Bradley's staff has been working hard to diversify the menu and to engage students more.

417
00:49:21,066 --> 00:49:28,311
Again, I think their staff knows that we know that we want to see participation grow higher and deeper.

418
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:34,415
And so it's something that's definitely a work in progress, but I do want to credit them for the work that they've done over the course of the last year.

419
00:49:34,976 --> 00:49:35,196
Thank you.

420
00:49:36,843 --> 00:49:37,263
Member Graham?

421
00:49:37,903 --> 00:49:39,084
Sorry, I remembered my question now.

422
00:49:40,084 --> 00:49:56,950
Before your time, I believe, the sequence of events is foggy because of the pandemic, but before your time, we did pass a resolution asking the administration to review with us on an annual basis the status of all of our revolving accounts.

423
00:49:57,945 --> 00:50:08,676
And I know that's not part of the mainline budget, but when we talk about food service and another hot topic in the community right now, the afterschool program, those all happen in the revolving accounts.

424
00:50:08,716 --> 00:50:13,521
I think generally the public doesn't have a huge appreciation for what happens in those revolving accounts.

425
00:50:14,021 --> 00:50:18,806
And it's literally everything from like lost library book funds to food service.

426
00:50:19,026 --> 00:50:20,588
So can we,

427
00:50:21,636 --> 00:50:28,701
find some time before the end of June to do that review of the revolving accounts and community schools is the other really big one that happens.

428
00:50:28,761 --> 00:50:30,683
I think we definitely find some time before June.

429
00:50:31,083 --> 00:50:37,468
I can just, uh, my office will need some time with the new onboarding CFO.

430
00:50:38,208 --> 00:50:48,996
Um, and I don't want to be asking him for a particular question before he's actually moved into his office, but, uh, this will be one of the first conversations that we'll be having so that we can be prepared for that conversation.

431
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:49,517
Okay.

432
00:50:49,757 --> 00:50:50,037
Thank you.

433
00:50:52,217 --> 00:51:02,782
Mr. Murphy, could you explain the professional development cost of between $195,000 and $410,000, and why the large range?

434
00:51:02,802 --> 00:51:04,503
Sure, on the investigation, sorry?

435
00:51:05,383 --> 00:51:05,623
Yes.

436
00:51:05,963 --> 00:51:12,126
So, as I mentioned, the negotiations with Savas,

437
00:51:16,286 --> 00:51:17,907
Thank you.

438
00:51:18,007 --> 00:51:27,391
The investigation into how to pronounce the name of the vendor that runs investigations is ongoing, as are the negotiations with regard to those costs.

439
00:51:27,451 --> 00:51:39,957
So we have, as is always the case with professional development opportunities, how much is going to be done by the vendor, how much is going to be a train-the-trainer model, all of those are variables that could potentially affect the overall financial impact.

440
00:51:40,342 --> 00:51:42,183
That's the $30,000 to $50,000 range.

441
00:51:42,263 --> 00:51:43,123
That'll be a placeholder.

442
00:51:43,403 --> 00:51:45,464
We'll have it nailed down prior to your vote.

443
00:51:45,824 --> 00:51:46,645
I can promise you that.

444
00:51:47,465 --> 00:51:56,089
And then the other big variable is if we're going to go down the way of instructional coaches, we have to make a determination as to what the capacity is with regard to FTEs.

445
00:51:56,189 --> 00:52:04,132
So, you know, in a world where the ESSER funding was reoccurring and was going to be around in perpetuity, I'm pretty confident that it would be the higher number.

446
00:52:05,509 --> 00:52:10,332
and that we would plan to have those schools staffed with that type of capacity at all times.

447
00:52:10,973 --> 00:52:20,140
In a world where it's not reoccurring, I think it's more likely that we're gonna have to at least start with fewer FTEs and share those resources between schools, which is the other variable there.

448
00:52:23,102 --> 00:52:24,083
Does that answer that question?

449
00:52:24,103 --> 00:52:24,543
Yes, thank you.

450
00:52:24,563 --> 00:52:24,784
Thank you.

451
00:52:27,286 --> 00:52:27,946
Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

452
00:52:28,186 --> 00:52:29,027
Thank you, Meredith, thank you.

453
00:52:34,895 --> 00:52:37,195
We have number six.

454
00:52:37,536 --> 00:52:39,396
Can I address the school committee?

455
00:52:39,876 --> 00:52:41,256
If it's about a personnel matter, no.

456
00:52:41,616 --> 00:52:44,877
It's not about a personnel matter.

457
00:52:44,897 --> 00:52:45,817
I want to suspend the meeting.

458
00:52:45,857 --> 00:52:46,917
Did you put it on the agenda?

459
00:52:48,058 --> 00:52:48,178
No.

460
00:52:48,198 --> 00:52:51,258
I tried to put it on the agenda, but I wasn't allowed to put it on the agenda.

461
00:52:51,298 --> 00:52:53,599
It's put on the agenda the Wednesday before our meeting.

462
00:52:53,619 --> 00:52:54,159
Yeah, I know.

463
00:52:54,219 --> 00:52:56,499
I did get it on Wednesday before noontime.

464
00:52:56,860 --> 00:53:01,320
And it was turned down because I didn't dot all my I's and cross my T's.

465
00:53:02,941 --> 00:53:03,941
I didn't ask to put

466
00:53:04,704 --> 00:53:08,747
I described what I wanted to do, what I wanted to talk about.

467
00:53:08,767 --> 00:53:10,469
You asked to speak about equity.

468
00:53:10,609 --> 00:53:10,889
Yes.

469
00:53:10,909 --> 00:53:11,489
And Ms.

470
00:53:11,549 --> 00:53:15,412
Weiss said that you would be given the date when there would be an equity presentation.

471
00:53:15,432 --> 00:53:15,512
Yeah.

472
00:53:15,993 --> 00:53:18,315
She would reach out to you so that you would be on the agenda.

473
00:53:18,755 --> 00:53:21,077
That's the last communication that I received.

474
00:53:21,237 --> 00:53:21,857
And that's it.

475
00:53:23,118 --> 00:53:23,579
All right, no.

476
00:53:23,679 --> 00:53:24,660
Okay, yes.

477
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:26,421
Yeah, we'll make sure you're on the agenda for the equity discussion.

478
00:53:26,441 --> 00:53:28,082
And what about all the people that are here tonight?

479
00:53:28,182 --> 00:53:29,884
We can't get on the agenda tonight?

480
00:53:30,444 --> 00:53:32,246
We can't suspend the rules for them?

481
00:53:33,046 --> 00:53:33,727
Just asking.

482
00:53:35,027 --> 00:53:36,428
This is the people right here.

483
00:53:36,869 --> 00:53:37,930
They're here for Diane.

484
00:53:37,990 --> 00:53:39,991
We all know it, but we can't address it.

485
00:53:40,572 --> 00:53:42,554
We cannot discuss personnel matters.

486
00:53:42,634 --> 00:53:44,575
We're not talking about discussing personnel matters.

487
00:53:44,595 --> 00:53:46,517
Mr. Perchella, we do read all of our emails.

488
00:53:46,657 --> 00:53:48,479
Anybody can voice their opinion on an email.

489
00:53:48,499 --> 00:53:50,961
I just want you to know that all these people are here tonight for Diane.

490
00:53:51,121 --> 00:53:51,441
Thank you.

491
00:53:51,622 --> 00:53:51,982
All right?

492
00:53:52,082 --> 00:53:55,825
You guys are going to go do your thing, because these people don't matter.

493
00:53:56,065 --> 00:53:57,046
And that's the bottom line.

494
00:53:57,066 --> 00:53:57,647
That's not true.

495
00:54:16,350 --> 00:54:19,954
Presentations of the public not to begin before 7 p.m.

496
00:54:20,635 --> 00:54:21,596
Is there a motion to?

497
00:54:24,459 --> 00:54:24,659
Mayor?

498
00:54:27,988 --> 00:54:30,929
Motion to suspend the 7 p.m.

499
00:54:31,009 --> 00:54:32,689
and make it 6 53 tonight.

500
00:54:32,729 --> 00:54:43,053
Motion to suspend the rules by member Rousseau, seconded by second member and the motion is to suspend the the not before 7 p.m.

501
00:54:43,093 --> 00:54:43,613
Correct?

502
00:54:43,633 --> 00:54:44,054
That's correct.

503
00:54:44,274 --> 00:54:44,494
Okay.

504
00:54:44,714 --> 00:54:46,735
Motion by member Rousseau, second by member Graham.

505
00:54:46,775 --> 00:54:47,555
All those in favor?

506
00:54:47,915 --> 00:54:48,115
Aye.

507
00:54:48,355 --> 00:54:49,095
All those opposed?

508
00:54:49,856 --> 00:54:50,516
Motion passes.

509
00:54:51,263 --> 00:54:59,228
Regular meetings of the school committee include this presentation of the public agenda item to give any resident the opportunity to place a presentation before the school committee.

510
00:55:00,048 --> 00:55:02,209
A resident may only present once at any meeting.

511
00:55:03,070 --> 00:55:09,273
These presentations are an opportunity for the public to make a presentation to the committee, but are not opportunities for dialogue with the committee.

512
00:55:09,714 --> 00:55:17,638
If one or more members of the committee wishes to have a conversation about the topic presented, a member may request that an item be added to a subsequent regular meeting.

513
00:55:18,179 --> 00:55:20,520
The details for submitting a presentation can be found

514
00:55:20,967 --> 00:55:24,748
within the policy BEDH, public comment, and presentations of the public.

515
00:55:25,328 --> 00:55:34,211
Pursuant to policy BEDH, public comment, and presentations of the public, any resident in the audience may be given permission to speak once on any item on the agenda for up to three minutes.

516
00:55:34,651 --> 00:55:37,592
The speaker is expected to keep their comments to the item on the agenda.

517
00:55:37,692 --> 00:55:41,373
The speaker must begin their comments by providing their full name and full street address.

518
00:55:41,953 --> 00:55:46,815
A welcoming, inclusive community is both a value of the Medford School Committee and an aspirational goal.

519
00:55:48,148 --> 00:55:50,950
for your help in achieving this goal and value your perspective.

520
00:55:51,571 --> 00:56:01,899
We do not have any public participation before us tonight, but anybody can submit an item the Wednesday before an upcoming school committee meeting, as long as it's not personnel related.

521
00:56:03,020 --> 00:56:07,104
So number seven, we have continued business and there is none.

522
00:56:07,124 --> 00:56:10,046
Number eight, new business and there is none.

523
00:56:10,066 --> 00:56:11,828
Number nine, reports requested.

524
00:56:11,848 --> 00:56:13,969
And number 10, we have condolences.

525
00:56:14,190 --> 00:56:15,591
Member Russell.

526
00:56:16,145 --> 00:56:20,706
Yes, I believe we did actually approve a report request two meetings ago.

527
00:56:21,186 --> 00:56:24,887
So we should just have that added to the agenda and coming in the future.

528
00:56:24,907 --> 00:56:26,447
I think that was just an oversight.

529
00:56:27,907 --> 00:56:28,207
Thank you.

530
00:56:30,448 --> 00:56:40,790
The Medford School Committee expresses its sincere condolences to the family of Barbara Salvatella, wife of the late Arthur Salvatella.

531
00:56:41,479 --> 00:56:54,956
former media teacher and advisor to the Mustang News, the Medford School Committee expresses its sincere condolences to the family of Linda Granara Scali, cousin of former school committee member and former state representative John R. Granara Jr.

532
00:56:54,996 --> 00:56:56,839
If we all may rise for a moment of silence.

533
00:57:12,990 --> 00:57:16,611
Our next meeting is Monday, May 2nd, 2022 at 6 p.m.

534
00:57:16,691 --> 00:57:23,012
Regular school committee meeting, Alden Memorial Chambers, Medford City Hall, and it will also be viewable on Zoom.

535
00:57:28,474 --> 00:57:29,974
Motion to adjourn by member Hayes.

536
00:57:33,855 --> 00:57:36,596
Yes, I believe you can put things on the agenda in person.

537
00:57:36,616 --> 00:57:38,436
Should we go to Susie or?

538
00:57:39,056 --> 00:57:40,057
Yeah, the Wednesday before.

539
00:57:40,257 --> 00:57:41,077
The Wednesday before.

540
00:58:08,017 --> 00:58:21,648
It's about people all over.

541
00:58:23,770 --> 00:58:30,915
That's what's right for me.

542
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:39,720
Thank you.

543
00:59:02,611 --> 00:59:06,938
Motion to adjourn by Member Hayes, seconded by Member Kretz.

544
00:59:07,299 --> 00:59:07,940
All those in favor?

545
00:59:08,541 --> 00:59:08,701
Aye.

546
00:59:08,941 --> 00:59:09,562
All those opposed?

547
00:59:10,444 --> 00:59:11,065
Meeting is adjourned.
