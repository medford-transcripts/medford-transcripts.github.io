1
00:03:16,797 --> 00:03:17,778
[SPEAKER_12]: Should I wait.

2
00:03:18,418 --> 00:03:23,461
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I was just wondering because the screen is full.

3
00:03:28,344 --> 00:03:31,245
[SPEAKER_12]: Governance Committee, February 4 2025.

4
00:03:32,766 --> 00:03:34,887
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. Clerk, what can you please call the roll.

5
00:03:35,147 --> 00:03:35,868
[SPEAKER_04]: President Bears.

6
00:03:36,488 --> 00:03:37,009
[SPEAKER_11]: President.

7
00:03:38,409 --> 00:03:42,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Collins, Councilor Lazzaro, Councilor Scarpelli.

8
00:03:43,935 --> 00:03:46,998
[SPEAKER_12]: chair saying presidents five presidents none absent.

9
00:03:47,698 --> 00:03:50,341
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Callahan is also here with us tonight.

10
00:03:51,602 --> 00:03:56,667
[SPEAKER_12]: Paper 24-468 resolution to discuss updates to the city charter.

11
00:03:56,747 --> 00:04:06,736
[SPEAKER_12]: This is the second substantive meeting with us reviewing the Charter Study Committee's recommendations as we've received them from the mayor's office.

12
00:04:08,237 --> 00:04:22,485
[SPEAKER_12]: More specifically, we will be discussing Article 3 about the Executive Branch, Article 5, Administrative Organization, Article 6, Financial Procedures, and Article 7 regarding elections tonight.

13
00:04:22,785 --> 00:04:26,707
[SPEAKER_12]: I did receive some emails asking if we would be taking up compensation tonight.

14
00:04:27,607 --> 00:04:32,690
[SPEAKER_12]: As per a motion from the last Governance Committee meeting, we will be taking that up

15
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,071
[SPEAKER_12]: at our next governance committee meeting.

16
00:04:35,792 --> 00:04:38,173
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe that's February 19th at 6 p.m.

17
00:04:39,815 --> 00:04:44,918
[SPEAKER_12]: I did respond to the emails I got about that, but I did want to make that announcement first.

18
00:04:49,681 --> 00:04:55,125
[SPEAKER_12]: If there are no opening comments, I was thinking we could get straight into the content.

19
00:04:58,047 --> 00:05:00,388
[SPEAKER_10]: With that being said, oh, Councilor Strunk.

20
00:05:03,551 --> 00:05:10,146
[SPEAKER_10]: The biggest discussions that are still left out there is this won't be discussed tonight just for clarification would be the.

21
00:05:12,008 --> 00:05:14,770
[SPEAKER_10]: The composition 2-1.

22
00:05:16,351 --> 00:05:18,212
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

23
00:05:18,232 --> 00:05:31,441
[SPEAKER_12]: 2-1, I know the committee made a few motions regarding that we adopted some amended language that was a compromise between President Bears' language and the language that we received.

24
00:05:32,422 --> 00:05:39,427
[SPEAKER_12]: Although, I made a note with my vote and the committee made a note with a general motion

25
00:05:41,688 --> 00:05:50,147
[SPEAKER_12]: that we wanted to leave that open for a committee, the whole meeting following our last governance committee meeting.

26
00:05:52,313 --> 00:05:55,194
[SPEAKER_12]: with that being noted, moving on to article three.

27
00:05:55,434 --> 00:05:55,634
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah.

28
00:05:55,654 --> 00:05:55,994
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

29
00:05:56,014 --> 00:05:56,175
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

30
00:05:56,195 --> 00:06:06,118
[SPEAKER_10]: I just, I just have clarification because I, I think that was the confusion, Matt, Mr. Chair, that, so again, you just confused me right there.

31
00:06:06,158 --> 00:06:07,738
[SPEAKER_10]: So did we vote on anything?

32
00:06:08,258 --> 00:06:09,199
[SPEAKER_00]: We voted seven.

33
00:06:09,679 --> 00:06:11,739
[SPEAKER_10]: Are we doing the seven that Zach said?

34
00:06:11,859 --> 00:06:16,621
[SPEAKER_10]: Are we, have we eliminated the option of, of at lodge for all eight?

35
00:06:16,701 --> 00:06:19,862
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the question that people were very confused when they left the other day.

36
00:06:21,246 --> 00:06:31,016
[SPEAKER_12]: So what we have voted on is a change to make it nine members in total, five at large, four representing districts.

37
00:06:32,138 --> 00:06:35,862
[SPEAKER_12]: But we did also note that we wanted to hold a committee of the whole meeting

38
00:06:36,542 --> 00:06:40,887
[SPEAKER_12]: for Councilors Callahan and Leming to be able to vote on the final version.

39
00:06:41,347 --> 00:06:45,391
[SPEAKER_12]: And at that meeting, we can talk about edits to what we have.

40
00:06:45,592 --> 00:06:49,856
[SPEAKER_12]: So we can talk about going back to the Charter Study Committee's recommendation.

41
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:54,881
[SPEAKER_12]: We can talk about other compromises, proposals that people might have.

42
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:56,603
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, just to share with the Council.

43
00:06:57,143 --> 00:07:02,226
[SPEAKER_10]: the conversation I've had with multiple community members and community groups with that.

44
00:07:03,046 --> 00:07:16,694
[SPEAKER_10]: The question was, if this is voted, then moved on to the mayor's office, the mayor has the option to deny that and request the original format, correct?

45
00:07:17,414 --> 00:07:20,276
[SPEAKER_10]: Or will that stop the process?

46
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:25,824
[SPEAKER_10]: because again, we're trying to work this so we can get this to the legislation, right?

47
00:07:26,164 --> 00:07:38,593
[SPEAKER_10]: So our legislators that I've talked to aren't very happy that we're moving against what their constituents are reaching out to them about what we're doing here, what was done at that vote, and what was done with the review committee.

48
00:07:39,773 --> 00:07:45,738
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think that that's going to be something we can talk to at that next meeting, but I want to be clear that residents

49
00:07:47,464 --> 00:07:51,425
[SPEAKER_10]: feel like they're not informed enough to understand the process as we're rushing through this.

50
00:07:51,845 --> 00:07:54,826
[SPEAKER_10]: And they want to know, is there a stop?

51
00:07:54,886 --> 00:08:03,929
[SPEAKER_10]: So if they feel like they're not being listened to us, the question is, can the mayor, maybe the calling center can help us, can the mayor stop the process?

52
00:08:03,949 --> 00:08:12,032
[SPEAKER_10]: If she doesn't feel that this is what is best for the city, she can not allow this to move forward to the legislation, right?

53
00:08:12,052 --> 00:08:15,713
[SPEAKER_12]: Name and address for the record, please.

54
00:08:16,153 --> 00:08:16,373
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks.

55
00:08:22,723 --> 00:08:24,084
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. Wright.

56
00:08:29,546 --> 00:08:31,307
[SPEAKER_08]: Maryland Country is Collins Center.

57
00:08:31,807 --> 00:08:32,727
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

58
00:08:33,748 --> 00:08:50,815
[SPEAKER_03]: In response to Councilor Scarpelli's question, the mayor must approve both the city council and the mayor must approve the version of the charter that is sent to legislature.

59
00:08:53,867 --> 00:09:06,539
[SPEAKER_03]: If she does not approve the version sent to her by this body, then she can just simply veto it, or there may be some informal discussion to try to resolve that.

60
00:09:08,842 --> 00:09:09,162
Thank you.

61
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:26,844
[SPEAKER_10]: that we invite all of our state legislators here because I think it's important because their constituents are reaching out to them because I know that one state representative sat down with me and wanted to miss the meeting.

62
00:09:26,884 --> 00:09:28,385
[SPEAKER_10]: So he wanted to know what was going on.

63
00:09:28,845 --> 00:09:29,785
[SPEAKER_10]: So he's a little confused.

64
00:09:29,845 --> 00:09:41,609
[SPEAKER_10]: So if we can have that as a form of emotion, but if we could just put that as a, just a bookmark, just so that we understand that for the residents that are listening,

65
00:09:42,194 --> 00:09:50,562
[SPEAKER_10]: what this council votes on and then moves forward, the mayor then has the option to say, uh, nope, we're not going to send this to the legislation legislators.

66
00:09:50,582 --> 00:09:59,050
[SPEAKER_10]: We're not going to send this to the state for vote to get this on the ballot, or she can veto and pick what she feels is the best choice.

67
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:01,192
[SPEAKER_03]: That's correct.

68
00:10:01,272 --> 00:10:05,977
[SPEAKER_03]: The only thing I would differentiate between other legislation is that there is no ability

69
00:10:06,589 --> 00:10:08,790
[SPEAKER_03]: by this council to override a veto.

70
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:09,510
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

71
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:09,750
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

72
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:10,450
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

73
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:11,351
[SPEAKER_12]: That makes, thank you.

74
00:10:11,371 --> 00:10:13,151
[SPEAKER_12]: I appreciate that.

75
00:10:13,251 --> 00:10:16,772
[SPEAKER_12]: Any other comments before we move on to section 3-1?

76
00:10:18,533 --> 00:10:19,513
[SPEAKER_12]: Seeing none.

77
00:10:20,033 --> 00:10:20,353
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

78
00:10:21,774 --> 00:10:26,135
[SPEAKER_12]: Section 3-1, mayor qualifications, term of office, compensation prohibitions.

79
00:10:26,195 --> 00:10:30,437
[SPEAKER_12]: Does anyone have any comments, suggestions, remarks on this section?

80
00:10:33,918 --> 00:10:34,518
[SPEAKER_12]: Seeing none.

81
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:36,335
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yes.

82
00:10:38,357 --> 00:10:39,577
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, 3-1.

83
00:10:40,858 --> 00:10:44,660
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe it's on page 10 of the package.

84
00:10:46,941 --> 00:10:47,642
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll give you a sec.

85
00:10:51,304 --> 00:10:51,564
[SPEAKER_12]: Great.

86
00:10:53,265 --> 00:10:57,107
[SPEAKER_12]: Section 3-2, executive powers, enforcement of ordinances.

87
00:10:59,289 --> 00:11:01,530
[SPEAKER_12]: I see Councilor Collins, Vice President Collins.

88
00:11:03,728 --> 00:11:04,108
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

89
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:08,050
[SPEAKER_06]: I had what may just be a clarifying question on section 3-2.

90
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:15,894
[SPEAKER_06]: In subsection C, it says the mayor shall be by virtue of the office a member of every multiple member body of the city.

91
00:11:15,914 --> 00:11:23,218
[SPEAKER_06]: I was hoping to get a definition of what that would mean in practice from the Collins Center or representatives from the Charter Study Committee.

92
00:11:23,258 --> 00:11:25,499
[SPEAKER_06]: Does that mean any board or commission?

93
00:11:25,599 --> 00:11:27,120
[SPEAKER_06]: The mayor may have an informal

94
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:34,426
[SPEAKER_06]: say on or vote in if he or she chooses, or does it mean truly any multi-member body, including the City Council?

95
00:11:34,466 --> 00:11:37,028
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just, I'm not, I don't really know what to glean from that term.

96
00:11:40,631 --> 00:11:43,193
[SPEAKER_12]: Let me make sure it's on.

97
00:11:43,534 --> 00:11:43,914
[SPEAKER_12]: There we go.

98
00:11:44,114 --> 00:11:44,374
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

99
00:11:46,016 --> 00:11:50,440
[SPEAKER_08]: The City Council is separate from the definition of multiple member bodies.

100
00:11:52,027 --> 00:11:58,288
[SPEAKER_08]: It would be like the Planning Board, the Zone Board of Appeals, Conservation Commission, the Horticultural District Commission, those kinds of things.

101
00:12:01,229 --> 00:12:03,529
[SPEAKER_06]: And the Mayor has a voice but no vote.

102
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:06,610
[SPEAKER_06]: A voice but no vote on any board or commission.

103
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:08,170
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, great, thank you, that's very helpful.

104
00:12:10,331 --> 00:12:14,572
[SPEAKER_12]: Do we have any other comments from Councilors on Section 3-2?

105
00:12:22,628 --> 00:12:29,314
[SPEAKER_12]: I had one question, just to ask if this is standard practice for city charters.

106
00:12:29,655 --> 00:12:35,500
[SPEAKER_12]: I am not familiar that this is present practice in Medford.

107
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:38,903
[SPEAKER_12]: And I just wanted to ask if this is very standard.

108
00:12:39,023 --> 00:12:44,328
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, in terms of the being on boards, it does show up in the more recent charters.

109
00:12:45,009 --> 00:12:45,089
[SPEAKER_12]: OK.

110
00:12:46,393 --> 00:13:04,520
[SPEAKER_12]: And I guess one concern that I think some residents have brought up to me about this part is that there might be some commissions like, for example, the Human Rights Commission or the Disabilities Commission that are working on topics that are more sensitive and not that they're

111
00:13:06,081 --> 00:13:25,355
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, trying to go against the city in any way, but they want to be, you know, members have expressed to me wanting to have some freedom in terms of how they, you know, talk about issues in those committees, talk about analyzing what's going on in City Hall policies, making policy recommendations.

112
00:13:25,835 --> 00:13:34,461
[SPEAKER_12]: And there's some concern that having the mayor present might affect those discussions, the independence of those discussions.

113
00:13:35,516 --> 00:13:36,196
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, okay.

114
00:13:37,036 --> 00:13:39,377
[SPEAKER_08]: You're afraid that the mayor may stifle?

115
00:13:40,377 --> 00:13:41,438
[SPEAKER_12]: There's some concern.

116
00:13:41,558 --> 00:13:42,478
[SPEAKER_12]: Could we speak to that?

117
00:13:43,038 --> 00:13:44,458
[SPEAKER_08]: I really can't speak to that.

118
00:13:44,638 --> 00:13:45,839
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't heard of that.

119
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:46,439
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

120
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:55,021
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, in my experience with this, which is very limited, the mayor doesn't show up all that often.

121
00:13:56,181 --> 00:13:56,482
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

122
00:13:56,682 --> 00:13:57,442
[SPEAKER_03]: To the extent...

123
00:13:58,508 --> 00:14:08,515
[SPEAKER_03]: There may be a conflict of interest between the mayor and any agenda item at any particular meeting of such a board of commission.

124
00:14:09,156 --> 00:14:18,062
[SPEAKER_03]: The mayor would be subject to the state ethics clause and would be expected to avoid any conflicts of interest.

125
00:14:18,455 --> 00:14:25,960
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, I think, as for the mayor and the conflict of interest, the state ethics law and the mayor, I'm not as familiar.

126
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:34,346
[SPEAKER_12]: Say that there's a situation where, for example, water and sewer might be making a recommendation when it comes to setting rates.

127
00:14:34,986 --> 00:14:39,569
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that something theoretically that the mayor would then be barred from that conversation?

128
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:45,573
[SPEAKER_03]: Under this particular section?

129
00:14:45,854 --> 00:14:47,675
[SPEAKER_12]: Under this section and the state ethics laws.

130
00:14:49,552 --> 00:14:54,436
[SPEAKER_03]: No, the mayor would be able to have a voice, but not a vote.

131
00:14:55,336 --> 00:14:57,218
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not part of the Water and Soil Commission.

132
00:14:58,098 --> 00:14:58,419
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

133
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:01,901
[SPEAKER_12]: I just wanted to understand the section better.

134
00:15:01,921 --> 00:15:10,868
[SPEAKER_12]: I have no recommendations for motions of this body to make, but I just wanted to ask those questions.

135
00:15:11,709 --> 00:15:17,853
[SPEAKER_12]: Section, do any other councillors have anything, any questions or comments on section 3-2?

136
00:15:21,449 --> 00:15:21,969
[SPEAKER_12]: Seeing none.

137
00:15:22,329 --> 00:15:23,610
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, moving on.

138
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:25,830
[SPEAKER_12]: Section 3-3 appointments to the mayor.

139
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:29,051
[SPEAKER_12]: Do any councillors have, I see Councilor Lazzaro.

140
00:15:30,932 --> 00:15:31,932
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

141
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:46,736
[SPEAKER_05]: Section 3-3A mentions all city officers and department heads and the members of multiple member bodies for whom no other method of appointment or selection is provided by the charter.

142
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:50,117
[SPEAKER_05]: The mayor shall appoint

143
00:15:51,646 --> 00:15:51,786
[SPEAKER_05]: Council.

144
00:15:51,806 --> 00:15:52,627
[SPEAKER_05]: Mayor shall appoint.

145
00:15:53,727 --> 00:15:56,869
[SPEAKER_05]: All city officers and department heads and the members of the multiple member bodies.

146
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:05,454
[SPEAKER_05]: Um this, uh, I just wanted to mention that the Human Rights Commission has, um.

147
00:16:07,376 --> 00:16:10,077
[SPEAKER_05]: An ordinance in draft form.

148
00:16:10,097 --> 00:16:10,117
[SPEAKER_05]: I

149
00:16:20,242 --> 00:16:25,245
[SPEAKER_05]: Suggestion that we add the word or ordinance at the end of that sentence.

150
00:16:27,026 --> 00:16:32,709
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'd like to state that in the form of an ordinance, just to make an amendment to that sentence.

151
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:39,012
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you want me to email that to you?

152
00:16:41,974 --> 00:16:42,414
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, yes.

153
00:16:42,454 --> 00:16:43,354
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, President Bears.

154
00:16:43,715 --> 00:16:46,056
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, let me... Give me a sec.

155
00:16:47,797 --> 00:16:49,118
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I said second.

156
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,081
[SPEAKER_11]: I can happily join the queue.

157
00:16:52,141 --> 00:16:53,462
[SPEAKER_11]: I do have another comment on that.

158
00:16:58,746 --> 00:17:06,673
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe do councils are do you have any more comments or that's all I just wanted to motion to add the it that unless

159
00:17:09,078 --> 00:17:10,919
[SPEAKER_05]: It just says, sorry, I'll read it out.

160
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,501
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll read it out again for clarity.

161
00:17:12,741 --> 00:17:14,262
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause I basically read the sentence backwards.

162
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:32,456
[SPEAKER_05]: The mayor shall appoint subject to the review of such appointments by the city council under section two dash nine, all city officers and department heads and the members of multiple member bodies for whom no other method of appointment or selection is provided by the charter or ordinance is the amendment.

163
00:17:32,576 --> 00:17:37,540
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's basically saying the mayor appoints subject to the review

164
00:17:38,572 --> 00:17:48,095
[SPEAKER_05]: by City Council, all city officers and department heads and the members of multiple member bodies, unless that is in conflict with something in the charter.

165
00:17:48,616 --> 00:17:59,760
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm just adding unless that's in conflict with something in an ordinance, specifically because of the Human Rights Commission in Medford, that may be looking to avoid, you know,

166
00:18:02,818 --> 00:18:09,381
[SPEAKER_05]: just looking to account for diversity and inclusion in the appointment of multiple member bodies.

167
00:18:09,661 --> 00:18:17,444
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's the intention of this motion, but I will write out that full sentence and email that to the clerk.

168
00:18:18,057 --> 00:18:29,712
[SPEAKER_12]: I think to give a little bit of background, the Human Rights Commission is currently exploring a reform to its enabling ordinance.

169
00:18:29,972 --> 00:18:34,418
[SPEAKER_12]: The draft ordinance is in the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee right now.

170
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:39,943
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm helping with that effort so I can speak a little bit more to it.

171
00:18:41,004 --> 00:18:52,453
[SPEAKER_12]: Part of the idea is that you would have some appointments that come from other commissions, for example, the Disabilities Commission or future commissions that might be pertinent to the HRC's work.

172
00:18:53,014 --> 00:18:56,076
[SPEAKER_12]: And there's also a suggestion from

173
00:18:57,497 --> 00:19:06,923
[SPEAKER_12]: in the draft and from former members of the HRC that the City Council have some role in appointing members to the HRC as well.

174
00:19:08,003 --> 00:19:12,406
[SPEAKER_12]: And so that's to give background to what Councilor Lazzaro is saying.

175
00:19:13,167 --> 00:19:25,494
[SPEAKER_12]: And her amendment would be to add the words, ordinance after that first sentence, basically saying in the mayor chooses, mayor gets to appoint members of the multiple member board.

176
00:19:27,195 --> 00:19:34,319
[SPEAKER_12]: multiple member boards, um, except if there are other exceptions made in the city charter or by ordinance.

177
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:40,442
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, that's just the, to explain what, um, Councilor Lazzaro is saying.

178
00:19:40,843 --> 00:19:43,484
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, President, President Bears was in the queue next.

179
00:19:45,705 --> 00:19:46,106
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

180
00:19:46,146 --> 00:19:53,970
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I would also note that, um, there are a number of existing boards and commissions established by ordinance that have

181
00:19:54,742 --> 00:20:05,808
[SPEAKER_11]: appointing authorities from multiple different bodies, the Affordable Housing Trust, I believe, well, not the Affordable Housing Trust, sorry, the CPC, and some others as well.

182
00:20:06,088 --> 00:20:08,749
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think it's important to have that in there.

183
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:14,712
[SPEAKER_11]: But I did have one question, which is just as relates to by charter or ordinance.

184
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:24,077
[SPEAKER_11]: Could the Collins Center representative speak to whether by charter includes, if this were to pass,

185
00:20:24,493 --> 00:20:30,556
[SPEAKER_11]: Other special acts that apply to the city of Menford, for example, the Traffic Commission is established by special act.

186
00:20:31,376 --> 00:20:35,698
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe the Community Development Board is at least partly established by special act.

187
00:20:36,439 --> 00:20:38,260
[SPEAKER_11]: Certainly the Office of Community Development is.

188
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:47,364
[SPEAKER_11]: So does by charter also include special acts previously applying to the city before the assumed approval of this charter?

189
00:20:50,786 --> 00:20:53,027
[SPEAKER_12]: Did the folks from the call-in center hear the question?

190
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:57,812
[SPEAKER_12]: the whole thing.

191
00:20:58,072 --> 00:20:59,414
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think I got the gist of it.

192
00:20:59,474 --> 00:21:00,254
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, got it.

193
00:21:00,915 --> 00:21:05,999
[SPEAKER_12]: If you need clarification, I'll just, I'll ask President Bears again.

194
00:21:10,123 --> 00:21:17,009
[SPEAKER_08]: Usually a charter includes special acts that are retained and those that are repealed.

195
00:21:18,351 --> 00:21:18,551
[SPEAKER_08]: And

196
00:21:22,037 --> 00:21:43,302
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that section of this charter is not complete yet, but if it's mentioned in the charter, if the traffic commission was created by special act and we put in the charter that the special act is retained, you know, that section would apply.

197
00:21:45,123 --> 00:21:46,683
[SPEAKER_12]: President Bears, does that answer your question?

198
00:21:47,836 --> 00:21:49,937
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it spawns many other questions.

199
00:21:50,878 --> 00:21:52,258
[SPEAKER_11]: When will that be complete?

200
00:21:52,499 --> 00:21:53,879
[SPEAKER_11]: And when will we review it?

201
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:57,421
[SPEAKER_11]: And is the council on the hook for drafting that?

202
00:21:58,062 --> 00:22:01,904
[SPEAKER_11]: And does the Collins Center have a list of special acts that currently apply to the city?

203
00:22:05,446 --> 00:22:07,707
[SPEAKER_08]: We will probably have it when you discuss article nine.

204
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:13,370
[SPEAKER_12]: President Bears, do you have any follow up questions?

205
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:14,271
[SPEAKER_12]: Nope, that's good.

206
00:22:14,331 --> 00:22:14,671
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

207
00:22:16,186 --> 00:22:17,126
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, President Bears.

208
00:22:18,547 --> 00:22:29,410
[SPEAKER_12]: Does the call center have anything to add when it comes to the discussion about adding the words by ordinance into that sentence?

209
00:22:30,651 --> 00:22:35,292
[SPEAKER_12]: Or is there... Okay, I'm seeing a shaking.

210
00:22:37,293 --> 00:22:39,553
[SPEAKER_12]: I know Councilor Lazzaro has a motion.

211
00:22:39,573 --> 00:22:41,014
[SPEAKER_12]: Do we have a second on that motion?

212
00:22:43,228 --> 00:22:44,669
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, the person has seconded.

213
00:22:44,889 --> 00:22:47,190
[SPEAKER_12]: Are there any comments from members of the public?

214
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:48,591
[SPEAKER_12]: Because we are taking a vote.

215
00:22:51,532 --> 00:22:55,634
[SPEAKER_12]: Seeing none, Mr. Clerk, when you're ready.

216
00:22:58,696 --> 00:22:59,356
[SPEAKER_04]: President Bears.

217
00:23:02,098 --> 00:23:02,378
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

218
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:05,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Collins.

219
00:23:05,099 --> 00:23:05,159
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

220
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,240
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Lazzaro.

221
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:07,360
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

222
00:23:08,281 --> 00:23:08,921
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli.

223
00:23:08,941 --> 00:23:09,021
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

224
00:23:10,419 --> 00:23:10,959
[SPEAKER_04]: Chair Tseng.

225
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:15,683
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, four in the affirmative, one in the negative, motion passes.

226
00:23:17,324 --> 00:23:24,349
[SPEAKER_12]: Are there any other comments on this section, section 3-3 before we move on?

227
00:23:27,131 --> 00:23:27,892
[SPEAKER_12]: Seeing none.

228
00:23:27,912 --> 00:23:30,033
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

229
00:23:30,274 --> 00:23:34,817
[SPEAKER_12]: Are there any comments on section 3-4, removal or suspension of certain officials?

230
00:23:40,776 --> 00:23:51,824
[SPEAKER_12]: Seeing none, are there any questions, comments, motions on section 3-5, temporary appointments to city offices?

231
00:23:56,107 --> 00:23:57,509
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't see any from councillors.

232
00:23:57,829 --> 00:24:04,894
[SPEAKER_12]: I did have one thing I just wanted to ask slash note.

233
00:24:06,973 --> 00:24:24,010
[SPEAKER_12]: the section 3-5b about temporary appointments, extensions, is there any worry that this would hamstring us if we can't find a permanent or replacement after the extension?

234
00:24:25,071 --> 00:24:28,754
[SPEAKER_12]: The extension says it's basically 120 days

235
00:24:32,327 --> 00:24:40,751
[SPEAKER_12]: about a four-month extension after the temporary appointment of 180 days, which is about six months.

236
00:24:42,012 --> 00:24:42,632
[SPEAKER_08]: 300 days.

237
00:24:43,012 --> 00:24:45,613
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, 300 days, yeah.

238
00:24:46,334 --> 00:24:56,198
[SPEAKER_12]: I know there's some department head positions here that have, there's one that's been very widely talked about, the city solicitor role, which has been,

239
00:24:59,287 --> 00:25:03,850
[SPEAKER_12]: We haven't been able to find any qualified applicants for that for years now.

240
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:14,879
[SPEAKER_12]: Is there a worry that there might be something, a legal challenge that comes up there or a problem when it comes to getting someone to do that job?

241
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:19,503
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there someone temporarily filling the position?

242
00:25:20,048 --> 00:25:24,511
[SPEAKER_12]: So right now we have KP law on retainer.

243
00:25:24,771 --> 00:25:32,175
[SPEAKER_12]: So the mayor's office has a legal opinion saying that they can step in as our city solicitor.

244
00:25:32,816 --> 00:25:36,398
[SPEAKER_12]: But this question is applicable to different departments as well.

245
00:25:39,921 --> 00:25:50,612
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think I don't see this as applying to KP law because I would be a contract between the city and a private firm to provide the city with legal services.

246
00:25:54,155 --> 00:25:57,459
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're talking about appointing somebody as acting.

247
00:25:59,797 --> 00:26:14,226
[SPEAKER_03]: and you get to 300 days, then I suppose there may be a question, but it would seem at that point, perhaps the city would want to move one way or the other with regards to that person.

248
00:26:14,246 --> 00:26:19,048
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, understood.

249
00:26:19,809 --> 00:26:27,073
[SPEAKER_12]: Are there any other comments from councillors or members of the public on section 3-5, temporary appointments to city offices?

250
00:26:30,472 --> 00:26:32,473
[SPEAKER_12]: Seeing none, okay.

251
00:26:33,094 --> 00:26:35,675
[SPEAKER_12]: Section 3-6, communication special meetings.

252
00:26:35,875 --> 00:26:39,398
[SPEAKER_12]: Are there any comments from councillors or members of the public?

253
00:26:40,338 --> 00:26:42,880
[SPEAKER_12]: Or councillors first, I guess.

254
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,001
[SPEAKER_12]: Vice President Collins, you're live.

255
00:26:46,031 --> 00:26:46,952
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Chair Sung.

256
00:26:47,873 --> 00:26:50,455
[SPEAKER_06]: This again might be a comment or it might just be a clarifying question.

257
00:26:50,856 --> 00:27:02,266
[SPEAKER_06]: In section 3-6, let me check the subsection number, subsection B. It reads, the mayor may call a special meeting of the city council for any purpose.

258
00:27:05,356 --> 00:27:16,202
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just hoping to understand better like how this what this maybe tracked with most from our current charter right now, there's a provision for special meetings to be called for the city council when it's necessary.

259
00:27:16,222 --> 00:27:25,827
[SPEAKER_06]: It can be done by a quorum of city Councilors or by the president of the city council, but I don't believe that we currently have it in practice for the mayor to be able to call a special meeting of the city council.

260
00:27:25,887 --> 00:27:28,469
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'd like to understand a little bit more about the rationale behind that.

261
00:27:29,089 --> 00:27:34,772
[SPEAKER_06]: So I can understand if I the reasoning for it being written into the city charter that that's a new power of mayor.

262
00:27:36,267 --> 00:27:38,368
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that something the Collins Center could speak to?

263
00:27:38,388 --> 00:27:38,468
[SPEAKER_12]: Sure.

264
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:55,796
[SPEAKER_08]: It's pretty standard in charters because mayors may have information or be presented with an emergency or other situation that consultation with the council is needed.

265
00:27:58,257 --> 00:28:01,178
[SPEAKER_12]: Vice President Collins, does that satisfy your question?

266
00:28:01,735 --> 00:28:02,195
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, thank you.

267
00:28:02,256 --> 00:28:10,223
[SPEAKER_06]: It makes sense is the rationale it's I think that there's going through this project, obviously, some stipulations are more major more consequential than others.

268
00:28:10,984 --> 00:28:20,153
[SPEAKER_06]: I think some of my deliberations around the charter around which of those things are consequential that we should change and which of those things.

269
00:28:22,402 --> 00:28:27,683
[SPEAKER_06]: are strategies that we want available to the mayor, the city council, other bodies, but don't necessarily need to be written into the charter.

270
00:28:27,743 --> 00:28:32,244
[SPEAKER_06]: So this just strikes me as kind of a shift in the dynamic, potentially a symptom of a shifting dynamic.

271
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:39,006
[SPEAKER_06]: In the past, I think that the mayor has always been able to collaborate with city leadership when there's an emergency meeting that needs to be called.

272
00:28:39,046 --> 00:28:41,206
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, I don't think that this is the most important thing before us.

273
00:28:42,066 --> 00:28:47,207
[SPEAKER_06]: But it did strike me as a change and a new power of the mayor over the city council.

274
00:28:47,307 --> 00:28:50,428
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's just something that I want to give due consideration to and think a bit more about.

275
00:28:52,081 --> 00:28:53,222
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Vice President Collins.

276
00:28:53,402 --> 00:28:54,982
[SPEAKER_12]: Are there any other comments?

277
00:28:59,485 --> 00:29:01,666
[SPEAKER_12]: Seeing none, any comments from the public?

278
00:29:04,847 --> 00:29:05,608
[SPEAKER_12]: Seeing none as well.

279
00:29:06,708 --> 00:29:11,391
[SPEAKER_12]: Moving on to section 3-7, approval of city mayor veto.

280
00:29:11,991 --> 00:29:15,032
[SPEAKER_12]: Are there any comments from councilors on this point?

281
00:29:19,315 --> 00:29:19,975
[SPEAKER_12]: Seeing, oh.

282
00:29:22,037 --> 00:29:22,741
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks for catching that.

283
00:29:23,143 --> 00:29:24,148
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Callahan.

284
00:29:25,142 --> 00:29:25,362
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

285
00:29:25,402 --> 00:29:29,763
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a little bit more of a general question about this whole section.

286
00:29:31,423 --> 00:29:38,505
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just, I do have a question for the chair of the study committee who I so appreciate being here in person.

287
00:29:39,845 --> 00:29:46,807
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't see any survey questions about strong mayor versus weak mayor or about the strength of the mayor.

288
00:29:46,847 --> 00:29:53,328
[SPEAKER_01]: My understanding is we have one of the strongest mayoral sort of systems in the whole state.

289
00:29:54,649 --> 00:29:55,149
[SPEAKER_01]: and country.

290
00:29:56,090 --> 00:30:08,003
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just curious if there was discussion among the community that you heard how much of the, you know, whether this.

291
00:30:10,143 --> 00:30:13,124
[SPEAKER_01]: was talked about on the commission.

292
00:30:14,005 --> 00:30:22,009
[SPEAKER_01]: And specifically, I'm really talking about appointments, both department heads, as well as boards of commissions, the budget.

293
00:30:22,749 --> 00:30:27,611
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just comes up in here because of the ability of the mayor to veto

294
00:30:29,552 --> 00:30:31,013
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, anything coming out of the City Council.

295
00:30:31,293 --> 00:30:42,917
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just curious kind of how the sort of strong Mayor Week Mayor fit into the discussions both internally within the committee as well as more broadly within the public.

296
00:30:46,438 --> 00:30:48,899
[SPEAKER_12]: Chair McDonald, name and address for the record, please.

297
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:51,520
[SPEAKER_07]: Mildred McDonald, 61 Monument Street.

298
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:53,240
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for the question.

299
00:30:55,470 --> 00:31:02,634
[SPEAKER_07]: Strong mayor, weak mayor is terms that get thrown around a lot, but we basically have a mayor council form of government.

300
00:31:02,854 --> 00:31:14,080
[SPEAKER_07]: And we did look at balance of power, and we had also heard talk around town about Medford having an inordinately powerful mayor.

301
00:31:14,181 --> 00:31:17,422
[SPEAKER_07]: So we asked the Collins Center for an analysis.

302
00:31:19,712 --> 00:31:29,360
[SPEAKER_07]: and they provided an analysis, which is in the final report, and you can see that Medford's mayor is in line with other mayors in the state.

303
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:33,363
[SPEAKER_07]: Our mayor does not have more power than other mayors in the state.

304
00:31:35,004 --> 00:31:44,131
[SPEAKER_07]: But we did talk about balance of power when we looked at a lot of different things, and we talked about it with the budget.

305
00:31:44,291 --> 00:31:45,352
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a consideration.

306
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:53,334
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Callahan, do you have any more questions or?

307
00:31:53,354 --> 00:31:54,515
[SPEAKER_09]: No, thanks.

308
00:31:54,915 --> 00:31:55,356
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

309
00:31:56,417 --> 00:31:59,839
[SPEAKER_12]: Are there any other comments on section 3-7?

310
00:32:03,622 --> 00:32:04,303
[SPEAKER_12]: Seeing none.

311
00:32:05,624 --> 00:32:08,146
[SPEAKER_12]: Any other comments from members of the public?

312
00:32:09,948 --> 00:32:10,368
[SPEAKER_12]: Seeing none.

313
00:32:12,099 --> 00:32:14,802
[SPEAKER_12]: Section 3-8, temporary absence of the mayor.

314
00:32:15,022 --> 00:32:18,426
[SPEAKER_12]: Do any councillors have any questions about this section?

315
00:32:23,591 --> 00:32:24,772
[SPEAKER_12]: Seeing none from councillors.

316
00:32:24,792 --> 00:32:28,035
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, just one question.

317
00:32:28,996 --> 00:32:33,901
[SPEAKER_11]: Assuming an extended absence, would the acting mayor

318
00:32:38,401 --> 00:32:52,065
[SPEAKER_11]: I just think I would find it very difficult for any councillor to take on the role of acting mayor for months without, would that person receive the compensation of the mayor?

319
00:32:52,245 --> 00:32:57,367
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just unclear to me how that would work, especially given that councillors have other jobs.

320
00:32:59,908 --> 00:33:03,409
[SPEAKER_12]: And would like- Is that a question for discussion or a question for the call center?

321
00:33:04,212 --> 00:33:05,414
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I mean, I don't have a proposal.

322
00:33:05,454 --> 00:33:07,797
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just wondering how, how has this worked in other communities?

323
00:33:07,857 --> 00:33:15,006
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, it seems like an acting mayor coming from the council would have to take a leave from their full time job to fulfill that role.

324
00:33:15,026 --> 00:33:16,748
[SPEAKER_11]: How would they be compensated?

325
00:33:19,809 --> 00:33:20,349
[SPEAKER_12]: Understood.

326
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:21,170
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

327
00:33:21,991 --> 00:33:34,221
[SPEAKER_12]: Would the folks from the Collins Center have a response or examples of different cities where someone might've stepped in as an acting mayor and how the compensation would work in that situation?

328
00:33:36,603 --> 00:33:38,805
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a standard provision.

329
00:33:38,825 --> 00:33:47,232
[SPEAKER_08]: The premise behind it is that someone elected by the voters of the city should serve as the mayor.

330
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:53,611
[SPEAKER_08]: is the absence of the mayor.

331
00:33:54,131 --> 00:33:55,932
[SPEAKER_12]: I have a quick follow-up question for that.

332
00:33:57,032 --> 00:34:11,677
[SPEAKER_12]: Would it then make sense then in the compensation section in somewhere in this charter to note that if someone is serving, if a Councilor is serving as acting mayor, they should be compensated for that work, for that full-time work?

333
00:34:13,738 --> 00:34:16,919
[SPEAKER_08]: This is for temporary absence, so.

334
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:21,330
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be up to you.

335
00:34:21,951 --> 00:34:22,171
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

336
00:34:23,091 --> 00:34:33,196
[SPEAKER_12]: I note that as something the council might want to take up when we talk about compensation at the next governance committee meeting.

337
00:34:33,896 --> 00:34:35,637
[SPEAKER_12]: President Bears, do you have any more questions?

338
00:34:36,938 --> 00:34:46,462
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I guess just as written now, what would you say that this charter would compensate an acting mayor who is a member of the council?

339
00:34:54,135 --> 00:34:59,338
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, could do the folks from the call center have a have a response to that question?

340
00:34:59,838 --> 00:35:01,499
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

341
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:03,540
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, there's no response to that question.

342
00:35:04,521 --> 00:35:08,523
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so yeah, I think we need to clarify what that is, if it's unclear in the language as written.

343
00:35:08,543 --> 00:35:12,565
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I think that's an important note.

344
00:35:12,605 --> 00:35:13,566
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, President Ferris.

345
00:35:14,126 --> 00:35:16,387
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, do you have any more questions or comments?

346
00:35:17,768 --> 00:35:18,148
[SPEAKER_11]: All set.

347
00:35:18,208 --> 00:35:18,629
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

348
00:35:19,809 --> 00:35:20,250
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

349
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:22,491
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, I had a quick

350
00:35:23,432 --> 00:35:28,733
[SPEAKER_12]: question or two about logistics technicalities.

351
00:35:29,133 --> 00:35:33,254
[SPEAKER_12]: The first one is just statutory or charter language.

352
00:35:33,754 --> 00:35:42,775
[SPEAKER_12]: When it comes to that last sentence in part A, the mayor may at any point declare themselves able to perform the duties of office.

353
00:35:43,036 --> 00:35:51,037
[SPEAKER_12]: I think I understand where that applies, but because that's put at the very end of the paragraph,

354
00:35:52,112 --> 00:36:04,959
[SPEAKER_12]: I do have some worries that it might be, you know, it might be, there might be a situation where the city council by unanimous vote does determine that the mayor is unable to serve.

355
00:36:05,819 --> 00:36:16,665
[SPEAKER_12]: And then the mayor argues that that sentence should apply to the whole paragraph and says just unilaterally declares themselves mayor.

356
00:36:17,286 --> 00:36:18,466
[SPEAKER_12]: I think, is there, is that a,

357
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:23,534
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that a worry that we should have?

358
00:36:23,554 --> 00:36:28,717
[SPEAKER_12]: And is there a clarifying language we could have put in there about this?

359
00:36:32,719 --> 00:36:34,820
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not thinking of any offhand.

360
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:39,762
[SPEAKER_08]: This is pretty, this is standard.

361
00:36:39,842 --> 00:36:46,266
[SPEAKER_08]: This is person's on vacation, person has an operation, person has to leave town because

362
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:53,001
[SPEAKER_08]: something happened to a relative out of state, you know, that's what these things are for.

363
00:36:53,021 --> 00:37:07,465
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's actually become less and less of an issue with technology being the way it has developed over the last few decades where you can be anywhere in the world and still participate by Zoom or

364
00:37:08,376 --> 00:37:21,400
[SPEAKER_12]: If that is the intention then of language like this, is there a worry or is there any worry that a city council could, you know, a future city council could abuse the language written here?

365
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:30,702
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, you know, if they don't like the mayor and everyone on the city council doesn't like whoever the mayor is, votes to... Oh, well, I think you're headed to court then.

366
00:37:30,942 --> 00:37:31,203
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

367
00:37:31,623 --> 00:37:33,743
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

368
00:37:33,843 --> 00:37:36,104
[SPEAKER_12]: I see Councilor, Vice President Collins

369
00:37:37,572 --> 00:37:57,221
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you chair saying I appreciate you bringing that up it was something that I had highlighted in my initial read, and the last sentence as you noted and just, again, you know, doing us as, as we have to do reading this with a fine tooth comb kind of looking for areas where there could potentially be confusion, totally heard that I think with a lot of with many of the issues that we're bringing

370
00:37:58,465 --> 00:38:05,751
[SPEAKER_06]: know, it's unlikely that these things would ever be issues, but you know, it is, in a way, our responsibility to look for things that could be so we can make this document as airtight as it can be.

371
00:38:08,153 --> 00:38:10,034
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just I flagged that as well.

372
00:38:10,074 --> 00:38:10,875
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad you brought it up.

373
00:38:10,995 --> 00:38:23,045
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that if there's a way to kind of maintain the purpose of this article and make sure that you know, we're not leaving a stone unturned with if there's a more straightforward way of organizing this paragraph that it doesn't

374
00:38:24,842 --> 00:38:33,266
[SPEAKER_06]: there is no arbitrariness in how it could be, or there's no flexibility in how it could be read, I would be happy to consider that language at a future meeting.

375
00:38:33,926 --> 00:38:52,095
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe it won't end up changing, but in my initial read of it, I did read this paragraph, and at the end, I was like, in what condition may the mayor declare themselves able, and how does that interplay with the city council's

376
00:38:54,602 --> 00:38:57,265
[SPEAKER_06]: unanimous vote mentioned earlier.

377
00:38:57,305 --> 00:39:00,708
[SPEAKER_06]: So if there's no further clarification that's needed, that's great.

378
00:39:00,868 --> 00:39:03,651
[SPEAKER_06]: But I would be interested in having this further clarified if possible.

379
00:39:04,852 --> 00:39:05,913
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Vice President Collins.

380
00:39:05,993 --> 00:39:07,454
[SPEAKER_12]: I see President Bears is on Zoom.

381
00:39:08,836 --> 00:39:09,156
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks.

382
00:39:09,196 --> 00:39:10,917
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I have the same initial question.

383
00:39:10,937 --> 00:39:13,920
[SPEAKER_11]: And I thought about it for a minute.

384
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:19,706
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think this is specifically for a case or example where

385
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:23,851
[SPEAKER_11]: the mayor is unable to declare themselves unable to serve.

386
00:39:24,031 --> 00:39:31,173
[SPEAKER_11]: For example, if a mayor was in an accident and was unconscious, the council could make that vote.

387
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:42,416
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think it's intended to sit at the, you know, if the council has a dispute over the mayor's competency and chooses to vote unanimously to remove the mayor,

388
00:39:44,703 --> 00:39:51,108
[SPEAKER_11]: And the mayor is of not enough mind to write and sign a letter saying that they do have the competency to serve as mayor.

389
00:39:51,128 --> 00:39:56,031
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it solves for that.

390
00:39:57,612 --> 00:40:02,516
[SPEAKER_11]: Essentially, the council couldn't abuse the power because the mayor could immediately reinstate themselves.

391
00:40:03,276 --> 00:40:09,821
[SPEAKER_11]: But in a situation where the mayor is unable to recuse themselves from the office,

392
00:40:11,636 --> 00:40:16,520
[SPEAKER_11]: because of some sort of unexpected event that in that case, it would allow the council to take such a vote.

393
00:40:19,343 --> 00:40:20,284
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, President Bears.

394
00:40:20,884 --> 00:40:25,288
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that's how I think I do read it that way, too.

395
00:40:25,728 --> 00:40:27,230
[SPEAKER_12]: But I just

396
00:40:28,852 --> 00:40:35,276
[SPEAKER_12]: statutory interpretation is something that is, you know, shifting a lot these days, going back and forth a lot these days.

397
00:40:35,316 --> 00:40:38,698
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think that's why I wanted to flag it.

398
00:40:38,898 --> 00:40:43,241
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think, you know, councillors can dwell on this.

399
00:40:43,881 --> 00:40:50,405
[SPEAKER_12]: We can take this back up at the committee, the whole meeting as well, if needed, if any councillors feel is needed.

400
00:40:51,995 --> 00:40:55,197
[SPEAKER_12]: President Bears, is your hand raised from before or do you have anything else?

401
00:40:55,477 --> 00:40:56,178
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, great.

402
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:03,444
[SPEAKER_12]: Do any other Councilors have questions on Section 3-8?

403
00:41:06,206 --> 00:41:12,951
[SPEAKER_12]: Seeing none, do any members of the public have any comments or questions on Section 3-8?

404
00:41:15,573 --> 00:41:17,395
[SPEAKER_12]: Seeing none as well, okay.

405
00:41:19,659 --> 00:41:22,341
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, I did have one more question for this section.

406
00:41:23,362 --> 00:41:35,754
[SPEAKER_12]: In part B, this was just a clarifying question, where a member of the city council is serving as acting mayor.

407
00:41:35,874 --> 00:41:39,117
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's say that that member of the city council is the president of the city council.

408
00:41:40,658 --> 00:41:44,782
[SPEAKER_12]: The last sentence is clear that they shouldn't vote as a member of the city council.

409
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:48,802
[SPEAKER_12]: can they still preside over that meeting?

410
00:41:49,482 --> 00:41:55,488
[SPEAKER_12]: Or is the only power that's carved out the voting power?

411
00:41:55,548 --> 00:42:03,036
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you do have a vice president, so there wouldn't be a need for him for them to oversee the meeting.

412
00:42:03,436 --> 00:42:06,339
[SPEAKER_12]: So it would be expected that the vice president would take over?

413
00:42:06,359 --> 00:42:06,439
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

414
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:06,800
[SPEAKER_12]: OK.

415
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,842
[SPEAKER_03]: You cannot participate.

416
00:42:11,478 --> 00:42:31,427
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're holding a position as the executive, as a member of the legislative body, so you'd have to recuse yourself effectively from any participation, other than perhaps speaking, you know, as a member of the public might, or other elected official might, but not as a member of the city.

417
00:42:32,833 --> 00:42:34,535
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that makes a lot of sense to me.

418
00:42:35,977 --> 00:42:38,920
[SPEAKER_12]: That's not entirely clear from the language in the charter itself.

419
00:42:40,642 --> 00:42:44,927
[SPEAKER_12]: Is this language that we have in front of us standard for different cities?

420
00:42:45,267 --> 00:42:45,467
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

421
00:42:45,948 --> 00:42:46,148
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

422
00:42:48,090 --> 00:42:52,014
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess one more question that just popped into my mind when it comes to

423
00:42:54,079 --> 00:43:06,322
[SPEAKER_12]: You guys mentioned that in a situation where this council is maybe abusing its power and the mayor comes back and says, that's what's happening, that might be litigated.

424
00:43:06,522 --> 00:43:07,742
[SPEAKER_12]: Is there any precedent for that?

425
00:43:07,762 --> 00:43:10,802
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there is.

426
00:43:12,723 --> 00:43:14,663
[SPEAKER_08]: But I can't recall it.

427
00:43:16,064 --> 00:43:16,704
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

428
00:43:17,184 --> 00:43:18,044
[SPEAKER_08]: It's old.

429
00:43:21,586 --> 00:43:26,270
[SPEAKER_12]: With that being said, those are my final thoughts on section 3-8.

430
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:30,193
[SPEAKER_12]: Are there any other thoughts on 3-8 before we move on to 3-9?

431
00:43:33,156 --> 00:43:33,696
[SPEAKER_12]: Seeing none.

432
00:43:33,716 --> 00:43:34,637
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

433
00:43:35,058 --> 00:43:37,660
[SPEAKER_12]: Section 3-9, delegation of authority by the mayor.

434
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:41,864
[SPEAKER_12]: Do any councilors have any questions on this section, questions or comments?

435
00:43:45,987 --> 00:43:46,688
[SPEAKER_12]: Seeing none.

436
00:43:48,686 --> 00:43:52,970
[SPEAKER_12]: Section 3-10, vacancy in the office of the mayor.

437
00:43:53,370 --> 00:43:55,952
[SPEAKER_12]: Do any Councilors have questions or comments on this section?

438
00:44:00,055 --> 00:44:01,556
[SPEAKER_12]: Seeing none.

439
00:44:04,439 --> 00:44:13,586
[SPEAKER_12]: Do any members of the public have any comments on this section or Article 3 about the mayor's office, the executive branch?

440
00:44:17,002 --> 00:44:23,383
[SPEAKER_12]: Seeing none, I did have a really quick question with regards to section 3-2.

441
00:44:23,543 --> 00:44:25,704
[SPEAKER_12]: I forgot this in the moment.

442
00:44:26,604 --> 00:44:32,926
[SPEAKER_12]: It relates back to Councilor Collins's point about the mayor being a member of every multiple member body of the city.

443
00:44:34,386 --> 00:44:43,068
[SPEAKER_12]: I think the following sentences are very clear on what the mayor's role is when it comes to multiple member bodies.

444
00:44:44,128 --> 00:44:59,659
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm wondering if there is any worry that the first sentence, just by saying a member instead of saying an ex-official member, if there's any statutory interpretation problem there.

445
00:45:00,039 --> 00:45:07,745
[SPEAKER_12]: I know it's evident in the second sentence, but I could see a court arguing that because we didn't put it in the first sentence, that signals some other intent.

446
00:45:22,744 --> 00:45:23,284
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't see it.

447
00:45:23,344 --> 00:45:24,544
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, fine.

448
00:45:24,764 --> 00:45:26,125
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't see it as problematic.

449
00:45:26,685 --> 00:45:27,125
[SPEAKER_12]: Understood.

450
00:45:27,805 --> 00:45:28,245
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

451
00:45:31,566 --> 00:45:36,908
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, I'm seeing that there are no hands up, no requests to speak.

452
00:45:38,108 --> 00:45:40,829
[SPEAKER_12]: Moving on to section five, article five.

453
00:45:42,879 --> 00:45:44,340
[SPEAKER_12]: administrative organization.

454
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:51,182
[SPEAKER_12]: Do any Councilors have questions about Section 5-1 about the organization of city agencies?

455
00:45:57,204 --> 00:45:58,284
[SPEAKER_12]: Seeing none.

456
00:45:59,305 --> 00:46:00,785
[SPEAKER_12]: Do Councilors have questions?

457
00:46:00,905 --> 00:46:02,506
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yes, Vice President Collins.

458
00:46:04,906 --> 00:46:05,407
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry about that.

459
00:46:05,447 --> 00:46:06,787
[SPEAKER_06]: It took me a second to find my notes.

460
00:46:08,368 --> 00:46:10,608
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, sorry, another clarifying question for me.

461
00:46:11,669 --> 00:46:12,229
[SPEAKER_06]: We're in Section

462
00:46:13,115 --> 00:46:14,537
[SPEAKER_06]: 5-1 yes great.

463
00:46:16,098 --> 00:46:16,899
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just hoping.

464
00:46:18,741 --> 00:46:21,644
[SPEAKER_06]: If any examples could be given of the section that describes.

465
00:46:24,682 --> 00:46:37,856
[SPEAKER_06]: This procedure where the mayor prepares and submits to the city council plan in the city that council then holds a hearing on it and it seems like there's a vote and this is obviously I'm trying to compare this to what we're familiar with.

466
00:46:37,896 --> 00:46:42,582
[SPEAKER_06]: We're familiar with ordinances being promulgated by the city council and petitions and papers coming from

467
00:46:43,643 --> 00:46:48,687
[SPEAKER_06]: the community via the mayor's office and city administration to the council.

468
00:46:49,528 --> 00:46:52,010
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to figure out if this describes something different.

469
00:46:52,090 --> 00:47:00,477
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this like, is this a mechanism by which the mayor is proposing an ordinance, a new department, like a change to administration?

470
00:47:00,957 --> 00:47:07,563
[SPEAKER_06]: Like when we say that the mayor is proposing a plan to the city council and then the city council may take a vote to disapprove of that plan.

471
00:47:07,623 --> 00:47:09,525
[SPEAKER_06]: Could you give an example of what that might be about?

472
00:47:10,255 --> 00:47:25,199
[SPEAKER_03]: Perhaps the easiest way to see what the intent of this is, is to look at the administrative codes of Chelsea or Melrose or Bonsable, the three that come to mind.

473
00:47:26,399 --> 00:47:33,481
[SPEAKER_03]: The intent is really to describe in very general terms, the,

474
00:47:36,275 --> 00:47:40,022
[SPEAKER_03]: function of the various administrative departments.

475
00:47:48,565 --> 00:47:49,586
[SPEAKER_03]: boards and commissions.

476
00:47:50,346 --> 00:47:54,308
[SPEAKER_03]: So, but to the extent you want an example might be helpful.

477
00:47:54,348 --> 00:47:58,130
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, I'd refer you to Chelsea, Bostonville, Melrose.

478
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:07,675
[SPEAKER_03]: They all have administrative codes that are fairly easy to pull up and look at.

479
00:48:07,695 --> 00:48:07,735
[SPEAKER_03]: So.

480
00:48:08,175 --> 00:48:14,618
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Collins, does that satisfy your question?

481
00:48:17,263 --> 00:48:20,326
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, it directs me to where I should look to get a concrete answer, so thank you for that.

482
00:48:21,407 --> 00:48:21,787
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

483
00:48:22,928 --> 00:48:27,053
[SPEAKER_12]: Do any other councillors have questions or comments on section 5-1?

484
00:48:29,996 --> 00:48:34,480
[SPEAKER_12]: Seeing none, do any councillors have questions about section 5-2, Merit Principles?

485
00:48:41,071 --> 00:48:49,193
[SPEAKER_12]: Seeing none, do any members of the public have any comments on article five on administrative organization?

486
00:48:51,914 --> 00:48:52,534
[SPEAKER_12]: Seeing none.

487
00:48:54,495 --> 00:48:57,535
[SPEAKER_12]: Then moving on, article six, financial procedures.

488
00:48:58,476 --> 00:49:02,797
[SPEAKER_12]: Do any councilors have questions or comments on section 6-1 fiscal year?

489
00:49:07,885 --> 00:49:14,346
[SPEAKER_12]: Seeing none, do any councilors have questions or comments on section 6-2, the annual budget meeting?

490
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:21,207
[SPEAKER_12]: Seeing none, do any councilors have questions?

491
00:49:22,428 --> 00:49:24,088
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, Councilor Callahan.

492
00:49:25,208 --> 00:49:26,868
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, I didn't mean to interrupt you.

493
00:49:27,309 --> 00:49:34,770
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a super quick question about we did pass a budget ordinance and I know that the charter basically is a

494
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:38,141
[SPEAKER_01]: that takes precedence over ordinances in general.

495
00:49:38,981 --> 00:49:45,043
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm curious how you might see this piece of the charter and the ordinance that we passed as interacting with each other.

496
00:49:46,403 --> 00:49:47,684
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you may not know about the ordinance.

497
00:49:47,704 --> 00:49:58,627
[SPEAKER_01]: The ordinance basically lays out a timeline for when the mayor will provide certain information and different meetings that the state council will have with department heads to understand their individual budgets.

498
00:49:59,007 --> 00:50:04,889
[SPEAKER_01]: So it has this more details, and I don't really know if the actual dates are

499
00:50:06,585 --> 00:50:18,176
[SPEAKER_01]: probably not identical to these, but I'm just curious if you have an understanding of how that, would that ordinance kind of be washed away or would that ordinance just be assumed to be fine unless it's specifically against the charter?

500
00:50:19,457 --> 00:50:22,380
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the ordinance would have to be brought into harmony with the charter.

501
00:50:23,261 --> 00:50:23,461
Great.

502
00:50:24,322 --> 00:50:25,283
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

503
00:50:25,403 --> 00:50:27,925
[SPEAKER_12]: I see that President Bears has his hand raised on Zoom.

504
00:50:28,326 --> 00:50:28,546
Thanks.

505
00:50:30,087 --> 00:50:30,968
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, as I read it,

506
00:50:32,022 --> 00:50:37,404
[SPEAKER_11]: we would, this would add a budget meeting earlier than we have in the ordinance as it stands now.

507
00:50:38,164 --> 00:50:43,587
[SPEAKER_11]: And it looks like it might make some small changes to the timelines that we're currently complying with.

508
00:50:44,527 --> 00:50:54,211
[SPEAKER_11]: Chapter 43 or 44, Mass General, I can never remember which one, but we might just need to make some adjustments around the beginning and the end to make sure the dates are in line.

509
00:50:54,271 --> 00:50:59,493
[SPEAKER_11]: But other than that, it doesn't really affect the heart of the budget ordinance around the budget meetings.

510
00:51:02,033 --> 00:51:02,974
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, President Bears.

511
00:51:03,594 --> 00:51:06,616
[SPEAKER_12]: Are there any other questions or comments from councillors?

512
00:51:08,957 --> 00:51:09,558
[SPEAKER_12]: Seeing none.

513
00:51:11,919 --> 00:51:16,823
[SPEAKER_12]: Section 6-3, submission of operating budget message.

514
00:51:18,043 --> 00:51:20,305
[SPEAKER_12]: Do any councillors have questions or comments on that?

515
00:51:23,534 --> 00:51:24,175
[SPEAKER_12]: Seeing none.

516
00:51:25,716 --> 00:51:28,998
[SPEAKER_12]: Section 6-4, action on the operating budget.

517
00:51:29,018 --> 00:51:32,121
[SPEAKER_12]: Do any Councilors have questions or comments on this section?

518
00:51:35,223 --> 00:51:35,903
[SPEAKER_12]: Seeing none.

519
00:51:38,586 --> 00:51:42,248
[SPEAKER_12]: Section 6-5, capital improvement plan.

520
00:51:42,328 --> 00:51:44,950
[SPEAKER_12]: Do any Councilors have questions or comments on this section?

521
00:51:49,594 --> 00:51:50,535
[SPEAKER_12]: Seeing none.

522
00:51:51,915 --> 00:51:54,638
[SPEAKER_12]: Section 6-6, Independent Audit.

523
00:51:54,798 --> 00:51:57,601
[SPEAKER_12]: Do any Councilors have any questions or comments on this section?

524
00:52:01,405 --> 00:52:01,625
[SPEAKER_12]: None?

525
00:52:01,906 --> 00:52:03,828
[SPEAKER_12]: See, we can do things pretty quickly here.

526
00:52:05,609 --> 00:52:09,854
[SPEAKER_12]: Section 6-7, Expenditures and Excess Appropriations.

527
00:52:09,954 --> 00:52:13,418
[SPEAKER_12]: Any Councilors have questions or comments on this section?

528
00:52:15,374 --> 00:52:16,615
[SPEAKER_12]: Seeing none.

529
00:52:17,695 --> 00:52:18,776
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

530
00:52:18,856 --> 00:52:28,240
[SPEAKER_12]: Do any members of the public have any questions or comments about Article 6, the financial procedures?

531
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:32,462
[SPEAKER_12]: I see a hand from Barry Ingber on Zoom.

532
00:52:32,542 --> 00:52:35,263
[SPEAKER_12]: Name and address for the record, please, once we get you unmuted.

533
00:52:41,826 --> 00:52:43,827
[SPEAKER_00]: Barry Ingber, 9 Draper Street.

534
00:52:46,276 --> 00:52:57,179
[SPEAKER_00]: And just very briefly, I'm one of those who perceives a huge imbalance in power between the mayor and the council.

535
00:52:57,319 --> 00:53:12,603
[SPEAKER_00]: And even if it's typical for the mayor council form of government in Medford, it's still a serious imbalance that I think has historically led

536
00:53:13,772 --> 00:53:21,238
[SPEAKER_00]: to decades of conflict between city council and the mayor's office, regardless of who sits in those chairs.

537
00:53:22,399 --> 00:53:34,149
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that one important way of addressing that imbalance would be to give the city council more discretion over the budget by allowing it to create or increase budget lines.

538
00:53:34,870 --> 00:53:37,532
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what the

539
00:53:38,592 --> 00:53:46,541
[SPEAKER_00]: legal parameters around that would be, but I would ask that both the council and the administration consider that.

540
00:53:47,182 --> 00:53:47,582
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

541
00:53:49,324 --> 00:53:50,545
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Barry.

542
00:53:51,206 --> 00:53:54,029
[SPEAKER_12]: Going in person, name and address for the record, please.

543
00:54:01,492 --> 00:54:03,714
[SPEAKER_02]: Matthew Page Lieberman, 15 Canal Street.

544
00:54:05,095 --> 00:54:13,622
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw that it's a recommendation in the Charter Review Group's document that this be considered in the next Charter Review.

545
00:54:14,103 --> 00:54:21,288
[SPEAKER_02]: However, I do feel that it is very unfortunate that participatory budgeting was not included at this iteration.

546
00:54:22,750 --> 00:54:23,490
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Matthew.

547
00:54:26,965 --> 00:54:37,634
[SPEAKER_12]: Seeing no other comments in person or on Zoom, moving on to our last section of the night, article seven, our last article of the night, elections.

548
00:54:38,314 --> 00:54:49,464
[SPEAKER_12]: Do any councilors have, let's take the, we can take sections seven-one and seven-two together since they're both about preliminary elections and preliminary election procedures.

549
00:54:50,184 --> 00:54:51,906
[SPEAKER_12]: Do we have any comments?

550
00:54:52,426 --> 00:54:53,627
[SPEAKER_12]: I see President Bears is on Zoom.

551
00:54:55,131 --> 00:54:55,571
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

552
00:54:55,611 --> 00:55:06,934
[SPEAKER_11]: I just had one, uh, follow up from our last meeting, which was, um, regarding the language around, including elections commission versus city clerk.

553
00:55:07,834 --> 00:55:15,156
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, since we use the election commission model, um, but I also know that the mass general law that we adopted to move to the elections commission.

554
00:55:15,996 --> 00:55:21,217
[SPEAKER_11]: Essentially says that the election commissions culture of the function of the city clerk as it relates to election.

555
00:55:22,251 --> 00:55:38,626
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was wondering if the Collins Center had had a chance to take a look at that and figure out how we should refer to our elections oversight body, the body that conducts elections here in Medford in the charter.

556
00:55:38,646 --> 00:55:44,932
[SPEAKER_12]: Would the Collins Center have an answer to that question?

557
00:55:45,092 --> 00:55:48,255
[SPEAKER_08]: We would change the reference to the Board of Election Commissioners.

558
00:55:50,275 --> 00:55:57,380
[SPEAKER_11]: Great, then I would make a motion to replace the word City Clerk with Board of Election Commissioners throughout Article 7.

559
00:55:59,901 --> 00:56:11,549
[SPEAKER_12]: We have a motion from President Bears to change the references to the City Clerk in Article 7 to Board of Election Commissioners, with a second from Councilor Lazzaro.

560
00:56:12,269 --> 00:56:14,891
[SPEAKER_12]: Do we have any comments on that before we take a vote?

561
00:56:17,513 --> 00:56:21,116
[SPEAKER_12]: Seeing none, when you're ready.

562
00:56:21,396 --> 00:56:21,956
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, yeah.

563
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:26,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Ready.

564
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:27,160
[SPEAKER_11]: Great.

565
00:56:28,862 --> 00:56:29,442
[SPEAKER_04]: President Bears?

566
00:56:30,443 --> 00:56:30,763
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

567
00:56:32,024 --> 00:56:32,765
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Collins?

568
00:56:32,825 --> 00:56:32,885
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

569
00:56:33,786 --> 00:56:34,506
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Lazzaro?

570
00:56:34,546 --> 00:56:34,646
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

571
00:56:35,187 --> 00:56:35,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli?

572
00:56:35,807 --> 00:56:35,887
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

573
00:56:37,929 --> 00:56:38,429
[SPEAKER_04]: Chair Tseng?

574
00:56:38,709 --> 00:56:38,929
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

575
00:56:39,070 --> 00:56:44,194
[SPEAKER_12]: Four in favor, one against.

576
00:56:45,054 --> 00:56:45,715
[SPEAKER_12]: Motion passes.

577
00:56:47,558 --> 00:56:52,880
[SPEAKER_12]: or do we have any other comments on sections 7-1 and 7-2 about preliminary elections?

578
00:56:56,602 --> 00:57:06,907
[SPEAKER_12]: Seeing none, do we have any comments or questions about section 7-3 or section 7-4?

579
00:57:07,467 --> 00:57:14,010
[SPEAKER_12]: That would be regular city election, ballot position, and for that regular city election.

580
00:57:17,969 --> 00:57:21,111
[SPEAKER_12]: Seeing none as well.

581
00:57:21,711 --> 00:57:25,674
[SPEAKER_12]: Moving on to section 7-5, nonpartisan elections.

582
00:57:26,194 --> 00:57:28,955
[SPEAKER_12]: Are there any comments or questions from councilors?

583
00:57:32,738 --> 00:57:33,398
[SPEAKER_12]: Seeing none.

584
00:57:34,619 --> 00:57:36,940
[SPEAKER_12]: Section 7-6, wards.

585
00:57:38,561 --> 00:57:41,983
[SPEAKER_12]: Do we have any comments or questions from councilors?

586
00:57:47,648 --> 00:57:50,369
[SPEAKER_12]: Seeing none, I did have one question.

587
00:57:51,090 --> 00:58:06,036
[SPEAKER_12]: Having followed the last re-precincting conversation in 2020, I believe it was, in the City Council, I know two of the plans submitted by, I believe it was the City Clerk's Office,

588
00:58:07,657 --> 00:58:09,998
[SPEAKER_12]: had nine wards instead of eight.

589
00:58:10,498 --> 00:58:20,060
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, a lot of, you know, a lot of this I think like affects potential composition of city council and, you know, there's a lot of interplay there.

590
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:34,924
[SPEAKER_12]: I was wondering how difficult it would be, you know, if we get to a situation with our very fast population growth here in Medford, where mathematically because of state laws, we have to draw nine wards or we get to a situation where

591
00:58:35,673 --> 00:58:40,275
[SPEAKER_12]: you know we're kind of put in that position, how difficult would it be to change this.

592
00:58:41,456 --> 00:58:47,018
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, you could just bring a special act of the legislature to change the number.

593
00:58:48,359 --> 00:58:53,821
[SPEAKER_08]: And is that something that it wouldn't, it wouldn't be a major undertaking.

594
00:58:55,140 --> 00:59:00,542
[SPEAKER_12]: That's something that the state legislature would probably be pretty deferential to.

595
00:59:00,922 --> 00:59:04,583
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they do understand it because they're elected from these wards too.

596
00:59:04,603 --> 00:59:07,624
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, great.

597
00:59:07,884 --> 00:59:09,524
[SPEAKER_12]: I see President Bears on Zoom.

598
00:59:10,924 --> 00:59:19,747
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, the other option would just be to request from the Secretary of the Commonwealth a map that adds an additional precinct within each ward.

599
00:59:20,850 --> 00:59:25,194
[SPEAKER_11]: We had a proposal that kept us at eight wards, but added a third precinct in each ward.

600
00:59:27,396 --> 00:59:29,178
[SPEAKER_11]: So that would just be another way to do it.

601
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:32,441
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, President Bears.

602
00:59:33,422 --> 00:59:33,722
[SPEAKER_12]: Great.

603
00:59:34,803 --> 00:59:37,926
[SPEAKER_12]: Are there any other questions from councillors on 7-6 on wards?

604
00:59:38,746 --> 00:59:39,267
[SPEAKER_12]: Seeing none.

605
00:59:45,878 --> 00:59:47,459
[SPEAKER_12]: And our final section of the night.

606
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:54,165
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you have any questions or comments from Councilors on section 7-7 application of state general laws?

607
00:59:58,148 --> 01:00:01,811
[SPEAKER_12]: Seeing none, before we close the meeting, I want to open up.

608
01:00:02,212 --> 01:00:03,393
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh yes, President Bears.

609
01:00:04,774 --> 01:00:12,000
[SPEAKER_11]: I just moved to refer the articles discussed tonight with the amendments voted on by the council to committee of the whole.

610
01:00:14,575 --> 01:00:15,476
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, President Bears.

611
01:00:15,556 --> 01:00:24,861
[SPEAKER_12]: We have a motion from President Bears to refer the articles we discussed tonight to the committee, the future committee of the whole that's going to be scheduled.

612
01:00:24,881 --> 01:00:27,082
[SPEAKER_12]: Do we have a second on that motion?

613
01:00:30,384 --> 01:00:31,445
[SPEAKER_11]: Including the amendments.

614
01:00:32,746 --> 01:00:33,586
[SPEAKER_12]: Including the amendments.

615
01:00:36,108 --> 01:00:36,328
[SPEAKER_12]: Great.

616
01:00:38,004 --> 01:00:53,032
[SPEAKER_12]: Do we have any, before we take out that vote, which I assume will be the last substantive vote, do we have any comments from the public about Section 7 elections or general comments about the sections that we discussed tonight?

617
01:01:01,581 --> 01:01:05,164
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of these sections are very difficult to parse.

618
01:01:06,125 --> 01:01:11,369
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm wondering if anybody can take an opportunity to just clarify them a little bit.

619
01:01:11,890 --> 01:01:27,003
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that we should really, people should look before approving this, ask if they can really break it down and explain some of these, you know, just because if people don't understand, you're making it very difficult for those to administer it.

620
01:01:28,572 --> 01:01:30,292
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Matt.

621
01:01:31,373 --> 01:01:40,235
[SPEAKER_12]: I think, you know, this is something that Councilors could maybe work on too, in terms of our summaries, conversations with residents.

622
01:01:40,535 --> 01:01:43,295
[SPEAKER_12]: I know there are Councilors who are more active on social media as well.

623
01:01:44,536 --> 01:01:50,257
[SPEAKER_12]: Perhaps, you know, we can kind of break down some of what is in here for our residents to understand.

624
01:01:50,877 --> 01:01:51,217
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

625
01:01:53,558 --> 01:01:54,438
[SPEAKER_12]: With that being said,

626
01:01:55,898 --> 01:01:59,602
[SPEAKER_12]: If you know further public comment, Mr. Clerk, when you're ready.

627
01:02:00,903 --> 01:02:01,483

[SPEAKER_12]: Four in favor, one opposed, motion passes.

638

639
01:02:17,938 --> 01:02:18,999
[SPEAKER_12]: Motion to adjourn.

640
01:02:19,059 --> 01:02:21,802

01:02:23,918 --> 01:02:25,380
[SPEAKER_12]: We have a second from Councilor Lazzaro.

642
01:02:25,441 --> 01:02:27,844
[SPEAKER_12]: I see Councilor or Vice President Collins.

643
01:02:29,066 --> 01:02:29,347
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

644
01:02:29,367 --> 01:02:32,853
[SPEAKER_06]: I just, before we close out, I just want to thank the representatives from the Collins Center for being here.

645
01:02:32,893 --> 01:02:37,140
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, thank you to the representatives from the Charter Study Committee for being with us through this process.

646
01:02:38,747 --> 01:02:40,629
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I'd like to echo that sentiment.

647
01:02:40,649 --> 01:02:44,692
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you to the Collins Center's representatives for being here.

648
01:02:45,032 --> 01:02:52,178
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you to the members of the Charter Study Committee, both here in person and on Zoom, for participating, for being here.

649
01:02:53,679 --> 01:02:56,762
[SPEAKER_12]: With that being said, I think that's a happy place to close this meeting.

650
