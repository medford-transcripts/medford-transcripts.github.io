1
00:00:00,171 --> 00:00:01,973
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, hello, everybody.

2
00:00:02,033 --> 00:00:03,534
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the Medford Historical Commission.

3
00:00:03,554 --> 00:00:05,616
[SPEAKER_05]: Today is Monday, April 8.

4
00:00:05,716 --> 00:00:06,877
[SPEAKER_05]: It's seven o'clock.

5
00:00:07,357 --> 00:00:08,699
[SPEAKER_05]: Peter, are you good for minutes?

6
00:00:09,311 --> 00:00:09,631
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

7
00:00:10,131 --> 00:00:10,711
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, great.

8
00:00:10,891 --> 00:00:13,332
[SPEAKER_05]: I will call the meeting to order.

9
00:00:13,472 --> 00:00:16,713
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll just do our little phrase here that we need to get going.

10
00:00:17,233 --> 00:00:24,495
[SPEAKER_05]: Pursuant to Chapter 20 of the Acts of 2021, this meeting of the City of Medford Historical Commission will be conducted via remote means.

11
00:00:24,955 --> 00:00:29,816
[SPEAKER_05]: Members of the public who wish to access the meeting may do so by using the Zoom link provided for in the agenda.

12
00:00:30,356 --> 00:00:38,838
[SPEAKER_05]: No in-person attendance of members of the public will be permitted, and public participation in any public hearing during this meeting shall be by remote means only.

13
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:42,260
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

14
00:00:43,981 --> 00:00:47,323
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have a decent agenda tonight.

15
00:00:47,964 --> 00:00:51,827
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll just start, we'll just go in order on our agenda.

16
00:00:52,187 --> 00:00:57,110
[SPEAKER_05]: So first up, we're gonna have a determination of significance for 27 Allmont Street.

17
00:00:57,931 --> 00:01:03,214
[SPEAKER_05]: So just to remind folks how we got here, last month we took an application

18
00:01:05,496 --> 00:01:09,498
[SPEAKER_05]: This is for total demolition of 27 Almond Street.

19
00:01:10,038 --> 00:01:14,480
[SPEAKER_05]: And tonight the commission will determine whether or not the property is historically significant.

20
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:30,368
[SPEAKER_05]: And to remind everybody what that means, it means that the property is importantly associated with one or more historic persons or events, or with the broad architectural, cultural, political, economic, or social history of the city or commonwealth, or,

21
00:01:30,888 --> 00:01:43,932
[SPEAKER_05]: It is historically or architecturally important in terms of period, style, method of building construction, or association with an important architect or builder, either by itself or in the context of a group of buildings.

22
00:01:44,592 --> 00:01:54,555
[SPEAKER_05]: And as always, to remind people, we do not and will not consider the building's condition or any safety issues when determining something is to be significant or preferably preserved.

23
00:01:57,487 --> 00:02:03,532
[SPEAKER_05]: So commissioners if somebody would like to give me a motion for 27 all month we can start the discussion.

24
00:02:05,353 --> 00:02:09,516
[SPEAKER_04]: Make a motion to find 27 all month Street, preferably dot historically significant.

25
00:02:10,097 --> 00:02:10,677
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks right.

26
00:02:16,421 --> 00:02:17,162
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a second.

27
00:02:21,205 --> 00:02:23,987
[SPEAKER_01]: Second motion okay, okay, thanks Peter.

28
00:02:27,268 --> 00:02:32,576
[SPEAKER_05]: Peter, just make a note for the minutes that Doug and Eleni are out both out tonight.

29
00:02:33,338 --> 00:02:33,758
[SPEAKER_03]: I did.

30
00:02:33,818 --> 00:02:34,860
[SPEAKER_05]: I should have said that up front.

31
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:35,461
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

32
00:02:35,481 --> 00:02:37,244
[SPEAKER_05]: I will.

33
00:02:37,965 --> 00:02:39,928
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, Ryan, you made the motion.

34
00:02:40,068 --> 00:02:41,971
[SPEAKER_05]: I will start with you for discussion.

35
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:47,653
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, this is a really well preserved example of Greek Revival architecture.

36
00:02:47,673 --> 00:02:57,025
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got some slightly later features such as the Italian style barge board on the front of the house, but it's largely Greek Revival.

37
00:02:57,786 --> 00:02:59,729
[SPEAKER_04]: It's nice to know that there's an architect

38
00:03:00,029 --> 00:03:09,272
[SPEAKER_04]: or builder associated with the property, and the houses built before 1855 are a rare and diminishing resource.

39
00:03:09,292 --> 00:03:16,594
[SPEAKER_04]: There's probably less than 3,000 pre-1900 buildings, and of that, half of them are pre-1855.

40
00:03:16,815 --> 00:03:22,156
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is right on the cusp, but it's really an important building to the time period of Bedford.

41
00:03:22,216 --> 00:03:27,198
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm 100% behind the preservation of this building.

42
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,369
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, thank you.

43
00:03:31,491 --> 00:03:32,853
[SPEAKER_05]: Peter, I'll come to you next.

44
00:03:34,115 --> 00:03:34,936
[SPEAKER_03]: Agreed.

45
00:03:35,597 --> 00:03:43,728
[SPEAKER_03]: With what Ryan said, it's got a lot of its original, it appears to be original architectural detail.

46
00:03:47,215 --> 00:03:54,946
[SPEAKER_03]: And foundation and the the box was checked on here recommended for listing in national register of historic places.

47
00:03:55,346 --> 00:04:00,773
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't see any backup at the end of the form be on that, but I don't know if I have a current for me, but.

48
00:04:01,558 --> 00:04:02,618
[SPEAKER_05]: I noticed that as well.

49
00:04:02,738 --> 00:04:07,379
[SPEAKER_05]: Ryan, do we know like John usually puts the criteria on there?

50
00:04:07,399 --> 00:04:24,783
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, he may have just not completed it at this point, but the most of the buildings in this neighborhood are recommended for national register and I can go back and look and see if we have an area formed for this area that might encompass that, but I don't.

51
00:04:25,243 --> 00:04:32,129
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think we do, but the general recommendation was most of the buildings, given their age and preservation state are recommended for.

52
00:04:34,671 --> 00:04:35,171
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, great.

53
00:04:37,973 --> 00:04:38,974
[SPEAKER_05]: Was there anything else Peter?

54
00:04:38,994 --> 00:04:40,676
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I mean, it.

55
00:04:42,944 --> 00:04:51,348
[SPEAKER_03]: It was known, the builder's known, and there seem to be some association with the shipbuilding industry, et cetera.

56
00:04:51,428 --> 00:04:55,270
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think this is one that we want to take a pause on.

57
00:04:55,851 --> 00:05:03,915
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's in, it has, you know, an unusual amount of original detail, you know, for a house of this age.

58
00:05:05,215 --> 00:05:10,298
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if it's original, original, but it appears, you know, the exterior casings,

59
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:16,314
[SPEAKER_03]: No vinyl siding you know it's just you don't see that so.

60
00:05:16,334 --> 00:05:25,642
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah I noticed that john on the he called out some interior moldings as well that were original that kind of stuck out to me.

61
00:05:29,345 --> 00:05:30,306
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, thanks Peter.

62
00:05:30,726 --> 00:05:32,408
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah I will come to you next.

63
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:34,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you say me?

64
00:05:35,261 --> 00:05:36,002
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, sorry.

65
00:05:37,043 --> 00:05:50,016
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to note the same association with the shipbuilding industry and also Stephen Bradley, one of the builders, presumably, Ryan, I would assume same Bradley as the Bradley Estate?

66
00:05:52,099 --> 00:05:52,639
[SPEAKER_02]: Possibly.

67
00:05:52,659 --> 00:05:54,421
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a small group of people.

68
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:56,283
[SPEAKER_02]: With that spelling.

69
00:05:56,303 --> 00:05:56,363
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

70
00:05:57,635 --> 00:06:15,812
[SPEAKER_02]: But also I wanted to ask a question of the architects on the group, which is, I noticed the comment about Gothic Revival and it made me think, what's the inventory of Gothic Revival buildings or buildings that have Gothic Revival details?

71
00:06:16,112 --> 00:06:18,274
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that seems pretty small to me in Medford.

72
00:06:18,414 --> 00:06:19,435
[SPEAKER_02]: I can think of one or two.

73
00:06:19,455 --> 00:06:21,357
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

74
00:06:23,373 --> 00:06:24,274
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's smaller.

75
00:06:25,075 --> 00:06:37,012
[SPEAKER_04]: The Great Revival time period kind of takes from, like, just predates that by about 10 years and then they start bringing in, the big highlight is the pointed

76
00:06:39,178 --> 00:06:45,600
[SPEAKER_04]: pediments, so that the top of the pediments are slightly pointed, and then Gothic, they just simply round that out a little bit.

77
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:50,222
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and it's carried through both the Gothic and the Italianate eras.

78
00:06:50,322 --> 00:07:05,707
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, sometimes a lot of people have, the houses will have this dominant gable end form, but they may just have like subtle little details, especially on the inside that distinguish it from a Greek revival or a Italianate house.

79
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:11,961
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are my comments.

80
00:07:12,861 --> 00:07:14,022
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thank you, Kit.

81
00:07:15,003 --> 00:07:15,183
[SPEAKER_05]: Ed?

82
00:07:16,264 --> 00:07:18,146
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have anything more particular to say.

83
00:07:19,046 --> 00:07:19,547
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, great.

84
00:07:20,227 --> 00:07:20,508
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

85
00:07:21,368 --> 00:07:21,769
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

86
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:31,276
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we have all of our commissioner comments in, so I will go around for a roll call vote as I see people on my screen.

87
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:35,260
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a motion to find 27 Alamont Street significant.

88
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:37,321
[SPEAKER_05]: That has been seconded.

89
00:07:37,581 --> 00:07:37,902
[SPEAKER_05]: Peter?

90
00:07:39,653 --> 00:07:41,195
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, for significance.

91
00:07:41,956 --> 00:07:42,416
[SPEAKER_05]: And Kit?

92
00:07:42,717 --> 00:07:42,957
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

93
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:44,238
[SPEAKER_05]: Ryan?

94
00:07:44,538 --> 00:07:44,799
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

95
00:07:45,539 --> 00:07:45,960
[SPEAKER_05]: And Ed?

96
00:07:47,201 --> 00:07:48,322
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, for significance.

97
00:07:49,183 --> 00:07:51,065
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, then the motion passes 4-0.

98
00:07:59,863 --> 00:08:02,985
[SPEAKER_05]: Next month we will hold a preferably preserved hearing for this property.

99
00:08:03,005 --> 00:08:13,191
[SPEAKER_05]: We will email out instructions to put a sign in the yard and we will need a check delivered to City Hall as well for the legal ad in the newspaper.

100
00:08:13,411 --> 00:08:18,855
[SPEAKER_05]: So I will get that information to the property owner by tomorrow.

101
00:08:20,096 --> 00:08:23,077
[SPEAKER_05]: And then Dennis, you and I will talk about the deadline for

102
00:08:23,998 --> 00:08:30,200
[SPEAKER_05]: the transcripts or the herald, whatever we have to do these days because things are so quick.

103
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:45,305
[SPEAKER_01]: If I may inquire only because I just took another look at the application, have we heard anything from the owners or the builders since they filed the demolition delay application?

104
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:45,785
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

105
00:08:49,526 --> 00:08:50,006
[SPEAKER_01]: Fair enough.

106
00:08:52,047 --> 00:08:52,227
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

107
00:08:53,047 --> 00:08:53,267
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

108
00:08:55,307 --> 00:09:07,416
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay moving on next up we have 82 Greenleaf Avenue commissioners we had a heads up on this one there's been a fire at this property so we went ahead and ordered the form be.

109
00:09:07,436 --> 00:09:16,062
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, kind of out of order in the sense that we wanted to kind of get this 1 through the process tonight so tonight we're going to.

110
00:09:16,682 --> 00:09:21,843
[SPEAKER_05]: both take the application and determine significance here because the form B is available.

111
00:09:22,903 --> 00:09:26,504
[SPEAKER_05]: I did send around a link to the file so you should have everything there.

112
00:09:27,344 --> 00:09:38,926
[SPEAKER_05]: And when somebody is ready, I'll start with a motion for the acceptance of the application and then we can go into the discussion on significance.

113
00:09:39,346 --> 00:09:43,507
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll move to accept the application as to form.

114
00:09:44,095 --> 00:09:44,755
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you add.

115
00:09:45,735 --> 00:09:47,556
[SPEAKER_05]: Second okay, thank you can.

116
00:09:52,997 --> 00:10:01,539
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay motion to accept the application for demolition for this for total demolition for 82 Greenleaf Avenue Peter.

117
00:10:02,499 --> 00:10:05,600
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, excuse me, yes.

118
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,481
[SPEAKER_05]: And Ryan, yes, and add.

119
00:10:09,281 --> 00:10:09,541
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

120
00:10:10,345 --> 00:10:19,127
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so we will accept the application for zero and now we will move on to determination of significance.

121
00:10:19,888 --> 00:10:25,549
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll take a motion from one of the commissioners when you're ready for our significance or not here.

122
00:10:26,389 --> 00:10:30,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion to find for significance with the understanding I'm going to shoot it down.

123
00:10:30,951 --> 00:10:31,971
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, thank you, Ryan.

124
00:10:32,871 --> 00:10:34,511
[SPEAKER_01]: Having heard that I will be seconding.

125
00:10:35,172 --> 00:10:36,172
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, thank you, Ed.

126
00:10:38,928 --> 00:10:40,910
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, Ryan, why don't you start the discussion?

127
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:49,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, John was nice enough to document this building's history, but because of the fire loss, I am inclined to let it go.

128
00:10:49,756 --> 00:10:54,880
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the number of changes on this building warrant, you know, the letting go of this building.

129
00:10:57,645 --> 00:10:58,666
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, thank you, Ryan.

130
00:10:58,766 --> 00:10:59,687
[SPEAKER_05]: Ed, anything to add?

131
00:11:00,287 --> 00:11:09,654
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, again, history aside, the rendering of Form B is really just, at this point, just imagining what it could look like.

132
00:11:09,674 --> 00:11:18,521
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think in a situation like this, we're supposed to be doing design review of a rebuild, of an inevitable rebuild.

133
00:11:19,141 --> 00:11:21,123
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm inclined to vote no, not significant.

134
00:11:22,284 --> 00:11:23,164
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, thanks, Ed.

135
00:11:23,825 --> 00:11:25,086
[SPEAKER_05]: Peter, anything to add here?

136
00:11:27,448 --> 00:11:37,011
[SPEAKER_03]: Only a small anecdote that I was present the morning of the fire, walking my dog past the house, and it was a pretty serious fire.

137
00:11:39,912 --> 00:11:42,832
[SPEAKER_03]: So I doubt if there's anything left.

138
00:11:42,912 --> 00:11:50,415
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the house was already altered significantly, like the entire facade was replaced, et cetera.

139
00:11:53,478 --> 00:11:56,780
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the only reason I would want to see it voted.

140
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:03,043
[SPEAKER_03]: For significance is for, you know, design review, but I don't think that that.

141
00:12:04,904 --> 00:12:08,606
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a worthy reason at this point, so.

142
00:12:09,726 --> 00:12:14,869
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I noticed 2 and looking at the form B and, you know, they're like, oh, it's queen and and I'm like.

143
00:12:17,386 --> 00:12:18,667
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, maybe it once was.

144
00:12:18,887 --> 00:12:19,668
[SPEAKER_05]: It once was.

145
00:12:19,748 --> 00:12:21,029
[SPEAKER_05]: It had that flat front.

146
00:12:21,129 --> 00:12:29,174
[SPEAKER_05]: So I certainly had made the comment in my head as well that it had already undergone some significant changes over the years.

147
00:12:29,255 --> 00:12:32,037
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah.

148
00:12:32,117 --> 00:12:33,818
[SPEAKER_05]: Kit, do you have anything to add on this one?

149
00:12:34,298 --> 00:12:34,678
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't.

150
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:45,166
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't think it's our role to, I don't know who said it, but I don't think it's our role to be the design review on this one.

151
00:12:45,946 --> 00:12:46,167
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

152
00:12:46,982 --> 00:12:47,502
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, great.

153
00:12:48,122 --> 00:12:56,045
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so we have a motion on the table to find for significance for 82 Greenleaf Avenue that has been seconded.

154
00:12:56,185 --> 00:12:57,905
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll go around for a roll call vote.

155
00:12:58,505 --> 00:12:58,886
[SPEAKER_05]: Peter?

156
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:01,926
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

157
00:13:02,827 --> 00:13:03,107
[SPEAKER_05]: Kit?

158
00:13:03,627 --> 00:13:03,847
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

159
00:13:04,667 --> 00:13:05,087
[SPEAKER_05]: Ryan?

160
00:13:05,447 --> 00:13:05,688
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

161
00:13:06,488 --> 00:13:06,888
[SPEAKER_05]: And Ed?

162
00:13:07,428 --> 00:13:09,129
[SPEAKER_01]: No, understanding for no significance.

163
00:13:09,609 --> 00:13:09,969
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

164
00:13:10,409 --> 00:13:13,470
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so the motion fails zero to four.

165
00:13:15,173 --> 00:13:21,657
[SPEAKER_05]: Great, so that one will get the owners on their merry way for that so that they can start their rebuild.

166
00:13:23,218 --> 00:13:23,938
[SPEAKER_05]: Fantastic.

167
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:26,900
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, moving right along.

168
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,963
[SPEAKER_05]: We have an application for 289 Fells Way West.

169
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:34,364
[SPEAKER_05]: Commissioner, it's just a little background.

170
00:13:34,945 --> 00:13:38,207
[SPEAKER_05]: This one, they had started to do work on the property.

171
00:13:40,871 --> 00:13:47,253
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of inadvertently came down according to the building department, but apparently was in pretty bad shape anyway.

172
00:13:47,273 --> 00:13:56,455
[SPEAKER_05]: So we did get an app, you know, the building department halted the project and diverted them over to us for review.

173
00:14:01,816 --> 00:14:04,257
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, we're just merely going to accept the application.

174
00:14:05,028 --> 00:14:07,111
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, that is the plan.

175
00:14:07,131 --> 00:14:11,376
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that was the intent for them to apply for demolition.

176
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:21,829
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, just so I understand, the photographs which were submitted with the application, were they now the currently existing conditions?

177
00:14:22,848 --> 00:14:28,752
[SPEAKER_05]: So I asked them, they had said that they didn't really have any photos because the house was mostly gone.

178
00:14:28,792 --> 00:14:37,157
[SPEAKER_05]: And I asked them if they had any photos of what it looked like, just so we could get a sense of, you know, this was what was standing.

179
00:14:37,758 --> 00:14:49,005
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a little bit of a mix of, you know, you can see where there's one wall still standing, and then there's some other photos that look like it's more intact that does not exist anymore.

180
00:14:50,993 --> 00:14:55,335
[SPEAKER_01]: would that understanding move to accept the application as to form?

181
00:14:57,356 --> 00:14:58,017
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Ed.

182
00:15:00,538 --> 00:15:01,399
[SPEAKER_04]: Point of clarification?

183
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:03,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Ryan, go ahead.

184
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,182
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the building's not standing, I did talk with John Clemson.

185
00:15:07,282 --> 00:15:12,364
[SPEAKER_04]: He was not going to be able to reconstruct this building.

186
00:15:12,564 --> 00:15:19,108
[SPEAKER_04]: And what he suggested was that we consider putting some time and effort into documenting the

187
00:15:19,608 --> 00:15:23,771
[SPEAKER_04]: larger group of buildings that it's a part of, the ones that are around it that are still standing.

188
00:15:25,152 --> 00:15:36,180
[SPEAKER_04]: I would recommend to the commissioners that we pass on review because there's nothing left to this building at this point.

189
00:15:37,121 --> 00:15:38,262
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I would agree.

190
00:15:38,322 --> 00:15:48,710
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to suggest the same that we accept the demolition application and then maybe have a second motion to pass on review.

191
00:15:49,779 --> 00:15:50,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, yeah, I'm fine with that.

192
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,181
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if that's okay.

193
00:15:53,601 --> 00:16:00,124
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we should accept the application because theoretically before they started demoing this building, it would have come before us.

194
00:16:00,204 --> 00:16:04,266
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a pre-1900 building, not by much, but it is pre-1900 building, so.

195
00:16:06,867 --> 00:16:14,010
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so then why don't we, yeah, and they took the time to send the application, so I think that we should accept it and act on it, so.

196
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:16,952
[SPEAKER_04]: So with that, I'll second the application.

197
00:16:17,483 --> 00:16:18,564
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, thank you, Ryan.

198
00:16:18,724 --> 00:16:25,267
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so we have a motion on the table to receive the demolition application for 289 Fellows Way West.

199
00:16:25,968 --> 00:16:26,308
[SPEAKER_05]: Peter?

200
00:16:27,809 --> 00:16:30,370
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, to accept the demolition application.

201
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:31,450
[SPEAKER_05]: And Kit?

202
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:32,051
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

203
00:16:32,771 --> 00:16:33,151
[SPEAKER_05]: Ryan?

204
00:16:33,612 --> 00:16:33,832
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

205
00:16:34,472 --> 00:16:34,932
[SPEAKER_05]: And Ed?

206
00:16:36,093 --> 00:16:37,013
[SPEAKER_01]: Moved, yes.

207
00:16:37,954 --> 00:16:42,997
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, and then does somebody want to make a motion to pass on review?

208
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:43,897
[SPEAKER_03]: So moved.

209
00:16:45,018 --> 00:16:45,358
[SPEAKER_03]: Second.

210
00:16:46,809 --> 00:16:51,633
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, motion on the table to pass on review for 289 Fells Way West.

211
00:16:51,753 --> 00:16:52,173
[SPEAKER_05]: Peter?

212
00:16:53,314 --> 00:16:53,674
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

213
00:16:54,455 --> 00:16:54,895
[SPEAKER_05]: And Kit?

214
00:16:55,355 --> 00:16:55,616
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

215
00:16:56,216 --> 00:16:56,636
[SPEAKER_05]: Ryan?

216
00:16:56,917 --> 00:16:57,177
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

217
00:16:57,737 --> 00:16:58,158
[SPEAKER_05]: And Ed?

218
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:03,422
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, particularly looking at the Google Maps picture, which may have predated the collapse.

219
00:17:04,502 --> 00:17:04,783
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

220
00:17:05,443 --> 00:17:07,445
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so we will pass on review

221
00:17:13,218 --> 00:17:19,461
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so we'll get a letter out to that homeowner letting him know that he can move forward with this project.

222
00:17:20,202 --> 00:17:27,445
[SPEAKER_05]: And I, Ryan, should we, do we wanna make a motion to get a form, get some?

223
00:17:27,465 --> 00:17:31,407
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have to make motions, we have a standing order to just do it, so.

224
00:17:32,007 --> 00:17:33,088
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay, okay.

225
00:17:35,576 --> 00:17:36,137
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, okay.

226
00:17:36,197 --> 00:17:43,944
[SPEAKER_05]: We should also, there was another fire property that came in today on the permitting that we should add to that list.

227
00:17:44,425 --> 00:17:44,765
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is?

228
00:17:45,686 --> 00:17:48,108
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was Pleasant Street.

229
00:17:48,369 --> 00:17:48,569
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

230
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:50,831
[SPEAKER_05]: The one on the corner of Riverside.

231
00:17:50,851 --> 00:17:50,931
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

232
00:17:51,352 --> 00:17:56,537
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, 3 Pleasant Street.

233
00:18:01,354 --> 00:18:04,338
[SPEAKER_05]: So we can be ready for that one next month if we get their paperwork.

234
00:18:12,067 --> 00:18:12,347
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

235
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:17,413
[SPEAKER_05]: Next up, we have an application to receive for 18 Wedgmere Road.

236
00:18:20,277 --> 00:18:31,785
[SPEAKER_05]: And commissioners I sent around that paperwork that's a partial demo if I remember correctly the property owner is seeking to potentially add on a second story.

237
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:40,732
[SPEAKER_03]: Move to accept the demolition application.

238
00:18:41,372 --> 00:18:42,313
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

239
00:18:43,353 --> 00:18:45,255
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll take ads, thank you Peter and add.

240
00:18:49,251 --> 00:18:55,213
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, we have a motion to accept the demo application for 18 Wedgmere Road that has been seconded.

241
00:18:56,253 --> 00:18:56,633
[SPEAKER_05]: Peter?

242
00:18:57,694 --> 00:18:58,014
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

243
00:18:58,654 --> 00:18:59,094
[SPEAKER_05]: And Kit?

244
00:18:59,414 --> 00:18:59,674
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

245
00:19:00,374 --> 00:19:00,775
[SPEAKER_05]: Ryan?

246
00:19:01,095 --> 00:19:01,355
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

247
00:19:02,075 --> 00:19:02,455
[SPEAKER_05]: And Ed?

248
00:19:03,015 --> 00:19:03,835
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that's the form.

249
00:19:04,356 --> 00:19:04,636
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

250
00:19:05,136 --> 00:19:11,618
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so we'll get a form created for this property and next month we will have a significance hearing on this one.

251
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:19,535
[SPEAKER_05]: And similar situation for 9 Trout Avenue, which is our next case on the on our agenda.

252
00:19:20,856 --> 00:19:23,639
[SPEAKER_05]: Also roof change on this one as well.

253
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,682
[SPEAKER_05]: And they did there a little bit farther down on there.

254
00:19:27,702 --> 00:19:31,105
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's some plans and things in the file if folks want to take a look at that.

255
00:19:32,466 --> 00:19:33,346
[SPEAKER_05]: For the application.

256
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:40,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Move to accept the application as submitted.

257
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:41,630
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, thanks Ryan.

258
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:42,870
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, thank you, Kit.

259
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:51,892
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, motion on the table to accept the application for 9 Trout Avenue that has been seconded.

260
00:19:53,092 --> 00:19:53,452
[SPEAKER_05]: Peter?

261
00:19:54,433 --> 00:19:54,773
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

262
00:19:55,493 --> 00:19:55,913
[SPEAKER_05]: And Kit?

263
00:19:56,173 --> 00:19:56,413
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

264
00:19:57,153 --> 00:19:57,573
[SPEAKER_05]: Ryan?

265
00:19:57,933 --> 00:19:58,193
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

266
00:19:58,853 --> 00:19:59,254
[SPEAKER_05]: And Ed?

267
00:20:00,694 --> 00:20:01,454
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes is the form.

268
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:06,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so we will have a significance hearing for that property as well next month.

269
00:20:09,424 --> 00:20:18,273
[SPEAKER_05]: So next month we'll have preferably preserved for 27 Allmont and then two significances for Wedgmere and Trout Avenue.

270
00:20:18,293 --> 00:20:22,578
[SPEAKER_05]: You got all that Peter?

271
00:20:24,019 --> 00:20:24,420
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

272
00:20:25,341 --> 00:20:27,163
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything passed 4-0.

273
00:20:28,764 --> 00:20:29,565
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes it easy.

274
00:20:29,785 --> 00:20:30,706
[SPEAKER_05]: Makes it easy, yes.

275
00:20:32,821 --> 00:20:46,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, just before we have the building commissioner on, I just want to see, does anybody else have any new business as it pertains to demo delay or cases before we move on from those?

276
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:48,630
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

277
00:20:50,092 --> 00:20:54,715
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I wanted to welcome our building commissioner here, Scott Vandewall.

278
00:20:54,755 --> 00:20:56,336
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much for joining us.

279
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:58,438
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

280
00:20:58,918 --> 00:21:11,647
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, and we were kind of emailing back and forth and thought it would be good to have him come on and kind of introduce himself to us and get a little, you got a little flavor here of how we work.

281
00:21:12,427 --> 00:21:23,864
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, in our process, but, you know, just wanted to we've had such great working relationships with our previous commissioners and, you know, wanted to continue that, um, as well.

282
00:21:23,984 --> 00:21:27,389
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um, I will let you have the floor.

283
00:21:27,934 --> 00:21:28,434
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you.

284
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:30,877
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we all want to continue that as well.

285
00:21:31,918 --> 00:21:34,240
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm about eight weeks in here, Medford.

286
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:41,567
[SPEAKER_00]: I do come from Salisbury, which has very minimalist historic area, but it does have some.

287
00:21:42,227 --> 00:21:45,370
[SPEAKER_00]: So we didn't have much of a historical commission.

288
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:48,033
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm kind of looking forward to getting involved with this one here.

289
00:21:48,973 --> 00:21:49,914
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be fun.

290
00:21:50,234 --> 00:22:02,081
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, most of our conversations will probably come around properties that have suffered some sort of damage and how we move forward and that sort of like Three Pleasant, which is when they'll come to you next.

291
00:22:02,181 --> 00:22:08,944
[SPEAKER_00]: It suffered a significant fire a few weeks ago, just as 82 Greenleaf did.

292
00:22:08,964 --> 00:22:12,727
[SPEAKER_00]: We've actually had several fires lately, so we may see more.

293
00:22:14,007 --> 00:22:17,910
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always here to try to be helpful and always ready to work with folks.

294
00:22:19,231 --> 00:22:20,873
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to do work in concert.

295
00:22:21,153 --> 00:22:23,174
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care to work against anybody.

296
00:22:23,795 --> 00:22:27,578
[SPEAKER_00]: We all have our needs and our stuff, so I'm happy to be here.

297
00:22:28,232 --> 00:22:28,552
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

298
00:22:28,912 --> 00:22:29,293
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

299
00:22:29,373 --> 00:22:31,774
[SPEAKER_05]: And we chatted a little bit just for the commissioners.

300
00:22:31,814 --> 00:22:33,255
[SPEAKER_05]: We chatted a little bit the other day.

301
00:22:33,355 --> 00:22:43,702
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, I think our biggest challenge in the past has been really pertaining to partial demolitions and, you know, the subjectivity in that.

302
00:22:43,902 --> 00:22:48,265
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, our our biggest thing is, you know, the.

303
00:22:49,105 --> 00:22:53,829
[SPEAKER_05]: the kind of the, and we're, to be very clear, we are not anti-development here.

304
00:22:54,609 --> 00:23:08,040
[SPEAKER_05]: Every job that all of us have touches real estate in some way, whether it's architecture, real estate, you know, archivist, attorney, you know, and we would be out of a job if not for, you know, what our developers do.

305
00:23:09,281 --> 00:23:11,602
[SPEAKER_05]: But we, you know, we're all about balance, right?

306
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:16,166
[SPEAKER_05]: And preserving our historic resources and really, you know,

307
00:23:17,547 --> 00:23:26,394
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, keeping our neighborhoods looking, you know, as they can and preserving where we can and honoring where we can.

308
00:23:26,494 --> 00:23:37,864
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think there's always that balance of, you know, something is not bad enough to tear down, but we'd love to see it saved in some way, shape or form.

309
00:23:39,445 --> 00:23:43,689
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it was nice to have our conversation the other day where, you know,

310
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:46,050
[SPEAKER_05]: You know how they are.

311
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:47,771
[SPEAKER_05]: They're like, oh, it's going to fall down tomorrow.

312
00:23:47,791 --> 00:23:51,312
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to just condemn it.

313
00:23:51,352 --> 00:23:51,933
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.

314
00:23:51,953 --> 00:23:54,754
[SPEAKER_00]: Developers and builders have a very different perspective.

315
00:23:54,834 --> 00:23:56,915
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't say it's fully grounded in reality.

316
00:23:57,915 --> 00:24:06,059
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll try to tread the middle distance between them and make sure they have their time to speak with you folks whenever it's appropriate.

317
00:24:08,861 --> 00:24:10,563
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always sort of err on the side.

318
00:24:10,624 --> 00:24:13,007
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's any questions, go speak to a committee.

319
00:24:13,428 --> 00:24:19,237
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the local folks who live in the community and have the strongest voice about the community.

320
00:24:19,397 --> 00:24:20,438
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to be that one.

321
00:24:20,478 --> 00:24:22,682
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm not sure, just go speak to the folks.

322
00:24:22,702 --> 00:24:23,703
[SPEAKER_00]: They're happy to talk to you.

323
00:24:24,624 --> 00:24:33,968
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and we welcome, I mean, anybody that comes to us, we're welcome to kind of talk to them, guide them if they're thinking about doing something, have a plan.

324
00:24:33,988 --> 00:24:38,610
[SPEAKER_05]: Ryan and I typically kind of monitor the email.

325
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:47,754
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't speak for the whole board, but we can kind of give you a sense of, give any owner a sense like, yeah, that would fly, that might not fly, that might get delayed, that might not get, you know.

326
00:24:48,394 --> 00:24:57,302
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think, yeah, I think our biggest challenge is in the past of where things have just, you know, gone around us all together.

327
00:24:57,522 --> 00:25:08,692
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's, you know, all we ask is that we have the opportunity to review and, you know, just do the process as we talked about the other day.

328
00:25:10,153 --> 00:25:23,179
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been talking with the mayor and their staff about some revisions we need to make to our permitting programs and stuff, and it'll lean more towards making sure we reach out to everybody rather than us deciding if and when and not.

329
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:26,681
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just reach out and let everybody work through the process.

330
00:25:27,461 --> 00:25:34,745
[SPEAKER_00]: It will hopefully become more functional and cooperative with you and others, and we'll let everybody have their moment.

331
00:25:35,555 --> 00:25:40,501
[SPEAKER_05]: Great great commissioners is anybody have a question or comment or anything for.

332
00:25:40,521 --> 00:25:42,423
[SPEAKER_05]: For Scott.

333
00:25:46,388 --> 00:25:50,653
[SPEAKER_05]: No, we are missing 2 members tonight, so we're moving along pretty quickly.

334
00:25:53,024 --> 00:26:06,874
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing about process, and I'm not sure where the responsibility lies, is a lot of our applications are basically, we want to keep the look of the house, but we need another foot in the second floor today.

335
00:26:07,375 --> 00:26:12,399
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to take out, although that probably wouldn't be our jurisdiction, we need to take a foot out of the basement.

336
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:17,803
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, how do you sort of get that set, you know, even with

337
00:26:18,908 --> 00:26:26,054
[SPEAKER_01]: some concern for design, you know, more expedited, I guess, you know, because that's probably 30 to 40% of the cases coming in right now.

338
00:26:28,113 --> 00:26:34,095
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I since I've only been eight weeks, I'm going to say I'm going to plead a little bit unclear on how we want to do that.

339
00:26:34,235 --> 00:26:41,937
[SPEAKER_00]: I think as we get into this and Jennifer and I work back and forth, like she said, we've had a few conversations.

340
00:26:42,317 --> 00:26:48,759
[SPEAKER_00]: We had heavy conversations about Greenleaf Avenue because that sort of popped up on my plate very early on.

341
00:26:48,779 --> 00:26:53,920
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's continuing to understand what you guys want.

342
00:26:54,040 --> 00:27:00,627
[SPEAKER_00]: to do and how you want to function with it and figuring out how to integrate that in with the decisions that we have to make on our end.

343
00:27:00,787 --> 00:27:06,093
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just going to come with a little bit more time, a little bit more just understanding the process.

344
00:27:07,474 --> 00:27:09,536
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, Salisbury really didn't have

345
00:27:10,477 --> 00:27:11,558
[SPEAKER_00]: historical district.

346
00:27:12,058 --> 00:27:16,780
[SPEAKER_00]: Other communities have historical districts and they're very strong.

347
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,120
[SPEAKER_00]: I think of Marblehead as having a reputation.

348
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:27,984
[SPEAKER_00]: So somewhere in between it seems to be you folks and we just have to learn to figure out where you will fit in the process and we'll work to fit the process into you.

349
00:27:30,882 --> 00:27:31,162
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

350
00:27:32,002 --> 00:27:32,302
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

351
00:27:32,802 --> 00:27:33,983
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we look forward to it.

352
00:27:34,083 --> 00:27:35,383
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome to Medford.

353
00:27:35,883 --> 00:27:39,304
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully your first eight weeks have been somewhat smooth.

354
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:41,045
[SPEAKER_00]: Smooth and busy.

355
00:27:41,065 --> 00:27:42,305
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot to be done.

356
00:27:42,565 --> 00:27:43,205
[SPEAKER_05]: Busy is good.

357
00:27:43,245 --> 00:27:44,866
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, there's a lot to be done.

358
00:27:45,546 --> 00:27:49,847
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have such great people, I think, all around.

359
00:27:49,867 --> 00:27:53,788
[SPEAKER_05]: And boards, commissions, city hall, everybody that volunteers.

360
00:27:55,407 --> 00:28:01,130
[SPEAKER_05]: works, so we're lucky that we all want to make Medford a great place to continue to be, so.

361
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:02,451
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you.

362
00:28:02,691 --> 00:28:08,454
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for coming, and you're welcome to obviously stay as long as you'd like, and we're going to continue on with our meeting.

363
00:28:08,474 --> 00:28:09,494
[SPEAKER_05]: I might just sit and listen.

364
00:28:09,514 --> 00:28:09,895
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, have at it.

365
00:28:09,915 --> 00:28:13,236
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps me gain perspective and context, and this is all about it.

366
00:28:14,057 --> 00:28:14,437
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

367
00:28:14,997 --> 00:28:15,357
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

368
00:28:15,838 --> 00:28:16,178
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

369
00:28:16,838 --> 00:28:17,318
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

370
00:28:17,338 --> 00:28:18,739
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

371
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:21,360
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, guys, moving right along.

372
00:28:23,312 --> 00:28:26,817
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, anything properties currently under demo delay?

373
00:28:26,877 --> 00:28:28,299
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know that we have any updates.

374
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:35,735
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, well, we're actually going to talk to the subcommittee is going to talk to 56 Wareham later tonight.

375
00:28:35,895 --> 00:28:43,002
[SPEAKER_05]: They have reached out and wanted to kind of talk through some initial design that is under demo delay.

376
00:28:43,122 --> 00:28:49,668
[SPEAKER_05]: So Peter and Ryan, myself, we can, we'll stay on the call and they'll come on later.

377
00:28:49,688 --> 00:28:53,771
[SPEAKER_05]: So we can potentially lift them sooner than the 18 months.

378
00:28:56,778 --> 00:29:00,140
[SPEAKER_05]: And Ryan, we haven't heard anything from Winchester Street, right?

379
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:05,443
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, that one only has, well, it still has a ways to go.

380
00:29:05,463 --> 00:29:08,345
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

381
00:29:12,788 --> 00:29:16,390
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing was still, you know, permits, we're still getting assigned permits.

382
00:29:17,251 --> 00:29:23,655
[SPEAKER_05]: They've been a little trickle here and there, but I am sure as Scott gets up and running, some more things might get diverted to us.

383
00:29:24,348 --> 00:29:26,290
[SPEAKER_05]: And don't be shy, you can send them over.

384
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:29,693
[SPEAKER_05]: Ryan and I try to tackle them once a week to keep them moving.

385
00:29:30,954 --> 00:29:40,644
[SPEAKER_05]: So when in doubt, just put it over to us and we'll either let it go or ask for them to submit an application for a formal review.

386
00:29:40,664 --> 00:29:46,630
[SPEAKER_05]: Ryan, do you wanna update on the Cross Street Project?

387
00:29:48,267 --> 00:29:53,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the CPC accounting is done.

388
00:29:53,331 --> 00:30:00,736
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they're just waiting for the financial department to pull the trigger and then there's a grant account that needs to be set up.

389
00:30:01,416 --> 00:30:05,979
[SPEAKER_04]: And as soon as that's set up, then we can get the headstone restoration project underway the.

390
00:30:09,091 --> 00:30:17,297
[SPEAKER_04]: The other project, the archaeological dig at the old cemetery site is in the works.

391
00:30:17,397 --> 00:30:20,039
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm in the process of drafting the invitation for bid.

392
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:24,242
[SPEAKER_04]: I have the scope of work, but I need to revise it to make sure it meets procurement.

393
00:30:24,262 --> 00:30:25,683
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm working with Fiona on that.

394
00:30:26,044 --> 00:30:31,848
[SPEAKER_04]: As soon as we have that, then we can go out to bid and get quotes for the work.

395
00:30:31,888 --> 00:30:37,732
[SPEAKER_04]: And then once we select the lowest qualified bidder, then we will get underway there.

396
00:30:39,819 --> 00:30:45,603
[SPEAKER_01]: When you say there are procurement issues and hiring an archeologist, what does that mean?

397
00:30:45,983 --> 00:31:04,933
[SPEAKER_04]: So because it involves excavation, we have to format the invitation for bid to include some information about requirements for OSHA and just safety things to protect the city during those processes.

398
00:31:05,093 --> 00:31:08,195
[SPEAKER_04]: And because it involves excavation, it's gonna be required to

399
00:31:08,895 --> 00:31:18,372
[SPEAKER_04]: The bid for the excavation work, um, that, uh, what's the right word I'm looking for?

400
00:31:21,475 --> 00:31:25,558
[SPEAKER_04]: it's not competitive wages, the prevailing wages, that's the word.

401
00:31:25,718 --> 00:31:27,440
[SPEAKER_04]: It's gonna be a bid with prevailing wage.

402
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:36,347
[SPEAKER_04]: So the archeological work will be one, basically, they'll have a subcontractor, but that subcontractor is responsible for being paid prevailing wage.

403
00:31:36,467 --> 00:31:39,890
[SPEAKER_04]: So it just makes it fair for everybody, because they're all being paid the same rate.

404
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:44,053
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, it's just a matter of how much time they feel they need for excavating.

405
00:31:44,153 --> 00:31:48,416
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so essentially, we are still hiring a social scientist who knows how to hire.

406
00:31:50,037 --> 00:31:50,538
[SPEAKER_01]: Excavator.

407
00:31:50,878 --> 00:31:51,278
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct.

408
00:31:51,358 --> 00:31:51,618
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

409
00:31:51,658 --> 00:31:57,721
[SPEAKER_04]: The city DPW didn't have enough time to commit to the four days of digging.

410
00:31:58,662 --> 00:32:02,564
[SPEAKER_04]: We just put it on the consultants to give us a ballpark figure.

411
00:32:02,844 --> 00:32:14,170
[SPEAKER_04]: The whole project should see somewhere in the vicinity of $35,000 to go in the ground to do the trenching and to check the site.

412
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:16,191
[SPEAKER_04]: It also came to light during some recent

413
00:32:17,952 --> 00:32:36,104
[SPEAKER_04]: understandings that if the city should sell that particular site, given that the state gave it to them in 1994 after working on deaccessioning it to them, they're required to pay the state fair market value for that price, for that parcel.

414
00:32:36,564 --> 00:32:44,069
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'd be interested to know whether that's fair market value of the date that they gave it to them or whether that's fair market value for the price of the parcel today.

415
00:32:49,049 --> 00:32:51,210
[SPEAKER_05]: let's hope it's the earlier version.

416
00:32:51,230 --> 00:33:00,655
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'd like to think it's maybe- But do they put in, even if it's not appraised as of 2024, is there an inflation kicker as of 1994?

417
00:33:01,336 --> 00:33:03,717
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I don't know.

418
00:33:04,458 --> 00:33:11,742
[SPEAKER_04]: The city was talking about turning that particular area into a parking lot and recreational facility of some kind.

419
00:33:11,822 --> 00:33:14,243
[SPEAKER_04]: So they may not actually end up selling it.

420
00:33:14,883 --> 00:33:17,105
[SPEAKER_04]: So that kind of avoids that issue.

421
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:19,902
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll say the call of the musicians.

422
00:33:23,025 --> 00:33:30,752
[SPEAKER_02]: Ryan, just to be clear about the history, so that was presumably private property that was taken by the state and deaccessioned to the city.

423
00:33:31,418 --> 00:33:39,264
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a cemetery that was in the city's possession from 1811 to 1957.

424
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:54,656
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the first parcel taken for eminent domain in Medford because they had to figure out what they were going to do with it, which was ultimately, the city told them, you want the highway to come through, so you relocate it.

425
00:33:54,736 --> 00:33:55,217
[SPEAKER_04]: So they did.

426
00:33:55,997 --> 00:33:59,638
[SPEAKER_04]: And the city came up with a location for them to relocate.

427
00:33:59,778 --> 00:34:05,339
[SPEAKER_04]: And they then used the site for construction staging.

428
00:34:06,039 --> 00:34:12,981
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess the site was kind of vacant up until 1980 or so.

429
00:34:13,241 --> 00:34:16,862
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they put in a commuter parking lot.

430
00:34:17,162 --> 00:34:20,483
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's when the ring road went in around Medford Square.

431
00:34:22,543 --> 00:34:31,886
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the time that it first got paved and then after that, it's just been used as a commuter lot and then it got kind of absorbed into the hotel project there.

432
00:34:32,246 --> 00:34:34,807
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the high uses it as overflow parking as well.

433
00:34:36,607 --> 00:34:41,789
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was city property that was taken by the state, then given back to the city.

434
00:34:42,129 --> 00:34:42,289
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

435
00:34:43,537 --> 00:34:55,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, in 1985, the McGlynn administration petitioned the state to transfer the property to Medford because Medford wanted to use it as additional parking for City Hall.

436
00:34:56,643 --> 00:35:08,948
[SPEAKER_04]: And it took them from 1986 to 1993 to actually go through the executive channels, because it required approval from the feds and the state, because it was a federally built highway project.

437
00:35:11,345 --> 00:35:15,266
[SPEAKER_04]: once they got their okay, they were finally able to transfer it in 1994.

438
00:35:17,026 --> 00:35:20,507
[SPEAKER_02]: Did the city of Medford ever receive any money for that property?

439
00:35:21,548 --> 00:35:32,330
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think so, but I believe that they were compensated in the way that the state agreed to move the cemetery.

440
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:34,251
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was a $80,000 proposition then, which is a lot of money.

441
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:45,763
[SPEAKER_02]: It's interesting to think about what the fair market value is.

442
00:35:48,264 --> 00:36:00,353
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm sure that question will be made available to the general public when they decide to assess all the parcels for deaccessioning or even whatever they plan to do.

443
00:36:00,433 --> 00:36:03,435
[SPEAKER_04]: I would assume that they would have a fair market assessment of each one of them.

444
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:06,637
[SPEAKER_05]: Or they'll just use the current tax value.

445
00:36:08,107 --> 00:36:10,108
[SPEAKER_04]: which is nil in this case, right?

446
00:36:10,148 --> 00:36:11,708
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's not, it doesn't have any.

447
00:36:12,008 --> 00:36:15,069
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's still, every parcel still has an assessment.

448
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:17,330
[SPEAKER_05]: So they'll make one.

449
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:23,952
[SPEAKER_01]: But part of it is gonna be contingent on what they zone it for or what people believe it will be zoned for.

450
00:36:23,972 --> 00:36:37,077
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, right now it's, you know, it's vacant land with, you know, it's been vacant land for 40 years and no particular connection besides parking to the street grid or anything else.

451
00:36:39,370 --> 00:36:42,052
[SPEAKER_02]: And it may not be as vacant as everybody thinks, right?

452
00:36:43,293 --> 00:36:43,673
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

453
00:36:43,714 --> 00:36:46,276
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking above ground.

454
00:36:46,296 --> 00:36:47,096
[SPEAKER_05]: Above ground.

455
00:36:47,657 --> 00:36:48,958
[SPEAKER_02]: Above ground is vacant, sure.

456
00:36:49,979 --> 00:36:52,060
[SPEAKER_02]: Subterraneously, it might be a little different.

457
00:36:53,301 --> 00:36:55,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

458
00:36:55,683 --> 00:36:59,906
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's pray it's not, but we'll cross that bridge if we get to it.

459
00:37:00,987 --> 00:37:04,770
[SPEAKER_04]: Approaching it as it's not vacant until I see it in the ground.

460
00:37:05,531 --> 00:37:06,572
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah.

461
00:37:07,247 --> 00:37:14,834
[SPEAKER_04]: where I would rather plan for disaster than to let disaster just rear its head.

462
00:37:15,414 --> 00:37:20,999
[SPEAKER_01]: I think by your definition of disaster, we certainly need to plan for it.

463
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:24,082
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

464
00:37:24,102 --> 00:37:26,124
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

465
00:37:26,424 --> 00:37:26,784
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

466
00:37:28,063 --> 00:37:32,009
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so the next update for CPA for Thomas Brooks Park.

467
00:37:33,692 --> 00:37:35,494
[SPEAKER_05]: Did we get our money, Ryan?

468
00:37:35,514 --> 00:37:35,995
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we know?

469
00:37:36,015 --> 00:37:39,280
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's... Is it tomorrow night?

470
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:39,861
[SPEAKER_04]: Tomorrow.

471
00:37:40,041 --> 00:37:41,143
[SPEAKER_05]: Tomorrow is the meeting.

472
00:37:41,163 --> 00:37:41,243
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

473
00:37:45,580 --> 00:38:02,028
[SPEAKER_05]: So we were just waiting for the CPC had asked if we could take down the amount of the project to see if the DPW could take on some of the tree work so that they could give some of the funds that we were asking for to.

474
00:38:03,369 --> 00:38:08,192
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know another specific project or just in general to have a little bit more left in the pot.

475
00:38:08,913 --> 00:38:13,056
[SPEAKER_05]: The DPW came back and said they do not have the money in their budget to take on the tree work.

476
00:38:13,876 --> 00:38:19,660
[SPEAKER_05]: So therefore, we are back to asking for the full amount of the project that it was.

477
00:38:20,601 --> 00:38:22,643
[SPEAKER_05]: So are they voting tomorrow night?

478
00:38:23,403 --> 00:38:24,664
[SPEAKER_05]: or is it?

479
00:38:24,724 --> 00:38:26,465
[SPEAKER_04]: Doug's vote was very clear.

480
00:38:26,966 --> 00:38:30,368
[SPEAKER_04]: It was conditional that they took it down to 200,000.

481
00:38:30,568 --> 00:38:39,114
[SPEAKER_04]: But if they didn't have money for the tree work and DPW declined to do the tree work, that he advocated approving the application in full.

482
00:38:39,394 --> 00:38:42,296
[SPEAKER_04]: So they kept that money in reserve.

483
00:38:42,396 --> 00:38:45,979
[SPEAKER_04]: So ideally, they should have the whole amount just sitting there waiting for us.

484
00:38:46,039 --> 00:38:47,700
[SPEAKER_04]: And all they've got to do is prove the whole thing.

485
00:38:48,638 --> 00:38:51,440
[SPEAKER_05]: So CPC is approving it or the city council's approving it?

486
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:56,643
[SPEAKER_04]: CPC has to approve it first, then it'll generate a money paper and go to city council and the city council will approve it.

487
00:38:57,203 --> 00:39:00,826
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so it's the CPC approval tomorrow night that we're waiting for.

488
00:39:01,246 --> 00:39:01,426
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

489
00:39:01,906 --> 00:39:06,229
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, and then- Ideally we can be on the next city council agenda provided we make the deadline.

490
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:10,612
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, because we wanna start getting that RFP out.

491
00:39:10,712 --> 00:39:12,073
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's already April.

492
00:39:14,711 --> 00:39:22,140
[SPEAKER_05]: So hopefully, so fingers crossed everybody that that just gets finalized tomorrow night and then we'll be on our merry way with phase two of the park work.

493
00:39:25,784 --> 00:39:26,084
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

494
00:39:27,414 --> 00:39:33,056
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, this might, oh, and Ryan, anything on survey project, product, product, projects, project, products?

495
00:39:33,696 --> 00:39:43,640
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the consultant plans to wrap up by May, I believe, for Fulton Heights, so next round of product, phased product is coming.

496
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:48,201
[SPEAKER_05]: Great, okay.

497
00:39:48,601 --> 00:39:56,504
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm shocked that our meeting has gone by this fast, but does anybody have anything else before we approve the minutes from last month?

498
00:39:58,251 --> 00:39:59,972
[SPEAKER_04]: How's things going with the Brooks Estate?

499
00:40:01,693 --> 00:40:03,415
[SPEAKER_05]: Things are going well, actually.

500
00:40:03,515 --> 00:40:09,819
[SPEAKER_05]: We met with, we had a second interview for a new president over there.

501
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:17,264
[SPEAKER_05]: And it looks, I mean, I think me, Doug and Zach are all on board to bring her on.

502
00:40:17,304 --> 00:40:22,267
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, we have to have a full board approval and then we can put it before the,

503
00:40:23,588 --> 00:40:25,610
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, voting membership for the nonprofit.

504
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:39,941
[SPEAKER_05]: So that, uh, our hope is to get the board on the board on board this month, and then we'll have to arrange for any, like, a pseudo, you know, kind of interim annual meeting to have a formal vote.

505
00:40:41,242 --> 00:40:43,483
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but the goal is to get that going.

506
00:40:43,624 --> 00:40:51,790
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to have to give, I think, a 30-day notice for the meeting, um, so we can get that posted before the end of this month, and we can have it next month.

507
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:55,051
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, so things are good.

508
00:40:58,534 --> 00:40:58,815
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

509
00:40:59,796 --> 00:41:02,318
[SPEAKER_04]: I was, let's see, old business.

510
00:41:02,398 --> 00:41:19,073
[SPEAKER_04]: I was asked by Teresa to help with the interpretive panels around Riverbend Park over by the new, well, the formerly new schools, but we'll just call them the new schools, because that's what everybody calls them.

511
00:41:19,933 --> 00:41:20,914
[SPEAKER_04]: The McGlynn and the Andrews.

512
00:41:21,214 --> 00:41:23,075
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we're working on that.

513
00:41:23,556 --> 00:41:25,737
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we want to change the text up a little bit.

514
00:41:25,757 --> 00:41:27,238
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be great to have some help on that.

515
00:41:27,258 --> 00:41:28,619
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to pare down the text.

516
00:41:28,639 --> 00:41:32,222
[SPEAKER_04]: We want more images to pare down the text because they're very text heavy.

517
00:41:35,151 --> 00:41:50,203
[SPEAKER_04]: I think with just a simple change up of text that focuses on maybe some of the shipyard workers, their houses, and some of the builders themselves, and some maps and things like that, that we can just get much nicer information on them this time.

518
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:53,185
[SPEAKER_05]: How many panels are over in that park?

519
00:41:53,926 --> 00:41:57,369
[SPEAKER_04]: There's five, three of them are environmental, two of them are history.

520
00:41:57,789 --> 00:42:02,493
[SPEAKER_04]: So the environmental ones are in Alicia's hands and the history ones are in our hands.

521
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:09,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, so we're also working on trying to come up with like a standard.

522
00:42:10,598 --> 00:42:17,045
[SPEAKER_04]: We talked about this for Thomas Brooks Park and standard city sign so that we can have the same interpretive panels no matter where they go.

523
00:42:17,105 --> 00:42:19,468
[SPEAKER_04]: None of this changing up for different panels.

524
00:42:19,508 --> 00:42:22,612
[SPEAKER_04]: We want the same consistent look and feel throughout the entire city.

525
00:42:23,167 --> 00:42:23,988
[SPEAKER_04]: of all the temples.

526
00:42:24,629 --> 00:42:24,929
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

527
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:25,550
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

528
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:28,354
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's a great idea because they are like a mishmash.

529
00:42:28,614 --> 00:42:34,541
[SPEAKER_05]: There's one in the Brooks Estate too, like over by the pond that you will be redoing that one too.

530
00:42:34,621 --> 00:42:38,667
[SPEAKER_05]: I think having a consistent look would make a huge difference.

531
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:41,021
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I chose not to reinvent the wheel.

532
00:42:41,081 --> 00:42:47,403
[SPEAKER_04]: I simply recommended that we follow the National Parks interpretive panels, which they come in basically four different sizes.

533
00:42:47,443 --> 00:42:52,765
[SPEAKER_04]: They come in a small size, like it's what's at the Brooks Estate, come in a slightly bigger size, like what's on Clippership Park.

534
00:42:53,885 --> 00:43:04,649
[SPEAKER_04]: That's that lowish panel, and then they come with some much larger things that I don't think we would typically use in this time period, because we don't have large sweeping vistas like they do, so.

535
00:43:07,865 --> 00:43:13,060
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's that that's working Andrew school also mentioned I was I mentioned to Teresa that.

536
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:19,118
[SPEAKER_04]: it was a little bit sad to see the course of the Mystic River gone out of the McGlynn playground.

537
00:43:19,178 --> 00:43:23,800
[SPEAKER_04]: And lo and behold, I got an email from the folks who are designing that saying, oh, we missed this.

538
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:26,120
[SPEAKER_04]: We wanted to include this in our panel somewhere.

539
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:33,322
[SPEAKER_04]: So I pointed them to the 1855 map because their playground is actually a point, an important point in the Mystic River.

540
00:43:33,342 --> 00:43:40,224
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a bend called Labor and Vain that was one of the first sticking points for navigation in the Mystic River.

541
00:43:40,344 --> 00:43:42,685
[SPEAKER_04]: So in the 18th century, they cut a canal to,

542
00:43:43,505 --> 00:43:48,331
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, change the channel basically, and that's one of the first of many improvements to the Mystic River.

543
00:43:48,412 --> 00:43:49,553
[SPEAKER_04]: They wanted to highlight that.

544
00:43:49,633 --> 00:43:53,398
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're keeping that information on their interpretive panel as well.

545
00:43:53,518 --> 00:44:00,267
[SPEAKER_04]: So another opportunity to add history to the students information there.

546
00:44:01,515 --> 00:44:03,476
[SPEAKER_04]: Trying to think if there was anything else, but I don't think so.

547
00:44:03,516 --> 00:44:05,296
[SPEAKER_04]: That's keeping us pretty busy now.

548
00:44:05,336 --> 00:44:14,199
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there like, do you want to can you put the existing panels in a Google drive and send the link around and we can all look at it and.

549
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:18,081
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe an example of a national park 1 and then.

550
00:44:19,531 --> 00:44:21,372
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and I mean, we have the ones that we've worked on.

551
00:44:21,412 --> 00:44:26,376
[SPEAKER_04]: We did the Wellington panel that had some just reduced information down.

552
00:44:26,416 --> 00:44:31,219
[SPEAKER_04]: We did the one on Salem, the Riverside Plaza that kind of points people to different locations.

553
00:44:31,239 --> 00:44:35,863
[SPEAKER_04]: The goal was to tie other locations into the area that they're standing in.

554
00:44:35,883 --> 00:44:40,486
[SPEAKER_04]: So people are encouraged to not just investigate the history there, but also the history of other sites.

555
00:44:42,488 --> 00:44:45,370
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any role to include the Historical Society in this?

556
00:44:47,842 --> 00:44:58,164
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I think this is such a small project that I think they'll come into play when we deal with images, but I think that they have a lot of them in our files.

557
00:44:58,184 --> 00:45:01,285
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a matter of getting the originals from them.

558
00:45:03,465 --> 00:45:15,188
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of pictures of actual shipbuilding towards the end of the 19th century, which I think is far more fascinating than some maps of the Mystic River that don't really show much information.

559
00:45:18,873 --> 00:45:20,715
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think that's a good point, Kit.

560
00:45:20,915 --> 00:45:31,284
[SPEAKER_05]: They might want to, Theresa might want to reach out to them or just like, hey, heads up, we're working on this and our goal is to make them all templated across the city moving forward.

561
00:45:31,304 --> 00:45:32,164
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

562
00:45:36,007 --> 00:45:36,508
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, good.

563
00:45:36,868 --> 00:45:41,812
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but Ryan, send those around and we can look at them and provide feedback.

564
00:45:43,294 --> 00:45:43,434
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
