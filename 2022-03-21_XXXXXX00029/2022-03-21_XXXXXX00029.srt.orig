00:00:34,065 --> 00:00:35,787
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for meeting with me today.

8
00:00:36,127 --> 00:00:40,010
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't mind just introducing yourself with your name and pronouns and just a bit about yourself.

9
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:41,900
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

10
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:43,441
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, I'm Jim Silva.

11
00:00:44,301 --> 00:00:45,502
[SPEAKER_01]: My pronoun is he, him.

12
00:00:46,182 --> 00:00:47,343
[SPEAKER_01]: I live in South Medford.

13
00:00:47,723 --> 00:00:51,144
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a resident for the last 18 years of South Medford.

14
00:00:52,405 --> 00:00:57,747
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew up there and left in the late seventies and went and searched the world.

15
00:00:58,427 --> 00:01:03,049
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was, lived in the city of Boston for a long time, lived in New York city as well.

16
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:08,432
[SPEAKER_01]: And I came back to Medford, purchased my folks home in South Medford back in 2004.

17
00:01:08,472 --> 00:01:08,532
[SPEAKER_01]: And

18
00:01:12,368 --> 00:01:15,273
[SPEAKER_01]: started really involving myself in community.

19
00:01:16,955 --> 00:01:24,667
[SPEAKER_01]: I started the South Medford residents together organization because we had a mothball school in South Medford, two of them actually the Lincoln Kennedy.

20
00:01:25,762 --> 00:01:31,824
[SPEAKER_01]: And the concern was some of the zoning aspects, it was ambiguous we didn't know what was going to be there so we collaborated.

21
00:01:32,584 --> 00:01:41,287
[SPEAKER_01]: And from there, it's sort of parlayed into the need to advocate for city services, and ultimately other things started to arrive with that.

22
00:01:43,048 --> 00:01:52,993
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a pretty interesting journey, one that I never thought I would be on, but it's really amazing when you immerse yourself in community, what you find and what you learn.

23
00:01:53,793 --> 00:01:57,995
[SPEAKER_01]: And the fabric in South Medford is so varied and so wonderful.

24
00:01:58,896 --> 00:02:03,098
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really been a great experience and continues to be.

25
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:07,380
[SPEAKER_01]: I was one of the founding members of Safe Medford.

26
00:02:08,521 --> 00:02:14,907
[SPEAKER_01]: in 2017, paused for Medford in 2016 to get our first dog park built in Medford.

27
00:02:16,248 --> 00:02:18,230
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a need for equity.

28
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:23,215
[SPEAKER_01]: We all have our children, and some of us have those children that need to have their own playgrounds.

29
00:02:23,315 --> 00:02:27,198
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was really a wonderful experience as well.

30
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:29,901
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been part of Charter Review since 2013.

31
00:02:32,403 --> 00:02:42,129
[SPEAKER_01]: I have gone through this for a number of years and really this value in educating folks about review and what review means.

32
00:02:42,769 --> 00:02:53,275
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't necessarily mean a change of legislation or the way that we do our business, but oftentimes it amends or improves upon something so that's really

33
00:02:54,135 --> 00:02:59,759
[SPEAKER_01]: really sort of what I feel I've helped to advocate, but also to educate people.

34
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:05,164
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, every city has a right to review, so people need to realize that.

35
00:03:06,785 --> 00:03:09,647
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've been on the GLX, the Green Line Extension, since 2017.

36
00:03:10,608 --> 00:03:20,956
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a co-chair of parking policy and enforcement for Mayor Longo Curran, and I'm a former member of Arts Collaborative.

37
00:03:22,998 --> 00:03:30,146
[SPEAKER_01]: part of the group who was advocating for Medford's first art center, which is coming together here on Mystic Avenue in South Medford.

38
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:34,531
[SPEAKER_01]: Just recently, the news has been put out, I think you met with Laurel Siebel.

39
00:03:38,055 --> 00:03:38,335
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.

40
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:51,711
[SPEAKER_00]: Well Jim I know you were a lot of hats and I appreciate your reflection on what it feels like to be immersed in the community and that's definitely something I'm experiencing by talking to so many folks within Medford and your name certainly comes up a lot.

41
00:03:52,392 --> 00:03:56,296
[SPEAKER_00]: So, hopefully we'll flush out some of those things that you brought up some of the different

42
00:03:57,898 --> 00:04:01,142
[SPEAKER_00]: different places where you have your paws.

43
00:04:02,503 --> 00:04:11,153
[SPEAKER_00]: I always try to start out each episode with a question about food, so if you don't mind sharing what your favorite place to eat is in Medford and what you like to eat there.

44
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:22,543
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there is carols, and I love the oysters, and I love the South Medford drink, which is just amazing.

45
00:04:23,544 --> 00:04:29,889
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something I collaborated with, and so you have to go, you have to have the oysters, and you have to try the South Medford drink.

46
00:04:30,189 --> 00:04:31,510
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the South Medford drink?

47
00:04:32,311 --> 00:04:33,792
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't tell you, it's a secret.

48
00:04:35,773 --> 00:04:38,195
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but really it just works well.

49
00:04:38,836 --> 00:04:42,179
[SPEAKER_01]: And it allows us to celebrate South Memphis.

50
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,521
[SPEAKER_01]: I love Semolina Kitchen.

51
00:04:45,282 --> 00:04:46,523
[SPEAKER_01]: I spend a lot of time there.

52
00:04:46,543 --> 00:04:49,706
[SPEAKER_01]: I love Tasty on the Hill for breakfast.

53
00:04:50,987 --> 00:04:53,509
[SPEAKER_01]: I love Oasis down the end of my street.

54
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:58,413
[SPEAKER_01]: When I feel like I need to have a meat fix, it's really helpful.

55
00:04:59,294 --> 00:05:00,175
[SPEAKER_01]: Colette's Bakery.

56
00:05:02,806 --> 00:05:03,046
[SPEAKER_01]: another.

57
00:05:03,146 --> 00:05:08,288
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to avoid that a lot unless I walk backwards really quickly to kind of burn off some of that.

58
00:05:08,428 --> 00:05:10,408
[SPEAKER_01]: But so I have a lot of places.

59
00:05:10,468 --> 00:05:11,949
[SPEAKER_01]: Love Snappy Patties.

60
00:05:12,709 --> 00:05:14,009
[SPEAKER_01]: I love Bistro 5.

61
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:16,450
[SPEAKER_01]: But those are my favorites.

62
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:17,410
[SPEAKER_01]: I eat a lot.

63
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:18,271
[SPEAKER_01]: I go out a lot.

64
00:05:18,711 --> 00:05:23,032
[SPEAKER_01]: I spend a lot of time, you know, at the Danish pastry.

65
00:05:23,052 --> 00:05:24,313
[SPEAKER_01]: They have great coffee.

66
00:05:25,313 --> 00:05:28,134
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly once in a while I do partake in the pastry.

67
00:05:29,554 --> 00:05:30,194
[SPEAKER_01]: Quite a few places.

68
00:05:30,935 --> 00:05:31,855
[SPEAKER_00]: Hard to choose, yeah.

69
00:05:32,655 --> 00:05:34,516
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think restaurant week is coming up.

70
00:05:34,576 --> 00:05:35,777
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this next week?

71
00:05:36,017 --> 00:05:37,978
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually had Shop the Squares.

72
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:41,280
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also, I'm sorry, I'm on the Chamber of Commerce.

73
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:52,386
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm on the Board of Directors and we had Shop the Squares in February and it was where people would go and go to restaurants and some of the other locations actually.

74
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:54,727
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really a great way to

75
00:05:55,431 --> 00:05:59,793
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of bring people out as we were kind of winding down from the pandemic.

76
00:06:00,033 --> 00:06:02,715
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it was good.

77
00:06:02,755 --> 00:06:04,296
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a very successful program.

78
00:06:04,436 --> 00:06:13,180
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just going to build on it every year, small time of year, but it's really wonderful when people can get out and explore and discover some other places.

79
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,641
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're discovering it too.

80
00:06:14,701 --> 00:06:18,783
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just opens up, you know, places that we would never imagine.

81
00:06:19,357 --> 00:06:24,864
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you're hoping to win those Jonathan Van Ness tickets for sure.

82
00:06:25,504 --> 00:06:26,225
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, awesome.

83
00:06:26,325 --> 00:06:27,006
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was fun.

84
00:06:27,046 --> 00:06:29,189
[SPEAKER_00]: That was actually really fun to participate in.

85
00:06:29,549 --> 00:06:31,872
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we found out about it kind of late in the month.

86
00:06:31,912 --> 00:06:34,936
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we were like, oh, these are all places that we would normally go to.

87
00:06:34,996 --> 00:06:37,479
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, great.

88
00:06:38,059 --> 00:06:38,320
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.

89
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:39,701
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.

90
00:06:39,741 --> 00:06:44,003
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know there's a couple of sort of like timely things we could talk about.

91
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:48,425
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Green Line extension and I know the parking changes are happening.

92
00:06:48,985 --> 00:06:51,246
[SPEAKER_00]: So is there one that you'd like to talk about first?

93
00:06:51,787 --> 00:06:53,147
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they are kind of together.

94
00:06:53,848 --> 00:06:57,069
[SPEAKER_01]: GLX Green Line extension was

95
00:06:59,313 --> 00:07:07,702
[SPEAKER_01]: This ruling that was done in 2007, the state agreed upon, the Conservation Law Foundation had filed suit, big dig, great mitigation.

96
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:11,466
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Green Line was part of that mitigation, part of that agreement.

97
00:07:12,287 --> 00:07:15,110
[SPEAKER_01]: Ultimately, it was a plan to go to Route 16.

98
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:18,153
[SPEAKER_01]: We're hopeful it will continue on the phase two part of that.

99
00:07:18,613 --> 00:07:30,421
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's currently seven new stations from Lechmere, which is a renewed Lechmere across the street, up to Medford Tufts, and also a spur to Union Square, which is opening this Monday.

100
00:07:31,102 --> 00:07:37,826
[SPEAKER_01]: So after all of this time and our monthly meetings, we've been able to actually

101
00:07:39,047 --> 00:07:44,855
[SPEAKER_01]: see something on Monday to get on this train to be able to ride and the convenience factor is so important.

102
00:07:45,436 --> 00:07:53,487
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many people in the city of Medford 20 more than 25% of our community takes public transportation or wash your bikes.

103
00:07:54,087 --> 00:07:55,287
[SPEAKER_01]: And equity is important.

104
00:07:56,328 --> 00:08:02,589
[SPEAKER_01]: Quality of air, quality of life with traffic, the convenience factor.

105
00:08:02,609 --> 00:08:04,209
[SPEAKER_01]: A commute should not take you forever.

106
00:08:04,389 --> 00:08:06,970
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm someone who rides the green line.

107
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:08,030
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm someone who rides.

108
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:11,271
[SPEAKER_01]: I have clients in my own business.

109
00:08:11,351 --> 00:08:14,832
[SPEAKER_01]: I do technology support and development and a lot of clients here in the city.

110
00:08:15,212 --> 00:08:17,533
[SPEAKER_01]: I took the bus and the orange line this morning.

111
00:08:17,593 --> 00:08:19,373
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm always on public transportation.

112
00:08:19,453 --> 00:08:21,954
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it is such an important balance.

113
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:23,654
[SPEAKER_01]: It provides people with an option.

114
00:08:25,035 --> 00:08:32,781
[SPEAKER_01]: So my role in this, I split my time at the Ball Square Station with my Somerville counterpart, Jennifer Dawson.

115
00:08:33,501 --> 00:08:40,607
[SPEAKER_01]: We've worked to ensure that people in the community were notified when there was closures, specifically the Broadway Bridge.

116
00:08:41,007 --> 00:08:42,228
[SPEAKER_01]: We worked with the businesses.

117
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:45,551
[SPEAKER_01]: We tried to advocate for the businesses throughout both communities.

118
00:08:46,612 --> 00:08:51,936
[SPEAKER_01]: And an interesting part about the Ball Square Station is 95% of the station sits in the city of Medford.

119
00:08:52,556 --> 00:08:59,438
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're also working on trying to actually have a sign that says South Medford under the Ball Square if you're familiar with Davis Square.

120
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:09,520
[SPEAKER_01]: It has Tufts University and they make an announcement when you come into the station, because it's important both communities share that load and share that responsibility so we want to share that name.

121
00:09:10,321 --> 00:09:15,102
[SPEAKER_01]: It won't be on a map, but ultimately we're hopeful again, it will be announced as you come into the station.

122
00:09:16,402 --> 00:09:28,051
[SPEAKER_01]: Interestingly enough, three of the stations are identified as Medford station to sit in the city of Medford, but Magoon Square for the lower Main Street is really a walk to station.

123
00:09:28,431 --> 00:09:41,361
[SPEAKER_01]: So we look at this when we're doing wayfinding and working with Walk Medford to sort of identify that so people understand what the walking sort of locations are and pointing people into that direction.

124
00:09:42,101 --> 00:10:08,827
[SPEAKER_01]: as somebody who works in the Chamber of Commerce, I think it's important for businesses to be part of this process because it opens up their possibility to a whole new group of people who are from Somerville who might transport to say to go to Collette's Bakery or to go and visit Oasis if they're having their meat moment and you know so this is great sort of process and it was an opportunity as me as a liaison to work with community people to advocate for

125
00:10:09,287 --> 00:10:16,453
[SPEAKER_01]: the construction noise to mitigate any kind of problems that would possibly happen from construction.

126
00:10:17,154 --> 00:10:25,241
[SPEAKER_01]: This project was interesting because it was not only building a green light or a rapid transit, it was actually rebuilding a commuter rail.

127
00:10:25,301 --> 00:10:28,544
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was two systems built simultaneously.

128
00:10:29,124 --> 00:10:31,246
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we always said in our meetings, you know,

129
00:10:32,147 --> 00:10:40,929
[SPEAKER_01]: The GLXC people, the contractors, they have never built in an urban area like this, the density, the noise, those kind of things.

130
00:10:40,969 --> 00:10:46,291
[SPEAKER_01]: So we learn together on what could work and what doesn't, and we tweak things accordingly.

131
00:10:46,891 --> 00:10:54,553
[SPEAKER_01]: And every month we meet, it's open to the public, and we're continuing to do this until the Medford Tufts station opens.

132
00:10:55,293 --> 00:10:57,494
[SPEAKER_01]: in late August of this year.

133
00:10:58,495 --> 00:11:06,840
[SPEAKER_01]: But we also then meet with the Mayor of Medford, we met with Mayor Burke before Mayor Lungo-Curran, and we talk about and discuss issues.

134
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:18,767
[SPEAKER_01]: We talk about issues that are related to pedestrian egress, safety, all of those things, traffic mitigation, to things such as where is the Uber and Lyft

135
00:11:19,347 --> 00:11:21,809
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, space is going to be in relation to the station.

136
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:29,216
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, from the beginning in 2007, when this was approved to 2022, the world has changed.

137
00:11:29,296 --> 00:11:31,838
[SPEAKER_01]: The way that people do that last mile is different.

138
00:11:31,878 --> 00:11:34,821
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't have what ride sharing in 2007.

139
00:11:35,301 --> 00:11:36,862
[SPEAKER_01]: So now that's something that needs to be.

140
00:11:36,943 --> 00:11:40,386
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's been an ongoing dynamic process.

141
00:11:41,827 --> 00:11:45,410
[SPEAKER_01]: It's again, it's been a great way to keep people informed.

142
00:11:46,146 --> 00:11:56,268
[SPEAKER_01]: but also opening people's eyes to the possibility of issues with affordability and so housing issues and things that will change.

143
00:11:56,588 --> 00:12:06,911
[SPEAKER_01]: These projects are built for people who depend on public transportation, but oftentimes people are tossed to the side because it becomes an affordability issue.

144
00:12:07,071 --> 00:12:12,052
[SPEAKER_01]: So that has been on our mind as well and part of our process.

145
00:12:13,272 --> 00:12:16,475
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you say again where the stops for the Green Line will be in Medford?

146
00:12:17,115 --> 00:12:17,375
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

147
00:12:17,655 --> 00:12:20,097
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'd be Medford Tufts, which is right at College Avenue.

148
00:12:20,137 --> 00:12:30,604
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you go by the new Cummings building, if you're coming up College Avenue to Boston Ave, it's right on your right-hand side as you're coming up College Ave.

149
00:12:30,784 --> 00:12:38,730
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're coming from Boston Ave up from Harvard Street, it's straight ahead as you pass towards the Hillside Shopping District.

150
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:39,610
[SPEAKER_01]: It's on your right.

151
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:55,108
[SPEAKER_01]: All square station is off of Boston Avenue is an egress from the ground level from Boston now, and there's one from the Broadway bridge which will bring you to a lobby, which will have stairs to go down to the station.

152
00:12:55,768 --> 00:13:08,357
[SPEAKER_01]: and also elevator down because most stations have two elevators in case one is out for people with mobility issues, but because Ball Square is at grade one of the entrances, we only have one elevator.

153
00:13:08,377 --> 00:13:12,560
[SPEAKER_01]: We have some beautiful art on the elevators themselves.

154
00:13:14,661 --> 00:13:18,624
[SPEAKER_01]: We have stained glass and it's just beautifully done.

155
00:13:19,144 --> 00:13:36,520
[SPEAKER_01]: We have an opportunity, there's a substation there, a DC Power substation, and we're looking, the City of Medford, collaborating with the City of Somerville to do a community canvas, the possibility of doing some type of muraling or something of that nature, and it's really early on.

156
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:43,126
[SPEAKER_01]: The way the T handles this is usually they wait for the station to be working for about a year,

157
00:13:43,927 --> 00:13:46,349
[SPEAKER_01]: up and running, and then they sort of go the next step.

158
00:13:46,809 --> 00:13:53,934
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a huge parcel in front of the station on Boston Avenue that is going to be a transit-oriented development.

159
00:13:54,255 --> 00:14:01,260
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know what that looks like, and as I said, the T generally waits until things are up and running and what needs to be tweaked.

160
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:02,722
[SPEAKER_01]: and what etc.

161
00:14:02,862 --> 00:14:16,561
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's just how they do it and we have more information if you if you email me at jfsilva at smrto.org I can point you to these different locations about

162
00:14:17,462 --> 00:14:29,978
[SPEAKER_01]: real estate and how the team kind of works with people in developing and what the criteria for development is and who's the market segment that they are really interested in working with.

163
00:14:29,998 --> 00:14:34,744
[SPEAKER_01]: So, they're very thoughtful in their approach, and, but it would really be helpful for people.

164
00:14:36,272 --> 00:15:00,950
[SPEAKER_01]: there's also some issues along the corridor that we're putting on to the city website because of the light rail vehicles are overhead with with electric propulsion there's a concern if there's any construction within 30 feet of the right away, you have to get a special permit, so the city of medford will have that as part of their.

165
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:10,880
[SPEAKER_01]: criteria for any work along there, but these are the things that we've been able to take to community to tell folks along the corridor that this is something they need to be aware of.

166
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:16,485
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're learning as we go along, but these are an important part of a working group as a liaison.

167
00:15:16,926 --> 00:15:17,446
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

168
00:15:17,466 --> 00:15:20,149
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you most excited about for the Green Line coming up next?

169
00:15:21,863 --> 00:15:25,005
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I do love the one-on-one it's, you know, it's beautiful.

170
00:15:25,045 --> 00:15:32,429
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like being in Ikea with the blue and yellow of the interior of the bus, but I prefer to just.

171
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:37,773
[SPEAKER_01]: So from my perspective, it's, it, it's a convenience factor.

172
00:15:37,893 --> 00:15:44,737
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a cluster of, of at least me a station at what point there are a number of, uh, condo buildings.

173
00:15:45,337 --> 00:15:48,619
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the IT person for the management of those buildings.

174
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:58,763
[SPEAKER_01]: So I being on this committee, I've been able to help them navigate through that and keep people on the green line of aware about those folks in those communities.

175
00:15:58,823 --> 00:16:06,666
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll be able to get off there and get off at Science Park slash West End, similar to Ball Square slash South Medford.

176
00:16:07,406 --> 00:16:10,147
[SPEAKER_01]: but have folks in there and North Station.

177
00:16:10,207 --> 00:16:13,889
[SPEAKER_01]: So along the line, it will be, for me personally, wonderful.

178
00:16:13,929 --> 00:16:16,471
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also think we are having the E-train.

179
00:16:16,731 --> 00:16:21,633
[SPEAKER_01]: And when the E-train ends at Heath Street, it will allow us to go to the Museum of Fine Arts.

180
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:24,074
[SPEAKER_01]: We just get on a train, get off a train.

181
00:16:25,355 --> 00:16:29,680
[SPEAKER_01]: My accent comes back every once in a while.

182
00:16:30,461 --> 00:16:31,282
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Willow.

183
00:16:31,823 --> 00:16:32,383
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

184
00:16:33,044 --> 00:16:40,953
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I always like, I work in Central Square in Cambridge and the commute to get there is, it was like riding my bike to the Orange Line.

185
00:16:41,514 --> 00:16:43,817
[SPEAKER_00]: It would take me, it would add so much time to my commute.

186
00:16:43,857 --> 00:16:45,679
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is exciting to hear about, yeah.

187
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:51,581
[SPEAKER_01]: Interestingly, my house is point seven miles from Davis Square subway station I live in Medford.

188
00:16:52,121 --> 00:16:57,363
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, every morning there's numerous people that walk by my house that are going to the subway.

189
00:16:58,043 --> 00:17:05,245
[SPEAKER_01]: My friends live up on Broadway near Trump Field, and I'm actually closer to Davis Square than they are and there's some of the restaurant residents so

190
00:17:05,825 --> 00:17:13,290
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting how commuting is, but the Red Line has been an amazing difference in Davis Square.

191
00:17:14,071 --> 00:17:18,634
[SPEAKER_01]: From when I was a teenager, which you would never go there, to someplace that you want to go to.

192
00:17:19,334 --> 00:17:21,035
[SPEAKER_01]: Transportation makes that difference.

193
00:17:21,696 --> 00:17:22,416
[SPEAKER_01]: It changes.

194
00:17:22,436 --> 00:17:25,979
[SPEAKER_01]: It gives people a streetscape that it didn't have before.

195
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:31,082
[SPEAKER_00]: Any concerns or anything that's giving people pause about the Green Line coming to Metro?

196
00:17:32,622 --> 00:17:40,167
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the uncertainty of the noise, I think that people feel that there might be some noise issues.

197
00:17:40,767 --> 00:17:50,893
[SPEAKER_01]: What we had recommended and we actually advocated for the community liaison group is sort of a post-monitoring of the noise, certainly in areas.

198
00:17:50,973 --> 00:17:55,896
[SPEAKER_01]: If you know where Semolina is on Boston Avenue, there used to be a building there that Tufts took down.

199
00:17:56,677 --> 00:17:58,958
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now it's an open sort of area.

200
00:17:59,238 --> 00:17:59,399
[SPEAKER_01]: St.

201
00:17:59,439 --> 00:18:00,639
[SPEAKER_01]: Clements Road is Medford.

202
00:18:02,335 --> 00:18:08,597
[SPEAKER_01]: Tufts installed noise proofing in the first six homes on St.

203
00:18:08,617 --> 00:18:10,658
[SPEAKER_01]: Clements Road, but the echoing of that.

204
00:18:10,738 --> 00:18:20,501
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that said, we want to make sure that there is some noise monitoring that happens post to alleviate.

205
00:18:20,621 --> 00:18:23,662
[SPEAKER_01]: So that way we want to continue this relationship.

206
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:24,622
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to make sure that

207
00:18:25,302 --> 00:18:27,724
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, folks are well taken care of.

208
00:18:27,904 --> 00:18:32,768
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's an issue, we need to have that open communication to make sure we can make some changes.

209
00:18:33,128 --> 00:18:37,072
[SPEAKER_01]: There'll be vegetation that's going to be planted along there that supposedly will absorb it.

210
00:18:37,092 --> 00:18:38,313
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a light rail.

211
00:18:38,613 --> 00:18:40,895
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like the red line, the orange line, the blue line.

212
00:18:40,975 --> 00:18:41,715
[SPEAKER_01]: It's light rails.

213
00:18:41,956 --> 00:18:44,518
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not as noisy.

214
00:18:44,638 --> 00:18:51,483
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not as heavy, which is probably going to be a little bit different as far as the noise is concerned.

215
00:18:52,856 --> 00:18:55,739
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have been advocating to keep the 80 bus.

216
00:18:55,999 --> 00:19:05,466
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the 80 bus runs parallel, it comes from Lechmia to Arlington Center, and it runs through Somerville, Pearl Street, Bedford Street, Broadway, and then Boston Avenue.

217
00:19:06,167 --> 00:19:13,393
[SPEAKER_01]: We have many folks who depend on that, folks who live on North Street, children that go to Arlington Catholic High School.

218
00:19:14,473 --> 00:19:37,685
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to keep that bus and there has been sort of this idea that with the Green Line, you know, we're going to potentially take that away so the city of Medford from our liaison, working with the Green Line has been advocating to keep that and explaining the importance and advocating for the importance of people on North Street, people in West Medford, people in Arlington that come to our city, and also for people to show up.

219
00:19:40,046 --> 00:19:40,647
[SPEAKER_00]: It's exciting.

220
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:40,888
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

221
00:19:40,968 --> 00:19:44,575
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's the connection with Parky?

222
00:19:44,595 --> 00:19:50,767
[SPEAKER_01]: So, as I said, early on, part of the South Methodist Together organization was to

223
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:54,130
[SPEAKER_01]: get a resident parking program.

224
00:19:54,150 --> 00:20:02,913
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a lot of people, as I said, my proximity to my house to Davis Square Station, people would park their car and walk to Davis, creates a problem.

225
00:20:03,513 --> 00:20:12,695
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a community of students, which allow it to be vibrant, but also creates a lot of parking problems, potentially.

226
00:20:13,735 --> 00:20:21,965
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I have worked with folks in the community and if you go to the smarter website SMR to.org.

227
00:20:22,586 --> 00:20:32,198
[SPEAKER_01]: It gives you the procedure on how to get resident parking you can download a petition, you can do this process so I've worked with a number of ministrations and counselors over the years.

228
00:20:33,078 --> 00:20:37,741
[SPEAKER_01]: and been part of sort of looking at this parking program.

229
00:20:37,781 --> 00:20:48,386
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a little dysfunctional, it's a little interesting, and it needs to be tweaked a bit because of the potential GLX coming in.

230
00:20:48,726 --> 00:20:53,469
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some streets, main streets, for instance, currently you can't get resident parking.

231
00:20:54,429 --> 00:20:58,952
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have street sweeping and all the streets around you have resident parking,

232
00:20:59,972 --> 00:21:08,023
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't park your car on there because also the dysfunction of the current system is you have to be a resident that street to park on that street.

233
00:21:08,805 --> 00:21:15,574
[SPEAKER_01]: So, it doesn't work for everyone equally you have people who live on small streets like Burke Road, where there are.

234
00:21:16,235 --> 00:21:22,439
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there are 20 spaces, but there are 47 resident parking in visitors.

235
00:21:22,519 --> 00:21:24,300
[SPEAKER_01]: So it needs to be looked at.

236
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:40,431
[SPEAKER_01]: And we pointed out in our report, we produced a 60 page report on parking policy enforcement, which we gave to the mayor a year ago this month and made those recommendations and actually had statistics about population and talked about

237
00:21:41,211 --> 00:21:48,621
[SPEAKER_01]: You know specific streets we identified 17 streets that had some real problems and inequities that needed to be addressed.

238
00:21:49,982 --> 00:21:58,833
[SPEAKER_01]: And, but also there is, you know, a growing population of folks who were were older who needs services who needs to have a visiting nurse so there needs to be specific.

239
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:07,101
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of parking needs for movers, for people who just arrived that haven't had their car, for a new car, for a rental car.

240
00:22:07,681 --> 00:22:09,403
[SPEAKER_01]: The product needs to be tweaked.

241
00:22:09,903 --> 00:22:15,228
[SPEAKER_01]: So we wanted to tweak this in a way that we could get feedback.

242
00:22:15,328 --> 00:22:22,094
[SPEAKER_01]: We had over almost a thousand people respond to our survey, and we talked about what they'd like to see.

243
00:22:22,614 --> 00:22:33,717
[SPEAKER_01]: So the main charge of the parking areas were the GLX area, South Medford and the Hillside area, because they're most impacted from the change of public transportation.

244
00:22:35,778 --> 00:22:40,299
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, for instance, our private ways, a private way is a private way.

245
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:44,201
[SPEAKER_01]: You cannot post a resident parking, the city can't ticket on those streets.

246
00:22:44,621 --> 00:22:47,662
[SPEAKER_01]: So 34 streets in those areas, that charge area,

247
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:50,468
[SPEAKER_01]: that are sort of left on their own.

248
00:22:50,628 --> 00:22:59,311
[SPEAKER_01]: So the city's responsibility really needs to step up and have policy and to help people manage this potential change.

249
00:22:59,631 --> 00:23:05,893
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really what Milonga Curran looked at when she had the charge, the GLX was the area that was looked at.

250
00:23:06,933 --> 00:23:09,994
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Medford, we started off with Medford's a tale of two cities.

251
00:23:10,414 --> 00:23:16,035
[SPEAKER_01]: We have an urban part of Medford and we have another part that identifies with Winchester or Arlington or whatever.

252
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:20,817
[SPEAKER_01]: And rightly so, it's a different topography, it's a different density.

253
00:23:21,497 --> 00:23:24,597
[SPEAKER_01]: So we kind of approached it that way.

254
00:23:24,918 --> 00:23:34,020
[SPEAKER_01]: What works in South Medford, Wellington, Glenwood, West Medford by the commuter rail area may not work in North Medford or the states.

255
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,322
[SPEAKER_01]: but one size does not fit all.

256
00:23:38,342 --> 00:23:52,852
[SPEAKER_01]: And we need a product, we need a parking policy that's dynamic, that changes based on need, that takes an annual review and sees what needs to be, it's just attention paid.

257
00:23:53,233 --> 00:23:55,454
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's an important part of our process.

258
00:23:56,375 --> 00:23:58,596
[SPEAKER_01]: We did not have an in-house policy before.

259
00:23:58,657 --> 00:24:00,118
[SPEAKER_01]: We did not have overseeing of

260
00:24:01,118 --> 00:24:01,618
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything.

261
00:24:02,178 --> 00:24:06,420
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it ran them up to a certain point we point that out strongly.

262
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:21,525
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have an opportunity, we have an opportunity to have these very simple growth, as we go along and allow a program to be dynamic and to work with the public and to ensure that people's needs are met.

263
00:24:22,577 --> 00:24:24,078
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's an important part of this.

264
00:24:24,578 --> 00:24:30,743
[SPEAKER_01]: So the green line had a lot to do with finally getting this change happening because it really is important.

265
00:24:32,246 --> 00:24:40,170
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a friend who lives on Princeton street and if when it snows, it's like, you know, there's some, like, you know, you can only be on one side of the street and she has kids.

266
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:44,932
[SPEAKER_00]: So she came over to my house before one of those snowstorms and she took an Uber because she couldn't move her car.

267
00:24:44,972 --> 00:24:45,913
[SPEAKER_00]: She would lose her spot.

268
00:24:46,353 --> 00:24:47,493
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's like, yeah.

269
00:24:47,633 --> 00:24:52,115
[SPEAKER_00]: And we live in North Medford where there's no like restrictions really on anything.

270
00:24:52,155 --> 00:24:55,017
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody cares what side of the street you park on in a snowstorm really.

271
00:24:55,057 --> 00:25:01,060
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's, yeah, it's really interesting to think about all the different considerations for the different parts of the city.

272
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:02,521
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.

273
00:25:02,981 --> 00:25:08,867
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean something as simple as enforcement of, you know, people are parking on the sidewalk they're parking the wrong way.

274
00:25:08,887 --> 00:25:12,791
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's, it's, it's not the fault of people from doing that.

275
00:25:12,971 --> 00:25:21,339
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't think there has ever been any sort of idea that this is a responsibility you have, you know how you live impact your neighbors decisions you make.

276
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,482
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is an important part of community.

277
00:25:24,942 --> 00:25:32,889
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an important part of getting the response back from people and to ensure that whatever you're presenting or providing, it's working for people.

278
00:25:33,309 --> 00:25:34,931
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's an important consideration.

279
00:25:35,051 --> 00:25:35,351
Yeah.

280
00:25:35,631 --> 00:25:40,055
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this parking program tied at all to the metered parking and the changes with that?

281
00:25:41,438 --> 00:25:50,083
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yes, so we made some recommendation made 21 recommendations on our report, and nobody loves the kiosk.

282
00:25:50,223 --> 00:25:53,745
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, people hate a kiosk, and I totally understand.

283
00:25:53,765 --> 00:25:55,486
[SPEAKER_01]: I use an app.

284
00:25:55,827 --> 00:25:59,769
[SPEAKER_01]: So, park the old park mobile that you use in some of the works of network.

285
00:26:00,029 --> 00:26:00,710
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we have our new

286
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:05,352
[SPEAKER_01]: pay by phone, which is the same one you have in Cambridge.

287
00:26:05,933 --> 00:26:10,135
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you drive places, you have an opportunity to use that one app.

288
00:26:10,295 --> 00:26:17,920
[SPEAKER_01]: But not a lot of people, as I said, a lot of people are very comfortable getting out and putting money in or actually using your app with the indicator.

289
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,381
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need to up our game.

290
00:26:20,441 --> 00:26:20,942
[SPEAKER_01]: We have

291
00:26:21,823 --> 00:26:31,800
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, some of these kiosks have never been updated the software has never been updated the batteries are dying, and some of it is the communication was like to G network.

292
00:26:32,281 --> 00:26:34,444
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's no longer even available so.

293
00:26:35,608 --> 00:26:41,292
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's time to upgrade, be purposeful and look at what your options are.

294
00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:43,894
[SPEAKER_01]: And convenience needs to be one of them.

295
00:26:44,275 --> 00:26:46,276
[SPEAKER_01]: Longevity needs to be the second one.

296
00:26:46,917 --> 00:26:53,602
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of our process, we actually reached out to three different vendors who do this kind of thing.

297
00:26:53,662 --> 00:26:56,004
[SPEAKER_01]: We went from uniforms to

298
00:26:57,422 --> 00:27:04,866
[SPEAKER_01]: decal to design to all of the soups, soup to nut, we handed a report and we handed resources.

299
00:27:05,407 --> 00:27:12,070
[SPEAKER_01]: And we looked at that and we did surveys based on how people had responded to those particular items.

300
00:27:12,691 --> 00:27:25,178
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, they were all metered, they were looking at flexibility, what can be done with those meters, even is something as simple as doing traffic study based on counting as pass or by would be helpful.

301
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:27,700
[SPEAKER_01]: for any planning, etc.

302
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:30,303
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, the kiosks are there.

303
00:27:30,443 --> 00:27:32,144
[SPEAKER_01]: The kiosks will be phased out.

304
00:27:32,185 --> 00:27:33,105
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my understanding.

305
00:27:33,145 --> 00:27:34,267
[SPEAKER_01]: That was our recommendation.

306
00:27:34,647 --> 00:27:37,910
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure there'll be more on this as we go along.

307
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:41,053
[SPEAKER_01]: As you know, the parking department just started.

308
00:27:42,034 --> 00:27:44,857
[SPEAKER_01]: Faye Morrison is the new parking director.

309
00:27:44,897 --> 00:27:45,177
[SPEAKER_01]: She's

310
00:27:46,158 --> 00:27:46,919
[SPEAKER_01]: unbelievable.

311
00:27:46,979 --> 00:27:47,859
[SPEAKER_01]: She's from Newton.

312
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:48,980
[SPEAKER_01]: She was there.

313
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,261
[SPEAKER_01]: She built their program.

314
00:27:50,861 --> 00:27:58,827
[SPEAKER_01]: She has been just somebody who it was just such a wonderful fit because she has all the equipment.

315
00:27:58,887 --> 00:28:00,208
[SPEAKER_01]: She knows what she's doing.

316
00:28:00,288 --> 00:28:07,753
[SPEAKER_01]: She's been there down this road and you get a great value from that because it's your eyes are wide open.

317
00:28:07,773 --> 00:28:08,333
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm hopeful

318
00:28:09,914 --> 00:28:12,556
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that things are sort of moving along.

319
00:28:13,157 --> 00:28:20,323
[SPEAKER_01]: But with parking, you also need to have policy that works to help you manage the process.

320
00:28:20,503 --> 00:28:24,706
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the policy part of that is an implementation process that's ongoing.

321
00:28:25,807 --> 00:28:29,609
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're all in this sort of way of moving forward.

322
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:42,256
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it's really kind of exciting because it gives us an opportunity to develop it the way that we see fit at based on our needs and based on a viable solution.

323
00:28:42,756 --> 00:28:44,997
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the opportunity that people have.

324
00:28:45,438 --> 00:28:46,658
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's exciting.

325
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:47,639
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

326
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:55,303
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you say the kiosks will be like, well, we'll be losing the kiosk, what will replace them would just be the using your phone.

327
00:28:57,342 --> 00:29:02,923
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still, no, I think they probably will go to a meter kind of environment, but a smart meter.

328
00:29:03,644 --> 00:29:04,964
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are some of the recommendations.

329
00:29:05,204 --> 00:29:15,326
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't seen since the recommendation what the plans are, but because the kiosks are reaching their end of life, they have to be replaced.

330
00:29:15,906 --> 00:29:22,148
[SPEAKER_01]: So a practical solution has always been the convenience of a meter, what people are used to.

331
00:29:23,248 --> 00:29:25,490
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, so these are recommendations that we made.

332
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:37,196
[SPEAKER_01]: I am not in part of the planning process and what's happening but I know that, you know, the mayor acted on recommendations, understands what needs to be accomplished.

333
00:29:37,236 --> 00:29:41,058
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, being a city councilor for 12 years before she was mayor, she's been there.

334
00:29:41,158 --> 00:29:43,859
[SPEAKER_01]: There are many times I've been in traffic commission meetings with her.

335
00:29:43,879 --> 00:29:44,440
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

336
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,820
[SPEAKER_01]: In regards to safety.

337
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:48,061
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we we you know, kind of gets it.

338
00:29:48,442 --> 00:29:49,522
[SPEAKER_01]: Um which is great.

339
00:29:49,582 --> 00:29:50,363
[SPEAKER_01]: It acts upon it.

340
00:29:50,483 --> 00:29:50,603
[SPEAKER_01]: So,

341
00:29:51,463 --> 00:30:01,648
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this will be, it's not, people have a hard time with change and I get that, but if they look at this as an opportunity to make it work for them, it's really going to be a game changer.

342
00:30:01,848 --> 00:30:02,229
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

343
00:30:02,829 --> 00:30:07,491
[SPEAKER_00]: I know myself, like when I hear, like parking really makes a difference for me if I'm going to go somewhere or not.

344
00:30:07,571 --> 00:30:13,594
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the, we used to live in the South end and we had, you know, the parking, the resident permits are zero dollars.

345
00:30:13,614 --> 00:30:18,397
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, that's because they're worthless because we got ticketed all the time, but the convenience of being able to park

346
00:30:18,917 --> 00:30:21,259
[SPEAKER_00]: really makes a difference and so it's exciting to hear.

347
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:23,341
[SPEAKER_01]: I lived in the south end for 22 years.

348
00:30:25,302 --> 00:30:27,524
[SPEAKER_00]: How many times did you get touched?

349
00:30:27,564 --> 00:30:30,266
[SPEAKER_01]: My office was on Clarendon Street until August of 2020.

350
00:30:30,367 --> 00:30:37,212
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, I've been there forever.

351
00:30:38,373 --> 00:30:44,258
[SPEAKER_00]: Great, so any other things that you want to mention or things that you're working on or events that you're excited about?

352
00:30:46,248 --> 00:30:48,930
[SPEAKER_01]: If we can bring up charter review just for a minute.

353
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:49,530
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

354
00:30:49,911 --> 00:30:52,452
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a very exciting time in Medford.

355
00:30:53,232 --> 00:30:56,714
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, an opportunity to discuss and talk about review.

356
00:30:59,276 --> 00:31:01,497
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, every community has the right to review.

357
00:31:01,517 --> 00:31:09,482
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think a lot of our sort of misinformation is the fact that

358
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:17,572
[SPEAKER_01]: There really hasn't been a great deal of resources available to people, unless you have to really look for and discover.

359
00:31:18,332 --> 00:31:28,695
[SPEAKER_01]: Having a beginning of the conversation and having a group of people who are sort of interested in working with community to kind of educate people on what the possibilities are.

360
00:31:28,976 --> 00:31:32,797
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is not a game changer or whatever.

361
00:31:32,917 --> 00:31:34,997
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just oftentimes just amendment.

362
00:31:35,317 --> 00:31:36,458
[SPEAKER_01]: Something as simple as,

363
00:31:37,659 --> 00:31:41,843
[SPEAKER_01]: an amendment that says to the charter, every five years, you're going to review your charter.

364
00:31:43,965 --> 00:31:45,266
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not 36 years.

365
00:31:47,608 --> 00:31:50,751
[SPEAKER_01]: And people did a great job before and made the changes.

366
00:31:51,052 --> 00:32:00,961
[SPEAKER_01]: Quite honestly, one of my first elections, if not my first, in 1978, was for the change of charter from Plan E, which is like Cambridge,

367
00:32:01,883 --> 00:32:04,225
[SPEAKER_01]: to plan A, which we currently have.

368
00:32:04,926 --> 00:32:07,248
[SPEAKER_01]: And that wasn't implemented until I believe 86.

369
00:32:07,708 --> 00:32:16,236
[SPEAKER_01]: So from 78 to 86, it took a little bit of time just to get the commission and all of that.

370
00:32:16,377 --> 00:32:21,902
[SPEAKER_01]: But we've looked at other communities who have made some changes with the city of Melrose, for instance,

371
00:32:22,342 --> 00:32:23,202
[SPEAKER_01]: some charter review.

372
00:32:23,922 --> 00:32:29,323
[SPEAKER_01]: City of Somerville is doing that now with a committee and they're incredibly resourceful.

373
00:32:29,383 --> 00:32:30,743
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a wonderful website.

374
00:32:31,143 --> 00:32:33,004
[SPEAKER_01]: They've invited us to their meetings.

375
00:32:33,524 --> 00:32:41,905
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a real community outreach and it's really a wonderful opportunity to see how things could work possibly.

376
00:32:41,925 --> 00:32:51,767
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I went to the committee of the whole where they were talking about the voting on the home rule petition and it seems like

377
00:32:53,767 --> 00:33:02,189
[SPEAKER_00]: There was some interesting, I thought, really important comments about democracy and the importance of being able to have, you know, the people's opinions really counting.

378
00:33:02,249 --> 00:33:07,990
[SPEAKER_00]: And the it's, it's, I know, there's a lot of people doing really great work to try to move this forward.

379
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:10,910
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems like, I don't know, it's, it should be easier.

380
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:19,872
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's Yeah, I think it's a, I'm really, like, interested in the prospects of word representation as being one of the outcomes that could come from trying to review.

381
00:33:19,912 --> 00:33:23,053
[SPEAKER_00]: And that seems like something that some people are scared of.

382
00:33:24,153 --> 00:33:43,667
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, again, we just have to have that opportunity to have that conversation, and we can't get over the threshold, but we can get over the threshold, because as we're going through this process we're learning there's other ways to sort of tackle this into look at this, you know, every city has the right to review.

383
00:33:44,928 --> 00:33:45,568
[SPEAKER_01]: They just do.

384
00:33:45,829 --> 00:33:46,309
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a right.

385
00:33:46,709 --> 00:33:50,131
[SPEAKER_01]: And nobody can sort of prevent you from doing that.

386
00:33:50,331 --> 00:33:51,652
[SPEAKER_01]: It just doesn't work that way.

387
00:33:52,332 --> 00:33:54,594
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, we'll see how this goes.

388
00:33:54,674 --> 00:33:57,055
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm a firm believer.

389
00:33:57,175 --> 00:33:59,216
[SPEAKER_01]: I never, I personally never give up.

390
00:33:59,276 --> 00:34:00,517
[SPEAKER_01]: I always like a challenge.

391
00:34:01,017 --> 00:34:03,719
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this has been, everything you do is a challenge, right?

392
00:34:03,739 --> 00:34:07,241
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd be wonderful if I just went to the gym and was just fantastic.

393
00:34:07,341 --> 00:34:08,162
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not the case.

394
00:34:08,242 --> 00:34:08,802
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always a challenge.

395
00:34:09,142 --> 00:34:12,485
[SPEAKER_01]: to continue and to be consistent and to do that.

396
00:34:12,885 --> 00:34:22,252
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we review our health, we review our financial considerations, our transportation, you know, our roof.

397
00:34:27,498 --> 00:34:27,778
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

398
00:34:27,938 --> 00:34:39,162
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and it sounds, and just for the history, it sounds like the, we've sent Charterview to the, to the state, but they've sort of, because there wasn't strong enough support in the city council, they didn't really take it up.

399
00:34:39,242 --> 00:34:40,322
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that what's happened in the past?

400
00:34:40,842 --> 00:34:41,042
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

401
00:34:41,382 --> 00:34:42,163
[SPEAKER_01]: That's very true.

402
00:34:42,243 --> 00:34:50,365
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, Mayor Burke had submitted, I think it was 20, I want to say 2017, maybe 2018.

403
00:34:50,545 --> 00:34:54,387
[SPEAKER_01]: I do apologize for the dates specific, but yes, it was.

404
00:34:54,767 --> 00:34:54,927
[SPEAKER_01]: And

405
00:34:56,506 --> 00:35:01,889
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a four three boat I believe in the city council and it went to the state and they said they send it back.

406
00:35:03,149 --> 00:35:03,890
[SPEAKER_01]: We have.

407
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:10,253
[SPEAKER_01]: We've done the, the work of doing the signatures to kind of bypass.

408
00:35:11,302 --> 00:35:29,454
[SPEAKER_01]: made over 5000 signatures before there's a certain percentage that we need to have of the number of voters, before we can submit it, and then there's all of this gathering aspect in a pandemic which has been difficult, but also, you know, the, the clerk's office has to go through all of them.

409
00:35:31,115 --> 00:35:35,658
[SPEAKER_01]: because it takes such a long period of time, people have moved, people have left, people have left.

410
00:35:37,299 --> 00:35:40,300
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the kind of an ongoing thing.

411
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,222
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to build in that buffer for those reasons.

412
00:35:43,843 --> 00:35:45,584
[SPEAKER_01]: So now, potentially, another 5,000 to 1,000.

413
00:35:46,084 --> 00:35:48,685
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have to look at how we're going to do that.

414
00:35:48,725 --> 00:35:50,326
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's the resource aspect.

415
00:35:50,406 --> 00:35:52,047
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we're volunteers.

416
00:35:52,648 --> 00:35:55,369
[SPEAKER_01]: Are people willing to commit two hours a week for the next 52 weeks?

417
00:35:56,770 --> 00:36:10,321
[SPEAKER_01]: If the hand is up and certainly but if you know it's hard people have a lot or involved with a lot of different things, but we need commitment it's like everything else right it's a challenge, but you need a commitment to make it work and.

418
00:36:11,041 --> 00:36:11,682
[SPEAKER_01]: To go together.

419
00:36:11,702 --> 00:36:14,684
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah.

420
00:36:14,844 --> 00:36:18,367
[SPEAKER_00]: Good luck, I hope it's I hope it's not a much longer rose.

421
00:36:19,362 --> 00:36:25,167
[SPEAKER_01]: We get to, we get to, we get to discover so many, you know, this is the thing that's wonderful about this group too.

422
00:36:25,227 --> 00:36:36,216
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, we have people who are incredibly progressive, incredibly conservative, and people in the middle, and we're all walking the same direction on the same street.

423
00:36:36,296 --> 00:36:37,497
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, when does this happen?

424
00:36:38,598 --> 00:36:43,546
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe daylight savings time but beyond that I don't I haven't heard of anything else.

425
00:36:44,007 --> 00:36:44,948
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exciting.

426
00:36:45,289 --> 00:36:52,320
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is exciting because then you work with folks, and they work with you and you accomplish something together and you no longer.

427
00:36:54,183 --> 00:37:19,778
[SPEAKER_01]: pieces you oftentimes you're no longer suspicious you're like wow this person really has the same as me yeah and it's so it's it's sort of a way of really focusing people in a healthy way yeah it's the yeah personal opinion it is like the striking part about charter review that it is so there is so much of a consensus in terms like with the voters around it and it's it is a confusing part too to me about like what's the what's the hold up here but

428
00:37:20,352 --> 00:37:37,648
[SPEAKER_01]: We have our work, we have our work ahead of us, and we are, you know, I rebuilt the website just yesterday or the day before to give more options to give more information by, you know, added language translation, I, it's so it's sort of we're building that.

429
00:37:37,948 --> 00:37:39,230
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are the things that

430
00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:50,905
[SPEAKER_01]: are important to help people sort of see what we're doing and see what we can all do together to potentially review this product we call government.

431
00:37:52,427 --> 00:37:53,188
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, awesome.

432
00:37:53,989 --> 00:37:57,614
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, any other things that are coming up for you that you want to mention?

433
00:37:59,132 --> 00:38:01,213
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hopeful I'm going to vacation.

434
00:38:01,233 --> 00:38:02,334
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm kidding.

435
00:38:03,175 --> 00:38:14,942
[SPEAKER_01]: I honestly, again, I'm available anytime at my website, my email, JFSILVA at SMRTO.org.

[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

438
00:38:28,555 --> 00:38:29,035
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

439
00:38:30,356 --> 00:38:36,180
[SPEAKER_00]: These seem like all, you know, all the things that you've mentioned today seem like pretty complex processes.

440
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:41,483
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's nice to have a point, you know, to know that there's somebody that we can reach out to if their questions are concerned.

441
00:38:42,524 --> 00:38:42,664

444
00:38:45,826 --> 00:38:50,069
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I, yeah, this feels like a good place to wrap up unless there's anything else you have to mention.

[SPEAKER_01]: just get involved.

446

450
00:39:05,583 --> 00:39:10,824
