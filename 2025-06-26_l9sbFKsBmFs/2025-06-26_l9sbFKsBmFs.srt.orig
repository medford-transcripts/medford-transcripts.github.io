1
00:00:00,091 --> 00:00:00,351
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.

2
00:00:00,491 --> 00:00:03,452
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I believe we have our full board for tonight.

3
00:00:05,152 --> 00:00:07,733
[SPEAKER_03]: Great, let's go ahead and get started short agenda tonight.

4
00:00:09,173 --> 00:00:12,954
[SPEAKER_03]: In with some of our obligatory announcements.

5
00:00:13,735 --> 00:00:16,295
[SPEAKER_03]: First, pursuant to Chapter 20 of the acts of 2021.

6
00:00:16,375 --> 00:00:22,197
[SPEAKER_03]: This hearing of the Medford Community Development Board will be conducted via remote means.

7
00:00:23,193 --> 00:00:32,502
[SPEAKER_03]: No in person attendance of members of the public will be permitted and public participation in any public hearing during this meeting shall be by remote means only.

8
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,091
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome everyone to tonight's meeting.

9
00:00:35,111 --> 00:00:42,193
[SPEAKER_03]: A reminder that materials for this meeting, and all of our meetings are available on the city's website.

10
00:00:43,133 --> 00:00:54,997
[SPEAKER_03]: If you go to the website go under boards and commissions, click on community development board that's your quickest way to materials, click on current CD board filings to see what we're talking about in any given meeting.

11
00:00:57,958 --> 00:01:01,920
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess we should do a roll call first and then we'll get to our first order of business.

12
00:01:03,088 --> 00:01:03,828
[SPEAKER_03]: Jackie Furtado.

13
00:01:04,929 --> 00:01:05,149
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

14
00:01:06,469 --> 00:01:08,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Christy doubt here.

15
00:01:10,231 --> 00:01:10,931
[SPEAKER_03]: Deanna Peabody.

16
00:01:13,172 --> 00:01:23,415
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm David Bloomberg, and we're pleased to welcome a new member of the board although I think he's just sort of watching and, and learning the ropes.

17
00:01:24,135 --> 00:01:30,037
[SPEAKER_03]: This month but will be a full member next month and that's, that's George Fisher, George welcome aboard.

18
00:01:33,342 --> 00:01:34,543
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome, George.

19
00:01:35,023 --> 00:01:37,425
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great to add you to the team here.

20
00:01:37,985 --> 00:01:42,868
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to just say hello for as short or as long as you like, no pressure.

21
00:01:43,888 --> 00:01:44,169
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.

22
00:01:44,809 --> 00:01:45,829
[SPEAKER_10]: My name is George Fisher.

23
00:01:45,849 --> 00:01:55,815
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm working as a landscape architect and I've lived in Medford for 43 years now, three and a half years.

24
00:01:57,456 --> 00:02:00,178
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm pleased to call Medford my home and I'm excited to

25
00:02:01,122 --> 00:02:04,103
[SPEAKER_10]: make it a great place to live with all of you guys and work together.

26
00:02:05,504 --> 00:02:12,167
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great, great to have you on board and especially with your architecture background wonderful to add that to the team.

27
00:02:13,267 --> 00:02:16,049
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah, always happy to do more.

28
00:02:17,149 --> 00:02:17,669
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.

29
00:02:19,975 --> 00:02:23,477
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well, we only have a couple of matters on the agenda tonight.

30
00:02:23,537 --> 00:02:28,480
[SPEAKER_03]: The first is an approval not required plan at 69 Horn Ave.

31
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:37,604
[SPEAKER_03]: And I understand we do have some folks here from that team who would like to present to the board this evening.

32
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:42,167
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

33
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,770
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't get my picture up.

34
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:48,870
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Bob Ryan.

35
00:02:49,051 --> 00:02:53,531
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the executor and trustee of Joe McGurn's property.

36
00:02:54,811 --> 00:03:03,013
[SPEAKER_01]: And part of his property is going to be going to charity.

37
00:03:03,053 --> 00:03:14,835
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have to get all my ducks in a row to get the highest and best use of the property so that I can present that to the Attorney General's office, who actually is involved when charity becomes part of an estate.

38
00:03:16,447 --> 00:03:20,090
[SPEAKER_01]: Chuck Andre has been helping me, he's a broker on the property.

39
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:27,415
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've enlisted Medford Engineering to do the survey.

40
00:03:28,135 --> 00:03:35,380
[SPEAKER_01]: Because as you probably are aware, there are three parcels of land, one has a house on it currently, and two other parcels are undeveloped.

41
00:03:35,641 --> 00:03:39,964
[SPEAKER_01]: But each of those parcels are slightly below the current zoning limit to build.

42
00:03:40,964 --> 00:03:45,888
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we're trying to do is merge the properties together and divide them in half.

43
00:03:46,695 --> 00:04:00,105
[SPEAKER_01]: so that the two lesser properties, the two properties that are slightly undersized become large enough to build on, and we can then sell the property either as one or two parcels.

44
00:04:00,926 --> 00:04:04,588
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, Mr. Ryan, not to cut you short there, I appreciate the intro.

45
00:04:04,809 --> 00:04:08,872
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we get some visuals, whether you or someone on your team has some visuals?

46
00:04:09,492 --> 00:04:10,313
[SPEAKER_01]: Your visual of me?

47
00:04:11,373 --> 00:04:13,415
[SPEAKER_01]: You really don't want it, but I'm not sure how to do that.

48
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:17,492
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy to, I'm happy to throw up.

49
00:04:18,212 --> 00:04:21,155
[SPEAKER_00]: I can throw, I can share the plan document.

50
00:04:22,135 --> 00:04:24,297
[SPEAKER_00]: We can, let me take a look here.

51
00:04:24,817 --> 00:04:28,560
[SPEAKER_02]: Amanda, there is, this is Chuckie Andrew from Remax in Medford Square.

52
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,261
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't tell who's on the air.

53
00:04:30,322 --> 00:04:31,502
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see Bob.

54
00:04:31,582 --> 00:04:34,024
[SPEAKER_02]: Is Richard Mead on from Medford Engineering?

55
00:04:36,306 --> 00:04:37,367
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't see them yet.

56
00:04:37,387 --> 00:04:39,789
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

57
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:42,871
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't have the documents, I believe.

58
00:04:44,502 --> 00:04:50,147
[SPEAKER_02]: The documents were, I submitted the documents to Amanda and you're going to put them up, right?

59
00:04:50,868 --> 00:04:51,148
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

60
00:04:51,228 --> 00:04:53,750
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me quickly do that.

61
00:04:57,633 --> 00:05:02,598
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the plan set that you guys provided us.

62
00:05:07,262 --> 00:05:08,763
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's certainly better than my picture.

63
00:05:14,497 --> 00:05:16,638
[SPEAKER_06]: Bob, we're disappointed we can't see your face.

64
00:05:18,098 --> 00:05:18,519
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't be.

65
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,081
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so if you don't mind, just sort of walk us through.

66
00:05:25,101 --> 00:05:29,203
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got a couple of lots here, lot one and lot two.

67
00:05:29,343 --> 00:05:31,564
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want me to do it, Bob?

68
00:05:32,705 --> 00:05:35,065
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't have any slides.

69
00:05:35,146 --> 00:05:36,026
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't seen this.

70
00:05:36,606 --> 00:05:42,809
[SPEAKER_02]: So the parcel on the right is an existing home at 69 Horn Ave, which Amanda's circling.

71
00:05:43,784 --> 00:05:49,629
[SPEAKER_02]: The two lots to the left are both, Amanda, were they 2 hundreds or 3 600s?

72
00:05:50,189 --> 00:05:50,669
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot.

73
00:05:52,271 --> 00:05:56,494
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'd have to have to look.

74
00:05:56,934 --> 00:06:00,777
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, there are two vacant lots, folks.

75
00:06:01,138 --> 00:06:08,143
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at this, the square there and the first lot with a house on it actually ends before the driveway.

76
00:06:08,223 --> 00:06:08,964
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you

77
00:06:09,495 --> 00:06:12,278
[SPEAKER_01]: took that square and divided it in three equal sections.

78
00:06:12,798 --> 00:06:14,500
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the way the property is currently.

79
00:06:15,321 --> 00:06:27,553
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we're trying to do is take the two lots to the left and leave the driveway with the house and the remaining part of the middle lot and the left-handed lot, merge them together for one lot.

80
00:06:27,593 --> 00:06:31,537
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're making three lots, three equal lots into two equal lots.

81
00:06:36,045 --> 00:06:39,426
[SPEAKER_07]: If I may, David, this is Jackie, vice chair.

82
00:06:40,267 --> 00:06:50,610
[SPEAKER_07]: Before the proponent moves forward, Amanda or Alicia, if you can provide some background, I know on A&R generally, we must have enough frontage.

83
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:51,570
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what we're looking for.

84
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:59,152
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause it doesn't really necessarily require a formal review process by the planning board, but we have to make sure that there's proper frontage.

85
00:06:59,253 --> 00:06:59,873
[SPEAKER_07]: Am I correct?

86
00:07:00,673 --> 00:07:03,274
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm unable to do that as presented.

87
00:07:04,014 --> 00:07:07,837
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to be a little bit more clear before the proponent continues.

88
00:07:08,897 --> 00:07:09,618
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, totally.

89
00:07:09,678 --> 00:07:16,282
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking for at least 25 feet of frontage on a way, an acceptable way.

90
00:07:17,082 --> 00:07:20,224
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, I believe Horn Avenue is a public way.

91
00:07:22,326 --> 00:07:31,171
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you take a look here, so it looks like this lot two, we have 71 feet of frontage.

92
00:07:33,714 --> 00:07:37,996
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on lot one, we've got 64 feet of frontage.

93
00:07:38,196 --> 00:07:41,198
[SPEAKER_00]: So the three things are, is it on a way?

94
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:46,561
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the correct amount of frontage or meeting a minimum?

95
00:07:47,061 --> 00:07:53,845
[SPEAKER_00]: And is vital access to the property possible as configured?

96
00:07:59,834 --> 00:08:05,659
[SPEAKER_04]: And to be clear, you can't take a property that has a building on it and make it non-conforming.

97
00:08:06,039 --> 00:08:11,063
[SPEAKER_04]: So they have to be two buildable lots and the existing property.

98
00:08:11,364 --> 00:08:14,346
[SPEAKER_04]: So I didn't actually realize that the original was three lots.

99
00:08:14,526 --> 00:08:24,475
[SPEAKER_04]: I assumed the way this was presented that this was one lot being subdivided into two because I didn't see original property lines drawn on this.

100
00:08:25,936 --> 00:08:26,897
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, there were three.

101
00:08:27,427 --> 00:08:30,069
[SPEAKER_01]: three pieces of property that are all equal.

102
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:33,712
[SPEAKER_01]: And the house was built on the first one.

103
00:08:33,752 --> 00:08:39,677
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, I guess it's conforming as when it was built.

104
00:08:39,757 --> 00:08:43,700
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other two pieces of property are 4770 each as far as square footage.

105
00:08:47,763 --> 00:08:48,743
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, thank you, Amanda.

106
00:08:48,823 --> 00:08:58,826
[SPEAKER_03]: I was hoping we could perhaps have it described in connection with these lots, because I think that maybe this will make the connection for all of us who are following along.

107
00:08:59,646 --> 00:09:00,107
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

108
00:09:00,187 --> 00:09:12,050
[SPEAKER_00]: So please, Chuck, correct me if I'm mistaken, but I believe that the three lots in question are this one here, which has the structure on it.

109
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:12,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on.

110
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:14,611
[SPEAKER_02]: I have Metro Engineering calling in.

111
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:15,651
[SPEAKER_02]: Chuck, how are you?

112
00:09:20,094 --> 00:09:20,834
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thank you.

113
00:09:22,755 --> 00:09:24,516
[SPEAKER_02]: Method engineering is coming right on.

114
00:09:24,576 --> 00:09:26,317
[SPEAKER_02]: For some reason, something got tied up.

115
00:09:26,597 --> 00:09:33,240
[SPEAKER_02]: But Amanda, yes, where your pointer is, okay, that's the existing home.

116
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:37,682
[SPEAKER_02]: If you drop your pointer right up to the top there, that's it.

117
00:09:38,282 --> 00:09:40,824
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are two vacant lots that have been vacant.

118
00:09:42,433 --> 00:09:44,874
[SPEAKER_02]: in perpetuity to the right.

119
00:09:45,354 --> 00:09:54,879
[SPEAKER_02]: So the idea is, as one of the board members said, I think it was the vice chair, obviously we wouldn't make the existing house non-conforming.

120
00:09:54,999 --> 00:10:09,146
[SPEAKER_02]: So we would increase the square footage for the existing home and then have a 7,500 square foot lot with sufficient frontage and depth setbacks and sidelines on those two existing parcels.

121
00:10:09,926 --> 00:10:24,260
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're basically looking to move the line over from the existing property at 69 and creating a buildable lot of 7,500 square feet in that area where Amanda's circling.

122
00:10:25,522 --> 00:10:30,026
[SPEAKER_02]: And in that area, the minimum requirement for a lot is 5,000 square feet.

123
00:10:40,872 --> 00:10:42,473
[SPEAKER_03]: Any other questions?

124
00:10:42,513 --> 00:10:46,614
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want Medford Engineering to speak to the board specifically?

125
00:10:46,774 --> 00:10:50,575
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Chairman, he just called.

126
00:10:50,635 --> 00:10:53,056
[SPEAKER_02]: He was in traffic, as everyone else was today.

127
00:10:53,877 --> 00:10:55,757
[SPEAKER_02]: He just, I guess, is punching in.

128
00:10:55,817 --> 00:10:59,539
[SPEAKER_02]: Amanda, do you see Richard Mean coming in from Medford Engineering?

129
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:03,400
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll let you guys know when they pop up.

130
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:12,589
[SPEAKER_04]: So does the board have other questions while we wait for them?

131
00:11:12,609 --> 00:11:20,152
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a question from a member of the public that I would share, but the board should absolutely ask their questions first.

132
00:11:21,193 --> 00:11:22,674
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there any other questions from the board?

133
00:11:22,694 --> 00:11:24,714
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's kind of where I was going.

134
00:11:24,734 --> 00:11:30,737
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't want to shorten, change Medford engineering if they'd like to speak, but do we have any other questions at this point?

135
00:11:32,758 --> 00:11:32,818
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

136
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:33,078
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

137
00:11:33,738 --> 00:11:36,940
[SPEAKER_03]: So Alicia, please, if we know that there's another question out there, please.

138
00:11:37,369 --> 00:11:54,834
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, it's one of the neighbors reached out to me and thought that there might be some wetland on the property, conservation area, and it is my understanding through zoning that that doesn't prevent the property from being subdivided.

139
00:11:55,914 --> 00:12:05,497
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't prevent the A&R in any sense, but I thought it was a worthwhile question to raise because she thought that it might not actually be a buildable lot.

140
00:12:06,157 --> 00:12:13,622
[SPEAKER_04]: um, after the subdivision, depending on if there is in fact wetland there in the space of it, is that, do you know anything about that or?

141
00:12:14,322 --> 00:12:27,371
[SPEAKER_02]: Medford engineering could address that better than I, but my experience in that area and the folks that have looked at that have, have asked that question and there was no evidence of any wetlands whatsoever.

142
00:12:27,391 --> 00:12:28,111
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

143
00:12:28,171 --> 00:12:29,292
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

144
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:31,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Great, thank you.

145
00:12:31,331 --> 00:12:33,333
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll convey that back to the resident.

146
00:12:33,633 --> 00:12:40,439
[SPEAKER_04]: She knew that the property owner was a great environmentalist, and that he really treasured the open space there.

147
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:51,910
[SPEAKER_02]: And just so you know, I mean, the intent there is to build one single family, one nice single family house that would fit into that neighborhood.

148
00:12:58,392 --> 00:13:02,294
[SPEAKER_06]: Absent any other questions, do we have a motion?

149
00:13:07,878 --> 00:13:10,979
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we make a motion for the approval not required?

150
00:13:12,801 --> 00:13:14,902
[SPEAKER_04]: I do believe you have to vote on them.

151
00:13:15,122 --> 00:13:17,363
[SPEAKER_04]: And in the end, you have to sign the Mylar.

152
00:13:19,224 --> 00:13:23,027
[SPEAKER_09]: I make a motion to approve the plan as is.

153
00:13:24,768 --> 00:13:25,488
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a second?

154
00:13:28,856 --> 00:13:44,871
[SPEAKER_07]: Before we move to the final vote, David, I just want to make sure, going back to what Alicia says, although the wetland will not preclude the approval for the ANR, if the lot is not buildable, will that have any kind of bearing going forward or are we able to just approve it as is?

155
00:13:46,013 --> 00:14:03,661
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the way that at least the way I would think about it is there's a whole level I mean when, when the property owner is going to go to the city for approval to build their all of that stuff can be analyzed at that time this is really just a question of whether it is a subdivision that subject to subdivision control.

156
00:14:04,461 --> 00:14:12,904
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think we have a very limited review here, and really it's just a confirmation of what is factually what it is.

157
00:14:14,624 --> 00:14:17,505
[SPEAKER_07]: which it meets the minimum requirements of square footage.

158
00:14:17,685 --> 00:14:22,167
[SPEAKER_07]: I will vote, I'll second the approval of the ANR.

159
00:14:23,148 --> 00:14:23,688
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.

160
00:14:24,788 --> 00:14:28,330
[SPEAKER_03]: And having a second now on the motion, we'll have a roll call vote.

161
00:14:29,831 --> 00:14:30,551
[SPEAKER_03]: Jackie Furtado.

162
00:14:31,611 --> 00:14:31,852
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

163
00:14:32,852 --> 00:14:33,392
[SPEAKER_03]: Christy Dell.

164
00:14:34,453 --> 00:14:34,673
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

165
00:14:35,573 --> 00:14:36,233
[SPEAKER_03]: Deanna Peabody.

166
00:14:37,014 --> 00:14:37,234
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

167
00:14:38,234 --> 00:14:39,735
[SPEAKER_03]: And myself, I'm also a yes.

168
00:14:40,615 --> 00:14:43,737
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much to everyone who appeared on this matter.

169
00:14:43,837 --> 00:14:44,397
[SPEAKER_03]: Appreciate it.

170
00:14:45,496 --> 00:14:46,896
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, I appreciate your time.

171
00:14:47,396 --> 00:14:48,657
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much to the board.

172
00:14:49,977 --> 00:14:52,518
[SPEAKER_02]: Just one question so I can answer to Mr. Ryan.

173
00:14:52,998 --> 00:14:58,079
[SPEAKER_02]: Amanda, that will be the mile I will be signed and we can pick it up at City Hall.

174
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:07,061
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, yeah, so I will circulate that around to the board members here to get all those signatures and keep you in the loop on when it's ready.

175
00:15:07,441 --> 00:15:09,422
[SPEAKER_00]: And then yes, we would do the handoff.

176
00:15:10,062 --> 00:15:11,602
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you to the board members very much.

177
00:15:12,182 --> 00:15:12,762
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you again.

178
00:15:12,802 --> 00:15:13,523
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a good evening.

179
00:15:13,983 --> 00:15:14,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, bye bye.

180
00:15:17,548 --> 00:15:22,593
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, friends, next item on the agenda is a set of minutes.

181
00:15:22,653 --> 00:15:29,138
[SPEAKER_03]: We have three separate meeting minutes that need approval.

182
00:15:29,158 --> 00:15:31,360
[SPEAKER_03]: We have January 13th of 2022, January 9th, I mean, June 9th of 2022, June 22nd of 2022.

183
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,582
[SPEAKER_03]: Any comments on one or more of these sets of minutes?

184
00:15:47,403 --> 00:15:57,549
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I might have given him into like one, one typo kind of item to be updated but that was all I saw when I reviewed them.

185
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:00,931
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have any questions other.

186
00:16:01,172 --> 00:16:08,636
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean I don't have any input, other than, are we able to approve them tonight and we have a quorum for the minutes because of fools.

187
00:16:10,201 --> 00:16:12,503
[SPEAKER_07]: Andre LaRose not in attendance.

188
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:14,405
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just wanted to make sure that we had enough.

189
00:16:14,945 --> 00:16:18,408
[SPEAKER_04]: So Jackie, technically you can vote on minutes, even if you weren't there.

190
00:16:18,428 --> 00:16:32,660
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel that we, I find that board members often prefer not to, if they weren't there, if there's quorum, but with members leaving the board, then we end up needing to just have people who weren't there vote.

191
00:16:33,595 --> 00:16:54,767
[SPEAKER_00]: okay so it's allowed it's just you know generally you might say well i don't know if they're okay but you can trust your your co-members if you want and i think luckily for us that um i mean so long as everyone is in agreement um we would have quorum with four folks out of the seven um to to vote tonight

192
00:16:56,923 --> 00:16:58,364
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just have a question.

193
00:16:59,845 --> 00:17:20,438
[SPEAKER_09]: When I was reading the minutes for the RISE development, one of my big focuses was on making sure that there is some teeth in the agreement for them to negotiate with future tenants for the vocational school and having those basically workforce development and training opportunities.

194
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:27,583
[SPEAKER_09]: But reading back to the minutes, I didn't see that we actually made that as a condition.

195
00:17:27,603 --> 00:17:35,750
[SPEAKER_09]: It was more about the community use of the commercial space on the ground floor, unless I missed that.

196
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:49,161
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't, you know, if we didn't, we didn't, but I guess it doesn't really have anything to do with the minutes, but maybe that's something we can circle back and you can remind me how they're actually being

197
00:17:50,317 --> 00:17:56,118
[SPEAKER_09]: held to that condition, or if we, what's happening with that development.

198
00:17:56,358 --> 00:18:00,339
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, reading the minutes again just reminded me of that.

199
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,440
[SPEAKER_03]: Amanda, do you want to respond to that first?

200
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,140
[SPEAKER_03]: I certainly concur with Christie's observation.

201
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:16,482
[SPEAKER_03]: It didn't occur to me when I read the minutes, so I can't off the top of my head remember whether there's a bullet point in there for that point or not, but I think it's an excellent point she's raising.

202
00:18:17,303 --> 00:18:19,363
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would think that it would have been included

203
00:18:21,373 --> 00:18:29,275
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I'm just looking for the copy of the recommendation to the ZBA to take a look.

204
00:18:43,486 --> 00:18:50,091
[SPEAKER_00]: know, I'm not sure we in the condition that's included is more so about the programming space.

205
00:18:50,131 --> 00:18:57,116
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's that the programming space be available to the public and for scheduling and hosting community groups at reasonable hours and frequency.

206
00:18:57,136 --> 00:19:00,399
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's all I saw, too.

207
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:00,579
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

208
00:19:01,074 --> 00:19:22,862
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know they submitted a letter before we voted to recommend approval between like the vocational school and everything but I don't know if I guess this is a topic maybe for another time but that are that a pretty important aspect of that development so it'd be nice to know how the city can have some teeth in that.

209
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:27,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there other comments?

210
00:19:28,188 --> 00:19:38,033
[SPEAKER_03]: If that's the only one, maybe we want to hold the minutes for, I presume those are the two June meetings, Amanda.

211
00:19:38,533 --> 00:19:45,416
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's the later June 22nd is when we discussed conditions.

212
00:19:46,097 --> 00:19:46,417
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

213
00:19:46,857 --> 00:19:50,439
[SPEAKER_03]: My recollection was the conditions were in both of them.

214
00:19:50,479 --> 00:19:51,059
[SPEAKER_03]: It was sort of like

215
00:19:52,593 --> 00:20:00,901
[SPEAKER_03]: prepped up in the first one and then perhaps definitively approved or recommended in the second one.

216
00:20:02,142 --> 00:20:05,965
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, yeah, let me see.

217
00:20:09,689 --> 00:20:12,992
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I don't think we made a condition about that.

218
00:20:13,012 --> 00:20:16,975
[SPEAKER_09]: It must have flipped through, I think.

219
00:20:17,436 --> 00:20:18,857
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember that being a condition.

220
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:28,631
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, yeah, I do see some condition language in the six, nine minutes as well.

221
00:20:28,851 --> 00:20:31,552
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe we hold on both of those.

222
00:20:32,752 --> 00:20:46,836
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so if it's okay with the rest of the board, perhaps we can just table the June, the two meeting minutes from June and entertain a motion on the January minutes for approval.

223
00:20:52,218 --> 00:20:53,338
[SPEAKER_03]: Would anyone be so daring?

224
00:20:56,698 --> 00:20:57,098
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds good.

225
00:20:58,639 --> 00:21:02,382
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, sounds like a motion to approve the January minutes from Deanna.

226
00:21:02,442 --> 00:21:03,082
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a second?

227
00:21:04,343 --> 00:21:04,904
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll second.

228
00:21:05,064 --> 00:21:05,824
[SPEAKER_07]: This is Jackie.

229
00:21:06,585 --> 00:21:06,965
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.

230
00:21:07,646 --> 00:21:11,688
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's have roll call vote then to approve the minutes, board minutes from January 13, 2022.

231
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:15,271
[SPEAKER_03]: Kristy Dowd.

232
00:21:16,151 --> 00:21:16,372
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

233
00:21:17,893 --> 00:21:18,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Deanna Peabody.

234
00:21:19,474 --> 00:21:19,674
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

235
00:21:20,474 --> 00:21:21,255
[SPEAKER_03]: Jackie Furtado.

236
00:21:21,855 --> 00:21:22,115
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

237
00:21:23,276 --> 00:21:24,217
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm a yes as well.

238
00:21:28,312 --> 00:21:30,714
[SPEAKER_03]: And we can put the other ones off until our next meeting Amanda.

239
00:21:31,374 --> 00:21:31,894
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds good.

240
00:21:32,415 --> 00:21:33,816
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, that sounds great.

241
00:21:35,057 --> 00:21:40,720
[SPEAKER_03]: Amanda you have some updates for us no pressure but this could be the quickest meeting in the history of board.

242
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:44,743
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'll keep it to a clip.

243
00:21:45,744 --> 00:21:50,607
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so give it the give it the time it deserves.

244
00:21:51,067 --> 00:21:51,688
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm only kidding.

245
00:21:52,254 --> 00:21:53,575
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.

246
00:21:54,256 --> 00:21:59,039
[SPEAKER_00]: We've received two site plan review applications from Tufts University for student housing.

247
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:08,026
[SPEAKER_00]: They're two separate applications, but they're both kind of called co-housing or co-ho, and they both fall under the Dover Amendment.

248
00:22:08,546 --> 00:22:16,532
[SPEAKER_00]: So the standards for review are going to be a little bit different than a typical site plan review, and the performance standards won't apply.

249
00:22:17,413 --> 00:22:33,799
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to provide some more information to the board as we get closer about, you know, what is expected, but generally speaking it's it's not unfamiliar territory for you guys and it's actually a little less stringent in some ways than a traditional site plan review.

250
00:22:35,639 --> 00:22:48,070
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting note and I know Amanda will share the ordinance the updated ordinance with us when she distributes the materials but there's a separate little section on on Dover amendment.

251
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:58,618
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, whereas our regular site plan review is pretty detailed this one very very short so, but want to consult that before we ever made.

252
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:05,144
[SPEAKER_07]: To be clear, Dover Amendment covers the use of educational, educational uses, correct?

253
00:23:05,224 --> 00:23:10,448
[SPEAKER_07]: Just like I know there's one for specifically for religious uses, like we need a lot.

254
00:23:10,929 --> 00:23:13,491
[SPEAKER_07]: So yes, it's the same thing.

255
00:23:13,531 --> 00:23:13,811
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

256
00:23:13,831 --> 00:23:18,635
[SPEAKER_00]: So religious institutions and educational institutions fall under the Dover Amendment.

257
00:23:19,256 --> 00:23:19,396
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

258
00:23:23,598 --> 00:23:30,606
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, so my question about this to the folks here is, we want to think a little bit about scheduling.

259
00:23:32,007 --> 00:23:40,437
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the, so the week of October 10th is when we're able to start having a meeting about this.

260
00:23:41,057 --> 00:23:44,521
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's after there's like an obligatory 35 day period.

261
00:23:44,661 --> 00:23:57,713
[SPEAKER_00]: So for that week, I spoke with the project applicant and they said that only October 12th works, which gosh, I have to remember what day of the week that is, which I think is a Wednesday.

262
00:23:57,753 --> 00:24:00,255
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know Jackie, that that is not so great for you.

263
00:24:00,275 --> 00:24:02,678
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a Wednesday.

264
00:24:03,336 --> 00:24:03,696
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

265
00:24:04,677 --> 00:24:10,043
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess I wanted to see what other members availability was for that day.

266
00:24:10,264 --> 00:24:16,871
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also look at a couple of days the following week to offer up to the applicant.

267
00:24:23,828 --> 00:24:25,889
[SPEAKER_07]: Amanda, I'm usually not available on Wednesdays.

268
00:24:25,969 --> 00:24:49,316
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a little bit difficult for me going into, based on what my other commitments are, but I can probably try to move things around for that date, because it'll be easier for me to have October 12th to look at, as opposed to everything else, because this is the Baker-Polito administration's last year, and they are going, we're about to do the one-stop announcements soon, and they're trying to pack it all in in October, November.

269
00:24:49,856 --> 00:24:52,297
[SPEAKER_07]: December, so I don't know when I'll be available.

270
00:24:52,317 --> 00:24:56,058
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will try to shoot for October 12th if need be.

271
00:24:56,438 --> 00:24:56,758
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

272
00:24:57,319 --> 00:24:58,099
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Jackie.

273
00:24:59,139 --> 00:24:59,919
[SPEAKER_00]: What about others?

274
00:24:59,939 --> 00:25:08,903
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I heard Deanna, yes.

275
00:25:08,983 --> 00:25:09,703
[SPEAKER_00]: David, yes.

276
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:11,083
[SPEAKER_00]: Christy, yes.

277
00:25:11,723 --> 00:25:12,024
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

278
00:25:13,144 --> 00:25:14,084
[SPEAKER_00]: George, what about you?

279
00:25:14,905 --> 00:25:15,825
[SPEAKER_10]: October 12th works.

280
00:25:16,495 --> 00:25:17,097
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, great.

281
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,388
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll reach out to class and Emily as well.

282
00:25:22,446 --> 00:25:25,488
[SPEAKER_00]: but potentially five folks here that might be able to make it work.

283
00:25:25,528 --> 00:25:27,370
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a good start.

284
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:28,571
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, thank you all.

285
00:25:30,272 --> 00:25:30,772
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving on.

286
00:25:32,454 --> 00:25:42,782
[SPEAKER_00]: We are also likely expecting a site plan review application from the Medford Housing Authority for 121 Riverside, which is their salt install building.

287
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:47,305
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gonna be rehabbing mostly like the interior of the building.

288
00:25:48,466 --> 00:25:53,727
[SPEAKER_00]: So it will remain the same footprint, but they'll kind of reutilize the space.

289
00:25:53,827 --> 00:26:03,329
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're increasing the units count from about 200 to maybe 220 or so for senior and disability housing.

290
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:09,071
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are considering requesting a waiver for the traffic study.

291
00:26:10,331 --> 00:26:14,672
[SPEAKER_00]: They've started having some conversations with the city and in particular Todd Blake about that.

292
00:26:17,339 --> 00:26:32,378
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll submit a memo to him, and we're wondering if there would be maybe an opportunity for you all to review, because it is within the board's authority if they so choose to authorize a waiver on certain application materials.

293
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:41,784
[SPEAKER_00]: I was thinking that the next October meeting, perhaps that October 12th could be a good opportunity for that.

294
00:26:41,884 --> 00:26:55,112
[SPEAKER_00]: You could hear a little bit about the project and also in theory have this memo in hand and Todd Blake's input, who's the director of traffic and transportation and kind of use that to discuss whether you feel it's appropriate.

295
00:26:56,713 --> 00:26:58,834
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that sound reasonable to the board?

296
00:26:59,034 --> 00:26:59,214
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

297
00:26:59,854 --> 00:27:00,395
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds good.

298
00:27:01,904 --> 00:27:03,105
[SPEAKER_00]: Great, okay.

299
00:27:05,667 --> 00:27:08,069
[SPEAKER_00]: Good, and then just a couple more updates.

300
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:17,517
[SPEAKER_00]: So 100 Winchester Street, it's a 64 unit residential development, and they held a neighborhood meeting on August 29th.

301
00:27:18,598 --> 00:27:26,664
[SPEAKER_00]: They are planning to submit what will probably be the first planned development district application in late September or early October.

302
00:27:27,525 --> 00:27:30,407
[SPEAKER_00]: So just something that's on the horizon that I wanted to flag for you guys.

303
00:27:31,428 --> 00:27:42,818
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and we've been working in the office and also with some input from David, um, on developing, uh, plan development district approval process and outline.

304
00:27:43,419 --> 00:27:50,065
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so we'll share that with, uh, the board as a reference as we, um, kind of tighten that up and get closer to that process.

305
00:27:50,983 --> 00:28:03,967
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lastly, Combined Properties is holding two neighborhood meetings next week to introduce their master plan proposal for an eight and a half acre project on Mystic Ave.

306
00:28:04,167 --> 00:28:07,628
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's 278 to 326 Mystic Ave.

307
00:28:08,329 --> 00:28:10,889
[SPEAKER_00]: So big space, big project.

308
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:14,591
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're having one in person.

309
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:17,772
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like an open house style on Monday, September 12th at 6 p.m.

310
00:28:19,352 --> 00:28:22,553
[SPEAKER_00]: at 278 Mystic Ave, so Bank of America building.

311
00:28:23,113 --> 00:28:28,114
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they're having another one over Zoom on Wednesday, September 14th at 5 p.m.

312
00:28:28,655 --> 00:28:32,175
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll send these to you guys over email as well.

313
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:38,137
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no obligation to attend, but in case there's any interest or curiosity, just wanted to let you guys know.

314
00:28:39,954 --> 00:28:40,715
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's all I've got.

315
00:28:41,536 --> 00:28:42,397
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, Amanda.

316
00:28:42,998 --> 00:28:46,563
[SPEAKER_03]: Those sound like things that won't be in October those will be later.

317
00:28:47,364 --> 00:28:48,606
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, for us.

318
00:28:50,028 --> 00:28:51,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, that sound that way.

319
00:28:52,451 --> 00:28:57,417
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, little of interest to the board things, please.

320
00:28:59,051 --> 00:29:07,137
[SPEAKER_04]: One is that the city is reviewing and doing outreach on our waste services, trash, recycling, compost, et cetera.

321
00:29:08,318 --> 00:29:10,119
[SPEAKER_04]: Our waste contract is up for renewal.

322
00:29:10,639 --> 00:29:23,609
[SPEAKER_04]: And right now there is a survey out and it is available for, there's a residential survey, there's a business owner survey, and the residential survey is available in Spanish, Portuguese,

323
00:29:24,524 --> 00:29:30,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Haitian, Creole, and Arabic, and I just put a link in the chat to the press release that has links to all of those.

324
00:29:30,853 --> 00:29:39,405
[SPEAKER_04]: I encourage everybody to fill out the survey, tell us what you think about weight services, what you want, what you don't want, what do you want to see changed, this is the time to change it.

325
00:29:41,301 --> 00:29:42,522
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just helpful.

326
00:29:43,342 --> 00:29:45,883
[SPEAKER_04]: We are putting that out there for businesses as well.

327
00:29:45,903 --> 00:29:54,467
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you wanna flip through it, because when you guys as a board look at things, you're thinking about businesses, but it's really thinking about small businesses.

328
00:29:54,487 --> 00:30:02,290
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we're not gonna suddenly provide waste services to massive life science buildings, right?

329
00:30:02,951 --> 00:30:05,632
[SPEAKER_04]: But we do provide them to a lot of our little businesses.

330
00:30:06,786 --> 00:30:11,569
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyhow, I just want to let make sure you all are aware we're doing that as residents tell your friends please.

331
00:30:12,629 --> 00:30:16,251
[SPEAKER_04]: The other is that as Amanda kind of jogged in my head.

332
00:30:16,271 --> 00:30:21,714
[SPEAKER_04]: I might as well put on your calendars, October 15 is the harvester energy festival.

333
00:30:22,235 --> 00:30:29,418
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an annual event that my office runs that the wind turbine it's noon to three, we have music.

334
00:30:30,941 --> 00:30:33,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it looks like we're gonna have chapters coffee, so we'll have food.

335
00:30:33,723 --> 00:30:38,025
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the hardest thing to get, but there's all kinds of like exhibitors we're gonna have.

336
00:30:38,085 --> 00:30:42,408
[SPEAKER_04]: I just saw that the electrical shop at the vocational school is gonna have a table.

337
00:30:42,848 --> 00:30:53,834
[SPEAKER_04]: We have businesses that we work with around composting and energy aggregation and solar companies and banks show up and basically all kinds.

338
00:30:53,854 --> 00:30:57,376
[SPEAKER_04]: If you know anybody you think who should be exhibiting at it, let us know.

339
00:30:59,164 --> 00:31:07,827
[SPEAKER_04]: not a volunteer, a person who, sorry, it's hard to call an adult who is a resident who I'm paying to do work an intern.

340
00:31:09,087 --> 00:31:21,312
[SPEAKER_04]: So she used to be a volunteer and we hired her to organize the festival this year because my intern quit in the middle of the summer and I needed somebody who could jump in in the middle of the summer.

341
00:31:22,715 --> 00:31:26,258
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so, but anyhow, just want to make sure you guys were all aware of the festival.

342
00:31:26,298 --> 00:31:26,978
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a great time.

343
00:31:27,379 --> 00:31:27,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Come out.

344
00:31:27,739 --> 00:31:28,600
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and we'll have music.

345
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:30,081
[SPEAKER_04]: Did I say that you did?

346
00:31:30,521 --> 00:31:31,862
[SPEAKER_03]: It's always worth saying twice.

347
00:31:33,003 --> 00:31:36,626
[SPEAKER_04]: Matt Heaton and the, um, plays children's music.

348
00:31:36,726 --> 00:31:41,510
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we have a like folksy bluegrass group called trail mix that is played.

349
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:43,371
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to say the last eight years.

350
00:31:43,451 --> 00:31:47,355
[SPEAKER_04]: And they actually reached out to us and they're like, Hey, is the festival on, can we come play?

351
00:31:48,075 --> 00:31:49,837
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll have them again.

352
00:31:50,517 --> 00:31:50,897
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.

353
00:31:51,378 --> 00:31:51,538
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

354
00:31:55,449 --> 00:31:58,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Any other items, Amanda, you got everything off your agenda there.

355
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:00,151
[SPEAKER_04]: I did.

356
00:32:00,671 --> 00:32:00,991
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

357
00:32:02,312 --> 00:32:05,473
[SPEAKER_03]: Other board members any other notes to share.

358
00:32:06,354 --> 00:32:07,034
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone looking good.

359
00:32:09,305 --> 00:32:09,986
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, excellent.

360
00:32:10,927 --> 00:32:29,284
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there, you know what I feel like I should tell you this because you might, if anybody pays attention to it going on the city council agenda for this Tuesday is to create a position that doesn't exist in the city, a senior planner that would work in our office, and actually with Amanda's.

361
00:32:30,705 --> 00:32:54,079
[SPEAKER_04]: uh approval that position would um support the community development board and would support the development work in the city um and so that would free up amanda to do more of the work in our office that uh the parks work in the composting and the environmental work that she's been working on so we're going to post that we're gonna um

362
00:32:54,799 --> 00:33:03,627
[SPEAKER_04]: We're asking the City Council because that job doesn't actually exist, but we have a job opening that we haven't filled all year, the staff planner position.

363
00:33:03,828 --> 00:33:18,201
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of you may remember that we've been looking for a staff planner, so we're going to replace the staff planner with a senior planner instead, and we took down the staff planner when we decided to go to Council for a senior planner position.

364
00:33:19,278 --> 00:33:19,959
[SPEAKER_04]: in the office.

365
00:33:20,479 --> 00:33:25,525
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just wanted to give you guys a heads up, because then we will very quickly post that position.

366
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:30,230
[SPEAKER_04]: And you may, if you looked at it, you'd say, Oh, my God, that sounds like what Amanda does with us.

367
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:31,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, she knows that.

368
00:33:31,952 --> 00:33:36,597
[SPEAKER_04]: And it would be working with this board.

369
00:33:37,638 --> 00:33:39,900
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

370
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:40,301
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

371
00:33:41,136 --> 00:33:44,799
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we certainly appreciate Amanda working with us.

372
00:33:44,919 --> 00:33:52,384
[SPEAKER_04]: We're also going to be posting a housing planner position and a full-time community preservation coordinator position.

373
00:33:53,805 --> 00:33:57,488
[SPEAKER_04]: Those have both been part-time positions in our office and we're making them both full-time.

374
00:33:58,229 --> 00:34:00,290
[SPEAKER_04]: That should happen in the next two weeks.

375
00:34:02,412 --> 00:34:03,032
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good to know.

376
00:34:05,754 --> 00:34:06,635
