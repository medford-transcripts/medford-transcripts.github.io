    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=580.436s">had</a>  a preliminary budget meeting where we've started talking about the school committee budget from an enrollment projection standpoint and from a funding revenue sources perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=592.327s">So</a>  that has already happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=593.968s">We</a>  have a meeting tomorrow night where we will hear from our finance office and the superintendent about their recommended budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=601.895s">And</a>  our budget hearing will be held on Monday, <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=605.758s">4th.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=606.038s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=607.599s">My</a>  days are running together, but we will have a budget hearing on the 24th, and we will either take action to send that to the mayor that evening or in a subsequent meeting the first week of April. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=619.442s">So</a>  we are slightly off what our intended target was, and we discussed that back in January, but we had to make way for the <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=627.985s">the</a>  budgeting process for the supplemental budget for FY 25. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=630.687s">So</a>  that sort of took priority in January. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=632.829s">We'll</a>  be back on track after that and be ready to submit to the mayor our request to the municipality in early April.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=642.497s">Is</a>  that member Reinfeld? <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=645.659s">Nope.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=646.42s">Is</a>  there, are you, have you requested? <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=647.621s">For</a>  some reason, mic five has a request on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=652.905s">All</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=655.387s">Great.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bob Dickinson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=669.39s">I'm</a>  hoping all the technology actually works. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=683.53s">I</a>  know this from Nantucket Town meetings when people have the microphone here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=687.332s">It's</a>  like, no, pretend you're Mick Jagger. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=690.033s">So</a>  I'm trying to share my screen. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=696.276s">Is</a>  that working? <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=705.84s">Share.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=706.32s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=712.675s">If</a>  I can actually make all the rest of this stuff go away. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=722.199s">Financial</a>  update. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=723.3s">All</a>  right, this is the mandated finance department update for fiscal, what's been going on in fiscal 2025, throughout the new estimates for <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=740.43s">Our</a>  budgeting purposes for fiscal 2026 will go through the levy limit local receipts, cherry sheets, other revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=750.878s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=760.426s">My</a>  audio and video are off for Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=768.221s">And</a>  I have an echo so I can start playing Pink Floyd songs.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=776.288s">A</a>  low tech solution will</p>

    <p>[Bob Dickinson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=796.3s">see</a>  if he's got a thick book in there or something. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=825.663s">Checking</a>  1, 2, 3. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=836.289s">Everybody</a>  can hear me now without the. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=842.069s">technical</a>  difficulties. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=844.71s">I</a>  just got back from the annual Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=847.811s">Municipal</a>  Auditors and Accountants Association spring training. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=852.652s">So</a>  I got in a car at about 1.30 and drove from Amherst to here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=859.634s">So</a>  I wasn't able to get here early enough to make sure all this works. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=864.876s">They're</a>  a lively bunch, the auditors and accountants. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=879.633s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=881.034s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=882.034s">So</a>  again, the update for 2025, the update revenue estimates for 2026 go through the levy limit, local receipts, cherry sheets, other revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=898.061s">And</a>  what we think, what our projection right now is for what might be available for the budget for fiscal 2026. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=908.986s">and</a>  various side notes on explaining how we got to these numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=918.453s">And</a>  of course, the caveat on all of this is that these numbers change. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=925.219s">Unfortunately,</a>  I don't have a crystal ball, and I can't look into the future and see exactly how much we'll have. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=933.966s">Various</a>  things that change, well, we can go through them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=938.718s">All</a>  right, for the finance department, we finished the state reporting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=943.839s">The</a>  fiscal 24 books are closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=948.881s">The</a>  24 audit, actually, we should have that in hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=953.982s">I</a>  didn't change that on the slide, but we should have that in hand probably by Monday morning, and it will be submitted. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=962.304s">Also,</a>  the single audit will all be done well before the end of March. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=968.813s">So</a>  pre-cash retained earnings were certified. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=974.236s">Pre-cash</a>  as of June 30, 2024 is $28,343,997. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=976.457s">Retained</a>  earnings for Water Sewer Enterprise is $12,653,475. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=994.332s">Last</a>  year, we had $34 million in free cash, roughly. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=999.655s">But</a>  we used $14 million of it to fund the stabilization funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1006.098s">And</a>  then we had about $1 million in turnbacks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1009.86s">And</a>  we had $6.2 million in excess local receipts, which is why we were able to take 34, drop it to 20, and then come back to $28 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1026.237s">Sure.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1034.185s">Member</a>  Ruseau? <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1035.126s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1035.987s">Could</a>  you tell us what turnbacks are?</p>

    <p>[Bob Dickinson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1039.656s">When</a>  a department doesn't spend its whole budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1043.42s">I</a>  mean, that's where free cash comes from. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1045.442s">You</a>  estimate your revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1047.204s">If</a>  you get more revenue, obviously you'll make more, you know, you'll have more free cash, but also in situations, for instance, police and fire will frequently have budgeted positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1060.098s">but</a>  they're unable to be filled because there simply aren't policemen and firemen out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1065.482s">So</a>  that can be a significant source of a turn back. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1070.286s">We</a>  just didn't spend the whole budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1072.628s">So</a>  on the recap, the budget, your appropriations have to match what you're taking in. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1079.934s">So</a>  if you spend less than the appropriation, then that goes to free cash.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1086.619s">Councilor</a>  Lazzaro.</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1088.542s">Very</a>  quick question. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1089.363s">Can</a>  you send us this presentation after the meeting?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1093.826s">What?</a> </p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1094.207s">Can</a>  you send this presentation to us after the meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1095.828s">Oh,</a>  yes, of course. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1096.168s">Thank</a>  you so much.</p>

    <p>[Bob Dickinson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1098.55s">All</a>  righty.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1098.89s">I</a>  just had one question, Bob. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1101.232s">Are</a>  you going to go into what the excess local receipts were?</p>

    <p>[Bob Dickinson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1104.575s">I</a>  wasn't planning to do details on that, but I can. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1111.412s">I</a>  can easily send the council exactly what happened.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1115.755s">That</a>  would be helpful.</p>

    <p>[Bob Dickinson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1116.535s">I</a>  know one big part of it, which I'll touch on further on in the presentation, was because interest rates remained high, and our treasurer did a lot of work to make sure that we were, while keeping cash on hand to pay payroll and stuff like that, that everything else was invested in higher interest rate <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1139.502s">you</a>  know, vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1142.523s">And</a>  we still had a whole bunch of unspent ARPA money. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1146.604s">So</a>  if you have an extra $20 million in ARPA money that has been allocated but hasn't yet been spent, it's sitting on our bank account. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1154.446s">And</a>  that is general fund revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1157.327s">So</a>  that's a nice one there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1160.088s">I'll</a>  say this again later, but I do not expect for local receipts next year, which is where investment income comes into the picture, I don't expect what we're going to be getting in interest next year to be anywhere near what we got in fiscal 2024. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1174.917s">But</a>  I can definitely go through the numbers and show exactly where all this money came from.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1182.461s">Yeah,</a>  I think especially hearing that that's coming from interest on cash on hand or interest on investments, <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1190.4s">just</a>  knowing how much of that 6 million was from interest on cash we don't expect to have in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1195.242s">I'm</a>  just wondering how that excess local receipts affects our baseline revenue estimates for fiscal 26 essentially.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1202.424s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1203.585s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1206.726s">All</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1207.686s">Mr.</a>  President, I have a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1212.642s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1212.922s">I</a>  apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1213.623s">I</a>  just didn't really know if you knew my standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1216.325s">I</a>  just have to, just for clarification purposes and move forward, just to say again, Bob, we're at $28 million again in free cash?</p>

    <p>[Bob Dickinson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1225.372s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1226.072s">That's</a>  what we have today, $28 million again.</p>

    <p>[Bob Dickinson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1229.635s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1231.216s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1233.738s">Straight</a>  from the Bureau of Accounts, that's what they say we've got. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1237.581s">So</a>  there we are.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1239.142s">And</a>  just to clarify, so essentially, <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1241.487s">The</a>  balance was 34 million last at the end of 2020 on 630 23, but we appropriated 14 million so that's a minus 14 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1252.559s">And</a>  then there was a turn back so under spending of a million, and then an unexpected. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1259.262s">over</a>  overage and local receipts of 6 million and a big portion of that was from interest that we hadn't expected to earn because interest rates were high, right.</p>

    <p>[Bob Dickinson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1269.416s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1271.279s">Then</a>  the other, the other thing that would add into. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1275.664s">into</a>  free cash is obviously, you know, we have accounts receivable for tax billings and personal property tax, but that doesn't mean we're going to get it all in this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1288.868s">It</a>  usually is around the same amount that we actually billed out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1294.029s">But</a>  if, for instance, if in one year people <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1298.957s">in</a>  arrears, your accounts receivable goes down when they pay you off, but your receipts for that year are larger. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1308.264s">Does</a>  that make any sense? <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1311.807s">I'm</a>  getting into the weeds on the tax recap and how the city is funded.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1317.151s">Yeah,</a>  I just wanted to clarify. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1319.762s">sometimes</a>  people we didn't have $28 million of new money that was Oh, no, you know, it's a balance. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1326.005s">We</a>  actually the free cash balance decreased by $6 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1328.867s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1330.408s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bob Dickinson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1336.428s">2025</a>  general fund budget was $189,407,845. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1338.489s">Medford</a>  Public Schools received $83 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1344.972s">And</a>  we keep an eye on all the budgets. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1352.075s">We</a>  also, especially Medford Public Schools, we make sure that when we're getting into the end of the year that <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1359.639s">nobody's</a>  gonna be over budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1361.94s">And</a>  that usually means me working with Noel and Jeremy Q to make sure that all of the funds that might come in from grant money, those positions have actually, we've actually charged everything to the right places. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1380.453s">And</a>  there are some year end transfers that happen that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1382.835s">But</a>  right now we expect everything to be fine for the Medford public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1390.895s">Revenue</a>  estimates. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1392.695s">I'll</a>  go over this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1394.816s">I</a>  would imagine everybody here probably has a basic understanding of how we make these revenue estimates, but just to go over it again, Proposition 2 1⁄2, you take last year's levy limit, you multiply it by 1.025, and that's your levy limit for the next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1419.123s">Once</a>  you've done that, you add in certified new growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1424.045s">This</a>  is another, the levy limit itself is based on the prior year's levy limit. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1429.307s">We</a>  know what that's going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1431.188s">Certified</a>  new growth is whatever the assessors can come up with to add to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1437.33s">So</a>  right now that is just an estimate, but it includes all sorts of basic things. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1442.952s">If</a>  you have a lot, you subdivide it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1445.735s">Now</a>  you have two lots, it's worth more than it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1449.159s">So</a>  that's certified new growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1451.862s">And</a>  things as little, you know, if you have a house and you put on an addition, there's a bathroom, that's new growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1464.017s">levy</a>  limit that's self-explanatory. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1466.318s">You</a>  put them together, and that's what you can levy. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1469.479s">And</a>  we also have to estimate state aid, cherry sheets, Chapter 70, school aid, veterans benefits, charter school money. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1483.403s">And</a>  when we're doing that, we're doing the net of what the state aid will be and what the state assessments will be. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1494.226s">We</a>  can go into that in a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1495.567s">So</a>  fiscal year 2025, levy limit is 153,506,550. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1501.07s">Proposition</a>  2.5 increase is $3,837,663.75. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1501.79s">I</a>  doubt we'll be able to capture the $0.75, just mathematically. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1518.878s">But</a>  it shouldn't be too hard to deal with. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1522.999s">Our</a>  current new growth estimate from Jared, our assessor, is $2.2 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1527.06s">So</a>  our new capacity estimate is $159,544,213.75. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1529.74s">Local</a>  receipt. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1530.38s">Did</a>  I not change this? <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1546.978s">Oh,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1547.961s">For</a>  fiscal 2025, local receipts were estimated at $21,124,900. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1555.892s">This</a>  year, we're estimating them at $2,500,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1562.635s">Local</a>  receipts, the big ones are motor vehicle excise, $7 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1567.698s">I'm</a>  expecting that to be relatively flat. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1570.759s">It</a>  increased a lot after the pandemic when people couldn't get cars or didn't want to buy a new car. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1577.162s">But</a>  now people have bought a lot of their new cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1580.744s">And</a>  every year, you have a car. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1583.225s">your</a>  motor vehicle excise goes down. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1585.286s">So</a>  unless people rush out and buy a whole bunch of new cars, I'm expecting that to be pretty much flat. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1592.551s">Hotel</a>  and meals taxes, those have been increasing slightly every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1597.974s">So</a>  we're <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1599.115s">We're</a>  going to go up a little bit on that one. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1602.436s">Building</a>  permits, again, that's another one. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1605.476s">Hopefully,</a>  people are building stuff, especially because if you get a building permit, that's one way the assessor figures out what new growth is going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1615.218s">He</a>  gets all the building permits and goes to the houses and says, hey, you just put an addition on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1621.38s">So</a>  your assessment goes up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1623.992s">And</a>  then, as I said, investment income, $2.5 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1628.937s">I</a>  expect that's going to be less this year because of all the money that we've actually spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1639.247s">Anyway,</a>  local receipts for 2026, I'm estimating $21,500,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1640.989s">Local</a>  receipts is one of those things that you <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1650.701s">It</a>  can vary a lot depending on economic conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1655.363s">So</a>  people in my position ordinarily try to make sure that we're doing a pretty conservative estimate of what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1665.547s">If</a>  you don't, and you get to recap time, the Department of Revenue can look at your actuals for the year and say, you're not going to make your revenue targets. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1679.873s">And</a>  that means having to vote a whole new budget, because the appropriations have to meet the revenues. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1688.637s">So</a>  that's one place in the recap that we tend to be <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1692.939s">reasonably</a>  conservative I try to make it as close as I can, but I'm not. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1701.029s">I</a>  will never sit there and say, OK, we made this much last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1704.431s">Now</a>  we're going to make more this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1705.792s">I</a>  will never expect to make more than we did in the last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1709.533s">I</a>  usually put it in to be less, just to be conservative, to make sure that if something actually happens in the economy, that we won't miss our revenue targets and then have to revote the whole budget based on the new numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1727.942s">Cherry</a>  sheets. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1730.977s">initial</a>  proposal from the governor, which is the one that we use it again, it tends to be the most conservative estimate of what we're going to get. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1738.885s">Usually</a>  it's a little bit more, but that's not always the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1744.171s">So</a>  estimated receipts, 35 million charges. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1750.537s">is</a>  close to $13 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1753.818s">So</a>  the net cherry sheet revenue should be $22,358,418, according to the governor's current proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1763.001s">If</a>  you don't know, cherry sheets go through the governor, and the House votes on what they think they should be, and the Senate votes on what they think <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1771.564s">they</a>  should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1772.124s">And</a>  then we get the final numbers when everybody gets together and makes a deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1777.826s">So</a>  we had three more iterations of what cherry sheet receipts might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1783.367s">So</a>  that's another place where there's significant uncertainty about what we might actually end up with at the end of the year.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1801.707s">planning</a>  purposes for the cherry sheet, FY26 net cherry sheet?</p>

    <p>[Bob Dickinson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1808.059s">No,</a>  sorry, that's a typo. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1809.481s">That</a>  would have been the 2025 net cherry sheet, I believe.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1813.121s">OK,</a>  so the 22-3 is what you're estimating for cherry sheet? <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1816.942s">Yes,</a>  that's what I'm estimating. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1817.642s">OK,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Bob Dickinson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1818.463s">If</a>  you want, I have the, it's easy enough to get on the DOR website what cherry sheet numbers for the last 10, 15 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1829.926s">I</a>  actually have a spreadsheet. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1831.006s">When</a>  I'm doing the spreadsheet to put together the recap, I actually have the exact numbers from the last several years so I can make a prediction on where they're going.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1845.477s">a</a>  reduction in cherry sheets as you do your budget planning, or are you?</p>

    <p>[Bob Dickinson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1850.06s">At</a>  this point, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1851.08s">I'm</a>  using the governor's initial cherry sheet proposal is already out on the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1860.365s">So</a>  we just go with that number, because usually it's right around there, if not a little bit more.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1866.529s">OK,</a>  perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1867.329s">I</a>  just wanted to clarify. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1868.35s">Things</a>  are wild right now, so thanks.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1873.314s">Thank</a>  you, any questions from the public on that? <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1874.895s">No,</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1877.277s">Go</a>  ahead, Bob.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1878.118s">I</a>  can just comment, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1878.919s">I</a>  think most cities and towns use the governor's proposal, because that's all we really have in the House and then the Senate and then joint conference. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1885.984s">If</a>  anything changes, we're going to have to adjust. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1888.086s">Hopefully,</a>  we just stop and knock down and spend some time in the state house yesterday. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1893.37s">So</a>  they are watching what's going on federally and are going to adjust accordingly, depending on if and when. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1898.654s">So</a>  we're going to keep track of it as much as we can.</p>

    <p>[Bob Dickinson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1905.638s">Alrighty,</a>  so other revenue that the city receives casino mitigation funds, funds, these are transfers into the general fund to fund positions casino mitigation funds three positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1922.074s">We</a>  get money in from the sales of cemetery lots and the perpetual care trust fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1929.738s">So</a>  every year the treasurer sends us what the available revenue is from the trust. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1938.302s">from</a>  the interest on the trust. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1940.965s">And</a>  that gets added to the budget as a transfer in from the trust fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1945.611s">Then</a>  there's indirect costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1948.154s">Water</a>  and sewer enterprise fund is assessed for expenses budgeted in the general fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1953.86s">AP</a>  payroll, processing, healthcare, we have to, that's another number that we have to pay a lot of attention to, to make sure that we've got good estimates of what that might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1969.468s">We</a>  don't at this time, we've been told that health insurance is going up by probably 10%, but we do not at this time I believe have the actual final numbers on what our health insurance costs are going to be next year that can could change at the MMA concert conference that I was just at. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1991.367s">Some</a>  communities are seeing increases of as much as 20% in their healthcare costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=1998.69s">There</a>  are many communities that are experiencing 12, 15%. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2003.992s">And</a>  when you multiply 20% by what we're paying right now, which is $25 million or something like that, that eats up a lot of your budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2013.895s">So</a>  that's something we're working on very closely and definitely keeping an eye on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2022.9s">So</a>  this is pretty much the summary, if you can all see it without the caption. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2037.939s">So</a>  you can see the breakdown of all these numbers, the 2025 levy limit 153 million times 2.5 plus the new growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2043.267s">Gives</a>  us the 159 million for property taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2054.717s">That</a>  flows to the next section. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2056.758s">So</a>  we're saying 21.5 for local receipts, state aid, 35 million, indirect costs, sales of lots, et cetera, 218 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2070.744s">Then</a>  below that, we have non-budgeted expenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2074.186s">These</a>  appear on the recap page two. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2077.913s">They're</a>  non budgeted, and they are the things like the cherry sheet assessments, which are going to be 12, which we're putting in the governor's numbers again that's the breakdown of this net is $12.8 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2094.414s">tax</a>  title. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2095.114s">It's</a>  a small amount, but that allows the treasurer to do the legal work for properties where the homeowner has not paid their taxes in a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2108.879s">Snow</a>  and ice deficit last year, it wasn't anywhere near that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2113.64s">I</a>  think it was $400,000, but <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2117.383s">We</a>  know we've had a little bit of snow this winter, so that's a legal deficit that you can put on the books. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2124.224s">Right</a>  now, the estimate is $750,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2126.925s">Hopefully,</a>  with the warm weather, we won't be experiencing another huge snowstorm, knock on wood. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2133.566s">But</a>  right now, that's what it looks like. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2135.066s">Our</a>  snow and ice deficit will be. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2137.187s">That</a>  has to be raised on the recap. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2140.447s">And</a>  then every year, it's good to put <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2145.979s">It's</a>  good to keep a close eye on your overlay. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2151.175s">This</a>  is the money that funds tax abatements. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2154.138s">So</a>  I work with the assessor to see what's out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2158.581s">And</a>  we total up how much money we actually have in overlay. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2162.565s">And</a>  we put in what we think we might need in case things go against us. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2169.191s">And</a>  we have to, I think right now there are a couple of large projects where <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2176.597s">you</a>  know, lawyers are involved and they want a big abatement. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2179.922s">So</a>  that's something that I work with the assessor to make sure I have a good number and we've put enough money into the overlay so that we have enough money to pay these if we need to. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2194.81s">And</a>  that gives you the bottom line. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2196.231s">It's</a>  roughly a little less than $205 million that we have available to spend at this point in time, as far as I know. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2207.178s">Again,</a>  if you know where I could get a crystal ball so I can do this better, that would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2211.82s">Is</a>  this making sense to everyone?</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2216.823s">Is</a>  that all of the, oh, looks like Paul wants to.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2222.807s">Yep,</a>  you have some more slides too, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2225.971s">Member</a>  Ruseau.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2226.992s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2228.493s">I</a>  just, the state assessments, I did look it up and just shy of 8 million of that is actually charter tuition. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2236.719s">Just</a>  wanted to point that out, not for you, you know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2240.922s">And</a>  Councilor Leming has his hand up.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2245.546s">Member</a>  Ruseau just made the point that 8 million of the state assessments is for charter schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2252.411s">And</a>  go ahead Matt, Councilor Leming.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2255.685s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2257.806s">I</a>  understand that this could be outside the purview of the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2262.488s">It</a>  could be like tied up in grants and stuff like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2266.671s">But</a>  Mr. Dinkinson, is there a way to get sort of a year by year number of the amount of money that the city receives from the federal government? <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2281.638s">Or</a>  are those statistics or trends handy anywhere?</p>

    <p>[Bob Dickinson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2289.391s">Right</a>  now, we're keeping a close eye on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2293.612s">I'm</a>  trying to formulate a list of all the monies that we get from the federal government. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2299.094s">I</a>  don't have an exact figure for that at this point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2306.456s">But</a>  I could probably get this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2308.977s">The</a>  single audit would have all the big numbers for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2316.52s">I</a>  could look into putting that together.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2317.981s">And</a>  I can add to that it's been a project we've been working on since January to try to pull the numbers from every department. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2328.21s">We</a>  just recently gave everything to finance to kind of tidy up so we can get you a copy of what's currently we're receiving in federal funding a lot of that is recurring but of course there's some that are that are grants that are one time or over several year period but I think it would be a huge endeavor to <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2343.764s">go</a>  back years, but I think we can definitely get you a snapshot of what we're looking at now within the next several weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2349.31s">I</a>  know the finance department's been working on trying to get that together in a readable format for us to just keep an eye on as these are such uncertain times.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2362.821s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2364.383s">Even,</a>  even just a ballpark estimate of previous years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2369.609s">And</a>  this year, if you have it I understand it could be irresponsible to offer that now but any information is appreciated. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2377.638s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2380.181s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2384.423s">Um,</a>  do you have an estimate? <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2388.704s">Or</a>  my own education because I can't remember the new growth in prior years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2392.785s">Is</a>  this average amount or a smaller amount or larger amount?</p>

    <p>[Bob Dickinson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2397.046s">It</a>  seems small to me, but well, uh, new growth really depends on the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2405.108s">It</a>  also quite frankly, depends on staffing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2407.969s">If,</a>  um <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2410.317s">Because</a>  in order to assess new growth, you have to actually physically go to the property and say, look, you've got an addition. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2421.084s">Our</a>  previous assessor worked very hard on making sure we got those numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2426.007s">And</a>  we're definitely keeping up with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2430.662s">But</a>  it can vary a lot per year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2432.643s">It's</a>  straight on the recap. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2434.384s">So</a>  if you want how much we got for the last 10 years, I can put that together really quite quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2441.808s">You</a>  can just go into gateway and this is what it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2446.87s">It's</a>  certified by the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2449.111s">So</a>  once the state says you can put in this number, that's what you can put in.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2455.237s">And</a>  I can just add, we did look into that last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2457.539s">I</a>  think we looked back about 20 years and there's only been three years where it's been over 2 million and that's been in the last four or five. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2465.747s">Okay,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2466.588s">That's</a>  helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2467.088s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2467.308s">I</a>  appreciate that.</p>

    <p>[Nina Nazarian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2476.678s">that</a>  network? <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2477.339s">Okay,</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2478.079s">I</a>  was going to add what the mayor added, but also will add that as Bob stated, as finance director Dickinson stated, this is a particularly challenging year because we have transitioned and we have a new chief assessor, Jared Yazian, has become the chief assessor, which we're very excited about. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2494.935s">We</a>  are working towards hiring the assistant assessor, but we're also in a reevaluation year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2501.12s">So</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2502.902s">It's</a>  a significant amount of work and we have a vacancy. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2505.684s">So</a>  just to kind of compliment, but we've been in the ballpark of $2.5 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2511.087s">This</a>  year, we're just being mindful that there are elements that are a little bit beyond our control despite how hard we've been trying to move that wheel. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2520.873s">So</a>  anyway, thank you.</p>

    <p>[Bob Dickinson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2532.792s">Moving</a>  along. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2536.134s">So</a>  as in previous years, the assistant finance director, chief of staff, and mayor have been in correspondence with all of the department heads about the fiscal 26 preliminary numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2551.064s">And</a>  the assistant finance director really does go through these budgets with a fine-toothed cone to make sure that, you know, to make sure that <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2564.054s">any</a>  unspent categories from prior years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2568.838s">We</a>  look at them, we make sure that that is in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2573.521s">Again,</a>  there's things like police salaries, for instance. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2579.086s">We</a>  may have positions available in police and fire salaries that can't be filled, but we still have to be cognizant of the fact that we might be able to fill them, so we have to have the budget there in case we can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2593.485s">So</a>  getting the people for the unfilled positions is important. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2600.49s">This</a>  will be, obviously, this work is ongoing until the final budget is submitted to the council, which should be at the end of May. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2610.277s">So,</a>  and yeah, I guess our deadline is Friday, May 30th, to get all this stuff in front of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2626.283s">Back</a>  to health insurance, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2629.285s">The</a>  fiscal 2025 budget was $28 million, so now we're over $31 million estimated in health insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2639.773s">That's</a>  significant. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2640.854s">If</a>  you think about how we raise revenue, the big one is Prop 2.5 and new growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2647.739s">If</a>  we can get 2.5%, we know we can get, and then new growth <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2655.74s">Historically</a>  it's been on the average since I've been here on the average of three and a half to 4% total that our levy limit has gone up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2664.422s">So</a>  if you have a significant part of your budget that is going up 10% and historically the amount you get from your tax levy goes up around 4%. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2678.184s">That's</a>  a big gaping hole in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2681.285s">It's</a>  going to be difficult to weather that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2685.105s">And</a>  hopefully, in subsequent years, it won't be going up that much. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2690.786s">But</a>  that's one thing we're working very hard to figure out how to resolve. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2698.388s">Workers'</a>  compensation for this year, it's on target, except workers' compensation, the problem with <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2705.95s">trying</a>  to estimate that as we'll have workers who have been out because of injuries for a long time, and they will, the HR department and legal will be working on making, you know, saying, okay, if we give you this much, have we settled this claim? <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2722.795s">We</a>  had a very large settlement in July. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2725.595s">It</a>  was $165,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2727.756s">So</a>  at that point, that's probably going to be over budget by the time we get to the end of the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2737.733s">pension</a>  obligations. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2740.456s">I'm</a>  on the retirement board and we have the current schedule that we have keeps the increase that we have to pay every year to around three and a half to 4%, which is very good because it keeps up, like I said before, <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2759.697s">If</a>  your tax revenue is going up by roughly 4% when you add in the new growth, if you have your pension obligations going up more than that, that's a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2771.762s">This</a>  way, we'll be paying more every year, but hopefully, it will only take up the same portion of the budget that it did last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2782.39s">And</a>  of course, contractual increases. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2785.093s">When</a>  we're putting together the budget, we have to look at what the contracts say. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2789.437s">That's</a>  non-negotiable. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2790.618s">We</a>  signed a contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2791.779s">So</a>  if it says that in July 1st, everybody in the clerical union gets another 2.5%, well, that's gonna go up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2801.848s">So</a>  those are the main things that we look at very closely when we're doing the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2809.593s">Revenue</a>  adjustments, increased local receipts. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2812.915s">By</a>  a little bit, it's conservative. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2815.016s">Again,</a>  I have to be able to, I can't go out on a limb on this without having the DOR call me and say, hey, Bob, do you really think you're gonna make that much more money? <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2824.88s">So</a>  I keep them conservative. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2829.302s">I</a>  think right now we're at, <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2832.578s">Um,</a>  putting 400,000 into overlay for 2026. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2836.383s">That</a>  was an adjustment. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2839.706s">We</a>  think we can weather that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2841.108s">That</a>  probably gives us a nice enough cushion in the overlay so we can pay for any large abatements we might have to pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2848.196s">And</a>  that's also... <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2852.441s">It's</a>  an adjustable number in the recap, but when my snow and ice just jumped by $350,000, I'm like, okay, well, maybe we can drop this by a little. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2864.226s">Again,</a>  this is just an illustration of how, when you're putting the budget together, there's a lot of moving pieces to it, and a lot of them can change. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2874.588s">So</a>  I did change that number. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2877.29s">The</a>  latest new growth estimate is $2.2 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2882.494s">This</a>  is another kind of complicated accounting detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2888.698s">Some</a>  projects that are not finished or some nonprofit organizations don't pay property taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2896.144s">They</a>  pay what's known as pilot or payments in lieu of taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2900.747s">Now,</a>  there's a development through the Mystic Valley Development Corporation that will be moving off of pilot payments. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2911.175s">They've</a>  been paying us pilot payments for, I think, 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2916.597s">That's</a>  gonna be part of the $2.2 million that we're expecting in new growth, because we will now put them on the tax rolls, which is good because then every year we can add that to our levy. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2926.961s">But</a>  those pilot payments won't be as large anymore because that was a significant chunk of what we were getting in pilot payments. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2935.365s">So</a>  that's part of local receipts. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2938.186s">So</a>  that's why I try to be conservative with local receipts.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2942.339s">I</a>  just had one question on that, Bob. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2945.262s">And</a>  I think for folks, this is the essentially the riverside development riverside chest done through the brownfields and right complicated thing are the pilot payments, more than what we will end up receiving <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2959.601s">in</a>  taxes from the properties.</p>

    <p>[Bob Dickinson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2962.083s">We</a>  will get more in taxes than we were getting in pilot payments. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2964.806s">And</a>  that adds to our levy. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2968.149s">So</a>  every year, 2.5% is tacked onto that.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2972.693s">So</a>  it's a net gain, but it's shifting into new growth.</p>

    <p>[Bob Dickinson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2975.335s">It's</a>  just shifting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2976.496s">Yes,</a>  it's shifting into new growth from local receipts. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=2988.954s">And</a>  again, when I started here, when we're reviewing the budgets, we've been very careful to make sure that large capital expenses aren't included. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3004.134s">in</a>  operating budgets. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3006.478s">So</a>  if the DPW, for instance, needs a new truck, we want to keep that separate because we want to keep the operating expenses being things like paper supplies, salt, stuff that is consumable. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3020.297s">In</a>  general, the idea is that if you have an asset that's going to last more than five years, five years or more, that you actually keep it out of the operating budget and you pay for things like that by using free cash or other sources. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3038.132s">And</a>  again, we very closely review all the budgets going back about five years to see if everybody's spending all their money and what they're spending it on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3050.035s">We've</a>  been centralizing the facilities costs and information technology, trying to get the budgets in the right places to make sure that if there's savings or efficiencies we can get from that, that we actually capitalize on those. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3067.319s">That</a>  would be, for instance, making sure that over the years, the IT department has done things like make sure we have one license from Adobe for Adobe Acrobat. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3079.162s">And</a>  different departments didn't go out and get their own license. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3085.443s">So</a>  that way, we can have some savings by consolidating it, and we have a better bargaining position. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3094.285s">And</a>  I think that's all I've got. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3100.347s">I</a>  wish I was better at the technology, quite frankly. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3110.103s">So</a>  yeah, that's a overview. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3112.305s">I</a>  hope I didn't bore anybody too much. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3116.51s">It's</a>  a lot of numbers, and that's really what I do. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3126.802s">Okay,</a>  just enough to give you, and this is really, again, I can't stress enough that this is an ongoing process. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3133.886s">We</a>  worked with department heads, we look at their budgets, we make sure the budgets are the right size to do what is necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3141.89s">When</a>  the budgets, when we work with the department heads to do this, we have, okay, what did you have last year? <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3149.754s">These</a>  are contractual increases for your staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3153.015s">This</a>  is what you spent last year on expenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3156.155s">And</a>  then below that will be, this is stuff that we know. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3160.116s">For</a>  instance, obviously, the GIC, if we see 10% in our health insurance costs, we know that's going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3168.059s">It</a>  could be 9%. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3168.84s">It</a>  could be 11%. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3171.12s">But</a>  we have to put that in there, because we have to pay that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3173.741s">There's</a>  nothing we can do about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3176.623s">Software</a>  increases. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3178.224s">Every</a>  year, the software admins that runs the general ledger, every year they give us an increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3186.871s">We</a>  try to negotiate with them to keep it as small as possible, but that has to be in the finance department budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3192.856s">We</a>  have to pay for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3194.984s">And</a>  then below that, we would have the department head say, OK, if I have another position, it'll cost this much, but that position can do this, that, and the other thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3205.908s">And</a>  that's the departmental wish list. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3209.81s">So</a>  that's essentially what we work on for the next couple of months. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3218.213s">And</a>  then, obviously, I'm updating the revenue estimates pretty much weekly.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3232.927s">Member</a>  Ruseau.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3241.275s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3243.317s">So</a>  if the House and Senate actually ever pass a budget before December 31st, which does happen, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3255.227s">Maybe,</a>  once in a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3258.23s">June</a>  30th, what did I say? <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3260.428s">You</a>  said December 31st. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3261.369s">I</a>  meant June 30.</p>

    <p>[Bob Dickinson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3263.01s">I</a>  don't think they've ever done it before December 31st, so I know those numbers.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3266.873s">Sorry,</a>  I did mean June 30. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3272.297s">All</a>  of our documentation, all of our budget can be done and signed off before they have actually... They've actually finalized the numbers.</p>

    <p>[Bob Dickinson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3279.662s">Yes,</a>  that can happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3280.863s">Good.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3281.263s">I</a>  assume that's what we do in years when they're working in July. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3285.647s">And</a>  when they're working in July and... <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3291.022s">we</a>  get more money. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3292.864s">That</a>  just is that just comes in and it's just excess. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3296.667s">Or</a>  does that go into a specific? <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3298.088s">It</a>  just goes into the general fund.</p>

    <p>[Bob Dickinson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3300.309s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3301.61s">Put</a>  on my long distance goggles. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3305.053s">Um,</a>  that's just general revenue of the city, so it would go to the general fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3310.397s">And,</a>  um, if Everything works out correctly, that falls to free cash for that fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3318.163s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3320.5s">I</a>  can't remember if they actually agreed to it last year or not, but last year there was at least an attempt to have a consensus on the local aid figures before June 30th, even though the final budget hasn't passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3334.654s">I</a>  don't remember if that was just a request that the MMA put out or if they actually managed to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3338.958s">Nina's</a>  shaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3341.04s">I</a>  can't remember either. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3344.331s">that</a>  has been something that they've tried to do in the past to give us a little bit more certainty, or that we've at least asked for. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3350.623s">And</a>  is that you, Erica?</p>

    <p>[Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3353.168s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3355.33s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3356.351s">Thank</a>  you for the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3357.432s">It</a>  was I found it clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3360.054s">I</a>  had to look up a few words, but not too many. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3362.156s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3363.597s">I</a>  have a hyper local local question. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3365.559s">I'm</a>  wondering if on the city side, we're going to see some non standard increases in departments. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3372.705s">My</a>  understanding is some of the city departments <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3377.966s">We're</a>  a little restrained last time in order to fill some gaps in the school budget, which I very much appreciate. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3383.736s">And</a>  I'm wondering if we're going to see those come back of people who <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3389.512s">unevenly</a>  increasing within the city? <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3392.933s">That</a>  might be a question for the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3394.453s">It</a>  might also be premature, but I know some of the departments in the city, I don't wanna say sacrificed, but their ask wasn't as big because we had some significant gaps in the school budget to fill. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3408.996s">And</a>  I know the override covered some of those, but I'm curious what the impact is gonna be on the allocations.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3419.399s">I</a>  can answer that a member member Reinfeld is best I can now Nina, and I, after Courtney has kind of gathered the budgets together Courtney's our budget director, are starting to meet with each department head and understand <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3435.162s">Those</a>  types of scenarios, because it wasn't just last year that we pulled from the city to help better fund the schools I think it's a priority of the Council myself in the schools to fund our in the school committee to make sure our schools are funded properly to make sure our libraries funded properly. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3454.05s">But</a>  having said that, I thank you for asking the question because, yes, we have had tough budget side on the city side with people that were upset because they couldn't do or the things they wanted to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3468.377s">So</a>  we're going to take a hard look and see what can be added while at the same time still trying to prioritize our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3475.18s">We're</a>  very lucky to have that override pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3478.362s">But</a>  I still, even though schools have a number, <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3481.223s">If</a>  there's additional funding which I always try, we always try to do, we want to make sure we meet the needs of the schools that's just important piece of puzzle. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3490.396s">So</a>  yes, it's a balance, and we have 25 departments, and we are going to try to first add back some of the things we had to cut. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3497.926s">and</a>  then see what room there is to maybe grow in a few spots. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3501.967s">And</a>  we always know we can usually add a position or two, and there's a long list of 20 plus positions that are needed within the departments. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3510.509s">But</a>  I think Nina and I have, and our CFO, have a good pulse on how the departments are operating and which ones need to see a little more growth in that 1%, 2%, 3%, and which ones <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3524.872s">can</a>  sustain. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3526.072s">So</a>  it's a work in progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3527.493s">We</a>  hope to finish those meetings by the end of April so that we can prepare and get the council their budget beginning in May, which is I think in the budget ordinance first week in May. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3538.015s">So</a>  it's still a work in progress.</p>

    <p>[Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3539.596s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3540.016s">And</a>  then, of course, there's the outstanding question that I know nobody can answer about what the federal landscape is going to look like and what <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3548.478s">is</a>  going to come or not come to the city, what compensations the states have. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3553.021s">And</a>  of course, we'll be talking with the school finance director about contingencies and what things look like within the school budget, because we get obviously a lot of federal grants and a lot of federal aid and questions around, is this going to be a <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3569.409s">if</a>  we end up, find ourselves with less money, is this going to be an across the board reduction or is it going to be targeted to particular areas if we have to make those decisions, which I very much hope we don't, of course. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3581.292s">But</a>  just recognizing that on the floor.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3585.573s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3585.873s">And</a>  if the state is going to budget conservatively from what I understood from my meetings yesterday, in case they need to plug gaps like Medicaid, which will be in the billions, then <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3598.005s">it's</a>  a guessing game of what the state's gonna cover and what the cities and towns are gonna have to cover. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3602.388s">So</a>  it could be substantial and we're just praying and hoping that it is not.</p>

    <p>[Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3608.773s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3617.559s">Any</a>  questions from members of the council at this time? <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3619.761s">I</a>  have a couple. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3625.825s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3629.165s">Bob,</a>  the pension applications are based on the actuarial schedule, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3635.911s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3636.391s">And</a>  that's fully funded in 2033? <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3637.952s">It's</a>  2033 now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3638.373s">That'll</a>  be a good year.</p>

    <p>[Bob Dickinson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3640.614s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3645.799s">Don't</a>  forget about open. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3647.461s">Yeah,</a>  exactly. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3648.262s">So,</a>  yeah, that's what a lot of cities and towns are doing that they're fully funding the pension obligations are required to be fully funded by 2040. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3659.676s">But</a>  Parag the pension agency would really like them to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3664.522s">that</a>  we should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3665.002s">Funded</a>  much sooner than that, and we're even sooner than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3669.184s">That's</a>  2033 that we should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3672.005s">Um</a>  we should be fully funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3674.967s">And</a>  that the excess. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3678.128s">Off</a>  the top of my head. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3679.148s">I</a>  think that will save the city something like $20 million a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3682.29s">Um</a>  but at that point, we should be funding taking a significant</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3694.095s">And</a>  they're going to come up with some sort of similar program and schedule for that.</p>

    <p>[Bob Dickinson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3698.117s">Yeah,</a>  well, it's not, I don't think it's required yet, but it's a good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3705.262s">So</a>  hopefully once we get all that done, these programs should be self-sustaining.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3713.741s">So</a>  20, 60, 20.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3717.024s">I</a>  doubt I'll actually live to see it, but it's good to keep pushing at it.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3724.589s">The</a>  ACFRS for fiscal 23 and 24, when will those be available? <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3730.834s">The</a>  2023 is on the website right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3732.816s">And</a>  2024, I have to review it tomorrow.</p>

    <p>[Bob Dickinson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3741.274s">I'm</a>  the last person to actually have to review it, but we have it in hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3745.598s">And</a>  once I review it and say, this is great, I sign the transmittal letter and we get the final document and that will go right on the website and be sent out.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3759.429s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3761.17s">It's</a>  the combined financial comprehensive annual comprehensive financial report. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3768.656s">Yeah,</a>  it's the 100 something page document that, yeah, shows all of the annual audits, how everything was calculated, fund balances. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3776.802s">So</a>  actually really helpful read to understand everything the city does.</p>

    <p>[Bob Dickinson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3783.286s">Or</a>  if you have insomnia, it's very useful document.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3786.689s">Keeps</a>  me up at night, I'll tell you that.</p>

    <p>[Bob Dickinson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3788.23s">It</a>  would, wouldn't it?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3792.733s">But</a>  I just think it's useful for people to know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3796.497s">that</a>  document shows essentially down to the dollar, where the money of the city goes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3802.141s">And</a>  it's a level of accounting that most institutions, businesses, and others in this country are not asked to, you know, meet. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3811.688s">So,</a>  you know, even in the nonprofit industry that I'm in, there's, you know, a 2%. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3820.254s">Basically,</a>  if it's 2% off, that's pretty much fine, is the general rule. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3826.362s">Some</a>  organizations choose to go down to the dollar, but cities and towns have to. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3830.445s">It</a>  has to be independently audited every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3832.206s">And</a>  these reports show exactly where every dollar went. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3835.868s">And</a>  I just think that's valuable information for people to understand that those are the standards that municipalities are held to and we meet those standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3843.993s">So</a>  thank you for the work on it.</p>

    <p>[Bob Dickinson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3845.647s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3846.427s">And</a>  again, these are all available on the city's website in the finance department. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3851.328s">Going</a>  back many, many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3853.109s">You</a>  can see where we were in 2019. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3856.289s">If</a>  you would like to so Great.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3859.31s">Um,</a>  my last, uh, request of a council member if they could just make a motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3866.331s">Just</a>  to request that, um <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3875.304s">the</a>  25 estimate and the 26 proposed slash estimate motion by councillor Callahan seconded by seconded by councillor Lazzaro. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3887.744s">Mr.</a>  Clerk when you have the motion</p>
