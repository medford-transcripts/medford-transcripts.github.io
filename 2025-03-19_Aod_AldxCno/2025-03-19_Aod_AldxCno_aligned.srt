00:05:59,173 --> 00:06:00,094

10
00:06:02,103 --> 00:06:04,004
And, uh, Yep.

11
00:06:04,124 --> 00:06:06,046
If we can call the role of the school committee, please.

12
00:06:06,926 --> 00:06:07,406
Member herself.

13
00:06:15,111 --> 00:06:15,392
No.

00:06:16,172 --> 00:06:18,393
Member Brantley present.

00:06:19,734 --> 00:06:20,115
Ever Graham.

7 present, 0 absent, the entire school committee is here.

17
00:06:35,737 --> 00:06:38,940
Mr. Kirk, if you could please call the roll for the council.

18
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:39,801
Councilor Callahan.

19
00:06:40,481 --> 00:06:41,362
Vice President Collins.

20
00:06:41,983 --> 00:06:42,323
Present.

21
00:06:43,084 --> 00:06:43,724
Councilor Lozaro.

22
00:06:43,744 --> 00:06:43,905
Present.

23
00:06:44,765 --> 00:06:45,326
Councilor Lemming.

24
00:06:45,786 --> 00:06:46,287
Present.

25
00:06:47,047 --> 00:06:47,868
Councilor Scarpelli.

26
00:06:48,248 --> 00:06:48,589
Present.

27
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:50,691
Councilor Sang.

28
00:06:51,732 --> 00:06:52,112
Present.

29
00:06:53,073 --> 00:06:53,693
President Behrs.

30
00:06:53,753 --> 00:06:54,234
Present.

31
00:06:54,254 --> 00:06:55,175
7 present, none absent.

32
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:56,556
Meeting is called to order.

33
00:06:59,153 --> 00:07:01,875
First matter is the joint rules.

34
00:07:03,135 --> 00:07:05,237
Have folks had time to read the joint rules?

35
00:07:06,578 --> 00:07:08,859
Are there any comments from members of the Council on the joint rules?

36
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:10,621
Motion to waive the reading.

37
00:07:15,024 --> 00:07:15,524
We can do that.

38
00:07:18,126 --> 00:07:20,928
Maybe we make it a motion to waive the reading and approve and then we can discuss it.

39
00:07:22,239 --> 00:07:24,862
Okay, then we don't have to vote 14 times.

40
00:07:25,643 --> 00:07:27,986
All right, so I have a motion and a second on the council.

41
00:07:28,006 --> 00:07:29,808
Is there a motion and a second on the school committee?

42
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:31,910
Yes.

43
00:07:33,893 --> 00:07:34,093
Great.

44
00:07:34,774 --> 00:07:39,699
All right, any discussion from members of the council on the joint rules as proposed?

45
00:07:41,862 --> 00:07:42,643
Any from the school committee?

46
00:07:45,305 --> 00:07:51,567
Seeing none on the motion of Councillor Callahan, seconded by Councillor Lazzaro.

47
00:07:52,207 --> 00:07:54,868
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll to approve the rules.

48
00:07:55,768 --> 00:07:56,228
Councillor Callahan.

49
00:07:56,248 --> 00:07:56,368
Yes.

50
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:58,049
Vice President Collins.

51
00:07:58,369 --> 00:07:58,549
Yes.

52
00:07:59,709 --> 00:08:00,429
Councillor Lazzaro.

53
00:08:00,469 --> 00:08:00,589
Yes.

54
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:02,290
Councillor Lemming.

55
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:03,050
Yes.

56
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:04,550
Councillor Scarpelli.

57
00:08:05,851 --> 00:08:06,131
Yes.

58
00:08:07,091 --> 00:08:07,631
Councillor Singh.

59
00:08:08,612 --> 00:08:08,892
Yes.

60
00:08:09,612 --> 00:08:10,132
President Behrs.

61
00:08:10,792 --> 00:08:11,012
Yes.

62
00:08:11,072 --> 00:08:13,693
I've been affirmed and then the negative motion passes the council.

63
00:08:14,198 --> 00:08:19,841
Motion has also taken place in seconded for the school committee member so call the roll.

64
00:08:20,242 --> 00:08:21,402
Certainly, Member Brantley.

65
00:08:22,163 --> 00:08:22,423
Yes.

66
00:08:23,243 --> 00:08:23,724
Member Graham.

67
00:08:24,644 --> 00:08:25,305
Member and Tapa.

68
00:08:26,145 --> 00:08:26,445
Yes.

69
00:08:26,465 --> 00:08:28,066
Remember all the party.

70
00:08:28,186 --> 00:08:28,467
Yes.

71
00:08:28,807 --> 00:08:31,788
Member Reinfeldt members so yes Marilyn go current.

72
00:08:31,949 --> 00:08:35,331
Yes, 70 affirmative Sierra the negative motion passes.

73
00:08:36,011 --> 00:08:37,492
So, rules are adopted for

74
00:08:38,077 --> 00:08:39,458
tonight's meeting and moving forward.

75
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:40,159
Thank you.

76
00:08:41,561 --> 00:08:49,009
We have a resolution by President Behrs to discuss the schedule of annual budget process for fiscal year 2026.

77
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:55,275
And whatever it is on your agenda, I don't, did you have a number?

78
00:08:58,859 --> 00:09:00,641
I know on the school committee version of this.

79
00:09:03,165 --> 00:09:03,825
Okay.

80
00:09:04,045 --> 00:09:06,106
25039 on the school committee agenda.

81
00:09:07,026 --> 00:09:10,207
And tonight we, I don't know if you want to talk about tonight.

82
00:09:10,227 --> 00:09:15,649
We have chief of staff, Nina Nazarian and CFO, Bob Dickinson from the city of Medford.

83
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:23,372
And when we're ready, CFO Dickinson has a slideshow presentation and can present an overview of the city's finances.

84
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,641
Great.

85
00:09:25,781 --> 00:09:27,543
We had a meeting last night on recommendations.

86
00:09:27,563 --> 00:09:31,186
We're planning to send them over to your office, this council, to the mayor.

87
00:09:31,206 --> 00:09:34,208
I know you guys have had a budget process.

88
00:09:34,268 --> 00:09:36,510
I'll go to member, well, you should go to member Graham.

89
00:09:37,111 --> 00:09:37,491
Member Graham?

90
00:09:40,436 --> 00:09:52,287
had a preliminary budget meeting where we've started talking about the school committee budget from an enrollment projection standpoint and from a funding revenue sources perspective.

91
00:09:52,327 --> 00:09:53,508
So that has already happened.

92
00:09:53,968 --> 00:10:01,415
We have a meeting tomorrow night where we will hear from our finance office and the superintendent about their recommended budget.

93
00:10:01,895 --> 00:10:04,137
And our budget hearing will be held on Monday,

94
00:10:05,758 --> 00:10:05,858
4th.

95
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:06,378
Thank you.

96
00:10:07,599 --> 00:10:18,702
My days are running together, but we will have a budget hearing on the 24th, and we will either take action to send that to the mayor that evening or in a subsequent meeting the first week of April.

97
00:10:19,442 --> 00:10:26,925
So we are slightly off what our intended target was, and we discussed that back in January, but we had to make way for the

98
00:10:27,985 --> 00:10:30,627
the budgeting process for the supplemental budget for FY 25.

99
00:10:30,687 --> 00:10:32,609
So that sort of took priority in January.

100
00:10:32,829 --> 00:10:40,475
We'll be back on track after that and be ready to submit to the mayor our request to the municipality in early April.

101
00:10:42,497 --> 00:10:43,838
Is that member Reinfeld?

102
00:10:45,659 --> 00:10:45,839
Nope.

103
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,601
Is there, are you, have you requested?

104
00:10:47,621 --> 00:10:51,504
For some reason, mic five has a request on it.

105
00:10:52,905 --> 00:10:53,165
All good.

106
00:10:55,387 --> 00:10:55,567
Great.

107
00:10:57,302 --> 00:10:59,944
No other comments or questions, we'll start the presentation.

108
00:11:01,225 --> 00:11:08,410
See you all.

109
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:12,533
I'm hoping all the technology actually works.

110
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:27,312
I know this from Nantucket Town meetings when people have the microphone here.

111
00:11:27,332 --> 00:11:30,013
It's like, no, pretend you're Mick Jagger.

112
00:11:30,033 --> 00:11:36,256
So I'm trying to share my screen.

113
00:11:36,276 --> 00:11:43,039
Is that working?

114
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,300
Share.

115
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,961
OK.

116
00:11:52,675 --> 00:11:55,456
If I can actually make all the rest of this stuff go away.

117
00:12:02,199 --> 00:12:03,280
Financial update.

118
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:18,807
All right, this is the mandated finance department update for fiscal, what's been going on in fiscal 2025, throughout the new estimates for

119
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:28,977
Our budgeting purposes for fiscal 2026 will go through the levy limit local receipts, cherry sheets, other revenue.

120
00:12:30,878 --> 00:12:31,379
OK.

121
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:46,531
My audio and video are off for Zoom.

122
00:12:48,221 --> 00:12:51,704
And I have an echo so I can start playing Pink Floyd songs.

123
00:12:56,288 --> 00:13:04,876
A low tech solution will

124
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,522
see if he's got a thick book in there or something.

125
00:13:45,663 --> 00:13:46,784
Checking 1, 2, 3.

126
00:13:56,289 --> 00:13:58,230
Everybody can hear me now without the.

127
00:14:02,069 --> 00:14:03,289
technical difficulties.

128
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:07,791
I just got back from the annual Mass.

129
00:14:07,811 --> 00:14:12,392
Municipal Auditors and Accountants Association spring training.

130
00:14:12,652 --> 00:14:18,874
So I got in a car at about 1.30 and drove from Amherst to here.

131
00:14:19,634 --> 00:14:22,975
So I wasn't able to get here early enough to make sure all this works.

132
00:14:24,876 --> 00:14:27,297
They're a lively bunch, the auditors and accountants.

133
00:14:39,633 --> 00:14:39,813
Yes.

134
00:14:41,034 --> 00:14:41,434
OK.

135
00:14:42,034 --> 00:14:56,900
So again, the update for 2025, the update revenue estimates for 2026 go through the levy limit, local receipts, cherry sheets, other revenue.

136
00:14:58,061 --> 00:15:05,084
And what we think, what our projection right now is for what might be available for the budget for fiscal 2026.

137
00:15:08,986 --> 00:15:17,612
and various side notes on explaining how we got to these numbers.

138
00:15:18,453 --> 00:15:22,817
And of course, the caveat on all of this is that these numbers change.

139
00:15:25,219 --> 00:15:32,765
Unfortunately, I don't have a crystal ball, and I can't look into the future and see exactly how much we'll have.

140
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:36,868
Various things that change, well, we can go through them.

141
00:15:38,718 --> 00:15:42,699
All right, for the finance department, we finished the state reporting.

142
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:46,340
The fiscal 24 books are closed.

143
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:52,942
The 24 audit, actually, we should have that in hand.

144
00:15:53,982 --> 00:16:01,504
I didn't change that on the slide, but we should have that in hand probably by Monday morning, and it will be submitted.

145
00:16:02,304 --> 00:16:07,005
Also, the single audit will all be done well before the end of March.

146
00:16:08,813 --> 00:16:13,335
So pre-cash retained earnings were certified.

147
00:16:14,236 --> 00:16:16,417
Pre-cash as of June 30, 2024 is $28,343,997.

148
00:16:16,457 --> 00:16:17,838
Retained earnings for Water Sewer Enterprise is $12,653,475.

149
00:16:34,332 --> 00:16:38,434
Last year, we had $34 million in free cash, roughly.

150
00:16:39,655 --> 00:16:44,017
But we used $14 million of it to fund the stabilization funds.

151
00:16:46,098 --> 00:16:49,020
And then we had about $1 million in turnbacks.

152
00:16:49,860 --> 00:17:02,367
And we had $6.2 million in excess local receipts, which is why we were able to take 34, drop it to 20, and then come back to $28 million.

153
00:17:06,237 --> 00:17:06,437
Sure.

154
00:17:14,185 --> 00:17:14,766
Member Roussel?

155
00:17:15,126 --> 00:17:15,446
Thank you.

156
00:17:15,987 --> 00:17:17,949
Could you tell us what turnbacks are?

157
00:17:19,656 --> 00:17:23,340
When a department doesn't spend its whole budget.

158
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,921
I mean, that's where free cash comes from.

159
00:17:25,442 --> 00:17:26,784
You estimate your revenue.

160
00:17:27,204 --> 00:17:39,358
If you get more revenue, obviously you'll make more, you know, you'll have more free cash, but also in situations, for instance, police and fire will frequently have budgeted positions.

161
00:17:40,098 --> 00:17:44,922
but they're unable to be filled because there simply aren't policemen and firemen out there.

162
00:17:45,482 --> 00:17:49,606
So that can be a significant source of a turn back.

163
00:17:50,286 --> 00:17:51,727
We just didn't spend the whole budget.

164
00:17:52,628 --> 00:17:59,794
So on the recap, the budget, your appropriations have to match what you're taking in.

165
00:17:59,934 --> 00:18:04,598
So if you spend less than the appropriation, then that goes to free cash.

166
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:07,460
Councilor Zara.

167
00:18:08,542 --> 00:18:09,323
Very quick question.

168
00:18:09,363 --> 00:18:13,306
Can you send us this presentation after the meeting?

169
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:13,986
What?

170
00:18:14,207 --> 00:18:15,808
Can you send this presentation to us after the meeting?

171
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:16,148
Oh, yes, of course.

172
00:18:16,168 --> 00:18:16,588
Thank you so much.

173
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:18,870
All righty.

174
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:20,932
I just had one question, Bob.

175
00:18:21,232 --> 00:18:24,555
Are you going to go into what the excess local receipts were?

176
00:18:24,575 --> 00:18:29,739
I wasn't planning to do details on that, but I can.

177
00:18:31,412 --> 00:18:35,735
I can easily send the council exactly what happened.

178
00:18:35,755 --> 00:18:36,435
That would be helpful.

179
00:18:36,535 --> 00:18:56,788
I know one big part of it, which I'll touch on further on in the presentation, was because interest rates remained high, and our treasurer did a lot of work to make sure that we were, while keeping cash on hand to pay payroll and stuff like that, that everything else was invested in higher interest rate

180
00:18:59,502 --> 00:19:01,223
you know, vehicles.

181
00:19:02,523 --> 00:19:05,584
And we still had a whole bunch of unspent ARPA money.

182
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:14,406
So if you have an extra $20 million in ARPA money that has been allocated but hasn't yet been spent, it's sitting on our bank account.

183
00:19:14,446 --> 00:19:16,367
And that is general fund revenue.

184
00:19:17,327 --> 00:19:18,428
So that's a nice one there.

185
00:19:20,088 --> 00:19:33,876
I'll say this again later, but I do not expect for local receipts next year, which is where investment income comes into the picture, I don't expect what we're going to be getting in interest next year to be anywhere near what we got in fiscal 2024.

186
00:19:34,917 --> 00:19:41,640
But I can definitely go through the numbers and show exactly where all this money came from.

187
00:19:42,461 --> 00:19:49,225
Yeah, I think especially hearing that that's coming from interest on cash on hand or interest on investments,

188
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:55,222
just knowing how much of that 6 million was from interest on cash we don't expect to have in the future.

189
00:19:55,242 --> 00:20:02,404
I'm just wondering how that excess local receipts affects our baseline revenue estimates for fiscal 26 essentially.

190
00:20:02,424 --> 00:20:03,145
All right.

191
00:20:03,585 --> 00:20:03,785
Yes.

192
00:20:06,726 --> 00:20:07,066
All right.

193
00:20:07,686 --> 00:20:09,307
Mr. President, I have a question.

194
00:20:12,642 --> 00:20:12,902
Thank you.

195
00:20:12,922 --> 00:20:13,523
I apologize.

196
00:20:13,623 --> 00:20:15,624
I just didn't really know if you knew my standards.

197
00:20:16,325 --> 00:20:24,371
I just have to, just for clarification purposes and move forward, just to say again, Bob, we're at $28 million again in free cash?

198
00:20:25,372 --> 00:20:25,572
Yes.

199
00:20:26,072 --> 00:20:28,534
That's what we have today, $28 million again.

200
00:20:29,635 --> 00:20:30,916
Yeah.

201
00:20:31,176 --> 00:20:30,916
28,343,997.

202
00:20:31,216 --> 00:20:32,197
Thank you.

203
00:20:33,738 --> 00:20:37,221
Straight from the Bureau of Accounts, that's what they say we've got.

204
00:20:37,581 --> 00:20:38,282
So there we are.

205
00:20:39,142 --> 00:20:40,664
And just to clarify, so essentially,

206
00:20:41,487 --> 00:20:51,678
The balance was 34 million last at the end of 2020 on 630 23, but we appropriated 14 million so that's a minus 14 million.

207
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:57,845
And then there was a turn back so under spending of a million, and then an unexpected.

208
00:20:59,262 --> 00:21:08,775
over overage and local receipts of 6 million and a big portion of that was from interest that we hadn't expected to earn because interest rates were high, right.

209
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:10,077
Okay.

210
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:13,762
Then the other, the other thing that would add into.

211
00:21:15,664 --> 00:21:28,848
into free cash is obviously, you know, we have accounts receivable for tax billings and personal property tax, but that doesn't mean we're going to get it all in this year.

212
00:21:28,868 --> 00:21:33,549
It usually is around the same amount that we actually billed out.

213
00:21:34,029 --> 00:21:37,130
But if, for instance, if in one year people

214
00:21:38,957 --> 00:21:47,083
in arrears, your accounts receivable goes down when they pay you off, but your receipts for that year are larger.

215
00:21:48,264 --> 00:21:51,046
Does that make any sense?

216
00:21:51,807 --> 00:21:56,511
I'm getting into the weeds on the tax recap and how the city is funded.

217
00:21:57,151 --> 00:21:58,532
Yeah, I just wanted to clarify.

218
00:21:59,762 --> 00:22:05,845
sometimes people we didn't have $28 million of new money that was Oh, no, you know, it's a balance.

219
00:22:06,005 --> 00:22:08,747
We actually the free cash balance decreased by $6 million.

220
00:22:08,867 --> 00:22:09,947
All right.

221
00:22:10,408 --> 00:22:10,648
Thank you.

222
00:22:16,428 --> 00:22:18,449
2025 general fund budget was $189,407,845.

223
00:22:18,489 --> 00:22:24,712
Medford Public Schools received $83 million.

224
00:22:24,972 --> 00:22:31,675
And we keep an eye on all the budgets.

225
00:22:32,075 --> 00:22:37,918
We also, especially Medford Public Schools, we make sure that when we're getting into the end of the year that

226
00:22:39,639 --> 00:22:41,120
nobody's gonna be over budget.

227
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:59,453
And that usually means me working with Noel and Jeremy Q to make sure that all of the funds that might come in from grant money, those positions have actually, we've actually charged everything to the right places.

228
00:23:00,453 --> 00:23:02,535
And there are some year end transfers that happen that.

229
00:23:02,835 --> 00:23:06,838
But right now we expect everything to be fine for the Medford public schools.

230
00:23:10,895 --> 00:23:11,675
Revenue estimates.

231
00:23:12,695 --> 00:23:13,476
I'll go over this.

232
00:23:14,816 --> 00:23:34,741
I would imagine everybody here probably has a basic understanding of how we make these revenue estimates, but just to go over it again, Proposition 2 1⁄2, you take last year's levy limit, you multiply it by 1.025, and that's your levy limit for the next year.

233
00:23:39,123 --> 00:23:43,385
Once you've done that, you add in certified new growth.

234
00:23:44,045 --> 00:23:49,267
This is another, the levy limit itself is based on the prior year's levy limit.

235
00:23:49,307 --> 00:23:50,588
We know what that's going to be.

236
00:23:51,188 --> 00:23:57,250
Certified new growth is whatever the assessors can come up with to add to it.

237
00:23:57,330 --> 00:24:02,752
So right now that is just an estimate, but it includes all sorts of basic things.

238
00:24:02,952 --> 00:24:04,493
If you have a lot, you subdivide it.

239
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:08,238
Now you have two lots, it's worth more than it was.

240
00:24:09,159 --> 00:24:11,041
So that's certified new growth.

241
00:24:11,862 --> 00:24:17,509
And things as little, you know, if you have a house and you put on an addition, there's a bathroom, that's new growth.

242
00:24:24,017 --> 00:24:26,278
levy limit that's self-explanatory.

243
00:24:26,318 --> 00:24:28,358
You put them together, and that's what you can levy.

244
00:24:29,479 --> 00:24:42,683
And we also have to estimate state aid, cherry sheets, Chapter 70, school aid, veterans benefits, charter school money.

245
00:24:43,403 --> 00:24:52,906
And when we're doing that, we're doing the net of what the state aid will be and what the state assessments will be.

246
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:55,547
We can go into that in a little bit.

247
00:24:55,567 --> 00:25:01,030
So fiscal year 2025, levy limit is 153,506,550.

248
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:01,750
Proposition 2.5 increase is $3,837,663.75.

249
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:03,931
I doubt we'll be able to capture the $0.75, just mathematically.

250
00:25:18,878 --> 00:25:21,679
But it shouldn't be too hard to deal with.

251
00:25:22,999 --> 00:25:27,040
Our current new growth estimate from Jared, our assessor, is $2.2 million.

252
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:29,700
So our new capacity estimate is $159,544,213.75.

253
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:30,360
Local receipt.

254
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,540
Did I not change this?

255
00:25:46,978 --> 00:25:47,741
Oh, yeah.

256
00:25:47,961 --> 00:25:49,606
For fiscal 2025, local receipts were estimated at $21,124,900.

257
00:25:55,892 --> 00:26:00,514
This year, we're estimating them at $2,500,000.

258
00:26:02,635 --> 00:26:07,518
Local receipts, the big ones are motor vehicle excise, $7 million.

259
00:26:07,698 --> 00:26:10,219
I'm expecting that to be relatively flat.

260
00:26:10,759 --> 00:26:16,502
It increased a lot after the pandemic when people couldn't get cars or didn't want to buy a new car.

261
00:26:17,162 --> 00:26:20,184
But now people have bought a lot of their new cars.

262
00:26:20,744 --> 00:26:22,345
And every year, you have a car.

263
00:26:23,225 --> 00:26:25,266
your motor vehicle excise goes down.

264
00:26:25,286 --> 00:26:30,950
So unless people rush out and buy a whole bunch of new cars, I'm expecting that to be pretty much flat.

265
00:26:32,551 --> 00:26:37,834
Hotel and meals taxes, those have been increasing slightly every year.

266
00:26:37,974 --> 00:26:38,315
So we're

267
00:26:39,115 --> 00:26:41,616
We're going to go up a little bit on that one.

268
00:26:42,436 --> 00:26:44,736
Building permits, again, that's another one.

269
00:26:45,476 --> 00:26:55,058
Hopefully, people are building stuff, especially because if you get a building permit, that's one way the assessor figures out what new growth is going to be.

270
00:26:55,218 --> 00:27:00,859
He gets all the building permits and goes to the houses and says, hey, you just put an addition on.

271
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:02,660
So your assessment goes up.

272
00:27:03,992 --> 00:27:08,877
And then, as I said, investment income, $2.5 million.

273
00:27:08,937 --> 00:27:14,342
I expect that's going to be less this year because of all the money that we've actually spent.

274
00:27:19,247 --> 00:27:20,949
Anyway, local receipts for 2026, I'm estimating $21,500,000.

275
00:27:20,989 --> 00:27:22,370
Local receipts is one of those things that you

276
00:27:30,701 --> 00:27:34,303
It can vary a lot depending on economic conditions.

277
00:27:35,363 --> 00:27:44,627
So people in my position ordinarily try to make sure that we're doing a pretty conservative estimate of what it is.

278
00:27:45,547 --> 00:27:59,113
If you don't, and you get to recap time, the Department of Revenue can look at your actuals for the year and say, you're not going to make your revenue targets.

279
00:27:59,873 --> 00:28:07,617
And that means having to vote a whole new budget, because the appropriations have to meet the revenues.

280
00:28:08,637 --> 00:28:12,039
So that's one place in the recap that we tend to be

281
00:28:12,939 --> 00:28:19,073
reasonably conservative I try to make it as close as I can, but I'm not.

282
00:28:21,029 --> 00:28:24,391
I will never sit there and say, OK, we made this much last year.

283
00:28:24,431 --> 00:28:25,772
Now we're going to make more this year.

284
00:28:25,792 --> 00:28:28,573
I will never expect to make more than we did in the last year.

285
00:28:29,533 --> 00:28:43,480
I usually put it in to be less, just to be conservative, to make sure that if something actually happens in the economy, that we won't miss our revenue targets and then have to revote the whole budget based on the new numbers.

286
00:28:47,942 --> 00:28:48,623
Cherry sheets.

287
00:28:50,977 --> 00:28:58,625
initial proposal from the governor, which is the one that we use it again, it tends to be the most conservative estimate of what we're going to get.

288
00:28:58,885 --> 00:29:03,330
Usually it's a little bit more, but that's not always the case.

289
00:29:04,171 --> 00:29:06,893
So estimated receipts, 35 million charges.

290
00:29:10,537 --> 00:29:13,358
is close to $13 million.

291
00:29:13,818 --> 00:29:22,081
So the net cherry sheet revenue should be $22,358,418, according to the governor's current proposal.

292
00:29:23,001 --> 00:29:30,844
If you don't know, cherry sheets go through the governor, and the House votes on what they think they should be, and the Senate votes on what they think

293
00:29:31,564 --> 00:29:32,104
they should be.

294
00:29:32,124 --> 00:29:36,766
And then we get the final numbers when everybody gets together and makes a deal.

295
00:29:37,826 --> 00:29:42,587
So we had three more iterations of what cherry sheet receipts might be.

296
00:29:43,367 --> 00:29:50,430
So that's another place where there's significant uncertainty about what we might actually end up with at the end of the year.

297
00:29:55,011 --> 00:29:55,411
Member Graham.

298
00:30:01,707 --> 00:30:05,834
planning purposes for the cherry sheet, FY26 net cherry sheet?

299
00:30:08,059 --> 00:30:09,441
No, sorry, that's a typo.

300
00:30:09,481 --> 00:30:10,964
That would have been the 2025 net cherry sheet, I believe.

301
00:30:13,121 --> 00:30:16,922
OK, so the 22-3 is what you're estimating for cherry sheet?

302
00:30:16,942 --> 00:30:17,622
Yes, that's what I'm estimating.

303
00:30:17,642 --> 00:30:17,982
OK, thank you.

304
00:30:18,463 --> 00:30:29,146
If you want, I have the, it's easy enough to get on the DOR website what cherry sheet numbers for the last 10, 15 years.

305
00:30:29,926 --> 00:30:30,986
I actually have a spreadsheet.

306
00:30:31,006 --> 00:30:41,369
When I'm doing the spreadsheet to put together the recap, I actually have the exact numbers from the last several years so I can make a prediction on where they're going.

307
00:30:45,477 --> 00:30:49,559
a reduction in cherry sheets as you do your budget planning, or are you?

308
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:50,960
At this point, no.

309
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:59,645
I'm using the governor's initial cherry sheet proposal is already out on the website.

310
00:31:00,365 --> 00:31:05,008
So we just go with that number, because usually it's right around there, if not a little bit more.

311
00:31:06,529 --> 00:31:07,229
OK, perfect.

312
00:31:07,329 --> 00:31:08,170
I just wanted to clarify.

313
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:11,492
Things are wild right now, so thanks.

314
00:31:13,314 --> 00:31:14,835
Thank you, any questions from the public on that?

315
00:31:14,895 --> 00:31:15,496
No, sorry.

316
00:31:17,277 --> 00:31:17,978
Go ahead, Bob.

317
00:31:18,118 --> 00:31:18,879
I can just comment, too.

318
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:25,924
I think most cities and towns use the governor's proposal, because that's all we really have in the House and then the Senate and then joint conference.

319
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:27,706
If anything changes, we're going to have to adjust.

320
00:31:28,086 --> 00:31:33,310
Hopefully, we just stop and knock down and spend some time in the state house yesterday.

321
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:38,334
So they are watching what's going on federally and are going to adjust accordingly, depending on if and when.

322
00:31:38,654 --> 00:31:41,056
So we're going to keep track of it as much as we can.

323
00:31:45,638 --> 00:32:00,473
Alrighty, so other revenue that the city receives casino mitigation funds, funds, these are transfers into the general fund to fund positions casino mitigation funds three positions.

324
00:32:02,074 --> 00:32:09,098
We get money in from the sales of cemetery lots and the perpetual care trust fund.

325
00:32:09,738 --> 00:32:17,442
So every year the treasurer sends us what the available revenue is from the trust.

326
00:32:18,302 --> 00:32:20,104
from the interest on the trust.

327
00:32:20,965 --> 00:32:24,670
And that gets added to the budget as a transfer in from the trust fund.

328
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:27,092
Then there's indirect costs.

329
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:32,739
Water and sewer enterprise fund is assessed for expenses budgeted in the general fund.

330
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:48,455
AP payroll, processing, healthcare, we have to, that's another number that we have to pay a lot of attention to, to make sure that we've got good estimates of what that might be.

331
00:32:49,468 --> 00:33:10,000
We don't at this time, we've been told that health insurance is going up by probably 10%, but we do not at this time I believe have the actual final numbers on what our health insurance costs are going to be next year that can could change at the MMA concert conference that I was just at.

332
00:33:11,367 --> 00:33:18,069
Some communities are seeing increases of as much as 20% in their healthcare costs.

333
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:21,911
There are many communities that are experiencing 12, 15%.

334
00:33:23,992 --> 00:33:33,475
And when you multiply 20% by what we're paying right now, which is $25 million or something like that, that eats up a lot of your budget.

335
00:33:33,895 --> 00:33:39,677
So that's something we're working on very closely and definitely keeping an eye on.

336
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:51,485
So this is pretty much the summary, if you can all see it without the caption.

337
00:33:57,939 --> 00:34:03,247
So you can see the breakdown of all these numbers, the 2025 levy limit 153 million times 2.5 plus the new growth.

338
00:34:03,267 --> 00:34:04,990
Gives us the 159 million for property taxes.

339
00:34:14,717 --> 00:34:16,658
That flows to the next section.

340
00:34:16,758 --> 00:34:28,523
So we're saying 21.5 for local receipts, state aid, 35 million, indirect costs, sales of lots, et cetera, 218 million.

341
00:34:30,744 --> 00:34:34,006
Then below that, we have non-budgeted expenses.

342
00:34:34,186 --> 00:34:36,927
These appear on the recap page two.

343
00:34:37,913 --> 00:34:51,998
They're non budgeted, and they are the things like the cherry sheet assessments, which are going to be 12, which we're putting in the governor's numbers again that's the breakdown of this net is $12.8 million.

344
00:34:54,414 --> 00:34:55,034
tax title.

345
00:34:55,114 --> 00:35:07,838
It's a small amount, but that allows the treasurer to do the legal work for properties where the homeowner has not paid their taxes in a while.

346
00:35:08,879 --> 00:35:13,620
Snow and ice deficit last year, it wasn't anywhere near that.

347
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,760
I think it was $400,000, but

348
00:35:17,383 --> 00:35:23,324
We know we've had a little bit of snow this winter, so that's a legal deficit that you can put on the books.

349
00:35:24,224 --> 00:35:26,865
Right now, the estimate is $750,000.

350
00:35:26,925 --> 00:35:32,726
Hopefully, with the warm weather, we won't be experiencing another huge snowstorm, knock on wood.

351
00:35:33,566 --> 00:35:34,986
But right now, that's what it looks like.

352
00:35:35,066 --> 00:35:36,667
Our snow and ice deficit will be.

353
00:35:37,187 --> 00:35:38,807
That has to be raised on the recap.

354
00:35:40,447 --> 00:35:44,168
And then every year, it's good to put

355
00:35:45,979 --> 00:35:49,805
It's good to keep a close eye on your overlay.

356
00:35:51,175 --> 00:35:53,177
This is the money that funds tax abatements.

357
00:35:54,138 --> 00:35:58,481
So I work with the assessor to see what's out there.

358
00:35:58,581 --> 00:36:02,545
And we total up how much money we actually have in overlay.

359
00:36:02,565 --> 00:36:09,111
And we put in what we think we might need in case things go against us.

360
00:36:09,191 --> 00:36:14,315
And we have to, I think right now there are a couple of large projects where

361
00:36:16,597 --> 00:36:19,762
you know, lawyers are involved and they want a big abatement.

362
00:36:19,922 --> 00:36:33,060
So that's something that I work with the assessor to make sure I have a good number and we've put enough money into the overlay so that we have enough money to pay these if we need to.

363
00:36:34,810 --> 00:36:36,211
And that gives you the bottom line.

364
00:36:36,231 --> 00:36:45,877
It's roughly a little less than $205 million that we have available to spend at this point in time, as far as I know.

365
00:36:47,178 --> 00:36:51,800
Again, if you know where I could get a crystal ball so I can do this better, that would be great.

366
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:56,803
Is this making sense to everyone?

367
00:36:56,823 --> 00:37:02,407
Is that all of the, oh, looks like Paul wants to.

368
00:37:02,807 --> 00:37:04,288
Yep, you have some more slides too, right?

369
00:37:05,971 --> 00:37:06,612
Member Rousseau.

370
00:37:06,992 --> 00:37:08,073
Thank you.

371
00:37:08,493 --> 00:37:15,178
I just, the state assessments, I did look it up and just shy of 8 million of that is actually charter tuition.

372
00:37:16,719 --> 00:37:20,102
Just wanted to point that out, not for you, you know that.

373
00:37:20,922 --> 00:37:23,544
And Councilor Lemming has his hand up.

374
00:37:25,546 --> 00:37:30,390
Member Rousseau just made the point that 8 million of the state assessments is for charter schools.

375
00:37:32,411 --> 00:37:34,673
And go ahead Matt, Councilor Lemming.

376
00:37:35,685 --> 00:37:36,065
Thank you.

377
00:37:37,806 --> 00:37:42,468
I understand that this could be outside the purview of the budget.

378
00:37:42,488 --> 00:37:45,410
It could be like tied up in grants and stuff like that.

379
00:37:46,671 --> 00:37:59,537
But Mr. Dinkinson, is there a way to get sort of a year by year number of the amount of money that the city receives from the federal government?

380
00:38:01,638 --> 00:38:05,140
Or are those statistics or trends handy anywhere?

381
00:38:09,391 --> 00:38:13,572
Right now, we're keeping a close eye on that.

382
00:38:13,612 --> 00:38:17,753
I'm trying to formulate a list of all the monies that we get from the federal government.

383
00:38:19,094 --> 00:38:25,376
I don't have an exact figure for that at this point in time.

384
00:38:26,456 --> 00:38:28,797
But I could probably get this.

385
00:38:28,977 --> 00:38:32,338
The single audit would have all the big numbers for that.

386
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,961
I could look into putting that together.

387
00:38:37,981 --> 00:38:47,309
And I can add to that it's been a project we've been working on since January to try to pull the numbers from every department.

388
00:38:48,210 --> 00:39:02,923
We just recently gave everything to finance to kind of tidy up so we can get you a copy of what's currently we're receiving in federal funding a lot of that is recurring but of course there's some that are that are grants that are one time or over several year period but I think it would be a huge endeavor to

389
00:39:03,764 --> 00:39:09,089
go back years, but I think we can definitely get you a snapshot of what we're looking at now within the next several weeks.

390
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:18,700
I know the finance department's been working on trying to get that together in a readable format for us to just keep an eye on as these are such uncertain times.

391
00:39:22,821 --> 00:39:23,322
Thank you.

392
00:39:24,383 --> 00:39:27,426
Even, even just a ballpark estimate of previous years.

393
00:39:29,609 --> 00:39:37,578
And this year, if you have it I understand it could be irresponsible to offer that now but any information is appreciated.

394
00:39:37,638 --> 00:39:37,999
Thank you.

395
00:39:40,181 --> 00:39:40,561
Thank you.

396
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:47,544
Um, do you have an estimate?

397
00:39:48,704 --> 00:39:52,685
Or my own education because I can't remember the new growth in prior years.

398
00:39:52,785 --> 00:39:57,006
Is this average amount or a smaller amount or larger amount?

399
00:39:57,046 --> 00:40:04,668
It seems small to me, but well, uh, new growth really depends on the year.

400
00:40:05,108 --> 00:40:07,509
It also quite frankly, depends on staffing.

401
00:40:07,969 --> 00:40:08,289
If, um

402
00:40:10,317 --> 00:40:17,241
Because in order to assess new growth, you have to actually physically go to the property and say, look, you've got an addition.

403
00:40:21,084 --> 00:40:25,266
Our previous assessor worked very hard on making sure we got those numbers.

404
00:40:26,007 --> 00:40:28,368
And we're definitely keeping up with that.

405
00:40:30,662 --> 00:40:32,283
But it can vary a lot per year.

406
00:40:32,643 --> 00:40:33,984
It's straight on the recap.

407
00:40:34,384 --> 00:40:41,768
So if you want how much we got for the last 10 years, I can put that together really quite quickly.

408
00:40:41,808 --> 00:40:46,130
You can just go into gateway and this is what it was.

409
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:48,331
It's certified by the state.

410
00:40:49,111 --> 00:40:53,693
So once the state says you can put in this number, that's what you can put in.

411
00:40:55,237 --> 00:40:57,519
And I can just add, we did look into that last year.

412
00:40:57,539 --> 00:41:05,347
I think we looked back about 20 years and there's only been three years where it's been over 2 million and that's been in the last four or five.

413
00:41:05,747 --> 00:41:06,327
Okay, great.

414
00:41:06,588 --> 00:41:07,068
That's helpful.

415
00:41:07,088 --> 00:41:07,288
Thank you.

416
00:41:07,308 --> 00:41:07,889
I appreciate that.

417
00:41:16,678 --> 00:41:17,279
that network?

418
00:41:17,339 --> 00:41:17,659
Okay, good.

419
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:34,154
I was going to add what the mayor added, but also will add that as Bob stated, as finance director Dickinson stated, this is a particularly challenging year because we have transitioned and we have a new chief assessor, Jared Yazian, has become the chief assessor, which we're very excited about.

420
00:41:34,935 --> 00:41:41,080
We are working towards hiring the assistant assessor, but we're also in a reevaluation year.

421
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:41,161
So

422
00:41:42,902 --> 00:41:45,584
It's a significant amount of work and we have a vacancy.

423
00:41:45,684 --> 00:41:51,027
So just to kind of compliment, but we've been in the ballpark of $2.5 million.

424
00:41:51,087 --> 00:42:00,013
This year, we're just being mindful that there are elements that are a little bit beyond our control despite how hard we've been trying to move that wheel.

425
00:42:00,873 --> 00:42:01,754
So anyway, thank you.

426
00:42:12,792 --> 00:42:13,292
Moving along.

427
00:42:16,134 --> 00:42:29,843
So as in previous years, the assistant finance director, chief of staff, and mayor have been in correspondence with all of the department heads about the fiscal 26 preliminary numbers.

428
00:42:31,064 --> 00:42:42,151
And the assistant finance director really does go through these budgets with a fine-toothed cone to make sure that, you know, to make sure that

429
00:42:44,054 --> 00:42:48,758
any unspent categories from prior years.

430
00:42:48,838 --> 00:42:53,041
We look at them, we make sure that that is in there.

431
00:42:53,521 --> 00:42:58,966
Again, there's things like police salaries, for instance.

432
00:42:59,086 --> 00:43:12,036
We may have positions available in police and fire salaries that can't be filled, but we still have to be cognizant of the fact that we might be able to fill them, so we have to have the budget there in case we can't.

433
00:43:13,485 --> 00:43:20,470
So getting the people for the unfilled positions is important.

434
00:43:20,490 --> 00:43:27,635
This will be, obviously, this work is ongoing until the final budget is submitted to the council, which should be at the end of May.

435
00:43:30,277 --> 00:43:37,403
So, and yeah, I guess our deadline is Friday, May 30th, to get all this stuff in front of you.

436
00:43:46,283 --> 00:43:47,624
Back to health insurance, yes.

437
00:43:49,285 --> 00:43:57,131
The fiscal 2025 budget was $28 million, so now we're over $31 million estimated in health insurance.

438
00:43:59,773 --> 00:44:00,634
That's significant.

439
00:44:00,854 --> 00:44:07,459
If you think about how we raise revenue, the big one is Prop 2.5 and new growth.

440
00:44:07,739 --> 00:44:09,941
If we can get 2.5%, we know we can get, and then new growth

441
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:23,582
Historically it's been on the average since I've been here on the average of three and a half to 4% total that our levy limit has gone up.

442
00:44:24,422 --> 00:44:36,006
So if you have a significant part of your budget that is going up 10% and historically the amount you get from your tax levy goes up around 4%.

443
00:44:38,184 --> 00:44:40,564
That's a big gaping hole in the budget.

444
00:44:41,285 --> 00:44:44,845
It's going to be difficult to weather that.

445
00:44:45,105 --> 00:44:50,286
And hopefully, in subsequent years, it won't be going up that much.

446
00:44:50,786 --> 00:44:56,087
But that's one thing we're working very hard to figure out how to resolve.

447
00:44:58,388 --> 00:45:05,329
Workers' compensation for this year, it's on target, except workers' compensation, the problem with

448
00:45:05,950 --> 00:45:22,434
trying to estimate that as we'll have workers who have been out because of injuries for a long time, and they will, the HR department and legal will be working on making, you know, saying, okay, if we give you this much, have we settled this claim?

449
00:45:22,795 --> 00:45:24,915
We had a very large settlement in July.

450
00:45:25,595 --> 00:45:27,116
It was $165,000.

451
00:45:27,756 --> 00:45:35,538
So at that point, that's probably going to be over budget by the time we get to the end of the year.

452
00:45:37,733 --> 00:45:38,894
pension obligations.

453
00:45:40,456 --> 00:45:58,195
I'm on the retirement board and we have the current schedule that we have keeps the increase that we have to pay every year to around three and a half to 4%, which is very good because it keeps up, like I said before,

454
00:45:59,697 --> 00:46:11,322
If your tax revenue is going up by roughly 4% when you add in the new growth, if you have your pension obligations going up more than that, that's a problem.

455
00:46:11,762 --> 00:46:18,605
This way, we'll be paying more every year, but hopefully, it will only take up the same portion of the budget that it did last year.

456
00:46:22,390 --> 00:46:24,232
And of course, contractual increases.

457
00:46:25,093 --> 00:46:28,516
When we're putting together the budget, we have to look at what the contracts say.

458
00:46:29,437 --> 00:46:30,538
That's non-negotiable.

459
00:46:30,618 --> 00:46:31,719
We signed a contract.

460
00:46:31,779 --> 00:46:40,006
So if it says that in July 1st, everybody in the clerical union gets another 2.5%, well, that's gonna go up.

461
00:46:41,848 --> 00:46:46,993
So those are the main things that we look at very closely when we're doing the budget.

462
00:46:49,593 --> 00:46:51,654
Revenue adjustments, increased local receipts.

463
00:46:52,915 --> 00:46:54,835
By a little bit, it's conservative.

464
00:46:55,016 --> 00:47:04,380
Again, I have to be able to, I can't go out on a limb on this without having the DOR call me and say, hey, Bob, do you really think you're gonna make that much more money?

465
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,541
So I keep them conservative.

466
00:47:09,302 --> 00:47:10,883
I think right now we're at,

467
00:47:12,578 --> 00:47:16,323
Um, putting 400,000 into overlay for 2026.

468
00:47:16,383 --> 00:47:19,606
That was an adjustment.

469
00:47:19,706 --> 00:47:21,008
We think we can weather that.

470
00:47:21,108 --> 00:47:28,176
That probably gives us a nice enough cushion in the overlay so we can pay for any large abatements we might have to pay.

471
00:47:28,196 --> 00:47:30,619
And that's also...

472
00:47:32,441 --> 00:47:43,386
It's an adjustable number in the recap, but when my snow and ice just jumped by $350,000, I'm like, okay, well, maybe we can drop this by a little.

473
00:47:44,226 --> 00:47:53,051
Again, this is just an illustration of how, when you're putting the budget together, there's a lot of moving pieces to it, and a lot of them can change.

474
00:47:54,588 --> 00:47:57,210
So I did change that number.

475
00:47:57,290 --> 00:48:00,312
The latest new growth estimate is $2.2 million.

476
00:48:02,494 --> 00:48:07,177
This is another kind of complicated accounting detail.

477
00:48:08,698 --> 00:48:16,004
Some projects that are not finished or some nonprofit organizations don't pay property taxes.

478
00:48:16,144 --> 00:48:19,947
They pay what's known as pilot or payments in lieu of taxes.

479
00:48:20,747 --> 00:48:31,115
Now, there's a development through the Mystic Valley Development Corporation that will be moving off of pilot payments.

480
00:48:31,175 --> 00:48:34,357
They've been paying us pilot payments for, I think, 10 years.

481
00:48:36,597 --> 00:48:46,281
That's gonna be part of the $2.2 million that we're expecting in new growth, because we will now put them on the tax rolls, which is good because then every year we can add that to our levy.

482
00:48:46,961 --> 00:48:54,564
But those pilot payments won't be as large anymore because that was a significant chunk of what we were getting in pilot payments.

483
00:48:55,365 --> 00:48:57,145
So that's part of local receipts.

484
00:48:58,186 --> 00:49:00,787
So that's why I try to be conservative with local receipts.

485
00:49:02,339 --> 00:49:04,341
I just had one question on that, Bob.

486
00:49:05,262 --> 00:49:18,455
And I think for folks, this is the essentially the riverside development riverside chest done through the brownfields and right complicated thing are the pilot payments, more than what we will end up receiving

487
00:49:19,601 --> 00:49:21,383
in taxes from the properties.

488
00:49:22,083 --> 00:49:24,606
We will get more in taxes than we were getting in pilot payments.

489
00:49:24,806 --> 00:49:27,428
And that adds to our levy.

490
00:49:28,149 --> 00:49:32,352
So every year, 2.5% is tacked onto that.

491
00:49:32,693 --> 00:49:35,315
So it's a net gain, but it's shifting into new growth.

492
00:49:35,335 --> 00:49:35,996
It's just shifting.

493
00:49:36,496 --> 00:49:40,740
Yes, it's shifting into new growth from local receipts.

494
00:49:48,954 --> 00:50:00,691
And again, when I started here, when we're reviewing the budgets, we've been very careful to make sure that large capital expenses aren't included.

495
00:50:04,134 --> 00:50:05,376
in operating budgets.

496
00:50:06,478 --> 00:50:18,917
So if the DPW, for instance, needs a new truck, we want to keep that separate because we want to keep the operating expenses being things like paper supplies, salt, stuff that is consumable.

497
00:50:20,297 --> 00:50:35,169
In general, the idea is that if you have an asset that's going to last more than five years, five years or more, that you actually keep it out of the operating budget and you pay for things like that by using free cash or other sources.

498
00:50:38,132 --> 00:50:46,779
And again, we very closely review all the budgets going back about five years to see if everybody's spending all their money and what they're spending it on.

499
00:50:50,035 --> 00:51:06,179
We've been centralizing the facilities costs and information technology, trying to get the budgets in the right places to make sure that if there's savings or efficiencies we can get from that, that we actually capitalize on those.

500
00:51:07,319 --> 00:51:18,202
That would be, for instance, making sure that over the years, the IT department has done things like make sure we have one license from Adobe for Adobe Acrobat.

501
00:51:19,162 --> 00:51:24,743
And different departments didn't go out and get their own license.

502
00:51:25,443 --> 00:51:30,785
So that way, we can have some savings by consolidating it, and we have a better bargaining position.

503
00:51:34,285 --> 00:51:40,327
And I think that's all I've got.

504
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:46,008
I wish I was better at the technology, quite frankly.

505
00:51:50,103 --> 00:51:52,205
So yeah, that's a overview.

506
00:51:52,305 --> 00:51:55,128
I hope I didn't bore anybody too much.

507
00:51:56,510 --> 00:52:03,297
It's a lot of numbers, and that's really what I do.

508
00:52:06,802 --> 00:52:13,866
Okay, just enough to give you, and this is really, again, I can't stress enough that this is an ongoing process.

509
00:52:13,886 --> 00:52:20,309
We worked with department heads, we look at their budgets, we make sure the budgets are the right size to do what is necessary.

510
00:52:21,890 --> 00:52:28,973
When the budgets, when we work with the department heads to do this, we have, okay, what did you have last year?

511
00:52:29,754 --> 00:52:32,055
These are contractual increases for your staff.

512
00:52:33,015 --> 00:52:35,317
This is what you spent last year on expenses.

513
00:52:36,155 --> 00:52:39,756
And then below that will be, this is stuff that we know.

514
00:52:40,116 --> 00:52:47,439
For instance, obviously, the GIC, if we see 10% in our health insurance costs, we know that's going to happen.

515
00:52:48,059 --> 00:52:48,499
It could be 9%.

516
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:50,460
It could be 11%.

517
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:53,601
But we have to put that in there, because we have to pay that.

518
00:52:53,741 --> 00:52:55,222
There's nothing we can do about it.

519
00:52:56,623 --> 00:52:57,704
Software increases.

520
00:52:58,224 --> 00:53:05,890
Every year, the software admins that runs the general ledger, every year they give us an increase.

521
00:53:06,871 --> 00:53:12,776
We try to negotiate with them to keep it as small as possible, but that has to be in the finance department budget.

522
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:13,837
We have to pay for it.

523
00:53:14,984 --> 00:53:25,548
And then below that, we would have the department head say, OK, if I have another position, it'll cost this much, but that position can do this, that, and the other thing.

524
00:53:25,908 --> 00:53:28,649
And that's the departmental wish list.

525
00:53:29,810 --> 00:53:37,093
So that's essentially what we work on for the next couple of months.

526
00:53:38,213 --> 00:53:42,735
And then, obviously, I'm updating the revenue estimates pretty much weekly.

527
00:53:52,927 --> 00:54:00,954
Member Rousseau.

528
00:54:01,275 --> 00:54:01,615
Thank you.

529
00:54:03,317 --> 00:54:13,686
So if the House and Senate actually ever pass a budget before December 31st, which does happen, right?

530
00:54:15,227 --> 00:54:16,308
Maybe, once in a while.

531
00:54:18,230 --> 00:54:19,231
June 30th, what did I say?

532
00:54:20,428 --> 00:54:21,329
You said December 31st.

533
00:54:21,369 --> 00:54:22,410
I meant June 30.

534
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:26,853
I don't think they've ever done it before December 31st, so I know those numbers.

535
00:54:26,873 --> 00:54:32,197
Sorry, I did mean June 30.

536
00:54:32,297 --> 00:54:39,622
All of our documentation, all of our budget can be done and signed off before they have actually... They've actually finalized the numbers.

537
00:54:39,662 --> 00:54:40,623
Yes, that can happen.

538
00:54:40,863 --> 00:54:41,003
Good.

539
00:54:41,263 --> 00:54:44,666
I assume that's what we do in years when they're working in July.

540
00:54:45,647 --> 00:54:49,329
And when they're working in July and...

541
00:54:51,022 --> 00:54:52,123
we get more money.

542
00:54:52,864 --> 00:54:56,607
That just is that just comes in and it's just excess.

543
00:54:56,667 --> 00:54:58,008
Or does that go into a specific?

544
00:54:58,088 --> 00:54:59,929
It just goes into the general fund.

545
00:55:00,309 --> 00:55:00,630
Sorry.

546
00:55:01,610 --> 00:55:04,192
Put on my long distance goggles.

547
00:55:05,053 --> 00:55:10,117
Um, that's just general revenue of the city, so it would go to the general fund.

548
00:55:10,397 --> 00:55:17,542
And, um, if Everything works out correctly, that falls to free cash for that fiscal year.

549
00:55:18,163 --> 00:55:18,423
Thank you.

550
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:34,534
I can't remember if they actually agreed to it last year or not, but last year there was at least an attempt to have a consensus on the local aid figures before June 30th, even though the final budget hasn't passed.

551
00:55:34,654 --> 00:55:38,938
I don't remember if that was just a request that the MMA put out or if they actually managed to do that.

552
00:55:38,958 --> 00:55:41,000
Nina's shaking.

553
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:41,721
I can't remember either.

554
00:55:44,331 --> 00:55:50,603
that has been something that they've tried to do in the past to give us a little bit more certainty, or that we've at least asked for.

555
00:55:50,623 --> 00:55:53,127
And is that you, Erica?

556
00:55:53,168 --> 00:55:53,288
Yes.

557
00:55:55,330 --> 00:55:55,690
Thank you.

558
00:55:56,351 --> 00:55:57,412
Thank you for the presentation.

559
00:55:57,432 --> 00:56:00,034
It was I found it clear.

560
00:56:00,054 --> 00:56:02,036
I had to look up a few words, but not too many.

561
00:56:02,156 --> 00:56:02,696
So thank you.

562
00:56:03,597 --> 00:56:05,459
I have a hyper local local question.

563
00:56:05,559 --> 00:56:12,665
I'm wondering if on the city side, we're going to see some non standard increases in departments.

564
00:56:12,705 --> 00:56:15,728
My understanding is some of the city departments

565
00:56:17,966 --> 00:56:23,455
We're a little restrained last time in order to fill some gaps in the school budget, which I very much appreciate.

566
00:56:23,736 --> 00:56:27,021
And I'm wondering if we're going to see those come back of people who

567
00:56:29,512 --> 00:56:32,893
unevenly increasing within the city?

568
00:56:32,933 --> 00:56:34,433
That might be a question for the mayor.

569
00:56:34,453 --> 00:56:48,976
It might also be premature, but I know some of the departments in the city, I don't wanna say sacrificed, but their ask wasn't as big because we had some significant gaps in the school budget to fill.

570
00:56:48,996 --> 00:56:57,958
And I know the override covered some of those, but I'm curious what the impact is gonna be on the allocations.

571
00:56:59,399 --> 00:57:14,281
I can answer that a member member Reinfeld is best I can now Nina, and I, after Courtney has kind of gathered the budgets together Courtney's our budget director, are starting to meet with each department head and understand

572
00:57:15,162 --> 00:57:33,190
Those types of scenarios, because it wasn't just last year that we pulled from the city to help better fund the schools I think it's a priority of the Council myself in the schools to fund our in the school committee to make sure our schools are funded properly to make sure our libraries funded properly.

573
00:57:34,050 --> 00:57:48,297
But having said that, I thank you for asking the question because, yes, we have had tough budget side on the city side with people that were upset because they couldn't do or the things they wanted to do.

574
00:57:48,377 --> 00:57:54,800
So we're going to take a hard look and see what can be added while at the same time still trying to prioritize our schools.

575
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:57,681
We're very lucky to have that override pass.

576
00:57:58,362 --> 00:58:00,803
But I still, even though schools have a number,

577
00:58:01,223 --> 00:58:09,415
If there's additional funding which I always try, we always try to do, we want to make sure we meet the needs of the schools that's just important piece of puzzle.

578
00:58:10,396 --> 00:58:17,426
So yes, it's a balance, and we have 25 departments, and we are going to try to first add back some of the things we had to cut.

579
00:58:17,926 --> 00:58:21,607
and then see what room there is to maybe grow in a few spots.

580
00:58:21,967 --> 00:58:30,449
And we always know we can usually add a position or two, and there's a long list of 20 plus positions that are needed within the departments.

581
00:58:30,509 --> 00:58:43,152
But I think Nina and I have, and our CFO, have a good pulse on how the departments are operating and which ones need to see a little more growth in that 1%, 2%, 3%, and which ones

582
00:58:44,872 --> 00:58:45,892
can sustain.

583
00:58:46,072 --> 00:58:47,433
So it's a work in progress.

584
00:58:47,493 --> 00:58:57,655
We hope to finish those meetings by the end of April so that we can prepare and get the council their budget beginning in May, which is I think in the budget ordinance first week in May.

585
00:58:58,015 --> 00:58:59,176
So it's still a work in progress.

586
00:58:59,596 --> 00:58:59,976
Thank you.

587
00:59:00,016 --> 00:59:07,158
And then, of course, there's the outstanding question that I know nobody can answer about what the federal landscape is going to look like and what

588
00:59:08,478 --> 00:59:13,001
is going to come or not come to the city, what compensations the states have.

589
00:59:13,021 --> 00:59:28,149
And of course, we'll be talking with the school finance director about contingencies and what things look like within the school budget, because we get obviously a lot of federal grants and a lot of federal aid and questions around, is this going to be a

590
00:59:29,409 --> 00:59:40,512
if we end up, find ourselves with less money, is this going to be an across the board reduction or is it going to be targeted to particular areas if we have to make those decisions, which I very much hope we don't, of course.

591
00:59:41,292 --> 00:59:43,293
But just recognizing that on the floor.

592
00:59:45,573 --> 00:59:45,853
Correct.

593
00:59:45,873 --> 00:59:56,496
And if the state is going to budget conservatively from what I understood from my meetings yesterday, in case they need to plug gaps like Medicaid, which will be in the billions, then

594
00:59:58,005 --> 01:00:01,968
it's a guessing game of what the state's gonna cover and what the cities and towns are gonna have to cover.

595
01:00:02,388 --> 01:00:07,312
So it could be substantial and we're just praying and hoping that it is not.

596
01:00:08,773 --> 01:00:09,133
Thank you.

597
01:00:17,559 --> 01:00:19,741
Any questions from members of the council at this time?

598
01:00:19,761 --> 01:00:25,165
I have a couple.

599
01:00:25,825 --> 01:00:26,286
Okay.

600
01:00:29,165 --> 01:00:35,851
Bob, the pension applications are based on the actuarial schedule, right?

601
01:00:35,911 --> 01:00:36,171
Yes.

602
01:00:36,391 --> 01:00:37,792
And that's fully funded in 2033?

603
01:00:37,952 --> 01:00:38,272
It's 2033 now.

604
01:00:38,373 --> 01:00:40,414
That'll be a good year.

605
01:00:40,614 --> 01:00:40,774
Yes.

606
01:00:45,799 --> 01:00:46,820
Don't forget about open.

607
01:00:47,461 --> 01:00:48,041
Yeah, exactly.

608
01:00:48,262 --> 01:00:57,073
So, yeah, that's what a lot of cities and towns are doing that they're fully funding the pension obligations are required to be fully funded by 2040.

609
01:00:59,676 --> 01:01:03,801
But Parag the pension agency would really like them to be.

610
01:01:04,522 --> 01:01:04,882
that we should be.

611
01:01:05,002 --> 01:01:08,864
Funded much sooner than that, and we're even sooner than that.

612
01:01:09,184 --> 01:01:11,125
That's 2033 that we should be.

613
01:01:12,005 --> 01:01:13,886
Um we should be fully funded.

614
01:01:14,967 --> 01:01:17,248
And that the excess.

615
01:01:18,128 --> 01:01:19,088
Off the top of my head.

616
01:01:19,148 --> 01:01:22,270
I think that will save the city something like $20 million a year.

617
01:01:22,290 --> 01:01:27,172
Um but at that point, we should be funding taking a significant

618
01:01:34,095 --> 01:01:38,097
And they're going to come up with some sort of similar program and schedule for that.

619
01:01:38,117 --> 01:01:42,520
Yeah, well, it's not, I don't think it's required yet, but it's a good idea.

620
01:01:45,262 --> 01:01:50,465
So hopefully once we get all that done, these programs should be self-sustaining.

621
01:01:53,741 --> 01:01:54,161
So 20, 60, 20.

622
01:01:57,024 --> 01:02:03,969
I doubt I'll actually live to see it, but it's good to keep pushing at it.

623
01:02:04,589 --> 01:02:10,814
The ACFRS for fiscal 23 and 24, when will those be available?

624
01:02:10,834 --> 01:02:12,776
The 2023 is on the website right now.

625
01:02:12,816 --> 01:02:14,897
And 2024, I have to review it tomorrow.

626
01:02:21,274 --> 01:02:25,498
I'm the last person to actually have to review it, but we have it in hand.

627
01:02:25,598 --> 01:02:38,808
And once I review it and say, this is great, I sign the transmittal letter and we get the final document and that will go right on the website and be sent out.

628
01:02:39,429 --> 01:02:39,689
Great.

629
01:02:41,170 --> 01:02:48,156
It's the combined financial comprehensive annual comprehensive financial report.

630
01:02:48,656 --> 01:02:56,782
Yeah, it's the 100 something page document that, yeah, shows all of the annual audits, how everything was calculated, fund balances.

631
01:02:56,802 --> 01:03:01,805
So actually really helpful read to understand everything the city does.

632
01:03:03,286 --> 01:03:06,208
Or if you have insomnia, it's very useful document.

633
01:03:06,689 --> 01:03:08,210
Keeps me up at night, I'll tell you that.

634
01:03:08,230 --> 01:03:11,452
It would, wouldn't it?

635
01:03:12,733 --> 01:03:14,814
But I just think it's useful for people to know that.

636
01:03:16,497 --> 01:03:21,441
that document shows essentially down to the dollar, where the money of the city goes.

637
01:03:22,141 --> 01:03:30,908
And it's a level of accounting that most institutions, businesses, and others in this country are not asked to, you know, meet.

638
01:03:31,688 --> 01:03:36,191
So, you know, even in the nonprofit industry that I'm in, there's, you know, a 2%.

639
01:03:40,254 --> 01:03:44,417
Basically, if it's 2% off, that's pretty much fine, is the general rule.

640
01:03:46,362 --> 01:03:50,385
Some organizations choose to go down to the dollar, but cities and towns have to.

641
01:03:50,445 --> 01:03:52,186
It has to be independently audited every year.

642
01:03:52,206 --> 01:03:55,048
And these reports show exactly where every dollar went.

643
01:03:55,868 --> 01:04:03,853
And I just think that's valuable information for people to understand that those are the standards that municipalities are held to and we meet those standards.

644
01:04:03,993 --> 01:04:05,174
So thank you for the work on it.

645
01:04:05,647 --> 01:04:05,847
Yeah.

646
01:04:06,427 --> 01:04:10,748
And again, these are all available on the city's website in the finance department.

647
01:04:11,328 --> 01:04:12,668
Going back many, many years.

648
01:04:13,109 --> 01:04:15,629
You can see where we were in 2019.

649
01:04:16,289 --> 01:04:18,690
If you would like to so Great.

650
01:04:19,310 --> 01:04:25,311
Um, my last, uh, request of a council member if they could just make a motion.

651
01:04:26,331 --> 01:04:27,672
Just to request that, um

652
01:04:35,304 --> 01:04:46,763
the 25 estimate and the 26 proposed slash estimate motion by councillor Callahan seconded by seconded by councillor Lazaro.

653
01:04:47,744 --> 01:04:48,966
Mr. Clerk when you have the motion

654
01:05:12,452 --> 01:05:12,892
You call the roll.

655
01:05:13,312 --> 01:05:13,912
Councilor Callahan.

656
01:05:15,773 --> 01:05:16,593
Vice President Collins.

657
01:05:17,173 --> 01:05:17,393
Yes.

658
01:05:18,234 --> 01:05:18,954
Councilor Lozaro.

659
01:05:18,974 --> 01:05:19,074
Yes.

660
01:05:19,654 --> 01:05:20,194
Councilor Lemming.

661
01:05:22,255 --> 01:05:22,315
No.

662
01:05:22,375 --> 01:05:24,936
We weren't expecting to get a dog at the time.

663
01:05:26,396 --> 01:05:27,156
Councilor Skarpelic.

664
01:05:27,596 --> 01:05:27,936
Yes.

665
01:05:28,236 --> 01:05:28,577
Sorry.

666
01:05:30,517 --> 01:05:30,797
Yes.

667
01:05:32,038 --> 01:05:32,578
President Paris.

668
01:05:32,798 --> 01:05:32,998
Yes.

669
01:05:33,098 --> 01:05:34,778
I mean for when the negative motion passes.

670
01:05:37,439 --> 01:05:38,139
It was just for us.

671
01:05:38,299 --> 01:05:40,300
Do you, do you want to, you don't have to.

672
01:05:41,750 --> 01:05:43,551
Members of the school committee, is there a motion?

673
01:05:43,571 --> 01:05:46,993
No motion from the school committee.

674
01:05:47,393 --> 01:05:47,513
Okay.

675
01:05:48,934 --> 01:05:52,376
We'll send it to you.

676
01:05:54,678 --> 01:05:54,958
Great.

677
01:05:56,399 --> 01:05:57,639
Is that what your mic was on for?

678
01:05:57,659 --> 01:05:59,060
Great.

679
01:06:01,281 --> 01:06:03,883
Is there anything else that you'd like to share at this time?

680
01:06:06,468 --> 01:06:15,070
No, we're up to date on the audits and we're working hard on the budgets and we'll be back.

681
01:06:15,750 --> 01:06:18,211
Oh, we'll be seeing lots of you the next three months.

682
01:06:18,311 --> 01:06:21,012
It's our time to see you every week.

683
01:06:21,412 --> 01:06:22,232
Yeah.

684
01:06:22,332 --> 01:06:22,592
Almost.

685
01:06:23,432 --> 01:06:33,855
And as always, if you have specific questions and if you're in the building, my door is always open or send me an email and I will attempt to get the information that you need.

686
01:06:36,597 --> 01:06:37,398
Thank you, Director.

687
01:06:37,738 --> 01:06:39,479
I'll turn it over to Vice Chair Graham.

688
01:06:41,401 --> 01:06:41,821
Thank you.

689
01:06:41,981 --> 01:06:44,743
Are there any other questions from the school committee?

690
01:06:47,758 --> 01:06:56,560
I just wanted to say thank you, Director Dickinson and Nina for obliging us and helping put this meeting together.

691
01:06:56,580 --> 01:07:15,985
I think it's really important that we all hear a picture of what the city's finances are, so I'm really glad that we're here doing this, creating a space to talk plainly about the plain numbers, even though there's lots of them, so that when people have questions, there's a place that we can point them to to say,

692
01:07:18,065 --> 01:07:24,769
We collectively, as the elected officials in Medford, are proactively asking for this information and getting this information.

693
01:07:24,869 --> 01:07:34,795
And to President Bares' point, there's an incredible amount of accounting and detail that has to be provided in the spirit of transparency.

694
01:07:34,835 --> 01:07:36,696
So I think that's always really important to reinforce.

695
01:07:37,797 --> 01:07:39,818
So I'm just glad that we're here.

696
01:07:39,838 --> 01:07:42,300
I'm glad that it's only been about an hour.

697
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:45,782
And I just wanted to say thank you.

698
01:07:46,462 --> 01:07:47,324
Well, you're welcome.

699
01:07:47,364 --> 01:07:47,865
And thank you.

700
01:07:48,046 --> 01:07:48,927
Thank you for listening.

701
01:07:56,402 --> 01:07:57,084
Okay.

702
01:07:58,973 --> 01:07:59,994
We do.

703
01:08:00,154 --> 01:08:01,515
We do have to adjourn twice.

704
01:08:01,915 --> 01:08:07,619
So there's a motion from the school committee to adjourn by Mr. Sorry, I'm sorry.

705
01:08:07,639 --> 01:08:08,820
Go ahead.

706
01:08:09,140 --> 01:08:12,342
I would before we before we adjourn.

707
01:08:12,402 --> 01:08:21,228
I think that if Chair Graham and President bears would sing happy birthday to school can remember john and topper, I think would be a fitting way to end.

708
01:08:21,989 --> 01:08:22,729
Um, thank you.

709
01:08:23,049 --> 01:08:23,830
Oh, my God.

710
01:08:26,624 --> 01:08:33,566
You can motion to not accept the song number on top of it.

711
01:08:33,766 --> 01:08:34,326
It doesn't work.

712
01:08:36,487 --> 01:08:37,387
Is it just the two of us?

713
01:08:37,447 --> 01:08:38,627
I think it's just the two of us.

714
01:08:39,368 --> 01:08:42,048
John, you have to go on video so we can see, you'd be embarrassed.

715
01:08:42,228 --> 01:08:42,729
No, okay.

716
01:08:42,789 --> 01:08:43,849
Happy birthday to you.

717
01:08:52,610 --> 01:08:55,371
Happy birthday to you.

718
01:08:55,391 --> 01:08:59,652
Happy birthday dear Tompa.

719
01:08:59,712 --> 01:09:02,212
Happy birthday to you.

720
01:09:02,232 --> 01:09:02,292
Yay.

721
01:09:04,313 --> 01:09:06,053
Oh, was I unmuted for that?

722
01:09:06,073 --> 01:09:08,414
Sorry, I'm yelling at my dad because he said something about it.

723
01:09:09,974 --> 01:09:10,495
Thank you.

724
01:09:10,795 --> 01:09:11,675
Thank you very much.

725
01:09:11,715 --> 01:09:12,535
I appreciate it.

726
01:09:13,935 --> 01:09:16,936
And it's not, I'm not there because I'm gonna smile about my birthday.

727
01:09:16,956 --> 01:09:20,137
I'm not there because I just got back from New Orleans from a conference, so.

728
01:09:21,912 --> 01:09:25,934
Thank you everyone for doing the work and for meeting today and talking about the budget.

729
01:09:27,515 --> 01:09:27,735
Thank you.

730
01:09:27,795 --> 01:09:30,836
And I will just say, I'm not there for my birthday because I was in New Orleans.

731
01:09:30,856 --> 01:09:33,357
It doesn't sound exactly the way, maybe.

732
01:09:33,698 --> 01:09:35,779
Zach, will you please explain to this kid?

733
01:09:35,819 --> 01:09:36,739
Please explain to him.

734
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:44,202
They need emergency foot surgery, but not, you know.

735
01:09:44,523 --> 01:09:45,323
That's your motion.

736
01:09:45,743 --> 01:09:48,805
So the school committee has a motion to adjourn by member Reinfeld.

737
01:09:48,825 --> 01:09:49,385
Is there a second?

738
01:09:50,477 --> 01:09:51,938
seconded by Member Olopade.

739
01:09:52,878 --> 01:09:53,859
Member Rousseau, can you call the roll?

Mayor Longo, I believe is absent.

752
01:10:11,747 --> 01:10:13,268
Six in the affirmative, one absent.

753
01:10:13,288 --> 01:10:13,968
The motion passes.

754
01:10:15,007 --> 01:10:15,947
Is there a motion to adjourn?

755
01:10:16,768 --> 01:10:19,489
Motion by Councilor Lazaro to adjourn, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

756
01:10:19,529 --> 01:10:20,569

Vice President Collins.

759
01:10:30,932 --> 01:10:31,233
Yes.

760

Yes.

768
01:10:42,421 --> 01:10:43,623
Six in the affirmative, one in the negative.

769
01:10:43,643 --> 01:10:45,446
The motion passes and the meeting is adjourned.
