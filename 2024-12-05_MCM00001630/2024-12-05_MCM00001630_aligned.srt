1
00:00:00,715 --> 00:00:03,197
All right, well, I will call the meeting to order.

2
00:00:03,257 --> 00:00:13,243
This is the meeting of Medford's Community Preservation Committee on Tuesday, November 12th, 2024, 6.30 p.m.

3
00:00:13,323 --> 00:00:15,024
We're actually starting a little bit late.

4
00:00:15,105 --> 00:00:20,088
I will acknowledge it's about, oh, just 6.35 p.m., we're not that late.

5
00:00:22,031 --> 00:00:36,678
And the meeting is being held via hybrid means so members of the public may participate either in room 201 of Medford City Hall or via Zoom.

6
00:00:37,907 --> 00:00:51,214
And with that, I will invite, we have on the agenda this evening, an application presentation for the Medford Movement Assistance Program from ABCD.

7
00:00:51,815 --> 00:00:54,776
So do we have a representative from ABCD?

8
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:56,017
Yes, I'm here.

9
00:00:56,998 --> 00:00:57,538
Welcome.

10
00:00:57,558 --> 00:00:59,239
Thank you for joining us.

11
00:00:59,619 --> 00:01:01,320
And why don't you tell us about your project?

12
00:01:01,789 --> 00:01:04,171
Yes, so my name is Tondo Dube.

13
00:01:04,591 --> 00:01:07,754
I am the deputy director of housing at ABCD.

14
00:01:07,774 --> 00:01:13,279
And we would like to present the Medford Move-In project.

15
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:17,602
So Medford Move-In is a project we've worked on with you all since 2021.

16
00:01:17,722 --> 00:01:22,967
We essentially provide first month's rent, last month's rent,

17
00:01:23,467 --> 00:01:29,408
essentially move in costs and move in support to residents moving into the Medford area.

18
00:01:29,949 --> 00:01:33,049
All of the residents we serve are low income residents.

19
00:01:33,149 --> 00:01:49,693
They're at or below 100% of the area median income, and we essentially support them so that they don't face as many barriers when they're moving into the city, hopefully then maintaining a long tenancy with the city.

20
00:01:53,873 --> 00:01:55,294
Thank you very much.

21
00:01:55,454 --> 00:01:58,717
And so I see that your application you have requesting $99,989.

22
00:01:58,838 --> 00:01:59,038
Yes.

23
00:01:59,138 --> 00:02:04,403
And this includes, I see, I think I understand administrative costs that add up to $23,988.

24
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,943
And then I think you had 76,000 was the actual program delivery costs.

25
00:02:24,563 --> 00:02:24,843
Yes.

26
00:02:24,903 --> 00:02:26,744
So we have program delivery costs.

27
00:02:26,804 --> 00:02:32,346
We also have some salary costs in there to support the staff members working on the program.

28
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:42,289
We have some program supply costs to support marketing, distribution of flyers so that folks are aware of the program as well.

29
00:02:42,709 --> 00:02:43,630
We have a little bit of

30
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:47,312
office supplies and various items as well.

31
00:02:47,372 --> 00:02:53,977
And then a few, a small percentage of that as our indirect for our kind of financial team overhead costs.

32
00:02:56,579 --> 00:02:59,241
Thank you for that confirmation.

33
00:02:59,301 --> 00:03:03,324
So all of that is included in the what I calculated is $23,988.

34
00:03:05,465 --> 00:03:06,366
Yes, that's correct.

35
00:03:07,667 --> 00:03:07,907
Great.

36
00:03:08,047 --> 00:03:10,409
Are there questions from committee members?

37
00:03:17,998 --> 00:03:20,021
I have a question.

38
00:03:20,421 --> 00:03:22,904
I was looking at the move-in log.

39
00:03:23,184 --> 00:03:33,096
It looks like it's an image, not an Excel spreadsheet, which is fine, but I can't tell what the total amount is once I get my calculator out.

40
00:03:33,637 --> 00:03:37,421
But I think I had asked for what the total was that we awarded thus far.

41
00:03:38,182 --> 00:03:48,147
Yes, so far we've spent $35,354, and that excludes the returned check that you'll see there.

42
00:03:48,447 --> 00:03:50,628
And then this year of that was $16,229.

43
00:03:50,808 --> 00:04:00,533
I was just gonna say, how much have we awarded?

44
00:04:00,593 --> 00:04:01,954
That's 35 spent.

45
00:04:01,994 --> 00:04:02,994
How much have we awarded?

46
00:04:03,014 --> 00:04:03,915
Do you remember, Teresa?

47
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:08,833
We've awarded 2 awards, 30 and then a 60,000.

48
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:13,674
So, in total, they've received 90,000 so far over multiple years and multiple awards.

49
00:04:14,474 --> 00:04:18,475
So, this would be their 3rd award in this program.

50
00:04:19,315 --> 00:04:24,316
So, the difference between what has been spent and what has been awarded, where is that?

51
00:04:24,857 --> 00:04:26,337
Is it sitting in, where is that?

52
00:04:27,115 --> 00:04:31,116
Yes, I'm trying to figure out where that works in with this amount that you're asking for.

53
00:04:31,476 --> 00:04:33,656
Yes, this is the current amount.

54
00:04:33,676 --> 00:04:40,638
So we still are actively spending that as well, actively taking applications for folks moving into the city of Medford.

55
00:04:41,158 --> 00:04:46,459
And our goal is to be able to continue the project as well with additional funds.

56
00:04:51,174 --> 00:04:55,075
Of that $35,000, that's from the $60,000 award.

57
00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:57,516
So they still have a bank to spend down.

58
00:04:57,536 --> 00:05:00,077
Does that clarify your question, Joan?

59
00:05:00,777 --> 00:05:06,779
Yeah, I'm trying to figure out where the dollars are being spent and how they're getting expended.

60
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,100
So I'm trying to figure out the amount that it's asked for now.

61
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:17,642
Is additional required beyond the extra money that you haven't spent so far?

62
00:05:18,258 --> 00:05:24,402
Yes, so the amount that we're asking for in this application will be for the future three year period.

63
00:05:26,483 --> 00:05:29,525
Three year period, so we're not going to see you back next year.

64
00:05:36,201 --> 00:05:39,444
Actually, my questions were pretty much in line with what Joan was asking.

65
00:05:39,484 --> 00:05:47,731
I was going to ask what previous requests were and how that money was spent down, if it was spent down.

66
00:05:47,831 --> 00:05:54,036
So basically, bottom line is you have about 90-ish thousand in the pot in your bank right now.

67
00:05:54,156 --> 00:05:54,617
You spent 35.

68
00:05:56,138 --> 00:06:00,061
You're asking for an additional 99 to just use in fiscal year 25 or like,

69
00:06:02,268 --> 00:06:07,192
no deadline, like just give us 100 and we'll see how far we can go with it type thing or?

70
00:06:07,713 --> 00:06:09,935
We'd love to spend it in the next three years.

71
00:06:10,035 --> 00:06:13,818
So our request, I believe was fiscal year 25 to 28.

72
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:20,964
But our goal is that we will continue to spend down in the meantime, as well.

73
00:06:21,044 --> 00:06:25,348
We've done a lot more marketing this year, and pushing the program.

74
00:06:25,368 --> 00:06:29,912
So our hope is that folks will really engage with the program, the more the word is out, I think,

75
00:06:30,252 --> 00:06:31,833
some of the trouble with spending.

76
00:06:31,873 --> 00:06:33,074
We just faced some barriers.

77
00:06:33,134 --> 00:06:37,156
Folks weren't aware of the program, weren't aware of the services being provided.

78
00:06:37,556 --> 00:06:42,298
And so we've really been able to push that this year, and we hope that that continues to increase in the future.

79
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:45,080
And this started during COVID, is that correct?

80
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:46,400
Started in 2021.

81
00:06:47,661 --> 00:06:47,961
Okay.

82
00:06:48,501 --> 00:06:51,463
And like, do you have an average amount, like you help on a monthly basis?

83
00:06:51,503 --> 00:06:54,725
Does it hit more in like the winter Christmas time?

84
00:06:54,825 --> 00:06:56,445
Like, or is it pretty even?

85
00:06:56,786 --> 00:06:57,406
Like, what do you see?

86
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:03,833
We do see, we tend to see folks reach out a lot more winter time and then also September 1st.

87
00:07:03,913 --> 00:07:07,815
It's just a very popular move-in date around this area.

88
00:07:08,035 --> 00:07:11,758
Some of the barriers we face with folks are just not turning in documents.

89
00:07:12,638 --> 00:07:17,120
I think the other thing that we see is folks are very interested in security deposits.

90
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,841
So we do first and last month's rent.

91
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:25,325
We've noticed folks reach out for security deposit as well and maybe also have other ways to get this funding.

92
00:07:26,265 --> 00:07:28,066
if they're not utilizing this program.

93
00:07:29,367 --> 00:07:32,529
Do you have rules for, like, do you only help a person one time?

94
00:07:32,709 --> 00:07:34,410
Is there a max amount you help them with?

95
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:38,292
Yes, right now we've only been helping folks once at a time.

96
00:07:38,733 --> 00:07:40,434
We have not capped it.

97
00:07:40,514 --> 00:07:49,659
We internally capped it at about 5,004 folks, but most of the time folks won't hit that amount since it's first and last month, not first last in security.

98
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:53,501
We don't hope folks move again, or we haven't so far.

99
00:07:55,322 --> 00:07:59,465
But that's something that we could definitely discuss and talk through as well.

100
00:08:00,306 --> 00:08:07,631
But definitely most of the folks that we see are also a mix between folks that we serve with our housing counseling program.

101
00:08:07,651 --> 00:08:10,974
So we do housing search with folks in-house as well.

102
00:08:11,594 --> 00:08:15,097
We have a homeless outreach team that serves Medford as well.

103
00:08:15,698 --> 00:08:20,101
And so a portion of these folks come directly through our systems.

104
00:08:20,481 --> 00:08:26,406
and then some other folks doing various tabling events or outreach events that we interact with residents.

105
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:32,411
And I assume you help with like rent arrears like to avoid evictions and stuff like that.

106
00:08:32,451 --> 00:08:42,600
Yeah so we have a separate Medford program as well where we serve Medford residents with rent arrears and for all of the programs we won't serve folks who are rent burdened so

107
00:08:43,101 --> 00:08:52,068
If somebody's paying more than 50% of their income towards the rent, we wouldn't allow them to lease up with this program because the goal is that they'll stay leased and stay in Medford long-term.

108
00:08:52,088 --> 00:08:53,409
Yeah, that's good.

109
00:08:53,809 --> 00:08:54,309
Okay, thank you.

110
00:08:57,892 --> 00:09:00,314
I have a couple more questions that come up for me.

111
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:12,743
First, following up on what you just described, you said that you do have a rent arrears program for Medford residents.

112
00:09:13,532 --> 00:09:19,614
Is that funded by CPA or that's funded by, okay, what program is funding that right now?

113
00:09:19,894 --> 00:09:24,936
Yeah, so we get CDBG funding from the city for our rental arrear program in Medford.

114
00:09:25,697 --> 00:09:26,817
Okay, that's good to know.

115
00:09:28,678 --> 00:09:35,280
Yeah, it's pretty common, like we fund, CPA funds ABCD as well as housing families.

116
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,841
CDBG does the other thing on the other side.

117
00:09:37,861 --> 00:09:41,583
So we're like a financing sandwich for those two organizations.

118
00:09:42,043 --> 00:09:42,163
Yeah.

119
00:09:43,058 --> 00:09:56,907
Okay, and the other question I had, so was the table that was provided in this application material, is that table only showing how you spend the FY, the 2020 grant of 60,000, or is it also the 2019 grant of 30,000?

120
00:09:57,007 --> 00:10:00,390
It was the, let me double check.

121
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:13,833
was the 2020 60,000.

122
00:10:13,973 --> 00:10:19,195
So it didn't include the first initial but it that was the 60,000 that we've spent.

123
00:10:19,935 --> 00:10:23,836
So did you fully spend down the first initial 30,000 already?

124
00:10:25,236 --> 00:10:25,476
Yes.

125
00:10:27,017 --> 00:10:34,698
Okay, so what you've done, okay, so that was a little bit of like, we're, I think we didn't all make that connection.

126
00:10:34,858 --> 00:10:36,919
So you have actually spent

127
00:10:37,812 --> 00:10:42,854
$65,000 in total out of the total $90,000 that we've given you so far.

128
00:10:43,415 --> 00:10:46,896
Yes, we currently have the remaining amount in the bank was just released.

129
00:10:46,956 --> 00:10:54,820
I think something else to note was that you all released to us after we spend about $30,000 each time, but you didn't release it to us all at once.

130
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:59,922
So we recently received the next, the remaining $30,000 from you all.

131
00:11:01,463 --> 00:11:01,883
Got it.

132
00:11:02,443 --> 00:11:05,845
And did the previous grants include the

133
00:11:07,015 --> 00:11:12,517
Um, program delivery, the administrative cost, um, portion.

134
00:11:12,537 --> 00:11:18,720
I don't believe they, I don't need to speak for you, but I don't believe that they did.

135
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:23,262
This was something that we had discussed as a team to introduce to help support the program.

136
00:11:24,062 --> 00:11:24,262
Yeah.

137
00:11:24,502 --> 00:11:24,782
Okay.

138
00:11:24,802 --> 00:11:26,303
So I just wanted to be clear about that.

139
00:11:26,443 --> 00:11:30,785
And I, I, if that helps you to get the word out and to actually spread

140
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:34,471
get more Medford families enrolled.

141
00:11:34,772 --> 00:11:38,216
I support using the funds for that purpose.

142
00:11:38,536 --> 00:11:50,210
One bit of feedback that I heard anecdotally over the past year was someone who had received a Section 8 voucher from Medford Housing Authority

143
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:57,933
was not able to afford the moving costs for an apartment that they found in Medford.

144
00:11:58,053 --> 00:12:02,116
And so they ended up having to give up their voucher and move elsewhere.

145
00:12:02,136 --> 00:12:09,040
And so that's really disappointing to hear because this program exists to help them specifically.

146
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:20,527
So I wonder whether you have any collaboration or partnership with the Medford Housing Authority to make sure that there's

147
00:12:22,249 --> 00:12:29,035
that people who are receiving vouchers in Medford know that this program is there to help them?

148
00:12:30,016 --> 00:12:31,778
Yes, we do a little bit of both.

149
00:12:31,798 --> 00:12:40,926
So folks can come to us from Medford Housing Authority and other organizations to do the housing search.

150
00:12:40,946 --> 00:12:45,310
So we'll support with housing search for families looking to move within Medford.

151
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:47,131
area as well.

152
00:12:47,311 --> 00:12:59,738
And then we do try to hang flyers when we do have them available at the Housing Authority and talk to folks there to let them know that the program exists, and it's available for their residents.

153
00:12:59,898 --> 00:13:05,062
I think a challenge that we have talked about with you all in the past is just the

154
00:13:06,002 --> 00:13:17,726
maybe additional security deposit or security deposit funds, because we see that voucher holders, their first month we can support them with, their last month oftentimes the voucher will cover.

155
00:13:18,106 --> 00:13:31,630
And so the additional balance that they're looking for is really that security deposit as well, or a broker's fee, which we haven't implemented in the program so far, but we've been talking about making that a possibility in the future.

156
00:13:33,023 --> 00:14:00,795
Yeah, unfortunately, we were advised in the beginning when we originally set up this program that security deposits are very difficult to pay for with public funds because it's ambiguous who the money has to go back to after the end of the tenancy and keeping track of the tenants years after they moved in.

157
00:14:01,437 --> 00:14:07,098
so that the money can be recovered that's supposed to come back to the city is really difficult.

158
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:12,920
And the money is intended to go towards their apartment and not to the tenants themselves.

159
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:16,981
So making it a grant to the tenant wouldn't work for us.

160
00:14:17,281 --> 00:14:25,383
So that's the reason why it was determined that we could really only cover the first and last month's rent.

161
00:14:31,685 --> 00:14:33,887
Are there other questions from committee members?

162
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:37,190
So curious.

163
00:14:38,851 --> 00:14:45,497
I know that this is the first time that you're requesting personnel charge funds.

164
00:14:45,857 --> 00:14:48,779
How was the personnel being funded previously?

165
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:50,641
Or is this to hire new personnel?

166
00:14:51,172 --> 00:14:54,234
This is to hire already existing personnel.

167
00:14:54,374 --> 00:15:02,279
So we do have general ABCD funds that we've been using for folks working on this project.

168
00:15:02,679 --> 00:15:14,327
So this won't cover full salaries for anybody, but just to supplement some of the project time that they work on approving applications, reviewing applications, collecting documents for folks.

169
00:15:17,031 --> 00:15:30,261
I'm trying to figure out if this is not for new people, is the funds that normally supported them going to be used for additional help for the client?

170
00:15:30,865 --> 00:15:42,072
Yeah, so we would use that funding to then support some of our other housing programs as well that are still able to support Medford residents.

171
00:15:42,092 --> 00:15:52,219
So we can then use the funds to really push towards housing counseling more, which is our program that provides the affordable housing search for folks and things of that nature.

172
00:15:52,299 --> 00:15:56,362
Right now, we've kind of used that funding to supplement this project.

173
00:15:57,282 --> 00:15:57,562
I see.

174
00:15:58,103 --> 00:15:58,363
Thank you.

175
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:05,493
Other questions?

176
00:16:10,776 --> 00:16:14,898
Well, thank you so much, Tando, for joining us this evening.

177
00:16:14,938 --> 00:16:17,979
A lot of great information and discussion.

178
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:28,705
And so we'll continue with the committee's deliberation process and we'll let you know how it turns out.

179
00:16:29,605 --> 00:16:30,065
Perfect.

180
00:16:30,105 --> 00:16:30,485
Thank you.

181
00:16:30,505 --> 00:16:31,546
Thank you for having me.

182
00:16:32,246 --> 00:16:32,806
Thanks, Ellie.

183
00:16:38,233 --> 00:16:38,513
All right.

184
00:16:42,696 --> 00:16:43,156
So who is 7815267405?

185
00:16:43,857 --> 00:16:45,257
It's just a member of the public.

186
00:16:45,277 --> 00:16:45,358
Okay.

187
00:16:45,618 --> 00:16:48,700
Sometimes when somebody is on the phone,

188
00:17:02,385 --> 00:17:29,130
anybody's ever taken a zoom phone call over the phone it's uh maybe if you're able to change the name so that it says it's done i just want to make sure that we keep a clear record of who's talking thanks okay so the next on the agenda um the

189
00:17:32,068 --> 00:17:33,548
application deliberations.

190
00:17:34,329 --> 00:17:41,970
So it's kind of a little bit complicated how to approach the application deliberations.

191
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:53,493
The first thing I want to do is give a couple of updates that we can take into consideration as we go through our deliberations.

192
00:17:55,069 --> 00:18:04,554
So one is the administration request that was included in your meeting packet for FY 25 Riverside Plaza shade structure.

193
00:18:04,574 --> 00:18:05,655
They are

194
00:18:11,437 --> 00:18:38,324
The application has not changed in terms of the scope and budget, but they're asking for an expedited decision because the city is awarded a park grant and we have to, in order to accept the park grant, we have to appropriate the local matching funds for the park grant before the end of this year.

195
00:18:38,344 --> 00:18:40,165
And in order to do that,

196
00:18:40,793 --> 00:18:49,298
that they're requesting that we make a decision this evening whether to recommend CPA funds for that project.

197
00:18:49,898 --> 00:18:50,199
Doug?

198
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:51,319
Nope.

199
00:18:51,479 --> 00:18:52,760
That's disregard.

200
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:53,681
Never mind.

201
00:18:53,701 --> 00:18:54,361
OK.

202
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:57,103
So that was one update.

203
00:18:57,283 --> 00:19:09,750
I also wanted to just recall that Shiloh had asked for an expedited decision back in September.

204
00:19:10,677 --> 00:19:27,647
And so I thought that it might be fair to also consider whether to give them an early decision in line with the Riverside Plaza request.

205
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:38,673
So there are two projects that if we decide that the committee wants to recommend funding for those projects, we'll try to see if we have time to

206
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:42,092
actually make those two recommendations this evening.

207
00:19:42,112 --> 00:19:45,915
Shiloh was for the daycare center, right?

208
00:19:46,516 --> 00:19:49,518
Yes, that's correct, for the daycare center.

209
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:59,466
And so those are the updates relating to scheduling.

210
00:19:59,906 --> 00:20:08,593
And one other major update that I don't believe is reflected in any of the materials that are given in your meeting packet

211
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:24,391
is that very lately, as of today, the facilities director has requested that we switch.

212
00:20:24,531 --> 00:20:29,272
So the City Hall has a couple of emergency projects that are in the pipeline.

213
00:20:29,712 --> 00:20:35,093
One of them is the bathrooms project, which was presented to the committee last month.

214
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:40,498
And the other is restoration of the city hall chamber windows.

215
00:20:42,039 --> 00:20:54,993
And because the I raised the concern that because the city hall chamber windows are actually a more historically sensitive feature asset of the city hall building.

216
00:20:55,685 --> 00:21:07,474
It would make sense to use CPA funding to ensure that the project is completed according to the Secretary of Interior standards, and the bathrooms are less sensitive.

217
00:21:07,634 --> 00:21:13,899
Even though it's an eligible project, it's not as historically important to follow those standards.

218
00:21:14,499 --> 00:21:27,444
So the mayor, I had this conversation with the mayor and with city councilors, and the mayor requested that the facilities director switch the two requests.

219
00:21:27,704 --> 00:21:41,010
So they're now going to be pursuing the bathrooms out of the stability fund, and they're requesting from CPA restoration of the city hall chamber windows.

220
00:21:42,656 --> 00:21:54,000
And we were given an estimate with a budget for the City Hall windows, which Teresa will share with you.

221
00:21:54,060 --> 00:22:02,104
Yes, I'm also going to put it into the drop box for those who might be following along there, but I will also screen share it.

222
00:22:03,084 --> 00:22:10,887
So the ADA update restroom restoration application has been withdrawn?

223
00:22:13,304 --> 00:22:21,550
Um, yes, but the so they changed the scope entirely.

224
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:30,917
Otherwise, it's still the city applying still for City Hall, still the same staff who are making the application request.

225
00:22:31,538 --> 00:22:38,343
And it's still an urgent project, according to their, you know, for the same

226
00:22:39,084 --> 00:22:45,926
It's on the same timeline of urgency as the bathrooms, but obviously for different reasons.

227
00:22:47,687 --> 00:23:02,091
But yes, they would prefer to request funding for the windows out of CPA and do the bathrooms out of the stabilization fund as they were going to do it in the opposite order.

228
00:23:02,911 --> 00:23:04,952
So we don't have an application for the windows?

229
00:23:06,907 --> 00:23:09,848
We have an estimate for the windows is all that we have.

230
00:23:10,988 --> 00:23:13,088
But they haven't made a presentation or whatever.

231
00:23:14,108 --> 00:23:16,249
They just sent us a call and said we'd rather do this?

232
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:18,249
Yes.

233
00:23:19,489 --> 00:23:24,790
Do you think we should get them to come and do the application presentation as all others have?

234
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:28,131
Is there some emergency here?

235
00:23:31,791 --> 00:23:35,732
Let me take Ada's question and we'll see if

236
00:23:38,893 --> 00:23:43,658
I was less of a question and I mean, I actually kind of agree with Joan.

237
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:50,204
That I feel like they should come, but I just want to say, I'm really happy with this turn of events.

238
00:23:50,304 --> 00:23:52,166
I felt like it was a really bad precedent.

239
00:23:53,027 --> 00:23:56,029
For the PC to come in and they've.

240
00:23:57,075 --> 00:24:04,518
City Hall in this way, I'm glad that they're using different funds for that.

241
00:24:05,638 --> 00:24:13,582
I think this is a positive that we're actually going to be targeting something that is specifically historical.

242
00:24:15,042 --> 00:24:15,803
That's all I was going to say.

243
00:24:17,163 --> 00:24:17,683
Thank you.

244
00:24:18,004 --> 00:24:20,705
But I agree that I would love to see an actual presentation.

245
00:24:23,046 --> 00:24:23,946
What's the estimate on this?

246
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:26,640
Uh, 3 22 5.

247
00:24:27,101 --> 00:24:30,223
So this is more than the windows.

248
00:24:30,243 --> 00:24:31,664
So the bathroom was 2 50.

249
00:24:33,985 --> 00:24:34,806
Yeah.

250
00:24:35,626 --> 00:24:49,655
I was concerned that the bathrooms did not really have a specific scope of which bathrooms they were going to be renovating and like what the actual plan was for renovation.

251
00:24:50,215 --> 00:24:54,298
So in agreement with about the, um,

252
00:24:56,268 --> 00:25:05,370
the bathroom, you know, that it's nice to see them coming to CPA for an actual historic restoration project.

253
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:17,192
I also am relieved to have a more specific scope that has a budget that, you know, that's describing exactly the restoration work that's going to be done.

254
00:25:17,212 --> 00:25:21,653
And that was missing from the bathroom project.

255
00:25:24,376 --> 00:25:27,238
Okay, so we all like this 1 better now.

256
00:25:28,259 --> 00:25:31,921
Uh, can you scroll up a little bit?

257
00:25:32,261 --> 00:25:33,642
Did I see 9 windows?

258
00:25:35,243 --> 00:25:39,606
These are the city council chamber windows, so they are extraordinarily large.

259
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:40,847
I know that they're big.

260
00:25:41,107 --> 00:25:45,830
There are 9 windows for 300 and something thousand dollars.

261
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:46,690
Is that what I'm saying?

262
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:46,950
Yeah.

263
00:25:50,586 --> 00:25:52,527
Well, it's at the top of that.

264
00:25:52,567 --> 00:25:55,469
It said phase one is for windows, phase two is five.

265
00:25:55,529 --> 00:25:59,812
So the whole thing is 322, but they're just going to phase it or phase one.

266
00:26:00,473 --> 00:26:02,414
So they only need phase one money now?

267
00:26:02,474 --> 00:26:03,835
Is that what I'm understanding?

268
00:26:05,256 --> 00:26:09,258
This scope includes phase one and phase two for the total amount 322.5.

269
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:12,080
Right, but why are they phasing?

270
00:26:14,121 --> 00:26:16,123
So that the room isn't completely blacked out.

271
00:26:17,069 --> 00:26:17,730
Oh, yeah.

272
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:18,330
Yeah.

273
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:18,590
Okay.

274
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:18,911
Yeah.

275
00:26:18,931 --> 00:26:22,373
So not like money will be like plywood.

276
00:26:22,994 --> 00:26:23,294
So.

277
00:26:31,721 --> 00:26:32,442
Yes.

278
00:26:37,746 --> 00:26:39,107
Sorry, I just didn't take my hand on.

279
00:26:39,127 --> 00:26:40,528
So we could ask them.

280
00:26:47,027 --> 00:27:00,157
to return to our next meeting and give a presentation and explanation of this project and answer questions.

281
00:27:00,778 --> 00:27:15,029
But I wanted to invite the committee to consider including this in our initial prioritization projects.

282
00:27:17,779 --> 00:27:30,887
including this in our initial prioritization of projects so that we can evaluate which, you know, whether we don't want this project to keep us from making decisions about other projects.

283
00:27:31,407 --> 00:27:41,853
So we may be able to prioritize it high, medium and low, but still request that they come in and give us more information before we make a decision.

284
00:27:45,336 --> 00:27:48,820
That plus this is, this would absolutely blow the bank.

285
00:27:49,081 --> 00:27:56,790
We can't, we would not be able to fund everything, all requests if we gave, if we awarded this entire thing in one year.

286
00:27:58,303 --> 00:28:02,346
We do have some updates to that.

287
00:28:02,366 --> 00:28:02,486
Yes.

288
00:28:02,546 --> 00:28:05,688
All right.

289
00:28:06,369 --> 00:28:07,109
I will listen.

290
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:20,599
In that case, you may have just gotten there because my response was, whoa, this budget kind of, and with no explanation and is almost twat, well, one and a half times more than the previous one and it's phased.

291
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:23,621
Can we divide this out over a few years?

292
00:28:25,582 --> 00:28:27,903
And sounds like you were about to talk about that.

293
00:28:27,983 --> 00:28:32,086
So certainly not opposed to the project at all, but have questions.

294
00:28:33,066 --> 00:28:35,187
That is, so it's possible.

295
00:28:35,407 --> 00:28:51,576
And when we make our, when we do this prioritization exercise, maybe that's something, you know, we may end up, in the past, we have sometimes come up with compromises, breaking projects into chewable bites.

296
00:28:54,151 --> 00:28:58,654
So that might be something that we want to consider if need be.

297
00:28:59,555 --> 00:29:03,959
The other update that we needed to bring to your attention is the St.

298
00:29:03,999 --> 00:29:06,781
Francis Church project has been withdrawn.

299
00:29:07,421 --> 00:29:11,305
So that was the window study and restoration, which was $150,000 project.

300
00:29:11,325 --> 00:29:11,405
Why?

301
00:29:11,425 --> 00:29:13,126
Because the church and the diocese

302
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:34,009
weren't comfortable with sharing the amount of financial information that we were asking for.

303
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:51,163
So we asked them to provide information about the total amount of improvements that they've done on the building within the last five years and what is the capital that they've raised from their own community toward making these improvements.

304
00:29:52,273 --> 00:30:06,562
And, you know, I didn't mean to ask for too much, but it seemed fair before we commit public funding to know how much they have raised in their own community for this project.

305
00:30:07,523 --> 00:30:11,105
And they withdrew rather than providing that information.

306
00:30:15,178 --> 00:30:23,307
Okay, but in your, but in your little Excel, in your Excel sheet of all the projects, maybe I'm jumping and you can tell me to be quiet.

307
00:30:23,927 --> 00:30:25,629
I don't see the city.

308
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:26,750
Is it in here?

309
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:27,371
The window?

310
00:30:27,391 --> 00:30:27,451
The 325?

311
00:30:29,375 --> 00:30:31,156
No, they didn't do that one.

312
00:30:31,316 --> 00:30:33,236
They didn't send it to us either.

313
00:30:33,716 --> 00:30:35,497
Well, because I see St.

314
00:30:35,537 --> 00:30:36,557
Francis crossed off.

315
00:30:37,817 --> 00:30:38,998
But I don't see the addition of 325.

316
00:30:39,538 --> 00:30:39,678
OK.

317
00:30:40,718 --> 00:30:47,040
Well, it would be a replacement of where it says City Hall, Restroom, ADA improvements.

318
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,581
This is a very late change.

319
00:30:48,661 --> 00:30:49,421
It came in today.

320
00:30:49,441 --> 00:30:54,662
So we haven't updated this yet to show the 322 instead of 250.

321
00:30:59,287 --> 00:30:59,667
All right.

322
00:30:59,707 --> 00:31:01,488
So, Teresa, have you done the math?

323
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:04,810
We have done the math.

324
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:14,635
In that spreadsheet, if everybody is looking at the financial worksheet, if you keep scrolling past all the projects, that is a snapshot, and I can share it into here.

325
00:31:14,655 --> 00:31:16,116
I'm going to go ahead and do that.

326
00:31:16,876 --> 00:31:19,217
That is a snapshot of our total financial picture.

327
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:27,910
Let me share this over so Roberta and I can see.

328
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:29,711
Everybody's still seeing the spreadsheet, right?

329
00:31:30,132 --> 00:31:30,452
Yeah.

330
00:31:30,672 --> 00:31:30,952
Yeah.

331
00:31:31,033 --> 00:31:31,293
Okay.

332
00:31:32,914 --> 00:31:35,856
So I can actually see it.

333
00:31:35,876 --> 00:31:36,337
Here we go.

334
00:31:36,857 --> 00:31:46,365
So left to right here, this is what we had budgeted, our 10 and our 15% for the categories with the budgeted reserve.

335
00:31:47,586 --> 00:31:49,828
If we look over, so that's the 1.836 here.

336
00:31:52,088 --> 00:32:01,636
As we look over to the right, that 883 is actually carried over reserves from undesignated funds from previous years.

337
00:32:01,676 --> 00:32:06,719
We had some cancellations of previously funded awards, of which I'm happy to speak of.

338
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:14,466
But just to continue the financial conversation here, we have 883 in the bank, additional to our fiscal 25 budget of 183.

339
00:32:18,462 --> 00:32:23,886
So this 2.7 is actually our total available funds to expend this year.

340
00:32:25,627 --> 00:32:28,469
So if we're still navigating, 2.7 is what we have.

341
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:39,616
This does not reflect the additional 72.5 that would be the difference between the windows and then the back.

342
00:32:39,656 --> 00:32:40,937
I'm sorry, I'm looking at the wrong.

343
00:32:40,997 --> 00:32:41,818
Here we go, right here.

344
00:32:42,098 --> 00:32:43,699
Oops.

345
00:32:43,779 --> 00:32:45,500
I'm able to make that change live.

346
00:32:51,273 --> 00:32:53,714
I'm not sure if you guys will be seeing me make that change.

347
00:32:53,794 --> 00:32:58,374
I'm going to go ahead and try to do that because how we're sharing is a little weird.

348
00:32:58,394 --> 00:32:59,855
Yeah, we can see it.

349
00:33:00,535 --> 00:33:01,455
Fantastic.

350
00:33:01,495 --> 00:33:01,915
Thanks.

351
00:33:02,795 --> 00:33:06,296
Roberta, does this include the match money?

352
00:33:06,316 --> 00:33:09,377
This does not.

353
00:33:09,477 --> 00:33:09,937
No.

354
00:33:10,757 --> 00:33:15,858
So the match money for this year will actually be available to us next year.

355
00:33:17,595 --> 00:33:20,838
Though this includes match money from last year, correct?

356
00:33:20,858 --> 00:33:21,138
Correct.

357
00:33:22,099 --> 00:33:27,423
And I'm designated, you know, we estimate our budgets and then there's a little bit of a difference.

358
00:33:27,463 --> 00:33:28,884
So, this is all just catching up.

359
00:33:29,705 --> 00:33:31,546
I had a question.

360
00:33:35,149 --> 00:33:37,311
Sorry, it takes a 2nd time on my phone.

361
00:33:39,032 --> 00:33:42,455
So, sorry, can I just ask that going back to St Francis for a 2nd?

362
00:33:43,416 --> 00:34:08,691
Yeah so because the project seemed great for us to fund it's kind of a bummer that they withdrew and it just made me wonder is there like a negotiation to be had there like oh you're not comfortable giving us that information like what like can we have a conversation about it or is that just not how this works like i'm just is that has it happened before with the catholic church or what's the deal

363
00:34:09,611 --> 00:34:10,492
I am with you.

364
00:34:10,752 --> 00:34:23,622
I would have been inclined to negotiate, but I think that they had some internal disagreement as a result of this, and I think that has led to the cancellation of the project.

365
00:34:23,642 --> 00:34:24,683
I say, okay.

366
00:34:26,671 --> 00:34:36,077
Yes, yes, not the 1st time the Catholic Church disagreed with an application sent to us our very 1st year.

367
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:42,201
We had an application to restore the Saint was it Saint Claire's or.

368
00:34:44,722 --> 00:34:44,902
St.

369
00:34:44,942 --> 00:34:48,403
Clemens School into affordable housing.

370
00:34:48,423 --> 00:35:05,647
The Somerville Community Corporation, they had the whole plan worked out and the archdiocese wouldn't allow them to use it for affordable housing, so they withdrew.

371
00:35:06,507 --> 00:35:10,328
It almost makes me wonder whether we want some documentation of

372
00:35:11,474 --> 00:35:15,738
the diocese being on board before we like, Oh, a hundred percent.

373
00:35:15,758 --> 00:35:17,639
That's what we asked for in the first one.

374
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:21,062
And they were like, no, okay.

375
00:35:22,524 --> 00:35:23,164
Yeah, man.

376
00:35:23,304 --> 00:35:24,005
So fascinating.

377
00:35:24,145 --> 00:35:24,325
Okay.

378
00:35:24,365 --> 00:35:24,465
Sorry.

379
00:35:24,485 --> 00:35:25,366
I didn't want to derail us.

380
00:35:25,426 --> 00:35:29,550
I just wanted to make sure we couldn't salvage it.

381
00:35:31,551 --> 00:35:32,532
They can always come back.

382
00:35:33,853 --> 00:35:34,074
Yeah.

383
00:35:35,915 --> 00:35:37,156
Um, all right.

384
00:35:37,236 --> 00:35:37,496
So

385
00:35:38,333 --> 00:35:44,515
So our financial picture here is we have more money available than the asks this year.

386
00:35:44,535 --> 00:35:54,799
And so that $150,000 that's crossed out, does that... Yeah, can you just delete the cell that says the $150,000 crossed out?

387
00:35:55,619 --> 00:35:55,879
Yeah.

388
00:35:55,919 --> 00:35:56,600
Yeah, that one.

389
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:57,360
Just delete it.

390
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:58,000
Okay.

391
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:01,241
It didn't count anyway, but I just... Yeah, I had it.

392
00:36:01,321 --> 00:36:01,441
Okay.

393
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:15,472
All right, so the total requests minus the, that leaves about roughly $350,000?

394
00:36:15,512 --> 00:36:15,573
Yes.

395
00:36:15,893 --> 00:36:16,473
Okay.

396
00:36:16,633 --> 00:36:21,854
And last year, after some discussion,

397
00:36:25,617 --> 00:36:32,499
committee members agreed, and of course, we don't have to continue doing the same thing that we agreed on last year.

398
00:36:32,619 --> 00:36:39,661
Last year, after some discussion, the committee members agreed that they wanted to preserve something like $225,000 in our carryover funds just to ensure liquidity.

399
00:36:39,721 --> 00:36:39,881
So,

400
00:36:53,953 --> 00:37:02,538
350,000 is below, I mean, it's more than 225,000, so that leaves an ample amount for liquidity going forward.

401
00:37:04,579 --> 00:37:22,191
So we don't have to fund all of the projects that have requested, but it looks as though, once again, the requests approximately equal the funding available, so we could fund the projects as requested.

402
00:37:23,797 --> 00:37:26,679
Doug, is it time for the Andre LaRue stamp?

403
00:37:31,023 --> 00:37:31,703
Can you hear me, Joan?

404
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:33,465
I can hear you now.

405
00:37:37,087 --> 00:37:42,692
Yeah, I don't think we need to prioritize these products as much as we probably have in the past couple of years.

406
00:37:43,472 --> 00:37:49,397
When we were short, if we can find everything, if we think they're valuable and worthwhile, then yeah, we should

407
00:37:50,012 --> 00:37:54,776
but focus on just the value of the projects that we want to fund and not the priority.

408
00:37:57,238 --> 00:38:00,802
Okay.

409
00:38:00,822 --> 00:38:13,473
So where we have this prioritization column, we should, I think it's still helpful for us to go through project by project and

410
00:38:14,028 --> 00:38:16,229
have some discussion about how we value them.

411
00:38:16,689 --> 00:38:24,792
But maybe we can score them 1, 2, or 3, wrapping our heads around what we mean by 1, 2, or 3.

412
00:38:24,832 --> 00:38:32,334
1 means they're highly valued, and we fully support them going forward.

413
00:38:32,354 --> 00:38:36,676
3, meaning perhaps we don't support it going forward.

414
00:38:36,696 --> 00:38:38,657
2, meaning

415
00:38:42,732 --> 00:38:52,478
you know, we maybe have some disagreement about it or some less than enthusiastic support for it.

416
00:38:54,459 --> 00:39:04,645
So maybe we can go through each of these and see how we fall on each of the projects so that we decide how we want to.

417
00:39:04,665 --> 00:39:08,248
And maybe we can also, as we go through each of them,

418
00:39:09,243 --> 00:39:17,289
people can raise whether they think that we need to consider any conditions on these that we haven't had in the past.

419
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:24,075
Well, I think we also need to hear from the city of Medford about the council chamber window restoration.

420
00:39:24,095 --> 00:39:26,036
They have not made a presentation to us.

421
00:39:27,057 --> 00:39:34,183
Yeah, so we'll make a request for that to come to us next month to talk about that project.

422
00:39:38,565 --> 00:39:39,606
Doug has his hand up.

423
00:39:39,846 --> 00:39:41,607
Is that from last time or is that a new one?

424
00:39:41,627 --> 00:39:42,547
No, he just popped it up.

425
00:39:43,108 --> 00:39:43,448
Okay.

426
00:39:44,008 --> 00:39:44,708
No, that's new.

427
00:39:45,509 --> 00:39:54,894
Just two quick comments about the City of Medford projects, which I both think are excellent, but they both, to Joan's earlier point, they need documentation, right?

428
00:39:54,914 --> 00:40:03,279
The windows, all it is is a verbal description, and I just want to make sure that that is consistent with the restoration of windows.

429
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:07,523
that we've done at Chevalier and other places that have done that.

430
00:40:08,203 --> 00:40:16,430
We've had a pretty high standard for that work, and it's usually a little bit more than just a shopping list of pieces.

431
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:24,716
There's usually something involved with it, drawing-wise, or at least in alignment with the Secretary of Interior's standards, that kind of thing, Joan.

432
00:40:25,377 --> 00:40:26,798
And Roberta?

433
00:40:27,498 --> 00:40:27,859
Yeah.

434
00:40:28,839 --> 00:40:31,722
So Paul really went, I'm sorry, go ahead.

435
00:40:33,621 --> 00:40:33,741
No, no.

436
00:40:33,761 --> 00:40:37,685
Why don't you address the windows, and then I'll talk about the ADA bathrooms from there.

437
00:40:37,705 --> 00:40:57,065
I know that's not part of it, but it's... So, Paul Rickey, when he emailed about this change earlier today, said that the company that gave them the estimate for the windows is a historic preservation company, and he gave some examples of

438
00:40:57,902 --> 00:41:01,404
historic preservation projects that they've done on major buildings in the area.

439
00:41:01,945 --> 00:41:21,498
But I think it's fair that we ask them, in addition to the budget that they've given us, if he could just name the company that they're working with and give us some balls so that we know that it is a company that's qualified to do historic restoration of windows.

440
00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:24,130
Agreed.

441
00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:30,694
And if they're put together that quote, they must have taken photos just to show kind of the before versus the after photos.

442
00:41:30,714 --> 00:41:35,456
We just need a little bit more documentation, nothing that would prevent us from awarding anything.

443
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:41,720
Like the Royal House, that is like the best application that they sent us, you know?

444
00:41:44,101 --> 00:41:45,062
Yeah.

445
00:41:45,082 --> 00:41:47,023
Yeah.

446
00:41:47,203 --> 00:41:53,046
So we'll ask them to provide some more documentation and also give them feedback that the committee is

447
00:41:54,297 --> 00:42:01,102
Um, favorable to this changed request and would like to, um.

448
00:42:02,944 --> 00:42:15,553
Would like to consider making a recommendation for funding, but that we need more documentation before so that we can demonstrate the value of this project to city council.

449
00:42:18,956 --> 00:42:19,396
Exactly.

450
00:42:22,459 --> 00:42:25,421
Is someone coming on to talk about the shade thing today?

451
00:42:27,842 --> 00:42:29,463
The Riverside Plaza?

452
00:42:29,703 --> 00:42:29,824
Yes.

453
00:42:29,924 --> 00:42:31,825
Is that on the agenda?

454
00:42:31,865 --> 00:42:32,845
Is somebody coming to talk?

455
00:42:33,446 --> 00:42:34,186
I think I saw Amanda here.

456
00:42:34,206 --> 00:42:36,007
I haven't gotten there as an agenda item yet.

457
00:42:36,588 --> 00:42:37,168
Ah, okay.

458
00:42:37,428 --> 00:42:41,010
But Amanda is here, and the mayor wanted me to text.

459
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:45,913
The mayor wants to come on and speak in support as well, because the metal technically came from her office.

460
00:42:47,254 --> 00:42:48,114
Would we like to...

461
00:42:49,487 --> 00:42:55,155
hear that request first, or would we like to go through the prioritization first?

462
00:42:57,418 --> 00:43:01,744
Well, are we like putting that in the category of like, yeah, because, yeah, I agree.

463
00:43:02,265 --> 00:43:06,531
I mean, even if it's an immediate off, whatever approval.

464
00:43:09,857 --> 00:43:11,418
Yeah, it's just a matter of the order.

465
00:43:11,458 --> 00:43:16,679
I think there's no point in keeping Amanda waiting longer, but the mayor did want to come on.

466
00:43:16,759 --> 00:43:22,521
So we should maybe- Yeah, you want to text her and then we can just kind of go through our priority and when she pops on, we'll go do that.

467
00:43:23,642 --> 00:43:23,922
Yeah.

468
00:43:25,402 --> 00:43:26,023
That makes sense.

469
00:43:28,043 --> 00:43:31,064
I just texted her.

470
00:43:32,365 --> 00:43:35,946
I believe Amanda's eavesdropping right now.

471
00:43:35,966 --> 00:43:38,687
I told her I would text her as well.

472
00:43:40,675 --> 00:43:40,855
Yeah.

473
00:43:41,735 --> 00:43:54,219
So I don't remember anything about the Shiloh application of it being an emergency or need to be approved super quick other than they just want to get going.

474
00:43:55,219 --> 00:43:55,619
Right.

475
00:43:56,119 --> 00:44:02,401
So I'm a little nervous to set a precedent there for no other reason that they just want to get going.

476
00:44:02,481 --> 00:44:05,022
And I feel like their application actually really wasn't that strong.

477
00:44:05,042 --> 00:44:07,663
I didn't feel very confident in the numbers they gave.

478
00:44:08,443 --> 00:44:12,171
I think she, you know, if you have an emotional case for the project, which is great, but I don't.

479
00:44:13,093 --> 00:44:16,981
My 2 cents, I don't think it's necessary to give them approval.

480
00:44:17,001 --> 00:44:18,323
I have anybody else.

481
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:31,683
I wanted to present that as an option, given that they had originally asked for an off-cycle decision.

482
00:44:32,303 --> 00:44:41,047
But if we want to hold to giving them a decision along with everyone else next month, I'm fine with that too.

483
00:44:42,928 --> 00:44:46,349
Yeah, didn't they say the reason they came off-cycle was because

484
00:44:47,343 --> 00:44:56,986
There wasn't anything in particular that was driving their request except that the longer they wait, the longer it'll take, which is true for every project.

485
00:44:57,006 --> 00:45:07,890
So it's not like something was imminently going to fail or something like that, or there wasn't any driver except the calendar that they wanted to keep going.

486
00:45:08,870 --> 00:45:11,291
Yeah.

487
00:45:11,331 --> 00:45:11,951
That is true.

488
00:45:14,515 --> 00:45:17,396
Mayor acknowledged, but I think she's trying to join right now.

489
00:45:17,456 --> 00:45:19,957
And Amanda is waiting on bated breath.

490
00:45:20,457 --> 00:45:22,698
Does she have the right link?

491
00:45:23,838 --> 00:45:24,719
Oh, yeah.

492
00:45:25,399 --> 00:45:26,679
Actually, here comes the mayor.

493
00:45:26,779 --> 00:45:26,919
OK.

494
00:45:26,959 --> 00:45:38,504
Hi, Amanda.

495
00:45:38,544 --> 00:45:41,985
Hey, everyone.

496
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:51,548
And, uh, Mayor, I can see it looks like you joined us.

497
00:45:53,129 --> 00:45:53,610
There you are.

498
00:45:53,630 --> 00:45:54,971
Yeah.

499
00:45:55,672 --> 00:45:56,132
Hey, everybody.

500
00:45:56,152 --> 00:45:56,572
Good evening.

501
00:45:57,333 --> 00:45:57,894
Good evening.

502
00:46:00,135 --> 00:46:01,717
So thank you for joining us.

503
00:46:01,817 --> 00:46:11,025
I understand that you would like to present your request for an expedited decision for the Riverside Plaza.

504
00:46:14,109 --> 00:46:14,634
Yes, thank you.

505
00:46:16,478 --> 00:46:24,062
Thank you to Teresa for putting this on and Amanda who's been working on all the park projects with us over the last several years.

506
00:46:24,963 --> 00:46:33,128
The Riverside Plaza projects, one that we've been looking into for several years, prices came back pretty high.

507
00:46:33,268 --> 00:46:37,990
So what Amanda did for us was apply for a park grant.

508
00:46:38,711 --> 00:46:42,533
And we were very excited to receive that grant recently.

509
00:46:43,394 --> 00:46:44,654
That grant does need a match.

510
00:46:46,583 --> 00:46:50,046
which is going to hopefully be approved tonight.

511
00:46:50,086 --> 00:46:54,449
I know that you do consider that potentially somewhat of an emergency.

512
00:46:54,749 --> 00:46:59,253
Thank you, Chair Cameron, for speaking with me last week on this issue.

513
00:46:59,273 --> 00:47:04,797
We have to go before the city council as soon as possible.

514
00:47:05,357 --> 00:47:12,322
I think my chief of staff is prepping that with Teresa's support for next Tuesday's council meeting.

515
00:47:12,342 --> 00:47:16,324
And with the match, we'll be able to move forward on that project.

516
00:47:16,565 --> 00:47:33,296
That is, Riverside Plaza is a beautiful spot to host events, and it's used daily, especially in the nice weather, for people to congregate, either play chess or have lunch, have dinner in that location, and the one

517
00:47:34,517 --> 00:47:45,005
sticking point that is tough for our residents and business owners and employees that frequent that area is it's, it is right directly in the sun.

518
00:47:45,265 --> 00:47:53,612
And with global warming, it makes it very difficult to have an enjoyable lunch, especially in the summer months when it's 80-90 degrees.

519
00:47:53,812 --> 00:48:03,380
So shade in that location is so necessary and something that will be greatly appreciated by all who use that, including City Hall employees.

520
00:48:06,398 --> 00:48:06,898
Thank you.

521
00:48:07,878 --> 00:48:14,760
And thank you, Amanda, for the effort to obtain the park grant.

522
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:18,240
Oh, my pleasure.

523
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:19,601
Is it a dollar for dollar match?

524
00:48:20,661 --> 00:48:21,441
It's slightly.

525
00:48:22,401 --> 00:48:24,142
I can't remember the exact percentage.

526
00:48:24,602 --> 00:48:26,642
The park grant is actually slightly more.

527
00:48:27,182 --> 00:48:29,363
It's a calculation that's done at the state level.

528
00:48:30,543 --> 00:48:33,083
So it varies from municipality to municipality.

529
00:48:33,183 --> 00:48:34,784
And I want to say ours is something like 50

530
00:48:37,230 --> 00:48:40,713
It's like 52% park grant and then 48% match.

531
00:48:40,773 --> 00:48:41,774
Great.

532
00:48:45,777 --> 00:48:47,138
It's always great to see matching funds.

533
00:48:50,341 --> 00:48:52,943
Just gets you that much more for your dollar.

534
00:48:52,963 --> 00:48:54,264
Exactly.

535
00:48:55,991 --> 00:48:56,232
Right.

536
00:48:56,332 --> 00:49:02,598
And will that allow us to, we had talked about a potential third sale over the performance space.

537
00:49:03,238 --> 00:49:11,846
I know you said you were going to look at that because having been to the Oktoberfest this past year, they were directly in the sun and sweating while they were playing.

538
00:49:11,927 --> 00:49:14,729
So that would be good if you could look at that too.

539
00:49:15,290 --> 00:49:16,070
Yeah, we could.

540
00:49:18,603 --> 00:49:23,266
We haven't made any design changes beyond the conceptual that was presented to you all.

541
00:49:23,886 --> 00:49:36,273
But within the budget that we have, I would talk to the designer about what adjustments could be made and maybe there's a way to prioritize over the stage.

542
00:49:37,173 --> 00:49:45,658
And I'd be happy to, we could shake it out where after final designs are set, we could present to you all

543
00:49:46,228 --> 00:49:56,971
Um, before we go up to bid, if you're curious to see where the design is at and, or obviously we can, you know, it's your prerogative to, um, attach conditions to the approval as well.

544
00:49:59,091 --> 00:50:06,333
But I guess to, in short, to answer your question, Joan, we haven't like adjusted anything from the concept because we don't have design funds at the moment.

545
00:50:07,093 --> 00:50:14,115
Um, but this would, this match and part of the park grant would go towards design and, um, we can,

546
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:22,804
you know, within the constraints of the budget that we proposed for this project, adjust accordingly.

547
00:50:22,824 --> 00:50:24,225
Excellent.

548
00:50:24,245 --> 00:50:25,666
Thanks, Amanda.

549
00:50:26,787 --> 00:50:32,890
And we also want to make sure that we have some rat prevention built into the design as well.

550
00:50:33,050 --> 00:50:39,894
So let me know if I can help to bring some more information from that for my colleagues.

551
00:50:41,263 --> 00:50:46,685
Yes, I would be really, um, I think you had mentioned having a conversation with a contact at Somerville.

552
00:50:47,006 --> 00:50:52,888
Um, I'd love to set something up there to learn from their experience and we can bring that to our design team.

553
00:50:54,709 --> 00:50:55,029
Thanks.

554
00:50:59,051 --> 00:51:02,853
Any other questions or comments for Amanda and the mayor?

555
00:51:02,873 --> 00:51:10,236
No, I think this meets the conditions that we had set forth in our ordinance about, um, you know,

556
00:51:10,730 --> 00:51:17,731
the sort of off cycle or emergency consideration of a project based on an outside influence, so.

557
00:51:20,592 --> 00:51:20,732
Yep.

558
00:51:20,852 --> 00:51:22,332
And just for me, thank you so much.

559
00:51:22,452 --> 00:51:24,713
Thank you all for serving on this committee and all your hard work.

560
00:51:24,793 --> 00:51:29,694
And thank you for considering this project that we've been working on for so long.

561
00:51:30,314 --> 00:51:31,474
Thank you, Amanda and Teresa again.

562
00:51:31,494 --> 00:51:35,755
Thank you.

563
00:51:38,973 --> 00:51:44,516
So Roberta, are you suggesting that we vote on this now before we continue with the rest of them?

564
00:51:46,397 --> 00:51:49,518
So I think that we'll make a decision.

565
00:51:49,538 --> 00:52:01,785
So I think we still need to go through this valuation prioritization exercise, but safe to say that we will be able to vote on this this evening.

566
00:52:02,795 --> 00:52:14,358
And before you all came on, Amanda and Mayor, we found that we have the funding available to fund all of the projects requested this funding round.

567
00:52:14,658 --> 00:52:23,501
So we're just going through each project to evaluate how we feel about each of the projects.

568
00:52:24,161 --> 00:52:28,542
So we'll go through that first, I think, but we'll make sure that wherever we

569
00:52:29,219 --> 00:52:37,545
leave on whatever point we get to, we'll make a decision about this project before we really close this evening.

570
00:52:38,886 --> 00:52:45,351
And Mayor and Amanda, if you feel free to go back to your evenings, I'd be happy to text you with the outcome of that.

571
00:52:47,012 --> 00:52:47,432
Thank you.

572
00:52:47,452 --> 00:52:48,613
Thank you very much.

573
00:52:48,653 --> 00:52:49,253
Thank you.

574
00:52:50,855 --> 00:52:51,115
Thanks, guys.

575
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:04,422
I'm going to re-share the financial worksheet again.

576
00:53:04,442 --> 00:53:08,666
Thank you all for speaking with my colleagues.

577
00:53:09,527 --> 00:53:09,867
All right.

578
00:53:10,748 --> 00:53:21,978
So the Riverside Plaza shade structure that we've just been talking about, prioritization, where do we land with this project?

579
00:53:28,484 --> 00:53:31,208
I really like it, not just because it's my closest park.

580
00:53:31,889 --> 00:53:35,413
I think it moves a space that's good to grade.

581
00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:41,962
I how about if.

582
00:53:43,284 --> 00:53:45,167
Well, we can't see I wonder if you can.

583
00:53:45,770 --> 00:53:48,872
show everybody on the screen, Teresa.

584
00:53:49,032 --> 00:53:49,912
That is everybody.

585
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:50,753
OK.

586
00:53:51,133 --> 00:53:52,954
And we don't have all of your faces.

587
00:53:53,034 --> 00:53:54,135
So there isn't a real.

588
00:53:55,456 --> 00:53:58,357
I wanted to like everybody to hold up one, two or three fingers.

589
00:53:59,438 --> 00:54:04,841
That would be a really quick way to see like where we all end with this project.

590
00:54:05,982 --> 00:54:06,882
I'm seeing ones.

591
00:54:06,942 --> 00:54:09,164
Is there anybody who is not a one for this project?

592
00:54:11,905 --> 00:54:14,747
OK, I think this is a number one priority.

593
00:54:16,386 --> 00:54:18,546
Next year, I'll make tattles or something like that.

594
00:54:21,567 --> 00:54:22,127
All right.

595
00:54:22,227 --> 00:54:26,508
So car park renovation, the final tranche.

596
00:54:27,988 --> 00:54:28,228
Yes.

597
00:54:29,689 --> 00:54:30,429
Also ones.

598
00:54:30,729 --> 00:54:31,469
I see ones.

599
00:54:31,549 --> 00:54:32,909
Anybody not a one for this?

600
00:54:32,929 --> 00:54:32,969
OK.

601
00:54:33,629 --> 00:54:42,251
I think that's the best thing, is if you can shout out if you are not a one for each project.

602
00:54:42,631 --> 00:54:43,151
That's good.

603
00:54:43,371 --> 00:54:45,592
That way, it speaks off the video.

604
00:54:45,612 --> 00:54:45,772
Yeah.

605
00:54:47,138 --> 00:54:51,824
So the condom shell lighting improvements.

606
00:54:51,844 --> 00:55:00,455
I have also one for this project, I'm trying to recall.

607
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:03,971
This project had, I think, two parts to it.

608
00:55:04,071 --> 00:55:09,273
One of them was lighting the stage and the other was lighting the pedestrian.

609
00:55:09,293 --> 00:55:10,413
The surrounding area.

610
00:55:10,653 --> 00:55:10,873
Right.

611
00:55:10,994 --> 00:55:13,154
It gets really dark around the surrounding area.

612
00:55:13,534 --> 00:55:13,694
Right.

613
00:55:13,754 --> 00:55:16,515
And just to clarify, it is just from the parking lot.

614
00:55:16,596 --> 00:55:18,776
Basically, we're at the path of the farmer's market.

615
00:55:19,156 --> 00:55:20,497
That would be illuminated.

616
00:55:20,617 --> 00:55:22,878
Yeah, they are the farmer's market.

617
00:55:23,837 --> 00:55:33,223
is working on a letter of support for this application for whatever it's worth, verbal conversations, they very much support this project because it would help prolong their season as well.

618
00:55:34,704 --> 00:55:38,967
Sometimes during the late fall, they close up shop at six because it's so dark.

619
00:55:40,048 --> 00:55:40,949
Just wanted to add that.

620
00:55:42,049 --> 00:55:46,372
So we didn't have any concerns about the scope, but we did.

621
00:55:47,193 --> 00:55:53,137
I wanted to try to address something about the noise in our recommendation.

622
00:55:54,424 --> 00:55:59,267
Um, and I'm not sure, like, maybe, maybe we skip it.

623
00:55:59,388 --> 00:56:01,949
We gave them the feedback already verbally in our meeting.

624
00:56:01,969 --> 00:56:05,071
Maybe that was sufficient or I don't know if we want to.

625
00:56:07,456 --> 00:56:31,712
talk about the hours of use for the park and just as a reminder kevin did had shared kevin bailey who's the recreation director that right now programming amplified programming does not extend past 9 p.m okay he has no intention of changing that it would just make this a more pleasurable experience for the performers on the stage as well as for guests yeah so i just wanted to clarify that so

626
00:56:33,248 --> 00:56:45,994
I just wanna, I'm thinking about like, so that we're not really overstepping our bounds, but that we show that the city council, we show that we've given some thought to these matters.

627
00:56:46,194 --> 00:57:01,362
I wonder if it's worth mentioning that the CPC supports the recreation departments careful

628
00:57:02,655 --> 00:57:06,017
consideration of the hours of amplified entertainment.

629
00:57:06,637 --> 00:57:22,585
So it's their prerogative to decide what those hours should be, but we just want to acknowledge that that's a sensitive subject that they should be careful with.

630
00:57:23,125 --> 00:57:24,606
Yeah, and that might be in the

631
00:57:25,342 --> 00:57:33,409
not as a condition, but somewhere in the agreement, in the description of the project.

632
00:57:37,052 --> 00:57:38,534
So that's a one as well.

633
00:57:41,516 --> 00:57:48,943
All right, Placestate Park Tennis Court Reconstruction.

634
00:57:50,864 --> 00:57:52,630
I wouldn't say that's a number one.

635
00:57:52,891 --> 00:57:54,998
That tennis court didn't look that bad.

636
00:57:56,864 --> 00:57:57,684
I feel that too.

637
00:57:57,724 --> 00:57:58,404
Yeah, I agree.

638
00:57:58,444 --> 00:58:07,747
And I feel like the commentary was like, well, it's like next on the to-do list kind of thing, if I remember and correct me if I'm wrong, but I give that a two.

639
00:58:08,487 --> 00:58:09,507
I'm giving it a one.

640
00:58:12,248 --> 00:58:21,450
I mean, I feel like the price tag really sucks and that was really dispiriting, but it is our most used tennis court.

641
00:58:21,830 --> 00:58:26,431
It's where we do like all of our significant programming with other cities, et cetera.

642
00:58:27,692 --> 00:58:29,614
And the pictures were bad.

643
00:58:30,375 --> 00:58:34,199
So I'm, yeah, I feel like we're the right place to fund it.

644
00:58:34,259 --> 00:58:34,899
We should fund it.

645
00:58:34,919 --> 00:58:37,542
Yeah, I think we should definitely fund it.

646
00:58:38,183 --> 00:58:40,946
But I think it's just priorities, not as high as the others.

647
00:58:41,026 --> 00:58:41,747
Yeah, for sure.

648
00:58:42,410 --> 00:58:49,092
Yeah, I think if we were didn't have enough funding, it's one that I would definitely want to talk about.

649
00:58:49,232 --> 00:58:56,535
But we have the funding and the case is certainly strong enough that if we have the money, it should get it there.

650
00:59:00,952 --> 00:59:04,955
I think the consensus seems to be a two and twos are getting funding.

651
00:59:05,015 --> 00:59:07,977
It's not a situation of only ones are getting funded.

652
00:59:09,198 --> 00:59:10,258
I just wanted to register.

653
00:59:10,318 --> 00:59:13,661
I felt like my biggest issue with it was the price tag, not the actual project.

654
00:59:14,001 --> 00:59:14,681
Got it.

655
00:59:20,105 --> 00:59:20,545
All right.

656
00:59:21,166 --> 00:59:25,149
So that was for the open space projects on to historic preservation.

657
00:59:25,729 --> 00:59:29,852
The exterior siding restoration for Unitarian Universalist Church.

658
00:59:30,945 --> 00:59:32,046
Oh, okay.

659
00:59:32,706 --> 00:59:32,946
Yeah.

660
00:59:36,288 --> 00:59:37,869
That was a pretty sad shape.

661
00:59:39,010 --> 00:59:39,430
Yeah.

662
00:59:40,291 --> 00:59:41,852
Is there anybody not a one for this?

663
00:59:44,073 --> 00:59:44,754
Doug says one.

664
00:59:49,717 --> 00:59:51,518
I assume.

665
00:59:52,138 --> 00:59:52,939
So, here we are.

666
01:00:00,645 --> 01:00:22,857
love whatever everybody just watch me flounder in front of it it stays what you want it to um all right now the city hall council chambers window restoration assuming that they give us the information that we need next month how would we feel about this project

667
01:00:25,729 --> 01:00:30,551
Does the information they're going to give us also include sell out the application, like, all the other applicants.

668
01:00:31,031 --> 01:00:31,592
Okay.

669
01:00:31,672 --> 01:00:32,772
Yeah.

670
01:00:32,792 --> 01:00:37,594
I'll give it a 1 with an asterisk.

671
01:00:37,654 --> 01:00:37,975
I guess.

672
01:00:38,615 --> 01:00:49,880
Yeah, well, assuming that their application shows us pictures of how these things are completely failing and in order to maintain the envelope of the building, they need to be restored.

673
01:00:49,940 --> 01:00:52,041
So 1 with an asterisk.

674
01:00:53,903 --> 01:00:54,764
I'm just curious.

675
01:00:54,804 --> 01:01:01,708
Do you know why this didn't make it above the bathrooms in their applications this year?

676
01:01:02,789 --> 01:01:06,311
I think it was being requested by two different parties.

677
01:01:06,931 --> 01:01:16,557
So it's not that the facilities director said, what is the area that needs the biggest improvement this year, and then proactively came to us with a request.

678
01:01:17,117 --> 01:01:18,538
I think that the

679
01:01:22,762 --> 01:01:28,144
The ADA, Department of Francis, came to him with a request, the urgent request for bathrooms.

680
01:01:29,004 --> 01:01:38,307
And simultaneously, the City Council came with an urgent request for the windows because they're not functioning.

681
01:01:39,267 --> 01:01:46,950
And for some reason, CPA got attached to the bathroom idea.

682
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:54,045
but CPA didn't get attached to the chamber windows idea initially.

683
01:01:55,206 --> 01:02:09,977
But this is, you know, one of the things that I had wanted them to do was look at the big picture of everything that you're doing this year and all the different funding sources that you're planning to spend this year and which ones are appropriate to go toward this project.

684
01:02:10,277 --> 01:02:17,062
And so I think that that's exactly what we're landing on now by making this change.

685
01:02:18,580 --> 01:02:20,901
Reg, thank you, welcome, good evening.

686
01:02:21,401 --> 01:02:38,929
The big thing that we're talking about right now, if you wouldn't have received this update, is that the City Hall bathrooms application is being swapped for a City Hall Council Chamber windows request.

687
01:02:39,789 --> 01:02:43,550
And- If you didn't hear the yelling just now down the hall.

688
01:02:43,831 --> 01:02:45,411
Someone's trying to throw something out the window.

689
01:02:45,431 --> 01:02:46,492
They might need some new windows.

690
01:02:46,532 --> 01:02:46,892
Yeah.

691
01:02:49,832 --> 01:03:01,405
And where this came from is the I was just explaining different stakeholders in City Hall made urgent requests of the facilities director.

692
01:03:02,099 --> 01:03:04,780
to make these immediate improvements.

693
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:12,402
And he asked for CPA funding for the bathrooms and asked for stabilization funding for the City Hall and Council Chamber windows.

694
01:03:13,423 --> 01:03:22,225
And with some discussion with Teresa, the Mayor, the Facilities Director, and City Councilors, we

695
01:03:24,476 --> 01:03:44,407
talked about which was the most appropriate way to fund this project and they've now requested swapping the two so that CBA would restore the windows and ensure that it's done according to historic preservation standards and stabilization funds will be used for the bathrooms.

696
01:03:45,208 --> 01:03:50,891
So that's exactly where we're at right now with the funding.

697
01:03:53,979 --> 01:03:54,459
It's a bit more.

698
01:03:54,479 --> 01:03:54,739
It's $73,000 more.

699
01:03:54,759 --> 01:03:56,721
So the bathrooms, they were asking for $250,000, and the windows is for $322,000.

700
01:03:56,761 --> 01:04:00,222
But the windows project is a defined scope, whereas the bathrooms was just throwing a dart at the wall.

701
01:04:00,242 --> 01:04:02,303
There was no scope attached to the $250,000 request.

702
01:04:24,024 --> 01:04:24,344
Yes.

703
01:04:24,504 --> 01:04:27,945
So, um, where does that put us in our totality?

704
01:04:28,425 --> 01:04:37,647
I mean, before I listen, I think my glasses the way on here.

705
01:04:37,847 --> 01:04:46,589
So, so if we had the extra money and we still are, we still able to, um, cause we were, we were below budget, right?

706
01:04:47,229 --> 01:04:49,029
Yeah, we are a little below budget still.

707
01:04:49,309 --> 01:04:51,170
Uh, still these two numbers are here.

708
01:04:51,190 --> 01:04:51,250
Yes.

709
01:04:53,238 --> 01:04:57,501
The 2.7 on the bottom, that is our available funding that we have.

710
01:04:57,521 --> 01:04:58,482
Versus 2.3.

711
01:04:58,642 --> 01:04:59,743
And the 2.3 are the asks.

712
01:04:59,763 --> 01:05:00,504
Thank you.

713
01:05:01,164 --> 01:05:02,825
Yeah, but you didn't tell them that St.

714
01:05:02,866 --> 01:05:04,707
Francis withdrew their application.

715
01:05:04,727 --> 01:05:05,748
I did.

716
01:05:05,788 --> 01:05:06,008
St.

717
01:05:06,048 --> 01:05:07,629
Francis withdrew their application.

718
01:05:07,649 --> 01:05:11,933
So we did pick up, they were originally asking for $150,000.

719
01:05:12,113 --> 01:05:13,074
Are they Christians?

720
01:05:14,135 --> 01:05:14,255
No.

721
01:05:18,958 --> 01:05:23,060
They balked at providing the financial information that we asked them for.

722
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:27,521
There are some challenges with that, so they chose to withdraw.

723
01:05:31,143 --> 01:05:34,184
So we still have a little bit of wiggle room at the end.

724
01:05:34,264 --> 01:05:40,406
Yes, but we gained $150,000 back to our budget for this year, not having that as a consideration.

725
01:05:40,426 --> 01:05:43,587
But then we kicked back $75,000 for the windows.

726
01:05:44,087 --> 01:05:44,308
Right.

727
01:05:44,728 --> 01:05:46,969
Yes, actually, to your point,

728
01:05:50,025 --> 01:05:58,031
I alluded that there were some canceled awards that kind of came in through this funding that's down here, just to explain what they are.

729
01:05:58,051 --> 01:06:07,839
$76,000 here is actually for the Red Pond Aeration project that this body funded a couple years ago.

730
01:06:07,859 --> 01:06:14,025
They're having a difficult time sourcing an adequate consultant, as well as that was

731
01:06:14,784 --> 01:06:19,588
as a reaction to having high E. coli levels in the pond a few years ago.

732
01:06:19,928 --> 01:06:21,970
It hasn't been an issue the past couple of years.

733
01:06:22,190 --> 01:06:31,637
So seeing as they're having challenges finding the right partner on the project, and it hasn't necessarily been a need, the Recreation Department released us funding back to us.

734
01:06:34,379 --> 01:06:38,322
And then the $129,000 here for historic preservation that came back.

735
01:06:38,422 --> 01:06:39,163
And again, this

736
01:06:40,232 --> 01:06:41,232
I divided it.

737
01:06:41,332 --> 01:06:43,333
It's just going to come back into our budgeted reserve.

738
01:06:43,353 --> 01:06:46,455
So that $129,000 doesn't have to go to historic preservation.

739
01:06:46,495 --> 01:06:49,276
It's just sourcing, identifying the source.

740
01:06:49,776 --> 01:07:09,584
That was for the canceled awards at Engine 3 for the fire station window study, as we determined that they don't have historic windows in which to study any longer, as well as this body funded Chevalier ADA improvements a few years ago.

741
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:11,141
At least those were done.

742
01:07:11,241 --> 01:07:14,702
However, they opted to use other funding besides CPA.

743
01:07:14,722 --> 01:07:16,203
So that money has been returned to us.

744
01:07:16,543 --> 01:07:17,684
So the project was completed.

745
01:07:17,704 --> 01:07:19,545
They just didn't use CPA funds for it.

746
01:07:19,585 --> 01:07:24,687
So that money has come back to us just to identify where that money came from.

747
01:07:25,027 --> 01:07:25,868
Thanks.

748
01:07:26,188 --> 01:07:29,609
Thank you for the update.

749
01:07:30,070 --> 01:07:30,910
And the 678,000.

750
01:07:31,450 --> 01:07:34,652
So last year we opted to keep somewhere in the order of 225,000.

751
01:07:34,712 --> 01:07:34,912
And so

752
01:07:37,628 --> 01:07:47,055
The balance is perhaps due to additional carried over funds that we had or maybe a higher than anticipated state match?

753
01:07:47,656 --> 01:07:59,605
Higher than anticipated state match, a little bit of just, we estimate based off of, we estimate our revenue based off of surcharge of previous years with kind of trying to factor in some growth there.

754
01:07:59,685 --> 01:08:02,267
So it's just an estimated number.

755
01:08:02,287 --> 01:08:06,410
So this is now the actualized figures for that.

756
01:08:07,182 --> 01:08:12,746
to get us to where we're at with 2.7 available.

757
01:08:12,766 --> 01:08:17,229
2.7 available, 3, 2.4 requested.

758
01:08:18,070 --> 01:08:36,002
So we have the funds to award everything that's been requested of us this time, but we're going through right now this prioritization or really determining what value each of these projects is to us.

759
01:08:36,703 --> 01:08:42,426
so that we can decide which ones we are likely to award funds to.

760
01:08:43,426 --> 01:08:59,074
Raising any questions or concerns that we have about each project, and then, Teresa, and any conditions that we want to suggest for Teresa to include in the recommendation letters that we'll vote on next month.

761
01:09:00,415 --> 01:09:03,777
So that catches Reggie up.

762
01:09:04,658 --> 01:09:17,107
You can see that we've already just quickly gone through Riverside Plaza, shade structure, improvements, car park, renovation, convention, lighting improvements and placed in park tennis courts.

763
01:09:17,788 --> 01:09:20,149
And everyone has given.

764
01:09:23,031 --> 01:09:48,172
So one is the highest priority, and all of the projects that we've talked about so far have the highest priority, except maybe the question of Playstead Park Tennis Courts, just because the price tag is so... ...at Playstead.

765
01:09:49,634 --> 01:09:50,715
You just froze for a second.

766
01:09:52,751 --> 01:09:53,331
Are you still there?

767
01:09:53,351 --> 01:09:53,952
Are we still here?

768
01:09:53,992 --> 01:09:54,152
Yep.

769
01:09:54,752 --> 01:09:55,272
I'm still here.

770
01:09:55,812 --> 01:09:59,493
I'm still playing around with Zoom to try and see everyone.

771
01:09:59,513 --> 01:10:01,914
My internet connection is unstable.

772
01:10:01,954 --> 01:10:02,314
How great.

773
01:10:03,034 --> 01:10:03,335
All right.

774
01:10:03,555 --> 01:10:17,139
So we just talked about the City Hall Council Chambers window, and we'll work on having the information from them that we need to review that project next month.

775
01:10:19,698 --> 01:10:29,806
So the facilities department also has an application for building envelope restoration at the Heckner Center.

776
01:10:33,069 --> 01:10:37,112
So I think I can still see everyone.

777
01:10:37,752 --> 01:10:46,880
Show me if you want ones or shout if you think this is less valuable than a one, if you think it's something else.

778
01:10:50,701 --> 01:10:51,601
I think this is a one.

779
01:10:55,563 --> 01:10:59,284
The Oak Grove Cemetery building restoration.

780
01:10:59,304 --> 01:11:02,706
Phase two.

781
01:11:06,807 --> 01:11:12,089
This would, again, this is a reminder, get this project to be shelf-ready.

782
01:11:13,350 --> 01:11:15,811
It's all the way through construction and design documents.

783
01:11:17,151 --> 01:11:18,832
Oh, he's saying one.

784
01:11:20,846 --> 01:11:24,408
Anybody have anything besides a one for this?

785
01:11:26,450 --> 01:11:27,010
That's a one.

786
01:11:27,671 --> 01:11:32,414
Great.

787
01:11:32,494 --> 01:11:36,456
The ADA improvements at Shiloh Baptist Church.

788
01:11:42,540 --> 01:11:42,900
One, one.

789
01:11:44,642 --> 01:11:46,943
And that is one.

790
01:11:47,904 --> 01:11:48,264
Okay.

791
01:11:51,684 --> 01:11:54,945
Um, and then the affordable housing trust fund.

792
01:12:01,147 --> 01:12:01,807
And say 1.

793
01:12:01,847 --> 01:12:09,449
I, sorry, I missed I missed the head nerd discussion because I was just hitting my kid.

794
01:12:09,469 --> 01:12:09,889
Good night.

795
01:12:10,289 --> 01:12:15,431
Um, but I was concerned about that presentation.

796
01:12:15,971 --> 01:12:18,091
Um, yeah, because of how.

797
01:12:21,036 --> 01:12:27,179
Kind of, like, remember exactly what the concerns are, but it felt like it was going to be a multimillion dollar project.

798
01:12:27,259 --> 01:12:29,080
We weren't going to be able to get that amount of funding.

799
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:31,601
So we're trying to break it up into, like, bite size chunks.

800
01:12:32,401 --> 01:12:37,623
But the bite size chunks to me didn't necessarily seem like they had the forethought of.

801
01:12:39,104 --> 01:12:40,865
What was to come with that building?

802
01:12:42,005 --> 01:12:47,088
For example, like the need for an elevator for future use for the upstairs, that kind of thing.

803
01:12:47,288 --> 01:12:52,111
And so I just wanted to highlight that concern on that project.

804
01:12:54,813 --> 01:13:02,437
And I mean, all will be presenting again, the window, the city council window project at our next meeting.

805
01:13:02,937 --> 01:13:10,442
So I can ask him perhaps to bring some additional information about that to maybe set a better timeline of

806
01:13:11,570 --> 01:13:15,373
was I remind me refresh my memory did.

807
01:13:15,653 --> 01:13:28,561
So I remember that there was the feasibility study that had been for a different project at a different time, but it identified the condition of all the different aspects of the building, which was really useful information.

808
01:13:30,623 --> 01:13:38,328
Did the application give an indication of what are the minimum improvements needed to open the center today?

809
01:13:39,685 --> 01:13:50,228
So they basically, if I remember the presentation correctly, they were like, we want to use the first floor for afterschool programming by the rec department.

810
01:13:50,308 --> 01:13:55,350
So not an actual afterschool program, but like afterschool programming and then a couple like administrative offices.

811
01:13:55,370 --> 01:13:56,290
Am I remembering that right?

812
01:13:57,130 --> 01:13:57,770
That is correct.

813
01:13:58,010 --> 01:14:01,711
And there was like no plan, no plan for the second floor.

814
01:14:01,731 --> 01:14:03,052
Like that was like TBD.

815
01:14:03,072 --> 01:14:04,052
Correct.

816
01:14:04,452 --> 01:14:05,812
That was a little concerning to me.

817
01:14:08,280 --> 01:14:17,883
I don't want to speak for Director Reggie, but if I recall, they have received an MVP, which is Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness grant from the city.

818
01:14:17,903 --> 01:14:24,386
And I think that that is necessitating the timeline a bit too, because they have to spend that within a certain time.

819
01:14:24,786 --> 01:14:33,189
So I think that's why he was breaking it up into phases, because they have to take action on that $850,000 that they got through this grant on a time frame.

820
01:14:33,209 --> 01:14:36,050
So that's why they were going to focus on the interior work.

821
01:14:36,687 --> 01:14:39,789
on the first floor to get that to standard and then down the road.

822
01:14:39,809 --> 01:14:43,251
And I also want, I'm sorry, go ahead.

823
01:14:43,831 --> 01:14:45,032
No, it just makes me wonder.

824
01:14:45,092 --> 01:14:46,533
I remember that too, Teresa.

825
01:14:46,553 --> 01:14:48,954
And I think I don't see a reason not to fund it.

826
01:14:49,054 --> 01:14:51,976
It's just like, I was a little concerned hearing that presentation.

827
01:14:52,036 --> 01:14:59,601
It makes me wonder whether this is one of those places that we can provide, I don't know, funding or

828
01:15:00,521 --> 01:15:18,864
the support in, like, thinking through what the long-term plan for the building is, because the idea of having, after all this time, having the Heckner back online, but, like, only using half of it, it's just a little, like, upsetting, and that there's no actual plan to use the second half of it.

829
01:15:20,024 --> 01:15:22,865
It feels, like, not great.

830
01:15:22,885 --> 01:15:23,485
I don't know.

831
01:15:29,715 --> 01:15:32,457
I wasn't here for the earlier tent this evening.

832
01:15:32,557 --> 01:15:34,119
No, this was last month.

833
01:15:34,539 --> 01:15:35,239
OK.

834
01:15:35,540 --> 01:15:36,901
So I wrote some notes.

835
01:15:37,081 --> 01:15:37,441
Yeah.

836
01:15:38,182 --> 01:15:49,511
And I thought that we might want to place some conditions on them for various reasons and some of the reasons that they just talked about.

837
01:15:50,351 --> 01:15:57,137
And we're talking about they already received some funding sources other than us.

838
01:16:00,067 --> 01:16:19,841
but I too have concerns as to using half the building and not having the second floor being ADA compliant because everybody that comes to us knows that if you have a building remodeled or revitalized, that you have to have it ADA compliant.

839
01:16:20,382 --> 01:16:23,024
And that wasn't even talked about, that wasn't even discussed.

840
01:16:24,705 --> 01:16:29,028
So it seems like the plan is flawed.

841
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:51,173
So I want to open up the possibility of considering that the building might be opened in stages, and we don't know yet when are they going to be able to come back and ask for the funding for the elevator.

842
01:16:51,213 --> 01:16:58,258
The Shiloh building is of a similar scale, so a similar kind of Lula elevator might be

843
01:17:01,046 --> 01:17:04,267
the way that they could get that building to be totally.

844
01:17:04,707 --> 01:17:20,892
And so after paying for between the three different funding tranches that have gone to Shiloh, it will end up being about a million dollar project to put in an elevator and even just a Lula.

845
01:17:23,052 --> 01:17:40,308
You know, all things considered, maybe it might be less depending on the what the placement is, what the building structure is like, but I've seen a number of projects that are able to proceed.

846
01:17:40,851 --> 01:17:56,984
in a phased manner, fixing different systems of the building over time so that they're ultimately within five years able to have a fully accessible elevator accessible building, but they start one system at a time to get to that.

847
01:17:57,504 --> 01:18:01,628
So I feel like the elevator doesn't have to be the first

848
01:18:02,647 --> 01:18:03,548
It's the choice.

849
01:18:03,868 --> 01:18:08,810
It would be helpful if there was a commitment to add an elevator in the future.

850
01:18:08,830 --> 01:18:11,832
I think that's the thing, Roberta.

851
01:18:12,072 --> 01:18:15,154
Having a plan in phases, I think we can all get behind.

852
01:18:15,634 --> 01:18:19,676
But when he came to do the presentation, the lack of plan was what really struck me.

853
01:18:20,517 --> 01:18:28,241
And that was really disappointing as just a person that's been watching the Heckner and wanting to make the most of it.

854
01:18:30,150 --> 01:18:31,050
That's my thought on that.

855
01:18:31,291 --> 01:18:38,014
I would love to fund multiple phases of this over time, but I would also love for there to be a vision around that.

856
01:18:39,294 --> 01:18:39,534
Great.

857
01:18:39,674 --> 01:18:54,321
And so I think maybe conditions on this project would be that the design plans will incorporate the eventual construction of an elevator.

858
01:18:55,914 --> 01:19:02,495
Number one, number two, that the ground floor has to be fully handicapped accessible.

859
01:19:02,775 --> 01:19:14,458
You know, we're not going to put CPA funds into a building that isn't meeting the code for the part of the building that's being used.

860
01:19:23,380 --> 01:19:24,700
Thank you all for that discussion.

861
01:19:28,823 --> 01:19:56,614
so we were at affordable housing trust for the prioritization i think everybody said one there yeah one i would consider increasing i was going to wonder that so the committee would have a choice so we could increase the amount that we offer to the affordable housing trust or we could

862
01:19:57,643 --> 01:20:06,069
reserve that $100,000 of capacity for an off-cycle application over the course of this year.

863
01:20:06,569 --> 01:20:13,915
Both of those are very worthwhile eventualities.

864
01:20:14,535 --> 01:20:23,942
Do you know, did they come up with the 250 proposed amount or was that something that we might have

865
01:20:24,770 --> 01:20:29,652
I might have suggested it, just based off of what I knew we had for budget.

866
01:20:29,672 --> 01:20:36,996
So the $250,000 kind of just came from an organic discussion between myself and the housing planner.

867
01:20:37,644 --> 01:20:42,730
But I clearly recall Kayleen, whenever she was presenting, saying like, you should be asking for more.

868
01:20:42,790 --> 01:20:49,719
So if this or... Yeah, I mean, I definitely support giving more, like a good faith, you know, for them.

869
01:20:49,839 --> 01:20:56,066
And I mean, being the Medford housing rep, I mean, and just with the work I do in Lexington, like the affordable housing trustee.

870
01:20:57,668 --> 01:20:58,248
really pivotal.

871
01:21:00,249 --> 01:21:02,891
But whatever, I mean, we can even just, what are they asking for?

872
01:21:02,911 --> 01:21:03,631
350 or 250?

873
01:21:04,051 --> 01:21:08,293
Yeah, so either 250, maybe go to 300.

874
01:21:08,393 --> 01:21:13,636
In the awarded column, the next column to the right.

875
01:21:14,236 --> 01:21:17,918
Yeah, there, that way we keep track of what they asked for versus what we offer.

876
01:21:18,358 --> 01:21:19,139
Okay.

877
01:21:19,159 --> 01:21:24,701
We're going to offer more than... That's what we're just... Potentially.

878
01:21:24,721 --> 01:21:24,941
Yeah.

879
01:21:27,620 --> 01:21:34,843
I mean, I support that, but I'd also just support keeping money in our back pocket, too.

880
01:21:35,364 --> 01:21:37,385
I like the idea of funding them well.

881
01:21:37,565 --> 01:21:48,190
On the other hand, I walked away from that presentation a little bit unclear what they were intending to do exactly with it.

882
01:21:48,830 --> 01:21:54,453
It felt like they were still in like a, we could do this, or we could do that, or we could do this, or we could do that kind of place.

883
01:21:57,840 --> 01:21:58,982
just kind of putting that out there.

884
01:21:59,923 --> 01:22:04,949
I don't know how much clarity we want from them if we're going to be giving them more than they asked for.

885
01:22:09,232 --> 01:22:14,016
I think the whole idea about the Affordable Housing Trust is that they have work to do.

886
01:22:14,076 --> 01:22:17,739
They have to figure out what they're going to do and they're just starting out.

887
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:24,444
It's not like they won't use the money for affordable housing at some point.

888
01:22:24,484 --> 01:22:33,631
The question is, do we want to give them the money now or do we want to save it for another application that may come off cycle or something along those lines?

889
01:22:33,911 --> 01:22:34,191
Right.

890
01:22:34,211 --> 01:22:38,114
Do we want to wait for them to have more of a clear portfolio like X percent?

891
01:22:38,574 --> 01:22:45,599
We'll be spending on this, this year, and I don't know how it works, but it felt very nebulous in the presentation.

892
01:22:47,060 --> 01:22:58,208
I think that over the years, the affordable housing, um, tranche, if you will, has not gotten the love that the others have gotten because we just simply haven't gotten the applications.

893
01:22:58,669 --> 01:22:58,869
Yeah.

894
01:22:59,189 --> 01:23:03,072
So I, at the beginning, we were kind of, um, you know,

895
01:23:03,782 --> 01:23:14,405
Feeling bad that, you know, although we were trying to distribute money equally amongst the three different areas, housing was not getting the same amount because we weren't getting the application.

896
01:23:14,445 --> 01:23:16,526
So, something to think about too.

897
01:23:16,566 --> 01:23:19,707
They haven't gotten as much as the others have gotten over the years.

898
01:23:21,507 --> 01:23:21,667
Yeah.

899
01:23:21,687 --> 01:23:22,988
So, can I ask a question?

900
01:23:23,048 --> 01:23:26,349
How are we breaking it down by the three groups that we have now?

901
01:23:26,589 --> 01:23:29,810
I mean, I'm not being able to see such.

902
01:23:29,990 --> 01:23:30,330
Yeah.

903
01:23:30,590 --> 01:23:31,931
What is the percentage?

904
01:23:31,951 --> 01:23:33,191
Do we know?

905
01:23:34,025 --> 01:23:38,748
And it did percentage or just in totals by category.

906
01:23:38,768 --> 01:23:40,549
So.

907
01:23:41,670 --> 01:23:43,331
I should probably sit closer to the screen.

908
01:23:43,371 --> 01:23:46,973
Do you have amount to date on this?

909
01:23:49,015 --> 01:23:50,275
Are you highlighting that?

910
01:23:50,916 --> 01:23:51,556
That's not it.

911
01:23:52,036 --> 01:23:52,377
Yeah.

912
01:23:52,697 --> 01:23:54,978
These are the asks per category.

913
01:23:55,018 --> 01:23:55,299
So.

914
01:23:55,979 --> 01:23:56,199
Right.

915
01:23:56,219 --> 01:24:03,684
But I mean, do we have the amounts per date per section since the beginning of the CBA program?

916
01:24:05,220 --> 01:24:06,021
We don't have that.

917
01:24:06,081 --> 01:24:07,682
I don't have it right in front of me.

918
01:24:07,762 --> 01:24:27,755
But last year, or actually, technically earlier this year, when we went on a little bit of a CPA outreach campaign, where we did identify how we distributed CPA funds in its totality since the program began.

919
01:24:27,775 --> 01:24:31,518
And we were right about neck and neck, a third, a third, and a third.

920
01:24:32,418 --> 01:24:35,619
Open space was a little bit higher, like 39-ish percent.

921
01:24:36,340 --> 01:24:42,262
But so we have distributed roughly a third of our funds towards housing.

922
01:24:42,862 --> 01:24:50,805
Those were just kind of big chunks, you know, like the walkway courts, pre-development costs, which was about $1.9 million that we awarded to them.

923
01:24:50,825 --> 01:24:54,907
You know, fellows like Wes got about $650,000 CPA dollars.

924
01:24:58,504 --> 01:25:03,967
The money has been distributed equally, I would say, but perhaps not by number of projects.

925
01:25:04,628 --> 01:25:08,730
Yeah, definitely have done the products, but you're right.

926
01:25:08,790 --> 01:25:09,971
Lockling court was a big 1.

927
01:25:10,890 --> 01:25:34,277
Another thing about this being the first year seeding the Affordable Housing Trust is we could go big and give them more money so that they can accrue interest or whatnot and then have the condition be like next year when you come to like re-up your funds, provide a little bit more of like a portfolio of like

928
01:25:35,299 --> 01:25:38,020
this is where we're planning to designate such and such funds.

929
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:44,863
So we'd be giving them the benefit of the doubt so they can be accruing interest, but like having a little bit of a conditionality to it.

930
01:25:45,804 --> 01:25:47,665
Yeah.

931
01:25:47,765 --> 01:25:58,209
And in her presentation at DT Magor, she had shared that they had their two major projects in the trust pocket right now.

932
01:25:58,229 --> 01:26:02,971
One is to create a declaration of trust and the other was to

933
01:26:04,777 --> 01:26:06,779
Create a plan, create an action plan.

934
01:26:06,799 --> 01:26:07,259
Thank you.

935
01:26:08,820 --> 01:26:15,366
Then that will help guide them in their, their quarterly goals or monthly tasks or what have you.

936
01:26:16,226 --> 01:26:23,032
She had identified a couple of possible projects of how to spend the money in terms of courting.

937
01:26:23,918 --> 01:26:35,269
Nonprofit affordable housing developers with some of our city owned lots right now, but to your point, it's not like a definitive we're going to take this to 50 and distributed here amongst these things so.

938
01:26:36,674 --> 01:26:38,516
And I kind of agree with Ada.

939
01:26:38,736 --> 01:26:47,362
I mean, why don't we just let them get a year under their belt and get that action plan, and then maybe next year we give them a little more, you know?

940
01:26:47,382 --> 01:26:56,069
I think maybe it being not so, like, their plan not being so clear, let's just keep the $150 or whatever in our pocket for now.

941
01:26:56,089 --> 01:26:56,910
Okay.

942
01:26:58,751 --> 01:27:01,393
And one thing other communities such as Somerville

943
01:27:01,938 --> 01:27:05,500
What they do is they automatically, I believe it's 50%, right?

944
01:27:05,580 --> 01:27:09,522
Of your annual budget just goes right into their board of housing trust.

945
01:27:11,143 --> 01:27:16,566
For them to kind of tackle the housing portion of what CPA can do.

946
01:27:16,586 --> 01:27:21,888
So that's something that we could discuss as a committee of taking that on as a best practice.

947
01:27:21,908 --> 01:27:23,149
50% of what?

948
01:27:27,547 --> 01:27:39,934
So the Somerville, Somerville CPC allocates half of their revenue every year to affordable housing.

949
01:27:41,215 --> 01:27:45,778
And so right now we're doing like a third right now.

950
01:27:45,838 --> 01:27:48,239
Yeah, we're like right now we're doing the 90 percent.

951
01:27:52,131 --> 01:27:56,193
Yeah, well, 19% would be what we spend if we bumped it up by 100,000.

952
01:27:56,233 --> 01:27:59,654
It would be 14% if we didn't.

953
01:28:00,014 --> 01:28:04,896
But right now we're just doing the basic 10, 10, 10.

954
01:28:06,837 --> 01:28:17,602
Sometimes we bump up the housing by maybe it's 10, 10, 20, but like we've made that decision on a year to year basis.

955
01:28:18,432 --> 01:28:22,293
Um, Summerville technically does too, it's just that every year they choose 50%.

956
01:28:23,254 --> 01:28:27,375
Um, so... So that's really different.

957
01:28:27,455 --> 01:28:31,596
So, they really don't have a track record here.

958
01:28:31,636 --> 01:28:33,417
Right, and that's the thing.

959
01:28:33,457 --> 01:28:42,900
Because they don't have a track record, why, in my estimation, why would we give them additional funding when they've asked for $250,000, right?

960
01:28:42,980 --> 01:28:43,280
Right.

961
01:28:43,560 --> 01:28:43,680
And...

962
01:28:45,803 --> 01:28:53,247
they probably don't exactly have an action plan in place or even thought out yet.

963
01:28:55,388 --> 01:28:56,748
And if they thought that the $250,000 was adequate,

964
01:29:02,446 --> 01:29:03,267
Yeah, I agree.

965
01:29:03,808 --> 01:29:15,065
I think what Roberta was getting, the point you were getting to, like for the Somerville example, is that agencies like Somerville Housing, they don't go to CPC for money.

966
01:29:15,245 --> 01:29:17,749
They just go straight to the housing trust, correct?

967
01:29:18,717 --> 01:29:18,897
Yeah.

968
01:29:18,917 --> 01:29:20,898
So the same thing is happening right now in Lexington.

969
01:29:20,938 --> 01:29:33,362
There's a, that CPC is having a huge discussion about what to do with the HT and, um, like the future for, you know, me as a director, well, I not have the ability to go to CPC anymore.

970
01:29:33,522 --> 01:29:35,923
I might just go into the housing trust, you know, there's pros and cons.

971
01:29:36,263 --> 01:29:45,807
Um, but yeah, I mean, I agree with, but, uh, what you're saying, I think just give them the two 50, but then some, you know, miles under them and then go from there.

972
01:29:50,240 --> 01:29:55,907
I just fixed the percentages down here.

973
01:29:57,389 --> 01:29:58,491
I felt a little weird about that 99.9.

974
01:29:58,611 --> 01:30:01,314
I don't know where that came from.

975
01:30:01,335 --> 01:30:01,855
Anybody else?

976
01:30:05,342 --> 01:30:10,084
I mean, maybe they can give us a better budget, but I was like, well, what money have you spent?

977
01:30:10,464 --> 01:30:11,524
What's left over?

978
01:30:11,624 --> 01:30:16,546
Like, could we just give them another 30 or 60 and then have them come back next year?

979
01:30:16,566 --> 01:30:20,307
I felt a little weird about their ability to spend.

980
01:30:20,627 --> 01:30:20,947
Yeah.

981
01:30:21,128 --> 01:30:21,388
Yeah.

982
01:30:21,408 --> 01:30:21,648
Sorry.

983
01:30:21,668 --> 01:30:22,208
I jumped ahead.

984
01:30:22,288 --> 01:30:23,949
So it's almost my bedtime, guys.

985
01:30:24,289 --> 01:30:32,912
They increased their base request from 60 to 75 and then that

986
01:30:35,755 --> 01:30:37,376
23 to increase all the other.

987
01:30:37,857 --> 01:30:45,102
Yeah, they're being counters so they went right down to the penny to see how much it would cost to have a salaried person support the program.

988
01:30:46,183 --> 01:30:47,444
But yeah, they should just rounded it up.

989
01:30:47,764 --> 01:30:52,087
Yeah, but I don't even know if they need that much money.

990
01:30:53,629 --> 01:31:04,177
But I mean, if they spent their funding in two years instead of three years, they could always come back early.

991
01:31:04,966 --> 01:31:10,768
They don't have to wait three years.

992
01:31:11,229 --> 01:31:21,653
They're anticipating that they'll spend this down in three years, but I'd like to see them accelerate that because I think there are more than that number of people who need help.

993
01:31:23,024 --> 01:31:24,244
not getting it for some reason.

994
01:31:24,264 --> 01:31:26,325
Yeah, I felt like their outreach wasn't that strong.

995
01:31:27,726 --> 01:31:32,107
I could email her right now, like, four contacts that went for housing, like direct, you know what I mean?

996
01:31:32,147 --> 01:31:33,748
Be like, you guys should contact them.

997
01:31:34,168 --> 01:31:37,689
I'm sure they have a list of rent arrears that need to be paid, you know?

998
01:31:38,970 --> 01:31:40,790
Yeah, yeah.

999
01:31:41,110 --> 01:31:42,591
I felt the same way about the outreach.

1000
01:31:42,611 --> 01:31:44,232
It was a little concerning to me.

1001
01:31:46,859 --> 01:31:56,067
I think she did say tonight, though, that part of this additional admin expenses were to help supplement their marketing program.

1002
01:31:56,227 --> 01:31:58,509
She did say that they've been trying to market it more.

1003
01:31:59,650 --> 01:32:02,112
But perhaps we could put that as a condition.

1004
01:32:02,132 --> 01:32:03,534
You get what you pay for.

1005
01:32:03,554 --> 01:32:10,480
And I'm hoping that if we pay for more admin, they will do more work on our behalf.

1006
01:32:11,721 --> 01:32:30,056
What if there's a condition around the outreach, like, on the condition that you maintain ongoing dialogue with, like, such and such agencies in Medford, you know, to Kayleen's point, like, to make sure that there's communication?

1007
01:32:30,076 --> 01:32:37,142
Because, I mean, there's marketing, but then there's just, like, knowing who to talk to in the city.

1008
01:32:37,823 --> 01:32:38,563
You know what I mean?

1009
01:32:40,042 --> 01:32:40,302
Right.

1010
01:32:40,422 --> 01:32:48,225
And it feels like even if you're marketing, if you don't have those relationships, like you're not going to be getting that steady stream of people coming in.

1011
01:32:50,285 --> 01:32:54,787
I'll wordsmith us a couple of variations of the condition that address that.

1012
01:32:55,247 --> 01:32:58,568
So then when we vote next, next month, I'll have those options ready.

1013
01:32:58,628 --> 01:33:02,729
But I think we can figure out some sort of conditioning around engagement.

1014
01:33:02,749 --> 01:33:05,690
Yeah.

1015
01:33:07,211 --> 01:33:07,791
Appreciate that.

1016
01:33:08,651 --> 01:33:13,314
All right, so that's a one from everyone, I assume.

1017
01:33:14,495 --> 01:33:22,561
OK, so it looks like we don't have any argument against funding all the projects as requested.

1018
01:33:23,241 --> 01:33:29,986
We did promise to vote on the one project this evening before we depart.

1019
01:33:30,386 --> 01:33:31,287
You did miss that, Rich.

1020
01:33:31,697 --> 01:33:31,977
Yes.

1021
01:33:32,117 --> 01:33:39,560
We had the mayor came to ask us to expedite the decision on the Riverside Plaza project.

1022
01:33:39,940 --> 01:33:48,102
Oh, that's due to they have a matching grant with obligations that have a deadline that's precipitating the urgent request.

1023
01:33:49,183 --> 01:33:51,183
Yeah, I kind of know about that one.

1024
01:33:51,724 --> 01:33:52,124
Okay.

1025
01:33:53,284 --> 01:33:56,705
So the request is for $144,250.

1026
01:33:59,710 --> 01:34:03,472
Do you want to pull up, Teresa, the letter?

1027
01:34:03,532 --> 01:34:06,913
Do you want a motion?

1028
01:34:06,933 --> 01:34:08,153
Are you going to look at the letter?

1029
01:34:08,193 --> 01:34:08,454
Yes.

1030
01:34:08,474 --> 01:34:11,215
I'm looking for a motion, but I want to just pull up the letter.

1031
01:34:11,255 --> 01:34:13,856
I think there are no conditions in our draft.

1032
01:34:13,876 --> 01:34:16,337
I do not have conditions.

1033
01:34:16,357 --> 01:34:19,118
The only thing about the letter, it doesn't say the amount they're asking for.

1034
01:34:19,138 --> 01:34:21,999
I mean, I see it in our chart, but I had to dig for it.

1035
01:34:22,359 --> 01:34:23,139
But it doesn't matter.

1036
01:34:23,160 --> 01:34:24,020
I'll make the motion.

1037
01:34:24,040 --> 01:34:25,120
Wasn't it in change in the letter?

1038
01:34:31,258 --> 01:34:33,459
No.

1039
01:34:33,479 --> 01:34:34,840
The table was 144,250.

1040
01:34:34,900 --> 01:34:38,742
Yeah, it was for this time.

1041
01:34:38,762 --> 01:34:40,123
Oh, okay.

1042
01:34:40,243 --> 01:34:41,824
So yeah, it should still be in there.

1043
01:34:41,844 --> 01:34:42,164
You're right.

1044
01:34:42,184 --> 01:34:44,246
There should be a sign.

1045
01:34:48,188 --> 01:34:48,848
Yeah.

1046
01:34:48,868 --> 01:34:56,032
Then the one condition that I wanted to consider adding as a general condition is

1047
01:34:58,303 --> 01:35:19,317
To say that if the, if the improvements, if the CPC funded improvements are discontinued within so many years, the city will reimburse the CPC, the CPA fund.

1048
01:35:20,598 --> 01:35:22,359
How would that work since this is a match?

1049
01:35:22,379 --> 01:35:26,862
You can't necessarily tie the CPA funds.

1050
01:35:27,590 --> 01:35:35,113
It means that if in five years they decide to tear down the shade structures that we built, they have to put the money back in the CPA account.

1051
01:35:35,133 --> 01:35:38,355
The park doesn't have to do that.

1052
01:35:38,815 --> 01:35:47,098
When you talked about that project, you had told them that you thought that they should put in a base layer.

1053
01:35:47,599 --> 01:35:48,559
Is that included in that?

1054
01:35:49,532 --> 01:35:55,656
Um, it will be so they, they, they need part of the funding is going to go to completing the design.

1055
01:35:56,396 --> 01:36:02,500
And so they're going to put that as 1 of the things that they want to include in their final design.

1056
01:36:05,475 --> 01:36:12,203
I understand your intent with that, Roberta, but I just have a real hard time with putting constraints like that.

1057
01:36:12,623 --> 01:36:18,170
It's really hard to know what's going to happen in five years or ten years or whatever down the road.

1058
01:36:19,171 --> 01:36:19,451
I don't know.

1059
01:36:19,491 --> 01:36:22,494
I feel like we just have to give them the benefit of the doubt and the good faith that

1060
01:36:23,798 --> 01:36:34,760
So where this is coming from is that we've had projects in the past, including Manfred Housing Authority, which requested funds for the Bocce courts.

1061
01:36:34,780 --> 01:36:41,422
So I have information, very good information, that they never actually got CPC funding for that.

1062
01:36:41,562 --> 01:36:43,702
And that was completely paid for by Manfred Housing.

1063
01:36:43,842 --> 01:36:45,863
For the Bocce courts?

1064
01:36:45,883 --> 01:36:45,923
OK.

1065
01:36:50,193 --> 01:36:51,614
Y'all need to take that one back.

1066
01:36:52,916 --> 01:36:57,821
They got awarded, but you never paid for it by you, but it never got reimbursed or whatever.

1067
01:36:57,841 --> 01:36:59,303
That is true.

1068
01:36:59,483 --> 01:36:59,743
Okay.

1069
01:37:01,065 --> 01:37:01,285
All right.

1070
01:37:02,006 --> 01:37:03,988
But I understand what the intent is.

1071
01:37:04,008 --> 01:37:07,051
I just, I'm not sure what kind of precedent and setting, because like...

1072
01:37:08,345 --> 01:37:20,248
Let's say you did pay for the Medford housing, but then five years down the road, they get $65 million to reduce all install, and they need to take away the BACU courts for parking.

1073
01:37:20,368 --> 01:37:24,569
Sorry, BACU courts, but this creating, I'm just saying, I don't know.

1074
01:37:24,609 --> 01:37:33,932
It's a hard thing for an agency to know or forecast with that stipulation, but without it being a little bit more specific.

1075
01:37:34,886 --> 01:37:35,166
Yeah.

1076
01:37:35,606 --> 01:37:35,947
That's all.

1077
01:37:35,987 --> 01:37:36,727
That's my two cents.

1078
01:37:36,767 --> 01:37:37,107
I don't know.

1079
01:37:37,207 --> 01:37:38,868
I mean, I just felt like I needed to say that.

1080
01:37:44,971 --> 01:37:48,632
I'm just riffing.

1081
01:37:48,772 --> 01:37:49,333
I'll see what.

1082
01:37:49,353 --> 01:38:03,039
I mean, it could also happen with improvements made to the schoolyards, for example, that

1083
01:38:03,610 --> 01:38:22,724
We fund $900,000 worth of improvements to a schoolyard, and in five years, the school department decides to build an addition to the school building that completely eliminates the schoolyard that we just paid for.

1084
01:38:27,593 --> 01:38:39,819
I mean, obviously they have to do what they have to do, but would we request that they reimburse the cost of the improvements that they've just undone?

1085
01:38:41,900 --> 01:38:54,387
Roberta, I guess my two cents is, I think it's a little different when the city of Medicare is doing it than others, just because we are all the city of Medicare, you know, when we decide to change gears or,

1086
01:38:55,380 --> 01:38:57,942
do something different with a park or a building.

1087
01:38:58,983 --> 01:39:04,888
It's with the knowledge that we spent money, maybe not great money on previous things.

1088
01:39:05,188 --> 01:39:11,973
A lot of band-aids happened in the city and then we invested in something like a new fire station, not anymore, but the police station.

1089
01:39:12,974 --> 01:39:13,735
These things happen.

1090
01:39:14,535 --> 01:39:25,064
I don't see the need, I guess, for the city of Medford's conditions here because I don't see a track record of them doing anything over five and plus years that would

1091
01:39:25,768 --> 01:39:26,669
go for it so far.

1092
01:39:29,070 --> 01:39:34,434
Okay.

1093
01:39:35,194 --> 01:39:44,741
Well, I hear that we're satisfied without making any conditions on this project then.

1094
01:39:44,761 --> 01:39:47,643
Yeah.

1095
01:39:47,743 --> 01:39:47,903
Okay.

1096
01:39:51,621 --> 01:40:07,790
But you said that other piece, the flooring was going to be part and parcel of it because we wanted to make sure that we kept the rodents from that wooden platform or whatever.

1097
01:40:08,070 --> 01:40:13,633
Because they were going to put the wooden platform in and they were going to put the structures because it's coming to us next.

1098
01:40:14,434 --> 01:40:16,695
So we just had a conversation with Amanda

1099
01:40:17,897 --> 01:40:24,824
right before you came, and she reiterated that she'd like to get more information about that to work with the designers.

1100
01:40:25,305 --> 01:40:34,634
So it sounds as though she's committed to implementing some kind of rat prevention.

1101
01:40:34,654 --> 01:40:40,279
I don't know if we need to include that in our recommendation that goes to city council.

1102
01:40:43,858 --> 01:40:51,603
I guess, I mean, it was just it was just a suggestion to you all right to the commission.

1103
01:40:51,623 --> 01:40:56,287
Yes, but we don't we don't we don't we don't go that deep into it.

1104
01:40:56,507 --> 01:40:58,308
Yeah, we don't want to the.

1105
01:40:59,989 --> 01:41:09,996
Project of itself, we just maybe in the disbursement schedule that would be in the so there's a decision and then the agreement where applicants sign it with us and blah, blah, blah.

1106
01:41:10,582 --> 01:41:17,368
So perhaps we can outline something in the disbursement schedule of, you know, subject to a final design or something.

1107
01:41:17,448 --> 01:41:17,909
I'm not sure.

1108
01:41:17,929 --> 01:41:24,154
I'm just trying to think of another way to reiterate some of our paperwork that we want to see that.

1109
01:41:25,215 --> 01:41:36,986
Maybe just like my suggestion with the shell, the lighting improvements of the convent shell was to put it somewhere in the project description.

1110
01:41:37,066 --> 01:41:37,226
Right.

1111
01:41:37,736 --> 01:41:50,982
So we could maybe for this one say in the project description that the Riverside Plaza Shade Structures project, which will include rat prevention technology.

1112
01:41:52,763 --> 01:41:54,644
So that is iterated somewhere.

1113
01:41:55,700 --> 01:42:15,770
Yeah, so it could be iterated maybe in the memorandum of agreement there might be a one paragraph description of the project that includes it's going to have so many shades and it's going to have a boardwalk and the boardwalk is going to include rat prevention, rodent prevention or whatever we want to say.

1114
01:42:16,130 --> 01:42:18,531
Okay, I'm satisfied with that.

1115
01:42:20,512 --> 01:42:21,233
So Joan?

1116
01:42:23,634 --> 01:42:23,874
Yes.

1117
01:42:25,612 --> 01:42:29,593
We're waiting for you to make a motion.

1118
01:42:29,953 --> 01:42:35,415
Yes, I make a motion to approve the application for the Riverside Plaza.

1119
01:42:35,435 --> 01:42:38,156
I recommend 144,254 signs.

1120
01:42:38,176 --> 01:42:39,036
And someone seconded it.

1121
01:42:39,096 --> 01:42:39,376
Reg did.

1122
01:42:39,396 --> 01:42:39,676
Kayleen.

1123
01:42:39,696 --> 01:42:40,356
Oh, Kayleen, sorry.

1124
01:42:40,376 --> 01:42:42,577
I can't see you all.

1125
01:42:43,957 --> 01:42:45,237
Kayleen seconded it.

1126
01:42:45,297 --> 01:42:45,958
I will call the roll.

1127
01:42:55,357 --> 01:42:56,518
Um, Joan?

1128
01:42:57,159 --> 01:42:57,459
Yes.

1129
01:42:58,620 --> 01:42:59,120
Haylene?

1130
01:43:01,282 --> 01:43:01,522
Yes.

1131
01:43:02,623 --> 01:43:02,783

1132
01:43:03,244 --> 01:43:03,484
Yeah.

Yes.

1135
01:43:06,826 --> 01:43:07,127

Yes.

1137
01:43:11,350 --> 01:43:11,890

1138
01:43:12,030 --> 01:43:12,271
Yes.

1139
01:43:12,791 --> 01:43:13,632
And myself, yes.

1140
01:43:14,753 --> 01:43:16,074
Thanks.

1141
01:43:17,635 --> 01:43:19,456
On behalf of the city of Medford, thank you very much.

1142
01:43:22,645 --> 01:43:25,226
And that is all the business that we need to cover today.

1143
01:43:26,207 --> 01:43:26,607
Minutes.

1144
01:43:27,687 --> 01:43:28,648
Do we want to approve minutes?

1145
01:43:28,668 --> 01:43:30,168
Do we want to save that for the next meeting?

1146
01:43:30,248 --> 01:43:31,989
I know it's after eight now, so.

1147
01:43:32,009 --> 01:43:33,570
All right.

1148
01:43:34,510 --> 01:43:35,310
I'm just piling up.

1149
01:43:35,330 --> 01:43:41,453
I'll make a motion if you want to.

1150
01:43:42,093 --> 01:43:47,155
Motion to accept the minutes for both meetings.

1151
01:43:47,856 --> 01:43:48,476

Yeah, Ari.

One of us.

1175
01:44:33,613 --> 01:44:34,393
It wasn't me.

1176
01:44:34,953 --> 01:44:36,073
I just teased everyone.

1177
01:44:36,093 --> 01:44:39,474
All right, Joan?

1178
01:44:40,575 --> 01:44:40,795
Yes.

1179
01:44:41,635 --> 01:44:42,155
