11
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:58,152
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, member so.

12
00:00:58,632 --> 00:01:02,598
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember, I felt present number Graham presence.

13
00:01:02,678 --> 00:01:04,681
[SPEAKER_04]: So, 3 present 0 absent.

14
00:01:05,282 --> 00:01:06,924
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, okay.

15
00:01:06,944 --> 00:01:10,529
[SPEAKER_04]: So our agenda for today is just to, um.

16
00:01:11,718 --> 00:01:21,361
[SPEAKER_04]: Get ready, uh, to present our capital plan for the upcoming year through our established budget process for capital planning.

17
00:01:22,402 --> 00:01:28,604
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and we're roughly targeting the 2nd meeting in December, which is December 15th.

18
00:01:28,744 --> 00:01:35,666
[SPEAKER_04]: Although if everything, like, ties up in a bow, and we want to do it at the next meeting, we can talk about that based on what else is on the agenda.

19
00:01:37,952 --> 00:02:04,618
[SPEAKER_04]: And by way of a little bit of background for anybody listening, um, for the last couple of years, we have, um, tried to kick off capital planning in this, like, no October, November timeframe so that we can collect all of the input, um, and have a cohesive conversation about priorities, bring that forward to the school committee for like agreement and adoption and turn it over to the city.

20
00:02:05,726 --> 00:02:18,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, council and the mayor's office, um, by early next year, so that when they are looking at capital projects, and as pre cash gets certified, which tends to happen in the spring here in Medford.

21
00:02:18,771 --> 00:02:24,753
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, that they know sort of what is hot on a list of things to do.

22
00:02:24,773 --> 00:02:30,136
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and then we can be talking about, like, sort of what's on the critical path, et cetera.

23
00:02:31,076 --> 00:02:33,197
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so this year, uh.

24
00:02:34,149 --> 00:02:42,075
[SPEAKER_04]: with Ken joining us in August, although it feels like a year from August at this point, Ken.

25
00:02:43,356 --> 00:02:58,447
[SPEAKER_04]: He and I met and we talked a little bit about some additional inputs that we have this year that we haven't had before because of the Facility Conditions Assessment Index that was created and completed over the summer where

26
00:02:59,528 --> 00:03:11,885
[SPEAKER_04]: That assessment had somewhere north of 60 or $70 million of capital projects outlined in the next five years anyway.

27
00:03:12,848 --> 00:03:21,398
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, which is a daunting and staggering number, but Ken has done a lot of due diligence to kick us off.

28
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:31,590
[SPEAKER_04]: So my thought for today is we'll have Ken pull up the spread the capital planning spreadsheet and walk us through what he's done to sort of integrate.

29
00:03:32,411 --> 00:03:41,312
[SPEAKER_04]: That facilities condition assessment, because he, he fell into the rabbit hole of the spreadsheet and it's pretty intense now.

30
00:03:41,372 --> 00:03:42,695
[SPEAKER_04]: So I want him to explain that.

31
00:03:43,252 --> 00:03:51,195
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we can talk a little bit about the things that are on the top level of the plan and in the near term.

32
00:03:52,016 --> 00:04:00,439
[SPEAKER_04]: And I do see Teresa has joined us to talk a little bit potentially about CPC oriented projects.

33
00:04:00,499 --> 00:04:01,940
[SPEAKER_04]: So thanks for being here, Teresa.

34
00:04:02,881 --> 00:04:05,982
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Ken, I will turn it over to you if you want to walk us all through this.

35
00:04:06,422 --> 00:04:17,779
[SPEAKER_04]: The spreadsheet and sort of how where all of the facility condition assessment stuff is and how it is all floating up before I do that, though, I will mention to this group.

36
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:33,906
[SPEAKER_04]: that a couple of weeks ago now, we were notified by the MSBA that the three statements of interest that we put in for roofs and HVAC at Mississauga, Roberts, and Brooks were all approved.

37
00:04:34,066 --> 00:04:35,806
[SPEAKER_04]: So we went to the board meeting.

38
00:04:36,367 --> 00:04:37,987
[SPEAKER_04]: Those three projects are all approved.

39
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:42,910
[SPEAKER_04]: So obviously, that's a huge component of that $60 or $70 million, obviously.

40
00:04:46,351 --> 00:04:57,264
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some work that has to happen between now and February that we're sort of working on behind the scenes to to get going, but the priority, like, the order of.

41
00:04:58,065 --> 00:05:05,914
[SPEAKER_04]: Projects there will be Roberts miss a tuck and then Brooks based on the, particularly the aging of the roof and the.

42
00:05:07,123 --> 00:05:07,784
[SPEAKER_04]: HVAC systems.

43
00:05:08,064 --> 00:05:10,146
[SPEAKER_04]: So more to come on that.

44
00:05:10,246 --> 00:05:19,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, those are like on the plan, but those are a little bit different because they're already sort of actively in this MSBA funding pipeline.

45
00:05:19,174 --> 00:05:22,116
[SPEAKER_04]: So all good news, honestly.

46
00:05:22,236 --> 00:05:33,526
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so excited that we were able to get all three of those into the pipeline and not have to wait two more years to even think about talking about some of those things.

47
00:05:33,546 --> 00:05:34,026
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's great.

48
00:05:35,779 --> 00:05:38,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Ken, I'll turn it over to you if you want to walk us through your spreadsheet.

49
00:05:38,962 --> 00:05:41,084
[SPEAKER_01]: You should be able to see the spreadsheet now on your screen.

50
00:05:41,544 --> 00:05:41,704
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

51
00:05:42,405 --> 00:05:43,306
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

52
00:05:43,326 --> 00:05:50,172
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I did was I took the facilities condition assessment report, which is a voluminous document.

53
00:05:51,067 --> 00:05:55,988
[SPEAKER_01]: And I received the Excel versions of this, and I imported it into different tabs.

54
00:05:56,048 --> 00:06:01,209
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the totals page, which shows all the items from the FCA.

55
00:06:01,809 --> 00:06:07,851
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there are tabs for each school, which has all of their items on that sheet.

56
00:06:08,411 --> 00:06:14,672
[SPEAKER_01]: I then went through and I kind of categorized everything for each school in a budget location.

57
00:06:15,418 --> 00:06:20,083
[SPEAKER_01]: Moving them to ARP, which stands for Accelerated Repair Program.

58
00:06:20,123 --> 00:06:22,805
[SPEAKER_01]: That's only for the Brooks, the Roberts, and the Missituk.

59
00:06:23,386 --> 00:06:26,229
[SPEAKER_01]: Doors and windows, electrical fencing, so on and so forth.

60
00:06:26,709 --> 00:06:36,639
[SPEAKER_01]: I also marked a number of them as operating, which are things I felt we might be able to accomplish through our Extraordinary Repairs account or through regular maintenance work.

61
00:06:37,204 --> 00:06:39,465
[SPEAKER_01]: So I categorized everything as best I could for those.

62
00:06:40,945 --> 00:06:44,686
[SPEAKER_01]: Off to the right, you'll see operating tabs for each school.

63
00:06:45,106 --> 00:06:51,567
[SPEAKER_01]: That just pulled all the things that I categorized as operating into one tab so you could review those specifically if you wanted to.

64
00:06:53,648 --> 00:07:03,390
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have did a lot of work on the capital plan document tab, but really what I did after our meeting this week is I made a prioritized list of everything from the capital plan

65
00:07:04,282 --> 00:07:20,116
[SPEAKER_01]: Pulled those pieces of data to this one tab So basically the suggestion I have is of course the ARP projects are the most important these are You see two numbers here.

66
00:07:20,677 --> 00:07:28,484
[SPEAKER_01]: This is for the feasibility study and then the project itself and these are the Medford portions of the amounts and

67
00:07:29,108 --> 00:07:40,541
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have a separate spreadsheet that talks about all the numbers and everything and the square footage and whatnot, and the total project cost that is estimated for the heat pump and roof conversion.

68
00:07:43,805 --> 00:07:47,366
[SPEAKER_01]: projects as well as some ADA work that might fall into there.

69
00:07:48,066 --> 00:07:52,147
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a lot of discussion about what the budget number is for that.

70
00:07:52,527 --> 00:07:56,907
[SPEAKER_01]: The MSBA quotes $150 a square foot, which is what I'm basing this on.

71
00:07:57,688 --> 00:08:07,869
[SPEAKER_01]: I did reach out to Habib, who did the Facilities Connection Assessment Report, and they're getting some information from one of their estimators to see if the $150 really holds true or not.

72
00:08:08,329 --> 00:08:10,930
[SPEAKER_01]: So these numbers here that I have for the

73
00:08:12,311 --> 00:08:17,316
[SPEAKER_01]: Schematic design and the project for the ARP may come down some.

74
00:08:18,457 --> 00:08:29,568
[SPEAKER_01]: Beyond that, I pulled out a number of things from the facilities condition assessment report, as well as from feedback from principals, the fire alarms,

75
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:38,454
[SPEAKER_01]: are listed in the facilities condition assessment report for the five buildings as being aged out, need to be replaced.

76
00:08:39,014 --> 00:08:43,536
[SPEAKER_01]: To do a project like a fire alarm, we really need to have a study done.

77
00:08:43,956 --> 00:08:45,897
[SPEAKER_01]: You need schematic plans done.

78
00:08:45,937 --> 00:08:47,278
[SPEAKER_01]: You need code review.

79
00:08:47,298 --> 00:08:50,239
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not something we could write a specification up for ourselves.

80
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,842
[SPEAKER_01]: I reached out to Habib and asked them to give an estimate for what he thought those might cost.

81
00:08:56,562 --> 00:08:58,183
[SPEAKER_01]: And surprisingly high,

82
00:08:58,653 --> 00:09:02,295
[SPEAKER_01]: He suggested $225,000 for design for all five of those.

83
00:09:02,315 --> 00:09:05,677
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just split them out for each one.

84
00:09:06,157 --> 00:09:13,421
[SPEAKER_01]: We would probably have to split these out over multiple years to do the projects because these are the price tag of the projects.

85
00:09:13,921 --> 00:09:18,264
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all north of $400,000 with the McGlynn being almost double that.

86
00:09:18,564 --> 00:09:20,085
[SPEAKER_01]: So they are big projects to do.

87
00:09:20,985 --> 00:09:26,128
[SPEAKER_01]: Those firearm systems are particularly at the Brooks, the Mississippi and the Roberts

88
00:09:26,864 --> 00:09:29,806
[SPEAKER_01]: at end of life and you're getting hard to find replacement parts for them.

89
00:09:31,848 --> 00:09:33,169
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what's in the capital.

90
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:39,793
[SPEAKER_01]: This column here, I'm not sure if this is titled correctly, this would be the ARP money, the Accelerator Repair Program money.

91
00:09:41,215 --> 00:09:55,505
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll notice that the Brooks only has the schematic design portion because the schematic design would happen pretty far into FY26, so the project would probably be a further year out than this.

92
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,142
[SPEAKER_01]: I did include phase two of the network refresh.

93
00:10:01,822 --> 00:10:03,443
[SPEAKER_01]: This would be our portion.

94
00:10:03,463 --> 00:10:15,470
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a rough estimate right now because we're going through some plans reviews with just from phase one, which is the high school and then the which needs some extra equipment and for the rest of the schools.

95
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:18,472
[SPEAKER_01]: This would be our portion as this would be an E-rate project.

96
00:10:18,892 --> 00:10:21,614
[SPEAKER_01]: So E-rate reimburses us 60% of the project.

97
00:10:21,994 --> 00:10:23,695
[SPEAKER_01]: We only cover 40, which is a wonderful thing.

98
00:10:25,273 --> 00:10:28,495
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I do have intercom upgrades for the Andrews and McGlynn.

99
00:10:28,535 --> 00:10:30,856
[SPEAKER_01]: These are also at end of life and parts are not available.

100
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:33,617
[SPEAKER_01]: We have had some significant issues with Andrews.

101
00:10:34,377 --> 00:10:36,918
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, these are a public safety issue.

102
00:10:37,398 --> 00:10:45,342
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have, um, uh, this is how they announce everything, uh, for, you know, from, you know, fire drills, everything else they talk about on these intercoms.

103
00:10:45,882 --> 00:10:48,043
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, these quotes here are from a vendor.

104
00:10:48,063 --> 00:10:49,364
[SPEAKER_01]: These are rough budget numbers.

105
00:10:49,424 --> 00:10:54,466
[SPEAKER_01]: These will need some refinement if we move these project forward with more design and specification.

106
00:10:54,953 --> 00:10:56,335
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's a pretty good number there.

107
00:10:58,137 --> 00:10:59,479
[SPEAKER_01]: The playground renovation.

108
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:06,668
[SPEAKER_01]: We discussed the need to do a feasibility schematic design for the three playgrounds, having a firm.

109
00:11:07,247 --> 00:11:12,829
[SPEAKER_01]: look at what options we have for different playgrounds, what designs, all that stuff.

110
00:11:13,249 --> 00:11:16,950
[SPEAKER_01]: The TABB provided this estimate here, which seems a lot of money to me.

111
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,511
[SPEAKER_01]: So we may need some more refinement there.

112
00:11:20,811 --> 00:11:27,273
[SPEAKER_01]: This would cover all three designs and give you complete documents to be able to bid those out.

113
00:11:30,154 --> 00:11:31,494
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the first principal items

114
00:11:32,219 --> 00:11:36,262
[SPEAKER_01]: Nick Tucci has 10 cafeteria tables that are in need of a replacement.

115
00:11:36,762 --> 00:11:38,123
[SPEAKER_01]: He has 32 total tables.

116
00:11:38,163 --> 00:11:40,445
[SPEAKER_01]: This would cover 10 of the replacement that he says are immediate.

117
00:11:40,985 --> 00:11:45,168
[SPEAKER_01]: They do probably need to be scheduled out in future years to replace the rest of them.

118
00:11:45,489 --> 00:11:46,809
[SPEAKER_01]: And we should look at some of the other schools.

119
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:49,812
[SPEAKER_01]: But Nick has 10 that he has trouble with right now.

120
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:55,796
[SPEAKER_01]: The next priority I listed was paving.

121
00:11:56,647 --> 00:12:00,008
[SPEAKER_01]: There's quite a bit of paving money listed in the feasibility study.

122
00:12:00,588 --> 00:12:05,709
[SPEAKER_01]: But in order to put this out to bid, we need designs, surveying, all kinds of stuff.

123
00:12:05,969 --> 00:12:08,910
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do need to pay an architect to do all of that work.

124
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:15,572
[SPEAKER_01]: Habib, again, just supplied a rough estimate of what that might cost for those.

125
00:12:16,212 --> 00:12:20,473
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, we may decide to split these up of multiple years, because this is an awful lot of work to be done.

126
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:24,474
[SPEAKER_01]: This is parking lots, driveways, sidewalks, curbs, stuff like that.

127
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:25,674
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of work there.

128
00:12:28,312 --> 00:12:35,776
[SPEAKER_01]: A small item at the McGlynn, the condenser for the fridge and freezer walk-ins units needs to be replaced.

129
00:12:36,176 --> 00:12:40,778
[SPEAKER_01]: It's original to the building, still uses R22 gas, which you can't even get anymore.

130
00:12:42,059 --> 00:12:43,660
[SPEAKER_01]: That should need to be done.

131
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:52,704
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if we have room to include that into the current McGlynn Andrews HVAC project.

132
00:12:53,084 --> 00:12:55,025
[SPEAKER_01]: We did have them quote it out and because

133
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:57,633
[SPEAKER_01]: coding it out through them, through the project, everything else.

134
00:12:57,674 --> 00:13:00,100
[SPEAKER_01]: It's many times more than that to do it through them.

135
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,812
[SPEAKER_01]: We can do it much more efficiently out of the project with a separate contractor.

136
00:13:07,712 --> 00:13:09,472
[SPEAKER_01]: The next section is doors and windows.

137
00:13:10,033 --> 00:13:16,434
[SPEAKER_01]: These are rusted door frames, doors we need replaced, glass bloom, screens, all kinds of stuff like that.

138
00:13:17,134 --> 00:13:19,755
[SPEAKER_01]: These are directly out of the facilities condition assessment report.

139
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:23,856
[SPEAKER_01]: Unlike the fire alarm and the paving, this is a spec we could write ourselves.

140
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:25,756
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a complicated specification to write.

141
00:13:26,396 --> 00:13:28,157
[SPEAKER_01]: And we could put that up.

142
00:13:29,037 --> 00:13:30,477
[SPEAKER_01]: I see Paul has his hand raised.

143
00:13:31,257 --> 00:13:31,477
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

144
00:13:32,198 --> 00:13:32,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Paul.

145
00:13:33,498 --> 00:13:33,618
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi.

146
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:37,832
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody had a bar across their face, so I didn't see anything.

147
00:13:39,432 --> 00:13:49,257
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm assuming, and it's probably impossible to quantify, but those doors and windows, to me, is going to be savings on heating and cooling.

148
00:13:49,277 --> 00:13:50,198
[SPEAKER_00]: Or are they, in fact, not?

149
00:13:55,677 --> 00:13:58,439
[SPEAKER_00]: in a state where we can expect anything like that?

150
00:13:58,459 --> 00:14:03,241
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think, believe you would see a substantial or even detectable change.

151
00:14:03,581 --> 00:14:04,022
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

152
00:14:04,202 --> 00:14:12,586
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the windows these issues are, is there some part of the seal has failed between the multiple panes, and so they're fogged and glassed in there.

153
00:14:13,027 --> 00:14:16,188
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that going to impact some part of the insulation property of the glass?

154
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:19,830
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure, but I don't know that it was something you'd perceive as a change.

155
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:20,411
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

156
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:21,051
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

157
00:14:21,451 --> 00:14:24,593
[SPEAKER_01]: The rusted door frames, things like that, those are becoming mechanical issues.

158
00:14:27,682 --> 00:14:35,865
[SPEAKER_04]: Windows that are in need of the resealing, what happens if we don't do that?

159
00:14:37,265 --> 00:14:39,566
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, the glass has become clouded.

160
00:14:39,586 --> 00:14:40,527
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't see through it.

161
00:14:42,127 --> 00:14:51,331
[SPEAKER_01]: Then eventually, it will become an issue where the gas will fail more and more and it become more and more of an insulation factor of an issue.

162
00:14:51,351 --> 00:14:55,312
[SPEAKER_01]: The windows are not broken, there's screens missing, there's other things like that.

163
00:14:55,894 --> 00:15:00,075
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not about danger.

164
00:15:00,115 --> 00:15:02,735
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about being able to use a window and see through it.

165
00:15:04,396 --> 00:15:05,816
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what the main reason there.

166
00:15:05,836 --> 00:15:14,638
[SPEAKER_01]: So we looked at the Andrews, and if I just filtered out doors and windows, these are the kind of things they're talking about.

167
00:15:16,358 --> 00:15:19,539
[SPEAKER_00]: I am always surprised how much a screen actually costs.

168
00:15:21,779 --> 00:15:24,980
[SPEAKER_00]: I have anyone at home, and I'm like, I don't need one that bad.

169
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:27,851
[SPEAKER_05]: I live in an old school.

170
00:15:28,371 --> 00:15:29,212
[SPEAKER_05]: I see this a lot.

171
00:15:29,232 --> 00:15:31,653
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of what does.

172
00:15:32,113 --> 00:15:40,517
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of these estimates, all of their estimates, they're applying a factor to square footage.

173
00:15:41,038 --> 00:15:47,101
[SPEAKER_01]: So these prices may come down a little bit when we get specific to actual replacements and things like that.

174
00:15:47,141 --> 00:15:49,022
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is how they estimated things.

175
00:15:55,154 --> 00:16:15,712
[SPEAKER_01]: um railings to the karen theater at the high school uh we have not i thought we had we have not received the quote for this yet so this is a guesstimate at this point any number in gray is is a gray number essentially um we're gonna have a real great number for that but this is what i'm estimating at this point uh this would add railings along the left and right going up the staircases for uh patrons to be able to hold on to something as they walk up

176
00:16:17,227 --> 00:16:19,709
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have some damaged seating at the McGlynn.

177
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:30,277
[SPEAKER_01]: This would replace a section of seating with new seating and allow us to use those as parts to continue to repair what's broken and to continue to repair as we go down the road.

178
00:16:32,178 --> 00:16:36,721
[SPEAKER_01]: Nick has requested a flooring and rug replacement at the auditorium and library.

179
00:16:37,042 --> 00:16:38,282
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a rough number from this.

180
00:16:38,342 --> 00:16:39,423
[SPEAKER_01]: I pulled from another school.

181
00:16:39,763 --> 00:16:43,946
[SPEAKER_01]: This needs some more work as far as getting a better number for this, but it's pretty far down the list.

182
00:16:44,607 --> 00:16:45,888
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have the intercom.

183
00:16:46,522 --> 00:16:48,883
[SPEAKER_01]: upgrades at the other three schools.

184
00:16:49,643 --> 00:16:53,845
[SPEAKER_01]: I ranked the Andrews and the McGlynn much higher because they're two years older.

185
00:16:56,467 --> 00:16:58,888
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're in an out year now, but I left them down here.

186
00:16:58,948 --> 00:17:03,690
[SPEAKER_01]: If there was things we traded, moved around, they might enter into the capital report.

187
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:07,992
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of the high level list that we have.

188
00:17:09,621 --> 00:17:20,540
[SPEAKER_01]: We can certainly go through this sheet here, which has the prior year, things in progress, items that were funded and other put in other areas.

189
00:17:21,638 --> 00:17:23,619
[SPEAKER_01]: Some finished projects that were in here.

190
00:17:24,699 --> 00:17:28,720
[SPEAKER_01]: These were the new items section, which I drove the categories for.

191
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,701
[SPEAKER_01]: And then down the bottom is the accelerated repair program totals for each school and categories they fall in.

192
00:17:35,021 --> 00:17:41,683
[SPEAKER_01]: I should have mentioned earlier, the facilities condition assessment report categorizes things in three categories.

193
00:17:41,743 --> 00:17:42,883
[SPEAKER_01]: Priority one is immediate.

194
00:17:42,903 --> 00:17:43,943
[SPEAKER_01]: They're saying we should do now.

195
00:17:44,404 --> 00:17:46,304
[SPEAKER_01]: Priority two is in the two to five years.

196
00:17:46,684 --> 00:17:50,285
[SPEAKER_01]: Priority three is five years or beyond, which I didn't total out here.

197
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:54,207
[SPEAKER_01]: and the bulk of it is in the ARP.

198
00:17:56,789 --> 00:17:59,772
[SPEAKER_04]: Back to the FY27 prioritized list.

199
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:03,535
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, I had a couple of questions.

200
00:18:03,575 --> 00:18:05,316
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure everybody does.

201
00:18:06,177 --> 00:18:16,725
[SPEAKER_04]: One of my questions is about number three, the phase two of the network refresh.

202
00:18:17,086 --> 00:18:18,647
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, this, yep.

203
00:18:19,147 --> 00:18:21,029
[SPEAKER_04]: So this, the 350 is what,

204
00:18:23,172 --> 00:18:25,614
[SPEAKER_04]: remains in order to complete the project.

205
00:18:27,655 --> 00:18:28,115
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?

206
00:18:28,536 --> 00:18:29,096
[SPEAKER_01]: Our portion.

207
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:30,477
[SPEAKER_04]: That's our portion.

208
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:34,960
[SPEAKER_04]: And was that already allocated to us?

209
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,481
[SPEAKER_01]: That I don't know.

210
00:18:36,501 --> 00:18:37,341
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not aware of that.

211
00:18:37,442 --> 00:18:45,047
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that the project was originally like $1.5 million total, and it was too much for E-rate in one year.

212
00:18:45,547 --> 00:18:48,489
[SPEAKER_01]: And Dr. Cushing had split it into two phases.

213
00:18:49,498 --> 00:19:02,186
[SPEAKER_01]: and we've been allocated money in this fiscal year, and we have a little last fiscal year we can use, but I do not know if anything is in a future year, if this money is already allocated out as part of free cash or not, I really do not know.

214
00:19:02,886 --> 00:19:04,568
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if Noel knows, he's on.

215
00:19:07,409 --> 00:19:16,975
[SPEAKER_04]: The allocation was a one-time allocation, but I think I would have to go back to my notes to- Sure.

216
00:19:18,509 --> 00:19:20,511
[SPEAKER_04]: to know, so this is our portion.

217
00:19:20,531 --> 00:19:23,353
[SPEAKER_01]: A phase two that's, yeah.

218
00:19:23,614 --> 00:19:25,275
[SPEAKER_04]: And the rest would be paid for by E-rate?

219
00:19:26,036 --> 00:19:26,336
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.

220
00:19:27,197 --> 00:19:27,437
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

221
00:19:27,817 --> 00:19:29,659
[SPEAKER_01]: That's 40% of the cost of phase two.

222
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:30,760
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

223
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:39,427
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't feel like, maybe we didn't talk about phase two, because I don't remember a number that big, but.

224
00:19:39,808 --> 00:19:44,332
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was one number before, and then late in June, it was split into two phases.

225
00:19:46,474 --> 00:19:48,714
[SPEAKER_01]: Initially it was proposed as one big phase.

226
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:53,535
[SPEAKER_00]: I do remember this.

227
00:19:54,856 --> 00:19:55,376
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

228
00:19:55,616 --> 00:19:55,796
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

229
00:19:56,776 --> 00:19:56,996
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

230
00:19:57,236 --> 00:20:00,437
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't know how that impacted any allocation of money though.

231
00:20:01,657 --> 00:20:02,637
[SPEAKER_00]: That I don't know either.

232
00:20:03,317 --> 00:20:03,617
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

233
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:11,239
[SPEAKER_04]: And my other question was about the playground renovation feasibility piece.

234
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:14,260
[SPEAKER_04]: If you could talk a little bit more about that.

235
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,940
[SPEAKER_04]: I know Teresa's on the call as well.

236
00:20:16,765 --> 00:20:17,026
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

237
00:20:17,809 --> 00:20:21,260
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so, um, we have three more playgrounds to renovate.

238
00:20:21,341 --> 00:20:22,585
[SPEAKER_01]: The Brooks, the Roberts, the Mississippi.

239
00:20:23,163 --> 00:20:36,370
[SPEAKER_01]: need to do kind of a design and feasibility study of what we want to do and how we want to do it and that sort of thing and whether or not, you know, there's alternate locations perhaps with some nearby areas that we could do some other playground work.

240
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:42,113
[SPEAKER_01]: This was the number that Habib just threw out there as a potential cost for that type of a study.

241
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:44,234
[SPEAKER_01]: Seems high to me.

242
00:20:44,254 --> 00:20:45,354
[SPEAKER_01]: I have not had a chance.

243
00:20:45,374 --> 00:20:46,395
[SPEAKER_01]: He just gave it to me today.

244
00:20:46,415 --> 00:20:48,876
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't have a chance to have a conversation with him about it.

245
00:20:49,676 --> 00:20:49,896
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

246
00:20:50,637 --> 00:20:52,338
[SPEAKER_04]: I think our McGlynn study was

247
00:20:54,452 --> 00:20:58,917
[SPEAKER_04]: $50,000, but it was just, it was a design study.

248
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:00,478
[SPEAKER_04]: It was not a feasibility study.

249
00:21:00,518 --> 00:21:02,360
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was different.

250
00:21:02,681 --> 00:21:07,345
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe that's what we need is just a feasibility study and maybe it's 50 per and it's 150.

251
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:14,533
[SPEAKER_01]: This was just a number he put out there just over email quick, you know, trying to get some quick and dirty numbers from when we discussed it this week.

252
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:19,492
[SPEAKER_04]: And I wanted to thank Teresa for joining us as well.

253
00:21:19,552 --> 00:21:33,482
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, Teresa, this came up and we were talking about whether the CPC would fund such a feasibility study across the three remaining schools.

254
00:21:34,463 --> 00:21:40,066
[SPEAKER_04]: And just to get a better understanding of any thoughts that you have that we might want to consider as we think about.

255
00:21:41,027 --> 00:21:44,750
[SPEAKER_04]: potentially putting together a CPC application for this.

256
00:21:45,491 --> 00:21:45,771
[SPEAKER_03]: Certainly.

257
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:47,352
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for having me, Teresa Dupont.

258
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:55,178
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the Community Preservation Act Manager for the city, so I help support the program and the committee that funds these programs, these types of projects.

259
00:21:55,218 --> 00:21:55,339
[SPEAKER_03]: So

260
00:21:56,232 --> 00:22:05,822
[SPEAKER_03]: I also agree that the 350 number is a bit high, especially if this would be all under one contract rather than we do one school, one year, you know, next school, blah, blah, blah.

261
00:22:06,223 --> 00:22:16,353
[SPEAKER_03]: So I feel like that number is probably closer to about 200,000, just based off of past projects and, you know, acceleration and costs that we're seeing across the board.

262
00:22:18,055 --> 00:22:22,457
[SPEAKER_03]: In terms of timing, please forgive me I am I understanding this correctly.

263
00:22:22,497 --> 00:22:27,379
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this for fiscal 27 outlook or things we're trying to accomplish this year.

264
00:22:27,399 --> 00:22:34,443
[SPEAKER_03]: And I asked for grant deadline reasonings on our annual funding round has already passed for fiscal 26 funding.

265
00:22:36,742 --> 00:22:39,463
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this would be for your next funding round.

266
00:22:39,803 --> 00:22:40,403
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, perfect.

267
00:22:40,463 --> 00:22:45,745
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to clarify that because I didn't want to get any hopes dashed if this was something that we were looking to do quickly.

268
00:22:46,925 --> 00:22:48,966
[SPEAKER_03]: But yes, this would be a welcome application for fiscal 27.

269
00:22:49,046 --> 00:22:58,449
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, and I think, you know, 1 of the things 1 of the reasons why we've been talking about this potentially as a feasibility study.

270
00:23:00,382 --> 00:23:23,488
[SPEAKER_04]: The last year, when we did our capital plan, we identified that there are in fact, 3 playground renovations still to go and we identified that the Roberts is our priority, but it is objectively the most complicated project that we'll see because it is the tightest on space and.

271
00:23:24,576 --> 00:23:40,887
[SPEAKER_04]: At the time, last year, the conversation was around, like, we should not be just trying to, like, make a new playground until we address the fundamental space issues at the Roberts in some more, like, fundamental, sustainable way.

272
00:23:41,327 --> 00:23:45,690
[SPEAKER_04]: So at Brooks and Missituk, the situation is a little bit different.

273
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:51,494
[SPEAKER_04]: There is space, and how the space is used certainly could be

274
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:56,369
[SPEAKER_04]: could benefit from modernization, and the equipment is quite old.

275
00:23:57,369 --> 00:23:58,409
[SPEAKER_04]: So all of that is true.

276
00:23:58,449 --> 00:24:04,650
[SPEAKER_04]: But at the Roberts, in addition to all of that being true, they're very space constrained.

277
00:24:06,171 --> 00:24:13,592
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is something that we're going to have to grapple with, which would be part of the feasibility study here.

278
00:24:13,632 --> 00:24:18,133
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, what else can we do to support that school community?

279
00:24:21,415 --> 00:24:24,022
[SPEAKER_04]: and how might we go about thinking about it.

280
00:24:24,142 --> 00:24:27,751
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's part of that feasibility study.

281
00:24:29,692 --> 00:24:43,437
[SPEAKER_03]: I would, I would, I'm sorry, I would highlight that CPA would be eligible for any portion of the feasibility study that would be for outdoor recreation space that serves a public benefit.

282
00:24:43,497 --> 00:24:53,740
[SPEAKER_03]: So if there was some, some thoughts of redesigning the actual interior to accommodate more exterior space, that that element of it wouldn't be eligible, but you know,

283
00:24:55,011 --> 00:24:59,114
[SPEAKER_03]: we would figure that out in the dollar amount calculation.

284
00:24:59,134 --> 00:25:01,416
[SPEAKER_03]: So just wanted to put that out there as a caveat.

285
00:25:02,076 --> 00:25:02,497
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect.

286
00:25:02,977 --> 00:25:05,539
[SPEAKER_04]: And the inside is quite full as well.

287
00:25:05,559 --> 00:25:09,682
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's probably not a lot of opportunity to do anything like that.

288
00:25:09,762 --> 00:25:16,547
[SPEAKER_04]: But you never know how this all shakes out when you get the right people looking at the problem.

289
00:25:16,627 --> 00:25:18,929
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's helpful to know.

290
00:25:21,713 --> 00:25:25,195
[SPEAKER_04]: Paul and Erica, do you have questions about this tab?

291
00:25:25,715 --> 00:25:25,936
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

292
00:25:26,776 --> 00:25:27,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

293
00:25:27,216 --> 00:25:27,897
[SPEAKER_00]: Paul, do you want to?

294
00:25:28,797 --> 00:25:51,271
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually have a question about the definition of outdoor because one of the things as part of the school building project for the high school, Waltham, although they had plenty of land, I'm a little confused why they decided to do this, decided to have their, it's not a playground, it's a field actually on top of

295
00:25:52,692 --> 00:25:55,734
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just an elevated field through which parking is underground.

296
00:25:57,276 --> 00:26:09,565
[SPEAKER_00]: And without eminent domain and taking somebody's house nearby, there's no magical, there's no TARDISes and Time Lords to make us have more room without more room.

297
00:26:10,706 --> 00:26:22,415
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the thoughts that I know that I've been bantering around is, could we put parking under, not underground, just having the playgrounds above parking

298
00:26:23,353 --> 00:26:32,117
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess my question is, what is the definition of outdoor recreation space with if it was elevated above at grade parking?

299
00:26:33,257 --> 00:26:35,078
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that something that hasn't even been considered?

300
00:26:36,979 --> 00:26:43,722
[SPEAKER_03]: In terms of how, you know, we have to be careful under Community Preservation Act law about what is the definition of outdoor.

301
00:26:44,293 --> 00:26:45,153
[SPEAKER_03]: recreation space.

302
00:26:45,273 --> 00:26:52,996
[SPEAKER_03]: Some municipalities, it's kind of, I don't want to say ambiguous, but it does kind of differentiate from municipality to municipality.

303
00:26:53,036 --> 00:26:59,477
[SPEAKER_03]: Some just say it's a blanket, any publicly owned parcel that's under Trapdoor 97 protections.

304
00:27:00,238 --> 00:27:03,419
[SPEAKER_03]: In Medford, our school playgrounds serve as public playgrounds.

305
00:27:03,479 --> 00:27:04,459
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not isolated

306
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:11,004
[SPEAKER_03]: or, you know, exclusive to school use during non-school hours.

307
00:27:11,625 --> 00:27:30,460
[SPEAKER_03]: So in Medford, that type of a project, we wouldn't be able to fund any of the creation of the parking or the surface in which the playground would, well, actually maybe possibly the surface of the playground, if I'm envisioning your scenario correctly.

308
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,061
[SPEAKER_03]: We couldn't create the parking,

309
00:27:32,505 --> 00:27:38,807
[SPEAKER_03]: But we could make it pretty at the end of it with recreation space, recreation use, public amenities on top.

310
00:27:39,387 --> 00:27:40,567
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that answer your question, Paul?

311
00:27:41,007 --> 00:27:41,327
[SPEAKER_00]: It does.

312
00:27:41,508 --> 00:27:48,609
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's very, I mean, other than I think there's a few places that have gone this route because it is, in fact, more expensive.

313
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:53,931
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm sure it's not nearly as expensive as eminent domaining a building.

314
00:27:53,951 --> 00:27:54,131
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

315
00:27:56,292 --> 00:27:56,672
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

316
00:27:57,252 --> 00:27:57,492
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.

317
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:00,703
[SPEAKER_05]: Erica, do you have questions?

318
00:28:01,324 --> 00:28:12,260
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I think most of my questions are going to come up when we start prioritizing and moving things around, because I'm looking at the paving and I'm wondering which of those issues are

319
00:28:13,838 --> 00:28:22,841
[SPEAKER_05]: accessibility issues and which are kind of general wear and tear, but they're not posing an immediate accessibility issue.

320
00:28:22,881 --> 00:28:25,142
[SPEAKER_05]: But I guess that's what the study is going to be addressing.

321
00:28:25,162 --> 00:28:32,605
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Ruseau, actually, I also had the question about parking underneath a playground space.

322
00:28:33,785 --> 00:28:36,526
[SPEAKER_05]: And what was my other piece was

323
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:46,002
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, around the playgrounds and the last, the McGlynn playground was a very community oriented program.

324
00:28:46,962 --> 00:28:54,429
[SPEAKER_05]: And so whether these quotes were around updating what's there or really rethinking the space.

325
00:28:54,609 --> 00:28:59,993
[SPEAKER_05]: And that seems like it could be the definition between that feasibility study and the design study.

326
00:29:00,534 --> 00:29:06,058
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think most of my questions are gonna come up when we start prioritizing, because my big one is around

327
00:29:07,186 --> 00:29:15,268
[SPEAKER_05]: what are these things that maybe they might not be big and urgent, but if we wait, they compound later.

328
00:29:15,768 --> 00:29:18,469
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm ready to keep going, I think.

329
00:29:19,369 --> 00:29:19,609
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

330
00:29:19,649 --> 00:29:25,651
[SPEAKER_01]: To answer your question about the paving, so the McGlynn and the Andrews, they've already addressed the ADA issues.

331
00:29:25,671 --> 00:29:27,412
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I remember that.

332
00:29:27,972 --> 00:29:29,052
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not aware of

333
00:29:29,687 --> 00:29:32,389
[SPEAKER_01]: major issues at the other three elementaries.

334
00:29:32,769 --> 00:29:46,818
[SPEAKER_01]: These are mostly parking lots, curbs, you know, worn out sidewalks, things that are starting to, there are some areas where there's heaving and other things that are causing things, but a lot of it is more in the wear and tear category.

335
00:29:47,779 --> 00:29:52,782
[SPEAKER_04]: And can none of these paving projects include repaving Freedom Way?

336
00:29:53,643 --> 00:29:53,983
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.

337
00:29:54,183 --> 00:29:58,386
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that is now, I just found out yesterday that with Tim McGivern, that that is now a

338
00:29:59,622 --> 00:29:59,722
[SPEAKER_01]: that.

339
00:29:59,803 --> 00:30:05,290
[SPEAKER_01]: City property street and that they have not done any improvements, but they're planning something in the next few years.

340
00:30:07,452 --> 00:30:07,713
[SPEAKER_01]: There's

341
00:30:11,908 --> 00:30:13,129
[SPEAKER_02]: At first, I didn't know if you could hear me.

342
00:30:15,251 --> 00:30:31,762
[SPEAKER_02]: I would, to the paving piece though, say that the Missittuck, we have to wait to see what the study brings, but I would say that the Missittuck has a slight prioritization over the other buildings, especially around the pathway from the staff parking to the school.

343
00:30:32,043 --> 00:30:40,729
[SPEAKER_02]: There's quite a gap that does pose, it's blocked off right now because it does pose a safety issue.

344
00:30:41,449 --> 00:30:56,664
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the front walkway does have some work to do with the Mississippi, so I would say that that has a higher prioritization than the other buildings, but the study will, I think, illuminate that more.

345
00:30:57,145 --> 00:31:04,772
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I also, in addition, because I also had the Roberts pieces that member Rousseau and member Reinfeld

346
00:31:05,573 --> 00:31:18,243
[SPEAKER_02]: have already elevated, but I also have a question around the timeline because the Roberts, unlike the other three buildings, there is no option for outdoor play when this work is happening.

347
00:31:19,533 --> 00:31:23,115
[SPEAKER_02]: So the McGlynn was able to go and use warm out.

348
00:31:23,255 --> 00:31:24,675
[SPEAKER_02]: They were able to work something out.

349
00:31:24,715 --> 00:31:27,237
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also field space in the back.

350
00:31:27,957 --> 00:31:35,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Both the Brooks and the Misituck have adjacent space to go to, and the Roberts does not.

351
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:46,366
[SPEAKER_02]: So I also would have a question around timeline to see if there's a way to have the least amount of impact to

352
00:31:47,785 --> 00:31:48,426
[SPEAKER_02]: student recess.

353
00:31:49,267 --> 00:31:55,133
[SPEAKER_01]: And Missituk may have trouble getting to that outside space, adjacent space, the playground's kind of in between them.

354
00:31:55,153 --> 00:31:56,034
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

355
00:31:57,215 --> 00:32:07,686
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, you know, I think one, you know, one thing that the Missituk and the Brooks have is that you, you could

356
00:32:09,126 --> 00:32:14,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Do 1 and not the other, so you're not like, obliterating both playgrounds at the same time.

357
00:32:14,147 --> 00:32:20,609
[SPEAKER_04]: Although there probably are some real cost trade offs, because I'm sure it's easier for them to come in.

358
00:32:21,209 --> 00:32:26,531
[SPEAKER_04]: Take it all down, put it all back together having said that I don't.

359
00:32:27,753 --> 00:32:45,065
[SPEAKER_04]: The scale, to me, I think what I'll be interested to learn about in the feasibility design process is the scale of what we were able to do at McGlynn was made possible by its space.

360
00:32:45,685 --> 00:32:55,752
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of those pieces of equipment are very large and would consume the whole lower playground at the Brooks.

361
00:32:55,952 --> 00:32:57,233
[SPEAKER_04]: One piece of equipment would

362
00:32:57,942 --> 00:33:00,524
[SPEAKER_04]: sort of be the whole space.

363
00:33:02,625 --> 00:33:23,539
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think the scale of those playgrounds is certainly a question that will be really interesting to ask and answer, and to balance that with the needs of those school communities in general, so that those playgrounds are just as accessible.

364
00:33:25,944 --> 00:33:30,206
[SPEAKER_04]: At the McGlynn, we enjoyed that the space was not the problem, right?

365
00:33:30,266 --> 00:33:34,528
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, there wasn't really a space issue that we had to grapple with.

366
00:33:35,188 --> 00:33:37,709
[SPEAKER_04]: So we were able to do some really interesting things.

367
00:33:38,709 --> 00:33:47,453
[SPEAKER_04]: But my assumption is all of that would become clear during these design processes.

368
00:33:49,174 --> 00:33:54,396
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, Teresa, I think the other question procedurally that I had is,

369
00:33:55,913 --> 00:34:19,410
[SPEAKER_04]: Way back when we just simply did resurfacing of these playgrounds and when actually the McGlynn Design Study came to be the thing that we did first, we were advised that each school had to go in as its own independent request to CPC.

370
00:34:20,211 --> 00:34:23,713
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think what Ken's trying to say here is,

371
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:29,107
[SPEAKER_04]: We would like to do 1 study so there can be some.

372
00:34:29,687 --> 00:34:47,324
[SPEAKER_04]: economy of scale across the three properties instead of having to, like, be in a situation where we are funding, like, kind of one at a time and, like, starting from scratch with potentially a new vendor each time this happens.

373
00:34:47,404 --> 00:34:55,132
[SPEAKER_04]: So could you talk a little bit about whether we would be permitted to do one project that would span all of those buildings?

374
00:34:58,126 --> 00:34:58,486
[SPEAKER_03]: Certainly.

375
00:34:58,506 --> 00:35:10,269
[SPEAKER_03]: I do see that the committee would very likely want to see these come in as separate projects only because they would evaluate each project for the merits of the public benefit that it would serve.

376
00:35:10,589 --> 00:35:21,832
[SPEAKER_03]: So would the MSATUK having, and I'm just spitballing here, and I don't speak for the committee, I can only speak from my experience with them, they would evaluate the MSATUK project and then pit it against

377
00:35:22,652 --> 00:35:49,837
[SPEAKER_03]: the roberts and they would hit the roberts against the right so but you know that's how they would have to evaluate each project um so that's not to say that they wouldn't fund all three in the same funding cycle but they i would foresee them requiring them as separate applications um just because again they would they would have to evaluate it as a standalone project in their eyes um i think that they would obviously understand the

378
00:35:51,137 --> 00:35:57,341
[SPEAKER_03]: the cost savings there would be with lumping them all together, and I believe that that would be factored into their consideration strongly.

379
00:35:57,921 --> 00:36:09,148
[SPEAKER_03]: But I may very well be wrong here, but if that's what the past committee has wanted to see, and me having experience with our current committee, I think that's what they would want to see, unfortunately.

380
00:36:09,168 --> 00:36:12,389
[SPEAKER_04]: Kristina, did you have a question?

381
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:15,111
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope, it got answered.

382
00:36:18,163 --> 00:36:19,949
[SPEAKER_04]: And Teresa, is that an answer?

383
00:36:19,989 --> 00:36:22,456
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, when do we seek that answer?

384
00:36:25,355 --> 00:36:32,716
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, that so that does come through our eligibility determination process, which is basically like a pre pre op.

385
00:36:33,596 --> 00:36:38,057
[SPEAKER_03]: However, you know, this is just something that's being discussed now in a public setting.

386
00:36:38,597 --> 00:36:43,018
[SPEAKER_03]: Certainly, we could bring it to the committee now just to get their gut check.

387
00:36:43,138 --> 00:36:46,579
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's not an actual application, just that this is what we're thinking.

388
00:36:46,619 --> 00:36:47,799
[SPEAKER_03]: How would you respond to this?

389
00:36:48,059 --> 00:36:54,480
[SPEAKER_03]: And that can be, um, you know, considered on our December 9th meeting or early January meeting.

390
00:36:56,694 --> 00:37:10,418
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it might make sense to ask you all to consider that in maybe your January meeting because then we'll have passed this through the school committee in terms of its priorities.

391
00:37:11,139 --> 00:37:22,982
[SPEAKER_04]: I think having that answer would just allow us to do the work to build the documentation that's needed in the right way the first time instead of having to scramble at the end.

392
00:37:23,782 --> 00:37:25,883
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that would probably be very useful.

393
00:37:26,623 --> 00:37:34,644
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I can put together like draft a memo based off of this conversation and kick it to this team for you to review.

394
00:37:36,005 --> 00:37:36,985
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we can go from there.

395
00:37:37,025 --> 00:37:38,185
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy to put that on our agenda.

396
00:37:38,785 --> 00:37:39,625
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, perfect.

397
00:37:40,405 --> 00:37:41,086
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for that.

398
00:37:41,846 --> 00:37:54,228
[SPEAKER_00]: I also think that when that meeting happens, we're gonna do them all.

399
00:37:55,823 --> 00:37:59,124
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the money saving approach.

400
00:37:59,624 --> 00:38:04,166
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, whether we do them one every year, or we can get them all done at once.

401
00:38:04,726 --> 00:38:13,329
[SPEAKER_00]: And I realize what else is on the plate is a big key part of that, or what other potential projects are sitting there.

402
00:38:13,429 --> 00:38:20,372
[SPEAKER_00]: But just thinking about how the money gets spent, I mean, we're going to keep coming back.

403
00:38:21,792 --> 00:38:22,392
[SPEAKER_03]: So hopefully.

404
00:38:25,252 --> 00:38:27,333
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, right.

405
00:38:27,493 --> 00:38:28,153
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

406
00:38:28,834 --> 00:38:29,914
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

407
00:38:35,957 --> 00:38:36,317
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

408
00:38:36,738 --> 00:38:42,801
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Ken, if I am understanding the list correctly, this was your suggested priority.

409
00:38:43,361 --> 00:38:52,705
[SPEAKER_04]: For these projects for the next year, and it totals about 2 and a half million dollars of allocation for the 27.

410
00:38:55,658 --> 00:38:57,619
[SPEAKER_04]: or sooner timeframe, is that right?

411
00:38:57,919 --> 00:38:59,360
[SPEAKER_01]: My initial prioritization, yes.

412
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,880
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

413
00:39:01,321 --> 00:39:05,382
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think Erica raised a question about prioritization.

414
00:39:05,402 --> 00:39:17,448
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess the thing that maybe Erica, if you wanna ask your question and we can figure out whether there are priorities that need to shift here would be the next conversation to have.

415
00:39:17,468 --> 00:39:22,190
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a pre-question on that, which is looking at our fiscal year,

416
00:39:23,884 --> 00:39:28,627
[SPEAKER_05]: 26 capital plan, are we on track or are there things that are getting bumped?

417
00:39:28,687 --> 00:39:44,836
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously the phase two of the network refresh, we know that got split across the two fiscal years, but are we gonna come up to May and go, oh no, we have to adjust the capital plan because how are we doing in our 26 plan?

418
00:39:45,836 --> 00:39:48,558
[SPEAKER_01]: The only one I know of that was a slip was the network.

419
00:39:49,315 --> 00:39:55,417
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I know HVAC got delayed, but we're still in this fiscal year, so great.

420
00:39:56,657 --> 00:40:00,298
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the HVAC project will extend into the summer.

421
00:40:00,318 --> 00:40:01,718
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, that had been planned.

422
00:40:06,579 --> 00:40:17,242
[SPEAKER_01]: We still have a few other smaller items on the capital plan, some of which are in the operations, there's some air conditioning replacements and stuff, we're working on those, but they're small projects I don't anticipate not being accomplished.

423
00:40:18,326 --> 00:40:27,135
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, and then this prioritization list is based on what is most likely to fail or present a clear present danger to folks.

424
00:40:27,915 --> 00:40:31,619
[SPEAKER_01]: As well as the study money getting setting up for the next year.

425
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:31,899
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

426
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:34,802
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so I get the paving couldn't make it.

427
00:40:36,364 --> 00:40:41,927
[SPEAKER_01]: know, we need to do the study for the paving, but if the doors and windows didn't make it, we could do that in the next year without having a study.

428
00:40:42,207 --> 00:40:45,389
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of these bigger projects, you need to do a study and then fund it the next year.

429
00:40:45,409 --> 00:40:47,410
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of like setting up stuff for those.

430
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:47,910
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

431
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:53,413
[SPEAKER_05]: And because we did a chunk of studies this year, and we're now seeing what comes out of that to do that work this year.

432
00:40:53,473 --> 00:40:56,815
[SPEAKER_05]: So that makes a lot of sense.

433
00:40:57,055 --> 00:40:59,956
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm open to, you know, there's a lot here.

434
00:41:00,577 --> 00:41:03,138
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of like, you know, there's some

435
00:41:04,895 --> 00:41:11,780
[SPEAKER_01]: Fire alarm was the most important thing I thought of.

436
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:21,726
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the top level narrative is we need to dig deeper on a number of fronts in FY26.

437
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:26,689
[SPEAKER_04]: so that we can begin doing the work.

438
00:41:27,569 --> 00:41:33,952
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're in a fine enough position right now if we do these studies, because it's going to take time and years to do the work.

439
00:41:35,152 --> 00:41:41,214
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's true of fire alarm and paving and playground renovation.

440
00:41:41,354 --> 00:41:50,437
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's some other things where, in FY26, we should be completing projects like the intercom upgrades and the doors and windows and that kind of thing.

441
00:41:50,457 --> 00:41:51,417
[SPEAKER_01]: 27, you mean? 27.

442
00:41:54,255 --> 00:41:54,476
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

443
00:41:54,496 --> 00:41:55,596
[SPEAKER_01]: 26, I can't do it that quick.

444
00:41:58,258 --> 00:42:05,062
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I guess my other question is, is how squishy are these numbers when we go to other potential vendors, right?

445
00:42:05,102 --> 00:42:09,565
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you kind of got quick and dirty answers from Aviv, who had just done these studies.

446
00:42:09,946 --> 00:42:12,347
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think we're committed to always working with them.

447
00:42:13,128 --> 00:42:18,971
[SPEAKER_05]: So do we anticipate this is going to stay around?

448
00:42:18,991 --> 00:42:21,633
[SPEAKER_01]: These study numbers are rough.

449
00:42:23,107 --> 00:42:26,951
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, just hitting him up really quick and getting some numbers.

450
00:42:26,991 --> 00:42:28,072
[SPEAKER_01]: These may alter a little bit.

451
00:42:28,352 --> 00:42:30,495
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think they're going to change by an order of magnitude.

452
00:42:30,515 --> 00:42:31,115
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

453
00:42:31,356 --> 00:42:42,348
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, and we may also decide that, well, you know, it may not make sense to do all five schools of a study of a fire alarm because we're only gonna be able to fund

454
00:42:43,187 --> 00:42:46,309
[SPEAKER_01]: a couple of them in the fiscal year after that.

455
00:42:46,729 --> 00:42:57,074
[SPEAKER_01]: So it might make sense to move some of the study to the next fiscal year to stagger out what we're doing so that the study doesn't become stale, particularly on fire alarm with this code changes.

456
00:42:58,635 --> 00:43:07,460
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're looking at, this is what Habib suggested, that's $2.6 million of work across five buildings and it's pretty invasive work.

457
00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:10,873
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, you couldn't do all that in 1 summer.

458
00:43:11,374 --> 00:43:13,096
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you, we may decide that.

459
00:43:13,256 --> 00:43:16,780
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, let's do the 2 wallets to the Anderson McGlynn this year.

460
00:43:17,201 --> 00:43:19,303
[SPEAKER_01]: So that we would be scheduling an F. Y.

461
00:43:19,323 --> 00:43:22,007
[SPEAKER_01]: 28 to replace the systems and then F. Y.

462
00:43:22,187 --> 00:43:24,710
[SPEAKER_01]: 28. we studied the 3 elementaries to do those and F. Y. 29.

463
00:43:25,892 --> 00:43:27,352
[SPEAKER_01]: We may schedule that out a little bit.

464
00:43:27,573 --> 00:43:30,233
[SPEAKER_01]: But I was trying to get everything out there that's a possible study.

465
00:43:30,554 --> 00:43:31,314
[SPEAKER_05]: That makes sense.

466
00:43:31,394 --> 00:43:37,416
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we have a sense of which ones are going to be most urgent, or are they all equally urgent in this model?

467
00:43:37,436 --> 00:43:42,577
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I see the study as a way of saying, OK, which are the priorities to make the upgrades?

468
00:43:43,458 --> 00:43:46,319
[SPEAKER_01]: By age, Anders and McGlynn are two years older than the other two.

469
00:43:46,619 --> 00:43:48,299
[SPEAKER_01]: The Roberts system has some problems.

470
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:51,540
[SPEAKER_01]: We're able to work out.

471
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:53,521
[SPEAKER_05]: Just what I want to hear with the kid at the Roberts.

472
00:43:54,697 --> 00:43:58,001
[SPEAKER_01]: There are things we need to work on, but they're not critical things.

473
00:43:58,081 --> 00:44:01,524
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're noticing that we're having trouble finding parts for that system.

474
00:44:02,305 --> 00:44:04,367
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a similar system to the other two elementaries.

475
00:44:04,447 --> 00:44:11,315
[SPEAKER_01]: So by age, Andrews and McGlynn are older, but I haven't had the issues there.

476
00:44:12,956 --> 00:44:14,138
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're different systems.

477
00:44:14,835 --> 00:44:26,918
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, because the other thing that I would love to be aware of big picture here is if we're studying things and we're that we're doing work in lots of different places so that it's not oh well the McGlynn is getting.

478
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:28,740
[SPEAKER_05]: all the love and care.

479
00:44:29,641 --> 00:44:37,644
[SPEAKER_05]: So to be able to stagger things in that way, I think is a good faith gesture to the community, obviously driven by urgent need, but.

480
00:44:38,044 --> 00:44:41,666
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also the ability to get multiple projects at one building down to the same place.

481
00:44:41,746 --> 00:44:42,186
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.

482
00:44:42,206 --> 00:44:47,008
[SPEAKER_01]: You can only fit so many, as we learned with the HVAC, you can only get so many guys working at a time, you know, so.

483
00:44:47,028 --> 00:44:49,269
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

484
00:44:54,232 --> 00:44:55,333
[SPEAKER_05]: And can you scroll down again?

485
00:44:55,353 --> 00:44:58,315
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to remind myself what's at the bottom intercom tourism.

486
00:44:58,375 --> 00:44:58,655
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

487
00:44:59,435 --> 00:44:59,796
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

488
00:45:00,856 --> 00:45:03,758
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, I think the other question I had about.

489
00:45:04,979 --> 00:45:07,881
[SPEAKER_04]: Paving was these prices.

490
00:45:09,142 --> 00:45:15,006
[SPEAKER_04]: Assume that we're going to contract out to do this paving work, right?

491
00:45:15,026 --> 00:45:15,646
[SPEAKER_06]: Correct.

492
00:45:16,407 --> 00:45:16,647
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

493
00:45:17,487 --> 00:45:21,310
[SPEAKER_04]: And has there been any conversation with about their.

494
00:45:23,850 --> 00:45:29,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Ability to take this stuff on instead, or no, not yet.

495
00:45:29,572 --> 00:45:30,673
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no discussion.

496
00:45:31,613 --> 00:45:32,874
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

497
00:45:33,534 --> 00:45:39,957
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that they have their own backlog and I'm quite certain it's enormous and it does not include.

498
00:45:44,098 --> 00:45:50,761
[SPEAKER_04]: Schools, so that may be a non starter, but.

499
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:53,891
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you referring to streets or for municipal buildings?

500
00:45:55,012 --> 00:45:58,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they, they have a backlog for roads and sidewalks.

501
00:45:58,454 --> 00:46:01,455
[SPEAKER_04]: That is like 200 and something million dollars.

502
00:46:02,036 --> 00:46:04,757
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of that is probably farmed out to contractors.

503
00:46:05,537 --> 00:46:05,918
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

504
00:46:06,358 --> 00:46:09,620
[SPEAKER_04]: However, we did just like fund a crew.

505
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:10,280
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

506
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:15,803
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that poor crew, like there's a lot of expectations about what that crew can reasonably do.

507
00:46:17,227 --> 00:46:23,190
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, at any given time, but I just didn't know if there had been any conversations about, you know.

508
00:46:23,230 --> 00:46:36,376
[SPEAKER_01]: But I can certainly have that conversation with Tim McGiven, as well as, you know, let's just say, you know, we asked them to do the Brooks, you know, parking lots and stuff, given the size of their crew, how quickly could they do that in a summer?

509
00:46:37,476 --> 00:46:44,579
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, because it's also, you know, maybe a lot, farming it out may allow us to get it done and not impact the school as much, but that comes at a cost, of course.

510
00:46:44,919 --> 00:46:46,320
[SPEAKER_01]: But I can certainly have that conversation with them.

511
00:46:47,368 --> 00:46:51,009
[SPEAKER_04]: And it would just maybe be helpful to understand where that fits.

512
00:46:52,569 --> 00:47:00,411
[SPEAKER_00]: I also wonder, though, if using the city would allow us to avoid procurement and bidding and all that other nonsense.

513
00:47:00,431 --> 00:47:01,572
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to say nonsense.

514
00:47:01,592 --> 00:47:02,152
[SPEAKER_00]: I said nonsense.

515
00:47:02,212 --> 00:47:04,432
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, all those other steps that.

516
00:47:04,772 --> 00:47:05,153
[SPEAKER_00]: Hurdles.

517
00:47:05,673 --> 00:47:06,533
[SPEAKER_00]: Hurdles, thank you.

518
00:47:08,233 --> 00:47:10,594
[SPEAKER_00]: Although, I mean, I don't know.

519
00:47:10,614 --> 00:47:14,415
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd have to procure the materials.

520
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:20,862
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's far easier than service, you know, construction.

521
00:47:21,322 --> 00:47:28,164
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sure they probably have state contracts they can leverage for asphalt and granite and other materials that they purchase, so.

522
00:47:33,786 --> 00:47:39,608
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so the money question, although Member Graham, you look like you're about to say something.

523
00:47:40,469 --> 00:47:43,050
[SPEAKER_04]: My only other question was whether

524
00:47:44,957 --> 00:47:50,459
[SPEAKER_04]: The Karen theater railing deserved a slightly higher billing than that.

525
00:47:50,719 --> 00:47:51,499
[SPEAKER_04]: And I, I just.

526
00:47:55,041 --> 00:47:58,122
[SPEAKER_01]: It may be something you can put into the extraordinary repairs account.

527
00:47:58,762 --> 00:47:59,002
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

528
00:47:59,742 --> 00:48:10,166
[SPEAKER_01]: There's, you know, if I look back at the, um, the operating money, this was all in what I, I'm sorry, wrong one operating here.

529
00:48:10,910 --> 00:48:15,231
[SPEAKER_01]: I categorize $247,000 worth of work as operating work.

530
00:48:16,112 --> 00:48:22,134
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's like probably two years worth of the extraordinary repairs plus other things that come in.

531
00:48:22,194 --> 00:48:36,578
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's possible we could look through this and prioritize the work that's in here, slide some of the smaller items into the operating budget, like the railings, like the condenser replacement if it doesn't go, some of those things could squeeze into there.

532
00:48:37,441 --> 00:48:41,263
[SPEAKER_04]: more easily to stretch out that two year timeframe to three potentially.

533
00:48:41,283 --> 00:48:41,463
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

534
00:48:41,923 --> 00:48:42,644
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, got it.

535
00:48:43,444 --> 00:48:44,244
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's helpful.

536
00:48:44,765 --> 00:48:52,288
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that was going to be my question about what could get wrapped into the operating and the point I think, to the point of the current theater.

537
00:48:54,069 --> 00:48:54,990
[SPEAKER_05]: We're looking at.

538
00:48:56,111 --> 00:48:58,433
[SPEAKER_05]: a new high school in the not-too-distant future.

539
00:48:59,034 --> 00:49:07,281
[SPEAKER_05]: And so if this is a repair that needs to happen, it really doesn't make sense to put it off and only have this happen for one year.

540
00:49:07,301 --> 00:49:09,103
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's not a repair.

541
00:49:09,143 --> 00:49:11,225
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like it's do it soon or don't do it at all.

542
00:49:11,405 --> 00:49:12,066
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

543
00:49:12,086 --> 00:49:15,028
[SPEAKER_01]: The railings itself are, they don't exist now.

544
00:49:15,529 --> 00:49:15,809
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

545
00:49:16,530 --> 00:49:17,270
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a repair.

546
00:49:17,931 --> 00:49:18,812
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, yes.

547
00:49:19,012 --> 00:49:19,853
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that space.

548
00:49:23,155 --> 00:49:35,606
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, and I think to that point, Ken, maybe the question is whether there's an opportunity to do that in the FY26 Extraordinary Repair Bucket.

549
00:49:37,267 --> 00:49:39,749
[SPEAKER_01]: Potentially, there's a lot of other stuff that's in there too though.

550
00:49:39,989 --> 00:49:41,611
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting quotes and things on that.

551
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:44,753
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still waiting to quote for this railing.

552
00:49:45,614 --> 00:49:46,855
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to get the company to give us that.

553
00:49:46,955 --> 00:49:47,656
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been difficult.

554
00:49:50,345 --> 00:49:56,651
[SPEAKER_04]: So that would be the other sort of maybe variable to think about before we move it out.

555
00:49:56,911 --> 00:49:58,913
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

556
00:50:04,718 --> 00:50:08,602
[SPEAKER_04]: Paul and Erica, what other questions do you have about prioritization?

557
00:50:12,586 --> 00:50:14,587
[SPEAKER_00]: Not prioritization, but I see that,

558
00:50:15,853 --> 00:50:26,817
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Tucci has put in things here that I feel like, why would that not be a thing that all the schools should probably need at the same time?

559
00:50:27,117 --> 00:50:30,678
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not suggesting, if they didn't ask, that we should just do it.

560
00:50:30,798 --> 00:50:35,360
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm just sensitive.

561
00:50:36,413 --> 00:50:43,876
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the other school committee members are just sensitive to, you know, one school getting things and other schools needing them but not getting them.

562
00:50:44,176 --> 00:50:51,878
[SPEAKER_00]: And the conversation after the fact, well, they never asked, doesn't really hold a lot of water with the people who will be complaining.

563
00:50:53,079 --> 00:51:04,403
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just think that, you know, I mean, I feel like as long as I've had kids in the schools, the complaints that the rugs are

564
00:51:05,211 --> 00:51:13,114
[SPEAKER_00]: ancient and dirty, and there's lots of issues there, but... How many donors choose projects either for rugs?

565
00:51:13,574 --> 00:51:14,094
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.

566
00:51:15,074 --> 00:51:32,340
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, this is like one more thing for Ken to put on his very long to-do list, but there are certain items that, I mean, a rug in an elementary school in a kindergarten has a lifespan, and we shouldn't wait for complaints.

567
00:51:33,430 --> 00:51:38,951
[SPEAKER_00]: to decide it's that time to just put them on a schedule.

568
00:51:39,431 --> 00:51:42,912
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have no clue how long it actually is.

569
00:51:44,533 --> 00:51:52,535
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also worry about people buying rugs through DonorsChoose because fire code stuff, we can't just have anything in a class.

570
00:51:53,875 --> 00:52:01,957
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, if we're not buying it, I don't think it's fair to say, no, no, you've got to buy only these allowed kinds.

571
00:52:02,641 --> 00:52:06,063
[SPEAKER_00]: to people who are doing a donor's choose to get a new rug.

572
00:52:06,824 --> 00:52:12,628
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like we're talking about a rug, even though we're talking about many millions of dollars here, but they're expensive.

573
00:52:14,689 --> 00:52:17,631
[SPEAKER_00]: The ones that meet fire codes for schools and all that stuff, so.

574
00:52:18,342 --> 00:52:31,353
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's actually maybe a bigger conversation for the next term, which is we have lots of entities that buy things on behalf of classrooms and schools, right?

575
00:52:31,433 --> 00:52:33,755
[SPEAKER_04]: Like our PTOs are very active in that way.

576
00:52:34,616 --> 00:52:44,864
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of like my huge frustrations from my time on the PTO before I was elected to the school committee is,

577
00:52:46,043 --> 00:52:51,668
[SPEAKER_04]: we would purchase things and turn them over and then they would not be maintained, right?

578
00:52:52,408 --> 00:53:00,214
[SPEAKER_04]: Or we would turn them over and then they would, with some like handshake agreement that never was fulfilled.

579
00:53:00,335 --> 00:53:04,738
[SPEAKER_04]: Like there was a year where we bought a new rug for every classroom teacher.

580
00:53:05,559 --> 00:53:10,262
[SPEAKER_04]: And the ask was, can they just be cleaned every year in the summer?

581
00:53:10,463 --> 00:53:12,164
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they never got cleaned.

582
00:53:14,302 --> 00:53:16,326
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think there's like a bigger quest.

583
00:53:16,366 --> 00:53:19,031
[SPEAKER_04]: There's like something a little bit broader there about

584
00:53:20,249 --> 00:53:27,495
[SPEAKER_04]: how to collaborate with people who are trying to help us in a full circle kind of way, right?

585
00:53:27,555 --> 00:53:33,719
[SPEAKER_04]: Because nobody wants to buy things for us that we shouldn't have, right?

586
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:35,201
[SPEAKER_04]: But people don't know.

587
00:53:35,221 --> 00:53:49,412
[SPEAKER_04]: And so how do we create an easy pathway for that to happen and to understand what is coming into the universe of essentially our expectation of maintenance?

588
00:53:50,411 --> 00:53:54,733
[SPEAKER_04]: that we need to know about, because I don't think we have a good line of sight of what those things are.

589
00:53:55,313 --> 00:54:02,196
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's just all kinds of questions about, well, like, I don't know where that came from, or I don't know who's supposed to do that thing.

590
00:54:02,976 --> 00:54:11,020
[SPEAKER_04]: And we could, like, sort of tighten up all of that process a little bit for sure upcoming.

591
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:20,024
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing to keep in mind about the McGlynn is the seating and the rug replacement has a direct correlation to the amount of outside rentals we have in there.

592
00:54:20,594 --> 00:54:27,158
[SPEAKER_01]: you have a massive rental in there every single weekend that's adding a ton more wear and tear to that building than any other building.

593
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:37,145
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's maybe looking at our, again, looking at rental rates in community schools.

594
00:54:37,265 --> 00:54:40,287
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's a Rob question as well.

595
00:54:41,027 --> 00:54:43,088
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think that's fair.

596
00:54:43,128 --> 00:54:47,992
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know some of the rental groups have contributed to the lighting system at the McGlynn.

597
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:57,929
[SPEAKER_05]: we're looking at a donation for the audio system from a group of caregivers, but yeah.

598
00:54:58,049 --> 00:55:18,134
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that is like another thing for us to consider talking about in the next term in terms of like what, you know, what are people paying for rentals and how are we like, how are we managing all of that in a consistent way?

599
00:55:18,514 --> 00:55:19,674
[SPEAKER_04]: And does it cover,

600
00:55:20,456 --> 00:55:27,783
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one thing to cover the cost of the maintenance and the custodial who are on site when they're there.

601
00:55:27,843 --> 00:55:38,153
[SPEAKER_04]: That's one cost, but then there's what it costs to heat and power the building, and then there's yet another cost about wear and tear.

602
00:55:38,793 --> 00:55:44,358
[SPEAKER_04]: All of these things happen faster when we have heavy rental use.

603
00:55:44,739 --> 00:55:45,960
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not suggesting we shouldn't

604
00:55:47,290 --> 00:55:50,412
[SPEAKER_04]: want our schools to be used in this way because I think it's great.

605
00:55:51,613 --> 00:55:57,457
[SPEAKER_04]: It just has to not disadvantage the mission of the schools at the same time, right?

606
00:55:57,537 --> 00:56:02,120
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a big conversation to have there as well.

607
00:56:04,142 --> 00:56:07,064
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually very excited to have that conversation.

608
00:56:08,087 --> 00:56:08,547
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you?

609
00:56:11,069 --> 00:56:32,179
[SPEAKER_02]: I am just because I think we do appreciate a lot of the partnerships and definitely schools are community spaces, but I do think we need some clarity added to the use of our schools and down to the how and the when and the how much and the why.

610
00:56:33,465 --> 00:56:39,369
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely needs to be a conversation so that we're adding more clarity to that.

611
00:56:39,569 --> 00:56:45,633
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the McGlynn has seen a lot of wear and tear.

612
00:56:45,673 --> 00:56:56,619
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's also protective coating that is on the stage pretty much 24-7 to protect the wood of the stage.

613
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:02,363
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think just that overall conversation definitely needs to be had.

614
00:57:07,994 --> 00:57:09,995
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

615
00:57:10,596 --> 00:57:12,297
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that building and ground subcommittee?

616
00:57:12,377 --> 00:57:15,299
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that a separate, is that an offline conversation?

617
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:17,961
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that this group?

618
00:57:18,001 --> 00:57:19,162
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure it's this group.

619
00:57:20,683 --> 00:57:28,348
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I don't know what group it is actually, but I also think the groups are subject to change.

620
00:57:28,968 --> 00:57:29,209
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

621
00:57:29,389 --> 00:57:31,890
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just thinking about what we're organizing for.

622
00:57:32,611 --> 00:57:32,931
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

623
00:57:33,491 --> 00:57:33,612
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

624
00:57:33,632 --> 00:57:35,573
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we should have that conversation to figure out who,

625
00:57:36,344 --> 00:57:39,926
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, how the upcoming committee wants to organize.

626
00:57:39,986 --> 00:57:48,171
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, because there's an argument for splitting strategic and capital planning into two, given the strategic planning process that's about to come online.

627
00:57:48,711 --> 00:57:49,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

628
00:57:49,912 --> 00:57:52,294
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, that's a separate conversation, not on the agenda.

629
00:57:52,374 --> 00:57:55,816
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess we're back to the priorities here.

630
00:57:56,616 --> 00:57:59,138
[SPEAKER_05]: Are there any other questions or objections?

631
00:58:00,971 --> 00:58:15,327
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I think just to identify which of these, right, if we're looking at staggering some of these studies to highlight which ones come first and then if there's another study that needs to happen.

632
00:58:16,993 --> 00:58:32,347
[SPEAKER_05]: maybe that doesn't have that time urgency constraint, then the schools that aren't getting the urgent ones get the other study and flip-flop in subsequent fiscal years, right?

633
00:58:39,810 --> 00:58:44,572
[SPEAKER_04]: So, are there other like, so I think there's some numbers that we're still trying to refine.

634
00:58:44,752 --> 00:58:45,193
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think.

635
00:58:45,993 --> 00:58:49,895
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm thinking December 15th is still the right date for us to bring this forward.

636
00:58:50,795 --> 00:58:56,798
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but not sure if there's anything else that you all are thinking about that we need to talk about before.

637
00:58:57,358 --> 00:59:01,560
[SPEAKER_04]: We feel like we're ready to bring this forward to the committee.

638
00:59:02,625 --> 00:59:13,392
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and or if we need to try to shoehorn another meeting in to have more discussion, so I don't know how you all are feeling about where we're at.

639
00:59:13,412 --> 00:59:16,513
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, last year we had 2 meetings in the 2nd, 1.

640
00:59:17,614 --> 00:59:19,775
[SPEAKER_05]: before we presented to the whole committee.

641
00:59:20,075 --> 00:59:25,457
[SPEAKER_05]: And the second one was about projecting out, saying these are the things we've chosen for this year.

642
00:59:25,617 --> 00:59:30,899
[SPEAKER_05]: And in context, here's what's coming and why we've prioritized these.

643
00:59:30,959 --> 00:59:32,900
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that needs to happen.

644
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:39,222
[SPEAKER_05]: I do think it would be good for this group to be on the same page in presenting that.

645
00:59:41,163 --> 00:59:43,104
[SPEAKER_05]: But I am also aware that December 15th is

646
00:59:44,884 --> 00:59:49,305
[SPEAKER_05]: less than a month away, and we've got Thanksgiving and all sorts of other things.

647
00:59:52,026 --> 01:00:02,109
[SPEAKER_05]: We do have this committee to meet to, I think, discuss intra-district policies.

648
01:00:03,550 --> 01:00:04,290
[SPEAKER_04]: On December 8.

649
01:00:05,410 --> 01:00:10,512
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm sort of wondering if, like,

650
01:00:11,637 --> 01:00:34,323
[SPEAKER_04]: we use that time to have a second conversation about this and we move the inter-district into January and figure out like where it's proper home is as potentially the subcommittees change because I don't really foresee that we could pull off an inter-district policy in December 2025 at this point.

651
01:00:34,643 --> 01:00:36,623
[SPEAKER_04]: So do we want to?

652
01:00:36,643 --> 01:00:38,884
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean the only the reason that was being loud.

653
01:00:44,413 --> 01:00:45,613
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, sorry, Erica, what were you saying?

654
01:00:45,694 --> 01:00:46,414
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no.

655
01:00:46,594 --> 01:00:47,394
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you hear the siren?

656
01:00:47,434 --> 01:00:48,575
[SPEAKER_05]: I muted because- No.

657
01:00:48,935 --> 01:00:49,255
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

658
01:00:49,275 --> 01:00:51,996
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a roaring siren heading down the street.

659
01:00:53,436 --> 01:01:08,342
[SPEAKER_05]: As I recall, we scheduled the intra-district enrollment policy in order to beat the kindergarten registration so that we had that information in place as soon as people started asking questions about why are they registered for a school that's not in their backyard?

660
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:11,823
[SPEAKER_05]: Am I right about that, Dr. Galusi?

661
01:01:11,863 --> 01:01:13,024
[SPEAKER_05]: That was our motivation?

662
01:01:16,713 --> 01:01:18,974
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there were a couple pieces of motivation.

663
01:01:19,014 --> 01:01:31,379
[SPEAKER_02]: I think some of this did come out from the enrollment in overcrowding subcommittee report that I gave in May, because some of the inter-district transfers were around

664
01:01:32,559 --> 01:01:41,804
[SPEAKER_02]: at least that I was a part of when I gave that presentation, was around because we were not able to have full capacity of afterschool care.

665
01:01:42,224 --> 01:01:47,066
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of the inter-district transfers were childcare related for afterschool.

666
01:01:47,587 --> 01:01:57,952
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there was the piece around inter-district transfers for keeping families together, for specialized sub-separate programming.

667
01:02:00,059 --> 01:02:06,283
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, but was kindergarten registration, was that our deadline or did I just hallucinate that?

668
01:02:07,303 --> 01:02:08,704
[SPEAKER_05]: Was that a deadline?

669
01:02:08,764 --> 01:02:10,305
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't sound like- We may not have.

670
01:02:10,485 --> 01:02:12,566
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember that hard deadline.

671
01:02:12,606 --> 01:02:14,988
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I don't remember kindergarten registration either.

672
01:02:15,008 --> 01:02:26,634
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, certainly before we start, you know, those inter-district conversations tend to happen closer to the end of the school year, so then we have a little bit of time.

673
01:02:29,030 --> 01:02:30,991
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not thinking of anything that has to happen.

674
01:02:31,011 --> 01:02:35,052
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I think it was just kindergarten registration, but I think there is a window there.

675
01:02:35,952 --> 01:02:42,595
[SPEAKER_05]: If that's not urgent, then I'm fine to use the December 8th meeting for this since it's on the calendar.

676
01:02:42,615 --> 01:02:43,475
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

677
01:02:44,896 --> 01:02:45,276
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect.

678
01:02:45,816 --> 01:02:50,438
[SPEAKER_04]: My calendar is really miserable, so I'm glad to not have to find another hour.

679
01:02:52,981 --> 01:03:14,374
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just ask that we, when we're ready for the presentation at school committee, that we give a 90 second primer on what does it mean to be net school spending eligible and all this other stuff, because if anything, it's important, but it's also not exactly intuitive.

680
01:03:14,454 --> 01:03:18,917
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a note for the presentation when we do get to it.

681
01:03:20,908 --> 01:03:35,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so I am thinking in terms of next steps, Ken and I can work on forming this into maybe two things.

682
01:03:35,953 --> 01:03:40,475
[SPEAKER_04]: One is, here's what was previously funded in a status.

683
01:03:42,096 --> 01:03:47,237
[SPEAKER_04]: Second is, here's the recommendation and how it lays out for FY27 forward.

684
01:03:51,099 --> 01:04:02,328
[SPEAKER_04]: And then maybe there's like another part of like describing like one, maybe if we do it one time, we don't have to do it every year.

685
01:04:02,368 --> 01:04:04,950
[SPEAKER_04]: Like those, those things exactly remember.

686
01:04:05,150 --> 01:04:17,640
[SPEAKER_04]: So like, here's our, like, as a reminder, here's our like little visual process and here's what these things mean so that if we can get that right one time, it's going to work for all the times, right?

687
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:19,121
[SPEAKER_04]: That people have these questions.

688
01:04:19,947 --> 01:04:23,248
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm wondering if those are maybe the 2 things that need to happen.

689
01:04:23,268 --> 01:04:33,353
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, before the 8th, I don't know if anyone wants to volunteer for number 2.

690
01:04:35,054 --> 01:04:41,076
[SPEAKER_04]: What was number 2, like, outlining, like, what is what is our capital planning process?

691
01:04:41,136 --> 01:04:44,478
[SPEAKER_04]: And what are these, like, important terms and definitions just so that.

692
01:04:46,245 --> 01:04:52,469
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, is it the process and these are the buckets where things come from and why they can go in one bucket and not in another?

693
01:04:52,489 --> 01:04:53,250
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

694
01:04:57,652 --> 01:04:58,773
[SPEAKER_00]: Just looking at the policy.

695
01:05:00,194 --> 01:05:04,517
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember Jerry gave, Mr. McHugh gave us a lovely briefer on that.

696
01:05:05,157 --> 01:05:05,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

697
01:05:05,478 --> 01:05:14,704
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm just thinking like, if we write it down in a something visual one time, it will be better than if we talk about it 10 times.

698
01:05:16,123 --> 01:05:21,970
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that I can handle that with Will and the finance office.

699
01:05:25,254 --> 01:05:26,215
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the policy.

700
01:05:27,277 --> 01:05:32,563
[SPEAKER_00]: We did not update it, but there is one date, I believe, or maybe a couple of dates that are not.

701
01:05:34,285 --> 01:05:35,387
[SPEAKER_00]: When we did this last year,

702
01:05:36,395 --> 01:05:41,859
[SPEAKER_00]: there was a date or two that were sort of not possible or feasible or whatever the words were.

703
01:05:42,879 --> 01:05:52,866
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep that in mind when you look at the dates in the actual policy that you might not wanna freak out about how, wait, we can't do that, can't meet that date.

704
01:05:53,727 --> 01:06:05,335
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was getting the target date we have is February 28th and- For the budget, not for capital, right?

705
01:06:06,778 --> 01:06:10,060
[SPEAKER_00]: No, this is the capital improvement planning policy.

706
01:06:12,182 --> 01:06:17,445
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I think last year we ended up way ahead of the schedule because.

707
01:06:18,505 --> 01:06:26,210
[SPEAKER_04]: We, I think the policy says, have a committee of the whole and then have a vote and we did that all in 1 meeting.

708
01:06:26,230 --> 01:06:31,914
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and so we were done in December last year when I think we weren't scheduled to be done until before that.

709
01:06:33,489 --> 01:06:36,774
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the budget calendar definitely shifted because of override.

710
01:06:36,834 --> 01:06:36,934
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

711
01:06:37,635 --> 01:06:37,955
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

712
01:06:37,995 --> 01:06:38,296
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.

713
01:06:38,336 --> 01:06:39,437
[SPEAKER_00]: The budget was the thing that moved.

714
01:06:39,457 --> 01:06:46,186
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it was, there was a sudden infusion of funds that we maybe didn't want to rush through allocating.

715
01:06:47,568 --> 01:06:47,809
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.

716
01:06:47,869 --> 01:06:48,269
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

717
01:06:49,891 --> 01:06:50,953
[SPEAKER_00]: So do look at the policy then.

718
01:06:53,159 --> 01:07:00,001
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, I think we actually, I think we beat the, I think we beat the clock on this one.

719
01:07:00,961 --> 01:07:01,241
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

720
01:07:01,621 --> 01:07:13,084
[SPEAKER_04]: So Ken, I'll connect with you and we can like ship this out and then put that visual together and then we should be in good shape.

721
01:07:13,224 --> 01:07:22,046
[SPEAKER_04]: And I am thinking we can probably do this in one meeting again, instead of trying to have a committee of the whole and then a meeting to take the vote.

722
01:07:22,426 --> 01:07:22,546
Yeah.

723
01:07:22,857 --> 01:07:31,941
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we won't have Teresa, the CPA's best guess at how they would treat these applications by then.

724
01:07:31,961 --> 01:07:34,182
[SPEAKER_05]: You can put that just in the comments.

725
01:07:34,643 --> 01:07:35,283
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is fine.

726
01:07:35,343 --> 01:07:40,085
[SPEAKER_05]: I just, I think that's, if that's the one piece we're missing, we're in good shape.

727
01:07:42,086 --> 01:07:42,286
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

728
01:07:43,247 --> 01:07:44,127
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I may.

729
01:07:45,918 --> 01:07:52,701
[SPEAKER_03]: I can have an administrative conversation with our chairperson to see what her gut is to if that is at all helpful.

730
01:07:53,642 --> 01:07:56,803
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it would need, it would still need to go before our committee for a vote on.

731
01:07:57,780 --> 01:08:12,143
[SPEAKER_05]: an official stance of how they would accept the application, but if that's at all helpful, I can get a... It is for mapping purposes and it can get tweaked if the official vote doesn't match, but I think two gut checks is a great start.

732
01:08:12,163 --> 01:08:12,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, perfect.

733
01:08:12,504 --> 01:08:17,405
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, I'll get that from her and send along an official memo from us and from me and the chairperson.

734
01:08:17,945 --> 01:08:18,485
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

735
01:08:25,147 --> 01:08:26,627
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other questions or comments?

736
01:08:31,668 --> 01:08:37,213
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to comment on how much I appreciate the administration's work on this.

737
01:08:37,733 --> 01:08:48,042
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just remembering when I joined the school committee and the differences between now and then are beyond stark.

738
01:08:49,832 --> 01:08:53,773
[SPEAKER_00]: in what we are, in what we understand about the state of things.

739
01:08:54,873 --> 01:09:02,896
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, knowing isn't, I don't know, is half the battle, but knowing is certainly required to even go to battle on these numbers.

740
01:09:04,036 --> 01:09:11,398
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm beyond thankful and very excited to find this money.

741
01:09:12,714 --> 01:09:16,675
[SPEAKER_05]: And extra thanks to Ken for diving in and jumping on this.

742
01:09:17,536 --> 01:09:21,357
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a delight of a view of what we're doing.

743
01:09:22,137 --> 01:09:22,578
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.

744
01:09:22,938 --> 01:09:23,318
[SPEAKER_06]: You're welcome.

745
01:09:23,338 --> 01:09:26,459
[SPEAKER_02]: Bedford Public Schools is very lucky to have Ken Lord.

746
01:09:26,479 --> 01:09:28,620
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

747
01:09:32,761 --> 01:09:33,121
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

748
01:09:33,141 --> 01:09:34,482
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's it.

749
01:09:34,602 --> 01:09:34,922
[SPEAKER_04]: It's only 511.

750
01:09:35,062 --> 01:09:35,162
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

751
01:09:35,442 --> 01:09:40,404
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a little time before my next meeting.

752
01:09:45,055 --> 01:09:46,478
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a motion to adjourn?

753
01:09:46,498 --> 01:09:47,881
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll motion to adjourn.

754
01:09:48,502 --> 01:09:49,745
