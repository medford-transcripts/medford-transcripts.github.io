1
00:38:21,578 --> 00:38:28,259
Can I just add, we have two other students here tonight that actually were the masterminds behind the video, Abigail Brady and Kayla Velmay.

2
00:38:28,779 --> 00:38:29,519
Okay.

3
00:38:43,482 --> 00:38:46,423
Thanks for helping Christina do her amazing project.

4
00:38:47,483 --> 00:38:47,943
Nice job.

5
00:38:55,615 --> 00:38:56,095
Also, Ms.

6
00:38:56,316 --> 00:38:59,659
Vandekluw, while we're under suspension, did you want to speak on this a lot?

7
00:39:03,242 --> 00:39:05,344
That was part of the... Who made the puppet, Christina?

8
00:39:06,506 --> 00:39:07,887
That was part of the program.

9
00:39:08,628 --> 00:39:09,609
Did you guys make that?

10
00:39:09,629 --> 00:39:11,991
We had it in the program.

11
00:39:13,172 --> 00:39:13,452
Okay.

12
00:39:13,653 --> 00:39:15,234
I also want to comment on...

13
00:39:16,574 --> 00:39:21,677
These are fairly new programs within the method public schools and the vocational schools.

14
00:39:21,997 --> 00:39:36,285
And we have machinery in there that labs at the Broad Institute have, and that Tufts University even comes down and uses and teaches us children with.

15
00:39:36,785 --> 00:39:42,408
We give our students excellent opportunities, and I'm so happy.

16
00:39:42,979 --> 00:39:49,122
to see this move forward and to see the collaboration amongst different programs.

17
00:39:49,882 --> 00:39:53,684
I could not be prouder of our teachers and our students.

18
00:39:54,024 --> 00:39:55,885
Thank you for representing Method so well.

19
00:40:03,459 --> 00:40:03,579
Ms.

20
00:40:03,619 --> 00:40:04,159
Van de Kloot?

21
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:11,143
Yes, Mayor Burke, while we're under suspension, I ask that we bring up the Medford Teachers Association next.

22
00:40:11,183 --> 00:40:14,645
They've asked if we could move them up.

23
00:40:15,385 --> 00:40:17,246
They're under community participation?

24
00:40:17,286 --> 00:40:17,446
Yes.

25
00:40:17,466 --> 00:40:20,408
Is there a member from the Medford Teachers Association that would like to address Ms.

26
00:40:20,428 --> 00:40:21,429
Charlene Douglas?

27
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:35,510
Good evening.

28
00:40:35,811 --> 00:40:37,332
Your name and address, please, for our record?

29
00:40:37,392 --> 00:40:38,513
Yes, she needs her glasses.

30
00:40:38,873 --> 00:40:41,615
Charlene Douglas, 414 High Street, Medford, Massachusetts.

31
00:40:41,875 --> 00:40:44,477
And Gina Coppola, 54 Yeomans Ave, Medford, Mass.

32
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,822
And I am president of the Medford Teacher Association.

33
00:40:51,682 --> 00:41:00,589
And I'm president of the Paraprofessional Association, standing here to let you know that our association wholeheartedly agrees with what you are about to hear from the MTA.

34
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:02,711
Thank you.

35
00:41:03,451 --> 00:41:03,812
Thank you.

36
00:41:04,012 --> 00:41:04,312
Thank you.

37
00:41:04,786 --> 00:41:10,749
So many people have come to me in the past two weeks concerned about Mr. Bellson's employment.

38
00:41:11,229 --> 00:41:14,691
That is not the reason why we are here tonight.

39
00:41:15,731 --> 00:41:21,294
We have no interest in his employment, and you will hear soon what we are concerned about.

40
00:41:22,775 --> 00:41:30,759
At this point, I'd like to ask all the members of the Meffitt Teacher Association, McGlynn School, and the Meffitt Paraprofessional Association to stand.

41
00:41:33,578 --> 00:41:34,718
and many are standing in back.

42
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:48,522
So tonight, I am here to speak on behalf of all the teachers at the McGlynn Middle School and on behalf of educators everywhere who stand up for themselves and their students.

43
00:41:49,242 --> 00:42:01,805
I am referring specifically to statements made by Superintendent Belson to the Method Police as reported by Captain Kevin M. Fahler in the McGlynn School Investigation Report.

44
00:42:02,205 --> 00:42:02,825
dated April 6, 2018.

45
00:42:04,046 --> 00:42:17,189
I hope you are all as troubled as we are by the inconsistencies in the poor judgment documented in the report and by the unanswered questions that still remain.

46
00:42:17,969 --> 00:42:24,831
I'm going to confine my remarks to our deep concerns about statements made by Mr. Belson concerning teachers.

47
00:42:25,691 --> 00:42:31,113
Let's begin with the statement by Mr. Belson in response to questions about why he didn't report

48
00:42:31,503 --> 00:42:33,924
the discovery of the gun clip to the police.

49
00:42:34,705 --> 00:42:41,108
On page 24 of the report, he is quoted as saying, rightly or wrongly, I didn't see it as a danger.

50
00:42:41,789 --> 00:42:50,414
The report goes on to say, Mr. Bellson stated that after he got busy and quote, really did not deal with it, unquote.

51
00:42:50,994 --> 00:42:57,938
Mr. Bellson stated that Mr. Edwards is also quote, under a great deal of fire by his faculty

52
00:42:58,516 --> 00:43:09,038
unquote, and that Mr. Belson currently has an, that Mr. Edwards, excuse me, and that Mr. Edwards currently has an MCAD case and an arbitration case against him.

53
00:43:09,678 --> 00:43:15,679
Mr. Belson stated that his faculty is angry at him, quote, not happy with us at all.

54
00:43:16,359 --> 00:43:24,101
Mr. Belson then reportedly thought to himself, quote, this doesn't seem like it should be elevated.

55
00:43:24,538 --> 00:43:27,039
You know one more thing, unquote.

56
00:43:27,799 --> 00:43:28,960
Let's reflect on this.

57
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:40,044
Mr. Belson is telling the police that he decided to downplay the incident to protect Mr. Edwards because members of Mr. Edwards' staff have taken legal action against him.

58
00:43:40,444 --> 00:43:52,228
This sends the message that when teachers use the proper legal channels to seek redress of grievances and improvements in teaching and learning conditions in their school, the administration may actually conceal information

59
00:43:52,585 --> 00:43:54,446
that could threaten the safety of our schools.

60
00:43:55,126 --> 00:44:00,327
That thought process, as described to the police, is very disturbing, but it gets worse.

61
00:44:00,867 --> 00:44:06,169
I will now read to you from a selection from the section of the report starting at the bottom of page 25.

62
00:44:07,289 --> 00:44:13,151
Mr. Belson stated, quote, I don't know if there's some sort of political setup here to get Jake.

63
00:44:13,691 --> 00:44:15,932
Jake is under a bit of fire, unquote.

64
00:44:16,552 --> 00:44:17,392
He reiterated,

65
00:44:17,748 --> 00:44:20,712
that Mr. Edwards does not get along with some of his teachers.

66
00:44:21,112 --> 00:44:24,436
He added that, quote, Jake is a decent human being.

67
00:44:24,777 --> 00:44:26,199
I don't see him doing that.

68
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:29,583
That is knowingly throwing away a gun magazine.

69
00:44:30,023 --> 00:44:30,724
I just don't.

70
00:44:31,245 --> 00:44:31,986
Was he set up?

71
00:44:32,506 --> 00:44:34,168
Were they really trying to get him?

72
00:44:34,809 --> 00:44:35,230
Unquote.

73
00:44:36,176 --> 00:44:45,601
Mr. Belson is posing a theory to the police that the McGlynn teachers, who do not get along with Mr. Edwards, may have set him up to try and get rid of him.

74
00:44:46,121 --> 00:44:50,744
That is the most outrageous, insulting, and implausible theory I have ever heard.

75
00:44:51,264 --> 00:44:56,827
It is also a clear attempt to deflect blame from himself and Mr. Edwards onto the teachers.

76
00:44:57,828 --> 00:44:59,168
Let me say this clearly.

77
00:44:59,729 --> 00:45:02,850
The teachers and other staff at the McGlynn are not to blame.

78
00:45:03,291 --> 00:45:05,932
In fact, they actually could have been victims.

79
00:45:06,358 --> 00:45:12,380
along with their students if the loaded magazine had been placed in the auditorium for malicious purposes.

80
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:24,303
For Mr. Belson to suggest that the gun clip incident may have been a setup by teachers who don't like Mr. Edwards is disappointing, discouraging, upsetting, disheartening, and false.

81
00:45:25,184 --> 00:45:30,385
In fact, that's how the McGlynn teachers feel this year, disappointed, discouraged, and disheartened.

82
00:45:31,025 --> 00:45:31,926
Here's the reality.

83
00:45:32,546 --> 00:45:35,947
The teachers at the McGlynn School have been working under adverse conditions

84
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:47,076
Conditions that led them to come up with their own school improvement proposal called the ABC plan that has constantly ignored through the fall and into the winter of the school year until Mayor Burke took it on.

85
00:45:47,736 --> 00:45:52,839
Despite these conditions, the McGlynn teachers have never stopped doing what's right for their students.

86
00:45:53,440 --> 00:46:06,187
Following me, you will hear from our McGlynn teachers about how they contribute to the school, the Memphis public school systems, and the community as a whole, even through years of lacking leadership, vision, and support.

87
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:13,622
They are hopeful for change and grateful for the current principal who is in place now and proving to be a strong leader.

88
00:46:14,422 --> 00:46:21,324
Before I turn the floor over to the teachers, I want to tell you that we are asking for in no uncertain terms.

89
00:46:21,965 --> 00:46:25,146
First, we demand a public apology from Mr. Belshen.

90
00:46:25,586 --> 00:46:29,467
He should apologize for downplaying the gun clip incident in order to protect

91
00:46:29,832 --> 00:46:43,340
Mr. Edwards from criticism as he admitted to the police, and he should apologize by making that suggestion, obviously without a shred of evidence, that somehow teachers were behind the gun clip incident to make Mr. Edwards look bad.

92
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:58,568
Second, we want to be assured that the school committee does not share the negative opinions about the McGlynn staff that Mr. Belson stated to the police, and we ask that you make a public statement voicing support for the educators in the McGlynn

93
00:46:58,905 --> 00:47:03,727
and indicating that these words are his own and are not shared by the Memphis School Committee.

94
00:47:04,147 --> 00:47:04,548
Thank you.

95
00:47:04,888 --> 00:47:07,889
At this point, I invite Brian Villard up to the mic.

96
00:47:11,551 --> 00:47:12,671
And other teachers from McGlynn.

97
00:47:14,212 --> 00:47:16,633
Brian Villard, 716 Main Street in Boxford.

98
00:47:17,473 --> 00:47:18,354
Thank you, Charlene.

99
00:47:18,534 --> 00:47:20,195
As always, we appreciate your support.

100
00:47:20,875 --> 00:47:23,596
Good evening, Honorable Mayor Burke and members of the school committee.

101
00:47:24,096 --> 00:47:27,278
We are the teachers of McGlynn, and we're here because we care.

102
00:47:28,655 --> 00:47:34,218
First and foremost, we'd like to say thank you to those of you who have heard our concerns and have truly listened to us.

103
00:47:34,699 --> 00:47:37,280
There has been so much positive in the school this year.

104
00:47:37,921 --> 00:47:41,663
We are encouraged by all of your efforts to help our school continually improve.

105
00:47:42,264 --> 00:47:47,927
We also appreciate your recognition of the wonderful community the teachers and staff have created at the McGlynn.

106
00:47:48,648 --> 00:47:53,070
However, we felt that the allegations in the police report could not go unrefuted.

107
00:47:53,811 --> 00:47:55,712
McGlynn teachers were extremely shaken

108
00:47:56,097 --> 00:47:59,380
and disappointed when we read some of the comments contained within it.

109
00:48:00,341 --> 00:48:03,444
We honestly don't know how exactly to respond.

110
00:48:04,385 --> 00:48:05,786
We feel misrepresented.

111
00:48:06,687 --> 00:48:12,273
So we thought what better way to clear the air than by telling you a little bit about what we have been doing with our time.

112
00:48:12,955 --> 00:48:17,576
Teachers have been working hard all year, both in and out of school, to educate the youth of Medford.

113
00:48:18,377 --> 00:48:24,759
We have stayed positive and focused our innovations on innovations and solutions to make our building better.

114
00:48:25,499 --> 00:48:34,422
This year, personally, I stepped up and joined the McGlynn site council, working with administration, faculty, parents, and students to propose positive change.

115
00:48:35,402 --> 00:48:40,603
I continued building school community by running the morning show program and highlighting the accomplishments of students.

116
00:48:41,423 --> 00:48:46,004
And I worked with Angela Bellini to establish the first annual lip-sync competition.

117
00:48:53,766 --> 00:48:55,647
Sherry Flint, Fay Street, Boston.

118
00:48:57,587 --> 00:49:05,592
This year, I wanted to say that I volunteered to host two different programs outside to help our science department.

119
00:49:06,412 --> 00:49:12,095
We hosted the Tufts biology department, and we also hosted Concord Consortium.

120
00:49:12,996 --> 00:49:24,703
I volunteered to have these groups into my room to give my students an opportunity to experience hands-on activities and curriculum and work with materials that they wouldn't otherwise be able to have

121
00:49:25,627 --> 00:49:28,033
And that's something that was very important to me this year.

122
00:49:28,053 --> 00:49:31,141
And I think our kids really benefited from that.

123
00:49:31,321 --> 00:49:31,582
Thank you.

124
00:49:37,377 --> 00:49:41,801
Hi, I'm Amy Villard, 716 Main Street in Foxhurst, Massachusetts.

125
00:49:43,203 --> 00:49:44,624
First of all, I love the McGlynn.

126
00:49:44,664 --> 00:49:45,945
The McGlynn is my second home.

127
00:49:45,985 --> 00:49:47,187
My best friends work here.

128
00:49:47,787 --> 00:49:49,809
I love it so much that I married a teacher there.

129
00:49:51,811 --> 00:49:55,635
But on top of that, I'm a sixth grade teacher, and I have an amazing team.

130
00:49:55,695 --> 00:50:00,359
And I'm going to read a couple of testimonials, not just from me, but from a couple of other members of my team who aren't here tonight.

131
00:50:06,148 --> 00:50:16,177
So some of the female sixth grade teachers on our floor in the springtime specifically, we work together to spend lunch with a group of sixth grade girls on Fridays in the spring.

132
00:50:16,277 --> 00:50:17,378
Being a middle school girl,

133
00:50:17,898 --> 00:50:19,720
As some of us know, it was really, really hard.

134
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:24,903
We worked to help the 6th grade girls feel connected and supportive of each other by creating a safe space.

135
00:50:25,344 --> 00:50:30,748
Each 6th grade girl receives a hand-delivered personal invitation to join us for a girls' lunch by the end of the school year.

136
00:50:31,068 --> 00:50:33,370
This is an opportunity to celebrate all of our strong,

137
00:50:33,770 --> 00:50:34,831
and smart girls.

138
00:50:35,211 --> 00:50:40,514
Activities include I'm Awesome Because, goal setting, meeting new friends, and what it means to be a middle school girl.

139
00:50:41,655 --> 00:50:44,977
Over the past five years, I've organized a running club for McGlynn students.

140
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:59,086
Many of the kids at our schools don't have a ton of things to do after school that are productive, and the kids really enjoy being active, being outside, setting goals, achieving them, and they culminate in a cross-country race in the fall and a little track race in the spring.

141
00:51:01,173 --> 00:51:05,675
This testimonial's from Michael Kremen, who's the sixth grade ELA teacher on my team.

142
00:51:06,696 --> 00:51:13,160
Over the 13 years that I've worked at the McGlynn, my team and I have purchased many items for students who are living in difficult situations at home.

143
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:16,922
We have brought students shoes, boots, coats, and other clothing.

144
00:51:17,382 --> 00:51:26,888
This year, along with Miss Bradshaw, who's our school adjustment counselor, we bought and collected dozens of winter coats, pairs of gloves, and mittens and hats for our students who did not have proper cold weather clothing.

145
00:51:27,369 --> 00:51:32,116
I routinely purchase food and snacks for the nurses who have told us how many kids come to school hungry.

146
00:51:32,557 --> 00:51:33,859
We do these things quietly.

147
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:35,502
We are not seeking praise.

148
00:51:35,742 --> 00:51:37,906
We do them because our students need them to be done.

149
00:51:38,813 --> 00:51:42,014
And then finally, Mrs. Taylor, who's the science teacher on my team.

150
00:51:42,715 --> 00:51:50,218
She works with Mrs. Trumbull and Mrs. Bellini to start the GEMS Club this year, which is Girls Exploring Math and Science.

151
00:51:50,618 --> 00:51:53,799
It's a very unique club to get girls more interested in STEM fields.

152
00:51:54,099 --> 00:51:57,421
We've been coming up with a curriculum and exciting activities to get the girls to come back.

153
00:51:57,861 --> 00:52:02,643
We have a core group of about 10 students who have been with us since we started, and this includes a few students from the Andrews.

154
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:04,303
We're excited to grow in the years to come.

155
00:52:04,984 --> 00:52:05,284
Thank you.

156
00:52:10,845 --> 00:52:14,767
Hi, I'm Kristen Zeckman, 55 Dunboy Street, Boston.

157
00:52:15,608 --> 00:52:17,329
And I teach eighth grade English.

158
00:52:18,109 --> 00:52:23,212
And my goal as an English teacher is to get the kids to be more passionate about reading and writing.

159
00:52:23,693 --> 00:52:26,094
And wherever they are, that's where I want to take them a step further.

160
00:52:26,254 --> 00:52:29,356
And when we do this is through the Scholastic Writing Awards.

161
00:52:30,116 --> 00:52:33,018
It's a big deal for a middle school student to win.

162
00:52:33,258 --> 00:52:38,341
And throughout the past several years, we've had winners in the middle school level from the Midlands specifically.

163
00:52:39,802 --> 00:52:47,346
And they often go on to win again in high school, and I think it's a great way for them to be recognized both locally and statewide.

164
00:52:47,366 --> 00:52:51,568
I also wanted to mention something that my coworker, Brett, does.

165
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:52,469
He's sitting over there.

166
00:52:52,869 --> 00:53:05,996
He raises money through a GoFundMe site so that we can bring in an acting troupe for Romeo and Juliet and give the kids this authentic learning experience so that they can actually see the show in person, not just act it out in school and things.

167
00:53:06,056 --> 00:53:07,757
So those are two examples.

168
00:53:07,857 --> 00:53:08,117
Thank you.

169
00:53:15,079 --> 00:53:15,439
How you doing?

170
00:53:15,799 --> 00:53:17,620
I'm Ryan McCarthy, 46 Colonial Ave.

171
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:22,581
I'm sorry, that was where I grew up, 176 Florence Road, Waltham.

172
00:53:23,181 --> 00:53:33,043
So I've been on staff at the McGlynn since 2004, and I'm very, very proud of my school, our school I should say, and all of the faculty that work there and the students and the work that they produce.

173
00:53:34,784 --> 00:53:40,065
Each year since I've been at school, and I've taken many of your, a couple of your children anyhow on the trip,

174
00:53:41,093 --> 00:53:42,514
we go on an environmental camp trip.

175
00:53:43,075 --> 00:53:44,856
And that's run completely by teachers.

176
00:53:45,677 --> 00:53:49,419
All teachers that attend the trip, you know, go, I think, above and beyond the call of duty.

177
00:53:49,499 --> 00:53:51,881
We, you know, we don't go home to our families that night.

178
00:53:52,601 --> 00:53:58,966
We create a very positive experience, a formative experience for the seventh graders each year.

179
00:53:59,126 --> 00:54:01,187
And we've done it, as I've said, every single year that I've been there.

180
00:54:01,707 --> 00:54:09,833
And we never have to take parent chaperones because we have, you know, hordes of teachers that are willing to step up and to do the right thing for the kids.

181
00:54:10,792 --> 00:54:21,265
Also, beyond that, just quickly, each year, the Medford Family Network, which is an organization, very local, they're looking for charitable donations around Christmas time.

182
00:54:21,886 --> 00:54:26,932
Mrs. Derding and others have organized this effort at our building, and each year, my homeroom

183
00:54:27,763 --> 00:54:36,626
coordinate an effort, and this year we were able to adopt a family of three, three children that is, and provide them with, you know, over $400 worth of gifts at Christmastime.

184
00:54:37,106 --> 00:54:40,908
That's, again, teachers stepping up, making donations, and also the students.

185
00:54:41,248 --> 00:54:42,528
The teachers are motivating the students.

186
00:54:43,008 --> 00:54:43,909
Very proud of the work we do.

187
00:54:50,831 --> 00:54:51,351
Good evening.

188
00:54:51,412 --> 00:54:55,433
My name is Patricia Kilbride, 11 Interville Street, Woburn, Massachusetts.

189
00:54:56,032 --> 00:55:08,519
I've been a special education teacher in Medford for 11 years, first at the Columbus in the therapeutic learning program, and then I was brought to the McGlynn for the language base, and I now teach grades six, seven, and eight in combination classes.

190
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:12,281
And I just have something to say from the special education teachers.

191
00:55:13,261 --> 00:55:25,248
For the past three years, special education teachers and paraprofessionals from the language base, connections, and access programs have worked to include our students in the talent show, lip sync battle,

192
00:55:25,647 --> 00:55:31,069
the New York trip, environmental camp, and other events.

193
00:55:31,569 --> 00:55:39,872
Teachers, paraprofessionals, and parents have collaborated extensively to make these events fun and accessible to our students with special needs.

194
00:55:40,572 --> 00:55:48,835
And I myself got to attend the New York trip last year with one of my students, and to see it through her eyes was phenomenal, and it was a great time.

195
00:55:49,195 --> 00:55:49,495
Thank you.

196
00:55:57,079 --> 00:55:57,579
Good evening.

197
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:02,361
My name's Hong Liu, H-O-N-G Liu, L-I-U.

198
00:56:02,981 --> 00:56:06,942
I've been in the public school system, Medford Public School, for 25 years.

199
00:56:07,702 --> 00:56:13,184
And for the past five years, I've been teaching as an ELL and math teacher.

200
00:56:14,264 --> 00:56:18,826
All I can say is, McGlynn Middle School is one of the best.

201
00:56:20,326 --> 00:56:26,108
The teachers are the most highly qualified, most hardworking,

202
00:56:26,816 --> 00:56:29,238
teachers every single day.

203
00:56:30,779 --> 00:56:33,522
This year, I happen to have a heavy load, so I work late.

204
00:56:33,982 --> 00:56:40,728
Around 5, 6 o'clock, I still see many teachers working there, including Miss Robin Irving.

205
00:56:41,909 --> 00:56:47,914
She is the first to be there getting the coffee for everyone, and she's almost the last one to leave.

206
00:56:48,414 --> 00:56:52,798
Many teachers with their children, young children, they work there as if

207
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:55,101
This is their family.

208
00:56:55,581 --> 00:56:59,123
So I want to give a bigger applause to the teachers.

209
00:56:59,723 --> 00:57:19,955
Also, I want to say, touched and inspired by the new principal, Mr. Nick Tucci, I helped

210
00:57:21,787 --> 00:57:34,255
CQO received two Red Sox luxury suite tickets to help inspire students to be the best and achieve the best with the Mustang Way.

211
00:57:34,555 --> 00:57:34,875
Thank you.

212
00:57:34,995 --> 00:57:42,900
All right.

213
00:57:42,940 --> 00:57:43,440
Good evening.

214
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:46,602
I'm Angela Bellini, 68 Glenwood Road, Somerville.

215
00:57:48,494 --> 00:57:51,175
I've worked at the McGlynn Middle School for the past six years.

216
00:57:52,295 --> 00:57:55,876
During this time, I've dedicated myself to the school and its students.

217
00:57:57,437 --> 00:58:11,621
I've stayed late almost every single day, coming up with new, engaging, hands-on labs and activities that allow the children to not only have fun in science, but to access the science curriculum in a really dynamic way.

218
00:58:13,601 --> 00:58:16,682
As Mrs. Taylor's testimonial mentioned earlier,

219
00:58:17,418 --> 00:58:28,384
we piloted a new club called Gems to allow girls from both middle schools to explore and have fun in STEM fields through hands-on lessons.

220
00:58:31,045 --> 00:58:41,150
This year, Mr. Villard and I also organized the McGlynn Middle School's first annual lip-sync battle, which allowed the students to have fun expressing themselves on stage and to compete for a trophy.

221
00:58:41,410 --> 00:58:42,271
That was pretty awesome.

222
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:48,918
For the past two years, I've also organized the environmental camp trip with help from Ms.

223
00:58:48,958 --> 00:58:49,319
Haas.

224
00:58:50,359 --> 00:58:55,663
And this trip has been recurring for the McGlynn 7th graders over the past 14 some odd years.

225
00:58:57,185 --> 00:59:02,188
This trip becomes a lifelong memory for a lot of the kids, and it went really, really well last week.

226
00:59:02,889 --> 00:59:07,712
I was really happy with the way that it turned out, and the kids, I asked them today, absolutely loved it.

227
00:59:07,812 --> 00:59:09,854
So it was really, really great.

228
00:59:12,650 --> 00:59:29,244
Lastly, myself and several other teachers spent countless hours after school, during vacations, and sometimes on weekends, putting together the thoughtful and comprehensive ABC plan, which was put together in response to the original McGlynn Action Plan that was brought forth to school committee earlier this school year.

229
00:59:30,965 --> 00:59:38,332
We want our school to be the best that it can be for the sake of our community and the students that we teach, and that's why we do what we do.

230
00:59:39,833 --> 00:59:40,974
We could go on and on.

231
00:59:41,622 --> 00:59:46,065
about the positive works of our staff, but we don't want to take up all of your evening.

232
00:59:47,626 --> 00:59:53,910
We encourage all of you to take the time to visit our school and to get to know the amazing staff at the McGlynn.

233
00:59:55,311 --> 01:00:04,297
Thank you so much for your time and for giving us the opportunity to express how much we care about our students, the school, and each other here at the McGlynn.

234
01:00:15,267 --> 01:00:16,207
Thank you for listening.

235
01:00:16,948 --> 01:00:17,628
Have a nice evening.

236
01:00:18,248 --> 01:00:18,708
Thank you.

237
01:00:18,728 --> 01:00:23,610
Mr. Paulson?

238
01:00:24,831 --> 01:00:39,977
Mayor, members of the school committee, ladies and gentlemen, at no time have I ever said that the McGuinn was a bad school, that the McGuinn teachers did not accomplish things, that the McGuinn teachers didn't do a good day's work.

239
01:00:40,917 --> 01:00:42,458
From time to time in my role,

240
01:00:42,934 --> 01:00:45,396
Sure, I question certain things from time to time.

241
01:00:45,896 --> 01:00:46,577
That's my job.

242
01:00:47,338 --> 01:00:48,699
I'm supposed to ask questions.

243
01:00:49,079 --> 01:00:49,740
That's what I do.

244
01:00:51,181 --> 01:00:57,866
Now, when this situation took place, the one person who took the direct heat for it was me.

245
01:00:58,287 --> 01:01:03,951
So the comment that I try to deflect the blame is clearly not true, and everyone knows it.

246
01:01:04,672 --> 01:01:06,353
I didn't throw anyone else under the bus.

247
01:01:06,914 --> 01:01:10,917
I took all the heat myself and accepted full responsibility for it.

248
01:01:12,490 --> 01:01:14,471
Now, a police investigation is what it is.

249
01:01:15,432 --> 01:01:24,777
People ask a lot of questions, and I was asked a lot of questions about a lot of possible scenarios, and what the climate was at that school, and what might be possible.

250
01:01:25,257 --> 01:01:28,138
And if you read the report very carefully, you'll see there's a lot of gaps.

251
01:01:28,999 --> 01:01:31,120
And some of those gaps do raise questions.

252
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:38,284
And before I go on at this point, Mayor, I'd like to ask the police chief to come up and explain the nature of a police report

253
01:01:39,088 --> 01:01:43,369
and to tell you that I answered questions that were put to me.

254
01:01:44,630 --> 01:01:51,572
There are some people who declined to answer questions and declined to reveal things, but I didn't.

255
01:01:52,452 --> 01:01:53,492
Chief, appreciate it.

256
01:01:57,974 --> 01:01:58,774
Name and address, please.

257
01:01:59,754 --> 01:02:03,896
I live at 227 Elm Street in Medford,

258
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:10,581
Chief here in the City of Medford.

259
01:02:13,083 --> 01:02:15,884
I just want to say one thing, if I may, Madam Chairman.

260
01:02:17,966 --> 01:02:20,087
I've said it in a number of forums before.

261
01:02:20,867 --> 01:02:22,328
The schools in Medford are safe.

262
01:02:23,409 --> 01:02:24,630
That has to be loud and clear.

263
01:02:25,433 --> 01:02:43,066
And they're safe, not by accident, they're safe because of all the people that are seated here tonight that work in those schools every single day, that keep a lid on things, they take care of business, they know who's causing a problem, they do what's appropriate to keep the schools safe.

264
01:02:43,526 --> 01:02:45,608
They deserve an awful lot of credit.

265
01:02:53,594 --> 01:03:09,019
And after this incident broke in February, when we first got the word at the police department about that, and then put a plan in place of how we were going to react from that point forward for a short period of time, I had the benefit of working a little bit at the McGlynn School.

266
01:03:09,899 --> 01:03:11,760
And I saw the love

267
01:03:12,204 --> 01:03:19,086
the care and the attention that the teaching staff give to every one of the children that enter that school every single day.

268
01:03:19,546 --> 01:03:23,447
Some of the coldest mornings, they were out there greeting them with a smile.

269
01:03:23,507 --> 01:03:25,647
I heard happy Monday, happy Tuesday.

270
01:03:27,108 --> 01:03:29,748
The young children running up, giving hugs to the teachers.

271
01:03:30,429 --> 01:03:31,609
You can't put a price on that.

272
01:03:31,909 --> 01:03:33,509
As the commercial says, it's priceless.

273
01:03:34,169 --> 01:03:36,030
But that's the type of staff that you have.

274
01:03:36,050 --> 01:03:40,311
They're a caring, nourishing environment for the children.

275
01:03:42,005 --> 01:03:52,250
The report, obviously you can't put every written word in the report, so it's better than a summary, but it's certainly not, you know, a big volume.

276
01:03:54,091 --> 01:03:59,813
Mr. Belson was very open and honest in his interview, very open.

277
01:04:00,134 --> 01:04:01,574
I mean, he suggested things.

278
01:04:02,715 --> 01:04:06,817
Captain Kevin Fowler was the officer that was charged with the investigation.

279
01:04:07,637 --> 01:04:09,418
He did a very thorough investigation.

280
01:04:10,116 --> 01:04:20,963
I have to say that Mr. Belson was very open in his interview and maybe to his detriment, maybe that's why we're here this evening because he said things that maybe some people didn't want to hear.

281
01:04:21,784 --> 01:04:28,948
I know in my conversation with Mr. Belson in the past, he wanted to make sure that we left no stone unturned.

282
01:04:29,709 --> 01:04:32,310
He wasn't pointing the finger of blame at anyone.

283
01:04:32,911 --> 01:04:39,215
He didn't want us to go with just the obvious, you know, what was obvious to us based on what was told to us at that point.

284
01:04:39,991 --> 01:04:43,553
Yes, as the police department, we know how to conduct an investigation.

285
01:04:44,014 --> 01:04:50,298
But I know that Mr. Belson cares very much about all of the schools, all of the teachers, and all of the students.

286
01:04:50,938 --> 01:04:53,160
And I think that's why he left it open-ended.

287
01:04:53,680 --> 01:05:09,150
He gave Captain Fowler somewhat of a climate of what was going on in the McGlynn School, just so that Captain Fowler had some kind of basis to say, OK, let's turn this other stone over and see where it leads us.

288
01:05:10,259 --> 01:05:17,604
I don't think there was an intent on Mr. Belson's part, and he can speak better than I can about it, to blame any one individual.

289
01:05:18,084 --> 01:05:19,004
He had questions.

290
01:05:19,785 --> 01:05:26,669
Captain Fowler ended his interview with Mr. Belson by asking him, is there anything that you want to add?

291
01:05:27,189 --> 01:05:31,092
Anything that maybe I didn't ask that you might want to

292
01:05:32,300 --> 01:05:43,003
put out there, and he reiterated some of the things that he had mentioned earlier about some of the climate in the school itself, which is probably not unlike any other school in any other school district.

293
01:05:43,624 --> 01:05:54,707
There's always something in play that causes someone who's not totally familiar with what goes on in that school to say, okay, let's go beyond just the obvious, what we have.

294
01:05:55,613 --> 01:05:57,575
We asked all of these questions early on.

295
01:05:57,755 --> 01:05:58,556
What was the motive?

296
01:05:58,676 --> 01:06:01,819
Why would someone, number one, how did it get into the school?

297
01:06:02,819 --> 01:06:06,222
Once it got into the school, how did it disappear from the principal's office?

298
01:06:07,083 --> 01:06:09,405
Did it actually make it into the principal's office?

299
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:12,168
A number of people are in there.

300
01:06:12,228 --> 01:06:22,837
We heard from some of the people that we interviewed that school's pretty much an open building for a good number of hours after the school day is over with basketball teams, basketball leagues.

301
01:06:24,275 --> 01:06:26,235
children coming and going, various doors.

302
01:06:27,416 --> 01:06:31,256
Until this incident happened, we really didn't have to give much thought to it.

303
01:06:31,776 --> 01:06:37,297
Now it caused everyone to focus and say, you know, we have to tighten up on the security of the building.

304
01:06:38,978 --> 01:06:42,178
But that was only brought to light by the interviews that were conducted.

305
01:06:43,398 --> 01:06:46,159
If you have specific questions for me, I'd be glad to answer.

306
01:06:46,219 --> 01:06:47,739
I just want to clear the air.

307
01:06:48,379 --> 01:06:53,120
Mr. Paulson did not want to, he said it numerous times, he didn't want to put anyone under the bus.

308
01:06:53,601 --> 01:06:56,882
He accepted blame for not making the notification.

309
01:06:58,202 --> 01:07:07,205
And I know in working with Roy in the past, he tries to minimize things, not to disrupt the school system, to keep the learning environment as normal as possible.

310
01:07:08,205 --> 01:07:13,307
When we were forming the STARS program in Nemlech, that was Roy's main bone of contention.

311
01:07:13,807 --> 01:07:22,910
How do you deal with a major incident, but still keep the learning environment as normal as possible, so that the students aren't disrupted and the teaching staff is not disrupted?

312
01:07:23,962 --> 01:07:30,305
I think he realizes that, in this case, he made an error by not reporting it sooner.

313
01:07:30,825 --> 01:07:32,606
If anything, he would have got it off his plate.

314
01:07:32,646 --> 01:07:35,948
It would have been on my plate a lot earlier, and then the burden would be on me.

315
01:07:36,348 --> 01:07:37,369
What do I do about it?

316
01:07:38,309 --> 01:07:43,471
And quite honestly, in this interview, that's the avenue that he was coming from.

317
01:07:44,812 --> 01:07:45,552
It was his fault.

318
01:07:45,793 --> 01:07:46,553
He took the blame.

319
01:07:47,368 --> 01:07:49,869
Are we ever gonna find out how that clip got into the school?

320
01:07:50,050 --> 01:07:53,912
It doesn't appear unless someone out there who has knowledge and wants to come forward now.

321
01:07:55,433 --> 01:07:56,893
That's the only way we're gonna find out.

322
01:07:57,854 --> 01:08:02,577
Were there discrepancies by some of the other individuals that may have been interviewed?

323
01:08:02,697 --> 01:08:11,542
There were some discrepancies in the story in at least one individual's story of what they said about what they knew and what took place.

324
01:08:12,022 --> 01:08:13,523
But other than that,

325
01:08:14,216 --> 01:08:28,249
I have to say that Mr. Belson was just at the police station giving Captain Fowler a clear overview of what's going on, what the dynamics are in the city, and what the dynamics are at the McGlynn School as a whole.

326
01:08:29,490 --> 01:08:32,953
But at no time did he blame any individual group.

327
01:08:33,374 --> 01:08:36,737
I know there's quotes in there, and I know that maybe some things

328
01:08:38,648 --> 01:08:45,951
When you put a quote in and you don't put the full paragraph in that probably goes along with that quote, things can be taken out of context.

329
01:08:45,991 --> 01:08:52,534
And I apologize for that if I caused disruption in the school system for that reason.

330
01:08:53,534 --> 01:09:01,217
But I know that the avenue that Mr. Belson was coming from was that, please, don't just go with the obvious.

331
01:09:01,738 --> 01:09:04,339
Turn all the stones over and see where that leads.

332
01:09:04,379 --> 01:09:05,299
And that's what was done.

333
01:09:05,319 --> 01:09:06,740
That's why there was such a delay.

334
01:09:08,023 --> 01:09:09,564
in the investigative report.

335
01:09:09,864 --> 01:09:13,065
And unfortunately, we're all upset that we couldn't get a conclusion.

336
01:09:13,085 --> 01:09:30,271
There's nothing more frustrating to expend numerous hours and not come up with an answer as to how did the clip get there, who did it belong to, how did it disappear from the office, and just trying to find the whodunit patch.

337
01:09:31,832 --> 01:09:33,112
And that's what's frustrating.

338
01:09:33,172 --> 01:09:34,733
But the report speaks for itself.

339
01:09:36,512 --> 01:09:50,837
I'm glad to answer any questions that anyone may have, but I know that Mr. Bellson was not looking to, certainly not looking to cause this problem here this evening, and nor was I. Thank you, Chief.

340
01:09:51,118 --> 01:09:53,859
I'd like to continue for a minute.

341
01:09:53,879 --> 01:10:03,822
As the Chief pointed out, I didn't name a single individual at that school or anywhere else that I thought was responsible for anything.

342
01:10:03,842 --> 01:10:05,723
I took the blame myself.

343
01:10:06,677 --> 01:10:14,864
even though I never saw the clip, I had no chain of custody of the clip, and I had conflicting opinions coming at me from all angles.

344
01:10:15,824 --> 01:10:16,645
But I took the blame.

345
01:10:17,866 --> 01:10:28,134
Now, if anyone feels offended or upset, or feels that I did finger them inappropriately, then you have my apology, because that is not my intent.

346
01:10:29,075 --> 01:10:35,020
My intent was to aid the police department in their investigation, as the chief said, to leave no stone unturned.

347
01:10:36,247 --> 01:10:47,177
to let them know everything that was going on in that school, everything that was happening, because who can possibly know all the things that might have been possible at that point in time?

348
01:10:48,478 --> 01:10:50,900
My goal was to aid the police department.

349
01:10:52,922 --> 01:11:00,289
You know, it's tough enough some days for all of us in our very respective jobs, but I didn't go there with a lawyer.

350
01:11:01,323 --> 01:11:03,103
I didn't ask for any representation.

351
01:11:03,263 --> 01:11:08,885
I just simply answered the questions and provided the information that was asked of me.

352
01:11:09,985 --> 01:11:16,026
And once again, if there are members of the faculty who feel that I offended them, I apologize.

353
01:11:17,026 --> 01:11:20,087
I have no doubt that each of you is a dedicated professional.

354
01:11:20,927 --> 01:11:24,628
I have no doubt that each of you wants to do a great job for our young people.

355
01:11:25,528 --> 01:11:30,369
And in fact, as I look out, as I've been around a little while, I've probably hired most of you.

356
01:11:31,529 --> 01:11:34,410
probably was the person who signed your employment letter.

357
01:11:36,251 --> 01:11:41,734
Clearly, I believe that the McGlynn can be a good school and is a good school.

358
01:11:42,494 --> 01:11:43,855
We've had some differences this year.

359
01:11:44,275 --> 01:11:44,955
That's factual.

360
01:11:46,356 --> 01:11:48,237
This isn't brand new this month.

361
01:11:49,758 --> 01:12:00,543
But I believe going forward that good things can happen and that if we all put our mind to it, we're gonna make a difference and it's gonna work out just fine.

362
01:12:02,507 --> 01:12:03,788
So I appreciate you listening.

363
01:12:04,708 --> 01:12:06,550
I'm happy to answer any questions anyone has.

364
01:12:06,570 --> 01:12:09,892
Mike, do you want to say something at this point?

365
01:12:11,112 --> 01:12:11,332
Okay.

366
01:12:11,633 --> 01:12:13,134
I have a person with me.

367
01:12:15,695 --> 01:12:17,096
Please step forward, please.

368
01:12:23,300 --> 01:12:24,180
Your name and address, please.

369
01:12:24,441 --> 01:12:24,681
Yes.

370
01:12:25,461 --> 01:12:27,082
My name is Marilyn Blumzak.

371
01:12:27,943 --> 01:12:30,764
I am a former resident of Medford for 52 years.

372
01:12:32,235 --> 01:12:37,738
My husband was the city solicitor for the city of Medford for 33 years.

373
01:12:38,438 --> 01:12:49,564
I am proud to say that I was a Medford teacher and still am a paying member of NEA and the Massachusetts Teachers Association.

374
01:12:50,484 --> 01:12:56,668
It's a distinct pleasure for me to be a teacher, particularly in this city that I love.

375
01:12:57,948 --> 01:12:59,609
I've resided here for 52 years.

376
01:13:02,197 --> 01:13:14,767
when I, my youngest of four was in junior high school, had the privilege of being president of the Lawrence Memorial Hospital Auxiliary.

377
01:13:15,187 --> 01:13:30,979
And at that point, I was doing a health career fair for the Lawrence Memorial Hospital when Mr. Bellison suggested that I come and help him write a grant

378
01:13:31,395 --> 01:13:40,779
called CETA, the Comprehensive Educational Training Act, and the city of Medford received monies for that grant.

379
01:13:41,699 --> 01:13:47,282
I wanted to tell you today, to remind you, that we live in very troubled times.

380
01:13:49,543 --> 01:13:53,184
I don't envy any one of you elected officials.

381
01:13:53,584 --> 01:13:56,105
You're doing the best job that you possibly can.

382
01:13:56,205 --> 01:14:00,027
Stephanie, all of the members of the school committee, the city council,

383
01:14:01,467 --> 01:14:07,291
The mayor certainly has a big responsibility, but so does Mr. Bellson.

384
01:14:08,272 --> 01:14:09,893
You trust him as voters.

385
01:14:10,833 --> 01:14:15,056
I trust him as a friend, as a teacher.

386
01:14:15,196 --> 01:14:19,880
He was a civics teacher many, many years ago before he became a teacher.

387
01:14:20,460 --> 01:14:27,425
He's always had the interest of his teachers and the children in this city at heart.

388
01:14:28,225 --> 01:14:30,727
He is a sincere, dedicated,

389
01:14:31,267 --> 01:14:32,688
trustworthy gentleman.

390
01:14:33,509 --> 01:14:38,692
He has served the city of Medford diligently for many, many, many years.

391
01:14:39,793 --> 01:14:40,974
He's apologized.

392
01:14:41,654 --> 01:14:45,817
He might have done wrong, but again, we're in troubled times.

393
01:14:46,958 --> 01:14:58,907
We have to trust the chief, Buddy Sacco, all of the people that we elect, and hopefully all of you in your hearts can see that this man deserves your praise.

394
01:14:59,975 --> 01:15:01,596
and all of you deserve your praise.

395
01:15:02,037 --> 01:15:09,482
I salute all of you and say to all of the people behind me that if you want to make a difference, go out and vote.

396
01:15:19,509 --> 01:15:19,790
Thank you.

397
01:15:20,617 --> 01:15:23,658
I just wanted to address the McGlynn teachers.

398
01:15:24,679 --> 01:15:42,047
I appreciate their coming down tonight and telling the school committee what individually they've been up to in their classrooms and outreaching with students and to really take a hold this year and in previous years as well, but really to work and

399
01:15:43,950 --> 01:15:46,791
maximize the potential for every student at the McGlynn.

400
01:15:47,571 --> 01:15:54,254
It's unfortunate that it's under these circumstances, perhaps, but it's always great to hear from our faculty members.

401
01:15:55,795 --> 01:15:58,656
I do not make the leap that I think some have.

402
01:15:59,376 --> 01:16:00,537
There was a lot of tension.

403
01:16:00,637 --> 01:16:01,337
We know that.

404
01:16:01,457 --> 01:16:06,579
I think that's a fact that there was tension at the school this year, earlier, and in fact many of the

405
01:16:07,337 --> 01:16:27,958
McGlynn teachers came and addressed the school committee, but in no way, shape, or form does that mean or should it imply that we don't have the greatest respect for our McGlynn teachers, that we don't value their input each and every day, and that we aren't extremely proud to know that these are

406
01:16:28,568 --> 01:16:31,109
our staff, our people who are working at the school.

407
01:16:31,790 --> 01:16:33,190
I only see bright things.

408
01:16:33,410 --> 01:16:38,913
I know, you know, there's some turbulent times, but out of turbulent times, we will get better.

409
01:16:39,733 --> 01:16:44,455
And so I thank you very much for coming and appreciate the statements of those who came.

410
01:16:45,856 --> 01:16:46,196
Thank you.

411
01:16:47,137 --> 01:16:47,817
Mr. Ruggiero.

412
01:16:50,238 --> 01:16:51,839
Chief Sacco, can I ask you a question, please?

413
01:16:58,512 --> 01:17:02,735
So, reading through the report, I can understand some of the teachers' frustrations.

414
01:17:02,875 --> 01:17:06,017
I just want to make sure, this is absolutely clear.

415
01:17:06,758 --> 01:17:17,746
Do you or any of your officers believe that Superintendent Nelson floated a conspiracy theory that perhaps there was some sort of setup?

416
01:17:18,426 --> 01:17:20,528
I just want to make sure absolutely clear.

417
01:17:20,848 --> 01:17:23,730
I think the answer is obvious, but I want to make sure from your mouth.

418
01:17:24,263 --> 01:17:32,689
So none of your officers feel like there was any sort of a sense of Roy Belson trying to say there was some cabal to take down the principal, is that correct?

419
01:17:34,230 --> 01:17:39,494
I don't believe it, nor do the officers that were involved in the investigation believe that.

420
01:17:39,734 --> 01:17:47,620
It was just something that was put out there as a reminder, as I said earlier, don't just go with the obvious, look at everything.

421
01:17:49,662 --> 01:17:50,162
That was not

422
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:53,741
Obviously, if it was something, many more people would have been interviewed.

423
01:17:53,801 --> 01:17:58,082
We would have conducted the investigation in a different manner.

424
01:17:58,522 --> 01:18:06,544
So I think that tells you as of early March when we interviewed Mr. Belson, nothing further came from that.

425
01:18:06,604 --> 01:18:14,646
We didn't go to any other teacher, administrator, or anyone else that wasn't already on our list to interview based on what we had at that point.

426
01:18:15,286 --> 01:18:20,127
So as far as any kind of conspiracy theory, we never operated under that.

427
01:18:21,700 --> 01:18:29,746
I just want to make, from my opinion, from talking, I've talked, had the opportunity, the blessing of talking to a number of the teachers, and I've also talked to a number of the parents.

428
01:18:30,847 --> 01:18:35,550
I've heard so many wonderful things about how hardworking

429
01:18:36,817 --> 01:18:42,841
almost, I can't even think of an exception, all of the McGlynn teachers I've talked with.

430
01:18:43,282 --> 01:18:48,906
And I just want to express my sincere gratitude for all the hard work you do.

431
01:18:49,606 --> 01:18:52,908
As a former teacher myself, I was never a successful middle school teacher.

432
01:18:54,510 --> 01:18:57,652
I find middle school teaching the most difficult of all teaching.

433
01:18:58,753 --> 01:19:04,717
And so I have a deep, deep appreciation for all the hard work you do, and I thank you very much.

434
01:19:05,817 --> 01:19:13,220
I hope that it's pretty clear that this is maybe a misreading or a misunderstanding of what the report was made.

435
01:19:13,320 --> 01:19:22,724
I do not believe that Roy Bellson ever tried to throw the teachers under the bus as if any of you would ever lay bullets in an auditorium in a safe space.

436
01:19:23,784 --> 01:19:25,425
I just can't imagine any of you doing that.

437
01:19:25,445 --> 01:19:28,106
So thank you, and I'm sorry about this miscommunication.

438
01:19:29,078 --> 01:19:29,839
Mr. Benedetto.

439
01:19:30,419 --> 01:19:31,160
Thank you very much.

440
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:57,639
I recently found out that I had read the report and the first time I read it, it didn't jump out at me that the teachers would take it this way because Roy has given, Mr. Bellson has given us different scenarios of what could have happened to have that gun clip be left in there, whether,

441
01:19:59,118 --> 01:20:00,799
It was this scenario or many others.

442
01:20:00,879 --> 01:20:04,922
He's given a few ideas for people to look at.

443
01:20:05,162 --> 01:20:06,303
So it didn't jump out at me.

444
01:20:06,863 --> 01:20:13,648
But when it came to my attention and I reread this section, I could see how you would feel and take this in this manner.

445
01:20:14,909 --> 01:20:18,811
And for that, as a school committee, I'm sorry that you felt that way.

446
01:20:19,352 --> 01:20:25,716
Because I value the work that you do with the students in our community more than I could ever say in words.

447
01:20:26,623 --> 01:20:36,225
I value the extra time, the extra mittens when they're cold, the hugs when their parents leave them at the door and they miss their mommy.

448
01:20:36,745 --> 01:20:41,126
And I don't care if they're kindergarten or eighth grade, there are days when you miss your mom.

449
01:20:42,366 --> 01:20:47,627
So you take care of the students both academically and emotionally.

450
01:20:48,307 --> 01:20:51,047
And if your emotions were hurt by this, I feel bad.

451
01:20:51,607 --> 01:20:54,488
And as a community member, I want you to know

452
01:20:55,454 --> 01:21:01,055
I, as a member of this committee, value your work every single day, every single night.

453
01:21:01,895 --> 01:21:16,598
And recently, I was just at your school on Saturday night, and I saw your new assistant principal there, working hard and late and missing an evening out with her family and her friends to make sure your school was safe.

454
01:21:16,718 --> 01:21:16,918
Ms.

455
01:21:17,019 --> 01:21:23,960
Lu, I don't know if you're here, but I want you to know I appreciate you holding down the foot in this very difficult year.

456
01:21:24,844 --> 01:21:26,125
You've done amazing work.

457
01:21:35,529 --> 01:21:43,113
And I was at the play the other night, and the kids had the biggest smile, and they performed, and it was so uplifting.

458
01:21:43,173 --> 01:21:52,017
And it was after a day I moved my oldest child out of my house, so I was so happy to see kids and see them singing and dancing.

459
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:55,582
even though I was missing my own children being that age again.

460
01:21:55,962 --> 01:22:00,885
So it was joyful and happy, and I was glad to see that happening at the McGlynn.

461
01:22:01,325 --> 01:22:10,870
So again, I want to thank you all and renew my commitment to you as a committee member, that I am here any time that you feel that you have something to say.

462
01:22:17,236 --> 01:22:23,304
If I could just make a comment from the chair, I've had the privilege of getting to know quite a few of you over the past few months.

463
01:22:24,219 --> 01:22:25,640
And the job you do is amazing.

464
01:22:26,021 --> 01:22:28,623
How much you care about your school is outstanding.

465
01:22:29,283 --> 01:22:31,665
And we're just really, really proud to have you there.

466
01:22:32,126 --> 01:22:39,292
I hope that parents, fifth grade parents out there, see these wonderful people and change their mind about where they want to send their child.

467
01:22:39,612 --> 01:22:43,956
And no disrespect, Mr. DeLiva, but you guys are amazing.

468
01:22:44,376 --> 01:22:45,897
You do work every single day.

469
01:22:45,917 --> 01:22:47,018
A lot of it goes unnoticed.

470
01:22:47,038 --> 01:22:51,122
Mr. Kremen will be laying all the flags for Memorial Day in just a few short weeks.

471
01:22:51,802 --> 01:22:54,943
all on his own because he thinks it's important, and it is important.

472
01:22:55,363 --> 01:23:02,025
So there are things that you do on a daily basis that go unnoticed, but you touch so many hearts along the way.

473
01:23:02,145 --> 01:23:08,086
So just know that we respect your work, all of the administrators as well, of the work that you do on a daily basis.

474
01:23:08,226 --> 01:23:11,367
It's not just education anymore.

475
01:23:11,387 --> 01:23:13,808
I mean, it's way different than how when we were little.

476
01:23:14,268 --> 01:23:18,869
So things have drastically changed, and your patience level and your commitment is outstanding.

477
01:23:20,117 --> 01:23:21,978
We support you and we applaud your work.

478
01:23:22,298 --> 01:23:22,679
Thank you.

479
01:23:27,442 --> 01:23:36,547
So first, I want to say thank you, Mr. Belson, for doing the right thing and for apologizing for these comments that did offend many people.

480
01:23:36,947 --> 01:23:41,450
And thank you for the school committee for your support and continued support this year.

481
01:23:41,850 --> 01:23:49,215
And we look forward to working with you and making sure that the McGlynn is seen as a truly great school that it is.

482
01:23:49,645 --> 01:23:50,526
Thank you all very much.

483
01:23:50,546 --> 01:23:50,586
Hi.

484
01:23:59,732 --> 01:24:00,773
May I have the address, please?

485
01:24:00,813 --> 01:24:03,215
Ann Marie Cuneo, 871 Felsway, Medford, Mass, 02155.

486
01:24:04,596 --> 01:24:10,820
I just want to say, as a former school committee member, I didn't have the opportunity last time the McGlynn parents came up.

487
01:24:11,301 --> 01:24:15,223
But it is, I'm sorry, McGlynn teachers and administration came up.

488
01:24:15,263 --> 01:24:18,806
But as a parent of the McGlynn, I want to say that

489
01:24:19,307 --> 01:24:46,058
your strides in your everyday, I'm sorry, it's addressing them, but what you do on an everyday basis is really immeasurable, and if you don't believe us as parents, just think when the older kids that are in high school and in college, when they're all coming back into your building and they're looking for you, that's gratification, and that shows that you're all doing the right thing.

490
01:24:46,538 --> 01:24:51,683
So unfortunately there's high emotions going on, but we are very proud of both of our middle schools.

491
01:24:51,743 --> 01:24:54,625
And as parents, I can say I've had them at both schools.

492
01:24:55,246 --> 01:24:57,107
And you need to find your fit.

493
01:24:57,347 --> 01:25:00,370
It doesn't matter how many children you have, you need to find your fit.

494
01:25:00,470 --> 01:25:01,991
So I just want to say thank you to all of you.

495
01:25:02,051 --> 01:25:02,392
Thank you.

496
01:25:07,236 --> 01:25:11,119
All right, thank you very much for coming tonight.

497
01:25:11,359 --> 01:25:11,660
Thank you.

498
01:25:14,957 --> 01:25:17,321
Also, while we're under suspension, we have Ms.

499
01:25:17,381 --> 01:25:28,800
Melanie McLaughlin and Angela Munsell-Moore regarding family and community engagement, a status update on the investigation, and the successful plan for superintendent and deputy superintendent.

500
01:25:38,323 --> 01:25:41,728
Hello school committee members, Madam Mayor, community.

501
01:25:42,129 --> 01:25:46,375
My name is Melanie Perkins McLaughlin and I live on Alston Street in Medford.

502
01:25:46,395 --> 01:25:52,303
Hi all, I'm Angela Moore and I'm on Vine Street in Medford.

503
01:25:54,063 --> 01:26:00,545
So we wanted to come before you folks and before the community to ask some questions that we had and concerns that we had.

504
01:26:01,106 --> 01:26:06,407
I know that you know Angela and I as regular attendees of the school committee meetings.

505
01:26:06,427 --> 01:26:07,848
We've been coming for several years.

506
01:26:08,848 --> 01:26:10,969
Also have children in the school district.

507
01:26:11,029 --> 01:26:14,170
I have two high schoolers and a elementary schooler.

508
01:26:14,190 --> 01:26:22,153
I'm also the co-chair of the Medford Special Education Parent Advisory Council, representing approximately 800 families in the district.

509
01:26:23,484 --> 01:26:36,127
And one of the things we wanted to talk about was it was really, really interesting to watch tonight's events because so much of what I feel like we all watch tonight is family and community engagement.

510
01:26:37,087 --> 01:26:41,688
And it's an important part of what we really need to have as Medford moves forward.

511
01:26:41,788 --> 01:26:50,430
I hope that Dr. Edward Vincent watches these archival meetings to understand what it is we are looking for and what we need.

512
01:26:50,550 --> 01:26:59,892
And everyone knows that we had a very unfortunate event and we had an unfortunate meeting that occurred in February where there was a lot of heated emotions and where there was a lot of

513
01:27:02,444 --> 01:27:05,866
And people talked about that for a long time in the community afterwards.

514
01:27:05,906 --> 01:27:10,330
And they talked about how terrible that meeting was in so many different ways.

515
01:27:10,550 --> 01:27:16,155
And what wasn't talked about, unfortunately, in my opinion, was what brought that about.

516
01:27:16,675 --> 01:27:24,001
Not so much the incident itself, but the lack of family and community engagement in our community.

517
01:27:24,882 --> 01:27:31,307
Even this context where you have to be willing to stand up at a podium and speak into a microphone.

518
01:27:32,627 --> 01:27:38,248
with your back turned to the rest of the community to be able to converse and express what your feelings are.

519
01:27:38,729 --> 01:27:42,929
I mean, I went on to the website earlier today to just sort of look at what the protocol is.

520
01:27:43,009 --> 01:27:46,030
And I understand protocol and the need for protocol.

521
01:27:46,150 --> 01:27:49,771
You have to get the business part of it going and the meeting moving along.

522
01:27:50,751 --> 01:27:54,352
You know, but the website is you have to submit in writing your request.

523
01:27:54,372 --> 01:27:55,692
You have to do it a week ahead of time.

524
01:27:55,712 --> 01:27:57,053
You have exactly three minutes.

525
01:27:57,093 --> 01:27:59,053
You can come up to the podium and you can talk to us.

526
01:28:00,323 --> 01:28:02,584
That's not family and community engagement.

527
01:28:03,464 --> 01:28:07,226
I had the benefit last year of going to graduate school, and I really enjoyed my time there.

528
01:28:07,246 --> 01:28:16,450
I had a great teacher who helped write for the Department of Education at the federal level the family and community engagement guidelines and some material there.

529
01:28:16,550 --> 01:28:20,112
And one of the things they talk about is family and community.

530
01:28:20,152 --> 01:28:21,492
We're all part of the community.

531
01:28:21,512 --> 01:28:23,373
So the teachers that came up tonight are the community.

532
01:28:23,413 --> 01:28:25,554
The school committee members are the community.

533
01:28:26,034 --> 01:28:27,275
Our shop owners are the community.

534
01:28:27,315 --> 01:28:28,375
The parents are the community.

535
01:28:28,715 --> 01:28:29,996
We're not just families.

536
01:28:30,496 --> 01:28:35,205
or teachers or people that don't have children.

537
01:28:35,485 --> 01:28:36,908
We're all a community together.

538
01:28:36,928 --> 01:28:40,274
I had this really great experience last week where

539
01:28:41,386 --> 01:28:48,332
I set up an appointment to talk with our new EL director, Paul Texera, and we had the best conversation.

540
01:28:48,652 --> 01:28:59,440
We sat in his office for just about an hour, and I learned a little bit about him, he learned a little bit about me, and we both walked away from that experience wanting to work together and really wanting to collaborate with each other.

541
01:29:00,001 --> 01:29:05,385
And I thought, you know, what would have happened if we hadn't built those relationships with each other, if we didn't know each other?

542
01:29:05,885 --> 01:29:07,587
And that's what family and community engagement is.

543
01:29:07,647 --> 01:29:10,389
It's about building relationships and about knowing each other.

544
01:29:11,070 --> 01:29:21,960
Folks might recall when this all happened a few months ago, there was a post on social media where one of Mr. Belson's family members talked about who Mr. Belson is as a man.

545
01:29:23,155 --> 01:29:26,537
And we heard from his friend earlier talking about who Mr. Belson is as a man.

546
01:29:27,138 --> 01:29:32,642
And personalizing Mr. Belson and personalizing each one of us is what builds community and relationship.

547
01:29:32,962 --> 01:29:38,726
And I think people are able to relate much better to who he was as a man because we learned about who you are as a man.

548
01:29:39,246 --> 01:29:42,228
Tonight, seeing you apologize, we learned about who you are as a man.

549
01:29:42,789 --> 01:29:45,230
And that's the important piece of family and community engagement.

550
01:29:45,330 --> 01:29:47,071
It's collaboration and communication.

551
01:29:47,432 --> 01:29:48,572
We're not doing it enough.

552
01:29:48,973 --> 01:29:50,274
And we can't say enough about that.

553
01:29:50,314 --> 01:29:51,715
And that's why I stand before you tonight

554
01:29:52,666 --> 01:29:55,828
for more family and community collaboration.

555
01:29:56,248 --> 01:29:57,289
Bring people to the table.

556
01:29:57,329 --> 01:29:58,390
I was watching Justin tonight.

557
01:29:58,410 --> 01:29:59,891
I'm so glad Justin's here.

558
01:30:00,671 --> 01:30:01,972
That's a relatively new thing.

559
01:30:02,132 --> 01:30:03,193
That's a great thing.

560
01:30:04,373 --> 01:30:08,876
More roundtable discussion, not having to come up to the podium and ask and talk.

561
01:30:08,956 --> 01:30:10,677
Or you guys were inundated with emails.

562
01:30:10,717 --> 01:30:12,298
I'm glad you were inundated with emails.

563
01:30:12,358 --> 01:30:14,460
I say to anybody watching tonight, keep them coming.

564
01:30:14,840 --> 01:30:20,523
Keep communicating, please, because we need you to communicate to make a difference and to make things transparent.

565
01:30:21,624 --> 01:30:31,970
So getting to the transparent piece, even in the past few months with everything that's been going on, there's still been sort of concerns around some of the transparency.

566
01:30:32,170 --> 01:30:38,173
And what you saw the night in February and what I witnessed, which was, frankly, traumatizing for me.

567
01:30:38,213 --> 01:30:44,497
I don't know about other people, but I was sort of shell-shocked when I left there at the anger and the vitriol that was there that night.

568
01:30:44,917 --> 01:30:47,939
But I was also really very clear what the message was.

569
01:30:48,099 --> 01:30:50,120
And it was, we don't feel like we're being heard.

570
01:30:50,561 --> 01:30:59,984
And in any relationship, as people can attest in their marriage or their relationship with their children or what have you, when you feel like you're not being heard, what typically happens?

571
01:31:00,604 --> 01:31:01,144
You yell.

572
01:31:01,344 --> 01:31:02,025
You're angry.

573
01:31:02,825 --> 01:31:04,125
You get out of control.

574
01:31:05,326 --> 01:31:07,166
But when you're being heard, you're collaborating.

575
01:31:07,186 --> 01:31:08,006
You're working together.

576
01:31:08,166 --> 01:31:09,167
So that's what we need to do.

577
01:31:09,687 --> 01:31:19,670
So in the most recent Committee of the Whole meeting, when we found out by social media that the decision to extend the superintendent's contract went from

578
01:31:20,425 --> 01:31:24,988
April to June, that was not family and community engagement.

579
01:31:25,428 --> 01:31:29,150
That was a really bad example of the lack of family and community engagement.

580
01:31:29,911 --> 01:31:33,413
And again, none of this is personal for me around Mr. Bellson.

581
01:31:33,493 --> 01:31:38,516
We've had everybody knows we've had our differences, Mr. Bellson, but we've always been very professional and respectful with each other.

582
01:31:38,536 --> 01:31:40,977
It's never been personal and it never will be.

583
01:31:42,158 --> 01:31:47,982
But in terms of having community transparency to find out on social media that this decision was reversed was so unfortunate.

584
01:31:48,002 --> 01:31:50,063
It was like, oh, it felt like we were moving forward

585
01:31:50,503 --> 01:31:59,065
and we were gaining some momentum and some trust, and then this happened, and you could see it in the response on social media, the way so many community members felt about that.

586
01:32:00,086 --> 01:32:14,310
But if they had just been consulted with ahead of time, if people had just had an idea, even the notice was, you know, that there's a committee of the whole meeting and that there was going to be some discussion, which frankly was at the same time as the National Honor Society meeting, which is what I was attending,

587
01:32:16,154 --> 01:32:20,776
that there was going to be some discussion that this might even be the case, you would have had a much larger turnout, I have no doubt.

588
01:32:21,217 --> 01:32:25,859
And people would have felt like they were invested in that decision and had some momentum and part of that decision.

589
01:32:25,959 --> 01:32:40,486
So I guess what I want to ask as we're talking about transparency and moving forward and, you know, hoping that you folks will hear us, and I know that we've done presentations in the past as a CPAC talking about family and community engagement and the need for it.

590
01:32:41,145 --> 01:32:46,606
And I think that this is really a fascinating study, frankly, in family and community engagement this past year that we've had here.

591
01:32:47,506 --> 01:32:50,787
But I guess the questions I have is, I have a few questions.

592
01:32:50,967 --> 01:33:00,389
One is how, also I want to mention that we also had a public records request in a few months ago that has not been responded to.

593
01:33:00,449 --> 01:33:08,310
And when we try to submit the public records request through the website, we get a mail or DM back that says the public records request is not accessible.

594
01:33:09,148 --> 01:33:12,510
And again, I just kind of feel like it's a metaphor for the scenario.

595
01:33:12,891 --> 01:33:19,555
And so I'd love for folks to look into that as well, because if a community member has a public records request, it shouldn't be a mail-or-demon back.

596
01:33:19,715 --> 01:33:26,960
And once we've notified the community, the school, that it is a mail-or-demon, hopefully it's fixed and people respond to that constituent.

597
01:33:28,561 --> 01:33:29,482
So questions we have.

598
01:33:29,522 --> 01:33:34,105
How is the community made aware that the vote would be to continue the superintendent contract from

599
01:33:35,186 --> 01:33:40,150
April 30th to June 30th, effectively reversing the February decision.

600
01:33:40,190 --> 01:33:43,212
I'm wondering how the community was made aware that that was going to be the vote.

601
01:33:44,013 --> 01:33:44,954
That's the first question.

602
01:33:44,974 --> 01:33:50,218
The second is, did any school committee members let their community or constituents know

603
01:33:50,752 --> 01:33:52,213
this would be a consideration.

604
01:33:52,813 --> 01:33:54,113
If so, how was that done?

605
01:33:54,153 --> 01:33:55,814
And if not, I'm wondering why.

606
01:33:55,834 --> 01:34:06,838
And then also we're wondering about the survey results for the superintendent and how or whether they were shared from the community survey that was done, asking folks what they would like.

607
01:34:08,099 --> 01:34:08,399
Thank you.

608
01:34:10,099 --> 01:34:10,700
Mr. Russo.

609
01:34:11,580 --> 01:34:15,381
I can speak quickly to the survey results, like five times now I've written down.

610
01:34:15,401 --> 01:34:16,882
Get those results out to the public.

611
01:34:17,582 --> 01:34:18,783
The challenge is that

612
01:34:19,898 --> 01:34:28,660
they're the open-ended questions, or the other, where you could then become open-ended, is printed like this.

613
01:34:29,480 --> 01:34:40,722
And I at least feel a responsibility, although I don't know that it's technically a responsibility, to at least read them all before dumping them into the public.

614
01:34:40,802 --> 01:34:49,104
Because a quick search of a couple of words that you might see in a survey, if you have kids, you've probably seen these kinds of words.

615
01:34:49,857 --> 01:34:54,698
You know, personal attacks on staff members, that kind of stuff.

616
01:34:54,718 --> 01:35:07,280
Like, I feel like some things deserve to at least have a conversation about whether they should be redacted from the release, or to ask, you know, our lawyer, should this be included in the release?

617
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:10,040
And I just have not been able to get through.

618
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:19,362
Now, I do believe I released to the committee, I don't remember if I released it to the public, the purely, you know,

619
01:35:20,055 --> 01:35:26,658
the statistics kind of stuff, which doesn't have anything interesting, like what percentage were men and women and all that other stuff.

620
01:35:28,720 --> 01:35:32,642
So if that hasn't been released, I can certainly release that.

621
01:35:33,322 --> 01:35:39,345
But honestly, the important and interesting stuff is not in the numbers.

622
01:35:41,938 --> 01:35:46,459
There's just really very little surprising in the numbers, although you should still be able to see them.

623
01:35:47,399 --> 01:35:51,261
It's in that really detailed stuff that people had to say.

624
01:35:51,281 --> 01:35:57,362
And believe me, people had a lot to say on the 470 responses or so.

625
01:35:58,362 --> 01:36:01,003
There was nobody who didn't have a lot to say.

626
01:36:01,123 --> 01:36:04,424
So that's what I had to say about the survey.

627
01:36:05,044 --> 01:36:11,146
If I could just add on the survey, it was used for the search committee purposes to get the search committee off the ground.

628
01:36:12,390 --> 01:36:17,033
Everything that happened in the search committee was executive session, basically, the equivalent of it.

629
01:36:17,453 --> 01:36:23,557
So now that we're out, you should turn them over and we can redact if there's something offensive.

630
01:36:24,338 --> 01:36:26,179
But otherwise, it's benign.

631
01:36:26,979 --> 01:36:27,139
Ms.

632
01:36:27,159 --> 01:36:27,680
Van de Kloot?

633
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:31,722
Melanie, I just wanted to mention one thing.

634
01:36:31,742 --> 01:36:40,408
I think that your call for community and family engagement was heard very much by the school committee and is reflected in the choice of our new superintendent.

635
01:36:41,497 --> 01:36:49,182
Certainly, as we went about interviewing people and talking to them, that was a major concern.

636
01:36:49,562 --> 01:37:00,628
And in fact, we've picked someone who we feel will be able to broaden family engagement and reach into communities that perhaps have been, not perhaps, but have been underrepresented.

637
01:37:01,449 --> 01:37:09,133
So I think that that is an extremely important point and that we heard you very clearly

638
01:37:10,017 --> 01:37:19,082
and know that that is a concern that we would like to make sure that we're broadening community and family engagement.

639
01:37:20,062 --> 01:37:28,226
By the way, one of the things that you mentioned about the podium and the way you come here, that's one of the reasons why many of us actually prefer committees of the whole, because it's a much more

640
01:37:28,811 --> 01:37:35,776
feeling of collaborative discussion when we're around the table versus here, which is a much more formal presentation.

641
01:37:36,257 --> 01:37:41,541
And remember, as you speak, part of the thing is your face is to the camera.

642
01:37:42,141 --> 01:37:49,227
And so while you're here, it's always awkward because your face is, you know, your back is to the community, but there's the larger community at home.

643
01:37:52,229 --> 01:37:56,052
And as far as that meeting, it was a special meeting of the school committee.

644
01:37:56,072 --> 01:37:57,073
It was not a committee of the whole,

645
01:37:57,973 --> 01:37:59,094
It's a nomenclature, right?

646
01:37:59,134 --> 01:37:59,554
Same thing.

647
01:38:00,054 --> 01:38:02,955
But that was posted the way all of the meetings were posted.

648
01:38:02,975 --> 01:38:06,077
And I know there were some parents that did show up at that meeting.

649
01:38:06,177 --> 01:38:13,040
And we held it before the Honor Society meeting, because three of us went over to that right from the end of that meeting.

650
01:38:13,780 --> 01:38:15,841
So it was public.

651
01:38:16,161 --> 01:38:19,342
It was as public as any other meeting that we hold, just like tonight.

652
01:38:23,284 --> 01:38:23,944
Mr. Ruggiero.

653
01:38:24,344 --> 01:38:25,765
How the issue was brought up

654
01:38:27,282 --> 01:38:32,668
It was, I was under the impression that we were going to discuss the transition strategy.

655
01:38:33,789 --> 01:38:35,531
That is the notice that was made.

656
01:38:36,532 --> 01:38:45,942
I didn't, it would have probably been more helpful to the community and to me as a member if the discussion was about continuing Roy Belson's contract.

657
01:38:47,700 --> 01:38:56,064
Because I wasn't, personally, I wasn't really prepared to have all the reasons and to rehash through the argument other than what I did.

658
01:38:57,584 --> 01:38:58,505
But I share your concerns.

659
01:38:59,631 --> 01:39:07,294
because I do believe that it was an important decision to make, and I think more community input would have been very helpful, as I made clear during the meeting.

660
01:39:07,314 --> 01:39:20,298
Actually, if I could, the meeting posting said the purpose of the meeting is to determine administrative leadership of the school system from May 1st to June 30th, 2018, and to take appropriate actions to implement the same.

661
01:39:20,738 --> 01:39:25,240
Further, the school committee may discuss relevant transition plans consistent with the completion

662
01:39:25,758 --> 01:39:27,919
of the superintendent search and selection process.

663
01:39:28,119 --> 01:39:36,223
Yeah, but it doesn't say that Roy, just a clarification, it does not say that in addition, Roy Bellson's contract may be extended.

664
01:39:36,523 --> 01:39:42,626
The idea of the, while what we, I do not claim that what we did was a violation of open meeting law, I don't think so.

665
01:39:42,726 --> 01:39:43,066
It wasn't.

666
01:39:43,106 --> 01:39:49,829
But it would have been more clear to the community if that issue of Roy Bellson's extended contract was made more clear.

667
01:39:50,909 --> 01:39:51,369
And thank you.

668
01:39:51,429 --> 01:39:55,091
And Madam Mayor, respectfully, I agree.

669
01:39:55,211 --> 01:40:06,675
I think that I didn't go to the meeting myself because I thought that it was a sort of procedural interim, you know, what we were going to do, which I thought was pretty clear that it would likely be deputies.

670
01:40:08,336 --> 01:40:12,998
Obviously, I was uninformed, but it didn't say specifically about Mr. Belson.

671
01:40:13,178 --> 01:40:15,319
Had it, I would have been at the meeting.

672
01:40:16,718 --> 01:40:17,299
Excuse me.

673
01:40:17,319 --> 01:40:18,440
So I think that that's the point.

674
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:19,541
I'm sorry.

675
01:40:19,701 --> 01:40:22,163
The committee could vote anything that night.

676
01:40:22,183 --> 01:40:24,045
It wasn't dictated what was going to happen.

677
01:40:24,065 --> 01:40:24,245
Right.

678
01:40:24,405 --> 01:40:24,946
I understand.

679
01:40:24,966 --> 01:40:25,906
I totally understand that.

680
01:40:25,926 --> 01:40:33,353
But I guess what I'm saying in the interest of family and community engagement, we didn't hear that and we didn't hear what we needed to hear to be at the meeting.

681
01:40:33,413 --> 01:40:36,476
And so from a family perspective, it wasn't communicated effectively.

682
01:40:37,772 --> 01:40:46,057
And to add on to that point, I mean, I would like to suggest that these important decisions are made during regular committee meetings.

683
01:40:46,777 --> 01:40:57,702
I understand that sometimes we do need to go into executive session or committee of the wholes, but that particular issue should have been televised so the whole community could hear it.

684
01:40:58,643 --> 01:41:04,286
It's unfortunate that the community had to sort of hear about it secondhand.

685
01:41:04,346 --> 01:41:06,387
It creates an environment of mistrust.

686
01:41:07,862 --> 01:41:08,182
Thank you.

687
01:41:08,482 --> 01:41:09,423
Mr. Russo's next.

688
01:41:12,644 --> 01:41:22,248
My question, you mentioned about this format, which I don't think anybody actually thinks this is the most enjoyable format, especially that one spot.

689
01:41:22,368 --> 01:41:25,169
This is actually much less of a challenge than that spot.

690
01:41:25,529 --> 01:41:36,234
But I'm just curious, and I'm not a history teacher, and I have no civics education other than the one I got in high school, but are there other formats for this

691
01:41:37,048 --> 01:41:41,670
are implemented in this country that people know of?

692
01:41:41,970 --> 01:41:46,212
Or is this really, I mean, I just sort of assume this is the default format everywhere.

693
01:41:47,773 --> 01:41:55,116
I think that you look, there can be something as simple as handheld microphones and people could stand at either end and address all of you.

694
01:41:56,157 --> 01:42:01,279
It's simple if you think outside of the box a little bit about, well, what feels welcoming and this is not welcoming.

695
01:42:02,220 --> 01:42:02,980
It's intimidating.

696
01:42:03,421 --> 01:42:05,723
And so what do we do to make somebody feel less intimidated?

697
01:42:05,783 --> 01:42:06,684
And I couldn't agree more.

698
01:42:06,704 --> 01:42:09,086
I think Dr. Edward Vincent is going to be all over that.

699
01:42:09,686 --> 01:42:11,748
And I'm really happy and very pleased.

700
01:42:11,768 --> 01:42:13,649
And thank you all very much for your hard work on that.

701
01:42:13,689 --> 01:42:15,011
I know how hard you worked on that.

702
01:42:15,051 --> 01:42:17,933
And thank you for the privilege of being on the superintendent search committee.

703
01:42:18,093 --> 01:42:18,914
It was a great privilege.

704
01:42:20,075 --> 01:42:20,275
Yeah.

705
01:42:20,955 --> 01:42:21,276
Thank you.

706
01:42:22,757 --> 01:42:23,477
Mr. Benedetto.

707
01:42:23,658 --> 01:42:23,978
Thank you.

708
01:42:24,158 --> 01:42:25,519
I actually requested the meeting.

709
01:42:26,380 --> 01:42:28,942
I requested the meeting because May 1st was coming.

710
01:42:29,894 --> 01:42:42,578
and my understanding that Mr. Belson was retiring as of April 30th, and that we needed to have an official person named as acting superintendent to get us through the transition.

711
01:42:43,198 --> 01:42:57,422
So I had no idea that there were other options at play that were gonna be presented that evening, so I too was shocked that this came up at this meeting,

712
01:42:59,435 --> 01:43:13,422
I assumed the vote of the committee, and when the committee voted to extend him to April 30th, I took on that as that's my new role, is to support him till that point, and then make sure our district has somebody at the helm.

713
01:43:14,102 --> 01:43:16,343
So I really pushed to have this meeting.

714
01:43:18,324 --> 01:43:25,648
So it was a little quicker than some, and it was a special meeting to discuss it, my understanding that is

715
01:43:26,212 --> 01:43:38,877
someone within the district would step into that role, whether a deputy, a principal, someone we felt confident, you know, to help us through because Mr. Belson was also going to be present.

716
01:43:39,337 --> 01:43:48,140
And knowing him, as we all do, we know he works way beyond the hours required, and he was being contracted to continue for 25 hours.

717
01:43:48,440 --> 01:43:52,962
So he was accessible to help with any bigger issues, and I'm sure

718
01:43:53,443 --> 01:43:58,646
with his dedication to this community over all these years, that he would wholeheartedly do that.

719
01:43:59,926 --> 01:44:06,930
So I honestly was shocked by the outcome of that meeting.

720
01:44:08,090 --> 01:44:10,772
It didn't even enter my mind as a possibility.

721
01:44:11,272 --> 01:44:21,177
Had I thought that that was a possibility, I would have, like I do usually, hey, important things are being discussed and put it on social media, please come.

722
01:44:22,120 --> 01:44:28,401
right, please come, or I would have requested that the meeting be televised, because I have done that also in the past.

723
01:44:29,061 --> 01:44:33,482
And I know we're getting new cameras in different areas, so we can do that.

724
01:44:34,902 --> 01:44:38,183
Because transparency is extremely important.

725
01:44:39,043 --> 01:44:49,405
And people not finding out important information online is, they feel insulted to find it out that way.

726
01:44:52,209 --> 01:45:06,023
I don't know what to say about the outcome of the meeting, but I can own that I did bring it forward and did not tell a push for it to be, because I thought it was just an interest, you know, an interim person stepping in for two months.

727
01:45:07,084 --> 01:45:07,444
Thank you.

728
01:45:07,544 --> 01:45:07,704
Ms.

729
01:45:07,744 --> 01:45:08,105
Mustone.

730
01:45:08,425 --> 01:45:11,488
Thank you, Maribel.

731
01:45:11,808 --> 01:45:16,693
I don't know about everyone, but likewise, I thought someone who was in administration was going to step in.

732
01:45:17,405 --> 01:45:19,766
not realizing that's not in their contract.

733
01:45:19,886 --> 01:45:32,232
So when we did receive multiple angry emails that night and the next morning, I did respond saying, I went in assuming, shame on me, that someone in administration would step into that role per contract.

734
01:45:32,692 --> 01:45:39,395
The other option was that the Massachusetts Association School Committees can take someone almost like an emergency superintendent.

735
01:45:39,956 --> 01:45:45,098
So to me, having a middle man or middle woman come in for eight weeks, try to transition,

736
01:45:45,935 --> 01:45:50,318
while we have, I almost feel like Dr. Maurice is like the Phoenix out of the ashes.

737
01:45:50,418 --> 01:45:54,040
Like this is going to be a whole new public school system.

738
01:45:54,840 --> 01:46:11,309
And I did not think that was the best choice to have a middle person, um, that I think Mr. Velson is, has the knowledge and the history to give our new superintendent and just looking forward that we needed that transition to be smoothly done.

739
01:46:11,329 --> 01:46:11,390
And,

740
01:46:12,884 --> 01:46:20,687
I know people don't agree with that, but I think it would have been more detrimental to our school system to bring someone in for eight weeks, and I stand by that decision.

741
01:46:21,527 --> 01:46:22,127
Mr. Seng.

742
01:46:22,147 --> 01:46:26,329
Do you have a microphone there?

743
01:46:26,569 --> 01:46:26,829
I don't.

744
01:46:26,889 --> 01:46:29,030
Okay, step up.

745
01:46:29,490 --> 01:46:29,950
There you go.

746
01:46:31,651 --> 01:46:41,034
Okay, well, I thank you for coming up and saying what a lot of our community is thinking and has been thinking throughout the past few years.

747
01:46:41,847 --> 01:46:50,233
And I'll say, when I read the notice for that meeting, I also didn't take it as you would take the vote that you took.

748
01:46:51,193 --> 01:46:54,876
And a lot of adults didn't take it that way either.

749
01:46:55,276 --> 01:46:59,259
And I think the notice did say exactly what the meeting would be about.

750
01:46:59,639 --> 01:47:00,220
It didn't lie.

751
01:47:00,280 --> 01:47:01,240
There were no lies in it.

752
01:47:01,721 --> 01:47:02,901
It stated the truth.

753
01:47:03,382 --> 01:47:07,004
But there's a part of it that includes communication.

754
01:47:09,133 --> 01:47:14,296
communicating to school committee members, to the general public about what the meeting might entail.

755
01:47:14,796 --> 01:47:20,440
And because of laws, you can't talk outside of a meeting.

756
01:47:20,460 --> 01:47:22,421
That's the problem.

757
01:47:22,861 --> 01:47:26,523
Yeah, and that's a huge problem that acts as a roadblock.

758
01:47:26,583 --> 01:47:37,069
But maybe allowing the public to know via social media, which you guys are all very good about, but to know via social media what

759
01:47:37,910 --> 01:47:41,471
might happen in a meeting, and to tell people, come.

760
01:47:41,631 --> 01:47:42,391
Come to this meeting.

761
01:47:42,811 --> 01:47:44,132
I think that really helps out.

762
01:47:44,972 --> 01:47:55,795
I'll say, from the student perspective, when we read that on Facebook, or when our friends texted the news, there were two reactions, generally.

763
01:47:56,075 --> 01:47:59,056
One was, what the heck?

764
01:47:59,536 --> 01:48:01,016
How did this just suddenly happen?

765
01:48:01,456 --> 01:48:05,297
And the other reaction was, oh, he was in for it.

766
01:48:05,477 --> 01:48:07,178
We knew that this would happen anyways.

767
01:48:07,987 --> 01:48:11,490
And, you know, both reactions aren't positive for our community.

768
01:48:11,591 --> 01:48:16,956
It's not positive for the school community, not positive for the general public, not positive for Mr. Bellson and his leadership.

769
01:48:17,857 --> 01:48:20,259
And I think a more open culture.

770
01:48:21,673 --> 01:48:30,318
the so-called new Medford, I think that's what we want to try and foster, what we want to try and sponsor, and how we deal with these issues going on.

771
01:48:30,818 --> 01:48:47,727
So being more open about what meetings might entail, and even, I would say, try more to advertise the committee of the whole meetings, because they're kind of put aside, and they allow for a more relaxed context, but I think it's important for people to know that these are important meetings,

772
01:48:49,272 --> 01:48:51,074
important stuff gets done in these meetings.

773
01:48:51,194 --> 01:48:52,455
I think that's super important.

774
01:48:53,396 --> 01:48:56,078
And I know Mr. Rousseau does this.

775
01:48:56,138 --> 01:48:57,259
He does town halls.

776
01:48:57,439 --> 01:48:59,861
He does meet the school committee member.

777
01:49:00,281 --> 01:49:04,344
And I think that's a great way for people in the community to engage with school committee members.

778
01:49:04,565 --> 01:49:09,008
So I say we have to take a step back, look at the bigger issue.

779
01:49:09,028 --> 01:49:09,729
It's about trust.

780
01:49:10,690 --> 01:49:14,533
And we need to build that trust between the general public and the Medford School Committee.

781
01:49:14,573 --> 01:49:17,115
And there's trust, but it can be stronger.

782
01:49:18,331 --> 01:49:19,091
Thank you, Justin.

783
01:49:19,912 --> 01:49:21,052
Very eloquent, Justin.

784
01:49:21,072 --> 01:49:24,794
Thank you.

785
01:49:24,834 --> 01:49:24,994
Ms.

786
01:49:25,034 --> 01:49:26,635
Kretz.

787
01:49:26,815 --> 01:49:47,504
Yes, so I, too, that night, I knew we were having a meeting, and we hadn't been able to talk about who would be the interim superintendent, so we got to talk that night, and I thought maybe somebody would be stepping up into that place, but we did have to make a decision in the best interest of everybody, like the students and the staffing,

788
01:49:48,122 --> 01:49:50,823
while we waited to hire our new superintendent.

789
01:49:50,883 --> 01:50:03,607
So, you know, I stand by my decision, and it was more of in the best interest of the schools and the students to keeping, you know, so we would have the training until the end of the school year.

790
01:50:03,627 --> 01:50:07,528
Because I have been getting a lot of questions from parents, who's gonna be the superintendent?

791
01:50:07,968 --> 01:50:09,269
And there's also been confusion.

792
01:50:09,689 --> 01:50:11,849
Some people thought we already hired a superintendent.

793
01:50:12,110 --> 01:50:14,310
So it's just been a little bit of confusion all around.

794
01:50:15,631 --> 01:50:16,411
But so,

795
01:50:17,105 --> 01:50:20,266
I stand by the decision that I made that night, as well.

796
01:50:20,586 --> 01:50:21,086
Thank you, Ms.

797
01:50:21,106 --> 01:50:21,366
Kratz.

798
01:50:21,586 --> 01:50:22,307
Mr. Benedetto?

799
01:50:22,427 --> 01:50:23,647
Thank you so much, Mayburg.

800
01:50:24,107 --> 01:50:32,049
I still have some questions, so I need some transparency and clarity on what exactly the superintendent's role is for the rest of this year.

801
01:50:32,450 --> 01:50:37,611
Will he have whole power as the superintendent?

802
01:50:37,651 --> 01:50:43,733
Will he be hiring and moving people and promoting people and providing raises?

803
01:50:44,200 --> 01:50:49,702
And I also heard a few rumors that he's telling people that he's going to be here beyond June 30th.

804
01:50:50,443 --> 01:50:51,823
Is that a possibility?

805
01:50:51,923 --> 01:50:54,064
Is there something about that happening?

806
01:50:54,644 --> 01:50:59,987
I just want to put it all out here while we're on camera and everybody's in the room.

807
01:51:00,607 --> 01:51:05,449
I just have these general questions and if someone could answer them for me and any other questions that come up.

808
01:51:06,149 --> 01:51:12,752
I just want to know are the rules we put in place in February for him to continue to April 30th still in place?

809
01:51:13,387 --> 01:51:16,049
or have they been removed?

810
01:51:16,149 --> 01:51:18,411
I'm really not sure what we voted for that night.

811
01:51:18,851 --> 01:51:21,553
None of those other restrictions have been removed.

812
01:51:22,254 --> 01:51:33,462
So he cannot hire people or move people or give raises or promotions unless it's like something to just provide services till June 30th.

813
01:51:33,603 --> 01:51:40,628
Anything beyond that, our new superintendent would be making those choices like department heads and all of that.

814
01:51:41,268 --> 01:51:42,069
Yes, of course.

815
01:51:42,550 --> 01:51:54,641
And the rumors that I'm hearing that he's telling people that he might be staying past June 30th, has anybody talked to him about doing any consulting beyond that point?

816
01:51:55,842 --> 01:51:58,104
No, this body has not talked about that.

817
01:51:58,864 --> 01:51:59,024
Ms.

818
01:51:59,044 --> 01:52:00,586
Van de Kloot.

819
01:52:00,606 --> 01:52:08,733
Mayor Burke, I just think that there may be positions that we want the superintendent to move on, and so I'm not,

820
01:52:09,442 --> 01:52:10,762
excluding that as a potential.

821
01:52:10,822 --> 01:52:12,143
But they have to be reviewed by us.

822
01:52:12,243 --> 01:52:15,203
Yes, but they would be, we would be part of that discussion.

823
01:52:15,463 --> 01:52:24,565
Now, of course, you know, um, and you know, I think the superintendent has made it very clear that he would also want to include, uh, the superintendent elect as well.

824
01:52:25,285 --> 01:52:37,068
Um, but to say there's going to be nothing happening to, um, until July 1st, I don't want that to be, um, the feeling there, there, there certainly needs to be movement.

825
01:52:37,428 --> 01:52:37,968
For instance,

826
01:52:38,577 --> 01:52:43,882
we might very well want to solidify our principal at the McGlynn, for example.

827
01:52:45,244 --> 01:52:47,046
We don't want to wait until July 1st to do that.

828
01:52:47,246 --> 01:52:51,170
Well, I would like to see the new superintendent make those choices.

829
01:52:51,590 --> 01:52:58,877
If that superintendent told us that they had flexibility in coming forward, I'm sure Mr. Belson can give

830
01:53:00,648 --> 01:53:11,874
the information, but the final decision, even restructuring of the central administration, you know, putting those positions back in place, I think that should be the new superintendent's place.

831
01:53:12,214 --> 01:53:20,838
I don't think that a new superintendent should step in and, you know, have to work with what's been hired from an outgoing superintendent.

832
01:53:21,178 --> 01:53:26,361
His input can be done by June 30th, and then the new superintendent should have the final decision.

833
01:53:27,415 --> 01:53:29,697
We have positions like director of foreign language.

834
01:53:30,417 --> 01:53:32,799
Interviews are scheduled to begin.

835
01:53:32,819 --> 01:53:34,260
It's already been posted.

836
01:53:34,280 --> 01:53:35,761
We have applications in.

837
01:53:36,621 --> 01:53:39,924
Neil from City Hall on diversity is going to be sitting in on the interviews.

838
01:53:40,504 --> 01:53:42,826
And then when they make a recommendation, it will come to us.

839
01:53:43,393 --> 01:53:44,274
We need to move forward.

840
01:53:44,314 --> 01:53:46,736
We cannot just go into freeze.

841
01:53:46,936 --> 01:53:48,417
These sirens are going off everywhere.

842
01:53:48,537 --> 01:53:53,081
Is there a way to include the new superintendent-elect in those?

843
01:53:53,101 --> 01:53:55,402
I asked her the other night if I could.

844
01:53:55,763 --> 01:54:03,389
I asked her the other evening if she would have an opportunity to assist us, and she said she would try to the best of her ability.

845
01:54:03,409 --> 01:54:04,770
This is before we offer her the position.

846
01:54:05,310 --> 01:54:11,415
That she has a commitment to Boston through the end of the year, but she would make every effort to rearrange her schedule so that she could

847
01:54:12,347 --> 01:54:15,908
help us get through things and possibly even be part of the budget process.

848
01:54:16,368 --> 01:54:20,829
So, Mayor Burke, can I answer that question about the director of foreign language?

849
01:54:20,909 --> 01:54:32,033
For instance, so say the new superintendent wants our foreign languages to develop in a different road than we currently have in MEDFED.

850
01:54:33,133 --> 01:54:34,513
Maybe a different language.

851
01:54:35,053 --> 01:54:40,055
So say the new director of foreign language teaches

852
01:54:42,033 --> 01:54:46,260
a program that we might not be moving forward for for the next five years.

853
01:54:46,721 --> 01:54:54,114
I would hate for that to happen when the new superintendent, like she talked about Mandarin in one of her interviews, I remember her.

854
01:54:55,135 --> 01:54:55,955
speaking about that.

855
01:54:56,175 --> 01:55:02,757
So she might have a new direction and new programs in her mind of how to move MedFit forward.

856
01:55:02,797 --> 01:55:13,100
And if we hire someone in a role that has what we currently have and what not our future is going to be, we could be tying our hands.

857
01:55:13,400 --> 01:55:18,621
So that's why the importance of not hiring directors are important to me.

858
01:55:18,741 --> 01:55:20,502
So I really would like

859
01:55:21,616 --> 01:55:41,350
to either let her make those decisions on, you know, bring the finalists to her, maybe do the preliminary work, but really have some more input from the new superintendent and what her vision for our school district is gonna be rather than the outgoing superintendent, and someone have to work within those restraints.

860
01:55:41,450 --> 01:55:43,111
What we have to wait.

861
01:55:43,311 --> 01:55:44,272
Mr. Superintendent.

862
01:55:45,675 --> 01:55:51,702
So let me try to address this a little bit so we can clarify these things for everyone's benefit.

863
01:55:52,843 --> 01:55:57,988
I have had a very extensive conversation with Dr. Edward Vincent.

864
01:55:58,849 --> 01:56:01,072
She met with us before she toured our schools.

865
01:56:02,170 --> 01:56:16,539
We had a good exchange of ideas of what was necessary to happen so that when she came aboard, she wouldn't be mired in doing a lot of functional and organizational things that would take an extraordinary amount of time.

866
01:56:18,401 --> 01:56:20,282
We have a number of open positions.

867
01:56:21,743 --> 01:56:30,929
Any departmental position that got hired would be subject to the professional status law, which means they only have one year.

868
01:56:32,987 --> 01:56:36,888
So if, in fact, they did get hired, they could be replaced within that one year.

869
01:56:38,008 --> 01:56:45,630
The second piece is that to leave all these things for an individual to come in would destabilize the school system.

870
01:56:45,890 --> 01:56:47,250
We have after school programs.

871
01:56:47,270 --> 01:56:49,451
A director of early childhood is leaving.

872
01:56:49,531 --> 01:56:51,011
They run the after school programs.

873
01:56:51,031 --> 01:56:53,232
They oversee the family network.

874
01:56:53,652 --> 01:56:55,252
All these things have to be taken care of.

875
01:56:56,052 --> 01:56:58,453
I can assure you that the mayor

876
01:56:59,112 --> 01:57:05,617
And I have talked considerably about including people in the discussions, including Mr. Osborne, so we can promote diversity.

877
01:57:07,138 --> 01:57:13,283
But I can assure you that the way we hire administrators is they always come before you, remember?

878
01:57:13,743 --> 01:57:15,284
These major administrative positions.

879
01:57:16,045 --> 01:57:17,146
And you get a chance to input.

880
01:57:18,207 --> 01:57:22,029
And I'm sure that Dr. Edward Vinson will have every opportunity to input.

881
01:57:22,630 --> 01:57:26,253
But if we stop our business right now, in July,

882
01:57:27,580 --> 01:57:35,147
Our successor is going to have one heck of a responsibility to put things together in two months, less than two months before school opens.

883
01:57:35,967 --> 01:57:37,789
And that's not a desirable outcome.

884
01:57:38,830 --> 01:57:43,954
Secondly, there are a whole pile of responsibilities with teachers and other things of that type.

885
01:57:44,615 --> 01:57:49,098
Leaves of absence, maternities, all kinds of things that have to be dealt with.

886
01:57:50,760 --> 01:57:51,560
Got to be dealt with.

887
01:57:52,221 --> 01:57:54,163
You don't want to drop that on your new person.

888
01:57:55,697 --> 01:57:57,758
I can assure you that you're going to be involved.

889
01:57:59,339 --> 01:58:04,863
I can assure you that Dr. Edward Vincent's going to be involved, because I'm rooting for her success.

890
01:58:05,243 --> 01:58:05,944
That's what I do.

891
01:58:07,525 --> 01:58:08,645
I want to finish strong.

892
01:58:09,586 --> 01:58:20,053
The only reason I'm needing to stay on is because there is a gap, not because I wouldn't have something to do if I wasn't in this role.

893
01:58:21,394 --> 01:58:22,955
As Mrs. DiBenedetto pointed out,

894
01:58:24,382 --> 01:58:26,343
I probably wouldn't work 25 hours a week.

895
01:58:26,383 --> 01:58:28,583
I'd probably work 80 hours a week or 60 hours a week.

896
01:58:30,384 --> 01:58:31,464
I'm going to work it anyway.

897
01:58:33,045 --> 01:58:44,369
But having the level of authority to do what needs to be done, to put things in place, to handle the collective bargaining that has to go on at this point in time is in your best interest.

898
01:58:45,889 --> 01:58:51,051
I can sit back, not do anything, but that means my successor

899
01:58:52,124 --> 01:58:53,505
is gonna have an awful lot to do.

900
01:58:54,145 --> 01:59:02,571
I would rather she comes in to a stable environment and have the opportunity to move her ideas and programs forward, and I will root for her.

901
01:59:03,492 --> 01:59:06,654
And I will work with her and give her as much support as she needs.

902
01:59:08,235 --> 01:59:20,844
But not to take care of the routine business of this school system, not to ensure that the partnership, some of the things that are on tonight's agenda, won't go forward, would be a disservice to you, to the community, and to her.

903
01:59:21,959 --> 01:59:26,743
So I respectfully request that you allow me to do what I have to do.

904
01:59:27,683 --> 01:59:29,545
I can assure you that you'll be involved.

905
01:59:30,225 --> 01:59:32,226
I can assure you that she will be involved.

906
01:59:32,747 --> 01:59:47,658
And I can assure you that any decision we make will be something that's collaborative and not an individual decision on my part, except for the routine kinds of things that have to happen day to day to keep the school system in place.

907
01:59:48,438 --> 01:59:50,380
So I appreciate your concerns.

908
01:59:51,349 --> 01:59:53,811
I want to assure you that that's my intent.

909
01:59:54,391 --> 01:59:55,892
Let's finish strong together.

910
01:59:56,073 --> 01:59:57,534
Let's have a good balanced budget.

911
01:59:58,134 --> 01:59:59,896
Let's put a budget together next year.

912
02:00:00,356 --> 02:00:10,163
That's going to be reflective of the things that you want to see and that will give our new superintendent an opportunity to innovate and do the things that will make the school system move forward.

913
02:00:10,183 --> 02:00:12,625
I appreciate you listening.

914
02:00:13,246 --> 02:00:13,986
Mr. Benedetto.

915
02:00:14,387 --> 02:00:15,327
Um, a few things.

916
02:00:15,708 --> 02:00:18,450
Number one, can we get a list of those positions that, um,

917
02:00:19,788 --> 02:00:25,791
are necessary to move forward so that—I know we asked for a list of retirements.

918
02:00:26,152 --> 02:00:47,063
It wasn't added to the back of the agenda for reports, so we had asked for a list of retirements or open positions for next year, so that would be helpful for us to know what interviews are happening, what's going on, because, like, I did not have any idea that those interviews were happening for the foreign language department at this point.

919
02:00:48,500 --> 02:00:50,201
That would be helpful as committee.

920
02:00:50,842 --> 02:00:58,208
Also, I'd like to, through you, to address the superintendent about the rumors that he plans on staying after June 30th.

921
02:00:58,288 --> 02:01:00,210
Is that your intention, Mr. Belson?

922
02:01:01,471 --> 02:01:01,851
Rumors?

923
02:01:03,312 --> 02:01:03,853
Reporting on rumors.

924
02:01:04,073 --> 02:01:07,255
The world is filled with rumortism, and that paralyzes everyone.

925
02:01:08,476 --> 02:01:11,599
The reality is that this is my community.

926
02:01:12,400 --> 02:01:15,442
If my community needs me to help, I'll be available.

927
02:01:15,902 --> 02:01:17,784
If my community doesn't need me to help,

928
02:01:18,610 --> 02:01:23,352
with or without compensation, of course, then that won't be there.

929
02:01:23,913 --> 02:01:25,273
I certainly won't be intrusive.

930
02:01:25,834 --> 02:01:31,457
But I've got to believe that a new superintendent is going to have a lot of questions once they get into the weeds.

931
02:01:33,258 --> 02:01:34,338
I'm a phone call away.

932
02:01:34,798 --> 02:01:35,759
I live down the street.

933
02:01:36,179 --> 02:01:39,521
And I'm more than happy to help, because this is my community.

934
02:01:40,341 --> 02:01:47,505
I've been superintendent and been in the school system longer than some people in this room have been alive.

935
02:01:48,327 --> 02:01:49,507
And this is my community.

936
02:01:50,248 --> 02:01:52,648
And I don't intend to reject my community.

937
02:01:53,048 --> 02:01:55,069
I don't intend to walk away from my community.

938
02:01:56,349 --> 02:02:04,892
But I don't expect, necessarily, that I would ever intrude on the prerogatives of my successor, on the school committee, or anyone else.

939
02:02:05,652 --> 02:02:06,572
But will I be helpful?

940
02:02:06,953 --> 02:02:07,553
Of course I will.

941
02:02:08,093 --> 02:02:11,594
I expect the school system to build on a very firm foundation.

942
02:02:12,314 --> 02:02:14,695
I expect the school system to progress and do well.

943
02:02:16,035 --> 02:02:23,569
So I'm not walking away, but I'm not intruding, and I'm available if I'm needed, and I will help wherever I can.

944
02:02:24,551 --> 02:02:24,931
Thank you.

945
02:02:26,073 --> 02:02:26,294
Ms.

946
02:02:26,314 --> 02:02:27,756
Van de Kloot, are you all set?

947
02:02:27,776 --> 02:02:27,917
No.

948
02:02:27,957 --> 02:02:28,077
Yep.

949
02:02:32,785 --> 02:02:38,253
I wanted to address a couple of the other points that we've sort of moved past, including the public records requests.

950
02:02:38,894 --> 02:02:47,326
It's important that the public, as being a public body, we are under all the laws that govern public requests.

951
02:02:47,947 --> 02:02:54,014
So we have a subcommittee of community relations, but I think this issue is sort of, I would like to have all the members present.

952
02:02:54,174 --> 02:03:03,685
So I'd like to make a motion that we have a committee of the whole meeting where we can address, go through all of the items that are important, including maybe having a mic stand in the back corner.

953
02:03:04,366 --> 02:03:07,550
So, you know, if there is a disabled person, we could just hand them the mic.

954
02:03:08,598 --> 02:03:12,180
or talking about public requests, where all these issues can be addressed.

955
02:03:12,360 --> 02:03:17,202
So like I said, to make a motion that we have a committee of the whole meeting to address all community engagements.

956
02:03:28,148 --> 02:03:33,569
But there is an individual at the school that is responsible and at the city that's responsible on our side as well.

957
02:03:33,589 --> 02:03:33,789
Yeah.

958
02:03:33,909 --> 02:03:39,430
I mean, I've made public requests and people have been very helpful, but it's unacceptable that emails bounce.

959
02:03:39,570 --> 02:03:44,871
But beyond that, there are other issues that we need to discuss about community engagement, community relation.

960
02:03:44,911 --> 02:03:46,091
I'd like to do that as a body.

961
02:03:46,411 --> 02:03:47,252
So that'd be my motion.

962
02:03:48,652 --> 02:03:49,252
Mr. Russo.

963
02:03:50,632 --> 02:03:54,333
Can you be clear as to what this meeting would do and be about?

964
02:03:54,828 --> 02:03:59,131
because we just had a conversation about an agenda item that was too vague for people.

965
02:03:59,672 --> 02:04:05,616
So once people read this agenda, they need to know whether they care and they're gonna go there.

966
02:04:06,096 --> 02:04:12,962
So this list, that's not anywhere good enough in my mind to vote for a meeting.

967
02:04:13,102 --> 02:04:20,347
Well, we can work with the chair and just sort of add items on the agenda, like we normally would when we have a meeting request.

968
02:04:21,048 --> 02:04:23,730
But basically, the broad outline would be

969
02:04:24,575 --> 02:04:27,959
how to discuss increasing community engagement on the school committee.

970
02:04:28,099 --> 02:04:30,241
That is exactly what this committee is about.

971
02:04:30,341 --> 02:04:32,123
So it really does belong with the committee.

972
02:04:33,124 --> 02:04:35,026
And we follow Robert's Rules of Order.

973
02:04:35,607 --> 02:04:38,450
And that's how we conduct our meetings here, these public meetings.

974
02:04:38,530 --> 02:04:39,971
It's all through Robert's Rules of Order.

975
02:04:41,072 --> 02:04:42,554
So that's the structure.

976
02:04:42,574 --> 02:04:46,138
And most formal committees adopt those standards.

977
02:04:48,541 --> 02:05:02,790
Can I just continue with what we also wanted to speak about, and something that I brought to your attention two years ago, and if it had been properly acted upon, we would not really be in the situation we're in right now.

978
02:05:03,731 --> 02:05:09,314
And two years ago, I did ask for a solid succession plan for the superintendent position.

979
02:05:10,055 --> 02:05:16,499
At the time, I do believe it was misconstrued, and people thought it was simply me saying about Mr. Bellison, but it wasn't.

980
02:05:16,519 --> 02:05:17,760
It could have been anybody sitting up there.

981
02:05:19,173 --> 02:05:23,475
And now we're poised to hire a new superintendent and there's still no plan.

982
02:05:24,536 --> 02:05:37,882
I felt at the time the request was definitely belittled and ultimately the plan that was presented included the scenario we're actually placed in now where there's an untimely or unexpected vacancy.

983
02:05:38,422 --> 02:05:42,944
And I just want to read exactly what the plan that was put forth actually says.

984
02:05:42,964 --> 02:05:47,586
It says, if the superintendent is unable to perform his duties for any reason,

985
02:05:48,306 --> 02:05:51,468
the deputy superintendent would become the interim superintendent.

986
02:05:52,849 --> 02:05:56,071
And then it goes on, but we wouldn't have to do a school committee search, obviously.

987
02:05:56,652 --> 02:06:04,757
The current school system administration is an experienced team that can handle transition and maintain operations for an extended period of time.

988
02:06:05,518 --> 02:06:14,404
We have an assistant superintendent, director of finance and administration, director of pupil services, director of building and grounds, as well as assistant principals,

989
02:06:15,194 --> 02:06:16,715
and departmental directors in place.

990
02:06:16,915 --> 02:06:19,237
Each would be able to carry out their essential functions.

991
02:06:20,578 --> 02:06:33,547
So with that being said, I'm not really sure why we're in a situation where we had to reverse a decision if this is what was put forth as the succession plan.

992
02:06:34,368 --> 02:06:44,255
If a proper plan had been in place, I don't think it could have been proposed or justified that your decision was reversed because of a lack of a succession plan.

993
02:06:45,535 --> 02:06:49,510
or that their people that were supposed to be taxed with the job were not available to do so.

994
02:06:51,757 --> 02:06:59,520
Ultimately, I think it just highlights what our community is feeling, that we're not being heard, that you're unwilling to actually be proactive.

995
02:06:59,560 --> 02:07:06,303
I mean, it was almost exactly two years ago that I asked for something to be done, and it's still not done.

996
02:07:06,523 --> 02:07:12,366
And now we're hiring a new superintendent, and we're still going to be at ground zero for what happens.

997
02:07:13,387 --> 02:07:15,508
I mean, we know now what a search involves.

998
02:07:16,695 --> 02:07:25,397
and we know what we want, but all of this needs to be in place before, I believe, before Mr. Belson leaves because you're obviously going to need his input.

999
02:07:26,217 --> 02:07:33,879
So what I'm asking for you tonight is an actual commitment and a date to have an actual solid succession plan.

1000
02:07:35,100 --> 02:07:39,961
Like I said, I believe Mr. Belson's input will be invaluable because there's just a lot of policy and

1001
02:07:40,658 --> 02:07:43,719
knowledge in his head that needs to be put in writing somewhere.

1002
02:07:44,620 --> 02:07:50,302
There's boilerplate plans that you can get that are fairly inexpensive that can sort of bring this along more quickly.

1003
02:07:51,242 --> 02:08:04,407
Ultimately it needs to be done now and it all just ties back to a better engagement of engaging your community and like I said, I know I was belittled and it's just a lack of respect for community participation.

1004
02:08:04,487 --> 02:08:09,089
It's the we know better, how dare you ask, we can handle it.

1005
02:08:10,248 --> 02:08:11,009
And that's unfortunate.

1006
02:08:12,330 --> 02:08:12,470
Ms.

1007
02:08:12,490 --> 02:08:13,351
Van de Kloot, you want to?

1008
02:08:14,111 --> 02:08:14,391
Sure.

1009
02:08:14,532 --> 02:08:16,573
So I just want to mention a couple of things.

1010
02:08:17,054 --> 02:08:37,130
I think that at the time, as we consider potential people who would fill, at least in my head, and I guess I have to speak for myself, clearly the assistant superintendent, as it is outlined exactly in that, would have been the person who would have been most likely to step into the role.

1011
02:08:38,331 --> 02:08:39,672
However, she's retiring.

1012
02:08:41,132 --> 02:08:41,853
The deputy.

1013
02:08:42,353 --> 02:08:43,434
The deputy superintendent.

1014
02:08:43,554 --> 02:08:44,255
Beverly Nelson.

1015
02:08:44,315 --> 02:08:45,036
Yeah.

1016
02:08:45,096 --> 02:08:45,796
So she's retiring.

1017
02:08:45,816 --> 02:08:46,837
You said the assistant, sorry.

1018
02:08:47,077 --> 02:08:47,358
Sorry.

1019
02:08:48,839 --> 02:08:49,600
She's retiring.

1020
02:08:50,320 --> 02:08:58,087
This is not the time to ask her in her career, as she winds down, for her to all of a sudden step into a very difficult role at the last minute.

1021
02:08:59,829 --> 02:09:02,811
Another potential would have been Dr. Perella.

1022
02:09:03,672 --> 02:09:07,035
Well, I don't think it's appropriate to then

1023
02:09:07,531 --> 02:09:13,032
ask the guy who you just didn't forward on to the finalists to step into the role.

1024
02:09:15,053 --> 02:09:15,733
Things change.

1025
02:09:16,713 --> 02:09:19,734
I don't think that the superintendent is able.

1026
02:09:20,754 --> 02:09:36,818
I believe that if, for example, had he taken ill, which thankfully he did not, but had he been taken ill, that people would have put any personal consideration aside because the loyalty to Mr. Belson is extreme amongst the people he's worked with.

1027
02:09:38,543 --> 02:09:46,888
So I don't think, Angela, that we did not think about the succession plan or that we belittled it.

1028
02:09:46,988 --> 02:09:56,112
I think we're going to have to look at it again as we do a new administration comes in to make sure that it all makes sense and look at our people, whatever.

1029
02:09:56,572 --> 02:09:59,934
But I don't think that was the intent of the school committee just to overlook it.

1030
02:09:59,994 --> 02:10:02,275
I think that they were extenuating circumstances.

1031
02:10:04,917 --> 02:10:05,537
In my mind,

1032
02:10:06,223 --> 02:10:17,549
there was only one thing that was important, and that is, what is in the best interest of the Medford Public Schools right now to ensure an effective transition to the next superintendent?

1033
02:10:19,230 --> 02:10:31,957
So, if it, in the, as we now make that transition to a new superintendent, I have no problem at all revisiting that policy, taking a look at it, but essentially, it's going to stand.

1034
02:10:32,537 --> 02:10:33,918
But, you know,

1035
02:10:35,548 --> 02:10:46,650
For me, the big question of who do we hear, school committee members heard from a lot of people, a lot of people.

1036
02:10:47,350 --> 02:10:58,792
And of course, there's been a very vocal segment of the community who's been very out there, who's been very upset with Mr. Belson, and there's been a whole lot of other people who've supported him.

1037
02:11:00,172 --> 02:11:02,793
I feel that we are elected

1038
02:11:04,300 --> 02:11:19,568
in the most difficult circumstances to keep our eye on the prize and be able to separate ourselves from all the different opinions we hear, no matter how difficult it is, and say, what is the most important thing going forward?

1039
02:11:21,189 --> 02:11:25,291
For me, it was to say, how do we make the best transition?

1040
02:11:25,451 --> 02:11:26,392
And in my mind,

1041
02:11:27,135 --> 02:11:39,000
It was at this point, given the circumstances that presented itself, it was to keep a experienced superintendent who had dedicated his life to Medford to move forward through the next eight weeks.

1042
02:11:41,121 --> 02:11:48,424
And I understand where your reasoning comes from, but with all due respect, you've known for months that the deputy was retiring.

1043
02:11:48,444 --> 02:11:56,227
You've known for months now that Mr. Belson was going to be retiring early, and there was never a mention, not that any of us have ever heard,

1044
02:11:57,051 --> 02:12:00,773
that there was not going to be a person to fill the position.

1045
02:12:01,393 --> 02:12:04,996
And I want to add, I do just feel like I need to add in this situation.

1046
02:12:05,136 --> 02:12:12,020
I was at the school committee meeting two years ago when Angela came up to the podium and asked very respectfully what the plan was.

1047
02:12:12,200 --> 02:12:13,981
And it was embarrassing.

1048
02:12:14,001 --> 02:12:18,963
And I think there was only probably one or two other people in the audience, but there were lots of people watching at home.

1049
02:12:19,023 --> 02:12:20,684
And it was embarrassing and humiliating.

1050
02:12:20,724 --> 02:12:23,606
And I felt terribly for Angela in that experience.

1051
02:12:23,626 --> 02:12:25,127
I remember writing an email to

1052
02:12:25,580 --> 02:12:27,061
the school committee after that meeting.

1053
02:12:27,421 --> 02:12:30,824
I actually befriended Angela as a result of that meeting.

1054
02:12:30,984 --> 02:12:34,687
It was entirely unfortunate and it was two years ago.

1055
02:12:34,707 --> 02:12:34,747
Ms.

1056
02:12:36,408 --> 02:12:36,808
Van de Kloot.

1057
02:12:37,609 --> 02:12:44,594
So I understand that that evening was unfortunate and did not play well.

1058
02:12:45,215 --> 02:12:54,542
I think that you meant the question now, you know, in a respectful way and that responded by saying, hey, this is the plan, okay?

1059
02:12:55,193 --> 02:12:58,134
There were extenuating circumstances which happened, okay?

1060
02:12:58,174 --> 02:13:04,376
There's another person who might have been a potential, but it wasn't a good time for her to take the role.

1061
02:13:08,658 --> 02:13:14,060
We need to look at the large picture.

1062
02:13:15,027 --> 02:13:16,547
and determine what was the best course.

1063
02:13:17,207 --> 02:13:19,428
And I understand there are a lot of people who disagree with us.

1064
02:13:20,328 --> 02:13:31,710
The only thing that I can say is that there are five people who are extraordinarily different in many, many ways, and yet five of us agreed that this was the best path.

1065
02:13:32,410 --> 02:13:35,090
Two did not, and I respect my colleagues for their decision.

1066
02:13:36,051 --> 02:13:41,532
But this is the way it operates in our public discourse of majority rules.

1067
02:13:41,912 --> 02:13:43,872
Five of us agreed that this was the best way.

1068
02:13:45,166 --> 02:13:58,977
In going forward, absolutely, especially if we have any changes in the way that we operate at central administration, we'll need to come up with a new succession plan in case we have, and hopefully we won't, hopefully we won't in the future.

1069
02:14:00,138 --> 02:14:08,405
We wish our new superintendent-elect a long and hopefully blissful reign as being superintendent.

1070
02:14:09,686 --> 02:14:10,247
Mr. Russo.

1071
02:14:12,092 --> 02:14:12,432
Thank you.

1072
02:14:13,472 --> 02:14:17,573
So I'm a software developer and have been for 20 years.

1073
02:14:19,194 --> 02:14:33,637
And one of the things that I learned probably a couple of years ago, quite surprisingly in an article, was about 80% of what I write for software, if I'm doing my job correctly, is exception handling, is handling the unexpected.

1074
02:14:34,738 --> 02:14:39,619
And the reason I bring that up is that as a body, when we write policies,

1075
02:14:41,428 --> 02:14:51,870
We have a choice, not sure it's always necessarily a conscious choice, but we have a choice about whether to make the policies robust to handle the unexpected.

1076
02:14:52,971 --> 02:15:06,273
And in software, where literally the entire environment is completely controlled by me, 80% of what I'm writing is to deal with the wild, crazy things that are happening.

1077
02:15:07,013 --> 02:15:09,614
But in a human endeavor, which is everything we're talking about,

1078
02:15:10,628 --> 02:15:17,691
it's probably 99.999% of the possibilities are not within the control of anybody in this room.

1079
02:15:18,571 --> 02:15:37,800
And my point is just that when we write a policy, if we try to write policies that are truly robust and can handle endless scenarios, and the people in this room could write for months and never finish coming up with scenarios for how any policy probably won't work.

1080
02:15:39,177 --> 02:15:56,426
So we can either focus on a single policy for weeks and months and probably years and still never get it right, or we can rely on the fact that we're going to come together when it doesn't work right and then deal with that, maybe make a tweak to the policy and move forward.

1081
02:15:57,206 --> 02:16:00,168
And in my mind, there is just not the bandwidth.

1082
02:16:01,685 --> 02:16:27,377
I don't just mean my personal time, but I mean this meeting to get our policies perfect, or even close to perfect, because that's not a reality, even in situations like my job, where I am in control in a way that is not a reality in the human experience.

1083
02:16:27,844 --> 02:16:35,508
So, you know, do I think it's better to have a one or two page policy that has holes you can drive a truck through if the building burns down?

1084
02:16:36,408 --> 02:16:45,153
Or if, you know, all the superintendent and deputy and everybody with a superintendent license goes to a conference and, you know, they shut down the airlines.

1085
02:16:45,473 --> 02:16:51,976
I mean, we could go on and on for how the policy could be better and more robust.

1086
02:16:53,497 --> 02:16:56,879
But then the simplest of policies would be a book.

1087
02:16:57,990 --> 02:17:02,893
that nobody will read, nobody will know what it says, and you won't be able to use it when you actually need it.

1088
02:17:03,554 --> 02:17:11,499
So I want our policies to be as simple as they can be without, too simple.

1089
02:17:12,179 --> 02:17:20,165
Like, you know, a succession plan that said if we needed a new superintendent for an unfortunate reason was we'd get a new superintendent.

1090
02:17:20,265 --> 02:17:22,706
Like, that's obviously too simple.

1091
02:17:23,087 --> 02:17:24,968
But the number of people in our district that have

1092
02:17:25,489 --> 02:17:33,195
either a superintendent license, or we could use the MASS to get an emergency superintendent.

1093
02:17:33,636 --> 02:17:34,857
I mean, that's good enough for me.

1094
02:17:35,097 --> 02:17:46,226
One pager's plenty, but we can't cover all the scenarios, and so... I definitely don't want all scenarios covered, but I would like the major scenario of...

1095
02:17:47,520 --> 02:17:52,284
If position one cannot be filled, who's going to take control?

1096
02:17:52,784 --> 02:18:04,913
Because right now, this is what there is, and then you're saying tonight that, well, it doesn't really matter because it's not in the deputy or even the assistant superintendent's contracts that they would step up.

1097
02:18:05,733 --> 02:18:10,377
So this, what is on file as the succession plan, is wrong.

1098
02:18:11,437 --> 02:18:12,818
So it can be improved, I agree.

1099
02:18:13,179 --> 02:18:14,039
Or just start over.

1100
02:18:16,088 --> 02:18:16,208
Ms.

1101
02:18:16,228 --> 02:18:19,690
Stone, we have a full agenda as well that we need to get on.

1102
02:18:20,091 --> 02:18:34,379
I just want to say a parent did email the next day and say, you definitely need to put in the new deputy superintendent's contract that they will step in so that we have to add that because that isn't currently in the contract.

1103
02:18:34,419 --> 02:18:42,624
So that doesn't work, which I was a shame on me that I didn't read their contract to know that they did not have to be

1104
02:18:43,974 --> 02:18:47,216
are forced into taking that superintendent's job.

1105
02:18:48,557 --> 02:18:54,420
So that's, we can add that to make sure the next deputy superintendent is their job.

1106
02:18:55,940 --> 02:18:57,701
Final comment, Mr. Benedetto?

1107
02:18:57,721 --> 02:19:02,384
To be clear and transparent, thank you.

1108
02:19:03,104 --> 02:19:03,784
It's been a long night.

1109
02:19:04,625 --> 02:19:07,206
I just want you to know, this didn't come out at that meeting.

1110
02:19:07,626 --> 02:19:07,986
No, it didn't.

1111
02:19:08,066 --> 02:19:10,388
We didn't pull out this paperwork and read the policy.

1112
02:19:11,758 --> 02:19:18,562
Because if we had, we would have went down to the assistant superintendent when the deputy said that she wasn't able to take that position.

1113
02:19:19,903 --> 02:19:24,486
I didn't bring it forward because I was floored by what was being proposed to me at the time.

1114
02:19:24,866 --> 02:19:28,068
It didn't enter my mind until someone asked me for a copy of this.

1115
02:19:28,489 --> 02:19:31,711
And I went, oh my gosh, I can't believe I didn't bring this forward.

1116
02:19:31,971 --> 02:19:35,033
And our new members probably have never seen this or read this.

1117
02:19:35,673 --> 02:19:37,675
So yeah, you're right.

1118
02:19:38,135 --> 02:19:39,416
This should have been implemented.

1119
02:19:39,776 --> 02:19:40,917
I'm surprised it wasn't.

1120
02:19:41,988 --> 02:19:49,553
I would have loved to seen this implemented because I know Mr. Belson wouldn't have left us hanging and he would still be there for vital information.

1121
02:19:49,613 --> 02:19:50,974
And I made that point at that night.

1122
02:19:51,334 --> 02:19:54,576
So I'm being transparent about what I did and what I didn't do.

1123
02:19:54,836 --> 02:19:55,877
I didn't bring this forward.

1124
02:19:55,977 --> 02:19:57,398
I didn't think about this item.

1125
02:19:57,938 --> 02:19:59,219
This should have been implemented.

1126
02:19:59,359 --> 02:20:10,066
This is our policy that we voted on when you brought it forward, when I left you hanging that night, and I apologize for, because I should have said something that evening as well.

1127
02:20:10,520 --> 02:20:14,261
So I own what I've done, and I'm going to try to do better.

1128
02:20:14,841 --> 02:20:17,422
So, you know, that's all I can do.

1129
02:20:18,582 --> 02:20:26,484
And we need to make sure that, you know, we have people like you reminding us, hey, we did this, because we can't remember everything.

1130
02:20:27,064 --> 02:20:27,465
Thank you.

1131
02:20:27,565 --> 02:20:30,485
And thank you for everyone out there tonight that's still here.

1132
02:20:30,605 --> 02:20:35,807
And for folks that are watching at home, we really want to encourage you to remember to come to the school committee meetings.

1133
02:20:36,567 --> 02:20:37,507
Let your voice be heard.

1134
02:20:37,547 --> 02:20:39,488
Your voice matters, and your vote matters.

1135
02:20:39,568 --> 02:20:39,888
Thank you.

1136
02:20:40,248 --> 02:20:41,008
Thank you very much.

1137
02:20:42,909 --> 02:20:47,090
Next item up, recommendation to reject school choice for school year 2018-19.

1138
02:20:47,170 --> 02:20:50,991
We have a paper.

1139
02:20:51,071 --> 02:20:53,951
Traditionally, we have rejected school choice in this community.

1140
02:20:54,231 --> 02:20:56,932
Is there a motion on the floor to reject school choice?

1141
02:20:57,392 --> 02:21:00,473
Mr. Russo, seconded by Ms.

1142
02:21:00,493 --> 02:21:01,073
Vander Kloof.

1143
02:21:01,453 --> 02:21:02,413
Roll call vote, please.

1144
02:21:09,492 --> 02:21:16,677
quick summary is that under school choice people can

1145
02:21:17,430 --> 02:21:21,671
come to our school district for a very low amount of money if we have open seats.

1146
02:21:22,531 --> 02:21:32,494
And the cost that we would receive or the compensation received is not worth it to us, and we would have to educate people that would take seats from other people.

1147
02:21:32,894 --> 02:21:35,034
It just doesn't work under the current rule.

1148
02:21:35,355 --> 02:21:40,836
If you're a school system that has such open seats and you have no revenue coming in, maybe it makes sense.

1149
02:21:40,876 --> 02:21:41,856
That's not our situation.

1150
02:21:43,037 --> 02:21:44,777
We have to notify the state by a certain date.

1151
02:21:45,645 --> 02:21:46,605
Roll call vote, Ms.

1152
02:21:46,645 --> 02:21:48,446
Kretz, to reject school choice.

1153
02:21:50,327 --> 02:21:50,607
Yes.

1154
02:21:50,627 --> 02:21:53,969
I was just waiting for the wording.

1155
02:21:59,051 --> 02:22:01,812
Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, motion passes.

1156
02:22:03,893 --> 02:22:08,395
Report on middle school, school year 18-19 enrollment and selection.

1157
02:22:11,477 --> 02:22:11,617
Ms.

1158
02:22:11,637 --> 02:22:11,997
Nelson.

1159
02:22:13,678 --> 02:22:14,118
Good evening.

1160
02:22:15,547 --> 02:22:21,789
From the report, you can see a little bit of the history of what we've been doing over the past several years.

1161
02:22:22,789 --> 02:22:37,053
Since the new middle schools opened in 2001, parents of students in grade 5 have been allowed to choose the middle school that they would like their child to attend, starting in 6th grade.

1162
02:22:37,553 --> 02:22:42,134
This system worked very well for a number of years, back and forth a little bit, sometimes the McGlynn

1163
02:22:42,696 --> 02:22:51,959
had more kids, sometimes the Andrews went back and forth, until this year, when we really had a big difference in enrollment.

1164
02:22:52,559 --> 02:22:59,842
And as you know, this past school year, we had several more fifth graders opting to go to the Andrews.

1165
02:23:00,482 --> 02:23:06,444
In total, that was 43, which is more than one class, almost two classes of youngsters.

1166
02:23:07,404 --> 02:23:08,865
So as we began to

1167
02:23:10,692 --> 02:23:16,856
think about moving forward and how we were going to handle the choice situation.

1168
02:23:17,737 --> 02:23:22,200
With your approval, we put the following items in place for this year.

1169
02:23:22,220 --> 02:23:23,261
We made some changes.

1170
02:23:23,941 --> 02:23:31,246
I will say, too, that the numbers of the Andrews of the students in grade six going to grade seven appears to be constant.

1171
02:23:31,266 --> 02:23:35,629
So they're still going to have that larger group in moving into grade seven.

1172
02:23:35,649 --> 02:23:38,351
There doesn't seem to be any movement out at this point.

1173
02:23:39,805 --> 02:23:49,369
Again, this year we decided to do things differently because there had been some things that we felt could be improved upon, one of which was the returning of the choice forms.

1174
02:23:50,430 --> 02:23:53,171
Up until this year, parents had options.

1175
02:23:53,291 --> 02:24:00,894
They could return them to the school, they could return them to the parent center in person, they could return them to the parent center by mail.

1176
02:24:02,135 --> 02:24:08,037
And this led to some confusion because there were deadlines and people felt that they truly had sent it in by the deadline,

1177
02:24:08,505 --> 02:24:09,325
but it didn't arrive.

1178
02:24:09,385 --> 02:24:15,548
So there were all kinds, whenever you have choice of how you do something, there always leaves room for issues.

1179
02:24:15,948 --> 02:24:18,869
So we decided to have a process that was uniform.

1180
02:24:19,189 --> 02:24:25,492
And we said this year, all forms would be returned to the school where the child was going to school.

1181
02:24:25,872 --> 02:24:29,894
And that's worked very well because we could track all the forms as they came in.

1182
02:24:30,514 --> 02:24:35,936
We also wanted parents to have verification that they had actually turned their form in.

1183
02:24:36,406 --> 02:24:42,851
So every school, in their own way, gave the parent a number or a form that said that the form was passed.

1184
02:24:42,871 --> 02:24:47,435
And so nobody could say, gee, I sent it in, but it must have gone somewhere else.

1185
02:24:47,835 --> 02:24:52,098
So again, we felt that process, by tightening up that, that was very helpful.

1186
02:24:53,119 --> 02:25:01,686
The second thing that we made changes on is that we decided that the open houses, we'd make them more consistent in the presentation.

1187
02:25:02,226 --> 02:25:03,948
And Dr. Riccadeli and I, as you know,

1188
02:25:04,874 --> 02:25:12,499
And we basically facilitated the presentation for the McGlynn, which was first, and the Andrews, which was second.

1189
02:25:13,200 --> 02:25:18,523
And again, we had the principals there, because we don't want them to be hidden, and we had the tours of the buildings.

1190
02:25:19,063 --> 02:25:33,573
But we gave a presentation to really emphasize to parents that the education opportunities at both schools were equal, and that students were going to get an education, the same education, curriculum-wise, in either school.

1191
02:25:34,273 --> 02:25:43,037
So we felt that was an improvement, and we asked parents to return forms to the schools, their child's elementary school, by April 2nd.

1192
02:25:43,898 --> 02:25:44,278
All right?

1193
02:25:45,378 --> 02:25:50,581
And then again, we also put in place that there would be choice.

1194
02:25:50,601 --> 02:25:53,182
There was almost like two steps to the process.

1195
02:25:53,202 --> 02:26:03,187
There would be choice, but if the choice resulted in imbalance, a large imbalance, the committee voted that they would have a partial lottery, so to even out the numbers.

1196
02:26:03,990 --> 02:26:15,976
And again, we were hoping that the choice, the numbers would be even, but as you can see from the data that I gave you at the second sheet, they're not.

1197
02:26:16,016 --> 02:26:28,123
In fact, in reviewing some of the items with special education today with Joan Bowen, we actually have two more students that need to be placed at the Andrews.

1198
02:26:28,223 --> 02:26:30,284
So it brings it to a total of

1199
02:26:30,940 --> 02:26:32,782
Entering sixth grade is at the Andrews, 176.

1200
02:26:33,202 --> 02:26:36,645
Entering students at the McGlynn is 118.

1201
02:26:38,006 --> 02:26:40,228
So we're looking to the committee for next steps.

1202
02:26:41,208 --> 02:26:46,012
Parents are waiting to hear definitely what school the children will be attending.

1203
02:26:46,553 --> 02:26:49,575
And obviously, principals are eager to start scheduling.

1204
02:26:49,615 --> 02:26:53,418
And you really can't start the scheduling process until you have numbers.

1205
02:26:54,019 --> 02:26:59,263
So again, moving forward, we, again, need some guidance on

1206
02:26:59,790 --> 02:27:01,270
how to conduct this partial lottery.

1207
02:27:01,310 --> 02:27:13,473
You can see the different schools where the imbalance is the greatest, and we have to go from there, and I think we probably need to give it some thought, but not too long, because people are eager to move forward.

1208
02:27:16,573 --> 02:27:17,533
Mr. Rousseau, sorry.

1209
02:27:19,474 --> 02:27:20,094
Thank you, Ms.

1210
02:27:20,114 --> 02:27:22,294
Nelson.

1211
02:27:22,794 --> 02:27:25,295
Some parents did not submit a form back.

1212
02:27:26,375 --> 02:27:26,835
Very few.

1213
02:27:27,785 --> 02:27:36,031
Were there efforts to contact those families to find out what their preferences were?

1214
02:27:37,132 --> 02:27:43,077
There were very few that didn't return them, and I'm not quite sure what individual principals did.

1215
02:27:43,157 --> 02:27:46,139
I can find out, again, at their age, from school to school.

1216
02:27:46,720 --> 02:27:54,185
But again, what we did is we found that, again, as you can see, that there were some that had no requests.

1217
02:27:56,574 --> 02:28:03,096
basically the programs like the EL students did not have choice because they do have to go to the McGlynn, so there were things like that.

1218
02:28:03,496 --> 02:28:12,839
And again, with Joan Bowen today, we were able to make sure we had the students who needed to be placed in certain special education programs in the appropriate building.

1219
02:28:16,395 --> 02:28:19,257
spent entirely too many hours on these numbers this weekend.

1220
02:28:20,738 --> 02:28:23,721
Thank you for getting this to us as early as possible.

1221
02:28:24,662 --> 02:28:34,109
You know, reviewing this was not really very fun, because the imbalance was so pronounced.

1222
02:28:34,769 --> 02:28:45,097
And I just, you know, when I was trying to figure out how we would handle this, other than the fact that we would have to have a partial lottery, you know, I was trying to figure out, like, what are the principles that I feel are important,

1223
02:28:46,363 --> 02:28:53,365
The basic principle that I felt was the only one that I could stand on was that each school sends half their kids to each middle school.

1224
02:28:54,305 --> 02:29:13,929
And because the selection between the schools from the individual elementary schools is very pronounced in a couple of the schools, that means that a couple of the elementary schools will have a much greater amount of getting their non-preferred school.

1225
02:29:14,450 --> 02:29:15,790
And I just want to make sure that

1226
02:29:18,431 --> 02:29:24,617
So I've never had any doubt that this process is perfectly fair and there's no shenanigans going on.

1227
02:29:25,078 --> 02:29:39,973
But for this year in particular, I really think it's important that when the randomization is happening, that there is at least one school committee member present, that the public is free to show up if they want.

1228
02:29:40,533 --> 02:29:46,035
and that this randomization is done live with people present, whether it's recorded or not.

1229
02:29:46,495 --> 02:29:57,020
Because it's randomized, they go, you're the brother of that person, that's why you got to go to Andrews or whatever school.

1230
02:29:57,620 --> 02:30:01,542
And those things are gonna happen, but not because of that.

1231
02:30:02,022 --> 02:30:09,845
And I've never felt that I had concerns that this stuff wasn't being done honestly, but I just feel like

1232
02:30:10,494 --> 02:30:16,437
there's no reason we can't shut that down by saying, look, here's the video, you can show it if you want.

1233
02:30:19,219 --> 02:30:30,706
I realize there's some planning involved in that, but I just think it's worth it, because there's gonna be a lot of unhappy parents, at least, maybe students too.

1234
02:30:31,493 --> 02:30:31,913
I agree.

1235
02:30:31,993 --> 02:30:32,794
This is not easy.

1236
02:30:33,354 --> 02:30:36,875
You know, people have had choice and I think we had our fingers crossed.

1237
02:30:37,355 --> 02:30:42,657
You know, we made it clear to parents, we didn't want to say you have choice and then turn around and do something very different.

1238
02:30:42,677 --> 02:30:50,200
We made it clear in the letter that went to them that, you know what, we're going to try the choice method, but if it doesn't work, we're going to have to go to something else.

1239
02:30:50,220 --> 02:30:51,441
So I think we've warned parents.

1240
02:30:51,841 --> 02:30:57,403
So we're not, I would not advise doing something, a third option, but certainly people,

1241
02:30:58,372 --> 02:31:08,696
If we had to go to the lottery, people want it to be fair, and I think what you're saying in terms of people seeing that it's a fair process would be the way to go.

1242
02:31:08,796 --> 02:31:18,520
But this is the committee's decision, and like I said, I mean, you might want to give it some thought, but people are kind of calling up and saying, what am I going to know?

1243
02:31:18,741 --> 02:31:21,542
And the principals, too, need to begin to schedule buildings.

1244
02:31:22,162 --> 02:31:22,322
Ms.

1245
02:31:22,342 --> 02:31:22,782
Van de Kloot.

1246
02:31:23,703 --> 02:31:25,603
So I just have a couple of thoughts on this.

1247
02:31:28,084 --> 02:31:43,147
If, I'm reflecting back on the presentation by our superintendent elect and what Dr. Eduard Vincent suggested was that we first appeal to people.

1248
02:31:43,708 --> 02:31:54,190
Now, I don't think we can appeal to people and ask them if they might consider moving their child to the McGlynn unless we have.

1249
02:31:58,662 --> 02:32:05,169
And so I would want to see us move on, I understand there might be some negotiations involved.

1250
02:32:05,209 --> 02:32:11,357
I don't know whether the person who's there is ready to want that position.

1251
02:32:13,235 --> 02:32:26,683
Obviously, he's been met with a lot of favoritism, and I think that if it was clear who the principal was, when we did this, it was, oh, there's no principal, while the other schools had a principal.

1252
02:32:26,943 --> 02:32:32,006
I mean, I wouldn't have selected my school if, well, here there's no principal.

1253
02:32:33,027 --> 02:32:34,728
So the first thing we have to do,

1254
02:32:35,257 --> 02:32:37,278
is move on that appointment.

1255
02:32:37,338 --> 02:32:38,418
That would be my number one.

1256
02:32:38,979 --> 02:32:51,204
The second is, the most obvious is that we have a group of students, there's 21 students at the McGlynn, and many of their peers already traditionally stay at the McGlynn.

1257
02:32:51,744 --> 02:32:53,045
Now maybe not all 21 would go.

1258
02:32:54,278 --> 02:33:05,606
but certainly if there's, because of the proximity, that principal who we put into place might be able to make a bond with the kids and family.

1259
02:33:05,706 --> 02:33:16,414
So, you know, I'm just wondering whether it isn't worth putting a little bit of effort into saying it's not going to be quite equal, there'll be some imbalance that we're going to live with this year.

1260
02:33:18,436 --> 02:33:19,917
But over time,

1261
02:33:20,577 --> 02:33:22,858
And Mr. Martelloni did this very well.

1262
02:33:23,178 --> 02:33:27,400
He showed us in his graphs how it had changed.

1263
02:33:27,840 --> 02:33:31,782
We put a strong principle into the McGlynn, we're going to see a change.

1264
02:33:33,042 --> 02:33:43,746
So I think that, and down the road, we might want to do something completely different like Dr. Maurice floated to us as an idea out of the box.

1265
02:33:44,146 --> 02:33:47,968
But I definitely think that we should at least send out letters

1266
02:33:49,037 --> 02:33:50,897
To parents we need to put a principal in place.

1267
02:33:51,458 --> 02:33:59,979
We need to have and we need to at least target Maybe the McGlynn elementary students saying would you be willing now again?

1268
02:34:00,019 --> 02:34:10,341
There may be some parents who aren't for particular reasons that their kid needs to change But then maybe on the other hand someone's gonna be here who the principal is and the rest of the group and they're gonna say Hey, I kind of like him for my kid.

1269
02:34:10,381 --> 02:34:13,762
He would be a good match So that would be my first thought

1270
02:34:15,927 --> 02:34:17,888
So let me add a couple of other dimensions to this thing.

1271
02:34:17,928 --> 02:34:26,832
If we take the next two weeks, remember the principal, who we are all talking about a little bit, needs to think about it in terms of his own personal needs.

1272
02:34:26,892 --> 02:34:31,714
I mean, he's obviously a person who has to weigh all his situations.

1273
02:34:31,774 --> 02:34:32,915
But we've had discussions.

1274
02:34:32,995 --> 02:34:36,576
And I think over the next several days, we'll get an answer.

1275
02:34:36,696 --> 02:34:37,077
That's one.

1276
02:34:38,417 --> 02:34:44,600
Second piece is that we haven't done the numbers, but I have, is that the class size is at the McGlynn right now.

1277
02:34:45,873 --> 02:34:51,976
If you were to go to class size, you're probably like 14, 15 in the class size, whereas at the Andrews, it's closer to 20.

1278
02:34:53,116 --> 02:35:00,899
So maybe smaller class size is another attractive feature that's there for some people, not everybody.

1279
02:35:01,940 --> 02:35:13,204
And thirdly, you know, if people would like to consider staying there with their friends and they go in a cohort, as Paul mentioned, you know, and if their friends go with them, because we've heard that before, that might do it.

1280
02:35:13,745 --> 02:35:14,445
So a suggestion.

1281
02:35:15,547 --> 02:35:17,908
Over the next two weeks, we do what we have to do.

1282
02:35:18,768 --> 02:35:19,948
We talk to people.

1283
02:35:20,788 --> 02:35:22,929
We go over the principalship.

1284
02:35:23,509 --> 02:35:24,569
We make a serious effort.

1285
02:35:25,189 --> 02:35:28,670
But at the end of two weeks, when we come back on the 21st, you've got to act.

1286
02:35:29,210 --> 02:35:31,711
You've got to act, because we've got to get in the business of doing business.

1287
02:35:31,751 --> 02:35:33,311
There's things to be done.

1288
02:35:33,951 --> 02:35:36,012
And sometimes hard decisions have to be made.

1289
02:35:36,432 --> 02:35:39,573
Now, we don't need a one for one at the schools.

1290
02:35:39,613 --> 02:35:40,873
They don't have to be exactly even.

1291
02:35:42,093 --> 02:35:43,114
But they have to be close enough.

1292
02:35:45,128 --> 02:35:45,688
within 15, 20 kids.

1293
02:35:45,748 --> 02:35:49,190
I mean, that's a reasonable differential.

1294
02:35:50,411 --> 02:35:50,511
Okay?

1295
02:35:51,491 --> 02:35:51,751
Thank you.

1296
02:35:52,812 --> 02:35:53,492
Mr. Ruggiero.

1297
02:35:53,973 --> 02:35:55,073
So I just want to make this clear.

1298
02:35:55,093 --> 02:35:56,674
Right now, we have a disparity of 29 children.

1299
02:35:56,714 --> 02:35:57,414
So if 29 of the 100- 58.

1300
02:35:57,454 --> 02:35:59,816
No, 29 of the 176 went to the McGlynn, it would be equal.

1301
02:35:59,876 --> 02:36:00,236
Is that correct?

1302
02:36:00,256 --> 02:36:00,676
That's my math.

1303
02:36:00,696 --> 02:36:00,916
If we were

1304
02:36:09,335 --> 02:36:12,056
Because we subtract 29, add 29, it works out, okay.

1305
02:36:12,076 --> 02:36:13,016
Okay, I believe you.

1306
02:36:13,156 --> 02:36:16,798
So I'm just trying to, once again, trying to get the 15 to 20.

1307
02:36:17,838 --> 02:36:21,839
So if we're in a buffer of 15, that would work.

1308
02:36:22,560 --> 02:36:23,800
So one school has... Right.

1309
02:36:24,160 --> 02:36:36,425
We've also asked Mrs. Guarino to identify the students, the 21 students who opted to go to the Andrews, and perhaps they may reconsider, again, to go back to the McGlynn, and that would be 21.

1310
02:36:37,663 --> 02:36:39,084
additional that would move back into the McGlynn.

1311
02:36:39,124 --> 02:36:41,666
So we need to convince 14 students, basically.

1312
02:36:43,387 --> 02:36:53,214
Yep, 14 on the, that would be the most, if we can convince 14 students, are there any incentives that we can offer other than low class size that we can offer to those 14 students?

1313
02:36:53,855 --> 02:36:56,617
Like is it possible we could identify the cohorts?

1314
02:36:56,977 --> 02:37:04,703
So these are 10 kids that just definitely wanna be together, they're buddies, and so we're gonna make sure that they go over and we can get to our 14.

1315
02:37:06,747 --> 02:37:08,868
Well, we have a meeting with principals tomorrow.

1316
02:37:08,908 --> 02:37:11,728
I know the elementary principals come in with Diane at 930.

1317
02:37:11,788 --> 02:37:16,869
We can maybe put something out to them and encourage them maybe to go back.

1318
02:37:17,070 --> 02:37:21,551
I do think that the leadership of the school would make a difference.

1319
02:37:21,951 --> 02:37:26,472
We have talked to Mr. Tucci, but I have to give him time to make his decisions.

1320
02:37:26,492 --> 02:37:27,612
It's a big decision for him.

1321
02:37:28,172 --> 02:37:31,313
I think if he were to be appointed that we'd see

1322
02:37:32,667 --> 02:37:34,088
an influx of people back in.

1323
02:37:34,589 --> 02:37:36,910
But we have to kind of wait that out a little bit.

1324
02:37:38,051 --> 02:37:39,051
So one more thing.

1325
02:37:40,072 --> 02:37:42,293
Tonight you saw some teachers come in from Lumbergoyne.

1326
02:37:43,834 --> 02:37:47,316
As we said before, and as I think we all agree, there's some terrific people there.

1327
02:37:48,037 --> 02:37:56,562
It may be that we send a few emissaries over from Glen Middle to talk to some of the elementary school kids, and maybe they can talk about their programs a little bit.

1328
02:37:56,602 --> 02:37:59,264
Talk about some of the things they'd like to do, and maybe that's a piece too.

1329
02:38:00,422 --> 02:38:02,442
So there's four or five things we can do.

1330
02:38:03,643 --> 02:38:06,843
It's not a guarantee, but it's worth a shot.

1331
02:38:08,184 --> 02:38:12,865
You just have to be prepared that some people will say no and some people will say yes.

1332
02:38:13,805 --> 02:38:19,246
Another issue that we've got to deal with is not specifically this one, but it's an issue, and that's the seventh grade.

1333
02:38:20,526 --> 02:38:29,548
You have emailed me and other people have emailed me ad nauseam, no offense, about a person here and a person there.

1334
02:38:30,477 --> 02:38:33,820
There are 12 people who wanted that shift.

1335
02:38:34,420 --> 02:38:40,865
If we do it for one, you know, out of turn, it's going to send some other people unhappy.

1336
02:38:40,945 --> 02:38:41,906
So we've got to look at that.

1337
02:38:41,946 --> 02:38:45,208
Let's see what the numbers actually present in the seventh grade.

1338
02:38:45,728 --> 02:38:47,890
We'll get a better sense of what the seventh grade is like.

1339
02:38:47,950 --> 02:38:50,992
Maybe with the new principal, that would be a positive too.

1340
02:38:51,633 --> 02:38:57,577
But before we start taking any one person out of line, I think that's something else we need to be careful about.

1341
02:39:03,887 --> 02:39:08,388
My question, so I just want to know when is the deadline we have to decide exactly on the lottery?

1342
02:39:09,289 --> 02:39:12,469
I would say the 21st we should be ready to make a decision.

1343
02:39:13,189 --> 02:39:15,870
We should, you know, give you an idea towards the end of that week.

1344
02:39:16,250 --> 02:39:16,410
Okay.

1345
02:39:16,770 --> 02:39:19,251
You know, that it's either happening or it's not happening.

1346
02:39:20,971 --> 02:39:21,611
Mr. Russo.

1347
02:39:22,991 --> 02:39:24,692
I would just like to speak to the issue of the 21.

1348
02:39:26,088 --> 02:39:34,673
McGlynn Elementary students that have selected the Andrews, I am actually quite uncomfortable with them even being contacted to see if they would switch.

1349
02:39:35,333 --> 02:39:42,217
The goal of 50% of the kids from each school is an incredibly important one we should be working towards.

1350
02:39:42,517 --> 02:39:54,243
And we should be thankful for the 66 kids that selected the McGlynn for reducing the pressure that we're currently experiencing because if the McGlynn had done a selection very similar to the other schools,

1351
02:39:54,656 --> 02:39:56,637
this whole mess would be a much bigger mess.

1352
02:39:57,778 --> 02:40:07,803
So I'm not really thrilled that there's a greater number of students from the McGlynn that are going to stay in the McGlynn, but I sort of thank them anyways.

1353
02:40:09,104 --> 02:40:23,151
But the 21 kids from the McGlynn that have selected the Andrews, to me, are not the families that should be at all looked at for finding more seats.

1354
02:40:25,165 --> 02:40:36,111
And at the Columbus, as Mr. Belson alluded to, I know some families at the Columbus who got together, talked to each other, and decided, look, we want to be together.

1355
02:40:37,712 --> 02:40:41,274
And if we all select the Andrews, who knows?

1356
02:40:42,194 --> 02:40:45,996
And they decided after going to the open houses, look, these schools are both great.

1357
02:40:46,657 --> 02:40:51,219
And they decided to take the safe bet based on what was going on at the time.

1358
02:40:51,724 --> 02:40:55,667
and they selected, as a group, to choose the McGlynn.

1359
02:40:55,927 --> 02:40:59,390
And they all got the McGlynn, of course, and they're super happy.

1360
02:40:59,770 --> 02:41:20,265
So I would just recommend to the families that have selected the Andrews, that the Roberts, Columbus, and the Brooks, that if you have even thought about this, talk to your friends, your kids' friends, which is, you know, and start this conversation right away.

1361
02:41:20,890 --> 02:41:24,992
and then raise your hand right away so we can get this stuff going earlier.

1362
02:41:25,472 --> 02:41:30,534
Because if we can get the numbers down low enough where we don't even need a lottery, that would be great.

1363
02:41:30,574 --> 02:41:39,858
But also, wouldn't it be nice if you have a child with four friends who have never been separated since preschool, and you want them to go together to one school.

1364
02:41:40,278 --> 02:41:48,922
If you don't decide to go to the McGlynn together, and you go into the lottery, one of your children, maybe yours, is going to be going to the McGlynn

1365
02:41:49,372 --> 02:41:51,212
And the other three are staying at the Andrews.

1366
02:41:51,632 --> 02:41:52,893
And yeah, that is awful.

1367
02:41:53,733 --> 02:41:57,534
But that's not really one of our choices to not do that.

1368
02:41:57,794 --> 02:42:00,074
So families need to think about that.

1369
02:42:00,634 --> 02:42:02,375
Really think about that.

1370
02:42:03,135 --> 02:42:03,295
Ms.

1371
02:42:03,355 --> 02:42:05,615
Nelson, do we know if any PTO meetings are coming up?

1372
02:42:07,836 --> 02:42:08,396
The elementaries?

1373
02:42:09,556 --> 02:42:10,156
We had one tonight.

1374
02:42:10,516 --> 02:42:10,976
It's tonight.

1375
02:42:12,096 --> 02:42:12,556
Yeah, that's right.

1376
02:42:12,636 --> 02:42:15,237
But again, we do have the principals in tomorrow morning.

1377
02:42:16,120 --> 02:42:23,407
We will bring it up with them and maybe we can get a little more, but it's like not huge numbers.

1378
02:42:23,427 --> 02:42:29,473
We don't have to move 50 kids, 60 kids, but just enough to make it a little bit more equitable.

1379
02:42:30,353 --> 02:42:30,514
Ms.

1380
02:42:30,554 --> 02:42:30,954
Mustone.

1381
02:42:31,795 --> 02:42:37,240
Back in January when our meeting was in the media studio in the McGlynn

1382
02:42:38,130 --> 02:42:41,051
teachers spoke about their improvement plan.

1383
02:42:41,831 --> 02:42:50,414
Someone mentioned almost, I don't want to call it gifted and talented because that's not what they called it, but it was, does this sound familiar to you?

1384
02:42:51,255 --> 02:42:54,376
And they were saying that could be a way to attract that.

1385
02:42:54,456 --> 02:43:03,499
If you spoke to the four elementary school principals and said maybe you could, kids who want to be pushed more or kids whose parents want to push them more, maybe

1386
02:43:03,983 --> 02:43:06,344
it was talked about having a program at the McGlynn.

1387
02:43:06,684 --> 02:43:08,185
Does that sound familiar to anyone else?

1388
02:43:08,765 --> 02:43:11,147
Yes, and we did put clubs in place.

1389
02:43:11,387 --> 02:43:12,387
No, this wasn't a club.

1390
02:43:12,427 --> 02:43:16,289
This was a curriculum.

1391
02:43:16,349 --> 02:43:19,851
They would be tracked, more or less.

1392
02:43:23,753 --> 02:43:25,294
Mr. Benedetto, are you finished?

1393
02:43:25,394 --> 02:43:28,375
Yeah, I'm just trying to help clarify.

1394
02:43:29,156 --> 02:43:33,278
I believe it was a company that was coming in and offering a specific program.

1395
02:43:33,963 --> 02:43:36,164
And that is there.

1396
02:43:36,224 --> 02:43:36,744
That is there.

1397
02:43:36,804 --> 02:43:40,645
That is at the McGlynn, Mighty, I call it Mighty, Midday.

1398
02:43:40,665 --> 02:43:41,166
That's there.

1399
02:43:41,986 --> 02:43:42,306
Meety.

1400
02:43:45,787 --> 02:43:46,587
Odyssey of the Mind.

1401
02:43:51,949 --> 02:43:58,912
I think Miss Lou did do a club that was a club, but not a separate, but again, the idea was there.

1402
02:44:00,052 --> 02:44:02,573
Gifted and talented, full program now.

1403
02:44:03,410 --> 02:44:11,975
requires a person who has not licensure but endorsement to do it, so it's somebody specialized that would have to get that endorsement through DESE.

1404
02:44:12,716 --> 02:44:14,256
But I think, I'm pretty sure Ms.

1405
02:44:14,317 --> 02:44:19,560
Liu did generate something related to the Odyssey of the Mind this past year, and we did.

1406
02:44:19,580 --> 02:44:30,126
We really thought that a lot of the things that we put in place, like the clubs that everyone had access to, would improve some of this, but I really,

1407
02:44:30,967 --> 02:44:38,413
I think it boils down to the unknown leadership, and I think if that is solidified, we may have something happening.

1408
02:44:52,849 --> 02:44:57,953
It's interesting to see this kind of come full circle with me at the end of my school year.

1409
02:44:58,613 --> 02:45:03,337
And yeah, I think it does boil down to unknown leadership.

1410
02:45:03,857 --> 02:45:08,741
I think that's a huge part of it, and the incidents that have happened at the school this year.

1411
02:45:10,462 --> 02:45:15,746
And I know earlier in the year, we talked about launching a PR campaign, and not necessarily

1412
02:45:16,901 --> 02:45:24,663
diminishing the role of the Andrews, because they've done some amazing work as well, but highlighting the achievements of the McGlynn.

1413
02:45:25,703 --> 02:45:30,904
So I think that's super important, and that we should try to use that to attract people back.

1414
02:45:32,165 --> 02:45:35,165
But we also have to keep in mind the concept of equity.

1415
02:45:35,745 --> 02:45:46,248
And we have to make sure that the student populations at both schools are reflective of the community as a whole, and not disproportionate towards ELL populations.

1416
02:45:47,168 --> 02:45:51,591
that's a separate program, but towards certain populations and certain income groups.

1417
02:45:52,231 --> 02:46:06,200
And I think, you know, Mr. Russo raised a really interesting idea of doing half and half of different schools and, you know, we need time to explore that option, but that does ensure in a more fair way that we have

1418
02:46:07,336 --> 02:46:14,101
a fair representation of different income groups and different racial groups and social groups there at both schools.

1419
02:46:14,742 --> 02:46:21,027
So we have to keep in mind that equity is super important in making sure the reputation of our school.

1420
02:46:21,347 --> 02:46:27,171
If you have more challenged population in one school, that's going to be reflected in your test scores.

1421
02:46:27,231 --> 02:46:32,315
And parents are going to look at that and choose one school over the other.

1422
02:46:32,355 --> 02:46:35,518
So we need to make sure that looks fair.

1423
02:46:36,375 --> 02:46:40,277
And another good idea is we talked about cohorts.

1424
02:46:40,578 --> 02:46:41,078
And I know Ms.

1425
02:46:41,558 --> 02:46:50,103
Van der Gloot at the beginning of the year talked about how a lot of parents are choosing the injuries because their friends or the friends of their kids are going there.

1426
02:46:50,603 --> 02:46:52,424
And that's the reality.

1427
02:46:52,725 --> 02:46:55,406
I mean, they are going there because of their cohorts.

1428
02:46:57,145 --> 02:47:03,789
I'm just throwing this out there, and I'm not saying this is a perfect solution by far, but I know Harvard does blocking groups.

1429
02:47:03,949 --> 02:47:11,853
They have cohorts sign up together and request a certain dorm together and certain houses together.

1430
02:47:12,053 --> 02:47:19,057
And I think maybe exploring something along those lines, making sure that we have equity in our lines.

1431
02:47:20,157 --> 02:47:26,601
And I'm not saying it's perfect by any means, but looking at the importance of cohorts in distributing your students.

1432
02:47:28,789 --> 02:47:29,230
Very good.

1433
02:47:29,390 --> 02:47:30,070
Thank you, Justin.

1434
02:47:31,231 --> 02:47:31,371
Ms.

1435
02:47:31,531 --> 02:47:32,211
Mustone.

1436
02:47:32,251 --> 02:47:35,032
More suggestion or just to think about.

1437
02:47:35,453 --> 02:47:42,156
So if we did move half the ELL students to the Andrews, the numbers would be equal.

1438
02:47:43,937 --> 02:47:48,639
The numbers would be equal, but you'd have an issue with staffing.

1439
02:47:48,939 --> 02:47:51,300
This is why we consolidated to one school.

1440
02:47:51,560 --> 02:47:53,601
There are 36 ELL students.

1441
02:47:54,162 --> 02:47:57,043
There are different levels of language proficiency.

1442
02:47:57,531 --> 02:48:01,274
you have your newcomers program and they again have to be housed together.

1443
02:48:02,575 --> 02:48:16,385
Where the McGlynn right now has more space, the new model for the EL, which is something that Mr. Tixera had to do because of CPR, is that we're moving those kids into the regular classes.

1444
02:48:17,025 --> 02:48:20,888
And right now, because of the low class size, there's more room to do that at the McGlynn.

1445
02:48:21,288 --> 02:48:24,971
So there's all kinds of logistical things, but mostly it's staffing because you'd have to have

1446
02:48:26,234 --> 02:48:29,376
more ELL teachers to be over at the other school.

1447
02:48:29,496 --> 02:48:33,819
With the Roberts, we had the program grades one through five.

1448
02:48:33,839 --> 02:48:34,659
You had the newcomers.

1449
02:48:35,019 --> 02:48:38,401
For a few years, we were maxed on physical space.

1450
02:48:39,042 --> 02:48:41,063
This year, grades one and two went to the Brooks.

1451
02:48:41,443 --> 02:48:43,224
Roberts retained three, four, and five.

1452
02:48:44,945 --> 02:48:52,669
I haven't heard much feedback one way or the other, but it freed up physical space in our building at the Roberts.

1453
02:48:54,750 --> 02:49:03,972
just thinking of the 50 families, well, or 29, who end up not getting what they desired in our school choice.

1454
02:49:04,432 --> 02:49:22,537
And if you, the Andrews used to have an ELL program, and we have the staffing for it, maybe that's a way to, and Justin, I guess Justin is what made me think of it, is that you don't want the McGlynn to be almost stigmatized, and if the Andrews has it as well, then we're helping there too.

1455
02:49:23,738 --> 02:49:27,439
So if I could address the transition of grades one and two over to the Brooks.

1456
02:49:27,959 --> 02:49:29,299
That has been very successful.

1457
02:49:29,419 --> 02:49:29,739
Oh, good.

1458
02:49:30,019 --> 02:49:31,519
The Brooks is doing well.

1459
02:49:31,559 --> 02:49:32,940
They love the kiddos over there.

1460
02:49:33,340 --> 02:49:36,300
And the Roberts has now a little more space to work with, which is great.

1461
02:49:37,481 --> 02:49:39,881
The issue is that's a clean mix.

1462
02:49:39,921 --> 02:49:42,362
So you take two teachers and move two teachers.

1463
02:49:42,942 --> 02:49:47,302
I don't think it's as clean when they go to middle school because they're a different content area.

1464
02:49:47,342 --> 02:49:50,043
So there may be more staffing that they need.

1465
02:49:50,586 --> 02:49:52,968
I know, but we're going to get our hands dirty one way or the other.

1466
02:49:53,208 --> 02:49:59,012
Either we're going to have 29 really angry families, or we're going to be dirty our hands with staffing with ELL.

1467
02:49:59,212 --> 02:50:05,217
But I think one of the good points that Beverly mentioned is that the class size is so small at the McGlynn right now.

1468
02:50:05,757 --> 02:50:12,162
With an average class size of 14 and putting more kids in it, that's a great attraction for some families.

1469
02:50:13,383 --> 02:50:18,887
But I love Mr. Russo's idea of friends, because that's a huge draw, I think.

1470
02:50:19,487 --> 02:50:28,151
So if we were able to get to our families and say to our families, do you want to take the chance of the lottery, or do you want your four friends maybe to go together?

1471
02:50:28,191 --> 02:50:29,452
I think that's a great idea.

1472
02:50:29,512 --> 02:50:31,633
So we might be able to bring that up tomorrow.

1473
02:50:31,693 --> 02:50:32,253
Absolutely.

1474
02:50:32,293 --> 02:50:39,116
So I think if people knew that the lottery is a reality, because I don't think people believed us, that we would go to step two.

1475
02:50:39,676 --> 02:50:47,420
But if we put that out tomorrow, that it is indeed the way we're going to go, unless we have people who volunteer to move groups of kids.

1476
02:50:47,884 --> 02:50:52,267
We'll work on that tomorrow, and that could be the simplest solution, and hopefully we'll be all done with it.

1477
02:50:52,367 --> 02:50:55,430
But we'll keep exploring it.

1478
02:50:55,450 --> 02:50:58,172
Paul, did you want to speak about the EL?

1479
02:50:58,292 --> 02:51:00,193
Yep, of course you could come up and speak.

1480
02:51:00,333 --> 02:51:01,474
Of course.

1481
02:51:01,914 --> 02:51:08,840
So just to make it clear, there's also civil rights that are involved regarding the EL program.

1482
02:51:09,723 --> 02:51:15,651
For example, you have different levels of students with English proficiency, as was also stated in all the subject areas.

1483
02:51:16,372 --> 02:51:23,643
So yes, you can say, OK, we can move two teachers over to the Andrews, but that's not going to make the content.

1484
02:51:24,360 --> 02:51:27,001
Oh, I understand if we have to hire four additional teachers.

1485
02:51:27,442 --> 02:51:31,083
I understand that if you don't have the staffing, but we're all just trying also.

1486
02:51:31,104 --> 02:51:41,929
And we can also take a walk around the Andrews and see what space is available because I can tell you right now I'm housing every single classroom possible.

1487
02:51:42,649 --> 02:51:46,231
So we're going to have to get real creative with, with spacing as well.

1488
02:51:46,912 --> 02:51:49,473
Just something to throw out there as well as when you're thinking.

1489
02:51:50,293 --> 02:51:53,314
about doing it, not saying that that's never going to be the case.

1490
02:51:53,374 --> 02:52:05,058
Now, again, we're going to be talking at the admin meeting, but there's also new accountability rules that are coming out as well, as well as, you know, yeah, equity between the two schools.

1491
02:52:05,698 --> 02:52:17,062
If you have four there, you need four that, you know, you need four at the other one, but we also have to make sure the program's working in the right way, making sure that we're covering every student's civil rights as well and getting what they need.

1492
02:52:17,749 --> 02:52:30,757
And I believe, you know, Mr. Tixera's not here this evening, but I believe that we, that the superintendent, he did explore that earlier this year, and Mr. Tixera did not recommend it, so we'll have to go back when I see him tomorrow to his thinking on that.

1493
02:52:31,117 --> 02:52:32,919
But we'll have the discussion, because we'll all be together.

1494
02:52:35,480 --> 02:52:37,241
Mr. Russo, wanted a follow-up on that?

1495
02:52:37,321 --> 02:52:38,022
Yeah, just one follow-up.

1496
02:52:38,302 --> 02:52:43,305
So I just wanted to be clear, you know, that we could send half the kids to each school,

1497
02:52:49,977 --> 02:52:56,979
We could have a policy that half of the children from each school will go to each middle school and move no programs.

1498
02:52:59,280 --> 02:53:01,380
All ELL students could stay in the McGlynn.

1499
02:53:02,000 --> 02:53:05,161
The TLP students could all stay at the Andrews.

1500
02:53:05,341 --> 02:53:06,822
Those are not in conflict.

1501
02:53:07,642 --> 02:53:14,544
There are sufficient spaces if we decided that half the Brooks kids will go here, half will go there, half the Columbus kids.

1502
02:53:14,764 --> 02:53:17,545
There are more than enough spaces to accomplish

1503
02:53:18,193 --> 02:53:25,601
keeping the programmatic stuff where it is and get half the Brooks kids to each school, half the Columbus kids to each school, half the Roberts kids.

1504
02:53:26,341 --> 02:53:33,188
We will run into the issue of the McGlynn children that were looking for the K through 8 experience.

1505
02:53:33,669 --> 02:53:37,913
And so we would have to explore how that would work out.

1506
02:53:38,614 --> 02:53:39,995
That was one of our options.

1507
02:53:41,193 --> 02:53:52,224
but I think at the time we thought we would at least try this one last time so that we could see if voluntarily people would make a commitment and go over to the McGlynn.

1508
02:53:53,145 --> 02:54:01,673
Based on everything you heard tonight, there's enough reason to try it, but I do understand they want to know that the school is in solid hands.

1509
02:54:03,857 --> 02:54:12,542
There's trust right now, and I think people need to continue that, but hopefully they get that commitment in the very near future, and I think that could sway things.

1510
02:54:13,743 --> 02:54:14,503
Mr. Benedetto.

1511
02:54:14,883 --> 02:54:15,223
Thank you.

1512
02:54:17,225 --> 02:54:19,686
There's a lot of good ideas and a lot of things we need to do.

1513
02:54:19,806 --> 02:54:31,212
What we need is what we discussed with our candidates, is a short-term plan for next year, and we need to look at the bigger environment, because other than bodies,

1514
02:54:32,389 --> 02:54:42,375
There are a lot of different things that we need to do, but I don't think doing that in May for September is feasible right now, even though I agree with your long-term idea, okay?

1515
02:54:42,535 --> 02:54:51,140
Because I think that will handle a lot of the other demographics that need to be addressed, but I don't think we'll have enough time.

1516
02:54:51,641 --> 02:54:52,581
I like your idea.

1517
02:54:52,761 --> 02:55:00,246
I don't want to target one school to stay there, because I think opening it up, as you suggested, is gonna be,

1518
02:55:01,570 --> 02:55:07,034
more productive for our community and not targeting people directly.

1519
02:55:07,194 --> 02:55:16,582
And I liked what you said about clinging to people on your microphone and saying, please step up now because we do need this help.

1520
02:55:16,742 --> 02:55:18,983
We don't want to make these decisions for the parents.

1521
02:55:19,304 --> 02:55:25,308
We want parents to be a partner with us deciding how to handle this situation that we're in.

1522
02:55:25,869 --> 02:55:27,410
And that's all I really have to say.

1523
02:55:29,628 --> 02:55:30,329
Just two things.

1524
02:55:30,369 --> 02:55:42,281
I think first, part of my thinking about the McGlynn was simply because the hopefully principal elect, I'll say that, was a proximity.

1525
02:55:42,661 --> 02:55:45,204
However, clearly it does make more sense for him also

1526
02:55:46,500 --> 02:55:52,443
if he takes the position to reach out to other students and other families, and we might need to figure out a way to do that.

1527
02:55:53,044 --> 02:56:02,028
Also, ultimately, when we made the decision, it was really based on finances and put the groups of ELL students together.

1528
02:56:02,368 --> 02:56:07,671
That did disrupt our racial balance plan, which I do have a copy of, and really was

1529
02:56:09,390 --> 02:56:15,476
these schools came out, there was an initial racial balance plan and how we're going to do it and how we select schools.

1530
02:56:15,976 --> 02:56:20,380
And it might be beneficial for the committee to just be aware of what that plan is.

1531
02:56:20,420 --> 02:56:23,923
So we'll talk about that at our next meeting too.

1532
02:56:23,943 --> 02:56:25,425
I'll make sure that people get a copy of it.

1533
02:56:27,186 --> 02:56:27,606
Very good.

1534
02:56:27,907 --> 02:56:29,288
Motion to table this paper?

1535
02:56:29,308 --> 02:56:30,089
No, one more.

1536
02:56:30,329 --> 02:56:30,549
Ms.

1537
02:56:30,609 --> 02:56:31,050
Mostone.

1538
02:56:32,329 --> 02:56:36,591
suggested that Mr. Tucci is debating on whether he would like to stay as principal?

1539
02:56:36,611 --> 02:56:43,855
We've had conversations, and again, I want to give him the freedom to make a choice.

1540
02:56:44,356 --> 02:56:45,516
So we've had conversations.

1541
02:56:45,556 --> 02:56:46,497
He's entertaining it.

1542
02:56:46,677 --> 02:56:51,440
But it's not like you said, by Friday, so we can tell the public that the Magdalene will have a principal in September.

1543
02:56:51,460 --> 02:56:51,560
No.

1544
02:56:51,800 --> 02:56:57,643
I've asked, I talked to him, I believe it was last week, and I've asked him to take two weeks and think about it.

1545
02:56:58,424 --> 02:57:00,665
So we want to make sure that... So the end of next week.

1546
02:57:01,493 --> 02:57:02,193
at the end of next week.

1547
02:57:03,193 --> 02:57:05,254
So that is the 18th?

1548
02:57:06,014 --> 02:57:07,394
It's close, yeah.

1549
02:57:07,414 --> 02:57:07,614
Okay.

1550
02:57:08,254 --> 02:57:09,335
Or I can talk to him sooner.

1551
02:57:10,495 --> 02:57:11,455
I think that would be helpful.

1552
02:57:12,655 --> 02:57:13,375
I will talk to him sooner.

1553
02:57:13,395 --> 02:57:13,916
Mr. Ruggiero.

1554
02:57:14,716 --> 02:57:15,856
I will talk to him tomorrow.

1555
02:57:16,676 --> 02:57:17,036
Okay.

1556
02:57:17,216 --> 02:57:17,436
We'll see.

1557
02:57:17,456 --> 02:57:18,657
Mr. Ruggiero, you all set?

1558
02:57:18,677 --> 02:57:19,197
Yeah.

1559
02:57:19,217 --> 02:57:19,497
All set?

1560
02:57:20,037 --> 02:57:23,178
Is there a motion on the floor to table this paper for two weeks from tonight?

1561
02:57:23,478 --> 02:57:24,658
Offered by Mr. Ruggiero.

1562
02:57:25,955 --> 02:57:26,675
Seconded by Ms.

1563
02:57:26,695 --> 02:57:27,316
Vander Kloot.

1564
02:57:29,036 --> 02:57:29,797
All those in favor?

1565
02:57:30,817 --> 02:57:31,498
All those opposed?

1566
02:57:31,558 --> 02:57:32,198
Motion passes.

1567
02:57:32,458 --> 02:57:33,258
Tabling the paper.

1568
02:57:33,278 --> 02:57:34,239
It'll come back two weeks.

1569
02:57:36,380 --> 02:57:36,680
Of course.

1570
02:57:40,242 --> 02:57:40,742
OK.

1571
02:57:43,843 --> 02:57:50,046
Report on trainer issue and MIAA policy related to soccer game at Beverly High School.

1572
02:57:52,507 --> 02:57:53,328
Mr. Superintendent.

1573
02:57:54,443 --> 02:58:06,907
So as you remember in the fall, there was a situation in which one of our players got hurt and there was an issue about whether the trainer at Beverly High School properly attended to this individual and what was going on.

1574
02:58:07,007 --> 02:58:23,213
So subsequent to that, we've done a number of research items and we've talked about things and I want to read a statement so that the record is clear as to what we think happened and that Mrs. Simonides has some comfort as to her considerations.

1575
02:58:25,378 --> 02:58:35,143
This email is intended to provide, or an email at the time, information regarding the soccer injury that occurred during the game with Beverly High School this fall.

1576
02:58:35,964 --> 02:58:45,169
Consultation with the Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association tells us that the organization considers the situation to be a local matter.

1577
02:58:46,049 --> 02:58:49,331
The requirement to provide certified trainers does not cover all sports.

1578
02:58:49,932 --> 02:58:52,333
Football and hockey do require a trainer to be present

1579
02:58:52,737 --> 02:58:53,837
but other sports do not.

1580
02:58:54,557 --> 02:58:55,558
This includes soccer.

1581
02:58:56,178 --> 02:59:03,920
The MIAA suggests that coaches and referees must take responsibility to determine if a player should not re-enter a game after an injury.

1582
02:59:04,500 --> 02:59:07,441
The cost for certified trainers at every game would be prohibitive.

1583
02:59:08,381 --> 02:59:16,863
As a result, Medford will intensify its training of our coaches and consider hiring an assistant trainer for certain sports to supplement our current staffing.

1584
02:59:17,664 --> 02:59:27,671
Coaches will be instructed to exclude any Medford player who suffers a concussion or any other major injury unless the player is properly examined and cleared by a qualified trainer.

1585
02:59:28,532 --> 02:59:34,977
Any student who suffers such an injury will require a written follow-up report and a subsequent examination by a qualified physician.

1586
02:59:35,857 --> 02:59:46,205
It is also important to note that under MIA rules 56.4, that a trainer, if present, is responsible for both teams when the medical person for the visiting team is not on site.

1587
02:59:47,290 --> 02:59:52,694
The Beverly Public Schools has indicated they will not be rehiring their current trainer going forward.

1588
02:59:54,235 --> 02:59:57,558
They have advertised for contracted training service for next year.

1589
02:59:58,599 --> 03:00:04,904
The Medford Public Schools will initiate a discussion with the Northeast Conference Schools on the issue of appropriate trainer coverage.

1590
03:00:05,965 --> 03:00:12,410
I believe that the above steps are a significant response to the issue, and additional steps may emerge after those kinds of discussions.

1591
03:00:13,362 --> 03:00:14,142
I'd like to thank Ms.

1592
03:00:14,242 --> 03:00:17,643
Simonides for her diligence on this matter.

1593
03:00:18,403 --> 03:00:23,444
Our on-field cameras, evidence, and subsequent investigation supports our interpretation of the events at Beverly.

1594
03:00:24,144 --> 03:00:27,045
We appreciate her commitment to ensuring safety for student athletes.

1595
03:00:30,545 --> 03:00:31,185
Mr. Russo.

1596
03:00:32,186 --> 03:00:39,047
I just really have to, I mean, the MIA's statement about this being cost prohibitive,

1597
03:00:40,400 --> 03:00:51,283
This sentence rubs me so terribly, because what it really is saying is the financial cost is acceptable to be borne by the risk to the student's safety.

1598
03:00:51,983 --> 03:00:56,444
And those two things, one has risen to be more important, and that is the money.

1599
03:01:02,583 --> 03:01:04,704
What is the purpose of MIA?

1600
03:01:05,125 --> 03:01:07,046
Is it really not safety?

1601
03:01:07,746 --> 03:01:10,668
So I'm just really disturbed by that statement.

1602
03:01:11,989 --> 03:01:15,951
I mean, I bet it's cost prohibitive to have them for football.

1603
03:01:17,252 --> 03:01:19,794
Is it cheap for football to have trainers?

1604
03:01:20,274 --> 03:01:21,435
No.

1605
03:01:22,195 --> 03:01:26,518
So why is it, in one way, one situation acceptable and the other one not?

1606
03:01:26,578 --> 03:01:31,641
And I'm just beyond disturbed that that's their excuse for why it's not their problem.

1607
03:01:33,118 --> 03:01:34,019
And I just wanted to rant.

1608
03:01:34,220 --> 03:01:34,540
Thank you.

1609
03:01:35,181 --> 03:01:41,109
So I just would say that ultimately it doesn't need a problem because we'd be paying the bill.

1610
03:01:41,490 --> 03:01:43,813
See, I think they could say, oh, you've got to have one.

1611
03:01:44,454 --> 03:01:46,597
But the reality is, is that how many sports do we have, Bob?

1612
03:01:49,548 --> 03:01:52,812
21 sports, and let's say in every season there's four or five sports.

1613
03:01:52,832 --> 03:01:55,154
I mean, you'd have to have people at every event.

1614
03:01:55,174 --> 03:01:58,638
There's JVs, there's freshmen, there's all kinds of activities.

1615
03:01:59,038 --> 03:01:59,919
It would be difficult.

1616
03:02:00,820 --> 03:02:03,523
So one way to do it is to differentiate staffing.

1617
03:02:03,543 --> 03:02:11,792
We do that with education too in many ways, is to make sure that the people who are on site know enough to respond.

1618
03:02:12,638 --> 03:02:17,300
to take youngsters out of games and not, you just listen to the kids saying, I wanna go back in, I wanna go back in.

1619
03:02:18,061 --> 03:02:23,123
Or to call for medical help and get the youngster to medical help on site.

1620
03:02:24,183 --> 03:02:28,145
Some sports are obviously more combative and more physical.

1621
03:02:28,666 --> 03:02:31,027
There's a higher likelihood of injury.

1622
03:02:31,567 --> 03:02:34,268
So there's a balance wheel here that we can think of.

1623
03:02:34,348 --> 03:02:38,630
If we hire another assistant trainer or some of the time for some of the sports, we will have gone a long way.

1624
03:02:39,171 --> 03:02:42,132
If we intensify our coaches training,

1625
03:02:42,769 --> 03:02:51,857
And we worked with the trainers who from other communities will have gone a long way to at least cover the basics that need to be covered and then move from there.

1626
03:02:52,418 --> 03:02:57,142
But I think, you know, if you think about a trainer, a trainer is going to cost us $60,000, $70,000 a piece.

1627
03:02:57,782 --> 03:03:01,926
So, you know, it's not like it's a, you know, a small investment.

1628
03:03:02,006 --> 03:03:03,327
Just a quick question about this.

1629
03:03:03,547 --> 03:03:08,572
So is there no model for communities to work together?

1630
03:03:09,530 --> 03:03:13,612
whoever, the conference that we're in, I mean, our soccer players are presumably going to Canada.

1631
03:03:15,714 --> 03:03:17,055
We know who we will play.

1632
03:03:18,135 --> 03:03:29,122
Is there no model for sharing this particular, I mean, the idea that sometimes teams come together and they both have a trainer at $60,000, $70,000 a year, that's kind of insane.

1633
03:03:29,802 --> 03:03:38,027
And why wouldn't they be sharing resources and schedule, I mean, the schedule for games is not like every morning you wake up and you guess where you're going.

1634
03:03:38,878 --> 03:03:46,185
So typically the home team provides the trainer, but on that day, for example, there were at least three games going on simultaneously.

1635
03:03:46,665 --> 03:03:49,688
So trainers on three different fields, moving back and forth.

1636
03:03:50,448 --> 03:04:03,841
So, you know, it's obviously a situation where, you know, more is always better, but still, there can be a lot done to mitigate an injury by a person who's watchful,

1637
03:04:05,048 --> 03:04:10,310
not putting a youngster back in the game, calling for medical help, doing what they have to do.

1638
03:04:10,690 --> 03:04:11,811
We can go a long way with that.

1639
03:04:11,831 --> 03:04:18,614
And I think it's very rare that we have a situation that would be totally medical.

1640
03:04:19,314 --> 03:04:20,955
Like in football, you have the ambulance on the field.

1641
03:04:21,195 --> 03:04:22,155
The ambulance is there.

1642
03:04:22,836 --> 03:04:32,660
Other sports, it's more of the, let's say, less, let's say, lethal.

1643
03:04:33,862 --> 03:04:34,523
all kinds of injuries.

1644
03:04:34,643 --> 03:04:36,144
Soccer is known for concussions.

1645
03:04:36,164 --> 03:04:38,266
Soccer and lacrosse and the other two sports, they don't hurt.

1646
03:04:38,306 --> 03:04:41,408
Yeah, you get concussions and the like, but usually it's not, you know.

1647
03:04:43,530 --> 03:04:45,311
Well, it depends on the injury, I guess.

1648
03:04:45,892 --> 03:04:46,032
Ms.

1649
03:04:46,072 --> 03:04:46,352
Kretz.

1650
03:04:46,933 --> 03:04:47,473
Oh, yeah.

1651
03:04:47,773 --> 03:04:50,135
I just wanted to make sure that Ms.

1652
03:04:50,195 --> 03:04:51,977
Simonettis received this report.

1653
03:04:52,017 --> 03:04:52,417
She'll get it.

1654
03:04:52,437 --> 03:04:52,778
She did?

1655
03:04:52,918 --> 03:04:54,439
Okay, and I want to- She will get it.

1656
03:04:54,459 --> 03:04:54,899
Okay, she will?

1657
03:04:55,740 --> 03:04:56,000
She did?

1658
03:04:56,340 --> 03:04:57,982
She already has it now, because I gave it to her.

1659
03:04:58,242 --> 03:05:02,666
Okay, all right, I just wanted to make sure, and I just wanted to also thank her very much for her diligence

1660
03:05:03,427 --> 03:05:05,889
you know, communicating all this information to us.

1661
03:05:06,249 --> 03:05:10,832
It's been a long time and, you know, I'm happy to hear and receive this report tonight.

1662
03:05:11,292 --> 03:05:11,633
Thank you.

1663
03:05:12,173 --> 03:05:12,934
Mr. Ruggiero?

1664
03:05:13,054 --> 03:05:17,317
I just want to remind the body that soccer is the leading cause of concussion among women and girls.

1665
03:05:18,197 --> 03:05:20,979
And it's also in the top two or three among boys.

1666
03:05:21,360 --> 03:05:24,882
So there's a serious concussion risk in soccer.

1667
03:05:24,922 --> 03:05:27,364
People don't think it's a contact sport, but it really is.

1668
03:05:27,444 --> 03:05:29,845
And it's often caused, I mean, my wife sees it.

1669
03:05:31,745 --> 03:05:36,010
So motion to place this report on file by Ms.

1670
03:05:36,050 --> 03:05:37,152
Mostone, seconded by Ms.

1671
03:05:37,192 --> 03:05:37,612
Vandekoot.

1672
03:05:37,652 --> 03:05:38,293
All those in favor?

1673
03:05:38,313 --> 03:05:38,393
Aye.

1674
03:05:39,194 --> 03:05:39,735
All those opposed?

1675
03:05:39,755 --> 03:05:40,516
Motion passes.

1676
03:05:41,277 --> 03:05:43,820
Report on partnership with Lesley University.

1677
03:05:47,204 --> 03:06:04,175
Over the past several months, the city of Medford, school department primarily, and Lesley University, high-ranking officials in Lesley University, in addition, Bob Maloney, Mark Grumley, it's been kind of a full-court press of meetings with this university.

1678
03:06:05,035 --> 03:06:13,561
What brought them to Medford was a desperate need for some athletic space, predominantly the wood floor.

1679
03:06:13,881 --> 03:06:15,542
They would like a wood floor at the high school.

1680
03:06:16,396 --> 03:06:17,657
and also tennis courts.

1681
03:06:18,397 --> 03:06:19,778
That's what brought them to Medford.

1682
03:06:19,818 --> 03:06:24,860
But once they were in Medford, we realized how much more they can offer to this community.

1683
03:06:25,880 --> 03:06:34,864
I've been meeting with several organizations that try to train coaches and school systems in how to deal with trauma.

1684
03:06:35,364 --> 03:06:38,546
Leslie's training people to do that type of work.

1685
03:06:39,306 --> 03:06:42,847
So they have students that will be looking for internships and co-ops.

1686
03:06:44,768 --> 03:06:56,755
to learn in the field how to be great teachers, how to be great social workers, et cetera.

1687
03:06:57,516 --> 03:07:01,118
So we think it's a great idea to move forward with Lesley University.

1688
03:07:01,838 --> 03:07:07,902
The one contractual item would be for the use of the courts in the cages at Medford High School.

1689
03:07:08,902 --> 03:07:11,363
NCAA requires they be wood floors.

1690
03:07:11,444 --> 03:07:13,485
We do not obviously have wood floors right now.

1691
03:07:14,345 --> 03:07:22,810
So they would be making an investment in our cages to put in state-of-the-art wood floors, also the scoring mechanism.

1692
03:07:23,790 --> 03:07:25,071
What other things in the cages?

1693
03:07:25,171 --> 03:07:27,592
Well, they'll be cleaning it up, they'll be painting, they'll be doing lighting.

1694
03:07:27,612 --> 03:07:36,037
Painting, cleaning it, lighting, plus paying us a fee every year to basically rent the space through this partnership.

1695
03:07:36,797 --> 03:07:38,858
Duggar would go through the city side of things.

1696
03:07:39,339 --> 03:07:41,560
Right now they have a permit to use Duggar Park.

1697
03:07:42,139 --> 03:07:45,921
for their tennis courts, but they also would like to have a commitment going forward.

1698
03:07:46,321 --> 03:07:53,506
So we will be working with them on an agreement and likewise, they will be making improvements to the tennis courts, which our high school team plays on.

1699
03:07:53,566 --> 03:07:54,506
That's their home courts.

1700
03:07:55,187 --> 03:07:57,188
So we look at it as a win-win opportunity.

1701
03:07:58,048 --> 03:07:58,369
We think

1702
03:07:59,895 --> 03:08:10,400
We wanted to speak to the school committee about it to get your thoughts but we think it's really something very positive for the school system and to have that partnership with Lesley University for our students as well.

1703
03:08:11,340 --> 03:08:16,643
Hopefully it'll be a matriculation opportunity and we're just very excited about it.

1704
03:08:17,143 --> 03:08:18,664
Mr. Superintendent.

1705
03:08:18,904 --> 03:08:22,986
So one of the things that we've talked a lot about is inclusive education.

1706
03:08:23,646 --> 03:08:26,427
Lesley has a center for inclusive education.

1707
03:08:27,068 --> 03:08:27,748
Lesley has

1708
03:08:28,311 --> 03:08:33,514
specializations for the kinds of things that we have been talking about over and over again.

1709
03:08:34,174 --> 03:08:42,699
They've got specializations for social and emotional learning and trauma and things that we can't have the expertise locally.

1710
03:08:42,819 --> 03:08:43,840
It's just too extensive.

1711
03:08:44,460 --> 03:08:45,601
But we can work that out.

1712
03:08:47,482 --> 03:08:50,884
President of Lesley College actively participated in this.

1713
03:08:50,924 --> 03:08:52,405
This is not low level.

1714
03:08:53,345 --> 03:08:56,267
And we think that their proximity to us

1715
03:08:57,323 --> 03:09:06,849
And the type of programs that they specialize in, the type of university they are, because universities have specializations, is a great fit for what we're doing.

1716
03:09:07,590 --> 03:09:18,857
It also provides us opportunities for professional development for our teachers, professional development for other staff members, and it provides possible some opportunities for adult learning as well.

1717
03:09:19,517 --> 03:09:26,662
So there's this tremendous potential here that will be cost effective and that will not interfere

1718
03:09:27,287 --> 03:09:30,628
with our otherwise operations, and will help us upgrade our facilities.

1719
03:09:31,208 --> 03:09:32,028
This is a win-win.

1720
03:09:32,769 --> 03:09:41,271
So we've got to move forward, because I don't think we're going to get this opportunity again, because they're going to try to find something else if they can't work with us, and they've got a short window.

1721
03:09:42,131 --> 03:09:45,352
And we just want to, we just think it's something we should be supporting.

1722
03:09:46,653 --> 03:09:47,473
Mr. Benedetto.

1723
03:09:47,693 --> 03:09:55,115
First of all, the mayor has said that she's been working on this for months, and this is the first that this body is hearing of this proposal.

1724
03:09:55,468 --> 03:10:00,696
There is such a lack of information given to us this night.

1725
03:10:01,817 --> 03:10:03,620
When will they be using our facilities?

1726
03:10:03,680 --> 03:10:05,383
How much money will they be providing?

1727
03:10:05,463 --> 03:10:07,646
How many courses will our teachers get to take?

1728
03:10:08,027 --> 03:10:12,269
This one-page thing does not tell me anything about this program.

1729
03:10:12,609 --> 03:10:17,932
And if we need to act quickly, then maybe we should have heard about it before the middle of May.

1730
03:10:18,813 --> 03:10:20,874
I'm sorry, but I'm really not happy.

1731
03:10:20,994 --> 03:10:23,475
And we're trying to talk about security.

1732
03:10:23,835 --> 03:10:25,156
Is this for their games?

1733
03:10:25,296 --> 03:10:28,177
Is there going to be spectators in our school gyms?

1734
03:10:28,317 --> 03:10:29,958
When will they be played?

1735
03:10:30,058 --> 03:10:31,939
How is security going to be handled?

1736
03:10:32,179 --> 03:10:33,860
This is a big commitment.

1737
03:10:33,920 --> 03:10:36,982
This isn't a one-pager at the end of a night

1738
03:10:37,482 --> 03:10:50,430
So I would like to table this discussion until we have more information from the district so that we can review a lot more questions and not have this brought before us in this manner at this late time of the evening.

1739
03:10:50,630 --> 03:10:50,990
Thank you.

1740
03:10:51,010 --> 03:10:52,471
Will you withdraw your tabling just so Ms.

1741
03:10:52,531 --> 03:10:53,712
Vianna Klug could make a comment?

1742
03:10:53,752 --> 03:10:53,972
No.

1743
03:10:56,973 --> 03:10:57,754
I said no.

1744
03:10:59,815 --> 03:11:00,976
Tabling is undebatable.

1745
03:11:02,176 --> 03:11:04,398
On the motion to table the paper, all those in favor?

1746
03:11:06,937 --> 03:11:07,937
The chair is in doubt.

1747
03:11:09,638 --> 03:11:10,418
The chair is in doubt.

1748
03:11:10,438 --> 03:11:11,378
Roll call, please, Ms.

1749
03:11:11,418 --> 03:11:11,738
Kretz.

1750
03:11:15,799 --> 03:11:16,119
Yes.

1751
03:11:25,602 --> 03:11:27,663
This is a motion to table the paper.

1752
03:11:27,703 --> 03:11:28,423
It's undebatable.

1753
03:11:33,416 --> 03:11:34,838
We can't talk about it right now.

1754
03:11:35,058 --> 03:11:39,542
Well, if she withdrew it or if it fails, we can talk about it and we can still re-table it at the end.

1755
03:11:39,963 --> 03:11:40,203
Yes.

1756
03:11:40,483 --> 03:11:40,663
Yes.

1757
03:11:59,198 --> 03:11:59,378
No.

1758
03:11:59,819 --> 03:12:01,901
Two in the affirmative, five in the negative.

1759
03:12:01,921 --> 03:12:03,122
Motion fails.

1760
03:12:04,323 --> 03:12:04,463
Ms.

1761
03:12:04,563 --> 03:12:04,923
Vander Kloot.

1762
03:12:05,564 --> 03:12:08,306
So, because I think there are a lot of questions surrounding this.

1763
03:12:08,326 --> 03:12:09,187
Of course, there should be.

1764
03:12:09,207 --> 03:12:11,049
And we definitely need more information.

1765
03:12:11,890 --> 03:12:18,095
I would move the paper to a committee of the whole so that we can discuss it as soon as possible.

1766
03:12:20,918 --> 03:12:21,098
Ms.

1767
03:12:21,138 --> 03:12:21,598
Mustone.

1768
03:12:22,059 --> 03:12:22,739
Division three.

1769
03:12:23,040 --> 03:12:23,200
Yes.

1770
03:12:27,735 --> 03:12:30,636
they do have other sports, but that's predominantly what we're talking about.

1771
03:12:31,956 --> 03:12:34,917
Really, we're talking basketball and cages.

1772
03:12:36,398 --> 03:12:43,160
We would also, at that meeting, is very much want to make sure to have an understanding

1773
03:12:44,475 --> 03:12:47,776
the impact on our student usage at the same time.

1774
03:12:49,116 --> 03:12:50,637
And security, obviously.

1775
03:12:50,677 --> 03:12:53,177
Obviously is a priority.

1776
03:12:53,337 --> 03:13:00,519
I have a thing about the windows in the gym, and man, if they would replace the windows.

1777
03:13:01,559 --> 03:13:02,259
The cow wall?

1778
03:13:06,592 --> 03:13:06,832
Of course.

1779
03:13:06,852 --> 03:13:07,533
Yes, yes.

1780
03:13:07,753 --> 03:13:07,973
So.

1781
03:13:08,533 --> 03:13:12,176
On the motion that the paper be referred to Committee of the Whole, authored by Ms.

1782
03:13:12,196 --> 03:13:13,837
Vander Kloot, seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

1783
03:13:13,857 --> 03:13:14,638
All those in favor?

1784
03:13:15,198 --> 03:13:15,298
Aye.

1785
03:13:15,418 --> 03:13:16,099
All those opposed?

1786
03:13:16,139 --> 03:13:16,779
Motion passes.

1787
03:13:17,020 --> 03:13:17,360
Thank you.

1788
03:13:24,645 --> 03:13:26,927
Report on ALICE program feedback.

1789
03:13:49,734 --> 03:13:50,075
Staff?

1790
03:13:51,546 --> 03:13:57,010
And the first question is, what are some of the key points learned about ALICE in the presentation?

1791
03:13:57,430 --> 03:14:00,772
So I'm just going to go through a few of the points that I thought were pertinent.

1792
03:14:01,673 --> 03:14:06,456
And one was that teachers have options in crisis situation using ALICE.

1793
03:14:07,476 --> 03:14:12,039
It puts students in a safe place, and then they are to alert authorities.

1794
03:14:12,860 --> 03:14:15,742
They can learn developmentally appropriate responses.

1795
03:14:15,782 --> 03:14:17,182
And I think that was important for me.

1796
03:14:18,298 --> 03:14:24,645
with my pre-k to grade five hat to make sure that we're appropriate developmentally with our children.

1797
03:14:24,665 --> 03:14:32,434
And what I thought was very interesting was that you call police instead of 911 and you would get a quicker response.

1798
03:14:33,417 --> 03:14:38,062
The second question that was asked was, what do you believe are some of the benefits of ALICE?

1799
03:14:38,743 --> 03:14:51,258
And our staff said the options for safety, different solutions for various age groups, alerting staff with common language, which I think is very important, and they felt it was a proactive approach.

1800
03:14:54,078 --> 03:14:57,360
What concerns do you have about implementing ALICE in the district?

1801
03:14:58,061 --> 03:15:08,608
One of the main concerns was the cost with our staff, the timeline for approval and for training, reservations at the elementary level, and the raised level of anxiety for students.

1802
03:15:09,108 --> 03:15:13,731
Once again, I was very passionate about that, because I worry about the little ones.

1803
03:15:15,092 --> 03:15:22,998
The timetable moving forward, we don't want to scare or frighten our children, and we need a lot of parent input on this.

1804
03:15:24,183 --> 03:15:32,771
And the last question that we asked was, please list suggestions or statements for future district trainings related to school safety and security.

1805
03:15:33,712 --> 03:15:38,116
And our teachers said security is up to date and the training is effective.

1806
03:15:38,676 --> 03:15:46,683
The meetings on communication, what to do if, additional school resource offices is something that teachers would like to see.

1807
03:15:48,825 --> 03:15:50,667
All drills should be taken seriously.

1808
03:15:51,514 --> 03:15:58,621
We need to create potential preventative measures and look at the mental health of our students as well.

1809
03:15:59,602 --> 03:16:03,106
So interestingly enough, I've been in touch with Tewksbury Public Schools.

1810
03:16:03,767 --> 03:16:07,150
They are going to have a training or a drill, a real drill.

1811
03:16:08,932 --> 03:16:09,453
Excuse me.

1812
03:16:09,993 --> 03:16:10,474
End of the night.

1813
03:16:10,714 --> 03:16:11,395
Can't talk anymore.

1814
03:16:13,187 --> 03:16:14,388
on May 18th.

1815
03:16:14,428 --> 03:16:22,335
So I would like to take a team of teachers and maybe some administrators over to one of the schools in Tewksbury.

1816
03:16:22,755 --> 03:16:31,402
Shannon Demos, who's one of our assistant principals, is from Tewksbury, and she's setting this up for me, for a 5-6 drill and for a 7-8 drill.

1817
03:16:32,303 --> 03:16:41,751
And unfortunately, the K-4 was done in November, so there's no opportunity to see the little ones, but that is something that I'm looking forward to doing on May 18th.

1818
03:16:43,387 --> 03:16:44,508
Great.

1819
03:16:44,548 --> 03:16:45,068
Mr. Russo.

1820
03:16:46,068 --> 03:16:46,748
Thank you very much.

1821
03:16:47,609 --> 03:16:52,311
Well, there was one thing on this report that sort of jumped out at me.

1822
03:16:53,891 --> 03:17:02,395
In all conversations around ALICE that I have heard from the community and from proponents of ALICE, it was, why isn't Medford doing it?

1823
03:17:02,555 --> 03:17:04,156
Literally everybody does it.

1824
03:17:05,256 --> 03:17:08,698
And to see 100 schools, I mean, are there more than 100 schools in Massachusetts?

1825
03:17:08,738 --> 03:17:11,739
I think there's a lot more than 100 schools in Massachusetts.

1826
03:17:12,253 --> 03:17:20,498
So I just think that the hyperbole of we're the only ones not doing it needs to be called out, because it really angered me when I read this.

1827
03:17:21,538 --> 03:17:26,261
I thought we were literally the only ones not doing it.

1828
03:17:26,361 --> 03:17:32,264
The drills twice a year, I mean, if we're going to do it, then we've got to really do it.

1829
03:17:32,725 --> 03:17:39,789
And how many more drills can we put our kids through when they're all doing MCAS all the time, too?

1830
03:17:42,720 --> 03:17:47,003
You know, the other issue I have, oh, can you invite me on the 18th in case?

1831
03:17:47,683 --> 03:17:48,403
Absolutely.

1832
03:17:48,604 --> 03:17:53,266
I mean, we have a quorum, but I actually am available, so I would like to go.

1833
03:17:54,307 --> 03:17:54,627
That's all.

1834
03:17:54,907 --> 03:17:55,268
Thank you.

1835
03:17:55,288 --> 03:17:55,708
I'd like that.

1836
03:17:57,349 --> 03:17:57,429
Ms.

1837
03:17:57,449 --> 03:17:58,329
Van de Kloot.

1838
03:17:58,950 --> 03:18:05,874
Going forward with this, if that's what we ought to do, I mean, I would really, this is something where I really would like to have the superintendent-elect involved.

1839
03:18:06,307 --> 03:18:12,209
I think they've done by something that part of the discussion is I think they've done Alice in Boston.

1840
03:18:12,269 --> 03:18:20,092
So, and so I just, you know, I, I think it will be, I'm very glad you're going out.

1841
03:18:20,713 --> 03:18:25,955
I think that if we, if the new superintendent elect has had,

1842
03:18:27,329 --> 03:18:37,313
some experience with this, that we want to certainly be talking to her right now about this specific item, and wish that you would bring it up, and experience and whatnot.

1843
03:18:37,653 --> 03:18:54,120
I will say, Doctor, I'm sorry, at the Fisk School in Lexington, Mr. Martelone, just, they were doing it, and you know, I hope that he would at least be willing to still have a conversation with us.

1844
03:18:54,820 --> 03:18:56,181
He just might be very useful in

1845
03:18:57,607 --> 03:18:58,587
saying how it goes.

1846
03:18:58,767 --> 03:19:04,189
I do know a teacher who's out there, and I certainly will pursue that to have a conversation with them.

1847
03:19:04,289 --> 03:19:06,029
But if we could reach out to him as well.

1848
03:19:06,729 --> 03:19:07,089
Very good.

1849
03:19:07,269 --> 03:19:07,629
Thank you.

1850
03:19:08,670 --> 03:19:08,990
Thank you.

1851
03:19:10,530 --> 03:19:15,491
Motion to receive this report and place it on file by Mr. Giro, seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

1852
03:19:15,511 --> 03:19:16,271
All those in favor?

1853
03:19:16,292 --> 03:19:16,352
Aye.

1854
03:19:17,092 --> 03:19:17,772
All those opposed?

1855
03:19:18,112 --> 03:19:18,872
Motion passes.

1856
03:19:19,752 --> 03:19:22,073
Pre-budget report mathematics.

1857
03:19:28,118 --> 03:19:29,559
Thank you so much for your patience.

1858
03:19:32,362 --> 03:19:34,403
No problem at all.

1859
03:19:34,543 --> 03:19:35,524
Thank you, everyone.

1860
03:19:35,604 --> 03:19:39,908
I'll be brief and just go through my overview.

1861
03:19:40,008 --> 03:19:42,190
I think everybody has the full report.

1862
03:19:42,911 --> 03:19:44,772
This is the pre-budget report.

1863
03:19:45,413 --> 03:19:54,881
And our program in mathematics, again, is based on the Massachusetts State Framework for Mathematics, which was revised in March of 2017.

1864
03:19:56,880 --> 03:20:05,506
So I've been in the process of revising all our curriculum documents, elementary report cards, in order to reflect the changes.

1865
03:20:06,007 --> 03:20:13,052
Some were cosmetic, but there was a few standard shifts in our K through 12 program.

1866
03:20:14,733 --> 03:20:22,759
And our practices are aligned with our program materials at all levels.

1867
03:20:23,527 --> 03:20:28,531
At the middle school, we have 13 mathematics teachers.

1868
03:20:28,952 --> 03:20:34,937
And at the high school, 15 instructional teachers all have their math licenses.

1869
03:20:35,758 --> 03:20:40,242
And the highlights of the school is, like I said, the curriculum revision.

1870
03:20:40,842 --> 03:20:44,705
The middle school is still reviewing programs.

1871
03:20:45,706 --> 03:20:50,971
They have some pilots that they feel very strongly about that they want to continue for another year.

1872
03:20:51,541 --> 03:20:53,442
because changes have been made.

1873
03:20:54,202 --> 03:21:08,686
Some program materials they just received in April as new additions, so they want to be very responsive to the needs of the students, yet on the other hand, they want to be responsible fiscally.

1874
03:21:09,166 --> 03:21:11,987
So this is a big dollar amount.

1875
03:21:12,347 --> 03:21:17,029
So all the teachers have the new materials in the classrooms.

1876
03:21:17,529 --> 03:21:20,710
We're trying to do an even split on two of the pilots.

1877
03:21:21,117 --> 03:21:30,242
and they're also looking at an online program that's available that is highly rated nationally.

1878
03:21:30,262 --> 03:21:47,433
We're in our second year of implementation of the new program for Algebra I, Geometry, and Algebra II at the high school, and all students participate in this, our English learners, our special education students, and things are going well.

1879
03:21:47,493 --> 03:21:49,394
There's quite a bit of collaboration.

1880
03:21:49,918 --> 03:21:51,219
amongst the faculty.

1881
03:21:52,300 --> 03:21:53,340
It's very healthy.

1882
03:21:53,801 --> 03:21:56,523
They work on common assessments.

1883
03:21:56,643 --> 03:21:58,344
They talk about pacing.

1884
03:21:59,104 --> 03:22:04,668
So our students are really benefiting from their collaboration.

1885
03:22:05,589 --> 03:22:10,673
The professional development this year, again, focused in best practices.

1886
03:22:11,653 --> 03:22:18,258
One initiative that we've just started, which will go into the next school year, is on math protocols.

1887
03:22:18,762 --> 03:22:23,683
And it's a partnership between the mathematics department and special educators.

1888
03:22:24,084 --> 03:22:25,184
And this is K through 12.

1889
03:22:26,584 --> 03:22:32,866
And learning different procedures and protocols for teaching mathematics that will benefit all students.

1890
03:22:33,246 --> 03:22:36,027
So we just finished a train the trainers.

1891
03:22:36,167 --> 03:22:37,647
We did a leadership training.

1892
03:22:38,508 --> 03:22:43,729
They will be doing a planning meeting in June or late May.

1893
03:22:45,390 --> 03:22:46,850
We're still looking at some dates.

1894
03:22:47,502 --> 03:22:51,465
and how to roll it out to the entire K-12 faculty.

1895
03:22:52,766 --> 03:23:08,657
In addition to that, at the elementary level, we had our professional development focused on the standards for mathematical practice, so what it actually looks like in the classroom, and the rigor and such.

1896
03:23:11,439 --> 03:23:15,522
And at the middle and high school, we're going back and

1897
03:23:16,416 --> 03:23:20,640
taking a look at what was working for us pre-Common Core.

1898
03:23:21,340 --> 03:23:23,422
And it was, we wrote a lot.

1899
03:23:23,842 --> 03:23:26,184
We used manipulatives.

1900
03:23:27,125 --> 03:23:36,813
So kind of stepping back a little bit from virtual manipulatives and knowing that with the diversity in our population, sometimes it's best to do hands-on.

1901
03:23:37,194 --> 03:23:43,299
So we're focusing on that and in writing and mathematics to increase achievement.

1902
03:23:43,713 --> 03:23:52,440
The teachers, some of them are using this as their student learning goal and they are showing improvement in their students.

1903
03:23:52,460 --> 03:23:55,422
They're documenting and collecting data on that.

1904
03:23:57,544 --> 03:24:02,468
We, so as I said, we have an integration of students.

1905
03:24:03,008 --> 03:24:11,555
At the high school, it's the vocational technical students or the high school students are taking the same math courses together

1906
03:24:12,050 --> 03:24:15,112
especially the algebra one and geometry.

1907
03:24:15,652 --> 03:24:26,560
And when the vocational students are more academic program, they're able to filter in in some of the other courses because they don't do the week on week off.

1908
03:24:27,280 --> 03:24:29,401
So it's easier to promote that.

1909
03:24:30,142 --> 03:24:35,585
And then we have good integration of EL students now at the high school.

1910
03:24:35,986 --> 03:24:37,807
It's really mostly newcomers.

1911
03:24:38,267 --> 03:24:50,726
that have a substantially separate classroom, but that teacher collaborates with the teachers in the department, and the classroom is with and among the other math teachers.

1912
03:24:51,979 --> 03:24:56,621
The, let me see, I'm going through this quickly for you.

1913
03:24:57,041 --> 03:25:00,163
A collaboration outreach is very strong.

1914
03:25:01,564 --> 03:25:19,472
Really, one thing that's most noteworthy is that just crossed my desk this week was we have seven students who will be going to MIT this summer for, I'd say, a program with Lincoln Labs, no cost at all to the families.

1915
03:25:20,073 --> 03:25:32,115
So the students, what they've done is they've, in partnership with their program, they are taking online courses in programming.

1916
03:25:32,655 --> 03:25:38,576
In the background, we have people at MIT who are watching their progress.

1917
03:25:39,076 --> 03:25:44,317
And then the students are invited into the summer program if they're successful.

1918
03:25:44,677 --> 03:25:47,898
So we've been very successful to have seven students

1919
03:25:48,375 --> 03:25:52,919
invited in, and I believe six are definite to go.

1920
03:25:52,979 --> 03:26:01,387
We're still waiting on one, because these are mostly sophomores and juniors, and some of them need to work during the summer.

1921
03:26:01,907 --> 03:26:06,291
So that's kind of the trade-off, but it's a great experience.

1922
03:26:06,911 --> 03:26:09,153
MIT had approached me last year.

1923
03:26:09,374 --> 03:26:14,258
Last year we had four students accepted, so it's great this year that we have seven.

1924
03:26:15,007 --> 03:26:19,911
And it's a national program, so students are coming from all over the country to participate.

1925
03:26:19,931 --> 03:26:21,152
So this is a great one.

1926
03:26:22,553 --> 03:26:25,895
Tufts University continues to be a good partner.

1927
03:26:26,295 --> 03:26:28,577
So they come whenever we call.

1928
03:26:29,738 --> 03:26:34,701
We have an intern in the department, and we had one previous year.

1929
03:26:35,122 --> 03:26:42,387
And then we also have speakers come in, and a nice relationship there with the computer science department.

1930
03:26:43,665 --> 03:26:55,950
Wentworth Institute, they come in, and they've talked to the high school students in the area of applied math, and that's for all levels of students, but mostly juniors.

1931
03:26:56,010 --> 03:27:00,932
They want them to start thinking about where they're going to be going to school the next years.

1932
03:27:01,532 --> 03:27:04,293
We have a partnership with Harvard University.

1933
03:27:04,853 --> 03:27:12,796
It's an Algebra I project, and it is two years, so next year will be the second year of our involvement

1934
03:27:13,062 --> 03:27:17,686
So we have teachers at the middle and the high school level who are involved with that.

1935
03:27:17,846 --> 03:27:23,271
And it's learning different strategies to teach Algebra 1.

1936
03:27:24,612 --> 03:27:29,996
And again, MIDE has been wonderful to us.

1937
03:27:30,937 --> 03:27:38,984
Their program at the McGlynn Middle School is to help strengthen students' application of engineering

1938
03:27:39,883 --> 03:27:45,007
And in that, with science and mathematics.

1939
03:27:45,427 --> 03:27:53,993
So the students are seeing what they're learning in those content areas, then moves into the engineering.

1940
03:27:54,353 --> 03:27:59,797
They have been great partners for our robotics team, our BAPO team.

1941
03:27:59,857 --> 03:28:02,959
They fully fund their participation.

1942
03:28:03,580 --> 03:28:07,823
This year, Medford came in fourth in the double elimination.

1943
03:28:09,155 --> 03:28:12,038
and the other teams were quite strong.

1944
03:28:12,518 --> 03:28:21,565
They have that, usually their schools have a course where we just have the course in our vocational technical school.

1945
03:28:22,466 --> 03:28:29,412
The students who participate come from both schools, but they do this after school as a club.

1946
03:28:29,432 --> 03:28:32,474
So we're really proud of what they've done this year.

1947
03:28:33,475 --> 03:28:38,419
And we've tried to increase our participation with the parents and

1948
03:28:39,408 --> 03:28:43,089
to bring them more into the classroom to see what the mathematics is about.

1949
03:28:43,449 --> 03:28:57,611
So we had early in the year, we opened up elementary classrooms in every school and parents and guardians were able to go through and kind of experience a typical math class.

1950
03:28:58,272 --> 03:29:01,872
And we did that also at the high school level for the first time this year.

1951
03:29:02,312 --> 03:29:05,353
And it was very well received by parents that came away.

1952
03:29:06,002 --> 03:29:07,603
learning a little bit of the math.

1953
03:29:07,783 --> 03:29:13,246
And I think all of those who were able to come down and attend, I know it meant a lot to the teachers.

1954
03:29:14,187 --> 03:29:15,808
Um, and like I said, this is new.

1955
03:29:16,248 --> 03:29:19,350
We hope they hope to be able to do more again.

1956
03:29:19,450 --> 03:29:22,412
It's just that everybody's schedule is so tight.

1957
03:29:22,792 --> 03:29:27,795
Um, there's so many things going on in the city that people have to choose.

1958
03:29:28,775 --> 03:29:31,397
And, um, so, so it's kind of in,

1959
03:29:32,135 --> 03:29:34,536
in a nutshell, some of the things that we've been doing.

1960
03:29:35,897 --> 03:29:38,798
Use of our funding from last year.

1961
03:29:39,539 --> 03:29:54,506
Again, we were paying for our textbook adoption at the high school level, the instructional program materials, and that goes K through 12, but primarily middle and high school.

1962
03:29:56,127 --> 03:29:56,807
And then the

1963
03:29:58,665 --> 03:30:02,728
allotment for the office supplies is for departmental purposes.

1964
03:30:03,769 --> 03:30:13,976
So how the budget requests differ this year to next year is more on the area of personnel.

1965
03:30:14,856 --> 03:30:24,263
So I'm requesting that we put in place a math teacher and a math lab at the McGlynn Middle School.

1966
03:30:24,323 --> 03:30:25,844
We have that at the Andrews.

1967
03:30:26,348 --> 03:30:28,590
but it does not exist at the McGlynn.

1968
03:30:28,850 --> 03:30:46,426
So we would like to have a licensed teacher put in place there and, um, you know, to help with the math program, um, do some intervention and, uh, just kind of help moving students along before, you know, they get too far behind.

1969
03:30:47,086 --> 03:30:50,910
So we'd like you to consider funding a position there.

1970
03:30:51,492 --> 03:30:53,753
And I'd like to put out a strong call.

1971
03:30:53,813 --> 03:30:55,394
I ask for this every year.

1972
03:30:55,995 --> 03:31:01,318
But there is a need for math coaches in the elementary schools.

1973
03:31:01,938 --> 03:31:07,202
But if we had one in every building, they could serve more purposes.

1974
03:31:08,542 --> 03:31:16,067
We need data specialists, and they could help the principals take a look at data, examine the data.

1975
03:31:17,688 --> 03:31:20,610
And then they can also help with the intervention.

1976
03:31:21,245 --> 03:31:26,486
you know, identify those students, prescribe what's needed for them, and

1977
03:31:27,319 --> 03:31:30,602
if their schedule allows, actually work with the students.

1978
03:31:31,262 --> 03:31:36,307
So that's something that I would like you to think about.

1979
03:31:36,327 --> 03:31:43,793
Those items are very costly because it comes with salary, benefits, and everything else.

1980
03:31:43,833 --> 03:31:44,874
We're aware of it.

1981
03:31:45,394 --> 03:31:53,421
But every year, we look at scores, and everyone's wondering, you know, how are the students doing on MCAS?

1982
03:31:53,921 --> 03:31:56,003
And math comes up, but we have to realize

1983
03:31:56,477 --> 03:31:59,178
that there are some supports that are needed.

1984
03:31:59,939 --> 03:32:13,365
And, you know, I think when you talk to the new superintendent, they'll be familiar with the role of math coaches in Boston schools and then our surrounding location.

1985
03:32:13,845 --> 03:32:17,226
But I think those would help move us along.

1986
03:32:17,767 --> 03:32:21,548
So the textbooks budget is the same as last year.

1987
03:32:21,568 --> 03:32:22,829
We still owe one payment.

1988
03:32:24,458 --> 03:32:25,218
on the high school.

1989
03:32:26,779 --> 03:32:29,360
Instructional materials could stay the same.

1990
03:32:29,800 --> 03:32:40,964
Even if we added the personnel, I should be able to get some of the materials for those people out of the instructional piece and the office supplies.

1991
03:32:41,945 --> 03:32:43,145
So if you have any questions.

1992
03:32:44,486 --> 03:32:45,906
Mr. Russo's first, then Ms.

1993
03:32:45,926 --> 03:32:46,346
Vander Kloot.

1994
03:32:47,307 --> 03:32:48,427
Thank you very much.

1995
03:32:49,427 --> 03:32:53,089
So other than the data analysis,

1996
03:32:55,222 --> 03:32:57,383
What is a math coach doing?

1997
03:32:59,004 --> 03:33:07,627
So the math coach goes into the classroom, makes observations of what the needs might be.

1998
03:33:08,347 --> 03:33:16,831
So actually looks at teacher's practices and how the students are responding to the practices in the classroom and sits and coaches.

1999
03:33:17,091 --> 03:33:24,374
So then they find a common planning time where they sit and they meet and improve upon the teacher's practice.

2000
03:33:24,841 --> 03:33:31,185
Sometimes the coach will actually teach the lesson and show this is what a model lesson looks like.

2001
03:33:31,545 --> 03:33:35,528
So it's a very close dance that they do together.

2002
03:33:35,988 --> 03:33:45,334
And that's the primary role of the math coach is to improve teacher performance, which again will improve the student performance.

2003
03:33:46,135 --> 03:33:46,675
Thank you.

2004
03:33:47,355 --> 03:33:48,076
Thank you.

2005
03:33:48,096 --> 03:33:48,136
Ms.

2006
03:33:48,156 --> 03:33:49,277
Van de Kloot.

2007
03:33:49,297 --> 03:33:54,620
I just want to ask whether the collaboration with Midday is expected to continue next year.

2008
03:33:55,719 --> 03:33:58,501
That is our hopes that we will continue it.

2009
03:33:59,542 --> 03:34:01,263
We started small.

2010
03:34:01,423 --> 03:34:04,005
They didn't know how many engineers that have available.

2011
03:34:04,025 --> 03:34:07,728
I think it's been a big success story all around.

2012
03:34:07,788 --> 03:34:16,875
They've been welcomed, as you heard earlier this evening, by the teachers and found a good fit for those classes.

2013
03:34:17,375 --> 03:34:23,160
So those conversations and how to schedule, then we can bring in the principal.

2014
03:34:23,813 --> 03:34:24,774
and do the scheduling.

2015
03:34:25,235 --> 03:34:37,470
I just think that that's such a strong addition right now, and that's something that we should be marketing, if you would, to prospective students of saying, hey, you know, and I've seen photographs.

2016
03:34:37,510 --> 03:34:38,872
I was over at Midea one day.

2017
03:34:38,932 --> 03:34:43,137
I've talked extensively to them, and they see it as a positive, a win-win.

2018
03:34:44,060 --> 03:34:46,101
their engineers are having a great time with the kids.

2019
03:34:46,661 --> 03:34:50,742
So I just, I think that many parents don't know that it exists.

2020
03:34:51,222 --> 03:34:53,243
So I would like us to see that.

2021
03:34:53,583 --> 03:34:59,725
I'd also like to thank you for all of your years of work with the Medford Public Schools and leading the department.

2022
03:34:59,825 --> 03:35:09,487
We know that you're on the retirement list and I'm sure that must be a little bittersweet, but I just want to make sure that I take a moment to thank you.

2023
03:35:10,428 --> 03:35:10,768
Thank you.

2024
03:35:12,349 --> 03:35:19,712
It's been quite a journey because I came in when accountability started in MCAS and standards.

2025
03:35:19,732 --> 03:35:24,755
It's been nine years in this particular position, leadership position.

2026
03:35:25,535 --> 03:35:28,516
And then we were with the superintendents.

2027
03:35:29,677 --> 03:35:34,099
We put together that science lab that we're all used and love.

2028
03:35:34,199 --> 03:35:38,140
And again, that was a lot of work, several years, many hours.

2029
03:35:40,060 --> 03:35:51,804
We let that happen, and now we're going into the next iteration of, you know, what are the needs and actually moving things forward and, you know, getting new programs in place.

2030
03:35:52,464 --> 03:35:56,465
All those things take time, but I've enjoyed it.

2031
03:35:56,665 --> 03:35:57,985
That keeps you going.

2032
03:35:58,686 --> 03:36:03,947
You know, listening to everything that's happening, it's like, oh, do I really want to leave?

2033
03:36:04,067 --> 03:36:06,108
But I told my family.

2034
03:36:06,658 --> 03:36:07,999
Yes, it's time.

2035
03:36:08,940 --> 03:36:09,440
Thank you.

2036
03:36:09,820 --> 03:36:10,201
Thank you.

2037
03:36:11,502 --> 03:36:12,142
I realize that.

2038
03:36:12,222 --> 03:36:13,023
Mr. Benedetto.

2039
03:36:13,163 --> 03:36:13,523
Thank you.

2040
03:36:13,963 --> 03:36:16,285
I also want to thank you for all your years of service.

2041
03:36:16,325 --> 03:36:17,626
You were my daughter's teacher.

2042
03:36:17,646 --> 03:36:18,687
My daughter's too.

2043
03:36:19,007 --> 03:36:19,908
In AP.

2044
03:36:21,169 --> 03:36:24,831
And you were very tough, very fair.

2045
03:36:25,232 --> 03:36:31,036
They learned a tremendous amount that they carried forward with them, not only to college, but in their life.

2046
03:36:32,717 --> 03:36:34,058
I appreciate that as a parent.

2047
03:36:34,963 --> 03:36:40,508
And as an administrator, you have always been very receptive to the committee and any questions.

2048
03:36:41,369 --> 03:36:44,712
And thank you for all your years of service to the community.

2049
03:36:45,053 --> 03:36:45,433
Thank you.

2050
03:36:45,453 --> 03:36:47,115
It's been a privilege.

2051
03:36:47,695 --> 03:36:48,416
Mr. Ruggiero.

2052
03:36:49,337 --> 03:36:51,078
Thank you once again for your service.

2053
03:36:51,899 --> 03:36:52,800
I just had a quick question.

2054
03:36:53,160 --> 03:36:57,545
Do we participate in the American Math Competition, the AMC 8s, AMC 10s, AMC 12s?

2055
03:37:00,081 --> 03:37:06,026
We have math teams, but they're not in that particular competition.

2056
03:37:06,486 --> 03:37:09,809
But we do have a math team at the high school.

2057
03:37:10,129 --> 03:37:12,411
We sort of have a varsity and junior varsity.

2058
03:37:13,011 --> 03:37:17,895
And so they, it's most, they don't do the face-to-face competition.

2059
03:37:18,576 --> 03:37:22,479
They test and they just send in their scores.

2060
03:37:22,920 --> 03:37:24,461
Yeah, the MTAs are just tests.

2061
03:37:24,541 --> 03:37:27,563
Yeah, and with that,

2062
03:37:28,749 --> 03:37:31,792
We encourage all students to participate.

2063
03:37:32,432 --> 03:37:36,616
So it's not so much about winning and getting the highest scores.

2064
03:37:36,696 --> 03:37:41,740
It's about being part of something and extending their learning.

2065
03:37:42,380 --> 03:37:47,044
Do we do that in the middle school, the eighth grade AMCs?

2066
03:37:47,665 --> 03:37:48,846
I don't believe.

2067
03:37:48,886 --> 03:37:51,748
It's not through my office if it's done.

2068
03:37:51,768 --> 03:37:53,890
It could be done as a club.

2069
03:37:55,171 --> 03:37:56,312
I can check on that for you.

2070
03:38:00,844 --> 03:38:03,446
Motion to accept this report and place it on file.

2071
03:38:04,387 --> 03:38:05,768
Seconded by Mr. Azzurro.

2072
03:38:05,828 --> 03:38:06,589
All those in favor?

2073
03:38:07,469 --> 03:38:08,150
All those opposed?

2074
03:38:08,190 --> 03:38:08,951
Motion passes.

2075
03:38:09,991 --> 03:38:13,694
We also have the pre-budget report on physical education.

2076
03:38:15,916 --> 03:38:17,057
We have an award.

2077
03:38:17,978 --> 03:38:18,238
Okay.

2078
03:38:19,059 --> 03:38:23,202
Recommendation to accept gift from the, I'm sorry, J.S.

2079
03:38:23,322 --> 03:38:24,163
Lim Foundation.

2080
03:38:25,475 --> 03:38:32,018
So I would like to read this so that it's part of publicizing the award.

2081
03:38:32,419 --> 03:38:43,524
The JS Limb Foundation has generously offered a gift of $3,000 to Medford High School to encourage students to engage in rigorous mathematics and science studies.

2082
03:38:44,125 --> 03:38:48,587
The gift recognizes students for academic excellence in these subjects.

2083
03:38:49,567 --> 03:38:50,788
Acceptance of the gift

2084
03:38:51,712 --> 03:38:58,114
requires announcement to the sophomores in the spring of 2018 to promote awareness.

2085
03:38:58,734 --> 03:39:11,058
Two prizes of $1,000 each are presented to juniors who demonstrate top performance in mathematics and science for the 2018-2019 school year.

2086
03:39:11,958 --> 03:39:20,501
An additional $1,000 is designated for administrative costs at the discretion of the awarding committees and headmaster.

2087
03:39:21,167 --> 03:39:26,989
The mathematics awarding committee will consist of the director and teachers of the mathematics department.

2088
03:39:27,369 --> 03:39:33,272
The science awarding committee will consist of the director and teachers of the science department.

2089
03:39:33,812 --> 03:39:37,593
Criteria and selection will meet with the headmaster's approval.

2090
03:39:38,654 --> 03:39:45,697
And this foundation was established in 2010 by MIT professor J.S.

2091
03:39:45,857 --> 03:39:46,197
Lim.

2092
03:39:47,097 --> 03:39:49,018
It's located in Winchester, Mass.

2093
03:39:49,635 --> 03:39:58,598
The foundation expresses that in a global marketplace, mathematics and science skills are critical for the next generation of American professionals.

2094
03:39:59,138 --> 03:40:01,778
One of our missions is to help U.S.

2095
03:40:01,818 --> 03:40:09,561
students reach their fullest potential in these subjects through grants to schools and educational organizations.

2096
03:40:10,461 --> 03:40:17,563
In the process, we hope that our initiatives inspire others to make contributions in their communities.

2097
03:40:18,214 --> 03:40:34,199
This is the second year that the foundation audited this gift to Meffitt High School, and the first awarding of prizes to members of the junior class will take place on Thursday, May 17th at the academic awards evening at Meffitt High School.

2098
03:40:35,099 --> 03:40:35,599
Excellent.

2099
03:40:35,959 --> 03:40:36,779
Mr. Benedetto.

2100
03:40:37,580 --> 03:40:39,280
Motion to accept this award.

2101
03:40:39,400 --> 03:40:41,041
I always want to take in money.

2102
03:40:42,681 --> 03:40:46,122
And thank, could we send a letter of thanks to the foundation?

2103
03:40:47,040 --> 03:40:56,244
as well as invite the junior class members to our next meeting that will be receiving these awards, just so we can honor them as well.

2104
03:40:57,385 --> 03:41:04,448
And the first awarding of prizes will be held on May 17th at the annual academic award evening at Medford High School.

2105
03:41:05,148 --> 03:41:05,488
Oh, okay.

2106
03:41:05,528 --> 03:41:09,590
There's a motion on the floor for approval of this gift, seconded by Ms.

2107
03:41:09,650 --> 03:41:10,210
Van de Kloot.

2108
03:41:10,350 --> 03:41:11,371
Roll call vote, please, Ms.

2109
03:41:11,391 --> 03:41:11,651
Kretz.

2110
03:41:13,272 --> 03:41:13,492
Yes.

2111
03:41:22,491 --> 03:41:24,333
Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero on the negative.

2112
03:41:24,373 --> 03:41:26,955
Motion passes, and we'll also send out a thank you letter.

2113
03:41:27,255 --> 03:41:27,816
Thank you, Ms.

2114
03:41:27,876 --> 03:41:29,177
Joy, for your years of service.

2115
03:41:29,217 --> 03:41:29,697
Thank you.

2116
03:41:29,897 --> 03:41:30,278
Thank you.

2117
03:41:30,298 --> 03:41:36,343
OK, report on pre-budget presentation, health and physical education.

2118
03:41:39,045 --> 03:41:39,505
Good evening.

2119
03:41:39,866 --> 03:41:42,808
Good evening, Mayor Burke, Superintendent Belson, members of the school committee.

2120
03:41:43,308 --> 03:41:44,489
It's been a long night for everyone.

2121
03:41:44,509 --> 03:41:45,851
I'll be as brief as possible.

2122
03:41:46,811 --> 03:41:51,035
I'm just going to go over a few of our accomplishments and then what we're looking for going into next year.

2123
03:41:52,447 --> 03:41:55,669
One of the things we got this year was the Youth Opioid Prevention Grant.

2124
03:41:55,989 --> 03:41:56,330
That was for $18,000.

2125
03:41:56,970 --> 03:42:04,695
And what we did with some of that money is we purchased Michigan model kits for every elementary teacher.

2126
03:42:04,715 --> 03:42:08,357
So every elementary teacher at all four elementary schools have their own kit.

2127
03:42:08,777 --> 03:42:12,699
So they are teaching the social-emotional learning unit in grades K-5.

2128
03:42:14,320 --> 03:42:18,403
We also received the USA Field Hockey Grant for all four elementary schools.

2129
03:42:18,760 --> 03:42:25,585
where we were provided curriculum and field hockey equipment to each school, and field hockey was actually added into our curriculum there.

2130
03:42:25,986 --> 03:42:31,270
We've also added it at the middle schools, hopefully to gain a little bit more interest in that sport.

2131
03:42:32,451 --> 03:42:40,597
We also received the Game Change grant through the New England Patriots, and that was a $3,000 grant, and that's an anti-violence grant.

2132
03:42:41,097 --> 03:42:46,882
We had people from Game Change come in and train about 25 high school students,

2133
03:42:47,329 --> 03:42:50,251
And they actually brought that down to the middle school students as well.

2134
03:42:50,852 --> 03:42:55,615
We've also incorporated some of those lessons into our freshman health curriculum.

2135
03:42:56,035 --> 03:43:00,759
So within the past two years, all of our freshmen, all of our sophomores have been trained in it as well.

2136
03:43:01,239 --> 03:43:05,002
And we'll continue to bring that down to the health classes at the middle school as well.

2137
03:43:06,703 --> 03:43:12,568
We also have introduced lifeguard training course as a physical education elective at the high school.

2138
03:43:14,963 --> 03:43:17,364
our course selection catalog for this year.

2139
03:43:17,424 --> 03:43:24,166
So next year, students will be able to take that as a physical education elective and get certified right through that class.

2140
03:43:24,926 --> 03:43:31,228
So the last thing, we've added yoga units to the K to 8 physical education curriculum.

2141
03:43:32,949 --> 03:43:35,950
So I've done one training with my staff.

2142
03:43:35,970 --> 03:43:37,470
We're doing another one next week.

2143
03:43:38,390 --> 03:43:38,990
So that's K to 8.

2144
03:43:39,491 --> 03:43:40,531
We already have it at the high school.

2145
03:43:40,551 --> 03:43:42,432
We have a yoga 1 and a yoga 2 class.

2146
03:43:44,606 --> 03:43:54,830
Looking forward to next year, I'm looking for level funding for travel, office supplies, textbooks, educational supplies, maintenance of equipment, and for fitness center supervision.

2147
03:43:56,030 --> 03:44:00,331
What we are looking for is to increase staffing by two positions.

2148
03:44:01,052 --> 03:44:02,792
I have asked for these positions in the past.

2149
03:44:03,172 --> 03:44:07,514
Last year, I asked for two health teachers at the middle school, where we got one.

2150
03:44:07,954 --> 03:44:13,356
We're looking for one more so that we have one full time at each school, which will help us with

2151
03:44:13,897 --> 03:44:19,179
scheduling and making sure that all of our students are getting the Michigan model in 6th, 7th, and 8th grade.

2152
03:44:20,600 --> 03:44:27,262
The next piece we're looking for is increase in physical education staffing for an adaptive physical education teacher.

2153
03:44:28,143 --> 03:44:30,584
And this is not to take away from inclusion.

2154
03:44:30,604 --> 03:44:32,224
We're still including our students.

2155
03:44:32,484 --> 03:44:41,948
But this is in addition to help maybe a push-in or co-teaching model where we have that adaptive teacher that can go into classes to help our physical education teachers.

2156
03:44:42,335 --> 03:44:43,977
with students that might need extra help.

2157
03:44:46,179 --> 03:44:47,140
Does anyone have any questions?

2158
03:44:47,180 --> 03:44:47,440
Excellent.

2159
03:44:47,501 --> 03:44:48,301
Are there any questions?

2160
03:44:48,682 --> 03:44:49,322
Mr. Russo.

2161
03:44:51,225 --> 03:45:03,778
I was a little surprised by, thank you by the way for the report, I was surprised to see that the Brooks and the McGlynn only have one full time PE teacher and then the Columbus has one and a half.

2162
03:45:04,738 --> 03:45:17,149
even though the Columbus has like a hundred and something students fewer than the Brooks and even more fewer, if that's a thing, than the McGlynn.

2163
03:45:18,651 --> 03:45:20,512
Is there a history?

2164
03:45:20,572 --> 03:45:22,474
Like, why is this situation this way?

2165
03:45:22,514 --> 03:45:24,176
To me, it seems a little odd.

2166
03:45:25,357 --> 03:45:27,378
So when I started the position, that's what we had.

2167
03:45:27,418 --> 03:45:31,342
And we do have the... Our teachers' schedules are full.

2168
03:45:32,676 --> 03:45:34,177
going back and forth in both schools.

2169
03:45:34,197 --> 03:45:38,681
I don't know if there's anything else.

2170
03:45:40,182 --> 03:45:44,166
So I think there's a balance with the specialists in every building.

2171
03:45:44,186 --> 03:45:52,993
If you look at maybe the art teachers in the different buildings, they may have more than the Columbus and the McGlynn have.

2172
03:45:53,053 --> 03:45:55,135
So I think it's a balance that they do.

2173
03:45:59,947 --> 03:46:04,490
I'm not sure how it began, it was before me, but that's what it looked like years ago.

2174
03:46:04,510 --> 03:46:05,470
Mr. Superintendent.

2175
03:46:05,510 --> 03:46:13,355
So another aspect of it is the fact that in some cases we have programs like the TLP program that needs its own person to cover it.

2176
03:46:13,375 --> 03:46:17,117
And I mean because you can't mix those kids in as easily as you might like.

2177
03:46:17,858 --> 03:46:26,143
Some other specialized programs so that the schedule around them requires a little differentiated staffing.

2178
03:46:26,163 --> 03:46:28,564
Thank you.

2179
03:46:28,644 --> 03:46:28,724
Ms.

2180
03:46:28,784 --> 03:46:29,345
Millstone.

2181
03:46:31,557 --> 03:46:36,819
I think I've never even heard of an adaptive physical education teacher, so that seems very exciting.

2182
03:46:37,659 --> 03:46:42,281
Is the plan that they would co-teach with Mr. McGlynn at the Roberts?

2183
03:46:43,761 --> 03:46:44,021
Yes.

2184
03:46:44,041 --> 03:46:49,223
Would they go in and tell Mr. McGlynn or share ideas with Mr. McGlynn and travel the schools or?

2185
03:46:49,483 --> 03:46:51,243
So it would be a teacher for the full district.

2186
03:46:51,343 --> 03:46:51,644
Okay.

2187
03:46:51,764 --> 03:46:55,865
We could co-teach and have that teacher go in and teach with physical education teachers.

2188
03:46:56,292 --> 03:47:03,480
It could also be a point where we still have students in inclusion, but we give them also an alternative where we also pull out and are able to work one-on-one.

2189
03:47:13,927 --> 03:47:15,228
that your staff have.

2190
03:47:17,110 --> 03:47:33,763
I was under the impression that this body had adopted safety care across the district, and I wasn't sure who has been trained or has not been trained on that, and you probably don't actually have the answer, but is this new for your staff to do this?

2191
03:47:33,964 --> 03:47:35,345
So I know my staff has been trained.

2192
03:47:35,365 --> 03:47:38,487
We've been doing it for the past two years, and they have to retrain every year.

2193
03:47:39,028 --> 03:47:40,029
It's an every year training.

2194
03:47:42,763 --> 03:47:43,523
Mr. Benedetto.

2195
03:47:43,743 --> 03:47:44,103
Thank you.

2196
03:47:44,844 --> 03:47:52,568
That's run out of the special education department is my understanding under Kathy Medaglio and that student services.

2197
03:47:54,269 --> 03:48:00,372
I know because at my school, I'm the trainer in safety care and in CPI.

2198
03:48:02,373 --> 03:48:11,037
So what happens is that you need a team of teachers that are able to respond to an emergency situation so you can be called away.

2199
03:48:11,655 --> 03:48:26,542
And a gym teacher or a physical education teacher or other specialists are usually on that team because they have the most flexibility in their schedule and can respond very quickly to different situations.

2200
03:48:27,262 --> 03:48:34,926
Whereas a classroom teacher might have at any given time 20 students in their care and not be able to respond easily.

2201
03:48:36,238 --> 03:48:48,262
I call them classroom teachers because they do teach classes of children, but they just have a little bit more flexibility about being around the building.

2202
03:48:50,202 --> 03:48:57,104
And they're alone sometimes in different areas of the building, so it's good to have them trained.

2203
03:48:59,926 --> 03:49:04,268
There's a motion to accept this report, place it on file by Mr. Giro, seconded by Ms.

2204
03:49:04,328 --> 03:49:04,648
Kretz.

2205
03:49:05,368 --> 03:49:06,128
All those in favor?

2206
03:49:06,348 --> 03:49:07,069
All those opposed?

2207
03:49:07,149 --> 03:49:07,949
Thank you very much, Ms.

2208
03:49:07,989 --> 03:49:08,689
Perry, as always.

2209
03:49:08,709 --> 03:49:09,029
Thank you.

2210
03:49:09,209 --> 03:49:10,050
Thank you, Rachel.

2211
03:49:14,431 --> 03:49:15,452
Financial report.

2212
03:49:20,734 --> 03:49:21,274
Good evening, Ms.

2213
03:49:21,354 --> 03:49:21,614
Pabst.

2214
03:49:21,674 --> 03:49:22,234
Good evening.

2215
03:49:22,254 --> 03:49:25,616
I had hoped Rachel would offer up some exercises in between.

2216
03:49:25,656 --> 03:49:26,776
I know, wake us up a little.

2217
03:49:26,796 --> 03:49:28,817
Yeah, we'll keep trucking along here.

2218
03:49:32,513 --> 03:49:37,720
So the first item we have for you is the financial report.

2219
03:49:38,681 --> 03:49:46,432
As a reminder, the document that's provided is the expanded document, budget document, that focuses on the DESE reporting.

2220
03:49:46,895 --> 03:49:49,617
by function category, schools, departments.

2221
03:49:50,398 --> 03:49:57,823
The bottom line that we are looking at is the total appropriation amount plus the revenue that the schools balance their budget.

2222
03:49:58,464 --> 03:50:11,954
So open budget lines were in concert with our past budgets to identify some of those DESE categories and our revenue offsets will be adjusted at year end, just going into the financial reporting.

2223
03:50:12,552 --> 03:50:22,078
So again, as the financial report identifies, we approach the final two months projecting a balanced budget for the fiscal year ending 2018.

2224
03:50:22,938 --> 03:50:25,120
This has been a very challenging year.

2225
03:50:25,580 --> 03:50:29,983
We've had to deal with multiple unexpected and increased cost factors, significant.

2226
03:50:31,384 --> 03:50:41,970
Still with those challenges, we've had some resourceful development and applications of supplemental revenue that we will be enabled, the school system to meet its obligations

2227
03:50:42,529 --> 03:50:48,212
barring any additional major unforeseen situations that could occur in the next two months.

2228
03:50:49,352 --> 03:50:58,957
As we prepare for our upcoming fiscal year and with the new superintendent budget process, we do need to augment several accounts and sustain our resources and revenue generation abilities.

2229
03:50:59,797 --> 03:51:03,959
New expenditures must be carefully prioritized and choices will have to be made.

2230
03:51:04,379 --> 03:51:11,723
Again, as we hear all the great things that every department and schools want to accomplish, that does impact the

2231
03:51:12,401 --> 03:51:18,083
budget and what we will be requesting at the end of our FY19 budget process.

2232
03:51:18,763 --> 03:51:29,186
We are also, as you are aware, in collective bargaining with our union personnel, which is significant and going into the FY19 budget without any indication.

2233
03:51:30,197 --> 03:51:36,041
Every year at this time, we freeze discretionary funds to monitor the balances through year end.

2234
03:51:36,661 --> 03:51:46,027
There are several unexpected additional budget drivers that are being carried at this time without known ending dates, with security overtime as a prime example.

2235
03:51:47,067 --> 03:51:52,911
The following we've identified have incurred post-budget approval from fiscal year 2018.

2236
03:51:53,311 --> 03:51:57,694
The first item was our regular transportation.

2237
03:51:57,734 --> 03:51:58,414
Again, we had

2238
03:51:58,990 --> 03:52:17,026
been proactive to reduce one bus and we had to add more than one route back into the schedule for those important programs that were identified post-budget, which were for the newcomers, the additional after-school runs, and new Columbus after-school tutoring programs.

2239
03:52:18,046 --> 03:52:19,808
Additionally, homeless transportation

2240
03:52:20,343 --> 03:52:29,874
continues to grow despite efforts to mitigate costs by utilizing mileage reimbursements and shared rides and consolidations.

2241
03:52:29,994 --> 03:52:35,480
This is an area that impacts many school districts in the Commonwealth, not just Medford.

2242
03:52:36,653 --> 03:52:40,677
Audit expenses were significantly different.

2243
03:52:40,717 --> 03:52:45,861
We had a new auditor, so those are charged to the schools that are within the school committee area.

2244
03:52:46,662 --> 03:52:49,564
Specialized one-to-one nurses for severe needs students.

2245
03:52:49,685 --> 03:52:54,409
Those required hiring of nurses that were not anticipated in the FY18 budget.

2246
03:52:55,350 --> 03:52:59,153
Additional staffing for the consolidation of the high school and vocational school.

2247
03:53:00,545 --> 03:53:08,551
That did also impact the budget, and yet it has been very successful in that implementation and transition.

2248
03:53:10,393 --> 03:53:15,557
Security over time, as we know that continues to be a cost factor.

2249
03:53:17,714 --> 03:53:26,816
And as we go through the general fund, as we looked at the approval for FY18, it was the $56,431,000, of which we are at 82 percent.

2250
03:53:26,896 --> 03:53:32,857
So if you categorize that over 12 months, we are right on track for the last 20 percent over May and June.

2251
03:53:34,378 --> 03:53:42,660
We did have the approved free cash vote for security and E-rate items that is added to our bottom line budget, increasing the total amount to $56,925,000.

2252
03:53:45,494 --> 03:53:50,618
So again, we identify how many pay periods each bargaining group has received.

2253
03:53:51,359 --> 03:53:59,425
When we review the specific categories, salaries is always an area that has fluidity.

2254
03:53:59,965 --> 03:54:08,632
The undistributed salary line has been expensed and dispersed to various account deficits in line with where some transition and movement has occurred.

2255
03:54:09,733 --> 03:54:12,135
So the special ed categories have historically

2256
03:54:13,013 --> 03:54:22,363
not had an affiliated budget amount as much of those amounts are supported by some of the outside revenue offsets that we project and plan as part of the budgeting process.

2257
03:54:22,844 --> 03:54:31,533
Again, as we look at the expanded document, those are DESI reporting categories, not necessarily our bottom line item.

2258
03:54:33,603 --> 03:54:44,253
We have numerous retirements that will have some contractual vacation and or sick time buybacks that will occur, some within the FY18 and others that can be planned for FY19.

2259
03:54:46,328 --> 03:54:49,429
and that's in accordance with their collective bargaining agreement language.

2260
03:54:50,429 --> 03:54:52,590
Security continues to be a priority.

2261
03:54:53,330 --> 03:54:58,492
We continue to demonstrate the commitment for ensuring the safety at all the school site locations.

2262
03:54:59,212 --> 03:55:03,213
Again, we've added the cameras, locks, and door monitoring coverage.

2263
03:55:03,933 --> 03:55:10,375
However, the unanticipated level of overtime in this category continues to impact the budget right now.

2264
03:55:11,170 --> 03:55:18,492
and was not planned for in reference to the additional overtime component.

2265
03:55:19,213 --> 03:55:24,434
And a long-term funding solution will need to be addressed and or planned going forward.

2266
03:55:25,775 --> 03:55:38,139
Technology, the commitment of infusing $102,000 of funding into the schools at the beginning of the year was accommodated in order to have that utilization over the course of fiscal year 18.

2267
03:55:39,327 --> 03:55:56,416
that did provide additional support for testing and instructional support district-wide, and we will continue to make those technology improvements with the E-rate funding and the upgrades that are intended to take place over the summer to be ready for the FY19 school year.

2268
03:55:57,657 --> 03:56:08,543
Our utilities, we always try to be conservative in budgeting and projecting in that category, and we encumber based on historical years usage and what we anticipate the

2269
03:56:09,826 --> 03:56:13,848
contractual amounts to be going forward next year, beginning in November of 2018.

2270
03:56:13,928 --> 03:56:20,651
We will have a change in the electricity rate, so we will have to plan and project for that.

2271
03:56:21,611 --> 03:56:24,872
Currently, the natural gas rates are favorable.

2272
03:56:24,972 --> 03:56:36,437
However, we have seen an increase in our therm usage due to some of the cold winter months, and we will have expenditures higher in that line item prior than the previous year.

2273
03:56:37,499 --> 03:56:39,921
for that purpose because of the higher therm usage.

2274
03:56:41,042 --> 03:56:50,430
The second half of the expense activity was timeframe January through March, so we still have April, May, and June of utility bills to be processed.

2275
03:56:50,830 --> 03:57:00,698
So we do, again, maintain an encumbrance to accommodate the anticipated invoices that will come through the end of June.

2276
03:57:00,718 --> 03:57:01,438
Again,

2277
03:57:02,780 --> 03:57:04,200
best estimate at this point.

2278
03:57:04,280 --> 03:57:11,663
We do not know what those actuals will be, so we are keeping those encumbrances in place right now.

2279
03:57:14,764 --> 03:57:26,367
So our year-to-date expense, again, is trending slightly higher than our midpoint last year, about $47,949 higher, and we will likely expend the full budget amount in our electricity line.

2280
03:57:27,387 --> 03:57:42,663
Again, the city and schools are in communication and cooperation trying to identify other energy improvements that will continue to help maintain and hopefully reduce some costs with other projects in line.

2281
03:57:43,758 --> 03:57:55,785
So in summary, we are working very hard to contain the costs for this year with all of the unexpected items that have occurred and minimize the year-end purchases to offset some of those identified challenges.

2282
03:57:56,806 --> 03:58:12,195
As we prepare for the 18-19 budget, it's imperative that we recognize the increases in some of the major categories and prioritize with the anticipation of collective bargaining settlements, our continued investment in security and transportation, as well as all the variable costs.

2283
03:58:12,710 --> 03:58:23,093
such as the staffing needs that we've heard about that are so important, utilities that are going to hit, and all of the other important areas for our budget.

2284
03:58:23,233 --> 03:58:23,974
Thank you very much.

2285
03:58:24,534 --> 03:58:27,595
Mr. Benedetto.

2286
03:58:27,755 --> 03:58:28,135
Thank you.

2287
03:58:28,495 --> 03:58:29,435
Thank you for your report.

2288
03:58:30,756 --> 03:58:36,998
Do you happen to have a breakdown of the additional security costs since we added the dual monitors?

2289
03:58:38,033 --> 03:58:43,799
Well, as you can see, the overtime is roughly $30,000 between the two line items.

2290
03:58:46,101 --> 03:58:58,153
And that's just in this line item, so we do have other overtime costs that are in other program areas, such as community schools and other areas as well that have door coverage.

2291
03:58:58,950 --> 03:59:04,433
I was just wondering what the total cost was that, and I don't know how difficult that'd be for you to get to us.

2292
03:59:04,633 --> 03:59:11,177
Just an idea so that we can use that figure to pre-plan for next year, if that's the route that we're gonna go.

2293
03:59:11,197 --> 03:59:12,478
It would be helpful.

2294
03:59:13,498 --> 03:59:16,380
Also, could you provide us a copy of the last audit?

2295
03:59:16,480 --> 03:59:22,683
I know it was requested at one of our... It is just being finalized right now.

2296
03:59:22,944 --> 03:59:23,144
Okay.

2297
03:59:23,164 --> 03:59:26,145
So it hasn't been held, it just hasn't been completed.

2298
03:59:26,465 --> 03:59:26,906
Perfect.

2299
03:59:27,814 --> 03:59:28,154
Thank you.

2300
03:59:28,414 --> 03:59:31,656
Um, so can we have that on the requested reports list, please?

2301
03:59:31,816 --> 03:59:36,419
The, um, a copy of the audit, the last financial audit.

2302
03:59:37,580 --> 03:59:37,800
Okay.

2303
03:59:38,300 --> 03:59:45,925
And, um, while we were talking about security, it brought up a question that is really not for you, um, miss Patterson.

2304
03:59:45,965 --> 03:59:46,485
Thank you though.

2305
03:59:46,966 --> 03:59:48,086
Um, it's for the mayor.

2306
03:59:48,186 --> 03:59:55,631
Could she please, could you please, with all respect, give us an update on the report from the Martha Coakley law firm.

2307
03:59:56,160 --> 04:00:00,623
We have not received the report from Foley-Hoag, Martha Coakley's report.

2308
04:00:01,504 --> 04:00:07,569
It obviously, the police report came in much later than we anticipated, so she wanted to make sure she had that information.

2309
04:00:08,209 --> 04:00:10,331
So we are hopeful that we will have it in the next week.

2310
04:00:12,252 --> 04:00:12,412
Okay.

2311
04:00:12,612 --> 04:00:21,239
And a follow-up, it's not so much a financial follow-up, but a few more reports that were requested that weren't on the requester reports list.

2312
04:00:21,259 --> 04:00:25,562
So while I was talking about it, I thought I'd bring it up to Mr. Belson.

2313
04:00:26,423 --> 04:00:36,725
A report on the traffic pattern at the pool door so that way we can make determinations if we're moving that person at nine o'clock in the morning down to the vocational school.

2314
04:00:37,505 --> 04:00:40,126
Could you add that to the list so that can be provided to us?

2315
04:00:40,966 --> 04:00:42,166
It's just a tally, really.

2316
04:00:43,406 --> 04:00:46,567
The community school usage I just received now.

2317
04:00:47,727 --> 04:00:48,608
So I'll look at that.

2318
04:00:49,168 --> 04:00:50,248
I mean, we got this tonight.

2319
04:00:50,728 --> 04:00:53,869
This has all the rentals for the community schools for the year, I believe.

2320
04:00:54,029 --> 04:00:55,729
Is that what this report is?

2321
04:00:58,095 --> 04:01:01,516
That's rentals and just general usage of the building.

2322
04:01:01,836 --> 04:01:07,218
And again, there was no ill intent of not providing that.

2323
04:01:07,238 --> 04:01:11,760
It was this sheer volume of not being able to, and we utilized our graphics department.

2324
04:01:11,780 --> 04:01:13,260
No, I appreciate you having it.

2325
04:01:13,300 --> 04:01:17,202
I'm gonna look at it, and if I have any questions, I'll bring them up at our next meeting.

2326
04:01:17,602 --> 04:01:25,085
I just wanted to say thank you for providing that for us, and I know the financial report on that is coming up next.

2327
04:01:27,352 --> 04:01:38,199
Mr. Belson's report on the cost analyst feasibility study for the items suggested on the building and grounds meeting, that report is not listed here.

2328
04:01:40,200 --> 04:01:50,666
Remember, Roy, you were talking about giving us a feasibility study and prices for the buildings and grounds items that were suggested.

2329
04:01:54,982 --> 04:01:57,363
He's having trouble understanding.

2330
04:01:57,523 --> 04:02:00,425
You want something, can you write down the reports that you believe are missing?

2331
04:02:00,725 --> 04:02:00,885
Yep.

2332
04:02:01,205 --> 04:02:04,886
Instead, then submit it, just email him tomorrow and he can look them over.

2333
04:02:05,146 --> 04:02:07,787
Yeah, and I just want to announce them so everybody knows as well.

2334
04:02:08,147 --> 04:02:18,191
In requested number of bullying reports completed by school, that was requested by someone I noticed in the minutes that wasn't added to the list.

2335
04:02:19,172 --> 04:02:21,813
Bullying reports.

2336
04:02:21,833 --> 04:02:22,833
The number by school.

2337
04:02:23,558 --> 04:02:29,360
And again, the list of retirements coming forward, so that way we have that data as well.

2338
04:02:33,082 --> 04:02:33,482
Thank you.

2339
04:02:33,682 --> 04:02:42,486
I really appreciate the report you provided to us on the finance budget and the time that your department took to present this to us.

2340
04:02:42,706 --> 04:02:43,106
Thank you.

2341
04:02:44,947 --> 04:02:47,127
Motion to approve report and place on file.

2342
04:02:47,147 --> 04:02:48,388
Motion to accept this report.

2343
04:02:49,328 --> 04:02:50,289
Place it on file, Ms.

2344
04:02:50,309 --> 04:02:50,629
Ruggiero.

2345
04:02:51,307 --> 04:02:52,407
Yeah, I just have two questions.

2346
04:02:52,447 --> 04:02:53,888
Thank you so much for putting this together.

2347
04:02:54,608 --> 04:02:58,809
On page one of 13, this is of the financial year budget expenditure.

2348
04:02:59,649 --> 04:03:03,811
Could you just explain what errors and omissions, what that line item is?

2349
04:03:03,851 --> 04:03:06,831
That's insurance coverage for the school district.

2350
04:03:07,111 --> 04:03:07,732
I see, I see.

2351
04:03:07,772 --> 04:03:10,152
Okay, thank you just for clarifying that for my brain.

2352
04:03:10,172 --> 04:03:11,973
I'm a little sleepy right now.

2353
04:03:11,993 --> 04:03:19,355
And also, on page two of 13, I had a question about the photocopy lease and purchase.

2354
04:03:19,997 --> 04:03:27,364
Yes, that was a renewal of the leases throughout the district, and there was a slight increase.

2355
04:03:27,444 --> 04:03:35,371
It's a contractual increase, so there are two payment installments left, roughly $11,000 each, so the encumbrance stands correct at $22,000.

2356
04:03:35,451 --> 04:03:35,711
Thank you.

2357
04:03:39,550 --> 04:03:42,891
There's a motion on the floor to accept this report and place it on file.

2358
04:03:42,911 --> 04:03:45,272
Is there a second by Mr. Russo?

2359
04:03:45,472 --> 04:03:45,672
Ms.

2360
04:03:45,812 --> 04:03:46,892
Vander Kloot, did you have a question?

2361
04:03:47,153 --> 04:03:49,693
I just wanted to thank you for staying so long tonight.

2362
04:03:49,993 --> 04:03:52,594
I know it's a long drive home too, so I really appreciate it.

2363
04:03:53,334 --> 04:03:55,095
I'll be getting breakfast on my way home.

2364
04:03:55,295 --> 04:03:55,995
Yeah.

2365
04:03:56,035 --> 04:03:56,515
Thank you, Kirsten.

2366
04:04:00,028 --> 04:04:04,071
We also have up next is the financial report on community schools programs.

2367
04:04:04,531 --> 04:04:04,751
Yes.

2368
04:04:05,012 --> 04:04:11,917
So again, this is a recap of the activity that has occurred to date.

2369
04:04:12,077 --> 04:04:14,799
Again, it's important to understand.

2370
04:04:14,839 --> 04:04:27,188
I gave this a little bit more of a learning curve for some of the new members just so that you understood how the revolving accounts and which community schools falls under is handled.

2371
04:04:27,987 --> 04:04:39,870
So again, your packet included the community schools programming, which you received a large packet this evening for all the dates and times and locations of everything throughout the school year.

2372
04:04:40,870 --> 04:04:49,672
You also received the program documents for the rentals, the athletic revolving, the Conti rink, Edgerly Field, and the swimming pool.

2373
04:04:50,532 --> 04:04:54,733
So again, the program managers have provided summaries of all of their

2374
04:04:56,039 --> 04:05:17,180
recorded revenues, expenditures, and as I went through and did what you could call a pseudo-internal audit, they do a very good job, a thorough job of keeping their records and knowing what is out there and what hasn't been posted at the hall with regard to some of their physical deposits and or things that are in transit.

2375
04:05:19,228 --> 04:05:21,370
a good handle on what the activity is.

2376
04:05:22,250 --> 04:05:30,556
So also provided is the, again, the large packet is from our facility scheduler.

2377
04:05:30,676 --> 04:05:35,920
It's an online product that is maintained by Rachel Perry.

2378
04:05:35,940 --> 04:05:37,201
That's a huge undertaking.

2379
04:05:37,301 --> 04:05:46,067
So as you can imagine, all of these items had to be hand-keyed by each school and each activity level.

2380
04:05:46,187 --> 04:05:47,628
So there's a significant amount

2381
04:05:48,348 --> 04:05:53,613
maintenance that goes into these and oversight for all of these programs under community schools.

2382
04:05:55,114 --> 04:05:57,977
So these community schools are revolving accounts.

2383
04:05:58,037 --> 04:06:03,562
They have continuous activity, which rolls over year after year with any applicable fund balance.

2384
04:06:04,083 --> 04:06:13,492
Again, their mass general law intent is a self-supporting program, should have receipts and revenues to cover the related expenses.

2385
04:06:14,310 --> 04:06:20,672
And as a cost structure for nonprofit entities, it's considered a break-even model, if you will.

2386
04:06:20,772 --> 04:06:24,434
So your activities should support what you need to pay out.

2387
04:06:24,814 --> 04:06:31,396
However, there are unexpected issues that occur within a program area, just as there are within a general budget.

2388
04:06:31,876 --> 04:06:38,999
So there were some significant areas that had some high levels of maintenance and things of that sort.

2389
04:06:40,650 --> 04:06:52,755
So the intent of the program, again, is to provide services to the greater Medford community, engaging with parents, staff, and outside organizations to facilitate partnerships between the schools and our constituents.

2390
04:06:53,135 --> 04:07:02,379
So again, as we think of community schools, we think of the engagement with our parents, our community leaders, and the like.

2391
04:07:03,634 --> 04:07:12,579
So as we go through the additional by category, we first have the edgerly fields, and that's program number 321.

2392
04:07:13,479 --> 04:07:17,521
And the account purpose is to collect rental fees for the use of the fields.

2393
04:07:18,542 --> 04:07:29,208
There was a major renovation project for this, and so there is bond and interest payments that is automatically charged and absorbed.

2394
04:07:29,288 --> 04:07:30,288
And for this year, it was 90,500.

2395
04:07:32,217 --> 04:07:40,881
So against our operating receipts and expenditures, that program also absorbed that additional component.

2396
04:07:41,662 --> 04:07:54,908
But we have a balance in that account, roughly 43,000, and the spring is a very active rental season, so we anticipate additional expected growth in that fund balance for year-end through June.

2397
04:07:55,989 --> 04:07:57,649
Our athletic revolving program is 361.

2398
04:07:59,406 --> 04:08:06,848
Again, the account purpose for this program is for sport user fees and gate fees for all the various fall, winter, and spring sports.

2399
04:08:07,328 --> 04:08:18,812
I think it's important and noteworthy to identify that the athletic programs on both the general budget and the revolving account are significantly underfunded at this point in time.

2400
04:08:18,892 --> 04:08:29,035
We are in a new MIAA league, and there are significant costs that go with that, including transportation that takes us further up and down

2401
04:08:29,783 --> 04:08:35,448
the coast where the league that we used to be in was right in our backyard, Malden, Medford, and the like.

2402
04:08:35,609 --> 04:08:39,412
So we have some significant costs with the new league.

2403
04:08:39,432 --> 04:08:42,475
We also have additional coaching.

2404
04:08:42,535 --> 04:08:45,258
We have additional officials expense.

2405
04:08:45,678 --> 04:08:50,843
So this is a program area that struggles to sustain itself, so I think it's important

2406
04:08:51,617 --> 04:08:52,378
understand that.

2407
04:08:53,619 --> 04:09:03,987
While it currently shows an $8,000 deficit, many of the spring user fees have not yet been collected, and it's anticipated that we will break even at the year end.

2408
04:09:05,168 --> 04:09:17,978
Again, we are part of the Northeast Conference with 16 schools that go up the North Shore as far as Gloucester, and it has created additional burdens on our regular athletic accounts and impacts the revolving fund due to

2409
04:09:19,066 --> 04:09:21,787
some low home team attendance for gate receipts and the like.

2410
04:09:23,587 --> 04:09:39,630
So moving forward into our community schools, the community schools is the revolving program 362, which its account purpose is to collect rental fees for use of facilities at all buildings, the high school and all of the outside schools.

2411
04:09:40,470 --> 04:09:45,311
While this program shows a deficit of roughly $29,778, we have many annual rental fees

2412
04:09:48,288 --> 04:10:02,557
that have not been collected, such as our AIC rental here at the high school, Tibetans, a new renter for the Redemption Church, as well as some summer camp deposits that we would anticipate a break-even status for year-end.

2413
04:10:03,518 --> 04:10:14,185
Our community schools engage many participants, ranging from the Japanese language school, some not-for-profit recreation groups, independent functions and the like that truly enhance the community involvement.

2414
04:10:14,700 --> 04:10:24,423
And I would guess that in your interactions with your constituents that they always have good things to say about the extracurricular events that take place at all of our buildings.

2415
04:10:24,523 --> 04:10:30,085
And this is where those funds are received and the expenses are taken out.

2416
04:10:30,145 --> 04:10:35,906
And that includes for the summer fun camp and the vacation camps as well.

2417
04:10:37,607 --> 04:10:44,389
The Loconte Rink is a revolving program 365 whose account purpose collects the rental fees for the use of the ice rink.

2418
04:10:45,419 --> 04:10:47,400
The rink shows a fund deficit of $79,000.

2419
04:10:48,041 --> 04:10:57,888
However, we do have revenues that are outstanding, totaling $73,600 that will bring the program toward a break-even status at year end.

2420
04:10:58,488 --> 04:11:03,332
Again, this is a difficult area to project out and maintain.

2421
04:11:03,352 --> 04:11:12,458
There's a significant amount of maintenance that goes into this facility with the ice and utilities that it costs to run and keep the facility cold.

2422
04:11:13,243 --> 04:11:17,206
So there are significant costs that will impact that program area.

2423
04:11:18,467 --> 04:11:27,595
The swimming pool is program 631, whose purpose is for the use of the pool by community groups, individuals, and the like.

2424
04:11:28,656 --> 04:11:40,606
The pool has sustained significant unpredictable charges this year, including $13,000 for the lane and motor repairs, as well as a spike in the custodial overtime due to the

2425
04:11:41,802 --> 04:11:43,583
unexpected security component.

2426
04:11:44,223 --> 04:11:59,870
So the pool shows an approximate deficit of 44,000, but we do have 8,800 in physical deposits that are in transit that we are researching with the hall, and we do have the spring months coming up that do provide more pool activity.

2427
04:12:00,750 --> 04:12:07,113
People see the sunshine, they get excited, they want to swim, they want to use the pool for upcoming birthday parties and the like.

2428
04:12:08,945 --> 04:12:33,595
So it is also noteworthy that the pool, when it was brought back online, that it may not generate the highest level of revenue, but it is an important offering to the community recreation department, and there's substantial use during the open swim hours, and I think that's important to share that you do have people from the community using the pool during those additional hours.

2429
04:12:35,197 --> 04:12:45,485
So from the words of our committee member, DiBenedetto, it's not necessarily what we want to hear, but this is the truth here this evening on the community schools.

2430
04:12:45,585 --> 04:12:54,832
So we are going in with our best foot forward and collect everything that we possibly can and hope to break even on all of these accounts.

2431
04:12:58,595 --> 04:12:58,995
Thank you.

2432
04:13:01,237 --> 04:13:04,900
So I went by each item.

2433
04:13:05,705 --> 04:13:08,007
I found it easy to do it that way.

2434
04:13:08,408 --> 04:13:16,335
So with Edgerly Field, I took the total deposits of $142,374.50, and then the expenses that were listed were $162,916, which means a difference of $20,000, a little bit more, in the red.

2435
04:13:33,540 --> 04:13:35,902
but we had money in the account prior to that, right?

2436
04:13:36,302 --> 04:13:38,364
So we're not really in the red in that thing.

2437
04:13:38,804 --> 04:13:42,967
Does that include the bond and the insurance?

2438
04:13:43,588 --> 04:13:45,149
Because I know- The bond and the interest, yes.

2439
04:13:45,169 --> 04:13:46,210
Yes, that includes everything.

2440
04:13:46,230 --> 04:13:46,630
The 90,000, yes.

2441
04:13:46,710 --> 04:13:52,415
I know a few years ago we got into a little trouble with that and the city helped us out and I'm glad to see that added in.

2442
04:13:52,515 --> 04:13:52,715
Yes.

2443
04:13:52,815 --> 04:13:54,156
I just want to say thank you for that.

2444
04:13:56,178 --> 04:14:02,903
I just want to make sure that the revenue coming in, that we're really having everybody pay for all the things.

2445
04:14:04,267 --> 04:14:10,951
I'd also like to see the personnel in the payroll issues listed when we get these reports.

2446
04:14:12,391 --> 04:14:16,133
I know that's a lot and I don't know if that's easy to do or not easy to do.

2447
04:14:17,934 --> 04:14:20,275
And I got the usage, that was my other note.

2448
04:14:20,916 --> 04:14:27,159
You provided us with the usage of who's on Edgeley Field as well as any buildings, right?

2449
04:14:27,419 --> 04:14:27,799
Correct.

2450
04:14:27,999 --> 04:14:28,239
Okay.

2451
04:14:30,783 --> 04:14:38,927
And you know what I really was hoping to see in part of this is donations of use time on our fields.

2452
04:14:39,127 --> 04:14:52,614
Like a list of people in the community, we donate time on the fields, on our buildings, because that's a PR thing, like we care about the community, we donate.

2453
04:14:52,774 --> 04:14:59,697
I know Mr. Maloney definitely provides many people in our community time,

2454
04:15:00,057 --> 04:15:05,661
to use our facilities and donated, and that was part of the computer program that I had hoped we would get that.

2455
04:15:06,021 --> 04:15:06,882
And maybe that's in that.

2456
04:15:06,942 --> 04:15:08,843
I just haven't had a chance tonight.

2457
04:15:08,883 --> 04:15:11,385
There's been so many goings on to read this.

2458
04:15:12,066 --> 04:15:20,892
So maybe someone could clarify that for me if that's in this or how that's being tracked, because that was requested a couple times throughout the years.

2459
04:15:21,717 --> 04:15:30,964
If I can respond, as we reviewed all of the data and information, I did not come across a significant amount of donated time.

2460
04:15:31,345 --> 04:15:33,406
As you can see, the schedule is quite booked.

2461
04:15:33,887 --> 04:15:41,833
So the majority of our usage is through a true facility rental and paid accordingly.

2462
04:15:42,293 --> 04:15:44,835
Okay.

2463
04:15:45,136 --> 04:15:50,600
Just in general in the future, I mean, people tell me all the time about different things going on

2464
04:15:52,004 --> 04:15:57,506
I don't see some of those things listed, so that's why I thought they were more of donation.

2465
04:15:57,846 --> 04:16:01,007
So we can move on to the athletic revenue expenses.

2466
04:16:01,907 --> 04:16:09,610
So I just wanted to be forthright and clear, the income for the athletics department was $81,974.25, and the expenses were $93,044.78, so the difference there is $11,000

2467
04:16:20,969 --> 04:16:26,155
but that's not the end of the year, like you said, the gate things.

2468
04:16:26,636 --> 04:16:39,972
And as far as employees for the athletics department, they're usually under the school employee people and not generally listed under athletics in this capacity.

2469
04:16:40,259 --> 04:16:43,780
Right, for coaching and the like, those are a budgeted item.

2470
04:16:43,840 --> 04:16:46,820
Right, just getting through it all.

2471
04:16:47,240 --> 04:16:48,501
And then community schools.

2472
04:16:48,981 --> 04:16:51,541
So this is the biggest amounts.

2473
04:16:54,662 --> 04:17:09,025
So my first question is AIC, Japanese schools, the church, those ones that you listed, we don't know what those amounts are, and we also don't know when those payments are coming in.

2474
04:17:09,440 --> 04:17:11,181
Could you provide us some of the information?

2475
04:17:11,261 --> 04:17:13,443
They had not been issued as of this time.

2476
04:17:13,503 --> 04:17:21,368
Again, as indicated, they're an annual rental invoice, so those are just being produced and going out shortly.

2477
04:17:21,388 --> 04:17:33,216
Do you mind just telling us an update as those go out, so just like when they went out, how much they're being charged, and how that affects their budget.

2478
04:17:33,456 --> 04:17:35,538
Also, the community school's income is 201,146.41,

2479
04:17:39,120 --> 04:17:44,362
The expenses here are only $18,310.08, if I did my numbers right.

2480
04:17:45,383 --> 04:17:52,226
So the total income is $191,836, is that correct?

2481
04:17:53,107 --> 04:17:57,148
The item that's not listed for community schools expense is their payroll.

2482
04:17:59,049 --> 04:18:01,150
So that would be an additional component.

2483
04:18:01,551 --> 04:18:03,011
That does not include the payroll?

2484
04:18:03,271 --> 04:18:03,431
No.

2485
04:18:04,352 --> 04:18:04,552
All right.

2486
04:18:05,258 --> 04:18:08,260
Could we get that number when we get the updated list of people?

2487
04:18:08,440 --> 04:18:09,281
That would be helpful.

2488
04:18:09,481 --> 04:18:12,623
And maybe just add it to this so we see it all at one time.

2489
04:18:13,103 --> 04:18:13,704
That would be great.

2490
04:18:14,784 --> 04:18:15,865
Moving forward.

2491
04:18:20,308 --> 04:18:32,456
I also thought that there was a theater group that was using the high school theater at the same time that the high school musical was trying to be put on, because I think they rented it, or I don't know if it was donated,

2492
04:18:32,890 --> 04:18:37,273
I think some of our other members' children were in that program, so I don't know the name of it.

2493
04:18:37,653 --> 04:18:42,116
There was a theater group that was being, they were practicing up at the high school.

2494
04:18:42,657 --> 04:18:44,318
Mr. Belson, do you know about that?

2495
04:18:49,161 --> 04:18:51,062
But their practices were at the same time.

2496
04:18:52,803 --> 04:18:53,884
Oh, okay.

2497
04:18:54,785 --> 04:18:58,527
Oh, there was some production up at the high school using the theater.

2498
04:19:01,569 --> 04:19:02,670
Was it an Arlington group?

2499
04:19:06,211 --> 04:19:06,771
Oh, it wasn't.

2500
04:19:09,192 --> 04:19:20,955
So there was an Arlington group that using the Karen Theater, and I'm assuming that they rented it out, and there were conflict in timing.

2501
04:19:24,715 --> 04:19:33,157
We got an email about this, Mr. Maloney, about the high school kids when they were, a parent sent it to us.

2502
04:19:33,197 --> 04:19:34,398
Bobby Maloney, 61 Sheridan Ave, Medford.

2503
04:19:36,036 --> 04:19:51,026
I talked to an individual, I talked to Mayor, the way the little theater rental works, Tony Shashikni, Dr. Perella, Aaron Keith, Sarah Grant, they give us their dates they want, then we go to the public.

2504
04:19:51,846 --> 04:20:05,175
What happened was, I believe, I think it was Sarah Grant, changed her dates, and the Islington group had the theater booked, so they already had a contract, they paid, and they paid handsomely, by the way.

2505
04:20:06,320 --> 04:20:14,703
So I spoke to one of the parents at Method High School and I said, you can come into my office, you can look at the way we do the, and she was very happy with the phone call.

2506
04:20:15,523 --> 04:20:15,924
Oh, okay.

2507
04:20:16,024 --> 04:20:17,864
Thank you for reaching out to that parent.

2508
04:20:17,884 --> 04:20:18,545
I appreciate it.

2509
04:20:19,065 --> 04:20:20,505
Um, what Arlington group is that?

2510
04:20:20,525 --> 04:20:24,667
Cause I don't see it listed as, um, on the community school rental.

2511
04:20:24,707 --> 04:20:26,307
I'll be happy to email you in the morning.

2512
04:20:27,308 --> 04:20:27,548
Okay.

2513
04:20:33,315 --> 04:20:36,677
I want to say it was the troublemakers.

2514
04:20:37,837 --> 04:20:38,477
It was a play.

2515
04:20:39,658 --> 04:20:43,119
I can get you the information in a moment.

2516
04:20:44,780 --> 04:20:45,060
Okay.

2517
04:20:46,521 --> 04:20:47,941
I'd appreciate that very much.

2518
04:20:48,021 --> 04:20:48,421
Thank you.

2519
04:20:48,602 --> 04:20:55,044
And so with what was presented, there is the $191,836 in this area, and other than the personnel.

2520
04:21:02,228 --> 04:21:02,788
personnel.

2521
04:21:03,449 --> 04:21:04,410
We'll come back to it.

2522
04:21:04,750 --> 04:21:05,771
We'll come back to this.

2523
04:21:06,872 --> 04:21:10,975
We'll just table it until we get that additional information.

2524
04:21:11,676 --> 04:21:12,797
I'm almost done, sorry.

2525
04:21:14,939 --> 04:21:16,820
The La Conte rank, the income is $157,600.

2526
04:21:17,341 --> 04:21:18,822
I'm having trouble reading my writing this late.

2527
04:21:18,842 --> 04:21:19,923
And the expenses are $227,049.63 with

2528
04:21:32,595 --> 04:21:33,175
a difference of $69,449.

2529
04:21:33,756 --> 04:21:40,859
I know that this is a benefit to have a rink in our community.

2530
04:21:43,060 --> 04:21:55,385
I don't know if we can advertise more rink time or how we can help change that deficit, and maybe it will change by the end of this 17?

2531
04:21:55,425 --> 04:21:58,367
Okay.

2532
04:22:00,348 --> 04:22:00,828
Okay, great.

2533
04:22:01,738 --> 04:22:06,959
And the last one is the pool, which is income of $149,025.50 and expenses of $173,657 with a difference of $24,600.

2534
04:22:07,059 --> 04:22:10,040
And I don't think that's terrible considering all the extra security over time.

2535
04:22:10,080 --> 04:22:11,220
Was that allocated to the pool?

2536
04:22:11,240 --> 04:22:11,360
Yes.

2537
04:22:28,488 --> 04:22:35,690
So I think that's pretty good because we knew when we opened those pools that it was going to be a tight thing because of the cost of running a pool.

2538
04:22:36,251 --> 04:22:43,073
So, and I think it's a value to our students and to the community, well worth the investment.

2539
04:22:43,513 --> 04:22:46,374
I just want to thank you for providing me with these reports.

2540
04:22:46,774 --> 04:22:50,255
And if you could follow up with those few questions, I'd appreciate it.

2541
04:22:50,795 --> 04:22:54,177
And thank you for staying so late to answer some of these questions.

2542
04:22:54,317 --> 04:22:55,477
I really do appreciate it.

2543
04:22:56,478 --> 04:22:58,840
having a good understanding of this area.

2544
04:22:59,220 --> 04:23:02,343
So any extra money, how is that allocated?

2545
04:23:02,403 --> 04:23:03,163
Where does it go to?

2546
04:23:03,183 --> 04:23:05,826
Okay.

2547
04:23:07,167 --> 04:23:10,589
So do we have a balance in that account?

2548
04:23:11,510 --> 04:23:13,071
No, this is the report for you.

2549
04:23:13,111 --> 04:23:15,053
These are the balances as of right now.

2550
04:23:15,673 --> 04:23:22,779
We have two months remaining that we're hoping to maximize our collections and get to a break-even point.

2551
04:23:24,641 --> 04:23:24,821
Yes.

2552
04:23:30,538 --> 04:23:31,119
just real quick.

2553
04:23:31,299 --> 04:23:36,883
On the annual rental fees, I guess it makes me a little nervous that we only collect them once a year.

2554
04:23:38,484 --> 04:23:42,647
Can we insist that they be paid twice?

2555
04:23:44,969 --> 04:23:49,713
Because if one of these goes out of business or something like that, we could really be left holding

2556
04:23:52,289 --> 04:24:02,715
I don't know how much each of these, AIC, Tibetans, Redemption Church, I don't know how much they pay us, but I'm just concerned that maybe going forward it would be a better idea to collect.

2557
04:24:03,396 --> 04:24:05,817
Certainly, that's part of the review of the contracts.

2558
04:24:05,877 --> 04:24:12,742
Again, this was in place, so following that protocol has been an annual invoice.

2559
04:24:12,962 --> 04:24:13,522
When are they due?

2560
04:24:14,323 --> 04:24:14,723
I'm sorry?

2561
04:24:14,743 --> 04:24:15,644
When is the payment due?

2562
04:24:16,324 --> 04:24:17,125
Before the end of June.

2563
04:24:18,308 --> 04:24:22,132
It just makes me a little nervous.

2564
04:24:22,172 --> 04:24:35,424
The concern or the issue with some of the groups is that if they don't have their utilization at the end or if there was correction in dates or times, they want to have that flexibility to be able to review and

2565
04:24:36,516 --> 04:24:43,219
identified for the last couple of months because we're pre-billing in that respect for the last couple of months.

2566
04:24:43,239 --> 04:24:43,559
Right.

2567
04:24:43,799 --> 04:24:55,945
But I guess I'm just suggesting a twice a year collection as opposed to... Again, these were contracts in place, so I didn't have that option.

2568
04:24:56,205 --> 04:24:59,806
So I think that's something moving forward we can review with each of the groups.

2569
04:25:00,046 --> 04:25:00,267
Okay.

2570
04:25:00,347 --> 04:25:00,627
Thank you.

2571
04:25:10,033 --> 04:25:10,955
Great, thank you.

2572
04:25:10,975 --> 04:25:14,400
Great, thank you.

2573
04:25:52,036 --> 04:25:52,637
We have a motion and a second.

2574
04:25:52,657 --> 04:25:53,238
We have a motion and a second.

2575
04:25:53,258 --> 04:25:53,838
We have a motion and a second.

2576
04:25:53,858 --> 04:25:54,439
We have a motion and a second.
