1
00:38:21,578 --> 00:38:28,259
[SPEAKER_32]: Can I just add, we have two other students here tonight that actually were the masterminds behind the video, Abigail Brady and Kayla Velmay.

2
00:38:28,779 --> 00:38:29,519
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

3
00:38:43,482 --> 00:38:46,423
[SPEAKER_24]: Thanks for helping Christina do her amazing project.

4
00:38:47,483 --> 00:38:47,943
[SPEAKER_24]: Nice job.

5
00:38:55,615 --> 00:38:56,095
[SPEAKER_24]: Also, Ms.

6
00:38:56,316 --> 00:38:59,659
[SPEAKER_24]: Vandekluw, while we're under suspension, did you want to speak on this a lot?

7
00:39:03,242 --> 00:39:05,344
[SPEAKER_24]: That was part of the... Who made the puppet, Christina?

8
00:39:06,506 --> 00:39:07,887
[SPEAKER_22]: That was part of the program.

9
00:39:08,628 --> 00:39:09,609
[SPEAKER_22]: Did you guys make that?

10
00:39:09,629 --> 00:39:11,991
[SPEAKER_22]: We had it in the program.

11
00:39:13,172 --> 00:39:13,452
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

12
00:39:13,653 --> 00:39:15,234
[SPEAKER_22]: I also want to comment on...

13
00:39:16,574 --> 00:39:21,677
[SPEAKER_22]: These are fairly new programs within the method public schools and the vocational schools.

14
00:39:21,997 --> 00:39:36,285
[SPEAKER_22]: And we have machinery in there that labs at the Broad Institute have, and that Tufts University even comes down and uses and teaches us children with.

15
00:39:36,785 --> 00:39:42,408
[SPEAKER_22]: We give our students excellent opportunities, and I'm so happy.

16
00:39:42,979 --> 00:39:49,122
[SPEAKER_22]: to see this move forward and to see the collaboration amongst different programs.

17
00:39:49,882 --> 00:39:53,684
[SPEAKER_22]: I could not be prouder of our teachers and our students.

18
00:39:54,024 --> 00:39:55,885
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you for representing Method so well.

19
00:40:03,459 --> 00:40:03,579
[SPEAKER_14]: Ms.

20
00:40:03,619 --> 00:40:04,159
[SPEAKER_14]: Van der Kloot?

21
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:11,143
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, Mayor Burke, while we're under suspension, I ask that we bring up the Medford Teachers Association next.

22
00:40:11,183 --> 00:40:14,645
[SPEAKER_14]: They've asked if we could move them up.

23
00:40:15,385 --> 00:40:17,246
[SPEAKER_24]: They're under community participation?

24
00:40:17,286 --> 00:40:17,446
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

25
00:40:17,466 --> 00:40:20,408
[SPEAKER_24]: Is there a member from the Medford Teachers Association that would like to address Ms.

26
00:40:20,428 --> 00:40:21,429
[SPEAKER_24]: Charlene Douglas?

27
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:35,510
[SPEAKER_24]: Good evening.

28
00:40:35,811 --> 00:40:37,332
[SPEAKER_24]: Your name and address, please, for our record?

29
00:40:37,392 --> 00:40:38,513
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes, she needs her glasses.

30
00:40:38,873 --> 00:40:41,615
[SPEAKER_26]: Charlene Douglas, 414 High Street, Medford, Massachusetts.

31
00:40:41,875 --> 00:40:44,477
[SPEAKER_26]: And Gina Coppola, 54 Yeomans Ave, Medford, Mass.

32
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,822
[SPEAKER_26]: And I am president of the Medford Teacher Association.

33
00:40:51,682 --> 00:41:00,589
[SPEAKER_26]: And I'm president of the Paraprofessional Association, standing here to let you know that our association wholeheartedly agrees with what you are about to hear from the MTA.

34
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:02,711
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

35
00:41:03,451 --> 00:41:03,812
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

36
00:41:04,012 --> 00:41:04,312
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

37
00:41:04,786 --> 00:41:10,749
[SPEAKER_26]: So many people have come to me in the past two weeks concerned about Mr. Bellson's employment.

38
00:41:11,229 --> 00:41:14,691
[SPEAKER_26]: That is not the reason why we are here tonight.

39
00:41:15,731 --> 00:41:21,294
[SPEAKER_26]: We have no interest in his employment, and you will hear soon what we are concerned about.

40
00:41:22,775 --> 00:41:30,759
[SPEAKER_26]: At this point, I'd like to ask all the members of the Medford Teacher Association, McGlynn School, and the Medford Paraprofessional Association to stand.

41
00:41:33,578 --> 00:41:34,718
[SPEAKER_26]: and many are standing in back.

42
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:48,522
[SPEAKER_26]: So tonight, I am here to speak on behalf of all the teachers at the McGlynn Middle School and on behalf of educators everywhere who stand up for themselves and their students.

43
00:41:49,242 --> 00:42:01,805
[SPEAKER_26]: I am referring specifically to statements made by Superintendent Belson to the Method Police as reported by Captain Kevin M. Fahler in the McGlynn School Investigation Report.

44
00:42:02,205 --> 00:42:02,825
[SPEAKER_26]: dated April 6, 2018.

45
00:42:04,046 --> 00:42:17,189
[SPEAKER_26]: I hope you are all as troubled as we are by the inconsistencies in the poor judgment documented in the report and by the unanswered questions that still remain.

46
00:42:17,969 --> 00:42:24,831
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm going to confine my remarks to our deep concerns about statements made by Mr. Belson concerning teachers.

47
00:42:25,691 --> 00:42:31,113
[SPEAKER_26]: Let's begin with the statement by Mr. Belson in response to questions about why he didn't report

48
00:42:31,503 --> 00:42:33,924
[SPEAKER_26]: the discovery of the gun clip to the police.

49
00:42:34,705 --> 00:42:41,108
[SPEAKER_26]: On page 24 of the report, he is quoted as saying, rightly or wrongly, I didn't see it as a danger.

50
00:42:41,789 --> 00:42:50,414
[SPEAKER_26]: The report goes on to say, Mr. Bellson stated that after he got busy and quote, really did not deal with it, unquote.

51
00:42:50,994 --> 00:42:57,938
[SPEAKER_26]: Mr. Bellson stated that Mr. Edwards is also quote, under a great deal of fire by his faculty

52
00:42:58,516 --> 00:43:09,038
[SPEAKER_26]: unquote, and that Mr. Belson currently has an, that Mr. Edwards, excuse me, and that Mr. Edwards currently has an MCAD case and an arbitration case against him.

53
00:43:09,678 --> 00:43:15,679
[SPEAKER_26]: Mr. Belson stated that his faculty is angry at him, quote, not happy with us at all.

54
00:43:16,359 --> 00:43:24,101
[SPEAKER_26]: Mr. Belson then reportedly thought to himself, quote, this doesn't seem like it should be elevated.

55
00:43:24,538 --> 00:43:27,039
[SPEAKER_26]: You know one more thing, unquote.

56
00:43:27,799 --> 00:43:28,960
[SPEAKER_26]: Let's reflect on this.

57
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:40,044
[SPEAKER_26]: Mr. Belson is telling the police that he decided to downplay the incident to protect Mr. Edwards because members of Mr. Edwards' staff have taken legal action against him.

58
00:43:40,444 --> 00:43:52,228
[SPEAKER_26]: This sends the message that when teachers use the proper legal channels to seek redress of grievances and improvements in teaching and learning conditions in their school, the administration may actually conceal information

59
00:43:52,585 --> 00:43:54,446
[SPEAKER_26]: that could threaten the safety of our schools.

60
00:43:55,126 --> 00:44:00,327
[SPEAKER_26]: That thought process, as described to the police, is very disturbing, but it gets worse.

61
00:44:00,867 --> 00:44:06,169
[SPEAKER_26]: I will now read to you from a selection from the section of the report starting at the bottom of page 25.

62
00:44:07,289 --> 00:44:13,151
[SPEAKER_26]: Mr. Belson stated, quote, I don't know if there's some sort of political setup here to get Jake.

63
00:44:13,691 --> 00:44:15,932
[SPEAKER_26]: Jake is under a bit of fire, unquote.

64
00:44:16,552 --> 00:44:17,392
[SPEAKER_26]: He reiterated,

65
00:44:17,748 --> 00:44:20,712
[SPEAKER_26]: that Mr. Edwards does not get along with some of his teachers.

66
00:44:21,112 --> 00:44:24,436
[SPEAKER_26]: He added that, quote, Jake is a decent human being.

67
00:44:24,777 --> 00:44:26,199
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't see him doing that.

68
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:29,583
[SPEAKER_26]: That is knowingly throwing away a gun magazine.

69
00:44:30,023 --> 00:44:30,724
[SPEAKER_26]: I just don't.

70
00:44:31,245 --> 00:44:31,986
[SPEAKER_26]: Was he set up?

71
00:44:32,506 --> 00:44:34,168
[SPEAKER_26]: Were they really trying to get him?

72
00:44:34,809 --> 00:44:35,230
[SPEAKER_26]: Unquote.

73
00:44:36,176 --> 00:44:45,601
[SPEAKER_26]: Mr. Belson is posing a theory to the police that the McGlynn teachers, who do not get along with Mr. Edwards, may have set him up to try and get rid of him.

74
00:44:46,121 --> 00:44:50,744
[SPEAKER_26]: That is the most outrageous, insulting, and implausible theory I have ever heard.

75
00:44:51,264 --> 00:44:56,827
[SPEAKER_26]: It is also a clear attempt to deflect blame from himself and Mr. Edwards onto the teachers.

76
00:44:57,828 --> 00:44:59,168
[SPEAKER_26]: Let me say this clearly.

77
00:44:59,729 --> 00:45:02,850
[SPEAKER_26]: The teachers and other staff at the McGlynn are not to blame.

78
00:45:03,291 --> 00:45:05,932
[SPEAKER_26]: In fact, they actually could have been victims.

79
00:45:06,358 --> 00:45:12,380
[SPEAKER_26]: along with their students if the loaded magazine had been placed in the auditorium for malicious purposes.

80
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:24,303
[SPEAKER_26]: For Mr. Belson to suggest that the gun clip incident may have been a setup by teachers who don't like Mr. Edwards is disappointing, discouraging, upsetting, disheartening, and false.

81
00:45:25,184 --> 00:45:30,385
[SPEAKER_26]: In fact, that's how the McGlynn teachers feel this year, disappointed, discouraged, and disheartened.

82
00:45:31,025 --> 00:45:31,926
[SPEAKER_26]: Here's the reality.

83
00:45:32,546 --> 00:45:35,947
[SPEAKER_26]: The teachers at the McGlynn School have been working under adverse conditions

84
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:47,076
[SPEAKER_26]: Conditions that led them to come up with their own school improvement proposal called the ABC plan that has constantly ignored through the fall and into the winter of the school year until Mayor Burke took it on.

85
00:45:47,736 --> 00:45:52,839
[SPEAKER_26]: Despite these conditions, the McGlynn teachers have never stopped doing what's right for their students.

86
00:45:53,440 --> 00:46:06,187
[SPEAKER_26]: Following me, you will hear from our McGlynn teachers about how they contribute to the school, the Medford public school systems, and the community as a whole, even through years of lacking leadership, vision, and support.

87
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:13,622
[SPEAKER_26]: They are hopeful for change and grateful for the current principal who is in place now and proving to be a strong leader.

88
00:46:14,422 --> 00:46:21,324
[SPEAKER_26]: Before I turn the floor over to the teachers, I want to tell you that we are asking for in no uncertain terms.

89
00:46:21,965 --> 00:46:25,146
[SPEAKER_26]: First, we demand a public apology from Mr. Belshen.

90
00:46:25,586 --> 00:46:29,467
[SPEAKER_26]: He should apologize for downplaying the gun clip incident in order to protect

91
00:46:29,832 --> 00:46:43,340
[SPEAKER_26]: Mr. Edwards from criticism as he admitted to the police, and he should apologize by making that suggestion, obviously without a shred of evidence, that somehow teachers were behind the gun clip incident to make Mr. Edwards look bad.

92
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:58,568
[SPEAKER_26]: Second, we want to be assured that the school committee does not share the negative opinions about the McGlynn staff that Mr. Belson stated to the police, and we ask that you make a public statement voicing support for the educators in the McGlynn

93
00:46:58,905 --> 00:47:03,727
[SPEAKER_26]: and indicating that these words are his own and are not shared by the Medford School Committee.

94
00:47:04,147 --> 00:47:04,548
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

95
00:47:04,888 --> 00:47:07,889
[SPEAKER_26]: At this point, I invite Brian Villard up to the mic.

96
00:47:11,551 --> 00:47:12,671
[SPEAKER_26]: And other teachers from McGlynn.

97
00:47:14,212 --> 00:47:16,633
[SPEAKER_27]: Brian Villard, 716 Main Street in Boxford.

98
00:47:17,473 --> 00:47:18,354
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you, Charlene.

99
00:47:18,534 --> 00:47:20,195
[SPEAKER_27]: As always, we appreciate your support.

100
00:47:20,875 --> 00:47:23,596
[SPEAKER_27]: Good evening, Honorable Mayor Burke and members of the school committee.

101
00:47:24,096 --> 00:47:27,278
[SPEAKER_27]: We are the teachers of McGlynn, and we're here because we care.

102
00:47:28,655 --> 00:47:34,218
[SPEAKER_27]: First and foremost, we'd like to say thank you to those of you who have heard our concerns and have truly listened to us.

103
00:47:34,699 --> 00:47:37,280
[SPEAKER_27]: There has been so much positive in the school this year.

104
00:47:37,921 --> 00:47:41,663
[SPEAKER_27]: We are encouraged by all of your efforts to help our school continually improve.

105
00:47:42,264 --> 00:47:47,927
[SPEAKER_27]: We also appreciate your recognition of the wonderful community the teachers and staff have created at the McGlynn.

106
00:47:48,648 --> 00:47:53,070
[SPEAKER_27]: However, we felt that the allegations in the police report could not go unrefuted.

107
00:47:53,811 --> 00:47:55,712
[SPEAKER_27]: McGlynn teachers were extremely shaken

108
00:47:56,097 --> 00:47:59,380
[SPEAKER_27]: and disappointed when we read some of the comments contained within it.

109
00:48:00,341 --> 00:48:03,444
[SPEAKER_27]: We honestly don't know how exactly to respond.

110
00:48:04,385 --> 00:48:05,786
[SPEAKER_27]: We feel misrepresented.

111
00:48:06,687 --> 00:48:12,273
[SPEAKER_27]: So we thought what better way to clear the air than by telling you a little bit about what we have been doing with our time.

112
00:48:12,955 --> 00:48:17,576
[SPEAKER_27]: Teachers have been working hard all year, both in and out of school, to educate the youth of Medford.

113
00:48:18,377 --> 00:48:24,759
[SPEAKER_27]: We have stayed positive and focused our innovations on innovations and solutions to make our building better.

114
00:48:25,499 --> 00:48:34,422
[SPEAKER_27]: This year, personally, I stepped up and joined the McGlynn site council, working with administration, faculty, parents, and students to propose positive change.

115
00:48:35,402 --> 00:48:40,603
[SPEAKER_27]: I continued building school community by running the morning show program and highlighting the accomplishments of students.

116
00:48:41,423 --> 00:48:46,004
[SPEAKER_27]: And I worked with Angela Bellini to establish the first annual lip-sync competition.

117
00:48:53,766 --> 00:48:55,647
[SPEAKER_00]: Sherry Flint, Fay Street, Boston.

118
00:48:57,587 --> 00:49:05,592
[SPEAKER_00]: This year, I wanted to say that I volunteered to host two different programs outside to help our science department.

119
00:49:06,412 --> 00:49:12,095
[SPEAKER_00]: We hosted the Tufts biology department, and we also hosted Concord Consortium.

120
00:49:12,996 --> 00:49:24,703
[SPEAKER_00]: I volunteered to have these groups into my room to give my students an opportunity to experience hands-on activities and curriculum and work with materials that they wouldn't otherwise be able to have

121
00:49:25,627 --> 00:49:28,033
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something that was very important to me this year.

122
00:49:28,053 --> 00:49:31,141
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think our kids really benefited from that.

123
00:49:31,321 --> 00:49:31,582
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

124
00:49:37,377 --> 00:49:41,801
[SPEAKER_31]: Hi, I'm Amy Villard, 716 Main Street in Foxhurst, Massachusetts.

125
00:49:43,203 --> 00:49:44,624
[SPEAKER_31]: First of all, I love the McGlynn.

126
00:49:44,664 --> 00:49:45,945
[SPEAKER_31]: The McGlynn is my second home.

127
00:49:45,985 --> 00:49:47,187
[SPEAKER_31]: My best friends work here.

128
00:49:47,787 --> 00:49:49,809
[SPEAKER_31]: I love it so much that I married a teacher there.

129
00:49:51,811 --> 00:49:55,635
[SPEAKER_31]: But on top of that, I'm a sixth grade teacher, and I have an amazing team.

130
00:49:55,695 --> 00:50:00,359
[SPEAKER_31]: And I'm going to read a couple of testimonials, not just from me, but from a couple of other members of my team who aren't here tonight.

131
00:50:06,148 --> 00:50:16,177
[SPEAKER_31]: So some of the female sixth grade teachers on our floor in the springtime specifically, we work together to spend lunch with a group of sixth grade girls on Fridays in the spring.

132
00:50:16,277 --> 00:50:17,378
[SPEAKER_31]: Being a middle school girl,

133
00:50:17,898 --> 00:50:19,720
[SPEAKER_31]: As some of us know, it was really, really hard.

134
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:24,903
[SPEAKER_31]: We worked to help the 6th grade girls feel connected and supportive of each other by creating a safe space.

135
00:50:25,344 --> 00:50:30,748
[SPEAKER_31]: Each 6th grade girl receives a hand-delivered personal invitation to join us for a girls' lunch by the end of the school year.

136
00:50:31,068 --> 00:50:33,370
[SPEAKER_31]: This is an opportunity to celebrate all of our strong,

137
00:50:33,770 --> 00:50:34,831
[SPEAKER_31]: and smart girls.

138
00:50:35,211 --> 00:50:40,514
[SPEAKER_31]: Activities include I'm Awesome Because, goal setting, meeting new friends, and what it means to be a middle school girl.

139
00:50:41,655 --> 00:50:44,977
[SPEAKER_31]: Over the past five years, I've organized a running club for McGlynn students.

140
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:59,086
[SPEAKER_31]: Many of the kids at our schools don't have a ton of things to do after school that are productive, and the kids really enjoy being active, being outside, setting goals, achieving them, and they culminate in a cross-country race in the fall and a little track race in the spring.

141
00:51:01,173 --> 00:51:05,675
[SPEAKER_31]: This testimonial's from Michael Kremen, who's the sixth grade ELA teacher on my team.

142
00:51:06,696 --> 00:51:13,160
[SPEAKER_31]: Over the 13 years that I've worked at the McGlynn, my team and I have purchased many items for students who are living in difficult situations at home.

143
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:16,922
[SPEAKER_31]: We have brought students shoes, boots, coats, and other clothing.

144
00:51:17,382 --> 00:51:26,888
[SPEAKER_31]: This year, along with Miss Bradshaw, who's our school adjustment Councilor, we bought and collected dozens of winter coats, pairs of gloves, and mittens and hats for our students who did not have proper cold weather clothing.

145
00:51:27,369 --> 00:51:32,116
[SPEAKER_31]: I routinely purchase food and snacks for the nurses who have told us how many kids come to school hungry.

146
00:51:32,557 --> 00:51:33,859
[SPEAKER_31]: We do these things quietly.

147
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:35,502
[SPEAKER_31]: We are not seeking praise.

148
00:51:35,742 --> 00:51:37,906
[SPEAKER_31]: We do them because our students need them to be done.

149
00:51:38,813 --> 00:51:42,014
[SPEAKER_31]: And then finally, Mrs. Taylor, who's the science teacher on my team.

150
00:51:42,715 --> 00:51:50,218
[SPEAKER_31]: She works with Mrs. Trumbull and Mrs. Bellini to start the GEMS Club this year, which is Girls Exploring Math and Science.

151
00:51:50,618 --> 00:51:53,799
[SPEAKER_31]: It's a very unique club to get girls more interested in STEM fields.

152
00:51:54,099 --> 00:51:57,421
[SPEAKER_31]: We've been coming up with a curriculum and exciting activities to get the girls to come back.

153
00:51:57,861 --> 00:52:02,643
[SPEAKER_31]: We have a core group of about 10 students who have been with us since we started, and this includes a few students from the Andrews.

154
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:04,303
[SPEAKER_31]: We're excited to grow in the years to come.

155
00:52:04,984 --> 00:52:05,284
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

156
00:52:10,845 --> 00:52:14,767
[SPEAKER_34]: Hi, I'm Kristen Zeckman, 55 Dunboy Street, Boston.

157
00:52:15,608 --> 00:52:17,329
[SPEAKER_34]: And I teach eighth grade English.

158
00:52:18,109 --> 00:52:23,212
[SPEAKER_34]: And my goal as an English teacher is to get the kids to be more passionate about reading and writing.

159
00:52:23,693 --> 00:52:26,094
[SPEAKER_34]: And wherever they are, that's where I want to take them a step further.

160
00:52:26,254 --> 00:52:29,356
[SPEAKER_34]: And when we do this is through the Scholastic Writing Awards.

161
00:52:30,116 --> 00:52:33,018
[SPEAKER_34]: It's a big deal for a middle school student to win.

162
00:52:33,258 --> 00:52:38,341
[SPEAKER_34]: And throughout the past several years, we've had winners in the middle school level from the Midlands specifically.

163
00:52:39,802 --> 00:52:47,346
[SPEAKER_34]: And they often go on to win again in high school, and I think it's a great way for them to be recognized both locally and statewide.

164
00:52:47,366 --> 00:52:51,568
[SPEAKER_34]: I also wanted to mention something that my coworker, Brett, does.

165
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:52,469
[SPEAKER_34]: He's sitting over there.

166
00:52:52,869 --> 00:53:05,996
[SPEAKER_34]: He raises money through a GoFundMe site so that we can bring in an acting troupe for Romeo and Juliet and give the kids this authentic learning experience so that they can actually see the show in person, not just act it out in school and things.

167
00:53:06,056 --> 00:53:07,757
[SPEAKER_34]: So those are two examples.

168
00:53:07,857 --> 00:53:08,117
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you.

169
00:53:15,079 --> 00:53:15,439
[SPEAKER_01]: How you doing?

170
00:53:15,799 --> 00:53:17,620
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Ryan McCarthy, 46 Colonial Ave.

171
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:22,581
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, that was where I grew up, 176 Florence Road, Waltham.

172
00:53:23,181 --> 00:53:33,043
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been on staff at the McGlynn since 2004, and I'm very, very proud of my school, our school I should say, and all of the faculty that work there and the students and the work that they produce.

173
00:53:34,784 --> 00:53:40,065
[SPEAKER_01]: Each year since I've been at school, and I've taken many of your, a couple of your children anyhow on the trip,

174
00:53:41,093 --> 00:53:42,514
[SPEAKER_01]: we go on an environmental camp trip.

175
00:53:43,075 --> 00:53:44,856
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's run completely by teachers.

176
00:53:45,677 --> 00:53:49,419
[SPEAKER_01]: All teachers that attend the trip, you know, go, I think, above and beyond the call of duty.

177
00:53:49,499 --> 00:53:51,881
[SPEAKER_01]: We, you know, we don't go home to our families that night.

178
00:53:52,601 --> 00:53:58,966
[SPEAKER_01]: We create a very positive experience, a formative experience for the seventh graders each year.

179
00:53:59,126 --> 00:54:01,187
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've done it, as I've said, every single year that I've been there.

180
00:54:01,707 --> 00:54:09,833
[SPEAKER_01]: And we never have to take parent chaperones because we have, you know, hordes of teachers that are willing to step up and to do the right thing for the kids.

181
00:54:10,792 --> 00:54:21,265
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, beyond that, just quickly, each year, the Medford Family Network, which is an organization, very local, they're looking for charitable donations around Christmas time.

182
00:54:21,886 --> 00:54:26,932
[SPEAKER_01]: Mrs. Derding and others have organized this effort at our building, and each year, my homeroom

183
00:54:27,763 --> 00:54:36,626
[SPEAKER_01]: coordinate an effort, and this year we were able to adopt a family of three, three children that is, and provide them with, you know, over $400 worth of gifts at Christmastime.

184
00:54:37,106 --> 00:54:40,908
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, again, teachers stepping up, making donations, and also the students.

185
00:54:41,248 --> 00:54:42,528
[SPEAKER_01]: The teachers are motivating the students.

186
00:54:43,008 --> 00:54:43,909
[SPEAKER_01]: Very proud of the work we do.

187
00:54:50,831 --> 00:54:51,351
[SPEAKER_12]: Good evening.

188
00:54:51,412 --> 00:54:55,433
[SPEAKER_12]: My name is Patricia Kilbride, 11 Interville Street, Woburn, Massachusetts.

189
00:54:56,032 --> 00:55:08,519
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been a special education teacher in Medford for 11 years, first at the Columbus in the therapeutic learning program, and then I was brought to the McGlynn for the language base, and I now teach grades six, seven, and eight in combination classes.

190
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:12,281
[SPEAKER_12]: And I just have something to say from the special education teachers.

191
00:55:13,261 --> 00:55:25,248
[SPEAKER_12]: For the past three years, special education teachers and paraprofessionals from the language base, connections, and access programs have worked to include our students in the talent show, lip sync battle,

192
00:55:25,647 --> 00:55:31,069
[SPEAKER_12]: the New York trip, environmental camp, and other events.

193
00:55:31,569 --> 00:55:39,872
[SPEAKER_12]: Teachers, paraprofessionals, and parents have collaborated extensively to make these events fun and accessible to our students with special needs.

194
00:55:40,572 --> 00:55:48,835
[SPEAKER_12]: And I myself got to attend the New York trip last year with one of my students, and to see it through her eyes was phenomenal, and it was a great time.

195
00:55:49,195 --> 00:55:49,495
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

196
00:55:57,079 --> 00:55:57,579
[SPEAKER_28]: Good evening.

197
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:02,361
[SPEAKER_28]: My name's Hong Liu, H-O-N-G Liu, L-I-U.

198
00:56:02,981 --> 00:56:06,942
[SPEAKER_28]: I've been in the public school system, Medford Public School, for 25 years.

199
00:56:07,702 --> 00:56:13,184
[SPEAKER_28]: And for the past five years, I've been teaching as an ELL and math teacher.

200
00:56:14,264 --> 00:56:18,826
[SPEAKER_28]: All I can say is, McGlynn Middle School is one of the best.

201
00:56:20,326 --> 00:56:26,108
[SPEAKER_28]: The teachers are the most highly qualified, most hardworking,

202
00:56:26,816 --> 00:56:29,238
[SPEAKER_28]: teachers every single day.

203
00:56:30,779 --> 00:56:33,522
[SPEAKER_28]: This year, I happen to have a heavy load, so I work late.

204
00:56:33,982 --> 00:56:40,728
[SPEAKER_28]: Around 5, 6 o'clock, I still see many teachers working there, including Miss Robin Irving.

205
00:56:41,909 --> 00:56:47,914
[SPEAKER_28]: She is the first to be there getting the coffee for everyone, and she's almost the last one to leave.

206
00:56:48,414 --> 00:56:52,798
[SPEAKER_28]: Many teachers with their children, young children, they work there as if

207
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:55,101
[SPEAKER_28]: This is their family.

208
00:56:55,581 --> 00:56:59,123
[SPEAKER_28]: So I want to give a bigger applause to the teachers.

209
00:56:59,723 --> 00:57:19,955
[SPEAKER_28]: Also, I want to say, touched and inspired by the new principal, Mr. Nick Tucci, I helped

210
00:57:21,787 --> 00:57:34,255
[SPEAKER_28]: CQO received two Red Sox luxury suite tickets to help inspire students to be the best and achieve the best with the Mustang Way.

211
00:57:34,555 --> 00:57:34,875
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

212
00:57:34,995 --> 00:57:42,900
[SPEAKER_25]: All right.

213
00:57:42,940 --> 00:57:43,440
[SPEAKER_18]: Good evening.

214
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:46,602
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm Angela Bellini, 68 Glenwood Road, Somerville.

215
00:57:48,494 --> 00:57:51,175
[SPEAKER_18]: I've worked at the McGlynn Middle School for the past six years.

216
00:57:52,295 --> 00:57:55,876
[SPEAKER_18]: During this time, I've dedicated myself to the school and its students.

217
00:57:57,437 --> 00:58:11,621
[SPEAKER_18]: I've stayed late almost every single day, coming up with new, engaging, hands-on labs and activities that allow the children to not only have fun in science, but to access the science curriculum in a really dynamic way.

218
00:58:13,601 --> 00:58:16,682
[SPEAKER_18]: As Mrs. Taylor's testimonial mentioned earlier,

219
00:58:17,418 --> 00:58:28,384
[SPEAKER_18]: we piloted a new club called Gems to allow girls from both middle schools to explore and have fun in STEM fields through hands-on lessons.

220
00:58:31,045 --> 00:58:41,150
[SPEAKER_18]: This year, Mr. Villard and I also organized the McGlynn Middle School's first annual lip-sync battle, which allowed the students to have fun expressing themselves on stage and to compete for a trophy.

221
00:58:41,410 --> 00:58:42,271
[SPEAKER_18]: That was pretty awesome.

222
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:48,918
[SPEAKER_18]: For the past two years, I've also organized the environmental camp trip with help from Ms.

223
00:58:48,958 --> 00:58:49,319
[SPEAKER_18]: Haas.

224
00:58:50,359 --> 00:58:55,663
[SPEAKER_18]: And this trip has been recurring for the McGlynn 7th graders over the past 14 some odd years.

225
00:58:57,185 --> 00:59:02,188
[SPEAKER_18]: This trip becomes a lifelong memory for a lot of the kids, and it went really, really well last week.

226
00:59:02,889 --> 00:59:07,712
[SPEAKER_18]: I was really happy with the way that it turned out, and the kids, I asked them today, absolutely loved it.

227
00:59:07,812 --> 00:59:09,854
[SPEAKER_18]: So it was really, really great.

228
00:59:12,650 --> 00:59:29,244
[SPEAKER_18]: Lastly, myself and several other teachers spent countless hours after school, during vacations, and sometimes on weekends, putting together the thoughtful and comprehensive ABC plan, which was put together in response to the original McGlynn Action Plan that was brought forth to school committee earlier this school year.

229
00:59:30,965 --> 00:59:38,332
[SPEAKER_18]: We want our school to be the best that it can be for the sake of our community and the students that we teach, and that's why we do what we do.

230
00:59:39,833 --> 00:59:40,974
[SPEAKER_18]: We could go on and on.

231
00:59:41,622 --> 00:59:46,065
[SPEAKER_18]: about the positive works of our staff, but we don't want to take up all of your evening.

232
00:59:47,626 --> 00:59:53,910
[SPEAKER_18]: We encourage all of you to take the time to visit our school and to get to know the amazing staff at the McGlynn.

233
00:59:55,311 --> 01:00:04,297
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you so much for your time and for giving us the opportunity to express how much we care about our students, the school, and each other here at the McGlynn.

234
01:00:15,267 --> 01:00:16,207
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you for listening.

235
01:00:16,948 --> 01:00:17,628
[SPEAKER_26]: Have a nice evening.

236
01:00:18,248 --> 01:00:18,708
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

237
01:00:18,728 --> 01:00:23,610
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Paulson?

238
01:00:24,831 --> 01:00:39,977
[SPEAKER_29]: Mayor, members of the school committee, ladies and gentlemen, at no time have I ever said that the McGuinn was a bad school, that the McGuinn teachers did not accomplish things, that the McGuinn teachers didn't do a good day's work.

239
01:00:40,917 --> 01:00:42,458
[SPEAKER_29]: From time to time in my role,

240
01:00:42,934 --> 01:00:45,396
[SPEAKER_29]: Sure, I question certain things from time to time.

241
01:00:45,896 --> 01:00:46,577
[SPEAKER_29]: That's my job.

242
01:00:47,338 --> 01:00:48,699
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm supposed to ask questions.

243
01:00:49,079 --> 01:00:49,740
[SPEAKER_29]: That's what I do.

244
01:00:51,181 --> 01:00:57,866
[SPEAKER_29]: Now, when this situation took place, the one person who took the direct heat for it was me.

245
01:00:58,287 --> 01:01:03,951
[SPEAKER_29]: So the comment that I try to deflect the blame is clearly not true, and everyone knows it.

246
01:01:04,672 --> 01:01:06,353
[SPEAKER_29]: I didn't throw anyone else under the bus.

247
01:01:06,914 --> 01:01:10,917
[SPEAKER_29]: I took all the heat myself and accepted full responsibility for it.

248
01:01:12,490 --> 01:01:14,471
[SPEAKER_29]: Now, a police investigation is what it is.

249
01:01:15,432 --> 01:01:24,777
[SPEAKER_29]: People ask a lot of questions, and I was asked a lot of questions about a lot of possible scenarios, and what the climate was at that school, and what might be possible.

250
01:01:25,257 --> 01:01:28,138
[SPEAKER_29]: And if you read the report very carefully, you'll see there's a lot of gaps.

251
01:01:28,999 --> 01:01:31,120
[SPEAKER_29]: And some of those gaps do raise questions.

252
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:38,284
[SPEAKER_29]: And before I go on at this point, Mayor, I'd like to ask the police chief to come up and explain the nature of a police report

253
01:01:39,088 --> 01:01:43,369
[SPEAKER_29]: and to tell you that I answered questions that were put to me.

254
01:01:44,630 --> 01:01:51,572
[SPEAKER_29]: There are some people who declined to answer questions and declined to reveal things, but I didn't.

255
01:01:52,452 --> 01:01:53,492
[SPEAKER_29]: Chief, appreciate it.

256
01:01:57,974 --> 01:01:58,774
[SPEAKER_24]: Name and address, please.

257
01:01:59,754 --> 01:02:03,896
[SPEAKER_30]: I live at 227 Elm Street in Medford,

258
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:10,581
[SPEAKER_30]: Chief here in the City of Medford.

259
01:02:13,083 --> 01:02:15,884
[SPEAKER_30]: I just want to say one thing, if I may, Madam Chairman.

260
01:02:17,966 --> 01:02:20,087
[SPEAKER_30]: I've said it in a number of forums before.

261
01:02:20,867 --> 01:02:22,328
[SPEAKER_30]: The schools in Medford are safe.

262
01:02:23,409 --> 01:02:24,630
[SPEAKER_30]: That has to be loud and clear.

263
01:02:25,433 --> 01:02:43,066
[SPEAKER_30]: And they're safe, not by accident, they're safe because of all the people that are seated here tonight that work in those schools every single day, that keep a lid on things, they take care of business, they know who's causing a problem, they do what's appropriate to keep the schools safe.

264
01:02:43,526 --> 01:02:45,608
[SPEAKER_30]: They deserve an awful lot of credit.

265
01:02:53,594 --> 01:03:09,019
[SPEAKER_30]: And after this incident broke in February, when we first got the word at the police department about that, and then put a plan in place of how we were going to react from that point forward for a short period of time, I had the benefit of working a little bit at the McGlynn School.

266
01:03:09,899 --> 01:03:11,760
[SPEAKER_30]: And I saw the love

267
01:03:12,204 --> 01:03:19,086
[SPEAKER_30]: the care and the attention that the teaching staff give to every one of the children that enter that school every single day.

268
01:03:19,546 --> 01:03:23,447
[SPEAKER_30]: Some of the coldest mornings, they were out there greeting them with a smile.

269
01:03:23,507 --> 01:03:25,647
[SPEAKER_30]: I heard happy Monday, happy Tuesday.

270
01:03:27,108 --> 01:03:29,748
[SPEAKER_30]: The young children running up, giving hugs to the teachers.

271
01:03:30,429 --> 01:03:31,609
[SPEAKER_30]: You can't put a price on that.

272
01:03:31,909 --> 01:03:33,509
[SPEAKER_30]: As the commercial says, it's priceless.

273
01:03:34,169 --> 01:03:36,030
[SPEAKER_30]: But that's the type of staff that you have.

274
01:03:36,050 --> 01:03:40,311
[SPEAKER_30]: They're a caring, nourishing environment for the children.

275
01:03:42,005 --> 01:03:52,250
[SPEAKER_30]: The report, obviously you can't put every written word in the report, so it's better than a summary, but it's certainly not, you know, a big volume.

276
01:03:54,091 --> 01:03:59,813
[SPEAKER_30]: Mr. Belson was very open and honest in his interview, very open.

277
01:04:00,134 --> 01:04:01,574
[SPEAKER_30]: I mean, he suggested things.

278
01:04:02,715 --> 01:04:06,817
[SPEAKER_30]: Captain Kevin Fowler was the officer that was charged with the investigation.

279
01:04:07,637 --> 01:04:09,418
[SPEAKER_30]: He did a very thorough investigation.

280
01:04:10,116 --> 01:04:20,963
[SPEAKER_30]: I have to say that Mr. Belson was very open in his interview and maybe to his detriment, maybe that's why we're here this evening because he said things that maybe some people didn't want to hear.

281
01:04:21,784 --> 01:04:28,948
[SPEAKER_30]: I know in my conversation with Mr. Belson in the past, he wanted to make sure that we left no stone unturned.

282
01:04:29,709 --> 01:04:32,310
[SPEAKER_30]: He wasn't pointing the finger of blame at anyone.

283
01:04:32,911 --> 01:04:39,215
[SPEAKER_30]: He didn't want us to go with just the obvious, you know, what was obvious to us based on what was told to us at that point.

284
01:04:39,991 --> 01:04:43,553
[SPEAKER_30]: Yes, as the police department, we know how to conduct an investigation.

285
01:04:44,014 --> 01:04:50,298
[SPEAKER_30]: But I know that Mr. Belson cares very much about all of the schools, all of the teachers, and all of the students.

286
01:04:50,938 --> 01:04:53,160
[SPEAKER_30]: And I think that's why he left it open-ended.

287
01:04:53,680 --> 01:05:09,150
[SPEAKER_30]: He gave Captain Fowler somewhat of a climate of what was going on in the McGlynn School, just so that Captain Fowler had some kind of basis to say, OK, let's turn this other stone over and see where it leads us.

288
01:05:10,259 --> 01:05:17,604
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't think there was an intent on Mr. Belson's part, and he can speak better than I can about it, to blame any one individual.

289
01:05:18,084 --> 01:05:19,004
[SPEAKER_30]: He had questions.

290
01:05:19,785 --> 01:05:26,669
[SPEAKER_30]: Captain Fowler ended his interview with Mr. Belson by asking him, is there anything that you want to add?

291
01:05:27,189 --> 01:05:31,092
[SPEAKER_30]: Anything that maybe I didn't ask that you might want to

292
01:05:32,300 --> 01:05:43,003
[SPEAKER_30]: put out there, and he reiterated some of the things that he had mentioned earlier about some of the climate in the school itself, which is probably not unlike any other school in any other school district.

293
01:05:43,624 --> 01:05:54,707
[SPEAKER_30]: There's always something in play that causes someone who's not totally familiar with what goes on in that school to say, okay, let's go beyond just the obvious, what we have.

294
01:05:55,613 --> 01:05:57,575
[SPEAKER_30]: We asked all of these questions early on.

295
01:05:57,755 --> 01:05:58,556
[SPEAKER_30]: What was the motive?

296
01:05:58,676 --> 01:06:01,819
[SPEAKER_30]: Why would someone, number one, how did it get into the school?

297
01:06:02,819 --> 01:06:06,222
[SPEAKER_30]: Once it got into the school, how did it disappear from the principal's office?

298
01:06:07,083 --> 01:06:09,405
[SPEAKER_30]: Did it actually make it into the principal's office?

299
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:12,168
[SPEAKER_30]: A number of people are in there.

300
01:06:12,228 --> 01:06:22,837
[SPEAKER_30]: We heard from some of the people that we interviewed that school's pretty much an open building for a good number of hours after the school day is over with basketball teams, basketball leagues.

301
01:06:24,275 --> 01:06:26,235
[SPEAKER_30]: children coming and going, various doors.

302
01:06:27,416 --> 01:06:31,256
[SPEAKER_30]: Until this incident happened, we really didn't have to give much thought to it.

303
01:06:31,776 --> 01:06:37,297
[SPEAKER_30]: Now it caused everyone to focus and say, you know, we have to tighten up on the security of the building.

304
01:06:38,978 --> 01:06:42,178
[SPEAKER_30]: But that was only brought to light by the interviews that were conducted.

305
01:06:43,398 --> 01:06:46,159
[SPEAKER_30]: If you have specific questions for me, I'd be glad to answer.

306
01:06:46,219 --> 01:06:47,739
[SPEAKER_30]: I just want to clear the air.

307
01:06:48,379 --> 01:06:53,120
[SPEAKER_30]: Mr. Paulson did not want to, he said it numerous times, he didn't want to put anyone under the bus.

308
01:06:53,601 --> 01:06:56,882
[SPEAKER_30]: He accepted blame for not making the notification.

309
01:06:58,202 --> 01:07:07,205
[SPEAKER_30]: And I know in working with Roy in the past, he tries to minimize things, not to disrupt the school system, to keep the learning environment as normal as possible.

310
01:07:08,205 --> 01:07:13,307
[SPEAKER_30]: When we were forming the STARS program in Nemlech, that was Roy's main bone of contention.

311
01:07:13,807 --> 01:07:22,910
[SPEAKER_30]: How do you deal with a major incident, but still keep the learning environment as normal as possible, so that the students aren't disrupted and the teaching staff is not disrupted?

312
01:07:23,962 --> 01:07:30,305
[SPEAKER_30]: I think he realizes that, in this case, he made an error by not reporting it sooner.

313
01:07:30,825 --> 01:07:32,606
[SPEAKER_30]: If anything, he would have got it off his plate.

314
01:07:32,646 --> 01:07:35,948
[SPEAKER_30]: It would have been on my plate a lot earlier, and then the burden would be on me.

315
01:07:36,348 --> 01:07:37,369
[SPEAKER_30]: What do I do about it?

316
01:07:38,309 --> 01:07:43,471
[SPEAKER_30]: And quite honestly, in this interview, that's the avenue that he was coming from.

317
01:07:44,812 --> 01:07:45,552
[SPEAKER_30]: It was his fault.

318
01:07:45,793 --> 01:07:46,553
[SPEAKER_30]: He took the blame.

319
01:07:47,368 --> 01:07:49,869
[SPEAKER_30]: Are we ever gonna find out how that clip got into the school?

320
01:07:50,050 --> 01:07:53,912
[SPEAKER_30]: It doesn't appear unless someone out there who has knowledge and wants to come forward now.

321
01:07:55,433 --> 01:07:56,893
[SPEAKER_30]: That's the only way we're gonna find out.

322
01:07:57,854 --> 01:08:02,577
[SPEAKER_30]: Were there discrepancies by some of the other individuals that may have been interviewed?

323
01:08:02,697 --> 01:08:11,542
[SPEAKER_30]: There were some discrepancies in the story in at least one individual's story of what they said about what they knew and what took place.

324
01:08:12,022 --> 01:08:13,523
[SPEAKER_30]: But other than that,

325
01:08:14,216 --> 01:08:28,249
[SPEAKER_30]: I have to say that Mr. Belson was just at the police station giving Captain Fowler a clear overview of what's going on, what the dynamics are in the city, and what the dynamics are at the McGlynn School as a whole.

326
01:08:29,490 --> 01:08:32,953
[SPEAKER_30]: But at no time did he blame any individual group.

327
01:08:33,374 --> 01:08:36,737
[SPEAKER_30]: I know there's quotes in there, and I know that maybe some things

328
01:08:38,648 --> 01:08:45,951
[SPEAKER_30]: When you put a quote in and you don't put the full paragraph in that probably goes along with that quote, things can be taken out of context.

329
01:08:45,991 --> 01:08:52,534
[SPEAKER_30]: And I apologize for that if I caused disruption in the school system for that reason.

330
01:08:53,534 --> 01:09:01,217
[SPEAKER_30]: But I know that the avenue that Mr. Belson was coming from was that, please, don't just go with the obvious.

331
01:09:01,738 --> 01:09:04,339
[SPEAKER_30]: Turn all the stones over and see where that leads.

332
01:09:04,379 --> 01:09:05,299
[SPEAKER_30]: And that's what was done.

333
01:09:05,319 --> 01:09:06,740
[SPEAKER_30]: That's why there was such a delay.

334
01:09:08,023 --> 01:09:09,564
[SPEAKER_30]: in the investigative report.

335
01:09:09,864 --> 01:09:13,065
[SPEAKER_30]: And unfortunately, we're all upset that we couldn't get a conclusion.

336
01:09:13,085 --> 01:09:30,271
[SPEAKER_30]: There's nothing more frustrating to expend numerous hours and not come up with an answer as to how did the clip get there, who did it belong to, how did it disappear from the office, and just trying to find the whodunit patch.

337
01:09:31,832 --> 01:09:33,112
[SPEAKER_30]: And that's what's frustrating.

338
01:09:33,172 --> 01:09:34,733
[SPEAKER_30]: But the report speaks for itself.

339
01:09:36,512 --> 01:09:50,837
[SPEAKER_30]: I'm glad to answer any questions that anyone may have, but I know that Mr. Bellson was not looking to, certainly not looking to cause this problem here this evening, and nor was I. Thank you, Chief.

340
01:09:51,118 --> 01:09:53,859
[SPEAKER_29]: I'd like to continue for a minute.

341
01:09:53,879 --> 01:10:03,822
[SPEAKER_29]: As the Chief pointed out, I didn't name a single individual at that school or anywhere else that I thought was responsible for anything.

342
01:10:03,842 --> 01:10:05,723
[SPEAKER_29]: I took the blame myself.

343
01:10:06,677 --> 01:10:14,864
[SPEAKER_29]: even though I never saw the clip, I had no chain of custody of the clip, and I had conflicting opinions coming at me from all angles.

344
01:10:15,824 --> 01:10:16,645
[SPEAKER_29]: But I took the blame.

345
01:10:17,866 --> 01:10:28,134
[SPEAKER_29]: Now, if anyone feels offended or upset, or feels that I did finger them inappropriately, then you have my apology, because that is not my intent.

346
01:10:29,075 --> 01:10:35,020
[SPEAKER_29]: My intent was to aid the police department in their investigation, as the chief said, to leave no stone unturned.

347
01:10:36,247 --> 01:10:47,177
[SPEAKER_29]: to let them know everything that was going on in that school, everything that was happening, because who can possibly know all the things that might have been possible at that point in time?

348
01:10:48,478 --> 01:10:50,900
[SPEAKER_29]: My goal was to aid the police department.

349
01:10:52,922 --> 01:11:00,289
[SPEAKER_29]: You know, it's tough enough some days for all of us in our very respective jobs, but I didn't go there with a lawyer.

350
01:11:01,323 --> 01:11:03,103
[SPEAKER_29]: I didn't ask for any representation.

351
01:11:03,263 --> 01:11:08,885
[SPEAKER_29]: I just simply answered the questions and provided the information that was asked of me.

352
01:11:09,985 --> 01:11:16,026
[SPEAKER_29]: And once again, if there are members of the faculty who feel that I offended them, I apologize.

353
01:11:17,026 --> 01:11:20,087
[SPEAKER_29]: I have no doubt that each of you is a dedicated professional.

354
01:11:20,927 --> 01:11:24,628
[SPEAKER_29]: I have no doubt that each of you wants to do a great job for our young people.

355
01:11:25,528 --> 01:11:30,369
[SPEAKER_29]: And in fact, as I look out, as I've been around a little while, I've probably hired most of you.

356
01:11:31,529 --> 01:11:34,410
[SPEAKER_29]: probably was the person who signed your employment letter.

357
01:11:36,251 --> 01:11:41,734
[SPEAKER_29]: Clearly, I believe that the McGlynn can be a good school and is a good school.

358
01:11:42,494 --> 01:11:43,855
[SPEAKER_29]: We've had some differences this year.

359
01:11:44,275 --> 01:11:44,955
[SPEAKER_29]: That's factual.

360
01:11:46,356 --> 01:11:48,237
[SPEAKER_29]: This isn't brand new this month.

361
01:11:49,758 --> 01:12:00,543
[SPEAKER_29]: But I believe going forward that good things can happen and that if we all put our mind to it, we're gonna make a difference and it's gonna work out just fine.

362
01:12:02,507 --> 01:12:03,788
[SPEAKER_29]: So I appreciate you listening.

363
01:12:04,708 --> 01:12:06,550
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm happy to answer any questions anyone has.

364
01:12:06,570 --> 01:12:09,892
[SPEAKER_29]: Mike, do you want to say something at this point?

365
01:12:11,112 --> 01:12:11,332
[SPEAKER_29]: Okay.

366
01:12:11,633 --> 01:12:13,134
[SPEAKER_29]: I have a person with me.

367
01:12:15,695 --> 01:12:17,096
[SPEAKER_24]: Please step forward, please.

368
01:12:23,300 --> 01:12:24,180
[SPEAKER_24]: Your name and address, please.

369
01:12:24,441 --> 01:12:24,681
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

370
01:12:25,461 --> 01:12:27,082
[SPEAKER_20]: My name is Marilyn Blumzak.

371
01:12:27,943 --> 01:12:30,764
[SPEAKER_20]: I am a former resident of Medford for 52 years.

372
01:12:32,235 --> 01:12:37,738
[SPEAKER_20]: My husband was the city solicitor for the city of Medford for 33 years.

373
01:12:38,438 --> 01:12:49,564
[SPEAKER_20]: I am proud to say that I was a Medford teacher and still am a paying member of NEA and the Massachusetts Teachers Association.

374
01:12:50,484 --> 01:12:56,668
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a distinct pleasure for me to be a teacher, particularly in this city that I love.

375
01:12:57,948 --> 01:12:59,609
[SPEAKER_20]: I've resided here for 52 years.

376
01:13:02,197 --> 01:13:14,767
[SPEAKER_20]: when I, my youngest of four was in junior high school, had the privilege of being president of the Lawrence Memorial Hospital Auxiliary.

377
01:13:15,187 --> 01:13:30,979
[SPEAKER_20]: And at that point, I was doing a health career fair for the Lawrence Memorial Hospital when Mr. Bellison suggested that I come and help him write a grant

378
01:13:31,395 --> 01:13:40,779
[SPEAKER_20]: called CETA, the Comprehensive Educational Training Act, and the city of Medford received monies for that grant.

379
01:13:41,699 --> 01:13:47,282
[SPEAKER_20]: I wanted to tell you today, to remind you, that we live in very troubled times.

380
01:13:49,543 --> 01:13:53,184
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't envy any one of you elected officials.

381
01:13:53,584 --> 01:13:56,105
[SPEAKER_20]: You're doing the best job that you possibly can.

382
01:13:56,205 --> 01:14:00,027
[SPEAKER_20]: Stephanie, all of the members of the school committee, the city council,

383
01:14:01,467 --> 01:14:07,291
[SPEAKER_20]: The mayor certainly has a big responsibility, but so does Mr. Bellson.

384
01:14:08,272 --> 01:14:09,893
[SPEAKER_20]: You trust him as voters.

385
01:14:10,833 --> 01:14:15,056
[SPEAKER_20]: I trust him as a friend, as a teacher.

386
01:14:15,196 --> 01:14:19,880
[SPEAKER_20]: He was a civics teacher many, many years ago before he became a teacher.

387
01:14:20,460 --> 01:14:27,425
[SPEAKER_20]: He's always had the interest of his teachers and the children in this city at heart.

388
01:14:28,225 --> 01:14:30,727
[SPEAKER_20]: He is a sincere, dedicated,

389
01:14:31,267 --> 01:14:32,688
[SPEAKER_20]: trustworthy gentleman.

390
01:14:33,509 --> 01:14:38,692
[SPEAKER_20]: He has served the city of Medford diligently for many, many, many years.

391
01:14:39,793 --> 01:14:40,974
[SPEAKER_20]: He's apologized.

392
01:14:41,654 --> 01:14:45,817
[SPEAKER_20]: He might have done wrong, but again, we're in troubled times.

393
01:14:46,958 --> 01:14:58,907
[SPEAKER_20]: We have to trust the chief, Buddy Sacco, all of the people that we elect, and hopefully all of you in your hearts can see that this man deserves your praise.

394
01:14:59,975 --> 01:15:01,596
[SPEAKER_20]: and all of you deserve your praise.

395
01:15:02,037 --> 01:15:09,482
[SPEAKER_20]: I salute all of you and say to all of the people behind me that if you want to make a difference, go out and vote.

396
01:15:19,509 --> 01:15:19,790
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

397
01:15:20,617 --> 01:15:23,658
[SPEAKER_14]: I just wanted to address the McGlynn teachers.

398
01:15:24,679 --> 01:15:42,047
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciate their coming down tonight and telling the school committee what individually they've been up to in their classrooms and outreaching with students and to really take a hold this year and in previous years as well, but really to work and

399
01:15:43,950 --> 01:15:46,791
[SPEAKER_14]: maximize the potential for every student at the McGlynn.

400
01:15:47,571 --> 01:15:54,254
[SPEAKER_14]: It's unfortunate that it's under these circumstances, perhaps, but it's always great to hear from our faculty members.

401
01:15:55,795 --> 01:15:58,656
[SPEAKER_14]: I do not make the leap that I think some have.

402
01:15:59,376 --> 01:16:00,537
[SPEAKER_14]: There was a lot of tension.

403
01:16:00,637 --> 01:16:01,337
[SPEAKER_14]: We know that.

404
01:16:01,457 --> 01:16:06,579
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's a fact that there was tension at the school this year, earlier, and in fact many of the

405
01:16:07,337 --> 01:16:27,958
[SPEAKER_14]: McGlynn teachers came and addressed the school committee, but in no way, shape, or form does that mean or should it imply that we don't have the greatest respect for our McGlynn teachers, that we don't value their input each and every day, and that we aren't extremely proud to know that these are

406
01:16:28,568 --> 01:16:31,109
[SPEAKER_14]: our staff, our people who are working at the school.

407
01:16:31,790 --> 01:16:33,190
[SPEAKER_14]: I only see bright things.

408
01:16:33,410 --> 01:16:38,913
[SPEAKER_14]: I know, you know, there's some turbulent times, but out of turbulent times, we will get better.

409
01:16:39,733 --> 01:16:44,455
[SPEAKER_14]: And so I thank you very much for coming and appreciate the statements of those who came.

410
01:16:45,856 --> 01:16:46,196
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

411
01:16:47,137 --> 01:16:47,817
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Ruggiero.

412
01:16:50,238 --> 01:16:51,839
[SPEAKER_10]: Chief Sacco, can I ask you a question, please?

413
01:16:58,512 --> 01:17:02,735
[SPEAKER_10]: So, reading through the report, I can understand some of the teachers' frustrations.

414
01:17:02,875 --> 01:17:06,017
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to make sure, this is absolutely clear.

415
01:17:06,758 --> 01:17:17,746
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you or any of your officers believe that Superintendent Nelson floated a conspiracy theory that perhaps there was some sort of setup?

416
01:17:18,426 --> 01:17:20,528
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to make sure absolutely clear.

417
01:17:20,848 --> 01:17:23,730
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the answer is obvious, but I want to make sure from your mouth.

418
01:17:24,263 --> 01:17:32,689
[SPEAKER_10]: So none of your officers feel like there was any sort of a sense of Roy Belson trying to say there was some cabal to take down the principal, is that correct?

419
01:17:34,230 --> 01:17:39,494
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't believe it, nor do the officers that were involved in the investigation believe that.

420
01:17:39,734 --> 01:17:47,620
[SPEAKER_30]: It was just something that was put out there as a reminder, as I said earlier, don't just go with the obvious, look at everything.

421
01:17:49,662 --> 01:17:50,162
[SPEAKER_30]: That was not

422
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:53,741
[SPEAKER_30]: Obviously, if it was something, many more people would have been interviewed.

423
01:17:53,801 --> 01:17:58,082
[SPEAKER_30]: We would have conducted the investigation in a different manner.

424
01:17:58,522 --> 01:18:06,544
[SPEAKER_30]: So I think that tells you as of early March when we interviewed Mr. Belson, nothing further came from that.

425
01:18:06,604 --> 01:18:14,646
[SPEAKER_30]: We didn't go to any other teacher, administrator, or anyone else that wasn't already on our list to interview based on what we had at that point.

426
01:18:15,286 --> 01:18:20,127
[SPEAKER_30]: So as far as any kind of conspiracy theory, we never operated under that.

427
01:18:21,700 --> 01:18:29,746
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to make, from my opinion, from talking, I've talked, had the opportunity, the blessing of talking to a number of the teachers, and I've also talked to a number of the parents.

428
01:18:30,847 --> 01:18:35,550
[SPEAKER_10]: I've heard so many wonderful things about how hardworking

429
01:18:36,817 --> 01:18:42,841
[SPEAKER_10]: almost, I can't even think of an exception, all of the McGlynn teachers I've talked with.

430
01:18:43,282 --> 01:18:48,906
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just want to express my sincere gratitude for all the hard work you do.

431
01:18:49,606 --> 01:18:52,908
[SPEAKER_10]: As a former teacher myself, I was never a successful middle school teacher.

432
01:18:54,510 --> 01:18:57,652
[SPEAKER_10]: I find middle school teaching the most difficult of all teaching.

433
01:18:58,753 --> 01:19:04,717
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I have a deep, deep appreciation for all the hard work you do, and I thank you very much.

434
01:19:05,817 --> 01:19:13,220
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope that it's pretty clear that this is maybe a misreading or a misunderstanding of what the report was made.

435
01:19:13,320 --> 01:19:22,724
[SPEAKER_10]: I do not believe that Roy Bellson ever tried to throw the teachers under the bus as if any of you would ever lay bullets in an auditorium in a safe space.

436
01:19:23,784 --> 01:19:25,425
[SPEAKER_10]: I just can't imagine any of you doing that.

437
01:19:25,445 --> 01:19:28,106
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you, and I'm sorry about this miscommunication.

438
01:19:29,078 --> 01:19:29,839
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. Benedetto.

439
01:19:30,419 --> 01:19:31,160
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you very much.

440
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:57,639
[SPEAKER_22]: I recently found out that I had read the report and the first time I read it, it didn't jump out at me that the teachers would take it this way because Roy has given, Mr. Bellson has given us different scenarios of what could have happened to have that gun clip be left in there, whether,

441
01:19:59,118 --> 01:20:00,799
[SPEAKER_22]: It was this scenario or many others.

442
01:20:00,879 --> 01:20:04,922
[SPEAKER_22]: He's given a few ideas for people to look at.

443
01:20:05,162 --> 01:20:06,303
[SPEAKER_22]: So it didn't jump out at me.

444
01:20:06,863 --> 01:20:13,648
[SPEAKER_22]: But when it came to my attention and I reread this section, I could see how you would feel and take this in this manner.

445
01:20:14,909 --> 01:20:18,811
[SPEAKER_22]: And for that, as a school committee, I'm sorry that you felt that way.

446
01:20:19,352 --> 01:20:25,716
[SPEAKER_22]: Because I value the work that you do with the students in our community more than I could ever say in words.

447
01:20:26,623 --> 01:20:36,225
[SPEAKER_22]: I value the extra time, the extra mittens when they're cold, the hugs when their parents leave them at the door and they miss their mommy.

448
01:20:36,745 --> 01:20:41,126
[SPEAKER_22]: And I don't care if they're kindergarten or eighth grade, there are days when you miss your mom.

449
01:20:42,366 --> 01:20:47,627
[SPEAKER_22]: So you take care of the students both academically and emotionally.

450
01:20:48,307 --> 01:20:51,047
[SPEAKER_22]: And if your emotions were hurt by this, I feel bad.

451
01:20:51,607 --> 01:20:54,488
[SPEAKER_22]: And as a community member, I want you to know

452
01:20:55,454 --> 01:21:01,055
[SPEAKER_22]: I, as a member of this committee, value your work every single day, every single night.

453
01:21:01,895 --> 01:21:16,598
[SPEAKER_22]: And recently, I was just at your school on Saturday night, and I saw your new assistant principal there, working hard and late and missing an evening out with her family and her friends to make sure your school was safe.

454
01:21:16,718 --> 01:21:16,918
[SPEAKER_22]: Ms.

455
01:21:17,019 --> 01:21:23,960
[SPEAKER_22]: Lu, I don't know if you're here, but I want you to know I appreciate you holding down the foot in this very difficult year.

456
01:21:24,844 --> 01:21:26,125
[SPEAKER_22]: You've done amazing work.

457
01:21:35,529 --> 01:21:43,113
[SPEAKER_22]: And I was at the play the other night, and the kids had the biggest smile, and they performed, and it was so uplifting.

458
01:21:43,173 --> 01:21:52,017
[SPEAKER_22]: And it was after a day I moved my oldest child out of my house, so I was so happy to see kids and see them singing and dancing.

459
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:55,582
[SPEAKER_22]: even though I was missing my own children being that age again.

460
01:21:55,962 --> 01:22:00,885
[SPEAKER_22]: So it was joyful and happy, and I was glad to see that happening at the McGlynn.

461
01:22:01,325 --> 01:22:10,870
[SPEAKER_22]: So again, I want to thank you all and renew my commitment to you as a committee member, that I am here any time that you feel that you have something to say.

462
01:22:17,236 --> 01:22:23,304
[SPEAKER_24]: If I could just make a comment from the chair, I've had the privilege of getting to know quite a few of you over the past few months.

463
01:22:24,219 --> 01:22:25,640
[SPEAKER_24]: And the job you do is amazing.

464
01:22:26,021 --> 01:22:28,623
[SPEAKER_24]: How much you care about your school is outstanding.

465
01:22:29,283 --> 01:22:31,665
[SPEAKER_24]: And we're just really, really proud to have you there.

466
01:22:32,126 --> 01:22:39,292
[SPEAKER_24]: I hope that parents, fifth grade parents out there, see these wonderful people and change their mind about where they want to send their child.

467
01:22:39,612 --> 01:22:43,956
[SPEAKER_24]: And no disrespect, Mr. DeLiva, but you guys are amazing.

468
01:22:44,376 --> 01:22:45,897
[SPEAKER_24]: You do work every single day.

469
01:22:45,917 --> 01:22:47,018
[SPEAKER_24]: A lot of it goes unnoticed.

470
01:22:47,038 --> 01:22:51,122
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Kremen will be laying all the flags for Memorial Day in just a few short weeks.

471
01:22:51,802 --> 01:22:54,943
[SPEAKER_24]: all on his own because he thinks it's important, and it is important.

472
01:22:55,363 --> 01:23:02,025
[SPEAKER_24]: So there are things that you do on a daily basis that go unnoticed, but you touch so many hearts along the way.

473
01:23:02,145 --> 01:23:08,086
[SPEAKER_24]: So just know that we respect your work, all of the administrators as well, of the work that you do on a daily basis.

474
01:23:08,226 --> 01:23:11,367
[SPEAKER_24]: It's not just education anymore.

475
01:23:11,387 --> 01:23:13,808
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, it's way different than how when we were little.

476
01:23:14,268 --> 01:23:18,869
[SPEAKER_24]: So things have drastically changed, and your patience level and your commitment is outstanding.

477
01:23:20,117 --> 01:23:21,978
[SPEAKER_24]: We support you and we applaud your work.

478
01:23:22,298 --> 01:23:22,679
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

479
01:23:27,442 --> 01:23:36,547
[SPEAKER_26]: So first, I want to say thank you, Mr. Belson, for doing the right thing and for apologizing for these comments that did offend many people.

480
01:23:36,947 --> 01:23:41,450
[SPEAKER_26]: And thank you for the school committee for your support and continued support this year.

481
01:23:41,850 --> 01:23:49,215
[SPEAKER_26]: And we look forward to working with you and making sure that the McGlynn is seen as a truly great school that it is.

482
01:23:49,645 --> 01:23:50,526
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you all very much.

483
01:23:50,546 --> 01:23:50,586
[SPEAKER_26]: Hi.

484
01:23:59,732 --> 01:24:00,773
[SPEAKER_15]: May I have the address, please?

485
01:24:00,813 --> 01:24:03,215
[SPEAKER_15]: Ann Marie Cugno, 871 Felsway, Medford, Mass, 02155.

486
01:24:04,596 --> 01:24:10,820
[SPEAKER_15]: I just want to say, as a former school committee member, I didn't have the opportunity last time the McGlynn parents came up.

487
01:24:11,301 --> 01:24:15,223
[SPEAKER_15]: But it is, I'm sorry, McGlynn teachers and administration came up.

488
01:24:15,263 --> 01:24:18,806
[SPEAKER_15]: But as a parent of the McGlynn, I want to say that

489
01:24:19,307 --> 01:24:46,058
[SPEAKER_15]: your strides in your everyday, I'm sorry, it's addressing them, but what you do on an everyday basis is really immeasurable, and if you don't believe us as parents, just think when the older kids that are in high school and in college, when they're all coming back into your building and they're looking for you, that's gratification, and that shows that you're all doing the right thing.

490
01:24:46,538 --> 01:24:51,683
[SPEAKER_15]: So unfortunately there's high emotions going on, but we are very proud of both of our middle schools.

491
01:24:51,743 --> 01:24:54,625
[SPEAKER_15]: And as parents, I can say I've had them at both schools.

492
01:24:55,246 --> 01:24:57,107
[SPEAKER_15]: And you need to find your fit.

493
01:24:57,347 --> 01:25:00,370
[SPEAKER_15]: It doesn't matter how many children you have, you need to find your fit.

494
01:25:00,470 --> 01:25:01,991
[SPEAKER_15]: So I just want to say thank you to all of you.

495
01:25:02,051 --> 01:25:02,392
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

496
01:25:07,236 --> 01:25:11,119
[SPEAKER_24]: All right, thank you very much for coming tonight.

497
01:25:11,359 --> 01:25:11,660
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

498
01:25:14,957 --> 01:25:17,321
[SPEAKER_24]: Also, while we're under suspension, we have Ms.

499
01:25:17,381 --> 01:25:28,800
[SPEAKER_24]: Melanie McLaughlin and Angela Munsell-Moore regarding family and community engagement, a status update on the investigation, and the successful plan for superintendent and deputy superintendent.

500
01:25:38,323 --> 01:25:41,728
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello school committee members, Madam Mayor, community.

501
01:25:42,129 --> 01:25:46,375
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Melanie Perkins McLaughlin and I live on Alston Street in Medford.

502
01:25:46,395 --> 01:25:52,303
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi all, I'm Angela Moore and I'm on Vine Street in Medford.

503
01:25:54,063 --> 01:26:00,545
[SPEAKER_03]: So we wanted to come before you folks and before the community to ask some questions that we had and concerns that we had.

504
01:26:01,106 --> 01:26:06,407
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that you know Angela and I as regular attendees of the school committee meetings.

505
01:26:06,427 --> 01:26:07,848
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been coming for several years.

506
01:26:08,848 --> 01:26:10,969
[SPEAKER_03]: Also have children in the school district.

507
01:26:11,029 --> 01:26:14,170
[SPEAKER_03]: I have two high schoolers and a elementary schooler.

508
01:26:14,190 --> 01:26:22,153
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm also the co-chair of the Medford Special Education Parent Advisory Council, representing approximately 800 families in the district.

509
01:26:23,484 --> 01:26:36,127
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the things we wanted to talk about was it was really, really interesting to watch tonight's events because so much of what I feel like we all watch tonight is family and community engagement.

510
01:26:37,087 --> 01:26:41,688
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's an important part of what we really need to have as Medford moves forward.

511
01:26:41,788 --> 01:26:50,430
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope that Dr. Edouard-Vincent watches these archival meetings to understand what it is we are looking for and what we need.

512
01:26:50,550 --> 01:26:59,892
[SPEAKER_03]: And everyone knows that we had a very unfortunate event and we had an unfortunate meeting that occurred in February where there was a lot of heated emotions and where there was a lot of

513
01:27:02,444 --> 01:27:05,866
[SPEAKER_03]: And people talked about that for a long time in the community afterwards.

514
01:27:05,906 --> 01:27:10,330
[SPEAKER_03]: And they talked about how terrible that meeting was in so many different ways.

515
01:27:10,550 --> 01:27:16,155
[SPEAKER_03]: And what wasn't talked about, unfortunately, in my opinion, was what brought that about.

516
01:27:16,675 --> 01:27:24,001
[SPEAKER_03]: Not so much the incident itself, but the lack of family and community engagement in our community.

517
01:27:24,882 --> 01:27:31,307
[SPEAKER_03]: Even this context where you have to be willing to stand up at a podium and speak into a microphone.

518
01:27:32,627 --> 01:27:38,248
[SPEAKER_03]: with your back turned to the rest of the community to be able to converse and express what your feelings are.

519
01:27:38,729 --> 01:27:42,929
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I went on to the website earlier today to just sort of look at what the protocol is.

520
01:27:43,009 --> 01:27:46,030
[SPEAKER_03]: And I understand protocol and the need for protocol.

521
01:27:46,150 --> 01:27:49,771
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to get the business part of it going and the meeting moving along.

522
01:27:50,751 --> 01:27:54,352
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, but the website is you have to submit in writing your request.

523
01:27:54,372 --> 01:27:55,692
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to do it a week ahead of time.

524
01:27:55,712 --> 01:27:57,053
[SPEAKER_03]: You have exactly three minutes.

525
01:27:57,093 --> 01:27:59,053
[SPEAKER_03]: You can come up to the podium and you can talk to us.

526
01:28:00,323 --> 01:28:02,584
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not family and community engagement.

527
01:28:03,464 --> 01:28:07,226
[SPEAKER_03]: I had the benefit last year of going to graduate school, and I really enjoyed my time there.

528
01:28:07,246 --> 01:28:16,450
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a great teacher who helped write for the Department of Education at the federal level the family and community engagement guidelines and some material there.

529
01:28:16,550 --> 01:28:20,112
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the things they talk about is family and community.

530
01:28:20,152 --> 01:28:21,492
[SPEAKER_03]: We're all part of the community.

531
01:28:21,512 --> 01:28:23,373
[SPEAKER_03]: So the teachers that came up tonight are the community.

532
01:28:23,413 --> 01:28:25,554
[SPEAKER_03]: The school committee members are the community.

533
01:28:26,034 --> 01:28:27,275
[SPEAKER_03]: Our shop owners are the community.

534
01:28:27,315 --> 01:28:28,375
[SPEAKER_03]: The parents are the community.

535
01:28:28,715 --> 01:28:29,996
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not just families.

536
01:28:30,496 --> 01:28:35,205
[SPEAKER_03]: or teachers or people that don't have children.

537
01:28:35,485 --> 01:28:36,908
[SPEAKER_03]: We're all a community together.

538
01:28:36,928 --> 01:28:40,274
[SPEAKER_03]: I had this really great experience last week where

539
01:28:41,386 --> 01:28:48,332
[SPEAKER_03]: I set up an appointment to talk with our new EL director, Paul Texera, and we had the best conversation.

540
01:28:48,652 --> 01:28:59,440
[SPEAKER_03]: We sat in his office for just about an hour, and I learned a little bit about him, he learned a little bit about me, and we both walked away from that experience wanting to work together and really wanting to collaborate with each other.

541
01:29:00,001 --> 01:29:05,385
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thought, you know, what would have happened if we hadn't built those relationships with each other, if we didn't know each other?

542
01:29:05,885 --> 01:29:07,587
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what family and community engagement is.

543
01:29:07,647 --> 01:29:10,389
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about building relationships and about knowing each other.

544
01:29:11,070 --> 01:29:21,960
[SPEAKER_03]: Folks might recall when this all happened a few months ago, there was a post on social media where one of Mr. Belson's family members talked about who Mr. Belson is as a man.

545
01:29:23,155 --> 01:29:26,537
[SPEAKER_03]: And we heard from his friend earlier talking about who Mr. Belson is as a man.

546
01:29:27,138 --> 01:29:32,642
[SPEAKER_03]: And personalizing Mr. Belson and personalizing each one of us is what builds community and relationship.

547
01:29:32,962 --> 01:29:38,726
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think people are able to relate much better to who he was as a man because we learned about who you are as a man.

548
01:29:39,246 --> 01:29:42,228
[SPEAKER_03]: Tonight, seeing you apologize, we learned about who you are as a man.

549
01:29:42,789 --> 01:29:45,230
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the important piece of family and community engagement.

550
01:29:45,330 --> 01:29:47,071
[SPEAKER_03]: It's collaboration and communication.

551
01:29:47,432 --> 01:29:48,572
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not doing it enough.

552
01:29:48,973 --> 01:29:50,274
[SPEAKER_03]: And we can't say enough about that.

553
01:29:50,314 --> 01:29:51,715
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why I stand before you tonight

554
01:29:52,666 --> 01:29:55,828
[SPEAKER_03]: for more family and community collaboration.

555
01:29:56,248 --> 01:29:57,289
[SPEAKER_03]: Bring people to the table.

556
01:29:57,329 --> 01:29:58,390
[SPEAKER_03]: I was watching Justin tonight.

557
01:29:58,410 --> 01:29:59,891
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so glad Justin's here.

558
01:30:00,671 --> 01:30:01,972
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a relatively new thing.

559
01:30:02,132 --> 01:30:03,193
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a great thing.

560
01:30:04,373 --> 01:30:08,876
[SPEAKER_03]: More roundtable discussion, not having to come up to the podium and ask and talk.

561
01:30:08,956 --> 01:30:10,677
[SPEAKER_03]: Or you guys were inundated with emails.

562
01:30:10,717 --> 01:30:12,298
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad you were inundated with emails.

563
01:30:12,358 --> 01:30:14,460
[SPEAKER_03]: I say to anybody watching tonight, keep them coming.

564
01:30:14,840 --> 01:30:20,523
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep communicating, please, because we need you to communicate to make a difference and to make things transparent.

565
01:30:21,624 --> 01:30:31,970
[SPEAKER_03]: So getting to the transparent piece, even in the past few months with everything that's been going on, there's still been sort of concerns around some of the transparency.

566
01:30:32,170 --> 01:30:38,173
[SPEAKER_03]: And what you saw the night in February and what I witnessed, which was, frankly, traumatizing for me.

567
01:30:38,213 --> 01:30:44,497
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know about other people, but I was sort of shell-shocked when I left there at the anger and the vitriol that was there that night.

568
01:30:44,917 --> 01:30:47,939
[SPEAKER_03]: But I was also really very clear what the message was.

569
01:30:48,099 --> 01:30:50,120
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was, we don't feel like we're being heard.

570
01:30:50,561 --> 01:30:59,984
[SPEAKER_03]: And in any relationship, as people can attest in their marriage or their relationship with their children or what have you, when you feel like you're not being heard, what typically happens?

571
01:31:00,604 --> 01:31:01,144
[SPEAKER_03]: You yell.

572
01:31:01,344 --> 01:31:02,025
[SPEAKER_03]: You're angry.

573
01:31:02,825 --> 01:31:04,125
[SPEAKER_03]: You get out of control.

574
01:31:05,326 --> 01:31:07,166
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you're being heard, you're collaborating.

575
01:31:07,186 --> 01:31:08,006
[SPEAKER_03]: You're working together.

576
01:31:08,166 --> 01:31:09,167
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what we need to do.

577
01:31:09,687 --> 01:31:19,670
[SPEAKER_03]: So in the most recent Committee of the Whole meeting, when we found out by social media that the decision to extend the superintendent's contract went from

578
01:31:20,425 --> 01:31:24,988
[SPEAKER_03]: April to June, that was not family and community engagement.

579
01:31:25,428 --> 01:31:29,150
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a really bad example of the lack of family and community engagement.

580
01:31:29,911 --> 01:31:33,413
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, none of this is personal for me around Mr. Bellson.

581
01:31:33,493 --> 01:31:38,516
[SPEAKER_03]: We've had everybody knows we've had our differences, Mr. Bellson, but we've always been very professional and respectful with each other.

582
01:31:38,536 --> 01:31:40,977
[SPEAKER_03]: It's never been personal and it never will be.

583
01:31:42,158 --> 01:31:47,982
[SPEAKER_03]: But in terms of having community transparency to find out on social media that this decision was reversed was so unfortunate.

584
01:31:48,002 --> 01:31:50,063
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like, oh, it felt like we were moving forward

585
01:31:50,503 --> 01:31:59,065
[SPEAKER_03]: and we were gaining some momentum and some trust, and then this happened, and you could see it in the response on social media, the way so many community members felt about that.

586
01:32:00,086 --> 01:32:14,310
[SPEAKER_03]: But if they had just been consulted with ahead of time, if people had just had an idea, even the notice was, you know, that there's a committee of the whole meeting and that there was going to be some discussion, which frankly was at the same time as the National Honor Society meeting, which is what I was attending,

587
01:32:16,154 --> 01:32:20,776
[SPEAKER_03]: that there was going to be some discussion that this might even be the case, you would have had a much larger turnout, I have no doubt.

588
01:32:21,217 --> 01:32:25,859
[SPEAKER_03]: And people would have felt like they were invested in that decision and had some momentum and part of that decision.

589
01:32:25,959 --> 01:32:40,486
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess what I want to ask as we're talking about transparency and moving forward and, you know, hoping that you folks will hear us, and I know that we've done presentations in the past as a CPAC talking about family and community engagement and the need for it.

590
01:32:41,145 --> 01:32:46,606
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that this is really a fascinating study, frankly, in family and community engagement this past year that we've had here.

591
01:32:47,506 --> 01:32:50,787
[SPEAKER_03]: But I guess the questions I have is, I have a few questions.

592
01:32:50,967 --> 01:33:00,389
[SPEAKER_03]: One is how, also I want to mention that we also had a public records request in a few months ago that has not been responded to.

593
01:33:00,449 --> 01:33:08,310
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we try to submit the public records request through the website, we get a mail or DM back that says the public records request is not accessible.

594
01:33:09,148 --> 01:33:12,510
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, I just kind of feel like it's a metaphor for the scenario.

595
01:33:12,891 --> 01:33:19,555
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I'd love for folks to look into that as well, because if a community member has a public records request, it shouldn't be a mail-or-demon back.

596
01:33:19,715 --> 01:33:26,960
[SPEAKER_03]: And once we've notified the community, the school, that it is a mail-or-demon, hopefully it's fixed and people respond to that constituent.

597
01:33:28,561 --> 01:33:29,482
[SPEAKER_03]: So questions we have.

598
01:33:29,522 --> 01:33:34,105
[SPEAKER_03]: How is the community made aware that the vote would be to continue the superintendent contract from

599
01:33:35,186 --> 01:33:40,150
[SPEAKER_03]: April 30th to June 30th, effectively reversing the February decision.

600
01:33:40,190 --> 01:33:43,212
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm wondering how the community was made aware that that was going to be the vote.

601
01:33:44,013 --> 01:33:44,954
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the first question.

602
01:33:44,974 --> 01:33:50,218
[SPEAKER_03]: The second is, did any school committee members let their community or constituents know

603
01:33:50,752 --> 01:33:52,213
[SPEAKER_03]: this would be a consideration.

604
01:33:52,813 --> 01:33:54,113
[SPEAKER_03]: If so, how was that done?

605
01:33:54,153 --> 01:33:55,814
[SPEAKER_03]: And if not, I'm wondering why.

606
01:33:55,834 --> 01:34:06,838
[SPEAKER_03]: And then also we're wondering about the survey results for the superintendent and how or whether they were shared from the community survey that was done, asking folks what they would like.

607
01:34:08,099 --> 01:34:08,399
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

608
01:34:10,099 --> 01:34:10,700
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Russo.

609
01:34:11,580 --> 01:34:15,381
[SPEAKER_11]: I can speak quickly to the survey results, like five times now I've written down.

610
01:34:15,401 --> 01:34:16,882
[SPEAKER_11]: Get those results out to the public.

611
01:34:17,582 --> 01:34:18,783
[SPEAKER_11]: The challenge is that

612
01:34:19,898 --> 01:34:28,660
[SPEAKER_11]: they're the open-ended questions, or the other, where you could then become open-ended, is printed like this.

613
01:34:29,480 --> 01:34:40,722
[SPEAKER_11]: And I at least feel a responsibility, although I don't know that it's technically a responsibility, to at least read them all before dumping them into the public.

614
01:34:40,802 --> 01:34:49,104
[SPEAKER_11]: Because a quick search of a couple of words that you might see in a survey, if you have kids, you've probably seen these kinds of words.

615
01:34:49,857 --> 01:34:54,698
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, personal attacks on staff members, that kind of stuff.

616
01:34:54,718 --> 01:35:07,280
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, I feel like some things deserve to at least have a conversation about whether they should be redacted from the release, or to ask, you know, our lawyer, should this be included in the release?

617
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:10,040
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just have not been able to get through.

618
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:19,362
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, I do believe I released to the committee, I don't remember if I released it to the public, the purely, you know,

619
01:35:20,055 --> 01:35:26,658
[SPEAKER_11]: the statistics kind of stuff, which doesn't have anything interesting, like what percentage were men and women and all that other stuff.

620
01:35:28,720 --> 01:35:32,642
[SPEAKER_11]: So if that hasn't been released, I can certainly release that.

621
01:35:33,322 --> 01:35:39,345
[SPEAKER_11]: But honestly, the important and interesting stuff is not in the numbers.

622
01:35:41,938 --> 01:35:46,459
[SPEAKER_11]: There's just really very little surprising in the numbers, although you should still be able to see them.

623
01:35:47,399 --> 01:35:51,261
[SPEAKER_11]: It's in that really detailed stuff that people had to say.

624
01:35:51,281 --> 01:35:57,362
[SPEAKER_11]: And believe me, people had a lot to say on the 470 responses or so.

625
01:35:58,362 --> 01:36:01,003
[SPEAKER_11]: There was nobody who didn't have a lot to say.

626
01:36:01,123 --> 01:36:04,424
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's what I had to say about the survey.

627
01:36:05,044 --> 01:36:11,146
[SPEAKER_24]: If I could just add on the survey, it was used for the search committee purposes to get the search committee off the ground.

628
01:36:12,390 --> 01:36:17,033
[SPEAKER_24]: Everything that happened in the search committee was executive session, basically, the equivalent of it.

629
01:36:17,453 --> 01:36:23,557
[SPEAKER_24]: So now that we're out, you should turn them over and we can redact if there's something offensive.

630
01:36:24,338 --> 01:36:26,179
[SPEAKER_24]: But otherwise, it's benign.

631
01:36:26,979 --> 01:36:27,139
[SPEAKER_24]: Ms.

632
01:36:27,159 --> 01:36:27,680
[SPEAKER_24]: Van der Kloot?

633
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:31,722
[SPEAKER_14]: Melanie, I just wanted to mention one thing.

634
01:36:31,742 --> 01:36:40,408
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that your call for community and family engagement was heard very much by the school committee and is reflected in the choice of our new superintendent.

635
01:36:41,497 --> 01:36:49,182
[SPEAKER_14]: Certainly, as we went about interviewing people and talking to them, that was a major concern.

636
01:36:49,562 --> 01:37:00,628
[SPEAKER_14]: And in fact, we've picked someone who we feel will be able to broaden family engagement and reach into communities that perhaps have been, not perhaps, but have been underrepresented.

637
01:37:01,449 --> 01:37:09,133
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think that that is an extremely important point and that we heard you very clearly

638
01:37:10,017 --> 01:37:19,082
[SPEAKER_14]: and know that that is a concern that we would like to make sure that we're broadening community and family engagement.

639
01:37:20,062 --> 01:37:28,226
[SPEAKER_14]: By the way, one of the things that you mentioned about the podium and the way you come here, that's one of the reasons why many of us actually prefer committees of the whole, because it's a much more

640
01:37:28,811 --> 01:37:35,776
[SPEAKER_14]: feeling of collaborative discussion when we're around the table versus here, which is a much more formal presentation.

641
01:37:36,257 --> 01:37:41,541
[SPEAKER_14]: And remember, as you speak, part of the thing is your face is to the camera.

642
01:37:42,141 --> 01:37:49,227
[SPEAKER_14]: And so while you're here, it's always awkward because your face is, you know, your back is to the community, but there's the larger community at home.

643
01:37:52,229 --> 01:37:56,052
[SPEAKER_24]: And as far as that meeting, it was a special meeting of the school committee.

644
01:37:56,072 --> 01:37:57,073
[SPEAKER_24]: It was not a committee of the whole,

645
01:37:57,973 --> 01:37:59,094
[SPEAKER_24]: It's a nomenclature, right?

646
01:37:59,134 --> 01:37:59,554
[SPEAKER_24]: Same thing.

647
01:38:00,054 --> 01:38:02,955
[SPEAKER_24]: But that was posted the way all of the meetings were posted.

648
01:38:02,975 --> 01:38:06,077
[SPEAKER_24]: And I know there were some parents that did show up at that meeting.

649
01:38:06,177 --> 01:38:13,040
[SPEAKER_24]: And we held it before the Honor Society meeting, because three of us went over to that right from the end of that meeting.

650
01:38:13,780 --> 01:38:15,841
[SPEAKER_24]: So it was public.

651
01:38:16,161 --> 01:38:19,342
[SPEAKER_24]: It was as public as any other meeting that we hold, just like tonight.

652
01:38:23,284 --> 01:38:23,944
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Ruggiero.

653
01:38:24,344 --> 01:38:25,765
[SPEAKER_10]: How the issue was brought up

654
01:38:27,282 --> 01:38:32,668
[SPEAKER_10]: It was, I was under the impression that we were going to discuss the transition strategy.

655
01:38:33,789 --> 01:38:35,531
[SPEAKER_10]: That is the notice that was made.

656
01:38:36,532 --> 01:38:45,942
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't, it would have probably been more helpful to the community and to me as a member if the discussion was about continuing Roy Belson's contract.

657
01:38:47,700 --> 01:38:56,064
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I wasn't, personally, I wasn't really prepared to have all the reasons and to rehash through the argument other than what I did.

658
01:38:57,584 --> 01:38:58,505
[SPEAKER_10]: But I share your concerns.

659
01:38:59,631 --> 01:39:07,294
[SPEAKER_10]: because I do believe that it was an important decision to make, and I think more community input would have been very helpful, as I made clear during the meeting.

660
01:39:07,314 --> 01:39:20,298
[SPEAKER_24]: Actually, if I could, the meeting posting said the purpose of the meeting is to determine administrative leadership of the school system from May 1st to June 30th, 2018, and to take appropriate actions to implement the same.

661
01:39:20,738 --> 01:39:25,240
[SPEAKER_24]: Further, the school committee may discuss relevant transition plans consistent with the completion

662
01:39:25,758 --> 01:39:27,919
[SPEAKER_24]: of the superintendent search and selection process.

663
01:39:28,119 --> 01:39:36,223
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but it doesn't say that Roy, just a clarification, it does not say that in addition, Roy Bellson's contract may be extended.

664
01:39:36,523 --> 01:39:42,626
[SPEAKER_10]: The idea of the, while what we, I do not claim that what we did was a violation of open meeting law, I don't think so.

665
01:39:42,726 --> 01:39:43,066
[SPEAKER_10]: It wasn't.

666
01:39:43,106 --> 01:39:49,829
[SPEAKER_10]: But it would have been more clear to the community if that issue of Roy Bellson's extended contract was made more clear.

667
01:39:50,909 --> 01:39:51,369
[SPEAKER_03]: And thank you.

668
01:39:51,429 --> 01:39:55,091
[SPEAKER_03]: And Madam Mayor, respectfully, I agree.

669
01:39:55,211 --> 01:40:06,675
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that I didn't go to the meeting myself because I thought that it was a sort of procedural interim, you know, what we were going to do, which I thought was pretty clear that it would likely be deputies.

670
01:40:08,336 --> 01:40:12,998
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, I was uninformed, but it didn't say specifically about Mr. Belson.

671
01:40:13,178 --> 01:40:15,319
[SPEAKER_03]: Had it, I would have been at the meeting.

672
01:40:16,718 --> 01:40:17,299
[SPEAKER_24]: Excuse me.

673
01:40:17,319 --> 01:40:18,440
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that that's the point.

674
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:19,541
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

675
01:40:19,701 --> 01:40:22,163
[SPEAKER_24]: The committee could vote anything that night.

676
01:40:22,183 --> 01:40:24,045
[SPEAKER_24]: It wasn't dictated what was going to happen.

677
01:40:24,065 --> 01:40:24,245
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

678
01:40:24,405 --> 01:40:24,946
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand.

679
01:40:24,966 --> 01:40:25,906
[SPEAKER_03]: I totally understand that.

680
01:40:25,926 --> 01:40:33,353
[SPEAKER_03]: But I guess what I'm saying in the interest of family and community engagement, we didn't hear that and we didn't hear what we needed to hear to be at the meeting.

681
01:40:33,413 --> 01:40:36,476
[SPEAKER_03]: And so from a family perspective, it wasn't communicated effectively.

682
01:40:37,772 --> 01:40:46,057
[SPEAKER_10]: And to add on to that point, I mean, I would like to suggest that these important decisions are made during regular committee meetings.

683
01:40:46,777 --> 01:40:57,702
[SPEAKER_10]: I understand that sometimes we do need to go into executive session or committee of the wholes, but that particular issue should have been televised so the whole community could hear it.

684
01:40:58,643 --> 01:41:04,286
[SPEAKER_10]: It's unfortunate that the community had to sort of hear about it secondhand.

685
01:41:04,346 --> 01:41:06,387
[SPEAKER_10]: It creates an environment of mistrust.

686
01:41:07,862 --> 01:41:08,182
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

687
01:41:08,482 --> 01:41:09,423
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Russo's next.

688
01:41:12,644 --> 01:41:22,248
[SPEAKER_11]: My question, you mentioned about this format, which I don't think anybody actually thinks this is the most enjoyable format, especially that one spot.

689
01:41:22,368 --> 01:41:25,169
[SPEAKER_11]: This is actually much less of a challenge than that spot.

690
01:41:25,529 --> 01:41:36,234
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'm just curious, and I'm not a history teacher, and I have no civics education other than the one I got in high school, but are there other formats for this

691
01:41:37,048 --> 01:41:41,670
[SPEAKER_11]: are implemented in this country that people know of?

692
01:41:41,970 --> 01:41:46,212
[SPEAKER_11]: Or is this really, I mean, I just sort of assume this is the default format everywhere.

693
01:41:47,773 --> 01:41:55,116
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that you look, there can be something as simple as handheld microphones and people could stand at either end and address all of you.

694
01:41:56,157 --> 01:42:01,279
[SPEAKER_03]: It's simple if you think outside of the box a little bit about, well, what feels welcoming and this is not welcoming.

695
01:42:02,220 --> 01:42:02,980
[SPEAKER_03]: It's intimidating.

696
01:42:03,421 --> 01:42:05,723
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what do we do to make somebody feel less intimidated?

697
01:42:05,783 --> 01:42:06,684
[SPEAKER_03]: And I couldn't agree more.

698
01:42:06,704 --> 01:42:09,086
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Dr. Edouard-Vincent is going to be all over that.

699
01:42:09,686 --> 01:42:11,748
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm really happy and very pleased.

700
01:42:11,768 --> 01:42:13,649
[SPEAKER_03]: And thank you all very much for your hard work on that.

701
01:42:13,689 --> 01:42:15,011
[SPEAKER_03]: I know how hard you worked on that.

702
01:42:15,051 --> 01:42:17,933
[SPEAKER_03]: And thank you for the privilege of being on the superintendent search committee.

703
01:42:18,093 --> 01:42:18,914
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a great privilege.

704
01:42:20,075 --> 01:42:20,275
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

705
01:42:20,955 --> 01:42:21,276
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

706
01:42:22,757 --> 01:42:23,477
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Benedetto.

707
01:42:23,658 --> 01:42:23,978
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

708
01:42:24,158 --> 01:42:25,519
[SPEAKER_22]: I actually requested the meeting.

709
01:42:26,380 --> 01:42:28,942
[SPEAKER_22]: I requested the meeting because May 1st was coming.

710
01:42:29,894 --> 01:42:42,578
[SPEAKER_22]: and my understanding that Mr. Belson was retiring as of April 30th, and that we needed to have an official person named as acting superintendent to get us through the transition.

711
01:42:43,198 --> 01:42:57,422
[SPEAKER_22]: So I had no idea that there were other options at play that were gonna be presented that evening, so I too was shocked that this came up at this meeting,

712
01:42:59,435 --> 01:43:13,422
[SPEAKER_22]: I assumed the vote of the committee, and when the committee voted to extend him to April 30th, I took on that as that's my new role, is to support him till that point, and then make sure our district has somebody at the helm.

713
01:43:14,102 --> 01:43:16,343
[SPEAKER_22]: So I really pushed to have this meeting.

714
01:43:18,324 --> 01:43:25,648
[SPEAKER_22]: So it was a little quicker than some, and it was a special meeting to discuss it, my understanding that is

715
01:43:26,212 --> 01:43:38,877
[SPEAKER_22]: someone within the district would step into that role, whether a deputy, a principal, someone we felt confident, you know, to help us through because Mr. Belson was also going to be present.

716
01:43:39,337 --> 01:43:48,140
[SPEAKER_22]: And knowing him, as we all do, we know he works way beyond the hours required, and he was being contracted to continue for 25 hours.

717
01:43:48,440 --> 01:43:52,962
[SPEAKER_22]: So he was accessible to help with any bigger issues, and I'm sure

718
01:43:53,443 --> 01:43:58,646
[SPEAKER_22]: with his dedication to this community over all these years, that he would wholeheartedly do that.

719
01:43:59,926 --> 01:44:06,930
[SPEAKER_22]: So I honestly was shocked by the outcome of that meeting.

720
01:44:08,090 --> 01:44:10,772
[SPEAKER_22]: It didn't even enter my mind as a possibility.

721
01:44:11,272 --> 01:44:21,177
[SPEAKER_22]: Had I thought that that was a possibility, I would have, like I do usually, hey, important things are being discussed and put it on social media, please come.

722
01:44:22,120 --> 01:44:28,401
[SPEAKER_22]: right, please come, or I would have requested that the meeting be televised, because I have done that also in the past.

723
01:44:29,061 --> 01:44:33,482
[SPEAKER_22]: And I know we're getting new cameras in different areas, so we can do that.

724
01:44:34,902 --> 01:44:38,183
[SPEAKER_22]: Because transparency is extremely important.

725
01:44:39,043 --> 01:44:49,405
[SPEAKER_22]: And people not finding out important information online is, they feel insulted to find it out that way.

726
01:44:52,209 --> 01:45:06,023
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know what to say about the outcome of the meeting, but I can own that I did bring it forward and did not tell a push for it to be, because I thought it was just an interest, you know, an interim person stepping in for two months.

727
01:45:07,084 --> 01:45:07,444
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

728
01:45:07,544 --> 01:45:07,704
[SPEAKER_24]: Ms.

729
01:45:07,744 --> 01:45:08,105
[SPEAKER_24]: Mustone.

730
01:45:08,425 --> 01:45:11,488
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Maribel.

731
01:45:11,808 --> 01:45:16,693
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know about everyone, but likewise, I thought someone who was in administration was going to step in.

732
01:45:17,405 --> 01:45:19,766
[SPEAKER_08]: not realizing that's not in their contract.

733
01:45:19,886 --> 01:45:32,232
[SPEAKER_08]: So when we did receive multiple angry emails that night and the next morning, I did respond saying, I went in assuming, shame on me, that someone in administration would step into that role per contract.

734
01:45:32,692 --> 01:45:39,395
[SPEAKER_08]: The other option was that the Massachusetts Association School Committees can take someone almost like an emergency superintendent.

735
01:45:39,956 --> 01:45:45,098
[SPEAKER_08]: So to me, having a middle man or middle woman come in for eight weeks, try to transition,

736
01:45:45,935 --> 01:45:50,318
[SPEAKER_08]: while we have, I almost feel like Dr. Maurice is like the Phoenix out of the ashes.

737
01:45:50,418 --> 01:45:54,040
[SPEAKER_08]: Like this is going to be a whole new public school system.

738
01:45:54,840 --> 01:46:11,309
[SPEAKER_08]: And I did not think that was the best choice to have a middle person, um, that I think Mr. Velson is, has the knowledge and the history to give our new superintendent and just looking forward that we needed that transition to be smoothly done.

739
01:46:11,329 --> 01:46:11,390
[SPEAKER_08]: And,

740
01:46:12,884 --> 01:46:20,687
[SPEAKER_08]: I know people don't agree with that, but I think it would have been more detrimental to our school system to bring someone in for eight weeks, and I stand by that decision.

741
01:46:21,527 --> 01:46:22,127
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Tseng.

742
01:46:22,147 --> 01:46:26,329
[SPEAKER_24]: Do you have a microphone there?

743
01:46:26,569 --> 01:46:26,829
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't.

744
01:46:26,889 --> 01:46:29,030
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, step up.

745
01:46:29,490 --> 01:46:29,950
[SPEAKER_24]: There you go.

746
01:46:31,651 --> 01:46:41,034
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay, well, I thank you for coming up and saying what a lot of our community is thinking and has been thinking throughout the past few years.

747
01:46:41,847 --> 01:46:50,233
[SPEAKER_23]: And I'll say, when I read the notice for that meeting, I also didn't take it as you would take the vote that you took.

748
01:46:51,193 --> 01:46:54,876
[SPEAKER_23]: And a lot of adults didn't take it that way either.

749
01:46:55,276 --> 01:46:59,259
[SPEAKER_23]: And I think the notice did say exactly what the meeting would be about.

750
01:46:59,639 --> 01:47:00,220
[SPEAKER_23]: It didn't lie.

751
01:47:00,280 --> 01:47:01,240
[SPEAKER_23]: There were no lies in it.

752
01:47:01,721 --> 01:47:02,901
[SPEAKER_23]: It stated the truth.

753
01:47:03,382 --> 01:47:07,004
[SPEAKER_23]: But there's a part of it that includes communication.

754
01:47:09,133 --> 01:47:14,296
[SPEAKER_23]: communicating to school committee members, to the general public about what the meeting might entail.

755
01:47:14,796 --> 01:47:20,440
[SPEAKER_23]: And because of laws, you can't talk outside of a meeting.

756
01:47:20,460 --> 01:47:22,421
[SPEAKER_23]: That's the problem.

757
01:47:22,861 --> 01:47:26,523
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, and that's a huge problem that acts as a roadblock.

758
01:47:26,583 --> 01:47:37,069
[SPEAKER_23]: But maybe allowing the public to know via social media, which you guys are all very good about, but to know via social media what

759
01:47:37,910 --> 01:47:41,471
[SPEAKER_23]: might happen in a meeting, and to tell people, come.

760
01:47:41,631 --> 01:47:42,391
[SPEAKER_23]: Come to this meeting.

761
01:47:42,811 --> 01:47:44,132
[SPEAKER_23]: I think that really helps out.

762
01:47:44,972 --> 01:47:55,795
[SPEAKER_23]: I'll say, from the student perspective, when we read that on Facebook, or when our friends texted the news, there were two reactions, generally.

763
01:47:56,075 --> 01:47:59,056
[SPEAKER_23]: One was, what the heck?

764
01:47:59,536 --> 01:48:01,016
[SPEAKER_23]: How did this just suddenly happen?

765
01:48:01,456 --> 01:48:05,297
[SPEAKER_23]: And the other reaction was, oh, he was in for it.

766
01:48:05,477 --> 01:48:07,178
[SPEAKER_23]: We knew that this would happen anyways.

767
01:48:07,987 --> 01:48:11,490
[SPEAKER_23]: And, you know, both reactions aren't positive for our community.

768
01:48:11,591 --> 01:48:16,956
[SPEAKER_23]: It's not positive for the school community, not positive for the general public, not positive for Mr. Bellson and his leadership.

769
01:48:17,857 --> 01:48:20,259
[SPEAKER_23]: And I think a more open culture.

770
01:48:21,673 --> 01:48:30,318
[SPEAKER_23]: the so-called new Medford, I think that's what we want to try and foster, what we want to try and sponsor, and how we deal with these issues going on.

771
01:48:30,818 --> 01:48:47,727
[SPEAKER_23]: So being more open about what meetings might entail, and even, I would say, try more to advertise the committee of the whole meetings, because they're kind of put aside, and they allow for a more relaxed context, but I think it's important for people to know that these are important meetings,

772
01:48:49,272 --> 01:48:51,074
[SPEAKER_23]: important stuff gets done in these meetings.

773
01:48:51,194 --> 01:48:52,455
[SPEAKER_23]: I think that's super important.

774
01:48:53,396 --> 01:48:56,078
[SPEAKER_23]: And I know Mr. Rousseau does this.

775
01:48:56,138 --> 01:48:57,259
[SPEAKER_23]: He does town halls.

776
01:48:57,439 --> 01:48:59,861
[SPEAKER_23]: He does meet the school committee member.

777
01:49:00,281 --> 01:49:04,344
[SPEAKER_23]: And I think that's a great way for people in the community to engage with school committee members.

778
01:49:04,565 --> 01:49:09,008
[SPEAKER_23]: So I say we have to take a step back, look at the bigger issue.

779
01:49:09,028 --> 01:49:09,729
[SPEAKER_23]: It's about trust.

780
01:49:10,690 --> 01:49:14,533
[SPEAKER_23]: And we need to build that trust between the general public and the Medford School Committee.

781
01:49:14,573 --> 01:49:17,115
[SPEAKER_23]: And there's trust, but it can be stronger.

782
01:49:18,331 --> 01:49:19,091
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Justin.

783
01:49:19,912 --> 01:49:21,052
[SPEAKER_03]: Very eloquent, Justin.

784
01:49:21,072 --> 01:49:24,794
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

785
01:49:24,834 --> 01:49:24,994
[SPEAKER_04]: Ms.

786
01:49:25,034 --> 01:49:26,635
[SPEAKER_04]: Kreatz.

787
01:49:26,815 --> 01:49:47,504
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, so I, too, that night, I knew we were having a meeting, and we hadn't been able to talk about who would be the interim superintendent, so we got to talk that night, and I thought maybe somebody would be stepping up into that place, but we did have to make a decision in the best interest of everybody, like the students and the staffing,

788
01:49:48,122 --> 01:49:50,823
[SPEAKER_04]: while we waited to hire our new superintendent.

789
01:49:50,883 --> 01:50:03,607
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, I stand by my decision, and it was more of in the best interest of the schools and the students to keeping, you know, so we would have the training until the end of the school year.

790
01:50:03,627 --> 01:50:07,528
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I have been getting a lot of questions from parents, who's gonna be the superintendent?

791
01:50:07,968 --> 01:50:09,269
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's also been confusion.

792
01:50:09,689 --> 01:50:11,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people thought we already hired a superintendent.

793
01:50:12,110 --> 01:50:14,310
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's just been a little bit of confusion all around.

794
01:50:15,631 --> 01:50:16,411
[SPEAKER_04]: But so,

795
01:50:17,105 --> 01:50:20,266
[SPEAKER_04]: I stand by the decision that I made that night, as well.

796
01:50:20,586 --> 01:50:21,086
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Ms.

797
01:50:21,106 --> 01:50:21,366
[SPEAKER_24]: Kreatz.

798
01:50:21,586 --> 01:50:22,307
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Benedetto?

799
01:50:22,427 --> 01:50:23,647
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you so much, Mayburg.

800
01:50:24,107 --> 01:50:32,049
[SPEAKER_22]: I still have some questions, so I need some transparency and clarity on what exactly the superintendent's role is for the rest of this year.

801
01:50:32,450 --> 01:50:37,611
[SPEAKER_22]: Will he have whole power as the superintendent?

802
01:50:37,651 --> 01:50:43,733
[SPEAKER_22]: Will he be hiring and moving people and promoting people and providing raises?

803
01:50:44,200 --> 01:50:49,702
[SPEAKER_22]: And I also heard a few rumors that he's telling people that he's going to be here beyond June 30th.

804
01:50:50,443 --> 01:50:51,823
[SPEAKER_22]: Is that a possibility?

805
01:50:51,923 --> 01:50:54,064
[SPEAKER_22]: Is there something about that happening?

806
01:50:54,644 --> 01:50:59,987
[SPEAKER_22]: I just want to put it all out here while we're on camera and everybody's in the room.

807
01:51:00,607 --> 01:51:05,449
[SPEAKER_22]: I just have these general questions and if someone could answer them for me and any other questions that come up.

808
01:51:06,149 --> 01:51:12,752
[SPEAKER_22]: I just want to know are the rules we put in place in February for him to continue to April 30th still in place?

809
01:51:13,387 --> 01:51:16,049
[SPEAKER_22]: or have they been removed?

810
01:51:16,149 --> 01:51:18,411
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm really not sure what we voted for that night.

811
01:51:18,851 --> 01:51:21,553
[SPEAKER_24]: None of those other restrictions have been removed.

812
01:51:22,254 --> 01:51:33,462
[SPEAKER_22]: So he cannot hire people or move people or give raises or promotions unless it's like something to just provide services till June 30th.

813
01:51:33,603 --> 01:51:40,628
[SPEAKER_22]: Anything beyond that, our new superintendent would be making those choices like department heads and all of that.

814
01:51:41,268 --> 01:51:42,069
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, of course.

815
01:51:42,550 --> 01:51:54,641
[SPEAKER_22]: And the rumors that I'm hearing that he's telling people that he might be staying past June 30th, has anybody talked to him about doing any consulting beyond that point?

816
01:51:55,842 --> 01:51:58,104
[SPEAKER_22]: No, this body has not talked about that.

817
01:51:58,864 --> 01:51:59,024
[SPEAKER_14]: Ms.

818
01:51:59,044 --> 01:52:00,586
[SPEAKER_14]: Van der Kloot.

819
01:52:00,606 --> 01:52:08,733
[SPEAKER_14]: Mayor Burke, I just think that there may be positions that we want the superintendent to move on, and so I'm not,

820
01:52:09,442 --> 01:52:10,762
[SPEAKER_14]: excluding that as a potential.

821
01:52:10,822 --> 01:52:12,143
[SPEAKER_14]: But they have to be reviewed by us.

822
01:52:12,243 --> 01:52:15,203
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, but they would be, we would be part of that discussion.

823
01:52:15,463 --> 01:52:24,565
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, of course, you know, um, and you know, I think the superintendent has made it very clear that he would also want to include, uh, the superintendent elect as well.

824
01:52:25,285 --> 01:52:37,068
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, but to say there's going to be nothing happening to, um, until July 1st, I don't want that to be, um, the feeling there, there, there certainly needs to be movement.

825
01:52:37,428 --> 01:52:37,968
[SPEAKER_14]: For instance,

826
01:52:38,577 --> 01:52:43,882
[SPEAKER_14]: we might very well want to solidify our principal at the McGlynn, for example.

827
01:52:45,244 --> 01:52:47,046
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't want to wait until July 1st to do that.

828
01:52:47,246 --> 01:52:51,170
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, I would like to see the new superintendent make those choices.

829
01:52:51,590 --> 01:52:58,877
[SPEAKER_22]: If that superintendent told us that they had flexibility in coming forward, I'm sure Mr. Belson can give

830
01:53:00,648 --> 01:53:11,874
[SPEAKER_22]: the information, but the final decision, even restructuring of the central administration, you know, putting those positions back in place, I think that should be the new superintendent's place.

831
01:53:12,214 --> 01:53:20,838
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't think that a new superintendent should step in and, you know, have to work with what's been hired from an outgoing superintendent.

832
01:53:21,178 --> 01:53:26,361
[SPEAKER_22]: His input can be done by June 30th, and then the new superintendent should have the final decision.

833
01:53:27,415 --> 01:53:29,697
[SPEAKER_24]: We have positions like director of foreign language.

834
01:53:30,417 --> 01:53:32,799
[SPEAKER_24]: Interviews are scheduled to begin.

835
01:53:32,819 --> 01:53:34,260
[SPEAKER_24]: It's already been posted.

836
01:53:34,280 --> 01:53:35,761
[SPEAKER_24]: We have applications in.

837
01:53:36,621 --> 01:53:39,924
[SPEAKER_24]: Neil from City Hall on diversity is going to be sitting in on the interviews.

838
01:53:40,504 --> 01:53:42,826
[SPEAKER_24]: And then when they make a recommendation, it will come to us.

839
01:53:43,393 --> 01:53:44,274
[SPEAKER_24]: We need to move forward.

840
01:53:44,314 --> 01:53:46,736
[SPEAKER_24]: We cannot just go into freeze.

841
01:53:46,936 --> 01:53:48,417
[SPEAKER_21]: These sirens are going off everywhere.

842
01:53:48,537 --> 01:53:53,081
[SPEAKER_21]: Is there a way to include the new superintendent-elect in those?

843
01:53:53,101 --> 01:53:55,402
[SPEAKER_24]: I asked her the other night if I could.

844
01:53:55,763 --> 01:54:03,389
[SPEAKER_24]: I asked her the other evening if she would have an opportunity to assist us, and she said she would try to the best of her ability.

845
01:54:03,409 --> 01:54:04,770
[SPEAKER_24]: This is before we offer her the position.

846
01:54:05,310 --> 01:54:11,415
[SPEAKER_24]: That she has a commitment to Boston through the end of the year, but she would make every effort to rearrange her schedule so that she could

847
01:54:12,347 --> 01:54:15,908
[SPEAKER_24]: help us get through things and possibly even be part of the budget process.

848
01:54:16,368 --> 01:54:20,829
[SPEAKER_22]: So, Mayor Burke, can I answer that question about the director of foreign language?

849
01:54:20,909 --> 01:54:32,033
[SPEAKER_22]: For instance, so say the new superintendent wants our foreign languages to develop in a different road than we currently have in MEDFED.

850
01:54:33,133 --> 01:54:34,513
[SPEAKER_22]: Maybe a different language.

851
01:54:35,053 --> 01:54:40,055
[SPEAKER_22]: So say the new director of foreign language teaches

852
01:54:42,033 --> 01:54:46,260
[SPEAKER_22]: a program that we might not be moving forward for for the next five years.

853
01:54:46,721 --> 01:54:54,114
[SPEAKER_22]: I would hate for that to happen when the new superintendent, like she talked about Mandarin in one of her interviews, I remember her.

854
01:54:55,135 --> 01:54:55,955
[SPEAKER_22]: speaking about that.

855
01:54:56,175 --> 01:55:02,757
[SPEAKER_22]: So she might have a new direction and new programs in her mind of how to move MedFit forward.

856
01:55:02,797 --> 01:55:13,100
[SPEAKER_22]: And if we hire someone in a role that has what we currently have and what not our future is going to be, we could be tying our hands.

857
01:55:13,400 --> 01:55:18,621
[SPEAKER_22]: So that's why the importance of not hiring directors are important to me.

858
01:55:18,741 --> 01:55:20,502
[SPEAKER_22]: So I really would like

859
01:55:21,616 --> 01:55:41,350
[SPEAKER_22]: to either let her make those decisions on, you know, bring the finalists to her, maybe do the preliminary work, but really have some more input from the new superintendent and what her vision for our school district is gonna be rather than the outgoing superintendent, and someone have to work within those restraints.

860
01:55:41,450 --> 01:55:43,111
[SPEAKER_24]: What we have to wait.

861
01:55:43,311 --> 01:55:44,272
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Superintendent.

862
01:55:45,675 --> 01:55:51,702
[SPEAKER_29]: So let me try to address this a little bit so we can clarify these things for everyone's benefit.

863
01:55:52,843 --> 01:55:57,988
[SPEAKER_29]: I have had a very extensive conversation with Dr. Edouard-Vincent.

864
01:55:58,849 --> 01:56:01,072
[SPEAKER_29]: She met with us before she toured our schools.

865
01:56:02,170 --> 01:56:16,539
[SPEAKER_29]: We had a good exchange of ideas of what was necessary to happen so that when she came aboard, she wouldn't be mired in doing a lot of functional and organizational things that would take an extraordinary amount of time.

866
01:56:18,401 --> 01:56:20,282
[SPEAKER_29]: We have a number of open positions.

867
01:56:21,743 --> 01:56:30,929
[SPEAKER_29]: Any departmental position that got hired would be subject to the professional status law, which means they only have one year.

868
01:56:32,987 --> 01:56:36,888
[SPEAKER_29]: So if, in fact, they did get hired, they could be replaced within that one year.

869
01:56:38,008 --> 01:56:45,630
[SPEAKER_29]: The second piece is that to leave all these things for an individual to come in would destabilize the school system.

870
01:56:45,890 --> 01:56:47,250
[SPEAKER_29]: We have after school programs.

871
01:56:47,270 --> 01:56:49,451
[SPEAKER_29]: A director of early childhood is leaving.

872
01:56:49,531 --> 01:56:51,011
[SPEAKER_29]: They run the after school programs.

873
01:56:51,031 --> 01:56:53,232
[SPEAKER_29]: They oversee the family network.

874
01:56:53,652 --> 01:56:55,252
[SPEAKER_29]: All these things have to be taken care of.

875
01:56:56,052 --> 01:56:58,453
[SPEAKER_29]: I can assure you that the mayor

876
01:56:59,112 --> 01:57:05,617
[SPEAKER_29]: And I have talked considerably about including people in the discussions, including Mr. Osborne, so we can promote diversity.

877
01:57:07,138 --> 01:57:13,283
[SPEAKER_29]: But I can assure you that the way we hire administrators is they always come before you, remember?

878
01:57:13,743 --> 01:57:15,284
[SPEAKER_29]: These major administrative positions.

879
01:57:16,045 --> 01:57:17,146
[SPEAKER_29]: And you get a chance to input.

880
01:57:18,207 --> 01:57:22,029
[SPEAKER_29]: And I'm sure that Dr. Edouard-Vincent will have every opportunity to input.

881
01:57:22,630 --> 01:57:26,253
[SPEAKER_29]: But if we stop our business right now, in July,

882
01:57:27,580 --> 01:57:35,147
[SPEAKER_29]: Our successor is going to have one heck of a responsibility to put things together in two months, less than two months before school opens.

883
01:57:35,967 --> 01:57:37,789
[SPEAKER_29]: And that's not a desirable outcome.

884
01:57:38,830 --> 01:57:43,954
[SPEAKER_29]: Secondly, there are a whole pile of responsibilities with teachers and other things of that type.

885
01:57:44,615 --> 01:57:49,098
[SPEAKER_29]: Leaves of absence, maternities, all kinds of things that have to be dealt with.

886
01:57:50,760 --> 01:57:51,560
[SPEAKER_29]: Got to be dealt with.

887
01:57:52,221 --> 01:57:54,163
[SPEAKER_29]: You don't want to drop that on your new person.

888
01:57:55,697 --> 01:57:57,758
[SPEAKER_29]: I can assure you that you're going to be involved.

889
01:57:59,339 --> 01:58:04,863
[SPEAKER_29]: I can assure you that Dr. Edouard-Vincent's going to be involved, because I'm rooting for her success.

890
01:58:05,243 --> 01:58:05,944
[SPEAKER_29]: That's what I do.

891
01:58:07,525 --> 01:58:08,645
[SPEAKER_29]: I want to finish strong.

892
01:58:09,586 --> 01:58:20,053
[SPEAKER_29]: The only reason I'm needing to stay on is because there is a gap, not because I wouldn't have something to do if I wasn't in this role.

893
01:58:21,394 --> 01:58:22,955
[SPEAKER_29]: As Mrs. DiBenedetto pointed out,

894
01:58:24,382 --> 01:58:26,343
[SPEAKER_29]: I probably wouldn't work 25 hours a week.

895
01:58:26,383 --> 01:58:28,583
[SPEAKER_29]: I'd probably work 80 hours a week or 60 hours a week.

896
01:58:30,384 --> 01:58:31,464
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm going to work it anyway.

897
01:58:33,045 --> 01:58:44,369
[SPEAKER_29]: But having the level of authority to do what needs to be done, to put things in place, to handle the collective bargaining that has to go on at this point in time is in your best interest.

898
01:58:45,889 --> 01:58:51,051
[SPEAKER_29]: I can sit back, not do anything, but that means my successor

899
01:58:52,124 --> 01:58:53,505
[SPEAKER_29]: is gonna have an awful lot to do.

900
01:58:54,145 --> 01:59:02,571
[SPEAKER_29]: I would rather she comes in to a stable environment and have the opportunity to move her ideas and programs forward, and I will root for her.

901
01:59:03,492 --> 01:59:06,654
[SPEAKER_29]: And I will work with her and give her as much support as she needs.

902
01:59:08,235 --> 01:59:20,844
[SPEAKER_29]: But not to take care of the routine business of this school system, not to ensure that the partnership, some of the things that are on tonight's agenda, won't go forward, would be a disservice to you, to the community, and to her.

903
01:59:21,959 --> 01:59:26,743
[SPEAKER_29]: So I respectfully request that you allow me to do what I have to do.

904
01:59:27,683 --> 01:59:29,545
[SPEAKER_29]: I can assure you that you'll be involved.

905
01:59:30,225 --> 01:59:32,226
[SPEAKER_29]: I can assure you that she will be involved.

906
01:59:32,747 --> 01:59:47,658
[SPEAKER_29]: And I can assure you that any decision we make will be something that's collaborative and not an individual decision on my part, except for the routine kinds of things that have to happen day to day to keep the school system in place.

907
01:59:48,438 --> 01:59:50,380
[SPEAKER_29]: So I appreciate your concerns.

908
01:59:51,349 --> 01:59:53,811
[SPEAKER_29]: I want to assure you that that's my intent.

909
01:59:54,391 --> 01:59:55,892
[SPEAKER_29]: Let's finish strong together.

910
01:59:56,073 --> 01:59:57,534
[SPEAKER_29]: Let's have a good balanced budget.

911
01:59:58,134 --> 01:59:59,896
[SPEAKER_29]: Let's put a budget together next year.

912
02:00:00,356 --> 02:00:10,163
[SPEAKER_29]: That's going to be reflective of the things that you want to see and that will give our new superintendent an opportunity to innovate and do the things that will make the school system move forward.

913
02:00:10,183 --> 02:00:12,625
[SPEAKER_29]: I appreciate you listening.

914
02:00:13,246 --> 02:00:13,986
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Benedetto.

915
02:00:14,387 --> 02:00:15,327
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, a few things.

916
02:00:15,708 --> 02:00:18,450
[SPEAKER_22]: Number one, can we get a list of those positions that, um,

917
02:00:19,788 --> 02:00:25,791
[SPEAKER_22]: are necessary to move forward so that—I know we asked for a list of retirements.

918
02:00:26,152 --> 02:00:47,063
[SPEAKER_22]: It wasn't added to the back of the agenda for reports, so we had asked for a list of retirements or open positions for next year, so that would be helpful for us to know what interviews are happening, what's going on, because, like, I did not have any idea that those interviews were happening for the foreign language department at this point.

919
02:00:48,500 --> 02:00:50,201
[SPEAKER_22]: That would be helpful as committee.

920
02:00:50,842 --> 02:00:58,208
[SPEAKER_22]: Also, I'd like to, through you, to address the superintendent about the rumors that he plans on staying after June 30th.

921
02:00:58,288 --> 02:01:00,210
[SPEAKER_22]: Is that your intention, Mr. Belson?

922
02:01:01,471 --> 02:01:01,851
[SPEAKER_16]: Rumors?

923
02:01:03,312 --> 02:01:03,853
[SPEAKER_22]: Reporting on rumors.

924
02:01:04,073 --> 02:01:07,255
[SPEAKER_29]: The world is filled with rumortism, and that paralyzes everyone.

925
02:01:08,476 --> 02:01:11,599
[SPEAKER_29]: The reality is that this is my community.

926
02:01:12,400 --> 02:01:15,442
[SPEAKER_29]: If my community needs me to help, I'll be available.

927
02:01:15,902 --> 02:01:17,784
[SPEAKER_29]: If my community doesn't need me to help,

928
02:01:18,610 --> 02:01:23,352
[SPEAKER_29]: with or without compensation, of course, then that won't be there.

929
02:01:23,913 --> 02:01:25,273
[SPEAKER_29]: I certainly won't be intrusive.

930
02:01:25,834 --> 02:01:31,457
[SPEAKER_29]: But I've got to believe that a new superintendent is going to have a lot of questions once they get into the weeds.

931
02:01:33,258 --> 02:01:34,338
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm a phone call away.

932
02:01:34,798 --> 02:01:35,759
[SPEAKER_29]: I live down the street.

933
02:01:36,179 --> 02:01:39,521
[SPEAKER_29]: And I'm more than happy to help, because this is my community.

934
02:01:40,341 --> 02:01:47,505
[SPEAKER_29]: I've been superintendent and been in the school system longer than some people in this room have been alive.

935
02:01:48,327 --> 02:01:49,507
[SPEAKER_29]: And this is my community.

936
02:01:50,248 --> 02:01:52,648
[SPEAKER_29]: And I don't intend to reject my community.

937
02:01:53,048 --> 02:01:55,069
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't intend to walk away from my community.

938
02:01:56,349 --> 02:02:04,892
[SPEAKER_29]: But I don't expect, necessarily, that I would ever intrude on the prerogatives of my successor, on the school committee, or anyone else.

939
02:02:05,652 --> 02:02:06,572
[SPEAKER_29]: But will I be helpful?

940
02:02:06,953 --> 02:02:07,553
[SPEAKER_29]: Of course I will.

941
02:02:08,093 --> 02:02:11,594
[SPEAKER_29]: I expect the school system to build on a very firm foundation.

942
02:02:12,314 --> 02:02:14,695
[SPEAKER_29]: I expect the school system to progress and do well.

943
02:02:16,035 --> 02:02:23,569
[SPEAKER_29]: So I'm not walking away, but I'm not intruding, and I'm available if I'm needed, and I will help wherever I can.

944
02:02:24,551 --> 02:02:24,931
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

945
02:02:26,073 --> 02:02:26,294
[SPEAKER_24]: Ms.

946
02:02:26,314 --> 02:02:27,756
[SPEAKER_24]: Van der Kloot, are you all set?

947
02:02:27,776 --> 02:02:27,917
[SPEAKER_24]: No.

948
02:02:27,957 --> 02:02:28,077
[SPEAKER_24]: Yep.

949
02:02:32,785 --> 02:02:38,253
[SPEAKER_10]: I wanted to address a couple of the other points that we've sort of moved past, including the public records requests.

950
02:02:38,894 --> 02:02:47,326
[SPEAKER_10]: It's important that the public, as being a public body, we are under all the laws that govern public requests.

951
02:02:47,947 --> 02:02:54,014
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have a subcommittee of community relations, but I think this issue is sort of, I would like to have all the members present.

952
02:02:54,174 --> 02:03:03,685
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'd like to make a motion that we have a committee of the whole meeting where we can address, go through all of the items that are important, including maybe having a mic stand in the back corner.

953
02:03:04,366 --> 02:03:07,550
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, if there is a disabled person, we could just hand them the mic.

954
02:03:08,598 --> 02:03:12,180
[SPEAKER_10]: or talking about public requests, where all these issues can be addressed.

955
02:03:12,360 --> 02:03:17,202
[SPEAKER_10]: So like I said, to make a motion that we have a committee of the whole meeting to address all community engagements.

956
02:03:28,148 --> 02:03:33,569
[SPEAKER_24]: But there is an individual at the school that is responsible and at the city that's responsible on our side as well.

957
02:03:33,589 --> 02:03:33,789
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

958
02:03:33,909 --> 02:03:39,430
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I've made public requests and people have been very helpful, but it's unacceptable that emails bounce.

959
02:03:39,570 --> 02:03:44,871
[SPEAKER_10]: But beyond that, there are other issues that we need to discuss about community engagement, community relation.

960
02:03:44,911 --> 02:03:46,091
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd like to do that as a body.

961
02:03:46,411 --> 02:03:47,252
[SPEAKER_10]: So that'd be my motion.

962
02:03:48,652 --> 02:03:49,252
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Russo.

963
02:03:50,632 --> 02:03:54,333
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you be clear as to what this meeting would do and be about?

964
02:03:54,828 --> 02:03:59,131
[SPEAKER_11]: because we just had a conversation about an agenda item that was too vague for people.

965
02:03:59,672 --> 02:04:05,616
[SPEAKER_11]: So once people read this agenda, they need to know whether they care and they're gonna go there.

966
02:04:06,096 --> 02:04:12,962
[SPEAKER_11]: So this list, that's not anywhere good enough in my mind to vote for a meeting.

967
02:04:13,102 --> 02:04:20,347
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we can work with the chair and just sort of add items on the agenda, like we normally would when we have a meeting request.

968
02:04:21,048 --> 02:04:23,730
[SPEAKER_10]: But basically, the broad outline would be

969
02:04:24,575 --> 02:04:27,959
[SPEAKER_10]: how to discuss increasing community engagement on the school committee.

970
02:04:28,099 --> 02:04:30,241
[SPEAKER_24]: That is exactly what this committee is about.

971
02:04:30,341 --> 02:04:32,123
[SPEAKER_24]: So it really does belong with the committee.

972
02:04:33,124 --> 02:04:35,026
[SPEAKER_24]: And we follow Robert's Rules of Order.

973
02:04:35,607 --> 02:04:38,450
[SPEAKER_24]: And that's how we conduct our meetings here, these public meetings.

974
02:04:38,530 --> 02:04:39,971
[SPEAKER_24]: It's all through Robert's Rules of Order.

975
02:04:41,072 --> 02:04:42,554
[SPEAKER_24]: So that's the structure.

976
02:04:42,574 --> 02:04:46,138
[SPEAKER_24]: And most formal committees adopt those standards.

977
02:04:48,541 --> 02:05:02,790
[SPEAKER_21]: Can I just continue with what we also wanted to speak about, and something that I brought to your attention two years ago, and if it had been properly acted upon, we would not really be in the situation we're in right now.

978
02:05:03,731 --> 02:05:09,314
[SPEAKER_21]: And two years ago, I did ask for a solid succession plan for the superintendent position.

979
02:05:10,055 --> 02:05:16,499
[SPEAKER_21]: At the time, I do believe it was misconstrued, and people thought it was simply me saying about Mr. Bellison, but it wasn't.

980
02:05:16,519 --> 02:05:17,760
[SPEAKER_21]: It could have been anybody sitting up there.

981
02:05:19,173 --> 02:05:23,475
[SPEAKER_21]: And now we're poised to hire a new superintendent and there's still no plan.

982
02:05:24,536 --> 02:05:37,882
[SPEAKER_21]: I felt at the time the request was definitely belittled and ultimately the plan that was presented included the scenario we're actually placed in now where there's an untimely or unexpected vacancy.

983
02:05:38,422 --> 02:05:42,944
[SPEAKER_21]: And I just want to read exactly what the plan that was put forth actually says.

984
02:05:42,964 --> 02:05:47,586
[SPEAKER_21]: It says, if the superintendent is unable to perform his duties for any reason,

985
02:05:48,306 --> 02:05:51,468
[SPEAKER_21]: the deputy superintendent would become the interim superintendent.

986
02:05:52,849 --> 02:05:56,071
[SPEAKER_21]: And then it goes on, but we wouldn't have to do a school committee search, obviously.

987
02:05:56,652 --> 02:06:04,757
[SPEAKER_21]: The current school system administration is an experienced team that can handle transition and maintain operations for an extended period of time.

988
02:06:05,518 --> 02:06:14,404
[SPEAKER_21]: We have an assistant superintendent, director of finance and administration, director of pupil services, director of building and grounds, as well as assistant principals,

989
02:06:15,194 --> 02:06:16,715
[SPEAKER_21]: and departmental directors in place.

990
02:06:16,915 --> 02:06:19,237
[SPEAKER_21]: Each would be able to carry out their essential functions.

991
02:06:20,578 --> 02:06:33,547
[SPEAKER_21]: So with that being said, I'm not really sure why we're in a situation where we had to reverse a decision if this is what was put forth as the succession plan.

992
02:06:34,368 --> 02:06:44,255
[SPEAKER_21]: If a proper plan had been in place, I don't think it could have been proposed or justified that your decision was reversed because of a lack of a succession plan.

993
02:06:45,535 --> 02:06:49,510
[SPEAKER_21]: or that their people that were supposed to be taxed with the job were not available to do so.

994
02:06:51,757 --> 02:06:59,520
[SPEAKER_21]: Ultimately, I think it just highlights what our community is feeling, that we're not being heard, that you're unwilling to actually be proactive.

995
02:06:59,560 --> 02:07:06,303
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, it was almost exactly two years ago that I asked for something to be done, and it's still not done.

996
02:07:06,523 --> 02:07:12,366
[SPEAKER_21]: And now we're hiring a new superintendent, and we're still going to be at ground zero for what happens.

997
02:07:13,387 --> 02:07:15,508
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, we know now what a search involves.

998
02:07:16,695 --> 02:07:25,397
[SPEAKER_21]: and we know what we want, but all of this needs to be in place before, I believe, before Mr. Belson leaves because you're obviously going to need his input.

999
02:07:26,217 --> 02:07:33,879
[SPEAKER_21]: So what I'm asking for you tonight is an actual commitment and a date to have an actual solid succession plan.

1000
02:07:35,100 --> 02:07:39,961
[SPEAKER_21]: Like I said, I believe Mr. Belson's input will be invaluable because there's just a lot of policy and

1001
02:07:40,658 --> 02:07:43,719
[SPEAKER_21]: knowledge in his head that needs to be put in writing somewhere.

1002
02:07:44,620 --> 02:07:50,302
[SPEAKER_21]: There's boilerplate plans that you can get that are fairly inexpensive that can sort of bring this along more quickly.

1003
02:07:51,242 --> 02:08:04,407
[SPEAKER_21]: Ultimately it needs to be done now and it all just ties back to a better engagement of engaging your community and like I said, I know I was belittled and it's just a lack of respect for community participation.

1004
02:08:04,487 --> 02:08:09,089
[SPEAKER_21]: It's the we know better, how dare you ask, we can handle it.

1005
02:08:10,248 --> 02:08:11,009
[SPEAKER_21]: And that's unfortunate.

1006
02:08:12,330 --> 02:08:12,470
[SPEAKER_24]: Ms.

1007
02:08:12,490 --> 02:08:13,351
[SPEAKER_24]: Van der Kloot, you want to?

1008
02:08:14,111 --> 02:08:14,391
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure.

1009
02:08:14,532 --> 02:08:16,573
[SPEAKER_14]: So I just want to mention a couple of things.

1010
02:08:17,054 --> 02:08:37,130
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that at the time, as we consider potential people who would fill, at least in my head, and I guess I have to speak for myself, clearly the assistant superintendent, as it is outlined exactly in that, would have been the person who would have been most likely to step into the role.

1011
02:08:38,331 --> 02:08:39,672
[SPEAKER_14]: However, she's retiring.

1012
02:08:41,132 --> 02:08:41,853
[SPEAKER_14]: The deputy.

1013
02:08:42,353 --> 02:08:43,434
[SPEAKER_14]: The deputy superintendent.

1014
02:08:43,554 --> 02:08:44,255
[SPEAKER_14]: Beverly Nelson.

1015
02:08:44,315 --> 02:08:45,036
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

1016
02:08:45,096 --> 02:08:45,796
[SPEAKER_14]: So she's retiring.

1017
02:08:45,816 --> 02:08:46,837
[SPEAKER_21]: You said the assistant, sorry.

1018
02:08:47,077 --> 02:08:47,358
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry.

1019
02:08:48,839 --> 02:08:49,600
[SPEAKER_14]: She's retiring.

1020
02:08:50,320 --> 02:08:58,087
[SPEAKER_14]: This is not the time to ask her in her career, as she winds down, for her to all of a sudden step into a very difficult role at the last minute.

1021
02:08:59,829 --> 02:09:02,811
[SPEAKER_14]: Another potential would have been Dr. Perella.

1022
02:09:03,672 --> 02:09:07,035
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I don't think it's appropriate to then

1023
02:09:07,531 --> 02:09:13,032
[SPEAKER_14]: ask the guy who you just didn't forward on to the finalists to step into the role.

1024
02:09:15,053 --> 02:09:15,733
[SPEAKER_14]: Things change.

1025
02:09:16,713 --> 02:09:19,734
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think that the superintendent is able.

1026
02:09:20,754 --> 02:09:36,818
[SPEAKER_14]: I believe that if, for example, had he taken ill, which thankfully he did not, but had he been taken ill, that people would have put any personal consideration aside because the loyalty to Mr. Belson is extreme amongst the people he's worked with.

1027
02:09:38,543 --> 02:09:46,888
[SPEAKER_14]: So I don't think, Angela, that we did not think about the succession plan or that we belittled it.

1028
02:09:46,988 --> 02:09:56,112
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we're going to have to look at it again as we do a new administration comes in to make sure that it all makes sense and look at our people, whatever.

1029
02:09:56,572 --> 02:09:59,934
[SPEAKER_14]: But I don't think that was the intent of the school committee just to overlook it.

1030
02:09:59,994 --> 02:10:02,275
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that they were extenuating circumstances.

1031
02:10:04,917 --> 02:10:05,537
[SPEAKER_14]: In my mind,

1032
02:10:06,223 --> 02:10:17,549
[SPEAKER_14]: there was only one thing that was important, and that is, what is in the best interest of the Medford Public Schools right now to ensure an effective transition to the next superintendent?

1033
02:10:19,230 --> 02:10:31,957
[SPEAKER_14]: So, if it, in the, as we now make that transition to a new superintendent, I have no problem at all revisiting that policy, taking a look at it, but essentially, it's going to stand.

1034
02:10:32,537 --> 02:10:33,918
[SPEAKER_14]: But, you know,

1035
02:10:35,548 --> 02:10:46,650
[SPEAKER_14]: For me, the big question of who do we hear, school committee members heard from a lot of people, a lot of people.

1036
02:10:47,350 --> 02:10:58,792
[SPEAKER_14]: And of course, there's been a very vocal segment of the community who's been very out there, who's been very upset with Mr. Belson, and there's been a whole lot of other people who've supported him.

1037
02:11:00,172 --> 02:11:02,793
[SPEAKER_14]: I feel that we are elected

1038
02:11:04,300 --> 02:11:19,568
[SPEAKER_14]: in the most difficult circumstances to keep our eye on the prize and be able to separate ourselves from all the different opinions we hear, no matter how difficult it is, and say, what is the most important thing going forward?

1039
02:11:21,189 --> 02:11:25,291
[SPEAKER_14]: For me, it was to say, how do we make the best transition?

1040
02:11:25,451 --> 02:11:26,392
[SPEAKER_14]: And in my mind,

1041
02:11:27,135 --> 02:11:39,000
[SPEAKER_14]: It was at this point, given the circumstances that presented itself, it was to keep a experienced superintendent who had dedicated his life to Medford to move forward through the next eight weeks.

1042
02:11:41,121 --> 02:11:48,424
[SPEAKER_21]: And I understand where your reasoning comes from, but with all due respect, you've known for months that the deputy was retiring.

1043
02:11:48,444 --> 02:11:56,227
[SPEAKER_21]: You've known for months now that Mr. Belson was going to be retiring early, and there was never a mention, not that any of us have ever heard,

1044
02:11:57,051 --> 02:12:00,773
[SPEAKER_21]: that there was not going to be a person to fill the position.

1045
02:12:01,393 --> 02:12:04,996
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want to add, I do just feel like I need to add in this situation.

1046
02:12:05,136 --> 02:12:12,020
[SPEAKER_03]: I was at the school committee meeting two years ago when Angela came up to the podium and asked very respectfully what the plan was.

1047
02:12:12,200 --> 02:12:13,981
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was embarrassing.

1048
02:12:14,001 --> 02:12:18,963
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think there was only probably one or two other people in the audience, but there were lots of people watching at home.

1049
02:12:19,023 --> 02:12:20,684
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was embarrassing and humiliating.

1050
02:12:20,724 --> 02:12:23,606
[SPEAKER_03]: And I felt terribly for Angela in that experience.

1051
02:12:23,626 --> 02:12:25,127
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember writing an email to

1052
02:12:25,580 --> 02:12:27,061
[SPEAKER_03]: the school committee after that meeting.

1053
02:12:27,421 --> 02:12:30,824
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually befriended Angela as a result of that meeting.

1054
02:12:30,984 --> 02:12:34,687
[SPEAKER_03]: It was entirely unfortunate and it was two years ago.

1055
02:12:34,707 --> 02:12:34,747
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

1056
02:12:36,408 --> 02:12:36,808
[SPEAKER_14]: Van der Kloot.

1057
02:12:37,609 --> 02:12:44,594
[SPEAKER_14]: So I understand that that evening was unfortunate and did not play well.

1058
02:12:45,215 --> 02:12:54,542
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that you meant the question now, you know, in a respectful way and that responded by saying, hey, this is the plan, okay?

1059
02:12:55,193 --> 02:12:58,134
[SPEAKER_14]: There were extenuating circumstances which happened, okay?

1060
02:12:58,174 --> 02:13:04,376
[SPEAKER_14]: There's another person who might have been a potential, but it wasn't a good time for her to take the role.

1061
02:13:08,658 --> 02:13:14,060
[SPEAKER_14]: We need to look at the large picture.

1062
02:13:15,027 --> 02:13:16,547
[SPEAKER_14]: and determine what was the best course.

1063
02:13:17,207 --> 02:13:19,428
[SPEAKER_14]: And I understand there are a lot of people who disagree with us.

1064
02:13:20,328 --> 02:13:31,710
[SPEAKER_14]: The only thing that I can say is that there are five people who are extraordinarily different in many, many ways, and yet five of us agreed that this was the best path.

1065
02:13:32,410 --> 02:13:35,090
[SPEAKER_14]: Two did not, and I respect my colleagues for their decision.

1066
02:13:36,051 --> 02:13:41,532
[SPEAKER_14]: But this is the way it operates in our public discourse of majority rules.

1067
02:13:41,912 --> 02:13:43,872
[SPEAKER_14]: Five of us agreed that this was the best way.

1068
02:13:45,166 --> 02:13:58,977
[SPEAKER_14]: In going forward, absolutely, especially if we have any changes in the way that we operate at central administration, we'll need to come up with a new succession plan in case we have, and hopefully we won't, hopefully we won't in the future.

1069
02:14:00,138 --> 02:14:08,405
[SPEAKER_14]: We wish our new superintendent-elect a long and hopefully blissful reign as being superintendent.

1070
02:14:09,686 --> 02:14:10,247
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Russo.

1071
02:14:12,092 --> 02:14:12,432
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1072
02:14:13,472 --> 02:14:17,573
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm a software developer and have been for 20 years.

1073
02:14:19,194 --> 02:14:33,637
[SPEAKER_11]: And one of the things that I learned probably a couple of years ago, quite surprisingly in an article, was about 80% of what I write for software, if I'm doing my job correctly, is exception handling, is handling the unexpected.

1074
02:14:34,738 --> 02:14:39,619
[SPEAKER_11]: And the reason I bring that up is that as a body, when we write policies,

1075
02:14:41,428 --> 02:14:51,870
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a choice, not sure it's always necessarily a conscious choice, but we have a choice about whether to make the policies robust to handle the unexpected.

1076
02:14:52,971 --> 02:15:06,273
[SPEAKER_11]: And in software, where literally the entire environment is completely controlled by me, 80% of what I'm writing is to deal with the wild, crazy things that are happening.

1077
02:15:07,013 --> 02:15:09,614
[SPEAKER_11]: But in a human endeavor, which is everything we're talking about,

1078
02:15:10,628 --> 02:15:17,691
[SPEAKER_11]: it's probably 99.999% of the possibilities are not within the control of anybody in this room.

1079
02:15:18,571 --> 02:15:37,800
[SPEAKER_11]: And my point is just that when we write a policy, if we try to write policies that are truly robust and can handle endless scenarios, and the people in this room could write for months and never finish coming up with scenarios for how any policy probably won't work.

1080
02:15:39,177 --> 02:15:56,426
[SPEAKER_11]: So we can either focus on a single policy for weeks and months and probably years and still never get it right, or we can rely on the fact that we're going to come together when it doesn't work right and then deal with that, maybe make a tweak to the policy and move forward.

1081
02:15:57,206 --> 02:16:00,168
[SPEAKER_11]: And in my mind, there is just not the bandwidth.

1082
02:16:01,685 --> 02:16:27,377
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't just mean my personal time, but I mean this meeting to get our policies perfect, or even close to perfect, because that's not a reality, even in situations like my job, where I am in control in a way that is not a reality in the human experience.

1083
02:16:27,844 --> 02:16:35,508
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, do I think it's better to have a one or two page policy that has holes you can drive a truck through if the building burns down?

1084
02:16:36,408 --> 02:16:45,153
[SPEAKER_11]: Or if, you know, all the superintendent and deputy and everybody with a superintendent license goes to a conference and, you know, they shut down the airlines.

1085
02:16:45,473 --> 02:16:51,976
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, we could go on and on for how the policy could be better and more robust.

1086
02:16:53,497 --> 02:16:56,879
[SPEAKER_11]: But then the simplest of policies would be a book.

1087
02:16:57,990 --> 02:17:02,893
[SPEAKER_11]: that nobody will read, nobody will know what it says, and you won't be able to use it when you actually need it.

1088
02:17:03,554 --> 02:17:11,499
[SPEAKER_11]: So I want our policies to be as simple as they can be without, too simple.

1089
02:17:12,179 --> 02:17:20,165
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, you know, a succession plan that said if we needed a new superintendent for an unfortunate reason was we'd get a new superintendent.

1090
02:17:20,265 --> 02:17:22,706
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, that's obviously too simple.

1091
02:17:23,087 --> 02:17:24,968
[SPEAKER_11]: But the number of people in our district that have

1092
02:17:25,489 --> 02:17:33,195
[SPEAKER_11]: either a superintendent license, or we could use the MASS to get an emergency superintendent.

1093
02:17:33,636 --> 02:17:34,857
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, that's good enough for me.

1094
02:17:35,097 --> 02:17:46,226
[SPEAKER_21]: One pager's plenty, but we can't cover all the scenarios, and so... I definitely don't want all scenarios covered, but I would like the major scenario of...

1095
02:17:47,520 --> 02:17:52,284
[SPEAKER_21]: If position one cannot be filled, who's going to take control?

1096
02:17:52,784 --> 02:18:04,913
[SPEAKER_21]: Because right now, this is what there is, and then you're saying tonight that, well, it doesn't really matter because it's not in the deputy or even the assistant superintendent's contracts that they would step up.

1097
02:18:05,733 --> 02:18:10,377
[SPEAKER_21]: So this, what is on file as the succession plan, is wrong.

1098
02:18:11,437 --> 02:18:12,818
[SPEAKER_11]: So it can be improved, I agree.

1099
02:18:13,179 --> 02:18:14,039
[SPEAKER_21]: Or just start over.

1100
02:18:16,088 --> 02:18:16,208
[SPEAKER_24]: Ms.

1101
02:18:16,228 --> 02:18:19,690
[SPEAKER_24]: Stone, we have a full agenda as well that we need to get on.

1102
02:18:20,091 --> 02:18:34,379
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to say a parent did email the next day and say, you definitely need to put in the new deputy superintendent's contract that they will step in so that we have to add that because that isn't currently in the contract.

1103
02:18:34,419 --> 02:18:42,624
[SPEAKER_08]: So that doesn't work, which I was a shame on me that I didn't read their contract to know that they did not have to be

1104
02:18:43,974 --> 02:18:47,216
[SPEAKER_08]: are forced into taking that superintendent's job.

1105
02:18:48,557 --> 02:18:54,420
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's, we can add that to make sure the next deputy superintendent is their job.

1106
02:18:55,940 --> 02:18:57,701
[SPEAKER_24]: Final comment, Mr. Benedetto?

1107
02:18:57,721 --> 02:19:02,384
[SPEAKER_22]: To be clear and transparent, thank you.

1108
02:19:03,104 --> 02:19:03,784
[SPEAKER_22]: It's been a long night.

1109
02:19:04,625 --> 02:19:07,206
[SPEAKER_22]: I just want you to know, this didn't come out at that meeting.

1110
02:19:07,626 --> 02:19:07,986
[SPEAKER_21]: No, it didn't.

1111
02:19:08,066 --> 02:19:10,388
[SPEAKER_22]: We didn't pull out this paperwork and read the policy.

1112
02:19:11,758 --> 02:19:18,562
[SPEAKER_22]: Because if we had, we would have went down to the assistant superintendent when the deputy said that she wasn't able to take that position.

1113
02:19:19,903 --> 02:19:24,486
[SPEAKER_22]: I didn't bring it forward because I was floored by what was being proposed to me at the time.

1114
02:19:24,866 --> 02:19:28,068
[SPEAKER_22]: It didn't enter my mind until someone asked me for a copy of this.

1115
02:19:28,489 --> 02:19:31,711
[SPEAKER_22]: And I went, oh my gosh, I can't believe I didn't bring this forward.

1116
02:19:31,971 --> 02:19:35,033
[SPEAKER_22]: And our new members probably have never seen this or read this.

1117
02:19:35,673 --> 02:19:37,675
[SPEAKER_22]: So yeah, you're right.

1118
02:19:38,135 --> 02:19:39,416
[SPEAKER_22]: This should have been implemented.

1119
02:19:39,776 --> 02:19:40,917
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm surprised it wasn't.

1120
02:19:41,988 --> 02:19:49,553
[SPEAKER_22]: I would have loved to seen this implemented because I know Mr. Belson wouldn't have left us hanging and he would still be there for vital information.

1121
02:19:49,613 --> 02:19:50,974
[SPEAKER_22]: And I made that point at that night.

1122
02:19:51,334 --> 02:19:54,576
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'm being transparent about what I did and what I didn't do.

1123
02:19:54,836 --> 02:19:55,877
[SPEAKER_22]: I didn't bring this forward.

1124
02:19:55,977 --> 02:19:57,398
[SPEAKER_22]: I didn't think about this item.

1125
02:19:57,938 --> 02:19:59,219
[SPEAKER_22]: This should have been implemented.

1126
02:19:59,359 --> 02:20:10,066
[SPEAKER_22]: This is our policy that we voted on when you brought it forward, when I left you hanging that night, and I apologize for, because I should have said something that evening as well.

1127
02:20:10,520 --> 02:20:14,261
[SPEAKER_22]: So I own what I've done, and I'm going to try to do better.

1128
02:20:14,841 --> 02:20:17,422
[SPEAKER_22]: So, you know, that's all I can do.

1129
02:20:18,582 --> 02:20:26,484
[SPEAKER_22]: And we need to make sure that, you know, we have people like you reminding us, hey, we did this, because we can't remember everything.

1130
02:20:27,064 --> 02:20:27,465
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1131
02:20:27,565 --> 02:20:30,485
[SPEAKER_03]: And thank you for everyone out there tonight that's still here.

1132
02:20:30,605 --> 02:20:35,807
[SPEAKER_03]: And for folks that are watching at home, we really want to encourage you to remember to come to the school committee meetings.

1133
02:20:36,567 --> 02:20:37,507
[SPEAKER_03]: Let your voice be heard.

1134
02:20:37,547 --> 02:20:39,488
[SPEAKER_03]: Your voice matters, and your vote matters.

1135
02:20:39,568 --> 02:20:39,888
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1136
02:20:40,248 --> 02:20:41,008
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you very much.

1137
02:20:42,909 --> 02:20:47,090
[SPEAKER_24]: Next item up, recommendation to reject school choice for school year 2018-19.

1138
02:20:47,170 --> 02:20:50,991
[SPEAKER_24]: We have a paper.

1139
02:20:51,071 --> 02:20:53,951
[SPEAKER_24]: Traditionally, we have rejected school choice in this community.

1140
02:20:54,231 --> 02:20:56,932
[SPEAKER_24]: Is there a motion on the floor to reject school choice?

1141
02:20:57,392 --> 02:21:00,473
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Russo, seconded by Ms.

1142
02:21:00,493 --> 02:21:01,073
[SPEAKER_24]: Vander Kloof.

1143
02:21:01,453 --> 02:21:02,413
[SPEAKER_24]: Roll call vote, please.

1144
02:21:09,492 --> 02:21:16,677
[SPEAKER_29]: quick summary is that under school choice people can

1145
02:21:17,430 --> 02:21:21,671
[SPEAKER_29]: come to our school district for a very low amount of money if we have open seats.

1146
02:21:22,531 --> 02:21:32,494
[SPEAKER_29]: And the cost that we would receive or the compensation received is not worth it to us, and we would have to educate people that would take seats from other people.

1147
02:21:32,894 --> 02:21:35,034
[SPEAKER_29]: It just doesn't work under the current rule.

1148
02:21:35,355 --> 02:21:40,836
[SPEAKER_29]: If you're a school system that has such open seats and you have no revenue coming in, maybe it makes sense.

1149
02:21:40,876 --> 02:21:41,856
[SPEAKER_29]: That's not our situation.

1150
02:21:43,037 --> 02:21:44,777
[SPEAKER_29]: We have to notify the state by a certain date.

1151
02:21:45,645 --> 02:21:46,605
[SPEAKER_24]: Roll call vote, Ms.

1152
02:21:46,645 --> 02:21:48,446
[SPEAKER_24]: Kreatz, to reject school choice.

1153
02:21:50,327 --> 02:21:50,607
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

1154
02:21:50,627 --> 02:21:53,969
[SPEAKER_22]: I was just waiting for the wording.

1155
02:21:59,051 --> 02:22:01,812
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, motion passes.

1156
02:22:03,893 --> 02:22:08,395
[SPEAKER_24]: Report on middle school, school year 18-19 enrollment and selection.

1157
02:22:11,477 --> 02:22:11,617
[SPEAKER_24]: Ms.

1158
02:22:11,637 --> 02:22:11,997
[SPEAKER_24]: Nelson.

1159
02:22:13,678 --> 02:22:14,118
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening.

1160
02:22:15,547 --> 02:22:21,789
[SPEAKER_06]: From the report, you can see a little bit of the history of what we've been doing over the past several years.

1161
02:22:22,789 --> 02:22:37,053
[SPEAKER_06]: Since the new middle schools opened in 2001, parents of students in grade 5 have been allowed to choose the middle school that they would like their child to attend, starting in 6th grade.

1162
02:22:37,553 --> 02:22:42,134
[SPEAKER_06]: This system worked very well for a number of years, back and forth a little bit, sometimes the McGlynn

1163
02:22:42,696 --> 02:22:51,959
[SPEAKER_06]: had more kids, sometimes the Andrews went back and forth, until this year, when we really had a big difference in enrollment.

1164
02:22:52,559 --> 02:22:59,842
[SPEAKER_06]: And as you know, this past school year, we had several more fifth graders opting to go to the Andrews.

1165
02:23:00,482 --> 02:23:06,444
[SPEAKER_06]: In total, that was 43, which is more than one class, almost two classes of youngsters.

1166
02:23:07,404 --> 02:23:08,865
[SPEAKER_06]: So as we began to

1167
02:23:10,692 --> 02:23:16,856
[SPEAKER_06]: think about moving forward and how we were going to handle the choice situation.

1168
02:23:17,737 --> 02:23:22,200
[SPEAKER_06]: With your approval, we put the following items in place for this year.

1169
02:23:22,220 --> 02:23:23,261
[SPEAKER_06]: We made some changes.

1170
02:23:23,941 --> 02:23:31,246
[SPEAKER_06]: I will say, too, that the numbers of the Andrews of the students in grade six going to grade seven appears to be constant.

1171
02:23:31,266 --> 02:23:35,629
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're still going to have that larger group in moving into grade seven.

1172
02:23:35,649 --> 02:23:38,351
[SPEAKER_06]: There doesn't seem to be any movement out at this point.

1173
02:23:39,805 --> 02:23:49,369
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, this year we decided to do things differently because there had been some things that we felt could be improved upon, one of which was the returning of the choice forms.

1174
02:23:50,430 --> 02:23:53,171
[SPEAKER_06]: Up until this year, parents had options.

1175
02:23:53,291 --> 02:24:00,894
[SPEAKER_06]: They could return them to the school, they could return them to the parent center in person, they could return them to the parent center by mail.

1176
02:24:02,135 --> 02:24:08,037
[SPEAKER_06]: And this led to some confusion because there were deadlines and people felt that they truly had sent it in by the deadline,

1177
02:24:08,505 --> 02:24:09,325
[SPEAKER_06]: but it didn't arrive.

1178
02:24:09,385 --> 02:24:15,548
[SPEAKER_06]: So there were all kinds, whenever you have choice of how you do something, there always leaves room for issues.

1179
02:24:15,948 --> 02:24:18,869
[SPEAKER_06]: So we decided to have a process that was uniform.

1180
02:24:19,189 --> 02:24:25,492
[SPEAKER_06]: And we said this year, all forms would be returned to the school where the child was going to school.

1181
02:24:25,872 --> 02:24:29,894
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's worked very well because we could track all the forms as they came in.

1182
02:24:30,514 --> 02:24:35,936
[SPEAKER_06]: We also wanted parents to have verification that they had actually turned their form in.

1183
02:24:36,406 --> 02:24:42,851
[SPEAKER_06]: So every school, in their own way, gave the parent a number or a form that said that the form was passed.

1184
02:24:42,871 --> 02:24:47,435
[SPEAKER_06]: And so nobody could say, gee, I sent it in, but it must have gone somewhere else.

1185
02:24:47,835 --> 02:24:52,098
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, we felt that process, by tightening up that, that was very helpful.

1186
02:24:53,119 --> 02:25:01,686
[SPEAKER_06]: The second thing that we made changes on is that we decided that the open houses, we'd make them more consistent in the presentation.

1187
02:25:02,226 --> 02:25:03,948
[SPEAKER_06]: And Dr. Riccadeli and I, as you know,

1188
02:25:04,874 --> 02:25:12,499
[SPEAKER_06]: And we basically facilitated the presentation for the McGlynn, which was first, and the Andrews, which was second.

1189
02:25:13,200 --> 02:25:18,523
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, we had the principals there, because we don't want them to be hidden, and we had the tours of the buildings.

1190
02:25:19,063 --> 02:25:33,573
[SPEAKER_06]: But we gave a presentation to really emphasize to parents that the education opportunities at both schools were equal, and that students were going to get an education, the same education, curriculum-wise, in either school.

1191
02:25:34,273 --> 02:25:43,037
[SPEAKER_06]: So we felt that was an improvement, and we asked parents to return forms to the schools, their child's elementary school, by April 2nd.

1192
02:25:43,898 --> 02:25:44,278
[SPEAKER_06]: All right?

1193
02:25:45,378 --> 02:25:50,581
[SPEAKER_06]: And then again, we also put in place that there would be choice.

1194
02:25:50,601 --> 02:25:53,182
[SPEAKER_06]: There was almost like two steps to the process.

1195
02:25:53,202 --> 02:26:03,187
[SPEAKER_06]: There would be choice, but if the choice resulted in imbalance, a large imbalance, the committee voted that they would have a partial lottery, so to even out the numbers.

1196
02:26:03,990 --> 02:26:15,976
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, we were hoping that the choice, the numbers would be even, but as you can see from the data that I gave you at the second sheet, they're not.

1197
02:26:16,016 --> 02:26:28,123
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, in reviewing some of the items with special education today with Joan Bowen, we actually have two more students that need to be placed at the Andrews.

1198
02:26:28,223 --> 02:26:30,284
[SPEAKER_06]: So it brings it to a total of

1199
02:26:30,940 --> 02:26:32,782
[SPEAKER_06]: Entering sixth grade is at the Andrews, 176.

1200
02:26:33,202 --> 02:26:36,645
[SPEAKER_06]: Entering students at the McGlynn is 118.

1201
02:26:38,006 --> 02:26:40,228
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're looking to the committee for next steps.

1202
02:26:41,208 --> 02:26:46,012
[SPEAKER_06]: Parents are waiting to hear definitely what school the children will be attending.

1203
02:26:46,553 --> 02:26:49,575
[SPEAKER_06]: And obviously, principals are eager to start scheduling.

1204
02:26:49,615 --> 02:26:53,418
[SPEAKER_06]: And you really can't start the scheduling process until you have numbers.

1205
02:26:54,019 --> 02:26:59,263
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, moving forward, we, again, need some guidance on

1206
02:26:59,790 --> 02:27:01,270
[SPEAKER_06]: how to conduct this partial lottery.

1207
02:27:01,310 --> 02:27:13,473
[SPEAKER_06]: You can see the different schools where the imbalance is the greatest, and we have to go from there, and I think we probably need to give it some thought, but not too long, because people are eager to move forward.

1208
02:27:16,573 --> 02:27:17,533
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Rousseau, sorry.

1209
02:27:19,474 --> 02:27:20,094
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Ms.

1210
02:27:20,114 --> 02:27:22,294
[SPEAKER_11]: Nelson.

1211
02:27:22,794 --> 02:27:25,295
[SPEAKER_11]: Some parents did not submit a form back.

1212
02:27:26,375 --> 02:27:26,835
[SPEAKER_11]: Very few.

1213
02:27:27,785 --> 02:27:36,031
[SPEAKER_11]: Were there efforts to contact those families to find out what their preferences were?

1214
02:27:37,132 --> 02:27:43,077
[SPEAKER_06]: There were very few that didn't return them, and I'm not quite sure what individual principals did.

1215
02:27:43,157 --> 02:27:46,139
[SPEAKER_06]: I can find out, again, at their age, from school to school.

1216
02:27:46,720 --> 02:27:54,185
[SPEAKER_06]: But again, what we did is we found that, again, as you can see, that there were some that had no requests.

1217
02:27:56,574 --> 02:28:03,096
[SPEAKER_06]: basically the programs like the EL students did not have choice because they do have to go to the McGlynn, so there were things like that.

1218
02:28:03,496 --> 02:28:12,839
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, with Joan Bowen today, we were able to make sure we had the students who needed to be placed in certain special education programs in the appropriate building.

1219
02:28:16,395 --> 02:28:19,257
[SPEAKER_11]: spent entirely too many hours on these numbers this weekend.

1220
02:28:20,738 --> 02:28:23,721
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for getting this to us as early as possible.

1221
02:28:24,662 --> 02:28:34,109
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, reviewing this was not really very fun, because the imbalance was so pronounced.

1222
02:28:34,769 --> 02:28:45,097
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just, you know, when I was trying to figure out how we would handle this, other than the fact that we would have to have a partial lottery, you know, I was trying to figure out, like, what are the principles that I feel are important,

1223
02:28:46,363 --> 02:28:53,365
[SPEAKER_11]: The basic principle that I felt was the only one that I could stand on was that each school sends half their kids to each middle school.

1224
02:28:54,305 --> 02:29:13,929
[SPEAKER_11]: And because the selection between the schools from the individual elementary schools is very pronounced in a couple of the schools, that means that a couple of the elementary schools will have a much greater amount of getting their non-preferred school.

1225
02:29:14,450 --> 02:29:15,790
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just want to make sure that

1226
02:29:18,431 --> 02:29:24,617
[SPEAKER_11]: So I've never had any doubt that this process is perfectly fair and there's no shenanigans going on.

1227
02:29:25,078 --> 02:29:39,973
[SPEAKER_11]: But for this year in particular, I really think it's important that when the randomization is happening, that there is at least one school committee member present, that the public is free to show up if they want.

1228
02:29:40,533 --> 02:29:46,035
[SPEAKER_11]: and that this randomization is done live with people present, whether it's recorded or not.

1229
02:29:46,495 --> 02:29:57,020
[SPEAKER_11]: Because it's randomized, they go, you're the brother of that person, that's why you got to go to Andrews or whatever school.

1230
02:29:57,620 --> 02:30:01,542
[SPEAKER_11]: And those things are gonna happen, but not because of that.

1231
02:30:02,022 --> 02:30:09,845
[SPEAKER_11]: And I've never felt that I had concerns that this stuff wasn't being done honestly, but I just feel like

1232
02:30:10,494 --> 02:30:16,437
[SPEAKER_11]: there's no reason we can't shut that down by saying, look, here's the video, you can show it if you want.

1233
02:30:19,219 --> 02:30:30,706
[SPEAKER_11]: I realize there's some planning involved in that, but I just think it's worth it, because there's gonna be a lot of unhappy parents, at least, maybe students too.

1234
02:30:31,493 --> 02:30:31,913
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree.

1235
02:30:31,993 --> 02:30:32,794
[SPEAKER_06]: This is not easy.

1236
02:30:33,354 --> 02:30:36,875
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, people have had choice and I think we had our fingers crossed.

1237
02:30:37,355 --> 02:30:42,657
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we made it clear to parents, we didn't want to say you have choice and then turn around and do something very different.

1238
02:30:42,677 --> 02:30:50,200
[SPEAKER_06]: We made it clear in the letter that went to them that, you know what, we're going to try the choice method, but if it doesn't work, we're going to have to go to something else.

1239
02:30:50,220 --> 02:30:51,441
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think we've warned parents.

1240
02:30:51,841 --> 02:30:57,403
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're not, I would not advise doing something, a third option, but certainly people,

1241
02:30:58,372 --> 02:31:08,696
[SPEAKER_06]: If we had to go to the lottery, people want it to be fair, and I think what you're saying in terms of people seeing that it's a fair process would be the way to go.

1242
02:31:08,796 --> 02:31:18,520
[SPEAKER_06]: But this is the committee's decision, and like I said, I mean, you might want to give it some thought, but people are kind of calling up and saying, what am I going to know?

1243
02:31:18,741 --> 02:31:21,542
[SPEAKER_06]: And the principals, too, need to begin to schedule buildings.

1244
02:31:22,162 --> 02:31:22,322
[SPEAKER_24]: Ms.

1245
02:31:22,342 --> 02:31:22,782
[SPEAKER_24]: Van der Kloot.

1246
02:31:23,703 --> 02:31:25,603
[SPEAKER_14]: So I just have a couple of thoughts on this.

1247
02:31:28,084 --> 02:31:43,147
[SPEAKER_14]: If, I'm reflecting back on the presentation by our superintendent elect and what Dr. Eduard Vincent suggested was that we first appeal to people.

1248
02:31:43,708 --> 02:31:54,190
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, I don't think we can appeal to people and ask them if they might consider moving their child to the McGlynn unless we have.

1249
02:31:58,662 --> 02:32:05,169
[SPEAKER_14]: And so I would want to see us move on, I understand there might be some negotiations involved.

1250
02:32:05,209 --> 02:32:11,357
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know whether the person who's there is ready to want that position.

1251
02:32:13,235 --> 02:32:26,683
[SPEAKER_14]: Obviously, he's been met with a lot of favoritism, and I think that if it was clear who the principal was, when we did this, it was, oh, there's no principal, while the other schools had a principal.

1252
02:32:26,943 --> 02:32:32,006
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I wouldn't have selected my school if, well, here there's no principal.

1253
02:32:33,027 --> 02:32:34,728
[SPEAKER_14]: So the first thing we have to do,

1254
02:32:35,257 --> 02:32:37,278
[SPEAKER_14]: is move on that appointment.

1255
02:32:37,338 --> 02:32:38,418
[SPEAKER_14]: That would be my number one.

1256
02:32:38,979 --> 02:32:51,204
[SPEAKER_14]: The second is, the most obvious is that we have a group of students, there's 21 students at the McGlynn, and many of their peers already traditionally stay at the McGlynn.

1257
02:32:51,744 --> 02:32:53,045
[SPEAKER_14]: Now maybe not all 21 would go.

1258
02:32:54,278 --> 02:33:05,606
[SPEAKER_14]: but certainly if there's, because of the proximity, that principal who we put into place might be able to make a bond with the kids and family.

1259
02:33:05,706 --> 02:33:16,414
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you know, I'm just wondering whether it isn't worth putting a little bit of effort into saying it's not going to be quite equal, there'll be some imbalance that we're going to live with this year.

1260
02:33:18,436 --> 02:33:19,917
[SPEAKER_14]: But over time,

1261
02:33:20,577 --> 02:33:22,858
[SPEAKER_14]: And Mr. Martelloni did this very well.

1262
02:33:23,178 --> 02:33:27,400
[SPEAKER_14]: He showed us in his graphs how it had changed.

1263
02:33:27,840 --> 02:33:31,782
[SPEAKER_14]: We put a strong principle into the McGlynn, we're going to see a change.

1264
02:33:33,042 --> 02:33:43,746
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think that, and down the road, we might want to do something completely different like Dr. Maurice floated to us as an idea out of the box.

1265
02:33:44,146 --> 02:33:47,968
[SPEAKER_14]: But I definitely think that we should at least send out letters

1266
02:33:49,037 --> 02:33:50,897
[SPEAKER_14]: To parents we need to put a principal in place.

1267
02:33:51,458 --> 02:33:59,979
[SPEAKER_14]: We need to have and we need to at least target Maybe the McGlynn elementary students saying would you be willing now again?

1268
02:34:00,019 --> 02:34:10,341
[SPEAKER_14]: There may be some parents who aren't for particular reasons that their kid needs to change But then maybe on the other hand someone's gonna be here who the principal is and the rest of the group and they're gonna say Hey, I kind of like him for my kid.

1269
02:34:10,381 --> 02:34:13,762
[SPEAKER_14]: He would be a good match So that would be my first thought

1270
02:34:15,927 --> 02:34:17,888
[SPEAKER_29]: So let me add a couple of other dimensions to this thing.

1271
02:34:17,928 --> 02:34:26,832
[SPEAKER_29]: If we take the next two weeks, remember the principal, who we are all talking about a little bit, needs to think about it in terms of his own personal needs.

1272
02:34:26,892 --> 02:34:31,714
[SPEAKER_29]: I mean, he's obviously a person who has to weigh all his situations.

1273
02:34:31,774 --> 02:34:32,915
[SPEAKER_29]: But we've had discussions.

1274
02:34:32,995 --> 02:34:36,576
[SPEAKER_29]: And I think over the next several days, we'll get an answer.

1275
02:34:36,696 --> 02:34:37,077
[SPEAKER_29]: That's one.

1276
02:34:38,417 --> 02:34:44,600
[SPEAKER_29]: Second piece is that we haven't done the numbers, but I have, is that the class size is at the McGlynn right now.

1277
02:34:45,873 --> 02:34:51,976
[SPEAKER_29]: If you were to go to class size, you're probably like 14, 15 in the class size, whereas at the Andrews, it's closer to 20.

1278
02:34:53,116 --> 02:35:00,899
[SPEAKER_29]: So maybe smaller class size is another attractive feature that's there for some people, not everybody.

1279
02:35:01,940 --> 02:35:13,204
[SPEAKER_29]: And thirdly, you know, if people would like to consider staying there with their friends and they go in a cohort, as Paul mentioned, you know, and if their friends go with them, because we've heard that before, that might do it.

1280
02:35:13,745 --> 02:35:14,445
[SPEAKER_29]: So a suggestion.

1281
02:35:15,547 --> 02:35:17,908
[SPEAKER_29]: Over the next two weeks, we do what we have to do.

1282
02:35:18,768 --> 02:35:19,948
[SPEAKER_29]: We talk to people.

1283
02:35:20,788 --> 02:35:22,929
[SPEAKER_29]: We go over the principalship.

1284
02:35:23,509 --> 02:35:24,569
[SPEAKER_29]: We make a serious effort.

1285
02:35:25,189 --> 02:35:28,670
[SPEAKER_29]: But at the end of two weeks, when we come back on the 21st, you've got to act.

1286
02:35:29,210 --> 02:35:31,711
[SPEAKER_29]: You've got to act, because we've got to get in the business of doing business.

1287
02:35:31,751 --> 02:35:33,311
[SPEAKER_29]: There's things to be done.

1288
02:35:33,951 --> 02:35:36,012
[SPEAKER_29]: And sometimes hard decisions have to be made.

1289
02:35:36,432 --> 02:35:39,573
[SPEAKER_29]: Now, we don't need a one for one at the schools.

1290
02:35:39,613 --> 02:35:40,873
[SPEAKER_29]: They don't have to be exactly even.

1291
02:35:42,093 --> 02:35:43,114
[SPEAKER_29]: But they have to be close enough.

1292
02:35:45,128 --> 02:35:45,688
[SPEAKER_29]: within 15, 20 kids.

1293
02:35:45,748 --> 02:35:49,190
[SPEAKER_29]: I mean, that's a reasonable differential.

1294
02:35:50,411 --> 02:35:50,511
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay?

1295
02:35:51,491 --> 02:35:51,751
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1296
02:35:52,812 --> 02:35:53,492
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Ruggiero.

1297
02:35:53,973 --> 02:35:55,073
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just want to make this clear.

1298
02:35:55,093 --> 02:35:56,674
[SPEAKER_10]: Right now, we have a disparity of 29 children.

1299
02:35:56,714 --> 02:35:57,414
[SPEAKER_10]: So if 29 of the 100- 58.

1300
02:35:57,454 --> 02:35:59,816
[SPEAKER_10]: No, 29 of the 176 went to the McGlynn, it would be equal.

1301
02:35:59,876 --> 02:36:00,236
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that correct?

1302
02:36:00,256 --> 02:36:00,676
[SPEAKER_10]: That's my math.

1303
02:36:00,696 --> 02:36:00,916
[SPEAKER_10]: If we were

1304
02:36:09,335 --> 02:36:12,056
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we subtract 29, add 29, it works out, okay.

1305
02:36:12,076 --> 02:36:13,016
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I believe you.

1306
02:36:13,156 --> 02:36:16,798
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm just trying to, once again, trying to get the 15 to 20.

1307
02:36:17,838 --> 02:36:21,839
[SPEAKER_10]: So if we're in a buffer of 15, that would work.

1308
02:36:22,560 --> 02:36:23,800
[SPEAKER_10]: So one school has... Right.

1309
02:36:24,160 --> 02:36:36,425
[SPEAKER_06]: We've also asked Mrs. Guarino to identify the students, the 21 students who opted to go to the Andrews, and perhaps they may reconsider, again, to go back to the McGlynn, and that would be 21.

1310
02:36:37,663 --> 02:36:39,084
[SPEAKER_06]: additional that would move back into the McGlynn.

1311
02:36:39,124 --> 02:36:41,666
[SPEAKER_10]: So we need to convince 14 students, basically.

1312
02:36:43,387 --> 02:36:53,214
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep, 14 on the, that would be the most, if we can convince 14 students, are there any incentives that we can offer other than low class size that we can offer to those 14 students?

1313
02:36:53,855 --> 02:36:56,617
[SPEAKER_10]: Like is it possible we could identify the cohorts?

1314
02:36:56,977 --> 02:37:04,703
[SPEAKER_10]: So these are 10 kids that just definitely wanna be together, they're buddies, and so we're gonna make sure that they go over and we can get to our 14.

1315
02:37:06,747 --> 02:37:08,868
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we have a meeting with principals tomorrow.

1316
02:37:08,908 --> 02:37:11,728
[SPEAKER_06]: I know the elementary principals come in with Diane at 930.

1317
02:37:11,788 --> 02:37:16,869
[SPEAKER_06]: We can maybe put something out to them and encourage them maybe to go back.

1318
02:37:17,070 --> 02:37:21,551
[SPEAKER_06]: I do think that the leadership of the school would make a difference.

1319
02:37:21,951 --> 02:37:26,472
[SPEAKER_06]: We have talked to Mr. Tucci, but I have to give him time to make his decisions.

1320
02:37:26,492 --> 02:37:27,612
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a big decision for him.

1321
02:37:28,172 --> 02:37:31,313
[SPEAKER_06]: I think if he were to be appointed that we'd see

1322
02:37:32,667 --> 02:37:34,088
[SPEAKER_06]: an influx of people back in.

1323
02:37:34,589 --> 02:37:36,910
[SPEAKER_06]: But we have to kind of wait that out a little bit.

1324
02:37:38,051 --> 02:37:39,051
[SPEAKER_29]: So one more thing.

1325
02:37:40,072 --> 02:37:42,293
[SPEAKER_29]: Tonight you saw some teachers come in from Lumbergoyne.

1326
02:37:43,834 --> 02:37:47,316
[SPEAKER_29]: As we said before, and as I think we all agree, there's some terrific people there.

1327
02:37:48,037 --> 02:37:56,562
[SPEAKER_29]: It may be that we send a few emissaries over from Glen Middle to talk to some of the elementary school kids, and maybe they can talk about their programs a little bit.

1328
02:37:56,602 --> 02:37:59,264
[SPEAKER_29]: Talk about some of the things they'd like to do, and maybe that's a piece too.

1329
02:38:00,422 --> 02:38:02,442
[SPEAKER_29]: So there's four or five things we can do.

1330
02:38:03,643 --> 02:38:06,843
[SPEAKER_29]: It's not a guarantee, but it's worth a shot.

1331
02:38:08,184 --> 02:38:12,865
[SPEAKER_29]: You just have to be prepared that some people will say no and some people will say yes.

1332
02:38:13,805 --> 02:38:19,246
[SPEAKER_29]: Another issue that we've got to deal with is not specifically this one, but it's an issue, and that's the seventh grade.

1333
02:38:20,526 --> 02:38:29,548
[SPEAKER_29]: You have emailed me and other people have emailed me ad nauseam, no offense, about a person here and a person there.

1334
02:38:30,477 --> 02:38:33,820
[SPEAKER_29]: There are 12 people who wanted that shift.

1335
02:38:34,420 --> 02:38:40,865
[SPEAKER_29]: If we do it for one, you know, out of turn, it's going to send some other people unhappy.

1336
02:38:40,945 --> 02:38:41,906
[SPEAKER_29]: So we've got to look at that.

1337
02:38:41,946 --> 02:38:45,208
[SPEAKER_29]: Let's see what the numbers actually present in the seventh grade.

1338
02:38:45,728 --> 02:38:47,890
[SPEAKER_29]: We'll get a better sense of what the seventh grade is like.

1339
02:38:47,950 --> 02:38:50,992
[SPEAKER_29]: Maybe with the new principal, that would be a positive too.

1340
02:38:51,633 --> 02:38:57,577
[SPEAKER_29]: But before we start taking any one person out of line, I think that's something else we need to be careful about.

1341
02:39:03,887 --> 02:39:08,388
[SPEAKER_10]: My question, so I just want to know when is the deadline we have to decide exactly on the lottery?

1342
02:39:09,289 --> 02:39:12,469
[SPEAKER_29]: I would say the 21st we should be ready to make a decision.

1343
02:39:13,189 --> 02:39:15,870
[SPEAKER_29]: We should, you know, give you an idea towards the end of that week.

1344
02:39:16,250 --> 02:39:16,410
[SPEAKER_29]: Okay.

1345
02:39:16,770 --> 02:39:19,251
[SPEAKER_29]: You know, that it's either happening or it's not happening.

1346
02:39:20,971 --> 02:39:21,611
[SPEAKER_29]: Mr. Russo.

1347
02:39:22,991 --> 02:39:24,692
[SPEAKER_11]: I would just like to speak to the issue of the 21.

1348
02:39:26,088 --> 02:39:34,673
[SPEAKER_11]: McGlynn Elementary students that have selected the Andrews, I am actually quite uncomfortable with them even being contacted to see if they would switch.

1349
02:39:35,333 --> 02:39:42,217
[SPEAKER_11]: The goal of 50% of the kids from each school is an incredibly important one we should be working towards.

1350
02:39:42,517 --> 02:39:54,243
[SPEAKER_11]: And we should be thankful for the 66 kids that selected the McGlynn for reducing the pressure that we're currently experiencing because if the McGlynn had done a selection very similar to the other schools,

1351
02:39:54,656 --> 02:39:56,637
[SPEAKER_11]: this whole mess would be a much bigger mess.

1352
02:39:57,778 --> 02:40:07,803
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm not really thrilled that there's a greater number of students from the McGlynn that are going to stay in the McGlynn, but I sort of thank them anyways.

1353
02:40:09,104 --> 02:40:23,151
[SPEAKER_11]: But the 21 kids from the McGlynn that have selected the Andrews, to me, are not the families that should be at all looked at for finding more seats.

1354
02:40:25,165 --> 02:40:36,111
[SPEAKER_11]: And at the Columbus, as Mr. Belson alluded to, I know some families at the Columbus who got together, talked to each other, and decided, look, we want to be together.

1355
02:40:37,712 --> 02:40:41,274
[SPEAKER_11]: And if we all select the Andrews, who knows?

1356
02:40:42,194 --> 02:40:45,996
[SPEAKER_11]: And they decided after going to the open houses, look, these schools are both great.

1357
02:40:46,657 --> 02:40:51,219
[SPEAKER_11]: And they decided to take the safe bet based on what was going on at the time.

1358
02:40:51,724 --> 02:40:55,667
[SPEAKER_11]: and they selected, as a group, to choose the McGlynn.

1359
02:40:55,927 --> 02:40:59,390
[SPEAKER_11]: And they all got the McGlynn, of course, and they're super happy.

1360
02:40:59,770 --> 02:41:20,265
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would just recommend to the families that have selected the Andrews, that the Roberts, Columbus, and the Brooks, that if you have even thought about this, talk to your friends, your kids' friends, which is, you know, and start this conversation right away.

1361
02:41:20,890 --> 02:41:24,992
[SPEAKER_11]: and then raise your hand right away so we can get this stuff going earlier.

1362
02:41:25,472 --> 02:41:30,534
[SPEAKER_11]: Because if we can get the numbers down low enough where we don't even need a lottery, that would be great.

1363
02:41:30,574 --> 02:41:39,858
[SPEAKER_11]: But also, wouldn't it be nice if you have a child with four friends who have never been separated since preschool, and you want them to go together to one school.

1364
02:41:40,278 --> 02:41:48,922
[SPEAKER_11]: If you don't decide to go to the McGlynn together, and you go into the lottery, one of your children, maybe yours, is going to be going to the McGlynn

1365
02:41:49,372 --> 02:41:51,212
[SPEAKER_11]: And the other three are staying at the Andrews.

1366
02:41:51,632 --> 02:41:52,893
[SPEAKER_11]: And yeah, that is awful.

1367
02:41:53,733 --> 02:41:57,534
[SPEAKER_11]: But that's not really one of our choices to not do that.

1368
02:41:57,794 --> 02:42:00,074
[SPEAKER_11]: So families need to think about that.

1369
02:42:00,634 --> 02:42:02,375
[SPEAKER_11]: Really think about that.

1370
02:42:03,135 --> 02:42:03,295
[SPEAKER_24]: Ms.

1371
02:42:03,355 --> 02:42:05,615
[SPEAKER_24]: Nelson, do we know if any PTO meetings are coming up?

1372
02:42:07,836 --> 02:42:08,396
[SPEAKER_24]: The elementaries?

1373
02:42:09,556 --> 02:42:10,156
[SPEAKER_07]: We had one tonight.

1374
02:42:10,516 --> 02:42:10,976
[SPEAKER_06]: It's tonight.

1375
02:42:12,096 --> 02:42:12,556
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's right.

1376
02:42:12,636 --> 02:42:15,237
[SPEAKER_06]: But again, we do have the principals in tomorrow morning.

1377
02:42:16,120 --> 02:42:23,407
[SPEAKER_06]: We will bring it up with them and maybe we can get a little more, but it's like not huge numbers.

1378
02:42:23,427 --> 02:42:29,473
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't have to move 50 kids, 60 kids, but just enough to make it a little bit more equitable.

1379
02:42:30,353 --> 02:42:30,514
[SPEAKER_08]: Ms.

1380
02:42:30,554 --> 02:42:30,954
[SPEAKER_08]: Mustone.

1381
02:42:31,795 --> 02:42:37,240
[SPEAKER_08]: Back in January when our meeting was in the media studio in the McGlynn

1382
02:42:38,130 --> 02:42:41,051
[SPEAKER_08]: teachers spoke about their improvement plan.

1383
02:42:41,831 --> 02:42:50,414
[SPEAKER_08]: Someone mentioned almost, I don't want to call it gifted and talented because that's not what they called it, but it was, does this sound familiar to you?

1384
02:42:51,255 --> 02:42:54,376
[SPEAKER_08]: And they were saying that could be a way to attract that.

1385
02:42:54,456 --> 02:43:03,499
[SPEAKER_08]: If you spoke to the four elementary school principals and said maybe you could, kids who want to be pushed more or kids whose parents want to push them more, maybe

1386
02:43:03,983 --> 02:43:06,344
[SPEAKER_08]: it was talked about having a program at the McGlynn.

1387
02:43:06,684 --> 02:43:08,185
[SPEAKER_08]: Does that sound familiar to anyone else?

1388
02:43:08,765 --> 02:43:11,147
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, and we did put clubs in place.

1389
02:43:11,387 --> 02:43:12,387
[SPEAKER_08]: No, this wasn't a club.

1390
02:43:12,427 --> 02:43:16,289
[SPEAKER_08]: This was a curriculum.

1391
02:43:16,349 --> 02:43:19,851
[SPEAKER_08]: They would be tracked, more or less.

1392
02:43:23,753 --> 02:43:25,294
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Benedetto, are you finished?

1393
02:43:25,394 --> 02:43:28,375
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I'm just trying to help clarify.

1394
02:43:29,156 --> 02:43:33,278
[SPEAKER_22]: I believe it was a company that was coming in and offering a specific program.

1395
02:43:33,963 --> 02:43:36,164
[SPEAKER_24]: And that is there.

1396
02:43:36,224 --> 02:43:36,744
[SPEAKER_22]: That is there.

1397
02:43:36,804 --> 02:43:40,645
[SPEAKER_24]: That is at the McGlynn, Mighty, I call it Mighty, Midday.

1398
02:43:40,665 --> 02:43:41,166
[SPEAKER_22]: That's there.

1399
02:43:41,986 --> 02:43:42,306
[SPEAKER_24]: Meety.

1400
02:43:45,787 --> 02:43:46,587
[SPEAKER_22]: Odyssey of the Mind.

1401
02:43:51,949 --> 02:43:58,912
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Miss Lou did do a club that was a club, but not a separate, but again, the idea was there.

1402
02:44:00,052 --> 02:44:02,573
[SPEAKER_06]: Gifted and talented, full program now.

1403
02:44:03,410 --> 02:44:11,975
[SPEAKER_06]: requires a person who has not licensure but endorsement to do it, so it's somebody specialized that would have to get that endorsement through DESE.

1404
02:44:12,716 --> 02:44:14,256
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think, I'm pretty sure Ms.

1405
02:44:14,317 --> 02:44:19,560
[SPEAKER_06]: Liu did generate something related to the Odyssey of the Mind this past year, and we did.

1406
02:44:19,580 --> 02:44:30,126
[SPEAKER_06]: We really thought that a lot of the things that we put in place, like the clubs that everyone had access to, would improve some of this, but I really,

1407
02:44:30,967 --> 02:44:38,413
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it boils down to the unknown leadership, and I think if that is solidified, we may have something happening.

1408
02:44:52,849 --> 02:44:57,953
[SPEAKER_23]: It's interesting to see this kind of come full circle with me at the end of my school year.

1409
02:44:58,613 --> 02:45:03,337
[SPEAKER_23]: And yeah, I think it does boil down to unknown leadership.

1410
02:45:03,857 --> 02:45:08,741
[SPEAKER_23]: I think that's a huge part of it, and the incidents that have happened at the school this year.

1411
02:45:10,462 --> 02:45:15,746
[SPEAKER_23]: And I know earlier in the year, we talked about launching a PR campaign, and not necessarily

1412
02:45:16,901 --> 02:45:24,663
[SPEAKER_23]: diminishing the role of the Andrews, because they've done some amazing work as well, but highlighting the achievements of the McGlynn.

1413
02:45:25,703 --> 02:45:30,904
[SPEAKER_23]: So I think that's super important, and that we should try to use that to attract people back.

1414
02:45:32,165 --> 02:45:35,165
[SPEAKER_23]: But we also have to keep in mind the concept of equity.

1415
02:45:35,745 --> 02:45:46,248
[SPEAKER_23]: And we have to make sure that the student populations at both schools are reflective of the community as a whole, and not disproportionate towards ELL populations.

1416
02:45:47,168 --> 02:45:51,591
[SPEAKER_23]: that's a separate program, but towards certain populations and certain income groups.

1417
02:45:52,231 --> 02:46:06,200
[SPEAKER_23]: And I think, you know, Mr. Russo raised a really interesting idea of doing half and half of different schools and, you know, we need time to explore that option, but that does ensure in a more fair way that we have

1418
02:46:07,336 --> 02:46:14,101
[SPEAKER_23]: a fair representation of different income groups and different racial groups and social groups there at both schools.

1419
02:46:14,742 --> 02:46:21,027
[SPEAKER_23]: So we have to keep in mind that equity is super important in making sure the reputation of our school.

1420
02:46:21,347 --> 02:46:27,171
[SPEAKER_23]: If you have more challenged population in one school, that's going to be reflected in your test scores.

1421
02:46:27,231 --> 02:46:32,315
[SPEAKER_23]: And parents are going to look at that and choose one school over the other.

1422
02:46:32,355 --> 02:46:35,518
[SPEAKER_23]: So we need to make sure that looks fair.

1423
02:46:36,375 --> 02:46:40,277
[SPEAKER_23]: And another good idea is we talked about cohorts.

1424
02:46:40,578 --> 02:46:41,078
[SPEAKER_23]: And I know Ms.

1425
02:46:41,558 --> 02:46:50,103
[SPEAKER_23]: Van der Gloot at the beginning of the year talked about how a lot of parents are choosing the injuries because their friends or the friends of their kids are going there.

1426
02:46:50,603 --> 02:46:52,424
[SPEAKER_23]: And that's the reality.

1427
02:46:52,725 --> 02:46:55,406
[SPEAKER_23]: I mean, they are going there because of their cohorts.

1428
02:46:57,145 --> 02:47:03,789
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm just throwing this out there, and I'm not saying this is a perfect solution by far, but I know Harvard does blocking groups.

1429
02:47:03,949 --> 02:47:11,853
[SPEAKER_23]: They have cohorts sign up together and request a certain dorm together and certain houses together.

1430
02:47:12,053 --> 02:47:19,057
[SPEAKER_23]: And I think maybe exploring something along those lines, making sure that we have equity in our lines.

1431
02:47:20,157 --> 02:47:26,601
[SPEAKER_23]: And I'm not saying it's perfect by any means, but looking at the importance of cohorts in distributing your students.

1432
02:47:28,789 --> 02:47:29,230
[SPEAKER_24]: Very good.

1433
02:47:29,390 --> 02:47:30,070
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Justin.

1434
02:47:31,231 --> 02:47:31,371
[SPEAKER_24]: Ms.

1435
02:47:31,531 --> 02:47:32,211
[SPEAKER_24]: Mustone.

1436
02:47:32,251 --> 02:47:35,032
[SPEAKER_08]: More suggestion or just to think about.

1437
02:47:35,453 --> 02:47:42,156
[SPEAKER_08]: So if we did move half the ELL students to the Andrews, the numbers would be equal.

1438
02:47:43,937 --> 02:47:48,639
[SPEAKER_06]: The numbers would be equal, but you'd have an issue with staffing.

1439
02:47:48,939 --> 02:47:51,300
[SPEAKER_06]: This is why we consolidated to one school.

1440
02:47:51,560 --> 02:47:53,601
[SPEAKER_06]: There are 36 ELL students.

1441
02:47:54,162 --> 02:47:57,043
[SPEAKER_06]: There are different levels of language proficiency.

1442
02:47:57,531 --> 02:48:01,274
[SPEAKER_06]: you have your newcomers program and they again have to be housed together.

1443
02:48:02,575 --> 02:48:16,385
[SPEAKER_06]: Where the McGlynn right now has more space, the new model for the EL, which is something that Mr. Tixera had to do because of CPR, is that we're moving those kids into the regular classes.

1444
02:48:17,025 --> 02:48:20,888
[SPEAKER_06]: And right now, because of the low class size, there's more room to do that at the McGlynn.

1445
02:48:21,288 --> 02:48:24,971
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's all kinds of logistical things, but mostly it's staffing because you'd have to have

1446
02:48:26,234 --> 02:48:29,376
[SPEAKER_06]: more ELL teachers to be over at the other school.

1447
02:48:29,496 --> 02:48:33,819
[SPEAKER_08]: With the Roberts, we had the program grades one through five.

1448
02:48:33,839 --> 02:48:34,659
[SPEAKER_08]: You had the newcomers.

1449
02:48:35,019 --> 02:48:38,401
[SPEAKER_08]: For a few years, we were maxed on physical space.

1450
02:48:39,042 --> 02:48:41,063
[SPEAKER_08]: This year, grades one and two went to the Brooks.

1451
02:48:41,443 --> 02:48:43,224
[SPEAKER_08]: Roberts retained three, four, and five.

1452
02:48:44,945 --> 02:48:52,669
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't heard much feedback one way or the other, but it freed up physical space in our building at the Roberts.

1453
02:48:54,750 --> 02:49:03,972
[SPEAKER_08]: just thinking of the 50 families, well, or 29, who end up not getting what they desired in our school choice.

1454
02:49:04,432 --> 02:49:22,537
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you, the Andrews used to have an ELL program, and we have the staffing for it, maybe that's a way to, and Justin, I guess Justin is what made me think of it, is that you don't want the McGlynn to be almost stigmatized, and if the Andrews has it as well, then we're helping there too.

1455
02:49:23,738 --> 02:49:27,439
[SPEAKER_09]: So if I could address the transition of grades one and two over to the Brooks.

1456
02:49:27,959 --> 02:49:29,299
[SPEAKER_09]: That has been very successful.

1457
02:49:29,419 --> 02:49:29,739
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, good.

1458
02:49:30,019 --> 02:49:31,519
[SPEAKER_09]: The Brooks is doing well.

1459
02:49:31,559 --> 02:49:32,940
[SPEAKER_09]: They love the kiddos over there.

1460
02:49:33,340 --> 02:49:36,300
[SPEAKER_09]: And the Roberts has now a little more space to work with, which is great.

1461
02:49:37,481 --> 02:49:39,881
[SPEAKER_09]: The issue is that's a clean mix.

1462
02:49:39,921 --> 02:49:42,362
[SPEAKER_09]: So you take two teachers and move two teachers.

1463
02:49:42,942 --> 02:49:47,302
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think it's as clean when they go to middle school because they're a different content area.

1464
02:49:47,342 --> 02:49:50,043
[SPEAKER_09]: So there may be more staffing that they need.

1465
02:49:50,586 --> 02:49:52,968
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, but we're going to get our hands dirty one way or the other.

1466
02:49:53,208 --> 02:49:59,012
[SPEAKER_08]: Either we're going to have 29 really angry families, or we're going to be dirty our hands with staffing with ELL.

1467
02:49:59,212 --> 02:50:05,217
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think one of the good points that Beverly mentioned is that the class size is so small at the McGlynn right now.

1468
02:50:05,757 --> 02:50:12,162
[SPEAKER_09]: With an average class size of 14 and putting more kids in it, that's a great attraction for some families.

1469
02:50:13,383 --> 02:50:18,887
[SPEAKER_09]: But I love Mr. Russo's idea of friends, because that's a huge draw, I think.

1470
02:50:19,487 --> 02:50:28,151
[SPEAKER_09]: So if we were able to get to our families and say to our families, do you want to take the chance of the lottery, or do you want your four friends maybe to go together?

1471
02:50:28,191 --> 02:50:29,452
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's a great idea.

1472
02:50:29,512 --> 02:50:31,633
[SPEAKER_05]: So we might be able to bring that up tomorrow.

1473
02:50:31,693 --> 02:50:32,253
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.

1474
02:50:32,293 --> 02:50:39,116
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think if people knew that the lottery is a reality, because I don't think people believed us, that we would go to step two.

1475
02:50:39,676 --> 02:50:47,420
[SPEAKER_06]: But if we put that out tomorrow, that it is indeed the way we're going to go, unless we have people who volunteer to move groups of kids.

1476
02:50:47,884 --> 02:50:52,267
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll work on that tomorrow, and that could be the simplest solution, and hopefully we'll be all done with it.

1477
02:50:52,367 --> 02:50:55,430
[SPEAKER_06]: But we'll keep exploring it.

1478
02:50:55,450 --> 02:50:58,172
[SPEAKER_06]: Paul, did you want to speak about the EL?

1479
02:50:58,292 --> 02:51:00,193
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep, of course you could come up and speak.

1480
02:51:00,333 --> 02:51:01,474
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course.

1481
02:51:01,914 --> 02:51:08,840
[SPEAKER_33]: So just to make it clear, there's also civil rights that are involved regarding the EL program.

1482
02:51:09,723 --> 02:51:15,651
[SPEAKER_33]: For example, you have different levels of students with English proficiency, as was also stated in all the subject areas.

1483
02:51:16,372 --> 02:51:23,643
[SPEAKER_33]: So yes, you can say, OK, we can move two teachers over to the Andrews, but that's not going to make the content.

1484
02:51:24,360 --> 02:51:27,001
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I understand if we have to hire four additional teachers.

1485
02:51:27,442 --> 02:51:31,083
[SPEAKER_08]: I understand that if you don't have the staffing, but we're all just trying also.

1486
02:51:31,104 --> 02:51:41,929
[SPEAKER_33]: And we can also take a walk around the Andrews and see what space is available because I can tell you right now I'm housing every single classroom possible.

1487
02:51:42,649 --> 02:51:46,231
[SPEAKER_33]: So we're going to have to get real creative with, with spacing as well.

1488
02:51:46,912 --> 02:51:49,473
[SPEAKER_33]: Just something to throw out there as well as when you're thinking.

1489
02:51:50,293 --> 02:51:53,314
[SPEAKER_33]: about doing it, not saying that that's never going to be the case.

1490
02:51:53,374 --> 02:52:05,058
[SPEAKER_33]: Now, again, we're going to be talking at the admin meeting, but there's also new accountability rules that are coming out as well, as well as, you know, yeah, equity between the two schools.

1491
02:52:05,698 --> 02:52:17,062
[SPEAKER_33]: If you have four there, you need four that, you know, you need four at the other one, but we also have to make sure the program's working in the right way, making sure that we're covering every student's civil rights as well and getting what they need.

1492
02:52:17,749 --> 02:52:30,757
[SPEAKER_06]: And I believe, you know, Mr. Tixera's not here this evening, but I believe that we, that the superintendent, he did explore that earlier this year, and Mr. Tixera did not recommend it, so we'll have to go back when I see him tomorrow to his thinking on that.

1493
02:52:31,117 --> 02:52:32,919
[SPEAKER_06]: But we'll have the discussion, because we'll all be together.

1494
02:52:35,480 --> 02:52:37,241
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Russo, wanted a follow-up on that?

1495
02:52:37,321 --> 02:52:38,022
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, just one follow-up.

1496
02:52:38,302 --> 02:52:43,305
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just wanted to be clear, you know, that we could send half the kids to each school,

1497
02:52:49,977 --> 02:52:56,979
[SPEAKER_11]: We could have a policy that half of the children from each school will go to each middle school and move no programs.

1498
02:52:59,280 --> 02:53:01,380
[SPEAKER_11]: All ELL students could stay in the McGlynn.

1499
02:53:02,000 --> 02:53:05,161
[SPEAKER_11]: The TLP students could all stay at the Andrews.

1500
02:53:05,341 --> 02:53:06,822
[SPEAKER_11]: Those are not in conflict.

1501
02:53:07,642 --> 02:53:14,544
[SPEAKER_11]: There are sufficient spaces if we decided that half the Brooks kids will go here, half will go there, half the Columbus kids.

1502
02:53:14,764 --> 02:53:17,545
[SPEAKER_11]: There are more than enough spaces to accomplish

1503
02:53:18,193 --> 02:53:25,601
[SPEAKER_11]: keeping the programmatic stuff where it is and get half the Brooks kids to each school, half the Columbus kids to each school, half the Roberts kids.

1504
02:53:26,341 --> 02:53:33,188
[SPEAKER_11]: We will run into the issue of the McGlynn children that were looking for the K through 8 experience.

1505
02:53:33,669 --> 02:53:37,913
[SPEAKER_11]: And so we would have to explore how that would work out.

1506
02:53:38,614 --> 02:53:39,995
[SPEAKER_24]: That was one of our options.

1507
02:53:41,193 --> 02:53:52,224
[SPEAKER_24]: but I think at the time we thought we would at least try this one last time so that we could see if voluntarily people would make a commitment and go over to the McGlynn.

1508
02:53:53,145 --> 02:54:01,673
[SPEAKER_24]: Based on everything you heard tonight, there's enough reason to try it, but I do understand they want to know that the school is in solid hands.

1509
02:54:03,857 --> 02:54:12,542
[SPEAKER_24]: There's trust right now, and I think people need to continue that, but hopefully they get that commitment in the very near future, and I think that could sway things.

1510
02:54:13,743 --> 02:54:14,503
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. Benedetto.

1511
02:54:14,883 --> 02:54:15,223
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1512
02:54:17,225 --> 02:54:19,686
[SPEAKER_22]: There's a lot of good ideas and a lot of things we need to do.

1513
02:54:19,806 --> 02:54:31,212
[SPEAKER_22]: What we need is what we discussed with our candidates, is a short-term plan for next year, and we need to look at the bigger environment, because other than bodies,

1514
02:54:32,389 --> 02:54:42,375
[SPEAKER_22]: There are a lot of different things that we need to do, but I don't think doing that in May for September is feasible right now, even though I agree with your long-term idea, okay?

1515
02:54:42,535 --> 02:54:51,140
[SPEAKER_22]: Because I think that will handle a lot of the other demographics that need to be addressed, but I don't think we'll have enough time.

1516
02:54:51,641 --> 02:54:52,581
[SPEAKER_22]: I like your idea.

1517
02:54:52,761 --> 02:55:00,246
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't want to target one school to stay there, because I think opening it up, as you suggested, is gonna be,

1518
02:55:01,570 --> 02:55:07,034
[SPEAKER_22]: more productive for our community and not targeting people directly.

1519
02:55:07,194 --> 02:55:16,582
[SPEAKER_22]: And I liked what you said about clinging to people on your microphone and saying, please step up now because we do need this help.

1520
02:55:16,742 --> 02:55:18,983
[SPEAKER_22]: We don't want to make these decisions for the parents.

1521
02:55:19,304 --> 02:55:25,308
[SPEAKER_22]: We want parents to be a partner with us deciding how to handle this situation that we're in.

1522
02:55:25,869 --> 02:55:27,410
[SPEAKER_22]: And that's all I really have to say.

1523
02:55:29,628 --> 02:55:30,329
[SPEAKER_14]: Just two things.

1524
02:55:30,369 --> 02:55:42,281
[SPEAKER_14]: I think first, part of my thinking about the McGlynn was simply because the hopefully principal elect, I'll say that, was a proximity.

1525
02:55:42,661 --> 02:55:45,204
[SPEAKER_14]: However, clearly it does make more sense for him also

1526
02:55:46,500 --> 02:55:52,443
[SPEAKER_14]: if he takes the position to reach out to other students and other families, and we might need to figure out a way to do that.

1527
02:55:53,044 --> 02:56:02,028
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, ultimately, when we made the decision, it was really based on finances and put the groups of ELL students together.

1528
02:56:02,368 --> 02:56:07,671
[SPEAKER_14]: That did disrupt our racial balance plan, which I do have a copy of, and really was

1529
02:56:09,390 --> 02:56:15,476
[SPEAKER_14]: these schools came out, there was an initial racial balance plan and how we're going to do it and how we select schools.

1530
02:56:15,976 --> 02:56:20,380
[SPEAKER_14]: And it might be beneficial for the committee to just be aware of what that plan is.

1531
02:56:20,420 --> 02:56:23,923
[SPEAKER_14]: So we'll talk about that at our next meeting too.

1532
02:56:23,943 --> 02:56:25,425
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll make sure that people get a copy of it.

1533
02:56:27,186 --> 02:56:27,606
[SPEAKER_24]: Very good.

1534
02:56:27,907 --> 02:56:29,288
[SPEAKER_24]: Motion to table this paper?

1535
02:56:29,308 --> 02:56:30,089
[SPEAKER_24]: No, one more.

1536
02:56:30,329 --> 02:56:30,549
[SPEAKER_24]: Ms.

1537
02:56:30,609 --> 02:56:31,050
[SPEAKER_24]: Mostone.

1538
02:56:32,329 --> 02:56:36,591
[SPEAKER_07]: suggested that Mr. Tucci is debating on whether he would like to stay as principal?

1539
02:56:36,611 --> 02:56:43,855
[SPEAKER_07]: We've had conversations, and again, I want to give him the freedom to make a choice.

1540
02:56:44,356 --> 02:56:45,516
[SPEAKER_06]: So we've had conversations.

1541
02:56:45,556 --> 02:56:46,497
[SPEAKER_06]: He's entertaining it.

1542
02:56:46,677 --> 02:56:51,440
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's not like you said, by Friday, so we can tell the public that the Magdalene will have a principal in September.

1543
02:56:51,460 --> 02:56:51,560
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1544
02:56:51,800 --> 02:56:57,643
[SPEAKER_06]: I've asked, I talked to him, I believe it was last week, and I've asked him to take two weeks and think about it.

1545
02:56:58,424 --> 02:57:00,665
[SPEAKER_07]: So we want to make sure that... So the end of next week.

1546
02:57:01,493 --> 02:57:02,193
[SPEAKER_07]: at the end of next week.

1547
02:57:03,193 --> 02:57:05,254
[SPEAKER_07]: So that is the 18th?

1548
02:57:06,014 --> 02:57:07,394
[SPEAKER_07]: It's close, yeah.

1549
02:57:07,414 --> 02:57:07,614
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1550
02:57:08,254 --> 02:57:09,335
[SPEAKER_07]: Or I can talk to him sooner.

1551
02:57:10,495 --> 02:57:11,455
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that would be helpful.

1552
02:57:12,655 --> 02:57:13,375
[SPEAKER_06]: I will talk to him sooner.

1553
02:57:13,395 --> 02:57:13,916
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Ruggiero.

1554
02:57:14,716 --> 02:57:15,856
[SPEAKER_06]: I will talk to him tomorrow.

1555
02:57:16,676 --> 02:57:17,036
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1556
02:57:17,216 --> 02:57:17,436
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

1557
02:57:17,456 --> 02:57:18,657
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Ruggiero, you all set?

1558
02:57:18,677 --> 02:57:19,197
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah.

1559
02:57:19,217 --> 02:57:19,497
[SPEAKER_24]: All set?

1560
02:57:20,037 --> 02:57:23,178
[SPEAKER_24]: Is there a motion on the floor to table this paper for two weeks from tonight?

1561
02:57:23,478 --> 02:57:24,658
[SPEAKER_24]: Offered by Mr. Ruggiero.

1562
02:57:25,955 --> 02:57:26,675
[SPEAKER_24]: Seconded by Ms.

1563
02:57:26,695 --> 02:57:27,316
[SPEAKER_24]: Van der Kloot.

1564
02:57:29,036 --> 02:57:29,797
[SPEAKER_24]: All those in favor?

1565
02:57:30,817 --> 02:57:31,498
[SPEAKER_24]: All those opposed?

1566
02:57:31,558 --> 02:57:32,198
[SPEAKER_24]: Motion passes.

1567
02:57:32,458 --> 02:57:33,258
[SPEAKER_24]: Tabling the paper.

1568
02:57:33,278 --> 02:57:34,239
[SPEAKER_24]: It'll come back two weeks.

1569
02:57:36,380 --> 02:57:36,680
[SPEAKER_24]: Of course.

1570
02:57:40,242 --> 02:57:40,742
[SPEAKER_24]: OK.

1571
02:57:43,843 --> 02:57:50,046
[SPEAKER_24]: Report on trainer issue and MIAA policy related to soccer game at Beverly High School.

1572
02:57:52,507 --> 02:57:53,328
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Superintendent.

1573
02:57:54,443 --> 02:58:06,907
[SPEAKER_29]: So as you remember in the fall, there was a situation in which one of our players got hurt and there was an issue about whether the trainer at Beverly High School properly attended to this individual and what was going on.

1574
02:58:07,007 --> 02:58:23,213
[SPEAKER_29]: So subsequent to that, we've done a number of research items and we've talked about things and I want to read a statement so that the record is clear as to what we think happened and that Mrs. Simonides has some comfort as to her considerations.

1575
02:58:25,378 --> 02:58:35,143
[SPEAKER_29]: This email is intended to provide, or an email at the time, information regarding the soccer injury that occurred during the game with Beverly High School this fall.

1576
02:58:35,964 --> 02:58:45,169
[SPEAKER_29]: Consultation with the Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association tells us that the organization considers the situation to be a local matter.

1577
02:58:46,049 --> 02:58:49,331
[SPEAKER_29]: The requirement to provide certified trainers does not cover all sports.

1578
02:58:49,932 --> 02:58:52,333
[SPEAKER_29]: Football and hockey do require a trainer to be present

1579
02:58:52,737 --> 02:58:53,837
[SPEAKER_29]: but other sports do not.

1580
02:58:54,557 --> 02:58:55,558
[SPEAKER_29]: This includes soccer.

1581
02:58:56,178 --> 02:59:03,920
[SPEAKER_29]: The MIAA suggests that coaches and referees must take responsibility to determine if a player should not re-enter a game after an injury.

1582
02:59:04,500 --> 02:59:07,441
[SPEAKER_29]: The cost for certified trainers at every game would be prohibitive.

1583
02:59:08,381 --> 02:59:16,863
[SPEAKER_29]: As a result, Medford will intensify its training of our coaches and consider hiring an assistant trainer for certain sports to supplement our current staffing.

1584
02:59:17,664 --> 02:59:27,671
[SPEAKER_29]: Coaches will be instructed to exclude any Medford player who suffers a concussion or any other major injury unless the player is properly examined and cleared by a qualified trainer.

1585
02:59:28,532 --> 02:59:34,977
[SPEAKER_29]: Any student who suffers such an injury will require a written follow-up report and a subsequent examination by a qualified physician.

1586
02:59:35,857 --> 02:59:46,205
[SPEAKER_29]: It is also important to note that under MIA rules 56.4, that a trainer, if present, is responsible for both teams when the medical person for the visiting team is not on site.

1587
02:59:47,290 --> 02:59:52,694
[SPEAKER_29]: The Beverly Public Schools has indicated they will not be rehiring their current trainer going forward.

1588
02:59:54,235 --> 02:59:57,558
[SPEAKER_29]: They have advertised for contracted training service for next year.

1589
02:59:58,599 --> 03:00:04,904
[SPEAKER_29]: The Medford Public Schools will initiate a discussion with the Northeast Conference Schools on the issue of appropriate trainer coverage.

1590
03:00:05,965 --> 03:00:12,410
[SPEAKER_29]: I believe that the above steps are a significant response to the issue, and additional steps may emerge after those kinds of discussions.

1591
03:00:13,362 --> 03:00:14,142
[SPEAKER_29]: I'd like to thank Ms.

1592
03:00:14,242 --> 03:00:17,643
[SPEAKER_29]: Simonides for her diligence on this matter.

1593
03:00:18,403 --> 03:00:23,444
[SPEAKER_29]: Our on-field cameras, evidence, and subsequent investigation supports our interpretation of the events at Beverly.

1594
03:00:24,144 --> 03:00:27,045
[SPEAKER_29]: We appreciate her commitment to ensuring safety for student athletes.

1595
03:00:30,545 --> 03:00:31,185
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Russo.

1596
03:00:32,186 --> 03:00:39,047
[SPEAKER_11]: I just really have to, I mean, the MIA's statement about this being cost prohibitive,

1597
03:00:40,400 --> 03:00:51,283
[SPEAKER_11]: This sentence rubs me so terribly, because what it really is saying is the financial cost is acceptable to be borne by the risk to the student's safety.

1598
03:00:51,983 --> 03:00:56,444
[SPEAKER_11]: And those two things, one has risen to be more important, and that is the money.

1599
03:01:02,583 --> 03:01:04,704
[SPEAKER_11]: What is the purpose of MIA?

1600
03:01:05,125 --> 03:01:07,046
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it really not safety?

1601
03:01:07,746 --> 03:01:10,668
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm just really disturbed by that statement.

1602
03:01:11,989 --> 03:01:15,951
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I bet it's cost prohibitive to have them for football.

1603
03:01:17,252 --> 03:01:19,794
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it cheap for football to have trainers?

1604
03:01:20,274 --> 03:01:21,435
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

1605
03:01:22,195 --> 03:01:26,518
[SPEAKER_11]: So why is it, in one way, one situation acceptable and the other one not?

1606
03:01:26,578 --> 03:01:31,641
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm just beyond disturbed that that's their excuse for why it's not their problem.

1607
03:01:33,118 --> 03:01:34,019
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just wanted to rant.

1608
03:01:34,220 --> 03:01:34,540
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1609
03:01:35,181 --> 03:01:41,109
[SPEAKER_29]: So I just would say that ultimately it doesn't need a problem because we'd be paying the bill.

1610
03:01:41,490 --> 03:01:43,813
[SPEAKER_29]: See, I think they could say, oh, you've got to have one.

1611
03:01:44,454 --> 03:01:46,597
[SPEAKER_29]: But the reality is, is that how many sports do we have, Bob?

1612
03:01:49,548 --> 03:01:52,812
[SPEAKER_29]: 21 sports, and let's say in every season there's four or five sports.

1613
03:01:52,832 --> 03:01:55,154
[SPEAKER_29]: I mean, you'd have to have people at every event.

1614
03:01:55,174 --> 03:01:58,638
[SPEAKER_29]: There's JVs, there's freshmen, there's all kinds of activities.

1615
03:01:59,038 --> 03:01:59,919
[SPEAKER_29]: It would be difficult.

1616
03:02:00,820 --> 03:02:03,523
[SPEAKER_29]: So one way to do it is to differentiate staffing.

1617
03:02:03,543 --> 03:02:11,792
[SPEAKER_29]: We do that with education too in many ways, is to make sure that the people who are on site know enough to respond.

1618
03:02:12,638 --> 03:02:17,300
[SPEAKER_29]: to take youngsters out of games and not, you just listen to the kids saying, I wanna go back in, I wanna go back in.

1619
03:02:18,061 --> 03:02:23,123
[SPEAKER_29]: Or to call for medical help and get the youngster to medical help on site.

1620
03:02:24,183 --> 03:02:28,145
[SPEAKER_29]: Some sports are obviously more combative and more physical.

1621
03:02:28,666 --> 03:02:31,027
[SPEAKER_29]: There's a higher likelihood of injury.

1622
03:02:31,567 --> 03:02:34,268
[SPEAKER_29]: So there's a balance wheel here that we can think of.

1623
03:02:34,348 --> 03:02:38,630
[SPEAKER_29]: If we hire another assistant trainer or some of the time for some of the sports, we will have gone a long way.

1624
03:02:39,171 --> 03:02:42,132
[SPEAKER_29]: If we intensify our coaches training,

1625
03:02:42,769 --> 03:02:51,857
[SPEAKER_29]: And we worked with the trainers who from other communities will have gone a long way to at least cover the basics that need to be covered and then move from there.

1626
03:02:52,418 --> 03:02:57,142
[SPEAKER_29]: But I think, you know, if you think about a trainer, a trainer is going to cost us $60,000, $70,000 a piece.

1627
03:02:57,782 --> 03:03:01,926
[SPEAKER_29]: So, you know, it's not like it's a, you know, a small investment.

1628
03:03:02,006 --> 03:03:03,327
[SPEAKER_11]: Just a quick question about this.

1629
03:03:03,547 --> 03:03:08,572
[SPEAKER_11]: So is there no model for communities to work together?

1630
03:03:09,530 --> 03:03:13,612
[SPEAKER_11]: whoever, the conference that we're in, I mean, our soccer players are presumably going to Canada.

1631
03:03:15,714 --> 03:03:17,055
[SPEAKER_11]: We know who we will play.

1632
03:03:18,135 --> 03:03:29,122
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there no model for sharing this particular, I mean, the idea that sometimes teams come together and they both have a trainer at $60,000, $70,000 a year, that's kind of insane.

1633
03:03:29,802 --> 03:03:38,027
[SPEAKER_11]: And why wouldn't they be sharing resources and schedule, I mean, the schedule for games is not like every morning you wake up and you guess where you're going.

1634
03:03:38,878 --> 03:03:46,185
[SPEAKER_29]: So typically the home team provides the trainer, but on that day, for example, there were at least three games going on simultaneously.

1635
03:03:46,665 --> 03:03:49,688
[SPEAKER_29]: So trainers on three different fields, moving back and forth.

1636
03:03:50,448 --> 03:04:03,841
[SPEAKER_29]: So, you know, it's obviously a situation where, you know, more is always better, but still, there can be a lot done to mitigate an injury by a person who's watchful,

1637
03:04:05,048 --> 03:04:10,310
[SPEAKER_29]: not putting a youngster back in the game, calling for medical help, doing what they have to do.

1638
03:04:10,690 --> 03:04:11,811
[SPEAKER_29]: We can go a long way with that.

1639
03:04:11,831 --> 03:04:18,614
[SPEAKER_29]: And I think it's very rare that we have a situation that would be totally medical.

1640
03:04:19,314 --> 03:04:20,955
[SPEAKER_29]: Like in football, you have the ambulance on the field.

1641
03:04:21,195 --> 03:04:22,155
[SPEAKER_29]: The ambulance is there.

1642
03:04:22,836 --> 03:04:32,660
[SPEAKER_29]: Other sports, it's more of the, let's say, less, let's say, lethal.

1643
03:04:33,862 --> 03:04:34,523
[SPEAKER_29]: all kinds of injuries.

1644
03:04:34,643 --> 03:04:36,144
[SPEAKER_24]: Soccer is known for concussions.

1645
03:04:36,164 --> 03:04:38,266
[SPEAKER_24]: Soccer and lacrosse and the other two sports, they don't hurt.

1646
03:04:38,306 --> 03:04:41,408
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, you get concussions and the like, but usually it's not, you know.

1647
03:04:43,530 --> 03:04:45,311
[SPEAKER_29]: Well, it depends on the injury, I guess.

1648
03:04:45,892 --> 03:04:46,032
[SPEAKER_04]: Ms.

1649
03:04:46,072 --> 03:04:46,352
[SPEAKER_04]: Kreatz.

1650
03:04:46,933 --> 03:04:47,473
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

1651
03:04:47,773 --> 03:04:50,135
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to make sure that Ms.

1652
03:04:50,195 --> 03:04:51,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Simonettis received this report.

1653
03:04:52,017 --> 03:04:52,417
[SPEAKER_04]: She'll get it.

1654
03:04:52,437 --> 03:04:52,778
[SPEAKER_04]: She did?

1655
03:04:52,918 --> 03:04:54,439
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, and I want to- She will get it.

1656
03:04:54,459 --> 03:04:54,899
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, she will?

1657
03:04:55,740 --> 03:04:56,000
[SPEAKER_04]: She did?

1658
03:04:56,340 --> 03:04:57,982
[SPEAKER_29]: She already has it now, because I gave it to her.

1659
03:04:58,242 --> 03:05:02,666
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, all right, I just wanted to make sure, and I just wanted to also thank her very much for her diligence

1660
03:05:03,427 --> 03:05:05,889
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, communicating all this information to us.

1661
03:05:06,249 --> 03:05:10,832
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been a long time and, you know, I'm happy to hear and receive this report tonight.

1662
03:05:11,292 --> 03:05:11,633
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1663
03:05:12,173 --> 03:05:12,934
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Ruggiero?

1664
03:05:13,054 --> 03:05:17,317
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to remind the body that soccer is the leading cause of concussion among women and girls.

1665
03:05:18,197 --> 03:05:20,979
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's also in the top two or three among boys.

1666
03:05:21,360 --> 03:05:24,882
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's a serious concussion risk in soccer.

1667
03:05:24,922 --> 03:05:27,364
[SPEAKER_10]: People don't think it's a contact sport, but it really is.

1668
03:05:27,444 --> 03:05:29,845
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's often caused, I mean, my wife sees it.

1669
03:05:31,745 --> 03:05:36,010
[SPEAKER_24]: So motion to place this report on file by Ms.

1670
03:05:36,050 --> 03:05:37,152
[SPEAKER_24]: Mostone, seconded by Ms.

1671
03:05:37,192 --> 03:05:37,612
[SPEAKER_24]: Vandekoot.

1672
03:05:37,652 --> 03:05:38,293
[SPEAKER_24]: All those in favor?

1673
03:05:38,313 --> 03:05:38,393
[SPEAKER_24]: Aye.

1674
03:05:39,194 --> 03:05:39,735
[SPEAKER_24]: All those opposed?

1675
03:05:39,755 --> 03:05:40,516
[SPEAKER_24]: Motion passes.

1676
03:05:41,277 --> 03:05:43,820
[SPEAKER_24]: Report on partnership with Lesley University.

1677
03:05:47,204 --> 03:06:04,175
[SPEAKER_24]: Over the past several months, the city of Medford, school department primarily, and Lesley University, high-ranking officials in Lesley University, in addition, Bob Maloney, Mark Grumley, it's been kind of a full-court press of meetings with this university.

1678
03:06:05,035 --> 03:06:13,561
[SPEAKER_24]: What brought them to Medford was a desperate need for some athletic space, predominantly the wood floor.

1679
03:06:13,881 --> 03:06:15,542
[SPEAKER_24]: They would like a wood floor at the high school.

1680
03:06:16,396 --> 03:06:17,657
[SPEAKER_24]: and also tennis courts.

1681
03:06:18,397 --> 03:06:19,778
[SPEAKER_24]: That's what brought them to Medford.

1682
03:06:19,818 --> 03:06:24,860
[SPEAKER_24]: But once they were in Medford, we realized how much more they can offer to this community.

1683
03:06:25,880 --> 03:06:34,864
[SPEAKER_24]: I've been meeting with several organizations that try to train coaches and school systems in how to deal with trauma.

1684
03:06:35,364 --> 03:06:38,546
[SPEAKER_24]: Leslie's training people to do that type of work.

1685
03:06:39,306 --> 03:06:42,847
[SPEAKER_24]: So they have students that will be looking for internships and co-ops.

1686
03:06:44,768 --> 03:06:56,755
[SPEAKER_24]: to learn in the field how to be great teachers, how to be great social workers, et cetera.

1687
03:06:57,516 --> 03:07:01,118
[SPEAKER_24]: So we think it's a great idea to move forward with Lesley University.

1688
03:07:01,838 --> 03:07:07,902
[SPEAKER_24]: The one contractual item would be for the use of the courts in the cages at Medford High School.

1689
03:07:08,902 --> 03:07:11,363
[SPEAKER_24]: NCAA requires they be wood floors.

1690
03:07:11,444 --> 03:07:13,485
[SPEAKER_24]: We do not obviously have wood floors right now.

1691
03:07:14,345 --> 03:07:22,810
[SPEAKER_24]: So they would be making an investment in our cages to put in state-of-the-art wood floors, also the scoring mechanism.

1692
03:07:23,790 --> 03:07:25,071
[SPEAKER_24]: What other things in the cages?

1693
03:07:25,171 --> 03:07:27,592
[SPEAKER_29]: Well, they'll be cleaning it up, they'll be painting, they'll be doing lighting.

1694
03:07:27,612 --> 03:07:36,037
[SPEAKER_24]: Painting, cleaning it, lighting, plus paying us a fee every year to basically rent the space through this partnership.

1695
03:07:36,797 --> 03:07:38,858
[SPEAKER_24]: Duggar would go through the city side of things.

1696
03:07:39,339 --> 03:07:41,560
[SPEAKER_24]: Right now they have a permit to use Duggar Park.

1697
03:07:42,139 --> 03:07:45,921
[SPEAKER_24]: for their tennis courts, but they also would like to have a commitment going forward.

1698
03:07:46,321 --> 03:07:53,506
[SPEAKER_24]: So we will be working with them on an agreement and likewise, they will be making improvements to the tennis courts, which our high school team plays on.

1699
03:07:53,566 --> 03:07:54,506
[SPEAKER_24]: That's their home courts.

1700
03:07:55,187 --> 03:07:57,188
[SPEAKER_24]: So we look at it as a win-win opportunity.

1701
03:07:58,048 --> 03:07:58,369
[SPEAKER_24]: We think

1702
03:07:59,895 --> 03:08:10,400
[SPEAKER_24]: We wanted to speak to the school committee about it to get your thoughts but we think it's really something very positive for the school system and to have that partnership with Lesley University for our students as well.

1703
03:08:11,340 --> 03:08:16,643
[SPEAKER_24]: Hopefully it'll be a matriculation opportunity and we're just very excited about it.

1704
03:08:17,143 --> 03:08:18,664
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Superintendent.

1705
03:08:18,904 --> 03:08:22,986
[SPEAKER_29]: So one of the things that we've talked a lot about is inclusive education.

1706
03:08:23,646 --> 03:08:26,427
[SPEAKER_29]: Lesley has a center for inclusive education.

1707
03:08:27,068 --> 03:08:27,748
[SPEAKER_29]: Lesley has

1708
03:08:28,311 --> 03:08:33,514
[SPEAKER_29]: specializations for the kinds of things that we have been talking about over and over again.

1709
03:08:34,174 --> 03:08:42,699
[SPEAKER_29]: They've got specializations for social and emotional learning and trauma and things that we can't have the expertise locally.

1710
03:08:42,819 --> 03:08:43,840
[SPEAKER_29]: It's just too extensive.

1711
03:08:44,460 --> 03:08:45,601
[SPEAKER_29]: But we can work that out.

1712
03:08:47,482 --> 03:08:50,884
[SPEAKER_29]: President of Lesley College actively participated in this.

1713
03:08:50,924 --> 03:08:52,405
[SPEAKER_29]: This is not low level.

1714
03:08:53,345 --> 03:08:56,267
[SPEAKER_29]: And we think that their proximity to us

1715
03:08:57,323 --> 03:09:06,849
[SPEAKER_29]: And the type of programs that they specialize in, the type of university they are, because universities have specializations, is a great fit for what we're doing.

1716
03:09:07,590 --> 03:09:18,857
[SPEAKER_29]: It also provides us opportunities for professional development for our teachers, professional development for other staff members, and it provides possible some opportunities for adult learning as well.

1717
03:09:19,517 --> 03:09:26,662
[SPEAKER_29]: So there's this tremendous potential here that will be cost effective and that will not interfere

1718
03:09:27,287 --> 03:09:30,628
[SPEAKER_29]: with our otherwise operations, and will help us upgrade our facilities.

1719
03:09:31,208 --> 03:09:32,028
[SPEAKER_29]: This is a win-win.

1720
03:09:32,769 --> 03:09:41,271
[SPEAKER_29]: So we've got to move forward, because I don't think we're going to get this opportunity again, because they're going to try to find something else if they can't work with us, and they've got a short window.

1721
03:09:42,131 --> 03:09:45,352
[SPEAKER_29]: And we just want to, we just think it's something we should be supporting.

1722
03:09:46,653 --> 03:09:47,473
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. Benedetto.

1723
03:09:47,693 --> 03:09:55,115
[SPEAKER_22]: First of all, the mayor has said that she's been working on this for months, and this is the first that this body is hearing of this proposal.

1724
03:09:55,468 --> 03:10:00,696
[SPEAKER_22]: There is such a lack of information given to us this night.

1725
03:10:01,817 --> 03:10:03,620
[SPEAKER_22]: When will they be using our facilities?

1726
03:10:03,680 --> 03:10:05,383
[SPEAKER_22]: How much money will they be providing?

1727
03:10:05,463 --> 03:10:07,646
[SPEAKER_22]: How many courses will our teachers get to take?

1728
03:10:08,027 --> 03:10:12,269
[SPEAKER_22]: This one-page thing does not tell me anything about this program.

1729
03:10:12,609 --> 03:10:17,932
[SPEAKER_22]: And if we need to act quickly, then maybe we should have heard about it before the middle of May.

1730
03:10:18,813 --> 03:10:20,874
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm sorry, but I'm really not happy.

1731
03:10:20,994 --> 03:10:23,475
[SPEAKER_22]: And we're trying to talk about security.

1732
03:10:23,835 --> 03:10:25,156
[SPEAKER_22]: Is this for their games?

1733
03:10:25,296 --> 03:10:28,177
[SPEAKER_22]: Is there going to be spectators in our school gyms?

1734
03:10:28,317 --> 03:10:29,958
[SPEAKER_22]: When will they be played?

1735
03:10:30,058 --> 03:10:31,939
[SPEAKER_22]: How is security going to be handled?

1736
03:10:32,179 --> 03:10:33,860
[SPEAKER_22]: This is a big commitment.

1737
03:10:33,920 --> 03:10:36,982
[SPEAKER_22]: This isn't a one-pager at the end of a night

1738
03:10:37,482 --> 03:10:50,430
[SPEAKER_22]: So I would like to table this discussion until we have more information from the district so that we can review a lot more questions and not have this brought before us in this manner at this late time of the evening.

1739
03:10:50,630 --> 03:10:50,990
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1740
03:10:51,010 --> 03:10:52,471
[SPEAKER_24]: Will you withdraw your tabling just so Ms.

1741
03:10:52,531 --> 03:10:53,712
[SPEAKER_24]: Vianna Klug could make a comment?

1742
03:10:53,752 --> 03:10:53,972
[SPEAKER_22]: No.

1743
03:10:56,973 --> 03:10:57,754
[SPEAKER_22]: I said no.

1744
03:10:59,815 --> 03:11:00,976
[SPEAKER_24]: Tabling is undebatable.

1745
03:11:02,176 --> 03:11:04,398
[SPEAKER_24]: On the motion to table the paper, all those in favor?

1746
03:11:06,937 --> 03:11:07,937
[SPEAKER_24]: The chair is in doubt.

1747
03:11:09,638 --> 03:11:10,418
[SPEAKER_24]: The chair is in doubt.

1748
03:11:10,438 --> 03:11:11,378
[SPEAKER_24]: Roll call, please, Ms.

1749
03:11:11,418 --> 03:11:11,738
[SPEAKER_24]: Kreatz.

1750
03:11:15,799 --> 03:11:16,119
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

1751
03:11:25,602 --> 03:11:27,663
[SPEAKER_24]: This is a motion to table the paper.

1752
03:11:27,703 --> 03:11:28,423
[SPEAKER_24]: It's undebatable.

1753
03:11:33,416 --> 03:11:34,838
[SPEAKER_24]: We can't talk about it right now.

1754
03:11:35,058 --> 03:11:39,542
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, if she withdrew it or if it fails, we can talk about it and we can still re-table it at the end.

1755
03:11:39,963 --> 03:11:40,203
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

1756
03:11:40,483 --> 03:11:40,663
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

1757
03:11:59,198 --> 03:11:59,378
[SPEAKER_24]: No.

1758
03:11:59,819 --> 03:12:01,901
[SPEAKER_24]: Two in the affirmative, five in the negative.

1759
03:12:01,921 --> 03:12:03,122
[SPEAKER_24]: Motion fails.

1760
03:12:04,323 --> 03:12:04,463
[SPEAKER_24]: Ms.

1761
03:12:04,563 --> 03:12:04,923
[SPEAKER_24]: Van der Kloot.

1762
03:12:05,564 --> 03:12:08,306
[SPEAKER_14]: So, because I think there are a lot of questions surrounding this.

1763
03:12:08,326 --> 03:12:09,187
[SPEAKER_14]: Of course, there should be.

1764
03:12:09,207 --> 03:12:11,049
[SPEAKER_14]: And we definitely need more information.

1765
03:12:11,890 --> 03:12:18,095
[SPEAKER_14]: I would move the paper to a committee of the whole so that we can discuss it as soon as possible.

1766
03:12:20,918 --> 03:12:21,098
[SPEAKER_24]: Ms.

1767
03:12:21,138 --> 03:12:21,598
[SPEAKER_24]: Mustone.

1768
03:12:22,059 --> 03:12:22,739
[SPEAKER_24]: Division three.

1769
03:12:23,040 --> 03:12:23,200
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1770
03:12:27,735 --> 03:12:30,636
[SPEAKER_24]: they do have other sports, but that's predominantly what we're talking about.

1771
03:12:31,956 --> 03:12:34,917
[SPEAKER_24]: Really, we're talking basketball and cages.

1772
03:12:36,398 --> 03:12:43,160
[SPEAKER_14]: We would also, at that meeting, is very much want to make sure to have an understanding

1773
03:12:44,475 --> 03:12:47,776
[SPEAKER_14]: the impact on our student usage at the same time.

1774
03:12:49,116 --> 03:12:50,637
[SPEAKER_14]: And security, obviously.

1775
03:12:50,677 --> 03:12:53,177
[SPEAKER_14]: Obviously is a priority.

1776
03:12:53,337 --> 03:13:00,519
[SPEAKER_14]: I have a thing about the windows in the gym, and man, if they would replace the windows.

1777
03:13:01,559 --> 03:13:02,259
[SPEAKER_24]: The cow wall?

1778
03:13:06,592 --> 03:13:06,832
[SPEAKER_14]: Of course.

1779
03:13:06,852 --> 03:13:07,533
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, yes.

1780
03:13:07,753 --> 03:13:07,973
[SPEAKER_14]: So.

1781
03:13:08,533 --> 03:13:12,176
[SPEAKER_24]: On the motion that the paper be referred to Committee of the Whole, authored by Ms.

1782
03:13:12,196 --> 03:13:13,837
[SPEAKER_24]: Van der Kloot, seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

1783
03:13:13,857 --> 03:13:14,638
[SPEAKER_24]: All those in favor?

1784
03:13:15,198 --> 03:13:15,298
[SPEAKER_24]: Aye.

1785
03:13:15,418 --> 03:13:16,099
[SPEAKER_24]: All those opposed?

1786
03:13:16,139 --> 03:13:16,779
[SPEAKER_24]: Motion passes.

1787
03:13:17,020 --> 03:13:17,360
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1788
03:13:24,645 --> 03:13:26,927
[SPEAKER_24]: Report on ALICE program feedback.

1789
03:13:49,734 --> 03:13:50,075
[SPEAKER_09]: Staff?

1790
03:13:51,546 --> 03:13:57,010
[SPEAKER_09]: And the first question is, what are some of the key points learned about ALICE in the presentation?

1791
03:13:57,430 --> 03:14:00,772
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm just going to go through a few of the points that I thought were pertinent.

1792
03:14:01,673 --> 03:14:06,456
[SPEAKER_09]: And one was that teachers have options in crisis situation using ALICE.

1793
03:14:07,476 --> 03:14:12,039
[SPEAKER_09]: It puts students in a safe place, and then they are to alert authorities.

1794
03:14:12,860 --> 03:14:15,742
[SPEAKER_09]: They can learn developmentally appropriate responses.

1795
03:14:15,782 --> 03:14:17,182
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that was important for me.

1796
03:14:18,298 --> 03:14:24,645
[SPEAKER_09]: with my pre-k to grade five hat to make sure that we're appropriate developmentally with our children.

1797
03:14:24,665 --> 03:14:32,434
[SPEAKER_09]: And what I thought was very interesting was that you call police instead of 911 and you would get a quicker response.

1798
03:14:33,417 --> 03:14:38,062
[SPEAKER_09]: The second question that was asked was, what do you believe are some of the benefits of ALICE?

1799
03:14:38,743 --> 03:14:51,258
[SPEAKER_09]: And our staff said the options for safety, different solutions for various age groups, alerting staff with common language, which I think is very important, and they felt it was a proactive approach.

1800
03:14:54,078 --> 03:14:57,360
[SPEAKER_09]: What concerns do you have about implementing ALICE in the district?

1801
03:14:58,061 --> 03:15:08,608
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the main concerns was the cost with our staff, the timeline for approval and for training, reservations at the elementary level, and the raised level of anxiety for students.

1802
03:15:09,108 --> 03:15:13,731
[SPEAKER_09]: Once again, I was very passionate about that, because I worry about the little ones.

1803
03:15:15,092 --> 03:15:22,998
[SPEAKER_09]: The timetable moving forward, we don't want to scare or frighten our children, and we need a lot of parent input on this.

1804
03:15:24,183 --> 03:15:32,771
[SPEAKER_09]: And the last question that we asked was, please list suggestions or statements for future district trainings related to school safety and security.

1805
03:15:33,712 --> 03:15:38,116
[SPEAKER_09]: And our teachers said security is up to date and the training is effective.

1806
03:15:38,676 --> 03:15:46,683
[SPEAKER_09]: The meetings on communication, what to do if, additional school resource offices is something that teachers would like to see.

1807
03:15:48,825 --> 03:15:50,667
[SPEAKER_09]: All drills should be taken seriously.

1808
03:15:51,514 --> 03:15:58,621
[SPEAKER_09]: We need to create potential preventative measures and look at the mental health of our students as well.

1809
03:15:59,602 --> 03:16:03,106
[SPEAKER_09]: So interestingly enough, I've been in touch with Tewksbury Public Schools.

1810
03:16:03,767 --> 03:16:07,150
[SPEAKER_09]: They are going to have a training or a drill, a real drill.

1811
03:16:08,932 --> 03:16:09,453
[SPEAKER_09]: Excuse me.

1812
03:16:09,993 --> 03:16:10,474
[SPEAKER_09]: End of the night.

1813
03:16:10,714 --> 03:16:11,395
[SPEAKER_09]: Can't talk anymore.

1814
03:16:13,187 --> 03:16:14,388
[SPEAKER_09]: on May 18th.

1815
03:16:14,428 --> 03:16:22,335
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would like to take a team of teachers and maybe some administrators over to one of the schools in Tewksbury.

1816
03:16:22,755 --> 03:16:31,402
[SPEAKER_09]: Shannon Demos, who's one of our assistant principals, is from Tewksbury, and she's setting this up for me, for a 5-6 drill and for a 7-8 drill.

1817
03:16:32,303 --> 03:16:41,751
[SPEAKER_09]: And unfortunately, the K-4 was done in November, so there's no opportunity to see the little ones, but that is something that I'm looking forward to doing on May 18th.

1818
03:16:43,387 --> 03:16:44,508
[SPEAKER_24]: Great.

1819
03:16:44,548 --> 03:16:45,068
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Russo.

1820
03:16:46,068 --> 03:16:46,748
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

1821
03:16:47,609 --> 03:16:52,311
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, there was one thing on this report that sort of jumped out at me.

1822
03:16:53,891 --> 03:17:02,395
[SPEAKER_11]: In all conversations around ALICE that I have heard from the community and from proponents of ALICE, it was, why isn't Medford doing it?

1823
03:17:02,555 --> 03:17:04,156
[SPEAKER_11]: Literally everybody does it.

1824
03:17:05,256 --> 03:17:08,698
[SPEAKER_11]: And to see 100 schools, I mean, are there more than 100 schools in Massachusetts?

1825
03:17:08,738 --> 03:17:11,739
[SPEAKER_11]: I think there's a lot more than 100 schools in Massachusetts.

1826
03:17:12,253 --> 03:17:20,498
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just think that the hyperbole of we're the only ones not doing it needs to be called out, because it really angered me when I read this.

1827
03:17:21,538 --> 03:17:26,261
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought we were literally the only ones not doing it.

1828
03:17:26,361 --> 03:17:32,264
[SPEAKER_11]: The drills twice a year, I mean, if we're going to do it, then we've got to really do it.

1829
03:17:32,725 --> 03:17:39,789
[SPEAKER_11]: And how many more drills can we put our kids through when they're all doing MCAS all the time, too?

1830
03:17:42,720 --> 03:17:47,003
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, the other issue I have, oh, can you invite me on the 18th in case?

1831
03:17:47,683 --> 03:17:48,403
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.

1832
03:17:48,604 --> 03:17:53,266
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, we have a quorum, but I actually am available, so I would like to go.

1833
03:17:54,307 --> 03:17:54,627
[SPEAKER_11]: That's all.

1834
03:17:54,907 --> 03:17:55,268
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1835
03:17:55,288 --> 03:17:55,708
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like that.

1836
03:17:57,349 --> 03:17:57,429
[SPEAKER_24]: Ms.

1837
03:17:57,449 --> 03:17:58,329
[SPEAKER_24]: Van der Kloot.

1838
03:17:58,950 --> 03:18:05,874
[SPEAKER_14]: Going forward with this, if that's what we ought to do, I mean, I would really, this is something where I really would like to have the superintendent-elect involved.

1839
03:18:06,307 --> 03:18:12,209
[SPEAKER_14]: I think they've done by something that part of the discussion is I think they've done Alice in Boston.

1840
03:18:12,269 --> 03:18:20,092
[SPEAKER_14]: So, and so I just, you know, I, I think it will be, I'm very glad you're going out.

1841
03:18:20,713 --> 03:18:25,955
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that if we, if the new superintendent elect has had,

1842
03:18:27,329 --> 03:18:37,313
[SPEAKER_14]: some experience with this, that we want to certainly be talking to her right now about this specific item, and wish that you would bring it up, and experience and whatnot.

1843
03:18:37,653 --> 03:18:54,120
[SPEAKER_14]: I will say, Doctor, I'm sorry, at the Fisk School in Lexington, Mr. Martelone, just, they were doing it, and you know, I hope that he would at least be willing to still have a conversation with us.

1844
03:18:54,820 --> 03:18:56,181
[SPEAKER_14]: He just might be very useful in

1845
03:18:57,607 --> 03:18:58,587
[SPEAKER_14]: saying how it goes.

1846
03:18:58,767 --> 03:19:04,189
[SPEAKER_14]: I do know a teacher who's out there, and I certainly will pursue that to have a conversation with them.

1847
03:19:04,289 --> 03:19:06,029
[SPEAKER_14]: But if we could reach out to him as well.

1848
03:19:06,729 --> 03:19:07,089
[SPEAKER_24]: Very good.

1849
03:19:07,269 --> 03:19:07,629
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1850
03:19:08,670 --> 03:19:08,990
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1851
03:19:10,530 --> 03:19:15,491
[SPEAKER_24]: Motion to receive this report and place it on file by Mr. Giro, seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

1852
03:19:15,511 --> 03:19:16,271
[SPEAKER_24]: All those in favor?

1853
03:19:16,292 --> 03:19:16,352
[SPEAKER_24]: Aye.

1854
03:19:17,092 --> 03:19:17,772
[SPEAKER_24]: All those opposed?

1855
03:19:18,112 --> 03:19:18,872
[SPEAKER_24]: Motion passes.

1856
03:19:19,752 --> 03:19:22,073
[SPEAKER_24]: Pre-budget report mathematics.

1857
03:19:28,118 --> 03:19:29,559
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you so much for your patience.

1858
03:19:32,362 --> 03:19:34,403
[SPEAKER_16]: No problem at all.

1859
03:19:34,543 --> 03:19:35,524
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, everyone.

1860
03:19:35,604 --> 03:19:39,908
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll be brief and just go through my overview.

1861
03:19:40,008 --> 03:19:42,190
[SPEAKER_16]: I think everybody has the full report.

1862
03:19:42,911 --> 03:19:44,772
[SPEAKER_16]: This is the pre-budget report.

1863
03:19:45,413 --> 03:19:54,881
[SPEAKER_16]: And our program in mathematics, again, is based on the Massachusetts State Framework for Mathematics, which was revised in March of 2017.

1864
03:19:56,880 --> 03:20:05,506
[SPEAKER_16]: So I've been in the process of revising all our curriculum documents, elementary report cards, in order to reflect the changes.

1865
03:20:06,007 --> 03:20:13,052
[SPEAKER_16]: Some were cosmetic, but there was a few standard shifts in our K through 12 program.

1866
03:20:14,733 --> 03:20:22,759
[SPEAKER_16]: And our practices are aligned with our program materials at all levels.

1867
03:20:23,527 --> 03:20:28,531
[SPEAKER_16]: At the middle school, we have 13 mathematics teachers.

1868
03:20:28,952 --> 03:20:34,937
[SPEAKER_16]: And at the high school, 15 instructional teachers all have their math licenses.

1869
03:20:35,758 --> 03:20:40,242
[SPEAKER_16]: And the highlights of the school is, like I said, the curriculum revision.

1870
03:20:40,842 --> 03:20:44,705
[SPEAKER_16]: The middle school is still reviewing programs.

1871
03:20:45,706 --> 03:20:50,971
[SPEAKER_16]: They have some pilots that they feel very strongly about that they want to continue for another year.

1872
03:20:51,541 --> 03:20:53,442
[SPEAKER_16]: because changes have been made.

1873
03:20:54,202 --> 03:21:08,686
[SPEAKER_16]: Some program materials they just received in April as new additions, so they want to be very responsive to the needs of the students, yet on the other hand, they want to be responsible fiscally.

1874
03:21:09,166 --> 03:21:11,987
[SPEAKER_16]: So this is a big dollar amount.

1875
03:21:12,347 --> 03:21:17,029
[SPEAKER_16]: So all the teachers have the new materials in the classrooms.

1876
03:21:17,529 --> 03:21:20,710
[SPEAKER_16]: We're trying to do an even split on two of the pilots.

1877
03:21:21,117 --> 03:21:30,242
[SPEAKER_16]: and they're also looking at an online program that's available that is highly rated nationally.

1878
03:21:30,262 --> 03:21:47,433
[SPEAKER_16]: We're in our second year of implementation of the new program for Algebra I, Geometry, and Algebra II at the high school, and all students participate in this, our English learners, our special education students, and things are going well.

1879
03:21:47,493 --> 03:21:49,394
[SPEAKER_16]: There's quite a bit of collaboration.

1880
03:21:49,918 --> 03:21:51,219
[SPEAKER_16]: amongst the faculty.

1881
03:21:52,300 --> 03:21:53,340
[SPEAKER_16]: It's very healthy.

1882
03:21:53,801 --> 03:21:56,523
[SPEAKER_16]: They work on common assessments.

1883
03:21:56,643 --> 03:21:58,344
[SPEAKER_16]: They talk about pacing.

1884
03:21:59,104 --> 03:22:04,668
[SPEAKER_16]: So our students are really benefiting from their collaboration.

1885
03:22:05,589 --> 03:22:10,673
[SPEAKER_16]: The professional development this year, again, focused in best practices.

1886
03:22:11,653 --> 03:22:18,258
[SPEAKER_16]: One initiative that we've just started, which will go into the next school year, is on math protocols.

1887
03:22:18,762 --> 03:22:23,683
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's a partnership between the mathematics department and special educators.

1888
03:22:24,084 --> 03:22:25,184
[SPEAKER_16]: And this is K through 12.

1889
03:22:26,584 --> 03:22:32,866
[SPEAKER_16]: And learning different procedures and protocols for teaching mathematics that will benefit all students.

1890
03:22:33,246 --> 03:22:36,027
[SPEAKER_16]: So we just finished a train the trainers.

1891
03:22:36,167 --> 03:22:37,647
[SPEAKER_16]: We did a leadership training.

1892
03:22:38,508 --> 03:22:43,729
[SPEAKER_16]: They will be doing a planning meeting in June or late May.

1893
03:22:45,390 --> 03:22:46,850
[SPEAKER_16]: We're still looking at some dates.

1894
03:22:47,502 --> 03:22:51,465
[SPEAKER_16]: and how to roll it out to the entire K-12 faculty.

1895
03:22:52,766 --> 03:23:08,657
[SPEAKER_16]: In addition to that, at the elementary level, we had our professional development focused on the standards for mathematical practice, so what it actually looks like in the classroom, and the rigor and such.

1896
03:23:11,439 --> 03:23:15,522
[SPEAKER_16]: And at the middle and high school, we're going back and

1897
03:23:16,416 --> 03:23:20,640
[SPEAKER_16]: taking a look at what was working for us pre-Common Core.

1898
03:23:21,340 --> 03:23:23,422
[SPEAKER_16]: And it was, we wrote a lot.

1899
03:23:23,842 --> 03:23:26,184
[SPEAKER_16]: We used manipulatives.

1900
03:23:27,125 --> 03:23:36,813
[SPEAKER_16]: So kind of stepping back a little bit from virtual manipulatives and knowing that with the diversity in our population, sometimes it's best to do hands-on.

1901
03:23:37,194 --> 03:23:43,299
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're focusing on that and in writing and mathematics to increase achievement.

1902
03:23:43,713 --> 03:23:52,440
[SPEAKER_16]: The teachers, some of them are using this as their student learning goal and they are showing improvement in their students.

1903
03:23:52,460 --> 03:23:55,422
[SPEAKER_16]: They're documenting and collecting data on that.

1904
03:23:57,544 --> 03:24:02,468
[SPEAKER_16]: We, so as I said, we have an integration of students.

1905
03:24:03,008 --> 03:24:11,555
[SPEAKER_16]: At the high school, it's the vocational technical students or the high school students are taking the same math courses together

1906
03:24:12,050 --> 03:24:15,112
[SPEAKER_16]: especially the algebra one and geometry.

1907
03:24:15,652 --> 03:24:26,560
[SPEAKER_16]: And when the vocational students are more academic program, they're able to filter in in some of the other courses because they don't do the week on week off.

1908
03:24:27,280 --> 03:24:29,401
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's easier to promote that.

1909
03:24:30,142 --> 03:24:35,585
[SPEAKER_16]: And then we have good integration of EL students now at the high school.

1910
03:24:35,986 --> 03:24:37,807
[SPEAKER_16]: It's really mostly newcomers.

1911
03:24:38,267 --> 03:24:50,726
[SPEAKER_16]: that have a substantially separate classroom, but that teacher collaborates with the teachers in the department, and the classroom is with and among the other math teachers.

1912
03:24:51,979 --> 03:24:56,621
[SPEAKER_16]: The, let me see, I'm going through this quickly for you.

1913
03:24:57,041 --> 03:25:00,163
[SPEAKER_16]: A collaboration outreach is very strong.

1914
03:25:01,564 --> 03:25:19,472
[SPEAKER_16]: Really, one thing that's most noteworthy is that just crossed my desk this week was we have seven students who will be going to MIT this summer for, I'd say, a program with Lincoln Labs, no cost at all to the families.

1915
03:25:20,073 --> 03:25:32,115
[SPEAKER_16]: So the students, what they've done is they've, in partnership with their program, they are taking online courses in programming.

1916
03:25:32,655 --> 03:25:38,576
[SPEAKER_16]: In the background, we have people at MIT who are watching their progress.

1917
03:25:39,076 --> 03:25:44,317
[SPEAKER_16]: And then the students are invited into the summer program if they're successful.

1918
03:25:44,677 --> 03:25:47,898
[SPEAKER_16]: So we've been very successful to have seven students

1919
03:25:48,375 --> 03:25:52,919
[SPEAKER_16]: invited in, and I believe six are definite to go.

1920
03:25:52,979 --> 03:26:01,387
[SPEAKER_16]: We're still waiting on one, because these are mostly sophomores and juniors, and some of them need to work during the summer.

1921
03:26:01,907 --> 03:26:06,291
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's kind of the trade-off, but it's a great experience.

1922
03:26:06,911 --> 03:26:09,153
[SPEAKER_16]: MIT had approached me last year.

1923
03:26:09,374 --> 03:26:14,258
[SPEAKER_16]: Last year we had four students accepted, so it's great this year that we have seven.

1924
03:26:15,007 --> 03:26:19,911
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's a national program, so students are coming from all over the country to participate.

1925
03:26:19,931 --> 03:26:21,152
[SPEAKER_16]: So this is a great one.

1926
03:26:22,553 --> 03:26:25,895
[SPEAKER_16]: Tufts University continues to be a good partner.

1927
03:26:26,295 --> 03:26:28,577
[SPEAKER_16]: So they come whenever we call.

1928
03:26:29,738 --> 03:26:34,701
[SPEAKER_16]: We have an intern in the department, and we had one previous year.

1929
03:26:35,122 --> 03:26:42,387
[SPEAKER_16]: And then we also have speakers come in, and a nice relationship there with the computer science department.

1930
03:26:43,665 --> 03:26:55,950
[SPEAKER_16]: Wentworth Institute, they come in, and they've talked to the high school students in the area of applied math, and that's for all levels of students, but mostly juniors.

1931
03:26:56,010 --> 03:27:00,932
[SPEAKER_16]: They want them to start thinking about where they're going to be going to school the next years.

1932
03:27:01,532 --> 03:27:04,293
[SPEAKER_16]: We have a partnership with Harvard University.

1933
03:27:04,853 --> 03:27:12,796
[SPEAKER_16]: It's an Algebra I project, and it is two years, so next year will be the second year of our involvement

1934
03:27:13,062 --> 03:27:17,686
[SPEAKER_16]: So we have teachers at the middle and the high school level who are involved with that.

1935
03:27:17,846 --> 03:27:23,271
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's learning different strategies to teach Algebra 1.

1936
03:27:24,612 --> 03:27:29,996
[SPEAKER_16]: And again, MIDE has been wonderful to us.

1937
03:27:30,937 --> 03:27:38,984
[SPEAKER_16]: Their program at the McGlynn Middle School is to help strengthen students' application of engineering

1938
03:27:39,883 --> 03:27:45,007
[SPEAKER_16]: And in that, with science and mathematics.

1939
03:27:45,427 --> 03:27:53,993
[SPEAKER_16]: So the students are seeing what they're learning in those content areas, then moves into the engineering.

1940
03:27:54,353 --> 03:27:59,797
[SPEAKER_16]: They have been great partners for our robotics team, our BAPO team.

1941
03:27:59,857 --> 03:28:02,959
[SPEAKER_16]: They fully fund their participation.

1942
03:28:03,580 --> 03:28:07,823
[SPEAKER_16]: This year, Medford came in fourth in the double elimination.

1943
03:28:09,155 --> 03:28:12,038
[SPEAKER_16]: and the other teams were quite strong.

1944
03:28:12,518 --> 03:28:21,565
[SPEAKER_16]: They have that, usually their schools have a course where we just have the course in our vocational technical school.

1945
03:28:22,466 --> 03:28:29,412
[SPEAKER_16]: The students who participate come from both schools, but they do this after school as a club.

1946
03:28:29,432 --> 03:28:32,474
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're really proud of what they've done this year.

1947
03:28:33,475 --> 03:28:38,419
[SPEAKER_16]: And we've tried to increase our participation with the parents and

1948
03:28:39,408 --> 03:28:43,089
[SPEAKER_16]: to bring them more into the classroom to see what the mathematics is about.

1949
03:28:43,449 --> 03:28:57,611
[SPEAKER_16]: So we had early in the year, we opened up elementary classrooms in every school and parents and guardians were able to go through and kind of experience a typical math class.

1950
03:28:58,272 --> 03:29:01,872
[SPEAKER_16]: And we did that also at the high school level for the first time this year.

1951
03:29:02,312 --> 03:29:05,353
[SPEAKER_16]: And it was very well received by parents that came away.

1952
03:29:06,002 --> 03:29:07,603
[SPEAKER_16]: learning a little bit of the math.

1953
03:29:07,783 --> 03:29:13,246
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think all of those who were able to come down and attend, I know it meant a lot to the teachers.

1954
03:29:14,187 --> 03:29:15,808
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, and like I said, this is new.

1955
03:29:16,248 --> 03:29:19,350
[SPEAKER_16]: We hope they hope to be able to do more again.

1956
03:29:19,450 --> 03:29:22,412
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just that everybody's schedule is so tight.

1957
03:29:22,792 --> 03:29:27,795
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, there's so many things going on in the city that people have to choose.

1958
03:29:28,775 --> 03:29:31,397
[SPEAKER_16]: And, um, so, so it's kind of in,

1959
03:29:32,135 --> 03:29:34,536
[SPEAKER_16]: in a nutshell, some of the things that we've been doing.

1960
03:29:35,897 --> 03:29:38,798
[SPEAKER_16]: Use of our funding from last year.

1961
03:29:39,539 --> 03:29:54,506
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, we were paying for our textbook adoption at the high school level, the instructional program materials, and that goes K through 12, but primarily middle and high school.

1962
03:29:56,127 --> 03:29:56,807
[SPEAKER_16]: And then the

1963
03:29:58,665 --> 03:30:02,728
[SPEAKER_16]: allotment for the office supplies is for departmental purposes.

1964
03:30:03,769 --> 03:30:13,976
[SPEAKER_16]: So how the budget requests differ this year to next year is more on the area of personnel.

1965
03:30:14,856 --> 03:30:24,263
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm requesting that we put in place a math teacher and a math lab at the McGlynn Middle School.

1966
03:30:24,323 --> 03:30:25,844
[SPEAKER_16]: We have that at the Andrews.

1967
03:30:26,348 --> 03:30:28,590
[SPEAKER_16]: but it does not exist at the McGlynn.

1968
03:30:28,850 --> 03:30:46,426
[SPEAKER_16]: So we would like to have a licensed teacher put in place there and, um, you know, to help with the math program, um, do some intervention and, uh, just kind of help moving students along before, you know, they get too far behind.

1969
03:30:47,086 --> 03:30:50,910
[SPEAKER_16]: So we'd like you to consider funding a position there.

1970
03:30:51,492 --> 03:30:53,753
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'd like to put out a strong call.

1971
03:30:53,813 --> 03:30:55,394
[SPEAKER_16]: I ask for this every year.

1972
03:30:55,995 --> 03:31:01,318
[SPEAKER_16]: But there is a need for math coaches in the elementary schools.

1973
03:31:01,938 --> 03:31:07,202
[SPEAKER_16]: But if we had one in every building, they could serve more purposes.

1974
03:31:08,542 --> 03:31:16,067
[SPEAKER_16]: We need data specialists, and they could help the principals take a look at data, examine the data.

1975
03:31:17,688 --> 03:31:20,610
[SPEAKER_16]: And then they can also help with the intervention.

1976
03:31:21,245 --> 03:31:26,486
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, identify those students, prescribe what's needed for them, and

1977
03:31:27,319 --> 03:31:30,602
[SPEAKER_16]: if their schedule allows, actually work with the students.

1978
03:31:31,262 --> 03:31:36,307
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's something that I would like you to think about.

1979
03:31:36,327 --> 03:31:43,793
[SPEAKER_16]: Those items are very costly because it comes with salary, benefits, and everything else.

1980
03:31:43,833 --> 03:31:44,874
[SPEAKER_16]: We're aware of it.

1981
03:31:45,394 --> 03:31:53,421
[SPEAKER_16]: But every year, we look at scores, and everyone's wondering, you know, how are the students doing on MCAS?

1982
03:31:53,921 --> 03:31:56,003
[SPEAKER_16]: And math comes up, but we have to realize

1983
03:31:56,477 --> 03:31:59,178
[SPEAKER_16]: that there are some supports that are needed.

1984
03:31:59,939 --> 03:32:13,365
[SPEAKER_16]: And, you know, I think when you talk to the new superintendent, they'll be familiar with the role of math coaches in Boston schools and then our surrounding location.

1985
03:32:13,845 --> 03:32:17,226
[SPEAKER_16]: But I think those would help move us along.

1986
03:32:17,767 --> 03:32:21,548
[SPEAKER_16]: So the textbooks budget is the same as last year.

1987
03:32:21,568 --> 03:32:22,829
[SPEAKER_16]: We still owe one payment.

1988
03:32:24,458 --> 03:32:25,218
[SPEAKER_16]: on the high school.

1989
03:32:26,779 --> 03:32:29,360
[SPEAKER_16]: Instructional materials could stay the same.

1990
03:32:29,800 --> 03:32:40,964
[SPEAKER_16]: Even if we added the personnel, I should be able to get some of the materials for those people out of the instructional piece and the office supplies.

1991
03:32:41,945 --> 03:32:43,145
[SPEAKER_16]: So if you have any questions.

1992
03:32:44,486 --> 03:32:45,906
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Russo's first, then Ms.

1993
03:32:45,926 --> 03:32:46,346
[SPEAKER_24]: Van der Kloot.

1994
03:32:47,307 --> 03:32:48,427
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

1995
03:32:49,427 --> 03:32:53,089
[SPEAKER_11]: So other than the data analysis,

1996
03:32:55,222 --> 03:32:57,383
[SPEAKER_11]: What is a math coach doing?

1997
03:32:59,004 --> 03:33:07,627
[SPEAKER_16]: So the math coach goes into the classroom, makes observations of what the needs might be.

1998
03:33:08,347 --> 03:33:16,831
[SPEAKER_16]: So actually looks at teacher's practices and how the students are responding to the practices in the classroom and sits and coaches.

1999
03:33:17,091 --> 03:33:24,374
[SPEAKER_16]: So then they find a common planning time where they sit and they meet and improve upon the teacher's practice.

2000
03:33:24,841 --> 03:33:31,185
[SPEAKER_16]: Sometimes the coach will actually teach the lesson and show this is what a model lesson looks like.

2001
03:33:31,545 --> 03:33:35,528
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's a very close dance that they do together.

2002
03:33:35,988 --> 03:33:45,334
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's the primary role of the math coach is to improve teacher performance, which again will improve the student performance.

2003
03:33:46,135 --> 03:33:46,675
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2004
03:33:47,355 --> 03:33:48,076
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2005
03:33:48,096 --> 03:33:48,136
[SPEAKER_24]: Ms.

2006
03:33:48,156 --> 03:33:49,277
[SPEAKER_24]: Van der Kloot.

2007
03:33:49,297 --> 03:33:54,620
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to ask whether the collaboration with Midday is expected to continue next year.

2008
03:33:55,719 --> 03:33:58,501
[SPEAKER_16]: That is our hopes that we will continue it.

2009
03:33:59,542 --> 03:34:01,263
[SPEAKER_16]: We started small.

2010
03:34:01,423 --> 03:34:04,005
[SPEAKER_16]: They didn't know how many engineers that have available.

2011
03:34:04,025 --> 03:34:07,728
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it's been a big success story all around.

2012
03:34:07,788 --> 03:34:16,875
[SPEAKER_16]: They've been welcomed, as you heard earlier this evening, by the teachers and found a good fit for those classes.

2013
03:34:17,375 --> 03:34:23,160
[SPEAKER_16]: So those conversations and how to schedule, then we can bring in the principal.

2014
03:34:23,813 --> 03:34:24,774
[SPEAKER_16]: and do the scheduling.

2015
03:34:25,235 --> 03:34:37,470
[SPEAKER_14]: I just think that that's such a strong addition right now, and that's something that we should be marketing, if you would, to prospective students of saying, hey, you know, and I've seen photographs.

2016
03:34:37,510 --> 03:34:38,872
[SPEAKER_14]: I was over at Midea one day.

2017
03:34:38,932 --> 03:34:43,137
[SPEAKER_14]: I've talked extensively to them, and they see it as a positive, a win-win.

2018
03:34:44,060 --> 03:34:46,101
[SPEAKER_14]: their engineers are having a great time with the kids.

2019
03:34:46,661 --> 03:34:50,742
[SPEAKER_14]: So I just, I think that many parents don't know that it exists.

2020
03:34:51,222 --> 03:34:53,243
[SPEAKER_14]: So I would like us to see that.

2021
03:34:53,583 --> 03:34:59,725
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd also like to thank you for all of your years of work with the Medford Public Schools and leading the department.

2022
03:34:59,825 --> 03:35:09,487
[SPEAKER_14]: We know that you're on the retirement list and I'm sure that must be a little bittersweet, but I just want to make sure that I take a moment to thank you.

2023
03:35:10,428 --> 03:35:10,768
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2024
03:35:12,349 --> 03:35:19,712
[SPEAKER_16]: It's been quite a journey because I came in when accountability started in MCAS and standards.

2025
03:35:19,732 --> 03:35:24,755
[SPEAKER_16]: It's been nine years in this particular position, leadership position.

2026
03:35:25,535 --> 03:35:28,516
[SPEAKER_16]: And then we were with the superintendents.

2027
03:35:29,677 --> 03:35:34,099
[SPEAKER_16]: We put together that science lab that we're all used and love.

2028
03:35:34,199 --> 03:35:38,140
[SPEAKER_16]: And again, that was a lot of work, several years, many hours.

2029
03:35:40,060 --> 03:35:51,804
[SPEAKER_16]: We let that happen, and now we're going into the next iteration of, you know, what are the needs and actually moving things forward and, you know, getting new programs in place.

2030
03:35:52,464 --> 03:35:56,465
[SPEAKER_16]: All those things take time, but I've enjoyed it.

2031
03:35:56,665 --> 03:35:57,985
[SPEAKER_16]: That keeps you going.

2032
03:35:58,686 --> 03:36:03,947
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, listening to everything that's happening, it's like, oh, do I really want to leave?

2033
03:36:04,067 --> 03:36:06,108
[SPEAKER_16]: But I told my family.

2034
03:36:06,658 --> 03:36:07,999
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, it's time.

2035
03:36:08,940 --> 03:36:09,440
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2036
03:36:09,820 --> 03:36:10,201
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

2037
03:36:11,502 --> 03:36:12,142
[SPEAKER_24]: I realize that.

2038
03:36:12,222 --> 03:36:13,023
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Benedetto.

2039
03:36:13,163 --> 03:36:13,523
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

2040
03:36:13,963 --> 03:36:16,285
[SPEAKER_22]: I also want to thank you for all your years of service.

2041
03:36:16,325 --> 03:36:17,626
[SPEAKER_22]: You were my daughter's teacher.

2042
03:36:17,646 --> 03:36:18,687
[SPEAKER_24]: My daughter's too.

2043
03:36:19,007 --> 03:36:19,908
[SPEAKER_24]: In AP.

2044
03:36:21,169 --> 03:36:24,831
[SPEAKER_22]: And you were very tough, very fair.

2045
03:36:25,232 --> 03:36:31,036
[SPEAKER_22]: They learned a tremendous amount that they carried forward with them, not only to college, but in their life.

2046
03:36:32,717 --> 03:36:34,058
[SPEAKER_22]: I appreciate that as a parent.

2047
03:36:34,963 --> 03:36:40,508
[SPEAKER_22]: And as an administrator, you have always been very receptive to the committee and any questions.

2048
03:36:41,369 --> 03:36:44,712
[SPEAKER_22]: And thank you for all your years of service to the community.

2049
03:36:45,053 --> 03:36:45,433
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

2050
03:36:45,453 --> 03:36:47,115
[SPEAKER_22]: It's been a privilege.

2051
03:36:47,695 --> 03:36:48,416
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Ruggiero.

2052
03:36:49,337 --> 03:36:51,078
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you once again for your service.

2053
03:36:51,899 --> 03:36:52,800
[SPEAKER_10]: I just had a quick question.

2054
03:36:53,160 --> 03:36:57,545
[SPEAKER_10]: Do we participate in the American Math Competition, the AMC 8s, AMC 10s, AMC 12s?

2055
03:37:00,081 --> 03:37:06,026
[SPEAKER_16]: We have math teams, but they're not in that particular competition.

2056
03:37:06,486 --> 03:37:09,809
[SPEAKER_16]: But we do have a math team at the high school.

2057
03:37:10,129 --> 03:37:12,411
[SPEAKER_16]: We sort of have a varsity and junior varsity.

2058
03:37:13,011 --> 03:37:17,895
[SPEAKER_16]: And so they, it's most, they don't do the face-to-face competition.

2059
03:37:18,576 --> 03:37:22,479
[SPEAKER_16]: They test and they just send in their scores.

2060
03:37:22,920 --> 03:37:24,461
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, the MTAs are just tests.

2061
03:37:24,541 --> 03:37:27,563
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, and with that,

2062
03:37:28,749 --> 03:37:31,792
[SPEAKER_16]: We encourage all students to participate.

2063
03:37:32,432 --> 03:37:36,616
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's not so much about winning and getting the highest scores.

2064
03:37:36,696 --> 03:37:41,740
[SPEAKER_16]: It's about being part of something and extending their learning.

2065
03:37:42,380 --> 03:37:47,044
[SPEAKER_10]: Do we do that in the middle school, the eighth grade AMCs?

2066
03:37:47,665 --> 03:37:48,846
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't believe.

2067
03:37:48,886 --> 03:37:51,748
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not through my office if it's done.

2068
03:37:51,768 --> 03:37:53,890
[SPEAKER_16]: It could be done as a club.

2069
03:37:55,171 --> 03:37:56,312
[SPEAKER_16]: I can check on that for you.

2070
03:38:00,844 --> 03:38:03,446
[SPEAKER_24]: Motion to accept this report and place it on file.

2071
03:38:04,387 --> 03:38:05,768
[SPEAKER_24]: Seconded by Mr. Azzurro.

2072
03:38:05,828 --> 03:38:06,589
[SPEAKER_24]: All those in favor?

2073
03:38:07,469 --> 03:38:08,150
[SPEAKER_24]: All those opposed?

2074
03:38:08,190 --> 03:38:08,951
[SPEAKER_24]: Motion passes.

2075
03:38:09,991 --> 03:38:13,694
[SPEAKER_24]: We also have the pre-budget report on physical education.

2076
03:38:15,916 --> 03:38:17,057
[SPEAKER_25]: We have an award.

2077
03:38:17,978 --> 03:38:18,238
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

2078
03:38:19,059 --> 03:38:23,202
[SPEAKER_24]: Recommendation to accept gift from the, I'm sorry, J.S.

2079
03:38:23,322 --> 03:38:24,163
[SPEAKER_24]: Lim Foundation.

2080
03:38:25,475 --> 03:38:32,018
[SPEAKER_16]: So I would like to read this so that it's part of publicizing the award.

2081
03:38:32,419 --> 03:38:43,524
[SPEAKER_16]: The JS Limb Foundation has generously offered a gift of $3,000 to Medford High School to encourage students to engage in rigorous mathematics and science studies.

2082
03:38:44,125 --> 03:38:48,587
[SPEAKER_16]: The gift recognizes students for academic excellence in these subjects.

2083
03:38:49,567 --> 03:38:50,788
[SPEAKER_16]: Acceptance of the gift

2084
03:38:51,712 --> 03:38:58,114
[SPEAKER_16]: requires announcement to the sophomores in the spring of 2018 to promote awareness.

2085
03:38:58,734 --> 03:39:11,058
[SPEAKER_16]: Two prizes of $1,000 each are presented to juniors who demonstrate top performance in mathematics and science for the 2018-2019 school year.

2086
03:39:11,958 --> 03:39:20,501
[SPEAKER_16]: An additional $1,000 is designated for administrative costs at the discretion of the awarding committees and headmaster.

2087
03:39:21,167 --> 03:39:26,989
[SPEAKER_16]: The mathematics awarding committee will consist of the director and teachers of the mathematics department.

2088
03:39:27,369 --> 03:39:33,272
[SPEAKER_16]: The science awarding committee will consist of the director and teachers of the science department.

2089
03:39:33,812 --> 03:39:37,593
[SPEAKER_16]: Criteria and selection will meet with the headmaster's approval.

2090
03:39:38,654 --> 03:39:45,697
[SPEAKER_16]: And this foundation was established in 2010 by MIT professor J.S.

2091
03:39:45,857 --> 03:39:46,197
[SPEAKER_16]: Lim.

2092
03:39:47,097 --> 03:39:49,018
[SPEAKER_16]: It's located in Winchester, Mass.

2093
03:39:49,635 --> 03:39:58,598
[SPEAKER_16]: The foundation expresses that in a global marketplace, mathematics and science skills are critical for the next generation of American professionals.

2094
03:39:59,138 --> 03:40:01,778
[SPEAKER_16]: One of our missions is to help U.S.

2095
03:40:01,818 --> 03:40:09,561
[SPEAKER_16]: students reach their fullest potential in these subjects through grants to schools and educational organizations.

2096
03:40:10,461 --> 03:40:17,563
[SPEAKER_16]: In the process, we hope that our initiatives inspire others to make contributions in their communities.

2097
03:40:18,214 --> 03:40:34,199
[SPEAKER_16]: This is the second year that the foundation audited this gift to Medford High School, and the first awarding of prizes to members of the junior class will take place on Thursday, May 17th at the academic awards evening at Medford High School.

2098
03:40:35,099 --> 03:40:35,599
[SPEAKER_22]: Excellent.

2099
03:40:35,959 --> 03:40:36,779
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. Benedetto.

2100
03:40:37,580 --> 03:40:39,280
[SPEAKER_22]: Motion to accept this award.

2101
03:40:39,400 --> 03:40:41,041
[SPEAKER_22]: I always want to take in money.

2102
03:40:42,681 --> 03:40:46,122
[SPEAKER_22]: And thank, could we send a letter of thanks to the foundation?

2103
03:40:47,040 --> 03:40:56,244
[SPEAKER_22]: as well as invite the junior class members to our next meeting that will be receiving these awards, just so we can honor them as well.

2104
03:40:57,385 --> 03:41:04,448
[SPEAKER_24]: And the first awarding of prizes will be held on May 17th at the annual academic award evening at Medford High School.

2105
03:41:05,148 --> 03:41:05,488
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, okay.

2106
03:41:05,528 --> 03:41:09,590
[SPEAKER_24]: There's a motion on the floor for approval of this gift, seconded by Ms.

2107
03:41:09,650 --> 03:41:10,210
[SPEAKER_24]: Van der Kloot.

2108
03:41:10,350 --> 03:41:11,371
[SPEAKER_24]: Roll call vote, please, Ms.

2109
03:41:11,391 --> 03:41:11,651
[SPEAKER_24]: Kreatz.

2110
03:41:13,272 --> 03:41:13,492
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

2111
03:41:22,491 --> 03:41:24,333
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero on the negative.

2112
03:41:24,373 --> 03:41:26,955
[SPEAKER_24]: Motion passes, and we'll also send out a thank you letter.

2113
03:41:27,255 --> 03:41:27,816
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Ms.

2114
03:41:27,876 --> 03:41:29,177
[SPEAKER_24]: Joy, for your years of service.

2115
03:41:29,217 --> 03:41:29,697
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2116
03:41:29,897 --> 03:41:30,278
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2117
03:41:30,298 --> 03:41:36,343
[SPEAKER_24]: OK, report on pre-budget presentation, health and physical education.

2118
03:41:39,045 --> 03:41:39,505
[SPEAKER_24]: Good evening.

2119
03:41:39,866 --> 03:41:42,808
[SPEAKER_17]: Good evening, Mayor Burke, Superintendent Belson, members of the school committee.

2120
03:41:43,308 --> 03:41:44,489
[SPEAKER_17]: It's been a long night for everyone.

2121
03:41:44,509 --> 03:41:45,851
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll be as brief as possible.

2122
03:41:46,811 --> 03:41:51,035
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm just going to go over a few of our accomplishments and then what we're looking for going into next year.

2123
03:41:52,447 --> 03:41:55,669
[SPEAKER_17]: One of the things we got this year was the Youth Opioid Prevention Grant.

2124
03:41:55,989 --> 03:41:56,330
[SPEAKER_17]: That was for $18,000.

2125
03:41:56,970 --> 03:42:04,695
[SPEAKER_17]: And what we did with some of that money is we purchased Michigan model kits for every elementary teacher.

2126
03:42:04,715 --> 03:42:08,357
[SPEAKER_17]: So every elementary teacher at all four elementary schools have their own kit.

2127
03:42:08,777 --> 03:42:12,699
[SPEAKER_17]: So they are teaching the social-emotional learning unit in grades K-5.

2128
03:42:14,320 --> 03:42:18,403
[SPEAKER_17]: We also received the USA Field Hockey Grant for all four elementary schools.

2129
03:42:18,760 --> 03:42:25,585
[SPEAKER_17]: where we were provided curriculum and field hockey equipment to each school, and field hockey was actually added into our curriculum there.

2130
03:42:25,986 --> 03:42:31,270
[SPEAKER_17]: We've also added it at the middle schools, hopefully to gain a little bit more interest in that sport.

2131
03:42:32,451 --> 03:42:40,597
[SPEAKER_17]: We also received the Game Change grant through the New England Patriots, and that was a $3,000 grant, and that's an anti-violence grant.

2132
03:42:41,097 --> 03:42:46,882
[SPEAKER_17]: We had people from Game Change come in and train about 25 high school students,

2133
03:42:47,329 --> 03:42:50,251
[SPEAKER_17]: And they actually brought that down to the middle school students as well.

2134
03:42:50,852 --> 03:42:55,615
[SPEAKER_17]: We've also incorporated some of those lessons into our freshman health curriculum.

2135
03:42:56,035 --> 03:43:00,759
[SPEAKER_17]: So within the past two years, all of our freshmen, all of our sophomores have been trained in it as well.

2136
03:43:01,239 --> 03:43:05,002
[SPEAKER_17]: And we'll continue to bring that down to the health classes at the middle school as well.

2137
03:43:06,703 --> 03:43:12,568
[SPEAKER_17]: We also have introduced lifeguard training course as a physical education elective at the high school.

2138
03:43:14,963 --> 03:43:17,364
[SPEAKER_17]: our course selection catalog for this year.

2139
03:43:17,424 --> 03:43:24,166
[SPEAKER_17]: So next year, students will be able to take that as a physical education elective and get certified right through that class.

2140
03:43:24,926 --> 03:43:31,228
[SPEAKER_17]: So the last thing, we've added yoga units to the K to 8 physical education curriculum.

2141
03:43:32,949 --> 03:43:35,950
[SPEAKER_17]: So I've done one training with my staff.

2142
03:43:35,970 --> 03:43:37,470
[SPEAKER_17]: We're doing another one next week.

2143
03:43:38,390 --> 03:43:38,990
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's K to 8.

2144
03:43:39,491 --> 03:43:40,531
[SPEAKER_17]: We already have it at the high school.

2145
03:43:40,551 --> 03:43:42,432
[SPEAKER_17]: We have a yoga 1 and a yoga 2 class.

2146
03:43:44,606 --> 03:43:54,830
[SPEAKER_17]: Looking forward to next year, I'm looking for level funding for travel, office supplies, textbooks, educational supplies, maintenance of equipment, and for fitness center supervision.

2147
03:43:56,030 --> 03:44:00,331
[SPEAKER_17]: What we are looking for is to increase staffing by two positions.

2148
03:44:01,052 --> 03:44:02,792
[SPEAKER_17]: I have asked for these positions in the past.

2149
03:44:03,172 --> 03:44:07,514
[SPEAKER_17]: Last year, I asked for two health teachers at the middle school, where we got one.

2150
03:44:07,954 --> 03:44:13,356
[SPEAKER_17]: We're looking for one more so that we have one full time at each school, which will help us with

2151
03:44:13,897 --> 03:44:19,179
[SPEAKER_17]: scheduling and making sure that all of our students are getting the Michigan model in 6th, 7th, and 8th grade.

2152
03:44:20,600 --> 03:44:27,262
[SPEAKER_17]: The next piece we're looking for is increase in physical education staffing for an adaptive physical education teacher.

2153
03:44:28,143 --> 03:44:30,584
[SPEAKER_17]: And this is not to take away from inclusion.

2154
03:44:30,604 --> 03:44:32,224
[SPEAKER_17]: We're still including our students.

2155
03:44:32,484 --> 03:44:41,948
[SPEAKER_17]: But this is in addition to help maybe a push-in or co-teaching model where we have that adaptive teacher that can go into classes to help our physical education teachers.

2156
03:44:42,335 --> 03:44:43,977
[SPEAKER_17]: with students that might need extra help.

2157
03:44:46,179 --> 03:44:47,140
[SPEAKER_17]: Does anyone have any questions?

2158
03:44:47,180 --> 03:44:47,440
[SPEAKER_24]: Excellent.

2159
03:44:47,501 --> 03:44:48,301
[SPEAKER_24]: Are there any questions?

2160
03:44:48,682 --> 03:44:49,322
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Russo.

2161
03:44:51,225 --> 03:45:03,778
[SPEAKER_11]: I was a little surprised by, thank you by the way for the report, I was surprised to see that the Brooks and the McGlynn only have one full time PE teacher and then the Columbus has one and a half.

2162
03:45:04,738 --> 03:45:17,149
[SPEAKER_11]: even though the Columbus has like a hundred and something students fewer than the Brooks and even more fewer, if that's a thing, than the McGlynn.

2163
03:45:18,651 --> 03:45:20,512
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there a history?

2164
03:45:20,572 --> 03:45:22,474
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, why is this situation this way?

2165
03:45:22,514 --> 03:45:24,176
[SPEAKER_11]: To me, it seems a little odd.

2166
03:45:25,357 --> 03:45:27,378
[SPEAKER_17]: So when I started the position, that's what we had.

2167
03:45:27,418 --> 03:45:31,342
[SPEAKER_17]: And we do have the... Our teachers' schedules are full.

2168
03:45:32,676 --> 03:45:34,177
[SPEAKER_17]: going back and forth in both schools.

2169
03:45:34,197 --> 03:45:38,681
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know if there's anything else.

2170
03:45:40,182 --> 03:45:44,166
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think there's a balance with the specialists in every building.

2171
03:45:44,186 --> 03:45:52,993
[SPEAKER_09]: If you look at maybe the art teachers in the different buildings, they may have more than the Columbus and the McGlynn have.

2172
03:45:53,053 --> 03:45:55,135
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think it's a balance that they do.

2173
03:45:59,947 --> 03:46:04,490
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure how it began, it was before me, but that's what it looked like years ago.

2174
03:46:04,510 --> 03:46:05,470
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Superintendent.

2175
03:46:05,510 --> 03:46:13,355
[SPEAKER_29]: So another aspect of it is the fact that in some cases we have programs like the TLP program that needs its own person to cover it.

2176
03:46:13,375 --> 03:46:17,117
[SPEAKER_29]: And I mean because you can't mix those kids in as easily as you might like.

2177
03:46:17,858 --> 03:46:26,143
[SPEAKER_29]: Some other specialized programs so that the schedule around them requires a little differentiated staffing.

2178
03:46:26,163 --> 03:46:28,564
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

2179
03:46:28,644 --> 03:46:28,724
[SPEAKER_08]: Ms.

2180
03:46:28,784 --> 03:46:29,345
[SPEAKER_08]: Millstone.

2181
03:46:31,557 --> 03:46:36,819
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I've never even heard of an adaptive physical education teacher, so that seems very exciting.

2182
03:46:37,659 --> 03:46:42,281
[SPEAKER_08]: Is the plan that they would co-teach with Mr. McGlynn at the Roberts?

2183
03:46:43,761 --> 03:46:44,021
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

2184
03:46:44,041 --> 03:46:49,223
[SPEAKER_08]: Would they go in and tell Mr. McGlynn or share ideas with Mr. McGlynn and travel the schools or?

2185
03:46:49,483 --> 03:46:51,243
[SPEAKER_17]: So it would be a teacher for the full district.

2186
03:46:51,343 --> 03:46:51,644
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

2187
03:46:51,764 --> 03:46:55,865
[SPEAKER_17]: We could co-teach and have that teacher go in and teach with physical education teachers.

2188
03:46:56,292 --> 03:47:03,480
[SPEAKER_17]: It could also be a point where we still have students in inclusion, but we give them also an alternative where we also pull out and are able to work one-on-one.

2189
03:47:13,927 --> 03:47:15,228
[SPEAKER_11]: that your staff have.

2190
03:47:17,110 --> 03:47:33,763
[SPEAKER_11]: I was under the impression that this body had adopted safety care across the district, and I wasn't sure who has been trained or has not been trained on that, and you probably don't actually have the answer, but is this new for your staff to do this?

2191
03:47:33,964 --> 03:47:35,345
[SPEAKER_17]: So I know my staff has been trained.

2192
03:47:35,365 --> 03:47:38,487
[SPEAKER_17]: We've been doing it for the past two years, and they have to retrain every year.

2193
03:47:39,028 --> 03:47:40,029
[SPEAKER_11]: It's an every year training.

2194
03:47:42,763 --> 03:47:43,523
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. Benedetto.

2195
03:47:43,743 --> 03:47:44,103
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

2196
03:47:44,844 --> 03:47:52,568
[SPEAKER_22]: That's run out of the special education department is my understanding under Kathy Medaglio and that student services.

2197
03:47:54,269 --> 03:48:00,372
[SPEAKER_22]: I know because at my school, I'm the trainer in safety care and in CPI.

2198
03:48:02,373 --> 03:48:11,037
[SPEAKER_22]: So what happens is that you need a team of teachers that are able to respond to an emergency situation so you can be called away.

2199
03:48:11,655 --> 03:48:26,542
[SPEAKER_22]: And a gym teacher or a physical education teacher or other specialists are usually on that team because they have the most flexibility in their schedule and can respond very quickly to different situations.

2200
03:48:27,262 --> 03:48:34,926
[SPEAKER_22]: Whereas a classroom teacher might have at any given time 20 students in their care and not be able to respond easily.

2201
03:48:36,238 --> 03:48:48,262
[SPEAKER_22]: I call them classroom teachers because they do teach classes of children, but they just have a little bit more flexibility about being around the building.

2202
03:48:50,202 --> 03:48:57,104
[SPEAKER_22]: And they're alone sometimes in different areas of the building, so it's good to have them trained.

2203
03:48:59,926 --> 03:49:04,268
[SPEAKER_24]: There's a motion to accept this report, place it on file by Mr. Giro, seconded by Ms.

2204
03:49:04,328 --> 03:49:04,648
[SPEAKER_24]: Kreatz.

2205
03:49:05,368 --> 03:49:06,128
[SPEAKER_24]: All those in favor?

2206
03:49:06,348 --> 03:49:07,069
[SPEAKER_24]: All those opposed?

2207
03:49:07,149 --> 03:49:07,949
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you very much, Ms.

2208
03:49:07,989 --> 03:49:08,689
[SPEAKER_24]: Perry, as always.

2209
03:49:08,709 --> 03:49:09,029
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2210
03:49:09,209 --> 03:49:10,050
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Rachel.

2211
03:49:14,431 --> 03:49:15,452
[SPEAKER_24]: Financial report.

2212
03:49:20,734 --> 03:49:21,274
[SPEAKER_24]: Good evening, Ms.

2213
03:49:21,354 --> 03:49:21,614
[SPEAKER_24]: Pabst.

2214
03:49:21,674 --> 03:49:22,234
[SPEAKER_19]: Good evening.

2215
03:49:22,254 --> 03:49:25,616
[SPEAKER_19]: I had hoped Rachel would offer up some exercises in between.

2216
03:49:25,656 --> 03:49:26,776
[SPEAKER_19]: I know, wake us up a little.

2217
03:49:26,796 --> 03:49:28,817
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, we'll keep trucking along here.

2218
03:49:32,513 --> 03:49:37,720
[SPEAKER_19]: So the first item we have for you is the financial report.

2219
03:49:38,681 --> 03:49:46,432
[SPEAKER_19]: As a reminder, the document that's provided is the expanded document, budget document, that focuses on the DESE reporting.

2220
03:49:46,895 --> 03:49:49,617
[SPEAKER_19]: by function category, schools, departments.

2221
03:49:50,398 --> 03:49:57,823
[SPEAKER_19]: The bottom line that we are looking at is the total appropriation amount plus the revenue that the schools balance their budget.

2222
03:49:58,464 --> 03:50:11,954
[SPEAKER_19]: So open budget lines were in concert with our past budgets to identify some of those DESE categories and our revenue offsets will be adjusted at year end, just going into the financial reporting.

2223
03:50:12,552 --> 03:50:22,078
[SPEAKER_19]: So again, as the financial report identifies, we approach the final two months projecting a balanced budget for the fiscal year ending 2018.

2224
03:50:22,938 --> 03:50:25,120
[SPEAKER_19]: This has been a very challenging year.

2225
03:50:25,580 --> 03:50:29,983
[SPEAKER_19]: We've had to deal with multiple unexpected and increased cost factors, significant.

2226
03:50:31,384 --> 03:50:41,970
[SPEAKER_19]: Still with those challenges, we've had some resourceful development and applications of supplemental revenue that we will be enabled, the school system to meet its obligations

2227
03:50:42,529 --> 03:50:48,212
[SPEAKER_19]: barring any additional major unforeseen situations that could occur in the next two months.

2228
03:50:49,352 --> 03:50:58,957
[SPEAKER_19]: As we prepare for our upcoming fiscal year and with the new superintendent budget process, we do need to augment several accounts and sustain our resources and revenue generation abilities.

2229
03:50:59,797 --> 03:51:03,959
[SPEAKER_19]: New expenditures must be carefully prioritized and choices will have to be made.

2230
03:51:04,379 --> 03:51:11,723
[SPEAKER_19]: Again, as we hear all the great things that every department and schools want to accomplish, that does impact the

2231
03:51:12,401 --> 03:51:18,083
[SPEAKER_19]: budget and what we will be requesting at the end of our FY19 budget process.

2232
03:51:18,763 --> 03:51:29,186
[SPEAKER_19]: We are also, as you are aware, in collective bargaining with our union personnel, which is significant and going into the FY19 budget without any indication.

2233
03:51:30,197 --> 03:51:36,041
[SPEAKER_19]: Every year at this time, we freeze discretionary funds to monitor the balances through year end.

2234
03:51:36,661 --> 03:51:46,027
[SPEAKER_19]: There are several unexpected additional budget drivers that are being carried at this time without known ending dates, with security overtime as a prime example.

2235
03:51:47,067 --> 03:51:52,911
[SPEAKER_19]: The following we've identified have incurred post-budget approval from fiscal year 2018.

2236
03:51:53,311 --> 03:51:57,694
[SPEAKER_19]: The first item was our regular transportation.

2237
03:51:57,734 --> 03:51:58,414
[SPEAKER_19]: Again, we had

2238
03:51:58,990 --> 03:52:17,026
[SPEAKER_19]: been proactive to reduce one bus and we had to add more than one route back into the schedule for those important programs that were identified post-budget, which were for the newcomers, the additional after-school runs, and new Columbus after-school tutoring programs.

2239
03:52:18,046 --> 03:52:19,808
[SPEAKER_19]: Additionally, homeless transportation

2240
03:52:20,343 --> 03:52:29,874
[SPEAKER_19]: continues to grow despite efforts to mitigate costs by utilizing mileage reimbursements and shared rides and consolidations.

2241
03:52:29,994 --> 03:52:35,480
[SPEAKER_19]: This is an area that impacts many school districts in the Commonwealth, not just Medford.

2242
03:52:36,653 --> 03:52:40,677
[SPEAKER_19]: Audit expenses were significantly different.

2243
03:52:40,717 --> 03:52:45,861
[SPEAKER_19]: We had a new auditor, so those are charged to the schools that are within the school committee area.

2244
03:52:46,662 --> 03:52:49,564
[SPEAKER_19]: Specialized one-to-one nurses for severe needs students.

2245
03:52:49,685 --> 03:52:54,409
[SPEAKER_19]: Those required hiring of nurses that were not anticipated in the FY18 budget.

2246
03:52:55,350 --> 03:52:59,153
[SPEAKER_19]: Additional staffing for the consolidation of the high school and vocational school.

2247
03:53:00,545 --> 03:53:08,551
[SPEAKER_19]: That did also impact the budget, and yet it has been very successful in that implementation and transition.

2248
03:53:10,393 --> 03:53:15,557
[SPEAKER_19]: Security over time, as we know that continues to be a cost factor.

2249
03:53:17,714 --> 03:53:26,816
[SPEAKER_19]: And as we go through the general fund, as we looked at the approval for FY18, it was the $56,431,000, of which we are at 82 percent.

2250
03:53:26,896 --> 03:53:32,857
[SPEAKER_19]: So if you categorize that over 12 months, we are right on track for the last 20 percent over May and June.

2251
03:53:34,378 --> 03:53:42,660
[SPEAKER_19]: We did have the approved free cash vote for security and E-rate items that is added to our bottom line budget, increasing the total amount to $56,925,000.

2252
03:53:45,494 --> 03:53:50,618
[SPEAKER_19]: So again, we identify how many pay periods each bargaining group has received.

2253
03:53:51,359 --> 03:53:59,425
[SPEAKER_19]: When we review the specific categories, salaries is always an area that has fluidity.

2254
03:53:59,965 --> 03:54:08,632
[SPEAKER_19]: The undistributed salary line has been expensed and dispersed to various account deficits in line with where some transition and movement has occurred.

2255
03:54:09,733 --> 03:54:12,135
[SPEAKER_19]: So the special ed categories have historically

2256
03:54:13,013 --> 03:54:22,363
[SPEAKER_19]: not had an affiliated budget amount as much of those amounts are supported by some of the outside revenue offsets that we project and plan as part of the budgeting process.

2257
03:54:22,844 --> 03:54:31,533
[SPEAKER_19]: Again, as we look at the expanded document, those are DESI reporting categories, not necessarily our bottom line item.

2258
03:54:33,603 --> 03:54:44,253
[SPEAKER_19]: We have numerous retirements that will have some contractual vacation and or sick time buybacks that will occur, some within the FY18 and others that can be planned for FY19.

2259
03:54:46,328 --> 03:54:49,429
[SPEAKER_19]: and that's in accordance with their collective bargaining agreement language.

2260
03:54:50,429 --> 03:54:52,590
[SPEAKER_19]: Security continues to be a priority.

2261
03:54:53,330 --> 03:54:58,492
[SPEAKER_19]: We continue to demonstrate the commitment for ensuring the safety at all the school site locations.

2262
03:54:59,212 --> 03:55:03,213
[SPEAKER_19]: Again, we've added the cameras, locks, and door monitoring coverage.

2263
03:55:03,933 --> 03:55:10,375
[SPEAKER_19]: However, the unanticipated level of overtime in this category continues to impact the budget right now.

2264
03:55:11,170 --> 03:55:18,492
[SPEAKER_19]: and was not planned for in reference to the additional overtime component.

2265
03:55:19,213 --> 03:55:24,434
[SPEAKER_19]: And a long-term funding solution will need to be addressed and or planned going forward.

2266
03:55:25,775 --> 03:55:38,139
[SPEAKER_19]: Technology, the commitment of infusing $102,000 of funding into the schools at the beginning of the year was accommodated in order to have that utilization over the course of fiscal year 18.

2267
03:55:39,327 --> 03:55:56,416
[SPEAKER_19]: that did provide additional support for testing and instructional support district-wide, and we will continue to make those technology improvements with the E-rate funding and the upgrades that are intended to take place over the summer to be ready for the FY19 school year.

2268
03:55:57,657 --> 03:56:08,543
[SPEAKER_19]: Our utilities, we always try to be conservative in budgeting and projecting in that category, and we encumber based on historical years usage and what we anticipate the

2269
03:56:09,826 --> 03:56:13,848
[SPEAKER_19]: contractual amounts to be going forward next year, beginning in November of 2018.

2270
03:56:13,928 --> 03:56:20,651
[SPEAKER_19]: We will have a change in the electricity rate, so we will have to plan and project for that.

2271
03:56:21,611 --> 03:56:24,872
[SPEAKER_19]: Currently, the natural gas rates are favorable.

2272
03:56:24,972 --> 03:56:36,437
[SPEAKER_19]: However, we have seen an increase in our therm usage due to some of the cold winter months, and we will have expenditures higher in that line item prior than the previous year.

2273
03:56:37,499 --> 03:56:39,921
[SPEAKER_19]: for that purpose because of the higher therm usage.

2274
03:56:41,042 --> 03:56:50,430
[SPEAKER_19]: The second half of the expense activity was timeframe January through March, so we still have April, May, and June of utility bills to be processed.

2275
03:56:50,830 --> 03:57:00,698
[SPEAKER_19]: So we do, again, maintain an encumbrance to accommodate the anticipated invoices that will come through the end of June.

2276
03:57:00,718 --> 03:57:01,438
[SPEAKER_19]: Again,

2277
03:57:02,780 --> 03:57:04,200
[SPEAKER_19]: best estimate at this point.

2278
03:57:04,280 --> 03:57:11,663
[SPEAKER_19]: We do not know what those actuals will be, so we are keeping those encumbrances in place right now.

2279
03:57:14,764 --> 03:57:26,367
[SPEAKER_19]: So our year-to-date expense, again, is trending slightly higher than our midpoint last year, about $47,949 higher, and we will likely expend the full budget amount in our electricity line.

2280
03:57:27,387 --> 03:57:42,663
[SPEAKER_19]: Again, the city and schools are in communication and cooperation trying to identify other energy improvements that will continue to help maintain and hopefully reduce some costs with other projects in line.

2281
03:57:43,758 --> 03:57:55,785
[SPEAKER_19]: So in summary, we are working very hard to contain the costs for this year with all of the unexpected items that have occurred and minimize the year-end purchases to offset some of those identified challenges.

2282
03:57:56,806 --> 03:58:12,195
[SPEAKER_19]: As we prepare for the 18-19 budget, it's imperative that we recognize the increases in some of the major categories and prioritize with the anticipation of collective bargaining settlements, our continued investment in security and transportation, as well as all the variable costs.

2283
03:58:12,710 --> 03:58:23,093
[SPEAKER_19]: such as the staffing needs that we've heard about that are so important, utilities that are going to hit, and all of the other important areas for our budget.

2284
03:58:23,233 --> 03:58:23,974
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you very much.

2285
03:58:24,534 --> 03:58:27,595
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Benedetto.

2286
03:58:27,755 --> 03:58:28,135
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2287
03:58:28,495 --> 03:58:29,435
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you for your report.

2288
03:58:30,756 --> 03:58:36,998
[SPEAKER_22]: Do you happen to have a breakdown of the additional security costs since we added the dual monitors?

2289
03:58:38,033 --> 03:58:43,799
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, as you can see, the overtime is roughly $30,000 between the two line items.

2290
03:58:46,101 --> 03:58:58,153
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's just in this line item, so we do have other overtime costs that are in other program areas, such as community schools and other areas as well that have door coverage.

2291
03:58:58,950 --> 03:59:04,433
[SPEAKER_22]: I was just wondering what the total cost was that, and I don't know how difficult that'd be for you to get to us.

2292
03:59:04,633 --> 03:59:11,177
[SPEAKER_22]: Just an idea so that we can use that figure to pre-plan for next year, if that's the route that we're gonna go.

2293
03:59:11,197 --> 03:59:12,478
[SPEAKER_22]: It would be helpful.

2294
03:59:13,498 --> 03:59:16,380
[SPEAKER_22]: Also, could you provide us a copy of the last audit?

2295
03:59:16,480 --> 03:59:22,683
[SPEAKER_22]: I know it was requested at one of our... It is just being finalized right now.

2296
03:59:22,944 --> 03:59:23,144
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

2297
03:59:23,164 --> 03:59:26,145
[SPEAKER_19]: So it hasn't been held, it just hasn't been completed.

2298
03:59:26,465 --> 03:59:26,906
[SPEAKER_19]: Perfect.

2299
03:59:27,814 --> 03:59:28,154
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

2300
03:59:28,414 --> 03:59:31,656
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, so can we have that on the requested reports list, please?

2301
03:59:31,816 --> 03:59:36,419
[SPEAKER_22]: The, um, a copy of the audit, the last financial audit.

2302
03:59:37,580 --> 03:59:37,800
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

2303
03:59:38,300 --> 03:59:45,925
[SPEAKER_22]: And, um, while we were talking about security, it brought up a question that is really not for you, um, miss Patterson.

2304
03:59:45,965 --> 03:59:46,485
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you though.

2305
03:59:46,966 --> 03:59:48,086
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, it's for the mayor.

2306
03:59:48,186 --> 03:59:55,631
[SPEAKER_22]: Could she please, could you please, with all respect, give us an update on the report from the Martha Coakley law firm.

2307
03:59:56,160 --> 04:00:00,623
[SPEAKER_24]: We have not received the report from Foley-Hoag, Martha Coakley's report.

2308
04:00:01,504 --> 04:00:07,569
[SPEAKER_24]: It obviously, the police report came in much later than we anticipated, so she wanted to make sure she had that information.

2309
04:00:08,209 --> 04:00:10,331
[SPEAKER_24]: So we are hopeful that we will have it in the next week.

2310
04:00:12,252 --> 04:00:12,412
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

2311
04:00:12,612 --> 04:00:21,239
[SPEAKER_22]: And a follow-up, it's not so much a financial follow-up, but a few more reports that were requested that weren't on the requester reports list.

2312
04:00:21,259 --> 04:00:25,562
[SPEAKER_22]: So while I was talking about it, I thought I'd bring it up to Mr. Belson.

2313
04:00:26,423 --> 04:00:36,725
[SPEAKER_22]: A report on the traffic pattern at the pool door so that way we can make determinations if we're moving that person at nine o'clock in the morning down to the vocational school.

2314
04:00:37,505 --> 04:00:40,126
[SPEAKER_22]: Could you add that to the list so that can be provided to us?

2315
04:00:40,966 --> 04:00:42,166
[SPEAKER_22]: It's just a tally, really.

2316
04:00:43,406 --> 04:00:46,567
[SPEAKER_22]: The community school usage I just received now.

2317
04:00:47,727 --> 04:00:48,608
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'll look at that.

2318
04:00:49,168 --> 04:00:50,248
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, we got this tonight.

2319
04:00:50,728 --> 04:00:53,869
[SPEAKER_22]: This has all the rentals for the community schools for the year, I believe.

2320
04:00:54,029 --> 04:00:55,729
[SPEAKER_22]: Is that what this report is?

2321
04:00:58,095 --> 04:01:01,516
[SPEAKER_19]: That's rentals and just general usage of the building.

2322
04:01:01,836 --> 04:01:07,218
[SPEAKER_19]: And again, there was no ill intent of not providing that.

2323
04:01:07,238 --> 04:01:11,760
[SPEAKER_19]: It was this sheer volume of not being able to, and we utilized our graphics department.

2324
04:01:11,780 --> 04:01:13,260
[SPEAKER_22]: No, I appreciate you having it.

2325
04:01:13,300 --> 04:01:17,202
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm gonna look at it, and if I have any questions, I'll bring them up at our next meeting.

2326
04:01:17,602 --> 04:01:25,085
[SPEAKER_22]: I just wanted to say thank you for providing that for us, and I know the financial report on that is coming up next.

2327
04:01:27,352 --> 04:01:38,199
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. Belson's report on the cost analyst feasibility study for the items suggested on the building and grounds meeting, that report is not listed here.

2328
04:01:40,200 --> 04:01:50,666
[SPEAKER_22]: Remember, Roy, you were talking about giving us a feasibility study and prices for the buildings and grounds items that were suggested.

2329
04:01:54,982 --> 04:01:57,363
[SPEAKER_24]: He's having trouble understanding.

2330
04:01:57,523 --> 04:02:00,425
[SPEAKER_24]: You want something, can you write down the reports that you believe are missing?

2331
04:02:00,725 --> 04:02:00,885
[SPEAKER_22]: Yep.

2332
04:02:01,205 --> 04:02:04,886
[SPEAKER_24]: Instead, then submit it, just email him tomorrow and he can look them over.

2333
04:02:05,146 --> 04:02:07,787
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, and I just want to announce them so everybody knows as well.

2334
04:02:08,147 --> 04:02:18,191
[SPEAKER_22]: In requested number of bullying reports completed by school, that was requested by someone I noticed in the minutes that wasn't added to the list.

2335
04:02:19,172 --> 04:02:21,813
[SPEAKER_22]: Bullying reports.

2336
04:02:21,833 --> 04:02:22,833
[SPEAKER_22]: The number by school.

2337
04:02:23,558 --> 04:02:29,360
[SPEAKER_22]: And again, the list of retirements coming forward, so that way we have that data as well.

2338
04:02:33,082 --> 04:02:33,482
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

2339
04:02:33,682 --> 04:02:42,486
[SPEAKER_22]: I really appreciate the report you provided to us on the finance budget and the time that your department took to present this to us.

2340
04:02:42,706 --> 04:02:43,106
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

2341
04:02:44,947 --> 04:02:47,127
[SPEAKER_22]: Motion to approve report and place on file.

2342
04:02:47,147 --> 04:02:48,388
[SPEAKER_24]: Motion to accept this report.

2343
04:02:49,328 --> 04:02:50,289
[SPEAKER_24]: Place it on file, Ms.

2344
04:02:50,309 --> 04:02:50,629
[SPEAKER_24]: Ruggiero.

2345
04:02:51,307 --> 04:02:52,407
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I just have two questions.

2346
04:02:52,447 --> 04:02:53,888
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much for putting this together.

2347
04:02:54,608 --> 04:02:58,809
[SPEAKER_10]: On page one of 13, this is of the financial year budget expenditure.

2348
04:02:59,649 --> 04:03:03,811
[SPEAKER_10]: Could you just explain what errors and omissions, what that line item is?

2349
04:03:03,851 --> 04:03:06,831
[SPEAKER_22]: That's insurance coverage for the school district.

2350
04:03:07,111 --> 04:03:07,732
[SPEAKER_10]: I see, I see.

2351
04:03:07,772 --> 04:03:10,152
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, thank you just for clarifying that for my brain.

2352
04:03:10,172 --> 04:03:11,973
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm a little sleepy right now.

2353
04:03:11,993 --> 04:03:19,355
[SPEAKER_10]: And also, on page two of 13, I had a question about the photocopy lease and purchase.

2354
04:03:19,997 --> 04:03:27,364
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, that was a renewal of the leases throughout the district, and there was a slight increase.

2355
04:03:27,444 --> 04:03:35,371
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a contractual increase, so there are two payment installments left, roughly $11,000 each, so the encumbrance stands correct at $22,000.

2356
04:03:35,451 --> 04:03:35,711
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

2357
04:03:39,550 --> 04:03:42,891
[SPEAKER_24]: There's a motion on the floor to accept this report and place it on file.

2358
04:03:42,911 --> 04:03:45,272
[SPEAKER_24]: Is there a second by Mr. Russo?

2359
04:03:45,472 --> 04:03:45,672
[SPEAKER_24]: Ms.

2360
04:03:45,812 --> 04:03:46,892
[SPEAKER_24]: Van der Kloot, did you have a question?

2361
04:03:47,153 --> 04:03:49,693
[SPEAKER_14]: I just wanted to thank you for staying so long tonight.

2362
04:03:49,993 --> 04:03:52,594
[SPEAKER_14]: I know it's a long drive home too, so I really appreciate it.

2363
04:03:53,334 --> 04:03:55,095
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll be getting breakfast on my way home.

2364
04:03:55,295 --> 04:03:55,995
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

2365
04:03:56,035 --> 04:03:56,515
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Kirsten.

2366
04:04:00,028 --> 04:04:04,071
[SPEAKER_24]: We also have up next is the financial report on community schools programs.

2367
04:04:04,531 --> 04:04:04,751
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

2368
04:04:05,012 --> 04:04:11,917
[SPEAKER_19]: So again, this is a recap of the activity that has occurred to date.

2369
04:04:12,077 --> 04:04:14,799
[SPEAKER_19]: Again, it's important to understand.

2370
04:04:14,839 --> 04:04:27,188
[SPEAKER_19]: I gave this a little bit more of a learning curve for some of the new members just so that you understood how the revolving accounts and which community schools falls under is handled.

2371
04:04:27,987 --> 04:04:39,870
[SPEAKER_19]: So again, your packet included the community schools programming, which you received a large packet this evening for all the dates and times and locations of everything throughout the school year.

2372
04:04:40,870 --> 04:04:49,672
[SPEAKER_19]: You also received the program documents for the rentals, the athletic revolving, the Conti rink, Edgerly Field, and the swimming pool.

2373
04:04:50,532 --> 04:04:54,733
[SPEAKER_19]: So again, the program managers have provided summaries of all of their

2374
04:04:56,039 --> 04:05:17,180
[SPEAKER_19]: recorded revenues, expenditures, and as I went through and did what you could call a pseudo-internal audit, they do a very good job, a thorough job of keeping their records and knowing what is out there and what hasn't been posted at the hall with regard to some of their physical deposits and or things that are in transit.

2375
04:05:19,228 --> 04:05:21,370
[SPEAKER_19]: a good handle on what the activity is.

2376
04:05:22,250 --> 04:05:30,556
[SPEAKER_19]: So also provided is the, again, the large packet is from our facility scheduler.

2377
04:05:30,676 --> 04:05:35,920
[SPEAKER_19]: It's an online product that is maintained by Rachel Perry.

2378
04:05:35,940 --> 04:05:37,201
[SPEAKER_19]: That's a huge undertaking.

2379
04:05:37,301 --> 04:05:46,067
[SPEAKER_19]: So as you can imagine, all of these items had to be hand-keyed by each school and each activity level.

2380
04:05:46,187 --> 04:05:47,628
[SPEAKER_19]: So there's a significant amount

2381
04:05:48,348 --> 04:05:53,613
[SPEAKER_19]: maintenance that goes into these and oversight for all of these programs under community schools.

2382
04:05:55,114 --> 04:05:57,977
[SPEAKER_19]: So these community schools are revolving accounts.

2383
04:05:58,037 --> 04:06:03,562
[SPEAKER_19]: They have continuous activity, which rolls over year after year with any applicable fund balance.

2384
04:06:04,083 --> 04:06:13,492
[SPEAKER_19]: Again, their mass general law intent is a self-supporting program, should have receipts and revenues to cover the related expenses.

2385
04:06:14,310 --> 04:06:20,672
[SPEAKER_19]: And as a cost structure for nonprofit entities, it's considered a break-even model, if you will.

2386
04:06:20,772 --> 04:06:24,434
[SPEAKER_19]: So your activities should support what you need to pay out.

2387
04:06:24,814 --> 04:06:31,396
[SPEAKER_19]: However, there are unexpected issues that occur within a program area, just as there are within a general budget.

2388
04:06:31,876 --> 04:06:38,999
[SPEAKER_19]: So there were some significant areas that had some high levels of maintenance and things of that sort.

2389
04:06:40,650 --> 04:06:52,755
[SPEAKER_19]: So the intent of the program, again, is to provide services to the greater Medford community, engaging with parents, staff, and outside organizations to facilitate partnerships between the schools and our constituents.

2390
04:06:53,135 --> 04:07:02,379
[SPEAKER_19]: So again, as we think of community schools, we think of the engagement with our parents, our community leaders, and the like.

2391
04:07:03,634 --> 04:07:12,579
[SPEAKER_19]: So as we go through the additional by category, we first have the edgerly fields, and that's program number 321.

2392
04:07:13,479 --> 04:07:17,521
[SPEAKER_19]: And the account purpose is to collect rental fees for the use of the fields.

2393
04:07:18,542 --> 04:07:29,208
[SPEAKER_19]: There was a major renovation project for this, and so there is bond and interest payments that is automatically charged and absorbed.

2394
04:07:29,288 --> 04:07:30,288
[SPEAKER_19]: And for this year, it was 90,500.

2395
04:07:32,217 --> 04:07:40,881
[SPEAKER_19]: So against our operating receipts and expenditures, that program also absorbed that additional component.

2396
04:07:41,662 --> 04:07:54,908
[SPEAKER_19]: But we have a balance in that account, roughly 43,000, and the spring is a very active rental season, so we anticipate additional expected growth in that fund balance for year-end through June.

2397
04:07:55,989 --> 04:07:57,649
[SPEAKER_19]: Our athletic revolving program is 361.

2398
04:07:59,406 --> 04:08:06,848
[SPEAKER_19]: Again, the account purpose for this program is for sport user fees and gate fees for all the various fall, winter, and spring sports.

2399
04:08:07,328 --> 04:08:18,812
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it's important and noteworthy to identify that the athletic programs on both the general budget and the revolving account are significantly underfunded at this point in time.

2400
04:08:18,892 --> 04:08:29,035
[SPEAKER_19]: We are in a new MIAA league, and there are significant costs that go with that, including transportation that takes us further up and down

2401
04:08:29,783 --> 04:08:35,448
[SPEAKER_19]: the coast where the league that we used to be in was right in our backyard, Malden, Medford, and the like.

2402
04:08:35,609 --> 04:08:39,412
[SPEAKER_19]: So we have some significant costs with the new league.

2403
04:08:39,432 --> 04:08:42,475
[SPEAKER_19]: We also have additional coaching.

2404
04:08:42,535 --> 04:08:45,258
[SPEAKER_19]: We have additional officials expense.

2405
04:08:45,678 --> 04:08:50,843
[SPEAKER_19]: So this is a program area that struggles to sustain itself, so I think it's important

2406
04:08:51,617 --> 04:08:52,378
[SPEAKER_19]: understand that.

2407
04:08:53,619 --> 04:09:03,987
[SPEAKER_19]: While it currently shows an $8,000 deficit, many of the spring user fees have not yet been collected, and it's anticipated that we will break even at the year end.

2408
04:09:05,168 --> 04:09:17,978
[SPEAKER_19]: Again, we are part of the Northeast Conference with 16 schools that go up the North Shore as far as Gloucester, and it has created additional burdens on our regular athletic accounts and impacts the revolving fund due to

2409
04:09:19,066 --> 04:09:21,787
[SPEAKER_19]: some low home team attendance for gate receipts and the like.

2410
04:09:23,587 --> 04:09:39,630
[SPEAKER_19]: So moving forward into our community schools, the community schools is the revolving program 362, which its account purpose is to collect rental fees for use of facilities at all buildings, the high school and all of the outside schools.

2411
04:09:40,470 --> 04:09:45,311
[SPEAKER_19]: While this program shows a deficit of roughly $29,778, we have many annual rental fees

2412
04:09:48,288 --> 04:10:02,557
[SPEAKER_19]: that have not been collected, such as our AIC rental here at the high school, Tibetans, a new renter for the Redemption Church, as well as some summer camp deposits that we would anticipate a break-even status for year-end.

2413
04:10:03,518 --> 04:10:14,185
[SPEAKER_19]: Our community schools engage many participants, ranging from the Japanese language school, some not-for-profit recreation groups, independent functions and the like that truly enhance the community involvement.

2414
04:10:14,700 --> 04:10:24,423
[SPEAKER_19]: And I would guess that in your interactions with your constituents that they always have good things to say about the extracurricular events that take place at all of our buildings.

2415
04:10:24,523 --> 04:10:30,085
[SPEAKER_19]: And this is where those funds are received and the expenses are taken out.

2416
04:10:30,145 --> 04:10:35,906
[SPEAKER_19]: And that includes for the summer fun camp and the vacation camps as well.

2417
04:10:37,607 --> 04:10:44,389
[SPEAKER_19]: The Loconte Rink is a revolving program 365 whose account purpose collects the rental fees for the use of the ice rink.

2418
04:10:45,419 --> 04:10:47,400
[SPEAKER_19]: The rink shows a fund deficit of $79,000.

2419
04:10:48,041 --> 04:10:57,888
[SPEAKER_19]: However, we do have revenues that are outstanding, totaling $73,600 that will bring the program toward a break-even status at year end.

2420
04:10:58,488 --> 04:11:03,332
[SPEAKER_19]: Again, this is a difficult area to project out and maintain.

2421
04:11:03,352 --> 04:11:12,458
[SPEAKER_19]: There's a significant amount of maintenance that goes into this facility with the ice and utilities that it costs to run and keep the facility cold.

2422
04:11:13,243 --> 04:11:17,206
[SPEAKER_19]: So there are significant costs that will impact that program area.

2423
04:11:18,467 --> 04:11:27,595
[SPEAKER_19]: The swimming pool is program 631, whose purpose is for the use of the pool by community groups, individuals, and the like.

2424
04:11:28,656 --> 04:11:40,606
[SPEAKER_19]: The pool has sustained significant unpredictable charges this year, including $13,000 for the lane and motor repairs, as well as a spike in the custodial overtime due to the

2425
04:11:41,802 --> 04:11:43,583
[SPEAKER_19]: unexpected security component.

2426
04:11:44,223 --> 04:11:59,870
[SPEAKER_19]: So the pool shows an approximate deficit of 44,000, but we do have 8,800 in physical deposits that are in transit that we are researching with the hall, and we do have the spring months coming up that do provide more pool activity.

2427
04:12:00,750 --> 04:12:07,113
[SPEAKER_19]: People see the sunshine, they get excited, they want to swim, they want to use the pool for upcoming birthday parties and the like.

2428
04:12:08,945 --> 04:12:33,595
[SPEAKER_19]: So it is also noteworthy that the pool, when it was brought back online, that it may not generate the highest level of revenue, but it is an important offering to the community recreation department, and there's substantial use during the open swim hours, and I think that's important to share that you do have people from the community using the pool during those additional hours.

2429
04:12:35,197 --> 04:12:45,485
[SPEAKER_19]: So from the words of our committee member, DiBenedetto, it's not necessarily what we want to hear, but this is the truth here this evening on the community schools.

2430
04:12:45,585 --> 04:12:54,832
[SPEAKER_19]: So we are going in with our best foot forward and collect everything that we possibly can and hope to break even on all of these accounts.

2431
04:12:58,595 --> 04:12:58,995
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

2432
04:13:01,237 --> 04:13:04,900
[SPEAKER_22]: So I went by each item.

2433
04:13:05,705 --> 04:13:08,007
[SPEAKER_22]: I found it easy to do it that way.

2434
04:13:08,408 --> 04:13:16,335
[SPEAKER_22]: So with Edgerly Field, I took the total deposits of $142,374.50, and then the expenses that were listed were $162,916, which means a difference of $20,000, a little bit more, in the red.

2435
04:13:33,540 --> 04:13:35,902
[SPEAKER_22]: but we had money in the account prior to that, right?

2436
04:13:36,302 --> 04:13:38,364
[SPEAKER_22]: So we're not really in the red in that thing.

2437
04:13:38,804 --> 04:13:42,967
[SPEAKER_22]: Does that include the bond and the insurance?

2438
04:13:43,588 --> 04:13:45,149
[SPEAKER_22]: Because I know- The bond and the interest, yes.

2439
04:13:45,169 --> 04:13:46,210
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, that includes everything.

2440
04:13:46,230 --> 04:13:46,630
[SPEAKER_19]: The 90,000, yes.

2441
04:13:46,710 --> 04:13:52,415
[SPEAKER_22]: I know a few years ago we got into a little trouble with that and the city helped us out and I'm glad to see that added in.

2442
04:13:52,515 --> 04:13:52,715
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

2443
04:13:52,815 --> 04:13:54,156
[SPEAKER_22]: I just want to say thank you for that.

2444
04:13:56,178 --> 04:14:02,903
[SPEAKER_22]: I just want to make sure that the revenue coming in, that we're really having everybody pay for all the things.

2445
04:14:04,267 --> 04:14:10,951
[SPEAKER_22]: I'd also like to see the personnel in the payroll issues listed when we get these reports.

2446
04:14:12,391 --> 04:14:16,133
[SPEAKER_22]: I know that's a lot and I don't know if that's easy to do or not easy to do.

2447
04:14:17,934 --> 04:14:20,275
[SPEAKER_22]: And I got the usage, that was my other note.

2448
04:14:20,916 --> 04:14:27,159
[SPEAKER_22]: You provided us with the usage of who's on Edgeley Field as well as any buildings, right?

2449
04:14:27,419 --> 04:14:27,799
[SPEAKER_22]: Correct.

2450
04:14:27,999 --> 04:14:28,239
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

2451
04:14:30,783 --> 04:14:38,927
[SPEAKER_22]: And you know what I really was hoping to see in part of this is donations of use time on our fields.

2452
04:14:39,127 --> 04:14:52,614
[SPEAKER_22]: Like a list of people in the community, we donate time on the fields, on our buildings, because that's a PR thing, like we care about the community, we donate.

2453
04:14:52,774 --> 04:14:59,697
[SPEAKER_22]: I know Mr. Maloney definitely provides many people in our community time,

2454
04:15:00,057 --> 04:15:05,661
[SPEAKER_22]: to use our facilities and donated, and that was part of the computer program that I had hoped we would get that.

2455
04:15:06,021 --> 04:15:06,882
[SPEAKER_22]: And maybe that's in that.

2456
04:15:06,942 --> 04:15:08,843
[SPEAKER_22]: I just haven't had a chance tonight.

2457
04:15:08,883 --> 04:15:11,385
[SPEAKER_22]: There's been so many goings on to read this.

2458
04:15:12,066 --> 04:15:20,892
[SPEAKER_22]: So maybe someone could clarify that for me if that's in this or how that's being tracked, because that was requested a couple times throughout the years.

2459
04:15:21,717 --> 04:15:30,964
[SPEAKER_19]: If I can respond, as we reviewed all of the data and information, I did not come across a significant amount of donated time.

2460
04:15:31,345 --> 04:15:33,406
[SPEAKER_19]: As you can see, the schedule is quite booked.

2461
04:15:33,887 --> 04:15:41,833
[SPEAKER_19]: So the majority of our usage is through a true facility rental and paid accordingly.

2462
04:15:42,293 --> 04:15:44,835
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

2463
04:15:45,136 --> 04:15:50,600
[SPEAKER_22]: Just in general in the future, I mean, people tell me all the time about different things going on

2464
04:15:52,004 --> 04:15:57,506
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't see some of those things listed, so that's why I thought they were more of donation.

2465
04:15:57,846 --> 04:16:01,007
[SPEAKER_22]: So we can move on to the athletic revenue expenses.

2466
04:16:01,907 --> 04:16:09,610
[SPEAKER_22]: So I just wanted to be forthright and clear, the income for the athletics department was $81,974.25, and the expenses were $93,044.78, so the difference there is $11,000

2467
04:16:20,969 --> 04:16:26,155
[SPEAKER_22]: but that's not the end of the year, like you said, the gate things.

2468
04:16:26,636 --> 04:16:39,972
[SPEAKER_22]: And as far as employees for the athletics department, they're usually under the school employee people and not generally listed under athletics in this capacity.

2469
04:16:40,259 --> 04:16:43,780
[SPEAKER_19]: Right, for coaching and the like, those are a budgeted item.

2470
04:16:43,840 --> 04:16:46,820
[SPEAKER_22]: Right, just getting through it all.

2471
04:16:47,240 --> 04:16:48,501
[SPEAKER_22]: And then community schools.

2472
04:16:48,981 --> 04:16:51,541
[SPEAKER_22]: So this is the biggest amounts.

2473
04:16:54,662 --> 04:17:09,025
[SPEAKER_22]: So my first question is AIC, Japanese schools, the church, those ones that you listed, we don't know what those amounts are, and we also don't know when those payments are coming in.

2474
04:17:09,440 --> 04:17:11,181
[SPEAKER_22]: Could you provide us some of the information?

2475
04:17:11,261 --> 04:17:13,443
[SPEAKER_19]: They had not been issued as of this time.

2476
04:17:13,503 --> 04:17:21,368
[SPEAKER_19]: Again, as indicated, they're an annual rental invoice, so those are just being produced and going out shortly.

2477
04:17:21,388 --> 04:17:33,216
[SPEAKER_22]: Do you mind just telling us an update as those go out, so just like when they went out, how much they're being charged, and how that affects their budget.

2478
04:17:33,456 --> 04:17:35,538
[SPEAKER_22]: Also, the community school's income is 201,146.41,

2479
04:17:39,120 --> 04:17:44,362
[SPEAKER_22]: The expenses here are only $18,310.08, if I did my numbers right.

2480
04:17:45,383 --> 04:17:52,226
[SPEAKER_22]: So the total income is $191,836, is that correct?

2481
04:17:53,107 --> 04:17:57,148
[SPEAKER_19]: The item that's not listed for community schools expense is their payroll.

2482
04:17:59,049 --> 04:18:01,150
[SPEAKER_19]: So that would be an additional component.

2483
04:18:01,551 --> 04:18:03,011
[SPEAKER_22]: That does not include the payroll?

2484
04:18:03,271 --> 04:18:03,431
[SPEAKER_22]: No.

2485
04:18:04,352 --> 04:18:04,552
[SPEAKER_22]: All right.

2486
04:18:05,258 --> 04:18:08,260
[SPEAKER_22]: Could we get that number when we get the updated list of people?

2487
04:18:08,440 --> 04:18:09,281
[SPEAKER_22]: That would be helpful.

2488
04:18:09,481 --> 04:18:12,623
[SPEAKER_22]: And maybe just add it to this so we see it all at one time.

2489
04:18:13,103 --> 04:18:13,704
[SPEAKER_22]: That would be great.

2490
04:18:14,784 --> 04:18:15,865
[SPEAKER_22]: Moving forward.

2491
04:18:20,308 --> 04:18:32,456
[SPEAKER_22]: I also thought that there was a theater group that was using the high school theater at the same time that the high school musical was trying to be put on, because I think they rented it, or I don't know if it was donated,

2492
04:18:32,890 --> 04:18:37,273
[SPEAKER_22]: I think some of our other members' children were in that program, so I don't know the name of it.

2493
04:18:37,653 --> 04:18:42,116
[SPEAKER_22]: There was a theater group that was being, they were practicing up at the high school.

2494
04:18:42,657 --> 04:18:44,318
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. Belson, do you know about that?

2495
04:18:49,161 --> 04:18:51,062
[SPEAKER_22]: But their practices were at the same time.

2496
04:18:52,803 --> 04:18:53,884
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, okay.

2497
04:18:54,785 --> 04:18:58,527
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, there was some production up at the high school using the theater.

2498
04:19:01,569 --> 04:19:02,670
[SPEAKER_22]: Was it an Arlington group?

2499
04:19:06,211 --> 04:19:06,771
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, it wasn't.

2500
04:19:09,192 --> 04:19:20,955
[SPEAKER_22]: So there was an Arlington group that using the Karen Theater, and I'm assuming that they rented it out, and there were conflict in timing.

2501
04:19:24,715 --> 04:19:33,157
[SPEAKER_22]: We got an email about this, Mr. Maloney, about the high school kids when they were, a parent sent it to us.

2502
04:19:33,197 --> 04:19:34,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Bobby Maloney, 61 Sheridan Ave, Medford.

2503
04:19:36,036 --> 04:19:51,026
[SPEAKER_02]: I talked to an individual, I talked to Mayor, the way the little theater rental works, Tony Shashikni, Dr. Perella, Aaron Keith, Sarah Grant, they give us their dates they want, then we go to the public.

2504
04:19:51,846 --> 04:20:05,175
[SPEAKER_02]: What happened was, I believe, I think it was Sarah Grant, changed her dates, and the Islington group had the theater booked, so they already had a contract, they paid, and they paid handsomely, by the way.

2505
04:20:06,320 --> 04:20:14,703
[SPEAKER_02]: So I spoke to one of the parents at Method High School and I said, you can come into my office, you can look at the way we do the, and she was very happy with the phone call.

2506
04:20:15,523 --> 04:20:15,924
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, okay.

2507
04:20:16,024 --> 04:20:17,864
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you for reaching out to that parent.

2508
04:20:17,884 --> 04:20:18,545
[SPEAKER_22]: I appreciate it.

2509
04:20:19,065 --> 04:20:20,505
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, what Arlington group is that?

2510
04:20:20,525 --> 04:20:24,667
[SPEAKER_22]: Cause I don't see it listed as, um, on the community school rental.

2511
04:20:24,707 --> 04:20:26,307
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be happy to email you in the morning.

2512
04:20:27,308 --> 04:20:27,548
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

2513
04:20:33,315 --> 04:20:36,677
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to say it was the troublemakers.

2514
04:20:37,837 --> 04:20:38,477
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a play.

2515
04:20:39,658 --> 04:20:43,119
[SPEAKER_02]: I can get you the information in a moment.

2516
04:20:44,780 --> 04:20:45,060
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

2517
04:20:46,521 --> 04:20:47,941
[SPEAKER_22]: I'd appreciate that very much.

2518
04:20:48,021 --> 04:20:48,421
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

2519
04:20:48,602 --> 04:20:55,044
[SPEAKER_22]: And so with what was presented, there is the $191,836 in this area, and other than the personnel.

2520
04:21:02,228 --> 04:21:02,788
[SPEAKER_22]: personnel.

2521
04:21:03,449 --> 04:21:04,410
[SPEAKER_22]: We'll come back to it.

2522
04:21:04,750 --> 04:21:05,771
[SPEAKER_22]: We'll come back to this.

2523
04:21:06,872 --> 04:21:10,975
[SPEAKER_22]: We'll just table it until we get that additional information.

2524
04:21:11,676 --> 04:21:12,797
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm almost done, sorry.

2525
04:21:14,939 --> 04:21:16,820
[SPEAKER_22]: The La Conte rank, the income is $157,600.

2526
04:21:17,341 --> 04:21:18,822
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm having trouble reading my writing this late.

2527
04:21:18,842 --> 04:21:19,923
[SPEAKER_22]: And the expenses are $227,049.63 with

2528
04:21:32,595 --> 04:21:33,175
[SPEAKER_22]: a difference of $69,449.

2529
04:21:33,756 --> 04:21:40,859
[SPEAKER_22]: I know that this is a benefit to have a rink in our community.

2530
04:21:43,060 --> 04:21:55,385
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know if we can advertise more rink time or how we can help change that deficit, and maybe it will change by the end of this 17?

2531
04:21:55,425 --> 04:21:58,367
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

2532
04:22:00,348 --> 04:22:00,828
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, great.

2533
04:22:01,738 --> 04:22:06,959
[SPEAKER_22]: And the last one is the pool, which is income of $149,025.50 and expenses of $173,657 with a difference of $24,600.

2534
04:22:07,059 --> 04:22:10,040
[SPEAKER_22]: And I don't think that's terrible considering all the extra security over time.

2535
04:22:10,080 --> 04:22:11,220
[SPEAKER_22]: Was that allocated to the pool?

2536
04:22:11,240 --> 04:22:11,360
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

2537
04:22:28,488 --> 04:22:35,690
[SPEAKER_22]: So I think that's pretty good because we knew when we opened those pools that it was going to be a tight thing because of the cost of running a pool.

2538
04:22:36,251 --> 04:22:43,073
[SPEAKER_22]: So, and I think it's a value to our students and to the community, well worth the investment.

2539
04:22:43,513 --> 04:22:46,374
[SPEAKER_22]: I just want to thank you for providing me with these reports.

2540
04:22:46,774 --> 04:22:50,255
[SPEAKER_22]: And if you could follow up with those few questions, I'd appreciate it.

2541
04:22:50,795 --> 04:22:54,177
[SPEAKER_22]: And thank you for staying so late to answer some of these questions.

2542
04:22:54,317 --> 04:22:55,477
[SPEAKER_22]: I really do appreciate it.

2543
04:22:56,478 --> 04:22:58,840
[SPEAKER_22]: having a good understanding of this area.

2544
04:22:59,220 --> 04:23:02,343
[SPEAKER_22]: So any extra money, how is that allocated?

2545
04:23:02,403 --> 04:23:03,163
[SPEAKER_22]: Where does it go to?

2546
04:23:03,183 --> 04:23:05,826
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

2547
04:23:07,167 --> 04:23:10,589
[SPEAKER_22]: So do we have a balance in that account?

2548
04:23:11,510 --> 04:23:13,071
[SPEAKER_19]: No, this is the report for you.

2549
04:23:13,111 --> 04:23:15,053
[SPEAKER_19]: These are the balances as of right now.

2550
04:23:15,673 --> 04:23:22,779
[SPEAKER_19]: We have two months remaining that we're hoping to maximize our collections and get to a break-even point.

2551
04:23:24,641 --> 04:23:24,821
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

2552
04:23:30,538 --> 04:23:31,119
[SPEAKER_14]: just real quick.

2553
04:23:31,299 --> 04:23:36,883
[SPEAKER_14]: On the annual rental fees, I guess it makes me a little nervous that we only collect them once a year.

2554
04:23:38,484 --> 04:23:42,647
[SPEAKER_14]: Can we insist that they be paid twice?

2555
04:23:44,969 --> 04:23:49,713
[SPEAKER_14]: Because if one of these goes out of business or something like that, we could really be left holding

2556
04:23:52,289 --> 04:24:02,715
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know how much each of these, AIC, Tibetans, Redemption Church, I don't know how much they pay us, but I'm just concerned that maybe going forward it would be a better idea to collect.

2557
04:24:03,396 --> 04:24:05,817
[SPEAKER_19]: Certainly, that's part of the review of the contracts.

2558
04:24:05,877 --> 04:24:12,742
[SPEAKER_19]: Again, this was in place, so following that protocol has been an annual invoice.

2559
04:24:12,962 --> 04:24:13,522
[SPEAKER_14]: When are they due?

2560
04:24:14,323 --> 04:24:14,723
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry?

2561
04:24:14,743 --> 04:24:15,644
[SPEAKER_14]: When is the payment due?

2562
04:24:16,324 --> 04:24:17,125
[SPEAKER_19]: Before the end of June.

2563
04:24:18,308 --> 04:24:22,132
[SPEAKER_14]: It just makes me a little nervous.

2564
04:24:22,172 --> 04:24:35,424

2565
04:24:36,516 --> 04:24:43,219
[SPEAKER_19]: identified for the last couple of months because we're pre-billing in that respect for the last couple of months.

2566
04:24:43,239 --> 04:24:43,559
[SPEAKER_19]: Right.

2567
04:24:43,799 --> 04:24:55,945
[SPEAKER_13]: But I guess I'm just suggesting a twice a year collection as opposed to... Again, these were contracts in place, so I didn't have that option.

2568
04:24:56,205 --> 04:24:59,806

2569
04:25:00,046 --> 04:25:00,267
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

2570
04:25:00,347 --> 04:25:00,627
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

2571
04:25:10,033 --> 04:25:10,955
[SPEAKER_34]: Great, thank you.

2572
04:25:10,975 --> 04:25:14,400
[SPEAKER_34]: Great, thank you.

2573
04:25:52,036 --> 04:25:52,637
[SPEAKER_25]: We have a motion and a second.

2574
04:25:52,657 --> 04:25:53,238
[SPEAKER_25]: We have a motion and a second.

2575
04:25:53,258 --> 04:25:53,838
[SPEAKER_25]: We have a motion and a second.

2576
04:25:53,858 --> 04:25:54,439
[SPEAKER_25]: We have a motion and a second.
