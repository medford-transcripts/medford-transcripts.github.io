1
00:00:00,297 --> 00:00:01,038
Good evening, everyone.

2
00:00:01,138 --> 00:00:01,878
Can you hear me all right.

3
00:00:01,898 --> 00:00:03,179
I can hear.

4
00:00:03,299 --> 00:00:04,801
That's right.

5
00:00:05,301 --> 00:00:05,521
Right.

6
00:00:05,922 --> 00:00:06,282
Hey, thanks.

7
00:00:06,422 --> 00:00:07,803
Thanks everybody for joining us.

8
00:00:08,964 --> 00:00:11,466
I'm just gonna make sure that we don't have anybody else in the waiting room here.

9
00:00:11,486 --> 00:00:11,526
So,

10
00:00:15,062 --> 00:00:16,002
My name is Adam Bardosky.

11
00:00:16,022 --> 00:00:17,303
I'm the attorney for the project.

12
00:00:17,343 --> 00:00:25,304
We're here tonight to talk about Salem Place, which is a proposed development at 290 Salem Street.

13
00:00:25,905 --> 00:00:33,907
With us tonight from the architectural team is Jacob Levine and Nyree Stewart, as well as the developers, Fernando Bento and Sal Parisio.

14
00:00:34,647 --> 00:00:36,947
So at the outset, I'd like to thank you all for joining.

15
00:00:36,967 --> 00:00:40,448
It looks like we have about 20 something here.

16
00:00:41,188 --> 00:00:43,369
And I'd also like to thank the city

17
00:00:47,073 --> 00:00:48,134
in putting this together.

18
00:00:48,414 --> 00:00:51,015
Victor Schrader, I believe, is here somewhere.

19
00:00:51,035 --> 00:00:58,438
I'd like to say thanks to Victor for putting out a few calls and just kind of helping to facilitate this whole thing.

20
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:02,100
So this is gonna be, this is an exciting project.

21
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:07,882
We've been waiting to have an opportunity to talk with members of the community on this project for some time.

22
00:01:08,623 --> 00:01:11,264
This is really gonna be the first opportunity to see the project.

23
00:01:12,313 --> 00:01:14,274
There's been nothing filed with the City so far.

24
00:01:14,314 --> 00:01:28,879
We anticipate that we'll have this meeting and at minimum we'll have to go before Planning and Development for site plan review and likely then next to the Zoning Board of Appeals for the zoning relief that's needed on the project.

25
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:36,982
So we're really just here tonight to tell you a little bit about the project, what's in store, what it looks like, share some of the plans with you,

26
00:01:38,213 --> 00:01:51,385
This is a mixed use development so it's going to be, it's proposed to be three stories, nine units in total with parking and a commercial unit on the first floor, there will be residential units on the second and third floor and a roof deck.

27
00:01:53,161 --> 00:02:01,085
With that, I think I'm going to pass it to the architectural team to share their screen and walk through some of the actual plans.

28
00:02:01,525 --> 00:02:08,870
And we'll have an opportunity to have you folks ask questions and really stay as long as you'd like.

29
00:02:11,071 --> 00:02:12,872
So let me see.

30
00:02:12,892 --> 00:02:17,995
Now, is it going to be Jacob or Nyree that's going to walk through the plans here?

31
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,751
Good evening, everybody.

32
00:02:23,031 --> 00:02:28,736
It just says host disabled participants screen sharing right now.

33
00:02:28,796 --> 00:02:31,278
I'm gonna sorry, I'm a little new to the hosting.

34
00:02:31,298 --> 00:02:32,819
So I'm going to make you a host.

35
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:36,522
Yeah, for a moment, Jacob, let's see if you let's see if you can handle it.

36
00:02:36,582 --> 00:02:37,082
If I do that.

37
00:02:37,122 --> 00:02:37,482
All right.

38
00:02:39,884 --> 00:02:40,465
Now the hosts.

39
00:02:42,232 --> 00:02:42,932
Okay, everybody.

40
00:02:42,952 --> 00:02:46,093
So hopefully y'all can see my screen here.

41
00:02:46,193 --> 00:02:48,514
Good evening and thank you all for joining us.

42
00:02:49,074 --> 00:02:55,935
We're the architecture team myself Jacob Levine is the project lead, and I have by my side Nyree Stewart, the project architect.

43
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,456
We are representing SL Haas Group.

44
00:02:58,696 --> 00:03:01,197
We are a local firm here in Boston.

45
00:03:02,477 --> 00:03:05,962
So, I'm going to run you through some images of the project.

46
00:03:06,002 --> 00:03:16,817
This is obviously the new building on the left right here, just a little rendering, showing our new proposed design, looking down Salem Street with Park Street on the left.

47
00:03:17,909 --> 00:03:26,636
we can come back and view some of these images as soon as we kind of run through some of the numbers on them so everyone can understand what we're trying to achieve with the floor plans themselves.

48
00:03:27,296 --> 00:03:32,740
So right now we're looking at a unit with two bedroom units.

49
00:03:33,241 --> 00:03:40,106
It's a need for it's important to have a mix of one beds and two bedrooms.

50
00:03:41,767 --> 00:03:52,238
So in total, our building is 3000 square feet of square footage on the first floor here on the left, you can see Salem Street is on this side down here.

51
00:03:52,718 --> 00:03:57,103
So we would propose about 1400 square feet of commercial space on this first floor.

52
00:03:57,703 --> 00:04:04,584
That would be an excellent opportunity to activate this corner on Park Street and Salem Street, give that space back to the town.

53
00:04:05,924 --> 00:04:08,785
In the back, we want to do parking off Park Street.

54
00:04:09,645 --> 00:04:14,326
Right now, we're showing eight parking spots, but we're going to try to get nine parking spots.

55
00:04:14,366 --> 00:04:15,606
That would be one per unit.

56
00:04:15,966 --> 00:04:21,087
Depending on how the final structural system lays out, we're pretty confident we can get nine parking spots.

57
00:04:21,467 --> 00:04:24,028
But right now, we're just showing eight parking spots in the back.

58
00:04:25,928 --> 00:04:29,009
not pull in through Salem Street as that's the busier road.

59
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:33,331
We're going to have the parking come and go two-way parking from Park Street.

60
00:04:33,991 --> 00:04:45,275
You can enter the building if you are a resident from the back on one of these two entrances, one right here by bike storage and the other through these main doors in which you'd go up the stairs or an elevator.

61
00:04:45,595 --> 00:04:51,717
We have one unit on the first floor that would be either a one bed with an office or we can make it a two bed.

62
00:04:53,676 --> 00:04:59,338
Dumpsters will be on the right side back here for ease of access to get them in and out for trash.

63
00:05:00,418 --> 00:05:10,621
As we work our way up, we're going to have in total, we have three two beds and eight one beds in the whole project.

64
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:12,282
So what I'm outlining here

65
00:05:13,141 --> 00:05:15,926
you're going to have a central stair corridor as shown here.

66
00:05:15,987 --> 00:05:23,240
You come up through a hallway and you are going to have excellent views in all the units with plenty of natural light.

67
00:05:23,987 --> 00:05:37,194
We have a large two-bedroom unit, which is 1,500 square feet, with a balcony overlooking Salem Street and Park Street to activate that corner, along with a typical one-bedroom unit is totaling about 800 square feet.

68
00:05:37,794 --> 00:05:43,657
So the two-bedroom units are 1,500 square feet, and the one-bedroom units are about 800 square feet.

69
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:49,680
The floor plan duplicates on the third floor as you continue up the stairs with one common hallway.

70
00:05:50,872 --> 00:05:53,714
making everything structurally work accordingly.

71
00:05:53,834 --> 00:06:08,725
We're trying to work with some of these bump-outs to, if you go back to the rendering, capture the essence of this project, which is a great model example of classic architecture in Medford, using the bump-outs here.

72
00:06:09,685 --> 00:06:17,671
The color scheme at this point hasn't been finalized, but we wanna do something with a lot of detail, similar to the ornate style across the street.

73
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:23,003
As we work our way up to the last floor, we're proposing a roof deck for all the tenants.

74
00:06:23,663 --> 00:06:25,824
This roof space is still being developed.

75
00:06:26,484 --> 00:06:30,945
We think it would be a great opportunity to look over the street and add some activity to the roof.

76
00:06:31,486 --> 00:06:37,768
We would love to try to have sustainable features in our buildings, such as solar panels or maybe rainwater collectors in the back end.

77
00:06:40,464 --> 00:06:47,390
Lastly, I'm going to show you here, we're going to try to reuse some of the foundation of the existing facility, depending on the condition of it.

78
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:57,017
You would either put a gym or mechanical space back down in that basement, but trying to be sustainable and use as much of that foundation as possible and not dig more than we have to.

79
00:06:57,738 --> 00:07:00,981
On the right, you can see our proposed site plan.

80
00:07:02,562 --> 00:07:03,983
We can get into a little bit more detail.

81
00:07:06,294 --> 00:07:07,274
with the proposed building.

82
00:07:07,755 --> 00:07:24,980
The building gross square footage on all floors is 13,000 square feet, so it's broken down into 3,000 square feet on the first floor and 5,000 square feet on the second and 5,000 square feet on the third floor, outlined by this red ring you see here and this red ring you see here.

83
00:07:26,016 --> 00:07:27,338
Lastly, our elevations.

84
00:07:27,719 --> 00:07:36,394
It's a very tricky site when I say tricky, you can see the site plan here how it's a really hard angle, so they, it's

85
00:07:37,443 --> 00:07:40,084
very difficult to try to work with that angle.

86
00:07:40,104 --> 00:07:44,367
So the elevations might be a little bit confusing, but I'll try walking you guys through them.

87
00:07:44,887 --> 00:07:48,349
This would be what you would see from Salem Street side.

88
00:07:49,189 --> 00:07:52,951
So this would be the entrance to the commercial street down below.

89
00:07:52,971 --> 00:07:57,654
These would be the bump outs that we were showing to represent the bump outs across the street.

90
00:08:00,283 --> 00:08:03,765
This would be the view from the Park Street side of things.

91
00:08:03,845 --> 00:08:06,127
So this is where the parking would be, under here.

92
00:08:06,147 --> 00:08:08,308
So you would park actually under the building.

93
00:08:09,409 --> 00:08:13,692
And this would be a very beautiful facade to see from Park Street.

94
00:08:13,892 --> 00:08:17,715
Everything is balanced, equal with a lot of thought and detail that goes into it.

95
00:08:18,515 --> 00:08:23,859
And these are the other two, not as visible sides, but still have some character to them.

96
00:08:24,836 --> 00:08:30,743
And that is where we are at with the design right now as we're continuing to explore color options and materials.

97
00:08:31,204 --> 00:08:36,951
We certainly want to use some brickwork that tries to match the existing brickwork from across the street.

98
00:08:37,491 --> 00:08:41,876
We're trying to use, excuse me, sustainable and durable materials that will last.

99
00:08:42,497 --> 00:08:44,078
more so than just vinyl siding.

100
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:50,884
And we want to stay away from any sort of metal panels that was used down the street that has the really modern rustic look.

101
00:08:51,724 --> 00:08:57,769
So right now we're looking at maybe fiber cement board or something in the durable aspect, but that's still being decided.

102
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:03,053
So that is our presentation right now and the drawings as they stand.

103
00:09:05,915 --> 00:09:06,136
Great.

104
00:09:06,176 --> 00:09:06,776
Thanks, Jacob.

105
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,518
Adam, would you like me to make you host again?

106
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:10,379
Sure.

107
00:09:10,619 --> 00:09:10,939
Thank you.

108
00:09:16,521 --> 00:09:17,221
Thank you, everybody.

109
00:09:17,241 --> 00:09:25,025
I'm going to take my brother when I joined the is one of our partners to you want to join the meeting.

110
00:09:27,486 --> 00:09:28,306
If you can let him in.

111
00:09:29,046 --> 00:09:31,127
Sure, you can foster rental.

112
00:09:36,049 --> 00:09:38,770
That's an issue the computer so computer like.

113
00:09:39,831 --> 00:09:42,552
Alright, so everyone from the waiting room should be at this point.

114
00:09:46,432 --> 00:09:52,375
see if you show up.

115
00:09:52,435 --> 00:09:53,075
All right.

116
00:09:53,295 --> 00:09:58,658
Fernando, Sal, did you want to, I mean, that's essentially the presentation we had from the design side.

117
00:09:58,678 --> 00:10:02,780
Did you want to add anything before we start hearing from folks in the neighborhood?

118
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,021
This is Sal Caruso.

119
00:10:06,101 --> 00:10:08,182
I'm on the development team also, the developer.

120
00:10:08,943 --> 00:10:10,123
I mean, I want to thank Jacob.

121
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:13,725
Jacob did a great job in filtrating what we'd like to do there and

122
00:10:14,378 --> 00:10:21,182
try to make the building more of, not like the buildings, like you said, down the street with the panel, the metal panels and all that.

123
00:10:21,582 --> 00:10:35,850
We'd like to do is maybe some, you know, like siding, body plank siding along those lines and the brickwork and make it a little bit more appealing and not have to worry about one year or three years down the road and not start looking like the building's falling apart, because it is down the street.

124
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:39,832
But no, I think Jacob's done a great job in designing this.

125
00:10:40,192 --> 00:10:43,674
This is, I think, our fifth time around on design on this.

126
00:10:44,972 --> 00:10:53,077
I think we got it down pretty patently now, as long as the neighborhood agrees or likes it, or if there's any changes they would like us to make, we'll get thoughts up.

127
00:10:55,878 --> 00:10:56,058
Great.

128
00:10:56,078 --> 00:10:58,300
Thanks, Sal.

129
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:07,825
So with that, I mean, is there anyone from the community or on the Zoom right now that wants to ask any questions or have any comments about the proposal?

130
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:12,467
potentially you could just raise your hand or send me a message in the chat function.

131
00:11:13,167 --> 00:11:14,128
Barbara, I see you there.

132
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:15,448
Thanks.

133
00:11:15,989 --> 00:11:26,234
So I'm not sure that I'm entirely understanding how many residential units there are versus how many commercial units there are.

134
00:11:30,497 --> 00:11:33,358
Yes, ma'am.

135
00:11:33,418 --> 00:11:34,399
So it's one.

136
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:36,019
Thank you, Barbara, for your question.

137
00:11:36,059 --> 00:11:39,881
So there's one commercial unit on the on the ground floor.

138
00:11:40,481 --> 00:11:42,382
And then there's nine residential units.

139
00:11:44,222 --> 00:11:50,445
Okay, and do you have any expectation of what type of a commercial unit would go on the ground floor?

140
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:53,398
Sal, you want to jump in there?

141
00:11:53,498 --> 00:11:53,678
Yeah.

142
00:11:53,918 --> 00:11:56,380
We, we're not at that, that stage.

143
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,021
We don't know.

144
00:11:57,301 --> 00:11:58,762
We want to see what the neighbors would like.

145
00:11:58,782 --> 00:12:09,550
I mean, one of the, one of the, the, the city members had said, they said, you know something, because of the school, the parents, they want to wait for their children coming out of school.

146
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:12,112
So, obviously a coffee shop would be nice.

147
00:12:12,132 --> 00:12:17,016
So, something that's catered to parents where they can sit and wait while their children are coming out of school.

148
00:12:17,577 --> 00:12:20,379
That was a suggestion from one of the city staff.

149
00:12:20,859 --> 00:12:21,740
But we're not sure.

150
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,082
It's still open in the air that we haven't figured it out.

151
00:12:24,502 --> 00:12:26,844
We don't know what we're going to do with that space.

152
00:12:27,005 --> 00:12:31,348
If there's any suggestions that somebody would like to admit, we'd love to listen to it.

153
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:38,435
No, I just saw the parking would be for the residential units, but not for the commercial unit.

154
00:12:39,276 --> 00:12:39,616
Correct.

155
00:12:40,216 --> 00:12:47,103
OK, so just to be clear, I'm fairly confident that that stretch of Salem Street from Park Street to

156
00:12:48,143 --> 00:12:57,923
I don't know, probably that brick apartment building that's past where like the little laundry mat is is 15 minutes apart like that is 15 minute parking.

157
00:12:58,707 --> 00:13:10,240
So, I mean, that is just something for you all to keep in mind, like, and I know that's the same across the street where like Eddie's places and the hair salon.

158
00:13:11,302 --> 00:13:14,025
So that's very, that's short term parking.

159
00:13:14,345 --> 00:13:18,370
So I live right on Park Street on the other side of Salem Street.

160
00:13:19,584 --> 00:13:24,545
And all day long, we are, you know, we have a lot of that commercial parking.

161
00:13:24,885 --> 00:13:32,087
People are going to Eddie's place or going to the hair salon, or there's now a daycare center in that building that they're parked.

162
00:13:32,247 --> 00:13:36,308
I can come out of my house in the morning and people are literally blocking my driveway.

163
00:13:36,788 --> 00:13:46,810
So I guess that that would be my concern that whatever commercial unit goes in there, or if somebody moves into the residential unit and has more than

164
00:13:48,293 --> 00:13:51,475
one car, like where are those people going to park?

165
00:13:51,996 --> 00:13:58,360
And are they then going to end up on Park Street, which is already brutally hard to find parking because it's only parking on one side.

166
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,121
So just some things to keep in mind.

167
00:14:01,402 --> 00:14:02,622
Those would be my concerns.

168
00:14:03,043 --> 00:14:08,946
I would love to see that corner, like something done with it, but parking is a huge concern.

169
00:14:09,547 --> 00:14:09,887
Thank you.

170
00:14:11,068 --> 00:14:12,088
No consideration, Barbara.

171
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:16,731
And I live at

172
00:14:19,596 --> 00:14:20,556
208, which is right across.

173
00:14:21,337 --> 00:14:29,419
And that would be my only concern really too, is just like my driveway comes right out into where the parking lot is going to be, where all the entrances are.

174
00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:33,780
And then they shut down the road at like three o'clock when the school comes out.

175
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:44,503
And yeah, the only thing I would be somewhat interested in seeing is just, you know, the traffic that is going to be coming and going.

176
00:14:50,930 --> 00:15:06,839
Thank you and part and part of the, as you as you might know part of the site plan review process before the planning and development board, there will be a traffic and a parking component to that so that's the.

177
00:15:09,265 --> 00:15:14,150
the developer is going to have to go and get a traffic study done and we're going to have to present it as part of that.

178
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:19,915
So that that's definitely something that we've all talked about that we know is an issue that needs to be addressed.

179
00:15:20,295 --> 00:15:23,098
And it's not going to be something that we're really guessing.

180
00:15:23,118 --> 00:15:24,399
It's not really going to be guesswork.

181
00:15:24,419 --> 00:15:28,223
So we'll have a traffic study done as part of the initial approval process.

182
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:33,047
And not even with the building, but like a lot of parents who come to pick up their kids, they don't even have any like

183
00:15:33,826 --> 00:15:50,063
they don't care where they park, they'll park in my driveway, they'll park in front of my road, like, it's like, okay, so it might be, you know, for some of the residents who would live there, a little concerning, but you know, what can you do?

184
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:52,465
Yeah, totally understood.

185
00:15:52,485 --> 00:15:54,387
Eunice?

186
00:15:57,211 --> 00:15:58,613
Hi, yeah, thank you very much.

187
00:15:59,574 --> 00:16:00,755
I have two questions.

188
00:16:01,816 --> 00:16:05,920
First one may or may not be for developer or the city staff, I'm not sure.

189
00:16:07,161 --> 00:16:10,945
But I see 22 people on this zoom.

190
00:16:11,946 --> 00:16:20,795
And from my count, I'd say probably a full third of them are either affiliated with the developer or the city.

191
00:16:21,973 --> 00:16:24,216
Um, how well was.

192
00:16:25,096 --> 00:16:28,380
Was this meeting noticed to the neighborhood at all?

193
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:39,330
Um, in any fashion, other than just, you know, a simple, um, You know, posting on the city website, um, you know, was, was the general.

194
00:16:40,371 --> 00:16:45,793
neighborhood vicinity personally noticed at all, because it's a bit concerning.

195
00:16:45,853 --> 00:16:58,377
It's very concerning, actually, that, you know, there's about 14 people on this Zoom that are not somehow affiliated with the project or the city, and that's not really representative of

196
00:16:59,017 --> 00:17:02,978
people that might be concerned with this development.

197
00:17:03,719 --> 00:17:12,122
And my second question is, you talked about parking, and you said that you had eight parking spots

198
00:17:12,706 --> 00:17:26,630
in the back at the moment, but we'll probably be able to squeeze out nine for the, I think somebody said for the amount of units that you have, one per unit, but then you say that you have 11 units.

199
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:32,171
So do you have nine units or do you have 11 units?

200
00:17:32,691 --> 00:17:34,932
Do you have eight parking spaces, nine, 11?

201
00:17:35,432 --> 00:17:37,953
The numbers aren't adding up.

202
00:17:38,633 --> 00:17:38,913
Thank you.

203
00:17:39,905 --> 00:17:42,326
Sure, let me just clarify on the architecture front.

204
00:17:42,646 --> 00:17:51,990
We have nine units, and right now the proposed amount of parking spaces are eight, but we are trying to fit nine parking spaces.

205
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:56,172
So the goal is to get a one-in-one parking spot per unit.

206
00:17:56,252 --> 00:17:57,333
So there's nine units.

207
00:17:57,913 --> 00:18:03,015
Our site plan is showing eight parking spots, and we're gonna try to fit nine parking spots in total.

208
00:18:04,156 --> 00:18:09,298
Okay, but I think you said something about you had eight one-bedrooms and three two-bedrooms.

209
00:18:10,258 --> 00:18:23,085
Um, we have in total, uh, three, two bedrooms and, um, Uh, six, sorry, one bedrooms.

210
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:25,246
I misspoke.

211
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:26,606
Oh, okay.

212
00:18:26,626 --> 00:18:34,830
Cause I think the little blurb that you had down the bottom there on what you put up, um, different.

213
00:18:36,932 --> 00:18:38,172
It's nine units in total.

214
00:18:39,013 --> 00:18:39,333
Okay.

215
00:18:39,393 --> 00:18:39,673
Thank you.

216
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,080
Yeah.

217
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:45,621
And thanks Jacob and Eunice to your question.

218
00:18:45,701 --> 00:18:57,824
So we sent mailings out to, we obtained an abutters list from the city and sent mailers to all abutters within 400 feet.

219
00:18:58,745 --> 00:19:07,467
We had posted this on the, the city had posted this on their website and I had provided notice to various departments in town.

220
00:19:07,487 --> 00:19:08,207
I believe that

221
00:19:09,107 --> 00:19:12,790
the town conduct or the city conducted a reverse 911 on this.

222
00:19:14,831 --> 00:19:16,452
I personally, I was on the flyer.

223
00:19:16,552 --> 00:19:21,696
I received probably about a dozen emails with people saying that they couldn't attend but wanted more information on it.

224
00:19:21,736 --> 00:19:22,696
So we shared the plans.

225
00:19:22,716 --> 00:19:26,939
We're also recording this meeting, which I believe will be posted on the city's website.

226
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:33,784
And as I mentioned at the outset, this is really the first meeting with the community.

227
00:19:33,864 --> 00:19:35,665
We will have at least two

228
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:54,516
public hearings before city boards on this, and there very likely will be other opportunities to review our plans and comments so I wouldn't, I wouldn't look at this group as indicative of everyone that at least was notified about it, and there certainly will be other opportunities for people to attend.

229
00:19:55,156 --> 00:19:55,696
Thank you.

230
00:19:56,757 --> 00:19:57,057
Thank you.

231
00:19:57,722 --> 00:20:12,575
Adam if you don't mind I can jump in on that Victor Schrader, economic development director I'm sorry I'm not on video my internet's unstable but yeah reverse 911 call should have gone out I did ask the communications department to do that and we were.

232
00:20:13,696 --> 00:20:19,718
Remind me, Adam, we were targeting 400 feet, 300 feet with the notice?

233
00:20:19,738 --> 00:20:21,659
400 feet, yeah.

234
00:20:21,739 --> 00:20:23,959
The reverse 911 should have been the same.

235
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:31,462
So just for folks that are in the immediate area, you absolutely should have received notice of this.

236
00:20:31,902 --> 00:20:33,863
But please let us know if you didn't.

237
00:20:33,963 --> 00:20:34,843
We want to know about that.

238
00:20:37,044 --> 00:20:37,644
Thank you, Victor.

239
00:20:37,684 --> 00:20:39,605
Appreciate that.

240
00:20:40,265 --> 00:20:40,565
Cheryl?

241
00:20:42,937 --> 00:20:43,497
Good evening.

242
00:20:43,517 --> 00:20:43,557
Hi.

243
00:20:44,358 --> 00:20:45,298
I live on Park Street.

244
00:20:45,538 --> 00:20:50,040
I was in the waiting room and I only got let in when you said, and that concludes our presentation.

245
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,921
So that was really helpful.

246
00:20:53,902 --> 00:20:55,542
But I didn't get any notice.

247
00:20:55,642 --> 00:21:04,926
And since the section of Park Street that you're planning to build on has maybe six parking spaces, and I'm on the next block, your overflow cars will 100% be in my block.

248
00:21:07,336 --> 00:21:09,918
So it's pretty important that my neighbors know about it.

249
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:14,341
We have a lot of multifamilies in my section that don't all have driveways.

250
00:21:14,381 --> 00:21:16,602
So this is going to be a big impact on our lives.

251
00:21:17,342 --> 00:21:27,249
And Park, I'm wondering who is letting you believe that one parking space per unit is even feasible in this area because it's not?

252
00:21:29,536 --> 00:21:32,438
Our ordinances are for two per unit.

253
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:34,439
So one is a really deep dive.

254
00:21:35,139 --> 00:21:40,282
And will one of these units be affordable because you're adding nine dense units to our area?

255
00:21:40,302 --> 00:21:45,364
So I'm just wondering if there's a benefit to the community, to the school.

256
00:21:48,366 --> 00:21:50,207
School supply donations every year.

257
00:21:51,565 --> 00:21:57,870
I mean, yeah, I don't know if Fernando or Sal want to speak to that at this point.

258
00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:04,995
I mean, I don't know that they've determined what the configuration is.

259
00:22:05,055 --> 00:22:09,819
But certainly, I mean, parking, traffic, all those things are going to be part of the approval process.

260
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:17,685
I mean, I don't know, Cheryl, if you heard the comments of two of the other folks that were on before, but certainly, you know, parking,

261
00:22:18,645 --> 00:22:23,787
it's absolutely understood that it's something that needs to be considered as the project's developed.

262
00:22:24,887 --> 00:22:29,769
Yeah, because I'm just wondering why people would feel that that was an appropriate variance to ask.

263
00:22:29,789 --> 00:22:35,311
That's a 50% reduction in parking in a very dense area.

264
00:22:35,351 --> 00:22:38,012
And you're going to blot out the sun on that area of Sound Street.

265
00:22:38,032 --> 00:22:41,573
We have two mature trees there that I'm sure you're going to tear out.

266
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:44,351
No, there are no trees on the site right now.

267
00:22:44,411 --> 00:22:45,532
There are no trees whatsoever.

268
00:22:45,632 --> 00:22:47,173
No, they're on the city sidewalk.

269
00:22:47,514 --> 00:22:49,215
But we're not touching them.

270
00:22:49,255 --> 00:22:50,936
We can't touch those more.

271
00:22:50,976 --> 00:22:58,882
Number two, if I'm correct, I think the zoning has just changed or it's in the process of changing one car per unit.

272
00:22:59,302 --> 00:23:01,063
And it's not the two per one any longer.

273
00:23:01,184 --> 00:23:02,785
It's one car per unit.

274
00:23:03,405 --> 00:23:06,928
Most of our bedrooms, most of our units are all one bedrooms, not all two.

275
00:23:08,285 --> 00:23:10,807
It hasn't changed yet, and it's not going to be one.

276
00:23:10,907 --> 00:23:14,329
It's going to be one and a half, maybe, but it hasn't gone through yet.

277
00:23:15,329 --> 00:23:17,050
Jacob, how many two bedrooms we have?

278
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:19,952
Doesn't matter.

279
00:23:19,992 --> 00:23:21,853
Right now, we have two two bedrooms.

280
00:23:22,253 --> 00:23:23,134
Two bedrooms, OK.

281
00:23:23,154 --> 00:23:36,742
So our study that we have, there's more and more people taking bicycles on the public T now these days, and not necessarily driving.

282
00:23:37,631 --> 00:23:47,016
You, myself, maybe majority of these people still drive, but all the new professionals, young professionals, single families, no children, don't, a lot of them don't drive any longer.

283
00:23:47,036 --> 00:23:51,238
A lot of them just have the car, they leave the cars, they look at cars in the parking lot.

284
00:23:51,258 --> 00:23:52,279
But that's what we considered.

285
00:23:52,579 --> 00:23:56,061
That's how we came to determination of one parking spot per unit.

286
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:58,302
Some of these people won't even have cars.

287
00:23:58,962 --> 00:24:07,287
I've done enough developments knowing that we've always had more than enough parking, but there's always empty parking spots in the driveway, always in the garage.

288
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:08,093
always.

289
00:24:08,894 --> 00:24:13,756
So with that said, we, we, we tend to do our parking study.

290
00:24:13,876 --> 00:24:15,057
We intend to do all that.

291
00:24:15,197 --> 00:24:19,559
We're not going to leave it out there saying, let's, well, let's see what happens.

292
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:23,981
And if it goes from there, we, that's one of our assignments that we're going to be doing.

293
00:24:24,121 --> 00:24:26,223
We have to do that for the zoning board.

294
00:24:27,183 --> 00:24:34,827
So would you be willing to deed restrict on no cars from that building will be allowed to get permits and park on the street.

295
00:24:35,725 --> 00:24:40,666
that they're doing that in South Boston when they're short of parking.

296
00:24:41,447 --> 00:24:42,627
It's a good point.

297
00:24:43,087 --> 00:24:44,567
Do they have permit parking over there?

298
00:24:45,928 --> 00:24:47,348
They will once you come.

299
00:24:48,208 --> 00:24:50,689
Well, I mean, it's not out of the question.

300
00:24:51,789 --> 00:24:56,711
Sections of sections of our Medford does permit parking currently by street.

301
00:24:57,231 --> 00:25:00,592
They're looking at doing it by zone and

302
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:09,651
Intentionally shorting your parking, rolling the dice that your units won't have cars, then you should bear the burden and not the neighborhood.

303
00:25:10,092 --> 00:25:16,533
You should deed restrict your tenants owners from ever getting permit parking.

304
00:25:18,133 --> 00:25:19,013
The express bus here.

305
00:25:19,053 --> 00:25:21,974
So a lot more people are getting cars because the T cut our bus.

306
00:25:24,734 --> 00:25:25,074
Victor.

307
00:25:25,114 --> 00:25:26,955
I see, I see your, your, your hands raised.

308
00:25:26,975 --> 00:25:28,395
Do you want to comment?

309
00:25:30,937 --> 00:25:33,280
Yeah, I just wanted to clarify on the zoning.

310
00:25:34,141 --> 00:25:38,826
Cheryl's right, the new zoning ordinance is not in effect yet.

311
00:25:38,946 --> 00:25:44,072
I think it will be when this project applies for relief.

312
00:25:50,399 --> 00:25:59,667
The current zoning ordinance or the new zoning ordinances as drafted is 1.5 parking spaces per unit.

313
00:26:00,607 --> 00:26:02,229
So the project will need to seek relief.

314
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:13,578
It'll be by special permit, not variance, but that'll be part of the relief that they'll need to seek from either the zoning board or community development board.

315
00:26:15,139 --> 00:26:15,339
Great.

316
00:26:15,379 --> 00:26:16,000
Thanks, Victor.

317
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,161
I'm just trying to go in order here.

318
00:26:18,302 --> 00:26:18,542
Alex,

319
00:26:20,275 --> 00:26:20,775
Your hand raised.

320
00:26:24,076 --> 00:26:24,536
Alex?

321
00:26:24,696 --> 00:26:25,236
Yes, sorry.

322
00:26:25,256 --> 00:26:25,736
Yeah, sorry.

323
00:26:26,377 --> 00:26:27,697
I'm sorry I'm not on video.

324
00:26:27,817 --> 00:26:30,457
I'm holding a baby, so kind of multitasking here.

325
00:26:30,477 --> 00:26:31,338
All right.

326
00:26:31,898 --> 00:26:43,461
Yeah, I actually was just going to kind of bounce on one of the comments that Cheryl said, which was my main question or thought about this development is for affordable units.

327
00:26:43,901 --> 00:26:48,722
I just would strongly, strongly encourage you all to do whatever you could to

328
00:26:49,402 --> 00:26:55,088
add some units potentially so that we could be past the 10 unit threshold for inclusionary zoning.

329
00:26:55,528 --> 00:27:02,195
That new law went into play, it's still pretty new in 2019, and really hasn't been taken advantage of at all.

330
00:27:02,515 --> 00:27:08,441
And I would really, really like to see more developers taking advantage of that.

331
00:27:08,521 --> 00:27:11,924
So personally, parking, your comment about

332
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:17,803
you know, young folks taking bus and bike definitely resonated with me.

333
00:27:17,823 --> 00:27:25,532
You know, I have a young family, we have two kids, we're a one car family, we have a cargo bike, we love it.

334
00:27:26,213 --> 00:27:27,515
And I do think that that is

335
00:27:28,381 --> 00:27:30,403
you know, becoming more and more of a thing.

336
00:27:30,463 --> 00:27:32,284
And I'm really happy to see that too.

337
00:27:32,344 --> 00:27:49,017
So parking is not my number one concern, but I would think for, you know, for Medford as a whole, uh, really, really wanting to see that inclusionary zoning be taken advantage of more so we can provide more below market rate units as well as market rate, because they both, you know, that's a benefit to the city of Medford, um, just as a whole.

338
00:27:49,077 --> 00:27:51,019
So that's, that's my, my biggest thing.

339
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:53,340
Okay.

340
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:53,621
Great.

341
00:27:53,661 --> 00:27:54,081
Thanks Alex.

342
00:27:54,101 --> 00:27:55,222
We appreciate it.

343
00:27:57,123 --> 00:27:57,884
Uh, Jamie.

344
00:27:59,275 --> 00:28:02,696
Yeah, I was just going to sort of go off some of that.

345
00:28:03,176 --> 00:28:10,598
I mean, I don't know the ordinances and like if 10 units is better than nine or what that means.

346
00:28:11,118 --> 00:28:17,700
I mean, ideally, if people, everyone takes bus, you know, buses and cars, and that's great.

347
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:24,341
I mean, not less, but I don't know necessarily if more is something I want them right across the street.

348
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:26,702
But I will say that

349
00:28:27,517 --> 00:28:34,162
you know, the parking is the biggest issue, obviously, but that area was sort of an eyesore for a long time.

350
00:28:34,222 --> 00:28:41,366
So I'm hoping that this does sort of boost up value and does do good for a lot of the people who live around here.

351
00:28:41,967 --> 00:28:55,356
So, you know, do I want to see construction all day and stuff like that, but that just comes with it and the parking, but hopefully it benefits us in the long run with increasing the value of the area.

352
00:28:58,564 --> 00:28:58,744
Great.

353
00:28:58,764 --> 00:28:59,565
Thanks, Jamie.

354
00:28:59,585 --> 00:29:01,107
Appreciate it.

355
00:29:01,127 --> 00:29:01,567
Navar?

356
00:29:01,587 --> 00:29:04,871
Hi there, William Navar.

357
00:29:04,891 --> 00:29:08,895
Yeah, I wanted to say something similar to what Alex said.

358
00:29:09,275 --> 00:29:10,517
I think it's really great that

359
00:29:11,139 --> 00:29:17,383
the city's going to be able to welcome five, sorry, nine new households as neighbors.

360
00:29:17,763 --> 00:29:19,044
I think that's a wonderful thing.

361
00:29:19,464 --> 00:29:31,991
I think one of the wonderful things about building housing here in the city as opposed to out in, you know, Billerica or something is that's going to give people the chance to live without a car, which is something that people really value nowadays.

362
00:29:32,692 --> 00:29:33,873
And a lot of people,

363
00:29:34,753 --> 00:29:38,354
feel they're forced to own a car because they can't afford housing close to the city.

364
00:29:38,834 --> 00:29:43,376
And this, I think, is going to be a real benefit to us if we have more people living here in the city.

365
00:29:44,936 --> 00:29:48,117
Because people that live out of the city drive their cars through our city.

366
00:29:48,438 --> 00:29:50,138
We're what's known as a cut-through town.

367
00:29:51,218 --> 00:29:55,720
So when we send people to Billerica, they come back and drive through.

368
00:29:57,913 --> 00:30:11,429
As for the amount of units, I think it would be really great, and I think it's important to note that the City Council really did, one of the reasons they're settling at 1.5 spaces per unit,

369
00:30:13,612 --> 00:30:18,795
is because there's going to be a provision that you won't need a variance to reduce the parking.

370
00:30:19,115 --> 00:30:20,856
You'll be able to use special permit.

371
00:30:21,237 --> 00:30:30,042
And that's one of the reasons they're OK with leaving it even so high as 1.5, is that it's easier than it was before to knock that down.

372
00:30:30,542 --> 00:30:37,166
They were thinking to do a 1.2, and they said, OK, let's do 1.5 with the understanding that a special permit knocks that down.

373
00:30:37,186 --> 00:30:39,167
And that's deliberate.

374
00:30:39,187 --> 00:30:40,168
That's not a loophole.

375
00:30:41,088 --> 00:30:43,391
As for the number of units, I would love to see more.

376
00:30:44,432 --> 00:30:53,664
It would be really good if you could get inclusionary zoning, 10 units or more, put another floor on there, welcome a couple more neighbors, one of them affordable.

377
00:30:53,764 --> 00:30:55,406
I would really love to see that.

378
00:30:56,945 --> 00:31:01,368
And if if there are certain reasons regulatory why you can't do that.

379
00:31:02,408 --> 00:31:25,160
I'd be open to open to hearing about that because you know our our City Council and everything really wants rules that make it so people can do this community need so just as a helpful thing to the community and it can be really great if if there's a good if there's a reason that's not possible because the rules are something just let us know that we can learn from that going forward and advocate for things to make to make that situation better going forward.

380
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:25,720
Thanks.

381
00:31:27,503 --> 00:31:29,044
Great, thanks so much, appreciate it.

382
00:31:31,625 --> 00:31:33,746
Anyone else with any questions, comments?

383
00:31:36,046 --> 00:31:56,835
If I may, the idea of the fourth floor did come across our desk at the time, and I think in that particular zoning, I think we have the right to go four stories, but I thought, and we had a long discussion about this, I think the majority of the neighbors would know

384
00:31:57,705 --> 00:31:59,587
like that idea of going four stories.

385
00:32:00,468 --> 00:32:02,491
I mean, we don't mind inclusionary housing.

386
00:32:02,531 --> 00:32:04,453
I mean, you know, this is what we do it all the time.

387
00:32:04,973 --> 00:32:09,078
And the nine units we have there now are just the right size.

388
00:32:09,138 --> 00:32:16,587
I mean, if we went another story and, you know, Jacob, can you tell us, what are your thoughts on another story and how many units you can put in there?

389
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:17,880
Sure.

390
00:32:19,341 --> 00:32:19,762
Sure.

391
00:32:19,902 --> 00:32:24,985
I mean, obviously, one issue with going higher is there's the height limit in Medford.

392
00:32:25,405 --> 00:32:27,866
So that'd be some relief you'd be asking for there.

393
00:32:28,167 --> 00:32:32,509
So the current 35 foot height limit is being achieved with this design.

394
00:32:32,589 --> 00:32:40,234
So by adding another story, we'd probably do a similar floor plan and get another, you know, maybe four units in there, which we have per floor.

395
00:32:40,954 --> 00:32:48,220
So you would go, you know, maybe 45 feet, which is going to be taller than the building across the street.

396
00:32:49,121 --> 00:32:51,643
But there are some taller buildings in the area.

397
00:32:52,044 --> 00:32:56,988
But having said that, you could add another four units if you just added another story on top.

398
00:32:57,328 --> 00:33:01,212
But it would be something we would want to look at also the shadows that would be cast

399
00:33:01,912 --> 00:33:10,516
And that's another parking concern where if you add another four units, you know, one of the reasons we were trying to hit nine units was because of the parking issue.

400
00:33:10,936 --> 00:33:13,877
So we've been the goal has been a one in one.

401
00:33:14,277 --> 00:33:15,898
And we think that's a good ratio.

402
00:33:15,918 --> 00:33:17,839
I know it's a really challenging site.

403
00:33:18,419 --> 00:33:21,621
So having one in one is beneficial.

404
00:33:21,961 --> 00:33:26,443
But if you add another four units in there, it's going to be hard to add more parking.

405
00:33:26,483 --> 00:33:31,425
You're going to start shrinking that commercial space on the first floor if we want to start adding more parking.

406
00:33:31,805 --> 00:33:43,954
The next thing you know the whole building is going to be up on people say, and you're going to lose the entire corner there on Park Street and Salem Street, so we could try to go up to, you know, to be at another for you.

407
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:55,133
option for maybe go back to rooms and try to expand the floor plate in that realm.

408
00:33:55,433 --> 00:34:03,118
But talking to the town earlier, we thought it was a good mix of having two beds and one bed is really a need for the city in the sweet spot.

409
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:11,504
Great.

410
00:34:13,085 --> 00:34:13,625
Thanks, Jacob.

411
00:34:17,515 --> 00:34:17,795
All right.

412
00:34:17,896 --> 00:34:20,680
Any, any, any other thoughts, comments, questions.

413
00:34:24,927 --> 00:34:30,357
About, uh, uh, any, anyone from the city, Victor and anything before we wrap up here.

414
00:34:33,984 --> 00:34:36,566
No, Adam, thanks for presenting today.

415
00:34:36,586 --> 00:34:41,989
I mean, the purpose of these meetings is to hear from neighbors before an application is submitted.

416
00:34:42,009 --> 00:34:44,690
So thank you all for coming out.

417
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:50,813
And we hope that the developer will take your comments into consideration.

418
00:34:50,953 --> 00:34:56,717
And please, you know, continue to show up as this project goes through the process.

419
00:34:56,837 --> 00:34:58,938
And thank you for your time.

420
00:35:00,016 --> 00:35:00,777
Great, thank you, Victor.

421
00:35:00,797 --> 00:35:01,437
I appreciate that.

422
00:35:01,737 --> 00:35:04,379
Looks like we have one hand raised from Ann Sullivan.

423
00:35:05,339 --> 00:35:06,120
Hi, I'm sorry.

424
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,261
I also did not get to see the presentation.

425
00:35:08,361 --> 00:35:11,523
I came in a little bit late and was not able to get on right away.

426
00:35:12,044 --> 00:35:15,346
So I can't really comment because I have not seen the design.

427
00:35:15,826 --> 00:35:22,330
But the building across the street from it, the corner of Park and Salem, I believe it's called the Potter building, is very unique.

428
00:35:22,911 --> 00:35:25,492
You drive down Salem Street and you notice it right away.

429
00:35:25,532 --> 00:35:26,833
It's a three story building.

430
00:35:27,033 --> 00:35:27,394
It has

431
00:35:28,454 --> 00:35:53,200
an interesting roofline and whatever and is there any design element that takes a look at what is offered on that side of the street so there's almost like a balance rather than putting up a modern you know very different kind of building and then across the street you have this lovely brick building with you know a sort of a angled entrance and all of that I mean

432
00:35:54,545 --> 00:35:57,233
I didn't get to see the design, so I have no.

433
00:35:57,755 --> 00:36:01,767
yeah can you can you make me host again at a really quick door.

434
00:36:02,127 --> 00:36:02,647
That'd be great.

435
00:36:02,687 --> 00:36:02,907
Thank you.

436
00:36:02,947 --> 00:36:03,827
And I apologize.

437
00:36:04,007 --> 00:36:05,228
No problem, Anne.

438
00:36:05,268 --> 00:36:07,908
We absolutely love the Potter building across the street.

439
00:36:07,948 --> 00:36:11,429
So it's been a huge influence on what we've been designing.

440
00:36:11,929 --> 00:36:14,790
So I just need to wait to become host.

441
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:17,150
And I'll show you kind of our rendering in 3D view here.

442
00:36:18,850 --> 00:36:21,231
We think that building is absolutely gorgeous.

443
00:36:21,291 --> 00:36:30,773
And compared to some of the things that have been being built down the street, we want to definitely play off our neighbor across the street with the detailing, the window trim, the bump outs, the brickwork.

444
00:36:31,093 --> 00:36:32,133
That's yeah great.

445
00:36:32,213 --> 00:36:33,774
That is absolutely gorgeous.

446
00:36:35,454 --> 00:36:41,977
I'm the host now so just give me a quick second here I'm going to share my screen, and hopefully you can see this rendering we've been working on.

447
00:36:42,697 --> 00:36:48,719
So, if you could see the trim here in all this detail, we want to do something very similar.

448
00:36:49,139 --> 00:36:54,901
to the Salem street side where we have these bump outs and even on the park side we want to do these.

449
00:36:55,061 --> 00:36:55,381
Okay.

450
00:36:55,881 --> 00:37:07,085
We want to the brick work on the first floor we want to do our best to try to match the combination of the yellow brick on the lower end and the higher red brick light brick on the top do some sort of blend on the lower end.

451
00:37:07,485 --> 00:37:12,150
We want to keep the same kind of rough opening scale on the first floor, that is, on the second floor.

452
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:18,896
We want to play with the banding that they have on the roof deck and on the middle part too, as you can kind of see here.

453
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:23,781
I'm going to take you to these axons really quick so you can kind of see a little bit more 3D.

454
00:37:24,041 --> 00:37:28,405
That building is a high influence on us, so it's definitely something we're taking in consideration.

455
00:37:28,465 --> 00:37:30,708
I mean, we're still early in the project, obviously.

456
00:37:31,208 --> 00:37:34,590
But 100%, we love that.

457
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:37,212
And these aren't the finished color schemes or anything, right?

458
00:37:37,232 --> 00:37:39,873
This is just sort of your initial design.

459
00:37:39,953 --> 00:37:40,854
No, no.

460
00:37:40,914 --> 00:37:43,796
By no means are these the finished color schemes.

461
00:37:44,156 --> 00:37:54,662
We're just trying to show the idea is going to have a contrast of colors and play on what's across the street.

462
00:37:54,902 --> 00:37:55,963
It's a little challenging.

463
00:37:55,983 --> 00:37:57,424
They used this green there.

464
00:37:57,504 --> 00:37:59,085
So we don't want to really match that.

465
00:37:59,593 --> 00:38:00,534
Right.

466
00:38:00,814 --> 00:38:06,340
And we still want to have a little bit of modern, you know, we don't want to look like something we're trying to copy from the past.

467
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:11,565
So this corner in the front, which we're still working on, is going to be a huge opportunity for us.

468
00:38:17,932 --> 00:38:20,534
I got a little bit of background noise there.

469
00:38:20,734 --> 00:38:22,395
I hope that answers your question a little bit.

470
00:38:22,415 --> 00:38:23,656
Yeah, thank you.

471
00:38:24,397 --> 00:38:26,098
I missed the beginning, so thank you very much.

472
00:38:26,118 --> 00:38:27,579
I have one other question for you.

473
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:40,649
I'm listening to some of the abutting neighbors talking about parking, and I noticed that on number 237 Park Street, which is almost two doors down from this building, it is up for sale now,

474
00:38:41,737 --> 00:38:46,524
which might be a tear down and which might be another proposed development.

475
00:38:48,747 --> 00:38:55,716
And has anyone been aware of that, that the house further down the street?

476
00:39:05,719 --> 00:39:07,060
And I think we lost you there for a moment.

477
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:12,462
OK, I think I was muted there.

478
00:39:12,482 --> 00:39:14,703
237 Park Street is up for sale right now.

479
00:39:15,623 --> 00:39:22,166
And it's I'm listening to the neighbors talking about parking, which is right across the street from the school and how difficult it is.

480
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:30,049
And it looks like it might be a teardown and it might be another multi multi use spot.

481
00:39:30,569 --> 00:39:31,130
Has anyone

482
00:39:32,524 --> 00:39:37,308
you know, looked at the timing of, of developing that property while this was going up.

483
00:39:37,328 --> 00:39:44,994
Thanks.

484
00:39:59,104 --> 00:40:15,776
And if you're still with us in, I don't know that that particular property is, I mean, it's certainly on our radar, but I don't know that there was much consideration to what could be developed there currently, considering it's current use.

485
00:40:16,757 --> 00:40:23,682
Although if that's incorrect, Fernando or Sal, if you have anything else to add to that, please feel free.

486
00:40:23,782 --> 00:40:27,785
I was gonna say you could make a parking lot out of it.

487
00:40:31,657 --> 00:40:43,800
We did try to purchase the other, talk to the neighbors on the side of the property to buy the other properties and try to enlarge the building or get more units or get more parking, but that didn't work.

488
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:47,561
So that's pretty stupid, the same play that we have.

489
00:40:48,221 --> 00:40:49,981
Okay, thank you.

490
00:40:50,822 --> 00:40:56,923
All right, great, thanks.

491
00:40:58,544 --> 00:41:04,989
Uh, well, yeah, and just to echo, uh, Victor's comments, I do want to say, you know, thanks so much for everyone who came out.

492
00:41:05,349 --> 00:41:12,734
Um, this is the beginning of, of, of a conversation relative to this, um, this proposal.

493
00:41:13,474 --> 00:41:24,542
And, uh, you know, my, my contact information was included on the, uh, the handout, uh, and the poster, but my email is ARB at R I W.com.

494
00:41:30,692 --> 00:41:38,038
But I think that everyone here will certainly be hearing from us as things progress.

495
00:41:38,198 --> 00:41:40,200
And thank you again all for your comments.

496
00:41:41,581 --> 00:41:44,043
And with that, have a great night.

497
00:41:44,183 --> 00:41:45,144
We'll all speak soon.

498
00:41:45,164 --> 00:41:46,244
Thank you, everybody.

499
00:41:46,285 --> 00:41:46,905
Really quick.

500
00:41:47,385 --> 00:41:50,528
Adam, everybody, this meeting was recorded.

501
00:41:50,748 --> 00:41:57,894
So if you didn't make it to the beginning, you have an opportunity to go back and look at us walking through this.

502
00:41:58,274 --> 00:41:59,155
And thank you, everybody.

503
00:42:00,552 --> 00:42:01,056
Thank you, everybody.

504
00:42:01,318 --> 00:42:01,560
Thank you.
