1
00:00:00,297 --> 00:00:01,038
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening, everyone.

2
00:00:01,138 --> 00:00:01,878
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you hear me all right.

3
00:00:01,898 --> 00:00:03,179
[SPEAKER_06]: I can hear.

4
00:00:03,299 --> 00:00:04,801
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

5
00:00:05,301 --> 00:00:05,521
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.

6
00:00:05,922 --> 00:00:06,282
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, thanks.

7
00:00:06,422 --> 00:00:07,803
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks everybody for joining us.

8
00:00:08,964 --> 00:00:11,466
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just gonna make sure that we don't have anybody else in the waiting room here.

9
00:00:11,486 --> 00:00:11,526
[SPEAKER_06]: So,

10
00:00:15,062 --> 00:00:16,002
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Adam Bardosky.

11
00:00:16,022 --> 00:00:17,303
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm the attorney for the project.

12
00:00:17,343 --> 00:00:25,304
[SPEAKER_06]: We're here tonight to talk about Salem Place, which is a proposed development at 290 Salem Street.

13
00:00:25,905 --> 00:00:33,907
[SPEAKER_06]: With us tonight from the architectural team is Jacob Levine and Nyree Stewart, as well as the developers, Fernando Bento and Sal Parisio.

14
00:00:34,647 --> 00:00:36,947
[SPEAKER_06]: So at the outset, I'd like to thank you all for joining.

15
00:00:36,967 --> 00:00:40,448
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks like we have about 20 something here.

16
00:00:41,188 --> 00:00:43,369
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'd also like to thank the city

17
00:00:47,073 --> 00:00:48,134
[SPEAKER_06]: in putting this together.

18
00:00:48,414 --> 00:00:51,015
[SPEAKER_06]: Victor Schrader, I believe, is here somewhere.

19
00:00:51,035 --> 00:00:58,438
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to say thanks to Victor for putting out a few calls and just kind of helping to facilitate this whole thing.

20
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:02,100
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is gonna be, this is an exciting project.

21
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:07,882
[SPEAKER_06]: We've been waiting to have an opportunity to talk with members of the community on this project for some time.

22
00:01:08,623 --> 00:01:11,264
[SPEAKER_06]: This is really gonna be the first opportunity to see the project.

23
00:01:12,313 --> 00:01:14,274
[SPEAKER_06]: There's been nothing filed with the City so far.

24
00:01:14,314 --> 00:01:28,879
[SPEAKER_06]: We anticipate that we'll have this meeting and at minimum we'll have to go before Planning and Development for site plan review and likely then next to the Zoning Board of Appeals for the zoning relief that's needed on the project.

25
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:36,982
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're really just here tonight to tell you a little bit about the project, what's in store, what it looks like, share some of the plans with you,

26
00:01:38,213 --> 00:01:51,385
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a mixed use development so it's going to be, it's proposed to be three stories, nine units in total with parking and a commercial unit on the first floor, there will be residential units on the second and third floor and a roof deck.

27
00:01:53,161 --> 00:02:01,085
[SPEAKER_06]: With that, I think I'm going to pass it to the architectural team to share their screen and walk through some of the actual plans.

28
00:02:01,525 --> 00:02:08,870
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'll have an opportunity to have you folks ask questions and really stay as long as you'd like.

29
00:02:11,071 --> 00:02:12,872
[SPEAKER_02]: So let me see.

30
00:02:12,892 --> 00:02:17,995
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, is it going to be Jacob or Nyree that's going to walk through the plans here?

31
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,751
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening, everybody.

32
00:02:23,031 --> 00:02:28,736
[SPEAKER_02]: It just says host disabled participants screen sharing right now.

33
00:02:28,796 --> 00:02:31,278
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm gonna sorry, I'm a little new to the hosting.

34
00:02:31,298 --> 00:02:32,819
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to make you a host.

35
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:36,522
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, for a moment, Jacob, let's see if you let's see if you can handle it.

36
00:02:36,582 --> 00:02:37,082
[SPEAKER_06]: If I do that.

37
00:02:37,122 --> 00:02:37,482
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

38
00:02:39,884 --> 00:02:40,465
[SPEAKER_13]: Now the hosts.

39
00:02:42,232 --> 00:02:42,932
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, everybody.

40
00:02:42,952 --> 00:02:46,093
[SPEAKER_13]: So hopefully y'all can see my screen here.

41
00:02:46,193 --> 00:02:48,514
[SPEAKER_13]: Good evening and thank you all for joining us.

42
00:02:49,074 --> 00:02:55,935
[SPEAKER_13]: We're the architecture team myself Jacob Levine is the project lead, and I have by my side Nyree Stewart, the project architect.

43
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,456
[SPEAKER_13]: We are representing SL Haas Group.

44
00:02:58,696 --> 00:03:01,197
[SPEAKER_13]: We are a local firm here in Boston.

45
00:03:02,477 --> 00:03:05,962
[SPEAKER_13]: So, I'm going to run you through some images of the project.

46
00:03:06,002 --> 00:03:16,817
[SPEAKER_13]: This is obviously the new building on the left right here, just a little rendering, showing our new proposed design, looking down Salem Street with Park Street on the left.

47
00:03:17,909 --> 00:03:26,636
[SPEAKER_13]: we can come back and view some of these images as soon as we kind of run through some of the numbers on them so everyone can understand what we're trying to achieve with the floor plans themselves.

48
00:03:27,296 --> 00:03:32,740
[SPEAKER_13]: So right now we're looking at a unit with two bedroom units.

49
00:03:33,241 --> 00:03:40,106
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a need for it's important to have a mix of one beds and two bedrooms.

50
00:03:41,767 --> 00:03:52,238
[SPEAKER_13]: So in total, our building is 3000 square feet of square footage on the first floor here on the left, you can see Salem Street is on this side down here.

51
00:03:52,718 --> 00:03:57,103
[SPEAKER_13]: So we would propose about 1400 square feet of commercial space on this first floor.

52
00:03:57,703 --> 00:04:04,584
[SPEAKER_13]: That would be an excellent opportunity to activate this corner on Park Street and Salem Street, give that space back to the town.

53
00:04:05,924 --> 00:04:08,785
[SPEAKER_13]: In the back, we want to do parking off Park Street.

54
00:04:09,645 --> 00:04:14,326
[SPEAKER_13]: Right now, we're showing eight parking spots, but we're going to try to get nine parking spots.

55
00:04:14,366 --> 00:04:15,606
[SPEAKER_13]: That would be one per unit.

56
00:04:15,966 --> 00:04:21,087
[SPEAKER_13]: Depending on how the final structural system lays out, we're pretty confident we can get nine parking spots.

57
00:04:21,467 --> 00:04:24,028
[SPEAKER_13]: But right now, we're just showing eight parking spots in the back.

58
00:04:25,928 --> 00:04:29,009
[SPEAKER_13]: not pull in through Salem Street as that's the busier road.

59
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:33,331
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to have the parking come and go two-way parking from Park Street.

60
00:04:33,991 --> 00:04:45,275
[SPEAKER_13]: You can enter the building if you are a resident from the back on one of these two entrances, one right here by bike storage and the other through these main doors in which you'd go up the stairs or an elevator.

61
00:04:45,595 --> 00:04:51,717
[SPEAKER_13]: We have one unit on the first floor that would be either a one bed with an office or we can make it a two bed.

62
00:04:53,676 --> 00:04:59,338
[SPEAKER_13]: Dumpsters will be on the right side back here for ease of access to get them in and out for trash.

63
00:05:00,418 --> 00:05:10,621
[SPEAKER_13]: As we work our way up, we're going to have in total, we have three two beds and eight one beds in the whole project.

64
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:12,282
[SPEAKER_13]: So what I'm outlining here

65
00:05:13,141 --> 00:05:15,926
[SPEAKER_13]: you're going to have a central stair corridor as shown here.

66
00:05:15,987 --> 00:05:23,240
[SPEAKER_13]: You come up through a hallway and you are going to have excellent views in all the units with plenty of natural light.

67
00:05:23,987 --> 00:05:37,194
[SPEAKER_13]: We have a large two-bedroom unit, which is 1,500 square feet, with a balcony overlooking Salem Street and Park Street to activate that corner, along with a typical one-bedroom unit is totaling about 800 square feet.

68
00:05:37,794 --> 00:05:43,657
[SPEAKER_13]: So the two-bedroom units are 1,500 square feet, and the one-bedroom units are about 800 square feet.

69
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:49,680
[SPEAKER_13]: The floor plan duplicates on the third floor as you continue up the stairs with one common hallway.

70
00:05:50,872 --> 00:05:53,714
[SPEAKER_13]: making everything structurally work accordingly.

71
00:05:53,834 --> 00:06:08,725
[SPEAKER_13]: We're trying to work with some of these bump-outs to, if you go back to the rendering, capture the essence of this project, which is a great model example of classic architecture in Medford, using the bump-outs here.

72
00:06:09,685 --> 00:06:17,671
[SPEAKER_13]: The color scheme at this point hasn't been finalized, but we wanna do something with a lot of detail, similar to the ornate style across the street.

73
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:23,003
[SPEAKER_13]: As we work our way up to the last floor, we're proposing a roof deck for all the tenants.

74
00:06:23,663 --> 00:06:25,824
[SPEAKER_13]: This roof space is still being developed.

75
00:06:26,484 --> 00:06:30,945
[SPEAKER_13]: We think it would be a great opportunity to look over the street and add some activity to the roof.

76
00:06:31,486 --> 00:06:37,768
[SPEAKER_13]: We would love to try to have sustainable features in our buildings, such as solar panels or maybe rainwater collectors in the back end.

77
00:06:40,464 --> 00:06:47,390
[SPEAKER_13]: Lastly, I'm going to show you here, we're going to try to reuse some of the foundation of the existing facility, depending on the condition of it.

78
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:57,017
[SPEAKER_13]: You would either put a gym or mechanical space back down in that basement, but trying to be sustainable and use as much of that foundation as possible and not dig more than we have to.

79
00:06:57,738 --> 00:07:00,981
[SPEAKER_13]: On the right, you can see our proposed site plan.

80
00:07:02,562 --> 00:07:03,983
[SPEAKER_13]: We can get into a little bit more detail.

81
00:07:06,294 --> 00:07:07,274
[SPEAKER_13]: with the proposed building.

82
00:07:07,755 --> 00:07:24,980
[SPEAKER_13]: The building gross square footage on all floors is 13,000 square feet, so it's broken down into 3,000 square feet on the first floor and 5,000 square feet on the second and 5,000 square feet on the third floor, outlined by this red ring you see here and this red ring you see here.

83
00:07:26,016 --> 00:07:27,338
[SPEAKER_13]: Lastly, our elevations.

84
00:07:27,719 --> 00:07:36,394
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a very tricky site when I say tricky, you can see the site plan here how it's a really hard angle, so they, it's

85
00:07:37,443 --> 00:07:40,084
[SPEAKER_13]: very difficult to try to work with that angle.

86
00:07:40,104 --> 00:07:44,367
[SPEAKER_13]: So the elevations might be a little bit confusing, but I'll try walking you guys through them.

87
00:07:44,887 --> 00:07:48,349
[SPEAKER_13]: This would be what you would see from Salem Street side.

88
00:07:49,189 --> 00:07:52,951
[SPEAKER_13]: So this would be the entrance to the commercial street down below.

89
00:07:52,971 --> 00:07:57,654
[SPEAKER_13]: These would be the bump outs that we were showing to represent the bump outs across the street.

90
00:08:00,283 --> 00:08:03,765
[SPEAKER_13]: This would be the view from the Park Street side of things.

91
00:08:03,845 --> 00:08:06,127
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is where the parking would be, under here.

92
00:08:06,147 --> 00:08:08,308
[SPEAKER_13]: So you would park actually under the building.

93
00:08:09,409 --> 00:08:13,692
[SPEAKER_13]: And this would be a very beautiful facade to see from Park Street.

94
00:08:13,892 --> 00:08:17,715
[SPEAKER_13]: Everything is balanced, equal with a lot of thought and detail that goes into it.

95
00:08:18,515 --> 00:08:23,859
[SPEAKER_13]: And these are the other two, not as visible sides, but still have some character to them.

96
00:08:24,836 --> 00:08:30,743
[SPEAKER_13]: And that is where we are at with the design right now as we're continuing to explore color options and materials.

97
00:08:31,204 --> 00:08:36,951
[SPEAKER_13]: We certainly want to use some brickwork that tries to match the existing brickwork from across the street.

98
00:08:37,491 --> 00:08:41,876
[SPEAKER_13]: We're trying to use, excuse me, sustainable and durable materials that will last.

99
00:08:42,497 --> 00:08:44,078
[SPEAKER_13]: more so than just vinyl siding.

100
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:50,884
[SPEAKER_13]: And we want to stay away from any sort of metal panels that was used down the street that has the really modern rustic look.

101
00:08:51,724 --> 00:08:57,769
[SPEAKER_13]: So right now we're looking at maybe fiber cement board or something in the durable aspect, but that's still being decided.

102
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:03,053
[SPEAKER_13]: So that is our presentation right now and the drawings as they stand.

103
00:09:05,915 --> 00:09:06,136
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

104
00:09:06,176 --> 00:09:06,776
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks, Jacob.

105
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,518
[SPEAKER_13]: Adam, would you like me to make you host again?

106
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:10,379
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

107
00:09:10,619 --> 00:09:10,939
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

108
00:09:16,521 --> 00:09:17,221
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, everybody.

109
00:09:17,241 --> 00:09:25,025
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to take my brother when I joined the is one of our partners to you want to join the meeting.

110
00:09:27,486 --> 00:09:28,306
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can let him in.

111
00:09:29,046 --> 00:09:31,127
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, you can foster rental.

112
00:09:36,049 --> 00:09:38,770
[SPEAKER_02]: That's an issue the computer so computer like.

113
00:09:39,831 --> 00:09:42,552
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so everyone from the waiting room should be at this point.

114
00:09:46,432 --> 00:09:52,375
[SPEAKER_02]: see if you show up.

115
00:09:52,435 --> 00:09:53,075
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

116
00:09:53,295 --> 00:09:58,658
[SPEAKER_06]: Fernando, Sal, did you want to, I mean, that's essentially the presentation we had from the design side.

117
00:09:58,678 --> 00:10:02,780
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you want to add anything before we start hearing from folks in the neighborhood?

118
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,021
[SPEAKER_14]: This is Sal Caruso.

119
00:10:06,101 --> 00:10:08,182
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm on the development team also, the developer.

120
00:10:08,943 --> 00:10:10,123
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I want to thank Jacob.

121
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:13,725
[SPEAKER_14]: Jacob did a great job in filtrating what we'd like to do there and

122
00:10:14,378 --> 00:10:21,182
[SPEAKER_14]: try to make the building more of, not like the buildings, like you said, down the street with the panel, the metal panels and all that.

123
00:10:21,582 --> 00:10:35,850
[SPEAKER_14]: We'd like to do is maybe some, you know, like siding, body plank siding along those lines and the brickwork and make it a little bit more appealing and not have to worry about one year or three years down the road and not start looking like the building's falling apart, because it is down the street.

124
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:39,832
[SPEAKER_14]: But no, I think Jacob's done a great job in designing this.

125
00:10:40,192 --> 00:10:43,674
[SPEAKER_14]: This is, I think, our fifth time around on design on this.

126
00:10:44,972 --> 00:10:53,077
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we got it down pretty patently now, as long as the neighborhood agrees or likes it, or if there's any changes they would like us to make, we'll get thoughts up.

127
00:10:55,878 --> 00:10:56,058
[SPEAKER_14]: Great.

128
00:10:56,078 --> 00:10:58,300
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks, Sal.

129
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:07,825
[SPEAKER_06]: So with that, I mean, is there anyone from the community or on the Zoom right now that wants to ask any questions or have any comments about the proposal?

130
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:12,467
[SPEAKER_06]: potentially you could just raise your hand or send me a message in the chat function.

131
00:11:13,167 --> 00:11:14,128
[SPEAKER_06]: Barbara, I see you there.

132
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:15,448
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.

133
00:11:15,989 --> 00:11:26,234
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not sure that I'm entirely understanding how many residential units there are versus how many commercial units there are.

134
00:11:30,497 --> 00:11:33,358
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, ma'am.

135
00:11:33,418 --> 00:11:34,399
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's one.

136
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:36,019
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Barbara, for your question.

137
00:11:36,059 --> 00:11:39,881
[SPEAKER_13]: So there's one commercial unit on the on the ground floor.

138
00:11:40,481 --> 00:11:42,382
[SPEAKER_13]: And then there's nine residential units.

139
00:11:44,222 --> 00:11:50,445
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, and do you have any expectation of what type of a commercial unit would go on the ground floor?

140
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:53,398
[SPEAKER_14]: Sal, you want to jump in there?

141
00:11:53,498 --> 00:11:53,678
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

142
00:11:53,918 --> 00:11:56,380
[SPEAKER_14]: We, we're not at that, that stage.

143
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,021
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't know.

144
00:11:57,301 --> 00:11:58,762
[SPEAKER_14]: We want to see what the neighbors would like.

145
00:11:58,782 --> 00:12:09,550
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, one of the, one of the, the, the city members had said, they said, you know something, because of the school, the parents, they want to wait for their children coming out of school.

146
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:12,112
[SPEAKER_14]: So, obviously a coffee shop would be nice.

147
00:12:12,132 --> 00:12:17,016
[SPEAKER_14]: So, something that's catered to parents where they can sit and wait while their children are coming out of school.

148
00:12:17,577 --> 00:12:20,379
[SPEAKER_14]: That was a suggestion from one of the city staff.

149
00:12:20,859 --> 00:12:21,740
[SPEAKER_14]: But we're not sure.

150
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,082
[SPEAKER_14]: It's still open in the air that we haven't figured it out.

151
00:12:24,502 --> 00:12:26,844
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't know what we're going to do with that space.

152
00:12:27,005 --> 00:12:31,348
[SPEAKER_14]: If there's any suggestions that somebody would like to admit, we'd love to listen to it.

153
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:38,435
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I just saw the parking would be for the residential units, but not for the commercial unit.

154
00:12:39,276 --> 00:12:39,616
[SPEAKER_14]: Correct.

155
00:12:40,216 --> 00:12:47,103
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so just to be clear, I'm fairly confident that that stretch of Salem Street from Park Street to

156
00:12:48,143 --> 00:12:57,923
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, probably that brick apartment building that's past where like the little laundry mat is is 15 minutes apart like that is 15 minute parking.

157
00:12:58,707 --> 00:13:10,240
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, that is just something for you all to keep in mind, like, and I know that's the same across the street where like Eddie's places and the hair salon.

158
00:13:11,302 --> 00:13:14,025
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's very, that's short term parking.

159
00:13:14,345 --> 00:13:18,370
[SPEAKER_01]: So I live right on Park Street on the other side of Salem Street.

160
00:13:19,584 --> 00:13:24,545
[SPEAKER_01]: And all day long, we are, you know, we have a lot of that commercial parking.

161
00:13:24,885 --> 00:13:32,087
[SPEAKER_01]: People are going to Eddie's place or going to the hair salon, or there's now a daycare center in that building that they're parked.

162
00:13:32,247 --> 00:13:36,308
[SPEAKER_01]: I can come out of my house in the morning and people are literally blocking my driveway.

163
00:13:36,788 --> 00:13:46,810
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess that that would be my concern that whatever commercial unit goes in there, or if somebody moves into the residential unit and has more than

164
00:13:48,293 --> 00:13:51,475
[SPEAKER_01]: one car, like where are those people going to park?

165
00:13:51,996 --> 00:13:58,360
[SPEAKER_01]: And are they then going to end up on Park Street, which is already brutally hard to find parking because it's only parking on one side.

166
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,121
[SPEAKER_01]: So just some things to keep in mind.

167
00:14:01,402 --> 00:14:02,622
[SPEAKER_01]: Those would be my concerns.

168
00:14:03,043 --> 00:14:08,946
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to see that corner, like something done with it, but parking is a huge concern.

169
00:14:09,547 --> 00:14:09,887
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

170
00:14:11,068 --> 00:14:12,088
[SPEAKER_02]: No consideration, Barbara.

171
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:16,731
[SPEAKER_12]: And I live at

172
00:14:19,596 --> 00:14:20,556
[SPEAKER_12]: 208, which is right across.

173
00:14:21,337 --> 00:14:29,419
[SPEAKER_12]: And that would be my only concern really too, is just like my driveway comes right out into where the parking lot is going to be, where all the entrances are.

174
00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:33,780
[SPEAKER_12]: And then they shut down the road at like three o'clock when the school comes out.

175
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:44,503
[SPEAKER_12]: And yeah, the only thing I would be somewhat interested in seeing is just, you know, the traffic that is going to be coming and going.

176
00:14:50,930 --> 00:15:06,839
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you and part and part of the, as you as you might know part of the site plan review process before the planning and development board, there will be a traffic and a parking component to that so that's the.

177
00:15:09,265 --> 00:15:14,150
[SPEAKER_06]: the developer is going to have to go and get a traffic study done and we're going to have to present it as part of that.

178
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:19,915
[SPEAKER_06]: So that that's definitely something that we've all talked about that we know is an issue that needs to be addressed.

179
00:15:20,295 --> 00:15:23,098
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's not going to be something that we're really guessing.

180
00:15:23,118 --> 00:15:24,399
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not really going to be guesswork.

181
00:15:24,419 --> 00:15:28,223
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll have a traffic study done as part of the initial approval process.

182
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:33,047
[SPEAKER_12]: And not even with the building, but like a lot of parents who come to pick up their kids, they don't even have any like

183
00:15:33,826 --> 00:15:50,063
[SPEAKER_12]: they don't care where they park, they'll park in my driveway, they'll park in front of my road, like, it's like, okay, so it might be, you know, for some of the residents who would live there, a little concerning, but you know, what can you do?

184
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:52,465
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, totally understood.

185
00:15:52,485 --> 00:15:54,387
[SPEAKER_02]: Eunice?

186
00:15:57,211 --> 00:15:58,613
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, yeah, thank you very much.

187
00:15:59,574 --> 00:16:00,755
[SPEAKER_08]: I have two questions.

188
00:16:01,816 --> 00:16:05,920
[SPEAKER_08]: First one may or may not be for developer or the city staff, I'm not sure.

189
00:16:07,161 --> 00:16:10,945
[SPEAKER_08]: But I see 22 people on this zoom.

190
00:16:11,946 --> 00:16:20,795
[SPEAKER_08]: And from my count, I'd say probably a full third of them are either affiliated with the developer or the city.

191
00:16:21,973 --> 00:16:24,216
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, how well was.

192
00:16:25,096 --> 00:16:28,380
[SPEAKER_08]: Was this meeting noticed to the neighborhood at all?

193
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:39,330
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, in any fashion, other than just, you know, a simple, um, You know, posting on the city website, um, you know, was, was the general.

194
00:16:40,371 --> 00:16:45,793
[SPEAKER_08]: neighborhood vicinity personally noticed at all, because it's a bit concerning.

195
00:16:45,853 --> 00:16:58,377
[SPEAKER_08]: It's very concerning, actually, that, you know, there's about 14 people on this Zoom that are not somehow affiliated with the project or the city, and that's not really representative of

196
00:16:59,017 --> 00:17:02,978
[SPEAKER_08]: people that might be concerned with this development.

197
00:17:03,719 --> 00:17:12,122
[SPEAKER_08]: And my second question is, you talked about parking, and you said that you had eight parking spots

198
00:17:12,706 --> 00:17:26,630
[SPEAKER_08]: in the back at the moment, but we'll probably be able to squeeze out nine for the, I think somebody said for the amount of units that you have, one per unit, but then you say that you have 11 units.

199
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:32,171
[SPEAKER_08]: So do you have nine units or do you have 11 units?

200
00:17:32,691 --> 00:17:34,932
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have eight parking spaces, nine, 11?

201
00:17:35,432 --> 00:17:37,953
[SPEAKER_08]: The numbers aren't adding up.

202
00:17:38,633 --> 00:17:38,913
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

203
00:17:39,905 --> 00:17:42,326
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure, let me just clarify on the architecture front.

204
00:17:42,646 --> 00:17:51,990
[SPEAKER_13]: We have nine units, and right now the proposed amount of parking spaces are eight, but we are trying to fit nine parking spaces.

205
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:56,172
[SPEAKER_13]: So the goal is to get a one-in-one parking spot per unit.

206
00:17:56,252 --> 00:17:57,333
[SPEAKER_13]: So there's nine units.

207
00:17:57,913 --> 00:18:03,015
[SPEAKER_13]: Our site plan is showing eight parking spots, and we're gonna try to fit nine parking spots in total.

208
00:18:04,156 --> 00:18:09,298
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, but I think you said something about you had eight one-bedrooms and three two-bedrooms.

209
00:18:10,258 --> 00:18:23,085
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, we have in total, uh, three, two bedrooms and, um, Uh, six, sorry, one bedrooms.

210
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:25,246
[SPEAKER_13]: I misspoke.

211
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:26,606
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, okay.

212
00:18:26,626 --> 00:18:34,830
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause I think the little blurb that you had down the bottom there on what you put up, um, different.

213
00:18:36,932 --> 00:18:38,172
[SPEAKER_13]: It's nine units in total.

214
00:18:39,013 --> 00:18:39,333
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

215
00:18:39,393 --> 00:18:39,673
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

216
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,080
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

217
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:45,621
[SPEAKER_06]: And thanks Jacob and Eunice to your question.

218
00:18:45,701 --> 00:18:57,824
[SPEAKER_06]: So we sent mailings out to, we obtained an abutters list from the city and sent mailers to all abutters within 400 feet.

219
00:18:58,745 --> 00:19:07,467
[SPEAKER_06]: We had posted this on the, the city had posted this on their website and I had provided notice to various departments in town.

220
00:19:07,487 --> 00:19:08,207
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe that

221
00:19:09,107 --> 00:19:12,790
[SPEAKER_06]: the town conduct or the city conducted a reverse 911 on this.

222
00:19:14,831 --> 00:19:16,452
[SPEAKER_06]: I personally, I was on the flyer.

223
00:19:16,552 --> 00:19:21,696
[SPEAKER_06]: I received probably about a dozen emails with people saying that they couldn't attend but wanted more information on it.

224
00:19:21,736 --> 00:19:22,696
[SPEAKER_06]: So we shared the plans.

225
00:19:22,716 --> 00:19:26,939
[SPEAKER_06]: We're also recording this meeting, which I believe will be posted on the city's website.

226
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:33,784
[SPEAKER_06]: And as I mentioned at the outset, this is really the first meeting with the community.

227
00:19:33,864 --> 00:19:35,665
[SPEAKER_06]: We will have at least two

228
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:54,516
[SPEAKER_06]: public hearings before city boards on this, and there very likely will be other opportunities to review our plans and comments so I wouldn't, I wouldn't look at this group as indicative of everyone that at least was notified about it, and there certainly will be other opportunities for people to attend.

229
00:19:55,156 --> 00:19:55,696
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

230
00:19:56,757 --> 00:19:57,057
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

231
00:19:57,722 --> 00:20:12,575
[SPEAKER_09]: Adam if you don't mind I can jump in on that Victor Schrader, economic development director I'm sorry I'm not on video my internet's unstable but yeah reverse 911 call should have gone out I did ask the communications department to do that and we were.

232
00:20:13,696 --> 00:20:19,718
[SPEAKER_09]: Remind me, Adam, we were targeting 400 feet, 300 feet with the notice?

233
00:20:19,738 --> 00:20:21,659
[SPEAKER_06]: 400 feet, yeah.

234
00:20:21,739 --> 00:20:23,959
[SPEAKER_09]: The reverse 911 should have been the same.

235
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:31,462
[SPEAKER_09]: So just for folks that are in the immediate area, you absolutely should have received notice of this.

236
00:20:31,902 --> 00:20:33,863
[SPEAKER_09]: But please let us know if you didn't.

237
00:20:33,963 --> 00:20:34,843
[SPEAKER_09]: We want to know about that.

238
00:20:37,044 --> 00:20:37,644
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Victor.

239
00:20:37,684 --> 00:20:39,605
[SPEAKER_06]: Appreciate that.

240
00:20:40,265 --> 00:20:40,565
[SPEAKER_06]: Cheryl?

241
00:20:42,937 --> 00:20:43,497
[SPEAKER_10]: Good evening.

242
00:20:43,517 --> 00:20:43,557
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi.

243
00:20:44,358 --> 00:20:45,298
[SPEAKER_10]: I live on Park Street.

244
00:20:45,538 --> 00:20:50,040
[SPEAKER_10]: I was in the waiting room and I only got let in when you said, and that concludes our presentation.

245
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,921
[SPEAKER_10]: So that was really helpful.

246
00:20:53,902 --> 00:20:55,542
[SPEAKER_10]: But I didn't get any notice.

247
00:20:55,642 --> 00:21:04,926
[SPEAKER_10]: And since the section of Park Street that you're planning to build on has maybe six parking spaces, and I'm on the next block, your overflow cars will 100% be in my block.

248
00:21:07,336 --> 00:21:09,918
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's pretty important that my neighbors know about it.

249
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:14,341
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a lot of multifamilies in my section that don't all have driveways.

250
00:21:14,381 --> 00:21:16,602
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is going to be a big impact on our lives.

251
00:21:17,342 --> 00:21:27,249
[SPEAKER_10]: And Park, I'm wondering who is letting you believe that one parking space per unit is even feasible in this area because it's not?

252
00:21:29,536 --> 00:21:32,438
[SPEAKER_10]: Our ordinances are for two per unit.

253
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:34,439
[SPEAKER_10]: So one is a really deep dive.

254
00:21:35,139 --> 00:21:40,282
[SPEAKER_10]: And will one of these units be affordable because you're adding nine dense units to our area?

255
00:21:40,302 --> 00:21:45,364
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm just wondering if there's a benefit to the community, to the school.

256
00:21:48,366 --> 00:21:50,207
[SPEAKER_10]: School supply donations every year.

257
00:21:51,565 --> 00:21:57,870
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, yeah, I don't know if Fernando or Sal want to speak to that at this point.

258
00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:04,995
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I don't know that they've determined what the configuration is.

259
00:22:05,055 --> 00:22:09,819
[SPEAKER_06]: But certainly, I mean, parking, traffic, all those things are going to be part of the approval process.

260
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:17,685
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I don't know, Cheryl, if you heard the comments of two of the other folks that were on before, but certainly, you know, parking,

261
00:22:18,645 --> 00:22:23,787
[SPEAKER_06]: it's absolutely understood that it's something that needs to be considered as the project's developed.

262
00:22:24,887 --> 00:22:29,769
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, because I'm just wondering why people would feel that that was an appropriate variance to ask.

263
00:22:29,789 --> 00:22:35,311
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a 50% reduction in parking in a very dense area.

264
00:22:35,351 --> 00:22:38,012
[SPEAKER_10]: And you're going to blot out the sun on that area of Sound Street.

265
00:22:38,032 --> 00:22:41,573
[SPEAKER_10]: We have two mature trees there that I'm sure you're going to tear out.

266
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:44,351
[SPEAKER_14]: No, there are no trees on the site right now.

267
00:22:44,411 --> 00:22:45,532
[SPEAKER_14]: There are no trees whatsoever.

268
00:22:45,632 --> 00:22:47,173
[SPEAKER_10]: No, they're on the city sidewalk.

269
00:22:47,514 --> 00:22:49,215
[SPEAKER_14]: But we're not touching them.

270
00:22:49,255 --> 00:22:50,936
[SPEAKER_14]: We can't touch those more.

271
00:22:50,976 --> 00:22:58,882
[SPEAKER_14]: Number two, if I'm correct, I think the zoning has just changed or it's in the process of changing one car per unit.

272
00:22:59,302 --> 00:23:01,063
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's not the two per one any longer.

273
00:23:01,184 --> 00:23:02,785
[SPEAKER_14]: It's one car per unit.

274
00:23:03,405 --> 00:23:06,928
[SPEAKER_14]: Most of our bedrooms, most of our units are all one bedrooms, not all two.

275
00:23:08,285 --> 00:23:10,807
[SPEAKER_10]: It hasn't changed yet, and it's not going to be one.

276
00:23:10,907 --> 00:23:14,329
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be one and a half, maybe, but it hasn't gone through yet.

277
00:23:15,329 --> 00:23:17,050
[SPEAKER_14]: Jacob, how many two bedrooms we have?

278
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:19,952
[SPEAKER_10]: Doesn't matter.

279
00:23:19,992 --> 00:23:21,853
[SPEAKER_13]: Right now, we have two two bedrooms.

280
00:23:22,253 --> 00:23:23,134
[SPEAKER_14]: Two bedrooms, OK.

281
00:23:23,154 --> 00:23:36,742
[SPEAKER_14]: So our study that we have, there's more and more people taking bicycles on the public T now these days, and not necessarily driving.

282
00:23:37,631 --> 00:23:47,016
[SPEAKER_14]: You, myself, maybe majority of these people still drive, but all the new professionals, young professionals, single families, no children, don't, a lot of them don't drive any longer.

283
00:23:47,036 --> 00:23:51,238
[SPEAKER_14]: A lot of them just have the car, they leave the cars, they look at cars in the parking lot.

284
00:23:51,258 --> 00:23:52,279
[SPEAKER_14]: But that's what we considered.

285
00:23:52,579 --> 00:23:56,061
[SPEAKER_14]: That's how we came to determination of one parking spot per unit.

286
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:58,302
[SPEAKER_14]: Some of these people won't even have cars.

287
00:23:58,962 --> 00:24:07,287
[SPEAKER_14]: I've done enough developments knowing that we've always had more than enough parking, but there's always empty parking spots in the driveway, always in the garage.

288
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:08,093
[SPEAKER_14]: always.

289
00:24:08,894 --> 00:24:13,756
[SPEAKER_14]: So with that said, we, we, we tend to do our parking study.

290
00:24:13,876 --> 00:24:15,057
[SPEAKER_14]: We intend to do all that.

291
00:24:15,197 --> 00:24:19,559
[SPEAKER_14]: We're not going to leave it out there saying, let's, well, let's see what happens.

292
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:23,981
[SPEAKER_14]: And if it goes from there, we, that's one of our assignments that we're going to be doing.

293
00:24:24,121 --> 00:24:26,223
[SPEAKER_14]: We have to do that for the zoning board.

294
00:24:27,183 --> 00:24:34,827
[SPEAKER_10]: So would you be willing to deed restrict on no cars from that building will be allowed to get permits and park on the street.

295
00:24:35,725 --> 00:24:40,666
[SPEAKER_10]: that they're doing that in South Boston when they're short of parking.

296
00:24:41,447 --> 00:24:42,627
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a good point.

297
00:24:43,087 --> 00:24:44,567
[SPEAKER_14]: Do they have permit parking over there?

298
00:24:45,928 --> 00:24:47,348
[SPEAKER_10]: They will once you come.

299
00:24:48,208 --> 00:24:50,689
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, it's not out of the question.

300
00:24:51,789 --> 00:24:56,711
[SPEAKER_10]: Sections of sections of our Medford does permit parking currently by street.

301
00:24:57,231 --> 00:25:00,592
[SPEAKER_10]: They're looking at doing it by zone and

302
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:09,651
[SPEAKER_10]: Intentionally shorting your parking, rolling the dice that your units won't have cars, then you should bear the burden and not the neighborhood.

303
00:25:10,092 --> 00:25:16,533
[SPEAKER_10]: You should deed restrict your tenants owners from ever getting permit parking.

304
00:25:18,133 --> 00:25:19,013
[SPEAKER_10]: The express bus here.

305
00:25:19,053 --> 00:25:21,974
[SPEAKER_10]: So a lot more people are getting cars because the T cut our bus.

306
00:25:24,734 --> 00:25:25,074
[SPEAKER_06]: Victor.

307
00:25:25,114 --> 00:25:26,955
[SPEAKER_06]: I see, I see your, your, your hands raised.

308
00:25:26,975 --> 00:25:28,395
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you want to comment?

309
00:25:30,937 --> 00:25:33,280
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I just wanted to clarify on the zoning.

310
00:25:34,141 --> 00:25:38,826
[SPEAKER_09]: Cheryl's right, the new zoning ordinance is not in effect yet.

311
00:25:38,946 --> 00:25:44,072
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it will be when this project applies for relief.

312
00:25:50,399 --> 00:25:59,667
[SPEAKER_09]: The current zoning ordinance or the new zoning ordinances as drafted is 1.5 parking spaces per unit.

313
00:26:00,607 --> 00:26:02,229
[SPEAKER_09]: So the project will need to seek relief.

314
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:13,578
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll be by special permit, not variance, but that'll be part of the relief that they'll need to seek from either the zoning board or community development board.

315
00:26:15,139 --> 00:26:15,339
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

316
00:26:15,379 --> 00:26:16,000
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, Victor.

317
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,161
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just trying to go in order here.

318
00:26:18,302 --> 00:26:18,542
[SPEAKER_06]: Alex,

319
00:26:20,275 --> 00:26:20,775
[SPEAKER_06]: Your hand raised.

320
00:26:24,076 --> 00:26:24,536
[SPEAKER_00]: Alex?

321
00:26:24,696 --> 00:26:25,236
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, sorry.

322
00:26:25,256 --> 00:26:25,736
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sorry.

323
00:26:26,377 --> 00:26:27,697
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry I'm not on video.

324
00:26:27,817 --> 00:26:30,457
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm holding a baby, so kind of multitasking here.

325
00:26:30,477 --> 00:26:31,338
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

326
00:26:31,898 --> 00:26:43,461
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I actually was just going to kind of bounce on one of the comments that Cheryl said, which was my main question or thought about this development is for affordable units.

327
00:26:43,901 --> 00:26:48,722
[SPEAKER_00]: I just would strongly, strongly encourage you all to do whatever you could to

328
00:26:49,402 --> 00:26:55,088
[SPEAKER_00]: add some units potentially so that we could be past the 10 unit threshold for inclusionary zoning.

329
00:26:55,528 --> 00:27:02,195
[SPEAKER_00]: That new law went into play, it's still pretty new in 2019, and really hasn't been taken advantage of at all.

330
00:27:02,515 --> 00:27:08,441
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would really, really like to see more developers taking advantage of that.

331
00:27:08,521 --> 00:27:11,924
[SPEAKER_00]: So personally, parking, your comment about

332
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:17,803
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, young folks taking bus and bike definitely resonated with me.

333
00:27:17,823 --> 00:27:25,532
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I have a young family, we have two kids, we're a one car family, we have a cargo bike, we love it.

334
00:27:26,213 --> 00:27:27,515
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do think that that is

335
00:27:28,381 --> 00:27:30,403
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, becoming more and more of a thing.

336
00:27:30,463 --> 00:27:32,284
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm really happy to see that too.

337
00:27:32,344 --> 00:27:49,017
[SPEAKER_00]: So parking is not my number one concern, but I would think for, you know, for Medford as a whole, uh, really, really wanting to see that inclusionary zoning be taken advantage of more so we can provide more below market rate units as well as market rate, because they both, you know, that's a benefit to the city of Medford, um, just as a whole.

338
00:27:49,077 --> 00:27:51,019
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's, that's my, my biggest thing.

339
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:53,340
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

340
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:53,621
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

341
00:27:53,661 --> 00:27:54,081
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks Alex.

342
00:27:54,101 --> 00:27:55,222
[SPEAKER_06]: We appreciate it.

343
00:27:57,123 --> 00:27:57,884
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, Jamie.

344
00:27:59,275 --> 00:28:02,696
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I was just going to sort of go off some of that.

345
00:28:03,176 --> 00:28:10,598
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I don't know the ordinances and like if 10 units is better than nine or what that means.

346
00:28:11,118 --> 00:28:17,700
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, ideally, if people, everyone takes bus, you know, buses and cars, and that's great.

347
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:24,341
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, not less, but I don't know necessarily if more is something I want them right across the street.

348
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:26,702
[SPEAKER_12]: But I will say that

349
00:28:27,517 --> 00:28:34,162
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, the parking is the biggest issue, obviously, but that area was sort of an eyesore for a long time.

350
00:28:34,222 --> 00:28:41,366
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm hoping that this does sort of boost up value and does do good for a lot of the people who live around here.

351
00:28:41,967 --> 00:28:55,356
[SPEAKER_12]: So, you know, do I want to see construction all day and stuff like that, but that just comes with it and the parking, but hopefully it benefits us in the long run with increasing the value of the area.

352
00:28:58,564 --> 00:28:58,744
[SPEAKER_12]: Great.

353
00:28:58,764 --> 00:28:59,565
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks, Jamie.

354
00:28:59,585 --> 00:29:01,107
[SPEAKER_06]: Appreciate it.

355
00:29:01,127 --> 00:29:01,567
[SPEAKER_06]: Navar?

356
00:29:01,587 --> 00:29:04,871
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi there, William Navar.

357
00:29:04,891 --> 00:29:08,895
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I wanted to say something similar to what Alex said.

358
00:29:09,275 --> 00:29:10,517
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's really great that

359
00:29:11,139 --> 00:29:17,383
[SPEAKER_07]: the city's going to be able to welcome five, sorry, nine new households as neighbors.

360
00:29:17,763 --> 00:29:19,044
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's a wonderful thing.

361
00:29:19,464 --> 00:29:31,991
[SPEAKER_07]: I think one of the wonderful things about building housing here in the city as opposed to out in, you know, Billerica or something is that's going to give people the chance to live without a car, which is something that people really value nowadays.

362
00:29:32,692 --> 00:29:33,873
[SPEAKER_07]: And a lot of people,

363
00:29:34,753 --> 00:29:38,354
[SPEAKER_07]: feel they're forced to own a car because they can't afford housing close to the city.

364
00:29:38,834 --> 00:29:43,376
[SPEAKER_07]: And this, I think, is going to be a real benefit to us if we have more people living here in the city.

365
00:29:44,936 --> 00:29:48,117
[SPEAKER_07]: Because people that live out of the city drive their cars through our city.

366
00:29:48,438 --> 00:29:50,138
[SPEAKER_07]: We're what's known as a cut-through town.

367
00:29:51,218 --> 00:29:55,720
[SPEAKER_07]: So when we send people to Billerica, they come back and drive through.

368
00:29:57,913 --> 00:30:11,429
[SPEAKER_07]: As for the amount of units, I think it would be really great, and I think it's important to note that the City Council really did, one of the reasons they're settling at 1.5 spaces per unit,

369
00:30:13,612 --> 00:30:18,795
[SPEAKER_07]: is because there's going to be a provision that you won't need a variance to reduce the parking.

370
00:30:19,115 --> 00:30:20,856
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll be able to use special permit.

371
00:30:21,237 --> 00:30:30,042
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's one of the reasons they're OK with leaving it even so high as 1.5, is that it's easier than it was before to knock that down.

372
00:30:30,542 --> 00:30:37,166
[SPEAKER_07]: They were thinking to do a 1.2, and they said, OK, let's do 1.5 with the understanding that a special permit knocks that down.

373
00:30:37,186 --> 00:30:39,167
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's deliberate.

374
00:30:39,187 --> 00:30:40,168
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not a loophole.

375
00:30:41,088 --> 00:30:43,391
[SPEAKER_07]: As for the number of units, I would love to see more.

376
00:30:44,432 --> 00:30:53,664
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be really good if you could get inclusionary zoning, 10 units or more, put another floor on there, welcome a couple more neighbors, one of them affordable.

377
00:30:53,764 --> 00:30:55,406
[SPEAKER_07]: I would really love to see that.

378
00:30:56,945 --> 00:31:01,368
[SPEAKER_07]: And if if there are certain reasons regulatory why you can't do that.

379
00:31:02,408 --> 00:31:25,160
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd be open to open to hearing about that because you know our our City Council and everything really wants rules that make it so people can do this community need so just as a helpful thing to the community and it can be really great if if there's a good if there's a reason that's not possible because the rules are something just let us know that we can learn from that going forward and advocate for things to make to make that situation better going forward.

380
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:25,720
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks.

381
00:31:27,503 --> 00:31:29,044
[SPEAKER_06]: Great, thanks so much, appreciate it.

382
00:31:31,625 --> 00:31:33,746
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyone else with any questions, comments?

383
00:31:36,046 --> 00:31:56,835
[SPEAKER_14]: If I may, the idea of the fourth floor did come across our desk at the time, and I think in that particular zoning, I think we have the right to go four stories, but I thought, and we had a long discussion about this, I think the majority of the neighbors would know

384
00:31:57,705 --> 00:31:59,587
[SPEAKER_14]: like that idea of going four stories.

385
00:32:00,468 --> 00:32:02,491
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, we don't mind inclusionary housing.

386
00:32:02,531 --> 00:32:04,453
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, you know, this is what we do it all the time.

387
00:32:04,973 --> 00:32:09,078
[SPEAKER_14]: And the nine units we have there now are just the right size.

388
00:32:09,138 --> 00:32:16,587
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, if we went another story and, you know, Jacob, can you tell us, what are your thoughts on another story and how many units you can put in there?

389
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:17,880
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure.

390
00:32:19,341 --> 00:32:19,762
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure.

391
00:32:19,902 --> 00:32:24,985
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, obviously, one issue with going higher is there's the height limit in Medford.

392
00:32:25,405 --> 00:32:27,866
[SPEAKER_13]: So that'd be some relief you'd be asking for there.

393
00:32:28,167 --> 00:32:32,509
[SPEAKER_13]: So the current 35 foot height limit is being achieved with this design.

394
00:32:32,589 --> 00:32:40,234
[SPEAKER_13]: So by adding another story, we'd probably do a similar floor plan and get another, you know, maybe four units in there, which we have per floor.

395
00:32:40,954 --> 00:32:48,220
[SPEAKER_13]: So you would go, you know, maybe 45 feet, which is going to be taller than the building across the street.

396
00:32:49,121 --> 00:32:51,643
[SPEAKER_13]: But there are some taller buildings in the area.

397
00:32:52,044 --> 00:32:56,988
[SPEAKER_13]: But having said that, you could add another four units if you just added another story on top.

398
00:32:57,328 --> 00:33:01,212
[SPEAKER_13]: But it would be something we would want to look at also the shadows that would be cast

399
00:33:01,912 --> 00:33:10,516
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's another parking concern where if you add another four units, you know, one of the reasons we were trying to hit nine units was because of the parking issue.

400
00:33:10,936 --> 00:33:13,877
[SPEAKER_13]: So we've been the goal has been a one in one.

401
00:33:14,277 --> 00:33:15,898
[SPEAKER_13]: And we think that's a good ratio.

402
00:33:15,918 --> 00:33:17,839
[SPEAKER_13]: I know it's a really challenging site.

403
00:33:18,419 --> 00:33:21,621
[SPEAKER_13]: So having one in one is beneficial.

404
00:33:21,961 --> 00:33:26,443
[SPEAKER_13]: But if you add another four units in there, it's going to be hard to add more parking.

405
00:33:26,483 --> 00:33:31,425
[SPEAKER_13]: You're going to start shrinking that commercial space on the first floor if we want to start adding more parking.

406
00:33:31,805 --> 00:33:43,954
[SPEAKER_13]: The next thing you know the whole building is going to be up on people say, and you're going to lose the entire corner there on Park Street and Salem Street, so we could try to go up to, you know, to be at another for you.

407
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:55,133
[SPEAKER_13]: option for maybe go back to rooms and try to expand the floor plate in that realm.

408
00:33:55,433 --> 00:34:03,118
[SPEAKER_13]: But talking to the town earlier, we thought it was a good mix of having two beds and one bed is really a need for the city in the sweet spot.

409
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:11,504
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

410
00:34:13,085 --> 00:34:13,625
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Jacob.

411
00:34:17,515 --> 00:34:17,795
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

412
00:34:17,896 --> 00:34:20,680
[SPEAKER_06]: Any, any, any other thoughts, comments, questions.

413
00:34:24,927 --> 00:34:30,357
[SPEAKER_06]: About, uh, uh, any, anyone from the city, Victor and anything before we wrap up here.

414
00:34:33,984 --> 00:34:36,566
[SPEAKER_09]: No, Adam, thanks for presenting today.

415
00:34:36,586 --> 00:34:41,989
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, the purpose of these meetings is to hear from neighbors before an application is submitted.

416
00:34:42,009 --> 00:34:44,690
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you all for coming out.

417
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:50,813
[SPEAKER_09]: And we hope that the developer will take your comments into consideration.

418
00:34:50,953 --> 00:34:56,717
[SPEAKER_09]: And please, you know, continue to show up as this project goes through the process.

419
00:34:56,837 --> 00:34:58,938
[SPEAKER_09]: And thank you for your time.

420
00:35:00,016 --> 00:35:00,777
[SPEAKER_06]: Great, thank you, Victor.

421
00:35:00,797 --> 00:35:01,437
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate that.

422
00:35:01,737 --> 00:35:04,379
[SPEAKER_06]: Looks like we have one hand raised from Ann Sullivan.

423
00:35:05,339 --> 00:35:06,120
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, I'm sorry.

424
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,261
[SPEAKER_11]: I also did not get to see the presentation.

425
00:35:08,361 --> 00:35:11,523
[SPEAKER_11]: I came in a little bit late and was not able to get on right away.

426
00:35:12,044 --> 00:35:15,346
[SPEAKER_11]: So I can't really comment because I have not seen the design.

427
00:35:15,826 --> 00:35:22,330
[SPEAKER_11]: But the building across the street from it, the corner of Park and Salem, I believe it's called the Potter building, is very unique.

428
00:35:22,911 --> 00:35:25,492
[SPEAKER_11]: You drive down Salem Street and you notice it right away.

429
00:35:25,532 --> 00:35:26,833
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a three story building.

430
00:35:27,033 --> 00:35:27,394
[SPEAKER_11]: It has

431
00:35:28,454 --> 00:35:53,200
[SPEAKER_11]: an interesting roofline and whatever and is there any design element that takes a look at what is offered on that side of the street so there's almost like a balance rather than putting up a modern you know very different kind of building and then across the street you have this lovely brick building with you know a sort of a angled entrance and all of that I mean

432
00:35:54,545 --> 00:35:57,233
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't get to see the design, so I have no.

433
00:35:57,755 --> 00:36:01,767
[SPEAKER_13]: yeah can you can you make me host again at a really quick door.

434
00:36:02,127 --> 00:36:02,647
[SPEAKER_11]: That'd be great.

435
00:36:02,687 --> 00:36:02,907
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

436
00:36:02,947 --> 00:36:03,827
[SPEAKER_11]: And I apologize.

437
00:36:04,007 --> 00:36:05,228
[SPEAKER_11]: No problem, Anne.

438
00:36:05,268 --> 00:36:07,908
[SPEAKER_13]: We absolutely love the Potter building across the street.

439
00:36:07,948 --> 00:36:11,429
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's been a huge influence on what we've been designing.

440
00:36:11,929 --> 00:36:14,790
[SPEAKER_13]: So I just need to wait to become host.

441
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:17,150
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'll show you kind of our rendering in 3D view here.

442
00:36:18,850 --> 00:36:21,231
[SPEAKER_13]: We think that building is absolutely gorgeous.

443
00:36:21,291 --> 00:36:30,773
[SPEAKER_13]: And compared to some of the things that have been being built down the street, we want to definitely play off our neighbor across the street with the detailing, the window trim, the bump outs, the brickwork.

444
00:36:31,093 --> 00:36:32,133
[SPEAKER_13]: That's yeah great.

445
00:36:32,213 --> 00:36:33,774
[SPEAKER_13]: That is absolutely gorgeous.

446
00:36:35,454 --> 00:36:41,977
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm the host now so just give me a quick second here I'm going to share my screen, and hopefully you can see this rendering we've been working on.

447
00:36:42,697 --> 00:36:48,719
[SPEAKER_13]: So, if you could see the trim here in all this detail, we want to do something very similar.

448
00:36:49,139 --> 00:36:54,901
[SPEAKER_13]: to the Salem street side where we have these bump outs and even on the park side we want to do these.

449
00:36:55,061 --> 00:36:55,381
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

450
00:36:55,881 --> 00:37:07,085
[SPEAKER_13]: We want to the brick work on the first floor we want to do our best to try to match the combination of the yellow brick on the lower end and the higher red brick light brick on the top do some sort of blend on the lower end.

451
00:37:07,485 --> 00:37:12,150
[SPEAKER_13]: We want to keep the same kind of rough opening scale on the first floor, that is, on the second floor.

452
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:18,896
[SPEAKER_13]: We want to play with the banding that they have on the roof deck and on the middle part too, as you can kind of see here.

453
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:23,781
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to take you to these axons really quick so you can kind of see a little bit more 3D.

454
00:37:24,041 --> 00:37:28,405
[SPEAKER_13]: That building is a high influence on us, so it's definitely something we're taking in consideration.

455
00:37:28,465 --> 00:37:30,708
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, we're still early in the project, obviously.

456
00:37:31,208 --> 00:37:34,590
[SPEAKER_13]: But 100%, we love that.

457
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:37,212
[SPEAKER_12]: And these aren't the finished color schemes or anything, right?

458
00:37:37,232 --> 00:37:39,873
[SPEAKER_12]: This is just sort of your initial design.

459
00:37:39,953 --> 00:37:40,854
[SPEAKER_13]: No, no.

460
00:37:40,914 --> 00:37:43,796
[SPEAKER_13]: By no means are these the finished color schemes.

461
00:37:44,156 --> 00:37:54,662
[SPEAKER_13]: We're just trying to show the idea is going to have a contrast of colors and play on what's across the street.

462
00:37:54,902 --> 00:37:55,963
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a little challenging.

463
00:37:55,983 --> 00:37:57,424
[SPEAKER_13]: They used this green there.

464
00:37:57,504 --> 00:37:59,085
[SPEAKER_13]: So we don't want to really match that.

465
00:37:59,593 --> 00:38:00,534
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

466
00:38:00,814 --> 00:38:06,340
[SPEAKER_13]: And we still want to have a little bit of modern, you know, we don't want to look like something we're trying to copy from the past.

467
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:11,565
[SPEAKER_13]: So this corner in the front, which we're still working on, is going to be a huge opportunity for us.

468
00:38:17,932 --> 00:38:20,534
[SPEAKER_13]: I got a little bit of background noise there.

469
00:38:20,734 --> 00:38:22,395
[SPEAKER_13]: I hope that answers your question a little bit.

470
00:38:22,415 --> 00:38:23,656
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, thank you.

471
00:38:24,397 --> 00:38:26,098
[SPEAKER_11]: I missed the beginning, so thank you very much.

472
00:38:26,118 --> 00:38:27,579
[SPEAKER_11]: I have one other question for you.

473
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:40,649
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm listening to some of the abutting neighbors talking about parking, and I noticed that on number 237 Park Street, which is almost two doors down from this building, it is up for sale now,

474
00:38:41,737 --> 00:38:46,524
[SPEAKER_11]: which might be a tear down and which might be another proposed development.

475
00:38:48,747 --> 00:38:55,716
[SPEAKER_11]: And has anyone been aware of that, that the house further down the street?

476
00:39:05,719 --> 00:39:07,060
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think we lost you there for a moment.

477
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:12,462
[SPEAKER_11]: OK, I think I was muted there.

478
00:39:12,482 --> 00:39:14,703
[SPEAKER_11]: 237 Park Street is up for sale right now.

479
00:39:15,623 --> 00:39:22,166
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's I'm listening to the neighbors talking about parking, which is right across the street from the school and how difficult it is.

480
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:30,049
[SPEAKER_11]: And it looks like it might be a teardown and it might be another multi multi use spot.

481
00:39:30,569 --> 00:39:31,130
[SPEAKER_05]: Has anyone

482
00:39:32,524 --> 00:39:37,308
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, looked at the timing of, of developing that property while this was going up.

483
00:39:37,328 --> 00:39:44,994
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.

484
00:39:59,104 --> 00:40:15,776
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you're still with us in, I don't know that that particular property is, I mean, it's certainly on our radar, but I don't know that there was much consideration to what could be developed there currently, considering it's current use.

485
00:40:16,757 --> 00:40:23,682
[SPEAKER_06]: Although if that's incorrect, Fernando or Sal, if you have anything else to add to that, please feel free.

486
00:40:23,782 --> 00:40:27,785
[SPEAKER_06]: I was gonna say you could make a parking lot out of it.

487
00:40:31,657 --> 00:40:43,800
[SPEAKER_04]: We did try to purchase the other, talk to the neighbors on the side of the property to buy the other properties and try to enlarge the building or get more units or get more parking, but that didn't work.

488
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:47,561
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's pretty stupid, the same play that we have.

489
00:40:48,221 --> 00:40:49,981
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, thank you.

490
00:40:50,822 --> 00:40:56,923
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, great, thanks.

491
00:40:58,544 --> 00:41:04,989
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, well, yeah, and just to echo, uh, Victor's comments, I do want to say, you know, thanks so much for everyone who came out.

492
00:41:05,349 --> 00:41:12,734
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, this is the beginning of, of, of a conversation relative to this, um, this proposal.

493
00:41:13,474 --> 00:41:24,542
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, you know, my, my contact information was included on the, uh, the handout, uh, and the poster, but my email is ARB at R I W.com.

494
00:41:30,692 --> 00:41:38,038
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think that everyone here will certainly be hearing from us as things progress.

495
00:41:38,198 --> 00:41:40,200
[SPEAKER_06]: And thank you again all for your comments.

496
00:41:41,581 --> 00:41:44,043
[SPEAKER_06]: And with that, have a great night.

497
00:41:44,183 --> 00:41:45,144
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll all speak soon.

498
00:41:45,164 --> 00:41:46,244
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, everybody.

499
00:41:46,285 --> 00:41:46,905
[SPEAKER_06]: Really quick.

500
00:41:47,385 --> 00:41:50,528
[SPEAKER_13]: Adam, everybody, this meeting was recorded.

501
00:41:50,748 --> 00:41:57,894
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you didn't make it to the beginning, you have an opportunity to go back and look at us walking through this.

502
00:41:58,274 --> 00:41:59,155
[SPEAKER_13]: And thank you, everybody.

503
00:42:00,552 --> 00:42:01,056
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, everybody.

504
00:42:01,318 --> 00:42:01,560
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
