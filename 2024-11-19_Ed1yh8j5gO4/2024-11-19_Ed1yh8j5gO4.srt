60
00:03:29,067 --> 00:03:38,051
[SPEAKER_26]: So at 101, he was a member of the bicentennial community for the city of Medford seven years ago, and outstanding member of the community.

61
00:03:38,071 --> 00:03:44,335
[SPEAKER_26]: At 101, I want to wish him a happy birthday, and hope he lives another 100 more years.

62
00:03:44,415 --> 00:03:46,736
[SPEAKER_26]: And I know he'll survive this pandemic also.

00:06:23,968 --> 00:06:24,769
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, how's that?

183
00:06:25,489 --> 00:06:26,510
[SPEAKER_12]: Am I still echoing?

184
00:06:27,991 --> 00:06:29,552
[SPEAKER_04]: It's much better.

185
00:06:29,713 --> 00:06:31,614
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think you're good to begin.

186
00:06:32,275 --> 00:06:32,655
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

187
00:06:34,817 --> 00:06:35,197
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

188
00:06:36,518 --> 00:06:37,939

00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:41,622
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to just grab a different device real quick.

00:06:41,862 --> 00:06:42,923

00:08:55,228 --> 00:08:57,650
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you ready to present?

247
00:09:01,092 --> 00:09:01,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, she's muted.

248
00:09:02,172 --> 00:09:03,113
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I try unmuting you now?

249
00:09:03,133 --> 00:09:06,735
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, is that better?

250
00:09:06,935 --> 00:09:07,656
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, much better.

251
00:09:07,696 --> 00:09:07,976
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

252
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,600
[SPEAKER_06]: I apologize.

253
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,161
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a nurse.

254
00:09:10,241 --> 00:09:12,721
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not an IT guy.

255
00:09:13,022 --> 00:09:15,442
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for letting me grab a different device.

256
00:09:15,723 --> 00:09:16,143
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

257
00:09:16,163 --> 00:09:20,364
[SPEAKER_04]: So just if I may really quick, this is 20-570.

258
00:09:20,804 --> 00:09:23,385
[SPEAKER_04]: This is an update on Lawrence Memorial Hospital.

259
00:09:24,106 --> 00:09:24,586
[SPEAKER_04]: Sue Sandberg.

260
00:09:25,486 --> 00:09:25,986
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

261
00:09:26,006 --> 00:09:27,227
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening.

262
00:09:27,387 --> 00:09:39,554
[SPEAKER_05]: And for those of you who have not had the pleasure to meet yet, I am Sue Sandberg and I am CEO for Melrose Wakefield Healthcare, including Melrose Wakefield Hospital and Lawrence Memorial Hospital.

263
00:09:40,314 --> 00:09:47,719
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you, Mr. President and honorable council members for the opportunity to be here with you tonight.

264
00:09:48,599 --> 00:09:55,801
[SPEAKER_05]: I am happy to see all of you, even if virtually, and happy to see that everyone is safe and healthy.

265
00:09:57,401 --> 00:10:06,204
[SPEAKER_05]: In planning for tonight's presentation, it was startling to realize that it has been a year since we last presented before this council.

266
00:10:07,304 --> 00:10:15,286
[SPEAKER_05]: It was last October when we received unanimous approval for the special permit for the development of the ambulatory surgery center.

267
00:10:16,835 --> 00:10:30,345
[SPEAKER_05]: Since that time, we have all experienced the significant impact of the coronavirus pandemic and the disruption it has had on our lives, our businesses, and our families.

268
00:10:31,386 --> 00:10:41,513
[SPEAKER_05]: The once-in-a-century pandemic put to test the clinical foundation of our healthcare system, and proudly, we responded without fail.

269
00:10:42,354 --> 00:10:45,516
[SPEAKER_05]: Along with our peers and colleagues throughout the state,

270
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:48,532
[SPEAKER_05]: in caring for our patients and our communities.

271
00:10:49,772 --> 00:11:04,101
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm pleased to say that even with the significant challenges posed by COVID, construction of the ambulatory surgery center and renovations to the Lawrence Memorial Hospital lobby continued.

272
00:11:05,301 --> 00:11:14,367
[SPEAKER_05]: More than ever, we are excited about what the ambulatory surgery center means for patients and the community as we catalyst to transforming the campus.

273
00:11:15,649 --> 00:11:22,294
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to take this opportunity to provide you with a brief summary of what has been our response to the pandemic.

274
00:11:23,796 --> 00:11:44,753
[SPEAKER_05]: At the start of the outbreak, which now feels like a lifetime ago, our clinical and operational leaders, led by our chief medical officer, who was also an emergency medicine physician, instituted incident command to operationalize and oversee our organization's response.

275
00:11:45,902 --> 00:12:12,824
[SPEAKER_05]: The group met daily, each morning, to discuss and plan for key elements of our response, such as operations, including monitoring bed availability, staffing, supplies, planning and logistics, including coordinating with state and federal agencies throughout, and bringing forward innovative solutions, such as our ability to produce our own hand sanitizer.

276
00:12:14,437 --> 00:12:41,503
[SPEAKER_05]: We also coordinated efforts daily with Tufts Medical Center and Lowell General Hospital Circle Health as our welfare partners to ensure that we had safe, appropriate levels of PPE throughout the system, that our patients were being cared for in the best and most appropriate environment, and that we had access to ICU beds and ventilators when needed.

277
00:12:43,197 --> 00:12:49,539
[SPEAKER_05]: And when Remdesivir became available, we were one of the first in the state to receive a shipment.

278
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:57,361
[SPEAKER_05]: And we coordinated distribution of the treatment to be sure it was dispersed appropriately to all who needed it.

279
00:12:58,921 --> 00:13:01,042
[SPEAKER_05]: We had contingency planning in place.

280
00:13:01,742 --> 00:13:06,183
[SPEAKER_05]: We set up additional areas to be used as patient care areas if needed.

281
00:13:07,014 --> 00:13:15,216
[SPEAKER_05]: And staff were cross-trained to support those areas, including medical assistants, physician assistants, and even surgeons.

282
00:13:16,497 --> 00:13:35,102
[SPEAKER_05]: We took a tremendous leap forward in our capabilities to provide telemedicine visits for physicians and their patients, thanks in part to appropriate relaxation of regulations by state and federal agencies, which we hope will continue.

283
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:50,596
[SPEAKER_05]: At the Lawrence Memorial campus specifically, we had no interruption of urgent care services, which we continue to offer at the most extended hours in the area, from 7 a.m.

284
00:13:50,676 --> 00:13:51,697
[SPEAKER_05]: to 11 p.m.

285
00:13:51,737 --> 00:13:52,137
[SPEAKER_05]: daily.

286
00:13:53,257 --> 00:14:06,244
[SPEAKER_05]: We set up drive-through testing in coordination with state planning and our medical staff, and ensured availability of testing for our patients, and also for our region's first responders.

287
00:14:07,642 --> 00:14:14,204
[SPEAKER_05]: Testing is conducted seven days a week, and to date we have performed more than 6,000 tests.

288
00:14:15,184 --> 00:14:20,946
[SPEAKER_05]: And we continue to safely care for our geriatric inpatient behavioral health patients.

289
00:14:21,766 --> 00:14:33,029
[SPEAKER_05]: And thankfully, due to comprehensive testing and admission processes established by our teams, we have prevented COVID from spreading in that unit to date.

290
00:14:34,609 --> 00:14:36,330
[SPEAKER_05]: Lastly, and proudly,

291
00:14:37,065 --> 00:14:43,171
[SPEAKER_05]: our School of Nursing successfully and safely graduated its students with little delay.

292
00:14:44,132 --> 00:14:54,522
[SPEAKER_05]: The school responded proactively with changes in schedules and curriculum at the first talk of the outbreak and put our students at an advantage.

293
00:14:54,542 --> 00:15:00,848
[SPEAKER_05]: 300 students went completely online within one week's time in March.

294
00:15:01,957 --> 00:15:13,142
[SPEAKER_05]: all eligible students graduated on time, and ultimately they passed their licensure exams this summer at rates significantly higher than the state average.

295
00:15:14,563 --> 00:15:23,307
[SPEAKER_05]: And now with the start of a new school year, the school is conducting a mix of remote and in-person learning with staggered classes.

296
00:15:24,636 --> 00:15:33,400
[SPEAKER_05]: The school's plan, including contract tracing models, have been approved by the city and by the State Department of Public Health.

297
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:54,031
[SPEAKER_05]: All the safety precautions that were developed for the protection of patients and staff at the height of the outbreak, including separate areas in the emergency department for COVID care, and inpatient isolation units for COVID positive patients,

298
00:15:54,910 --> 00:16:01,314
[SPEAKER_05]: as well as universal masking and pre-procedure and pre-admission testing remain.

299
00:16:02,435 --> 00:16:10,720
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to emphasize it is safe and appropriate to receive care in our hospitals and in our physician offices.

300
00:16:12,021 --> 00:16:20,366
[SPEAKER_05]: It's important that our patients and communities know they should not delay the care they need due to fear of COVID.

301
00:16:20,996 --> 00:16:24,980
[SPEAKER_05]: and to contact their physicians with questions or concerns.

302
00:16:26,121 --> 00:16:39,513
[SPEAKER_05]: And I also want to thank you, our local leaders, and our local businesses, our neighbors, and our communities for the overwhelming expressions of support you gave our caregivers.

303
00:16:40,754 --> 00:16:46,500
[SPEAKER_05]: It meant so much to all of us during the most difficult and trying times of the outbreak

304
00:16:47,449 --> 00:16:57,133
[SPEAKER_05]: And we thank you for the sacrifices you all made during the height of the surge to help flatten the curve at the times they were most needed.

305
00:16:58,093 --> 00:17:09,658
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been very difficult for so many, but your efforts truly made a difference and have had a positive impact on disrupting the spread of the virus.

306
00:17:10,678 --> 00:17:16,921
[SPEAKER_05]: For that, we are grateful and know we will continue to respond to this pandemic together.

307
00:17:18,004 --> 00:17:33,587
[SPEAKER_05]: And with that summary, tonight we will be providing you with an update on the ambulatory surgery center development and the lobby renovations, including an update on the construction timeline and our continued vision for the campus.

308
00:17:34,847 --> 00:17:36,767
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you again for your time this evening.

309
00:17:36,787 --> 00:17:43,769
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm pleased to turn over the presentation to Ryan Fuller, our strategic planner and development leader.

310
00:17:44,389 --> 00:17:44,649
[SPEAKER_05]: Ryan.

311
00:17:46,889 --> 00:17:47,970
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Sue.

312
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:50,972
[SPEAKER_18]: For the record, Ryan Fuller, 170 Governors Avenue.

313
00:17:51,372 --> 00:17:52,512
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm from Massachusetts.

314
00:17:53,633 --> 00:17:59,157
[SPEAKER_18]: Pleasure to be back speaking to the Council and to all the residents watching on Zoom.

315
00:17:59,697 --> 00:18:03,920
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to try and share my screen because we do have a few slides to share.

316
00:18:10,824 --> 00:18:13,906
[SPEAKER_18]: So can I get a thumbs up if a comment about working people?

317
00:18:16,377 --> 00:18:17,518
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, President Falco.

318
00:18:17,558 --> 00:18:17,878
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

319
00:18:18,619 --> 00:18:28,047
[SPEAKER_18]: So as Sue alluded to, we thought it was important to tell the council and everyone listening that our vision for this campus remains the same.

320
00:18:29,088 --> 00:18:32,070
[SPEAKER_18]: We are transforming care at Lawrence Memorial Hospital.

321
00:18:32,651 --> 00:18:35,133
[SPEAKER_18]: This is the same slide that we gave a year ago today.

322
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:43,460
[SPEAKER_18]: And we couldn't be even more excited about where this vision is taking us, because the changes in the industry have continued to

323
00:18:45,062 --> 00:18:50,290
[SPEAKER_18]: We're really excited about where we're going with the campus.

324
00:18:51,412 --> 00:18:53,836
[SPEAKER_18]: So our vision is to transform care.

325
00:18:53,856 --> 00:18:58,503
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're here in Medford and caring for the residents of Medford and a greater region for the next 100 years.

326
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:04,419
[SPEAKER_18]: a little bit.

327
00:19:04,459 --> 00:19:06,020
[SPEAKER_18]: It's to talk about patients.

328
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:26,441
[SPEAKER_18]: to have the most extensive hours in their region, open 7 days to 11 days a week.

329
00:19:27,821 --> 00:19:30,662
[SPEAKER_18]: Last month, we averaged just about 48 patients a day there.

330
00:19:30,702 --> 00:19:33,082
[SPEAKER_18]: So we continue to see an increase in volume there.

331
00:19:35,163 --> 00:19:39,564
[SPEAKER_18]: Some for COVID testing through our drive-thru, but mostly people actually coming in as well.

332
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,241
[SPEAKER_18]: was a transition that we have had made.

333
00:19:46,821 --> 00:19:51,904
[SPEAKER_18]: But the important thing we want to talk about is our anchor tenant in our transformation, and that's the surgery center.

334
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:56,066
[SPEAKER_18]: And we're nearing completion of that and excited to share some details there.

335
00:19:56,606 --> 00:20:00,508
[SPEAKER_18]: It really is one of the new services coming to the state of Massachusetts.

336
00:20:00,528 --> 00:20:02,409
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to be early on in this, and I

337
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:04,190
[SPEAKER_18]: care.

338
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:05,753
[SPEAKER_18]: It's something that is

339
00:20:17,087 --> 00:20:18,568
[SPEAKER_18]: just stop at the ASC.

340
00:20:19,069 --> 00:20:22,851
[SPEAKER_18]: ASC is our anchor tenant, but also the catalyst for additional programs coming in.

341
00:20:23,892 --> 00:20:33,418
[SPEAKER_18]: So some of our specialists that will be performing surgery there are going to also be seeing patients there in terms of what the Fedex ear, nose, and throat, gastro, GI.

342
00:20:34,259 --> 00:20:41,763
[SPEAKER_18]: And then with those specialties, you start to have ancillary services like physical therapy, internal medicine, and our women's health program.

343
00:20:42,544 --> 00:20:44,685
[SPEAKER_18]: Looking forward to planning that

344
00:20:47,654 --> 00:20:48,495
[SPEAKER_18]: that we're going to be able to do that.

345
00:20:48,515 --> 00:20:49,175
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to be able to do that.

346
00:20:49,195 --> 00:20:50,516
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to be able to do that.

347
00:20:50,556 --> 00:20:51,397
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to be able to do that.

348
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:52,298
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to be able to do that.

349
00:20:52,318 --> 00:20:53,199
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to be able to do that.

350
00:20:53,219 --> 00:20:54,059
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to be able to do that.

351
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:55,180
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to be able to do that.

352
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,101
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to be able to do that.

353
00:20:56,201 --> 00:20:56,922
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to be able to do that.

354
00:20:56,942 --> 00:20:57,903
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to be able to do that.

355
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:58,643
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to be able to do that.

356
00:20:58,723 --> 00:20:59,564
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to be able to do that.

357
00:20:59,604 --> 00:21:00,425
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to be able to do that.

358
00:21:00,445 --> 00:21:01,145
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to be able to do that.

359
00:21:01,165 --> 00:21:01,926
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to be able to do that.

360
00:21:01,946 --> 00:21:02,907
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to be able to do that.

361
00:21:03,587 --> 00:21:04,288
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to be able to do that.

362
00:21:04,308 --> 00:21:04,968
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to be able to do that.

363
00:21:04,988 --> 00:21:06,009
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to be able to do that.

364
00:21:06,029 --> 00:21:06,890
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to be able to do that.

365
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:07,651
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to be able to do that.

366
00:21:07,671 --> 00:21:08,051
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going

367
00:21:08,371 --> 00:21:12,695
[SPEAKER_18]: the city of and they are very excited about where we're

368
00:21:28,428 --> 00:21:37,096
[SPEAKER_18]: So talking specifically about the surgery center, we are on schedule despite all the new challenges posed by COVID-19 for all stakeholders.

369
00:21:38,238 --> 00:21:41,561
[SPEAKER_18]: That's not just us, all of us have had to change our lives because of it.

370
00:21:42,902 --> 00:21:52,291
[SPEAKER_18]: We have implemented COVID-19 safety protocols in coordination with the City of Medford Health Department and proud to say we've had zero positive cases on the job site.

371
00:21:53,749 --> 00:21:59,750
[SPEAKER_18]: We have continued our community engagement with our acute community advisory group meetings, or what we call our CAG.

372
00:22:00,571 --> 00:22:03,671
[SPEAKER_18]: Doing those via Zoom now, like everyone else, being appropriate.

373
00:22:04,212 --> 00:22:14,014
[SPEAKER_18]: And we continue to send our community email updates whenever we have something large happening on the campus, something that we need to get communication out, or just general updates.

374
00:22:14,434 --> 00:22:17,815
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's something we're going to continue to do throughout the rest of the project.

375
00:22:19,534 --> 00:22:20,916
[SPEAKER_18]: construction is almost complete.

376
00:22:29,172 --> 00:22:30,612
[SPEAKER_18]: to be completed by the end of the calendar year.

377
00:22:30,632 --> 00:22:31,372
[SPEAKER_18]: We're hoping to

378
00:23:01,837 --> 00:23:07,222
[SPEAKER_18]: So one thing we wanted to explain to the council today was a change that we had.

379
00:23:07,322 --> 00:23:15,609
[SPEAKER_18]: And part of this is a change because of the great process that you go through in collecting feedback from various city departments and stakeholders.

380
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:19,753
[SPEAKER_18]: So one of the changes we have is in our roof screen.

381
00:23:20,393 --> 00:23:22,794
[SPEAKER_18]: you'll see an existing mechanical unit.

382
00:23:22,974 --> 00:23:34,818
[SPEAKER_18]: And you'll recall the big change that was a win for everyone was moving the ASC inside the existing structure and renovating inside the current campus.

383
00:23:35,959 --> 00:23:37,879
[SPEAKER_18]: So this was kind of pre-construction from a view.

384
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:46,903
[SPEAKER_18]: We had an 11-foot high building, a 14-foot high mechanical unit that has been there for quite some time, I think in the early 80s, when that building was put on.

385
00:23:48,348 --> 00:23:50,689
[SPEAKER_18]: this location.

386
00:23:51,749 --> 00:23:56,310
[SPEAKER_18]: Our intent was to to try and hide that mechanical unit as best we could.

387
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:59,851
[SPEAKER_18]: So this is the first we had was a 9 foot coming up from where the wall was today.

388
00:24:18,633 --> 00:24:21,596
[SPEAKER_18]: to the roof or anything that happens in the building.

389
00:24:22,217 --> 00:24:23,538
[SPEAKER_18]: It was a 9 foot high parapet.

390
00:24:23,578 --> 00:24:25,440
[SPEAKER_18]: Again, that mechanical unit was a bit higher.

391
00:24:26,642 --> 00:24:32,848
[SPEAKER_18]: But because of elevation changes, we thought this was going to cover most of the mechanical unit and provide something.

392
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:34,950
[SPEAKER_18]: But again, it wasn't going to be safe for everyone.

393
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:36,932
[SPEAKER_18]: And we happily made that change.

394
00:24:38,174 --> 00:24:40,736
[SPEAKER_18]: We went to an unconnected screen idea.

395
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:43,211
[SPEAKER_18]: This is actually when last year it was screens.

396
00:25:00,367 --> 00:25:02,208
[SPEAKER_18]: it was not going to be feasible for all of our first responders.

397
00:25:02,248 --> 00:25:08,771
[SPEAKER_18]: It was not going to be feasible when we took into account the wind load and the structural engineering component.

398
00:25:09,231 --> 00:25:19,375
[SPEAKER_18]: It was getting away from actually blocking that mechanical unit, again, because of the height of it, and to allow safe access in the period when our civil engineers got involved.

399
00:25:20,216 --> 00:25:21,516
[SPEAKER_18]: It was not going to be feasible.

400
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:27,319
[SPEAKER_18]: We actually had to move them in further than what was presented here based on, again, additional feedback.

401
00:25:27,339 --> 00:25:28,960
[SPEAKER_18]: And it was not going to work.

402
00:25:30,165 --> 00:25:34,048
[SPEAKER_18]: So we landed on the current thinking or rendering three.

403
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:38,873
[SPEAKER_18]: We think this is a great place to land on.

404
00:25:39,553 --> 00:25:46,219
[SPEAKER_18]: Again, our intent was to try and blend in or hide that mechanical unit that you see here.

405
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:52,205
[SPEAKER_18]: So this is trying to blend it in from an eye perspective with the rest of the campus behind you.

406
00:25:53,249 --> 00:25:56,930
[SPEAKER_18]: We feel like this is true to the intent of what we're trying to achieve.

407
00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:03,551
[SPEAKER_18]: We have communicated this to our CAG, and we sent a community email out about this change.

408
00:26:03,591 --> 00:26:09,732
[SPEAKER_18]: And we also fliered everyone on the opposite side of Governor's Ave today explaining that this change was happening.

409
00:26:10,852 --> 00:26:20,534
[SPEAKER_18]: And received really good feedback from a good number of residents that we talked to today around the idea and where the campus is going in the direction.

410
00:26:23,428 --> 00:26:25,110
[SPEAKER_18]: So what you see is kind of 3 different colors that we put

411
00:26:43,149 --> 00:26:43,850
[SPEAKER_18]: for information.

412
00:26:44,431 --> 00:26:47,514
[SPEAKER_18]: I will continue to make that final selection and that in the coming weeks.

413
00:26:47,574 --> 00:26:47,995
[SPEAKER_18]: But we think

414
00:26:59,982 --> 00:27:04,105
[SPEAKER_18]: So with that, that was one change we wanted to come back and tell you about.

415
00:27:04,445 --> 00:27:09,108
[SPEAKER_18]: We also have some very exciting news as it relates to particular community funding.

416
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:12,851
[SPEAKER_18]: So Lori Howley from our team is actually going to speak about that.

417
00:27:13,671 --> 00:27:17,374
[SPEAKER_18]: So if we can unmute her, I don't want to do something myself here.

418
00:27:17,394 --> 00:27:20,797
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, Lori, I'm trying to unmute you now.

419
00:27:23,458 --> 00:27:23,979
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, Lori.

420
00:27:23,999 --> 00:27:24,619
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

421
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:25,720
[SPEAKER_12]: Hello, everyone.

422
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:26,761
[SPEAKER_12]: Can you hear me okay?

423
00:27:27,221 --> 00:27:27,401
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

424
00:27:28,729 --> 00:27:29,910
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, well, thank you.

425
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:31,110
[SPEAKER_12]: It's Lori Howley.

426
00:27:31,571 --> 00:27:37,934
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm Executive Director of Corporate Communications, and I also oversee Community Relations and Community Benefits.

427
00:27:38,495 --> 00:27:42,177
[SPEAKER_12]: For the record, my address 170 Governors Ave in Medford.

428
00:27:43,426 --> 00:27:43,847
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

429
00:27:43,927 --> 00:27:44,768
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, everyone.

430
00:27:44,988 --> 00:27:49,753
[SPEAKER_12]: It's really nice to be here with you again and to see you even virtually.

431
00:27:49,953 --> 00:27:54,497
[SPEAKER_12]: And I want to just echo Sue's comments and hope everyone is safe and well.

432
00:27:55,578 --> 00:28:06,489
[SPEAKER_12]: Just very quickly, we wanted to bring back to this group and to remind everybody that another benefit of the Ambulatory Surgery Center is the allocation of community funding.

433
00:28:08,131 --> 00:28:17,878
[SPEAKER_12]: This is an opportunity that comes through the DPH in partnership with health care providers and approved DON projects.

434
00:28:18,778 --> 00:28:25,623
[SPEAKER_12]: That allows us and states the opportunity to earmark a percentage of the projects

435
00:28:26,283 --> 00:28:36,725
[SPEAKER_12]: cost to put aside for grant funding for community groups throughout the greater, for Medford and the greater Medford area.

436
00:28:37,085 --> 00:28:54,588
[SPEAKER_12]: So what's exciting about this is it really makes available a significant amount of funding to help support community goals and DPH goals that address causes of health disparities

437
00:28:55,680 --> 00:29:04,943
[SPEAKER_12]: and for resources, programs, agencies, services that promote health equity through policy, system, environmental changes.

438
00:29:05,023 --> 00:29:14,006
[SPEAKER_12]: So really dollars that help get to the root cause of what we, again, is what we talk about is health disparities in our area.

439
00:29:15,771 --> 00:29:25,560
[SPEAKER_12]: So this, an RFP, these fundings just became the process, I should say, for accessing or applying for these funds was just last week.

440
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:36,430
[SPEAKER_12]: So September 30th, an RFP went out and is being promoted in the Medford area, in the greater Medford area and the surrounding communities.

441
00:29:38,173 --> 00:29:44,536
[SPEAKER_12]: $475,000 plus dollars are available to support grant funding to support health initiatives.

442
00:29:45,337 --> 00:29:47,238
[SPEAKER_12]: This money is dispersed over 4 years.

443
00:29:48,708 --> 00:30:00,875
[SPEAKER_12]: You can see it's open to non-profit organization, public entities, municipalities, schools, health institutions, based, like I said, in and around Medford.

444
00:30:01,796 --> 00:30:11,441
[SPEAKER_12]: There is a comprehensive, how this process works is under the guidelines of DPH on their established protocols.

445
00:30:13,022 --> 00:30:16,765
[SPEAKER_12]: a comprehensive RFP process has been developed.

446
00:30:17,286 --> 00:30:28,494
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a multi sort of a representation of an allocation committee, including strong representation from Medford.

447
00:30:29,475 --> 00:30:32,357
[SPEAKER_12]: Specifically, Mr. Neil Osborne is on the committee.

448
00:30:32,377 --> 00:30:33,338
[SPEAKER_12]: Ms.

449
00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:35,540
[SPEAKER_12]: Marianna O'Connor is on the committee.

450
00:30:36,338 --> 00:30:39,601
[SPEAKER_12]: community advocate, Loretta Kemp is on the committee.

451
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:45,385
[SPEAKER_12]: We have actually a local resident who's also an employee, Amanda Nemi is on the committee.

452
00:30:45,485 --> 00:30:59,776
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're excited about what this means in terms of being able to fund important initiatives over the next four years that come directly as a result of the approval of this project.

453
00:31:00,731 --> 00:31:01,492
[SPEAKER_12]: to the city Council.

454
00:31:01,572 --> 00:31:08,957
[SPEAKER_12]: And I want to everybody who might be listening tonight and you think you might want apply for grant funding.

455
00:31:08,977 --> 00:31:11,219
[SPEAKER_12]: We encourage you to do so.

456
00:31:11,659 --> 00:31:16,723
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a link on the Melrose Wakefield dot org slash RFP.

457
00:31:16,783 --> 00:31:23,068
[SPEAKER_12]: And we can email that link out to the City Council so you can have it available on your

458
00:31:29,155 --> 00:31:29,416
[SPEAKER_12]: this project.

459
00:31:29,436 --> 00:31:31,580
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think it's an opportunity that has come with

460
00:31:39,653 --> 00:31:41,133
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, very much.

461
00:31:41,313 --> 00:31:48,335
[SPEAKER_18]: So just one final slide here, just to bring it back from a timeline perspective for the Surgery Center.

462
00:31:49,295 --> 00:31:58,798
[SPEAKER_18]: The landscaping plan that was part of it, the landscape plan for the project we anticipate to implement this season, so and be completed with that in fall of 2020.

463
00:32:00,058 --> 00:32:10,148
[SPEAKER_18]: That is inclusive of the fence installation that the community and the neighbors voted on in terms of closing the current gap near Joyce Road that will be installed in fall of 2020.

464
00:32:12,143 --> 00:32:15,525
[SPEAKER_18]: our new lobby entrance will be open to employees right now.

465
00:32:15,565 --> 00:32:18,447
[SPEAKER_18]: They are going through, employees are going through a temporary entrance.

466
00:32:19,808 --> 00:32:25,892
[SPEAKER_18]: And we will have, we will install our ADA accessible ramp from Governor's Avenue in November as well.

467
00:32:26,872 --> 00:32:31,015
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're very excited about bringing additional accessibility to the campus there.

468
00:32:32,296 --> 00:32:36,678
[SPEAKER_18]: Our special permit items, our requirements, we anticipate to be completed

469
00:32:39,901 --> 00:32:54,766
[SPEAKER_18]: We as I stated previously, I should say on the special permit items and completing those, we are in close contact with the mayor's office in City Hall and coordinating those efforts and we again anticipate to finish those up by December.

470
00:32:55,828 --> 00:32:56,168
[SPEAKER_18]: in January.

471
00:32:56,208 --> 00:33:00,651
[SPEAKER_18]: And then the 4 to coming back to this Council in the and hopefully rotation of 6 month

472
00:33:19,284 --> 00:33:21,065
[SPEAKER_18]: So with that, that's the end of our presentation.

473
00:33:21,085 --> 00:33:28,211
[SPEAKER_18]: And thank you for the opportunity to provide an update on what we think is an exciting project to bring additional care to the residents in there.

474
00:33:28,371 --> 00:33:29,692
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

475
00:33:29,752 --> 00:33:30,693
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, thank you.

476
00:33:30,713 --> 00:33:32,234
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Marks.

477
00:33:33,193 --> 00:33:40,676
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President, and I want to thank Ryan and Sue for their detailed presentation.

478
00:33:41,536 --> 00:33:44,357
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a couple of questions, Mr. President.

479
00:33:45,237 --> 00:33:55,441
[SPEAKER_02]: One, if maybe we can get back to that first rendering of the building and the screening that was discussed by Ryan.

480
00:33:57,681 --> 00:33:58,122
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, sir.

481
00:33:58,162 --> 00:33:58,882
[SPEAKER_22]: Pulling that up now.

482
00:33:58,902 --> 00:33:59,242
[SPEAKER_22]: One second.

483
00:34:12,517 --> 00:34:13,037
[SPEAKER_19]: This one, sir?

484
00:34:14,698 --> 00:34:20,040
[SPEAKER_02]: The screening itself, so that's the initial concept, right?

485
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,181
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, sir.

486
00:34:21,661 --> 00:34:25,963
[SPEAKER_02]: And that can't be accomplished because of concerns with the fire department, is that correct?

487
00:34:27,563 --> 00:34:28,904
[SPEAKER_18]: Correct, yes, sir.

488
00:34:29,464 --> 00:34:35,567
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, and the second rendering, that one right there.

489
00:34:35,807 --> 00:34:40,829
[SPEAKER_02]: So the unconnected screens, what was the reasoning why this couldn't be accomplished?

490
00:34:42,876 --> 00:34:47,919
[SPEAKER_18]: to be pushed back even further than what was anticipated here based on that additional feedback.

491
00:34:47,939 --> 00:34:55,062
[SPEAKER_18]: So it needed to be, I believe it was 10 feet back from the edge of the roof line, plus 4 feet of down the mechanical unit.

492
00:34:55,082 --> 00:35:05,427
[SPEAKER_18]: So when you factored that into what was actually going to be needed for height to block the mechanical unit, it was getting away from the original purpose of trying to block that unit.

493
00:35:05,487 --> 00:35:06,828
[SPEAKER_18]: And then it also wasn't structurally possible.

494
00:35:08,075 --> 00:35:22,063
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so I guess the concerns that I've received, Ryan, just so you know, is that I guess what the hospital's pushing for is to actually just paint the electrical box, is that correct?

495
00:35:23,844 --> 00:35:28,849
[SPEAKER_18]: Our intent is to try and blend it in as much as we can with the rest of the building, and that's what you see in the current record.

496
00:35:29,009 --> 00:35:37,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, but clearly there's a huge difference, aesthetically speaking, from your initial proposal to this current rendering here.

497
00:35:37,878 --> 00:35:41,762
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can see why area residents would have some concern with that.

498
00:35:42,483 --> 00:35:49,973
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any way to make the exterior, I can appreciate the fact that our fire department may need access and so forth.

499
00:35:50,493 --> 00:35:54,158
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't want to block access or go against their recommendations.

500
00:35:54,659 --> 00:35:57,843
[SPEAKER_02]: But is there any way we can make this more aesthetically pleasing?

501
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:05,049
[SPEAKER_02]: Because right now it just looks like a giant gray, what I would refer to as icebox.

502
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:10,754
[SPEAKER_02]: And the exterior of the building looks beautiful, the frontage.

503
00:36:11,434 --> 00:36:14,216
[SPEAKER_02]: And that, in my opinion, sticks out like a sore thumb.

504
00:36:14,757 --> 00:36:27,387
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was hoping that maybe the hospital can circle the wagons back and come out with a couple more renderings on other alternatives to just painting that icebox.

505
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:35,152
[SPEAKER_02]: that would be aesthetically pleasing for the neighbors and something that I think would fit into the new construction.

506
00:36:35,593 --> 00:36:39,335
[SPEAKER_02]: So if that's something that the hospital can do, can you speak to that?

507
00:36:40,696 --> 00:36:45,200
[SPEAKER_18]: Sure, Councilor Marks and Jeff Lucia, please jump in if I missed anything.

508
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,842
[SPEAKER_18]: Jeff is on the more technical side of things.

509
00:36:49,483 --> 00:36:52,245
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I wanted to jump to this slide, Councilor Marks.

510
00:36:52,325 --> 00:36:53,106
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it shows

511
00:36:54,056 --> 00:37:01,740
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, on the left-hand side, the pre-construction, there was a true icebox, you know, a big silver mechanical unit.

512
00:37:02,861 --> 00:37:05,182
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, what we have now is still a construction project.

513
00:37:05,722 --> 00:37:13,186
[SPEAKER_18]: On the right-hand side, there'll still be a lot of landscaping plan put in, the flagpole, et cetera, which will soften that.

514
00:37:13,406 --> 00:37:16,828
[SPEAKER_18]: But we have three different options in terms of a paint color.

515
00:37:20,302 --> 00:37:20,822
[SPEAKER_18]: you know, it's it's

516
00:37:38,563 --> 00:37:44,126
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, so why can't we put some type of screening right onto that mechanical box?

517
00:37:45,147 --> 00:37:59,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Something that's aesthetically pleasing like the second proposal or maybe some type of building material that could be affixed to the box itself rather than just painting it.

518
00:37:59,374 --> 00:38:01,456
[SPEAKER_02]: because your initial plan, I'm sure,

519
00:38:02,796 --> 00:38:08,638
[SPEAKER_02]: was costing tens of thousands of dollars, if not hundreds of thousands of dollars to cover that up.

520
00:38:09,318 --> 00:38:17,660
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure why we can't take a look at putting something else there that would be pleasing to the neighbors and Director Butters.

521
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:30,024
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would ask that that be taken into consideration and that you provide a couple of more proposals other than just the painting of the electrical box itself.

522
00:38:39,309 --> 00:38:39,889
[SPEAKER_18]: like this idea.

523
00:38:54,713 --> 00:38:59,035
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not sure if you can hear me.

524
00:39:21,144 --> 00:39:21,404
[SPEAKER_18]: you know,

525
00:39:37,102 --> 00:39:43,326
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I'd appreciate it if you can work on that with the CAG group, as well as area residents.

526
00:39:44,306 --> 00:39:52,291
[SPEAKER_02]: My second question is regarding the exterior of the building, and in particular, the bottom lower part of the building itself.

527
00:39:53,072 --> 00:39:58,055
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any renderings of that?

528
00:40:00,296 --> 00:40:01,397
[SPEAKER_18]: Where do you mean, Councilor Marks?

529
00:40:01,417 --> 00:40:03,038
[SPEAKER_18]: I apologize.

530
00:40:04,399 --> 00:40:06,060
[SPEAKER_02]: So the front of the building there,

531
00:40:08,408 --> 00:40:12,030
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, now the other rendering, the other construction.

532
00:40:13,011 --> 00:40:16,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that a wood slat there, or is that brick?

533
00:40:18,575 --> 00:40:24,919
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, so that is a, we'll defer to Jeff if we can get him unmuted.

534
00:40:25,539 --> 00:40:28,381
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a terracotta material.

535
00:40:28,441 --> 00:40:34,565
[SPEAKER_18]: What we wanted to do here was to try and find something that is in the same complimentary

536
00:40:37,561 --> 00:40:41,883
[SPEAKER_18]: the same color, but also show something that is new.

537
00:40:42,084 --> 00:40:45,325
[SPEAKER_18]: Again, modern without being way too modern.

538
00:40:45,385 --> 00:40:54,610
[SPEAKER_18]: Modern in terms of we want to be here delivering care for the next 100 years, but something that also blends in with the campus and the existing structure that is there today.

539
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:57,452
[SPEAKER_18]: So it is a terrifying sighting in the same family.

540
00:41:01,274 --> 00:41:07,139
[SPEAKER_02]: So is it like a brick master, like a terracotta that's carved in?

541
00:41:08,059 --> 00:41:08,900
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what that is?

542
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:19,048
[SPEAKER_18]: Jeff, I think you're unmuted.

543
00:41:19,368 --> 00:41:22,290
[SPEAKER_18]: Do you hear Councilor Mark's last question?

544
00:41:24,892 --> 00:41:25,473
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me find him.

545
00:41:30,036 --> 00:41:30,697
[SPEAKER_04]: Ryan, it's Jeff.

546
00:41:30,717 --> 00:41:31,097
[SPEAKER_04]: He's here.

547
00:41:34,105 --> 00:41:37,087
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm having some technical difficulties there.

548
00:41:37,768 --> 00:41:41,010
[SPEAKER_18]: So Council Member, can you just repeat that one more time?

549
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:41,870
[SPEAKER_18]: I apologize for that.

550
00:41:42,931 --> 00:41:44,152
[SPEAKER_02]: You said it was a terracotta.

551
00:41:44,172 --> 00:42:00,183
[SPEAKER_02]: I was wondering if it's similar to like a simulated brick master where they put a layer of cement down and then carve the design that they want to carve into the terracotta or cement, whatever the substance is.

552
00:42:02,526 --> 00:42:02,946
[SPEAKER_18]: No, sir.

553
00:42:03,027 --> 00:42:08,148
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a panel system that is on clips.

554
00:42:08,168 --> 00:42:09,888
[SPEAKER_18]: They're not a brick master.

555
00:42:10,849 --> 00:42:12,329
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the intent to look like brick?

556
00:42:12,689 --> 00:42:13,469
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that the intent?

557
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:16,230
[SPEAKER_18]: No, sir.

558
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:17,471
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't think so, sir.

559
00:42:17,531 --> 00:42:27,794
[SPEAKER_18]: I think what we're trying to achieve is something that would show something that is different from today, while also blending in something that's complementary in the same palette.

560
00:42:29,154 --> 00:42:29,254
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

561
00:42:30,911 --> 00:42:37,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, it doesn't blend in much to me, but if that's what you guys arrived at, that's fine.

562
00:42:38,215 --> 00:42:45,039
[SPEAKER_02]: My other point I have is regarding, as you know, Ryan, you've been involved with this since day one.

563
00:42:45,059 --> 00:42:57,966
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the direct abutters going up Governor's Ave, there was a lot of discussion in the back of your parking lot, the second lot, regarding fencing, shrubbery, trees.

564
00:42:58,467 --> 00:43:00,088
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that was part of your presentation.

565
00:43:00,768 --> 00:43:08,271
[SPEAKER_02]: The home at 216 Governor's Ave has completely no barrier at all from your parking lot.

566
00:43:09,031 --> 00:43:20,475
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was originally under the impression when we were looking at providing a barrier between the neighbors, whether it was plantings or fencing, that that was part of the project.

567
00:43:20,956 --> 00:43:29,819
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they not going to put fencing next to 216 Governor's Ave, which would separate your parking lot, a very busy parking lot,

568
00:43:30,279 --> 00:43:31,380
[SPEAKER_02]: from the residents.

569
00:43:42,028 --> 00:43:44,910
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not sure if that's what you're talking about.

570
00:44:09,649 --> 00:44:14,470
[SPEAKER_18]: As of today, actually, so we have talked to, you know, we did get him added to our list, sir.

571
00:44:14,831 --> 00:44:17,271
[SPEAKER_18]: We've talked with him specifically as our closest neighbor.

572
00:44:17,691 --> 00:44:19,112
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to continue to engage with him.

573
00:44:19,132 --> 00:44:21,272
[SPEAKER_18]: But right now, the plan is to not extend that fence.

574
00:44:21,773 --> 00:44:22,013
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

575
00:44:22,653 --> 00:44:26,334
[SPEAKER_02]: I would ask respectfully, Lawrence Memorial has been great during this process.

576
00:44:26,734 --> 00:44:27,674
[SPEAKER_02]: We've come a long way.

577
00:44:28,174 --> 00:44:35,757
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would ask in the interest of being a good neighbor that I believe it's roughly 100 feet of fence.

578
00:44:37,657 --> 00:44:54,508
[SPEAKER_02]: that Lawrence Memorial make a commitment to extend that fence so we don't have a neighbor that's completely open to headlights and noise and everything else that's going to be associated with the parking lot.

579
00:44:55,169 --> 00:45:07,377
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would ask that Lawrence Memorial make a commitment to work with the neighbor at 216 to put up a fence, a barrier, in the interest of being a good neighbor.

580
00:45:10,719 --> 00:45:11,899
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's what we're trying to do.

581
00:45:38,314 --> 00:45:42,798
[SPEAKER_18]: So we will continue to work with that individual specifically.

582
00:45:43,519 --> 00:45:46,502
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so I take that that sounds like that you will put a fence up.

583
00:45:46,522 --> 00:45:52,828
[SPEAKER_18]: A commitment to talk with him and see what is feasible.

584
00:45:54,301 --> 00:45:56,022
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I appreciate that.

585
00:45:56,482 --> 00:45:59,644
[SPEAKER_02]: And just my last point, I know my colleagues have questions also.

586
00:46:00,625 --> 00:46:13,171
[SPEAKER_02]: During this entire process, some of the concerns within the neighborhood and the direct abutters was speeding cars, additional signage, pedestrian crossings.

587
00:46:15,073 --> 00:46:21,158
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know much of which involves city input, the traffic commission, the police department.

588
00:46:21,559 --> 00:46:33,189
[SPEAKER_02]: Has there been any steps with Lawrence Memorial Hospital and the Method Police Department or Traffic Commission to work on some of these concerns regarding speeding and pedestrian safety?

589
00:46:44,772 --> 00:46:47,695
[SPEAKER_18]: and finalizing those plans that are coming together.

590
00:46:47,715 --> 00:46:52,439
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're appreciative of the coordination, collaboration with the city departments on that.

591
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:58,725
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's what I was alluding to, those things will be finished by the, wrapped up by December timeframe.

592
00:46:59,967 --> 00:47:08,215
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, and do you have anything you could publicly share with us at a later date on what's being proposed and what's being worked on?

593
00:47:11,443 --> 00:47:12,444
[SPEAKER_18]: you know, we take direction

594
00:47:25,418 --> 00:47:26,099
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

595
00:47:26,439 --> 00:47:26,799
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

596
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:27,960
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

597
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:29,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

598
00:47:29,982 --> 00:47:30,903
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Mr. President.

599
00:47:30,923 --> 00:47:32,384
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Ryan and Sue.

600
00:47:33,505 --> 00:47:37,609
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you for your commitment to the community during this COVID crisis here.

601
00:47:37,669 --> 00:47:47,257
[SPEAKER_26]: And I myself and my family have had the opportunity to use services at Morell's Wakefield during this, not by choice, but

602
00:47:48,218 --> 00:47:50,599
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you for the care you've given my family up there.

603
00:47:51,019 --> 00:48:01,243
[SPEAKER_26]: One of the questions I've got for some of the residents is, you have that dirt piled up on the corner of Lawrence and Governance.

604
00:48:01,704 --> 00:48:07,166
[SPEAKER_26]: Is that going to stay there, or is that going back up on the project, or is that going to be removed at some point?

605
00:48:08,783 --> 00:48:10,224
[SPEAKER_18]: have a question for you.

606
00:48:30,373 --> 00:48:31,794
[SPEAKER_18]: this is an additional a lot of people.

607
00:48:59,076 --> 00:49:06,604
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, so that'll be staying there, and it'll be leveled off at some point, and some type of grass will be planted there.

608
00:49:07,465 --> 00:49:18,938
[SPEAKER_26]: As far as the, maybe this goes to Sue, the rest of the campus, any vision on, any word on any more physicians coming into the campus?

609
00:49:24,868 --> 00:49:26,589
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to unmute you right now.

610
00:49:26,689 --> 00:49:27,709
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, Susan, you're on.

611
00:49:27,789 --> 00:49:28,190
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

612
00:49:28,750 --> 00:49:32,672
[SPEAKER_06]: As we said, the surgery center will be built, and then we'd start on that.

613
00:49:32,712 --> 00:49:34,472
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, there is interest.

614
00:49:34,552 --> 00:49:38,254
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think Ryan gave you a preview of some of the first groups.

615
00:49:39,535 --> 00:49:41,756
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I'm not giving away any secrets.

616
00:49:41,816 --> 00:49:48,579
[SPEAKER_05]: When Larry Conway came to the city council and said he was coming back to Medford, he's going to be him.

617
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:52,961
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's also now bringing his partner, as Ryan said, Dr. David Crystal on.

618
00:49:53,914 --> 00:49:56,277
[SPEAKER_05]: So they have both started work in Medford.

619
00:49:56,317 --> 00:50:00,041
[SPEAKER_05]: They're starting at our building at 101 Main.

620
00:50:00,502 --> 00:50:06,869
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they will move into the new medical village as we get that built for them.

621
00:50:06,949 --> 00:50:10,934
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's some more cardiology physicians joining them.

622
00:50:10,994 --> 00:50:13,457
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a little teaser for you as this starts.

623
00:50:13,971 --> 00:50:22,456
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, I did get to see Dr. Conway and I was happy to see him come back to MedFed and talk about an icon in the community, it's Larry.

624
00:50:23,016 --> 00:50:26,378
[SPEAKER_05]: He's so excited, he is so excited.

625
00:50:27,259 --> 00:50:40,246
[SPEAKER_26]: And again, I just wanted to thank you for what you've done for the community during this COVID crisis and hopefully this will be coming to a completion soon and you'll be serving more members of the community.

626
00:50:42,637 --> 00:50:43,879
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Vice President Caraviello.

627
00:50:45,142 --> 00:50:46,384
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other questions from the council?

628
00:50:51,274 --> 00:50:51,975
[SPEAKER_27]: Mr. President, if I may?

629
00:50:52,516 --> 00:50:53,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Council Knight.

630
00:50:54,867 --> 00:51:03,090
[SPEAKER_27]: Mr. President, I just want to take an opportunity to thank Sue and her team from Melrose Wakefield Hospital, the Newton name that they're going by now.

631
00:51:03,430 --> 00:51:12,834
[SPEAKER_27]: But they've done a great job in responding to the council's inquiries, the council's concerns, and always being ready and available to come here to address this body when we have issues.

632
00:51:12,874 --> 00:51:15,275
[SPEAKER_27]: So I do want to thank them and commend them for the work that they've done.

633
00:51:15,795 --> 00:51:21,677
[SPEAKER_27]: And I look forward to working through some of the design issues that we have and the construction issues that we're having in the neighborhood between now and our next meeting.

634
00:51:22,483 --> 00:51:23,304
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

635
00:51:23,504 --> 00:51:30,308
[SPEAKER_04]: And if I may, Sue, if I may, you mentioned a second ago, you said Medical Village.

636
00:51:30,748 --> 00:51:34,250
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess this is more of a branding question.

637
00:51:34,290 --> 00:51:37,613
[SPEAKER_04]: So do we know, is it going to be called the Medical Village, Medical Campus?

638
00:51:38,013 --> 00:51:39,434
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have any update on that?

639
00:51:40,494 --> 00:51:44,377
[SPEAKER_05]: We're working on the branding right now, so stay tuned.

640
00:51:44,737 --> 00:51:49,180
[SPEAKER_05]: But we are working, you've heard, call it Medical Village, so that's what I'm calling it right now.

641
00:51:49,818 --> 00:51:53,719
[SPEAKER_05]: but we're working on a branding with a branding consultant right now.

642
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:54,479
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

643
00:51:55,079 --> 00:51:55,559
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds good.

644
00:51:55,619 --> 00:51:56,019
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

645
00:51:56,419 --> 00:52:03,380
[SPEAKER_04]: And I wanted to also thank you and Sam and Ryan and Laurie and, and the whole LMH team that's been with us from the beginning.

646
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:07,541
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for all your hard work and look forward to working with you in the future.

647
00:52:08,261 --> 00:52:14,222
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems like this project is moving full steam ahead, so it's going to be great to see it when it's done.

648
00:52:14,322 --> 00:52:17,323
[SPEAKER_04]: So we wish you all the luck and thank you for all,

649
00:52:17,983 --> 00:52:19,965
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you helping answering all the questions that we have?

650
00:52:19,985 --> 00:52:22,166
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there any other further questions?

651
00:52:22,206 --> 00:52:23,487
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Councilor Scarpelli.

652
00:52:23,867 --> 00:52:25,728
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President, I'm sorry.

653
00:52:26,029 --> 00:52:35,875
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, I just wanted to reiterate my thanks to our team at LMH and thank them for always being on the other end of the phone.

654
00:52:35,895 --> 00:52:42,219
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, I'd be remiss to say the backbone of communications, Sam Tarabelski.

655
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:44,041
[SPEAKER_09]: It's nice to see Sam back and

656
00:52:48,003 --> 00:52:58,486
[SPEAKER_09]: And just reiterate, we have bumpy roads and to have the commitment of a partnership with Lawrence Memorial and Hallmark Health.

657
00:52:59,087 --> 00:53:10,010
[SPEAKER_09]: And hopefully as we move forward to bigger projects, especially in our backyard up in the heights in the future, that this partnership stays strong and moves forward in a positive light.

658
00:53:10,410 --> 00:53:16,412
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you everyone for all your hard work and we still have some more to go, so I look forward to our future.

659
00:53:16,652 --> 00:53:16,912
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

660
00:53:17,392 --> 00:53:18,533
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

661
00:53:18,834 --> 00:53:19,975
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other questions from the council?

662
00:53:20,055 --> 00:53:20,635
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President?

663
00:53:20,696 --> 00:53:21,516
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Councilor Marks.

664
00:53:22,257 --> 00:53:26,161
[SPEAKER_02]: I just would like to put my three recommendations in the form of a motion.

665
00:53:27,342 --> 00:53:32,988
[SPEAKER_02]: The first one would be that two additional renderings of the electrical box

666
00:53:33,749 --> 00:53:58,066
[SPEAKER_02]: and other alternatives aesthetically pleasing would be provided to the CAG group and to the city council, as well as neighbors and direct abutters, and that a fence be installed between the properties, between the parking lot and 216 Governor's Ave, a full fence, and that as soon as

667
00:53:59,847 --> 00:54:17,058
[SPEAKER_02]: the discussions had with the police department and the traffic commission regarding public safety, pedestrian safety, and speeding, as well as signage, that those discussions be presented to the council.

668
00:54:17,679 --> 00:54:20,220
[SPEAKER_02]: So those three in the form of a motion, Mr. President.

669
00:54:20,521 --> 00:54:22,022
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

670
00:54:22,462 --> 00:54:24,864
[SPEAKER_04]: Clerk Hurtubise, do you have the wording on those motions?

671
00:54:27,485 --> 00:54:28,326
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm working on the last one.

672
00:54:47,783 --> 00:54:50,484
[SPEAKER_22]: The first one is the 2 additional veterans.

673
00:54:52,826 --> 00:54:53,826
[SPEAKER_22]: Of the electrical box.

674
00:54:54,286 --> 00:54:56,968
[SPEAKER_22]: He provided the community by the Council and the neighbors.

675
00:54:58,869 --> 00:55:05,353
[SPEAKER_22]: Second recommendation is that the is that offense be installed between the parking lot to 16 governor's Avenue.

676
00:55:06,393 --> 00:55:07,354
[SPEAKER_22]: And the 3rd is that when the

677
00:55:14,036 --> 00:55:14,376
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect.

678
00:55:14,576 --> 00:55:14,976
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

679
00:55:14,996 --> 00:55:15,437
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

680
00:55:15,457 --> 00:55:17,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you on that motion of offer by console.

681
00:55:17,918 --> 00:55:19,178
[SPEAKER_04]: Mark seconded by a console.

682
00:55:19,198 --> 00:55:21,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Ask our Pelley clerk heard of these, please call the roll.

683
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:25,021
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

684
00:55:25,041 --> 00:55:25,161
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

685
00:55:25,181 --> 00:55:25,441
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

686
00:55:25,461 --> 00:55:25,521
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

687
00:55:25,761 --> 00:55:26,001
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

688
00:55:36,769 --> 00:55:37,550
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Scarpelli.

689
00:55:37,590 --> 00:55:37,990
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

690
00:55:38,470 --> 00:55:39,171
[SPEAKER_22]: President Stacco.

691
00:55:39,371 --> 00:55:42,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, and the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

692
00:55:42,714 --> 00:55:45,416
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other questions from the council?

693
00:55:46,937 --> 00:55:48,338
[SPEAKER_04]: No, okay.

694
00:55:48,398 --> 00:55:50,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Clerk Hurtubise, does anyone have their hand up?

695
00:55:52,001 --> 00:55:54,223
[SPEAKER_22]: Not that I can see, but I'm scrolling through.

696
00:55:54,243 --> 00:55:55,804
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I think Marsha.

697
00:56:03,390 --> 00:56:04,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Marsha, I'm trying to unmute you.

698
00:56:07,577 --> 00:56:09,417
[SPEAKER_04]: Marsha, name and address for the record, please.

699
00:56:10,458 --> 00:56:11,298
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, thank you.

700
00:56:11,958 --> 00:56:13,698
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Marsha Kirsten.

701
00:56:14,339 --> 00:56:17,579
[SPEAKER_03]: My address is 11 Upton Terrace in Medford.

702
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:36,944
[SPEAKER_03]: I sat in today mainly to thank all the people from the hospital for all the hard work they've done and for the many times that they have listened to me.

703
00:56:37,992 --> 00:57:00,145
[SPEAKER_03]: I still have a dream for Medford and for you that you can eventually, when some of these crises are passed, to go beyond the ADA in accessibility and continue to build medical services for seniors who are 20% of the population.

704
00:57:01,185 --> 00:57:05,608
[SPEAKER_03]: The people I have met from the hospital have been wonderful.

705
00:57:06,929 --> 00:57:09,970
[SPEAKER_03]: And I appreciate all that, too.

706
00:57:10,831 --> 00:57:13,231
[SPEAKER_03]: They have cared deeply about the community.

707
00:57:13,311 --> 00:57:17,833
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know that all of you do that as well.

708
00:57:18,533 --> 00:57:28,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, I would like to thank the city councilors who have been patient with me and listened also during a long period of time.

709
00:57:29,298 --> 00:57:32,479
[SPEAKER_03]: And I still have that vision.

710
00:57:33,799 --> 00:57:35,260
[SPEAKER_03]: And I hope that some of you can

711
00:57:35,919 --> 00:57:42,262
[SPEAKER_03]: When we can work more toward the future, we'll think about it and try to implement it.

712
00:57:42,842 --> 00:57:45,443
[SPEAKER_03]: It's my dream for a society I would like.

713
00:57:46,163 --> 00:57:47,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much.

714
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:48,184
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Marsha.

715
00:57:48,204 --> 00:57:51,085
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

716
00:57:51,605 --> 00:57:53,166
[SPEAKER_04]: Clerk Hurtubise, is there any more hands?

717
00:57:53,246 --> 00:57:57,728
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Beverly O'Reilly, name and address for the record, please.

718
00:57:59,989 --> 00:58:02,090
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, 16 Joyce Road, Medford.

719
00:58:05,431 --> 00:58:05,691
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

720
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:26,979
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to follow up on a point that Lori made about the DOM funds and how some of that will go back to the community and be on record as having asked the hospital if those funds can be shared with our community in Medford since we are the ones that are

721
00:58:31,374 --> 00:58:38,016
[SPEAKER_07]: going to have visitors from other communities coming into our city to access the ASC.

722
00:58:38,056 --> 00:58:44,779
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would like to see the funds that are shared with community organizations to be shared with Medford programs, please.

723
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:49,201
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

724
00:58:49,581 --> 00:58:50,021
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

725
00:58:53,562 --> 00:58:55,303
[SPEAKER_04]: Laurie Anich, if you wanted to comment on that.

726
00:58:58,084 --> 00:58:58,624
[SPEAKER_04]: Laurie?

727
00:58:58,844 --> 00:58:59,725
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, thank you.

728
00:59:01,927 --> 00:59:02,928
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for that.

729
00:59:03,428 --> 00:59:11,737
[SPEAKER_12]: So the process is quite prescriptive from the state, from DPH.

730
00:59:11,937 --> 00:59:13,719
[SPEAKER_12]: There is an RFP process.

731
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:20,526
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyone, clearly from Medford and surrounding communities who meet the requirements can apply.

732
00:59:24,432 --> 00:59:37,761
[SPEAKER_12]: funds that, as the DPH has described, that really support root cause of health care disparities, or the kind of programs and resources and services that they're looking for.

733
00:59:38,401 --> 00:59:50,128
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think there's a lot of good opportunity in Medford specifically, and knowing that we've got a very robust and diverse allocation committee who

734
00:59:51,437 --> 00:59:59,323
[SPEAKER_12]: And as I mentioned, some key members who really understand the community, understand Medford, will be in support of that.

735
00:59:59,543 --> 01:00:07,309
[SPEAKER_12]: So I encourage people to go to the website, as I mentioned, and to read up on it.

736
01:00:07,369 --> 01:00:12,413
[SPEAKER_12]: And if you think you have some good ideas, please, please, please do apply.

737
01:00:12,433 --> 01:00:15,355
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

738
01:00:17,355 --> 01:00:22,318
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Clark, you see anyone, anyone, any hands from anyone that has not spoken so far?

739
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:24,880
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

740
01:00:26,881 --> 01:00:28,322
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't see any additional hands, Mr. President.

741
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:29,183
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, thank you.

742
01:00:29,203 --> 01:00:33,706
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have any LNH?

743
01:00:34,287 --> 01:00:37,489
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, let's just dispose of this first before we move forward.

744
01:00:37,529 --> 01:00:40,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, is there a, the chair awaits a motion with regard to 20570.

745
01:00:40,671 --> 01:00:41,512
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion to receive in place.

746
01:00:44,738 --> 01:00:50,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, on the motion of Councilor Knight to reconvene in six months, seconded by?

747
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:50,603
[SPEAKER_04]: Second.

748
01:00:50,623 --> 01:00:54,347
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, as amended by Councilor Marks.

749
01:00:54,387 --> 01:00:55,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Apologies to Councilor Marks.

750
01:00:55,988 --> 01:00:56,209
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

751
01:00:57,189 --> 01:00:59,031
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, second.

752
01:00:59,051 --> 01:01:00,853
[SPEAKER_22]: So Councilor Knight's moving to reconvene in six months?

753
01:01:01,273 --> 01:01:01,613
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct.

754
01:01:03,195 --> 01:01:05,197
[SPEAKER_04]: Or sooner if need be, Mr. President.

755
01:01:05,217 --> 01:01:06,098
[SPEAKER_04]: Or sooner if need be.

756
01:01:12,278 --> 01:01:14,239
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was seconded by Councilor Bears.

757
01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:14,819
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

758
01:01:19,582 --> 01:01:21,163
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. President, I do have one question.

759
01:01:21,523 --> 01:01:21,703
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

760
01:01:22,624 --> 01:01:28,527
[SPEAKER_22]: Since you already voted on Councilor Marks' motion, is that a B paper or is that going to be an amendment to the main paper?

761
01:01:28,587 --> 01:01:30,128
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, you already voted on it.

762
01:01:30,148 --> 01:01:31,109
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll make that a B paper.

763
01:01:31,129 --> 01:01:31,689
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that all right?

764
01:01:32,049 --> 01:01:32,469
[SPEAKER_04]: B paper.

765
01:01:34,891 --> 01:01:34,991
[SPEAKER_22]: OK.

766
01:01:36,828 --> 01:01:46,872
[SPEAKER_22]: So council night's motion is to reconvene in six months or sooner if necessary Correct You are correct on that motion Yes Yes

767
01:02:03,732 --> 01:02:04,452
[SPEAKER_22]: President Fevella call.

[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Senate affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

769
01:02:08,374 --> 01:02:11,054
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you everyone at LMH, we thank you for being here tonight.

770
01:02:12,015 --> 01:02:12,655
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Morell.

771
01:02:13,435 --> 01:02:14,436
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you council, appreciate it.

772
01:02:14,816 --> 01:02:15,216
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

773
01:02:16,536 --> 01:02:29,541
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, while we're on the suspension, we will take- Mr. President, you actually reverted to the regular order of business.

774
01:02:31,481 --> 01:02:32,502
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think we did because-

775
01:02:34,416 --> 01:02:43,522
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so on the motion of and the motion got somewhere off to suspend the rules seconded by Vice-president Caraviello, please call the roll Yes No, he said no

776
01:03:03,524 --> 01:03:03,924
[SPEAKER_22]: motion passes.

777
01:03:03,944 --> 01:03:08,427
[SPEAKER_22]: The rules are suspended.

778
01:03:08,668 --> 01:03:10,189
[SPEAKER_22]: That was

779
01:03:31,768 --> 01:03:43,474
[SPEAKER_04]: 20-587, October 1st, 2020, to the Honorable President and members of the Medford City Council, City Hall, Medford, Massachusetts, 02155, regarding COVID-19 monthly update.

01:03:59,983 --> 01:04:03,548
[SPEAKER_04]: to provide an update on the city's response to COVID-19.

782
01:04:04,108 --> 01:04:07,853
[SPEAKER_04]: The latest community data and other relevant data and information as available.

783
01:04:08,394 --> 01:04:12,058
[SPEAKER_04]: The updates Mary Ann or designee will provide include but are not limited to.

784
01:04:13,243 --> 01:04:14,624
[SPEAKER_04]: Latest positivity rate.

785
01:04:14,724 --> 01:04:30,739
[SPEAKER_04]: Currently we are posting case numbers daily to www.medfordma.org slash coronavirus dash information, as well as state data on a weekly basis and full breakdowns of positivity and death rates by race and ethnicity on a monthly basis.

786
01:04:31,319 --> 01:04:39,247
[SPEAKER_04]: We can answer additional questions regarding this data, our stage designated color code and what the data means for our reopening plans in Medford.

787
01:04:40,916 --> 01:04:42,037
[SPEAKER_04]: Tufts University updates.

788
01:04:42,077 --> 01:04:51,905
[SPEAKER_04]: We can break down the university's public dashboard with positivity rates, tests completed to date, and answer any questions regarding Tufts-specific COVID-19 plans.

789
01:04:52,606 --> 01:04:54,927
[SPEAKER_04]: Reopening plans and related information.

790
01:04:55,048 --> 01:05:03,414
[SPEAKER_04]: Of particular interest for October, the state has announced that cities and towns may proceed to phase three, step two, as of October 5th.

791
01:05:04,255 --> 01:05:07,076
[SPEAKER_04]: as long as the community is not in the red category.

792
01:05:07,156 --> 01:05:11,196
[SPEAKER_04]: We can provide information about Method Step 2 plans and protocols.

793
01:05:12,797 --> 01:05:32,981
[SPEAKER_04]: Additional updates and information as necessary and available, we will provide updates on programs and resources like the city's RUOK program for seniors, upcoming flu vaccine clinics, and using these to prepare the potential future COVID-19 vaccine clinics, updates on nursing home data and schools and other information.

794
01:05:33,641 --> 01:05:44,883
[SPEAKER_04]: Marianne or another member of my team will be available to the first city council meeting each month to provide these updates as requested, and we will answer any additional questions you may have.

795
01:05:44,943 --> 01:05:46,803
[SPEAKER_04]: Sincerely, Breanna Lungo-Koehn mayor.

796
01:05:48,164 --> 01:05:51,784
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have, let's see, Marianne O'Connor.

797
01:05:51,804 --> 01:05:53,045
[SPEAKER_04]: I just unmuted you.

798
01:05:53,065 --> 01:05:53,865
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Marianne.

799
01:05:54,805 --> 01:05:55,145
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi.

800
01:05:55,245 --> 01:05:56,465
[SPEAKER_13]: Hello, President Falco.

801
01:05:56,485 --> 01:05:58,166
[SPEAKER_13]: Hello, members of the city council.

802
01:05:58,486 --> 01:05:58,966
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a lot.

803
01:06:01,141 --> 01:06:15,831
[SPEAKER_13]: Happy to answer any questions and give you some updates, but I don't know if you want to start with questions, or you just want me to start kind of telling you where we're at right now, and then maybe open up to questions now, whatever.

804
01:06:16,392 --> 01:06:17,012
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't we do that?

805
01:06:17,052 --> 01:06:21,976
[SPEAKER_04]: If you could give us an update, and then from there, I'm sure there'll be questions, and we can ask those questions as they pop up.

806
01:06:22,136 --> 01:06:23,217
[SPEAKER_27]: You read the update, didn't you?

807
01:06:25,258 --> 01:06:25,799
[SPEAKER_04]: Please continue.

808
01:06:27,068 --> 01:06:27,609
[SPEAKER_13]: OK, sure.

809
01:06:28,149 --> 01:06:30,992
[SPEAKER_13]: So I guess we'll go back.

810
01:06:31,012 --> 01:06:35,936
[SPEAKER_13]: So as you know of yesterday, right, so we entered into phase 3, step 2.

811
01:06:36,877 --> 01:06:43,403
[SPEAKER_13]: But obviously, just as a reminder to everyone, phase 3 is still titled Vigilant, right?

812
01:06:44,522 --> 01:06:47,803
[SPEAKER_13]: The fact that we are starting to open things up a little bit more.

813
01:06:48,303 --> 01:06:52,744
[SPEAKER_13]: The fact that the weather's getting a little colder outside and people are moving indoors.

814
01:06:52,824 --> 01:07:04,107
[SPEAKER_13]: It's really important to remind people that we are still in a vigilant phase, which means social distancing and mask wearing is critical and so important to stopping the spread.

815
01:07:04,807 --> 01:07:11,509
[SPEAKER_13]: But I'll just kind of highlight some major changes as to what this next step two means in phase three.

816
01:07:12,416 --> 01:07:14,218
[SPEAKER_13]: especially for us here in Medford.

817
01:07:15,699 --> 01:07:23,644
[SPEAKER_13]: Some of the major significant, I should say, changes are outdoor events that expands to 100.

818
01:07:25,005 --> 01:07:31,510
[SPEAKER_13]: However, still private events, your own backyard, private wedding or whatever, that is still limited to 50.

819
01:07:31,690 --> 01:07:36,093
[SPEAKER_13]: Indoor still remains at 25.

820
01:07:37,314 --> 01:07:38,575
[SPEAKER_13]: So that has not changed.

821
01:07:38,975 --> 01:07:41,137
[SPEAKER_13]: While the outdoor has, the indoor has not.

822
01:07:42,255 --> 01:07:50,438
[SPEAKER_13]: Performance venues are now open, although no singing is still involved in our wind instruments.

823
01:07:52,658 --> 01:07:55,039
[SPEAKER_13]: Indoor, 50% occupancy, up to 250.

824
01:07:55,119 --> 01:08:00,181
[SPEAKER_13]: Same with outdoor, 50% occupancy, limited to up to 250.

825
01:08:00,841 --> 01:08:08,083
[SPEAKER_13]: But indoor and outdoor performances, which were typically not, especially indoor, were not allowed in lawn space, are now allowed.

826
01:08:09,305 --> 01:08:12,266
[SPEAKER_13]: seven or more interesting changes.

827
01:08:12,986 --> 01:08:13,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Extra seating.

828
01:08:14,066 --> 01:08:14,986
[SPEAKER_04]: Marion, one minute, please.

829
01:08:15,026 --> 01:08:17,507
[SPEAKER_04]: Point of information council night.

830
01:08:17,627 --> 01:08:24,628
[SPEAKER_27]: Do these phase three, part two updates that you just gave us relative to capacity extend to the Medford City Council Chambers?

831
01:08:26,649 --> 01:08:30,569
[SPEAKER_13]: So no, so this does not apply to municipal bodies.

832
01:08:30,589 --> 01:08:38,131
[SPEAKER_13]: So municipal bodies are exempt from these, but you still have to comply with the six foot social distancing rule.

833
01:08:38,379 --> 01:08:42,040
[SPEAKER_27]: So there's no limit on the capacity of people, it's just we're exempt from that, you said?

834
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:45,261
[SPEAKER_13]: As long as you can do six foot social distancing.

835
01:08:45,301 --> 01:08:51,223
[SPEAKER_13]: So whatever the capacity would be with the six foot social distancing is what you're allowed.

836
01:08:51,243 --> 01:08:56,145
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, so we could have more than 125 people in the council chambers provided that we could maintain safe space?

837
01:08:58,085 --> 01:08:59,446
[SPEAKER_13]: If you could do that in there, sure.

838
01:08:59,586 --> 01:09:00,066
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

839
01:09:04,107 --> 01:09:04,687
[SPEAKER_04]: Please continue.

840
01:09:04,848 --> 01:09:05,148
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

841
01:09:05,368 --> 01:09:06,048
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

842
01:09:08,840 --> 01:09:24,410
[SPEAKER_13]: So the only other kind of more pertinent changes would be that retail now, that's retail specifically, so that would be your 7-Elevens, even your grocery stores are considered retail.

843
01:09:24,450 --> 01:09:27,732
[SPEAKER_13]: They can now do self-serve beverage only.

844
01:09:30,294 --> 01:09:38,159
[SPEAKER_13]: And in restaurants, seating has been expanded from six to 10, which you may or may not already know.

845
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:41,281
[SPEAKER_13]: And seating at the bar is now allowed.

846
01:09:41,401 --> 01:09:44,923
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, that's not like bar seating.

847
01:09:44,963 --> 01:09:47,624
[SPEAKER_13]: That's not for bar service.

848
01:09:47,704 --> 01:09:51,926
[SPEAKER_13]: It's for seated dining service, but you can sit at the bar.

849
01:09:52,286 --> 01:09:58,328
[SPEAKER_13]: The bar, there's a six-feet distance between you and the bartender or the employees.

850
01:10:00,933 --> 01:10:02,794
[SPEAKER_13]: That's kind of the highlights from the new.

851
01:10:02,874 --> 01:10:08,337
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a couple of the sports differences, changes in spectator numbers and stuff.

852
01:10:08,497 --> 01:10:13,981
[SPEAKER_13]: But that's kind of the high-level look at the phase three, step two changes.

853
01:10:14,001 --> 01:10:18,283
[SPEAKER_13]: Gyms and libraries are now allowed 50% occupancy.

854
01:10:19,004 --> 01:10:20,865
[SPEAKER_13]: That's another one that would affect us here.

855
01:10:24,002 --> 01:10:26,683
[SPEAKER_13]: As far as the latest data is concerned.

856
01:10:26,803 --> 01:10:32,146
[SPEAKER_13]: So we are really looking at the state's data that comes out on Wednesday evenings.

857
01:10:33,146 --> 01:10:42,310
[SPEAKER_13]: However, you have to know that that Wednesday evening data is based on data that ends the previous Saturday and goes to expire.

858
01:10:44,071 --> 01:10:48,753
[SPEAKER_13]: So as of our last week's data, we are still in the yellow zone.

859
01:10:48,773 --> 01:10:51,054
[SPEAKER_13]: So there's the gray, green, yellow, red.

860
01:10:52,337 --> 01:10:53,498
[SPEAKER_13]: We are still yellow.

861
01:10:53,558 --> 01:10:56,300
[SPEAKER_13]: We've been yellow since, I believe, September 3rd.

862
01:10:57,080 --> 01:10:59,442
[SPEAKER_13]: So the entire month of September we were yellow.

863
01:10:59,482 --> 01:11:00,882
[SPEAKER_04]: So point of information, Mr. President?

864
01:11:01,343 --> 01:11:04,425
[SPEAKER_04]: Mary Ann, if I may, point of information, Councilor Scarapelli.

865
01:11:04,985 --> 01:11:05,966
[SPEAKER_09]: Could you just clarify that?

866
01:11:06,006 --> 01:11:11,549
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought last time we talked, Mary Ann, you corrected me and said we were in the green, I believe.

867
01:11:12,586 --> 01:11:14,126
[SPEAKER_13]: I think you said we're in the green.

868
01:11:14,326 --> 01:11:15,206
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry, Councilor.

869
01:11:15,266 --> 01:11:18,627
[SPEAKER_13]: I think you said we're in the green, and I said, no, we've been in the yellow.

870
01:11:19,127 --> 01:11:19,407
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

871
01:11:19,927 --> 01:11:24,208
[SPEAKER_13]: So we've been in the yellow since about September 3rd, the entire month of September.

872
01:11:24,588 --> 01:11:25,488
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, thank you.

873
01:11:26,148 --> 01:11:27,809
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, no problem.

874
01:11:27,989 --> 01:11:41,811
[SPEAKER_13]: Which means we have an average over that 14-day period that the state uses that data point in, we have between four and eight cases, less than eight, greater than four cases.

875
01:11:44,141 --> 01:11:47,724
[SPEAKER_13]: And it looks like, you know, coming forward, some of the new data will come out tomorrow night.

876
01:11:48,444 --> 01:11:52,627
[SPEAKER_13]: And that will be based on, you know, the Sunday 9-20 to the Saturday 10-3.

877
01:11:52,667 --> 01:11:54,768
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a two-week data week.

878
01:11:54,928 --> 01:11:56,550
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, it comes out on Wednesday.

879
01:11:56,750 --> 01:11:58,811
[SPEAKER_13]: It ends on the previous Saturday.

880
01:11:59,712 --> 01:12:09,819
[SPEAKER_13]: And for my calculations, if my math skills are any good, but the way that the state categorizes it or does their math, kind of,

881
01:12:12,076 --> 01:12:15,658
[SPEAKER_13]: complicated, and the fact that cases change every day.

882
01:12:15,758 --> 01:12:29,505
[SPEAKER_13]: So even though they're going to pull this data tomorrow morning and end on last Saturday, the data is changing every day as to whether a case may have been not ours, should have been somewhere else.

883
01:12:30,305 --> 01:12:35,147
[SPEAKER_13]: The data is very difficult because it's never at the same time that everyone's pulling the same data.

884
01:12:35,187 --> 01:12:39,309
[SPEAKER_13]: But anyways, that being said, I'm thinking there are probably about 52 cases.

885
01:12:41,487 --> 01:12:49,894
[SPEAKER_13]: As of last Saturday, for those past two weeks, which I believe still puts us in the yellow, again, if my math matches the state's math.

886
01:12:50,374 --> 01:12:52,756
[SPEAKER_13]: However, we're going to be higher than we have been.

887
01:12:52,876 --> 01:12:55,819
[SPEAKER_13]: So last week we were at an average of 4.82.

888
01:12:57,580 --> 01:13:04,866
[SPEAKER_13]: I think the 52 cases are probably going to pull us up closer to a 6, which is higher than we've been in a while.

889
01:13:06,741 --> 01:13:20,908
[SPEAKER_13]: So again, given the increase in cases, not only here, but statewide, it's really important that we be diligent in what we're doing, and mask wearing, and social distancing, and gathering limits, and really paying attention.

890
01:13:23,149 --> 01:13:30,953
[SPEAKER_13]: The percent positivity as far as the state's rate last week was, and if I'm getting to it, if it's more than 20, please let me know.

891
01:13:32,264 --> 01:13:40,569
[SPEAKER_13]: But the percent positivity, so that's the amount of positive cases over the amount of tests done, right?

892
01:13:40,849 --> 01:13:43,871
[SPEAKER_13]: The amount of positive tests over the amount of tests done.

893
01:13:43,931 --> 01:13:47,012
[SPEAKER_13]: State has those last week as .36.

894
01:13:48,593 --> 01:13:52,936
[SPEAKER_13]: That's not totally real here because of all the testing that Tufts is doing.

895
01:13:53,756 --> 01:13:56,058
Tufts is doing 12,000 plus tests a week.

896
01:13:56,298 --> 01:13:57,058
So that kind of,

897
01:14:01,237 --> 01:14:06,700
[SPEAKER_13]: puts our positivity rate looks really good because they're doing so much testing.

898
01:14:07,160 --> 01:14:09,321
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's not what we really want to look like.

899
01:14:09,401 --> 01:14:12,423
[SPEAKER_13]: And I am working with the state, I've used to pull it out.

900
01:14:12,443 --> 01:14:17,646
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we're looking more to probably a 2.4 right now.

901
01:14:19,427 --> 01:14:21,108
[SPEAKER_13]: And you know, we don't want to be above that.

902
01:14:21,788 --> 01:14:25,490
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're looking at that too.

903
01:14:25,850 --> 01:14:28,492
[SPEAKER_13]: And all of this is being looked at with the school department as well.

904
01:14:29,152 --> 01:14:30,733
[SPEAKER_13]: And certainly the red, yellow, green,

905
01:14:31,238 --> 01:14:36,161
[SPEAKER_13]: and mapping has been looked at at the schools as far as how they're moving and moving forward.

906
01:14:38,142 --> 01:14:47,607
[SPEAKER_13]: But I must say that what Tufts is doing with their own students, with their own community, it really seems to be working quite well.

907
01:14:47,627 --> 01:14:49,608
[SPEAKER_13]: Their productivity rate's extremely low.

908
01:14:49,668 --> 01:14:55,791
[SPEAKER_13]: They've only had about 25 cases since they started this testing, which was back in early August.

909
01:14:57,292 --> 01:15:00,494
[SPEAKER_13]: Less than half of it, about, so of 25, I think we've had

910
01:15:01,102 --> 01:15:06,025
[SPEAKER_13]: I wouldn't say 11, 11 and 12 have been housed, and maybe 13 have been made consumables.

911
01:15:06,045 --> 01:15:17,430
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're pretty evenly spread, but still, I believe the tough system, what they're doing, they're isolating students immediately, they're contact tracing and quarantining students immediately.

912
01:15:17,450 --> 01:15:21,272
[SPEAKER_13]: I think they're really doing, I have to say, a great job.

913
01:15:22,873 --> 01:15:28,476
[SPEAKER_13]: As you've seen in other colleges, they've had some horrible, nightmarish outbreaks, and we,

914
01:15:30,664 --> 01:15:32,445
[SPEAKER_13]: would have not seen it.

915
01:15:32,465 --> 01:15:34,807
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think that's impacting Tufts efforts.

916
01:15:36,328 --> 01:15:42,731
[SPEAKER_13]: Tufts did announce today that they will be offering community testing to neighbors.

917
01:15:42,791 --> 01:15:45,533
[SPEAKER_13]: So those are streets abutting the Tufts campus.

918
01:15:46,073 --> 01:15:50,016
[SPEAKER_13]: There's quite a few lists, quite a few streets listed.

919
01:15:50,476 --> 01:15:54,479
[SPEAKER_13]: You can find that on their website, their community relations website.

920
01:15:55,939 --> 01:15:59,982
[SPEAKER_13]: It's free to those folks who live on those streets.

921
01:16:00,996 --> 01:16:03,277
[SPEAKER_13]: And again, that's out of a bunch of caution.

922
01:16:03,377 --> 01:16:10,559
[SPEAKER_13]: I hope that maybe the neighbors know that neighbors are concerned, as well as should be.

923
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:13,801
[SPEAKER_13]: And they will be gearing up to about 300 tests a week.

924
01:16:13,841 --> 01:16:17,802
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't believe they're going to be at that quite yet, like next week when they stop.

925
01:16:17,842 --> 01:16:19,223
[SPEAKER_13]: But they will, if necessary.

926
01:16:19,243 --> 01:16:22,404
[SPEAKER_13]: It's kind of going to see how much interest there is out there.

927
01:16:22,424 --> 01:16:26,065
[SPEAKER_13]: But they will be offering free testing to those streets, to those neighbors.

928
01:16:26,633 --> 01:16:35,539
[SPEAKER_13]: who live abiding the Tufts campus and abiding the streets that house a lot of off-campus students.

929
01:16:35,899 --> 01:16:37,920
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's great.

930
01:16:38,481 --> 01:16:42,623
[SPEAKER_13]: We will be offering a family flu clinic.

931
01:16:42,743 --> 01:16:52,830
[SPEAKER_13]: It's very important this year, I can see you from here and everywhere else, that we have, you know, combined with COVID, that flu is coming up and we certainly don't want to have

932
01:16:53,740 --> 01:16:54,980
[SPEAKER_13]: a combined situation.

933
01:16:55,000 --> 01:17:01,542
[SPEAKER_13]: So we are providing our food clinic to our seniors at our senior center, which was quite successful.

934
01:17:01,602 --> 01:17:05,063
[SPEAKER_13]: And we're doing it COVID-friendly, social distancing.

935
01:17:05,143 --> 01:17:06,243
[SPEAKER_13]: People don't have to worry.

936
01:17:06,303 --> 01:17:10,105
[SPEAKER_13]: We're following the rules.

937
01:17:10,145 --> 01:17:17,587
[SPEAKER_13]: But we will be offering it from 9 to 1 on Saturday, October 24 at the McGlynn for families.

938
01:17:17,667 --> 01:17:19,567
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll be offering to school-aged children.

939
01:17:19,587 --> 01:17:22,428
[SPEAKER_13]: As you know, we order from the governor for school-aged children.

940
01:17:23,652 --> 01:17:27,123
[SPEAKER_13]: should be receiving their flu vaccine by 1231.

941
01:17:30,357 --> 01:17:32,159
[SPEAKER_13]: And so we're trying to help with that.

942
01:17:32,179 --> 01:17:36,442
[SPEAKER_13]: We did order additional flu vaccines, and we are opening that up.

943
01:17:36,582 --> 01:17:38,283
[SPEAKER_13]: The first one is Saturday, October 24th.

944
01:17:38,303 --> 01:17:46,930
[SPEAKER_13]: We're hoping to do additional ones and drive-through potentials so that we can prepare and drill for what it's going to look like when we have the COVID vaccine.

945
01:17:47,911 --> 01:17:50,914
[SPEAKER_13]: But right now, we want to get the flu vaccine out as much as we can.

946
01:17:50,994 --> 01:17:54,537
[SPEAKER_13]: So please put that on the calendar, October 24th, or 9-1-1.

947
01:18:03,107 --> 01:18:07,009
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not sure if there are any other updates or information.

948
01:18:07,989 --> 01:18:19,774
[SPEAKER_13]: The other thing that we are obviously doing with TAF's assistance is we are offering teacher testing, which has been great, really helpful.

949
01:18:21,435 --> 01:18:26,617
[SPEAKER_13]: Prior to teachers who were doing the hybrid back to school model,

950
01:18:27,722 --> 01:18:35,687
[SPEAKER_13]: prior to those grades starting class on Monday, we are testing the teachers who will be entering the buildings for the first time previous Wednesday.

951
01:18:36,167 --> 01:18:40,750
[SPEAKER_13]: So tomorrow will be our first of three.

952
01:18:40,790 --> 01:18:49,396
[SPEAKER_13]: Tomorrow will be our third testing that we've done for teachers who will be entering the building for the first time next week.

953
01:18:49,916 --> 01:18:56,020
[SPEAKER_13]: We were able to catch a couple of positive teachers in our first round prior to them entering the building.

954
01:18:56,704 --> 01:19:00,187
[SPEAKER_13]: So that was really great that they did not enter the building as positive cases.

955
01:19:00,867 --> 01:19:10,534
[SPEAKER_13]: And last week we did not have any positives, but we will be doing testing again tomorrow for the teachers and staff who will be entering the building next Monday.

956
01:19:12,115 --> 01:19:21,122
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's, and that again has been in collaboration with Tufts and Armstrong Unions has been also helping greatly with those efforts as well.

957
01:19:24,378 --> 01:19:32,102
[SPEAKER_13]: stay with approximately 200 per week that we got staffed up to do those testings every Wednesday.

958
01:19:32,442 --> 01:19:38,185
[SPEAKER_13]: So, I think that's all that I have here.

959
01:19:38,265 --> 01:19:40,526
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not sure if there's any additional questions.

960
01:19:41,227 --> 01:19:41,987
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

961
01:19:42,027 --> 01:19:43,328
[SPEAKER_04]: Mary Ann, thank you very much for the update.

962
01:19:43,348 --> 01:19:45,469
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a number of councilors that have questions.

963
01:19:45,489 --> 01:19:50,692
[SPEAKER_04]: We have Councilor Bears, Councilor Morell, Councilor Scarpelli, Vice President Caraviello, Councilor Bears.

964
01:19:51,670 --> 01:19:55,812
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Mr. President, and thank you, Mary Ann.

965
01:19:55,832 --> 01:20:01,814
[SPEAKER_25]: I think you've had an incredibly difficult job over these past several months, keeping people alive, keeping people safe and healthy.

966
01:20:02,715 --> 01:20:12,018
[SPEAKER_25]: And now, as it drags on, as the serious situation drags on, you have the job of trying to keep people in our community, keeping them safe from themselves, to an extent.

967
01:20:13,579 --> 01:20:15,440
[SPEAKER_25]: We all want things to go back to normal.

968
01:20:15,981 --> 01:20:20,364
[SPEAKER_25]: We all want things to be the way they were before, but we are where we are.

969
01:20:20,384 --> 01:20:23,566
[SPEAKER_25]: So I just have a couple questions.

970
01:20:24,687 --> 01:20:29,510
[SPEAKER_25]: You mentioned that we've been in the yellow for over a month, that our positivity

971
01:20:30,165 --> 01:20:33,708
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, we have positive tests at some point in the Medford Public Schools.

972
01:20:35,729 --> 01:20:44,136
[SPEAKER_25]: And, you know, we've seen over the past two weeks in Massachusetts, a 65% increase in COVID cases, positive cases over the past two weeks in Massachusetts.

973
01:20:44,637 --> 01:20:48,380
[SPEAKER_25]: And the governor today was talking about a winter surge.

974
01:20:49,020 --> 01:20:51,622
[SPEAKER_25]: So it's not the time to let our guard down at all.

975
01:20:51,642 --> 01:20:52,563
[SPEAKER_25]: We have to be vigilant.

976
01:20:52,583 --> 01:20:53,664
[SPEAKER_25]: We need to be careful.

977
01:20:53,884 --> 01:20:54,444
[SPEAKER_25]: We shouldn't be

978
01:20:55,325 --> 01:20:58,907
[SPEAKER_25]: pushing things faster than they should go, as recommended by our public health experts.

979
01:20:59,247 --> 01:21:12,315
[SPEAKER_25]: I was just wondering, Marianne, given those statistics and given what the governor was talking about today, what are the plans or what are the thoughts around if cases continue to go up over the next couple months?

980
01:21:14,476 --> 01:21:16,057
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, thank you for that.

981
01:21:16,818 --> 01:21:17,218
[SPEAKER_13]: You're right.

982
01:21:18,318 --> 01:21:22,521
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think everyone is experiencing some COVID fatigue, right?

983
01:21:22,721 --> 01:21:24,382
[SPEAKER_13]: It's been going on a long time.

984
01:21:25,299 --> 01:21:28,480
This is not our time to put our guard down.

985
01:21:28,940 --> 01:21:35,581
[SPEAKER_13]: This is time to be more vigilant than ever, because yes, everyone is predicting a second surge.

986
01:21:35,601 --> 01:21:41,102
[SPEAKER_13]: And yes, we have seen increases in the state metrics, in our local metrics.

987
01:21:41,802 --> 01:21:44,623
[SPEAKER_13]: So we are concerned, absolutely.

988
01:21:44,643 --> 01:21:49,404
[SPEAKER_13]: And again, I think people need to be more vigilant than ever.

989
01:21:51,237 --> 01:21:56,239
[SPEAKER_13]: stay socially distanced, don't go to large gatherings, don't have large family gatherings.

990
01:21:57,819 --> 01:22:07,263
[SPEAKER_13]: And our plans are to continue to watch the data, watch the metrics, and certainly I've already had discussions with the mayor about, you know, things continue.

991
01:22:07,303 --> 01:22:19,468
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, you know, the state is walking into, you know, phase three, step two, but if things go the wrong way here in Medford,

992
01:22:21,263 --> 01:22:24,284
We don't, we can always go stronger than the state.

993
01:22:24,624 --> 01:22:28,325
[SPEAKER_13]: We can't go weaker than the state, but we can always go stronger than the state.

994
01:22:28,825 --> 01:22:41,590
[SPEAKER_13]: So we could pull back on those gathering rules on, you know, pull back the 100 back to a 50, you know, stop some of the, I know this is disagreeing, and I do feel for that.

995
01:22:41,670 --> 01:22:43,590
[SPEAKER_13]: I understand that, and I feel for that.

996
01:22:45,111 --> 01:22:48,152
[SPEAKER_13]: But there, you know, we may have to take some serious

997
01:22:49,127 --> 01:22:56,190
[SPEAKER_13]: decisions going forward if things continue, specifically community-specific here in Medford.

998
01:22:56,670 --> 01:23:05,073
[SPEAKER_13]: The state may walk it back themselves if things continue to go the way they're going.

999
01:23:06,934 --> 01:23:07,374
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

1000
01:23:07,534 --> 01:23:15,717
[SPEAKER_13]: But so part of the message, I guess I didn't explain to you, is so we're entering into phase three, step two, because we've been

1001
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:18,501
[SPEAKER_13]: for the last three weeks.

1002
01:23:18,661 --> 01:23:23,105
[SPEAKER_13]: If we had been red in any of those three weeks, we would not have been able to move forward.

1003
01:23:24,166 --> 01:23:32,652
[SPEAKER_13]: Going forward, if we turn red, like I said, if my math is right tomorrow, we're still yellow, but we may be pushing.

1004
01:23:33,993 --> 01:23:40,038
[SPEAKER_13]: But if we turn red, and then if we're red for three weeks, we step it back.

1005
01:23:40,058 --> 01:23:43,901
[SPEAKER_13]: That means all of those performance guidelines

1006
01:23:46,167 --> 01:23:48,828
[SPEAKER_13]: The restaurants go back to sixth seating.

1007
01:23:48,848 --> 01:23:52,410
[SPEAKER_13]: We go back to step one.

1008
01:23:53,811 --> 01:24:02,376
[SPEAKER_13]: And then we need to be out of the red for three weeks before we can go back to step two.

1009
01:24:03,296 --> 01:24:09,459
So it's really important for businesses, for everybody, that we do the right thing and that we stay vigilant.

1010
01:24:09,579 --> 01:24:12,181
[SPEAKER_13]: Because if we go into the red for three weeks,

1011
01:24:13,197 --> 01:24:13,578
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's.

1012
01:24:26,294 --> 01:24:28,195
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Director.

1013
01:24:28,475 --> 01:24:31,437
[SPEAKER_25]: And I mean, I don't think anyone needs to hear it.

1014
01:24:31,457 --> 01:24:34,219
[SPEAKER_25]: I think we've all heard it ad nauseum over the past five days.

1015
01:24:34,719 --> 01:24:45,265
[SPEAKER_25]: But we have the best example of someone or some group not being vigilant when we have someone who's getting tested every day, catching this coronavirus and super spreading it.

1016
01:24:45,365 --> 01:24:46,846
[SPEAKER_25]: So we just need to be careful.

1017
01:24:47,046 --> 01:24:50,068
[SPEAKER_25]: If the President of the United States is vulnerable, I think we all are.

1018
01:24:51,588 --> 01:24:58,312
[SPEAKER_25]: One other question, you mentioned it a little bit in the positivity rate, Mary Ann, and I was reading about this too.

1019
01:24:58,352 --> 01:25:04,916
[SPEAKER_25]: The state's calculating the positivity rate based on the number of tests, but the old measure was actually on the number of people tested.

1020
01:25:04,976 --> 01:25:17,223
[SPEAKER_25]: Were you saying that the, you know, you said that because there's so many tests at Tufts that our positivity rate was like .36, but if we based it on the number of people being tested, what did you say that number was again?

1021
01:25:18,083 --> 01:25:20,565
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I would still recommend the empties to get it cleared out

1022
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:38,928
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you have two college students, two college roommates, one's being tested four times, the other one's being tested six times.

1023
01:25:39,608 --> 01:25:42,090
[SPEAKER_13]: And on the sixth test, he pops.

1024
01:25:42,110 --> 01:25:46,554
So that's one out of 10 is according to what the state's policy typically may be.

1025
01:25:46,954 --> 01:25:48,315
That would be one out of 10 tests.

1026
01:25:48,355 --> 01:25:50,276
That would be 10% that tested.

1027
01:25:50,637 --> 01:25:52,878
But that doesn't tell us about community spread.

1028
01:25:52,938 --> 01:25:56,521
What we want to know is out of two students, how many tested positive.

1029
01:25:57,145 --> 01:25:59,306
So that would be one out of two, so it's really 50%.

1030
01:26:00,687 --> 01:26:06,690
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's the data kind of gating that we're playing here back and forth.

1031
01:26:06,830 --> 01:26:08,370
[SPEAKER_13]: And Tufts is being really helpful.

1032
01:26:08,390 --> 01:26:14,814
[SPEAKER_13]: They're going to try to help us sort that out, as well as the state epidemiologists.

1033
01:26:15,234 --> 01:26:21,457
[SPEAKER_13]: The state epidemiologists, as much, you know, we've gone back and forth, but they say, you know, these Medford students are in Medford.

1034
01:26:22,296 --> 01:26:26,941
[SPEAKER_13]: They are part of your community, so you cannot not count them from your case counts.

1035
01:26:27,502 --> 01:26:32,907
[SPEAKER_13]: They are low-income students, restaurants, and stores.

1036
01:26:33,248 --> 01:26:35,870
[SPEAKER_13]: So they are part of that community.

1037
01:26:35,890 --> 01:26:39,234
[SPEAKER_13]: As far as the positivity rate goes, there's a little bit of a question.

1038
01:26:39,480 --> 01:26:42,422
[SPEAKER_04]: Excuse me, Mary Ann, point of information, Councilor Scarpelli.

1039
01:26:42,942 --> 01:26:43,262
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1040
01:26:43,563 --> 01:26:48,366
[SPEAKER_09]: Mary, could you just reiterate, I know that I don't want people getting nervous if they read this the wrong way.

1041
01:26:49,006 --> 01:26:56,711
[SPEAKER_09]: You said that the way it's read, that if you talk to two students, one is positive, one is negative.

1042
01:26:56,751 --> 01:26:57,671
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not the case, though.

1043
01:27:01,954 --> 01:27:05,836
[SPEAKER_13]: No, so I was giving an example of if- But that's how, yeah, so that's how it's written.

1044
01:27:07,236 --> 01:27:07,877
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, so there's only 25.

1045
01:27:07,937 --> 01:27:09,478
[SPEAKER_13]: That's how you want to look at it.

1046
01:27:09,538 --> 01:27:12,461
[SPEAKER_13]: What's really giving you the best data for your community.

1047
01:27:12,541 --> 01:27:14,263
[SPEAKER_13]: Is it that one in ten test?

1048
01:27:14,643 --> 01:27:14,863
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

1049
01:27:15,484 --> 01:27:16,425
[SPEAKER_13]: Test positive?

1050
01:27:16,625 --> 01:27:19,247
[SPEAKER_13]: Or is it that one out of two students tested?

1051
01:27:19,287 --> 01:27:21,309
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so one in two students aren't tested positive, right?

1052
01:27:21,389 --> 01:27:22,230
[SPEAKER_09]: That's just to make sure.

1053
01:27:23,131 --> 01:27:23,431
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1054
01:27:23,451 --> 01:27:26,834
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, thanks Marion.

1055
01:27:26,854 --> 01:27:29,336
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, thank you Councilor Bears.

1056
01:27:29,517 --> 01:27:30,618
[SPEAKER_04]: We have Councilor Morell.

1057
01:27:32,247 --> 01:27:33,087
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1058
01:27:33,387 --> 01:27:35,908
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Marianne, for that extensive presentation and update.

1059
01:27:35,928 --> 01:27:36,808
[SPEAKER_28]: I really appreciate it.

1060
01:27:36,828 --> 01:27:42,230
[SPEAKER_28]: I did have some people reaching out as far as you mentioned the two positive cases, I believe, with the schools.

1061
01:27:42,970 --> 01:27:52,293
[SPEAKER_28]: Questions about, as far as maybe numbers for quarantining, because there are the positive cases and then there are the people who may need to quarantine, and obviously that would impact the number of

1062
01:27:52,913 --> 01:27:54,734
[SPEAKER_28]: staff available to support the school.

1063
01:27:54,754 --> 01:28:02,458
[SPEAKER_28]: So I'm curious if the quarantining numbers, if that's something that can be shared or has been shared or any information around that.

1064
01:28:05,159 --> 01:28:16,205
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, so when that first week of testing, they hadn't been back at the building yet when we had those two positive tests.

1065
01:28:16,545 --> 01:28:19,747
[SPEAKER_13]: So there wasn't a lot of quarantining happening there.

1066
01:28:23,413 --> 01:28:24,534
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, in the buildings.

1067
01:28:26,494 --> 01:28:33,918
[SPEAKER_13]: Recently, we've had a positive test within the administration, high school administration staff.

1068
01:28:34,518 --> 01:28:38,820
[SPEAKER_13]: And that has led to additional quarantine.

1069
01:28:38,860 --> 01:28:49,084
[SPEAKER_13]: But for the most part, it's been administration staff and not teacher related, for the most part.

1070
01:28:49,184 --> 01:28:51,305
[SPEAKER_13]: So as far as staff available for students,

1071
01:28:53,789 --> 01:28:55,129
[SPEAKER_13]: So far, we're good.

1072
01:28:55,190 --> 01:28:55,530
[SPEAKER_28]: OK.

1073
01:28:56,130 --> 01:28:56,850
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

1074
01:28:56,910 --> 01:28:58,791
[SPEAKER_28]: And thank you for that information about the flu clinics.

1075
01:28:58,971 --> 01:29:00,371
[SPEAKER_28]: I know you shared the date and time.

1076
01:29:01,352 --> 01:29:06,453
[SPEAKER_28]: Is there somewhere on the website people can find that information, too, and if more flu clinics are offered in the future?

1077
01:29:07,394 --> 01:29:07,714
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure.

1078
01:29:07,774 --> 01:29:09,074
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, we will be posting that.

1079
01:29:09,094 --> 01:29:10,335
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't believe it's posted yet.

1080
01:29:10,835 --> 01:29:16,737
[SPEAKER_13]: But that will be posted on our website and the state website that people can go to along.

1081
01:29:17,657 --> 01:29:19,958
[SPEAKER_13]: And it will be on the school website as well.

1082
01:29:20,618 --> 01:29:20,678
OK.

1083
01:29:21,278 --> 01:29:21,599
[SPEAKER_28]: Wonderful.

1084
01:29:21,619 --> 01:29:21,859
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

1085
01:29:21,879 --> 01:29:22,399
[SPEAKER_28]: That's all I have.

1086
01:29:23,595 --> 01:29:24,556
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Morell.

1087
01:29:24,596 --> 01:29:26,137
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1088
01:29:26,297 --> 01:29:27,098
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1089
01:29:27,118 --> 01:29:29,700
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much, Marion, with all the information.

1090
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:34,684
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you just, so where do we stand with youth sports?

1091
01:29:34,704 --> 01:29:36,905
[SPEAKER_09]: Are youth sports participating now?

1092
01:29:38,106 --> 01:29:38,847
[SPEAKER_09]: Have they been approved?

1093
01:29:41,489 --> 01:29:46,271
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, so youth sports are allowed.

1094
01:29:46,291 --> 01:29:52,113
[SPEAKER_13]: There are like four levels of risk associated with different levels of sports.

1095
01:29:52,153 --> 01:30:06,778
[SPEAKER_13]: So your basketball, your hockey, your contact sports are considered higher risk sports, where football is still not really allowed unless they're just doing

1096
01:30:08,496 --> 01:30:11,138
training, workouts.

1097
01:30:11,158 --> 01:30:14,741
[SPEAKER_13]: There are different levels of risk.

1098
01:30:14,841 --> 01:30:27,951
[SPEAKER_13]: The best place for guidance on the sports is the Massachusetts Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs are really controlling and putting out the guidelines for youth sports.

1099
01:30:28,371 --> 01:30:33,715
[SPEAKER_13]: But we've been in touch with most of the youth sports programs, soccer, hockey.

1100
01:30:33,735 --> 01:30:36,497
[SPEAKER_13]: Like I said, they're allowed to do it.

1101
01:30:37,622 --> 01:30:41,324
[SPEAKER_13]: Depending on their risk level, there's certain guidelines that they have to follow.

1102
01:30:41,865 --> 01:30:43,486
[SPEAKER_08]: So LaConte rink is open then?

1103
01:30:43,506 --> 01:30:45,147
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry?

1104
01:30:45,387 --> 01:30:46,528
[SPEAKER_08]: LaConte rink is open?

1105
01:30:47,388 --> 01:30:50,830
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, yes, and hockey is open.

1106
01:30:51,551 --> 01:30:56,634
[SPEAKER_13]: But they're requested that they wear masks during face-offs, for example.

1107
01:30:56,654 --> 01:31:05,099
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, and what- And cohort to specific groups and tents, saying kids are playing all the time and not exposing other people.

1108
01:31:05,812 --> 01:31:08,373
[SPEAKER_09]: And one parent is allowed in the rink at a time with a child?

1109
01:31:09,133 --> 01:31:17,156
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, under M18, one per student, of course, per participant.

1110
01:31:17,276 --> 01:31:25,520
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, and it looks like the kindergarten are back in school with their teachers, so far.

1111
01:31:25,540 --> 01:31:26,720
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, yes.

1112
01:31:26,980 --> 01:31:28,521
[SPEAKER_13]: The kindergarten are back on Monday.

1113
01:31:29,312 --> 01:31:35,195
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so what I'm getting at, you're seeing a positive trend here moving forward.

1114
01:31:35,455 --> 01:31:45,421
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know that I asked the last subcommittee, I mean the committee, the whole meeting we had to give me some bullet points that I can present to you as a guideline.

1115
01:31:45,441 --> 01:31:51,885
[SPEAKER_09]: I had a great conversation, thanks to you, with President Asak from the Brockton City Council.

1116
01:31:52,825 --> 01:31:57,752
[SPEAKER_09]: And they enlighten me on some great avenues to take to open up the council chambers.

1117
01:31:58,133 --> 01:32:08,808
[SPEAKER_09]: She also enlightened me that the good news is we can use our COVID funding to help fund the opening for open meetings.

1118
01:32:09,769 --> 01:32:12,010
[SPEAKER_09]: like our city council meeting, so that was great news.

1119
01:32:12,070 --> 01:32:16,972
[SPEAKER_09]: So I know that I have a question later to our city solicitor to answer some of those questions.

1120
01:32:17,012 --> 01:32:25,955
[SPEAKER_09]: But now with the numbers that are increasing, I think that there's some pretty good strategies that I'd like to share with you down the line.

1121
01:32:26,396 --> 01:32:36,499
[SPEAKER_09]: If you can help me out with some of those bullets that I could share back with you to open the council chambers to a safe limit and open it to those people that

1122
01:32:38,360 --> 01:32:41,562
[SPEAKER_09]: want to come to our meetings in person.

1123
01:32:41,602 --> 01:32:47,767
[SPEAKER_09]: So my last question is, I think that, where do we stand right now with Halloween?

1124
01:32:47,807 --> 01:32:48,807
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that's going around.

1125
01:32:49,208 --> 01:32:59,595
[SPEAKER_09]: Has the mayor and the department talked about, as Halloween's coming soon, what protocols we're going to be reaching for or what that's looking like right now?

1126
01:32:59,635 --> 01:33:01,216
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that something being talked about?

1127
01:33:02,415 --> 01:33:04,156
[SPEAKER_13]: We've had a lot of discussion about Halloween.

1128
01:33:04,176 --> 01:33:12,683
[SPEAKER_13]: So certainly the CDC has put out some really great guidance around Halloween and what would be considered higher risk versus lower risk.

1129
01:33:13,664 --> 01:33:16,206
[SPEAKER_13]: I think a lot of that is what we're going to be falling back on.

1130
01:33:16,226 --> 01:33:18,788
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot of that is what the past DPH has recommended.

1131
01:33:18,868 --> 01:33:26,234
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't believe that DPH at this point, and they have said, I know the governor might have alluded to something different today, but what I can tell

1132
01:33:26,878 --> 01:33:30,821
[SPEAKER_13]: is that they're really not going to put up any strict guidelines for us.

1133
01:33:30,962 --> 01:33:35,746
[SPEAKER_13]: It's more of us going to be up to the locals.

1134
01:33:36,526 --> 01:33:43,732
[SPEAKER_13]: There are certainly safer practices than others, but the CDC guidelines are really great.

1135
01:33:43,772 --> 01:33:48,416
[SPEAKER_13]: They suggest putting out individual bags of candy on the front steps for kids to take.

1136
01:33:48,937 --> 01:33:53,040
[SPEAKER_13]: I would love to do that, but I don't think I'm going to have time to make individual bags, but I guess we're going to get there.

1137
01:33:54,270 --> 01:34:03,975
[SPEAKER_13]: But certainly, you know, being careful, like you don't want to stick a bucket of candy out for people to take by themselves because that's transmission and you don't want that to happen.

1138
01:34:03,995 --> 01:34:07,737
[SPEAKER_13]: So again, we're going to be referring to the CDC guidance.

1139
01:34:08,157 --> 01:34:13,899
[SPEAKER_13]: We're trying to come up with some fun ideas here in Medford that are going to be safe and I think people are going to like.

1140
01:34:15,552 --> 01:34:21,656
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're working on that, but we will be putting forward some guidelines as well, but most of it will be based on the CDC.

1141
01:34:21,676 --> 01:34:24,318
[SPEAKER_13]: So I would recommend people look at that website.

1142
01:34:24,358 --> 01:34:24,638
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1143
01:34:25,799 --> 01:34:25,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.

1144
01:34:26,319 --> 01:34:26,900
[SPEAKER_26]: Good for now, yeah.

1145
01:34:27,040 --> 01:34:28,301
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1146
01:34:28,321 --> 01:34:29,382
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Caraviello.

1147
01:34:30,362 --> 01:34:31,203
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1148
01:34:31,223 --> 01:34:41,350
[SPEAKER_26]: Mary Ann, where are we on our update on the three nursing homes in Medford?

1149
01:34:43,653 --> 01:34:44,454
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, great question.

1150
01:34:44,494 --> 01:34:44,834
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1151
01:34:44,854 --> 01:34:46,795
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I meant to touch on that.

1152
01:34:47,015 --> 01:34:50,918
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're still in touch with all three nursing homes.

1153
01:34:51,578 --> 01:34:58,282
[SPEAKER_13]: They are right now doing well.

1154
01:34:58,983 --> 01:35:00,544
[SPEAKER_13]: Are there any active cases?

1155
01:35:00,564 --> 01:35:04,186
[SPEAKER_13]: We have not had positive cases for residents.

1156
01:35:04,806 --> 01:35:06,187
[SPEAKER_13]: They're still testing.

1157
01:35:06,207 --> 01:35:12,231
[SPEAKER_13]: We have had a few positive cases for staff pop up within the last month or so.

1158
01:35:13,154 --> 01:35:27,565
[SPEAKER_13]: very infrequently, I want to say maybe four over the last month at the various nursing homes, but they are continually testing staff and they are continually testing residents.

1159
01:35:27,906 --> 01:35:31,849
[SPEAKER_13]: And we are there in a really good place right now, thank God.

1160
01:35:34,250 --> 01:35:38,454
[SPEAKER_26]: Is anybody monitoring the several group homes in the community?

1161
01:35:40,555 --> 01:35:40,816
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1162
01:35:41,256 --> 01:35:42,257
[SPEAKER_26]: Are they doing that on their own?

1163
01:35:43,862 --> 01:35:48,363
[SPEAKER_13]: So we are notified if there's an issue with the group home.

1164
01:35:48,684 --> 01:35:54,025
[SPEAKER_13]: And again, we have not seen anything for several months out of any of the group homes.

1165
01:35:55,946 --> 01:36:00,167
[SPEAKER_13]: Previous, if we were notified that there was a case and certainly there was follow up there.

1166
01:36:00,807 --> 01:36:04,088
[SPEAKER_13]: But again, they have been very quiet as well.

1167
01:36:05,008 --> 01:36:06,068
[SPEAKER_26]: What about the boarding houses?

1168
01:36:07,529 --> 01:36:07,789
[SPEAKER_13]: Same.

1169
01:36:08,513 --> 01:36:09,273
[SPEAKER_26]: Same thing?

1170
01:36:09,373 --> 01:36:15,115
[SPEAKER_26]: Are they policing themselves, or is your department monitoring them also?

1171
01:36:16,256 --> 01:36:22,058
[SPEAKER_13]: So we only would monitor them if we were aware of a positive case coming out of there.

1172
01:36:22,778 --> 01:36:24,678
[SPEAKER_13]: But they are up to their own guidelines.

1173
01:36:24,718 --> 01:36:28,480
[SPEAKER_13]: They know the safety protocols they're supposed to be adhering to.

1174
01:36:29,120 --> 01:36:31,421
[SPEAKER_13]: And for the most part, again, they've been quiet.

1175
01:36:31,461 --> 01:36:34,922
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're assuming that they're doing the right thing.

1176
01:36:35,042 --> 01:36:37,903
[SPEAKER_26]: Is anybody monitoring the women's health facility on Mystic Street?

1177
01:36:40,293 --> 01:36:46,236
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, that's up to them to do their own safety guidelines, attestations that they're following the rules.

1178
01:36:46,296 --> 01:36:47,457
[SPEAKER_13]: Because that isn't a neighborhood.

1179
01:36:47,837 --> 01:36:50,559
[SPEAKER_13]: Only if there was a positive case out of there.

1180
01:36:50,819 --> 01:36:52,560
[SPEAKER_26]: So again, they're monitoring themselves.

1181
01:36:52,600 --> 01:36:54,361
[SPEAKER_26]: We're not, the city is not monitoring.

1182
01:36:54,381 --> 01:37:00,305
[SPEAKER_26]: So we don't know if, because that's a live-in facility there.

1183
01:37:00,445 --> 01:37:07,909
[SPEAKER_13]: So the state has basically said that they're all up to, you know, it's not up to us as the Board of Health to go in and monitor all of these.

1184
01:37:08,109 --> 01:37:09,430
[SPEAKER_13]: That's absolutely no.

1185
01:37:10,765 --> 01:37:16,249
[SPEAKER_13]: really way that we would be able to do that, but- Well, they're a semi-medical facility.

1186
01:37:17,590 --> 01:37:23,775
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, I think they might be considered a medical facility, because they treat women with disorders.

1187
01:37:23,815 --> 01:37:27,698
[SPEAKER_26]: So, I don't know if that falls under your purview.

1188
01:37:30,063 --> 01:37:34,286
[SPEAKER_26]: Because they say there is a park across the street, and children play there.

1189
01:37:34,326 --> 01:37:38,388
[SPEAKER_26]: And some neighbors have raised some concern about that.

1190
01:37:38,408 --> 01:37:44,532
[SPEAKER_26]: And I'm just, I say, I didn't know if that falls under your, they say where they are some, they are maybe, they are a medical facility.

1191
01:37:45,032 --> 01:37:48,315
[SPEAKER_26]: You have no jurisdiction over that either?

1192
01:37:48,335 --> 01:37:54,759
[SPEAKER_13]: No, it's a state license that would fall under the state.

1193
01:37:55,219 --> 01:37:58,501
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, we would only become aware if we got a positive case out of there.

1194
01:37:59,192 --> 01:38:05,755
[SPEAKER_13]: But they are all supposed to be self-attestations, that they are following the safety guidelines and the regulations.

1195
01:38:06,975 --> 01:38:10,877
[SPEAKER_26]: And last, I appreciate all the vaccine clinics.

1196
01:38:11,337 --> 01:38:18,260
[SPEAKER_26]: If we could do, if I can make a motion on the paper that the vaccine clinics be sent out over robocall.

1197
01:38:20,115 --> 01:38:23,736
[SPEAKER_26]: Because a lot of doctors aren't seeing patients still.

1198
01:38:24,637 --> 01:38:34,581
[SPEAKER_26]: And I think in light of everybody needing a flu shot, I think they should be made aware that they can come down and get it without an appointment at the city facilities.

1199
01:38:34,901 --> 01:38:40,403
[SPEAKER_26]: And will we have enough availability of the senior dose of the flu vaccine?

1200
01:38:42,283 --> 01:38:46,065
[SPEAKER_13]: Currently we have another 100, I think 100 plus high dose.

1201
01:38:46,833 --> 01:38:49,014
[SPEAKER_13]: that's at our disposal.

1202
01:38:49,074 --> 01:38:53,817
[SPEAKER_13]: We did get quite a few at the senior clinic last week.

1203
01:38:54,157 --> 01:38:57,439
[SPEAKER_13]: So last week or the week before, I don't know.

1204
01:38:58,059 --> 01:39:02,842
[SPEAKER_13]: But we do, I believe we have 100 plus more doses of the high dose available.

1205
01:39:02,922 --> 01:39:13,708
[SPEAKER_13]: And I know our public health nurse has been doing visits to some shut-ins who have called, that we do encourage people who are, if they are unable to get out,

1206
01:39:14,264 --> 01:39:18,546
[SPEAKER_13]: to please call us and we will arrange home visits for vaccines.

1207
01:39:19,247 --> 01:39:19,527
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1208
01:39:19,747 --> 01:39:30,872
[SPEAKER_26]: I suppose, Mr. President, if I can make a motion that the flu vaccine clinics be sent out via a 911 call so that people are notified when they are and where they are.

1209
01:39:30,932 --> 01:39:33,774
[SPEAKER_26]: I see in light of many doctors' offices still being closed.

1210
01:39:35,435 --> 01:39:35,855
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes, please.

1211
01:39:38,756 --> 01:39:39,757
[SPEAKER_21]: I've got it, yeah.

1212
01:39:40,597 --> 01:39:43,579
[SPEAKER_04]: A motion offered by Vice President Caraviello, seconded by

1213
01:39:44,775 --> 01:39:47,018
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli, Clerk Hurtubise, please call the roll.

1214
01:39:48,339 --> 01:39:49,501
[SPEAKER_22]: That's a B paper, correct?

1215
01:39:49,621 --> 01:39:50,201
[SPEAKER_04]: You are correct.

1216
01:39:53,345 --> 01:39:54,707
[SPEAKER_22]: On the B paper, Councilor Bears?

1217
01:39:55,147 --> 01:39:55,447
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

1218
01:39:56,389 --> 01:39:57,350
[SPEAKER_22]: Vice President Caraviello?

1219
01:39:57,430 --> 01:39:57,770
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

1220
01:39:58,771 --> 01:39:59,412
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Knight?

1221
01:39:59,833 --> 01:40:00,133
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

1222
01:40:01,194 --> 01:40:01,815
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Marks?

1223
01:40:02,075 --> 01:40:02,396
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

1224
01:40:03,697 --> 01:40:04,338
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Morell.

1225
01:40:04,478 --> 01:40:04,718
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1226
01:40:05,358 --> 01:40:06,179
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1227
01:40:06,319 --> 01:40:06,559
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

1228
01:40:07,200 --> 01:40:07,880
[SPEAKER_22]: President Falco.

1229
01:40:08,100 --> 01:40:08,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1230
01:40:08,521 --> 01:40:10,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Seven the affirmative, zero the negative, the motion passes.

1231
01:40:10,923 --> 01:40:12,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Caballero, any other questions?

1232
01:40:13,264 --> 01:40:16,087
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, we will now go to Councilor Knight.

1233
01:40:17,408 --> 01:40:18,448
[SPEAKER_27]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1234
01:40:18,949 --> 01:40:19,109
[SPEAKER_27]: Ms.

1235
01:40:19,129 --> 01:40:31,859
[SPEAKER_27]: O'Connor, based upon the statements that you've made tonight, what is the position of the administration on sending our children back to school, number one, and what role has your office played in determining safe air quality standards in our public school buildings?

1236
01:40:34,088 --> 01:40:52,878
[SPEAKER_13]: So I've been working with the school administration, school committee, looking at metrics and what would be safe as far as metrics are concerned for whether they continue with hybrid, whether they don't.

1237
01:40:53,959 --> 01:40:59,982
[SPEAKER_13]: It's really as far as the building safety that has been pretty much the school administration

1238
01:41:01,475 --> 01:41:03,696
[SPEAKER_13]: If my opinion is asked, I certainly give it.

1239
01:41:03,756 --> 01:41:14,205
[SPEAKER_13]: But this EPA guidelines, this DPH guidelines, this DESE guidelines that the school administration has really been following closely as far as air quality goes.

1240
01:41:15,846 --> 01:41:19,749
[SPEAKER_13]: And there's this AFER guidelines as well.

1241
01:41:19,829 --> 01:41:22,731
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that is really important that they've been looking at.

1242
01:41:25,370 --> 01:41:30,111
[SPEAKER_13]: that I have not been included in those discussions with all those guidelines that they need to follow.

1243
01:41:31,111 --> 01:41:32,192
[SPEAKER_27]: They're well aware of them.

1244
01:41:32,312 --> 01:41:41,434
[SPEAKER_27]: Are you aware if the school department is using the recommendations of any medical professional in terms of their moving forward with the air quality examinations and the determination of safe standards?

1245
01:41:42,875 --> 01:41:44,615
[SPEAKER_13]: Medical professionals, I'm not sure.

1246
01:41:44,695 --> 01:41:47,496
[SPEAKER_13]: I think they're really using the HA.

1247
01:41:48,769 --> 01:41:57,534
[SPEAKER_13]: PPA, AFTRA, all of those guidelines, DESE, DPH, all of the guidelines, CDC, that have been put out there.

1248
01:41:58,274 --> 01:42:04,878
[SPEAKER_13]: As far as the equality goes, I don't know that they've considered or consulted with a medical professional.

1249
01:42:04,958 --> 01:42:08,460
[SPEAKER_27]: And what is the position of the administration relative to returning our students back to school?

1250
01:42:09,821 --> 01:42:13,683
[SPEAKER_13]: So I believe that the hybrid model has been pretty much put out there.

1251
01:42:14,549 --> 01:42:16,670
[SPEAKER_13]: And as long as the buildings are safe there.

1252
01:42:16,690 --> 01:42:23,794
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're looking at both metrics and building safety metrics as well, which includes the air quality guidelines.

1253
01:42:24,254 --> 01:42:33,239
[SPEAKER_13]: But those were really, that's probably better off certified as being the school administration, although I've been involved in creating those metrics and helping them with those.

1254
01:42:34,051 --> 01:42:42,896
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that all that they are doing so much, I think they're better served at talking to you about everything that they're doing.

1255
01:42:43,056 --> 01:42:53,442
[SPEAKER_27]: In your professional opinion, do you feel as though the school will be held in an in-person fashion at all this year, or do you think it will be hybrid and remote?

1256
01:42:55,823 --> 01:42:57,064
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a latency.

1257
01:42:58,591 --> 01:43:00,573
[SPEAKER_13]: And I know people hate that answer.

1258
01:43:00,733 --> 01:43:01,353
[SPEAKER_13]: It depends.

1259
01:43:01,493 --> 01:43:06,657
[SPEAKER_13]: But I think the remote progress that we're making so far is really great.

1260
01:43:06,997 --> 01:43:08,318
[SPEAKER_27]: You obviously don't have a child at home.

1261
01:43:08,338 --> 01:43:09,419
[SPEAKER_13]: And we'll continue.

1262
01:43:09,539 --> 01:43:16,604
[SPEAKER_13]: But really, the case counts and the metrics and where we're at will determine whether we go forward or backward.

1263
01:43:16,945 --> 01:43:17,185
[SPEAKER_27]: All right.

1264
01:43:17,205 --> 01:43:18,486
[SPEAKER_27]: So as of right now, we really don't know.

1265
01:43:21,308 --> 01:43:22,068
[SPEAKER_11]: It's waiting to see.

1266
01:43:22,529 --> 01:43:23,730
[SPEAKER_11]: But right now, it's planned.

1267
01:43:23,770 --> 01:43:24,650
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going forward.

1268
01:43:24,690 --> 01:43:25,491
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think that's good.

1269
01:43:26,616 --> 01:43:31,297
[SPEAKER_27]: And Mr. President, I'd like to also offer a C paper because Councilor Caraviello beat me to the punch on the B paper.

1270
01:43:32,357 --> 01:43:45,161
[SPEAKER_27]: But this C paper would be an ordinance, Mr. President, an emergency ordinance that would say that any school department or city employee who is required to quarantine due to occupational exposure to COVID-19 be placed on paid administrative leave.

1271
01:43:46,587 --> 01:43:51,649
[SPEAKER_27]: as opposed to having to use their sick time or their vacation time or their recruiting time, Mr. President.

1272
01:43:51,989 --> 01:43:53,350
[SPEAKER_27]: It's an occupational exposure.

1273
01:43:53,390 --> 01:43:56,091
[SPEAKER_27]: It's something that's happened because they're trying to perform the duties of their job.

1274
01:43:57,032 --> 01:44:04,935
[SPEAKER_27]: And if that case happens, I don't think it's fair that these individuals should be punished by having to use their sick or vacation time in order to quarantine during these periods of time.

1275
01:44:04,955 --> 01:44:08,317
[SPEAKER_27]: So I'd ask that that C paper be forwarded to the city solicitor for her to draft up.

1276
01:44:08,877 --> 01:44:16,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so on the seat paper offered by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, Clerk Hurtubise, do you have the language of that paper?

1277
01:44:20,464 --> 01:44:24,066
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. President, here's what I have.

1278
01:44:24,186 --> 01:44:34,493
[SPEAKER_22]: It's a seat paper, it's an emergency ordinance that any school employee or municipal employee who has to quarantine because of COVID be placed on paid administrative leave rather than on sick time.

1279
01:44:35,060 --> 01:44:35,240
[SPEAKER_27]: No.

1280
01:44:36,421 --> 01:44:41,723
[SPEAKER_27]: Any school department or city employee required to quarantine due to occupational exposure to COVID-19?

1281
01:44:41,743 --> 01:44:42,723
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, hang on.

1282
01:44:42,843 --> 01:44:47,425
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe that's our position as a city.

1283
01:44:48,286 --> 01:44:55,049
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know what we're speaking about, so I'm sorry, but I believe that's the way we're handling it now.

1284
01:44:55,109 --> 01:44:59,230
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, we have Dave Rodriguez, the Chief of Staff, has got his hand up.

1285
01:44:59,250 --> 01:45:00,531
[SPEAKER_04]: Dave, could you please weigh in on that?

1286
01:45:01,465 --> 01:45:01,825
[SPEAKER_20]: Sure thing.

1287
01:45:01,845 --> 01:45:04,367
[SPEAKER_20]: That's been the policy administration since the beginning of COVID.

1288
01:45:04,387 --> 01:45:22,356
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's something that we've engaged with the collective bargaining units on the city side from almost minute one from this, that there is a presumption that if an individual is tested positive, that we presume that it is an occupational hazard, it is an occupational contagion.

1289
01:45:22,896 --> 01:45:24,897
[SPEAKER_20]: for the city side.

1290
01:45:48,263 --> 01:45:51,665
[SPEAKER_20]: I can't speak for the school board, I can speak to them about it.

1291
01:45:52,246 --> 01:45:59,991
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a little bit different because of the employee, how the employees have been in attendance since March, but I can certainly speak with them and see what their policy is.

1292
01:46:02,073 --> 01:46:11,439
[SPEAKER_27]: Seems like it's a public policy initiative that's generally accepted by the administration, Mr. President, so I see no harm in memorializing that by way of an emergency ordinance.

1293
01:46:12,160 --> 01:46:17,604
[SPEAKER_04]: Clerk Carter, did you have the wording of Councilor Knight's resolution?

1294
01:46:18,359 --> 01:46:20,960
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, let me let me read it back one more time.

1295
01:46:20,980 --> 01:46:35,965
[SPEAKER_22]: Just make sure any school so that it's an emergency ordinance that any school employee or municipal employee who has to quarantine because of occupational exposure to covid be placed on paid administrative leave rather than sick time.

1296
01:46:36,806 --> 01:46:38,846
[SPEAKER_27]: Just administrative leave doesn't have to be rather than anything else.

1297
01:46:38,866 --> 01:46:39,207
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay.

1298
01:46:41,049 --> 01:46:45,431
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, on that, so that is a C paper offered by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarborough.

1299
01:46:45,512 --> 01:46:49,554
[SPEAKER_27]: Mr. President, I'd like that to go to the city solicit of a legal review and drafting, you know.

1300
01:46:49,594 --> 01:46:52,576
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, do you have that, Clerk Hurtubise?

1301
01:46:53,176 --> 01:46:53,436
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

1302
01:46:53,816 --> 01:46:54,076
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1303
01:46:56,658 --> 01:46:59,740
[SPEAKER_04]: On that motion, Clerk Hurtubise, please call the roll.

1304
01:47:01,901 --> 01:47:02,461
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Bears?

1305
01:47:02,741 --> 01:47:03,082
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

1306
01:47:03,842 --> 01:47:04,863
[SPEAKER_22]: Vice President Caraviello?

1307
01:47:04,943 --> 01:47:05,203
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

1308
01:47:06,260 --> 01:47:06,821
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Knight.

1309
01:47:06,861 --> 01:47:07,301
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

1310
01:47:07,902 --> 01:47:08,502
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Marks.

1311
01:47:08,602 --> 01:47:08,943
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1312
01:47:09,864 --> 01:47:10,564
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Morell.

1313
01:47:10,785 --> 01:47:11,045
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1314
01:47:11,906 --> 01:47:12,727
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1315
01:47:12,747 --> 01:47:13,027
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

1316
01:47:13,748 --> 01:47:14,368
[SPEAKER_22]: President Favella.

1317
01:47:14,628 --> 01:47:14,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1318
01:47:14,889 --> 01:47:17,171
[SPEAKER_04]: Senator the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

1319
01:47:18,652 --> 01:47:20,775
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight, did you have any further questions?

1320
01:47:21,115 --> 01:47:22,136
[SPEAKER_27]: That does it for me, Mr. President.

1321
01:47:22,256 --> 01:47:23,858
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, are there any other further questions?

1322
01:47:24,138 --> 01:47:24,839
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Marks.

1323
01:47:26,766 --> 01:47:27,707
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1324
01:47:27,727 --> 01:47:33,029
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to thank Marianne for her commitment to this city over the last seven months.

1325
01:47:33,650 --> 01:47:37,272
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been very trying, and she's been a leader in this community.

1326
01:47:37,312 --> 01:47:38,172
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate that.

1327
01:47:38,853 --> 01:47:44,896
[SPEAKER_02]: Marianne, have you had any involvement with the outside rentals of our school buildings?

1328
01:47:47,037 --> 01:47:48,898
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, I have.

1329
01:47:49,839 --> 01:47:51,720
[SPEAKER_13]: Most of them, or all of them.

1330
01:47:55,336 --> 01:48:11,352
[SPEAKER_13]: present their plans to my department, to me, and then in conjunction with the schools, as far as follow up, as far as cleaning and disinfecting of areas after use, and all of those plans are submitted to me for approval.

1331
01:48:12,560 --> 01:48:27,191
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so what type of contact tracing is being done by the city or what systems are in place to monitor the size of the groups and the purpose of which they're using our buildings?

1332
01:48:27,711 --> 01:48:32,015
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that being done by your office or is that being done, it is?

1333
01:48:32,055 --> 01:48:32,935
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, yes.

1334
01:48:33,496 --> 01:48:38,279
[SPEAKER_13]: So again, including in their plans would have to be how they are

1335
01:48:40,186 --> 01:48:41,227
[SPEAKER_13]: have to keep up with that.

1336
01:49:02,292 --> 01:49:07,215
[SPEAKER_13]: But whatever the occupancy rates are that are allowed, their plans have to be submitted to me.

1337
01:49:07,715 --> 01:49:20,742
[SPEAKER_13]: How they're going to monitor that, how they're going to pre-register people and register people so we know who's actually there, because that's really important when it comes, if anything happens to contact tracing, we need to know who was present in the facility.

1338
01:49:20,782 --> 01:49:26,925
[SPEAKER_13]: So they're all required to do registration forms, sign up forms with names, addresses, and phone numbers.

1339
01:49:27,389 --> 01:49:29,311
[SPEAKER_13]: So we can contact trace if need be.

1340
01:49:29,851 --> 01:49:37,538
[SPEAKER_13]: And then again, the follow up on this facility part as to how the cleaning and disinfecting is gonna take place after use.

1341
01:49:38,539 --> 01:49:38,719
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1342
01:49:39,319 --> 01:49:43,963
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any actual testing COVID testing being required?

1343
01:49:43,983 --> 01:49:47,887
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

1344
01:49:47,987 --> 01:49:55,093
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't know if we're welcoming anyone from an outside group into our buildings that may be infected.

1345
01:49:55,919 --> 01:49:56,780
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, you can't do that.

1346
01:49:57,020 --> 01:50:00,102
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, we don't do that for any public facility, right?

1347
01:50:00,122 --> 01:50:07,368
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, the hairdressers or the barbershop or whatever, nobody's gonna come contact our tested prior to entry.

1348
01:50:07,388 --> 01:50:10,771
[SPEAKER_13]: But yes, no, that's not a requirement.

1349
01:50:10,811 --> 01:50:12,012
[SPEAKER_13]: That's not in the guidelines.

1350
01:50:12,032 --> 01:50:18,858
[SPEAKER_13]: That's not in the state guidelines that they require a COVID test prior to entering the facility.

1351
01:50:19,198 --> 01:50:19,378
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

1352
01:50:19,398 --> 01:50:21,320
[SPEAKER_02]: What about a temperature test?

1353
01:50:22,213 --> 01:50:23,334
[SPEAKER_02]: taking someone's temperature.

1354
01:50:23,434 --> 01:50:41,203
[SPEAKER_13]: That's, you know, some places do do that, but that's really not looked at as a good measure or a good, you know, a real measure, I should say, not a good measure, a real measure of

1355
01:50:43,537 --> 01:51:03,730
[SPEAKER_02]: So as the health director, and I don't mean to put you on the spot, and if you don't want to answer, you don't have to, but what's your personal thought about entertaining activities in a building we're trying to lock down for safety reasons, inviting people from the public into these buildings?

1356
01:51:04,331 --> 01:51:05,812
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your personal thought on that?

1357
01:51:07,332 --> 01:51:20,734
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, as long as the guidelines are followed, as long as the protocols are followed, and as long as, certainly, I know there are strict restrictions as far as they are not allowed to go anywhere else in the building.

1358
01:51:20,754 --> 01:51:28,916
[SPEAKER_13]: If this is where they're going, there are staffs jamming in to make sure that they do not go anywhere else in the building or use any other rooms in the building.

1359
01:51:28,956 --> 01:51:35,517
[SPEAKER_13]: So as long as the guidelines and protocols are being followed, and then the cleaning and disinfecting

1360
01:51:36,158 --> 01:51:37,599
[SPEAKER_13]: takes place afterwards.

1361
01:51:38,640 --> 01:51:39,720
[SPEAKER_04]: Point of information, Mr. President.

1362
01:51:40,060 --> 01:51:42,142
[SPEAKER_26]: Point of information, Vice President Caraviello.

1363
01:51:42,162 --> 01:51:42,862
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1364
01:51:42,962 --> 01:51:47,605
[SPEAKER_26]: Marianne, who's monitoring, who's monitoring that at the high school, at the schools?

1365
01:51:48,406 --> 01:51:50,347
[SPEAKER_13]: Security personnel and our custodian.

1366
01:51:50,367 --> 01:51:54,550
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, so they're there every time there's another group there?

1367
01:51:54,950 --> 01:51:56,351
[SPEAKER_26]: They're there on site?

1368
01:51:57,031 --> 01:51:57,271
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1369
01:51:57,952 --> 01:52:02,815
[SPEAKER_13]: Monitoring and making sure that no other part of the building is used, that they don't go any further.

1370
01:52:03,271 --> 01:52:10,054
[SPEAKER_13]: and that they're fully responsible for cleaning and disinfecting after every use prior to anybody else walking in.

1371
01:52:10,094 --> 01:52:12,895
[SPEAKER_26]: How many security personnel are there when they're in there?

1372
01:52:14,656 --> 01:52:15,656
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

1373
01:52:15,676 --> 01:52:16,417
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't tell you that.

1374
01:52:16,437 --> 01:52:16,917
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

1375
01:52:18,518 --> 01:52:23,920
[SPEAKER_13]: But I don't see the custodial or whatever they use for the security personnel.

1376
01:52:23,960 --> 01:52:28,122
[SPEAKER_13]: But they are there to restrict access anywhere else in the building.

1377
01:52:28,702 --> 01:52:28,942
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1378
01:52:30,280 --> 01:52:45,711
[SPEAKER_02]: So Mary, just so I understand, and I don't want to beat a dead horse, but if we had an issue of a student contracting COVID that we know was, or a teacher, or faculty, whoever it might be, that was in the Marsha Karen Little Theater.

1379
01:52:46,491 --> 01:52:57,659
[SPEAKER_02]: And the previous day, there was, or the day after, there was 75 people from an outside organization using the Marsha Karen Theater.

1380
01:52:59,620 --> 01:53:06,165
[SPEAKER_02]: contact every person that we have on record that was in that particular part of the building.

1381
01:53:10,648 --> 01:53:14,871
[SPEAKER_13]: So you have to be a contact of that person.

1382
01:53:15,551 --> 01:53:19,534
[SPEAKER_13]: So just because you're in the building where someone tested positive.

1383
01:53:19,934 --> 01:53:21,535
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what about in a particular area?

1384
01:53:21,555 --> 01:53:24,517
[SPEAKER_13]: You have to be within six feet of a confirmed case.

1385
01:53:29,298 --> 01:53:31,038
[SPEAKER_13]: for 15 minutes or longer.

1386
01:53:32,059 --> 01:53:40,781
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you're in the same room that someone was in the day before and that room's been disinfected, that doesn't make you a contact.

1387
01:53:41,161 --> 01:53:53,544
[SPEAKER_13]: The only way you're a contact is if you are directly with someone who becomes a known confirmed case within six feet for 15 minutes or longer.

1388
01:53:55,433 --> 01:54:01,556
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's where the room situation isn't really so much of a factor.

1389
01:54:01,636 --> 01:54:03,356
[SPEAKER_13]: Does that make sense?

1390
01:54:03,676 --> 01:54:04,377
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate that.

1391
01:54:04,417 --> 01:54:14,441
[SPEAKER_02]: So that doesn't make you eligible for contact tracing, although it could make you eligible for getting the COVID virus, correct?

1392
01:54:15,121 --> 01:54:22,164
[SPEAKER_13]: But so if someone was at that church service that was in that room, and they became positive,

1393
01:54:23,325 --> 01:54:27,027
[SPEAKER_13]: And we found out they were in that room, and they became positive at that church service.

1394
01:54:27,507 --> 01:54:35,012
[SPEAKER_13]: What we would be most concerned about is who was within six feet of that person for longer than 15 minutes.

1395
01:54:35,032 --> 01:54:37,653
[SPEAKER_13]: But I'm concerned about the entire room.

1396
01:54:38,194 --> 01:54:43,937
[SPEAKER_13]: We're only concerned about people who have been around that person within six feet for 15 minutes or longer.

1397
01:54:44,337 --> 01:54:48,420
[SPEAKER_02]: So you wouldn't be concerned the following day that students may be using that exact room?

1398
01:54:49,171 --> 01:54:50,833
[SPEAKER_13]: Not at all.

1399
01:54:51,373 --> 01:54:52,034
[SPEAKER_13]: Not at all?

1400
01:54:52,254 --> 01:54:53,775
[SPEAKER_13]: Not at all.

1401
01:54:55,137 --> 01:54:56,198
[SPEAKER_09]: Point of information if I can.

1402
01:54:56,418 --> 01:54:57,819
[SPEAKER_04]: Point of information, Councilor Scott.

1403
01:54:57,839 --> 01:54:58,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead.

1404
01:54:58,660 --> 01:55:08,369
[SPEAKER_09]: Mary Ann, I know that when we do our programs and we have the same situations where we bring in large crowds and so are you telling me that it's the custodian?

1405
01:55:09,999 --> 01:55:19,706
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm assuming that anybody that comes into our buildings for contact tracing, we have a log for everybody that comes in through that entrance.

1406
01:55:20,127 --> 01:55:23,809
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have a name, a phone number, and an email address, correct?

1407
01:55:24,130 --> 01:55:24,390
[SPEAKER_09]: Correct.

1408
01:55:24,790 --> 01:55:25,010
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1409
01:55:25,250 --> 01:55:26,571
[SPEAKER_09]: So do we have those logs?

1410
01:55:27,312 --> 01:55:27,532
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1411
01:55:27,912 --> 01:55:35,358
[SPEAKER_13]: If they're using that building, they're required to have all that information for anyone who was in attendance that day.

1412
01:55:35,798 --> 01:55:38,420
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for your registration, actually.

1413
01:55:40,495 --> 01:55:43,356
[SPEAKER_09]: So our custodians have those locks?

1414
01:55:43,416 --> 01:55:43,937
[SPEAKER_09]: Who has them?

1415
01:55:44,797 --> 01:55:45,837
[SPEAKER_13]: No, no, no.

1416
01:55:45,877 --> 01:55:50,539
[SPEAKER_13]: The actual church people have those locks.

1417
01:55:51,059 --> 01:55:56,461
[SPEAKER_13]: So if I need to call them back and say, who's in there at that time, they can provide me with that information.

1418
01:55:56,902 --> 01:56:01,983
[SPEAKER_09]: That frightens me, because we do that with our Board of Health next door.

1419
01:56:04,927 --> 01:56:11,555
[SPEAKER_09]: You know how private and shaky some of these organizations are, that they sort of protect each other.

1420
01:56:12,015 --> 01:56:15,639
[SPEAKER_09]: I find it amazing that we don't have, as they walk through the doors,

1421
01:56:16,658 --> 01:56:25,143
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a simple check-in where we have clean pens, and then we have pens that are put into a separate area to be disinfected.

1422
01:56:25,664 --> 01:56:30,807
[SPEAKER_09]: And everybody comes in and signs that, and we hold on to that information.

1423
01:56:31,628 --> 01:56:38,052
[SPEAKER_09]: And if anything comes back from that church organization, that we know that we're contacting those people.

1424
01:56:40,312 --> 01:56:54,096
[SPEAKER_09]: I find it hard to believe that we trust outside organizations that want to keep that position in our facilities for future programming, that we would allow them to do that.

1425
01:56:54,116 --> 01:56:59,077
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope we consider that, because that's frightening to me.

1426
01:57:01,958 --> 01:57:02,298
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1427
01:57:04,338 --> 01:57:05,499
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1428
01:57:08,817 --> 01:57:11,338
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if Councilmax is done.

1429
01:57:11,358 --> 01:57:14,139
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilmax, you're at the floor, so I'm not sure if you had any further questions.

1430
01:57:14,199 --> 01:57:16,200
[SPEAKER_02]: Just one last follow up to Mary Ann.

1431
01:57:16,800 --> 01:57:30,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe if Mary Ann can provide us over the next week or so, Mr. President, just the number of organizations, what building they're using, the capacity of the numbers that they have.

1432
01:57:32,125 --> 01:57:36,467
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't need to see names, but I would like to see how many people use in the buildings.

1433
01:57:37,088 --> 01:57:48,193
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would like to see what the protocol is for these groups, Mr. President, regarding the contact tracing, the availability of information.

1434
01:57:49,253 --> 01:57:59,198
[SPEAKER_02]: And as I stated in the past, Mr. President, during COVID, to me, doesn't make any sense at all to invite people that would never typically be in that building.

1435
01:57:59,858 --> 01:58:09,123
[SPEAKER_02]: into a building that we're trying to secure for our faculty and our teachers and our students, that we're trying to safeguard and secure, Mr. President.

1436
01:58:09,483 --> 01:58:14,046
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes no sense why you would want to invite that at that particular time, Mr. President.

1437
01:58:14,386 --> 01:58:22,371
[SPEAKER_02]: I realize it's a revenue generator, but safety should come first, as the Board of Health Director mentioned, and that doesn't seem like safety first to me.

1438
01:58:23,091 --> 01:58:23,451
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1439
01:58:23,771 --> 01:58:24,092
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1440
01:58:24,112 --> 01:58:26,433
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President.

1441
01:58:26,974 --> 01:58:28,255
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scott Miller.

1442
01:58:28,315 --> 01:58:28,655
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1443
01:58:28,675 --> 01:58:29,576
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm hearing it again.

1444
01:58:29,636 --> 01:58:32,639
[SPEAKER_09]: I, again, I don't, I hope you don't take this.

1445
01:58:32,659 --> 01:58:34,100
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not, I appreciate.

1446
01:58:34,180 --> 01:58:37,823
[SPEAKER_13]: I just, I appreciate everything you're doing, but I, I,

1447
01:58:44,793 --> 01:58:47,734
[SPEAKER_09]: And don't take this the wrong way, but it seems like there's a double standard.

1448
01:58:47,754 --> 01:58:56,258
[SPEAKER_09]: We met the other day, and you were so adamantly against opening up these chambers because of the fear of overcrowding.

1449
01:58:56,738 --> 01:59:07,803
[SPEAKER_09]: But at the same time, what you just said with these outside organizations, as passive as, as long as they keep six feet apart for 15 minutes, that's acceptable.

1450
01:59:07,863 --> 01:59:08,003
[SPEAKER_09]: So-.

1451
01:59:12,792 --> 01:59:16,474
[SPEAKER_13]: So you're confusing, maybe I'm confusing you, I'm sorry.

1452
01:59:17,294 --> 01:59:22,456
[SPEAKER_13]: But there are specific guidelines and protocols if they're going to use these facilities.

1453
01:59:22,937 --> 01:59:34,162
[SPEAKER_13]: There are occupancy rates, there are specific guidelines and protocols and things that they must submit to this office and that we do follow up on and make sure they are adhering to.

1454
01:59:34,762 --> 01:59:39,044
[SPEAKER_13]: So the six feet 15, that's for contact tracing.

1455
01:59:39,620 --> 01:59:48,744
[SPEAKER_13]: So please do not think that we are allowing anybody and anyone to walk into these buildings and use these facilities that we know our students are going into.

1456
01:59:49,085 --> 01:59:54,487
[SPEAKER_13]: We are very adamant about what safety plans are in place and how we are monitoring them.

1457
01:59:54,527 --> 02:00:00,190
[SPEAKER_13]: And then we know that their registration process is in place and that if we need to contact Tracy, we will.

1458
02:00:00,630 --> 02:00:06,153
[SPEAKER_13]: So please do not misconstrue or maybe I'm confusing the two jobs.

1459
02:00:07,089 --> 02:00:11,950
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, maybe you are, but I'm just, as I'm moving forward, because I'm trying to put two pieces together.

1460
02:00:12,470 --> 02:00:17,011
[SPEAKER_09]: You asked me to put a plan in place to find a way to open these chambers.

1461
02:00:17,691 --> 02:00:23,852
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm trying to figure out, because I asked help from our office, because I'm not in a public health background.

1462
02:00:23,892 --> 02:00:28,793
[SPEAKER_09]: So I asked for just bullet points that can help me with that, and I hope you can maybe sometime during this week.

1463
02:00:28,853 --> 02:00:34,434
[SPEAKER_09]: But what I'm trying to get at is just, if I present

1464
02:00:35,174 --> 02:00:51,324
[SPEAKER_09]: with the president, the rest of the council, a plan in place that has these new guidelines that this now new phase is brought in with what I can Google the partners that we have and that are using our facilities that got approval.

1465
02:00:51,844 --> 02:01:00,130
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't mean to sound as trivial as it's going to sound, but if it's that easy, then

1466
02:01:01,115 --> 02:01:02,055
[SPEAKER_09]: It sounds that easy.

1467
02:01:03,016 --> 02:01:09,178
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not being disrespectful in a way just to let other organizations in and then limit this.

1468
02:01:11,858 --> 02:01:14,599
[SPEAKER_13]: So public health guidelines are one thing, right?

1469
02:01:14,979 --> 02:01:15,500
[SPEAKER_13]: That's fine.

1470
02:01:15,800 --> 02:01:16,460
[SPEAKER_13]: We can do that.

1471
02:01:17,680 --> 02:01:22,782
[SPEAKER_13]: And again, Kim was on the meeting because of the open meeting.

1472
02:01:22,942 --> 02:01:24,002
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not a lawyer.

1473
02:01:24,042 --> 02:01:25,483
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a different.

1474
02:01:25,683 --> 02:01:28,544
[SPEAKER_13]: We can certainly, yeah, with the guidelines and stuff.

1475
02:01:28,584 --> 02:01:28,744
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

1476
02:01:29,537 --> 02:01:32,518
[SPEAKER_13]: You can go to Chevalier and have 250 people there, right?

1477
02:01:32,778 --> 02:01:37,641
[SPEAKER_13]: But the open meeting law is the open meeting law, and that's not my ballot.

1478
02:01:37,681 --> 02:01:40,062
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not the issue.

1479
02:01:40,102 --> 02:01:41,082
[SPEAKER_09]: No, but that's great.

1480
02:01:41,162 --> 02:01:48,425
[SPEAKER_13]: So we can do public health safety protocols, but those other groups aren't subject to the open meeting law.

1481
02:01:48,665 --> 02:01:49,486
[SPEAKER_09]: No, that's great.

1482
02:01:49,526 --> 02:01:52,787
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'll get to that later on in the meeting today, but that's a great answer.

1483
02:01:52,807 --> 02:01:53,127
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all.

1484
02:01:54,628 --> 02:02:03,430
[SPEAKER_09]: No, that's great, that's a great answer because I think that that piece of the public health side to open this chamber, that's one of the two components we had a crossroads with last week.

1485
02:02:03,450 --> 02:02:14,152
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you for enlightening me, and like I said, I'll go forward with Councilor Scanlon with the open meetings issues and concerns that we have.

1486
02:02:14,232 --> 02:02:14,792
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, thank you.

1487
02:02:16,312 --> 02:02:16,873
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor.

1488
02:02:16,893 --> 02:02:18,753
[SPEAKER_04]: Scarpelli, are there any other questions from the council?

1489
02:02:20,077 --> 02:02:21,957
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, we have a few people that wanna speak of us.

1490
02:02:21,977 --> 02:02:25,398
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, we have Shalene Douglas.

1491
02:02:25,478 --> 02:02:26,938
[SPEAKER_04]: Name and address for the record, please.

1492
02:02:26,998 --> 02:02:28,199
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to, oh, there you go.

1493
02:02:29,819 --> 02:02:36,740
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, Shalene Douglas, president of the Method Teacher Association, 414 High Street, Method Mass.

1494
02:02:37,721 --> 02:02:43,322
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you, Maryann, for answering a lot of the questions tonight, and it was quite informative.

1495
02:02:44,262 --> 02:02:49,763
[SPEAKER_10]: And thank you to the council for clearing up some concerns that we have as teachers.

1496
02:02:50,916 --> 02:02:52,697
[SPEAKER_10]: and staff at the public schools.

1497
02:02:53,597 --> 02:02:58,660
[SPEAKER_10]: So one of the things that you stated tonight, Mary Ann, and I just wanted to clarify, I have two questions for you.

1498
02:02:58,760 --> 02:03:05,763
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the questions, one of the things you stated tonight was the mandatory testing that would be taking place at the high school.

1499
02:03:06,203 --> 02:03:17,108
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to go on record and state that the only people that are being mandated that have an agreement are the teachers, the MTA teacher staff, and the

1500
02:03:19,156 --> 02:03:21,738
[SPEAKER_10]: are the only people that I am aware of.

1501
02:03:22,118 --> 02:03:27,181
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that the other unions have not agreed.

1502
02:03:27,321 --> 02:03:33,404
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think we need to make sure that everyone understands that.

1503
02:03:33,785 --> 02:03:35,766
[SPEAKER_10]: And then my other question to you is this.

1504
02:03:36,226 --> 02:03:46,392
[SPEAKER_10]: So when someone, and also we just received an email that we do have another positive test at the high school that is traced back to

1505
02:03:47,034 --> 02:03:48,395
[SPEAKER_10]: what has happened, okay?

1506
02:03:48,555 --> 02:03:51,937
[SPEAKER_10]: So I don't know if you know that, but we just received an email to that event.

1507
02:03:53,278 --> 02:04:13,531
[SPEAKER_10]: So my other question to you is, so when these people who have tested positive, and when they are due to come back after their 10-day quarantine or whenever they're due, when they are due to come back, are they required to show a negative test so that we know that they are safe to come back into the building?

1508
02:04:15,302 --> 02:04:22,404
[SPEAKER_13]: So actually, I know it sounds contradictory, but no.

1509
02:04:22,464 --> 02:04:23,645
[SPEAKER_13]: They are not because.

1510
02:04:24,445 --> 02:04:34,708
[SPEAKER_13]: Once you test positive, so the valid is after 10 days, your infectious period is minimal.

1511
02:04:35,028 --> 02:04:37,129
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, that's what the science has shown us.

1512
02:04:37,822 --> 02:04:45,088
[SPEAKER_13]: If you retest, you are going to have RNA, protein, whatever, still hanging around your body.

1513
02:04:45,148 --> 02:04:46,549
[SPEAKER_13]: It doesn't mean you're infectious.

1514
02:04:46,910 --> 02:04:51,213
[SPEAKER_13]: But you could test positive again for weeks, all right?

1515
02:04:51,654 --> 02:04:52,955
[SPEAKER_13]: But you're not infectious.

1516
02:04:52,975 --> 02:04:56,118
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's why they went away from that to go back to work.

1517
02:04:56,138 --> 02:05:01,602
[SPEAKER_13]: We needed a negative test to go back, because that was found to be not helpful.

1518
02:05:02,623 --> 02:05:05,606
[SPEAKER_13]: So the science is, after four days,

1519
02:05:06,668 --> 02:05:10,471
And you are fever free for 24 hours.

1520
02:05:11,292 --> 02:05:14,675
Then you are no longer in that infectious state.

1521
02:05:15,395 --> 02:05:16,896
[SPEAKER_13]: And you are able to return.

1522
02:05:18,858 --> 02:05:22,381
[SPEAKER_13]: You will not probably get a negative test for quite a while.

1523
02:05:23,662 --> 02:05:26,104
[SPEAKER_13]: So I guess I'm like dead viral.

1524
02:05:28,182 --> 02:05:36,548
[SPEAKER_10]: So my concern is, you know, and for the students, you know, people in there, I'm just really, really concerned.

1525
02:05:37,529 --> 02:05:39,290
[SPEAKER_10]: It blows my mind.

1526
02:05:39,310 --> 02:05:40,931
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just, I'm very, very concerned.

1527
02:05:40,951 --> 02:05:54,021
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just think that we need to, I don't know if that's the, that's the rules and that's the rules, but I am really concerned that we will be having people return and we don't know

1528
02:05:54,937 --> 02:05:57,198
[SPEAKER_10]: some sort of, you know, safety measures.

1529
02:05:57,278 --> 02:05:58,798
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's, and that's a concern.

1530
02:05:58,918 --> 02:06:04,659
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a genuine concern, and I think I can even see that you're agreeing with me on that.

1531
02:06:04,699 --> 02:06:05,559
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, absolutely.

1532
02:06:05,599 --> 02:06:19,402
[SPEAKER_13]: But, you know, part of the contact tracing is before anyone returns back to work, we interview them again, you know, make sure that their symptoms have improved, if not resolved, and make sure that they've been fever free.

1533
02:06:19,922 --> 02:06:22,983
[SPEAKER_13]: And again, the CDC, the science is telling us that.

1534
02:06:23,652 --> 02:06:29,936
[SPEAKER_13]: that 10-day mark, as long as, you know, if they were hospitalized, that's a totally different story, right?

1535
02:06:30,277 --> 02:06:34,840
[SPEAKER_13]: We're talking about people who have had mild or moderate symptoms.

1536
02:06:36,041 --> 02:06:47,428
[SPEAKER_13]: So after that 10-day mark, if they have improved and they're fever-free for 24 hours, they are no longer infectious.

1537
02:06:48,529 --> 02:06:51,251
[SPEAKER_10]: So I guess my question is, how do we know they're fever-free?

1538
02:06:52,028 --> 02:06:53,629
[SPEAKER_10]: How do we know that they've improved?

1539
02:06:54,370 --> 02:06:55,491
[SPEAKER_10]: Do we just have to trust them?

1540
02:06:55,591 --> 02:06:56,411
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that what we're saying?

1541
02:06:57,012 --> 02:06:58,093
[SPEAKER_13]: Unfortunately, yeah, we do.

1542
02:06:59,173 --> 02:06:59,894
[SPEAKER_13]: But you know what?

1543
02:06:59,994 --> 02:07:06,719
[SPEAKER_13]: I've had one teacher who came out of the first test who's called me every day since and has been very honest and very diligent.

1544
02:07:06,739 --> 02:07:11,483
[SPEAKER_13]: And we kept him out a few days extra, because he was like, yeah, I'm still not feeling all that great.

1545
02:07:11,503 --> 02:07:14,105
[SPEAKER_13]: I haven't had a fever, but I'm just, you know, filled.

1546
02:07:14,185 --> 02:07:15,626
[SPEAKER_13]: It's felt like, don't go back.

1547
02:07:15,946 --> 02:07:16,626
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't go back.

1548
02:07:16,747 --> 02:07:19,989
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think for the most part, people are going to do better.

1549
02:07:20,421 --> 02:07:21,402
[SPEAKER_10]: I have to trust them.

1550
02:07:22,143 --> 02:07:22,783
[SPEAKER_10]: I agree.

1551
02:07:22,823 --> 02:07:24,264
[SPEAKER_10]: We do have to trust people with that.

1552
02:07:24,685 --> 02:07:24,965
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1553
02:07:25,065 --> 02:07:28,048
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I have a question regarding the rentals.

1554
02:07:28,568 --> 02:07:31,050
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, there was a lot of great points brought up tonight.

1555
02:07:31,431 --> 02:07:33,873
[SPEAKER_10]: And I guess one of the main concerns I have is

1556
02:07:34,529 --> 02:07:37,612
[SPEAKER_10]: A, that I have never seen these rental protocols.

1557
02:07:37,892 --> 02:07:40,915
[SPEAKER_10]: I would love to have those voted to me as the union president.

1558
02:07:41,335 --> 02:07:44,217
[SPEAKER_10]: I have asked for that, so if I could get that, that would be wonderful.

1559
02:07:44,678 --> 02:07:47,040
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I also- Point of information, Mr. President.

1560
02:07:47,060 --> 02:07:48,421
[SPEAKER_10]: Point of information.

1561
02:07:48,461 --> 02:07:57,769
[SPEAKER_27]: The thing that's taking place- The information that the speaker is requesting is not under our scope and purview, so we don't have the ability to provide that.

1562
02:08:00,233 --> 02:08:04,476
[SPEAKER_27]: The information that the speaker is requesting is not under the scope and purview of the council.

1563
02:08:04,556 --> 02:08:07,318
[SPEAKER_27]: That information is under the scope and purview of the school department.

1564
02:08:07,958 --> 02:08:12,521
[SPEAKER_27]: And I know that the teachers union has a lot of concerns and a lot of questions.

1565
02:08:13,602 --> 02:08:21,427
[SPEAKER_27]: And maybe it would be more appropriate for the union to meet with the director of health in a side meeting on this, because I think- So Adam, I hear what you're saying.

1566
02:08:21,447 --> 02:08:24,930
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess I just want to make sure that we have the cleaning laws and that's it.

1567
02:08:25,210 --> 02:08:26,230
[SPEAKER_10]: So those are my questions.

1568
02:08:26,270 --> 02:08:27,211
[SPEAKER_10]: Those are my concerns.

1569
02:08:27,731 --> 02:08:28,012
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1570
02:08:29,733 --> 02:08:30,553
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Charlene.

1571
02:08:32,054 --> 02:08:32,795
[SPEAKER_27]: Councilman, are you all done?

1572
02:08:33,135 --> 02:08:33,935
[SPEAKER_27]: That was it, Mr. President.

1573
02:08:33,955 --> 02:08:40,019
[SPEAKER_27]: I just thought we were kind of going off a little away from a council meeting and a little bit more into negotiation at that point in time.

1574
02:08:40,900 --> 02:08:41,180
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1575
02:08:41,420 --> 02:08:46,283
[SPEAKER_26]: Mr. Clerk, do we have anybody from the public with their hand up?

1576
02:08:50,426 --> 02:08:55,629
[SPEAKER_22]: Not that I can see, Mr. President.

1577
02:08:55,649 --> 02:08:56,350
[SPEAKER_26]: Let me just check here.

1578

[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_22]: Vice President Caraviello?

1657
02:13:22,949 --> 02:13:23,409
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

1658
02:13:23,429 --> 02:13:23,569

02:13:42,219 --> 02:13:46,821
[SPEAKER_25]: I'd like to make a motion to sever the First Amendment 1 and the Second Amendment 2.

1672
02:13:47,001 --> 02:13:52,723
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, so Amendment 1.

1673
02:13:52,763 --> 02:13:59,965
[SPEAKER_04]: So Amendment 1, Section 48, Dish 51 of the Revised Ordinance of the Amendment for Messages.

1674
02:14:01,451 --> 02:14:03,292
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll read amendment number one, okay?

1675
02:14:04,332 --> 02:14:05,493
[SPEAKER_04]: Just so we're all on the same page here.

1676
02:14:05,513 --> 02:14:12,675
[SPEAKER_04]: Amendment one, section 48-51A of the revised ordinances of the city of Manfred, Massachusetts is hereby amended to read as follows.

1677
02:14:13,235 --> 02:14:27,821
[SPEAKER_04]: Under the authority of MGLA, chapter 40C, section three, the following historic districts founded respectively in which are on file in the city clerk's office are made a part of this article by reference are hereby established.

1678
02:14:28,735 --> 02:14:34,917
[SPEAKER_04]: Hillside Avenue Historic District, number one, and number two, Mom Simmons Historic District.

1679
02:14:36,017 --> 02:14:45,860
[SPEAKER_04]: Amendment two, section 48-51A, the revised ordinances of the city of Medford, Massachusetts, as amended in section one, is hereby further amended to read as follows.

1680
02:14:46,480 --> 02:14:49,561
[SPEAKER_04]: Under the authority of MGLAC chapter 40C,

1681
02:14:51,241 --> 02:14:59,607
[SPEAKER_04]: Section three, the following historic districts by the respectively in which are on file in the City Clerk's office and made a part of this article by reference are hereby established.

1682
02:15:00,248 --> 02:15:07,993
[SPEAKER_04]: One Hillside Avenue Historic District, two Marm Simmons Historic District, and three, uh, 16 Foster Court Historic District.

1683
02:15:08,874 --> 02:15:11,256
[SPEAKER_04]: So the motion is by Councilor Bears to sever these?

1684
02:15:12,316 --> 02:15:13,297
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes, Mr. President.

1685
02:15:13,317 --> 02:15:13,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1686
02:15:14,138 --> 02:15:15,559
[SPEAKER_04]: Does this motion have a second?

1687
02:15:15,579 --> 02:15:18,261
[SPEAKER_25]: Are we voting on each one of these separately?

1688
02:15:19,805 --> 02:15:22,107
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you looking to vote on each of these separately?

1689
02:15:22,367 --> 02:15:22,607
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes.

1690
02:15:22,928 --> 02:15:29,573
[SPEAKER_27]: Mr. President, can I ask the petitioner, the council that made the motion to explain the reasoning for the reason to sever?

1691
02:15:30,914 --> 02:15:34,016
[SPEAKER_25]: I think the first amendment updates the language in the ordinance.

1692
02:15:34,076 --> 02:15:36,818
[SPEAKER_25]: The second amendment would add a historic district.

1693
02:15:37,659 --> 02:15:43,724
[SPEAKER_25]: Regardless of the vote on the specific historic district, I think it is worth updating the language in the ordinance.

1694
02:15:44,184 --> 02:15:46,426
[SPEAKER_25]: So that's why I would have them be two separate votes.

1695
02:15:48,251 --> 02:15:56,013
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm looking at Chapter 48, Section 51 right now, and it looks to read the same to me under Amendment 1.

1696
02:16:00,054 --> 02:16:02,875
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't have a copy of that in front of me, but I'd be happy to take a look at it.

1697
02:16:05,296 --> 02:16:08,197
[SPEAKER_27]: We want to table the issue so the gentleman can take a look at the legislation, Mr. President?

1698
02:16:08,817 --> 02:16:11,298
[SPEAKER_27]: The current zoning ordinance?

1699
02:16:11,438 --> 02:16:13,218
[SPEAKER_04]: Do I take a brief recess to read this over?

1700
02:16:13,758 --> 02:16:14,479
[SPEAKER_27]: Is that necessary?

1701
02:16:14,539 --> 02:16:15,259
[SPEAKER_27]: I mean, you made the motion.

1702
02:16:16,563 --> 02:16:18,004
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm comfortable with the motion as is.

1703
02:16:19,766 --> 02:16:20,406
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1704
02:16:20,426 --> 02:16:21,447
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a motion on the floor.

1705
02:16:21,487 --> 02:16:25,990
[SPEAKER_04]: That motion is to sever, uh, uh, the amendment one and amendment two.

1706
02:16:26,110 --> 02:16:30,994
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is because, um, this was to correct console bears.

1707
02:16:31,214 --> 02:16:32,295
[SPEAKER_04]: This is to clarify.

1708
02:16:32,655 --> 02:16:38,319
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, it's, I don't want to speak to the intent of the mayor and proposing this, but there's two separate amendments dealing with two separate issues.

1709
02:16:38,359 --> 02:16:39,780
[SPEAKER_25]: And I think we should vote on them separately.

1710
02:16:39,801 --> 02:16:45,685
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Marks.

1711
02:16:47,083 --> 02:16:58,633
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm not mistaken, the first amendment shows the exact ordinance that states the two different historic districts, Hillside Ave and Myram Simmons Historic District.

1712
02:16:59,093 --> 02:17:04,698
[SPEAKER_02]: And the amendment two, which we would be voting on, is the addition of foster court.

1713
02:17:05,378 --> 02:17:07,400
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not quite sure why you would sever it.

1714
02:17:08,020 --> 02:17:09,922
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it matters, to be quite honest with you.

1715
02:17:12,495 --> 02:17:14,236
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it has any bearing on the discussion.

1716
02:17:14,756 --> 02:17:37,122
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd rather, Mr. President, hear about the meeting that was held last night and find out the great news about moving forward on the proposal that we put forward, Mr. President, with the owner of the property and the historical district commission regarding an agreement, Mr. President.

1717
02:17:37,942 --> 02:17:38,582
[SPEAKER_25]: Mr. President.

1718
02:17:40,383 --> 02:17:49,412
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm looking at the ordinance now the 4851 a Amendment one would alter the structure To make it clear.

1719
02:17:49,432 --> 02:17:52,154
[SPEAKER_25]: I think to the reader what?

1720
02:17:52,174 --> 02:17:56,738
[SPEAKER_25]: 4851 a is saying so that's why I would stand by my motion to sever.

1721
02:17:56,939 --> 02:18:00,442
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you So there's a motion on the floor to sever

1722
02:18:01,158 --> 02:18:08,705
[SPEAKER_27]: It looks to me, Mr. President, like actually- It looks to me like it actually takes away the mapping requirements as outlined in the establishment of the district under 4851A.

1723
02:18:09,165 --> 02:18:25,980
[SPEAKER_27]: This is only an amendment to- Bounded as respectively shown on the map entitled versus under the authority of 40C, the following districts bounded respectively in which are on file in the city clerk's office.

1724
02:18:27,512 --> 02:18:30,075
[SPEAKER_27]: and made part of this article reference to hereby established.

1725
02:18:30,095 --> 02:18:31,516
[SPEAKER_27]: It takes away the mapped district.

1726
02:18:35,940 --> 02:18:37,782
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't think it necessarily does that.

1727
02:18:37,802 --> 02:18:40,544
[SPEAKER_27]: It takes out the word map entitled.

1728
02:18:41,145 --> 02:18:42,767
[SPEAKER_27]: I'd be happy to re-insert them.

1729
02:18:43,767 --> 02:18:47,131
[SPEAKER_27]: So you want to re-insert the same language that's in the existing ordinance to separate?

1730
02:18:48,132 --> 02:18:48,892
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't have a problem with that.

1731
02:18:50,354 --> 02:18:51,395
[SPEAKER_27]: So we're going to strike

1732
02:18:52,338 --> 02:18:57,361
[SPEAKER_27]: Amendment 1 and replace it with the existing language in 48-51a.

1733
02:18:57,541 --> 02:18:58,141
[SPEAKER_27]: Is that the motion?

1734
02:18:58,941 --> 02:19:05,505
[SPEAKER_25]: No, I think we're going to change bounded respectively to bounded as respectively shown on the map entitled or the map.

1735
02:19:05,825 --> 02:19:06,085
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah.

1736
02:19:06,966 --> 02:19:10,708
[SPEAKER_27]: And the map entitled the hillside historic Avenue district and the mom Simmons historic district.

1737
02:19:11,128 --> 02:19:14,990
[SPEAKER_25]: Let's say the map reflecting the titles of the historic districts listed below.

1738
02:19:23,952 --> 02:19:30,114
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure if the clerk is following this, but I want to make sure that we have this correct.

1739
02:19:30,434 --> 02:19:33,095
[SPEAKER_25]: Sure, it seems like there's a slight discrepancy in the length.

1740
02:19:33,235 --> 02:19:46,639
[SPEAKER_25]: Basically, amendment one adjusts the paragraph formatting of section 4851 subsection A to better reflect the number of historic districts and show it in a clear list.

1741
02:19:47,339 --> 02:19:56,765
[SPEAKER_25]: It seems that the language bounded as respectively shown on the map is not translated over to this amendment.

1742
02:19:56,925 --> 02:20:09,492
[SPEAKER_25]: So I would instead amend the language to say, instead of bounded respectively, to say bounded as respectively shown on the maps for the districts listed below.

1743
02:20:09,512 --> 02:20:13,615
[SPEAKER_02]: For point of information, Mr. President.

1744
02:20:14,668 --> 02:20:16,390
[SPEAKER_04]: One second, Councilor Marks.

1745
02:20:16,470 --> 02:20:16,910
[SPEAKER_04]: One minute, please.

1746
02:20:17,290 --> 02:20:18,771
[SPEAKER_04]: Clerk Hervey, do you have the language on that?

1747
02:20:20,052 --> 02:20:21,514
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm still working on that, Mr. President.

1748
02:20:21,854 --> 02:20:33,023
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm having trouble following the debate right now in terms of what Councilor Bears wants as an amendment, or wants as a change.

1749
02:20:33,343 --> 02:20:36,986
[SPEAKER_25]: I believe Councilor Knight is the one who had an issue with the language.

1750
02:20:37,717 --> 02:20:38,818
[SPEAKER_27]: It's because I didn't understand it.

1751
02:20:38,838 --> 02:20:41,061
[SPEAKER_27]: I didn't understand why we needed the motion to sever the two.

1752
02:20:42,122 --> 02:20:43,704
[SPEAKER_27]: However, Mr. President, I'll rest my case.

1753
02:20:43,724 --> 02:20:44,285
[SPEAKER_27]: I'll just vote no.

1754
02:20:45,066 --> 02:20:51,313
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, so Mr. Rodriguez is available to speak on this as well, Mr. President.

1755
02:20:51,494 --> 02:20:53,256
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't think he's the city solicitor, Mr. President.

1756
02:20:54,127 --> 02:20:55,328
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, if I could.

1757
02:20:55,688 --> 02:20:59,150
[SPEAKER_04]: We have Council Marks, first time we have Council Morales, so Council Marks.

1758
02:21:00,030 --> 02:21:10,175
[SPEAKER_02]: Just past practice, Mr. President, any paper that has been submitted by any mayor previously, we never had the authority to amend or change, Mr. President.

1759
02:21:10,375 --> 02:21:13,097
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not sure why this would be any different.

1760
02:21:14,217 --> 02:21:18,979
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't think we have the authority to change a paper submitted from the administration.

1761
02:21:19,419 --> 02:21:23,060
[SPEAKER_04]: And I believe you are correct, because that came up actually.

1762
02:21:23,381 --> 02:21:31,423
[SPEAKER_02]: On countless issues, whether it's monetary or not, Mr. President, we've never had the ability to change the mayor's papers.

1763
02:21:31,503 --> 02:21:33,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so that is correct.

1764
02:21:33,784 --> 02:21:34,945
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have consular morale.

1765
02:21:35,805 --> 02:21:36,386
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Morell.

1766
02:21:36,946 --> 02:21:37,607
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1767
02:21:37,667 --> 02:21:39,269
[SPEAKER_28]: I know, I think the clerk just referenced it.

1768
02:21:39,289 --> 02:21:43,994
[SPEAKER_28]: If just someone from the administration could just speak to the, just out of clarity, just the intent of Amendment 1.

1769
02:21:44,154 --> 02:21:55,286
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so you have, Dave, do you want to speak to Councilor Morell's question, the intent of, I'm trying to unmute you.

1770
02:21:55,526 --> 02:21:56,087
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

1771
02:21:57,677 --> 02:21:58,117
[SPEAKER_20]: Sure thing.

1772
02:21:58,197 --> 02:22:02,640
[SPEAKER_20]: I apologize, but the energy efficiency in my office just shut the lights out.

1773
02:22:03,081 --> 02:22:04,141
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't usually sit in the dark.

1774
02:22:05,382 --> 02:22:07,824
[SPEAKER_20]: The point of Amendment 1 was just a technical correction.

1775
02:22:07,864 --> 02:22:18,371
[SPEAKER_20]: It was meant to reflect the actual writing of the ordinance as it currently exists, with the presumption that additional historic districts could be created in the future, and that it would be easy to add them.

1776
02:22:18,471 --> 02:22:20,172
[SPEAKER_20]: That was the sole purpose of Amendment 1.

1777
02:22:20,312 --> 02:22:27,197
[SPEAKER_20]: Amendment 2 just clarifies that it added the 16 foster core at the request of the mayor and at the request of the historical

1778
02:22:27,857 --> 02:22:32,281
[SPEAKER_20]: It was written here in the mayor's office, it was prepared by the city solicitor's office.

1779
02:22:33,822 --> 02:22:35,804
[SPEAKER_20]: She could speak to that if she so chooses.

1780
02:22:35,824 --> 02:22:42,469
[SPEAKER_20]: And if there's a language discrepancy, we're happy to address that.

1781
02:22:42,489 --> 02:22:43,010
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, thank you.

1782
02:22:43,030 --> 02:22:44,171
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Morales.

1783
02:22:44,191 --> 02:22:45,372
[SPEAKER_04]: Your amendment?

1784
02:22:46,132 --> 02:22:47,173
[SPEAKER_25]: I've withdrawn the motion.

1785
02:22:47,313 --> 02:22:50,216
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, Councilor Bears has withdrawn his motion.

1786
02:22:51,857 --> 02:22:53,899
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, let's see.

1787
02:22:53,959 --> 02:22:56,181
[SPEAKER_04]: Did anyone have any questions regarding this?

1788
02:22:58,641 --> 02:23:03,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, do we have any of the property owner or the- We do, we do.

1789
02:23:03,745 --> 02:23:05,746
[SPEAKER_02]: Members of the Historical District Commission on it?

1790
02:23:05,766 --> 02:23:06,507
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a number of people.

1791
02:23:06,527 --> 02:23:09,308
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have Ari Goldschneider here, we have Christopher Bader here.

1792
02:23:09,328 --> 02:23:11,490
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to hear from anyone in particular?

1793
02:23:11,530 --> 02:23:12,371
[SPEAKER_04]: First, Councilor Marks?

1794
02:23:12,891 --> 02:23:14,472
[SPEAKER_02]: Whichever way you choose, Mr. President.

1795
02:23:14,492 --> 02:23:18,715
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, let's hear from Ari Goldschneider.

1796
02:23:18,755 --> 02:23:20,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Name and address for the record, please.

1797
02:23:20,076 --> 02:23:22,378
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1798
02:23:22,618 --> 02:23:26,961
[SPEAKER_15]: Ari Goldschneider, 1287 Bay Road, Sharon, Massachusetts.

1799
02:23:27,834 --> 02:23:43,185
[SPEAKER_15]: I just like to recap the Committee of the Whole discussion that we had at the property and then talk about the process that we went through to incorporate their feedback.

1800
02:23:43,745 --> 02:23:54,013
[SPEAKER_15]: As many of the people here know, there was a Committee of the Whole to walk through 16 Foster Court roughly two weeks ago.

1801
02:23:55,795 --> 02:24:10,942
[SPEAKER_15]: During that walk through the building, it was quite clear to the city council members, and they can speak about how they felt themselves, it was quite clear that the existing structure could not be reused.

1802
02:24:11,963 --> 02:24:22,267
[SPEAKER_15]: And we pivoted to try to find a middle ground with the historic commission and the historic district commission

1803
02:24:24,850 --> 02:24:45,145
[SPEAKER_15]: at their request to incorporate certain front-facing architectural features, namely the four windows and the front door, as well as the ridgeline of the existing structure, or replica, if you will, because the existing structure cannot be reused, into the new building.

1804
02:24:45,245 --> 02:24:53,551
[SPEAKER_15]: So that was the arrangement, the agreement in principle that we had at that committee of the whole roughly two weeks ago.

1805
02:24:54,190 --> 02:24:58,771
[SPEAKER_15]: It was a compromise brokered by Council Marks.

1806
02:25:00,271 --> 02:25:19,256
[SPEAKER_15]: And with that feedback, I enlisted my architect, Adam Glassman, who's here, to come up with plans that incorporate what we had discussed, the four windows, the front door, and the ridge line into the proposed structure.

1807
02:25:20,612 --> 02:25:22,232
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what we did, based on the feedback.

1808
02:25:23,292 --> 02:25:35,475
[SPEAKER_15]: We shared those plans with the historic commission and historic district commission, as well as Mr. Herdbeast to send along to the city council members on Friday, this past Friday.

1809
02:25:36,955 --> 02:25:47,917
[SPEAKER_15]: There was a historic district commission meeting yesterday, Monday, at which point they basically rejected the drawings.

1810
02:25:50,089 --> 02:26:05,166
[SPEAKER_15]: like how the building looked and they sought to move forward with the local historic district so that they'd have design review over the new building, which... Mr. Goldschneider, one minute, please.

1811
02:26:05,346 --> 02:26:07,348
[SPEAKER_27]: Can I just ask them to repeat that?

1812
02:26:07,368 --> 02:26:07,769
[SPEAKER_27]: They want what?

1813
02:26:07,829 --> 02:26:08,630
[SPEAKER_27]: Over the building?

1814
02:26:12,071 --> 02:26:12,791
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's why.

1815
02:26:42,708 --> 02:26:43,028
[SPEAKER_15]: here.

1816
02:26:43,468 --> 02:26:43,668
[SPEAKER_15]: here.

1817
02:27:07,631 --> 02:27:13,855
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I'll open it up to questions, or Adam, if you want to walk through how we came up with the design, maybe that would be helpful.

1818
02:27:14,375 --> 02:27:15,096
[SPEAKER_25]: Mr. President.

1819
02:27:15,836 --> 02:27:16,537
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Bears.

1820
02:27:16,737 --> 02:27:18,398
[SPEAKER_25]: Could we hear from Mr. Bader?

1821
02:27:19,018 --> 02:27:24,262
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, okay, so Mr. Goldstein, if we may, let's hear from Mr. Bader, okay, from the Historical Commission.

1822
02:27:31,755 --> 02:27:33,436
[SPEAKER_04]: Chris Bader, name and address of the record, please.

1823
02:27:33,917 --> 02:27:35,218
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, this is Chris Bader.

1824
02:27:35,238 --> 02:27:41,823
[SPEAKER_14]: I am the chair of the Historic District Commission and I live at 298 High Street, Inman.

1825
02:27:45,886 --> 02:27:53,973
[SPEAKER_14]: So my understanding is that Mr. Goldschlatter agreed to compromise.

1826
02:27:54,513 --> 02:27:56,334
[SPEAKER_14]: He sent us a design for the compromise.

1827
02:27:57,255 --> 02:27:58,176
[SPEAKER_14]: No one on the commission

1828
02:27:58,863 --> 02:28:03,864
[SPEAKER_14]: And no architect that we consulted found a compromise satisfactory.

1829
02:28:04,184 --> 02:28:08,885
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just, I think disappointing is the word we came up with.

1830
02:28:09,385 --> 02:28:12,966
[SPEAKER_14]: And we would like to continue the negotiations in good faith.

1831
02:28:14,887 --> 02:28:20,868
[SPEAKER_14]: We are actually willing to go into negotiations with no preconditions whatsoever.

1832
02:28:21,368 --> 02:28:25,989
[SPEAKER_14]: But we can't really negotiate unless the local historic kitchen is created.

1833
02:28:26,598 --> 02:28:28,761
[SPEAKER_02]: Point of information, Mr. President, just if I could.

1834
02:28:28,821 --> 02:28:29,782
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Mr. Bader, one minute.

1835
02:28:29,943 --> 02:28:32,105
[SPEAKER_02]: Point of information, Councilor Larkins.

1836
02:28:32,206 --> 02:28:41,558
[SPEAKER_02]: Not to interrupt, Mr. President, but I really want to understand this because the way I understood it was we were looking at saving the facade of the structure.

1837
02:28:42,339 --> 02:28:46,643
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was some discussion whether or not it was going to be to the roof line or not.

1838
02:28:47,503 --> 02:28:55,110
[SPEAKER_02]: And the renderings that I saw gave two different versions, one to the roof ridge and the other one just below the roof ridge.

1839
02:28:55,870 --> 02:29:06,099
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm kind of not sure what Mr. Bader is talking about, unless he can give me some more information about why it wasn't acceptable.

1840
02:29:06,159 --> 02:29:08,541
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we were all there at the meeting.

1841
02:29:09,421 --> 02:29:14,303
[SPEAKER_02]: And we thought we were moving forward on an issue.

1842
02:29:14,923 --> 02:29:20,865
[SPEAKER_02]: And now to hear that it's not acceptable is a little troubling, Mr. President.

1843
02:29:20,965 --> 02:29:29,468
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think that we understood exactly what was going to be proposed.

1844
02:29:29,648 --> 02:29:31,929
[SPEAKER_14]: And when we did see it, we were very disappointed.

1845
02:29:33,129 --> 02:29:37,651
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not an architect myself, but we have four architects together.

1846
02:29:43,980 --> 02:30:03,657
[SPEAKER_02]: So Mr. President, based on the discussions that we had, the initial discussions, I was wondering if Mr. Bader can get into more detail from what we spoke about originally as an agreement to what the disapproval is now.

1847
02:30:04,377 --> 02:30:09,922
[SPEAKER_02]: And I understand he's saying it's based on architects and other people, but

1848
02:30:12,028 --> 02:30:16,251
[SPEAKER_02]: Did the petitioner not present in those renderings?

1849
02:30:17,191 --> 02:30:18,112
[SPEAKER_02]: If I could just finish.

1850
02:30:18,672 --> 02:30:20,033
[SPEAKER_02]: If I could just finish.

1851
02:30:20,053 --> 02:30:22,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Bader, Mr. Bader, one minute, Councilor Locke has the floor.

1852
02:30:22,815 --> 02:30:24,536
[SPEAKER_02]: If I could just finish, Mr. Bader.

1853
02:30:24,576 --> 02:30:25,457
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's all right, thank you.

1854
02:30:26,397 --> 02:30:37,004
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to understand this because we put a lot of time and effort into coming to what I thought was an agreement to save a piece of historical property and also, Mr. President, move forward.

1855
02:30:37,544 --> 02:30:46,008
[SPEAKER_02]: on creating what I would consider additional housing in the area, which was a win-win situation.

1856
02:30:46,448 --> 02:30:52,231
[SPEAKER_02]: So I am extremely disappointed to hear if that doesn't come to fruition tonight, Mr. President.

1857
02:30:52,251 --> 02:31:01,815
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would like to hear more about why the two renderings that were presented, which to me address the exact issue that we were talking about.

1858
02:31:02,275 --> 02:31:05,557
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember Mr. Hayward at the meeting, I asked him point blank,

1859
02:31:06,037 --> 02:31:09,740
[SPEAKER_02]: about the windows on either side of the roof line.

1860
02:31:10,060 --> 02:31:26,393
[SPEAKER_02]: I asked him about the chimney, and at the point, he said they didn't have, and I won't speak for him, but there was no real historical significance, and he didn't even see a reason to save the chimney and the two windows on either side.

1861
02:31:26,473 --> 02:31:31,017
[SPEAKER_02]: So I really would like to know a little more why this is not acceptable, Mr. President.

1862
02:31:32,008 --> 02:31:32,788
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Counsel Mox.

1863
02:31:32,848 --> 02:31:34,349
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Bader, please continue.

1864
02:31:34,749 --> 02:31:37,670
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, I think, is Ryan available?

1865
02:31:37,690 --> 02:31:39,271
[SPEAKER_04]: Ryan Hayward?

1866
02:31:39,711 --> 02:31:41,111
[SPEAKER_04]: Ryan, I'm going to unmute you.

1867
02:31:41,191 --> 02:31:41,911
[SPEAKER_04]: Ryan Hayward?

1868
02:31:44,412 --> 02:31:49,454
[SPEAKER_14]: I think Ryan can address the question better than I can.

1869
02:31:49,474 --> 02:31:51,175
[SPEAKER_04]: Point of information, Councilor Knight.

1870
02:31:51,615 --> 02:31:57,397
[SPEAKER_27]: Is it the role of the Historic Commission or the Historic District Commission to establish historic districts?

1871
02:31:58,723 --> 02:31:59,884
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the historic district commission.

1872
02:32:00,304 --> 02:32:02,966
[SPEAKER_27]: So why would Mr. Haywood be the expert on these questions?

1873
02:32:02,986 --> 02:32:08,009
[SPEAKER_14]: Because he was the one who was present when the tentative proposal was discussed.

1874
02:32:08,029 --> 02:32:09,070
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, I was there.

1875
02:32:09,150 --> 02:32:10,271
[SPEAKER_14]: I recall that.

1876
02:32:20,094 --> 02:32:22,895
[SPEAKER_14]: We take his recommendations very seriously.

1877
02:32:23,035 --> 02:32:30,498
[SPEAKER_14]: Or I can have, we actually have another architect who actually is on the district commission, Fred Sewell.

1878
02:32:30,918 --> 02:32:32,319
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe he can address these questions.

1879
02:32:33,479 --> 02:32:36,921
[SPEAKER_04]: And if I may, if someone could please mute the background music.

1880
02:32:38,283 --> 02:32:41,225
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I'm sorry, that's me.

1881
02:32:42,186 --> 02:32:45,709
[SPEAKER_04]: The audio is tough on this end, so every little bit helps.

1882
02:32:45,889 --> 02:32:50,092
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to unmute Ryan, I'm having a tough time.

1883
02:32:52,293 --> 02:32:58,358
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, if you want to point to somebody on the district commission itself, Fred, I believe, is available.

1884
02:32:59,859 --> 02:33:01,760
[SPEAKER_14]: Fred Rick Soul, HTC.

1885
02:33:02,140 --> 02:33:05,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, Fred, I'm trying to unmute you as well.

1886
02:33:09,284 --> 02:33:10,805
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, Fred, you've been unmuted.

1887
02:33:10,825 --> 02:33:11,045
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1888
02:33:11,605 --> 02:33:12,466
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1889
02:33:12,526 --> 02:33:18,609
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes, I'm Frederick Soll from the Historic District Commission, 35 7th Street here in Medford.

1890
02:33:19,450 --> 02:33:22,351
[SPEAKER_29]: And thank you for your attention tonight.

1891
02:33:22,391 --> 02:33:28,575
[SPEAKER_29]: We did meet last night with Harry and his team, and we did discuss this in some detail.

1892
02:33:29,515 --> 02:33:35,259
[SPEAKER_29]: He presented drawings with an option A and an option B for this thing.

1893
02:33:35,279 --> 02:33:38,801
[SPEAKER_29]: And all the members of the commission were sort of disappointed, as Chris has noted.

1894
02:33:40,261 --> 02:33:44,844
[SPEAKER_29]: I wasn't available, and I wasn't involved in the site walkthrough with the council.

1895
02:33:44,984 --> 02:33:46,445
[SPEAKER_29]: I apologize for that.

1896
02:33:46,485 --> 02:33:50,447
[SPEAKER_29]: I really didn't understand that there was horse training going to happen at that meeting.

1897
02:33:51,268 --> 02:33:54,870
[SPEAKER_29]: And I guess if you made some unwritten

1898
02:33:57,711 --> 02:34:03,274
[SPEAKER_29]: promises or, you know, sort of unwritten expectations for a compromise on that.

1899
02:34:03,374 --> 02:34:04,555
[SPEAKER_29]: We weren't aware of that.

1900
02:34:04,615 --> 02:34:08,257
[SPEAKER_29]: None of us in the Historic District Commission were privy to that conversation.

1901
02:34:08,998 --> 02:34:16,882
[SPEAKER_29]: So I went to, at Mr. Goldschneider's request, went there this morning, and he was very generous and gave us the combination to the lockbox.

1902
02:34:16,942 --> 02:34:19,964
[SPEAKER_29]: Ryan Hayward and I visited this morning and walked through the property.

1903
02:34:19,984 --> 02:34:24,807
[SPEAKER_29]: And part of what we're discussing is whether it's

1904
02:34:25,612 --> 02:34:43,264
[SPEAKER_29]: total demolition or whether it's a rebuild, and I believe Adam and Harry and the team feel that the building can't be saved and that the drawing before us, the rendering they showed us last night, was sort of a reproduction of this property up to the ridgeline.

1905
02:34:44,204 --> 02:34:52,870
[SPEAKER_29]: And they really were insistent that we approve that the building had no value and couldn't be salvaged and should be demolished.

1906
02:34:53,601 --> 02:34:59,487
[SPEAKER_29]: And based on my walkthrough today, I'm unwilling to commit to that, that the building is beyond salvage.

1907
02:34:59,507 --> 02:35:00,648
[SPEAKER_29]: Point of information, Mr. President?

1908
02:35:01,949 --> 02:35:03,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Point of information, Councilor Knight.

1909
02:35:03,491 --> 02:35:04,892
[SPEAKER_27]: Is the gentleman a structural engineer?

1910
02:35:06,774 --> 02:35:08,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Sewell, are you a structural engineer?

1911
02:35:09,197 --> 02:35:10,258
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm not a structural engineer.

1912
02:35:10,278 --> 02:35:11,959
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm a registered architect in Massachusetts.

1913
02:35:12,240 --> 02:35:14,442
[SPEAKER_29]: And I'm a preservation architect as well.

1914
02:35:14,842 --> 02:35:16,604
[SPEAKER_27]: And the architects have the...

1915
02:35:17,830 --> 02:35:25,532
[SPEAKER_27]: professional knowledge and expertise to determine whether or not a structure is salvageable based on the building code and the like?

1916
02:35:26,232 --> 02:35:27,413
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes, we do have that authority.

1917
02:35:27,673 --> 02:35:35,115
[SPEAKER_29]: I mean, you generally consult with a structural engineer, and if we wanted to, we could do it with an independent structural engineer.

1918
02:35:35,195 --> 02:35:42,217
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm not actually believing an engineer hired by the developer here, myself, but that could be fine.

1919
02:35:42,864 --> 02:35:44,525
[SPEAKER_29]: The building needs a tremendous amount of work.

1920
02:35:44,625 --> 02:35:51,808
[SPEAKER_29]: I agree with that, and as Chris has noted, we at the Historic District have the authority to authorize a demolition of this building.

1921
02:35:51,948 --> 02:35:52,628
[SPEAKER_29]: We can do that.

1922
02:35:52,769 --> 02:35:54,009
[SPEAKER_29]: That's within our parameters.

1923
02:35:54,029 --> 02:36:01,953
[SPEAKER_29]: We're not saying it has to be saved, but I'm not, Mr. Goldstein had asked us to point blank say the building could not be salvaged.

1924
02:36:01,993 --> 02:36:04,074
[SPEAKER_29]: We were unwilling to do that, all members of the commission.

1925
02:36:04,814 --> 02:36:10,797
[SPEAKER_29]: But that doesn't mean we aren't willing to, as Chris has noted, willing to consider that in our negotiations

1926
02:36:11,789 --> 02:36:12,769
[SPEAKER_29]: what's the next steps.

1927
02:36:13,409 --> 02:36:20,371
[SPEAKER_29]: The renderings that were shown just took the building that had previously been designed and put this sort of appendage on the front of it.

1928
02:36:20,931 --> 02:36:29,354
[SPEAKER_29]: And we all found it, from a preservation standpoint, not very persuasive and sort of not a very good design, I guess.

1929
02:36:29,474 --> 02:36:31,494
[SPEAKER_29]: And we are a design review board.

1930
02:36:31,514 --> 02:36:33,895
[SPEAKER_29]: That's our authority as a historic district commission.

1931
02:36:33,915 --> 02:36:36,056
[SPEAKER_29]: The historical commission is not a design review board.

1932
02:36:36,076 --> 02:36:37,616
[SPEAKER_29]: The historic district commission is.

1933
02:36:38,216 --> 02:36:41,077
[SPEAKER_29]: Our job is to look at what people are proposing in our districts

1934
02:36:41,673 --> 02:36:43,735
[SPEAKER_29]: and approve them, or modify them, or whatever.

1935
02:36:43,755 --> 02:36:47,959
[SPEAKER_29]: And we're open to all these suggestions of what people have done.

1936
02:36:48,099 --> 02:36:56,506
[SPEAKER_29]: And we have worked with developers in a particular building in Hillside Avenue, historic district, that's been converted to condos and things.

1937
02:36:57,407 --> 02:36:59,809
[SPEAKER_29]: And none of us are always happy with the outcome.

1938
02:36:59,849 --> 02:37:02,992
[SPEAKER_29]: We all have a robust discussion about it.

1939
02:37:03,012 --> 02:37:03,772
[SPEAKER_29]: We take our votes.

1940
02:37:04,253 --> 02:37:06,495
[SPEAKER_29]: Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose, sort of thing.

1941
02:37:08,376 --> 02:37:12,118
[SPEAKER_29]: We would have no authority over this property if it's not a historic district commission.

1942
02:37:12,158 --> 02:37:14,979
[SPEAKER_29]: I know Mr. Goldschneider has said they'll negotiate in good faith.

1943
02:37:15,019 --> 02:37:16,480
[SPEAKER_29]: We're willing to negotiate in good faith.

1944
02:37:16,960 --> 02:37:26,625
[SPEAKER_29]: But the only authority we have as your representative here in the city to protect buildings in the historic district is if they're in a local historic district.

1945
02:37:26,685 --> 02:37:35,989
[SPEAKER_29]: Then the building department cannot issue a building permit for exterior changes without our saying that accepted changes are

1946
02:37:37,589 --> 02:37:45,192
[SPEAKER_29]: are okay with us, and that's what we do every day, day, month in, month out, whether the commission and the council knows we do this work or do.

1947
02:37:46,152 --> 02:37:48,593
[SPEAKER_29]: And I went there today, and Ryan went there today.

1948
02:37:48,633 --> 02:37:51,154
[SPEAKER_29]: We thought there were other alternatives, good alternatives.

1949
02:37:51,314 --> 02:37:53,895
[SPEAKER_29]: Maybe it gets demolished, maybe it doesn't get demolished.

1950
02:37:54,575 --> 02:38:01,397
[SPEAKER_29]: None of us are opposed to a large three-story apartment building in behind there.

1951
02:38:01,977 --> 02:38:05,639
[SPEAKER_29]: We talked with Mr. Gulschneider and his architect, Adam, about a modern design,

1952
02:38:07,401 --> 02:38:10,202
[SPEAKER_29]: you know, something that's completely different from historic district.

1953
02:38:10,263 --> 02:38:12,564
[SPEAKER_29]: None of us are wedded to the design.

1954
02:38:12,584 --> 02:38:14,845
[SPEAKER_29]: They asked for examples of similar projects.

1955
02:38:14,885 --> 02:38:16,346
[SPEAKER_29]: We gave them a couple of examples.

1956
02:38:17,426 --> 02:38:23,690
[SPEAKER_29]: And, you know, we just thought the design that was presented was very, they only had 10 days to put it together.

1957
02:38:23,730 --> 02:38:27,432
[SPEAKER_29]: We acknowledged that and it just, it could be a lot better.

1958
02:38:27,892 --> 02:38:35,676
[SPEAKER_29]: But we, because of our time constraints, voted last night as a commission, four votes to zero.

1959
02:38:36,260 --> 02:38:42,742
[SPEAKER_29]: to go ahead and ask the city council and the mayor to approve this as a local historic district.

1960
02:38:42,802 --> 02:38:43,682
[SPEAKER_29]: And that's where we are right now.

1961
02:38:44,142 --> 02:38:47,883
[SPEAKER_27]: So, Mr. President, so- Counts on eight.

1962
02:38:47,903 --> 02:38:53,705
[SPEAKER_27]: Mr. Haywood was present at the walkthrough as the chairman of the Medford Historic Commission.

1963
02:38:54,605 --> 02:39:01,307
[SPEAKER_27]: The issue that was before us was whether or not October or something was going to come and go and a demolition permit was going to be issued.

1964
02:39:02,844 --> 02:39:12,708
[SPEAKER_27]: From what I understand, based upon the history that we've all discussed ad nauseum at this point concerning this project, was that he applied for a demolition permit.

1965
02:39:15,029 --> 02:39:18,850
[SPEAKER_27]: He got his property deemed preferentially preserved.

1966
02:39:20,130 --> 02:39:23,732
[SPEAKER_27]: He had his engineer come and say the place can't be salvaged.

1967
02:39:25,693 --> 02:39:31,695
[SPEAKER_27]: Where in the process does this design review come into play for the historic commission?

1968
02:39:32,671 --> 02:39:39,176
[SPEAKER_27]: And if the gentleman said, hey, look it, my engineers say the place can't be salvaged.

1969
02:39:39,436 --> 02:39:44,399
[SPEAKER_27]: Why did the historic commission wait 17 months to send this to historic district commission?

1970
02:39:45,760 --> 02:39:56,287
[SPEAKER_27]: And then Mr. Haywood from the historic commission is the one that made a representation that I believe if we look at the committee report that this shouldn't be deemed a historic district and

1971
02:40:00,176 --> 02:40:03,460
[SPEAKER_27]: the compromise would be satisfactory and that would be the direction that they would move it.

1972
02:40:05,522 --> 02:40:09,966
[SPEAKER_27]: Now, last night, they go before the historic district commission to have the plans looked at.

1973
02:40:11,168 --> 02:40:13,210
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm totally confused by this process, Mr. President.

1974
02:40:13,230 --> 02:40:14,051
[SPEAKER_27]: It's an absolute mess.

1975
02:40:14,691 --> 02:40:16,694
[SPEAKER_27]: It's an absolute mess, in my opinion.

1976
02:40:17,995 --> 02:40:19,737
[SPEAKER_27]: So I'm a little confused as to

1977
02:40:22,591 --> 02:40:26,874
[SPEAKER_27]: The historic district commission doesn't have any design review authority until it becomes a historic district.

1978
02:40:27,675 --> 02:40:32,558
[SPEAKER_27]: And by statute, the historic commission has no design review authority.

1979
02:40:32,678 --> 02:40:39,142
[SPEAKER_27]: And we discussed that at the committee of the whole and the chairman of the committee, the commission acknowledged that they don't have design review.

1980
02:40:40,003 --> 02:40:45,368
[SPEAKER_27]: They're not enabled, those powers on the ordinance that they're operating under.

1981
02:40:45,748 --> 02:40:47,630
[SPEAKER_27]: So I'm very confused as to how this is working.

1982
02:40:48,451 --> 02:41:04,265
[SPEAKER_27]: It seems to me like it's somewhat being weaponized against the developer or against the builder because he didn't agree that the building could be saved and present plans for them to look at during a 17 month period where there's no real statutory authority for them to have design review.

1983
02:41:09,858 --> 02:41:14,520
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes, I would agree, Mr. Knight, that this is a convoluted process.

1984
02:41:14,820 --> 02:41:19,142
[SPEAKER_29]: We, as a historical district commission, we want to do this better.

1985
02:41:19,182 --> 02:41:24,464
[SPEAKER_29]: We want to make things and incorporate more properties within historic districts of Medford.

1986
02:41:24,504 --> 02:41:25,244
[SPEAKER_29]: That's our purview.

1987
02:41:25,264 --> 02:41:27,265
[SPEAKER_29]: It takes a lot of work to do these things.

1988
02:41:27,365 --> 02:41:33,568
[SPEAKER_29]: We have to follow state guidelines of exactly how historic district commissions and historic districts are established.

1989
02:41:33,648 --> 02:41:34,028
[SPEAKER_29]: It's a very

1990
02:41:36,544 --> 02:41:38,505
[SPEAKER_29]: consuming and convoluted process.

1991
02:41:38,545 --> 02:41:40,766
[SPEAKER_29]: It's very laid out by the state of Massachusetts.

1992
02:41:41,546 --> 02:41:43,327
[SPEAKER_29]: We're trying to follow those guidelines here.

1993
02:41:43,347 --> 02:41:47,088
[SPEAKER_29]: As we pointed out last night, the clock is running.

1994
02:41:47,349 --> 02:41:50,810
[SPEAKER_29]: The demolition delay is set to expire.

1995
02:41:51,690 --> 02:41:55,712
[SPEAKER_29]: We were asked to move on this vote for design force.

1996
02:41:55,892 --> 02:41:59,874
[SPEAKER_29]: We were then in our power to say, no, we don't accept the design.

1997
02:42:00,634 --> 02:42:04,876
[SPEAKER_29]: You may or may not like that decision, but that was a decision we as a board came up with.

1998
02:42:05,743 --> 02:42:07,644
[SPEAKER_29]: And that's where we are.

1999
02:42:07,664 --> 02:42:10,506
[SPEAKER_29]: We're trying to work with Mr. Goldschneider and his team.

2000
02:42:11,106 --> 02:42:13,848
[SPEAKER_29]: But so far, what we're seeing is not happening.

2001
02:42:13,908 --> 02:42:17,811
[SPEAKER_27]: The part that's confusing me is why is it before your board if it's not a historic district commission yet?

2002
02:42:19,091 --> 02:42:20,933
[SPEAKER_27]: Why is it at the Medford Historic District Commission?

2003
02:42:20,973 --> 02:42:24,975
[SPEAKER_27]: Why is he going to a meeting there presenting plans when it's not a historic district commission?

2004
02:42:25,115 --> 02:42:28,917
[SPEAKER_27]: And the negotiations took place between the historic commission, not the historic district commission.

2005
02:42:29,698 --> 02:42:32,780
[SPEAKER_29]: So last night, to answer that question, last night we were

2006
02:42:35,367 --> 02:42:43,472
[SPEAKER_29]: meeting to approve the mayor's revised language and the historic district submittal before you tonight.

2007
02:42:43,492 --> 02:42:48,656
[SPEAKER_29]: So that was our main issue for gathering last night and voting on that, which we passed unanimously.

2008
02:42:49,631 --> 02:43:08,407
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Stewart, Mr. Stewart, Mr. Stewart, Mr. Stewart, Mr. Stewart, Mr. Stewart, Mr. Stewart, Mr. Stewart, Mr. Stewart, Mr. Stewart, Mr. Stewart, Mr. Stewart, Mr. Stewart, Mr. Stewart, Mr. Stewart, Mr. Stewart, Mr. Stewart, Mr. Stewart, Mr. Stewart, Mr. Stewart, Mr. Stewart, Mr. Stewart, Mr. Stewart, Mr. Stewart, Mr. Stewart, Mr. Stewart, Mr. Stewart, Mr. Stewart, Mr. Stewart, Mr. Stewart, Mr. Stewart, Mr. Stewart, Mr. Stewart, Mr. Stewart, Mr. Stewart, Mr. Stewart, Mr. Stewart, Mr. Stewart, Mr. Stewart, Mr. Stewart, Mr. Stewart, Mr. Stewart, Mr. Stewart, Mr. Stewart, Mr. Stewart, Mr. Stewart, Mr. Stewart, Mr. Stewart, Mr. Stewart, Mr. Stewart, Mr. Stewart, Mr. Stewart, Mr. Stewart, Mr. Stewart, Mr. Stewart, Mr. Stewart,

2009
02:43:14,480 --> 02:43:22,885
[SPEAKER_29]: It did come to the council, we approved it, but my understanding is last night there was a slightly revised version that we needed to vote on to move this forward.

2010
02:43:22,945 --> 02:43:25,847
[SPEAKER_29]: There was some slight language adjustments made to it.

2011
02:43:25,907 --> 02:43:28,229
[SPEAKER_27]: Is the administration going to offer that paper to the council?

2012
02:43:28,389 --> 02:43:31,651
[SPEAKER_27]: Because the paper that's before us is the paper that the mayor gave us on September 3rd.

2013
02:43:33,772 --> 02:43:36,574
[SPEAKER_29]: I'd have to look at what the one we voted on last night was.

2014
02:43:36,834 --> 02:43:40,056
[SPEAKER_29]: My understanding was that wasn't going to be the revised one submitted.

2015
02:43:40,529 --> 02:43:45,954
[SPEAKER_27]: Paper 20541 is the paper before us offered by Mayor Lungo-Curran to the Medford City Council September 3rd, 2020.

2016
02:43:49,277 --> 02:43:49,758
[SPEAKER_27]: Correct.

2017
02:43:49,978 --> 02:43:50,458
[SPEAKER_27]: 33 days ago.

2018
02:43:52,220 --> 02:43:52,961
[SPEAKER_29]: I can't speak to that.

2019
02:43:53,001 --> 02:43:55,323
[SPEAKER_29]: I'd have to look through and find out.

2020
02:43:55,743 --> 02:43:57,865
[SPEAKER_29]: Maybe Chris, if you could add to that.

2021
02:43:57,925 --> 02:44:00,948
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't know the answer to that one.

2022
02:44:01,289 --> 02:44:03,651
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm happy to add to that.

2023
02:44:05,342 --> 02:44:13,486
[SPEAKER_14]: Basically, we, the cities, we're talking about the same, we're not talking about different papers.

2024
02:44:14,466 --> 02:44:22,950
[SPEAKER_14]: The paper that was read earlier, about 15 minutes ago, is exactly the same paper that we considered last night.

2025
02:44:23,530 --> 02:44:24,470
[SPEAKER_14]: So there's no issue there.

2026
02:44:26,151 --> 02:44:29,913
[SPEAKER_02]: So why the vote last night then?

2027
02:44:30,033 --> 02:44:34,615
[SPEAKER_14]: Because the city solicitor explicitly requested clarification.

2028
02:44:35,607 --> 02:44:41,009
[SPEAKER_14]: And we, when the city solicitor tells us to do something, we do it.

2029
02:44:44,810 --> 02:44:49,172
[SPEAKER_02]: So was there a previous vote on this back in September to create this historic?

2030
02:44:49,192 --> 02:44:49,392
[SPEAKER_02]: There was.

2031
02:44:49,832 --> 02:44:50,252
[SPEAKER_02]: There was?

2032
02:44:50,272 --> 02:44:50,772
[SPEAKER_02]: There was.

2033
02:44:50,912 --> 02:44:51,812
[SPEAKER_25]: Point of information.

2034
02:44:51,952 --> 02:44:53,513
[SPEAKER_02]: What was the vote at that point?

2035
02:44:54,713 --> 02:44:59,195
[SPEAKER_14]: The vote was three to zero to create the local historic district.

2036
02:45:27,280 --> 02:45:30,521
[SPEAKER_25]: And so that was when this was first voted on the first time.

2037
02:45:30,561 --> 02:45:31,742
[SPEAKER_25]: That's what you're referring to as the 3, 0.

2038
02:45:54,404 --> 02:45:56,166
[SPEAKER_04]: There was another point of information council night.

2039
02:45:56,626 --> 02:45:57,787
[SPEAKER_27]: So I'm confused by this.

2040
02:45:57,827 --> 02:46:11,358
[SPEAKER_27]: So the historic commission sent their paperwork to the historic district commission to establish a single home historic district at 16 Foster court and August 28th.

2041
02:46:13,799 --> 02:46:23,147
[SPEAKER_27]: The historic district commission took a vote at that August 28th meeting that passed three to zero to move forward with the creation of the district.

2042
02:46:25,077 --> 02:46:25,497
[SPEAKER_27]: Correct?

2043
02:46:27,258 --> 02:46:28,158
[SPEAKER_14]: Just a moment.

2044
02:46:28,778 --> 02:46:30,199
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm trying to recall.

2045
02:46:30,339 --> 02:46:35,960
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, the one actually happened in the August meeting.

2046
02:46:36,020 --> 02:46:36,501
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry.

2047
02:46:37,241 --> 02:46:39,822
[SPEAKER_14]: I misspoke.

2048
02:46:40,402 --> 02:46:45,083
[SPEAKER_14]: Because the September meeting was devoted to other business that we had to pass over.

2049
02:46:45,643 --> 02:46:47,044
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry for my lapse in memory there.

2050
02:46:47,464 --> 02:46:47,704
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

2051
02:46:47,724 --> 02:46:50,305
[SPEAKER_14]: The vote was taken in August.

2052
02:46:52,235 --> 02:46:55,837
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, so then the mayor sends to us this language on September 3rd?

2053
02:46:56,938 --> 02:46:57,198
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes.

2054
02:46:58,259 --> 02:47:00,301
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know when it was September 3rd.

2055
02:47:02,142 --> 02:47:04,624
[SPEAKER_27]: You guys only passed it August 28th, that's pretty good if you ask me.

2056
02:47:05,925 --> 02:47:08,507
[SPEAKER_27]: You guys passed it August 28th, the mayor sent it to us September 3rd.

2057
02:47:08,527 --> 02:47:10,829
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't think that's too bad, five days.

2058
02:47:14,818 --> 02:47:18,481
[SPEAKER_27]: Now, the language that the mayor sent us is the language that you guys never looked at.

2059
02:47:18,541 --> 02:47:19,361
[SPEAKER_27]: Is that what I'm understanding?

2060
02:47:19,982 --> 02:47:22,243
[SPEAKER_27]: So you voted for the principle, but you didn't vote for the language.

2061
02:47:22,283 --> 02:47:27,287
[SPEAKER_14]: When we took the vote, we did not know exactly what language the city solicitor had in mind.

2062
02:47:27,667 --> 02:47:33,572
[SPEAKER_14]: She wanted the clarification that was discussed earlier at this meeting, the city council meeting just now.

2063
02:47:34,452 --> 02:47:37,494
[SPEAKER_14]: And so we voted again on it last night.

2064
02:47:38,415 --> 02:47:39,736
[SPEAKER_14]: So we took the initial vote.

2065
02:47:40,436 --> 02:47:41,477
[SPEAKER_14]: To create the district.

2066
02:47:41,597 --> 02:47:43,559
[SPEAKER_14]: To create a local district.

2067
02:47:47,749 --> 02:47:58,079
[SPEAKER_14]: specifically mentioning that it was including the house and the entire property and the city solicitor requested clarification.

2068
02:47:58,600 --> 02:48:01,523
[SPEAKER_14]: We provided that as a further clarification last night.

2069
02:48:03,505 --> 02:48:04,746
[SPEAKER_27]: As to what it is that you seek?

2070
02:48:04,946 --> 02:48:05,186
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay.

2071
02:48:05,607 --> 02:48:05,747
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

2072
02:48:06,581 --> 02:48:17,409
[SPEAKER_27]: But until this 16 foster court is deemed a local historic single home district, what authority does the Medford Historical District Commission have over it?

2073
02:48:17,589 --> 02:48:29,378
[SPEAKER_14]: We can simply recommend to you to create a local historic district, and then we'll have the power to administer it per section 44.

2074
02:48:37,410 --> 02:48:38,491
[SPEAKER_14]: you make to the bylaws.

2075
02:48:39,172 --> 02:48:42,374
[SPEAKER_14]: For example, the antennas in pink color.

2076
02:48:42,675 --> 02:48:48,760
[SPEAKER_27]: In theory, then, Mr. Goldschneider had no obligation whatsoever to appear before the Historic District Commission.

2077
02:48:48,780 --> 02:48:49,140
[SPEAKER_14]: Not at all.

2078
02:48:49,360 --> 02:48:53,924
[SPEAKER_14]: He did so in good faith, and I appreciate that, and I want to continue our negotiations.

2079
02:48:53,984 --> 02:49:00,089
[SPEAKER_27]: Where he really should have been would be before the Medford Historic Commission, because that's where the rub lies, right?

2080
02:49:00,409 --> 02:49:01,550
[SPEAKER_27]: I mean, that's what it sounds to me.

2081
02:49:01,570 --> 02:49:03,371
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, you know, we are

2082
02:49:08,487 --> 02:49:10,228
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't speak for the Historical Commission.

2083
02:49:10,828 --> 02:49:20,330
[SPEAKER_14]: The Historic District Commission has to deal with the facts on the ground, and we are very, very open to negotiating really anything.

2084
02:49:20,410 --> 02:49:28,171
[SPEAKER_14]: There would have been no preconditions if this had been brought to the Historic District Commission earlier.

2085
02:49:28,892 --> 02:49:35,533
[SPEAKER_27]: So, I mean, absent... So for 17 months, the applicant

2086
02:49:38,371 --> 02:49:42,194
[SPEAKER_27]: sat saying, you know, my engineers say it's a total teardown.

2087
02:49:42,575 --> 02:49:45,577
[SPEAKER_27]: My structural engineer says that, you know, there's nothing I can do.

2088
02:49:45,918 --> 02:49:46,638
[SPEAKER_27]: I have to rip it up.

2089
02:49:46,899 --> 02:49:47,719
[SPEAKER_27]: I have to pull it down.

2090
02:49:48,140 --> 02:49:53,364
[SPEAKER_27]: My structural engineer, my expert, who I hired and has paid the money, told me that this is what's going on.

2091
02:49:53,905 --> 02:49:54,986
[SPEAKER_27]: So he has an expert opinion.

2092
02:49:56,367 --> 02:49:56,547
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

2093
02:49:56,827 --> 02:49:57,108
[SPEAKER_27]: OK.

2094
02:49:57,808 --> 02:50:00,471
[SPEAKER_27]: So at that point in time, when

2095
02:50:01,673 --> 02:50:04,674
[SPEAKER_27]: he notified the historic commission of that.

2096
02:50:05,234 --> 02:50:12,216
[SPEAKER_27]: Don't you think it would have made sense that maybe then you moved it forward to the historic district commission instead of dragging it out for 17 months?

2097
02:50:12,236 --> 02:50:14,536
[SPEAKER_14]: I can certainly see why you would think that.

2098
02:50:15,036 --> 02:50:17,277
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't want to second guess the historic commission.

2099
02:50:17,777 --> 02:50:18,677
[SPEAKER_14]: They do great work.

2100
02:50:19,877 --> 02:50:26,679
[SPEAKER_14]: But certainly that is a reasonable view.

2101
02:50:26,699 --> 02:50:26,919
[SPEAKER_27]: Right.

2102
02:50:26,939 --> 02:50:28,439
[SPEAKER_27]: I mean, I feel like it's being weaponized.

2103
02:50:28,459 --> 02:50:30,360
[SPEAKER_27]: Do what we say or else we're going to cost you a ton of money.

2104
02:50:32,831 --> 02:50:33,931
[SPEAKER_14]: And there are 4 members of

2105
02:50:53,524 --> 02:50:54,124
[SPEAKER_14]: There are five.

2106
02:50:54,284 --> 02:50:54,804
[SPEAKER_14]: Five members.

2107
02:50:55,524 --> 02:50:55,744
[SPEAKER_14]: Ms.

2108
02:50:55,784 --> 02:50:57,105
[SPEAKER_14]: Blum, Ms.

2109
02:50:57,185 --> 02:51:01,186
[SPEAKER_14]: Annette Blum is the most recent member to join.

2110
02:51:01,506 --> 02:51:05,246
[SPEAKER_14]: Her husband is in the hospital, so she couldn't make it to last night's meeting.

2111
02:51:05,286 --> 02:51:06,247
[SPEAKER_27]: Sorry to hear that.

2112
02:51:06,307 --> 02:51:08,907
[SPEAKER_27]: Can you just tell me what the terms of service are for all the members?

2113
02:51:10,847 --> 02:51:11,188
[SPEAKER_14]: Three years.

2114
02:51:11,748 --> 02:51:13,448
[SPEAKER_27]: No, in terms of how long they've served.

2115
02:51:13,508 --> 02:51:13,828
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm you.

2116
02:51:13,888 --> 02:51:16,009
[SPEAKER_27]: I know that your term is three years, but you've probably been on there for 12.

2117
02:51:16,369 --> 02:51:19,029
[SPEAKER_14]: I was reappointed by Mayor and Burke, just a portion of the leftovers.

2118
02:51:19,509 --> 02:51:21,170
[SPEAKER_27]: So how many years have you served on the commission?

2119
02:51:22,030 --> 02:51:23,190
[SPEAKER_14]: Approximately 18.

2120
02:51:23,655 --> 02:51:27,037
[SPEAKER_27]: 18.

2121
02:51:23,675 --> 02:51:27,037
[SPEAKER_27]: All right, how many years has the next most senior member served?

2122
02:51:29,378 --> 02:51:32,260
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't, I frankly don't know.

2123
02:51:32,280 --> 02:51:35,942
[SPEAKER_29]: Dino's been on there longer than Chris, and I've been on the board for 11 years.

2124
02:51:36,162 --> 02:51:36,722
[SPEAKER_27]: You're 11?

2125
02:51:36,802 --> 02:51:43,026
[SPEAKER_29]: Charlotte Spadari has been on the board for, I'm going to say, 10 years at least, maybe nine.

2126
02:51:43,366 --> 02:51:45,707
[SPEAKER_29]: So we're a longstanding board.

2127
02:51:46,128 --> 02:51:48,489
[SPEAKER_29]: Almost all of us have more than a decade on this commission.

2128
02:51:50,114 --> 02:51:58,597
[SPEAKER_27]: because that raises some concern, too, when the representative from the historic commission says, well, no one has been paying attention to this for 20 years.

2129
02:51:58,777 --> 02:52:15,523
[SPEAKER_27]: And then we look at the terms of service of the members that are on the board, and we look at the council resolution from 2014, which asked that single home historic districts be sought after and be proactively identified prior to the request for a demolition permit.

2130
02:52:15,644 --> 02:52:16,384
[SPEAKER_27]: And that was something that...

2131
02:52:22,754 --> 02:52:25,195
[SPEAKER_14]: I frankly was not aware of this request.

2132
02:52:25,775 --> 02:52:28,976
[SPEAKER_27]: It happened at the budget when you were there asking for money.

2133
02:52:31,197 --> 02:52:32,937
[SPEAKER_14]: We were not asking for money in 2014.

2134
02:52:32,977 --> 02:52:34,338
[SPEAKER_14]: They just gave us a certain amount.

2135
02:52:49,451 --> 02:52:50,171
[SPEAKER_27]: So we were given the money.

2136
02:52:50,972 --> 02:52:52,252
[SPEAKER_27]: So that was six years ago.

2137
02:52:52,292 --> 02:52:59,215
[SPEAKER_27]: Can you tell me how many single home historic districts you've identified in the past six years, absent the demolition permit or a request from the MCD?

2138
02:53:01,156 --> 02:53:06,399
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, 21 Truelow is the only single house historic district we have identified.

2139
02:53:06,859 --> 02:53:15,603
[SPEAKER_14]: And that was with the consent of the owner and also at the extreme approval of the neighborhood

2140
02:53:23,487 --> 02:53:24,848
[SPEAKER_27]: So in 6 years there's been one.

2141
02:53:27,870 --> 02:53:29,672
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, this wasn't proactively identified.

2142
02:53:29,712 --> 02:53:35,376
[SPEAKER_27]: This was as a result of a demolition permit being pulled and then well, that was this was.

2143
02:53:37,358 --> 02:53:40,541
[SPEAKER_14]: This was identified by community activists.

2144
02:53:41,822 --> 02:53:42,142
[SPEAKER_27]: By what?

2145
02:53:43,123 --> 02:53:44,364
[SPEAKER_14]: My community activists.

2146
02:53:45,124 --> 02:53:48,067
[SPEAKER_14]: They were people who learned about tops plan to sell the building.

2147
02:53:50,134 --> 02:53:51,554
[SPEAKER_14]: without telling anyone.

2148
02:53:51,795 --> 02:53:55,777
[SPEAKER_14]: And someone found out, they notified us, and we began to hold three hearings.

2149
02:53:56,757 --> 02:53:58,698
[SPEAKER_27]: I know it's hard to sell a building if nobody knows about it.

2150
02:53:59,319 --> 02:54:00,720
[SPEAKER_27]: All right, thank you.

2151
02:54:00,740 --> 02:54:01,740
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll rest my case, Mr. President.

2152
02:54:01,760 --> 02:54:02,581
[SPEAKER_14]: No one tells us.

2153
02:54:04,061 --> 02:54:11,446
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, Tufts had a position, and Tufts, by the way, also owned Grandfather's House, and also sold that without telling us.

2154
02:54:12,746 --> 02:54:13,747
[SPEAKER_27]: They own it, aren't they allowed to?

2155
02:54:15,145 --> 02:54:16,285
[SPEAKER_14]: We are allowed to do that, yes.

2156
02:54:17,006 --> 02:54:25,789
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think that is correct, but I think, you know, going forward we need some changes to this whole procedure.

2157
02:54:25,909 --> 02:54:28,590
[SPEAKER_14]: Obviously the whole thing needs some changes.

2158
02:54:29,130 --> 02:54:43,896
[SPEAKER_14]: And every member of the Historical Commission, and I assume the Historical Commission as well, is willing to work with the City Council to come up with a better, more rational approach to creating historic districts.

2159
02:54:44,542 --> 02:54:49,126
[SPEAKER_27]: I think that's something we'd all appreciate, Mr. President, through you to Mr. Bader.

2160
02:54:50,287 --> 02:54:53,089
[SPEAKER_27]: Mr. President, I do have a last question, and I'll rest my case at this.

2161
02:54:53,910 --> 02:55:05,719
[SPEAKER_27]: At the council meeting when this issue was brought up and at the subsequent subcommittee meeting, I did ask a question to the city solicitor as to whether or not the criteria

2162
02:55:07,081 --> 02:55:15,893
[SPEAKER_27]: the circumstances of this particular property could constitute a regulatory taking, opening up the city of Medford to financial or other liabilities.

2163
02:55:16,394 --> 02:55:23,804
[SPEAKER_27]: And I'm wondering if you've received a response, or the city clerk maybe has received a response relative to that question of law that we asked the city solicitor.

2164
02:55:25,429 --> 02:55:28,030
[SPEAKER_04]: I have not received a response.

2165
02:55:28,110 --> 02:55:31,152
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew she was working on one, but I have not received a response yet.

2166
02:55:31,292 --> 02:55:31,532
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

2167
02:55:32,372 --> 02:55:47,079
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not aware, but my understanding is I do read the Massachusetts historical list, which is followed by every historic district in Massachusetts.

2168
02:55:47,579 --> 02:55:52,041
[SPEAKER_14]: And the uniform consensus is this is not taking.

2169
02:55:52,061 --> 02:55:53,742
[SPEAKER_14]: This is simply like the zoning change.

2170
02:55:54,764 --> 02:56:01,905
[SPEAKER_27]: The consensus by the four members of the Historical District Commission, the consensus of a land court judge, the consensus of whom?

2171
02:56:03,005 --> 02:56:04,126
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry, I didn't hear the question.

2172
02:56:05,306 --> 02:56:08,226
[SPEAKER_27]: You said it was the consensus that this is not a regulatory taking.

2173
02:56:08,887 --> 02:56:12,827
[SPEAKER_14]: It is not just the consensus of our commission.

2174
02:56:12,847 --> 02:56:22,069
[SPEAKER_14]: It is the consensus of the Massachusetts State Historical Commission and of historic districts all over the state.

2175
02:56:22,941 --> 02:56:27,462
[SPEAKER_27]: So the district commission conducted a three-prong test to determine whether or not it was a taking?

2176
02:56:31,884 --> 02:56:34,945
[SPEAKER_14]: It is taken for granted.

2177
02:56:35,265 --> 02:56:42,887
[SPEAKER_14]: And as I say, I'm not a lawyer, but it is taken for granted that this is just like zoning, and it is not a taking.

2178
02:56:42,907 --> 02:56:45,908
[SPEAKER_14]: I believe this has been adjudicated, and I do not know the details.

2179
02:56:46,408 --> 02:56:46,728
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

2180
02:56:46,868 --> 02:56:48,829
[SPEAKER_27]: So I think that opinion might be important, Mr. President.

2181
02:56:48,969 --> 02:56:49,409
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you very much.

2182
02:56:49,629 --> 02:56:50,529
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

2183
02:56:51,230 --> 02:56:51,930
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Bears.

2184
02:56:52,366 --> 02:56:53,386
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2185
02:56:54,047 --> 02:57:01,409
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, one other expert opinion we consulted was the building commissioner, Mr. Moki, and he did not mandate that the building be demolished.

2186
02:57:01,489 --> 02:57:05,430
[SPEAKER_25]: So I just think we need to consider the variety of opinions that we've heard.

2187
02:57:07,711 --> 02:57:18,475
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, I think it seems everyone's in agreement that a process needs to be developed or modified in the future around historic districts and demolition delay.

2188
02:57:18,495 --> 02:57:21,796
[SPEAKER_25]: That's not the paper before us tonight.

2189
02:57:22,825 --> 02:57:28,107
[SPEAKER_25]: It's not anything we do on that is not going to address what we've gotten up to this point on this specific issue.

2190
02:57:28,127 --> 02:57:48,176
[SPEAKER_25]: It seems to me that when we were at our Committee of the Whole meeting a couple weeks ago, that we felt okay about a kind of tentative compromise that was put in place that would lead to members of, well, at that point, I guess, members of our Historical Commission and members of our Historical District Commission

2191
02:57:49,693 --> 02:58:05,094
[SPEAKER_25]: Negotiating in faith with the property owner to come to a reasonable agreement around some element of preservation of this property or on this property that would allow the property owner to develop the type of structure that they want to develop while maintaining the

2192
02:58:07,398 --> 02:58:10,599
[SPEAKER_25]: some element of the historical significance of that property.

2193
02:58:11,299 --> 02:58:12,479
[SPEAKER_25]: That's what we're debating tonight.

2194
02:58:12,759 --> 02:58:13,940
[SPEAKER_25]: That's what we're discussing tonight.

2195
02:58:14,600 --> 02:58:20,081
[SPEAKER_25]: It seems to me that we have not yet reached the good faith compromise we wanted to.

2196
02:58:20,381 --> 02:58:22,582
[SPEAKER_25]: I think one of those reasons, again, is the timeline.

2197
02:58:23,342 --> 02:58:27,303
[SPEAKER_25]: The 17 meetings where this was on an agenda for the historical commission.

2198
02:58:27,323 --> 02:58:29,824
[SPEAKER_25]: That was not, you know.

2199
02:58:31,984 --> 02:58:42,749
[SPEAKER_27]: I think I believe that the last meeting I asked for a copy of the letters that was sent to Mr. Goldschneider, inviting him to these 17 consecutive meetings that had him on the agenda that said we're asking you to come and present.

2200
02:58:43,189 --> 02:58:49,092
[SPEAKER_27]: Because the way that I see their agenda is that everything that they have going on, they just throw on the agenda and put it out every week and whatever comes up, comes up.

2201
02:58:49,812 --> 02:58:59,117
[SPEAKER_27]: So although it might have been on the agenda for 17 months, I don't believe that the gentleman was invited to appear to any of these meetings over that period of time but for one or two.

2202
02:59:00,663 --> 02:59:02,164
[SPEAKER_25]: Mr. President, thank you.

2203
02:59:02,184 --> 02:59:10,110
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, I would expect someone making a multi-hundred thousand dollar investment with the potential of a multi-million dollar profit would be paying attention to things like that.

2204
02:59:10,511 --> 02:59:14,213
[SPEAKER_27]: Can the gentleman please provide me with the information that he just received and what expert provided it to him?

2205
02:59:14,233 --> 02:59:18,076
[SPEAKER_27]: A multi-million dollar contract, a multi-million dollar project, a multi-million dollar property?

2206
02:59:18,116 --> 02:59:19,798
[SPEAKER_27]: I think that that's not what I said.

2207
02:59:19,958 --> 02:59:23,621
[SPEAKER_25]: That's not what I said, so I think anyone in the city knows.

2208
02:59:24,281 --> 02:59:27,302
[SPEAKER_25]: how much this building was purchased for as it's public information.

2209
02:59:27,322 --> 02:59:34,243
[SPEAKER_25]: And anyone knows that if we're building multiple units for sale on that property, that it would also be worth millions of dollars.

2210
02:59:34,283 --> 02:59:36,163
[SPEAKER_25]: I think that's reflective of the market conditions.

2211
02:59:37,224 --> 02:59:42,405
[SPEAKER_25]: In any case, what we're voting on is the specific historic nature of this district.

2212
02:59:43,265 --> 02:59:47,466
[SPEAKER_25]: And I think we're all in agreement that there's a good faith compromise that needs to come out of this.

2213
02:59:47,986 --> 02:59:51,567
[SPEAKER_25]: The timeline has been shrunk, and people can point fingers wherever they want.

2214
02:59:51,967 --> 02:59:53,067
[SPEAKER_25]: The timeline is what it is.

2215
02:59:53,847 --> 02:59:58,069
[SPEAKER_25]: 10 days to produce a rendering clearly wasn't sufficient to produce a rendering that people feel comfortable with.

2216
02:59:58,450 --> 03:00:02,932
[SPEAKER_25]: I think we need to vote for this tonight and allow the discussions and compromise to continue.

2217
03:00:03,212 --> 03:00:05,153
[SPEAKER_25]: That's what needs to happen.

2218
03:00:05,233 --> 03:00:11,817
[SPEAKER_25]: Otherwise, here we are, October 6, demo delays in two days, building gets knocked down, and then where are we?

2219
03:00:11,857 --> 03:00:13,438
[SPEAKER_25]: Maybe we don't even get a plank and a bench.

2220
03:00:13,518 --> 03:00:14,698
[SPEAKER_25]: I hope we do.

2221
03:00:15,999 --> 03:00:18,620
[SPEAKER_25]: We don't have so many tools in our toolbox.

2222
03:00:19,020 --> 03:00:21,341
[SPEAKER_25]: This has been waited out for 18 months with one of the tools.

2223
03:00:21,981 --> 03:00:24,942
[SPEAKER_25]: The other tool of the historic district is what's left.

2224
03:00:26,382 --> 03:00:30,664
[SPEAKER_25]: I think we should make sure that we continue to have the power to make sure that this compromise happens.

2225
03:00:32,024 --> 03:00:32,364
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

2226
03:00:35,970 --> 03:00:36,730
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2227
03:00:36,910 --> 03:00:42,493
[SPEAKER_28]: I do want to thank the Historic District Commission and Mr. Goldschneider for their work they've put into this.

2228
03:00:42,873 --> 03:00:51,897
[SPEAKER_28]: The crux of it for me is what was raised before is that there is, unless we pass this Historic District Commission, there's really no authority to ensure that that compromise happens.

2229
03:00:52,898 --> 03:00:57,280
[SPEAKER_28]: There's no guarantee that that will ever happen if we do not pass this Historic District Commission.

2230
03:00:57,800 --> 03:00:59,061
[SPEAKER_28]: So that's where it hinges on for me.

2231
03:00:59,581 --> 03:01:03,183
[SPEAKER_28]: I've heard from countless members of the community who are in favor of this commission.

2232
03:01:03,863 --> 03:01:08,666
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm sorry of this district and the only people I've heard who are against it are those who stand to profit off of it.

2233
03:01:08,766 --> 03:01:11,107
[SPEAKER_28]: So I'm in favor of this district.

2234
03:01:11,127 --> 03:01:14,429
[SPEAKER_28]: It has my support and I I just look forward to actually voting on this.

2235
03:01:14,970 --> 03:01:15,210
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

2236
03:01:16,527 --> 03:01:18,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Morell.

2237
03:01:18,788 --> 03:01:19,688
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Caraviello.

2238
03:01:19,708 --> 03:01:20,868
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we'll have Councilor Matz.

2239
03:01:20,888 --> 03:01:21,728
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Caraviello.

2240
03:01:22,309 --> 03:01:23,049
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2241
03:01:23,069 --> 03:01:28,270
[SPEAKER_26]: I think Mr. President, Mr. Bailey mentioned it's a procedure.

2242
03:01:28,570 --> 03:01:31,731
[SPEAKER_26]: And I think the whole thing here is because of the procedure.

2243
03:01:36,108 --> 03:01:41,850
[SPEAKER_26]: The historical group was tasked five years ago to go out and identify historical pieces of property.

2244
03:01:42,350 --> 03:01:47,412
[SPEAKER_26]: And currently, the procedure is, you buy the property for us, and then we'll tell you if it's historical.

2245
03:01:47,852 --> 03:01:53,454
[SPEAKER_26]: That's- I mean, this is not the procedure that you should have.

2246
03:01:53,474 --> 03:01:56,114
[SPEAKER_26]: Point of information.

2247
03:01:56,255 --> 03:01:57,475
[SPEAKER_26]: Point of information, Councilor Bears.

2248
03:01:58,198 --> 03:02:09,921
[SPEAKER_25]: Do we know that a letter was ever sent to the historic district commission about this issue, that they were notified that they should be embarking on this apparent journey to identify single district properties?

2249
03:02:10,001 --> 03:02:12,222
[SPEAKER_25]: Point of information, the chairman was present at the meeting.

2250
03:02:12,782 --> 03:02:13,722
[SPEAKER_25]: Point of information.

2251
03:02:16,863 --> 03:02:18,303
[SPEAKER_04]: Point of information council appears.

2252
03:02:18,463 --> 03:02:20,884
[SPEAKER_27]: Could the clerk provide a record of such communication?

2253
03:02:22,044 --> 03:02:26,225
[SPEAKER_27]: Adopted by the city council in the form of minutes and forwarded to the proper authorities, Mr. President.

2254
03:02:27,236 --> 03:02:27,556
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

2255
03:02:27,896 --> 03:02:28,557
[SPEAKER_27]: Did it happen?

2256
03:02:29,357 --> 03:02:30,818
[SPEAKER_27]: That's obviously not.

2257
03:02:31,118 --> 03:02:32,278
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

2258
03:02:32,299 --> 03:02:34,319
[SPEAKER_26]: Vice President Caraviello, please continue.

2259
03:02:34,380 --> 03:02:36,040
[SPEAKER_26]: Again, it's a procedure.

2260
03:02:36,340 --> 03:02:37,021
[SPEAKER_26]: That's the problem.

2261
03:02:37,061 --> 03:02:43,064
[SPEAKER_26]: It's not whether the district is good or bad, it's a procedure.

2262
03:02:46,886 --> 03:02:49,927
[SPEAKER_26]: This property was purchased 18 months ago.

2263
03:02:50,487 --> 03:02:52,468
[SPEAKER_26]: They didn't get around to it until month 16.

2264
03:02:53,939 --> 03:03:03,708
[SPEAKER_26]: So now the burden is on us, because everyone sat on it for a year and a half, all this time, and now the burden is on this group to do a last minute decision.

2265
03:03:04,569 --> 03:03:07,532
[SPEAKER_26]: Where were you the last 16 months negotiating with this guy?

2266
03:03:09,662 --> 03:03:18,671
[SPEAKER_26]: Did nothing happen during the 16 months that you had to wait until August 28th, the end of the August meeting, to decide that you wanted to make this a historical news?

2267
03:03:18,951 --> 03:03:24,696
[SPEAKER_26]: Why couldn't you have decided that in February of 19, when this was put in?

2268
03:03:26,158 --> 03:03:30,562
[SPEAKER_26]: So I don't think it's fair to this group to put us in this position that wasn't created by us.

2269
03:03:35,442 --> 03:03:41,587
[SPEAKER_29]: As we noted, there's guidelines from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts on how to establish districts.

2270
03:03:42,488 --> 03:03:44,349
[SPEAKER_29]: It has to go to Mass Historical Commission.

2271
03:03:44,389 --> 03:03:47,792
[SPEAKER_29]: We have to write up a Form B. We have to take a public vote.

2272
03:03:47,812 --> 03:03:49,113
[SPEAKER_29]: We have to have a public hearing.

2273
03:03:49,534 --> 03:03:50,635
[SPEAKER_29]: You had 16 months.

2274
03:03:51,773 --> 03:03:54,054
[SPEAKER_29]: And it's tricky for an 18-month demo delay.

2275
03:03:54,194 --> 03:03:58,996
[SPEAKER_29]: And we have a hard time getting our agenda done every month as it is.

2276
03:03:59,836 --> 03:04:02,177
[SPEAKER_29]: And I'm sorry you're in this position.

2277
03:04:02,257 --> 03:04:04,058
[SPEAKER_29]: I agree that it's a difficult spot for you.

2278
03:04:04,118 --> 03:04:07,239
[SPEAKER_29]: We're in a difficult position as well that we had to vote on this last night.

2279
03:04:07,800 --> 03:04:10,901
[SPEAKER_29]: So I don't disagree that this is a difficult position for us.

2280
03:04:11,021 --> 03:04:12,261
[SPEAKER_29]: We'd like to be in a better place.

2281
03:04:12,902 --> 03:04:15,723
[SPEAKER_29]: And we're willing to work with the council and the city as well.

2282
03:04:16,623 --> 03:04:21,448
[SPEAKER_29]: streamline and get a better understanding of the historic nature of so many properties here in our city.

2283
03:04:21,949 --> 03:04:25,352
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, if there's so many properties, why aren't you identifying them?

2284
03:04:25,933 --> 03:04:26,313
[SPEAKER_29]: We are.

2285
03:04:26,373 --> 03:04:27,234
[SPEAKER_29]: Where are they?

2286
03:04:27,294 --> 03:04:27,915
[SPEAKER_26]: Where's the list?

2287
03:04:28,015 --> 03:04:28,956
[SPEAKER_26]: I haven't seen a list.

2288
03:04:29,116 --> 03:04:32,920
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't think anybody in this group has seen a list of properties that have been identified.

2289
03:04:38,595 --> 03:04:42,936
[SPEAKER_29]: Well, we're working on a district now, so we hope to be able to present that to you.

2290
03:04:42,956 --> 03:04:49,978
[SPEAKER_26]: Again, until you guys come up with a procedure, this is going to happen every time somebody buys a property.

2291
03:04:51,058 --> 03:04:52,578
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't think that's true.

2292
03:04:52,738 --> 03:04:57,359
[SPEAKER_29]: But as I say, we're bound by the rules of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

2293
03:04:57,379 --> 03:04:59,120
[SPEAKER_29]: We're very specific on how to do this.

2294
03:04:59,540 --> 03:05:00,580
[SPEAKER_29]: And they're time-consuming.

2295
03:05:00,620 --> 03:05:02,821
[SPEAKER_29]: It's not easy to create a local historic district.

2296
03:05:03,261 --> 03:05:04,681
[SPEAKER_29]: It's meant to be a difficult hurdle.

2297
03:05:06,315 --> 03:05:15,621
[SPEAKER_26]: Again, 16 months has gone by, 17 months has gone by, and now we're here at the 18th hour with the panic being put on us.

2298
03:05:17,803 --> 03:05:19,223
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't disagree with that.

2299
03:05:19,244 --> 03:05:19,864
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, thank you.

2300
03:05:20,424 --> 03:05:21,985
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Vice President Caraviello.

2301
03:05:22,005 --> 03:05:24,427
[SPEAKER_04]: We have Councilor Markston, Councilor Bears, Councilor Marks.

2302
03:05:28,973 --> 03:05:49,530
[SPEAKER_02]: From what I recall, Mr. President, as part of the discussions that took place at the site, in addition, Mr. President, to agreeing that the owner of the property would come back with a couple of schematics of potential designs to save the front facade.

2303
03:05:49,930 --> 03:05:58,077
[SPEAKER_02]: It was also mentioned at that meeting, Mr. President, that there would be no pursuit of the creation of a local historic district.

2304
03:05:58,908 --> 03:06:00,469
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was part of the discussion.

2305
03:06:00,970 --> 03:06:12,780
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I know Ryan Haywood is on the phone, and I know he doesn't speak for the Historical District Commission, but I think the Historic District Commission should realize what was proposed at that particular meeting.

2306
03:06:13,280 --> 03:06:16,222
[SPEAKER_02]: And it wasn't horse trading that took place, Mr. President.

2307
03:06:16,523 --> 03:06:20,286
[SPEAKER_02]: This was an open public meeting that anyone was welcome to attend.

2308
03:06:20,826 --> 03:06:32,950
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm really surprised that some members of the Historical District Commission only found their way to this particular property within the last few days after this being around for 18 months, Mr. President.

2309
03:06:33,290 --> 03:06:35,070
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's even more alarming to me.

2310
03:06:35,610 --> 03:06:46,894
[SPEAKER_02]: Secondly, Mr. President, from what we heard tonight, the Historical District Commission has no say, Mr. President, in whether or not they like the rendering or not.

2311
03:06:47,776 --> 03:06:49,557
[SPEAKER_02]: They have no say in that, Mr. President.

2312
03:06:50,077 --> 03:06:51,518
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we heard tonight.

2313
03:06:52,498 --> 03:06:56,560
[SPEAKER_02]: So the vote that they took Monday night, I'm confused.

2314
03:06:56,580 --> 03:07:03,103
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that a vote against the rendering or was that a vote to accept the mayor's revised ordinance?

2315
03:07:03,883 --> 03:07:05,324
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a little confused, Mr. President.

2316
03:07:06,484 --> 03:07:08,685
[SPEAKER_02]: Chris, could you please clarify for Councilor Marks?

2317
03:07:13,607 --> 03:07:14,288
[SPEAKER_04]: One second.

2318
03:07:20,502 --> 03:07:22,504
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, yes, I can clarify that.

2319
03:07:24,425 --> 03:07:30,391
[SPEAKER_14]: Basically, we, my understanding was that we agreed to negotiate in good faith.

2320
03:07:31,852 --> 03:07:39,338
[SPEAKER_14]: We saw, we did not agree to anything specifically because no member of the historic district commission was there.

2321
03:07:43,221 --> 03:07:47,205
[SPEAKER_14]: And we were not, we simply want a negotiation to continue.

2322
03:07:48,089 --> 03:07:52,994
[SPEAKER_14]: We will negotiate in good faith, and I think Mr. Goldschneider will do the same.

2323
03:07:53,114 --> 03:07:57,798
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Chris, just so I understand, what was the actual vote last night then?

2324
03:07:59,420 --> 03:08:12,492
[SPEAKER_14]: The actual vote last night was to request that the council create this local historic district so that negotiation could continue and so that we could

2325
03:08:15,006 --> 03:08:23,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so I was under the impression that there was a vote taken not to accept the two renderings from the petitioner.

2326
03:08:45,695 --> 03:09:00,542
[SPEAKER_02]: So, at this particular point, Mr. President, I'd like to hear from Ryan Haywood from the historic commission, and then also hear from the petitioner once again, Mr. President, because I know he had additional information to present.

2327
03:09:00,562 --> 03:09:00,983
[SPEAKER_04]: That's fine.

2328
03:09:01,403 --> 03:09:03,664
[SPEAKER_04]: I am going to try to unmute Ryan Haywood.

2329
03:09:03,704 --> 03:09:04,784
[SPEAKER_04]: I had issues before.

2330
03:09:04,804 --> 03:09:05,205
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

2331
03:09:06,225 --> 03:09:07,185
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go, Ryan.

2332
03:09:12,168 --> 03:09:12,448
[SPEAKER_04]: Ryan?

2333
03:09:14,361 --> 03:09:14,701
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

2334
03:09:14,741 --> 03:09:18,844
[SPEAKER_04]: What can I do for you, Chairman?

2335
03:09:19,184 --> 03:09:21,346
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you have a specific question you had for Ryan Haywood?

2336
03:09:22,721 --> 03:09:27,405
[SPEAKER_02]: My question was, Ryan was present during this entire process.

2337
03:09:28,266 --> 03:09:35,452
[SPEAKER_02]: And I didn't know if he had any interaction the day after that we spoke about this.

2338
03:09:35,832 --> 03:09:45,661
[SPEAKER_02]: Did he have any interactions with any members of the Historical District Commission in regards to what was presented and somewhat agreed upon at the time?

2339
03:09:46,701 --> 03:09:58,347
[SPEAKER_02]: I know he had no authority to agree on behalf of another group, but I'd like to know a little more, Mr. President, about what took place on this, Mr. President.

2340
03:09:58,387 --> 03:10:09,013
[SPEAKER_16]: The committee of the whole was that I did not speak on behalf of both commissions, but that I agree that they would both see the proposed design that we discussed.

2341
03:10:09,173 --> 03:10:15,516
[SPEAKER_16]: And of course, I delivered on delivering that rendering to both boards, which I sent to

2342
03:10:17,302 --> 03:10:28,447
[SPEAKER_16]: to review and in both cases, it seems that we all agree that the design needed work.

2343
03:10:30,067 --> 03:10:32,668
[SPEAKER_16]: That's the easiest thing to say.

2344
03:10:32,688 --> 03:10:42,593
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, I think that a resolution could be reached, but we will have no standing after two days from now.

2345
03:10:43,323 --> 03:10:56,087
[SPEAKER_16]: And, you know, I think that I and Chris and others have done an excellent job clarifying how this whole process has gone through and perhaps gone a bit screwy.

2346
03:10:56,887 --> 03:11:04,229
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think I need to reiterate for the general public all of the, you know, all of those same points again over.

2347
03:11:05,050 --> 03:11:06,310
[SPEAKER_16]: I think Chris did a good job.

2348
03:11:06,910 --> 03:11:12,692
[SPEAKER_16]: And, you know, I think that we're just here now just, you know, continuing with the process.

2349
03:11:14,587 --> 03:11:19,050
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm happy to answer other questions if you have specific things.

2350
03:11:19,170 --> 03:11:34,942
[SPEAKER_02]: Ryan, if I could, was there not mentioned at the Committee of the Whole site review that if the renderings were acceptable, that there wouldn't be a pursuit of the creation of a local historic district?

2351
03:11:36,906 --> 03:11:38,947
[SPEAKER_16]: I didn't hear that if that was discussed.

2352
03:11:39,267 --> 03:11:52,910
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, I seem to understand that maybe if a revolution were reached between the developer and the historical staff and the stakeholders, that maybe we wouldn't have to do that.

2353
03:11:54,230 --> 03:12:05,073
[SPEAKER_16]: My understanding was that once the commission would review it, we would provide feedback, and Ari would react to that, and maybe we would

2354
03:12:05,854 --> 03:12:07,635
[SPEAKER_16]: not move forward or move forward.

2355
03:12:07,655 --> 03:12:10,676
[SPEAKER_16]: But I was not clear on that after the Committee of the Whole.

2356
03:12:11,357 --> 03:12:11,977
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

2357
03:12:12,097 --> 03:12:13,938
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, did you just say Historic Commission?

2358
03:12:15,419 --> 03:12:16,279
[SPEAKER_16]: Ryan?

2359
03:12:16,699 --> 03:12:20,421
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, the Historical Commission and Historic District Committee reviewed the drawings.

2360
03:12:20,541 --> 03:12:24,283
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, both of them are people that are in this process.

2361
03:12:24,423 --> 03:12:27,425
[SPEAKER_02]: So when did the Historic Commission meet to review the drawings?

2362
03:12:29,506 --> 03:12:30,466
[SPEAKER_16]: We did not meet.

2363
03:12:30,866 --> 03:12:32,787
[SPEAKER_16]: Individual comments were passed to me

2364
03:12:34,562 --> 03:12:41,427
[SPEAKER_16]: both of the architects responded with information on what they felt the design was lacking.

2365
03:12:42,267 --> 03:12:50,633
[SPEAKER_16]: And the other commissioners just sent small statements saying that the design needs work and that the dialogue needs to continue.

2366
03:12:52,254 --> 03:12:54,936
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was the opinion of the historic commission, correct?

2367
03:12:55,777 --> 03:12:56,257
[SPEAKER_16]: Correct.

2368
03:12:57,538 --> 03:12:57,658
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

2369
03:12:59,619 --> 03:13:01,100
[SPEAKER_27]: Point of information, Councilor Knight.

2370
03:13:01,560 --> 03:13:06,082
[SPEAKER_27]: That sounds an awful lot like deliberation to me, Mr. President, absent a public meeting notice.

2371
03:13:07,322 --> 03:13:09,763
[SPEAKER_27]: And I think that that's something that we better be very careful of.

2372
03:13:12,204 --> 03:13:26,450
[SPEAKER_27]: Individual members of a board of commission passing private notes to the chairman of the commission to be passed on to another board of commission that reflects their opinion, that's done behind closed doors, not in the open sunset of day, I think is a problem, Mr. President.

2373
03:13:26,590 --> 03:13:28,931
[SPEAKER_27]: And I think that that might rise to

2374
03:13:30,848 --> 03:13:32,929
[SPEAKER_27]: the level of violation.

2375
03:13:34,030 --> 03:13:39,152
[SPEAKER_27]: And as public employees, we need to be very careful in that regard.

2376
03:13:40,353 --> 03:13:45,535
[SPEAKER_29]: We at the Historic District Commission, we're not privy to any of the comments from the Historical Commission.

2377
03:13:46,616 --> 03:13:49,658
[SPEAKER_29]: I have no idea what the other architects on the Historical Commission said.

2378
03:13:49,698 --> 03:13:53,559
[SPEAKER_29]: We on the District Commission did meet in public meeting and reviewed them.

2379
03:13:54,080 --> 03:14:00,203
[SPEAKER_27]: Did anybody from the Historical Commission appear before the Historic District Commission and give an opinion as to what they felt?

2380
03:14:01,391 --> 03:14:03,132
[SPEAKER_29]: No.

2381
03:14:03,652 --> 03:14:08,353
[SPEAKER_27]: Was that opinion reflective of the board or the individual?

2382
03:14:09,374 --> 03:14:10,894
[SPEAKER_16]: My individual.

2383
03:14:12,535 --> 03:14:17,537
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'd just like to clarify that I'm not the chair of the Historical Commission at this given time.

2384
03:14:20,578 --> 03:14:23,219
[SPEAKER_27]: A member, a chair, same thing.

2385
03:14:23,239 --> 03:14:26,560
[SPEAKER_27]: There's deliberation that's going on behind closed doors, Mr. President, that's a problem.

2386
03:14:27,600 --> 03:14:28,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

2387
03:14:28,561 --> 03:14:29,581
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Marks, you have the floor.

2388
03:14:30,795 --> 03:14:37,542
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, if we could hear from the petitioner and whatever he'd like to present as well.

2389
03:14:37,822 --> 03:14:38,122
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

2390
03:14:40,925 --> 03:14:42,046
[SPEAKER_04]: Ari, I just unmuted you.

2391
03:14:42,786 --> 03:14:43,827
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, thank you, President.

2392
03:14:43,847 --> 03:14:48,412
[SPEAKER_15]: So two points regarding timeline, and then I'd like to

2393
03:14:51,431 --> 03:14:53,592
[SPEAKER_15]: kicking it over to Adam Glassman.

2394
03:14:53,732 --> 03:15:00,337
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, two points on the timeline, and then I'd like to touch on site plan review, and then if we could actually look at the drawings, I think that would be helpful.

2395
03:15:00,797 --> 03:15:02,778
[SPEAKER_15]: So two points on timeline.

2396
03:15:04,199 --> 03:15:15,566
[SPEAKER_15]: The historic district commission and historic district, the historic commission and historic district commission on July 17, 2019 jointly prepared a preliminary study

2397
03:15:21,079 --> 03:15:22,900
[SPEAKER_15]: I was not notified that this is going on.

2398
03:15:23,600 --> 03:15:24,560
[SPEAKER_15]: I was not notified.

2399
03:15:49,673 --> 03:15:50,053
[SPEAKER_15]: being done.

2400
03:15:50,694 --> 03:15:51,354
[SPEAKER_15]: behind the scenes here.

2401
03:16:11,488 --> 03:16:16,250
[SPEAKER_15]: why saving the building was not possible multiple times, documented times.

2402
03:16:16,710 --> 03:16:23,433
[SPEAKER_15]: And they basically said, yeah, there's no reason to add it to the agenda if you're not, if your plan doesn't involve reuse.

2403
03:16:24,640 --> 03:16:26,381
[SPEAKER_15]: this discussion, you know,

2404
03:16:53,334 --> 03:16:58,817
[SPEAKER_15]: To the extent this project is more than five units, it goes forward.

2405
03:17:00,498 --> 03:17:10,243
[SPEAKER_15]: It's under the purview of the site plan review, where the community has input, where the historic district commission members and the local historic district commission members have input.

2406
03:17:10,703 --> 03:17:12,945
[SPEAKER_15]: They're in contact with the community development team.

2407
03:17:12,965 --> 03:17:14,906
[SPEAKER_15]: They work alongside the community development team.

2408
03:17:15,866 --> 03:17:24,495
[SPEAKER_15]: My goal here was to negotiate with the site plan review board within community development.

2409
03:17:24,535 --> 03:17:30,402
[SPEAKER_15]: And that would be the board that would basically approve the design.

2410
03:17:31,062 --> 03:17:37,109
[SPEAKER_15]: It makes me a bit uncomfortable having a local historic district created here

2411
03:17:39,867 --> 03:17:53,774
[SPEAKER_15]: from the members of the local historic district commission that this building cannot be reused when clearly, based on the walkthrough, based on discussions with the building commissioner, based on the report, I commissioned, I paid for,

2412
03:17:55,135 --> 03:17:55,355
[SPEAKER_15]: here.

2413
03:17:55,375 --> 03:17:55,455
[SPEAKER_15]: here.

2414
03:18:24,173 --> 03:18:28,136
[SPEAKER_15]: at the meeting two weeks ago.

2415
03:18:28,356 --> 03:18:29,437
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. Goldschneider.

2416
03:18:29,457 --> 03:18:31,178
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a point of information, Councilor Bears.

2417
03:18:31,818 --> 03:18:35,001
[SPEAKER_25]: Just a couple quick questions.

2418
03:18:36,001 --> 03:18:45,608
[SPEAKER_25]: Were you aware, Mr. Goldschneider, that this property was subject to review by the Historical Commission around demolition delay in July 2019?

2419
03:18:47,503 --> 03:18:50,284
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, that's why I put forward plans to discuss with them.

2420
03:18:50,304 --> 03:19:02,130
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, and this effort to work on the local historic district that you brought up from July 2019, was that on public meeting minutes that the public had access to?

2421
03:19:02,150 --> 03:19:04,171
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know.

2422
03:19:05,191 --> 03:19:07,572
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, I mean, the answer is yes.

2423
03:19:08,072 --> 03:19:15,296
[SPEAKER_25]: Were you checking the minutes of the commission because you knew that your property was under their review?

2424
03:19:16,357 --> 03:19:17,238
[SPEAKER_15]: just said it was.

2425
03:19:36,249 --> 03:19:38,650
[SPEAKER_15]: We can't put you on the agenda, there's nothing to talk about.

2426
03:19:38,910 --> 03:19:43,493
[SPEAKER_25]: First off, what you heard and what they said might be two different things, but you just said.

2427
03:19:43,513 --> 03:19:44,954
[SPEAKER_15]: I have emails of that.

2428
03:19:45,134 --> 03:19:50,557
[SPEAKER_25]: You just said, Mr. Goldschneider, you just said that you knew it was subject to their review.

2429
03:19:51,177 --> 03:19:52,117
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2430
03:19:52,518 --> 03:19:53,558
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Pierce.

2431
03:19:54,399 --> 03:19:57,240
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, we have, was it Mr. Glassman?

2432
03:19:58,401 --> 03:20:00,042
[SPEAKER_04]: Point of information, Councilor Scarpelli.

2433
03:20:00,482 --> 03:20:02,343
[SPEAKER_09]: Ken, the petitioner again.

2434
03:20:03,083 --> 03:20:04,424
[SPEAKER_09]: You're saying you have these emails?

2435
03:20:06,542 --> 03:20:07,422
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't hear you.

2436
03:20:07,462 --> 03:20:08,003
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

2437
03:20:08,023 --> 03:20:09,563
[SPEAKER_09]: You're saying you have these emails?

2438
03:20:11,024 --> 03:20:22,949
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, the quote was in the 16 Foster Court timeline of events saying, once you have a plan that involves re-use of the building, we'll discuss getting you on the agenda.

2439
03:20:23,769 --> 03:20:25,730
[SPEAKER_09]: So you have that.

2440
03:20:26,330 --> 03:20:29,031
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you have any other emails saying that you were on an agenda?

2441
03:20:30,011 --> 03:20:30,952
[SPEAKER_15]: That I was on an agenda?

2442
03:20:30,992 --> 03:20:34,193
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I have no emails from them saying that I was on an agenda.

2443
03:20:34,633 --> 03:20:36,234
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's why I didn't think

2444
03:20:37,332 --> 03:20:37,532
[SPEAKER_15]: I was.

2445
03:20:59,546 --> 03:21:05,930
[SPEAKER_09]: And then if I can, to our commission, are you familiar with this email that he's talking about?

2446
03:21:05,950 --> 03:21:08,351
[SPEAKER_09]: Because to me, this is a big issue.

2447
03:21:08,571 --> 03:21:10,572
[SPEAKER_09]: I think this is very important.

2448
03:21:14,034 --> 03:21:16,816
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, Chris Bader, do you want to answer that?

2449
03:21:20,718 --> 03:21:24,260
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure, I never sent such an email.

2450
03:21:24,460 --> 03:21:25,881
[SPEAKER_14]: This came from the historical commission.

2451
03:21:29,934 --> 03:21:31,755
[SPEAKER_14]: And I would never send such an email.

2452
03:21:32,275 --> 03:21:33,375
[SPEAKER_14]: Everything is negotiable.

2453
03:21:33,855 --> 03:21:38,657
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, as long as we have jurisdiction over the property, everything's negotiable.

2454
03:21:38,677 --> 03:21:48,700
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, so, and your idea that it was never construed that unless demolition is off the table, you're not welcome at a meeting?

2455
03:21:49,921 --> 03:21:50,341
[SPEAKER_14]: No, no.

2456
03:21:50,921 --> 03:21:52,382
[SPEAKER_14]: We will only consider demolition.

2457
03:21:52,462 --> 03:21:54,542
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I'd like to see that email.

2458
03:21:54,562 --> 03:21:54,882
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

2459
03:21:55,443 --> 03:21:56,523
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

2460
03:21:59,625 --> 03:22:03,274
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so let's see, I think Adam Glassman was going to speak next.

2461
03:22:03,334 --> 03:22:04,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Glassman.

2462
03:22:33,873 --> 03:22:39,355
[SPEAKER_17]: proposed designs unless we were showing how we would preserve the building.

2463
03:22:40,355 --> 03:22:42,936
[SPEAKER_17]: Between then and now, the tune has changed.

2464
03:22:42,996 --> 03:22:50,959
[SPEAKER_17]: Now they're saying, I'll entertain not preserving the building once they have jurisdiction over the design review.

2465
03:22:51,599 --> 03:22:53,640
We've got members of the historic commission

2466
03:23:03,490 --> 03:23:03,710
you know,

2467
03:23:45,768 --> 03:23:47,089
[SPEAKER_17]: show up for whatever reason.

2468
03:23:47,149 --> 03:23:47,669
We were there.

2469
03:23:48,309 --> 03:23:50,731
So they haven't done their reports.

2470
03:23:50,791 --> 03:23:54,733
They haven't done their structural investigations.

2471
03:23:55,193 --> 03:23:56,954
They haven't been to the site.

2472
03:23:56,974 --> 03:23:58,455
Many of them haven't been to the house.

2473
03:23:59,416 --> 03:24:04,899
And if the clock has run out, I think I blame some of these members for it.

2474
03:24:06,920 --> 03:24:12,263
They, Ryan, who Mr. Haywood was at the meeting representing the commission,

2475
03:24:53,353 --> 03:24:56,914
And so we produced a concept.

2476
03:24:56,994 --> 03:25:06,277
[SPEAKER_17]: Based on that, I explained at that site meeting that it would be dwarfed by whatever three-story structure we put behind it.

2477
03:25:06,557 --> 03:25:18,681
[SPEAKER_17]: In the concept plans we put together, we actually presented a three-story structure that was fairly historical in its detailing and its roof lines, its proportions.

2478
03:25:20,376 --> 03:25:23,519
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's exactly what we said would be at that site meeting.

2479
03:25:25,460 --> 03:25:37,651
[SPEAKER_17]: Now that they don't like the way it looks in front of a three-story building, they're offering to entertain a proposal that doesn't include it at all, if they like the design.

2480
03:25:39,833 --> 03:25:42,355
[SPEAKER_17]: The goal posts have been moving around a lot.

2481
03:25:43,476 --> 03:25:47,459
[SPEAKER_17]: And Ari's done everything he can to engage the commission.

2482
03:25:50,576 --> 03:25:53,737
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that's my piece.

2483
03:25:54,217 --> 03:25:56,818
[SPEAKER_15]: Does it make sense to walk through the drawings here?

2484
03:25:56,838 --> 03:25:59,459
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that at all helpful?

2485
03:26:00,419 --> 03:26:05,001
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, we're not really discussing the proposed five-unit structure.

2486
03:26:05,021 --> 03:26:06,661
[SPEAKER_17]: Everyone's seen the renderings.

2487
03:26:07,101 --> 03:26:17,564
[SPEAKER_17]: We produced what was asked for, which was to show us what it looks like to take the front part of the cape and integrate it into a design in some way.

2488
03:26:18,585 --> 03:26:19,225
That's what we've done.

2489
03:26:20,406 --> 03:26:27,430
[SPEAKER_17]: And the understanding was this pursuit of a one site historic district wouldn't continue.

2490
03:26:32,332 --> 03:26:33,193
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. Glosser.

2491
03:26:35,254 --> 03:26:35,994
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Bears.

2492
03:26:37,515 --> 03:26:38,716
[SPEAKER_25]: Just a few questions.

2493
03:26:40,517 --> 03:26:41,617
[SPEAKER_25]: Is this the end all be all?

2494
03:26:41,697 --> 03:26:45,139
[SPEAKER_25]: Is this proposed design that you've rendered and we've seen?

2495
03:26:45,179 --> 03:26:46,600
[SPEAKER_25]: Is that the final design?

2496
03:27:06,254 --> 03:27:06,514
[SPEAKER_17]: got it.

2497
03:27:06,534 --> 03:27:08,137
[SPEAKER_17]: So it

2498
03:27:29,724 --> 03:27:31,226
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, no, I understand that.

2499
03:27:31,266 --> 03:27:34,590
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm saying, you know, you're saying it's not a final, that the rendering is not final.

2500
03:27:34,630 --> 03:27:38,194
[SPEAKER_25]: There could be changes or adjustments to it, potentially.

2501
03:27:52,199 --> 03:27:52,899
[SPEAKER_25]: Got it, okay.

2502
03:27:54,119 --> 03:28:06,562
[SPEAKER_25]: And I guess my next question would be, you know, if the single house historic district is not approved tonight, are you planning to, when would demolition commence?

2503
03:28:06,582 --> 03:28:14,444
[SPEAKER_17]: I can't answer that, I don't know.

2504
03:28:14,464 --> 03:28:15,104
[SPEAKER_15]: To be determined.

2505
03:28:15,864 --> 03:28:16,364
[SPEAKER_25]: TBD.

2506
03:28:17,064 --> 03:28:20,325
[SPEAKER_25]: So I mean, I'm just saying, you know, we're all talking about the timeline here.

2507
03:28:21,345 --> 03:28:25,186
[SPEAKER_25]: clearly more discussions need to be had for all parties involved.

2508
03:28:25,906 --> 03:28:34,408
[SPEAKER_25]: So we have kind of a tentative, a non-legally binding agreement out there.

2509
03:28:35,769 --> 03:28:40,990
[SPEAKER_25]: Could part of fulfilling that be not demolishing it on Friday?

2510
03:28:41,010 --> 03:28:48,472
[SPEAKER_25]: I can't speak for Ari on that, but I just

2511
03:29:01,852 --> 03:29:01,932
[SPEAKER_17]: the.

2512
03:29:27,119 --> 03:29:28,941
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, it's a community process.

2513
03:29:29,561 --> 03:29:31,683
[SPEAKER_25]: But again, Ari, my question stands.

2514
03:29:31,723 --> 03:29:32,684
[SPEAKER_25]: I know Adam can't answer it.

2515
03:29:32,704 --> 03:29:33,545
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm wondering if you can.

2516
03:29:38,769 --> 03:29:42,772
[SPEAKER_25]: The question is, you know, there's a tentative agreement out there.

2517
03:29:42,832 --> 03:29:44,354
[SPEAKER_25]: It's not a legally binding agreement.

2518
03:29:44,794 --> 03:29:52,561
[SPEAKER_25]: Could part of that be we won't demolish it on Friday, or we'll give another 10 days for further discussion before we demolish the structure?

2519
03:29:53,612 --> 03:30:00,397
[SPEAKER_15]: So my understanding is that there's a community development and site plan review process.

2520
03:30:01,218 --> 03:30:11,606
[SPEAKER_15]: So there would be oversight here where the historic commission can provide input on that project.

2521
03:30:12,167 --> 03:30:19,293
[SPEAKER_15]: So it was my understanding that would be the governing body here, because they provide feedback to the zoning board.

2522
03:30:20,302 --> 03:30:20,562
[SPEAKER_25]: Right.

2523
03:30:21,043 --> 03:30:30,152
[SPEAKER_25]: Just my question is, does TBD mean that the building, the structure may be demolished before the community development board meetings or the site plan review process?

2524
03:30:31,293 --> 03:30:33,736
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, we all understand that the building can't be reused.

2525
03:30:34,417 --> 03:30:42,104
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm not sure what we're... The building can't be reused, so how does knocking the building down

2526
03:30:45,364 --> 03:30:46,885
[SPEAKER_15]: change what we end up designing there.

2527
03:30:47,385 --> 03:30:59,668
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, it seems here that the stakeholders involved are concerned that if you knock down the building prior to having some sort of agreement on what the future is around preservation on the property, then there may not be an agreement at all.

2528
03:30:59,688 --> 03:31:02,929
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't understand.

2529
03:31:04,229 --> 03:31:09,271
[SPEAKER_25]: What's, you know, the leverage here is that, you know, you can't knock down your property until we come to an agreement.

2530
03:31:09,371 --> 03:31:13,172
[SPEAKER_25]: If that leverage disappears, then you could knock down the property and not come to an agreement, correct?

2531
03:31:14,994 --> 03:31:19,337
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I have to come to agreement with the Community Development Board.

2532
03:31:19,357 --> 03:31:19,557
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah.

2533
03:31:20,938 --> 03:31:24,981
[SPEAKER_15]: Right, or else I won't be able to build the building.

2534
03:31:25,261 --> 03:31:25,421
[SPEAKER_27]: OK.

2535
03:31:25,441 --> 03:31:31,005
[SPEAKER_27]: Mr. President, with all due respect to the councilor, the gentleman's going to have to seek legal advice if he's willing to make that type of commitment.

2536
03:31:31,245 --> 03:31:31,325
OK.

2537
03:31:31,365 --> 03:31:32,646
[SPEAKER_27]: All right, that's fine.

2538
03:31:32,726 --> 03:31:36,048
[SPEAKER_25]: I was just wondering if we could, you know, there's a lot of gentleman's agreements going on.

2539
03:31:36,068 --> 03:31:39,230
[SPEAKER_25]: I feel like, you know, it doesn't really preclude anything or hasn't up to this point.

2540
03:31:40,347 --> 03:31:40,707
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm fine.

2541
03:31:40,727 --> 03:31:42,488
[SPEAKER_25]: Mr. President, I move approval on this paper.

2542
03:31:42,889 --> 03:31:43,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

2543
03:31:43,169 --> 03:32:00,339
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion of council, on the motion of council of bears to approve, uh, the paper, which is the established to establish a, uh, single, uh, I'm sorry to, uh, to, uh, approve a single parcel historic district.

2544
03:32:00,359 --> 03:32:03,561
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is seconded by seconded by councilor Morell.

2545
03:32:04,480 --> 03:32:05,701
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight, did you have a question?

2546
03:32:05,801 --> 03:32:06,661
[SPEAKER_27]: I did, Mr. President.

2547
03:32:06,701 --> 03:32:07,622
[SPEAKER_27]: Is Mr. Moki available?

2548
03:32:08,202 --> 03:32:08,862
[SPEAKER_04]: He is not available.

2549
03:32:08,882 --> 03:32:09,363
[SPEAKER_27]: He's not available.

2550
03:32:09,423 --> 03:32:10,363
[SPEAKER_27]: Is the city solicitor available?

2551
03:32:11,043 --> 03:32:15,486
[SPEAKER_04]: She could not attend tonight, but would be accessible, I think, if we reached out to her.

2552
03:32:15,746 --> 03:32:16,066
[SPEAKER_27]: All right.

2553
03:32:16,466 --> 03:32:17,867
[SPEAKER_27]: So I guess my question's to this.

2554
03:32:17,927 --> 03:32:27,852
[SPEAKER_27]: Number one, say that a rendering, say the rendering that we looked at tonight was suitable to both commissions.

2555
03:32:27,972 --> 03:32:29,833
[SPEAKER_27]: And they said, move forward and do what you got to do.

2556
03:32:30,773 --> 03:32:33,315
[SPEAKER_27]: The gentleman would still be subject to site plan review.

2557
03:32:34,667 --> 03:32:38,129
[SPEAKER_27]: through our office of community development, which is an open notorious process.

2558
03:32:38,829 --> 03:32:50,434
[SPEAKER_27]: During that site plan review process, because his parcel is an apartment two zone district, and there's a single family home there right now, or a two family home right there right now, it's being underutilized land use, number one.

2559
03:32:50,715 --> 03:32:56,818
[SPEAKER_27]: Number two, because it's a site plan review project, he's gonna be responsible to pay linkage, Mr. President, on top of going through the site plan review.

2560
03:32:56,838 --> 03:32:58,438
[SPEAKER_27]: He's also gonna have to pay linkage to the community.

2561
03:32:58,818 --> 03:33:01,120
[SPEAKER_27]: So we're looking at a parcel that's being underutilized, all right?

2562
03:33:01,200 --> 03:33:03,801
[SPEAKER_27]: If an apartment building gets built there, which is it's zoned use,

2563
03:33:05,211 --> 03:33:16,767
[SPEAKER_27]: The tax revenues are going to increase, we're going to be able to get linkage, and we still have two more processes in the review of the design that the city has the ability to take a bite at the apple on.

2564
03:33:16,847 --> 03:33:18,108
[SPEAKER_27]: I think that the gentleman has,

2565
03:33:20,211 --> 03:33:24,515
[SPEAKER_27]: taken a lot of wax in terms of this whole entire process.

2566
03:33:24,775 --> 03:33:32,041
[SPEAKER_27]: And he's maintained his cool a lot better than I would have been able to with the level of frustration that I think he's met.

2567
03:33:32,501 --> 03:33:36,245
[SPEAKER_27]: But ultimately, Mr. President, I don't think any of us behind this rail got in the business to hurt people.

2568
03:33:37,025 --> 03:33:38,607
[SPEAKER_27]: And the gentleman's being hurt by the process.

2569
03:33:40,250 --> 03:33:41,631
[SPEAKER_27]: The gentleman's being hurt by the process.

2570
03:33:41,671 --> 03:33:44,772
[SPEAKER_27]: And regardless of whether or not the process is what it is, it's not a good process.

2571
03:33:44,812 --> 03:33:45,572
[SPEAKER_27]: It needs to be fixed.

2572
03:33:46,112 --> 03:33:46,293
[SPEAKER_27]: All right?

2573
03:33:46,373 --> 03:33:50,474
[SPEAKER_27]: We took a bad vote when we changed the demolition delay from six months to 18 months, in my opinion.

2574
03:33:50,694 --> 03:33:51,635
[SPEAKER_27]: I think it was a bad vote.

2575
03:33:52,155 --> 03:33:52,675
[SPEAKER_27]: I really do.

2576
03:33:52,995 --> 03:33:56,797
[SPEAKER_27]: I also think it was a bad vote when we changed it to any building that was built in the last 75 years.

2577
03:33:56,917 --> 03:34:06,021
[SPEAKER_27]: I think it was a bad vote, Mr. President, because I feel like what we're doing is not really looking at historic preservation, but what we're looking at doing is a board that's trying to flex its muscles right now.

2578
03:34:06,921 --> 03:34:13,730
[SPEAKER_27]: All right, we see a board that's trying to increase its level of influence and power in the community because the corner office, we don't have the strongest leader right now.

2579
03:34:14,271 --> 03:34:20,099
[SPEAKER_27]: So I think, Mr. President, looking at this, you know what I mean, and the way that it's going, there's two more opportunities for design review.

2580
03:34:20,239 --> 03:34:22,783
[SPEAKER_27]: The parcel's a strange shaped parcel.

2581
03:34:22,823 --> 03:34:24,225
[SPEAKER_27]: It's going to have to go before the zoning board.

2582
03:34:25,093 --> 03:34:30,879
[SPEAKER_27]: It's already been noted in the meetings and noted in the discussions, and based upon the plan that's been presented, it's been determined.

2583
03:34:32,380 --> 03:34:35,243
[SPEAKER_27]: So this is nothing more, I think, than a power play at this point, Mr. President.

2584
03:34:35,323 --> 03:34:39,747
[SPEAKER_27]: And I certainly thank the Council if I'm moving it to a vote, and I'll be happy to vote against it this evening.

2585
03:34:41,108 --> 03:34:42,109
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Counsel Knight.

2586
03:34:42,430 --> 03:34:43,090
[SPEAKER_27]: Mr. President.

2587
03:34:43,831 --> 03:34:44,532
[SPEAKER_04]: Counsel Bears.

2588
03:34:46,704 --> 03:34:49,306
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, again, process, process, process.

2589
03:34:49,326 --> 03:34:50,366
[SPEAKER_25]: We're hearing about process.

2590
03:34:50,407 --> 03:34:54,729
[SPEAKER_25]: I agree we need to update and create a new process around the issue of historic preservation.

2591
03:34:54,749 --> 03:34:56,070
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't think anyone disagrees with that.

2592
03:34:56,651 --> 03:35:01,134
[SPEAKER_25]: Question before us tonight is does 16 Foster Court deserve historic status?

2593
03:35:01,634 --> 03:35:02,755
[SPEAKER_25]: I believe the answer is yes.

2594
03:35:03,435 --> 03:35:05,196
[SPEAKER_25]: We can say it's about something else.

2595
03:35:05,236 --> 03:35:06,838
[SPEAKER_25]: We can say it's about the corner office.

2596
03:35:06,858 --> 03:35:08,419
[SPEAKER_25]: We can say it's about boards and commissions.

2597
03:35:09,239 --> 03:35:10,080
[SPEAKER_25]: That's not the question.

2598
03:35:10,660 --> 03:35:11,581
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2599
03:35:12,121 --> 03:35:13,082
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

2600
03:35:14,531 --> 03:35:24,233
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so on the motion of Councilor Bears, seconded by Councilor Morell, to create a single parcel historic district at 16 Foster Court.

2601
03:35:25,113 --> 03:35:31,674
[SPEAKER_04]: In order to do that, it requires five votes to create a historic district.

2602
03:35:31,714 --> 03:35:32,914
[SPEAKER_04]: So it requires five.

2603
03:35:33,674 --> 03:35:40,215
[SPEAKER_04]: A yes vote is to establish the single parcel historic district.

2604
03:35:41,796 --> 03:35:43,396
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, yes vote is to create.

2605

2621
03:36:26,165 --> 03:36:27,045
[SPEAKER_04]: The motion fails.

2622
03:36:30,546 --> 03:36:32,007
[SPEAKER_04]: The historic district is not approved.

2623
03:36:32,027 --> 03:36:33,727
[SPEAKER_25]: Motion to revert to the regular order of business.

2624

2647
03:37:22,403 --> 03:37:23,044
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Marks.

2648
03:37:23,884 --> 03:37:24,964
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2649
03:37:25,865 --> 03:37:30,187
[SPEAKER_02]: I know contracts and negotiations between the administration and the unions.

2650
03:37:30,627 --> 03:37:36,890
[SPEAKER_02]: I would just ask if we can get an update on any current outstanding unsettled contracts within the city of Medford.

2651
03:37:39,090 --> 03:37:39,991
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Counsel Marx.

2652
03:37:40,571 --> 03:37:40,972
[SPEAKER_27]: Counsel Knight.

2653
03:37:41,012 --> 03:37:54,803
[SPEAKER_27]: Mr. President, if I could just offer an amendment to that paper, a re-paper to that amendment, that the administration provide us with a list of whether or not these contracts are being negotiated by internal counsel or external counsel, and the amount of money that they've spent on external counsel, if they have to do such.

2654
03:37:56,044 --> 03:38:03,310
[SPEAKER_04]: So do you have, Counsel, I'm sorry, Clerk Curtis, do you have the... I'm working on it, hang on, I'll be right back.

2655
03:38:39,298 --> 03:38:57,430
[SPEAKER_22]: All right, the B paper that I have, and I'm gonna read this back from Councilor Knight, is to have the administration provide a list of these contracts and whether these contracts are being negotiated by external counsel or internal counsel, and if external, the amount of money being spent on external counsel for these negotiations.

2656
03:38:57,830 --> 03:38:58,090
[SPEAKER_22]: Correct.

2657
03:38:58,710 --> 03:38:58,850
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay.

2658
03:38:58,870 --> 03:39:00,191
[SPEAKER_27]: And that can be in the form of a B paper.

2659
03:39:00,231 --> 03:39:00,872
[SPEAKER_27]: Is that correct?

2660
03:39:00,992 --> 03:39:05,615
[SPEAKER_27]: It can be in the form of a B paper or an amendment based upon the preference of the sponsor or the person.

2661
03:39:06,837 --> 03:39:08,317
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Marks, do you prefer a beat paper?

2662
03:39:08,357 --> 03:39:09,417
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have a preference.

2663
03:39:09,577 --> 03:39:12,838
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, we'll call it a... There you go.

2664
03:39:13,978 --> 03:39:15,919
[SPEAKER_04]: That is an amendment by Councilor Knight.

2665
03:39:16,539 --> 03:39:20,019
[SPEAKER_04]: So on the motion of... Are there any questions before I call the roll here?

2681
03:39:46,095 --> 03:39:46,335
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

2682
03:39:46,435 --> 03:39:47,795
[SPEAKER_04]: Seven affirmative, zero negative.

2683
03:39:47,815 --> 03:39:48,715
[SPEAKER_04]: The motion passes.

2684
03:39:48,735 --> 03:39:52,896
[SPEAKER_04]: 20-572 offered by Councilor Marks and Councilor Scarpelli.

2685
03:39:53,456 --> 03:40:00,078
[SPEAKER_04]: Be it resolved that the city repave the street in front of 69 to 77 Winslow Lab in the interest of public safety.

2686
03:40:00,138 --> 03:40:00,838
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Marks?

2687
03:40:01,618 --> 03:40:02,619
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2688
03:40:02,659 --> 03:40:05,962
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to thank Councilor Scott Pelly for co-sponsoring this.

2689
03:40:06,062 --> 03:40:10,566
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually both offered this, it was probably a little over a year ago.

2690
03:40:10,586 --> 03:40:22,816
[SPEAKER_02]: DPW was kind enough to go up to Winslow Ave and fill some of the many, many potholes that are lined in that stretch between 69 and 77 Winslow.

2691
03:40:23,216 --> 03:40:27,380
[SPEAKER_02]: However, Mr. President, I think we're at a time where we probably could use some

2692
03:40:27,760 --> 03:40:32,904
[SPEAKER_02]: curb-to-curb paving, even though one side of the street I don't believe has curbing.

2693
03:40:34,486 --> 03:40:38,489
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say, Mr. President, at this particular point, it's a small stretch.

2694
03:40:38,929 --> 03:40:40,551
[SPEAKER_02]: It's near Carpac.

2695
03:40:40,931 --> 03:40:44,074
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very heavy traveled area, as you know, Mr. President.

2696
03:40:44,434 --> 03:40:55,223
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would ask in the interest of public safety that that area be ground down between 69 and 77 Winslow Ave and repave curb-to-curb in the interest of public safety.

2697
03:40:55,723 --> 03:40:56,123
[SPEAKER_04]: Second.

2698
03:40:56,263 --> 03:40:57,023
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

2699
03:40:57,083 --> 03:40:58,084
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scott-Pelley.

2700
03:40:58,144 --> 03:41:05,405
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. Council President, and thank you, Councilor Marks, for co-sponsoring this resolution.

2701
03:41:05,845 --> 03:41:09,966
[SPEAKER_09]: I think those residents do a great job with their curb appeal.

2702
03:41:10,426 --> 03:41:11,586
[SPEAKER_09]: They do the best they can.

2703
03:41:12,266 --> 03:41:19,108
[SPEAKER_09]: Every time I drive by, they're out there with their push brooms, knocking all the debris away from their front doors.

2704
03:41:19,848 --> 03:41:25,289
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're very patient, and we know that our DPWs try valiantly to try to

2705
03:41:25,749 --> 03:41:35,121
[SPEAKER_09]: keep up with those potholes and they fill them on a, I think it's a weekly basis, but I think Councilor Mock said it perfectly.

2706
03:41:35,562 --> 03:41:36,943
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just, it's too far gone.

2707
03:41:37,144 --> 03:41:40,488
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not a huge stretch, but it does affect those homeowners.

2708
03:41:41,135 --> 03:41:48,459
[SPEAKER_09]: And truly in a negative way, especially with the way they live their lives, which is very orderly and very neat.

2709
03:41:48,499 --> 03:41:54,462
[SPEAKER_09]: So I hope that we could find a remedy for them and get that completely done.

2710
03:41:54,802 --> 03:41:57,383
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, like I said, it's not a big area.

2711
03:41:58,003 --> 03:41:59,544
[SPEAKER_09]: It's something we could just move in and move out.

2712
03:41:59,564 --> 03:42:00,485
[SPEAKER_09]: So I thank you so much.

2713
03:42:01,225 --> 03:42:02,306
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

2714
03:42:02,346 --> 03:42:04,907
[SPEAKER_04]: And the motion of, Vice President Caraviello.

2715
03:42:05,606 --> 03:42:22,774
[SPEAKER_26]: Mr. President, if Councilor Marks and Scott wouldn't mind if I amended the paper to having the DPW repave the driveway at 9 Canal Street, which is right beside the Bedford Housing Authority, where a woman fell off a wheelchair today and was seriously injured.

2716
03:42:23,435 --> 03:42:28,077
[SPEAKER_26]: Because of the sidewalk and the driveway is deteriorated from the cars running over it.

2717
03:42:28,757 --> 03:42:31,618
[SPEAKER_26]: If we could offer that in the form of a B paper, it would be appreciated.

2718
03:42:31,859 --> 03:42:32,459
[SPEAKER_04]: That's at 9 Canal?

2719
03:42:32,479 --> 03:42:32,819
[SPEAKER_04]: 9 Canal Street.

2720
03:42:35,473 --> 03:42:38,015
[SPEAKER_04]: 9 canals to it.

2721
03:42:39,216 --> 03:42:41,657
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's a B paper offered by Vice President Caraviello.

2722
03:42:42,078 --> 03:42:42,498
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes, sir.

2723
03:42:42,578 --> 03:42:42,798
[SPEAKER_26]: OK.

2724
03:42:43,739 --> 03:42:49,403
[SPEAKER_04]: On the B paper offered by Vice President Caraviello, seconded by Councilor Knight, Clerk Urnavis, please call the roll.

2725
03:42:54,046 --> 03:42:54,686
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Bears?

2726
03:42:55,026 --> 03:42:55,407
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

2727
03:42:56,407 --> 03:42:57,288
[SPEAKER_22]: Vice President Caraviello?

2728
03:42:57,328 --> 03:42:57,608
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

2729
03:42:58,308 --> 03:42:58,849
Councilor Knight?

2730
03:42:58,929 --> 03:42:59,189
Yes.

2731
03:43:00,230 --> 03:43:00,850
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Marks?

2732
03:43:01,030 --> 03:43:01,411
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2733
03:43:01,431 --> 03:43:02,711
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Morell?

2734
03:43:02,972 --> 03:43:03,172
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2735
03:43:04,155 --> 03:43:07,416
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

2736
03:43:28,712 --> 03:43:29,955
[SPEAKER_22]: motion passes.

2737
03:43:29,975 --> 03:43:29,955
2, 0, 5, 7,

2738
03:43:38,732 --> 03:43:51,422
[SPEAKER_04]: Be it ordained by the Medford City Council that the revised ordinances of the city of Medford, as most recently amended, is hereby further amended by changing the language of chapter 74.

2739

[SPEAKER_04]: For residential properties, if the owner does not comply within 24 hours of receiving notice, the city may in its discretion remove.

2756

[SPEAKER_04]: The fine for commercial property owners, $100 for the first offense and $200 for the second offense and subsequent offenses.

2764
03:47:42,234 --> 03:47:42,814
[SPEAKER_00]: Counsel Bears.

2765
03:47:43,375 --> 03:47:46,537
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Mr. President, and thank you for reading that whole thing.

2766
03:47:49,150 --> 03:47:50,671
[SPEAKER_25]: Snow shoveling is a perennial issue.

2767
03:47:50,711 --> 03:47:51,791
[SPEAKER_25]: It's a seasonal issue.

2768
03:47:51,811 --> 03:47:54,932
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm going to try to avoid bad wordplay and puns from here on out.

2769
03:47:55,813 --> 03:48:08,458
[SPEAKER_25]: But it's a major accessibility issue in our community for people with disabilities and for folks who, I mean, we just heard from Councilor, Vice President Caraviello, you know, people who might be in a mobility assistance device.

2770
03:48:10,540 --> 03:48:14,823
[SPEAKER_25]: who already are having trouble getting around our city when there's not snow and ice everywhere, right?

2771
03:48:15,784 --> 03:48:21,387
[SPEAKER_25]: So, you know, we have a current ordinance around snow shoveling and maintenance of our sidewalks.

2772
03:48:22,528 --> 03:48:29,413
[SPEAKER_25]: I think it's been a discussion of this council in the past and of the previous city administrations that that ordinance should be updated.

2773
03:48:30,573 --> 03:48:32,174
[SPEAKER_25]: It's insufficient in certain places.

2774
03:48:33,455 --> 03:48:38,096
[SPEAKER_25]: One example is that it's the occupant or tenant of a property who will be responsible for removal of snow.

2775
03:48:38,496 --> 03:48:40,197
[SPEAKER_25]: City doesn't necessarily have a record.

2776
03:48:40,897 --> 03:48:46,639
[SPEAKER_25]: We have a very good record of who owns property in this community, not necessarily occupants and tenants.

2777
03:48:48,079 --> 03:48:56,841
[SPEAKER_25]: And I think Councilor Marks actually noted that several hours ago now in our committee of the whole on the donation bin ordinance, right?

2778
03:48:56,882 --> 03:48:58,282
[SPEAKER_25]: We know who's on the property.

2779
03:48:58,322 --> 03:49:01,683
[SPEAKER_25]: We might not know every person who's putting up a bin in the same way.

2780
03:49:02,423 --> 03:49:03,223
[SPEAKER_25]: at least at this point.

2781
03:49:04,424 --> 03:49:14,067
[SPEAKER_25]: There's definitely a few issues with the, you know, both of the existing ordinance that the existing ordinance doesn't address and that I'm hoping we can iron out in a future subcommittee meeting on the proposed ordinance.

2782
03:49:15,167 --> 03:49:26,670
[SPEAKER_25]: One is the issue of corners and the city plow ends where the city may, you know, put some snow on a sidewalk or on a corridor or a private plow operator may do the same thing.

2783
03:49:28,331 --> 03:49:31,452
[SPEAKER_25]: Looking at some sort of exemption or alternate plan for

2784
03:49:31,952 --> 03:49:41,502
[SPEAKER_25]: the elderly and people with disabilities who may be property owners but may also not be able to remove snow and ice on their own or may not have access to the resources to pay someone to do it.

2785
03:49:42,483 --> 03:49:51,291
[SPEAKER_25]: And someone emailed me after this was on the agenda that the plows, the faster the plows go, the more snow gets thrown back onto the sidewalk after they have been

2786
03:49:52,172 --> 03:49:53,754
[SPEAKER_25]: So there's even issues like that.

2787
03:49:54,955 --> 03:49:57,317
[SPEAKER_25]: And the question of sand and maybe replacing that word.

2788
03:49:57,517 --> 03:50:05,365
[SPEAKER_25]: So the goal is to have this discussion soon in the Public Works Subcommittee to discuss any issues, improve the existing ordinance.

2789
03:50:05,485 --> 03:50:08,467
[SPEAKER_25]: And I would move to refer this item to the Public Works Subcommittee.

2790
03:50:08,487 --> 03:50:16,435
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, on the motion of Council, we ask to refer this to the Public Works Subcommittee, seconded by Councilor Morell.

2791
03:50:18,083 --> 03:50:18,903
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2792
03:50:19,163 --> 03:50:21,504
[SPEAKER_28]: I want to thank Councilor Bears for bringing this forward.

2793
03:50:21,544 --> 03:50:25,485
[SPEAKER_28]: I think I appreciate you bringing this forward before it starts snowing as well.

2794
03:50:25,665 --> 03:50:30,686
[SPEAKER_28]: I think we talk often about how difficult it can be to cross certain streets in this city when you add snow.

2795
03:50:30,746 --> 03:50:37,488
[SPEAKER_28]: When you add those super high barriers of snow on the corners, you're now dodging traffic and having to hurdle over a snow mound.

2796
03:50:38,368 --> 03:50:41,009
[SPEAKER_28]: So I really think this is a conversation we need to have.

2797
03:50:41,869 --> 03:50:47,632
[SPEAKER_28]: I appreciate the wording and the attention to who should be responsible as this paper is written.

2798
03:50:47,732 --> 03:50:50,794
[SPEAKER_28]: I do have either an amendment or a B paper I'd like to offer.

2799
03:50:50,874 --> 03:50:57,057
[SPEAKER_28]: I know the city of Somerville references how wide a clearing should be, as Councilor Bears did reference.

2800
03:50:57,518 --> 03:51:02,801
[SPEAKER_28]: This is really an accessibility issue, whether you're with a walker, a stroller, a wheelchair.

2801
03:51:03,601 --> 03:51:05,522
[SPEAKER_28]: you know, a narrow path isn't going to do it.

2802
03:51:05,602 --> 03:51:12,664
[SPEAKER_28]: I know there's some, some strange stuff with the profound number of private ways we have in Medford where there's a lot of non-conforming sidewalks in the first place.

2803
03:51:12,684 --> 03:51:23,227
[SPEAKER_28]: So I do wonder if there could be language, um, just to talk about the width of a safe passage for consideration for mobility and accessibility issues, um, in the form of a B paper or an amendment.

2804
03:51:24,007 --> 03:51:27,368
[SPEAKER_25]: I would be happy to entertain that as an amendment for further discussion in subcommittee.

2805
03:51:29,924 --> 03:51:32,886
[SPEAKER_25]: And my button is now stuck, so I'm going to try my best.

2806
03:51:33,526 --> 03:51:36,188
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is going to, was it Public Works?

2807
03:51:36,909 --> 03:51:37,469
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Bears?

2808
03:51:38,710 --> 03:51:40,071
[SPEAKER_04]: Public Works subcommittee, yep.

2809
03:51:40,191 --> 03:51:41,932
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have my sheet in front of me yet.

2810
03:51:41,952 --> 03:51:42,692
[SPEAKER_09]: I have it in front of me.

2811
03:51:42,712 --> 03:51:44,173
[SPEAKER_09]: Public Works.

2812
03:51:44,293 --> 03:51:45,234
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm the chair, I believe.

2813
03:51:45,314 --> 03:51:46,635
[SPEAKER_09]: It is Max Caraviellole.

2814
03:51:47,095 --> 03:51:47,495
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

2815
03:51:47,776 --> 03:51:48,556
[SPEAKER_04]: So that would be.

2816
03:51:48,576 --> 03:51:50,697
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, is that Public Works?

2817
03:51:50,717 --> 03:51:51,278
[SPEAKER_04]: Public Works, yes.

2818
03:51:51,858 --> 03:51:52,379
[SPEAKER_04]: So that would be.

2819
03:51:52,419 --> 03:51:53,539
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President?

2820
03:51:53,759 --> 03:51:54,880
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Clerk Hurtubise.

2821
03:51:55,260 --> 03:51:57,262
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm unclear on Council Morell's amendment.

2822
03:51:58,058 --> 03:51:58,298
[SPEAKER_28]: Sure.

2823
03:51:58,418 --> 03:52:16,703
[SPEAKER_28]: Could we add, I guess, the amendment would be to add to this discussion, focusing on the width of safe passage for consideration for wheelchairs, walkers, strollers, and anyone with mobility issues.

2824
03:52:18,563 --> 03:52:19,464
[SPEAKER_28]: Do you have that, Clerk Irvings?

2825
03:52:20,184 --> 03:52:20,884
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll work on it.

2826
03:52:39,121 --> 03:52:41,142
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm just going to make sure I have this correct, counselor.

2827
03:52:42,242 --> 03:52:49,684
You want to add to the discussion language regarding the width of safe passage for wheelchairs, strollers, and other mobility devices?

2828
03:52:50,164 --> 03:52:51,424
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that works.

2829
03:52:51,924 --> 03:52:52,184
[SPEAKER_22]: OK.

2830
03:52:54,405 --> 03:52:54,525
[SPEAKER_22]: OK.

2831
03:52:56,205 --> 03:52:56,706
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President.

2832
03:52:56,926 --> 03:52:57,106
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

2833
03:52:57,426 --> 03:52:57,706
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

2834
03:52:58,486 --> 03:53:05,588
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have a motion by Councilor Bears, seconded by Councilor Morell, as amended by Councilor Morell, Councilor Marks.

2835
03:53:06,359 --> 03:53:09,562
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President, and I want to thank Council Beers for bringing this up.

2836
03:53:10,503 --> 03:53:14,507
[SPEAKER_02]: There are many good aspects to this particular ordinance.

2837
03:53:15,228 --> 03:53:22,514
[SPEAKER_02]: With that being said, there are very many aspects of this ordinance that need to be revamped, Mr. President.

2838
03:53:23,155 --> 03:53:29,201
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just would like to bring up a few because I think we all are concerned about public safety.

2839
03:53:29,781 --> 03:53:35,863
[SPEAKER_02]: But we also don't want to be punitive in regards to getting something accomplished as well.

2840
03:53:37,243 --> 03:53:46,886
[SPEAKER_02]: This particular ordinance would differ from the current ordinance because right now homeowners wouldn't be responsible for clearing out pedestrian crossings.

2841
03:53:47,526 --> 03:53:57,803
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you happen to live at an intersection or if you live at a corner house, you would be responsible for shoveling the pedestrian pathway leading across the street.

2842
03:53:58,163 --> 03:54:01,248
[SPEAKER_02]: So you'd be responsible for clearing out the corner.

2843
03:54:02,233 --> 03:54:16,021
[SPEAKER_02]: Those of us who own homes and have shoveled for decades in this community realize that the city, and I hope this doesn't reflect poorly, but the city does a poor job cleaning corners up.

2844
03:54:16,782 --> 03:54:23,666
[SPEAKER_02]: And there is no snow removal, there's only snow piling on city corners and intersections.

2845
03:54:24,446 --> 03:54:36,993
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can just attest, Mr. President, moving five to six feet of packed snow from a snow plow would be an insurmountable task for residents to go through.

2846
03:54:37,433 --> 03:54:42,977
[SPEAKER_02]: And especially if you have, like we did a few years ago, snowstorm after snowstorm after snowstorm.

2847
03:54:43,417 --> 03:54:45,858
[SPEAKER_02]: So that would be the first concern I have, Mr. President.

2848
03:54:47,299 --> 03:54:52,342
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe it's important to create the connectivity for pedestrian paths.

2849
03:54:52,822 --> 03:54:59,500
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not quite sure that this alleviates that by making homeowners responsible for that, Mr. President.

2850
03:55:00,200 --> 03:55:15,833
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, this ordinance states, failure to comply within 24 hours of receiving a notice, the city may remove the snow and ice and charge the owner for the removal as a lien on the owner's property.

2851
03:55:16,514 --> 03:55:18,195
[SPEAKER_02]: That currently does not exist right now.

2852
03:55:18,716 --> 03:55:26,822
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is saying if you don't remove it within 24 hours, the city has the ability to come in and put a lien on your tax bill.

2853
03:55:27,984 --> 03:55:32,092
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure if that's legally binding, Mr. President.

2854
03:55:32,613 --> 03:55:35,739
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess when we get subcommittee, we can have that discussion.

2855
03:55:36,787 --> 03:55:40,910
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, Mr. President, it doesn't state at what expense.

2856
03:55:41,831 --> 03:55:50,417
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I happen to be, just say I'm a snowbird and I'm in Florida for three or four days, and I realize that's my property and I'm responsible.

2857
03:55:50,917 --> 03:55:57,402
[SPEAKER_02]: But if I don't attend to a particular storm, Mr. President, the city may hire someone.

2858
03:55:58,182 --> 03:55:59,844
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no set fee in this.

2859
03:56:00,982 --> 03:56:04,924
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can bet your bottom dollar the city doesn't have the resources to go out and shovel.

2860
03:56:05,464 --> 03:56:07,104
[SPEAKER_02]: So they would be hiring someone.

2861
03:56:07,565 --> 03:56:17,868
[SPEAKER_02]: That could be at a great expense to residents, to hire someone for $300, $400, $500 to shovel, depending on the amount and so forth, and to put sand and salt down.

2862
03:56:18,369 --> 03:56:24,091
[SPEAKER_02]: So this doesn't make any mention about the cost to homeowners if the city does opt

2863
03:56:24,591 --> 03:56:26,732
[SPEAKER_02]: to go out at their homeowner's expense.

2864
03:56:27,173 --> 03:56:36,859
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a concern I have, Mr. President, because I'm very mindful regarding people in our community, in particular seniors that are struggling on fixed incomes.

2865
03:56:37,480 --> 03:56:43,904
[SPEAKER_02]: And every little increase, Mr. President, as we know, is a matter of if someone can stay in their home or not.

2866
03:56:44,484 --> 03:56:50,688
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would hate to create an ordinance that may put someone in jeopardy of losing their home, Mr. President.

2867
03:56:52,510 --> 03:56:53,931
[SPEAKER_02]: The escalating fines.

2868
03:56:55,191 --> 03:56:57,892
[SPEAKER_02]: The current ordinance doesn't call for escalating fines.

2869
03:56:58,572 --> 03:57:03,313
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first offense for noncompliance is a $50 a day fine.

2870
03:57:04,573 --> 03:57:16,236
[SPEAKER_02]: And then for each subsequent offense, within 12 months, so that covers the full snow time, within 12 months, the fine or charge shall double.

2871
03:57:17,236 --> 03:57:20,157
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not in the existing ordinance to double fines.

2872
03:57:21,311 --> 03:57:22,572
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's take an example.

2873
03:57:23,112 --> 03:57:32,557
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's look at the first offense, $50 a day, you go out there and shovel immediately so you only get charged for one day.

2874
03:57:33,598 --> 03:57:42,062
[SPEAKER_02]: The second time it happens, which could be the next day, the following day, the following week within a snow period, who knows, Mr. President.

2875
03:57:42,863 --> 03:57:45,404
[SPEAKER_02]: That fine then goes, if you don't shovel, to $100 a day.

2876
03:57:48,826 --> 03:57:52,007
[SPEAKER_02]: Say you're that unfortunate that it happened to you three times.

2877
03:57:52,247 --> 03:57:54,248
[SPEAKER_02]: Just say you were in the hospital, Mr. President.

2878
03:57:54,908 --> 03:57:59,990
[SPEAKER_02]: And the third time, the fine is $200 a day for homeowners.

2879
03:58:00,910 --> 03:58:08,613
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you were really unfortunate, the next subsequent fine would be $400 a day.

2880
03:58:09,133 --> 03:58:16,736
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you didn't get out there for five days, the homeowner would get a $2,000 bill, according to this ordinance, because they didn't shovel.

2881
03:58:18,464 --> 03:58:18,964
[SPEAKER_02]: Excessive?

2882
03:58:19,624 --> 03:58:20,925
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say so, Mr. President.

2883
03:58:22,085 --> 03:58:28,506
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's another concern I have with these subsequent offenses and the doubling of fines, Mr. President.

2884
03:58:28,846 --> 03:58:38,248
[SPEAKER_02]: We all want to keep our sidewalks clear, but I think there's a way to do it, Mr. President, when we're not putting a stranglehold on residents.

2885
03:58:39,988 --> 03:58:46,850
[SPEAKER_02]: There are no provisions, as Councilor Bears mentioned, to, and I'm glad he did, to assist seniors or disabled.

2886
03:58:48,806 --> 03:58:50,467
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a senior mother that lives alone.

2887
03:58:51,648 --> 03:59:03,114
[SPEAKER_02]: I can tell you firsthand, Mr. President, over the last several years, and I try to be a good son, but I can't get out there all the time, it is next to impossible to find someone to come out and shovel.

2888
03:59:03,914 --> 03:59:10,878
[SPEAKER_02]: The days of people like we used to do when we were younger, going out, knocking the door, you don't find that anymore, Mr. President.

2889
03:59:11,038 --> 03:59:12,739
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't happen, Mr. President.

2890
03:59:13,639 --> 03:59:15,500
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not as readily available.

2891
03:59:15,540 --> 03:59:23,623
[SPEAKER_02]: I know the senior center has a list of people, and I tapped into that list, and it just wasn't consistent enough, to be quite frank with you.

2892
03:59:24,063 --> 03:59:27,884
[SPEAKER_02]: It was great they offered, but it wasn't enough in the case for my mother.

2893
03:59:28,245 --> 03:59:36,908
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know there's a lot of my mothers out there in this community, and there's a lot of disabled people, Mr. President, that would have to rely on this as well.

2894
03:59:38,220 --> 03:59:46,035
[SPEAKER_02]: The ordinance also states, and this is both ordinances, the old and the new, whenever snow or ice accumulates on the sidewalk.

2895
03:59:47,205 --> 03:59:49,126
[SPEAKER_02]: No mention the amount of ice.

2896
03:59:49,926 --> 03:59:53,387
[SPEAKER_02]: How many times, Mr. President, do you look outside and say, is that an inch?

2897
03:59:53,427 --> 03:59:54,327
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that a half an inch?

2898
03:59:54,367 --> 03:59:56,408
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I need to go out there and shovel?

2899
03:59:56,628 --> 03:59:57,688
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I not need to shovel?

2900
03:59:57,968 --> 03:59:59,229
[SPEAKER_02]: How many times does that happen?

2901
03:59:59,589 --> 04:00:00,329
[SPEAKER_02]: Should I put down ice?

2902
04:00:00,349 --> 04:00:00,709
[SPEAKER_02]: Should I not?

2903
04:00:01,069 --> 04:00:02,130
[SPEAKER_02]: How many times does that happen?

2904
04:00:02,450 --> 04:00:04,030
[SPEAKER_02]: No mention at all, Mr. President.

2905
04:00:04,450 --> 04:00:10,032
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's very possible you could be debating with your wife whether you should be out there shoveling or not.

2906
04:00:11,237 --> 04:00:18,462
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no mention what the accumulation is, and the city defines it as, you know what, we believe you should have shoveled.

2907
04:00:18,943 --> 04:00:23,926
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't say one inch, two inch, three inch, like I believe it should say, Mr. President.

2908
04:00:24,427 --> 04:00:26,768
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you may get a fine based on that.

2909
04:00:27,429 --> 04:00:31,432
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's another issue in here, Mr. President, that needs to be addressed.

2910
04:00:37,011 --> 04:00:41,035
[SPEAKER_02]: About a year ago, Mr. President, I asked the previous administration.

2911
04:00:41,775 --> 04:00:43,497
[SPEAKER_02]: I did a lot of research into this.

2912
04:00:44,298 --> 04:00:54,467
[SPEAKER_02]: And other states, I didn't find many communities around here, but I'm sure it's done, create what they call a priority street sidewalk listing.

2913
04:00:55,950 --> 04:01:00,414
[SPEAKER_02]: And they put funds aside, and many of them have to hire private contractors.

2914
04:01:01,114 --> 04:01:05,078
[SPEAKER_02]: But they put funds aside for every snowstorm greater than three inches.

2915
04:01:05,838 --> 04:01:14,926
[SPEAKER_02]: The city sits down with the DPW and residents and stakeholders and say, this is our ten miles of priority sidewalk in the community.

2916
04:01:15,827 --> 04:01:18,169
[SPEAKER_02]: And most of the time, it's the major federal fears.

2917
04:01:18,689 --> 04:01:22,592
[SPEAKER_02]: And what that does is create a connection, a linkage,

2918
04:01:23,493 --> 04:01:24,955
[SPEAKER_02]: In the community, Mr. President.

2919
04:01:25,335 --> 04:01:31,303
[SPEAKER_02]: So you would go down High Street would be done, Main Street would be done, Salem Street would be done, Fulton Street would be done.

2920
04:01:32,064 --> 04:01:33,105
[SPEAKER_02]: All riverside out.

2921
04:01:33,626 --> 04:01:38,612
[SPEAKER_02]: The major areas, Mr. President, I throw ten miles out there because that's probably reasonable.

2922
04:01:38,992 --> 04:01:40,494
[SPEAKER_02]: It may take more, it may take less.

2923
04:01:41,195 --> 04:01:44,396
[SPEAKER_02]: But I asked the administration back a year ago to look at that.

2924
04:01:44,736 --> 04:01:52,639
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if we really want to provide safety in this community, for kids that are walking to school, right now there may not be many kids walking to school.

2925
04:01:53,019 --> 04:02:09,005
[SPEAKER_02]: But for seniors, for people with disabilities, for anyone in general, Mr. President, what better to know and be reassured that every fall of snow that's greater than a certain amount, whether it's two or three inches, that those priority sidewalks will be done by a bombardier.

2926
04:02:10,103 --> 04:02:16,408
[SPEAKER_02]: And if the city can't handle it, which I don't think we have the ability to right now, we would subcontract for it, Mr. President.

2927
04:02:16,848 --> 04:02:20,551
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the figures I looked at in some communities were upwards of $160,000, $170,000.

2928
04:02:20,671 --> 04:02:38,505
[SPEAKER_02]: But if we're going to prioritize the importance, Mr. President, of doing the shoveling, opening up our sidewalks, making sure they're safe, making sure people don't walk in the streets, that's a small price to pay, Mr. President.

2929
04:02:38,965 --> 04:02:44,770
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would ask that in the form of a motion once again, because it fell on deaf ears in the last administration.

2930
04:02:45,130 --> 04:02:46,151
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great concept.

2931
04:02:46,531 --> 04:02:47,392
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't create this.

2932
04:02:48,152 --> 04:02:51,615
[SPEAKER_02]: This is being done in a lot of communities around the country.

2933
04:02:53,336 --> 04:03:05,086
[SPEAKER_02]: The second thing, Mr. President, would be on the lines of Councilor Bears, to have more of a full-fledged program where we deal with seniors and people with disability.

2934
04:03:06,465 --> 04:03:09,631
[SPEAKER_02]: That way, Mr. President, we're not leaving this up to chance.

2935
04:03:10,353 --> 04:03:12,858
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not leaving it up to whether or not someone can afford it.

2936
04:03:13,179 --> 04:03:16,024
[SPEAKER_02]: Because this is an affordability issue too, Mr. President.

2937
04:03:18,467 --> 04:03:28,752
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would ask in the form of a motion that the city also create, and I'm not sure if we could do it by ordinance or policy, create a program where we assist.

2938
04:03:28,872 --> 04:03:39,417
[SPEAKER_02]: If we're going to implement ordinances that create escalating fines and doubling fines and shoving corners and so forth, that we assist the neediest in our community.

2939
04:03:40,273 --> 04:03:43,474
[SPEAKER_02]: which are the seniors in our disabled population.

2940
04:03:44,314 --> 04:03:57,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, Mr. President, I would also ask that if we're going to make it the responsibility of residents to clean corners, clean hydrants out, the fire department has a great program.

2941
04:03:58,157 --> 04:04:05,239
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a volunteer program, if you go on the firefighters website, where they go on and ask if people want to assist in clearing out hydrants.

2942
04:04:06,147 --> 04:04:08,909
[SPEAKER_02]: And the firefighters do a tremendous job, let me tell you.

2943
04:04:09,209 --> 04:04:11,811
[SPEAKER_02]: They're out there in every snowstorm cleaning out hydrants.

2944
04:04:12,131 --> 04:04:14,673
[SPEAKER_02]: This ordinance requires residents to do it.

2945
04:04:15,354 --> 04:04:17,095
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not opposed to that, Mr. President.

2946
04:04:17,395 --> 04:04:22,819
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I'm saying is, if we're going to require residents now to be responsible for a public sidewalk,

2947
04:04:23,800 --> 04:04:26,621
[SPEAKER_02]: A public sidewalk, you don't own that sidewalk.

2948
04:04:26,901 --> 04:04:29,422
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't do any alterations to that sidewalk.

2949
04:04:29,743 --> 04:04:34,384
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we're requesting that you keep it a certain distance wide open.

2950
04:04:34,685 --> 04:04:38,586
[SPEAKER_02]: We're requesting during certain hours of daylight that you have to shovel.

2951
04:04:38,886 --> 04:04:39,827
[SPEAKER_02]: If not, you get fined.

2952
04:04:40,227 --> 04:04:51,852
[SPEAKER_02]: I think at the very least, Mr. President, the city should have some responsibility for cutting away snow at intersections and corners of streets where they intersect.

2953
04:04:52,694 --> 04:05:02,259
[SPEAKER_02]: The complaints I receive constantly, more than complaints of someone just not shoveling, are the ability for people to cross from street to street.

2954
04:05:02,699 --> 04:05:05,020
[SPEAKER_02]: That seems to be the major concern.

2955
04:05:05,640 --> 04:05:12,283
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have to create some systematic approach in the community where we don't just pile, we remove.

2956
04:05:12,964 --> 04:05:15,445
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's going to be a large endeavor with seven square miles.

2957
04:05:15,725 --> 04:05:16,866
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a big city, this.

2958
04:05:17,266 --> 04:05:19,207
[SPEAKER_02]: I would venture to say thousands of corners.

2959
04:05:21,067 --> 04:05:33,058
[SPEAKER_02]: But we have to have a better way of addressing this than saying, sorry homeowner, you're responsible for every pedestrian crossing and every intersection of streets and every corner.

2960
04:05:33,318 --> 04:05:34,799
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you're responsible.

2961
04:05:36,040 --> 04:05:37,281
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds good in theory?

2962
04:05:38,062 --> 04:05:39,563
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't work, Mr. President.

2963
04:05:39,583 --> 04:05:42,066
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we truly want to put something together,

2964
04:05:43,820 --> 04:05:48,201
[SPEAKER_02]: that addresses the issue, those are the discussions we have to have.

2965
04:05:48,802 --> 04:05:50,402
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm willing to have them, Mr. President.

2966
04:05:50,702 --> 04:05:54,624
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the fact that this makes homeowners responsible and not tenants.

2967
04:05:55,004 --> 04:06:00,386
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree, chasing after a tenant, many days now you have two, three, four, five people living in there.

2968
04:06:00,786 --> 04:06:02,406
[SPEAKER_02]: No one's going to claim responsibility.

2969
04:06:02,686 --> 04:06:04,127
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all paying a certain amount.

2970
04:06:05,007 --> 04:06:06,188
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be a nightmare.

2971
04:06:06,468 --> 04:06:08,948
[SPEAKER_02]: So I agree with aspects of this, Mr. President.

2972
04:06:09,429 --> 04:06:12,930
[SPEAKER_02]: But I also want to make sure we put something that makes sense.

2973
04:06:13,550 --> 04:06:17,012
[SPEAKER_02]: And something that's not punitive, Mr. President, to homeowners.

2974
04:06:17,473 --> 04:06:20,094
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of this in here, I believe, is punitive.

2975
04:06:20,635 --> 04:06:39,547
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we can address it, but I want to make sure, whatever discussions I had, that these three items, and I offer them in the form of a motion, that the city expand, the last one, the city expand their plowing to include snow and ice removal on all pedestrian crossings along with corners and intersections.

2976
04:06:40,828 --> 04:06:42,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2977
04:06:42,189 --> 04:06:43,069
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2978
04:06:43,089 --> 04:06:43,269
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

2979
04:06:43,289 --> 04:06:44,950
[SPEAKER_04]: Clerk, are there any gender wording on those motions?

2980
04:06:45,231 --> 04:06:45,871
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll second that.

2981
04:06:47,732 --> 04:06:48,973
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. President, hang on a second.

2982
04:06:49,233 --> 04:06:49,353
[SPEAKER_22]: OK.

2983
04:06:51,294 --> 04:06:51,534
[SPEAKER_09]: John.

2984
04:06:52,014 --> 04:06:52,535
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, Sam.

2985
04:06:52,555 --> 04:06:59,119
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I have two of Councilor Marks' three amendments, but I'm trying to.

2986
04:06:59,139 --> 04:07:02,180
[SPEAKER_09]: The second one I have is that there needs to be discussion of more

2987
04:07:12,865 --> 04:07:14,466
[SPEAKER_22]: to assist the neediest in our community.

2988
04:07:15,426 --> 04:07:16,947
[SPEAKER_02]: With shoveling services, correct.

2989
04:07:17,247 --> 04:07:18,267
[SPEAKER_22]: With shoveling services.

2990
04:07:21,048 --> 04:07:33,313
[SPEAKER_22]: The third one is to request the city expand plowing to include snow and ice removal on all intersections and crosswalks.

2991
04:07:33,413 --> 04:07:36,694
[SPEAKER_02]: All pedestrian crossings, corners, and intersections, correct.

2992
04:07:38,394 --> 04:07:39,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay?

2993
04:07:39,534 --> 04:07:41,875
[SPEAKER_22]: I need some help with the first one.

2994
04:07:42,035 --> 04:07:53,777
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, so the first one would be the city create a priority sidewalks listing of responsible sidewalks for plowing.

2995
04:07:56,118 --> 04:08:01,319
[SPEAKER_02]: And I put of snow greater than three inches, but that could be up for deliberation.

2996
04:08:01,439 --> 04:08:02,939
[SPEAKER_02]: That was just for discussion purpose.

2997
04:08:04,210 --> 04:08:14,955
[SPEAKER_02]: So the city create a priority sidewalk listing where they shovel, plow all the major sidewalk, dental affairs.

2998
04:08:17,316 --> 04:08:17,616
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

2999
04:08:18,577 --> 04:08:19,437
[SPEAKER_02]: Within the community.

3000
04:08:19,457 --> 04:08:20,277
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

3001
04:08:20,818 --> 04:08:24,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilman Marks, do you want these as amendments to the main paper or B paper?

3002
04:08:25,260 --> 04:08:26,380
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter, whatever.

3003
04:08:26,720 --> 04:08:27,981
[SPEAKER_25]: Happy to take them as amendments.

3004
04:08:28,701 --> 04:08:29,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Amendments, okay.

3005
04:08:29,342 --> 04:08:29,982
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

3006
04:08:30,424 --> 04:08:31,106
[SPEAKER_25]: That's fine with me.

3007
04:08:31,987 --> 04:08:34,172
[SPEAKER_25]: Mr. Mr. President, I just can't.

3008
04:08:34,994 --> 04:08:36,076
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so that's a mark.

3009
04:08:36,096 --> 04:08:36,557
[SPEAKER_04]: You're all set.

3010
04:08:37,138 --> 04:08:37,339
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

3011
04:08:37,379 --> 04:08:38,140
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

3012
04:08:39,361 --> 04:08:41,922
[SPEAKER_09]: Real quick, I know I appreciate Councilor Bears bringing this forward.

3013
04:08:42,342 --> 04:08:46,004
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's important that we do something, especially before the first snow falls.

3014
04:08:46,044 --> 04:08:50,105
[SPEAKER_09]: But Councilor Marksby, I think we all bring up good points and I appreciate it.

3015
04:08:50,866 --> 04:08:54,567
[SPEAKER_09]: If we could, it's ironic that my neighbor knocked on my door today.

3016
04:08:55,207 --> 04:09:00,950
[SPEAKER_09]: And something if we can add that we didn't realize until about seven months ago, the importance of our first responders.

3017
04:09:02,670 --> 04:09:03,771
[SPEAKER_09]: She was frantic thinking.

3018
04:09:04,691 --> 04:09:09,315
[SPEAKER_09]: If this is the way of the world, she might be gone four days out of a week.

3019
04:09:10,155 --> 04:09:13,058
[SPEAKER_09]: And if that happens during a snowstorm, she could be penalized for this.

3020
04:09:13,478 --> 04:09:23,306
[SPEAKER_09]: So as you go through the subcommittee, I know I'm not on it, but just point of discussion is really look at that as an option too, because I know it's tough.

3021
04:09:24,498 --> 04:09:30,000
[SPEAKER_09]: to distinguish what homeowners are first responders, but I think they'll be negatively impacted with this too.

3022
04:09:30,060 --> 04:09:32,320
[SPEAKER_09]: So not to say we don't need it.

3023
04:09:32,440 --> 04:09:34,361
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that other communities have great programs.

3024
04:09:34,921 --> 04:09:42,883
[SPEAKER_09]: I know the community that I work for, they have four sidewalk trucks and they send those out, like Councilman Mark said, all throughout the city.

3025
04:09:43,303 --> 04:09:47,745
[SPEAKER_09]: And they open up every main thoroughway and every park and every school and

3026
04:09:50,393 --> 04:09:58,238
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to have to put our money where our mouth is again, and give our DPW the tools to put this to fruition.

3027
04:09:58,278 --> 04:10:03,361
[SPEAKER_09]: Because again, it is the safety of our pedestrians that we're asking for.

3028
04:10:03,481 --> 04:10:04,321
[SPEAKER_09]: So, thank you.

3029
04:10:05,162 --> 04:10:06,343
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Consul Scarpelli.

3030
04:10:07,323 --> 04:10:07,964
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President.

3031
04:10:09,024 --> 04:10:10,065
[SPEAKER_04]: Consulate bears.

3032
04:10:10,405 --> 04:10:11,626
[SPEAKER_25]: I think the clerk can go first.

3033
04:10:17,641 --> 04:10:18,882
[SPEAKER_09]: No, just be discussed.

3034
04:10:18,902 --> 04:10:25,548
[SPEAKER_09]: I trust my colleagues to make that a point.

3035
04:10:25,868 --> 04:10:26,709
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Mr. President.

3036
04:10:26,729 --> 04:10:27,490
[SPEAKER_25]: I won't belabor this.

3037
04:10:27,550 --> 04:10:32,714
[SPEAKER_25]: I want to say that I agree with basically everything Councilor Mark said and Councilor Scarpelli said.

3038
04:10:32,734 --> 04:10:40,801
[SPEAKER_25]: I took the last language that I could find that had gone to the Public Works Subcommittee previously and put it forward.

3039
04:10:40,882 --> 04:10:41,142
[SPEAKER_25]: I think

3040
04:10:41,742 --> 04:10:42,722
[SPEAKER_25]: You're absolutely right.

3041
04:10:43,923 --> 04:10:48,424
[SPEAKER_25]: When I read it, I didn't think it'd be $2,000, but obviously that's not a fine that would be acceptable.

3042
04:10:48,684 --> 04:11:00,949
[SPEAKER_25]: So I think a lot of the points that were brought up by me and Council Marks and Councilors Scarpelli will be discussed in the subcommittee and hopefully we can get to a good answer and make a program that works for everybody.

3043
04:11:01,169 --> 04:11:01,449
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

3044
04:11:01,789 --> 04:11:04,410
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, we have a couple of people that want to speak.

3045
04:11:05,310 --> 04:11:05,890
[SPEAKER_04]: God's all night.

3046
04:11:06,550 --> 04:11:07,910
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't see your hand.

3047
04:11:07,970 --> 04:11:08,611
[SPEAKER_04]: I apologize.

3048
04:11:09,651 --> 04:11:16,132
[SPEAKER_27]: Mr. President, the snow and ice account is the only account that we can run a deficit in here in the city of Medford and across the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

3049
04:11:16,472 --> 04:11:27,895
[SPEAKER_27]: We heard Marsha this morning, it feels like this morning, earlier in the evening when we were talking about the Lawrence Mural Hospital and she gave us a figure of 20% of the community residents are senior citizens.

3050
04:11:28,155 --> 04:11:29,015
[SPEAKER_27]: I know, I just realized.

3051
04:11:29,435 --> 04:11:31,517
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm maybe a little high, but close.

3052
04:11:32,618 --> 04:11:37,262
[SPEAKER_27]: You know, the city in the past has had a practice of removing the snow in our business districts.

3053
04:11:37,282 --> 04:11:43,208
[SPEAKER_27]: We've had a bombardier that's gone down the street and down the sidewalks and removed the snow in front of St.

3054
04:11:43,228 --> 04:11:44,929
[SPEAKER_27]: Joseph's all the way down into Medford Square.

3055
04:11:44,949 --> 04:11:45,890
[SPEAKER_27]: And that's a practice that we've

3056
04:11:47,111 --> 04:11:57,214
[SPEAKER_27]: Had in the past, and it's a practice that should continue, when we look at the Department of Conservation and Recreation and we see the roadways that are under their control, they have a bombardier that comes out and clears their sidewalks.

3057
04:11:57,314 --> 04:12:03,515
[SPEAKER_27]: The Department of Conservation and Recreation, a state agency, Mr. President, goes out and does all of their property.

3058
04:12:04,255 --> 04:12:14,918
[SPEAKER_27]: I see no reason why the city of Medford should take steps to hold their citizens to a higher standard than that of their DPW and the contractors that they're hiring to pave the streets.

3059
04:12:16,619 --> 04:12:25,428
[SPEAKER_27]: We can either pass an ordinance that's going to require the citizens to perform the DPW's job, or we can focus on the delivery of services here in the community for the residents and the taxpayers.

3060
04:12:25,448 --> 04:12:29,252
[SPEAKER_27]: And the way that we do that is by investing in our DPW, Mr. President.

3061
04:12:29,272 --> 04:12:32,035
[SPEAKER_27]: And that's an area that we've historically not invested in.

3062
04:12:32,435 --> 04:12:35,138
[SPEAKER_27]: We say, buy this piece of equipment because you're not going to have the manpower.

3063
04:12:35,378 --> 04:12:38,542
[SPEAKER_27]: We're getting to the point now, Mr. President, where we've got more pieces of equipment than we do people.

3064
04:12:39,162 --> 04:12:45,768
[SPEAKER_27]: All right, so we're not going to be able to get anything done if we don't look at what's going on, reallocate funds, and refocus what our priorities are.

3065
04:12:46,129 --> 04:12:50,933
[SPEAKER_27]: Because our DPW is failing right now, and they're failing because of one reason, manpower.

3066
04:12:51,533 --> 04:12:54,316
[SPEAKER_27]: Manpower, Mr. President, manpower.

3067
04:12:54,356 --> 04:13:01,222
[SPEAKER_27]: We can have over 100 police officers, over 100 firefighters, but not even 50% of that is part of our DPW?

3068
04:13:03,100 --> 04:13:11,347
[SPEAKER_27]: That's a problem, Mr. President, and I don't think that penalizing residents and homeowners because we're making poor decisions in terms of how we allocate funds is going to be the answer.

3069
04:13:11,987 --> 04:13:18,453
[SPEAKER_27]: So moving forward, Mr. President, I think it's very important that we look at the reasoning behind why fines for commercial properties have doubled.

3070
04:13:19,413 --> 04:13:27,260
[SPEAKER_27]: When we look at commercial properties, they pay a higher tax rate than residential properties here in the community, as do industrial properties, because we have a bifurcated tax rate.

3071
04:13:27,621 --> 04:13:31,684
[SPEAKER_27]: And we have that tax rate for a reason, to keep residential property taxes low.

3072
04:13:32,065 --> 04:13:34,207
[SPEAKER_27]: But at the same time, snow removal, snow removal.

3073
04:13:34,347 --> 04:13:42,054
[SPEAKER_27]: Why are we punishing a commercial property owner double what we'd be punishing a industrial property owner or a residential property owner?

3074
04:13:42,654 --> 04:13:53,661
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't understand what the importance of singling out a commercial property for double fines is, when the commercial properties are the ones that actually bring jobs to this community.

3075
04:13:54,281 --> 04:14:03,847
[SPEAKER_27]: They actually allow people to go to work, who live in Medford, can work in Medford, can play in Medford, can spend their ancillary money in the circular floor of our local economy, Mr. President.

3076
04:14:03,867 --> 04:14:09,231
[SPEAKER_27]: So I think it's very important we recognize the role that commercial properties play in our community, and we shouldn't be singling them out.

3077
04:14:10,331 --> 04:14:15,012
[SPEAKER_27]: Every time we talk about zoning, we talk about the fact that we're losing commercial properties left and right.

3078
04:14:15,032 --> 04:14:20,614
[SPEAKER_27]: We're down to 7 or 8% of the total number of parcels in our community is going to be commercial industrial.

3079
04:14:21,094 --> 04:14:29,676
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, if we keep doing stuff like this and penalizing properties for being commercial when instances arise, then we're going to be in a situation where we're going to see less and less of that, Mr. President.

3080
04:14:29,976 --> 04:14:32,497
[SPEAKER_27]: So I think that the fine should be uniform and across the board.

3081
04:14:32,517 --> 04:14:34,117
[SPEAKER_27]: It shouldn't matter what type of parcel you own.

3082
04:14:36,670 --> 04:14:37,531
[SPEAKER_27]: The fines should be the same.

3083
04:14:38,251 --> 04:14:53,685
[SPEAKER_27]: That coupled with the fact that I really feel as though we should be investing our efforts and our energies in delivering services as a city and as a community, in addressing some of the issues that Councilor Marks brought up about prioritizing our sidewalks and our roadways and ensuring connectivity.

3084
04:14:54,386 --> 04:14:59,849
[SPEAKER_27]: But at the same time, not doing it in a punitive fashion so that our residents are being penalized.

3085
04:15:00,630 --> 04:15:06,033
[SPEAKER_27]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I do think this needs a lot of work, and the paper remains in the subcommittee.

3086
04:15:06,093 --> 04:15:10,916
[SPEAKER_27]: So we could take a vote on this, or we could just say call the subcommittee.

3087
04:15:10,956 --> 04:15:12,897
[SPEAKER_27]: I mean, the paper's in the subcommittee already from last term.

3088
04:15:13,237 --> 04:15:19,521
[SPEAKER_27]: It is what it is, but I'd move for approval on the paper and the amendments, and I'd like to ask that they be consolidated so that we can vote once.

3089
04:15:21,624 --> 04:15:24,525
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a point of information, what subcommittee is that, Mr. President?

3090
04:15:24,585 --> 04:15:27,286
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Confederate of Santa Clara Public Works.

3091
04:15:28,006 --> 04:15:29,367
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have one in public safety?

3092
04:15:29,387 --> 04:15:32,228
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't know if there's one in public works or public safety.

3093
04:15:32,288 --> 04:15:33,528
[SPEAKER_27]: It was in public works.

3094
04:15:34,249 --> 04:15:35,129
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in public works?

3095
04:15:36,229 --> 04:15:49,344
[SPEAKER_27]: If this is really a priority, Mr. President, last week we asked the city clerk to post three meetings, second Tuesday in October, November, and December, for the purpose of the city solicitor appearing before us to talk about ordinances in the ordinance subcommittee.

3096
04:15:49,364 --> 04:15:51,707
[SPEAKER_27]: This is an ordinance, this is also a venue that we could take it up in.

3097
04:15:52,067 --> 04:15:55,511
[SPEAKER_27]: I know Councilor Beals wants to maintain control of it, so he probably wants it in the committee that he chairs.

3098
04:15:55,851 --> 04:15:58,114
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't want to speak for him, but you know what I mean, it is what it is.

3099
04:15:58,594 --> 04:16:02,899
[SPEAKER_27]: So either way is fine with me, Mr. President, but those meetings are already going to be posted.

3100
04:16:02,939 --> 04:16:04,521
[SPEAKER_27]: The clerk's already been directed to do such.

3101
04:16:04,601 --> 04:16:08,845
[SPEAKER_27]: So if we want to talk about existing ordinances, then that's a committee that can be referred to as well.

3102
04:16:09,065 --> 04:16:11,148
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have full body of the membership too.

3103
04:16:12,898 --> 04:16:13,639
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe worthwhile.

3104
04:16:17,142 --> 04:16:19,265
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't have a horse in the game, Mr. President, one way or the other.

3105
04:16:19,985 --> 04:16:24,089
[SPEAKER_27]: It's going to have to go to a committee of the whole before it comes to the council floor, pursuant to council rules anyway.

3106
04:16:24,149 --> 04:16:24,770
[SPEAKER_04]: You are correct.

3107
04:16:25,070 --> 04:16:27,253
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a number of residents that want to speak on this.

3108
04:16:27,333 --> 04:16:31,457
[SPEAKER_04]: So at this time, I recognize Martha Andres.

3109
04:16:32,998 --> 04:16:34,200
[SPEAKER_04]: Name and address for the record, please.

3110
04:16:35,847 --> 04:16:37,849
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening.

3111
04:16:38,149 --> 04:16:46,554
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a resident at 45 Kilgore Avenue in Medford, and I'd like to speak on this on behalf of this ordinance.

3112
04:16:46,654 --> 04:16:49,435
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Councilor, for considering it.

3113
04:16:50,216 --> 04:17:03,824
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a long time, as Councilor Knight pointed out, WAC Medford and others have been asking for this ordinance for well over a year, and it's sat in subcommittee for some reason.

3114
04:17:04,833 --> 04:17:11,675
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the idea of, you know, this is intended to help all of us and to be a two-way street.

3115
04:17:11,795 --> 04:17:25,459
[SPEAKER_01]: It gives the city, the ordinance gives the city the opportunity to impose a fine if someone isn't cooperating with their neighbors and they're the only house on the block that doesn't shovel.

3116
04:17:25,559 --> 04:17:27,620
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I have neighbors like that.

3117
04:17:28,620 --> 04:17:32,742
[SPEAKER_01]: Strangely, their own driveways and walks get shoveled and the sidewalk never does.

3118
04:17:34,787 --> 04:17:36,589
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very important thing.

3119
04:17:36,649 --> 04:17:46,136
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen people, elderly people, people with small children walking to school who have to go out into the street because there's a piece of the sidewalk that's not plowed.

3120
04:17:46,897 --> 04:17:54,883
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's worrisome to see when you know that the cars are on slippery roads narrowed by snow banks to begin with.

3121
04:17:55,955 --> 04:18:05,398
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a wonderful idea to combine this with additional resources to the DPW for those areas that homeowners shouldn't be asked to handle.

3122
04:18:06,698 --> 04:18:14,180
[SPEAKER_01]: But I encourage you all to get this job done before our winter season starts.

3123
04:18:14,300 --> 04:18:15,180
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.

3124
04:18:15,300 --> 04:18:15,740
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

3125
04:18:15,760 --> 04:18:19,701
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, Jeff Boxbaum.

3126
04:18:21,142 --> 04:18:22,342
[SPEAKER_04]: Name and address for the record, please.

3127
04:18:23,169 --> 04:18:25,371
[SPEAKER_19]: Jeff Buxbaum, 31 Hill Park.

3128
04:18:26,372 --> 04:18:28,674
[SPEAKER_27]: Point of information, Mr. President, just before we start.

3129
04:18:28,954 --> 04:18:30,596
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm sorry, point of information, Councilor Knight.

3130
04:18:30,756 --> 04:18:32,377
[SPEAKER_27]: It's 20 past 11 at this point in time.

3131
04:18:32,417 --> 04:18:35,540
[SPEAKER_27]: We have about 17, 18 other items left on the agenda.

3132
04:18:35,560 --> 04:18:37,422
[SPEAKER_27]: This matter is going to subcommittee to be vetted.

3133
04:18:37,462 --> 04:18:41,966
[SPEAKER_27]: It's going to go to committee of the whole to be vetted further, and then it's going to come back to the council floor.

3134
04:18:42,026 --> 04:18:42,146
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes.

3135
04:18:43,510 --> 04:18:47,313
[SPEAKER_27]: We're all going to vote in favor to send this thing to the subcommittee to be discussed.

3136
04:18:47,553 --> 04:18:50,034
[SPEAKER_27]: We've already all spoke on it, and we've already all said that.

3137
04:18:50,995 --> 04:18:58,080
[SPEAKER_27]: So with that being said, Mr. President, there'll be ample opportunity for individuals to provide public participation on the topic that's before us here.

3138
04:18:58,100 --> 04:19:03,683
[SPEAKER_27]: They're going to have a subcommittee meeting or multiple subcommittee meetings, a committee of the whole meeting, and then it's going to come back to the council floor.

3139
04:19:04,224 --> 04:19:06,385
[SPEAKER_27]: Right now, the vote we're taking is only to send it to subcommittee.

3140
04:19:06,665 --> 04:19:10,288
[SPEAKER_27]: I know there are individuals in the community that support this piece of legislation.

3141
04:19:10,988 --> 04:19:15,449
[SPEAKER_27]: But I think in the interest of time, Mr. President, it might make sense for us to say, OK, we're going to send it to subcommittee.

3142
04:19:15,469 --> 04:19:19,850
[SPEAKER_27]: The subcommittee is going to be scheduled, and the matter is going to be deliberated.

3143
04:19:20,270 --> 04:19:21,731
[SPEAKER_27]: And then it's going to go to the committee of the whole.

3144
04:19:21,771 --> 04:19:23,271
[SPEAKER_27]: It's going to be scheduled, deliberated again.

3145
04:19:23,291 --> 04:19:26,232
[SPEAKER_27]: Then it's going to be put on the council agenda, and going to move forward again.

3146
04:19:26,272 --> 04:19:28,512
[SPEAKER_27]: So everybody's going to have an ample opportunity to speak.

3147
04:19:28,532 --> 04:19:33,374
[SPEAKER_27]: We would have been done by now.

3148
04:19:33,434 --> 04:19:34,214
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do this.

3149
04:19:34,234 --> 04:19:36,254
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Boxbaum has been waiting for a while.

3150
04:19:36,274 --> 04:19:36,835
[SPEAKER_04]: He's on the call.

3151
04:19:36,875 --> 04:19:37,915
[SPEAKER_04]: If you could please continue.

3152
04:19:39,164 --> 04:19:40,585
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to talk for 20 seconds.

3153
04:19:40,605 --> 04:19:41,605
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you very much.

3154
04:19:41,645 --> 04:19:43,846
[SPEAKER_19]: We've been working.

3155
04:19:44,107 --> 04:19:47,568
[SPEAKER_19]: What method was formed in 2015 because of the snow of 2015?

3156
04:19:47,608 --> 04:19:50,190
[SPEAKER_19]: We've been working on this for years.

3157
04:19:50,810 --> 04:19:53,031
[SPEAKER_19]: We are looking forward to this going to the committee.

3158
04:19:53,471 --> 04:19:59,715
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'd just like to say it's not either something that happens in an ordinance or something that has to happen through the administration.

3159
04:20:00,155 --> 04:20:02,556
[SPEAKER_19]: You guys have to work together on this and work it out.

3160
04:20:02,596 --> 04:20:04,017
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not a trivial problem.

3161
04:20:04,517 --> 04:20:08,099
[SPEAKER_19]: And I really trust that we have a lot of smart people that can sit in a room together

3162
04:20:08,626 --> 04:20:10,087
[SPEAKER_19]: and figure out all these points.

3163
04:20:10,147 --> 04:20:12,008
[SPEAKER_19]: It's very important that we get this done.

3164
04:20:13,108 --> 04:20:22,012
[SPEAKER_19]: I understand that you're concerned about hurting homeowners that aren't around and all that, but people need to be able to walk on the sidewalk to get around.

3165
04:20:22,032 --> 04:20:27,475
[SPEAKER_19]: So our goal is to make it safe to walk in the streets, so let's make that happen.

3166
04:20:27,495 --> 04:20:28,595
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.

3167
04:20:28,635 --> 04:20:29,716
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

3168
04:20:29,736 --> 04:20:35,879
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, on the motion of Councilor Piz, seconded by Councilor Morell, as amended by Councilor Morell, and Councilor Marks.

[SPEAKER_09]: make a motion to combine, Mr. President, if we can.

3189
04:22:24,057 --> 04:22:24,398
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

3190
04:22:24,678 --> 04:22:28,779
[SPEAKER_09]: And, uh, they're all the same owner.

3191
04:22:29,159 --> 04:22:29,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

3193
04:22:30,659 --> 04:22:37,041
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli is making a motion that we combine all three of these because they are very similar in nature and it is the same person.

[SPEAKER_04]: So on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by vice president, uh, Caraviello that we combine two zero five eight four two zero five eight five and two zero five eight six.

[SPEAKER_04]: These papers are not combined.

3207
04:23:13,440 --> 04:23:18,622

[SPEAKER_04]: And let's see, in 20586 is petition for a common ventures license by David Cafu, 280 Methuen, Massachusetts, 01844.

3211
04:23:41,766 --> 04:23:47,990
[SPEAKER_04]: For Greater Boston's BJ Donuts, LLC 620 Felsway, Methuen, Massachusetts.

3212
04:23:48,990 --> 04:24:03,924
[SPEAKER_04]: And on file for all of these are the business certificates, building department, fire department, police, traffic impact, health department, letter of compliance, state tax ID, workman's compensation, petition, and treasurer's forms.

3213
04:24:03,984 --> 04:24:07,867
[SPEAKER_04]: At this point, I recognize the chairperson on licensing, Councilman Scarpelli.

3214
04:24:08,068 --> 04:24:09,589
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

3215
04:24:09,989 --> 04:24:11,410
[SPEAKER_09]: Is Mr. Kapoor president today?

3216
04:24:12,506 --> 04:24:18,751
[SPEAKER_04]: So it looks like it's Nancy La Rochelle, am I saying that correct?

3217
04:24:18,811 --> 04:24:19,792
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to unmute you.

3218
04:24:21,153 --> 04:24:22,734
[SPEAKER_04]: I know she's been waiting patiently, so.

3219
04:24:23,915 --> 04:24:26,497
[SPEAKER_04]: Nancy, name and address for the record, please.

3220
04:24:26,517 --> 04:24:33,001
[SPEAKER_23]: Nancy La Rochelle for 280 Meramec Street.

3221
04:24:33,021 --> 04:24:35,303
[SPEAKER_23]: We're doing for the Dunkin' Donuts.

3222
04:24:35,323 --> 04:24:37,685
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I apologize for the delay.

3223
04:24:40,094 --> 04:24:52,920
[SPEAKER_09]: or shall I believe, it seems like all of these petitions, everything seems in order and all the paperwork is complete, but just a simple question.

3224
04:24:53,260 --> 04:24:58,582
[SPEAKER_09]: Are all these hours of business just transferring over?

3225
04:25:00,063 --> 04:25:00,363
Yes.

3226
04:25:00,543 --> 04:25:01,463
[SPEAKER_09]: With the owner, correct?

3227
04:25:01,483 --> 04:25:02,584
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a change of ownership?

3228
04:25:04,591 --> 04:25:06,232
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so everything else stays the same.

3229
04:25:06,272 --> 04:25:12,754
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that the hours on Middlesex is 9 a.m.

3230
04:25:12,854 --> 04:25:17,937
[SPEAKER_09]: to 8 p.m., then we have Salem Street, 5 a.m.

3231
04:25:17,997 --> 04:25:22,698
[SPEAKER_09]: to 11, and then the Felsway site is open 24 hours, correct?

3232
04:25:23,759 --> 04:25:30,862
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes, except for 270 Middlesex is closed now and it's not going to reopen, so we don't need to do that one.

3233
04:25:30,882 --> 04:25:32,583
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so strike.

3234
04:25:34,798 --> 04:25:37,019
[SPEAKER_09]: Middlesex, Mr. President?

3235
04:25:37,580 --> 04:25:38,600
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a 24-0.

3236
04:25:39,181 --> 04:25:40,301
[SPEAKER_09]: No, that's the one that's 9-8.

3237
04:25:40,341 --> 04:25:43,603
[SPEAKER_04]: That is closed?

3238
04:25:44,624 --> 04:25:45,064
[SPEAKER_09]: It's closed.

3239
04:25:45,244 --> 04:25:49,346
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, I find everything in order, Mr. President.

3240
04:25:49,406 --> 04:25:50,047
[SPEAKER_09]: I move approval.

3241
04:25:52,042 --> 04:25:53,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, on the motion of- Mr. President.

3242
04:25:53,742 --> 04:25:59,124
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, the motion approved by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Vice President- If I can, I apologize.

3243
04:25:59,184 --> 04:26:02,705
[SPEAKER_09]: Before I go, I know what I forgot, I thought I had a note.

3244
04:26:03,245 --> 04:26:10,086
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that we normally, for new owners, we put just a review, especially for the 24 hours.

3245
04:26:10,146 --> 04:26:13,627
[SPEAKER_09]: If Councilor Knight can help me, is it a 60 day review?

3246
04:26:13,647 --> 04:26:15,247
[SPEAKER_09]: 90- We usually do a 30 and a 60.

3247
04:26:15,548 --> 04:26:16,908
[SPEAKER_09]: 30 and a 60 day review if we can.

3248
04:26:18,269 --> 04:26:25,295
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are the only restrictions, if we can, just to revisit as they're new owners to check their standing as we move forward.

3249
04:26:25,636 --> 04:26:26,537
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, sorry.

3250
04:26:26,557 --> 04:26:27,718
[SPEAKER_04]: So put that down as an amendment.

3251
04:26:27,878 --> 04:26:28,959
[SPEAKER_09]: Should I apologize?

3252
04:26:28,979 --> 04:26:29,520
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I'm sorry.

3253
04:26:29,720 --> 04:26:30,260
[SPEAKER_04]: No worries.

3254
04:26:30,621 --> 04:26:33,343
[SPEAKER_04]: So that will be, I'm sorry, a 30 and a 60 day review?

3255
04:26:33,644 --> 04:26:36,747
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, on the Felsway site.

3256
04:26:41,520 --> 04:26:43,021
[SPEAKER_04]: 30, 60 day review.

3257
04:26:43,061 --> 04:26:49,064
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor, so there's a motion by Councilor Scott Pelly, as amended by Councilor Scott Pelly, seconded by Vice President Caraviello.

3258
04:26:49,124 --> 04:26:49,664
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight.

3259
04:26:50,345 --> 04:26:51,405
[SPEAKER_27]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

3260
04:26:52,866 --> 04:27:03,912
[SPEAKER_27]: In review of the common practice of the council, it's always been that the special permit for extended hours would be granted to the business and not the property.

3261
04:27:04,512 --> 04:27:08,434
[SPEAKER_27]: And the business is changing hands, which would require an application for a second

3262
04:27:12,020 --> 04:27:15,241
[SPEAKER_27]: An application for a permit for extended hours, if I'm not mistaken.

3263
04:27:15,301 --> 04:27:23,362
[SPEAKER_27]: So I guess, can the city clerk clarify or confirm whether or not when this initial permit was issued, it was issued to the property or to the business?

3264
04:27:23,682 --> 04:27:30,764
[SPEAKER_27]: And if it was issued to the business, then I believe they'd be required to come back before us for extended hours permit for any operation before 7 a.m.

3265
04:27:30,784 --> 04:27:31,884
[SPEAKER_27]: or after 11 p.m., right?

3266
04:27:33,524 --> 04:27:37,205
[SPEAKER_22]: Council, I would need to do the research on the original permit, but I can do that for you.

3267
04:27:41,391 --> 04:27:51,518
[SPEAKER_27]: And I don't want to hold it up, Mr. President, so I have no problem moving for approval, provided that the clerk gives us the information that we're requesting.

3268
04:27:51,818 --> 04:28:01,565
[SPEAKER_27]: And if an extended hours permit is necessary, he contacts the business owner prior to their opening and informs them of the process that they need to go through to obtain an extended hours permit.

3269
04:28:08,750 --> 04:28:09,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you have that, Clerk Perkins?

3270
04:28:10,489 --> 04:28:11,070
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I got that.

3271
04:28:11,090 --> 04:28:11,250
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

3272
04:28:12,251 --> 04:28:23,264
[SPEAKER_04]: So on the motion of... Did you... I mean, it's not a motion, it's more that...

3273
04:28:26,952 --> 04:28:28,053
[SPEAKER_27]: It's an operation of government.

3274
04:28:28,093 --> 04:28:34,135
[SPEAKER_27]: I mean, if the permit was issued, what they're asking for right now, they can't get if they're not grandfathered in.

3275
04:28:34,695 --> 04:28:35,936
[SPEAKER_27]: If they are grandfathered in, they can get it.

3276
04:28:36,216 --> 04:28:40,638
[SPEAKER_09]: So I guess what I'm saying is- Just an information point to the petitioner.

3277
04:28:40,938 --> 04:28:43,019
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, let's confirm what's going on.

3278
04:28:43,039 --> 04:28:43,920
[SPEAKER_27]: We'll move for approval.

3279
04:28:44,320 --> 04:28:50,582
[SPEAKER_27]: The license is going to be, I'm under the impression it's going to be 7 to 11, unless otherwise with the restrictions.

3280
04:28:50,622 --> 04:28:53,284
[SPEAKER_27]: And if not, then the clerk will notify them and have them come back before us.

3281
04:28:54,924 --> 04:28:56,045
[SPEAKER_09]: Does the petitioner understand that?

3282
04:29:00,339 --> 04:29:00,919
[SPEAKER_04]: Ms.

3283
04:29:00,939 --> 04:29:02,320
[SPEAKER_04]: LaRochelle, do you understand that?

3284
04:29:03,420 --> 04:29:03,680
Yes.

3285
04:29:03,920 --> 04:29:05,060
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, perfect.

3286
04:29:05,840 --> 04:29:09,021
[SPEAKER_04]: So on the motion of- Mr. President, can I interrupt for a second?

3287
04:29:09,261 --> 04:29:09,801
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, you can.

3288
04:29:10,641 --> 04:29:15,622
[SPEAKER_22]: So is the council voting tonight on 278 Middlesex Avenue or not?

3289
04:29:15,642 --> 04:29:17,742
[SPEAKER_22]: Because I heard that it was closed and not reopening.

3290
04:29:17,762 --> 04:29:20,183
[SPEAKER_22]: So is that request been withdrawn?

3291
04:29:20,203 --> 04:29:21,143
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, that's withdrawn.

3292
04:29:21,163 --> 04:29:22,123
[SPEAKER_22]: So we're going to strike 20584.

3293
04:29:28,930 --> 04:29:33,512
[SPEAKER_27]: Along with the review, Mr. President, I'd like to ask that the permit go with the business entity and not the address.

3294
04:29:34,652 --> 04:29:52,678
[SPEAKER_27]: If in fact we need to address the extended hours permit going forward, whether or not there's a way that we can put a mechanism in place so that it now goes with the business and doesn't stay with the process, whether that requires a rescinding of a vote, previous vote or not, but to protect the neighborhood.

3295
04:29:57,315 --> 04:29:58,516
[SPEAKER_04]: Clerk Herves, let me know when you're ready.

3296
04:29:58,536 --> 04:30:01,197
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, I got it.

3297
04:30:02,118 --> 04:30:08,142
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Vice President Caraviello, as amended by Councilor Scarpelli.

3298
04:30:10,543 --> 04:30:11,704
[SPEAKER_04]: Clerk Herves, please call the roll.

3299
04:30:15,186 --> 04:30:15,747
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Bears?

3300
04:30:15,887 --> 04:30:16,227
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

3301
04:30:16,247 --> 04:30:17,928
[SPEAKER_22]: Vice President Caraviello?

3302
04:30:17,968 --> 04:30:18,288
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

3303
04:30:19,489 --> 04:30:20,009
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Knight?

3304
04:30:20,169 --> 04:30:20,470
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes.

3305
04:30:20,490 --> 04:30:22,031
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Marks?

3306
04:30:22,111 --> 04:30:22,451
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

3307
04:30:26,016 --> 04:30:26,277
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

3308
04:30:28,158 --> 04:30:28,398
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

3309
04:30:28,498 --> 04:30:29,739
[SPEAKER_04]: So many farmers here in the negative.

3310
04:30:29,759 --> 04:30:30,739
[SPEAKER_04]: The motion passes.

3311
04:30:31,340 --> 04:30:31,680
[SPEAKER_09]: Good luck.

3312
04:30:31,740 --> 04:30:32,100
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

3313
04:30:32,140 --> 04:30:32,460
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

3314
04:30:32,941 --> 04:30:33,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Good luck.

3315
04:30:33,321 --> 04:30:34,101
[SPEAKER_04]: And thank you for waiting.

3316
04:30:34,482 --> 04:30:36,763
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

3317
04:30:36,783 --> 04:30:37,343
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good night.

3318
04:30:39,045 --> 04:30:39,365
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

3319
04:30:39,685 --> 04:30:44,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, on the motion of contest, Scarpelli, seconded by console night to revert it back to the regular order of business.

3320
04:30:55,169 --> 04:30:55,290
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

3321
04:30:55,310 --> 04:30:55,570
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

3322
04:30:56,713 --> 04:30:56,933
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

3323
04:31:07,571 --> 04:31:07,851
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

3324
04:31:08,372 --> 04:31:08,912
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

3325
04:31:09,633 --> 04:31:09,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

3326
04:31:09,933 --> 04:31:10,494
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a farmer.

3327
04:31:10,534 --> 04:31:12,255
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there any negative motions passes?

3328
04:31:12,295 --> 04:31:17,560
[SPEAKER_04]: We will now revert to the regular order of business two zero dash five seven four offered by councilor Scarpelli.

3329
04:31:17,600 --> 04:31:18,501
[SPEAKER_04]: Be a result of that.

3330
04:31:18,561 --> 04:31:24,126
[SPEAKER_04]: The director of the board of health get the input from our partners in the medical field.

3331
04:31:24,166 --> 04:31:32,574
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Potter, what's in Dr. Menden with suggestions and strategies in their personal opinions on reopening city hall for in person meetings.

3332
04:31:33,094 --> 04:31:34,015
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli.

3333
04:31:34,535 --> 04:31:35,857
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

3334
04:31:36,317 --> 04:31:39,060
[SPEAKER_09]: Just a clarification, it's Dr. Menon.

3335
04:31:39,781 --> 04:31:40,742
[SPEAKER_09]: That's one of the partners.

3336
04:31:40,782 --> 04:31:44,847
[SPEAKER_09]: I might have made a typo there for the clerk.

3337
04:31:45,607 --> 04:31:52,355
[SPEAKER_09]: But I went back and I watched a few of the Board of Health meetings and

3338
04:31:54,864 --> 04:32:03,290
[SPEAKER_09]: I find it interesting that we do have a consortium of physicians that work with our Board of Health Director.

3339
04:32:03,330 --> 04:32:16,738
[SPEAKER_09]: And it would be nice, just like I said, simple as it is, just to get some ideas of what the health professionals that are working with our Board of Health Director in the process as we move forward and putting together a criteria.

3340
04:32:17,219 --> 04:32:18,399
[SPEAKER_09]: Something that will help, I believe,

3341
04:32:19,480 --> 04:32:25,846
[SPEAKER_09]: The Board of Health Director asked me to put together the plan, so as they move forward, I'd just like their input.

3342
04:32:25,866 --> 04:32:26,807
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you, Mr. President.

3343
04:32:26,867 --> 04:32:27,488
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Council.

3344
04:32:27,508 --> 04:32:28,669
[SPEAKER_04]: Scarpelli, on the motion of council.

3345
04:32:29,330 --> 04:32:30,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Does anybody else want to speak on this?

3346
04:32:33,053 --> 04:32:35,916
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm listening.

3347
04:32:35,996 --> 04:32:36,216
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

3348
04:32:37,558 --> 04:32:42,903
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion of council, Scarpelli, seconded by Vice President Caraviello, Clerk Hurtubise, please call the roll.

3349
04:33:02,529 --> 04:33:02,910
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

3350
04:33:03,110 --> 04:33:04,151
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

3351
04:33:04,191 --> 04:33:04,271
No.

3352
04:33:24,763 --> 04:33:27,664
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, 5 in the affirmative, 2 in the negative, the motion passes.

3353
04:33:27,684 --> 04:33:44,387
[SPEAKER_04]: 20-575 offered by Councilor Scarapelli, being resolved that the city solicitor gives the city council an opinion dealing with open meeting law violations for overcrowding due to fire department protocol on maximum capacity dealing with city council chamber.

3354
04:33:44,847 --> 04:33:45,627
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarapelli.

3355
04:33:46,287 --> 04:33:47,168
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

3356
04:33:50,410 --> 04:34:13,908
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, I'm going to reiterate this council's energy to reopen the council chambers for the residents that have reached out, not to eliminate Zoom, but just to add another avenue for those people that want to be heard and want an opportunity to come to this body.

3357
04:34:16,070 --> 04:34:36,658
[SPEAKER_09]: Talking to my sister colleague from Brockton, one of the things that they asked for with their city solicitor was, as we do here in the chambers, we have a limit of capacity through fire codes during our meetings.

3358
04:34:38,883 --> 04:34:57,335
[SPEAKER_09]: If we relate it to the COVID crisis and we have a set number and posted such, that would be, from what I've been told, might be the avenue that we need to reopen City Hall and making sure we're not violating any open meeting violations.

3359
04:34:57,375 --> 04:35:07,982
[SPEAKER_09]: So I ask this to be sent to the city solicitor to get her opinion and, again, to help me put together this protocol that the Board of Health Director has asked me to do.

3360
04:35:08,063 --> 04:35:08,543
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you.

3361
04:35:09,023 --> 04:35:09,403
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

3362
04:35:09,523 --> 04:35:13,985
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Vice President Caraviello.

3363
04:35:14,145 --> 04:35:15,246
[SPEAKER_04]: Clerk, please call the roll.

3364
04:35:21,689 --> 04:35:22,349
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Bears?

3365
04:35:22,749 --> 04:35:23,089
[SPEAKER_25]: No.

3366
04:35:23,109 --> 04:35:29,392
[SPEAKER_22]: Vice President Caraviello?

3367
04:35:29,632 --> 04:35:29,932
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

3368
04:35:29,952 --> 04:35:33,954
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Knight?

3369
04:35:34,214 --> 04:35:34,474
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

3370
04:35:34,494 --> 04:35:37,576
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Marks?

3371
04:35:37,856 --> 04:35:38,176
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

3372
04:35:40,540 --> 04:35:41,200
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Morell.

3373
04:35:41,481 --> 04:35:41,781
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

3374
04:35:46,104 --> 04:35:46,884
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Scarpelli.

3375
04:35:47,165 --> 04:35:47,385
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

3376
04:35:50,867 --> 04:35:51,608
[SPEAKER_22]: President Falco.

3377
04:35:52,468 --> 04:35:52,708
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

3378
04:35:53,129 --> 04:35:54,510
[SPEAKER_04]: Five in the affirmative, two in the negative.

3379
04:35:54,590 --> 04:35:55,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

3380
04:35:57,772 --> 04:35:59,633
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm sorry.

3381
04:35:59,733 --> 04:36:00,233
[SPEAKER_04]: I missed that.

3382
04:36:00,274 --> 04:36:00,854
[SPEAKER_04]: Six to one.

3383
04:36:00,874 --> 04:36:02,055
[SPEAKER_04]: I apologize.

3384
04:36:03,216 --> 04:36:03,896
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it six one?

3385
04:36:04,897 --> 04:36:05,157
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

3386
04:36:05,317 --> 04:36:07,158
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Morell voted yes.

3387
04:36:07,218 --> 04:36:07,959
[SPEAKER_22]: It was six to one.

3388
04:36:09,292 --> 04:36:09,853
[SPEAKER_04]: You voted yes.

3389
04:36:09,973 --> 04:36:11,035
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you vote yes, Councilwoman?

3390
04:36:11,576 --> 04:36:12,197
[SPEAKER_04]: She did, yes.

3391
04:36:12,257 --> 04:36:12,838
[SPEAKER_04]: Six to one.

3392
04:36:12,978 --> 04:36:13,980
[SPEAKER_04]: My apologies there.

3393
04:36:14,902 --> 04:36:15,483
[SPEAKER_04]: Six to one.

3394
04:36:15,903 --> 04:36:16,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

3395
04:36:17,608 --> 04:36:41,276
[SPEAKER_04]: 20576, offered by Councilor Scott, Kelly, Councilor Marks, and Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the City Administration, Traffic Engineer, and Medford Police Department, Traffic Department, install temporary raised crosswalks on both Main Street and South Street intersection for a temporary period of time to evaluate the long-term safety issues dealing with the horribly dangerous intersection.

3396
04:36:41,356 --> 04:36:43,617
[SPEAKER_04]: This horribly dangerous intersection

3397
04:36:44,557 --> 04:36:46,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Sky Pelley, did you want to speak first?

3398
04:36:46,258 --> 04:36:54,943
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, this is something that at one point I reached out to fellow colleagues that put this on the agenda as well.

3399
04:36:56,940 --> 04:37:00,242
[SPEAKER_09]: This is very troublesome and I don't want to wait until it's too late.

3400
04:37:01,583 --> 04:37:09,108
[SPEAKER_09]: As you, we had another pedestrian death as you saw, not in Medford, but in neighboring communities.

3401
04:37:09,728 --> 04:37:14,311
[SPEAKER_09]: And before we get to this horrifying scene, I'm shocked that we haven't been there yet.

3402
04:37:16,232 --> 04:37:22,616
[SPEAKER_09]: All I want to see is our, it's a very simple ask, is just put those raised crosswalks out.

3403
04:37:23,357 --> 04:37:30,442
[SPEAKER_09]: Slow traffic calming measures that we talked about months ago, and I'll revisit this next week as I ask for a committee meeting.

3404
04:37:30,962 --> 04:37:32,683
[SPEAKER_09]: We did get some great news today.

3405
04:37:34,344 --> 04:37:41,505
[SPEAKER_09]: As great as it is, I don't trust the speed of this outcome, but I'd like to share with everyone.

3406
04:37:41,525 --> 04:37:42,525
[SPEAKER_09]: I know everybody got it.

3407
04:37:42,946 --> 04:37:43,866
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, great news.

3408
04:37:44,046 --> 04:37:47,786
[SPEAKER_09]: I got a call today from Mike So-and-so at MassDOT.

3409
04:37:48,126 --> 04:37:56,508
[SPEAKER_09]: They have identified the intersection of Main Street and South Street as a priority intersection that they would like to partner with us to move forward.

3410
04:37:56,988 --> 04:37:59,629
[SPEAKER_09]: The initial design intersection improvement.

3411
04:38:00,089 --> 04:38:02,009
[SPEAKER_09]: They would hire a consultant to do this work.

3412
04:38:02,549 --> 04:38:10,151
[SPEAKER_09]: in consultation with the city and would like to know if there are any consultants that have been working with us on this intersection.

3413
04:38:10,551 --> 04:38:23,374
[SPEAKER_09]: While we have previously been told that we would have to pay this initial design phase, they are willing to fund this initial because it is on the top 200 dangerous intersections in the state.

3414
04:38:23,754 --> 04:38:29,315
[SPEAKER_09]: And because of this nexus with the shared use path, in particular the south method connector,

3415
04:38:29,955 --> 04:38:33,596
[SPEAKER_09]: That would intersect Main Street right on the other side, Route 16.

3416
04:38:34,037 --> 04:38:37,858
[SPEAKER_09]: Therefore, they see it as an important mass trails connection.

3417
04:38:38,498 --> 04:38:41,740
[SPEAKER_09]: Mayor, please let me know, blah, blah, blah, Alicia Hunt.

3418
04:38:41,760 --> 04:38:48,562
[SPEAKER_09]: So I want to thank Alicia for doing her due diligence to secure this effort.

3419
04:38:50,788 --> 04:38:58,537
[SPEAKER_09]: It's sad that the reasons why aren't safety, it looks like it's connection, but we're looking at a dangerous intersection.

3420
04:38:59,037 --> 04:39:07,346
[SPEAKER_09]: I still want to move forward to ask our traffic department and our city administration to put the portable raised crosswalks.

3421
04:39:08,007 --> 04:39:17,150
[SPEAKER_09]: on those intersections to slow things down and give some information back to the dot as we proceed with this consultant.

3422
04:39:17,710 --> 04:39:26,133
[SPEAKER_09]: And great news, I know council marks last night spent the evening with the ever source team on the south street project.

3423
04:39:26,773 --> 04:39:31,835
[SPEAKER_09]: And they approved speed bumps, I believe in a second.

3424
04:39:32,315 --> 04:39:33,935
[SPEAKER_09]: So I wish it was that easy.

3425
04:39:33,955 --> 04:39:35,916
[SPEAKER_09]: I wish it was ever source to get.

3426
04:39:37,337 --> 04:39:41,880
[SPEAKER_09]: to make something happen that quickly, because this has been monumental to try to get anything done.

3427
04:39:41,900 --> 04:39:47,785
[SPEAKER_09]: A sign, paint, raise crosswalk, and I don't know what it has to take.

3428
04:39:47,825 --> 04:39:53,109
[SPEAKER_09]: And maybe, sadly enough, maybe it takes a death to make something happen.

3429
04:39:53,129 --> 04:39:56,231
[SPEAKER_09]: But this is something that we talked with with the last administration.

3430
04:39:56,571 --> 04:40:00,534
[SPEAKER_09]: This is something we talked with the mayor as she was partnered with us here as councils.

3431
04:40:00,975 --> 04:40:04,918
[SPEAKER_09]: And now as our leader in our community, I impressed on her to please

3432
04:40:05,478 --> 04:40:15,086
[SPEAKER_09]: put these out there, make this happen now, because I would hate to see something happen between now and the end of this consultant's report and changing that intersection.

3433
04:40:15,366 --> 04:40:22,091
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's finally been identified as a top 200 dangerous intersection in the state of Massachusetts, but we've all known that.

3434
04:40:22,292 --> 04:40:24,173
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you for all your hard work.

3435
04:40:24,233 --> 04:40:24,994
[SPEAKER_09]: I appreciate it.

3436
04:40:25,014 --> 04:40:25,834
[SPEAKER_09]: This is great news.

3437
04:40:26,335 --> 04:40:30,818
[SPEAKER_09]: But I still move forward to make sure that we can do that, and I open to my colleagues, so.

3438
04:40:30,858 --> 04:40:31,179
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

3439
04:40:31,999 --> 04:40:33,140
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

3440
04:40:33,160 --> 04:40:33,721
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Marks?

3441
04:40:35,321 --> 04:40:36,242
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

3442
04:40:36,262 --> 04:40:38,564
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to thank my colleagues for co-sponsoring this.

3443
04:40:39,365 --> 04:40:47,271
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone behind this railing has supported one way or another that particular intersection in improving the pedestrian safety there.

3444
04:40:47,811 --> 04:40:53,456
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the first encouraging news since I've been on this council regarding that intersection.

3445
04:40:54,156 --> 04:40:56,498
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to take it at face value, Mr. President.

3446
04:40:56,899 --> 04:40:59,761
[SPEAKER_02]: If they're adding it to their list, I'm encouraged by that.

3447
04:41:00,162 --> 04:41:10,331
[SPEAKER_02]: I look forward to working with DOT in rectifying that whole length of stretch of road to increase safety, Mr. President.

3448
04:41:10,771 --> 04:41:20,460
[SPEAKER_02]: As Councilor Scott Pelly mentioned, I did sit on a call last night with Eversource, and they discussed the Eversource project on South Street.

3449
04:41:21,180 --> 04:41:36,505
[SPEAKER_02]: And Main Street in particular, they discussed that one of their major concerns with doing the excavating and so forth, was that no matter what they tried to do to slow down traffic on South, that they were unable to do so.

3450
04:41:37,465 --> 04:41:52,534
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was actually very enlightening to hear, Mr. President, that what we've been talking about for so many years in residents and abutters, we're hearing from a construction company saying, hey, this is a dangerous stretch of road.

3451
04:41:53,254 --> 04:41:59,678
[SPEAKER_02]: And indeed, as Councilor Scarpelli mentioned, they approached the Chief of Police and the Traffic Commission.

3452
04:42:00,358 --> 04:42:10,687
[SPEAKER_02]: And they saw fit to put some temporary speed bumps in order to slow down traffic, which we've been asking for, I can't tell you how long.

3453
04:42:11,087 --> 04:42:16,312
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were told, you can't impede the flow of traffic, you can't do this, you can't do that.

3454
04:42:17,032 --> 04:42:19,034
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amazing what can take place, Mr. President.

3455
04:42:19,294 --> 04:42:31,464
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is tremendous news and I would like to actually maybe as a council through the administration just follow up to make sure we can secure this commitment.

3456
04:42:32,345 --> 04:42:40,572
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe that may be from a motion from this council asking what we can do as a community to get this ball rolling.

3457
04:42:41,914 --> 04:42:48,247
[SPEAKER_02]: put that in the form of a motion that the city administration as well as the chief of police and

3458
04:42:49,414 --> 04:42:54,138
[SPEAKER_02]: The city engineer and the council send a letter to do.

3459
04:42:54,238 --> 04:42:54,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

3460
04:42:54,618 --> 04:43:06,187
[SPEAKER_09]: Put it as a resolution next week that we call for subcommittee on D O D O T for this exact one, this exact reason.

3461
04:43:06,227 --> 04:43:15,674
[SPEAKER_09]: So we can set up a schedule and meet with them, bring them face to face with us and our state delegates and, um, and have that instead of, uh,

3462
04:43:19,773 --> 04:43:20,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to do it now or?

3463
04:43:23,636 --> 04:43:24,216
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's fine.

3464
04:43:24,236 --> 04:43:32,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever you just said, I'll second whatever Councilor Scott Peller just said.

3465
04:43:32,541 --> 04:43:43,529
[SPEAKER_09]: I amend that we call for a subcommittee with DOT, our state delegates, our traffic department, and our traffic engineer.

3466
04:43:44,651 --> 04:43:55,535
[SPEAKER_09]: And Alicia Hunts, I think she was on the forefront of this, to set up a timeline with the DOT to make sure this comes to fruition.

3467
04:43:56,295 --> 04:44:00,616
[SPEAKER_09]: And we'll try to do that as soon as we can with the Council of Presidents hope.

3468
04:44:00,676 --> 04:44:01,397
[SPEAKER_09]: Transportation.

3469
04:44:02,957 --> 04:44:03,277
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

3470
04:44:03,597 --> 04:44:03,917
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

3471
04:44:04,238 --> 04:44:05,238
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilmembers, are you all set?

3472
04:44:05,819 --> 04:44:08,960
[SPEAKER_27]: I am all set, Mr. President.

3473
04:44:10,180 --> 04:44:14,161
[SPEAKER_27]: So does this mean they're not going to change the direction of South Street like they were talking about three years ago?

3474
04:44:14,362 --> 04:44:16,002
[SPEAKER_27]: We're going to get the speed bumps instead?

3475
04:44:16,142 --> 04:44:17,262
[SPEAKER_27]: One phone call, Councilor Marks.

3476
04:44:17,302 --> 04:44:17,743
[SPEAKER_27]: Great job.

3477
04:44:20,663 --> 04:44:22,304
[SPEAKER_27]: No, Mr. President, you know,

3478
04:44:22,904 --> 04:44:35,134
[SPEAKER_27]: I think it's important also that because this is an issue of funding coming from partners in state government that we make sure that Representative Donato's informed every step of the way on what efforts we're making as a council.

3479
04:44:35,194 --> 04:44:40,538
[SPEAKER_27]: This money didn't get released or given to us because we're good people and we're a nice community.

3480
04:44:40,558 --> 04:44:44,802
[SPEAKER_27]: They got released because we were sending them letters once every two months asking them to look at it.

3481
04:44:45,142 --> 04:44:47,744
[SPEAKER_27]: We were bringing our chief of police down there and we were telling them do something.

3482
04:44:47,764 --> 04:44:48,905
[SPEAKER_27]: We were looking at statistics.

3483
04:44:50,005 --> 04:44:56,807
[SPEAKER_27]: So I think it's very important, Mr. President, that in order to keep the momentum going, that we have our partners in government at the state level involved in this.

3484
04:44:57,007 --> 04:45:00,888
[SPEAKER_27]: And Representative Donato's been a champion on this issue.

3485
04:45:01,289 --> 04:45:03,109
[SPEAKER_27]: He's been very outspoken in his support for it.

3486
04:45:03,149 --> 04:45:10,491
[SPEAKER_27]: So I just ask that any time a correspondence goes out relative to the furtherance of this initiative that Representative Donato's offered.

3487
04:45:21,618 --> 04:45:28,259
[SPEAKER_27]: He's in a very powerful position, Mr. President, so I think that it's important that he be involved in these conversations as well.

3488
04:45:28,299 --> 04:45:35,741
[SPEAKER_27]: As the assistant majority leader, he's going to have the ability to control some purse strings and get us some money, and he's done a great job of that in the past, and I'm sure he'll continue to do so.

3489
04:45:35,801 --> 04:45:37,161
[SPEAKER_27]: So I'd ask that he be involved.

3490
04:45:38,101 --> 04:45:39,121
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

3491
04:45:39,161 --> 04:45:40,001
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilman.

3492
04:45:40,041 --> 04:45:41,262
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Caraviello.

3493
04:45:41,382 --> 04:45:46,583
[SPEAKER_26]: If we could also add Representative Obama, that is her district, if I'm not mistaken.

3494
04:45:46,603 --> 04:45:48,163
[SPEAKER_26]: So if we could add her to that list also.

3495
04:45:48,763 --> 04:45:49,123
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

3496
04:45:50,216 --> 04:45:51,797
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, would anybody else like to speak?

3497
04:45:51,817 --> 04:45:52,718
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Pierce.

3498
04:45:53,578 --> 04:45:54,459
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Mr. President.

3499
04:45:55,800 --> 04:45:58,721
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, I mean, I think we need to move forward in getting something temporary set up.

3500
04:45:59,162 --> 04:46:00,983
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't think, you know, I'm glad that there's progress.

3501
04:46:01,003 --> 04:46:02,384
[SPEAKER_25]: I think that's an encouraging sign.

3502
04:46:02,404 --> 04:46:08,948
[SPEAKER_25]: I think we know that we're meeting about an initial design study, so that means there's more time coming before we get a permanent solution.

3503
04:46:08,968 --> 04:46:17,333
[SPEAKER_25]: And I would just also make sure that we CC Senator Jalen as well, because anything that, anything's going to have to go through both houses.

3504
04:46:17,614 --> 04:46:17,954
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

3505
04:46:19,226 --> 04:46:20,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

3506
04:46:21,328 --> 04:46:29,094
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion of Councilors Scarpelli, Marx, and Knight, as amended by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by?

3507
04:46:29,414 --> 04:46:29,814
[SPEAKER_25]: Second.

3508
04:46:31,175 --> 04:46:33,557
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Caraviello, Clerk Urdoviz, please call the roll.

3509
04:46:42,744 --> 04:46:43,364
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Bears.

3510
04:46:44,285 --> 04:46:44,565
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

3511
04:46:46,187 --> 04:46:47,067
[SPEAKER_22]: Vice President Caraviello.

3512
04:46:47,648 --> 04:46:47,908
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

3513
04:46:49,824 --> 04:46:50,225
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

3514
04:46:50,245 --> 04:46:50,486
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

3515
04:46:56,530 --> 04:46:57,311
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Scarpelli?

3516
04:46:57,411 --> 04:46:57,731
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

3517
04:46:58,311 --> 04:46:59,012
[SPEAKER_22]: President Falco?

3518
04:46:59,152 --> 04:46:59,352
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

3519
04:46:59,692 --> 04:47:00,873
[SPEAKER_04]: 70 affirmative, zero in the negative.

3520
04:47:00,893 --> 04:47:01,774
[SPEAKER_04]: The motion passes.

3521
04:47:01,794 --> 04:47:06,937
[SPEAKER_04]: 2-0-5-7-7 offered by Vice President Caraviello and Councilor Marks.

3522
04:47:07,477 --> 04:47:15,122
[SPEAKER_04]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council have the administration address the issue of disclosure of potential personal information being disclosed.

3523
04:47:15,663 --> 04:47:18,665
[SPEAKER_04]: How many employees were involved and from which departments?

3524
04:47:19,065 --> 04:47:20,206
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Caraviello?

3525
04:47:23,514 --> 04:47:24,094
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Mr. President.

3526
04:47:24,114 --> 04:47:32,576
[SPEAKER_26]: Mr. President, I think we've all gotten the calls and the emails that people have received.

3527
04:47:32,596 --> 04:47:32,796
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm sorry.

3528
04:47:32,836 --> 04:47:41,198
[SPEAKER_26]: I think we've all gotten the emails and the calls from people in regards to the letters they received about their financial information being compromised.

3529
04:47:42,218 --> 04:47:47,820
[SPEAKER_26]: I think that maybe we should sit down in executive session with the administration so

3530
04:47:51,107 --> 04:47:53,988
[SPEAKER_26]: brought up the speed of what's happened and why it happened, when it happened.

3531
04:47:55,288 --> 04:48:00,550
[SPEAKER_26]: And again, I know it's a personal matter, and I think it should be discussed in the executive session, Mr. President.

3532
04:48:00,570 --> 04:48:01,330
[SPEAKER_26]: I'd second the motion, Mr. President.

3533
04:48:01,350 --> 04:48:01,810
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

3534
04:48:01,830 --> 04:48:02,410
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Mr. President.

3535
04:48:02,430 --> 04:48:12,253
[SPEAKER_26]: Vice President Caraviello, when we count the votes, you want to speak on this as well?

3536
04:48:12,273 --> 04:48:12,473
[SPEAKER_02]: Please.

3537
04:48:14,445 --> 04:48:15,205
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

3538
04:48:15,225 --> 04:48:18,227
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to thank Council Vice President Caraviello for co-sponsoring this.

3539
04:48:19,787 --> 04:48:22,168
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to ask several questions, Mr. President.

3540
04:48:22,828 --> 04:48:34,153
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we're going to request a committee of the whole meeting, but I'd like to know what potential disclosure of information was contained and what personal information.

3541
04:48:36,014 --> 04:48:39,395
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to know why no police report was issued.

3542
04:48:42,420 --> 04:48:49,026
[SPEAKER_02]: The city stated they took all available steps to prevent further disclosure and fully investigated this matter.

3543
04:48:49,847 --> 04:48:55,272
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to know, Mr. President, what steps were taken by the city to prevent further disclosure?

3544
04:48:57,995 --> 04:49:01,859
[SPEAKER_02]: And what came out of the investigation?

3545
04:49:04,349 --> 04:49:17,897
[SPEAKER_02]: And Mr. President, just as a note, the President of the Teachers Union filed a green sheet which seeks legal advice on the breach of personal information by school employees.

3546
04:49:18,457 --> 04:49:22,359
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that shows you how serious the nature is, Mr. President.

3547
04:49:22,820 --> 04:49:33,326
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it deserves and warrants more than just an email to us saying that the city looked into this and took steps to prevent further disclosure.

3548
04:49:33,886 --> 04:49:45,657
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would hope that we get more information, Mr. President, on behalf of city employees in this community to make sure their valuable personal information is not compromised.

3549
04:49:46,238 --> 04:49:47,319
[SPEAKER_02]: If I can, Mr. President.

3550
04:49:49,500 --> 04:49:54,222
[SPEAKER_09]: Point of information, if Council March, if you could add one more line to that.

3551
04:49:54,962 --> 04:50:10,249
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that the question I've had is what steps is the city doing for our employees that were violated and are having issues with their personal information?

3552
04:50:10,649 --> 04:50:13,450
[SPEAKER_09]: What are they doing to support them, if that's okay?

3553
04:50:15,371 --> 04:50:15,651
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

3554
04:50:18,820 --> 04:50:28,566
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor, Vice President Caraviello and Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Knight, as amended by Councilor Marks and Councilor Scarpel.

3555
04:50:29,167 --> 04:50:33,930
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Bears.

3556
04:50:34,170 --> 04:50:34,510
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

3557
04:50:34,530 --> 04:50:37,392
[SPEAKER_22]: Vice President Caraviello.

3558
04:50:37,492 --> 04:50:37,812
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

3559
04:50:39,173 --> 04:50:39,713
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Knight.

3560
04:50:40,214 --> 04:50:40,594
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

3561
04:50:41,114 --> 04:50:41,755
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Marks.

3562
04:50:42,175 --> 04:50:42,615
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

3563
04:50:45,377 --> 04:50:45,877
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Rao.

3564
04:50:46,278 --> 04:50:46,598
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

3565
04:50:46,998 --> 04:50:47,538
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Rao.

3566
04:50:47,779 --> 04:50:48,059
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

3567
04:51:05,616 --> 04:51:18,327
[SPEAKER_04]: Be it further resolved, whereas this stretch of road is under the jurisdiction of DCR, that our state delegation assist with traffic calming initiatives along with pedestrian and bike friendly crossings.

3568
04:51:18,707 --> 04:51:19,328
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Marks.

3569
04:51:20,081 --> 04:51:21,142
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

3570
04:51:21,562 --> 04:51:24,204
[SPEAKER_02]: This is on the border of the Arlington Method Line.

3571
04:51:24,904 --> 04:51:32,108
[SPEAKER_02]: And from what I'm being told, it's been a very dangerous intersection for pedestrians, bikers for a number of years.

3572
04:51:33,109 --> 04:51:48,838
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would ask in the interest of public safety, where we're looking at snow ordinance for sidewalk and other traffic calming initiatives, that DCR also look at traffic calming initiatives for pedestrian crossings at that intersection.

3573
04:51:49,738 --> 04:51:53,280
[SPEAKER_02]: intersection as well as bike-friendly crossings, Mr. President.

3574
04:51:53,701 --> 04:52:06,869
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a very difficult road that takes in three or four different avenues and is extremely dangerous for people that are using the Mystic Lakes or walking in the area.

3575
04:52:07,649 --> 04:52:21,123
[SPEAKER_02]: and for passive use, and I would ask that we meet with our state delegation or presenters to the state delegation so they can present it to DCR to look for some traffic calming initiatives.

3576
04:52:22,204 --> 04:52:23,225
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

3577
04:52:23,285 --> 04:52:28,390
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion of Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Knight, Councilor Morell, then Councilor Piz, Councilor Morell.

3578
04:52:28,800 --> 04:52:29,621
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Mr. President.

3579
04:52:29,641 --> 04:52:31,683
[SPEAKER_28]: I want to thank Councilor Marks for bringing this forward.

3580
04:52:31,783 --> 04:52:44,715
[SPEAKER_28]: I am often in that area on foot on my bike and you can travel along the beautiful Mystic River and then you're dumped out onto High Street there with really no crosswalk unless you head back towards Giles Cross and you're still crossing multiple streets.

3581
04:52:44,775 --> 04:52:46,537
[SPEAKER_28]: I've seen people get trapped there multiple times.

3582
04:52:46,957 --> 04:52:50,519
[SPEAKER_28]: And I don't understand when you travel towards Arlington, there's beautiful crosswalks.

3583
04:52:50,579 --> 04:52:52,160
[SPEAKER_28]: That rotary is very well handled.

3584
04:52:52,461 --> 04:52:56,023
[SPEAKER_28]: But when you get back towards Medford, it's a mess and it's a high traffic area.

3585
04:52:56,083 --> 04:52:59,846
[SPEAKER_28]: So I thank the councilor for highlighting this and pushing for action on this.

3586
04:53:00,765 --> 04:53:02,687
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

3587
04:53:02,927 --> 04:53:04,269
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Mr. President.

3588
04:53:05,270 --> 04:53:08,453
[SPEAKER_25]: I've been talking to residents about this and I agree with my fellow counselors.

3589
04:53:08,473 --> 04:53:10,735
[SPEAKER_25]: I think it's also not a safe intersection if you're driving.

3590
04:53:10,776 --> 04:53:13,078
[SPEAKER_25]: I think this is a win, win, win across the board.

3591
04:53:13,098 --> 04:53:19,565
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm not on my bike over there very often, but I am in my car and you can get hit.

3592
04:53:19,685 --> 04:53:23,469
[SPEAKER_25]: You could be hitting someone or you could, your car could be hit either way.

3593
04:53:23,968 --> 04:53:26,870
[SPEAKER_25]: It's a dangerous area that needs to be addressed.

3594
04:53:26,910 --> 04:53:40,999
[SPEAKER_25]: Just one thing for everyone to know that DCR has a study on the whole Mystic Valley Parkway, and technically that intersection is part of the Mystic Valley Parkway, which actually crosses the bridge there from the Arlington side back to the Medford side, and then goes up by the lakes towards the boat club.

3595
04:53:42,040 --> 04:53:45,843
[SPEAKER_25]: So there's a whole study in place, but it's just a study to look at what they wanna do.

3596
04:53:46,063 --> 04:53:53,067
[SPEAKER_25]: It doesn't have a short-term element that would actually address any of the things that we've been talking about, so I think it's really important that we try to work together.

3597
04:53:54,068 --> 04:54:03,195
[SPEAKER_25]: since there is DCR jurisdiction, hopefully they might provide some leeway for some short-term improvements in addition to the study that they have ongoing.

3598
04:54:03,655 --> 04:54:04,636
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Mr. President.

3599
04:54:05,436 --> 04:54:05,776
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

3600
04:54:05,856 --> 04:54:09,539
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion of Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Knight.

3601
04:54:10,239 --> 04:54:11,360
[SPEAKER_04]: Clerk, please call the roll.

3602
04:54:14,282 --> 04:54:14,843
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Bears?

3603
04:54:15,863 --> 04:54:16,144
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

3604
04:54:17,004 --> 04:54:17,905
[SPEAKER_22]: Vice President Caraviello?

3605
04:54:18,145 --> 04:54:18,405
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

3606
04:54:19,046 --> 04:54:19,526
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Knight?

3607
04:54:20,066 --> 04:54:20,286
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

3608
04:54:20,987 --> 04:54:21,627
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Marks?

3609
04:54:21,687 --> 04:54:21,968
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

3610
04:54:22,981 --> 04:54:23,582
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Morell?

3611
04:54:23,822 --> 04:54:24,082
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

3612
04:54:24,663 --> 04:54:25,464
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Scarpelli?

3613
04:54:25,504 --> 04:54:25,984
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

3614
04:54:26,385 --> 04:54:27,025
[SPEAKER_22]: President Fevella?

3615
04:54:27,506 --> 04:54:27,706
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

3616
04:54:27,766 --> 04:54:29,248
[SPEAKER_04]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

3617
04:54:29,268 --> 04:54:30,249
[SPEAKER_04]: The motion passes.

3618
04:54:30,269 --> 04:54:42,662
[SPEAKER_04]: 2-0-579 offered by Councilor Marks be a result that a moment of silence be held for long time Medford resident Joanne Caputo on a recent passing and that the Medford City Council meeting be dedicated in her memory.

3619
04:54:43,283 --> 04:54:43,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Marks.

3620
04:54:44,443 --> 04:54:45,484
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

3621
04:54:45,624 --> 04:54:50,445
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyone that knew Joanne Caputo, she was a sweetheart of a woman, Mr. President.

3622
04:54:50,845 --> 04:54:58,708
[SPEAKER_02]: She was known as the mayor of 99 and 101 Riverside Ave to many of her fellow residents in those two buildings.

3623
04:55:00,268 --> 04:55:03,269
[SPEAKER_02]: She was just a spitfire of a person.

3624
04:55:04,030 --> 04:55:05,690
[SPEAKER_02]: She was very active in our community.

3625
04:55:06,111 --> 04:55:10,372
[SPEAKER_02]: She cared an awful lot for the seniors in those two buildings.

3626
04:55:10,853 --> 04:55:19,596
[SPEAKER_02]: And she watched over them, Mr. President, and just had a real guiding effect on many of the seniors in that building.

3627
04:55:20,337 --> 04:55:26,960
[SPEAKER_02]: You couldn't go to an event, whether it was the meat bingo or whatever else they were doing in that building.

3628
04:55:28,340 --> 04:55:38,408
[SPEAKER_02]: She was always part of what took place, she was always in the center of things, and she was always looking out for the residents of that 99 and 101 Riverside Ave.

3629
04:55:38,808 --> 04:55:44,633
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would ask Mr. President that this meeting be dedicated in her memory, Mr. President.

3630
04:55:44,673 --> 04:55:46,154
[SPEAKER_02]: She will be sorely missed.

3631
04:55:46,786 --> 04:55:47,867
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

3632
04:55:48,427 --> 04:55:52,589
[SPEAKER_04]: At this point, I'd ask everyone to please rise for, oh, I'm sorry, Councilor, Vice President Caraviello.

3633
04:55:52,850 --> 04:55:53,770
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Mr. President.

3634
04:55:54,671 --> 04:55:56,212
[SPEAKER_26]: I thank Councilor Marks for bringing this forward.

3635
04:55:56,532 --> 04:56:02,335
[SPEAKER_26]: I didn't find out about this until he put this out there and I was shocked by

3636
04:56:03,856 --> 04:56:04,436
[SPEAKER_26]: her passing.

3637
04:56:04,496 --> 04:56:05,937
[SPEAKER_26]: Again, Councilor Morocco is right.

3638
04:56:07,137 --> 04:56:16,279
[SPEAKER_26]: She was the mayor of that little group over there and always had all these senior things and everything that happened over there kind of went through her.

3639
04:56:16,960 --> 04:56:20,581
[SPEAKER_26]: So again, her presence will be missed and another loss for our community.

3640
04:56:21,481 --> 04:56:22,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Vice President Caraviello.

3641
04:56:22,621 --> 04:56:25,562
[SPEAKER_04]: At this time, I'd ask everyone to please rise for a brief moment of silence.

3642
04:56:43,677 --> 04:56:43,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

3643
04:56:46,418 --> 04:56:54,580
[SPEAKER_04]: And on that motion, Clerk Hurtubise, on the motion of Councilor Marks, seconded by Vice President Caraviello, Clerk Hurtubise, please call the roll.

3644
04:56:58,261 --> 04:56:58,841
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Bears?

3645
04:56:59,201 --> 04:56:59,481
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

3646
04:57:00,781 --> 04:57:01,682
[SPEAKER_22]: Vice President Caraviello?

3647
04:57:02,302 --> 04:57:02,582
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

3648
04:57:03,402 --> 04:57:03,942
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Knight?

3649
04:57:04,002 --> 04:57:04,282
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

3650
04:57:05,102 --> 04:57:05,703
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Marks?

3651
04:57:06,043 --> 04:57:06,323
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

3652
04:57:07,043 --> 04:57:07,723
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Morell?

3653
04:57:08,043 --> 04:57:08,303
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

3654
04:57:08,863 --> 04:57:09,704
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Scarpelli?

3655
04:57:09,844 --> 04:57:10,104
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

3656
04:57:10,724 --> 04:57:11,324
[SPEAKER_22]: President Falco?

3657
04:57:11,344 --> 04:57:11,404
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

3658
04:57:11,974 --> 04:57:14,395
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

3659
04:57:14,415 --> 04:57:25,620
[SPEAKER_04]: 20-580, offered by Vice President Caraviello, be it resolved that the Medford City Council ask that the residents of Medford to join us in acknowledging October as Breast Cancer Awareness Month.

3660
04:57:26,241 --> 04:57:27,281
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

3661
04:57:27,301 --> 04:57:32,804
[SPEAKER_04]: In the manner as has done in the past, like the dome of City Hall in pink.

3662
04:57:33,304 --> 04:57:34,145
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Mr. President.

3663
04:57:35,444 --> 04:57:44,272
[SPEAKER_26]: Again, it's an issue that I don't think many people haven't been touched by someone in their family, a loved one with breast cancer.

3664
04:57:44,292 --> 04:57:45,593
[SPEAKER_26]: My mother had it twice.

3665
04:57:46,814 --> 04:57:47,835
[SPEAKER_26]: So, and again.

3666
04:57:49,073 --> 04:57:53,516
[SPEAKER_26]: We shouldn't forget, men are also susceptible to breast cancer.

3667
04:57:53,556 --> 04:57:58,619
[SPEAKER_26]: I think people think it's just a woman's disease, but there are many men that get breast cancer, too.

3668
04:57:58,700 --> 04:58:03,603
[SPEAKER_26]: So I thank the mayor, I think she's already lit up the dome in pink.

3669
04:58:04,283 --> 04:58:08,226
[SPEAKER_26]: And I ask the rest of the city to join us in acknowledging Breast Cancer Month.

3670
04:58:09,587 --> 04:58:10,788
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Vice President Caraviello.

3671
04:58:10,848 --> 04:58:14,090
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion of Vice President Caraviello, seconded by Councilor Knight.

3672
04:58:14,450 --> 04:58:15,291
[SPEAKER_04]: Clerk, please call the roll.

3673
04:58:19,226 --> 04:58:19,406
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

3674
04:58:19,446 --> 04:58:19,527
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

3675
04:58:19,547 --> 04:58:19,627
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

3676
04:58:29,517 --> 04:58:30,418
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Scarpelli?

3677
04:58:30,478 --> 04:58:30,858
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

3678
04:58:31,358 --> 04:58:32,039
[SPEAKER_22]: President Falco?

3679
04:58:32,259 --> 04:58:33,860
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, 7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative.

3680
04:58:33,881 --> 04:58:34,741
[SPEAKER_04]: The motion passes.

3681
04:58:34,761 --> 04:58:37,503
[SPEAKER_04]: 2-0-581 offered by Vice President Caraviello.

3682
04:58:37,924 --> 04:58:43,308
[SPEAKER_04]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council look into creating a safe disposable site for fuel, oil, and other waste.

3683
04:58:43,969 --> 04:58:55,518
[SPEAKER_04]: Be it further resolved that the City of Medford join the Lexington Consortium that would allow Medford residents to bring hazard waste to the Lexington facility.

3684
04:58:55,978 --> 04:58:56,799
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Caraviello?

3685
04:58:57,059 --> 04:59:04,868
[SPEAKER_26]: I tell you, Mr. President, this is something I've been called on by residents in the past, and most recently, so and again last week.

3686
04:59:05,749 --> 04:59:11,015
[SPEAKER_26]: We've got that old gasoline from the lawn mowers and snow blowers that hang around the house, and oil and things.

3687
04:59:12,236 --> 04:59:13,237
[SPEAKER_26]: We don't have anywhere to bring it.

3688
04:59:15,652 --> 04:59:24,495
[SPEAKER_26]: Lexington has a facility that allows residents to bring in there, but I guess we're not part of that consortium that allows Medford residents to go there.

3689
04:59:24,515 --> 04:59:28,717
[SPEAKER_26]: So I ask the administration to look into joining that consortium.

3690
04:59:30,077 --> 04:59:42,402
[SPEAKER_26]: In the meantime, we should also be looking into possibly creating a site here in Medford where our residents are allowed to bring hazardous waste like fuel and oil and things like that.

3691
04:59:44,138 --> 04:59:45,339
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Vice President Caraviello.

3692
04:59:45,359 --> 04:59:45,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Second.

3693
04:59:46,659 --> 04:59:48,380
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you like to speak at this conference?

3694
04:59:48,400 --> 04:59:48,880
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, please.

3695
04:59:48,980 --> 04:59:49,761
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

3696
04:59:49,801 --> 04:59:53,522
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion of Vice President Caraviello, seconded by Councilor Bears.

3697
04:59:53,882 --> 04:59:54,483
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Bears.

3698
04:59:54,663 --> 04:59:56,944
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Mr. President, and thank you, Vice President Caraviello.

3699
04:59:57,004 --> 04:59:59,325
[SPEAKER_25]: I've spoken to some residents who've been frustrated as well.

3700
04:59:59,825 --> 05:00:05,928
[SPEAKER_25]: The issue with Lexington is that prior to COVID, you could go even if you weren't a part of the consortium on certain days.

3701
05:00:06,348 --> 05:00:07,909
[SPEAKER_25]: Now with COVID, they've closed

3702
05:00:08,709 --> 05:00:12,710
[SPEAKER_25]: basically only if your city or town is part of that consortium can you go at all.

3703
05:00:13,170 --> 05:00:15,731
[SPEAKER_25]: So it's also kind of this COVID angle to it.

3704
05:00:16,451 --> 05:00:19,912
[SPEAKER_25]: I've spoken to the chief of staff and the DPW director about this.

3705
05:00:20,692 --> 05:00:37,296
[SPEAKER_25]: They've had some kind of alternative suggestions and said they'd get back to me on when Lexington allowed people, but I appreciate Vice President Caraviello bringing this forward because I haven't seen the action, the urgent action on this since the conversations I've had.

3706
05:00:37,776 --> 05:00:38,076
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

3707
05:00:38,527 --> 05:00:38,807
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

3708
05:00:38,827 --> 05:00:40,509
[SPEAKER_04]: Council appears in the motion of vice president.

3709
05:00:40,549 --> 05:00:40,809
[SPEAKER_04]: Copy.

3710
05:00:40,849 --> 05:00:42,211
[SPEAKER_04]: I was seconded by council appears.

3711
05:00:42,251 --> 05:00:43,452
[SPEAKER_04]: Please call the roll.

3712
05:00:44,533 --> 05:00:44,773
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

3713
05:00:44,813 --> 05:00:45,073
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

3714
05:00:45,093 --> 05:00:45,153
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

3715
05:00:45,894 --> 05:00:46,114
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

3716
05:00:56,325 --> 05:00:57,186
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Caraviello?

3717
05:00:57,286 --> 05:00:57,586
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

3718
05:00:57,606 --> 05:00:58,827
[SPEAKER_22]: President Feldkamp?

3719
05:00:59,147 --> 05:01:00,668
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, 70 affirmative, zero negative.

3720
05:01:00,688 --> 05:01:01,649
[SPEAKER_04]: The motion passes.

3721
05:01:01,669 --> 05:01:21,263
[SPEAKER_04]: 20-582 offered by Vice President Caraviello will be a result of the Medford City Council as the Historical Commission or the Building Department to notify residents which have had their building permits reviewed by the Historical Commission within 72 hours after the review has been completed and of decision.

3722
05:01:22,504 --> 05:01:23,405
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Caraviello.

3723
05:01:23,565 --> 05:01:24,246
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Mr. President.

3724
05:01:26,283 --> 05:01:39,647
[SPEAKER_26]: Over, since this, since we've changed the rules for the Historical Commission to do reviews, I've been getting calls from people saying, geez, I've done my thing a couple of months ago, I haven't heard a decision.

3725
05:01:40,147 --> 05:01:42,508
[SPEAKER_26]: And Jennifer Keenan has been very good.

3726
05:01:43,689 --> 05:01:46,650
[SPEAKER_26]: Every time I call her, she gives me an answer probably within half an hour.

3727
05:01:47,190 --> 05:01:50,711
[SPEAKER_26]: But I said to her, I said, why isn't somebody notifying

3728
05:01:51,670 --> 05:01:57,555
[SPEAKER_26]: these residents were either from your departments or the building department that the matter's been resolved.

3729
05:01:58,015 --> 05:02:10,005
[SPEAKER_26]: So that's my question is, let's figure out whose responsibility is to notify either the resident or the contractor that the review's been completed and of the decision, Mr. President.

3730
05:02:11,105 --> 05:02:12,386
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Vice President Caraviello.

3731
05:02:12,667 --> 05:02:14,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Counsel Knight, then Councilor Bears.

3732
05:02:17,504 --> 05:02:29,247
[SPEAKER_27]: Again, Mr. President, the way that things have gone down with the Historical Commission in the past, oh, eight, nine months would lead me to believe that I don't want them to do anything other than what they were doing before what they were doing the last eight or nine months ago.

3733
05:02:29,967 --> 05:02:33,767
[SPEAKER_27]: So with that being said, I'm opposed to Councilor Caraviello's measure this evening.

3734
05:02:33,947 --> 05:02:40,989
[SPEAKER_27]: I feel as though the Historical Commission is exceeding their authority underneath the statute and the efforts and endeavors that they've undertaken in recent months.

3735
05:02:41,229 --> 05:02:43,529
[SPEAKER_27]: And for that reason, I will be opposing this this evening.

3736
05:02:44,210 --> 05:02:44,950
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Councilor.

3737
05:02:44,970 --> 05:02:45,590
[SPEAKER_00]: Councilor Pierce.

3738
05:02:46,121 --> 05:02:53,007
[SPEAKER_25]: Mr. President, I'm really glad that the Building Department and the Historical Commission have finally put together a system to streamline this.

3739
05:02:54,289 --> 05:02:59,413
[SPEAKER_25]: I think it's improved things and I agree with Vice President Caraviello when I've contacted the Historical Commission.

3740
05:02:59,433 --> 05:03:01,655
[SPEAKER_25]: They've been incredibly prompt with me.

3741
05:03:04,778 --> 05:03:07,821
[SPEAKER_25]: It'd be my preference that we strike the

3742
05:03:08,706 --> 05:03:10,506
[SPEAKER_25]: the words the historical commission from this.

3743
05:03:10,547 --> 05:03:16,888
[SPEAKER_25]: I think the building department is the entity responsible for notifying people about building permits.

3744
05:03:16,908 --> 05:03:20,069
[SPEAKER_25]: I think that's a question we have an answer to.

3745
05:03:20,129 --> 05:03:22,850
[SPEAKER_25]: The question is, why aren't those notifications going out?

3746
05:03:23,230 --> 05:03:27,391
[SPEAKER_25]: So that would just be my preference here, if that's fine with Vice President Caraviello as an amendment.

3747
05:03:28,051 --> 05:03:28,451
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

3748
05:03:29,251 --> 05:03:31,552
[SPEAKER_25]: I've had some experience with this as well.

3749
05:03:31,592 --> 05:03:34,273
[SPEAKER_25]: I understand the frustration that property owners are feeling on this.

3750
05:03:35,353 --> 05:03:38,074
[SPEAKER_25]: and having to call and kind of get things moving as a counselor.

3751
05:03:38,094 --> 05:03:40,996
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't think that's how, I don't think that should be our role, quite frankly.

3752
05:03:41,016 --> 05:03:43,117
[SPEAKER_25]: I think it should just be going smoothly.

3753
05:03:44,498 --> 05:03:52,261
[SPEAKER_25]: So I think it also goes back to some other points, which is that I think maybe our building department might need sufficient staffing to get this done as well.

3754
05:03:52,442 --> 05:03:56,223
[SPEAKER_25]: But for now, I just ask that we strike the words, the Historical Commission.

3755
05:03:56,744 --> 05:03:57,084
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

3756
05:03:57,464 --> 05:03:58,324
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Vice President Kirby.

3757
05:03:58,344 --> 05:03:59,385
[SPEAKER_27]: One more information, Mr. President.

3758
05:03:59,445 --> 05:04:00,666
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to make sure.

3759
05:04:00,786 --> 05:04:03,227
[SPEAKER_04]: Cathopia is striking the words Historical Commission?

3760
05:04:03,607 --> 05:04:08,070
[SPEAKER_25]: In the first line, the 10th word.

3761
05:04:08,090 --> 05:04:10,112
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, thank you.

3762
05:04:10,132 --> 05:04:11,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Pierce.

3763
05:04:11,913 --> 05:04:13,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, Councilor Knight, I believe you had a comment.

3764
05:04:13,855 --> 05:04:21,621
[SPEAKER_27]: It's problematic, Mr. President, when everybody that you talk to says they're having some sort of problem getting a permit, some sort of problem getting a permit, unless they know somebody.

3765
05:04:22,301 --> 05:04:25,343
[SPEAKER_27]: They call a city councilor and then they get, oh yeah, it's no problem, I'll get you in a half an hour.

3766
05:04:25,764 --> 05:04:28,106
[SPEAKER_27]: If they don't know somebody, though, they're held up for 17 months.

3767
05:04:29,369 --> 05:04:31,230
[SPEAKER_27]: All right, that's a problem, Mr. President.

3768
05:04:31,250 --> 05:04:32,950
[SPEAKER_27]: I feel as though that's a very big problem.

3769
05:04:33,310 --> 05:04:39,353
[SPEAKER_27]: I also think it's a problem that, you know, there's no guidance from the administration as to how this process is supposed to work.

3770
05:04:39,933 --> 05:04:45,455
[SPEAKER_27]: So now Paul Moky's supposed to notify someone or the building commissioner, right?

3771
05:04:45,475 --> 05:04:48,556
[SPEAKER_27]: The building department's supposed to notify residents which have had their buildings permit.

3772
05:04:49,096 --> 05:04:54,719
[SPEAKER_27]: permits reviewed by the historical commission within 72 hours after the review has been completed of the decision.

3773
05:04:55,259 --> 05:05:06,924
[SPEAKER_27]: Nothing prompts the historical commission to notify the building commissioner within a defined period of time when they get the application or after they make their decision to tell the building commissioner when it is that they can pull the trigger on this.

3774
05:05:07,284 --> 05:05:08,925
[SPEAKER_27]: This is a flawed process from the start.

3775
05:05:08,945 --> 05:05:13,187
[SPEAKER_27]: The changes that have been implemented over the last year, Mr. President, are detrimental to the growth in this community.

3776
05:05:15,438 --> 05:05:15,938
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

3777
05:05:15,958 --> 05:05:25,426
[SPEAKER_25]: Mr. President, I would just want to say, I think comparing this to the situation at 16 foster court is not an apt comparison and I don't think we should be doing that.

3778
05:05:25,626 --> 05:05:25,987
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

3779
05:05:26,507 --> 05:05:26,827
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

3780
05:05:27,568 --> 05:05:36,615
[SPEAKER_04]: Can the motion of vice-president Caraviello seconded by seconded by consumer off court.

3781
05:05:36,775 --> 05:05:38,277
[SPEAKER_25]: Please call the roll as amended.

3782
05:05:38,677 --> 05:05:40,218
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, as amended as I apologize.

3783
05:05:40,278 --> 05:05:41,139
[SPEAKER_04]: As amended by council.

3784
05:05:41,219 --> 05:05:41,760
[SPEAKER_22]: You are correct.

3785
05:05:48,868 --> 05:05:58,075
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we're doing is asking that the building department notify residents once they have the review back from the historical commission.

3786
05:05:59,557 --> 05:06:03,360
[SPEAKER_02]: That they notify residents within 72 hours, is that how I'm reading this?

3787
05:06:14,849 --> 05:06:18,331
[SPEAKER_26]: And they're not notified of it.

3788
05:06:18,952 --> 05:06:24,236
[SPEAKER_27]: I mean, if your application is before a board or a commission and they vote on it, the board of commission should be the one telling you what's going on.

3789
05:06:24,256 --> 05:06:25,417
[SPEAKER_27]: You know what I mean?

3790
05:06:25,657 --> 05:06:26,277
[SPEAKER_26]: It's craziness.

3791
05:06:26,297 --> 05:06:33,603
[SPEAKER_26]: Someone's got to notify the presidents of the decision.

3792
05:06:33,723 --> 05:06:41,109
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm not saying they're calling to ask you to expedite it, but when I called, they said, oh, it's the voter.

3793
05:06:41,489 --> 05:06:42,670
[SPEAKER_04]: There needs to be some follow-up.

3794
05:06:45,247 --> 05:06:49,808
[SPEAKER_27]: There needs to be, someone needs to define who's responsible for issuing a building permit in the community.

3795
05:06:50,928 --> 05:06:52,328
[SPEAKER_27]: I think that's the building commissioner.

3796
05:06:52,368 --> 05:06:56,749
[SPEAKER_27]: It always has been in the past, just like he's always been the person responsible for zoning, right?

3797
05:06:57,369 --> 05:07:05,211
[SPEAKER_27]: So I think that although the council feels as though I'm comparing apples to oranges, I don't think that's necessarily the case.

3798
05:07:05,331 --> 05:07:10,212
[SPEAKER_27]: I feel as though I'm comparing overstep and overstep based upon the statutory guidelines and the ordinance that's in place.

3799
05:07:11,826 --> 05:07:12,426
[SPEAKER_27]: Mr. President.

3800
05:07:12,466 --> 05:07:13,207
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilman.

3801
05:07:13,247 --> 05:07:15,429
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilman Knox, are you all set with your question?

3802
05:07:15,609 --> 05:07:17,630
[SPEAKER_02]: I am, Mr. President.

3803
05:07:17,710 --> 05:07:25,455
[SPEAKER_25]: Again, I think that just goes to the heart of the issue, right, which is the Historical Commission is doing its work promptly, and it's sitting at the building department.

3804
05:07:25,475 --> 05:07:25,796
[SPEAKER_25]: Are they all?

3805
05:07:25,996 --> 05:07:26,256
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

3806
05:07:26,836 --> 05:07:27,437
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes, they are.

3807
05:07:27,457 --> 05:07:28,337
[SPEAKER_25]: Are they all?

3808
05:07:28,398 --> 05:07:28,818
[SPEAKER_25]: They are.

3809
05:07:28,838 --> 05:07:29,098
[SPEAKER_25]: 17 months?

3810
05:07:29,218 --> 05:07:29,438
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah.

3811
05:07:29,758 --> 05:07:31,159
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, Councilman Pierce has the floor.

3812
05:07:31,620 --> 05:07:35,122
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, again, could have showed up to any meeting, but that's another issue.

3813
05:07:37,509 --> 05:07:39,511
[SPEAKER_25]: It's yeah, the Historical Commission's doing them promptly.

3814
05:07:39,731 --> 05:07:42,334
[SPEAKER_25]: It's going to the building department and the notification's not being sent out.

3815
05:07:42,454 --> 05:07:48,540
[SPEAKER_25]: I fully agree with the proposal to have the notification sent out within 72 hours because that's what should be happening.

3816
05:07:48,620 --> 05:07:56,628
[SPEAKER_25]: So the issue here, permitting authorities, the building department, permitting authorities not providing prompt notification, we should ask them to provide prompt notification.

3817
05:07:57,168 --> 05:07:57,548
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

3818
05:07:58,149 --> 05:08:04,972
[SPEAKER_27]: Mr. President, but again, the mechanism is when is the building department getting notified when the determination is being made?

3819
05:08:05,212 --> 05:08:10,195
[SPEAKER_27]: And is there a criteria or a timeline for when that determination needs to be made from the ancillary secondary body?

3820
05:08:11,570 --> 05:08:16,973
[SPEAKER_27]: So can I get a building permit and go give it to Paul Moki and he says, OK, yeah, this has to go to Historic.

3821
05:08:17,113 --> 05:08:18,053
[SPEAKER_27]: He gives it to Historic.

3822
05:08:18,373 --> 05:08:19,474
[SPEAKER_27]: Historic has a meeting on it.

3823
05:08:19,734 --> 05:08:20,614
[SPEAKER_27]: Neva tells him about it.

3824
05:08:20,795 --> 05:08:22,095
[SPEAKER_27]: Or Historic doesn't have a meeting on it.

3825
05:08:22,115 --> 05:08:23,536
[SPEAKER_27]: It has a meeting on it in 45 days.

3826
05:08:23,916 --> 05:08:25,577
[SPEAKER_27]: Are there any defined parameters or timelines?

3827
05:08:27,338 --> 05:08:29,239
[SPEAKER_27]: That's the concern, Mr. President.

3828
05:08:29,339 --> 05:08:30,139
[SPEAKER_27]: There's a breakdown.

3829
05:08:30,759 --> 05:08:31,400
[SPEAKER_25]: Mr. President.

3830
05:08:32,080 --> 05:08:37,582
[SPEAKER_25]: From what we've seen, all evidence, all matters are being addressed promptly and sent to the building department.

3831
05:08:37,922 --> 05:08:43,024
[SPEAKER_25]: If we want to propose some sort of request for a policy change, I'm not opposed to that.

3832
05:08:43,264 --> 05:08:46,065
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm just saying right now, we know where the breakdown is.

3833
05:08:46,845 --> 05:08:51,406
[SPEAKER_27]: Point of information, Mr. President, I think it's been made clear by the council is that as long as you know a counselor and pick up the phone, there is no breakdown.

3834
05:08:51,686 --> 05:08:54,027
[SPEAKER_27]: But if you don't know a counselor and you can't pick up the phone, then there is.

3835
05:08:55,748 --> 05:08:56,368
[SPEAKER_25]: I agree with that.

3836
05:08:56,868 --> 05:08:57,848
[SPEAKER_25]: I call the building department.

3837
05:08:58,849 --> 05:08:59,649
[SPEAKER_25]: That's where the problem is.

3838
05:09:00,623 --> 05:09:03,344
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, on the motion of Vice President Caraviello, seconded by?

3839

[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, 70 affirmative, 0 negative, the motion passes.

3923
05:13:25,791 --> 05:13:31,294
[SPEAKER_04]: Clerk Hurtubise, if I'm correct, we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 committee reports that are tabled.

3924
05:13:31,374 --> 05:13:34,775
[SPEAKER_04]: I have them right here, if we could- Motion to keep on the table, Mr. President.

3925
05:13:34,975 --> 05:13:36,316
[SPEAKER_27]: Motion to take papers in the hands of the clerk.

3926
05:13:36,816 --> 05:13:37,496
[SPEAKER_27]: No, we have two more.

3927
05:13:37,516 --> 05:13:39,057
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, we have two under suspension.

3928
05:13:39,077 --> 05:13:45,940
[SPEAKER_04]: Two under suspension on the motion of council and I, seconded by Vice President Caraviello to take items under suspension.

3929
05:13:45,980 --> 05:13:47,120
[SPEAKER_04]: Clerk Hurtubise, please call the roll.

3930
05:13:54,073 --> 05:13:54,193
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

3931
05:13:54,213 --> 05:13:54,273
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

3932
05:14:05,816 --> 05:14:06,677
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Scarpelli?

3933
05:14:06,737 --> 05:14:07,137
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

3934
05:14:07,637 --> 05:14:09,038
[SPEAKER_22]: President Fevella?

3935
05:14:09,058 --> 05:14:11,259
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, 70 affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

3936
05:14:11,900 --> 05:14:31,391
[SPEAKER_04]: Under suspension, 20-588 offered by Councilor Marks, whereas this is the second request of National Grid to report back on the leaning pole, number 4354, located at 41 Mangle Street, being resolved that the head of wires, Steven Rendazzo, reach out directly to National Grid in the interest of public safety.

3937
05:14:31,912 --> 05:14:32,812
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Marks.

3938
05:14:32,972 --> 05:14:33,673
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. Chair.

3939
05:14:34,213 --> 05:14:47,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, this may seem like a trivial issue, but this is the second time I've offered this on the agenda, and neighbors up on Mangels Street are worried enough to bring it to my attention again.

3940
05:14:47,877 --> 05:14:52,539
[SPEAKER_02]: I requested that National Grid go up and take a look at it and report back.

3941
05:14:53,059 --> 05:14:56,760
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a structural engineer, but my eyes don't deceive me.

3942
05:15:00,971 --> 05:15:01,752
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President.

3943
05:15:02,272 --> 05:15:03,593
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's quite dangerous.

3944
05:15:04,153 --> 05:15:07,154
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a poll that carries electrical wires as well.

3945
05:15:07,535 --> 05:15:09,436
[SPEAKER_02]: And neighbors are very concerned, Mr. President.

3946
05:15:09,916 --> 05:15:22,283
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I, as one member of the council, if I don't get a response, I will not be supporting any issues that come before us with National Grid requests, Mr. President, until they adhere to our request.

3947
05:15:22,643 --> 05:15:24,524
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's true with double polls as well.

3948
05:15:24,904 --> 05:15:30,127
[SPEAKER_02]: If you go around the city now, you're going to see more and more double polls creeping up around this community.

3949
05:15:30,734 --> 05:15:33,696
[SPEAKER_02]: And unless we fight back, they're going to say, you know what?

3950
05:15:33,736 --> 05:15:36,257
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get away with it in the city of Medford.

3951
05:15:36,277 --> 05:15:51,325
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I would ask, Mr. President, that our head of wires, Steve Rendazzo, who does a tremendous job, reach out to National Grid and get a response immediately regarding pole 4354 on Mangles Street in the interest of public safety.

3952
05:15:51,785 --> 05:15:52,726
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilman Marks.

3953
05:15:52,746 --> 05:15:55,447
[SPEAKER_04]: So the motion of Councilman Marks, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

3954
05:15:55,487 --> 05:15:56,648
[SPEAKER_04]: Clerk, please call the roll.

3955
05:15:58,429 --> 05:15:59,029

05:16:05,002 --> 05:16:05,282
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

05:16:06,563 --> 05:16:07,163
[SPEAKER_22]: Council Marks.

3962
05:16:07,243 --> 05:16:07,623
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

3963
05:16:08,424 --> 05:16:09,064
[SPEAKER_22]: Council Morell.

3964
05:16:09,244 --> 05:16:09,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

3965
05:16:10,385 --> 05:16:11,246
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Scarpelli.

3966
05:16:11,406 --> 05:16:11,866
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

3967
05:16:11,886 --> 05:16:13,047
[SPEAKER_22]: Senator Fevella.

3968
05:16:13,447 --> 05:16:13,667
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

3969
05:16:13,727 --> 05:16:15,088
[SPEAKER_04]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

3970
05:16:15,108 --> 05:16:16,009
[SPEAKER_04]: The motion passes.

3971
05:16:16,029 --> 05:16:19,211
[SPEAKER_04]: 20-589, offered by Councilor Marks.

3972
05:16:19,251 --> 05:16:26,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Be it resolved that a moment of silence be held for longtime resident, method resident, Louise Musto-Choate on her recent passing.

3973
05:16:26,635 --> 05:16:27,376
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Marks.

3974
05:16:28,316 --> 05:16:29,257
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you, Mr. President.

3975
05:16:31,720 --> 05:16:35,185
[SPEAKER_30]: that I bring this up tonight.

3976
05:16:35,245 --> 05:16:41,234
[SPEAKER_30]: Louise was a dear, close friend to not only myself, but many, many people in the community.

3977
05:16:41,955 --> 05:16:47,102
[SPEAKER_30]: Louise served her distinction with the Method Arts Council.

3978
05:16:47,794 --> 05:16:52,496
[SPEAKER_30]: Incorporated for many, many years, many of the projects that you've seen around the city.

3979
05:16:53,016 --> 05:16:56,857
[SPEAKER_30]: Louise Musto Cho was very involved, Mr. President.

3980
05:16:57,398 --> 05:16:59,338
[SPEAKER_30]: She was a sweetheart of a woman.

3981
05:16:59,818 --> 05:17:05,480
[SPEAKER_30]: She was dedicated to her family, her friends, and her arts, Mr. President.

3982
05:17:05,941 --> 05:17:08,902
[SPEAKER_30]: If you know Louise, she was a jewelry designer.

3983
05:17:09,182 --> 05:17:12,283
[SPEAKER_30]: She did tapestry, canvas prints, artwork.

3984
05:17:13,916 --> 05:17:19,217
[SPEAKER_30]: She was a very creative person, Mr. President, and was always looking to put the city first.

3985
05:17:19,838 --> 05:17:32,921
[SPEAKER_30]: Over the past few years, I had the opportunity to serve on a citizen-initiated arts center committee, which she was kind enough to let us use her building.

3986
05:17:36,374 --> 05:17:46,070
[SPEAKER_30]: a group of people to use their building in the community room to meet and gather and discuss a potential art center for the entire community at the Heckner Center.

3987
05:17:46,671 --> 05:17:50,918
[SPEAKER_30]: And the loss of Louise is truly devastating for this community.

3988
05:17:54,162 --> 05:17:58,206
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

3989
05:17:58,226 --> 05:18:02,810
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion of Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Knight, Councilor Bears.

3990
05:18:02,830 --> 05:18:05,372
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President, and I just

3991
05:18:21,024 --> 05:18:22,225
[SPEAKER_25]: I won't speak long.

3992
05:18:22,265 --> 05:18:30,610
[SPEAKER_25]: I think Councilor Marks did a wonderful job, but it was really sad to see so many people across our community coming to terms with this news, especially our arts community.

3993
05:18:30,630 --> 05:18:33,472
[SPEAKER_25]: And my thoughts are with everyone who's hurting right now.

3994
05:18:33,833 --> 05:18:34,733
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Mr. President.

3995
05:18:35,073 --> 05:18:36,094
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

3996
05:18:36,314 --> 05:18:38,596
[SPEAKER_04]: And if I may, Vice President Caraviello.

3997
05:18:39,773 --> 05:18:40,573
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Mr. President.

3998
05:18:40,853 --> 05:18:44,894
[SPEAKER_26]: Again, I was floored when I found out, when Councilor Marks called me and told me.

3999
05:18:45,815 --> 05:18:49,876
[SPEAKER_26]: Louise was one of the starters of the art community in the city of Medford.

4000
05:18:50,616 --> 05:18:55,037
[SPEAKER_26]: Again, it was always Medford first with her.

4001
05:18:55,057 --> 05:18:57,118
[SPEAKER_26]: Her always concern was people of Medford.

4002
05:18:57,458 --> 05:19:01,199
[SPEAKER_26]: And as I say, she's a great innovator for the art community.

4003
05:19:01,219 --> 05:19:05,000
[SPEAKER_26]: Again, another icon in our community has passed away.

4004
05:19:05,520 --> 05:19:06,921
[SPEAKER_26]: So, sorry for our loss.

4005
05:19:07,846 --> 05:19:16,833
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, if I just could, I omitted, I put Councilor Caraviello's name on the, we had a discussion.

4006
05:19:16,893 --> 05:19:20,876
[SPEAKER_02]: I put his name on the email that I sent to the city clerk.

4007
05:19:21,777 --> 05:19:31,464
[SPEAKER_02]: I may have spelled his name wrong, but I did put, and I just want to recognize Councilor Caraviello offered that with me as well, Mr. President.

4008
05:19:32,205 --> 05:19:33,806
[SPEAKER_02]: So I apologize for the omission.

4009
05:19:34,267 --> 05:19:36,068
[SPEAKER_04]: The clerk can make that change, not a problem.

4010
05:19:38,547 --> 05:19:44,808
[SPEAKER_04]: Louise was a really, really nice person, and thoughts and prayers go to her family.

4011
05:19:45,668 --> 05:19:58,231
[SPEAKER_04]: She was, as Councilor Mark said, active in all the different arts events and organizations, and you always saw her there, and she was always there participating and helping out in creating art, and she will be missed.

4012
05:19:58,331 --> 05:20:02,172
[SPEAKER_04]: So at this point, I'd ask everyone to please rise for a brief moment of silence.

4013
05:20:23,063 --> 05:20:24,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

4014
05:20:24,383 --> 05:20:30,285
[SPEAKER_04]: On that motion of Councilor Marks and Vice President Caraviello, seconded by Councilor Knight, Clerk Hurtabease, please call the roll.

05:20:33,406 --> 05:20:34,006

[SPEAKER_04]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

[SPEAKER_04]: Records, we have two sets of records.

[SPEAKER_04]: The records from September 8th were passed to Councilor Marks.

4033

[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Marks, how did you find those records?

4034
05:21:02,302 --> 05:21:05,763
