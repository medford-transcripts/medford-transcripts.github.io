23
00:01:52,405 --> 00:01:54,847
[SPEAKER_13]: Certainly, Madam Chairperson.

24
00:01:54,867 --> 00:01:55,808
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm Alicia Hunt.

[SPEAKER_13]: Tonight, we have with us Aditi Mogur.

28
00:02:05,306 --> 00:02:07,207
[SPEAKER_13]: Aditi, you want to introduce yourself?

29
00:02:07,267 --> 00:02:08,908
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, I butcher your name again.

30
00:02:08,928 --> 00:02:10,209
[SPEAKER_15]: No worries.

31
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:10,969
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks, Alicia.

32
00:02:11,289 --> 00:02:12,830

[SPEAKER_15]: I'm the housing planner with the city of Medford.

34
00:02:17,952 --> 00:02:21,034
[SPEAKER_13]: And Clem, do you want to introduce yourself?

35
00:02:23,135 --> 00:02:23,395
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

36
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:27,237
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm Clem Doucette, a graduate student intern at the city.

37
00:02:28,886 --> 00:02:30,728
[SPEAKER_13]: That's it for the staff this evening.

38
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:34,310
[SPEAKER_13]: Although actually, Amanda, I don't know that Amanda is staying.

39
00:02:34,391 --> 00:02:37,693
[SPEAKER_13]: One of our staff planners is, Danielle is on vacation this week.

40
00:02:38,694 --> 00:02:41,216
[SPEAKER_13]: So Amanda has been helping us with some of the technical.

41
00:02:43,818 --> 00:02:45,539
[SPEAKER_13]: Many of you will remember Amanda from the past.

42
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:57,143
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, so the first item on the board, for the board to review tonight is 96-100 Winchester Street.

43
00:02:57,704 --> 00:03:05,852
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a PDD, which is planned, PDD special permit site plan and special permit.

44
00:03:08,335 --> 00:03:13,220
[SPEAKER_17]: So the CDB, the advisory to the city council will only be voting on a recommendation tonight.

45
00:03:14,312 --> 00:03:19,914
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm going to summarize the public hearing and the public meet and legal ad.

46
00:03:21,074 --> 00:03:26,696
[SPEAKER_17]: The Medford Community Development Board shall conduct a public meeting on February 21st, 2024 after 6.30 p.m.

47
00:03:26,736 --> 00:03:37,879
[SPEAKER_17]: via Zoom to make a recommendation to City Council relative to an application by 96-102 Winchester Street, LLC for a planned development district special permit.

48
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:54,014
[SPEAKER_17]: and site plan review to permit the construction of a four-story, 65-unit residential building and a 4,000-square-foot commercial structure at the site known as 100 Winchester Street, comprised of properties located at 96 to 100 Winchester Street, Myford Bluffs, 02155.

49
00:03:56,918 --> 00:04:02,560
[SPEAKER_17]: A public hearing will also be later held by the Medford City Council on March 12, 2024 at 7 p.m.

50
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:08,862
[SPEAKER_17]: in the Medford City Council Chamber on the second floor of Medford City Hall at 85 George P. Hassett Drive.

51
00:04:09,802 --> 00:04:13,683
[SPEAKER_17]: The Zoom link to the public hearing will be posted no later than 48 hours prior to that meeting.

52
00:04:15,364 --> 00:04:18,505
[SPEAKER_17]: Does the staff have any opening comments for this project?

53
00:04:24,995 --> 00:04:25,936
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

54
00:04:26,096 --> 00:04:50,452
[SPEAKER_13]: I just wanted to confirm that everybody is, you just summarized the process, but this has been a long process with many meetings, and I just wanted to make sure everybody knew where we were, that this is in fact the site plan review for this project tonight, and this meeting tonight is advisory to the city council who will be actually voting on it.

55
00:04:53,402 --> 00:04:57,366
[SPEAKER_13]: But if there's any questions about the process, we're happy to field those.

56
00:05:05,535 --> 00:05:08,238
[SPEAKER_17]: So the new PDD1 overlay sets.

57
00:05:09,861 --> 00:05:13,024
[SPEAKER_17]: new dimensional regulations that align with the approved preliminary plan.

58
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:20,330
[SPEAKER_17]: In order to build the proposed development, they must now receive a plan development district special permit and site plan review approval from city council.

59
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:21,511
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's where we're at now.

60
00:05:22,471 --> 00:05:26,815
[SPEAKER_17]: So I am going to invite the applicant to introduce themselves and to please present your proposal.

61
00:05:35,799 --> 00:05:37,701
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you, Alicia?

62
00:05:37,902 --> 00:05:40,826
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, I clicked the bottom.

63
00:05:40,846 --> 00:05:43,030
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me try that again.

64
00:05:44,031 --> 00:05:45,373
[SPEAKER_13]: Sometimes if we can.

65
00:05:45,393 --> 00:05:46,014
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

66
00:05:46,395 --> 00:05:46,796
[SPEAKER_13]: There we go.

67
00:05:46,836 --> 00:05:47,156
[SPEAKER_10]: There we go.

68
00:05:47,176 --> 00:05:47,957
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry about that.

69
00:05:48,802 --> 00:05:50,083
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, thank you very much.

70
00:05:50,123 --> 00:05:51,824
[SPEAKER_10]: Good evening, Madam Chair, members of the board.

71
00:05:52,384 --> 00:05:56,627
[SPEAKER_10]: For the record, my name is Adam Barnosky, with an address of 255 State Street in Boston.

72
00:05:57,167 --> 00:06:00,309
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm an attorney for the applicants on this proposal.

73
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:14,377
[SPEAKER_10]: With me are the developers, Steve and Gerald Nardone, project architects, Peter Quinn and Milton Yu, and the landscape architect, Katia Patadialo, and the engineer and traffic consultant, David Giangrande.

74
00:06:15,455 --> 00:06:18,518
[SPEAKER_10]: So as mentioned by the chair and by Ms.

75
00:06:18,558 --> 00:06:26,706
[SPEAKER_10]: Hunt, this project was before the board as you'll recall last year as part of the plan development district for the site pursuant to section 9.2 of the zoning ordinance.

76
00:06:27,627 --> 00:06:37,237
[SPEAKER_10]: After a review of the submitted materials and deliberation by the board, it was unanimously voted to recommend that the city council adopt the proposed BDD.

77
00:06:38,218 --> 00:06:45,763
[SPEAKER_10]: The PDD was then subsequently approved by the City Council and codified as Section 94-9.2A of the Zoning Ordinance.

78
00:06:46,284 --> 00:06:50,107
[SPEAKER_10]: That ordinance is now known as the Winchester Street Planned Development District.

79
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:58,289
[SPEAKER_10]: So the project as it will be presented to you this evening is a by right project in terms of use and dimensional requirements under the zoning ordinance.

80
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:05,974
[SPEAKER_10]: However, all PDD projects require this PDD special permit by the city council as the special permit granting authority.

81
00:07:06,434 --> 00:07:12,838
[SPEAKER_10]: So, as was mentioned before, at the hearing tonight, the board will be acting as a referral board of the city council.

82
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:18,163
[SPEAKER_10]: So with that said, we're very excited to, again, be before you on this.

83
00:07:18,203 --> 00:07:22,705
[SPEAKER_10]: I know we touched upon many aspects of this proposal when we were first before you last year.

84
00:07:23,486 --> 00:07:24,806
[SPEAKER_10]: We're excited about the project.

85
00:07:24,866 --> 00:07:26,427
[SPEAKER_10]: It has been a long time in development.

86
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:34,791
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to reiterate again and thank the planning staff, leadership, legal counsel, and the planning department for their efforts throughout this process.

87
00:07:35,231 --> 00:07:37,613
[SPEAKER_10]: We know it's a new one for the city and appreciate

88
00:07:38,573 --> 00:07:40,317
[SPEAKER_10]: the undertaking by all the parties to date.

89
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:50,415
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'll provide the board as a refresher with an overview of the property, the project, and then turn it over to the design team to walk through the renderings, landscaping, and engineering.

90
00:07:51,578 --> 00:07:59,240
[SPEAKER_10]: So first about the property, the proposed site is located on the southern portion of Winchester Street, due east from the Ball Square T-stop.

91
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:05,541
[SPEAKER_10]: The site consists of three lots comprised of five tax parcels measuring just under 50,000 square feet.

92
00:08:06,301 --> 00:08:13,423
[SPEAKER_10]: The two lots located at 96-102 Winchester are contiguous through lots with frontage on Winchester and Alfred Street.

93
00:08:14,223 --> 00:08:19,264
[SPEAKER_10]: They've been used for many years as a commercial space for offices, garaging, and outdoor vehicle storage.

94
00:08:20,043 --> 00:08:25,185
[SPEAKER_10]: The lot located at 104 Winchester is a corner lot with frontage on Winchester and Albion.

95
00:08:25,725 --> 00:08:31,827
[SPEAKER_10]: It's improved with a two-story residence that's been deemed preferably preserved by the Medford Historical Commission.

96
00:08:32,548 --> 00:08:38,750
[SPEAKER_10]: The site is mostly located in the GR zoning district with a small portion in the commercial C1 zoning district.

97
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:44,792
[SPEAKER_10]: They are currently owned by 96-102 Winchester LLC, which is the petitioner before you tonight.

98
00:08:45,565 --> 00:08:59,695
[SPEAKER_10]: So the development which Peter Coonan's team will go through in a moment is a four-story, 65-unit residential building with below-grade parking, a two-story, 4,000-square-foot commercial building, and a community pocket park.

99
00:09:00,836 --> 00:09:10,884
[SPEAKER_10]: This would all be located within the new PDD in a portion of the block bound by Wichester Street to the west, Newburn Avenue to the north, Alfred Street to the east, and Albion Street to the south.

100
00:09:11,804 --> 00:09:15,047
[SPEAKER_10]: The proposed developer will raise all existing structures on site.

101
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:24,716
[SPEAKER_10]: with the new four-story building measuring approximately 63,000 square feet with 65 residential units on the first and fourth floors.

102
00:09:24,736 --> 00:09:39,609
[SPEAKER_10]: There will be 46 one-bedroom unit, 19 two-bedroom units, 51 parking spaces below grade, 56 long-term bicycle parking spaces, a roof deck with a pergola, and rooftop solar arrays.

103
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:52,515
[SPEAKER_10]: The existing historic structure that I mentioned momentarily at 104 Winchester will be fully restored and a new addition will be added to the rear to form an L-shaped building measuring approximately 4,000 square feet.

104
00:09:52,995 --> 00:09:56,576
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the only real commercial use in this development.

105
00:09:56,656 --> 00:10:01,538
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be used as a commercial space such as a daycare, office, and gym.

106
00:10:01,558 --> 00:10:06,800
[SPEAKER_10]: You might recall that all of those uses are going to be allowed by right under this new PDD.

107
00:10:08,521 --> 00:10:15,668
[SPEAKER_10]: 104 Winchester will also be improved with a pocket park for public use with new landscaping, hardscaping and benches.

108
00:10:17,255 --> 00:10:23,737
[SPEAKER_10]: As a quick refresher on the PDD, the proposed heights were created in line with recent developments in the area.

109
00:10:24,197 --> 00:10:28,518
[SPEAKER_10]: The setbacks were created similar to existing conditions at neighboring properties.

110
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:39,761
[SPEAKER_10]: We have below-grade parking that's in excess of the parking requirements in the underlying zoning district with reasonable open space and lot coverage requirements for the area.

111
00:10:41,616 --> 00:10:49,761
[SPEAKER_10]: The PD was created and approved by the City Council with the intent to create a gradual transition between the commercial C1 and the GR zoning district.

112
00:10:50,381 --> 00:10:56,605
[SPEAKER_10]: And while the property is primarily located in the GR, it abuts and is partially located in the C1 to the south and west.

113
00:10:57,485 --> 00:11:15,833
[SPEAKER_10]: So we believe that this project meets all the requirements for approval for the PDD special permit under 9.27 and anticipate that the board will find the design and development proposed tonight are consistent with the goals of this PDD individually, as well as more broadly met for its comprehensive plan.

114
00:11:16,613 --> 00:11:18,274
[SPEAKER_10]: And so that's the general overview.

115
00:11:18,294 --> 00:11:22,336
[SPEAKER_10]: I know we want to dig into the engineering as well as the

116
00:11:23,464 --> 00:11:29,066
[SPEAKER_10]: the renderings here, so I'll turn it over to Peter Quinn's team to walk through the architectural renderings.

117
00:11:30,867 --> 00:11:31,227
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

118
00:11:31,487 --> 00:11:33,988
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Adam, and to the board.

119
00:11:34,048 --> 00:11:36,869
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much for this opportunity to present the project.

120
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:42,972
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Peter Quinn of Peter Quinn Architects, 259 Elm Street, Somerville, in Davis Square.

121
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:55,176
[SPEAKER_07]: So the project as we're presenting this evening is not substantially changed from what we presented last summer.

122
00:11:56,357 --> 00:12:01,380
[SPEAKER_07]: But nonetheless, I will start from the beginning and go briefly through what we're proposing to do.

123
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:14,922
[SPEAKER_07]: I have with me also tonight Katya from Verdant Landscaping and David Gene Grande from GM2 for both civil and for the traffic study.

124
00:12:16,163 --> 00:12:19,243
[SPEAKER_07]: So to begin, I'm sharing my screen first here.

125
00:12:21,864 --> 00:12:29,125
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, so big picture.

126
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,921
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a lot that is a through lot.

127
00:12:33,342 --> 00:12:35,283
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can see this is from Winchester Street.

128
00:12:36,063 --> 00:12:38,984
[SPEAKER_07]: And it goes all the way through to Alfred.

129
00:12:41,586 --> 00:12:46,888
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there's a corner portion, which has an existing historic structure on it.

130
00:12:48,169 --> 00:12:50,110
[SPEAKER_07]: This historic structure will not be raised.

131
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:52,291
[SPEAKER_07]: This will be actually retained.

132
00:12:52,311 --> 00:12:57,753
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a small part of it that will be taken off in the back that's a later L edition.

133
00:12:59,785 --> 00:13:01,346
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'll go into that in a little while.

134
00:13:01,946 --> 00:13:15,210
[SPEAKER_07]: But the main things I want to point out about this building, the new building, is that we are trying to break down the mass of this building as much as possible to be compatible with the neighborhood.

135
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:22,192
[SPEAKER_07]: We know it's a large building, but it actually has a lot of lovely features that I think will add to the neighborhood.

136
00:13:22,812 --> 00:13:28,174
[SPEAKER_07]: So for instance, you'll see that there are these paneled projected bays.

137
00:13:29,114 --> 00:13:39,040
[SPEAKER_07]: These are elements that we're trying to introduce to give it a townhouse-like quality to the project.

138
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:44,783
[SPEAKER_07]: I think nearly all the units have personal balconies, unit balconies, one kind or another.

139
00:13:44,803 --> 00:13:47,764
[SPEAKER_07]: Some are quite generous, others are smaller.

140
00:13:48,825 --> 00:13:55,609
[SPEAKER_07]: These are often at the corner or they break up the mass as the building works its way down through the site.

141
00:13:56,867 --> 00:14:04,019
[SPEAKER_07]: One thing I would like to point out about the site is that it has a tremendous amount of slope to it that we use to our advantage.

142
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:10,109
[SPEAKER_07]: The slope begins at this high end, at the right-hand corner, where

143
00:14:12,693 --> 00:14:15,294
[SPEAKER_07]: Winchester meets to the back corner in Alfred.

144
00:14:15,394 --> 00:14:20,735
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think it's approximately one story, but difference.

145
00:14:21,495 --> 00:14:24,776
[SPEAKER_07]: So that has actually helped us with the massing of this building.

146
00:14:24,816 --> 00:14:31,318
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can see in this drawing here, how we are dealing with the massing, I think fairly easily.

147
00:14:32,158 --> 00:14:41,440
[SPEAKER_07]: So on the right hand side, you have Winchester Street, and it's a sidewalk and generous setback with lots of room for landscaping.

148
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:51,251
[SPEAKER_07]: That part of the building is actually four stories, even though we've broken it down so that there's a three-story portion sitting on a brick base.

149
00:14:51,952 --> 00:14:55,956
[SPEAKER_07]: This brick base is exposed because this is our driveway down to the underground garage.

150
00:14:57,778 --> 00:15:24,427
[SPEAKER_07]: Above the three-story portion, where you can see how the balconies break up the mass and create these townhouse-like structures, above that is a four-story that is stepped back five feet in order to have a fourth floor, but also to reduce the mass of it, and we darken the color of it with a wood-like finish that will help the building meet a little better as a kind of broken-down mass.

151
00:15:26,758 --> 00:15:33,280
[SPEAKER_07]: And then as you enter the site or you travel across the site, as I mentioned, the grade steps down.

152
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:35,061
[SPEAKER_07]: So we've also stepped the building down.

153
00:15:35,841 --> 00:15:38,322
[SPEAKER_07]: And the building is divided front to rear.

154
00:15:38,382 --> 00:15:43,164
[SPEAKER_07]: There's the Winchester portion, which is on the right-hand side here, and then the alpha portion.

155
00:15:43,862 --> 00:15:50,928
[SPEAKER_07]: So the Alfred portion is three stories with a small amount that's four stories that's also stepped back.

156
00:15:51,669 --> 00:15:57,814
[SPEAKER_07]: So really by the time you get to the far end on the left, you're only seeing a three-story building.

157
00:15:58,715 --> 00:16:09,324
[SPEAKER_07]: And that I think helps with the transition to the neighborhood scale that Alfred Street has, and also allows us to work with the grades of the site much better.

158
00:16:10,025 --> 00:16:14,629
[SPEAKER_07]: So connecting those two wings, left and right, is a vertical core.

159
00:16:14,749 --> 00:16:31,944
[SPEAKER_07]: That's where we have our elevator, one of our stairways, and a lot of other features going all the way down into the basement that are important to distribute through the building, such as our bike room, our electrical room, and our trash core as well, trash chutes.

160
00:16:34,793 --> 00:16:38,275
[SPEAKER_07]: Just to give you an idea on the appearance of this.

161
00:16:39,155 --> 00:16:42,437
[SPEAKER_07]: The building has these projected bases I mentioned.

162
00:16:42,457 --> 00:16:51,162
[SPEAKER_07]: These are fiber cement, rain screen with windows that are most likely casements, high energy efficiency windows.

163
00:16:52,103 --> 00:17:00,168
[SPEAKER_07]: Then as I mentioned, as you layer back toward the fourth floor, that would go to a wood finish type material.

164
00:17:02,471 --> 00:17:10,858
[SPEAKER_07]: The whole building is sitting on this brick base, as I mentioned, and that base does provide some terraces around the perimeter of the building as well.

165
00:17:12,499 --> 00:17:20,966
[SPEAKER_07]: The commercial building to the right consists of the original portion that we hope to restore and actually enhance with the front porch.

166
00:17:22,077 --> 00:17:29,687
[SPEAKER_07]: doesn't have now and then to produce a wing off the rear as well as a connecting core that has an elevator in it.

167
00:17:30,648 --> 00:17:38,377
[SPEAKER_07]: The idea is that this is a commercial building and would be suitable for any number of uses that are allowed in this district.

168
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:49,743
[SPEAKER_07]: And its primary entry is through the back, not really the back, but from the Albion Street side where there's some drop-off locations.

169
00:17:50,743 --> 00:17:52,163
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can see there's a tree here.

170
00:17:52,223 --> 00:18:00,486
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually, I think the existing tree is much larger, but that tree would be preserved and made into kind of like a center of a courtyard.

171
00:18:01,546 --> 00:18:04,267
[SPEAKER_07]: So that would be a lovely kind of commercial space as well.

172
00:18:06,817 --> 00:18:11,618
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll go a little farther into the 3D models.

173
00:18:12,718 --> 00:18:16,299
[SPEAKER_07]: First, I'll show you the bird's-eye view.

174
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,639
[SPEAKER_07]: So this one I started with earlier.

175
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:28,361
[SPEAKER_07]: You can see how the terraces here are formed by the way the brick base is set on the ground.

176
00:18:29,221 --> 00:18:34,962
[SPEAKER_07]: The building also has a shift in it, where it has a point at which the building

177
00:18:35,722 --> 00:18:39,385
[SPEAKER_07]: shifts to the left or to the right if you're looking at the front.

178
00:18:40,346 --> 00:18:48,753
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, that also helps reduce the apparent mass of the building so you don't leave it as a 200-some-odd-feet-long building.

179
00:18:49,874 --> 00:19:03,225
[SPEAKER_07]: So the roof, of course, has lots of room for solar panels, which we're hoping to install, as well as high-efficiency heat pump systems that will be

180
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:10,066
[SPEAKER_07]: placed mostly in the center so that the neighbors won't see them or hear them.

181
00:19:11,167 --> 00:19:14,969
[SPEAKER_07]: And then further back, we just go around the building a little bit.

182
00:19:15,569 --> 00:19:20,272
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a view where you can see our driveway coming in off Winchester Street.

183
00:19:21,253 --> 00:19:24,255
[SPEAKER_07]: And that is the regulation 24 feet from Fire Chief.

184
00:19:25,115 --> 00:19:26,636
[SPEAKER_07]: But you can also see the terrace here.

185
00:19:26,656 --> 00:19:31,660
[SPEAKER_07]: These would be usable for the residents of those units that they cross from them.

186
00:19:33,781 --> 00:19:39,326
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, now the massing is broken up by these townhouses.

187
00:19:39,807 --> 00:19:42,089
[SPEAKER_07]: At the bottom of the ramp, there are two garage doors.

188
00:19:42,289 --> 00:19:48,715
[SPEAKER_07]: That's our trash room that is directly connected to some trash chutes that come down through a core.

189
00:19:49,676 --> 00:19:52,499
[SPEAKER_07]: And all the trash is handled, you know, that way.

190
00:19:54,821 --> 00:20:01,346
[SPEAKER_07]: Fresh truck would simply back down here, open up, you know, the garage doors would be opened up and they'd roll out the bins.

191
00:20:02,247 --> 00:20:03,488
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's very efficient.

192
00:20:03,748 --> 00:20:11,294
[SPEAKER_07]: And similarly, there's a door that leads into the garage where we have two levels of parking.

193
00:20:11,314 --> 00:20:17,619
[SPEAKER_07]: Just to show you that briefly, the parking is, excuse me,

194
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:22,313
[SPEAKER_07]: split between, this is the rear half here.

195
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:24,915
[SPEAKER_07]: There's actually 49 spaces.

196
00:20:24,936 --> 00:20:32,604
[SPEAKER_07]: We originally had 51, and then engineering asked us to eliminate two of them that were problematic for clearances.

197
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:35,928
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're showing those two as eliminated.

198
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:42,431
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're approximately 50% split each way, half and half.

199
00:20:43,191 --> 00:20:50,814
[SPEAKER_07]: The lower garage has 26 spaces, and the upper garage has, I'm sorry, 25 and 24.

200
00:20:59,185 --> 00:21:06,506
[SPEAKER_07]: As we go up to the building, we have a simple entry vestibule, and then some amenity space off to the side of it.

201
00:21:06,887 --> 00:21:15,368
[SPEAKER_07]: We pass through a security area, and then we're into really kind of generous layouts.

202
00:21:15,588 --> 00:21:17,789
[SPEAKER_07]: They're quite nicely sized.

203
00:21:18,969 --> 00:21:28,311
[SPEAKER_07]: Most of our one bedrooms are in the 650 to 750 square foot range, with the exception of some smaller studios on the roof.

204
00:21:29,331 --> 00:21:35,455
[SPEAKER_07]: And most of our two bedrooms are 950 to 1050 square feet as well.

205
00:21:35,695 --> 00:21:40,198
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're mid-size plus these outdoor spaces as well.

206
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:45,921
[SPEAKER_07]: And that layout continues right up to the building.

207
00:21:46,782 --> 00:21:55,047
[SPEAKER_07]: As I mentioned, we have our central area, which has core functions such as a trash and janitors' closets, and then the stairway elevator.

208
00:21:56,527 --> 00:22:05,201
[SPEAKER_07]: The buildings are front to rear three feet different in height, so we have an elevator that has doors on front and rear in order to allow that to happen.

209
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:09,941
[SPEAKER_07]: And also on our roof level, we have a common deck out here.

210
00:22:10,402 --> 00:22:16,004
[SPEAKER_07]: This is completely screened from our neighbors with a six-foot high screening and planters.

211
00:22:17,025 --> 00:22:21,387
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, that will need some design detail.

212
00:22:21,447 --> 00:22:27,590
[SPEAKER_07]: It also has a pergola to provide some screening and shading in the summer.

213
00:22:29,345 --> 00:22:41,036
[SPEAKER_07]: But I doubt very much that anybody will see this from the street, because as you can see in these renderings, it's pushed back quite far.

214
00:22:41,256 --> 00:22:48,583
[SPEAKER_07]: So this, for instance, is the Albert Street view, but you can't see very much up there at all.

215
00:22:49,624 --> 00:22:50,465
[SPEAKER_07]: And likewise, even

216
00:22:51,297 --> 00:23:01,503
[SPEAKER_07]: From this corner, you're just seeing the stair tower and a few other things up there, but no mechanical equipment or anything like that is visible.

217
00:23:02,084 --> 00:23:04,946
[SPEAKER_07]: In the aerial view, I already showed that one.

218
00:23:06,647 --> 00:23:08,768
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's another view looking over our driveway.

219
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:13,431
[SPEAKER_07]: You can see how this building steps back as it goes.

220
00:23:14,091 --> 00:23:16,693
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is the enclosed deck area in the rear here.

221
00:23:21,452 --> 00:23:23,473
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a view looking over Alfred Street.

222
00:23:24,113 --> 00:23:26,514
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, you can see how the building steps down as it goes.

223
00:23:27,454 --> 00:23:32,076
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is our screened deck area as well.

224
00:23:33,117 --> 00:23:34,517
[SPEAKER_07]: So lots of room for solar panels.

225
00:23:34,557 --> 00:23:35,558
[SPEAKER_07]: We're excited about that.

226
00:23:36,118 --> 00:23:40,279
[SPEAKER_07]: And what we've shown here is just simply schematic.

227
00:23:40,299 --> 00:23:44,061
[SPEAKER_07]: There'll probably be room for even more when the final layout comes.

228
00:23:45,975 --> 00:23:52,560
[SPEAKER_07]: The final aerial view looking over the whole project from Alfred Street as well, different corner.

229
00:23:55,867 --> 00:24:10,679
[SPEAKER_07]: The building has a lot of interesting features, but it really does come down to the way you have these recessed balconies and then a kind of townhouse area with the bays.

230
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:14,442
[SPEAKER_07]: And this constitutes three units stacked one over the other.

231
00:24:14,462 --> 00:24:17,505
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we just repeat that around the whole building.

232
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:20,347
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see, what else?

233
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:29,924
[SPEAKER_07]: I mentioned right now our unit count is we have 46 one bedrooms and 19 two bedrooms.

234
00:24:29,984 --> 00:24:42,952
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's mostly one bedrooms, which we believe is appropriate for the location of this building, so close to the T. It would provide a good price point for either rentals or sales.

235
00:24:43,852 --> 00:24:51,997
[SPEAKER_07]: And it is very much in demand, as you can imagine, to have these kinds of units available.

236
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:56,743
[SPEAKER_07]: What else can I show you at this point?

237
00:24:58,224 --> 00:25:00,487
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that pretty much covers it.

238
00:25:00,987 --> 00:25:03,410
[SPEAKER_07]: I can go into some statistics on the building if you'd like.

239
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:08,795
[SPEAKER_07]: I also have a shadow study, which I'll show you briefly if you'd like.

240
00:25:08,815 --> 00:25:13,900
[SPEAKER_07]: Madam Chair, is that something that would be useful for the board to see?

241
00:25:16,022 --> 00:25:16,563
[SPEAKER_07]: Shadow study.

242
00:25:18,014 --> 00:25:18,635
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, please.

243
00:25:18,715 --> 00:25:19,196
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

244
00:25:19,496 --> 00:25:19,897
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, sure.

245
00:25:19,937 --> 00:25:20,277
[SPEAKER_07]: No problem.

246
00:25:21,018 --> 00:25:26,446
[SPEAKER_07]: So, the way we laid this out was starting in spring and fall, March 21st, which is coming up.

247
00:25:28,008 --> 00:25:33,596
[SPEAKER_07]: So, we, we 1st, look at the existing shadows that the building produces the buildings that are there.

248
00:25:35,121 --> 00:25:53,957
[SPEAKER_07]: We have the benefit here that most of the two existing warehouse-type structures that are on the site are right on the property line or close to it, and therefore, they cast quite large shadows on their neighbors even though they're essentially just one tall story high.

249
00:25:55,490 --> 00:26:00,474
[SPEAKER_07]: So in the early morning, we would add some additional shadows across the street on Winchester.

250
00:26:00,494 --> 00:26:02,135
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what the yellow represents.

251
00:26:02,455 --> 00:26:06,218
[SPEAKER_07]: That yellow represents increased shadow over the existence.

252
00:26:07,238 --> 00:26:10,861
[SPEAKER_07]: By noon, most of our shadows are very minimal, mostly staying on site.

253
00:26:10,881 --> 00:26:19,507
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is what we would witness in a month from now, almost exactly one month from tonight.

254
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:24,362
[SPEAKER_07]: date that I'm looking forward to, getting some spring around here.

255
00:26:25,123 --> 00:26:33,168
[SPEAKER_07]: And then later in the day, when the shadows get a little longer, we do have a small amount of shadow on our neighbors.

256
00:26:33,729 --> 00:26:37,091
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's actually quite minimal that time of year.

257
00:26:37,631 --> 00:26:39,292
[SPEAKER_07]: And as you can imagine, in summer,

258
00:26:40,513 --> 00:26:42,136
[SPEAKER_07]: It's virtually non-existent.

259
00:26:42,777 --> 00:26:49,627
[SPEAKER_07]: So a little bit in the early morning, you get some shadows across Winchester Street onto the commercial structures over there.

260
00:26:50,789 --> 00:26:55,796
[SPEAKER_07]: But by noon, they're all completely on site and well into late in the day.

261
00:26:57,073 --> 00:26:59,874
[SPEAKER_07]: In the winter, of course, everybody's shadowing everybody else.

262
00:27:00,775 --> 00:27:03,456
[SPEAKER_07]: And we would be no exception to that.

263
00:27:04,377 --> 00:27:08,979
[SPEAKER_07]: Early in the morning, there's actually everything that's pretty much in shadow anyways.

264
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:15,602
[SPEAKER_07]: But there'd be small pockets on the rooftops and the like that would get more shadow.

265
00:27:17,243 --> 00:27:21,666
[SPEAKER_07]: By midday during the winter, this would be December 20th or 21st, we would have

266
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:29,133
[SPEAKER_07]: Some increased shadows on our neighbors, mostly in backyards.

267
00:27:30,975 --> 00:27:35,319
[SPEAKER_07]: As the sun moves around, it's quite low at that time of year, as you can imagine.

268
00:27:36,099 --> 00:27:45,127
[SPEAKER_07]: And then finally, late in the day, we had shadow back into this corner on Elkwood Street, most of it affecting one or two neighbors.

269
00:27:47,618 --> 00:27:57,522
[SPEAKER_07]: But again, for the most part, for such a fairly large building, we are really minimally casting shadows.

270
00:27:59,583 --> 00:28:03,004
[SPEAKER_07]: You have some images of the materials that we're using.

271
00:28:03,704 --> 00:28:07,566
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is the lap siding, the blue siding that we have on most of the building.

272
00:28:08,226 --> 00:28:10,147
[SPEAKER_07]: And then this kind of rendered wood material.

273
00:28:10,167 --> 00:28:17,250
[SPEAKER_07]: This is actually a material that has a variation like wood, but it is

274
00:28:20,077 --> 00:28:22,538
[SPEAKER_07]: kind of recycled base.

275
00:28:23,978 --> 00:28:30,800
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we had the white bays are actually fiber cement rain screens with a nice joint detailing on them.

276
00:28:32,081 --> 00:28:36,442
[SPEAKER_07]: We have some thin brick in here that we would put on the base of the building dimension.

277
00:28:36,622 --> 00:28:47,285
[SPEAKER_07]: And then our railings would be like a metal screening with post and caps and so forth.

278
00:28:48,557 --> 00:28:50,518
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a basic guide to the materials.

279
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:54,761
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think I will stop there, take questions.

280
00:28:55,402 --> 00:28:58,344
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm happy to answer those.

281
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:11,013
[SPEAKER_07]: And also, at this time, I'll pass on, if there are no questions immediately, I'll pass it on to Katia Posadilo.

282
00:29:12,994 --> 00:29:17,918
[SPEAKER_07]: And we will have a presentation on the landscape

283
00:29:20,106 --> 00:29:20,867
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we have that.

284
00:29:22,608 --> 00:29:23,229
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Peter.

285
00:29:23,249 --> 00:29:27,152
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me bring it up.

286
00:29:27,732 --> 00:29:29,414
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, that'd be great.

287
00:29:29,774 --> 00:29:31,316
[SPEAKER_03]: So my name is Katja Posadlo.

288
00:29:31,636 --> 00:29:33,918
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the principal at Verdant Landscape Architecture.

289
00:29:35,799 --> 00:29:39,422
[SPEAKER_03]: And what you see here is our overall landscape plan for the site.

290
00:29:40,203 --> 00:29:44,547
[SPEAKER_03]: You see the largest light green circles are the existing trees to remain.

291
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:51,944
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the other shaded in slightly darker green circles are the proposed new trees and vegetation.

292
00:29:51,964 --> 00:29:58,365
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to walk you through the design around the site, and I'll try to be brief so we can get on with the presentation.

293
00:29:59,745 --> 00:30:06,207
[SPEAKER_03]: So first, I'm going to go through the ways in which we support residential use around the larger of the two buildings here.

294
00:30:06,647 --> 00:30:14,088
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we'll look at the landscape around the existing blue house to be retained at the corner, along with its addition.

295
00:30:15,608 --> 00:30:17,950
[SPEAKER_03]: So how is the landscape designed around the residential building?

296
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:23,973
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the building is designed with sort of like two faces because it spans the whole block there.

297
00:30:24,093 --> 00:30:28,476
[SPEAKER_03]: One on Winchester Street, which is on the left, and then one on Alfred Street to the right.

298
00:30:29,336 --> 00:30:34,779
[SPEAKER_03]: However, those areas are a little bit different because along the left, Winchester Street is really the primary front door entry.

299
00:30:37,241 --> 00:30:42,565
[SPEAKER_03]: and the one on Alfred Street's a little bit more like a backdoor and that faces the residential zone.

300
00:30:42,685 --> 00:30:43,926
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you.

301
00:30:43,946 --> 00:30:50,711
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to zoom in and look at the area along Winchester Street to take a closer look at the front entry on Winchester Street here.

302
00:30:50,731 --> 00:30:56,455
[SPEAKER_03]: We also have the driveway located along the top of the page there that goes down to the garages.

303
00:30:56,776 --> 00:31:05,482
[SPEAKER_03]: So most of the cars will be coming and going from that location, not on the other end, and those driveways do not connect through as Peter described.

304
00:31:06,783 --> 00:31:16,811
[SPEAKER_03]: But what you note here is that we have some more formal plantings and symmetrically arranged plantings because of this slightly more formal use in the front entry.

305
00:31:16,831 --> 00:31:24,918
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some front steps going up to the front door and we also have an accessible route along the bottom part of the page here to get to the front door.

306
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:32,125
[SPEAKER_03]: We go to the next slide you see on the other end of the building how we've treated the Alfred Street side of things a little bit differently.

307
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:34,587
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little bit of a quieter yard area.

308
00:31:34,607 --> 00:31:37,249
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little more naturalistic in its composition.

309
00:31:37,889 --> 00:31:44,495
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some existing trees along the property line at the back of the sidewalk existing sidewalk so we're proposing to thin those out.

310
00:31:45,296 --> 00:31:47,578
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some invasive species in there, as well as.

311
00:31:48,552 --> 00:32:06,215
[SPEAKER_03]: Some other things we want to promote some better growth for a few that are that are there and you know provide more enough sunlight for the some existing trees there so we're going to protect a few of them and remove a few of them and then under plant with a lot of different shrubs and small trees, as well as a new street tree up near the driveway.

312
00:32:06,822 --> 00:32:13,063
[SPEAKER_03]: And the driveway that you see here is really not a driveway for any residential use associated with this project.

313
00:32:13,124 --> 00:32:18,565
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just an emergency driveway for fire trucks that was part of the requirements for this project development.

314
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:35,329
[SPEAKER_03]: But in lieu of a 24 foot wide drive aisle, which is the requirement, we're reducing the paved appearance of that driveway by dedicating a portion of it to be what we see in the picture there, which is checker block paving, which will appear more like lawn.

315
00:32:36,149 --> 00:32:38,670
[SPEAKER_03]: Although it's structured enough for fire trucks to drive over.

316
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:55,756
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, we could go back to slide one for a moment in the landscape just want to point out something else, Peter had mentioned and maybe I don't need to go into too much depth here but the north and the south sides of the building have unit balconies and porches and things.

317
00:32:56,996 --> 00:33:13,781
[SPEAKER_03]: Along both edges, and we have provided a nice green backdrop to the locations where we have ability to plant and where there are private terraces, like on the on the garage deck areas, there'll be I'm sure the residents who live there will probably place planters and patio furnishings within their terraces where.

318
00:33:14,241 --> 00:33:19,262
[SPEAKER_03]: there aren't plantings able to be planted like within the locations that are on top of the garage structure.

319
00:33:19,282 --> 00:33:27,063
[SPEAKER_03]: So there'll be, you know, small, small and large size, different various kinds of patios and porches for the residents to enjoy.

320
00:33:27,083 --> 00:33:35,145
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I'd like to go back to, I think we can move on to L4, which is the fourth page, obviously, I guess, yeah.

321
00:33:35,545 --> 00:33:41,126
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to look at the landscape around the historic home that's being renovated to be a retail use.

322
00:33:43,643 --> 00:33:47,146
[SPEAKER_03]: So as Peter described, we're maintaining the historic core of the building.

323
00:33:47,967 --> 00:33:53,232
[SPEAKER_03]: We're also going to be protecting the shade tree that's located just to the south of that existing house.

324
00:33:54,253 --> 00:33:58,056
[SPEAKER_03]: And once the addition along the right hand side of our diagram there.

325
00:33:58,877 --> 00:33:59,357
[SPEAKER_03]: will be added.

326
00:33:59,677 --> 00:34:07,879
[SPEAKER_03]: It will create a really nice central shaded courtyard area formed by that L-shaped building with the focal point of that existing tree.

327
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:15,841
[SPEAKER_03]: But in order to keep that patio area more or less level, we need to add a small retaining wall along its left side.

328
00:34:16,822 --> 00:34:21,043
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just about two feet tall to help mitigate the slope that

329
00:34:21,783 --> 00:34:24,384
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, goes down the corner of the property there.

330
00:34:25,324 --> 00:34:38,470
[SPEAKER_03]: And while we're maintaining the historic front door and there are some steps to access the house from along Winchester, the primary entry will be an accessible route from the Albion side of things going in through the courtyard there as Peter is indicating.

331
00:34:40,410 --> 00:34:46,712
[SPEAKER_03]: The final piece of the project is this proposed pocket park that we've designed at the corner of Winchester and Albion.

332
00:34:47,613 --> 00:34:58,437
[SPEAKER_03]: We had originally tried to design a semi-circular sort of like a little shortcut through the corner with some benches, but because the slope changes from one sidewalk to the other, it would be too steep.

333
00:34:59,257 --> 00:35:07,744
[SPEAKER_03]: So instead we created a more contained and enclosed green space with these three benches that you see positioned along the backside.

334
00:35:07,764 --> 00:35:18,613
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can sit within this little mini paved patio area and you can watch the intersection or people coming and going on the sidewalk in a nice green space.

335
00:35:20,635 --> 00:35:22,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we can go to the next slide and take a look at some plantings.

336
00:35:25,157 --> 00:35:30,642
[SPEAKER_03]: This is our overall planting plan that provides a full plant list in the center there.

337
00:35:30,662 --> 00:35:39,549
[SPEAKER_03]: What you'll note is our plantings rely heavily or the selections rely heavily on native or native adapted species.

338
00:35:39,589 --> 00:35:50,457
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're very drought tolerant, trying to support biodiversity, very hardy and low maintenance as well as trying to provide four seasons of interest.

339
00:35:51,478 --> 00:35:56,280
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have things like surface berry trees, sugar maples, hornbeams, summer sweet, that kind of thing.

340
00:35:58,581 --> 00:36:11,047
[SPEAKER_03]: Lastly, the last page shows some details, which we don't need to get into the nitty gritty, but if anyone has any questions, there's some details associated with the landscape, like for those checker block pavers and the unit paving and planting details.

341
00:36:12,534 --> 00:36:16,337
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, that's all I have, but I'm happy to answer questions.

342
00:36:16,877 --> 00:36:23,141
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we should run through the traffic and civil engineering design that David will share.

343
00:36:23,441 --> 00:36:23,782
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

344
00:36:23,902 --> 00:36:24,102
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

345
00:36:24,842 --> 00:36:25,563
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks, Katja.

346
00:36:25,823 --> 00:36:33,128
[SPEAKER_07]: And now we're going to pass it on to David Giangrande from GM2, representing both the civil design and the traffic.

347
00:36:34,509 --> 00:36:35,790
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll bring up the drawings, David.

348
00:36:39,112 --> 00:36:39,432
[SPEAKER_07]: There you are.

349
00:36:42,404 --> 00:36:43,504
[SPEAKER_07]: You may be muted, I think.

350
00:36:43,524 --> 00:36:44,524
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me see.

351
00:36:50,626 --> 00:36:51,126
[SPEAKER_07]: You're muted.

352
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:54,846
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, could you just, could you raise his hand?

353
00:36:54,866 --> 00:36:59,267
[SPEAKER_13]: That'll help us find, or say his name again, and I'll- David, David Giangrande.

354
00:36:59,807 --> 00:37:02,108
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, thank you.

355
00:37:06,249 --> 00:37:08,349
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think it's his first rodeo in Medford either.

356
00:37:09,802 --> 00:37:10,602
[SPEAKER_07]: But maybe on Zoom.

357
00:37:10,622 --> 00:37:11,022
[SPEAKER_07]: There we go.

358
00:37:11,442 --> 00:37:16,504
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I clicked the Ask to Unmute, and I can try it one more time.

359
00:37:16,544 --> 00:37:17,164
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to click.

360
00:37:20,344 --> 00:37:22,485
[SPEAKER_07]: You may have to unmute, David, yourself.

361
00:37:23,525 --> 00:37:25,406
[SPEAKER_01]: The host and participants are unmuted.

362
00:37:25,586 --> 00:37:26,246
[SPEAKER_07]: There you are now.

363
00:37:26,266 --> 00:37:28,166
[SPEAKER_07]: Now we hear you mobile.

364
00:37:28,686 --> 00:37:29,686
[SPEAKER_01]: Can everybody hear me?

365
00:37:30,627 --> 00:37:30,847
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

366
00:37:31,267 --> 00:37:31,487
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.

367
00:37:32,471 --> 00:37:41,979
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm David, I'm with GM 2 and we're responsible for the civil and traffic transportation piece of this project.

368
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:50,495
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll first talk a little bit about the civil aspects and this site plan that we have up in front of us.

369
00:37:50,996 --> 00:37:53,618
[SPEAKER_01]: This happens to be the existing condition plan.

370
00:37:54,598 --> 00:37:58,922
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think a lot has been said about the topography.

371
00:37:59,262 --> 00:38:02,805
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we look at a site, initially we start looking at

372
00:38:03,305 --> 00:38:05,706
[SPEAKER_01]: the topography and the constraints.

373
00:38:06,046 --> 00:38:13,667
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, in this particular case, our constraints are Winchester Street and Alfred Street and Albion Street.

374
00:38:14,047 --> 00:38:16,188
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have some abutting properties.

375
00:38:16,228 --> 00:38:21,309
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want to respect those properties when we're looking at things such as grading and drainage.

376
00:38:21,949 --> 00:38:25,410
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll focus predominantly the civil part of this presentation

377
00:38:27,011 --> 00:38:33,920
[SPEAKER_01]: On grading and drainage and what we've what we've done and how we're going to manage that.

378
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,021
[SPEAKER_01]: Peter, can you go to C103 please?

379
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:38,851
[SPEAKER_01]: Fantastic.

380
00:38:39,131 --> 00:38:39,812
[SPEAKER_01]: This is actually 102.

381
00:38:40,032 --> 00:38:42,274
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you go to 103?

382
00:38:43,335 --> 00:38:43,695
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.

383
00:38:44,016 --> 00:38:46,238
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

384
00:38:46,778 --> 00:38:53,584
[SPEAKER_01]: So as we said on the left side where Winchester Street is, we have an elevation of around almost 44.

385
00:38:54,585 --> 00:38:55,086
[SPEAKER_01]: Elevation 44.

386
00:38:55,806 --> 00:39:02,692
[SPEAKER_01]: But as we go through the site, we drop almost eight feet to an elevation of about

387
00:39:04,334 --> 00:39:06,335
[SPEAKER_01]: 36 on Alfred Street.

388
00:39:06,915 --> 00:39:13,499
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of talk has been, there's been a discussion about how we segmented the driveways, et cetera.

389
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:21,164
[SPEAKER_01]: All of that is important in how we're gonna handle our drainage and runoff and protect the abutting properties.

390
00:39:22,525 --> 00:39:31,150
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we've done is we've started with trying to take and emulate the existing condition plan that we just saw earlier.

391
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:58,235
[SPEAKER_01]: and well what we do is what we we're taking with the drainage we're taking the the drainage from the roofs etc towards winchester street on the left hand side so if you look closely um just in front of the building and adjacent to winchester street there's two very large tanks we're gonna we're gonna uh infiltrate much of the clean roof water back into the um

392
00:39:59,195 --> 00:40:00,396
[SPEAKER_01]: back into the aquifer.

393
00:40:00,857 --> 00:40:14,792
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to always keep moisture in the soil and so it's very important on any site and it's part of stormwater regulations that we actually infiltrate water back into the natural aquifer.

394
00:40:16,867 --> 00:40:24,091
[SPEAKER_01]: Also connecting to that, if you look at the driveway on that north side, can you zoom up there a little bit, Peter?

395
00:40:24,131 --> 00:40:24,592
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

396
00:40:25,973 --> 00:40:36,239
[SPEAKER_01]: What we've done is we've got two trench drains, one at Alfred Street and also one at the driveway entrance.

397
00:40:36,279 --> 00:40:42,843
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you look at the one to the far right on Alfred Street, we've connected that to its own infiltration system.

398
00:40:43,603 --> 00:40:43,863
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?

399
00:40:44,024 --> 00:40:55,776
[SPEAKER_01]: So that again, we're maintaining discharge of that groundwater back into the areas where it always absorbed.

400
00:40:56,817 --> 00:41:00,281
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you scan to the left a little bit, Peter, towards Winchester Street?

401
00:41:01,448 --> 00:41:10,152
[SPEAKER_01]: In order to stop water from running down the driveway and into the basement, into the parking garage, we have a trench drain.

402
00:41:10,872 --> 00:41:27,639
[SPEAKER_01]: And because it's gone down eight feet, we have to lift it up to, so what you see there in that larger box is a trench drain connected to a pump station and pumps it up to the left where we have a particle separator where we clean the water.

403
00:41:28,259 --> 00:41:31,542
[SPEAKER_01]: before we put it back into the tanks out front.

404
00:41:32,463 --> 00:41:39,329
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's important that we always balance flows.

405
00:41:39,449 --> 00:41:43,192
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had a certain flow that was going towards Winchester Street.

406
00:41:43,632 --> 00:41:49,197
[SPEAKER_01]: We have large tanks so that we can balance what still goes out to Winchester Street.

407
00:41:49,698 --> 00:41:51,559
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we've done here.

408
00:41:53,561 --> 00:42:01,907
[SPEAKER_01]: The other piece I want to look at is there's another infiltration for the smaller building.

409
00:42:01,967 --> 00:42:13,816
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look in and around that pocket park, what we'll do is before they do all of the beautiful landscape, we'll get in there and we'll do another small infiltration system there.

410
00:42:14,336 --> 00:42:27,328
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, most of these infiltration systems have an overflow to the system, and what we're doing is we're balancing flows that run out where they always ran, and we hold the rest and we infiltrate it in.

411
00:42:30,078 --> 00:42:32,559
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the drainage in a nutshell.

412
00:42:33,039 --> 00:42:49,304
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, taking the clean roof water, delivering it to the infiltration systems, taking the site water and sending it through particle separators and again, delivering to the infiltration system and then having an overflow.

413
00:42:50,848 --> 00:42:54,529
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the drainage in a nutshell.

414
00:42:55,149 --> 00:43:01,051
[SPEAKER_01]: The other utilities that are vital on something like this, a large building, we're going to need fire suppression, right?

415
00:43:01,091 --> 00:43:05,412
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll take the fire suppression off of Winchester Street.

416
00:43:06,152 --> 00:43:08,893
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in the middle of the site there.

417
00:43:11,253 --> 00:43:15,054
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still on that 103, should be.

418
00:43:15,554 --> 00:43:17,015
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right to the top of the screen.

419
00:43:17,818 --> 00:43:25,804
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll bring domestic and fire suppression lines in from Winchester Street.

420
00:43:27,626 --> 00:43:38,494
[SPEAKER_01]: And we will also bring our sewer out and stormwater connections to Winchester Street for the bulk of this sewer overflow.

421
00:43:38,835 --> 00:43:40,156
[SPEAKER_01]: Now for the smaller building,

422
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:48,884
[SPEAKER_01]: we'd like to try to utilize, if possible, the existing sewer connection.

423
00:43:48,924 --> 00:43:59,789
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we'll do, and we've spoken to engineering about this, and we've got some comments that I'll go over in a minute relative to the sewer and water and drain.

424
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:03,912
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we'd like to do is use the sewer line if we can.

425
00:44:04,472 --> 00:44:09,755
[SPEAKER_01]: So in order to do that, what we typically do is we'll video it as part of the process.

426
00:44:10,335 --> 00:44:17,820
[SPEAKER_01]: So these plans are vetted so that we can identify all of the big pieces.

427
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:30,507
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's a lot of nuance that we'll have to continue to work with the engineering staff to work out as we go towards building permit if we're successful here.

428
00:44:31,893 --> 00:44:38,579
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so what we'll do is we'll video that sewer line for the small and if we have to, we'll put in a new sewer line.

429
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:42,443
[SPEAKER_01]: We do know that there's a 3 quarter inch.

430
00:44:42,523 --> 00:44:46,767
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe there's a 3 quarter inch lead line service going into that.

431
00:44:46,927 --> 00:44:49,570
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll probably have to figure out.

432
00:44:50,671 --> 00:45:03,933
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to change out the lead line, obviously, and the building's expanding a little bit, so we'll be increasing the size and want to change out the lead surface, so we'll probably change the water to that building.

433
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:08,983
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's water, electricity.

434
00:45:10,084 --> 00:45:18,532
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the center of the core, we always wanna identify where we think we can fit a transformer in early in the process.

435
00:45:18,933 --> 00:45:29,403
[SPEAKER_01]: Although we don't have all the control over that, we'll go to the various, we'll go to the electric company and we'll work with electric and communications and we'll,

436
00:45:30,784 --> 00:45:32,066
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll work through the process.

437
00:45:32,126 --> 00:45:35,410
[SPEAKER_01]: We are proposing a transformer in the center of the site.

438
00:45:36,872 --> 00:45:37,633
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um.

439
00:45:38,951 --> 00:45:49,621
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's pretty much drainage, grading, utilities, and I'd be happy to ask, you know, if you have any questions, I'd be happy to answer what I can.

440
00:45:51,002 --> 00:45:55,346
[SPEAKER_01]: The next piece I want to discuss, if that's okay, is the traffic.

441
00:45:57,448 --> 00:46:00,731
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we can, do you have the,

442
00:46:03,156 --> 00:46:05,723
[SPEAKER_01]: The area map, sort of the study area map?

443
00:46:06,084 --> 00:46:06,606
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, I did.

444
00:46:07,127 --> 00:46:08,732
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, that would be wonderful.

445
00:46:08,752 --> 00:46:10,697
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me a second to bring that up.

446
00:46:17,702 --> 00:46:38,571
[SPEAKER_01]: So in terms of a traffic study, MassDOT has guidelines in putting together these traffic studies so that the way we do the work is consistent, whether I'm doing it or another traffic engineer is doing it, so that we can, that's great, Peter.

447
00:46:39,818 --> 00:46:53,651
[SPEAKER_01]: So 1 of the 1st things we do before we do much is we meet with the traffic engineer in the town and it's great that you have a traffic engineer Todd Blake.

448
00:46:53,851 --> 00:46:55,292
[SPEAKER_01]: I've known Todd for a long time.

449
00:46:56,573 --> 00:47:11,321
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we sit down and we talk about the site and the extent of how far, are there any issues, et cetera, before we even start digging in and collecting data.

450
00:47:11,401 --> 00:47:14,963
[SPEAKER_01]: We look at it sort of at 30,000 feet.

451
00:47:15,603 --> 00:47:23,848
[SPEAKER_01]: And in this particular case, obviously Winchester Street at Albion and Broadway, that makes sense to do that intersection.

452
00:47:24,608 --> 00:47:32,132
[SPEAKER_01]: The intersection down at Winchester Street and Harvard at the other end, very important near the bridge in St.

453
00:47:33,052 --> 00:47:33,552
[SPEAKER_01]: Clemens.

454
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:40,522
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we talked about, okay, is there a need to do other intersections?

455
00:47:41,082 --> 00:47:50,206
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is a one-way peering, which is Morton to Winchester Street, and then New Bern to Medford Street, right?

456
00:47:50,646 --> 00:47:56,368
[SPEAKER_01]: So we get in having very close relatives on Winchester Street.

457
00:47:56,888 --> 00:48:01,210
[SPEAKER_01]: I was in that neighborhood all the time growing up, and I'm still over there occasionally.

458
00:48:02,381 --> 00:48:09,247
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'd always be cutting down those side streets out towards Main Street and Medford Street.

459
00:48:09,368 --> 00:48:11,610
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was very important we looked at those.

460
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:17,975
[SPEAKER_01]: So we ended up looking at five intersections total, which is what we agreed on.

461
00:48:19,336 --> 00:48:21,878
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was our study area.

462
00:48:21,918 --> 00:48:38,812
[SPEAKER_01]: So the intersections were Broadway at Winchester and in Albion, Harvard in Winchester Street, Morton Ave at Winchester Street, Newbern at Medford Street, and then Alfred at Albion.

463
00:48:41,412 --> 00:48:51,266
[SPEAKER_01]: So, the next phase of putting the other traffic study and maybe I'm being a little long winded and I'll try to pick up the pace here is collecting data.

464
00:48:51,506 --> 00:48:53,189
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to look at everything.

465
00:48:53,229 --> 00:48:54,911
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to do a field inventory.

466
00:48:54,971 --> 00:48:55,612
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to get.

467
00:48:56,913 --> 00:49:09,561
[SPEAKER_01]: ATRs, which are the tubes that you put out in the street and you read all sorts of information from that, including speed, the gaps between vehicles when they're arriving and hitting those tubes.

468
00:49:10,061 --> 00:49:17,025
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very important on an unsignalized intersection to understand, can somebody choose a gap to pull out in traffic?

469
00:49:17,465 --> 00:49:24,970
[SPEAKER_01]: We look at signage and striping and parking and the width of the road and the sidewalks and collect all sorts of data.

470
00:49:25,770 --> 00:49:33,536
[SPEAKER_01]: So we then did that, collected all that data, including crash data.

471
00:49:34,597 --> 00:49:37,539
[SPEAKER_01]: When it relates to the crash data, we do three years.

472
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:45,705
[SPEAKER_01]: There's sort of a delay in collecting accident data because it's always lag time.

473
00:49:46,305 --> 00:49:49,208
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did collect three years of, I think it was 2019, 20, and 21.

474
00:49:53,070 --> 00:50:00,772
[SPEAKER_01]: found out that three of the intersections were way, way below the average crash rate.

475
00:50:01,192 --> 00:50:19,037
[SPEAKER_01]: There were two intersections we really wanted to look at, and I think they were pinpointed through the neighborhood in talking with Todd, and that was New Bern and Morton Streets, those intersections at Winchester and at

476
00:50:21,514 --> 00:50:23,995
[SPEAKER_01]: at Medford Street.

477
00:50:24,676 --> 00:50:27,197
[SPEAKER_01]: So we looked at that.

478
00:50:27,277 --> 00:50:38,423
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually did a crash analysis on those locations because we wanted to find out if you look at it and see if there's a bias.

479
00:50:38,563 --> 00:50:42,825
[SPEAKER_01]: Are the conditions creating potential accidents?

480
00:50:43,445 --> 00:50:53,529
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not grossly over the average statewide or district average crash rate, but they're slightly elevated.

481
00:50:53,569 --> 00:51:01,592
[SPEAKER_01]: So we looked at a number of things, and we're going to talk about that in a minute, about what can be done at those locations.

482
00:51:02,546 --> 00:51:13,589
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next part is we start looking at how will the proposed project impact roadway traffic.

483
00:51:13,649 --> 00:51:21,610
[SPEAKER_01]: But before we do that, we do an analysis, a capacity analysis of the existing conditions.

484
00:51:22,111 --> 00:51:27,412
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we do a second analysis at the design year, which is seven years forward.

485
00:51:28,792 --> 00:51:39,156
[SPEAKER_01]: which happened to be, we authored this report and collected the data in 20, I think that the design year is 27, 2027.

486
00:51:40,857 --> 00:51:54,283
[SPEAKER_01]: And we do a growth rate to say, okay, if we didn't do a project, how much additional traffic will happen just by organic growth or planned projects?

487
00:51:55,827 --> 00:52:02,551
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure at that time we went to Alicia or Danielle and said, hey, do you guys have any projects on the horizon?

488
00:52:02,592 --> 00:52:08,916
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked to engineering any projects in the neighborhood that would impact and we would add trips to that as well.

489
00:52:09,456 --> 00:52:12,978
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we did then we did we did the existing conditions analysis.

490
00:52:13,058 --> 00:52:13,599
[SPEAKER_01]: We did the.

491
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:34,355
[SPEAKER_01]: We did the no-build design year analysis, and both of them showed only one real capacity issue as an existing condition, and that was the intersection at Winchester Street and Harvard Street.

492
00:52:37,913 --> 00:52:45,579
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, because you come out to the end of Winchester Street, you've got often traffic going underneath the bridge and backed up at the set of lights.

493
00:52:46,099 --> 00:52:52,004
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a difficult area to negotiate.

494
00:52:52,424 --> 00:52:57,047
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you also have a lot of cut through traffic, which again, we'll talk about.

495
00:52:57,888 --> 00:52:58,389
[SPEAKER_01]: in a minute.

496
00:52:58,489 --> 00:53:20,128
[SPEAKER_01]: So we get these levels of service for an unsignalized intersection ranked from A to F, an A being less than 5 seconds per vehicle of delay, 10 seconds per vehicle of delay, and F is greater than 50 seconds of delay per vehicle.

497
00:53:20,909 --> 00:53:34,162
[SPEAKER_01]: So that intersection coming off of Winchester is at a level of service E in the existing, F in the no build, right?

498
00:53:34,202 --> 00:53:35,884
[SPEAKER_01]: So we haven't even done a project yet.

499
00:53:37,786 --> 00:53:43,851
[SPEAKER_01]: The next thing we do is we look at, okay, what's our project going to generate for traffic?

500
00:53:44,744 --> 00:54:02,197
[SPEAKER_01]: So we go to the IT land use codes and the trip generation manual, and we figure out that, OK, we're going to have residential units, low rise, plus we're going to have some commercial space.

501
00:54:02,877 --> 00:54:08,141
[SPEAKER_01]: We put that all together and figure out what our trips are.

502
00:54:08,521 --> 00:54:10,643
[SPEAKER_01]: But those aren't our actual trips.

503
00:54:10,703 --> 00:54:13,305
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are just trips from the subject site.

504
00:54:14,085 --> 00:54:31,946
[SPEAKER_01]: They could be trips for a single occupancy vehicle, carpool, they could be walking or bicycle, or they could be work from home trips, and most important, transit trips.

505
00:54:32,867 --> 00:54:37,073
[SPEAKER_01]: So then we make an adjustment for using the census track data.

506
00:54:37,594 --> 00:54:49,050
[SPEAKER_01]: We use that census track data to adjust those trips to vehicle trips because what we're really doing is we're analyzing the impact of vehicular trips on the adjacent roadway network.

507
00:54:49,872 --> 00:54:50,112
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?

508
00:54:50,252 --> 00:54:57,279
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this particular case, and I think it was mentioned in Todd's comments, that we were very conservative.

509
00:54:57,840 --> 00:55:05,748
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're conservative because really we're using census track data that is four or five years old, right?

510
00:55:06,328 --> 00:55:08,831
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we've got a brand new,

511
00:55:11,152 --> 00:55:16,555
[SPEAKER_01]: T Station right in Ball Square, so less than a quarter mile away.

512
00:55:16,695 --> 00:55:27,660
[SPEAKER_01]: So the attractiveness of living there and not having an automobile or using transit is one of the reasons why you make a choice to live there.

513
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:33,022
[SPEAKER_01]: So we developed a fairly conservative

514
00:55:36,964 --> 00:55:55,472
[SPEAKER_01]: the amount of new trips, new net trips, and the total net trips were, let's see, total new net trips are 19 new net trips in the morning, 24 new net trips in the p.m.

515
00:55:55,652 --> 00:55:58,053
[SPEAKER_01]: peak, and 225 net trips in the p.m.

516
00:55:58,133 --> 00:55:58,414
[SPEAKER_01]: peak.

517
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:11,042
[SPEAKER_01]: So then what we do is we lay those on our capacity analysis and we review it.

518
00:56:11,262 --> 00:56:20,706
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically, when you're looking at 19 or 24 peak hour trips, that's a very low amount of trips.

519
00:56:20,766 --> 00:56:24,408
[SPEAKER_01]: So we knew we weren't going to have real capacity issues.

520
00:56:25,759 --> 00:56:32,503
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically, all of the intersections stayed very consistent.

521
00:56:32,543 --> 00:56:35,605
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a comparison here that you can see.

522
00:56:36,166 --> 00:56:42,831
[SPEAKER_01]: And highlighted in yellow is that intersection of Harvard Street and Winchester Street.

523
00:56:43,211 --> 00:56:45,833
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a level of service F with the site.

524
00:56:45,953 --> 00:56:48,935
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a level of service F without the site.

525
00:56:49,395 --> 00:56:50,816
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to say it was a level of service.

526
00:56:50,836 --> 00:56:52,097
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going by memory right now.

527
00:56:53,658 --> 00:56:54,619
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

528
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:57,260
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the no build condition.

529
00:56:58,781 --> 00:57:05,344
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, I believe, a level of service E under the existing condition today.

530
00:57:05,944 --> 00:57:10,926
[SPEAKER_01]: So even it went to level of service F even without the site.

531
00:57:12,067 --> 00:57:15,549
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the 2022 existing conditions.

532
00:57:15,729 --> 00:57:15,869
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

533
00:57:19,624 --> 00:57:21,004
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see, what else do I have?

534
00:57:21,345 --> 00:57:23,825
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple other things I did want to go over.

535
00:57:24,746 --> 00:57:41,491
[SPEAKER_01]: So as I had mentioned earlier, there was a review by Todd, Todd Blake, and it did mention the two streets, that there are issues there now and there should be some mitigation.

536
00:57:41,551 --> 00:57:44,632
[SPEAKER_01]: So he has recommended some mitigation.

537
00:57:45,993 --> 00:57:49,254
[SPEAKER_01]: Just look at that traffic mitigation.

538
00:57:50,352 --> 00:58:10,731
[SPEAKER_01]: So for traffic mitigation, he's looking to do or wants as part of this, would like to see as part of this project, some stop bars down at those two intersections we discussed earlier.

539
00:58:12,252 --> 00:58:20,174
[SPEAKER_01]: and also some additional signage, maybe pulling back some of the parking in close proximity to the corner.

540
00:58:20,715 --> 00:58:33,138
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, you know, anybody that drives in this environment, you come to a stop and then you've got to inch out because you've got cars parked in close proximity to get a proper sight distance.

541
00:58:35,127 --> 00:58:43,873
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, he's also looking for a MUTCD stop sign warrant analysis.

542
00:58:44,214 --> 00:58:45,034
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a heavy lift.

543
00:58:47,496 --> 00:58:49,918
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fairly routine to do.

544
00:58:50,578 --> 00:58:56,562
[SPEAKER_01]: And he also was looking so that these vehicles that are parking close to the corners do not

545
00:58:57,783 --> 00:59:01,227
[SPEAKER_01]: continue to encroach on the intersection.

546
00:59:01,647 --> 00:59:20,427
[SPEAKER_01]: He's looking for some pavement markings that would identify in a different color maybe a bump out and maybe put some delineators or commonly referred to the baseball bats around those areas so that the cars won't park right up to the corner.

547
00:59:21,623 --> 00:59:28,683
[SPEAKER_01]: So, the other thing on any site like this, it's important to do some traffic demand management having a.

548
00:59:33,155 --> 00:59:57,483
[SPEAKER_01]: a meeting once a year to discuss modal options, anything that changes, identifying all of the, having in the community space or in the lobby, identifying the bus routes, what's available so that there's just this information available to people that live there and want to

549
00:59:58,283 --> 01:00:02,390
[SPEAKER_01]: want to partake in the transit use.

550
01:00:04,709 --> 01:00:09,351
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and structurally, I didn't talk about bicycles.

551
01:00:10,011 --> 01:00:11,672
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was brought up earlier.

552
01:00:12,533 --> 01:00:21,497
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got ample bike, secured bike racks and in convenient locations.

553
01:00:21,877 --> 01:00:33,502
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is also a very important concept while you're looking at, you know, reducing trips and making the network efficient.

554
01:00:35,622 --> 01:00:40,205
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to say that I covered most of what I wanted to cover.

555
01:00:41,106 --> 01:00:47,771
[SPEAKER_01]: I did also get some comments from the engineers relative to the civil stuff.

556
01:00:48,952 --> 01:01:01,502
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of it is information that we would work through the process as we're going through to the next level of plans.

557
01:01:03,722 --> 01:01:09,605
[SPEAKER_01]: If we are making any changes to the drainage report, they want a new drainage report issued.

558
01:01:10,986 --> 01:01:19,411
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a curb cut on Alfred Street that they wanted to make sure that we're putting new curbing in there.

559
01:01:22,112 --> 01:01:23,733
[SPEAKER_01]: The video that I mentioned earlier,

560
01:01:26,346 --> 01:01:39,409
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I think that all of the comments we've received to date are very valid comments and can be easily incorporated into our plans in our work.

561
01:01:39,550 --> 01:01:52,533
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that, I'm gonna turn it back over to Peter, I would assume, and we can answer questions or... Actually, back to Adam.

562
01:01:54,085 --> 01:01:58,013
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're happy to answer any questions, as David said, both teams still here.

563
01:01:58,774 --> 01:02:01,179
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, that concludes the initial presentation.

564
01:02:01,219 --> 01:02:06,328
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that was a lot to digest, but yeah, happy to answer any questions the board has.

565
01:02:06,388 --> 01:02:06,649
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

566
01:02:10,776 --> 01:02:12,397
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you all for your presentation.

567
01:02:12,517 --> 01:02:20,483
[SPEAKER_17]: I do have some clarifying questions, but I think they'll probably be better fleshed out as we go through the department head comments, because there are plenty.

568
01:02:21,404 --> 01:02:30,611
[SPEAKER_17]: I was looking at the traffic and you had mentioned that there was a level of service F, which is the worst of the levels.

569
01:02:32,483 --> 01:02:39,247
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm trying to wrap my head around the mitigation that you were trying to explain for that.

570
01:02:39,527 --> 01:02:48,573
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm trying to see what the level of service F had to do in regards to the mitigation that was suggested by the traffic engineer.

571
01:02:49,180 --> 01:02:59,845
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, I think it's important to identify that the level of service F was during it was engaged at the no build situation.

572
01:03:00,445 --> 01:03:04,267
[SPEAKER_01]: So, even if there's no further development.

573
01:03:06,564 --> 01:03:16,207
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to end up with a level of service F at that intersection and, you know, within that design period, which was a seven year horizon, right?

574
01:03:16,467 --> 01:03:19,948
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're at a level of service F, even if there is no site.

575
01:03:20,888 --> 01:03:20,988
[SPEAKER_01]: And

576
01:03:23,144 --> 01:03:28,891
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just, you know, we're putting a handful of additional trips there.

577
01:03:28,931 --> 01:03:34,837
[SPEAKER_01]: So it just continues to be an F. There was no mitigation there in particular.

578
01:03:34,857 --> 01:03:35,538
[SPEAKER_01]: It's.

579
01:03:38,329 --> 01:03:46,271
[SPEAKER_01]: The mitigation really was more to do with speeding along Winchester Street.

580
01:03:46,331 --> 01:03:49,753
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that that was his primary concern.

581
01:03:50,233 --> 01:03:57,355
[SPEAKER_01]: And also accidents at the two corners off of Moulton and

582
01:04:00,593 --> 01:04:01,714
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

583
01:04:01,974 --> 01:04:03,454
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.

584
01:04:04,634 --> 01:04:10,436
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me, Morton Ave at Winchester Street and New Bern at Medford Street.

585
01:04:11,176 --> 01:04:17,718
[SPEAKER_01]: So the mitigation was more in line with creating a safe environment for

586
01:04:20,222 --> 01:04:26,706
[SPEAKER_01]: for the pedestrian, for the bicyclist, for the motorist.

587
01:04:27,027 --> 01:04:28,868
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what his mitigation was based on.

588
01:04:29,428 --> 01:04:40,375
[SPEAKER_01]: He also did mention mitigation that included pavement markings for a potential bike lane on Albion Street as well in his comments.

589
01:04:41,792 --> 01:04:51,487
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that everybody knows that in order to create capacity at an intersection, we need to add lanes.

590
01:04:52,778 --> 01:04:55,459
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't add lanes in an urban environment.

591
01:04:55,799 --> 01:05:02,102
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we are trying to do is encourage other modes of transportation.

592
01:05:02,602 --> 01:05:05,643
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where the traffic demand management comes in.

593
01:05:05,683 --> 01:05:07,144
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where the bike lane comes in.

594
01:05:07,584 --> 01:05:20,269
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where supporting and advertising the transit availability comes into play here.

595
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:37,293
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would say also in our numbers, even though it was only 25 trips in the AM of 19 and 25, something like that, which is minor, minor, small amount of trips, that was conservative.

596
01:05:38,675 --> 01:05:44,300
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason why it was conservative is because we were using old, older census that we had.

597
01:05:44,661 --> 01:05:47,063
[SPEAKER_01]: We use what was available, the older census data.

598
01:05:47,523 --> 01:05:56,051
[SPEAKER_01]: The census data doesn't consider that we now have a major transit hub right within a quarter mile.

599
01:05:57,492 --> 01:06:12,446
[SPEAKER_01]: So sometimes what we'll do is we'll make further adjustments in our analysis, but we put forward this conservative, and I think Todd mentions that in his review as well.

600
01:06:16,948 --> 01:06:17,990
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for clarifying.

601
01:06:18,010 --> 01:06:27,766
[SPEAKER_17]: I just want to clarify my inquiry was that I understand that the no build scenario, but however, it's like, it's you create.

602
01:06:29,502 --> 01:06:39,085
[SPEAKER_17]: no matter how many new cars you add to that intersection, it's still creating, it's adding to the instability of that breakneck point, right?

603
01:06:39,125 --> 01:06:53,230
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's like, just like if you were on, I don't know, intersection 495, whether you build something new, intersection 495 is going to always be unstable at a loss of F. And I just want to know what were the other scenarios that you would do to create mitigation for that?

604
01:06:55,247 --> 01:06:56,147
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm sorry.

605
01:06:56,207 --> 01:07:01,309
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't fully understand that.

606
01:07:01,589 --> 01:07:14,134
[SPEAKER_01]: You're very, very limited with the unsignalized intersection right up against that bridge abutment right there and then the intersection a little bit further down.

607
01:07:15,435 --> 01:07:20,917
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not something we can, oh, we can just add a little lane here or do something like that.

608
01:07:21,017 --> 01:07:23,238
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would take a major study.

609
01:07:25,036 --> 01:07:25,556
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

610
01:07:26,397 --> 01:07:26,677
[SPEAKER_17]: Peter?

611
01:07:26,697 --> 01:07:30,420
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks.

612
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:42,268
[SPEAKER_12]: Just as a member of the board and as a practicing traffic engineer who's been on the other side a couple of days, just to kind of further explain some of Jackie's concern.

613
01:07:42,328 --> 01:07:52,836
[SPEAKER_12]: A lot of those type of intersections, like the Harvard at Winchester intersection that are those two-way stop controlled, when you encounter those kind of conditions,

614
01:07:55,753 --> 01:08:09,240
[SPEAKER_12]: You are going to see a low service F in a lot of conditions, even when it's not that bad, because it does show a lot of delay at the stop control.

615
01:08:09,300 --> 01:08:12,362
[SPEAKER_12]: Because in that case, Harvard Street doesn't have to stop.

616
01:08:13,543 --> 01:08:18,545
[SPEAKER_12]: So it doesn't take a lot to get to that F just in the modeling.

617
01:08:18,865 --> 01:08:20,066
[SPEAKER_12]: And someone just had to do a lot of it.

618
01:08:22,948 --> 01:08:23,508
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Peter.

619
01:08:24,381 --> 01:08:24,921
[SPEAKER_12]: No problem.

620
01:08:24,941 --> 01:08:45,575
[SPEAKER_12]: Just wanted to, as someone who understands where the traffic numbers came from, kind of show how that works, and especially how it can look really bad at those kind of intersections, just because the stop sign controlled legs will look really bad, even though there's usually not that many cars waiting there.

621
01:08:46,616 --> 01:08:47,617
[SPEAKER_17]: OK.

622
01:08:47,637 --> 01:08:48,077
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

623
01:08:52,303 --> 01:08:54,732
[SPEAKER_17]: Do any other board members have clarifying questions?

624
01:09:11,077 --> 01:09:20,525
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, so I actually I'm not sure if there's so we this public comments and I just want to remind public or actually I haven't read it.

625
01:09:21,646 --> 01:09:26,730
[SPEAKER_17]: I am not able to put on record anything that's sent to me and by chat.

626
01:09:26,770 --> 01:09:28,491
[SPEAKER_17]: So please do not use the chat feature.

627
01:09:29,152 --> 01:09:30,673
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'll open up the public comment now.

628
01:09:30,733 --> 01:09:32,654
[SPEAKER_17]: So anyone has comments, they can speak.

629
01:09:35,199 --> 01:09:40,341
[SPEAKER_17]: Those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature or message Alicia in the comments.

630
01:09:40,381 --> 01:09:44,543
[SPEAKER_17]: You can also send an email to OCD at Medford-MA.gov.

631
01:09:45,023 --> 01:09:48,245
[SPEAKER_17]: Before providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record.

632
01:09:48,665 --> 01:09:55,448
[SPEAKER_17]: A reminder to all meeting participants to please refrain from using the chat function to provide comments as it is not part of the public record.

633
01:09:55,888 --> 01:10:02,651
[SPEAKER_17]: However, if a participant is having audio or other technical difficulties, this may be entered into the chat to alert myself and staff.

634
01:10:05,657 --> 01:10:13,319
[SPEAKER_17]: And depending on how many people we have, how many commenters, I will determine the limit.

635
01:10:15,299 --> 01:10:17,960
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll start with three minutes per comment.

636
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:25,322
[SPEAKER_17]: And I see the first hand Martha, and I believe Martha, you're the one who has sent a message, so you can go first.

637
01:10:29,011 --> 01:10:34,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, hi, Martha McPartland, 8 Alfred Street, so directly across from this.

638
01:10:37,957 --> 01:10:52,947
[SPEAKER_04]: Understanding, this is a question directly to the architects, understanding that this building will be a dramatic change to our neighborhood, will increase the population of our very quiet, small neighborhood by times 100.

639
01:10:57,182 --> 01:11:11,065
[SPEAKER_04]: Why on earth would you include a party deck on top of this building directly across the street from several quiet single family homes?

640
01:11:12,185 --> 01:11:20,787
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure how more squarely to put this, but I will continue to fight this project, including leveraging the multiple

641
01:11:22,044 --> 01:11:29,906
[SPEAKER_04]: lawyers in my family that I can get for free to work on this till the end of time, until that roof deck, party deck is gone.

642
01:11:30,607 --> 01:11:31,987
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't understand why it has to be there.

643
01:11:32,007 --> 01:11:40,730
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems an insult to the neighborhood, given how much louder this thing is going to make our neighborhood with another 150 people in it.

644
01:11:41,770 --> 01:11:46,331
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody, every unit having a deck, traffic and everything else.

645
01:11:46,672 --> 01:11:49,653
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an insult that you would put a party deck on top of this as well.

646
01:11:50,173 --> 01:11:51,073
[SPEAKER_04]: Please explain yourself.

647
01:11:58,379 --> 01:12:04,684
[SPEAKER_07]: The idea is that a building of this size needs to provide a certain level of amenities for its tenants.

648
01:12:05,805 --> 01:12:11,389
[SPEAKER_07]: And one of those, of course, is, you know, it's a roof deck.

649
01:12:12,050 --> 01:12:15,092
[SPEAKER_07]: You call it a party deck, that's a management question.

650
01:12:15,112 --> 01:12:19,435
[SPEAKER_07]: A deck like this would not just be a free-for-all.

651
01:12:20,976 --> 01:12:27,061
[SPEAKER_07]: It would have to go through building management for anybody to have a party, and something like that could be controlled.

652
01:12:28,270 --> 01:12:36,497
[SPEAKER_07]: We've also enclosed it in a six foot high screening, which could have some acoustical treatment if needed.

653
01:12:37,478 --> 01:12:42,261
[SPEAKER_07]: But for the most part, you know, we found in all the projects we've done, these kinds of roof decks are really just kind of for

654
01:12:43,262 --> 01:13:11,214
[SPEAKER_07]: small groups that you know want to have a picnic or um you know a family that wants to get outside maybe do a little bit of playing and um and um and uh have a picnic or you know something like that so it's not i don't know i think it's a little bit of a broadside to call it a party deck but i understand your concern um that's not its purpose actually um so i i think you know that that's something that uh

655
01:13:11,934 --> 01:13:33,032
[SPEAKER_07]: The occupancy of it will probably be limited to, you would not see anywhere near all the people in the building out there, probably more like, you know, 20, 30 people at any one time at the most, and more likely, you know, just half a dozen people in various furnishing configurations with tables and umbrellas and all that.

656
01:13:34,102 --> 01:13:40,967
[SPEAKER_07]: So I mean, these people who live here would be able to benefit from that.

657
01:13:41,728 --> 01:13:43,749
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't see it making a lot of noise.

658
01:13:44,490 --> 01:13:48,433
[SPEAKER_07]: You do, but I think that's something we'll just have to disagree about.

659
01:13:51,135 --> 01:13:54,717
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's certainly not labeled and intended to be a party deck.

660
01:13:54,737 --> 01:14:00,822
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, that's through the chair.

661
01:14:01,642 --> 01:14:02,203
[SPEAKER_09]: Those comments.

662
01:14:02,223 --> 01:14:02,743
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

663
01:14:04,683 --> 01:14:07,926
[SPEAKER_17]: And anyone on the city, I'm not sure if we receive Ms.

664
01:14:07,946 --> 01:14:11,848
[SPEAKER_17]: Martland's.

665
01:14:14,831 --> 01:14:16,672
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sorry, I believe she has another question.

666
01:14:17,012 --> 01:14:18,413
[SPEAKER_17]: Before we go back to Ms.

667
01:14:18,473 --> 01:14:22,936
[SPEAKER_17]: Martland, is there anyone else that has a question and we will circle right back to you.

668
01:14:22,956 --> 01:14:25,018
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sorry, Ms.

669
01:14:25,038 --> 01:14:29,181
[SPEAKER_17]: McPartland, I apologize for saying your name incorrectly.

670
01:14:34,943 --> 01:14:42,604
[SPEAKER_17]: Alicia, do you see any other comments or if you have anything to read from the queue or previously sent emails or letters?

671
01:14:43,805 --> 01:14:49,066
[SPEAKER_13]: I do not see anything else, anybody else with their hands up.

672
01:14:49,206 --> 01:15:00,188
[SPEAKER_13]: Some people had sent me some direct messages earlier and I had said that there would be a public comment period when they could raise their hands and if they wanted to comment at that time.

673
01:15:01,649 --> 01:15:13,820
[SPEAKER_13]: I will say that if anybody doesn't know how to raise their hands or is having trouble, you can certainly send me a chat and I can send, I can use that to know that you need to unmute.

674
01:15:14,741 --> 01:15:21,467
[SPEAKER_13]: And I will just ask the other staff, does any, I don't see anything in our email box that's come in recently.

675
01:15:22,228 --> 01:15:31,558
[SPEAKER_13]: I just am confirming with Aditi and Clem that there weren't other public comments in a file to read.

676
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:36,003
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, there aren't any public comments in the file.

677
01:15:36,691 --> 01:15:38,833
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, there's nothing new in the email box.

678
01:15:41,035 --> 01:15:56,668
[SPEAKER_13]: Madam Chair, I've been advised by our DEI director that if we don't know somebody's full name or name to just read out exactly what they have written there, I think you have maybe parsed Martha McPartland's name.

679
01:15:57,229 --> 01:15:59,731
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, I believe it's Miss Martha McPartland.

680
01:15:59,811 --> 01:16:04,475
[SPEAKER_17]: And if I have it incorrectly, if you can please unmute her and

681
01:16:07,690 --> 01:16:10,933
[SPEAKER_17]: As you speak, I'm sorry, I'm not sure of your pronouns.

682
01:16:10,993 --> 01:16:11,753
[SPEAKER_17]: I apologize.

683
01:16:11,914 --> 01:16:17,439
[SPEAKER_17]: Please introduce yourself and give your address as well.

684
01:16:18,059 --> 01:16:18,259
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

685
01:16:18,519 --> 01:16:19,981
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, it's Martha McPartland.

686
01:16:20,201 --> 01:16:21,722
[SPEAKER_04]: The address is 8 Alfred Street.

687
01:16:22,723 --> 01:16:24,084
[SPEAKER_04]: To Mr. Quinn, 30 people

688
01:16:25,429 --> 01:16:30,031
[SPEAKER_04]: on your roof deck is more people than live in this neighborhood.

689
01:16:30,632 --> 01:16:33,193
[SPEAKER_04]: So you seem to think that that is not a big deal.

690
01:16:34,014 --> 01:16:38,896
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything out of your mouth is completely qualified by they probably won't or it's up to the management, whatever.

691
01:16:39,636 --> 01:16:40,577
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no way that

692
01:16:41,618 --> 01:16:49,226
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone could tell me with a straight face that someone is making a decision on whether or not to rent or buy here based on whether or not this building includes a roof deck.

693
01:16:49,586 --> 01:16:52,589
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm saying to you that it is going to dramatically harm.

694
01:16:52,609 --> 01:16:55,372
[SPEAKER_04]: It is insult to injury with this.

695
01:16:55,552 --> 01:16:58,275
[SPEAKER_04]: I see this building is going to go through whether we like it or not.

696
01:16:58,595 --> 01:17:00,597
[SPEAKER_04]: It is insult to injury to include that.

697
01:17:02,213 --> 01:17:05,854
[SPEAKER_04]: as because these new people need that amenity.

698
01:17:06,194 --> 01:17:13,475
[SPEAKER_04]: What about the emotional health of this neighborhood based on the potential and likely noise impact of that?

699
01:17:13,495 --> 01:17:17,216
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, forget the whole building, but the noise impact of that deck.

700
01:17:17,336 --> 01:17:30,858
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to understand why you and your team feel that it is critical to include that as part of this plan when you are already putting another 150 residents in a neighborhood that doesn't even have 50 residents in it.

701
01:17:33,203 --> 01:17:37,465
[SPEAKER_04]: Explain to me why that roof deck has to be there.

702
01:17:40,586 --> 01:17:44,868
[SPEAKER_07]: Madam Chair, I don't feel that I can really address these questions.

703
01:17:44,948 --> 01:17:48,690
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, this butter is certainly welcome to.

704
01:17:51,202 --> 01:17:55,228
[SPEAKER_07]: petition to have that removed and see where that goes.

705
01:17:55,248 --> 01:18:05,743
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm responding to a program that was given to me by my client and what we're seeing in the marketplace.

706
01:18:07,303 --> 01:18:11,746
[SPEAKER_10]: Madam Chair, if I may respond, thank you.

707
01:18:11,786 --> 01:18:14,628
[SPEAKER_10]: We do appreciate the feedback on this.

708
01:18:14,688 --> 01:18:26,737
[SPEAKER_10]: I can tell you that in regards to the roof deck, the intent is I think for the roof deck to be utilized in the same fashion as a

709
01:18:27,617 --> 01:18:28,957
[SPEAKER_10]: as a backyard would be.

710
01:18:31,558 --> 01:18:33,979
[SPEAKER_10]: We can certainly speak with our clients.

711
01:18:34,019 --> 01:18:46,122
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know that the time restrictions and those sorts would be best dealt with on this meeting, but I can speak to our client to discuss what their intents are as far as timing.

712
01:18:46,642 --> 01:18:56,345
[SPEAKER_10]: Because certainly, the objective here is not to create a scenario where there is an intensification of use that would bleed into the neighboring properties, particularly during

713
01:18:57,505 --> 01:19:02,107
[SPEAKER_10]: hours where people are sleeping and late at night and things of that sort.

714
01:19:02,127 --> 01:19:14,812
[SPEAKER_10]: So we can certainly talk and inform you of any limitations that we'd be willing to put on that roof deck because the concerns you're raising are certainly, you know, well spoken and

715
01:19:16,112 --> 01:19:20,338
[SPEAKER_10]: and we respect your concerns as a neighbor.

716
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:32,256
[SPEAKER_10]: If we may, let us speak to our clients and the developers and see what they can do with this amenity space to help to address some of the concerns you've raised.

717
01:19:32,912 --> 01:19:35,574
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, I'll be happy to hear the result of that.

718
01:19:35,594 --> 01:19:37,175
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, what they can do, of course, is remove it.

719
01:19:37,295 --> 01:19:41,878
[SPEAKER_04]: It is not necessary to this building is not necessary to sell units or rent units in this building.

720
01:19:41,898 --> 01:19:43,198
[SPEAKER_04]: It is not a necessary feature.

721
01:19:43,378 --> 01:19:44,779
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a, it's an optional feature.

722
01:19:44,799 --> 01:19:47,981
[SPEAKER_04]: I would also say it's like a backyard.

723
01:19:48,402 --> 01:19:50,243
[SPEAKER_04]: If anyone on this call.

724
01:19:51,343 --> 01:20:02,149
[SPEAKER_04]: who is not part of the neighborhood, has ever been to this neighborhood, even during the summer, we all understand that we live in very tight quarters and we're all very respectful of the noise level.

725
01:20:02,529 --> 01:20:08,312
[SPEAKER_04]: No one has anything going on loud in their backyards or especially at night, anything like that.

726
01:20:08,592 --> 01:20:17,317
[SPEAKER_04]: When someone does even have something in their backyard, more often than not, we will go around and tell the neighbors that we're going to have something and to please let us know if it's going to be too loud.

727
01:20:17,697 --> 01:20:18,538
[SPEAKER_04]: You're talking about

728
01:20:19,538 --> 01:20:26,627
[SPEAKER_04]: Adding a backyard that is accessible to probably about 150 people at any time, at any hour.

729
01:20:26,647 --> 01:20:36,379
[SPEAKER_04]: I will not be satisfied by some restriction of plants in front of it, or it won't be accessible after 10pm or 11pm, something like that.

730
01:20:36,459 --> 01:20:37,661
[SPEAKER_04]: That is not going to be...

731
01:20:38,602 --> 01:20:41,204
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you guys are literally, this is just insult to injury.

732
01:20:41,724 --> 01:20:47,407
[SPEAKER_04]: You're putting this in our neighborhood, and then you're putting a cherry on top of this ridiculous roof deck on top.

733
01:20:47,987 --> 01:20:53,390
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not buying that it is critical for this project, its success, or anything else.

734
01:20:53,531 --> 01:20:54,771
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you.

735
01:20:54,811 --> 01:20:56,172
[SPEAKER_04]: Please do take it back to your client.

736
01:20:56,212 --> 01:21:04,197
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I would ask the board if they have any instructions they could provide to me or who I can contact in order to petition its removal in a formal way.

737
01:21:05,072 --> 01:21:08,373
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how to go about doing that, but if someone could let me know, I would appreciate it.

738
01:21:09,033 --> 01:21:09,934
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you so much.

739
01:21:10,454 --> 01:21:14,876
[SPEAKER_17]: I will have, we will have the city follow up with you if you can just hold tight.

740
01:21:15,616 --> 01:21:19,097
[SPEAKER_17]: Alicia, can you please have one of your staff members follow up with Portland?

741
01:21:19,937 --> 01:21:20,558
[SPEAKER_17]: And thank you.

742
01:21:21,998 --> 01:21:25,159
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll have to speak to the applicant to understand what they have in mind.

743
01:21:27,663 --> 01:21:37,548
[SPEAKER_13]: Certainly I will say that there is a, this board tonight is making recommendations to the city council, including recommendations of conditions.

744
01:21:38,088 --> 01:21:46,493
[SPEAKER_13]: The city council at their meeting will have the ability to add additional conditions if they were to so choose to.

745
01:21:46,513 --> 01:21:53,416
[SPEAKER_13]: If you give me a minute to scroll to the beginning of our, your public notices should have said exactly when that meeting is.

746
01:21:53,796 --> 01:21:54,177
[SPEAKER_13]: March 12th.

747
01:21:55,257 --> 01:22:07,447
[SPEAKER_13]: But the applicant perhaps would plan to have a response from their client for that meeting, if not before that time.

748
01:22:09,368 --> 01:22:18,936
[SPEAKER_13]: And if the resident would like to email us at OCD at Medford-MA.gov, we can put it in the chat.

749
01:22:18,976 --> 01:22:20,557
[SPEAKER_13]: Can one of the staff put that in the chat?

750
01:22:22,593 --> 01:22:24,194
[SPEAKER_13]: to have your contact information.

751
01:22:24,234 --> 01:22:29,199
[SPEAKER_13]: So if we do hear from the applicant before the city council meeting, we can let you know that.

752
01:22:32,381 --> 01:22:43,931
[SPEAKER_13]: And if the applicant wants to clarify for me what they meant by petition for it, that would be, we can discuss that and I can provide that information via email after the meeting.

753
01:22:45,812 --> 01:22:46,953
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you very much, Alicia.

754
01:22:46,973 --> 01:22:51,297
[SPEAKER_17]: And again, thank you, Attorney Borowsky and Mr. Quinn for following up.

755
01:22:53,224 --> 01:22:56,246
[SPEAKER_17]: I do see one other comment from Jack's iPad.

756
01:22:58,527 --> 01:23:05,791
[SPEAKER_17]: Alicia, can you please unmute and for the commenter, can you please identify yourself, state your name and your address?

757
01:23:09,293 --> 01:23:10,774
[SPEAKER_13]: So I clicked the app.

758
01:23:10,874 --> 01:23:11,495
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, there you got it.

759
01:23:11,715 --> 01:23:12,055
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

760
01:23:13,196 --> 01:23:16,458
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, it's John Carroll Lamont Warren, 35 Clayton Avenue.

761
01:23:18,568 --> 01:23:21,870
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if this is a time to bring up road and control.

762
01:23:21,970 --> 01:23:29,713
[SPEAKER_08]: I know with the excavation with the underground parking, I anticipate we just went through the green line extension.

763
01:23:30,614 --> 01:23:40,058
[SPEAKER_08]: And there was certainly a lot of issues around road and control and what are the plans for this development to mitigate some of that.

764
01:23:44,119 --> 01:23:48,421
[SPEAKER_08]: Is this not the place or the time and the process to bring this up or?

765
01:23:48,441 --> 01:23:55,925
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe I can answer that just conceptually through the chair.

766
01:23:56,826 --> 01:23:58,827
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, you can actually, yes, Mr. Quinn.

767
01:23:59,328 --> 01:24:12,395
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so when the demo permit is drawn and issued by the city, there will need to be in place a complete road and control program.

768
01:24:13,156 --> 01:24:21,601
[SPEAKER_07]: This includes traps, a contract to have these checked regularly, rebated,

769
01:24:23,335 --> 01:24:25,996
[SPEAKER_07]: B-A-I-T, and so forth.

770
01:24:26,317 --> 01:24:30,980
[SPEAKER_07]: So, of course, this is probably done for the Green Line.

771
01:24:31,040 --> 01:24:33,482
[SPEAKER_07]: This isn't, you know, nowhere near the scale of that.

772
01:24:34,503 --> 01:24:37,625
[SPEAKER_07]: But that is how that's controlled.

773
01:24:41,065 --> 01:24:42,005
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, thank you.

774
01:24:42,165 --> 01:24:44,206
[SPEAKER_13]: Chair, if you want sorry to interrupt.

775
01:24:45,286 --> 01:24:48,507
[SPEAKER_13]: There is a condition for that.

776
01:24:48,527 --> 01:24:51,568
[SPEAKER_13]: That was drafted by the health department.

777
01:24:51,588 --> 01:24:54,109
[SPEAKER_13]: And I will drop the exact language in the chat.

778
01:24:55,749 --> 01:24:57,510
[SPEAKER_13]: For that particular condition, if you'd like.

779
01:24:58,570 --> 01:24:59,650
[SPEAKER_13]: You want me to read it out now?

780
01:24:59,730 --> 01:25:05,332
[SPEAKER_13]: Are we going to whichever view I just felt since it was answering a specific question.

781
01:25:06,312 --> 01:25:08,233
[SPEAKER_13]: We could read that one particularly.

782
01:25:12,805 --> 01:25:13,826
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you want me to find it?

783
01:25:13,886 --> 01:25:14,727
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the last one.

784
01:25:14,787 --> 01:25:16,308
[SPEAKER_13]: It's number 41 on the list.

785
01:25:20,351 --> 01:25:29,659
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, I can read it now, but we're actually closing the public comments to go through all of the conditions and the department head comments, correct?

786
01:25:31,261 --> 01:25:35,524
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll highlight this one for the commenter.

787
01:25:35,724 --> 01:25:37,486
[SPEAKER_17]: Pre-demolition and pre-construction.

788
01:25:39,308 --> 01:25:45,409
[SPEAKER_17]: They in our requirement for permit sign off from the board of health, ongoing reports from a licensed pet control company will be required.

789
01:25:45,529 --> 01:25:50,590
[SPEAKER_17]: That will be a condition upon approval if approval is made to the city council.

790
01:25:51,970 --> 01:25:52,270
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

791
01:25:52,970 --> 01:25:54,171
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

792
01:25:54,751 --> 01:26:02,492
[SPEAKER_08]: If I could add one more comment, I'd like to throw my support behind Martha McFarland's comments concerning the roof deck.

793
01:26:07,273 --> 01:26:07,593
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

794
01:26:08,863 --> 01:26:09,303
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

795
01:26:09,323 --> 01:26:10,684
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

796
01:26:14,226 --> 01:26:15,868
[SPEAKER_13]: And I just checked her email again.

797
01:26:16,048 --> 01:26:18,970
[SPEAKER_13]: There were no new emails in the last 10 minutes.

798
01:26:33,619 --> 01:26:35,241
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there, I'm not sure.

799
01:26:35,261 --> 01:26:35,341
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

800
01:26:36,482 --> 01:26:37,342
[SPEAKER_17]: You can stop.

801
01:26:37,703 --> 01:26:43,287
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not sure if we're going to keep the sharing going for now or.

802
01:26:43,307 --> 01:26:48,971
[SPEAKER_07]: I can bring it back up whenever.

803
01:26:49,291 --> 01:26:50,272
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, if needed.

804
01:26:50,993 --> 01:26:55,236
[SPEAKER_17]: Actually, I couldn't see anyone else.

805
01:26:55,316 --> 01:26:58,659
[SPEAKER_17]: I just wanted to make sure before I close the comment period.

806
01:26:58,759 --> 01:26:59,199
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

807
01:26:59,579 --> 01:26:59,960
[SPEAKER_09]: Understood.

808
01:27:04,870 --> 01:27:05,310
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

809
01:27:05,330 --> 01:27:30,217
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, so I'm going to close the comment period now and I'm going to bring it back to the board to see if there's any clarifying, again, any clarifying comments that you are looking for or want to deliberate on now, especially to discuss the criteria for approval under site plan review and the PD special permit and potential conditions for approval actually.

810
01:27:32,587 --> 01:27:33,027
[SPEAKER_17]: Alicia.

811
01:27:35,309 --> 01:27:38,771
[SPEAKER_13]: You're on mute.

812
01:27:39,072 --> 01:27:47,778
[SPEAKER_13]: If the board doesn't have any more clarifying questions, I actually had two that I just thought we should ask if they weren't.

813
01:27:49,292 --> 01:27:50,333
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that all right?

814
01:27:50,534 --> 01:27:52,636
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't want to jump ahead of the board though.

815
01:27:53,137 --> 01:27:55,820
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I don't see any board hands.

816
01:27:56,081 --> 01:27:57,102
[SPEAKER_13]: Go right ahead, Alicia.

817
01:27:57,803 --> 01:28:05,512
[SPEAKER_13]: So I did want to, how the front lawn area of the small house is being treated now.

818
01:28:05,572 --> 01:28:08,155
[SPEAKER_13]: I heard it described today as a public park.

819
01:28:08,776 --> 01:28:21,623
[SPEAKER_13]: And I wanted to confirm that that was, in fact, that I heard that correctly, that it was designed for the public, but that they will be continuing the ownership of it and they will be privately maintaining it.

820
01:28:22,324 --> 01:28:24,765
[SPEAKER_13]: That wasn't an intention to turn it over to the public.

821
01:28:24,845 --> 01:28:26,646
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought we should have that clarified tonight.

822
01:28:29,491 --> 01:28:31,633
[SPEAKER_10]: I can answer that, yes, that is the case.

823
01:28:31,653 --> 01:28:45,504
[SPEAKER_10]: It will not be conveyed to the city or conveyed by way of easement, but the intent is to have it be a pocket park for use by the public and open to the public, and it will be privately maintained.

824
01:28:46,695 --> 01:28:47,635
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, thank you.

825
01:28:48,595 --> 01:28:51,796
[SPEAKER_13]: And then the other question was about the retail.

826
01:28:51,916 --> 01:28:57,138
[SPEAKER_13]: There have been over the past several years, several discussions of how that building would be used.

827
01:28:57,758 --> 01:29:06,840
[SPEAKER_13]: And I don't feel that that was really touched on really at all, other than we appreciate that you're maintaining the look of the historic house building.

828
01:29:07,320 --> 01:29:11,561
[SPEAKER_13]: But what is the current plan and thought for that property?

829
01:29:14,033 --> 01:29:17,776
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I think that the it's kind of a yet to be determined.

830
01:29:18,577 --> 01:29:35,472
[SPEAKER_10]: The thought was that it would be used as something a commercial use that would be the ancillary to the building residents as well as the community, potentially a daycare, potentially a gym, some sort of a convenience retail, certainly with with the project in the

831
01:29:35,612 --> 01:29:59,078
[SPEAKER_10]: state that it's in pre-approval with you know likely two years of construction there's not been a tenant secured at this point so really this this just remains the use will be you know by right pursuant to what's allowed under the PDD but the thought is to have it be something that you know that that will be of benefit to the residents and the

832
01:30:01,043 --> 01:30:01,463
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

833
01:30:01,623 --> 01:30:12,672
[SPEAKER_13]: Given that you just said the magic word daycare, I will actually tell you, I think that we've mentioned that there is a childcare, both daycare and afterschool, extreme shortage in our city.

834
01:30:13,352 --> 01:30:19,597
[SPEAKER_13]: And our office has been talking to private providers who are interested in coming into Medford, but need suitable spaces.

835
01:30:20,197 --> 01:30:27,042
[SPEAKER_13]: So if your client would like to connect with us, we would be happy to connect with them with

836
01:30:27,843 --> 01:30:33,966
[SPEAKER_13]: we've actually talked at this point to two different private daycare providers interested in looking for spaces in Medford.

837
01:30:36,047 --> 01:30:36,727
[SPEAKER_09]: Great, thank you.

838
01:30:41,349 --> 01:30:42,350
[SPEAKER_13]: That's all, Madam Chair.

839
01:30:42,990 --> 01:30:44,831
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for accommodating those.

840
01:30:46,292 --> 01:30:46,792
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

841
01:30:47,352 --> 01:30:50,414
[SPEAKER_17]: So before we can even go into this, we have to make sure that

842
01:30:55,714 --> 01:30:59,156
[SPEAKER_17]: The site plan is actually in court.

843
01:30:59,856 --> 01:31:06,520
[SPEAKER_17]: With the method zoning ordinance, the Community Development Board shall approve a site plan if the board finds that the site plan is consistent with the performance standards.

844
01:31:07,332 --> 01:31:16,497
[SPEAKER_17]: for multiple dwellings or non-residential use described in section 6.4, and that the proposed development meets the standards listed in section 11.710.

845
01:31:18,198 --> 01:31:19,719
[SPEAKER_17]: I will not read out all of those.

846
01:31:19,839 --> 01:31:21,539
[SPEAKER_17]: However, that's where we're pulling from.

847
01:31:21,620 --> 01:31:26,122
[SPEAKER_17]: So again, the standards for site plan review listed in section 11.7.10 of the zoning ordinance.

848
01:31:28,363 --> 01:31:41,836
[SPEAKER_17]: And we're also looking for the criteria for approval for a special permit granting authority may approve the PDU special permit if the SPGA finds that all the following, that there are, I believe there are nine.

849
01:31:43,978 --> 01:31:47,702
[SPEAKER_17]: And Alicia, usually Danielle will put these on the screen for the public to see.

850
01:31:47,862 --> 01:31:51,205
[SPEAKER_17]: There are nine criteria that need to be met for the permit.

851
01:31:52,451 --> 01:32:02,178
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm not sure if you want to share those for the public or if we can just go over the conditions that need to be discussed and hashed out per the department heads prior to us even getting to that.

852
01:32:03,659 --> 01:32:04,320
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, sorry.

853
01:32:04,460 --> 01:32:06,201
[SPEAKER_13]: I think I'm sharing the wrong thing.

854
01:32:07,102 --> 01:32:07,622
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me try.

855
01:32:13,164 --> 01:32:20,345
[SPEAKER_17]: So again, there's seven criteria under the site plan, and then there's about nine under the special permit granting agency.

856
01:32:20,425 --> 01:32:29,267
[SPEAKER_17]: And our due diligence would be to make sure that we, that the proponent in the project is covering all of them.

857
01:32:31,927 --> 01:32:40,569
[SPEAKER_17]: And based on city department head comments, if we were to approve this, there are conditions that would need to be met.

858
01:32:41,726 --> 01:32:44,767
[SPEAKER_17]: specifically speaking, 41 conditions in total.

859
01:32:46,969 --> 01:32:53,332
[SPEAKER_17]: And the city at this point will highlight those conditions for us.

860
01:32:53,572 --> 01:32:55,413
[SPEAKER_17]: Or Alicia, would you like me to highlight them?

861
01:32:59,034 --> 01:33:00,195
[SPEAKER_13]: I could do that.

862
01:33:00,295 --> 01:33:04,537
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you want me to... So these are the conditions you were referring to.

863
01:33:04,557 --> 01:33:06,218
[SPEAKER_13]: I assume everybody can see them now.

864
01:33:07,138 --> 01:33:10,160
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't make it small enough to put all on one screen at once.

865
01:33:11,550 --> 01:33:12,931
[SPEAKER_13]: if you want it legible.

866
01:33:13,891 --> 01:33:16,633
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you want me to switch over to the conditions file?

867
01:33:18,754 --> 01:33:20,875
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I think that it would make sense.

868
01:33:21,375 --> 01:33:25,998
[SPEAKER_13]: I haven't heard any additional conditions from the board unless they want to do that through deliberation.

869
01:33:26,018 --> 01:33:37,724
[SPEAKER_13]: Or if you'd like to start, has the applicant seen all of the department head letters and had a chance to review the requests and the conditions there?

870
01:33:38,665 --> 01:33:38,885
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

871
01:33:40,412 --> 01:33:41,813
[SPEAKER_13]: OK, those are the 41.

872
01:33:41,953 --> 01:33:44,976
[SPEAKER_13]: We actually put them into a document and numbered them.

873
01:33:46,036 --> 01:33:49,799
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to stop this share, and I'll put that up for a minute.

874
01:33:51,260 --> 01:33:53,442
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me make sure I have it right.

875
01:33:59,104 --> 01:34:02,848
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, and we did review them as a team.

876
01:34:03,469 --> 01:34:09,896
[SPEAKER_10]: And please, if anyone else on the team has anything contrary to say, please let me know.

877
01:34:10,356 --> 01:34:17,864
[SPEAKER_10]: But I believe I'm speaking for everyone to say that there were no objections to the conditions that were detailed in the various department recommendations.

878
01:34:19,047 --> 01:34:23,071
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe madam chair, if you like, we could touch on them just quickly section by section.

879
01:34:23,591 --> 01:34:24,072
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure.

880
01:34:24,612 --> 01:34:26,955
[SPEAKER_13]: The 1st, 3 were actually just about the.

881
01:34:28,076 --> 01:34:30,078
[SPEAKER_13]: Documenting what is the control plan?

882
01:34:30,098 --> 01:34:35,303
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, that it'll be dated and that you have to any changes to that you have to come.

883
01:34:36,403 --> 01:34:45,666
[SPEAKER_13]: to the Office of Planning to determine whether it's a modification that we can just administratively approve or if it needs to go back to the board.

884
01:34:46,267 --> 01:34:49,748
[SPEAKER_13]: And the third one is about recording the decision.

885
01:34:51,108 --> 01:34:56,050
[SPEAKER_13]: The traffic and transportation conditions, I think, tend to be of the most importance to the public.

886
01:34:57,351 --> 01:35:07,522
[SPEAKER_13]: That was around bicycle parking, EV parking, sight lines for drivers, stop me if there's any concerns on this.

887
01:35:08,483 --> 01:35:12,647
[SPEAKER_13]: A few of these require approval by the Medford traffic condition.

888
01:35:13,408 --> 01:35:41,003
[SPEAKER_13]: traffic commission to be clear uh a recommendation by this board would be that the applicant would take would apply to the traffic commission for these um if the traffic commission denies them then the applicant would not be held to them but um the applicant must make make due diligence to attempt to get them and i'm on that board so we'll know um uh just for the benefit of the public the um

889
01:35:42,845 --> 01:35:48,889
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a request from the traffic commissioner for a speed hump on Winchester Street.

890
01:35:48,909 --> 01:35:54,594
[SPEAKER_13]: I was thinking that that has to go to traffic commission.

891
01:35:54,634 --> 01:35:56,655
[SPEAKER_13]: That does not have to go to traffic commission.

892
01:35:58,417 --> 01:36:01,219
[SPEAKER_13]: That should be coordinated with the traffic director though.

893
01:36:02,740 --> 01:36:08,084
[SPEAKER_13]: Better sight lines, painting of crosswalks and stop signs, blinking stop signs.

894
01:36:11,152 --> 01:36:14,453
[SPEAKER_13]: bump-outs, painted bump-outs at corners and flex posts.

895
01:36:16,013 --> 01:36:22,135
[SPEAKER_13]: And then the MUTCD warrant analysis to determine if an all-way stop is warranted.

896
01:36:22,155 --> 01:36:25,436
[SPEAKER_13]: And then to provide the results of that to the city.

897
01:36:27,656 --> 01:36:32,898
[SPEAKER_13]: To provide sight lines and then a painted bike lane.

898
01:36:33,989 --> 01:36:41,074
[SPEAKER_13]: on Albion Street from Medford Street to Winchester Street, that a concept for that would have to go through the traffic commission.

899
01:36:42,855 --> 01:36:47,378
[SPEAKER_13]: Sounded like that you were comfortable with those.

900
01:36:47,538 --> 01:36:52,602
[SPEAKER_13]: Engineering, I don't know if we want to go through all of these.

901
01:36:56,670 --> 01:37:03,613
[SPEAKER_17]: If you can specifically touch on the water, because that was one of, I had a question, but there's a condition that captures.

902
01:37:06,234 --> 01:37:10,315
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's pretty much the... Do you think that was that number 20?

903
01:37:10,495 --> 01:37:11,956
[SPEAKER_13]: Several of these say water.

904
01:37:16,478 --> 01:37:19,879
[SPEAKER_13]: There was a stormwater report, cutting and capping.

905
01:37:20,039 --> 01:37:20,919
[SPEAKER_13]: Cutting and capping.

906
01:37:21,579 --> 01:37:27,821
[SPEAKER_13]: The applicant shall incorporate cutting and capping existing water services at the main within Winchester Street.

907
01:37:28,681 --> 01:37:31,581
[SPEAKER_13]: Tapping sleeves will be permitted for new water connections.

908
01:37:32,342 --> 01:37:34,982
[SPEAKER_17]: And then the city's coals drainage system.

909
01:37:35,142 --> 01:37:40,343
[SPEAKER_17]: Applicant shall update the plans to show the overflow pipes and connections, if any, to the city's coals drainage system.

910
01:37:40,363 --> 01:37:40,924
[SPEAKER_17]: That's number 17.

911
01:37:41,024 --> 01:37:41,164
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

912
01:37:45,773 --> 01:37:48,536
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you want to ask a particular question about any of these?

913
01:37:48,556 --> 01:37:53,261
[SPEAKER_17]: And that will be a condition to get the stormwater permit, correct?

914
01:37:57,765 --> 01:37:59,567
[SPEAKER_07]: Right in column.

915
01:37:59,987 --> 01:38:06,834
[SPEAKER_13]: So we do require stormwater permits, and this is in compliance with our updated stormwater regulations.

916
01:38:11,758 --> 01:38:12,979
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there, I'm not sure.

917
01:38:12,999 --> 01:38:15,159
[SPEAKER_13]: Nope, there's no other.

918
01:38:15,460 --> 01:38:16,820
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

919
01:38:18,501 --> 01:38:25,144
[SPEAKER_13]: City standards, so these engineering are all now our new standard engineering requirements.

920
01:38:26,244 --> 01:38:33,147
[SPEAKER_13]: The fire department conditions are all extremely standard about what is required in your building.

921
01:38:33,187 --> 01:38:35,248
[SPEAKER_13]: I assume there was nothing as a surprise here.

922
01:38:35,788 --> 01:38:38,289
[SPEAKER_13]: And then the health department, which of course included the

923
01:38:41,972 --> 01:38:56,343
[SPEAKER_13]: plans for the road and control and sewer disposal, dust remediation during construction, streets being clean every workday, demolition and building dumpster permits have to be obtained through the Board of Health.

924
01:38:57,344 --> 01:39:00,006
[SPEAKER_13]: The Board of Health also asked for a solid waste plan.

925
01:39:00,467 --> 01:39:06,412
[SPEAKER_13]: I do just want to advise the applicant that the city has recently updated our waste standards that all

926
01:39:08,518 --> 01:39:15,626
[SPEAKER_13]: Waste haulers that provide trash services in the city have to also provide recycling services at no additional cost.

927
01:39:16,667 --> 01:39:18,729
[SPEAKER_13]: Recycling is mandatory in Massachusetts.

928
01:39:18,749 --> 01:39:20,371
[SPEAKER_13]: We expect to see that in all our buildings.

929
01:39:21,572 --> 01:39:23,294
[SPEAKER_13]: I also just wanted to, as an FYI,

930
01:39:24,175 --> 01:39:31,758
[SPEAKER_13]: The city is in the process of implementing a composting program for all residents on the city's trash service.

931
01:39:31,778 --> 01:39:34,399
[SPEAKER_13]: So there'll be curbside commercial composting.

932
01:39:35,079 --> 01:39:46,364
[SPEAKER_13]: And we wanted to let developers building buildings know that because it is likely that residents in the buildings will start to ask for that, especially as we'll be implementing composting

933
01:39:46,924 --> 01:39:49,225
[SPEAKER_13]: in our schools and teaching the children about it.

934
01:39:50,306 --> 01:40:03,152
[SPEAKER_13]: We have started to discuss with some developers that if you're doing trash shoots to consider a third shoot in addition to trash and recycling for compost that we think this is what's going to be happening in the future.

935
01:40:03,592 --> 01:40:04,773
[SPEAKER_13]: Happy to discuss that.

936
01:40:04,933 --> 01:40:10,416
[SPEAKER_13]: Obviously that's not at a level that would be controlled by the site plan but felt I should toss it in there.

937
01:40:12,585 --> 01:40:17,892
[SPEAKER_13]: Those are all the conditions and I see Ari's raising their hand.

938
01:40:17,912 --> 01:40:20,335
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just checking with the staff.

939
01:40:20,375 --> 01:40:24,120
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think we heard any additional conditions yet that were not in here.

940
01:40:26,404 --> 01:40:26,524
[SPEAKER_05]: Ari?

941
01:40:29,455 --> 01:40:31,556
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

942
01:40:32,056 --> 01:40:42,420
[SPEAKER_05]: My question is, I think I had seen earlier, and I know I've seen in past projects, standard boilerplate about city noise standards.

943
01:40:42,820 --> 01:40:47,582
[SPEAKER_05]: And in light of the conversation I was hearing from public comment,

944
01:40:50,477 --> 01:40:53,218
[SPEAKER_05]: And those may be about construction specifically.

945
01:40:53,238 --> 01:40:57,460
[SPEAKER_05]: I see Alicia nodding that that was a helpful clarification.

946
01:40:57,480 --> 01:41:13,446
[SPEAKER_05]: I did want to bring up that that may be worth us discussing or specifically putting in, since it does seem like there are neighborhood concerns about noise and disruption, both during construction and long term.

947
01:41:16,937 --> 01:41:26,723
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm curious about what our tools and options are there to try to set everyone up for a mutually agreeable situation.

948
01:41:34,528 --> 01:41:41,333
[SPEAKER_17]: And that would be a question, Attorney Baranski, for the proponent of Mr. Quinn.

949
01:41:44,546 --> 01:41:55,338
[SPEAKER_10]: And Madam Chair, just so I understand the question, is the question what tools can the board utilize to limit construction noise?

950
01:41:55,438 --> 01:42:01,965
[SPEAKER_10]: Or is it more what mitigation efforts is the applicant able to provide?

951
01:42:02,365 --> 01:42:04,027
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to make sure I'm answering the question correctly.

952
01:42:05,748 --> 01:42:13,812
[SPEAKER_05]: I am curious about hearing what you'll do, but the question was specifically around the tools at the board's disposal.

953
01:42:14,213 --> 01:42:15,273
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for clarifying.

954
01:42:18,895 --> 01:42:22,657
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I think I think that that question would be more more for the board.

955
01:42:22,717 --> 01:42:25,058
[SPEAKER_10]: What I can tell you as far as the.

956
01:42:26,948 --> 01:42:31,269
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I think there are standards for noise during construction.

957
01:42:31,629 --> 01:42:55,253
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe to the extent that the city has a noise ordinance, that regardless of any limitations or lack of limitations that will put on use, hours, et cetera, that the applicant, once the building is constructed, would need to comply with any noise ordinances during operational hours regardless.

958
01:42:57,023 --> 01:43:04,145
[SPEAKER_10]: But as far as the, and I don't anticipate there being any significant noise during the operation.

959
01:43:04,165 --> 01:43:15,588
[SPEAKER_10]: And as I mentioned during public comment, we'd be happy to discuss and bring back to the city council to discuss any mitigation efforts we can make relative to the roof deck.

960
01:43:23,368 --> 01:43:24,489
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Tony Boranski.

961
01:43:25,009 --> 01:43:26,910
[SPEAKER_17]: Ari, did you have a further question?

962
01:43:32,452 --> 01:43:38,275
[SPEAKER_05]: I would be curious if Alicia has anything in mind, but otherwise, no.

963
01:43:45,453 --> 01:44:01,126
[SPEAKER_13]: In theory, the applicant, the owner could offer, you know, they would put things into their condo docs or their management documents or whatever about the use, the hours of the deck, stuff like that.

964
01:44:01,867 --> 01:44:04,189
[SPEAKER_13]: That is stuff that is legal.

965
01:44:04,209 --> 01:44:05,690
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me put it that way.

966
01:44:06,371 --> 01:44:07,351
[SPEAKER_13]: We don't actually

967
01:44:08,272 --> 01:44:15,101
[SPEAKER_13]: have very many roof decks in Medford, so I would be surprised if we had any precedence here in this city.

968
01:44:16,363 --> 01:44:17,805
[SPEAKER_13]: But there is, you know,

969
01:44:19,602 --> 01:44:25,504
[SPEAKER_13]: precedent for just saying like, oh, the city, they will put this or that into their management document.

970
01:44:25,544 --> 01:44:29,265
[SPEAKER_13]: I've seen it around snow and removal and stuff like that.

971
01:44:30,505 --> 01:44:33,346
[SPEAKER_13]: I was double-checking what our ordinances are.

972
01:44:33,406 --> 01:44:36,827
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, we do have a certain amount of nuisance.

973
01:44:37,087 --> 01:44:44,089
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a nuisance control ordinance around noise about

974
01:44:45,484 --> 01:44:49,573
[SPEAKER_13]: harm caused by loud and or unruly gatherings on private property.

975
01:44:49,593 --> 01:44:49,653
[SPEAKER_13]: And

976
01:44:53,338 --> 01:45:05,605
[SPEAKER_13]: Then it goes on to say, public nuisance, a gathering which constitutes a violation of law or creates a substantial disturbance of the quiet enjoyment of private or public property in a neighborhood.

977
01:45:06,285 --> 01:45:13,769
[SPEAKER_13]: Behavior constituting a public nuisance includes but is not limited to excessive noise and excessive pedestrian and vehicle traffic.

978
01:45:16,311 --> 01:45:17,771
[SPEAKER_13]: Unrelated, unrelated.

979
01:45:19,893 --> 01:45:21,674
[SPEAKER_13]: And then there's response.

980
01:45:23,492 --> 01:45:32,762
[SPEAKER_13]: Response costs, so the costs associated with responses by law enforcement by other emergency response to the gathering, which resulted in a public nuisance.

981
01:45:34,885 --> 01:45:43,875
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me, this kind of goes on for a while and I've not actually ever worked with this, so I'm pasting the link to that ordinance into the chat.

982
01:45:44,613 --> 01:45:47,235
[SPEAKER_13]: because it does kind of go on for quite a while.

983
01:45:47,796 --> 01:45:54,041
[SPEAKER_13]: And there are fines, $300, $400, $500 for subsequent responses.

984
01:45:56,923 --> 01:46:11,735
[SPEAKER_13]: And that this can be enforced by the police officers of the city, which in Medford means that it's enforceable 24 by seven, as opposed to things that have to be enforced by city staff during business hours.

985
01:46:15,328 --> 01:46:17,269
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that helpful?

986
01:46:17,289 --> 01:46:19,870
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm afraid we don't have very much precedence around this.

987
01:46:25,393 --> 01:46:26,814
[SPEAKER_07]: Madam Chairman, may I?

988
01:46:27,414 --> 01:46:27,955
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, please.

989
01:46:27,975 --> 01:46:33,798
[SPEAKER_07]: I also noticed that in the NODES ordinance, there are restrictions on when construction should take place.

990
01:46:34,999 --> 01:46:44,924
[SPEAKER_07]: But they're breaking the cake, if you will, with any building permit drawn from inspectional services in that regard.

991
01:46:47,640 --> 01:46:56,683
[SPEAKER_13]: Correct, sorry, I didn't the construction noise is covered very separately and I exactly in our zoning ordinance around construction noise 7am to 6pm.

992
01:46:56,763 --> 01:46:57,183
[SPEAKER_07]: If I may.

993
01:47:10,265 --> 01:47:15,190
[SPEAKER_05]: I do want to take the neighborhood concerns seriously.

994
01:47:15,210 --> 01:47:16,712
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't feel like we can.

995
01:47:17,693 --> 01:47:23,498
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure what we can do at this point prior to hearing the response of the applicant's clients.

996
01:47:25,500 --> 01:47:33,528
[SPEAKER_05]: But I would be curious, for example, continuing to explore putting

997
01:47:35,176 --> 01:47:43,702
[SPEAKER_05]: that language around what must be in the management documents to make sure that things will be quiet and respectful.

998
01:47:49,745 --> 01:47:54,949
[SPEAKER_17]: And looking over the conditions, what is the board's temperature on even grant and approval tonight?

999
01:47:55,009 --> 01:47:55,769
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not sure.

1000
01:47:55,789 --> 01:48:04,115
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not sure that we're able to get, are we going to continue this or is this something that you feel comfortable

1001
01:48:05,916 --> 01:48:14,258
[SPEAKER_17]: with approving or suggesting, recommending for approval to the city council with so many things that are left open?

1002
01:48:15,619 --> 01:48:21,340
[SPEAKER_13]: Madam Chair, most of these are not things that they could actually do for another meeting.

1003
01:48:22,480 --> 01:48:28,962
[SPEAKER_13]: They're actually items that have to be done, particularly the engineering ones during construction, most of them.

1004
01:48:35,670 --> 01:48:42,176
[SPEAKER_10]: If I may, Madam Chair, I just wanted to reiterate one thing relative to the roof deck, if I may.

1005
01:48:42,677 --> 01:48:43,337
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1006
01:48:43,698 --> 01:48:53,086
[SPEAKER_10]: It seems to me that unless I'm mistaken, this does seem to be the only open issue, which is one that I believe we can address before the city council.

1007
01:48:53,126 --> 01:48:56,530
[SPEAKER_10]: I would just reiterate to this board, if you look at the drawings,

1008
01:48:57,290 --> 01:48:58,051
[SPEAKER_10]: which I am now.

1009
01:48:58,551 --> 01:49:09,816
[SPEAKER_10]: Number one, the footprint of this roof deck in relationship to the entirety of the building is relatively small.

1010
01:49:09,876 --> 01:49:11,697
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not significantly larger.

1011
01:49:11,757 --> 01:49:18,701
[SPEAKER_10]: I think on a square footage basis, it is significantly smaller than the yard area on Alfred Street.

1012
01:49:18,741 --> 01:49:20,162
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think one idea,

1013
01:49:21,445 --> 01:49:34,776
[SPEAKER_10]: to note is that the roof deck is directly, it's contiguous and directly abutting a unit.

1014
01:49:34,836 --> 01:49:42,042
[SPEAKER_10]: If you zoom in right there, you can see there is a one-bedroom unit with its windows facing the roof deck.

1015
01:49:42,642 --> 01:49:58,387
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would anticipate that there will be condominium documents or management documents, rules and regulations, which would control the reasonable use of that roof deck for the exact purpose of the concerns that were raised during the public component here.

1016
01:49:59,187 --> 01:50:12,051
[SPEAKER_10]: Certainly, any concerns that an abutter on Albion Street has would be echoed by any of the individuals that would be purchasing or living in one of the units that's directly

1017
01:50:12,831 --> 01:50:15,453
[SPEAKER_10]: underneath or next to that roof deck.

1018
01:50:15,473 --> 01:50:19,196
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think that it will be some sort of self-regulation.

1019
01:50:19,216 --> 01:50:24,700
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that's easy for me to say here, but I do believe we can have a more concrete answer for you there.

1020
01:50:24,760 --> 01:50:35,488
[SPEAKER_10]: But this is not a situation where we're creating a roof deck that's going to be open all hours of the night or creating any sort of nuisance to people that live in the building themselves.

1021
01:50:35,528 --> 01:50:40,292
[SPEAKER_10]: People are not going to be interested in living here if there are not regulations on outdoor space.

1022
01:50:51,973 --> 01:50:55,795
[SPEAKER_17]: Peter, thank you for asking.

1023
01:50:57,856 --> 01:51:15,545
[SPEAKER_12]: To your point on being comfortable approving given the open conditions, partially echoing what Alicia said, I think most of these conditions are just, in a lot of ways, kind of matter of fact that will be addressed as the process continues.

1024
01:51:19,445 --> 01:51:32,009
[SPEAKER_12]: Attorney Bonaparte can correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe they said they are, the project team is comfortable with moving forward with accepting these conditions as applied.

1025
01:51:32,090 --> 01:51:46,735
[SPEAKER_12]: So I don't think, I personally am comfortable, would be comfortable moving to approve it because it seems that while these conditions are here, the project team has reviewed them and these conditions will be met.

1026
01:51:48,919 --> 01:51:50,359
[SPEAKER_12]: These are not surprises to anyone.

1027
01:52:00,663 --> 01:52:13,007
[SPEAKER_17]: So hearing the city's stance on where they stand with these conditions, as well as the board, at least one board member, and the proponent being amenable to

1028
01:52:14,795 --> 01:52:16,597
[SPEAKER_17]: adhering to these conditions.

1029
01:52:17,778 --> 01:52:25,186
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm looking for a motion to recommend approval with conditions of the plan development special permit and site plan review for 96 to 104 Winchester Street.

1030
01:52:30,232 --> 01:52:42,157
[SPEAKER_17]: However, before we go there, is the board open to add a condition just for the city to explore more on the noise ordinance issue or the noise nuisance issue?

1031
01:52:43,018 --> 01:52:48,240
[SPEAKER_17]: Is that something that we can even condition at this point without having determined what that would be?

1032
01:52:56,263 --> 01:52:57,564
[SPEAKER_17]: Don't everybody answer at once?

1033
01:52:58,772 --> 01:53:22,396
[SPEAKER_13]: So Madam Chair, because this is going to the city council for special permit, I'm actually thinking about this the way recently the board heard another, did another recommendation to the city council for special permit and the board attached all their conditions and then recommended that the city council add a condition.

1034
01:53:23,037 --> 01:53:24,637
[SPEAKER_13]: And so in theory,

1035
01:53:25,437 --> 01:53:43,025
[SPEAKER_13]: If this board wanted to, you could recommend to the city council that they explore and attach a condition of their special permit to mitigate noise concerns for the roof deck.

1036
01:53:45,846 --> 01:53:58,154
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not just that it's passing it down the road, but it's giving the applicant a little bit of time to come up with a proposal that they could come to the city council with saying, here's what we think would be reasonable.

1037
01:54:01,996 --> 01:54:03,437
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Vice Chair Hedeman.

1038
01:54:05,799 --> 01:54:06,739
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks, Chair McPherson.

1039
01:54:07,199 --> 01:54:09,401
[SPEAKER_16]: Through the chair, I think that sounds like a reasonable approach.

1040
01:54:10,277 --> 01:54:27,170
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, you know, I agree with fellow board members that I think that this is an important topic to discuss, um, and, you know, adequately address this community, these two community members concerns, which, you know, it sounds like there might be additional concerns beyond, uh, those in attendance at this meeting.

1041
01:54:28,231 --> 01:54:29,732
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, you know, it seems like the,

1042
01:54:32,675 --> 01:54:35,137
[SPEAKER_16]: The team for this project does want to be a good neighbor.

1043
01:54:35,317 --> 01:54:42,784
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm hoping that, you know, to continue those efforts in good faith, they'll address this prior to the city council meeting.

1044
01:54:42,824 --> 01:54:55,355
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'd be comfortable moving forward with the proposal that Director Hunt mentioned where, you know, we approve with conditions and then we recommend the city council revisit this topic.

1045
01:54:56,478 --> 01:55:04,659
[SPEAKER_16]: And I would encourage the members of the public to also attend those meetings with city council or send in their comments as well.

1046
01:55:11,701 --> 01:55:14,381
[SPEAKER_17]: And did we draft, I did not do any notation.

1047
01:55:14,401 --> 01:55:23,883
[SPEAKER_17]: Did we draft the actual approval language, the suggested approval language to city council for the noise nuisance?

1048
01:55:35,646 --> 01:55:41,929
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not sure anything down, but some of the, I was just checking with the staff.

1049
01:55:42,429 --> 01:55:47,311
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, I have two screens and way too many windows open right now.

1050
01:55:48,371 --> 01:55:53,053
[SPEAKER_13]: I will encourage the other staff to have something they could raise their hands and say so.

1051
01:56:07,913 --> 01:56:14,260
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, I think that we could recommend, give me one minute and I'll write this down first.

1052
01:56:15,982 --> 01:56:17,263
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Alicia.

1053
01:56:18,805 --> 01:56:20,306
[SPEAKER_17]: I was negligent in grabbing it.

1054
01:56:20,426 --> 01:56:25,091
[SPEAKER_17]: Usually I have an open document with the city and I will turn back and see that it's already there.

1055
01:56:31,566 --> 01:56:34,208
[SPEAKER_13]: We do have a document where we were going to take.

1056
01:56:34,228 --> 01:56:39,251
[SPEAKER_13]: So one was that the applicant shall comply with the city's noise ordinance.

1057
01:56:40,792 --> 01:56:46,435
[SPEAKER_13]: But honestly, I will say they have to do that whether you make that a condition or not.

1058
01:56:47,175 --> 01:56:57,942
[SPEAKER_13]: So I meant that the city council explore a condition with the applicant that

1059
01:57:00,993 --> 01:57:23,642
[SPEAKER_13]: manages that includes management, a requirement for management of the sound on their deck, management and mitigation of mitigation as like permanent parts of their management documents.

1060
01:57:23,662 --> 01:57:26,463
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure what the formal language for that would be.

1061
01:57:34,678 --> 01:57:37,136
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe the City Council Explorer can jump in.

1062
01:57:53,746 --> 01:58:10,379
[SPEAKER_13]: recommend the Community Development Board recommends that the City Council explore a condition with the applicant that includes a requirement for management and mitigation of sound on the roof deck as part of their permanent management documentation.

1063
01:58:15,744 --> 01:58:16,865
[SPEAKER_13]: To be clear that that is

1064
01:58:18,543 --> 01:58:30,890
[SPEAKER_13]: clear to everybody and that we would actually recommend to the applicant that you come up with a test, provide some ideas in advance.

1065
01:58:32,071 --> 01:58:35,613
[SPEAKER_13]: Our office, our staff would be happy to review ideas in advance as well.

1066
01:58:41,076 --> 01:58:41,256
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that?

1067
01:58:41,296 --> 01:58:43,217
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1068
01:58:50,343 --> 01:58:50,843
[SPEAKER_17]: Let me just.

1069
01:59:05,170 --> 01:59:14,275
[SPEAKER_13]: One question that I have for the board, I think that we should just have clarity is, is the board at this time

1070
01:59:15,748 --> 01:59:21,713
[SPEAKER_13]: asking or allowing the applicant to decide to remove the roof deck.

1071
01:59:23,314 --> 01:59:24,335
[SPEAKER_13]: There are certain levels.

1072
01:59:24,455 --> 01:59:32,742
[SPEAKER_13]: If this, interestingly to me, if this was a ground level patio, it would be very definitively part of the site plan.

1073
01:59:33,262 --> 01:59:40,288
[SPEAKER_13]: If it was approved by the CD board, the applicant could not actually remove it without coming back to the community development board.

1074
01:59:40,748 --> 01:59:42,470
[SPEAKER_13]: Because this is a roof deck,

1075
01:59:44,417 --> 01:59:49,439
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't tell you that I know off the top of my head without checking with somebody.

1076
01:59:49,459 --> 01:59:56,162
[SPEAKER_13]: If it is part of, I believe it is part of the controlling documents of the site plan.

1077
01:59:56,802 --> 02:00:05,286
[SPEAKER_13]: And therefore, if applicant were to choose to remove it, I'm not saying that I'm recommending that.

1078
02:00:06,606 --> 02:00:10,868
[SPEAKER_13]: Would that trigger their need to come back to the Community Development Board?

1079
02:00:12,092 --> 02:00:33,254
[SPEAKER_13]: And if the Community Development Board was open to it being an optional item, you could include a condition that says that the Community Development Board is neutral on having the roof deck and it may remain or be removed at the applicant's discretion.

1080
02:00:34,265 --> 02:00:43,055
[SPEAKER_13]: determination, or you may choose that it needs to be there and it's a controlling document and they need to come back if they want to change things.

1081
02:00:44,177 --> 02:00:45,919
[SPEAKER_13]: I just thought we should be clear about that.

1082
02:00:49,743 --> 02:00:52,286
[SPEAKER_17]: So what you're saying is that in exploring and management of

1083
02:00:54,060 --> 02:00:57,663
[SPEAKER_17]: the mitigation of sound and the city council was to come up with the condition.

1084
02:00:57,983 --> 02:01:02,387
[SPEAKER_17]: And therefore the applicant decided that they just wanted to totally remove the roof.

1085
02:01:02,888 --> 02:01:06,971
[SPEAKER_17]: That could actually trigger a trip back to us for site plan review.

1086
02:01:08,312 --> 02:01:11,615
[SPEAKER_17]: And you want to stop that ahead of time.

1087
02:01:15,234 --> 02:01:22,281
[SPEAKER_13]: I would actually ask the board, do you feel that that would be something that would need to bring them back to the Community Development Board for approval?

1088
02:01:22,561 --> 02:01:27,746
[SPEAKER_13]: Or would that be something that could be administratively approved?

1089
02:01:28,466 --> 02:01:30,908
[SPEAKER_13]: Would that be considered a change to the site plan?

1090
02:01:30,948 --> 02:01:37,054
[SPEAKER_13]: Because it is part of the open space calculations of the project, I believe.

1091
02:01:37,074 --> 02:01:39,256
[SPEAKER_17]: But it's not a major project.

1092
02:01:39,296 --> 02:01:41,258
[SPEAKER_17]: What determines it to be a major project?

1093
02:01:42,318 --> 02:01:44,900
[SPEAKER_17]: No, this is a major project because it's 29 units.

1094
02:01:44,960 --> 02:01:46,822
[SPEAKER_13]: The removal of the roof deck.

1095
02:01:47,302 --> 02:01:48,383
[SPEAKER_13]: A major change?

1096
02:01:48,643 --> 02:01:49,383
[SPEAKER_13]: A major change.

1097
02:01:49,403 --> 02:01:56,849
[SPEAKER_13]: If they had a ground level patio and they decided not to include it in the future, I would consider that to be a significant change.

1098
02:01:59,131 --> 02:02:00,432
[SPEAKER_13]: Vice President Hedeman?

1099
02:02:05,115 --> 02:02:06,056
[SPEAKER_16]: Vice President Hedeman?

1100
02:02:07,677 --> 02:02:08,778
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Chair McPherson.

1101
02:02:09,658 --> 02:02:11,520
[SPEAKER_16]: Through the chair, it sounds like

1102
02:02:13,557 --> 02:02:15,979
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, maybe we just better be safe than sorry.

1103
02:02:15,999 --> 02:02:33,810
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, if applicant does decide that, you know, potential conditions are too onerous and the best path forward may be to remove the deck, then I would hate to, you know, you know, cause any unintended consequences towards their timeline or towards the progress of this project.

1104
02:02:35,131 --> 02:02:41,715
[SPEAKER_16]: So if we can embed some flexibility, I think that that would be the best path forward for us as well as

1105
02:02:42,896 --> 02:02:44,717
[SPEAKER_16]: if the applicant is open to that approach.

1106
02:02:47,639 --> 02:02:47,979
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1107
02:02:51,281 --> 02:02:55,043
[SPEAKER_17]: Attorney Barofsky, what is your take on this?

1108
02:02:55,813 --> 02:03:04,138
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I think at this point, I think we're willing to work with any approach, of course, if we could streamline it.

1109
02:03:04,338 --> 02:03:15,224
[SPEAKER_10]: So a modification of the roof deck would not require a secondary visit to this board if you're kind of agnostic as to whether or not it's there.

1110
02:03:16,385 --> 02:03:19,627
[SPEAKER_10]: I did receive a message from our client, the developer, who is

1111
02:03:20,107 --> 02:03:24,328
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, more than willing to work with the concerns addressed by the neighbors.

1112
02:03:24,408 --> 02:03:30,550
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, the biggest issue here is to make sure that people feel comfortable with the proposal.

1113
02:03:30,630 --> 02:03:35,351
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're going to try to determine what will work best.

1114
02:03:35,471 --> 02:03:48,535
[SPEAKER_10]: And to Alicia's comments, we can certainly pass those modifications or mitigation efforts through the Community Development Board in anticipation for a hearing for City Council.

1115
02:03:52,235 --> 02:03:55,697
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you know that member Fishman has their hand up?

1116
02:03:55,977 --> 02:04:13,966
[SPEAKER_13]: I also realized that as you said that we could include a condition that says a modification or removal of the roof deck would not be considered a significant change to the site plan and could be approved administratively by the director of PDS.

1117
02:04:14,226 --> 02:04:17,308
[SPEAKER_13]: If the board chooses to, I'm not saying you need to.

1118
02:04:25,908 --> 02:04:27,529
[SPEAKER_17]: Try that language one more time, Alicia.

1119
02:04:27,549 --> 02:04:33,594
[SPEAKER_17]: A modification or removal of the roof deck will not require a return trip to the Community Development Board.

1120
02:04:34,254 --> 02:04:35,135
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what it means.

1121
02:04:35,535 --> 02:04:45,723
[SPEAKER_13]: A modification or removal of the roof deck would not be considered a significant change to the site plan and could be approved administratively by the director of PDS.

1122
02:04:53,148 --> 02:05:03,216
[SPEAKER_13]: That would allow them also to make changes to the roof deck that might in other situations be considered significant.

1123
02:05:03,256 --> 02:05:09,801
[SPEAKER_13]: But in this case, you would feel as being compliant with your request.

1124
02:05:15,986 --> 02:05:18,888
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Fishman's hand blends in with their background.

1125
02:05:19,609 --> 02:05:19,709
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh.

1126
02:05:23,385 --> 02:05:23,966
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead Ari.

1127
02:05:25,768 --> 02:05:30,593
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you chair and thank you Alicia for flagging that I had not noticed.

1128
02:05:31,835 --> 02:05:40,965
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that this, I agree with vice chair Hedeman and Alicia that putting in that flexibility serves all of our interests.

1129
02:05:42,275 --> 02:05:59,085
[SPEAKER_05]: And while in general modification is a very broad term, I do trust that the checks of Director Hunt and the City Council will be more than sufficient to ensure that this goes in reasonable direction.

1130
02:05:59,185 --> 02:06:02,947
[SPEAKER_05]: So I feel comfortable with that as a path forward.

1131
02:06:10,418 --> 02:06:13,870
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, I'm just wordsmithing some language here.

1132
02:06:43,359 --> 02:06:47,401
[SPEAKER_17]: So for the record, Alicia, I've sent you the language.

1133
02:06:54,705 --> 02:06:55,826
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, I didn't catch that.

1134
02:06:56,046 --> 02:06:57,647
[SPEAKER_13]: You think something language?

1135
02:06:58,027 --> 02:06:59,327
[SPEAKER_13]: I've sent you language.

1136
02:06:59,848 --> 02:07:01,689
[SPEAKER_13]: Sent language, sorry, in the chat?

1137
02:07:02,289 --> 02:07:02,569
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1138
02:07:05,971 --> 02:07:09,733
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't see anything in the chat or via email.

1139
02:07:14,382 --> 02:07:15,663
[SPEAKER_14]: close my chat and reopen it.

1140
02:07:30,874 --> 02:07:36,318
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, Jackie, you may have sent it to somebody else by accident.

1141
02:07:37,980 --> 02:07:40,822
[SPEAKER_13]: Because we have it turned on that you can only send it

1142
02:07:44,102 --> 02:07:44,542
[SPEAKER_13]: There we go.

1143
02:07:45,182 --> 02:07:56,107
[SPEAKER_13]: A modification or removal of the roof deck will not be considered a significant site change requiring a return trip to the Community Development Board for approval.

1144
02:07:56,127 --> 02:08:12,933
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm gonna send that to everybody so that the other members, personally, it's helpful for me to see the writing.

1145
02:08:19,799 --> 02:08:21,161
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Hedeman has her hand up.

1146
02:08:24,785 --> 02:08:25,526
[SPEAKER_13]: Vice Chair Hedeman?

1147
02:08:27,208 --> 02:08:28,149
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks, Chair McPherson.

1148
02:08:30,652 --> 02:08:34,776
[SPEAKER_16]: I think in the context of this conversation, that condition makes sense.

1149
02:08:34,876 --> 02:08:39,081
[SPEAKER_16]: However, I feel like we should potentially put some upper bounds on modification.

1150
02:08:41,172 --> 02:08:59,960
[SPEAKER_16]: I by no means assume that the applicant would take this approach, but a modification could be understood to be, you know, an increase of the size or, you know, maybe removing those six-foot screens that they've already suggested.

1151
02:09:00,441 --> 02:09:04,402
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, I'm not suggesting the applicant would do it, but I think just to provide

1152
02:09:06,172 --> 02:09:11,076
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, extreme clarity in terms of what our intents are would be helpful.

1153
02:09:15,139 --> 02:09:19,522
[SPEAKER_16]: Open to other suggestions from the board if people don't think that's necessary.

1154
02:09:37,455 --> 02:09:41,018
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm just at this point, not sure how much we can condition.

1155
02:09:43,779 --> 02:09:54,207
[SPEAKER_17]: Sort of like a condition that we're not even, I just want to make sure that we make it as easy and transparent for the proponent going forward.

1156
02:09:54,727 --> 02:09:58,690
[SPEAKER_17]: We don't want to add any undue hardship on them.

1157
02:10:05,025 --> 02:10:07,730
[SPEAKER_17]: But at the same time, I want to make sure that we capture it clear here.

1158
02:10:09,454 --> 02:10:13,823
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's why I'm looking for direction from the city on how to move forward with that.

1159
02:10:19,521 --> 02:10:35,047
[SPEAKER_10]: Madam Chair, if I may, I don't think that there would be any objection if the language said something to the extent of any modification which does not expand the outdoor patio or something to that extent.

1160
02:10:35,067 --> 02:10:36,488
[SPEAKER_10]: There certainly would be no objection.

1161
02:10:36,528 --> 02:10:46,132
[SPEAKER_10]: There would be no intent to utilize that language to create an expansion or take away any of the mitigation efforts there.

1162
02:10:48,822 --> 02:10:56,165
[SPEAKER_13]: So if we said, and I think the question is, there are two options if we're pursuing this line.

1163
02:10:56,285 --> 02:10:59,386
[SPEAKER_13]: One is to just say it doesn't have to come back to the Community Development Board.

1164
02:10:59,826 --> 02:11:07,989
[SPEAKER_13]: The other is to say it could be approved administratively by the office, which means they have to tell us, they have to run it by us, they can't just do it.

1165
02:11:09,570 --> 02:11:12,511
[SPEAKER_13]: But we can approve it, it doesn't have to go to the board.

1166
02:11:12,531 --> 02:11:12,571
[SPEAKER_13]: So,

1167
02:11:16,342 --> 02:11:31,308
[SPEAKER_13]: The language we have, this would be any modification or removal that does not expand the roof deck would not be considered a significant change to the site plan and could be approved by the director of PDS.

1168
02:11:34,889 --> 02:11:44,253
[SPEAKER_13]: Or if you, so the other language was, um, would not be considered a significant change and would not require a return trip to the community development board.

1169
02:12:03,778 --> 02:12:10,482
[SPEAKER_16]: I support the former language where we specify that it's not an expansion and it may not require.

1170
02:12:10,523 --> 02:12:10,723
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry.

1171
02:12:37,672 --> 02:12:48,378
[SPEAKER_12]: I also support the formal language for the inclusion of the administrator approval, because I want to make sure that there will be some oversight.

1172
02:12:48,399 --> 02:13:01,627
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, so I have a couple of, I have language to read, and I want to make sure that I grab that.

1173
02:13:01,647 --> 02:13:03,328
[SPEAKER_17]: Alicia, have you written that out?

1174
02:13:04,038 --> 02:13:05,179
[SPEAKER_17]: Can you share that with me?

1175
02:13:05,799 --> 02:13:07,880
[SPEAKER_17]: We've been along.

1176
02:13:09,502 --> 02:13:14,685
[SPEAKER_14]: I apologize.

1177
02:13:21,609 --> 02:13:23,651
[SPEAKER_14]: I think this is the one you were asking for.

1178
02:13:23,671 --> 02:13:23,711
[SPEAKER_14]: OK.

1179
02:13:23,731 --> 02:13:24,651
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1180
02:13:34,846 --> 02:13:42,293
[SPEAKER_17]: Vice Chair Hederman has, just before I read them out, she'll be right back.

1181
02:13:50,780 --> 02:13:55,945
[SPEAKER_17]: As soon as we get her back, I will read them out and then we can go.

1182
02:13:56,625 --> 02:13:56,905
[SPEAKER_17]: Back.

1183
02:13:57,766 --> 02:13:58,467
[SPEAKER_17]: Awesome.

1184
02:14:02,317 --> 02:14:08,678
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, so this is in reference to 96 to 100 Winchester Street.

1185
02:14:09,799 --> 02:14:16,360
[SPEAKER_17]: I am looking for a motion to recommend approval with conditions of the plan development special permit and site plan review.

1186
02:14:17,900 --> 02:14:29,063
[SPEAKER_17]: We are also recommending that the city council explore condition with applicant that includes a requirement for management and mitigation of sound on the roof deck as part of their permanent management document.

1187
02:14:30,478 --> 02:14:41,481
[SPEAKER_17]: Any modification or removal which does not expand the roof deck will not be considered a significant site change and may be approved administratively by the Director of Office of Planning, Development, and Sustainability.

1188
02:14:43,801 --> 02:14:44,541
[SPEAKER_17]: That's the motion.

1189
02:14:44,561 --> 02:14:47,422
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that moved?

1190
02:14:49,122 --> 02:14:49,523
[SPEAKER_17]: Second.

1191
02:14:51,683 --> 02:14:52,283
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll second it.

1192
02:14:55,124 --> 02:14:56,604
[SPEAKER_17]: Vice Chair Emily Henneman?

1193
02:14:57,525 --> 02:14:57,665
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

1194
02:14:58,365 --> 02:14:58,965
[SPEAKER_17]: Peter Cowles?

1195
02:15:00,157 --> 02:15:00,277
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

1196
02:15:00,918 --> 02:15:01,578
[SPEAKER_17]: Ari Fishman.

1197
02:15:03,079 --> 02:15:03,179
[SPEAKER_17]: Aye.

1198
02:15:03,199 --> 02:15:04,900
[SPEAKER_17]: Pam Mariansky.

1199
02:15:05,601 --> 02:15:05,701
[SPEAKER_17]: Aye.

1200
02:15:06,701 --> 02:15:07,962
[SPEAKER_17]: Myself, Jackie McPherson.

1201
02:15:08,022 --> 02:15:08,483
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm an aye.

1202
02:15:10,024 --> 02:15:15,587
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you so much, Attorney Baransky, Mr. Quinn, and the rest of your team.

1203
02:15:16,368 --> 02:15:17,108
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

1204
02:15:17,608 --> 02:15:18,589
[SPEAKER_07]: Much appreciated your time.

1205
02:15:18,989 --> 02:15:19,510
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1206
02:15:20,050 --> 02:15:20,891
[SPEAKER_17]: Have a great evening.

1207
02:15:21,391 --> 02:15:21,691
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks.

1208
02:15:22,412 --> 02:15:22,992
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye-bye.

1209
02:15:28,202 --> 02:15:38,287
[SPEAKER_13]: Madam Chair, as you switch between to the next item on the agenda, I don't know about the rest of the staff, I need a two minute break.

1210
02:15:47,451 --> 02:15:50,032
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that okay with the board if we just take two minutes?

1211
02:15:51,473 --> 02:15:51,913
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure.

1212
02:15:52,033 --> 02:15:52,694
[SPEAKER_13]: Extremely.

1213
02:15:52,714 --> 02:15:54,795
[SPEAKER_17]: The board's saying yes.

1214
02:15:55,395 --> 02:15:55,695
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1215
02:15:57,845 --> 02:15:58,715
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1216
02:21:35,905 --> 02:21:38,146
[SPEAKER_09]: Madam chair, the staff are back when you are ready.

1217
02:21:38,166 --> 02:21:46,112
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not sure if all the members are back.

1218
02:21:55,958 --> 02:21:56,939
[SPEAKER_17]: Hi, thank you.

1219
02:21:56,959 --> 02:21:58,900
[SPEAKER_17]: I had actually.

1220
02:22:01,977 --> 02:22:02,899
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, I was on mute.

1221
02:22:02,959 --> 02:22:07,087
[SPEAKER_17]: I had started reading the agenda item and didn't realize I was on mute.

1222
02:22:08,430 --> 02:22:12,898
[SPEAKER_17]: So the next item on our agenda is 290 Salem Street, a special permit and

1223
02:22:15,730 --> 02:22:19,112
[SPEAKER_17]: This is for a special permit for neighborhood retail use and site plan review.

1224
02:22:19,492 --> 02:22:25,876
[SPEAKER_17]: The Medford Community Development Board shall conduct a public hearing on February 21st, 2024 after 6.30 p.m.

1225
02:22:26,016 --> 02:22:42,206
[SPEAKER_17]: via Zoom relative to an application by 290 Salem Street, LLC for a special permit for neighborhood retail use and site plan review to permit the construction of a three-story mixed-use building that would contain seven residential units and two ground floor commercial units.

1226
02:22:42,787 --> 02:22:50,360
[SPEAKER_17]: at the site known as 290 Salem Street, comprised of properties located at 290 Salem Street and 209 Park Street, Medford, Mass.

1227
02:22:52,844 --> 02:22:56,109
[SPEAKER_17]: So I believe the staff has some introductory comments on this.

1228
02:22:57,144 --> 02:22:58,205
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, Madam Chair.

1229
02:22:59,065 --> 02:23:06,150
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is one of the projects where the process is a little complicated.

1230
02:23:06,450 --> 02:23:09,833
[SPEAKER_13]: This project requires site plan review because it's a major project.

1231
02:23:09,893 --> 02:23:11,994
[SPEAKER_13]: It's more than six residential units.

1232
02:23:12,555 --> 02:23:17,018
[SPEAKER_13]: It needs a special permit to establish the retail use in this zone.

1233
02:23:17,078 --> 02:23:18,699
[SPEAKER_13]: Retail use is not actually allowed.

1234
02:23:21,840 --> 02:23:26,924
[SPEAKER_13]: In addition, however, there are multiple zoning variances that are necessary from the zoning board.

1235
02:23:27,464 --> 02:23:33,588
[SPEAKER_13]: The zoning variances need to be granted before the CD board can approve the site plan.

1236
02:23:34,729 --> 02:23:38,931
[SPEAKER_13]: Tonight, we need to legally open the public hearing.

1237
02:23:40,012 --> 02:23:47,617
[SPEAKER_13]: We will, the plan is to then, we need to actually continue it until after the zoning variances are granted.

1238
02:23:49,278 --> 02:23:51,479
[SPEAKER_13]: to understand whether or not the relief is granted.

1239
02:23:52,759 --> 02:23:57,542
[SPEAKER_13]: Depending what the zoning board does, it could impact that the project could change.

1240
02:23:59,523 --> 02:24:14,310
[SPEAKER_13]: However, we strongly recommend that in the interest of respecting everyone's time, we allow the proponent to present tonight and allow the board to ask some questions, because if the board wants additional materials or clarifying materials that the applicant can provide,

1241
02:24:14,730 --> 02:24:23,633
[SPEAKER_13]: When they return after hearing the zoning board, this will allow them to prepare that additional material and bring it back.

1242
02:24:24,153 --> 02:24:28,775
[SPEAKER_13]: Additionally, there was no way to notify the public of this back and forth.

1243
02:24:29,175 --> 02:24:38,398
[SPEAKER_13]: So there may be members of the public here tonight who would want to provide comments on the project or learn more about the project.

1244
02:24:39,638 --> 02:24:42,339
[SPEAKER_13]: We would then recommend allowing public comment

1245
02:24:43,188 --> 02:24:51,459
[SPEAKER_13]: after the zoning is approved in the event that there are any changes or to reflect any additional material that the board may ask for.

1246
02:24:51,479 --> 02:24:58,528
[SPEAKER_13]: So Madam Chair, back to you.

1247
02:25:00,433 --> 02:25:00,873
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1248
02:25:01,013 --> 02:25:11,162
[SPEAKER_17]: So just to be clear, we are listening, we are opening up the hearing this evening, but we would not be considering a criteria for approval this evening.

1249
02:25:12,122 --> 02:25:15,365
[SPEAKER_17]: We will be providing feedback to the proponent.

1250
02:25:15,765 --> 02:25:20,269
[SPEAKER_17]: And with that, I'm gonna ask the applicant to introduce themselves and to present a proposal.

1251
02:25:23,071 --> 02:25:23,451
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry.

1252
02:25:23,932 --> 02:25:26,334
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, I'm Terry Vonosky.

1253
02:25:30,978 --> 02:25:33,200
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1254
02:25:33,240 --> 02:25:34,340
[SPEAKER_10]: I see you all again.

1255
02:25:34,380 --> 02:25:40,444
[SPEAKER_10]: For the record, Adam Barnosky, 255 State Street in Boston, attorney for 290 Salem Street.

1256
02:25:41,105 --> 02:25:45,328
[SPEAKER_10]: In the interest of time, this late hour, I will try to keep the introductory remarks brief.

1257
02:25:45,888 --> 02:25:51,452
[SPEAKER_10]: With me tonight is Fernando Bento, the principal and owner of the property, the project architect, Jacob Levine.

1258
02:25:52,252 --> 02:25:56,816
[SPEAKER_10]: project engineer Patrick Bauer and landscape architect Katia Pazzallo.

1259
02:25:57,417 --> 02:26:00,960
[SPEAKER_10]: Here regarding the site plan review and special permit for 290 Salem Street.

1260
02:26:00,980 --> 02:26:06,966
[SPEAKER_10]: Specifically, the special permit is to permit neighborhood retail use in the apartment 1 zoning district.

1261
02:26:06,986 --> 02:26:14,632
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to provide a background and overview of the projects, and then the design team will give some more detail.

1262
02:26:15,957 --> 02:26:22,421
[SPEAKER_10]: 290 Salem Street is the record owner of the property, which is located on the northeast corner of Salem Street and Park Street.

1263
02:26:23,001 --> 02:26:29,085
[SPEAKER_10]: It is comprised of two parcels measuring approximately 8,842 square feet.

1264
02:26:29,825 --> 02:26:42,013
[SPEAKER_10]: The property is a polygonal lot with 96.6 feet of frontage along Salem Street and 145 feet of frontage along Park Street, the entirety of which is located in the apartment one zoning district.

1265
02:26:42,553 --> 02:26:45,015
[SPEAKER_10]: This was formerly a commercial space.

1266
02:26:45,556 --> 02:26:49,359
[SPEAKER_10]: The prior structure has been demolished and the property is now vacant.

1267
02:26:49,879 --> 02:27:10,317
[SPEAKER_10]: The applicant seeks to construct a new three-story mixed-use building consisting of two commercial units, seven residential units comprised of six two-bedroom units and one one-bedroom unit, eight parking spaces at grade, a roof deck, and other amenities including a mailroom and covered bike storage with charging capabilities.

1268
02:27:11,097 --> 02:27:21,324
[SPEAKER_10]: The two commercial units will be located on the ground floor with entrances off of Salem Street and are intended to be used for neighborhood retail and or a coffee shop.

1269
02:27:21,424 --> 02:27:25,206
[SPEAKER_10]: It's that first component, the neighborhood retailer requires a special permit from this board.

1270
02:27:25,887 --> 02:27:31,070
[SPEAKER_10]: The second floor will have three two-bedroom units and one one-bedroom unit.

1271
02:27:31,150 --> 02:27:33,892
[SPEAKER_10]: The third floor will have three two-bedroom units.

1272
02:27:34,632 --> 02:27:46,166
[SPEAKER_10]: The development will consist of a single building having gross square footage of 12,522 square feet and net square footage of 10,018 square feet, excluding the roof deck.

1273
02:27:46,687 --> 02:27:49,511
[SPEAKER_10]: The proposed building has a total lot coverage of 5,093 square feet or 57%.

1274
02:27:53,784 --> 02:27:58,210
[SPEAKER_10]: Based on publicly available records, there are no existing easements or encumbrances affecting the lot.

1275
02:27:58,630 --> 02:28:03,376
[SPEAKER_10]: The applicant does not propose any new easements or encumbrances as part of this proposal.

1276
02:28:04,037 --> 02:28:12,967
[SPEAKER_10]: The estimated time for completion of this following receipt of all permits is 24 months, subject to labor and supply chain availability.

1277
02:28:13,828 --> 02:28:21,139
[SPEAKER_10]: a dignity to relief, we do need it under use table AF3 and pursuant to section 94.32.

1278
02:28:21,500 --> 02:28:28,009
[SPEAKER_10]: A special permit is required from this board as the special permit granting authority relative to that use.

1279
02:28:30,510 --> 02:28:33,431
[SPEAKER_10]: We do have a hearing, as was mentioned at the outset of the meeting.

1280
02:28:33,451 --> 02:28:39,072
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a hearing before the zoning board, which is currently scheduled for next Thursday, February 29th.

1281
02:28:39,292 --> 02:28:51,395
[SPEAKER_10]: This is regarding the zoning relief required for the project, which includes dimensional relief for lot area, front and side yard setbacks, lot coverage, and the proposed eating establishment use.

1282
02:28:52,175 --> 02:28:55,758
[SPEAKER_10]: And so with that, that's a very succinct overview.

1283
02:28:55,938 --> 02:29:03,225
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd like to turn it over to Jacob to discuss design, then Katya to discuss landscaping, and Patrick to address engineering.

1284
02:29:04,065 --> 02:29:04,386
[SPEAKER_10]: Jacob?

1285
02:29:05,146 --> 02:29:07,689
[SPEAKER_13]: Can you let us, sorry, which, thank you.

1286
02:29:08,789 --> 02:29:10,991
[SPEAKER_13]: And does anybody need to share screen for this?

1287
02:29:11,011 --> 02:29:12,132
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1288
02:29:13,273 --> 02:29:15,916
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, I should have asked that while I was speaking.

1289
02:29:16,496 --> 02:29:17,117
[SPEAKER_13]: You're all set now.

1290
02:29:17,757 --> 02:29:18,898
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

1291
02:29:19,198 --> 02:29:27,064
[SPEAKER_13]: I did want to just mention there was an account, a Verdant Architecture account that had repeated problems coming in and isn't currently connected.

1292
02:29:27,104 --> 02:29:28,645
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not sure if that's important for you.

1293
02:29:30,566 --> 02:29:33,148
[SPEAKER_10]: That is Katya, the landscape architect.

1294
02:29:33,369 --> 02:29:35,150
[SPEAKER_10]: I do believe she intends to present.

1295
02:29:35,230 --> 02:29:37,952
[SPEAKER_10]: So I guess we'll see if she's able to make it.

1296
02:29:37,992 --> 02:29:40,314
[SPEAKER_10]: She was on the last hearing of that issue.

1297
02:29:41,555 --> 02:29:43,396
[SPEAKER_17]: Katya has entered.

1298
02:29:44,557 --> 02:29:44,937
[SPEAKER_17]: Katya?

1299
02:29:46,758 --> 02:29:47,499
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, she's here.

1300
02:29:51,310 --> 02:29:51,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, everybody.

1301
02:29:51,910 --> 02:29:52,871
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I was having trouble.

1302
02:29:52,891 --> 02:29:56,854
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what happened, but I'm on now via my computer.

1303
02:29:56,894 --> 02:29:57,234
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1304
02:30:03,239 --> 02:30:03,599
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

1305
02:30:04,019 --> 02:30:05,100
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you, Madam Chair.

1306
02:30:05,260 --> 02:30:07,762
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the architect, Jacob Levine, representing S.L.

1307
02:30:07,782 --> 02:30:10,945
[SPEAKER_00]: Haas Group from 27 Congress Street in Salem, Mass.

1308
02:30:12,426 --> 02:30:16,309
[SPEAKER_00]: As Adam did a great job kind of giving a little background on this project.

1309
02:30:17,049 --> 02:30:20,732
[SPEAKER_00]: As all of you know, this is a really prominent corner in Medford.

1310
02:30:21,661 --> 02:30:26,222
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're really excited about this project and kind of what it's going to bring to the neighborhood compared to what was there.

1311
02:30:26,762 --> 02:30:41,725
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have seven units, six, two bedrooms and one, one bedroom, including that roof deck, which it's a little different in this case than what we saw in the last project, but we're going to kind of get into the floor plans a little bit, not too much detail tonight.

1312
02:30:42,245 --> 02:30:46,445
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially, we're going to provide eight spaces with two EV ready with covered bike parking.

1313
02:30:46,885 --> 02:30:49,586
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially the mass of the building is going to sit over these

1314
02:30:50,379 --> 02:31:08,252
[SPEAKER_00]: eight spaces, so to provide covered parking, to which a mail room, two commercial spaces right off Salem Street, so majority of the traffic would be coming in and out of Park Street and not directly off Salem Street, room for dumpsters, and then the egress up into the units.

1315
02:31:08,712 --> 02:31:14,336
[SPEAKER_00]: We have one unit that's the single bed on floor two, and then floor three has all the two beds.

1316
02:31:16,098 --> 02:31:16,238
[SPEAKER_00]: The

1317
02:31:16,675 --> 02:31:24,159
[SPEAKER_00]: Biggest challenge with this project would be the site and just its odd shape, which kind of dictates the building to have this jagged corner.

1318
02:31:24,640 --> 02:31:30,123
[SPEAKER_00]: And we kind of studied what happened with this corner, which we'll get to a little bit more on some of the 3D images.

1319
02:31:31,504 --> 02:31:35,026
[SPEAKER_00]: We are proposing a roof deck with solar panels in the back.

1320
02:31:35,286 --> 02:31:41,850
[SPEAKER_00]: We feel it's important at this part of the city to have some outdoor space and outdoor amenities for the tenants.

1321
02:31:42,070 --> 02:31:45,492
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this is only seven units and it's on a busy street like Salem.

1322
02:31:45,956 --> 02:31:48,178
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is a little bit different than the last project.

1323
02:31:48,658 --> 02:31:55,364
[SPEAKER_00]: And we feel like it's a good opportunity to provide outdoor space and not necessarily balconies or Juliet balconies.

1324
02:31:55,404 --> 02:32:00,007
[SPEAKER_00]: So this would be a shared amenity between the seven units with EV panels in the back.

1325
02:32:03,090 --> 02:32:05,832
[SPEAKER_00]: Next, just kind of starting to look at the massing and the elevation.

1326
02:32:05,912 --> 02:32:09,035
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could see the parking is below the two stories.

1327
02:32:09,896 --> 02:32:15,300
[SPEAKER_00]: We want one story of brick or terracotta and then a hearty plank of some sort

1328
02:32:15,743 --> 02:32:17,485
[SPEAKER_00]: or fiber cement on the top floors.

1329
02:32:18,066 --> 02:32:20,349
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see it a little bit better on the 3D image.

1330
02:32:20,850 --> 02:32:33,827
[SPEAKER_00]: So the building across the street is a really historic, important building that the design team has been studying and using as a great example of what we want to fit into the context of this triangle lot, if you will.

1331
02:32:34,710 --> 02:32:52,563
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been a few modern multifamily buildings built on this lot with metal panel that somewhat stick out and we really feel like trying to play with these bay windows and the architecture of the ornateness of the building across the street is something we want to capture in our new design.

1332
02:32:53,344 --> 02:32:57,027
[SPEAKER_00]: We want the roof deck to kind of have a natural parapet so you really wouldn't see

1333
02:32:57,704 --> 02:32:59,145
[SPEAKER_00]: anything that's happening up there.

1334
02:32:59,165 --> 02:33:03,729
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be almost feel like a real private area and just trying to use it for light.

1335
02:33:04,290 --> 02:33:14,038
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this corner, we're still trying to figure out the best use for it, rather if it's enclosed or open, but essentially that's a great little spot for a deck and look out and see what's happening on the street side.

1336
02:33:14,698 --> 02:33:23,182
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you could see the brick to match across the street, almost a reverse instinct with the red brick down here, and then the commercial spaces off Salem Street.

1337
02:33:23,602 --> 02:33:27,764
[SPEAKER_00]: We're providing two commercial space in this design.

1338
02:33:28,364 --> 02:33:35,087
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people would enter the main building right here, as said, and not necessarily off Salem.

1339
02:33:35,807 --> 02:33:40,029
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what we have tonight to show for our beautiful seven-unit building.

1340
02:33:40,609 --> 02:33:43,350
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll turn it back to Adam, and thank you very much.

1341
02:33:46,764 --> 02:33:48,124
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1342
02:33:48,184 --> 02:33:51,946
[SPEAKER_10]: Katya, do you want to talk a little bit about the landscape plan?

1343
02:33:52,986 --> 02:33:53,586
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be great.

1344
02:33:53,866 --> 02:34:00,848
[SPEAKER_03]: I am hoping that someone has access to share their screen and show the drawings as part of the presentation.

1345
02:34:01,208 --> 02:34:03,609
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have them open on my computer to share.

1346
02:34:06,710 --> 02:34:08,571
[SPEAKER_10]: Jacob, do you have those available?

1347
02:34:08,951 --> 02:34:10,231
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

1348
02:34:11,371 --> 02:34:15,473
[SPEAKER_10]: Alicia, are there plans that are uploaded

1349
02:34:17,632 --> 02:34:19,493
[SPEAKER_10]: on the city that you might be able to walk through?

1350
02:34:19,513 --> 02:34:23,636
[SPEAKER_13]: Hold on, yes.

1351
02:34:24,956 --> 02:34:31,540
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, I still had the previous project open.

1352
02:34:35,002 --> 02:34:38,284
[SPEAKER_14]: 290 Salem Street, final application materials.

1353
02:34:38,824 --> 02:34:40,485
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry for interrupting, I have it pulled up.

1354
02:34:40,505 --> 02:34:41,006
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1355
02:34:47,288 --> 02:34:47,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much.

1356
02:34:48,468 --> 02:34:49,008
[SPEAKER_03]: I apologize.

1357
02:34:49,048 --> 02:34:54,610
[SPEAKER_03]: I figured it was like the last presentation that my drawings would just be tagged on to the architectural things.

1358
02:34:54,650 --> 02:34:56,390
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate you pulling it up for me.

1359
02:34:57,390 --> 02:35:00,171
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, I'm Katja Posadlo with Verdant Landscape Architecture.

1360
02:35:01,771 --> 02:35:17,175
[SPEAKER_03]: We approach this project with the primary goals of supporting the mixed-use program of the building design, but also to really enhance the public realm and the streetscapes, since we have two fairly significant frontages, both on Salem and Park Street.

1361
02:35:18,716 --> 02:35:26,202
[SPEAKER_03]: When I first visited this site, what really struck me were the two wonderful street trees that are out front on Salem Street.

1362
02:35:26,242 --> 02:35:29,965
[SPEAKER_03]: They're two London plane trees that are pretty good sized out there.

1363
02:35:29,985 --> 02:35:37,130
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, they're the kind of trees that have the really pretty bark patterning, so they look nice even in the winter.

1364
02:35:37,210 --> 02:35:38,831
[SPEAKER_03]: They have really good interest in the winter.

1365
02:35:39,972 --> 02:35:51,634
[SPEAKER_03]: So our plan shows that these trees will be protected and enhanced with actually slightly enlarged tree wells along the curb line to support their continued root growth to support them as they age.

1366
02:35:53,235 --> 02:36:09,098
[SPEAKER_03]: We also show additional plant beds along the frontage of those commercial uses that were described and in front of the parking area that you see in the plan here at the back of the sidewalk to develop a really nice green backdrop to that sidewalk experience.

1367
02:36:10,419 --> 02:36:23,132
[SPEAKER_03]: And those plant beds are in keeping with the planted frontages at both of the abutters on Salem Street to the east and then further north on Park Street up the page there.

1368
02:36:24,335 --> 02:36:27,978
[SPEAKER_03]: And then to highlight each of the doorway entrances, we're proposing a unit paving.

1369
02:36:28,738 --> 02:36:43,128
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what's shown in that sort of grayish purple color in all the doorway areas, both to the commercial spaces of Salem Street, and then also to the residential lobby area and the bike room that is shown off of Park Street.

1370
02:36:44,739 --> 02:36:57,742
[SPEAKER_03]: We're also proposing to provide a couple of benches out in front of the retail to make it more welcoming, provide some seating opportunities, and a few other furnishings to note include some visitor bike racks out on Salem Street.

1371
02:36:57,762 --> 02:37:00,183
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got a couple in the furnishing zone there.

1372
02:37:00,583 --> 02:37:08,905
[SPEAKER_03]: We have three additional bike racks for visitor bike parking in front of the lobby entrance on Park Street, so that's a total of 10

1373
02:37:10,805 --> 02:37:17,759
[SPEAKER_03]: temporary or visitor bike parking spaces and that's in addition to the interior bike storage room for the residential use.

1374
02:37:19,392 --> 02:37:23,814
[SPEAKER_03]: We've carved out some green space within the surface parking area outside that building footprint.

1375
02:37:24,974 --> 02:37:31,316
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see here in the sort of northern corners to provide some shade and some buffers up towards the neighborhood there.

1376
02:37:31,736 --> 02:37:38,238
[SPEAKER_03]: And also along those property lines at the side and the rear, we're proposing a wood fence.

1377
02:37:38,278 --> 02:37:43,640
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see the imagery on the bottom of the sheet there for the six foot height solid wood board fence.

1378
02:37:44,815 --> 02:37:51,180
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the last amenity area that I wanted to point out would be the lawn space that spills out from the retail zone.

1379
02:37:52,041 --> 02:37:59,788
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there's direct access from the commercial space on the ground floor on the right-hand side there to the side yard area.

1380
02:37:59,808 --> 02:38:08,755
[SPEAKER_03]: And we thought it could support some additional, maybe like a lunch area or something for employees to come and have just a little bit of green space and respite from work.

1381
02:38:08,895 --> 02:38:11,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Or maybe it's part of the retail use spills out there a little bit.

1382
02:38:14,037 --> 02:38:19,260
[SPEAKER_03]: And at the very least to provide a nice green backdrop and something to see from the windows there.

1383
02:38:19,280 --> 02:38:23,083
[SPEAKER_03]: And that sums it up for the landscape point of view.

1384
02:38:23,723 --> 02:38:29,067
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll pass it back to whoever needs to present any more pieces of our project.

1385
02:38:29,247 --> 02:38:29,587
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1386
02:38:31,568 --> 02:38:31,808
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.

1387
02:38:31,828 --> 02:38:34,250
[SPEAKER_09]: Patrick, do you want to walk through some of the engineering?

1388
02:38:44,142 --> 02:38:46,724
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe that Patrick needs to be unmuted, Patrick Bauer.

1389
02:38:46,744 --> 02:38:50,066
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, I clicked it.

1390
02:38:50,106 --> 02:38:50,906
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to click it again.

1391
02:38:50,926 --> 02:38:52,567
[SPEAKER_13]: There you go.

1392
02:38:56,829 --> 02:38:58,230
[SPEAKER_13]: We cannot hear you, Patrick.

1393
02:38:58,490 --> 02:38:59,591
[SPEAKER_13]: You're not showing unmuted.

1394
02:39:01,973 --> 02:39:04,174
[SPEAKER_13]: You're not showing muted, but we cannot hear your words.

1395
02:39:40,418 --> 02:39:42,219
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not sure what the issue is here.

1396
02:39:42,660 --> 02:39:43,600
[SPEAKER_13]: It worked that time.

1397
02:39:44,060 --> 02:39:44,421
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, good.

1398
02:39:45,021 --> 02:39:45,461
[SPEAKER_11]: We hear you.

1399
02:39:45,801 --> 02:39:46,062
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, good.

1400
02:39:46,982 --> 02:39:47,442
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank goodness.

1401
02:39:49,544 --> 02:39:55,027
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'll jump right into it and be as brief as possible.

1402
02:39:55,067 --> 02:39:56,108
[SPEAKER_11]: So you see the site here.

1403
02:39:57,649 --> 02:39:58,549
[SPEAKER_11]: You see as you follow.

1404
02:39:59,972 --> 02:40:03,997
[SPEAKER_11]: Through the middle of the site, you can see where the footprint of the building is outside that area.

1405
02:40:04,017 --> 02:40:12,068
[SPEAKER_11]: You see some shading that is going to be paving to the limits of the property.

1406
02:40:12,228 --> 02:40:17,615
[SPEAKER_11]: You see the parking underneath the parking underneath as Jacob mentioned is access from Park Street.

1407
02:40:19,238 --> 02:40:30,104
[SPEAKER_11]: We have down at the bottom left corner of the facility or the new building, we have domestic and fire water services going in as well as a sewer service.

1408
02:40:31,045 --> 02:40:42,051
[SPEAKER_11]: And then a new drainage pipe service going out to a proposed manhole, which is near the entrance to the street level parking.

1409
02:40:43,252 --> 02:40:46,415
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's where our overflow from our stormwater system will be.

1410
02:40:46,956 --> 02:41:02,070
[SPEAKER_11]: The stormwater is a subsurface system of three dry wells embedded in stone and will capture runoff from the roof as well as a series of catch basins throughout the site that will pick up runoff that lands on that paved area.

1411
02:41:04,645 --> 02:41:13,092
[SPEAKER_11]: We did receive some comments from the engineering department that will incorporate into the next revision of the site plan.

1412
02:41:15,474 --> 02:41:18,296
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's really it in a nutshell for the civil portion.

1413
02:41:26,322 --> 02:41:27,543
[SPEAKER_11]: Unless somebody has questions.

1414
02:41:39,319 --> 02:41:39,919
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks, Patrick.

1415
02:41:39,999 --> 02:41:43,520
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure that's all from the applicant side.

1416
02:41:43,540 --> 02:41:45,881
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm happy to answer any questions the board may have.

1417
02:41:48,061 --> 02:41:48,522
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1418
02:41:48,662 --> 02:41:53,123
[SPEAKER_17]: I should have actually had you keep up the engineering documents.

1419
02:41:54,043 --> 02:41:57,784
[SPEAKER_17]: One of the things of note were the dumpsters.

1420
02:41:59,184 --> 02:42:03,386
[SPEAKER_17]: Can you explain how you could access those two rectangular dumpsters?

1421
02:42:07,016 --> 02:42:14,901
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, so actually what we're going to do is they'll be wheeled and they'll be delivered to the curb side.

1422
02:42:15,022 --> 02:42:21,406
[SPEAKER_11]: It's my understanding unless, Adam, there's been a change in that perspective.

1423
02:42:21,486 --> 02:42:27,710
[SPEAKER_11]: But so yeah, so there'll be wheeled dumpsters that will be taken out and then emptied at the street level.

1424
02:42:27,730 --> 02:42:29,792
[SPEAKER_17]: So help me understand.

1425
02:42:30,092 --> 02:42:32,754
[SPEAKER_17]: So I can see how you can get the one next to the car out.

1426
02:42:33,014 --> 02:42:34,415
[SPEAKER_17]: How do you get the one behind that out?

1427
02:42:35,234 --> 02:42:37,876
[SPEAKER_11]: So they'll have to be taken out in series.

1428
02:42:40,698 --> 02:42:44,620
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually have an updated site plan, if I can share mine.

1429
02:42:44,640 --> 02:42:46,462
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not sure if I can share my screen.

1430
02:42:46,482 --> 02:42:49,123
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see here.

1431
02:42:49,143 --> 02:42:53,566
[SPEAKER_11]: Alicia, I don't know if you provide me the ability to do that.

1432
02:42:53,847 --> 02:42:54,847
[SPEAKER_13]: Just gave you permission.

1433
02:42:54,867 --> 02:42:55,648
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, thank you.

1434
02:42:59,670 --> 02:43:01,111
[SPEAKER_13]: As you're doing that, will you explain

1435
02:43:02,272 --> 02:43:07,141
[SPEAKER_13]: between the dumpsters on your plan and on the site plan, they were different.

1436
02:43:08,223 --> 02:43:13,753
[SPEAKER_11]: Right, so this is a revised plan that came up

1437
02:43:15,021 --> 02:43:25,686
[SPEAKER_11]: After our original submission, the city had formally changed their stormwater requirements, and we had some additional, some landscape stuff that we incorporated into a subsequent plan.

1438
02:43:25,706 --> 02:43:29,648
[SPEAKER_11]: So you see that this one's a little bit different from the one we saw previously.

1439
02:43:30,068 --> 02:43:33,830
[SPEAKER_11]: It has some landscaping here that Kathy had talked about.

1440
02:43:34,250 --> 02:43:35,591
[SPEAKER_11]: But again, here are those dumpsters.

1441
02:43:35,631 --> 02:43:38,472
[SPEAKER_11]: So those dumpsters will be wheeled out to the street level.

1442
02:43:38,952 --> 02:43:40,413
[SPEAKER_11]: I assume you can see my cursor moving.

1443
02:43:40,893 --> 02:44:04,638
[SPEAKER_11]: or at least wheeled out so you know so it's going to be a you know a solid waste vehicle is going to have to access those so either they would traverse underneath that that level that you know the second level would be the overhang and access those dumpsters or they will be wheeled out so you'd you've probably all seen those dumpsters they're covered typical metal dumpsters but they're on wheels so that they can be wheeled out

1444
02:44:12,619 --> 02:44:16,130
[SPEAKER_17]: We don't have the city engineer here to say whether or not that that would be.

1445
02:44:16,150 --> 02:44:19,059
[SPEAKER_17]: You said that you had received his.

1446
02:44:20,419 --> 02:44:23,920
[SPEAKER_17]: actual comments, is that something that he referenced?

1447
02:44:23,940 --> 02:44:29,102
[SPEAKER_11]: We did some preliminary comments, yes, and I don't believe there was a comment on there about the dumpsters.

1448
02:44:29,142 --> 02:44:30,422
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't say off the top of my head.

1449
02:44:30,442 --> 02:44:37,304
[SPEAKER_11]: There was, you know, there was maybe a dozen comments, but nothing that was going to really affect the design.

1450
02:44:37,324 --> 02:44:42,346
[SPEAKER_11]: It was more or less, you know, some additional sidewalk replacement and things like that.

1451
02:44:42,366 --> 02:44:46,187
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't recall, Madam Chair, that there was issues related to the dumpster.

1452
02:44:46,207 --> 02:44:46,967
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1453
02:44:49,800 --> 02:44:51,402
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I'm sorry, I don't have his comments up.

1454
02:44:52,003 --> 02:44:52,523
[SPEAKER_17]: No, thank you.

1455
02:44:52,544 --> 02:44:59,572
[SPEAKER_17]: Alicia, did you have any questions regarding this?

1456
02:45:02,271 --> 02:45:05,794
[SPEAKER_13]: Madam Chair, there were a couple of notes that I'd put in.

1457
02:45:06,194 --> 02:45:06,815
[SPEAKER_13]: I have more.

1458
02:45:06,835 --> 02:45:09,357
[SPEAKER_13]: I just didn't know if that- Oh, about the dumpsters?

1459
02:45:09,377 --> 02:45:10,278
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1460
02:45:11,099 --> 02:45:20,087
[SPEAKER_13]: No, but given that this is going to be continued, I think that we might just ask for some images.

1461
02:45:20,207 --> 02:45:22,709
[SPEAKER_13]: I picture a dumpster, it can't get wheeled out.

1462
02:45:22,749 --> 02:45:26,692
[SPEAKER_13]: You're obviously picturing something much smaller if you want to provide that.

1463
02:45:27,153 --> 02:45:27,473
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

1464
02:45:27,653 --> 02:45:28,314
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

1465
02:45:30,866 --> 02:45:34,889
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm perhaps used to dealing with much larger dumpsters than you're thinking of.

1466
02:45:35,009 --> 02:45:35,329
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

1467
02:45:35,350 --> 02:45:35,490
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1468
02:45:38,592 --> 02:45:39,292
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1469
02:45:39,592 --> 02:45:57,064
[SPEAKER_17]: And so going back to the design, if you can go back to the design, actually, and one of the things that was mentioned is that you wanted it to fit into the context of the lot, like the corner of the way that the, not the,

1470
02:45:58,619 --> 02:46:02,003
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sorry, this was the actual design of the building on the outside.

1471
02:46:02,023 --> 02:46:03,784
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what I'm looking for now.

1472
02:46:04,845 --> 02:46:05,907
[SPEAKER_11]: Back to the architecturals.

1473
02:46:06,367 --> 02:46:07,048
[SPEAKER_17]: Back to, yes.

1474
02:46:20,455 --> 02:46:31,745
[SPEAKER_17]: Right there on the corner, it was mentioned how we wanted it to fit into the context of the lot and then play off the buildings across, but how does it fit into the context of everything else that's there?

1475
02:46:32,506 --> 02:46:39,873
[SPEAKER_17]: Can we have some site plans to show how it would actually fit into that context, like something from the back, the top, the side?

1476
02:47:16,689 --> 02:47:22,955
[SPEAKER_17]: And if you don't have them now, it can definitely be for the next time you before the board.

1477
02:47:22,975 --> 02:47:26,719
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's right.

1478
02:47:27,059 --> 02:47:30,283
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Madam Chair, I think that's directed towards me, the architecture team.

1479
02:47:31,724 --> 02:47:35,768
[SPEAKER_00]: We will have something prepared for next time.

1480
02:47:36,489 --> 02:47:39,672
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a few kind of 3D context imaging.

1481
02:47:40,274 --> 02:47:50,016
[SPEAKER_00]: just to show how we have a 40-foot pretty much max height we want to hit with the parapet and just showing how that contextually fits into some of the neighboring buildings.

1482
02:47:51,356 --> 02:48:01,099
[SPEAKER_00]: Massing-wise, it fits context well and holds the street corner, especially with what's across the street and what's coming up and down Salem Street.

1483
02:48:01,619 --> 02:48:07,000
[SPEAKER_00]: We can show either site section or a 3D image like this that shows the building.

1484
02:48:07,400 --> 02:48:10,141
[SPEAKER_00]: with its neighboring context, massing wise.

1485
02:48:10,961 --> 02:48:19,083
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was kind of talking about fitting in, I was talking more materiality and visual look more so than the massing.

1486
02:48:19,103 --> 02:48:28,166
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like the one story building that was here before didn't really hold the corner as well as something like this, but we will certainly have that prepared for next time.

1487
02:48:28,186 --> 02:48:30,106
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1488
02:48:30,666 --> 02:48:32,807
[SPEAKER_17]: Vice Chair Heidemann, you have a question?

1489
02:48:35,208 --> 02:48:42,492
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I would encourage the applicant to refer to the prior presentation and some of those visuals that were provided.

1490
02:48:43,093 --> 02:49:02,784
[SPEAKER_16]: Obviously, one project is not the same as the other, but I think that they offered some helpful perspective about how their project fit into the neighborhood and to speak specifically to the design considerations that SL House Group has made for the materiality and aesthetics of this proposed project.

1491
02:49:04,953 --> 02:49:07,654
[SPEAKER_16]: I would encourage you to maybe simplify a little bit.

1492
02:49:08,594 --> 02:49:14,476
[SPEAKER_16]: You're referencing the bay windows, the siding, the brick.

1493
02:49:15,477 --> 02:49:24,680
[SPEAKER_16]: But I would encourage you to maybe take a deeper understanding of how those materials are used in the surrounding context.

1494
02:49:24,700 --> 02:49:32,763
[SPEAKER_16]: For example, the building across the street, the bay windows are wood with ornamental designs.

1495
02:49:33,477 --> 02:49:36,019
[SPEAKER_16]: um, that extrude out of a brick volume.

1496
02:49:36,039 --> 02:49:42,082
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, and then the, the base level, um, is, is highly ornamental.

1497
02:49:42,202 --> 02:49:45,664
[SPEAKER_16]: So maybe think about some of those things with the materiality of your building.

1498
02:49:46,404 --> 02:49:50,907
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, additionally, you mentioned that this is occupying the corner, um, on the ground level.

1499
02:49:51,147 --> 02:49:51,387
[SPEAKER_16]: Sure.

1500
02:49:51,407 --> 02:49:59,111
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, if you go up to the, the two flights or the two stories above, um, we have negative space for those balconies.

1501
02:49:59,692 --> 02:50:01,673
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, you know, perhaps those balconies could be

1502
02:50:02,398 --> 02:50:12,200
[SPEAKER_16]: adjusted to shift into the volume of the building to, you know, to your point, to occupy the corner, provide a strong presence.

1503
02:50:12,900 --> 02:50:15,341
[SPEAKER_16]: Because I really do see a lot of potential with this project.

1504
02:50:16,141 --> 02:50:23,783
[SPEAKER_16]: But I'd encourage you just to kind of simplify and, you know, maybe make some more direct connections to the aesthetics in the area.

1505
02:50:24,263 --> 02:50:31,905
[SPEAKER_16]: And also, like, feel free to have like some fun, like you don't have to do one for one, you know, maybe instead of these being, you know, three window

1506
02:50:32,832 --> 02:50:44,558
[SPEAKER_16]: uh, bays, you know, maybe they're more of a abstract volume to match, um, you know, match the sharper angles that you have in your, your building facade as well.

1507
02:50:46,439 --> 02:50:47,540
[SPEAKER_00]: That was really great advice.

1508
02:50:47,560 --> 02:50:48,620
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.

1509
02:50:49,561 --> 02:50:49,721
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

1510
02:50:50,281 --> 02:50:56,444
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for, um, for providing these drawings for us to, to, you know, provide feedback on really appreciate it.

1511
02:51:00,105 --> 02:51:06,649
[SPEAKER_17]: And do you have any actual shadow studies, especially with it being on the corner like that?

1512
02:51:06,669 --> 02:51:07,950
[SPEAKER_00]: Not today.

1513
02:51:09,211 --> 02:51:09,431
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

1514
02:51:12,073 --> 02:51:14,534
[SPEAKER_17]: That would be something for consideration, just to let you know.

1515
02:51:14,554 --> 02:51:15,415
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1516
02:51:17,236 --> 02:51:26,142
[SPEAKER_17]: And one of the comments, actually, that came up with, if you can clarify it, 30% of the usable open space, that was calculated.

1517
02:51:27,392 --> 02:51:32,597
[SPEAKER_17]: it would help if you have a plan that actually clearly shows that open space.

1518
02:51:36,920 --> 02:51:39,523
[SPEAKER_17]: And this goes back to engineering.

1519
02:51:40,564 --> 02:51:47,310
[SPEAKER_17]: But before you go, sorry, not to go back and forth, but on this one, on the ground floor, actually, sorry.

1520
02:51:47,490 --> 02:51:48,571
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

1521
02:51:50,152 --> 02:51:53,255
[SPEAKER_09]: So you're okay with my ground floor plan?

1522
02:51:53,335 --> 02:51:53,495
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1523
02:51:56,160 --> 02:51:57,860
[SPEAKER_17]: How did you calculate the open space?

1524
02:51:59,781 --> 02:52:01,161
[SPEAKER_17]: If you can clearly show that.

1525
02:52:01,181 --> 02:52:02,242
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1526
02:52:13,424 --> 02:52:23,807
[SPEAKER_17]: And then there were some traffic comments actually, the parking lot allows for at least one, the parking lot should strongly consider

1527
02:52:25,942 --> 02:52:29,483
[SPEAKER_17]: allowing for parking space associated with commercial uses.

1528
02:52:35,825 --> 02:52:41,707
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's just to enhance the area.

1529
02:52:59,323 --> 02:53:10,262
[SPEAKER_10]: Just to clarify on that point, that's a recommendation from traffic, but would that have an impact on or be required as part of the site plan approval?

1530
02:53:14,273 --> 02:53:20,658
[SPEAKER_17]: One of the things that the city is concerned about is that residential parking always takes precedence over the commercial.

1531
02:53:20,858 --> 02:53:24,721
[SPEAKER_17]: And then the commercial will have to come back and get like a parking.

1532
02:53:24,781 --> 02:53:31,507
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's strongly recommended that the board requires a parking space for commercial at this point.

1533
02:53:32,848 --> 02:53:34,249
[SPEAKER_10]: So one per unit?

1534
02:53:34,749 --> 02:53:38,272
[SPEAKER_17]: One per unit, allowing for parking.

1535
02:53:38,853 --> 02:53:42,736
[SPEAKER_17]: Alicia, can you clarify the city's preference for parking there?

1536
02:53:46,894 --> 02:53:48,416
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, finding my zoom button.

1537
02:53:49,197 --> 02:53:50,078
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, so.

1538
02:53:51,059 --> 02:54:04,334
[SPEAKER_13]: The, we're looking at whether this is transit oriented or not, we'll ask the, the applicant to just show that there's more than 3 buses in a direction to comply with transit oriented.

1539
02:54:06,546 --> 02:54:12,088
[SPEAKER_13]: If it's not so not transit oriented would be 1.5 spots per unit transit oriented.

1540
02:54:12,128 --> 02:54:15,889
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we had discussed that in the office that we had discussed that with Danielle.

1541
02:54:16,289 --> 02:54:24,351
[SPEAKER_13]: There was an attempt to do more parking in a way that literally did not fit on this site, and we actually sent that back to the applicant.

1542
02:54:25,011 --> 02:54:27,932
[SPEAKER_13]: Because we couldn't figure out how the parking literally worked.

1543
02:54:28,672 --> 02:54:37,534
[SPEAKER_13]: Pardon me if I am not fully remembering the conversation, but I do believe that we thought this was going to qualify as transit-oriented development.

1544
02:54:39,154 --> 02:54:40,374
[SPEAKER_13]: And you had the requirement.

1545
02:54:41,775 --> 02:54:42,755
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, it is getting late.

1546
02:54:42,795 --> 02:54:49,936
[SPEAKER_13]: I looked at that number earlier today, and I think that the 0.8 is in compliance if this is considered transit-oriented development.

1547
02:54:50,816 --> 02:54:52,957
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, it's 0.8 for dwelling unit.

1548
02:54:53,697 --> 02:54:54,057
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1549
02:54:55,008 --> 02:55:02,230
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, it was our understanding that this qualified due to high frequency transit in the area.

1550
02:55:02,270 --> 02:55:12,192
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's one of the reasons why the parking requirement was not cited on the building commissioners refusal letter.

1551
02:55:12,212 --> 02:55:15,613
[SPEAKER_13]: Right, that he actually agreed that this would qualify.

1552
02:55:15,753 --> 02:55:21,495
[SPEAKER_13]: So eight spots for seven units and two commercial was allowable at this location.

1553
02:55:23,703 --> 02:55:29,068
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I think how that parking is managed is something the applicant will want to consider.

1554
02:55:29,988 --> 02:55:33,471
[SPEAKER_13]: Will there in fact need to be a spot for the commercial?

1555
02:55:34,252 --> 02:55:45,302
[SPEAKER_13]: But we didn't see any way to add any additional parking to this spot without creating additional curb cuts, which was very much not desirable by the planning office and the engineering office.

1556
02:55:47,944 --> 02:55:49,045
[SPEAKER_13]: Does that help?

1557
02:55:59,961 --> 02:56:06,466
[SPEAKER_13]: There was the comment, so the traffic, it was just forwarded to the applicant today.

1558
02:56:06,706 --> 02:56:11,770
[SPEAKER_13]: Because of the nature of this back and forth, we asked for preliminary comments from the department heads.

1559
02:56:12,290 --> 02:56:24,539
[SPEAKER_13]: The Director of Traffic and Transportation said that the parking lot should consider allowing one of the spaces to be associated with the commercial uses because we have been getting cases

1560
02:56:26,061 --> 02:56:33,649
[SPEAKER_13]: residential taking precedent over commercial, and then often the commercial then comes and looks for an accommodation from the city at a later date.

1561
02:56:34,690 --> 02:56:47,924
[SPEAKER_13]: So understanding that, figuring that out, there isn't really like a parking lot nearby that employees could park in and get a business permit in this area.

1562
02:56:52,697 --> 02:56:59,182
[SPEAKER_13]: However, I will say that the planning office really thinks that a coffee shop or something like that.

1563
02:56:59,842 --> 02:57:04,346
[SPEAKER_13]: On this corner, I do encourage you when you show the context.

1564
02:57:06,047 --> 02:57:06,928
[SPEAKER_13]: It may not be.

1565
02:57:08,337 --> 02:57:12,380
[SPEAKER_13]: The boards both planning and CBA may not be familiar with the site context.

1566
02:57:12,980 --> 02:57:18,764
[SPEAKER_13]: There is a elementary school essentially across the street from this location.

1567
02:57:19,844 --> 02:57:33,373
[SPEAKER_13]: So we do think that there is really high potential for a coffee shop or I hate to say a candy store, something that would be of interest to the youth or preferably the parents at this location.

1568
02:57:38,945 --> 02:57:43,307
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1569
02:57:44,147 --> 02:57:44,427
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1570
02:57:46,008 --> 02:57:49,509
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, I know it was Mr. Bauer with the presenters.

1571
02:57:49,529 --> 02:57:50,070
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I'm sorry.

1572
02:57:50,090 --> 02:57:53,931
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted to clarify for the record, Madam Chair, that I looked at the engineer's comments.

1573
02:57:53,951 --> 02:57:58,293
[SPEAKER_11]: He did have a comment about the dumpsters, but more or less how we would access.

1574
02:57:58,333 --> 02:58:00,774
[SPEAKER_11]: He was asking if there was an additional curb cut for that.

1575
02:58:01,794 --> 02:58:03,935
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just, I didn't want to leave that issue hanging.

1576
02:58:04,615 --> 02:58:06,616
[SPEAKER_11]: I just, I looked it up really quickly and wanted to let you know.

1577
02:58:07,056 --> 02:58:07,497
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1578
02:58:20,070 --> 02:58:31,341
[SPEAKER_17]: And to reiterate Director Hunt's comment, this is a huge opportunity to pretty much live in that ground space for the pedestrian experience at this point.

1579
02:58:32,202 --> 02:58:35,725
[SPEAKER_17]: Keep that in mind, especially with how it's situated.

1580
02:58:40,528 --> 02:58:49,398
[SPEAKER_13]: If I may, Madam Chair, I think that it would be helpful when you return to get some better views of what the ground space can look like.

1581
02:58:50,059 --> 02:58:55,245
[SPEAKER_13]: This architecture view does not reflect the site plan that was presented to us.

1582
02:58:55,645 --> 02:58:57,607
[SPEAKER_13]: The site plan had plantings along.

1583
02:58:58,448 --> 02:59:16,281
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, Salem or Park Street and Salem Street, the architectural view does not, if we could have something that shows us actually what the pedestrian experience is going to be, I think that would be really helpful because at this time the plans kind of conflict with the two different views conflict with each other.

1584
02:59:24,246 --> 02:59:26,368
[SPEAKER_13]: I would like to just note that, um,

1585
02:59:28,596 --> 02:59:30,577
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I actually have now, I'm just second guessing myself.

1586
02:59:32,498 --> 02:59:36,441
[SPEAKER_13]: We appreciate the solar on the roof from the city's perspective.

1587
02:59:37,342 --> 02:59:51,931
[SPEAKER_13]: And I was thinking, but I think actually the solar ordinance is six units or higher, requires solar on the roof, which is something we may wanna note for future conditions, but it is part of our zoning.

1588
02:59:53,072 --> 02:59:54,472
[SPEAKER_13]: So we appreciate that.

1589
02:59:54,993 --> 02:59:57,474
[SPEAKER_13]: And we do ask that you provide

1590
02:59:58,675 --> 03:00:06,854
[SPEAKER_13]: solar assessment showing that the amount of solar you're displaying up there is actually practical.

1591
03:00:29,380 --> 03:00:30,221
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Director Hunt.

1592
03:00:30,241 --> 03:00:32,442
[SPEAKER_17]: Does any of the board members have questions?

1593
03:00:34,744 --> 03:00:36,845
[SPEAKER_17]: Or any input at this time?

1594
03:00:40,167 --> 03:00:40,968
[SPEAKER_17]: Anything to add?

1595
03:00:42,069 --> 03:00:43,990
[SPEAKER_12]: I just have a clarification on the process.

1596
03:00:44,050 --> 03:00:55,178
[SPEAKER_12]: So basically what we're looking to do tonight is continue this to, I believe, our next meeting, which I don't have the calendar in front of me.

1597
03:00:56,815 --> 03:00:58,236
[SPEAKER_17]: It would have to be a date certain.

1598
03:00:58,276 --> 03:01:04,038
[SPEAKER_17]: We're not able to approve anything prior to ZBA's actions.

1599
03:01:04,558 --> 03:01:05,059
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, okay.

1600
03:01:05,099 --> 03:01:16,263
[SPEAKER_12]: So we'd be continuing to... A date certain after ZBA's... Yeah, a date certain after ZBA.

1601
03:01:16,283 --> 03:01:20,385
[SPEAKER_12]: At which point they'd come back.

1602
03:01:21,485 --> 03:01:31,489
[SPEAKER_17]: And if ZBA, and I don't want to speak anything into existence or anything like that, but say, for instance, ZBA denies their variance, they're back at square one for a design.

1603
03:01:31,569 --> 03:01:37,491
[SPEAKER_17]: So there's not much we can say or review tonight.

1604
03:01:38,331 --> 03:01:40,132
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, approve tonight.

1605
03:01:42,192 --> 03:01:43,773
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, I have the list.

1606
03:01:44,453 --> 03:01:44,653
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

1607
03:01:44,693 --> 03:01:48,975
[SPEAKER_13]: It's my recommendation that so you've let them know a number of different things.

1608
03:01:49,630 --> 03:01:53,834
[SPEAKER_13]: additional information you would want to see when they return.

1609
03:01:55,896 --> 03:02:01,862
[SPEAKER_13]: Your next meeting is scheduled for March 6th, if the applicant felt that that was soon enough.

1610
03:02:02,722 --> 03:02:05,885
[SPEAKER_13]: The ZBA's hearing is next week, February 29th.

1611
03:02:06,606 --> 03:02:07,807
[SPEAKER_13]: They meet once a month.

1612
03:02:09,601 --> 03:02:16,187
[SPEAKER_13]: Assuming that they close on the 29th, would you be ready to come back on March 6th?

1613
03:02:16,688 --> 03:02:23,875
[SPEAKER_13]: The meeting after that scheduled for this board is March 20th, if you, for some reason, felt you needed more time.

1614
03:02:27,618 --> 03:02:30,981
[SPEAKER_10]: Just to clarify, the options would be March 6th or March 20th?

1615
03:02:32,638 --> 03:02:34,099
[SPEAKER_13]: Unless you'd like dates further out.

1616
03:02:35,280 --> 03:02:40,803
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I would probably it seems as though most of this is, is in Jacob's realm.

1617
03:02:40,823 --> 03:02:47,166
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think, you know, potentially, you could give us an indication as to as to what is feasible.

1618
03:02:47,226 --> 03:02:51,589
[SPEAKER_10]: Certainly, I think we want to make it realistic, if that would be the March 20 date, as opposed to March 6.

1619
03:02:51,929 --> 03:02:54,090
[SPEAKER_10]: But Jacob, what are your thoughts on time?

1620
03:02:54,110 --> 03:02:58,453
[SPEAKER_13]: You're muted.

1621
03:02:59,997 --> 03:03:00,397
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying.

1622
03:03:00,717 --> 03:03:01,858
[SPEAKER_00]: My computer is a little tired.

1623
03:03:01,878 --> 03:03:04,500
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been solid hours.

1624
03:03:06,621 --> 03:03:13,466
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, for me, just hearing the board's comments tonight, you know, looking for some more 3D views and more context.

1625
03:03:13,486 --> 03:03:17,269
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not necessarily upgrading the design in that much.

1626
03:03:17,289 --> 03:03:19,050
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just providing more content.

1627
03:03:19,624 --> 03:03:26,947
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think that at this point, just being completely transparent, these are still a schematic level design.

1628
03:03:27,527 --> 03:03:33,569
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't completely detailed out the facade in terms of, is it a terracotta, is it a brick?

1629
03:03:34,609 --> 03:03:36,770
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think things like the shadow study,

1630
03:03:37,647 --> 03:03:42,670
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of 3D context renderings can definitely be achieved by the March 6 deadline.

1631
03:03:43,050 --> 03:03:55,077
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we had to, by the recommendation of this board or by the ZBA, take the design back in-house and start taking things apart and putting it back together, that's a different conversation.

1632
03:03:55,377 --> 03:04:03,082
[SPEAKER_00]: But it sounds like, and correct me if I'm wrong, you are just looking for a little bit more information similar to the presentation you just saw before.

1633
03:04:03,981 --> 03:04:04,562
[SPEAKER_17]: Exactly.

1634
03:04:04,682 --> 03:04:10,887
[SPEAKER_17]: And just keep in mind that we understand that the ZBA needs some kind of design and that it's just a schematic at this point.

1635
03:04:10,947 --> 03:04:18,133
[SPEAKER_17]: So you want to keep in mind how much more of a percentage of design are you going to get to before you bring it before us.

1636
03:04:18,574 --> 03:04:23,558
[SPEAKER_17]: Because we're giving you this information that we're going to be looking for when you come back.

1637
03:04:27,694 --> 03:04:35,378
[SPEAKER_10]: And when would the board, I mean, if you're looking at March 6th, when would the board want to have the plans submitted?

1638
03:04:35,438 --> 03:04:41,802
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I also want to be realistic time-wise being that a week from Friday, for example, is March 1st.

1639
03:04:43,222 --> 03:04:47,965
[SPEAKER_10]: Would you want them, is it a 48 hours beforehand, is it a week beforehand?

1640
03:04:50,423 --> 03:04:51,864
[SPEAKER_17]: Alicia, what's the timeline for this?

1641
03:04:51,884 --> 03:05:00,571
[SPEAKER_13]: Madam Chair, I believe the preference of the board is to receive the files at least the Friday before, with the understanding that we close at 1230 on Friday.

1642
03:05:00,631 --> 03:05:04,414
[SPEAKER_13]: So we appreciate receiving them before we leave for the day.

1643
03:05:04,854 --> 03:05:07,276
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, before we technically close for the day.

1644
03:05:11,599 --> 03:05:14,021
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the shortest window.

1645
03:05:14,201 --> 03:05:16,423
[SPEAKER_00]: So pardon me.

1646
03:05:16,483 --> 03:05:17,784
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be March the 1st.

1647
03:05:18,364 --> 03:05:18,985
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct me if I'm wrong.

1648
03:05:19,507 --> 03:05:20,607
[SPEAKER_13]: We would need the files.

1649
03:05:23,268 --> 03:05:24,309
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fine with me, Adam.

1650
03:05:26,410 --> 03:05:28,470
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, then we can we can aim for that.

1651
03:05:28,550 --> 03:05:34,672
[SPEAKER_10]: And certainly if we if we come up, you know, against any deadlines, we can coordinate Alicia with with your department.

1652
03:05:36,313 --> 03:05:41,415
[SPEAKER_13]: I will say that because this is a public hearing, that's to be continued to a date and time certain.

1653
03:05:42,129 --> 03:05:55,336
[SPEAKER_13]: If before the public hearing, you become aware that you're not ready, you can let us know that, and the board can open the hearing, continue to a date and time certain, and close the hearing.

1654
03:05:56,157 --> 03:05:58,078
[SPEAKER_13]: We can do that in about three minutes.

1655
03:05:58,138 --> 03:06:02,921
[SPEAKER_13]: I once watched the ZBA do three of them in under five minutes.

1656
03:06:02,941 --> 03:06:07,283
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1657
03:06:10,756 --> 03:06:16,185
[SPEAKER_13]: At this time, it may in fact be the only, I believe it is the only item on the agenda for March 6.

1658
03:06:17,227 --> 03:06:21,695
[SPEAKER_13]: I do want to check that with Danielle because she manages the agenda.

1659
03:06:41,368 --> 03:06:43,269
[SPEAKER_17]: Any other questions from the board?

1660
03:06:48,351 --> 03:06:58,915
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, because we've legally opened a public hearing, we can also do the public comments and that does not mean that we can't open the public comments again at the next meeting.

1661
03:06:58,975 --> 03:07:02,797
[SPEAKER_17]: So I will open them for now if there's members of the public.

1662
03:07:04,727 --> 03:07:10,011
[SPEAKER_17]: Those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature or message Alicia in the comments.

1663
03:07:10,031 --> 03:07:13,994
[SPEAKER_17]: You can also send an email to OCD at medford-ma.gov.

1664
03:07:14,515 --> 03:07:17,837
[SPEAKER_17]: Before providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record.

1665
03:07:17,937 --> 03:07:24,762
[SPEAKER_17]: A reminder to all meeting participants to please refrain from using the chat function to provide comments as it is not a part of the public record.

1666
03:07:25,123 --> 03:07:31,668
[SPEAKER_17]: However, if a participant is having audio or other technical difficulties, this may be entered into the chat to let myself and staff.

1667
03:07:33,063 --> 03:07:34,543
[SPEAKER_17]: Depending on the number, we will limit it.

1668
03:07:35,504 --> 03:07:39,884
[SPEAKER_17]: As of right now, I don't see any hands, so I will say it was about three minutes per person.

1669
03:07:42,545 --> 03:08:00,269
[SPEAKER_17]: Are there any members from the public present that want to... Alicia, have you received any comments, previous comments or emails or letters on this item?

1670
03:08:01,982 --> 03:08:06,448
[SPEAKER_13]: There's nothing in our new email box at this point.

1671
03:08:06,468 --> 03:08:08,952
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to double check with this tab.

1672
03:08:09,012 --> 03:08:09,994
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm checking.

1673
03:08:10,134 --> 03:08:13,939
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't believe that I saw a comments folder for this project.

1674
03:08:13,999 --> 03:08:14,740
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that correct?

1675
03:08:15,221 --> 03:08:15,441
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1676
03:08:19,085 --> 03:08:26,869
[SPEAKER_10]: If I may, I do believe that there were approximately 20 letters of support that were submitted by email by the applicant.

1677
03:08:27,230 --> 03:08:31,873
[SPEAKER_13]: Clem, is this the project that something was hand delivered and scanned in?

1678
03:08:31,893 --> 03:08:40,278
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I was just about to jump in and say as a packet of 20 or so signed support statements, letters.

1679
03:08:42,477 --> 03:08:47,679
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that, are those in, sorry, I lost, are those in the folder for the?

1680
03:08:50,860 --> 03:08:54,521
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it's a 290, stay along support letters.

1681
03:08:57,602 --> 03:08:58,823
[SPEAKER_06]: In the project folder.

1682
03:09:00,123 --> 03:09:07,886
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm, oh, okay, often we'll have a folder called comments, just because that flags it for us, so it's just a single PDF.

1683
03:09:08,586 --> 03:09:09,687
[SPEAKER_13]: And for the board,

1684
03:09:12,367 --> 03:09:13,527
[SPEAKER_13]: They're all identical.

1685
03:09:13,788 --> 03:09:15,908
[SPEAKER_13]: They have the person's name and address.

1686
03:09:16,409 --> 03:09:22,311
[SPEAKER_13]: And it says, please allow this letter to serve as my show of support for the proposed project at 290 Salem Street.

1687
03:09:24,031 --> 03:09:28,773
[SPEAKER_17]: What is the exact number of letters?

1688
03:09:29,213 --> 03:09:31,394
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm trying to see how many pages are in the PDF.

1689
03:09:31,814 --> 03:09:32,215
[SPEAKER_13]: Seven.

1690
03:09:32,235 --> 03:09:32,215
19.

1691
03:09:33,915 --> 03:09:34,415
[SPEAKER_13]: 19.

1692
03:09:33,975 --> 03:09:34,415
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1693
03:09:39,629 --> 03:09:49,935
[SPEAKER_13]: I will say that this is a location that I hear about frequently in the public that people want to know what's going to happen would like to see something built here.

1694
03:09:51,316 --> 03:09:59,520
[SPEAKER_13]: But I don't haven't heard anything specific, like, we haven't received anything formal, other than please build something there already.

1695
03:09:59,580 --> 03:10:07,064
[SPEAKER_13]: They, they jokingly, the kids refer to it as the pit, because it's across the street from the elementary school, where Danielle's children go.

1696
03:10:07,785 --> 03:10:07,945
[SPEAKER_13]: So

1697
03:10:12,015 --> 03:10:14,896
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, we'll take that into record.

1698
03:10:15,036 --> 03:10:17,436
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to close the public comment period.

1699
03:10:17,576 --> 03:10:21,837
[SPEAKER_17]: Just keep in mind that we will reopen when there's additional materials to consider.

1700
03:10:24,617 --> 03:10:31,338
[SPEAKER_17]: So again, the board's not going to consider criteria for approval on the site plan review and special permit this evening.

1701
03:10:31,358 --> 03:10:39,960
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to allow the zoning board to review the variances before completing that process, all those two processes.

1702
03:10:43,358 --> 03:10:56,868
[SPEAKER_17]: I would not, at this point, I'm not sure if we should deliberate on anything until the proponent is before us, but I'm open to hear what the rest of the board is saying or thinking.

1703
03:11:01,172 --> 03:11:10,358
[SPEAKER_12]: I would think for now we should continue and deliberate when we have additional materials in front of us.

1704
03:11:11,539 --> 03:11:12,280
[SPEAKER_12]: But that's just my thought.

1705
03:11:13,735 --> 03:11:14,375
[SPEAKER_17]: That's my thought.

1706
03:11:15,435 --> 03:11:16,956
[SPEAKER_17]: Vice Chair Hederman.

1707
03:11:17,916 --> 03:11:18,916
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Chair McPherson.

1708
03:11:19,676 --> 03:11:20,057
[SPEAKER_16]: I agree.

1709
03:11:20,077 --> 03:11:21,037
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1710
03:11:21,977 --> 03:11:23,557
[SPEAKER_17]: I just wanted to get the temperature from the board.

1711
03:11:23,577 --> 03:11:28,859
[SPEAKER_17]: Normally we would still deliberate because we open up the public hearing, but I didn't think it was necessary.

1712
03:11:30,639 --> 03:11:38,261
[SPEAKER_17]: Allow the proponent to go before the ZBA and then come back before us and then we can save everyone's time there.

1713
03:11:39,293 --> 03:11:54,218
[SPEAKER_17]: So I will look for a motion to continue the actual address, 290 Salem Street, special permit and site plan review to March 6th, 2024.

1714
03:11:54,258 --> 03:12:01,160
[SPEAKER_09]: So moved.

1715
03:12:02,060 --> 03:12:03,320
[SPEAKER_17]: Second.

1716
03:12:06,801 --> 03:12:07,602
[SPEAKER_17]: Vice Chair Edelman.

1717
03:12:08,742 --> 03:12:08,822
[SPEAKER_17]: Aye.

1718
03:12:09,695 --> 03:12:10,336
[SPEAKER_17]: Peter Coutts.

1719
03:12:11,456 --> 03:12:11,576
[SPEAKER_12]: Aye.

1720
03:12:12,177 --> 03:12:12,857
[SPEAKER_17]: Ari Fishman.

1721
03:12:13,658 --> 03:12:13,798
[SPEAKER_17]: Aye.

1722
03:12:14,419 --> 03:12:15,339
[SPEAKER_17]: Pam Mariansky.

1723
03:12:15,880 --> 03:12:15,980
[SPEAKER_17]: Aye.

1724
03:12:16,620 --> 03:12:18,041
[SPEAKER_17]: And myself, Jackie McPherson.

1725
03:12:18,201 --> 03:12:18,622
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm an aye.

1726
03:12:19,162 --> 03:12:20,783
[SPEAKER_17]: We will see you on March 6th.

1727
03:12:20,964 --> 03:12:25,807
[SPEAKER_17]: And as Alicia has said, if you feel as though you can't make that date, please contact the city.

1728
03:12:27,368 --> 03:12:28,029
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.

1729
03:12:28,069 --> 03:12:29,470
[SPEAKER_10]: We appreciate your time and your input tonight.

1730
03:12:30,170 --> 03:12:30,691
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1731
03:12:31,271 --> 03:12:32,412
[SPEAKER_17]: Have a great evening.

1732
03:12:32,933 --> 03:12:33,133
[SPEAKER_18]: Thanks.

1733
03:12:43,442 --> 03:12:45,944
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not sure that I saw minutes.

1734
03:12:45,984 --> 03:12:47,425
[SPEAKER_17]: The next item are minutes.

1735
03:12:52,189 --> 03:12:55,252
[SPEAKER_17]: No, the draft minutes are there.

1736
03:12:55,272 --> 03:12:56,453
[SPEAKER_17]: No, there were no minutes.

1737
03:12:56,793 --> 03:13:01,998
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't fully complete those yet, but those should be ready next hearing.

1738
03:13:02,852 --> 03:13:04,613
[SPEAKER_17]: That's totally okay.

1739
03:13:05,153 --> 03:13:08,634
[SPEAKER_17]: I know that I didn't, I thought I was remiss in seeing them.

1740
03:13:09,194 --> 03:13:15,217
[SPEAKER_17]: And the next item is miscellaneous or anything like that, that the city or the board want to discuss.

1741
03:13:21,739 --> 03:13:25,281
[SPEAKER_17]: Hearing none, the next item is a motion to adjourn.

1742
03:13:27,281 --> 03:13:27,722
[SPEAKER_17]: So moved.

1743
03:13:29,022 --> 03:13:29,322
[SPEAKER_12]: Second.

1744
03:13:31,687 --> 03:13:33,508
