    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=92.033s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=93.534s">I</a>  offer this resolution tonight due to a meeting that I attended last Wednesday that was offered by the Medford Police Department, and it was their monthly community meeting they have the first Wednesday of the month. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=108.539s">Myself,</a>  Councilor Lungo-Koehn, and Councilor Caraviello were present at the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=113.26s">That</a>  particular meeting was of utmost importance because they were discussing <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=119.626s">the</a>  issue of the shooting that took place in South Bedford a few weeks prior to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=126.029s">And</a>  they, at the meeting, and I won't speak on behalf of the police department, let residents know that this is an ongoing and active investigation that's taking place and that they're putting all their resources into finding out exactly what happened and that a step up in patrol was going to happen also within that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=149.028s">as</a>  well as some recommendations that were offered by the chief about to increase lighting in certain areas in that particular vicinity, and also the fact that additional cameras within the police department would help to help solve some crime within our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=171.945s">But,</a>  Mr. President, I offer this resolution tonight because at the meeting, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=177.31s">One</a>  of the officers spoke up and directed his comments towards members of the city council, stating that it would be helpful, because other surrounding communities do it, if they could have what I would refer to as a revolving account that's within the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=195.164s">I</a>  mean, the account, in my opinion, could be within DPW. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=198.606s">It</a>  could be here at City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=200.048s">But</a>  to have a revolving account that <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=202.401s">Fines,</a>  when people are caught doing graffiti, fines of whatever is issued will go directly into the revolving account and can only be used for appropriation to remove graffiti within our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=220.154s">I</a>  also had the opportunity to look at some of the surrounding communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=224.644s">And</a>  I noticed that the city of Somerville has a program which they handle similarly with an account. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=234.391s">But</a>  they take it one step further on their website. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=237.733s">They</a>  also offer, which I'm going to add to my paper tonight, Mr. President, is that graffiti knows no age, no sex, no orientation, no, you know, people vandalize for whatever reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=254.016s">It</a>  was mentioned that it's done on private property. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=257.579s">As</a>  we know, it's done on public property. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=260.021s">As</a>  we experienced, it's done in parks. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=263.223s">And</a>  it's done throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=265.305s">And</a>  the fact that someone may tag a public building, it's easy to city contacts. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=270.449s">I</a>  know in the past, Mr. President, you work at the sheriff's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=274.392s">They've</a>  been gracious enough to come out with their itty graffiti machine and clean the graffiti. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=281.257s">But</a>  if it's done on private property, some communities have city ordinances that require homeowners to remove the graffiti within a certain amount of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=294.822s">And</a>  that adds insult to injury, in my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=297.943s">The</a>  fact that you're at home, someone tags the outside of your vinyl siding, and the next day you receive a call from the city saying <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=308.1s">You</a>  have 10 days to remove the graffiti. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=311.661s">You</a>  may not have the means to remove it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=314.902s">You</a>  may need to have the graffiti remain on your house for a period of time for insurance purposes and a whole issue of items. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=324.505s">And</a>  why I bring this up is the city of Somerville has a contract, and it's right on their website, and I have copies if anyone wants to see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=334.196s">And</a>  it's removal of graffiti agreement and release of liability. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=338.437s">And</a>  I won't read it, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=339.957s">It's</a>  a page long. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=341.778s">But</a>  it goes over the fact that if the city is willing to go onto private property and remove graffiti from the side of a home or a garage or wherever it may be, that the homeowner will hold the city free from liability, and they'll remove the graffiti at no expense to the homeowner. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=363.827s">And</a>  I thought that's a great idea, Mr. President, to eradicate graffiti in a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=371.434s">I</a>  know the city of Malden also, just recently in March, they introduced a new service that they provide to residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=384.664s">And</a>  they modeled it after the city of Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=387.987s">And</a>  it's modeled after the Citizens Connect smartphone application. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=392.895s">that</a>  the city of Boston currently uses. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=395.356s">And</a>  Malden just started this in March. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=398.056s">And</a>  they stated that, as an example, if a resident sees graffiti on the street, they would normally call or email the Department of Public Works. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=407.458s">Now</a>  a resident can simply take a picture using their smartphone. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=411.259s">With</a>  one click, the request is automatically sent to the department. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=415.4s">Once</a>  the graffiti is removed, the resident is notified on their smartphone. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=419.417s">that</a>  the issue has been resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=421.959s">They</a>  stated also in their press release, we are already seeing great results from the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=428.863s">Since</a>  its release, we have had 576 requests to the DPW. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=433.866s">Not</a>  all were graffiti. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=435.167s">These</a>  are just requests to DPW. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=438.389s">And</a>  543 were resolved with the balance slated for spring repairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=443.913s">That</a>  equates to 94% of all issues being resolved via the new application. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=449.281s">And</a>  most were fixed within 24 hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=452.343s">This</a>  is a great, great application. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=454.845s">It's</a>  a great way to connect residents of this community to City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=460.629s">And</a>  also, it goes on to say that they thanked, at the time, Mayor Menino and the city of Boston for their leadership on the initiative. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=470.796s">And</a>  also, which I found quite interesting, they thanked Governor Patrick and Lieutenant Governor Murray <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=477.682s">for</a>  offering funding for the applications so communities could take advantage of this technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=484.164s">So</a>  apparently there's grants or money out there that we can obtain as a community to not only have a revolving account, which is my request, but to also implement something similar to this Connect phone, smart phone. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=499.748s">I</a>  know Somerville uses, I think it's 311, Smart 311, I believe it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=509.248s">311</a>  to allow residents to contact the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=514.592s">They</a>  get a response back immediately saying that their request was accepted, the date and time. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=519.857s">And</a>  then, within a period of time, they're contacted by the city with updates. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=525.841s">It's</a>  just a great way of doing business. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=528.404s">And</a>  I would ask, Mr. President, that we not only have the administration look into setting up a revolving account <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=537.291s">exclusively</a>  for the purpose of graffiti removal in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=543.893s">We</a>  also look into this particular Citizens Connect smartphone application to allow residents the expanded means of communicating with the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=557.076s">Also,</a>  Mr. President, I received a number of e-mails because of this resolution, and one resident who asked if they can appear before the council <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=567.716s">Couldn't</a>  make it tonight, but will be before the council in the near future, is applying for a mural funding from the Medford Arts Council and also from the Senator Charles E. Shannon Community Safety Initiative. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=585.228s">And</a>  from what I understand, it's going to be very similar to the mural at the Medford Hillside. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=590.712s">And</a>  they're looking to put a mural. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=592.713s">I</a>  don't want to let the cat out of the bag, because this woman has done a lot of work on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=597.623s">But</a>  somewhere in South Bedford, they already received approval for a mural. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=602.025s">And</a>  this, in my opinion, will go a long way to covering up a wall that is typically, this particular wall that she's referring to, has been tagged a number of times. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=614.25s">And</a>  it will go a long way to beautifying the area and also making it less inviting for someone to come out and use that to tag Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=624.534s">So</a>  I would ask that the paper be amended. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=627.082s">to</a>  include the expansion and implementation of the Citizens Connect smartphone, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=635.165s">And</a>  I look forward to the mayor's response on this.</p>

    <p>[Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=641.707s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=642.567s">Councilor</a>  Knight, and then Councilor Dello Russo.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=646.029s">Thank</a>  you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=647.389s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knox, for bringing this resolution forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=650.154s">I</a>  think this is a great proactive approach to improving the quality of life for residents here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=655.677s">I</a>  will be voting in favor of this resolution and I might ask that the resolution be amended by way of a B paper, Mr. President, which would ask that the Medford police or the building department report back to this council locations that have been reported to have been graffitied within the last 12 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=670.025s">I</a>  think it's very important that we keep track of this data to determine whether or not there were clusters and trends that are occurring here in the city so that we know where to ramp up enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=677.233s">So</a>  I'd like to thank Councilor Marks for taking such a proactive approach to looking at the quality of life in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=682.416s">And</a>  I will be voting in favor of this resolution, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=684.878s">I</a>  just ask that it be amended for the Police Department of the powers that be to report back any locations that have been reported within the last calendar year.</p>

    <p>[Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=691.882s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=692.622s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo.</p>

    <p>[Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=695.724s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=697.685s">I</a>  want to also extend my thanks to Councilor Marks for bringing this matter up. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=702.548s">If</a>  my memory serves me correctly, I think it was President Emeritus Mayorko <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=707.294s">several</a>  years ago had suggested an ordinance to deal with graffiti, and I think it got tied down in committee, and one of the sticking points to it, if my memory serves me right, was that this would sometimes, in dealing with the graffiti, one of the things that you've addressed in this is that it can often place the victims of graffiti, the property owner, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=734.798s">also</a>  has the additional burden of finding a way to deal with this, get the graffiti cleaned up. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=741.903s">And</a>  for some people, whether they might own a home or a place of business, the cleanup of such an act is also a burden and may not be covered <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=753.368s">under</a>  their homeowners or business insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=757.13s">Um,</a>  so I, I'm glad that, uh, in your proposal, we have a remedy for that and, uh, you can count on my support as well.</p>

    <p>[Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=766.795s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=767.155s">Council</a>  vice-president Caraviello and then councilor Lungo. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=770.016s">Kern.</a> </p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=770.516s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=771.417s">Um,</a>  I want to commend, uh, my council Marks on, uh, on his motion here. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=776.519s">Um,</a>  I'd like to see that the city look into possibly buying a machine. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=780.941s">Uh,</a>  I mean, all they are is a, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=783.863s">And</a>  if there are grants available, why can't we buy our own machine so we don't have to keep going and looking for one? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=791.165s">And</a>  also, Mr. President, I'd like to send a letter to the mayor asking him to ask the sheriff if he could come down with the graffiti team and maybe clean up some of the stuff that's down here now. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=805.229s">I</a>  don't know if that's already been asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=808.53s">Because</a>  as I say, there is, like on Harvard Street, I know the T's already cleaned it a couple of times. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=812.512s">And</a>  if you get on Forest Street, there's a couple of, there's the big old building, it's been tagged. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=819.876s">It</a>  is an eyesore. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=822.638s">There's</a>  been some tagging on the side of that sound wall. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=827.4s">As</a>  I say, if the Sheriff's Department could come down and help us out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=829.902s">But</a>  again, if there is some grant money, why can't we buy our own power washer, high end power washer to do that ourselves rather than hiring a company to do it?</p>

    <p>[Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=838.902s">Thank</a>  you, Vice President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=840.422s">On</a>  the main motion, amended by Councilor Marks, Councilor Knight, and Vice President Caraviello, Councilor Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=847.144s">Thank</a>  you, President Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=848.445s">I</a>  want to thank Councilor Marks for putting this on. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=851.306s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello, Marks, and I were at that meeting, the police meeting, community meeting, and we spoke an hour, you know, we got updates on the South Medford shooting, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=863.103s">The</a>  next most spoken about subject was the graffiti and how it's an eyesore, how Somerville is getting tough on their graffiti. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=871.89s">So</a>  it's bringing more down, especially in the South Medford area. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=875.453s">But</a>  there's people also complaining about it in West Medford, in Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=880.797s">It</a>  is everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=881.578s">I</a>  mean, people are tagging for fun. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=883.539s">People</a>  are tagging to break the rules, break the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=887.543s">And</a>  I think if Somerville's getting tough on it, I think it's time Medford does too. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=893.322s">put</a>  on the agenda and try to get certain spots cleaned up, but I think an ordinance creating a revolving account is a great way to do it, so I thank Councilor Marks for putting this on. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=907.012s">I</a>  definitely am in favour of the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=908.993s">I</a>  think we need to stop the repeat tagging and just the fact that it's everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=916.719s">I</a>  think we should spend a portion of the money that comes into the revolving account, not only to clean up the <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=923.561s">like</a>  we spoke about last week, on cameras so that we can catch these offenders. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=928.442s">We</a>  can catch them, we can find them, and we can make that revolving account, clean up all the graffiti within our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=935.164s">So</a>  I would hope that some of that money would go to be spent on cameras. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=939.826s">I</a>  also wanted to just, Councilman Marks brought up Citizen Connect smartphone, and I know it goes along with the 311 system that Somerville uses. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=950.329s">I</a>  happen to be in Somerville today, and they are giving out magnets. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=954.295s">with</a>  regards to if it's not an emergency and you need us or any other city service, you call 311. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=960.058s">I</a>  brought this up maybe four or five months ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=963.759s">We</a>  voted 7-0 to get this installed in Medford, this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=969.542s">It</a>  will provide accountability and it's something that our residents deserve because I'm sure we're all sick of saying, hearing, when is my sidewalk gonna get fixed? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=979.427s">When</a>  is my street pothole gonna be repaved? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=982.327s">all</a>  the DPW, you know, they'll say it's going to be done, or you're on the list, especially with sidewalk repairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=989.651s">You're</a>  on the list, you're on the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=991.392s">We</a>  really don't know what happens with that list. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=993.793s">This</a>  is a way for accountability, for response, and for action. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=998.075s">So</a>  again, I'm going to see if I can amend your paper Councilor Marks and again vote that City of Medford implement the 311 program. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1006.36s">I</a>  think it's <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1007.856s">an</a>  absolute great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1009.616s">I've</a>  spoken to people in the building department at the city of Somerville, and they don't know what they would do without it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1016.278s">So</a>  I think it's time for Medford to become accountable for all the complaints that come in, issues and concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1023.479s">So</a>  thank you again, Councilor Marks, and I'd like to amend the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1027.12s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1027.74s">Chair</a>  recognizes Vice President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1029.901s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1030.741s">I</a>  just want to say one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1033.401s">At</a>  the meeting, the chief talked about see something, say something. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1037.438s">I</a>  mean, you know, some of these tags, I mean, they're not like one minute tags. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1041.72s">I</a>  mean, if you're going to Harvest Street, that had to take a half an hour to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1045.162s">Someone</a>  had to be driving by and seeing this and not say something. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1047.944s">I</a>  mean, on Forest Street, they climbed up to the third floor of the back of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1052.346s">I</a>  mean, so I mean, it isn't that, you know, you're spraying something and you're running away. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1056.248s">I</a>  mean, if someone had to see things during this time, again, if you see something, say something, call the police so they can get caught in the act.</p>

    <p>[Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1065.825s">On</a>  the motion amended by Vice President Caraviello, Councilor Marks, Councilor Lungo-Koehn and Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1072.068s">All</a>  those in favour? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1073.729s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1074.429s">The</a>  roll call has been requested by Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1077.85s">The</a>  clerk will call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1081.572s">Vice</a>  President Caraviello? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1083.413s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1084.353s">Councilor</a>  De La Russa? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1085.174s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1085.994s">Councilor</a>  Knight? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1086.534s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1087.274s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1087.955s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1088.775s">Councilor</a>  Marks? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1089.535s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1090.116s">Councilor</a>  Panta? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1090.636s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1092.441s">Yes,</a>  by a vote of seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes as amended. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1097.882s">Item</a>  14-686, offered by Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1101.903s">Be</a>  it resolved that a comparison of public safety issues compared to the mayor's pay to park proposal be discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1108.464s">Councilor</a>  Penta.</p>

    <p>[Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1109.584s">Mr.</a>  President, I think in part we all know that around 5 o'clock or 5.30 this evening, I think we received the mayor's press release. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1120.506s">that</a>  he'd signed the contract with Republic from Tennessee. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1123.708s">But</a>  I'll get to that later on. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1125.17s">It's</a>  still part of the comparison. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1127.672s">You</a>  know, when we came on board at the beginning of the year, we were asked to give what our priorities were. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1131.515s">And</a>  I believe the police department and police station was our number one priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1136.018s">And</a>  unfortunately, it hasn't found itself anywhere in any of the mayor's agendas. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1141.803s">Now,</a>  the police station would derive an extreme benefit for our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1147.027s">It</a>  would make us go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1149.571s">not</a>  only socially, but as a community going forward with tomorrow's technology, and it would also give a presence of community policing. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1160.516s">And</a>  that's something I think a lot of the people asking for, more police officers, more patrolmen, more visibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1167.699s">And</a>  if you give them a better place to work out of, then I think that would go a long way. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1174.341s">You</a>  know, we paid in excess, I think, of $78,000 <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1178.979s">when</a>  we received the feasibility study from the police department and the fire department on May 5th of this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1185.881s">And</a>  unfortunately for the police department, they didn't get anything out of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1189.182s">Fire</a>  department did, but the police department didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1192.864s">And</a>  once again, I don't know, maybe it's just the mayor, he doesn't have it on his radar screen, but public safety, I believe is the first of priorities here of any of all the councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1204.168s">Some</a>  of the things that Mr. Mayor, that would be beneficial, not only for our community, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1209.378s">is</a>  the council has supported, in each and every calendar budget, the recycling of two new cruises each and every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1218.363s">And</a>  that would go a long way, once again, to add to the police officers on duty, driving their cruises, letting them know that the city is thinking about them, and they don't have to drive in a car that has about 140,000 miles on it, and they don't know if it's gonna make it or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1233.892s">I</a>  think it was Councilor Marks, three years ago, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1238.24s">came</a>  up with the idea of why can't we have a special truck enforcement unit? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1241.321s">It's</a>  a great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1243.522s">What's</a>  wrong with training one or two people to be involved with truck enforcement for that particular purpose? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1249.584s">Because</a>  I think we can go down any one of these streets in any one of these days, and we see the amount of trucks that travel down High Street, Main Street, or the major streets here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1258.407s">That</a>  would go a long way. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1260.588s">In</a>  our public safety issue regarding lighting, all the squares are just dimly lit. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1266.069s">And</a>  that in and of itself is an invitation <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1268.356s">for</a>  some type of crime, whatever the crime might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1271.358s">You</a>  get Route 16, the parking lot behind St. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1274.16s">Joe's.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1274.981s">This</a>  will probably be the 14th time that we've discussed this, and still no lighting. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1280.045s">We've</a>  had situations there where a lady called up and she was afraid to get into a car because of people there, and also in a separate situation where a drug transaction was reported. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1289.572s">Also</a>  right here in Medford Square, the Route 16 overpass, underpass on Route 93, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1294.71s">has</a>  no lights. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1296.091s">Riverside</a>  Avenue, go underneath the overpass there, still no lights. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1300.812s">We</a>  have asked for the issue of public safety, timely street swiping. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1305.514s">We've</a>  also asked for our crosswalk painting. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1308.095s">You're</a>  lucky if you see that once a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1310.856s">These</a>  aren't huge cost items. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1312.756s">These</a>  are items that are readily available within our budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1316.538s">Now</a>  we've talked about police cameras and high visibility locations. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1321.151s">Were</a>  it not for the business merchant that owned a store on the corner of George and Winthrop Street a few years, a couple of years back, how they caught the guy that assaulted the young lady from Tufts University. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1333.255s">And</a>  as a result of that, Mr. President, we all know that the cameras are beneficial. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1338.22s">We</a>  have $8,893 in our linkage account for where they could buy a few cameras. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1343.764s">But</a>  if you really want to get into it, we have $6,400,000 in our free cash account. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1348.967s">So</a>  I don't think there should be any reason why we can't go out there and buy any cameras. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1354.371s">A</a>  bonus to our people that work. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1357.433s">We</a>  can review the one day a week and swap day reward. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1361.095s">And</a>  that would be for those officers with a perfect attendance for six months. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1365.238s">Something</a>  different, something creative for the police officers. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1368.706s">rather</a>  than the annual, it's on a six month basis, and that might work out, it's a tryout, it's something to think about. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1376.55s">I</a>  think we should also think about revisiting the idea of having retired police personnel be part of the parking enforcement proposal here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1384.815s">Because</a>  that in and of itself, that in and of itself would bring a big luxury, not only to the people here in this community, but I think to the business people who would have a better idea of knowing <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1397.748s">when</a>  and how to tag certain folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1400.089s">Because</a>  we really don't know what this out-of-state company from Tennessee is going to be like. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1404.952s">They</a>  could just be, I don't know, they're going to start at 7 o'clock in the morning to 7 at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1408.674s">It</a>  doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1410.115s">Boston</a>  doesn't even start till 8 o'clock in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1413.217s">We</a>  have a civil defense system that needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1416.418s">Since</a>  Mr. Mangone has passed on as its civil defense director, I don't know where it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1422.242s">Is</a>  it in limbo? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1423.122s">Is</a>  it going to be used? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1424.503s">If</a>  not, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1425.657s">We've</a>  talked about a snow emergency system, and we haven't heard anything back on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1429.099s">And</a>  I think we're all aware of the fact that a snow emergency system of some type needs to be in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1436.545s">And</a>  taking some of these issues and putting them on the left, then I go to the right, and I look at this idea of this new proposal that, if you agree or disagree, the mayor signed into effect apparently today regarding this Tennessee firm Republic. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1455.834s">regarding</a>  a traffic enforcement program that's going to be six days a week from 7 in the morning to 7 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1462.839s">at</a>  night. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1463.619s">There'll</a>  be no free parking on the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1465.921s">According</a>  to the mayor's commentary, there's going to be two 30-minute parking spots in each one of the squares, and there'll be four paid single-space meter spots in each of the four square districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1481.652s">Other</a>  than that, there'll be kiosks allotted. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1485.652s">It's</a>  kind of like interesting because if you look at the commentary made by the director from the Medford Chamber of Commerce, Mr. White, he indicated that he was hoping that he would have an opportunity with its members to sit down and discuss this. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1500.196s">And</a>  he also made reference to the fact that each and every one of the squares have unique positions, unique concerns as it relates to businesses and how they might be affected. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1509.459s">How</a>  the mayor came up to this resolution and signing, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1513.459s">But</a>  it's kind of like unfair because we were in that meeting on September 10th, and we were told that he would get back to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1520.742s">We</a>  were told that there'd be a public meeting for which this council voted seven to nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1524.724s">He</a>  never honored that. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1526.345s">We</a>  were told also that the concerns that would be brought up would be addressed and to have an idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1531.767s">I</a>  don't know, and we don't really know what part of the business community, what businesses are going to be exempt from not having a meter or a kiosk anywhere in that particular area. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1543.066s">You</a>  take these two things and you ask yourself, the Medford Police Department and public safety is such a huge issue here in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1550.709s">And</a>  some of the samples that I just talked about still have yet to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1554.971s">But</a>  the mayor thinks it's more important to go forward with a parking enforcement program, strike that, a paid to park program with enforcement that's only going to bring in $300,000 the first year and $700,000 from the second to the ninth year, it's the 10th year. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1572.406s">May</a>  sound like a lot of money, but my feeling personally would have been, had the city decided to go forward after that meeting on the 10th, having an opportunity to listen to the folks within our community, listen to the business in the community, all four areas of this community, rather than have one size fits all, which includes Medford Square, in the press release as outlined tonight at 510, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1599.947s">I</a>  just don't think it serves in the best interest of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1603.148s">I</a>  don't think it helps our police department, and I don't think it gives the community in and of itself a fair shot as it relates to priorities that need to be addressed rather than another money enhancement for the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1617.853s">Mr.</a>  President, today, as you know, I'm assuming all of you know that the mayor signed this contract tonight around 517 or thereabouts. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1628.397s">He</a>  signed the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1629.758s">And</a>  he makes a notation that the council was in support of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1634.7s">What</a>  the council was in support of was that on May 20th, when we had that meeting, we had agreed to the three vendors that came in, one would be selected, which was Republic from Tennessee. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1645.264s">But</a>  we agreed to that somebody would come back after he had negotiations and we would discuss it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1651.107s">And</a>  we did on September 10th. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1652.988s">But</a>  when the pushback came back, the mayor decided not to go forward at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1657.709s">And</a>  speaking to Mr. Skelton, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1659.443s">are</a>  referring to Mr. Skelton's comments from Republic. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1662.726s">From</a>  the 10th to the 25th of September, there was absolutely no communication between the mayor and Republic. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1669.411s">So</a>  something had to take place from the 24th to today, the 7th. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1673.915s">And</a>  taking that into consideration, it's quite obvious that the chamber's concerns, oh, I don't know who wrote the letter because we don't have a copy of the letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1681.081s">He</a>  says he got a letter from the chamber. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1682.963s">But</a>  when you have four separate squares, including Medford Square, which makes five, and their issues are all unique, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1688.854s">and</a>  they needed to be heard, and they weren't heard, and the mayor decides to have one size fits all, I don't think that's what you call a happy resolution, especially to the business people and to the taxpayers of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1700.818s">You</a>  know, the fact of the matter is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1705.679s">We're</a>  getting rid of people who don't live in the community, who were parking at spots all day long, and they haven't been tagged. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1713.322s">And</a>  this has been going on for the entire years of the administration of this city, this mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1718.666s">And</a>  now what we're going to be doing is tagging, if not towing, and telling our own taxpayers in this community, you people are going to have to start paying. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1728.072s">Now,</a>  right up front, no free parking unless you are lucky enough to get one of those two spots in any one of the four or five sections of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1737.278s">Where</a>  it's going, I don't know, Mr. President, but all I can tell you is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1741.381s">If</a>  I had to put my money on something, I would put it on public safety, the police department, the personnel that's needed to keep this community safe, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1749.039s">And</a>  more importantly, the subject matters that I brought up under the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1752.92s">Those</a>  to me are pressing needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1755.661s">They</a>  have no comparison, no comparison at all to a parking paid to park program or enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1763.163s">If</a>  the mayor was so concerned about that paid to park program and enforcement, he should have done it years ago, but he didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1768.884s">And</a>  when they knew that people from Winchester and other communities were coming here and parking all day and not getting tagged and ticketed, he should have done something, but he didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1777.607s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1778.148s">put</a>  $300,000 this first year out of the box, compare everything to what the police department needs to keep our community safe and protected. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1786.535s">It's</a>  pale in comparison. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1788.436s">And</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, I just wanted to say that, um, I just think, you know, this council is either going to be committed to public safety and a new PlayStation and the police department, or this is nothing more than hot air every Tuesday night when we come here to talk about public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1804.54s">We</a>  have more than enough examples. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1806.622s">And</a>  I think we have more than enough good police officers. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1810.865s">The</a>  shooting is just a drop in the bucket compared to all the drug problems that are existing throughout this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1816.609s">And</a>  that's a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1818.07s">And</a>  if they had more personnel, and if they could go to court, and if they had more of the mechanisms and the technology that is needed, it would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1828.597s">You</a>  know, when you talk to someone, you say, hey, you're building a brand new public works department, $14 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1835.258s">$14</a>  million. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1835.858s">Still</a>  don't even have enough men to man it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1839.159s">But</a>  you have a police department that's ready to fall apart. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1841.539s">You</a>  have an evidence room that's completely out of control and a whole host of other issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1847.641s">So,</a>  I would say, Mr. President and my fellow colleagues, that I think it's time that we take the stand and we tell the mayor we want a new police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1856.362s">I</a>  don't care how you fund it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1857.863s">You</a>  found the money for a public works department, then find the money for a police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1861.883s">Because</a>  you're not going to make one seem to be more important than another. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1865.046s">And</a>  at the same time, you're not going to put the lives of this community and the folks in this community at risk.</p>

    <p>[Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1873.148s">Vice</a>  President Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1874.808s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1876.868s">I</a>  echo some of Councilor Penta's concerns here. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1880.409s">Last</a>  week, after the meeting, the next day on Councilor Longo's motion on the cameras, I received a call from a gentleman from Medford, who that's what they do, about cameras. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1891.211s">And</a>  he'd be willing to come down to meet with the chief <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1894.565s">He</a>  said the cost of the camera is approximately $5,000 per camera. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1899.486s">And</a>  this company does multiple cities and towns police forces. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1904.367s">So</a>  I told the chief I would refer the number over to him. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1909.468s">At</a>  the meeting that we were at at the police station, I did ask the chief about using retired policemen to man details and do other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1917.289s">And</a>  the chief was steadfast against that. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1921.03s">He</a>  said he had safety concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1923.206s">liability</a>  concerns about using recently retired policemen. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1926.808s">And</a>  my point was, many details go unmet because you can't find anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1934.392s">Why</a>  couldn't you use somebody that's recently retired to come on? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1936.894s">But</a>  he didn't want to hear it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1941.556s">One</a>  last thing, talking about the parking, one of the things I would like to see in here was maybe some type of a one-ticket amnesty program for people who <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1952.074s">just</a>  made a mistake or whatever, for whatever reason, for maybe the first 30 days to maybe help out. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1961.037s">And</a>  I'm going to reiterate again what I said on our first meeting in the parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1965.018s">If</a>  this is going to generate $18 to $20 million, I'd like to see all the money generated go toward the police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1971.401s">I</a>  mean, if we're going to go out and bond for that, let that $18 million pay for the bonds. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1979.264s">rather</a>  than put it into the general fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1983.386s">I</a>  mean, if the numbers that they give are correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1988.468s">So</a>  I don't know what my other Councilors think about that motion.</p>

    <p>[Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1994.851s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1997.752s">Is</a>  there a motion?</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1998.332s">Mr.</a>  President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1999.813s">Councilor</a>  Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2003.515s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2007.645s">just</a>  read over the email that we all received, too, regarding the mayor signing the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2015.171s">And,</a>  you know, I find it ironic, Mr. President, that in the mayor's opening statement, he said the city's goal is to provide the best possible parking experience for its citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2029.201s">And</a>  you would think, Mr. President, over the last several years that this would have been a goal of the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2036.506s">There</a>  was a spotlight, I believe it was done by Channel 5 about six months ago regarding the lack of enforcement for resident permit parking in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2047.072s">It</a>  didn't exist at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2049.274s">So</a>  at that point, the mayor wasn't trying to provide the best experience for citizens in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2056.458s">He</a>  also said in his statement that the objectives of this program are to deter illegal parking, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2064.192s">to</a>  ensure timely turnover of parking spaces, to benefit and enhance the business districts, and to create a friendly environment for consumers. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2073.658s">Mr.</a>  President, what was asked for back in 2009 was to enforce existing signage. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2084.185s">That</a>  was the recommendation back in 2009, to enforce existing signage and be consistent <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2092.52s">which</a>  never took place in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2095.16s">So</a>  if we had consistent enforcement throughout the community, there would be no need to hire an outside company from Tennessee to outsource it to Tennessee. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2107.343s">We</a>  all know the contract is based on performance. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2111.923s">And</a>  that will result, not could, it will result in very aggressive ticketing in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2121.761s">it</a>  will result in aggressive ticketing in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2126.505s">So</a>  if the mayor was really intent on putting the best possible parking experience for citizens, all along, he would have provided consistent enforcement by our own in-house personnel to move these cars along. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2144.278s">I</a>  agree with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2146.399s">However,</a>  I don't agree with hiring an outside company, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2152.183s">It</a>  also goes along to state that one of the benefits of this particular program, and I'll quote it, it says, the chamber also acknowledged that there are several beneficial aspects of the plan, such as the user-friendly kiosk. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2172.091s">I've</a>  been talking to residents, I've been talking to business owners throughout the community, it's a hot topic, and I haven't heard one resident so far say, you know what, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2181.397s">I</a>  don't mind getting out of my car in West Method, walking four or five car lengths, which may even be a little further because there's hydrants and there's bus stops and everything else within this community crosswalks, putting my plate in the kiosk, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2201.291s">putting</a>  my time in the kiosk, putting my money in the kiosk, and going in the West Method Spa and getting a newspaper and going back to my car. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2210.438s">I</a>  haven't heard one resident say that they feel that's a benefit, that they feel that that's a good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2217.816s">Mr.</a>  President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2218.556s">So,</a>  I'm not quite sold on the use of kiosk on the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2223.697s">I</a>  don't know any other community in this surrounding area that use kiosk on the streets, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2230.039s">I</a>  don't believe it's user-friendly. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2231.879s">And</a>  I believe, as was mentioned at our meeting a couple of weeks ago, that if you happen to be stopping in one of our business districts and you happen to have your kids with you, or you happen to be taking your elderly mother to a doctor's appointment, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2246.967s">It's</a>  not user-friendly to walk several spots to put money in a kiosk, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2253.35s">It</a>  was also mentioned that the mayor was willing to settle or compromise with the business community in giving free spots throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2266.976s">And</a>  that was very admirable of the mayor, but let's break it down for a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2273.834s">This</a>  plan calls for 1,000 parking spots, roughly 1,000 parking spots. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2280.376s">The</a>  mayor, under his new proposal that he just signed, is allotting two parking spots for 30-minute free parking in five of the business districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2291.0s">So</a>  that's 10 spots. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2292.661s">That's</a>  1% of the total parking spots. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2297.243s">So</a>  this great, grandioso plan that the mayor came down and <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2301.297s">decided</a>  with the business owners who were all advocating for some sort of free parking, albeit limited free parking, but some sort of free parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2311.427s">Now,</a>  the mayor was gracious enough to give us 10 spots citywide. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2318.493s">So</a>  if you happen to be in Method Square, there may be a spot down by the CVS, down by Carlene's. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2326.966s">And</a>  there may be a spot on the east side, all the way down by City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2333.01s">Those</a>  are your two spots for free parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2336.933s">Doesn't</a>  seem like a lot to me, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2340.215s">And</a>  I don't think it's what the business owners intended on. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2345.778s">Secondly,</a>  Mr. President, this council asked several times, and recently a couple of weeks ago, to hold a public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2355.916s">to</a>  allow residents, business owners, anyone interested to come up and address the council, address the mayor, address the administration, address this company from Tennessee, and the mayor refused to hold a public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2370.104s">He</a>  kept on going back saying, don't forget, there was a public hearing in September 2009. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2375.167s">Mr.</a>  Mayor, that was five years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2381.926s">Things</a>  change in five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2383.807s">There</a>  are new residents in this community over the past five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2387.269s">There</a>  are new business owners in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2389.65s">There</a>  are new challenges facing our residents and our business owners. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2394.152s">And</a>  to go based on a hearing that took place five years ago, the mayor must have his head stuck in the sand. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2403.637s">So</a>  there was no input from this council, and I speak for myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2409.309s">And</a>  I'd like to know if any member of this council was able to effectively make change in the mayor's proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2416.385s">I'd</a>  like to hear it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2418.151s">Because</a>  every time I offered something, the mayor just poo-pooed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2422.796s">Oh,</a>  that can't be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2423.716s">We</a>  can't do it like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2425.238s">This</a>  was the mayor's proposal from the start. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2428.941s">No</a>  one had any input, the business owners, nor the residents of this community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2435.308s">I</a>  know the mayor, in his statement, keeps on going back, saying the business owners and the chamber are on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2441.093s">What</a>  about the 56,000 residents of this community? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2445.735s">What</a>  input do they have? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2447.436s">They're</a>  the ones that traverse the businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2449.997s">They're</a>  the ones that go to the schools and the churches and the medical appointments in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2456.579s">Why</a>  do they have no input, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2460.321s">You</a>  know, I don't know why the mayor decided to craft this program in a vacuum. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2470.165s">He</a>  crafted it, as he stated three weeks ago, with members of his departments. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2476.569s">That</a>  who has ultimately made the final decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2480.312s">Members</a>  of his department heads made the decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2485.495s">And</a>  then once the program went out for RFP, request for proposal, and came back, the mayor was about to sign it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2493.54s">And</a>  he thought better of it and said, let me have the council do a committee of the whole meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2499.056s">where</a>  business owners came down, the ones that did know about it came down, and they offered many suggestions. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2507.362s">And</a>  I talked to a business owner tonight that was at that meeting, not gonna state his name, and he wasn't aware of the mayor just signing this, but I asked him, is that acceptable, two spots? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2519.051s">And</a>  he said, absolutely not. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2521.754s">And</a>  he thought he was gonna have some input. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2524.977s">And</a>  he had no input at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2526.598s">So</a>  I don't know who the mayor met with, as Councilor Penta mentioned, but this was a decision made strictly by the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2536.166s">If</a>  the mayor was so concerned about providing such an experience for parkers in this community, why did he let resident permit parking go for so many years without enforcement? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2549.537s">But</a>  he collected the fee for the permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2552.74s">He</a>  didn't let that go, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2554.619s">He</a>  made sure he collected the fee, but he didn't provide the enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2558.522s">The</a>  mayor allowed people to park from Winchester and Arlington and West Bedford for years and take the commuter rail in, and take the buses in. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2568.128s">He</a>  allowed them to park in Bedford Square and Haines Square for years, Mr. President, without enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2575.273s">So,</a>  you know, I'm not sold on this program, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2579.396s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello just mentioned the fact that <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2583.497s">retired</a>  police officers possibly doing the role in-house. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2588.038s">I</a>  offered back some years ago, Mr. President, to look at having crossing guards who I spoke to the union president, said they would be more than happy to do that task. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2600.681s">They</a>  already have uniforms. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2602.741s">Many</a>  of them are already trained. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2604.742s">And</a>  at the time, it just fell on deaf ears to take this in-house. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2612.711s">The</a>  mayor went off, signed it, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2614.712s">I</a>  wish him well on this, but I wish there were more public hearings. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2620.355s">I</a>  wish that there was more input from the community and from business owners in this community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2626.799s">And</a>  I wish we had some time. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2627.98s">We</a>  waited this many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2630.241s">I</a>  wish we had some time to really sit behind the table like we did a few weeks ago and really iron out some of the differences. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2638.766s">And</a>  we really didn't have that opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2641.525s">And</a>  I think the mayor fell short of the mark on this proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2645.647s">And</a>  it's going to come back. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2647.909s">At</a>  some point, when the aggressive enforcement starts, it's going to come back. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2652.792s">And</a>  the mayor is going to do everything he can to hide behind the issue, like he did in this letter, stating, if you read half the letter, half it's about the council votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2665.199s">What</a>  member behind this reel voted on the proposal? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2668.493s">We</a>  voted to allow the mayor to enter into a 10-year contract because of state statute. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2675.796s">My</a>  vote wasn't predicated on what was involved within that proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2681.294s">My</a>  vote was to allow them because all three bids came back for 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2685.835s">So</a>  at the time, the mayor presented it to us saying, I can't negotiate at all because I don't have the authority to go and negotiate anything over three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2694.658s">You</a>  have to give me the ability to negotiate. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2697.259s">And</a>  that's what this council did. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2699.56s">We</a>  never voted on the terms of the agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2703.021s">Not</a>  one time did we ever vote on the terms of the agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2709.003s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2711.653s">Mr.</a>  President, um, I guess I missed this when I was reading it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2715.895s">If</a>  you read the bottom of the mass comment, it says the chamber also acknowledged that there were several beneficial respects to the plan, such as user friendly kiosks, whatever that means. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2727.499s">After</a>  deliberating and discussing concerns raised by the business community, the mayor is recommending the following changes to the plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2735.962s">He's</a>  recommending, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2738.8s">This</a>  isn't a finality. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2741.641s">If</a>  you go to point number three, it says recommend $250,000 of the revenue generated on an annual basis to be dedicated to the business district improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2751.584s">It's</a>  a recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2752.965s">This</a>  isn't a done deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2754.225s">And</a>  if you have $250,000, what district gets it first? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2757.506s">North</a>  Medford, South Medford, Boston Ave, Medford Square? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2761.447s">Where's</a>  the determination there? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2762.968s">And</a>  then the last one, retain business and commuter permits. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2765.609s">What</a>  does that mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2767.446s">All</a>  subjective commentary. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2770.148s">I</a>  don't even know if this is really the done deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2773.031s">All</a>  he's doing, he's saying he signed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2775.292s">And</a>  I'm wondering if these are still things to be negotiated. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2779.536s">He's</a>  recommending. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2781.057s">These</a>  are recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2783.759s">They</a>  may be just sticking to the original part of the plan and getting back to what Councilor Marks alluded to. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2789.324s">Not</a>  only is it going to be aggressive enforcement, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2793.302s">But</a>  why would you start at 7 o'clock in the morning? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2796.083s">Boston,</a>  which is much bigger than Medford, starts at 8. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2800.203s">Brookline,</a>  when they had their kiosks, they had to take them away because they were hurting the businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2806.344s">And</a>  then if they're even recognizing by putting meters, single meters, in certain parts, well, maybe they should think about just putting meters, period, and see how that goes, and have local people do the enforcement part. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2820.094s">But</a>  the more I keep reading this thing, words stand off a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2823.136s">It's</a>  the terminology that's used. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2824.917s">He's</a>  recommending. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2826.037s">So</a>  I don't even know if this is a done deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2827.758s">None</a>  of us know. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2830.48s">It's</a>  two 30-minute free parking spaces in West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2835.243s">Well,</a>  who's in West Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2836.063s">Who's</a>  it going to be? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2836.763s">Has</a>  that been determined yet? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2837.684s">They're</a>  going to flip a coin? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2840.085s">Go</a>  to Boston Avenue, you're going to flip a coin? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2842.587s">The</a>  whole length of that street, two free parking spaces? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2846.049s">And</a>  then four paid single-space meter spots. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2850.427s">in</a>  each of the above listed districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2853.969s">Who's</a>  going to get those four? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2855.791s">And</a>  as I said before, what businesses are going to be excluded rather than included? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2861.995s">You</a>  know, the law is very specific on this, and I said it to you last week, and I'll say it to you again, and I said it to our chief procurement officer. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2869.72s">The</a>  responsibility of bringing the contract forward was from the chief procurement officer, not from the mayor, and not from the budget director. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2878.205s">That's</a>  what the law says. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2879.71s">And</a>  there needed to be a recommendation in writing with a comparison of doing it in-house as compared to doing it out-house. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2887.393s">And</a>  in this situation, we never got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2889.733s">We</a>  never got the recommendation and how that recommendation was determined so as for the council to make a legitimate vote to go forward to accept it or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2900.137s">So</a>  there's a whole host of issues that surround not only the mayor signing this or even getting to the point to having him sign it, but the fact that he lied <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2909.696s">He</a>  lied to we, the people, by not coming and having the public forum for which seven members of this council voted on, to at least have a public forum, to at least have the business community, and at least have the taxpayers, the residents of the community, to come and speak up about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2924.399s">I</a>  think we're all getting our emails, and people are just, once again, hearing about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2928.44s">Some</a>  of them, not that they're for it, not some of them against it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2931.4s">They</a>  want to know more about it and how it's going to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2934.021s">But</a>  apparently, the mayor doesn't want us to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2936.707s">It's</a>  quite obvious. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2937.508s">He</a>  certainly doesn't want the taxpayers and the residents to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2940.449s">And</a>  however he chose what businesses that he met with, who knows what businesses they were that convinced him to go forward with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2947.554s">It's</a>  a damn shame, because I don't think this serves in the best interest of our community.</p>
