1
00:00:01,172 --> 00:00:04,094
[SPEAKER_11]: The 29th regular meeting of the Medford City Council will be called to order.

2
00:00:04,114 --> 00:00:05,094
[SPEAKER_11]: The clerk will call the roll.

[SPEAKER_12]: Vice President Caraviello?

4
00:00:06,655 --> 00:00:06,916
[SPEAKER_12]: Present.

5
00:00:07,996 --> 00:00:08,977
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Dello Russo?

6
00:00:08,997 --> 00:00:09,777
[SPEAKER_12]: Present.

7
00:00:09,797 --> 00:00:10,318
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Knight?

8
00:00:10,458 --> 00:00:11,338
[SPEAKER_12]: Present.

9
00:00:11,358 --> 00:00:11,999
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor McCurran?

10
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:12,699
[SPEAKER_00]: Present.

11
00:00:17,942 --> 00:00:18,143
[SPEAKER_11]: Present.

12
00:00:19,143 --> 00:00:19,804
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Penta?

13
00:00:20,304 --> 00:00:20,484
[SPEAKER_12]: Present.

14
00:00:21,505 --> 00:00:22,245
[SPEAKER_12]: President Camuso?

15
00:00:22,805 --> 00:00:23,146
[SPEAKER_11]: Present.

16
00:00:23,226 --> 00:00:24,987
[SPEAKER_11]: Seven members present, zero absent.

17
00:00:25,227 --> 00:00:26,668
[SPEAKER_11]: Please rise to salute our flag.

18
00:00:44,167 --> 00:00:51,930
[SPEAKER_11]: Item number, we're having technical difficulties again this evening with the microphone, so please just bear with us.

19
00:00:54,251 --> 00:00:56,172
[SPEAKER_11]: The chair recognizes Councilor Dello Russo.

20
00:00:58,353 --> 00:00:58,793
[SPEAKER_11]: Suspension.

21
00:01:02,698 --> 00:01:16,464
[SPEAKER_11]: 14-685 offered by Councilor Marks, whereas graffiti is a significant public nuisance that leads to blight and criminal activity contributing to a decrease in property values and overall quality of life.

22
00:01:17,585 --> 00:01:28,489
[SPEAKER_11]: Then be it resolved that a graffiti vandalism revolving account be established within the Medford Police Department to provide for graffiti removal on public and private properties.

23
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:30,050
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Marks.

24
00:01:32,033 --> 00:01:33,093
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

25
00:01:33,534 --> 00:01:47,758
[SPEAKER_06]: I offer this resolution tonight due to a meeting that I attended last Wednesday that was offered by the Medford Police Department, and it was their monthly community meeting they have the first Wednesday of the month.

26
00:01:48,539 --> 00:01:52,520
[SPEAKER_06]: Myself, Councilor Lungo-Koehn, and Councilor Caraviello were present at the meeting.

27
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:58,642
[SPEAKER_06]: That particular meeting was of utmost importance because they were discussing

28
00:01:59,626 --> 00:02:05,289
[SPEAKER_06]: the issue of the shooting that took place in South Bedford a few weeks prior to that.

29
00:02:06,029 --> 00:02:28,580
[SPEAKER_06]: And they, at the meeting, and I won't speak on behalf of the police department, let residents know that this is an ongoing and active investigation that's taking place and that they're putting all their resources into finding out exactly what happened and that a step up in patrol was going to happen also within that area.

30
00:02:29,028 --> 00:02:51,465
[SPEAKER_06]: as well as some recommendations that were offered by the chief about to increase lighting in certain areas in that particular vicinity, and also the fact that additional cameras within the police department would help to help solve some crime within our community.

31
00:02:51,945 --> 00:02:56,789
[SPEAKER_06]: But, Mr. President, I offer this resolution tonight because at the meeting,

32
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:14,683
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the officers spoke up and directed his comments towards members of the city council, stating that it would be helpful, because other surrounding communities do it, if they could have what I would refer to as a revolving account that's within the police department.

33
00:03:15,164 --> 00:03:18,306
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the account, in my opinion, could be within DPW.

34
00:03:18,606 --> 00:03:19,687
[SPEAKER_06]: It could be here at City Hall.

35
00:03:20,048 --> 00:03:21,809
[SPEAKER_06]: But to have a revolving account that

36
00:03:22,401 --> 00:03:39,114
[SPEAKER_06]: Fines, when people are caught doing graffiti, fines of whatever is issued will go directly into the revolving account and can only be used for appropriation to remove graffiti within our community.

37
00:03:40,154 --> 00:03:43,637
[SPEAKER_06]: I also had the opportunity to look at some of the surrounding communities.

38
00:03:44,644 --> 00:03:53,830
[SPEAKER_06]: And I noticed that the city of Somerville has a program which they handle similarly with an account.

39
00:03:54,391 --> 00:03:56,952
[SPEAKER_06]: But they take it one step further on their website.

40
00:03:57,733 --> 00:04:11,342
[SPEAKER_06]: They also offer, which I'm going to add to my paper tonight, Mr. President, is that graffiti knows no age, no sex, no orientation, no, you know, people vandalize for whatever reason.

41
00:04:14,016 --> 00:04:16,998
[SPEAKER_06]: It was mentioned that it's done on private property.

42
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:19,560
[SPEAKER_06]: As we know, it's done on public property.

43
00:04:20,021 --> 00:04:22,322
[SPEAKER_06]: As we experienced, it's done in parks.

44
00:04:23,223 --> 00:04:24,604
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's done throughout the community.

45
00:04:25,305 --> 00:04:30,388
[SPEAKER_06]: And the fact that someone may tag a public building, it's easy to city contacts.

46
00:04:30,449 --> 00:04:34,371
[SPEAKER_06]: I know in the past, Mr. President, you work at the sheriff's office.

47
00:04:34,392 --> 00:04:39,355
[SPEAKER_06]: They've been gracious enough to come out with their itty graffiti machine and clean the graffiti.

48
00:04:41,257 --> 00:04:53,842
[SPEAKER_06]: But if it's done on private property, some communities have city ordinances that require homeowners to remove the graffiti within a certain amount of time.

49
00:04:54,822 --> 00:04:57,503
[SPEAKER_06]: And that adds insult to injury, in my opinion.

50
00:04:57,943 --> 00:05:07,727
[SPEAKER_06]: The fact that you're at home, someone tags the outside of your vinyl siding, and the next day you receive a call from the city saying

51
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,641
[SPEAKER_06]: You have 10 days to remove the graffiti.

52
00:05:11,661 --> 00:05:14,422
[SPEAKER_06]: You may not have the means to remove it.

53
00:05:14,902 --> 00:05:23,764
[SPEAKER_06]: You may need to have the graffiti remain on your house for a period of time for insurance purposes and a whole issue of items.

54
00:05:24,505 --> 00:05:33,327
[SPEAKER_06]: And why I bring this up is the city of Somerville has a contract, and it's right on their website, and I have copies if anyone wants to see it.

55
00:05:34,196 --> 00:05:37,677
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's removal of graffiti agreement and release of liability.

56
00:05:38,437 --> 00:05:39,937
[SPEAKER_06]: And I won't read it, Mr. President.

57
00:05:39,957 --> 00:05:41,258
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a page long.

58
00:05:41,778 --> 00:06:03,023
[SPEAKER_06]: But it goes over the fact that if the city is willing to go onto private property and remove graffiti from the side of a home or a garage or wherever it may be, that the homeowner will hold the city free from liability, and they'll remove the graffiti at no expense to the homeowner.

59
00:06:03,827 --> 00:06:10,893
[SPEAKER_06]: And I thought that's a great idea, Mr. President, to eradicate graffiti in a community.

60
00:06:11,434 --> 00:06:23,844
[SPEAKER_06]: I know the city of Malden also, just recently in March, they introduced a new service that they provide to residents.

61
00:06:24,664 --> 00:06:27,127
[SPEAKER_06]: And they modeled it after the city of Boston.

62
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:32,471
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's modeled after the Citizens Connect smartphone application.

63
00:06:32,895 --> 00:06:34,815
[SPEAKER_06]: that the city of Boston currently uses.

64
00:06:35,356 --> 00:06:37,136
[SPEAKER_06]: And Malden just started this in March.

65
00:06:38,056 --> 00:06:46,898
[SPEAKER_06]: And they stated that, as an example, if a resident sees graffiti on the street, they would normally call or email the Department of Public Works.

66
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:50,899
[SPEAKER_06]: Now a resident can simply take a picture using their smartphone.

67
00:06:51,259 --> 00:06:54,860
[SPEAKER_06]: With one click, the request is automatically sent to the department.

68
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:59,041
[SPEAKER_06]: Once the graffiti is removed, the resident is notified on their smartphone.

69
00:06:59,417 --> 00:07:00,898
[SPEAKER_06]: that the issue has been resolved.

70
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:08,143
[SPEAKER_06]: They stated also in their press release, we are already seeing great results from the program.

71
00:07:08,863 --> 00:07:13,406
[SPEAKER_06]: Since its release, we have had 576 requests to the DPW.

72
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:15,147
[SPEAKER_06]: Not all were graffiti.

73
00:07:15,167 --> 00:07:18,369
[SPEAKER_06]: These are just requests to DPW.

74
00:07:18,389 --> 00:07:23,412
[SPEAKER_06]: And 543 were resolved with the balance slated for spring repairs.

75
00:07:23,913 --> 00:07:28,836
[SPEAKER_06]: That equates to 94% of all issues being resolved via the new application.

76
00:07:29,281 --> 00:07:31,563
[SPEAKER_06]: And most were fixed within 24 hours.

77
00:07:32,343 --> 00:07:34,425
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a great, great application.

78
00:07:34,845 --> 00:07:39,428
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a great way to connect residents of this community to City Hall.

79
00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:50,376
[SPEAKER_06]: And also, it goes on to say that they thanked, at the time, Mayor Menino and the city of Boston for their leadership on the initiative.

80
00:07:50,796 --> 00:07:57,101
[SPEAKER_06]: And also, which I found quite interesting, they thanked Governor Patrick and Lieutenant Governor Murray

81
00:07:57,682 --> 00:08:03,444
[SPEAKER_06]: for offering funding for the applications so communities could take advantage of this technology.

82
00:08:04,164 --> 00:08:19,248
[SPEAKER_06]: So apparently there's grants or money out there that we can obtain as a community to not only have a revolving account, which is my request, but to also implement something similar to this Connect phone, smart phone.

83
00:08:19,748 --> 00:08:24,829
[SPEAKER_06]: I know Somerville uses, I think it's 311, Smart 311, I believe it is.

84
00:08:29,248 --> 00:08:34,252
[SPEAKER_06]: 311 to allow residents to contact the city.

85
00:08:34,592 --> 00:08:39,376
[SPEAKER_06]: They get a response back immediately saying that their request was accepted, the date and time.

86
00:08:39,857 --> 00:08:45,361
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, within a period of time, they're contacted by the city with updates.

87
00:08:45,841 --> 00:08:47,643
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just a great way of doing business.

88
00:08:48,404 --> 00:08:56,470
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would ask, Mr. President, that we not only have the administration look into setting up a revolving account

89
00:08:57,291 --> 00:09:02,052
[SPEAKER_06]: exclusively for the purpose of graffiti removal in our community.

90
00:09:03,893 --> 00:09:16,356
[SPEAKER_06]: We also look into this particular Citizens Connect smartphone application to allow residents the expanded means of communicating with the community.

91
00:09:17,076 --> 00:09:26,558
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, Mr. President, I received a number of e-mails because of this resolution, and one resident who asked if they can appear before the council

92
00:09:27,716 --> 00:09:44,488
[SPEAKER_06]: Couldn't make it tonight, but will be before the council in the near future, is applying for a mural funding from the Meffitt Arts Council and also from the Senator Charles E. Shannon Community Safety Initiative.

93
00:09:45,228 --> 00:09:49,931
[SPEAKER_06]: And from what I understand, it's going to be very similar to the mural at the Meffitt Hillside.

94
00:09:50,712 --> 00:09:52,033
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're looking to put a mural.

95
00:09:52,713 --> 00:09:56,896
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to let the cat out of the bag, because this woman has done a lot of work on this.

96
00:09:57,623 --> 00:10:01,205
[SPEAKER_06]: But somewhere in South Bedford, they already received approval for a mural.

97
00:10:02,025 --> 00:10:13,570
[SPEAKER_06]: And this, in my opinion, will go a long way to covering up a wall that is typically, this particular wall that she's referring to, has been tagged a number of times.

98
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:24,054
[SPEAKER_06]: And it will go a long way to beautifying the area and also making it less inviting for someone to come out and use that to tag Mr. President.

99
00:10:24,534 --> 00:10:26,635
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would ask that the paper be amended.

100
00:10:27,082 --> 00:10:34,425
[SPEAKER_06]: to include the expansion and implementation of the Citizens Connect smartphone, Mr. President.

101
00:10:35,165 --> 00:10:38,606
[SPEAKER_06]: And I look forward to the mayor's response on this.

102
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:42,507
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor.

103
00:10:42,567 --> 00:10:45,549
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Knight, and then Councilor Dello Russo.

104
00:10:46,029 --> 00:10:47,289
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much, Mr. President.

105
00:10:47,389 --> 00:10:49,630
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Knox, for bringing this resolution forward.

106
00:10:50,154 --> 00:10:55,197
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is a great proactive approach to improving the quality of life for residents here in the city of Medford.

107
00:10:55,677 --> 00:11:09,545
[SPEAKER_03]: I will be voting in favor of this resolution and I might ask that the resolution be amended by way of a B paper, Mr. President, which would ask that the Medford police or the building department report back to this council locations that have been reported to have been graffitied within the last 12 months.

108
00:11:10,025 --> 00:11:16,709
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's very important that we keep track of this data to determine whether or not there were clusters and trends that are occurring here in the city so that we know where to ramp up enforcement.

109
00:11:17,233 --> 00:11:22,376
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd like to thank Councilor Marks for taking such a proactive approach to looking at the quality of life in this city.

110
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:24,837
[SPEAKER_03]: And I will be voting in favor of this resolution, Mr. President.

111
00:11:24,878 --> 00:11:31,161
[SPEAKER_03]: I just ask that it be amended for the Police Department of the powers that be to report back any locations that have been reported within the last calendar year.

112
00:11:31,882 --> 00:11:32,582
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor.

113
00:11:32,622 --> 00:11:35,524
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Dello Russo.

114
00:11:35,724 --> 00:11:37,145
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

115
00:11:37,685 --> 00:11:42,208
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to also extend my thanks to Councilor Marks for bringing this matter up.

116
00:11:42,548 --> 00:11:46,410
[SPEAKER_02]: If my memory serves me correctly, I think it was President Emeritus Mayorko

117
00:11:47,294 --> 00:12:13,376
[SPEAKER_02]: several years ago had suggested an ordinance to deal with graffiti, and I think it got tied down in committee, and one of the sticking points to it, if my memory serves me right, was that this would sometimes, in dealing with the graffiti, one of the things that you've addressed in this is that it can often place the victims of graffiti, the property owner,

118
00:12:14,798 --> 00:12:21,262
[SPEAKER_02]: also has the additional burden of finding a way to deal with this, get the graffiti cleaned up.

119
00:12:21,903 --> 00:12:32,730
[SPEAKER_02]: And for some people, whether they might own a home or a place of business, the cleanup of such an act is also a burden and may not be covered

120
00:12:33,368 --> 00:12:36,329
[SPEAKER_02]: under their homeowners or business insurance.

121
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:45,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so I, I'm glad that, uh, in your proposal, we have a remedy for that and, uh, you can count on my support as well.

122
00:12:46,795 --> 00:12:47,115
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

123
00:12:47,155 --> 00:12:49,696
[SPEAKER_11]: Council vice-president Caraviello and then councilor Lungo.

124
00:12:50,016 --> 00:12:50,316
[SPEAKER_11]: Kern.

125
00:12:50,516 --> 00:12:51,297
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

126
00:12:51,417 --> 00:12:55,979
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I want to commend, uh, my council Marks on, uh, on his motion here.

127
00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:00,461
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I'd like to see that the city look into possibly buying a machine.

128
00:13:00,941 --> 00:13:02,002
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, I mean, all they are is a,

129
00:13:03,863 --> 00:13:10,765
[SPEAKER_05]: And if there are grants available, why can't we buy our own machine so we don't have to keep going and looking for one?

130
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:24,628
[SPEAKER_05]: And also, Mr. President, I'd like to send a letter to the mayor asking him to ask the sheriff if he could come down with the graffiti team and maybe clean up some of the stuff that's down here now.

131
00:13:25,229 --> 00:13:26,749
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if that's already been asked.

132
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:32,432
[SPEAKER_05]: Because as I say, there is, like on Harvard Street, I know the T's already cleaned it a couple of times.

133
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:38,796
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you get on Forest Street, there's a couple of, there's the big old building, it's been tagged.

134
00:13:39,876 --> 00:13:42,397
[SPEAKER_05]: It is an eyesore.

135
00:13:42,638 --> 00:13:46,260
[SPEAKER_05]: There's been some tagging on the side of that sound wall.

136
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,862
[SPEAKER_05]: As I say, if the Sheriff's Department could come down and help us out there.

137
00:13:49,902 --> 00:13:58,046
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, if there is some grant money, why can't we buy our own power washer, high end power washer to do that ourselves rather than hiring a company to do it?

138
00:13:58,902 --> 00:13:59,862
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Vice President.

139
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:06,504
[SPEAKER_11]: On the main motion, amended by Councilor Marks, Councilor Knight, and Vice President Caraviello, Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

140
00:14:07,144 --> 00:14:08,405
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, President Camuso.

141
00:14:08,445 --> 00:14:10,325
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank Councilor Marks for putting this on.

142
00:14:11,306 --> 00:14:22,089
[SPEAKER_00]: Councilor Caraviello, Marks, and I were at that meeting, the police meeting, community meeting, and we spoke an hour, you know, we got updates on the South Medford shooting,

143
00:14:23,103 --> 00:14:31,810
[SPEAKER_00]: The next most spoken about subject was the graffiti and how it's an eyesore, how Somerville is getting tough on their graffiti.

144
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:34,832
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's bringing more down, especially in the South Medford area.

145
00:14:35,453 --> 00:14:40,637
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's people also complaining about it in West Medford, in Medford Square.

146
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:41,558
[SPEAKER_00]: It is everywhere.

147
00:14:41,578 --> 00:14:43,479
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, people are tagging for fun.

148
00:14:43,539 --> 00:14:47,102
[SPEAKER_00]: People are tagging to break the rules, break the law.

149
00:14:47,543 --> 00:14:51,406
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think if Somerville's getting tough on it, I think it's time Medford does too.

150
00:14:53,322 --> 00:15:06,992
[SPEAKER_00]: put on the agenda and try to get certain spots cleaned up, but I think an ordinance creating a revolving account is a great way to do it, so I thank Councilor Marks for putting this on.

151
00:15:07,012 --> 00:15:08,973
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely am in favour of the paper.

152
00:15:08,993 --> 00:15:16,699
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we need to stop the repeat tagging and just the fact that it's everywhere.

153
00:15:16,719 --> 00:15:22,322
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we should spend a portion of the money that comes into the revolving account, not only to clean up the

154
00:15:23,561 --> 00:15:28,022
[SPEAKER_00]: like we spoke about last week, on cameras so that we can catch these offenders.

155
00:15:28,442 --> 00:15:35,064
[SPEAKER_00]: We can catch them, we can find them, and we can make that revolving account, clean up all the graffiti within our community.

156
00:15:35,164 --> 00:15:39,146
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would hope that some of that money would go to be spent on cameras.

157
00:15:39,826 --> 00:15:49,849
[SPEAKER_00]: I also wanted to just, Councilman Marks brought up Citizen Connect smartphone, and I know it goes along with the 311 system that Somerville uses.

158
00:15:50,329 --> 00:15:53,210
[SPEAKER_00]: I happen to be in Somerville today, and they are giving out magnets.

159
00:15:54,295 --> 00:15:59,217
[SPEAKER_00]: with regards to if it's not an emergency and you need us or any other city service, you call 311.

160
00:16:00,058 --> 00:16:03,659
[SPEAKER_00]: I brought this up maybe four or five months ago.

161
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:09,022
[SPEAKER_00]: We voted 7-0 to get this installed in Medford, this program.

162
00:16:09,542 --> 00:16:19,327
[SPEAKER_00]: It will provide accountability and it's something that our residents deserve because I'm sure we're all sick of saying, hearing, when is my sidewalk gonna get fixed?

163
00:16:19,427 --> 00:16:21,908
[SPEAKER_00]: When is my street pothole gonna be repaved?

164
00:16:22,327 --> 00:16:29,631
[SPEAKER_00]: all the DPW, you know, they'll say it's going to be done, or you're on the list, especially with sidewalk repairs.

165
00:16:29,651 --> 00:16:31,092
[SPEAKER_00]: You're on the list, you're on the list.

166
00:16:31,392 --> 00:16:33,493
[SPEAKER_00]: We really don't know what happens with that list.

167
00:16:33,793 --> 00:16:37,575
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a way for accountability, for response, and for action.

168
00:16:38,075 --> 00:16:45,799
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I'm going to see if I can amend your paper council marks and again vote that City of Medford implement the 311 program.

169
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:46,720
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's

170
00:16:47,856 --> 00:16:49,236
[SPEAKER_00]: an absolute great idea.

171
00:16:49,616 --> 00:16:55,778
[SPEAKER_00]: I've spoken to people in the building department at the city of Somerville, and they don't know what they would do without it.

172
00:16:56,278 --> 00:17:02,699
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's time for Medford to become accountable for all the complaints that come in, issues and concerns.

173
00:17:03,479 --> 00:17:06,580
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you again, Councilor Marks, and I'd like to amend the paper.

174
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:07,440
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

175
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,660
[SPEAKER_05]: Chair recognizes Vice President Caraviello.

176
00:17:09,901 --> 00:17:10,541
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

177
00:17:10,741 --> 00:17:12,161
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to say one thing.

178
00:17:13,401 --> 00:17:16,982
[SPEAKER_05]: At the meeting, the chief talked about see something, say something.

179
00:17:17,438 --> 00:17:21,660
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you know, some of these tags, I mean, they're not like one minute tags.

180
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,782
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if you're going to Harvest Street, that had to take a half an hour to do that.

181
00:17:25,162 --> 00:17:27,563
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone had to be driving by and seeing this and not say something.

182
00:17:27,944 --> 00:17:32,326
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, on Forest Street, they climbed up to the third floor of the back of the building.

183
00:17:32,346 --> 00:17:35,788
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, so I mean, it isn't that, you know, you're spraying something and you're running away.

184
00:17:36,248 --> 00:17:43,492
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if someone had to see things during this time, again, if you see something, say something, call the police so they can get caught in the act.

185
00:17:45,825 --> 00:17:51,508
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion amended by Vice President Caraviello, Councilor Marks, Councilor Lungo-Koehn and Councilor Knight.

186
00:17:52,068 --> 00:17:52,848
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favour?

187
00:17:53,729 --> 00:17:54,409
[SPEAKER_11]: All those opposed?

188
00:17:54,429 --> 00:17:57,790
[SPEAKER_11]: The roll call has been requested by Councilor Marks.

189
00:17:57,850 --> 00:17:58,691
[SPEAKER_11]: The clerk will call the roll.

190
00:18:01,572 --> 00:18:03,353
[SPEAKER_12]: Vice President Caraviello?

191
00:18:03,413 --> 00:18:03,673
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

192
00:18:04,353 --> 00:18:05,134
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor De La Russa?

193
00:18:05,174 --> 00:18:05,254
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

194
00:18:05,994 --> 00:18:06,514
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Knight?

195
00:18:06,534 --> 00:18:07,254
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

196
00:18:07,274 --> 00:18:07,895
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn?

197
00:18:07,955 --> 00:18:08,035
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

198
00:18:08,775 --> 00:18:09,435
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Marks?

199
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:09,816
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

200
00:18:10,116 --> 00:18:10,616
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Panta?

201
00:18:10,636 --> 00:18:10,696
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

202
00:18:12,441 --> 00:18:17,142
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, by a vote of seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes as amended.

203
00:18:17,882 --> 00:18:21,363
[SPEAKER_11]: Item 14-686, offered by Councilor Penta.

204
00:18:21,903 --> 00:18:27,984
[SPEAKER_11]: Be it resolved that a comparison of public safety issues compared to the mayor's pay to park proposal be discussed.

205
00:18:28,464 --> 00:18:29,124
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Penta.

206
00:18:29,584 --> 00:18:39,886
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, I think in part we all know that around 5 o'clock or 5.30 this evening, I think we received the mayor's press release.

207
00:18:40,506 --> 00:18:43,428
[SPEAKER_08]: that he'd signed the contract with Republic from Tennessee.

208
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:44,749
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'll get to that later on.

209
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:46,931
[SPEAKER_08]: It's still part of the comparison.

210
00:18:47,672 --> 00:18:51,174
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, when we came on board at the beginning of the year, we were asked to give what our priorities were.

211
00:18:51,515 --> 00:18:55,418
[SPEAKER_08]: And I believe the police department and police station was our number one priority.

212
00:18:56,018 --> 00:19:01,182
[SPEAKER_08]: And unfortunately, it hasn't found itself anywhere in any of the mayor's agendas.

213
00:19:01,803 --> 00:19:05,966
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, the police station would derive an extreme benefit for our community.

214
00:19:07,027 --> 00:19:08,828
[SPEAKER_08]: It would make us go forward.

215
00:19:09,571 --> 00:19:19,895
[SPEAKER_08]: not only socially, but as a community going forward with tomorrow's technology, and it would also give a presence of community policing.

216
00:19:20,516 --> 00:19:26,818
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's something I think a lot of the people asking for, more police officers, more patrolmen, more visibility.

217
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:33,041
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you give them a better place to work out of, then I think that would go a long way.

218
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:36,422
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we paid in excess, I think, of $78,000

219
00:19:38,979 --> 00:19:45,041
[SPEAKER_08]: when we received the feasibility study from the police department and the fire department on May 5th of this year.

220
00:19:45,881 --> 00:19:48,422
[SPEAKER_08]: And unfortunately for the police department, they didn't get anything out of it.

221
00:19:49,182 --> 00:19:52,023
[SPEAKER_08]: Fire department did, but the police department didn't.

222
00:19:52,864 --> 00:20:03,047
[SPEAKER_08]: And once again, I don't know, maybe it's just the mayor, he doesn't have it on his radar screen, but public safety, I believe is the first of priorities here of any of all the councilors.

223
00:20:04,168 --> 00:20:08,509
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of the things that Mr. Mayor, that would be beneficial, not only for our community,

224
00:20:09,378 --> 00:20:17,263
[SPEAKER_08]: is the council has supported, in each and every calendar budget, the recycling of two new cruises each and every year.

225
00:20:18,363 --> 00:20:33,872
[SPEAKER_08]: And that would go a long way, once again, to add to the police officers on duty, driving their cruises, letting them know that the city is thinking about them, and they don't have to drive in a car that has about 140,000 miles on it, and they don't know if it's gonna make it or not.

226
00:20:33,892 --> 00:20:36,674
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it was Councilor Marks, three years ago,

227
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,221
[SPEAKER_08]: came up with the idea of why can't we have a special truck enforcement unit?

228
00:20:41,321 --> 00:20:42,261
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a great idea.

229
00:20:43,522 --> 00:20:49,164
[SPEAKER_08]: What's wrong with training one or two people to be involved with truck enforcement for that particular purpose?

230
00:20:49,584 --> 00:20:57,947
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I think we can go down any one of these streets in any one of these days, and we see the amount of trucks that travel down High Street, Main Street, or the major streets here in the city of Medford.

231
00:20:58,407 --> 00:20:59,407
[SPEAKER_08]: That would go a long way.

232
00:21:00,588 --> 00:21:05,169
[SPEAKER_08]: In our public safety issue regarding lighting, all the squares are just dimly lit.

233
00:21:06,069 --> 00:21:07,830
[SPEAKER_08]: And that in and of itself is an invitation

234
00:21:08,356 --> 00:21:10,538
[SPEAKER_08]: for some type of crime, whatever the crime might be.

235
00:21:11,358 --> 00:21:14,120
[SPEAKER_08]: You get Route 16, the parking lot behind St.

236
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:14,481
[SPEAKER_08]: Joe's.

237
00:21:14,981 --> 00:21:19,544
[SPEAKER_08]: This will probably be the 14th time that we've discussed this, and still no lighting.

238
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:28,871
[SPEAKER_08]: We've had situations there where a lady called up and she was afraid to get into a car because of people there, and also in a separate situation where a drug transaction was reported.

239
00:21:29,572 --> 00:21:33,655
[SPEAKER_08]: Also right here in Medford Square, the Route 16 overpass, underpass on Route 93,

240
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:35,450
[SPEAKER_08]: has no lights.

241
00:21:36,091 --> 00:21:39,932
[SPEAKER_08]: Riverside Avenue, go underneath the overpass there, still no lights.

242
00:21:40,812 --> 00:21:45,094
[SPEAKER_08]: We have asked for the issue of public safety, timely street swiping.

243
00:21:45,514 --> 00:21:47,575
[SPEAKER_08]: We've also asked for our crosswalk painting.

244
00:21:48,095 --> 00:21:49,795
[SPEAKER_08]: You're lucky if you see that once a year.

245
00:21:50,856 --> 00:21:52,716
[SPEAKER_08]: These aren't huge cost items.

246
00:21:52,756 --> 00:21:55,697
[SPEAKER_08]: These are items that are readily available within our budget.

247
00:21:56,538 --> 00:22:00,039
[SPEAKER_08]: Now we've talked about police cameras and high visibility locations.

248
00:22:01,151 --> 00:22:12,075
[SPEAKER_08]: Were it not for the business merchant that owned a store on the corner of George and Winthrop Street a few years, a couple of years back, how they caught the guy that assaulted the young lady from Tufts University.

249
00:22:13,255 --> 00:22:17,497
[SPEAKER_08]: And as a result of that, Mr. President, we all know that the cameras are beneficial.

250
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:23,243
[SPEAKER_08]: We have $8,893 in our linkage account for where they could buy a few cameras.

251
00:22:23,764 --> 00:22:28,367
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you really want to get into it, we have $6,400,000 in our free cash account.

252
00:22:28,967 --> 00:22:33,610
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't think there should be any reason why we can't go out there and buy any cameras.

253
00:22:34,371 --> 00:22:37,373
[SPEAKER_08]: A bonus to our people that work.

254
00:22:37,433 --> 00:22:40,695
[SPEAKER_08]: We can review the one day a week and swap day reward.

255
00:22:41,095 --> 00:22:44,458
[SPEAKER_08]: And that would be for those officers with a perfect attendance for six months.

256
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:48,100
[SPEAKER_08]: Something different, something creative for the police officers.

257
00:22:48,706 --> 00:22:55,190
[SPEAKER_08]: rather than the annual, it's on a six month basis, and that might work out, it's a tryout, it's something to think about.

258
00:22:56,550 --> 00:23:04,095
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we should also think about revisiting the idea of having retired police personnel be part of the parking enforcement proposal here in the city of Medford.

259
00:23:04,815 --> 00:23:16,942
[SPEAKER_08]: Because that in and of itself, that in and of itself would bring a big luxury, not only to the people here in this community, but I think to the business people who would have a better idea of knowing

260
00:23:17,748 --> 00:23:20,049
[SPEAKER_08]: when and how to tag certain folks.

261
00:23:20,089 --> 00:23:24,352
[SPEAKER_08]: Because we really don't know what this out-of-state company from Tennessee is going to be like.

262
00:23:24,952 --> 00:23:28,654
[SPEAKER_08]: They could just be, I don't know, they're going to start at 7 o'clock in the morning to 7 at night.

263
00:23:28,674 --> 00:23:29,635
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't make any sense.

264
00:23:30,115 --> 00:23:31,996
[SPEAKER_08]: Boston doesn't even start till 8 o'clock in the morning.

265
00:23:33,217 --> 00:23:35,938
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a civil defense system that needs to be addressed.

266
00:23:36,418 --> 00:23:41,581
[SPEAKER_08]: Since Mr. Mangone has passed on as its civil defense director, I don't know where it is.

267
00:23:42,242 --> 00:23:42,902
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it in limbo?

268
00:23:43,122 --> 00:23:43,902
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it going to be used?

269
00:23:44,503 --> 00:23:44,843
[SPEAKER_08]: If not,

270
00:23:45,657 --> 00:23:49,079
[SPEAKER_08]: We've talked about a snow emergency system, and we haven't heard anything back on that.

271
00:23:49,099 --> 00:23:55,724
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think we're all aware of the fact that a snow emergency system of some type needs to be in place.

272
00:23:56,545 --> 00:24:14,778
[SPEAKER_08]: And taking some of these issues and putting them on the left, then I go to the right, and I look at this idea of this new proposal that, if you agree or disagree, the mayor signed into effect apparently today regarding this Tennessee firm Republic.

273
00:24:15,834 --> 00:24:22,819
[SPEAKER_08]: regarding a traffic enforcement program that's going to be six days a week from 7 in the morning to 7 p.m.

274
00:24:22,839 --> 00:24:23,199
[SPEAKER_08]: at night.

275
00:24:23,619 --> 00:24:25,280
[SPEAKER_08]: There'll be no free parking on the streets.

276
00:24:25,921 --> 00:24:41,111
[SPEAKER_08]: According to the mayor's commentary, there's going to be two 30-minute parking spots in each one of the squares, and there'll be four paid single-space meter spots in each of the four square districts.

277
00:24:41,652 --> 00:24:43,933
[SPEAKER_08]: Other than that, there'll be kiosks allotted.

278
00:24:45,652 --> 00:25:00,036
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of like interesting because if you look at the commentary made by the director from the Medford Chamber of Commerce, Mr. White, he indicated that he was hoping that he would have an opportunity with its members to sit down and discuss this.

279
00:25:00,196 --> 00:25:08,539
[SPEAKER_08]: And he also made reference to the fact that each and every one of the squares have unique positions, unique concerns as it relates to businesses and how they might be affected.

280
00:25:09,459 --> 00:25:12,960
[SPEAKER_08]: How the mayor came up to this resolution and signing, I don't know.

281
00:25:13,459 --> 00:25:19,882
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's kind of like unfair because we were in that meeting on September 10th, and we were told that he would get back to us.

282
00:25:20,742 --> 00:25:23,984
[SPEAKER_08]: We were told that there'd be a public meeting for which this council voted seven to nothing.

283
00:25:24,724 --> 00:25:25,705
[SPEAKER_08]: He never honored that.

284
00:25:26,345 --> 00:25:31,247
[SPEAKER_08]: We were told also that the concerns that would be brought up would be addressed and to have an idea.

285
00:25:31,767 --> 00:25:42,212
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, and we don't really know what part of the business community, what businesses are going to be exempt from not having a meter or a kiosk anywhere in that particular area.

286
00:25:43,066 --> 00:25:50,169
[SPEAKER_08]: You take these two things and you ask yourself, the Medford Police Department and public safety is such a huge issue here in this community.

287
00:25:50,709 --> 00:25:54,171
[SPEAKER_08]: And some of the samples that I just talked about still have yet to be addressed.

288
00:25:54,971 --> 00:26:07,737
[SPEAKER_08]: But the mayor thinks it's more important to go forward with a parking enforcement program, strike that, a paid to park program with enforcement that's only going to bring in $300,000 the first year and $700,000 from the second to the ninth year, it's the 10th year.

289
00:26:12,406 --> 00:26:38,618
[SPEAKER_08]: May sound like a lot of money, but my feeling personally would have been, had the city decided to go forward after that meeting on the 10th, having an opportunity to listen to the folks within our community, listen to the business in the community, all four areas of this community, rather than have one size fits all, which includes Medford Square, in the press release as outlined tonight at 510,

290
00:26:39,947 --> 00:26:42,488
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't think it serves in the best interest of our community.

291
00:26:43,148 --> 00:26:56,613
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think it helps our police department, and I don't think it gives the community in and of itself a fair shot as it relates to priorities that need to be addressed rather than another money enhancement for the city of Medford.

292
00:26:57,853 --> 00:27:07,576
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, today, as you know, I'm assuming all of you know that the mayor signed this contract tonight around 517 or thereabouts.

293
00:27:08,397 --> 00:27:09,357
[SPEAKER_08]: He signed the contract.

294
00:27:09,758 --> 00:27:14,040
[SPEAKER_08]: And he makes a notation that the council was in support of this.

295
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:24,564
[SPEAKER_08]: What the council was in support of was that on May 20th, when we had that meeting, we had agreed to the three vendors that came in, one would be selected, which was Republic from Tennessee.

296
00:27:25,264 --> 00:27:30,547
[SPEAKER_08]: But we agreed to that somebody would come back after he had negotiations and we would discuss it.

297
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:32,347
[SPEAKER_08]: And we did on September 10th.

298
00:27:32,988 --> 00:27:36,889
[SPEAKER_08]: But when the pushback came back, the mayor decided not to go forward at that time.

299
00:27:37,709 --> 00:27:38,970
[SPEAKER_08]: And speaking to Mr. Skelton,

300
00:27:39,443 --> 00:27:42,225
[SPEAKER_08]: are referring to Mr. Skelton's comments from Republic.

301
00:27:42,726 --> 00:27:48,751
[SPEAKER_08]: From the 10th to the 25th of September, there was absolutely no communication between the mayor and Republic.

302
00:27:49,411 --> 00:27:53,054
[SPEAKER_08]: So something had to take place from the 24th to today, the 7th.

303
00:27:53,915 --> 00:28:00,801
[SPEAKER_08]: And taking that into consideration, it's quite obvious that the chamber's concerns, oh, I don't know who wrote the letter because we don't have a copy of the letter.

304
00:28:01,081 --> 00:28:02,402
[SPEAKER_08]: He says he got a letter from the chamber.

305
00:28:02,963 --> 00:28:08,387
[SPEAKER_08]: But when you have four separate squares, including Medford Square, which makes five, and their issues are all unique,

306
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:20,077
[SPEAKER_08]: and they needed to be heard, and they weren't heard, and the mayor decides to have one size fits all, I don't think that's what you call a happy resolution, especially to the business people and to the taxpayers of this community.

307
00:28:20,818 --> 00:28:23,679
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, the fact of the matter is this.

308
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:32,761
[SPEAKER_08]: We're getting rid of people who don't live in the community, who were parking at spots all day long, and they haven't been tagged.

309
00:28:33,322 --> 00:28:37,983
[SPEAKER_08]: And this has been going on for the entire years of the administration of this city, this mayor.

310
00:28:38,666 --> 00:28:47,492
[SPEAKER_08]: And now what we're going to be doing is tagging, if not towing, and telling our own taxpayers in this community, you people are going to have to start paying.

311
00:28:48,072 --> 00:28:56,318
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, right up front, no free parking unless you are lucky enough to get one of those two spots in any one of the four or five sections of this community.

312
00:28:57,278 --> 00:29:00,681
[SPEAKER_08]: Where it's going, I don't know, Mr. President, but all I can tell you is this.

313
00:29:01,381 --> 00:29:08,606
[SPEAKER_08]: If I had to put my money on something, I would put it on public safety, the police department, the personnel that's needed to keep this community safe,

314
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:12,260
[SPEAKER_08]: And more importantly, the subject matters that I brought up under the police department.

315
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,360
[SPEAKER_08]: Those to me are pressing needs.

316
00:29:15,661 --> 00:29:22,403
[SPEAKER_08]: They have no comparison, no comparison at all to a parking paid to park program or enforcement.

317
00:29:23,163 --> 00:29:28,424
[SPEAKER_08]: If the mayor was so concerned about that paid to park program and enforcement, he should have done it years ago, but he didn't.

318
00:29:28,884 --> 00:29:36,687
[SPEAKER_08]: And when they knew that people from Winchester and other communities were coming here and parking all day and not getting tagged and ticketed, he should have done something, but he didn't.

319
00:29:37,607 --> 00:29:37,747
[SPEAKER_08]: So,

320
00:29:38,148 --> 00:29:46,074
[SPEAKER_08]: put $300,000 this first year out of the box, compare everything to what the police department needs to keep our community safe and protected.

321
00:29:46,535 --> 00:29:47,816
[SPEAKER_08]: It's pale in comparison.

322
00:29:48,436 --> 00:30:03,788
[SPEAKER_08]: And with that being said, Mr. President, I just wanted to say that, um, I just think, you know, this council is either going to be committed to public safety and a new PlayStation and the police department, or this is nothing more than hot air every Tuesday night when we come here to talk about public safety.

323
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:06,101
[SPEAKER_08]: We have more than enough examples.

324
00:30:06,622 --> 00:30:09,123
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think we have more than enough good police officers.

325
00:30:10,865 --> 00:30:15,708
[SPEAKER_08]: The shooting is just a drop in the bucket compared to all the drug problems that are existing throughout this community.

326
00:30:16,609 --> 00:30:17,449
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's a concern.

327
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:27,556
[SPEAKER_08]: And if they had more personnel, and if they could go to court, and if they had more of the mechanisms and the technology that is needed, it would be great.

328
00:30:28,597 --> 00:30:32,820
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, when you talk to someone, you say, hey, you're building a brand new public works department, $14 million.

329
00:30:35,258 --> 00:30:35,498
[SPEAKER_08]: $14 million.

330
00:30:35,858 --> 00:30:38,499
[SPEAKER_08]: Still don't even have enough men to man it.

331
00:30:39,159 --> 00:30:41,159
[SPEAKER_08]: But you have a police department that's ready to fall apart.

332
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:46,420
[SPEAKER_08]: You have an evidence room that's completely out of control and a whole host of other issues.

333
00:30:47,641 --> 00:30:55,862
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I would say, Mr. President and my fellow colleagues, that I think it's time that we take the stand and we tell the mayor we want a new police station.

334
00:30:56,362 --> 00:30:57,243
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't care how you fund it.

335
00:30:57,863 --> 00:31:01,343
[SPEAKER_08]: You found the money for a public works department, then find the money for a police station.

336
00:31:01,883 --> 00:31:04,624
[SPEAKER_08]: Because you're not going to make one seem to be more important than another.

337
00:31:05,046 --> 00:31:09,947
[SPEAKER_08]: And at the same time, you're not going to put the lives of this community and the folks in this community at risk.

338
00:31:13,148 --> 00:31:14,228
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice President Caraviello.

339
00:31:14,808 --> 00:31:16,128
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

340
00:31:16,868 --> 00:31:19,609
[SPEAKER_05]: I echo some of Councilor Pinto's concerns here.

341
00:31:20,409 --> 00:31:31,171
[SPEAKER_05]: Last week, after the meeting, the next day on Councilor Longo's motion on the cameras, I received a call from a gentleman from Medford, who that's what they do, about cameras.

342
00:31:31,211 --> 00:31:34,092
[SPEAKER_05]: And he'd be willing to come down to meet with the chief

343
00:31:34,565 --> 00:31:38,006
[SPEAKER_05]: He said the cost of the camera is approximately $5,000 per camera.

344
00:31:39,486 --> 00:31:43,827
[SPEAKER_05]: And this company does multiple cities and towns police forces.

345
00:31:44,367 --> 00:31:48,047
[SPEAKER_05]: So I told the chief I would refer the number over to him.

346
00:31:49,468 --> 00:31:57,209
[SPEAKER_05]: At the meeting that we were at at the police station, I did ask the chief about using retired policemen to man details and do other things.

347
00:31:57,289 --> 00:32:00,910
[SPEAKER_05]: And the chief was steadfast against that.

348
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:02,590
[SPEAKER_05]: He said he had safety concerns.

349
00:32:03,206 --> 00:32:06,288
[SPEAKER_05]: liability concerns about using recently retired policemen.

350
00:32:06,808 --> 00:32:11,771
[SPEAKER_05]: And my point was, many details go unmet because you can't find anybody.

351
00:32:14,392 --> 00:32:16,874
[SPEAKER_05]: Why couldn't you use somebody that's recently retired to come on?

352
00:32:16,894 --> 00:32:19,475
[SPEAKER_05]: But he didn't want to hear it.

353
00:32:21,556 --> 00:32:31,282
[SPEAKER_05]: One last thing, talking about the parking, one of the things I would like to see in here was maybe some type of a one-ticket amnesty program for people who

354
00:32:32,074 --> 00:32:40,357
[SPEAKER_05]: just made a mistake or whatever, for whatever reason, for maybe the first 30 days to maybe help out.

355
00:32:41,037 --> 00:32:44,458
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm going to reiterate again what I said on our first meeting in the parking.

356
00:32:45,018 --> 00:32:51,341
[SPEAKER_05]: If this is going to generate $18 to $20 million, I'd like to see all the money generated go toward the police station.

357
00:32:51,401 --> 00:32:58,043
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if we're going to go out and bond for that, let that $18 million pay for the bonds.

358
00:32:59,264 --> 00:33:02,505
[SPEAKER_05]: rather than put it into the general fund.

359
00:33:03,386 --> 00:33:07,528
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if the numbers that they give are correct.

360
00:33:08,468 --> 00:33:11,629
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know what my other counselors think about that motion.

361
00:33:14,851 --> 00:33:15,251
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

362
00:33:17,752 --> 00:33:18,312
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there a motion?

363
00:33:18,332 --> 00:33:19,213
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President.

364
00:33:19,813 --> 00:33:23,395
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Max.

365
00:33:23,515 --> 00:33:24,455
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

366
00:33:27,645 --> 00:33:34,250
[SPEAKER_06]: just read over the email that we all received, too, regarding the mayor signing the contract.

367
00:33:35,171 --> 00:33:48,120
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, I find it ironic, Mr. President, that in the mayor's opening statement, he said the city's goal is to provide the best possible parking experience for its citizens.

368
00:33:49,201 --> 00:33:55,406
[SPEAKER_06]: And you would think, Mr. President, over the last several years that this would have been a goal of the administration.

369
00:33:56,506 --> 00:34:06,672
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a spotlight, I believe it was done by Channel 5 about six months ago regarding the lack of enforcement for resident permit parking in the community.

370
00:34:07,072 --> 00:34:08,153
[SPEAKER_06]: It didn't exist at all.

371
00:34:09,274 --> 00:34:15,997
[SPEAKER_06]: So at that point, the mayor wasn't trying to provide the best experience for citizens in our community.

372
00:34:16,458 --> 00:34:23,822
[SPEAKER_06]: He also said in his statement that the objectives of this program are to deter illegal parking,

373
00:34:24,192 --> 00:34:32,537
[SPEAKER_06]: to ensure timely turnover of parking spaces, to benefit and enhance the business districts, and to create a friendly environment for consumers.

374
00:34:33,658 --> 00:34:42,724
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President, what was asked for back in 2009 was to enforce existing signage.

375
00:34:44,185 --> 00:34:52,070
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the recommendation back in 2009, to enforce existing signage and be consistent

376
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,340
[SPEAKER_06]: which never took place in this community.

377
00:34:55,160 --> 00:35:06,402
[SPEAKER_06]: So if we had consistent enforcement throughout the community, there would be no need to hire an outside company from Tennessee to outsource it to Tennessee.

378
00:35:07,343 --> 00:35:11,043
[SPEAKER_06]: We all know the contract is based on performance.

379
00:35:11,923 --> 00:35:20,625
[SPEAKER_06]: And that will result, not could, it will result in very aggressive ticketing in this community.

380
00:35:21,761 --> 00:35:25,564
[SPEAKER_06]: it will result in aggressive ticketing in this community.

381
00:35:26,505 --> 00:35:43,838
[SPEAKER_06]: So if the mayor was really intent on putting the best possible parking experience for citizens, all along, he would have provided consistent enforcement by our own in-house personnel to move these cars along.

382
00:35:44,278 --> 00:35:45,199
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree with that.

383
00:35:46,399 --> 00:35:51,163
[SPEAKER_06]: However, I don't agree with hiring an outside company, Mr. President.

384
00:35:52,183 --> 00:36:10,371
[SPEAKER_06]: It also goes along to state that one of the benefits of this particular program, and I'll quote it, it says, the chamber also acknowledged that there are several beneficial aspects of the plan, such as the user-friendly kiosk.

385
00:36:12,091 --> 00:36:20,195
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been talking to residents, I've been talking to business owners throughout the community, it's a hot topic, and I haven't heard one resident so far say, you know what,

386
00:36:21,397 --> 00:36:38,648
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't mind getting out of my car in West Method, walking four or five car lengths, which may even be a little further because there's hydrants and there's bus stops and everything else within this community crosswalks, putting my plate in the kiosk,

387
00:36:41,291 --> 00:36:49,938
[SPEAKER_06]: putting my time in the kiosk, putting my money in the kiosk, and going in the West Method Spa and getting a newspaper and going back to my car.

388
00:36:50,438 --> 00:36:56,904
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't heard one resident say that they feel that's a benefit, that they feel that that's a good idea.

389
00:36:57,816 --> 00:36:58,536
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President.

390
00:36:58,556 --> 00:37:03,097
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I'm not quite sold on the use of kiosk on the streets.

391
00:37:03,697 --> 00:37:09,659
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know any other community in this surrounding area that use kiosk on the streets, Mr. President.

392
00:37:10,039 --> 00:37:11,399
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't believe it's user-friendly.

393
00:37:11,879 --> 00:37:26,083
[SPEAKER_06]: And I believe, as was mentioned at our meeting a couple of weeks ago, that if you happen to be stopping in one of our business districts and you happen to have your kids with you, or you happen to be taking your elderly mother to a doctor's appointment,

394
00:37:26,967 --> 00:37:32,790
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not user-friendly to walk several spots to put money in a kiosk, Mr. President.

395
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:46,015
[SPEAKER_06]: It was also mentioned that the mayor was willing to settle or compromise with the business community in giving free spots throughout the community.

396
00:37:46,976 --> 00:37:52,758
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was very admirable of the mayor, but let's break it down for a second.

397
00:37:53,834 --> 00:37:59,656
[SPEAKER_06]: This plan calls for 1,000 parking spots, roughly 1,000 parking spots.

398
00:38:00,376 --> 00:38:10,540
[SPEAKER_06]: The mayor, under his new proposal that he just signed, is allotting two parking spots for 30-minute free parking in five of the business districts.

399
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,141
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's 10 spots.

400
00:38:12,661 --> 00:38:16,442
[SPEAKER_06]: That's 1% of the total parking spots.

401
00:38:17,243 --> 00:38:20,904
[SPEAKER_06]: So this great, grandioso plan that the mayor came down and

402
00:38:21,297 --> 00:38:30,966
[SPEAKER_06]: decided with the business owners who were all advocating for some sort of free parking, albeit limited free parking, but some sort of free parking.

403
00:38:31,427 --> 00:38:37,653
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, the mayor was gracious enough to give us 10 spots citywide.

404
00:38:38,493 --> 00:38:46,041
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you happen to be in Method Square, there may be a spot down by the CVS, down by Carlene's.

405
00:38:46,966 --> 00:38:52,249
[SPEAKER_06]: And there may be a spot on the east side, all the way down by City Hall.

406
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:55,512
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are your two spots for free parking.

407
00:38:56,933 --> 00:38:59,534
[SPEAKER_06]: Doesn't seem like a lot to me, Mr. President.

408
00:39:00,215 --> 00:39:04,898
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't think it's what the business owners intended on.

409
00:39:05,778 --> 00:39:14,524
[SPEAKER_06]: Secondly, Mr. President, this council asked several times, and recently a couple of weeks ago, to hold a public hearing.

410
00:39:15,916 --> 00:39:29,704
[SPEAKER_06]: to allow residents, business owners, anyone interested to come up and address the council, address the mayor, address the administration, address this company from Tennessee, and the mayor refused to hold a public hearing.

411
00:39:30,104 --> 00:39:35,127
[SPEAKER_06]: He kept on going back saying, don't forget, there was a public hearing in September 2009.

412
00:39:35,167 --> 00:39:36,187
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Mayor, that was five years ago.

413
00:39:41,926 --> 00:39:43,487
[SPEAKER_06]: Things change in five years.

414
00:39:43,807 --> 00:39:47,029
[SPEAKER_06]: There are new residents in this community over the past five years.

415
00:39:47,269 --> 00:39:49,450
[SPEAKER_06]: There are new business owners in this community.

416
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:53,132
[SPEAKER_06]: There are new challenges facing our residents and our business owners.

417
00:39:54,152 --> 00:40:01,216
[SPEAKER_06]: And to go based on a hearing that took place five years ago, the mayor must have his head stuck in the sand.

418
00:40:03,637 --> 00:40:08,039
[SPEAKER_06]: So there was no input from this council, and I speak for myself.

419
00:40:09,309 --> 00:40:15,724
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'd like to know if any member of this council was able to effectively make change in the mayor's proposal.

420
00:40:16,385 --> 00:40:17,006
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to hear it.

421
00:40:18,151 --> 00:40:22,775
[SPEAKER_06]: Because every time I offered something, the mayor just poo-pooed it.

422
00:40:22,796 --> 00:40:23,676
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that can't be done.

423
00:40:23,716 --> 00:40:24,817
[SPEAKER_06]: We can't do it like that.

424
00:40:25,238 --> 00:40:28,081
[SPEAKER_06]: This was the mayor's proposal from the start.

425
00:40:28,941 --> 00:40:34,847
[SPEAKER_06]: No one had any input, the business owners, nor the residents of this community, Mr. President.

426
00:40:35,308 --> 00:40:40,433
[SPEAKER_06]: I know the mayor, in his statement, keeps on going back, saying the business owners and the chamber are on board.

427
00:40:41,093 --> 00:40:45,055
[SPEAKER_06]: What about the 56,000 residents of this community?

428
00:40:45,735 --> 00:40:46,975
[SPEAKER_06]: What input do they have?

429
00:40:47,436 --> 00:40:49,636
[SPEAKER_06]: They're the ones that traverse the businesses.

430
00:40:49,997 --> 00:40:55,979
[SPEAKER_06]: They're the ones that go to the schools and the churches and the medical appointments in this community.

431
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:59,020
[SPEAKER_06]: Why do they have no input, Mr. President?

432
00:41:00,321 --> 00:41:08,304
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I don't know why the mayor decided to craft this program in a vacuum.

433
00:41:10,165 --> 00:41:15,408
[SPEAKER_06]: He crafted it, as he stated three weeks ago, with members of his departments.

434
00:41:16,569 --> 00:41:19,811
[SPEAKER_06]: That who has ultimately made the final decision.

435
00:41:20,312 --> 00:41:24,334
[SPEAKER_06]: Members of his department heads made the decisions.

436
00:41:25,495 --> 00:41:32,740
[SPEAKER_06]: And then once the program went out for RFP, request for proposal, and came back, the mayor was about to sign it.

437
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:37,883
[SPEAKER_06]: And he thought better of it and said, let me have the council do a committee of the whole meeting.

438
00:41:39,056 --> 00:41:45,461
[SPEAKER_06]: where business owners came down, the ones that did know about it came down, and they offered many suggestions.

439
00:41:47,362 --> 00:41:58,291
[SPEAKER_06]: And I talked to a business owner tonight that was at that meeting, not gonna state his name, and he wasn't aware of the mayor just signing this, but I asked him, is that acceptable, two spots?

440
00:41:59,051 --> 00:42:00,633
[SPEAKER_06]: And he said, absolutely not.

441
00:42:01,754 --> 00:42:03,375
[SPEAKER_06]: And he thought he was gonna have some input.

442
00:42:04,977 --> 00:42:06,218
[SPEAKER_06]: And he had no input at all.

443
00:42:06,598 --> 00:42:15,586
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know who the mayor met with, as Councilor Penta mentioned, but this was a decision made strictly by the administration.

444
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:28,096
[SPEAKER_06]: If the mayor was so concerned about providing such an experience for parkers in this community, why did he let resident permit parking go for so many years without enforcement?

445
00:42:29,537 --> 00:42:31,719
[SPEAKER_06]: But he collected the fee for the permit.

446
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:34,181
[SPEAKER_06]: He didn't let that go, Mr. President.

447
00:42:34,619 --> 00:42:37,961
[SPEAKER_06]: He made sure he collected the fee, but he didn't provide the enforcement.

448
00:42:38,522 --> 00:42:47,708
[SPEAKER_06]: The mayor allowed people to park from Winchester and Arlington and West Bedford for years and take the commuter rail in, and take the buses in.

449
00:42:48,128 --> 00:42:53,632
[SPEAKER_06]: He allowed them to park in Bedford Square and Haines Square for years, Mr. President, without enforcement.

450
00:42:55,273 --> 00:42:59,136
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, I'm not sold on this program, Mr. President.

451
00:42:59,396 --> 00:43:02,198
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Caraviello just mentioned the fact that

452
00:43:03,497 --> 00:43:07,518
[SPEAKER_06]: retired police officers possibly doing the role in-house.

453
00:43:08,038 --> 00:43:19,961
[SPEAKER_06]: I offered back some years ago, Mr. President, to look at having crossing guards who I spoke to the union president, said they would be more than happy to do that task.

454
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:22,001
[SPEAKER_06]: They already have uniforms.

455
00:43:22,741 --> 00:43:23,981
[SPEAKER_06]: Many of them are already trained.

456
00:43:24,742 --> 00:43:29,422
[SPEAKER_06]: And at the time, it just fell on deaf ears to take this in-house.

457
00:43:32,711 --> 00:43:34,672
[SPEAKER_06]: The mayor went off, signed it, Mr. President.

458
00:43:34,712 --> 00:43:39,555
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish him well on this, but I wish there were more public hearings.

459
00:43:40,355 --> 00:43:46,119
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish that there was more input from the community and from business owners in this community, Mr. President.

460
00:43:46,799 --> 00:43:47,920
[SPEAKER_06]: And I wish we had some time.

461
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:49,721
[SPEAKER_06]: We waited this many years.

462
00:43:50,241 --> 00:43:57,745
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish we had some time to really sit behind the table like we did a few weeks ago and really iron out some of the differences.

463
00:43:58,766 --> 00:44:00,867
[SPEAKER_06]: And we really didn't have that opportunity.

464
00:44:01,525 --> 00:44:05,027
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think the mayor fell short of the mark on this proposal.

465
00:44:05,647 --> 00:44:07,088
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's going to come back.

466
00:44:07,909 --> 00:44:12,712
[SPEAKER_06]: At some point, when the aggressive enforcement starts, it's going to come back.

467
00:44:12,792 --> 00:44:23,698
[SPEAKER_06]: And the mayor is going to do everything he can to hide behind the issue, like he did in this letter, stating, if you read half the letter, half it's about the council votes.

468
00:44:25,199 --> 00:44:27,220
[SPEAKER_06]: What member behind this reel voted on the proposal?

469
00:44:28,493 --> 00:44:33,675
[SPEAKER_06]: We voted to allow the mayor to enter into a 10-year contract because of state statute.

470
00:44:35,796 --> 00:44:40,278
[SPEAKER_06]: My vote wasn't predicated on what was involved within that proposal.

471
00:44:41,294 --> 00:44:45,155
[SPEAKER_06]: My vote was to allow them because all three bids came back for 10 years.

472
00:44:45,835 --> 00:44:54,098
[SPEAKER_06]: So at the time, the mayor presented it to us saying, I can't negotiate at all because I don't have the authority to go and negotiate anything over three years.

473
00:44:54,658 --> 00:44:56,879
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to give me the ability to negotiate.

474
00:44:57,259 --> 00:44:58,599
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what this council did.

475
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:02,541
[SPEAKER_06]: We never voted on the terms of the agreement.

476
00:45:03,021 --> 00:45:06,302
[SPEAKER_06]: Not one time did we ever vote on the terms of the agreement.

477
00:45:09,003 --> 00:45:09,843
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

478
00:45:11,653 --> 00:45:15,215
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, um, I guess I missed this when I was reading it.

479
00:45:15,895 --> 00:45:26,839
[SPEAKER_08]: If you read the bottom of the mass comment, it says the chamber also acknowledged that there were several beneficial respects to the plan, such as user friendly kiosks, whatever that means.

480
00:45:27,499 --> 00:45:35,361
[SPEAKER_08]: After deliberating and discussing concerns raised by the business community, the mayor is recommending the following changes to the plan.

481
00:45:35,962 --> 00:45:36,902
[SPEAKER_08]: He's recommending,

482
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,601
[SPEAKER_08]: This isn't a finality.

483
00:45:41,641 --> 00:45:50,844
[SPEAKER_08]: If you go to point number three, it says recommend $250,000 of the revenue generated on an annual basis to be dedicated to the business district improvements.

484
00:45:51,584 --> 00:45:52,524
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a recommendation.

485
00:45:52,965 --> 00:45:53,945
[SPEAKER_08]: This isn't a done deal.

486
00:45:54,225 --> 00:45:57,126
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you have $250,000, what district gets it first?

487
00:45:57,506 --> 00:46:00,607
[SPEAKER_08]: North Medford, South Medford, Boston Ave, Medford Square?

488
00:46:01,447 --> 00:46:02,628
[SPEAKER_08]: Where's the determination there?

489
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:05,228
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the last one, retain business and commuter permits.

490
00:46:05,609 --> 00:46:06,309
[SPEAKER_08]: What does that mean?

491
00:46:07,446 --> 00:46:08,867
[SPEAKER_08]: All subjective commentary.

492
00:46:10,148 --> 00:46:12,530
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't even know if this is really the done deal.

493
00:46:13,031 --> 00:46:14,692
[SPEAKER_08]: All he's doing, he's saying he signed it.

494
00:46:15,292 --> 00:46:18,835
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm wondering if these are still things to be negotiated.

495
00:46:19,536 --> 00:46:20,537
[SPEAKER_08]: He's recommending.

496
00:46:21,057 --> 00:46:22,238
[SPEAKER_08]: These are recommendations.

497
00:46:23,759 --> 00:46:28,443
[SPEAKER_08]: They may be just sticking to the original part of the plan and getting back to what Councilor Marks alluded to.

498
00:46:29,324 --> 00:46:31,846
[SPEAKER_08]: Not only is it going to be aggressive enforcement,

499
00:46:33,302 --> 00:46:35,402
[SPEAKER_08]: But why would you start at 7 o'clock in the morning?

500
00:46:36,083 --> 00:46:38,823
[SPEAKER_08]: Boston, which is much bigger than Medford, starts at 8.

501
00:46:40,203 --> 00:46:44,324
[SPEAKER_08]: Brookline, when they had their kiosks, they had to take them away because they were hurting the businesses.

502
00:46:46,344 --> 00:46:59,627
[SPEAKER_08]: And then if they're even recognizing by putting meters, single meters, in certain parts, well, maybe they should think about just putting meters, period, and see how that goes, and have local people do the enforcement part.

503
00:47:00,094 --> 00:47:03,096
[SPEAKER_08]: But the more I keep reading this thing, words stand off a lot.

504
00:47:03,136 --> 00:47:04,497
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the terminology that's used.

505
00:47:04,917 --> 00:47:05,757
[SPEAKER_08]: He's recommending.

506
00:47:06,037 --> 00:47:07,478
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't even know if this is a done deal.

507
00:47:07,758 --> 00:47:08,359
[SPEAKER_08]: None of us know.

508
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:14,962
[SPEAKER_08]: It's two 30-minute free parking spaces in West Medford.

509
00:47:15,243 --> 00:47:16,043
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, who's in West Medford?

510
00:47:16,063 --> 00:47:16,563
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's it going to be?

511
00:47:16,763 --> 00:47:17,664
[SPEAKER_08]: Has that been determined yet?

512
00:47:17,684 --> 00:47:18,785
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going to flip a coin?

513
00:47:20,085 --> 00:47:22,127
[SPEAKER_08]: Go to Boston Avenue, you're going to flip a coin?

514
00:47:22,587 --> 00:47:25,148
[SPEAKER_08]: The whole length of that street, two free parking spaces?

515
00:47:26,049 --> 00:47:29,791
[SPEAKER_08]: And then four paid single-space meter spots.

516
00:47:30,427 --> 00:47:31,988
[SPEAKER_08]: in each of the above listed districts.

517
00:47:33,969 --> 00:47:35,030
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's going to get those four?

518
00:47:35,791 --> 00:47:40,514
[SPEAKER_08]: And as I said before, what businesses are going to be excluded rather than included?

519
00:47:41,995 --> 00:47:49,660
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, the law is very specific on this, and I said it to you last week, and I'll say it to you again, and I said it to our chief procurement officer.

520
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:57,265
[SPEAKER_08]: The responsibility of bringing the contract forward was from the chief procurement officer, not from the mayor, and not from the budget director.

521
00:47:58,205 --> 00:47:59,146
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what the law says.

522
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:06,492
[SPEAKER_08]: And there needed to be a recommendation in writing with a comparison of doing it in-house as compared to doing it out-house.

523
00:48:07,393 --> 00:48:09,093
[SPEAKER_08]: And in this situation, we never got it.

524
00:48:09,733 --> 00:48:19,117
[SPEAKER_08]: We never got the recommendation and how that recommendation was determined so as for the council to make a legitimate vote to go forward to accept it or not.

525
00:48:20,137 --> 00:48:29,260
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's a whole host of issues that surround not only the mayor signing this or even getting to the point to having him sign it, but the fact that he lied

526
00:48:29,696 --> 00:48:43,639
[SPEAKER_08]: He lied to we, the people, by not coming and having the public forum for which seven members of this council voted on, to at least have a public forum, to at least have the business community, and at least have the taxpayers, the residents of the community, to come and speak up about it.

527
00:48:44,399 --> 00:48:47,799
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we're all getting our emails, and people are just, once again, hearing about it.

528
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:51,380
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of them, not that they're for it, not some of them against it.

529
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:53,240
[SPEAKER_08]: They want to know more about it and how it's going to work.

530
00:48:54,021 --> 00:48:55,981
[SPEAKER_08]: But apparently, the mayor doesn't want us to know.

531
00:48:56,707 --> 00:48:57,468
[SPEAKER_08]: It's quite obvious.

532
00:48:57,508 --> 00:48:59,889
[SPEAKER_08]: He certainly doesn't want the taxpayers and the residents to know.

533
00:49:00,449 --> 00:49:07,514
[SPEAKER_08]: And however he chose what businesses that he met with, who knows what businesses they were that convinced him to go forward with this.

534
00:49:07,554 --> 00:49:11,076
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a damn shame, because I don't think this serves in the best interest of our community.

535
00:49:12,557 --> 00:49:12,877
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

536
00:49:14,298 --> 00:49:15,439
[SPEAKER_11]: Name and address for the record.

537
00:49:15,479 --> 00:49:20,142
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you are here on behalf of an organization, your title and the organization, please.

538
00:49:20,202 --> 00:49:20,582
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.

539
00:49:20,622 --> 00:49:21,603
[SPEAKER_09]: My name is Jonathan White.

540
00:49:21,823 --> 00:49:23,244
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a lifelong Methodist resident.

541
00:49:23,404 --> 00:49:25,105
[SPEAKER_09]: I reside at 30 Woodland Avenue.

542
00:49:25,677 --> 00:49:27,338
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm also a business owner within the city.

543
00:49:27,378 --> 00:49:32,142
[SPEAKER_09]: I have an office at 0 Governors Avenue, and I'm here as the president of the Medford Chamber of Commerce.

544
00:49:33,243 --> 00:49:33,923
[SPEAKER_09]: Excuse my voice.

545
00:49:33,983 --> 00:49:38,667
[SPEAKER_09]: I just got off the ice coaching little kid hockey, so I'll do my best to project.

546
00:49:40,468 --> 00:49:40,729
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

547
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:41,709
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to be unequivocal.

548
00:49:42,030 --> 00:49:48,475
[SPEAKER_09]: The Medford Chamber of Commerce supports parking enforcement within the city of Medford.

549
00:49:48,975 --> 00:49:53,799
[SPEAKER_09]: We have supported parking enforcement within the city of Medford since 2009, when the issue first

550
00:49:55,939 --> 00:49:56,599
[SPEAKER_09]: came to light.

551
00:49:57,940 --> 00:50:07,746
[SPEAKER_09]: We recognize that our members in the different business districts have different needs, have different concerns as to the parking enforcement plan that we saw in September.

552
00:50:08,306 --> 00:50:22,034
[SPEAKER_09]: So as a chamber, we decided in supporting parking enforcement not to advocate for any specific need so as not to alienate any members from our overall membership.

553
00:50:22,625 --> 00:50:26,006
[SPEAKER_09]: but instead to provide them the opportunity to be heard.

554
00:50:27,467 --> 00:50:28,647
[SPEAKER_09]: We succeeded in that.

555
00:50:29,828 --> 00:50:50,176
[SPEAKER_09]: My understanding, and I haven't seen the paperwork yet, so excuse my ignorance, my understanding is the concerns were heard, there were compromises made, and there's an agreement in place that basically takes a little bit from each of the Chamber's members' concerns to make an overall plan

556
00:50:51,545 --> 00:50:54,527
[SPEAKER_09]: I've heard each of the concessions.

557
00:50:55,467 --> 00:51:01,871
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm very satisfied as the president of the Chamber of Commerce with this, and I'm very happy to have been part of the process.

558
00:51:03,212 --> 00:51:06,914
[SPEAKER_09]: For the record, since I'm here, there was an article in the transcript last week.

559
00:51:07,615 --> 00:51:14,018
[SPEAKER_09]: The reporter misquoted me, took my quotes out of context, and misconstrued.

560
00:51:14,118 --> 00:51:18,521
[SPEAKER_09]: We never once asked the mayor to not sign the document.

561
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:29,829
[SPEAKER_09]: but we asked him to make sure he continued to keep us involved as he completed the process, just as he had since 2009 when this first started.

562
00:51:30,410 --> 00:51:33,112
[SPEAKER_09]: If that meant he was delaying it, let us know.

563
00:51:33,553 --> 00:51:34,734
[SPEAKER_09]: Let us know the time frame.

564
00:51:35,314 --> 00:51:40,019
[SPEAKER_09]: Give us the opportunity to participate the way we have all along.

565
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:42,281
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

566
00:51:42,301 --> 00:51:45,043
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

567
00:51:45,063 --> 00:51:45,664
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Block?

568
00:51:47,079 --> 00:51:47,599
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President.

569
00:51:48,019 --> 00:51:51,160
[SPEAKER_06]: And I appreciate Mr. White being here on behalf of the chamber.

570
00:51:52,461 --> 00:51:55,822
[SPEAKER_06]: You just mentioned that you've participated in the process all along.

571
00:51:57,242 --> 00:52:07,806
[SPEAKER_06]: Other than the meeting we had a few weeks back, Jonathan, what other participation has the chamber had in crafting this particular proposal?

572
00:52:08,906 --> 00:52:11,687
[SPEAKER_09]: So, understanding, I'm the current president.

573
00:52:12,828 --> 00:52:13,888
[SPEAKER_09]: I was the clerk.

574
00:52:14,306 --> 00:52:16,988
[SPEAKER_09]: or general counsel for the past two years before that.

575
00:52:17,888 --> 00:52:22,250
[SPEAKER_09]: Obviously, I do have knowledge of what occurred before that, because my mother was the executive director.

576
00:52:23,671 --> 00:52:36,398
[SPEAKER_09]: So going back to 09 and moving forward, my understanding from 09 for the first few years was that the then executive director, Cheryl White, was working directly with the mayor's office on this issue.

577
00:52:36,958 --> 00:52:41,521
[SPEAKER_09]: She was reaching out to the chamber members in the different areas to find out what their concerns were.

578
00:52:42,542 --> 00:52:43,382
[SPEAKER_09]: And then that's, you know,

579
00:52:43,892 --> 00:52:47,395
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the history after that is there was the committee that you sat on was made.

580
00:52:47,495 --> 00:52:51,037
[SPEAKER_09]: But while that was happening, the mayor was consulting with the executive director.

581
00:52:52,078 --> 00:52:52,558
[SPEAKER_09]: Excuse me.

582
00:52:52,658 --> 00:53:01,245
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving forward, when the issue came forth during my presidency, he let us know about the meeting.

583
00:53:01,865 --> 00:53:03,586
[SPEAKER_09]: We circulated that to our membership.

584
00:53:03,967 --> 00:53:04,867
[SPEAKER_09]: And we attended the meeting.

585
00:53:04,907 --> 00:53:08,630
[SPEAKER_09]: I think you saw me sitting in the back over someone's shoulder.

586
00:53:08,650 --> 00:53:10,091
[SPEAKER_09]: But we attended the meeting.

587
00:53:11,179 --> 00:53:19,544
[SPEAKER_09]: After the meeting was had, he allowed me to obviously talk to him about what the business in the chamber felt.

588
00:53:20,485 --> 00:53:25,368
[SPEAKER_09]: We encouraged him to listen to what all the businesses were saying and act appropriately.

589
00:53:26,248 --> 00:53:37,795
[SPEAKER_09]: And he did that, and he called me this afternoon to say what he was about to do and how he took into account what the Chamber of Commerce, its members, and let's face it, not every business within the city of Medford

590
00:53:38,815 --> 00:53:40,295
[SPEAKER_09]: are members of the Chamber of Commerce.

591
00:53:40,655 --> 00:53:41,336
[SPEAKER_09]: I wish they were.

592
00:53:41,856 --> 00:53:44,736
[SPEAKER_09]: That would make a great presidency for me if I could grow it to that extent.

593
00:53:46,317 --> 00:53:55,379
[SPEAKER_09]: Nevertheless, I do believe the way to entice businesses to join the Chamber of Commerce is to show them what we as an organization do for businesses as a whole.

594
00:53:56,639 --> 00:54:04,481
[SPEAKER_09]: So I know that in taking our decision-making into account, we not only considered our members, but the businesses that are not yet members as a way to entice them.

595
00:54:05,581 --> 00:54:08,222
[SPEAKER_09]: So I know that when he told me the concessions he had made,

596
00:54:08,723 --> 00:54:14,305
[SPEAKER_09]: It said to me, as the President of the Chamber of Commerce, and quite frankly, as a business owner, I'm right in the thick of it.

597
00:54:14,665 --> 00:54:15,825
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm at zero governor's app.

598
00:54:16,745 --> 00:54:20,166
[SPEAKER_09]: I have real estate closings that go late because we can't find spaces.

599
00:54:20,506 --> 00:54:22,527
[SPEAKER_09]: So I understand from a practical level, too.

600
00:54:23,807 --> 00:54:24,867
[SPEAKER_09]: He took those concerns in.

601
00:54:25,548 --> 00:54:26,848
[SPEAKER_09]: He made a plan that'll work.

602
00:54:27,448 --> 00:54:33,730
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the satisfaction of everyone when you look at the overall plan, and that sums up the participation we've had in this process.

603
00:54:35,590 --> 00:54:37,351
[SPEAKER_06]: So just so I understand, if he was

604
00:54:37,810 --> 00:54:40,991
[SPEAKER_06]: The mayor was consulting with the past executive director.

605
00:54:41,772 --> 00:54:46,674
[SPEAKER_06]: Why were so many business owners caught off guard of what actually was in the proposal?

606
00:54:47,554 --> 00:55:02,241
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm not quite sure that I buy the fact that the chamber has had so much input in this proposal because the input really didn't take place until three and a half, four weeks ago.

607
00:55:03,309 --> 00:55:05,330
[SPEAKER_06]: And as you mentioned, this has been a process since 2009.

608
00:55:05,890 --> 00:55:08,931
[SPEAKER_06]: This has been an ongoing process for five years.

609
00:55:08,991 --> 00:55:21,436
[SPEAKER_06]: So I guess why all of a sudden in the last three weeks was it that the chamber was invited to the table to give input when supposedly there was open dialogue and input from

610
00:55:22,274 --> 00:55:23,915
[SPEAKER_06]: the chamber for the last five years.

611
00:55:23,935 --> 00:55:26,838
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't understand why he took such a direction.

612
00:55:27,298 --> 00:55:33,242
[SPEAKER_06]: If there was that much input for the last five years from the chamber, I would have think some of the issues would have been addressed.

613
00:55:33,843 --> 00:55:42,689
[SPEAKER_06]: And really, the issues that I hear from business owners weren't addressed, still really aren't addressed, but weren't really talked about until three weeks ago.

614
00:55:43,570 --> 00:55:47,353
[SPEAKER_09]: As far as why we got back into the process, we'll have to talk to the mayor about that.

615
00:55:47,373 --> 00:55:48,614
[SPEAKER_09]: Obviously, I didn't make that decision.

616
00:55:48,654 --> 00:55:50,475
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not in his head, so he'll have to answer that.

617
00:55:52,771 --> 00:55:58,713
[SPEAKER_09]: The businesses, I think, that are having a lot of issues inconsistent with the chamber aren't our members.

618
00:55:59,053 --> 00:55:59,894
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm very aware.

619
00:55:59,914 --> 00:56:03,055
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to speak specifically to the September meeting, because I was there.

620
00:56:03,795 --> 00:56:05,436
[SPEAKER_09]: I observed the meeting with all my senses.

621
00:56:06,056 --> 00:56:09,437
[SPEAKER_09]: The businesses that were the most vocal are not members of the Chamber of Commerce.

622
00:56:09,457 --> 00:56:12,538
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know which ones you're referring to.

623
00:56:13,099 --> 00:56:16,000
[SPEAKER_09]: The ones that were the most vocal at the meeting were not members of the Chamber of Commerce.

624
00:56:17,740 --> 00:56:19,901
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

625
00:56:20,061 --> 00:56:20,761
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't answer that.

626
00:56:20,822 --> 00:56:21,522
[SPEAKER_09]: You can answer that.

627
00:56:21,662 --> 00:56:22,042
[SPEAKER_09]: I just did.

628
00:56:22,352 --> 00:56:24,213
[SPEAKER_09]: the ones that are the most vocal aren't our members.

629
00:56:24,614 --> 00:56:26,755
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's the answer.

630
00:56:27,916 --> 00:56:28,597
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Penta.

631
00:56:28,617 --> 00:56:30,218
[SPEAKER_08]: I have four questions.

632
00:56:30,378 --> 00:56:34,281
[SPEAKER_08]: First of all, you said that they took your quote out of order.

633
00:56:34,301 --> 00:56:35,282
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm going to read this quote.

634
00:56:35,322 --> 00:56:36,683
[SPEAKER_08]: You tell me if it's accurate or not.

635
00:56:37,363 --> 00:56:42,567
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to let McGlynn quote, no, it's obvious to us that the different business districts have different needs.

636
00:56:42,687 --> 00:56:46,029
[SPEAKER_08]: White said, we're not going to advocate for any specific district.

637
00:56:46,390 --> 00:56:49,732
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to provide opportunities through us to get those voices heard.

638
00:56:49,752 --> 00:56:50,793
[SPEAKER_08]: True or false?

639
00:56:51,414 --> 00:56:52,555
[SPEAKER_09]: That one section is true.

640
00:56:53,015 --> 00:56:53,355
[SPEAKER_09]: It's true.

641
00:56:53,615 --> 00:56:54,416
[SPEAKER_09]: That one section.

642
00:56:54,736 --> 00:57:06,222
[SPEAKER_08]: So if that's true, and you're recognizing the different needs of the different areas, how can you go along and have one size fits all for all four districts?

643
00:57:06,503 --> 00:57:06,823
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't.

644
00:57:07,563 --> 00:57:08,984
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you have the whole article in front of you?

645
00:57:09,244 --> 00:57:09,404
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

646
00:57:09,664 --> 00:57:09,724
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

647
00:57:10,185 --> 00:57:12,446
[SPEAKER_09]: Read the very first sentence of the article after that line.

648
00:57:13,046 --> 00:57:14,067
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no quotes in it.

649
00:57:14,187 --> 00:57:15,628
[SPEAKER_09]: It's him saying what I said.

650
00:57:15,668 --> 00:57:17,109
[SPEAKER_09]: Read that sentence out loud, please.

651
00:57:17,190 --> 00:57:17,350
[SPEAKER_08]: Go ahead.

652
00:57:17,370 --> 00:57:18,811
[SPEAKER_09]: It says in West Method Square, for example?

653
00:57:18,831 --> 00:57:21,373
[SPEAKER_09]: No, the very first article in the very first sentence.

654
00:57:21,533 --> 00:57:27,378
[SPEAKER_11]: If I may, from the chair, we're not going to do the people's business based upon a newspaper article.

655
00:57:27,398 --> 00:57:30,020
[SPEAKER_11]: If you have specific questions for the chamber, all right.

656
00:57:30,321 --> 00:57:33,964
[SPEAKER_11]: Then ask your questions, and we're not going to go doing our business based upon it.

657
00:57:34,084 --> 00:57:35,525
[SPEAKER_08]: That's that part there.

658
00:57:36,446 --> 00:57:37,847
[SPEAKER_08]: You said the chamber supports this.

659
00:57:37,887 --> 00:57:38,848
[SPEAKER_08]: How many members in the chamber?

660
00:57:39,878 --> 00:57:43,299
[SPEAKER_09]: The present count to this very day, you want paying or not paying?

661
00:57:43,319 --> 00:57:46,741
[SPEAKER_09]: Because we have this dispute right now over who's a member and who's not.

662
00:57:46,761 --> 00:57:49,162
[SPEAKER_09]: Because some people say they are, they've applied, but they haven't paid.

663
00:57:50,042 --> 00:57:51,943
[SPEAKER_09]: So that number is with our executive director.

664
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:52,683
[SPEAKER_07]: Pardon me?

665
00:57:52,923 --> 00:57:54,584
[SPEAKER_09]: That number is with our executive director.

666
00:57:54,944 --> 00:57:59,846
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the numbers between 200 and 300, depending on who's paid and who is unpaid.

667
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:04,108
[SPEAKER_08]: So you have votes from the 200 plus members?

668
00:58:04,168 --> 00:58:04,208
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

669
00:58:04,868 --> 00:58:06,689
[SPEAKER_08]: So how does the chamber make a decision?

670
00:58:07,065 --> 00:58:07,765
[SPEAKER_08]: If you have membership.

671
00:58:07,906 --> 00:58:09,406
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a board of directors that leads the change.

672
00:58:09,427 --> 00:58:11,648
[SPEAKER_08]: So your board of directors made this vote, not the membership.

673
00:58:11,848 --> 00:58:12,909
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a board of directors.

674
00:58:12,929 --> 00:58:14,089
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a government affairs committee.

675
00:58:14,109 --> 00:58:15,310
[SPEAKER_09]: The government affairs committee met.

676
00:58:15,891 --> 00:58:16,411
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to finish.

677
00:58:16,891 --> 00:58:18,152
[SPEAKER_09]: The government affairs committee met.

678
00:58:18,992 --> 00:58:20,613
[SPEAKER_09]: We stated our position.

679
00:58:20,633 --> 00:58:22,935
[SPEAKER_09]: We brought it to the board and that's our position.

680
00:58:23,515 --> 00:58:23,755
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

681
00:58:24,196 --> 00:58:24,976
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's get this straight.

682
00:58:25,156 --> 00:58:26,537
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you a member of the chamber of commerce?

683
00:58:27,017 --> 00:58:27,418
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I'm not.

684
00:58:27,558 --> 00:58:27,898
[SPEAKER_09]: Why not?

685
00:58:28,342 --> 00:58:28,922
[SPEAKER_09]: Why should I be?

686
00:58:29,162 --> 00:58:30,083
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you a part of the community?

687
00:58:30,223 --> 00:58:33,124
[SPEAKER_07]: I, you know, something you just made a comment a minute ago.

688
00:58:33,424 --> 00:58:35,065
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you part of the gentleman please?

689
00:58:35,145 --> 00:58:35,665
[SPEAKER_07]: One at a time.

690
00:58:36,666 --> 00:58:38,486
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. White, you just made a comment a minute ago.

691
00:58:38,526 --> 00:58:47,530
[SPEAKER_11]: I have the, the council is going to have the floor and I'm just going to ask that we keep this civil for the purpose of moving the city forward.

692
00:58:48,291 --> 00:58:53,013
[SPEAKER_08]: You just made a comment at a minute ago that some of the people that are at that meeting on the 10th aren't members of the chamber.

693
00:58:53,053 --> 00:58:53,253
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

694
00:58:54,153 --> 00:58:56,274
[SPEAKER_08]: So because someone is not a member of the chamber,

695
00:58:57,096 --> 00:58:59,998
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not going to be looked upon with the same favor that somebody might be.

696
00:59:00,218 --> 00:59:02,019
[SPEAKER_08]: They're a business person in this community.

697
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:03,520
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not a question for me to answer.

698
00:59:03,581 --> 00:59:03,901
[SPEAKER_09]: Pardon me?

699
00:59:04,081 --> 00:59:05,442
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not a question for me to answer.

700
00:59:06,102 --> 00:59:07,163
[SPEAKER_09]: I represent my members.

701
00:59:08,804 --> 00:59:09,064
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

702
00:59:09,304 --> 00:59:10,245
[SPEAKER_08]: You represent your members.

703
00:59:10,625 --> 00:59:14,248
[SPEAKER_08]: And you also said that the business community was aware of that meeting on the 20th.

704
00:59:14,508 --> 00:59:14,728
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

705
00:59:14,828 --> 00:59:15,769
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean on the 10th.

706
00:59:15,829 --> 00:59:16,269
[SPEAKER_08]: Excuse me.

707
00:59:16,289 --> 00:59:16,489
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

708
00:59:16,710 --> 00:59:18,091
[SPEAKER_08]: At 117 in the afternoon.

709
00:59:18,131 --> 00:59:20,612
[SPEAKER_08]: That's when the emails went out.

710
00:59:20,632 --> 00:59:22,594
[SPEAKER_08]: 117 of the day of the meeting.

711
00:59:22,814 --> 00:59:25,876
[SPEAKER_08]: And a lot of people didn't even get it because they were still at work and not knowing it.

712
00:59:26,209 --> 00:59:31,031
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's not a well-advanced notice of people — of a public meeting regarding their living.

713
00:59:31,051 --> 00:59:31,312
[SPEAKER_08]: The President.

714
00:59:31,332 --> 00:59:33,633
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you saying the chamber member emails went out at 117 the day of the meeting?

715
00:59:33,653 --> 00:59:33,953
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Kudlow.

716
00:59:33,973 --> 00:59:34,613
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the meeting.

717
00:59:34,633 --> 00:59:34,893
[SPEAKER_09]: The President.

718
00:59:34,913 --> 00:59:35,674
[SPEAKER_09]: I will disagree with that.

719
00:59:35,694 --> 00:59:36,654
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Kudlow.

720
00:59:36,674 --> 00:59:40,936
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a public meeting that was advertised for more than 48 hours, according to state law.

721
00:59:40,957 --> 00:59:41,937
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Kudlow.

722
00:59:41,957 --> 00:59:53,643
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, Mr. President, I do want to get back to this thing that if Mr. White feels, on behalf of his membership, that this one-size-fits-all is going to address the concerns

723
00:59:54,167 --> 00:59:56,789
[SPEAKER_08]: of the five separate, the four squares and the downtown method.

724
00:59:57,949 --> 00:59:58,850
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd like to have you explain that.

725
00:59:59,370 --> 01:00:00,651
[SPEAKER_08]: How can this one size fits all?

726
01:00:02,392 --> 01:00:02,972
[SPEAKER_09]: How can it not?

727
01:00:03,472 --> 01:00:03,753
[SPEAKER_09]: Pardon me?

728
01:00:04,353 --> 01:00:10,176
[SPEAKER_09]: Would you like to install a parking program that is different in one part of the city and different in another part?

729
01:00:10,577 --> 01:00:14,379
[SPEAKER_09]: And how do you solve that problem when you have the other districts looking and saying, why do they get this?

730
01:00:14,839 --> 01:00:15,639
[SPEAKER_09]: Why do they get that?

731
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:16,820
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it was your call.

732
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:18,081
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Penta, I practice.

733
01:00:18,141 --> 01:00:18,661
[SPEAKER_07]: It was your call.

734
01:00:18,681 --> 01:00:19,842
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm still answering your question.

735
01:00:20,963 --> 01:00:23,404
[SPEAKER_09]: I practice law throughout the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

736
01:00:24,215 --> 01:00:36,979
[SPEAKER_09]: I spend most of my time in Salem, Massachusetts, at that registry, in Dedham, Massachusetts, at that registry, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, at that registry, Boston, Massachusetts, at the Suffolk registry.

737
01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:40,860
[SPEAKER_09]: I pay to park everywhere I go.

738
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:42,261
[SPEAKER_09]: I see all different kinds.

739
01:00:42,401 --> 01:00:48,543
[SPEAKER_09]: Kiosks, kiosks where you have to leave your stickers, meters, central pay stations.

740
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:55,964
[SPEAKER_09]: two-hour parking spots, one-hour parking spots, a half-an-hour parking spots, 15-minute spots.

741
01:00:58,446 --> 01:01:01,388
[SPEAKER_09]: If I'm running in somewhere, I may not put a quarter in.

742
01:01:01,549 --> 01:01:07,133
[SPEAKER_09]: What I can tell you is you can't do a program for each section of the city.

743
01:01:07,353 --> 01:01:10,356
[SPEAKER_09]: You're either going to pay to park, or you're not going to pay to park.

744
01:01:11,357 --> 01:01:13,278
[SPEAKER_08]: So then your quote in the paper was wrong.

745
01:01:13,779 --> 01:01:16,561
[SPEAKER_08]: You did not indicate that each part of the city is unique.

746
01:01:18,103 --> 01:01:21,586
[SPEAKER_09]: The position of the Chamber of Commerce is that we support parking.

747
01:01:21,886 --> 01:01:25,669
[SPEAKER_09]: We recognize in supporting that that our members have different needs.

748
01:01:26,229 --> 01:01:30,652
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not here as the president to advocate for each district, because they conflict with each other.

749
01:01:31,253 --> 01:01:34,475
[SPEAKER_09]: What someone in West Medford wants isn't what someone in Haines Square wants.

750
01:01:35,036 --> 01:01:44,102
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, I think we need to get a report back that are these four points recommendations, or are they actually part of the contract?

751
01:01:44,162 --> 01:01:47,485
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it's the mayor who uses the term, he's recommending changes.

752
01:01:48,430 --> 01:01:51,313
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't say it's not definitive, it's recommending.

753
01:01:52,334 --> 01:01:56,878
[SPEAKER_08]: And with that being said, with recommendations, I don't know if it's a contract or not.

754
01:01:57,758 --> 01:01:58,119
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

755
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:05,205
[SPEAKER_11]: I specifically asked that question, but I know you're not going to want to hear it from me, so I'll support you asking those questions to the mayor.

756
01:02:05,245 --> 01:02:09,969
[SPEAKER_11]: But it will be part of the binding contract of what the mayor said to me today.

757
01:02:10,170 --> 01:02:12,872
[SPEAKER_11]: But I have no problem asking him that in writing.

758
01:02:14,755 --> 01:02:18,658
[SPEAKER_11]: And thank you for carrying on your mom's legacy with our business community.

759
01:02:18,878 --> 01:02:20,920
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much for giving the opportunity to be heard again.

760
01:02:20,940 --> 01:02:25,664
[SPEAKER_09]: I apologize for the hoarseness and the Chamber of Commerce is always available.

761
01:02:26,064 --> 01:02:26,405
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

762
01:02:26,605 --> 01:02:30,608
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion of Councilor Penta that we get a, Councilor Dello Russo.

763
01:02:31,048 --> 01:02:43,799
[SPEAKER_02]: Could I amend the motion, whatever it may be, to include a request to the mayor's office to provide each member of the Medford City Council

764
01:02:44,261 --> 01:02:47,142
[SPEAKER_02]: with a copy of the signed document.

765
01:02:48,262 --> 01:02:55,103
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion, as amended by Councilor Penter, to ask the four questions if their recommendations are if they will be binding in the contract.

766
01:02:55,663 --> 01:03:01,564
[SPEAKER_11]: And the second amendment is from Councilor Dello Russo to furnish each member of the council a copy of the contract.

767
01:03:02,144 --> 01:03:06,865
[SPEAKER_11]: And in the interest of being environmentally friendly, do we prefer a certain way?

768
01:03:06,965 --> 01:03:11,466
[SPEAKER_11]: Because the last paperwork they sent us was on a CD, which was about over 100 pages long.

769
01:03:13,001 --> 01:03:15,203
[SPEAKER_02]: So is there a particular manner we'd like to get this?

770
01:03:15,823 --> 01:03:18,526
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd prefer paper rather than a petroleum-based product.

771
01:03:19,466 --> 01:03:19,767
[SPEAKER_11]: Paper.

772
01:03:20,207 --> 01:03:20,507
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

773
01:03:21,628 --> 01:03:27,573
[SPEAKER_11]: So why don't we let the city clerk know how we'd like it, because I'm sure certainly some of us would like it on electronic format.

774
01:03:28,314 --> 01:03:29,334
[SPEAKER_11]: Name and address for the record.

775
01:03:29,995 --> 01:03:32,517
[SPEAKER_10]: Joe Villione, 59 Garfield Avenue, Medford, Mass.

776
01:03:32,877 --> 01:03:33,598
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a question.

777
01:03:34,038 --> 01:03:40,844
[SPEAKER_10]: Does anyone know if city hall parking is going to be pay-to-park, and if we'll have to pay to pay our excise tax?

778
01:03:41,553 --> 01:03:44,834
[SPEAKER_10]: and pay to come here to the city council where I see four or five people tonight?

779
01:03:45,854 --> 01:03:55,856
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a very important question because this resident worked hard on taping a video for transparency in this city for people to see.

780
01:03:56,477 --> 01:04:05,439
[SPEAKER_10]: This council, regrettably, chose not to help me get it on the air, and now we have this, what this resident considers a travesty.

781
01:04:06,319 --> 01:04:11,140
[SPEAKER_10]: The businesses need to gather together, whether they're with the chamber or not,

782
01:04:11,741 --> 01:04:14,082
[SPEAKER_10]: and consider litigation against the city to stop this.

783
01:04:14,262 --> 01:04:18,005
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's the only thing that we can possibly do.

784
01:04:18,605 --> 01:04:21,106
[SPEAKER_10]: With all these problems in Medford, we're gonna have to start litigating.

785
01:04:22,847 --> 01:04:25,589
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion, as amended, all those in favor?

786
01:04:26,589 --> 01:04:27,730
[SPEAKER_11]: Roll call has been requested.

787
01:04:27,750 --> 01:04:28,571
[SPEAKER_11]: The clerk will call the roll.

788
01:04:32,473 --> 01:04:36,735
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll have a second polling of the membership to find out if they want it in electronic format.

789
01:04:36,775 --> 01:04:41,318
[SPEAKER_11]: The first question will be called to support the resolution as amended.

790
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:45,480
[SPEAKER_11]: Call the roll.

791
01:04:47,941 --> 01:04:48,802
[SPEAKER_12]: Vice President Caraviello.

792
01:04:48,842 --> 01:04:48,922
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

793
01:04:50,003 --> 01:04:50,863
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Dello Russo.

794
01:04:50,883 --> 01:04:51,423
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

795
01:04:51,443 --> 01:04:51,923
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Knight.

796
01:04:51,943 --> 01:04:52,004
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

797
01:04:52,724 --> 01:04:53,324
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor McKern.

798
01:04:53,364 --> 01:04:53,444
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

799
01:04:54,205 --> 01:04:54,705
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Marks.

800
01:04:54,725 --> 01:04:54,805
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

801
01:04:55,545 --> 01:04:56,046
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Penta.

802
01:04:56,066 --> 01:04:56,166
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

803
01:04:57,246 --> 01:04:57,907
[SPEAKER_12]: President Camuso.

804
01:04:58,247 --> 01:05:01,788
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, by a vote of seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

805
01:05:02,329 --> 01:05:10,113
[SPEAKER_11]: The second B paper now, we will simply ask if you want the copy of the contract in electronic format or on paper.

806
01:05:10,153 --> 01:05:11,393
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what the councilor asked.

807
01:05:16,072 --> 01:05:17,316
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll let the clerk know.

808
01:05:18,158 --> 01:05:21,286
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we'll let the clerk know.

809

832
01:07:52,028 --> 01:07:53,469
[SPEAKER_11]: Question, Councilor Prenta.

833
01:07:53,869 --> 01:07:55,911
[SPEAKER_08]: Clerk, do you have enough poll workers?

834
01:08:01,254 --> 01:08:05,077
[SPEAKER_12]: It's really hard to tell, but we usually fill the slots.

835
01:08:05,337 --> 01:08:07,619
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, you can't tell.

836
01:08:08,859 --> 01:08:12,942
[SPEAKER_12]: You can't tell up until, I hate to say, election morning sometime.

837
01:08:13,422 --> 01:08:15,104
[SPEAKER_12]: But right now, yeah.

838
01:08:15,344 --> 01:08:18,706
[SPEAKER_08]: During the last election, there was some concern over some of the ballot boxes not working.

839
01:08:19,147 --> 01:08:20,647
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there any of these?

840
01:08:21,188 --> 01:08:21,948
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a possibility.

841
01:08:22,988 --> 01:08:24,808
[SPEAKER_08]: But aren't these all checked out before?

842
01:08:25,169 --> 01:08:25,389
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah.

843
01:08:25,409 --> 01:08:25,569
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

844
01:08:25,889 --> 01:08:26,049
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

845
01:08:26,569 --> 01:08:37,552
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, you gotta, you gotta remember they're all checked prior, uh, but the transporting from city hall to the actual poll place itself, something that happened, come off the truck.

846
01:08:37,572 --> 01:08:43,313
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I think it, uh, uh, it's not the tabulating machine at the, that was wrong with it.

847
01:08:43,393 --> 01:08:46,334
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the, uh, black bar back with the velcro is in there.

848
01:08:46,854 --> 01:08:52,278
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a little arm that goes back and forth, and it got dislodged from Public Works, putting it down.

849
01:08:52,298 --> 01:08:54,559
[SPEAKER_12]: So it was just, you know, it was tabulating fine.

850
01:08:54,579 --> 01:08:56,101
[SPEAKER_12]: It was just a matter of, we got to replace the old.

851
01:08:56,121 --> 01:08:58,222
[SPEAKER_08]: Those all rechecked each and every election?

852
01:08:58,782 --> 01:08:59,503
[SPEAKER_08]: How does this work?

853
01:08:59,863 --> 01:09:01,624
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I have to do everything.

854
01:09:04,026 --> 01:09:10,511
[SPEAKER_12]: The week prior to that, I do all the machines, handicap and tabulated machines.

855
01:09:12,212 --> 01:09:16,655
[SPEAKER_08]: And for the sake of a public announcement, Mr. President, when can people start getting an absentee ballot?

856
01:09:18,702 --> 01:09:19,663
[SPEAKER_12]: This week, yeah.

857
01:09:20,063 --> 01:09:20,463
[SPEAKER_12]: This week?

858
01:09:20,503 --> 01:09:20,703
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

859
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:21,523
[SPEAKER_12]: As we speak.

[SPEAKER_11]: All set, councillor?

864
01:09:34,227 --> 01:09:34,387

871

[SPEAKER_02]: Motion, Mr. President, to suspend Rule 33 to take papers in the end.

872
01:09:50,519 --> 01:09:56,088
[SPEAKER_11]: We got one paper that has to do with the election, actually.

873
01:09:56,209 --> 01:09:56,569
[SPEAKER_11]: Take it now.

874
01:10:02,405 --> 01:10:30,424
[SPEAKER_11]: Right under suspension of rule number 33 offered by councillor Camuso be it resolved the Medford City Council cancer cancels the November 4th 2014 City Council meeting and that is for the state election in November 11th 2014 in observance of Veterans Day, which is on Tuesday this year, which usually is on a Monday All those in favor All those opposed the ayes have it offered by councillor Penta

01:10:45,051 --> 01:10:45,711
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Penta.

877
01:10:46,071 --> 01:11:00,014
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, Dorothy, as we all know, is our wonderful assistant in the clerk's office with Mr. Finn, and she works very hard through the years, and she's now being able to enjoy her grandchild, her son's first child, which would be her grandchild,

878
01:11:00,587 --> 01:11:01,708
[SPEAKER_08]: And we want to wish her the best.

879
01:11:03,069 --> 01:11:03,809
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor.

880
01:11:04,409 --> 01:11:05,170
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

01:11:07,911 --> 01:11:08,972
[SPEAKER_11]: Offered by Councilor Marks.

885
01:11:09,032 --> 01:11:16,976
[SPEAKER_11]: Be it resolved that the mayor provide the council a complete itemized list of money set aside for Dog Park, including who donated the money and when.

886
01:11:17,337 --> 01:11:17,917
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Marks.

887
01:11:18,717 --> 01:11:19,778
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

888
01:11:20,879 --> 01:11:28,583
[SPEAKER_06]: For those that are not aware, there are many petitions circulating the community right now for support.

889
01:11:29,028 --> 01:11:31,430
[SPEAKER_06]: of a dog park in this community.

890
01:11:32,331 --> 01:11:42,959
[SPEAKER_06]: We were promised back in 2011 by the mayor that he was going to implement a dog park somewhere within our community.

891
01:11:43,719 --> 01:11:53,446
[SPEAKER_06]: And I am asking now for a complete itemization of the money that the mayor supposedly accepted from J.F.

892
01:11:53,506 --> 01:11:56,789
[SPEAKER_06]: White bridge construction, which was mitigation money.

893
01:11:57,578 --> 01:11:58,298
[SPEAKER_06]: back in, I believe, 2012.

894
01:11:58,939 --> 01:12:06,801
[SPEAKER_06]: And also, September 2010 was the Meffitt Jingle Bell Committee.

895
01:12:07,141 --> 01:12:10,142
[SPEAKER_06]: They had a dog show and raised money for the dog park.

896
01:12:10,942 --> 01:12:16,104
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, the Doggie Fun Run at Hormel Stadium, which was in 2013 and just recently held in 2014.

897
01:12:19,774 --> 01:12:28,120
[SPEAKER_06]: 14, and also the Boston Volunteer Solutions Incorporated donated $1,766 to develop a dog park.

898
01:12:28,881 --> 01:12:41,510
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would like a complete itemized list of the different groups and organizations that have donated the money, when it was donated, and how much is in that account as it currently exists, Mr. President.

899
01:12:42,631 --> 01:12:44,412
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion of Councilor Marks, Councilor Knight.

900
01:12:45,073 --> 01:12:46,374
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much, Mr. President.

901
01:12:46,860 --> 01:12:52,463
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's very important that we recognize the efforts and the leadership that Councilman Marks has put forward on the issue of a dog park.

902
01:12:53,064 --> 01:12:56,846
[SPEAKER_03]: Not only has he brought this issue to the council floor, he's actually put his money where his mouth is.

903
01:12:56,886 --> 01:13:04,310
[SPEAKER_03]: He's gone out, I witnessed him personally collecting signatures from members in this community to seek support for a dog park, Mr. President.

904
01:13:04,750 --> 01:13:12,655
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the proactive grassroots type of work that makes the community really come together and it makes matters like this come to fruition.

905
01:13:13,625 --> 01:13:16,846
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to congratulate Councilor Marks on the efforts that he's put forward, Mr. President.

906
01:13:16,886 --> 01:13:19,047
[SPEAKER_03]: Not only does he file the resolutions, but he does the legwork.

907
01:13:20,287 --> 01:13:21,688
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, and thank you, Councilor Marks.

908
01:13:23,628 --> 01:13:26,389
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Marks, on your recognition.

909
01:13:26,409 --> 01:13:29,990
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to thank my council colleague, Councilor Knight, for those kind words.

910
01:13:30,550 --> 01:13:42,474
[SPEAKER_06]: And, Mr. President, you know, I recognize, and I think many people behind this reeling, because we've all supported it, the fact that there's a need in this community, the fact that we have space in this community,

911
01:13:42,964 --> 01:13:46,045
[SPEAKER_06]: The fact that money's been raised in this community, Mr. President.

912
01:13:46,485 --> 01:13:50,266
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think all three combine to a reason why we need this park.

913
01:13:50,947 --> 01:13:57,929
[SPEAKER_06]: And I, as one person, believe that we can no longer wait for this in our community.

914
01:13:58,249 --> 01:13:59,869
[SPEAKER_06]: It was promised back three years ago.

915
01:14:00,250 --> 01:14:03,351
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a great way to exercise, socialize your dog.

916
01:14:03,771 --> 01:14:04,531
[SPEAKER_06]: People meet.

917
01:14:04,551 --> 01:14:09,212
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, Somerville last year licensed over 7,000 dogs.

918
01:14:11,621 --> 01:14:12,182
[SPEAKER_06]: in Somerville.

919
01:14:12,622 --> 01:14:15,766
[SPEAKER_06]: Method licensed, I believe it was about 425, 400 dogs in this community.

920
01:14:15,826 --> 01:14:19,310
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think it shows you, Mr. President,

921
01:14:23,848 --> 01:14:36,979
[SPEAKER_06]: When you have a community that has support for a dog park, support for initiatives like that, that people come out, they'll license their dogs, they'll get active, and that's healthy in a community.

922
01:14:37,559 --> 01:14:52,332
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think other surrounding communities that do have dog parks, Melrose, Somerville, Cambridge, Boston, Brookline, Arlington, Malden, Billerica, that have dog parks experience this, and our residents, I believe, are losing out on this experience as well as

923
01:14:53,134 --> 01:14:55,997
[SPEAKER_06]: the need to exercise their dogs, Mr. President.

924
01:14:56,757 --> 01:14:58,939
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn and then Councilor Dello Russo.

925
01:14:59,380 --> 01:15:00,801
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, President Camuso.

926
01:15:00,901 --> 01:15:03,003
[SPEAKER_00]: I echo the sentiment of my councilors.

927
01:15:03,063 --> 01:15:11,531
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe a dog park, and I've said it before, is needed in this community, especially since we've raised money and had fundraisers for it, and there's money sitting there.

928
01:15:12,812 --> 01:15:13,773
[SPEAKER_00]: I did have a question.

929
01:15:13,813 --> 01:15:16,135
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that there's petitions going around.

930
01:15:16,175 --> 01:15:19,078
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw that SMARTO, the South Medford

931
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:24,362
[SPEAKER_00]: neighborhood group has sent petitions out, so I ask Councilor Marks, are they going to be in any businesses?

932
01:15:24,442 --> 01:15:26,983
[SPEAKER_00]: Where can people go to sign a petition?

933
01:15:27,003 --> 01:15:36,986
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we should, I know you're working on the petition, but how can people get out that you really don't know, aren't in the SMARTO email list?

934
01:15:37,086 --> 01:15:39,347
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we get the people out to sign petitions?

935
01:15:39,367 --> 01:15:40,907
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a good question.

936
01:15:42,248 --> 01:15:48,130
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyone interested in passing out petitions or putting them in businesses can contact myself.

937
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:52,881
[SPEAKER_06]: or, you know, maybe do it collectively.

938
01:15:52,921 --> 01:15:53,801
[SPEAKER_06]: Any counselor, right?

939
01:15:53,981 --> 01:15:54,161
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

940
01:15:54,181 --> 01:16:05,904
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you know, we're, we're trying to organize and like Council Knight said, it's grassroots and it's very difficult to get the list of, we did get a list of everyone that pulled the dog license.

941
01:16:06,704 --> 01:16:17,147
[SPEAKER_06]: We're in the process of trying to contact people and eventually where the hopes are, Mr. President, that we're going to present all these petitions on a dog rally here at city hall.

942
01:16:18,061 --> 01:16:35,045
[SPEAKER_06]: And hopefully we'll have enough interest and enough participation to show the mayor that this is something, and I think the mayor agrees, but he's working slowly on it, that there's a need out there, and the need is eminent, and there's no reason to wait.

943
01:16:36,145 --> 01:16:36,505
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

944
01:16:36,745 --> 01:16:37,065
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

945
01:16:38,246 --> 01:16:39,046
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Dello Russo.

946
01:16:39,508 --> 01:16:42,470
[SPEAKER_02]: I was in Boston this afternoon on business.

947
01:16:42,750 --> 01:16:45,852
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a meeting on Washington Street in the south end.

948
01:16:47,813 --> 01:16:56,619
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a park there, a dog park, right there on Washington Street, just between where the Herald was and where the cathedral is.

949
01:16:56,959 --> 01:17:02,543
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a little dog park that's not much bigger than the area behind this rail.

950
01:17:03,977 --> 01:17:13,365
[SPEAKER_02]: Simple, clean, place for people to gather, let the dogs run around, play, intermingle, do whatever it is that they do, and you go home.

951
01:17:13,885 --> 01:17:15,126
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very simple thing.

952
01:17:15,266 --> 01:17:16,447
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not elaborate.

953
01:17:16,948 --> 01:17:21,411
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't have Carrara marble colonnades.

954
01:17:21,812 --> 01:17:23,073
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a chain link fence.

955
01:17:23,653 --> 01:17:25,235
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got the gravel that it needs.

956
01:17:25,315 --> 01:17:27,797
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got water spigots for the dogs to drink out of.

957
01:17:28,177 --> 01:17:28,778
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's it.

958
01:17:29,078 --> 01:17:29,959
[SPEAKER_02]: And a couple benches.

959
01:17:30,379 --> 01:17:31,039
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's that?

960
01:17:33,636 --> 01:17:34,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Refuse bags.

961
01:17:35,598 --> 01:17:36,138
[SPEAKER_02]: Very nice.

962
01:17:38,300 --> 01:17:38,620
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

963
01:17:38,700 --> 01:17:39,361
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Penta.

964
01:17:40,482 --> 01:17:43,985
[SPEAKER_11]: And then Vice President Caraviello.

965
01:17:45,085 --> 01:17:51,531
[SPEAKER_08]: The only problem with the dog park has been the mayor is telling everyone it's going to cost $200,000 and he's telling people to go out and do it.

966
01:17:52,391 --> 01:17:56,255
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I mean, how do you turn around and tell the people you go out and get the dog park?

967
01:17:56,935 --> 01:18:00,278
[SPEAKER_08]: And as Councilor Marks alluded to before, you know, RF Whiting Company,

968
01:18:00,720 --> 01:18:03,461
[SPEAKER_08]: according to the mayor, was supposed to give the money for the dog park, and they never did.

969
01:18:04,162 --> 01:18:09,124
[SPEAKER_08]: And now he's telling the people, you've got to raise the $200,000 if you really want this dog park.

970
01:18:09,904 --> 01:18:11,625
[SPEAKER_08]: He knows how to raise money for everything else.

971
01:18:13,426 --> 01:18:15,007
[SPEAKER_08]: It's amazing.

972
01:18:15,047 --> 01:18:29,354
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think the good part is maybe, Mr. Clerk, if we have just a single number they can call the clerk's office, and maybe you should have a stack of petitions there if people come in, because that's where the licenses are as well, too, to pick up a license in your office.

973
01:18:30,845 --> 01:18:32,186
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't generate the petitions.

974
01:18:32,306 --> 01:18:32,746
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, no.

975
01:18:33,427 --> 01:18:39,270
[SPEAKER_08]: If petitions are left in your office, if petitions are left in your office and somebody wants to come and pick them up, they can pick them up.

976
01:18:39,731 --> 01:18:42,152
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that may be a good idea.

977
01:18:43,553 --> 01:18:44,434
[SPEAKER_08]: Central point in the building.

978
01:18:45,194 --> 01:18:46,475
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice President Caraviello.

979
01:18:46,955 --> 01:18:47,716
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

980
01:18:48,096 --> 01:18:58,382
[SPEAKER_05]: The dog park that Councilor De La Rosa mentions, I was there with Maria Menounos when that opened with the grants from Purina Dog Food.

981
01:19:00,669 --> 01:19:02,230
[SPEAKER_05]: So there is somebody out there for those things.

982
01:19:04,771 --> 01:19:05,912
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

983
01:19:05,992 --> 01:19:09,574
[SPEAKER_11]: And thank you for your dogged work on this, Councilor Marks.

984
01:19:13,937 --> 01:19:18,340
[SPEAKER_11]: Move on the motion of approval by Councilor Dello Russo, seconded by Councilor Marks.

985
01:19:18,380 --> 01:19:20,361
[SPEAKER_11]: A roll call vote has been requested.

986
01:19:22,583 --> 01:19:27,246
[SPEAKER_11]: Further amended that the petitions be available in the clerk's office for anyone that would like to sign them.

987
01:19:29,042 --> 01:19:31,422
[SPEAKER_11]: copies of them, to grab a copy.

988
01:19:31,822 --> 01:19:35,103
[SPEAKER_12]: Someone can bring them in, put them on the table.

989
01:19:35,463 --> 01:19:36,863
[SPEAKER_12]: I just can't generate them.

990
01:19:37,363 --> 01:19:37,664
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't.

991
01:19:37,744 --> 01:19:40,164
[SPEAKER_12]: You can't use public resources for private.

992
01:19:41,264 --> 01:19:42,984
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

993
01:19:43,224 --> 01:19:43,445
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

994
01:19:45,345 --> 01:19:46,105
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Dello Russo.

995
01:19:46,125 --> 01:19:46,185
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

996
01:19:46,905 --> 01:19:47,365
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Knight.

997
01:19:47,385 --> 01:19:47,445
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

998
01:19:48,425 --> 01:19:49,085
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor McCurran.

999
01:19:49,105 --> 01:19:49,166
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1000
01:19:49,926 --> 01:19:50,506
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Marks.

1001
01:19:50,806 --> 01:19:51,066
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1002
01:19:51,386 --> 01:19:51,966
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Penta.

1003
01:19:51,986 --> 01:19:52,066
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1004
01:19:52,846 --> 01:19:53,486
[SPEAKER_11]: President Camuso.

1005
01:19:53,746 --> 01:19:54,006
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1006
01:19:54,086 --> 01:19:57,407
[SPEAKER_11]: By a vote of seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

1007
01:19:58,624 --> 01:20:02,026
[SPEAKER_11]: offered by Councilor Penta, item 14-690.

1008
01:20:02,266 --> 01:20:05,989
[SPEAKER_11]: Be it resolved that the newly imposed water rate increases be discussed.

1009
01:20:06,389 --> 01:20:07,049
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Penta.

1010
01:20:07,910 --> 01:20:12,853
[SPEAKER_08]: President, yesterday, well, I think it was yesterday.

1011
01:20:12,873 --> 01:20:13,713
[SPEAKER_08]: I got mine yesterday.

1012
01:20:13,733 --> 01:20:15,074
[SPEAKER_08]: Other people may have got it the day before.

1013
01:20:15,754 --> 01:20:26,101
[SPEAKER_08]: We all received in the mail our new water bill, and we also received a letter from the city indicating to the city of Medford water and sewer customers.

1014
01:20:26,601 --> 01:20:28,242
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, the letter is undated,

1015
01:20:29,036 --> 01:20:36,698
[SPEAKER_08]: right there in and of itself tends to indicate a lack of professionalism in the letter going out.

1016
01:20:37,779 --> 01:20:43,220
[SPEAKER_08]: There was no notice of a public meeting or an agenda item on this particular matter.

1017
01:20:43,801 --> 01:20:58,245
[SPEAKER_08]: The Medford City Council not only has talked about it, but at our April meeting of this year, we had a resolution that was offered by myself and passed by the seven members of the council to have the cemetery, no, excuse me,

1018
01:20:58,663 --> 01:21:08,471
[SPEAKER_08]: The Water and Soil Commission has appeared before the council and to explain this new idea of tiered rates and commercial rates or whatever it might be and however it's going to take place.

1019
01:21:09,312 --> 01:21:10,372
[SPEAKER_08]: And that passed.

1020
01:21:10,793 --> 01:21:15,737
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunately, the mayor sends an answer back and says it's the council's purview.

1021
01:21:16,618 --> 01:21:20,901
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's the Water and Soil Commission's purview to make that decision, number one.

1022
01:21:21,141 --> 01:21:28,387
[SPEAKER_08]: And number two, this is a matter that involves the entire city for the purposes of being involved and getting involved.

1023
01:21:29,346 --> 01:21:33,409
[SPEAKER_08]: The council has asked on numerous occasions for the Water and Soil Commission.

1024
01:21:33,609 --> 01:21:36,592
[SPEAKER_08]: I personally have met with the chairman of the Water and Soil Commission.

1025
01:21:37,272 --> 01:21:38,333
[SPEAKER_08]: I asked him to come here.

1026
01:21:38,353 --> 01:21:41,356
[SPEAKER_08]: We're still waiting for him to come here.

1027
01:21:41,376 --> 01:21:46,400
[SPEAKER_08]: The mayor has never offered a public meeting or a hearing on this particular increase.

1028
01:21:47,220 --> 01:21:51,003
[SPEAKER_08]: So there is a complete lack of public education on this increase.

1029
01:21:51,664 --> 01:21:55,267
[SPEAKER_08]: And as a result of this, we have problems here.

1030
01:21:56,408 --> 01:21:59,010
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at your bill that just came out, and it talks about

1031
01:22:00,526 --> 01:22:05,390
[SPEAKER_08]: The rates only apply to homes with up to four families and residential condo buildings.

1032
01:22:06,050 --> 01:22:09,453
[SPEAKER_08]: And then it gives you a 0 to 800 as a base.

1033
01:22:09,493 --> 01:22:11,674
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't know where they got that 800 as being the base.

1034
01:22:12,215 --> 01:22:13,736
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, no determination from that.

1035
01:22:14,196 --> 01:22:18,560
[SPEAKER_08]: And then from 800 cubic feet to 1,600 feet, you get to another rate.

1036
01:22:18,620 --> 01:22:19,480
[SPEAKER_08]: And it goes on.

1037
01:22:19,540 --> 01:22:21,202
[SPEAKER_08]: And after that, there's a third rate.

1038
01:22:21,222 --> 01:22:25,645
[SPEAKER_08]: So as a residential owner, you could have up to three types of rates in your particular house.

1039
01:22:26,646 --> 01:22:28,447
[SPEAKER_08]: And then it goes down further to indicate

1040
01:22:29,122 --> 01:22:34,085
[SPEAKER_08]: Every other person or every other type of an account will be charged 0.138.

1041
01:22:34,786 --> 01:22:38,888
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, does that mean that that's going to be a commercial rate?

1042
01:22:40,309 --> 01:22:47,093
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought we were led to believe that there was going to be allegedly a commercial rate, which would be different than the regular rate.

1043
01:22:47,853 --> 01:22:52,776
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you go back to the first paragraph, they talk about they're adopting this in response to Chapter 165, Section 2B.

1044
01:22:52,836 --> 01:22:55,458
[SPEAKER_08]: And 165, Section 2B is very explicit

1045
01:22:59,343 --> 01:23:20,895
[SPEAKER_08]: where it talks about, shall institute water charges and fees that incorporate a base rate for all, provided, which means other than or maybe, that said base rate shall be increased at an increased block rate to fairly reflect the resource demand and consumption of high volume uses of water.

1046
01:23:22,576 --> 01:23:25,378
[SPEAKER_08]: Now think about high volume uses of water.

1047
01:23:27,475 --> 01:23:34,021
[SPEAKER_08]: If you live in a three-family house, for the example that they use, you are a single person on the first floor.

1048
01:23:34,861 --> 01:23:38,584
[SPEAKER_08]: There is two, three people on the third floor, five or six people on the third floor.

1049
01:23:39,425 --> 01:23:43,048
[SPEAKER_08]: And they use the example you used, 2,100 units of water.

1050
01:23:43,068 --> 01:23:50,555
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they're going to take the 2,100 units of water, divide it by three, and everybody's going to be tagged with 700 units of water to be charged.

1051
01:23:51,936 --> 01:23:55,359
[SPEAKER_08]: That doesn't make any sense at all, number one, because number one,

1052
01:23:56,306 --> 01:23:57,906
[SPEAKER_08]: Not everybody has a meter in their apartment.

1053
01:23:58,346 --> 01:24:03,127
[SPEAKER_08]: And if it's a single meter that's going to cover the whole house, some houses are like that.

1054
01:24:03,948 --> 01:24:06,108
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, how do you distribute that?

1055
01:24:06,508 --> 01:24:10,109
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, where they come up with this, I have absolutely no idea.

1056
01:24:10,969 --> 01:24:16,250
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is what prompted probably eight or nine of my 13 calls that I've already received so far in this.

1057
01:24:16,650 --> 01:24:18,271
[SPEAKER_08]: How do they make this type of a determination?

1058
01:24:18,751 --> 01:24:24,092
[SPEAKER_08]: But more importantly, personally, I think this is the mayor's way of retaliating against the council.

1059
01:24:24,619 --> 01:24:27,241
[SPEAKER_08]: because we didn't give him his $600,000 in the budget.

1060
01:24:27,981 --> 01:24:29,663
[SPEAKER_08]: Bad enough we didn't give him his parking garage.

1061
01:24:30,103 --> 01:24:36,407
[SPEAKER_08]: And as a result of that, this rate increase not only will pick up the $600,000, it'll probably exceed that.

1062
01:24:37,168 --> 01:24:39,550
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely, absolutely not fair.

1063
01:24:40,150 --> 01:24:40,870
[SPEAKER_08]: It is not right.

1064
01:24:41,751 --> 01:24:50,737
[SPEAKER_08]: At the present time, people should be aware of the fact, at the present time, in our water and sewer retained earnings account, we have $8,400,000 as of today.

1065
01:24:56,533 --> 01:25:06,741
[SPEAKER_08]: $8,400,000.

1066
01:24:58,275 --> 01:25:06,741
[SPEAKER_08]: We would have $9,600,000 if we didn't take a million two a few years ago to take the mayor out of his deficit hole because he couldn't balance the budget.

1067
01:25:07,762 --> 01:25:12,645
[SPEAKER_08]: But with that being said, $8 million, that's a lot of money.

1068
01:25:13,366 --> 01:25:16,828
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're talking about rate payers having to be charged right now.

1069
01:25:17,549 --> 01:25:21,692
[SPEAKER_08]: There is nothing in this letter that would even give you an assumption

1070
01:25:22,301 --> 01:25:25,523
[SPEAKER_08]: that it's going to take place next year, or the next billing cycle.

1071
01:25:25,963 --> 01:25:29,705
[SPEAKER_08]: They just jam it in the letter, and there it is in your new bill.

1072
01:25:31,046 --> 01:25:44,354
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, I went back, and to my knowledge, the last time in billing cycles in 2006, as compared to the bills that we have right now, the 2006 bill, sixth bill, tells you

1073
01:25:44,895 --> 01:25:48,777
[SPEAKER_08]: The cost, it breaks it down for water and sewer, the cost.

1074
01:25:49,277 --> 01:25:54,380
[SPEAKER_08]: Your water and sewer cost is not broken down in these blue bills that we've been getting for a long period of time.

1075
01:25:55,381 --> 01:26:12,710
[SPEAKER_08]: And as a result of that, I'm going to suggest in part, Mr. President, that the city's water and sewer department and the city of Medford building department reinstitute the prior building process that not only showed the prior readings, the present readings, the usage,

1076
01:26:13,311 --> 01:26:17,474
[SPEAKER_08]: but the rates for water and the rates for sewer per 100 cubic feet.

1077
01:26:17,955 --> 01:26:26,261
[SPEAKER_08]: So the people have an informed, knowledgeable bill, rather than getting a dollar amount and trying to figure out the hocus pocus that's going on.

1078
01:26:27,281 --> 01:26:29,823
[SPEAKER_08]: Baseline water usage of 800, where do they get that?

1079
01:26:30,484 --> 01:26:35,087
[SPEAKER_08]: I have absolutely no idea who determined, and they don't even tell you where it came from.

1080
01:26:37,089 --> 01:26:39,871
[SPEAKER_08]: The bill, as I said before, it doesn't ID the water and sewer rates.

1081
01:26:40,435 --> 01:26:42,917
[SPEAKER_08]: But back and prior to 2006, it did.

1082
01:26:42,977 --> 01:26:47,060
[SPEAKER_08]: It gives you everything that you would want to know to try to figure out your bill.

1083
01:26:48,221 --> 01:26:54,727
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, your old rate consumption as compared to your new rate consumption, that's another thing that's not on here.

1084
01:26:54,767 --> 01:27:04,955
[SPEAKER_08]: Because all they're doing and they're telling you on the blue bill, it's just telling you what you had last time, what the reading was, and the amount.

1085
01:27:06,276 --> 01:27:09,839
[SPEAKER_08]: And once again, what's water, what's sewer, I don't know.

1086
01:27:12,566 --> 01:27:17,210
[SPEAKER_08]: I think what really needs to be done on this particular issue is two things.

1087
01:27:17,550 --> 01:27:21,913
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't send out bills to people and just tell them it becomes effective now.

1088
01:27:23,555 --> 01:27:24,255
[SPEAKER_08]: That's number one.

1089
01:27:24,315 --> 01:27:26,837
[SPEAKER_08]: Number two, you don't send out a letter that's undated.

1090
01:27:27,197 --> 01:27:36,745
[SPEAKER_08]: Number three, you don't turn around and tell, for an example, a three-family house, you're going to split it between the three floors, and everyone's going to pay the same amount on a per-unit charge.

1091
01:27:36,965 --> 01:27:37,726
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't do that.

1092
01:27:38,806 --> 01:27:40,608
[SPEAKER_08]: Second of all, there's nothing on this bill

1093
01:27:41,719 --> 01:27:45,181
[SPEAKER_08]: on this letter that talks about a commercial rate.

1094
01:27:46,141 --> 01:27:47,521
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think Councilor Marks, is he here?

1095
01:27:48,382 --> 01:27:51,423
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there was an issue relative to a commercial rate before.

1096
01:27:51,543 --> 01:27:52,964
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, where are we going with that?

1097
01:27:53,664 --> 01:27:55,565
[SPEAKER_08]: It says all other rates will be 0.1381.

1098
01:27:55,925 --> 01:28:04,869
[SPEAKER_08]: And that will be the same rate as someone who goes from the 800 to the 1600 level in a residential home.

1099
01:28:05,829 --> 01:28:07,210
[SPEAKER_08]: I said it before and I'll say it again.

1100
01:28:07,970 --> 01:28:10,751
[SPEAKER_08]: If families are going to be penalized because they have

1101
01:28:11,272 --> 01:28:15,055
[SPEAKER_08]: children or mothers and fathers or seniors living with them.

1102
01:28:15,695 --> 01:28:16,435
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not fair.

1103
01:28:17,036 --> 01:28:18,057
[SPEAKER_08]: It's absolutely not fair.

1104
01:28:18,497 --> 01:28:25,261
[SPEAKER_08]: And as the law says, the resources should go on the demand and the consumption of high volume uses of water.

1105
01:28:27,063 --> 01:28:34,027
[SPEAKER_08]: A residential home, maybe just over this 800 level or whatever it might be, those aren't high uses of water.

1106
01:28:34,828 --> 01:28:36,389
[SPEAKER_08]: That's baseline wherever they got it.

1107
01:28:37,089 --> 01:28:37,790
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe the zero to 800.

1108
01:28:38,769 --> 01:28:43,131
[SPEAKER_08]: should be maybe the $0 to $1,200 or $1,400, and then change it after that.

1109
01:28:43,911 --> 01:28:47,392
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I don't think it's bad enough rate payers, you're hitting them with a federal tax.

1110
01:28:47,672 --> 01:28:48,753
[SPEAKER_08]: You hit them with your state tax.

1111
01:28:49,013 --> 01:28:50,013
[SPEAKER_08]: You hit them with a meals tax.

1112
01:28:50,033 --> 01:28:51,373
[SPEAKER_08]: You're hitting them with a gas tax.

1113
01:28:51,614 --> 01:28:53,214
[SPEAKER_08]: You hit them with your real estate tax.

1114
01:28:53,494 --> 01:29:00,897
[SPEAKER_08]: And now you want to raise their water and sewer tax with an $8.4 million surplus sitting in a kitty.

1115
01:29:01,717 --> 01:29:02,317
[SPEAKER_08]: It's wrong.

1116
01:29:03,358 --> 01:29:05,298
[SPEAKER_08]: This is not what the council asked for.

1117
01:29:05,318 --> 01:29:07,119
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe this is the mayor's

1118
01:29:07,443 --> 01:29:16,910
[SPEAKER_08]: way of getting back at the council because $600,000 was taken out of the budget for which the council voted for to knock off the 10% rate increase?

1119
01:29:17,691 --> 01:29:23,775
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, this rate increase is definitely going to exceed the 10% that the mayor was losing, or the $600,000.

1120
01:29:24,436 --> 01:29:26,337
[SPEAKER_08]: And who's going to pay for it?

1121
01:29:26,638 --> 01:29:27,758
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the everyday person.

1122
01:29:28,779 --> 01:29:36,345
[SPEAKER_08]: I would strongly suggest, Mr. President, once again, as we did in August, if the mayor says this is within the purview of the council,

1123
01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:49,322
[SPEAKER_08]: Then let it be in the purview and strike that respectfully request that the Board of Commissioners appear before the Medford City Council for the purposes of explaining not only the letter, but the rates as to where we're going.

1124
01:29:49,863 --> 01:30:00,165
[SPEAKER_08]: And also respectfully request that they change their billing process to accurately show the rate for water, the rate for sewer, where it's going, and the amount.

1125
01:30:00,945 --> 01:30:02,565
[SPEAKER_08]: Now with that being said, Mr. President,

1126
01:30:03,911 --> 01:30:05,792
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't find anyone, and I'm still waiting.

1127
01:30:05,872 --> 01:30:11,293
[SPEAKER_08]: I had a long talk today with Mr. Remsburg, who was the chief legal counsel for the MWRA.

1128
01:30:11,994 --> 01:30:21,316
[SPEAKER_08]: And in my conversation with him, which represented the same type of conversation I had with him in August of this past year, we're back to the same issue for which I believe we're on the same page.

1129
01:30:22,577 --> 01:30:33,120
[SPEAKER_08]: The bigger users, the demand for bigger users and demand for more consumption and high volume of users of water should be the first ones, according to this chapter of the law, to be paid.

1130
01:30:33,882 --> 01:30:49,473
[SPEAKER_08]: It says, all municipalities and water districts within the jurisdiction of the MWRA, but not including community service by the Connecticut Valley Aqueduct, shall institute water charges and fees that incorporate a base rate for all users.

1131
01:30:50,174 --> 01:30:50,554
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay?

1132
01:30:50,854 --> 01:30:52,355
[SPEAKER_08]: They're saying 800 is the base rate.

1133
01:30:53,176 --> 01:31:01,442
[SPEAKER_08]: But it says, provided that said base rate shall be increased at an increasing block rate to fairly recollect

1134
01:31:01,909 --> 01:31:06,611
[SPEAKER_08]: the resources, demand, and consumption of high-volume uses of water.

1135
01:31:07,072 --> 01:31:11,374
[SPEAKER_08]: If somebody is 801, is they going to be tagged as a high-volume use of water?

1136
01:31:12,074 --> 01:31:21,999
[SPEAKER_08]: Because that person at 801, which could be residential, is going to be tagged at the same amount that everyone else is going to be tagged that's not residential.

1137
01:31:22,059 --> 01:31:24,681
[SPEAKER_08]: And you're going to have to assume it's commercial, because they don't say it.

1138
01:31:24,741 --> 01:31:26,942
[SPEAKER_08]: But what is it?

1139
01:31:27,082 --> 01:31:28,442
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody else but residential.

1140
01:31:28,703 --> 01:31:29,583
[SPEAKER_08]: It's got to be commercial.

1141
01:31:30,463 --> 01:31:31,484
[SPEAKER_08]: So with that being said,

1142
01:31:32,191 --> 01:31:33,652
[SPEAKER_08]: I think this needs to be addressed.

1143
01:31:34,312 --> 01:31:36,074
[SPEAKER_08]: I think somebody needs to be here to address it.

1144
01:31:36,474 --> 01:31:37,935
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the billing needs to be addressed.

1145
01:31:38,215 --> 01:31:50,703
[SPEAKER_08]: And more importantly, I think it's absolutely unfair that somebody would put a, an increase in your bill on the same time that goes out with no public education, no public notice.

1146
01:31:51,223 --> 01:31:54,065
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, this is three strikes that the mayor has given to us.

1147
01:31:55,926 --> 01:32:01,029
[SPEAKER_08]: He's taking money away from people on cable access on Verizon and Comcast bills.

1148
01:32:01,547 --> 01:32:02,247
[SPEAKER_08]: He's sitting on $303,000.

1149
01:32:02,448 --> 01:32:04,789
[SPEAKER_08]: It's sitting downstairs.

1150
01:32:05,489 --> 01:32:14,594
[SPEAKER_08]: He just now signs, he just now signs a pay to park program that didn't have one public hearing here for the taxpayers to talk about and discuss.

1151
01:32:14,955 --> 01:32:24,900
[SPEAKER_08]: And thirdly, he's now hitting you with a new tax on your water and sewer charge with no public input, no public information, no public hearing or anything.

1152
01:32:25,340 --> 01:32:28,202
[SPEAKER_08]: That's three strikes since the summer of this year.

1153
01:32:29,028 --> 01:32:32,010
[SPEAKER_08]: How much more is it that the people of this community want to take?

1154
01:32:32,350 --> 01:32:37,052
[SPEAKER_08]: When are you going to realize that your open government is not open like you think it is?

1155
01:32:37,532 --> 01:32:43,596
[SPEAKER_08]: And your notorious government is as notorious as it can be, because there's no transparency as to what's going on.

1156
01:32:45,216 --> 01:32:51,380
[SPEAKER_08]: This letter should have been ID'd with a date, and it should have addressed itself DMF resident.

1157
01:32:52,160 --> 01:32:57,923
[SPEAKER_08]: In the near future, giving it the date, your bill will be going up the following, and it'll give the reason why.

1158
01:32:58,325 --> 01:33:05,971
[SPEAKER_08]: But the insanity of saying that a three-family or a two-family or a four-family house is going to be divided by the amount of units, and that's what they're going to pay.

1159
01:33:07,372 --> 01:33:08,393
[SPEAKER_08]: They have no right saying that.

1160
01:33:08,413 --> 01:33:09,394
[SPEAKER_08]: They have no right doing that.

1161
01:33:09,874 --> 01:33:19,021
[SPEAKER_08]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I'm moving that our Board of Water and Soil Commissioners appear before the Medford City Council to discuss this particular matter.

1162
01:33:20,342 --> 01:33:20,942
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilman Knight.

1163
01:33:22,964 --> 01:33:24,245
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much, Mr. President.

1164
01:33:28,789 --> 01:33:33,650
[SPEAKER_03]: taken a big interest in recent weeks to the water and sewer billing system and the rates that are in place.

1165
01:33:33,890 --> 01:33:43,273
[SPEAKER_03]: And in my research, I've been able to determine that in 2006, of the MWRA communities, Medford was the 15th highest consumer.

1166
01:33:44,413 --> 01:33:50,355
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's also my understanding that a tiered rate system is put in place to promote conservation of use of water.

1167
01:33:51,815 --> 01:33:57,497
[SPEAKER_03]: Previous councils, dating back as far as I've looked to 2007, have consistently voted to establish a tiered rate system.

1168
01:33:58,312 --> 01:34:01,934
[SPEAKER_03]: We have paper 07464 to establish a tiered rate.

1169
01:34:02,034 --> 01:34:07,336
[SPEAKER_03]: Paper 07559 to establish a progressive H2O consumption system.

1170
01:34:08,296 --> 01:34:13,398
[SPEAKER_03]: Paper 08591, the city engineer present the tiered system for the council to review.

1171
01:34:13,418 --> 01:34:15,759
[SPEAKER_03]: 09535, a report on the tiered rate system.

1172
01:34:15,779 --> 01:34:17,160
[SPEAKER_03]: 09706, creation of a tiered system.

1173
01:34:17,180 --> 01:34:18,700
[SPEAKER_03]: 09838, an excessive use of water program.

1174
01:34:18,820 --> 01:34:20,281
[SPEAKER_03]: 10036, the status of a tiered rate system.

1175
01:34:29,347 --> 01:34:31,788
[SPEAKER_03]: 720, report back on the progress of creating a tiered system.

1176
01:34:33,769 --> 01:34:42,392
[SPEAKER_03]: Dating back to 12-4-07, the Medford City Council has been on record in supporting looking at water and sewer rates and eyeing a multi-tiered system.

1177
01:34:42,772 --> 01:34:49,395
[SPEAKER_03]: As recently as 12-24, Mr. President, there was an article in the Medford transcript saying that the City Council supported the implementation of a tiered system.

1178
01:34:49,495 --> 01:34:51,696
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Mayorka was a champion for such a program.

1179
01:34:52,016 --> 01:34:55,057
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Mayorka was of the theory that if you use more, you pay more.

1180
01:34:55,397 --> 01:34:57,838
[SPEAKER_03]: And I certainly agree with that philosophy, Mr. President.

1181
01:34:59,130 --> 01:35:03,032
[SPEAKER_03]: In looking at how the rates are determined, we have a Water and Sewer Commission.

1182
01:35:03,072 --> 01:35:04,954
[SPEAKER_03]: The Water and Sewer Commission meets monthly.

1183
01:35:04,994 --> 01:35:10,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Here in my city council packet this week, I received a notice of when this Water and Sewer Commission is going to meet.

1184
01:35:10,597 --> 01:35:18,522
[SPEAKER_03]: For the edification of the people at home, I'd like to let them know that on October 15, 2014, in room 201, at 2 o'clock, the Water and Sewer Commission will be meeting.

1185
01:35:18,982 --> 01:35:20,723
[SPEAKER_03]: It's open to the public and all members can attend.

1186
01:35:21,204 --> 01:35:26,647
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, I certainly share some concerns about the itemization of the bill, and I too have seen irregularities in water bills, my own included.

1187
01:35:27,504 --> 01:35:28,044
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President.

1188
01:35:28,084 --> 01:35:35,307
[SPEAKER_03]: However, I think to say that this is a surprise is a little bit of a misconstrue of what's happened.

1189
01:35:35,528 --> 01:35:37,368
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not in line with what the history shows.

1190
01:35:37,448 --> 01:35:38,709
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not in line with what the history says.

1191
01:35:42,390 --> 01:35:43,371
[SPEAKER_11]: Point of clarification.

1192
01:35:43,391 --> 01:35:45,612
[SPEAKER_08]: I hear what Councilor Knight is talking about.

1193
01:35:46,032 --> 01:35:47,473
[SPEAKER_08]: My point of clarification is this.

1194
01:35:47,513 --> 01:35:55,216
[SPEAKER_08]: While he may be running off a string of resolutions, we had asked for a public hearing and a public meeting on this and for whatever

1195
01:35:55,629 --> 01:35:59,252
[SPEAKER_08]: the Water and Soil Commissioners might have done or made the determination.

1196
01:35:59,652 --> 01:36:04,716
[SPEAKER_08]: The council has been asked to be apprised, and they've been asked to appear before here, and they never have.

1197
01:36:05,217 --> 01:36:08,760
[SPEAKER_08]: So 800 getting to the baseline, how did you get to it?

1198
01:36:09,160 --> 01:36:10,441
[SPEAKER_08]: Where did you come up with that number?

1199
01:36:10,961 --> 01:36:15,945
[SPEAKER_08]: Because if you look at a lot of the residential homes, they're going to be between 800 and that 1,600 mark.

1200
01:36:16,326 --> 01:36:25,193
[SPEAKER_08]: So by going over by one cubic feet, you're going to be putting that residential homeowner, who might have two or three kids or taking care of a senior citizen, paying a higher rate.

1201
01:36:26,059 --> 01:36:29,060
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's where I think the discussion needs to take place.

1202
01:36:29,820 --> 01:36:33,601
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not denying the fact that the more you use, the more you should pay.

1203
01:36:34,121 --> 01:36:38,222
[SPEAKER_08]: But this is a big gap from $800 to $800 to $1,600.

1204
01:36:38,603 --> 01:36:42,764
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you are just a little bit over that, you're going to be saddled with that additional thing.

1205
01:36:42,984 --> 01:36:48,905
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, as I said, if somebody has multiple people living in their family home, they're going to be penalized for using the water.

1206
01:36:49,005 --> 01:36:51,006
[SPEAKER_08]: If they use a dramatic amount, that's one thing.

1207
01:36:51,786 --> 01:36:55,830
[SPEAKER_11]: But the way this letter is written... Councilor, your point has been made.

1208
01:36:55,870 --> 01:36:57,111
[SPEAKER_11]: You'll have plenty of time to speak on this.

1209
01:36:57,172 --> 01:36:59,114
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Knight has the floor.

1210
01:36:59,174 --> 01:37:00,335
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much, Mr. President.

1211
01:37:00,535 --> 01:37:01,196
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was getting there.

1212
01:37:01,776 --> 01:37:07,362
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that, you know, when we get a response from the mayor saying to call a public hearings within the council purview, it is.

1213
01:37:07,522 --> 01:37:13,148
[SPEAKER_03]: We have subcommittees, we have committees, committees of the whole, which has the power to call a committee meeting.

1214
01:37:13,168 --> 01:37:14,109
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a committee on

1215
01:37:14,744 --> 01:37:16,384
[SPEAKER_03]: auditing finance, budget, and taxation.

1216
01:37:16,444 --> 01:37:22,466
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a subcommittee on intergovernmental affairs, and I think that when we call for a public hearing, we don't need to have the permission of the mayor to do that.

1217
01:37:22,546 --> 01:37:28,948
[SPEAKER_03]: We can use our internal governmental structure that we have here as a council in order to promote these meetings, in order to make these meetings happen.

1218
01:37:28,968 --> 01:37:38,810
[SPEAKER_03]: So when I looked at it and I saw that it falls within the council purview, and then I read the language in the resolution, I said, well, I think that this refers to the fact that the council does have the power to call this meeting, and we don't need the mayor to give us authority to do such.

1219
01:37:39,670 --> 01:37:41,111
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's where I'm coming from, Mr. President.

1220
01:37:41,131 --> 01:37:43,111
[SPEAKER_03]: I certainly feel as though we need to have a

1221
01:37:43,427 --> 01:37:48,848
[SPEAKER_03]: better line of communication in terms of the way that our water and sewer billing is implemented.

1222
01:37:48,888 --> 01:37:53,489
[SPEAKER_03]: And I certainly have concerns, because when we look at 2007, we look at the ideas that came out.

1223
01:37:53,569 --> 01:37:57,470
[SPEAKER_03]: And the tiered system was really 0 to 1,000 cubic feet of use.

1224
01:37:57,870 --> 01:37:58,651
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's gone down to 800.

1225
01:37:59,391 --> 01:38:02,972
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can understand that there must have been some deliberation and some decision-making process.

1226
01:38:03,012 --> 01:38:05,352
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, too, share the concerns as to how do we get to this figure.

1227
01:38:05,932 --> 01:38:13,134
[SPEAKER_03]: It's my understanding that, based upon conversations that I've had with members of the Water Sewer Commission, that about two-thirds of the households in the city will fall in the first tier.

1228
01:38:14,149 --> 01:38:20,233
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't seen any hard facts and hard figures on that, but that's what's been represented to me through the conversations that I've had with the Water and Sewer Commission, Mr. President.

1229
01:38:20,893 --> 01:38:30,538
[SPEAKER_03]: So with that being said, I certainly do not see any reason for us to go to the mayor's office and ask the mayor for permission to hold a hearing on this when we have a perfect structure that's in place that's underutilized right now in order to do such.

1230
01:38:31,159 --> 01:38:41,044
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would move, Mr. President, this be forwarded to one of the appropriate subcommittees that we have here that's in existence already for us to actually take ownership of the issue and get the answers that we need without relying on somebody else giving them to them.

1231
01:38:41,084 --> 01:38:41,945
[SPEAKER_03]: We can go and extract them.

1232
01:38:44,588 --> 01:38:45,288
[SPEAKER_11]: Point of further what?

1233
01:38:46,429 --> 01:38:46,909
[SPEAKER_11]: Clarification.

1234
01:38:46,949 --> 01:38:47,649
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, clarification.

1235
01:38:47,669 --> 01:38:47,989
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1236
01:38:48,549 --> 01:38:50,510
[SPEAKER_08]: I hear what Councilor Knight is alluding to.

1237
01:38:50,530 --> 01:38:52,411
[SPEAKER_08]: The point is valid.

1238
01:38:52,711 --> 01:38:53,971
[SPEAKER_08]: It went from zero to 1,000.

1239
01:38:54,131 --> 01:38:54,911
[SPEAKER_08]: Why did it come down to 800?

1240
01:38:55,812 --> 01:39:04,414
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, if you speak to some of the members, they're going to turn around and tell you, this is part of the conservation mode of saving water and within families and stuff like that.

1241
01:39:04,434 --> 01:39:05,675
[SPEAKER_08]: Which I wholeheartedly support.

1242
01:39:05,875 --> 01:39:05,995
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

1243
01:39:06,315 --> 01:39:12,377
[SPEAKER_08]: But I don't think anybody's going to deny the fact that, you know, you don't want to penalize people because they have people living in their homes.

1244
01:39:12,810 --> 01:39:18,397
[SPEAKER_08]: who might be seniors or elderly or babies or two or three children or for whatever it might be.

1245
01:39:18,957 --> 01:39:22,982
[SPEAKER_08]: And I would be not in favor of having a subcommittee.

1246
01:39:23,002 --> 01:39:26,766
[SPEAKER_08]: I would be in favor of just having, calling for the public hearing and have them come in and explain it.

1247
01:39:27,007 --> 01:39:28,428
[SPEAKER_08]: They've already mean what they did.

1248
01:39:29,149 --> 01:39:33,154
[SPEAKER_08]: And one point further, and I think as a Councilor, Councilor Marks, I think we had this conversation.

1249
01:39:34,636 --> 01:39:41,202
[SPEAKER_08]: Getting to the point of the households, as Councilor Knight has just alluded to, how did you make this determination?

1250
01:39:41,902 --> 01:39:48,288
[SPEAKER_08]: Where are the numbers of those homes that are between 0 to 800, and from 800 to 1,600, and over that?

1251
01:39:49,069 --> 01:39:57,857
[SPEAKER_08]: They have to have statistics to do that, because if they just decided to go to 800 because it sounded good, because it was a good conservation move, well, that's not good.

1252
01:39:58,536 --> 01:40:02,819
[SPEAKER_08]: If there's people between 800 and 850, whatever it might be, there's nothing wrong with going to 1,000.

1253
01:40:02,859 --> 01:40:03,919
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that's a compromise.

1254
01:40:04,199 --> 01:40:05,080
[SPEAKER_08]: I got no problem with that.

1255
01:40:05,560 --> 01:40:06,961
[SPEAKER_08]: But I want to see these numbers.

1256
01:40:07,781 --> 01:40:08,502
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to see these numbers.

1257
01:40:08,522 --> 01:40:10,323
[SPEAKER_11]: Point of information, Councilor Dello Russo.

1258
01:40:11,274 --> 01:40:14,597
[SPEAKER_02]: helpful rather than speculating to invite them down before the council.

1259
01:40:14,637 --> 01:40:20,863
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if we should call it a public hearing, but have them appear before the council for the purpose of information.

1260
01:40:21,543 --> 01:40:23,505
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, this should be done regularly.

1261
01:40:24,166 --> 01:40:25,787
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, excuse me for going over.

1262
01:40:26,187 --> 01:40:32,193
[SPEAKER_02]: This should be done regularly with any number of issues within this community to refresh people's memory.

1263
01:40:33,314 --> 01:40:34,295
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for your point.

1264
01:40:34,315 --> 01:40:37,878
[SPEAKER_08]: I just remind councilor Dello Russo, one thing we had asked at one point in time,

1265
01:40:39,093 --> 01:40:41,213
[SPEAKER_08]: to have our city engineer appear before the council.

1266
01:40:41,393 --> 01:40:43,354
[SPEAKER_08]: And she didn't come because the mayor told her not to come.

1267
01:40:43,934 --> 01:40:44,214
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

1268
01:40:44,474 --> 01:40:47,515
[SPEAKER_08]: So we can ask the Water and Soil Commissioners to come.

1269
01:40:47,995 --> 01:40:53,016
[SPEAKER_08]: But if they choose not to come because they're told not to come, where does that put the council?

1270
01:40:54,176 --> 01:40:58,517
[SPEAKER_11]: Chairperson Camara is very responsive.

1271
01:40:59,737 --> 01:41:01,077
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a gem in our community.

1272
01:41:01,117 --> 01:41:04,778
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't see any reason why on earth that he wouldn't come down here.

1273
01:41:05,168 --> 01:41:08,771
[SPEAKER_02]: to have a conversation, not to be cross-examined and prosecuted.

1274
01:41:10,132 --> 01:41:10,793
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Marks.

1275
01:41:11,833 --> 01:41:14,916
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President, I thank my Councilor colleague for bringing this up.

1276
01:41:15,116 --> 01:41:22,002
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think actually Councilor Knight hit the nail on the head on the fact that the ball's in our court.

1277
01:41:22,502 --> 01:41:33,791
[SPEAKER_06]: And if we want to have a public hearing here, if we want to have a committee of the whole meeting, if we want to have a subcommittee meeting, I personally prefer the fact that the Water and Sewer Commission has come up before the podium, as was just stated,

1278
01:41:34,444 --> 01:41:36,525
[SPEAKER_06]: and present to us the plan.

1279
01:41:36,985 --> 01:41:51,792
[SPEAKER_06]: Because honestly, I think we've all advocated for a tiered system for a number of years, and I wasn't aware that potentially they would mesh, if you live in a three-family, all three together, and then they would divide by that.

1280
01:41:52,512 --> 01:41:54,053
[SPEAKER_06]: I wasn't aware it would work that way.

1281
01:41:54,093 --> 01:41:56,634
[SPEAKER_06]: But these are the things I think that we have to listen to.

1282
01:41:57,374 --> 01:42:00,736
[SPEAKER_06]: And regarding where the tier falls, if it's 0 to 800, or 800 to 1600,

1283
01:42:03,792 --> 01:42:06,694
[SPEAKER_06]: At any point you decide on, there's going to be a cutoff.

1284
01:42:06,774 --> 01:42:11,116
[SPEAKER_06]: So if it was zero to 1,000, what about the people that are 1,001?

1285
01:42:12,257 --> 01:42:14,918
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't think you can really go too much on that.

1286
01:42:15,499 --> 01:42:27,086
[SPEAKER_06]: And as was mentioned, the tier system that we push for as a council, and don't forget, the council also pushed for, and it's been implemented, a second meter outside to save on your sewer bill.

1287
01:42:28,907 --> 01:42:31,348
[SPEAKER_06]: That was another initiative by this council pushing

1288
01:42:32,504 --> 01:42:46,864
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the TAD system will eventually promote, as was mentioned, conservation in the community, but also make people mindful of the fact, because the water and sewage, you feel like you have no control over.

1289
01:42:46,984 --> 01:42:47,525
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's face it.

1290
01:42:48,335 --> 01:42:50,716
[SPEAKER_06]: You go to the restroom, you've got to flush your toilet.

1291
01:42:50,976 --> 01:42:51,836
[SPEAKER_06]: You've got to take a shower.

1292
01:42:51,856 --> 01:42:53,077
[SPEAKER_06]: You've got to drink water.

1293
01:42:53,357 --> 01:42:55,977
[SPEAKER_06]: You've got to wash your lawn.

1294
01:42:56,338 --> 01:42:59,318
[SPEAKER_06]: There's basic things that you need to do with water.

1295
01:42:59,799 --> 01:43:05,901
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is the first time that someone may have control over what their bill is actually going to look like.

1296
01:43:06,321 --> 01:43:11,962
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you wanted to conserve and fall into a different range, then you could do that.

1297
01:43:12,042 --> 01:43:13,503
[SPEAKER_06]: You'd make every effort to do so.

1298
01:43:14,683 --> 01:43:17,184
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think we'll end up.

1299
01:43:17,751 --> 01:43:22,633
[SPEAKER_06]: saving as Councilor Knight mentioned in the long run, people money, save money in this community.

1300
01:43:23,354 --> 01:43:28,696
[SPEAKER_06]: And the fact that we have, as Councilor Penta just mentioned, $8 million, I am shocked to hear $8 million.

1301
01:43:28,716 --> 01:43:36,040
[SPEAKER_06]: I know it was $6.5 million or right around $6 million not too long ago, but that account is growing exponentially.

1302
01:43:36,060 --> 01:43:39,181
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, every member of this Council has stated

1303
01:43:40,343 --> 01:43:44,949
[SPEAKER_06]: That count was never intended to be this pot of gold, Mr. President.

1304
01:43:45,269 --> 01:43:49,094
[SPEAKER_06]: It's for infrastructure improvements and to offset water and sewer rates.

1305
01:43:49,755 --> 01:43:53,821
[SPEAKER_06]: And God knows we need a lot of infrastructure improvements.

1306
01:43:54,704 --> 01:44:04,086
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, the water and sewer that's, the water that's seeping into our old drain pipes, our old sewer pipes, that's costing us millions of dollars to treat as raw sewage.

1307
01:44:04,746 --> 01:44:13,987
[SPEAKER_06]: As Councilor Penton mentioned, INI, the, I mean, the leak detection program, that's also costing the rate payers of this community millions of dollars.

1308
01:44:14,668 --> 01:44:17,948
[SPEAKER_06]: These are the things that that $8 million should be going into.

1309
01:44:18,488 --> 01:44:22,989
[SPEAKER_06]: We have illegal catch basins right now that are directly connected to the sewer system.

1310
01:44:23,376 --> 01:44:32,504
[SPEAKER_06]: So when it rains, that water goes out, and it's just groundwater, and it's treated as raw sewage, costing us millions of dollars a year.

1311
01:44:32,925 --> 01:44:34,506
[SPEAKER_06]: We know where these catch basins are.

1312
01:44:34,786 --> 01:44:36,087
[SPEAKER_06]: We have $8 million.

1313
01:44:36,508 --> 01:44:40,091
[SPEAKER_06]: Why aren't we doing anything to improve the infrastructure, Mr. President?

1314
01:44:40,370 --> 01:44:47,314
[SPEAKER_06]: This has been a bone of contention that I've spoken about for years, Mr. President, and now we have money sitting in a fund.

1315
01:44:48,475 --> 01:44:50,536
[SPEAKER_06]: Why don't we use it for infrastructure improvements?

1316
01:44:50,916 --> 01:44:55,699
[SPEAKER_06]: I know some attempts have been made, and we've made some progress in that direction.

1317
01:44:56,261 --> 01:45:00,482
[SPEAKER_06]: of improving inflow and infiltration and also leak detection.

1318
01:45:00,882 --> 01:45:04,223
[SPEAKER_06]: But at the rate we're going, we're never going to get ahead of the bell curve.

1319
01:45:04,663 --> 01:45:06,504
[SPEAKER_06]: We're never going to get ahead.

1320
01:45:06,524 --> 01:45:11,125
[SPEAKER_06]: And residents are going to be looking at their bills saying, someday this is going to be more than my tax bill.

1321
01:45:11,905 --> 01:45:14,506
[SPEAKER_06]: And the way we're going, this is not my statement.

1322
01:45:14,526 --> 01:45:20,088
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been stated 100 times before this council that someday your water and sewer bill

1323
01:45:20,796 --> 01:45:21,957
[SPEAKER_06]: will be more than your taxes.

1324
01:45:22,497 --> 01:45:24,998
[SPEAKER_06]: And people will be looking to point the blame.

1325
01:45:25,478 --> 01:45:31,501
[SPEAKER_06]: And all they can point to that is the fact that we've done very little as a community to improve our infrastructure.

1326
01:45:32,241 --> 01:45:34,082
[SPEAKER_06]: We've done very little to improve it.

1327
01:45:34,402 --> 01:45:38,764
[SPEAKER_06]: We do take advantage of 0% finance loans every so often and so forth.

1328
01:45:39,164 --> 01:45:45,767
[SPEAKER_06]: But we're never going to get ahead of the hundreds of miles of pipe that exist underneath our roads.

1329
01:45:46,331 --> 01:45:47,893
[SPEAKER_06]: unless we start being proactive.

1330
01:45:48,433 --> 01:45:50,735
[SPEAKER_06]: Every year, take up a certain hotspot.

1331
01:45:50,995 --> 01:45:54,078
[SPEAKER_06]: We know the hotspots are where there's a lot of leakage and so forth.

1332
01:45:54,359 --> 01:45:57,702
[SPEAKER_06]: We know where the hotspots are that are accepting groundwater.

1333
01:45:57,962 --> 01:45:59,103
[SPEAKER_06]: We know where the leaks are.

1334
01:45:59,443 --> 01:46:02,526
[SPEAKER_06]: We know where all the issues stand, Mr. President.

1335
01:46:03,047 --> 01:46:07,671
[SPEAKER_06]: However, because it's underground, you know, out of sight, out of mind, the old saying.

1336
01:46:08,132 --> 01:46:10,734
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, the administration tends to put that on the back burner.

1337
01:46:11,340 --> 01:46:18,005
[SPEAKER_06]: And they like to have that little nest egg out there so they can say, well, our bond rating is low because we have these reserves.

1338
01:46:18,786 --> 01:46:29,935
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think we should be using the rate payers' reserves out there if we're not going to the intended purpose, which is infrastructure improvements and to lower the rates, just to say we can get a better bond rating.

1339
01:46:30,355 --> 01:46:32,357
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not the intent of that account.

1340
01:46:32,847 --> 01:46:42,992
[SPEAKER_06]: And the intent is definitely not to build an $8 million surplus on your hard-earned money, Mr. President, my hard-earned money, and every other taxpayer in this community that's working to make a buck.

1341
01:46:43,433 --> 01:46:46,234
[SPEAKER_06]: We should be holding $8 million in reserve, Mr. President.

1342
01:46:46,494 --> 01:46:49,115
[SPEAKER_06]: I thank my colleague, Councilor Penta, for bringing this up.

1343
01:46:53,158 --> 01:46:53,578
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Mack.

1344
01:46:53,598 --> 01:46:54,458
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much, Mr. President.

1345
01:46:55,079 --> 01:46:58,220
[SPEAKER_03]: I echo the sentiments relative to infrastructure that Councilor Max has raised.

1346
01:47:00,515 --> 01:47:02,877
[SPEAKER_03]: Our MWRA assessment is calculated every year.

1347
01:47:02,897 --> 01:47:08,742
[SPEAKER_03]: It's done so by the MWRA estimating the total amount of revenue that's going to be necessary for them to run their water system.

1348
01:47:09,603 --> 01:47:15,008
[SPEAKER_03]: The chart is then calculated at a flat rate times the metered water used in a community, and that's how they come up with their assessment.

1349
01:47:15,368 --> 01:47:19,972
[SPEAKER_03]: However, it's interesting to point out that debt service represents 60% of the FY15 budget at the MWRA.

1350
01:47:19,992 --> 01:47:20,853
[SPEAKER_03]: So that means 60%

1351
01:47:23,826 --> 01:47:28,767
[SPEAKER_03]: of their budget is dedicated just to debt service for infrastructure improvements that they've made to deliver these water to us.

1352
01:47:29,128 --> 01:47:34,289
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it's time that we need to take a look internally and say, OK, now it's time for us to make this commitment to our infrastructure.

1353
01:47:34,589 --> 01:47:38,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Because ultimately, in the long run, it is going to reduce the cost for the individuals in this community to pay water bills.

1354
01:47:43,592 --> 01:47:44,892
[SPEAKER_11]: Aim and address for the record, please.

1355
01:47:45,092 --> 01:47:45,412
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1356
01:47:45,452 --> 01:47:46,633
[SPEAKER_01]: Jean Martin, 10 Cumming Street.

1357
01:47:47,833 --> 01:47:49,754
[SPEAKER_01]: You're absolutely right, Mr. Knight and Mr. Marks.

1358
01:47:51,840 --> 01:47:55,783
[SPEAKER_01]: If we are one of the highest users of water, it's because we're one of the oldest cities.

1359
01:47:56,744 --> 01:48:00,047
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at it from the state perspective, we're 1630.

1360
01:48:00,507 --> 01:48:01,148
[SPEAKER_01]: We were founded.

1361
01:48:01,648 --> 01:48:02,889
[SPEAKER_01]: We're one of the oldest communities.

1362
01:48:03,249 --> 01:48:05,291
[SPEAKER_01]: We're one of the most densest communities.

1363
01:48:05,591 --> 01:48:06,372
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not Somerville.

1364
01:48:06,632 --> 01:48:08,373
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not East Boston.

1365
01:48:08,413 --> 01:48:12,136
[SPEAKER_01]: There are more dense communities than us, but we are a dense community.

1366
01:48:12,396 --> 01:48:17,160
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you go out of 495, you come across smaller communities and less need for the water.

1367
01:48:17,240 --> 01:48:17,961
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have wells.

1368
01:48:18,885 --> 01:48:21,134
[SPEAKER_01]: You go outside at 495 and they have well water.

1369
01:48:22,409 --> 01:48:26,292
[SPEAKER_01]: The MWRA is around Boston, and it's a consolidated area.

1370
01:48:26,912 --> 01:48:29,554
[SPEAKER_01]: And Mr. Marks hit it on the head.

1371
01:48:30,175 --> 01:48:35,798
[SPEAKER_01]: The $8.5 million needs to be drawn down.

1372
01:48:36,439 --> 01:48:40,441
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, the mayor is doing what is in his legal right to do.

1373
01:48:41,042 --> 01:48:49,167
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't blame it on the mayor this time, because there's no law that prevents him from drawing off of this account as much as he can.

1374
01:48:49,587 --> 01:48:51,649
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no top number.

1375
01:48:52,869 --> 01:48:53,489
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh sure, go ahead.

1376
01:48:54,510 --> 01:48:56,250
[SPEAKER_08]: Point of clarification, Councilor Penta.

1377
01:48:56,290 --> 01:49:14,215
[SPEAKER_08]: The law says explicitly if the estimated income is more than the total appropriations, the excess shall be appropriated to a separate reserve fund and used for capital expenditures of the enterprise subject to the appropriation or to reduce user charges if authorized by the appropriate entity.

1378
01:49:14,602 --> 01:49:16,864
[SPEAKER_08]: responsible for operations of the enterprise.

1379
01:49:16,944 --> 01:49:18,825
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so that is his responsibility.

1380
01:49:18,845 --> 01:49:19,225
[SPEAKER_01]: So he can.

1381
01:49:19,265 --> 01:49:19,966
[SPEAKER_08]: He can the law.

1382
01:49:20,006 --> 01:49:20,987
[SPEAKER_01]: He can absolutely.

1383
01:49:21,047 --> 01:49:21,587
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.

1384
01:49:21,707 --> 01:49:24,769
[SPEAKER_01]: He can absolutely take that number down and put it towards infrastructure.

1385
01:49:25,350 --> 01:49:27,571
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's up to the people of Medford, once again.

1386
01:49:27,691 --> 01:49:33,315
[SPEAKER_01]: And until the people of Medford decide that they're going to come here and show up,

1387
01:49:34,216 --> 01:49:35,457
[SPEAKER_01]: and make their voices heard.

1388
01:49:36,237 --> 01:49:38,959
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really do have an appreciation for you guys now.

1389
01:49:39,319 --> 01:49:41,661
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if I'm going native or what.

1390
01:49:41,701 --> 01:49:42,041
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

1391
01:49:43,242 --> 01:49:46,143
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do see you guys as working really, really hard.

1392
01:49:46,884 --> 01:49:48,725
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a body, I see that happening.

1393
01:49:49,025 --> 01:49:54,048
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe I've been coming here for like three years now, and so I'm getting osmosis or something.

1394
01:49:54,408 --> 01:49:59,531
[SPEAKER_01]: But through osmosis, I'm coming to appreciate you guys instead of seeing you as the enemy.

1395
01:50:00,052 --> 01:50:02,273
[SPEAKER_01]: Anywho, so anyway.

1396
01:50:03,914 --> 01:50:07,655
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, the mayor isn't doing anything illegal.

1397
01:50:08,135 --> 01:50:20,919
[SPEAKER_01]: So either the people have to make him, by pressuring him, by showing up at his doorstep and saying, we want that $8 million drawn down to $1.5 million just in case there's a main water break.

1398
01:50:22,099 --> 01:50:30,821
[SPEAKER_01]: And until we do that, he can sit there and collect all the money he wants and use it for the bond rating, which is not what it's intended to do.

1399
01:50:31,342 --> 01:50:32,342
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're absolutely right.

1400
01:50:33,530 --> 01:50:40,299
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason why we are such heavy users of water is because we have so many leaks in our system, too.

1401
01:50:40,700 --> 01:50:42,142
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a self-feeding system.

1402
01:50:42,702 --> 01:50:47,949
[SPEAKER_01]: If we don't take care of the leaks in the water and sewer, then we use more water as a city.

1403
01:50:48,792 --> 01:50:50,674
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a self-fulfilling problem.

1404
01:50:51,315 --> 01:50:53,798
[SPEAKER_01]: And until we take care of that, but it has to be the people.

1405
01:50:54,399 --> 01:51:04,712
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys can sit here all day and all night, and I've really heard you guys, all day and all night, all day and all night, say the same thing over and over again, and it's like a hamster wheel.

1406
01:51:04,952 --> 01:51:05,553
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know what?

1407
01:51:05,653 --> 01:51:08,096
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't give up, because you guys got the DPW yard built.

1408
01:51:08,874 --> 01:51:09,675
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't give up.

1409
01:51:10,055 --> 01:51:11,397
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys helped fix housing.

1410
01:51:11,437 --> 01:51:13,899
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys helped fix, get rid of TV3.

1411
01:51:14,600 --> 01:51:15,761
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are making a difference.

1412
01:51:16,442 --> 01:51:17,884
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to keep on banging on that drum.

1413
01:51:18,664 --> 01:51:25,412
[SPEAKER_01]: But until the people start helping you to force the issues, nothing's going to change.

1414
01:51:25,452 --> 01:51:28,455
[SPEAKER_01]: But you got to keep your voices out there and be heard.

1415
01:51:28,775 --> 01:51:31,717
[SPEAKER_01]: So I agree with the transparency, have your committee meetings.

1416
01:51:32,557 --> 01:51:34,738
[SPEAKER_01]: I could start a petition on so many issues in the city.

1417
01:51:34,938 --> 01:51:36,779
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just... You want to take one for the dog pack?

1418
01:51:37,040 --> 01:51:37,280
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1419
01:51:37,960 --> 01:51:38,841
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I already signed that one.

1420
01:51:39,461 --> 01:51:39,821
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1421
01:51:39,841 --> 01:51:41,362
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what I have to say on that topic.

1422
01:51:41,442 --> 01:51:41,982
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.

1423
01:51:42,343 --> 01:51:42,843
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Ms.

1424
01:51:42,883 --> 01:51:43,143
[SPEAKER_11]: Martin.

1425
01:51:43,663 --> 01:51:45,144
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion, Councilor Penta.

1426
01:51:45,164 --> 01:51:51,628
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, also the letter indicates further down that they're going to keep this baseline rate for the first year.

1427
01:51:51,988 --> 01:51:54,289
[SPEAKER_08]: So the intention is that they're going to be going up.

1428
01:51:54,749 --> 01:51:55,850
[SPEAKER_08]: So with that being said,

1429
01:51:56,600 --> 01:52:14,706
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to make the request that the Board of Water and Soil Commissioners appear before the Medford City Council to discuss this letter that went out that's unsigned, undated, as it represents, and that a new bill be forthcoming.

1430
01:52:15,186 --> 01:52:21,229
[SPEAKER_08]: They revised the bill that includes the rate for the water and the rate for the sewage.

1431
01:52:22,961 --> 01:52:24,202
[SPEAKER_08]: and along with the total amount.

1432
01:52:24,823 --> 01:52:29,686
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, the letter negates to put in here that it's nothing more than the new use.

1433
01:52:29,746 --> 01:52:33,769
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't have the old use by consumption and water and sewer charges.

1434
01:52:34,250 --> 01:52:48,701
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that would be, once again, pure transparency for the rate payers at least to see what's going on other than, once again, just getting a letter saying, you know, this is what you're going to have to pay and your rates are going up and, you know, with no clarification, absolutely no education.

1435
01:52:49,241 --> 01:52:50,122
[SPEAKER_08]: There was absolutely nothing.

1436
01:52:50,863 --> 01:52:52,845
[SPEAKER_08]: You notice that the mayor did not.

1437
01:52:52,885 --> 01:52:54,746
[SPEAKER_08]: Listen, the Board of Soil Commissioners worked for the mayor.

1438
01:52:55,266 --> 01:52:56,768
[SPEAKER_08]: They're his appointments on that board.

1439
01:52:57,208 --> 01:52:58,569
[SPEAKER_08]: The mayor owns this one as well.

1440
01:52:58,609 --> 01:52:59,910
[SPEAKER_08]: This is his responsibility.

1441
01:53:00,270 --> 01:53:02,632
[SPEAKER_08]: If he knew the rates were going up, for which they have.

1442
01:53:03,332 --> 01:53:18,163
[SPEAKER_08]: And if this is his end run to circumvent this council, because this council wouldn't give him his parking garage and wouldn't give him his $600,000 in the budget for 10% water rate increase, this is certainly the wrong way to go, especially with $8.4 million.

1443
01:53:19,722 --> 01:53:21,343
[SPEAKER_08]: sitting in the surplus account.

1444
01:53:21,564 --> 01:53:22,985
[SPEAKER_08]: That is just so wrong.

1445
01:53:23,926 --> 01:53:36,916
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, you're ripping off the taxpayers once again, Mr. Mayor, knowing that their money is just sitting in an account to make you look good at a bond rating at the expense of the taxpayers.

1446
01:53:36,956 --> 01:53:41,440
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe they'd like to enjoy some of that money and spend it on their family or their kids or what have you.

1447
01:53:42,481 --> 01:53:44,742
[SPEAKER_08]: So with that being said, I move the question, Mr. President.

1448
01:53:46,371 --> 01:53:47,832
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, well, the chair has a question.

1449
01:53:47,872 --> 01:53:51,454
[SPEAKER_11]: We have two motions that somewhat are contradictory.

1450
01:53:51,594 --> 01:53:54,295
[SPEAKER_11]: One is to send it to the entire council.

1451
01:53:54,395 --> 01:53:59,078
[SPEAKER_11]: One is to send it to the subcommittee and have the Water and Sewer Commissioners there.

1452
01:53:59,118 --> 01:54:00,799
[SPEAKER_11]: So, Councilor Knight.

1453
01:54:01,740 --> 01:54:04,461
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, I do appreciate where Councilor Pentland is coming from.

1454
01:54:04,501 --> 01:54:10,584
[SPEAKER_03]: However, where we're asking so many questions and we have so many questions, I think it would be better vetted appropriately in the subcommittee.

1455
01:54:10,604 --> 01:54:15,187
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that we can ask these questions, we can get answers to these questions, then we can convene as a body as a whole.

1456
01:54:15,612 --> 01:54:22,637
[SPEAKER_03]: and we can make recommendations to the Water and Sewer Commission, instead of asking these questions to the Water and Sewer Commission and not having any opportunity to properly vet it.

1457
01:54:23,198 --> 01:54:25,800
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why, Mr. President, I will not be withdrawing my motion to amend.

1458
01:54:27,081 --> 01:54:30,163
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Penter, are you amenable to have it at budget?

1459
01:54:30,323 --> 01:54:33,105
[SPEAKER_08]: I can go either way because it's obvious that this has already been done.

1460
01:54:33,446 --> 01:54:44,334
[SPEAKER_08]: From the documents that I have secured from the Water and Sewer Commission, they've been talking about this since April of this past year with the city engineer and Mr. Woodcock, the MWRA, the legal counsel, and what have you.

1461
01:54:44,707 --> 01:54:46,548
[SPEAKER_08]: So their determination has already been made.

1462
01:54:46,628 --> 01:54:50,109
[SPEAKER_08]: My question is going to be very simple and germane, basically what we had here tonight.

1463
01:54:50,209 --> 01:54:59,673
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, the one thing, you know, they're saying that they cannot make the recommendation to reduce the water and sewer rates.

1464
01:54:59,713 --> 01:55:04,295
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, if they can't make the recommendation to reduce it, how can they make the recommendation to increase it?

1465
01:55:04,535 --> 01:55:05,435
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't make any sense.

1466
01:55:05,816 --> 01:55:07,456
[SPEAKER_08]: The law doesn't prohibit them from doing that.

1467
01:55:07,916 --> 01:55:11,658
[SPEAKER_08]: And with an $8.4 million surplus, in the best interest of this community,

1468
01:55:12,062 --> 01:55:19,888
[SPEAKER_08]: It would have been a wonderful exposure by the Water and Soil Commission to recommend to the mayor that we not increase and we take this out of the Water and Soil account.

1469
01:55:20,269 --> 01:55:24,312
[SPEAKER_08]: But as we all know, this is the mayor's board, and they're going to do whatever the mayor tells them to do.

1470
01:55:24,793 --> 01:55:26,434
[SPEAKER_08]: So I can go either way on the resolution.

1471
01:55:26,454 --> 01:55:32,579
[SPEAKER_11]: So as I said, you're amenable to the subcommittee on budgeting, auditing, and finance.

1472
01:55:33,019 --> 01:55:35,742
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that your recommendation, Councilor Layton?

1473
01:55:35,762 --> 01:55:37,283
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, please, Mr. President.

1474
01:55:37,563 --> 01:55:37,843
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1475
01:55:37,883 --> 01:55:40,946
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion to send this to auditing, budget, and finance,

1476
01:55:41,997 --> 01:55:42,477
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Knight.

1477
01:55:42,958 --> 01:55:46,380
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd also like to see the city solicitor present where there are some questions relative to legalities.

1478
01:55:48,281 --> 01:55:49,702
[SPEAKER_11]: Invite the city solicitor to that meeting.

1479
01:55:51,003 --> 01:55:51,783
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Dello Russo.

1480
01:55:52,003 --> 01:55:57,527
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Councilor Knight's recommendation is the wise one and the wise course we should follow.

1481
01:55:58,087 --> 01:56:04,791
[SPEAKER_02]: In subcommittee then that gives us the opportunity to be a little more conversational with the members of the board to get questions answered.

1482
01:56:05,231 --> 01:56:10,795
[SPEAKER_02]: We can convene in council, have further deliberations among us.

1483
01:56:11,437 --> 01:56:18,519
[SPEAKER_02]: and then if we need to call them back, to ask them to come back to address further concerns, and take it from there.

1484
01:56:19,199 --> 01:56:31,301
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an exceptionally wise course, and I think Councilor Penta's bringing this to our attention is important for us to have this opportunity.

1485
01:56:32,822 --> 01:56:33,122
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1486
01:56:33,162 --> 01:56:33,722
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion.

1487
01:56:34,682 --> 01:56:35,342
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Penta.

1488
01:56:35,722 --> 01:56:36,162
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion.

1489
01:56:36,202 --> 01:56:37,143
[SPEAKER_08]: I got no problem with that.

1490
01:56:39,349 --> 01:56:42,211
[SPEAKER_08]: We only have three more meetings between now and we're off for two.

1491
01:56:42,271 --> 01:56:48,016
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would request that this meeting take place within the next two to three week, next two to three meetings that were available.

1492
01:56:48,496 --> 01:57:08,893
[SPEAKER_08]: But in the meantime, if we could have some information forwarded to us so we could at least know the proposed that they're giving us here, how they got to this baseline of 800, if we could get some information on how they got to that, if we get some information ahead of time, once again, what's the old rate compared to the new rates?

1493
01:57:09,825 --> 01:57:19,171
[SPEAKER_08]: And something as it relates to, you know, revising the bill that includes the water rates for water and sewer usage and the dollar amount.

1494
01:57:19,671 --> 01:57:23,353
[SPEAKER_08]: So at least when somebody gets it, they could figure it out rather than just getting numbers.

1495
01:57:24,033 --> 01:57:30,357
[SPEAKER_08]: Then the conversation on that particular night would just basically, you know, figure out the tiered rate.

1496
01:57:31,158 --> 01:57:33,639
[SPEAKER_08]: This lacks the word commercial rate in here.

1497
01:57:34,219 --> 01:57:38,702
[SPEAKER_08]: It says all other, all other establishments.

1498
01:57:39,485 --> 01:57:41,747
[SPEAKER_08]: which I'm assuming is going to be commercial.

1499
01:57:42,327 --> 01:57:43,028
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll find that out.

1500
01:57:43,709 --> 01:57:45,230
[SPEAKER_08]: So if we could have that and a roll call vote.

1501
01:57:45,270 --> 01:57:52,936
[SPEAKER_11]: Interesting enough, Councilor Pinto, you sit on that committee with Councilor Chairperson, Councilor Lungo-Koehn and Councilor Marks.

1502
01:57:53,497 --> 01:57:55,438
[SPEAKER_11]: So all those in favour on a roll call vote.

1503
01:57:56,439 --> 01:57:57,460
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Neidt, are you all set?

1504
01:57:58,067 --> 01:58:00,668
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, actually, Mr. President, I think that might make sense.

1505
01:58:00,728 --> 01:58:12,910
[SPEAKER_03]: If any of us have any questions that we'd like to have answered, that we send those questions to the chairperson of the subcommittee to forward to the water and sewer commission prior to this meeting taking place so that we can get this information to us beforehand and have a productive meeting as Councilor Penter suggested.

1506
01:58:14,150 --> 01:58:14,650
[SPEAKER_03]: Valid point.

1507
01:58:15,190 --> 01:58:15,890
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Marks.

1508
01:58:16,230 --> 01:58:16,750
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President.

1509
01:58:16,791 --> 01:58:21,931
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, in addition to the city solicitor, can we also invite the city engineer at the meeting?

1510
01:58:22,672 --> 01:58:24,792
[SPEAKER_06]: And did you mention Councilor Penter as the chair?

1511
01:58:25,285 --> 01:58:28,647
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Lungo turns the chair with yourself and Councilor Penta.

1512
01:58:28,887 --> 01:58:29,048
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

1513
01:58:29,308 --> 01:58:34,791
[SPEAKER_06]: I would ask the chair then if, uh, I think you would need at least two hours in a meeting like this.

1514
01:58:34,811 --> 01:58:40,996
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, cause I think sometimes in an hour you're hard pressed to get the questions and answers.

1515
01:58:41,076 --> 01:58:47,400
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, so I would ask that, uh, if my colleague would try to plan a two hour meeting on a Wednesday night.

1516
01:58:52,717 --> 01:58:59,880
[SPEAKER_11]: And if I may, from the chair, do you want to invite Mr. Hedgecock, I believe it is, the consultant, Woodcock.

1517
01:58:59,900 --> 01:59:03,081
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you want to invite him too, or just?

1518
01:59:03,561 --> 01:59:04,601
[SPEAKER_11]: And the DPW director.

1519
01:59:05,041 --> 01:59:11,384
[SPEAKER_06]: He's a paid consultant, so I think we're going to- Well, he came up with the rates, I'm sure, so.

1520
01:59:11,464 --> 01:59:13,124
[SPEAKER_11]: Whatever you guys decide.

1521
01:59:13,204 --> 01:59:17,406
[SPEAKER_11]: We're in great hands with Council Chairperson Lungo-Koehn.

1522
01:59:17,466 --> 01:59:20,107
[SPEAKER_11]: Roll call has been requested by Councilor Penta.

1523
01:59:26,623 --> 01:59:26,883
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1524
01:59:28,043 --> 01:59:28,224
Yes.

1525
01:59:30,804 --> 01:59:31,104
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1526
01:59:33,585 --> 01:59:33,805
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1527
01:59:33,865 --> 01:59:37,726
[SPEAKER_11]: By vote of seven in the affirmative, none in the negative, the motion passes as amended.

1528
01:59:38,686 --> 01:59:50,870
[SPEAKER_11]: Offered by Councilor Marks, be it resolved due to the two trip and fall accidents that resulted in personal injury at number 26 and number 53 Carolina Street that the sidewalks be replaced in the interest of public safety.

1529
01:59:51,910 --> 01:59:52,590
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Marks.

1530
01:59:53,070 --> 01:59:54,151
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1531
01:59:54,611 --> 01:59:55,771
[SPEAKER_06]: These were two separate

1532
01:59:56,127 --> 01:59:59,709
[SPEAKER_06]: trip-and-fall accidents on Carolina Street.

1533
02:00:00,430 --> 02:00:02,331
[SPEAKER_06]: One, the woman was taken to the hospital.

1534
02:00:02,711 --> 02:00:03,772
[SPEAKER_06]: She broke her nose.

1535
02:00:04,252 --> 02:00:05,993
[SPEAKER_06]: She did some damage to her jawbone.

1536
02:00:06,754 --> 02:00:08,035
[SPEAKER_06]: And the other woman fell down.

1537
02:00:08,095 --> 02:00:11,157
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe had some leg damage, Mr. President.

1538
02:00:11,197 --> 02:00:16,720
[SPEAKER_06]: But both sidewalks are above, actually, the curb.

1539
02:00:17,101 --> 02:00:25,406
[SPEAKER_06]: So when you step up onto the sidewalk, you hit the lip of the sidewalk, rather than just go onto a flat plane.

1540
02:00:26,002 --> 02:00:30,144
[SPEAKER_06]: And they really, in the interest of public safety, need to be done immediately, Mr. President.

1541
02:00:30,664 --> 02:00:32,584
[SPEAKER_11]: In the interest of public safety, all those in favor?

1542
02:00:32,604 --> 02:00:32,665
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

1543
02:00:33,945 --> 02:00:34,565
[SPEAKER_11]: All those opposed?

1544
02:00:34,605 --> 02:00:37,566
[SPEAKER_11]: Before the vote is taken, Vice President Caraviello.

1545
02:00:37,766 --> 02:00:38,887
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1546
02:00:39,447 --> 02:00:45,989
[SPEAKER_05]: This afternoon, I, myself along with Chief Sacco, walked some of the streets in South Medford today.

1547
02:00:46,069 --> 02:00:52,912
[SPEAKER_05]: And Yale Street, right at the beginning, is, from all the trucks driving on the sidewalk,

1548
02:00:53,413 --> 02:00:57,616
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all cracked and in deplorable condition, waiting for an accident.

1549
02:00:58,097 --> 02:01:00,099
[SPEAKER_05]: And the same thing with the corner of Harvard and Main.

1550
02:01:00,659 --> 02:01:02,140
[SPEAKER_05]: And the truck's driving on top of there.

1551
02:01:02,901 --> 02:01:04,302
[SPEAKER_05]: All the sidewalk is cracked there.

1552
02:01:04,382 --> 02:01:06,724
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, those are accidents waiting to happen, too.

1553
02:01:07,725 --> 02:01:13,830
[SPEAKER_05]: And one more spot, also in that same area, is the handicapped spot on Main Street.

1554
02:01:15,391 --> 02:01:17,673
[SPEAKER_05]: A woman fell there not too long ago and broke her hip.

1555
02:01:19,414 --> 02:01:22,537
[SPEAKER_05]: I happened to be there with a former firefighter, Raganoski.

1556
02:01:23,092 --> 02:01:26,033
[SPEAKER_05]: And help the woman to the hospital.

1557
02:01:26,793 --> 02:01:30,314
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, as amended by Vice President Caraviello, Councilor Knight.

1558
02:01:30,914 --> 02:01:32,235
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much, Mr. President.

1559
02:01:32,375 --> 02:01:42,578
[SPEAKER_03]: And Councilor Caraviello brought this up to my attention, actually, would be also Badger Road in Winthrop, where the Caliaco Construction Company's performing infrastructure improvements to our water and sewer pipes.

1560
02:01:42,618 --> 02:01:45,479
[SPEAKER_03]: They're driving over the sidewalk to use that piece of land as a layover land.

1561
02:01:45,939 --> 02:01:50,020
[SPEAKER_03]: And as such, they've caused extensive damage to the curb and siding over there.

1562
02:01:50,379 --> 02:01:54,743
[SPEAKER_03]: And I believe that's one of the safe routes to schools, Mr. President, so I think that's something that might also need to be looked at.

1563
02:01:55,484 --> 02:01:56,825
[SPEAKER_11]: Badger Road and Winthrop Street.

1564
02:01:58,147 --> 02:02:01,230
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion of Council of Mocks, as amended, all those in favor?

1565
02:02:01,250 --> 02:02:01,310
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

1566
02:02:01,890 --> 02:02:02,491
[SPEAKER_11]: All those opposed?

1567
02:02:02,511 --> 02:02:04,833
[SPEAKER_11]: The ayes have it.

1568
02:02:05,173 --> 02:02:06,895
[SPEAKER_11]: Item 14-689, offered by Council and Knight.

1569
02:02:07,376 --> 02:02:13,722
[SPEAKER_11]: Be it resolved, whereas October is National Disability Awareness Month, the Medford City Council invite Diane McLeod,

1570
02:02:14,602 --> 02:02:26,012
[SPEAKER_11]: Director of the Office on Disability and Human Rights Commission to appear before the body to provide an update on the services, programming, and progress that the city has made in regard to accessibility and equal opportunity.

1571
02:02:26,072 --> 02:02:26,612
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Knight.

1572
02:02:27,273 --> 02:02:28,614
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much, Mr. President.

1573
02:02:28,814 --> 02:02:33,498
[SPEAKER_03]: Where October is National Disability Awareness Month, I found this resolution to be fitting.

1574
02:02:34,131 --> 02:02:41,092
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a number of projects going on, a number of projects that have been completed, whether it's through community development block grant funds or otherwise.

1575
02:02:41,572 --> 02:02:45,333
[SPEAKER_03]: We're seeing park improvements and accessibility, sidewalk improvements for accessibility.

1576
02:02:45,353 --> 02:02:56,355
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd like the director of disability to have an opportunity to come down here and explain to us exactly what progress they've made over the last year or so in terms of improving accessibility and equal opportunity for the residents here in the city.

1577
02:02:57,116 --> 02:02:58,976
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion, all those in favor?

1578
02:02:59,844 --> 02:03:00,964
[SPEAKER_11]: All those opposed, the ayes have it.

1579
02:03:01,484 --> 02:03:04,225
[SPEAKER_11]: Item 14-691, offered by Councilor Knight.

1580
02:03:04,745 --> 02:03:14,168
[SPEAKER_11]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council extend a sincere congratulations to Joan Gatto and Jean and Topper on the birth of their newest grandchild, Benjamin David and Topper.

1581
02:03:14,388 --> 02:03:14,928
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Knight.

1582
02:03:15,348 --> 02:03:16,668
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much, Mr. President.

1583
02:03:16,868 --> 02:03:19,849
[SPEAKER_03]: There are two very proud grandparents in two separate parts of the city.

1584
02:03:20,476 --> 02:03:27,041
[SPEAKER_03]: Many of us know Joan Gatto from the magnificent Muffin and Bagel Shop, and right now I'm sure she's smiling with the birth of her newest grandson.

1585
02:03:27,801 --> 02:03:37,788
[SPEAKER_03]: As goes Jean Entapa from over in the hillside area of Medford, an employee at Tufts University, who brings, I believe, her third male grandson into the family.

1586
02:03:37,828 --> 02:03:39,129
[SPEAKER_03]: I think she has about six total.

1587
02:03:39,749 --> 02:03:45,493
[SPEAKER_03]: However, Benjamin David Entapa joins his sister Ava and his sister Callie.

1588
02:03:45,513 --> 02:03:48,495
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'd like to welcome her to the world and congratulate two proud grandparents, Mr. President.

1589
02:03:48,922 --> 02:03:52,903
[SPEAKER_11]: Congratulations on behalf of the entire council, submitted by Councilor Knight.

1590
02:03:52,943 --> 02:03:53,764
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1591
02:03:54,564 --> 02:03:55,304
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

1592
02:03:56,104 --> 02:03:56,724
[SPEAKER_11]: All those opposed?

1593
02:03:56,744 --> 02:03:58,125
[SPEAKER_11]: The ayes have it.

1594
02:03:58,245 --> 02:04:05,507
[SPEAKER_11]: Item 14-687, petition by Jeanne M. Martin, 10 Cummings Street, Medford, Mass., to address the council on police personnel.

1595
02:04:05,787 --> 02:04:05,947
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

1596
02:04:05,967 --> 02:04:06,247
[SPEAKER_11]: Martin.

1597
02:04:06,508 --> 02:04:06,848
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1598
02:04:07,128 --> 02:04:10,969
[SPEAKER_01]: Jeanne Martin, 10 Cummings Street, and I'd like to thank you all for giving me the opportunity to speak.

1599
02:04:11,448 --> 02:04:14,690
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the only public and open forum in the city that the city has.

1600
02:04:14,890 --> 02:04:15,490
[SPEAKER_01]: It really is.

1601
02:04:15,990 --> 02:04:29,417
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's to be appreciated every single day, because without this forum, this city would be in a total media blackout, really, with the exception of a couple of articles in the transcript, a couple of articles on the patch.

1602
02:04:29,898 --> 02:04:30,478
[SPEAKER_01]: But really,

1603
02:04:30,816 --> 02:04:31,356
[SPEAKER_01]: This is it.

1604
02:04:31,436 --> 02:04:36,438
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the one place where the people have an ability to have a voice.

1605
02:04:36,878 --> 02:04:42,699
[SPEAKER_01]: More people should use this forum when they have issues, when they have the issues of the water and sewer rates.

1606
02:04:43,260 --> 02:04:44,100
[SPEAKER_01]: They should be in here.

1607
02:04:44,720 --> 02:04:47,521
[SPEAKER_01]: And they shouldn't make you guys repeat the same thing.

1608
02:04:47,561 --> 02:04:51,262
[SPEAKER_01]: They should be here face after face, different face after different face.

1609
02:04:51,800 --> 02:04:53,321
[SPEAKER_01]: But that said, I'll leave that.

1610
02:04:53,961 --> 02:04:55,282
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have some things about personnel.

1611
02:04:57,203 --> 02:04:58,964
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Markson hit it on the head.

1612
02:04:59,504 --> 02:05:00,905
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a comprehensive problem.

1613
02:05:00,965 --> 02:05:10,070
[SPEAKER_01]: Policing is an absolutely, and Mr. Penta, and all of you, it's a comprehensive issue, and it's not gonna be solved just by increasing personnel.

1614
02:05:10,931 --> 02:05:14,212
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to do with the traffic patterns.

1615
02:05:15,093 --> 02:05:19,575
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to do with the demographic changes, and by that I mean prior to 2001,

1616
02:05:21,812 --> 02:05:26,335
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people that had a two-family house, one of those apartments was owned by the homeowner.

1617
02:05:27,215 --> 02:05:41,884
[SPEAKER_01]: We know by huge numbers, those two-family houses, when the old folks moved out, they sold it, and that property was used as rental income solely, as an investment and used as a business.

1618
02:05:42,705 --> 02:05:46,587
[SPEAKER_01]: There are so many two-family and three-family houses that are now businesses.

1619
02:05:48,148 --> 02:05:51,610
[SPEAKER_01]: What they sell is a home, an apartment,

1620
02:05:51,974 --> 02:05:52,714
[SPEAKER_01]: They sell apartments.

1621
02:05:53,854 --> 02:06:00,656
[SPEAKER_01]: It's no longer, you know, mom upstairs or dad downstairs or whatever and cousin or, you know, uncle.

1622
02:06:00,676 --> 02:06:02,896
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple left, but those are gone.

1623
02:06:03,397 --> 02:06:09,158
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of people that these two family houses, the person that owns the house doesn't live in the city.

1624
02:06:09,818 --> 02:06:11,318
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is a demographic change.

1625
02:06:12,198 --> 02:06:19,280
[SPEAKER_01]: And people that rent, I don't care what you say, people that rent do not feel that they have the same voice as I do, who's a homeowner.

1626
02:06:19,898 --> 02:06:25,179
[SPEAKER_01]: I can come up here and I can feel in charge of my life more because I have a stake in the city.

1627
02:06:25,619 --> 02:06:29,020
[SPEAKER_01]: People that rent have to answer to their landlords.

1628
02:06:29,880 --> 02:06:33,961
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they come up here and they make a big deal, their landlords may take it against them.

1629
02:06:34,402 --> 02:06:37,842
[SPEAKER_01]: They shouldn't, but, you know, life is life, and that's the way it is.

1630
02:06:38,402 --> 02:06:39,983
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've had demographic shifts.

1631
02:06:40,063 --> 02:06:42,103
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had racial demographic shifts.

1632
02:06:42,543 --> 02:06:44,504
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had a whole bunch of changes.

1633
02:06:45,137 --> 02:06:45,557
[SPEAKER_01]: in the city.

1634
02:06:45,878 --> 02:06:54,245
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the traffic issues have to be handled, the parking enforcement should be citywide, and it should be completely citywide.

1635
02:06:55,166 --> 02:07:03,673
[SPEAKER_01]: It should be for commercial, it should be for in front of hydrants, I don't care if you live in North Medford or West Medford, it should be completely citywide.

1636
02:07:04,094 --> 02:07:10,259
[SPEAKER_01]: Because what happens is you have favoritism, and I know I'm getting to personnel, but it's all part of the same problem.

1637
02:07:10,905 --> 02:07:18,132
[SPEAKER_01]: If you, if you can, you can hire 200 police officers, but if you don't take care of these other issues, they're going to be chasing their own tails.

1638
02:07:19,053 --> 02:07:20,595
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they're going to be chasing their own tail.

1639
02:07:20,635 --> 02:07:22,917
[SPEAKER_01]: So it has to be done comprehensively.

1640
02:07:23,458 --> 02:07:26,921
[SPEAKER_01]: And the building, he always talks about the building enforcement.

1641
02:07:27,982 --> 02:07:30,324
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it, that pays for itself.

1642
02:07:31,105 --> 02:07:32,026
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm all for that.

1643
02:07:32,206 --> 02:07:33,147
[SPEAKER_01]: That pays for itself.

1644
02:07:33,788 --> 02:07:34,789
[SPEAKER_01]: That guy or,

1645
02:07:35,319 --> 02:07:39,621
[SPEAKER_01]: girl or a couple of girls or guys can help with police enforcement.

1646
02:07:40,201 --> 02:07:42,623
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody knows how many cars there are on this street.

1647
02:07:43,063 --> 02:07:44,704
[SPEAKER_01]: And the average single family has two cars.

1648
02:07:45,144 --> 02:07:47,365
[SPEAKER_01]: The average two family is going to have four cars.

1649
02:07:48,105 --> 02:07:55,229
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that's the way it is, unless they're really right on top of the T. But they all know that because you pay an excise tax.

1650
02:07:55,929 --> 02:08:00,151
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of those issues, it should be handled not in a vacuum.

1651
02:08:00,191 --> 02:08:01,212
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody talked about a vacuum.

1652
02:08:01,252 --> 02:08:02,452
[SPEAKER_01]: It shouldn't be handled in a vacuum.

1653
02:08:02,792 --> 02:08:03,873
[SPEAKER_01]: It should be all inclusive.

1654
02:08:04,423 --> 02:08:06,104
[SPEAKER_01]: And it should be done properly.

1655
02:08:06,665 --> 02:08:08,306
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately, we're behind the eight ball.

1656
02:08:08,346 --> 02:08:10,087
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been behind the eight ball on parking.

1657
02:08:10,367 --> 02:08:12,649
[SPEAKER_01]: There should have been meters in the squares a long time ago.

1658
02:08:12,989 --> 02:08:14,090
[SPEAKER_01]: There should have been enforcement.

1659
02:08:14,130 --> 02:08:16,191
[SPEAKER_01]: We could say that shoulda, shoulda, woulda, coulda.

1660
02:08:17,112 --> 02:08:21,415
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't do us any good because it's water under the dam now.

1661
02:08:21,495 --> 02:08:22,616
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to move from here.

1662
02:08:23,294 --> 02:08:25,675
[SPEAKER_01]: and do the best we can with the contract assignment.

1663
02:08:26,216 --> 02:08:27,256
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to have to tweak it.

1664
02:08:27,296 --> 02:08:28,117
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have to back.

1665
02:08:28,777 --> 02:08:29,518
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be a mess.

1666
02:08:30,558 --> 02:08:31,779
[SPEAKER_01]: It might end up to be a mess.

1667
02:08:32,579 --> 02:08:36,702
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're going to have to work with that mess and then move forward from there, because something had to be done.

1668
02:08:37,182 --> 02:08:39,523
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, it wasn't done 5, 10 years ago when it should have been.

1669
02:08:40,224 --> 02:08:42,345
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's where we are today, and that's what we have to accept.

1670
02:08:42,885 --> 02:08:43,826
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so thank you for that.

1671
02:08:45,347 --> 02:08:48,388
[SPEAKER_01]: First, we only have 105 officers for a city of 57,000.

1672
02:08:48,508 --> 02:08:53,071
[SPEAKER_01]: It is ridiculous, given the proximity to Boston.

1673
02:08:54,063 --> 02:08:56,525
[SPEAKER_01]: 120 is a reasonable amount to start with.

1674
02:08:57,226 --> 02:09:06,814
[SPEAKER_01]: Community policing is also the only way you are going to increase visibility and build trust in neighborhoods which have large rental populations and or minority populations.

1675
02:09:07,735 --> 02:09:12,019
[SPEAKER_01]: Walking the beat, not sitting idle in a cruiser, will create trust.

1676
02:09:13,180 --> 02:09:15,782
[SPEAKER_01]: I would propose having them walk in pairs of two.

1677
02:09:16,583 --> 02:09:19,325
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have to work together, but in the square in that area.

1678
02:09:20,246 --> 02:09:21,347
[SPEAKER_01]: One over here, one over there.

1679
02:09:21,806 --> 02:09:24,167
[SPEAKER_01]: They could break up, but they need backup.

1680
02:09:25,388 --> 02:09:27,690
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, we don't live in a nice world anymore.

1681
02:09:28,090 --> 02:09:33,573
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they need to have somebody available within a shout for their own safety.

1682
02:09:36,875 --> 02:09:39,817
[SPEAKER_01]: People don't want to accept this, but that's the world we live in.

1683
02:09:39,877 --> 02:09:41,338
[SPEAKER_01]: Walking the beat, okay.

1684
02:09:42,458 --> 02:09:45,941
[SPEAKER_01]: Night shift not included, but certainly days and evenings to 11 p.m.

1685
02:09:46,943 --> 02:09:49,144
[SPEAKER_01]: We should have people out of their cars.

1686
02:09:49,644 --> 02:09:54,265
[SPEAKER_01]: Because one of the worst things, the perceptions of the police is they're sitting idle in a cruiser.

1687
02:09:55,065 --> 02:09:56,006
[SPEAKER_01]: People hate that.

1688
02:09:56,066 --> 02:09:56,946
[SPEAKER_01]: They tell me all the time.

1689
02:09:57,326 --> 02:09:58,086
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, why should I care?

1690
02:09:58,126 --> 02:10:02,227
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they're sitting, look at them, they're playing with their phones in the cruiser, idle, idle.

1691
02:10:02,548 --> 02:10:03,668
[SPEAKER_01]: It's different when they're driving around.

1692
02:10:04,448 --> 02:10:06,630
[SPEAKER_01]: They look busy when they're driving the neighborhoods.

1693
02:10:07,170 --> 02:10:08,371
[SPEAKER_01]: But the perception matters.

1694
02:10:09,031 --> 02:10:10,612
[SPEAKER_01]: Perception will decrease crime.

1695
02:10:11,433 --> 02:10:12,874
[SPEAKER_01]: They might be busy doing something.

1696
02:10:12,914 --> 02:10:17,677
[SPEAKER_01]: They might be reading about a client, you know, testimony that they're going to be given in a court.

1697
02:10:18,198 --> 02:10:19,018
[SPEAKER_01]: But they don't know that.

1698
02:10:19,058 --> 02:10:20,740
[SPEAKER_01]: The person, you know, doesn't know that.

1699
02:10:21,560 --> 02:10:22,901
[SPEAKER_01]: And that perception matters.

1700
02:10:23,802 --> 02:10:26,464
[SPEAKER_01]: Second, we are underutilizing trained officers.

1701
02:10:26,904 --> 02:10:30,787
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have and we're boring them to death on details.

1702
02:10:31,690 --> 02:10:37,852
[SPEAKER_01]: In the name of a 15% kickback, nobody wants to talk about this, it's a sore spot for the city.

1703
02:10:39,773 --> 02:10:43,874
[SPEAKER_01]: National Grid pays us for that detail.

1704
02:10:44,274 --> 02:10:52,697
[SPEAKER_01]: We rent out our cops, we rent out our police officers to stand over that hole, whether it's National Grid, Comcast, whatever it might be, and we rent them out.

1705
02:10:52,737 --> 02:10:57,459
[SPEAKER_01]: We like that because that's where they make their extra money so we don't have to pay them higher salaries.

1706
02:10:58,199 --> 02:10:59,379
[SPEAKER_01]: They deserve higher salaries.

1707
02:10:59,479 --> 02:11:01,000
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they should just have higher salaries.

1708
02:11:02,165 --> 02:11:06,987
[SPEAKER_01]: But the way the mayor gets around that is he has them work a detail.

1709
02:11:07,427 --> 02:11:19,592
[SPEAKER_01]: And the real frosting on the cake for us is not only does the city save money by giving them the details so that they don't have to pay them a higher salary,

1710
02:11:20,572 --> 02:11:23,793
[SPEAKER_01]: The frosting is that we get a 15% kickback.

1711
02:11:24,154 --> 02:11:27,195
[SPEAKER_01]: We get 15% back on that detail.

1712
02:11:27,555 --> 02:11:33,698
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that might have been fine in 1980 in Medford, but it's not suitable to use our cops that way.

1713
02:11:33,738 --> 02:11:34,498
[SPEAKER_01]: We're burning them out.

1714
02:11:34,538 --> 02:11:35,539
[SPEAKER_01]: We're boring them to death.

1715
02:11:35,879 --> 02:11:36,719
[SPEAKER_01]: They're on their phones.

1716
02:11:36,759 --> 02:11:38,340
[SPEAKER_01]: They're looking at their phones.

1717
02:11:39,240 --> 02:11:40,261
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're standing over the hole.

1718
02:11:40,301 --> 02:11:44,383
[SPEAKER_01]: The job is to protect the workers, not to really police the traffic.

1719
02:11:45,236 --> 02:11:45,937
[SPEAKER_01]: People don't know that.

1720
02:11:45,957 --> 02:11:48,539
[SPEAKER_01]: They think that they're there for the traffic, but they're really there to protect.

1721
02:11:48,719 --> 02:11:51,802
[SPEAKER_01]: They're being paid by National Grid to protect the workers of National Grid.

1722
02:11:52,323 --> 02:11:53,624
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I— Not at all.

1723
02:11:53,644 --> 02:11:53,924
[SPEAKER_01]: Too long?

1724
02:11:54,345 --> 02:11:54,745
[SPEAKER_11]: Continue.

1725
02:11:54,985 --> 02:11:55,146
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1726
02:11:56,713 --> 02:12:08,799
[SPEAKER_01]: Federal, let me see here, okay, for the average observer, their experience of seeing a Medford police officer standing over the hole is the worst thing that we can do for perception.

1727
02:12:09,439 --> 02:12:11,600
[SPEAKER_01]: This does not create sympathy for the officers.

1728
02:12:12,321 --> 02:12:18,264
[SPEAKER_01]: The mayor doesn't stop, if the mayor doesn't stop that practice because of the loss of their revenue.

1729
02:12:18,504 --> 02:12:19,204
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I talked about that.

1730
02:12:19,619 --> 02:12:28,084
[SPEAKER_01]: Federal deficits and debt are going to continue to climb in the grant-rich environment that was once in abundance will continue to dry up.

1731
02:12:28,605 --> 02:12:32,427
[SPEAKER_01]: School aid and community aid programs will fall short of their previous numbers.

1732
02:12:32,947 --> 02:12:41,993
[SPEAKER_01]: Sooner rather than later, the old fight will ensue over hiring to keep a classroom size down or to hire a police officer.

1733
02:12:42,773 --> 02:12:45,475
[SPEAKER_01]: The police officer loses to a kid every time.

1734
02:12:46,673 --> 02:12:53,476
[SPEAKER_01]: Yet if one of these kids comes in school with a knife or a gun, who will they call but a cop, a police officer?

1735
02:12:54,076 --> 02:12:55,997
[SPEAKER_01]: And that cop won't be there for your kid.

1736
02:12:59,319 --> 02:13:05,481
[SPEAKER_01]: If the people of the city do not get in front of the crime and safety, it will consume more lives.

1737
02:13:06,002 --> 02:13:07,662
[SPEAKER_01]: Wishing in a way will not make it so.

1738
02:13:08,603 --> 02:13:10,463
[SPEAKER_01]: Building code enforcement, I talked about that.

1739
02:13:11,324 --> 02:13:15,886
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I'm going to talk about another topic that is hard to handle, illegal immigrants.

1740
02:13:17,412 --> 02:13:27,115
[SPEAKER_01]: Illegal immigrants both live inside city limits and enter the city limits every day to shingle a roof, to paint a room, to cut grass, or clean a house.

1741
02:13:27,955 --> 02:13:30,195
[SPEAKER_01]: The police, if no others— Ms.

1742
02:13:30,215 --> 02:13:33,716
[SPEAKER_11]: Martin, can I just remind you that you're here to talk about the police personnel?

1743
02:13:34,096 --> 02:13:34,437
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.

1744
02:13:34,697 --> 02:13:34,897
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1745
02:13:35,217 --> 02:13:35,657
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's right.

1746
02:13:35,857 --> 02:13:36,517
[SPEAKER_01]: You got a point there.

1747
02:13:37,017 --> 02:13:37,197
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1748
02:13:37,777 --> 02:13:38,218
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, anyway.

1749
02:13:38,718 --> 02:13:40,298
[SPEAKER_01]: But, well, it is the police.

1750
02:13:40,718 --> 02:13:43,039
[SPEAKER_01]: It is the police because the police, if no others,

1751
02:13:44,395 --> 02:13:47,156
[SPEAKER_01]: should have the right to know that they are living here or coming here.

1752
02:13:49,077 --> 02:13:54,539
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they, too, suffer from domestic violence, sex trafficking, or gang violence.

1753
02:13:56,080 --> 02:13:57,980
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's in their own interest as well as us.

1754
02:13:59,101 --> 02:14:01,402
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever the policy is, they're here.

1755
02:14:02,222 --> 02:14:03,263
[SPEAKER_01]: And how are we going to deal with them?

1756
02:14:03,703 --> 02:14:09,285
[SPEAKER_01]: And the police, I don't need to know they're here, but the police need to know they're here.

1757
02:14:11,834 --> 02:14:17,899
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, police officers are authorized to use deadly force and therefore need to be in check with their emotions at all times.

1758
02:14:18,640 --> 02:14:26,206
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to ensure an absolute locked record for therapy for those officers seeking help before they do something unhealthy to themselves or others.

1759
02:14:27,086 --> 02:14:31,190
[SPEAKER_01]: To think that they can do their jobs and not be impacted by it is ludicrous.

1760
02:14:31,890 --> 02:14:36,274
[SPEAKER_01]: However, should they act out in violence inappropriately toward family or others,

1761
02:14:36,667 --> 02:14:42,229
[SPEAKER_01]: They should be monitored closely and held to a higher standard because they have the authority to use lethal force.

1762
02:14:42,529 --> 02:14:42,669
[SPEAKER_01]: Ms.

1763
02:14:42,689 --> 02:14:53,552
[SPEAKER_11]: Martin, I don't want to cut you off, but some of these things you're talking about, the police department does deal with these very specific on very limited occasions when it does happen.

1764
02:14:54,692 --> 02:14:58,633
[SPEAKER_11]: To make the inception that the police don't deal with any... Oh, no, no, no.

1765
02:14:58,813 --> 02:14:59,433
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying that.

1766
02:14:59,873 --> 02:15:03,694
[SPEAKER_11]: I just think we're going down a slippery road where we're painting a pigeon.

1767
02:15:03,714 --> 02:15:04,695
[SPEAKER_11]: You're entitled to your opinion.

1768
02:15:06,601 --> 02:15:08,244
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, no offense, I have a right to say it.

1769
02:15:08,625 --> 02:15:14,556
[SPEAKER_11]: You have a right to address the city council when what the council president deems in people's business.

1770
02:15:15,407 --> 02:15:16,407
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the people's business.

1771
02:15:16,807 --> 02:15:24,050
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you don't have enough officers and you don't treat them right, if we don't treat the officers right, then they are more inclined to have that stress build up.

1772
02:15:24,390 --> 02:15:25,510
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't strike.

1773
02:15:26,511 --> 02:15:27,291
[SPEAKER_01]: They cannot strike.

1774
02:15:27,331 --> 02:15:28,591
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do they relieve that stress?

1775
02:15:29,452 --> 02:15:30,532
[SPEAKER_01]: It builds up and it builds up.

1776
02:15:30,892 --> 02:15:34,433
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes out on somebody on the street, comes out some way.

1777
02:15:34,493 --> 02:15:40,275
[SPEAKER_11]: And they also have an EAP program that's sponsored by the city of Medford, which is open to all employees.

1778
02:15:41,176 --> 02:15:41,336
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1779
02:15:41,356 --> 02:15:42,416
[SPEAKER_11]: If they feel the need for it.

1780
02:15:42,656 --> 02:15:43,537
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying they don't.

1781
02:15:43,577 --> 02:15:43,957
[SPEAKER_01]: They should.

1782
02:15:44,277 --> 02:15:44,737
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's great.

1783
02:15:45,834 --> 02:15:47,235
[SPEAKER_11]: Point of information, Councilor Knight.

1784
02:15:47,535 --> 02:16:08,452
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that it's important to point out that all the officers in our department are appropriately trained and the Chief of Police has implemented a number of programs as required by state law and otherwise to ensure the safety of our officers and to ensure the fact that the general public is protected and that, you know, these personnel issues that occur.

1785
02:16:09,196 --> 02:16:12,958
[SPEAKER_03]: in any organization, within any organization, not just within the police department.

1786
02:16:13,658 --> 02:16:22,263
[SPEAKER_03]: So although I appreciate what you're saying, I think that, you know, we're getting a little off base here in terms of, maybe you're losing me here, I'm just trying to figure out what direction you're trying to go in there.

1787
02:16:22,303 --> 02:16:27,625
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe if you could, you know, you're talking about staffing levels, you're talking about programming, I'm a little confused as to where you're going here.

1788
02:16:27,645 --> 02:16:28,386
[SPEAKER_03]: All of the above.

1789
02:16:28,406 --> 02:16:29,826
[SPEAKER_01]: It is just, I'm sorry, can I?

1790
02:16:29,886 --> 02:16:30,387
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, please.

1791
02:16:30,787 --> 02:16:31,387
[SPEAKER_01]: All of the above.

1792
02:16:31,467 --> 02:16:34,849
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a comprehensive program, and we know

1793
02:16:35,950 --> 02:16:42,134
[SPEAKER_01]: that when you put someone under that kind of stress and you give them that much authority, they can abuse that authority.

1794
02:16:42,514 --> 02:16:43,455
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying they should.

1795
02:16:43,775 --> 02:16:44,575
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying they will.

1796
02:16:44,895 --> 02:16:50,139
[SPEAKER_01]: But I am saying that if you continue to put them under pressure, everybody has a snapping point.

1797
02:16:50,919 --> 02:16:55,642
[SPEAKER_01]: And we should really build up any kind of training program.

1798
02:16:56,229 --> 02:16:58,630
[SPEAKER_01]: We should add more to it so that doesn't happen.

1799
02:16:58,970 --> 02:17:02,572
[SPEAKER_01]: Because this city is turning more and more into an urban environment.

1800
02:17:02,612 --> 02:17:04,133
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going suburban.

1801
02:17:04,193 --> 02:17:05,154
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going more urban.

1802
02:17:05,834 --> 02:17:09,236
[SPEAKER_01]: And we need to be on top of that before something happens.

1803
02:17:09,956 --> 02:17:12,237
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just feel very strongly about that.

1804
02:17:12,597 --> 02:17:19,601
[SPEAKER_01]: So I understand you want to, you know, I understand that the police have programs, but we really need to be on top of that.

1805
02:17:20,580 --> 02:17:24,103
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to increase the numbers, and I don't want to misuse them.

1806
02:17:24,523 --> 02:17:24,864
[SPEAKER_11]: We all do.

1807
02:17:25,464 --> 02:17:26,425
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I agree with that.

1808
02:17:26,905 --> 02:17:27,406
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, thank you.

1809
02:17:28,907 --> 02:17:32,389
[SPEAKER_11]: And if I may, just one point from the chair on the details.

1810
02:17:33,850 --> 02:17:44,038
[SPEAKER_11]: Any details that are in the West Medford area, when something happens at Medford High School that's a serious situation, it will be additional bodies that were not working in the city of Medford responding to a catastrophic event.

1811
02:17:44,358 --> 02:17:49,522
[SPEAKER_11]: So the details provide a tremendous value to the people in this community, not monetary,

1812
02:17:50,029 --> 02:17:52,030
[SPEAKER_11]: but public safety-wise, as far as I'm concerned.

1813
02:17:52,871 --> 02:17:53,772
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Dello Russo.

1814
02:17:53,972 --> 02:17:56,373
[SPEAKER_02]: Just an interesting statistic, Mr. President.

1815
02:17:56,534 --> 02:18:10,223
[SPEAKER_02]: According to the official directory of 1950 for the Massachusetts Police Association, Medford at that time had a chief, two captains, five lieutenants, 10 sergeants, and 93 patrolmen.

1816
02:18:12,325 --> 02:18:13,125
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1817
02:18:13,585 --> 02:18:14,086
[SPEAKER_11]: More than today.

1818
02:18:16,243 --> 02:18:17,424
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would want to say one more thing.

1819
02:18:17,864 --> 02:18:21,446
[SPEAKER_01]: The people of Medford should be here saying what I'm saying.

1820
02:18:21,926 --> 02:18:27,309
[SPEAKER_01]: They should be here again petitioning for more police officers for the very reasons that I laid out.

1821
02:18:27,690 --> 02:18:35,874
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe you didn't agree with all my reasons, but it doesn't matter because I'm a person and a city person, a citizen, and I represent some of those people.

1822
02:18:36,194 --> 02:18:36,935
[SPEAKER_01]: I represent myself.

1823
02:18:37,375 --> 02:18:39,957
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I'm one out of 57,000, that's my choice.

1824
02:18:41,598 --> 02:18:41,898
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1825
02:18:42,318 --> 02:18:43,559
[SPEAKER_11]: Just to play the devil's advocate?

1826
02:18:43,739 --> 02:18:43,899
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

1827
02:18:44,178 --> 02:18:50,402
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe there's not a lot of people here because there are many people in this community out of that 57,000 that think we have one of the best police departments around.

1828
02:18:51,623 --> 02:18:52,524
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

1829
02:18:52,904 --> 02:18:55,146
[SPEAKER_00]: Just briefly, thank you, President Camuso.

1830
02:18:55,446 --> 02:19:02,331
[SPEAKER_00]: Gene, I agree with you on the community policing and getting back to the community policing, which we used to do years ago.

1831
02:19:02,911 --> 02:19:04,192
[SPEAKER_00]: So I agree with you on that point.

1832
02:19:04,232 --> 02:19:11,417
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that the chief of police is going to have the first walk in South Medford with the neighbors sometime, I think, late next week.

1833
02:19:13,174 --> 02:19:21,579
[SPEAKER_00]: council recommendation and that's a start and hopefully he does that within the different neighborhoods in the community as a start back to going back to community policing.

1834
02:19:22,139 --> 02:19:22,459
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1835
02:19:24,160 --> 02:19:24,881
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Marks.

1836
02:19:26,602 --> 02:19:27,582
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1837
02:19:28,263 --> 02:19:34,866
[SPEAKER_06]: As we all know, and Jean's been very vocal over the years, Jean has been a staunch advocate of the police department.

1838
02:19:35,307 --> 02:19:41,390
[SPEAKER_06]: So even though her statements went in many different directions, I think where it lies with Jean is

1839
02:19:41,800 --> 02:19:45,682
[SPEAKER_06]: She's always been a supporter of public safety and the men and women in the police department.

1840
02:19:46,142 --> 02:20:00,810
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, Mr. President, while we have her here, and I know it's getting late, but Jean has attended a meeting in Washington and has done yeoman's work on all sorts of disability issues and VA issues.

1841
02:20:01,450 --> 02:20:02,771
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'd like to hear- Councilor Marks?

1842
02:20:03,331 --> 02:20:05,032
[SPEAKER_11]: If I may, on housekeeping, same as last week.

1843
02:20:05,212 --> 02:20:05,713
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right.

1844
02:20:05,753 --> 02:20:08,534
[SPEAKER_11]: Receive and place on file the paper before us on the police station.

1845
02:20:09,575 --> 02:20:10,195
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

1846
02:20:11,144 --> 02:20:11,884
[SPEAKER_11]: All those opposed?

1847
02:20:13,265 --> 02:20:14,406
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion is received and placed on file.

1848
02:20:14,426 --> 02:20:16,046
[SPEAKER_11]: The chair recognizes Councilor Marks.

1849
02:20:17,067 --> 02:20:26,392
[SPEAKER_06]: I just would like, Mr. President, if Jane could fill us in on her endeavors with the VA and the disabilities and what she just recently did in Washington.

1850
02:20:26,572 --> 02:20:26,932
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1851
02:20:27,032 --> 02:20:27,592
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.

1852
02:20:28,913 --> 02:20:33,515
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to the Washington Disabled Americans for Life Memorial this weekend.

1853
02:20:33,555 --> 02:20:34,155
[SPEAKER_01]: It was beautiful.

1854
02:20:34,175 --> 02:20:34,676
[SPEAKER_01]: It was wonderful.

1855
02:20:34,696 --> 02:20:35,096
[SPEAKER_01]: It was great.

1856
02:20:35,456 --> 02:20:40,339
[SPEAKER_01]: The sky was blue, it was fantastic.

1857
02:20:40,359 --> 02:20:47,903
[SPEAKER_01]: 2,300 people were there, and most of them were disabled veterans and their wives and husbands.

1858
02:20:48,043 --> 02:20:49,064
[SPEAKER_01]: President Obama spoke.

1859
02:20:49,624 --> 02:20:53,046
[SPEAKER_01]: He was very sober when he spoke because, anyway, he was very sober.

1860
02:20:54,446 --> 02:20:59,009
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a couple of unique stories, which is Jesse Brown, who was a disabled veteran,

1861
02:20:59,549 --> 02:21:01,390
[SPEAKER_01]: African American veteran.

1862
02:21:02,651 --> 02:21:08,793
[SPEAKER_01]: The Vietnam veterans, because of Agent Orange, are dying at rapid rates compared to their World War II counterparts.

1863
02:21:09,153 --> 02:21:10,734
[SPEAKER_01]: He was 68 years old when he died.

1864
02:21:12,535 --> 02:21:14,536
[SPEAKER_01]: He started this project in 1998.

1865
02:21:15,676 --> 02:21:18,397
[SPEAKER_01]: He did not live to see the fruition of his labors.

1866
02:21:19,198 --> 02:21:28,862
[SPEAKER_01]: And another man, Sinise, Gary Sinise, who played Lieutenant Dan in the movie Forrest Gump,

1867
02:21:29,520 --> 02:21:30,260
[SPEAKER_01]: was an advocate.

1868
02:21:30,520 --> 02:21:33,961
[SPEAKER_01]: His brother-in-law, he was touched by the story of his brother-in-law in the 1970s.

1869
02:21:34,362 --> 02:21:39,083
[SPEAKER_01]: His brother-in-law died this week at 68 of cancers related to Agent Orange.

1870
02:21:40,764 --> 02:21:41,384
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was sad.

1871
02:21:42,344 --> 02:21:45,065
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a woman that was a sponsor.

1872
02:21:45,085 --> 02:21:47,846
[SPEAKER_01]: She paid $10 million out of her own pocket for this.

1873
02:21:48,766 --> 02:21:57,969
[SPEAKER_01]: In the 1960s, she was a musical dancer in New York, in Times Square, and all that.

1874
02:21:58,436 --> 02:22:03,158
[SPEAKER_01]: and she was asked to sing to the troops in the VA.

1875
02:22:03,679 --> 02:22:04,199
[SPEAKER_01]: She went there.

1876
02:22:04,239 --> 02:22:05,680
[SPEAKER_01]: She was devastated from what she saw.

1877
02:22:06,340 --> 02:22:12,403
[SPEAKER_01]: She was singing the song in West Side Story, Take My Hand and We'll Be Halfway There.

1878
02:22:12,783 --> 02:22:15,124
[SPEAKER_01]: She went to reach out for a soldier's hand and it wasn't there.

1879
02:22:15,685 --> 02:22:17,286
[SPEAKER_01]: She said that if she could ever do anything,

1880
02:22:18,692 --> 02:22:20,714
[SPEAKER_01]: In her lifetime, she would, and she did.

1881
02:22:21,114 --> 02:22:22,135
[SPEAKER_01]: She donated $10 million.

1882
02:22:22,255 --> 02:22:24,077
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a beautiful story.

1883
02:22:24,557 --> 02:22:32,103
[SPEAKER_01]: And the DAV fundraising that we did the other week was $1,300, a little over $1,300 for the one weekend.

1884
02:22:32,464 --> 02:22:37,428
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would like to thank, and I would like to announce that that is not the DAV's money, that is veterans' money.

1885
02:22:37,968 --> 02:22:46,956
[SPEAKER_01]: And if anybody has a Meffitt resident or a spouse or a child of a disabled veteran, they are all qualified

1886
02:22:47,540 --> 02:22:51,961
[SPEAKER_01]: to receive help in the form of an electric bill, heat bill.

1887
02:22:52,361 --> 02:22:57,603
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have a widow that is having a hard time, you have them call me and I can help them.

1888
02:22:57,703 --> 02:22:58,923
[SPEAKER_01]: I will not give them the money.

1889
02:22:59,424 --> 02:23:01,724
[SPEAKER_01]: I can pay the bill for them.

1890
02:23:02,285 --> 02:23:02,985
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's with that $1,300.

1891
02:23:04,452 --> 02:23:07,034
[SPEAKER_01]: And that money is for all Medford residents.

1892
02:23:07,514 --> 02:23:09,816
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be used for others, but it's for Medford residents.

1893
02:23:09,856 --> 02:23:13,879
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a veteran that can't make it to the hospital, call me and we can help pay.

1894
02:23:14,559 --> 02:23:25,287
[SPEAKER_01]: We can also do food by giving them a Stop and Shop gift card or some kind of, we can't give them the money, but we can go to Stop and Shop and can you give us a voucher for $50, $100, whatever.

1895
02:23:25,947 --> 02:23:27,829
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can do that with that money, so thank you.

1896
02:23:28,549 --> 02:23:30,210
[SPEAKER_11]: Would you like to give your number out or not at this time?

1897
02:23:30,230 --> 02:23:31,251
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure, absolutely.

1898
02:23:31,271 --> 02:23:31,311
[SPEAKER_01]: 781-395-7942.

1899
02:23:34,603 --> 02:23:34,843
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm 7946.

1900
02:23:34,883 --> 02:23:37,044
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I'm 7946.

1901
02:23:37,384 --> 02:23:40,345
[SPEAKER_11]: I have the same phone number almost.

1902
02:23:40,405 --> 02:23:50,668
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President, I just would like to thank Jean on behalf of all Method residents for her work and diligence with the DAV and all the great things that she does.

1903
02:23:51,408 --> 02:23:52,688
[SPEAKER_06]: That was very interesting to hear.

1904
02:23:52,708 --> 02:23:53,229

[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

1912
02:24:04,052 --> 02:24:05,173
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a quick announcement.

02:24:05,233 --> 02:24:05,593
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1915
02:24:07,034 --> 02:24:07,915
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's late.

1916
02:24:09,015 --> 02:24:16,461
[SPEAKER_00]: We had discussed last week, I brought a, put a resolution on the agenda with regards to our housing authorities being hooked up with FIOS.

1917
02:24:16,981 --> 02:24:20,564
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I got complaints about Tamponi Manor not having FIOS.

1918
02:24:20,624 --> 02:24:22,605
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did receive a resolve.

1919
02:24:22,645 --> 02:24:26,468
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know two people that did complain to me, watched the council meeting.

1920
02:24:26,508 --> 02:24:29,410
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I could just read it, I was recently, this is,

1921
02:24:30,157 --> 02:24:43,390
[SPEAKER_00]: From John Coddington, Medford Housing Authority to the Mayor's Office, who thankfully forwarded to us the email reads, I was recently approached by the firm hired by Verizon and charged with wiring the city for Fios.

1922
02:24:44,031 --> 02:24:52,419
[SPEAKER_00]: He sent us some material and I had staff meet with him yesterday about the possibility of wiring our nine MHA public housing sites.

1923
02:24:53,570 --> 02:25:02,473
[SPEAKER_00]: We, as in John Coddington, now plan to visit the Malden Housing Authority to see the quality of their installation work and to talk with them about their experience with the whole process.

1924
02:25:03,133 --> 02:25:11,816
[SPEAKER_00]: If things look acceptable, the next step would be to have the engineers come up with a scope of work and a plan for wiring our 845 apartments.

1925
02:25:12,537 --> 02:25:17,639
[SPEAKER_00]: They indicated they would like everything worked out by the end of the year, so the actual site work could be completed in 2015.

1926
02:25:19,639 --> 02:25:22,320
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thinking we'll know more within the next four to six weeks.

1927
02:25:22,540 --> 02:25:23,780
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope this information helps.

1928
02:25:24,360 --> 02:25:36,544
[SPEAKER_00]: So the 845 units within the Medford Housing Authority, just wanna confirm that Verizon, hopefully Verizon will be installed in 2015 and Mr. Coddington is working on it.

1929
02:25:36,644 --> 02:25:40,486
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thank the mayor's office again for getting us a response on this.

1930
02:25:41,206 --> 02:25:42,646
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for your due diligence.
