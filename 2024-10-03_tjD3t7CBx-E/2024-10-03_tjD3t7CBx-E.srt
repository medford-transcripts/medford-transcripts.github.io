[SPEAKER_08]: Seven present, none absent.

18
00:02:10,819 --> 00:02:12,020
[SPEAKER_08]: Meeting is called to order.

19
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,581
[SPEAKER_08]: Since we're in hybrid mode, we will have all roll call votes.

20
00:02:18,515 --> 00:02:22,679
[SPEAKER_08]: 24473 presented by Mayor Brianna Locurn, Capital Stabilization Fund appropriation request.

21
00:02:22,779 --> 00:02:24,761
[SPEAKER_08]: And we have a revised letter from today.

22
00:02:24,781 --> 00:02:33,569
[SPEAKER_08]: Dear President Bears and members of the city council, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approves the following appropriations from the Capital Stabilization Fund.

23
00:02:34,189 --> 00:02:36,451
[SPEAKER_08]: Replacement of the water heater at Brooks Elementary School, $267,000.

24
00:02:36,491 --> 00:02:37,512
[SPEAKER_08]: Roadway patching in the amount of $112,728.

25
00:02:44,676 --> 00:02:48,698
[SPEAKER_08]: replacement of light poles in city parking lots in the amount of $105,000.

26
00:02:49,478 --> 00:02:56,122
[SPEAKER_08]: City Hall elevator repair unforeseen costs and upgrades of electrical and fire alarm systems needed for code compliance, 75,000.

27
00:02:56,162 --> 00:03:04,105
[SPEAKER_08]: Repairs at Brooks Estate, use of funds must comply with city procurement policies and procedures and state procurement law in the amount of 55,000.

28
00:03:04,146 --> 00:03:09,288
[SPEAKER_08]: As your honorable body knows, the capital stabilization fund currently has a balance of $4,538,465 given the appropriations made

29
00:03:13,863 --> 00:03:15,484
[SPEAKER_08]: on September 17th, 2024.

30
00:03:16,145 --> 00:03:22,570
[SPEAKER_08]: If all of the above are approved, the capital stabilization fund would have $3,923,737 that remains.

31
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:27,233
[SPEAKER_08]: Any appropriation from the stabilization account requires a two-thirds majority vote of the City Council.

32
00:03:27,834 --> 00:03:34,479
[SPEAKER_08]: At the City Council's Committee of the Whole meeting on Wednesday, October 2nd, Assistant Superintendent Peter Cushing will be available for questions on the water heater replacement.

33
00:03:35,054 --> 00:03:38,877
[SPEAKER_08]: City Engineer Owen Wartella will be here for the roadway and patching project.

34
00:03:39,357 --> 00:03:44,560
[SPEAKER_08]: Superintendent of Ours, Steven Randazzo on the light poles and Facilities Director Paul Riggi on the elevator project.

35
00:03:45,381 --> 00:03:46,822
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for your kind attention to this matter.

36
00:03:46,882 --> 00:03:49,623
[SPEAKER_08]: Respectfully submitted, Brianna Longo Kern, Mayor.

37
00:03:50,844 --> 00:03:54,327
[SPEAKER_08]: And we will not be talking about the engine three pump right now.

38
00:03:54,387 --> 00:03:59,070
[SPEAKER_08]: That's looking like they're going to need to reassess the project and the cost for that.

39
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:01,131
[SPEAKER_08]: So that is not on the table right now.

40
00:04:02,366 --> 00:04:11,034
[SPEAKER_08]: given where we're at, just wanted to see if anyone had any questions before we move into discussion of individual items.

41
00:04:11,134 --> 00:04:12,636
[SPEAKER_08]: I see Councilor Scarpelli.

42
00:04:13,997 --> 00:04:14,978
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Council President.

43
00:04:15,559 --> 00:04:16,099
[SPEAKER_12]: Quick question.

44
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:20,784
[SPEAKER_12]: Is there anybody from the administration available to speak?

45
00:04:22,626 --> 00:04:25,949
[SPEAKER_12]: The chief of staff or someone else from the mayor's office?

46
00:04:26,946 --> 00:04:35,448
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't see the chief of staff or the mayor present, but Director Riggi is gonna go check in that office right now and see if they can pop over.

47
00:04:36,508 --> 00:04:36,848
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

48
00:04:37,969 --> 00:04:51,812
[SPEAKER_12]: I have one question that I was informed by another city department that they were told that they needed to stop their negotiations because of fear of

49
00:04:52,881 --> 00:05:06,670
[SPEAKER_12]: the outcome of the override so they didn't want to commit, I believe, to move forward with any issues with funding moving forward until they know what happens in November.

50
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,412
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm a little curious if that's the case.

51
00:05:10,873 --> 00:05:21,140
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe we should look at, I know there are some issues that we see that are on here now that I wouldn't object to because I know it's time sensitive.

52
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:25,243
[SPEAKER_12]: If it's something that's really needed, I think we should move forward.

53
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:40,154
[SPEAKER_12]: But if there are concerns with the override vote and funding moving forward, that they're holding off negotiations, then I think it's something we need to talk about, Council President.

54
00:05:40,614 --> 00:05:41,194
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you.

55
00:05:42,135 --> 00:05:43,316
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

56
00:05:43,496 --> 00:05:48,300
[SPEAKER_08]: Any other questions or comments by members of the Council before we move into the specific items?

57
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:56,188
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeing none, while we wait for Director Riggi to return, we'll start.

58
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:56,788
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll go in order.

59
00:05:56,849 --> 00:05:58,611
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll start with the water heater at the Brooks School.

60
00:05:58,631 --> 00:06:06,301
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll go to Assistant Superintendent Cushing, if you could give us a little information on the project and see if we have any questions from members of the council.

61
00:06:10,094 --> 00:06:14,097
[SPEAKER_09]: Good evening, thank you very much for having me here tonight on behalf of the Medford Public Schools.

62
00:06:15,158 --> 00:06:22,142
[SPEAKER_09]: Approximately last May, the original-to-the-building hot water heater at the Brooks Elementary School failed.

63
00:06:22,623 --> 00:06:26,726
[SPEAKER_09]: It is the last of that generation of schools to have its original hot water heater.

64
00:06:28,707 --> 00:06:37,590
[SPEAKER_09]: We are working with the Office of Sustainability on an overall HVAC program for the McGlynn and the Andrews schools.

65
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:41,612
[SPEAKER_09]: Those schools are at full replacement for their air conditioning systems.

66
00:06:42,132 --> 00:06:43,692
[SPEAKER_09]: It's another topic down the road.

67
00:06:45,808 --> 00:06:58,182
[SPEAKER_09]: We were able to loop in this project with the owners project manager and the designers who have worked at Medford High School previously the designers design the hot water heater for Medford High School.

68
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:04,168
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're able to loop this in as part of a high energy efficiency project, the school committee.

69
00:07:05,309 --> 00:07:16,376
[SPEAKER_09]: The school committee would like full electrification to get 100% away from fossil fuels in connection with the Medford stated goals for sustainability moving forward.

70
00:07:17,276 --> 00:07:23,140
[SPEAKER_09]: The costs of that were extraordinarily sobering and exorbitant.

71
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:29,484
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have gone with a condensing hot water heater that is 96% efficient.

72
00:07:31,645 --> 00:07:40,412
[SPEAKER_09]: and while still does use fossil fuels, given the costs, is the wise decision for Medford to move forward.

73
00:07:41,493 --> 00:07:50,780
[SPEAKER_09]: We've been working with both the Office of Sustainability, Director Riggi, on this project for the last six months or so to really move us forward.

74
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:54,783
[SPEAKER_09]: And by six months, that dates back to our work on the HVAC program.

75
00:07:54,943 --> 00:07:58,606
[SPEAKER_09]: And then once this failed, we moved this project into the mainline.

76
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:00,980
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

77
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,101
[SPEAKER_08]: Any questions for Superintendent Cushing?

78
00:08:09,743 --> 00:08:10,663
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeing none, I have one.

79
00:08:10,683 --> 00:08:12,984
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, Councilor Zara.

80
00:08:13,544 --> 00:08:17,326
[SPEAKER_10]: I am curious if you know how long these pieces of equipment last.

81
00:08:18,526 --> 00:08:24,508
[SPEAKER_09]: I will editorialize and say not as long as we would like, but the lifespan is seen as 10 to 15 years.

82
00:08:27,269 --> 00:08:27,569
[SPEAKER_08]: Got it.

83
00:08:27,769 --> 00:08:28,910
[SPEAKER_08]: I have two questions.

84
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:29,490
[SPEAKER_08]: One was,

85
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:34,811
[SPEAKER_08]: What did the, you know, we're looking at 267,000 here for this system.

86
00:08:35,391 --> 00:08:38,854
[SPEAKER_08]: What did the all electric system, what were the estimates coming in for that?

87
00:08:39,214 --> 00:08:56,488
[SPEAKER_09]: So I can't, our initial estimates for this system all in, we're in the neighborhood of $200,000 as of this past Friday, when we got the initial quotes and I received the quotes actually in hand today, we were anticipating $200,000 all in.

88
00:08:58,569 --> 00:09:02,371
[SPEAKER_09]: design, construction management, and purchase and installation of all equipment.

89
00:09:02,891 --> 00:09:07,674
[SPEAKER_09]: As you see before you today, that quote is with a 10% construction contingency.

90
00:09:08,934 --> 00:09:10,275
[SPEAKER_09]: It significantly exceeds $200,000.

91
00:09:10,335 --> 00:09:10,655
[SPEAKER_09]: The all electric

92
00:09:15,477 --> 00:09:16,898
[SPEAKER_09]: equipment was in the neighborhood of $349,000.

93
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:21,079
[SPEAKER_09]: That was before we went out to quote.

94
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:25,761
[SPEAKER_09]: Those were the estimates of JLL and B2Q.

95
00:09:26,221 --> 00:09:27,582
[SPEAKER_09]: It was $349,000.

96
00:09:27,702 --> 00:09:34,624
[SPEAKER_09]: I will say that that was far more than we were anticipating even for this system.

97
00:09:35,304 --> 00:09:36,505
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

98
00:09:36,945 --> 00:09:42,867
[SPEAKER_08]: And it sounds like we were able to make the initial water heaters last 20 years or so.

99
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:45,611
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is the last one to fail.

100
00:09:46,231 --> 00:09:54,035
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been new in this role for about the last 16, 18 months, so I don't have the timing on those others.

101
00:09:54,175 --> 00:10:06,821
[SPEAKER_09]: But from what I understand from Director McLaughlin is that they have all failed previously, and they were replaced with in-kind, high efficiency, but not 96% efficient.

102
00:10:07,021 --> 00:10:08,722
[SPEAKER_09]: But they've been replaced with in-kind.

103
00:10:10,723 --> 00:10:18,587
[SPEAKER_09]: gas-fired, as this will be gas-fired, but this being a condensing hot water heater, has significant efficiency savings.

104
00:10:19,788 --> 00:10:19,948
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

105
00:10:20,108 --> 00:10:28,612
[SPEAKER_09]: And this will be the way we move as the others, you know, now we're in this cycle of, you know, on the clock for all other building systems.

106
00:10:29,153 --> 00:10:29,353
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

107
00:10:29,993 --> 00:10:31,654
[SPEAKER_07]: Council Desiro.

108
00:10:31,694 --> 00:10:37,277
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a question generally for how we do these appropriations, is are we approving the

109
00:10:40,752 --> 00:10:46,513
[SPEAKER_10]: amount that they're authorized to offer, or is this the amount that it will cost?

110
00:10:46,593 --> 00:10:48,233
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, is this real numbers?

111
00:10:49,914 --> 00:10:51,594
[SPEAKER_10]: This may be different for each of these.

112
00:10:51,634 --> 00:10:54,634
[SPEAKER_08]: Before we go to bid, we have to authorize funding.

113
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:57,075
[SPEAKER_08]: So the authorization is based on the estimate.

114
00:10:57,295 --> 00:10:58,555
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is based on the estimate.

115
00:10:58,635 --> 00:11:00,655
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not like writing a check right now.

116
00:11:00,675 --> 00:11:03,016
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of this money may remain in the account.

117
00:11:03,956 --> 00:11:08,437
[SPEAKER_08]: I think if the bid comes in under the appropriated amount, then the balance reverts to the fund.

118
00:11:08,457 --> 00:11:09,777
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the most it could cost.

119
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,992
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, this is the, I mean, unless the bids come in higher.

120
00:11:13,252 --> 00:11:13,432
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

121
00:11:13,753 --> 00:11:19,838
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is what I think the best estimate for authorization and then the bidding process will determine the final cost.

122
00:11:19,878 --> 00:11:20,518
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that correct?

123
00:11:20,758 --> 00:11:20,938
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

124
00:11:21,359 --> 00:11:25,122
[SPEAKER_09]: And this follows under Chapter 25A.

125
00:11:26,283 --> 00:11:29,305
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is considered an efficiency upgrade.

126
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:37,472
[SPEAKER_09]: So as long as we don't exceed $300,000, there's some flexibility with bids, but we have requested

127
00:11:38,552 --> 00:11:47,734
[SPEAKER_09]: of JLL and B2Q to examine a third option, if possible.

128
00:11:47,814 --> 00:11:55,595
[SPEAKER_09]: We have received two quotes thus far, which under Chapter 25A, they fall under the $300,000.

129
00:11:56,235 --> 00:12:02,097
[SPEAKER_09]: But we have requested a third quote because the costs are sobering.

130
00:12:04,297 --> 00:12:04,497
[SPEAKER_09]: Got it.

131
00:12:06,488 --> 00:12:16,998
[SPEAKER_09]: It also requires, this project also requires a significant amount of electrical upgrades to the building to be able to make this new piece of equipment function.

132
00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:23,505
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's also one of the hidden costs as opposed to just swapping with an in-kind

133
00:12:24,768 --> 00:12:33,054
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, hot water heater, which could be an easy swap, but does nothing to move Medford towards its climate goals.

134
00:12:33,935 --> 00:12:36,257
[SPEAKER_09]: Or does, I shouldn't, does very little.

135
00:12:37,117 --> 00:12:37,658
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Zara.

136
00:12:38,558 --> 00:12:40,780
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, I'm sorry about all these questions.

137
00:12:41,461 --> 00:12:51,048
[SPEAKER_10]: Does this imply further issues like this because all the elementary schools were built at the same time and everything would presumably be failing at the same time?

138
00:12:52,929 --> 00:12:53,289
[SPEAKER_09]: I think, um,

139
00:12:54,926 --> 00:12:59,471
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, buildings are approaching 25 years old.

140
00:13:00,592 --> 00:13:05,537
[SPEAKER_09]: Director Riggi can probably speak far better than this than I can as a primarily academic leader.

141
00:13:06,838 --> 00:13:11,703
[SPEAKER_09]: But learning fast on the job, that's about half life for buildings.

142
00:13:12,264 --> 00:13:16,628
[SPEAKER_09]: And while we like to think of these as still quote unquote the new schools,

143
00:13:17,809 --> 00:13:43,335
[SPEAKER_09]: The reality is that they are approaching midlife and building systems are not an infinite thing, similar to our homes, but they are systems that will need replacement, updating, and continual upkeep and maintenance is a critical aspect to all of these systems, as well as proper training and all those types of things.

144
00:13:45,489 --> 00:13:51,951
[SPEAKER_09]: So the answer is building systems have a lifespan and we're halfway through that.

145
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:56,553
[SPEAKER_09]: We're beyond the lifespan and halfway through the lifespan of these buildings.

146
00:13:57,573 --> 00:14:06,636
[SPEAKER_08]: From what Mr. Cushing said, the hot water heaters and all the other new buildings that early 2000s buildings have already been replaced.

147
00:14:08,137 --> 00:14:12,278
[SPEAKER_08]: But the HVAC systems and Mr. Director, if you want to come up and say anything about the

148
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:13,652
[SPEAKER_08]: general condition.

149
00:14:13,692 --> 00:14:18,073
[SPEAKER_08]: I know we've talked a lot about the middle schools, HVAC being a significant investment that's needed.

150
00:14:18,433 --> 00:14:37,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Part of my new role, which was granted by the school committee when they finalized the vote two weeks ago, I think, is I will be looking at all building systems in all school buildings and working with school staff to develop a plan for maintenance and also

151
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:42,461
[SPEAKER_02]: get a schedule of replacements that we may need in the city.

152
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:53,171
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're not surprised by large amounts, so we can start planning properly for when we think systems will go, and it will be much easier to budget that way.

153
00:14:54,152 --> 00:14:54,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Zara.

154
00:14:55,733 --> 00:15:04,141
[SPEAKER_10]: My main concern in asking that was about the upgrades to the electrical systems and sort of more broad-based issues that might start coming up, and if there

155
00:15:04,537 --> 00:15:16,840
[SPEAKER_10]: probably this is already something that's on your radar if that's something that you've been talking about just prior to piece by piece these things start to fail and then we have to go back and look at.

156
00:15:17,656 --> 00:15:19,197
[SPEAKER_10]: electrical system updates?

157
00:15:19,538 --> 00:15:25,741
[SPEAKER_02]: As you look at the new equipment and the more efficient it becomes, the more power it's going to require.

158
00:15:26,542 --> 00:15:34,287
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully we won't run into these problems, but we may run into the problems and we'll have to address them as part of the project.

159
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:38,389
[SPEAKER_02]: But then the school is at a benefit because they have better electrical service.

160
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:45,614
[SPEAKER_10]: If I may, I'm glad to hear that there's sort of a comprehensive plan in place that you're

161
00:15:46,061 --> 00:15:47,502
[SPEAKER_10]: looking at and thinking about these systems.

162
00:15:47,522 --> 00:15:48,863
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's encouraging.

163
00:15:49,043 --> 00:15:49,624
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you.

164
00:15:51,985 --> 00:15:52,766
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

165
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:54,447
[SPEAKER_08]: Any further questions on this item?

166
00:15:54,467 --> 00:15:56,048
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll go to Vice President Collins.

167
00:15:58,590 --> 00:15:59,791
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you to President Barras.

168
00:15:59,811 --> 00:16:04,294
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much for being with us today to give us some context on this item.

169
00:16:06,356 --> 00:16:14,222
[SPEAKER_05]: As has been discussed, it's always sobering to hear of having to potentially put on the table a little bit more than we initially thought would have to be budgeted.

170
00:16:15,342 --> 00:16:25,768
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, unfortunately, we're in a fiscal environment where that is happening across the board because the cost of all sorts of infrastructural tools, materials and services are more expensive than they've been.

171
00:16:26,388 --> 00:16:29,629
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, when these estimates were made several years in the past due to inflation and other factors.

172
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:37,453
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that this is one of those scenarios where, you know, it never feels great to have to spend more than we had initially forecast.

173
00:16:38,214 --> 00:16:42,436
[SPEAKER_05]: But this is still a non-negotiable and I think it is well worth

174
00:16:43,317 --> 00:16:52,506
[SPEAKER_05]: spending a little bit more to make sure that what we are investing in is more resilient for the future when we know these systems will, you know, have to be maintained, have to be upgraded.

175
00:16:53,226 --> 00:17:00,393
[SPEAKER_05]: And if we're going to be putting money on the table at all, I'd rather it be getting us closer to our climate goals and be a part of a new, more resilient system for our schools.

176
00:17:01,494 --> 00:17:02,735
[SPEAKER_05]: You already covered the questions that I had.

177
00:17:02,775 --> 00:17:03,396
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much.

178
00:17:04,016 --> 00:17:05,858
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would be happy to motion to approve this.

179
00:17:09,309 --> 00:17:09,709
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

180
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:15,534
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we'll see where we are at the end of the presentations and hopefully we can refer items out to the regular meeting.

181
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:20,458
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeing no further questions, Mr. Superintendent, thank you for answering them.

182
00:17:20,478 --> 00:17:21,539
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll move to the next item.

183
00:17:21,899 --> 00:17:22,219
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

184
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,922
[SPEAKER_08]: Next item is roadway patching in the amount of $112,728.

185
00:17:24,962 --> 00:17:26,303
[SPEAKER_08]: And that I believe is our city engineer.

186
00:17:35,947 --> 00:17:36,207
[SPEAKER_13]: Hello.

187
00:17:36,307 --> 00:17:36,687
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

188
00:17:37,348 --> 00:17:38,669
[SPEAKER_13]: My name is Owen Wartella.

189
00:17:38,709 --> 00:17:39,489
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm the city engineer.

190
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:44,772
[SPEAKER_13]: We're requesting $112,738 for some roadway patching that came in over our estimate when we went out to bid.

191
00:17:53,069 --> 00:18:03,374
[SPEAKER_13]: basically the cost of asphalt has gone up close to $10 per square yard over what we had estimated, and our estimates were from earlier this spring and early summer.

192
00:18:04,695 --> 00:18:18,482
[SPEAKER_13]: We'd like to do all the roads, and if the only other option would be to re-bid, we wouldn't get the roadways done this year, it'd be in the spring, so we're trying to move this forward before it gets a little too cold.

193
00:18:20,993 --> 00:18:22,895
[SPEAKER_08]: Any questions for City Engineer?

194
00:18:25,338 --> 00:18:25,938
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Kelly?

195
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,604
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, do you have any more specifics about like which which roadways are going to be worked on?

196
00:18:31,624 --> 00:18:31,904
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure.

197
00:18:32,265 --> 00:18:32,965
[SPEAKER_13]: We are

198
00:18:34,918 --> 00:18:40,002
[SPEAKER_13]: Planning to do two types of restaurant, we're taking two approaches here.

199
00:18:40,623 --> 00:18:51,311
[SPEAKER_13]: One is going to be the other half of what national grid started, there's four roads Wicker have Bradbury have Columbia road and picture of that we're going to pay the other half of the street.

200
00:18:52,054 --> 00:18:53,575
[SPEAKER_13]: that they had already started this year.

201
00:18:53,775 --> 00:19:12,650
[SPEAKER_13]: And then the other approach that we're gonna do is we're doing arterial roadways, large roadways, and we're designating 800 square yards for each of those roadways, and that's gonna be Main Street, Salem Street, Boston Ave, and Freedom Way.

202
00:19:14,878 --> 00:19:15,919
[SPEAKER_06]: Am I allowed to cheer?

203
00:19:16,119 --> 00:19:18,800
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that allowed?

204
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,001
[SPEAKER_13]: We're trying to get it done.

205
00:19:21,301 --> 00:19:22,582
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be miraculous.

206
00:19:22,622 --> 00:19:22,822
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

207
00:19:23,542 --> 00:19:23,842
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

208
00:19:24,923 --> 00:19:27,204
[SPEAKER_08]: Any other questions on the roadway patching?

209
00:19:30,045 --> 00:19:31,606
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeing none, I have one.

210
00:19:32,206 --> 00:19:38,229
[SPEAKER_08]: When we say that the square yard cost went up $10 a square yard, what is that from and what is that to?

211
00:19:39,376 --> 00:19:54,822
[SPEAKER_13]: From 30 are the our earlier estimates this year when we were putting bids out and getting them back The contractors were averaging around $35 a square yard now The lowest bid was 45 a square yard.

212
00:19:55,362 --> 00:20:04,326
[SPEAKER_08]: All right Do you have any understanding as to why that's happening or I think asphalt is expensive I

213
00:20:08,877 --> 00:20:10,518
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, no, no, no, no.

214
00:20:10,618 --> 00:20:11,038
[SPEAKER_13]: I hear you.

215
00:20:11,238 --> 00:20:17,941
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, it could be a whole like social economic, you know, wormhole that we go down, but I, you know, I, it, the cost has gone up.

216
00:20:18,601 --> 00:20:18,821
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

217
00:20:18,841 --> 00:20:22,843
[SPEAKER_08]: I just didn't know if there was any specific supply chain stuff that you might know about that we might not know about.

218
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:29,125
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, but I will just note that, uh, 10, you know, the percentage change there is huge.

219
00:20:29,185 --> 00:20:30,246
[SPEAKER_08]: It's almost 25% higher than we thought.

220
00:20:30,326 --> 00:20:31,946
[SPEAKER_08]: And 25 is a lot more than 2.5.

221
00:20:41,926 --> 00:20:45,307
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, any other questions regarding roadway patching?

222
00:20:47,027 --> 00:20:49,528
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeing none, I will go to the next item.

223
00:20:49,588 --> 00:20:52,949
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Randazzo, replacement of light poles in the city parking lots in the amount of $105,000.

224
00:20:52,989 --> 00:20:55,029
[SPEAKER_08]: What do we got, Steve?

225
00:20:55,209 --> 00:20:56,249
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening, council.

226
00:20:56,669 --> 00:21:01,991
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for your service to the city and thank you for your time hearing me on this issue.

227
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:23,642
[SPEAKER_11]: It was brought to my attention that we have a substantial amount of deterioration on streetlight poles that are all along Clippership and in the City Hall parking lot and along behind the square in the parking lot there as well, where we had a pole come down on its own.

228
00:21:24,362 --> 00:21:31,626
[SPEAKER_11]: And once I was aware of the severity through

229
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:40,393
[SPEAKER_11]: Todd was working on one of his own projects and was able to get some photos, which we have attached.

230
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:45,275
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's something that I think should be addressed sooner than later.

231
00:21:46,576 --> 00:21:51,158
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not like we can remove the ones that are in worse shape than others.

232
00:21:51,278 --> 00:21:54,639
[SPEAKER_11]: It's really hard to tell underlying issues.

233
00:21:54,699 --> 00:21:55,540
[SPEAKER_11]: You can't really tell.

234
00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:00,161
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's the best thing to do is to do them all at once.

235
00:22:00,221 --> 00:22:04,443
[SPEAKER_11]: They were all installed at the same time, and it was roughly 40 years ago.

236
00:22:05,003 --> 00:22:13,366
[SPEAKER_11]: So they've pretty much exceeded their shelf life, and I just want to make sure that we don't have another issue and provide public safety.

237
00:22:14,506 --> 00:22:14,806
[SPEAKER_08]: Got it.

238
00:22:15,566 --> 00:22:15,967
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

239
00:22:15,987 --> 00:22:17,067
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll go to Councilor Leming.

240
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:18,930
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

241
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:21,652
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I see these photos and they look horrifying.

242
00:22:22,852 --> 00:22:25,473
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you for putting in this request.

243
00:22:25,513 --> 00:22:36,659
[SPEAKER_03]: Just only question, you said that these are 40 years old, are the new telephone poles that you plan to install, what is the expected shelf life for those?

244
00:22:37,339 --> 00:22:40,801
[SPEAKER_11]: That I wouldn't be able to give you an answer on that.

245
00:22:41,082 --> 00:22:46,445
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it all determined on the weather factors and the elements involved.

246
00:22:47,486 --> 00:22:52,009
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think you'll get a basis of a shelf life on a warranty purpose.

247
00:22:52,729 --> 00:22:57,192
[SPEAKER_11]: But other than that, I wouldn't be able to give you an honest answer at this time.

248
00:22:58,293 --> 00:22:58,633
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

249
00:23:00,675 --> 00:23:02,256
[SPEAKER_08]: Any other questions for Mr. Rendazzo?

250
00:23:02,296 --> 00:23:04,077
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll go to Councilor Scarpelli.

251
00:23:04,901 --> 00:23:05,982
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, thank you, Mr President.

252
00:23:06,662 --> 00:23:07,662
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, Mr Randazzo again.

253
00:23:07,702 --> 00:23:08,903
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for everything you do.

254
00:23:09,023 --> 00:23:17,126
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that, uh, you are your, um, history and saving money for our community is second to none.

255
00:23:17,206 --> 00:23:19,707
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that everyone should realize that.

256
00:23:20,467 --> 00:23:34,073
[SPEAKER_12]: But my question is, along with this, I've I've gotten many phone calls from the business district, and I know what some of the changes in parking in Medford Square that the discussion has been that there's going to be

257
00:23:34,673 --> 00:23:48,045
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, the parking for the business community, um, on, um, on Salem Street next to that parking lot next to the I believe it's a national grid building their substation building.

258
00:23:48,966 --> 00:23:53,911
[SPEAKER_12]: One of the concerns that the businesses has that there is no lighting in that lot.

259
00:23:54,011 --> 00:23:55,873
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that been discussed by any chance?

260
00:23:56,753 --> 00:23:58,355
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, we are office.

261
00:23:59,987 --> 00:24:03,748
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor, we did install lighting a few years back.

262
00:24:04,548 --> 00:24:16,852
[SPEAKER_11]: They are floodlights, and we've also had to angle them because of the residents on the other side of the parking lot were complaining about the light intruding upon their privacy.

263
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:19,113
[SPEAKER_11]: So we had to angle them down.

264
00:24:20,473 --> 00:24:29,016
[SPEAKER_11]: When you angle them down, you're taking away the distance of the light, decreasing the effectiveness of the light itself.

265
00:24:30,407 --> 00:24:34,472
[SPEAKER_11]: But other than that, there has been no talk of adding any additional lighting.

266
00:24:35,413 --> 00:24:35,513
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

267
00:24:35,573 --> 00:24:35,953
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

268
00:24:36,053 --> 00:24:36,414
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

269
00:24:40,619 --> 00:24:40,979
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

270
00:24:42,701 --> 00:24:48,487
[SPEAKER_08]: I had one question just when the poll came down, what was the, did it hit anything?

271
00:24:48,688 --> 00:24:49,669
[SPEAKER_08]: What was the impact of it?

272
00:24:51,018 --> 00:24:52,239
[SPEAKER_11]: It did not hit anything.

273
00:24:52,259 --> 00:24:54,581
[SPEAKER_11]: I was out on medical leave when this happened.

274
00:24:54,861 --> 00:25:00,244
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't realize it came down on its own until roughly about a month ago.

275
00:25:01,045 --> 00:25:04,987
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's when I took action with this process.

276
00:25:05,807 --> 00:25:12,071
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought it was knocked down and there was gonna be an accident report to claim funding like typically would happen.

277
00:25:12,512 --> 00:25:14,553
[SPEAKER_11]: But unfortunately it came down on its own.

278
00:25:15,162 --> 00:25:18,864
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, and was it on a sidewalk, parking lot, roadway?

279
00:25:18,924 --> 00:25:22,646
[SPEAKER_11]: It landed in the parking lot over behind where the old CVS was.

280
00:25:23,106 --> 00:25:24,187
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, all right.

281
00:25:25,507 --> 00:25:28,529
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know you weren't around, did it happen late at night or?

282
00:25:28,549 --> 00:25:29,809
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't recall.

283
00:25:29,829 --> 00:25:30,970
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't know, yeah, it's okay.

284
00:25:31,951 --> 00:25:38,614
[SPEAKER_08]: Just obviously wanna not have light poles falling on cars or people or anything else, so.

285
00:25:39,133 --> 00:25:47,536
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a very similar situation to what happened on Freedom Way, going to the schools, all the lighting that had the same type of deterioration.

286
00:25:48,076 --> 00:25:57,440
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's not like we could just take down the ones that are worse than others, because then you increase the risk of now it's dark and there's a public safety issue.

287
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:00,181
[SPEAKER_11]: You can't really juggle the two.

288
00:26:00,541 --> 00:26:03,162
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think it's prudent to do all of them at once.

289
00:26:03,782 --> 00:26:03,982
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

290
00:26:04,743 --> 00:26:05,023
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

291
00:26:06,556 --> 00:26:12,706
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeing no further questions, we'll move to our next item, which is the elevator repair unforeseen costs.

292
00:26:12,726 --> 00:26:13,848
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll go to Director Riggi.

293
00:26:17,924 --> 00:26:18,504
[SPEAKER_02]: I thank you.

294
00:26:19,324 --> 00:26:24,606
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, thank you for your patience while the elevator has been down a little longer than we expected.

295
00:26:25,266 --> 00:26:37,509
[SPEAKER_02]: Part of that is that we found that we had to upgrade a lot of the electrical systems for the elevator in the elevator machine room, and we had to upgrade our fire alarm system here in City Hall.

296
00:26:38,389 --> 00:26:45,011
[SPEAKER_02]: So now, if there is a smoke detector that's tripped for the elevator, the elevator will actually stop.

297
00:26:45,891 --> 00:26:48,591
[SPEAKER_02]: and signal the fire department so they can come here.

298
00:26:48,852 --> 00:26:52,892
[SPEAKER_02]: So that were the unforeseen costs.

299
00:26:52,952 --> 00:26:58,133
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't realize that the code changed that drastically until we started getting into the project.

300
00:26:59,613 --> 00:26:59,913
[SPEAKER_08]: Got it.

301
00:27:00,874 --> 00:27:02,374
[SPEAKER_08]: Any questions from members of the council?

302
00:27:04,714 --> 00:27:06,014
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. President, if I can.

303
00:27:06,034 --> 00:27:07,075
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Scarpelli.

304
00:27:07,095 --> 00:27:11,235
[SPEAKER_12]: A question on that topic.

305
00:27:12,776 --> 00:27:15,056
[SPEAKER_12]: Is the elevator still currently out?

306
00:27:16,581 --> 00:27:25,505
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we're hoping tomorrow the elevator company and the fire alarm company are here ensuring that their programming work together.

307
00:27:25,766 --> 00:27:31,208
[SPEAKER_02]: And if that happens, then we will contact the state to have it inspected and we can get it back up and running.

308
00:27:31,668 --> 00:27:34,770
[SPEAKER_02]: So if that all works, hopefully we can get it back up and running next week.

309
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:51,984
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, I bring this up because last night we had a very important meeting and I think everybody unanimously decided that having a community meeting with our senior citizens that we're having some confusion on what the debt exclusion and the override questions were.

310
00:27:52,585 --> 00:27:54,566
[SPEAKER_12]: And I get had a few phone calls today.

311
00:27:55,567 --> 00:28:10,019
[SPEAKER_12]: uh from uh representing people that are representing that uh our senior citizens and they were very concerned that uh will the elevators be functioning on october 15th and if not i think we need to

312
00:28:10,659 --> 00:28:19,063
[SPEAKER_12]: seriously consider moving that committee to the whole meeting to a location where senior citizens can attend that meeting.

313
00:28:19,163 --> 00:28:23,324
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it defeats the purpose of what we agreed on yesterday.

314
00:28:23,865 --> 00:28:26,606
[SPEAKER_12]: If we have people that can't climb stairs.

315
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:29,767
[SPEAKER_12]: Is the 15th something that can work?

316
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:41,763
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I will tomorrow and if I can also authorize overtime to have the elevator inspector come out during overtime.

317
00:28:42,223 --> 00:28:43,805
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be that'd be great.

318
00:28:43,825 --> 00:28:45,507
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can, I can use that.

319
00:28:45,828 --> 00:28:51,695
[SPEAKER_02]: I will report back once I find out tomorrow, if everything went well, the timeline.

320
00:28:54,244 --> 00:28:55,025
[SPEAKER_08]: Great, thank you.

321
00:28:56,726 --> 00:28:59,948
[SPEAKER_08]: Any other questions for Director Riggi on the elevator?

322
00:29:00,409 --> 00:29:11,157
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. President, if we can, if we just have the clerk, if we can, as soon as Mr. Riggi gets us an update, if we can update the council with that, that'd be greatly appreciated.

323
00:29:11,197 --> 00:29:11,518
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

324
00:29:12,518 --> 00:29:15,200
[SPEAKER_08]: When you have some info, if you could send us an email, we'll get it out.

325
00:29:15,541 --> 00:29:16,401
[SPEAKER_08]: Great, thank you.

326
00:29:18,483 --> 00:29:22,907
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, next item we have is the,

327
00:29:24,537 --> 00:29:26,439
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, I lost my screen here.

328
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:27,721
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it Brooks Estate?

329
00:29:28,582 --> 00:29:29,623
[SPEAKER_08]: Brooks Estate, great.

330
00:29:29,903 --> 00:29:31,185
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm familiar with this project.

331
00:29:31,225 --> 00:29:35,970
[SPEAKER_08]: We do have our Brooks Estate president, Carly Nessen here.

332
00:29:36,891 --> 00:29:37,652
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome, Carly.

333
00:29:37,752 --> 00:29:42,918
[SPEAKER_08]: I can go quickly through just to say that this is a request for $55,000.

334
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:47,722
[SPEAKER_08]: for repairs at the Brooks Estate.

335
00:29:48,483 --> 00:30:06,278
[SPEAKER_08]: The breakdown of that, I'm sure Carly can go into more details, but there are some roof repairs and snow repairs and insulation and radiator work that need to happen as well as drywall repairs, walls and ceilings in the caretaker spaces and floors

336
00:30:07,136 --> 00:30:12,499
[SPEAKER_08]: in the caretaker spaces as well as some pest control in the attic.

337
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:26,205
[SPEAKER_08]: And that is important because we are seeking new caretakers at the estate to oversee and watch and keep safe the city property that is the Brooks Estate and the Shepherd Brooks Manor.

338
00:30:26,326 --> 00:30:32,449
[SPEAKER_08]: So with that, I will go to Carly Nessen, president of the Medford Brooks Estate Land Trust.

339
00:30:33,589 --> 00:30:35,030
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much and thanks for

340
00:30:37,034 --> 00:30:55,073
[SPEAKER_06]: hearing this I mean it's it would be a great deal to us to shore up the manor before winter hits especially that's kind of precipitating the timing of this as well not only the new caretaker search that we are currently undergoing and getting the space refreshed for them but of course the winterization piece

341
00:30:55,873 --> 00:31:01,516
[SPEAKER_06]: of making sure that our roof is not leaking and that we don't have a larger bill next year for roof repairs.

342
00:31:01,636 --> 00:31:11,882
[SPEAKER_06]: So part of the funding we're asking for is all about the roof repair and making sure we have some insulation and a tighter envelope for us this winter.

343
00:31:12,422 --> 00:31:17,805
[SPEAKER_06]: And then of course, just that refresh with the painting and the plastering as president council bears mentioned.

344
00:31:17,825 --> 00:31:21,827
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

345
00:31:21,947 --> 00:31:24,709
[SPEAKER_08]: Any questions for President Nesson?

346
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:29,520
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Scarpelli, I see a hand raised.

347
00:31:32,401 --> 00:31:35,322
[SPEAKER_12]: Forgive me, that's a late hand Council President.

348
00:31:36,402 --> 00:31:38,183
[SPEAKER_08]: Got it, I'll go to Councilor Leming.

349
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:53,529
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, I'd just like to know, could this funding have come from the CPA and are there other Brooks Estate projects at the moment with active CPA funding?

350
00:31:55,841 --> 00:31:57,723
[SPEAKER_08]: I will go to Carly on active projects.

351
00:31:57,763 --> 00:32:00,005
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I'll have to unmute you.

352
00:32:00,966 --> 00:32:05,509
[SPEAKER_08]: This is preventative maintenance, so it doesn't fall under CPA.

353
00:32:09,953 --> 00:32:11,594
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't have any active CPA projects.

354
00:32:11,614 --> 00:32:15,137
[SPEAKER_06]: We just finished up the Grove Wall, Grove Street Wall, and that was the most recent.

355
00:32:15,217 --> 00:32:22,123
[SPEAKER_06]: This falls out of cycle with that because of its timeliness with winter is probably the answer of why it's not covered by CPA.

356
00:32:23,649 --> 00:32:25,491
[SPEAKER_03]: Got it, so this is an historic preservation.

357
00:32:25,771 --> 00:32:27,532
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that clarified my question.

358
00:32:27,912 --> 00:32:28,093
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

359
00:32:28,133 --> 00:32:29,354
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, correct.

360
00:32:29,714 --> 00:32:31,695
[SPEAKER_08]: Maintenance and emergency repairs.

361
00:32:32,576 --> 00:32:32,856
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

362
00:32:35,619 --> 00:32:41,263
[SPEAKER_08]: Great, any other questions regarding the Brooks Estate item, the repairs at the Brooks Estate?

363
00:32:45,006 --> 00:32:51,491
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeing none, we do have the Chief of Staff, who is, I'm sure, working diligently on another thing right now, and if you need a minute,

364
00:32:52,790 --> 00:33:05,202
[SPEAKER_08]: I can give you a minute, but Councilor Scarpelli did have a question, I think, potentially related to the fire item that came off the agenda.

365
00:33:08,665 --> 00:33:10,627
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Scarpelli, if you wanna restate the question.

366
00:33:10,647 --> 00:33:12,910
[SPEAKER_12]: No, thank you, Council President.

367
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:15,432
[SPEAKER_12]: No, it's not the fire.

368
00:33:17,287 --> 00:33:33,319
[SPEAKER_12]: I was, uh, was talking to someone from the negotiating team from our method police department and they were told during negotiations, I believe that negotiations will be delayed, um, for the fact that the override, um, might be in question.

369
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:41,966
[SPEAKER_12]: So because of that fact that we need to, um, hold off until we get more understanding or, or see what the vote would be.

370
00:33:42,626 --> 00:33:43,307
[SPEAKER_12]: And, um,

371
00:33:45,157 --> 00:33:48,299
[SPEAKER_12]: in November to move forward with their negotiations.

372
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:58,706
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, the second part of that question is that if that is an issue, um, I'm under the impression that, uh, there's a negotiating line item.

373
00:33:59,407 --> 00:34:02,689
[SPEAKER_12]: And if if that's not the case, could you educate me?

374
00:34:03,149 --> 00:34:06,151
[SPEAKER_12]: And if there is a case that that it is, um,

375
00:34:07,452 --> 00:34:28,295
[SPEAKER_12]: if you can let us know what we are with that as well because in my in my capacity when there's negotiations there's understanding that most municipalities have a negotiated line item that has funding already set aside and if we're holding that out

376
00:34:28,935 --> 00:34:35,241
[SPEAKER_12]: because of fear that the override will not move forward and needing that funding.

377
00:34:35,801 --> 00:34:52,756
[SPEAKER_12]: It could be construed of maybe as a fair tactic if the administration is moving in a for yes vote or it then leaves me a little befuddled if we don't have a line item when we negotiate with our union members.

378
00:34:52,796 --> 00:34:53,557
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you.

379
00:34:57,554 --> 00:34:57,654
[SPEAKER_08]: you.

380
00:34:57,674 --> 00:34:58,355
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

381
00:34:58,375 --> 00:34:58,615
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

382
00:34:58,635 --> 00:35:00,516
[SPEAKER_08]: Chief Stephanie's area.

383
00:35:00,576 --> 00:35:05,500
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, President Bears through you to Councilor Scarapelli and frankly to the entire council.

384
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,462
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know what?

385
00:35:08,402 --> 00:35:15,808
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't I don't entirely follow the nexus, and I don't believe this is a matter on the agenda, but I will answer the question of the council would like me to answer the question.

386
00:35:16,308 --> 00:35:16,949
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no answer.

387
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:17,849
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no issue with that.

388
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:30,427
[SPEAKER_01]: police department negotiations being delayed relative to the override has any merit.

389
00:35:32,149 --> 00:35:33,830
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know where that's coming from.

390
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:35,072
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't believe that's a fact.

391
00:35:36,613 --> 00:35:39,757
[SPEAKER_01]: I certainly can ask questions, but I have no information on that.

392
00:35:39,917 --> 00:35:43,501
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't believe that there is any basis or truth to that statement.

393
00:35:44,102 --> 00:35:44,803
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, thank you.

394
00:35:45,323 --> 00:35:46,024
[SPEAKER_01]: Misunderstanding.

395
00:35:47,219 --> 00:35:53,345
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, just with that, though, I just, I think it is a direct correlation of what we're asking for.

396
00:35:53,365 --> 00:35:53,866
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that.

397
00:35:54,747 --> 00:36:03,295
[SPEAKER_12]: If that is, and we do find that until until we get to our next regular meeting, where we will vote on these, these initiatives, I think that.

398
00:36:04,369 --> 00:36:15,552
[SPEAKER_12]: the understanding that if we're looking at, and this is the case, if you do find research and they do come back and says, no, we did mention that.

399
00:36:15,612 --> 00:36:20,034
[SPEAKER_12]: And if that's the case, then it's relevant for tonight's meeting.

400
00:36:21,094 --> 00:36:30,637
[SPEAKER_12]: And the fact that if we do have questions about our financial question marks after the override and where,

401
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:58,055
[SPEAKER_12]: we're talking we're we're discussing this with a negotiating team then i think that everything has to be on the table when the mayor presents any sort of funding for anything right now um like i said there are things that are presented today that when it comes to a vote i i don't think i can hesitate because i think it's needed but there are some other things that we can look at and say hey i would like i would motion to sever and then look at the different options because of

402
00:36:58,955 --> 00:37:17,408
[SPEAKER_12]: uh the need of funding if that's the case moving forward so i think there's a direct correlation of what i was told and what is on the agenda tonight so thank you mr president and thank you chief of staff nazarian thank you and thank you for being here councillor lemming um

403
00:37:18,732 --> 00:37:21,233
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I didn't entirely follow that.

404
00:37:21,633 --> 00:37:25,155
[SPEAKER_03]: I would motion to approve and send this to regular meeting.

405
00:37:25,775 --> 00:37:30,857
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion of council, I'm going to refer the paper with the items to the regular meeting, seconded by Councilor Tseng.

406
00:37:30,998 --> 00:37:31,898
[SPEAKER_08]: Any further discussion?

407
00:37:34,979 --> 00:37:37,440
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a raised hand for participation.

408
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:39,541
[SPEAKER_08]: Give me one second here.

409
00:37:39,601 --> 00:37:43,023
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll go to Gaston Fiore.

410
00:37:43,043 --> 00:37:47,265
[SPEAKER_08]: Or Councilor Scarpelli, is that, do you want to go?

411
00:37:47,952 --> 00:38:10,541
[SPEAKER_12]: yeah i apologize i just want to make sure if it's if i'm confusing councillor uh lemming i can clarify if he wants um the confusion is if there is an issue that's dealing with our city financial concerns and and one group or one situation is being um frozen for uh the the fear of

412
00:38:11,852 --> 00:38:24,934
[SPEAKER_12]: lack of funding later on in November, then this would be a concern moving any money doctor to the next level, considering if there is

413
00:38:25,962 --> 00:38:34,364
[SPEAKER_12]: some fear and I appreciate the chief of staff looking into it and hoping it's just a rumor, but I got it from a credible source.

414
00:38:34,404 --> 00:38:38,825
[SPEAKER_12]: That's actually part of the negotiating team that said that that did happen.

415
00:38:38,885 --> 00:38:43,746
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'd like to see maybe, maybe there's some misunderstanding there and get some corrections.

416
00:38:43,806 --> 00:38:48,387
[SPEAKER_12]: But if you're confused with that, I can clear it up if you have any questions for me.

417
00:38:48,407 --> 00:38:52,288
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll go to vice president Collins.

418
00:38:54,687 --> 00:38:55,588
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, President Bears.

419
00:38:55,988 --> 00:38:57,230
[SPEAKER_05]: Appreciate this discussion.

420
00:38:59,032 --> 00:39:05,559
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate this discussion also being put in the context of the other budgeting tools that the Council goes through throughout the year.

421
00:39:06,965 --> 00:39:21,412
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems to me that the questions of negotiations are ones that the administration forecasts and creates its container for during the annual budgeting process, which we of course went through this past June and will again for FY26 starting next year.

422
00:39:21,912 --> 00:39:29,416
[SPEAKER_05]: And I also just want to remind the Council that the appropriations before us are from the capital, the capital stabilization fund.

423
00:39:30,356 --> 00:39:34,678
[SPEAKER_05]: So the money requests, the appropriation requests that are before us are

424
00:39:35,416 --> 00:39:38,337
[SPEAKER_05]: limited to appropriation for capital spending purposes.

425
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:42,258
[SPEAKER_05]: And they are very limited in that way.

426
00:39:42,298 --> 00:39:45,979
[SPEAKER_05]: These are not dollars that could be used for any purpose at all in the city.

427
00:39:45,999 --> 00:39:48,220
[SPEAKER_05]: They are limited to capital expenditures.

428
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:55,222
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is why we are considering infrastructural and maintenance projects before us this evening.

429
00:39:55,922 --> 00:39:56,222
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

430
00:39:57,523 --> 00:39:58,583
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. President, if I can.

431
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:00,562
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Scarpelli.

432
00:40:01,303 --> 00:40:11,377
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I understand that we have, we have, we, we can, we can respect, excuse me, we can, we can agree to disagree.

433
00:40:11,477 --> 00:40:15,102
[SPEAKER_12]: But again, I think it's important that, um,

434
00:40:15,843 --> 00:40:26,446
[SPEAKER_12]: if it does come to a climate when we need to petition to move funding around from different accounts, there are mechanisms that we could do that depending on what accounts.

435
00:40:26,486 --> 00:40:33,208
[SPEAKER_12]: So I would say everything would be open until we understand the true financial picture on November 5th.

436
00:40:33,308 --> 00:40:34,529
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you, Mr. President.

437
00:40:37,610 --> 00:40:38,010
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

438
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:39,290
[SPEAKER_08]: Go to public participation.

439
00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:40,631
[SPEAKER_08]: Gaston Fiore.

440
00:40:41,351 --> 00:40:43,331
[SPEAKER_08]: I will ask you to unmute and you'll have three minutes.

441
00:40:43,411 --> 00:40:45,052
[SPEAKER_08]: Name and address for the record, please.

442
00:40:47,486 --> 00:40:49,489
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much Mr. President.

443
00:40:49,589 --> 00:40:58,644
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just like to clarify something related to the comment that was made that stated that 25% is a lot more than 2.5%.

444
00:41:01,610 --> 00:41:12,496
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would just would like to point out one myth that has been going around, and that is that Proposition 2.5 implies that cities cannot increase revenue fast enough to account for inflation.

445
00:41:12,996 --> 00:41:13,656
[SPEAKER_00]: That is false.

446
00:41:14,237 --> 00:41:19,219
[SPEAKER_00]: Proposition 2.5 excludes four cases from the limitation on tax levy increases.

447
00:41:19,899 --> 00:41:21,220
[SPEAKER_00]: One such case is new growth.

448
00:41:22,041 --> 00:41:29,704
[SPEAKER_00]: In fiscal year 25, the amount of property taxes collected from new growth is estimated to be $2.5 million here in Medford.

449
00:41:31,394 --> 00:41:39,164
[SPEAKER_00]: Together with the statutory 2.5% increase, the total fiscal year 25 property tax revenue increase is approximately 4.3%.

450
00:41:39,605 --> 00:41:46,253
[SPEAKER_00]: The August PCE, which is the Fed's preferential inflation, was 2.2%.

451
00:41:46,313 --> 00:41:47,114
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the annual change.

452
00:41:49,857 --> 00:41:57,003
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, the city is increasing property tax revenue by over 2% above inflation in fiscal year 25.

453
00:41:57,483 --> 00:42:04,888
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is indeed a myth that Proposition 2.5 implies that Medford cannot increase revenue fast enough to account for inflation.

454
00:42:05,449 --> 00:42:16,337
[SPEAKER_00]: The key word, as I've been pointing out repeatedly in several city council meetings, is economic growth, something that the city government should focus relentlessly on achieving.

455
00:42:16,903 --> 00:42:21,492
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last thing that I want to mention related to 25% is not 2.5%.

456
00:42:22,374 --> 00:42:27,363
[SPEAKER_00]: Every resident has seen huge cost increases as well in everyday expenses.

457
00:42:28,597 --> 00:42:38,225
[SPEAKER_00]: food, fuel, just all sorts, home maintenance, all rents, all sorts of activities, services, goods, et cetera.

458
00:42:38,466 --> 00:42:40,307
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just think it's not funny to laugh.

459
00:42:41,308 --> 00:42:45,111
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, once it's like nonchalantly, oh, 25% is not 2.5%.

460
00:42:45,992 --> 00:42:49,095
[SPEAKER_00]: People, you know, they have trouble getting to the end of the month.

461
00:42:49,195 --> 00:42:52,137
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think it's anything, there's anything funny about that.

462
00:42:52,217 --> 00:42:53,238
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for listening.

463
00:42:53,258 --> 00:42:55,080
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

464
00:43:03,902 --> 00:43:04,683
[SPEAKER_08]: We had a motion on the floor.

465
00:43:06,004 --> 00:43:09,287
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to approve and send to committee.

466
00:43:09,627 --> 00:43:10,908
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to regular meeting.

467
00:43:11,208 --> 00:43:13,590
[SPEAKER_08]: Refer out of committee to the regular meeting.

468
00:43:13,971 --> 00:43:17,153
[SPEAKER_08]: Seconded by Councilor Callahan.

469
00:43:17,173 --> 00:43:18,355
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a little more discussion.

470
00:43:18,375 --> 00:43:19,536
[SPEAKER_08]: Chief of staff Nazarian.

471
00:43:19,836 --> 00:43:21,918
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much for entertaining me in the middle of a motion.

472
00:43:22,218 --> 00:43:23,199
[SPEAKER_01]: Just wanted to confirm.

473
00:43:23,319 --> 00:43:28,083
[SPEAKER_01]: I've, I've been able to confirm with the parties that we have no understanding of

474
00:43:28,570 --> 00:43:32,353
[SPEAKER_01]: any type of delay as it pertains to the override relative to negotiations.

475
00:43:33,314 --> 00:43:35,976
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that's a misunderstanding or incorrect information.

476
00:43:36,857 --> 00:43:37,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

477
00:43:37,137 --> 00:43:37,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

478
00:43:42,181 --> 00:43:42,542
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

479
00:43:43,462 --> 00:43:51,069
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion of Councilor Leming, seconded by Councilor Callahan, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

480
00:43:54,712 --> 00:43:55,232
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Callahan?

481
00:43:55,452 --> 00:43:55,592
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

482
00:43:58,274 --> 00:43:58,474
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

483
00:43:58,494 --> 00:43:59,936
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

484
00:43:59,956 --> 00:44:00,016
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

485
00:44:06,028 --> 00:44:17,075
[SPEAKER_12]: I think you have, I just got a text message, Mr. Clerk, that maybe I'm out of line, but there's people trying to get on the Zoom that had questions with that response.

486
00:44:17,435 --> 00:44:25,421
[SPEAKER_12]: But like I said, I will move this forward and with a yes vote until we get more information.

487
00:44:25,461 --> 00:44:27,422
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President.

488
00:44:27,562 --> 00:44:28,263
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, thank you.

489
00:44:28,863 --> 00:44:29,584
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, oh yeah, thanks.

490
00:44:33,723 --> 00:44:39,985
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, no, it's Harold McGilvrey, the negotiating from the police department wanted to get on.

491
00:44:40,165 --> 00:44:40,725
[SPEAKER_08]: We're in the middle.

492
00:44:40,745 --> 00:44:41,326
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, okay.

493
00:44:41,346 --> 00:44:41,506
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

494
00:44:42,066 --> 00:44:42,506
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

495
00:44:42,546 --> 00:44:42,806
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry.

496
00:44:42,826 --> 00:44:43,947
[SPEAKER_12]: So it would be yes.

497
00:44:44,227 --> 00:44:44,487
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

498
00:44:46,928 --> 00:44:48,748
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

499
00:44:49,248 --> 00:44:49,588
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

500
00:44:49,608 --> 00:44:52,109
[SPEAKER_08]: 70 affirmative, none negative motion passes.

501
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:54,510
[SPEAKER_08]: Any further discussion?

502
00:44:54,530 --> 00:45:00,332
[SPEAKER_08]: We could talk about average new growth plus two and a half percent being around 3.25 to which is

503
00:45:03,598 --> 00:45:08,722
[SPEAKER_08]: about 20% of 25%, but no one wants to hear me talk about percents.

504
00:45:09,482 --> 00:45:10,823
[SPEAKER_08]: We just don't have enough money to run the city.

505
00:45:11,624 --> 00:45:16,067
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion adjourned by Councilor Lazzaro, seconded by Councilor Leming.

506
00:45:16,087 --> 00:45:16,227
[SPEAKER_08]: Ms.

507
00:45:16,247 --> 00:45:16,948
[SPEAKER_08]: Clerk, please call the roll.

508
00:45:22,832 --> 00:45:23,012
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

509
00:45:27,656 --> 00:45:27,876
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

510
00:45:30,558 --> 00:45:30,778
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

511
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:31,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

512
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:32,940
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

513
00:45:41,403 --> 00:45:42,704
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry, Mr. Clerk, did you call my name?

514
00:45:45,166 --> 00:45:51,192
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, I'd say no, I wanna hear more of what Council President is saying.

515
00:45:51,212 --> 00:45:52,673
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't worry about his percentages.

516
00:45:53,874 --> 00:45:55,696
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, Councilor Tseng.

517
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:03,223
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, 60 affirmative, one absent, motion passes, meeting is adjourned.
