    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=253.997s">Thank</a>  you, Council President. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=255.559s">Quick</a>  question. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=256.62s">Is</a>  there anybody from the administration available to speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=262.626s">The</a>  chief of staff or someone else from the mayor's office?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=266.946s">I</a>  don't see the chief of staff or the mayor present, but Director Riggi is gonna go check in that office right now and see if they can pop over.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=276.508s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=277.969s">I</a>  have one question that I was informed by another city department that they were told that they needed to stop their negotiations because of fear of <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=292.881s">the</a>  outcome of the override so they didn't want to commit, I believe, to move forward with any issues with funding moving forward until they know what happens in November. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=306.75s">So</a>  I'm a little curious if that's the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=310.873s">Maybe</a>  we should look at, I know there are some issues that we see that are on here now that I wouldn't object to because I know it's time sensitive. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=322.781s">If</a>  it's something that's really needed, I think we should move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=325.283s">But</a>  if there are concerns with the override vote and funding moving forward, that they're holding off negotiations, then I think it's something we need to talk about, Council President. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=340.614s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=342.135s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=343.496s">Any</a>  other questions or comments by members of the Council before we move into the specific items? <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=351.041s">Seeing</a>  none, while we wait for Director Riggi to return, we'll start. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=356.208s">We'll</a>  go in order. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=356.849s">We'll</a>  start with the water heater at the Brooks School. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=358.631s">We'll</a>  go to Assistant Superintendent Cushing, if you could give us a little information on the project and see if we have any questions from members of the council.</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=370.094s">Good</a>  evening, thank you very much for having me here tonight on behalf of the Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=375.158s">Approximately</a>  last May, the original-to-the-building hot water heater at the Brooks Elementary School failed. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=382.623s">It</a>  is the last of that generation of schools to have its original hot water heater. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=388.707s">We</a>  are working with the Office of Sustainability on an overall HVAC program for the McGlynn and the Andrews schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=398.23s">Those</a>  schools are at full replacement for their air conditioning systems. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=402.132s">It's</a>  another topic down the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=405.808s">We</a>  were able to loop in this project with the owners project manager and the designers who have worked at Medford High School previously the designers design the hot water heater for Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=419.083s">So</a>  we're able to loop this in as part of a high energy efficiency project, the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=425.309s">The</a>  school committee would like full electrification to get 100% away from fossil fuels in connection with the Medford stated goals for sustainability moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=437.276s">The</a>  costs of that were extraordinarily sobering and exorbitant. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=443.7s">So</a>  we have gone with a condensing hot water heater that is 96% efficient. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=451.645s">and</a>  while still does use fossil fuels, given the costs, is the wise decision for Medford to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=461.493s">We've</a>  been working with both the Office of Sustainability, Director Riggi, on this project for the last six months or so to really move us forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=470.92s">And</a>  by six months, that dates back to our work on the HVAC program. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=474.943s">And</a>  then once this failed, we moved this project into the mainline.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=480.52s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=481.5s">Any</a>  questions for Superintendent Cushing? <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=489.743s">Seeing</a>  none, I have one. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=490.683s">Oh,</a>  Councilor Lazzaro.</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=493.544s">I</a>  am curious if you know how long these pieces of equipment last.</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=498.526s">I</a>  will editorialize and say not as long as we would like, but the lifespan is seen as 10 to 15 years.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=507.269s">Got</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=507.769s">I</a>  have two questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=509.07s">One</a>  was, <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=510.427s">What</a>  did the, you know, we're looking at 267,000 here for this system. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=515.391s">What</a>  did the all electric system, what were the estimates coming in for that?</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=519.214s">So</a>  I can't, our initial estimates for this system all in, we're in the neighborhood of $200,000 as of this past Friday, when we got the initial quotes and I received the quotes actually in hand today, we were anticipating $200,000 all in. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=538.569s">design,</a>  construction management, and purchase and installation of all equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=542.891s">As</a>  you see before you today, that quote is with a 10% construction contingency. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=548.934s">It</a>  significantly exceeds $200,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=550.335s">The</a>  all electric <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=555.477s">equipment</a>  was in the neighborhood of $349,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=556.958s">That</a>  was before we went out to quote. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=561.279s">Those</a>  were the estimates of JLL and B2Q. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=566.221s">It</a>  was $349,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=567.702s">I</a>  will say that that was far more than we were anticipating even for this system.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=575.304s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=576.945s">And</a>  it sounds like we were able to make the initial water heaters last 20 years or so.</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=583.57s">So</a>  this is the last one to fail. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=586.231s">I've</a>  been new in this role for about the last 16, 18 months, so I don't have the timing on those others. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=594.175s">But</a>  from what I understand from Director McLaughlin is that they have all failed previously, and they were replaced with in-kind, high efficiency, but not 96% efficient. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=607.021s">But</a>  they've been replaced with in-kind. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=610.723s">gas-fired,</a>  as this will be gas-fired, but this being a condensing hot water heater, has significant efficiency savings. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=619.788s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=620.108s">And</a>  this will be the way we move as the others, you know, now we're in this cycle of, you know, on the clock for all other building systems.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=629.153s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=629.993s">Council</a>  Desiro.</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=631.694s">This</a>  is a question generally for how we do these appropriations, is are we approving the <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=640.752s">amount</a>  that they're authorized to offer, or is this the amount that it will cost? <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=646.593s">Like,</a>  is this real numbers? <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=649.914s">This</a>  may be different for each of these.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=651.634s">Before</a>  we go to bid, we have to authorize funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=654.754s">So</a>  the authorization is based on the estimate.</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=657.295s">So</a>  this is based on the estimate. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=658.635s">It's</a>  not like writing a check right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=660.675s">Some</a>  of this money may remain in the account.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=663.956s">I</a>  think if the bid comes in under the appropriated amount, then the balance reverts to the fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=668.457s">This</a>  is the most it could cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=670.37s">Well,</a>  this is the, I mean, unless the bids come in higher. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=673.252s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=673.753s">So</a>  this is what I think the best estimate for authorization and then the bidding process will determine the final cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=679.878s">Is</a>  that correct?</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=680.758s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=681.359s">And</a>  this follows under Chapter 25A. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=686.283s">So</a>  this is considered an efficiency upgrade. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=690.606s">So</a>  as long as we don't exceed $300,000, there's some flexibility with bids, but we have requested <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=698.552s">of</a>  JLL and B2Q to examine a third option, if possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=707.814s">We</a>  have received two quotes thus far, which under Chapter 25A, they fall under the $300,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=716.235s">But</a>  we have requested a third quote because the costs are sobering. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=724.297s">Got</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=726.488s">It</a>  also requires, this project also requires a significant amount of electrical upgrades to the building to be able to make this new piece of equipment function. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=737.339s">So</a>  that's also one of the hidden costs as opposed to just swapping with an in-kind <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=744.768s">Um,</a>  hot water heater, which could be an easy swap, but does nothing to move Medford towards its climate goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=753.935s">Or</a>  does, I shouldn't, does very little.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=757.117s">Councilor</a>  Lazzaro.</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=758.558s">Sorry,</a>  I'm sorry about all these questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=761.461s">Does</a>  this imply further issues like this because all the elementary schools were built at the same time and everything would presumably be failing at the same time?</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=772.929s">I</a>  think, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=774.926s">You</a>  know, buildings are approaching 25 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=780.592s">Director</a>  Riggi can probably speak far better than this than I can as a primarily academic leader. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=786.838s">But</a>  learning fast on the job, that's about half life for buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=792.264s">And</a>  while we like to think of these as still quote unquote the new schools, <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=797.809s">The</a>  reality is that they are approaching midlife and building systems are not an infinite thing, similar to our homes, but they are systems that will need replacement, updating, and continual upkeep and maintenance is a critical aspect to all of these systems, as well as proper training and all those types of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=825.489s">So</a>  the answer is building systems have a lifespan and we're halfway through that. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=832.231s">We're</a>  beyond the lifespan and halfway through the lifespan of these buildings.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=837.573s">From</a>  what Mr. Cushing said, the hot water heaters and all the other new buildings that early 2000s buildings have already been replaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=848.137s">But</a>  the HVAC systems and Mr. Director, if you want to come up and say anything about the <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=853.052s">general</a>  condition. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=853.692s">I</a>  know we've talked a lot about the middle schools, HVAC being a significant investment that's needed.</p>

    <p>[Riggi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=858.433s">Part</a>  of my new role, which was granted by the school committee when they finalized the vote two weeks ago, I think, is I will be looking at all building systems in all school buildings and working with school staff to develop a plan for maintenance and also <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=878.477s">get</a>  a schedule of replacements that we may need in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=882.841s">So</a>  we're not surprised by large amounts, so we can start planning properly for when we think systems will go, and it will be much easier to budget that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=894.152s">Councilor</a>  Lazzaro.</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=895.733s">My</a>  main concern in asking that was about the upgrades to the electrical systems and sort of more broad-based issues that might start coming up, and if there <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=904.537s">probably</a>  this is already something that's on your radar if that's something that you've been talking about just prior to piece by piece these things start to fail and then we have to go back and look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=917.656s">electrical</a>  system updates?</p>

    <p>[Riggi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=919.538s">As</a>  you look at the new equipment and the more efficient it becomes, the more power it's going to require. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=926.542s">So</a>  hopefully we won't run into these problems, but we may run into the problems and we'll have to address them as part of the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=934.367s">But</a>  then the school is at a benefit because they have better electrical service.</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=939.49s">If</a>  I may, I'm glad to hear that there's sort of a comprehensive plan in place that you're <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=946.061s">looking</a>  at and thinking about these systems. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=947.522s">So</a>  that's encouraging. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=949.043s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=951.985s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=952.826s">Any</a>  further questions on this item? <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=954.467s">We'll</a>  go to Vice President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=958.59s">Thank</a>  you to President Barras. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=959.811s">Thank</a>  you so much for being with us today to give us some context on this item. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=966.356s">As</a>  has been discussed, it's always sobering to hear of having to potentially put on the table a little bit more than we initially thought would have to be budgeted. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=975.342s">You</a>  know, unfortunately, we're in a fiscal environment where that is happening across the board because the cost of all sorts of infrastructural tools, materials and services are more expensive than they've been. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=986.388s">You</a>  know, when these estimates were made several years in the past due to inflation and other factors. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=990.35s">And</a>  I think that this is one of those scenarios where, you know, it never feels great to have to spend more than we had initially forecast. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=998.214s">But</a>  this is still a non-negotiable and I think it is well worth <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1003.317s">spending</a>  a little bit more to make sure that what we are investing in is more resilient for the future when we know these systems will, you know, have to be maintained, have to be upgraded. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1013.226s">And</a>  if we're going to be putting money on the table at all, I'd rather it be getting us closer to our climate goals and be a part of a new, more resilient system for our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1021.494s">You</a>  already covered the questions that I had. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1022.775s">Thank</a>  you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1024.016s">And</a>  I would be happy to motion to approve this.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1029.309s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1029.829s">I</a>  think we'll see where we are at the end of the presentations and hopefully we can refer items out to the regular meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1036.835s">Seeing</a>  no further questions, Mr. Superintendent, thank you for answering them. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1040.478s">We'll</a>  move to the next item.</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1041.899s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1042.8s">Next</a>  item is roadway patching in the amount of $112,728. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1044.962s">And</a>  that I believe is our city engineer.</p>

    <p>[Wartella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1055.947s">Hello.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1056.307s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1057.348s">My</a>  name is Owen Wartella. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1058.709s">I'm</a>  the city engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1060.69s">We're</a>  requesting $112,738 for some roadway patching that came in over our estimate when we went out to bid. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1073.069s">basically</a>  the cost of asphalt has gone up close to $10 per square yard over what we had estimated, and our estimates were from earlier this spring and early summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1084.695s">We'd</a>  like to do all the roads, and if the only other option would be to re-bid, we wouldn't get the roadways done this year, it'd be in the spring, so we're trying to move this forward before it gets a little too cold.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1100.993s">Any</a>  questions for City Engineer? <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1105.338s">Councilor</a>  Kelly?</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1107.44s">Yeah,</a>  do you have any more specifics about like which which roadways are going to be worked on?</p>

    <p>[Wartella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1111.624s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1112.265s">We</a>  are <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1114.918s">Planning</a>  to do two types of restaurant, we're taking two approaches here. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1120.623s">One</a>  is going to be the other half of what national grid started, there's four roads Wicker have Bradbury have Columbia road and picture of that we're going to pay the other half of the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1132.054s">that</a>  they had already started this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1133.775s">And</a>  then the other approach that we're gonna do is we're doing arterial roadways, large roadways, and we're designating 800 square yards for each of those roadways, and that's gonna be Main Street, Salem Street, Boston Ave, and Freedom Way.</p>

    <p>[Nesson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1154.878s">Am</a>  I allowed to cheer? <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1156.119s">Is</a>  that allowed?</p>

    <p>[Wartella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1159.24s">We're</a>  trying to get it done.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1161.301s">That</a>  would be miraculous. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1162.622s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1163.542s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1164.923s">Any</a>  other questions on the roadway patching? <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1170.045s">Seeing</a>  none, I have one. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1172.206s">When</a>  we say that the square yard cost went up $10 a square yard, what is that from and what is that to?</p>

    <p>[Wartella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1179.376s">From</a>  30 are the our earlier estimates this year when we were putting bids out and getting them back The contractors were averaging around $35 a square yard now The lowest bid was 45 a square yard.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1195.362s">All</a>  right Do you have any understanding as to why that's happening or I think asphalt is expensive I</p>

    <p>[Wartella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1208.877s">I</a>  mean, no, no, no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1210.618s">I</a>  hear you. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1211.238s">I</a>  mean, it could be a whole like social economic, you know, wormhole that we go down, but I, you know, I, it, the cost has gone up.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1218.601s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1218.841s">I</a>  just didn't know if there was any specific supply chain stuff that you might know about that we might not know about. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1223.083s">Um,</a>  but I will just note that, uh, 10, you know, the percentage change there is huge. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1229.185s">It's</a>  almost 25% higher than we thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1230.326s">And</a>  25 is a lot more than 2.5. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1241.926s">All</a>  right, any other questions regarding roadway patching? <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1247.027s">Seeing</a>  none, I will go to the next item. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1249.588s">Mr.</a>  Randazzo, replacement of light poles in the city parking lots in the amount of $105,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1252.989s">What</a>  do we got, Steve?</p>

    <p>[Randazzo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1255.209s">Good</a>  evening, council. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1256.669s">Thank</a>  you for your service to the city and thank you for your time hearing me on this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1263.291s">It</a>  was brought to my attention that we have a substantial amount of deterioration on streetlight poles that are all along Clippership and in the City Hall parking lot and along behind the square in the parking lot there as well, where we had a pole come down on its own. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1284.362s">And</a>  once I was aware of the severity through <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1292.25s">Todd</a>  was working on one of his own projects and was able to get some photos, which we have attached. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1300.674s">And</a>  it's something that I think should be addressed sooner than later. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1306.576s">It's</a>  not like we can remove the ones that are in worse shape than others. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1311.278s">It's</a>  really hard to tell underlying issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1314.699s">You</a>  can't really tell. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1317.18s">I</a>  think it's the best thing to do is to do them all at once. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1320.221s">They</a>  were all installed at the same time, and it was roughly 40 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1325.003s">So</a>  they've pretty much exceeded their shelf life, and I just want to make sure that we don't have another issue and provide public safety.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1334.506s">Got</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1335.566s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1335.987s">We'll</a>  go to Councilor Leming.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1338.49s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1339.49s">Yeah,</a>  I see these photos and they look horrifying. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1342.852s">So</a>  thank you for putting in this request. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1345.513s">Just</a>  only question, you said that these are 40 years old, are the new telephone poles that you plan to install, what is the expected shelf life for those?</p>

    <p>[Randazzo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1357.339s">That</a>  I wouldn't be able to give you an answer on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1361.082s">I</a>  think it all determined on the weather factors and the elements involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1367.486s">I</a>  don't think you'll get a basis of a shelf life on a warranty purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1372.729s">But</a>  other than that, I wouldn't be able to give you an honest answer at this time.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1378.293s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1380.675s">Any</a>  other questions for Mr. Rendazzo? <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1382.296s">I'll</a>  go to Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1384.901s">Uh,</a>  thank you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1386.662s">Uh,</a>  Mr. Randazzo again. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1387.702s">Thank</a>  you for everything you do. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1389.023s">I</a>  think that, uh, you are your, um, history and saving money for our community is second to none. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1397.206s">And</a>  I think that everyone should realize that. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1400.467s">But</a>  my question is, along with this, I've I've gotten many phone calls from the business district, and I know what some of the changes in parking in Medford Square that the discussion has been that there's going to be <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1414.673s">you</a>  know, the parking for the business community, um, on, um, on Salem Street next to that parking lot next to the I believe it's a national grid building their substation building. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1428.966s">One</a>  of the concerns that the businesses has that there is no lighting in that lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1434.011s">Is</a>  that been discussed by any chance? <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1436.753s">Um,</a>  we are office.</p>

    <p>[Randazzo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1439.987s">Councilor,</a>  we did install lighting a few years back. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1444.548s">They</a>  are floodlights, and we've also had to angle them because of the residents on the other side of the parking lot were complaining about the light intruding upon their privacy. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1456.872s">So</a>  we had to angle them down. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1460.473s">When</a>  you angle them down, you're taking away the distance of the light, decreasing the effectiveness of the light itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1470.407s">But</a>  other than that, there has been no talk of adding any additional lighting.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1475.413s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1475.573s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1476.053s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1480.619s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1482.701s">I</a>  had one question just when the poll came down, what was the, did it hit anything? <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1488.688s">What</a>  was the impact of it?</p>

    <p>[Randazzo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1491.018s">It</a>  did not hit anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1492.259s">I</a>  was out on medical leave when this happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1494.861s">I</a>  didn't realize it came down on its own until roughly about a month ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1501.045s">And</a>  that's when I took action with this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1505.807s">I</a>  thought it was knocked down and there was gonna be an accident report to claim funding like typically would happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1512.512s">But</a>  unfortunately it came down on its own.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1515.162s">All</a>  right, and was it on a sidewalk, parking lot, roadway?</p>

    <p>[Randazzo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1518.924s">It</a>  landed in the parking lot over behind where the old CVS was.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1523.106s">Okay,</a>  all right. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1525.507s">And</a>  I know you weren't around, did it happen late at night or?</p>

    <p>[Randazzo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1528.549s">I</a>  don't recall.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1529.829s">You</a>  don't know, yeah, it's okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1531.951s">Just</a>  obviously wanna not have light poles falling on cars or people or anything else, so.</p>

    <p>[Randazzo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1539.133s">It's</a>  a very similar situation to what happened on Freedom Way, going to the schools, all the lighting that had the same type of deterioration. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1548.076s">And</a>  it's not like we could just take down the ones that are worse than others, because then you increase the risk of now it's dark and there's a public safety issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1557.48s">You</a>  can't really juggle the two. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1560.541s">So</a>  I think it's prudent to do all of them at once.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1563.782s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1564.743s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1566.556s">Seeing</a>  no further questions, we'll move to our next item, which is the elevator repair unforeseen costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1572.726s">We'll</a>  go to Director Riggi.</p>

    <p>[Riggi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1577.924s">I</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1579.324s">Also,</a>  thank you for your patience while the elevator has been down a little longer than we expected. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1585.266s">Part</a>  of that is that we found that we had to upgrade a lot of the electrical systems for the elevator in the elevator machine room, and we had to upgrade our fire alarm system here in City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1598.389s">So</a>  now, if there is a smoke detector that's tripped for the elevator, the elevator will actually stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1605.891s">and</a>  signal the fire department so they can come here. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1608.852s">So</a>  that were the unforeseen costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1612.952s">We</a>  didn't realize that the code changed that drastically until we started getting into the project.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1619.613s">Got</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1620.874s">Any</a>  questions from members of the council?</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1624.714s">Mr.</a>  President, if I can.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1626.034s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1627.095s">A</a>  question on that topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1632.776s">Is</a>  the elevator still currently out?</p>

    <p>[Riggi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1636.581s">Yes,</a>  we're hoping tomorrow the elevator company and the fire alarm company are here ensuring that their programming work together. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1645.766s">And</a>  if that happens, then we will contact the state to have it inspected and we can get it back up and running. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1651.668s">So</a>  if that all works, hopefully we can get it back up and running next week.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1654.83s">Okay,</a>  I bring this up because last night we had a very important meeting and I think everybody unanimously decided that having a community meeting with our senior citizens that we're having some confusion on what the debt exclusion and the override questions were. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1672.585s">And</a>  I get had a few phone calls today. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1675.567s">uh</a>  from uh representing people that are representing that uh our senior citizens and they were very concerned that uh will the elevators be functioning on october 15th and if not i think we need to <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1690.659s">seriously</a>  consider moving that committee to the whole meeting to a location where senior citizens can attend that meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1699.163s">I</a>  think it defeats the purpose of what we agreed on yesterday. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1703.865s">If</a>  we have people that can't climb stairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1706.746s">Is</a>  the 15th something that can work?</p>

    <p>[Riggi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1713.152s">Well,</a>  I will tomorrow and if I can also authorize overtime to have the elevator inspector come out during overtime. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1722.223s">That'd</a>  be that'd be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1723.825s">And</a>  I can, I can use that. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1725.828s">I</a>  will report back once I find out tomorrow, if everything went well, the timeline.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1734.244s">Great,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1736.726s">Any</a>  other questions for Director Riggi on the elevator?</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1740.409s">Mr.</a>  President, if we can, if we just have the clerk, if we can, as soon as Mr. Riggi gets us an update, if we can update the council with that, that'd be greatly appreciated. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1751.197s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1752.518s">When</a>  you have some info, if you could send us an email, we'll get it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1755.541s">Great,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1758.483s">All</a>  right, next item we have is the, <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1764.537s">Of</a>  course, I lost my screen here. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1766.82s">Is</a>  it Brooks Estate? <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1768.582s">Brooks</a>  Estate, great. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1769.903s">I'm</a>  familiar with this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1771.225s">We</a>  do have our Brooks Estate president, Carly Nessen here. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1776.891s">Welcome,</a>  Carly. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1777.752s">I</a>  can go quickly through just to say that this is a request for $55,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1785.42s">for</a>  repairs at the Brooks Estate. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1788.483s">The</a>  breakdown of that, I'm sure Carly can go into more details, but there are some roof repairs and snow repairs and insulation and radiator work that need to happen as well as drywall repairs, walls and ceilings in the caretaker spaces and floors <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1807.136s">in</a>  the caretaker spaces as well as some pest control in the attic. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1813.359s">And</a>  that is important because we are seeking new caretakers at the estate to oversee and watch and keep safe the city property that is the Brooks Estate and the Shepherd Brooks Manor. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1826.326s">So</a>  with that, I will go to Carly Nessen, president of the Medford Brooks Estate Land Trust.</p>

    <p>[Nesson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1833.589s">Thank</a>  you so much and thanks for <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1837.034s">hearing</a>  this I mean it's it would be a great deal to us to shore up the manor before winter hits especially that's kind of precipitating the timing of this as well not only the new caretaker search that we are currently undergoing and getting the space refreshed for them but of course the winterization piece <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1855.873s">of</a>  making sure that our roof is not leaking and that we don't have a larger bill next year for roof repairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1861.636s">So</a>  part of the funding we're asking for is all about the roof repair and making sure we have some insulation and a tighter envelope for us this winter. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1872.422s">And</a>  then of course, just that refresh with the painting and the plastering as president council bears mentioned.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1877.825s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1881.947s">Any</a>  questions for President Nesson? <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1887.759s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli, I see a hand raised.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1892.401s">Forgive</a>  me, that's a late hand Council President.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1896.402s">Got</a>  it, I'll go to Councilor Leming.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1899.063s">Thank</a>  you, I'd just like to know, could this funding have come from the CPA and are there other Brooks Estate projects at the moment with active CPA funding?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1915.841s">I</a>  will go to Carly on active projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1917.763s">I</a>  think I'll have to unmute you. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1920.966s">This</a>  is preventative maintenance, so it doesn't fall under CPA.</p>

    <p>[Nesson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1929.953s">We</a>  don't have any active CPA projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1931.614s">We</a>  just finished up the Grove Wall, Grove Street Wall, and that was the most recent. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1935.217s">This</a>  falls out of cycle with that because of its timeliness with winter is probably the answer of why it's not covered by CPA.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1943.649s">Got</a>  it, so this is an historic preservation. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1945.771s">I</a>  think that clarified my question. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1947.912s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Nesson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1948.133s">Yeah,</a>  correct.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1949.714s">Maintenance</a>  and emergency repairs.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1952.576s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1955.619s">Great,</a>  any other questions regarding the Brooks Estate item, the repairs at the Brooks Estate? <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1965.006s">Seeing</a>  none, we do have the Chief of Staff, who is, I'm sure, working diligently on another thing right now, and if you need a minute, <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1972.79s">I</a>  can give you a minute, but Councilor Scarpelli did have a question, I think, potentially related to the fire item that came off the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1988.665s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli, if you wanna restate the question.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1990.647s">No,</a>  thank you, Council President. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1993.03s">No,</a>  it's not the fire. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1997.287s">I</a>  was, uh, was talking to someone from the negotiating team from our method police department and they were told during negotiations, I believe that negotiations will be delayed, um, for the fact that the override, um, might be in question. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2013.86s">So</a>  because of that fact that we need to, um, hold off until we get more understanding or, or see what the vote would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2022.626s">And,</a>  um, <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2025.157s">in</a>  November to move forward with their negotiations. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2028.9s">Uh,</a>  the second part of that question is that if that is an issue, um, I'm under the impression that, uh, there's a negotiating line item. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2039.407s">And</a>  if if that's not the case, could you educate me? <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2043.149s">And</a>  if there is a case that that it is, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2047.452s">if</a>  you can let us know what we are with that as well because in my in my capacity when there's negotiations there's understanding that most municipalities have a negotiated line item that has funding already set aside and if we're holding that out <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2068.935s">because</a>  of fear that the override will not move forward and needing that funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2075.801s">It</a>  could be construed of maybe as a fair tactic if the administration is moving in a for yes vote or it then leaves me a little befuddled if we don't have a line item when we negotiate with our union members. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2092.796s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2097.554s">you.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2097.674s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2098.375s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2098.635s">Chief</a>  Stephanie's area.</p>

    <p>[Nazarian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2100.576s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears through you to Councilor Scarapelli and frankly to the entire council. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2105.52s">Um,</a>  you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2108.402s">I</a>  don't I don't entirely follow the nexus, and I don't believe this is a matter on the agenda, but I will answer the question of the council would like me to answer the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2116.308s">I</a>  have no answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2116.989s">I</a>  have no issue with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2124.52s">police</a>  department negotiations being delayed relative to the override has any merit. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2132.149s">So</a>  I don't know where that's coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2133.85s">I</a>  don't believe that's a fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2136.613s">I</a>  certainly can ask questions, but I have no information on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2139.917s">And</a>  I don't believe that there is any basis or truth to that statement.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2144.102s">Okay,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Nazarian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2145.323s">Misunderstanding.</a> </p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2147.219s">Okay,</a>  just with that, though, I just, I think it is a direct correlation of what we're asking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2153.365s">I</a>  think that. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2154.747s">If</a>  that is, and we do find that until until we get to our next regular meeting, where we will vote on these, these initiatives, I think that. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2164.369s">the</a>  understanding that if we're looking at, and this is the case, if you do find research and they do come back and says, no, we did mention that. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2175.612s">And</a>  if that's the case, then it's relevant for tonight's meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2181.094s">And</a>  the fact that if we do have questions about our financial question marks after the override and where, <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2191.397s">we're</a>  talking we're we're discussing this with a negotiating team then i think that everything has to be on the table when the mayor presents any sort of funding for anything right now um like i said there are things that are presented today that when it comes to a vote i i don't think i can hesitate because i think it's needed but there are some other things that we can look at and say hey i would like i would motion to sever and then look at the different options because of <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2218.955s">uh</a>  the need of funding if that's the case moving forward so i think there's a direct correlation of what i was told and what is on the agenda tonight so thank you mr president and thank you chief of staff nazarian thank you and thank you for being here councillor Leming um</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2238.732s">No,</a>  I didn't entirely follow that. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2241.633s">I</a>  would motion to approve and send this to regular meeting.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2245.775s">On</a>  the motion of council, I'm going to refer the paper with the items to the regular meeting, seconded by Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2250.998s">Any</a>  further discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2254.979s">We</a>  have a raised hand for participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2258.381s">Give</a>  me one second here. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2259.601s">We'll</a>  go to Gaston Fiore. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2263.043s">Or</a>  Councilor Scarpelli, is that, do you want to go?</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2267.952s">yeah</a>  i apologize i just want to make sure if it's if i'm confusing councillor uh Leming i can clarify if he wants um the confusion is if there is an issue that's dealing with our city financial concerns and and one group or one situation is being um frozen for uh the the fear of <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2291.852s">lack</a>  of funding later on in November, then this would be a concern moving any money doctor to the next level, considering if there is <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2305.962s">some</a>  fear and I appreciate the chief of staff looking into it and hoping it's just a rumor, but I got it from a credible source. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2314.404s">That's</a>  actually part of the negotiating team that said that that did happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2318.885s">So</a>  I'd like to see maybe, maybe there's some misunderstanding there and get some corrections. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2323.806s">But</a>  if you're confused with that, I can clear it up if you have any questions for me.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2328.407s">I'll</a>  go to vice president Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2334.687s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2335.988s">Appreciate</a>  this discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2339.032s">I</a>  appreciate this discussion also being put in the context of the other budgeting tools that the Council goes through throughout the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2346.965s">It</a>  seems to me that the questions of negotiations are ones that the administration forecasts and creates its container for during the annual budgeting process, which we of course went through this past June and will again for FY26 starting next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2361.912s">And</a>  I also just want to remind the Council that the appropriations before us are from the capital, the capital stabilization fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2370.356s">So</a>  the money requests, the appropriation requests that are before us are <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2375.416s">limited</a>  to appropriation for capital spending purposes. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2378.417s">And</a>  they are very limited in that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2382.298s">These</a>  are not dollars that could be used for any purpose at all in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2385.999s">They</a>  are limited to capital expenditures. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2389.28s">And</a>  that is why we are considering infrastructural and maintenance projects before us this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2395.922s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2397.523s">Mr.</a>  President, if I can.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2399.54s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2401.303s">No,</a>  I understand that we have, we have, we, we can, we can respect, excuse me, we can, we can agree to disagree. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2411.477s">But</a>  again, I think it's important that, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2415.843s">if</a>  it does come to a climate when we need to petition to move funding around from different accounts, there are mechanisms that we could do that depending on what accounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2426.486s">So</a>  I would say everything would be open until we understand the true financial picture on November 5th. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2433.308s">So</a>  thank you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2437.61s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2438.03s">Go</a>  to public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2439.41s">Gaston</a>  Fiore. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2441.351s">I</a>  will ask you to unmute and you'll have three minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2443.411s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Fiore]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2447.486s">Thank</a>  you very much Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2449.589s">I</a>  would just like to clarify something related to the comment that was made that stated that 25% is a lot more than 2.5%. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2461.61s">And</a>  I would just would like to point out one myth that has been going around, and that is that Proposition 2.5 implies that cities cannot increase revenue fast enough to account for inflation. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2472.996s">That</a>  is false. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2474.237s">Proposition</a>  2.5 excludes four cases from the limitation on tax levy increases. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2479.899s">One</a>  such case is new growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2482.041s">In</a>  fiscal year 25, the amount of property taxes collected from new growth is estimated to be $2.5 million here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2491.394s">Together</a>  with the statutory 2.5% increase, the total fiscal year 25 property tax revenue increase is approximately 4.3%. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2499.605s">The</a>  August PCE, which is the Fed's preferential inflation, was 2.2%. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2506.313s">That's</a>  the annual change. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2509.857s">Therefore,</a>  the city is increasing property tax revenue by over 2% above inflation in fiscal year 25. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2517.483s">So</a>  it is indeed a myth that Proposition 2.5 implies that Medford cannot increase revenue fast enough to account for inflation. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2525.449s">The</a>  key word, as I've been pointing out repeatedly in several city council meetings, is economic growth, something that the city government should focus relentlessly on achieving. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2536.903s">And</a>  the last thing that I want to mention related to 25% is not 2.5%. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2542.374s">Every</a>  resident has seen huge cost increases as well in everyday expenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2548.597s">food,</a>  fuel, just all sorts, home maintenance, all rents, all sorts of activities, services, goods, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2558.466s">And</a>  I just think it's not funny to laugh. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2561.308s">You</a>  know, once it's like nonchalantly, oh, 25% is not 2.5%. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2565.992s">People,</a>  you know, they have trouble getting to the end of the month. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2569.195s">And</a>  I don't think it's anything, there's anything funny about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2572.217s">Thank</a>  you so much for listening. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2573.258s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2583.902s">We</a>  had a motion on the floor.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2586.004s">Motion</a>  to approve and send to committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2589.627s">Motion</a>  to regular meeting.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2591.208s">Refer</a>  out of committee to the regular meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2593.971s">Seconded</a>  by Councilor Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2597.173s">We</a>  have a little more discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2598.375s">Chief</a>  of staff Nazarian.</p>

    <p>[Nazarian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2599.836s">Thank</a>  you very much for entertaining me in the middle of a motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2602.218s">Just</a>  wanted to confirm. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2603.319s">I've,</a>  I've been able to confirm with the parties that we have no understanding of <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2608.57s">any</a>  type of delay as it pertains to the override relative to negotiations. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2613.314s">I</a>  believe that's a misunderstanding or incorrect information.</p>

    <p>[Riggi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2616.857s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2617.137s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2622.181s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2623.462s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Leming, seconded by Councilor Callahan, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2634.712s">Councilor</a>  Callahan? <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2635.452s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2638.274s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2638.494s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2639.956s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2646.028s">I</a>  think you have, I just got a text message, Mr. Clerk, that maybe I'm out of line, but there's people trying to get on the Zoom that had questions with that response. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2657.435s">But</a>  like I said, I will move this forward and with a yes vote until we get more information. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2665.461s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2667.562s">Okay,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2668.863s">Yeah,</a>  oh yeah, thanks. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2673.723s">Yeah,</a>  no, it's Harold McGilvrey, the negotiating from the police department wanted to get on.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2680.165s">We're</a>  in the middle.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2680.745s">Oh,</a>  okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2681.346s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2682.066s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2682.546s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2682.826s">So</a>  it would be yes.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2684.227s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2686.928s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2753.874s">All</a>  right, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2759.84s">Yes,</a>  60 affirmative, one absent, motion passes, meeting is adjourned.</p>
