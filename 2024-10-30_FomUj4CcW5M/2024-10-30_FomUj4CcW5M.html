    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1734.567s">Would</a>  you rather go first? <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1735.827s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1736.848s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1740.748s">and</a>  then we'll go to, I'm gonna read the response, we'll go to councilors, then we'll go to the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1746.572s">I</a>  have here to Council President Bears and honorable members of the council regarding the public participation petition respectfully submitted for your honorable body's consideration as additional information about activities concerning the municipally owned parking lot at 75 Riverside Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1765.144s">Clippership</a>  pop-up as of October 9th, the corner of the parking lot has been repurposed to create <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1773.453s">Oh,</a>  sorry, repurpose to create the clipper ship pop up park, the pop up is utilized by the city, particularly the recreation department for periodic programming and is otherwise open for passive recreation to the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1786.946s">To</a>  create the pop-up park, no parking spaces were lost. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1789.489s">The</a>  pop-up area was created from what was a previously redundant drive aisle and six parking spots. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1795.715s">To</a>  prevent any loss of parking, eight new parking spots were re-striped in the parking lot, resulting in a net positive for parking spaces overall. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1803.903s">Please</a>  see photos below demonstrating locations of eight new parking spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1810.123s">Request</a>  for proposals Medford Square, the city published an RFP request for proposal for three underutilized parcels behind City Hall on September 30th, 2024. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1820.511s">The</a>  city wants to garner interest from developers to explore what redevelopment options there would be for these three combined parcels, including mixed use buildings, affordable housing and parking structures. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1831.279s">The</a>  city will enter a long-term ground lease for up to 99 years with a qualified developer for these parcels. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1837.383s">The</a>  due date for responses is December 20th, 2024 at 1 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1842.026s">Community</a>  outreach for this project was conducted through focus groups and community meetings through the Transforming the Square project in partnership with Metropolitan Area Planning Council in 2023. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1852.071s">MAPC</a>  conducted research using previous plans and site visits of the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1855.933s">Please</a>  note that parking for our seniors is a top priority for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1859.675s">The</a>  mayor explicitly mentioned this in her greeting to developers before the walkthrough last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1866.451s">Construction</a>  employee parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1868.174s">Due</a>  to the large-scale construction project at 121 Riverside Avenue, the adjacent Clippership lot has seen an influx of commercial and personal vehicle parking to accommodate workers and staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1878.757s">As</a>  a result of this temporary parking situation, the mayor contacted Medford Housing Authority Director Jeffrey Driscoll to get a more complete breakdown of what vehicles are occupying spaces during the day, how long this disruption is anticipated and how a compromise can be reached to alleviate community concerns and allow accessibility to the worksite. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1897.464s">The</a>  mayor concluded that there were up to an additional 40 cars due to the lot construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1902.285s">Director</a>  Driscoll has been receptive and helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1904.386s">He</a>  reached out to the contractor for support <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1907.04s">Jim</a>  Silva, Special Project Coordinator, also visited the lot earlier last week and requested that the workers use the lower City Hall lot instead so that seniors had spots when visiting the Senior Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1917.272s">It</a>  is a work in progress to get the construction workers to relocate, but we are doing everything possible as parking for our seniors is our priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1923.939s">Thank</a>  you for your kind attention to this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1926.922s">And</a>  I'll recognize Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1930.144s">And</a>  thank you for Mrs. Tomaszczuk bringing forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1931.906s">I</a>  know I've talked to a few of our friends in the audience and I think there was some confusion first that people seem to thought it was about the pop-up park, but it's not about the pop-up park. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1943.435s">The</a>  issues and concerns are something that we'll hear again later on tonight is that the way we're doing business in Medford is that we're really not getting the community involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1955.325s">I</a>  know they wanna say the community gets involved, but the truth of the matter is <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1961.141s">Let</a>  me ask our seniors if we know that we have valuable land here. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1966.784s">And</a>  unfortunately, I think there has to be an understanding that we need some growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1972.326s">But</a>  if there was a partnership where we brought the process to the seniors and said, this is how we're going to look at the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1982.091s">We</a>  wanna make sure that all of your concerns are taken care of and get your input so you can share what you're afraid of. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1991.716s">and</a>  making sure that we fill those gaps. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1994.338s">I'm</a>  sure none of you have had that conversation with anybody from the city, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1997.721s">Correct</a>  me if I'm wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1999.202s">Okay,</a>  so this is what we're seeing right now in Medford, is that as we're going through our zoning changes, one thing we talked about was really going into the communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2009.069s">We</a>  put that in the RFP actually, about when we rezone, when we look at projects like this, we go into those communities, just like neighbor communities do when they do big projects like Assembly Row, <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2019.797s">and</a>  they do big projects like Union Square in Somerville, they actually bring city staff to the neighborhood where people come out and talk to you and you can share your concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2029.843s">So</a>  I'm hoping moving forward by coming to this podium, there is an issue, there is a concern, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2037.128s">I'm</a>  not gonna say that we don't need new growth and development. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2040.59s">I'm</a>  not gonna say that, I won't lie to you and tell you that I don't think that we need to use these parcels <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2046.204s">to</a>  make a change to really invest in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2049.467s">But</a>  at the same time, what we need is an understanding and a form of partnership where our seniors can say, okay, if you're going to take this lot, what lot are we going to build <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2064.375s">and</a>  to make sure that it's similar vicinity that our seniors can park and walk across the street or walk next door so we can accommodate all of the programs that you said are so important to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2076.246s">So</a>  I think moving forward, I think that we have a, you know, I hear you loud and clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2082.011s">I</a>  think that I'm going to advocate to make sure that as we move forward, especially with this RFP and these five parcels I heard that I think it's three, but <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2090.379s">I</a>  also told there was maybe five that are coming down the line that it's going to encompass the whole square. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2095.744s">So</a>  we're going to see drastic changes here. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2098.526s">And</a>  it seems like we're forgetting the most vulnerable people in our community, mostly our seniors, and saying, well, let's just move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2106.052s">So</a>  I'm welcoming. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2108.274s">I'll</a>  share my information, my phone number. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2110.556s">If</a>  you feel fear in any way, give me a call. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2113.738s">Let</a>  me at least try to be a voice as we go through this process, because unfortunately, it's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2119.631s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2119.951s">But</a>  I think that it could happen with a partnership. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2123.153s">So</a>  everybody's involved to make sure that all the concerns that you have are addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2129.036s">So</a>  you're not going to sleep thinking, are we going to lose the grieving program? <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2132.578s">We're</a>  going to lose the knitting program. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2134.059s">We're</a>  going to lose this program because there's nowhere to park. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2137.501s">So</a>  I think that's going to be important. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2138.902s">So</a>  I just want to share that with you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2141.003s">I</a>  think that from what I've talked to a few of the seniors offline, and I think after this conversation I shared with them, they felt a little bit better. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2151.388s">But</a>  I think that we really need a buy-in from the city administration to work with our seniors, not just bring you cookies and pizza on election week, but really sit down with you and say, hey, what do you really need? <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2162.774s">And</a>  making sure that your needs are met. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2164.255s">So</a>  thank you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2166.323s">Thank</a>  you Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2167.387s">Any</a>  further comments? <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2169.233s">Council</a>  Vice President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2172.11s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2172.87s">And</a>  I also want to appreciate the petitioner for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2175.771s">I</a>  think it's really important for us to use this forum for folks to have that additional opportunity to say, here are my concerns with the RFP in general, this zone in general, this project in general. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2190.095s">I</a>  think there's absolutely, you know, we thank you for, you know, again, voicing how important it is for, you know, everybody who needs access to the senior center and any, however they get there, whether it's by bus or by shuttle, by carpool, <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2201.758s">or</a>  by driving themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2203.819s">The</a>  senior center is so important to Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2206.361s">I'm</a>  heartened to see, you know, in the mayor's, in the memo from the planning department that that has been reiterated to some of the development, sorry, some of the developers who went on that site walk, that that's been said to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2217.949s">But</a>  I think it's important that we, you know, continue to reiterate this priority, which is a priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2222.592s">We</a>  have to make sure that people who need access to the senior center can continue to access it how they need to. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2229.197s">So</a>  we'll continue to help you emphasize that, and thank you for speaking to your concerns today.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2234.44s">Thank</a>  you, Vice President Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2235.4s">We'll</a>  go to Councilor Lazzaro.</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2238.122s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2238.863s">I</a>  also just wanted to reiterate that we appreciate the concerns, especially, I understand that every time I visited the Senior Center, it's an incredibly bustling place to visit. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2252.331s">All</a>  the activities are really well attended. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2256.233s">I</a>  know that mobility issues can be a big concern for folks who are there. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2260.519s">So</a>  I know that parking is very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2262.582s">And</a>  my hope would be that as the city reviews the proposals that parking is always and public parking parking that's available to be used. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2271.333s">would</a>  still be part of the buildings that they put there. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2274.757s">But</a>  Councilor Leming and I, we're members of the Resident Services Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2280.442s">And</a>  as part of that, we did a listening session at the Senior Center a few months ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2285.827s">It</a>  wasn't super well attended, but it was the only only the first one we did. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2288.79s">And</a>  we didn't have a chance to make it sort of a consistent thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2293.074s">But</a>  I would be excited to do that more often. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2295.737s">and</a>  have more opportunities for people to bring us what they're concerned about and tell us about the things like that, that are coming up more regularly that you're thinking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2304.659s">And</a>  maybe if we can make it something that perhaps rotating members of city council that can come to the senior center and hear concerns from people, we can look into that in resident services and talk more about it.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2316.202s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2319.193s">This</a>  is just a very brief comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2321.314s">So</a>  I do definitely hear what Marianne is saying about during any construction phase, it's likely that parking would be unavailable during that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2328.877s">But</a>  the RFP, just to really highlight this, the RFP does call for the construction of a parking garage in any developments that are created so long term. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2342.144s">ideally</a>  going by what the RFP says, this wouldn't affect parking availability in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2349.874s">So</a>  that's the idea, but I just wanted to, again, I'm hearing what Marianne is saying about the temporary unavailability during construction, but I did want to highlight that for folks in the room. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2358.404s">Thank</a>  you.</p>
