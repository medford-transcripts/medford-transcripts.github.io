    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1734.567s">Would</a>  you rather go first? <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1735.827s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1736.848s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1740.748s">and</a>  then we'll go to, I'm gonna read the response, we'll go to councilors, then we'll go to the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1746.572s">I</a>  have here to Council President Bears and honorable members of the council regarding the public participation petition respectfully submitted for your honorable body's consideration as additional information about activities concerning the municipally owned parking lot at 75 Riverside Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1765.144s">Clippership</a>  pop-up as of October 9th, the corner of the parking lot has been repurposed to create <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1773.453s">Oh,</a>  sorry, repurpose to create the clipper ship pop up park, the pop up is utilized by the city, particularly the recreation department for periodic programming and is otherwise open for passive recreation to the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1786.946s">To</a>  create the pop-up park, no parking spaces were lost. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1789.489s">The</a>  pop-up area was created from what was a previously redundant drive aisle and six parking spots. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1795.715s">To</a>  prevent any loss of parking, eight new parking spots were re-striped in the parking lot, resulting in a net positive for parking spaces overall. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1803.903s">Please</a>  see photos below demonstrating locations of eight new parking spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1810.123s">Request</a>  for proposals Medford Square, the city published an RFP request for proposal for three underutilized parcels behind City Hall on September 30th, 2024. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1820.511s">The</a>  city wants to garner interest from developers to explore what redevelopment options there would be for these three combined parcels, including mixed use buildings, affordable housing and parking structures. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1831.279s">The</a>  city will enter a long-term ground lease for up to 99 years with a qualified developer for these parcels. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1837.383s">The</a>  due date for responses is December 20th, 2024 at 1 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1842.026s">Community</a>  outreach for this project was conducted through focus groups and community meetings through the Transforming the Square project in partnership with Metropolitan Area Planning Council in 2023. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1852.071s">MAPC</a>  conducted research using previous plans and site visits of the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1855.933s">Please</a>  note that parking for our seniors is a top priority for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1859.675s">The</a>  mayor explicitly mentioned this in her greeting to developers before the walkthrough last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1866.451s">Construction</a>  employee parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1868.174s">Due</a>  to the large-scale construction project at 121 Riverside Avenue, the adjacent Clippership lot has seen an influx of commercial and personal vehicle parking to accommodate workers and staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1878.757s">As</a>  a result of this temporary parking situation, the mayor contacted Medford Housing Authority Director Jeffrey Driscoll to get a more complete breakdown of what vehicles are occupying spaces during the day, how long this disruption is anticipated and how a compromise can be reached to alleviate community concerns and allow accessibility to the worksite. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1897.464s">The</a>  mayor concluded that there were up to an additional 40 cars due to the lot construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1902.285s">Director</a>  Driscoll has been receptive and helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1904.386s">He</a>  reached out to the contractor for support <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1907.04s">Jim</a>  Silva, Special Project Coordinator, also visited the lot earlier last week and requested that the workers use the lower City Hall lot instead so that seniors had spots when visiting the Senior Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1917.272s">It</a>  is a work in progress to get the construction workers to relocate, but we are doing everything possible as parking for our seniors is our priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1923.939s">Thank</a>  you for your kind attention to this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1926.922s">And</a>  I'll recognize Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1930.144s">And</a>  thank you for Mrs. Tomaszczuk bringing forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1931.906s">I</a>  know I've talked to a few of our friends in the audience and I think there was some confusion first that people seem to thought it was about the pop-up park, but it's not about the pop-up park. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1943.435s">The</a>  issues and concerns are something that we'll hear again later on tonight is that the way we're doing business in Medford is that we're really not getting the community involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1955.325s">I</a>  know they wanna say the community gets involved, but the truth of the matter is <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1961.141s">Let</a>  me ask our seniors if we know that we have valuable land here. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1966.784s">And</a>  unfortunately, I think there has to be an understanding that we need some growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1972.326s">But</a>  if there was a partnership where we brought the process to the seniors and said, this is how we're going to look at the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1982.091s">We</a>  wanna make sure that all of your concerns are taken care of and get your input so you can share what you're afraid of. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1991.716s">and</a>  making sure that we fill those gaps. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1994.338s">I'm</a>  sure none of you have had that conversation with anybody from the city, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1997.721s">Correct</a>  me if I'm wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1999.202s">Okay,</a>  so this is what we're seeing right now in Medford, is that as we're going through our zoning changes, one thing we talked about was really going into the communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2009.069s">We</a>  put that in the RFP actually, about when we rezone, when we look at projects like this, we go into those communities, just like neighbor communities do when they do big projects like Assembly Row, <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2019.797s">and</a>  they do big projects like Union Square in Somerville, they actually bring city staff to the neighborhood where people come out and talk to you and you can share your concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2029.843s">So</a>  I'm hoping moving forward by coming to this podium, there is an issue, there is a concern, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2037.128s">I'm</a>  not gonna say that we don't need new growth and development. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2040.59s">I'm</a>  not gonna say that, I won't lie to you and tell you that I don't think that we need to use these parcels <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2046.204s">to</a>  make a change to really invest in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2049.467s">But</a>  at the same time, what we need is an understanding and a form of partnership where our seniors can say, okay, if you're going to take this lot, what lot are we going to build <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2064.375s">and</a>  to make sure that it's similar vicinity that our seniors can park and walk across the street or walk next door so we can accommodate all of the programs that you said are so important to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2076.246s">So</a>  I think moving forward, I think that we have a, you know, I hear you loud and clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2082.011s">I</a>  think that I'm going to advocate to make sure that as we move forward, especially with this RFP and these five parcels I heard that I think it's three, but <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2090.379s">I</a>  also told there was maybe five that are coming down the line that it's going to encompass the whole square. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2095.744s">So</a>  we're going to see drastic changes here. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2098.526s">And</a>  it seems like we're forgetting the most vulnerable people in our community, mostly our seniors, and saying, well, let's just move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2106.052s">So</a>  I'm welcoming. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2108.274s">I'll</a>  share my information, my phone number. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2110.556s">If</a>  you feel fear in any way, give me a call. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2113.738s">Let</a>  me at least try to be a voice as we go through this process, because unfortunately, it's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2119.631s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2119.951s">But</a>  I think that it could happen with a partnership. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2123.153s">So</a>  everybody's involved to make sure that all the concerns that you have are addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2129.036s">So</a>  you're not going to sleep thinking, are we going to lose the grieving program? <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2132.578s">We're</a>  going to lose the knitting program. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2134.059s">We're</a>  going to lose this program because there's nowhere to park. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2137.501s">So</a>  I think that's going to be important. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2138.902s">So</a>  I just want to share that with you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2141.003s">I</a>  think that from what I've talked to a few of the seniors offline, and I think after this conversation I shared with them, they felt a little bit better. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2151.388s">But</a>  I think that we really need a buy-in from the city administration to work with our seniors, not just bring you cookies and pizza on election week, but really sit down with you and say, hey, what do you really need? <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2162.774s">And</a>  making sure that your needs are met. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2164.255s">So</a>  thank you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2166.323s">Thank</a>  you Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2167.387s">Any</a>  further comments? <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2169.233s">Council</a>  Vice President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2172.11s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2172.87s">And</a>  I also want to appreciate the petitioner for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2175.771s">I</a>  think it's really important for us to use this forum for folks to have that additional opportunity to say, here are my concerns with the RFP in general, this zone in general, this project in general. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2190.095s">I</a>  think there's absolutely, you know, we thank you for, you know, again, voicing how important it is for, you know, everybody who needs access to the senior center and any, however they get there, whether it's by bus or by shuttle, by carpool, <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2201.758s">or</a>  by driving themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2203.819s">The</a>  senior center is so important to Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2206.361s">I'm</a>  heartened to see, you know, in the mayor's, in the memo from the planning department that that has been reiterated to some of the development, sorry, some of the developers who went on that site walk, that that's been said to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2217.949s">But</a>  I think it's important that we, you know, continue to reiterate this priority, which is a priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2222.592s">We</a>  have to make sure that people who need access to the senior center can continue to access it how they need to. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2229.197s">So</a>  we'll continue to help you emphasize that, and thank you for speaking to your concerns today.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2234.44s">Thank</a>  you, Vice President Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2235.4s">We'll</a>  go to Councilor Lazzaro.</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2238.122s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2238.863s">I</a>  also just wanted to reiterate that we appreciate the concerns, especially, I understand that every time I visited the Senior Center, it's an incredibly bustling place to visit. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2252.331s">All</a>  the activities are really well attended. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2256.233s">I</a>  know that mobility issues can be a big concern for folks who are there. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2260.519s">So</a>  I know that parking is very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2262.582s">And</a>  my hope would be that as the city reviews the proposals that parking is always and public parking parking that's available to be used. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2271.333s">would</a>  still be part of the buildings that they put there. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2274.757s">But</a>  Councilor Leming and I, we're members of the Resident Services Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2280.442s">And</a>  as part of that, we did a listening session at the Senior Center a few months ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2285.827s">It</a>  wasn't super well attended, but it was the only only the first one we did. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2288.79s">And</a>  we didn't have a chance to make it sort of a consistent thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2293.074s">But</a>  I would be excited to do that more often. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2295.737s">and</a>  have more opportunities for people to bring us what they're concerned about and tell us about the things like that, that are coming up more regularly that you're thinking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2304.659s">And</a>  maybe if we can make it something that perhaps rotating members of city council that can come to the senior center and hear concerns from people, we can look into that in resident services and talk more about it.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2316.202s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2319.193s">This</a>  is just a very brief comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2321.314s">So</a>  I do definitely hear what Marianne is saying about during any construction phase, it's likely that parking would be unavailable during that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2328.877s">But</a>  the RFP, just to really highlight this, the RFP does call for the construction of a parking garage in any developments that are created so long term. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2342.144s">ideally</a>  going by what the RFP says, this wouldn't affect parking availability in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2349.874s">So</a>  that's the idea, but I just wanted to, again, I'm hearing what Marianne is saying about the temporary unavailability during construction, but I did want to highlight that for folks in the room. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2358.404s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2359.915s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2360.335s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2360.655s">And</a>  just procedurally, um, the next steps as far as I understand it, the memo mentioned that responses will be due December 20th. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2369.618s">I</a>  believe then the planning department would come to this body to request our approval to authorize a land lease. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2375.68s">So</a>  there would be further public meetings regarding the proposal, and it would require a vote of the council to authorize the city to lease the land. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2383.917s">No,</a>  I'm just saying that that's the next steps for the RFP, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2388.759s">But</a>  we will go to comments and everyone will have three minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2392.181s">Give</a>  me one second as I figure out our new microphone system. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2399.724s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Warden]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2400.865s">My</a>  name is Cynthia Warden, 100 High Street, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2404.466s">There</a>  was a presentation at the senior center before the mayor's election, and we were told a lot about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2414.253s">There</a>  was definitely not enough parking spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2416.914s">Most</a>  of the seniors are physically handicapped, medically handicapped. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2420.756s">It's</a>  a lifeline for the people in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2423.558s">I'm</a>  getting all choked up. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2425.099s">I've</a>  had experiences with people whose spouses have died and they were able to come to the senior center and to save their lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2434.383s">It's</a>  like they're blatantly forgetting the seniors in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2441.987s">That's</a>  enough, that says it.</p>

    <p>[Creamer]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2451.243s">I'm</a>  Elizabeth Creamer, 60 Pleasant Street in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2454.986s">And</a>  not to repeat what other people have said. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2457.047s">I</a>  may have missed some of what you said, but I have concerns about the parking at the senior at the parking lot near the senior center. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2465.234s">I</a>  go there several times a week myself, and I often circle around many times and end up parking back on Riverside app down near the stores or back behind CBS. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2477.945s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2479.827s">When</a>  you think about the winter coming, it's not really acceptable that you would have to park that far away to go to the senior center. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2488.01s">I'm</a>  one of the lucky ones that are still able to drive. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2490.371s">I'm</a>  in my 80s, but not everybody can walk as easily as when they're younger. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2500.555s">So</a>  I'm concerned about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2503.636s">Despite</a>  what people say, there is a lack of parking there. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2507.597s">And</a>  as you heard before, <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2510.216s">From</a>  January until October, there was 8,787 cars that parked there to go to the senior center. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2520.445s">And</a>  many of these people take people with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2523.348s">It's</a>  a very vital center. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2527.952s">There's</a>  a lot for people's health and wellness and their well-being. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2532.136s">And</a>  I really hope that you will consider parking <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2535.56s">for</a>  the seniors and not to be thinking that we can just go far away and get parked and park somewhere and still be able to get to the center. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2546.37s">It's</a>  not going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2547.871s">I</a>  know what it's like in the wintertime when CVS was open. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2552.72s">know,</a>  the parking lot near the senior center is well plowed. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2556.623s">It's</a>  well taken care of. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2558.364s">But</a>  the streets around are not. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2560.646s">There's</a>  snow banks, there's ice, and it is really hazardous. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2566.27s">And</a>  just another little thought about the pop-up park. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2573.146s">I</a>  don't know where the common sense is of putting a pop-up park in a parking lot when parking is needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2580.409s">There's</a>  no green space there. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2582.01s">There's</a>  no trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2583.09s">There's</a>  no shade. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2586.211s">Just</a>  my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2588.112s">Thank</a>  you for listening to me.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2589.593s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2590.633s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Fennelly]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2600.322s">Good</a>  evening, Claudia Fennelly 36 Farragut Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2604.126s">I</a>  do thank you, Chairman Sachs for reviewing the proposal, because I had heard about the 99 year lease and I have to say at the outset that I was pretty. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2614.796s">It</a>  took me back to the days of Ozzie and Harriet because honestly, it's a very anti progressive. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2622.703s">proposal</a>  for 99 year lease because the city and the growth of the city that is anticipated and what it actually turns out to be in reality in the future are two separate things. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2635.926s">I</a>  don't think that the city benefits by that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2638.286s">I</a>  think it's a short term solution. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2642.567s">The</a>  comments today about the senior center as I do go to the senior center are all valid. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2649.028s">What</a>  I have observed in Medford Square is that the parking lots usage is event driven. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2656.618s">So</a>  if you have the Chevalier, Deep Cuts, the senior center, and they're all at different senior centers usually during the day, first thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2668.254s">the</a>  Chevalier is at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2670.015s">When</a>  those events happen, your lots are full. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2673.078s">You</a>  have off hours and that's probably what you observe as the not in use aspect of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2680.903s">However,</a>  I am very concerned about just tossing these parking lots out without getting the public's interest and input because Chevalier <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2695.334s">If</a>  you don't plan it right, it's a wonderful asset. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2698.776s">It</a>  makes Medford progressive. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2701.318s">But</a>  if they can't get people to park in the area, which parking is a challenge when you have a big popular event, then you're going to lose revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2710.623s">And</a>  it's a fine balance between looking at housing, business, retail, concert venues, music venues. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2720.99s">It's</a>  a juggling act. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2724.028s">You</a>  have to bring in revenue in order to make all these possibilities happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2728.911s">So</a>  my question I have for the council here is how are you allowing the <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2736.701s">Chevalier</a>  the method public library, the deep cuts, and the restaurants that are drawing in revenue and people, how are you allowing them to have an input a say in the proposal for the parking lots, because that is going to determine the outlook for the city and its growth aspect in years to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2757.704s">So</a>  as you've heard, the seniors mentioned that during their usage during the day, it's insufficient. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2764.327s">And</a>  if you take away that lot, the senior center will be impacted, which by the way, if you look at other senior centers in other cities, Medford is really very active and has a lot of activities. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2778.375s">And</a>  that brings in other people from other cities as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2782.337s">So</a>  I was just wondering how you plan to address <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2785.999s">businesses</a>  and include their input for the plan of these parking lots.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2792.383s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2792.843s">I</a>  can speak to the process that the planning department is working on. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2797.986s">I</a>  spoke with the planning director, Alicia Hunt, and she was at the Chamber of Commerce. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2804.01s">I</a>  think last week they had a day where all the businesses in the square could meet with her and kind of have conversations about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2811.294s">That</a>  includes the current chair is the Chevalier manager, Andrew Mather, and <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2819.539s">So</a>  that was something that happened, and I know that she relayed to me that there was a lot of excitement, but they did want to be engaged specifically around this question of parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2827.602s">And</a>  one of the things that they were looking at, and I don't know if it's going to happen as part of this project, and it really depends on the proposals that come in from the people who are proposing, was seeing if the parking garage that is attached to Atrius Health could be redeveloped to be a more public parking garage. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2847.548s">so</a>  that during the day it could be used by the health folks and at night potentially be used for other uses, because right now it's closed at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2856.712s">But</a>  I don't think that would be the only answer, but that was just an idea that I had heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2861.895s">In</a>  any case, there was a meeting with the Chamber of Commerce specifically about these RFPs with the businesses in the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2868.898s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2874.909s">Does</a>  anyone else want to speak on the topic Councilor Tseng, Thank you.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2883.479s">Just</a>  wanted to thank our seniors for taking time out of their evenings to come here. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2886.701s">I</a>  know it's not the easiest and raising more attention about this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2891.444s">It</a>  is an issue I've, I heard at the senior center last time I visited. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2896.508s">It's</a>  an issue that I know the planning department has spoken to me a little bit about in our meetings about development in Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2904.133s">But</a>  I think it's really important to reiterate that <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2907.515s">The,</a>  this is just the very beginning of the RFP process that will have to look at the projects that are proposed that come in, there'll be public, there'll be public meetings about it I think at that time we'll have to make sure that we extend an invite to the members of the senior center as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2923.219s">to</a>  make sure that, you know, what I'm hearing is that there's a need for parking, but it's not just the need for parking, it's a need for a transition plan while we do the development, the growth that we need to do in Medford Square as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2935.429s">And</a>  so leveraging things like the Atrius Hall parking lot, leveraging spaces that aren't open right now, I think will become an important part of that transition plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2945.237s">And</a>  I think part of that needed conversation with our planning department, and I know the planning department's already <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2951.761s">talking</a>  about a lot of these issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2954.443s">There</a>  can always be more community engagement. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2957.385s">There's</a>  always a need to balance our growing square, our growing revenue sources in the square with the lived reality on the ground as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2966.472s">So</a>  I wanted to, again, thank you guys for coming in today. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2970.815s">And</a>  I know there are folks from the planning department watching this meeting, and I hope that that becomes part of the conversation too.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3019.429s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Beckwith]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3019.829s">But</a>  I pick up people all over to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3023.151s">So</a>  what I'm trying to say is, I think when it comes to revenue and money, the seniors are going to be tossed out and I feel it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3033.356s">And</a>  I'd like you to like, tell me that isn't true. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3035.937s">But</a>  I think it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3038.444s">Because</a>  if you say the atrius, that's for people that are getting medical help and it's full. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3049.228s">It's</a>  a nice idea, but it's not real. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3052.57s">We</a>  need definite parking or we can't go to the senior center. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3057.532s">Just</a>  like in West Medford, we need a path. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3061.453s">It's</a>  taking eight years to get that path. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3066.085s">You</a>  really need to consider seniors in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3068.867s">Now,</a>  I know that the youth, you're important, the schools are important, but the seniors have built this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3077.293s">We've</a>  grown up here and we've given ourselves to the city of Medford, and I think you need to consider us. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3082.437s">And</a>  that's why I brought up the grief group, because some of us are alive because of those grief groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3090.302s">So</a>  think on that, you're young, you don't have to deal with this yet, but you will, it's coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3096.334s">ability,</a>  vision, all these things are coming, believe me, and I'm still young at heart.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3104.148s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3104.549s">Go</a>  to Councilor Callahan, then we'll go back to the microphone for public participation.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3112.782s">I</a>  just wanted to note that I was actually kind of peeking through the RFP. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3118.946s">Just</a>  now, definitely it specifically calls out the parking of the senior center that that must be that that must be like. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3130.314s">I</a>  think replaced or continued at least the number of parking spaces, but it also talks about the idea that the parking that is created has to not only consider the senior center, but it also has to account for new business development in the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3148.67s">So</a>  I'm not saying that what's in the RFP, sorry, I'll talk to the, I'm supposed to talk to the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3153.814s">I'm</a>  not saying that what's in the RFP is definitely what <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3158.118s">will</a>  happen in the end product. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3159.899s">But</a>  I think that it just so that you know, it is in the RFP specifically that those requests are there. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3167.244s">And</a>  then this you coming to this meeting is absolutely fantastic, because, you know, it has to come through this body. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3174.129s">So</a>  we are now extra aware. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3176.81s">I</a>  also would love to be in one of the future <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3181.053s">listening</a>  sessions at the senior center. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3184.094s">And</a>  we can even specifically bring up this topic of the RFP. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3188.956s">And,</a>  you know, as we go forward, I think there will be other public meetings about the development that is going to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3196.82s">So</a>  I really appreciate all of your comments, and we will take them to heart and we will, you know, make sure to <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3202.862s">be</a>  pushing forward as the RFP moves forward through the process, that we will make sure that not only are there enough spaces for the senior center, but also for the growing needs of parking in Medford Square as it grows.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3221.474s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3221.834s">I</a>  just just a point of information maybe some clarity for the planning department. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3226.137s">I</a>  know that the question that was reported back to me that part of the RP that the mentioned the mayor mentioned was that it was a looking at 40 spots. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3236.881s">for</a>  the new developers. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3237.841s">So</a>  that doesn't even come close. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3239.423s">So</a>  I think this is why having this conversation is a beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3243.506s">And</a>  I think it's before it gets too late because we're down the line with other projects in the city that our community hasn't been involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3252.514s">And</a>  when I say community, it's having those meetings at the senior center. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3258.243s">when</a>  you set a vision of what you want this to look like, what you want Medford Square to look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3262.504s">So</a>  this is where you bring in the business community, because some business members that were at that chamber meeting, really, they weren't very excited. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3269.266s">So</a>  there's some question. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3270.606s">But</a>  that's why you have these meetings open to everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3273.547s">And</a>  you sit there with all the department heads, your planning department, your recreation department, your fire department, your police department, because there's so many things that <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3282.284s">when</a>  you look at development that have to be considered, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3286.455s">Do</a>  we, if we build this many <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3288.977s">we</a>  bring in this many people, are we going to have the infrastructure DPW can carry? <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3293.62s">If</a>  we build it, bring in this many people, are we going to have enough police? <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3296.923s">Are</a>  we going to have fire? <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3298.344s">So</a>  there's so many, so many, and I only speak on this on as, as, as person who does this as a department head in the past, I worked for municipality. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3307.59s">And</a>  what we do is before, before the city came out and just started giving out RFPs and getting the idea of the developers, because that's the problem with Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3317.017s">we</a>  bring the developers in to get their idea first. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3319.738s">Isn't</a>  that, that's a shame. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3321.138s">So</a>  the issue is in other communities what happens is you bring your stakeholders in first with the plans that were were derived that Medford has spent millions of dollars on that dust some of those off and say well these plans say this. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3335.443s">So</a>  where do you feel and what do you fit? <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3337.144s">So</a>  the first thing we see is our senior citizens have already come out and said what? <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3340.76s">We're</a>  scared that we're going to be overlooked and bypassed because one of the basic necessities we have is parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3348.263s">So</a>  that could be something that you look at at a meeting like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3352.044s">So</a>  I'm hoping that the mayor really, really readjust and understand the process when it comes to the December proposals that come in, that we reassess again and look at the true process of true development and true input from our community, where we bring the meeting to you <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3370.583s">Not</a>  somewhere that you have to find one, you have to find where this meeting is and then go out and look for it and then not have the proper people in that can answer the questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3378.606s">But</a>  neighboring communities, what they do is they bring everybody in. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3381.947s">So</a>  every question is answered right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3384.468s">So</a>  then we could set up a comprehensive plan that involves all the stakeholders. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3390.149s">Now,</a>  that means that not everybody's gonna be happy with some of the decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3395.396s">but</a>  at least they can look at outcomes. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3397.157s">I</a>  know one of the things we talked about in my neighboring community was it was affecting the process for one of our senior areas in Union Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3405.219s">So</a>  part of the deal was that we would have a shuttle system in place that would be built in with the developers that we don't need senior citizens who didn't need the parking in that area for it was identified for a small group, I think it was 50 people. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3420.419s">So</a>  they looked at how they would shuttle the seniors in, and that was part of the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3426.121s">So</a>  that's being creative. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3428.081s">And</a>  again, that's at least giving you an option to give you calm and understand that people are looking out for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3435.004s">Because</a>  a friend that came up to the podium said that our seniors are afraid that we're being forgotten. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3441.846s">Yeah,</a>  I hear you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3443.777s">I've</a>  heard that in the last, especially three months in the process, we're seeing what's happening on election day. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3449.162s">We</a>  hear you, at least I hear you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3451.844s">So</a>  I think we need to really put our money where our mouth is and really start opening up the dialogue with the most vulnerable members of our community, unfortunately, which are our seniors. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3460.632s">So</a>  thank you, Councilor Bearsley.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3462.992s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3463.392s">I</a>  do want to just make a point. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3465.094s">I</a>  don't disagree with what you said and engaging people is really important, but I just want to be clear that going to the RFP was not the first thing as part of this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3474.743s">This</a>  process references the 2017 Medford Square plan under Mayor Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3479.988s">There</a>  was a 2019 evaluation of development potential under Mayor Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3483.671s">the</a>  2022 housing plan and the 2022 draft comprehensive plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3487.232s">And</a>  there were multiple community meetings last year before the drafting of this RFP, including two at the senior center. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3494.214s">So,</a>  you know, that work has happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3496.475s">Maybe</a>  not everyone went to every meeting, but when we talk about what happened, I just think that should be noted. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3503.397s">There</a>  was two public meetings at the senior center talking about this project and the transforming the square initiative.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3512.921s">I</a>  think the concern with that response was that not everybody is getting informed. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3519.725s">That's</a>  what I'm hearing from everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3521.506s">You</a>  might just check a box and say, we're having a meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3524.267s">Now,</a>  I understand the comprehensive plans that have been going on for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3526.729s">We</a>  spend millions of dollars on it, Council President. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3528.97s">But</a>  what we're seeing, what I'm hearing, especially firsthand from our seniors, is <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3533.385s">people</a>  are getting surveyed that then they say there's a survey of people say they've been spoken to people said there were meetings, but no one really knows when it seems like just a certain group understands against this message, because the average person, and you can look at what we have here in the auditorium today. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3549.298s">they're</a>  not getting the message. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3550.359s">So</a>  if that's the case, Council President, we need to do a better job as a community and a leadership in the city is to educate all of our members of our community so they can get involved with these processes. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3562.788s">So</a>  again, thank you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3564.569s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3565.07s">And</a>  I certainly don't disagree with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3567.151s">I</a>  do know that the office worked with the senior center to get the word out. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3571.522s">And</a>  I am hopeful, again, we heard from Dan Kennedy recently online about a city newspaper. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3577.027s">We</a>  need that level of information and resource, but there have been meetings and we do do as much outreach as we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3585.414s">And</a>  that doesn't always reach everyone, even when we try to reach everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3588.437s">We'll</a>  go to Councilor Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3592.335s">Something</a>  I did forget to mention and I think is in the vein of in a similar vein is that something the city, the planning department and different departments in the city is working hard on right now and I sat in on a bunch of these meetings is, is the transportation task force, which specifically is. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3612.418s">looks</a>  at transportation needs across the city, but especially for seniors, that's the main crux of the work that the task force is doing right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3620.844s">Of</a>  course, a lot of it's understanding where people are coming from, getting to, how people are getting to the senior center, how can we make that more efficient, how we can make that suit the needs of what seniors are doing right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3636.694s">And</a>  a lot of these questions, I think, are part of the conversations that that task force is having. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3642.957s">There's</a>  a survey out that the city's working hard with the senior center to push out. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3647.418s">And</a>  I know because there are seniors here and seniors watching online, I just wanted to bring attention, bring awareness to that survey that's out there right now and to the work that the city's doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3659.983s">And</a>  so this is a good time for seniors to be, <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3663.784s">coming</a>  to City Council meetings, letting us and different department staff know about those transportation needs.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3672.987s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3673.667s">I'll</a>  go to the podium, name and address for the record, and you'll have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Vartabedian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3679.368s">Paulette</a>  Vartabedian, Central Lab Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3682.269s">I</a>  apologize if this was addressed prior to my coming here because I was a bit late, but has anything been discussed as far as <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3693.251s">where</a>  the senior parking is and or behind Colleen's at that parking lot to make it a parking garage where the parking goes up.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3705.901s">In</a>  terms of the Colleen's behind there, that's not part of the scope of the request for proposal.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Vartabedian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3711.246s">No,</a>  I understand, but as we're talking about developing Medford Square and how there's problems with parking, if Chevalier has an issue or not an issue, <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3721.761s">an</a>  event or some of the other places. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3725.142s">We</a>  have a lot of new, very popular restaurants in Medford Square and parking is an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3731.765s">So</a>  the senior center parking, if that becomes a parking garage, that's great, but it's at one end of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3741.829s">If</a>  there was something that was more centrally located in addition as a parking garage, <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3748.291s">where</a>  there's just one level of parking now behind Colleen's just think that that's something that needs to be looked at, if it hasn't already. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3755.515s">That's</a>  all.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3756.215s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Vartabedian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3756.616s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3763.459s">Name</a>  and address the record, you have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3767.441s">Thank</a>  you, Council President Andrew Castagnetti, I live two blocks east of the Senior Citizen Center in East Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3778.396s">I've</a>  been a member for some years of the Senior Citizen Center, and parking can be a problem at times, especially if they have one of those potty type things. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3790.181s">And</a>  I'm not against development because without future development, we will shrink economically. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3804.517s">However,</a>  I can understand their concern because they're having a hard time getting around. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3809.139s">And</a>  so am I at times. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3810.2s">And</a>  it's hard to walk, you know, a couple of hundred yards from Brigham's or Colleen's as you call it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3817.884s">So</a>  more importantly, I believe it was Councilor Lemmy had mentioned that for sure, or maybe, maybe through the chair and over the rail, he could, <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3833.322s">Go</a>  over this for me to be a parking garage. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3836.864s">And</a>  how many units would that be for parking spaces? <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3840.406s">How</a>  tall of a garage? <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3842.267s">Is</a>  there an elevator? <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3844.328s">Things</a>  of that nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3845.669s">And</a>  designated for the senior citizens, how many spots? <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3848.99s">If</a>  you have the answers.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3850.669s">Yeah,</a>  so we don't have the proposals yet, but the request for proposals document says that parking is a priority and that the senior center parking needs to be replaced in full no matter what develops. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3862.474s">But</a>  the specific proposals such as height, et cetera, hasn't come out yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3866.276s">And</a>  that won't be out until after December 20th, which is the deadline for the proposals.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3872.439s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3874.207s">Again,</a>  I'm not against development because that's important. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3877.33s">Mystic</a>  Ave should have been done when they moved there in 1955. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3879.951s">This</a>  is the same, five years later, they built Route 93. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3885.255s">So</a>  the old highway to Boston is where the development should actually go. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3889.178s">Mystic</a>  Ave, the old highway, Route 38. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3892.6s">And</a>  if I remember correctly, the original builder of the hotel, the original builder, <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3901.179s">It</a>  didn't work out, he failed because of political reasons, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3905.841s">He</a>  was going to build a hotel there where it is now, and he was going to make some grand or type of entrance way to the river, which is something we never should have turned our backs on. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3917.665s">In</a>  Georgetown, Virginia, they built it on the river with their decks and their entertainment. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3923.828s">We</a>  turned our back to the river. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3925.809s">That</a>  was a big mistake. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3927.546s">So,</a>  so I want to say, and I wanted to talk during public participation about something. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3933.714s">Would</a>  that be now it's a different subject are you going to hold it open for me later on, sir, I'm going to finish out this subject and then we will take you after that.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3942.484s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3944.387s">Any</a>  further discussion on this subject Councilor Callahan.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3948.987s">I</a>  had a thought as we were discussing this because I and I do remember going to some of those public participation community events organized by the planning department to discuss these three lots. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3963.391s">And</a>  I, I wonder if there is something of a timing problem because you know that was <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3970.473s">At</a>  least it was a year and a half ago, or over a year ago for sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3974.335s">And</a>  I think what may happen is that when it's so far away from a reality. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3982.599s">People</a>  might not realize that it's going to impact them. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3989.163s">And</a>  then when it becomes like now there's an actual RFP and it's already been sent out. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3994.488s">And</a>  so now people are worried. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3996.85s">So</a>  I'm wondering if maybe, you know, we can have like just a chit chat with the administration and talk about maybe having, spreading the community meetings in such a way that there are some community meetings closer to <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4014.425s">or</a>  like before or after an RFP goes out, because now that it's becoming a reality I think people are realizing the way that it's going to impact their lives in a way that a year and a half ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4025.137s">It</a>  wasn't, it didn't seem like something to attend so anyway, I'm just thinking about that as something that maybe <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4033.826s">You</a>  know, if the administration is in fact, you know, we are having these community meetings, but the timing isn't lining up with what people need in terms of it being really applicable to their lives and then wanting to take the time out to come to these community meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4048.861s">So</a>  I think I may just have a little, and I might talk to some folks in the administration about that possibility of changing the timing of some of those.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4056.088s">Yeah,</a>  I would just note. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4058.681s">that</a>  we did receive that they were well attended. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4061.502s">We</a>  could probably get more information about that to share with folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4065.664s">And</a>  I believe there are recordings available online as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4069.006s">But</a>  it does tend to be as part of the planning process that you spend a the time to do the comprehensive plan, then you spend the time to do the community outreach, and then you put together the proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4077.71s">And</a>  then again, right, like, that's not the end of the public process. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4081.391s">So</a>  it's a multi year multi stage planning process. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4083.892s">But</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4085.973s">We're</a>  having a conversation right now, and people can come to any council meeting and talk about it, but we also will have further public meetings and public hearings as the process goes forward.</p>

    <p>[Beckwith]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4101.06s">Yes,</a>  Lorna Jane Beckwith, and I live at 9 Walkland Court, apartment F. I was at both of those meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4108.024s">I</a>  remember Alicia Hunt. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4109.704s">I</a>  remember who came representing the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4114.201s">we</a>  were still very clear as seniors of what we needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4119.65s">And</a>  that's why we've been keeping track of how many of us park there, why we know there's 8,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4127.731s">because</a>  we're very clear of what we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4130.972s">Not</a>  that it was far away, we were saying, no, we want to stay as a senior center. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4136.595s">So</a>  I hate to disagree with you on this, but we were clear about parking then, and we're clear about it now. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4143.617s">We've</a>  got to have some parking or it will close for us.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4150.94s">Any</a>  further discussion on this item? <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4157.472s">Seeing</a>  none, we'll move to general public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4159.553s">Public</a>  participation on any topic not on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4165.495s">Yep.</a> </p>
