00:18:13,091 --> 00:18:26,257
[SPEAKER_08]: And whereas Mr. Bohannon was deeply thankful to have the wallet returned, both because it was designed by his late brother and because the cards and information would have taken months to replace, describing the act, quote, as quote, as close to a miracle as we have experienced and,

9
00:18:26,857 --> 00:18:36,926
[SPEAKER_08]: Whereas Mr. Bohannon and his wife wanted to express their gratitude and, quote, do something for these really thoughtful employees while noting that, quote, they wouldn't take anything and including his letter with the words, quote, we love Medford.

16
00:19:17,984 --> 00:19:27,927

31
00:20:07,068 --> 00:20:14,369
[SPEAKER_08]: reports of committees 24475 offered by council President bears committee of the whole October 15 2024.

32
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:25,452
[SPEAKER_08]: This was the question and answer session that we held October 15 regarding the proposed override and debt exclusion ballot questions that are on the ballot on November 5.

33
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:31,413
[SPEAKER_08]: And just a point of note, as regards to the voting Councilor Scarpelli raised to me the point of

34
00:20:32,566 --> 00:20:37,508
[SPEAKER_08]: the letting people know if you're coming in, we're seeing a lot of early voting, a lot of mail voting.

35
00:20:37,528 --> 00:20:47,772
[SPEAKER_08]: And just a reminder to everyone, when you early vote or you mail vote, your ballot is put into a sealed envelope and that envelope is opened on election day and counted on election day.

36
00:20:47,892 --> 00:20:54,595
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you're expecting it to run through the machine on the early voter, the mail vote, that's not how the state law around elections work.

37
00:20:55,570 --> 00:21:05,160
[SPEAKER_08]: So those envelopes will be opened by the elections department staff on election day and then will be run through the machines on election day, along with all the ballots of everyone who votes on election day.

38
00:21:06,542 --> 00:21:07,463
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Scarpelli.

39
00:21:09,825 --> 00:21:14,530
[SPEAKER_11]: I've talked to the election commissioners and they said that these rules are all posted

40
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:17,773
[SPEAKER_11]: at City Hall and the election in the elections office.

41
00:21:17,793 --> 00:21:23,561
[SPEAKER_11]: So if anybody does need some clarity that the election office does have all this information.

42
00:21:23,581 --> 00:21:24,523
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you, Mr. President.

[SPEAKER_08]: Let me give you one second to turn on your microphone.

89
00:24:59,934 --> 00:25:01,374
[SPEAKER_20]: Hello, I'm Marian Tomaszczuk.

90
00:25:01,414 --> 00:25:12,960
[SPEAKER_20]: I live at 29 Garfield Avenue, and I'm here to talk about the parking lot that is on the RFP plan that's adjacent to the Medford Senior Center.

[SPEAKER_20]: I am here to talk to you and ask you if there's any way you can reconsider having this parking lot

[SPEAKER_20]: be up for development.

93
00:25:25,993 --> 00:25:28,495
[SPEAKER_20]: It is a well-used parking lot.

94
00:25:28,695 --> 00:25:35,359
[SPEAKER_20]: It is necessary for the senior center to survive and also the businesses that are abutting it.

95
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,841
[SPEAKER_20]: The senior center uses it on a daily basis.

96
00:25:38,961 --> 00:25:43,304
[SPEAKER_20]: The senior center is valuable.

97
00:25:43,804 --> 00:25:52,690
[SPEAKER_20]: It is used not only for the seniors, it is used for their families, resources, for counseling, for activities,

98
00:25:53,390 --> 00:26:00,616
[SPEAKER_20]: for learning, for education, for the families, for the seniors, and it also feeds them.

99
00:26:02,697 --> 00:26:08,682
[SPEAKER_20]: The parking is very necessary.

100
00:26:08,742 --> 00:26:16,128
[SPEAKER_20]: We do carpool as much as we can, but since this year, from January till October 15th, 8,787 cars have been parked there by,

101
00:26:22,398 --> 00:26:25,999
[SPEAKER_20]: seniors, and those are not duplicate people.

102
00:26:26,359 --> 00:26:29,320
[SPEAKER_20]: Those are just individuals that have been parking there.

103
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,941
[SPEAKER_20]: On an average day, we have 51 people parking there.

104
00:26:37,041 --> 00:26:44,703
[SPEAKER_20]: On Monday, in August, it's exceptionally busy because of the air conditioning, and it's a cooling location.

105
00:26:45,283 --> 00:26:47,384
[SPEAKER_20]: So in August this year, on Monday, we had 193 people.

106
00:26:47,404 --> 00:26:47,664
[SPEAKER_20]: On Tuesdays, 293.

107
00:26:47,704 --> 00:26:47,784
[SPEAKER_20]: On 291,

108
00:26:52,295 --> 00:26:56,638
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm sorry, Wednesday, 184, Thursday, 206, on Friday, 116.

109
00:26:58,299 --> 00:27:02,522
[SPEAKER_20]: So average monthlies are also high.

110
00:27:02,882 --> 00:27:04,443
[SPEAKER_20]: In October, it's average is 200.

111
00:27:06,004 --> 00:27:07,565
[SPEAKER_20]: August's average is over 200.

112
00:27:08,386 --> 00:27:10,427
[SPEAKER_20]: So this is something we need.

113
00:27:10,888 --> 00:27:16,111
[SPEAKER_20]: If we don't have that parking spot, parking lot, the senior center will die.

114
00:27:16,812 --> 00:27:21,695
[SPEAKER_20]: Even if you start developing it, it'll be a good three years, there will be no parking.

115
00:27:23,337 --> 00:27:24,518
[SPEAKER_20]: nobody will be able to come.

116
00:27:25,238 --> 00:27:53,037
[SPEAKER_20]: The seniors will have no place to socialize, they'll have no place to go and have their meals, they'll have no place to go and have activities, there'll be no counseling, there'll be no low vision, there'll be no crochet, no knitting, no activities, no exercise programs, there'll be no healthcare programs, there'll be nothing for the seniors and we really need it.

117
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:58,451
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, grief support is very is very vital.

118
00:27:58,711 --> 00:28:01,860
[SPEAKER_20]: We have the grief support groups, it helped me when my husband passed.

119
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:04,458
[SPEAKER_20]: to get over it.

120
00:28:05,178 --> 00:28:07,039
[SPEAKER_20]: We have LGBT groups there.

121
00:28:07,299 --> 00:28:09,380
[SPEAKER_20]: We have everything you can imagine.

122
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:13,822
[SPEAKER_20]: And like I say, it's not just for the seniors, it's for their families.

123
00:28:14,602 --> 00:28:19,024
[SPEAKER_20]: They need support to find out what they can do when their parents are failing.

124
00:28:19,525 --> 00:28:20,865
[SPEAKER_20]: It's for the low vision groups.

125
00:28:21,005 --> 00:28:22,166
[SPEAKER_20]: It's for the Alzheimer's.

126
00:28:22,666 --> 00:28:23,947
[SPEAKER_20]: It's for the disabled.

127
00:28:25,247 --> 00:28:30,309
[SPEAKER_20]: It's for a very high percent of the Medford population.

128
00:28:32,338 --> 00:28:38,540
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm humbling asking you if you can intervene and have us save this valuable parking lot.

129
00:28:39,061 --> 00:28:39,421
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

130
00:28:40,041 --> 00:28:42,742

139
00:29:06,572 --> 00:29:24,323
[SPEAKER_08]: I have here to Council President Bears and honorable members of the council regarding the public participation petition respectfully submitted for your honorable body's consideration as additional information about activities concerning the municipally owned parking lot at 75 Riverside Avenue.

140
00:29:25,144 --> 00:29:30,147
[SPEAKER_08]: Clippership pop-up as of October 9th, the corner of the parking lot has been repurposed to create

141
00:29:33,453 --> 00:29:46,387
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, sorry, repurpose to create the clipper ship pop up park, the pop up is utilized by the city, particularly the recreation department for periodic programming and is otherwise open for passive recreation to the public.

142
00:29:46,946 --> 00:29:49,429
[SPEAKER_08]: To create the pop-up park, no parking spaces were lost.

143
00:29:49,489 --> 00:29:54,994
[SPEAKER_08]: The pop-up area was created from what was a previously redundant drive aisle and six parking spots.

144
00:29:55,715 --> 00:30:03,302
[SPEAKER_08]: To prevent any loss of parking, eight new parking spots were re-striped in the parking lot, resulting in a net positive for parking spaces overall.

145
00:30:03,903 --> 00:30:07,427
[SPEAKER_08]: Please see photos below demonstrating locations of eight new parking spaces.

146
00:30:10,123 --> 00:30:19,790
[SPEAKER_08]: Request for proposals Medford Square, the city published an RFP request for proposal for three underutilized parcels behind City Hall on September 30th, 2024.

147
00:30:20,511 --> 00:30:30,538
[SPEAKER_08]: The city wants to garner interest from developers to explore what redevelopment options there would be for these three combined parcels, including mixed use buildings, affordable housing and parking structures.

148
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:36,703
[SPEAKER_08]: The city will enter a long-term ground lease for up to 99 years with a qualified developer for these parcels.

149
00:30:37,383 --> 00:30:41,465
[SPEAKER_08]: The due date for responses is December 20th, 2024 at 1 p.m.

150
00:30:42,026 --> 00:30:51,191
[SPEAKER_08]: Community outreach for this project was conducted through focus groups and community meetings through the Transforming the Square project in partnership with Metropolitan Area Planning Council in 2023.

151
00:30:52,071 --> 00:30:55,753
[SPEAKER_08]: MAPC conducted research using previous plans and site visits of the square.

152
00:30:55,933 --> 00:30:58,975
[SPEAKER_08]: Please note that parking for our seniors is a top priority for the city.

153
00:30:59,675 --> 00:31:03,838
[SPEAKER_08]: The mayor explicitly mentioned this in her greeting to developers before the walkthrough last week.

154
00:31:06,451 --> 00:31:07,913
[SPEAKER_08]: Construction employee parking.

155
00:31:08,174 --> 00:31:18,029
[SPEAKER_08]: Due to the large-scale construction project at 121 Riverside Avenue, the adjacent Clippership lot has seen an influx of commercial and personal vehicle parking to accommodate workers and staff.

156
00:31:18,757 --> 00:31:36,703
[SPEAKER_08]: As a result of this temporary parking situation, the mayor contacted Medford Housing Authority Director Jeffrey Driscoll to get a more complete breakdown of what vehicles are occupying spaces during the day, how long this disruption is anticipated and how a compromise can be reached to alleviate community concerns and allow accessibility to the worksite.

157
00:31:37,464 --> 00:31:41,505
[SPEAKER_08]: The mayor concluded that there were up to an additional 40 cars due to the lot construction.

158
00:31:42,285 --> 00:31:44,266
[SPEAKER_08]: Director Driscoll has been receptive and helpful.

159
00:31:44,386 --> 00:31:46,307
[SPEAKER_08]: He reached out to the contractor for support

160
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:56,611
[SPEAKER_08]: Jim Silva, Special Project Coordinator, also visited the lot earlier last week and requested that the workers use the lower City Hall lot instead so that seniors had spots when visiting the Senior Center.

161
00:31:57,272 --> 00:32:03,699
[SPEAKER_08]: It is a work in progress to get the construction workers to relocate, but we are doing everything possible as parking for our seniors is our priority.

162
00:32:03,939 --> 00:32:05,801
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for your kind attention to this matter.

163
00:32:06,922 --> 00:32:08,264
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'll recognize Councilor Scarpelli.

164
00:32:10,144 --> 00:32:11,886
[SPEAKER_11]: And thank you for Mrs. Tomaszczuk bringing forward.

165
00:32:11,906 --> 00:32:22,775
[SPEAKER_11]: I know I've talked to a few of our friends in the audience and I think there was some confusion first that people seem to thought it was about the pop-up park, but it's not about the pop-up park.

166
00:32:23,435 --> 00:32:35,285
[SPEAKER_11]: The issues and concerns are something that we'll hear again later on tonight is that the way we're doing business in Medford is that we're really not getting the community involved.

167
00:32:35,325 --> 00:32:39,128
[SPEAKER_11]: I know they wanna say the community gets involved, but the truth of the matter is

168
00:32:41,141 --> 00:32:46,303
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me ask our seniors if we know that we have valuable land here.

169
00:32:46,784 --> 00:32:51,346
[SPEAKER_11]: And unfortunately, I think there has to be an understanding that we need some growth.

170
00:32:52,326 --> 00:33:01,671
[SPEAKER_11]: But if there was a partnership where we brought the process to the seniors and said, this is how we're going to look at the project.

171
00:33:02,091 --> 00:33:10,775
[SPEAKER_11]: We wanna make sure that all of your concerns are taken care of and get your input so you can share what you're afraid of.

172
00:33:11,716 --> 00:33:13,658
[SPEAKER_11]: and making sure that we fill those gaps.

173
00:33:14,338 --> 00:33:17,220
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure none of you have had that conversation with anybody from the city, correct?

174
00:33:17,721 --> 00:33:18,441
[SPEAKER_11]: Correct me if I'm wrong.

175
00:33:19,202 --> 00:33:29,009
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so this is what we're seeing right now in Medford, is that as we're going through our zoning changes, one thing we talked about was really going into the communities.

176
00:33:29,069 --> 00:33:39,077
[SPEAKER_11]: We put that in the RFP actually, about when we rezone, when we look at projects like this, we go into those communities, just like neighbor communities do when they do big projects like Assembly Row,

177
00:33:39,797 --> 00:33:49,423
[SPEAKER_11]: and they do big projects like Union Square in Somerville, they actually bring city staff to the neighborhood where people come out and talk to you and you can share your concerns.

178
00:33:49,843 --> 00:33:57,008
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm hoping moving forward by coming to this podium, there is an issue, there is a concern, right?

179
00:33:57,128 --> 00:34:00,570
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not gonna say that we don't need new growth and development.

180
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:05,533
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not gonna say that, I won't lie to you and tell you that I don't think that we need to use these parcels

181
00:34:06,204 --> 00:34:09,447
[SPEAKER_11]: to make a change to really invest in Medford.

182
00:34:09,467 --> 00:34:23,540
[SPEAKER_11]: But at the same time, what we need is an understanding and a form of partnership where our seniors can say, okay, if you're going to take this lot, what lot are we going to build

183
00:34:24,375 --> 00:34:36,186
[SPEAKER_11]: and to make sure that it's similar vicinity that our seniors can park and walk across the street or walk next door so we can accommodate all of the programs that you said are so important to you.

184
00:34:36,246 --> 00:34:41,931
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think moving forward, I think that we have a, you know, I hear you loud and clear.

185
00:34:42,011 --> 00:34:49,879
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that I'm going to advocate to make sure that as we move forward, especially with this RFP and these five parcels I heard that I think it's three, but

186
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:55,724
[SPEAKER_11]: I also told there was maybe five that are coming down the line that it's going to encompass the whole square.

187
00:34:55,744 --> 00:34:57,765
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're going to see drastic changes here.

188
00:34:58,526 --> 00:35:05,972
[SPEAKER_11]: And it seems like we're forgetting the most vulnerable people in our community, mostly our seniors, and saying, well, let's just move forward.

189
00:35:06,052 --> 00:35:07,573
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm welcoming.

190
00:35:08,274 --> 00:35:10,175
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll share my information, my phone number.

191
00:35:10,556 --> 00:35:13,178
[SPEAKER_11]: If you feel fear in any way, give me a call.

192
00:35:13,738 --> 00:35:18,843
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me at least try to be a voice as we go through this process, because unfortunately, it's happening.

193
00:35:19,631 --> 00:35:19,911
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

194
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:23,113
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think that it could happen with a partnership.

195
00:35:23,153 --> 00:35:28,556
[SPEAKER_11]: So everybody's involved to make sure that all the concerns that you have are addressed.

196
00:35:29,036 --> 00:35:32,558
[SPEAKER_11]: So you're not going to sleep thinking, are we going to lose the grieving program?

197
00:35:32,578 --> 00:35:34,039
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to lose the knitting program.

198
00:35:34,059 --> 00:35:36,740
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to lose this program because there's nowhere to park.

199
00:35:37,501 --> 00:35:38,882
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think that's going to be important.

200
00:35:38,902 --> 00:35:40,983
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just want to share that with you, Mr. President.

201
00:35:41,003 --> 00:35:50,528
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that from what I've talked to a few of the seniors offline, and I think after this conversation I shared with them, they felt a little bit better.

202
00:35:51,388 --> 00:36:02,434
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think that we really need a buy-in from the city administration to work with our seniors, not just bring you cookies and pizza on election week, but really sit down with you and say, hey, what do you really need?

203
00:36:02,774 --> 00:36:04,195
[SPEAKER_11]: And making sure that your needs are met.

204
00:36:04,255 --> 00:36:05,536
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you, Mr. President.

205
00:36:06,323 --> 00:36:07,367
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you Councilor Scarpelli.

206
00:36:07,387 --> 00:36:09,113
[SPEAKER_08]: Any further comments?

207
00:36:09,233 --> 00:36:10,418
[SPEAKER_08]: Council Vice President Collins.

208
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:12,850
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, President Bears.

209
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:15,731
[SPEAKER_25]: And I also want to appreciate the petitioner for bringing this forward.

210
00:36:15,771 --> 00:36:29,155
[SPEAKER_25]: I think it's really important for us to use this forum for folks to have that additional opportunity to say, here are my concerns with the RFP in general, this zone in general, this project in general.

211
00:36:30,095 --> 00:36:41,338
[SPEAKER_25]: I think there's absolutely, you know, we thank you for, you know, again, voicing how important it is for, you know, everybody who needs access to the senior center and any, however they get there, whether it's by bus or by shuttle, by carpool,

212
00:36:41,758 --> 00:36:42,699
[SPEAKER_25]: or by driving themselves.

213
00:36:43,819 --> 00:36:46,281
[SPEAKER_25]: The senior center is so important to Medford Square.

214
00:36:46,361 --> 00:36:57,489
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm heartened to see, you know, in the mayor's, in the memo from the planning department that that has been reiterated to some of the development, sorry, some of the developers who went on that site walk, that that's been said to them.

215
00:36:57,949 --> 00:37:02,552
[SPEAKER_25]: But I think it's important that we, you know, continue to reiterate this priority, which is a priority.

216
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:08,056
[SPEAKER_25]: We have to make sure that people who need access to the senior center can continue to access it how they need to.

217
00:37:09,197 --> 00:37:13,539
[SPEAKER_25]: So we'll continue to help you emphasize that, and thank you for speaking to your concerns today.

218
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,380
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Vice President Collins.

219
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,801
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll go to Councilor Lazzaro.

220
00:37:18,122 --> 00:37:18,462
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

221
00:37:18,863 --> 00:37:30,730
[SPEAKER_03]: I also just wanted to reiterate that we appreciate the concerns, especially, I understand that every time I visited the Senior Center, it's an incredibly bustling place to visit.

222
00:37:32,331 --> 00:37:33,672
[SPEAKER_03]: All the activities are really well attended.

223
00:37:36,233 --> 00:37:40,499
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that mobility issues can be a big concern for folks who are there.

224
00:37:40,519 --> 00:37:42,402
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know that parking is very important.

225
00:37:42,582 --> 00:37:50,653
[SPEAKER_03]: And my hope would be that as the city reviews the proposals that parking is always and public parking parking that's available to be used.

226
00:37:51,333 --> 00:37:53,576
[SPEAKER_03]: would still be part of the buildings that they put there.

227
00:37:54,757 --> 00:38:00,282
[SPEAKER_03]: But Councilor Leming and I, we're members of the Resident Services Committee.

228
00:38:00,442 --> 00:38:04,966
[SPEAKER_03]: And as part of that, we did a listening session at the Senior Center a few months ago.

229
00:38:05,827 --> 00:38:08,710
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't super well attended, but it was the only only the first one we did.

230
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:12,974
[SPEAKER_03]: And we didn't have a chance to make it sort of a consistent thing.

231
00:38:13,074 --> 00:38:15,176
[SPEAKER_03]: But I would be excited to do that more often.

232
00:38:15,737 --> 00:38:24,439
[SPEAKER_03]: and have more opportunities for people to bring us what they're concerned about and tell us about the things like that, that are coming up more regularly that you're thinking about.

233
00:38:24,659 --> 00:38:34,942
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe if we can make it something that perhaps rotating members of city council that can come to the senior center and hear concerns from people, we can look into that in resident services and talk more about it.

234
00:38:36,202 --> 00:38:36,463
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

235
00:38:39,193 --> 00:38:41,294
[SPEAKER_13]: This is just a very brief comment.

236
00:38:41,314 --> 00:38:48,837
[SPEAKER_13]: So I do definitely hear what Marianne is saying about during any construction phase, it's likely that parking would be unavailable during that time.

237
00:38:48,877 --> 00:39:00,202
[SPEAKER_13]: But the RFP, just to really highlight this, the RFP does call for the construction of a parking garage in any developments that are created so long term.

238
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:09,673
[SPEAKER_13]: ideally going by what the RFP says, this wouldn't affect parking availability in the area.

239
00:39:09,874 --> 00:39:18,284
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's the idea, but I just wanted to, again, I'm hearing what Marianne is saying about the temporary unavailability during construction, but I did want to highlight that for folks in the room.

240
00:39:18,404 --> 00:39:18,685
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

241
00:39:19,915 --> 00:39:20,275
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

242
00:39:20,335 --> 00:39:20,575
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

243
00:39:20,655 --> 00:39:28,958
[SPEAKER_08]: And just procedurally, um, the next steps as far as I understand it, the memo mentioned that responses will be due December 20th.

244
00:39:29,618 --> 00:39:35,240
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe then the planning department would come to this body to request our approval to authorize a land lease.

245
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:42,342
[SPEAKER_08]: So there would be further public meetings regarding the proposal, and it would require a vote of the council to authorize the city to lease the land.

246
00:39:43,917 --> 00:39:48,019
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm just saying that that's the next steps for the RFP, sorry.

247
00:39:48,759 --> 00:39:51,460
[SPEAKER_08]: But we will go to comments and everyone will have three minutes.

248
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:54,882
[SPEAKER_08]: Give me one second as I figure out our new microphone system.

249
00:39:59,724 --> 00:40:00,845
[SPEAKER_08]: Name and address for the record, please.

250
00:40:00,865 --> 00:40:03,866
[SPEAKER_22]: My name is Cynthia Warden, 100 High Street, Medford.

251
00:40:04,466 --> 00:40:12,570
[SPEAKER_22]: There was a presentation at the senior center before the mayor's election, and we were told a lot about it.

252
00:40:14,253 --> 00:40:16,614
[SPEAKER_22]: There was definitely not enough parking spaces.

253
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:20,396
[SPEAKER_22]: Most of the seniors are physically handicapped, medically handicapped.

254
00:40:20,756 --> 00:40:23,138
[SPEAKER_22]: It's a lifeline for the people in Medford.

255
00:40:23,558 --> 00:40:24,598
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm getting all choked up.

256
00:40:25,099 --> 00:40:33,423
[SPEAKER_22]: I've had experiences with people whose spouses have died and they were able to come to the senior center and to save their lives.

257
00:40:34,383 --> 00:40:37,585
[SPEAKER_22]: It's like they're blatantly forgetting the seniors in Medford.

258
00:40:41,987 --> 00:40:43,028
[SPEAKER_22]: That's enough, that says it.

259
00:40:49,281 --> 00:40:50,302
[SPEAKER_08]: name and address for the record.

260
00:40:50,322 --> 00:40:50,862
[SPEAKER_08]: You have three minutes.

261
00:40:51,243 --> 00:40:54,365
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm Elizabeth Creamer, 60 Pleasant Street in Medford.

262
00:40:54,986 --> 00:40:57,027
[SPEAKER_12]: And not to repeat what other people have said.

263
00:40:57,047 --> 00:41:04,554
[SPEAKER_12]: I may have missed some of what you said, but I have concerns about the parking at the senior at the parking lot near the senior center.

264
00:41:05,234 --> 00:41:16,944
[SPEAKER_12]: I go there several times a week myself, and I often circle around many times and end up parking back on Riverside app down near the stores or back behind CBS.

265
00:41:17,945 --> 00:41:18,065
[SPEAKER_12]: And

266
00:41:19,827 --> 00:41:27,590
[SPEAKER_12]: When you think about the winter coming, it's not really acceptable that you would have to park that far away to go to the senior center.

267
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:30,271
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm one of the lucky ones that are still able to drive.

268
00:41:30,371 --> 00:41:39,294
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm in my 80s, but not everybody can walk as easily as when they're younger.

269
00:41:40,555 --> 00:41:42,275
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm concerned about that.

270
00:41:43,636 --> 00:41:47,197
[SPEAKER_12]: Despite what people say, there is a lack of parking there.

271
00:41:47,597 --> 00:41:48,938
[SPEAKER_12]: And as you heard before,

272
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:59,664
[SPEAKER_12]: From January until October, there was 8,787 cars that parked there to go to the senior center.

273
00:42:00,445 --> 00:42:03,328
[SPEAKER_12]: And many of these people take people with them.

274
00:42:03,348 --> 00:42:07,291
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a very vital center.

275
00:42:07,952 --> 00:42:11,535
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a lot for people's health and wellness and their well-being.

276
00:42:12,136 --> 00:42:14,698
[SPEAKER_12]: And I really hope that you will consider parking

277
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:26,290
[SPEAKER_12]: for the seniors and not to be thinking that we can just go far away and get parked and park somewhere and still be able to get to the center.

278
00:42:26,370 --> 00:42:27,190
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not going to be.

279
00:42:27,871 --> 00:42:31,034
[SPEAKER_12]: I know what it's like in the wintertime when CVS was open.

280
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:36,503
[SPEAKER_12]: know, the parking lot near the senior center is well plowed.

281
00:42:36,623 --> 00:42:37,784
[SPEAKER_12]: It's well taken care of.

282
00:42:38,364 --> 00:42:40,446
[SPEAKER_12]: But the streets around are not.

283
00:42:40,646 --> 00:42:45,309
[SPEAKER_12]: There's snow banks, there's ice, and it is really hazardous.

284
00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:50,053
[SPEAKER_12]: And just another little thought about the pop-up park.

285
00:42:53,146 --> 00:42:59,289
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know where the common sense is of putting a pop-up park in a parking lot when parking is needed.

286
00:43:00,409 --> 00:43:01,950
[SPEAKER_12]: There's no green space there.

287
00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:03,010
[SPEAKER_12]: There's no trees.

288
00:43:03,090 --> 00:43:04,071
[SPEAKER_12]: There's no shade.

289
00:43:06,211 --> 00:43:08,032
[SPEAKER_12]: Just my opinion.

290
00:43:08,112 --> 00:43:09,573
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for listening to me.

291
00:43:09,593 --> 00:43:10,613
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

292
00:43:10,633 --> 00:43:11,253
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

293
00:43:17,416 --> 00:43:18,516
[SPEAKER_08]: Name and address for the record.

294
00:43:19,117 --> 00:43:19,877
[SPEAKER_08]: You have three minutes.

295
00:43:20,322 --> 00:43:23,085
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening, Claudia Fennelly 36 Farragut Ave.

296
00:43:24,126 --> 00:43:34,275
[SPEAKER_00]: I do thank you, Chairman Sachs for reviewing the proposal, because I had heard about the 99 year lease and I have to say at the outset that I was pretty.

297
00:43:34,796 --> 00:43:41,662
[SPEAKER_00]: It took me back to the days of Ozzie and Harriet because honestly, it's a very anti progressive.

298
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:55,285
[SPEAKER_00]: proposal for 99 year lease because the city and the growth of the city that is anticipated and what it actually turns out to be in reality in the future are two separate things.

299
00:43:55,926 --> 00:43:58,126
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that the city benefits by that.

300
00:43:58,286 --> 00:44:00,026
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a short term solution.

301
00:44:02,567 --> 00:44:07,628
[SPEAKER_00]: The comments today about the senior center as I do go to the senior center are all valid.

302
00:44:09,028 --> 00:44:16,157
[SPEAKER_00]: What I have observed in Meffitt Square is that the parking lots usage is event driven.

303
00:44:16,618 --> 00:44:27,331
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have the Chevalier, Deep Cuts, the senior center, and they're all at different senior centers usually during the day, first thing.

304
00:44:28,254 --> 00:44:29,655
[SPEAKER_00]: the Chevalier is at night.

305
00:44:30,015 --> 00:44:32,217
[SPEAKER_00]: When those events happen, your lots are full.

306
00:44:33,078 --> 00:44:40,443
[SPEAKER_00]: You have off hours and that's probably what you observe as the not in use aspect of it.

307
00:44:40,903 --> 00:44:54,514
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I am very concerned about just tossing these parking lots out without getting the public's interest and input because Chevalier

308
00:44:55,334 --> 00:44:58,216
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't plan it right, it's a wonderful asset.

309
00:44:58,776 --> 00:45:00,457
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes Medford progressive.

310
00:45:01,318 --> 00:45:10,003
[SPEAKER_00]: But if they can't get people to park in the area, which parking is a challenge when you have a big popular event, then you're going to lose revenue.

311
00:45:10,623 --> 00:45:20,509
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a fine balance between looking at housing, business, retail, concert venues, music venues.

312
00:45:20,990 --> 00:45:22,431
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a juggling act.

313
00:45:24,028 --> 00:45:28,530
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to bring in revenue in order to make all these possibilities happen.

314
00:45:28,911 --> 00:45:35,194
[SPEAKER_00]: So my question I have for the council here is how are you allowing the

315
00:45:36,701 --> 00:45:56,062
[SPEAKER_00]: Chevalier the method public library, the deep cuts, and the restaurants that are drawing in revenue and people, how are you allowing them to have an input a say in the proposal for the parking lots, because that is going to determine the outlook for the city and its growth aspect in years to come.

316
00:45:57,704 --> 00:46:03,927
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you've heard, the seniors mentioned that during their usage during the day, it's insufficient.

317
00:46:04,327 --> 00:46:17,454
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you take away that lot, the senior center will be impacted, which by the way, if you look at other senior centers in other cities, Medford is really very active and has a lot of activities.

318
00:46:18,375 --> 00:46:21,236
[SPEAKER_00]: And that brings in other people from other cities as well.

319
00:46:22,337 --> 00:46:25,359
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was just wondering how you plan to address

320
00:46:25,999 --> 00:46:30,672
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses and include their input for the plan of these parking lots.

321
00:46:32,383 --> 00:46:32,823
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

322
00:46:32,843 --> 00:46:37,946
[SPEAKER_08]: I can speak to the process that the planning department is working on.

323
00:46:37,986 --> 00:46:42,709
[SPEAKER_08]: I spoke with the planning director, Alicia Hunt, and she was at the Chamber of Commerce.

324
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:50,754
[SPEAKER_08]: I think last week they had a day where all the businesses in the square could meet with her and kind of have conversations about this.

325
00:46:51,294 --> 00:46:58,499
[SPEAKER_08]: That includes the current chair is the Chevalier manager, Andrew Mather, and

326
00:46:59,539 --> 00:47:06,761
[SPEAKER_08]: So that was something that happened, and I know that she relayed to me that there was a lot of excitement, but they did want to be engaged specifically around this question of parking.

327
00:47:07,602 --> 00:47:26,308
[SPEAKER_08]: And one of the things that they were looking at, and I don't know if it's going to happen as part of this project, and it really depends on the proposals that come in from the people who are proposing, was seeing if the parking garage that is attached to Atrius Health could be redeveloped to be a more public parking garage.

328
00:47:27,548 --> 00:47:35,552
[SPEAKER_08]: so that during the day it could be used by the health folks and at night potentially be used for other uses, because right now it's closed at night.

329
00:47:36,712 --> 00:47:40,514
[SPEAKER_08]: But I don't think that would be the only answer, but that was just an idea that I had heard.

330
00:47:41,895 --> 00:47:48,878
[SPEAKER_08]: In any case, there was a meeting with the Chamber of Commerce specifically about these RFPs with the businesses in the square.

331
00:47:48,898 --> 00:47:51,659
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

332
00:47:54,909 --> 00:47:59,396
[SPEAKER_08]: Does anyone else want to speak on the topic Councilor Tseng, Thank you.

333
00:48:03,479 --> 00:48:06,641
[SPEAKER_18]: Just wanted to thank our seniors for taking time out of their evenings to come here.

334
00:48:06,701 --> 00:48:11,004
[SPEAKER_18]: I know it's not the easiest and raising more attention about this issue.

335
00:48:11,444 --> 00:48:15,407
[SPEAKER_18]: It is an issue I've, I heard at the senior center last time I visited.

336
00:48:16,508 --> 00:48:24,053
[SPEAKER_18]: It's an issue that I know the planning department has spoken to me a little bit about in our meetings about development in Medford Square.

337
00:48:24,133 --> 00:48:26,995
[SPEAKER_18]: But I think it's really important to reiterate that

338
00:48:27,515 --> 00:48:42,439
[SPEAKER_18]: The, this is just the very beginning of the RFP process that will have to look at the projects that are proposed that come in, there'll be public, there'll be public meetings about it I think at that time we'll have to make sure that we extend an invite to the members of the senior center as well.

339
00:48:43,219 --> 00:48:54,668
[SPEAKER_18]: to make sure that, you know, what I'm hearing is that there's a need for parking, but it's not just the need for parking, it's a need for a transition plan while we do the development, the growth that we need to do in Medford Square as well.

340
00:48:55,429 --> 00:49:05,217
[SPEAKER_18]: And so leveraging things like the Atrius Hall parking lot, leveraging spaces that aren't open right now, I think will become an important part of that transition plan.

341
00:49:05,237 --> 00:49:10,241
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think part of that needed conversation with our planning department, and I know the planning department's already

342
00:49:11,761 --> 00:49:13,222
[SPEAKER_18]: talking about a lot of these issues.

343
00:49:14,443 --> 00:49:16,645
[SPEAKER_18]: There can always be more community engagement.

344
00:49:17,385 --> 00:49:26,292
[SPEAKER_18]: There's always a need to balance our growing square, our growing revenue sources in the square with the lived reality on the ground as well.

345
00:49:26,472 --> 00:49:30,015
[SPEAKER_18]: So I wanted to, again, thank you guys for coming in today.

346
00:49:30,815 --> 00:49:39,482
[SPEAKER_18]: And I know there are folks from the planning department watching this meeting, and I hope that that becomes part of the conversation too.

347
00:49:42,910 --> 00:49:43,450
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

348
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:47,292
[SPEAKER_08]: Any further discussion on this public participation petition?

349
00:49:48,892 --> 00:49:49,912
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Callahan.

350
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:01,817
[SPEAKER_07]: One second, please.

351
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:12,725
[SPEAKER_19]: really important that you hear the beeps.

352
00:50:12,845 --> 00:50:14,646
[SPEAKER_08]: I need your name and address for the record to start off.

353
00:50:14,726 --> 00:50:17,067
[SPEAKER_19]: It's Lorna Jane Beckwith.

354
00:50:17,168 --> 00:50:17,608
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

355
00:50:17,828 --> 00:50:19,069
[SPEAKER_19]: And I live in West Medford.

356
00:50:19,429 --> 00:50:19,769
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

357
00:50:19,829 --> 00:50:22,190
[SPEAKER_19]: But I pick up people all over to go.

358
00:50:23,151 --> 00:50:32,415
[SPEAKER_19]: So what I'm trying to say is, I think when it comes to revenue and money, the seniors are going to be tossed out and I feel it.

359
00:50:33,356 --> 00:50:35,637
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'd like you to like, tell me that isn't true.

360
00:50:35,937 --> 00:50:36,838
[SPEAKER_19]: But I think it is.

361
00:50:38,444 --> 00:50:45,847
[SPEAKER_19]: Because if you say the atrius, that's for people that are getting medical help and it's full.

362
00:50:49,228 --> 00:50:51,549
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a nice idea, but it's not real.

363
00:50:52,570 --> 00:50:56,631
[SPEAKER_19]: We need definite parking or we can't go to the senior center.

364
00:50:57,532 --> 00:51:00,333
[SPEAKER_19]: Just like in West Medford, we need a path.

365
00:51:01,453 --> 00:51:03,614
[SPEAKER_19]: It's taking eight years to get that path.

366
00:51:06,085 --> 00:51:08,567
[SPEAKER_19]: You really need to consider seniors in the city.

367
00:51:08,867 --> 00:51:16,252
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, I know that the youth, you're important, the schools are important, but the seniors have built this city.

368
00:51:17,293 --> 00:51:22,417
[SPEAKER_19]: We've grown up here and we've given ourselves to the city of Medford, and I think you need to consider us.

369
00:51:22,437 --> 00:51:29,142
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's why I brought up the grief group, because some of us are alive because of those grief groups.

370
00:51:30,302 --> 00:51:35,366
[SPEAKER_19]: So think on that, you're young, you don't have to deal with this yet, but you will, it's coming.

371
00:51:36,334 --> 00:51:42,565
[SPEAKER_19]: ability, vision, all these things are coming, believe me, and I'm still young at heart.

372
00:51:44,148 --> 00:51:44,529
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

373
00:51:44,549 --> 00:51:49,558
[SPEAKER_08]: Go to Councilor Callahan, then we'll go back to the microphone for public participation.

374
00:51:52,782 --> 00:51:58,006
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to note that I was actually kind of peeking through the RFP.

375
00:51:58,946 --> 00:52:09,053
[SPEAKER_04]: Just now, definitely it specifically calls out the parking of the senior center that that must be that that must be like.

376
00:52:10,314 --> 00:52:28,170
[SPEAKER_04]: I think replaced or continued at least the number of parking spaces, but it also talks about the idea that the parking that is created has to not only consider the senior center, but it also has to account for new business development in the square.

377
00:52:28,670 --> 00:52:33,214
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm not saying that what's in the RFP, sorry, I'll talk to the, I'm supposed to talk to the chair.

378
00:52:33,814 --> 00:52:37,377
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not saying that what's in the RFP is definitely what

379
00:52:38,118 --> 00:52:39,559
[SPEAKER_04]: will happen in the end product.

380
00:52:39,899 --> 00:52:46,243
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think that it just so that you know, it is in the RFP specifically that those requests are there.

381
00:52:47,244 --> 00:52:53,988
[SPEAKER_04]: And then this you coming to this meeting is absolutely fantastic, because, you know, it has to come through this body.

382
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:56,790
[SPEAKER_04]: So we are now extra aware.

383
00:52:56,810 --> 00:53:00,553
[SPEAKER_04]: I also would love to be in one of the future

384
00:53:01,053 --> 00:53:03,074
[SPEAKER_04]: listening sessions at the senior center.

385
00:53:04,094 --> 00:53:07,676
[SPEAKER_04]: And we can even specifically bring up this topic of the RFP.

386
00:53:08,956 --> 00:53:16,399
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, as we go forward, I think there will be other public meetings about the development that is going to be done.

387
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:22,362
[SPEAKER_04]: So I really appreciate all of your comments, and we will take them to heart and we will, you know, make sure to

388
00:53:22,862 --> 00:53:37,027
[SPEAKER_04]: be pushing forward as the RFP moves forward through the process, that we will make sure that not only are there enough spaces for the senior center, but also for the growing needs of parking in Medford Square as it grows.

389
00:53:41,474 --> 00:53:41,814
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

390
00:53:41,834 --> 00:53:45,676
[SPEAKER_11]: I just just a point of information maybe some clarity for the planning department.

391
00:53:46,137 --> 00:53:54,742
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that the question that was reported back to me that part of the RP that the mentioned the mayor mentioned was that it was a looking at 40 spots.

392
00:53:56,881 --> 00:53:57,801
[SPEAKER_11]: for the new developers.

393
00:53:57,841 --> 00:53:59,383
[SPEAKER_11]: So that doesn't even come close.

394
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:03,026
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think this is why having this conversation is a beginning.

395
00:54:03,506 --> 00:54:12,474
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think it's before it gets too late because we're down the line with other projects in the city that our community hasn't been involved.

396
00:54:12,514 --> 00:54:17,399
[SPEAKER_11]: And when I say community, it's having those meetings at the senior center.

397
00:54:18,243 --> 00:54:22,064
[SPEAKER_11]: when you set a vision of what you want this to look like, what you want Meffitt Square to look like.

398
00:54:22,504 --> 00:54:29,126
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is where you bring in the business community, because some business members that were at that chamber meeting, really, they weren't very excited.

399
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:30,186
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's some question.

400
00:54:30,606 --> 00:54:32,927
[SPEAKER_11]: But that's why you have these meetings open to everybody.

401
00:54:33,547 --> 00:54:41,349
[SPEAKER_11]: And you sit there with all the department heads, your planning department, your recreation department, your fire department, your police department, because there's so many things that

402
00:54:42,284 --> 00:54:45,794
[SPEAKER_11]: when you look at development that have to be considered, right?

403
00:54:46,455 --> 00:54:48,200
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we, if we build this many

404
00:54:48,977 --> 00:54:53,280
[SPEAKER_11]: we bring in this many people, are we going to have the infrastructure DPW can carry?

405
00:54:53,620 --> 00:54:56,683
[SPEAKER_11]: If we build it, bring in this many people, are we going to have enough police?

406
00:54:56,923 --> 00:54:57,763
[SPEAKER_11]: Are we going to have fire?

407
00:54:58,344 --> 00:55:07,210
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's so many, so many, and I only speak on this on as, as, as person who does this as a department head in the past, I worked for municipality.

408
00:55:07,590 --> 00:55:16,437
[SPEAKER_11]: And what we do is before, before the city came out and just started giving out RFPs and getting the idea of the developers, because that's the problem with Medford.

409
00:55:17,017 --> 00:55:19,318
[SPEAKER_11]: we bring the developers in to get their idea first.

410
00:55:19,738 --> 00:55:20,738
[SPEAKER_11]: Isn't that, that's a shame.

411
00:55:21,138 --> 00:55:34,683
[SPEAKER_11]: So the issue is in other communities what happens is you bring your stakeholders in first with the plans that were were derived that Medford has spent millions of dollars on that dust some of those off and say well these plans say this.

412
00:55:35,443 --> 00:55:37,124
[SPEAKER_11]: So where do you feel and what do you fit?

413
00:55:37,144 --> 00:55:40,045
[SPEAKER_11]: So the first thing we see is our senior citizens have already come out and said what?

414
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:47,342
[SPEAKER_11]: We're scared that we're going to be overlooked and bypassed because one of the basic necessities we have is parking.

415
00:55:48,263 --> 00:55:51,984
[SPEAKER_11]: So that could be something that you look at at a meeting like that.

416
00:55:52,044 --> 00:56:08,750
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm hoping that the mayor really, really readjust and understand the process when it comes to the December proposals that come in, that we reassess again and look at the true process of true development and true input from our community, where we bring the meeting to you

417
00:56:10,583 --> 00:56:18,226
[SPEAKER_11]: Not somewhere that you have to find one, you have to find where this meeting is and then go out and look for it and then not have the proper people in that can answer the questions.

418
00:56:18,606 --> 00:56:21,026
[SPEAKER_11]: But neighboring communities, what they do is they bring everybody in.

419
00:56:21,947 --> 00:56:23,747
[SPEAKER_11]: So every question is answered right there.

420
00:56:24,468 --> 00:56:29,189
[SPEAKER_11]: So then we could set up a comprehensive plan that involves all the stakeholders.

421
00:56:30,149 --> 00:56:34,511
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, that means that not everybody's gonna be happy with some of the decisions.

422
00:56:35,396 --> 00:56:37,097
[SPEAKER_11]: but at least they can look at outcomes.

423
00:56:37,157 --> 00:56:44,659
[SPEAKER_11]: I know one of the things we talked about in my neighboring community was it was affecting the process for one of our senior areas in Union Square.

424
00:56:45,219 --> 00:56:59,763
[SPEAKER_11]: So part of the deal was that we would have a shuttle system in place that would be built in with the developers that we don't need senior citizens who didn't need the parking in that area for it was identified for a small group, I think it was 50 people.

425
00:57:00,419 --> 00:57:05,521
[SPEAKER_11]: So they looked at how they would shuttle the seniors in, and that was part of the contract.

426
00:57:06,121 --> 00:57:07,881
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's being creative.

427
00:57:08,081 --> 00:57:14,984
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, that's at least giving you an option to give you calm and understand that people are looking out for you.

428
00:57:15,004 --> 00:57:21,826
[SPEAKER_11]: Because a friend that came up to the podium said that our seniors are afraid that we're being forgotten.

429
00:57:21,846 --> 00:57:22,826
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I hear you.

430
00:57:23,777 --> 00:57:29,122
[SPEAKER_11]: I've heard that in the last, especially three months in the process, we're seeing what's happening on election day.

431
00:57:29,162 --> 00:57:31,164
[SPEAKER_11]: We hear you, at least I hear you.

432
00:57:31,844 --> 00:57:40,612
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think we need to really put our money where our mouth is and really start opening up the dialogue with the most vulnerable members of our community, unfortunately, which are our seniors.

433
00:57:40,632 --> 00:57:41,793
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you, Councilor Bearsley.

434
00:57:42,992 --> 00:57:43,352
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

435
00:57:43,392 --> 00:57:44,754
[SPEAKER_08]: I do want to just make a point.

436
00:57:45,094 --> 00:57:53,902
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't disagree with what you said and engaging people is really important, but I just want to be clear that going to the RFP was not the first thing as part of this process.

437
00:57:54,743 --> 00:57:59,948
[SPEAKER_08]: This process references the 2017 Medford Square plan under Mayor Burke.

438
00:57:59,988 --> 00:58:03,071
[SPEAKER_08]: There was a 2019 evaluation of development potential under Mayor Burke.

439
00:58:03,671 --> 00:58:06,712
[SPEAKER_08]: the 2022 housing plan and the 2022 draft comprehensive plan.

440
00:58:07,232 --> 00:58:14,034
[SPEAKER_08]: And there were multiple community meetings last year before the drafting of this RFP, including two at the senior center.

441
00:58:14,214 --> 00:58:16,415
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, that work has happened.

442
00:58:16,475 --> 00:58:22,677
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe not everyone went to every meeting, but when we talk about what happened, I just think that should be noted.

443
00:58:23,397 --> 00:58:28,719
[SPEAKER_08]: There was two public meetings at the senior center talking about this project and the transforming the square initiative.

444
00:58:32,921 --> 00:58:39,325
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the concern with that response was that not everybody is getting informed.

445
00:58:39,725 --> 00:58:40,946
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what I'm hearing from everybody.

446
00:58:41,506 --> 00:58:43,867
[SPEAKER_11]: You might just check a box and say, we're having a meeting.

447
00:58:44,267 --> 00:58:46,709
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, I understand the comprehensive plans that have been going on for years.

448
00:58:46,729 --> 00:58:48,570
[SPEAKER_11]: We spend millions of dollars on it, Council President.

449
00:58:48,970 --> 00:58:52,172
[SPEAKER_11]: But what we're seeing, what I'm hearing, especially firsthand from our seniors, is

450
00:58:53,385 --> 00:59:08,818
[SPEAKER_11]: people are getting surveyed that then they say there's a survey of people say they've been spoken to people said there were meetings, but no one really knows when it seems like just a certain group understands against this message, because the average person, and you can look at what we have here in the auditorium today.

451
00:59:09,298 --> 00:59:10,339
[SPEAKER_11]: they're not getting the message.

452
00:59:10,359 --> 00:59:22,748
[SPEAKER_11]: So if that's the case, Council President, we need to do a better job as a community and a leadership in the city is to educate all of our members of our community so they can get involved with these processes.

453
00:59:22,788 --> 00:59:23,528
[SPEAKER_11]: So again, thank you.

454
00:59:24,569 --> 00:59:25,050
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

455
00:59:25,070 --> 00:59:26,651
[SPEAKER_08]: And I certainly don't disagree with that.

456
00:59:27,151 --> 00:59:30,193
[SPEAKER_08]: I do know that the office worked with the senior center to get the word out.

457
00:59:31,522 --> 00:59:36,627
[SPEAKER_08]: And I am hopeful, again, we heard from Dan Kennedy recently online about a city newspaper.

458
00:59:37,027 --> 00:59:45,334
[SPEAKER_08]: We need that level of information and resource, but there have been meetings and we do do as much outreach as we can.

459
00:59:45,414 --> 00:59:48,417
[SPEAKER_08]: And that doesn't always reach everyone, even when we try to reach everyone.

460
00:59:48,437 --> 00:59:50,539
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll go to Councilor Singh.

461
00:59:52,335 --> 01:00:10,396
[SPEAKER_18]: Something I did forget to mention and I think is in the vein of in a similar vein is that something the city, the planning department and different departments in the city is working hard on right now and I sat in on a bunch of these meetings is, is the transportation task force, which specifically is.

462
01:00:12,418 --> 01:00:19,603
[SPEAKER_18]: looks at transportation needs across the city, but especially for seniors, that's the main crux of the work that the task force is doing right now.

463
01:00:20,844 --> 01:00:35,394
[SPEAKER_18]: Of course, a lot of it's understanding where people are coming from, getting to, how people are getting to the senior center, how can we make that more efficient, how we can make that suit the needs of what seniors are doing right now.

464
01:00:36,694 --> 01:00:41,816
[SPEAKER_18]: And a lot of these questions, I think, are part of the conversations that that task force is having.

465
01:00:42,957 --> 01:00:47,338
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a survey out that the city's working hard with the senior center to push out.

466
01:00:47,418 --> 01:00:59,202
[SPEAKER_18]: And I know because there are seniors here and seniors watching online, I just wanted to bring attention, bring awareness to that survey that's out there right now and to the work that the city's doing.

467
01:00:59,983 --> 01:01:02,224
[SPEAKER_18]: And so this is a good time for seniors to be,

468
01:01:03,784 --> 01:01:10,466
[SPEAKER_18]: coming to City Council meetings, letting us and different department staff know about those transportation needs.

469
01:01:12,987 --> 01:01:13,427
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

470
01:01:13,667 --> 01:01:18,468
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll go to the podium, name and address for the record, and you'll have three minutes.

471
01:01:19,368 --> 01:01:21,809
[SPEAKER_26]: Paulette Vartabedian, Central Lab Medford.

472
01:01:22,269 --> 01:01:32,712
[SPEAKER_26]: I apologize if this was addressed prior to my coming here because I was a bit late, but has anything been discussed as far as

473
01:01:33,251 --> 01:01:43,379
[SPEAKER_26]: where the senior parking is and or behind Colleen's at that parking lot to make it a parking garage where the parking goes up.

474
01:01:45,901 --> 01:01:51,226
[SPEAKER_08]: In terms of the Colleen's behind there, that's not part of the scope of the request for proposal.

475
01:01:51,246 --> 01:02:01,314
[SPEAKER_26]: No, I understand, but as we're talking about developing Medford Square and how there's problems with parking, if Chevalier has an issue or not an issue,

476
01:02:01,761 --> 01:02:05,102
[SPEAKER_26]: an event or some of the other places.

477
01:02:05,142 --> 01:02:11,385
[SPEAKER_26]: We have a lot of new, very popular restaurants in Medford Square and parking is an issue.

478
01:02:11,765 --> 01:02:21,569
[SPEAKER_26]: So the senior center parking, if that becomes a parking garage, that's great, but it's at one end of the city.

479
01:02:21,829 --> 01:02:27,872
[SPEAKER_26]: If there was something that was more centrally located in addition as a parking garage,

480
01:02:28,291 --> 01:02:35,295
[SPEAKER_26]: where there's just one level of parking now behind Colleen's just think that that's something that needs to be looked at, if it hasn't already.

481
01:02:35,515 --> 01:02:35,855
[SPEAKER_26]: That's all.

482
01:02:36,215 --> 01:02:36,576
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

483
01:02:36,616 --> 01:02:36,936
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

484
01:02:43,459 --> 01:02:45,160
[SPEAKER_08]: Name and address the record, you have three minutes.

485
01:02:47,441 --> 01:02:56,566
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Council President Andrew Castagnettititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititi, I live two blocks east of the Senior Citizen Center in East Medford.

486
01:02:58,396 --> 01:03:08,840
[SPEAKER_21]: I've been a member for some years of the Senior Citizen Center, and parking can be a problem at times, especially if they have one of those potty type things.

487
01:03:10,181 --> 01:03:18,924
[SPEAKER_21]: And I'm not against development because without future development, we will shrink economically.

488
01:03:24,517 --> 01:03:28,359
[SPEAKER_21]: However, I can understand their concern because they're having a hard time getting around.

489
01:03:29,139 --> 01:03:30,140
[SPEAKER_21]: And so am I at times.

490
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:35,983
[SPEAKER_21]: And it's hard to walk, you know, a couple of hundred yards from Brigham's or Colleen's as you call it.

491
01:03:37,884 --> 01:03:51,250
[SPEAKER_21]: So more importantly, I believe it was Councilor Lemmy had mentioned that for sure, or maybe, maybe through the chair and over the rail, he could,

492
01:03:53,322 --> 01:03:56,344
[SPEAKER_21]: Go over this for me to be a parking garage.

493
01:03:56,864 --> 01:03:59,986
[SPEAKER_21]: And how many units would that be for parking spaces?

494
01:04:00,406 --> 01:04:01,787
[SPEAKER_21]: How tall of a garage?

495
01:04:02,267 --> 01:04:03,367
[SPEAKER_21]: Is there an elevator?

496
01:04:04,328 --> 01:04:05,288
[SPEAKER_21]: Things of that nature.

497
01:04:05,669 --> 01:04:08,570
[SPEAKER_21]: And designated for the senior citizens, how many spots?

498
01:04:08,990 --> 01:04:09,851
[SPEAKER_21]: If you have the answers.

499
01:04:10,669 --> 01:04:22,254
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so we don't have the proposals yet, but the request for proposals document says that parking is a priority and that the senior center parking needs to be replaced in full no matter what develops.

500
01:04:22,474 --> 01:04:26,216
[SPEAKER_08]: But the specific proposals such as height, et cetera, hasn't come out yet.

501
01:04:26,276 --> 01:04:31,138
[SPEAKER_08]: And that won't be out until after December 20th, which is the deadline for the proposals.

502
01:04:32,439 --> 01:04:32,519
[SPEAKER_21]: OK.

503
01:04:34,207 --> 01:04:37,270
[SPEAKER_21]: Again, I'm not against development because that's important.

504
01:04:37,330 --> 01:04:39,871
[SPEAKER_21]: Mystic Ave should have been done when they moved there in 1955.

505
01:04:39,951 --> 01:04:44,735
[SPEAKER_21]: This is the same, five years later, they built Route 93.

506
01:04:45,255 --> 01:04:48,297
[SPEAKER_21]: So the old highway to Boston is where the development should actually go.

507
01:04:49,178 --> 01:04:51,559
[SPEAKER_21]: Mystic Ave, the old highway, Route 38.

508
01:04:52,600 --> 01:05:00,105
[SPEAKER_21]: And if I remember correctly, the original builder of the hotel, the original builder,

509
01:05:01,179 --> 01:05:05,241
[SPEAKER_21]: It didn't work out, he failed because of political reasons, I believe.

510
01:05:05,841 --> 01:05:17,645
[SPEAKER_21]: He was going to build a hotel there where it is now, and he was going to make some grand or type of entrance way to the river, which is something we never should have turned our backs on.

511
01:05:17,665 --> 01:05:23,568
[SPEAKER_21]: In Georgetown, Virginia, they built it on the river with their decks and their entertainment.

512
01:05:23,828 --> 01:05:25,609
[SPEAKER_21]: We turned our back to the river.

513
01:05:25,809 --> 01:05:26,789
[SPEAKER_21]: That was a big mistake.

514
01:05:27,546 --> 01:05:33,253
[SPEAKER_21]: So, so I want to say, and I wanted to talk during public participation about something.

515
01:05:33,714 --> 01:05:41,383
[SPEAKER_21]: Would that be now it's a different subject are you going to hold it open for me later on, sir, I'm going to finish out this subject and then we will take you after that.

516
01:05:42,484 --> 01:05:42,845
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

517
01:05:44,387 --> 01:05:46,830
[SPEAKER_08]: Any further discussion on this subject counselor Callahan.

518
01:05:48,987 --> 01:06:02,411
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a thought as we were discussing this because I and I do remember going to some of those public participation community events organized by the planning department to discuss these three lots.

519
01:06:03,391 --> 01:06:09,733
[SPEAKER_04]: And I, I wonder if there is something of a timing problem because you know that was

520
01:06:10,473 --> 01:06:14,315
[SPEAKER_04]: At least it was a year and a half ago, or over a year ago for sure.

521
01:06:14,335 --> 01:06:20,918
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think what may happen is that when it's so far away from a reality.

522
01:06:22,599 --> 01:06:27,742
[SPEAKER_04]: People might not realize that it's going to impact them.

523
01:06:29,163 --> 01:06:34,127
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when it becomes like now there's an actual RFP and it's already been sent out.

524
01:06:34,488 --> 01:06:35,849
[SPEAKER_04]: And so now people are worried.

525
01:06:36,850 --> 01:06:53,404
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm wondering if maybe, you know, we can have like just a chit chat with the administration and talk about maybe having, spreading the community meetings in such a way that there are some community meetings closer to

526
01:06:54,425 --> 01:07:05,117
[SPEAKER_04]: or like before or after an RFP goes out, because now that it's becoming a reality I think people are realizing the way that it's going to impact their lives in a way that a year and a half ago.

527
01:07:05,137 --> 01:07:13,326
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't, it didn't seem like something to attend so anyway, I'm just thinking about that as something that maybe

528
01:07:13,826 --> 01:07:27,900
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, if the administration is in fact, you know, we are having these community meetings, but the timing isn't lining up with what people need in terms of it being really applicable to their lives and then wanting to take the time out to come to these community meetings.

529
01:07:28,861 --> 01:07:35,288
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think I may just have a little, and I might talk to some folks in the administration about that possibility of changing the timing of some of those.

530
01:07:36,088 --> 01:07:36,969
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I would just note.

531
01:07:38,681 --> 01:07:40,622
[SPEAKER_08]: that we did receive that they were well attended.

532
01:07:41,502 --> 01:07:45,104
[SPEAKER_08]: We could probably get more information about that to share with folks.

533
01:07:45,664 --> 01:07:47,845
[SPEAKER_08]: And I believe there are recordings available online as well.

534
01:07:49,006 --> 01:07:57,650
[SPEAKER_08]: But it does tend to be as part of the planning process that you spend a the time to do the comprehensive plan, then you spend the time to do the community outreach, and then you put together the proposal.

535
01:07:57,710 --> 01:08:00,911
[SPEAKER_08]: And then again, right, like, that's not the end of the public process.

536
01:08:01,391 --> 01:08:03,712
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's a multi year multi stage planning process.

537
01:08:03,892 --> 01:08:04,092
[SPEAKER_08]: But

538
01:08:05,973 --> 01:08:14,117
[SPEAKER_08]: We're having a conversation right now, and people can come to any council meeting and talk about it, but we also will have further public meetings and public hearings as the process goes forward.

539
01:08:21,060 --> 01:08:27,783
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, Lorna Jane Beckwith, and I live at 9 Walkland Court, apartment F. I was at both of those meetings.

540
01:08:28,024 --> 01:08:29,124
[SPEAKER_19]: I remember Alicia Hunt.

541
01:08:29,704 --> 01:08:32,866
[SPEAKER_19]: I remember who came representing the mayor.

542
01:08:34,201 --> 01:08:39,069
[SPEAKER_19]: we were still very clear as seniors of what we needed.

543
01:08:39,650 --> 01:08:45,138
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's why we've been keeping track of how many of us park there, why we know there's 8,000.

544
01:08:47,731 --> 01:08:50,212
[SPEAKER_19]: because we're very clear of what we need.

545
01:08:50,972 --> 01:08:55,854
[SPEAKER_19]: Not that it was far away, we were saying, no, we want to stay as a senior center.

546
01:08:56,595 --> 01:09:03,317
[SPEAKER_19]: So I hate to disagree with you on this, but we were clear about parking then, and we're clear about it now.

547
01:09:03,617 --> 01:09:07,059
[SPEAKER_19]: We've got to have some parking or it will close for us.

548
01:09:10,940 --> 01:09:12,581
[SPEAKER_08]: Any further discussion on this item?

549
01:09:17,472 --> 01:09:19,533
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeing none, we'll move to general public participation.

550
01:09:19,553 --> 01:09:22,854
[SPEAKER_08]: Public participation on any topic not on the agenda.

551
01:09:25,495 --> 01:09:25,696
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

552
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:41,502
[SPEAKER_21]: Do you councilors remember City Councilor Mayorko, by any chance?

553
01:09:42,783 --> 01:09:43,863
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw him just the other day.

554
01:09:47,978 --> 01:09:48,658
[SPEAKER_21]: There's a few.

555
01:09:49,839 --> 01:09:53,281
[SPEAKER_21]: He made a statement once, and I'll never forget it.

556
01:09:53,302 --> 01:09:54,943
[SPEAKER_21]: It's the only time I agree with him.

557
01:09:56,283 --> 01:10:00,046
[SPEAKER_21]: He said, I quote, leave the people alone.

558
01:10:02,668 --> 01:10:16,757
[SPEAKER_21]: But no, you want two, perhaps two and a half, overrides in the ballot next week, which never, ever happened in this town, ever, never.

559
01:10:19,332 --> 01:10:27,802
[SPEAKER_21]: Some, a lot of taxpayers are having trouble paying bills with all this inflation in the past four years.

560
01:10:29,524 --> 01:10:32,948
[SPEAKER_21]: I have one question for all of you city councilors.

561
01:10:33,508 --> 01:10:39,255
[SPEAKER_21]: Do you have any ideas to lower our real estate tax at all?

562
01:10:39,575 --> 01:10:40,216
[SPEAKER_21]: I am listening.

563
01:10:44,972 --> 01:10:50,895
[SPEAKER_21]: And do you have another two minutes and then we'll go to the council, so the council does not have to answer me is that what you're trying to tell me, that is true.

564
01:10:51,175 --> 01:10:54,037
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you for your, for your input.

565
01:10:56,038 --> 01:11:02,321
[SPEAKER_21]: Or is it the tax the rich and feed the poor until they're on the original more, tell me where is sanity.

566
01:11:04,763 --> 01:11:05,623
[SPEAKER_21]: This can go on.

567
01:11:06,283 --> 01:11:07,064
[SPEAKER_21]: How much is enough.

568
01:11:07,861 --> 01:11:09,122
[SPEAKER_21]: Please stop the bleeding.

569
01:11:09,482 --> 01:11:13,624
[SPEAKER_21]: No further taxation without proper representation.

570
01:11:14,205 --> 01:11:14,925
[SPEAKER_21]: Andrew said that.

571
01:11:16,326 --> 01:11:18,948
[SPEAKER_21]: Again, leave the people alone.

572
01:11:19,348 --> 01:11:21,569
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. Miyako said that, this.

573
01:11:23,810 --> 01:11:24,211
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

574
01:11:28,273 --> 01:11:36,438
[SPEAKER_08]: Any further discussion or anyone who'd like to participate in public participation on any item that's not on the agenda for the rest of the evening?

575
01:11:39,881 --> 01:11:41,122
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeing none, is there a motion on the floor?

576
01:11:43,965 --> 01:11:45,226
[SPEAKER_08]: Vice President Collins.

577
01:11:46,607 --> 01:11:48,169
[SPEAKER_25]: To revert to the regular order of meeting.

578
01:11:48,789 --> 01:11:52,973
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion of Vice President Collins to revert to the regular order of business, seconded by Councilor Tseng.

579
01:11:53,033 --> 01:11:53,693
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

580
01:11:53,714 --> 01:11:54,154
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

581
01:11:54,614 --> 01:11:55,135
[SPEAKER_08]: Opposed?

582
01:11:55,235 --> 01:11:56,036
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion passes.

583
01:11:58,554 --> 01:12:26,796
[SPEAKER_08]: 24484, resolution to adopt local options of HERO Act, whereas Governor Healey recently signed into law an act honoring, empowering, and recognizing our service members and veterans, also known as the HERO Act, Chapter 178 of the Acts of 2024, to increase benefits, modernize services, and promote inclusivity for veterans in Massachusetts, and whereas the HERO Act allows local option in which cities may tie property tax exemptions and veteran-specific exemptions to the Consumer Price Index

584
01:12:27,436 --> 01:12:29,939
[SPEAKER_08]: allowing for automatic year-to-year increases in these exemptions.

585
01:12:30,679 --> 01:12:44,051
[SPEAKER_08]: Now therefore be it resolved by the Medford City Council that the City of Medford accept General Law, Chapter 59, Section 5, Clause 22i, which authorizes an annual increase in the amount of the exemption granted under General Law, Chapter 59, Section 5, Clause 22, 22a, 22b, 22c, 22e, and 22f,

586
01:12:50,317 --> 01:12:51,778
[SPEAKER_08]: by the percentage increase in the U.S.

587
01:12:51,798 --> 01:13:16,819
[SPEAKER_08]: Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index for the previous year as determined by the Department of Revenue to be effective for the applicable exemptions granted for any fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2025, and be it further resolved that the City of Medford accept the General Laws Chapter 59, Section 5, Clause 22J, which authorizes an annual increase in the amount of the exemption granted under General Laws Chapter 59, Section 5, Clauses 22,

588
01:13:20,237 --> 01:13:34,090
[SPEAKER_08]: 22A, 22B, 22C, 22E, and 22F by up to 100% of the personal exemption amount subject to the conditions in Clause 22J to be effective for applicable exemptions granted for any fiscal year beginning on or after July 1st, 2025.

589
01:13:34,690 --> 01:13:43,318
[SPEAKER_08]: And we do have attached here the memo from the Division of Local Services of the State Department of Revenue regarding the HERO Act.

590
01:13:45,147 --> 01:13:48,769
[SPEAKER_08]: and I believe Councilor Leming has also discussed this with the assessor.

591
01:13:49,289 --> 01:13:50,510
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll go to Councilor Leming.

592
01:13:50,530 --> 01:13:52,751
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Council President.

593
01:13:52,791 --> 01:14:07,117
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is pretty much a cut and dry resolution which would adopt the two parts of the HERO Act that City Councils explicitly need to approve.

594
01:14:07,257 --> 01:14:10,278
[SPEAKER_13]: I've talked to the Veteran Services Director and the assessor

595
01:14:11,559 --> 01:14:12,141
[SPEAKER_13]: about this.

596
01:14:12,161 --> 01:14:12,704
[SPEAKER_13]: So clause 22.

597
01:14:18,815 --> 01:14:33,839
[SPEAKER_13]: that would allow for the city to go up to the full amount of exemptions for veterans, although we already do that in other parts of general laws, chapter 59.

598
01:14:35,399 --> 01:14:42,181
[SPEAKER_13]: So it wouldn't necessarily add to that, but Ted tells me there's no harm in adopting it anyway, just for future purposes.

599
01:14:42,201 --> 01:14:43,922
[SPEAKER_13]: The real effect of that would be

600
01:14:44,382 --> 01:14:57,567
[SPEAKER_13]: The real important part here is clause 22 I, which would basically increase the amount of folks tax exemptions on a yearly basis according to increases in the consumer price index.

601
01:14:57,727 --> 01:15:06,910
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's another mechanism to make these kind of dollar amount exemptions automatic without a city council or the state having to come in and

602
01:15:10,211 --> 01:15:11,192
[SPEAKER_13]: do that explicitly.

603
01:15:11,252 --> 01:15:15,156
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's one of the new things that the HERO Act allows.

604
01:15:15,877 --> 01:15:24,985
[SPEAKER_13]: So I yeah, it's a you know, it's a fairly straightforward adoption of provisions of state law.

605
01:15:26,086 --> 01:15:31,151
[SPEAKER_13]: And I would motion to send this to legal for review.

606
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:39,703
[SPEAKER_13]: I talked it over with head he recommended to send it to legal for review first.

607
01:15:40,403 --> 01:15:49,709
[SPEAKER_08]: That was what he on the motion of Councilor lemming to refer this paper for legal review seconded by Councilor Kelly and is there any further discussion.

608
01:15:52,912 --> 01:15:53,252
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

609
01:15:53,612 --> 01:15:54,993
[SPEAKER_18]: I think a lot of this is reasonable.

610
01:15:55,013 --> 01:16:00,516
[SPEAKER_18]: I am helpful to the veterans living in our community.

611
01:16:01,276 --> 01:16:13,423
[SPEAKER_18]: I would just ask if Councilor Leming would also be okay asking for the financial department to give a little bit of input about this financial or assessing to give a little bit of

612
01:16:14,023 --> 01:16:26,877
[SPEAKER_18]: assessing to give a little bit of input about this as well, just to help us understand what this would look like for our residents in the next year, and what this looks like for non veteran residents as well.

613
01:16:29,420 --> 01:16:30,601
[SPEAKER_08]: Go to Councilor Scarpelli.

614
01:16:31,102 --> 01:16:31,482
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

615
01:16:31,522 --> 01:16:33,524
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, President Council, let me bring this forward.

616
01:16:34,070 --> 01:16:46,321
[SPEAKER_11]: Because this is the outside the box thinking that we need to protect that most vulnerable, especially when you talk about the times we're in today so I and I think that Council saying is correct I think that what might help some people that

617
01:16:46,946 --> 01:16:49,387
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, there are some people out there that'll question everything.

618
01:16:49,807 --> 01:17:04,992
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think the city assessor could really support us by showing how the tax levy is, how many, if we looked at how many veterans needed the support and what that would look like and who would carry the brunt.

619
01:17:05,012 --> 01:17:13,414
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think if you asked nine out of 10 residents that we can support our seniors, I mean, our veterans,

620
01:17:15,908 --> 01:17:25,910
[SPEAKER_11]: and helping them through this process, I think that it would be supported wholeheartedly, but I think it would be good just to see that number, because I don't think it'd be drastic.

621
01:17:26,230 --> 01:17:26,730
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you.

622
01:17:26,790 --> 01:17:26,950
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

623
01:17:28,351 --> 01:17:33,292
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll go back to Councilor Leming in just a second, but I was on some of the email chains and we can get that.

624
01:17:33,752 --> 01:17:37,933
[SPEAKER_08]: Ted has already said he doesn't expect it to be a significant impact on the overlay.

625
01:17:38,353 --> 01:17:42,794
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, but I'll go to Councilor Leming, he had more of the conversations than I did.

626
01:17:43,666 --> 01:17:43,986
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, sure.

627
01:17:44,207 --> 01:18:07,109
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, so this is, there's already, I mean, Ted's already seen the text of this and he approved everything, but I could add onto that motion just a request from the assessor for a memo, an additional memo to outline his approval for it in the public record if my colleagues think that that is appropriate.

628
01:18:09,462 --> 01:18:11,063
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you Councilor Megan.

629
01:18:11,103 --> 01:18:17,948
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I would note DLS literally gave us sample language here and that's the language we're using.

630
01:18:17,968 --> 01:18:23,372
[SPEAKER_08]: I personally don't think this needs to go to KP for however long they're going to take on it.

631
01:18:28,836 --> 01:18:29,096
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

632
01:18:29,657 --> 01:18:29,857
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

633
01:18:30,497 --> 01:18:35,301
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really written, but if we want to just get a letter from the assessor and then we can take it up in two weeks or something.

634
01:18:35,861 --> 01:18:37,863
[SPEAKER_08]: And if KP can get us something in two weeks,

635
01:18:39,292 --> 01:18:39,432
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

636
01:18:39,892 --> 01:18:40,152
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

637
01:18:41,553 --> 01:18:50,817
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that would mean that would be a motion to table till the next regular meeting and request a memo from the assessor and legal if they can provide one.

638
01:18:51,957 --> 01:18:52,157
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

639
01:18:52,937 --> 01:18:53,278
[SPEAKER_13]: Sounds good.

640
01:18:53,378 --> 01:18:53,738
[SPEAKER_13]: So moved.

641
01:18:57,919 --> 01:18:58,220
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

642
01:18:59,020 --> 01:19:04,562
[SPEAKER_08]: On that motion by Councilor Leming, seconded by Councilor Tseng, all those in favor.

643
01:19:05,823 --> 01:19:06,543
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed.

644
01:19:07,398 --> 01:19:12,302
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion passes and this is tabled to the next regular meeting pending those requests.

645
01:19:14,043 --> 01:19:19,007
[SPEAKER_08]: And Councilor Leming if you could just ping Ted, and maybe Nina for KP.

646
01:19:23,731 --> 01:19:25,272
[SPEAKER_08]: And the clerk can coordinate with you on that.

647
01:19:25,292 --> 01:19:28,314
[SPEAKER_08]: 24489 offered by Councilor Scarpelli.

648
01:19:32,947 --> 01:19:36,970
[SPEAKER_08]: Be it resolved, a resolution request information on review of fire department policies and procedures.

649
01:19:37,491 --> 01:19:46,558
[SPEAKER_08]: Be it resolved that the city council receive a copy of the final report and any additional preliminary information recently completed by the consultants that reviewed the Medford Fire Department policies and procedures.

650
01:19:47,279 --> 01:19:51,242
[SPEAKER_08]: Be it further resolved that Chief Evans and consultants attend the next council meeting to explain the findings.

651
01:19:51,762 --> 01:20:01,230
[SPEAKER_08]: Be it further resolved that the details in the consultant's report have any recommendations involving the designs of our fire headquarters and that its findings be immediately presented before the November 5th override vote.

652
01:20:01,290 --> 01:20:02,211
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Scarpelli.

653
01:20:08,905 --> 01:20:09,886
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr President.

654
01:20:10,726 --> 01:20:24,637
[SPEAKER_11]: I was informed that our, um, the consultant that this body approved its funding, um, has finished their assessment and has presented to the chief and his leadership team.

655
01:20:25,258 --> 01:20:38,488
[SPEAKER_11]: And one thing that I found, um, that really struck me is that back in September, um, maybe the fire, um, our partners from the method fight apartment can help us.

656
01:20:38,528 --> 01:20:38,648
[SPEAKER_11]: But

657
01:20:39,241 --> 01:20:52,348
[SPEAKER_11]: We had, I know the mayor spoke on a podcast that mentioned the consultant directly and stating some pretty damaging wordage.

658
01:20:52,849 --> 01:20:54,930
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would imagine that that letter

659
01:20:55,550 --> 01:21:07,737
[SPEAKER_11]: is public and is part of this body's purview to overview and use that input to help our residents, especially when they come up to Tuesday's meeting.

660
01:21:07,777 --> 01:21:18,924
[SPEAKER_11]: I know the Chief's here, and I know that President Marcellino's here from the Firefighters Union, and I know that, I believe the mayor used the consultant's words, she said,

661
01:21:19,484 --> 01:21:24,008
[SPEAKER_11]: If she didn't fix the culture dysfunction with the fire department that someone could get hurt.

662
01:21:24,428 --> 01:21:34,536
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's something she used to support her efforts, moving against anything to deal with the fire department but I think that that's something that is alarming to me when I heard it.

663
01:21:34,896 --> 01:21:35,357
[SPEAKER_11]: And now that

664
01:21:36,277 --> 01:21:38,258
[SPEAKER_11]: the consultant is completed.

665
01:21:38,338 --> 01:21:56,842
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the biggest issues that we're hearing right now and discrepancies that we're hearing from both the fire, um, firefighters themselves, the fire union who have come out publicly and chief Freeman, who was here the other day that spoke openly about the design of the fire station.

666
01:21:57,282 --> 01:21:57,422
[SPEAKER_11]: Now,

667
01:21:59,008 --> 01:22:01,409
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know how people want to look at the situation.

668
01:22:01,509 --> 01:22:03,270
[SPEAKER_11]: If it's one side or the other, I don't.

669
01:22:03,350 --> 01:22:10,374
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that there should be only one side, and that's what we need in our community for our fire station, the best design possible.

670
01:22:10,894 --> 01:22:18,898
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think that I would imagine that, and correct me if I'm wrong, maybe Chief Evans can come up, that the pot of that

671
01:22:19,631 --> 01:22:34,117
[SPEAKER_11]: discussion must have been around a new design of a headquarters and getting some information out to the public, whether it's a, I know we're very popular with press releases, but really sharing any information that's given through a

672
01:22:35,057 --> 01:22:36,157
[SPEAKER_11]: third party per se.

673
01:22:36,197 --> 01:22:45,481
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not the yes group, it's not the no group, it's a third party that's come into the city and done an evaluation that the mayor has requested that this council has paid for.

674
01:22:45,941 --> 01:22:50,283
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would hope that we can get that information out before the election on Tuesday.

675
01:22:50,303 --> 01:22:58,066
[SPEAKER_11]: I know a lot of people have already gone out and voted, but I think that understanding what a consultant might think of that design might play a huge factor.

676
01:22:58,086 --> 01:23:04,629
[SPEAKER_11]: Now again, if it's the fact that there isn't any information in those documents about

677
01:23:05,169 --> 01:23:10,016
[SPEAKER_11]: the design, then I stand corrected and we move forward.

678
01:23:10,036 --> 01:23:21,433
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think it would be interesting to see if that was part of that consultant's purview to share their opinion when it comes to our main street

679
01:23:21,973 --> 01:23:38,269
[SPEAKER_11]: fire department and it's designed for a new station because I know that a lot of people right now are in flux whether they're going to support it or not and if it's something that comes out and says no there are some design that he does support what the administration is saying that this is

680
01:23:38,949 --> 01:23:40,511
[SPEAKER_11]: All perfect and it's ready to go.

681
01:23:40,531 --> 01:23:51,399
[SPEAKER_11]: I know the chief supported it through the letter that the mayor read in her blog or her report that it's definitely that he supports the design.

682
01:23:51,820 --> 01:24:06,952
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think that having a party that is an outside specialist, I'd like to see if maybe the chief or anybody from the union has heard anything that can help us get that word out to the public.

683
01:24:07,692 --> 01:24:08,433
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

684
01:24:09,872 --> 01:24:10,372
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

685
01:24:10,392 --> 01:24:12,114
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll go to members of the council first.

686
01:24:13,075 --> 01:24:15,236
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyone would like to comment on the item?

687
01:24:18,079 --> 01:24:22,542
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeing none, Chief, if you would like to speak, you're more than welcome to.

688
01:24:23,283 --> 01:24:25,685
[SPEAKER_08]: It's your call, and then we can go to members of the public.

689
01:24:34,832 --> 01:24:35,152
[SPEAKER_09]: You're good.

690
01:24:35,473 --> 01:24:36,333
[SPEAKER_09]: Good.

691
01:24:36,393 --> 01:24:36,814
[SPEAKER_09]: Good evening.

692
01:24:38,535 --> 01:24:39,396
[SPEAKER_09]: What did you want to know about?

693
01:24:40,703 --> 01:24:43,205
[SPEAKER_09]: as far as the consultant.

694
01:24:44,506 --> 01:24:49,650
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe the request is for the report for the consultant to be released.

695
01:24:50,391 --> 01:25:05,582
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it could be released, especially with the election coming up in November about support or not supporting the fire design of the project, that if the consultant had information that we can share before the election day.

696
01:25:06,323 --> 01:25:09,245
[SPEAKER_09]: I would just clarify the vote is for the financing, not the final design.

697
01:25:10,524 --> 01:25:28,964
[SPEAKER_09]: So the consultant came out and spoke to all the deputy chiefs and the day personnel at the headquarters asking them about the overall well-being of the department and how we can strategize going forward and the consultant

698
01:25:29,636 --> 01:25:32,761
[SPEAKER_09]: consultant really wasn't discussing headquarters design.

699
01:25:33,483 --> 01:25:38,391
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's nothing in the design that consultants about their thought of the design?

700
01:25:38,732 --> 01:25:42,138
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably only if deputies were talking to them about their concerns about the

701
01:25:42,782 --> 01:25:44,304
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I don't know what I'm just saying.

702
01:25:44,324 --> 01:25:44,965
[SPEAKER_11]: If it's not, it's not.

703
01:25:44,985 --> 01:25:45,605
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just saying that.

704
01:25:46,026 --> 01:25:56,719
[SPEAKER_11]: So what I would do if we can, um, as well as, uh, appreciate that, that eliminates any, um, any, any thought process of trying to answer some questions.

705
01:25:56,739 --> 01:26:01,745
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think that if we can, Mr. President, that we do motion that we have, um,

706
01:26:02,385 --> 01:26:28,796
[SPEAKER_11]: if the consultant can come out later on after this as soon as we can to really review all of the findings with this council and if it needs to be to go to executive session that we go to an executive session because I know we as a council had some questions about having the fire department and talking with them about some concerns and maybe opening up executive session for them as well so I would put that in a form of a motion and hopefully we can do that

707
01:26:30,262 --> 01:26:32,111
[SPEAKER_11]: before before the new year if we can do that.

708
01:26:32,252 --> 01:26:32,694
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you.

709
01:26:33,447 --> 01:26:33,887
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks.

710
01:26:33,967 --> 01:26:36,929
[SPEAKER_08]: Is this an amendment to the resolution to request?

711
01:26:37,729 --> 01:26:41,031
[SPEAKER_08]: It says here right now, consultants attend the next city council meeting.

712
01:26:41,151 --> 01:26:44,093
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we want to change that to a future council meeting?

713
01:26:44,133 --> 01:26:57,140
[SPEAKER_11]: Now that the chief has answered that, that there's nothing in the report that, you know, I thought that that might be interesting to see if a third party had some initial thoughts on that in the report, but if they don't, that's fine.

714
01:26:57,160 --> 01:27:02,303
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's now we know if they don't, if we could just rephrase that, Mr. President, that we call for a

715
01:27:03,363 --> 01:27:31,768
[SPEAKER_11]: um a meeting uh before the new year it doesn't have to be right away now with the fire department and um the consultant to review their findings thank you got it so i would amend the resolution to um remove the question about the fire headquarters and then change it to requesting to attend a future council meeting to explain the findings perfect thank you mr president got it do you have that amendment mr clerk

716
01:27:32,921 --> 01:27:34,622
[SPEAKER_08]: Any further discussion by members of the council?

717
01:27:34,642 --> 01:27:38,145
[SPEAKER_08]: Vice President Collins.

718
01:27:38,165 --> 01:27:39,746
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

719
01:27:39,786 --> 01:27:40,567
[SPEAKER_25]: Nothing major for me.

720
01:27:40,587 --> 01:27:44,350
[SPEAKER_25]: I just want to thank the chief for spending some time with us tonight and for answering our questions.

721
01:27:46,592 --> 01:27:47,052
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

722
01:27:48,113 --> 01:27:49,634
[SPEAKER_08]: We can open it to public participation.

723
01:27:49,654 --> 01:27:52,757
[SPEAKER_08]: We can take people at the podium or on Zoom.

724
01:27:58,732 --> 01:28:08,807
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeing no hands on zoom and no one at the podium in the chamber on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli as amended by Councilor Scarpelli seconded by seconded by Councilor Callahan.

725
01:28:09,328 --> 01:28:10,008
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor.

726
01:28:10,029 --> 01:28:12,031
[SPEAKER_08]: Opposed motion passes.

727
01:28:15,662 --> 01:28:22,885
[SPEAKER_08]: 24490 offered by President bears and Vice President Collins amendment to the zoning ordinance mystic Avenue quarter district for full to the Community Development Board.

728
01:28:23,385 --> 01:28:31,008
[SPEAKER_08]: This memorandum contains draft text for the following proposed zoning changes, amend section 94 dash 2.1 division into districts page two.

729
01:28:31,821 --> 01:28:53,839
[SPEAKER_08]: Amend and section 94 dash 3.2 table of use regulations table a dimensional standards page three, and then section 94 dash 4.1 table of dimensional requirements table be page nine, amend section 94 dash 12.0 definitions page 10 and insert section 94 dash nine dot x mystic Avenue quarter district page 12.

730
01:28:55,260 --> 01:29:07,368
[SPEAKER_08]: And I will go to Vice President Collins in just a second but just to say, this has been discussed I think we've had 13 committee meetings on the zoning updates project and the planning and permitting committee meet in planning and permitting committee.

731
01:29:07,388 --> 01:29:15,533
[SPEAKER_08]: This was referred out last week, procedurally the next steps are that we would now refer to the Community Development Board, they will hold a public hearing.

732
01:29:16,533 --> 01:29:23,618
[SPEAKER_08]: then they will refer it back with amendments or without to the City Council where the City Council will hold a public hearing.

733
01:29:24,078 --> 01:29:28,100
[SPEAKER_08]: And at that public hearing, the City Council would vote to adopt finally.

734
01:29:28,140 --> 01:29:32,263
[SPEAKER_08]: So there are two more public hearings on this proposal and I will go to Vice President Collins.

735
01:29:34,500 --> 01:29:50,950
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, President bears, I won't go into this and, you know, granular detail because it's been discussed so much in committee and because the council will, because the community will have a couple additional public hearings to really dive into the details if they so choose at the Community Development Board meeting which I believe to scheduled

736
01:29:51,870 --> 01:29:58,116
[SPEAKER_25]: November 20 is the date that's been penciled in to review this zoning proposal before it comes back to the city council.

737
01:29:58,897 --> 01:30:09,968
[SPEAKER_25]: But just before I make the motion to refer to the Community Development Board which again is just procedurally the next step that we have to take before we consider taking a vote on any zoning change to our zoning ordinances.

738
01:30:12,450 --> 01:30:18,694
[SPEAKER_25]: As president bear said we've had many meetings on this district in the planning and permitting committee.

739
01:30:18,714 --> 01:30:26,259
[SPEAKER_25]: This is a really exciting juncture for me personally as one counselor because over so many years.

740
01:30:28,760 --> 01:30:32,561
[SPEAKER_25]: with people in Medford, you know, not just people in City Hall, but just folks out on the street.

741
01:30:33,461 --> 01:30:43,244
[SPEAKER_25]: It comes up so often, how much potential Mystic Ave has and how people look around and say, you know, what's here is really great, but we know this can be so much more.

742
01:30:43,304 --> 01:30:56,968
[SPEAKER_25]: We see a lot of flatland, we see some vacant buildings, we see some lots that seem underdeveloped, and people can see the potential there for things that it's interesting for residents to go to, lots that will be really interesting for developers to want to develop.

743
01:30:58,189 --> 01:31:09,208
[SPEAKER_25]: And in, you know, a lot of potential new commercial growth for our city which I know is really important to all of us and a really shared value for all of us to grow our commercial tax base though so that we can grow without.

744
01:31:10,672 --> 01:31:13,775
[SPEAKER_25]: having to levy all of that burden onto our residential tax base.

745
01:31:14,956 --> 01:31:31,750
[SPEAKER_25]: So with a lot of the goals, those goals in mind, and with the comprehensive plan, you know, guiding our beginning of this process, we took a look at this district, our zoning consultant was able to propose kind of a slate of sub districts that would make sense for different parts of this corridor.

746
01:31:31,790 --> 01:31:36,514
[SPEAKER_25]: Of course, this corridor is very heavily commercial, heavily commercial, heavily commercial industrial.

747
01:31:37,514 --> 01:31:38,975
[SPEAKER_25]: ended about some residential areas.

748
01:31:39,015 --> 01:32:03,244
[SPEAKER_25]: So we took a lot of care in discussing what parts of that corridor, the north side closer to Medford Square, what type of mixed use involving commercial but not explicitly commercial makes sense for that zone as you get down further south towards Somerville, towards some of the more residential areas, what makes sense there, what's going to be good for development, what will buffer those residential areas from the commercial development that we hope to see there.

749
01:32:03,324 --> 01:32:04,945
[SPEAKER_25]: So we took a lot of time with those questions

750
01:32:06,145 --> 01:32:14,127
[SPEAKER_25]: And I'm very proud of the collaboration and the updated proposed zoning map that's come out of that as well.

751
01:32:14,167 --> 01:32:28,930
[SPEAKER_25]: Of course, all those nitty gritties, the dimensional standards that inform what we're proposing that developers can develop there in each sub-district, depending on the conditions of the sub-district and other incentives that they may or may not take advantage of.

752
01:32:29,630 --> 01:32:30,190
[SPEAKER_25]: All that to say,

753
01:32:31,090 --> 01:32:47,599
[SPEAKER_25]: There's a lot of weeds for people to dig into and I really do recommend that folks watch the meetings of the planning and permitting committee where this was discussed, or attend the Community Development Board meeting on what I believe is going to be November 20, if you want to have an even closer look at some of those details.

754
01:32:48,820 --> 01:32:57,385
[SPEAKER_25]: But I do want to thank the committee for going through this process I think this is a really important part of the zoning overhaul that this council has been really working very hard

755
01:32:58,025 --> 01:33:15,532
[SPEAKER_25]: to make progress on for this entire term and the previous two councils including the one that I wasn't on yet was working really hard to do this zoning work so that the, the things that residents of the community and business owners of the community have been asking the city to move on for such a long time that we're, you know, starting to make some real progress.

756
01:33:16,612 --> 01:33:19,453
[SPEAKER_25]: So on that, I would motion to refer this to the Community Development Board.

757
01:33:20,501 --> 01:33:24,707
[SPEAKER_08]: on the motion to refer to community development by Vice President Collins seconded by Councilor Leming.

758
01:33:25,287 --> 01:33:27,730
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll have further discussion I'll go to Councilor Scarpelli.

759
01:33:29,893 --> 01:33:33,037
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Council Collins for leading our zoning team.

760
01:33:33,558 --> 01:33:34,279
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that this is

761
01:33:35,296 --> 01:33:36,718
[SPEAKER_11]: agreed 1000%.

762
01:33:37,219 --> 01:33:38,521
[SPEAKER_11]: We need to move it forward.

763
01:33:38,561 --> 01:33:50,920
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that we've been looking, looking into this for so many years but I just again, I bring forth the understanding that of course we've had a lot of meetings, we can see that there's been plenty of meetings but one of the things that

764
01:33:51,380 --> 01:33:59,566
[SPEAKER_11]: we made sure with the past council that we really made sure that we tried to incorporate the community.

765
01:33:59,646 --> 01:34:03,889
[SPEAKER_11]: Now you could say that we've had these meetings been open up to everybody and this is great.

766
01:34:04,409 --> 01:34:07,652
[SPEAKER_11]: That's not what we talked about when we started the RFP process back

767
01:34:08,192 --> 01:34:32,454
[SPEAKER_11]: back many many years ago the conversation really was and I hope there's still time to do this is bringing the meetings to those neighborhoods and getting the input from our citizenry and with a comprehensive plan together with all the departments together and getting the vision of what everybody wants to do and making sure that all of the needs are going to be met in that neighborhood

768
01:34:32,975 --> 01:34:40,111
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, I revert to the RFP that was written and the scope of work that it says.

769
01:34:41,081 --> 01:34:49,165
[SPEAKER_11]: public outreach the consultant will develop a public outreach strategy designed to inform the community stakeholders and the general public.

770
01:34:49,785 --> 01:35:03,011
[SPEAKER_11]: The strategy and design was brought up into the fact that what we were doing in Somerville as a department leader that really shined the light and made everybody feel like stakeholders

771
01:35:04,375 --> 01:35:13,739
[SPEAKER_11]: I remember these meetings specifically that we all understood and agreed that going into these meetings, sitting down as a team, looking to see what everybody wants in the community.

772
01:35:14,240 --> 01:35:16,341
[SPEAKER_11]: And we talked about my process.

773
01:35:16,741 --> 01:35:28,026
[SPEAKER_11]: We talked about how recreation played a process when we wanted to look at Union Square and how that process was derived and how it was built together with stakeholders at those meetings in their backyard.

774
01:35:28,426 --> 01:35:29,807
[SPEAKER_11]: I know we've had a thousand meetings.

775
01:35:30,307 --> 01:35:32,408
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that people have been informed.

776
01:35:32,828 --> 01:35:36,149
[SPEAKER_11]: but it's not what we asked for as a council a few years ago.

777
01:35:36,749 --> 01:35:38,330
[SPEAKER_11]: This is what part of the RFP was.

778
01:35:38,370 --> 01:35:46,092
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, I'll state the comment that was made in a meeting when we were deciding this and we were talking about this in March.

779
01:35:46,672 --> 01:35:54,775
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Scott Pelli said, he thinks the most important thing in the community's input is community-based meetings, meaning in that zoning community.

780
01:35:55,175 --> 01:35:59,837
[SPEAKER_11]: So again, this is something that I'm making up because I wanna be negative or I don't wanna do this.

781
01:36:01,657 --> 01:36:04,278
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm gonna move forward with it, because I think we need to move forward with it.

782
01:36:04,658 --> 01:36:07,519
[SPEAKER_11]: But in the same vein, we have the whole community.

783
01:36:07,539 --> 01:36:12,121
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been talking with the people from Salem Street, and they feel the same way.

784
01:36:12,921 --> 01:36:18,023
[SPEAKER_11]: No one's talked to them, no one sat with them in their backyard at the Roberts, like we did in Somerville.

785
01:36:18,043 --> 01:36:20,804
[SPEAKER_11]: We go right in their yard, go to the Roberts Elementary School.

786
01:36:21,084 --> 01:36:23,906
[SPEAKER_11]: You bring the neighbors there and say, okay, this is a proposal.

787
01:36:23,946 --> 01:36:26,987
[SPEAKER_11]: We're looking to redevelop part of Salem Street to 12 stories.

788
01:36:28,740 --> 01:36:32,851
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, if you ask the people on Salem Street today, no one was really informed.

789
01:36:32,891 --> 01:36:36,581
[SPEAKER_11]: No one really understood the process and no different what we're hearing on Mr Cav.

790
01:36:36,641 --> 01:36:37,483
[SPEAKER_11]: So again,

791
01:36:39,269 --> 01:36:40,390
[SPEAKER_11]: We know we need this.

792
01:36:40,750 --> 01:36:42,731
[SPEAKER_11]: We know we need the reform.

793
01:36:42,831 --> 01:36:44,212
[SPEAKER_11]: We've supported this from the get-go.

794
01:36:44,652 --> 01:36:57,518
[SPEAKER_11]: What we do need is the truth of what hasn't been done, and that's what was written in the RFP, to have community-based meetings to involve the areas that are being rezoned to get their input and make them feel like they're part of the process.

795
01:36:57,958 --> 01:37:03,761
[SPEAKER_11]: Not all of a sudden they come in and say, well, there's 12 stories coming up and we really weren't part of the process.

796
01:37:04,001 --> 01:37:05,482
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, no, we've had 36 meetings.

797
01:37:05,622 --> 01:37:06,503
[SPEAKER_11]: We know we've had 36 meetings.

798
01:37:07,643 --> 01:37:18,631
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'm telling you again, when we talk about surveys, and I'll use Carr Park as an example, when they did Carr Park over, we talked to Alicia saying that everybody was surveyed in the community.

799
01:37:19,411 --> 01:37:20,472
[SPEAKER_11]: I live a few streets away.

800
01:37:20,492 --> 01:37:21,253
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I wasn't.

801
01:37:21,333 --> 01:37:22,714
[SPEAKER_11]: If I asked my neighbors, no, they weren't.

802
01:37:23,034 --> 01:37:24,575
[SPEAKER_11]: And we're seeing the same thing as we go.

803
01:37:25,156 --> 01:37:26,036
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, this is the beginning.

804
01:37:26,897 --> 01:37:29,419
[SPEAKER_11]: So we could still catch this.

805
01:37:29,879 --> 01:37:32,421
[SPEAKER_11]: But all I implore to my council colleagues

806
01:37:33,413 --> 01:37:47,023
[SPEAKER_11]: to do what was asked in the RFP and I'll make a motion to revisit or ask for the plan that associates must have because it's part of the scope of work of what they viewed envisioned of what the

807
01:37:48,123 --> 01:37:51,946
[SPEAKER_11]: the community outreaches because to me, we're not reaching them.

808
01:37:52,427 --> 01:37:56,010
[SPEAKER_11]: So again, like I said, I'm going to support this because I think it needs to move forward.

809
01:37:56,030 --> 01:38:02,335
[SPEAKER_11]: But in the same vein, before it gets too into the process, we really need to start having these community meetings.

810
01:38:02,575 --> 01:38:08,260
[SPEAKER_11]: We really need to start informing our residents more about being part of this process.

811
01:38:08,280 --> 01:38:16,166
[SPEAKER_11]: So they're not shocked two years down the line when all of a sudden their neighborhood has changed so drastically that they can't live there anymore.

812
01:38:16,226 --> 01:38:17,167
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you, Mr President.

813
01:38:17,932 --> 01:38:18,372
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

814
01:38:18,573 --> 01:38:19,273
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to know.

815
01:38:20,074 --> 01:38:22,656
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think any proposal for 12 stories on Salem Street.

816
01:38:26,368 --> 01:38:30,009
[SPEAKER_08]: it's I think it's I know I just I know.

817
01:38:30,029 --> 01:38:31,089
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to put it out there.

818
01:38:31,489 --> 01:38:39,511
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, if anyone is thinking that that is not been discussed at all, um, it would be, I think, significantly out of scope.

819
01:38:40,351 --> 01:38:43,431
[SPEAKER_08]: I do have the innest proposal that we accepted here.

820
01:38:44,252 --> 01:38:47,752
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, and project deliverables number two meetings.

821
01:38:48,272 --> 01:38:50,533
[SPEAKER_08]: This phase includes the meetings throughout the process.

822
01:38:51,453 --> 01:38:51,573
[SPEAKER_08]: Um,

823
01:38:52,373 --> 01:38:56,756
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's meetings city staff monthly for the length of the project.

824
01:38:57,236 --> 01:39:06,662
[SPEAKER_08]: City Council 10 to 15 throughout the three phases updates the Community Development Board one in each phases one and 22 and phase three public workshops to.

825
01:39:07,637 --> 01:39:15,381
[SPEAKER_08]: steering committee, six to eight stakeholder interviews, 12 to 15, four to five per phasers targeted to phases one and three.

826
01:39:16,082 --> 01:39:19,404
[SPEAKER_08]: So that is what the proposal was.

827
01:39:19,984 --> 01:39:24,867
[SPEAKER_08]: And I do know that NS Associates and planning department have done a lot of

828
01:39:25,527 --> 01:39:29,389
[SPEAKER_08]: one to one discussions with folks in different neighborhoods.

829
01:39:30,669 --> 01:39:45,475
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think something that we've discussed, as we discussed in the committee meeting last week, is trying to just be more clear and direct and use more of the city resources that are available to say, and our goal is to do this a month in advance.

830
01:39:46,055 --> 01:40:01,462
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's the meeting at which we will be talking about this specific area, and to try to use the city resources of the robocall system, as well as the different newsletters and digital outreach to inform people in each neighborhood, an area about that.

831
01:40:03,690 --> 01:40:09,774
[SPEAKER_08]: the limited technological capability of us to hold public meetings in a hybrid fashion anywhere except for this room.

832
01:40:10,955 --> 01:40:27,125
[SPEAKER_08]: That has been a limiting factor, but we do want to get that out there in advance of each specific area of discussion so that folks can say, I live in this neighborhood, here's the meeting about my neighborhood, I can voice my input at that meeting.

833
01:40:34,830 --> 01:40:42,912
[SPEAKER_11]: for myself so I can share this with the community is what that breakdown really means for the community input one on ones.

834
01:40:43,592 --> 01:40:45,832
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, I think that that would be important to Mr President.

835
01:40:45,852 --> 01:40:53,934
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that, um, I don't think it will be a concern or an issue or a violation to bring the meetings into neighborhoods.

836
01:40:54,274 --> 01:40:56,294
[SPEAKER_11]: We've done this in the past many, many times.

837
01:40:56,354 --> 01:40:58,955
[SPEAKER_11]: So, um, I think that that that

838
01:40:59,881 --> 01:41:01,382
[SPEAKER_11]: that wouldn't be a hindrance at all.

839
01:41:01,802 --> 01:41:13,868
[SPEAKER_11]: But I appreciate the words, but again, I do think that we should do more, like you said, and maybe outreaching and doing something in their communities, in those neighborhoods.

840
01:41:13,908 --> 01:41:14,388
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you.

841
01:41:15,108 --> 01:41:15,488
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

842
01:41:15,528 --> 01:41:16,529
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll go to Councilor Tseng.

843
01:41:18,643 --> 01:41:19,344
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you so much.

844
01:41:20,004 --> 01:41:28,311
[SPEAKER_18]: I really want to thank NS Associates, our city planning department, and our planning committee for all the hard work that they've done on this.

845
01:41:28,331 --> 01:41:34,916
[SPEAKER_18]: I've sat in on a few meetings and I've also been paying attention to this process really rigorously.

846
01:41:35,857 --> 01:41:44,864
[SPEAKER_18]: As I've said at many council meetings in the past, and I think it's not, I can't claim credit for inventing this saying, but Mystic Ave is the gateway to Medford.

847
01:41:46,926 --> 01:41:54,248
[SPEAKER_18]: As we have two exits that basically one exit opening up directly to Mystic Ave and another one very easily accessible to Mystic Ave.

848
01:41:55,249 --> 01:42:05,872
[SPEAKER_18]: For so many of our residents and so many visitors to Medford, Mystic Ave is the first thing that they see when they're driving through the city, when they're coming home from work, when they're leaving for work.

849
01:42:06,474 --> 01:42:11,357
[SPEAKER_18]: We want to make sure that that corridor is as livable as vibrant and as walkable as possible.

850
01:42:12,098 --> 01:42:17,802
[SPEAKER_18]: And we hear this from our residents as I'm counselor Collins mentioned in her spiel.

851
01:42:18,362 --> 01:42:22,385
[SPEAKER_18]: This is something that we hear a lot in our door knocking, when we run for office.

852
01:42:22,745 --> 01:42:27,068
[SPEAKER_18]: This is something that the city has held countless meetings on in the past.

853
01:42:27,928 --> 01:42:39,119
[SPEAKER_18]: This is something that's highlighted directly in our comprehensive plan which reached out directly to tens of thousands of residents and received responses from thousands of our residents as well.

854
01:42:40,060 --> 01:42:41,241
[SPEAKER_18]: There's been tons of debates.

855
01:42:42,522 --> 01:42:49,669
[SPEAKER_18]: For anyone who's lived in Medford for a while we know that this corridor has been subject to particularly heated conversation.

856
01:42:51,169 --> 01:42:55,530
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think there's been consensus building around a vision for this corridor.

857
01:42:55,590 --> 01:43:13,014
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think the community has really come around a vision for this corridor that's more vibrant, that really helps us generate business growth in this city, generate housing growth in this city, and generate revenue for our much-needed city services.

858
01:43:13,674 --> 01:43:18,335
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it's really important to note, as the Council President has and as

859
01:43:18,915 --> 01:43:22,237
[SPEAKER_18]: Vice President Collins has, this is the beginning of the next stage in the process.

860
01:43:23,338 --> 01:43:39,566
[SPEAKER_18]: And in my opinion, it's much easier to solicit feedback, much easier for residents to give feedback on a project that has already been laid out, that has more concrete details that has language that people can look at, instead of things that are just more conceptual.

861
01:43:40,006 --> 01:43:40,507
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think

862
01:43:41,504 --> 01:43:52,093
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm very grateful for this month's time that we have to engage our community about this process before the CDB meeting about this.

863
01:43:52,993 --> 01:44:04,382
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's just one of the, you know, one of the meetings I hope, and I know, where residents can give their feedback about the plan that this council is sending to the CDB.

864
01:44:05,783 --> 01:44:23,369
[SPEAKER_18]: I know the resident services committee has instituted more public participation and more public engagement on mechanisms and in the past, and I know, you know, we're still figuring a lot of stuff out but I'd hope that we can look at those mechanisms as ways to engage our community as well.

865
01:44:24,669 --> 01:44:27,330
[SPEAKER_18]: Again, I this is something that I'm enthusiastic about.

866
01:44:27,350 --> 01:44:48,636
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that this is a real solid plan that ties directly in to what we all know our best practices for business growth for commercial growth for engaging the citizenry of our city and in direct plans to lower housing costs on the most economically measurable plans to lower housing costs for residents.

867
01:44:49,096 --> 01:45:03,588
[SPEAKER_18]: So, you know, is this plan perfect, I'm sure we'll hear a lot of feedback about it through the processes, but does this plan deserve to move on I think our residents are very ready to see some real action, instead of just you know all the conversation we've had.

868
01:45:03,748 --> 01:45:08,211
[SPEAKER_18]: And so, you know, I think conversation has to happen I think it has to happen in conjunction with action.

869
01:45:08,311 --> 01:45:10,893
[SPEAKER_18]: So again, I'm very enthusiastic about this.

870
01:45:12,475 --> 01:45:12,755
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

871
01:45:14,721 --> 01:45:15,162
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

872
01:45:15,462 --> 01:45:29,360
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, when we talk about increasing property taxes and our prep two and a half override questions we also discuss new growth frequently because that's another mechanism for increasing revenue to the city.

873
01:45:31,182 --> 01:45:41,747
[SPEAKER_03]: this will be a wonderful opportunity to increase revenue coming into Medford without asking our residents to pay more.

874
01:45:42,628 --> 01:45:48,070
[SPEAKER_03]: That will contribute to the services that we can provide our residents, and this is the way we do it.

875
01:45:48,531 --> 01:45:55,154
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so grateful to Vice President Collins and the rest of the Planning and Permitting Committee for all of their work.

876
01:45:55,194 --> 01:45:55,534
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been

877
01:45:56,121 --> 01:46:05,556
[SPEAKER_03]: watching the meetings lately, and it's just taken a ton of commitment and a lot of very careful, thoughtful planning and design.

878
01:46:06,983 --> 01:46:10,587
[SPEAKER_03]: and a lot of great collaboration with Innis Associates.

879
01:46:10,627 --> 01:46:13,430
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm looking forward to seeing where we go with this.

880
01:46:14,571 --> 01:46:28,826
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is new growth on Mystic Ebb has the potential to pay for things like keeping the library open on Sundays, like smaller projects that we couldn't possibly justify with larger things like an override because they're, you know,

881
01:46:29,861 --> 01:46:31,723
[SPEAKER_03]: that we can't afford to pay for.

882
01:46:31,743 --> 01:46:32,684
[SPEAKER_03]: Um uh, things that are too too.

883
01:46:32,764 --> 01:46:35,387
[SPEAKER_03]: There are too many things we need to pay for that we can't afford yet.

884
01:46:35,527 --> 01:46:43,515
[SPEAKER_03]: And the way that we bring in that revenue without asking our residents to scrimp and save and give us more is by giving our

885
01:46:49,621 --> 01:46:52,504
[SPEAKER_03]: we want to be able to provide the services that our residents need.

886
01:46:53,745 --> 01:47:03,673
[SPEAKER_03]: I also did just want to address briefly that I know that our City Hall employees are attempting in many ways to address a lot of the

887
01:47:05,558 --> 01:47:10,321
[SPEAKER_03]: public feedback that they do need for things like car park.

888
01:47:10,441 --> 01:47:11,982
[SPEAKER_03]: I work out in car park a lot.

889
01:47:12,422 --> 01:47:14,664
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't live near car park, but a lot of my friends do.

890
01:47:15,404 --> 01:47:24,991
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was approached by a city hall employee in car park when I was exercising once to ask me to weigh in on phase two of car park.

891
01:47:25,011 --> 01:47:25,891
[SPEAKER_03]: What do I need to see?

892
01:47:25,911 --> 01:47:30,554
[SPEAKER_03]: I did an online form that I was given, like, what do you want in car park?

893
01:47:30,634 --> 01:47:34,397
[SPEAKER_03]: And there were, there was, I experienced some outreach about that.

894
01:47:35,512 --> 01:47:47,596
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard to reach everybody, but I think that there are a lot of avenues that City Hall employees in the planning department are attempting to achieve and we appreciate it.

895
01:47:47,636 --> 01:47:51,897
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know it can be tough, but it's, they're doing it, they're trying.

896
01:47:51,917 --> 01:47:53,518
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you.

897
01:47:53,658 --> 01:47:56,239
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Lazzaro, Councilor Kellyanne.

898
01:48:05,182 --> 01:48:05,403
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

899
01:48:05,423 --> 01:48:08,971
[SPEAKER_04]: So on page 22 of 39, I just have one question, which is that.

900
01:48:13,809 --> 01:48:15,531
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just want to make sure there's not a typo in here.

901
01:48:16,131 --> 01:48:26,281
[SPEAKER_04]: I really remembered, and tell me if I'm misremembering, that the height, the building height differential between MX-1, MX-2, and MX-3 was more gradual.

902
01:48:26,942 --> 01:48:29,504
[SPEAKER_04]: These MX-1 numbers and MX-2 numbers are identical.

903
01:48:29,604 --> 01:48:32,347
[SPEAKER_04]: And I really thought that it stepped up between MX-1 and MX-2.

904
01:48:33,348 --> 01:48:34,409
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that not accurate, page 22 of 39?

905
01:48:41,872 --> 01:48:44,233
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yep, 22 of 39 of the packet.

906
01:48:46,053 --> 01:48:52,555
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought there was a step up between MX1 and MX2 and not like they're identical and there's a giant leap to MX3 in terms of height.

907
01:49:00,537 --> 01:49:01,377
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a good point.

908
01:49:02,557 --> 01:49:03,677
[SPEAKER_08]: That may be a typo.

909
01:49:08,188 --> 01:49:17,474
[SPEAKER_08]: We should just note that for Innis and the planning department as it moves through planning development, community development board, they can correct that and send it back to us amended.

910
01:49:27,487 --> 01:49:38,733
[SPEAKER_04]: And if I may, I also noticed that co living is explicitly denied in MX one, two and three, which is probably fine, because I'm guessing that those are all going to be one and two bedroom places that are built there.

911
01:49:45,736 --> 01:49:46,417
[SPEAKER_04]: But just a note.

912
01:49:47,057 --> 01:49:48,878
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and I will note, basically,

913
01:49:49,887 --> 01:49:51,347
[SPEAKER_08]: We haven't won one of these districts before.

914
01:49:51,387 --> 01:49:57,948
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think as a council, this council, Community Development Board will refer back an amended proposal to us.

915
01:49:58,388 --> 01:50:00,569
[SPEAKER_08]: We could then make amendments at the public hearing.

916
01:50:01,869 --> 01:50:06,870
[SPEAKER_08]: If we feel we can either, we don't have to accept all the Community Development Board amendments, we can make additional amendments.

917
01:50:07,870 --> 01:50:17,532
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just trying to look at the map from our last meeting, but I'll go to Councilor Collins, if you're finished.

918
01:50:19,235 --> 01:50:20,035
[SPEAKER_08]: Vice President Collins.

919
01:50:20,716 --> 01:50:20,916
[SPEAKER_25]: Great.

920
01:50:21,276 --> 01:50:31,341
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you for flagging those Councilor Callahan I know that for, for myself even having spent a lot of time with these documents, it is a lot of material, so thank you for the close read.

921
01:50:32,802 --> 01:50:39,705
[SPEAKER_25]: I just wanted to note and again this doesn't pertain to the motion that we're making tonight which is just to send this along to the next body which is, you know,

922
01:50:40,645 --> 01:50:47,008
[SPEAKER_25]: The, the board members who will again look through this for a fine tooth comb but just on the, on the community engagement piece.

923
01:50:47,408 --> 01:50:52,170
[SPEAKER_25]: I just didn't want to speak to that again, quickly, just to note that I think, I think it's really important.

924
01:50:52,990 --> 01:50:55,731
[SPEAKER_25]: And when I speak to what we're what we're doing and what we've done.

925
01:50:55,751 --> 01:51:05,215
[SPEAKER_25]: And that's on any topic not just the zoning it's it's not because I'm trying to make the point that, you know, we're doing a B and C so you know we got a 100%.

926
01:51:06,295 --> 01:51:08,656
[SPEAKER_25]: and we're perfect and we shouldn't do anything more.

927
01:51:08,676 --> 01:51:30,126
[SPEAKER_25]: I think as public servants we always aspire to, you know, in our fantasy version of our jobs we would talk to every single person and of course we can't do that, but I think it's really important that we always aspire to be catching more people, to be going into these projects with the assumption that everybody might have an opinion and if they do then it should be heard.

928
01:51:31,753 --> 01:51:45,457
[SPEAKER_25]: I think what is, you know, it is genuinely challenging and this project and many others is that we take that ideal that responsibility to incorporate as much public feedback as we possibly can.

929
01:51:45,477 --> 01:51:54,560
[SPEAKER_25]: And we have to reconcile that with what we can do and what we can say to residents that we are doing so that we're consistent, and so that they have

930
01:51:55,100 --> 01:51:58,583
[SPEAKER_25]: realistic expectations about where to find us and how we'll find them.

931
01:51:59,124 --> 01:52:14,137
[SPEAKER_25]: So when I say you know I think after the last meeting we had some conversations with the zoning consultant to say, Okay, we've gone through, you know, kind of one and a half zoning packages now we have this proposal we have the proposal of kind of more technical tweaks that we put forward around the end of the fiscal year.

932
01:52:14,997 --> 01:52:16,078
[SPEAKER_25]: Now we're kind of in our groove.

933
01:52:17,219 --> 01:52:31,489
[SPEAKER_25]: You know it's really time to bolster this what what more can we do so that it is so that it is as it should be easier for folks to get involved easier for more people to know what's coming up further ahead of time because that's really important, that is really important.

934
01:52:34,184 --> 01:52:55,029
[SPEAKER_25]: And to me, you know what it says, when it comes to, you know, the one proposal to what's ahead of time let's make a schedule for what we're talking about in which month, so that we know so that the city staff knows so that residents can know essentially kind of have this more save the date type format, so that folks can know and really prepare and say okay I have that date in my mind if I want to attend.

935
01:52:55,569 --> 01:53:02,971
[SPEAKER_25]: I'll be sure to attend, which is not to say that that's the perfect forum for feedback or that it should be the only forum.

936
01:53:04,233 --> 01:53:04,876
[SPEAKER_25]: Knowing that.

937
01:53:07,506 --> 01:53:16,728
[SPEAKER_25]: We are a city council in a city that does not yet have the resources for robust public engagement that we want to model ourselves off of that other neighboring communities do.

938
01:53:18,108 --> 01:53:26,010
[SPEAKER_25]: I think that gives us the opportunity to at least be expanding our reach by being able to say ahead of time, here's the meeting on this topic.

939
01:53:26,390 --> 01:53:28,250
[SPEAKER_25]: If it's relevant to you, please save the date.

940
01:53:28,871 --> 01:53:32,611
[SPEAKER_25]: If this format isn't doable for you, you have at least a month to let us know.

941
01:53:33,152 --> 01:53:34,352
[SPEAKER_25]: If you can't get to this meeting,

942
01:53:35,732 --> 01:53:39,735
[SPEAKER_25]: Let us know send us an email call us if you're a person who has to be engaged in your community.

943
01:53:40,376 --> 01:53:43,758
[SPEAKER_25]: Let us know so that we can find a way to accommodate and come to you.

944
01:53:43,778 --> 01:53:55,707
[SPEAKER_25]: What I'm trying to say is, I know that in the scope of this project with so much to cover it might not be, we might not be able to do what I think we all want to do, which is to have multiple community meetings in every neighborhood for every topic.

945
01:53:56,828 --> 01:54:02,453
[SPEAKER_25]: We can aspire to that I hope that we can do that especially in some of our more residential neighborhoods, where a lot of care has to be taken.

946
01:54:03,493 --> 01:54:12,920
[SPEAKER_25]: But especially to me as committee chair it is very important that we are able to tell people what to expect and that do that consistently because I think that is really important for access as well.

947
01:54:13,401 --> 01:54:14,782
[SPEAKER_25]: So just to note that for going forward.

948
01:54:15,342 --> 01:54:23,789
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm excited about the, you know, expanded messaging that we're going to be doing as we head into the new year.

949
01:54:25,049 --> 01:54:36,255
[SPEAKER_25]: And just to reiterate that, you know, we're, I'm really grateful to be guided by so many plans that were created in collaboration with the community over the course of years that lay the foundation for everything that we're doing.

950
01:54:36,935 --> 01:54:45,159
[SPEAKER_25]: And that, you know, it shouldn't go without saying that having the community involved in this process is really important.

951
01:54:45,219 --> 01:54:50,202
[SPEAKER_25]: And I think as public servants, we're always trying to think about realistically how to do that better and better every year.

952
01:54:50,382 --> 01:54:50,582
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

953
01:54:51,980 --> 01:54:52,441
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

954
01:54:52,461 --> 01:55:00,111
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and I'd note that question resource I know someone who was just hired as the communications director for the parking department in Cambridge.

955
01:55:00,892 --> 01:55:08,483
[SPEAKER_08]: So, it's not to communication search for the city it's like one person per department which is wild level of resources that I would

956
01:55:09,560 --> 01:55:17,446
[SPEAKER_08]: love to see the city have just one note, the difference between MX one and MX two is the step backs.

957
01:55:18,047 --> 01:55:20,309
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's why there would be a change in the massing.

958
01:55:21,209 --> 01:55:22,170
[SPEAKER_08]: I was just looking at the map.

959
01:55:22,190 --> 01:55:23,471
[SPEAKER_08]: That was a helpful reference point.

960
01:55:23,911 --> 01:55:33,919
[SPEAKER_08]: It is still maximum six in the MX two, but the step back is different versus the MX one on the motion of vice president Collins, seconded by council.

961
01:55:33,939 --> 01:55:37,102
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me to refer this amendment to the community development board.

962
01:55:37,162 --> 01:55:38,263
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there any further discussion?

963
01:55:40,737 --> 01:55:43,198
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeing none, is there any discussion by members of the public?

964
01:55:43,318 --> 01:55:47,379
[SPEAKER_08]: You can raise your hand on Zoom or come to the podium in the chamber.

965
01:55:50,699 --> 01:55:52,780
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll go to Melanie Tringali.

966
01:55:52,980 --> 01:55:54,440
[SPEAKER_08]: You have three minutes.

967
01:55:54,580 --> 01:55:56,260
[SPEAKER_08]: Name and address for the record, please.

968
01:55:57,801 --> 01:56:00,021
[SPEAKER_27]: Melanie Tringali, 1164 Street.

969
01:56:01,422 --> 01:56:04,002
[SPEAKER_27]: I just have a question as I'm looking through this document.

970
01:56:05,202 --> 01:56:06,923
[SPEAKER_27]: I noticed that you have,

971
01:56:08,041 --> 01:56:33,154
[SPEAKER_27]: mix one, mix two, mix three, and then through all the columns you have either, yeah, like an N, which I assume stand for no, Y for yes, and then the CDB, is that because you're sending it to them to make a recommendation for that, or is that because when one of those particular parcels come up for development, it needs to go to the Community Development Board?

972
01:56:33,174 --> 01:56:36,676
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be the question.

973
01:56:37,503 --> 01:56:48,151
[SPEAKER_27]: Dormitory and fraternity and sorority houses can be built on Mystic Ave, which I'm not quite sure how that contributes to our tax base, but then you have senior housing facilities, CDB.

974
01:56:51,614 --> 01:56:55,977
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, a lot of those are based on the existing use table.

975
01:56:57,038 --> 01:57:00,741
[SPEAKER_08]: CDB means Special Permit Granting Authority is the Community Development Board.

976
01:57:02,406 --> 01:57:13,536
[SPEAKER_08]: One thing that we're planning to do at the end of the project is realign the use table and take a second look at the special permitting, special permit granting authority for the uses.

977
01:57:14,677 --> 01:57:26,608
[SPEAKER_08]: But most of this, basically anything that's not a new use, which I think is highlighted in bold, is essentially following the special permit currently in the use table.

978
01:57:27,128 --> 01:57:53,159
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay so everything in bold would be a new use and then so then previously dormitory fraternity sorority was part of the old use and that's why it's still wide but okay all right exactly yeah okay that makes a little bit more sense to me thank you thank you all right on the motion to refer to community development board um do you think we should roll call

979
01:57:54,121 --> 01:57:55,002
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it has to be a roll call.

980
01:57:55,122 --> 01:57:58,845
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, on the motion by Councilor Collins seconded by Councilor Leming.

981
01:57:58,865 --> 01:57:59,746
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

982
01:58:01,148 --> 01:58:12,098
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Callahan, Vice President Collins, Councilor Lazzaro, Councilor Leming, Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Tseng, President Bears.

983
01:58:12,318 --> 01:58:12,618
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

984
01:58:13,019 --> 01:58:14,861
[SPEAKER_08]: Seven the affirmative, none the negative.

985
01:58:14,881 --> 01:58:16,222
[SPEAKER_08]: This is referred to community vote.

986
01:58:21,291 --> 01:58:33,902
[SPEAKER_08]: Communications from the mayor 24485 dear to the honorable president members of the city council regarding proposed way to just for the parking union I respect the request and recommend the city council approve the following amendments to the revised ordinances chapter 66 article two.

987
01:58:36,338 --> 01:58:51,130
[SPEAKER_08]: parking effective July 1 2022 increased base salary of all parking union union titles by 2.25% effective July 1 2023 2.5% effective July 1 2024 3% effective July 1 2025 2.5% effective July 1 2026 2.5% human resources director Lisa Crowley is available to answer any questions thank you for your kind attention to this matter respectfully submitted Mayor Brianna Lungo-Koehn.

988
01:59:05,416 --> 01:59:10,340
[SPEAKER_08]: I will go to Vice President Collins and then Director Crowley.

989
01:59:10,360 --> 01:59:14,103
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm happy to defer to Director Crowley if she would like to present first.

990
01:59:14,123 --> 01:59:17,125
[SPEAKER_08]: I think she's available for questions.

991
01:59:17,145 --> 01:59:18,827
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we have any questions for Director Crowley?

992
01:59:22,269 --> 01:59:25,472
[SPEAKER_08]: I have one or Councilor Callahan looks like we have one there.

993
01:59:26,807 --> 01:59:27,107
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

994
01:59:27,467 --> 01:59:28,988
[SPEAKER_04]: I just have three questions.

995
01:59:30,208 --> 01:59:36,109
[SPEAKER_04]: My first question is at these times in the past, did they have other cost of living adjustments or raises?

996
01:59:36,649 --> 01:59:37,510
[SPEAKER_04]: Or are these the only ones?

997
01:59:39,270 --> 01:59:43,451
[SPEAKER_04]: And my second question is just about parking union titles.

998
01:59:43,671 --> 01:59:45,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Does this include everyone in the department?

999
01:59:45,752 --> 01:59:51,453
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to understand what parking union titles means, and I understand that it's part of contract negotiations.

1000
01:59:55,914 --> 02:00:02,696
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, my third question is a little more broad, probably not really able to be answered.

1001
02:00:04,957 --> 02:00:16,480
[SPEAKER_04]: So I assume that the reason that we're looking only at raising parking right now is because of union negotiations rather than raising salaries of other unions.

1002
02:00:16,500 --> 02:00:20,681
[SPEAKER_08]: I think this probably reflects a recently negotiated collective bargaining agreement.

1003
02:00:22,082 --> 02:00:23,062
[SPEAKER_08]: Go to Director Crowley.

1004
02:00:25,235 --> 02:00:27,958
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, president bears and console.

1005
02:00:28,118 --> 02:00:32,602
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes, so the reason why we are only on partners.

1006
02:00:32,622 --> 02:00:34,965
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes, this is a new contract that we've negotiated.

1007
02:00:36,021 --> 02:00:41,245
[SPEAKER_23]: We've already negotiated out five other unions, and we have a few left to go.

1008
02:00:41,265 --> 02:00:44,608
[SPEAKER_23]: I think one of your questions were the titles.

1009
02:00:45,128 --> 02:00:48,111
[SPEAKER_23]: This is the entire department except the department head.

1010
02:00:48,671 --> 02:00:53,475
[SPEAKER_23]: So it would be the parking clerks, the lead parking meeting repairman.

1011
02:00:54,436 --> 02:01:01,242
[SPEAKER_23]: It would also include the parking meter repairman and the parking control specialist.

1012
02:01:01,282 --> 02:01:05,165
[SPEAKER_23]: So that would be every member in the department except the department head.

1013
02:01:08,032 --> 02:01:09,553
[SPEAKER_23]: And this is a new union.

1014
02:01:10,054 --> 02:01:15,058
[SPEAKER_23]: They just formed in 2022, which is why the contract goes back to 2022.

1015
02:01:15,139 --> 02:01:18,982
[SPEAKER_23]: There have been no other raises for this group.

1016
02:01:19,983 --> 02:01:22,125
[SPEAKER_23]: So this is why we have the six-year contract.

1017
02:01:26,849 --> 02:01:27,169
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1018
02:01:27,249 --> 02:01:28,951
[SPEAKER_08]: And what's the expiration date of the contract?

1019
02:01:30,132 --> 02:01:31,113
[SPEAKER_23]: I believe it's June 30, 2027.

1020
02:01:31,193 --> 02:01:31,393
[SPEAKER_23]: Got it.

1021
02:01:35,458 --> 02:01:37,479
[SPEAKER_08]: Go to Vice President Collins.

1022
02:01:39,120 --> 02:01:42,882
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you for being present, Director Crowley, and for answering our questions.

1023
02:01:43,622 --> 02:01:51,367
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm always happy to see a contract get resolved and always happy for the opportunity to approve and to waive the second and third readings.

1024
02:01:52,928 --> 02:02:00,412
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion of Vice President Collins to approve this paper and waive the three readings so that it's approved tonight,

1025
02:02:02,115 --> 02:02:04,018
[SPEAKER_08]: and that means that it can get processed faster.

1026
02:02:04,038 --> 02:02:06,642
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't have to wait for advertising and then wait another month.

1027
02:02:08,004 --> 02:02:10,627
[SPEAKER_08]: Any further discussion by members of the council?

1028
02:02:14,373 --> 02:02:17,698
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeing none, Director Crowley, is there anything else you'd like to add?

1029
02:02:19,196 --> 02:02:23,638
[SPEAKER_23]: No, I just appreciate your time for letting me answer your questions.

1030
02:02:24,679 --> 02:02:31,442
[SPEAKER_23]: And as soon as it's been approved, if you do wave the three reads, we'll get right on working on these contract retros.

1031
02:02:32,643 --> 02:02:33,363
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much.

1032
02:02:33,383 --> 02:02:38,545
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, on the motion of Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Tseng Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1033
02:02:39,026 --> 02:02:39,646
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Callahan.

1034
02:02:40,906 --> 02:02:41,707
[SPEAKER_14]: Vice President Collins.

1035
02:02:42,887 --> 02:02:43,808
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Lazzaro.

1036
02:02:45,569 --> 02:02:46,089

1068
02:05:07,664 --> 02:05:14,048
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll go to Maisha now, if there's anything you'd like to add.

1069
02:05:14,128 --> 02:05:15,550
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing to add here.

1070
02:05:15,570 --> 02:05:18,452
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm happy I'm in good company with solar and Tufts.

1071
02:05:18,812 --> 02:05:23,916
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm really excited for this opportunity and to give back to this community that I've been a part of for a couple of years now.

1072
02:05:26,869 --> 02:05:27,409
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much.

[SPEAKER_08]: So we will move to, is there a motion on the floor?

1076
02:05:37,536 --> 02:05:44,540
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion by Councilor Scarpelli to approve, seconded by Councilor Tseng, even though Councilor Collins used the request.

1077
02:05:45,461 --> 02:05:48,342
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'll go to Councilor Collins if there's anything you'd like to add.

1078
02:05:49,983 --> 02:05:51,004
[SPEAKER_25]: I'll motion to approve.

1079
02:05:51,264 --> 02:05:51,584
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1080
02:05:52,955 --> 02:05:59,037
[SPEAKER_08]: Seems like we're all in agreement here on the motion by counselors are probably seconded by Vice President Collins.

1081
02:05:59,898 --> 02:06:01,038
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Clark, all those in favor.

1082
02:06:01,798 --> 02:06:02,799
[SPEAKER_08]: Opposed motion passes.

1083
02:06:04,179 --> 02:06:05,700
[SPEAKER_08]: Congratulations, and welcome.

1084
02:06:12,142 --> 02:06:12,882
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.

1085
02:06:13,563 --> 02:06:13,783
[SPEAKER_08]: Cool.

1086
02:06:13,943 --> 02:06:15,303
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you sticking around are you done.

1087
02:06:17,484 --> 02:06:19,085
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, I don't think you need to, I just wanted to check.

1088
02:06:22,149 --> 02:06:27,335
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, 24 487 offered by the mayor capital stabilization fund appropriation requests.

1089
02:06:30,219 --> 02:06:58,158
[SPEAKER_08]: We have dear President bears and members of the city council, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approves the following appropriations, the capital stabilization fund, engine three truck pump replacement in the amount of $51,643 and 24 cents, cemetery soil removal in the amount $120,000 and zero cents, grant match for the municipal vulnerability preparedness action grant for updating the 2019 climate change of vulnerability assessment and developing an urban forest master plan in the amount of $24,600.

1090
02:07:00,680 --> 02:07:07,487
[SPEAKER_08]: and zero cents and city hall Howard all the memorial chambers window restoration and the amount of $322,500 and zero cents.

1091
02:07:08,168 --> 02:07:16,096
[SPEAKER_08]: As your honorable body knows any appropriation from the stabilization account requires two thirds majority vote of the city council capital stabilization fund currently has a balance of $3,923,737.

1092
02:07:19,760 --> 02:07:28,764
[SPEAKER_08]: given the appropriations made by the Council of the State, if all of the above are approved, the Capital Stabilization Fund would have $3,404,993.76 that remains.

1093
02:07:29,264 --> 02:07:31,265
[SPEAKER_08]: Fire Chief Evans will be available to answer questions.

1094
02:07:32,526 --> 02:07:35,827
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Chief Evans is here, DPW Commissioner McIvern's here, Paul Riggi's here.

1095
02:07:36,928 --> 02:07:41,430
[SPEAKER_08]: So we can go first to engine three, truck pump replacement, we'll go to Chief Evans.

1096
02:07:48,817 --> 02:07:49,237
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello again.

1097
02:07:50,058 --> 02:07:50,318
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey there.

1098
02:07:54,162 --> 02:08:10,516
[SPEAKER_09]: So addressing engine three there, I gave you some documentation just about some other trucks, just to look over later on if you wanted to, but this particular one just needed a, this is a 24 year old truck that,

1099
02:08:11,900 --> 02:08:15,763
[SPEAKER_09]: We looked into seeing if the pump in the truck would be able to be rebuilt.

1100
02:08:16,984 --> 02:08:20,827
[SPEAKER_09]: It wasn't able to be rebuilt, so they had to do a full replacement on the pump.

1101
02:08:21,447 --> 02:08:25,290
[SPEAKER_09]: And that ended up being the final total there for $51,643.24.

1102
02:08:25,330 --> 02:08:26,211
[SPEAKER_09]: Go ahead, Councilor Scarpelli.

1103
02:08:50,925 --> 02:08:51,285
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello?

1104
02:08:52,346 --> 02:08:53,666
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it me you're looking for?

1105
02:08:53,686 --> 02:08:56,267
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you hear that?

1106
02:08:56,387 --> 02:08:59,867
[SPEAKER_11]: Chief, I know that recently I saw, I think it was a Stoneham truck.

1107
02:09:00,768 --> 02:09:01,508
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's correct.

1108
02:09:01,588 --> 02:09:04,169
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to thank Stoneham for lending that engine to us.

1109
02:09:04,309 --> 02:09:07,829
[SPEAKER_09]: And Lexington has also lent an engine to us before.

1110
02:09:07,949 --> 02:09:14,151
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you to those communities and Wilmington expressed interest in being able to help us also if we need be.

1111
02:09:15,693 --> 02:09:22,838
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that's what's great with the fire department in your world that we can reach out to our brothers and sisters from neighboring communities to help.

1112
02:09:22,898 --> 02:09:31,403
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that my thing is that I know that as we look forward to the capital plan that the mayor put out, we know we have two trucks coming, right?

1113
02:09:32,184 --> 02:09:40,249
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know that there were questions last year that we wanted to order two more, but if we didn't do it a certain time, it would be,

1114
02:09:41,269 --> 02:09:41,990
[SPEAKER_11]: drastic, right?

1115
02:09:42,010 --> 02:09:45,352
[SPEAKER_11]: So what is I know the two are coming in 20 is it 2026?

1116
02:09:45,473 --> 02:09:48,995
[SPEAKER_09]: It's supposed to be towards the end of 2025.

1117
02:09:49,035 --> 02:09:57,842
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, basically, once you're doing training and everything on those trucks, they're not going to be in service until 2016.

1118
02:09:58,483 --> 02:10:03,547
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so it looks like we need some band aids to get us through these first two.

1119
02:10:03,687 --> 02:10:08,731
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I know that do you know when the plan is for the other two was part of our 14 plan?

1120
02:10:09,252 --> 02:10:09,772
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no.

1121
02:10:10,495 --> 02:10:14,057
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, that if we can, Mr. President, as part of them.

1122
02:10:14,697 --> 02:10:21,420
[SPEAKER_11]: We just get an update on the mayor's capital plan about the I know that we wanted to but waiting for two more fire trucks.

1123
02:10:21,960 --> 02:10:28,243
[SPEAKER_11]: I think because if we keep we keep band aiding and keep it'll be no different than what we're seeing with the streets.

1124
02:10:29,024 --> 02:10:31,705
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll have to say Brendan and the maintenance shop he's

1125
02:10:32,412 --> 02:10:34,934
[SPEAKER_09]: doing a great job trying to hold everything together.

1126
02:10:34,954 --> 02:10:36,215
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, Brennan's doing a great job.

1127
02:10:36,295 --> 02:10:40,098
[SPEAKER_11]: There's only so much bubble gum and duct tape that we can purchase.

1128
02:10:40,118 --> 02:10:53,187
[SPEAKER_11]: So I know that these are serious issues and making sure our firefighters have, you know, it'd be funny if everybody jumps into Bobby's oil truck to go fight a fire because we don't have a truck.

1129
02:10:53,227 --> 02:10:58,251
[SPEAKER_11]: So again, I think that I completely understand

1130
02:10:59,312 --> 02:11:02,655
[SPEAKER_11]: where we're going with this and it's if it's needed.

1131
02:11:03,215 --> 02:11:06,478
[SPEAKER_11]: I understand but I have other questions but I yield to my colleagues.

1132
02:11:07,559 --> 02:11:08,060
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1133
02:11:08,500 --> 02:11:13,905
[SPEAKER_08]: And I do have us penciled in December 11 for a meeting on stabilization funds capital planning.

1134
02:11:13,925 --> 02:11:15,386
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, thank you.

1135
02:11:15,426 --> 02:11:24,454
[SPEAKER_08]: There's the B paper by counselor Scott Kelly to request an update on the, the capital plan regarding the fire apparatus, the trucks.

1136
02:11:27,751 --> 02:11:31,734
[SPEAKER_08]: Any further questions for Chief Evans on the pump repair replacement.

1137
02:11:34,637 --> 02:11:35,217
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeing none.

1138
02:11:35,237 --> 02:11:44,405
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Chief, and we'll move next to cemetery soil removal and the grant match with Director McIvern, or Commissioner McIvern, my apologies.

1139
02:11:48,008 --> 02:11:48,389
[SPEAKER_17]: Hello everybody.

1140
02:11:49,926 --> 02:11:59,675
[SPEAKER_17]: Commissioner given, as you know, so the two things that I have in here are the soil removal of the cemetery, which this is just partially funding it basically completing it.

1141
02:12:00,375 --> 02:12:05,580
[SPEAKER_17]: So we came in under budget in total, we had a couple years, we put $250,000 for each year so totaling 500,000 capital plan.

1142
02:12:09,832 --> 02:12:21,217
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's coming in at about $340,000 to load, haul, test, and dispose of the soil to open up a new lawn at the cemetery.

1143
02:12:21,277 --> 02:12:22,257
[SPEAKER_17]: So this will complete that.

1144
02:12:23,678 --> 02:12:29,360
[SPEAKER_17]: And then the MVP cash match is pretty self-explanatory.

1145
02:12:29,420 --> 02:12:34,682
[SPEAKER_17]: So we're updating the vulnerability assessment and we're also creating a

1146
02:12:35,729 --> 02:12:37,009
[SPEAKER_17]: urban forestry master plan.

1147
02:12:37,069 --> 02:12:57,155
[SPEAKER_17]: So this is our second year working on this effort, and this should give us some excellent working documents to help increase the canopy in the city and tell us where and how and what to do when it comes to our forestry to maintain the cover that we all enjoy.

1148
02:12:57,735 --> 02:13:00,336
[SPEAKER_17]: So if there's any questions, I'm happy to answer them.

1149
02:13:01,617 --> 02:13:01,837
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

1150
02:13:01,857 --> 02:13:03,037
[SPEAKER_08]: We will go to Councilor Callahan.

1151
02:13:06,081 --> 02:13:06,862
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah, I touch it.

1152
02:13:06,922 --> 02:13:11,145
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't you don't touch the cemetery soil removal.

1153
02:13:11,585 --> 02:13:12,426
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I saw this on here.

1154
02:13:12,466 --> 02:13:15,048
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was assuming that was part of the Halloween zombie uprising initiative.

1155
02:13:16,629 --> 02:13:20,332
[SPEAKER_17]: I missed I missed my joke.

1156
02:13:20,792 --> 02:13:23,314
[SPEAKER_17]: I didn't understand.

1157
02:13:23,334 --> 02:13:26,256
[SPEAKER_05]: But I thought it was part of the whole business from Tim McGivern.

1158
02:13:26,556 --> 02:13:29,759
[SPEAKER_05]: Halloween Zombie Uprising Initiative.

1159
02:13:30,159 --> 02:13:30,479
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry?

1160
02:13:30,860 --> 02:13:33,042
[SPEAKER_05]: The Halloween Zombie Uprising Initiative.

1161
02:13:33,062 --> 02:13:34,202
[SPEAKER_05]: You're making me say it four times.

1162
02:13:34,223 --> 02:13:39,207
[SPEAKER_17]: No, it is not part of the Zombie Uprising Initiative.

1163
02:13:39,607 --> 02:13:40,968
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, okay, darn.

1164
02:13:42,169 --> 02:13:44,491
[SPEAKER_17]: No, just plain old soil removal and disposal.

1165
02:13:44,891 --> 02:13:45,272
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1166
02:13:45,632 --> 02:13:49,395
[SPEAKER_17]: And we will open up, this is slated to be a lawn in the future, so.

1167
02:13:51,417 --> 02:13:54,159
[SPEAKER_08]: This is in the back, if you've ever been, it's a giant pile of dirt.

1168
02:13:54,540 --> 02:13:54,740
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

1169
02:13:57,209 --> 02:13:59,431
[SPEAKER_17]: It's been there for so long, it almost doesn't look like a pile of dirt.

1170
02:13:59,571 --> 02:14:00,912
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like a pile of grass now.

1171
02:14:01,132 --> 02:14:01,653
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

1172
02:14:01,713 --> 02:14:13,022
[SPEAKER_17]: And one of the things that's going to come out of this, which I find the most interesting is just to know how much this costs, how much we produce every year and how much we should actually just be disposing of just as regular operations every single year.

1173
02:14:13,723 --> 02:14:16,025
[SPEAKER_17]: So we've been just accumulating a large pile.

1174
02:14:16,205 --> 02:14:18,087
[SPEAKER_17]: So those days I'm trying to end.

1175
02:14:19,304 --> 02:14:29,233
[SPEAKER_08]: I know as a member of the MMA's Public Works Committee, Mass Municipal Association, we talk often about the cost of remediating and removing soil.

1176
02:14:29,694 --> 02:14:30,875
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and it's a huge expense.

1177
02:14:32,036 --> 02:14:32,456
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

1178
02:14:33,497 --> 02:14:35,019
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, I'll go to Councilor Tseng.

1179
02:14:37,196 --> 02:14:41,597
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, I actually just wanted to ask more about that, so that helps.

1180
02:14:42,277 --> 02:14:56,240
[SPEAKER_18]: I was wondering, I know it's hard to give a precise timeline for the urban master, urban forest master plan, but I was wondering if you had any idea when we might be able to expect anything or?

1181
02:14:56,260 --> 02:15:01,821
[SPEAKER_17]: Sure, so within a year, so I think we do have pretty hard deadlines, this is grant funding.

1182
02:15:02,761 --> 02:15:06,382
[SPEAKER_17]: So the summertime next year, I think June is when,

1183
02:15:07,282 --> 02:15:08,463
[SPEAKER_17]: the deliverables are due.

1184
02:15:09,024 --> 02:15:11,125
[SPEAKER_17]: And as part of it, there's sort of milestones.

1185
02:15:11,466 --> 02:15:15,849
[SPEAKER_17]: One of the milestones is a tree inventory or completing an existing tree inventory.

1186
02:15:16,730 --> 02:15:18,712
[SPEAKER_17]: So just that alone is pretty exciting.

1187
02:15:18,772 --> 02:15:21,294
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's one of the early things that's gonna happen as part of this effort.

1188
02:15:23,676 --> 02:15:24,337
[SPEAKER_17]: Good, me too.

1189
02:15:24,677 --> 02:15:29,741
[SPEAKER_17]: The hardest part about getting lots of data is keeping it relevant and up to date.

1190
02:15:29,841 --> 02:15:32,784
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's gonna be the challenge we'll have moving forward once we have the data.

1191
02:15:37,242 --> 02:15:38,703
[SPEAKER_08]: Great, we'll go to Councilor Callahan.

1192
02:15:40,165 --> 02:15:50,593
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually stole my thunder because I was going to ask about that specifically, but I know the tree inventory is, you know, going to be done soon and just was going to ask about the plans for like how to keep that up to date.

1193
02:15:54,737 --> 02:15:55,678
[SPEAKER_17]: are forming.

1194
02:15:55,918 --> 02:16:05,508
[SPEAKER_17]: So we have one GIS person and one tree warden and they do meet somewhat regularly to update the GIS data.

1195
02:16:06,529 --> 02:16:08,971
[SPEAKER_17]: So we're exercising those processes now.

1196
02:16:09,532 --> 02:16:13,395
[SPEAKER_17]: So hopefully we'll have a regular cadence where data is being updated.

1197
02:16:16,058 --> 02:16:16,258
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

1198
02:16:16,919 --> 02:16:18,981
[SPEAKER_08]: Any further questions on the soil removal?

1199
02:16:20,842 --> 02:16:25,205
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeing none, we'll go to the grant match on the MVP action grant.

1200
02:16:25,545 --> 02:16:26,706
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything else on that?

1201
02:16:28,967 --> 02:16:30,168
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything else you want to say on that, Tim?

1202
02:16:31,329 --> 02:16:31,509
[SPEAKER_08]: Nope.

1203
02:16:32,830 --> 02:16:33,210
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1204
02:16:34,851 --> 02:16:37,833
[SPEAKER_08]: Then we can finish out with all the memorial chambers.

1205
02:16:37,873 --> 02:16:39,754
[SPEAKER_08]: Then we can take public participation on the item.

1206
02:16:40,615 --> 02:16:43,397
[SPEAKER_08]: We have Howard Alderman Memorial Chamber's window restoration.

1207
02:16:43,457 --> 02:16:47,419
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm guessing this has something to do with when I walked in here and there was broken glass after a windstorm.

1208
02:16:49,324 --> 02:16:54,650
[SPEAKER_08]: maybe hopefully more than that too, but I will go to Director, Facilities Manager, Ricky.

1209
02:16:54,670 --> 02:16:58,134
[SPEAKER_08]: Facilities Director, Ricky.

1210
02:17:00,797 --> 02:17:01,718
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor.

1211
02:17:02,198 --> 02:17:03,740
[SPEAKER_16]: President Bears, how are you tonight?

1212
02:17:05,121 --> 02:17:05,702
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm doing well.

1213
02:17:05,742 --> 02:17:09,386
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much for being here and sticking with us through the pandemic.

1214
02:17:09,406 --> 02:17:09,927
[SPEAKER_16]: No problem.

1215
02:17:13,411 --> 02:17:20,917
[SPEAKER_16]: It's very easy to see why the need for the windows in the council chambers need to be done.

1216
02:17:22,638 --> 02:17:35,388
[SPEAKER_16]: We are working with not only a contractor, but a firm called Old Bostonian who do historic window restoration and renovations.

1217
02:17:36,389 --> 02:17:38,431
[SPEAKER_16]: They do work at Faneuil Hall.

1218
02:17:39,358 --> 02:17:48,501
[SPEAKER_16]: So our plan is to restore the windows to as they were when they were first installed in the council chambers.

1219
02:17:49,902 --> 02:17:55,804
[SPEAKER_16]: The project would be done in two phases, where we would remove four windows.

1220
02:17:56,986 --> 02:18:01,588
[SPEAKER_16]: do the restoration, reinstall them, and then do the remaining five.

1221
02:18:01,748 --> 02:18:02,888
[SPEAKER_16]: There are nine windows.

1222
02:18:04,069 --> 02:18:15,613
[SPEAKER_16]: At all times, we would leave a window open on all sides, so there would still always be natural light coming into the chambers while the renovation was being done.

1223
02:18:17,213 --> 02:18:25,076
[SPEAKER_16]: It would also include new storm windows, and the windows would look brand new once everything was completed.

1224
02:18:29,994 --> 02:18:31,994
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, go to Councilor Scarpelli.

1225
02:18:32,735 --> 02:18:33,095
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm good.

1226
02:18:33,795 --> 02:18:37,176
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, then we will go to Councilor, anyone else?

1227
02:18:39,516 --> 02:18:41,697
[SPEAKER_08]: I just have a question, Paul.

1228
02:18:43,557 --> 02:18:50,919
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm assuming it'll be like historically accurate, but also environmentally, we'll be looking at, you know, modern windows to address the

1229
02:18:51,929 --> 02:18:55,632
[SPEAKER_08]: heat issue and make sure that we're keeping heat and cool air in the chamber.

1230
02:18:55,672 --> 02:18:57,853
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that's a huge problem as well with these windows.

1231
02:18:58,654 --> 02:19:04,558
[SPEAKER_16]: You will actually be looking at the original windows, but brought back up to modern standards.

1232
02:19:05,839 --> 02:19:06,159
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1233
02:19:06,520 --> 02:19:14,706
[SPEAKER_16]: To try to replace them, everybody wanted to use aluminum windows and that's not an acceptable replacement in the council chambers.

1234
02:19:15,575 --> 02:19:17,577
[SPEAKER_08]: because of the historical status of the building.

1235
02:19:18,437 --> 02:19:20,219
[SPEAKER_08]: And these are the original windows, right?

1236
02:19:20,799 --> 02:19:24,503
[SPEAKER_16]: As far as I can find any information, yes, they are.

1237
02:19:25,804 --> 02:19:28,146
[SPEAKER_08]: So they're about 85 years old or so.

1238
02:19:28,166 --> 02:19:28,366
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1239
02:19:28,826 --> 02:19:29,146
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1240
02:19:30,387 --> 02:19:31,468
[SPEAKER_08]: Any further questions on this?

1241
02:19:32,129 --> 02:19:33,010
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1242
02:19:34,291 --> 02:19:39,915
[SPEAKER_11]: Due to the situation with the override on November 5th, I would invoke rule 21

1243
02:19:41,132 --> 02:19:58,344
[SPEAKER_11]: to move this to the next meeting after the override for the fact that without understanding the true emergency.

1244
02:19:58,404 --> 02:20:01,427
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would invoke rule 21 and move this to the next meeting.

1245
02:20:01,487 --> 02:20:01,927
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1246
02:20:02,547 --> 02:20:04,589
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you invoking that on the whole paper?

1247
02:20:05,089 --> 02:20:05,590
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, please.

1248
02:20:06,010 --> 02:20:07,131
[SPEAKER_08]: All four items?

1249
02:20:08,319 --> 02:20:11,881
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, on that invocation, this is tabled to the next regular meeting.

1250
02:20:16,743 --> 02:20:17,663
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Director Riggi.

1251
02:20:17,723 --> 02:20:26,967
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you to everyone who came out tonight.

1252
02:20:26,987 --> 02:20:30,369
[SPEAKER_08]: 24-488, offered by the mayor, transfer and acquisition of rights in the public way.

1253
02:20:30,489 --> 02:20:37,292
[SPEAKER_08]: Dear President Paris, members of the city council, I respectfully request and recommend your honorable body approve the following transfer and acquisition of rights in a paper way.

1254
02:20:37,901 --> 02:20:48,211
[SPEAKER_08]: along Dexter Street, which will allow the mayor to enter into an agreement to release the city's rights to one half to the reference paper street in exchange for the city acquired rights to the other half of the same paper street.

1255
02:20:50,633 --> 02:20:53,176
[SPEAKER_08]: We have the building commissioner available to answer questions.

1256
02:20:59,285 --> 02:21:10,950
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'd like a motion to waive the remainder of the reading this is just seems highly technical and I'd like someone to explain it on the motion of Councilor Tseng seconded by second by Councilor Scott to waive the reading all those in favor.

1257
02:21:10,970 --> 02:21:13,831
[SPEAKER_08]: Opposed motion passes we'll go to the Commissioner.

1258
02:21:16,352 --> 02:21:18,533
[SPEAKER_08]: And are you representing the city.

1259
02:21:23,575 --> 02:21:25,596
[SPEAKER_08]: Great, we'll go to the Commissioner and then we'll go to you.

1260
02:21:25,656 --> 02:21:26,236
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for being here.

1261
02:21:29,551 --> 02:21:31,212
[SPEAKER_10]: Good evening, Council.

1262
02:21:32,413 --> 02:21:36,076
[SPEAKER_10]: This involves a property at 2 Joseph Street.

1263
02:21:37,017 --> 02:21:41,020
[SPEAKER_10]: Earlier this year, they had a retaining wall, fairly tall one that collapsed.

1264
02:21:42,654 --> 02:21:52,160
[SPEAKER_10]: it collapsed into essentially was an extension of Dexter, a paper street that was never constructed and you cannot pass on it anyways, it's very steep right there.

1265
02:21:53,101 --> 02:22:04,207
[SPEAKER_10]: In order to reconstruct their retaining wall, they need to use a portion of one half of that as we are the opposite of butters, the only two butters to that paper away.

1266
02:22:04,307 --> 02:22:04,448
[SPEAKER_10]: So,

1267
02:22:05,568 --> 02:22:17,459
[SPEAKER_10]: Under the laws, the best way to avoid any liability on our end and to give them the full use of the property, we essentially need to abandon the paper way that's there between the two of us.

1268
02:22:17,539 --> 02:22:23,684
[SPEAKER_10]: They get half, we get half, and then they can be issued a building permit to reconstruct the wall.

1269
02:22:25,286 --> 02:22:25,546
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1270
02:22:28,188 --> 02:22:28,448
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1271
02:22:28,468 --> 02:22:29,849
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm gonna go to Councilor Scarpelli.

1272
02:22:29,869 --> 02:22:31,170
[SPEAKER_11]: One quick question.

1273
02:22:31,810 --> 02:22:37,413
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you define paper way so people can understand what that means, because a lot of people like where's paper way in Medford.

1274
02:22:38,654 --> 02:22:41,576
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that we can just explain that a little bit that'd be great.

1275
02:22:44,457 --> 02:22:49,000
[SPEAKER_10]: Commissioner van de Wall, in terms of what is a paper way.

1276
02:22:49,830 --> 02:22:50,411
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, yep.

1277
02:22:51,091 --> 02:23:05,684
[SPEAKER_10]: It is a way that was laid out when the subdivision that created that neighborhood was done a long time ago, it was never constructed, and it was never accepted when the city accepted Joseph and Dexter so it's just floating out there essentially as an

1278
02:23:06,983 --> 02:23:13,188
[SPEAKER_10]: piece of land in which all abutters, in this case there's only two, have what they call rights to the fee in the way.

1279
02:23:13,368 --> 02:23:21,134
[SPEAKER_10]: But they have rights, they have sort of a partial ownership, but they cannot obstruct the rights of any other abutters to pass and repass at any time.

1280
02:23:21,635 --> 02:23:24,577
[SPEAKER_10]: The only way to sort of divorce ourselves from that is to

1281
02:23:26,979 --> 02:23:32,602
[SPEAKER_10]: dissolve the paper way by granting or receiving, giving up our rights to pass and repass.

1282
02:23:33,242 --> 02:23:36,724
[SPEAKER_10]: And then they can take that piece and use it for what they need to use it for.

1283
02:23:37,225 --> 02:23:38,285
[SPEAKER_10]: We get the other half.

1284
02:23:38,586 --> 02:23:44,709
[SPEAKER_10]: It can be adjoined to a property that several properties that are abutting to that as well.

1285
02:23:44,809 --> 02:23:45,990
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're split.

1286
02:23:46,030 --> 02:23:47,170
[SPEAKER_10]: It's kind of like a divorce.

1287
02:23:48,131 --> 02:23:49,292
[SPEAKER_10]: No contest to divorce.

1288
02:23:49,332 --> 02:23:53,154
[SPEAKER_10]: We get the half, they get their half and they can go about their way to construct their wall.

1289
02:23:55,253 --> 02:23:57,194
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, that's out of necessity, correct?

1290
02:23:57,254 --> 02:24:01,135
[SPEAKER_11]: Because of some structural issues to Joseph's way, is that what I'm?

1291
02:24:02,015 --> 02:24:03,395
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that what I'm saying?

1292
02:24:03,955 --> 02:24:05,396
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, their retaining wall collapsed.

1293
02:24:05,416 --> 02:24:10,877
[SPEAKER_10]: Their engineer's recommendations would require them to build partially on their half of the way.

1294
02:24:11,198 --> 02:24:19,720
[SPEAKER_10]: So in order to preserve the city's rights, probably more to keep us from getting any liability with the construction of that or

1295
02:24:21,035 --> 02:24:25,417
[SPEAKER_10]: the long-term use of that property, we have to sort of give up our rights to pass and repass on it.

1296
02:24:25,997 --> 02:24:29,199
[SPEAKER_10]: But again, it's a very steep slope leading down to the school there.

1297
02:24:29,219 --> 02:24:35,322
[SPEAKER_10]: It is not functional as a road or as a piece of property, except for building retaining walls on this.

1298
02:24:35,482 --> 02:24:38,183
[SPEAKER_10]: Retaining walls could be, I don't know, 15, 20 feet tall.

1299
02:24:38,924 --> 02:24:40,965
[SPEAKER_10]: It holds up part of the property of 2 Joseph.

1300
02:24:43,966 --> 02:24:45,006
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I'm looking at it right now.

1301
02:24:45,026 --> 02:24:46,007
[SPEAKER_08]: It's an interesting location.

1302
02:24:46,027 --> 02:24:46,867
[SPEAKER_11]: It looks pretty dangerous.

1303
02:24:47,668 --> 02:24:47,968
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1304
02:24:49,279 --> 02:24:52,881
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll go to Vice President Collins.

1305
02:24:55,842 --> 02:25:04,446
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Commissioner for being with us tonight, just to again paraphrase this to make sure that I haven't taken a look at that site as well in anticipation of the meeting.

1306
02:25:04,947 --> 02:25:06,327
[SPEAKER_25]: So just to make sure I have a correct.

1307
02:25:10,365 --> 02:25:20,701
[SPEAKER_25]: This transfer of the paper way would allow to Joseph Street to reconstruct the retaining wall, which fell down earlier this year and transferring

1308
02:25:22,745 --> 02:25:32,507
[SPEAKER_25]: Transferring one half the rates would allow them to do that and transferring the rights on the city side would remove us from liability so that they could go about and do their construction in a way that wouldn't implicate the city.

1309
02:25:32,707 --> 02:25:39,068
[SPEAKER_25]: And it's not like we're going to build a city road on that paper way anyway, due to the grade, it would be dangerous.

1310
02:25:39,108 --> 02:25:41,829
[SPEAKER_25]: So that wouldn't come about in the future anyway.

1311
02:25:41,889 --> 02:25:42,349
[SPEAKER_25]: Is that correct?

1312
02:25:42,369 --> 02:25:43,589
[SPEAKER_10]: That is correct.

1313
02:25:43,609 --> 02:25:50,191
[SPEAKER_10]: We're giving up our rights to allow them to build on it without any liability on the part of the city, either during construction or into the future.

1314
02:25:50,611 --> 02:25:52,351
[SPEAKER_10]: And they do need that per their engineers.

1315
02:25:56,015 --> 02:25:57,316
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, great.

1316
02:25:57,457 --> 02:25:59,119
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you go to counselor saying.

1317
02:26:01,581 --> 02:26:01,962
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1318
02:26:02,182 --> 02:26:07,428
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, I just also wanted to, I don't I don't want, I want to make sure the family gets what they need.

1319
02:26:07,748 --> 02:26:08,910
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't want to stand away with that.

1320
02:26:09,130 --> 02:26:10,772
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm just to help us understand.

1321
02:26:11,673 --> 02:26:14,536
[SPEAKER_18]: Does the city currently own title to the paperweight.

1322
02:26:16,641 --> 02:26:25,647
[SPEAKER_10]: Any paper way is owned to the, what they call the fee of the midpoint of the road, but all of butters, that's a pretty common thing throughout any private way or paper way.

1323
02:26:25,687 --> 02:26:27,889
[SPEAKER_10]: This just happens never to have been constructed.

1324
02:26:28,449 --> 02:26:33,813
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're basically, we own it, but we have to grant rights to the other butters to pass and repass.

1325
02:26:33,913 --> 02:26:36,574
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're giving up those rights and we get to keep our half.

1326
02:26:37,115 --> 02:26:40,217
[SPEAKER_10]: We can append it to an existing piece of property we want there.

1327
02:26:40,277 --> 02:26:46,021
[SPEAKER_10]: We can leave it as a separate piece, but we're sort of giving up our rights to use the other half and allowing St.

1328
02:26:46,681 --> 02:26:50,044
[SPEAKER_10]: the Joseph property to construct upon it as if it were their own.

1329
02:26:52,727 --> 02:26:53,007
[SPEAKER_18]: I see.

1330
02:26:53,127 --> 02:26:53,487
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1331
02:26:53,567 --> 02:26:54,909
[SPEAKER_18]: That clarifies a lot.

1332
02:26:55,029 --> 02:27:01,174
[SPEAKER_18]: And then I was just wondering, is the liability piece, I guess what's the difference between this and an easement?

1333
02:27:01,395 --> 02:27:09,062
[SPEAKER_18]: And then does the liability piece play into that about why this is the way we're doing it as a city?

1334
02:27:10,359 --> 02:27:20,683
[SPEAKER_10]: And that was the key reason why we decided to go this way was to not have any liability for construction, taking part on property that the city had some form of interest in.

1335
02:27:20,903 --> 02:27:26,246
[SPEAKER_10]: So by releasing our rights and by releasing their half of the property to them, it's theirs.

1336
02:27:26,306 --> 02:27:32,028
[SPEAKER_10]: It's no longer something we have interest in and it should be to our advantage for our liability.

1337
02:27:33,305 --> 02:27:38,369
[SPEAKER_18]: Great, and this is a slightly separate question, so we can keep it short.

1338
02:27:39,450 --> 02:27:50,440
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it's noted in the memo that if we approve this, the city property may be used as a two-family as of right.

1339
02:27:51,701 --> 02:27:55,364
[SPEAKER_18]: Is that something that's not an option right now without approving this?

1340
02:27:58,311 --> 02:28:00,432
[SPEAKER_10]: There's three adjacent properties there.

1341
02:28:00,452 --> 02:28:10,937
[SPEAKER_10]: There's the immediately abutting property to the left-hand side, and then there's two more properties sort of landlocked to some extent, although they show a frontage down below, you really can't get there.

1342
02:28:10,977 --> 02:28:13,378
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's three pieces of property that in combination,

1343
02:28:14,398 --> 02:28:23,061
[SPEAKER_10]: are roughly 7,000 plus square feet, which does allow for a two-family by right under the GR zone that that is in.

1344
02:28:23,121 --> 02:28:27,782
[SPEAKER_10]: This would add to the property almost making almost 9,000 square foot.

1345
02:28:28,422 --> 02:28:31,223
[SPEAKER_10]: It wouldn't increase the rights to build a two-family.

1346
02:28:32,183 --> 02:28:36,206
[SPEAKER_10]: but absent any form of zoning changes in the next year that might affect that.

1347
02:28:36,246 --> 02:28:44,052
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're basically taking it from 7,000 and change to about 9,000 and change over basically four pieces of property in a row.

1348
02:28:44,072 --> 02:28:48,435
[SPEAKER_10]: They're all small and 2000 plus range, and they're all owned by the city.

1349
02:28:48,476 --> 02:28:52,178
[SPEAKER_10]: So whatever the city would decide to do with that down the road is a decision yet to be made.

1350
02:28:53,619 --> 02:28:56,922
[SPEAKER_08]: And these are the properties on technically actually on East Albion.

1351
02:28:59,022 --> 02:29:04,865
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, the X11, all three X11 properties, I believe, in a row from left to right.

1352
02:29:05,726 --> 02:29:13,951
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, if you look at the state property map, you can see the paper way between 2 Joseph and then the city's parcel at 0 Albion.

1353
02:29:15,351 --> 02:29:16,592
[SPEAKER_08]: The three next to each other.

1354
02:29:16,632 --> 02:29:21,455
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that are all abutting 86 Dexter, that long lot.

1355
02:29:27,168 --> 02:29:28,789
[SPEAKER_08]: Any further questions by members of the council?

1356
02:29:31,070 --> 02:29:34,271
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeing none, we will go to the council.

1357
02:29:34,291 --> 02:29:35,411
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you council for the?

1358
02:29:36,152 --> 02:29:36,372
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

1359
02:29:37,072 --> 02:29:37,272
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

1360
02:29:37,512 --> 02:29:38,753
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me turn on your microphone.

1361
02:29:40,193 --> 02:29:42,034
[SPEAKER_08]: Just give us your name and address for the record, please.

1362
02:29:42,134 --> 02:29:44,935
[SPEAKER_01]: Mary Catadella from Touchstone Law Offices in Andover.

1363
02:29:45,015 --> 02:29:47,156
[SPEAKER_01]: I represent the owners of 2 Joseph Street.

1364
02:29:47,836 --> 02:29:51,678
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have a map here and I made extra copies in case people want to see it.

1365
02:29:51,698 --> 02:29:53,099
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a hard thing to understand.

1366
02:29:53,119 --> 02:29:55,179
[SPEAKER_01]: I should have gone to you first.

1367
02:29:57,300 --> 02:29:59,442
[SPEAKER_01]: My clients appreciate this consideration.

1368
02:29:59,862 --> 02:30:02,384
[SPEAKER_01]: This house was built in the late 1880s.

1369
02:30:03,224 --> 02:30:09,108
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe that the building inspector in fact condemned the front porch in the backyard.

1370
02:30:09,808 --> 02:30:13,631
[SPEAKER_01]: As a result of this, this landslide this problem.

1371
02:30:14,051 --> 02:30:15,552
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is an immediate thing.

1372
02:30:16,252 --> 02:30:19,933
[SPEAKER_01]: We will be giving up our rights on the other side of the street as well.

1373
02:30:20,033 --> 02:30:21,074
[SPEAKER_01]: So the city will have that.

1374
02:30:21,494 --> 02:30:29,257
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that these lots that are on the other side of Dexter Street are as a result of tax taking many, many decades ago.

1375
02:30:30,237 --> 02:30:32,158
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe the city can do something with it now.

1376
02:30:33,799 --> 02:30:36,860
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than that, I don't have anything further unless anybody has any questions.

1377
02:30:38,681 --> 02:30:41,942
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion of Councilor Scarpa to approve, seconded by

1378
02:30:43,294 --> 02:30:44,536
[SPEAKER_08]: Seconded by Councilor Leming.

1379
02:30:45,397 --> 02:30:46,238
[SPEAKER_08]: Any further discussion?

1380
02:30:48,781 --> 02:30:51,445
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeing none, and it seems like everyone's on the same page here.

1381
02:30:51,465 --> 02:30:53,127
[SPEAKER_08]: I will go to Councilor Gallihan.

1382
02:30:56,943 --> 02:31:00,785
[SPEAKER_04]: I was only going to say that I did walk by this yesterday.

1383
02:31:02,005 --> 02:31:09,189
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a, I mean, you can see the retaining wall that has, you know, just totally fallen all the way down the hill.

1384
02:31:09,289 --> 02:31:13,551
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it really looks like it's needs immediate attention.

1385
02:31:15,452 --> 02:31:15,692
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

1386
02:31:15,732 --> 02:31:16,112
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1387
02:31:16,132 --> 02:31:16,252
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

02:31:16,272 --> 02:31:19,934
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's right across the street from the Missittuck School in the Columbus Park.

[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
