1
00:00:00,623 --> 00:00:04,326
evening, welcome to the January 8th method conservation commission hearing.

2
00:00:05,086 --> 00:00:16,294
Um, we have, we have a number of items continued from last meeting on December 18th that are being continued until January 22nd.

3
00:00:16,854 --> 00:00:20,376
That is the notice of intent for the super road improvements dp file number 215-0239 and

4
00:00:23,277 --> 00:00:33,367
The notice of intent for 28 sick morning I'm you dp file 2, 1, 5, dash 0, 2, 3, 8, both of those are going to be continued at our January 22nd conservation hearing and.

5
00:00:33,987 --> 00:00:43,116
The next item on the agenda is a notice of intent 28 pathway and boardwalk file number 2, 1, 5 dash 0, 2, 4, 0, continue from December 18th, 2024.

6
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:55,702
City met for some notes from 10 for the construction post pathways in a boardwalk under the fells way route 28 bridge in Medford projects located within an adjacent to the following resource areas bordering on subject flooding.

7
00:00:56,483 --> 00:00:59,704
Bank of the perennial where land underwater border with subject flooding.

8
00:00:59,724 --> 00:01:05,625
We're from the area, MR. And a 100 foot adjacent upland resource area buffer zone to a porting of educated well.

9
00:01:06,246 --> 00:01:10,907
Project considered a limited project per section 10.5 3 3 J of what the protection act.

10
00:01:15,453 --> 00:01:25,860
and let the record show that I recused myself from this project hearing as well as I did on December 18th.

11
00:01:26,701 --> 00:01:29,703
Thank you, Heidi.

12
00:01:44,787 --> 00:01:47,189
So just we did get the.

13
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:50,292
The update the information from.

14
00:01:52,173 --> 00:01:59,960
The applicant Monday evening, but I. Just not sure if the board is that fully chance to fully review everything that we got.

15
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:04,744
So, I just figured we sort of sound that maybe we go to the board and sort of let them discuss that.

16
00:02:07,486 --> 00:02:08,407
Thanks, Dennis.

17
00:02:08,907 --> 00:02:09,968
I see John.

18
00:02:10,835 --> 00:02:16,658
Is anybody else from your team joining us, John?

19
00:02:16,978 --> 00:02:21,501
I do see Kevin Thompson from MAPS DOT on the call.

20
00:02:21,981 --> 00:02:31,246
And then I think Amber Christopherson from DCR was going to join in case there are any questions for the DCR.

21
00:02:31,266 --> 00:02:33,587
I don't see her on yet.

22
00:02:35,771 --> 00:02:36,872
Thanks for that.

23
00:02:37,792 --> 00:02:42,915
I did, as a matter of fact, have a few minutes today to review the materials.

24
00:02:42,935 --> 00:02:45,056
Thank you very much for providing those.

25
00:02:45,236 --> 00:02:53,600
I will defer to my colleagues on the commission, whether they feel they need additional time to review those materials.

26
00:02:55,321 --> 00:02:59,863
That said, if I may, I would like to jump in with a couple of questions that I had.

27
00:03:00,543 --> 00:03:04,285
I thought your plan that shows the qualifying area very helpful.

28
00:03:05,699 --> 00:03:06,880
Thank you for providing that.

29
00:03:08,342 --> 00:03:12,908
With respect to, I don't know if you're able to pull that up on the screen.

30
00:03:12,928 --> 00:03:15,872
Yep, I can share that.

31
00:03:16,373 --> 00:03:17,354
Yeah, there we go.

32
00:03:17,374 --> 00:03:18,516
All right, give me one second.

33
00:03:18,576 --> 00:03:19,837
You are now closed.

34
00:03:19,857 --> 00:03:20,358
You're good to go.

35
00:03:34,066 --> 00:03:39,829
Okay, so this is the letter in response to the questions and the items that commission.

36
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:45,953
Requested at the last hearing, you can walk through them 1 at a time.

37
00:03:46,013 --> 00:03:50,476
If there's no specific questions you want to jump into, or do you want to ask your questions 1st?

38
00:03:50,596 --> 00:03:50,796
Eric.

39
00:03:52,157 --> 00:03:59,021
Yeah, if I can, I would like to jump to your 1st plan that had hatching for your qualifying areas.

40
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:07,531
That was, yes, this one.

41
00:04:07,551 --> 00:04:16,980
And the westerly most area, I'm fine with this, I should say I'm fine with this approach.

42
00:04:17,421 --> 00:04:28,772
I just, I wanted to, I wanted you to confirm that the westerly most qualified area meets the requirements in terms of setback from bank

43
00:04:30,231 --> 00:04:31,452
and potentially buffer zone.

44
00:04:31,512 --> 00:04:33,792
It's just that the resource areas weren't on there.

45
00:04:33,872 --> 00:04:42,676
And looking very quickly, I just want to make sure that we are capturing the adequate square footage in the correct areas.

46
00:04:42,696 --> 00:04:50,939
So this area over here, maybe?

47
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:52,279
Yeah, correct.

48
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,981
Let's see.

49
00:04:57,635 --> 00:04:58,776
There's a scale on here.

50
00:04:58,836 --> 00:05:01,157
I can see how far that hatching is.

51
00:05:01,177 --> 00:05:05,260
50 feet.

52
00:05:07,961 --> 00:05:08,181
Yeah.

53
00:05:08,221 --> 00:05:11,943
My suspicion is it just needs to be turned around a little bit.

54
00:05:12,444 --> 00:05:12,644
Yeah.

55
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:16,166
Yeah.

56
00:05:16,246 --> 00:05:22,069
It looks like 50 feet would be maybe, maybe right about here.

57
00:05:22,089 --> 00:05:23,030
Yeah.

58
00:05:29,883 --> 00:05:36,087
just drawing something parallel to the wetland flags.

59
00:05:39,508 --> 00:05:42,070
So yeah, so maybe a little bit less area.

60
00:05:47,172 --> 00:05:49,133
We can recalculate that and update the plan.

61
00:05:49,853 --> 00:05:53,175
Yeah, I think it is likely just a massaging of that area.

62
00:05:55,316 --> 00:05:56,577
And relatedly,

63
00:05:57,524 --> 00:06:02,046
The supplemental material that you provided referenced an O&M plan.

64
00:06:05,807 --> 00:06:14,370
Is that something you could share in draft form with the commission if one is being developed?

65
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:24,333
My concern primarily is that any of these qualifying areas during and after construction are

66
00:06:26,418 --> 00:06:31,301
identified as such and maintained in a manner that allows them to function as design.

67
00:06:31,321 --> 00:06:38,144
And I think the O&M plan would capture that.

68
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:41,446
Okay.

69
00:06:41,606 --> 00:06:41,786
Yeah.

70
00:06:42,066 --> 00:06:45,008
I don't know if we have a fully developed O&M plan.

71
00:06:45,048 --> 00:06:46,669
We have commitment from the DCR.

72
00:06:46,689 --> 00:06:54,293
I mean, this is a DCR parkland that they will maintain and consistent with how they maintain all of their parkland.

73
00:06:55,368 --> 00:06:55,628
Yeah.

74
00:06:56,628 --> 00:07:04,930
So maybe that's, maybe that goes into the order of conditions, just saying that, you know, the, the owner will continue to, to maintain these areas.

75
00:07:06,771 --> 00:07:06,951
Yeah.

76
00:07:06,991 --> 00:07:10,092
I'm particularly concerned about soil compaction in that area.

77
00:07:11,292 --> 00:07:11,512
Right.

78
00:07:11,532 --> 00:07:14,033
I mean, we're relying on infiltration.

79
00:07:14,053 --> 00:07:22,775
Um, just knowing how these areas can be used, whether per regular maintenance or just public use.

80
00:07:23,815 --> 00:07:23,915
Um,

81
00:07:25,456 --> 00:07:34,561
there's some way to capture the long-term maintenance of that area as a qualifying area.

82
00:07:34,581 --> 00:07:37,882
I would be keen to see that in some way.

83
00:07:43,802 --> 00:07:45,844
Otherwise, I really do appreciate the material.

84
00:07:45,864 --> 00:07:53,870
I didn't have any additional questions, but like I said, at the top, I'll defer to my colleagues if they had a chance.

85
00:07:53,930 --> 00:08:03,277
If not, I would certainly entertain a motion that you're willing to continue to our next hearing to provide them the opportunity to review the materials.

86
00:08:07,544 --> 00:08:17,167
Eric, I'll say that I did have an opportunity to review the responses to the couple of questions I had about boardwalk material and decking design.

87
00:08:19,188 --> 00:08:25,330
And I understand the durability of the material that's proposed and all the reasons that it's being used.

88
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:31,472
I still don't agree with the notion that it's sustainable, but I don't really think that's the purview here.

89
00:08:32,353 --> 00:08:36,054
So I have no other issues or questions either.

90
00:08:37,254 --> 00:08:37,414
Thanks.

91
00:08:40,796 --> 00:08:42,277
I'll chime in.

92
00:08:42,337 --> 00:08:51,082
I think the question that I had from the previous hearing was regarding essential alternatives analysis for stormwater structures.

93
00:08:51,923 --> 00:09:04,610
I didn't have an opportunity to review this before the meeting, but I've spent the last 13 minutes reading through what you submitted, and I think you address the

94
00:09:05,848 --> 00:09:31,745
The gist of the question, I agree that given the amount of vegetation I'm considering, as Jeremy has been working to inform his commission of over the last couple of months, the root diameters of the existing trees and the root diameters of the new trees coming in, I'm satisfied with the response to that question.

95
00:09:31,846 --> 00:09:35,228
So I think no further questions for me on the stormwater aspect.

96
00:09:36,653 --> 00:09:37,293
Great, thank you.

97
00:09:41,215 --> 00:09:52,600
And I'll just add, I haven't had a chance to meaningfully review this, but I don't think it's in response to any question I had, so I'm comfortable if the rest of the commissioners are.

98
00:09:56,602 --> 00:10:00,484
Yeah, I will second Craig's sentiment.

99
00:10:00,524 --> 00:10:02,005
I did have a chance to review that.

100
00:10:03,685 --> 00:10:05,026
I agree with the conclusions as well.

101
00:10:05,386 --> 00:10:17,094
I don't think, let me put it this way, I guess I would entertain a motion to issue an order of conditions for this project.

102
00:10:18,955 --> 00:10:25,300
Dennis, I'll leave it up to you how best to word this, but I would like to see an O&M plan.

103
00:10:26,841 --> 00:10:29,803
Perhaps that's a, even in draft form,

104
00:10:31,847 --> 00:10:36,209
but perhaps that's a pre-construction document that gets submitted to the commission.

105
00:10:36,729 --> 00:10:39,470
I don't know if we have language we typically use for such a request.

106
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:55,575
We've done something similar in the past where we basically had the O&M plan is submitted to the agent for review prior to acceptance by the applicant and things like that.

107
00:10:55,595 --> 00:11:00,037
Just so that before it actually is formalized, it comes before me to approve it.

108
00:11:00,077 --> 00:11:00,677
Even in that case,

109
00:11:01,904 --> 00:11:14,852
send it off to you or one of the other members just as a secondary reviewer that would you know it wouldn't be a full commission review requiring a hearing but it could just be you know double checked by another member of the commission in addition to myself.

110
00:11:15,873 --> 00:11:22,637
Yeah John if that makes sense to you and you think that's feasible that would sort of certainly satisfy me.

111
00:11:23,358 --> 00:11:30,122
Yep that'd be great if you included that and so that would be an order that it would have to be provided before construction or

112
00:11:30,889 --> 00:11:31,990
Yeah.

113
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:39,456
Dennis, do we have a standard condition about notifying the commission X number of days before instruction starts?

114
00:11:39,476 --> 00:11:45,400
Just doing a little bit of word search and other older orders.

115
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:49,363
I think we do.

116
00:11:49,403 --> 00:11:51,925
I think that's a fairly standard ask.

117
00:11:52,406 --> 00:11:52,706
Yeah.

118
00:11:53,707 --> 00:11:54,948
And I guess my

119
00:11:55,792 --> 00:12:05,499
Suggestion would be that a draft O&M plan would be submitted no later than whatever that date is.

120
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:19,930
I would expect we'd get it to you sooner, but if you had a date, since I have to confirm it with the DCR, since they'll be the ones committing to the maintenance.

121
00:12:20,691 --> 00:12:20,831
Yeah.

122
00:12:27,245 --> 00:12:28,886
We've definitely done this before.

123
00:12:28,906 --> 00:12:43,338
I see a template on one of our prior projects.

124
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:48,682
Number 26, the applicant must notify the commission in writing one week before any activity commences.

125
00:12:49,642 --> 00:12:56,788
At the time of notice, the applicant shall provide evidence that the order has been filed at the registry of deeds.

126
00:12:58,588 --> 00:13:04,854
In which case, I'd probably ask that plan be submitted maybe 2 weeks before because a week before doesn't really give.

127
00:13:06,135 --> 00:13:09,197
Time for review and revisions if needed.

128
00:13:11,259 --> 00:13:12,440
Yeah, I agree with that.

129
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:21,148
Okay, so in addition to our normal sort of standard or just submitted 2 weeks prior to the start of construction.

130
00:13:22,549 --> 00:13:24,531
Yes, please sounds good.

131
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:32,447
And just so I understand, what's the mechanism for us providing feedback on that?

132
00:13:32,507 --> 00:13:41,032
Does that require a hearing to review or can we provide written comments or requests back to the proponents?

133
00:13:42,072 --> 00:13:48,435
I think it should be, at least I was envisioning that Dennis would approve of the O&M plan.

134
00:13:49,616 --> 00:13:55,459
So we internally as a commission could review that plan and provide comments to Dennis.

135
00:13:57,312 --> 00:14:00,113
But at the end of the day, there will be thumbs up or thumbs down.

136
00:14:00,933 --> 00:14:10,916
I'm just sort of, and I sort of send it off to you all basically, you know, send it individually so that any comments back from you all are not, there's no cross contamination of comments.

137
00:14:10,936 --> 00:14:14,257
So there's no coordination or discussion between you all about it.

138
00:14:14,597 --> 00:14:16,338
So I just get some individual comments from you.

139
00:14:17,178 --> 00:14:18,638
And then that would be that would be sufficient.

140
00:14:18,678 --> 00:14:20,519
So that way, we don't have to schedule a hearing.

141
00:14:25,924 --> 00:14:26,725
That makes sense to me.

142
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:38,913
That's all I had, unless any other member has something.

143
00:14:38,953 --> 00:14:42,876
I think we should hear a motion.

144
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:53,304
I can make a motion to approve this filing with the orders previously stated on top of the standard slate

145
00:14:54,868 --> 00:14:56,028
in Medford ComComm orders.

146
00:14:58,870 --> 00:14:59,450
Second.

147
00:15:01,551 --> 00:15:03,291
We'll do a roll call here.

148
00:15:05,972 --> 00:15:06,492
Jeremy.

149
00:15:07,693 --> 00:15:07,793
Aye.

150
00:15:08,493 --> 00:15:08,793
Heather.

151
00:15:09,834 --> 00:15:09,954
Aye.

152
00:15:11,514 --> 00:15:11,814
Craig.

153
00:15:12,775 --> 00:15:12,895
Aye.

154
00:15:13,595 --> 00:15:14,015
Caroline.

155
00:15:14,896 --> 00:15:15,036
Aye.

156
00:15:15,716 --> 00:15:16,576
And Ayme and Aye.

157
00:15:16,936 --> 00:15:17,437
Ayes have it.

158
00:15:20,938 --> 00:15:21,158
All right.

159
00:15:26,171 --> 00:15:27,352
Great, thank you very much.

160
00:15:27,412 --> 00:15:27,992
We're all set.

161
00:15:28,513 --> 00:15:35,998
I will work on getting that to you pretty quickly, so I'm being out of the office possibly for the next couple of days, but I should be around to work on that.

162
00:15:36,098 --> 00:15:37,159
It's pretty straightforward.

163
00:15:37,439 --> 00:15:38,000
That's fine.

164
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:38,640
Thank you very much.

165
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,781
Have a good evening, everyone.

166
00:15:40,402 --> 00:15:40,722
Thank you.

167
00:15:41,242 --> 00:15:41,702
You, too.

168
00:15:41,722 --> 00:15:41,943
Thanks.

169
00:15:45,165 --> 00:15:50,289
All right.

170
00:15:51,755 --> 00:15:55,577
Our next item on the agenda is a notice of intent for 53 Winford way.

171
00:15:56,097 --> 00:16:06,001
The people are 2, 1, 5, 0, 2, 4, 1, Nicholas trying to sell the most intent to demolish an existing single-family dwelling at 53 Winford way start a new single-family going up property.

172
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:10,422
The proposed work will take place in the 100 foot buffer zone to a boarding educated well.

173
00:16:16,665 --> 00:16:19,586
We do have a representative on the line it's at a market on the show.

174
00:16:20,933 --> 00:16:22,814
Although he looks like he's having problems with audio.

175
00:16:22,834 --> 00:16:29,439
I don't know if that's... I don't know if he's actually gotten through.

176
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,701
See if he's emailed me.

177
00:16:41,968 --> 00:16:47,212
Can you call him at that number, Dennis, and see if he... Yeah, I think I'm gonna...

178
00:17:01,167 --> 00:17:02,968
I think they may have just and you did.

179
00:17:02,988 --> 00:17:04,948
And so.

180
00:17:05,889 --> 00:17:06,729
Also by this.

181
00:17:08,609 --> 00:17:11,430
And more now just 51 when the way.

182
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:16,132
Okay, you're in a better going to the project.

183
00:17:16,912 --> 00:17:19,973
Yes, we just had a couple of questions.

184
00:17:21,117 --> 00:17:31,388
Okay, we will certainly give you the opportunity to ask those questions, but the conservation commission will need to hear the presentation and then deliberate and then you'll get a chance to speak.

185
00:17:32,249 --> 00:17:32,610
Thank you.

186
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:38,636
You're very welcome.

187
00:17:38,696 --> 00:17:39,858
Mr. Marshawn are you with us?

188
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:14,930
Did you throw that phone number down?

189
00:18:19,732 --> 00:18:21,592
Sorry, there were people in the next room talking very loud.

190
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:25,733
So I didn't mean to try to get in the hush.

191
00:18:26,874 --> 00:18:27,874
It looks like he's connected.

192
00:18:27,914 --> 00:18:30,075
So I don't know, Adam, if you can hear us.

193
00:18:30,575 --> 00:18:31,455
You're on mute.

194
00:18:32,075 --> 00:18:32,675
I can, yes.

195
00:18:32,735 --> 00:18:33,235
Sorry.

196
00:18:33,756 --> 00:18:34,276
OK, great.

197
00:18:37,036 --> 00:18:37,617
Am I late?

198
00:18:37,657 --> 00:18:38,577
I thought the meeting started at 7.

199
00:18:40,095 --> 00:18:41,015
No, I started at 6.30.

200
00:18:41,715 --> 00:18:42,215
Oh, geez.

201
00:18:42,636 --> 00:18:43,496
I'm sorry about that.

202
00:18:43,596 --> 00:18:44,616
I just put the kids to bed.

203
00:18:44,676 --> 00:18:46,996
I thought it was at 7.

204
00:18:47,036 --> 00:18:47,136
Nope.

205
00:18:48,177 --> 00:18:57,759
You're all right, because we just finished the... You're literally up, so we just finished the case right before you, so... Okay, excellent.

206
00:18:57,799 --> 00:18:58,219
Thank you.

207
00:19:00,659 --> 00:19:02,740
Can you give us an overview of the project, please?

208
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,620
Sure, absolutely.

209
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,201
So, my name is Adam Ashanda from Ashanda and Associates.

210
00:19:09,989 --> 00:19:15,132
And I submitted a notice of intent for 53 Winford Way.

211
00:19:15,152 --> 00:19:25,658
I guess, well, the project, the building itself is taking place in Medford, majority of the work.

212
00:19:26,138 --> 00:19:29,560
So currently on site, there's an existing dwelling.

213
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:33,642
And the plan is the client would like to

214
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:39,774
raise that dwelling and construct a new house on that lot, a single family.

215
00:19:41,996 --> 00:19:49,961
And in the backyard, you can see it's kind of a steep grade as it is already towards the wetlands.

216
00:19:50,542 --> 00:19:59,248
So I'm proposing a three to one slope to come up to meet the appropriate grade that I'd need for the house.

217
00:20:00,129 --> 00:20:00,269
And

218
00:20:01,195 --> 00:20:03,095
we will put erosion control.

219
00:20:03,636 --> 00:20:16,978
You'll see by the wetlands, I have the erosion control slash limit of work in the back, as well as I am proposing underground infiltration systems to accommodate the roof runoff.

220
00:20:18,179 --> 00:20:24,060
So the entire runoff in the building will be infiltrated into groundwater.

221
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:28,141
And I did calculations for the

222
00:20:30,055 --> 00:20:31,075
I didn't provide them.

223
00:20:31,155 --> 00:20:34,696
I actually have them here with me, and I can provide them if you would like them.

224
00:20:34,776 --> 00:20:41,278
But I did size the recharge systems and do some calculations.

225
00:20:41,298 --> 00:20:44,079
And we didn't do any soil testing out there.

226
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:48,000
But what I did was I pulled a soil map off USDA.

227
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:58,843
And based on the hydraulic soil group, I was able to calculate the drawdown and size the chambers for volume static.

228
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:10,375
And in the front yard, you'll see that we're proposing, you know, a bit conk drive, but we're tying into the existing curb cuts.

229
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:13,257
So we're not proposing any new curb cuts.

230
00:21:13,297 --> 00:21:14,578
We're just tying into the existing.

231
00:21:15,538 --> 00:21:21,422
And I guess they already cut and capped the sewer and the water services.

232
00:21:21,742 --> 00:21:26,825
So the game plan would be just to tie into the, to grab those and run them into the foundation.

233
00:21:34,732 --> 00:21:35,272
Great thank you.

234
00:21:35,292 --> 00:21:36,413
You're welcome.

235
00:21:40,457 --> 00:21:42,018
Commission do you have any questions?

236
00:21:50,245 --> 00:21:52,387
Sure, I can go Heidi if that works.

237
00:21:52,907 --> 00:21:53,768
Sure, of course.

238
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:01,442
First question I just had, who delineated the wetlands?

239
00:22:01,962 --> 00:22:02,503
How?

240
00:22:03,303 --> 00:22:03,643
When?

241
00:22:03,663 --> 00:22:11,086
If you could give us just some more information on the resource area on the property.

242
00:22:12,966 --> 00:22:13,847
Thanks, Caroline.

243
00:22:13,867 --> 00:22:17,388
I also would note that we need the DEP data sheets as well.

244
00:22:20,049 --> 00:22:20,349
Sure.

245
00:22:20,749 --> 00:22:22,730
Yeah, I have to

246
00:22:24,383 --> 00:22:25,624
I thought I would have included that.

247
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:26,384
I apologize.

248
00:22:26,825 --> 00:22:32,128
I want to say it was, what's her name, Maureen over at Norse Environmental, I believe flagged them.

249
00:22:33,469 --> 00:22:35,430
I will definitely confirm that.

250
00:22:36,211 --> 00:22:40,694
I'm not 100% certain who flagged them.

251
00:22:40,914 --> 00:22:44,856
But someone flagged them, but I'll definitely provide that information.

252
00:22:44,876 --> 00:22:45,717
That's not a problem.

253
00:22:47,738 --> 00:22:49,399
I apologize for not having that.

254
00:22:49,479 --> 00:22:50,680
Usually I put a note in the plan.

255
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:53,622
I didn't in this case for some reason.

256
00:23:00,082 --> 00:23:06,805
I note that almost the entirety of the project is within the 100-foot buffer zone.

257
00:23:07,986 --> 00:23:17,130
And in particular, there appears to be a good amount of clearing of vegetation in the buffer zone associated with the grading of the slope.

258
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:23,713
Have you quantified the amount of clearing of vegetation within the buffer zone?

259
00:23:27,607 --> 00:23:40,094
I have not, but the clearing in the backyard, there is a tree line there that will be getting cleared a little bit.

260
00:23:41,434 --> 00:23:50,999
But at the same time, the grading is, it's already pretty much a three to one slope in the backyard there.

261
00:23:51,019 --> 00:23:53,921
I'm just, it was kind of tough to,

262
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:58,331
because it's already, like I said, a steep slope in the backyard.

263
00:23:58,351 --> 00:24:05,412
So I kind of, where the limit of work line is, you know, you could see the existing 97 contour, and I just kind of went up.

264
00:24:05,692 --> 00:24:18,174
I did one for contour, so I went up every three feet until I hit 103, where I kind of needed to be at that grade to try to... There's already not really even a backyard.

265
00:24:18,214 --> 00:24:19,294
It's kind of a tough lot.

266
00:24:19,434 --> 00:24:23,995
I know that their game plan was they wanted to keep

267
00:24:24,861 --> 00:24:26,782
the foundation in Medford.

268
00:24:26,922 --> 00:24:32,626
They didn't want to do any work in Winchester, just minimal work in terms of the existing drive and the utilities.

269
00:24:32,667 --> 00:24:37,110
They kind of wanted to deal with you guys, I guess, instead.

270
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:40,892
So that's why it's kind of pushed back as far as it is, I guess.

271
00:24:48,618 --> 00:24:50,379
Would it help if I brought the map up?

272
00:24:55,475 --> 00:24:58,997
I have mine up, but I'm sure the other commission members would appreciate that.

273
00:24:59,017 --> 00:25:01,098
We're fairly familiar with this area.

274
00:25:01,158 --> 00:25:02,759
My final comment is that

275
00:25:22,311 --> 00:25:33,800
given the amount of clearing adjacent to the wetland line and the grading that's taking place within very close proximity to the wetland line, within two feet it appears.

276
00:25:35,281 --> 00:25:41,406
In my professional experience, this could very well result in impact to the wetland.

277
00:25:42,667 --> 00:25:46,510
And at this point in time, there is no

278
00:25:48,727 --> 00:25:52,028
Mitigation, of course, presumed because it's presumed that there is no alteration.

279
00:25:52,168 --> 00:25:55,250
But again, I, in my experience in my.

280
00:25:56,590 --> 00:26:04,554
40 years of experience, I have seen that this kind of grading that close to a line will result in alteration, particularly given the amount of.

281
00:26:05,054 --> 00:26:09,836
Vegetative clearing have you evaluated anyway to bring that to a slope.

282
00:26:10,476 --> 00:26:11,617
Further from the wetland line.

283
00:26:18,967 --> 00:26:29,871
So I could bring the grading, I could cut it back a little bit towards foundation, but that would require us to do a retaining wall of sorts back there.

284
00:26:31,252 --> 00:26:40,375
Which, I mean, part of me was kind of thinking that might kind of be more invasive, because, I mean, if I did a retaining wall, I'm still going to have to cut some of that vegetation, especially if

285
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,860
we're gonna put a recharge system in there.

286
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,781
Unfortunately, it's kind of crammed back there.

287
00:26:47,221 --> 00:27:04,445
So I could maybe do, you know, a retaining wall starting at like, unfortunately, maybe like 100 and have a three foot wall or something like that and have it come up to like the 103, you know what I mean?

288
00:27:04,485 --> 00:27:05,986
Give or take, you know, something like that.

289
00:27:07,317 --> 00:27:22,108
I could propose a retaining wall in the back, sort of a three-to-one slope, but, you know, it might require a little bit more excavation to work back there versus just kind of grading it out, because some of that grading is only coming up a foot in some areas.

290
00:27:23,349 --> 00:27:35,098
Like I said, it's already existing a three-to-one slope back there, which is kind of, you know, in some areas, I could see, like, where the 102 proposed contour is.

291
00:27:35,178 --> 00:27:35,718
It's existing 100.

292
00:27:37,192 --> 00:27:41,953
and the existing 99 is 101, so maybe a couple feet.

293
00:27:45,854 --> 00:27:53,515
But as you get closer to the wetlands, like the 98 and the 99, the 98 proposed contour, it's coming up a foot.

294
00:27:53,555 --> 00:27:54,775
That's 98 right there.

295
00:27:54,855 --> 00:28:02,777
So it's not really crazy grading back there necessarily.

296
00:28:04,874 --> 00:28:08,876
We thought of a wall, but the client said he wanted to try to create though three to one.

297
00:28:08,896 --> 00:28:19,443
So I did suggest a wall to kind of pull it off the wetlands a little bit, but I wasn't sure what you guys would feel would have a bigger impact closer to the resource area, I guess.

298
00:28:21,884 --> 00:28:22,965
Thank you for that background.

299
00:28:23,505 --> 00:28:25,567
I'll give the other commission members a chance.

300
00:28:28,048 --> 00:28:31,710
I think to kind of piggyback on what Heidi is saying,

301
00:28:33,859 --> 00:28:43,124
you know, especially near wetland flag 1A, you're really, you know, that limit of grading work is right up against the wetland line.

302
00:28:45,025 --> 00:28:58,031
And to put it in other terms, I don't think a contractor with an excavator would, you know, be able to find grade within two feet without having impact spillover.

303
00:28:58,592 --> 00:29:01,113
So I think the intent of what Heidi's asking for here is,

304
00:29:02,921 --> 00:29:16,269
Is there a way to pull back that down gradient limit of work such that you can leave a buffer of, Heidi, I'm not sure, like 5, 10 feet between limit of work and wetland line?

305
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:19,471
Retaining wall is what comes to mind.

306
00:29:20,772 --> 00:29:30,357
You come across this weird issue of your infiltration system just getting caught up in the retaining wall's trench drain and getting kicked out to the wetland.

307
00:29:32,668 --> 00:29:51,896
you know, balancing impacts, I think, dealing with trying to minimize impacts to the wetland over dealing with stormwater management, which I'll note, as a single-family home, this project isn't beholden to the stormwater standards.

308
00:29:52,977 --> 00:30:02,201
I'd say revising the work footprint to kind of give some room to the wetland takes priority, in my opinion, at least.

309
00:30:05,072 --> 00:30:05,372
Thank you.

310
00:30:05,412 --> 00:30:05,672
Sure.

311
00:30:06,353 --> 00:30:10,515
Just want to note that you refer to what then flag 1A.

312
00:30:10,736 --> 00:30:12,937
I think you're referring to 4A.

313
00:30:13,797 --> 00:30:14,818
That is a 4, yes.

314
00:30:15,318 --> 00:30:15,578
Yep.

315
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:15,979
Okay.

316
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:25,004
So 10 feet off that will take me to the proposed 100 contour right off the 4A.

317
00:30:26,485 --> 00:30:29,167
So if I could hold

318
00:30:30,913 --> 00:30:34,975
The proposed 100 foot contour, like, in that area there, like, 10 feet off.

319
00:30:35,335 --> 00:30:38,916
If I could stick if the closest I got to the wetland line was just say, 10 feet.

320
00:30:39,617 --> 00:30:43,338
And I put a retaining wall there, I'm sure I could work something out.

321
00:30:43,998 --> 00:30:46,679
Something like that to kind of back off if that made you guys.

322
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:48,660
You know, okay with it.

323
00:30:54,923 --> 00:30:56,703
That would make sense to me.

324
00:30:56,743 --> 00:30:57,744
I mean, I'll.

325
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:03,000
leave it to the rest of my commission for other thoughts and comments.

326
00:31:04,081 --> 00:31:07,303
I would appreciate evaluating such an alternative.

327
00:31:11,907 --> 00:31:14,209
I have a question, Mr. Marcianda.

328
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:18,932
What are you proposing to vegetate this new slope with?

329
00:31:19,032 --> 00:31:21,995
I didn't see any detail about.

330
00:31:24,679 --> 00:31:30,726
Proposed final condition other than the erosion control and the grading there.

331
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:40,538
I think the plan was to seed it and just have it be a grass lawn area back there.

332
00:31:46,027 --> 00:31:53,855
Well, I think considering its adjacency to the wetland and within the buffer itself, there may be a more appropriate vegetation there.

333
00:31:53,895 --> 00:32:01,023
It doesn't seem like a slope that can be used for playing or occupying so easily.

334
00:32:01,043 --> 00:32:05,487
I'd recommend considering something that is more appropriate.

335
00:32:06,868 --> 00:32:12,736
More ecologically productive than the long turf.

336
00:32:13,678 --> 00:32:22,250
I also see in the, I'm looking at a street view of the property here, and I see on this corner, the, the.

337
00:32:24,877 --> 00:32:31,239
the corner near wetland flag two, but actually a little bit closer to the house.

338
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:36,121
There appears to be a pretty large mature tree there, and I don't see it in the plan.

339
00:32:37,722 --> 00:32:45,564
I can't quite tell if that tree is on this property or on the adjacent property, but it looks like it would fall onto this property.

340
00:32:46,105 --> 00:32:49,806
Is that tree impacted by the grading work that's proposed here?

341
00:32:51,507 --> 00:32:57,929
Well, I can't say for certain if that tree is on the property or not.

342
00:32:57,989 --> 00:33:04,091
Because a lot of times, if it is right over the property line, we can't.

343
00:33:04,452 --> 00:33:05,432
Yes, that one there.

344
00:33:05,472 --> 00:33:06,052
Let's see.

345
00:33:08,253 --> 00:33:10,474
Charming little house.

346
00:33:10,574 --> 00:33:11,494
So 14 feet.

347
00:33:14,055 --> 00:33:17,636
I do have that vegetation kind of drawn.

348
00:33:17,756 --> 00:33:18,957
It could be right there.

349
00:33:19,517 --> 00:33:19,937
It could be.

350
00:33:21,716 --> 00:33:29,462
But technically where I'm grading and tying into the existing grades is that that must be like right on the property line.

351
00:33:29,623 --> 00:33:32,805
And that's pretty much where I'm tying into the existing grades.

352
00:33:33,286 --> 00:33:35,127
So I don't see how it would impact it.

353
00:33:36,368 --> 00:33:43,274
From what I can tell here, it must be inside that tree line scrub, it looks like, I guess.

354
00:33:44,455 --> 00:33:46,837
But just to get back to your point about

355
00:33:49,077 --> 00:34:02,307
the grading and the plantings or whatever you're talking about in the back, if I was going to put a wall, which we talked about, like I was going to change the grading back here to do a retaining wall, I would naturally be leaving the slope at the bottom of the wall.

356
00:34:02,407 --> 00:34:12,354
So if I set the top of the wall just at 103, which is what I needed to be in the backyard to make the foundation elevation work, the bottom of the wall would be undisturbed.

357
00:34:13,015 --> 00:34:16,978
So if I did a lawn area from the top of wall to the foundation,

358
00:34:19,263 --> 00:34:24,487
I don't think I should do anything at the bottom of the wall because I'm leaving that undisturbed.

359
00:34:24,507 --> 00:34:25,969
That kind of becomes my limit of work.

360
00:34:26,009 --> 00:34:26,789
You know what I'm saying?

361
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:29,992
I'm leaving the existing grade up to the wetlands at that point.

362
00:34:30,032 --> 00:34:35,116
So from 10 feet off the wetlands to the wetlands is remaining undisturbed.

363
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:36,898
That would kind of be my limit of work.

364
00:34:39,945 --> 00:34:42,787
I hear what you're saying, and I wouldn't disagree with that.

365
00:34:43,608 --> 00:34:50,033
I guess my question is in the context of what's currently proposed more so than what alternatives you might be considering.

366
00:34:51,995 --> 00:34:59,441
And I do think that grading immediately adjacent to the base of that tree will absolutely have an impact on that tree.

367
00:35:01,363 --> 00:35:05,446
It has the potential to severely damage and potentially kill the tree.

368
00:35:07,691 --> 00:35:27,455
I think as part of the work with the retaining wall or evaluating that alternative, seeing if there is a way to avoid grading in the immediate adjacency around the tree in the root zone would be valuable to preserve that pretty significant tree within the wetland buffer.

369
00:35:28,776 --> 00:35:29,036
Sure.

370
00:35:29,416 --> 00:35:30,136
Yeah, that's no problem.

371
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,001
And I'll make sure to get on the plan.

372
00:35:36,041 --> 00:35:49,228
Like I said, I'll double-check the spot shots and the existing conditions strong and make sure that it wasn't a drafting error or what's going on, but I'll try to get that on the plan so we can kind of pinpoint it where it is so you can see it.

373
00:35:50,028 --> 00:35:50,468
Yeah, thank you.

374
00:35:50,488 --> 00:35:55,691
It'd be helpful to see that marked, the location of it.

375
00:35:55,711 --> 00:36:01,214
You have the pine tree just opposite of it marked, so I'm hoping you have that information.

376
00:36:04,998 --> 00:36:16,503
With regards to impacts at the base of whatever retaining wall you end up putting in, I'd expect there to be at least some disturbance as clearing and grading to actually get the wall footing in.

377
00:36:17,124 --> 00:36:29,630
So to what Jeremy's saying, I think calling out some sort of wetland seed mix anywhere that you do have disturbance at the base of that wall might be useful to kind of meet the intent of Jeremy's comment there.

378
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:31,891
Yeah, thank you, Greg.

379
00:36:31,951 --> 00:36:32,231
I agree.

380
00:36:40,648 --> 00:36:42,749
Any other comments from the commission?

381
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:47,913
Yeah, I just have one more, if I may.

382
00:36:47,933 --> 00:37:01,742
I guess, Mr. Marchanda, if you're going back to NORS environmental for those required forms, I would think I would appreciate some submittal written narrative from NORS just explaining how

383
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:07,101
This work will contribute to the interest of the act.

384
00:37:07,201 --> 00:37:18,146
And if you're taking a note, I'm looking specifically at 310 CMR 10.03 1A3 for work in the buffer zone.

385
00:37:18,526 --> 00:37:25,489
So I would just appreciate Norse's explanation how that burden is being met by this project.

386
00:37:26,669 --> 00:37:26,949
Thanks.

387
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:28,270
Sure.

388
00:37:33,152 --> 00:37:33,232
So

389
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:47,056
Just to summarize, kind of, I will obviously speak to Norse environmental, or I believe it's Norse, but whoever delineated the wetlands, I will take care of that.

390
00:37:48,997 --> 00:38:00,380
We'll talk about retaining wall, so I kind of back off the wetlands a little bit, and then talk about potentially like a wetland seed mix or something, call out some mix on the bottom side, bottom of the wall there.

391
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,001
I think that sums it up.

392
00:38:05,502 --> 00:38:07,703
And actually, sorry, can I add one more thing?

393
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:20,031
The other thing I had thought about just because as proposed this project is so close to the wetland line was potentially conditioning it

394
00:38:20,711 --> 00:38:28,817
or having the applicant offer maybe some permanent wetland boundary markings that might prevent any creep.

395
00:38:29,798 --> 00:38:41,587
I'll leave that up to the commission or the applicant to volunteer to do that, or the commission, if and when the time comes to discuss whether that is a condition we want to impose.

396
00:38:43,068 --> 00:38:48,973
Carolyn, Winford Way is a well-known area, and I think your suggestion is an excellent one.

397
00:38:50,458 --> 00:38:51,799
We have done a lot in this area.

398
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:57,381
I think that's one of the advantages of a retaining wall also.

399
00:38:57,401 --> 00:39:05,165
Hopefully, there wouldn't be downgrading and alteration from the retaining wall.

400
00:39:06,406 --> 00:39:11,828
Do we need to make a specific statement with regard to the tree to clarification?

401
00:39:11,868 --> 00:39:15,110
I know it's going on the plan, but is there anything else that we need to say?

402
00:39:19,894 --> 00:39:22,556
Go ahead.

403
00:39:23,297 --> 00:39:31,484
I think it should be accounted for in the plan and accommodated with the modified grading to preserve it, make an effort to preserve it.

404
00:39:32,185 --> 00:39:33,046
So, let's state that.

405
00:39:33,226 --> 00:39:33,406
Yeah.

406
00:39:35,348 --> 00:39:40,632
And to Heidi's point about the retaining wall, Adam, do you know if.

407
00:39:42,007 --> 00:39:46,991
If you put this retaining wall in, are you going to be putting in stairs to access the base of it as well?

408
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:49,372
Or is it just going to be access from the top?

409
00:39:49,412 --> 00:39:57,118
Because whether or not there's stairs incorporated in this is going to have an impact on creep over the future, as Caroline's saying.

410
00:39:57,918 --> 00:39:58,158
Sure.

411
00:39:58,198 --> 00:40:04,643
So what I was thinking of proposing was the retaining wall, but then putting a fence on top of the retaining wall.

412
00:40:05,853 --> 00:40:13,204
And if I put a fence, so basically that would act as the limit of work to protect the resource area, but also if you guys.

413
00:40:13,871 --> 00:40:30,462
You were talking about maybe putting in markers or something like that where maybe on the wooden posts on the, just say you did a wooden post fence with wire or whatever you were going to do on top of the retaining wall, you could probably put some plaques if you really wanted to require that.

414
00:40:30,862 --> 00:40:33,804
Or you could put it on the bottom of the wall towards wetlands, whatever.

415
00:40:33,904 --> 00:40:42,070
But if it was a retaining wall and you had a fence without access to the lower 10 feet to the wetlands, then it kind of acts as a barrier.

416
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:52,538
I guess that probably make people happy with that.

417
00:40:53,439 --> 00:40:54,380
Thank you, Commissioner.

418
00:40:55,180 --> 00:41:02,386
If that is all, I'd like to come back to the member of the public that is attending.

419
00:41:02,766 --> 00:41:10,913
And if you would like to ask a question or make a comment, please, if you could again state your name and address for the record, I'd appreciate it.

420
00:41:21,627 --> 00:41:27,772
Hello, this is Anne M. Warren Malatesta, M-A-L-A-T-E-S-T-A.

421
00:41:27,792 --> 00:41:29,513
51 Winsford Way?

422
00:41:32,896 --> 00:41:33,476
Yes, thank you.

423
00:41:34,677 --> 00:41:36,398
Okay.

424
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:44,284
That house has been in the family since 1963, but we're relatively newer owners.

425
00:41:44,905 --> 00:41:46,186
It's transferred to Anne.

426
00:41:48,192 --> 00:41:54,336
And I was under the impression that the wetland started right after our drop-off.

427
00:41:56,277 --> 00:42:02,841
And that's why we were wondering why the proposed house is being built so far back.

428
00:42:04,902 --> 00:42:08,424
It is pretty wet land down there.

429
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:17,672
And that was the main reason, I mean, why is that house going so far back?

430
00:42:18,393 --> 00:42:22,855
It's going to be out of the line of all the other houses too.

431
00:42:23,155 --> 00:42:26,337
Just seems a little bit odd, but it could have a nice front lawn too.

432
00:42:28,038 --> 00:42:33,961
But just clarification of that, where the wetlands actually begin.

433
00:42:33,981 --> 00:42:39,604
It would be a learning process for us too, but since,

434
00:42:40,302 --> 00:42:42,744
The family has owned it since 63.

435
00:42:42,784 --> 00:42:48,989
That was always known to be where the conservation land started.

436
00:42:49,009 --> 00:42:54,273
Because years ago, there used to be little incinerators right there where you could burn your trash.

437
00:42:57,936 --> 00:43:01,358
That property was graded years and years and years ago.

438
00:43:02,339 --> 00:43:04,321
But it does get wet down there.

439
00:43:06,342 --> 00:43:09,665
Just a quick question as to why they were going so far back with the house.

440
00:43:15,497 --> 00:43:20,261
As you probably heard, one of the items we do want clarified is the wetland delineation.

441
00:43:21,422 --> 00:43:32,071
I understand that tree to be right on the line, that maple tree to the left of our property to the right of theirs, if that's the tree that was in question.

442
00:43:32,091 --> 00:43:36,014
Because I didn't see it noted on the plan here either.

443
00:43:36,434 --> 00:43:39,377
I see the two front trees, but nothing on the side.

444
00:43:47,602 --> 00:43:51,765
I think it was probably presumed to be over the property line.

445
00:43:51,846 --> 00:44:00,993
And I know when the surveyors go out, they try not to really trespass, go onto other people's property.

446
00:44:01,053 --> 00:44:03,055
So that probably would be.

447
00:44:03,895 --> 00:44:16,826
We were thinking of having, I was thinking of having it delineated anyway, because I know my aunt and uncle put in that rhododendron bush that's there.

448
00:44:17,465 --> 00:44:24,630
And I thought the tree was, I thought it was on Matthew's property.

449
00:44:31,255 --> 00:44:32,596
But that was a long time ago.

450
00:44:32,676 --> 00:44:39,522
But that's, I know that rhododendron bush, I thought they had put that in.

451
00:44:47,752 --> 00:44:47,992
Great.

452
00:44:48,012 --> 00:44:48,352
Thank you.

453
00:44:48,372 --> 00:44:51,234
I wanted to ask the conservation committee too.

454
00:44:51,654 --> 00:45:02,999
Is there any maintenance, um, maintenance to be done regarding all that dried brush and whatnot that's out there to me?

455
00:45:03,719 --> 00:45:11,683
I think it would be, uh, susceptible to a lightning strike or kids out there smoking or whatever.

456
00:45:15,193 --> 00:45:22,778
I know they weren't able to do anything on that property except to enjoy it.

457
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,181
But I understood it from my uncle.

458
00:45:27,221 --> 00:45:31,764
He could never do anything out there, really even to plant anything.

459
00:45:32,024 --> 00:45:36,127
If they wanted to put a tree or whatever, that was sort of taboo too.

460
00:45:36,187 --> 00:45:39,830
It just had to be let natural even though

461
00:45:41,401 --> 00:45:52,945
The Matthews had graded and put in those weeping willows, what's left of them.

462
00:45:53,185 --> 00:45:57,967
Are we allowed to clear any of that in back, that dry brush or whatever?

463
00:46:00,288 --> 00:46:05,870
If you have a plan, you could always come before the Conservation Commission with your plan, but in general,

464
00:46:07,912 --> 00:46:11,293
we cannot permit the alteration of wetlands.

465
00:46:12,274 --> 00:46:22,877
We can permit things like the clearing of invasive species and replanting with native vegetation that is not disallowed.

466
00:46:22,937 --> 00:46:25,398
Yeah, the nine hills and whatnot, you know?

467
00:46:26,999 --> 00:46:29,400
Especially what's going on in California.

468
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:35,082
But, I mean, it seems susceptible to possibly a fire.

469
00:46:41,752 --> 00:46:46,695
The Conservation Commission's authority does not extend to maintenance or clearing.

470
00:46:47,355 --> 00:46:56,919
We hear proposals from individuals or parties that want to have a project that's within or near wetlands.

471
00:46:57,820 --> 00:47:00,141
And so we're a private authority.

472
00:47:01,461 --> 00:47:08,505
We don't have, we don't maintain or enhance or work in wetlands ourselves.

473
00:47:10,136 --> 00:47:14,099
I couldn't clear back a little bit if I wanted to.

474
00:47:16,441 --> 00:47:20,243
You could always come before the Conservation Commission with a plan if you had.

475
00:47:20,343 --> 00:47:20,663
Okay.

476
00:47:22,425 --> 00:47:22,925
Thank you.

477
00:47:23,765 --> 00:47:24,226
You're welcome.

478
00:47:24,246 --> 00:47:25,106
Thank you for attending.

479
00:47:27,548 --> 00:47:32,111
Is there anybody else from the public online that would like to comment or have a question?

480
00:47:41,005 --> 00:47:51,192
Hearing none, I bring it back to the commission once again and pose the question, is the commission interested in viewing the wetland delineation?

481
00:47:55,255 --> 00:48:03,080
Or making a site visit to the site?

482
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:10,305
I would like to have the benefit of the form from the wetland delineator first, but I would be interested in a site visit.

483
00:48:11,298 --> 00:48:15,862
Yeah, I agree with that, that we need that background material prior, but.

484
00:48:25,349 --> 00:48:25,629
Great.

485
00:48:28,091 --> 00:48:32,354
So Mr. Marchanda, it looks like- Heather, you were muted there.

486
00:48:32,455 --> 00:48:33,495
Sorry, I saw you talking.

487
00:48:35,857 --> 00:48:36,698
You're still muted.

488
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:40,361
I'm trying not to share my coughing with you.

489
00:48:42,081 --> 00:49:03,747
I would be happy to make another visit to Winford Way, but if just receiving the material answers our question, I'm curious, as this woman speaks about brush, et cetera, in that area, and the issues that we've had with drought, it would be interesting to just see what we're dealing with now.

490
00:49:03,847 --> 00:49:07,648
I think our last visit to Winford Way may have been, what, four years ago?

491
00:49:11,633 --> 00:49:14,456
I don't think I was there, so I can't speak to it.

492
00:49:14,897 --> 00:49:17,640
The age here, age for beauty.

493
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:22,365
But if it's not necessary, that's fine too.

494
00:49:22,565 --> 00:49:24,227
It's more of a curiosity issue.

495
00:49:24,988 --> 00:49:28,471
I might just make a little walk up there at some point.

496
00:49:30,013 --> 00:49:32,496
Dennis, have you been, did you look at the wetland line?

497
00:49:34,678 --> 00:49:55,253
This one, I've looked at many of the ones on Winford Way, this one not in particular, no, but we could talk to, if Adam wants to speak to the property owner, you know, we can maybe, Adam, if you want to like sort of talk to them and maybe we can sort of just set a time for, you know, if some of the members want to come by and just take a look at the rear of the property.

498
00:49:56,414 --> 00:49:58,556
Well, we'd like to see the delineation forms first.

499
00:49:59,056 --> 00:49:59,897
Oh, that's true, okay.

500
00:50:00,432 --> 00:50:05,498
Yeah, maybe get the donation forms in first and then once we have them in hand, then we can go to the site.

501
00:50:05,558 --> 00:50:07,940
All right, sounds that sounds good.

502
00:50:10,743 --> 00:50:13,466
So are you amenable to a continuation of this hearing?

503
00:50:15,388 --> 00:50:15,829
Yeah, sure.

504
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:16,750
Great.

505
00:50:17,291 --> 00:50:18,252
Thank you.

506
00:50:18,712 --> 00:50:19,173
You're welcome.

507
00:50:20,494 --> 00:50:22,176
Do I have a motion from the commission?

508
00:50:27,064 --> 00:50:38,108
make a motion to continue this hearing to our next regularly scheduled hearing on January, Dennis, help me out, 22nd of this year.

509
00:50:38,148 --> 00:50:38,768
I'll second that.

510
00:50:40,349 --> 00:50:40,949
All in favor?

511
00:50:41,409 --> 00:50:41,629
Eric?

512
00:50:42,450 --> 00:50:42,550
Aye.

513
00:50:43,770 --> 00:50:43,990
Craig?

514
00:50:44,991 --> 00:50:45,091
Aye.

515
00:50:45,991 --> 00:50:46,391
Carolyn?

516
00:50:47,432 --> 00:50:47,552
Aye.

517
00:50:48,612 --> 00:50:49,052
Jeremy?

518
00:50:49,972 --> 00:50:50,073
Aye.

519
00:50:51,093 --> 00:50:51,393
Heather?

520
00:50:52,373 --> 00:50:52,473
Aye.

521
00:50:53,674 --> 00:50:56,075
Myself is an aye, so the ayes have it.

522
00:50:57,092 --> 00:51:00,813
Thank you and we look forward to speaking with you again, Mr. Marshall.

523
00:51:00,833 --> 00:51:01,554
All right.

524
00:51:01,574 --> 00:51:02,174
Thank you very much.

525
00:51:03,794 --> 00:51:04,334
I have a good night.

526
00:51:04,355 --> 00:51:04,755
Thank you.

527
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:05,735
Thank you.

528
00:51:06,475 --> 00:51:19,700
Is that it for our agenda?

529
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:20,000
Dennis?

530
00:51:21,294 --> 00:51:45,240
pretty much we still the South Street one but I did talk to the property and we couldn't come tonight, he told me he was he was out of town but I told him about the meeting on the 22nd and he said that seems likely so we can get him on that one finally finish that off we can do that and I know I promised you meeting minutes but the last few days have been a bit of a nightmare so that was literally my plan was to work on a Monday and Tuesday and then I was in and out of the office so I apologize I will

531
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:50,819
I'm going to be here tomorrow, so I'm going to try to get through some.

532
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:57,145
I started on some and then just got way late during the vacation because there were only a couple of us in here.

533
00:51:57,305 --> 00:52:00,068
And so I was answering phones and answering questions most of the day.

534
00:52:01,389 --> 00:52:02,570
Understood.

535
00:52:02,891 --> 00:52:09,917
Just to put it back on your list, we spoke about a site visit to Sycamore Ave.

536
00:52:10,805 --> 00:52:16,630
which I just I have contacted the representative twice asking them to receive their response.

537
00:52:18,251 --> 00:52:23,096
If we don't receive a response then there's no sense in continuing the hearing on the 18th early.

538
00:52:23,556 --> 00:52:29,341
I will tell him that in my next.

539
00:52:30,502 --> 00:52:31,042
That might help.

540
00:52:32,464 --> 00:52:34,365
And I'm out of town.

541
00:52:34,385 --> 00:52:38,349
The last week of January in the first week of February so

542
00:52:39,630 --> 00:52:41,871
Ideally, we can get it scheduled in the next two weeks.

543
00:52:42,411 --> 00:52:45,352
Otherwise, I'm going to have to miss that, which will be a shame.

544
00:52:45,932 --> 00:52:47,673
But OK, is what it is.

545
00:52:47,693 --> 00:52:53,235
So you're not available on the 29th or the fifth, but you're available on the 22nd.

546
00:52:54,115 --> 00:52:54,255
Yep.

547
00:52:54,975 --> 00:53:01,038
And yeah, the fifth, I'll be on a plane during our meeting time.

548
00:53:03,398 --> 00:53:04,139
Yeah, you don't want that.

549
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:08,080
Want to be watching a movie?

550
00:53:10,719 --> 00:53:12,720
We're making sure no one's opening a door.

551
00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:16,821
You watched the news last night.

552
00:53:19,102 --> 00:53:23,164
I try not to.

553
00:53:27,525 --> 00:53:28,486
So are we set?

554
00:53:29,626 --> 00:53:30,066
I think so.

555
00:53:30,146 --> 00:53:35,989
So if we just get a motion to adjourn and I will let you know when I hear back from any either

556
00:53:37,816 --> 00:53:40,157
Wynford or Sycamore on a site visit.

557
00:53:42,738 --> 00:53:43,458
Motion to adjourn?

558
00:53:44,698 --> 00:53:44,978
I did.

559
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:46,919
All in favor?

560
00:53:47,159 --> 00:53:48,359
Aye.

561
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:49,560
Jeremy?

562
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:50,420
Aye.

563
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:51,440
Heather?

564
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:52,601
Aye.

565
00:53:53,381 --> 00:53:53,841
Caroline?

566
00:53:54,821 --> 00:53:54,981
Aye.

567
00:53:55,782 --> 00:53:56,322
Craig?

568
00:53:57,182 --> 00:53:57,302
Aye.

569
00:53:58,042 --> 00:53:58,903
And myself is an aye.

570
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:02,741
Good night, and feel better, Heather.

571
00:54:04,082 --> 00:54:04,783
Yes, Heidi.

572
00:54:05,904 --> 00:54:10,867
I'm staying away from the stuff that would really make me feel better, but anyway.

573
00:54:13,369 --> 00:54:14,690
Need you two over here soon.

574
00:54:15,050 --> 00:54:15,551
Take care.

575
00:54:16,031 --> 00:54:17,272
Bye, good night.

576
00:54:17,812 --> 00:54:18,453
Good night, everyone.
