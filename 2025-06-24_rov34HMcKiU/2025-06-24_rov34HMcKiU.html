    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2470.966s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2473.104s">And</a>  in terms of the ownership, it says that there's a different the properties being sold to one company and then there's a tenant, could you explain that a relationship.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2481.907s">Yeah,</a>  we just we just we separate them we separate the real estate is in the business itself as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2487.228s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2489.229s">It's,</a>  we actually, we have a couple different properties going on so we're trying to make it so that this moves as smoothly as possible just moving into the, the local building but we're also looking at some other properties for some storage facilities.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2620.976s">Oh,</a>  sorry about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2624.618s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2626.344s">25-102,</a>  petition for amendment to a common victor's license, Raising Cane's Restaurants, LLC. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2632.126s">Let</a>  me find this in the packet real quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2635.047s">I</a>  know we have representatives here. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2644.29s">To</a>  the Honorable City Council, Councilors, <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2648.38s">The</a>  undersigned respectfully request an amendment to our operating hours for our common vixlers license 5am to 7am Monday, 11pm to 12am. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2657.028s">And</a>  these are the amended, I'm assuming you're not going to be closed from 7am to 11pm. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2661.532s">So</a>  these are the additions. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2662.893s">Okay,</a>  so you'd be open until midnight. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2665.856s">Every</a>  night, and you would be open from five to 7am. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2669.693s">And</a>  the brief explanation the petitioners are seeking to extend the morning hours of operation to 5am solely for the purpose of accepting deliveries of product and supplies to avoid congestion associated with deliveries during normal business hours of the plaza and the restaurant. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2682.177s">In</a>  addition, the petitioners requesting an extension of the evening hours of operation from 11pm to 12am. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2687.418s">The</a>  requested extension of hours of operation is consistent with the hours of operation of similarly situated restaurants, both within the Fellsway Plaza and the surrounding area. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2695.16s">Business</a>  name, Raising Cane's Chicken Fingers. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2697.28s">Business</a>  address, 519 Riverside Avenue, Manfred, Massachusetts, 02155. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2703.002s">And</a>  we have the signature, Kathleen A. Desmond, Esquire, attorney for Raising Cane's Restaurants, LLC. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2710.464s">So</a>  I will go to Councilor Scarpelli, and then we'll hear from you, Kathleen. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2715.305s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2716.961s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2717.741s">I</a>  say everything's in order. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2718.522s">I</a>  know that we've have been there are neighboring restaurants that we've now extended their evenings to, uh, different times. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2728.308s">So</a>  to be consistent, I would be in favor of what your recommendations would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2732.631s">I</a>  think that if I can, Mr. President, the only amendment I would make is that we do, at least for the 1st 30 days and 60 days, we get a response back to as as I know that <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2745.92s">you're</a>  very close to some neighbors and having that early morning delivery. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2750.943s">I</a>  would just wanna make sure that it's not affecting the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2754.025s">So</a>  I would move to that when we get there, Mr. President, but I would put it on a 30 and 60 day review just to make sure that we're not affecting the residents in that neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2766.654s">But</a>  other than that, again, we see everything in order. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2769.376s">So</a>  I yield to the podium.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2772.839s">Great,</a>  thank you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2775.1s">And</a>  just so everyone knows, Councilor Scarpelli is the chair of the Subcommittee on Licensing, Permitting and Signs.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2780.946s">No,</a>  I'm just the most important person.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2784.564s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2785.125s">Uh</a>  Kathy.</p>

    <p>[Kathleen Desmond]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2785.625s">Good</a>  evening, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2786.946s">Vice</a>  President Collins City Councilors Kathleen a Desmond of 335 Main Street Stonehenge. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2792.731s">I'm</a>  here today with Julie Dreier, area leader of the Medford, uh, location and Sarah Holmes is also on zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2799.497s">The</a>  property development manager with raising canes. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2802.699s">Um</a>  the petition before you request is indicated both an extension the hours of operation in the morning and the <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2812.067s">to</a>  11 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2813.267s">We're</a>  not seeking to extend it from 5 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2815.728s">to</a>  11 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2817.249s">The</a>  extension is only a window in the morning from 5 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2820.77s">to</a>  7 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2821.87s">for</a>  purposes of facilitating delivery of product to the restaurant prior to the normal business hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2827.972s">Under</a>  the terms of the current ordinance, deliveries aren't permitted prior to 7 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2832.773s">due</a>  in part to the loading restrictions set forth in the special permit that requires a smaller truck to accommodate the designated loading area and in part <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2841.516s">based</a>  on the distribution routes in the greater Boston area associated with the smaller trucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2846.238s">Deliveries</a>  over the course of the last 10 months have been arriving between 10.30 and 12 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2852.301s">when</a>  the restaurant is open. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2854.021s">This</a>  has created a significant disruption to the operation of the restaurant as it's open at that time and it distracts from the staff's attention to customer service and also preparing food at a busy time of the day, one of their busier times of the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2870.408s">Typically,</a>  in this instance, in terms of disruption to the neighborhood, deliveries are made once per day by that truck, so there'll only be one truck coming in with deliveries, and those deliveries are made <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2882.652s">five</a>  days out of seven days of the week. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2885.233s">The</a>  truck is a smaller truck than a typical semi, which is 55 to 56 feet long. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2891.716s">This</a>  is roughly 33 to 36 feet long. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2894.917s">It's</a>  like one of the double FedEx trucks, so it's a much smaller truck. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2899.72s">In</a>  addition, at the time we were before you on the special permit, you had requested at that time that we'd make every effort to have our trucks come in through Commercial Street rather than to come out onto Felsway. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2911.845s">And</a>  speaking with my client, it's my understanding that that is in fact the case and that that is what has been occurring. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2918.62s">If</a>  approved, my client is more than happy also to <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2922.146s">to</a>  a condition that agrees that the trucks won't idle during delivery and those those trucks will be shut off. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2929.211s">It</a>  would really be helpful and make the whole process disruptive if they were able to have this five to seven window just for purposes of delivery. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2938.937s">The</a>  second request is to extend the evening hours of operation by one hour to 12am. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2944.41s">I</a>  understand that there are some restaurants who have moved to one. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2948.214s">We</a>  may be back at some point in order to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2950.636s">I</a>  think at this point, they'd like to try out how the 12 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2954.819s">works</a>  for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2955.46s">As</a>  Councilor Schiappelli has indicated, Dave's Hot Chicken, Wingstop, and the Panda Beer <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2962.278s">along</a>  with Wendy's are all open at least until 12 a.m., sometimes much longer. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2967.241s">And</a>  the failure to be on par with competition puts my client at a somewhat disadvantage. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2974.305s">In</a>  closing, I'd just like to state that we believe that Raising Cane's has been well-received by the Medford community. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2981.729s">We</a>  worked closely with the Medford Police Department Traffic Unit and the City Traffic Engineer prior to the grand opening to ensure that the traffic associated <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2990.574s">but</a>  the opening was handled successfully, and I think we did do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=2993.997s">My</a>  client has also undertaken improvements in connection with the project that facilitates the overall pedestrian access to the plaza, namely the signalized driveway at Route 28 and the Felsway, and also improvements made to the plaza's entrance on Riverside Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3010.329s">They've</a>  also been involved in the community within the last 10 months, providing donations of lemonade to the public schools, teacher appreciation swag, <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3020.781s">public</a>  library, they were involved in the book-sharing initiative, bookmarking initiative, participated in the Polar Plunge, the Dave McGilvery Finish Strong Phrase, and recently the 8th grade celebration of their moving on ceremonies. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3037.671s">So,</a>  you know, Raising Canes does want to work with Medford and be of value to the community, and we'd ask that you approve the two changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3046.756s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3202.375s">affirmative</a>  what happens in the motion passes two five zero nine three resolution to address issues on Quincy street. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3207.937s">It</a>  resolved that the city council discuss issues on Quincy street in particular the rat infestation, street paving, stop signs at the intersection of Quincy street and Osgoode street. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3216.899s">Uh</a>  Councilor Tseng and I know we do have Ann Driscoll here and this has been uh tabled a couple times so um just wanted to move on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3225.021s">Councilor</a>  Tseng and then we'll go to the podium.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3228.269s">Thank</a>  you, um, because, um, uh, and, and, and is aware that we have a limit on, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3237.297s">public</a>  participation speaking time, we've coordinated so I can give you a fuller update about what's happening on Quincy Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3244.698s">And</a>  then I can give an update about what I've learned so far, and then Anne can give an update about how things are going from her end. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3255.041s">So</a>  essentially, Anne reached out to me, letting me know that on Quincy Street, there are a few problems that in summary, you've read out, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3268.636s">The</a>  first big one is a very big rat infestation, one that is at least a city hired inspector from Yankee Pest in the fall let us know, let residents know, was of a very, very big size. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3285.008s">I</a>  think the numbers disputed, but it's what we had heard, what residents had heard in the fall was possibly 1,000 to 3,000 rats. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3294.294s">um</a>  in three kind of large nests identified um one um is on a property that's currently on sale um there are two off north street behind um <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3309.835s">Clever</a>  Green Cleaners and Stevenson's Construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3315.401s">And</a>  there are incidents of rats jumping out of closed trash cans, running through yards, being run over on the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3326.351s">And</a>  the neighborhood has been quite proactive in preventing rats. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3333.77s">Neighbors</a>  have been making sure that no pets are being fed outside, that pets are being cleaned up after, that there aren't any birdhouses in use, that the burrows are being stuffed with steel wool, vinegar, and ammonia, and that all shrubbery on the private property is trimmed. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3354.541s">But</a>  with the note that there is some overgrowth behind the cleaners that might need addressing. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3361.275s">Um,</a>  that's the rat issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3363.697s">And</a>  from what I understand and can give us an update as well, I understand that a few weeks ago, there were some inspectors from Yankee Pest who went, who gave a different number, a different estimate of the number of rats who were there, but did say that there are rat problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3385.29s">Director</a>  O'Connor let me know that, <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3389.269s">that</a>  there are some residents who were contacted about boroughs being observed who didn't call the city back for follow-up treatment or inspection, and that <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3407.535s">The</a>  inspector from Yankee Pests, who did recently visit the neighborhood, met with the owners of Stevenson's Construction and Clever Green Cleaners. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3419.097s">They</a>  both gave them permission to inspect the property and that both properties are free from rats at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3426.419s">But</a>  from the rear of Clever Green Cleaners, the inspector could see rat burrows in two abundant residential properties. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3434.12s">The</a>  inspector did take note of evidence of rats in residential properties, including rat burrows, rat damaged lattice under porches, damaged trash cans, and rat droppings. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3445.886s">But</a>  in the inspector's professional opinion, they don't have thousands of rats there. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3451.249s">They</a>  did observe that the residents have been doing well as far as they can in terms of <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3460.014s">um,</a>  putting out rat bait, acting responsibly, doing their own rat control, um, but that, um, there might be some, um, some things that we can do as a city moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3473.961s">Um,</a>  the inspector also noted that some of the rat burrows that he observed were from the rear of the dry cleaners under the wood, uh, pallets in the residential backyard and that, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3487.641s">We</a>  can't, as a city, we can't service these areas with carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide unless the residents move some of their stored items. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3498.046s">And</a>  so their recommendations is that we work either as a city council, the board of health, or as a city to reach out to everyone in the neighborhood and coordinate rat inspections and services from Yankee Pest. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3516.155s">And</a>  that they would keep knocking on doors while they're there to see if they can do any inspections while they're in the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3524.481s">And</a>  they would help us put together a list of what might need to be done to control the rats. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3534.573s">but</a>  essentially think that if we can do a neighborhood meeting, maybe work with the board of health to do that, that would be helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3544.542s">So</a>  that's the rat issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3546.144s">On</a>  the next two issues, I don't have as many updates, but I will say the commissioner, DPW commissioner did get back to me and say that he's putting these on the repair lists for the summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3560.88s">So</a>  the first problem is that the street has from Quincy Street from where Osgoode meets Quincy to the end of the Somerville line has been patched, but the patching is coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3577.375s">And</a>  a lot of the patches are tossing tar onto the streets and sidewalks as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3586.525s">One</a>  of the patches is seven feet by five feet, and there are nine of them in a 12-house radius. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3594.571s">And</a>  so the street needs a more thorough repaving, and the DPW commissioner is aware. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3601.577s">There</a>  are a lot of streets in Medford at this time that need similar work, but he's told me that he's put this on the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3608.922s">Um,</a>  and the last concern that Mr. school brought up to me, um, was that there is a dangerous intersection with the need for two more stop signs at the junction of Quincy and Osgood. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3621.305s">Um,</a>  as a lot of folks who are accessing Boston Ave and Mystic Valley Parkway speed down the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3628.767s">Um,</a>  and there have been incidents where, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3633.868s">moms</a>  who are putting their kids in car seats and people who are being picked up and dropped off after school on that corner have almost been hit. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3643.591s">And</a>  so I have reached out to members of the Traffic Commission about this, but I have not heard back on this yet.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3659.276s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3661.156s">I'm</a>  going to go to Anne at the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3663.337s">Anne,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3663.988s">I</a>  think Councilor Tseng talked about a lot, but we have a three-minute limit, so I'm going to give you your full three minutes, and then you can have an additional minute after that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3674.136s">unless</a>  some but we have to let someone else speak for us if they want to, and then you can come back for another minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3678.461s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_23]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3678.902s">I</a>  mean, I'm Andrews go 77 Quincy Street, and I'd like to thank Councilman saying, for his help in this matter we've had contact several times. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3688.793s">The</a>  inspector did indeed come to the street, and I saw he was taking pictures of my husband's bird houses. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3694.92s">They</a>  are not bird feeders. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3696.501s">And</a>  actually, they're not occupied at this very moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3699.782s">So</a>  I'd have to say they're not much of a danger. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3702.423s">But</a>  there are no bird feeders on this street. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3705.564s">We</a>  have done everything we can in the neighborhood with the rats. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3708.665s">And</a>  they are an ever-present danger to our safety, with people screaming and 90-year-old women screaming as one jumped out. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3718.503s">I</a>  brought copies of what I was going to say, but the councilman has already said it very well. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3724.809s">And</a>  so I'm going to leave 11 copies over there for everybody to read all the incidents we've had and some pictures of what's going on in the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3732.337s">I</a>  also like show and tell. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3733.938s">So</a>  I brought a piece of the tar that's been spewing up on the sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3738.823s">So</a>  child or walking their dogs, we have a lot of dog walkers in our neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3744.079s">they</a>  could be hurt by this stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3748.166s">It's</a>  been so many patches, it's ridiculous. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3751.015s">It's</a>  beyond patching. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3752.236s">And</a>  the stop signs are really a necessity because we are almost in a direct line from Tufts University. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3757.978s">Tesla</a>  to Osgoode is a little jog, and then straight down to North Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3762.2s">So</a>  people trying to get on Mr. Gav or to Boston Ave, they just, it's like the Indiana Speedway. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3770.864s">So</a>  with that, Councilman Tseng did, he stole all my material. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3775.687s">So</a>  thank you for listening. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3776.927s">I'll</a>  just put my stuff over there.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3778.792s">Thank</a>  you, Anne. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3780.313s">And</a>  as a neighbor, I'm on Auburn Street, I know. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3783.495s">I'm</a>  right at the house at the bottom of the hill on North Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3786.036s">So,</a>  you know, I don't know how people are going 45, 50 miles an hour and making that turn, but they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3791.18s">So</a>  I'm really hoping we'll get some more safety and speed improvements in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3795.542s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3797.403s">Is</a>  there anyone else would like to speak on this item from the public, either in person or on Zoom? <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3802.286s">Feel</a>  free to come to the podium in person or raise your hand on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3807.41s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3809.186s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3810.747s">And</a>  you'll have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3844.66s">Thank</a>  you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3851.984s">Any</a>  further discussion on this resolution by members of the public or by councillors? <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3856.306s">Vice</a>  President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3859.316s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears I just want to thank and again for bringing these issues forward to the council and for working with Councilor Tseng on these issues on your street unfortunately we do know they're certainly not isolated to this part of Medford this term we have been seeking to. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3874.455s">work</a>  with the administration to accelerate some of the road and control measures that are within our jurisdiction and I think as you spoke to and as Councilor Tseng spoke to, to really get at the root of the problem requires that holistic approach. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3888.501s">So</a>  I think a neighborhood meeting is a really important step in this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3891.922s">I</a>  know that the road and control issue is not the only thing that you're dealing with, <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3895.484s">But</a>  it's certainly where we've been working with the mayor's office with the Board of Health quite collaboratively especially last year to try to update our rodent control ordinance to update our wildlife feeding ordinance overgrowth ordinance, and really just to show up for education efforts because when there are <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3913.603s">dilapidated</a>  properties residents who don't know how big of an issue, trash on residential properties can be that can really accumulate to a street wide problem so I wanted to thank my colleague and thank the resident for working on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3925.945s">And</a>  I hope that certainly by the end of the term we can have those three ordinances update to give our to the city administration more latitude to deal with the pest issues all across Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3936.407s">Thank</a>  you, I motion to approve.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3939.247s">Thank</a>  you, Vice President Collins on the motion approved by Vice President Collins seconded by. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3943.995s">Seconded</a>  by Councilor Leming. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=3945.916s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4069.645s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4069.925s">Do</a>  we have any questions from members of the council?</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4075.009s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4076.511s">Today,</a>  Madam Chief of Staff, was $22 million in free cash? <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4080.995s">Is</a>  that $20 million? <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4082.156s">$20</a>  million, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4083.838s">And</a>  then we're asking for eight to be distributed?</p>

    <p>[Ellen Epstein]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4087.982s">Yes,</a>  set aside.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4088.422s">So</a>  we'll use the $12 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4089.563s">So</a>  that falls in line to keep our bond rating where it needs to be and enough free cash in case of any emergency that's needed, right?</p>

    <p>[Nina Nazarian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4100.415s">Yes,</a>  through you, President Bears, I think that's a reasonable way to describe it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4103.836s">The</a>  bond rating companies are looking for a decent amount in free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4108.558s">And</a>  so that allows us to carry over that amount and also place some funding aside so that we can go through the process of distributing it for capital needs on an as-needed basis.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4121.221s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4121.662s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4122.182s">Councilor</a>  Lazzaro.</p>

    <p>[Nina Nazarian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4149.897s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Lazzaro. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4151.98s">Through</a>  you, President Bears, I don't think there's a very quick and clear answer that I can provide. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4156.545s">It</a>  would include meetings between myself, the mayor, our finance director, any department heads that we need to incorporate. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4163.594s">You</a>  know, frankly, we're presently very <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4167.997s">the</a>  budget process. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4168.417s">Um.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4169.337s">Busy</a>  with a number of issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4171.718s">Thankfully</a>  the this council has approved the budget, so that's not one of the items on the agenda right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4176.819s">Necessarily</a>  we do want to follow through with the. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4181.081s">Government</a>  finance officials. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4183.681s">Association</a>  budget book for a third budget award, hopefully, so that will be something that will be doing over the summer, but it's not quite nearly as <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4198.479s">The</a>  other issues that are taking a considerable amount of time is litigation in front of the city right now, which is being defended. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4205.203s">So</a>  I figured I'd mention that right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4207.604s">I</a>  hope that answers your question. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4208.985s">I</a>  should have some better information as the summer really unfolds at this point, and we begin those meetings and those processes.</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4222.193s">President</a>  Bears, if I may?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4223.173s">You</a>  have the floor.</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4227.252s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4229.634s">I</a>  just wanted to, as important as I think it may be to continue working on a budget book, I think that prioritizing, putting additional amounts of free cash into further helping the city invest in its <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4255.696s">our</a>  department beyond appliances, I think, would be something I would encourage the administration to look into with greater urgency and haste. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4269.368s">I've</a>  been <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4271.899s">talking,</a>  I feel like I've been asking for the dive equipment in a little bit of an annoying way. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4284.848s">And</a>  I'm kind of OK with that, I guess. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4288.05s">But</a>  I think that we have the capacity to invest in that and appliances at the same time, perhaps, because it's not a huge amount of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4300.559s">think</a>  that even if there was one person that was saved from drowning by a dive team over the course of 10 years, it would have been worth $125,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4310.502s">And</a>  that delaying it isn't necessary or something that I would think is pertinent or useful for the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4325.386s">I'm</a>  putting that out there for now. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4328.347s">I</a>  would also say that listing two times now over the last two meetings how many items we need to spend money on for the benefit of the city council and for the public while useful is highlighting that some of these items are a few <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4354.783s">tens</a>  of thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars, and some of these items are hundreds of millions of dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4361.886s">So</a>  it really puts into stark contrast <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4366.13s">which</a>  items we're capable of paying for now and which items we are not capable of paying for now. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4372.073s">My</a>  understanding is best practice is to have five to 7% of your annual budget in cash reserves. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4381.298s">$20</a>  million is not five to 7% of our annual budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4387.401s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4389.902s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4390.382s">Vice</a>  President Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4392.923s">Oh,</a>  there you go.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4396.107s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4398.007s">Thank</a>  you for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4400.708s">I</a>  just wanted to, for the benefit of the public, and since we're talking about this again, wanted to restate something that was brought up at our last meeting about free cash appropriations, kind of to piggyback off of what Councilor Lazzaro was just saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4414.571s">For</a>  myself, I think, and I know this is in the queue of projects that the administration is planning to work on over the summer, I think it would be very, very useful <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4422.652s">to</a>  see at least a prioritization plan that deals with these kind of separate tiers of spending projects separately, like Councilor Lazzaro was saying, we know there are some projects that are very, very impactful, that are small dollars compared to some of these multi, multi-million dollar capital expenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4442.23s">I</a>  don't know for myself and apparently I'm not the only council and I know that they're members of the public saying, if this is, you know, point 5% of our operating budget or very very small percent of what we ought to have in cash reserves, what is the justification for not spending it especially if it's something that would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4457.949s">materially</a>  useful to the residents in the short term. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4461.094s">So</a>  I understand we don't have that information today, but as we continue to talk more about this over the summer and hopefully look at a more discreet plan by the end of the summer, I'll be really, I just want to restate, I'll be really eager to see that plan for <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4475.373s">essentially,</a>  what are we going to see the plan for the appropriations and do that prioritization and filtering action through all of these plans, we know all the stuff that we plan to spend money on, I think people and myself, at least very eager to see what is the justification for what we're holding back on. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4490.501s">And</a>  for those smaller things that are easier to spend on and get in motion, what is the justification for pulling the trigger this year, next year in two years in five years? <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4499.045s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4501.647s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4502.367s">Chief</a>  of Staff Nazarian.</p>

    <p>[Nina Nazarian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4504.163s">Just</a>  to comment broadly and briefly on Councilor Lazzaro's comments and Councilor Collins' comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4510.606s">I</a>  think largely we're discussing some of the things we discussed at the June 10th meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4514.888s">And</a>  I wanna just tell the council that the comments are heard and the comments are taken back and we will be working on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4522.311s">I</a>  don't disagree largely that we have a stark contrast as Councilor Lazzaro stated in terms of <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4529.915s">You</a>  know, some of our smaller amounts, some of our maybe maybe medium sized amounts and some of the things that are just so large that they're so difficult to fund and complete and require you know multi year planning. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4543.604s">I</a>  don't want anyone to be under the impression that the budget book is is taking a priority over this I was just simply mentioning that we're on the significant downhill slope of the FYI 26 budget, and it's just a process and and that process is one for transparency, as the council knows <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4560.481s">government</a>  finance officials, association rates communities who submit their budget books for purposes of transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4566.647s">The</a>  city won the budget award in two years, one was last year and one was a number of years ago, and it's important that we continue those things because we want to continue having a transparent budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4581.4s">Those</a>  are my only comments, and I hear the council's comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4584.261s">I</a>  won't dive into each of them specifically. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4587.141s">I</a>  need to stop using that word, but I do want you all to know that I hear you and we are working on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4594.643s">It</a>  is just a little bit more complicated than it sometimes seems on the surface.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4600.164s">Thank</a>  you, Madam Chief of Staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4601.364s">Any</a>  further discussion by members of the Council? <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4605.045s">Seeing</a>  none, is there a motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4609.657s">The</a>  motion to approve by Vice President Collins, seconded by. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4613.22s">Seconded</a>  by Councilor Leming. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4615.081s">Move</a>  to public comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4617.303s">We'll</a>  take public comment in person or on Zoom on this item for, we'll go, each person will have three minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4624.128s">If</a>  you'd like to comment on this item, you can come to the podium if you're in the chamber, or you can raise your hand on Zoom and we'll alternate between in-person and Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4633.154s">Seeing</a>  no hands on Zoom and one person at the podium, name and address for the record, please, and you'll have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[Nick Giurleo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4639.318s">Good</a>  evening, Mr. Alejo, Forty Robinson Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4642.32s">So</a>  for members of the public who might not be following, this letter from the mayor is requesting an appropriation of $8 million from our free cash balance, so over-budgeted taxpayer dollars, from a balance total of over $20 million for capital improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4659.094s">And</a>  as the letter indicates, this includes street and sidewalk improvements, Oak Grove Cemetery repairs, equipment and vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4667.584s">If</a>  you recall, during the campaign to override Proposition 2 1⁄2 and raise our taxes, money was requested to fund the Department of Public Works. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4675.309s">I'll</a>  quote from the ballot question that was approved, quote, general operations of the Department of Public Works, in parentheses, 500,000, including but not limited to additional staff for road and sidewalk infrastructure repairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4688.617s">That</a>  was question seven. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4690.663s">You</a>  also have to recall that supporters of the yes vote, including some members of this council repeatedly dismissed that we could use free cash as a substitute for raising taxes but you have to look and see what's happening here. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4702.135s">We're</a>  using $8 million in free cash, that's what this comes down to, or at least putting it aside in a separate fund for that purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4709.842s">So</a>  I just as rhetorically you know why, given the amount of free cash that we had. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4714.707s">that</a>  the people of our city were told raising taxes for $500,000 DPW money was necessary, and that we did suffer apocalyptic funding shortages if we didn't do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4726.013s">So</a>  this isn't the first time though, that since the election, the free cash has been used to meet city funding needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4732.456s">At</a>  a actually recent meeting I spoke at, the mayor requested 5 million from our free cash for HVAC repairs for the schools, another about 200,000 for security upgrades across the public schools as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4743.221s">And</a>  that was approved by this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4745.502s">So</a>  I view this in addition to what I discussed previously as just yet another vindication of that free cash argument. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4751.844s">I</a>  think it's unfortunate <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4753.265s">taxpayers</a>  have to suffer as a result. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4755.366s">So</a>  we can only hope that voters aren't misled again. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4758.186s">And</a>  what I think is a likely event, we see another override on the ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4761.927s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4764.208s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4764.808s">Just</a>  wanted to clarify on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4767.929s">The</a>  funding from question seven was used to hire permanent staff in the DPW. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4774.711s">And</a>  these funds, these funds aren't, as you noted, aren't being appropriated to any specific project. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4778.972s">They're</a>  being placed in the stabilization fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4782.448s">under</a>  the archaic ways of our state law, money placed in the stabilization fund can be appropriated at any time. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4789.369s">But</a>  free cash balance, which is essentially just a different reserve account, can only be appropriated after a free cash balance is certified by the State Department of Revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4798.031s">And</a>  that generally happens in March. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4800.511s">So</a>  we wouldn't be able to access the funds until that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4803.952s">So</a>  for several months, if it stayed in free cash, but in the stabilization fund, if the administration <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4809.733s">comes</a>  up with the free cash plan or makes an appropriation request, we can consider that at any time during the fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4815.856s">So</a>  it's about putting our reserve funds in a place where they can be used instead of in the free cash account where they can't be used until the next certification next spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4826.221s">So</a>  if it isn't moved, it means that the funds are not able to be used for the next nine months, even if there's a priority to use them. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4833.624s">And</a>  yeah, I mean, <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4835.616s">We</a>  have massive needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4836.717s">That</a>  was part of the discussion in the override campaign last year, but the road and sidewalk funding under question seven was used to hire staff who will be working for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4844.921s">And</a>  that's an ongoing expense and therefore requires ongoing funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4851.105s">These</a>  dollars, what we've appropriated this year and what's potentially being proposed in the future would be for one time expenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4858.789s">So</a>  that's the difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4860.69s">I'll</a>  go to the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4864.383s">Since</a>  I see no hands on Zoom, name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Nate Merritt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4867.204s">You</a>  have three minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4868.764s">Nate</a>  Merritt, 373 Riverside Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4870.405s">Question</a>  for you through the chair, just for clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4873.945s">The</a>  $22,000 for washers, dryers, and appurtenances and a stove, I heard a Councilor mention they were appliances, but are those for uniforms, or are those for gear washers and dryers, which are a completely different piece of equipment? <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4889.189s">You</a>  don't mix bloody clothes with <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4891.73s">turnout</a>  gear. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4892.911s">So</a>  just for the public's knowledge.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4895.311s">I</a>  do believe we have the fire chief who's raised his hand so I will take the fire chief on zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4899.553s">Chief</a>  Evans.</p>

    <p>[Todd Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4905.315s">Hi,</a>  thank you for your question. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4907.056s">I</a>  appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4908.537s">So</a>  those are washer and dryers for the individuals that are working at the time to wash uniforms that have been soiled in the course of doing their duties at work. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4918.26s">You</a>  know getting <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4920.904s">anything</a>  possibly on the uniforms from carcinogens to blood or anything like that, that they don't want to be taking home to their families. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4928.268s">So</a>  they can wash those particular clothing, uh, in those washes and dryers at the stations.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4939.214s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4941.075s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4942.556s">We're</a>  asking for a regular washing machines for the stations, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4947.436s">It's</a>  not, it's not for the turnout gear. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4949.616s">I</a>  think you're confusing us chief.</p>

    <p>[Todd Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4953.097s">That</a>  is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4953.797s">It's</a>  not turnout gear. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4954.858s">It's</a>  the, it's the uniforms that they wear regularly in the station. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4959.439s">Otherwise</a>  from, you know, uh, the turnout gear is for fighting fires itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4963.84s">And</a>  the uniform is just going to medical calls and, and every other type of call that they go out throughout the day.</p>

    <p>[Nate Merritt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4971.465s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4972.405s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4973.445s">Thank</a>  you for clarifying. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4974.226s">Only</a>  in that just for general public who isn't in the fire service doesn't necessarily understand that, hey, these guys are just trying to wash their clothes. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4980.087s">Why</a>  are we spending 22 grand? <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4982.287s">It's</a>  because of what the chief said. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4984.327s">So</a>  my other question, and it relates to a different ask of the mayor, but to my predecessor's point, there's an ask to transfer $267,000 from the DPW and highway budget to other parts of the salary. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5000.528s">But</a>  yet when you total up all the line items, but yet we're saying that we have shovel, you know, like needs now for DPW. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5007.39s">So</a>  I guess I question like, what is going on that half the override ask is now asking to be transferred to different areas of the budget.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5015.332s">So</a>  that's the next paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5017.113s">So</a>  we'll take it up on the next paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5021.394s">I</a>  have Councilor Leming, then Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Leming.</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5026.9s">Yeah,</a>  I'm gonna just repeat a lot of points, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5028.821s">There's</a>  a lot of people here that are trying to talk about a couple of other papers we have, and I feel like we've gone over the civics lesson a few dozen times in council by now, but I'm just gonna repeat the point. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5042.05s">Free</a>  cash is used for one-time expenses, capital projects, which is what is on this paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5050.676s">The</a>  override, <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5053.694s">believe</a>  we're talking about question seven, which put $500,000 a year to the DPW that is used for ongoing expenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5061.399s">You</a>  can't dip into free cash to pay staff because those are year to year costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5067.123s">Now</a>  every city has usually between usually over budgets by about three to 5%. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5072.707s">And</a>  then that is then put into free cash, which then can then collect over time so that we can then put <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5078.395s">that</a>  amount into things like sidewalks, HVAC systems, one-time capital projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5085.858s">The</a>  override didn't go towards that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5088.579s">That's</a>  going towards hiring three in-house road repair crew members. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5094.181s">I</a>  feel like there's probably a lot of folks in this room who haven't heard us have this same conversation literally dozens of times by now, but I just want to clarify that that's what's going on here. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5104.346s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5105.086s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5105.526s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5108.947s">to</a>  the constituents that spoke or anybody else that's here, your time is respected. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5114.031s">So</a>  if any time you come to that podium, the time isn't wasted. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5117.734s">We</a>  understand there's other things on the agenda, but what you say is just as important as anybody else here. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5123.658s">So</a>  whether we have to say it 30 times or under times, that's your podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5127.821s">So</a>  feel free to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5129.47s">And</a>  I think that the question keeps coming about because of the confusion, Mr. President, that we had. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5135.574s">And</a>  I don't want to make this any longer than it has to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5140.356s">But</a>  if we can ask the chief of staff, really, for the clarity with what happened during the budget meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5146.32s">Just</a>  so you know, the mayor did speak, but before the mayor, Tim McGibbon <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5150.822s">mentioned</a>  that the DPW directed mentioned that we are not looking at a specific identified sidewalk and road repair team. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5160.687s">What</a>  we're doing is we're spreading that that money from the override to 20% for different departments to maintain the street services. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5170.252s">So</a>  I think the confusion comes in if we can have a report <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5173.567s">that</a>  the override in that question said $500,000 for street repair and sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5180.29s">I</a>  think the mayor made mention of it that evening as well, that we were creating a team, we were training them, making sure they have the right equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5187.595s">And</a>  that's what people thought we were doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5189.936s">We</a>  thought we were having a separate sidewalk and pothole crew. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5194.619s">So</a>  I think that's where the confusion comes in. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5196.3s">So</a>  if my colleague is offended, I think that might clarify some issues if we can have a report maybe at our next meeting in a few weeks, just to understand where that is. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5205.866s">Because</a>  that's why it keeps coming back up. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5207.827s">I</a>  think people are confused that <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5209.548s">you</a>  know, myself included. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5210.668s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5211.769s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5212.209s">And</a>  I just want to note, and I'll go to the chief of staff, but I don't, but what Commissioner McGivern said was there was a 20% increase in the budget staffing for the highway department. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5223.092s">And</a>  then the appropriation that we approved in November, it was specifically to hire the highway crew. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5230.755s">And</a>  what he said was, <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5232.375s">that</a>  because of this increase we will be able to have a crew using the new equipment that has been purchased as well out four days a week instead of two days per week so we would not be outsourcing sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5246.509s">That</a>  is what he said and I've talked to him about it about six times but I'll let the Chief of Staff continue on that.</p>

    <p>[Nina Nazarian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5254.646s">I</a>  do think there has been some confusion on this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5257.727s">I</a>  specifically recall the 20% that the DPW commissioner mentioned to refer to a 20% increase in production, essentially putting a new crew out on the street, three individuals, and that is what we are doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5274.894s">So</a>  I wanna be very clear about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5283.352s">And</a>  I'd further clarify to just say, and I can distribute this information if it's helpful, at some point when we came before this council to have <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5294.984s">further</a>  appropriations in FY25 approved by this council, that $500,000 was broken out into very distinct categories. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5303.568s">If</a>  the council will recall, it discussed personnel, and that was for three members to be hired. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5311.092s">So</a>  the DPW crew, specifically the highway department crew, expanded by three full-time equivalents. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5317.775s">In</a>  other words, three 40-hour-a-week employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5321.637s">and</a>  it also included health insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5323.858s">It</a>  also included capital because, you know, there is the obvious that when we hire a new crew, we're going to need new vehicles to go along with that crew to make it fully functional. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5336.121s">So</a>  again, if that information is needed, I'm happy to distribute it again to the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5340.822s">I'm</a>  sure it's in the council's packet. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5342.622s">If</a>  someone wants to look back, I just, I think it was in the fall, October, November.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5347.13s">like</a>  I thank you just very simple just for the next meeting if we could just get a breakdown with I know the spreader with the spreader was was purchased that we were training we're hiring three new people they were that's what the that's what the impression that a lot of people had so if we could just get a breakdown that we have that crew in the next meeting when that crew will start when they'll be trained and have we use that spreader to make to do that thank you</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5372.963s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5373.463s">Is</a>  there anyone else who would like to speak in public participation who hasn't yet spoken? <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5379.889s">Seeing</a>  none, I will go to Mr. Merritt. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5381.73s">You</a>  have another minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5383.252s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5434.671s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5436.532s">Any</a>  further discussion on the motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5440.373s">There's</a>  a motion to approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5447.726s">Any</a>  further discussion on the motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5448.946s">Seeing</a>  none, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Nina Nazarian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5563.384s">Thank</a>  you very much, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5565.345s">As</a>  the council knows, every year it's customary in cities and towns for there to be transfers for the fiscal year end. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5573.31s">It's</a>  when one budget requires more funding than another budget was anticipated to require, and it's a common practice. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5582.917s">It's</a>  one that I've seen in every community I've worked in, and I'm happy to answer any questions on any specific lines that the council would like information on.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5591.102s">Thank</a>  you just to the point could you explain how there was a $500,000 allocation for the fiscal year for DPW, but then because of the union contract positions had to be made available within the union. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5604.207s">So</a>  all of that had to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5606.309s">And</a>  then the positions, the three new positions have been advertised, but for most of this year, they were empty. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5612.494s">Is</a>  that the explanation for why funds are being transferred from that budget?</p>

    <p>[Nina Nazarian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5617.519s">So</a>  I think there are two distinct issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5620.922s">I</a>  think you're absolutely correct, President Bears, that because of the override funding, <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5628.709s">and</a>  because of the union contract, in order for the city to actually hire these positions that it set out and outlined in the document I described earlier, we are required to internally post those positions amongst DPW employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5646.161s">They</a>  have the first dibs at those positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5648.622s">So</a>  if somebody is in a, let's say, a lower ranking position and wants to seek a promotion, can actually apply and has a first cut at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5657.168s">before</a>  the position is publicly advertised, that's a requirement under the collective bargaining agreement and one we have a legal obligation to maintain. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5665.49s">In</a>  that process, there's typically a domino effect. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5667.951s">Just</a>  as if there is a vacancy in the department, the positions posted internally, because that vacancy may be a position that's greater than positions other members of the department hold, then there's almost always a domino effect, unless the position is, let's say, the lowest paid position in the department. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5686.695s">An</a>  internal employee applies for the position. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5689.717s">If</a>  they're qualified and if a variety of factors that put them into the proper place allows the city to award a position to them, we will. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5700.024s">And</a>  that's exactly what happened with these three positions for the override. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5704.607s">the</a>  positions were posted, the internal candidates applied. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5709.128s">Usually</a>  there's a lot of internal applicants, which is excellent. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5712.889s">Internal</a>  applicants applied, we then hired from within, which then meant that there was vacancies in the positions in which those individuals left, which also can have further domino effects on the department because then those individuals may be taking positions where there are individuals who are lower than them. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5730.555s">I</a>  think you all get the picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5732.616s">But</a>  I don't believe that that really is directly related to the funding here as it relates to the DPW expenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5742.215s">Largely,</a>  I think the <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5745.86s">Sometimes</a>  the easiest way to say this is that some of our larger departments tend to be the departments that sometimes might have additional funding left over in them. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5755.563s">For</a>  instance, where we have this scenario where we are hiring from within and then there's vacancies, that vacancy is what I like to call a float. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5766.046s">A</a>  float is essentially available dollars in the budget because <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5770.948s">we</a>  didn't have the position filled or it was taking time to go through a filling procedure. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5776.211s">I</a>  don't know if that directly answers the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5777.692s">It</a>  was a little hard to hear the question from my angle, but I'm happy to get any clarification.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5782.956s">That's</a>  fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5783.456s">I</a>  just wanted to go through the process of filling those positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5788.019s">Do</a>  we have questions from the Council on the transfers? <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5790.741s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5792.762s">I</a>  think that this goes hands in hands with the Chief of Staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5795.584s">I</a>  think that one question that I had related to free cash, but <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5799.6s">Then</a>  with the transfer, I know that last year we used excess funds from 2025 budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5809.005s">We</a>  replenished free cash, I believe it was $9 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5811.506s">Are</a>  we using any monies to replenish to go back into free cash this time around?</p>

    <p>[Nina Nazarian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5819.428s">President</a>  Bears through you to Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5821.749s">I</a>  mean, that's a question I can't fully answer at this time, but undoubtedly the answer is going to be yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5826.771s">It's</a>  not that we're attempting to replenish anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5829.733s">It's</a>  because best practices and municipal government are such that we are required, as you know, to present a balanced budget to this council, which in order to maintain a balanced budget throughout the year, <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5843.839s">best</a>  practices in municipal budgeting require that we actually budgeted conservatively so we, you know, our, our finance director who's on the line who is welcome to chime in on any of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5854.123s">He's</a>  responsible to go through a process to do estimates on a number of different things and by the way that it works. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5861.626s">The</a>  ability to look back is actually basically two years back. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5865.388s">So</a>  when we're building the FY 26 budget as an example, we're actually looking back to 24 actuals. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5872.371s">We</a>  don't have 25 actuals yet because 25 hasn't closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5875.933s">And</a>  so to get back to your specific question, Councilor Scarapelli, we don't, in fact, know exactly where FY 25 is going to close at and what those numbers will look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5884.918s">We'll</a>  know that better once we get closer to the middle of the summer and we're starting to close the books. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5890.443s">But</a>  again, I defer to our finance director if he has further commentary.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5893.466s">And</a>  just a follow-up with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5895.187s">I</a>  know my colleagues like to say that using free cash for operating costs is a no-go, and we understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5905.632s">It's</a>  true that free cash comes from unfilled positions as well, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5910.898s">That</a>  comes from operation costs as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5913.661s">So</a>  I think that's where another time that people get really confused when some councils start banging their head and start saying that you can't use operating costs to pay free cash to pay operating costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5925.293s">But</a>  for that one time at the time, <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5927.596s">the</a>  objective was since we're putting free cash from unfunded salaries or unfilled positions that that was that's being used I think that was that's a clarifying point not nothing to answer but that's just a clarifying point that as we see now and you're looking at different salary pieces being being shifted um you could see when that happens and I appreciate the answer that we won't know the 25 until some time but at least we know that that we because I know that people get nervous even at <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5956.258s">$12</a>  million, you know where I stand with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5958.681s">I</a>  think that's plenty, especially with those two factors, which is the bond rating. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5963.367s">But</a>  I also want to make sure that if there is some more free cash coming to fill that need, that we can be able to spend it on capital needs as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5971.376s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Nina Nazarian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5972.19s">Sure,</a>  thank you, and I'm not sure you're looking for this comment, but I'll, President Bears, through you, if I may, you know, it's not just, I think, the members of the council who say that, it's myself as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5986.595s">As</a>  an individual who's been trained municipally, who's been working in this field for the last, I don't know, close to 18 years now, I can tell you that that's also a best practice. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=5997.639s">Bond</a>  rating agencies do not like to see municipalities use <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6002.06s">one-time</a>  funds to fund operating costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6003.941s">It's</a>  just a matter of fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6005.221s">And</a>  I just say that because it's just something that's come up over and over again. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6009.822s">And</a>  frankly, Medford was, I don't, yeah, I won't go into the long history, but we are out of that place and we don't want to get back to that place. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6018.124s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6019.745s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6020.825s">Any</a>  further comments or questions by members of the council on this paper? <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6026.967s">Vice</a>  President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6155.941s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6156.221s">Five</a>  in the affirmative, one in the negative, one absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6158.342s">The</a>  motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6161.105s">25108</a>  submitted by Mayor Breanna Lungo-Koehn, establishing transfer funds to Medford Public Schools Special Purpose Override Stabilization Fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6168.488s">We've</a>  discussed this at several meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6171.469s">On</a>  November 5, Question 8 was approved for fiscal 25 Medford Public Schools in the amount of $4 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6179.432s">Based</a>  on the outcome of negotiations with union partners, when negotiated payments will be due, <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6184.454s">The</a>  schools anticipate having a balance at the end of fiscal 25. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6187.136s">We</a>  are requesting to segregate that balance in a special account to ensure the full amount of the override for fiscal 25 is available to MPS for contractual requirements in future years. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6197.783s">The</a>  special account will be used solely for school purposes as outlined in question 8. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6201.545s">In</a>  particular, Chapter 40, Section 5B of the General Law stipulates that cities and towns and districts may create one or more stabilization funds and appropriate any amount to the funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6210.212s">Creation</a>  of a special purpose stabilization fund requires a two-thirds vote, and appropriation of monies into and out of the fund requires a majority vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6216.897s">By</a>  taking this action, we will have a source of funding available to supplement the Medford Public Schools annual operating budget in the upcoming fiscal year and future fiscal years. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6223.943s">We</a>  did receive a presentation from Noelle <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6227.9s">and</a>  Jerry from the finance department as well as the interim superintendent Suzanne Galusi at a previous meeting talking about the plan to use these funds over the next 3 years for the contractual obligations of the Medford public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6240.47s">I</a>  know the chief of staff was just working on making sure we got the <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6243.552s">legal</a>  language correct, and that's why it's on the agenda tonight instead of at our last meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6249.037s">So,</a>  you know, we've had quite a bit of discussion on this, but I am happy to hear from the chief of staff or our school department team who is here on Zoom before we move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6261.509s">Do</a>  you have any comments, Madam Chief of Staff?</p>

    <p>[Nina Nazarian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6264.54s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6265.301s">I</a>  don't have much to add. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6266.461s">As</a>  you, as the council probably knows and has seen, we try to really incorporate as much into the papers as possible so the council has the information up front. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6274.287s">So</a>  I certainly defer to the team who knows the details best.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6278.089s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6278.469s">And</a>  just to confirm, this is creating the special purpose override stabilization fund and transferring the sum of $2,185,000 from the balance remaining in the fiscal 25 Medford Public Schools budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6292.965s">If</a>  the school team, I'm going to recognize our school department CFO. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6300.832s">Noelle,</a>  go ahead.</p>

    <p>[Noel Velez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6302.872s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6303.653s">Thank</a>  you, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6305.174s">Noah,</a>  as we brought up earlier, you know, we had our presentation brought in approximately about a month ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6311.18s">Just</a>  understanding that these funds are specifically for certain unions we're negotiating with. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6316.605s">We're</a>  glad to say we're almost landing our plane with the para union, which is one of the other unions. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6323.21s">that</a>  the stabilization funds would be used regarding their new schedules that we're implementing over at all the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6329.794s">Also,</a>  any other stipends that may be involved with this and their pay raises coming in with this new contract that they're hopefully reviewing at the moment.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  24-104-<a href="../resolutions/25-104.pdf"><font color="green">25-104</font></a> offered by President Bears's resolution in opposition to Scarametti versus United States Supreme Court decision.
 <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6612.405s">Whereas</a>  the recent scrutiny versus United States majority opinion by the United States Supreme Court enables and protects unjust laws that discriminate against transgender people in the United States, and whereas the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution obviously prevents federal, state, and local governments from passing laws or taking actions that violate the Equal Protection Clause, <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6634.018s">Now,</a>  therefore, be it resolved by the Medford City Council that we strongly oppose the Scrimidi versus United States decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6641.387s">Be</a>  it further resolved that we call on our state government to pass the strongest possible protections for transgender people and protect their inalienable right to medical care. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6650.016s">President</a>  Bears.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6655.217s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6657.46s">I</a>  think the resolution really speaks for itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6659.483s">We've</a>  seen yet another horrific decision from the United States Supreme Court to strip rights away from our neighbors and our friends and allow <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6672.972s">right-wing</a>  extremists to define the scope of what it means to get health care, regardless of what the medical establishment and doctors and nurses, nevermind what an individual person and their doctor determine is best for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6687.839s">I</a>  think this is a disgraceful statement. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6690.84s">I</a>  know there are a lot of people in this community who are afraid when we see these actions and decisions and laws being implemented. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6702.543s">And</a>  I am grateful both for our local gender affirming care ordinance protections as well as our state law protections that Massachusetts is not a state that is going down this path, but with this Supreme Court, and with all of the states and all of the people in those states who are so horribly impacted. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6726.412s">believe</a>  it's essential that we stand in solidarity with them and in just basic statement about the fact that an equal protection clause in our 14th Amendment means equal protection for everyone, regardless of what this court majority seems to think. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6746.984s">That's</a>  why I put forward this resolution and why I asked for my colleagues' support. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6750.786s">I</a>  move approval.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6752.967s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6755.049s">I</a>  will go to Councilor Lazzaro on Zoom.</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6759.053s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6760.314s">I'd</a>  be happy to second President Bears's motion and I appreciate him bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6767.54s">When</a>  Councilor Tseng and I were working on the gender affirming care portion of the reproductive health care and gender affirming care ordinance, <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6777.789s">We</a>  were told that we shouldn't do it because it could make us a target of the Trump administration, it goes against the executive order about diversity, equity, and inclusion, and avoiding <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6795.612s">Things</a>  that might make Medford come under fire. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6799.834s">We</a>  were also told that nobody had ever come to the DEI office asking for these sort of protections before. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6812.897s">Off</a>  the top of my head, I can think of six people who live in Medford that I know personally who are trans and just because they haven't come to City Hall to directly ask for protections doesn't mean <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6829.508s">that</a>  we shouldn't offer them doesn't mean that they might not appreciate a show of solidarity and a resolution like this saying that we as your local government do not support and do not stand for this kind of measure as part of your government I think is meaningful for people and I think we need to continue to make these statements during this <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6858.412s">time</a>  in America. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6859.672s">I</a>  think it's one of the few things that keeps Medford residents feeling safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6864.453s">And</a>  that's one of our duties is to do what we can to keep our Medford residents feeling a little bit safer. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6872.595s">So</a>  I'm happy to support this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6876.976s">I</a>  think that anything that we can do in the face of <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6884.237s">a</a>  justice and unreasonable decisions being made by our government, we should do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6895.024s">So</a>  I appreciate President Bears bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6898.065s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6899.967s">I</a>  second the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6901.508s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6903.789s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Lazzaro. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6904.95s">We'll</a>  go to Councilor Tseng and then Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6910.262s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6911.503s">I</a>  think councillors are at present very well, so I don't want to be too repetitive. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6918.989s">But</a>  I think this underscores how serious of a moment it is in our country and the turning point we've arrived at in terms of protecting basic rights of dignity and free expression and one's ability to live as oneself and identify. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6939.784s">and</a>  to just be happy in life. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6942.645s">And,</a>  you know, I encourage those of you to read the actual opinion and the dissent, and especially the dissent that came out from the Supreme Court decision, because I think you'll find, I think, most of <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6957.75s">most</a>  reasonable minds will find that the majority opinion in this decision was yet another classic example of Chief Justice John Roberts gaslighting us into thinking that <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6971.255s">This</a>  law is not what it is, even though the law itself says very point blank that this is about sex, and sex is a protected class in our country, which should be a protected class in our country. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=6985.506s">I</a>  think the dissent does a very good job at pointing out the mental gymnastics that the majority uses to deprive so many residents and so many citizens of our country of basic equal protection rights.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7005.117s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7006.098s">We'll</a>  go to Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7007.739s">Thank</a>  you, Madam Chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7009.92s">Thank</a>  you, Council President, for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7011.661s">I</a>  think that anytime we talk about our residents that feel that there's fear and unjust and any feeling of not being supported, I think it's important, especially when we talk about our transgender community. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7029.753s">I've</a>  had many conversations with my transgender friends and understanding the fears that they <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7034.981s">they</a>  fail every day and I think that bringing any resolution through that we can support as a council to make our residents feel that this council can support their initiatives and making sure that they feel safe I think is important. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7048.514s">So</a>  I would concur with my colleagues and move forward in your support. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7052.878s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7242.48s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7242.82s">We're</a>  going to see a hand raise on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7244.301s">We're</a>  going to go to Zoom, and then we'll resume at the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7249.704s">I'm</a>  going to ask you to unmute. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7250.884s">Please</a>  state your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Penelope Taylor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7256.29s">Hi,</a>  Penny Taylor 29 Martin Street, along with my dog and we both support this and are very grateful to the city council for taking this up and passing it unanimously. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7268.015s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7268.335s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7271.877s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7272.437s">We'll</a>  go back to the podium name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Nick Giurleo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7276.138s">Thank</a>  you, Nick Giurleo, 40 Robinson Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7278.76s">So</a>  it's very tempting for me to comment tonight on the substance of the case, but I won't. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7283.563s">And</a>  I think there's a reason for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7284.884s">And</a>  the reason is I personally believe that this holding of the United States Supreme Court doesn't have much to do with what this council is tasked with doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7292.629s">So</a>  obviously SCOTUS rulings are binding on Medford, just like any municipality in the country, but this resolution really isn't about the applicability of the law as it might affect Medford and its people. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7302.616s">To</a>  me, it seems more like <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7304.452s">a</a>  political statement, essentially, we don't like the outcome and that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7307.976s">You</a>  don't have to like the outcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7309.918s">But</a>  I'm just wondering, you know how the legal rationale right and it is pretty technical. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7313.442s">It's</a>  talking about scrutiny, which is a very complicated legal concept, you know how that has anything to do and of course is about a law in the state of Tennessee, you know how that has anything to do with what the city council <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7325.349s">is</a>  supposed to be doing, you know, and to my knowledge, none of you are licensed attorneys and I don't see any indication this our new city solicitor contributed to this resolution in any way. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7335.383s">And</a>  I just want to point out also that, you know, our city is facing a series of significant very local issues at the moment, like the zoning, as well as affordability, and really a host of other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7346.59s">We</a>  had a talk tonight about a rat problem, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7349.692s">These</a>  are very local Medford issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7353.434s">And</a>  it's okay, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7354.375s">You</a>  might think, you know, access to gender affirming healthcare is a local enough issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7358.818s">And</a>  I probably don't disagree with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7360.919s">But</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7361.557s">I</a>  think just practically speaking, if you look at just how the Massachusetts legislators composed at the moment, I don't think there's any chance it's going to pass a law banning access to gender affirming health care. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7371.479s">So</a>  it doesn't seem like what we're talking about today is super consequential. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7375.741s">So</a>  respectfully, I'm just going to put it out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7377.941s">I</a>  don't think this is worth our time. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7379.621s">I</a>  think there's other things we should be addressing before we worry about national political issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7385.083s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7389.752s">We</a>  will go back to Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7391.412s">Dennis,</a>  I'm going to ask you to unmute. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7392.833s">Please</a>  state your name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7394.193s">You</a>  will have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[Denis Dettling Kalthofer]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7400.534s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7400.934s">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7401.955s">Dennis</a>  Dettling-Calto for 120 North Street, Medford, Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7409.896s">I</a>  just want to say, add my voice to that I am <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7417.487s">in</a>  favor of this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7419.41s">I</a>  think it's important at this time in our country's history to take a stand. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7425.6s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7429.086s">Thank</a>  you, Dennis. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7429.747s">We</a>  will go back to the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7430.729s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Jennifer Yanko]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7434.943s">Jennifer</a>  Yanko, excuse me, 16 Monument Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7438.725s">I</a>  wanna thank President Bears for bringing this forward and the council for considering it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7444.708s">I</a>  feel that this is very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7447.749s">It's</a>  not that we have more important issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7451.431s">Defending</a>  and protecting our residents is of primary importance and I very much support this and I'm very proud that you've brought it forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7460.415s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7463.968s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7465.468s">Seeing</a>  no hands on Zoom, you'll have one additional minute, Micah.</p>

    <p>[Micah Kesselman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7468.749s">So</a>  the case is DHS versus DVD, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7473.151s">And</a>  I'll also just really quickly add respectfully to this, counsel, that you are surely aware that regardless of the decision of the Supreme Court, many attorneys from across the nation have actually chimed in about the <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7489.931s">quality</a>  and legalities of this decision and are not in any way in agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7496.715s">And</a>  many of these attorneys are very experienced and know from firms that don't put up billboards by highways. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7502.958s">So</a>  they know what they're talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7505.419s">And</a>  I think that it's okay to make statements about policy that will eventually <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7512.983s">impact</a>  us locally, such as this, we have transgender residents, we have immigrants in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7520.146s">All</a>  of these decisions coming down from SCOTUS need to get public pushback. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7525.728s">So</a>  I just want to go on the record and thank you guys for bringing this forward.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7537.222s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7538.602s">Yeah,</a>  my name is Madi. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7541.263s">Address</a>  is 161 South Street in Jamaica Plain, but I work in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7549.665s">I</a>  just wanted to reiterate, thank you again to President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7555.226s">As</a>  an employee of the city of Medford, but I am also just speaking for myself personally, I work with a lot of youth in the city and many of them are trans or gender nonconforming. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7566.328s">And</a>  so this will have a, you know, whatever happens will have a trickle down effect. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7571.031s">So</a>  this will affect youth in many years to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7575.673s">And</a>  so for the city of Medford to make a statement is incredibly important. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7581.056s">And</a>  I see so many young people every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7586.855s">And</a>  I work very closely with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7588.936s">And</a>  it is especially young queer youth and young trans youth and yeah, for the city to make the statement to stand behind them, especially when there are things like the signage in the church down the street on Salem Street, for them to have the city standing behind them is a really important thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7610.692s">So</a>  thank you again.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7618.705s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7619.266s">All</a>  right, we'll go to Councilor Leming and then President Bears.</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7624.47s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7624.851s">I</a>  fully support this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7627.433s">I'd</a>  just like to comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7628.434s">Sometimes,</a>  as many folks here have been witnessing for the first hour and a half of this meeting, we discuss very dry topics that are nonetheless very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7638.775s">to</a>  the to the city, transfer of funds, talk about zoning, but resolutions like these are also important because people want to know where their elected officials, where their city stands, and the morale of the city is important. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7656.372s">Now</a>  having people feel safe is very important and so <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7661.877s">It</a>  is possible that sometimes you might be in a position where you can overdo symbolic gestures. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7669.122s">I</a>  don't think that this is one of those cases. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7672.004s">It</a>  is important for people to know what their government thinks, even in certain cases where they might not necessarily have direct power over those issues, because it does affect people's relationships with their government. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7688.196s">So</a>  I would like to make that point.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7694.545s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7695.105s">We'll</a>  go back to President Bears.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7697.806s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7699.166s">I</a>  was going to make largely a similar point. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7701.807s">I</a>  think the idea that there is a mutual exclusivity to this Council dealing with local, quote unquote, local issues versus quote unquote, not local issues is a false equivalence. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7714.51s">It's</a>  not real. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7716.947s">And</a>  anyone who's been sitting here for the last 2 hours knows that we've spent about 2 hours talking about stabilization funds and school override funds and potholes and, you know, it's not the most fun stuff, but it's what we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7733.21s">And</a>  this is important too. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7735.89s">So</a>  to do both doesn't come at the expense of either. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7739.671s">And</a>  as Councilor Leming noted, not only is it a <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7746.617s">symbolic</a>  gesture per se, but it's a statement of values, and it's a reaffirmation of belonging. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7752.879s">And</a>  that's important. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7756.42s">And</a>  it doesn't come at the expense of our ability to do anything else that we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7762.062s">I</a>  know way too much about potholes. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7765.523s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7766.783s">And</a>  I would just amend to include also the Department of Homeland Security at all versus DVD at all decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7776.346s">And</a>  I will. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7778.946s">And</a>  I'll make sure that that amendment goes by email. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7784.548s">That's</a>  the decision that allows the deportation to third countries. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7790.009s">So</a>  it's a rough week from the Supreme Court so far, and I'm expecting more.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7797.313s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7797.913s">I</a>  do see we have one more hand on public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7800.035s">Do</a>  you mind if we I'll go to Councilor Scarpelli first and then we'll.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7803.637s">If</a>  we could sever if we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7805.398s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7808.72s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7809.461s">We</a>  have one more hand for public participation on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7811.862s">Eileen,</a>  I'm going to ask you to unmute. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7813.723s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7814.804s">You'll</a>  have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[Ilene Lerner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7823.209s">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7824.09s">Can</a>  you hear me? <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7826.108s">Yes,</a>  please go ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7827.429s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7829.631s">I</a>  just want to thank all of the people on the council who voted for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7835.375s">I</a>  think it's terribly important.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7838.718s">I</a>  am the... Eileen, I think we're getting a ringtone, but we're not hearing your voice.</p>

    <p>[Ilene Lerner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7850.667s">Hello,</a>  can I speak now?</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7854.577s">Yes,</a>  we've been hearing you, please proceed.</p>

    <p>[Ilene Lerner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7856.358s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7858.459s">I</a>  am the great grandmother of a trans child. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7862.32s">And</a>  so this issue, you know, is a personal one to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7867.902s">And</a>  I know what my grandson and his wife are going through at this time in history. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7874.725s">They're</a>  very frightened for their child. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7877.906s">And</a>  so am I. And for all the people like her. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7884.039s">And</a>  I'm just really proud of all of you for taking this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7888.42s">And</a>  I also think that the issues we care about and the values that we have should come from the local level, going up to the state level, and then to the federal level, rather than, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7905.997s">stuff</a>  coming down from them. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7908.458s">It</a>  should be a reflection of what the majority of people in this country want. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7913.399s">And</a>  I truly believe the majority of people in the country and in Medford want people to have human rights and health rights and no matter how they identify, you know, that's their business. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7928.643s">So</a>  again, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7931.224s">And</a>  thank you for allowing me to speak.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7937.393s">Thank</a>  you, Eileen. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7946.661s">Thank</a>  you to Maya. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7947.863s">Oh,</a>  do we have one more for public participation? <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7949.284s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7951.206s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7952.387s">You'll</a>  have three minutes, Andy.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8046.456s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8047.196s">Thank</a>  you, Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8047.856s">And</a>  before we get to the voting, I'd just like to join in thanking President Bears for putting this on our agenda tonight for our consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8054.898s">It</a>  should go without saying, but it often does not, that trans people have always existed, will always exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8065.421s">It</a>  is a, I think in one Councilor's opinion, one of the <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8070.546s">proudest</a>  achievements of this national project that we have been able to create the equal rights protection under the federal law. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8079.153s">And</a>  it is one of the greatest injuries probably of our lifetimes that we will see that being eroded. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8084.437s">And</a>  I think when we start making decisions that standing up for our neighbors, equal rights under the law is not worth a few minutes of our time. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8092.784s">That</a>  is when we begin to lose our humanity. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8096.227s">Thank</a>  you to all for their discussion tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8101.99s">On</a>  the motion by President Bears and seconded by Councilor Lazzaro to approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8109.454s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, when you're ready, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8423.52s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President, and thank you to my fellow Councilors for your consideration tonight of the proposed Values Aligned Local Investments Ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8432.186s">First,</a>  I want to ground this conversation in our shared humanity and shared values. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8436.949s">When</a>  so many people at higher levels of government are pushing for war and private gain, it's our duty in local government to stand up for peace and the public good. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8447.308s">It</a>  is irresponsible to invest our local public money in industries that profit from violence, harm, and inhumane treatment of human beings, whether that's the fossil fuel industry, weapons manufacturers, for-profit private prison operators, or companies complicit in human rights violations in far too many countries and against far too many people, especially children. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8469.863s">This</a>  ordinance is grounded in common sense, shared values of peace, justice, and compassion for our fellow human beings. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8477.717s">In</a>  this moment of warmongering, fearmongering, and rising right-wing extremism coming from the very top levels of our federal government and from so many other governments and dangerous groups around the world, it's more important than ever that we take a comprehensive approach to ensuring that, whenever possible under the law, our public dollars are invested in ways that contribute to the public good, not major forms of harm. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8501.575s">While</a>  the financial impact may be limited, we are sending a strong message that Medford stands for peace and safety and against war and violence, both here at home and around the world. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8514.719s">Second,</a>  I want to thank the city administration for communicating with me about this ordinance over the last several months and for the legal review and comments by the city's legal counsel that have been incorporated into this draft. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8525.318s">The</a>  ordinance structure is very similar to the existing Boston ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8529.32s">It</a>  would require city officials to review our city's investments to see if any funds are currently invested in these industries and make that information public. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8537.423s">Then</a>  investments would be sold and when allowed by state law, it would be a priority to reinvest these funds in supportive efforts that directly benefit our local Medford or Massachusetts communities and businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8548.688s">Given</a>  state law and the current position of our state pension board, this ordinance would not apply to our city's retirement funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8555.909s">This</a>  ordinance proposes conditions on investments in a number of harmful industries, including private prisons, fossil fuels, weapons manufacturing, and those contributing to severe violations of inalienable human rights like war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8570.993s">This</a>  ordinance does not target or highlight any nation or conflict or company. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8576.533s">That's</a>  intentional. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8577.853s">It</a>  would apply to all instances of human rights violations across the world based on international humanitarian law and the work of international legal institutions that uphold international law. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8588.216s">I'm</a>  confident that our city staff will apply this ordinance to all violators equally and without any fear or favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8595.277s">As</a>  part of my work to draft this ordinance, I reached out to the city administration and Medford Retirement System for their comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8601.818s">I</a>  did receive legal review and I invite city and retirement system staff to share any other questions or concerns about the ordinance before any future action by the city council for final passage and ordainment of this ordinance at third reading at a future council meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8617.89s">I</a>  look forward to further conversations and meetings with our city staff on this topic as I have offered in my messages over the past several months. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8625.555s">Finally,</a>  I wanna thank Medford residents who have reached out to share their support or their concerns about this ordinance by email and those who are present tonight to speak during public comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8635.601s">I</a>  look forward to more public input, scrutiny and discussion, and I'm happy to engage with anyone who has an interest in or concerns about this ordinance by email or scheduling a conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8645.566s">I've</a>  been heartened by the capacity of our Medford community to work through tough issues with respect and civility. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8652.822s">While</a>  I know that not everyone agrees with this ordinance, I'm confident that we can have a powerful discussion tonight that voices real disagreements, holds space for real concerns that residents may have, and stays grounded in our shared values. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8665.965s">Peace,</a>  justice, compassion, and staunch opposition to all forms of hate against our neighbors and all violent acts against our fellow human beings. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8678.228s">In</a>  this moment of rising war, hate, violence, and death, <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8683.294s">Stoked</a>  by our federal government and right-wing extremists across the world, it is essential that communities stand up to oppose the use of our public funds to perpetuate violence and harm. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8693.584s">This</a>  ordinance helps to fulfill that duty and imperative. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8697.928s">Thank</a>  you again for your consideration, and I motion to approve for first reading.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8710.251s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8711.012s">We'll</a>  go first to comments from councilors, and then we will take public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8715.897s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli, go ahead.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8718.039s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8718.68s">Did</a>  the Chief of Staff leave? <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8720.842s">Because</a>  I wanted to get some information. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8722.383s">Is</a>  she on Zoom? <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8724.145s">Because</a>  I appreciate Councilor Villes. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8729.19s">I</a>  know we talked today. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8730.031s">I</a>  think that <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8732.38s">When</a>  we move forward with an ordinance, I made sure that I've talked to both our city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8739.646s">I've</a>  spoken with the director of retirement, Judy Johnson, who's not here. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8744.61s">She's</a>  at a conference. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8746.311s">Who's</a>  our city treasurer. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8747.892s">I</a>  did reach out to the mayor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8749.453s">I</a>  think that to put an ordinance through, I think we have to be careful to make sure that we're making sure that we're doing what's right for our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8760.635s">in</a>  the sense where we've done our due diligence and sitting at the table and crafting an ordinance that everybody feels comfortable about. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8768.719s">And</a>  I understand where you're coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8770.219s">I</a>  think we talked about that today, but I think that as <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8776.362s">not</a>  having a sit down yet with the retirement board and the retirement director. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8784.646s">I</a>  know they're having a conversation with him. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8786.547s">Although</a>  it said that we want to stay away from the pension, the comments that he used was that it'll definitely, no matter what we put in, the pension will definitely be affected indirectly with what we're asking the treasurer to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8801.715s">And</a>  the treasurer, at another point, is <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8805.584s">cannot</a>  affect what's happening in the retirement section, so in the pension section. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8811.289s">So</a>  there's some strife there that when I talked to the city solicitor that I know KP Law has mentioned that there was some redline changes to your first request for their input. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8825.56s">I</a>  haven't heard or seen anything to understand that, neither has any other department. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8831.38s">I</a>  also, the chairperson from the trust fund, our trust fund here in Medford, they haven't been part of any conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8841.805s">And</a>  that too plays a big deal in what we're doing here. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8844.806s">And</a>  this resolution or this ordinance will definitely affect their situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8849.388s">So</a>  I think we have so many issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8855.19s">I</a>  think it would be prudent that we would just take a step back <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8858.338s">call</a>  for a committee of the whole meeting with everybody involved and then put forth a plan that will work if so sees fit. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8868.928s">I</a>  think that right now, I know that'll be important to see what the city side says with the administration and what we can do to craft that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8877.556s">But</a>  I don't think as a council, I know you've done a lot of work, but <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8882.277s">I</a>  haven't been involved in a true discussion of what this is to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8887.06s">Honestly,</a>  I didn't realize we had a gentleman come up today and said, I'm here to stand with Palestine. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8893.644s">Now,</a>  geez, I didn't really understand that this was a Palestinian-Israel issue until we're setting up tents outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8902.63s">So</a>  I think that we understand <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8906.213s">But</a>  this has now turned into something bigger than it is and understanding it more in depth will help at least this Councilor who speaks for many different people that reached out to me that are a little confused about this ordinance and how it truly will affect us. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8918.276s">I</a>  know your intent and your intent is well adjusted, I'm sure it is, but I do think we haven't done a due diligence to even move forward with any sort of a vote because <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8928.204s">Again,</a>  just like we've talked about in other situations that we've talked about. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8931.926s">I</a>  don't think we've put all the stakeholders in a room so we can discuss and understand the consequences, or even if we have the bandwidth to ask our city treasurer to look at this and see if they can even manage this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8946.874s">It</a>  might be something that we look at, you know, bringing in an outside party that can look at this process where we're asking to pick <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8956.237s">that</a>  we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8956.597s">You</a>  know, bring different, um, entities out of our, um. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8961.598s">Uh</a>  you know our investments and say we can we do this? <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8965.299s">Can</a>  we do that? <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8965.879s">So</a>  I think it will be important to see what the city says. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8968.359s">Councilor</a>  Bears a. I know we talked early today, but I think it's important that for this Councilor for the questions I received. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8974.7s">I</a>  think it's important that we slow this down. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8977.601s">We</a>  have a meeting <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8984.53s">is</a>  more structured with more understanding what's being asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8988.392s">So</a>  I appreciate it, thank you.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8991.193s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8992.213s">We'll</a>  go back to President Bears.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=8994.294s">I</a>  thought the Chief of Staff, if the Chief of Staff wants to answer any Councilor Scarpelli's questions first.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9000.397s">Chief</a>  of Staff, I'll unmute you if there's anything you want to offer.</p>

    <p>[Nina Nazarian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9008.756s">Thank</a>  you, President Collins and members of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9011.478s">I</a>  think I can just report at this point on the actions that we've taken upon receiving a copy of this ordinance in early May, that I've learned that there's at least two buckets, possibly three, that we need to dive more deeply into. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9028.367s">The</a>  retirement area, which has been mentioned, the commissioners of trust funds, and possibly other investments on the city side, which don't, <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9038.452s">have</a>  a board or committee associated with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9041.336s">I</a>  think that's an important distinction that I'm really learning in real time here because as you know, I think Councilor Scarapelli mentioned, the treasurer collector is actually concerned and has specifically asked <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9056.482s">how</a>  this ordinance would affect their work, considering that they are the custodian, if you will, for the retirement board, and they are also the custodian under the commissioners of trust funds work, but they don't actually have the authority to make the decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9072.037s">Those</a>  decisions get made by those boards and the custodian essentially is the shepherd to make sure that those things are followed through with for a lack of better terms. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9083.681s">And</a>  so I really feel like we need a little bit more time to consider those aspects. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9091.109s">and</a>  make sure that we don't put our treasurer collector in a position where they're perhaps in violation of an ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9097.512s">That's</a>  something that has been raised by both the retirement, um, uh, executive director and the chair of the commissioners of trust funds, as well as a question to me by our treasurer collector. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9108.597s">Um,</a>  so I, I, I think it would be prudent to have additional time. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9114.66s">And,</a>  uh, I think that that's the majority of my comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9118.502s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9123.296s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9123.816s">And</a>  I appreciate the Chief of Staff and Councilor Scarpelli for raising those points. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9129.558s">I</a>  do want to note two things. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9132.339s">First,</a>  there is an incredibly similar ordinance in structure and form in Boston that has been implemented under the existing state law. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9144.122s">And</a>  the redline changes from KP law were incorporated into this draft. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9148.366s">I</a>  want to note just on the timeline, I submitted this to the chief of staff and to Council on April 4th. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9157.99s">I</a>  received with a note that I was intending to put this forward in April, late April or early May. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9165.174s">That</a>  certainly would have given us the time for the meetings that Councilor Scarpelli is talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9172.904s">I</a>  received a response on April 7th that we're reviewing, I think April 19th that we're still reviewing, and then we got back comments the first week in May. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9187.353s">With</a>  those comments, I then communicated with the Chief of Staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9192.496s">my</a>  willingness to meet with the treasurer collector, with her, with any boards and commissions that were relevant. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9198.5s">I</a>  also communicated directly to the chair of the retirement system. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9203.964s">I</a>  didn't hear back from the chair of the retirement system and I <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9209.047s">You</a>  know, the Chief of Staff was working on setting up a meeting, a meeting was scheduled and then unscheduled and you know suddenly it's two months later. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9217.241s">And</a>  at that point, I just think there's a fundamental question of <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9222.775s">doing</a>  things the right way and at the right pace. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9226.438s">And,</a>  you know, I don't question that there may be language changes from a legal perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9232.382s">I'm</a>  sure we're going to hear from folks tonight that they would like to see language changes from other perspectives. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9238.286s">Passage</a>  out of first reading does not preclude that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9242.649s">What</a>  it does do is it lights a fire under all of us to actually get the work done. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9247.874s">So</a>  when I ask for the passage for first reading, that means now there's a clock that we have to keep to make those changes, to have those meetings and to get the work done. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9258.543s">And</a>  given my experience over the last several months, just with the pace of this process, I feel like that's necessary at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9266.47s">So</a>  that's why I'm proposing it and that's why I'll be moving on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9269.032s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9271.454s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9274.193s">Are</a>  there any additional comments from councillors? <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9277.115s">I</a>  know there are a lot of people who would like, members of the public who would like to speak on this paper tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9284.22s">All</a>  right, seeing none. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9286.822s">Oh,</a>  sorry, Councilor Scarpelli, I didn't see your mic turn on.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9289.644s">I</a>  know people have been standing here all evening, but I think that, I know that you want to get that clock started, President Villes, but I think we need to move, we need to move slower. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9300.151s">So</a>  I'm going to invoke my right for, <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9303.636s">chapter</a>  uh mass general law chapter 43 section 22 to delay any further discussions for uh till our next meeting i think it's important that um after listening to the chief of staff talking to the the um the um parties involved that <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9321.324s">might</a>  have contradicted what you just said. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9323.085s">So</a>  I'd rather not move forward until we have our questions answered before we listen to anybody and waste anybody else's time this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9332.348s">So</a>  I invoke that right of section 22 and end all debate.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9346.254s">Public</a>  participation under suspension.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_48]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9457.364s">My</a>  name is Claire Sheridan I live in Medford at 190 High Street apartment 110. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9464.868s">I</a>  urge the city of Medford to divest from corporations that promote the manufacture of weapons of mass destruction <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9473.213s">chemical</a>  and biological weapons, as well as explosive incendiaries and poison gases. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9481.959s">And</a>  I'll throw in fossil fuels and private prisons for good measure. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9487.242s">Some</a>  of them you know well, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, L3Harris, Boeing, RTX Corporation, the list goes on and on. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9498.269s">They</a>  are war profiteers and you know it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9501.927s">I</a>  am weary of my tax money going to these companies with no say from me. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9508.208s">Massachusetts</a>  was the first state in the U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9511.489s">to</a>  divest from South Africa. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9514.569s">Let</a>  Medford be the first city in Massachusetts to do the right thing and divest from these corporations. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9523.051s">And</a>  yes, Massachusetts does have a responsible investment act that is currently before the state legislature. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9532.326s">And</a>  by the way, the city of Portland, Maine divested, so you might as well look at them for some model. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9539.533s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9540.053s">We'll</a>  go to Dennis on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9546.719s">Dennis,</a>  name and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9548.561s">You'll</a>  have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[Denis Dettling Kalthofer]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9555.465s">Okay,</a>  hi. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9556.926s">So,</a>  yes, my name is Dennis Detling Kalthofer and I live at 120 North Street in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9564.193s">So,</a>  I think this is a very important resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9569.779s">I</a>  deeply believe that we should do all we can, personally and as a city, <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9580.039s">to</a>  invest our savings and efforts into enterprises that benefit people on the planet and not into those which contribute to environmental destruction, human rights abuses, or genocide. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9591.467s">And</a>  I think it's very, this is a lot, there's a lot at stake right now with the attack on Iran and other things that are going on, the shift in the budget to military priorities, <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9609.58s">I</a>  think that it's important that we put our money where our mouth is in terms of our investments when the majority of Americans oppose these sorts of actions. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9625.385s">I've</a>  read the proposed ordinance, and I think that it's similar to an ordinance, a shorter one and simpler one, that Northampton has passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9637.753s">I</a>  don't see why we can't overcome any legal technicalities and pass it as soon as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9646.815s">And</a>  I also think that in addition, we should create a separate home rule petition to Massachusetts to do similar divestment from retirement funds for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9662.757s">I</a>  understand why this was excluded in this particular ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9668.433s">because</a>  that way it doesn't go contrary to state law. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9673.695s">But</a>  I think that in addition, we should have this home rule petition to allow us to divest retirement funds as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9685.221s">And</a>  that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9690.143s">So</a>  please consider passing this as soon as possible.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9696.706s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9699.924s">Name</a>  and address for the record at the podium and you'll have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[nzT0OcLHmhc_SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9706.686s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears and the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9708.927s">I</a>  am Rabbi Jessica Delera Nussbaum, a Medford homeowner and the rabbi of the only synagogue in our city, Temple Shalom of 475 Winthrop Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9718.451s">Some</a>  of you may also know me as a regular warden of our polling places here in Medford and a frequent speaker and attendee of municipal ceremonies since I was raised with a strong sense of civic responsibility and a mandate to show up in support of the orderly, egalitarian functioning of our government at every level. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9733.337s">Due</a>  to my respect for the diversity of views in my own synagogue community, I almost never make public comment on partisan politics in my role as a rabbi, however I feel compelled to do so today. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9743.501s">I</a>  was awakened early this morning to cries of alarm from several of my congregants regarding this ordinance on tonight's agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9750.004s">In</a>  particular, despite the careful veneer of neutrality on paper, <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9753.985s">They</a>  were outraged that in anti-Israel circles, it was being promoted openly as a tool of the boycott, divest, and sanctions movement against Israel and as a test case for pushing through similar measures throughout Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9766.758s">An</a>  email forwarded to me proclaimed this as important BDS news. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9771.222s">encouraging</a>  people to show up so that Medford would be the first city in the state to make it easier for other municipalities. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9777.884s">And</a>  it's also said, do not share on social media in red capital letters. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9782.266s">If</a>  everything were above board here, why shouldn't their supporters proudly declare themselves? <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9787.067s">My</a>  congregants alarm stemmed just as much from this attempt to keep this ordinance and its intended impact under the radar as from the comment content itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9795.21s">I</a>  did not know that this was happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9796.992s">I</a>  had not heard from any of my contacts at City Hall that this was under consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9801.436s">The</a>  fact in and of itself has stoked fear and outrage among my congregants who are still repairing their trust in this city council after the last minute poisoned rewording of the previous resolution about the Gaza war last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9813.99s">At</a>  that time, I told Vice President Collins that I was strongly against the city council wading into international diplomacy at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9822.296s">It's</a>  an issue on which you have no legitimate involvement or leverage. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9826.239s">That</a>  was simply not the purview of municipal government. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9829.982s">This</a>  is divisive. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9831.082s">You</a>  want people to feel safe and cared for. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9835.566s">The</a>  Jewish community does not feel that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9837.427s">You'll</a>  hear from other people behind me speaking as Jews <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9841.83s">It</a>  is not a universal feeling, but I am here to tell you that many, many Jews feel like they are being thrown under the bus by an ordinance like this that pretends to be neutral, when in reality it is full of problems, logistical problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9854.893s">Who</a>  gets to decide what rules and which classifications a company will have in terms of does it or does it not support human rights violations? <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9865.895s">And</a>  leaving the name of Israel off doesn't do it because you have sketched the worst accusations that have been leveled against Israel by its detractors at a time that the Jewish community, many of us have family, friends, colleagues, spiritual, and yes, financial ties to Israel. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9885.1s">We</a>  do not feel safe when it's being treated in this manner. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9888.561s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9889.742s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9894.316s">We'll</a>  go to Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9895.9s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9898.004s">You'll</a>  have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[Penelope Taylor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9900.617s">Great,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9901.338s">Penny</a>  Taylor, 29 Martin Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9904.04s">I</a>  wanted to first thank President Bears and the whole city council for taking this up and for dedicated and inspiring organizers for getting it to this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9912.907s">I</a>  support this ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9914.188s">I</a>  don't want our money invested in weapons manufacturers or other companies that are complicit with and profiting off harming and killing people directly with a side effect of really polluting and harming our global environment through toxic materials and processes. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9931.022s">I</a>  feel like this is extra relevant on this extremely hot day, the kind of environmental impact of so many of these companies, including weapons manufacturers. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9941.309s">I</a>  do think this is an urgent issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9943.551s">And</a>  as others have pointed out, there are models. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9945.733s">It</a>  sounds like Northampton and Portland, Maine had caught my eye. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9948.294s">So</a>  I feel like municipal government to government, you can check in with them and see what's working and not and make sure it works for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9957.998s">I</a>  also just, me personally, I am a public employee at a place that I am not proud of its investments. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9965.02s">And</a>  I would be really happy if the city council where I work would take this up seriously and have serious conversations about what it means to be complicit and have our money invested in these types of companies. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9976.924s">So</a>  thank you for bringing it up and I'll yield my time.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9979.985s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9983.387s">We'll</a>  go to the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9985.175s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please, and you'll have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[Nick Giurleo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9988.656s">Good</a>  evening again, Nick Giurleo, 40 Robinson Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9991.237s">So</a>  I'll just devote my time to just putting some questions on the record that hopefully the council will be able to answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=9996.64s">So</a>  the first question is, what is the city invested in currently? <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10000.641s">And</a>  where can a member of the public get that information? <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10003.182s">I</a>  ask that because part of this ordinance is not just about investing, it's also about divesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10008.984s">So</a>  I think it's important to know what we're invested in currently. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10013.207s">The</a>  other question would be is just regarding subsection D of section 2 dash 697 so that's the part about no investment. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10022.153s">of</a>  city funds and entities that severely violate human rights. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10025.496s">I</a>  think it's a great idea, but I'm a little concerned about the vagueness. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10029.899s">My</a>  question regarding this is who determines what a severe human rights violation is? <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10035.504s">The</a>  ordinance does reference international legal community, but what entity in the city is going to determine what the international community has to say about that? <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10044.811s">Is</a>  it the treasurer? <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10045.752s">Is</a>  it the council, the law department? <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10047.997s">Do</a>  we have anybody competent to do that at the local level? <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10051.278s">It</a>  seems not something that anybody in local government really would have knowledge about. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10056.26s">So</a>  those are the questions I put out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10058.401s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10060.922s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10062.322s">There's</a>  no hands on Zoom, so we'll stay at the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10064.103s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10065.324s">You</a>  have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10067.601s">Hi,</a>  my name is Anna Meyer. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10069.342s">I</a>  live at 6 Douglas Road in Medford, Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10073.905s">I</a>  teach US history, and I really appreciate the ability to every year look at the course of US history. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10080.27s">And</a>  I think that fundamentally, we have to understand that our economy was started by stealing land, by exploiting labor. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10087.595s">And</a>  it's only then been shaped by continued ecological extraction. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10093.038s">and</a>  the industry of war. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10094.319s">It</a>  blows my mind every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10095.5s">The</a>  US economy spent more money on World War II than it had in the previous however many years of its history combined and then doubled. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10103.164s">This</a>  country is built on war. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10105.425s">And</a>  I think it's really easy to feel hopeless about that as our president starts wars with that congressional approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10113.509s">I</a>  think that so often so much feels out of our control. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10116.971s">And</a>  I am so grateful. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10120.092s">for</a>  working on this ordinance, because I think that it is a moment of calling back local control and saying that there is local money in Medford that are invested in corporations, specifically there's money invested in Lockheed Martin and Chevron that are doing harm in the world. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10137.576s">And</a>  I think this is a moment of imagining what an economy is like and what a community is like when our money is invested where our values are. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10145.697s">Specifically,</a>  I want to talk about immigration. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10148.499s">I</a>  also work as an advocate for immigrants in Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10152.64s">I</a>  want to call specific attention to the section of this ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10156.702s">That</a>  would mean that Med for Money is not investing in detention centers. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10160.664s">I'm</a>  specifically concerned about the students, college students, <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10164.686s">High</a>  school students are being kidnapped off the street and increasingly brought to for profit detention centers, where they're kept without due process where they're kept without access to the medical needs that they have they're being legitimately discriminated against. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10177.85s">And</a>  I think that it would really. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10180.271s">And</a>  I would also just name like specifically in Medford like people are kidnapped off the street last weekend and taken to an ice jail. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10185.573s">in</a>  Burlington where we know people are being kept on floors, they're sleeping there, given Mylar blankets or eating crackers for dinner. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10193.459s">This</a>  is not where we want Medford's money to be invested in. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10196.881s">And</a>  I appreciate people have already raised concerns tonight about the logistics of this ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10201.125s">And</a>  I appreciate that I cannot speak to all of the specifics of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10205.808s">But</a>  I think even though it's complicated, there's really good work that needs to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10209.911s">And</a>  I would urge city councilors to take it on as <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10214.254s">an</a>  act of good faith that it is worth this work to be doing, especially as a way of inspiring other cities and towns of looking carefully at their investments and making sure that they're invested in the things that stand for those city's values. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10225.862s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

<a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10298.605s">And</a>  therefore, do you think that that city Councilor is also a person who is a warmonger? <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10304.868s">I</a>  would say there are plenty of good people in this city that make equipment to defend people like him and others. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10310.871s">I</a>  come from a military family. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10312.632s">So</a>  demonizing companies like MIT, Draper, <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10320.102s">Hanscom</a>  Air Force Base, which employs a lot of people here, General Electric, the wording in this, where it says any company that does any weapons manufacturing, I hate to tell you folks, this is reality, this isn't utopia. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10332.448s">Same</a>  with a local company, if they're scrubbing toilets in a jail, therefore they derive their revenue from that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10339.752s">You're</a>  demonizing potential janitors or building maintenance folks that are just trying to make a living. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10346.675s">In</a>  terms of the environment, <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10348.508s">Electricity</a>  right now, for the most part, that heats our homes, lets our fire trucks go down the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10353.793s">There's</a>  no electric fire truck, folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10355.454s">It</a>  ain't going to happen anytime soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10358.377s">If</a>  we stopped all fossil fuels today, society would fall apart. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10362.1s">That's</a>  a sad fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10363.721s">So</a>  NVIDIA is one of the richest companies, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10367.405s">Anybody</a>  who follows the stock market knows that NVIDIA stock is triple. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10370.808s">Great</a>  investment. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10371.809s">How</a>  good do you think all the servers that are powered by NVIDIA chips <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10375.944s">is</a>  for the environment, the electrical consumption, the processes to make those chips. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10381.786s">I</a>  think you've opened up a Pandora's box. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10384.627s">And</a>  there are plenty of good people in this city that work for companies and aren't necessarily warmongers. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10391.249s">But</a>  now you've made it this city unfriendly for several companies and industries. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10395.75s">And</a>  it doesn't surprise me that General Electric picked up and left. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10398.98s">Because</a>  they probably saw this one coming down the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10401.201s">And</a>  if that's in Boston, where they said they were going to have their headquarters, well, guess what? <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10405.023s">They</a>  make any of their revenue from manufacturer sale of weapons of any kind. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10410.246s">They</a>  also make a lot of very good products that help people, including in health care. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10415.309s">So</a>  I urge you to reconsider the language of this and stop dividing the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10419.332s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10426.518s">New</a>  to Massachusetts I came this far because I think it's so important really important that people here got a message. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10434.422s">Hello</a>  for A4P community, Arlington for Palestine. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10438.083s">We</a>  have important BDS news from our friends from Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10441.505s">So</a>  even though you might think this is neutral, everybody here, and you can see by the casillas here, this is about Israel. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10448.968s">This</a>  is about Gaza, no matter how much they try to disguise it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10452.729s">One</a>  way that you could definitely tell is if you look at D, it's not saying that it's countries that do bad things determined by the United States. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10463.093s">Nowhere</a>  here does it say it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10464.254s">It</a>  says international legal and humanitarian. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10467.616s">Why?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10468.396s">Because</a>  the UN has been known to be extremely anti-Israel. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10473.359s">That's</a>  why they want the UN. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10476.081s">Just</a>  to show you facts, in 2024, the United General Assembly from the UN had 17 resolutions against Israel, a country surrounded by seven huge Arab neighbors, which is the size of New Jersey. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10493.418s">being</a>  attacked by Iran, by other huge places. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10498.022s">Guess</a>  how many they had against North Korea, Iran, Russia, China, Sudan, all total six, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10506.208s">So</a>  nothing, and after October 7th, when October 6th, there was peace. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10513.254s">October</a>  7th came, did the UN condemn it? <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10516.036s">Has</a>  the UN condemned the use of the Palestinian, of Hamas, of human shields? <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10521.06s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10522.21s">But</a>  what do we have time and time again, the UN is going after Israel. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10527.413s">This</a>  is why they want you to follow the UN guidelines. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10531.335s">This</a>  is why they want you to follow international guidelines. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10534.656s">The</a>  UN has vetoed 45 times resolutions against Israel. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10540.559s">You've</a>  got to understand they're not neutral. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10542.5s">They're</a>  not the wonderful UN that we had in fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10546.983s">And</a>  all of these, the people who are for this are funded as JP other places are funded by people who have been linked to terrorist organizations you've got to understand, this is not neutral, this is anti Israel, they know it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10564.263s">We</a>  know it, I really wish that you understood how important this is, and the anti Israel stuff, it's not just anti Israel, as you know, from the people who were killed at the AJC, and that the Molotov cocktails that were that were thrown in Boulder where children were there. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10582.178s">They</a>  are against Jews. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10584.179s">So</a>  this is going to be seen not as something neutral, wonderful peace, but something against Jews. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10590.56s">And</a>  the other thing, I can't believe there's a teacher here who's saying we shouldn't have fought World War II. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10597.062s">Yes,</a>  it is lovely to want peace, but if Iran is building a nuclear bomb, or if not, if Hitler was going around to kill everybody and wasn't going to stop, do you really think we should not have fought against them?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10611.102s">It's</a>  ridiculous. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10611.722s">I</a>  don't think anyone is saying we shouldn't have fought World War II.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10614.903s">Excuse</a>  me? <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10615.303s">She</a>  said we spend more money on World War II.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10618.724s">That</a>  was a reference to the fact that war is intent and inherent in our economic development. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10623.666s">I</a>  don't think it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10625.386s">Please,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10626.287s">I'm</a>  running this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10627.027s">I</a>  don't think it was an intended statement to say that World War II was not a righteous war. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10633.089s">And</a>  quite frankly, I got a number of messages today from fascists. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10638.17s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10642.383s">No,</a>  I'm saying that I received messages in my inbox. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10645.364s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10647.585s">No,</a>  guys, guys, don't engage. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10650.186s">I'm</a>  just saying, if we're going to talk about World War II, we're going to talk about the full scope of the communications that elected officials receive in this country. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10660.57s">And</a>  I don't think anyone in this country or in this city or in this world <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10665.792s">wants</a>  anyone to be subject to violence. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10669.095s">That</a>  is the exact opposite intent that I put forward with this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10673.839s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10675.841s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10676.902s">I</a>  was, I had, I received recently a death wish. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10679.144s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10680.538s">Name</a>  and address for the record you have three minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10682.719s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_32]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10683.16s">My</a>  name is Josh Lee, I live at 347 Main Street, I obviously urge you to support this ordinance and to invest our public funds in ways that let us thrive and don't support destructive industries like weapons manufacturing prisons fossil fuels and the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10698.388s">I</a>  just want to also say that disrespect of our time, our tax dollars and frankly like our collective humanity from Councilor Scarpelli is not lost on me, so the chair, or any of us, please direct the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10711.134s">We</a>  already invest our money in businesses that cause harm across the globe, we have already waded into global geopolitics by virtue of that investment. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10719.665s">I</a>  volunteer my time, I am not funded, for the city as a member of its Energy and Environment Committee, which helps the city meet its goals set forth by the Climate Action and Adaptation Plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10729.894s">That</a>  plan says, quote, climate change is rooted in a system of economic growth that extracts value without accounting for the real environmental and social costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10738.881s">This</a>  is a good ordinance, and I am proud that it recognizes the multiplicity of the social costs involved in all of these industries, not just from fossil fuels. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10747.228s">That</a>  being said, divestment from fossil fuels is an essential aspect of this ordinance and of our jobs as environmental advocates here to encourage. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10756.091s">We</a>  currently have funds that are invested in the world's largest corporate polluter in Chevron. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10760.473s">They</a>  have contributed over 40 billion tons of carbon into the atmosphere and will continue to do so as long as it is funded by funds like Medford's. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10768.68s">I</a>  also want to note that this ordinance, as was noted several times, is specifically designed to not affect a much larger pool of investment dollars, the retirement fund of our public employees.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10777.868s">Guys,</a>  let's not take the bait.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_32]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10779.109s">Let's</a>  not have disputes in the hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10780.95s">Please,</a>  let's just keep this civil. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10783.239s">I</a>  myself am a municipal employee in our neighboring city of Somerville where over a decade ago, we as municipal employees voted to divest our retirement funds from fossil fuels that divestment has not yet happened over a decade later and is not able to happen due to conservative policy from the public employee of return retirement administration commission or para I urge you all to collaborate with the retirement board <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10806.112s">with</a>  Senator Jalen, with our representatives at the State House to give the freedom that this is proposing here, to give the agency and freedom to our public employees to divest their retirement funds from similarly destructive industries. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=10820.542s">So</a>  thank you, and I appreciate you voting for this.</p>

    <p>[Micah Kesselman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11019.797s">My</a>  name is Micah Kesselman. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11021.578s">I</a>  live at 499 Main Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11024.079s">I</a>  am going to make this comment not on behalf of myself, but on behalf of the New England Jewish Labor Bund, who fully support this going into effect. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11039.148s">And</a>  then I will make a loop and make a small comment on my own behalf to respond to some of the issues that have come up. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11049.54s">Anyway,</a>  I'm a resident of Medford for the better part of a decade now, and a member of the New England Jewish Labor Bund. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11057.546s">I</a>  offer the following public statement in the context of both as a resident of our city and also as the stance of the New England Jewish Labor Bund on the topic of this ethical investment ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11067.793s">This</a>  ordinance is directly aligned with two fundamental ethos of the book, the way kite and said the way kite translates to hereness and as a sort of concept of intentional presence, our home is where we are and is also not in a vacuum, our home should reflect the values we espouse and execute on. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11084.662s">And</a>  it should operationalize these values internally and externally, because at the end of the day, Doikai is about the here and now, and also the there and then, where evil and injustice, cruelty and apathy, terror and misery are being performed upon one of our siblings and friends in humanity. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11100.469s">They</a>  are being performed upon each and every one of us everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11104.511s">Tzedek</a>  is another easily said word, but hard to define concept in actuality. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11109.808s">There</a>  is a Klezmer Bundist song of Palestinian solidarity called Dumai that sings the demand, <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11117.881s">On</a>  the one hand, this translates to the popular slogan, without justice, without peace. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11122.342s">But</a>  with a very slightly different pronunciation, on the other hand, refers to the root, tzedek. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11127.403s">This</a>  is a deeply complex Hebrew root. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11129.384s">Out</a>  of tzedek arises tzedek for justice, tzedakah for charity, tzedek for enlightened person. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11134.385s">Tzedek</a>  is the gravitational center of justice, wisdom, mercy, compassion, righteousness, virtue. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11140.126s">The</a>  greatest rabbis, all diaspora, placed tzedek and its formulations as the cornerstone mitzvah of all others. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11148.248s">People</a>  should act first and foremost out of a basis of justice, compassion, mercy, care, and a community tethered to no other axiom would nevertheless emerge a just and good community. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11159.358s">Moreover,</a>  civic across its range of formulations is necessary for peace anywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11164.001s">And</a>  a lack of peace somewhere must be treated as a lack of peace everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11168.725s">This</a>  is not just a peace abroad and lands and among people suffering the clear yoke of oppression. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11173.424s">There's</a>  also a question of peace here in our city, state, and country, where carceral profiteers leverage bigotry and terror to the terrible benefit of capital, where those with the most continue to deplete and ravage the habitability of our world simply to accumulate yet more than they could ever utilize in 100, 100 lifetimes, where the most successful and profitable companies are enterprises of murder, destruction, and misery, rather than building up the world around them. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11199.485s">However,</a>  we are under no delusion that we can simply go and bring relief to the oppressed and justice to the oppressors with a social media post pithy statement and snap of our fingers.</p>

    <p>[Micah Kesselman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11208.616s">So</a>  often. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11209.196s">I'm</a>  just going to have to ask you to hold off and come back around. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11213.421s">There's</a>  like one, like half a paragraph. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11215.824s">Two</a>  sentences and then we'll finish. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11217.145s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11219.222s">So</a>  often the demons we seek to banish are systemic and entrenched and this is a rare opportunity for a community to live up to and put into practice values of civic and dweikite just a little and through the labyrinthine mechanisms afforded to the many of us without direct and unbridled grip upon the levers of government control. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11234.613s">We,</a>  the New England Jewish Labor Bund and myself, Micha Sholom Kesselman, who calls this city home, <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11240.357s">ask</a>  that this council and city make the decision to refuse allocations of our financial assets to forces of destruction, cruelty, oppression, and the reification of the darkest impulses of the human heart. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11251.406s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_27]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11699.555s">My</a>  name is Will Sherwood. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11701.016s">I</a>  live in 30 Woodside Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11703.277s">I</a>  am a Medford resident. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11705.718s">I</a>  am the chair of the Medford Energy and Environment Committee, and I'm a teacher that specializes in environmental education. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11713.167s">And</a>  I'm in favor of divestment. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11715.989s">I'm</a>  not here to speak on behalf of the Energy and Environment Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11718.792s">All</a>  of you received our email of unanimous support for this endeavor. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11723.756s">Instead,</a>  I'm here to speak on behalf of my students. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11727.439s">My</a>  students are aged eight to 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11728.92s">We</a>  go up for the walks in the fells every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11733.559s">These</a>  are the ones that I see every day frustrated and scared by severe weather that they see on the news, by the terrifying things that happen every day that they cannot control. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11744.185s">These</a>  students cry and worry over heat waves like today, wildfire smoke from previous summers, the loss of wildflowers, wild birds, and insects. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11755.071s">What</a>  they are feeling is frustration, is fear, it is sadness, it is grief. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11759.433s">It</a>  is grief over a world they do not get a say in saving. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11764.497s">We</a>  as adults, as parents, as educators, as voters, and as politicians have an obligation to our future generations to build something sustainable, to build something healthy, to build something kind. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11777.589s">By</a>  investing our city funds in groups like Chevron and Lockheed Martin, which are destabilizing companies, we are betraying the trust that our students and our children have placed in us. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11787.987s">There</a>  is absolutely no excuse to be funding these industries that explicitly and knowingly destabilize and destroy our planet. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11796.294s">To</a>  do so is out of line with our stated climate action plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11800.577s">Things</a>  that we've agreed to as a community is important to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11804.22s">It</a>  runs directly counter to a sustainable and healthy world. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11808.977s">By</a>  divesting from these industries, we are protecting not just our homes and our health, we are creating a future that benefits and safeguards Medford residents who will live here long after us. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11820.025s">I</a>  strongly urge you, although you are deciding not to vote today, to be brave, to be bold, and to be kind, and vote in favor of divesting from these harmful companies. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11831.534s">Thank</a>  you so much.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11837.982s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11838.502s">We'll</a>  stay at the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11840.083s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11841.444s">You</a>  have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[Benjamin Streim]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11845.027s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11845.607s">Benjamin</a>  Chime, 76 Marion Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11849.25s">Yeah,</a>  I'm speaking in favor of bringing forth this ordinance, hoping we can vote on this very soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11856.215s">In</a>  February of last year, this council voted in favor of a resolution calling for a ceasefire in Gaza, asking the government to use its full power to bring about an end to the war. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11865.161s">It</a>  also mentioned, quote, <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11867.097s">the</a>  inalienable right of all people to live in peace, free from fear of harm and prejudice. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11872.78s">It's</a>  now one and a half years later after that resolution, 20 months after the war started, there's still no ceasefire. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11879.104s">And</a>  the more than 2 million Palestinians in Gaza have not lived in peace for a single day since then. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11883.887s">It's</a>  painful to realize that somehow we are able as a society to carry on with life where people are killed and starved every single day. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11892.939s">And</a>  it's even more painful to look at that and understand that the only reason for this genocide, that this genocide has been allowed to continue for so long, is the unconditional support of this government. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11905.973s">Both</a>  the previous and the current administration for Israel's war through the endless supply of weapons, political support, money. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11913.634s">A</a>  lot of these weapons that are used to kill civilians are made here by American companies like Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, produced in our backyards in Massachusetts and across the country, designed by researchers in places like MIT. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11926.505s">And</a>  I think it's important to realize how life here and death in Gaza are connected, how our tax dollars finance this genocide, how our pension funds benefit from the profit companies make by destroying other people's lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11941.85s">Divestment</a>  is one small but concrete and material step to resist the cycle. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11947.394s">The</a>  city of Medford doesn't have a lot of money in investments accounts, and I think in the large scale of things, not significant amounts of money in general. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11959.443s">And</a>  even if we divest Lockheed Martin, we'll probably not even notice the change. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11964.918s">But</a>  it is one weird step, and it is one drop in the bucket. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11968.44s">And</a>  if more and more cities and states and other institutions follow our steps, that will bring down the war industry eventually. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11975.544s">Because</a>  all these companies care about is money, nothing else. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11978.967s">And</a>  to some of the earlier comments, I'm sure it's complex. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11983.289s">I'm</a>  sure there's legal concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11984.47s">I'm</a>  sure there's questions like, who makes these calls? <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11987.492s">What</a>  companies to divest from? <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11989.88s">But</a>  I think it's really the least we can do with this urgency. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=11993.082s">And</a>  I would encourage city staff and Councilors who have questions on this to really prioritize and think what we can do as little as it is to stop this genocide. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12002.607s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12004.348s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_22]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12004.808s">We'll</a>  stay at the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12010.752s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12013.493s">Hello,</a>  Evan Bell, 200 Winthrop Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12016.873s">I'm</a>  here to speak in support of this ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12018.654s">I'm</a>  here to talk mostly about fossil fuel divestment. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12021.455s">These</a>  are campaigns that I've been a part of since 2012 when I was a student at Tufts, also as a resident, talking about the state funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12031.139s">Those</a>  have not been super successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12032.519s">This</a>  is a hard campaign. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12033.76s">It</a>  requires a lot of work, but it is important. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12036.161s">It</a>  remains a key tactic of the climate justice movement for over a decade now. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12041.663s">Because</a>  there have been notable victories like New York State, the Ford Foundation, Harvard University, and many more cities, businesses, universities, it continues to be an important tactic because it reminds us to invest in the world we want to see, not a world of pollution and violence. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12057.562s">We</a>  experienced climate change here in Medford and we suffer real heat waves like today. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12061.426s">We</a>  also see it with worsening weather events and droughts in Massachusetts we've seen climate change wash away crops we've seen sea level rise impact our neighboring coastal communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12074.268s">And</a>  those who have been impacted first and worst are the environmental justice communities and our neighbors, our friends who are incarcerated is an important one for today. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12084.2s">These</a>  are people who have the greatest exposure to heat and the least ability to affect their environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12090.467s">Climate</a>  change is an injustice exacerbator. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12093.799s">It</a>  drives immigration as refugees flee their homes when they are no longer safe, when there are no options to work, the cost of living, of eating and getting around is too much. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12103.042s">It</a>  impacts all injustice, sometimes literally lighting the fire under already stressed communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12109.203s">I</a>  support this ordinance because we actively choose the world we want to live in as we choose to invest our money. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12115.463s">We</a>  can continue to choose to invest in war, genocide, and fossil fuels and make it all worse, or we can choose to divest and invest instead in a better world. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12124.327s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12133.772s">Hello,</a>  my name is Owen, I live in South Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12136.353s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears for bringing this to the agenda and members of the city council for giving us this opportunity to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12143.684s">I</a>  support item 25105 and I urge you to move it forward speedily even though you have chosen not to vote tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12151.451s">Medford</a>  should divest our tax dollars from corporations that are causing grave harm to human rights and the environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12158.178s">I'm</a>  devastated by the genocide Israel has been perpetrating in Gaza and the fact that my Medford tax dollars are supporting weapons companies, enabling and profiting from this genocide. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12169.628s">Last</a>  year, Medford City Council passed an important resolution in favor of a ceasefire in Gaza. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12174.311s">We</a>  must back that ceasefire resolution with concrete action to divest from the weapons companies profiting from the ongoing genocide. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12183.01s">I</a>  spoke today with a friend of mine who lives in Massachusetts who grew up in Gaza and still has the majority of his family living there. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12188.872s">His</a>  parents, his three brothers, four sisters all live in Gaza. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12192.593s">The</a>  houses of all of his aunts and uncles in Gaza on his mother's side have been completely destroyed by bombing. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12198.055s">He</a>  estimates that 95% of his family members in Gaza have had their homes destroyed by Israeli bombing. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12204.877s">His</a>  parents' home in Gaza was destroyed in 2009 and then rebuilt by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12211.723s">That</a>  home now houses all of his displaced relatives from all over Gaza who have lost their homes since October 2023. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12218.429s">My</a>  friend spoke of the unrelenting anxiety, fear, and displacement that his loved ones face in Gaza. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12224.654s">This</a>  destruction and violence is funded by our Medford tax dollars being invested in companies like Lockheed Martin. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12231.12s">According</a>  to tracking data from the American Friends Service Committee, Lockheed Martin is the world's largest weapons manufacturer and supplies Israel with F-16 and F-35 fighter jets, which Israel has been using to bomb Gaza. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12244.632s">Israel</a>  also uses the company's C-130 Hercules transport planes to support the ground invasion of Gaza and manufactures AGM-114 Hellfire missiles <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12254.46s">for</a>  Israel's Apache helicopters. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12256.561s">Medford</a>  should immediately divest from fossil fuels, detention and prisons, weapons companies, and companies perpetrating human rights abuses. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12265.905s">Fossil</a>  fuel companies are responsible for pollution and climate change negatively affecting us all. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12271.428s">Prison</a>  and detention corporations are profiting off of caging our neighbors and immigrant communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12277.632s">Weapons</a>  companies are profiting from killing children and families and destroying homes and neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12282.696s">Medford</a>  is a community that values human and environmental wellbeing. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12286.539s">We</a>  must ensure that our investments align with these values. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12289.861s">Please</a>  move forward item 25-105 speedily. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12293.084s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Gaston Fiore]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12302.992s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. president got some fear 61 Stignero I oppose the so called values line local investments ordinance as written. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12311.737s">I</a>  applaud the moral impulse behind aligning medford's investment with our values, yet good intentions must align with fiscal prudence and security. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12323.158s">Section</a>  2697C forces our treasurer to divest from any firm earning even $1 from national defense work. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12334.167s">That</a>  sweeps in companies building weather satellites, cybersecurity tools, and body armor that protect our service members. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12342.373s">A</a>  few lines later, section 2697E exempts the pension portfolio whenever divestment would harm risk-adjusted returns. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12352.487s">The</a>  sponsors therefore seem to admit the policy will probably underperform, but they shield retirees while making ordinary taxpayers absorb the heat. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12362.136s">If</a>  the screen violates fiduciary duty for pensioners, it violates the same duty to every resident who funds our streets, schools, and libraries. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12372.145s">Strategically,</a>  the ban is reckless. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12375.015s">Deterrence</a>  depends on an unrivaled military whose ships, jets, and humanitarian aid aircraft still run on high energy density fuels. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12385.8s">Green</a>  hydrogen, the hope for substitute, is nascent. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12389.662s">Only</a>  pilot plants of a few tons per day are online and costs are rising, not falling. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12396.013s">Until</a>  scalable zero-carbon propulsion exists, divesting from firms that refine jet fuel or machine turbine blades does not advance peace or the climate. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12405.82s">It</a>  merely cedes advantage to actors who do not share our values. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12411.524s">Finally,</a>  defense equities diversify risk. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12414.686s">They</a>  have low correlation with consumer sectors and often outperform during downturns, characteristics that stabilize city revenues. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12422.088s">Selling</a>  them will not close a single factory. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12424.589s">It</a>  will simply weaken our balance sheet. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12427.61s">I</a>  urge you to vote no. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12429.011s">Please</a>  commission an evidence-based study of realistic sustainability criteria instead of passing a measure that compromises both fiscal stewardship and national security. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12439.935s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12440.515s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Goldstein]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12448.387s">Hi,</a>  Sam Goldstein, 29 Martin Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12450.728s">Thank</a>  you for bringing this forward, councillors. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12455.991s">It</a>  is hard not to notice that I believe the temperature got up to 104, 105 today. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12465.376s">We're</a>  experiencing, in a very literal, immediate sense, the impacts of capitalism and the climate crisis. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12478.74s">And,</a>  you know, I appreciate what this is, this ordinance is trying to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12485.702s">And,</a>  you know, I think we'll do. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12490.183s">I</a>  think an earlier speaker had noted, you know, all the potential impacts of, you know, this ordinance and was listing off a bit of a litany of different companies that have, you know, committed war crimes or crimes against humanity. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12506.045s">You</a>  know, we've talked a lot about Lockheed Martin, but even companies as mundane as Chiquita, you know, I think a few months ago was found, I think, maybe in a civil proceeding to have been funding a right-wing death squad. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12520.472s">And,</a>  you know, this is, I think, you know, the reality we live in. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12525.093s">And,</a>  you know, I appreciate the aims of, you know, of what this is trying to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12535.06s">I</a>  am Jewish. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12536.0s">I</a>  do want to say I find the conflation of Jewish identity in the state of Israel, as has been noted by some previous speakers, to be offensive. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12549.125s">It's</a>  not something I support, the conflation between. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12553.466s">And</a>  certainly, I don't think that it's certainly not fair that the state of Israel has killed tens of thousands of people, many of them children. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12565.358s">And</a>  I think that to frame, to not allow reproach for these massacres that are occurring at food aid distribution sites that have been going on in both very technologically sophisticated and also simple and brutal ways, I find <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12589.809s">You</a>  know, the timing of that conversation, you know disturbing because I think it doesn't allow us to, you know, examine. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12598.653s">You</a>  know what's going on, which is at the end of the day just a grossly disproportionate death toll in a war between. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12606.177s">a</a>  country that is armed to the teeth with the most sophisticated weapons technology in human history against people who have had their health care and just basic civilian life-sustaining infrastructure annihilated. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12625.587s">So</a>  I think it's important that we check that and we recognize that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12629.929s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12631.409s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12635.807s">So</a>  at the podium, name and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12637.549s">You</a>  have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12639.091s">Hi,</a>  I'm Debbie Schillkraut-Russell. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12640.953s">I</a>  live on Woburn Street, and I'm actually speaking about a different topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12645.217s">On</a>  Saturday morning, I just wanted in the record that on Saturday morning, several vehicles with ICE agents in them pulled someone over right in front of my house and detained them. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12655.668s">We</a>  emailed you all about it, and I know Councilwoman Lazzaro was considering bringing it up later, but it's well past my bedtime. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12664.115s">So</a>  I just wanted to have it on the record and have an opportunity to say that, you know, as much as I know about this issue on paper, when it's happening on your doorstep, it makes you realize, I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12677.306s">And</a>  I think it made me realize it would be very helpful <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12681.012s">Or</a>  at least I became very curious what our local elected officials want residents to do if we witness this happening on our doorsteps. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12689.156s">What</a>  does local law enforcement want us to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12692.718s">Should</a>  I call the police? <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12693.959s">You</a>  hear stories about people impersonating ICE agents because they're often not wearing uniforms. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12700.242s">There</a>  was a feeling of kind of paralysis, of what are we supposed to do in this situation? <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12704.483s">I</a>  will say that my husband contacted Luce, I'm not sure if I'm pronouncing their name correctly, and they were exceptionally helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12711.365s">They</a>  were able to identify the person who was taken and notify his family. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12716.326s">So</a>  if anyone else sees this happen, I would recommend contacting them, but I just think it made me realize <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12723.149s">hearing</a>  from our elected officials and from law enforcement of their perspectives on what they recommend citizens do when we see this happen would be helpful.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12734.483s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12735.524s">I'm</a>  gonna just pause there. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12737.025s">We</a>  do have a resolution under suspension to consider on that topic later. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12739.988s">We've</a>  had several meetings on the topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12741.97s">I'm</a>  gonna quickly go to Councilor Lazzaro since she was mentioned and thank you for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12746.975s">And</a>  I think we're all deeply disturbed by what's been happening in this community and our targeting by federal agents. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12754.001s">Councilor</a>  Lazzaro.</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12755.185s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12755.905s">I</a>  appreciate the need to go to bed. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12758.966s">I</a>  feel that also often I we Councilor, Vice President Collins and I do have a resolution under suspension, I would like to let this, this topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12771.59s">finish</a>  before we discuss this, but I encourage anybody who does need to go home, this meeting will be, it's live streaming on YouTube right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12780.859s">You'll</a>  be able to watch it after the fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12785.083s">We'll</a>  talk about this at length, hopefully not too much at length, but we'll talk about this shortly. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12790.669s">So</a>  thank you for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12793.231s">We</a>  are going to take it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12794.472s">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12799.57s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Lazzaro. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12800.911s">Councilor</a>  Collins, are you good? <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12803.432s">All</a>  right, we'll go to the podium, or what do you want? <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12807.374s">Okay,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12808.695s">We'll</a>  go back to, actually, I'm sorry, we do have a hand on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12811.897s">I'm</a>  gonna take the hand on Zoom, and then we'll come back to the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12818.72s">Lara</a>  Germanis, name and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12820.661s">You</a>  have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12822.267s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12823.347s">My</a>  name is Lara Germanis. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12824.668s">I'm</a>  actually a Malden resident, but grew up for many years and lived in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12831.009s">And</a>  I just wanted to intervene briefly as a physician and also as somebody who has been spending an extensive period of time both reading the humanitarian literature and <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12844.914s">working</a>  on other campaigns, studying other campaigns, which have involved divestment. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12851.72s">Just</a>  a comment regarding some of the remarks that have been made earlier about this ordinance, which, you know, the language is quite circumspect. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12861.409s">I'll</a>  say, you know, some of the language in <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12865.593s">Section</a>  2697D, which specifies that public funds should not be invested in severe violations of human rights and international law as determined by international legal and humanitarian bodies. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12881.218s">You</a>  know, that language regarding international legal and humanitarian bodies is, you know, is quite similar to language which has been recommended by international law. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12892.761s">Humanitarian</a>  law professors for other divestment language. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12897.646s">And,</a>  you know, while the word severe is not particularly specific, it is actually very consistent with precedent set by other divestment ordinances that have been pursued by institutions and local governments and that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12912.198s">This</a>  particular kind of language has been used in resolutions that have referred back to guidance that is offered by the American Friends Service Committee for organizations that are invested in war crimes. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12928.61s">And</a>  there's a lot of lenience and latitude for the city council in the implementation of this ordinance to make sure that it does not change investments in ways that significantly harm taxpayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12942.555s">But</a>  accusations that workers and companies are going to be harmed or that companies are offshoring work because of divestment, as opposed to because of opportunities to exploit workers in other countries, I find to be <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12957.94s">sort</a>  of in bad faith. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12960.761s">And,</a>  you know, I think as evidenced this evening by the number of residents who have spoken out, you know, nobody's trying to hide anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12968.163s">But</a>  if we are going to oppose war crimes, we must oppose them everywhere in the world. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12973.164s">We</a>  should impose genocide in Sudan, in Palestine, and we should oppose human rights abuses when they occur on our own city streets with masked ICE agents using secret police tactics to detain people. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12986.788s">and</a>  the inhumane conditions that people are experiencing in private prisons. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12994.652s">And</a>  that's why it's really apt that these all go together in this divestment resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=12998.953s">Thank</a>  you so much for your leadership. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13000.494s">And</a>  I do wish that the council had the opportunity to pass it this evening.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13005.856s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13007.537s">Seeing</a>  no further hands on Zoom, I will go back to the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13012.299s">Name</a>  and address, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13013.42s">You'll</a>  have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[Kh7pOoZw_4E_SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13015.944s">David</a>  Sayers 19 Park Street, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13019.407s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears I certainly appreciate the sentiment and the intent that you said this was put forth as, and I take you at your word that it's not like you had some ulterior motive when. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13031.998s">When</a>  you put this forth, but it also seems very clear for many of the people that have spoken that the treasurer collector would be under enormous pressure to actually divest in one perhaps only one country Israel and the indigenous Jewish population that that lives there. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13051.573s">It's</a>  nice to think that we could divest from a company or multiple companies and end war and weapons, but that simply isn't the case because our enemies don't buy weapons from those countries, they make their own. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13063.221s">And</a>  so we need defensive weapons. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13066.604s">In</a>  addition, how would you even <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13068.905s">go</a>  about accomplishing this ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13072.707s">The</a>  parts in the thermostat over there are also the same parts that are used in weapons. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13078.23s">I</a>  understand the air conditioning is not working very well right now, so maybe we don't think we need it, but I'm guessing we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13087.551s">These</a>  international legal and vaguely humanitarian bonds list all sorts of companies, including Google and Microsoft Word that work with Israel and its military. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13097.296s">Did</a>  you use Word to draft this? <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13098.977s">If</a>  so, you may have committed, you may have been supporting war crimes. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13103.559s">It's</a>  very complicated and hard to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13107.301s">And</a>  I'm not sure that the city should take it on. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13110.302s">As</a>  individuals, obviously we can invest or divest from anything we'd like. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13115.19s">In</a>  terms of fossil fuels, I'd love to say, yeah, we should be divesting from all these companies, investing in solar panels, but we buy the solar panels from countries that commit human rights violations. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13127.815s">It's</a>  not so easy to say that we're going to live by a very specific set of values. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13135.704s">And</a>  how are these values determined? <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13137.385s">Why</a>  are we not including states that support terrorism? <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13142.791s">Why</a>  are we not including companies that maybe don't support LGBTQ plus rights or women's rights? <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13149.012s">or</a>  freedom of religion or whatever the values are. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13152.054s">How</a>  do we decide, how do you decide as a city council, what the collective values of the people you represent are? <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13159.238s">Some</a>  of these values I agree with, but not all of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13161.72s">And</a>  obviously from people who've spoken, they disagree with me on what values are important or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13167.723s">And</a>  like I said, as individuals, obviously we can do what we want, but as a city council trying to represent the entire city of Medford, it's not clear to me that this truly represents, though I understand its intent, but that this truly represents or will be used to represent the values of the population of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13185.799s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13187.381s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13187.761s">Do</a>  we have anyone who would like to speak who hasn't spoken on this topic? <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13192.705s">And</a>  Ellen, you did speak right at the beginning, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13195.542s">Not</a>  on this one. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13196.102s">All</a>  right, then we'll take Ellen, and then we'll go to anyone else who hasn't spoken yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13200.925s">And</a>  then we'll come back around for one more minute for people who have already spoken, but Ellen, you have the floor name and address for the record please you have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[Ellen Epstein]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13209.63s">Ellen</a>  Epstein 15 growth street, Jewish resident of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13219.817s">I</a>  just want to say that any lack of safety that I feel as a Jewish person in this world right now is the result of the actions of the State of Israel and our own government, which has supported and enabled the actions of the State of Israel. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13240.545s">I</a>  think it's unfortunate actually that that <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13245.397s">point</a>  of view is being brought into this discussion about clean investing. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13251.84s">I</a>  was shocked to find out that city funds are invested in these companies and, you know, clean investment is not only possible, it's common and it does not necessarily mean lower returns. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13270.019s">So,</a>  I really do hope that this resolution moves forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13278.323s">I</a>  thank you, President Bears, for bringing it forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13285.446s">That's</a>  it, thank you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13286.466s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13290.068s">One</a>  second, we have somebody who hasn't spoken yet on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13294.03s">Meneer</a>  Jimenez, I'll recognize you, and you will have three minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13297.931s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Munir Jirmanus]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13300.798s">Ah,</a>  Munir Germanus. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13306.621s">I</a>  cannot turn my video on for some reason, but I'll continue anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13311.723s">I'll</a>  be very brief. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13313.995s">I</a>  appreciate the fact that this resolution, this proposal has been put forth, now that President Trump has directly involved our country in yet another unprovoked war. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13328.707s">The</a>  stocks of our weapon manufacturers are soaring. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13332.85s">I</a>  see this as an amazing ordinance that will divest Medford's fund from fossil fuels. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13339.592s">from</a>  profit prisons and detention centers, weapon companies, military contractors, and many other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13350.299s">I</a>  mean, our values matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13353.64s">Today,</a>  some of the public funds that our city manages are invested in some of the world's largest weapons manufacturers. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13361.305s">These</a>  companies are complicit in expanding these wars and are benefiting from them. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13367.116s">And</a>  our government uses our tax dollars to support these wars. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13371.257s">In</a>  the meantime, if you've heard the news, many of our congresspeople make illegal profits by manipulating the stock market, along with a leader who benefits every time he makes a declaration that plays havoc with the value of stocks and suits the purpose of insiders who benefit from them. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13391.586s">Another</a>  example is businesses that are helping destroy communities through violence and incarceration. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13399.452s">This</a>  is certainly to be avoided considering how many innocent people who are arrested by ICE are artificially held for longer periods of incarceration so the folks who run these detention centers can make more money doing so. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13415.724s">I</a>  urgently <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13417.49s">ardently</a>  urge all members of the City Council to approve and support this ordinance that reflects our morals and our values. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13427.037s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13429.519s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13431.841s">We</a>  have one more person on Zoom who has not spoken yet on this item. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13436.304s">Go</a>  to Eileen Lerner. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13438.165s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please, and you will have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[nzT0OcLHmhc_SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13745.617s">My</a>  community is afraid of stochastic terrorism, where the repeated demonization of a particular people in our case, Jewish people, by extension through the state of Israel, which I agree my physical and safety also stems from the actions of a government that I do not support. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13760.27s">And</a>  yet, <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13761.031s">The</a>  people who were murdered in DC, who were attacked in Boulder, were not asked for their position about Zionism, about Israel, about Palestine, about anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13769.395s">They</a>  were murdered for being Jews, and we are afraid that that will happen to someone here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13775.457s">It's</a>  not a question of if, but it's when and where, and we deserve protection also, although the progressive community seems to have decided that we do not.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13790.787s">I'm</a>  not debating, I'm just taking a point of personal privilege. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13796.912s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13798.053s">Thank</a>  you for indulging me to my fellow councillors. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13801.856s">Well,</a>  I'm very moved by a lot of what I have heard tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13807.78s">And</a>  I am quite shocked by some of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13812.244s">Certainly</a>  finding procedural reasons to stall on timely and urgently needed reforms is catching on as a trend in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13820.55s">I</a>  heard tonight that standing up against war crimes is divisive. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13824.712s">I</a>  heard that the Jewish community is unilateral in its feelings on this topic and its feelings on Israel. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13829.693s">I</a>  heard it implied that Jewish discomfort stands as more of a clear and present danger than genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13840.718s">I</a>  have heard antisemitism and the protest of Israeli war crimes, once again, falsely conflated. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13847.699s">I</a>  have heard that the United Nations, a crowning achievement of international cooperation is illegitimate because it is called a spade a spade in observing war crimes and genocide. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13859.223s">I</a>  have heard, excuse me, I'm taking up points. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13867.225s">I</a>  have heard wild mischaracterizations and deeply offensive language used to disparage the council's process on the ceasefire resolution last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13876.312s">including</a>  what I would call outright lies about what was or communicated or not communicated to me, the resolution sponsor. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13882.795s">People</a>  can feel free to call me out directly about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13885.616s">I</a>  don't care. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13886.036s">I</a>  am very proud of that resolution and very secure in my Jewish identity. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13890.398s">I</a>  have heard voices decrying divestment as illegitimate because some of its proponents wear keffiyehs and have ties in Gaza. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13897.621s">That</a>  makes me wonder, <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13899.211s">What</a>  about the opponents of divestment who are deeply embedded with Christian Zionism? <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13903.757s">Are</a>  they given reciprocal scrutiny and skepticism? <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13906.6s">Do</a>  we throw out that whole idea because of this association? <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13909.504s">I</a>  received hundreds of messages from people today associated with that identity. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13914.85s">These</a>  are people who see me and my family as Jews as nothing more than pawns, entities that must be deported to the nation of Israel and, depending on their ideology, converted to Christianity so that so-called real Christians may experience the revelation and ascend with Jesus to heaven. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13932.695s">People</a>  and Councilors are saying, or in some cases, heavily implying that this ordinance should be stalled or scrapped because it implicates Israel. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13942.103s">As</a>  though Palestinian solidarity is invalidating. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13947.728s">I'm</a>  taking a point of personal privilege. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13953.152s">As</a>  if Palestinian solidarity is invalidating, that that opinion is cancerous. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13960.853s">Apparently,</a>  our ability to be in alignment with our values to divest from things that we know are making us sick and making us unsafe and directly contradicting our values, our ability to take a vote tonight to be the community that we report to be has an obstacle, a fear of telling the truth when it comes to Israel. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13980.4s">If</a>  you listen to President Bears' preamble, you will have heard that these procedural questions and these concerns about fiscal responsibility are the real quote unquote thin veil <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13989.811s">going</a>  on in this conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=13990.992s">Thinly</a>  veiling that the real obstacle to divesting from fossil fuel infrastructure, private prisons, weapons manufacturing, and entities implicated in human rights violations is Zionism. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=14003.252s">I</a>  am once again disgusted that my identity is being used to justify remaining invested in nations that flout international law and wage genocide against populations deemed inconvenient that have been allowed to poison our environment for decades, and for for profit presence that lock up innocent and vulnerable people, quite possibly, including neighbors of our own community. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=14025.212s">As</a>  a Jew, I cannot make heads or tails of the argument that this goal of divesting from destructive entities is anti-Jewish in any way. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=14031.993s">It</a>  is deeply aligned with the Jewish values that I hold most dear, which is that tikkun olam, repairing the world, and solidarity with oppressed peoples, is my Jewish family's most foundational value, not blind fealty to any ethnostate. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=14049.915s">I</a>  look forward to discussing this matter again in the future with my colleagues and with the community, hopefully very soon, and to the chair, and through the chair, to all those who have been brave enough to support this progressive action, to those who speak in favor, to those who were brave enough to share any opinion on this matter, including those who disagree with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=14068.642s">I</a>  would like to say, Yashir Chalaf, may your strength persist and grow. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=14075.045s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

<a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=14447.332s">The</a>  answer is simple, self-determination. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=14451.207s">by</a>  electing representatives to pass laws through the legislative process afforded to us by the Constitution of our country and our state, and replacing those elected officials when their actions do not reflect the will of the voters of their community. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=14465.882s">If</a>  this proposal or my values <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=14469.239s">or</a>  my actions do not pass democratic or electoral muster, I will accept the result and I will be relieved that I live in a society where self-determination and freedom are at its foundation. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=14483.368s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=14483.748s">Is</a>  there a motion on the floor?

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=14699.875s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=14700.656s">I</a>  have <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=14703.076s">offered</a>  a very similar paper before. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=14705.738s">And</a>  this is a reiteration of the same resolution, but with new information this Saturday. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=14713.764s">At</a>  about noon, or maybe just before that, I received an email from a resident in my neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=14721.59s">About</a>  half a block from where I live, somebody was arrested by ICE. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=14731.11s">I</a>  found out about it because a resident let me know. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=14734.431s">And</a>  I just so happened to have a meeting scheduled with our provisional police chief, Paul Covino, on Monday. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=14745.154s">And</a>  I discussed this issue with him. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=14747.014s">I</a>  was meant to meet with him to talk about the things that Chief Buckley and I had been discussing and that were ongoing issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=14757.977s">with</a>  the roads and various other items, but we talked about this and Chief Covino and I had a really, really great conversation about, you know, the hesitation of the Medford Police Department to offer something of use for us and <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=14780.976s">The</a>  point of this resolution is not to catch the Medford Police Department out. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=14786.159s">It's</a>  not to get them in trouble. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=14789.261s">It's</a>  not to say, like, we're catching you working with ICE. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=14797.606s">I</a>  believe very firmly that the Medford Police Department is following the ordinances that we have set forth, that the <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=14807.451s">Medford</a>  Police Department frequently is not made aware by federal immigration's enforcement of the operations that take place in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=14818.495s">And</a>  I think that a report could say that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=14821.597s">In</a>  this case, Chief Covino told me he was, I knew more about this arrest than he did because I was told by a resident who witnessed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=14830.212s">because</a>  she lives across the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=14831.792s">And</a>  the that could be that I would be happy to receive that as a report because it would share information with our residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=14842.114s">I</a>  think it would settle fears. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=14843.675s">I</a>  think it would release any misinformation that may have been circulating. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=14851.316s">And</a>  I think it would reveal that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=14855.413s">In</a>  Medford, we have a clear partnership with our law enforcement agency and that we are working together to keep us safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=14867.642s">And</a>  I also wanted to say that I had a conversation last week with another resident who said that when they asked <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=14882.248s">When</a>  they saw somebody monitoring a neighborhood in Medford and they believed them to be law enforcement and they weren't sure if they were Medford police or ICE officers, they went and they asked for ID. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=14897.766s">and</a>  they were Medford police. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=14900.788s">The</a>  Medford police officers very quickly said, oh, we're Medford police. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=14905.01s">Here's</a>  our IDs. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=14906.711s">And</a>  the person was like, oh, great, wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=14910.033s">This</a>  is not upsetting. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=14912.154s">This</a>  is not scary. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=14913.175s">This</a>  is not concerning. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=14914.816s">This</a>  is a person who is not hiding themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=14918.858s">This</a>  is a person who works with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=14920.599s">This</a>  is somebody who is part of the fabric of our community and who is <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=14926.397s">doing</a>  the best that they can to be integrated in the work that we're all doing to maintain public safety and transparency and openness. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=14940.288s">So</a>  that's the goal of this resolution as far as I'm concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=14945.672s">In</a>  our current environment where <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=14951.007s">somebody</a>  may not be as readily willing to offer an ID when somebody asks them for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=14960.429s">That</a>  is a dangerous thing, especially for people who may be a local elected official. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=14967.231s">Somebody</a>  impersonated a police officer and then used that to shoot a local elected official and her husband and her dog in Minnesota. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=14979.711s">That</a>  is illegal and terrifying. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=14985.673s">I</a>  talked to Chief Cabino about that, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=14987.954s">And</a>  he affirmed to me, by the way, that if you ask a law enforcement officer from any department for identification while they are engaged in law enforcement activity and they don't give it to you, that you should call 911 right away. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=15003.659s">So</a>  if anybody's wondering about that, that's what you should do. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=15008.645s">That's</a>  not exactly the point of this resolution, but it's related. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=15012.728s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=15014.91s">This</a>  is just, you know, this happened over the weekend. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=15017.312s">It</a>  was past the deadline. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=15018.153s">So</a>  we offered this under suspension and I will stop talking now. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=15021.576s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=15030.443s">Vice</a>  President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=15034.586s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=15036.027s">I</a>  want to thank <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=15036.945s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Lazzaro for co sponsoring this resolution with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=15042.572s">And</a>  thank you to the residents who reached out, not only to community networks about the ice arrest over the weekend, but also to city officials including myself and other city <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=15053.545s">to</a>  make sure that we knew and to ask what more could be done to follow up on this abduction and to prevent future ones. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=15059.788s">I</a>  know Councilor Lazzaro shared a lot, and I appreciate the resident who spoke earlier who shared their experience and what they did in the aftermath of <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=15070.212s">witnessing</a>  or hearing about a arrest in their neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=15075.294s">We</a>  have, as President Bears mentioned earlier, we have had many discussions in many council meetings by this point on this topic of the presence of ICE in our community and whose responsibility it is to do what and what public safety means. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=15094.102s">In</a>  this time when the presence of law enforcement has a tenuous relationship to public safety, <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=15103.115s">and</a>  what the responsibility of our local public safety is when federal law enforcement are conducting raids that are not related to, that are not convincingly related to public safety and do not meaningfully involve our local public safety officials. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=15120.078s">I</a>  have been very heartened to see the presence of the Loose Hotline and other community organizations like it proliferate throughout our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=15128.96s">and</a>  for folks who want to know who to call when they see, when they suspect or they hear a rumor about ICE in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=15137.082s">I</a>  as one Councilor would recommend you to look up the loose hotline, explore their resources, get trained and be a part of that community network whose goals are to provide good information and spread good information and dispel rumors and spread preventative information about people's rights with immigration enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=15159.854s">At</a>  the same time, I am. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=15162.912s">again</a>  frustrated that community members have been put into, put into the position of having to be public safety officials when our local public safety officials should fulfill that role for us in every circumstance. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=15175.479s">And</a>  this resolution aims to be, we have brought up this idea with Medford Police Department before and we have heard some encouraging signs that this is something that they can do and something they're willing to do and I take that in good faith and I'm very heartened. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=15190.166s">That</a>  providing after reports of what happened and why when ice has been in the community is a place that we can start in providing the accountability and transparency and good communication from Medford Police Department to the city council and to more of the Medford community because this is I think what part of what the community is clamoring for. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=15208.513s">In</a>  this resolution, we're not asking Medford Police Department to spread the word whenever they hear that ICE is coming to town. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=15214.858s">We</a>  know that sometimes they get advance warning and sometimes they don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=15218.521s">This</a>  is just asking for them to be transparent with us and with the community about when ICE has been in the area and why and what they know about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=15226.047s">And</a>  like Councilor Lazzaro said, we know that sometimes the answers to those questions are going to be, we don't have a lot of information, fine, but let's make sure that there's a structure for being in regular communication about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=15236.568s">because</a>  certainly people in the community are seeing this happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=15240.991s">People</a>  are being affected by it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=15242.311s">People</a>  are being arrested and detained and abducted. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=15245.193s">And</a>  this is scary. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=15248.915s">And</a>  this is not in line with our values. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=15250.535s">And</a>  this is a threat to our public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=15252.696s">So</a>  I welcome collaboration with our public safety officials and at least trying to shed some light into this <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=15263.926s">very</a>  scary, opaque and fascistic use of federal law enforcement in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=15270.692s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=15270.992s">A</a>  motion to approve.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=15272.973s">Thank</a>  you on the motion approved by Vice President Collins seconded by second. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=15278.658s">We'll</a>  go to Councilor Leming.</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=15282.201s">One</a>  thing I did just want to do with my with my time is that the arrest was actually recorded <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=15290.683s">by</a>  one of the neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=15292.484s">And</a>  so I'm going to try to get a clip of this that doesn't get the guy's face too closely. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=15298.467s">But</a>  I do feel like these arrests are usually a little bit abstract, like people only just talk about them. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=15306.17s">And</a>  in this case, there was a couple of ICE agents who were arresting a pizza delivery driver, which I don't really think is that great of a <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=15316.762s">use</a>  of anybody's time if they're trying to stop, they're trying to protect the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=15324.844s">But</a>  it's a little silly, but I do think that a picture is worth a thousand words. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=15331.126s">And</a>  this really scared the neighbors who were here earlier tonight, but had to leave when they wanted to talk about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=15340.409s">And</a>  I do just like to have people see a little bit of this <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=15346.601s">see</a>  a little bit of the footage just so that it's not quite as abstract as it normally is when we're just talking about an arrest over the weekend. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=15353.664s">So</a>  thank you for listening. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=15358.926s">And</a>  I'm not going to, again, I'm not going to show the whole clip because I did realize that in some places it shows a close-up of his face and I decided I didn't really want to do that.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=15372.501s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Leming. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=15373.261s">Any</a>  further discussion by members of the Council on this resolution? <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=15376.383s">On</a>  the motion of Vice President Collins to approve, seconded by Councilor Lazzaro, is there any public participation on this resolution? <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=15387.354s">Yes,</a>  name and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=15390.176s">And</a>  you'll have three minutes.</p>
