[SPEAKER_35]: Karen has taken care of so many of our children with love and compassion over these years, and we recognize and salute you for your dedication.

61
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:58,940
[SPEAKER_35]: Councilor Scarpelli.

62
00:24:59,775 --> 00:25:10,231
[SPEAKER_40]: Mr. President, Karen's a former colleague of mine when I was when I was teaching at the McGlynn, she was an amazing individual, I think that what you realize right away is

63
00:25:14,147 --> 00:25:15,528
[SPEAKER_40]: the importance of a school nurse.

64
00:25:15,588 --> 00:25:18,911
[SPEAKER_40]: I think people forget nurses in general are so important.

65
00:25:19,532 --> 00:25:30,000
[SPEAKER_40]: And I think that, you know, I've seen it firsthand where nurses meant more than the doctors in our health issues that we've had in our family.

66
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:41,830
[SPEAKER_40]: So we saw firsthand Karen's compassion and her ability to calm so many youngsters down with so many different

67
00:25:43,388 --> 00:25:45,850
[SPEAKER_40]: health issues, and she was just an amazing person.

68
00:25:46,471 --> 00:25:58,461
[SPEAKER_40]: I will tell you the scariest day of my life is when I ran downstairs to her office because I thought I was having a stroke, and my lip was drooling, and I said, Karen, I think I'm having a stroke.

69
00:25:59,001 --> 00:26:00,763
[SPEAKER_40]: She slapped me in the top of the head and told me to leave.

70
00:26:00,783 --> 00:26:01,564
[SPEAKER_40]: She thought I was joking.

71
00:26:01,964 --> 00:26:03,065
[SPEAKER_40]: Stop being a joker, George.

72
00:26:03,825 --> 00:26:05,427
[SPEAKER_40]: And thank God it was Bell's palsy.

73
00:26:05,447 --> 00:26:08,690
[SPEAKER_40]: I had a Bell's palsy attack, but Karen was the person you went to.

74
00:26:09,497 --> 00:26:12,839
[SPEAKER_40]: made you feel comfortable, and she did so much.

75
00:26:12,879 --> 00:26:23,884
[SPEAKER_40]: And I know that she was a nurse for a long time in different facilities, but she decided to become a school nurse to be closer to her family.

76
00:26:24,444 --> 00:26:30,727
[SPEAKER_40]: And now that she'll be a grandma soon, I know she'll have plenty of time to take care of that amazing grandchild.

77
00:26:30,787 --> 00:26:35,329
[SPEAKER_40]: So wishing her much luck and happiness in retirement.

78
00:26:35,729 --> 00:26:36,070
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you.

79
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:38,831
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

80
00:26:39,835 --> 00:26:40,455
[SPEAKER_35]: Councilor Tseng.

81
00:26:42,056 --> 00:26:42,517
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you.

82
00:26:42,717 --> 00:26:50,341
[SPEAKER_30]: Well, I was a student at the time that Councilor Scarpelli was a teacher and nurse breeding was at the McGlynn.

83
00:26:51,762 --> 00:27:02,669
[SPEAKER_30]: And I just have very fond memories of my early days in school as a kindergartner, as a first grader, second grader going and seeing nurse breeding there.

84
00:27:04,573 --> 00:27:13,915
[SPEAKER_30]: be it something as simple as checking for lice or something, you know, the days where I needed a bit more care.

85
00:27:14,815 --> 00:27:16,835
[SPEAKER_30]: Nurse screen was always there for us.

86
00:27:17,615 --> 00:27:30,358
[SPEAKER_30]: And I think Councilor Scarpelli is absolutely right that for many families, including families that grew up quite poorly fine, the school nurse is your kind of access point to staying healthy.

87
00:27:33,773 --> 00:27:46,222
[SPEAKER_30]: Nurses like Nurse Breen are just so important in making sure that all of our families here in Medford get the treatment that they need, and all our kids get the treatment that they need.

88
00:27:46,763 --> 00:27:51,827
[SPEAKER_30]: So I thank Karen for her service, and I congratulate her on her retirement.

89
00:27:53,788 --> 00:27:54,649
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

90
00:27:54,669 --> 00:27:57,291
[SPEAKER_35]: We'll go three for three.

91
00:27:57,311 --> 00:28:01,834
[SPEAKER_35]: Nurse Breen was also my school nurse at some point, although I can't actually remember which school.

92
00:28:03,894 --> 00:28:12,759
[SPEAKER_35]: And in addition to congratulating her on retirement, I want to thank her and her family for giving her and her service to the city of Medford for all this time.

93
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:15,400
[SPEAKER_35]: And I hope that she gets to enjoy her retirement with them as well.

94
00:28:16,501 --> 00:28:17,041
[SPEAKER_35]: Is there a motion?

95

240
00:35:41,428 --> 00:35:43,370
[SPEAKER_18]: It will continue to be operating under the chamber's name.

241
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:47,032
[SPEAKER_40]: Again, Mr. President, I see everything in order.

242
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:49,674
[SPEAKER_40]: I yield to my colleagues for any questions they have.

243
00:35:49,734 --> 00:35:53,197
[SPEAKER_35]: Any further questions from members of the council about this paper and petition?

244
00:35:56,291 --> 00:35:57,172
[SPEAKER_35]: Just one for me.

245
00:35:57,192 --> 00:35:57,712
[SPEAKER_35]: Sure.

246
00:35:58,132 --> 00:35:59,553
[SPEAKER_35]: You said it's going to be operating under the same name.

247
00:35:59,593 --> 00:36:03,356
[SPEAKER_35]: Is it going to be operating, is Herb Chambers still going to be operating the facility?

248
00:36:03,696 --> 00:36:05,538
[SPEAKER_18]: No, Mr. Chambers is selling this dealership.

249
00:36:05,838 --> 00:36:06,098
[SPEAKER_35]: Okay.

250
00:36:07,219 --> 00:36:07,499
[SPEAKER_35]: All right.

251
00:36:10,527 --> 00:36:16,893
[SPEAKER_35]: Do you have any knowledge if that's part of a larger, we have several properties that he owns in the city, is that sort of a new strategy or?

252
00:36:17,434 --> 00:36:20,717
[SPEAKER_18]: This is part of quite a big transaction that's happening throughout the state.

253
00:36:20,757 --> 00:36:22,519
[SPEAKER_18]: He's selling 48 of his dealerships.

254
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,242
[SPEAKER_18]: They're all going to stay under the Chamber's name.

255
00:36:25,262 --> 00:36:33,190
[SPEAKER_18]: But if you're referring to the new construction, yeah, perhaps, yeah, since that's being built, that's not technically up for a license application right now.

256
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:38,154
[SPEAKER_18]: but it's my understanding that part of the future deal or that's not currently part of this deal.

257
00:36:38,174 --> 00:36:44,059
[SPEAKER_18]: So there's a possibility that we may be back before the board for a license there as well, but I can't speak to that at this moment.

258
00:36:44,419 --> 00:36:44,639
Okay.

259
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,160
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

260
00:36:46,022 --> 00:36:46,302
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

261
00:36:46,322 --> 00:36:53,565
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm gonna open the public hearing to anyone who'd like to speak in favor in opposition or otherwise speak on this paper.

262
00:36:54,405 --> 00:36:55,346
[SPEAKER_35]: Public hearing is open.

[SPEAKER_35]: If there are any questions, please read out to the Medford City Clerk's Office at 781-393-2425.

292
00:39:11,268 --> 00:39:14,349
[SPEAKER_35]: Do we have a representative?

293
00:39:14,449 --> 00:39:14,649
[SPEAKER_35]: Great.

294
00:39:14,709 --> 00:39:16,510
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm going to go to Councilor Scarpelli and then we'll come to you.

295
00:39:16,610 --> 00:39:17,410
[SPEAKER_35]: Councilor Scarpelli.

296
00:39:18,515 --> 00:39:22,357
[SPEAKER_40]: This breaks my heart to see Rob is leaving us.

297
00:39:22,417 --> 00:39:28,239
[SPEAKER_40]: I know that they've been a long standing company that has done so much for our community.

298
00:39:28,279 --> 00:39:36,663
[SPEAKER_40]: So it's sad to see them go, but I also noticed that the McGovern group is pretty well known and pretty respected as well.

299
00:39:36,723 --> 00:39:40,525
[SPEAKER_40]: So again, I see everything in order, Mr. President.

300
00:39:42,126 --> 00:39:44,387
[SPEAKER_40]: All the documents are, everything is,

301
00:39:45,328 --> 00:39:50,197
[SPEAKER_40]: All the I's are dotted, T's are crossed, so I yell to my colleagues if they have any questions before moving approval.

302
00:39:50,217 --> 00:39:51,839
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you.

303
00:39:51,879 --> 00:39:53,482
[SPEAKER_33]: If you'd like to give the first presentation, we'll move to the front.

304
00:39:53,502 --> 00:39:55,566
[SPEAKER_21]: My name's John Kennedy.

305
00:39:55,586 --> 00:39:57,970
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm the vice president of operations for McGovern Automotive Group.

306
00:39:58,739 --> 00:40:02,580
[SPEAKER_21]: Uh, we do currently have 23 locations in Massachusetts.

307
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:12,343
[SPEAKER_21]: Uh, and, uh, like you said, uh, the gravel family, uh, certainly did not, uh, sell to somebody who they, uh, took lightly.

308
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:19,384
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, so we, we are proud of that fact and we are looking forward to coming into the city and, uh, helping the community.

309
00:40:19,725 --> 00:40:22,465
[SPEAKER_21]: And, uh, we're always a big part of the community when we come in.

310
00:40:24,446 --> 00:40:25,126
[SPEAKER_21]: That's good to hear.

311
00:40:27,081 --> 00:40:27,781
[SPEAKER_35]: Great, thank you.

312
00:40:28,401 --> 00:40:30,362
[SPEAKER_35]: Do we have any questions from members of the council?

313
00:40:34,763 --> 00:40:37,144
[SPEAKER_35]: Seeing none from members of the council, I do have just a question or two.

314
00:40:37,804 --> 00:40:40,285
[SPEAKER_35]: Can you apply with fewer acronyms next time?

315
00:40:40,805 --> 00:40:42,326
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm sorry?

316
00:40:42,346 --> 00:40:43,606
[SPEAKER_35]: Your name has a lot of acronyms in it.

317
00:40:44,306 --> 00:40:47,007
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, it's McGovern Automotive Group, so MAG.

318
00:40:47,047 --> 00:40:48,007
[SPEAKER_21]: Sorry, it's OK.

319
00:40:48,027 --> 00:40:49,248
[SPEAKER_21]: We're getting feedback here.

320
00:40:49,748 --> 00:40:50,228
[SPEAKER_21]: It's the heat.

321
00:40:53,148 --> 00:40:54,389
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's McGovern Automotive Group.

322
00:40:55,070 --> 00:41:04,820
[SPEAKER_21]: And I do want to just clarify, we did our DBA, we did want to have as McGovern CJDR, that's Chrysler, Jeep, Dodge, Ram of Boston, instead of Medford.

323
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,382
[SPEAKER_21]: I know that we did apply for that.

324
00:41:06,482 --> 00:41:09,465
[SPEAKER_21]: And we just find that with our marketing, it casts a wider net.

325
00:41:09,505 --> 00:41:09,905
[SPEAKER_21]: That's all.

326
00:41:10,966 --> 00:41:11,087
[SPEAKER_35]: OK.

327
00:41:13,104 --> 00:41:21,887
[SPEAKER_35]: And in terms of the ownership, it says that there's a different the properties being sold to one company and then there's a tenant, could you explain that a relationship.

328
00:41:21,907 --> 00:41:26,628
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, we just we just we separate them we separate the real estate is in the business itself as well.

329
00:41:27,228 --> 00:41:27,429
[SPEAKER_21]: So,

330
00:41:29,229 --> 00:41:45,738
[SPEAKER_21]: It's, we actually, we have a couple different properties going on so we're trying to make it so that this moves as smoothly as possible just moving into the, the local building but we're also looking at some other properties for some storage facilities.

331
00:41:46,278 --> 00:41:48,619
[SPEAKER_35]: Okay, in Medford in Medford Yes.

332
00:41:48,799 --> 00:41:49,560
[SPEAKER_35]: Okay.

333
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,020
[SPEAKER_35]: I would just note.

334
00:41:52,481 --> 00:41:59,247
[SPEAKER_35]: Certainly in that area, we have a new zoning, the Mystic Avenue corridor district, and we're trying to shift away from auto-related uses in the area.

335
00:41:59,347 --> 00:42:00,729
[SPEAKER_35]: Understood.

336
00:42:01,289 --> 00:42:02,270
[SPEAKER_21]: We've seen that already.

337
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:02,911
[SPEAKER_35]: Okay.

338
00:42:03,911 --> 00:42:09,156
[SPEAKER_35]: And is the Grava family group selling all of their properties?

339
00:42:09,837 --> 00:42:10,878
[SPEAKER_21]: As far as I know, yes, they are.

340
00:42:12,158 --> 00:42:13,099
[SPEAKER_35]: Great, thank you.

341
00:42:13,279 --> 00:42:19,466
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm gonna open the public hearing to anyone in favor in opposition or who would otherwise like to comment on this license.

342
00:42:19,686 --> 00:42:20,427
[SPEAKER_35]: Public hearing is open.

343
00:42:21,628 --> 00:42:22,369
[SPEAKER_35]: Are you in favor?

344
00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:24,672
[SPEAKER_35]: Are you in favor of the license?

345
00:42:24,992 --> 00:42:25,553
[SPEAKER_21]: Of course I am.

346
00:42:25,753 --> 00:42:25,973
[SPEAKER_35]: Great.

347
00:42:26,734 --> 00:42:29,937
[SPEAKER_35]: Is there anyone else who'd like to speak either in person or on Zoom?

348
00:42:29,978 --> 00:42:32,000
[SPEAKER_35]: In person, please feel free to approach the podium.

349
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,702
[SPEAKER_35]: On Zoom, please raise your hand.

350
00:42:49,411 --> 00:42:51,172
[SPEAKER_35]: Seeing none, I'm declaring the public hearing closed.

351
00:42:52,073 --> 00:42:52,613
[SPEAKER_35]: Is there a motion?

352
00:42:52,633 --> 00:42:59,037
[SPEAKER_35]: I have a motion to approve by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Vice President Collins.

353
00:42:59,057 --> 00:43:00,158
[SPEAKER_35]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

354
00:43:03,861 --> 00:43:04,861
[SPEAKER_41]: Councilor Callahan is absent.

355
00:43:05,101 --> 00:43:05,882
[SPEAKER_41]: Vice President Collins?

356
00:43:06,002 --> 00:43:06,122

[SPEAKER_41]: Councilor Leming?

00:43:10,345 --> 00:43:11,646
[SPEAKER_41]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_41]: Yes.

00:43:13,127 --> 00:43:13,667
[SPEAKER_41]: Councilor Tseng?

364
00:43:14,328 --> 00:43:14,628
[SPEAKER_35]: Yes.

365
00:43:15,789 --> 00:43:16,329
[SPEAKER_41]: President Paris?

366
00:43:16,762 --> 00:43:18,783
[SPEAKER_35]: Yes, six in the affirmative, one absent, the motion passes.

367
00:43:18,803 --> 00:43:19,103
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

368
00:43:19,243 --> 00:43:19,944
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Councilor.

369
00:43:21,144 --> 00:43:22,105
[SPEAKER_35]: Vice President Collins.

370
00:43:27,728 --> 00:43:28,509
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, President Bears.

371
00:43:28,529 --> 00:43:33,772
[SPEAKER_24]: Do we have, I was going to make a motion, but do we have the petitioner present for the Common Vic license?

372
00:43:34,912 --> 00:43:35,152
[SPEAKER_35]: Sorry?

373
00:43:35,813 --> 00:43:40,916
[SPEAKER_24]: I was going to make a motion, but do we have the petitioner present for the Common Vic license before I do so?

374
00:43:40,976 --> 00:43:41,996
[SPEAKER_35]: Oh, sorry about that.

375
00:43:44,618 --> 00:43:44,938
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

376
00:43:46,344 --> 00:43:52,106
[SPEAKER_35]: 25-102, petition for amendment to a common victor's license, Raising Cane's Restaurants, LLC.

377
00:43:52,126 --> 00:43:54,847
[SPEAKER_35]: Let me find this in the packet real quick.

378
00:43:55,047 --> 00:43:56,508
[SPEAKER_35]: I know we have representatives here.

379
00:44:04,290 --> 00:44:06,731
[SPEAKER_35]: To the Honorable City Council, Councilors,

380
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:16,487
[SPEAKER_35]: The undersigned respectfully request an amendment to our operating hours for our common vixlers license 5am to 7am Monday, 11pm to 12am.

381
00:44:17,028 --> 00:44:20,891
[SPEAKER_35]: And these are the amended, I'm assuming you're not going to be closed from 7am to 11pm.

382
00:44:21,532 --> 00:44:22,553
[SPEAKER_35]: So these are the additions.

383
00:44:22,893 --> 00:44:25,235
[SPEAKER_35]: Okay, so you'd be open until midnight.

384
00:44:25,856 --> 00:44:27,697
[SPEAKER_35]: Every night, and you would be open from five to 7am.

385
00:44:29,693 --> 00:44:41,696
[SPEAKER_35]: And the brief explanation the petitioners are seeking to extend the morning hours of operation to 5am solely for the purpose of accepting deliveries of product and supplies to avoid congestion associated with deliveries during normal business hours of the plaza and the restaurant.

386
00:44:42,177 --> 00:44:45,678
[SPEAKER_35]: In addition, the petitioners requesting an extension of the evening hours of operation from 11pm to 12am.

387
00:44:47,418 --> 00:44:54,700
[SPEAKER_35]: The requested extension of hours of operation is consistent with the hours of operation of similarly situated restaurants, both within the Fellsway Plaza and the surrounding area.

388
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:57,200
[SPEAKER_35]: Business name, Raising Cane's Chicken Fingers.

389
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:00,781
[SPEAKER_35]: Business address, 519 Riverside Avenue, Manfred, Massachusetts, 02155.

390
00:45:03,002 --> 00:45:09,263
[SPEAKER_35]: And we have the signature, Kathleen A. Desmond, Esquire, attorney for Raising Cane's Restaurants, LLC.

391
00:45:10,464 --> 00:45:15,105
[SPEAKER_35]: So I will go to Councilor Scarpelli, and then we'll hear from you, Kathleen.

392
00:45:15,305 --> 00:45:15,925
[SPEAKER_35]: Councilor Scarpelli.

393
00:45:16,961 --> 00:45:17,701
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you, Mr. President.

394
00:45:17,741 --> 00:45:18,502
[SPEAKER_40]: I say everything's in order.

395
00:45:18,522 --> 00:45:28,268
[SPEAKER_40]: I know that we've have been there are neighboring restaurants that we've now extended their evenings to, uh, different times.

396
00:45:28,308 --> 00:45:32,571
[SPEAKER_40]: So to be consistent, I would be in favor of what your recommendations would be.

397
00:45:32,631 --> 00:45:45,220
[SPEAKER_40]: I think that if I can, Mr. President, the only amendment I would make is that we do, at least for the 1st 30 days and 60 days, we get a response back to as as I know that

398
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:49,935
[SPEAKER_40]: you're very close to some neighbors and having that early morning delivery.

399
00:45:50,943 --> 00:45:53,905
[SPEAKER_40]: I would just wanna make sure that it's not affecting the neighborhood.

400
00:45:54,025 --> 00:46:06,174
[SPEAKER_40]: So I would move to that when we get there, Mr. President, but I would put it on a 30 and 60 day review just to make sure that we're not affecting the residents in that neighborhood.

401
00:46:06,654 --> 00:46:09,296
[SPEAKER_40]: But other than that, again, we see everything in order.

402
00:46:09,376 --> 00:46:12,499
[SPEAKER_40]: So I yield to the podium.

403
00:46:12,839 --> 00:46:14,440
[SPEAKER_35]: Great, thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

404
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:19,964
[SPEAKER_35]: And just so everyone knows, Councilor Scarpelli is the chair of the Subcommittee on Licensing, Permitting and Signs.

405
00:46:20,946 --> 00:46:22,197
[SPEAKER_40]: No, I'm just the most important person.

406
00:46:24,564 --> 00:46:25,064
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you very much.

407
00:46:25,125 --> 00:46:25,445
[SPEAKER_40]: Uh Kathy.

408
00:46:25,625 --> 00:46:26,806
[SPEAKER_46]: Good evening, President Bears.

409
00:46:26,946 --> 00:46:32,571
[SPEAKER_46]: Vice President Collins City Councilors Kathleen a Desmond of 335 Main Street Stonehenge.

410
00:46:32,731 --> 00:46:39,056
[SPEAKER_46]: I'm here today with Julie Dreier, area leader of the Medford, uh, location and Sarah Holmes is also on zoom.

411
00:46:39,497 --> 00:46:41,939
[SPEAKER_46]: The property development manager with raising canes.

412
00:46:42,699 --> 00:46:47,824
[SPEAKER_46]: Um the petition before you request is indicated both an extension the hours of operation in the morning and the

413
00:46:52,067 --> 00:46:52,947
[SPEAKER_46]: to 11 p.m.

414
00:46:53,267 --> 00:46:55,528
[SPEAKER_46]: We're not seeking to extend it from 5 a.m.

415
00:46:55,728 --> 00:46:57,169
[SPEAKER_46]: to 11 p.m.

416
00:46:57,249 --> 00:47:00,670
[SPEAKER_46]: The extension is only a window in the morning from 5 a.m.

417
00:47:00,770 --> 00:47:01,530
[SPEAKER_46]: to 7 a.m.

418
00:47:01,870 --> 00:47:07,392
[SPEAKER_46]: for purposes of facilitating delivery of product to the restaurant prior to the normal business hours.

419
00:47:07,972 --> 00:47:12,053
[SPEAKER_46]: Under the terms of the current ordinance, deliveries aren't permitted prior to 7 a.m.

420
00:47:12,773 --> 00:47:21,156
[SPEAKER_46]: due in part to the loading restrictions set forth in the special permit that requires a smaller truck to accommodate the designated loading area and in part

421
00:47:21,516 --> 00:47:25,758
[SPEAKER_46]: based on the distribution routes in the greater Boston area associated with the smaller trucks.

422
00:47:26,238 --> 00:47:32,080
[SPEAKER_46]: Deliveries over the course of the last 10 months have been arriving between 10.30 and 12 p.m.

423
00:47:32,301 --> 00:47:33,421
[SPEAKER_46]: when the restaurant is open.

424
00:47:34,021 --> 00:47:49,488
[SPEAKER_46]: This has created a significant disruption to the operation of the restaurant as it's open at that time and it distracts from the staff's attention to customer service and also preparing food at a busy time of the day, one of their busier times of the day.

425
00:47:50,408 --> 00:48:01,733
[SPEAKER_46]: Typically, in this instance, in terms of disruption to the neighborhood, deliveries are made once per day by that truck, so there'll only be one truck coming in with deliveries, and those deliveries are made

426
00:48:02,652 --> 00:48:04,593
[SPEAKER_46]: five days out of seven days of the week.

427
00:48:05,233 --> 00:48:11,316
[SPEAKER_46]: The truck is a smaller truck than a typical semi, which is 55 to 56 feet long.

428
00:48:11,716 --> 00:48:14,137
[SPEAKER_46]: This is roughly 33 to 36 feet long.

429
00:48:14,917 --> 00:48:19,239
[SPEAKER_46]: It's like one of the double FedEx trucks, so it's a much smaller truck.

430
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:31,425
[SPEAKER_46]: In addition, at the time we were before you on the special permit, you had requested at that time that we'd make every effort to have our trucks come in through Commercial Street rather than to come out onto Felsway.

431
00:48:31,845 --> 00:48:37,558
[SPEAKER_46]: And speaking with my client, it's my understanding that that is in fact the case and that that is what has been occurring.

432
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:40,865
[SPEAKER_46]: If approved, my client is more than happy also to

433
00:48:42,146 --> 00:48:48,370
[SPEAKER_46]: to a condition that agrees that the trucks won't idle during delivery and those those trucks will be shut off.

434
00:48:49,211 --> 00:48:57,916
[SPEAKER_46]: It would really be helpful and make the whole process disruptive if they were able to have this five to seven window just for purposes of delivery.

435
00:48:58,937 --> 00:49:03,060
[SPEAKER_46]: The second request is to extend the evening hours of operation by one hour to 12am.

436
00:49:04,410 --> 00:49:07,673
[SPEAKER_46]: I understand that there are some restaurants who have moved to one.

437
00:49:08,214 --> 00:49:10,475
[SPEAKER_46]: We may be back at some point in order to do that.

438
00:49:10,636 --> 00:49:14,219
[SPEAKER_46]: I think at this point, they'd like to try out how the 12 a.m.

439
00:49:14,819 --> 00:49:15,440
[SPEAKER_46]: works for them.

440
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:21,765
[SPEAKER_46]: As Councilor Schiappelli has indicated, Dave's Hot Chicken, Wingstop, and the Panda Beer

441
00:49:22,278 --> 00:49:27,221
[SPEAKER_46]: along with Wendy's are all open at least until 12 a.m., sometimes much longer.

442
00:49:27,241 --> 00:49:33,104
[SPEAKER_46]: And the failure to be on par with competition puts my client at a somewhat disadvantage.

443
00:49:34,305 --> 00:49:41,149
[SPEAKER_46]: In closing, I'd just like to state that we believe that Raising Cane's has been well-received by the Medford community.

444
00:49:41,729 --> 00:49:50,054
[SPEAKER_46]: We worked closely with the Medford Police Department Traffic Unit and the City Traffic Engineer prior to the grand opening to ensure that the traffic associated

445
00:49:50,574 --> 00:49:53,276
[SPEAKER_46]: but the opening was handled successfully, and I think we did do that.

446
00:49:53,997 --> 00:50:09,909
[SPEAKER_46]: My client has also undertaken improvements in connection with the project that facilitates the overall pedestrian access to the plaza, namely the signalized driveway at Route 28 and the Felsway, and also improvements made to the plaza's entrance on Riverside Ave.

447
00:50:10,329 --> 00:50:20,097
[SPEAKER_46]: They've also been involved in the community within the last 10 months, providing donations of lemonade to the public schools, teacher appreciation swag,

448
00:50:20,781 --> 00:50:36,810
[SPEAKER_46]: public library, they were involved in the book-sharing initiative, bookmarking initiative, participated in the Polar Plunge, the Dave McGilvery Finish Strong Phrase, and recently the 8th grade celebration of their moving on ceremonies.

449
00:50:37,671 --> 00:50:44,935
[SPEAKER_46]: So, you know, Raising Canes does want to work with Medford and be of value to the community, and we'd ask that you approve the two changes.

450
00:50:46,756 --> 00:50:47,036
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you.

451
00:50:48,475 --> 00:50:50,717
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you, Councilor Desmond.

452
00:50:51,197 --> 00:50:55,201
[SPEAKER_35]: Do we have any questions for the petitioner?

453
00:51:00,445 --> 00:51:02,167
[SPEAKER_35]: Seeing none, I just had one question.

454
00:51:02,187 --> 00:51:08,172
[SPEAKER_35]: You mentioned that a condition on trucks not idling would be amenable to the applicant?

455
00:51:08,192 --> 00:51:08,252
[SPEAKER_35]: Yes.

456
00:51:09,052 --> 00:51:13,116
[SPEAKER_35]: Great, so if someone could move that along with the 30-60 day, okay.

457
00:51:17,963 --> 00:51:33,707
[SPEAKER_35]: All right, seeing no further discussion, members of the council, and we have a motion from Councilor Scarpelli to approve with a 30, 60 day review of any complaints about deliveries and a condition that the trucks will not idle, delivery trucks will not idle.

458
00:51:34,447 --> 00:51:40,569
[SPEAKER_35]: Does anyone from the public who would like to speak on this matter, either in person or on Zoom, you can come to the podium or raise your hand on Zoom.

459
00:51:47,513 --> 00:51:50,495
[SPEAKER_35]: Seeing none, Mr. Clerk, when you're ready, please call the roll.

460
00:51:53,117 --> 00:51:53,818
[SPEAKER_35]: Oh, sorry about that.

461
00:51:54,358 --> 00:51:55,419
[SPEAKER_35]: We have a second from Councilor Leming.

00:52:25,743 --> 00:52:27,264

475
00:52:27,744 --> 00:52:28,144
[SPEAKER_35]: Sorry.

476
00:52:30,445 --> 00:52:31,245
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, President Bears.

477
00:52:31,505 --> 00:52:37,827
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, after paper 25-093, I would motion to suspend the rules and take communications from the mayor.

478
00:52:38,608 --> 00:52:43,749
[SPEAKER_35]: The motion is to spend the rules to paper 25093 and communications from the mayor by Vice President Collins.

479
00:52:43,789 --> 00:52:44,350
[SPEAKER_35]: Second.

480
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:47,451
[SPEAKER_35]: Second of my councilor Leming.

[SPEAKER_41]: Councilor Lazzaro.

485
00:53:13,232 --> 00:53:13,472
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

486
00:53:14,573 --> 00:53:14,994
[SPEAKER_41]: Councilor Leming.

487
00:53:15,014 --> 00:53:15,074
[SPEAKER_41]: Yes.

488
00:53:15,914 --> 00:53:16,515
[SPEAKER_41]: Councilor Scarpelli.

489
00:53:16,535 --> 00:53:16,615
[SPEAKER_41]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_41]: Councilor Tseng.

491
00:53:19,918 --> 00:53:20,178
[SPEAKER_35]: Yes.

492
00:53:21,159 --> 00:53:21,680
[SPEAKER_41]: President Paris.

493
00:53:22,375 --> 00:53:27,817
[SPEAKER_35]: affirmative what happens in the motion passes two five zero nine three resolution to address issues on Quincy street.

494
00:53:27,937 --> 00:53:36,219
[SPEAKER_35]: It resolved that the city council discuss issues on Quincy street in particular the rat infestation, street paving, stop signs at the intersection of Quincy street and Osgoode street.

495
00:53:36,899 --> 00:53:44,601
[SPEAKER_35]: Uh Councilor Tseng and I know we do have Ann Driscoll here and this has been uh tabled a couple times so um just wanted to move on that.

496
00:53:45,021 --> 00:53:46,722
[SPEAKER_35]: Councilor Tseng and then we'll go to the podium.

497
00:53:48,269 --> 00:53:55,975
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you, um, because, um, uh, and, and, and is aware that we have a limit on, um,

498
00:53:57,297 --> 00:54:04,138
[SPEAKER_30]: public participation speaking time, we've coordinated so I can give you a fuller update about what's happening on Quincy Street.

499
00:54:04,698 --> 00:54:13,340
[SPEAKER_30]: And then I can give an update about what I've learned so far, and then Anne can give an update about how things are going from her end.

500
00:54:15,041 --> 00:54:26,663
[SPEAKER_30]: So essentially, Anne reached out to me, letting me know that on Quincy Street, there are a few problems that in summary, you've read out, Mr. President.

501
00:54:28,636 --> 00:54:44,907
[SPEAKER_30]: The first big one is a very big rat infestation, one that is at least a city hired inspector from Yankee Pest in the fall let us know, let residents know, was of a very, very big size.

502
00:54:45,008 --> 00:54:52,213
[SPEAKER_30]: I think the numbers disputed, but it's what we had heard, what residents had heard in the fall was possibly 1,000 to 3,000 rats.

503
00:54:54,294 --> 00:55:07,999
[SPEAKER_30]: um in three kind of large nests identified um one um is on a property that's currently on sale um there are two off north street behind um

504
00:55:09,835 --> 00:55:13,879
[SPEAKER_30]: Clever Green Cleaners and Stevenson's Construction.

505
00:55:15,401 --> 00:55:24,590
[SPEAKER_30]: And there are incidents of rats jumping out of closed trash cans, running through yards, being run over on the street.

506
00:55:26,351 --> 00:55:31,737
[SPEAKER_30]: And the neighborhood has been quite proactive in preventing rats.

507
00:55:33,770 --> 00:55:52,460
[SPEAKER_30]: Neighbors have been making sure that no pets are being fed outside, that pets are being cleaned up after, that there aren't any birdhouses in use, that the burrows are being stuffed with steel wool, vinegar, and ammonia, and that all shrubbery on the private property is trimmed.

508
00:55:54,541 --> 00:55:59,784
[SPEAKER_30]: But with the note that there is some overgrowth behind the cleaners that might need addressing.

509
00:56:01,275 --> 00:56:03,116
[SPEAKER_30]: Um, that's the rat issue.

510
00:56:03,697 --> 00:56:23,789
[SPEAKER_30]: And from what I understand and can give us an update as well, I understand that a few weeks ago, there were some inspectors from Yankee Pest who went, who gave a different number, a different estimate of the number of rats who were there, but did say that there are rat problems.

511
00:56:25,290 --> 00:56:27,311
[SPEAKER_30]: Director O'Connor let me know that,

512
00:56:29,269 --> 00:56:43,385
[SPEAKER_30]: that there are some residents who were contacted about boroughs being observed who didn't call the city back for follow-up treatment or inspection, and that

513
00:56:47,535 --> 00:56:58,597
[SPEAKER_30]: The inspector from Yankee Pests, who did recently visit the neighborhood, met with the owners of Stevenson's Construction and Clever Green Cleaners.

514
00:56:59,097 --> 00:57:05,318
[SPEAKER_30]: They both gave them permission to inspect the property and that both properties are free from rats at this time.

515
00:57:06,419 --> 00:57:12,540
[SPEAKER_30]: But from the rear of Clever Green Cleaners, the inspector could see rat burrows in two abundant residential properties.

516
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:24,746
[SPEAKER_30]: The inspector did take note of evidence of rats in residential properties, including rat burrows, rat damaged lattice under porches, damaged trash cans, and rat droppings.

517
00:57:25,886 --> 00:57:30,189
[SPEAKER_30]: But in the inspector's professional opinion, they don't have thousands of rats there.

518
00:57:31,249 --> 00:57:39,154
[SPEAKER_30]: They did observe that the residents have been doing well as far as they can in terms of

519
00:57:40,014 --> 00:57:52,941
[SPEAKER_30]: um, putting out rat bait, acting responsibly, doing their own rat control, um, but that, um, there might be some, um, some things that we can do as a city moving forward.

520
00:57:53,961 --> 00:58:06,448
[SPEAKER_30]: Um, the inspector also noted that some of the rat burrows that he observed were from the rear of the dry cleaners under the wood, uh, pallets in the residential backyard and that, um,

521
00:58:07,641 --> 00:58:17,026
[SPEAKER_30]: We can't, as a city, we can't service these areas with carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide unless the residents move some of their stored items.

522
00:58:18,046 --> 00:58:31,052
[SPEAKER_30]: And so their recommendations is that we work either as a city council, the board of health, or as a city to reach out to everyone in the neighborhood and coordinate rat inspections and services from Yankee Pest.

523
00:58:36,155 --> 00:58:42,280
[SPEAKER_30]: And that they would keep knocking on doors while they're there to see if they can do any inspections while they're in the neighborhood.

524
00:58:44,481 --> 00:58:52,047
[SPEAKER_30]: And they would help us put together a list of what might need to be done to control the rats.

525
00:58:54,573 --> 00:59:03,481
[SPEAKER_30]: but essentially think that if we can do a neighborhood meeting, maybe work with the board of health to do that, that would be helpful.

526
00:59:04,542 --> 00:59:05,583
[SPEAKER_30]: So that's the rat issue.

527
00:59:06,144 --> 00:59:18,315
[SPEAKER_30]: On the next two issues, I don't have as many updates, but I will say the commissioner, DPW commissioner did get back to me and say that he's putting these on the repair lists for the summer.

528
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:35,834
[SPEAKER_30]: So the first problem is that the street has from Quincy Street from where Osgoode meets Quincy to the end of the Somerville line has been patched, but the patching is coming up.

529
00:59:37,375 --> 00:59:44,281
[SPEAKER_30]: And a lot of the patches are tossing tar onto the streets and sidewalks as well.

530
00:59:46,525 --> 00:59:53,250
[SPEAKER_30]: One of the patches is seven feet by five feet, and there are nine of them in a 12-house radius.

531
00:59:54,571 --> 01:00:01,016
[SPEAKER_30]: And so the street needs a more thorough repaving, and the DPW commissioner is aware.

532
01:00:01,577 --> 01:00:08,001
[SPEAKER_30]: There are a lot of streets in Medford at this time that need similar work, but he's told me that he's put this on the list.

533
01:00:08,922 --> 01:00:20,485
[SPEAKER_30]: Um, and the last concern that Mr. school brought up to me, um, was that there is a dangerous intersection with the need for two more stop signs at the junction of Quincy and Osgood.

534
01:00:21,305 --> 01:00:27,947
[SPEAKER_30]: Um, as a lot of folks who are accessing Boston Ave and Mystic Valley Parkway speed down the street.

535
01:00:28,767 --> 01:00:31,728
[SPEAKER_30]: Um, and there have been incidents where, um,

536
01:00:33,868 --> 01:00:42,751
[SPEAKER_30]: moms who are putting their kids in car seats and people who are being picked up and dropped off after school on that corner have almost been hit.

537
01:00:43,591 --> 01:00:51,913
[SPEAKER_30]: And so I have reached out to members of the Traffic Commission about this, but I have not heard back on this yet.

538
01:00:59,276 --> 01:01:00,276
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

539
01:01:01,156 --> 01:01:03,197
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm going to go to Anne at the podium.

540
01:01:03,337 --> 01:01:03,457
[SPEAKER_35]: Anne,

541
01:01:03,988 --> 01:01:12,200
[SPEAKER_35]: I think Councilor Tseng talked about a lot, but we have a three-minute limit, so I'm going to give you your full three minutes, and then you can have an additional minute after that.

542
01:01:14,136 --> 01:01:18,441
[SPEAKER_35]: unless some but we have to let someone else speak for us if they want to, and then you can come back for another minute.

543
01:01:18,461 --> 01:01:18,601
[SPEAKER_35]: Right.

544
01:01:18,902 --> 01:01:28,192
[SPEAKER_23]: I mean, I'm Andrews go 77 Quincy Street, and I'd like to thank Councilman saying, for his help in this matter we've had contact several times.

545
01:01:28,793 --> 01:01:34,279
[SPEAKER_23]: The inspector did indeed come to the street, and I saw he was taking pictures of my husband's bird houses.

546
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:36,120
[SPEAKER_23]: They are not bird feeders.

547
01:01:36,501 --> 01:01:39,742
[SPEAKER_23]: And actually, they're not occupied at this very moment.

548
01:01:39,782 --> 01:01:42,082
[SPEAKER_23]: So I'd have to say they're not much of a danger.

549
01:01:42,423 --> 01:01:45,164
[SPEAKER_23]: But there are no bird feeders on this street.

550
01:01:45,564 --> 01:01:48,205
[SPEAKER_23]: We have done everything we can in the neighborhood with the rats.

551
01:01:48,665 --> 01:01:57,048
[SPEAKER_23]: And they are an ever-present danger to our safety, with people screaming and 90-year-old women screaming as one jumped out.

552
01:01:58,503 --> 01:02:04,329
[SPEAKER_23]: I brought copies of what I was going to say, but the councilman has already said it very well.

553
01:02:04,809 --> 01:02:12,036
[SPEAKER_23]: And so I'm going to leave 11 copies over there for everybody to read all the incidents we've had and some pictures of what's going on in the street.

554
01:02:12,337 --> 01:02:13,598
[SPEAKER_23]: I also like show and tell.

555
01:02:13,938 --> 01:02:18,322
[SPEAKER_23]: So I brought a piece of the tar that's been spewing up on the sidewalks.

556
01:02:18,823 --> 01:02:22,907
[SPEAKER_23]: So child or walking their dogs, we have a lot of dog walkers in our neighborhood.

557
01:02:24,079 --> 01:02:27,605
[SPEAKER_23]: they could be hurt by this stuff.

558
01:02:28,166 --> 01:02:30,370
[SPEAKER_23]: It's been so many patches, it's ridiculous.

559
01:02:31,015 --> 01:02:31,895
[SPEAKER_23]: It's beyond patching.

560
01:02:32,236 --> 01:02:37,598
[SPEAKER_23]: And the stop signs are really a necessity because we are almost in a direct line from Tufts University.

561
01:02:37,978 --> 01:02:41,800
[SPEAKER_23]: Tesla to Osgoode is a little jog, and then straight down to North Street.

562
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:50,124
[SPEAKER_23]: So people trying to get on Mr. Gav or to Boston Ave, they just, it's like the Indiana Speedway.

563
01:02:50,864 --> 01:02:55,327
[SPEAKER_23]: So with that, Councilman Tseng did, he stole all my material.

564
01:02:55,687 --> 01:02:56,887
[SPEAKER_23]: So thank you for listening.

565
01:02:56,927 --> 01:02:58,168
[SPEAKER_23]: I'll just put my stuff over there.

566
01:02:58,792 --> 01:02:59,492
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you, Anne.

567
01:03:00,313 --> 01:03:02,454
[SPEAKER_35]: And as a neighbor, I'm on Auburn Street, I know.

568
01:03:03,495 --> 01:03:05,956
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm right at the house at the bottom of the hill on North Street.

569
01:03:06,036 --> 01:03:11,080
[SPEAKER_35]: So, you know, I don't know how people are going 45, 50 miles an hour and making that turn, but they are.

570
01:03:11,180 --> 01:03:14,342
[SPEAKER_35]: So I'm really hoping we'll get some more safety and speed improvements in the area.

571
01:03:15,542 --> 01:03:15,782
[SPEAKER_35]: Thanks.

572
01:03:17,403 --> 01:03:22,146
[SPEAKER_35]: Is there anyone else would like to speak on this item from the public, either in person or on Zoom?

573
01:03:22,286 --> 01:03:26,369
[SPEAKER_35]: Feel free to come to the podium in person or raise your hand on Zoom.

574
01:03:27,410 --> 01:03:27,730
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

575
01:03:29,186 --> 01:03:30,707
[SPEAKER_35]: Name and address for the record, please.

576
01:03:30,747 --> 01:03:31,747
[SPEAKER_35]: And you'll have three minutes.

577
01:03:32,427 --> 01:03:34,828
[SPEAKER_44]: Anne Castner Williams, 79 Capon Street.

578
01:03:34,848 --> 01:03:36,368
[SPEAKER_44]: I just want to thank Ms.

579
01:03:36,388 --> 01:03:37,649
[SPEAKER_44]: Driscoll for raising these issues.

580
01:03:37,689 --> 01:03:39,689
[SPEAKER_44]: I can speak as a dog walker.

581
01:03:39,709 --> 01:03:42,970
[SPEAKER_44]: I've also noticed the issue of tar being everywhere.

582
01:03:42,990 --> 01:03:45,331
[SPEAKER_44]: I do have to look out for my dog's safety.

583
01:03:45,351 --> 01:03:49,332
[SPEAKER_44]: And I'm also just as concerned about the amount of speeding on Quincy Street.

584
01:03:49,372 --> 01:03:51,213
[SPEAKER_44]: I live at the intersection of Quincy and Capon.

585
01:03:51,713 --> 01:03:52,774
[SPEAKER_44]: That is our main dog route.

586
01:03:53,074 --> 01:03:56,256
[SPEAKER_44]: And everything that Mr. Oskol says is a concern of mine.

587
01:03:56,296 --> 01:03:57,716
[SPEAKER_44]: I didn't know that this was being raised here.

588
01:03:58,677 --> 01:04:04,120
[SPEAKER_44]: But I do think that the addition of those two stop signs and significant attention to that road would make a big difference in the community.

589
01:04:04,300 --> 01:04:04,640
[SPEAKER_44]: Thank you.

590
01:04:04,660 --> 01:04:06,121
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you so much.

591
01:04:11,984 --> 01:04:16,246
[SPEAKER_35]: Any further discussion on this resolution by members of the public or by councillors?

592
01:04:16,306 --> 01:04:17,167
[SPEAKER_35]: Vice President Collins.

593
01:04:19,316 --> 01:04:33,354
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, President Bears I just want to thank and again for bringing these issues forward to the council and for working with Councilor Tseng on these issues on your street unfortunately we do know they're certainly not isolated to this part of Medford this term we have been seeking to.

594
01:04:34,455 --> 01:04:48,120
[SPEAKER_24]: work with the administration to accelerate some of the road and control measures that are within our jurisdiction and I think as you spoke to and as Councilor Tseng spoke to, to really get at the root of the problem requires that holistic approach.

595
01:04:48,501 --> 01:04:51,882
[SPEAKER_24]: So I think a neighborhood meeting is a really important step in this process.

596
01:04:51,922 --> 01:04:54,363
[SPEAKER_24]: I know that the road and control issue is not the only thing that you're dealing with,

597
01:04:55,484 --> 01:05:13,183
[SPEAKER_24]: But it's certainly where we've been working with the mayor's office with the Board of Health quite collaboratively especially last year to try to update our rodent control ordinance to update our wildlife feeding ordinance overgrowth ordinance, and really just to show up for education efforts because when there are

598
01:05:13,603 --> 01:05:25,285
[SPEAKER_24]: dilapidated properties residents who don't know how big of an issue, trash on residential properties can be that can really accumulate to a street wide problem so I wanted to thank my colleague and thank the resident for working on this.

599
01:05:25,945 --> 01:05:36,087
[SPEAKER_24]: And I hope that certainly by the end of the term we can have those three ordinances update to give our to the city administration more latitude to deal with the pest issues all across Medford.

600
01:05:36,407 --> 01:05:37,567
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, I motion to approve.

601
01:05:39,247 --> 01:05:42,648
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you, Vice President Collins on the motion approved by Vice President Collins seconded by.

602
01:05:43,995 --> 01:05:45,896
[SPEAKER_35]: Seconded by Councilor Leming.

603
01:05:45,916 --> 01:05:46,797
[SPEAKER_35]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

604
01:05:50,940 --> 01:05:51,921
[SPEAKER_41]: Councilor Callahan is absent.

605
01:05:52,521 --> 01:05:53,302
[SPEAKER_41]: Vice President Collins.

606
01:05:54,363 --> 01:05:55,203
[SPEAKER_41]: Councilor Lazzaro.

607
01:05:55,764 --> 01:05:56,024
[SPEAKER_41]: Yes.

608
01:05:57,505 --> 01:05:58,005
[SPEAKER_41]: Councilor Leming.

609
01:05:58,786 --> 01:05:59,487
[SPEAKER_41]: Councilor Scarpelli.

610
01:06:01,248 --> 01:06:01,768
[SPEAKER_41]: Councilor Tseng.

611
01:06:02,509 --> 01:06:02,769
[SPEAKER_35]: Yes.

612
01:06:04,010 --> 01:06:04,570
[SPEAKER_41]: President Bears.

613
01:06:04,811 --> 01:06:04,991
[SPEAKER_35]: Yes.

614
01:06:05,071 --> 01:06:06,892
[SPEAKER_35]: Six in the affirmative, one absent, the motion passes.

615
01:06:07,673 --> 01:06:07,973
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

616
01:06:09,878 --> 01:06:23,798
[SPEAKER_35]: Communications from the mayor 25106 appropriation of free cash submitted by brand new brand new current use of free cash to your president bears and city councilors are special request and recommend that your honorable body approved the appropriation of free cash the amount

617
01:06:24,648 --> 01:06:38,542
[SPEAKER_35]: of $8,022,021.80 on the following items, $8,000,000 to the Capital Stabilization Fund, given the decades-long backlog of capital improvements needed by the city of Medford, partially outlined below, and $22,021.80 for washers, dryers and appurtenances, and a stove for the Fire Department.

618
01:06:43,266 --> 01:06:44,768
[SPEAKER_35]: A balance of free cash before this vote is $20,023,923.94.

619
01:06:45,509 --> 01:06:56,541
[SPEAKER_35]: As our honorable body knows, there is a long list of needs by the city, including but not limited to the below matters for which we'll be starting the complete review and planning this summer.

620
01:06:56,922 --> 01:07:00,846
[SPEAKER_35]: The numbers shown are estimates and this list does not include water and sewer infrastructure work that lies ahead.

621
01:07:01,767 --> 01:07:26,250
[SPEAKER_35]: $200 million street and sidewalk repair backlog, $15 million for Freedom Way, $4 million for Oak Grove design and construction, $3 million for equipment and vehicles, $3 million for accounting software, $1.5 million for City Hall ADA bathroom renovations, $1 million for Hagner Center, $125,000 for dive equipment, an unknown amount for City Hall HVAC costs, which, as we're all experiencing now, is much needed.

622
01:07:27,408 --> 01:07:29,350
[SPEAKER_35]: respectfully submitted Brianna Lingo, current mayor.

623
01:07:29,850 --> 01:07:31,871
[SPEAKER_35]: I saw the chief of, there's the chief of staff.

624
01:07:32,812 --> 01:07:36,315
[SPEAKER_35]: If there's anything you'd like to add, then we'll go to discussion.

625
01:07:37,416 --> 01:07:39,738
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening, President Bears and members of the council.

626
01:07:39,818 --> 01:07:41,119
[SPEAKER_14]: Nothing specific to add.

627
01:07:41,559 --> 01:07:46,703
[SPEAKER_14]: This is effectively a continuation from our discussion at the June 10th meeting.

628
01:07:46,883 --> 01:07:48,224
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm happy to answer any questions.

629
01:07:49,645 --> 01:07:49,905
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

630
01:07:49,925 --> 01:07:51,487
[SPEAKER_35]: Do we have any questions from members of the council?

631
01:07:55,009 --> 01:07:55,710
[SPEAKER_40]: Councilor Scarpelli.

632
01:07:56,511 --> 01:08:00,034
[SPEAKER_40]: Today, Madam Chief of Staff, was $22 million in free cash?

633
01:08:00,995 --> 01:08:02,136
[SPEAKER_40]: Is that $20 million?

634
01:08:02,156 --> 01:08:03,397
[SPEAKER_40]: $20 million, yes.

635
01:08:03,838 --> 01:08:06,921
[SPEAKER_40]: And then we're asking for eight to be distributed?

636
01:08:07,982 --> 01:08:08,382
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, set aside.

637
01:08:08,422 --> 01:08:09,483
[SPEAKER_40]: So we'll use the $12 million.

638
01:08:09,563 --> 01:08:19,873
[SPEAKER_40]: So that falls in line to keep our bond rating where it needs to be and enough free cash in case of any emergency that's needed, right?

639
01:08:20,415 --> 01:08:23,676
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, through you, President Bears, I think that's a reasonable way to describe it.

640
01:08:23,836 --> 01:08:28,518
[SPEAKER_14]: The bond rating companies are looking for a decent amount in free cash.

641
01:08:28,558 --> 01:08:39,761
[SPEAKER_14]: And so that allows us to carry over that amount and also place some funding aside so that we can go through the process of distributing it for capital needs on an as-needed basis.

642
01:08:41,221 --> 01:08:41,522
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

643
01:08:41,662 --> 01:08:42,002
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

644
01:08:42,182 --> 01:08:42,802
[SPEAKER_35]: Councilor Lazzaro.

645
01:08:45,752 --> 01:08:46,312
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

646
01:08:47,894 --> 01:08:57,300
[SPEAKER_25]: Chief of Staff Nazarian, can you explain to me the process for going through the prioritization of the rest of the items as listed?

647
01:08:57,640 --> 01:09:06,767
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm sure it won't be the rest of the items, but you mentioned through the summer, if you could just tell me what that process might look like.

648
01:09:09,897 --> 01:09:11,960
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Lazzaro.

649
01:09:11,980 --> 01:09:16,525
[SPEAKER_14]: Through you, President Bears, I don't think there's a very quick and clear answer that I can provide.

650
01:09:16,545 --> 01:09:23,574
[SPEAKER_14]: It would include meetings between myself, the mayor, our finance director, any department heads that we need to incorporate.

651
01:09:23,594 --> 01:09:26,678
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, frankly, we're presently very

652
01:09:27,997 --> 01:09:28,397
[SPEAKER_14]: the budget process.

653
01:09:28,417 --> 01:09:28,457
[SPEAKER_14]: Um.

654
01:09:29,337 --> 01:09:30,998
[SPEAKER_14]: Busy with a number of issues.

655
01:09:31,718 --> 01:09:36,359
[SPEAKER_14]: Thankfully the this council has approved the budget, so that's not one of the items on the agenda right now.

656
01:09:36,819 --> 01:09:41,041
[SPEAKER_14]: Necessarily we do want to follow through with the.

657
01:09:41,081 --> 01:09:42,321
[SPEAKER_14]: Government finance officials.

658
01:09:43,681 --> 01:09:51,564
[SPEAKER_14]: Association budget book for a third budget award, hopefully, so that will be something that will be doing over the summer, but it's not quite nearly as

659
01:09:58,479 --> 01:10:05,103
[SPEAKER_14]: The other issues that are taking a considerable amount of time is litigation in front of the city right now, which is being defended.

660
01:10:05,203 --> 01:10:07,584
[SPEAKER_14]: So I figured I'd mention that right now.

661
01:10:07,604 --> 01:10:08,945
[SPEAKER_14]: I hope that answers your question.

662
01:10:08,985 --> 01:10:18,351
[SPEAKER_14]: I should have some better information as the summer really unfolds at this point, and we begin those meetings and those processes.

663
01:10:22,193 --> 01:10:23,153
[SPEAKER_25]: President Bears, if I may?

664
01:10:23,173 --> 01:10:26,035
[SPEAKER_35]: You have the floor.

665
01:10:27,252 --> 01:10:27,592
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

666
01:10:29,634 --> 01:10:53,354
[SPEAKER_25]: I just wanted to, as important as I think it may be to continue working on a budget book, I think that prioritizing, putting additional amounts of free cash into further helping the city invest in its

667
01:10:55,696 --> 01:11:08,948
[SPEAKER_25]: our department beyond appliances, I think, would be something I would encourage the administration to look into with greater urgency and haste.

668
01:11:09,368 --> 01:11:10,569
[SPEAKER_25]: I've been

669
01:11:11,899 --> 01:11:24,688
[SPEAKER_25]: talking, I feel like I've been asking for the dive equipment in a little bit of an annoying way.

670
01:11:24,848 --> 01:11:27,470
[SPEAKER_25]: And I'm kind of OK with that, I guess.

671
01:11:28,050 --> 01:11:37,617
[SPEAKER_25]: But I think that we have the capacity to invest in that and appliances at the same time, perhaps, because it's not a huge amount of money.

672
01:11:40,559 --> 01:11:50,442
[SPEAKER_25]: think that even if there was one person that was saved from drowning by a dive team over the course of 10 years, it would have been worth $125,000.

673
01:11:50,502 --> 01:12:05,206
[SPEAKER_25]: And that delaying it isn't necessary or something that I would think is pertinent or useful for the city of Medford.

674
01:12:05,386 --> 01:12:07,027
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm putting that out there for now.

675
01:12:08,347 --> 01:12:33,377
[SPEAKER_25]: I would also say that listing two times now over the last two meetings how many items we need to spend money on for the benefit of the city council and for the public while useful is highlighting that some of these items are a few

676
01:12:34,783 --> 01:12:41,126
[SPEAKER_25]: tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars, and some of these items are hundreds of millions of dollars.

677
01:12:41,886 --> 01:12:44,408
[SPEAKER_25]: So it really puts into stark contrast

678
01:12:46,130 --> 01:12:50,593
[SPEAKER_25]: which items we're capable of paying for now and which items we are not capable of paying for now.

679
01:12:52,073 --> 01:13:00,037
[SPEAKER_25]: My understanding is best practice is to have five to 7% of your annual budget in cash reserves.

680
01:13:01,298 --> 01:13:06,660
[SPEAKER_25]: $20 million is not five to 7% of our annual budget.

681
01:13:07,401 --> 01:13:07,721
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

682
01:13:09,902 --> 01:13:10,322
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you.

683
01:13:10,382 --> 01:13:11,263
[SPEAKER_33]: Vice President Collins.

684
01:13:12,923 --> 01:13:14,144
[SPEAKER_33]: Oh, there you go.

685
01:13:16,107 --> 01:13:17,307
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, President Bears.

686
01:13:18,007 --> 01:13:18,667
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you for being here.

687
01:13:20,708 --> 01:13:33,990
[SPEAKER_24]: I just wanted to, for the benefit of the public, and since we're talking about this again, wanted to restate something that was brought up at our last meeting about free cash appropriations, kind of to piggyback off of what Councilor Lazzaro was just saying.

688
01:13:34,571 --> 01:13:41,552
[SPEAKER_24]: For myself, I think, and I know this is in the queue of projects that the administration is planning to work on over the summer, I think it would be very, very useful

689
01:13:42,652 --> 01:14:01,530
[SPEAKER_24]: to see at least a prioritization plan that deals with these kind of separate tiers of spending projects separately, like Councilor Lazzaro was saying, we know there are some projects that are very, very impactful, that are small dollars compared to some of these multi, multi-million dollar capital expenses.

690
01:14:02,230 --> 01:14:17,308
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know for myself and apparently I'm not the only council and I know that they're members of the public saying, if this is, you know, point 5% of our operating budget or very very small percent of what we ought to have in cash reserves, what is the justification for not spending it especially if it's something that would be.

691
01:14:17,949 --> 01:14:21,074
[SPEAKER_24]: materially useful to the residents in the short term.

692
01:14:21,094 --> 01:14:33,851
[SPEAKER_24]: So I understand we don't have that information today, but as we continue to talk more about this over the summer and hopefully look at a more discreet plan by the end of the summer, I'll be really, I just want to restate, I'll be really eager to see that plan for

693
01:14:35,373 --> 01:14:49,921
[SPEAKER_24]: essentially, what are we going to see the plan for the appropriations and do that prioritization and filtering action through all of these plans, we know all the stuff that we plan to spend money on, I think people and myself, at least very eager to see what is the justification for what we're holding back on.

694
01:14:50,501 --> 01:14:57,865
[SPEAKER_24]: And for those smaller things that are easier to spend on and get in motion, what is the justification for pulling the trigger this year, next year in two years in five years?

695
01:14:59,045 --> 01:14:59,326
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

696
01:15:01,647 --> 01:15:02,147
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

697
01:15:02,367 --> 01:15:03,508
[SPEAKER_35]: Chief of Staff Nazarian.

698
01:15:04,163 --> 01:15:10,246
[SPEAKER_14]: Just to comment broadly and briefly on Councilor Lazzaro's comments and Councilor Collins' comments.

699
01:15:10,606 --> 01:15:14,808
[SPEAKER_14]: I think largely we're discussing some of the things we discussed at the June 10th meeting.

700
01:15:14,888 --> 01:15:21,851
[SPEAKER_14]: And I wanna just tell the council that the comments are heard and the comments are taken back and we will be working on this.

701
01:15:22,311 --> 01:15:29,195
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't disagree largely that we have a stark contrast as Councilor Lazzaro stated in terms of

702
01:15:29,915 --> 01:15:41,252
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, some of our smaller amounts, some of our maybe maybe medium sized amounts and some of the things that are just so large that they're so difficult to fund and complete and require you know multi year planning.

703
01:15:43,604 --> 01:15:59,520
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't want anyone to be under the impression that the budget book is is taking a priority over this I was just simply mentioning that we're on the significant downhill slope of the FYI 26 budget, and it's just a process and and that process is one for transparency, as the council knows

704
01:16:00,481 --> 01:16:06,327
[SPEAKER_14]: government finance officials, association rates communities who submit their budget books for purposes of transparency.

705
01:16:06,647 --> 01:16:19,318
[SPEAKER_14]: The city won the budget award in two years, one was last year and one was a number of years ago, and it's important that we continue those things because we want to continue having a transparent budget.

706
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:24,221
[SPEAKER_14]: Those are my only comments, and I hear the council's comments.

707
01:16:24,261 --> 01:16:27,121
[SPEAKER_14]: I won't dive into each of them specifically.

708
01:16:27,141 --> 01:16:34,203
[SPEAKER_14]: I need to stop using that word, but I do want you all to know that I hear you and we are working on it.

709
01:16:34,643 --> 01:16:38,003
[SPEAKER_14]: It is just a little bit more complicated than it sometimes seems on the surface.

710
01:16:40,164 --> 01:16:41,144
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you, Madam Chief of Staff.

711
01:16:41,364 --> 01:16:42,824
[SPEAKER_35]: Any further discussion by members of the Council?

712
01:16:45,045 --> 01:16:46,845
[SPEAKER_35]: Seeing none, is there a motion?

713
01:16:49,657 --> 01:16:52,099
[SPEAKER_35]: The motion to approve by Vice President Collins, seconded by.

714
01:16:53,220 --> 01:16:54,300
[SPEAKER_35]: Seconded by Councilor Leming.

715
01:16:55,081 --> 01:16:56,462
[SPEAKER_35]: Move to public comment.

716
01:16:57,303 --> 01:17:03,607
[SPEAKER_35]: We'll take public comment in person or on Zoom on this item for, we'll go, each person will have three minutes.

717
01:17:04,128 --> 01:17:12,314
[SPEAKER_35]: If you'd like to comment on this item, you can come to the podium if you're in the chamber, or you can raise your hand on Zoom and we'll alternate between in-person and Zoom.

718
01:17:13,154 --> 01:17:18,338
[SPEAKER_35]: Seeing no hands on Zoom and one person at the podium, name and address for the record, please, and you'll have three minutes.

719
01:17:19,318 --> 01:17:21,300
[SPEAKER_37]: Good evening, Mr. Alejo, Forty Robinson Road.

720
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:38,453
[SPEAKER_37]: So for members of the public who might not be following, this letter from the mayor is requesting an appropriation of $8 million from our free cash balance, so over-budgeted taxpayer dollars, from a balance total of over $20 million for capital improvements.

721
01:17:39,094 --> 01:17:46,380
[SPEAKER_37]: And as the letter indicates, this includes street and sidewalk improvements, Oak Grove Cemetery repairs, equipment and vehicles.

722
01:17:47,584 --> 01:17:54,548
[SPEAKER_37]: If you recall, during the campaign to override Proposition 2 1⁄2 and raise our taxes, money was requested to fund the Department of Public Works.

723
01:17:55,309 --> 01:18:08,577
[SPEAKER_37]: I'll quote from the ballot question that was approved, quote, general operations of the Department of Public Works, in parentheses, 500,000, including but not limited to additional staff for road and sidewalk infrastructure repairs.

724
01:18:08,617 --> 01:18:09,458
[SPEAKER_37]: That was question seven.

725
01:18:10,663 --> 01:18:21,634
[SPEAKER_37]: You also have to recall that supporters of the yes vote, including some members of this council repeatedly dismissed that we could use free cash as a substitute for raising taxes but you have to look and see what's happening here.

726
01:18:22,135 --> 01:18:28,981
[SPEAKER_37]: We're using $8 million in free cash, that's what this comes down to, or at least putting it aside in a separate fund for that purpose.

727
01:18:29,842 --> 01:18:33,906
[SPEAKER_37]: So I just as rhetorically you know why, given the amount of free cash that we had.

728
01:18:34,707 --> 01:18:45,106
[SPEAKER_37]: that the people of our city were told raising taxes for $500,000 DPW money was necessary, and that we did suffer apocalyptic funding shortages if we didn't do it.

729
01:18:46,013 --> 01:18:51,595
[SPEAKER_37]: So this isn't the first time though, that since the election, the free cash has been used to meet city funding needs.

730
01:18:52,456 --> 01:19:02,940
[SPEAKER_37]: At a actually recent meeting I spoke at, the mayor requested 5 million from our free cash for HVAC repairs for the schools, another about 200,000 for security upgrades across the public schools as well.

731
01:19:03,221 --> 01:19:04,501
[SPEAKER_37]: And that was approved by this council.

732
01:19:05,502 --> 01:19:11,604
[SPEAKER_37]: So I view this in addition to what I discussed previously as just yet another vindication of that free cash argument.

733
01:19:11,844 --> 01:19:12,685
[SPEAKER_37]: I think it's unfortunate

734
01:19:13,265 --> 01:19:14,986
[SPEAKER_37]: taxpayers have to suffer as a result.

735
01:19:15,366 --> 01:19:18,126
[SPEAKER_37]: So we can only hope that voters aren't misled again.

736
01:19:18,186 --> 01:19:21,447
[SPEAKER_37]: And what I think is a likely event, we see another override on the ballot.

737
01:19:21,927 --> 01:19:22,268
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

738
01:19:24,208 --> 01:19:24,668
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

739
01:19:24,808 --> 01:19:26,609
[SPEAKER_35]: Just wanted to clarify on that.

740
01:19:27,929 --> 01:19:33,991
[SPEAKER_35]: The funding from question seven was used to hire permanent staff in the DPW.

741
01:19:34,711 --> 01:19:38,952
[SPEAKER_35]: And these funds, these funds aren't, as you noted, aren't being appropriated to any specific project.

742
01:19:38,972 --> 01:19:40,773
[SPEAKER_35]: They're being placed in the stabilization fund.

743
01:19:42,448 --> 01:19:48,829
[SPEAKER_35]: under the archaic ways of our state law, money placed in the stabilization fund can be appropriated at any time.

744
01:19:49,369 --> 01:19:58,011
[SPEAKER_35]: But free cash balance, which is essentially just a different reserve account, can only be appropriated after a free cash balance is certified by the State Department of Revenue.

745
01:19:58,031 --> 01:20:00,331
[SPEAKER_35]: And that generally happens in March.

746
01:20:00,511 --> 01:20:03,832
[SPEAKER_35]: So we wouldn't be able to access the funds until that.

747
01:20:03,952 --> 01:20:09,053
[SPEAKER_35]: So for several months, if it stayed in free cash, but in the stabilization fund, if the administration

748
01:20:09,733 --> 01:20:15,376
[SPEAKER_35]: comes up with the free cash plan or makes an appropriation request, we can consider that at any time during the fiscal year.

749
01:20:15,856 --> 01:20:26,121
[SPEAKER_35]: So it's about putting our reserve funds in a place where they can be used instead of in the free cash account where they can't be used until the next certification next spring.

750
01:20:26,221 --> 01:20:32,504
[SPEAKER_35]: So if it isn't moved, it means that the funds are not able to be used for the next nine months, even if there's a priority to use them.

751
01:20:33,624 --> 01:20:34,565
[SPEAKER_35]: And yeah, I mean,

752
01:20:35,616 --> 01:20:36,617
[SPEAKER_35]: We have massive needs.

753
01:20:36,717 --> 01:20:44,901
[SPEAKER_35]: That was part of the discussion in the override campaign last year, but the road and sidewalk funding under question seven was used to hire staff who will be working for the city.

754
01:20:44,921 --> 01:20:50,344
[SPEAKER_35]: And that's an ongoing expense and therefore requires ongoing funding.

755
01:20:51,105 --> 01:20:58,689
[SPEAKER_35]: These dollars, what we've appropriated this year and what's potentially being proposed in the future would be for one time expenses.

756
01:20:58,789 --> 01:20:59,670
[SPEAKER_35]: So that's the difference.

757
01:21:00,690 --> 01:21:03,072
[SPEAKER_35]: I'll go to the podium.

758
01:21:04,383 --> 01:21:07,184
[SPEAKER_35]: Since I see no hands on Zoom, name and address for the record, please.

759
01:21:07,204 --> 01:21:08,744
[SPEAKER_31]: You have three minutes.

760
01:21:08,764 --> 01:21:09,724
[SPEAKER_31]: Nate Merritt, 373 Riverside Ave.

761
01:21:10,405 --> 01:21:13,485
[SPEAKER_31]: Question for you through the chair, just for clarification.

762
01:21:13,945 --> 01:21:29,049
[SPEAKER_31]: The $22,000 for washers, dryers, and appurtenances and a stove, I heard a Councilor mention they were appliances, but are those for uniforms, or are those for gear washers and dryers, which are a completely different piece of equipment?

763
01:21:29,189 --> 01:21:31,010
[SPEAKER_31]: You don't mix bloody clothes with

764
01:21:31,730 --> 01:21:32,290
[SPEAKER_31]: turnout gear.

765
01:21:32,911 --> 01:21:34,391
[SPEAKER_31]: So just for the public's knowledge.

766
01:21:35,311 --> 01:21:39,133
[SPEAKER_35]: I do believe we have the fire chief who's raised his hand so I will take the fire chief on zoom.

767
01:21:39,553 --> 01:21:40,073
[SPEAKER_35]: Chief Evans.

768
01:21:45,315 --> 01:21:46,596
[SPEAKER_43]: Hi, thank you for your question.

769
01:21:47,056 --> 01:21:47,936
[SPEAKER_43]: I appreciate that.

770
01:21:48,537 --> 01:21:58,220
[SPEAKER_43]: So those are washer and dryers for the individuals that are working at the time to wash uniforms that have been soiled in the course of doing their duties at work.

771
01:21:58,260 --> 01:21:59,741
[SPEAKER_43]: You know getting

772
01:22:00,904 --> 01:22:07,728
[SPEAKER_43]: anything possibly on the uniforms from carcinogens to blood or anything like that, that they don't want to be taking home to their families.

773
01:22:08,268 --> 01:22:13,871
[SPEAKER_43]: So they can wash those particular clothing, uh, in those washes and dryers at the stations.

774
01:22:19,214 --> 01:22:19,434
[SPEAKER_35]: Yep.

775
01:22:21,075 --> 01:22:22,216
[SPEAKER_35]: Councilor Scarpelli.

776
01:22:22,556 --> 01:22:26,518
[SPEAKER_40]: We're asking for a regular washing machines for the stations, correct?

777
01:22:27,436 --> 01:22:29,176
[SPEAKER_40]: It's not, it's not for the turnout gear.

778
01:22:29,616 --> 01:22:32,277
[SPEAKER_40]: I think you're confusing us chief.

779
01:22:33,097 --> 01:22:33,717
[SPEAKER_43]: That is correct.

780
01:22:33,797 --> 01:22:34,798
[SPEAKER_43]: It's not turnout gear.

781
01:22:34,858 --> 01:22:39,299
[SPEAKER_43]: It's the, it's the uniforms that they wear regularly in the station.

782
01:22:39,439 --> 01:22:43,760
[SPEAKER_43]: Otherwise from, you know, uh, the turnout gear is for fighting fires itself.

783
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:50,301
[SPEAKER_43]: And the uniform is just going to medical calls and, and every other type of call that they go out throughout the day.

784
01:22:51,465 --> 01:22:51,765
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

785
01:22:52,405 --> 01:22:52,785
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

786
01:22:53,445 --> 01:22:54,186
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you for clarifying.

787
01:22:54,226 --> 01:23:00,067
[SPEAKER_31]: Only in that just for general public who isn't in the fire service doesn't necessarily understand that, hey, these guys are just trying to wash their clothes.

788
01:23:00,087 --> 01:23:01,267
[SPEAKER_31]: Why are we spending 22 grand?

789
01:23:02,287 --> 01:23:04,227
[SPEAKER_31]: It's because of what the chief said.

790
01:23:04,327 --> 01:23:15,789
[SPEAKER_31]: So my other question, and it relates to a different ask of the mayor, but to my predecessor's point, there's an ask to transfer $267,000 from the DPW and highway budget to other parts of the salary.

791
01:23:20,528 --> 01:23:27,350
[SPEAKER_31]: But yet when you total up all the line items, but yet we're saying that we have shovel, you know, like needs now for DPW.

792
01:23:27,390 --> 01:23:34,652
[SPEAKER_31]: So I guess I question like, what is going on that half the override ask is now asking to be transferred to different areas of the budget.

793
01:23:35,332 --> 01:23:36,933
[SPEAKER_35]: So that's the next paper.

794
01:23:37,113 --> 01:23:39,054
[SPEAKER_35]: So we'll take it up on the next paper.

795
01:23:41,394 --> 01:23:43,755
[SPEAKER_35]: I have Councilor Leming, then Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Leming.

796
01:23:46,900 --> 01:23:48,801
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, I'm gonna just repeat a lot of points, sorry.

797
01:23:48,821 --> 01:24:01,189
[SPEAKER_29]: There's a lot of people here that are trying to talk about a couple of other papers we have, and I feel like we've gone over the civics lesson a few dozen times in council by now, but I'm just gonna repeat the point.

798
01:24:02,050 --> 01:24:09,875
[SPEAKER_29]: Free cash is used for one-time expenses, capital projects, which is what is on this paper.

799
01:24:10,676 --> 01:24:11,416
[SPEAKER_29]: The override,

800
01:24:13,694 --> 01:24:20,739
[SPEAKER_29]: believe we're talking about question seven, which put $500,000 a year to the DPW that is used for ongoing expenses.

801
01:24:21,399 --> 01:24:26,503
[SPEAKER_29]: You can't dip into free cash to pay staff because those are year to year costs.

802
01:24:27,123 --> 01:24:32,066
[SPEAKER_29]: Now every city has usually between usually over budgets by about three to 5%.

803
01:24:32,707 --> 01:24:37,590
[SPEAKER_29]: And then that is then put into free cash, which then can then collect over time so that we can then put

804
01:24:38,395 --> 01:24:44,958
[SPEAKER_29]: that amount into things like sidewalks, HVAC systems, one-time capital projects.

805
01:24:45,858 --> 01:24:48,539
[SPEAKER_29]: The override didn't go towards that.

806
01:24:48,579 --> 01:24:52,741
[SPEAKER_29]: That's going towards hiring three in-house road repair crew members.

807
01:24:54,181 --> 01:25:04,206
[SPEAKER_29]: I feel like there's probably a lot of folks in this room who haven't heard us have this same conversation literally dozens of times by now, but I just want to clarify that that's what's going on here.

808
01:25:04,346 --> 01:25:04,686
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

809
01:25:05,086 --> 01:25:05,446
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

810
01:25:05,526 --> 01:25:06,326
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Scarpelli.

811
01:25:08,947 --> 01:25:13,550
[SPEAKER_40]: to the constituents that spoke or anybody else that's here, your time is respected.

812
01:25:14,031 --> 01:25:17,573
[SPEAKER_40]: So if any time you come to that podium, the time isn't wasted.

813
01:25:17,734 --> 01:25:23,598
[SPEAKER_40]: We understand there's other things on the agenda, but what you say is just as important as anybody else here.

814
01:25:23,658 --> 01:25:27,641
[SPEAKER_40]: So whether we have to say it 30 times or under times, that's your podium.

815
01:25:27,821 --> 01:25:28,822
[SPEAKER_40]: So feel free to do that.

816
01:25:29,470 --> 01:25:35,554
[SPEAKER_40]: And I think that the question keeps coming about because of the confusion, Mr. President, that we had.

817
01:25:35,574 --> 01:25:40,076
[SPEAKER_40]: And I don't want to make this any longer than it has to be.

818
01:25:40,356 --> 01:25:45,920
[SPEAKER_40]: But if we can ask the chief of staff, really, for the clarity with what happened during the budget meeting.

819
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:49,522
[SPEAKER_40]: Just so you know, the mayor did speak, but before the mayor, Tim McGibbon

820
01:25:50,822 --> 01:26:00,267
[SPEAKER_40]: mentioned that the DPW directed mentioned that we are not looking at a specific identified sidewalk and road repair team.

821
01:26:00,687 --> 01:26:10,172
[SPEAKER_40]: What we're doing is we're spreading that that money from the override to 20% for different departments to maintain the street services.

822
01:26:10,252 --> 01:26:12,913
[SPEAKER_40]: So I think the confusion comes in if we can have a report

823
01:26:13,567 --> 01:26:17,337
[SPEAKER_40]: that the override in that question said $500,000 for street repair and sidewalk.

824
01:26:20,290 --> 01:26:27,274
[SPEAKER_40]: I think the mayor made mention of it that evening as well, that we were creating a team, we were training them, making sure they have the right equipment.

825
01:26:27,595 --> 01:26:29,916
[SPEAKER_40]: And that's what people thought we were doing.

826
01:26:29,936 --> 01:26:34,219
[SPEAKER_40]: We thought we were having a separate sidewalk and pothole crew.

827
01:26:34,619 --> 01:26:36,260
[SPEAKER_40]: So I think that's where the confusion comes in.

828
01:26:36,300 --> 01:26:45,846
[SPEAKER_40]: So if my colleague is offended, I think that might clarify some issues if we can have a report maybe at our next meeting in a few weeks, just to understand where that is.

829
01:26:45,866 --> 01:26:47,767
[SPEAKER_40]: Because that's why it keeps coming back up.

830
01:26:47,827 --> 01:26:49,068
[SPEAKER_40]: I think people are confused that

831
01:26:49,548 --> 01:26:50,588
[SPEAKER_40]: you know, myself included.

832
01:26:50,668 --> 01:26:51,209
[SPEAKER_40]: So thank you.

833
01:26:51,769 --> 01:26:52,169
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

834
01:26:52,209 --> 01:27:02,572
[SPEAKER_35]: And I just want to note, and I'll go to the chief of staff, but I don't, but what Commissioner McGivern said was there was a 20% increase in the budget staffing for the highway department.

835
01:27:03,092 --> 01:27:09,874
[SPEAKER_35]: And then the appropriation that we approved in November, it was specifically to hire the highway crew.

836
01:27:10,755 --> 01:27:11,795
[SPEAKER_35]: And what he said was,

837
01:27:12,375 --> 01:27:26,449
[SPEAKER_35]: that because of this increase we will be able to have a crew using the new equipment that has been purchased as well out four days a week instead of two days per week so we would not be outsourcing sidewalk.

838
01:27:26,509 --> 01:27:31,274
[SPEAKER_35]: That is what he said and I've talked to him about it about six times but I'll let the Chief of Staff continue on that.

839
01:27:34,646 --> 01:27:37,187
[SPEAKER_14]: I do think there has been some confusion on this matter.

840
01:27:37,727 --> 01:27:54,354
[SPEAKER_14]: I specifically recall the 20% that the DPW commissioner mentioned to refer to a 20% increase in production, essentially putting a new crew out on the street, three individuals, and that is what we are doing.

841
01:27:54,894 --> 01:27:56,255
[SPEAKER_14]: So I wanna be very clear about that.

842
01:28:03,352 --> 01:28:13,880
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'd further clarify to just say, and I can distribute this information if it's helpful, at some point when we came before this council to have

843
01:28:14,984 --> 01:28:23,008
[SPEAKER_14]: further appropriations in FY25 approved by this council, that $500,000 was broken out into very distinct categories.

844
01:28:23,568 --> 01:28:30,892
[SPEAKER_14]: If the council will recall, it discussed personnel, and that was for three members to be hired.

845
01:28:31,092 --> 01:28:37,115
[SPEAKER_14]: So the DPW crew, specifically the highway department crew, expanded by three full-time equivalents.

846
01:28:37,775 --> 01:28:40,877
[SPEAKER_14]: In other words, three 40-hour-a-week employees.

847
01:28:41,637 --> 01:28:43,778
[SPEAKER_14]: and it also included health insurance.

848
01:28:43,858 --> 01:28:55,600
[SPEAKER_14]: It also included capital because, you know, there is the obvious that when we hire a new crew, we're going to need new vehicles to go along with that crew to make it fully functional.

849
01:28:56,121 --> 01:29:00,722
[SPEAKER_14]: So again, if that information is needed, I'm happy to distribute it again to the council.

850
01:29:00,822 --> 01:29:02,502
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sure it's in the council's packet.

851
01:29:02,622 --> 01:29:05,783
[SPEAKER_14]: If someone wants to look back, I just, I think it was in the fall, October, November.

852
01:29:07,130 --> 01:29:31,058
[SPEAKER_40]: like I thank you just very simple just for the next meeting if we could just get a breakdown with I know the spreader with the spreader was was purchased that we were training we're hiring three new people they were that's what the that's what the impression that a lot of people had so if we could just get a breakdown that we have that crew in the next meeting when that crew will start when they'll be trained and have we use that spreader to make to do that thank you

853
01:29:32,963 --> 01:29:33,443
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

854
01:29:33,463 --> 01:29:37,287
[SPEAKER_35]: Is there anyone else who would like to speak in public participation who hasn't yet spoken?

855
01:29:39,889 --> 01:29:41,710
[SPEAKER_35]: Seeing none, I will go to Mr. Merritt.

856
01:29:41,730 --> 01:29:42,431
[SPEAKER_35]: You have another minute.

857
01:29:43,252 --> 01:29:44,593
[SPEAKER_35]: Name and address for the record, please.

858
01:29:44,713 --> 01:29:46,234
[SPEAKER_31]: Nate Merritt, 373 Riverside Ave.

859
01:29:46,274 --> 01:29:48,036
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm sorry I didn't accept the civics lesson.

860
01:29:48,676 --> 01:29:55,983
[SPEAKER_31]: So I find your comments very condescending, and I'm just trying to understand because at face value, and I'm sure I'm not alone,

861
01:29:57,453 --> 01:30:12,048
[SPEAKER_31]: The fact that there's a listing of $200 million in this paper for street and sidewalk backlog, yet a transfer of $267,000 from another paper, where if you take both them together you go, why am I shifting money from one budget if there's nothing to work on?

862
01:30:12,388 --> 01:30:17,353
[SPEAKER_31]: But at the other side of the cheek, you say, well we have all this stuff to get work done.

863
01:30:18,265 --> 01:30:19,505
[SPEAKER_31]: So that was my question.

864
01:30:19,546 --> 01:30:21,126
[SPEAKER_31]: It wasn't specific to the override.

865
01:30:21,226 --> 01:30:24,527
[SPEAKER_31]: It just happens to also coincide with half the cost of the override.

866
01:30:24,868 --> 01:30:30,430
[SPEAKER_31]: But it's really because the fact that in a line item here in this paper is $200 million for street and sidewalk backlog.

867
01:30:30,930 --> 01:30:32,430
[SPEAKER_31]: So that's why it was related to this one.

868
01:30:32,891 --> 01:30:33,231
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

869
01:30:34,671 --> 01:30:35,231
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

870
01:30:36,532 --> 01:30:38,233
[SPEAKER_35]: Any further discussion on the motion?

871
01:30:40,373 --> 01:30:41,514
[SPEAKER_35]: There's a motion to approve.

872
01:30:47,726 --> 01:30:48,926
[SPEAKER_35]: Any further discussion on the motion?

873
01:30:48,946 --> 01:30:53,487
[SPEAKER_35]: Seeing none, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

[SPEAKER_35]: Sincerely, Brandon O'Kern, Mayor.

910
01:32:33,152 --> 01:32:39,100
[SPEAKER_35]: Madam Chief of Staff, I'll recognize you and I also know we have Finance Director Dickinson as well.

911
01:32:39,601 --> 01:32:42,244
[SPEAKER_35]: So if you'd like him to speak, let me know and I will ask him to unmute.

912
01:32:43,384 --> 01:32:44,545
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much, President Bears.

913
01:32:45,345 --> 01:32:52,590
[SPEAKER_14]: As the council knows, every year it's customary in cities and towns for there to be transfers for the fiscal year end.

914
01:32:53,310 --> 01:33:02,356
[SPEAKER_14]: It's when one budget requires more funding than another budget was anticipated to require, and it's a common practice.

915
01:33:02,917 --> 01:33:10,802
[SPEAKER_14]: It's one that I've seen in every community I've worked in, and I'm happy to answer any questions on any specific lines that the council would like information on.

916
01:33:11,102 --> 01:33:23,251
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you just to the point could you explain how there was a $500,000 allocation for the fiscal year for DPW, but then because of the union contract positions had to be made available within the union.

917
01:33:24,207 --> 01:33:26,269
[SPEAKER_35]: So all of that had to happen.

918
01:33:26,309 --> 01:33:32,474
[SPEAKER_35]: And then the positions, the three new positions have been advertised, but for most of this year, they were empty.

919
01:33:32,494 --> 01:33:37,459
[SPEAKER_35]: Is that the explanation for why funds are being transferred from that budget?

920
01:33:37,519 --> 01:33:40,862
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think there are two distinct issues.

921
01:33:40,922 --> 01:33:46,787
[SPEAKER_14]: I think you're absolutely correct, President Bears, that because of the override funding,

922
01:33:48,709 --> 01:34:06,101
[SPEAKER_14]: and because of the union contract, in order for the city to actually hire these positions that it set out and outlined in the document I described earlier, we are required to internally post those positions amongst DPW employees.

923
01:34:06,161 --> 01:34:08,522
[SPEAKER_14]: They have the first dibs at those positions.

924
01:34:08,622 --> 01:34:16,788
[SPEAKER_14]: So if somebody is in a, let's say, a lower ranking position and wants to seek a promotion, can actually apply and has a first cut at that.

925
01:34:17,168 --> 01:34:24,690
[SPEAKER_14]: before the position is publicly advertised, that's a requirement under the collective bargaining agreement and one we have a legal obligation to maintain.

926
01:34:25,490 --> 01:34:27,911
[SPEAKER_14]: In that process, there's typically a domino effect.

927
01:34:27,951 --> 01:34:45,915
[SPEAKER_14]: Just as if there is a vacancy in the department, the positions posted internally, because that vacancy may be a position that's greater than positions other members of the department hold, then there's almost always a domino effect, unless the position is, let's say, the lowest paid position in the department.

928
01:34:46,695 --> 01:34:49,177
[SPEAKER_14]: An internal employee applies for the position.

929
01:34:49,717 --> 01:34:59,404
[SPEAKER_14]: If they're qualified and if a variety of factors that put them into the proper place allows the city to award a position to them, we will.

930
01:35:00,024 --> 01:35:04,047
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's exactly what happened with these three positions for the override.

931
01:35:04,607 --> 01:35:08,948
[SPEAKER_14]: the positions were posted, the internal candidates applied.

932
01:35:09,128 --> 01:35:11,749
[SPEAKER_14]: Usually there's a lot of internal applicants, which is excellent.

933
01:35:12,889 --> 01:35:30,535
[SPEAKER_14]: Internal applicants applied, we then hired from within, which then meant that there was vacancies in the positions in which those individuals left, which also can have further domino effects on the department because then those individuals may be taking positions where there are individuals who are lower than them.

934
01:35:30,555 --> 01:35:31,915
[SPEAKER_14]: I think you all get the picture.

935
01:35:32,616 --> 01:35:40,311
[SPEAKER_14]: But I don't believe that that really is directly related to the funding here as it relates to the DPW expenses.

936
01:35:42,215 --> 01:35:43,277
[SPEAKER_14]: Largely, I think the

937
01:35:45,860 --> 01:35:55,463
[SPEAKER_14]: Sometimes the easiest way to say this is that some of our larger departments tend to be the departments that sometimes might have additional funding left over in them.

938
01:35:55,563 --> 01:36:05,526
[SPEAKER_14]: For instance, where we have this scenario where we are hiring from within and then there's vacancies, that vacancy is what I like to call a float.

939
01:36:06,046 --> 01:36:09,928
[SPEAKER_14]: A float is essentially available dollars in the budget because

940
01:36:10,948 --> 01:36:15,851
[SPEAKER_14]: we didn't have the position filled or it was taking time to go through a filling procedure.

941
01:36:16,211 --> 01:36:17,652
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if that directly answers the question.

942
01:36:17,692 --> 01:36:22,816
[SPEAKER_14]: It was a little hard to hear the question from my angle, but I'm happy to get any clarification.

943
01:36:22,956 --> 01:36:23,416
[SPEAKER_35]: That's fine.

944
01:36:23,456 --> 01:36:27,258
[SPEAKER_35]: I just wanted to go through the process of filling those positions.

945
01:36:28,019 --> 01:36:30,701
[SPEAKER_35]: Do we have questions from the Council on the transfers?

946
01:36:30,741 --> 01:36:31,701
[SPEAKER_35]: Councilor Scarpelli.

947
01:36:32,762 --> 01:36:35,524
[SPEAKER_40]: I think that this goes hands in hands with the Chief of Staff.

948
01:36:35,584 --> 01:36:39,146
[SPEAKER_40]: I think that one question that I had related to free cash, but

949
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:47,804
[SPEAKER_40]: Then with the transfer, I know that last year we used excess funds from 2025 budget.

950
01:36:49,005 --> 01:36:51,286
[SPEAKER_40]: We replenished free cash, I believe it was $9 million.

951
01:36:51,506 --> 01:36:58,090
[SPEAKER_40]: Are we using any monies to replenish to go back into free cash this time around?

952
01:36:59,428 --> 01:37:01,689
[SPEAKER_14]: President Bears through you to Councilor Scarpelli.

953
01:37:01,749 --> 01:37:06,711
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, that's a question I can't fully answer at this time, but undoubtedly the answer is going to be yes.

954
01:37:06,771 --> 01:37:09,012
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not that we're attempting to replenish anything.

955
01:37:09,733 --> 01:37:23,039
[SPEAKER_14]: It's because best practices and municipal government are such that we are required, as you know, to present a balanced budget to this council, which in order to maintain a balanced budget throughout the year,

956
01:37:23,839 --> 01:37:33,602
[SPEAKER_14]: best practices in municipal budgeting require that we actually budgeted conservatively so we, you know, our, our finance director who's on the line who is welcome to chime in on any of this.

957
01:37:34,123 --> 01:37:40,045
[SPEAKER_14]: He's responsible to go through a process to do estimates on a number of different things and by the way that it works.

958
01:37:41,626 --> 01:37:45,267
[SPEAKER_14]: The ability to look back is actually basically two years back.

959
01:37:45,388 --> 01:37:52,031
[SPEAKER_14]: So when we're building the FY 26 budget as an example, we're actually looking back to 24 actuals.

960
01:37:52,371 --> 01:37:55,613
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't have 25 actuals yet because 25 hasn't closed.

961
01:37:55,933 --> 01:38:04,558
[SPEAKER_14]: And so to get back to your specific question, Councilor Scarapelli, we don't, in fact, know exactly where FY 25 is going to close at and what those numbers will look like.

962
01:38:04,918 --> 01:38:10,383
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll know that better once we get closer to the middle of the summer and we're starting to close the books.

963
01:38:10,443 --> 01:38:13,406
[SPEAKER_14]: But again, I defer to our finance director if he has further commentary.

964
01:38:13,466 --> 01:38:15,147
[SPEAKER_40]: And just a follow-up with that.

965
01:38:15,187 --> 01:38:24,356
[SPEAKER_40]: I know my colleagues like to say that using free cash for operating costs is a no-go, and we understand that.

966
01:38:25,632 --> 01:38:30,417
[SPEAKER_40]: It's true that free cash comes from unfilled positions as well, correct?

967
01:38:30,898 --> 01:38:33,621
[SPEAKER_40]: That comes from operation costs as well.

968
01:38:33,661 --> 01:38:44,973
[SPEAKER_40]: So I think that's where another time that people get really confused when some councils start banging their head and start saying that you can't use operating costs to pay free cash to pay operating costs.

969
01:38:45,293 --> 01:38:46,895
[SPEAKER_40]: But for that one time at the time,

970
01:38:47,596 --> 01:39:15,508
[SPEAKER_40]: the objective was since we're putting free cash from unfunded salaries or unfilled positions that that was that's being used I think that was that's a clarifying point not nothing to answer but that's just a clarifying point that as we see now and you're looking at different salary pieces being being shifted um you could see when that happens and I appreciate the answer that we won't know the 25 until some time but at least we know that that we because I know that people get nervous even at

971
01:39:16,258 --> 01:39:18,341
[SPEAKER_40]: $12 million, you know where I stand with that.

972
01:39:18,681 --> 01:39:22,546
[SPEAKER_40]: I think that's plenty, especially with those two factors, which is the bond rating.

973
01:39:23,367 --> 01:39:31,356
[SPEAKER_40]: But I also want to make sure that if there is some more free cash coming to fill that need, that we can be able to spend it on capital needs as well.

974
01:39:31,376 --> 01:39:31,777
[SPEAKER_40]: So thank you.

975
01:39:32,190 --> 01:39:46,435
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure, thank you, and I'm not sure you're looking for this comment, but I'll, President Bears, through you, if I may, you know, it's not just, I think, the members of the council who say that, it's myself as well.

976
01:39:46,595 --> 01:39:57,038
[SPEAKER_14]: As an individual who's been trained municipally, who's been working in this field for the last, I don't know, close to 18 years now, I can tell you that that's also a best practice.

977
01:39:57,639 --> 01:40:01,040
[SPEAKER_14]: Bond rating agencies do not like to see municipalities use

978
01:40:02,060 --> 01:40:03,881
[SPEAKER_14]: one-time funds to fund operating costs.

979
01:40:03,941 --> 01:40:05,181
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just a matter of fact.

980
01:40:05,221 --> 01:40:09,802
[SPEAKER_14]: And I just say that because it's just something that's come up over and over again.

981
01:40:09,822 --> 01:40:17,624
[SPEAKER_14]: And frankly, Medford was, I don't, yeah, I won't go into the long history, but we are out of that place and we don't want to get back to that place.

982
01:40:18,124 --> 01:40:18,404
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

983
01:40:19,745 --> 01:40:20,165
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

984
01:40:20,825 --> 01:40:24,866
[SPEAKER_35]: Any further comments or questions by members of the council on this paper?

985
01:40:26,967 --> 01:40:27,727
[SPEAKER_35]: Vice President Collins.

986
01:40:29,742 --> 01:40:32,243
[SPEAKER_24]: I have no further questions or comments at this time.

987
01:40:32,343 --> 01:40:36,824
[SPEAKER_24]: Pending further concerns from my Councilors and public comment, I would motion for approval.

988
01:40:36,844 --> 01:40:40,885
[SPEAKER_35]: I have a motion to approve by Vice President Collins, seconded by.

989
01:40:42,065 --> 01:40:43,266
[SPEAKER_35]: Seconded by Councilor Leming.

990
01:40:44,586 --> 01:40:49,067
[SPEAKER_35]: Seeing no further discussion by members of the Council, are there any members of the public who would like to comment on this paper?

991
01:40:49,687 --> 01:40:52,488
[SPEAKER_35]: Please come to the podium or raise your hand on Zoom.

992
01:40:57,937 --> 01:40:58,357
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

993
01:40:58,997 --> 01:41:00,478
[SPEAKER_35]: Name and address for the record, please.

994
01:41:00,558 --> 01:41:02,019
[SPEAKER_35]: And you'll have three minutes.

995
01:41:02,619 --> 01:41:03,079
[SPEAKER_28]: Hi, thanks.

996
01:41:03,139 --> 01:41:04,920
[SPEAKER_28]: Sam Goldstein, 29 Martin Street.

997
01:41:05,921 --> 01:41:12,984
[SPEAKER_28]: Just as we're talking about pre-cash, there's a pretty major housing crisis going on.

998
01:41:13,024 --> 01:41:17,506
[SPEAKER_28]: I think it's driving a lot of what the council's been doing this year and in past years.

999
01:41:18,266 --> 01:41:24,689
[SPEAKER_28]: And I would even say it's really animating a lot of municipal politics all across the country, if you look at New York City.

1000
01:41:27,777 --> 01:41:45,067
[SPEAKER_28]: I, you know, I just wanted to get up and say that I, you know, I would like to see the city take a little more, you know, active approach and addressing that, and particularly things like funding, you know, exploring funding the affordable housing trust fund and using

1001
01:41:46,319 --> 01:41:49,401
[SPEAKER_28]: you know, these reserves to jumpstart this process.

1002
01:41:49,521 --> 01:41:55,025
[SPEAKER_28]: I think that, you know, there's an opportunity here to take a more active approach on that.

1003
01:41:55,085 --> 01:42:00,829
[SPEAKER_28]: And it's something I wanted to speak on and, you know, ask at least in the future for the city to consider.

1004
01:42:00,849 --> 01:42:01,269
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

1005
01:42:01,950 --> 01:42:02,330
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

1006
01:42:04,792 --> 01:42:07,654
[SPEAKER_35]: Any further public comment on this item?

1007
01:42:10,336 --> 01:42:11,617
[SPEAKER_35]: Seeing none, on the motion.

1008
01:42:12,037 --> 01:42:12,998
[SPEAKER_35]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1009
01:42:18,194 --> 01:42:19,234
[SPEAKER_41]: Councilor Callahan is absent.

1010
01:42:19,595 --> 01:42:20,355
[SPEAKER_41]: Vice President Collins?

1011
01:42:20,375 --> 01:42:20,455
[SPEAKER_41]: Yes.

1012
01:42:21,615 --> 01:42:22,476
[SPEAKER_41]: Councilor Lazzaro?

1013
01:42:25,037 --> 01:42:25,337
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

1014
01:42:27,017 --> 01:42:27,537
[SPEAKER_41]: Councilor Leming?

1015
01:42:27,557 --> 01:42:28,658
[SPEAKER_41]: Yes.

1016
01:42:28,678 --> 01:42:29,218
[SPEAKER_41]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1017
01:42:29,238 --> 01:42:29,358
[SPEAKER_41]: No.

1018
01:42:31,539 --> 01:42:32,079
[SPEAKER_41]: Councilor Tseng?

1019
01:42:33,160 --> 01:42:33,480
Yes.

1020
01:42:34,980 --> 01:42:35,580
[SPEAKER_41]: President Bears?

1021
01:42:35,941 --> 01:42:36,201
[SPEAKER_35]: Yes.

1022
01:42:36,221 --> 01:42:38,322
[SPEAKER_35]: Five in the affirmative, one in the negative, one absent.

1023
01:42:38,342 --> 01:42:39,302
[SPEAKER_35]: The motion passes.

1024
01:42:41,105 --> 01:42:48,008
[SPEAKER_35]: 25108 submitted by Mayor Breanna Lungo-Koehn, establishing transfer funds to Medford Public Schools Special Purpose Override Stabilization Fund.

1025
01:42:48,488 --> 01:42:50,509
[SPEAKER_35]: We've discussed this at several meetings.

1026
01:42:51,469 --> 01:42:58,412
[SPEAKER_35]: On November 5, Question 8 was approved for fiscal 25 Medford Public Schools in the amount of $4 million.

1027
01:42:59,432 --> 01:43:03,814
[SPEAKER_35]: Based on the outcome of negotiations with union partners, when negotiated payments will be due,

1028
01:43:04,454 --> 01:43:07,076
[SPEAKER_35]: The schools anticipate having a balance at the end of fiscal 25.

1029
01:43:07,136 --> 01:43:17,242
[SPEAKER_35]: We are requesting to segregate that balance in a special account to ensure the full amount of the override for fiscal 25 is available to MPS for contractual requirements in future years.

1030
01:43:17,783 --> 01:43:20,745
[SPEAKER_35]: The special account will be used solely for school purposes as outlined in question 8.

1031
01:43:21,545 --> 01:43:29,692
[SPEAKER_35]: In particular, Chapter 40, Section 5B of the General Law stipulates that cities and towns and districts may create one or more stabilization funds and appropriate any amount to the funds.

1032
01:43:30,212 --> 01:43:36,457
[SPEAKER_35]: Creation of a special purpose stabilization fund requires a two-thirds vote, and appropriation of monies into and out of the fund requires a majority vote.

1033
01:43:36,897 --> 01:43:43,863
[SPEAKER_35]: By taking this action, we will have a source of funding available to supplement the Medford Public Schools annual operating budget in the upcoming fiscal year and future fiscal years.

1034
01:43:43,943 --> 01:43:47,366
[SPEAKER_35]: We did receive a presentation from Noelle

1035
01:43:47,900 --> 01:43:59,649
[SPEAKER_35]: and Jerry from the finance department as well as the interim superintendent Suzanne Galusi at a previous meeting talking about the plan to use these funds over the next 3 years for the contractual obligations of the Medford public schools.

1036
01:44:00,470 --> 01:44:03,012
[SPEAKER_35]: I know the chief of staff was just working on making sure we got the

1037
01:44:03,552 --> 01:44:07,956
[SPEAKER_35]: legal language correct, and that's why it's on the agenda tonight instead of at our last meeting.

1038
01:44:09,037 --> 01:44:21,489
[SPEAKER_35]: So, you know, we've had quite a bit of discussion on this, but I am happy to hear from the chief of staff or our school department team who is here on Zoom before we move forward.

1039
01:44:21,509 --> 01:44:23,471
[SPEAKER_35]: Do you have any comments, Madam Chief of Staff?

1040
01:44:24,540 --> 01:44:25,261
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, President Bears.

1041
01:44:25,301 --> 01:44:26,341
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't have much to add.

1042
01:44:26,461 --> 01:44:34,227
[SPEAKER_14]: As you, as the council probably knows and has seen, we try to really incorporate as much into the papers as possible so the council has the information up front.

1043
01:44:34,287 --> 01:44:37,309
[SPEAKER_14]: So I certainly defer to the team who knows the details best.

1044
01:44:38,089 --> 01:44:38,349
[SPEAKER_35]: Great.

1045
01:44:38,469 --> 01:44:46,815
[SPEAKER_35]: And just to confirm, this is creating the special purpose override stabilization fund and transferring the sum of $2,185,000 from the balance remaining in the fiscal 25 Medford Public Schools budget.

1046
01:44:52,965 --> 01:44:57,249
[SPEAKER_35]: If the school team, I'm going to recognize our school department CFO.

1047
01:45:00,832 --> 01:45:01,393
[SPEAKER_35]: Noelle, go ahead.

1048
01:45:02,872 --> 01:45:03,593
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.

1049
01:45:03,653 --> 01:45:04,354
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, everyone.

1050
01:45:05,174 --> 01:45:10,319
[SPEAKER_00]: Noah, as we brought up earlier, you know, we had our presentation brought in approximately about a month ago.

1051
01:45:11,180 --> 01:45:16,464
[SPEAKER_00]: Just understanding that these funds are specifically for certain unions we're negotiating with.

1052
01:45:16,605 --> 01:45:22,510
[SPEAKER_00]: We're glad to say we're almost landing our plane with the para union, which is one of the other unions.

1053
01:45:23,210 --> 01:45:29,234
[SPEAKER_00]: that the stabilization funds would be used regarding their new schedules that we're implementing over at all the schools.

1054
01:45:29,794 --> 01:45:41,582
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, any other stipends that may be involved with this and their pay raises coming in with this new contract that they're hopefully reviewing at the moment.

1055
01:45:45,064 --> 01:45:45,284
[SPEAKER_35]: Great.

1056
01:45:45,624 --> 01:45:48,686
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you, Director Velez.

1057
01:45:48,826 --> 01:45:50,888
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm going to go to Vice President Collins.

1058
01:45:52,209 --> 01:45:53,070
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, President Bears.

1059
01:45:53,130 --> 01:45:56,171
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you to the MPS team and Chief of Staff again for presenting.

1060
01:45:56,191 --> 01:46:06,758
[SPEAKER_24]: So just to put this in really simple language, the purpose of this establishment and transfer is to make sure that the funds raised through Question 8 remain protected for use by Bedford Public Schools.

1061
01:46:06,858 --> 01:46:07,919
[SPEAKER_24]: I believe I have that correct.

1062
01:46:08,779 --> 01:46:09,840
[SPEAKER_24]: I would motion to approve.

1063
01:46:11,901 --> 01:46:14,262
[SPEAKER_35]: I'll motion Vice President Collins to approve, seconded by.

1064
01:46:16,084 --> 01:46:16,944
[SPEAKER_35]: Seconded by Councilor Leming.

1065
01:46:16,984 --> 01:46:18,365
[SPEAKER_35]: Any further discussion by members of the Council?

1066
01:46:22,010 --> 01:46:26,591
[SPEAKER_35]: Seeing none, is there anyone from the public who'd like to comment on this item, either in person or on Zoom?

1067
01:46:27,011 --> 01:46:29,732
[SPEAKER_35]: You can come to the podium in person or raise your hand on Zoom.

1068
01:46:40,074 --> 01:46:40,714
[SPEAKER_35]: That's a good point.

1069
01:46:40,774 --> 01:46:42,054
[SPEAKER_35]: We need to take two votes on this.

1070
01:46:42,534 --> 01:46:46,835
[SPEAKER_35]: One to approve and establish the fund, and then one to make the transfer.

1071
01:46:46,915 --> 01:46:47,575
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you, Mr. Clerk.

1072
01:46:49,165 --> 01:46:54,968
[SPEAKER_35]: So we have a motion to establish the fund from vice-president Collins, seconded by councilor Leming.

1073
01:46:56,308 --> 01:46:58,509
[SPEAKER_35]: Seeing no public comment, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1074
01:47:03,472 --> 01:47:04,492

[SPEAKER_41]: Councilor Tseng.

1081
01:47:16,398 --> 01:47:16,598
Yes.

1082
01:47:18,641 --> 01:47:22,846
[SPEAKER_35]: Yes, finding the affirmative, one of the negative, one absent, the motion passes and the fund is established.

1083
01:47:23,466 --> 01:47:31,435
[SPEAKER_35]: Do we have a motion to transfer the balance of $2,185,000 from the fiscal 25 Medford Public Schools budget to the fund?

1084
01:47:31,756 --> 01:47:35,740
[SPEAKER_35]: On the motion of Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Leming.

1085

1099
01:48:04,617 --> 01:48:05,458
[SPEAKER_35]: The motion passes.

1100
01:48:06,244 --> 01:48:15,151
[SPEAKER_35]: Reverting to the regular order of business, 25-103 offered by Vice President Collins, proposed amendments to the Menford Zoning Ordinance, other quarters, districts, for referral to the Community Development Board.

1101
01:48:15,191 --> 01:48:16,192
[SPEAKER_35]: Vice President Collins.

1102
01:48:16,432 --> 01:48:19,054
[SPEAKER_24]: President Bears, I motion to table to our next regular meeting.

1103
01:48:19,474 --> 01:48:25,519
[SPEAKER_35]: On the motion to table to our next regular meeting on July 15th by Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Leming.

1104
01:48:26,099 --> 01:48:27,080
[SPEAKER_35]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1105
01:48:43,338 --> 01:48:43,879
[SPEAKER_41]: Councilor Calderon.

1106
01:48:43,939 --> 01:48:46,060
[SPEAKER_35]: It's not referred to table to table to July 15th.

1107
01:48:52,544 --> 01:48:53,605
[SPEAKER_41]: Council County is absent.

1108
01:48:53,625 --> 01:48:54,606
[SPEAKER_41]: Vice President Collins.

1109
01:48:55,826 --> 01:48:56,647
[SPEAKER_41]: Councilor Lazzaro.

1110
01:48:57,107 --> 01:48:57,367
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

1111
01:48:57,387 --> 01:48:59,329
[SPEAKER_41]: That's a lemon.

1112
01:48:59,809 --> 01:49:01,010
[SPEAKER_41]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1113
01:49:01,950 --> 01:49:03,511
[SPEAKER_41]: Councilor Tseng Yes.

1114
01:49:12,414 --> 01:49:14,615
[SPEAKER_35]: to Vice President Collins for the next two resolutions.

1115
01:49:21,257 --> 01:49:28,860
It's all right here.

1116
01:50:04,088 --> 01:50:10,900
[SPEAKER_24]: 24-104-25-104 offered by President Bears's resolution in opposition to Scarametti versus United States Supreme Court decision.

1117
01:50:12,405 --> 01:50:33,338
[SPEAKER_24]: Whereas the recent scrutiny versus United States majority opinion by the United States Supreme Court enables and protects unjust laws that discriminate against transgender people in the United States, and whereas the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution obviously prevents federal, state, and local governments from passing laws or taking actions that violate the Equal Protection Clause,

1118
01:50:34,018 --> 01:50:40,726
[SPEAKER_24]: Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Medford City Council that we strongly oppose the Scrimidi versus United States decision.

1119
01:50:41,387 --> 01:50:49,596
[SPEAKER_24]: Be it further resolved that we call on our state government to pass the strongest possible protections for transgender people and protect their inalienable right to medical care.

1120
01:50:50,016 --> 01:50:50,477
[SPEAKER_24]: President Bears.

1121
01:50:55,217 --> 01:50:56,519
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you, Madam President.

1122
01:50:57,460 --> 01:50:59,363
[SPEAKER_35]: I think the resolution really speaks for itself.

1123
01:50:59,483 --> 01:51:11,920
[SPEAKER_35]: We've seen yet another horrific decision from the United States Supreme Court to strip rights away from our neighbors and our friends and allow

1124
01:51:12,972 --> 01:51:27,819
[SPEAKER_35]: right-wing extremists to define the scope of what it means to get health care, regardless of what the medical establishment and doctors and nurses, nevermind what an individual person and their doctor determine is best for them.

1125
01:51:27,839 --> 01:51:30,760
[SPEAKER_35]: I think this is a disgraceful statement.

1126
01:51:30,840 --> 01:51:41,225
[SPEAKER_35]: I know there are a lot of people in this community who are afraid when we see these actions and decisions and laws being implemented.

1127
01:51:42,543 --> 01:52:04,450
[SPEAKER_35]: And I am grateful both for our local gender affirming care ordinance protections as well as our state law protections that Massachusetts is not a state that is going down this path, but with this Supreme Court, and with all of the states and all of the people in those states who are so horribly impacted.

1128
01:52:06,412 --> 01:52:26,143
[SPEAKER_35]: believe it's essential that we stand in solidarity with them and in just basic statement about the fact that an equal protection clause in our 14th Amendment means equal protection for everyone, regardless of what this court majority seems to think.

1129
01:52:26,984 --> 01:52:30,666
[SPEAKER_35]: That's why I put forward this resolution and why I asked for my colleagues' support.

1130
01:52:30,786 --> 01:52:31,406
[SPEAKER_35]: I move approval.

1131
01:52:32,967 --> 01:52:33,687
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, President Bears.

1132
01:52:35,049 --> 01:52:36,771
[SPEAKER_24]: I will go to Councilor Lazzaro on Zoom.

1133
01:52:39,053 --> 01:52:39,533
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

1134
01:52:40,314 --> 01:52:46,839
[SPEAKER_25]: I'd be happy to second President Bears's motion and I appreciate him bringing this forward.

1135
01:52:47,540 --> 01:52:56,068
[SPEAKER_25]: When Councilor Tseng and I were working on the gender affirming care portion of the reproductive health care and gender affirming care ordinance,

1136
01:52:57,789 --> 01:53:12,549
[SPEAKER_25]: We were told that we shouldn't do it because it could make us a target of the Trump administration, it goes against the executive order about diversity, equity, and inclusion, and avoiding

1137
01:53:15,612 --> 01:53:19,814
[SPEAKER_25]: Things that might make Medford come under fire.

1138
01:53:19,834 --> 01:53:30,098
[SPEAKER_25]: We were also told that nobody had ever come to the DEI office asking for these sort of protections before.

1139
01:53:32,897 --> 01:53:48,547
[SPEAKER_25]: Off the top of my head, I can think of six people who live in Medford that I know personally who are trans and just because they haven't come to City Hall to directly ask for protections doesn't mean

1140
01:53:49,508 --> 01:54:17,405
[SPEAKER_25]: that we shouldn't offer them doesn't mean that they might not appreciate a show of solidarity and a resolution like this saying that we as your local government do not support and do not stand for this kind of measure as part of your government I think is meaningful for people and I think we need to continue to make these statements during this

1141
01:54:18,412 --> 01:54:19,592
[SPEAKER_25]: time in America.

1142
01:54:19,672 --> 01:54:24,373
[SPEAKER_25]: I think it's one of the few things that keeps Medford residents feeling safe.

1143
01:54:24,453 --> 01:54:32,395
[SPEAKER_25]: And that's one of our duties is to do what we can to keep our Medford residents feeling a little bit safer.

1144
01:54:32,595 --> 01:54:36,956
[SPEAKER_25]: So I'm happy to support this resolution.

1145
01:54:36,976 --> 01:54:40,936
[SPEAKER_25]: I think that anything that we can do in the face of

1146
01:54:44,237 --> 01:54:54,683
[SPEAKER_25]: a justice and unreasonable decisions being made by our government, we should do it.

1147
01:54:55,024 --> 01:54:58,025
[SPEAKER_25]: So I appreciate President Bears bringing this forward.

1148
01:54:58,065 --> 01:54:58,666
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you very much.

1149
01:54:59,967 --> 01:55:00,887
[SPEAKER_25]: I second the motion.

1150
01:55:01,508 --> 01:55:01,848
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

1151
01:55:03,789 --> 01:55:04,930
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Councilor Lazzaro.

1152
01:55:04,950 --> 01:55:07,071
[SPEAKER_24]: We'll go to Councilor Tseng and then Councilor Scarpelli.

1153
01:55:10,262 --> 01:55:10,642
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you.

1154
01:55:11,503 --> 01:55:18,949
[SPEAKER_30]: I think councillors are at present very well, so I don't want to be too repetitive.

1155
01:55:18,989 --> 01:55:38,003
[SPEAKER_30]: But I think this underscores how serious of a moment it is in our country and the turning point we've arrived at in terms of protecting basic rights of dignity and free expression and one's ability to live as oneself and identify.

1156
01:55:39,784 --> 01:55:41,645
[SPEAKER_30]: and to just be happy in life.

1157
01:55:42,645 --> 01:55:56,850
[SPEAKER_30]: And, you know, I encourage those of you to read the actual opinion and the dissent, and especially the dissent that came out from the Supreme Court decision, because I think you'll find, I think, most of

1158
01:55:57,750 --> 01:56:09,957
[SPEAKER_30]: most reasonable minds will find that the majority opinion in this decision was yet another classic example of Chief Justice John Roberts gaslighting us into thinking that

1159
01:56:11,255 --> 01:56:24,986
[SPEAKER_30]: This law is not what it is, even though the law itself says very point blank that this is about sex, and sex is a protected class in our country, which should be a protected class in our country.

1160
01:56:25,506 --> 01:56:39,838
[SPEAKER_30]: I think the dissent does a very good job at pointing out the mental gymnastics that the majority uses to deprive so many residents and so many citizens of our country of basic equal protection rights.

1161
01:56:45,117 --> 01:56:46,058
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Councilor.

1162
01:56:46,098 --> 01:56:47,238
[SPEAKER_24]: We'll go to Councilor Scarpelli.

1163
01:56:47,739 --> 01:56:49,160
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

1164
01:56:49,920 --> 01:56:51,621
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you, Council President, for bringing this forward.

1165
01:56:51,661 --> 01:57:08,672
[SPEAKER_40]: I think that anytime we talk about our residents that feel that there's fear and unjust and any feeling of not being supported, I think it's important, especially when we talk about our transgender community.

1166
01:57:09,753 --> 01:57:14,216
[SPEAKER_40]: I've had many conversations with my transgender friends and understanding the fears that they

1167
01:57:14,981 --> 01:57:28,494
[SPEAKER_40]: they fail every day and I think that bringing any resolution through that we can support as a council to make our residents feel that this council can support their initiatives and making sure that they feel safe I think is important.

1168
01:57:28,514 --> 01:57:32,758
[SPEAKER_40]: So I would concur with my colleagues and move forward in your support.

1169
01:57:32,878 --> 01:57:33,158
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you.

1170
01:57:35,978 --> 01:57:36,979
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1171
01:57:37,759 --> 01:57:41,481
[SPEAKER_24]: We have a motion to approve on the floor by President Bears, seconded by Councilor Lazzaro.

1172
01:57:41,561 --> 01:57:43,742
[SPEAKER_24]: Is there any public participation on this item?

1173
01:57:44,242 --> 01:57:48,204
[SPEAKER_24]: You may line up behind the podium or raise your hand on Zoom and we will alternate.

1174
01:57:51,206 --> 01:57:53,287
[SPEAKER_24]: We will start at the podium and then go to Zoom.

1175
01:57:54,608 --> 01:57:58,069
[SPEAKER_24]: All speakers will be asked to state their name and address for the record and all will have three minutes.

1176
01:57:58,670 --> 01:57:59,130
[SPEAKER_24]: Please go ahead.

1177
01:58:00,471 --> 01:58:01,551
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, sorry, I gotta unmute you.

1178
01:58:01,571 --> 01:58:03,152
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, sorry, Ellen.

1179
01:58:06,147 --> 01:58:06,847
[SPEAKER_24]: There we go.

1180
01:58:06,867 --> 01:58:06,967
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1181
01:58:07,467 --> 01:58:11,128
[SPEAKER_17]: Ellen Epstein, 15 Grove Street at Medford.

1182
01:58:11,429 --> 01:58:22,292
[SPEAKER_17]: And I just want to thank the council for once again, taking to heart what is happening at the national level, taking it seriously, and

1183
01:58:23,808 --> 01:58:31,933
[SPEAKER_17]: taking what power you have to stand up as a Medford community and resist.

1184
01:58:32,514 --> 01:58:36,276
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, and I hope that this passes unanimously.

1185
01:58:39,158 --> 01:58:39,458
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1186
01:58:40,499 --> 01:58:41,839
[SPEAKER_20]: Seeing no hands on Zoom, please go ahead.

1187
01:58:41,959 --> 01:58:42,720
[SPEAKER_20]: Name and address for the record.

1188
01:58:43,970 --> 01:58:45,891
[SPEAKER_20]: Jessica Nussbaum, One Hammond Place.

1189
01:58:46,372 --> 01:58:49,794
[SPEAKER_20]: I just want to thank President Bears and the council for considering this.

1190
01:58:50,654 --> 01:58:57,018
[SPEAKER_20]: As I read the scrimmage decision, which I have read, I had tears in my eyes as a queer non-binary person.

1191
01:58:58,119 --> 01:59:00,640
[SPEAKER_20]: I have been feeling increasingly unsafe in our country.

1192
01:59:02,021 --> 01:59:12,608
[SPEAKER_20]: And I feel very fortunate to live in Massachusetts and in Medford, where I see that my city government sees me, cares about me, wants me to be safe.

1193
01:59:13,128 --> 01:59:16,110
[SPEAKER_20]: and productive just like any other member of society, so thank you for that.

1194
01:59:17,831 --> 01:59:18,511
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you for your comments.

1195
01:59:20,813 --> 01:59:22,113
[SPEAKER_24]: Please go ahead, name and address for the record.

1196
01:59:22,874 --> 01:59:24,455
[SPEAKER_16]: Micah Kesselman, 499 Main Street.

1197
01:59:25,295 --> 01:59:28,037
[SPEAKER_16]: I just want to first off say thank you for bringing this resolution forward.

1198
01:59:28,057 --> 01:59:29,138
[SPEAKER_16]: I think this is a great resolution.

1199
01:59:30,378 --> 01:59:35,721
[SPEAKER_16]: I also want to point out that in the intervening time since this went up on the agenda, our

1200
01:59:37,608 --> 01:59:38,689
[SPEAKER_16]: enlightened Supreme Court.

1201
01:59:39,630 --> 01:59:45,637
[SPEAKER_16]: In a 6-3 decision, I enabled the complete circumvention of due process and deporting

1202
01:59:47,019 --> 01:59:54,567
[SPEAKER_16]: detained people illegally detained people to third countries that they may or may not have anything to do with the fact.

1203
01:59:55,328 --> 02:00:07,781
[SPEAKER_16]: So I would just add that if possible to include that disastrous calamitous Supreme Court decision in this resolution of opposition and vocal

1204
02:00:09,703 --> 02:00:22,216
[SPEAKER_16]: discussed at an increasingly lawless, untethered, and unbound by reason, compassion, or basic legalities that our federal administration is becoming.

1205
02:00:22,577 --> 02:00:22,877
[SPEAKER_24]: Thanks.

1206
02:00:24,018 --> 02:00:24,539
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you very much.

1207
02:00:26,120 --> 02:00:28,383
[SPEAKER_24]: We're going to speak before we proceed.

1208
02:00:35,976 --> 02:00:36,276
[SPEAKER_35]: Thanks.

1209
02:00:37,717 --> 02:00:38,377
[SPEAKER_35]: No, the next one.

1210
02:00:39,518 --> 02:00:39,778
[SPEAKER_35]: Sorry.

1211
02:00:39,898 --> 02:00:40,198
[SPEAKER_35]: It's fine.

1212
02:00:40,238 --> 02:00:41,639
[SPEAKER_35]: He's going to look it up and come back later.

1213
02:00:42,480 --> 02:00:42,680
[SPEAKER_24]: Great.

1214
02:00:42,820 --> 02:00:44,281
[SPEAKER_24]: We're going to see a hand raise on Zoom.

1215
02:00:44,301 --> 02:00:47,562
[SPEAKER_24]: We're going to go to Zoom, and then we'll resume at the podium.

1216
02:00:49,704 --> 02:00:50,844
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm going to ask you to unmute.

1217
02:00:50,884 --> 02:00:52,105
[SPEAKER_24]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1218
02:00:56,290 --> 02:01:07,755
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi, Penny Taylor 29 Martin Street, along with my dog and we both support this and are very grateful to the city council for taking this up and passing it unanimously.

1219
02:01:08,015 --> 02:01:08,315
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1220
02:01:08,335 --> 02:01:11,197
[SPEAKER_24]: Great.

1221
02:01:11,877 --> 02:01:12,417
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you very much.

1222
02:01:12,437 --> 02:01:14,278
[SPEAKER_24]: We'll go back to the podium name and address for the record, please.

1223
02:01:16,138 --> 02:01:18,159
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, Nick Giurleo, 40 Robinson Road.

1224
02:01:18,760 --> 02:01:22,983
[SPEAKER_37]: So it's very tempting for me to comment tonight on the substance of the case, but I won't.

1225
02:01:23,563 --> 02:01:24,864
[SPEAKER_37]: And I think there's a reason for that.

1226
02:01:24,884 --> 02:01:32,069
[SPEAKER_37]: And the reason is I personally believe that this holding of the United States Supreme Court doesn't have much to do with what this council is tasked with doing.

1227
02:01:32,629 --> 02:01:42,556
[SPEAKER_37]: So obviously SCOTUS rulings are binding on Medford, just like any municipality in the country, but this resolution really isn't about the applicability of the law as it might affect Medford and its people.

1228
02:01:42,616 --> 02:01:43,797
[SPEAKER_37]: To me, it seems more like

1229
02:01:44,452 --> 02:01:47,936
[SPEAKER_37]: a political statement, essentially, we don't like the outcome and that's fine.

1230
02:01:47,976 --> 02:01:49,257
[SPEAKER_37]: You don't have to like the outcome.

1231
02:01:49,918 --> 02:01:53,402
[SPEAKER_37]: But I'm just wondering, you know how the legal rationale right and it is pretty technical.

1232
02:01:53,442 --> 02:02:04,314
[SPEAKER_37]: It's talking about scrutiny, which is a very complicated legal concept, you know how that has anything to do and of course is about a law in the state of Tennessee, you know how that has anything to do with what the city council

1233
02:02:05,349 --> 02:02:14,623
[SPEAKER_37]: is supposed to be doing, you know, and to my knowledge, none of you are licensed attorneys and I don't see any indication this our new city solicitor contributed to this resolution in any way.

1234
02:02:15,383 --> 02:02:26,550
[SPEAKER_37]: And I just want to point out also that, you know, our city is facing a series of significant very local issues at the moment, like the zoning, as well as affordability, and really a host of other things.

1235
02:02:26,590 --> 02:02:29,512
[SPEAKER_37]: We had a talk tonight about a rat problem, right?

1236
02:02:29,692 --> 02:02:32,133
[SPEAKER_37]: These are very local Medford issues.

1237
02:02:33,434 --> 02:02:34,355
[SPEAKER_37]: And it's okay, right?

1238
02:02:34,375 --> 02:02:38,758
[SPEAKER_37]: You might think, you know, access to gender affirming healthcare is a local enough issue.

1239
02:02:38,818 --> 02:02:40,799
[SPEAKER_37]: And I probably don't disagree with that.

1240
02:02:40,919 --> 02:02:41,059
[SPEAKER_37]: But

1241
02:02:41,557 --> 02:02:51,399
[SPEAKER_37]: I think just practically speaking, if you look at just how the Massachusetts legislators composed at the moment, I don't think there's any chance it's going to pass a law banning access to gender affirming health care.

1242
02:02:51,479 --> 02:02:55,520
[SPEAKER_37]: So it doesn't seem like what we're talking about today is super consequential.

1243
02:02:55,741 --> 02:02:57,921
[SPEAKER_37]: So respectfully, I'm just going to put it out there.

1244
02:02:57,941 --> 02:02:59,601
[SPEAKER_37]: I don't think this is worth our time.

1245
02:02:59,621 --> 02:03:04,943
[SPEAKER_37]: I think there's other things we should be addressing before we worry about national political issues.

1246
02:03:05,083 --> 02:03:05,343
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

1247
02:03:09,752 --> 02:03:11,172
[SPEAKER_24]: We will go back to Zoom.

1248
02:03:11,412 --> 02:03:12,753
[SPEAKER_24]: Dennis, I'm going to ask you to unmute.

1249
02:03:12,833 --> 02:03:14,173
[SPEAKER_24]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1250
02:03:14,193 --> 02:03:14,933
[SPEAKER_24]: You will have three minutes.

1251
02:03:20,534 --> 02:03:20,754
[SPEAKER_12]: OK.

1252
02:03:20,934 --> 02:03:21,835
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi.

1253
02:03:21,955 --> 02:03:28,816
[SPEAKER_12]: Dennis Dettling-Calto for 120 North Street, Medford, Massachusetts.

1254
02:03:29,896 --> 02:03:35,278
[SPEAKER_12]: I just want to say, add my voice to that I am

1255
02:03:37,487 --> 02:03:39,290
[SPEAKER_12]: in favor of this resolution.

1256
02:03:39,410 --> 02:03:45,160
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's important at this time in our country's history to take a stand.

1257
02:03:45,600 --> 02:03:45,961
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1258
02:03:49,086 --> 02:03:49,627
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Dennis.

1259
02:03:49,747 --> 02:03:50,709
[SPEAKER_24]: We will go back to the podium.

1260
02:03:50,729 --> 02:03:51,871
[SPEAKER_24]: Name and address for the record, please.

1261
02:03:54,943 --> 02:03:58,385
[SPEAKER_11]: Jennifer Yanko, excuse me, 16 Monument Street.

1262
02:03:58,725 --> 02:04:03,747
[SPEAKER_11]: I wanna thank President Bears for bringing this forward and the council for considering it.

1263
02:04:04,708 --> 02:04:07,049
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel that this is very important.

1264
02:04:07,749 --> 02:04:10,530
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not that we have more important issues.

1265
02:04:11,431 --> 02:04:20,035
[SPEAKER_11]: Defending and protecting our residents is of primary importance and I very much support this and I'm very proud that you've brought it forward.

1266
02:04:20,415 --> 02:04:20,715
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1267
02:04:23,968 --> 02:04:24,448
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you very much.

1268
02:04:25,468 --> 02:04:27,469
[SPEAKER_24]: Seeing no hands on Zoom, you'll have one additional minute, Micah.

1269
02:04:28,749 --> 02:04:32,990
[SPEAKER_16]: So the case is DHS versus DVD, yes.

1270
02:04:33,151 --> 02:04:48,675
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'll also just really quickly add respectfully to this, counsel, that you are surely aware that regardless of the decision of the Supreme Court, many attorneys from across the nation have actually chimed in about the

1271
02:04:49,931 --> 02:04:56,655
[SPEAKER_16]: quality and legalities of this decision and are not in any way in agreement.

1272
02:04:56,715 --> 02:05:02,518
[SPEAKER_16]: And many of these attorneys are very experienced and know from firms that don't put up billboards by highways.

1273
02:05:02,958 --> 02:05:04,979
[SPEAKER_16]: So they know what they're talking about.

1274
02:05:05,419 --> 02:05:12,243
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think that it's okay to make statements about policy that will eventually

1275
02:05:12,983 --> 02:05:19,245
[SPEAKER_16]: impact us locally, such as this, we have transgender residents, we have immigrants in our community.

1276
02:05:20,146 --> 02:05:25,388
[SPEAKER_16]: All of these decisions coming down from SCOTUS need to get public pushback.

1277
02:05:25,728 --> 02:05:29,329
[SPEAKER_16]: So I just want to go on the record and thank you guys for bringing this forward.

1278
02:05:37,222 --> 02:05:38,222
[SPEAKER_24]: Name and address for the record, please.

1279
02:05:38,602 --> 02:05:40,123
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, my name is Madi.

1280
02:05:41,263 --> 02:05:49,645
[SPEAKER_08]: Address is 161 South Street in Jamaica Plain, but I work in the city of Medford.

1281
02:05:49,665 --> 02:05:54,086
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanted to reiterate, thank you again to President Bears.

1282
02:05:55,226 --> 02:06:05,728
[SPEAKER_08]: As an employee of the city of Medford, but I am also just speaking for myself personally, I work with a lot of youth in the city and many of them are trans or gender nonconforming.

1283
02:06:06,328 --> 02:06:10,951
[SPEAKER_08]: And so this will have a, you know, whatever happens will have a trickle down effect.

1284
02:06:11,031 --> 02:06:15,153
[SPEAKER_08]: So this will affect youth in many years to come.

1285
02:06:15,673 --> 02:06:20,055
[SPEAKER_08]: And so for the city of Medford to make a statement is incredibly important.

1286
02:06:21,056 --> 02:06:24,978
[SPEAKER_08]: And I see so many young people every day.

1287
02:06:26,855 --> 02:06:28,916
[SPEAKER_08]: And I work very closely with them.

1288
02:06:28,936 --> 02:06:49,531
[SPEAKER_08]: And it is especially young queer youth and young trans youth and yeah, for the city to make the statement to stand behind them, especially when there are things like the signage in the church down the street on Salem Street, for them to have the city standing behind them is a really important thing.

1289
02:06:50,692 --> 02:06:51,953
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you again.

1290
02:06:58,705 --> 02:06:58,985
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1291
02:06:59,266 --> 02:07:01,367
[SPEAKER_24]: All right, we'll go to Councilor Leming and then President Bears.

1292
02:07:04,470 --> 02:07:04,811
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

1293
02:07:04,851 --> 02:07:07,373
[SPEAKER_29]: I fully support this resolution.

1294
02:07:07,433 --> 02:07:08,394
[SPEAKER_29]: I'd just like to comment.

1295
02:07:08,434 --> 02:07:18,003
[SPEAKER_29]: Sometimes, as many folks here have been witnessing for the first hour and a half of this meeting, we discuss very dry topics that are nonetheless very important.

1296
02:07:18,775 --> 02:07:35,932
[SPEAKER_29]: to the to the city, transfer of funds, talk about zoning, but resolutions like these are also important because people want to know where their elected officials, where their city stands, and the morale of the city is important.

1297
02:07:36,372 --> 02:07:40,956
[SPEAKER_29]: Now having people feel safe is very important and so

1298
02:07:41,877 --> 02:07:48,642
[SPEAKER_29]: It is possible that sometimes you might be in a position where you can overdo symbolic gestures.

1299
02:07:49,122 --> 02:07:51,744
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't think that this is one of those cases.

1300
02:07:52,004 --> 02:08:07,535
[SPEAKER_29]: It is important for people to know what their government thinks, even in certain cases where they might not necessarily have direct power over those issues, because it does affect people's relationships with their government.

1301
02:08:08,196 --> 02:08:10,357
[SPEAKER_29]: So I would like to make that point.

1302
02:08:14,545 --> 02:08:15,085
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Councilor.

1303
02:08:15,105 --> 02:08:16,365
[SPEAKER_24]: We'll go back to President Bears.

1304
02:08:17,806 --> 02:08:18,766
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you, Madam President.

1305
02:08:19,166 --> 02:08:21,767
[SPEAKER_35]: I was going to make largely a similar point.

1306
02:08:21,807 --> 02:08:34,430
[SPEAKER_35]: I think the idea that there is a mutual exclusivity to this Council dealing with local, quote unquote, local issues versus quote unquote, not local issues is a false equivalence.

1307
02:08:34,510 --> 02:08:35,190
[SPEAKER_35]: It's not real.

1308
02:08:36,947 --> 02:08:52,390
[SPEAKER_35]: And anyone who's been sitting here for the last 2 hours knows that we've spent about 2 hours talking about stabilization funds and school override funds and potholes and, you know, it's not the most fun stuff, but it's what we do.

1309
02:08:53,210 --> 02:08:55,330
[SPEAKER_35]: And this is important too.

1310
02:08:55,890 --> 02:08:59,651
[SPEAKER_35]: So to do both doesn't come at the expense of either.

1311
02:08:59,671 --> 02:09:04,012
[SPEAKER_35]: And as Councilor Leming noted, not only is it a

1312
02:09:06,617 --> 02:09:12,179
[SPEAKER_35]: symbolic gesture per se, but it's a statement of values, and it's a reaffirmation of belonging.

1313
02:09:12,879 --> 02:09:15,780
[SPEAKER_35]: And that's important.

1314
02:09:16,420 --> 02:09:21,202
[SPEAKER_35]: And it doesn't come at the expense of our ability to do anything else that we do.

1315
02:09:22,062 --> 02:09:23,623
[SPEAKER_35]: I know way too much about potholes.

1316
02:09:25,523 --> 02:09:26,763
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you, Madam President.

1317
02:09:26,783 --> 02:09:35,625
[SPEAKER_35]: And I would just amend to include also the Department of Homeland Security at all versus DVD at all decision.

1318
02:09:36,346 --> 02:09:38,726
[SPEAKER_35]: And I will.

1319
02:09:38,946 --> 02:09:44,528
[SPEAKER_35]: And I'll make sure that that amendment goes by email.

1320
02:09:44,548 --> 02:09:49,609
[SPEAKER_35]: That's the decision that allows the deportation to third countries.

1321
02:09:50,009 --> 02:09:54,610
[SPEAKER_35]: So it's a rough week from the Supreme Court so far, and I'm expecting more.

1322
02:09:57,313 --> 02:09:57,573
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1323
02:09:57,913 --> 02:10:00,015
[SPEAKER_24]: I do see we have one more hand on public participation.

1324
02:10:00,035 --> 02:10:03,097
[SPEAKER_24]: Do you mind if we I'll go to Councilor Scarpelli first and then we'll.

1325
02:10:03,637 --> 02:10:05,358
[SPEAKER_40]: If we could sever if we can.

1326
02:10:05,398 --> 02:10:05,658
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you.

1327
02:10:08,720 --> 02:10:09,100
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1328
02:10:09,461 --> 02:10:11,782
[SPEAKER_24]: We have one more hand for public participation on Zoom.

1329
02:10:11,862 --> 02:10:13,163
[SPEAKER_24]: Eileen, I'm going to ask you to unmute.

1330
02:10:13,723 --> 02:10:14,784
[SPEAKER_24]: Name and address for the record, please.

1331
02:10:14,804 --> 02:10:23,189
[SPEAKER_24]: You'll have three minutes.

1332
02:10:23,209 --> 02:10:23,249
[SPEAKER_19]: Hi.

1333
02:10:24,090 --> 02:10:24,670
[SPEAKER_19]: Can you hear me?

1334
02:10:26,108 --> 02:10:26,949
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, please go ahead.

1335
02:10:27,429 --> 02:10:27,789
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

1336
02:10:29,631 --> 02:10:34,895
[SPEAKER_19]: I just want to thank all of the people on the council who voted for this.

1337
02:10:35,375 --> 02:10:37,237
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it's terribly important.

1338
02:10:38,718 --> 02:10:50,587
[SPEAKER_24]: I am the... Eileen, I think we're getting a ringtone, but we're not hearing your voice.

1339
02:10:50,667 --> 02:10:53,069
[SPEAKER_19]: Hello, can I speak now?

1340
02:10:54,577 --> 02:10:56,058
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, we've been hearing you, please proceed.

1341
02:10:56,358 --> 02:10:57,618
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

1342
02:10:58,459 --> 02:11:01,500
[SPEAKER_19]: I am the great grandmother of a trans child.

1343
02:11:02,320 --> 02:11:07,122
[SPEAKER_19]: And so this issue, you know, is a personal one to me.

1344
02:11:07,902 --> 02:11:14,685
[SPEAKER_19]: And I know what my grandson and his wife are going through at this time in history.

1345
02:11:14,725 --> 02:11:16,866
[SPEAKER_19]: They're very frightened for their child.

1346
02:11:17,906 --> 02:11:22,768
[SPEAKER_19]: And so am I. And for all the people like her.

1347
02:11:24,039 --> 02:11:28,360
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm just really proud of all of you for taking this up.

1348
02:11:28,420 --> 02:11:45,004
[SPEAKER_19]: And I also think that the issues we care about and the values that we have should come from the local level, going up to the state level, and then to the federal level, rather than, you know,

1349
02:11:45,997 --> 02:11:47,938
[SPEAKER_19]: stuff coming down from them.

1350
02:11:48,458 --> 02:11:52,859
[SPEAKER_19]: It should be a reflection of what the majority of people in this country want.

1351
02:11:53,399 --> 02:12:07,803
[SPEAKER_19]: And I truly believe the majority of people in the country and in Medford want people to have human rights and health rights and no matter how they identify, you know, that's their business.

1352
02:12:08,643 --> 02:12:10,884
[SPEAKER_19]: So again, thank you very much.

1353
02:12:11,224 --> 02:12:14,005
[SPEAKER_19]: And thank you for allowing me to speak.

1354
02:12:17,393 --> 02:12:17,934
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Eileen.

1355
02:12:26,661 --> 02:12:27,802
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you to Maya.

1356
02:12:27,863 --> 02:12:29,264
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, do we have one more for public participation?

1357
02:12:29,284 --> 02:12:30,905
[SPEAKER_24]: All right.

1358
02:12:31,206 --> 02:12:32,367
[SPEAKER_24]: Name and address for the record, please.

1359
02:12:32,387 --> 02:12:33,327
[SPEAKER_24]: You'll have three minutes, Andy.

1360
02:12:33,848 --> 02:12:36,410
[SPEAKER_03]: Castagnetti, East Medford, Massachusetts.

1361
02:12:36,851 --> 02:12:39,933
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the first I've heard of the Supreme Court ruling.

1362
02:12:40,374 --> 02:12:41,635
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for enlightening me.

1363
02:12:43,545 --> 02:12:45,346
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish everyone peace and happiness.

1364
02:12:46,206 --> 02:12:49,187
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, being a Woodstock graduate, as you know.

1365
02:12:51,808 --> 02:12:55,290
[SPEAKER_03]: But we have some important issues out in the streets, like the potholes.

1366
02:12:57,931 --> 02:13:00,032
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish that was more of a priority.

1367
02:13:00,952 --> 02:13:07,955
[SPEAKER_03]: But on the idea of this ruling, I want to say, God, Jesus, help us all, please.

1368
02:13:18,784 --> 02:13:22,288
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you for your comments.

1369
02:13:22,328 --> 02:13:29,515
[SPEAKER_24]: And I'd say if you're feeling like you're missing out on pothole and pest conversation, I'd invite you to watch the recording of the first two hours of tonight's meeting.

1370
02:13:29,535 --> 02:13:30,877
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you for your comments.

1371
02:13:34,653 --> 02:13:36,254
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm gonna withdraw the B paper.

1372
02:13:36,494 --> 02:13:50,060
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm going to submit a resolution for our July meeting after the completion of the term to review the remainder of the decisions that the Supreme Court may make, and then we can put forward a resolution that speaks fully to their impact.

1373
02:13:50,781 --> 02:13:51,001
[SPEAKER_24]: All right.

1374
02:13:51,441 --> 02:13:51,861
[SPEAKER_24]: So noted.

1375
02:13:52,001 --> 02:13:52,282
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1376
02:13:52,322 --> 02:13:54,042
[SPEAKER_24]: The B paper was withdrawn.

1377
02:13:54,082 --> 02:13:55,063
[SPEAKER_24]: We'll go to Councilor Scarpelli.

1378
02:13:55,643 --> 02:13:55,883
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you.

1379
02:13:55,903 --> 02:13:56,784
[SPEAKER_40]: I appreciate that.

1380
02:13:57,044 --> 02:13:57,704
[SPEAKER_40]: I haven't read that.

1381
02:13:57,784 --> 02:14:02,867
[SPEAKER_40]: I know when you put this forth and I have a chance to read it through, I thought it was very important.

1382
02:14:02,887 --> 02:14:03,447
[SPEAKER_40]: So thank you.

1383
02:14:06,456 --> 02:14:06,676
[SPEAKER_24]: Great.

1384
02:14:07,196 --> 02:14:07,816
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Councilors.

1385
02:14:07,856 --> 02:14:14,878
[SPEAKER_24]: And before we get to the voting, I'd just like to join in thanking President Bears for putting this on our agenda tonight for our consideration.

1386
02:14:14,898 --> 02:14:24,121
[SPEAKER_24]: It should go without saying, but it often does not, that trans people have always existed, will always exist.

1387
02:14:25,421 --> 02:14:29,302
[SPEAKER_24]: It is a, I think in one Councilor's opinion, one of the

1388
02:14:30,546 --> 02:14:39,013
[SPEAKER_24]: proudest achievements of this national project that we have been able to create the equal rights protection under the federal law.

1389
02:14:39,153 --> 02:14:44,157
[SPEAKER_24]: And it is one of the greatest injuries probably of our lifetimes that we will see that being eroded.

1390
02:14:44,437 --> 02:14:52,744
[SPEAKER_24]: And I think when we start making decisions that standing up for our neighbors, equal rights under the law is not worth a few minutes of our time.

1391
02:14:52,784 --> 02:14:55,246
[SPEAKER_24]: That is when we begin to lose our humanity.

1392
02:14:56,227 --> 02:14:59,450
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you to all for their discussion tonight.

1393
02:15:01,990 --> 02:15:07,353

[SPEAKER_41]: Vice President Collins?

1407
02:15:32,765 --> 02:15:33,026
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

1408
02:15:34,246 --> 02:15:36,867
[SPEAKER_24]: Six in favor, one absent, none opposed.

1409
02:15:36,948 --> 02:15:38,008
[SPEAKER_24]: The resolution passes.

1435
02:20:12,161 --> 02:20:13,743
[SPEAKER_24]: Sections 2-701 through 2-720 are reserved.

1436
02:20:20,038 --> 02:20:20,879
[SPEAKER_24]: I'll go to President Bears.

1437
02:20:23,520 --> 02:20:30,985
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you, Madam President, and thank you to my fellow Councilors for your consideration tonight of the proposed Values Aligned Local Investments Ordinance.

1438
02:20:32,186 --> 02:20:36,149
[SPEAKER_35]: First, I want to ground this conversation in our shared humanity and shared values.

1439
02:20:36,949 --> 02:20:46,276
[SPEAKER_35]: When so many people at higher levels of government are pushing for war and private gain, it's our duty in local government to stand up for peace and the public good.

1440
02:20:47,308 --> 02:21:08,682
[SPEAKER_35]: It is irresponsible to invest our local public money in industries that profit from violence, harm, and inhumane treatment of human beings, whether that's the fossil fuel industry, weapons manufacturers, for-profit private prison operators, or companies complicit in human rights violations in far too many countries and against far too many people, especially children.

1441
02:21:09,863 --> 02:21:16,287
[SPEAKER_35]: This ordinance is grounded in common sense, shared values of peace, justice, and compassion for our fellow human beings.

1442
02:21:17,717 --> 02:21:40,542
[SPEAKER_35]: In this moment of warmongering, fearmongering, and rising right-wing extremism coming from the very top levels of our federal government and from so many other governments and dangerous groups around the world, it's more important than ever that we take a comprehensive approach to ensuring that, whenever possible under the law, our public dollars are invested in ways that contribute to the public good, not major forms of harm.

1443
02:21:41,575 --> 02:21:52,278
[SPEAKER_35]: While the financial impact may be limited, we are sending a strong message that Medford stands for peace and safety and against war and violence, both here at home and around the world.

1444
02:21:54,719 --> 02:22:04,642
[SPEAKER_35]: Second, I want to thank the city administration for communicating with me about this ordinance over the last several months and for the legal review and comments by the city's legal counsel that have been incorporated into this draft.

1445
02:22:05,318 --> 02:22:08,760
[SPEAKER_35]: The ordinance structure is very similar to the existing Boston ordinance.

1446
02:22:09,320 --> 02:22:16,743
[SPEAKER_35]: It would require city officials to review our city's investments to see if any funds are currently invested in these industries and make that information public.

1447
02:22:17,423 --> 02:22:27,668
[SPEAKER_35]: Then investments would be sold and when allowed by state law, it would be a priority to reinvest these funds in supportive efforts that directly benefit our local Medford or Massachusetts communities and businesses.

1448
02:22:28,688 --> 02:22:34,911
[SPEAKER_35]: Given state law and the current position of our state pension board, this ordinance would not apply to our city's retirement funds.

1449
02:22:35,909 --> 02:22:50,133
[SPEAKER_35]: This ordinance proposes conditions on investments in a number of harmful industries, including private prisons, fossil fuels, weapons manufacturing, and those contributing to severe violations of inalienable human rights like war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity.

1450
02:22:50,993 --> 02:22:55,534
[SPEAKER_35]: This ordinance does not target or highlight any nation or conflict or company.

1451
02:22:56,533 --> 02:22:57,353
[SPEAKER_35]: That's intentional.

1452
02:22:57,853 --> 02:23:07,216
[SPEAKER_35]: It would apply to all instances of human rights violations across the world based on international humanitarian law and the work of international legal institutions that uphold international law.

1453
02:23:08,216 --> 02:23:14,037
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm confident that our city staff will apply this ordinance to all violators equally and without any fear or favor.

1454
02:23:15,277 --> 02:23:20,939
[SPEAKER_35]: As part of my work to draft this ordinance, I reached out to the city administration and Medford Retirement System for their comments.

1455
02:23:21,818 --> 02:23:36,509
[SPEAKER_35]: I did receive legal review and I invite city and retirement system staff to share any other questions or concerns about the ordinance before any future action by the city council for final passage and ordainment of this ordinance at third reading at a future council meeting.

1456
02:23:37,890 --> 02:23:44,135
[SPEAKER_35]: I look forward to further conversations and meetings with our city staff on this topic as I have offered in my messages over the past several months.

1457
02:23:45,555 --> 02:23:54,640
[SPEAKER_35]: Finally, I wanna thank Medford residents who have reached out to share their support or their concerns about this ordinance by email and those who are present tonight to speak during public comment.

1458
02:23:55,601 --> 02:24:05,546
[SPEAKER_35]: I look forward to more public input, scrutiny and discussion, and I'm happy to engage with anyone who has an interest in or concerns about this ordinance by email or scheduling a conversation.

1459
02:24:05,566 --> 02:24:12,050
[SPEAKER_35]: I've been heartened by the capacity of our Medford community to work through tough issues with respect and civility.

1460
02:24:12,822 --> 02:24:24,885
[SPEAKER_35]: While I know that not everyone agrees with this ordinance, I'm confident that we can have a powerful discussion tonight that voices real disagreements, holds space for real concerns that residents may have, and stays grounded in our shared values.

1461
02:24:25,965 --> 02:24:37,048
[SPEAKER_35]: Peace, justice, compassion, and staunch opposition to all forms of hate against our neighbors and all violent acts against our fellow human beings.

1462
02:24:38,228 --> 02:24:42,409
[SPEAKER_35]: In this moment of rising war, hate, violence, and death,

1463
02:24:43,294 --> 02:24:52,803
[SPEAKER_35]: Stoked by our federal government and right-wing extremists across the world, it is essential that communities stand up to oppose the use of our public funds to perpetuate violence and harm.

1464
02:24:53,584 --> 02:24:57,027
[SPEAKER_35]: This ordinance helps to fulfill that duty and imperative.

1465
02:24:57,928 --> 02:25:01,692
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you again for your consideration, and I motion to approve for first reading.

1466
02:25:10,251 --> 02:25:10,992
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, President Bears.

1467
02:25:11,012 --> 02:25:14,636
[SPEAKER_24]: We'll go first to comments from councilors, and then we will take public participation.

1468
02:25:15,897 --> 02:25:16,998
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Scarpelli, go ahead.

1469
02:25:18,039 --> 02:25:18,660
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you.

1470
02:25:18,680 --> 02:25:20,822
[SPEAKER_40]: Did the Chief of Staff leave?

1471
02:25:20,842 --> 02:25:22,363
[SPEAKER_40]: Because I wanted to get some information.

1472
02:25:22,383 --> 02:25:24,125
[SPEAKER_40]: Is she on Zoom?

1473
02:25:24,145 --> 02:25:29,130
[SPEAKER_40]: Because I appreciate Councilor Villes.

1474
02:25:29,190 --> 02:25:30,011
[SPEAKER_40]: I know we talked today.

1475
02:25:30,031 --> 02:25:30,552
[SPEAKER_40]: I think that

1476
02:25:32,380 --> 02:25:39,105
[SPEAKER_40]: When we move forward with an ordinance, I made sure that I've talked to both our city solicitor.

1477
02:25:39,646 --> 02:25:44,550
[SPEAKER_40]: I've spoken with the director of retirement, Judy Johnson, who's not here.

1478
02:25:44,610 --> 02:25:45,911
[SPEAKER_40]: She's at a conference.

1479
02:25:46,311 --> 02:25:47,412
[SPEAKER_40]: Who's our city treasurer.

1480
02:25:47,892 --> 02:25:49,373
[SPEAKER_40]: I did reach out to the mayor's office.

1481
02:25:49,453 --> 02:26:00,162
[SPEAKER_40]: I think that to put an ordinance through, I think we have to be careful to make sure that we're making sure that we're doing what's right for our community.

1482
02:26:00,635 --> 02:26:08,399
[SPEAKER_40]: in the sense where we've done our due diligence and sitting at the table and crafting an ordinance that everybody feels comfortable about.

1483
02:26:08,719 --> 02:26:10,199
[SPEAKER_40]: And I understand where you're coming from.

1484
02:26:10,219 --> 02:26:15,462
[SPEAKER_40]: I think we talked about that today, but I think that as

1485
02:26:16,362 --> 02:26:24,606
[SPEAKER_40]: not having a sit down yet with the retirement board and the retirement director.

1486
02:26:24,646 --> 02:26:26,007
[SPEAKER_40]: I know they're having a conversation with him.

1487
02:26:26,547 --> 02:26:41,595
[SPEAKER_40]: Although it said that we want to stay away from the pension, the comments that he used was that it'll definitely, no matter what we put in, the pension will definitely be affected indirectly with what we're asking the treasurer to do.

1488
02:26:41,715 --> 02:26:44,196
[SPEAKER_40]: And the treasurer, at another point, is

1489
02:26:45,584 --> 02:26:50,968
[SPEAKER_40]: cannot affect what's happening in the retirement section, so in the pension section.

1490
02:26:51,289 --> 02:27:04,860
[SPEAKER_40]: So there's some strife there that when I talked to the city solicitor that I know KP Law has mentioned that there was some redline changes to your first request for their input.

1491
02:27:05,560 --> 02:27:09,303
[SPEAKER_40]: I haven't heard or seen anything to understand that, neither has any other department.

1492
02:27:11,380 --> 02:27:21,444
[SPEAKER_40]: I also, the chairperson from the trust fund, our trust fund here in Medford, they haven't been part of any conversation.

1493
02:27:21,805 --> 02:27:24,746
[SPEAKER_40]: And that too plays a big deal in what we're doing here.

1494
02:27:24,806 --> 02:27:29,348
[SPEAKER_40]: And this resolution or this ordinance will definitely affect their situation.

1495
02:27:29,388 --> 02:27:34,210
[SPEAKER_40]: So I think we have so many issues.

1496
02:27:35,190 --> 02:27:37,491
[SPEAKER_40]: I think it would be prudent that we would just take a step back

1497
02:27:38,338 --> 02:27:48,808
[SPEAKER_40]: call for a committee of the whole meeting with everybody involved and then put forth a plan that will work if so sees fit.

1498
02:27:48,928 --> 02:27:57,536
[SPEAKER_40]: I think that right now, I know that'll be important to see what the city side says with the administration and what we can do to craft that.

1499
02:27:57,556 --> 02:28:01,380
[SPEAKER_40]: But I don't think as a council, I know you've done a lot of work, but

1500
02:28:02,277 --> 02:28:06,420
[SPEAKER_40]: I haven't been involved in a true discussion of what this is to be.

1501
02:28:07,060 --> 02:28:13,604
[SPEAKER_40]: Honestly, I didn't realize we had a gentleman come up today and said, I'm here to stand with Palestine.

1502
02:28:13,644 --> 02:28:22,570
[SPEAKER_40]: Now, geez, I didn't really understand that this was a Palestinian-Israel issue until we're setting up tents outside.

1503
02:28:22,630 --> 02:28:24,952
[SPEAKER_40]: So I think that we understand

1504
02:28:26,213 --> 02:28:37,596
[SPEAKER_40]: But this has now turned into something bigger than it is and understanding it more in depth will help at least this Councilor who speaks for many different people that reached out to me that are a little confused about this ordinance and how it truly will affect us.

1505
02:28:38,276 --> 02:28:47,198
[SPEAKER_40]: I know your intent and your intent is well adjusted, I'm sure it is, but I do think we haven't done a due diligence to even move forward with any sort of a vote because

1506
02:28:48,204 --> 02:28:51,206
[SPEAKER_40]: Again, just like we've talked about in other situations that we've talked about.

1507
02:28:51,926 --> 02:29:06,834
[SPEAKER_40]: I don't think we've put all the stakeholders in a room so we can discuss and understand the consequences, or even if we have the bandwidth to ask our city treasurer to look at this and see if they can even manage this process.

1508
02:29:06,874 --> 02:29:15,418
[SPEAKER_40]: It might be something that we look at, you know, bringing in an outside party that can look at this process where we're asking to pick

1509
02:29:16,237 --> 02:29:16,577
[SPEAKER_40]: that we can.

1510
02:29:16,597 --> 02:29:20,278
[SPEAKER_40]: You know, bring different, um, entities out of our, um.

1511
02:29:21,598 --> 02:29:25,199
[SPEAKER_40]: Uh you know our investments and say we can we do this?

1512
02:29:25,299 --> 02:29:25,839
[SPEAKER_40]: Can we do that?

1513
02:29:25,879 --> 02:29:28,219
[SPEAKER_40]: So I think it will be important to see what the city says.

1514
02:29:28,359 --> 02:29:34,660
[SPEAKER_40]: Councilor Bears a. I know we talked early today, but I think it's important that for this Councilor for the questions I received.

1515
02:29:34,700 --> 02:29:37,441
[SPEAKER_40]: I think it's important that we slow this down.

1516
02:29:37,601 --> 02:29:38,361
[SPEAKER_40]: We have a meeting

1517
02:29:44,530 --> 02:29:48,312
[SPEAKER_40]: is more structured with more understanding what's being asked.

1518
02:29:48,392 --> 02:29:49,592
[SPEAKER_40]: So I appreciate it, thank you.

1519
02:29:51,193 --> 02:29:52,193
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1520
02:29:52,213 --> 02:29:53,234
[SPEAKER_24]: We'll go back to President Bears.

1521
02:29:54,294 --> 02:29:58,596
[SPEAKER_35]: I thought the Chief of Staff, if the Chief of Staff wants to answer any Councilor Scarpelli's questions first.

1522
02:30:00,397 --> 02:30:02,638
[SPEAKER_24]: Chief of Staff, I'll unmute you if there's anything you want to offer.

1523
02:30:08,756 --> 02:30:11,457
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, President Collins and members of the council.

1524
02:30:11,478 --> 02:30:28,347
[SPEAKER_14]: I think I can just report at this point on the actions that we've taken upon receiving a copy of this ordinance in early May, that I've learned that there's at least two buckets, possibly three, that we need to dive more deeply into.

1525
02:30:28,367 --> 02:30:37,832
[SPEAKER_14]: The retirement area, which has been mentioned, the commissioners of trust funds, and possibly other investments on the city side, which don't,

1526
02:30:38,452 --> 02:30:41,256
[SPEAKER_14]: have a board or committee associated with it.

1527
02:30:41,336 --> 02:30:55,753
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's an important distinction that I'm really learning in real time here because as you know, I think Councilor Scarapelli mentioned, the treasurer collector is actually concerned and has specifically asked

1528
02:30:56,482 --> 02:31:11,545
[SPEAKER_14]: how this ordinance would affect their work, considering that they are the custodian, if you will, for the retirement board, and they are also the custodian under the commissioners of trust funds work, but they don't actually have the authority to make the decisions.

1529
02:31:12,037 --> 02:31:23,281
[SPEAKER_14]: Those decisions get made by those boards and the custodian essentially is the shepherd to make sure that those things are followed through with for a lack of better terms.

1530
02:31:23,681 --> 02:31:30,544
[SPEAKER_14]: And so I really feel like we need a little bit more time to consider those aspects.

1531
02:31:31,109 --> 02:31:37,112
[SPEAKER_14]: and make sure that we don't put our treasurer collector in a position where they're perhaps in violation of an ordinance.

1532
02:31:37,512 --> 02:31:48,577
[SPEAKER_14]: That's something that has been raised by both the retirement, um, uh, executive director and the chair of the commissioners of trust funds, as well as a question to me by our treasurer collector.

1533
02:31:48,597 --> 02:31:53,940
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, so I, I, I think it would be prudent to have additional time.

1534
02:31:54,660 --> 02:31:58,462
[SPEAKER_14]: And, uh, I think that that's the majority of my comments.

1535
02:31:58,502 --> 02:31:58,762
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1536
02:32:03,296 --> 02:32:03,796
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

1537
02:32:03,816 --> 02:32:08,978
[SPEAKER_35]: And I appreciate the Chief of Staff and Councilor Scarpelli for raising those points.

1538
02:32:09,558 --> 02:32:11,318
[SPEAKER_35]: I do want to note two things.

1539
02:32:12,339 --> 02:32:22,962
[SPEAKER_35]: First, there is an incredibly similar ordinance in structure and form in Boston that has been implemented under the existing state law.

1540
02:32:24,122 --> 02:32:27,603
[SPEAKER_35]: And the redline changes from KP law were incorporated into this draft.

1541
02:32:28,366 --> 02:32:36,430
[SPEAKER_35]: I want to note just on the timeline, I submitted this to the chief of staff and to Council on April 4th.

1542
02:32:37,990 --> 02:32:44,073
[SPEAKER_35]: I received with a note that I was intending to put this forward in April, late April or early May.

1543
02:32:45,174 --> 02:32:50,976
[SPEAKER_35]: That certainly would have given us the time for the meetings that Councilor Scarpelli is talking about.

1544
02:32:52,904 --> 02:33:06,612
[SPEAKER_35]: I received a response on April 7th that we're reviewing, I think April 19th that we're still reviewing, and then we got back comments the first week in May.

1545
02:33:07,353 --> 02:33:10,835
[SPEAKER_35]: With those comments, I then communicated with the Chief of Staff.

1546
02:33:12,496 --> 02:33:17,939
[SPEAKER_35]: my willingness to meet with the treasurer collector, with her, with any boards and commissions that were relevant.

1547
02:33:18,500 --> 02:33:22,843
[SPEAKER_35]: I also communicated directly to the chair of the retirement system.

1548
02:33:23,964 --> 02:33:26,966
[SPEAKER_35]: I didn't hear back from the chair of the retirement system and I

1549
02:33:29,047 --> 02:33:36,560
[SPEAKER_35]: You know, the Chief of Staff was working on setting up a meeting, a meeting was scheduled and then unscheduled and you know suddenly it's two months later.

1550
02:33:37,241 --> 02:33:41,449
[SPEAKER_35]: And at that point, I just think there's a fundamental question of

1551
02:33:42,775 --> 02:33:45,637
[SPEAKER_35]: doing things the right way and at the right pace.

1552
02:33:46,438 --> 02:33:52,362
[SPEAKER_35]: And, you know, I don't question that there may be language changes from a legal perspective.

1553
02:33:52,382 --> 02:33:57,705
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm sure we're going to hear from folks tonight that they would like to see language changes from other perspectives.

1554
02:33:58,286 --> 02:34:02,469
[SPEAKER_35]: Passage out of first reading does not preclude that.

1555
02:34:02,649 --> 02:34:06,872
[SPEAKER_35]: What it does do is it lights a fire under all of us to actually get the work done.

1556
02:34:07,874 --> 02:34:17,783
[SPEAKER_35]: So when I ask for the passage for first reading, that means now there's a clock that we have to keep to make those changes, to have those meetings and to get the work done.

1557
02:34:18,543 --> 02:34:26,390
[SPEAKER_35]: And given my experience over the last several months, just with the pace of this process, I feel like that's necessary at this time.

1558
02:34:26,470 --> 02:34:28,872
[SPEAKER_35]: So that's why I'm proposing it and that's why I'll be moving on it.

1559
02:34:29,032 --> 02:34:29,392
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

1560
02:34:31,454 --> 02:34:32,155
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, President Bears.

1561
02:34:34,193 --> 02:34:37,095
[SPEAKER_24]: Are there any additional comments from councillors?

1562
02:34:37,115 --> 02:34:41,698
[SPEAKER_24]: I know there are a lot of people who would like, members of the public who would like to speak on this paper tonight.

1563
02:34:44,220 --> 02:34:45,321
[SPEAKER_24]: All right, seeing none.

1564
02:34:46,822 --> 02:34:49,624
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, sorry, Councilor Scarpelli, I didn't see your mic turn on.

1565
02:34:49,644 --> 02:35:00,091
[SPEAKER_40]: I know people have been standing here all evening, but I think that, I know that you want to get that clock started, President Villes, but I think we need to move, we need to move slower.

1566
02:35:00,151 --> 02:35:02,873
[SPEAKER_40]: So I'm going to invoke my right for,

1567
02:35:03,636 --> 02:35:20,360
[SPEAKER_40]: chapter uh mass general law chapter 43 section 22 to delay any further discussions for uh till our next meeting i think it's important that um after listening to the chief of staff talking to the the um the um parties involved that

1568
02:35:21,324 --> 02:35:23,005
[SPEAKER_40]: might have contradicted what you just said.

1569
02:35:23,085 --> 02:35:32,288
[SPEAKER_40]: So I'd rather not move forward until we have our questions answered before we listen to anybody and waste anybody else's time this evening.

1570
02:35:32,348 --> 02:35:36,590
[SPEAKER_40]: So I invoke that right of section 22 and end all debate.

1571
02:35:46,254 --> 02:35:48,455
[SPEAKER_35]: Public participation under suspension.

1572
02:35:50,608 --> 02:35:55,319
[SPEAKER_24]: on the motion to take public participation under suspension by President Bearsar, seconded by Councilor Leming.

1573
02:35:56,000 --> 02:35:57,103
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1574
02:36:31,748 --> 02:36:32,909
[SPEAKER_41]: Councilor Callahan is absent.

1575
02:36:34,310 --> 02:36:34,850
[SPEAKER_41]: President Bears?

1576
02:36:35,711 --> 02:36:35,951
[SPEAKER_33]: Yes.

1577
02:36:37,732 --> 02:36:38,753
[SPEAKER_41]: Councilor Lazzaro?

1578
02:36:39,473 --> 02:36:39,753
[SPEAKER_41]: Yes.

1579
02:36:40,994 --> 02:36:41,535
[SPEAKER_41]: Councilor Leming?

1580
02:36:41,595 --> 02:36:41,815
[SPEAKER_41]: Yes.

1581
02:36:42,215 --> 02:36:42,896
[SPEAKER_41]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1582
02:36:42,916 --> 02:36:42,976
[SPEAKER_41]: Yes.

1583
02:36:43,636 --> 02:36:44,217
[SPEAKER_41]: Councilor Tseng?

1584
02:36:44,997 --> 02:36:45,237
[SPEAKER_41]: Yes.

1585
02:36:46,478 --> 02:36:47,078
[SPEAKER_41]: President Collins?

1586
02:36:47,959 --> 02:36:48,199
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

1587
02:36:48,920 --> 02:36:50,921
[SPEAKER_24]: Six in favor, one absent, none opposed.

1588
02:36:51,501 --> 02:36:52,042
[SPEAKER_24]: Motion passes.

1589
02:37:02,018 --> 02:37:07,221
[SPEAKER_35]: All right, so what that means is we're not going to be taking action tonight.

1590
02:37:08,842 --> 02:37:19,749
[SPEAKER_35]: The action will be postponed to a future date, but we have motion to take the public participation section of the meeting to allow the people who are here to say their piece, technically you can say

1591
02:37:20,959 --> 02:37:26,381
[SPEAKER_35]: Whatever you want about anything, I have a feeling I understand what the people here are going to be talking about.

1592
02:37:27,622 --> 02:37:33,084
[SPEAKER_35]: Each person will have three minutes, and I will take alternating from in person and on zoom.

1593
02:37:35,623 --> 02:37:36,984
[SPEAKER_35]: Name and address for the record please.

1594
02:37:37,364 --> 02:37:43,968
[SPEAKER_48]: My name is Claire Sheridan I live in Medford at 190 High Street apartment 110.

1595
02:37:44,868 --> 02:37:52,653
[SPEAKER_48]: I urge the city of Medford to divest from corporations that promote the manufacture of weapons of mass destruction

1596
02:37:53,213 --> 02:38:01,438
[SPEAKER_48]: chemical and biological weapons, as well as explosive incendiaries and poison gases.

1597
02:38:01,959 --> 02:38:06,421
[SPEAKER_48]: And I'll throw in fossil fuels and private prisons for good measure.

1598
02:38:07,242 --> 02:38:17,869
[SPEAKER_48]: Some of them you know well, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, L3Harris, Boeing, RTX Corporation, the list goes on and on.

1599
02:38:18,269 --> 02:38:20,851
[SPEAKER_48]: They are war profiteers and you know it.

1600
02:38:21,927 --> 02:38:27,348
[SPEAKER_48]: I am weary of my tax money going to these companies with no say from me.

1601
02:38:28,208 --> 02:38:31,029
[SPEAKER_48]: Massachusetts was the first state in the U.S.

1602
02:38:31,489 --> 02:38:33,869
[SPEAKER_48]: to divest from South Africa.

1603
02:38:34,569 --> 02:38:41,890
[SPEAKER_48]: Let Medford be the first city in Massachusetts to do the right thing and divest from these corporations.

1604
02:38:43,051 --> 02:38:51,212
[SPEAKER_48]: And yes, Massachusetts does have a responsible investment act that is currently before the state legislature.

1605
02:38:52,326 --> 02:38:59,272
[SPEAKER_48]: And by the way, the city of Portland, Maine divested, so you might as well look at them for some model.

1606
02:38:59,533 --> 02:39:00,033
[SPEAKER_48]: Thank you.

1607
02:39:00,053 --> 02:39:06,679
[SPEAKER_35]: We'll go to Dennis on Zoom.

1608
02:39:06,719 --> 02:39:08,541
[SPEAKER_35]: Dennis, name and address for the record, please.

1609
02:39:08,561 --> 02:39:09,362
[SPEAKER_35]: You'll have three minutes.

1610
02:39:15,465 --> 02:39:16,186
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, hi.

1611
02:39:16,926 --> 02:39:22,592
[SPEAKER_12]: So, yes, my name is Dennis Detling Kalthofer and I live at 120 North Street in Medford.

1612
02:39:24,193 --> 02:39:29,759
[SPEAKER_12]: So, I think this is a very important resolution.

1613
02:39:29,779 --> 02:39:37,566
[SPEAKER_12]: I deeply believe that we should do all we can, personally and as a city,

1614
02:39:40,039 --> 02:39:50,286
[SPEAKER_12]: to invest our savings and efforts into enterprises that benefit people on the planet and not into those which contribute to environmental destruction, human rights abuses, or genocide.

1615
02:39:51,467 --> 02:40:08,578
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think it's very, this is a lot, there's a lot at stake right now with the attack on Iran and other things that are going on, the shift in the budget to military priorities,

1616
02:40:09,580 --> 02:40:22,864
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that it's important that we put our money where our mouth is in terms of our investments when the majority of Americans oppose these sorts of actions.

1617
02:40:25,385 --> 02:40:35,708
[SPEAKER_12]: I've read the proposed ordinance, and I think that it's similar to an ordinance, a shorter one and simpler one, that Northampton has passed.

1618
02:40:37,753 --> 02:40:45,494
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't see why we can't overcome any legal technicalities and pass it as soon as possible.

1619
02:40:46,815 --> 02:41:01,017
[SPEAKER_12]: And I also think that in addition, we should create a separate home rule petition to Massachusetts to do similar divestment from retirement funds for the city.

1620
02:41:02,757 --> 02:41:07,178
[SPEAKER_12]: I understand why this was excluded in this particular ordinance.

1621
02:41:08,433 --> 02:41:13,175
[SPEAKER_12]: because that way it doesn't go contrary to state law.

1622
02:41:13,695 --> 02:41:23,800
[SPEAKER_12]: But I think that in addition, we should have this home rule petition to allow us to divest retirement funds as well.

1623
02:41:25,221 --> 02:41:29,142
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's it.

1624
02:41:30,143 --> 02:41:34,565
[SPEAKER_12]: So please consider passing this as soon as possible.

1625
02:41:36,706 --> 02:41:37,066
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

1626
02:41:39,924 --> 02:41:42,054
[SPEAKER_35]: Name and address for the record at the podium and you'll have three minutes.

1627
02:41:46,686 --> 02:41:48,907
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, President Bears and the council.

1628
02:41:48,927 --> 02:41:57,591
[SPEAKER_20]: I am Rabbi Jessica Delera Nussbaum, a Medford homeowner and the rabbi of the only synagogue in our city, Temple Shalom of 475 Winthrop Street.

1629
02:41:58,451 --> 02:42:12,917
[SPEAKER_20]: Some of you may also know me as a regular warden of our polling places here in Medford and a frequent speaker and attendee of municipal ceremonies since I was raised with a strong sense of civic responsibility and a mandate to show up in support of the orderly, egalitarian functioning of our government at every level.

1630
02:42:13,337 --> 02:42:22,841
[SPEAKER_20]: Due to my respect for the diversity of views in my own synagogue community, I almost never make public comment on partisan politics in my role as a rabbi, however I feel compelled to do so today.

1631
02:42:23,501 --> 02:42:29,663
[SPEAKER_20]: I was awakened early this morning to cries of alarm from several of my congregants regarding this ordinance on tonight's agenda.

1632
02:42:30,004 --> 02:42:33,565
[SPEAKER_20]: In particular, despite the careful veneer of neutrality on paper,

1633
02:42:33,985 --> 02:42:46,037
[SPEAKER_20]: They were outraged that in anti-Israel circles, it was being promoted openly as a tool of the boycott, divest, and sanctions movement against Israel and as a test case for pushing through similar measures throughout Massachusetts.

1634
02:42:46,758 --> 02:42:50,542
[SPEAKER_20]: An email forwarded to me proclaimed this as important BDS news.

1635
02:42:51,222 --> 02:42:57,564
[SPEAKER_20]: encouraging people to show up so that Medford would be the first city in the state to make it easier for other municipalities.

1636
02:42:57,884 --> 02:43:02,166
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's also said, do not share on social media in red capital letters.

1637
02:43:02,266 --> 02:43:06,547
[SPEAKER_20]: If everything were above board here, why shouldn't their supporters proudly declare themselves?

1638
02:43:07,067 --> 02:43:14,170
[SPEAKER_20]: My congregants alarm stemmed just as much from this attempt to keep this ordinance and its intended impact under the radar as from the comment content itself.

1639
02:43:15,210 --> 02:43:16,932
[SPEAKER_20]: I did not know that this was happening.

1640
02:43:16,992 --> 02:43:20,895
[SPEAKER_20]: I had not heard from any of my contacts at City Hall that this was under consideration.

1641
02:43:21,436 --> 02:43:32,945
[SPEAKER_20]: The fact in and of itself has stoked fear and outrage among my congregants who are still repairing their trust in this city council after the last minute poisoned rewording of the previous resolution about the Gaza war last year.

1642
02:43:33,990 --> 02:43:42,216
[SPEAKER_20]: At that time, I told Vice President Collins that I was strongly against the city council wading into international diplomacy at all.

1643
02:43:42,296 --> 02:43:45,839
[SPEAKER_20]: It's an issue on which you have no legitimate involvement or leverage.

1644
02:43:46,239 --> 02:43:49,922
[SPEAKER_20]: That was simply not the purview of municipal government.

1645
02:43:49,982 --> 02:43:50,802
[SPEAKER_20]: This is divisive.

1646
02:43:51,082 --> 02:43:55,105
[SPEAKER_20]: You want people to feel safe and cared for.

1647
02:43:55,566 --> 02:43:57,387
[SPEAKER_20]: The Jewish community does not feel that.

1648
02:43:57,427 --> 02:44:01,050
[SPEAKER_20]: You'll hear from other people behind me speaking as Jews

1649
02:44:01,830 --> 02:44:14,813
[SPEAKER_20]: It is not a universal feeling, but I am here to tell you that many, many Jews feel like they are being thrown under the bus by an ordinance like this that pretends to be neutral, when in reality it is full of problems, logistical problems.

1650
02:44:14,893 --> 02:44:25,455
[SPEAKER_20]: Who gets to decide what rules and which classifications a company will have in terms of does it or does it not support human rights violations?

1651
02:44:25,895 --> 02:44:43,640
[SPEAKER_20]: And leaving the name of Israel off doesn't do it because you have sketched the worst accusations that have been leveled against Israel by its detractors at a time that the Jewish community, many of us have family, friends, colleagues, spiritual, and yes, financial ties to Israel.

1652
02:44:45,100 --> 02:44:47,881
[SPEAKER_20]: We do not feel safe when it's being treated in this manner.

1653
02:44:48,561 --> 02:44:48,882
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1654
02:44:49,742 --> 02:44:50,102
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

1655
02:44:54,316 --> 02:44:55,839
[SPEAKER_35]: We'll go to Zoom.

1656
02:44:55,900 --> 02:44:57,724
[SPEAKER_35]: Name and address for the record, please.

1657
02:44:58,004 --> 02:44:59,087
[SPEAKER_35]: You'll have three minutes.

1658
02:45:00,617 --> 02:45:01,258
[SPEAKER_15]: Great, thank you.

1659
02:45:01,338 --> 02:45:03,259
[SPEAKER_15]: Penny Taylor, 29 Martin Street.

1660
02:45:04,040 --> 02:45:12,046
[SPEAKER_15]: I wanted to first thank President Bears and the whole city council for taking this up and for dedicated and inspiring organizers for getting it to this point.

1661
02:45:12,907 --> 02:45:13,908
[SPEAKER_15]: I support this ordinance.

1662
02:45:14,188 --> 02:45:29,140
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't want our money invested in weapons manufacturers or other companies that are complicit with and profiting off harming and killing people directly with a side effect of really polluting and harming our global environment through toxic materials and processes.

1663
02:45:31,022 --> 02:45:40,789
[SPEAKER_15]: I feel like this is extra relevant on this extremely hot day, the kind of environmental impact of so many of these companies, including weapons manufacturers.

1664
02:45:41,309 --> 02:45:42,890
[SPEAKER_15]: I do think this is an urgent issue.

1665
02:45:43,551 --> 02:45:45,512
[SPEAKER_15]: And as others have pointed out, there are models.

1666
02:45:45,733 --> 02:45:48,234
[SPEAKER_15]: It sounds like Northampton and Portland, Maine had caught my eye.

1667
02:45:48,294 --> 02:45:54,539
[SPEAKER_15]: So I feel like municipal government to government, you can check in with them and see what's working and not and make sure it works for you.

1668
02:45:57,998 --> 02:46:04,900
[SPEAKER_15]: I also just, me personally, I am a public employee at a place that I am not proud of its investments.

1669
02:46:05,020 --> 02:46:16,904
[SPEAKER_15]: And I would be really happy if the city council where I work would take this up seriously and have serious conversations about what it means to be complicit and have our money invested in these types of companies.

1670
02:46:16,924 --> 02:46:19,965
[SPEAKER_15]: So thank you for bringing it up and I'll yield my time.

1671
02:46:19,985 --> 02:46:23,367
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

1672
02:46:23,387 --> 02:46:24,227
[SPEAKER_35]: We'll go to the podium.

1673
02:46:25,175 --> 02:46:27,816
[SPEAKER_35]: Name and address for the record, please, and you'll have three minutes.

1674
02:46:28,656 --> 02:46:30,857
[SPEAKER_37]: Good evening again, Nick Giurleo, 40 Robinson Road.

1675
02:46:31,237 --> 02:46:36,400
[SPEAKER_37]: So I'll just devote my time to just putting some questions on the record that hopefully the council will be able to answer.

1676
02:46:36,640 --> 02:46:40,621
[SPEAKER_37]: So the first question is, what is the city invested in currently?

1677
02:46:40,641 --> 02:46:43,162
[SPEAKER_37]: And where can a member of the public get that information?

1678
02:46:43,182 --> 02:46:48,924
[SPEAKER_37]: I ask that because part of this ordinance is not just about investing, it's also about divesting.

1679
02:46:48,984 --> 02:46:52,246
[SPEAKER_37]: So I think it's important to know what we're invested in currently.

1680
02:46:53,207 --> 02:47:01,573
[SPEAKER_37]: The other question would be is just regarding subsection D of section 2 dash 697 so that's the part about no investment.

1681
02:47:02,153 --> 02:47:05,155
[SPEAKER_37]: of city funds and entities that severely violate human rights.

1682
02:47:05,496 --> 02:47:09,259
[SPEAKER_37]: I think it's a great idea, but I'm a little concerned about the vagueness.

1683
02:47:09,899 --> 02:47:14,503
[SPEAKER_37]: My question regarding this is who determines what a severe human rights violation is?

1684
02:47:15,504 --> 02:47:24,311
[SPEAKER_37]: The ordinance does reference international legal community, but what entity in the city is going to determine what the international community has to say about that?

1685
02:47:24,811 --> 02:47:25,692
[SPEAKER_37]: Is it the treasurer?

1686
02:47:25,752 --> 02:47:27,413
[SPEAKER_37]: Is it the council, the law department?

1687
02:47:27,997 --> 02:47:31,058
[SPEAKER_37]: Do we have anybody competent to do that at the local level?

1688
02:47:31,278 --> 02:47:36,240
[SPEAKER_37]: It seems not something that anybody in local government really would have knowledge about.

1689
02:47:36,260 --> 02:47:38,121
[SPEAKER_37]: So those are the questions I put out there.

1690
02:47:38,401 --> 02:47:38,721
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

1691
02:47:40,922 --> 02:47:41,562
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

1692
02:47:42,322 --> 02:47:44,063
[SPEAKER_35]: There's no hands on Zoom, so we'll stay at the podium.

1693
02:47:44,103 --> 02:47:45,284
[SPEAKER_35]: Name and address for the record, please.

1694
02:47:45,324 --> 02:47:46,104
[SPEAKER_35]: You have three minutes.

1695
02:47:47,601 --> 02:47:49,242
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, my name is Anna Meyer.

1696
02:47:49,342 --> 02:47:52,564
[SPEAKER_09]: I live at 6 Douglas Road in Medford, Massachusetts.

1697
02:47:53,905 --> 02:48:00,150
[SPEAKER_09]: I teach US history, and I really appreciate the ability to every year look at the course of US history.

1698
02:48:00,270 --> 02:48:07,575
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that fundamentally, we have to understand that our economy was started by stealing land, by exploiting labor.

1699
02:48:07,595 --> 02:48:12,098
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's only then been shaped by continued ecological extraction.

1700
02:48:13,038 --> 02:48:14,239
[SPEAKER_09]: and the industry of war.

1701
02:48:14,319 --> 02:48:15,300
[SPEAKER_09]: It blows my mind every year.

1702
02:48:15,500 --> 02:48:22,943
[SPEAKER_09]: The US economy spent more money on World War II than it had in the previous however many years of its history combined and then doubled.

1703
02:48:23,164 --> 02:48:25,345
[SPEAKER_09]: This country is built on war.

1704
02:48:25,425 --> 02:48:33,469
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think it's really easy to feel hopeless about that as our president starts wars with that congressional approval.

1705
02:48:33,509 --> 02:48:36,831
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that so often so much feels out of our control.

1706
02:48:36,971 --> 02:48:38,011
[SPEAKER_09]: And I am so grateful.

1707
02:48:40,092 --> 02:48:57,536
[SPEAKER_09]: for working on this ordinance, because I think that it is a moment of calling back local control and saying that there is local money in Medford that are invested in corporations, specifically there's money invested in Lockheed Martin and Chevron that are doing harm in the world.

1708
02:48:57,576 --> 02:49:04,617
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think this is a moment of imagining what an economy is like and what a community is like when our money is invested where our values are.

1709
02:49:05,697 --> 02:49:08,459
[SPEAKER_09]: Specifically, I want to talk about immigration.

1710
02:49:08,499 --> 02:49:11,920
[SPEAKER_09]: I also work as an advocate for immigrants in Massachusetts.

1711
02:49:12,640 --> 02:49:16,282
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to call specific attention to the section of this ordinance.

1712
02:49:16,702 --> 02:49:20,204
[SPEAKER_09]: That would mean that Med for Money is not investing in detention centers.

1713
02:49:20,664 --> 02:49:23,465
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm specifically concerned about the students, college students,

1714
02:49:24,686 --> 02:49:37,070
[SPEAKER_09]: High school students are being kidnapped off the street and increasingly brought to for profit detention centers, where they're kept without due process where they're kept without access to the medical needs that they have they're being legitimately discriminated against.

1715
02:49:37,850 --> 02:49:39,411
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that it would really.

1716
02:49:40,271 --> 02:49:45,013
[SPEAKER_09]: And I would also just name like specifically in Medford like people are kidnapped off the street last weekend and taken to an ice jail.

1717
02:49:45,573 --> 02:49:53,239
[SPEAKER_09]: in Burlington where we know people are being kept on floors, they're sleeping there, given Mylar blankets or eating crackers for dinner.

1718
02:49:53,459 --> 02:49:56,181
[SPEAKER_09]: This is not where we want Medford's money to be invested in.

1719
02:49:56,881 --> 02:50:01,064
[SPEAKER_09]: And I appreciate people have already raised concerns tonight about the logistics of this ordinance.

1720
02:50:01,125 --> 02:50:04,967
[SPEAKER_09]: And I appreciate that I cannot speak to all of the specifics of that.

1721
02:50:05,808 --> 02:50:09,851
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think even though it's complicated, there's really good work that needs to be done.

1722
02:50:09,911 --> 02:50:13,053
[SPEAKER_09]: And I would urge city councilors to take it on as

1723
02:50:14,254 --> 02:50:25,582
[SPEAKER_09]: an act of good faith that it is worth this work to be doing, especially as a way of inspiring other cities and towns of looking carefully at their investments and making sure that they're invested in the things that stand for those city's values.

1724
02:50:25,862 --> 02:50:26,202
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1725
02:50:26,222 --> 02:50:32,766
[SPEAKER_33]: Let's stay at the podium.

1726
02:50:32,826 --> 02:50:34,007
[SPEAKER_33]: Name and address for the record, please.

1727
02:50:34,027 --> 02:50:34,728
[SPEAKER_33]: You have three minutes.

1728
02:50:36,789 --> 02:50:37,029
[SPEAKER_31]: Oh, OK.

1729
02:50:37,049 --> 02:50:37,710
[SPEAKER_31]: There's no one on Zoom.

1730
02:50:37,730 --> 02:50:37,970
[SPEAKER_31]: Sorry.

1731
02:50:38,850 --> 02:50:39,671
[SPEAKER_31]: Nate Merritt, 373 Riverside Ave.

1732
02:50:42,642 --> 02:50:44,383
[SPEAKER_31]: Congratulations, City of Medford.

1733
02:50:44,543 --> 02:50:52,148
[SPEAKER_31]: You've once again astounded the community in how you can bring a highly divisive and polarizing resolution to the floor to divide your community.

1734
02:50:52,909 --> 02:50:53,309
[SPEAKER_31]: Congrats.

1735
02:50:54,690 --> 02:50:56,191
[SPEAKER_31]: I have several issues with this paper.

1736
02:50:57,792 --> 02:51:01,655
[SPEAKER_31]: In terms of the environment, oh, and I should preface, by the way, I do not like war.

1737
02:51:01,775 --> 02:51:03,075
[SPEAKER_31]: I do not like killing people.

1738
02:51:03,096 --> 02:51:09,880
[SPEAKER_31]: As an EMT, I've probably seen more of other people's blood on my hands to help them than I challenge anybody in this room.

1739
02:51:10,871 --> 02:51:13,233
[SPEAKER_31]: So that said, unfortunately, bad things happen.

1740
02:51:13,994 --> 02:51:17,256
[SPEAKER_31]: And there are people sometimes that try to do not so nice things.

1741
02:51:17,977 --> 02:51:30,907
[SPEAKER_31]: So we can demonize defense companies, of which there are several where people in your city go to work, and they don't go to work to try to go kill people, but maybe also to defend some of our uniformed service members.

1742
02:51:31,208 --> 02:51:33,750
[SPEAKER_31]: You have a city Councilor here who's in the Navy.

1743
02:51:34,803 --> 02:51:37,624
[SPEAKER_31]: Who makes the ship if he serves on or any of the equipment?

1744
02:51:38,605 --> 02:51:43,007
[SPEAKER_31]: And therefore, do you think that that city Councilor is also a person who is a warmonger?

1745
02:51:44,868 --> 02:51:50,651
[SPEAKER_31]: I would say there are plenty of good people in this city that make equipment to defend people like him and others.

1746
02:51:50,871 --> 02:51:52,271
[SPEAKER_31]: I come from a military family.

1747
02:51:52,632 --> 02:51:57,994
[SPEAKER_31]: So demonizing companies like MIT, Draper,

1748
02:52:00,102 --> 02:52:11,728
[SPEAKER_31]: Hanscom Air Force Base, which employs a lot of people here, General Electric, the wording in this, where it says any company that does any weapons manufacturing, I hate to tell you folks, this is reality, this isn't utopia.

1749
02:52:12,448 --> 02:52:19,152
[SPEAKER_31]: Same with a local company, if they're scrubbing toilets in a jail, therefore they derive their revenue from that.

1750
02:52:19,752 --> 02:52:24,814
[SPEAKER_31]: You're demonizing potential janitors or building maintenance folks that are just trying to make a living.

1751
02:52:26,675 --> 02:52:27,676
[SPEAKER_31]: In terms of the environment,

1752
02:52:28,508 --> 02:52:33,533
[SPEAKER_31]: Electricity right now, for the most part, that heats our homes, lets our fire trucks go down the street.

1753
02:52:33,793 --> 02:52:35,254
[SPEAKER_31]: There's no electric fire truck, folks.

1754
02:52:35,454 --> 02:52:36,795
[SPEAKER_31]: It ain't going to happen anytime soon.

1755
02:52:38,377 --> 02:52:41,600
[SPEAKER_31]: If we stopped all fossil fuels today, society would fall apart.

1756
02:52:42,100 --> 02:52:43,101
[SPEAKER_31]: That's a sad fact.

1757
02:52:43,721 --> 02:52:47,185
[SPEAKER_31]: So NVIDIA is one of the richest companies, right?

1758
02:52:47,405 --> 02:52:50,467
[SPEAKER_31]: Anybody who follows the stock market knows that NVIDIA stock is triple.

1759
02:52:50,808 --> 02:52:51,488
[SPEAKER_31]: Great investment.

1760
02:52:51,809 --> 02:52:55,031
[SPEAKER_31]: How good do you think all the servers that are powered by NVIDIA chips

1761
02:52:55,944 --> 02:53:00,485
[SPEAKER_31]: is for the environment, the electrical consumption, the processes to make those chips.

1762
02:53:01,786 --> 02:53:03,806
[SPEAKER_31]: I think you've opened up a Pandora's box.

1763
02:53:04,627 --> 02:53:10,769
[SPEAKER_31]: And there are plenty of good people in this city that work for companies and aren't necessarily warmongers.

1764
02:53:11,249 --> 02:53:15,650
[SPEAKER_31]: But now you've made it this city unfriendly for several companies and industries.

1765
02:53:15,750 --> 02:53:18,151
[SPEAKER_31]: And it doesn't surprise me that General Electric picked up and left.

1766
02:53:18,980 --> 02:53:20,801
[SPEAKER_31]: Because they probably saw this one coming down the road.

1767
02:53:21,201 --> 02:53:24,683
[SPEAKER_31]: And if that's in Boston, where they said they were going to have their headquarters, well, guess what?

1768
02:53:25,023 --> 02:53:29,906
[SPEAKER_31]: They make any of their revenue from manufacturer sale of weapons of any kind.

1769
02:53:30,246 --> 02:53:34,609
[SPEAKER_31]: They also make a lot of very good products that help people, including in health care.

1770
02:53:35,309 --> 02:53:39,031
[SPEAKER_31]: So I urge you to reconsider the language of this and stop dividing the city.

1771
02:53:39,332 --> 02:53:39,652
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

1772
02:53:43,933 --> 02:53:46,458
[SPEAKER_33]: name and address for record you have three.

1773
02:53:46,518 --> 02:53:53,572
[SPEAKER_01]: New to Massachusetts I came this far because I think it's so important really important that people here got a message.

1774
02:53:54,422 --> 02:53:58,043
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello for A4P community, Arlington for Palestine.

1775
02:53:58,083 --> 02:54:01,005
[SPEAKER_01]: We have important BDS news from our friends from Medford.

1776
02:54:01,505 --> 02:54:08,607
[SPEAKER_01]: So even though you might think this is neutral, everybody here, and you can see by the casillas here, this is about Israel.

1777
02:54:08,968 --> 02:54:12,249
[SPEAKER_01]: This is about Gaza, no matter how much they try to disguise it.

1778
02:54:12,729 --> 02:54:22,353
[SPEAKER_01]: One way that you could definitely tell is if you look at D, it's not saying that it's countries that do bad things determined by the United States.

1779
02:54:23,093 --> 02:54:24,134
[SPEAKER_01]: Nowhere here does it say it.

1780
02:54:24,254 --> 02:54:27,536
[SPEAKER_01]: It says international legal and humanitarian.

1781
02:54:27,616 --> 02:54:27,976
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?

1782
02:54:28,396 --> 02:54:33,199
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the UN has been known to be extremely anti-Israel.

1783
02:54:33,359 --> 02:54:34,920
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why they want the UN.

1784
02:54:36,081 --> 02:54:52,210
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to show you facts, in 2024, the United General Assembly from the UN had 17 resolutions against Israel, a country surrounded by seven huge Arab neighbors, which is the size of New Jersey.

1785
02:54:53,418 --> 02:54:57,461
[SPEAKER_01]: being attacked by Iran, by other huge places.

1786
02:54:58,022 --> 02:55:05,608
[SPEAKER_01]: Guess how many they had against North Korea, Iran, Russia, China, Sudan, all total six, okay?

1787
02:55:06,208 --> 02:55:12,353
[SPEAKER_01]: So nothing, and after October 7th, when October 6th, there was peace.

1788
02:55:13,254 --> 02:55:15,375
[SPEAKER_01]: October 7th came, did the UN condemn it?

1789
02:55:16,036 --> 02:55:20,359
[SPEAKER_01]: Has the UN condemned the use of the Palestinian, of Hamas, of human shields?

1790
02:55:21,060 --> 02:55:21,200
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

1791
02:55:22,210 --> 02:55:27,253
[SPEAKER_01]: But what do we have time and time again, the UN is going after Israel.

1792
02:55:27,413 --> 02:55:31,254
[SPEAKER_01]: This is why they want you to follow the UN guidelines.

1793
02:55:31,335 --> 02:55:34,316
[SPEAKER_01]: This is why they want you to follow international guidelines.

1794
02:55:34,656 --> 02:55:40,079
[SPEAKER_01]: The UN has vetoed 45 times resolutions against Israel.

1795
02:55:40,559 --> 02:55:42,380
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to understand they're not neutral.

1796
02:55:42,500 --> 02:55:46,482
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not the wonderful UN that we had in fact.

1797
02:55:46,983 --> 02:56:03,683
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of these, the people who are for this are funded as JP other places are funded by people who have been linked to terrorist organizations you've got to understand, this is not neutral, this is anti Israel, they know it.

1798
02:56:04,263 --> 02:56:21,050
[SPEAKER_01]: We know it, I really wish that you understood how important this is, and the anti Israel stuff, it's not just anti Israel, as you know, from the people who were killed at the AJC, and that the Molotov cocktails that were that were thrown in Boulder where children were there.

1799
02:56:22,178 --> 02:56:23,718
[SPEAKER_01]: They are against Jews.

1800
02:56:24,179 --> 02:56:30,420
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is going to be seen not as something neutral, wonderful peace, but something against Jews.

1801
02:56:30,560 --> 02:56:36,642
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other thing, I can't believe there's a teacher here who's saying we shouldn't have fought World War II.

1802
02:56:37,062 --> 02:56:49,785
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it is lovely to want peace, but if Iran is building a nuclear bomb, or if not, if Hitler was going around to kill everybody and wasn't going to stop, do you really think we should not have fought against them?

1803
02:56:51,102 --> 02:56:51,582
[SPEAKER_35]: It's ridiculous.

1804
02:56:51,722 --> 02:56:54,683
[SPEAKER_35]: I don't think anyone is saying we shouldn't have fought World War II.

1805
02:56:54,903 --> 02:56:55,283
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me?

1806
02:56:55,303 --> 02:56:58,684
[SPEAKER_01]: She said we spend more money on World War II.

1807
02:56:58,724 --> 02:57:03,646
[SPEAKER_35]: That was a reference to the fact that war is intent and inherent in our economic development.

1808
02:57:03,666 --> 02:57:04,246
[SPEAKER_35]: I don't think it was.

1809
02:57:05,386 --> 02:57:06,007
[SPEAKER_35]: Please, thank you.

1810
02:57:06,287 --> 02:57:06,967
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm running this meeting.

1811
02:57:07,027 --> 02:57:12,909
[SPEAKER_35]: I don't think it was an intended statement to say that World War II was not a righteous war.

1812
02:57:13,089 --> 02:57:18,070
[SPEAKER_35]: And quite frankly, I got a number of messages today from fascists.

1813
02:57:18,170 --> 02:57:18,851
[SPEAKER_35]: So thank you.

1814
02:57:22,383 --> 02:57:25,304
[SPEAKER_35]: No, I'm saying that I received messages in my inbox.

1815
02:57:25,364 --> 02:57:25,824
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

1816
02:57:27,585 --> 02:57:30,086
[SPEAKER_35]: No, guys, guys, don't engage.

1817
02:57:30,186 --> 02:57:40,390
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm just saying, if we're going to talk about World War II, we're going to talk about the full scope of the communications that elected officials receive in this country.

1818
02:57:40,570 --> 02:57:44,131
[SPEAKER_35]: And I don't think anyone in this country or in this city or in this world

1819
02:57:45,792 --> 02:57:48,475
[SPEAKER_35]: wants anyone to be subject to violence.

1820
02:57:49,095 --> 02:57:52,718
[SPEAKER_35]: That is the exact opposite intent that I put forward with this resolution.

1821
02:57:53,839 --> 02:57:54,260
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

1822
02:57:55,841 --> 02:57:56,362
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm sorry.

1823
02:57:56,902 --> 02:57:59,104
[SPEAKER_35]: I was, I had, I received recently a death wish.

1824
02:57:59,144 --> 02:57:59,465
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

1825
02:58:00,538 --> 02:58:02,039
[SPEAKER_35]: Name and address for the record you have three minutes.

1826
02:58:02,719 --> 02:58:03,040
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

1827
02:58:03,160 --> 02:58:17,488
[SPEAKER_32]: My name is Josh Lee, I live at 347 Main Street, I obviously urge you to support this ordinance and to invest our public funds in ways that let us thrive and don't support destructive industries like weapons manufacturing prisons fossil fuels and the like.

1828
02:58:18,388 --> 02:58:30,574
[SPEAKER_32]: I just want to also say that disrespect of our time, our tax dollars and frankly like our collective humanity from Councilor Scarpelli is not lost on me, so the chair, or any of us, please direct the chair.

1829
02:58:31,134 --> 02:58:38,637
[SPEAKER_32]: We already invest our money in businesses that cause harm across the globe, we have already waded into global geopolitics by virtue of that investment.

1830
02:58:39,665 --> 02:58:49,533
[SPEAKER_32]: I volunteer my time, I am not funded, for the city as a member of its Energy and Environment Committee, which helps the city meet its goals set forth by the Climate Action and Adaptation Plan.

1831
02:58:49,894 --> 02:58:58,281
[SPEAKER_32]: That plan says, quote, climate change is rooted in a system of economic growth that extracts value without accounting for the real environmental and social costs.

1832
02:58:58,881 --> 02:59:06,748
[SPEAKER_32]: This is a good ordinance, and I am proud that it recognizes the multiplicity of the social costs involved in all of these industries, not just from fossil fuels.

1833
02:59:07,228 --> 02:59:15,571
[SPEAKER_32]: That being said, divestment from fossil fuels is an essential aspect of this ordinance and of our jobs as environmental advocates here to encourage.

1834
02:59:16,091 --> 02:59:19,872
[SPEAKER_32]: We currently have funds that are invested in the world's largest corporate polluter in Chevron.

1835
02:59:20,473 --> 02:59:27,455
[SPEAKER_32]: They have contributed over 40 billion tons of carbon into the atmosphere and will continue to do so as long as it is funded by funds like Medford's.

1836
02:59:28,680 --> 02:59:37,848
[SPEAKER_32]: I also want to note that this ordinance, as was noted several times, is specifically designed to not affect a much larger pool of investment dollars, the retirement fund of our public employees.

1837
02:59:37,868 --> 02:59:39,049
[SPEAKER_35]: Guys, let's not take the bait.

1838
02:59:39,109 --> 02:59:40,910
[SPEAKER_32]: Let's not have disputes in the hall.

1839
02:59:40,950 --> 02:59:42,171
[SPEAKER_32]: Please, let's just keep this civil.

1840
02:59:43,239 --> 03:00:05,688
[SPEAKER_32]: I myself am a municipal employee in our neighboring city of Somerville where over a decade ago, we as municipal employees voted to divest our retirement funds from fossil fuels that divestment has not yet happened over a decade later and is not able to happen due to conservative policy from the public employee of return retirement administration commission or para I urge you all to collaborate with the retirement board

1841
03:00:06,112 --> 03:00:20,522
[SPEAKER_32]: with Senator Jalen, with our representatives at the State House to give the freedom that this is proposing here, to give the agency and freedom to our public employees to divest their retirement funds from similarly destructive industries.

1842
03:00:20,542 --> 03:00:23,224
[SPEAKER_32]: So thank you, and I appreciate you voting for this.

1843
03:00:27,867 --> 03:00:30,529
[SPEAKER_33]: Before we continue, I'm gonna go to Vice President Collins.

1844
03:00:33,750 --> 03:00:35,895
[SPEAKER_24]: You know, President Bears, I'm going to wait until the end of public participation.

1845
03:00:36,175 --> 03:00:36,456
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1846
03:00:37,017 --> 03:00:37,398
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

1847
03:00:37,458 --> 03:00:38,841
[SPEAKER_35]: We'll continue with public participation.

1848
03:00:38,861 --> 03:00:40,044
[SPEAKER_35]: There's no hands on Zoom.

1849
03:00:40,926 --> 03:00:42,108
[SPEAKER_35]: So we'll continue at the podium.

1850
03:00:42,128 --> 03:00:43,090
[SPEAKER_35]: Name and address for the record, please.

1851
03:00:43,110 --> 03:00:43,672
[SPEAKER_35]: You have three minutes.

1852
03:00:44,108 --> 03:00:45,730
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, my name is Dina Alami.

1853
03:00:45,750 --> 03:00:48,272
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm at 3780 Mystic Valley Parkway.

1854
03:00:48,292 --> 03:00:51,655
[SPEAKER_10]: And I want to thank President Bears for bringing this ordinance forward.

1855
03:00:52,936 --> 03:01:07,270
[SPEAKER_10]: I was hoping to be here tonight to urge you all to vote in favor of this ordinance, not only because of the overwhelming moral and humanitarian reasons, but because as a Medford resident with family in Gaza, this issue is deeply personal to me.

1856
03:01:08,614 --> 03:01:25,222
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's be clear Medford currently has a 12 million currently has $12 million invested in accounts that include Lockheed Martin, the world's largest weapons manufacturer, the same company whose weapons have been used in clear violations of international human rights law.

1857
03:01:26,062 --> 03:01:32,186
[SPEAKER_10]: Lockheed Martin supplies Israel with fighter jets, which they have been using extensively to bomb Gaza.

1858
03:01:33,307 --> 03:01:35,949
[SPEAKER_10]: Those weapons have torn through my own family's life.

1859
03:01:36,789 --> 03:01:39,992
[SPEAKER_10]: I will give you a glimpse of how these weapons have affected my family.

1860
03:01:41,072 --> 03:01:48,518
[SPEAKER_10]: My pregnant cousin, Sahar, and her entire family were killed in a direct Israeli airstrike on their home.

1861
03:01:49,559 --> 03:01:59,902
[SPEAKER_10]: My cousin, seven-year-old daughter, Iman, was shot by an Israeli sniper while peeking out of her window and bled to death due to there being no safe passage to a hospital.

1862
03:02:00,842 --> 03:02:11,965
[SPEAKER_10]: My cousin's father, himself a doctor, was forced to amputate his own daughter's leg on their kitchen table after their home was struck by an Israeli bomb.

1863
03:02:13,706 --> 03:02:18,267
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the impact of these weapons being used to target and destroy hospitals

1864
03:02:20,292 --> 03:02:23,293
[SPEAKER_10]: And Israel has bombed all 36 hospitals in Gaza.

1865
03:02:24,193 --> 03:02:32,515
[SPEAKER_10]: My uncle has suffered multiple strokes and is not even taking a fourth of the medication needed to treat him due to the lack of access to proper health care.

1866
03:02:33,555 --> 03:02:36,796
[SPEAKER_10]: Every single one of my relatives has lost their home.

1867
03:02:37,476 --> 03:02:38,697
[SPEAKER_10]: One uncle displaced 17 times.

1868
03:02:40,600 --> 03:02:42,301
[SPEAKER_10]: This is not some distant conflict.

1869
03:02:42,581 --> 03:02:47,683
[SPEAKER_10]: This is what our country, sorry, our money, our tax dollars is funding.

1870
03:02:48,543 --> 03:02:57,506
[SPEAKER_10]: We all have a responsibility to say enough, enough violence, enough complicity, enough pretending this isn't our problem.

1871
03:02:58,226 --> 03:03:01,448
[SPEAKER_10]: Local governments do have a role in upholding human rights.

1872
03:03:01,648 --> 03:03:07,610
[SPEAKER_10]: And tonight, we did, you did have the power and the obligation to act.

1873
03:03:09,788 --> 03:03:13,751
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a meaningful step towards aligning our city's investments with our values.

1874
03:03:14,512 --> 03:03:21,938
[SPEAKER_10]: And I, too, would really prefer that my tax dollars went to fixing our potholes instead of bombing my family members.

1875
03:03:22,538 --> 03:03:22,879
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1876
03:03:22,899 --> 03:03:32,166
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you.

1877
03:03:32,246 --> 03:03:33,627
[SPEAKER_33]: We'll continue at the podium.

1878
03:03:33,827 --> 03:03:35,128
[SPEAKER_33]: Name and address for the record, please.

1879
03:03:35,168 --> 03:03:35,989
[SPEAKER_33]: You'll have three minutes.

1880
03:03:39,797 --> 03:03:40,778
[SPEAKER_16]: My name is Micah Kesselman.

1881
03:03:41,578 --> 03:03:43,079
[SPEAKER_16]: I live at 499 Main Street.

1882
03:03:44,079 --> 03:03:58,207
[SPEAKER_16]: I am going to make this comment not on behalf of myself, but on behalf of the New England Jewish Labor Bund, who fully support this going into effect.

1883
03:03:59,148 --> 03:04:08,473
[SPEAKER_16]: And then I will make a loop and make a small comment on my own behalf to respond to some of the issues that have come up.

1884
03:04:09,540 --> 03:04:17,526
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyway, I'm a resident of Medford for the better part of a decade now, and a member of the New England Jewish Labor Bund.

1885
03:04:17,546 --> 03:04:26,352
[SPEAKER_16]: I offer the following public statement in the context of both as a resident of our city and also as the stance of the New England Jewish Labor Bund on the topic of this ethical investment ordinance.

1886
03:04:27,793 --> 03:04:44,086
[SPEAKER_16]: This ordinance is directly aligned with two fundamental ethos of the book, the way kite and said the way kite translates to hereness and as a sort of concept of intentional presence, our home is where we are and is also not in a vacuum, our home should reflect the values we espouse and execute on.

1887
03:04:44,662 --> 03:04:59,849
[SPEAKER_16]: And it should operationalize these values internally and externally, because at the end of the day, Doikai is about the here and now, and also the there and then, where evil and injustice, cruelty and apathy, terror and misery are being performed upon one of our siblings and friends in humanity.

1888
03:05:00,469 --> 03:05:03,690
[SPEAKER_16]: They are being performed upon each and every one of us everywhere.

1889
03:05:04,511 --> 03:05:08,893
[SPEAKER_16]: Tzedek is another easily said word, but hard to define concept in actuality.

1890
03:05:09,808 --> 03:05:14,835
[SPEAKER_16]: There is a Klezmer Bundist song of Palestinian solidarity called Dumai that sings the demand,

1891
03:05:17,881 --> 03:05:21,742
[SPEAKER_16]: On the one hand, this translates to the popular slogan, without justice, without peace.

1892
03:05:22,342 --> 03:05:26,743
[SPEAKER_16]: But with a very slightly different pronunciation, on the other hand, refers to the root, tzedek.

1893
03:05:27,403 --> 03:05:28,964
[SPEAKER_16]: This is a deeply complex Hebrew root.

1894
03:05:29,384 --> 03:05:33,925
[SPEAKER_16]: Out of tzedek arises tzedek for justice, tzedakah for charity, tzedek for enlightened person.

1895
03:05:34,385 --> 03:05:39,586
[SPEAKER_16]: Tzedek is the gravitational center of justice, wisdom, mercy, compassion, righteousness, virtue.

1896
03:05:40,126 --> 03:05:47,268
[SPEAKER_16]: The greatest rabbis, all diaspora, placed tzedek and its formulations as the cornerstone mitzvah of all others.

1897
03:05:48,248 --> 03:05:58,637
[SPEAKER_16]: People should act first and foremost out of a basis of justice, compassion, mercy, care, and a community tethered to no other axiom would nevertheless emerge a just and good community.

1898
03:05:59,358 --> 03:06:03,981
[SPEAKER_16]: Moreover, civic across its range of formulations is necessary for peace anywhere.

1899
03:06:04,001 --> 03:06:08,165
[SPEAKER_16]: And a lack of peace somewhere must be treated as a lack of peace everywhere.

1900
03:06:08,725 --> 03:06:12,749
[SPEAKER_16]: This is not just a peace abroad and lands and among people suffering the clear yoke of oppression.

1901
03:06:13,424 --> 03:06:38,451
[SPEAKER_16]: There's also a question of peace here in our city, state, and country, where carceral profiteers leverage bigotry and terror to the terrible benefit of capital, where those with the most continue to deplete and ravage the habitability of our world simply to accumulate yet more than they could ever utilize in 100, 100 lifetimes, where the most successful and profitable companies are enterprises of murder, destruction, and misery, rather than building up the world around them.

1902
03:06:39,485 --> 03:06:47,634
[SPEAKER_16]: However, we are under no delusion that we can simply go and bring relief to the oppressed and justice to the oppressors with a social media post pithy statement and snap of our fingers.

1903
03:06:48,055 --> 03:06:48,375
[SPEAKER_35]: Micah.

1904
03:06:48,616 --> 03:06:49,176
[SPEAKER_16]: So often.

1905
03:06:49,196 --> 03:06:52,881
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm just going to have to ask you to hold off and come back around.

1906
03:06:53,421 --> 03:06:55,103
[SPEAKER_16]: There's like one, like half a paragraph.

1907
03:06:55,824 --> 03:06:57,105
[SPEAKER_16]: Two sentences and then we'll finish.

1908
03:06:57,145 --> 03:06:57,426
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1909
03:06:59,222 --> 03:07:14,013
[SPEAKER_16]: So often the demons we seek to banish are systemic and entrenched and this is a rare opportunity for a community to live up to and put into practice values of civic and dweikite just a little and through the labyrinthine mechanisms afforded to the many of us without direct and unbridled grip upon the levers of government control.

1910
03:07:14,613 --> 03:07:19,837
[SPEAKER_16]: We, the New England Jewish Labor Bund and myself, Micha Sholom Kesselman, who calls this city home,

1911
03:07:20,357 --> 03:07:30,885
[SPEAKER_16]: ask that this council and city make the decision to refuse allocations of our financial assets to forces of destruction, cruelty, oppression, and the reification of the darkest impulses of the human heart.

1912
03:07:31,406 --> 03:07:32,267
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1913
03:07:32,567 --> 03:07:38,672
[SPEAKER_35]: Seeing no hands on zoom, we'll continue at the podium.

1914
03:07:38,812 --> 03:07:41,174
[SPEAKER_35]: Name and address for the record and you'll have three minutes.

1915
03:07:43,525 --> 03:07:44,005
[SPEAKER_45]: Good evening.

1916
03:07:46,927 --> 03:07:48,367
[SPEAKER_45]: I live in three summit road.

1917
03:07:49,048 --> 03:07:51,369
[SPEAKER_45]: I'm testifying in support of the ordinance.

1918
03:07:52,409 --> 03:07:56,651
[SPEAKER_45]: I was born in Lebanon, and I hold a PhD in physics from Tufts University.

1919
03:07:57,552 --> 03:08:01,374
[SPEAKER_45]: I immigrated to Bedford in the 70s while Israel was bombing Lebanon.

1920
03:08:02,114 --> 03:08:08,057
[SPEAKER_45]: By now I have lived half my life in Bedford, a city which I love for its diversity and community.

1921
03:08:08,811 --> 03:08:14,072
[SPEAKER_45]: I do not want my chosen home to invest in companies which profit from weapons of mass destruction.

1922
03:08:15,012 --> 03:08:17,693
[SPEAKER_45]: My first understanding of Israel's violence was in 1958.

1923
03:08:17,813 --> 03:08:24,514
[SPEAKER_45]: In our living room, the village elders met to decide whether we should leave the village in fear of a civil war.

1924
03:08:25,994 --> 03:08:27,995
[SPEAKER_45]: An eight-year-old, I listened eagerly.

1925
03:08:28,595 --> 03:08:34,876
[SPEAKER_45]: Camille Chamon, the pro-Israel president of Lebanon, wanted to extend an illegal third term

1926
03:08:35,377 --> 03:08:48,934
[SPEAKER_45]: and asked President Eisenhower to help to defuse the opposition claiming they were coming in the room was my husband when your father and other Christian Palestinian families who fled Palestine at 48 and settled in our village.

1927
03:08:49,767 --> 03:08:57,869
[SPEAKER_45]: I still remember Munir's father refusing to leave the village, fearing he may never be able to come back to his home, just as he was forced out of Palestine.

1928
03:08:58,749 --> 03:09:17,573
[SPEAKER_45]: This memory of Palestinian determination stuck with me, even as Munir and I were later forced to flee Lebanon, first to Baghdad and then to Medford as young physics professors in the late 70s, as US and Israel stopped a sectarian civil war and attempted to eliminate the Palestinian national movement.

1929
03:09:18,870 --> 03:09:23,895
[SPEAKER_45]: In 1982, the Israeli army invaded Lebanon with the pretext of eliminating the PLO.

1930
03:09:24,536 --> 03:09:30,982
[SPEAKER_45]: Within four days, the Israelis marched into my village, halfway into Lebanon, very far from where the PLO were.

1931
03:09:31,122 --> 03:09:32,303
[SPEAKER_45]: They destroyed our village.

1932
03:09:32,823 --> 03:09:37,808
[SPEAKER_45]: 18 rockets fell in our house alone, just as we saw in Gaza and now Iran.

1933
03:09:37,888 --> 03:09:41,271
[SPEAKER_45]: People fleeing, taking little more than the clothes on their backs.

1934
03:09:42,132 --> 03:09:44,714
[SPEAKER_45]: My brothers scattered to different parts of the world.

1935
03:09:45,555 --> 03:09:47,657
[SPEAKER_45]: My uncle died during an Israeli bombing.

1936
03:09:48,017 --> 03:09:48,878
[SPEAKER_45]: My parents fled.

1937
03:09:48,978 --> 03:09:50,600
[SPEAKER_45]: My mother never saw her home again.

1938
03:09:50,920 --> 03:09:52,301
[SPEAKER_45]: My mother-in-law died alone.

1939
03:09:52,701 --> 03:09:56,445
[SPEAKER_45]: For months, we did not know whether members of our family were alive or dead.

1940
03:09:57,446 --> 03:10:20,911
[SPEAKER_45]: Today, even while the Israeli military burns entire families in their tents and targets starving civilians seeking aid in Gaza, Israel continues to bomb South Lebanon, displacing 1.4 million people out of 4.5 million people, killing children, parents, and grandparents, scorching the 1,000-year-old olive trees with illegal white phosphorus made in Alabama.

1941
03:10:21,711 --> 03:10:25,792
[SPEAKER_45]: Israel's F-35 fighter jets are also made by Lockheed Martin.

1942
03:10:26,852 --> 03:10:38,280
[SPEAKER_45]: Chevron is extracting the gas fields of the shore of Gaza that belongs to Palestine, to Gaza, while Israel steals Gaza's resources and starves and genocides an entire people.

1943
03:10:39,161 --> 03:10:42,423
[SPEAKER_45]: Our city of Medford invests in Lockheed Martin and Chevron.

1944
03:10:43,243 --> 03:10:45,525
[SPEAKER_45]: Our city should not invest in war and devastation.

1945
03:10:45,685 --> 03:10:49,648
[SPEAKER_45]: Medford needs to invest in a sustainable future for our children and grandchildren.

1946
03:10:50,268 --> 03:10:50,508
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

1947
03:10:50,528 --> 03:10:51,809
[SPEAKER_45]: I urge you to vote in support.

1948
03:10:52,110 --> 03:10:52,470
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

1949
03:10:58,588 --> 03:11:00,250
[SPEAKER_35]: No hands on zoom, we'll stay at the podium.

1950
03:11:00,290 --> 03:11:01,411
[SPEAKER_35]: Name and address for the record, please.

1951
03:11:01,431 --> 03:11:02,132
[SPEAKER_35]: You have three minutes.

1952
03:11:02,692 --> 03:11:04,494
[SPEAKER_04]: Cassandra Diaba, 32 Walnut.

1953
03:11:05,756 --> 03:11:09,259
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to thank President Bears for bringing this item to the table.

1954
03:11:10,360 --> 03:11:16,166
[SPEAKER_04]: I had written a lot about climate change, but I really just want to speak right now as a Jewish resident of Medford.

1955
03:11:16,446 --> 03:11:20,470
[SPEAKER_04]: My great grandparents were actually part of the labor wound in Lodz, Poland.

1956
03:11:22,172 --> 03:11:27,896
[SPEAKER_04]: But as a Jewish resident of Medford, I don't want my tax dollars enriching reference manufacturers.

1957
03:11:28,096 --> 03:11:36,503
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want companies that are profiting off the genocide that Israel claims isn't happening and is perpetuating in my name without my consent.

1958
03:11:37,984 --> 03:11:42,868
[SPEAKER_04]: Our city has already passed a resolution in favor of a ceasefire in Gaza, which I

1959
03:11:43,608 --> 03:11:54,880
[SPEAKER_04]: also support and I really hope that the council can see that there are a variety of Jewish voices on this issue and some of us are very much in favor of this resolution.

1960
03:11:55,601 --> 03:11:56,341
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for your time.

1961
03:11:59,565 --> 03:12:00,165
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you.

1962
03:12:01,307 --> 03:12:02,508
[SPEAKER_33]: We'll stay at the podium.

1963
03:12:02,608 --> 03:12:04,170
[SPEAKER_35]: Name and address for the record please.

1964
03:12:04,930 --> 03:12:07,232
[SPEAKER_38]: Hello, Takao Rivera, 75 4th Street.

1965
03:12:08,333 --> 03:12:14,218
[SPEAKER_38]: I'd like to thank President Bears for bringing the Local Investments Ordinance to this agenda today and for the opportunity to speak.

1966
03:12:15,659 --> 03:12:24,267
[SPEAKER_38]: I urge you all to support the Local Investments Ordinance from my standpoint, not only as an educator, as a concerned member of the community, but as a father.

1967
03:12:25,811 --> 03:12:35,799
[SPEAKER_38]: My wife and I moved here to Medford three years ago for our young son when he was just a baby, because we believed that this town would be a supportive and nurturing environment to raise a family.

1968
03:12:37,060 --> 03:12:38,181
[SPEAKER_38]: And I do believe that's true.

1969
03:12:39,502 --> 03:12:53,694
[SPEAKER_38]: We walk down the street in the strollers, kids clamoring to get ice cream at Colleen's, playing dress-up at the public library's fairy ball, story time in Medford Family Network, dancing along to the live music at the farmer's market on the Mystic River.

1970
03:12:55,376 --> 03:13:00,639
[SPEAKER_38]: This is a town where children thrive, where my son thrives.

1971
03:13:02,661 --> 03:13:06,643
[SPEAKER_38]: But over these years, we've seen catastrophe around the world intensify.

1972
03:13:07,984 --> 03:13:13,107
[SPEAKER_38]: When I see children maimed, slaughtered, orphaned in Gaza, I see my son.

1973
03:13:14,809 --> 03:13:21,533
[SPEAKER_38]: When I see young children incarcerated, rounded up, deported, children with Spanish surnames like mine, I see my son.

1974
03:13:22,994 --> 03:13:32,422
[SPEAKER_38]: When I see entire populations displaced, drowned, scorched, dispossessed by the climate change brought on by the fossil fuel industry, I see the looming future of my son.

1975
03:13:34,383 --> 03:13:41,769
[SPEAKER_38]: We live in an era of unprecedented communication that enables us to see apocalypses in the palms of our hands as we rock our infants to sleep.

1976
03:13:42,069 --> 03:13:50,176
[SPEAKER_38]: And we smile for them, let their little hands grip our fingers and let them know that everything is gonna be all okay when all indications vote otherwise.

1977
03:13:51,803 --> 03:13:57,189
[SPEAKER_38]: while soldiers write messages to Palestinian children on the Lockheed Martin missiles we're launching to them.

1978
03:13:58,731 --> 03:14:11,486
[SPEAKER_38]: While ICE continues to prowl our communities, stealing our neighbors and our students, while an entire carceral system deploys legal slavery in its Jim Crow 2.0 cheap labor, and here's the thing,

1979
03:14:13,902 --> 03:14:27,705
[SPEAKER_38]: As long as Medford continues to invest in fossil fuels, prisons, and weapons utilized in the ongoing genocide, then my tax dollars, all our tax dollars, are contributing to the incarceration, strangulation, and death of children who are not unlike mine.

1980
03:14:29,485 --> 03:14:34,426
[SPEAKER_38]: I am tired of raising a child while the taxes I pay kills another.

1981
03:14:36,246 --> 03:14:40,747
[SPEAKER_38]: We have the luxury to wait because it's not bombs over our heads.

1982
03:14:42,225 --> 03:14:45,987
[SPEAKER_38]: This is a city for families, for children.

1983
03:14:46,387 --> 03:14:48,088
[SPEAKER_38]: Let our investments reflect that.

1984
03:14:48,509 --> 03:14:49,629
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you so much for your vision.

1985
03:14:52,291 --> 03:14:52,831
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you.

1986
03:14:52,891 --> 03:14:56,053
[SPEAKER_33]: We'll stay at the podium.

1987
03:14:56,213 --> 03:14:57,194
[SPEAKER_33]: Name and address for the record, please.

1988
03:14:57,214 --> 03:14:58,054
[SPEAKER_33]: You have three minutes.

1989
03:14:59,555 --> 03:15:00,936
[SPEAKER_27]: My name is Will Sherwood.

1990
03:15:01,016 --> 03:15:03,257
[SPEAKER_27]: I live in 30 Woodside Road.

1991
03:15:03,277 --> 03:15:04,998
[SPEAKER_27]: I am a Medford resident.

1992
03:15:05,718 --> 03:15:12,002
[SPEAKER_27]: I am the chair of the Medford Energy and Environment Committee, and I'm a teacher that specializes in environmental education.

1993
03:15:13,167 --> 03:15:15,169
[SPEAKER_27]: And I'm in favor of divestment.

1994
03:15:15,989 --> 03:15:18,572
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm not here to speak on behalf of the Energy and Environment Committee.

1995
03:15:18,792 --> 03:15:22,535
[SPEAKER_27]: All of you received our email of unanimous support for this endeavor.

1996
03:15:23,756 --> 03:15:26,718
[SPEAKER_27]: Instead, I'm here to speak on behalf of my students.

1997
03:15:27,439 --> 03:15:28,800
[SPEAKER_27]: My students are aged eight to 12.

1998
03:15:28,920 --> 03:15:32,003
[SPEAKER_27]: We go up for the walks in the fells every day.

1999
03:15:33,559 --> 03:15:43,084
[SPEAKER_27]: These are the ones that I see every day frustrated and scared by severe weather that they see on the news, by the terrifying things that happen every day that they cannot control.

2000
03:15:44,185 --> 03:15:54,270
[SPEAKER_27]: These students cry and worry over heat waves like today, wildfire smoke from previous summers, the loss of wildflowers, wild birds, and insects.

2001
03:15:55,071 --> 03:15:58,713
[SPEAKER_27]: What they are feeling is frustration, is fear, it is sadness, it is grief.

2002
03:15:59,433 --> 03:16:03,035
[SPEAKER_27]: It is grief over a world they do not get a say in saving.

2003
03:16:04,497 --> 03:16:16,468
[SPEAKER_27]: We as adults, as parents, as educators, as voters, and as politicians have an obligation to our future generations to build something sustainable, to build something healthy, to build something kind.

2004
03:16:17,589 --> 03:16:26,938
[SPEAKER_27]: By investing our city funds in groups like Chevron and Lockheed Martin, which are destabilizing companies, we are betraying the trust that our students and our children have placed in us.

2005
03:16:27,987 --> 03:16:35,633
[SPEAKER_27]: There is absolutely no excuse to be funding these industries that explicitly and knowingly destabilize and destroy our planet.

2006
03:16:36,294 --> 03:16:39,916
[SPEAKER_27]: To do so is out of line with our stated climate action plan.

2007
03:16:40,577 --> 03:16:43,379
[SPEAKER_27]: Things that we've agreed to as a community is important to us.

2008
03:16:44,220 --> 03:16:47,883
[SPEAKER_27]: It runs directly counter to a sustainable and healthy world.

2009
03:16:48,977 --> 03:16:58,805
[SPEAKER_27]: By divesting from these industries, we are protecting not just our homes and our health, we are creating a future that benefits and safeguards Medford residents who will live here long after us.

2010
03:17:00,025 --> 03:17:10,794
[SPEAKER_27]: I strongly urge you, although you are deciding not to vote today, to be brave, to be bold, and to be kind, and vote in favor of divesting from these harmful companies.

2011
03:17:11,534 --> 03:17:11,934
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you so much.

2012
03:17:17,982 --> 03:17:18,482
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

2013
03:17:18,502 --> 03:17:19,883
[SPEAKER_35]: We'll stay at the podium.

2014
03:17:20,083 --> 03:17:21,404
[SPEAKER_35]: Name and address for the record, please.

2015
03:17:21,444 --> 03:17:22,265
[SPEAKER_35]: You have three minutes.

2016
03:17:25,027 --> 03:17:25,347
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

2017
03:17:25,607 --> 03:17:27,849
[SPEAKER_47]: Benjamin Chime, 76 Marion Street.

2018
03:17:29,250 --> 03:17:35,775
[SPEAKER_47]: Yeah, I'm speaking in favor of bringing forth this ordinance, hoping we can vote on this very soon.

2019
03:17:36,215 --> 03:17:44,841
[SPEAKER_47]: In February of last year, this council voted in favor of a resolution calling for a ceasefire in Gaza, asking the government to use its full power to bring about an end to the war.

2020
03:17:45,161 --> 03:17:46,182
[SPEAKER_47]: It also mentioned, quote,

2021
03:17:47,097 --> 03:17:51,280
[SPEAKER_47]: the inalienable right of all people to live in peace, free from fear of harm and prejudice.

2022
03:17:52,780 --> 03:17:58,244
[SPEAKER_47]: It's now one and a half years later after that resolution, 20 months after the war started, there's still no ceasefire.

2023
03:17:59,104 --> 03:18:02,646
[SPEAKER_47]: And the more than 2 million Palestinians in Gaza have not lived in peace for a single day since then.

2024
03:18:03,887 --> 03:18:11,692
[SPEAKER_47]: It's painful to realize that somehow we are able as a society to carry on with life where people are killed and starved every single day.

2025
03:18:12,939 --> 03:18:24,972
[SPEAKER_47]: And it's even more painful to look at that and understand that the only reason for this genocide, that this genocide has been allowed to continue for so long, is the unconditional support of this government.

2026
03:18:25,973 --> 03:18:32,020
[SPEAKER_47]: Both the previous and the current administration for Israel's war through the endless supply of weapons, political support, money.

2027
03:18:33,634 --> 03:18:45,023
[SPEAKER_47]: A lot of these weapons that are used to kill civilians are made here by American companies like Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, produced in our backyards in Massachusetts and across the country, designed by researchers in places like MIT.

2028
03:18:46,505 --> 03:19:00,196
[SPEAKER_47]: And I think it's important to realize how life here and death in Gaza are connected, how our tax dollars finance this genocide, how our pension funds benefit from the profit companies make by destroying other people's lives.

2029
03:19:01,850 --> 03:19:06,373
[SPEAKER_47]: Divestment is one small but concrete and material step to resist the cycle.

2030
03:19:07,394 --> 03:19:16,841
[SPEAKER_47]: The city of Medford doesn't have a lot of money in investments accounts, and I think in the large scale of things, not significant amounts of money in general.

2031
03:19:19,443 --> 03:19:23,827
[SPEAKER_47]: And even if we divest Lockheed Martin, we'll probably not even notice the change.

2032
03:19:24,918 --> 03:19:28,000
[SPEAKER_47]: But it is one weird step, and it is one drop in the bucket.

2033
03:19:28,440 --> 03:19:34,664
[SPEAKER_47]: And if more and more cities and states and other institutions follow our steps, that will bring down the war industry eventually.

2034
03:19:35,544 --> 03:19:37,986
[SPEAKER_47]: Because all these companies care about is money, nothing else.

2035
03:19:38,967 --> 03:19:43,249
[SPEAKER_47]: And to some of the earlier comments, I'm sure it's complex.

2036
03:19:43,289 --> 03:19:44,450
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm sure there's legal concerns.

2037
03:19:44,470 --> 03:19:47,192
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm sure there's questions like, who makes these calls?

2038
03:19:47,492 --> 03:19:48,893
[SPEAKER_47]: What companies to divest from?

2039
03:19:49,880 --> 03:19:52,862
[SPEAKER_47]: But I think it's really the least we can do with this urgency.

2040
03:19:53,082 --> 03:20:01,967
[SPEAKER_47]: And I would encourage city staff and Councilors who have questions on this to really prioritize and think what we can do as little as it is to stop this genocide.

2041
03:20:02,607 --> 03:20:03,208
[SPEAKER_47]: So thank you.

2042
03:20:04,348 --> 03:20:04,788
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you.

2043
03:20:04,808 --> 03:20:10,732
[SPEAKER_22]: We'll stay at the podium.

2044
03:20:10,752 --> 03:20:12,033
[SPEAKER_22]: Name and address for the record, please.

2045
03:20:13,493 --> 03:20:15,875
[SPEAKER_22]: Hello, Evan Bell, 200 Winthrop Street.

2046
03:20:16,873 --> 03:20:18,414
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm here to speak in support of this ordinance.

2047
03:20:18,654 --> 03:20:20,935
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm here to talk mostly about fossil fuel divestment.

2048
03:20:21,455 --> 03:20:29,398
[SPEAKER_22]: These are campaigns that I've been a part of since 2012 when I was a student at Tufts, also as a resident, talking about the state funds.

2049
03:20:31,139 --> 03:20:32,499
[SPEAKER_22]: Those have not been super successful.

2050
03:20:32,519 --> 03:20:33,740
[SPEAKER_22]: This is a hard campaign.

2051
03:20:33,760 --> 03:20:36,141
[SPEAKER_22]: It requires a lot of work, but it is important.

2052
03:20:36,161 --> 03:20:40,923
[SPEAKER_22]: It remains a key tactic of the climate justice movement for over a decade now.

2053
03:20:41,663 --> 03:20:56,737
[SPEAKER_22]: Because there have been notable victories like New York State, the Ford Foundation, Harvard University, and many more cities, businesses, universities, it continues to be an important tactic because it reminds us to invest in the world we want to see, not a world of pollution and violence.

2054
03:20:57,562 --> 03:21:01,406
[SPEAKER_22]: We experienced climate change here in Medford and we suffer real heat waves like today.

2055
03:21:01,426 --> 03:21:13,337
[SPEAKER_22]: We also see it with worsening weather events and droughts in Massachusetts we've seen climate change wash away crops we've seen sea level rise impact our neighboring coastal communities.

2056
03:21:14,268 --> 03:21:23,639
[SPEAKER_22]: And those who have been impacted first and worst are the environmental justice communities and our neighbors, our friends who are incarcerated is an important one for today.

2057
03:21:24,200 --> 03:21:29,165
[SPEAKER_22]: These are people who have the greatest exposure to heat and the least ability to affect their environment.

2058
03:21:30,467 --> 03:21:32,870
[SPEAKER_22]: Climate change is an injustice exacerbator.

2059
03:21:33,799 --> 03:21:42,381
[SPEAKER_22]: It drives immigration as refugees flee their homes when they are no longer safe, when there are no options to work, the cost of living, of eating and getting around is too much.

2060
03:21:43,042 --> 03:21:48,223
[SPEAKER_22]: It impacts all injustice, sometimes literally lighting the fire under already stressed communities.

2061
03:21:49,203 --> 03:21:54,525
[SPEAKER_22]: I support this ordinance because we actively choose the world we want to live in as we choose to invest our money.

2062
03:21:55,463 --> 03:22:04,067
[SPEAKER_22]: We can continue to choose to invest in war, genocide, and fossil fuels and make it all worse, or we can choose to divest and invest instead in a better world.

2063
03:22:04,327 --> 03:22:04,627
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

2064
03:22:06,608 --> 03:22:06,929
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you.

2065
03:22:07,389 --> 03:22:12,611
[SPEAKER_33]: Name and address for record, you have three minutes.

2066
03:22:13,772 --> 03:22:15,913
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, my name is Owen, I live in South Medford.

2067
03:22:16,353 --> 03:22:22,056
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, President Bears for bringing this to the agenda and members of the city council for giving us this opportunity to speak.

2068
03:22:23,684 --> 03:22:30,691
[SPEAKER_05]: I support item 25105 and I urge you to move it forward speedily even though you have chosen not to vote tonight.

2069
03:22:31,451 --> 03:22:37,637
[SPEAKER_05]: Medford should divest our tax dollars from corporations that are causing grave harm to human rights and the environment.

2070
03:22:38,178 --> 03:22:48,907
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm devastated by the genocide Israel has been perpetrating in Gaza and the fact that my Medford tax dollars are supporting weapons companies, enabling and profiting from this genocide.

2071
03:22:49,628 --> 03:22:53,971
[SPEAKER_05]: Last year, Medford City Council passed an important resolution in favor of a ceasefire in Gaza.

2072
03:22:54,311 --> 03:23:01,797
[SPEAKER_05]: We must back that ceasefire resolution with concrete action to divest from the weapons companies profiting from the ongoing genocide.

2073
03:23:03,010 --> 03:23:08,712
[SPEAKER_05]: I spoke today with a friend of mine who lives in Massachusetts who grew up in Gaza and still has the majority of his family living there.

2074
03:23:08,872 --> 03:23:12,073
[SPEAKER_05]: His parents, his three brothers, four sisters all live in Gaza.

2075
03:23:12,593 --> 03:23:17,715
[SPEAKER_05]: The houses of all of his aunts and uncles in Gaza on his mother's side have been completely destroyed by bombing.

2076
03:23:18,055 --> 03:23:24,057
[SPEAKER_05]: He estimates that 95% of his family members in Gaza have had their homes destroyed by Israeli bombing.

2077
03:23:24,877 --> 03:23:31,323
[SPEAKER_05]: His parents' home in Gaza was destroyed in 2009 and then rebuilt by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency.

2078
03:23:31,723 --> 03:23:37,048
[SPEAKER_05]: That home now houses all of his displaced relatives from all over Gaza who have lost their homes since October 2023.

2079
03:23:38,429 --> 03:23:44,154
[SPEAKER_05]: My friend spoke of the unrelenting anxiety, fear, and displacement that his loved ones face in Gaza.

2080
03:23:44,654 --> 03:23:50,500
[SPEAKER_05]: This destruction and violence is funded by our Medford tax dollars being invested in companies like Lockheed Martin.

2081
03:23:51,120 --> 03:24:03,771
[SPEAKER_05]: According to tracking data from the American Friends Service Committee, Lockheed Martin is the world's largest weapons manufacturer and supplies Israel with F-16 and F-35 fighter jets, which Israel has been using to bomb Gaza.

2082
03:24:04,632 --> 03:24:13,880
[SPEAKER_05]: Israel also uses the company's C-130 Hercules transport planes to support the ground invasion of Gaza and manufactures AGM-114 Hellfire missiles

2083
03:24:14,460 --> 03:24:16,141
[SPEAKER_05]: for Israel's Apache helicopters.

2084
03:24:16,561 --> 03:24:25,365
[SPEAKER_05]: Medford should immediately divest from fossil fuels, detention and prisons, weapons companies, and companies perpetrating human rights abuses.

2085
03:24:25,905 --> 03:24:30,727
[SPEAKER_05]: Fossil fuel companies are responsible for pollution and climate change negatively affecting us all.

2086
03:24:31,428 --> 03:24:36,530
[SPEAKER_05]: Prison and detention corporations are profiting off of caging our neighbors and immigrant communities.

2087
03:24:37,632 --> 03:24:42,256
[SPEAKER_05]: Weapons companies are profiting from killing children and families and destroying homes and neighborhoods.

2088
03:24:42,696 --> 03:24:46,259
[SPEAKER_05]: Medford is a community that values human and environmental wellbeing.

2089
03:24:46,539 --> 03:24:49,341
[SPEAKER_05]: We must ensure that our investments align with these values.

2090
03:24:49,861 --> 03:24:52,944
[SPEAKER_05]: Please move forward item 25-105 speedily.

2091
03:24:53,084 --> 03:24:53,444
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

2092
03:24:53,965 --> 03:24:54,625
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you.

2093
03:24:59,769 --> 03:25:02,071
[SPEAKER_33]: Stay at the podium, name and address for the record please.

2094
03:25:02,992 --> 03:25:10,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. president got some fear 61 Stignero I oppose the so called values line local investments ordinance as written.

2095
03:25:11,737 --> 03:25:21,623
[SPEAKER_02]: I applaud the moral impulse behind aligning medford's investment with our values, yet good intentions must align with fiscal prudence and security.

2096
03:25:23,158 --> 03:25:33,366
[SPEAKER_02]: Section 2697C forces our treasurer to divest from any firm earning even $1 from national defense work.

2097
03:25:34,167 --> 03:25:41,352
[SPEAKER_02]: That sweeps in companies building weather satellites, cybersecurity tools, and body armor that protect our service members.

2098
03:25:42,373 --> 03:25:51,641
[SPEAKER_02]: A few lines later, section 2697E exempts the pension portfolio whenever divestment would harm risk-adjusted returns.

2099
03:25:52,487 --> 03:26:01,255
[SPEAKER_02]: The sponsors therefore seem to admit the policy will probably underperform, but they shield retirees while making ordinary taxpayers absorb the heat.

2100
03:26:02,136 --> 03:26:10,724
[SPEAKER_02]: If the screen violates fiduciary duty for pensioners, it violates the same duty to every resident who funds our streets, schools, and libraries.

2101
03:26:12,145 --> 03:26:14,327
[SPEAKER_02]: Strategically, the ban is reckless.

2102
03:26:15,015 --> 03:26:24,819
[SPEAKER_02]: Deterrence depends on an unrivaled military whose ships, jets, and humanitarian aid aircraft still run on high energy density fuels.

2103
03:26:25,800 --> 03:26:28,761
[SPEAKER_02]: Green hydrogen, the hope for substitute, is nascent.

2104
03:26:29,662 --> 03:26:34,624
[SPEAKER_02]: Only pilot plants of a few tons per day are online and costs are rising, not falling.

2105
03:26:36,013 --> 03:26:44,939
[SPEAKER_02]: Until scalable zero-carbon propulsion exists, divesting from firms that refine jet fuel or machine turbine blades does not advance peace or the climate.

2106
03:26:45,820 --> 03:26:50,363
[SPEAKER_02]: It merely cedes advantage to actors who do not share our values.

2107
03:26:51,524 --> 03:26:54,146
[SPEAKER_02]: Finally, defense equities diversify risk.

2108
03:26:54,686 --> 03:27:01,431
[SPEAKER_02]: They have low correlation with consumer sectors and often outperform during downturns, characteristics that stabilize city revenues.

2109
03:27:02,088 --> 03:27:04,229
[SPEAKER_02]: Selling them will not close a single factory.

2110
03:27:04,589 --> 03:27:06,570
[SPEAKER_02]: It will simply weaken our balance sheet.

2111
03:27:07,610 --> 03:27:08,991
[SPEAKER_02]: I urge you to vote no.

2112
03:27:09,011 --> 03:27:19,655
[SPEAKER_02]: Please commission an evidence-based study of realistic sustainability criteria instead of passing a measure that compromises both fiscal stewardship and national security.

2113
03:27:19,935 --> 03:27:20,455
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

2114
03:27:20,515 --> 03:27:21,235
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

2115
03:27:22,336 --> 03:27:22,956
[SPEAKER_35]: Stay at the podium.

2116
03:27:25,577 --> 03:27:26,898
[SPEAKER_35]: Stay at the podium, name and address for the record.

2117
03:27:26,918 --> 03:27:27,558
[SPEAKER_35]: You have three minutes.

2118
03:27:28,387 --> 03:27:30,388
[SPEAKER_28]: Hi, Sam Goldstein, 29 Martin Street.

2119
03:27:30,728 --> 03:27:35,951
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you for bringing this forward, councillors.

2120
03:27:35,991 --> 03:27:42,594
[SPEAKER_28]: It is hard not to notice that I believe the temperature got up to 104, 105 today.

2121
03:27:45,376 --> 03:27:57,322
[SPEAKER_28]: We're experiencing, in a very literal, immediate sense, the impacts of capitalism and the climate crisis.

2122
03:27:58,740 --> 03:28:04,802
[SPEAKER_28]: And, you know, I appreciate what this is, this ordinance is trying to do.

2123
03:28:05,702 --> 03:28:07,702
[SPEAKER_28]: And, you know, I think we'll do.

2124
03:28:10,183 --> 03:28:24,567
[SPEAKER_28]: I think an earlier speaker had noted, you know, all the potential impacts of, you know, this ordinance and was listing off a bit of a litany of different companies that have, you know, committed war crimes or crimes against humanity.

2125
03:28:26,045 --> 03:28:39,971
[SPEAKER_28]: You know, we've talked a lot about Lockheed Martin, but even companies as mundane as Chiquita, you know, I think a few months ago was found, I think, maybe in a civil proceeding to have been funding a right-wing death squad.

2126
03:28:40,472 --> 03:28:44,973
[SPEAKER_28]: And, you know, this is, I think, you know, the reality we live in.

2127
03:28:45,093 --> 03:28:51,116
[SPEAKER_28]: And, you know, I appreciate the aims of, you know, of what this is trying to do.

2128
03:28:55,060 --> 03:28:55,900
[SPEAKER_28]: I am Jewish.

2129
03:28:56,000 --> 03:29:07,124
[SPEAKER_28]: I do want to say I find the conflation of Jewish identity in the state of Israel, as has been noted by some previous speakers, to be offensive.

2130
03:29:09,125 --> 03:29:13,126
[SPEAKER_28]: It's not something I support, the conflation between.

2131
03:29:13,466 --> 03:29:23,870
[SPEAKER_28]: And certainly, I don't think that it's certainly not fair that the state of Israel has killed tens of thousands of people, many of them children.

2132
03:29:25,358 --> 03:29:49,109
[SPEAKER_28]: And I think that to frame, to not allow reproach for these massacres that are occurring at food aid distribution sites that have been going on in both very technologically sophisticated and also simple and brutal ways, I find

2133
03:29:49,809 --> 03:29:57,333
[SPEAKER_28]: You know, the timing of that conversation, you know disturbing because I think it doesn't allow us to, you know, examine.

2134
03:29:58,653 --> 03:30:05,277
[SPEAKER_28]: You know what's going on, which is at the end of the day just a grossly disproportionate death toll in a war between.

2135
03:30:06,177 --> 03:30:24,066
[SPEAKER_28]: a country that is armed to the teeth with the most sophisticated weapons technology in human history against people who have had their health care and just basic civilian life-sustaining infrastructure annihilated.

2136
03:30:25,587 --> 03:30:29,789
[SPEAKER_28]: So I think it's important that we check that and we recognize that as well.

2137
03:30:29,929 --> 03:30:30,249
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

2138
03:30:31,409 --> 03:30:31,750
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you.

2139
03:30:35,807 --> 03:30:37,529
[SPEAKER_33]: So at the podium, name and address for the record, please.

2140
03:30:37,549 --> 03:30:38,230
[SPEAKER_33]: You have three minutes.

2141
03:30:39,091 --> 03:30:40,893
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, I'm Debbie Schillkraut-Russell.

2142
03:30:40,953 --> 03:30:44,657
[SPEAKER_13]: I live on Woburn Street, and I'm actually speaking about a different topic.

2143
03:30:45,217 --> 03:30:54,627
[SPEAKER_13]: On Saturday morning, I just wanted in the record that on Saturday morning, several vehicles with ICE agents in them pulled someone over right in front of my house and detained them.

2144
03:30:55,668 --> 03:31:03,635
[SPEAKER_13]: We emailed you all about it, and I know Councilwoman Lazzaro was considering bringing it up later, but it's well past my bedtime.

2145
03:31:04,115 --> 03:31:16,685
[SPEAKER_13]: So I just wanted to have it on the record and have an opportunity to say that, you know, as much as I know about this issue on paper, when it's happening on your doorstep, it makes you realize, I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do right now.

2146
03:31:17,306 --> 03:31:19,808
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think it made me realize it would be very helpful

2147
03:31:21,012 --> 03:31:28,956
[SPEAKER_13]: Or at least I became very curious what our local elected officials want residents to do if we witness this happening on our doorsteps.

2148
03:31:29,156 --> 03:31:32,078
[SPEAKER_13]: What does local law enforcement want us to do?

2149
03:31:32,718 --> 03:31:33,879
[SPEAKER_13]: Should I call the police?

2150
03:31:33,959 --> 03:31:39,042
[SPEAKER_13]: You hear stories about people impersonating ICE agents because they're often not wearing uniforms.

2151
03:31:40,242 --> 03:31:44,463
[SPEAKER_13]: There was a feeling of kind of paralysis, of what are we supposed to do in this situation?

2152
03:31:44,483 --> 03:31:50,985
[SPEAKER_13]: I will say that my husband contacted Luce, I'm not sure if I'm pronouncing their name correctly, and they were exceptionally helpful.

2153
03:31:51,365 --> 03:31:55,246
[SPEAKER_13]: They were able to identify the person who was taken and notify his family.

2154
03:31:56,326 --> 03:32:01,968
[SPEAKER_13]: So if anyone else sees this happen, I would recommend contacting them, but I just think it made me realize

2155
03:32:03,149 --> 03:32:12,589
[SPEAKER_13]: hearing from our elected officials and from law enforcement of their perspectives on what they recommend citizens do when we see this happen would be helpful.

2156
03:32:12,849 --> 03:32:13,070
Thank you.

2157
03:32:14,483 --> 03:32:14,863
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

2158
03:32:15,524 --> 03:32:17,005
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm gonna just pause there.

2159
03:32:17,025 --> 03:32:19,928
[SPEAKER_35]: We do have a resolution under suspension to consider on that topic later.

2160
03:32:19,988 --> 03:32:21,550
[SPEAKER_35]: We've had several meetings on the topic.

2161
03:32:21,970 --> 03:32:26,935
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm gonna quickly go to Councilor Lazzaro since she was mentioned and thank you for being here.

2162
03:32:26,975 --> 03:32:32,780
[SPEAKER_35]: And I think we're all deeply disturbed by what's been happening in this community and our targeting by federal agents.

2163
03:32:34,001 --> 03:32:34,522
[SPEAKER_35]: Councilor Lazzaro.

2164
03:32:35,185 --> 03:32:35,665
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

2165
03:32:35,905 --> 03:32:38,946
[SPEAKER_25]: I appreciate the need to go to bed.

2166
03:32:38,966 --> 03:32:50,510
[SPEAKER_25]: I feel that also often I we Councilor, Vice President Collins and I do have a resolution under suspension, I would like to let this, this topic.

2167
03:32:51,590 --> 03:33:00,819
[SPEAKER_25]: finish before we discuss this, but I encourage anybody who does need to go home, this meeting will be, it's live streaming on YouTube right now.

2168
03:33:00,859 --> 03:33:04,002
[SPEAKER_25]: You'll be able to watch it after the fact.

2169
03:33:05,083 --> 03:33:10,449
[SPEAKER_25]: We'll talk about this at length, hopefully not too much at length, but we'll talk about this shortly.

2170
03:33:10,669 --> 03:33:11,870
[SPEAKER_25]: So thank you for being here.

2171
03:33:13,231 --> 03:33:13,992
[SPEAKER_25]: We are going to take it up.

2172
03:33:14,472 --> 03:33:14,713
[SPEAKER_25]: Thanks.

2173
03:33:19,570 --> 03:33:20,571
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you, Councilor Lazzaro.

2174
03:33:20,911 --> 03:33:21,931
[SPEAKER_35]: Councilor Collins, are you good?

2175
03:33:23,432 --> 03:33:27,354
[SPEAKER_35]: All right, we'll go to the podium, or what do you want?

2176
03:33:27,374 --> 03:33:28,075
[SPEAKER_35]: Okay, great.

2177
03:33:28,695 --> 03:33:31,837
[SPEAKER_35]: We'll go back to, actually, I'm sorry, we do have a hand on Zoom.

2178
03:33:31,897 --> 03:33:35,739
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm gonna take the hand on Zoom, and then we'll come back to the podium.

2179
03:33:38,720 --> 03:33:40,621
[SPEAKER_35]: Lara Germanis, name and address for the record, please.

2180
03:33:40,661 --> 03:33:41,442
[SPEAKER_35]: You have three minutes.

2181
03:33:42,267 --> 03:33:42,747
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

2182
03:33:43,347 --> 03:33:44,428
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Lara Germanis.

2183
03:33:44,668 --> 03:33:49,869
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm actually a Malden resident, but grew up for many years and lived in Medford.

2184
03:33:51,009 --> 03:34:03,513
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just wanted to intervene briefly as a physician and also as somebody who has been spending an extensive period of time both reading the humanitarian literature and

2185
03:34:04,914 --> 03:34:11,180
[SPEAKER_07]: working on other campaigns, studying other campaigns, which have involved divestment.

2186
03:34:11,720 --> 03:34:21,129
[SPEAKER_07]: Just a comment regarding some of the remarks that have been made earlier about this ordinance, which, you know, the language is quite circumspect.

2187
03:34:21,409 --> 03:34:24,112
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll say, you know, some of the language in

2188
03:34:25,593 --> 03:34:40,317
[SPEAKER_07]: Section 2697D, which specifies that public funds should not be invested in severe violations of human rights and international law as determined by international legal and humanitarian bodies.

2189
03:34:41,218 --> 03:34:52,101
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, that language regarding international legal and humanitarian bodies is, you know, is quite similar to language which has been recommended by international law.

2190
03:34:52,761 --> 03:34:56,865
[SPEAKER_07]: Humanitarian law professors for other divestment language.

2191
03:34:57,646 --> 03:35:11,397
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, while the word severe is not particularly specific, it is actually very consistent with precedent set by other divestment ordinances that have been pursued by institutions and local governments and that.

2192
03:35:12,198 --> 03:35:28,110
[SPEAKER_07]: This particular kind of language has been used in resolutions that have referred back to guidance that is offered by the American Friends Service Committee for organizations that are invested in war crimes.

2193
03:35:28,610 --> 03:35:42,435
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's a lot of lenience and latitude for the city council in the implementation of this ordinance to make sure that it does not change investments in ways that significantly harm taxpayers.

2194
03:35:42,555 --> 03:35:56,020
[SPEAKER_07]: But accusations that workers and companies are going to be harmed or that companies are offshoring work because of divestment, as opposed to because of opportunities to exploit workers in other countries, I find to be

2195
03:35:57,940 --> 03:35:59,321
[SPEAKER_07]: sort of in bad faith.

2196
03:36:00,761 --> 03:36:08,143
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, I think as evidenced this evening by the number of residents who have spoken out, you know, nobody's trying to hide anything.

2197
03:36:08,163 --> 03:36:13,064
[SPEAKER_07]: But if we are going to oppose war crimes, we must oppose them everywhere in the world.

2198
03:36:13,164 --> 03:36:25,868
[SPEAKER_07]: We should impose genocide in Sudan, in Palestine, and we should oppose human rights abuses when they occur on our own city streets with masked ICE agents using secret police tactics to detain people.

2199
03:36:26,788 --> 03:36:34,471
[SPEAKER_07]: and the inhumane conditions that people are experiencing in private prisons.

2200
03:36:34,652 --> 03:36:38,893
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's why it's really apt that these all go together in this divestment resolution.

2201
03:36:38,953 --> 03:36:40,414
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much for your leadership.

2202
03:36:40,494 --> 03:36:44,056
[SPEAKER_07]: And I do wish that the council had the opportunity to pass it this evening.

2203
03:36:45,856 --> 03:36:46,537
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

2204
03:36:47,537 --> 03:36:52,259
[SPEAKER_35]: Seeing no further hands on Zoom, I will go back to the podium.

2205
03:36:52,299 --> 03:36:53,400
[SPEAKER_35]: Name and address, please.

2206
03:36:53,420 --> 03:36:54,180
[SPEAKER_35]: You'll have three minutes.

2207
03:36:55,944 --> 03:36:58,006
[SPEAKER_39]: David Sayers 19 Park Street, Medford.

2208
03:36:59,407 --> 03:37:10,737
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you, President Bears I certainly appreciate the sentiment and the intent that you said this was put forth as, and I take you at your word that it's not like you had some ulterior motive when.

2209
03:37:11,998 --> 03:37:30,252
[SPEAKER_39]: When you put this forth, but it also seems very clear for many of the people that have spoken that the treasurer collector would be under enormous pressure to actually divest in one perhaps only one country Israel and the indigenous Jewish population that that lives there.

2210
03:37:31,573 --> 03:37:42,721
[SPEAKER_39]: It's nice to think that we could divest from a company or multiple companies and end war and weapons, but that simply isn't the case because our enemies don't buy weapons from those countries, they make their own.

2211
03:37:43,221 --> 03:37:45,523
[SPEAKER_39]: And so we need defensive weapons.

2212
03:37:46,604 --> 03:37:47,985
[SPEAKER_39]: In addition, how would you even

2213
03:37:48,905 --> 03:37:52,547
[SPEAKER_39]: go about accomplishing this ordinance.

2214
03:37:52,707 --> 03:37:58,150
[SPEAKER_39]: The parts in the thermostat over there are also the same parts that are used in weapons.

2215
03:37:58,230 --> 03:38:04,753
[SPEAKER_39]: I understand the air conditioning is not working very well right now, so maybe we don't think we need it, but I'm guessing we do.

2216
03:38:07,551 --> 03:38:16,636
[SPEAKER_39]: These international legal and vaguely humanitarian bonds list all sorts of companies, including Google and Microsoft Word that work with Israel and its military.

2217
03:38:17,296 --> 03:38:18,957
[SPEAKER_39]: Did you use Word to draft this?

2218
03:38:18,977 --> 03:38:22,878
[SPEAKER_39]: If so, you may have committed, you may have been supporting war crimes.

2219
03:38:23,559 --> 03:38:27,060
[SPEAKER_39]: It's very complicated and hard to do.

2220
03:38:27,301 --> 03:38:30,242
[SPEAKER_39]: And I'm not sure that the city should take it on.

2221
03:38:30,302 --> 03:38:34,144
[SPEAKER_39]: As individuals, obviously we can invest or divest from anything we'd like.

2222
03:38:35,190 --> 03:38:46,778
[SPEAKER_39]: In terms of fossil fuels, I'd love to say, yeah, we should be divesting from all these companies, investing in solar panels, but we buy the solar panels from countries that commit human rights violations.

2223
03:38:47,815 --> 03:38:55,483
[SPEAKER_39]: It's not so easy to say that we're going to live by a very specific set of values.

2224
03:38:55,704 --> 03:38:57,225
[SPEAKER_39]: And how are these values determined?

2225
03:38:57,385 --> 03:39:02,371
[SPEAKER_39]: Why are we not including states that support terrorism?

2226
03:39:02,791 --> 03:39:07,916
[SPEAKER_39]: Why are we not including companies that maybe don't support LGBTQ plus rights or women's rights?

2227
03:39:09,012 --> 03:39:11,994
[SPEAKER_39]: or freedom of religion or whatever the values are.

2228
03:39:12,054 --> 03:39:18,918
[SPEAKER_39]: How do we decide, how do you decide as a city council, what the collective values of the people you represent are?

2229
03:39:19,238 --> 03:39:21,680
[SPEAKER_39]: Some of these values I agree with, but not all of them.

2230
03:39:21,720 --> 03:39:26,663
[SPEAKER_39]: And obviously from people who've spoken, they disagree with me on what values are important or not.

2231
03:39:27,723 --> 03:39:45,459
[SPEAKER_39]: And like I said, as individuals, obviously we can do what we want, but as a city council trying to represent the entire city of Medford, it's not clear to me that this truly represents, though I understand its intent, but that this truly represents or will be used to represent the values of the population of Medford.

2232
03:39:45,799 --> 03:39:46,140
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

2233
03:39:47,381 --> 03:39:47,741
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

2234
03:39:47,761 --> 03:39:52,685
[SPEAKER_35]: Do we have anyone who would like to speak who hasn't spoken on this topic?

2235
03:39:52,705 --> 03:39:54,347
[SPEAKER_35]: And Ellen, you did speak right at the beginning, right?

2236
03:39:55,542 --> 03:39:56,062
[SPEAKER_35]: Not on this one.

2237
03:39:56,102 --> 03:40:00,485
[SPEAKER_35]: All right, then we'll take Ellen, and then we'll go to anyone else who hasn't spoken yet.

2238
03:40:00,925 --> 03:40:08,689
[SPEAKER_35]: And then we'll come back around for one more minute for people who have already spoken, but Ellen, you have the floor name and address for the record please you have three minutes.

2239
03:40:09,630 --> 03:40:14,913
[SPEAKER_17]: Ellen Epstein 15 growth street, Jewish resident of Medford.

2240
03:40:19,817 --> 03:40:39,945
[SPEAKER_17]: I just want to say that any lack of safety that I feel as a Jewish person in this world right now is the result of the actions of the State of Israel and our own government, which has supported and enabled the actions of the State of Israel.

2241
03:40:40,545 --> 03:40:43,386
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's unfortunate actually that that

2242
03:40:45,397 --> 03:40:49,939
[SPEAKER_17]: point of view is being brought into this discussion about clean investing.

2243
03:40:51,840 --> 03:41:08,988
[SPEAKER_17]: I was shocked to find out that city funds are invested in these companies and, you know, clean investment is not only possible, it's common and it does not necessarily mean lower returns.

2244
03:41:10,019 --> 03:41:18,163
[SPEAKER_17]: So, I really do hope that this resolution moves forward.

2245
03:41:18,323 --> 03:41:21,964
[SPEAKER_17]: I thank you, President Bears, for bringing it forward.

2246
03:41:25,446 --> 03:41:26,446
[SPEAKER_17]: That's it, thank you.

2247
03:41:26,466 --> 03:41:29,988
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you.

2248
03:41:30,068 --> 03:41:33,449
[SPEAKER_35]: One second, we have somebody who hasn't spoken yet on Zoom.

2249
03:41:34,030 --> 03:41:37,551
[SPEAKER_35]: Meneer Jimenez, I'll recognize you, and you will have three minutes.

2250
03:41:37,931 --> 03:41:38,992
[SPEAKER_35]: Name and address for the record, please.

2251
03:41:40,798 --> 03:41:46,441
[SPEAKER_34]: Ah, Munir Germanus.

2252
03:41:46,621 --> 03:41:50,763
[SPEAKER_34]: I cannot turn my video on for some reason, but I'll continue anyway.

2253
03:41:51,723 --> 03:41:52,724
[SPEAKER_34]: I'll be very brief.

2254
03:41:53,995 --> 03:42:07,566
[SPEAKER_34]: I appreciate the fact that this resolution, this proposal has been put forth, now that President Trump has directly involved our country in yet another unprovoked war.

2255
03:42:08,707 --> 03:42:11,269
[SPEAKER_34]: The stocks of our weapon manufacturers are soaring.

2256
03:42:12,850 --> 03:42:18,455
[SPEAKER_34]: I see this as an amazing ordinance that will divest Medford's fund from fossil fuels.

2257
03:42:19,592 --> 03:42:29,998
[SPEAKER_34]: from profit prisons and detention centers, weapon companies, military contractors, and many other things.

2258
03:42:30,299 --> 03:42:32,080
[SPEAKER_34]: I mean, our values matter.

2259
03:42:33,640 --> 03:42:40,625
[SPEAKER_34]: Today, some of the public funds that our city manages are invested in some of the world's largest weapons manufacturers.

2260
03:42:41,305 --> 03:42:46,268
[SPEAKER_34]: These companies are complicit in expanding these wars and are benefiting from them.

2261
03:42:47,116 --> 03:42:50,637
[SPEAKER_34]: And our government uses our tax dollars to support these wars.

2262
03:42:51,257 --> 03:43:09,421
[SPEAKER_34]: In the meantime, if you've heard the news, many of our congresspeople make illegal profits by manipulating the stock market, along with a leader who benefits every time he makes a declaration that plays havoc with the value of stocks and suits the purpose of insiders who benefit from them.

2263
03:43:11,586 --> 03:43:19,372
[SPEAKER_34]: Another example is businesses that are helping destroy communities through violence and incarceration.

2264
03:43:19,452 --> 03:43:34,823
[SPEAKER_34]: This is certainly to be avoided considering how many innocent people who are arrested by ICE are artificially held for longer periods of incarceration so the folks who run these detention centers can make more money doing so.

2265
03:43:35,724 --> 03:43:36,705
[SPEAKER_34]: I urgently

2266
03:43:37,490 --> 03:43:46,457
[SPEAKER_34]: ardently urge all members of the City Council to approve and support this ordinance that reflects our morals and our values.

2267
03:43:47,037 --> 03:43:47,438
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you.

2268
03:43:49,519 --> 03:43:50,019
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

2269
03:43:51,841 --> 03:43:55,343
[SPEAKER_35]: We have one more person on Zoom who has not spoken yet on this item.

2270
03:43:56,304 --> 03:43:58,125
[SPEAKER_35]: Go to Eileen Lerner.

2271
03:43:58,165 --> 03:44:00,988
[SPEAKER_35]: Name and address for the record, please, and you will have three minutes.

2272
03:44:04,137 --> 03:44:10,261
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm Eileen Lerner, and I live at 3920 Mystic Valley Parkway in Medford.

2273
03:44:10,961 --> 03:44:23,770
[SPEAKER_19]: And I just want to say that somebody said this was a divisive proposal, but I see it as a unifying one.

2274
03:44:25,560 --> 03:44:26,980
[SPEAKER_19]: Let us all be together.

2275
03:44:27,821 --> 03:44:31,222
[SPEAKER_19]: Let us all have values of peace.

2276
03:44:31,362 --> 03:44:34,823
[SPEAKER_19]: And I mean, it's possible.

2277
03:44:35,603 --> 03:44:36,683
[SPEAKER_19]: It's possible.

2278
03:44:36,783 --> 03:44:39,564
[SPEAKER_19]: We know how to cure the environment.

2279
03:44:39,804 --> 03:44:41,565
[SPEAKER_19]: We know how to do a lot of things.

2280
03:44:42,665 --> 03:44:48,367
[SPEAKER_19]: But we seem to have been caught up in this repetitive, destructive syndrome.

2281
03:44:49,627 --> 03:44:52,008
[SPEAKER_19]: And I see this proposal as being

2282
03:44:53,877 --> 03:45:10,023
[SPEAKER_19]: you know, something new, at least, you know, a significant effort not to join the Lemings, not to, as they march off to the cliff and jump off.

2283
03:45:11,604 --> 03:45:18,306
[SPEAKER_19]: So I just want to thank all of you and urge you to vote for this proposal.

2284
03:45:19,207 --> 03:45:19,647
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

2285
03:45:19,667 --> 03:45:21,688
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

2286
03:45:24,432 --> 03:45:28,935
[SPEAKER_35]: All right, anyone in person or on Zoom who has not spoken, who would like to speak?

2287
03:45:29,956 --> 03:45:31,778
[SPEAKER_35]: We'll take you, Mr. Castagnetti.

2288
03:45:31,838 --> 03:45:33,439
[SPEAKER_35]: Name and address for the record, please.

2289
03:45:34,019 --> 03:45:34,920
[SPEAKER_35]: You'll have three minutes.

2290
03:45:40,524 --> 03:45:41,765
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Villes.

2291
03:45:41,805 --> 03:45:42,606
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

2292
03:45:42,666 --> 03:45:46,089
[SPEAKER_03]: Castagnetti, East Medford, Massachusetts.

2293
03:45:50,552 --> 03:45:53,895
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go again with national and international issues.

2294
03:45:56,298 --> 03:45:58,400
[SPEAKER_03]: but please do fix our potholes.

2295
03:45:58,780 --> 03:46:00,742
[SPEAKER_03]: Still, I really appreciate that.

2296
03:46:02,403 --> 03:46:03,924
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll agree, war is hell.

2297
03:46:04,965 --> 03:46:11,711
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, war is worse than hell, because in hell, you expect to burn, so they say.

2298
03:46:12,532 --> 03:46:17,796
[SPEAKER_03]: But in war, you don't know what village is gonna be napalmed or bombed.

2299
03:46:19,017 --> 03:46:20,819
[SPEAKER_03]: So war is worse than hell.

2300
03:46:21,760 --> 03:46:23,181
[SPEAKER_03]: And normally, I'm for peace,

2301
03:46:24,115 --> 03:46:26,156
[SPEAKER_03]: as you should know by my record from 1969.

2302
03:46:29,417 --> 03:46:36,481
[SPEAKER_03]: But sometimes you need to use a big stick to stop us, for example, from speaking German or Japanese.

2303
03:46:39,082 --> 03:46:50,087
[SPEAKER_03]: Fossil pollution is not great, but you can't not snap your finger and get off the oil addiction.

2304
03:46:51,087 --> 03:46:52,188
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not feasible.

2305
03:46:53,755 --> 03:46:57,496
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care how you vote because you really listened to my advice anyway.

2306
03:46:58,676 --> 03:46:58,976
[SPEAKER_03]: Shalom.

2307
03:46:58,996 --> 03:47:03,117
[SPEAKER_35]: All right.

2308
03:47:03,397 --> 03:47:07,878
[SPEAKER_35]: Is there anyone who has not spoken on this issue who would like to speak?

2309
03:47:10,238 --> 03:47:17,599
[SPEAKER_35]: Seeing no hands on Zoom and no one in person, we'll go back to the podium for one more minute each for anyone who has already spoken.

2310
03:47:17,619 --> 03:47:21,300
[SPEAKER_35]: Name and address for the record, please.

2311
03:47:23,559 --> 03:47:38,374
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to talk about the technicalities of this, but I also want to, I think it's really important to maybe convince some of my haverim about what, to show that this is, Zionist is not a Jewish thing and Jewish is not Zionist.

2312
03:47:38,814 --> 03:47:44,080
[SPEAKER_16]: This is a letter, dear Spector, translated from 1930 from a Jewish refugee to the United States.

2313
03:47:44,882 --> 03:47:47,864
[SPEAKER_16]: Do not think that your Zionist political positions are originally Jewish.

2314
03:47:48,285 --> 03:47:51,287
[SPEAKER_16]: Often you consider something long enough or you express something to yourself.

2315
03:47:51,467 --> 03:47:54,430
[SPEAKER_16]: You begin to believe it to be your own creation or some new form of thought.

2316
03:47:54,910 --> 03:47:55,911
[SPEAKER_16]: This is nonsense.

2317
03:47:56,491 --> 03:47:59,053
[SPEAKER_16]: Dusty and decomposed ideas are instead speaking for you.

2318
03:47:59,133 --> 03:48:05,719
[SPEAKER_16]: In this way, just as a Zionist sees the world and in one light, his countrymen see him as not much more than just another nationalist.

2319
03:48:06,239 --> 03:48:10,063
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's consider the latest clearest manifestation of nationalism, Hitlerism.

2320
03:48:10,603 --> 03:48:17,490
[SPEAKER_16]: Hundreds of thousands of young Germans are enthusiastic for Hitler, for Germany, and for Germaness, just as you and your friends are for the land of Israel and Jewishness.

2321
03:48:18,050 --> 03:48:21,634
[SPEAKER_16]: They believe their Germany to be surrounded by its enemies, England, France, Poland.

2322
03:48:21,974 --> 03:48:23,195
[SPEAKER_16]: God punish England, they cry.

2323
03:48:23,235 --> 03:48:24,957
[SPEAKER_16]: Their Germany has been pillaged and violated.

2324
03:48:25,929 --> 03:48:32,954
[SPEAKER_16]: go through a lot of it, but ask yourself, is Arabs out, not the very same slogan as a Jude and Rose.

2325
03:48:33,355 --> 03:48:37,678
[SPEAKER_16]: This is from 1930, before the Holocaust.

2326
03:48:39,139 --> 03:48:40,680
[SPEAKER_16]: Zionism is not Judaism.

2327
03:48:41,221 --> 03:48:42,121
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not the same thing.

2328
03:48:42,281 --> 03:48:44,583
[SPEAKER_16]: And equivocating it is anti-Semitic.

2329
03:48:44,603 --> 03:48:45,224
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Micah.

2330
03:48:49,947 --> 03:48:53,650
[SPEAKER_33]: Maybe the rest of the record, you have one minute and about 30 seconds left for that.

2331
03:48:57,809 --> 03:48:58,490
[SPEAKER_35]: You'll have one minute.

2332
03:48:58,530 --> 03:49:02,434
[SPEAKER_35]: And since I let my go over by 30 seconds, I'll go within 30 seconds.

2333
03:49:05,617 --> 03:49:19,910
[SPEAKER_20]: My community is afraid of stochastic terrorism, where the repeated demonization of a particular people in our case, Jewish people, by extension through the state of Israel, which I agree my physical and safety also stems from the actions of a government that I do not support.

2334
03:49:20,270 --> 03:49:20,591
[SPEAKER_20]: And yet,

2335
03:49:21,031 --> 03:49:29,355
[SPEAKER_20]: The people who were murdered in DC, who were attacked in Boulder, were not asked for their position about Zionism, about Israel, about Palestine, about anything.

2336
03:49:29,395 --> 03:49:35,417
[SPEAKER_20]: They were murdered for being Jews, and we are afraid that that will happen to someone here in Medford.

2337
03:49:35,457 --> 03:49:43,641
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not a question of if, but it's when and where, and we deserve protection also, although the progressive community seems to have decided that we do not.

2338
03:49:46,622 --> 03:49:47,743
[SPEAKER_35]: Vice President Collins.

2339
03:49:50,787 --> 03:49:52,588
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm not debating, I'm just taking a point of personal privilege.

2340
03:49:56,912 --> 03:49:58,033
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, President Bears.

2341
03:49:58,053 --> 03:49:59,714
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you for indulging me to my fellow councillors.

2342
03:50:01,856 --> 03:50:06,479
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, I'm very moved by a lot of what I have heard tonight.

2343
03:50:07,780 --> 03:50:10,803
[SPEAKER_24]: And I am quite shocked by some of it.

2344
03:50:12,244 --> 03:50:17,828
[SPEAKER_24]: Certainly finding procedural reasons to stall on timely and urgently needed reforms is catching on as a trend in the city of Medford.

2345
03:50:20,550 --> 03:50:24,051
[SPEAKER_24]: I heard tonight that standing up against war crimes is divisive.

2346
03:50:24,712 --> 03:50:29,673
[SPEAKER_24]: I heard that the Jewish community is unilateral in its feelings on this topic and its feelings on Israel.

2347
03:50:29,693 --> 03:50:39,577
[SPEAKER_24]: I heard it implied that Jewish discomfort stands as more of a clear and present danger than genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity.

2348
03:50:40,718 --> 03:50:46,540
[SPEAKER_24]: I have heard antisemitism and the protest of Israeli war crimes, once again, falsely conflated.

2349
03:50:47,699 --> 03:50:57,362
[SPEAKER_24]: I have heard that the United Nations, a crowning achievement of international cooperation is illegitimate because it is called a spade a spade in observing war crimes and genocide.

2350
03:50:59,223 --> 03:51:03,904
[SPEAKER_24]: I have heard, excuse me, I'm taking up points.

2351
03:51:07,225 --> 03:51:15,588
[SPEAKER_24]: I have heard wild mischaracterizations and deeply offensive language used to disparage the council's process on the ceasefire resolution last year.

2352
03:51:16,312 --> 03:51:22,095
[SPEAKER_24]: including what I would call outright lies about what was or communicated or not communicated to me, the resolution sponsor.

2353
03:51:22,795 --> 03:51:24,936
[SPEAKER_24]: People can feel free to call me out directly about that.

2354
03:51:25,616 --> 03:51:26,016
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't care.

2355
03:51:26,036 --> 03:51:29,438
[SPEAKER_24]: I am very proud of that resolution and very secure in my Jewish identity.

2356
03:51:30,398 --> 03:51:36,741
[SPEAKER_24]: I have heard voices decrying divestment as illegitimate because some of its proponents wear keffiyehs and have ties in Gaza.

2357
03:51:37,621 --> 03:51:38,322
[SPEAKER_24]: That makes me wonder,

2358
03:51:39,211 --> 03:51:43,156
[SPEAKER_24]: What about the opponents of divestment who are deeply embedded with Christian Zionism?

2359
03:51:43,757 --> 03:51:45,879
[SPEAKER_24]: Are they given reciprocal scrutiny and skepticism?

2360
03:51:46,600 --> 03:51:49,484
[SPEAKER_24]: Do we throw out that whole idea because of this association?

2361
03:51:49,504 --> 03:51:53,969
[SPEAKER_24]: I received hundreds of messages from people today associated with that identity.

2362
03:51:54,850 --> 03:52:09,512
[SPEAKER_24]: These are people who see me and my family as Jews as nothing more than pawns, entities that must be deported to the nation of Israel and, depending on their ideology, converted to Christianity so that so-called real Christians may experience the revelation and ascend with Jesus to heaven.

2363
03:52:12,695 --> 03:52:21,342
[SPEAKER_24]: People and Councilors are saying, or in some cases, heavily implying that this ordinance should be stalled or scrapped because it implicates Israel.

2364
03:52:22,103 --> 03:52:25,106
[SPEAKER_24]: As though Palestinian solidarity is invalidating.

2365
03:52:27,728 --> 03:52:29,489
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm taking a point of personal privilege.

2366
03:52:33,152 --> 03:52:39,418
[SPEAKER_24]: As if Palestinian solidarity is invalidating, that that opinion is cancerous.

2367
03:52:40,853 --> 03:52:59,620
[SPEAKER_24]: Apparently, our ability to be in alignment with our values to divest from things that we know are making us sick and making us unsafe and directly contradicting our values, our ability to take a vote tonight to be the community that we report to be has an obstacle, a fear of telling the truth when it comes to Israel.

2368
03:53:00,400 --> 03:53:09,324
[SPEAKER_24]: If you listen to President Bears' preamble, you will have heard that these procedural questions and these concerns about fiscal responsibility are the real quote unquote thin veil

2369
03:53:09,811 --> 03:53:10,972
[SPEAKER_24]: going on in this conversation.

2370
03:53:10,992 --> 03:53:22,099
[SPEAKER_24]: Thinly veiling that the real obstacle to divesting from fossil fuel infrastructure, private prisons, weapons manufacturing, and entities implicated in human rights violations is Zionism.

2371
03:53:23,252 --> 03:53:44,251
[SPEAKER_24]: I am once again disgusted that my identity is being used to justify remaining invested in nations that flout international law and wage genocide against populations deemed inconvenient that have been allowed to poison our environment for decades, and for for profit presence that lock up innocent and vulnerable people, quite possibly, including neighbors of our own community.

2372
03:53:45,212 --> 03:53:51,473
[SPEAKER_24]: As a Jew, I cannot make heads or tails of the argument that this goal of divesting from destructive entities is anti-Jewish in any way.

2373
03:53:51,993 --> 03:54:08,777
[SPEAKER_24]: It is deeply aligned with the Jewish values that I hold most dear, which is that tikkun olam, repairing the world, and solidarity with oppressed peoples, is my Jewish family's most foundational value, not blind fealty to any ethnostate.

2374
03:54:09,915 --> 03:54:28,622
[SPEAKER_24]: I look forward to discussing this matter again in the future with my colleagues and with the community, hopefully very soon, and to the chair, and through the chair, to all those who have been brave enough to support this progressive action, to those who speak in favor, to those who were brave enough to share any opinion on this matter, including those who disagree with me.

2375
03:54:28,642 --> 03:54:33,984
[SPEAKER_24]: I would like to say, Yashir Chalaf, may your strength persist and grow.

2376
03:54:35,045 --> 03:54:35,285
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2377
03:54:53,058 --> 03:54:53,919
[SPEAKER_33]: Councilor Scarpell.

2378
03:55:10,071 --> 03:55:10,491
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

2379
03:55:10,511 --> 03:55:12,393
[SPEAKER_35]: I want to thank everyone for their input tonight.

2380
03:55:13,213 --> 03:55:16,876
[SPEAKER_35]: I know that a conversation about lack of neutrality,

2381
03:55:18,876 --> 03:55:21,898
[SPEAKER_35]: and support and opposition has been raised by everyone here.

2382
03:55:22,459 --> 03:55:28,943
[SPEAKER_35]: And I think what I'm about to say, I was about to say we'll probably please no one or at least displease everyone in some way.

2383
03:55:30,724 --> 03:55:35,808
[SPEAKER_35]: I want to be very clear, international law and international norms matter.

2384
03:55:36,528 --> 03:55:46,275
[SPEAKER_35]: While it may be impossible to find a standard that everyone can agree to, I firmly believe that the core values of our international order that World War II was fought to establish

2385
03:55:47,918 --> 03:55:50,640
[SPEAKER_35]: One, the right of all peoples to self-determination.

2386
03:55:51,421 --> 03:55:55,004
[SPEAKER_35]: Two, the integrity of internationally recognized borders of nations.

2387
03:55:55,765 --> 03:56:00,108
[SPEAKER_35]: Three, opposition to unilateral military action and the occupation of territory.

2388
03:56:00,809 --> 03:56:06,694
[SPEAKER_35]: Four, the inherent right of individuals to life and freedom must be the foundation of that standard.

2389
03:56:07,655 --> 03:56:13,960
[SPEAKER_35]: Any nation or company violates that standard, or quite frankly, any non-governmental, non-nation entity

2390
03:56:15,209 --> 03:56:19,652
[SPEAKER_35]: someone acting or a company supporting private efforts in any place.

2391
03:56:21,233 --> 03:56:22,113
[SPEAKER_35]: That must be the bar.

2392
03:56:22,753 --> 03:56:26,596
[SPEAKER_35]: And that is the standard I will continue to push for as this ordinance moves forward.

2393
03:56:28,157 --> 03:56:34,220
[SPEAKER_35]: No one is demonizing janitors or people who work every day just to survive here in Medford or abroad.

2394
03:56:34,840 --> 03:56:42,425
[SPEAKER_35]: When we say no kings, we say no to the billionaire CEOs, the 1% investors who profit most from the industry of death.

2395
03:56:43,478 --> 03:56:54,950
[SPEAKER_35]: As working people, our personal investments, if we have them, and our collective public investments, the investments of our communities, of our government, are our only method to influence the private market.

2396
03:56:55,750 --> 03:57:07,202
[SPEAKER_35]: I promise you that even if every city and town in Massachusetts chose not to invest in weapons manufacturers, the financial influence and capital flows of the military-industrial complex will remain well represented.

2397
03:57:09,203 --> 03:57:14,428
[SPEAKER_35]: What I didn't say in my introductory floor speech is that this issue is deeply personal to me.

2398
03:57:15,228 --> 03:57:26,018
[SPEAKER_35]: I know what it looks like to have friends and loved ones who are afraid for their safety and for their family's safety, both Jews and Palestinians, both in Palestine and Israel and right here at home.

2399
03:57:27,179 --> 03:57:27,880
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm not Jewish.

2400
03:57:29,581 --> 03:57:30,302
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm not Muslim.

2401
03:57:30,702 --> 03:57:31,743
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm not a Palestinian.

2402
03:57:32,756 --> 03:57:33,597
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm not Israeli.

2403
03:57:34,117 --> 03:57:37,579
[SPEAKER_35]: When I hear real concerns of anyone for their, excuse me, thank you.

2404
03:57:37,639 --> 03:57:39,381
[SPEAKER_35]: Councilor Scarpelli, you're out of order.

2405
03:57:40,061 --> 03:57:41,202
[SPEAKER_35]: Councilor Scarpelli, please.

2406
03:57:41,602 --> 03:57:42,643
[SPEAKER_35]: Councilor Scarpelli, please.

2407
03:57:43,724 --> 03:57:44,784
[SPEAKER_35]: Councilor Scarpelli, please.

2408
03:57:44,884 --> 03:57:47,146
[SPEAKER_35]: Can you please respect your fellow councilor, sir?

2409
03:57:47,526 --> 03:57:47,887
[SPEAKER_35]: You're not.

2410
03:57:48,627 --> 03:57:49,528
[SPEAKER_35]: Councilor Scarpelli.

2411
03:57:49,748 --> 03:57:51,229
[SPEAKER_35]: Councilor Scarpelli, we'll wait.

2412
03:57:52,089 --> 03:57:52,730
[SPEAKER_35]: We'll wait, sir.

2413
03:57:54,251 --> 03:57:54,791
[SPEAKER_35]: We'll wait, sir.

2414
03:57:55,292 --> 03:57:56,913
[SPEAKER_35]: We can wait for your tantrum to finish.

2415
03:57:58,245 --> 03:58:02,908
[SPEAKER_35]: Councilor Collins, please just, we'll wait for Councilor Scarpelli to respect the chair and the floor.

2416
03:58:05,629 --> 03:58:07,190
[SPEAKER_35]: Well, vote me out.

2417
03:58:13,053 --> 03:58:13,434
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

2418
03:58:15,295 --> 03:58:20,918
[SPEAKER_35]: When I hear the real concerns of anyone in my community for their safety, I take it very seriously.

2419
03:58:22,373 --> 03:58:33,556
[SPEAKER_35]: What I cannot and will not accept is that it is polarizing or divisive to impose the investment of city funds and companies that violate international law and the basic standards of our liberal international order.

2420
03:58:34,556 --> 03:58:35,617
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm not anti-Israel.

2421
03:58:36,057 --> 03:58:37,437
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm not anti-Palestine.

2422
03:58:38,057 --> 03:58:41,098
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm not anti-defending democracy against legitimate threats.

2423
03:58:41,858 --> 03:58:46,940
[SPEAKER_35]: I support the right to free democratic states in Palestine and Israel.

2424
03:58:50,189 --> 03:59:16,720
[SPEAKER_35]: I am against the standard that says it is inherently anti-Israel or anti-Semitic to oppose the actions of the Netanyahu regime, or that it is anti-Chinese to support the actions of the Xi regime, or that it is anti-Hindu to support the actions of the Modi regime, or anti-Muslim that it is to support the actions of the bin Salman regime, or that it is anti-Korean to support the actions of the Kim regime, or that it is anti-Christian or anti-American to support the actions of the Trump regime.

2425
03:59:17,965 --> 03:59:32,193
[SPEAKER_35]: I am deeply concerned about the weaponization and accusations of anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, anti-Christianism, anti-Hinduism, and other biases and hate to sifle free speech and legitimate opposition to the actions of governments.

2426
03:59:33,654 --> 03:59:40,518
[SPEAKER_35]: I fear that this undermines our efforts to identify and combat hate and hate crimes.

2427
03:59:41,298 --> 03:59:44,760
[SPEAKER_35]: And I especially fear that it condones or incites hate or hate crimes.

2428
03:59:53,966 --> 04:00:09,100
[SPEAKER_36]: I hold this fear for members of my family and my friends and my loved ones, some of whom are Jewish, some of whom are Muslim, some of whom are neither.

2429
04:00:11,842 --> 04:00:17,748
[SPEAKER_36]: I look forward to further discussions, and we may end up disagreeing at the end of those discussions.

2430
04:00:23,518 --> 04:00:27,640
[SPEAKER_36]: but I will also hold close the fears of people for their safety.

2431
04:00:28,821 --> 04:00:38,727
[SPEAKER_36]: I will work to address them while I also hold to my steadfast principle and commitment to international law that applies equally to all nations and all peoples.

2432
04:00:40,368 --> 04:00:42,910
[SPEAKER_36]: Consensus is never possible in a democracy.

2433
04:00:43,270 --> 04:00:47,272
[SPEAKER_36]: When we ask, how will we determine our shared values and what we stand for?

2434
04:00:47,332 --> 04:00:50,054
[SPEAKER_35]: The answer is simple, self-determination.

2435
04:00:51,207 --> 04:01:05,261
[SPEAKER_35]: by electing representatives to pass laws through the legislative process afforded to us by the Constitution of our country and our state, and replacing those elected officials when their actions do not reflect the will of the voters of their community.

2436
04:01:05,882 --> 04:01:08,104
[SPEAKER_35]: If this proposal or my values

2437
04:01:09,239 --> 04:01:22,407
[SPEAKER_35]: or my actions do not pass democratic or electoral muster, I will accept the result and I will be relieved that I live in a society where self-determination and freedom are at its foundation.

2438
04:01:23,368 --> 04:01:23,728
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

2439
04:01:23,748 --> 04:01:35,035
[SPEAKER_35]: Is there a motion on the floor?

2440
04:01:35,095 --> 04:01:36,596
[SPEAKER_35]: We have an ordinance for third reading.

2441

2461
04:03:22,760 --> 04:03:23,440

2487
04:04:55,452 --> 04:04:57,654
[SPEAKER_35]: I recognize Councilor Lazzaro, then Vice President Collins.

2488
04:04:57,694 --> 04:04:58,554
[SPEAKER_35]: Councilor Lazzaro.

2489
04:04:59,875 --> 04:05:00,295
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

2490
04:05:00,656 --> 04:05:00,976
[SPEAKER_25]: I have

2491
04:05:03,076 --> 04:05:05,458
[SPEAKER_25]: offered a very similar paper before.

2492
04:05:05,738 --> 04:05:13,744
[SPEAKER_25]: And this is a reiteration of the same resolution, but with new information this Saturday.

2493
04:05:13,764 --> 04:05:20,889
[SPEAKER_25]: At about noon, or maybe just before that, I received an email from a resident in my neighborhood.

2494
04:05:21,590 --> 04:05:26,953
[SPEAKER_25]: About half a block from where I live, somebody was arrested by ICE.

2495
04:05:31,110 --> 04:05:34,411
[SPEAKER_25]: I found out about it because a resident let me know.

2496
04:05:34,431 --> 04:05:43,653
[SPEAKER_25]: And I just so happened to have a meeting scheduled with our provisional police chief, Paul Covino, on Monday.

2497
04:05:45,154 --> 04:05:46,694
[SPEAKER_25]: And I discussed this issue with him.

2498
04:05:47,014 --> 04:05:56,237
[SPEAKER_25]: I was meant to meet with him to talk about the things that Chief Buckley and I had been discussing and that were ongoing issues.

2499
04:05:57,977 --> 04:06:19,075
[SPEAKER_25]: with the roads and various other items, but we talked about this and Chief Covino and I had a really, really great conversation about, you know, the hesitation of the Medford Police Department to offer something of use for us and

2500
04:06:20,976 --> 04:06:25,859
[SPEAKER_25]: The point of this resolution is not to catch the Medford Police Department out.

2501
04:06:26,159 --> 04:06:29,041
[SPEAKER_25]: It's not to get them in trouble.

2502
04:06:29,261 --> 04:06:37,306
[SPEAKER_25]: It's not to say, like, we're catching you working with ICE.

2503
04:06:37,606 --> 04:06:45,951
[SPEAKER_25]: I believe very firmly that the Medford Police Department is following the ordinances that we have set forth, that the

2504
04:06:47,451 --> 04:06:57,995
[SPEAKER_25]: Medford Police Department frequently is not made aware by federal immigration's enforcement of the operations that take place in Medford.

2505
04:06:58,495 --> 04:07:00,736
[SPEAKER_25]: And I think that a report could say that.

2506
04:07:01,597 --> 04:07:09,340
[SPEAKER_25]: In this case, Chief Covino told me he was, I knew more about this arrest than he did because I was told by a resident who witnessed it.

2507
04:07:10,212 --> 04:07:11,252
[SPEAKER_25]: because she lives across the street.

2508
04:07:11,792 --> 04:07:21,834
[SPEAKER_25]: And the that could be that I would be happy to receive that as a report because it would share information with our residents.

2509
04:07:22,114 --> 04:07:23,535
[SPEAKER_25]: I think it would settle fears.

2510
04:07:23,675 --> 04:07:30,816
[SPEAKER_25]: I think it would release any misinformation that may have been circulating.

2511
04:07:31,316 --> 04:07:32,657
[SPEAKER_25]: And I think it would reveal that.

2512
04:07:35,413 --> 04:07:46,241
[SPEAKER_25]: In Medford, we have a clear partnership with our law enforcement agency and that we are working together to keep us safe.

2513
04:07:47,642 --> 04:08:00,732
[SPEAKER_25]: And I also wanted to say that I had a conversation last week with another resident who said that when they asked

2514
04:08:02,248 --> 04:08:15,356
[SPEAKER_25]: When they saw somebody monitoring a neighborhood in Medford and they believed them to be law enforcement and they weren't sure if they were Medford police or ICE officers, they went and they asked for ID.

2515
04:08:17,766 --> 04:08:19,927
[SPEAKER_25]: and they were Medford police.

2516
04:08:20,788 --> 04:08:24,910
[SPEAKER_25]: The Medford police officers very quickly said, oh, we're Medford police.

2517
04:08:25,010 --> 04:08:25,831
[SPEAKER_25]: Here's our IDs.

2518
04:08:26,711 --> 04:08:29,293
[SPEAKER_25]: And the person was like, oh, great, wonderful.

2519
04:08:30,033 --> 04:08:31,834
[SPEAKER_25]: This is not upsetting.

2520
04:08:32,154 --> 04:08:33,055
[SPEAKER_25]: This is not scary.

2521
04:08:33,175 --> 04:08:34,175
[SPEAKER_25]: This is not concerning.

2522
04:08:34,816 --> 04:08:38,758
[SPEAKER_25]: This is a person who is not hiding themselves.

2523
04:08:38,858 --> 04:08:40,559
[SPEAKER_25]: This is a person who works with us.

2524
04:08:40,599 --> 04:08:44,721
[SPEAKER_25]: This is somebody who is part of the fabric of our community and who is

2525
04:08:46,397 --> 04:08:59,728
[SPEAKER_25]: doing the best that they can to be integrated in the work that we're all doing to maintain public safety and transparency and openness.

2526
04:09:00,288 --> 04:09:02,490
[SPEAKER_25]: So that's the goal of this resolution as far as I'm concerned.

2527
04:09:05,672 --> 04:09:08,134
[SPEAKER_25]: In our current environment where

2528
04:09:11,007 --> 04:09:18,489
[SPEAKER_25]: somebody may not be as readily willing to offer an ID when somebody asks them for it.

2529
04:09:20,429 --> 04:09:26,711
[SPEAKER_25]: That is a dangerous thing, especially for people who may be a local elected official.

2530
04:09:27,231 --> 04:09:37,394
[SPEAKER_25]: Somebody impersonated a police officer and then used that to shoot a local elected official and her husband and her dog in Minnesota.

2531
04:09:39,711 --> 04:09:43,092
[SPEAKER_25]: That is illegal and terrifying.

2532
04:09:45,673 --> 04:09:47,393
[SPEAKER_25]: I talked to Chief Cabino about that, too.

2533
04:09:47,954 --> 04:10:01,918
[SPEAKER_25]: And he affirmed to me, by the way, that if you ask a law enforcement officer from any department for identification while they are engaged in law enforcement activity and they don't give it to you, that you should call 911 right away.

2534
04:10:03,659 --> 04:10:06,439
[SPEAKER_25]: So if anybody's wondering about that, that's what you should do.

2535
04:10:08,645 --> 04:10:11,908
[SPEAKER_25]: That's not exactly the point of this resolution, but it's related.

2536
04:10:12,728 --> 04:10:14,730
[SPEAKER_25]: So thank you.

2537
04:10:14,910 --> 04:10:17,272
[SPEAKER_25]: This is just, you know, this happened over the weekend.

2538
04:10:17,312 --> 04:10:18,113
[SPEAKER_25]: It was past the deadline.

2539
04:10:18,153 --> 04:10:21,415
[SPEAKER_25]: So we offered this under suspension and I will stop talking now.

2540
04:10:21,576 --> 04:10:21,916
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

2541
04:10:30,443 --> 04:10:31,424
[SPEAKER_35]: Vice President Collins.

2542
04:10:34,586 --> 04:10:35,327
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, President Bears.

2543
04:10:36,027 --> 04:10:36,448
[SPEAKER_24]: I want to thank

2544
04:10:36,945 --> 04:10:41,070
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Councilor Lazzaro for co sponsoring this resolution with me.

2545
04:10:42,572 --> 04:10:52,144
[SPEAKER_24]: And thank you to the residents who reached out, not only to community networks about the ice arrest over the weekend, but also to city officials including myself and other city

2546
04:10:53,545 --> 04:10:59,768
[SPEAKER_24]: to make sure that we knew and to ask what more could be done to follow up on this abduction and to prevent future ones.

2547
04:10:59,788 --> 04:11:08,792
[SPEAKER_24]: I know Councilor Lazzaro shared a lot, and I appreciate the resident who spoke earlier who shared their experience and what they did in the aftermath of

2548
04:11:10,212 --> 04:11:13,594
[SPEAKER_24]: witnessing or hearing about a arrest in their neighborhood.

2549
04:11:15,294 --> 04:11:32,381
[SPEAKER_24]: We have, as President Bears mentioned earlier, we have had many discussions in many council meetings by this point on this topic of the presence of ICE in our community and whose responsibility it is to do what and what public safety means.

2550
04:11:34,102 --> 04:11:40,297
[SPEAKER_24]: In this time when the presence of law enforcement has a tenuous relationship to public safety,

2551
04:11:43,115 --> 04:11:58,558
[SPEAKER_24]: and what the responsibility of our local public safety is when federal law enforcement are conducting raids that are not related to, that are not convincingly related to public safety and do not meaningfully involve our local public safety officials.

2552
04:12:00,078 --> 04:12:08,160
[SPEAKER_24]: I have been very heartened to see the presence of the Loose Hotline and other community organizations like it proliferate throughout our community.

2553
04:12:08,960 --> 04:12:17,062
[SPEAKER_24]: and for folks who want to know who to call when they see, when they suspect or they hear a rumor about ICE in the community.

2554
04:12:17,082 --> 04:12:38,367
[SPEAKER_24]: I as one Councilor would recommend you to look up the loose hotline, explore their resources, get trained and be a part of that community network whose goals are to provide good information and spread good information and dispel rumors and spread preventative information about people's rights with immigration enforcement.

2555
04:12:39,854 --> 04:12:40,678
[SPEAKER_24]: At the same time, I am.

2556
04:12:42,912 --> 04:12:54,718
[SPEAKER_24]: again frustrated that community members have been put into, put into the position of having to be public safety officials when our local public safety officials should fulfill that role for us in every circumstance.

2557
04:12:55,479 --> 04:13:08,246
[SPEAKER_24]: And this resolution aims to be, we have brought up this idea with Medford Police Department before and we have heard some encouraging signs that this is something that they can do and something they're willing to do and I take that in good faith and I'm very heartened.

2558
04:13:10,166 --> 04:13:27,492
[SPEAKER_24]: That providing after reports of what happened and why when ice has been in the community is a place that we can start in providing the accountability and transparency and good communication from Medford Police Department to the city council and to more of the Medford community because this is I think what part of what the community is clamoring for.

2559
04:13:28,513 --> 04:13:34,818
[SPEAKER_24]: In this resolution, we're not asking Medford Police Department to spread the word whenever they hear that ICE is coming to town.

2560
04:13:34,858 --> 04:13:37,821
[SPEAKER_24]: We know that sometimes they get advance warning and sometimes they don't.

2561
04:13:38,521 --> 04:13:46,007
[SPEAKER_24]: This is just asking for them to be transparent with us and with the community about when ICE has been in the area and why and what they know about it.

2562
04:13:46,047 --> 04:13:55,275
[SPEAKER_24]: And like Councilor Lazzaro said, we know that sometimes the answers to those questions are going to be, we don't have a lot of information, fine, but let's make sure that there's a structure for being in regular communication about it.

2563
04:13:56,568 --> 04:14:00,330
[SPEAKER_24]: because certainly people in the community are seeing this happen.

2564
04:14:00,991 --> 04:14:02,211
[SPEAKER_24]: People are being affected by it.

2565
04:14:02,311 --> 04:14:05,173
[SPEAKER_24]: People are being arrested and detained and abducted.

2566
04:14:05,193 --> 04:14:08,714
[SPEAKER_24]: And this is scary.

2567
04:14:08,915 --> 04:14:10,335
[SPEAKER_24]: And this is not in line with our values.

2568
04:14:10,535 --> 04:14:12,036
[SPEAKER_24]: And this is a threat to our public safety.

2569
04:14:12,696 --> 04:14:21,421
[SPEAKER_24]: So I welcome collaboration with our public safety officials and at least trying to shed some light into this

2570
04:14:23,926 --> 04:14:30,071
[SPEAKER_24]: very scary, opaque and fascistic use of federal law enforcement in our community.

2571
04:14:30,692 --> 04:14:30,972
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2572
04:14:30,992 --> 04:14:31,772
[SPEAKER_24]: A motion to approve.

2573
04:14:32,973 --> 04:14:37,297
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you on the motion approved by Vice President Collins seconded by second.

2574
04:14:38,658 --> 04:14:39,639
[SPEAKER_35]: We'll go to Councilor Leming.

2575
04:14:42,201 --> 04:14:49,547
[SPEAKER_29]: One thing I did just want to do with my with my time is that the arrest was actually recorded

2576
04:14:50,683 --> 04:14:52,164
[SPEAKER_29]: by one of the neighbors.

2577
04:14:52,484 --> 04:14:58,287
[SPEAKER_29]: And so I'm going to try to get a clip of this that doesn't get the guy's face too closely.

2578
04:14:58,467 --> 04:15:06,070
[SPEAKER_29]: But I do feel like these arrests are usually a little bit abstract, like people only just talk about them.

2579
04:15:06,170 --> 04:15:15,795
[SPEAKER_29]: And in this case, there was a couple of ICE agents who were arresting a pizza delivery driver, which I don't really think is that great of a

2580
04:15:16,762 --> 04:15:24,084
[SPEAKER_29]: use of anybody's time if they're trying to stop, they're trying to protect the community.

2581
04:15:24,844 --> 04:15:30,906
[SPEAKER_29]: But it's a little silly, but I do think that a picture is worth a thousand words.

2582
04:15:31,126 --> 04:15:40,269
[SPEAKER_29]: And this really scared the neighbors who were here earlier tonight, but had to leave when they wanted to talk about this.

2583
04:15:40,409 --> 04:15:45,030
[SPEAKER_29]: And I do just like to have people see a little bit of this

2584
04:15:46,601 --> 04:15:53,644
[SPEAKER_29]: see a little bit of the footage just so that it's not quite as abstract as it normally is when we're just talking about an arrest over the weekend.

2585
04:15:53,664 --> 04:15:56,885
[SPEAKER_29]: So thank you for listening.

2586
04:15:58,926 --> 04:16:09,170
[SPEAKER_29]: And I'm not going to, again, I'm not going to show the whole clip because I did realize that in some places it shows a close-up of his face and I decided I didn't really want to do that.

2587
04:16:12,501 --> 04:16:13,241
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you, Councilor Leming.

2588
04:16:13,261 --> 04:16:16,363
[SPEAKER_35]: Any further discussion by members of the Council on this resolution?

2589
04:16:16,383 --> 04:16:23,767
[SPEAKER_35]: On the motion of Vice President Collins to approve, seconded by Councilor Lazzaro, is there any public participation on this resolution?

2590
04:16:27,354 --> 04:16:30,136
[SPEAKER_35]: Yes, name and address for the record, please.

2591
04:16:30,176 --> 04:16:31,057
[SPEAKER_35]: And you'll have three minutes.

2592
04:16:31,077 --> 04:16:33,339
[SPEAKER_06]: Adriana Zavala-Penziner, West Medford.

2593
04:16:34,140 --> 04:16:42,347
[SPEAKER_06]: I simply wanna say that I wasn't directly witness to this, but it was around the corner from me and I was on the text chat that conveyed that this was happening.

2594
04:16:43,308 --> 04:16:53,216
[SPEAKER_06]: And seeing this after having seen what happened to the Tufts University student, we should be terrified because the people who arrested this pizza delivery driver

2595
04:16:54,397 --> 04:16:55,757
[SPEAKER_06]: would not identify themselves.

2596
04:16:55,937 --> 04:17:00,458
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of them was wearing a flak jacket that said police, but it was not Medford police.

2597
04:17:01,058 --> 04:17:05,799
[SPEAKER_06]: So my approach will be to call 911 when I see this happen again.

2598
04:17:06,520 --> 04:17:10,860
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is happening all over the country and it's now happening in Medford.

2599
04:17:10,920 --> 04:17:12,801
[SPEAKER_06]: So we wanted people to be aware of it.

2600
04:17:13,021 --> 04:17:13,701
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

2601
04:17:16,402 --> 04:17:16,842
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you.

2602
04:17:20,822 --> 04:17:23,203
[SPEAKER_35]: Any further discussion by members of the public on this resolution?

2603
04:17:27,132 --> 04:17:28,833
[SPEAKER_35]: Seeing none, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2604
04:17:30,254 --> 04:17:31,315

[SPEAKER_35]: Oh, what?

2623

2625
