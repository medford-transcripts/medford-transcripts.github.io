1
00:00:06,612 --> 00:00:11,094
Good afternoon, this is Stephanie Muccini-Burke, and I'm here from the mayor's office at Medford City Hall.

2
00:00:11,274 --> 00:00:12,814
Thank you so much for tuning in today.

3
00:00:12,834 --> 00:00:16,836
I'm pleased to introduce you to one of the transition teams that we had in place.

4
00:00:17,216 --> 00:00:19,497
It's the economic development transition team.

5
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:34,283
They spent quite a bit of time over the course of the last several months meeting with the businesses and residents throughout our community in the various squares in order to bring forth a plan called Shaping Medford, which we're really proud to highlight today.

6
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:42,574
We'll give you a brief report on the comprehensive committee work called Shaping Medfin and some of the initiatives that we already have in place today.

7
00:00:43,154 --> 00:00:48,258
The Business and Economic Development Committee is one of four teams that I put in place shortly after being elected.

8
00:00:48,618 --> 00:00:54,001
We had the City Hall Audit Team, the Cultural Affairs and Recreation Team, as well as the Constituent Service Team.

9
00:00:54,822 --> 00:01:04,108
Behind me are committee members for the Business and Economic Development Committee, which was led by Co-Chair Rick Orlando, Co-Chair Fred DelaRusso, President of the City Council,

10
00:01:04,705 --> 00:01:12,246
Members Muhammad Chowdhury, Christine Cousineau, Paul Matarazzo, Kelly Herstack, Tim McGibbon, and Linda Garriott.

11
00:01:12,806 --> 00:01:21,388
I'd like to thank these committee members for taking part in this experiment and for their expertise and the commitment of time that they put forth.

12
00:01:21,788 --> 00:01:27,309
They met countless hours with some of the residents in the community to try and bring forth the best plan possible.

13
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:29,690
So they gave up quite a bit of their personal time.

14
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:31,510
And for that, I'm very appreciative to all of you.

15
00:01:32,557 --> 00:01:37,858
Further, this report would not have been possible without the community members that took part in all of these meetings.

16
00:01:38,279 --> 00:01:49,422
We try to value your input and hopefully when we come back out and meet with you, you'll see what has come from all of the discussions that were taking place along small tables and large conference rooms.

17
00:01:50,202 --> 00:01:57,004
It's an important time in Medford with an influx of new residents, businesses, and nationwide focus on walkability and placemaking.

18
00:01:57,564 --> 00:02:01,245
My administration is dedicated to making strides to enhance Medford's

19
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:04,308
appeal as a place to live, play, and work.

20
00:02:05,029 --> 00:02:07,851
Economic and business development are at the heart of this effort.

21
00:02:08,511 --> 00:02:19,960
And this committee was key to providing detailed and geographically specific feedback that will guide the many important conversations and initiatives currently taking place and future initiatives that will take place.

22
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:28,706
At this point, I'd like to introduce Rick Orlando, the co-chair of the committee, who will provide a little bit of information on the process and some of the basic findings of the report.

23
00:02:30,547 --> 00:02:31,108
Mr. Orlando.

24
00:02:32,617 --> 00:02:36,278
Thank you, Mayor, for the introduction and the opportunity to be part of the community effort.

25
00:02:36,658 --> 00:02:40,258
My name is Rick Orlando, and I would like to also thank the individuals on the committee.

26
00:02:41,359 --> 00:02:52,921
They not only gave their time, but what we found was that this committee and the report benefited significantly because of their extensive professional experience in city planning and urban development.

27
00:02:53,441 --> 00:02:55,641
Thank you, Mayor, for making those excellent committee choices.

28
00:02:56,421 --> 00:03:01,342
I would recommend that anybody reading the report take a quick look at the section that briefly describes their backgrounds.

29
00:03:02,497 --> 00:03:08,519
The report is a comprehensive compilation of regional, city-wide information and local inputs.

30
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:14,401
The committee conducted a series of meetings, as noted, one for each of the squares located throughout Medford.

31
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:21,183
The basis for the recommendation is grounded in the resident, business owner, and property owner inputs from those five meetings.

32
00:03:21,944 --> 00:03:32,047
The meetings were supported by the Chamber of Commerce, and specifically the chamber representatives from each of the squares, George Thurow, Fred De La Russo, Steve Papio, Anthony Pereira,

33
00:03:32,561 --> 00:03:34,522
Dominic Camara, and John Veneziano.

34
00:03:35,223 --> 00:03:40,087
These individuals provided communications on the upcoming meetings to get the word out and drive up the attendance.

35
00:03:40,487 --> 00:03:47,952
There were approximately 40 to 60 attendees at each of these meetings, and the representatives were also extremely helpful during the meetings themselves.

36
00:03:48,913 --> 00:03:57,940
A brief explanation of the process the committee used would be useful in emphasizing how important the resident business owners and property owners' inputs were.

37
00:03:58,616 --> 00:04:01,999
The meeting format used multiple teams of 17 people in groups.

38
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:06,584
The meetings were significantly focused on the attendees rather than presentation by us.

39
00:04:07,565 --> 00:04:13,791
These groups were able to then provide a wide range of inputs, suggestions, concerns and hopes for their city.

40
00:04:14,812 --> 00:04:19,416
The maps were provided to each one of them, which they then extensively marked up and

41
00:04:25,272 --> 00:04:27,213
We then, the committee, we collected these maps.

42
00:04:27,713 --> 00:04:35,596
There were a combination, there was perhaps over 30 square maps we had and over 700 inputs that came as a result of these five meetings.

43
00:04:37,337 --> 00:04:47,040
And I think I can say with confidence that the meetings were informative and fun, actually, both not only the members on the committee, but actually the attendees.

44
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:53,062
And people that attended very much appreciated being asked to participate in this.

45
00:04:54,088 --> 00:05:01,710
The committee organized those many inputs, the 700 or so, into countless hours of putting them on spreadsheets and understanding what all the raw data was telling us.

46
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:07,731
The report with all of those details will be on the website shortly following this press release.

47
00:05:08,751 --> 00:05:18,833
The categories that had the highest number of comments were street side improvements, vehicular, pedestrian and bike circulation, and safety for both pedestrians and cyclists.

48
00:05:19,599 --> 00:05:28,306
Business development and marketing was also another high point for some of the squares, and new development of a construction nature for mixed-use development.

49
00:05:29,067 --> 00:05:35,152
The organized inputs were then analyzed for paths of common needs or unique interests in these various square streets.

50
00:05:35,692 --> 00:05:41,677
Streetscape improvements in safety were the common in four of the five squares.

51
00:05:42,118 --> 00:05:46,942
However, Medford Square was different from the other squares in that it was clearly asking for a focus on development.

52
00:05:48,303 --> 00:05:53,147
This was the form of mixed-use retail and residential in the immediate square area.

53
00:05:53,948 --> 00:06:02,355
We also saw that a number of years ago come out of the Sykes-Sasaki plan, which also emphasized that point as one of the main drivers for Medford Square's redevelopment.

54
00:06:03,256 --> 00:06:06,739
Physical changes on walkability were also another high point for Medford Square.

55
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:13,605
All the details, community inputs, et cetera, recommendations can again be found on the website once the report is posted.

56
00:06:14,072 --> 00:06:22,454
And the report does start off with an executive summary, which you can read through to see what the full report, which is, I think, somewhere around 70 pages, will provide.

57
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:30,615
In addition to gathered data and recommendations on the individual squares, the committee cited content from previous studies, which are still useful and relevant today.

58
00:06:30,975 --> 00:06:40,657
There was also information and recommendation on citywide patents and other emerging business districts beyond the five squares, such as the Wellington Circle area, the Mystic Ave corridor,

59
00:06:41,721 --> 00:06:48,227
and the East Medford commercial area that you would probably recognize along Route 16 and Locust Street.

60
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:56,134
The committee did set its sights high and provided major citywide recommendations including Route 16 changes, Clippership Drive changes,

61
00:06:56,643 --> 00:07:02,110
and even land swaps for some of the state and federal properties in the city.

62
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:06,516
Those were obviously to be investigated with the appropriate state and federal agencies.

63
00:07:07,117 --> 00:07:11,984
The report also includes recommendations on the availability of state-level resources and programs.

64
00:07:12,834 --> 00:07:25,137
Mayor Stephanie Luchine-Burke has already been working with the state and those agencies on a number of these resources and will be providing updates on positive progress to complement the city's efforts in improving the downtown and other squares.

65
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:30,319
The mayor will also be outlining a number of activities and actions to help with the implementation of this program.

66
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:39,201
In closing, it is key to understand that development has already started in Medford and will continue due to market conditions and private sector activity.

67
00:07:39,577 --> 00:07:49,946
The challenge, the city's challenge is to influence and guide the coming changes to create the desired outcomes for Medford residents and what they've been providing us inputs on.

68
00:07:50,427 --> 00:07:53,349
I saw recently a quote that I think is very relevant.

69
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:58,954
Let us not be content to wait and see what will happen, but give us the determination to make the right things happen.

70
00:08:05,795 --> 00:08:06,736
Thank you so much, Rick.

71
00:08:07,096 --> 00:08:16,205
I think when people take the time and read the report, they're going to be astounded by some of the ideas that came from these various community business district meetings.

72
00:08:16,685 --> 00:08:19,728
And there really are some fabulous ideas, really out-of-the-box ideas.

73
00:08:19,788 --> 00:08:22,631
So I thank you all for bringing it all together for us.

74
00:08:23,935 --> 00:08:27,759
To follow up on this report over the next two months, we plan on bringing it to the streets.

75
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:39,989
So we plan on revisiting the sections of the city to bring people back to the table so that they can hear the outcomes from all of their comments and to see the next steps that the city plans on taking in order to initiate some of these grand ideas.

76
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:44,373
Also, I'm pleased to say that we're moving forward with some very important initiatives.

77
00:08:44,693 --> 00:08:49,297
You heard Rick speak about safety and crosswalks and bike accessibility issues.

78
00:08:49,954 --> 00:08:52,696
So we do have several initiatives that are on the front right now.

79
00:08:52,716 --> 00:08:57,759
One is the complete streets process, which our city engineer will be speaking about shortly.

80
00:08:58,319 --> 00:09:01,261
Medford Square revitalization plan.

81
00:09:02,002 --> 00:09:08,526
Releasing a business guide to help new businesses navigate the different requirements and permits that are required to open up their shop.

82
00:09:09,206 --> 00:09:13,529
Strengthening our relationship with the chamber, which we think is at the forefront that we need to do.

83
00:09:14,209 --> 00:09:16,611
And other business coalitions that are throughout the community.

84
00:09:17,081 --> 00:09:20,303
and exploring ways to actively invite businesses to Medford.

85
00:09:20,423 --> 00:09:29,168
And one of the key aspects of that is we were able, with the City Council's vote for appropriation this past June, to add two new positions to the Office of Community Development.

86
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:33,870
We think that is vital to initiating and bringing some of these ideas forward.

87
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:42,615
So we look forward to bringing on these new staff positions and seeing the work that they will do to help the Office of Community Development flourish.

88
00:09:43,234 --> 00:09:45,516
With that being said, I'd like to introduce Lauren DiLorenzo.

89
00:09:45,576 --> 00:09:48,078
She is the Director of our Office of Community Development.

90
00:09:48,398 --> 00:09:54,383
She's gonna speak a little bit about the Method Square process that really is the jumping off from all the work that these fine people behind me did.

91
00:09:54,963 --> 00:09:56,424
And Lauren, if you could step forward.

92
00:09:56,444 --> 00:10:01,288
Thank you, Mayor Burke.

93
00:10:02,812 --> 00:10:12,475
Briefly I'd like to update you on the status of activities that we've been working on with the city administration and consultants that we've had to implement some improvements in Medford Square.

94
00:10:12,755 --> 00:10:18,456
Some of these have been ongoing activities and others are projected to really move full force this fall.

95
00:10:18,937 --> 00:10:22,197
The first is a little bit of an update on the Medford Square Master Plan.

96
00:10:23,158 --> 00:10:27,619
I've decided to rephrase this, the Medford Square Master Plan, rather than calling a

97
00:10:28,533 --> 00:10:40,319
really an update, it really is time for a new master plan and there is really no reason to do anything other than pull goals and objectives and ideas from the past and from the committee behind me and move forward.

98
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:45,082
So I'd like to propose that we don't call this an update anymore of Medford Square Master Plan.

99
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:55,528
This is a new master plan for Medford Square with participation by residents and businesses who are in the community now under the guidance of the Metropolitan Area Planning Council.

100
00:10:56,377 --> 00:11:01,341
Worked with them, we've received $90,000 of funding in order to complete this master plan.

101
00:11:02,122 --> 00:11:22,218
We had one input meeting earlier in the spring, and over the summer, the staff of the Office of Community Development, along with the Metropolitan Area Planning Council, have met with a number of stakeholders to receive their comments, their input about what they feel is necessary to enliven Medford Square, bring additional business, and improve safety and connectivity.

102
00:11:23,255 --> 00:11:32,219
The project is going to focus on some areas that have been identified with input by the groups that have met previously.

103
00:11:32,599 --> 00:11:41,083
And they're going to include economic development, vitality, really making Medford Square lively more than just in the morning or the afternoon hours, but to extend that into the evening.

104
00:11:41,644 --> 00:11:48,607
Land use, you know, the land uses are a mixed use in Medford Square as they are, but it's time for an update based on the current economic conditions.

105
00:11:49,226 --> 00:11:56,168
transportation, connectivity, open space, and then the land use regulations in order to implement the goals and objectives that will be established.

106
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:02,050
The planning process will really be moving now that we're going into the fall.

107
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:06,872
And the first community forum will be held on September 7th in the city council chambers.

108
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:08,532
So we invite everybody to participate.

109
00:12:08,792 --> 00:12:10,753
We welcome your comments and we hope you can attend.

110
00:12:10,773 --> 00:12:12,914
If you can't, you can email comments to us.

111
00:12:12,934 --> 00:12:14,734
You can send them in writing or give us a call.

112
00:12:14,754 --> 00:12:16,155
We'd be happy to consider your comments.

113
00:12:17,407 --> 00:12:19,807
And an update on a couple of other items that we've been working on.

114
00:12:20,888 --> 00:12:22,328
It's called the Riverside Plaza.

115
00:12:22,348 --> 00:12:25,949
Someday they may have a name for this with the area in front of the Salem Street Burying Ground.

116
00:12:26,289 --> 00:12:39,411
It's also another area that we've been focusing on in terms of open space and connectivity issues and to also provide a stage for performance in art and bringing that goal of increasing vitality in Medford Square.

117
00:12:39,871 --> 00:12:45,132
So a number of us have been working on this concept and the idea to spend some meetings with art groups

118
00:12:45,836 --> 00:12:50,665
And we expect to hear shortly whether or not we've received the grant that we have applied for.

119
00:12:50,685 --> 00:12:52,048
We applied for $250,000 land and water conservation.

120
00:12:55,069 --> 00:13:01,991
grant would be matched with $250,000 of other sources of funding, and we expect to hear that announcement very shortly.

121
00:13:02,451 --> 00:13:05,512
We have a landscape architect engaged currently.

122
00:13:05,772 --> 00:13:22,577
We've had meetings starting in anticipation of hearing about this grant funding announcement, and we will be moving ahead on improvements and design, schematic design, programming, and construction of improvements to the area in front of the Salem Street Barrier Ground, which is currently called the Riverside Plaza.

123
00:13:23,933 --> 00:13:30,119
Just a very quick update, there have been a number of other ongoing projects that have been under construction and they're nearing completion.

124
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:35,344
Basically, there has been probably $2.1 million worth of improvements.

125
00:13:35,684 --> 00:13:45,754
Some of them look like they may be unrelated to Medford Square and the idea of an overall master plan, but the fact is they are to improve the social and recreational activities that we have.

126
00:13:46,612 --> 00:13:54,397
at the senior center, over a million and a half dollars has been invested with CDB federal, CDBG grant funds to upgrade the conditions at the senior center.

127
00:13:54,738 --> 00:13:55,818
That's nearing completion.

128
00:13:56,099 --> 00:14:03,584
And in front of that, the Crystal Campbell Peace Garden, which is over another million dollars of other sources of funding that we've gathered through grants and donations.

129
00:14:04,084 --> 00:14:12,170
And each of these projects, while they may have some other purpose, like providing services to seniors, or commemorating the bombing victims,

130
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,401
of the Boston Marathon, but they also link into other plans.

131
00:14:16,741 --> 00:14:26,303
They will link into Riverside Plaza to create the walkability of the downtown area and improve the experience, improve the open space connections to the Mystic River.

132
00:14:26,343 --> 00:14:31,785
So those are the projects that we've been working on this summer, and I hope that you'll see them complete this fall.

133
00:14:32,425 --> 00:14:32,905
Very good.

134
00:14:32,925 --> 00:14:33,405
Thank you, Lauren.

135
00:14:37,442 --> 00:14:44,966
Also, one of the first initiatives we undertook upon being sworn in was signing on to the community compact with the Governor's office.

136
00:14:45,366 --> 00:14:51,030
Lieutenant Governor Perlito did come out and meet with us and we signed the compact together in this office a few months ago.

137
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:56,232
And the item that Lauren just spoke about, the Medford Square Master Plan, was part of

138
00:14:58,016 --> 00:14:59,919
agreement that we made with the Commonwealth of Mass.

139
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:03,364
So we thank them for being a party in all the work that we're doing.

140
00:15:03,765 --> 00:15:07,370
And the next initiative that we undertook was a complete streets policy initiative.

141
00:15:07,851 --> 00:15:10,194
And Cassandra is going to update us on that right now.

142
00:15:10,294 --> 00:15:12,758
Thank you, Cassandra Kudlitas, City Engineer.

143
00:15:14,085 --> 00:15:14,906
Thank you, Mary Burke.

144
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:16,127
Good afternoon, everybody.

145
00:15:16,147 --> 00:15:19,469
So how do we get to all these wonderful places, you might ask.

146
00:15:19,529 --> 00:15:21,711
Well, you need streets and sidewalks.

147
00:15:22,011 --> 00:15:32,419
And one of the things that we're working on that I think beautifully dovetails with all of the work that the committee and other folks are doing is to push forward the Complete Streets initiative.

148
00:15:32,479 --> 00:15:36,662
And a complete street is a street that is meant to be safe and accessible for everybody.

149
00:15:37,423 --> 00:15:41,046
So since we signed the community compact, we have been working very hard.

150
00:15:41,595 --> 00:15:47,484
We put out a complete streets policy that was sent to the state and scored, and we got a very high score, almost 100.

151
00:15:49,126 --> 00:15:51,930
It would have been over 100, but they don't give more than 100.

152
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:55,796
We also developed a working group, an ad hoc working group, and came up with a

153
00:15:56,677 --> 00:16:09,721
prioritization plan, which meant we reached out and gathered dozens of projects that people came up with and we used the services of the MAPC, Metropolitan Area Planning Council, to help us try to winnow it down.

154
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:17,244
We went out and looked at a number of different locations and prepared concept sheets in which we took 20 of these projects and submitted it to the state.

155
00:16:17,884 --> 00:16:21,245
So that was done this summer in what's called a prioritization plan.

156
00:16:21,645 --> 00:16:26,027
The state read it, approved it, and gave us permission to go on to the next step,

157
00:16:26,587 --> 00:16:27,848
which is a request for funding.

158
00:16:27,908 --> 00:16:51,018
So from the prioritization plan, we came up with about six projects, and just to let you know briefly what they are, we're looking at pedestrian enhancements at the Brooks Elementary School on High Street, pedestrian enhancements in West Medford Square, also in Medford Square on Salem Street, where the crossing of Ashland and River can be quite difficult for people with three lanes of traffic going at high speeds sometimes.

159
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:53,819
We're going to create a curb extension that will allow for

160
00:16:54,309 --> 00:16:56,570
visibility and for shortening that crosswalk.

161
00:16:57,210 --> 00:17:02,592
We're looking at a project that would have bike lanes on Boston Avenue which is an important element for commuters.

162
00:17:03,352 --> 00:17:18,337
And we're looking at the interchange of Medford Street and Main Street where Tufts School and Park is so we can have improved pedestrian crossings there, maybe some changes in the parking layout to make it more safe and more appropriate for cars pulling in and out.

163
00:17:19,034 --> 00:17:20,575
And I think that's about it.

164
00:17:20,635 --> 00:17:21,776
Let me just check my notes.

165
00:17:22,116 --> 00:17:24,818
Oh, Winthrop Circle, how could I forget?

166
00:17:25,258 --> 00:17:34,824
So we're going to be bringing Winthrop Circle up to current standards for signs and striping so that we meet what is called the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control.

167
00:17:34,904 --> 00:17:41,668
So that is something that's a real safety improvement for, as well, pedestrians, cyclists, and of course, motorists.

168
00:17:42,209 --> 00:17:44,730
So with that, I will turn it over to you.

169
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:45,891
Thank you very much, Cassandra.

170
00:17:49,477 --> 00:17:58,340
I'm just really proud to say that the projects that Cassandra just spoke about, they amount to about $400,000, and they've been funded through the Complete Streets grant program.

171
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:10,265
So we're really, really pleased that the governor's office and DOT, they've all approved our plans, and the hard work that Cassandra and her office have done, as well as the bike commission and the pedestrian committee.

172
00:18:10,445 --> 00:18:17,187
A lot of people have put their thoughts into some of the ideas that now will be done in the near future.

173
00:18:17,267 --> 00:18:19,008
So we're really happy with the

174
00:18:19,827 --> 00:18:25,528
citizen engagement, and the way that people are willing to give up their time to make Medford a better community.

175
00:18:25,568 --> 00:18:27,148
So we're really proud of those two aspects.

176
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:30,449
Next, I have Allie Fisk from our office.

177
00:18:30,929 --> 00:18:32,509
She is our business liaison.

178
00:18:32,609 --> 00:18:42,451
She's been working very closely with the Chamber of Commerce, some of the people behind me here, and a host of other cultural and arts people in our community.

179
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:47,312
She wants to bring you up to date on a business guide that was one of our priority items back in January.

180
00:18:47,872 --> 00:18:49,092
And Allie, take it away.

181
00:18:52,802 --> 00:18:53,582
Thank you Mayor Burke.

182
00:18:54,783 --> 00:19:10,090
So frequent feedback from the community of individuals and businesses as well as the business and economic development report have indicated that there is a desire for a business guide to help individuals navigate the system of creating and starting a new business in Medford.

183
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:14,471
So we are pleased to say that we have one that will be released within the next couple of weeks.

184
00:19:14,972 --> 00:19:22,675
And what this guide does is it walks individuals through the different steps needed to open a business and that can cover things such as how to obtain a business certificate,

185
00:19:23,062 --> 00:19:29,585
how to obtain permits to get renovations on the building, how to sell food or alcohol in your business.

186
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:31,245
So it's very comprehensive.

187
00:19:31,265 --> 00:19:41,549
Once the business owner's pointed in the right direction, which is what the guide is meant to do, then it's up to the individual departments to help the businesses from there in successfully launching their business.

188
00:19:41,629 --> 00:19:45,011
So that will be coming out shortly, both online and in print.

189
00:19:45,571 --> 00:19:47,092
So do stay tuned for that.

190
00:19:47,892 --> 00:19:50,453
And also, as the mayor said, we are working very hard to

191
00:19:50,969 --> 00:19:58,610
strengthen the partnership between the mayor's office, the city of Medford, department heads, and the Chamber of Commerce and other business associations.

192
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:07,232
They are integral to business and economic development in Medford, and so we are making sure that they are a big part of conversations about new initiatives.

193
00:20:07,552 --> 00:20:16,593
We are attending meetings together, attending government affairs meetings of the Chamber of Commerce, just to make sure that they're part of the conversation and we're part of their conversations as well.

194
00:20:16,773 --> 00:20:20,314
So we think everything that the business associations are doing in Medford and our

195
00:20:20,784 --> 00:20:24,537
excited to keep working with them to move all of these initiatives forward.

196
00:20:25,159 --> 00:20:25,461
Thank you.

197
00:20:29,138 --> 00:20:30,239
Thank you very much, Allie.

198
00:20:30,919 --> 00:20:41,644
A lot of work has gone into that, and we do have a good draft that we have circulated to a few business owners from the chamber, and also some of the newer businesses that just opened up.

199
00:20:41,664 --> 00:20:42,965
We wanted to get their feedback.

200
00:20:43,005 --> 00:20:44,766
They've just gone through the entire process.

201
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:53,490
We wanted to see what made sense and the sequencing of doing things, so we're very eager to get their input over the course of the next week, and then it will go to publication.

202
00:20:53,950 --> 00:21:02,877
So thank you very much, Ally, for spearheading that and we're just really, really proud of the work that the department heads are doing on behalf of the citizens of Medford and the business owners in this city.

203
00:21:03,838 --> 00:21:09,742
Just before I leave you, I just wanted to bring you up to date on a couple of events that will be taking place over the next two months.

204
00:21:10,543 --> 00:21:16,608
September 25th at 2 p.m., we will be unveiling the Crystal Campbell Peace Garden that Lauren DiLorenzo spoke of earlier.

205
00:21:17,028 --> 00:21:22,132
We're very excited to show that location, the peacefulness, the tranquility.

206
00:21:22,527 --> 00:21:27,958
and to pay our respects for those that lost their lives or that are suffering to this day from the bombing accident.

207
00:21:28,966 --> 00:21:32,468
Also, on October 23rd at 1 o'clock, we will be having Medford Day.

208
00:21:33,189 --> 00:21:34,429
This is a community day.

209
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:43,135
We envision it highlighting the diversity of our community, the many multi-cultures that traverse our streets and take part in our school systems and dance and music.

210
00:21:43,515 --> 00:21:45,396
So we're very excited to have that.

211
00:21:45,456 --> 00:21:48,098
And we'll be behind the Andrews Middle School once again.

212
00:21:48,118 --> 00:21:56,943
But we're very eager, so if you have any interest in playing a role in that day, reach out to the mayor's office and we'll certainly get back to you and organize your event.

213
00:21:57,323 --> 00:21:59,646
help to allow you to participate in that day.

214
00:22:00,066 --> 00:22:00,947
So thank you very much.

215
00:22:01,027 --> 00:22:05,132
On behalf of the whole mayor's staff, I thank the committee members for all of their hard work.

216
00:22:05,152 --> 00:22:09,617
They're a fabulous group, very articulate, very educated, very invested.

217
00:22:10,177 --> 00:22:12,640
And without them, we could not have done the work that we did.

218
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:17,205
So thank you very much for participating, and we look forward to working with you into the future.

219
00:22:17,385 --> 00:22:18,066
Thank you very much.
