23
00:00:53,081 --> 00:01:02,707
[SPEAKER_17]: Be it so resolved, the Medford City Council hold a moment of silence in his honor, and be it further resolved that the evening's Medford City Council meeting be dedicated to his memory.

24
00:01:02,807 --> 00:01:03,287
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Knight.

25
00:01:03,707 --> 00:01:04,908
[SPEAKER_04]: Madam President, thank you very much.

26
00:01:04,968 --> 00:01:09,172
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is a resolution that I've been fortunate enough to put forward each year since my election.

27
00:01:09,392 --> 00:01:11,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Charlie Sheeran was a great mentor to me.

28
00:01:11,433 --> 00:01:20,801
[SPEAKER_04]: The first big boy job I had when I was in college was working as an intern in the senator's office and that turned into what seems to be a lifetime in politics now.

29
00:01:20,821 --> 00:01:23,483
[SPEAKER_04]: But I couldn't have done it without the guidance and leadership of Charlie Sheeran.

30
00:01:24,023 --> 00:01:34,846
[SPEAKER_04]: And Charlie represented the city of Medford with great pride and great diligence, Madam President, he served as our state senator from 1990 to 2005 when he passed as a result of battle with cancer.

31
00:01:35,647 --> 00:01:37,827
[SPEAKER_04]: Charlie was a US Army veteran.

32
00:01:38,267 --> 00:01:42,849
[SPEAKER_04]: He was a retired police officer, and he was a career public servant.

33
00:01:44,774 --> 00:01:52,980
[SPEAKER_04]: When we look around the city of Medford, we see some of the things that remind us of the work that Charlie did, and we look around the second Middlesex district we see some of the things that Charlie did.

34
00:01:54,041 --> 00:02:02,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Shannon Beach for example is named after Senator Shannon, in honor of all the work that he's done in restoring Route 16 in the Mystic Valley Parkway.

35
00:02:03,188 --> 00:02:20,122
[SPEAKER_04]: So when I think back to my time with Senator Shannon and what was going on in his office during the time that I worked there, I talk about things like marriage equality, we talk about health care for all, we talk about the Green Line extension, these are great things, great issues that really made a difference in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and in the residents in this community's life.

36
00:02:20,803 --> 00:02:23,425
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was very fortunate to have the opportunity to work and learn from Charlie.

37
00:02:24,026 --> 00:02:26,408
[SPEAKER_04]: Another item that we're going to talk about I'm sure down the line will be

38
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:40,699
[SPEAKER_04]: and the roof of La Conte skating rink was fallen in, it was Senator Shannon who was able to secure the funds to be sure that La Conte skating rink was repaired, refurbished, and maintained so that we can still enjoy it to this day.

39
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:50,266
[SPEAKER_04]: So Madam President, it's with a heavy heart that I offer this resolution once again, but it's something that I feel is necessary to be sure that we in this community don't forget somebody that did so much for us.

40
00:02:51,127 --> 00:02:53,829
[SPEAKER_04]: So I ask my council colleagues in joining me in supporting this resolution.

41
00:02:54,369 --> 00:02:55,030
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

42
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,111
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Carviello.

43
00:02:56,131 --> 00:02:56,891
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Madam President.

44
00:02:58,045 --> 00:03:04,111
[SPEAKER_02]: Charlie Shannon was both a friend to my family and a mentor to me.

45
00:03:04,411 --> 00:03:09,316
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably one of the reasons I'm sitting here tonight is because he taught me government is about people.

46
00:03:10,137 --> 00:03:21,028
[SPEAKER_02]: And as Councilor Knight mentioned, my first encounter with Senator Shannon was when I was president of the Hockey Association and the MDC was going to condemn the rink.

47
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:24,912
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I couldn't get anybody to help me, I never knew Senator Shannon.

48
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:29,214
[SPEAKER_02]: I went to him, and he was able to secure the funding to keep the building open.

49
00:03:29,254 --> 00:03:31,235
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we have a skating rink today if it wasn't for him.

50
00:03:31,736 --> 00:03:34,337
[SPEAKER_02]: But he was a good man, came from a good family.

51
00:03:34,697 --> 00:03:36,078
[SPEAKER_02]: He did a lot for this community.

52
00:03:36,718 --> 00:03:41,161
[SPEAKER_02]: And if he didn't get sick, maybe he'd still be around as our senator.

53
00:03:41,561 --> 00:03:47,964
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just wanted to say, my son worked for him for many years, along with Councilor Knight.

54
00:03:48,345 --> 00:03:48,785
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah.

55
00:03:51,377 --> 00:03:56,460
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so let's say a lot of people, a lot of people that worked in his office went on to bigger things.

56
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,402
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's a good thing.

57
00:03:58,442 --> 00:04:01,784
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we could dedicate this meeting in his memory, it'd be appreciated.

58
00:04:02,544 --> 00:04:03,365
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councillor Carville.

59
00:04:04,946 --> 00:04:06,087
[SPEAKER_17]: Please rise for a moment of silence.

60
00:04:18,032 --> 00:04:24,075

113
00:07:37,157 --> 00:07:38,498
[SPEAKER_17]: Please give us a brief overview.

114
00:07:38,939 --> 00:07:40,660
[SPEAKER_01]: Bill Lucas with bowler engineering.

115
00:07:41,982 --> 00:07:44,985
[SPEAKER_01]: Briefly, I just wanted to back up to the history of the project.

116
00:07:45,025 --> 00:07:49,369
[SPEAKER_01]: We received a permit refusal from the building commissioner on January 12 2023.

117
00:07:51,579 --> 00:08:07,947
[SPEAKER_01]: The permit refusal noted proposed drive-through window for a bank use in a commercial 2C-2 zoning district, which then requires a special permit from section F-4, table use of regulations, item number F-4.

118
00:08:08,127 --> 00:08:19,253
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, we've also received a negative determination from the Conservation Commission on March 15th for the same project, and we have then made application

119
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:25,544
[SPEAKER_01]: with the City Council on March 22nd, 2023 for the special permit that you're hearing this evening.

120
00:08:26,504 --> 00:08:37,871
[SPEAKER_01]: If I can, I will share my screen quickly and give you a little bit of a presentation in terms of where the project is located and a little bit of background for it itself.

121
00:08:38,772 --> 00:08:42,454
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully everybody can see that on screen right now where it says Bank of America 3850 Mystic Valley.

122
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:45,039
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.

123
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:59,087
[SPEAKER_01]: Moving forward, the overall property is, again, 3850 Mystic Valley Parkway, which is the Meadow Glen Shopping Center, which I've depicted here in a purple-ish hue around the perimeter of the

124
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:07,758
[SPEAKER_01]: overall property and then what we're showing on that lower left-hand corner in yellow is the actual project site for the Bank of America itself.

125
00:09:08,098 --> 00:09:14,824
[SPEAKER_01]: That is on the northern end of the site in a portion of just the parking lot.

126
00:09:14,844 --> 00:09:19,149
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no existing buildings in that location as it exists today.

127
00:09:20,365 --> 00:09:24,688
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit of a zoomed-in location of that project site itself.

128
00:09:24,788 --> 00:09:28,150
[SPEAKER_01]: On the upper right-hand corner is the existing marshals.

129
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:38,537
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the parking out front of that, and then you can see in yellow again the portion of that parking lot where we're proposing the Bank of America, which is pretty much under-parked at this point in time.

130
00:09:41,432 --> 00:10:03,738
[SPEAKER_01]: A brief survey just in case we have any technical questions I can come back to that but really the meat of this is the site plan which you have before you now, which represents the proposed Bank of America, which is approximately 5400 square feet in area that is that rectangular grayish box in the middle of the plan itself, we're proposing

131
00:10:04,418 --> 00:10:22,582
[SPEAKER_01]: two-way vehicular traffic around three sides of it, that being the top, bottom, and the right hand from your viewpoint, and on the left-hand side in that gray asphalt area, what we're showing is that is the drive-through use itself.

132
00:10:22,642 --> 00:10:33,845
[SPEAKER_01]: There's two lanes there, both one-way traffic flow, so one would be for that drive-through use and the other is a bypass lane if you did not want to participate in going through that drive-through.

133
00:10:37,447 --> 00:10:39,388
[SPEAKER_01]: that is the project in itself.

134
00:10:40,088 --> 00:10:48,933
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have, you know, some architectural renderings of the building here so you can get an idea of what that looks like.

135
00:10:49,554 --> 00:10:52,535
[SPEAKER_01]: But otherwise, I can just open it up to questions at this time.

136
00:10:52,555 --> 00:10:54,056
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

137
00:10:54,076 --> 00:10:55,497
[SPEAKER_17]: We do have some questions from the councillors.

138
00:10:55,577 --> 00:10:56,318
[SPEAKER_17]: Councillor Scarpelli.

139
00:10:56,778 --> 00:10:57,258
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Bill.

140
00:10:57,678 --> 00:10:58,819
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for the presentation.

141
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,340
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that

142
00:11:01,365 --> 00:11:04,286
[SPEAKER_07]: there's not much parking in front of Bank of America as it is.

143
00:11:05,947 --> 00:11:18,973
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that the traffic study showed that there's no traffic issues or concerns, but how many automobiles would the lanes allow for the drive through?

144
00:11:19,653 --> 00:11:27,237
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I thought my first impression would be around the back of the building, but being on the side of the building with the lack of, you have handicapped parking in front,

145
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:33,297
[SPEAKER_07]: I just don't want to hinder any lines that would hinder any parking for handicap accessibility.

146
00:11:35,741 --> 00:11:35,961
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.

147
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:58,585
[SPEAKER_01]: just to give you a little bit of a hopefully you can see my hand circling that's where the ATM is from that point to the rear of the site as you wrap around to the back of the building itself it is there is no parking immediately adjacent to that so we are looking at upwards of eight

148
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:10,658
[SPEAKER_01]: vehicles that can be queued from that point back to before you then conflict with any of the proposed or existing parking that's on the site itself.

149
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:17,924
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I know what the problem is that the printing doesn't show I was I looked at it reverse so I apologize.

150
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:19,845
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I don't see it being a problem.

151
00:12:19,866 --> 00:12:20,266
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you.

152
00:12:23,421 --> 00:12:24,181
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, good.

153
00:12:24,221 --> 00:12:26,963
[SPEAKER_17]: Any other questions from the council before I open public hearing?

154
00:12:27,483 --> 00:12:33,326
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, as this is a public hearing, we will open it up to anyone who would like to speak in favor of this paper.

155
00:12:33,646 --> 00:12:36,248
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there anyone who would like to speak in favor of this paper?

156
00:12:36,728 --> 00:12:37,989
[SPEAKER_17]: Bill, you would be among those people.

157
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:42,491
[SPEAKER_17]: Would you, are you in favor of this paper?

158
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:45,673
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

159
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:49,561
[SPEAKER_17]: Great, thank you.

160
00:12:49,981 --> 00:12:53,986
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there anyone else who would like to speak in favor of this paper, either on Zoom or in person?

161
00:12:59,012 --> 00:13:01,475
[SPEAKER_17]: Seeing none, this portion of the public hearing is closed.

162
00:13:01,696 --> 00:13:05,881
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there anyone who would like to speak against this paper, either in person or on Zoom?

163
00:13:11,745 --> 00:13:14,426
[SPEAKER_17]: Seeing none portion of the public hearing is closed.

164
00:13:14,846 --> 00:13:19,647
[SPEAKER_07]: Do I have a motion from the council, I would motion to approve.

165
00:13:19,687 --> 00:13:24,849
[SPEAKER_07]: The only thing I would ask my colleagues I know that when we do special permits we asked for maybe a 90 day review.

166
00:13:26,309 --> 00:13:29,350
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that it's just protocol that we've

167
00:13:32,352 --> 00:13:33,913
[SPEAKER_07]: to approve and support this paper.

168
00:13:33,933 --> 00:13:35,154
[SPEAKER_07]: I see everything is in order.

169
00:13:35,595 --> 00:13:38,898
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't see the biggest thing in that area is traffic concerns.

170
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:40,559
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't see any traffic issues.

171
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:49,347
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I would think to improve and then again, visit any concerns if there's any issues in 90 days for a full review for full approval.

172
00:13:49,687 --> 00:13:50,027
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

173
00:13:50,267 --> 00:13:53,811
[SPEAKER_17]: And do you want to include the six day comment period or would you like to waive that?

174
00:13:54,011 --> 00:13:55,072
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to waive it if we can.

175
00:13:55,799 --> 00:14:05,024
[SPEAKER_17]: So we have a motion of process for Kelly to approve waiving the six day comment period, and add a 90 day review to that seconded by Councilor Carmelo.

176
00:14:07,025 --> 00:14:09,486
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll when you are ready.

487
00:29:02,707 --> 00:29:03,427
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, yes.

488
00:29:07,665 --> 00:29:16,693
[SPEAKER_17]: Director Hunt, do you wanna give us a brief overview of the... I'm sorry, Councilor Knight.

489
00:29:16,733 --> 00:29:17,353
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there anyone else?

490
00:29:17,413 --> 00:29:21,877
[SPEAKER_17]: Does anyone need a further explanation or are we good with the presentation?

491
00:29:22,317 --> 00:29:26,601
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, so as this is a public hearing, we will open the first part of the hearing.

492
00:29:26,861 --> 00:29:29,924
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there anyone who would like to speak in favor of this paper?

493
00:29:32,286 --> 00:29:33,307
[SPEAKER_17]: I believe I'm not.

494
00:29:33,327 --> 00:29:36,069

[SPEAKER_17]: All right, Director Hunt going to you.

497
00:29:51,383 --> 00:29:54,405
[SPEAKER_12]: Good evening, Madam President, thank you very much.

498
00:29:55,465 --> 00:30:05,410
[SPEAKER_12]: As members of the council know, but I will share for the public, the city of Medford is an entitlement community with the Federal Community Development Block Grant Program.

499
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:12,974
[SPEAKER_12]: That is because we have population over 50,000, we automatically receive these HUD funds every year.

500
00:30:12,994 --> 00:30:15,395
[SPEAKER_12]: It is a formula-based program.

501
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:18,737
[SPEAKER_12]: So the formula is based on our population size.

502
00:30:19,557 --> 00:30:24,460
[SPEAKER_12]: We have already been notified of what our allocation is for the coming fiscal year is $1,423,649.

503
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:28,202
[SPEAKER_12]: This is the 49th year of the program this is the 49th year that the city of Medford has received this funding.

504
00:30:38,387 --> 00:30:47,773
[SPEAKER_12]: I have submitted a plan, as we discussed usually the part of the plan that the council's most interested in is the funding of the public service agencies.

505
00:30:48,794 --> 00:30:57,160
[SPEAKER_12]: But I will share that we also do other projects as well with this we do housing we do public infrastructure.

506
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:01,923
[SPEAKER_12]: We do physical improvements, we do economic development.

507
00:31:02,903 --> 00:31:07,867
[SPEAKER_12]: and then we fund some planning administration costs as well with this funding.

508
00:31:09,007 --> 00:31:18,114
[SPEAKER_17]: We submit a five-year plan every year, and this is- Dr. Hunt, I did open for, are you in favor of the paper?

509
00:31:18,554 --> 00:31:21,056
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, sorry, I thought you would ask for the presentation.

510
00:31:21,076 --> 00:31:28,120
[SPEAKER_17]: No, I think actually the council is satisfied with the previous meeting, so I will just mark it.

511
00:31:28,161 --> 00:31:28,781
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you so much.

512
00:31:29,121 --> 00:31:31,343
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there anyone else who would like to speak in favor of this paper?

513
00:31:34,239 --> 00:31:36,241
[SPEAKER_17]: Seeing none, this portion of the hearing is closed.

514
00:31:36,261 --> 00:31:38,883
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there anyone who would like to speak in opposition of this paper?

515
00:31:42,146 --> 00:31:44,007
[SPEAKER_17]: Seeing none, this portion of the hearing is closed.

516
00:31:44,067 --> 00:31:44,668
[SPEAKER_17]: Do I have a motion?

517
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:51,833
[SPEAKER_17]: On a motion of Councillor Knight to approve pending me seven, I think it's six days.

518
00:31:52,334 --> 00:31:57,178
[SPEAKER_17]: The six day comment period seconded by Councillor Carviello.

519

[SPEAKER_12]: I'll put all the filing in.

524
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:15,693
[SPEAKER_12]: Please, if there are any comments, make sure they get forwarded to me directly.

525
00:32:16,623 --> 00:32:17,384
[SPEAKER_17]: Great, thank you.

[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Stroud.

537
00:32:31,418 --> 00:32:31,838

[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Sands.

539
00:32:32,739 --> 00:32:33,039

[SPEAKER_08]: President Leopold.

541
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:34,060
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

542
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:36,343
[SPEAKER_17]: Submitting the affirmative, zeroing the negative, motion passes.

543
00:32:38,585 --> 00:32:39,205
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Director Hunt.

544
00:32:41,034 --> 00:32:52,837
[SPEAKER_17]: 22-514 offered by President Morrell and referred from committee of the whole in ordinance amending chapter 14, article eight outdoor.

545
00:32:53,417 --> 00:33:00,079
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion of Councillor Knight to weigh the remainder of the reading, I have a brief synopsis from myself, seconded by Councillor Scarpelli.

546
00:33:00,919 --> 00:33:02,019
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

547
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:05,060
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

548
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:17,625
[SPEAKER_17]: I think he briefly stepped out.

549
00:33:17,665 --> 00:33:18,846
[SPEAKER_17]: He looks like he's running back.

550
00:33:18,886 --> 00:33:21,890
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

551
00:33:27,362 --> 00:33:31,485
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, Savannah Furners, your negative motion passes to weigh the reading and give a synopsis.

552
00:33:31,505 --> 00:33:55,200
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm pulling up the red line version, but in short, this is just a number of changes that were suggested by the council working in concert with PDS and our economic development director to streamline the process for having outdoor dining each year, things that include improved safety and appearance requirements as far as positioning on the sidewalk, having parklets on the sidewalk to make it a little bit,

553
00:33:55,940 --> 00:34:02,002
[SPEAKER_17]: safer and more appealing and able for pedestrians to move through more easily in the space.

554
00:34:02,022 --> 00:34:08,063
[SPEAKER_17]: Of course my great I have a motion from counselor night to approve for first reading.

555
00:34:08,264 --> 00:34:11,004
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there any other comments from the council or members of the public.

556
00:34:13,505 --> 00:34:27,791
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll just note that when we met in committee of the whole, there was basically the main change here between what we met on committee of the whole on and this is the inclusion of several items regarding insurance that Councilor Caravaglia requested and that the building commissioner and the planning department included in the ordinance.

557
00:34:28,252 --> 00:34:31,113
[SPEAKER_15]: So that is all addressed and I would second Councilor Knight's motion.

558
00:34:31,545 --> 00:34:31,865
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

559
00:34:31,885 --> 00:34:32,506
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Scarpallo.

560
00:34:32,526 --> 00:34:33,486
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Madam President.

561
00:34:33,606 --> 00:34:46,415
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know that one of the biggest concerns was making sure any of the outdoor dining areas are accessible for our handicapped and mothers with strollers.

562
00:34:46,695 --> 00:34:58,342
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that having the inspector in place and being the overseer is going to be the important piece to make sure that all of those areas are protected.

563
00:34:58,402 --> 00:34:59,203
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you.

564
00:34:59,663 --> 00:34:59,963
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

565
00:35:00,163 --> 00:35:01,584
[SPEAKER_17]: Any other comments from the Council?

566
00:35:02,724 --> 00:35:04,905
[SPEAKER_17]: Commissioner Fordy, did you want to add something?

567
00:35:04,925 --> 00:35:08,366
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, thank you, Madam President.

568
00:35:08,706 --> 00:35:27,093
[SPEAKER_03]: So, the only thing I would recommend for the Council, respectfully, is to perhaps run, if this does get passed tonight, to run this in concurrency or to not enforce the provisions of this ordinance in full force until

569
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:31,802
[SPEAKER_03]: such time as the executive order has expired.

570
00:35:32,383 --> 00:35:45,330
[SPEAKER_03]: Just recently, as you all may be aware, the state did extend the portion of the emergency order of the Chapter 53 Acts of 2020 to include outdoor dining.

571
00:35:45,611 --> 00:35:56,597
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the reasons why this has been extended, I know from an inside, is that the requirements under the plumbing code are still being worked out.

572
00:35:57,344 --> 00:36:03,407
[SPEAKER_03]: I think what they're trying to do is they're they're trying to exempt the plumbing code requirements from outdoor dining.

573
00:36:03,487 --> 00:36:12,831
[SPEAKER_03]: Currently, that requirement is in place and it would have to be enforced if this ordinance were to pass and be enforced in full.

574
00:36:13,611 --> 00:36:23,336
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm recommending that there be a delay in the executive order made by the state government supersede any local action.

575
00:36:24,578 --> 00:36:27,979
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I, I'm not exactly sure on that and I'm not clear.

576
00:36:28,179 --> 00:36:43,085
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I would, I would say that if, um, if there was a caveat and I would just, um, just, uh, read to you respectfully what I'm thinking about, um, here in draft, it would say, uh, this ordinance executive order chapter 53 acts of 2020 regarding extension of outdoor dining.

577
00:36:47,709 --> 00:36:50,731
[SPEAKER_03]: will become enforceable upon expulsion of said order.

578
00:36:51,271 --> 00:36:58,195
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing shall limit the authority of the building commissioner to enforce and regulate portions of this ordinance for reasons of public safety.

579
00:36:58,715 --> 00:37:02,397
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's my recommended language only that way there.

580
00:37:02,818 --> 00:37:11,582
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not required to enforce these provisions because, again, without, without the mention of it, I think it's a little bit ambiguous.

581
00:37:13,075 --> 00:37:30,065
[SPEAKER_03]: I honestly think that, you know, by having this in there, it just basically just cuts off a concurrency period, a person can comply with these provisions but again, my requirement to enforce these provisions will become effective upon the passing of this ordinance.

582
00:37:32,532 --> 00:37:41,375
[SPEAKER_04]: unless the executive order supersedes the local zoning ordinance, which in my- Well, it may, and that's why I said, that's why I mentioned in part.

583
00:37:41,595 --> 00:37:43,416
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, it's entirely up to you.

584
00:37:44,676 --> 00:37:52,659
[SPEAKER_03]: I have the language in draft I was gonna send to Mr. Herterbeest upon, you know, consideration.

585
00:37:52,719 --> 00:37:55,280
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, that's my only suggested language.

586
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,301
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Vice President Behrs.

587
00:37:59,274 --> 00:38:17,295
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Thank you, Madam President, Mr. Commissioner, under section 14 dash 490 regulatory authority you have the authority to promulgate rules and regulations necessary to implement and enforce the article, my recommendation would be that once this passes third reading and assigned and is on muni code which could be a couple months from now at the very least.

588
00:38:19,293 --> 00:38:22,495
[SPEAKER_15]: that you just take the language that you have and create a regulation to that effect.

589
00:38:22,555 --> 00:38:33,404
[SPEAKER_15]: And then, you know, it's your discretion to enforce if you pass regulation that says we'll be going by the, you know, the governor's executive order until that point, I don't think you'll have any objection from this council.

590
00:38:33,424 --> 00:38:35,525
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, fair enough.

591
00:38:38,287 --> 00:38:38,568
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

592
00:38:39,568 --> 00:38:39,909
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

593
00:38:40,069 --> 00:38:40,309
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

594
00:38:40,349 --> 00:38:41,790
[SPEAKER_17]: Any further discussion from the council?

595
00:38:43,311 --> 00:38:43,831
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Navarro.

596
00:38:45,575 --> 00:38:48,476
[SPEAKER_11]: William Navar, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B.

597
00:38:48,977 --> 00:38:54,700
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll be brief because I already outlined my concerns in more detail at a committee of the whole meeting.

598
00:38:56,360 --> 00:39:02,684
[SPEAKER_11]: But basically my suggestion is with regard to page 10, we got labeled number seven.

599
00:39:03,284 --> 00:39:08,287
[SPEAKER_11]: Outdoor dining furniture must be locked or stored inside during non-business hours.

600
00:39:09,507 --> 00:39:10,268
[SPEAKER_11]: I just think that,

601
00:39:11,308 --> 00:39:16,274
[SPEAKER_11]: Depending on how that's interpreted, it could be rather limiting and unnecessarily so.

602
00:39:16,294 --> 00:39:29,449
[SPEAKER_11]: I was actually just talking with, with somebody and maybe to make a concrete suggestion, it could be locked tied down or attached if the concern is that the is that the.

603
00:39:32,586 --> 00:39:35,129
[SPEAKER_11]: items could be stolen or become projectiles or something.

604
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:38,133
[SPEAKER_11]: And that would allow a little bit more flexibility.

605
00:39:38,854 --> 00:39:46,944
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Just for explanation purposes from a historical standpoint, we have an issue like this that came up when Wendy's was looking for an outside dining facility and.

606
00:39:47,805 --> 00:39:58,334
[SPEAKER_04]: what some of the concerns were was after hours when it's closed and no one's in the facility, people would be using the seats in the chairs to congregate late at night after 11 o'clock or 12 o'clock at night.

607
00:39:58,374 --> 00:40:07,782
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was more of a nuisance value thing as opposed to becoming projectiles or what's it called, fodder for larceny.

608
00:40:09,163 --> 00:40:09,483
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

609
00:40:11,024 --> 00:40:15,848
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I think that that's a concern and

610
00:40:17,961 --> 00:40:34,232
[SPEAKER_11]: I would hope that we could have 24 seven seating in the city without being afraid that it's going to cause a disturbance due to loitering and so on, especially on our major commercial streets and commercial squares.

611
00:40:35,373 --> 00:40:38,415
[SPEAKER_11]: But I appreciate being heard out on that concern.

612
00:40:38,455 --> 00:40:38,775
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

613
00:40:38,795 --> 00:40:39,696
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

614
00:40:40,977 --> 00:40:42,798
[SPEAKER_17]: Any other members of the public wish to speak?

615
00:40:44,307 --> 00:40:45,607
[SPEAKER_17]: for discussion from the council.

616
00:40:45,847 --> 00:40:51,768
[SPEAKER_17]: So we have a motion from Councilor Knight, seconded by Vice-President Behrs to approve for first reading.

617
00:40:53,449 --> 00:40:54,449
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

618
00:40:54,909 --> 00:40:55,629
[SPEAKER_08]: Vice-President Behrs.

619
00:40:55,649 --> 00:40:56,009
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

620
00:40:56,189 --> 00:40:56,849
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Kerrio.

621
00:40:56,929 --> 00:40:57,190
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

622
00:40:57,690 --> 00:40:58,270
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Collins.

623
00:40:58,930 --> 00:40:59,190
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

624
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:01,270
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Neill.

625
00:41:01,350 --> 00:41:01,590
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

626
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:02,871
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Stroud.

627
00:41:02,931 --> 00:41:03,151
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

628
00:41:03,651 --> 00:41:04,271
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Sands.

629
00:41:04,311 --> 00:41:04,511
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

630
00:41:04,811 --> 00:41:05,451
[SPEAKER_08]: President Rhoads.

631
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:05,891
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

632
00:41:06,051 --> 00:41:09,392
[SPEAKER_17]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, motion passes approved for first reading.

633
00:41:11,154 --> 00:41:21,564
[SPEAKER_17]: 22 dash 292 offered by President Morrell and Vice President bears be it so resolved the Medford City Council that we hold a committee of the whole meeting to discuss the council priorities and recommendations for the FY 24 city budget.

634
00:41:22,264 --> 00:41:28,230
[SPEAKER_17]: The further result that can counselors submit their interval individual ideas for budget recommendations to the city clerk by Friday, May 19.

635
00:41:29,815 --> 00:41:31,516
[SPEAKER_17]: I have nothing to add to this, Vice Chair Behr.

636
00:41:31,536 --> 00:41:32,676
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there anything else you'd like to add?

637
00:41:32,896 --> 00:41:49,784
[SPEAKER_15]: Nope, just that, you know, I think I'll add one thing, which is that I think we were hoping to maybe start these discussions earlier, but we are where we are at this point, given that, you know, doesn't look like we're gonna have any more information six weeks ago as we have today until essentially a budget is submitted to us.

638
00:41:49,864 --> 00:41:58,728
[SPEAKER_15]: So we have to go forward just kind of with whatever the information we have is today on making recommendations to the administration about what we'd like to see in the budget.

639
00:42:00,388 --> 00:42:00,948
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

640
00:42:00,988 --> 00:42:13,376
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, to the public, I know that I've talked to some people in the streets and some residents that want to point fingers at different members of this council for the reason why the budget process isn't moved forward.

641
00:42:14,957 --> 00:42:26,105
[SPEAKER_07]: I will let you know that Council President Morrell has worked diligently with the mayor's office to try to get a schedule for our upcoming budget meetings.

642
00:42:26,965 --> 00:42:28,627
[SPEAKER_07]: If anybody's familiar with what happened last year,

643
00:42:29,546 --> 00:42:31,050
[SPEAKER_07]: We actually didn't see a budget.

644
00:42:32,814 --> 00:42:36,042
[SPEAKER_07]: We both came in and may I had to come in at one in the morning.

645
00:42:36,848 --> 00:42:41,932
[SPEAKER_07]: to negotiate an agreement so we can get something passed.

646
00:42:43,213 --> 00:43:03,209
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know that what I find a little nerve wracking right now is that they're having open dialogue with the school department and the school committee about a very dire situation that's been publicly spread that the mayor is looking to cut

647
00:43:04,072 --> 00:43:09,294
[SPEAKER_07]: the education budget and look to let go of teachers.

648
00:43:10,195 --> 00:43:11,836
[SPEAKER_07]: So that to me is frightening.

649
00:43:12,356 --> 00:43:19,819
[SPEAKER_07]: And to the fact that no one from the city administration has even updated this council to let us know what is going on.

650
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:22,781
[SPEAKER_07]: This has been happening for over two to three weeks now.

651
00:43:23,961 --> 00:43:27,303
[SPEAKER_07]: This issue is happening two to three weeks, and no one

652
00:43:28,298 --> 00:43:43,746
[SPEAKER_07]: from the city administration has told us what's going on, either to calm everybody's nerves that there might be rumors or that what was sent out by the mayor's office to the school committee that we are having serious financial issues.

653
00:43:44,286 --> 00:43:56,593
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, we wouldn't know because we still haven't seen, here we are, middle of May, we still haven't seen financial paperwork of what's going on in a day-to-day role here in the city.

654
00:43:58,308 --> 00:44:04,894
[SPEAKER_07]: So I know that people, it's easy to say when you run to some people to say, oh no, this isn't the administration's fault.

655
00:44:04,914 --> 00:44:05,935
[SPEAKER_07]: This isn't the mayor's fault.

656
00:44:07,256 --> 00:44:08,477
[SPEAKER_07]: This is this group's fault.

657
00:44:08,557 --> 00:44:09,779
[SPEAKER_07]: This is this person's fault.

658
00:44:10,139 --> 00:44:10,960
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not true.

659
00:44:12,290 --> 00:44:28,867
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now we have a president council president that stands independently and works with the administration to try to get a schedule, so we can be informed so we can make the rational decisions needed for our constituents that have fallen on deaf ears, we've called for meeting.

660
00:44:29,728 --> 00:44:41,478
[SPEAKER_07]: over two months ago to talk about budget concerns directly with the school department that's dealing with something very serious, which was security issues that was brought forth that we needed to support our school district.

661
00:44:41,818 --> 00:44:42,379
[SPEAKER_07]: Correct.

662
00:44:42,939 --> 00:44:51,707
[SPEAKER_07]: And the Council President again worked diligently with the school committee, the word came back and said the mayor was looking for a date, and then it fell in the mayor's desk.

663
00:44:52,730 --> 00:45:06,142
[SPEAKER_07]: So again, I know the sounds let's beat up the mayor, what this sounds like is logical information so everybody understands where we are today financially in the city, this council doesn't know.

664
00:45:07,665 --> 00:45:09,987
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't know what's going on financially.

665
00:45:10,428 --> 00:45:25,001
[SPEAKER_07]: All we hear is that there's a letter floating around with the school committee, and they've had multiple meetings to discuss issues and concerns that we're in dire fiscal issues that are gonna lay teachers off, that are going to cut the school budget.

666
00:45:26,703 --> 00:45:32,528
[SPEAKER_07]: But again, here we are, May 9th, I believe, and we know nothing yet, zero.

667
00:45:33,834 --> 00:45:41,958
[SPEAKER_07]: No conversations from financial director, no conversations from the chief of staff, no conversation from the mayor's office, no conversations from the mayor.

668
00:45:43,139 --> 00:45:51,463
[SPEAKER_07]: And I wanna make this public because I'm getting tired of talking to members of this community that just wanna stick up for people that they believe in.

669
00:45:52,763 --> 00:45:53,824
[SPEAKER_07]: Understand something.

670
00:45:56,105 --> 00:46:00,447
[SPEAKER_07]: It's okay to look at an elected official and say they like them as people.

671
00:46:00,567 --> 00:46:01,928
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree, I like a lot of people.

672
00:46:02,958 --> 00:46:10,266
[SPEAKER_07]: But when you look at the positions that we're in, for instance, the mayor's position is the CEO of this community.

673
00:46:10,907 --> 00:46:14,611
[SPEAKER_07]: That means they're in charge, they're the boss, they're the buck stops with them.

674
00:46:14,631 --> 00:46:23,480
[SPEAKER_07]: And when we don't get information back, it's glaring that we don't have leadership that we need right now.

675
00:46:24,946 --> 00:46:28,669
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I'm frustrated, I've said it a thousand times, I'm frustrated.

676
00:46:28,689 --> 00:46:34,615
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm frustrated for the fact that no one is telling us what's going on, and we don't know what's going to happen.

677
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:42,142
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm going to guarantee you, we're going to sit here again on June 30th, and we're going to look at each other like dummies and say, what are we going to do now?

678
00:46:42,963 --> 00:46:46,606
[SPEAKER_07]: And someone's going to come to the podium at one in the morning and say, I found $12 million again.

679
00:46:48,533 --> 00:46:49,033
[SPEAKER_07]: I found it.

680
00:46:49,714 --> 00:46:50,874
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm going to give you what you need.

681
00:46:51,615 --> 00:46:52,435
[SPEAKER_07]: And we vote on it.

682
00:46:52,495 --> 00:46:53,036
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, right.

683
00:46:53,096 --> 00:46:58,739
[SPEAKER_07]: We wake up the next morning and what happens here we are 10 months later, we still don't have an attorney for the city.

684
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:02,341
[SPEAKER_07]: We still don't see a facilities person that's actually working for the city.

685
00:47:02,822 --> 00:47:04,663
[SPEAKER_07]: We still don't have the things that we asked for.

686
00:47:06,505 --> 00:47:14,947
[SPEAKER_07]: the financial documentation from the financial director that was given to us from the previous financial director with the same exact software.

687
00:47:15,468 --> 00:47:19,869
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't, we can't get it from this council, this leadership.

688
00:47:20,289 --> 00:47:32,572
[SPEAKER_07]: So again, Madam President, I apologize for going on, but I'm tired of people on the street blaming fellow city councilors and their party affiliation on why things aren't happening in the city.

689
00:47:33,032 --> 00:47:34,193
[SPEAKER_07]: Things aren't happening in the city

690
00:47:35,304 --> 00:47:40,248
[SPEAKER_07]: because of one person and one body, and that's the mayor's office.

691
00:47:41,229 --> 00:47:46,473
[SPEAKER_07]: And believe me, it has nothing to do about liking the person personally, because I think she's a fabulous person.

692
00:47:47,614 --> 00:47:48,815
[SPEAKER_07]: I've known her a long time.

693
00:47:50,717 --> 00:47:55,341
[SPEAKER_07]: But as a leader of the city, I don't know why we're blinded and what's going on.

694
00:47:55,361 --> 00:47:56,902
[SPEAKER_07]: The frustration is real.

695
00:47:58,764 --> 00:48:03,188
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a city councilor and I haven't talked to the mayor's office or the chief of staff in over a year.

696
00:48:05,693 --> 00:48:06,634
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Madam President.

697
00:48:07,135 --> 00:48:09,737
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Carvio.

698
00:48:10,278 --> 00:48:12,501
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Madam President.

699
00:48:12,741 --> 00:48:17,826
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the big concerns I have is the $25 million in free cash.

700
00:48:19,008 --> 00:48:20,389
[SPEAKER_02]: Where did that come from?

701
00:48:23,329 --> 00:48:24,510
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we made a motion.

702
00:48:24,530 --> 00:48:28,693
[SPEAKER_02]: We made a motion a couple of weeks ago and we haven't heard anything.

703
00:48:29,434 --> 00:48:33,497
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a big concern over where that's come from.

704
00:48:33,697 --> 00:48:39,242
[SPEAKER_02]: We've never had that kind of money in free cash ever in my 12 years in this council.

705
00:48:39,862 --> 00:48:49,090
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm still waiting for the answer on that, to figure out where that's going and how we can spend it, or if it's even a legitimate number.

706
00:48:51,286 --> 00:48:53,848
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor night, Madam President, thank you very much.

707
00:48:54,108 --> 00:48:56,090
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's amazing here we are again.

708
00:48:57,130 --> 00:48:57,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Now it was a baby.

709
00:48:57,811 --> 00:49:01,814
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, 16 months ago, we passed this council in January, January 22.

710
00:49:01,914 --> 00:49:12,942
[SPEAKER_04]: We passed a resolution asking that the mayor provide us very simple financial data, like Councilor Scott belly said the previous administrations, previous financial directors, but the same exact software were able to give us.

711
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:18,641
[SPEAKER_04]: All we want to know is where you're spending the money on a weekly basis.

712
00:49:19,142 --> 00:49:19,502
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all.

713
00:49:20,182 --> 00:49:21,603
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we said, not even weekly, monthly.

714
00:49:21,843 --> 00:49:23,684
[SPEAKER_04]: Show us where you're spending the money on a monthly basis.

715
00:49:23,764 --> 00:49:26,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Show us what account your money's coming out of and where it's going.

716
00:49:27,205 --> 00:49:32,188
[SPEAKER_04]: The response we get from the chief of staff is, we don't have someone that has the time to redact that information.

717
00:49:33,108 --> 00:49:34,149
[SPEAKER_04]: What needs to be redacted?

718
00:49:34,749 --> 00:49:36,790
[SPEAKER_04]: The Transparency Administration, Madam President.

719
00:49:36,810 --> 00:49:37,250
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember that?

720
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:40,352
[SPEAKER_04]: Community, unity, and transparency.

721
00:49:41,472 --> 00:49:42,293
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't see any unity.

722
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:52,315
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't see any unity among the working people that work in this building, among the rank and file members of our DPW and fire department who have gone without a contract.

723
00:49:53,676 --> 00:49:58,219
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't see any unity with the teachers who took a vote of no confidence in this administration and the school committee.

724
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:04,863
[SPEAKER_04]: I certainly don't see any transparency when, for 16 months, we've been asking for simple financial data.

725
00:50:05,764 --> 00:50:06,424
[SPEAKER_04]: Follow the money.

726
00:50:06,444 --> 00:50:07,245
[SPEAKER_04]: Where's the money going?

727
00:50:07,365 --> 00:50:08,225
[SPEAKER_04]: And they won't let us look.

728
00:50:08,525 --> 00:50:10,146
[SPEAKER_04]: They won't let us follow the money, Madam President.

729
00:50:10,466 --> 00:50:11,127
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's shameful.

730
00:50:11,607 --> 00:50:12,788
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's absolutely shameful.

731
00:50:13,957 --> 00:50:15,057
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a smoke and mirrors game.

732
00:50:16,178 --> 00:50:27,741
[SPEAKER_04]: So when I think back, and we're talking about the budget now, and I think back to that night, the last day of June, last year, and the mayor came up here and she all of a sudden, money was falling out of the sky all of a sudden.

733
00:50:28,041 --> 00:50:29,621
[SPEAKER_04]: What was this council?

734
00:50:29,661 --> 00:50:34,163
[SPEAKER_04]: It was $8 million deficit and then they found 4 million in the mayor's top drawer, right?

735
00:50:34,203 --> 00:50:39,044
[SPEAKER_04]: Then they came in here and the council had some priorities that we needed funded, like an attorney.

736
00:50:40,285 --> 00:50:43,408
[SPEAKER_04]: like an assistant city solicitor for the council and the mayor stood up there.

737
00:50:43,428 --> 00:50:47,332
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what the mayor said, I will hire an assistant city solicitor for the council.

738
00:50:47,372 --> 00:50:48,753
[SPEAKER_04]: I will post the job in September.

739
00:50:49,374 --> 00:50:50,014
[SPEAKER_04]: That was in June.

740
00:50:50,535 --> 00:50:51,296
[SPEAKER_04]: We still don't have one.

741
00:50:51,336 --> 00:50:52,377
[SPEAKER_04]: The job hasn't been posted.

742
00:50:53,538 --> 00:50:56,441
[SPEAKER_04]: It's posted in February.

743
00:50:56,581 --> 00:50:57,522
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

744
00:50:57,902 --> 00:51:00,705
[SPEAKER_04]: And where did the mayor want to take the money to fund these positions?

745
00:51:01,105 --> 00:51:01,766
[SPEAKER_04]: Can anybody remember?

746
00:51:02,366 --> 00:51:04,729
[SPEAKER_04]: She wanted to take them out of the negotiated salaries account.

747
00:51:06,893 --> 00:51:15,716
[SPEAKER_04]: The negotiated salaries account, the account where the administration puts money aside to provide cost of living adjustments for those same rank and file workers that she's beating on every day.

748
00:51:19,878 --> 00:51:22,479
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a chief of staff that doesn't act like a liaison or a partner.

749
00:51:23,139 --> 00:51:25,020
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a chief of staff that acts like a defense attorney.

750
00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:30,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Refuse to answer questions, refuse to provide us with information, refuse to provide us with data.

751
00:51:32,094 --> 00:51:40,656
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, when someone stands up before me, and we talk and we cut a deal, and they make a promise to me, and they don't fulfill that promise, I call them a liar.

752
00:51:42,576 --> 00:51:43,296
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I call them.

753
00:51:43,756 --> 00:51:51,198
[SPEAKER_04]: And after all this time that's gone by, with no assistant city solicitor, with no phase two of the zoning review, I think it's safe to say the mayor's a liar.

754
00:51:52,178 --> 00:52:00,540
[SPEAKER_04]: The mayor lied to this body to get what she needed, which was a budget, so that she wouldn't have to talk to us for another year.

755
00:52:02,058 --> 00:52:03,718
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that's the fact of the matter, right?

756
00:52:03,778 --> 00:52:04,619
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the writing on the wall.

757
00:52:04,639 --> 00:52:05,419
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the rationale.

758
00:52:05,459 --> 00:52:07,579
[SPEAKER_04]: If we were watching this TV show at home, that's what we'd see.

759
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:10,400
[SPEAKER_04]: The mayor came in here, she promised everybody everything.

760
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:12,581
[SPEAKER_04]: Sprinkles were flying from the sky.

761
00:52:13,121 --> 00:52:13,861
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything was great.

762
00:52:15,521 --> 00:52:17,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Two days later, she's down the Cape.

763
00:52:18,762 --> 00:52:19,703
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody hears from anybody.

764
00:52:20,323 --> 00:52:28,865
[SPEAKER_04]: And now here we are, scheduling a meeting for May 19th to talk about the next budget, when we still haven't even gotten the things we were promised from the last one.

765
00:52:30,232 --> 00:52:32,213
[SPEAKER_04]: Typical of this administration, Madam President.

766
00:52:32,794 --> 00:52:34,094
[SPEAKER_04]: Typical of this administration.

767
00:52:34,935 --> 00:52:35,936
[SPEAKER_04]: I want a mayor that leads.

768
00:52:36,876 --> 00:52:38,697
[SPEAKER_04]: I want a mayor that administrates government.

769
00:52:39,117 --> 00:52:42,139
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want a social media influencer for a mayor in my city.

770
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:44,101
[SPEAKER_04]: And I feel like that's what we have.

771
00:52:45,021 --> 00:52:46,422
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always lead with a press release.

772
00:52:47,162 --> 00:52:49,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Go skating with the kids, go play rock, paper, scissors.

773
00:52:49,964 --> 00:52:51,605
[SPEAKER_04]: But you can't drive down one street in the city.

774
00:52:51,625 --> 00:52:59,050
[SPEAKER_04]: If you live on a private way and you call somebody to trim a tree and get a pothole fixed, good God, it's like you're asking for a miracle.

775
00:53:01,188 --> 00:53:02,409
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like you're asking for a miracle.

776
00:53:04,610 --> 00:53:10,534
[SPEAKER_04]: We've asked the DPW director about this private way issue and how we can have equity and parity among residents in this community.

777
00:53:11,334 --> 00:53:12,975
[SPEAKER_04]: The administration closes their ears.

778
00:53:13,175 --> 00:53:13,916
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't want to hear it.

779
00:53:15,176 --> 00:53:26,343
[SPEAKER_04]: When we say we want to take some of these public private ways off the rules and put them as public ways, because that might help us get more chapter 90 funds because the city administration only appropriates $900,000 a year

780
00:53:28,812 --> 00:53:32,754
[SPEAKER_04]: for road repairs, and that's money that's appropriated through our cherry sheet in Northridge City Coffers.

781
00:53:33,114 --> 00:53:38,056
[SPEAKER_04]: The mayor does not match one penny, not one penny in road repairs in this community.

782
00:53:38,677 --> 00:53:46,120
[SPEAKER_04]: So when we talk about priorities, I mean, the meeting's gonna be 24 hours long.

783
00:53:47,561 --> 00:53:51,303
[SPEAKER_04]: But the number one priority that I have for this council in moving forward in the budget

784
00:53:52,443 --> 00:53:57,224
[SPEAKER_04]: going forward is we hold the mayor accountable to her promises, to what she said she was going to give us.

785
00:53:57,864 --> 00:54:01,445
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if she's going to lie to us, then she's going to lie to the people we represent, too.

786
00:54:03,585 --> 00:54:19,268
[SPEAKER_04]: And we can no longer be a steward for the taxpayer in this community, because we're getting treated like mushrooms, getting thrown in the closet, in the dock, in the dirt, fed fertilizer in the way of press releases, Instagram posts, and Facebook posts.

787
00:54:21,938 --> 00:54:26,202
[SPEAKER_04]: and expected to move forward and make informed decisions on behalf of the people that put us here.

788
00:54:26,582 --> 00:54:29,124
[SPEAKER_04]: And then look in the mirror the next morning and say we're doing a good job.

789
00:54:30,045 --> 00:54:31,666
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not doing a good job, Madam President.

790
00:54:32,407 --> 00:54:33,588
[SPEAKER_04]: We're doing a terrible job.

791
00:54:34,529 --> 00:54:36,911
[SPEAKER_04]: We're doing a terrible job in this community delivering services.

792
00:54:37,291 --> 00:54:38,612
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never seen the city look worse.

793
00:54:39,626 --> 00:54:41,168
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never seen the city look worse.

794
00:54:41,728 --> 00:54:55,923
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a miracle today when I drove around the Winthrop Street Rotary, the Rotary which by the way, according to the contract on the Eversource project is supposed to be reconstructed, which hasn't been reconstructed and I mind you probably won't be reconstructed because it's too close to an election.

795
00:54:57,153 --> 00:54:58,535
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to show some results somewhere.

796
00:54:59,477 --> 00:55:02,503
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been holding all the results in the result bag, waiting for someone to run against us.

797
00:55:02,543 --> 00:55:04,947
[SPEAKER_04]: And now we're going to pour them all out and show you all the good stuff we're doing.

798
00:55:05,328 --> 00:55:08,914
[SPEAKER_04]: If we didn't have an opponent, if Consulate Gavreel didn't have the courage to run against his mayor.

799
00:55:11,108 --> 00:55:12,229
[SPEAKER_04]: Council, budget priorities.

800
00:55:12,469 --> 00:55:14,971
[SPEAKER_04]: My budget priority is an administrator that administers.

801
00:55:15,692 --> 00:55:18,575
[SPEAKER_04]: A public administrator, not a social media influencer.

802
00:55:19,415 --> 00:55:20,576
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone that keeps their promises.

803
00:55:21,177 --> 00:55:21,577
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all.

804
00:55:22,118 --> 00:55:22,858
[SPEAKER_04]: Not asking for much.

805
00:55:23,179 --> 00:55:26,502
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone that comes to work, rolls their sleeves up, and does what they say they're gonna do, Madam President.

806
00:55:26,842 --> 00:55:27,663
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that too much to ask for?

807
00:55:29,573 --> 00:55:30,214
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.

808
00:55:30,234 --> 00:55:30,855
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

809
00:55:31,235 --> 00:55:32,597
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor saying, Thank you.

810
00:55:32,617 --> 00:55:49,316
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, I just wanted to say I think last year was my first year doing the budget on the council and I think, um, Councilor Colin and I Collins and I but also the rest of the city council did learn a lot in the process about what the best way to handle the budget is what questions to ask.

811
00:55:50,938 --> 00:56:10,759
[SPEAKER_14]: What criticisms to love me, and I wanted to bring it back to this paper in particular, and focus on the text of it I think one of my biggest lessons from last time was that that committee the whole meeting we had on budget priorities was very very helpful in helping us get on the same page about what to negotiate for in the budget and.

812
00:56:12,020 --> 00:56:19,146
[SPEAKER_14]: So I wanted to say that I'm very enthusiastic about this resolution in particular because I, I think that it was one of the most useful things we did last time.

813
00:56:20,207 --> 00:56:22,969
[SPEAKER_14]: And I do, I encourage people watching and people at home.

814
00:56:23,229 --> 00:56:35,259
[SPEAKER_14]: I know there's been a lot of posts on Facebook and social media about what people want to see from the budget, I encourage people to reach out to us before, before May 19, with what they want to see in the city budget.

815
00:56:37,541 --> 00:56:55,077
[SPEAKER_14]: There's, there's a lot of mistrust with, you know, people, people not being heard not feeling like they're being heard, and I wanted to make sure that city councils, one place where they, what they want to see in the budget is is heard, and that we're negotiating for them as well.

816
00:56:56,077 --> 00:56:58,700
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I wanted to support this paper and I'll second it as well.

817
00:56:59,438 --> 00:57:06,242
[SPEAKER_17]: I do just want to note that I was speaking with the mayor today and the hope is still to get us a budget by the end of the month.

818
00:57:06,262 --> 00:57:08,003
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's see if that happens.

819
00:57:09,664 --> 00:57:11,345
[SPEAKER_17]: Any further discussion on this.

820
00:57:11,905 --> 00:57:15,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Madam President, did you say which month was it this month or just a month, month of May, month of May.

821
00:57:15,827 --> 00:57:16,307
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

822
00:57:17,968 --> 00:57:20,970
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Madam President, Councilor going to be a full budget.

823
00:57:21,778 --> 00:57:22,819
[SPEAKER_17]: I did.

824
00:57:22,859 --> 00:57:26,983
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, I did say we need a piece of paper.

825
00:57:28,103 --> 00:57:31,326
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to see a budget that I can take home and study it for a week.

826
00:57:32,127 --> 00:57:37,932
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to be given the school budget on a Friday on a Friday night at 10 o'clock, and then have to vote on it on Tuesday.

827
00:57:37,992 --> 00:57:38,712
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I did.

828
00:57:39,013 --> 00:57:41,775
[SPEAKER_17]: I did make it clear we would not be meeting on anything piecemeal.

829
00:57:42,235 --> 00:57:42,536
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

830
00:57:42,756 --> 00:57:43,076
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

831
00:57:43,156 --> 00:57:45,958
[SPEAKER_17]: We have a motion on this paper.

832
00:57:52,356 --> 00:57:57,377
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion of Councilor Collins dropped off.

833
00:57:57,417 --> 00:58:07,319
[SPEAKER_17]: So on the motion of Councilor Knight seconded by to approve seconded by Vice Mayor all those in favor.

834
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:09,240
[SPEAKER_17]: All those opposed motion passes.

835
00:58:12,481 --> 00:58:14,864
[SPEAKER_17]: 23-293 offered by Councillor Knight.

836
00:58:15,184 --> 00:58:20,291
[SPEAKER_17]: Whereas the motorcycle is a popular means of transportation for commuting as well as for touring and recreation.

837
00:58:20,411 --> 00:58:26,298
[SPEAKER_17]: And whereas there is a growing need for cooperation among the drivers of automobiles and trucks, motorcyclists, bicyclists.

838
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:45,020
[SPEAKER_17]: and pedestrians who use our streets and highways to reduce accidents, injuries and fatalities and whereas it is critical for all Massachusetts citizens to increase their knowledge of the rules of the road, and the rights and responsibilities of all roadway users, and whereas over 900 motor vehicles are owned and operated by our fellow citizen

839
00:58:45,460 --> 00:59:00,248
[SPEAKER_17]: bikers homeowners and residents of Medford and 10s of 1000 more visiting and touring our city from neighboring communities and whereas numerous departments and organizations are committed to making our streets and highways safe for all motor vehicle related transportation urging and reminding drivers to check twice save a life motorcycles are everywhere.

840
00:59:00,728 --> 00:59:04,570
[SPEAKER_17]: Check twice when pulling out and backing out from park positions check twice and making left turns.

841
00:59:05,010 --> 00:59:10,193
[SPEAKER_17]: Check twice when changing traffic lanes check twice for our fellow citizens bikers from Medford and visitors to our city.

842
00:59:11,153 --> 00:59:27,605
[SPEAKER_17]: on motorcycles now therefore the city of council of the city of Medford, Massachusetts hereby join with the governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and all agencies and organizations proclaim this to be our motorcycle safety awareness period here in the city of Medford, and wish all who ride and enjoyable and safe writing season counselor night.

843
00:59:28,129 --> 00:59:31,514
[SPEAKER_04]: Madam President, thank you very much, and I would defer to Councilor Cabello on this.

844
00:59:31,554 --> 00:59:42,008
[SPEAKER_04]: He was a co-sponsor of this resolution, as he has been in the past, but I erroneously excluded him when I sent it to the City Clerk after speaking with friends from the Massachusetts Motorcycle Association.

845
00:59:43,129 --> 00:59:43,650
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Madam President.

846
00:59:46,610 --> 00:59:48,811
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President, former Mr. President.

847
00:59:50,252 --> 00:59:55,754
[SPEAKER_04]: As this resolution says, Madam President, there are hundreds, several hundred motorcycles registered in the city of Medford.

848
00:59:56,394 --> 01:00:02,437
[SPEAKER_04]: Thousands upon thousands of motorcycles pass through our community daily with Route 93 cutting right through the middle of our city.

849
01:00:03,197 --> 01:00:06,879
[SPEAKER_04]: And quite frankly, the condition of our roadways aren't great.

850
01:00:07,879 --> 01:00:11,461
[SPEAKER_04]: So these are things that do lead to situations of accident.

851
01:00:14,460 --> 01:00:17,521
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a resolution that I've been supporting now for a number of years.

852
01:00:17,802 --> 01:00:18,662
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fitting.

853
01:00:19,242 --> 01:00:25,605
[SPEAKER_04]: I first got involved with the Massachusetts Motorcycle Association when I was working for Senator Shannon, the first resolution we spoke of this evening.

854
01:00:26,065 --> 01:00:36,290
[SPEAKER_04]: And through his office, I became very friendly with some of the individuals there that were working for a better Massachusetts when it came to rights and when it came to protections for motorcyclists.

855
01:00:36,750 --> 01:00:40,872
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the things that came out of this was motorcycle awareness period, Madam President, before us this evening.

856
01:00:41,532 --> 01:00:44,535
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a paper that has been supported by the Governor and Lieutenant Governor.

857
01:00:45,036 --> 01:00:48,339
[SPEAKER_04]: They've established the Massachusetts Motorcycle Awareness Period.

858
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:56,788
[SPEAKER_04]: And as the weather changes and we see more and more people taking their motorcycles out, it's just important for us to be aware and cognizant of the fact that these

859
01:00:58,659 --> 01:00:59,980
[SPEAKER_04]: motor vehicles are going to be on the roadway.

860
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,922
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not used to seeing them so much in the bad weather, but the good weather's here before us now.

861
01:01:03,782 --> 01:01:07,605
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a safety issue, Madam President, but it's also a sharing the road issue.

862
01:01:07,925 --> 01:01:18,612
[SPEAKER_04]: So many of us are concerned about putting bike lanes in and bus lanes in, but we forget a little bit about those of us that drive motorized vehicles and those on the motorcycle are the most vulnerable when they're on the roadway.

863
01:01:19,112 --> 01:01:27,778
[SPEAKER_04]: So with that being said, Madam President, I would like to ask my council colleagues to support the resolution and thank you all for indulging me with such a long piece of legislation.

864
01:01:30,192 --> 01:01:30,953
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Madam President.

865
01:01:31,213 --> 01:01:32,935
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councillor Knight, for bringing this forward again.

866
01:01:37,059 --> 01:01:42,104
[SPEAKER_02]: Motorists on vehicles and cars, I'm on the road all day.

867
01:01:42,565 --> 01:01:45,868
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll notice they're a lot more aggressive now than they've ever been.

868
01:01:47,049 --> 01:01:49,151
[SPEAKER_02]: No one will let you in or anywhere.

869
01:01:51,437 --> 01:01:56,679
[SPEAKER_02]: it's hard enough driving a car on roads, never mind driving a motorcycle or a bicycle.

870
01:01:57,039 --> 01:02:16,784
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think people, especially, you know, we have many, many drivers now here because of our ride share services, our delivery services, all these companies that have sprouted up since the pandemic, and now driving around the city in troves,

871
01:02:19,571 --> 01:02:24,492
[SPEAKER_02]: hundreds of thousands of more cars are now on the road than were ever here 10 years ago.

872
01:02:24,952 --> 01:02:28,793
[SPEAKER_02]: So the motorcycles are in more danger now than they've ever been.

873
01:02:29,333 --> 01:02:36,234
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a good law and people should check twice to make sure they see the motorcycle or bicycle.

874
01:02:36,254 --> 01:02:38,895
[SPEAKER_02]: So I support this program wholeheartedly.

875
01:02:39,735 --> 01:02:40,655
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Carvalho.

876
01:02:41,375 --> 01:02:42,655
[SPEAKER_17]: Any further discussion from the council?

877
01:02:42,675 --> 01:02:45,416
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm gonna go to Mr. Clerk.

878
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:47,500
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Madam President.

879
01:02:48,460 --> 01:02:51,381
[SPEAKER_09]: As you all know, I firmly believe the city clerk should be seen but not heard.

880
01:02:51,461 --> 01:02:55,202
[SPEAKER_09]: But this is the one resolution that I try to speak on every year.

881
01:02:55,302 --> 01:02:57,282
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to thank Councilor Knight again for putting this on.

882
01:02:58,623 --> 01:03:04,424
[SPEAKER_09]: Almost 43 years ago, my father was killed in a motorcycle accident not far from this chamber.

883
01:03:05,384 --> 01:03:07,525
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's something I'm still

884
01:03:08,585 --> 01:03:09,346
[SPEAKER_09]: dealing with every day.

885
01:03:09,366 --> 01:03:15,410
[SPEAKER_09]: And motorcycle safety should be a top priority for everybody who uses our roadways.

886
01:03:16,031 --> 01:03:19,954
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just again wanted to thank you very much for putting this resolution on Council night.

887
01:03:21,875 --> 01:03:22,656
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. Clark.

888
01:03:23,236 --> 01:03:34,845
[SPEAKER_17]: And if I could as well, I also speak my cousin nearly lost her life on 93 clipped by a driver who wasn't paying attention and now will live the rest of her life with a traumatic brain injury that says severely.

889
01:03:35,380 --> 01:03:36,221
[SPEAKER_17]: impacted her life.

890
01:03:36,301 --> 01:03:42,009
[SPEAKER_17]: So I thank Councilor Knight for bringing this forward and raising this issue and noting this period of awareness.

891
01:03:43,651 --> 01:03:48,398
[SPEAKER_17]: So on the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Sang, all those in favor?

892
01:03:49,319 --> 01:03:50,200
[SPEAKER_17]: All those opposed?

893
01:03:50,321 --> 01:03:50,961
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes.

894
01:03:52,585 --> 01:03:54,826
[SPEAKER_17]: to 3-294 offered by Councilor Sang.

895
01:03:55,326 --> 01:04:03,988
[SPEAKER_17]: Be it so resolved that the City Council ask the City Administration and the Massachusetts Department of Transportation about plans for Middlesex Ave and if there are plans to keep the new crosswalks.

896
01:04:04,048 --> 01:04:04,588
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Sang.

897
01:04:04,868 --> 01:04:06,648
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, President Morrell.

898
01:04:06,768 --> 01:04:19,091
[SPEAKER_14]: So for context, if you've driven down Middlesex, there are a bunch of sidewalk repairs going on and they've created a bunch of temporary crosswalks across Middlesex and

899
01:04:20,191 --> 01:04:24,075
[SPEAKER_14]: That project wasn't very much communicated to us on the council or the public.

900
01:04:24,435 --> 01:04:39,308
[SPEAKER_14]: And so, naturally questions come up on the DPW to get back to me on what the plans were exactly and they didn't send me a file so if anyone's interested, I can forward that essentially we're getting.

901
01:04:40,980 --> 01:04:42,881
[SPEAKER_14]: We're keeping the same crosswalks.

902
01:04:42,901 --> 01:04:45,743
[SPEAKER_14]: We're just getting improvements on the infrastructure on the curbs.

903
01:04:47,284 --> 01:04:57,090
[SPEAKER_14]: We are getting at Middlesex and Riverside, I think we're getting lights, which is a good improvement for that area because it's always hard to cross.

904
01:04:57,110 --> 01:04:57,970
[SPEAKER_14]: Lights for the crosswalk?

905
01:04:57,990 --> 01:04:58,911
[SPEAKER_14]: For the crosswalk, yes.

906
01:05:00,764 --> 01:05:02,905
[SPEAKER_14]: which it's hard to cross.

907
01:05:03,105 --> 01:05:06,227
[SPEAKER_14]: Growing up there, cars are whizzing by super fast.

908
01:05:06,828 --> 01:05:11,390
[SPEAKER_14]: And without lights, you don't know when you can cross and when it's smart to cross.

909
01:05:11,470 --> 01:05:12,991
[SPEAKER_14]: And so that will be an improvement.

910
01:05:14,212 --> 01:05:20,435
[SPEAKER_14]: The temporary crosswalks that are drawn between Riverside and 9th will not stay, though.

911
01:05:21,116 --> 01:05:22,396
[SPEAKER_14]: But that's the update.

912
01:05:22,497 --> 01:05:23,237
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for that update.

913
01:05:24,028 --> 01:05:25,088
[SPEAKER_17]: further discussion from the council.

914
01:05:25,288 --> 01:05:26,889
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to present for me.

915
01:05:27,229 --> 01:05:32,371
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the council for bringing this up and as we talk about Middlesex have something comes to mind, you know, as the weather's changing.

916
01:05:32,791 --> 01:05:37,292
[SPEAKER_04]: And as we see the nicer weather get out we see a lot of people like to do what go get their car washed right.

917
01:05:37,772 --> 01:05:40,873
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've had a lot of problems with the car wash down there in Middlesex Avenue.

918
01:05:41,513 --> 01:05:46,175
[SPEAKER_04]: So, on top of Councilor Singh's resolution I'd just like to amend it to ask that the city administration.

919
01:05:47,375 --> 01:05:53,381
[SPEAKER_04]: ensure that the police department performs directed patrols down in the area to ensure safe passage of vehicular traffic.

920
01:05:54,702 --> 01:06:02,490
[SPEAKER_04]: In case that there is an emergency down there, we don't want to impact emergency response times with the traffic coming out of BJ's and the car wash.

921
01:06:02,590 --> 01:06:04,051
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a nightmare down there.

922
01:06:04,251 --> 01:06:07,074
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a pretty popular place, Madam President.

923
01:06:07,094 --> 01:06:08,195
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's one of those things where

924
01:06:10,177 --> 01:06:12,518
[SPEAKER_04]: we're a victim of a local business's success.

925
01:06:13,238 --> 01:06:17,860
[SPEAKER_04]: So we need to take appropriate steps to make sure that the neighborhood and the residents and the quality of life are protected in that area.

926
01:06:18,740 --> 01:06:19,401
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

927
01:06:19,421 --> 01:06:20,161
[SPEAKER_17]: Any further discussion?

928
01:06:20,181 --> 01:06:21,041
[SPEAKER_17]: Vice-President Behrs?

929
01:06:21,061 --> 01:06:26,543
[SPEAKER_15]: I think you can also apply the great axiom about, well, you can't fly a spacecraft to the sun.

930
01:06:26,583 --> 01:06:27,484
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, we'll just go at night.

931
01:06:27,644 --> 01:06:28,644
[SPEAKER_15]: Just go at night, Councilor.

932
01:06:34,066 --> 01:06:38,448
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion of Councilor Sang, as amended by Councilor Knight, seconded by

933
01:06:41,417 --> 01:06:42,898
[SPEAKER_17]: by Susan bears all those in favor.

934
01:06:43,678 --> 01:06:45,559
[SPEAKER_17]: All those opposed motion passes.

935
01:06:46,159 --> 01:06:51,222
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll just spend the rules for take public participation to put people sitting here a while.

936
01:06:52,142 --> 01:06:57,665
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion of Councilor Carvialho to suspend the rules to take public participation seconded by Councilor Knight all those in favor.

937
01:06:58,265 --> 01:07:01,247
[SPEAKER_17]: All those opposed motion passes going to public participation.

938
01:07:03,085 --> 01:07:07,127
[SPEAKER_17]: Dear Claire Kurtabys, I'm requesting to be put on the Tuesday, May 9th, 2023 council agenda.

939
01:07:07,147 --> 01:07:11,289
[SPEAKER_17]: I would like to speak about the sudden change on what services are provided to private ways in the city of Medford.

940
01:07:11,690 --> 01:07:17,893
[SPEAKER_17]: If the homeowners of the home on private ways are not given the same services as public ways, then there should be a different tax rate for private ways.

941
01:07:18,353 --> 01:07:20,514
[SPEAKER_17]: Lisa D. Fabritas, 32 Winford Way.

942
01:07:20,534 --> 01:07:25,717
[SPEAKER_17]: Lisa, wanna come up and speak?

943
01:07:26,758 --> 01:07:27,098
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

944
01:07:30,758 --> 01:07:31,059
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sorry.

945
01:07:31,119 --> 01:07:32,319
[SPEAKER_17]: I was waiting for your mic to turn on.

946
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:33,400
[SPEAKER_17]: It's on now, though, so you're good.

947
01:07:33,580 --> 01:07:33,921
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

948
01:07:35,182 --> 01:07:41,786
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm here on behalf of many, if not all residents living on Winford Way or on any private way in the city of Medford.

949
01:07:42,567 --> 01:07:53,235
[SPEAKER_16]: For 19 years, I've been residing on Winford Way, during which time the city has maintained the streets and sidewalks, planting and removing trees, sidewalk repairs, snow plowing, and even street cleaning.

950
01:07:53,946 --> 01:08:02,788
[SPEAKER_16]: However, I was told last week by Owen, the city engineer, that the city will no longer use public funds to maintain private ways.

951
01:08:03,548 --> 01:08:11,850
[SPEAKER_16]: He told me the days of knowing someone or having family members who work in the city to take care of private ways are over.

952
01:08:12,911 --> 01:08:18,712
[SPEAKER_16]: I told him that I don't know anyone and neither do I have or had any family members working in the city hall.

953
01:08:19,687 --> 01:08:41,382
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd explained to Owen that I have emails dating back to 2021 from Aggie, the tree warden, and the mayor's office, confirming that the city would cut a root from a tree that was planted by the city 19 years ago, that has been pulling up the sidewalk and breaking a wall on my property for the past three years.

954
01:08:42,572 --> 01:08:53,817
[SPEAKER_16]: Owen told me that they, the city and Aggie, had made a mistake and that the city will be following the rules for private ways going forward.

955
01:08:54,797 --> 01:09:05,702
[SPEAKER_16]: He also told me he doesn't know who owns Winford Way, which is a private way, noting it could be every resident on the street or could be a few people.

956
01:09:06,508 --> 01:09:11,390
[SPEAKER_16]: He suggested that I spend $500 to hire a real estate lawyer to find out.

957
01:09:12,210 --> 01:09:18,333
[SPEAKER_16]: I told him that it's the city's responsibility to know this information and to have it on record.

958
01:09:19,353 --> 01:09:24,695
[SPEAKER_16]: I then followed up with the current mayor who supported and concurred with Owen's comments.

959
01:09:26,176 --> 01:09:35,900
[SPEAKER_16]: In summary, and before I start a petition from residents living on private ways to pursue legal avenues to resolve this, I would like to ask the council

960
01:09:37,058 --> 01:09:53,924
[SPEAKER_16]: to approve a city ordinance confirming that all roads, streets, and private ways that are accessible to the public be equally maintained by the city since we are all paying the same taxes for these services.

961
01:09:55,065 --> 01:10:00,787
[SPEAKER_16]: This will also avoid administrations from changing policies and practices in the future.

962
01:10:02,282 --> 01:10:17,473
[SPEAKER_16]: If for any reason the city is unwilling to pass such an ordinance, then the tax rate for those living on private ways should be reduced since the burden of maintaining streets and sidewalks on private ways will be on the residents and not the city.

963
01:10:18,934 --> 01:10:31,363
[SPEAKER_16]: As a last resort, what is the process to change a private way to a road or street so that all residents can have the same rights and services if we're going to pay the same taxes as everyone else?

964
01:10:33,226 --> 01:10:34,307
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

965
01:10:34,367 --> 01:10:41,111
[SPEAKER_17]: I know we did get our the council got a response from city engineer or tell which it basically says what he said to you.

966
01:10:41,131 --> 01:10:48,696
[SPEAKER_17]: I can just pull out that part but it did say that I've explained that the Department of Public just so it's on the record.

967
01:10:48,716 --> 01:10:49,536
[SPEAKER_17]: I know you already got this.

968
01:10:49,956 --> 01:10:58,061
[SPEAKER_17]: I've explained that the Department of Public Works does not maintain trees or sidewalks on private property except in some extreme circumstances where maintenance of a public utility is warranted.

969
01:10:58,081 --> 01:10:59,002
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

970
01:11:01,248 --> 01:11:05,391
[SPEAKER_17]: The city is working to update its website to include more information regarding private ways for residents.

971
01:11:06,111 --> 01:11:14,477
[SPEAKER_17]: A list of private and public roads is available on the website for laws surrounding what is public and what is private the bulk of the laws chapter 40 but there is also sections under chapter 81 and 83.

972
01:11:14,517 --> 01:11:26,085
[SPEAKER_17]: And I knew if utilities and sidewalks and then it goes into other sections I just wanted to Massachusetts general law so I just wanted to read what the council got from the engineer or tell but I will open it up to

973
01:11:27,486 --> 01:11:27,946
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

974
01:11:27,966 --> 01:11:28,887
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

975
01:11:29,027 --> 01:11:39,273
[SPEAKER_07]: Did, did you say that our engineer, did he put that in writing, or did he say that he called me on the phone when I spoke to that way he spoke he spoke to me Yes, those were his words.

976
01:11:39,313 --> 01:11:39,573
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

977
01:11:40,173 --> 01:11:51,080
[SPEAKER_16]: He called me because I had called and left a message to the mayor's office and I emailed and called and left a message regarding the situation of which I have copies of emails dating back two years ago about this.

978
01:11:51,860 --> 01:12:12,992
[SPEAKER_16]: And yes, he called me back and those were his words that that you, the days of knowing, knowing somebody, or the know of knowing someone or knowing people who work in City Hall, getting things done on private ways are over, and they're going forward yes that we're going by the rules on that on that point, I think the days of

979
01:12:13,965 --> 01:12:17,989
[SPEAKER_04]: anything getting done in City of Oloroa the way that this administration has been running the city.

980
01:12:18,070 --> 01:12:24,577
[SPEAKER_04]: And I thank you for bringing some of these issues up because they're issues that have been going on for a long time.

981
01:12:25,337 --> 01:12:29,001
[SPEAKER_07]: Now the area you're talking about, is it posing a threat or will it pose a threat?

982
01:12:29,662 --> 01:12:30,662
[SPEAKER_07]: for residents?

983
01:12:30,982 --> 01:12:31,563
[SPEAKER_16]: Absolutely.

984
01:12:32,083 --> 01:12:33,963
[SPEAKER_16]: Because this has been going on for over three years.

985
01:12:34,164 --> 01:12:34,864
[SPEAKER_16]: I have pitches.

986
01:12:35,384 --> 01:12:37,565
[SPEAKER_16]: I have emails dating back from then.

987
01:12:38,385 --> 01:12:40,226
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's actually a bump.

988
01:12:40,286 --> 01:12:43,087
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, this is a tree that the city planted.

989
01:12:43,587 --> 01:12:52,010
[SPEAKER_16]: And my my issue with this is the city can't pick and choose who's in administration decide what they're going to do and what year they're going to do it all depends who's in office.

990
01:12:52,850 --> 01:12:56,131
[SPEAKER_16]: And if you planted the trees that you're responsible to take care of it, you

991
01:12:56,451 --> 01:13:02,233
[SPEAKER_16]: It was a city street when I said that to Owen he basically so I don't have no record that I says was not convenient.

992
01:13:02,273 --> 01:13:03,793
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, of course he has a record for that.

993
01:13:03,853 --> 01:13:05,814
[SPEAKER_17]: But I think yeah, and this email says it was done.

994
01:13:05,834 --> 01:13:08,075
[SPEAKER_17]: He has a record of being donated 30 plus years ago.

995
01:13:08,415 --> 01:13:10,775
[SPEAKER_17]: But just okay, but that's not what he told me.

996
01:13:10,895 --> 01:13:11,376
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, yeah.

997
01:13:11,536 --> 01:13:11,976
[SPEAKER_17]: So here's our issue.

998
01:13:15,937 --> 01:13:21,620
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, our problem is we don't have a city solicitor that we could speak to because I find this a bother.

999
01:13:21,720 --> 01:13:22,701
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's dangerous.

1000
01:13:22,801 --> 01:13:39,490
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, and we also talked this council's also talked about the because we have so many roads that are private, we lose a lot of money that that are directly assigned from the state and the federal government.

1001
01:13:40,525 --> 01:13:48,291
[SPEAKER_07]: because when they look at Medford, it looks like we have X amount of miles of road because we have so many miles of private ways.

1002
01:13:48,391 --> 01:14:05,945
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that's something I believe we brought up in resolution to look into the process of taking back those roads and those streets for the fact that it would bring in more money to refurbish our communities, you know, dire need for the reconstruction redevelopment of those roads.

1003
01:14:07,165 --> 01:14:10,607
[SPEAKER_07]: that's something that you know, we can revisit as a council later on.

1004
01:14:11,648 --> 01:14:17,350
[SPEAKER_16]: But and I will add if I may, I don't mean to interrupt when I when the mayor called me as well.

1005
01:14:18,091 --> 01:14:29,736
[SPEAKER_16]: And and I and I explained everything that Bowen said and and she concurred and I raised those these points to her and I says about paying the same taxes, you know, it's not right.

1006
01:14:29,756 --> 01:14:31,157
[SPEAKER_16]: You provide the same services.

1007
01:14:32,077 --> 01:14:34,778
[SPEAKER_16]: And I says, Oh, we should be paying a different tax rate.

1008
01:14:34,838 --> 01:14:35,879
[SPEAKER_16]: And she says, Oh,

1009
01:14:36,401 --> 01:14:43,815
[SPEAKER_16]: We do know how many, how many private ways we have in the city, like another way implying it would be a revenue issue for the city.

1010
01:14:44,369 --> 01:14:53,852
[SPEAKER_16]: if we were to give if we were to do a tax reduction for those living on private ways, if the city is not going to provide the same services as those living on streets.

1011
01:14:54,593 --> 01:14:55,913
[SPEAKER_16]: So I know this.

1012
01:14:56,013 --> 01:14:56,733
[SPEAKER_07]: I know it's a law.

1013
01:14:57,274 --> 01:15:04,076
[SPEAKER_07]: We know that we know that that's the city's law, but which is that private ways what we can do what we can't do.

1014
01:15:04,516 --> 01:15:09,158
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I have neighbors that live in a private way that pulled their money to resurface their whole street.

1015
01:15:09,238 --> 01:15:12,039
[SPEAKER_07]: So I know there are different rules and regulations, but

1016
01:15:12,972 --> 01:15:17,375
[SPEAKER_07]: I think when it comes to safety, I think that might supersede any issue or concern.

1017
01:15:17,395 --> 01:15:19,176
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why we've been told that.

1018
01:15:19,416 --> 01:15:23,179
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we've been told that so I don't know what if it is exactly that.

1019
01:15:23,299 --> 01:15:24,680
[SPEAKER_16]: But that's the point of it all.

1020
01:15:25,380 --> 01:15:28,002
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm aware of what the law states about private ways.

1021
01:15:28,322 --> 01:15:42,459
[SPEAKER_16]: But you just can't pick and choose, even at Aggie know acknowledge this that it was a problem years back I have the emails printed out it was in the mail, but you can't all of a sudden decide you're not going to change it because of your changing your mind.

1022
01:15:42,499 --> 01:15:45,023
[SPEAKER_07]: What we're saying is this council is supporting

1023
01:15:45,703 --> 01:15:49,847
[SPEAKER_07]: the fact to look at changing all our private ways to public ways.

1024
01:15:50,367 --> 01:15:54,750
[SPEAKER_16]: That would be wonderful because we're all paying taxes and we all deserve the same services.

1025
01:15:54,971 --> 01:16:08,081
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that for your issue right now, I think that we need to have, you know, somebody from DPW to go down and look at that, that area where you're talking about and to address safety issues.

1026
01:16:08,141 --> 01:16:11,484
[SPEAKER_07]: And if it's safety issues, I believe that supersedes any

1027
01:16:13,093 --> 01:16:20,743
[SPEAKER_16]: According to the Aggie in the city two years ago, it's and I even called the city, the sidewalk or the street department, they said it's on the list.

1028
01:16:20,803 --> 01:16:24,868
[SPEAKER_16]: It's been on the my, my sidewalk has been on the list for two years.

1029
01:16:25,308 --> 01:16:27,952
[SPEAKER_16]: And every year I have to call and say why isn't it been done.

1030
01:16:28,272 --> 01:16:29,112
[SPEAKER_07]: So maybe we could do this.

1031
01:16:29,152 --> 01:16:46,097
[SPEAKER_07]: Why don't we, why don't I make a motion that, okay, so what I'll do is we'll put a resolution in, I'll talk to the city clerk that will ask the residents to come up, the city engineer and a representative from the city that could come up and speak to safety issues.

1032
01:16:46,378 --> 01:16:57,521
[SPEAKER_07]: We can't speak on the law unless we, as a council, put something forth, which that might be something we look at, but I think right now in the urgency of this issue, that if it's a safety concern that we bring the people together

1033
01:16:57,961 --> 01:17:04,464
[SPEAKER_07]: in the resolution at an open meeting, so we can get to the bottom of this, because what I don't want to hear is God forbid tomorrow.

1034
01:17:05,185 --> 01:17:22,333
[SPEAKER_16]: We have a neighbor that walks down the street breaks an ankle, and you come back and say listen we told you so I do have it all right and I exactly that and I thank you for that, but on a larger scale I would hope the council considers a method for both the city and for the residents to be able to find a resolution so that

1035
01:17:23,013 --> 01:17:38,365
[SPEAKER_07]: the city, which to the benefit of the city that we're all streets and you get the revenue from the state, and we all get the same services and again there's a catch 22 we asked for this already, but because we don't have a city attorney that works with the council, we can't get the work done.

1036
01:17:39,145 --> 01:17:43,388
[SPEAKER_07]: So if we want it done, we have to hire KP law that works for the mayor.

1037
01:17:44,249 --> 01:17:49,632
[SPEAKER_07]: and give them thousands of dollars to come back and give us the mayor's response of what the answer is.

1038
01:17:49,652 --> 01:17:51,632
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, maybe the next administration can handle this.

1039
01:17:51,672 --> 01:17:52,033
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1040
01:17:52,053 --> 01:17:52,693
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's hope so.

1041
01:17:52,793 --> 01:18:02,998
[SPEAKER_17]: And then just just quickly to build on Councilor Scarpelli's point, just because I live on a private way and I've asked this too, I'm sure you've asked similar is where I've been told that public safety, you know, why does my street get plowed if I live on a private way?

1042
01:18:03,038 --> 01:18:04,578
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's because it's a public safety thing.

1043
01:18:04,618 --> 01:18:07,840
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think some clarity on why is I mean, you know,

1044
01:18:08,598 --> 01:18:08,878
[SPEAKER_17]: it's not fair.

1045
01:18:08,898 --> 01:18:09,258
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not fair.

1046
01:18:09,298 --> 01:18:14,179
[SPEAKER_17]: Plowing is public safety, but trip and fall isn't so trying to understand where is the line being drawn?

1047
01:18:14,599 --> 01:18:17,460
[SPEAKER_17]: That's so we are just is dying.

1048
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:19,140
[SPEAKER_15]: We Councilor favor put a resolution on this.

1049
01:18:19,180 --> 01:18:19,680
[SPEAKER_15]: We met on it.

1050
01:18:19,780 --> 01:18:21,140
[SPEAKER_15]: October 25th of last year.

1051
01:18:21,660 --> 01:18:23,041
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd recommend watching it.

1052
01:18:23,541 --> 01:18:29,462
[SPEAKER_15]: I hate to be the bummer in the room because I don't agree that it's not fair, but it's not the city's choice.

1053
01:18:29,522 --> 01:18:30,862
[SPEAKER_15]: We're bound by state

1054
01:18:36,803 --> 01:18:42,145
[SPEAKER_15]: So I would really recommend watching the recording of our October 25th Subcommittee on Ordinances and Rules meeting.

1055
01:18:42,185 --> 01:18:45,946
[SPEAKER_15]: There's also a written transcript in our November 15th council records.

1056
01:18:46,526 --> 01:18:57,269
[SPEAKER_15]: Technically the city can, there is a process, the only process the state allows for a city to accept a private way as a public way is if the public way meets the standards of the state for a public way.

1057
01:18:57,649 --> 01:19:03,231
[SPEAKER_15]: But the residents would have to collectively pool and pay to upgrade the private way to meet those standards.

1058
01:19:03,591 --> 01:19:06,293
[SPEAKER_15]: before the city can legally accept the road as a public way.

1059
01:19:06,654 --> 01:19:08,215
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's kind of the catch-22.

1060
01:19:09,276 --> 01:19:11,978
[SPEAKER_15]: In terms of the public safety issue, we had the discussion on it.

1061
01:19:12,558 --> 01:19:20,385
[SPEAKER_15]: The city, because there is public access to the private way, the city voluntarily provides certain public safety service, but it is voluntary.

1062
01:19:20,405 --> 01:19:23,347
[SPEAKER_15]: The state of the city is technically under no legal obligation to provide them.

1063
01:19:24,748 --> 01:19:30,112
[SPEAKER_15]: The police department has also had a number of meetings that are recorded about parking issues on private ways.

1064
01:19:31,089 --> 01:19:39,112
[SPEAKER_15]: residents on private ways, as long as they have the agreement of all the butters and that's probably why he recommended looking at the real estate thing to see exactly who has the legal rights to the private way.

1065
01:19:39,572 --> 01:19:52,077
[SPEAKER_15]: If everyone agrees you can put up speed bumps stop signs whatever you want, and the city can't say yes or no to that because it's a private way, but a lot of our private ways don't have sewerage systems drainage systems.

1066
01:19:52,617 --> 01:19:58,363
[SPEAKER_15]: things of that nature, which are basic requirements under state law for acceptance of a private way as a public way.

1067
01:19:59,664 --> 01:20:02,467
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, I'm not going to justify the response that you got.

1068
01:20:02,487 --> 01:20:03,328
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think it's right.

1069
01:20:03,388 --> 01:20:07,813
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not going to say that it's a fair thing that the way that private ways are treated relative to public ways.

1070
01:20:08,233 --> 01:20:09,874
[SPEAKER_15]: but it goes beyond the city of Medford.

1071
01:20:10,815 --> 01:20:27,226
[SPEAKER_15]: One of the reasons we have a lot of folks on public ways waiting 2, 3, 5, 10 years on sidewalk lists as well, it's because we have $100 million backlog and we have a report that says we need to spend $10 million a year, we spend $1 million a year, and there's not $9 million to cut somewhere else to fund roads and sidewalks.

1072
01:20:27,286 --> 01:20:36,873
[SPEAKER_15]: I think if we had a large community conversation around private ways and we're willing to raise $50 million, $100 million to turn every private way up to code to bring it into a public way,

1073
01:20:37,445 --> 01:20:44,247
[SPEAKER_15]: That would be a path forward but there's no path forward that doesn't cost either the butters a significant amount of money or the community is significant amount of money.

1074
01:20:44,647 --> 01:20:56,890
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's the catch 22 or and so I do feel for you I think obviously if there's public safety issues the city should come out and try to address them but but state law says that the city doesn't actually have to and it's the responsibility of the private butters to handle.

1075
01:20:57,670 --> 01:21:08,105
[SPEAKER_16]: I hear you I've done my research and I'm well aware of everything you mentioned but I there are some discretionary elements in there that you, as you noted in your comments, yeah, that the city's

1076
01:21:08,708 --> 01:21:21,032
[SPEAKER_16]: there's a lot of discretionary decisions in there, and that's where I say depends on your administration, what they're going to do with the time who's in office.

1077
01:21:21,792 --> 01:21:27,814
[SPEAKER_16]: And as far as the city's lines, I mean, I think there's a resolution to all this.

1078
01:21:27,974 --> 01:21:30,734
[SPEAKER_16]: There's certainly ways to get it done.

1079
01:21:33,135 --> 01:21:48,899
[SPEAKER_16]: That's our job to do so I'm not going to sit here and speak for other but I think this impacts a lot of people in the city, because, as like the mayor said I don't know how many private ways there are but she implied that there are a significant amount of private ways which means there are a lot of residents who are very interested in this fact.

1080
01:21:49,099 --> 01:21:55,701
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, and everybody has to and drain lines so I'm sure there's a way to make these into public streets.

1081
01:21:57,325 --> 01:21:59,171
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.

1082
01:21:59,853 --> 01:22:04,708
[SPEAKER_04]: So ultimately what I'm hearing is this ultimately started three years ago with a request to have a tree removed.

1083
01:22:06,831 --> 01:22:07,451
[SPEAKER_04]: actually a sidewalk.

1084
01:22:07,491 --> 01:22:10,352
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, the city plant, the city's planted that tree.

1085
01:22:10,593 --> 01:22:13,714
[SPEAKER_04]: And then for three years at a time, you were told you're on the list.

1086
01:22:13,774 --> 01:22:13,974
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1087
01:22:14,034 --> 01:22:14,855
[SPEAKER_16]: And I have emails.

1088
01:22:14,935 --> 01:22:21,678
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you finally, actually, you finally came in touch with somebody in city hall and Owen that told you the truth after three years, right?

1089
01:22:21,758 --> 01:22:22,599
[SPEAKER_04]: Said, we're not going to do that.

1090
01:22:22,819 --> 01:22:23,159
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

1091
01:22:23,339 --> 01:22:27,501
[SPEAKER_04]: They put you on the list and they kept telling you they're going to do it for three years.

1092
01:22:27,521 --> 01:22:28,682
[SPEAKER_04]: And they dragged you around for three years.

1093
01:22:28,702 --> 01:22:30,023
[SPEAKER_04]: And you finally found someone that told you the truth.

1094
01:22:30,483 --> 01:22:47,942
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, now, ultimately, an experienced public administrator, Madam President, to something like a sidewalk panel and a tree root to make a resident on the street that pays a lot of money in taxes very happy would be as an experienced public administrator, go to Eversource,

1095
01:22:49,725 --> 01:22:57,111
[SPEAKER_04]: and leverage your power with levers ever source to do some community mitigation, because that neighborhood has been under construction for the better part of five years.

1096
01:22:57,972 --> 01:23:00,174
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what an experienced public administrator would have done.

1097
01:23:00,634 --> 01:23:10,383
[SPEAKER_04]: And it wouldn't have had to elevate to this point where you're wasting your time coming up here to the city council because you've been making phone calls for years and years and doing emails for years and years and not getting a good response.

1098
01:23:10,843 --> 01:23:21,308
[SPEAKER_04]: an experienced public administrator, Madam President, would have reached out to their partners in government who are doing construction projects in the area and leverage that relationship to provide community and neighborhood mitigation.

1099
01:23:22,008 --> 01:23:25,150
[SPEAKER_04]: Something that I've been calling for for a very long time.

1100
01:23:25,170 --> 01:23:30,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Something that I've spoke to the DPW commissioner about at length on a number of occasions.

1101
01:23:32,013 --> 01:23:35,195
[SPEAKER_04]: So when I hear these stories and these reoccurring themes,

1102
01:23:36,326 --> 01:23:53,976
[SPEAKER_04]: in these issues that keep coming up and issues that we as a council have provided solutions for the administration, but the administration does not respond to us, does not give us the time of day, does not provide us with the tools, materials and equipment necessary to be successful in representing someone like Lisa.

1103
01:23:55,076 --> 01:23:56,397
[SPEAKER_04]: It's shameful, it really is.

1104
01:23:56,577 --> 01:23:58,858
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the cycle that we're in right now.

1105
01:23:58,978 --> 01:24:03,641
[SPEAKER_04]: There are revenue issues, but ultimately what I'm hearing is I'm not gonna do it because I don't have to.

1106
01:24:04,869 --> 01:24:06,538
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, I'm not gonna do it because I don't have to.

1107
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:08,025
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, for 28 years.

1108
01:24:09,563 --> 01:24:12,324
[SPEAKER_04]: someone did it, and no one made a big stink about it.

1109
01:24:12,844 --> 01:24:18,087
[SPEAKER_04]: The FBI didn't come in here and say, you can't be paving private ways, Mike McGlynn, that's against the rules.

1110
01:24:18,707 --> 01:24:22,529
[SPEAKER_04]: No one seemed to really mind too much when we were providing city services to the residents in the community.

1111
01:24:23,189 --> 01:24:36,555
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's when we see such a breakdown and degradation of the level of services that we provide, and when we're scrambling and trying to figure out how we're going to make it work, because we haven't invested the time, materials, energy, and effort, and we don't have the personnel, the qualified personnel,

1112
01:24:36,895 --> 01:24:41,277
[SPEAKER_04]: We haven't retained anybody with any institutional knowledge, and we haven't been able to track anybody.

1113
01:24:42,837 --> 01:24:50,500
[SPEAKER_04]: You get into a dire situation like this, where the ship is sinking, and now you have to make decisions and determinations like this, where you're pitting neighbor against neighbor and street against street.

1114
01:24:52,271 --> 01:24:55,935
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm pretty, I'm pretty sure most people don't know what a private way is and what a public way is.

1115
01:24:56,755 --> 01:25:04,643
[SPEAKER_04]: They know it's a green sign that they can turn down and take that street to get off of Winthrop Street to get the woman street if they want to, right, Wildwood Road, for example.

1116
01:25:05,123 --> 01:25:16,775
[SPEAKER_04]: So when I look at this and I hear these issues, I just find it very frustrating because a hands on public administrator, someone that wants to administer and manage would be able to address an issue like this.

1117
01:25:18,255 --> 01:25:21,078
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm sorry for your frustration.

1118
01:25:21,238 --> 01:25:25,502
[SPEAKER_04]: I like your idea personally that you know the same level of services should be provided to any street in the city.

1119
01:25:26,102 --> 01:25:36,652
[SPEAKER_04]: And I, you know, I understand that there are certain rules we can the city can also opt out of the subdivision control bar if we want to, you know, but ultimately right now my hands are a little strong.

1120
01:25:39,780 --> 01:25:41,962
[SPEAKER_04]: in a couple of different aspects in a couple different ways.

1121
01:25:42,023 --> 01:25:44,165
[SPEAKER_04]: One of them is because we don't have a partner across the hall.

1122
01:25:45,046 --> 01:25:54,316
[SPEAKER_04]: Secondly, we don't have the financial ability to turn the street into a public way tomorrow, right so anything that takes place going to take a long period of time to happen.

1123
01:25:55,197 --> 01:26:01,123
[SPEAKER_04]: If in fact it is going to happen and from what I'm understanding the city is not willing to invest that money I think we as a council are.

1124
01:26:01,704 --> 01:26:05,948
[SPEAKER_04]: We as a consulate are willing to say, you know, this sidewalk panel should be picked up, this tree should be taken care of.

1125
01:26:06,349 --> 01:26:07,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if the tree falls down, what's going to happen?

1126
01:26:07,770 --> 01:26:08,771
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to hit your house, right?

1127
01:26:08,791 --> 01:26:10,573
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're going to have a problem.

1128
01:26:10,633 --> 01:26:12,575
[SPEAKER_04]: If someone slips and falls in front of the house, who do they sue?

1129
01:26:12,595 --> 01:26:13,276
[SPEAKER_04]: Do they sue the city?

1130
01:26:13,296 --> 01:26:15,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Or do they sue you for the sidewalk panel?

1131
01:26:16,930 --> 01:26:21,693
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, if the tree was planted by the city and you caused it, I would be, say, the city.

1132
01:26:22,233 --> 01:26:24,975
[SPEAKER_16]: But again, there's a lot of discretion here.

1133
01:26:24,995 --> 01:26:32,760
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, the law can state one thing, but as I spoke to the state already about this matter, and there's a lot of discretion at the city.

1134
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:36,562
[SPEAKER_16]: The law says one thing, but the city can do whatever they choose at their discretion.

1135
01:26:36,962 --> 01:26:43,226
[SPEAKER_16]: So if I'm paying taxes the same as everybody else, I expect the same services as everyone else.

1136
01:26:43,546 --> 01:26:43,947
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think

1137
01:26:44,607 --> 01:26:50,330
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think many residents who live on private ways are aware of these differences and what the law state.

1138
01:26:50,350 --> 01:27:00,996
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think if they are aware that they are not being treated the same and not being have the same same rights to the same services, I think you're going to hear a lot of loud voices.

1139
01:27:01,176 --> 01:27:03,257
[SPEAKER_04]: What else you're going to see is a devaluation of your property.

1140
01:27:06,087 --> 01:27:09,790
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you have the that's the reason for that.

1141
01:27:09,890 --> 01:27:12,632
[SPEAKER_16]: We have to pay for our maintaining our streets.

1142
01:27:13,252 --> 01:27:19,276
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's an expense that now we have to incur and where will we get the money pay for I'm, I'm, I'm paying the city.

1143
01:27:23,179 --> 01:27:27,462
[SPEAKER_16]: doing it, then I'm not paying you that money for far right because I have to pay for it myself.

1144
01:27:27,763 --> 01:27:28,503
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, right.

1145
01:27:29,104 --> 01:27:30,845
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you for coming up and thank you.

1146
01:27:30,865 --> 01:27:33,747
[SPEAKER_04]: I certainly share some of your concerns and something I'm looking forward to working on.

1147
01:27:35,071 --> 01:27:35,854
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1148
01:27:35,914 --> 01:27:38,121
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Madam President.

1149
01:27:38,141 --> 01:27:39,124
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for coming down.

1150
01:27:39,144 --> 01:27:40,087
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you reach out to me.

1151
01:27:41,311 --> 01:27:42,133
[SPEAKER_02]: I live in a private way.

1152
01:27:44,007 --> 01:27:49,689
[SPEAKER_02]: And I challenge you to come down my street, and I know somebody, me, I can't even get my own street fixed.

1153
01:27:50,389 --> 01:28:03,193
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know when the rules changed, because in previous administrations, DPW always came down and they did whatever they had to do to compensate the neighbors.

1154
01:28:05,962 --> 01:28:18,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Back in the old days, they used to have a program where the city paid for half for the people of private ways city paid for half in the residents paid for half and most of the residents didn't mind doing it because they understood all those have gone.

1155
01:28:19,936 --> 01:28:20,677
[SPEAKER_02]: by the wayside.

1156
01:28:20,817 --> 01:28:24,678
[SPEAKER_02]: We talk about needing hundreds of millions of dollars in street repair.

1157
01:28:25,079 --> 01:28:30,761
[SPEAKER_02]: I guarantee you, if you went to most of the neighbors in the private ways, you said, would you be willing to pay half?

1158
01:28:30,821 --> 01:28:35,283
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think I paid, it was like eight or $900 and I had a nice street.

1159
01:28:35,503 --> 01:28:38,865
[SPEAKER_02]: I guarantee you, if you went to everybody on a private way and you asked them to do that,

1160
01:28:39,780 --> 01:28:45,083
[SPEAKER_02]: they would agree, and the city would have half the burden lifted on this.

1161
01:28:45,383 --> 01:28:49,125
[SPEAKER_02]: So these rules only changed when this administration came in.

1162
01:28:49,505 --> 01:29:03,433
[SPEAKER_02]: So they weren't rules before, but it says here on the Mass General Law that temporary repairs in private ways, the city may make temporary repairs in private ways, provided that

1163
01:29:04,491 --> 01:29:07,633
[SPEAKER_02]: A private way has been open for public use for more than five years.

1164
01:29:07,933 --> 01:29:10,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Winford Way's been there forever, as long as I can remember.

1165
01:29:10,814 --> 01:29:15,757
[SPEAKER_02]: So, for all I want to say, what he said there, should be ashamed of himself to even say that.

1166
01:29:17,357 --> 01:29:21,079
[SPEAKER_02]: He works for you, works for you, and the taxpayers of this community.

1167
01:29:21,379 --> 01:29:24,541
[SPEAKER_02]: And that answer was unacceptable in any way.

1168
01:29:24,581 --> 01:29:28,263
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care if you worked in the private sector, that was an unacceptable answer.

1169
01:29:29,389 --> 01:29:31,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Government should be here to help us, help the people.

1170
01:29:33,531 --> 01:29:35,531
[SPEAKER_02]: No shouldn't exist in our book yet.

1171
01:29:37,412 --> 01:29:39,133
[SPEAKER_02]: I say, I don't know what to tell you on this.

1172
01:29:39,233 --> 01:29:47,156
[SPEAKER_02]: I brought this up, like Councilor Baird said some months ago, and they're just saying, we're not gonna do this anymore.

1173
01:29:47,836 --> 01:29:51,298
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm under the belief, I told you this personally, that

1174
01:29:52,460 --> 01:29:59,183
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're not going to get the same services that every other resident didn't get in the city gets, you should not be paying the same taxes.

1175
01:29:59,703 --> 01:30:05,526
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, no reason why they can't come down there for it isn't that thousands of people are asking to fix things.

1176
01:30:05,846 --> 01:30:08,987
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like as Councilman mentioned.

1177
01:30:09,227 --> 01:30:17,911
[SPEAKER_02]: These are solutions that could be done without causing headaches, so I don't know what the problem is, and why the rules change on the dis administration.

1178
01:30:21,128 --> 01:30:22,629
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councillor say, Thank you.

1179
01:30:22,689 --> 01:30:29,494
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll be brief, since I think you'll find that we're pretty unified on, you know, you should be getting the services that you're paying for.

1180
01:30:30,175 --> 01:30:36,480
[SPEAKER_14]: And, um, I mean, we have a problem with attitude in how we deliver city services.

1181
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:44,806
[SPEAKER_14]: We have a problem funding and meeting the requirements to even stay level with the bad quality of the roads that are out there and sidewalks.

1182
01:30:46,487 --> 01:30:56,314
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I'm with counselor care of yellow I mean we can't just face a problem say oh well we're going to put our hands up and give up, right, we need to be innovative with how we solve that problem, those problems.

1183
01:30:57,054 --> 01:31:03,159
[SPEAKER_14]: And, I mean, I was, I was going to say something like cancer caribou, we need to try to create a program to

1184
01:31:03,779 --> 01:31:05,341
[SPEAKER_14]: Educate people living on.

1185
01:31:05,361 --> 01:31:06,122
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1186
01:31:06,722 --> 01:31:23,000
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, I mean, even just letting you guys know how to turn a private way into a public way right that's information I'm sure you have to dig for that information and you have to ask a lot of people for that information, you know that that should just be clear on the city website or when you move into Medford as a homeowner.

1187
01:31:24,302 --> 01:31:26,864
[SPEAKER_14]: on a private way, you should have that information right in front of you.

1188
01:31:28,205 --> 01:31:31,688
[SPEAKER_14]: And we need to do better communication as a city to get to that point.

1189
01:31:31,708 --> 01:31:37,292
[SPEAKER_14]: And we need to be realistic about how we spend that money and how we find that money.

1190
01:31:38,033 --> 01:31:48,041
[SPEAKER_14]: We spend a lot of time on the council talking about smaller amounts, but something as big as fixing the sidewalks and the roads in our city, including the private ways, I mean, that's a huge dollar amount.

1191
01:31:48,061 --> 01:31:52,405
[SPEAKER_14]: We have to be honest about that and honest to say, we can't do it overnight, we can't do it tonight.

1192
01:31:52,745 --> 01:31:53,505
[SPEAKER_14]: But what's the plan?

1193
01:31:53,966 --> 01:31:55,106
[SPEAKER_14]: What's the plan to get there?

1194
01:31:55,406 --> 01:32:00,088
[SPEAKER_14]: How do we have that hard conversation about raising the funds that we need to get there in the first place?

1195
01:32:00,549 --> 01:32:03,810
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm sorry for your situation.

1196
01:32:04,810 --> 01:32:10,273
[SPEAKER_14]: We should look at the discretion and try to find a solution for you.

1197
01:32:10,513 --> 01:32:11,633
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I'm totally with you.

1198
01:32:12,954 --> 01:32:33,847
[SPEAKER_16]: at this point, I'm not here necessarily for myself at this point, because after doing more exploration and looking into this matter, this has opened my eyes to realize to to see that this is a bigger problem, not just for myself, but for every person who lives on a private way, which comes to find out is a significant amount of residents in this city.

1199
01:32:34,187 --> 01:32:37,689
[SPEAKER_16]: So I don't think residents in the city realize what what the

1200
01:32:37,989 --> 01:32:44,012
[SPEAKER_16]: what the situation is, when you live on this and the implications of living on a private way.

1201
01:32:44,112 --> 01:32:44,312
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1202
01:32:44,432 --> 01:32:58,480
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm hoping to educate everybody here, who's listening, hopefully tonight, and have people speak up because if we're paying taxes for these service, we should get the same services as everyone else on the street or otherwise we deserve a different tax rate.

1203
01:32:58,882 --> 01:33:03,103
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we need to be really transparent about what, you know, what our policies are and everything.

1204
01:33:03,123 --> 01:33:05,983
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's like the first step of the problem too, right?

1205
01:33:06,403 --> 01:33:15,185
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, you might not agree with the mayor's, the administration's position on an issue and we might not agree either, but we shouldn't have to dig to find out what the position is either.

1206
01:33:15,405 --> 01:33:17,905
[SPEAKER_16]: We shouldn't have to make those- But you can't flip flop.

1207
01:33:17,925 --> 01:33:23,506
[SPEAKER_16]: You can't flip flop on years of doing things one way and then all of a sudden administration today decides to do it another.

1208
01:33:24,386 --> 01:33:27,487
[SPEAKER_16]: You can't be inconsistent on services that you provide.

1209
01:33:27,947 --> 01:33:28,207
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1210
01:33:28,387 --> 01:33:33,451
[SPEAKER_14]: And honestly, even if the mayor does that, right, it should be super transparent.

1211
01:33:34,071 --> 01:33:36,513
[SPEAKER_14]: All of us should know that there was a change in policy.

1212
01:33:36,673 --> 01:33:47,821
[SPEAKER_14]: And that way, you know, people living on private roads, private ways can come to City Hall and, you know, protest it or petition it or, you know, we should have that transparency in government.

1213
01:33:48,322 --> 01:33:49,182
[SPEAKER_14]: It's super important.

1214
01:33:49,222 --> 01:33:49,543
[SPEAKER_14]: So I

1215
01:33:50,303 --> 01:33:53,944
[SPEAKER_14]: I hope that you find a resolution to your thing.

1216
01:33:54,364 --> 01:33:55,544
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, you're right.

1217
01:33:55,965 --> 01:34:07,628
[SPEAKER_14]: Much of Medford lives on private ways and we need to, I mean, it's an issue that we haven't talked about, frankly enough, but this city council has been pretty proactive on trying to find a solution.

1218
01:34:09,408 --> 01:34:09,728
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1219
01:34:10,028 --> 01:34:10,308
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1220
01:34:10,348 --> 01:34:14,269
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Lisa.

1221
01:34:15,110 --> 01:34:16,590
[SPEAKER_15]: Just really quickly, like again, I think

1222
01:34:18,238 --> 01:34:30,213
[SPEAKER_15]: We all agree that this is a situation that the city doesn't benefit from it anyway, but I think the scale and scope is a little out of, you know, if we had if all the private ways in the city was became public ways, the state would send us like $400,000 more a year.

1223
01:34:32,191 --> 01:34:50,633
[SPEAKER_15]: We'd be able to plant like three trees fix for sidewalk panels I mean it's, it's, it's, that's the issue, you know state hasn't doubled hasn't hasn't increased chapter 90 in years, the city's not putting really any money, you know when we talk about paying for services quite frankly city property tax money mostly doesn't go to roads and sidewalks.

1224
01:34:51,488 --> 01:34:52,449
[SPEAKER_15]: mostly goes to everything else.

1225
01:34:52,469 --> 01:35:04,956
[SPEAKER_15]: The only thing that's really going to road and sidewalks is chapter 90, which comes from the state, which is tax money to state tax money, but is 10 times less than the amount that we should be spending on roads and sidewalk repairs.

1226
01:35:05,036 --> 01:35:10,078
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm guessing now that I think about it more, that the road and sidewalk analysis is probably only for public ways.

1227
01:35:10,759 --> 01:35:16,522
[SPEAKER_15]: So the number there that's 130 million may well be 200 million if you add the 30% of the city that's private ways.

1228
01:35:18,755 --> 01:35:27,222
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, I think we brought up in that meeting with the DPW Commissioner, you know, look at our existing ordinance, what can it do?

1229
01:35:27,242 --> 01:35:39,252
[SPEAKER_15]: It pretty much goes to the extent of state law and says the city, you know, we, the City Council absolutely authorizes the city administration to, to fund the programs that Councilor Caravaglia was talking about.

1230
01:35:39,773 --> 01:35:43,756
[SPEAKER_15]: We could strengthen that ordinance even more if the mayor doesn't appropriate money to that.

1231
01:35:44,320 --> 01:35:50,565
[SPEAKER_15]: doesn't, you know, we don't even have legal authority to move money around to make or fund that, which is another fight that we're fighting.

1232
01:35:51,125 --> 01:35:57,390
[SPEAKER_15]: And we're fighting about a capital needs assessment, so that we know the amount of needs so that we can say, okay, it is $200 million.

1233
01:35:58,191 --> 01:36:02,775
[SPEAKER_15]: If we did this amount each year, it would take us 12 years to get to a state of good repair for everybody.

1234
01:36:02,835 --> 01:36:06,598
[SPEAKER_15]: Or if it is 100 million to convert every private way to public ways, if we spent

1235
01:36:07,098 --> 01:36:09,339
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, 8 million a year, we'll get there in 15 years.

1236
01:36:09,399 --> 01:36:11,399
[SPEAKER_15]: And you know, those those are, that's what we need to do.

1237
01:36:11,899 --> 01:36:17,201
[SPEAKER_15]: But those are the answers that we don't even have, like, not only we know the problem, we know, we'd like to fix it.

1238
01:36:17,641 --> 01:36:22,782
[SPEAKER_15]: But the will to actually find the answer to the question, how much does it cost?

1239
01:36:22,842 --> 01:36:27,083
[SPEAKER_15]: And how much do we need to invest over what period of time to achieve our goal to fix the problem?

1240
01:36:27,863 --> 01:36:28,984
[SPEAKER_15]: We don't have that answer.

1241
01:36:29,444 --> 01:36:30,604
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's the answer we need.

1242
01:36:31,020 --> 01:36:53,006
[SPEAKER_15]: Then we can go to everybody in the city and say hey, we have this private ways problem, it'll cost $8 million a year, do we all think we should spend $8 million a year to fund that and we can actually have that kind of community conversation, but that's the real issue you know this council could pass the best ordinance in the world next week on this question, and it won't force any single hand to appropriate a single dime.

1243
01:36:53,886 --> 01:36:57,228
[SPEAKER_15]: to match private money to fix private ways.

1244
01:36:58,389 --> 01:37:10,397
[SPEAKER_15]: So until there's the willingness to like actually from the city administration side say okay, we fully acknowledge that we have this massive amount of capital need and operating need to effectively fund the city.

1245
01:37:11,378 --> 01:37:21,904
[SPEAKER_15]: and this is how much it would cost, and this is how much it would cost us to get there if we break it down over a long period of time, then this council is going to be passing ordinances that the mayor doesn't fund or enforce.

1246
01:37:22,164 --> 01:37:24,085
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's kind of the catch-22.

1247
01:37:24,165 --> 01:37:36,212
[SPEAKER_15]: Again, I hate to be like Debbie Downer over here, because I do think we should try to do something to fix the problem, but we don't even have the authority to move money around within the existing budget to fix one road, never mind 30% of the streets.

1248
01:37:36,493 --> 01:37:38,934
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's a difficult situation.

1249
01:37:39,014 --> 01:37:39,754
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Madam President.

1250
01:37:39,834 --> 01:37:46,016
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Councilor Baez who brought up during the capital plan meeting that we're proposing projects.

1251
01:37:46,036 --> 01:37:48,877
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't even know what our capital assets are.

1252
01:37:50,357 --> 01:37:57,239
[SPEAKER_02]: How are we proposing a capital plan when we haven't figured out what our capital assets and what it is?

1253
01:37:57,559 --> 01:38:00,660
[SPEAKER_02]: So we know where to allocate money.

1254
01:38:01,060 --> 01:38:05,161
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just allocating money to things in the sky without even figuring out where they really need to go.

1255
01:38:05,722 --> 01:38:06,522
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the real problem.

1256
01:38:07,625 --> 01:38:09,465
[SPEAKER_02]: with this whole situation, yeah.

1257
01:38:10,326 --> 01:38:11,206
[SPEAKER_02]: Not knowing anything.

1258
01:38:14,907 --> 01:38:19,588
[SPEAKER_13]: Good evening everyone, Sharon Diesso, Circuit Road in Mass Ave in Medford.

1259
01:38:19,928 --> 01:38:21,168
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for the time tonight.

1260
01:38:22,268 --> 01:38:26,789
[SPEAKER_13]: I had a related issue that has to do with safety on the roads.

1261
01:38:27,189 --> 01:38:31,610
[SPEAKER_13]: I do want to mention, Madam President, for one second, that I too live on a private way.

1262
01:38:32,210 --> 01:38:36,211
[SPEAKER_13]: One side of my house is on a private way and one side is on a public road.

1263
01:38:36,632 --> 01:38:39,953
[SPEAKER_13]: So there comes pros and cons when you buy the property.

1264
01:38:40,353 --> 01:38:45,515
[SPEAKER_13]: So I do sympathize with you in similar issues that do come up.

1265
01:38:46,135 --> 01:38:52,557
[SPEAKER_13]: I wanted to ask a question for a few of us who I'm friends with who they're raising the safety issue.

1266
01:38:53,051 --> 01:38:58,054
[SPEAKER_13]: We want to know the new status of the application of bike lanes.

1267
01:38:58,214 --> 01:39:04,217
[SPEAKER_13]: We heard that they are coming on Main Street in Medford and also Salem Street.

1268
01:39:04,957 --> 01:39:07,398
[SPEAKER_13]: We do have some problems with this.

1269
01:39:08,179 --> 01:39:16,043
[SPEAKER_13]: Number one, because we all agree, we hear it everywhere, it's even on ads on TV, exercise, exercise.

1270
01:39:16,828 --> 01:39:17,970
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, to lead to good health.

1271
01:39:17,990 --> 01:39:19,071
[SPEAKER_13]: We're all for bicycles.

1272
01:39:19,111 --> 01:39:22,696
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot of these bicyclists are very, very young.

1273
01:39:22,776 --> 01:39:23,757
[SPEAKER_13]: Some of them are older.

1274
01:39:23,777 --> 01:39:28,163
[SPEAKER_13]: They're choosing different modes of transportation to get to and from work.

1275
01:39:28,243 --> 01:39:32,709
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's important also just to do shopping and also just to get exercise.

1276
01:39:33,289 --> 01:39:34,711
[SPEAKER_13]: We are very, very

1277
01:39:35,705 --> 01:39:42,388
[SPEAKER_13]: opposed to the application of bike lanes on the street, like Main Street or a street like Salem Street.

1278
01:39:42,868 --> 01:39:46,130
[SPEAKER_13]: We understand that some parking spaces will be abolished.

1279
01:39:46,550 --> 01:39:51,472
[SPEAKER_13]: We also were trying to find room to even get by when cars are parked there during the day.

1280
01:39:52,046 --> 01:39:54,887
[SPEAKER_13]: businesses are going to lose meter spaces.

1281
01:39:55,687 --> 01:40:10,852
[SPEAKER_13]: Those are three issues, but the safety above all, we have no idea even when being cut off because some of these bicyclists, the great athletes, you don't mistake me, if they cut you off, et cetera, we have no way of identifying that driver.

1282
01:40:11,212 --> 01:40:15,193
[SPEAKER_13]: And the definition of it in the state is it is a vehicle.

1283
01:40:15,433 --> 01:40:17,834
[SPEAKER_13]: Bicycles are looked upon as vehicles.

1284
01:40:18,434 --> 01:40:25,618
[SPEAKER_13]: We're asking, is there a way that you can help us to promote registration plates, again, on the back of bikes?

1285
01:40:26,018 --> 01:40:27,459
[SPEAKER_13]: We used to do it when we were kids.

1286
01:40:27,539 --> 01:40:29,199
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe Ricky would remember also.

1287
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:30,820
[SPEAKER_13]: You had to get a plate for your bike.

1288
01:40:30,940 --> 01:40:37,383
[SPEAKER_13]: Every year I had to come down, pay my little $5 fee, and have a plate applied to the back of my bicycle.

1289
01:40:37,423 --> 01:40:38,444
[SPEAKER_13]: It was kind of cool.

1290
01:40:38,464 --> 01:40:41,445
[SPEAKER_13]: We used to walk each other down to City Hall to get them.

1291
01:40:42,486 --> 01:40:46,588
[SPEAKER_13]: Not only that, if somebody comes around a corner, we're not saying they're all bad.

1292
01:40:47,228 --> 01:40:48,649
[SPEAKER_13]: cycles, they're a bad motorist.

1293
01:40:49,570 --> 01:40:51,371
[SPEAKER_13]: And they just come and hit a baby carriage.

1294
01:40:51,871 --> 01:40:54,934
[SPEAKER_13]: It's coming around to go around the corner to get another bike lane.

1295
01:40:55,534 --> 01:40:56,314
[SPEAKER_13]: Who's liable?

1296
01:40:56,895 --> 01:41:00,657
[SPEAKER_13]: Do they have any way of personal insurance on themselves too?

1297
01:41:01,198 --> 01:41:02,359
[SPEAKER_13]: And if we are liable,

1298
01:41:03,119 --> 01:41:04,900
[SPEAKER_13]: Some of those bikes are very expensive.

1299
01:41:04,940 --> 01:41:06,240
[SPEAKER_13]: Like I said, they're beautiful.

1300
01:41:06,320 --> 01:41:07,201
[SPEAKER_13]: Some of them cost two and $3,000.

1301
01:41:07,241 --> 01:41:09,922
[SPEAKER_13]: There has to be a plan.

1302
01:41:09,982 --> 01:41:18,165
[SPEAKER_13]: We're very tired of the state and local governments going ahead and putting, spending money and putting the cart before the horse.

1303
01:41:18,605 --> 01:41:26,848
[SPEAKER_13]: So we've realized this is a very considerate application of you to direct us in the right way

1304
01:41:27,348 --> 01:41:36,955
[SPEAKER_13]: to find out the answers to these simple registration plates, yearly fee, and who is liable in the case of accidents with bicyclists.

1305
01:41:37,655 --> 01:41:45,941
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, on a personal note, I'd like to mention that during the last couple of months, many of us know these two individuals who did pass.

1306
01:41:46,102 --> 01:41:47,463
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd like to mention their names.

1307
01:41:48,103 --> 01:41:52,326
[SPEAKER_13]: One was an icon in Medford Square with his scaly cap and very active at St.

1308
01:41:52,386 --> 01:41:54,227
[SPEAKER_13]: Joseph Church, Anthony.

1309
01:41:55,594 --> 01:41:56,354
[SPEAKER_13]: Ranzino.

1310
01:41:57,335 --> 01:42:03,657
[SPEAKER_13]: He was very audible, very concerned about the city, and he passed with his returning cancer.

1311
01:42:04,017 --> 01:42:07,599
[SPEAKER_13]: We miss him very much at the convenience store in Modern Pastry.

1312
01:42:07,979 --> 01:42:08,879
[SPEAKER_13]: He was a great guy.

1313
01:42:08,899 --> 01:42:16,302
[SPEAKER_13]: Ricky probably knew who he was, and his family was a longtime member, too.

1314
01:42:16,985 --> 01:42:24,007
[SPEAKER_13]: The other person I'd like to mention was a classmate of mine, Ian Bosomato Esposito.

1315
01:42:24,507 --> 01:42:27,988
[SPEAKER_13]: She was a long time classmate of mine, wonderful woman.

1316
01:42:28,648 --> 01:42:33,129
[SPEAKER_13]: She was so special at MGH that the cardinal said her mass when she passed.

1317
01:42:33,589 --> 01:42:38,110
[SPEAKER_13]: She sadly went to lunch with a client, even at our age.

1318
01:42:38,510 --> 01:42:44,292
[SPEAKER_13]: She was a big administrator at Mass General Hospital and a very dear friend.

1319
01:42:44,732 --> 01:42:45,692
[SPEAKER_13]: She took a client.

1320
01:42:46,294 --> 01:42:49,076
[SPEAKER_13]: I think he was a big CEO of a company or something.

1321
01:42:49,116 --> 01:42:56,703
[SPEAKER_13]: That was her job to kind of lead them through their surgical path if they were visiting from out of town.

1322
01:42:57,304 --> 01:43:04,770
[SPEAKER_13]: And she took him to lunch and she passed out on the client lunch time.

1323
01:43:05,311 --> 01:43:07,533
[SPEAKER_13]: They had to rush her to the hospital and she didn't make it.

1324
01:43:07,973 --> 01:43:08,674
[SPEAKER_13]: She passed away.

1325
01:43:09,134 --> 01:43:11,216
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you, Ann, for your years of service.

1326
01:43:11,877 --> 01:43:13,438
[SPEAKER_13]: And thank you, Tony,

1327
01:43:14,053 --> 01:43:14,113
[SPEAKER_13]: you.

1328
01:43:14,133 --> 01:43:17,455
[SPEAKER_13]: And I want to thank you and Anthony senior for your friendship in measure too many.

1329
01:43:18,035 --> 01:43:22,618
[SPEAKER_13]: Um so I await your response on the bicycling concerns.

1330
01:43:22,678 --> 01:43:23,078
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1331
01:43:23,899 --> 01:43:24,419
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for that.

1332
01:43:25,260 --> 01:43:25,900
[SPEAKER_17]: For bike lanes.

1333
01:43:25,940 --> 01:43:26,941
[SPEAKER_17]: That would be the SAS.

1334
01:43:26,981 --> 01:43:28,702
[SPEAKER_17]: Those bike lanes that would be the traffic commission.

1335
01:43:28,742 --> 01:43:33,264
[SPEAKER_17]: They tend to run the exact same time as us, so we're usually catching up after the fact.

1336
01:43:33,604 --> 01:43:33,764
[SPEAKER_17]: Um.

1337
01:43:34,565 --> 01:43:36,826
[SPEAKER_17]: And then the registration I would assume is at the state level

1338
01:43:44,638 --> 01:43:46,119
[SPEAKER_17]: representative Garber Lee about that as well.

1339
01:43:46,699 --> 01:43:47,479
[SPEAKER_17]: I cycle to work.

1340
01:43:48,559 --> 01:43:49,339
[SPEAKER_17]: I stop all red lights.

1341
01:43:49,399 --> 01:43:51,540
[SPEAKER_17]: I do all the good things a lot of cyclists don't.

1342
01:43:52,180 --> 01:43:57,702
[SPEAKER_17]: So you know, I you know, a lot of cyclists are opposed to bad cyclists and bad drivers as well.

1343
01:43:57,782 --> 01:44:02,443
[SPEAKER_17]: So I just want to note that anyone else have anything that they know off the top of their head?

1344
01:44:04,057 --> 01:44:05,958
[SPEAKER_13]: just excuse me for one more second.

1345
01:44:05,998 --> 01:44:06,418
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1346
01:44:07,459 --> 01:44:11,061
[SPEAKER_13]: Does anyone know the status of the application of the bike lines yet?

1347
01:44:11,141 --> 01:44:14,663
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there a date when they're going to be starting or anything like that?

1348
01:44:15,143 --> 01:44:24,508
[SPEAKER_13]: And I do have one or two business friends right on Main Street who said they can come down they can attest every single day when they walk out of their business.

1349
01:44:24,969 --> 01:44:32,713
[SPEAKER_13]: A motorist is coming out of Dunkin Donuts parking lot and either having an air collision with a bicyclist or something's happened to a bicyclist or

1350
01:44:32,933 --> 01:44:34,794
[SPEAKER_13]: So, they're cracking into a park car.

1351
01:44:35,254 --> 01:44:45,659
[SPEAKER_13]: So, it needs to be addressed so you're suggesting that I just go straight to the traffic commission is that what you're saying, yeah they have they said it early they have the power over those decisions and they would know.

1352
01:44:46,299 --> 01:44:48,120
[SPEAKER_17]: I saw Councilor Cabrera raises hand I don't know.

1353
01:44:50,822 --> 01:45:06,045
[SPEAKER_02]: If you drive around the city, you'll see the temporary markings for where these bike lanes are going down on Winthrop Street, South Street, Haines Square, so there are going to be some markings.

1354
01:45:07,315 --> 01:45:18,898
[SPEAKER_02]: How would I say this downfall with this, there's gonna be a lot of parking spots are going to be taken away, especially in the Haines square area, which is a business district.

1355
01:45:19,038 --> 01:45:22,719
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, now to be a lot less parking spots and they were before.

1356
01:45:23,219 --> 01:45:26,900
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I think when that project is done I think you're going to see them.

1357
01:45:27,780 --> 01:45:29,121
[SPEAKER_02]: coming down before us about that.

1358
01:45:29,461 --> 01:45:31,222
[SPEAKER_02]: But the president is right.

1359
01:45:32,183 --> 01:45:38,447
[SPEAKER_02]: The place to go would be either the traffic engineer, which is Todd Blake, or the traffic commission to make your concerns known.

1360
01:45:38,527 --> 01:45:38,847
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1361
01:45:39,127 --> 01:45:40,708
[SPEAKER_13]: And I thank you again for your time.

1362
01:45:40,728 --> 01:45:42,269
[SPEAKER_13]: We are not opposed to progress.

1363
01:45:42,610 --> 01:45:43,810
[SPEAKER_13]: We know things change.

1364
01:45:44,071 --> 01:45:47,813
[SPEAKER_13]: And we're very happy for people who want to gain exercise during the day and evenings.

1365
01:45:48,433 --> 01:45:55,258
[SPEAKER_13]: We also want to employ the fact that many of them, I've seen them in the daytime and in the evenings, and you probably share this experience.

1366
01:45:55,918 --> 01:45:58,560
[SPEAKER_13]: there's no blinker that's working properly on their bikes.

1367
01:45:58,920 --> 01:46:00,981
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's also, you know, for their safety.

1368
01:46:01,741 --> 01:46:02,922
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, thank you very much.

1369
01:46:03,162 --> 01:46:03,542
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1370
01:46:05,243 --> 01:46:08,184
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyone else like to speak for public participation at this time?

1371
01:46:13,627 --> 01:46:15,448
[SPEAKER_17]: Bill Giglio, name and address for the record, please.

1372
01:46:16,709 --> 01:46:18,049
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, Bill Giglio, Winter Street.

1373
01:46:18,810 --> 01:46:21,371
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm calling to voice my displeasure tonight about our

1374
01:46:24,190 --> 01:46:33,976
[SPEAKER_00]: about our city council vice president using our city hall chambers this Saturday on off hours to let his friend from New Jersey use the Medford city halls for his Boston book launch.

1375
01:46:34,656 --> 01:46:37,318
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a gross abuse of power, which should not be allowed.

1376
01:46:37,338 --> 01:46:39,979
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our tax dollars being misused.

1377
01:46:40,980 --> 01:46:45,662
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I stated, this is being billed as a Boston book launch and free to the public.

1378
01:46:46,563 --> 01:46:49,685
[SPEAKER_00]: I asked that this book launch event,

1379
01:46:51,440 --> 01:46:56,041
[SPEAKER_00]: That has nothing to do with Metro be canceled or be moved to a non city owned building.

1380
01:46:56,081 --> 01:46:56,402
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1381
01:46:57,422 --> 01:46:57,762
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1382
01:46:59,022 --> 01:47:00,943
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyone else wish to speak for public participation?

1383
01:47:04,304 --> 01:47:05,504
[SPEAKER_17]: Seeing none, we are under suspension.

1384
01:47:07,927 --> 01:47:10,108
[SPEAKER_15]: that we can implement to address those things as a community.

1385
01:47:10,168 --> 01:47:12,448
[SPEAKER_15]: There will be a book discussion in the city council

1386
01:47:35,116 --> 01:47:36,437
[SPEAKER_17]: Again, we are under suspension still.

1387
01:47:36,477 --> 01:47:38,818
[SPEAKER_17]: Someone send me somewhere.

1388
01:47:41,479 --> 01:47:42,540
[SPEAKER_17]: Would you like to go back to revert?

1389
01:47:42,560 --> 01:47:48,483
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, because I'm at the end of a number of items, but you have the votes.

1390
01:47:51,084 --> 01:47:55,306
[SPEAKER_17]: I believe we have a motion from President Barris to revert to the regular order of business.

1391
01:47:55,366 --> 01:47:59,048
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion of President Barris to revert to regular order of business, seconded by Councilor Sang.

1392
01:47:59,068 --> 01:47:59,628
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor?

1393
01:48:00,208 --> 01:48:00,288
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

1394
01:48:00,348 --> 01:48:00,949
[SPEAKER_17]: All those opposed?

1395
01:48:00,989 --> 01:48:01,629
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes.

1396
01:48:02,663 --> 01:48:11,985
[SPEAKER_17]: do three dash 295 I think is the right place offered by Councillor saying be it so resolved that the city council asked the city administration for updates on fixing the potholes by George Street and Main Street.

1397
01:48:13,226 --> 01:48:19,487
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, President morale I think this is a pretty straightforward paper, it's a heavily trafficked road.

1398
01:48:19,507 --> 01:48:26,189
[SPEAKER_14]: I happen to live close ish and so I see the cars going by all the time I walk by all the time they're in the middle of the road.

1399
01:48:27,029 --> 01:48:30,310
[SPEAKER_14]: And so they could be good to ask for updates about resurfacing.

1400
01:48:30,930 --> 01:48:31,150
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1401
01:48:32,255 --> 01:48:32,976
[SPEAKER_17]: Any further discussion?

1402
01:48:35,117 --> 01:48:37,899
[SPEAKER_17]: The motion of Councilor Seng, seconded by Vice-President Behrs.

1403
01:48:37,979 --> 01:48:38,540
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor?

1404
01:48:38,560 --> 01:48:38,620
[SPEAKER_17]: Aye.

1405
01:48:39,260 --> 01:48:39,921
[SPEAKER_17]: All those opposed?

1406
01:48:39,941 --> 01:48:40,601
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes.

1407
01:48:40,621 --> 01:48:43,203
[SPEAKER_17]: 23-296 offered by Councilor Seng.

1408
01:48:43,363 --> 01:48:49,768
[SPEAKER_17]: DSO resolved that the City Council ask the City Administration for updates on fixing the potholes on Boston Ave between College Ave and Harvard Street.

1409
01:48:49,848 --> 01:48:50,389
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Seng.

1410
01:48:50,989 --> 01:48:53,911
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, I think this is a pretty straightforward paper.

1411
01:48:54,252 --> 01:48:57,374
[SPEAKER_14]: Very similar situation on Boston Ave between College and Harvard Street.

1412
01:48:59,075 --> 01:49:00,536
[SPEAKER_14]: Closer to this number one.

1413
01:49:02,458 --> 01:49:07,220
[SPEAKER_17]: for the discussion on the motion of Councilor saying second by Vice President bears all those in favor.

1414
01:49:07,780 --> 01:49:08,461
[SPEAKER_17]: All those opposed.

1415
01:49:08,501 --> 01:49:09,141
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes.

1416
01:49:10,142 --> 01:49:25,550
[SPEAKER_17]: You three dash 297 offered by Councilor saying be it so resolves the city council asked the city administration elections department and diversity, equity and inclusion department to identify, analyze and address the issues that may affect civic and political participation by immigrant communities in Medford Councilor saying, Thank you.

1417
01:49:25,670 --> 01:49:29,632
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, this is in light of the election after election report we got last week.

1418
01:49:30,072 --> 01:49:41,839
[SPEAKER_14]: um from the um election commission um you know they're they're doing a lot of work but i think um an important thing going uh they're doing a lot of important work when it comes to reaching out to um

1419
01:49:44,406 --> 01:49:55,977
[SPEAKER_14]: populations of Medford communities in Medford that aren't registered to vote or vote at the rates that we see for other groups in Medford, and they do have the right to vote and participate in our politics.

1420
01:49:56,938 --> 01:50:03,424
[SPEAKER_14]: I think, and given that there's an election coming up this fall and so the city elections tend to be

1421
01:50:04,365 --> 01:50:07,026
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, elections were immigrant community.

1422
01:50:07,066 --> 01:50:11,266
[SPEAKER_14]: These don't participate as high as, um, they perhaps should.

1423
01:50:11,906 --> 01:50:14,847
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, it would be great for them to look at it.

1424
01:50:15,027 --> 01:50:20,688
[SPEAKER_14]: And I know the Elections Commission is close with, um, the diversity, the department as well.

1425
01:50:20,828 --> 01:50:22,288
[SPEAKER_14]: And so they can collaborate on it.

1426
01:50:22,968 --> 01:50:23,649
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Seng.

1427
01:50:24,689 --> 01:50:25,369
[SPEAKER_17]: Further discussion?

1428
01:50:26,229 --> 01:50:28,549
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion of Councilor Seng, seconded by Vice President Behrs.

1429
01:50:28,669 --> 01:50:29,330
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor?

1430
01:50:29,890 --> 01:50:30,630
[SPEAKER_17]: All those opposed?

1431
01:50:30,730 --> 01:50:31,350
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes.

1432
01:50:32,572 --> 01:50:40,734
[SPEAKER_17]: 23-298 offered by Councilor Sang, whereas many residents of the City Council have expressed skepticism about the representativeness and IT security of Google Form responses.

1433
01:50:41,434 --> 01:50:58,577
[SPEAKER_17]: Be it so resolved that the City Council asks the City Administration to consider upgrading to professional community feedback and civic engagement software that is specifically designed for municipalities to receive greater amount of feedback, ensure that responses are more representative of the whole population, find points of consensus, and help residents understand policy decisions our city must make.

1434
01:50:58,657 --> 01:50:59,137
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Sang.

1435
01:50:59,758 --> 01:51:02,088
[SPEAKER_14]: I very much appreciate the administration's

1436
01:51:03,593 --> 01:51:09,256
[SPEAKER_14]: attempts to get more feedback for programs and policies and how to spend money.

1437
01:51:09,617 --> 01:51:18,021
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think when we've had that ARPA presentation, different presentations, I know this came up with the dog park situation as well.

1438
01:51:18,802 --> 01:51:30,409
[SPEAKER_14]: Those of us in the council have brought up a lot of questions with if we should really be making decisions like rule forms, given that they are not representative of our city at all.

1439
01:51:31,509 --> 01:51:32,130
[SPEAKER_14]: They leave out,

1440
01:51:34,450 --> 01:51:39,795
[SPEAKER_14]: They leave out a lot of people who aren't online on using their computers all the time.

1441
01:51:41,037 --> 01:51:53,148
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, this kind of realm of getting community feedback and public participation, creating surveys, it's actually a very well developed realm in city governments and municipal software and technology.

1442
01:51:53,669 --> 01:51:56,672
[SPEAKER_14]: And I just wanted to put forward that we explore

1443
01:51:57,252 --> 01:52:04,381
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm getting some if we are going to use Google Forms and I think it is good to get public feedback and I'm a pulse on the public.

1444
01:52:05,363 --> 01:52:05,943
[SPEAKER_14]: We do it right.

1445
01:52:06,384 --> 01:52:07,305
[SPEAKER_14]: I think, I think.

1446
01:52:08,710 --> 01:52:12,633
[SPEAKER_14]: A bunch of neighboring cities have invested in such technology.

1447
01:52:13,053 --> 01:52:18,197
[SPEAKER_14]: And actually, the benefits of the technology are more than just getting feedback.

1448
01:52:18,998 --> 01:52:29,806
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a lot of public education that can go on with it, a lot of considering more nuanced viewpoints, a greater number of viewpoints, and finding consensus between very different viewpoints as well.

1449
01:52:30,166 --> 01:52:37,032
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, this is a very well-developed part of technology that I'd be happy to take advantage of.

1450
01:52:37,492 --> 01:52:51,397
[SPEAKER_14]: But again, this is just for us to explore it instead of just putting out a Google form out there and leaving us vulnerable to potential IT security questions and questions about whether that form is actually representative of the population's view.

1451
01:52:51,997 --> 01:52:52,417
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1452
01:52:52,557 --> 01:52:53,777
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1453
01:52:54,077 --> 01:52:55,958
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Madam President.

1454
01:52:56,018 --> 01:52:58,279
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Councilor I appreciate brings forward it.

1455
01:52:59,339 --> 01:53:01,500
[SPEAKER_07]: First of all, what's frightening is we don't have an IT department.

1456
01:53:02,387 --> 01:53:03,148
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the first thing.

1457
01:53:03,288 --> 01:53:14,242
[SPEAKER_07]: First thing is that we have someone that's working I believe per diem or on a contracted basis, but we don't have an IT department, which is frightening because we can't get the answers we need.

1458
01:53:15,483 --> 01:53:15,824
[SPEAKER_07]: And again,

1459
01:53:17,192 --> 01:53:26,064
[SPEAKER_07]: appreciate what you're saying, because people have also told me in situations that the city has gone out and asked for different feedback.

1460
01:53:26,385 --> 01:53:33,495
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a group of educated method residents that send their feedback

1461
01:53:35,530 --> 01:53:42,875
[SPEAKER_07]: And with those numbers, our city officials gather that information, which that's all they have.

1462
01:53:43,816 --> 01:53:46,658
[SPEAKER_07]: And they have to make the best decisions from that group.

1463
01:53:47,258 --> 01:53:57,005
[SPEAKER_07]: What we realized is that that group doesn't truly identify the true demographics of our community.

1464
01:53:58,366 --> 01:54:03,470
[SPEAKER_07]: I think if you would probably look at most of the surveys that go out,

1465
01:54:05,278 --> 01:54:19,726
[SPEAKER_07]: and that are replied to are really from one administrator that works her tail off to do the best she can to get the information to the people that are directly involved because they're interested with her.

1466
01:54:20,667 --> 01:54:22,968
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's no fault to her.

1467
01:54:23,068 --> 01:54:24,069
[SPEAKER_07]: She's doing the best she can.

1468
01:54:24,109 --> 01:54:25,009
[SPEAKER_07]: She's doing her position.

1469
01:54:25,049 --> 01:54:33,374
[SPEAKER_07]: But I look at the rest of the city saying that when we have issues like bike lanes, for instance, when things go out, who responds?

1470
01:54:34,298 --> 01:54:36,159
[SPEAKER_07]: the bicycle commission people in the bicycle world.

1471
01:54:36,860 --> 01:54:37,040
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

1472
01:54:37,400 --> 01:54:40,263
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's what the demographic looks like what's being said.

1473
01:54:41,544 --> 01:54:47,969
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's no different than when you're trying to put a project in an area of low income.

1474
01:54:48,649 --> 01:54:56,976
[SPEAKER_07]: And when the people surveyed are the wealthy homeowners in that area that want that development or they could sell their homes for big money.

1475
01:54:57,536 --> 01:55:02,820
[SPEAKER_07]: And it just doesn't get to the people that really live in the community and have no other option

1476
01:55:03,765 --> 01:55:04,786
[SPEAKER_07]: but to live in that area.

1477
01:55:05,267 --> 01:55:11,235
[SPEAKER_07]: So I applaud this resolution and I think this is a huge problem when you look at

1478
01:55:13,515 --> 01:55:32,648
[SPEAKER_07]: a disparaging lack of true community involvement because we don't have the tools in place to get it out in, you know, maybe different languages or reaching different demographics or, again, so again, I rest with that.

1479
01:55:32,748 --> 01:55:33,308
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you.

1480
01:55:33,649 --> 01:55:33,929
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1481
01:55:34,189 --> 01:55:34,789
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Carville.

1482
01:55:35,250 --> 01:55:42,395
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Madam Mayor, and thank you, Councilor Sang, putting this on there, and Councilor Scarpelli also brought to the point.

1483
01:55:45,996 --> 01:55:51,239
[SPEAKER_02]: Not everybody has access to computers.

1484
01:55:51,679 --> 01:56:00,824
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, a survey done by the library was one of the biggest things they had there was the amount of people that go there for computer access.

1485
01:56:01,424 --> 01:56:02,365
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's time that

1486
01:56:03,755 --> 01:56:05,116
[SPEAKER_02]: every department and all these things.

1487
01:56:05,596 --> 01:56:11,978
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to start getting people back into meeting in the in the building, and then and have public meetings.

1488
01:56:12,618 --> 01:56:16,380
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, we look at every week, and we sit here and look at an empty room.

1489
01:56:17,060 --> 01:56:19,941
[SPEAKER_02]: All the time, you have meetings, we have a career.

1490
01:56:20,401 --> 01:56:20,941
[SPEAKER_02]: No one's here.

1491
01:56:21,381 --> 01:56:25,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone's at home, as Council Scott probably mentioned, it's the same.

1492
01:56:26,149 --> 01:56:30,110
[SPEAKER_02]: group of people that are responding to the surveys and those other things.

1493
01:56:30,230 --> 01:56:36,292
[SPEAKER_02]: It's time we get back to meeting in City Hall or have public meetings where people meet in person.

1494
01:56:37,832 --> 01:56:43,094
[SPEAKER_02]: The Zoom is good and everything is fine, but there's no participation anymore.

1495
01:56:44,094 --> 01:56:47,515
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no face-to-face interaction with anybody.

1496
01:56:47,915 --> 01:56:52,976
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, a lot of people don't like, I personally don't like going on Zoom meetings, because there's no interaction.

1497
01:56:56,187 --> 01:57:09,958
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, this is probably one of the bad things that come out of the COVID, was everybody now lives in another world, and not everybody has access to that other world of Zoom and computers.

1498
01:57:09,978 --> 01:57:22,888
[SPEAKER_02]: So though I applaud this, I think that the governments, not just here and everywhere, needs to start getting back into the building and having public meetings where there are people who can interact with each other.

1499
01:57:22,908 --> 01:57:25,690
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Carvalho.

1500
01:57:26,683 --> 01:57:28,706
[SPEAKER_17]: Any further discussion?

1501
01:57:29,287 --> 01:57:31,231
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion of counts, oh, sorry, do you see?

1502
01:57:31,251 --> 01:57:33,234
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, no, okay, we just lost that hand.

1503
01:57:34,456 --> 01:57:37,000
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion of counts, we're saying seconded by Vice President Behrs.

1504
01:57:37,060 --> 01:57:37,661
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor?

1505
01:57:38,482 --> 01:57:39,364
[SPEAKER_17]: All those opposed?

1506
01:57:39,424 --> 01:57:40,826
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, come on, all those in favor?

1507
01:57:41,543 --> 01:57:52,470
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, all those opposed motion passes to 3-299 offer by Councilor Carviello, be it so resolved that the Medford City Council have the new facilities manager look into the ventilation blower and the all the chambers.

1508
01:57:52,970 --> 01:57:58,374
[SPEAKER_17]: The sound from the fan makes it difficult for people with hearing disabilities to hear the conversation from the council, Councilor Carviello.

1509
01:58:00,535 --> 01:58:05,697
[SPEAKER_02]: This is one of the few nights that I'm able to hear.

1510
01:58:05,717 --> 01:58:13,880
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think for those of us who sit in this side of the room here, it's literally next to impossible to hear when that blow goes up.

1511
01:58:13,900 --> 01:58:17,961
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, it didn't go out tonight because we have neither the air conditioning nor the heat on.

1512
01:58:18,781 --> 01:58:21,542
[SPEAKER_17]: But like I say, it's a bear's turn to turn the fan off.

1513
01:58:21,822 --> 01:58:22,262
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1514
01:58:27,497 --> 01:58:34,500
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a hearing disability, and I have hearing, I can't wear them in here because when that blower goes off, it just makes you go crazy.

1515
01:58:36,621 --> 01:58:39,422
[SPEAKER_02]: I assume we have a facilities manager.

1516
01:58:41,385 --> 01:58:42,847
[SPEAKER_02]: could be him for all we know.

1517
01:58:44,929 --> 01:58:48,013
[SPEAKER_02]: We have no idea who the person is or what he or she does.

1518
01:58:48,473 --> 01:58:51,256
[SPEAKER_02]: But it'd be nice if someone could look at this.

1519
01:58:51,336 --> 01:58:58,605
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the people at least in this side of the room can hear conversations with our other counselors.

1520
01:59:02,250 --> 01:59:06,613
[SPEAKER_15]: I have had a conversation with the new facilities but you better.

1521
01:59:06,633 --> 01:59:07,474
[SPEAKER_15]: I met him.

1522
01:59:07,774 --> 01:59:11,898
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, he is looking at the space the lighting curtains, etc.

1523
01:59:12,278 --> 01:59:16,222
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sure that if we put a resolution on and be happy to co sponsor with you he'd come down and talk to us.

1524
01:59:17,202 --> 01:59:19,544
[SPEAKER_15]: But he's probably gonna say is, I need money.

1525
01:59:20,085 --> 01:59:22,487
[SPEAKER_15]: And then, you know, we're back across the hall again.

1526
01:59:24,007 --> 01:59:24,387
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1527
01:59:24,848 --> 01:59:31,813
[SPEAKER_02]: I say I would like him to come down and maybe, maybe offer a solution to so people with disabilities can hear.

1528
01:59:33,254 --> 01:59:40,159
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, there's no one, there's no one in the room, but in past days, we used to have to hand out little packs for the people with hearing disabilities.

1529
01:59:40,439 --> 01:59:43,221
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know if they even exist anymore.

1530
01:59:44,242 --> 01:59:45,443
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1531
01:59:45,703 --> 01:59:49,745
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I'm understanding is that Councilor Beza has spoken with the facility manager.

1532
01:59:49,785 --> 01:59:51,906
[SPEAKER_04]: The facility manager says he has control over the room.

1533
01:59:52,146 --> 01:59:56,989
[SPEAKER_04]: We had residents in the community that had spoken with the mayor about the room, and the mayor said that the administration has nothing to do with the room.

1534
01:59:58,930 --> 02:00:00,571
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just trying to figure out what's going on.

1535
02:00:00,611 --> 02:00:02,592
[SPEAKER_04]: This place is like Circus City.

1536
02:00:02,792 --> 02:00:03,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Madam President.

1537
02:00:03,732 --> 02:00:09,315
[SPEAKER_17]: I know it's not me.

1538
02:00:09,375 --> 02:00:11,957
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Navarro, is there any further discussion from the council?

1539
02:00:13,473 --> 02:00:36,645
[SPEAKER_11]: William Navar 108 Medford Street apartment, one B. I was just going to suggest that maybe you have the resolution to look into those headsets and so on that counselor whoever yellow mentioned, there's been a few times when, you know, few people I know, usually senior citizens come here and they know I come here all the time and they say I can't hear a damn thing.

1540
02:00:37,676 --> 02:00:39,858
[SPEAKER_11]: And I say, well, there used to be over there.

1541
02:00:39,958 --> 02:00:41,539
[SPEAKER_11]: I saw people used to get these things.

1542
02:00:41,619 --> 02:00:42,659
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know where they are now.

1543
02:00:43,880 --> 02:00:44,661
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we don't know.

1544
02:00:45,101 --> 02:00:49,984
[SPEAKER_11]: So if we could just like look into that, and if they do, maybe just like, you know, have something.

1545
02:00:50,425 --> 02:00:51,545
[SPEAKER_11]: By law, they should be here.

1546
02:00:51,665 --> 02:00:52,366
[SPEAKER_11]: They should be.

1547
02:00:53,306 --> 02:01:02,032
[SPEAKER_11]: But also, there should be something letting people know about them, what the procedure is to get them, et cetera, because as of now, they aren't accessible.

1548
02:01:02,072 --> 02:01:03,213
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe we haven't found them.

1549
02:01:06,994 --> 02:01:07,574
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, thank you.

1550
02:01:08,435 --> 02:01:10,715
[SPEAKER_17]: Signs pretty small, but yeah.

1551
02:01:11,296 --> 02:01:13,556
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, the signs near the door.

1552
02:01:13,596 --> 02:01:15,797
[SPEAKER_15]: Come on, William, as Council and I would say you can't even cross.

1553
02:01:30,123 --> 02:01:39,429
[SPEAKER_11]: So I guess if we could just make that more clear to everybody, including the members of the council, how that works, so we can help different members of the community hear what's going on.

1554
02:01:39,449 --> 02:01:42,892
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I mean, if you can pass that along in the audience when people ask.

1555
02:01:44,613 --> 02:01:47,134
[SPEAKER_07]: We've been here for 18 years, I didn't realize we had a sign.

1556
02:01:51,537 --> 02:01:52,878
[SPEAKER_15]: Any further discussion?

1557
02:01:52,938 --> 02:01:55,160
[SPEAKER_15]: I was just gonna move to- We have a vote on this.

1558
02:01:55,808 --> 02:01:56,188
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, sorry.

1559
02:01:56,729 --> 02:02:07,634
[SPEAKER_15]: I was just going to move to place this under reports due deadlines and invite the facilities manager to a future meeting.

1560
02:02:07,834 --> 02:02:10,736
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion of Vice President Behrs, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

1561
02:02:10,776 --> 02:02:11,456
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor?

1562
02:02:12,117 --> 02:02:12,757
[SPEAKER_17]: All those opposed?

1563
02:02:12,797 --> 02:02:13,217
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes.

1564
02:02:13,237 --> 02:02:15,058
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry, Vice President Behrs, I thought you wanted to move around.

1565
02:02:15,138 --> 02:02:16,779
[SPEAKER_15]: Move around the agenda.

1566
02:02:16,799 --> 02:02:19,560
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's go, Celtics are losing, I'm bummed.

1567
02:02:20,761 --> 02:02:22,042
[SPEAKER_15]: It's over anyway, glad we missed it.

1568
02:02:23,117 --> 02:02:40,384
[SPEAKER_17]: 23 dash 300 offered by cancer Carvajal Oh, it's a result of the member city council have the administration look into complaints about residents and businesses putting mail for various departments into the mailboxes outside the hall, then not being delivered to the proper department sometimes causing residents to pay additional fees Council Carvajal.

1569
02:02:40,964 --> 02:02:41,905
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Madam President.

1570
02:02:43,443 --> 02:03:00,790
[SPEAKER_02]: Over the past probably two or three weeks, I've been receiving calls from residents and businesses who are saying that they're putting in their forms and applications for things, and people are paying their tax bills in those boxes outside the door.

1571
02:03:01,610 --> 02:03:10,574
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of them, they're saying that they're not getting to where they're supposed to be, and people are even having to pay late fees because of that.

1572
02:03:10,954 --> 02:03:12,395
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know who,

1573
02:03:13,815 --> 02:03:20,387
[SPEAKER_02]: who picks up the mail or is there a process on how that mail gets delivered?

1574
02:03:20,928 --> 02:03:22,010
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Clerk, maybe you would know.

1575
02:03:23,396 --> 02:03:26,698
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe each department has a key to their individual mailbox, and they check it.

1576
02:03:26,978 --> 02:03:28,559
[SPEAKER_10]: So do they go there every day and check it?

1577
02:03:29,499 --> 02:03:30,840
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know the answer to that one.

1578
02:03:31,120 --> 02:03:49,750
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if we can find out who's responsible for getting the mail, and when the resident gets a late fee, because the bill has been sitting, their checks have been sitting in the box for three days, it's not fair to them, and the people in different departments are just refusing to waive them.

1579
02:03:50,522 --> 02:03:55,906
[SPEAKER_02]: So if that's something we can look into and find out what the process says to how that meal gets delivered.

1580
02:03:56,787 --> 02:04:02,631
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for the discussion on the motion of council prevail and the clerk is going to look into it as well.

1581
02:04:03,151 --> 02:04:06,133
[SPEAKER_17]: Seconded by prices and bears all those in favor.

1582
02:04:09,957 --> 02:04:11,578
[SPEAKER_17]: 23-301 offered by Councilor Carvalho.

1583
02:04:11,618 --> 02:04:18,823
[SPEAKER_17]: Be it so resolved that the Medford City Council be provided with an update by the Building Commissioner on the progress or lack thereof at 551 Winthrop Street.

1584
02:04:19,103 --> 02:04:19,744
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Carvalho.

1585
02:04:20,084 --> 02:04:21,885
[SPEAKER_02]: Mayor President, is the Building Commissioner still on?

1586
02:04:21,945 --> 02:04:22,105
[SPEAKER_02]: He's not.

1587
02:04:22,145 --> 02:04:24,587
[SPEAKER_17]: He was on earlier, but he did not stick around.

1588
02:04:24,807 --> 02:04:26,308
[SPEAKER_17]: I forgot we have this paper, so.

1589
02:04:27,368 --> 02:04:36,094
[SPEAKER_02]: For those of us who traverse that area over by the high school, we call it the hole in the rock there,

1590
02:04:37,319 --> 02:04:42,741
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that project's been going on for eight years or longer.

1591
02:04:42,761 --> 02:04:44,301
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, it started under McGlynn.

1592
02:04:44,661 --> 02:04:47,822
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so it's been going on forever.

1593
02:04:48,202 --> 02:04:55,065
[SPEAKER_02]: But Madam President, I got calls from people this week saying, you know, blasting is still continuing.

1594
02:04:55,745 --> 02:04:57,405
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not getting any notifications.

1595
02:04:57,826 --> 02:05:02,987
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I've learned over there is that has turned into a rock quarry.

1596
02:05:03,387 --> 02:05:05,068
[SPEAKER_02]: All they're doing is selling rock out of there.

1597
02:05:06,324 --> 02:05:08,505
[SPEAKER_02]: So are they paying taxes?

1598
02:05:08,785 --> 02:05:14,948
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they're operating a rock business out of that hole in the ground for the last four, five, six, seven years.

1599
02:05:14,968 --> 02:05:17,809
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want a report from the building commission.

1600
02:05:18,050 --> 02:05:20,911
[SPEAKER_02]: How long is that building permit gonna stay open for?

1601
02:05:21,991 --> 02:05:23,292
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they don't even have a building permit.

1602
02:05:23,332 --> 02:05:26,894
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they have some kind of permit.

1603
02:05:27,354 --> 02:05:32,736
[SPEAKER_02]: Those people, they're operating a rock quarry business because all they're doing is selling rock out of there.

1604
02:05:32,976 --> 02:05:33,537
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not,

1605
02:05:34,553 --> 02:05:35,514
[SPEAKER_02]: what it was supposed to be.

1606
02:05:35,814 --> 02:05:39,799
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we can get some kind of report to the building commissioner, is that allowed for them to continue?

1607
02:05:40,059 --> 02:05:41,521
[SPEAKER_02]: And how long is that?

1608
02:05:42,402 --> 02:05:47,368
[SPEAKER_02]: Is their process going to stay open before there's actually going to be a house built there?

1609
02:05:47,588 --> 02:05:48,249
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

1610
02:05:49,029 --> 02:05:52,073
[SPEAKER_17]: I did talk with the developer when they started blasting again.

1611
02:05:53,054 --> 02:05:53,854
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I live over there.

1612
02:05:53,914 --> 02:05:54,375
[SPEAKER_17]: I felt it.

1613
02:05:55,375 --> 02:06:02,538
[SPEAKER_17]: And I was pretty livid that you know, we had had this we had established this communication pathway to get these texts when we were going to get blasting we heard a blast.

1614
02:06:03,018 --> 02:06:06,399
[SPEAKER_17]: Apparently, the reason was for that was because they're using a different blasting company now.

1615
02:06:06,459 --> 02:06:08,880
[SPEAKER_17]: So the previous blasting company was who was sending texts.

1616
02:06:09,360 --> 02:06:10,841
[SPEAKER_17]: The new company didn't know that was a thing.

1617
02:06:10,921 --> 02:06:13,242
[SPEAKER_17]: So the developer actually I asked them to the developer,

1618
02:06:13,722 --> 02:06:17,184
[SPEAKER_17]: started personally sending texts to that list again and emails to that list again.

1619
02:06:17,605 --> 02:06:22,548
[SPEAKER_17]: I was told that, I already forgot, I think Monday was the last day of their blasting.

1620
02:06:23,048 --> 02:06:26,630
[SPEAKER_17]: I know they started blasting again because they hit some more rock they didn't anticipate.

1621
02:06:26,690 --> 02:06:28,872
[SPEAKER_17]: So I don't know if that's just going to happen again.

1622
02:06:28,892 --> 02:06:33,915
[SPEAKER_17]: It's funny thing about blasting out ledge, there tends to be more ledge underneath like it's not

1623
02:06:34,855 --> 02:06:35,875
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a normal idea.

1624
02:06:35,956 --> 02:06:37,256
[SPEAKER_17]: It shouldn't be a surprise.

1625
02:06:37,476 --> 02:06:39,056
[SPEAKER_02]: The region built on ledge.

1626
02:06:39,096 --> 02:06:40,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, my house is on ledge.

1627
02:06:40,897 --> 02:06:44,138
[SPEAKER_02]: But Madam President, they're operating a rock white business over there.

1628
02:06:44,278 --> 02:06:45,338
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1629
02:06:45,698 --> 02:06:47,179
[SPEAKER_02]: That shouldn't be, is it allowed?

1630
02:06:47,779 --> 02:06:52,540
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we getting any taxes for all the rock that they've sold out of there?

1631
02:06:52,860 --> 02:06:54,881
[SPEAKER_15]: City should be getting 20% of the rocks at least.

1632
02:06:56,369 --> 02:06:58,350
[SPEAKER_02]: You need those rocks.

1633
02:06:58,390 --> 02:07:00,930
[SPEAKER_02]: If we can get a report from the building commissioner, it'd be appreciated.

1634
02:07:01,050 --> 02:07:02,030
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, no, and I appreciate that.

1635
02:07:02,090 --> 02:07:06,452
[SPEAKER_17]: And they did say, the developer said they were hoping to start actually building in June.

1636
02:07:07,052 --> 02:07:11,233
[SPEAKER_17]: But again, I did hear from Director Hunt that they don't have a, they haven't, they don't have a building permit yet.

1637
02:07:11,293 --> 02:07:13,513
[SPEAKER_17]: So there's a few different things moving.

1638
02:07:13,553 --> 02:07:19,775
[SPEAKER_17]: So on the motion of Councilor, or any further discussion, just Councilor Carvillo and I are having a discussion.

1639
02:07:20,875 --> 02:07:26,080
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion of Councilor Carviello, as amended by Councilor Carviello, seconded by Vice-President Behrs.

1640
02:07:26,120 --> 02:07:26,781
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor?

1641
02:07:26,801 --> 02:07:28,082
[SPEAKER_17]: All those opposed?

1642
02:07:28,142 --> 02:07:28,843
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes.

1643
02:07:28,863 --> 02:07:32,126
[SPEAKER_17]: 23-302 offered by Councilor Carviello.

1644
02:07:32,767 --> 02:07:41,575
[SPEAKER_17]: Be it so resolved that the Medford City Council review and discuss a moratorium for zoning and development on Mystic Ave and other identified locations until the zoning process is complete.

1645
02:07:42,036 --> 02:07:42,737
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Carviello.

1646
02:07:43,417 --> 02:07:44,278
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you again, Madam President.

1647
02:07:46,468 --> 02:07:51,651
[SPEAKER_02]: I put forward this resolution with the intent of encouraging smart growth in Medford.

1648
02:07:52,451 --> 02:08:03,858
[SPEAKER_02]: What we're seeing is community around us maximizing their zoning, allowing for the best use of their main corridors, while we in Medford

1649
02:08:05,542 --> 02:08:06,383
[SPEAKER_02]: behind everyone else.

1650
02:08:07,064 --> 02:08:14,693
[SPEAKER_02]: The council has repeatedly asked the mayor and her administration for funding to complete the zoning processes that we started.

1651
02:08:14,713 --> 02:08:16,095
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can grow and grow smarter.

1652
02:08:17,156 --> 02:08:21,080
[SPEAKER_02]: We want our businesses to provide good paying jobs and investments in our community.

1653
02:08:22,462 --> 02:08:22,863
[SPEAKER_02]: And for this

1654
02:08:24,143 --> 02:08:26,666
[SPEAKER_02]: we'll bring new revenue streams to the city that we desperately need.

1655
02:08:27,426 --> 02:08:38,418
[SPEAKER_02]: If we continue on the way we are today, we will allow Medford to remain sedentary, continuing to invite used car lots, body shops that add little or no value to our city.

1656
02:08:39,500 --> 02:08:42,102
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm getting tired of the leftovers from other communities.

1657
02:08:42,122 --> 02:08:47,627
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to see Method be considered for investments the same way Somerville, Everett, and Maldonado.

1658
02:08:48,148 --> 02:08:58,297
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Madam President, I would make a motion that we send this to the Business and Economic Development Subcommittee for further discussion.

1659
02:08:58,317 --> 02:08:59,758
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1660
02:08:59,958 --> 02:09:00,419
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Sang.

1661
02:09:04,386 --> 02:09:05,767
[SPEAKER_14]: I totally agree with the sentiment of it.

1662
02:09:05,867 --> 02:09:08,409
[SPEAKER_14]: I think smart growth is super important.

1663
02:09:09,290 --> 02:09:14,634
[SPEAKER_14]: And to make sure that we're doing our developments right is, I think, very important.

1664
02:09:16,796 --> 02:09:19,478
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, Mystic Ave, we all know, is super touchy as well.

1665
02:09:20,359 --> 02:09:27,404
[SPEAKER_14]: I happen to live close enough where, talking to my neighbors, there is a wide, wide range of opinions about what we should do there.

1666
02:09:29,126 --> 02:09:31,247
[SPEAKER_14]: My only concern is with the word moratorium.

1667
02:09:32,581 --> 02:09:37,924
[SPEAKER_14]: And just I just think it's maybe too blunt of an instrument of a word to put in.

1668
02:09:37,984 --> 02:09:42,166
[SPEAKER_14]: You said that it's less about the moratorium, more about the intent of it, which I support.

1669
02:09:42,186 --> 02:09:48,209
[SPEAKER_14]: I just wonder if you'd be amenable to... Maybe I shouldn't have put the word moratorium in there.

1670
02:09:48,389 --> 02:09:55,492
[SPEAKER_02]: But the intent is we just can't let this continue to go on and just keep taking everybody's leftovers here.

1671
02:09:55,512 --> 02:10:00,095
[SPEAKER_02]: These businesses are being chased out of other communities because

1672
02:10:02,137 --> 02:10:07,858
[SPEAKER_02]: they're buying the property and putting up smart growth and WIC and all the crap is coming in.

1673
02:10:08,178 --> 02:10:08,379
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

1674
02:10:08,519 --> 02:10:13,580
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, it really underscores the need for us to do another round of rezoning as fast as we can.

1675
02:10:13,860 --> 02:10:16,981
[SPEAKER_02]: We spent a lot of time zoning the codifying the rules.

1676
02:10:17,201 --> 02:10:20,421
[SPEAKER_02]: And we asked for the most important part was the actual zoning.

1677
02:10:21,042 --> 02:10:26,503
[SPEAKER_02]: And what are we a year and a half now we're still waiting for the funding so we can do the actual zoning.

1678
02:10:28,864 --> 02:10:43,679
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, I would just wonder if you'd be amenable to maybe instead of more I'm just I mean, I'd be happy to have a moratorium on tools for smart zoning, maybe something like that.

1679
02:10:44,500 --> 02:10:45,100
[SPEAKER_17]: That's fine.

1680
02:10:45,180 --> 02:10:49,705
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Madam President and, you know, we

1681
02:10:51,111 --> 02:10:58,966
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, I'll address the substance that I'll address the larger, the larger thing that we're working on my suggestions, just because I'm not on the subcommittee just to put it in your ear to those who are on the subcommittee.

1682
02:10:59,427 --> 02:11:00,850
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm pretty sure I'm not on the subcommittee.

1683
02:11:04,381 --> 02:11:21,999
[SPEAKER_15]: is a great way that we can maybe do this fast is look at the use table and say we're not going to allow these uses in C1 C2 and I districts anymore, like no new body shops no currently they're allowed by right right but we could we could adjust the use something we could do quickly in the zoning is just change the use table and say no.

1684
02:11:22,520 --> 02:11:25,963
[SPEAKER_15]: And then that would be an effective moratorium on the things we don't want to see.

1685
02:11:26,704 --> 02:11:46,373
[SPEAKER_15]: And then it would still allow people to go through plan development, or if they're by right uses that we do like to move forward on those so that would just be my suggestion, since I'm not just get my input in since I'm not on the subcommittee I think that would be a really easy way to quickly, instead of going through the real meat of the zoning ordinance just go to the use table say here are things that we don't want by right in these areas because we want to

1686
02:11:46,813 --> 02:11:49,656
[SPEAKER_15]: preserve these properties for potential better uses in the future.

1687
02:11:49,676 --> 02:12:09,094
[SPEAKER_15]: On the zoning, we did have I think a good discussion a couple weeks ago in April around the RFP and we had all of that going out to really start having interviews with the consulting teams that are going to apply for the RFP for zoning this summer and start kicking off the real zoning work in September.

1688
02:12:09,534 --> 02:12:15,660
[SPEAKER_15]: And the way that we wrote it is that, you know, it's not just we're going to spend two years on something and pass something at the end.

1689
02:12:16,060 --> 02:12:20,524
[SPEAKER_15]: It's that we're going to work on different issues and try to pass things as we move through the process.

1690
02:12:20,924 --> 02:12:22,726
[SPEAKER_15]: Some things may be bigger and take longer time.

1691
02:12:22,806 --> 02:12:25,128
[SPEAKER_15]: Some things may be low hanging fruit that we get at right away.

1692
02:12:25,488 --> 02:12:30,152
[SPEAKER_15]: So I am really hopeful that we will be able to engage on that quickly on the larger process.

1693
02:12:30,192 --> 02:12:31,514
[SPEAKER_15]: But I agree with the sentiment here.

1694
02:12:31,534 --> 02:12:36,278
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think there are certainly uses that are currently allowed by right that we don't need new

1695
02:12:37,250 --> 02:12:41,631
[SPEAKER_15]: new versions of on property that could eventually be used for much better things in the community.

1696
02:12:41,671 --> 02:12:43,152
[SPEAKER_15]: So I thank you for putting this forward.

1697
02:12:45,553 --> 02:12:46,953
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Council President, thank you.

1698
02:12:47,513 --> 02:13:02,238
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor and Councilor Baez, but I think that appreciate Councilor Carvajal to bring this, this motion forward, because I think that what he's seeing, because he is a councilor that's been in the forefront of smart development.

1699
02:13:02,558 --> 02:13:03,538
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that's what's key.

1700
02:13:04,099 --> 02:13:04,659
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that,

1701
02:13:06,728 --> 02:13:18,972
[SPEAKER_07]: you find developers going to Councilor Carviello and talking to him because he has an open mind and he understands that to move the city forward, we have to look at the smart development.

1702
02:13:19,072 --> 02:13:35,058
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that what scares me is you see businesses, big plans that have been put out for, I mean, we'll use CHA, the process that they were going to build at the site of Century Bank has now fallen through, I heard.

1703
02:13:35,818 --> 02:13:43,527
[SPEAKER_07]: And what that would leave us is, boy, wouldn't that be a great new car dealership added on that block?

1704
02:13:44,088 --> 02:13:46,811
[SPEAKER_07]: And by right, that's what we're allowing.

1705
02:13:46,891 --> 02:13:56,082
[SPEAKER_07]: So I understand Councillor Carviello's aggression when he talks about a moratorium, and I appreciate

1706
02:13:56,562 --> 02:14:17,257
[SPEAKER_07]: the the fear of moratorium and the open-mindedness to say, okay, let's not look at that, but also look at, let's change that word, but also look at the dire need of making sure that, like Councilor Beo said, is understanding getting that process in place and looking at our zoning as we go

1707
02:14:18,118 --> 02:14:39,838
[SPEAKER_07]: looking right away I think that's a great idea that Councilor Carviello can sit with your subcommittee and look at specific areas that we see right now are you know as well as anybody where they're ready to pounce and look at those rules and come back to a community the whole meeting that we all work together and look at those zones that we can

1708
02:14:40,499 --> 02:14:58,704
[SPEAKER_07]: we can make some changes right now because I understand what you're saying because I think the residents like Council saying said, they're a little nervous, because they haven't had opinions, the whole idea that we're excited about why it's why what we've talked about in very important meetings we talked about the zoning consultant coming in.

1709
02:14:59,304 --> 02:15:07,947
[SPEAKER_07]: The key is bringing in a team that's going to work with the community to set up meetings to get the ideas of every set every community separately, just like

1710
02:15:08,687 --> 02:15:16,728
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember working in Somerville 15 years ago, being part of the recreation department, sitting on this community meeting saying, this is what's gonna happen in Union Square.

1711
02:15:17,229 --> 02:15:21,589
[SPEAKER_07]: What's recreation gonna look like if we do this development in Union Square?

1712
02:15:22,009 --> 02:15:23,730
[SPEAKER_07]: And having the neighbor's input.

1713
02:15:23,790 --> 02:15:28,351
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm excited about this process, but I appreciate Councilor Carviello.

1714
02:15:28,371 --> 02:15:36,172
[SPEAKER_07]: This is, I think, a very important resolution for the fact that if we don't make a move soon or quickly,

1715
02:15:37,307 --> 02:15:42,352
[SPEAKER_07]: And obviously, we're not getting the support from the from the from the city and the administration.

1716
02:15:43,333 --> 02:15:48,397
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like that we can put our minds together like Council be as Council saying, and look at some avenues.

1717
02:15:49,138 --> 02:15:54,583
[SPEAKER_07]: I applaud that moving over to a subcommittee and moving this forward so we can see some action right away.

1718
02:15:55,084 --> 02:15:56,065
[SPEAKER_07]: So we don't see

1719
02:15:57,648 --> 02:16:07,642
[SPEAKER_07]: this development that can come in and stick there for the next 100 years without any movement and probably suffocate that area.

1720
02:16:08,023 --> 02:16:10,566
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it is, you listen, they tell you about the gateway of your community.

1721
02:16:11,368 --> 02:16:12,049
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a gateway.

1722
02:16:12,129 --> 02:16:13,751
[SPEAKER_07]: Mystic Gap, for instance, is a gateway.

1723
02:16:14,311 --> 02:16:16,033
[SPEAKER_07]: The Century Bank area is the gateway.

1724
02:16:16,493 --> 02:16:17,254
[SPEAKER_07]: This is where you come in.

1725
02:16:18,235 --> 02:16:24,802
[SPEAKER_07]: That could be a perfect site for mixed-use area that we can really do some great things and bring in some real revenue to the city.

1726
02:16:25,283 --> 02:16:26,684
[SPEAKER_07]: But we don't hear anything.

1727
02:16:26,724 --> 02:16:27,565
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't see anything.

1728
02:16:28,026 --> 02:16:34,773
[SPEAKER_07]: All we see is failures because I get phone calls from people that were involved in that saying, hey, just a heads up, CHA is backing out.

1729
02:16:35,830 --> 02:16:52,055
[SPEAKER_07]: So I really appreciate Councilor Capiello bringing this forward, because this is probably one of the most important people pieces that people don't realize of the growth of this community moving forward when you talk about funding mechanisms, when you talk about lack of basic needs that we have.

1730
02:16:53,167 --> 02:16:56,168
[SPEAKER_07]: this is the new revenue that can help us fund that.

1731
02:16:56,228 --> 02:16:58,129
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you, council, I appreciate that.

1732
02:16:58,690 --> 02:17:03,612
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, councilor, I'm sorry, councilor, well, councilor, I don't know what councilor is saying just because you've spoken already on it.

1733
02:17:03,732 --> 02:17:04,732
[SPEAKER_04]: Madam president, thank you very much.

1734
02:17:05,013 --> 02:17:13,416
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, as I'm reading this resolution, I'm thinking to myself that in effect, right now, we already have a moratorium on development.

1735
02:17:14,157 --> 02:17:18,459
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we look around at the cities that are neighboring communities and we see what they're doing.

1736
02:17:19,139 --> 02:17:20,320
[SPEAKER_04]: And we see them passing Metro by.

1737
02:17:22,054 --> 02:17:28,057
[SPEAKER_04]: We've seen them passing by Everett, Malden, Somerville, Cambridge, Belmont, Waltham, Revere.

1738
02:17:28,818 --> 02:17:30,518
[SPEAKER_04]: The list goes on, the list goes on.

1739
02:17:31,219 --> 02:17:32,580
[SPEAKER_04]: Medford is no longer in the driver's seat.

1740
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:35,981
[SPEAKER_04]: At one point in time, we were a community at first, and now we're a community that follows.

1741
02:17:37,402 --> 02:17:50,769
[SPEAKER_04]: So when I sit here and I think about, you know, how we can fix the process and change where we're at, it brings me back to the old saying, if you don't know what you stand for, you can't stand for anything.

1742
02:17:52,420 --> 02:17:56,804
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, we have a mayor here that runs on affordable housing.

1743
02:17:58,065 --> 02:18:04,431
[SPEAKER_04]: A mayor that says that her number one accomplishment was the inclusionary housing ordinance that I wrote.

1744
02:18:07,273 --> 02:18:10,996
[SPEAKER_04]: She runs on affordable housing, says that that's her number one success.

1745
02:18:11,457 --> 02:18:18,603
[SPEAKER_04]: Yet, when the reality is, there are three affordable housing developments in this community that she fights and takes it to litigation.

1746
02:18:20,070 --> 02:18:23,072
[SPEAKER_04]: So these are the things that I think Councilor Caviello is talking about.

1747
02:18:23,092 --> 02:18:28,096
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a frustration because it's, don't look at what I'm doing, just look at what I'm saying.

1748
02:18:29,678 --> 02:18:35,402
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we don't have a leader, we don't have a public administrator or a municipal manager in the corner office.

1749
02:18:37,384 --> 02:18:38,465
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a social media influencer.

1750
02:18:39,845 --> 02:18:41,086
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what we have to do.

1751
02:18:41,106 --> 02:18:41,646
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's be honest.

1752
02:18:41,666 --> 02:18:43,087
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's clear as day.

1753
02:18:43,107 --> 02:18:44,148
[SPEAKER_04]: That's clear as day.

1754
02:18:44,168 --> 02:18:45,268
[SPEAKER_04]: That's fact at this point.

1755
02:18:45,709 --> 02:18:46,589
[SPEAKER_04]: That's fact at this point.

1756
02:18:46,929 --> 02:18:47,730
[SPEAKER_04]: The city's falling apart.

1757
02:18:47,750 --> 02:18:48,851
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go play rock, paper, scissors.

1758
02:18:49,091 --> 02:18:49,531
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, come on.

1759
02:18:50,011 --> 02:18:51,452
[SPEAKER_04]: Enough's enough with this stuff.

1760
02:18:51,632 --> 02:18:52,113
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?

1761
02:18:52,133 --> 02:18:57,036
[SPEAKER_04]: Anytime something bad happens, there's a sign that says Maumau in front of City Hall and people are taking pictures.

1762
02:19:00,658 --> 02:19:03,320
[SPEAKER_04]: So when I talk about the direction that this community is going in,

1763
02:19:04,877 --> 02:19:07,099
[SPEAKER_04]: and I talk about what I think we need.

1764
02:19:07,679 --> 02:19:11,983
[SPEAKER_04]: The first thing we need is a municipal manager that knows what they stand for and where they stand.

1765
02:19:12,723 --> 02:19:14,124
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we need a vision for this community.

1766
02:19:14,485 --> 02:19:15,666
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't think we have one of those either.

1767
02:19:16,707 --> 02:19:26,034
[SPEAKER_04]: So we can talk about all these consultants that come in and all the call-in center and this contract and this consultant that comes in to create a vision for you because you don't have one.

1768
02:19:30,297 --> 02:19:32,759
[SPEAKER_04]: Or we can take the reins of this process.

1769
02:19:33,598 --> 02:19:39,620
[SPEAKER_04]: Because for the last 18, 16 months, two years before that, we've been ignored.

1770
02:19:40,540 --> 02:19:42,041
[SPEAKER_04]: We haven't been given the tools to succeed.

1771
02:19:43,041 --> 02:19:45,882
[SPEAKER_04]: And it shows, because the city hasn't looked worse.

1772
02:19:46,803 --> 02:19:47,923
[SPEAKER_04]: The city hasn't looked worse.

1773
02:19:48,663 --> 02:19:56,866
[SPEAKER_04]: There's never been a partnership that's been this broken in this community in over four decades.

1774
02:19:59,547 --> 02:20:01,888
[SPEAKER_04]: And it shows, because the community looks awful.

1775
02:20:02,991 --> 02:20:14,156
[SPEAKER_04]: So I thank the council for taking the initiative to put a difficult topic to discuss on the agenda, but I thank him for knowing where he stands and what he stands for, because that's what this business is all about.

1776
02:20:14,956 --> 02:20:16,277
[SPEAKER_04]: All you have is your word in this business.

1777
02:20:16,397 --> 02:20:17,817
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the only thing that follows you around.

1778
02:20:17,837 --> 02:20:19,798
[SPEAKER_04]: In politics, the only thing you have is your word.

1779
02:20:20,879 --> 02:20:23,660
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're a person that keeps it, people keep you.

1780
02:20:24,496 --> 02:20:26,598
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're a person that doesn't keep it, the people get rid of it.

1781
02:20:27,279 --> 02:20:28,279
[SPEAKER_04]: The people aren't stupid.

1782
02:20:28,500 --> 02:20:30,201
[SPEAKER_04]: The people know what's going on in this community.

1783
02:20:31,162 --> 02:20:32,523
[SPEAKER_04]: And I thank the gentleman for bringing it up.

1784
02:20:34,925 --> 02:20:39,289
[SPEAKER_14]: I just wanted to get firm language for the city clerk on amending it.

1785
02:20:40,430 --> 02:20:48,337
[SPEAKER_14]: So instead of a moratorium, I guess we should say revisions to the use table and other tools for smart growth.

1786
02:20:48,898 --> 02:20:49,338
[SPEAKER_17]: That's fine.

1787
02:21:05,308 --> 02:21:06,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, thank you.

1788
02:21:06,929 --> 02:21:09,552
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just want a couple last thing go.

1789
02:21:09,872 --> 02:21:22,983
[SPEAKER_02]: It's unfortunate, though, one of the one of the good things to me I did was hire Victor Schrader as a, as a, as a director, and unfortunately, less than a year later, he's gone.

1790
02:21:23,805 --> 02:21:26,226
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're left rudderless again.

1791
02:21:26,246 --> 02:21:28,047
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a big problem.

1792
02:21:28,467 --> 02:21:34,750
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you hear from developers, that's one of their concerns, that they started working with him, and where is he now?

1793
02:21:35,770 --> 02:21:37,311
[SPEAKER_02]: He's gone, working in another place.

1794
02:21:37,671 --> 02:21:41,933
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're spending money in courts.

1795
02:21:42,433 --> 02:21:46,455
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll take the Mill Creek project on $4,000 to $5,000.

1796
02:21:46,835 --> 02:21:50,116
[SPEAKER_02]: Three years in court when we knew we were going to lose on day one.

1797
02:21:51,841 --> 02:21:55,566
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't get any more negotiations out of them than we would have got on day one.

1798
02:21:55,947 --> 02:21:59,051
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's three years of taxes that we've lost.

1799
02:21:59,331 --> 02:22:02,736
[SPEAKER_02]: That building should have been up and built today and people living in there now.

1800
02:22:03,096 --> 02:22:05,420
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to put the project on the Felsway with Davis Group.

1801
02:22:05,820 --> 02:22:07,142
[SPEAKER_02]: Another two to three years.

1802
02:22:08,170 --> 02:22:09,791
[SPEAKER_02]: No wonder why KP Law loves it here.

1803
02:22:10,011 --> 02:22:12,933
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just running that bill and it's running and running and running.

1804
02:22:13,414 --> 02:22:16,776
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, we got an estimate of $450,000.

1805
02:22:17,797 --> 02:22:18,998
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know where that number came from.

1806
02:22:19,218 --> 02:22:20,719
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're fighting that group.

1807
02:22:21,059 --> 02:22:24,301
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, another group, negotiate what you can get.

1808
02:22:24,902 --> 02:22:26,183
[SPEAKER_02]: Housing could have been built there.

1809
02:22:26,223 --> 02:22:28,564
[SPEAKER_02]: We keep talking, but we don't have our housing.

1810
02:22:29,525 --> 02:22:33,908
[SPEAKER_02]: Even with those two projects, we're not even gonna hit our 10% affordable housing.

1811
02:22:34,228 --> 02:22:36,290
[SPEAKER_02]: Because now the one on Mystic Avenue pulled out.

1812
02:22:38,092 --> 02:22:42,815
[SPEAKER_02]: And we just lost a $243 million project on Boston Avenue that left town.

1813
02:22:43,616 --> 02:22:45,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Another $6 million in taxes.

1814
02:22:46,138 --> 02:22:48,059
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the reason we're behind the eight ball and everything.

1815
02:22:49,740 --> 02:22:51,962
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, something's got to be done.

1816
02:22:51,982 --> 02:22:57,145
[SPEAKER_02]: I know there's trying to hire a new economic development director.

1817
02:22:57,665 --> 02:23:05,711
[SPEAKER_02]: But by the time the person gets here, the ship is going to be sailed, and businesses are just going to continue to keep walking away.

1818
02:23:07,605 --> 02:23:10,626
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1819
02:23:10,646 --> 02:23:11,147
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.

1820
02:23:11,287 --> 02:23:20,651
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's important to point out also that this community needs at least, I'd say one and a quarter to one and a half percent of new growth annually just to sustain, just to sustain just to stay even.

1821
02:23:21,351 --> 02:23:25,133
[SPEAKER_04]: We need one and a quarter to one and a half percent of new growth each year, just to sustain.

1822
02:23:26,155 --> 02:23:43,798
[SPEAKER_04]: So when we talk about a project like the Boston Ab Project, it was going to bring an influx, an influx of money through taxation, through permitting, and more importantly, through the creation of jobs that pay a living wage, jobs that provide benefits for their employees, jobs that provide health insurance for their employees.

1823
02:23:45,113 --> 02:23:54,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Jobs are not a car dealership or a Dunkin' Donuts or a nail salon or a bank, which is, Medford's the capital of, I think, because, I mean, I think, what do we have, 27 Dunkin' Donuts in the city?

1824
02:23:55,637 --> 02:23:57,977
[SPEAKER_04]: There were 20, there were at least 20 Dunkin' Donuts in the city of Medford.

1825
02:23:58,318 --> 02:23:59,338
[SPEAKER_04]: That's our business model.

1826
02:24:00,058 --> 02:24:01,119
[SPEAKER_04]: That's our business model.

1827
02:24:01,399 --> 02:24:07,621
[SPEAKER_04]: But we have a property owner that comes before this council and asks us to support his project.

1828
02:24:08,821 --> 02:24:11,242
[SPEAKER_04]: He comes with representatives from the administration.

1829
02:24:12,102 --> 02:24:13,743
[SPEAKER_04]: We support the project, we give him the zoning.

1830
02:24:14,711 --> 02:24:17,954
[SPEAKER_04]: We carry him on our shoulders out of here like it's a big boom.

1831
02:24:18,735 --> 02:24:29,105
[SPEAKER_04]: He goes before the historical commission and they blow a $400 million project up over a garage that sits in the back of button train tracks that's fallen apart and decrepit.

1832
02:24:30,026 --> 02:24:38,615
[SPEAKER_04]: And their analysis, their analysis that they used was totally outside the scope of their authority in the ordinance.

1833
02:24:40,180 --> 02:24:45,521
[SPEAKER_04]: The historical commission is just one of many commissions that we have in this community, but it is out of control.

1834
02:24:47,002 --> 02:24:47,602
[SPEAKER_04]: Out of control.

1835
02:24:47,862 --> 02:24:49,562
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it is.

1836
02:24:49,642 --> 02:24:51,363
[SPEAKER_04]: It comes back to smart growth and smart development.

1837
02:24:51,663 --> 02:24:59,124
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't grow and we can't develop smartly if our boards and commissions don't share a vision with the administration.

1838
02:24:59,565 --> 02:25:04,706
[SPEAKER_04]: And if the administration doesn't know where they stand or what they stand for, there's never going to be that shared vision.

1839
02:25:05,506 --> 02:25:06,906
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's where we are right now.

1840
02:25:07,306 --> 02:25:09,747
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what happens after three and a half years of no leadership.

1841
02:25:12,070 --> 02:25:12,950
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Madam President.

1842
02:25:13,251 --> 02:25:13,571
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1843
02:25:15,031 --> 02:25:26,797
[SPEAKER_17]: So on the motion of Councilor Carviello as amended by Councilor saying, seconded by probably all those in favor to refer to subcommittee on business.

1844
02:25:29,860 --> 02:25:31,120
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, there's a cultural arts in there.

1845
02:25:31,140 --> 02:25:34,382
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, this is called, yeah, this is cultural arts and economic development.

1846
02:25:34,402 --> 02:25:34,922
[SPEAKER_17]: It'll get there.

1847
02:25:36,042 --> 02:25:39,084
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

1848
02:25:39,184 --> 02:25:39,924
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor?

1849
02:25:41,404 --> 02:25:42,345
[SPEAKER_17]: All those opposed?

1850
02:25:42,525 --> 02:25:43,305

[SPEAKER_17]: The claimant, casualty insurance, the claimant, USAA, claimant, casualty insurance company,

1861
02:26:31,450 --> 02:26:41,960
[SPEAKER_17]: Constance White seeks compensation for a claim paid to their insured for property damage suffered when a Medford firetruck struck the side of an insured vehicle full parked on Sturgeon Street in Medford, Mass.

1862
02:26:42,081 --> 02:26:46,265
[SPEAKER_17]: On or about March 8th, 2018, the necessary release has been obtained from the claimant.

1863
02:26:46,345 --> 02:26:50,769
[SPEAKER_17]: Breakdown of amount requested, medical cost zero, loss wages zero, property damage $3,450, other zero, total settlement $3,450.

1864
02:26:56,108 --> 02:26:56,528
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Knight.

1865
02:26:56,888 --> 02:27:01,029
[SPEAKER_04]: Madam President, this was a paper that was before us previously, and the administration had submitted it erroneously.

1866
02:27:01,049 --> 02:27:03,930
[SPEAKER_04]: There were a number of typographical errors that we asked for clarification.

1867
02:27:03,990 --> 02:27:05,070
[SPEAKER_04]: It's come back clarified.

1868
02:27:06,190 --> 02:27:06,370
[SPEAKER_04]: Ms.

1869
02:27:06,390 --> 02:27:07,871
[SPEAKER_04]: White's been waiting five years for her money.

1870
02:27:07,911 --> 02:27:08,911
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's time we give it to her.

1871
02:27:09,551 --> 02:27:10,271
[SPEAKER_04]: So I move approval.

1872
02:27:10,652 --> 02:27:10,832
Second.

1873
02:27:10,852 --> 02:27:13,472
[SPEAKER_17]: On a motion, do you have something?

1874
02:27:13,632 --> 02:27:18,613
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I just want to say, you know, we should probably be receiving more than one of these every quarter.

1875
02:27:19,134 --> 02:27:20,714
[SPEAKER_15]: And this is the first one we've seen in a long time.

1876
02:27:21,134 --> 02:27:22,334
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's five years old.

1877
02:27:22,474 --> 02:27:23,935
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's it.

1878
02:27:23,955 --> 02:27:24,475
[SPEAKER_15]: I just, you know,

1879
02:27:25,845 --> 02:27:28,507
[SPEAKER_15]: there should be more of these coming through and they're not coming down from the law office.

1880
02:27:28,588 --> 02:27:32,251
[SPEAKER_15]: And one of the reasons is that we don't have a law office except for Janice who's working very hard.

1881
02:27:32,651 --> 02:27:33,772
[SPEAKER_15]: So thank you so much.

1882
02:27:33,852 --> 02:27:39,017
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion of Councilor Nayes, seconded by Vice President, Councilor Carville.

[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, six in the affirmative, zero in the negative, one absent, the motion passes.

1897

[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion of Councilor Knight to adjourn, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

1900
02:28:03,053 --> 02:28:03,974
