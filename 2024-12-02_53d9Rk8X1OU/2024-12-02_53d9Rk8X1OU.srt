[SPEAKER_03]: I am honored to recognize one of the hardest working teams in our athletic department.

73
01:28:24,819 --> 01:28:35,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Our crew athletes work tirelessly on and off the water day in and day out for two seasons each year, working together to improve as a team and to reach their goals.

74
01:28:35,763 --> 01:28:39,705
[SPEAKER_03]: On regatta days, they're often boarding buses at 5 a.m.

75
01:28:39,725 --> 01:28:40,325
[SPEAKER_03]: to hit the road,

76
01:28:40,805 --> 01:28:43,167

77
01:28:43,788 --> 01:28:48,672
[SPEAKER_03]: The commitment and dedication made by each of these athletes is truly remarkable.

78
01:28:48,692 --> 01:28:54,697
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to ask Coach Starbrose to come up and to give you some more information about the highlights of their season.

79
01:29:03,324 --> 01:29:06,447
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Superintendent and council members.

80
01:29:07,187 --> 01:29:09,129
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the crew team is

81
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:11,102
[SPEAKER_00]: combines of both boys and girls.

82
01:29:12,023 --> 01:29:15,726
[SPEAKER_00]: And these kids are the hardest working kids I've seen in a long time.

83
01:29:16,928 --> 01:29:18,049
[SPEAKER_00]: They are very dedicated.

84
01:29:18,569 --> 01:29:19,370
[SPEAKER_00]: They work hard.

85
01:29:20,291 --> 01:29:24,195
[SPEAKER_00]: And we not only do sweep throwing, we also do sculling.

86
01:29:25,055 --> 01:29:34,049
[SPEAKER_00]: And we kind of concentrated a little this year more on sculling and it paid off by us achieving the team trophy at the state championships.

87
01:29:35,371 --> 01:29:38,956
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully we can get the spring one also but.

88
01:29:40,066 --> 01:29:51,418
[SPEAKER_00]: The kids are really dedicated, they're hard working, and I can't say enough for them, whether it's the boys team, the girls teams, the novice teams, they all work together, and each one pushes the other.

89
01:29:51,999 --> 01:29:56,544
[SPEAKER_00]: My last year's senior boat, we pre-graduated 10 seniors last year.

90
01:29:57,105 --> 01:30:01,429
[SPEAKER_00]: It was my second boat that was pushing them all season, which became

91
01:30:02,350 --> 01:30:07,133
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, our third boat, which was pushing them all the way, which jumped all the way to be the first boat this year.

92
01:30:07,673 --> 01:30:13,236
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have some really good years coming ahead of us with a really bunch of kids.

93
01:30:13,736 --> 01:30:17,978
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd like to introduce one of the captains to speak, James Klugisch.

94
01:30:25,142 --> 01:30:25,642
[SPEAKER_15]: Good evening.

95
01:30:26,022 --> 01:30:26,762
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm James Klugisch.

96
01:30:26,782 --> 01:30:29,984
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm a junior at Medford High, and I'm a captain of the Medford rowing team.

97
01:30:30,604 --> 01:30:31,325
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, this trophy,

98
01:30:32,469 --> 01:30:35,390
[SPEAKER_15]: It says team, you know, there's a lot of, we have all these medals.

99
01:30:35,530 --> 01:30:36,990
[SPEAKER_15]: You can see that a bunch of us are wearing.

100
01:30:37,490 --> 01:30:39,751
[SPEAKER_15]: Those are for your boat, but this is about the team.

101
01:30:40,211 --> 01:30:42,551
[SPEAKER_15]: And this team is how we got this trophy.

102
01:30:42,571 --> 01:30:46,312
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, every single person here really worked for it the entire season.

103
01:30:46,352 --> 01:30:49,473
[SPEAKER_15]: Again, we pushed ourselves, you know, just to make it happen.

104
01:30:49,993 --> 01:30:58,435
[SPEAKER_15]: And this is the first time we won it in team history, but although technically, yes, we have to bring it back next fall, I'm not planning to let this go anytime soon.

105
01:30:59,115 --> 01:31:00,676
[SPEAKER_15]: So we'll keep going.

106
01:31:00,836 --> 01:31:01,436
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much.

107
01:31:12,827 --> 01:31:17,790

[SPEAKER_06]: Congratulations again.

109
01:31:20,251 --> 01:31:23,453

[SPEAKER_20]: I'm very proud of you.

111
01:31:24,813 --> 01:31:27,094
[SPEAKER_20]: That trophy is quite heavy.

[SPEAKER_20]: So I am going to start with the girls team recognition.

113

159
01:38:32,871 --> 01:38:34,291
[SPEAKER_09]: Could coaches come as well, please?

160
01:39:56,877 --> 01:39:57,637
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Ntapa.

161
01:40:05,619 --> 01:40:10,779
[SPEAKER_18]: If I could just say really quick before everyone leaves, I have a long history with Medford rowing.

162
01:40:11,360 --> 01:40:14,300
[SPEAKER_18]: I actually was on one of the inaugural middle school sculling teams.

163
01:40:14,340 --> 01:40:24,022
[SPEAKER_18]: So I actually learned how to scull before sweeping and went through the team in my seventh grade year and eighth grade year at the Andrews and then all four years of high school.

164
01:40:25,962 --> 01:40:28,845
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't remember a time we've meddled this grand.

165
01:40:29,266 --> 01:40:38,716
[SPEAKER_18]: First of all, during the fall season, kudos to you for being able to do that in a fall season, rolling those three miles up to the start and then the three miles all the way back and still being able to pull ahead.

166
01:40:38,796 --> 01:40:40,157
[SPEAKER_18]: That's absolutely insane.

167
01:40:41,138 --> 01:40:45,243
[SPEAKER_18]: But I was super proud and super impressed just to see this from

168
01:40:45,703 --> 01:40:49,424
[SPEAKER_18]: you know, my time as a rower, my time as a coxswain at this height, which was crazy.

169
01:40:50,024 --> 01:40:52,985
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, but then also my time as a coach during the pandemic.

170
01:40:53,065 --> 01:40:57,587
[SPEAKER_18]: And then now like my favorite time of the year is getting to come and dock Marshall, the mayor's cup.

171
01:40:57,907 --> 01:41:04,069
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, and I just, just absolutely so proud of you all just keep doing what you're doing and just see this.

172
01:41:04,209 --> 01:41:04,969
[SPEAKER_18]: I didn't even think about it.

173
01:41:04,989 --> 01:41:08,130
[SPEAKER_18]: So I was sitting here, this grand of an achievement in the fall season,

174
01:41:08,650 --> 01:41:10,290
[SPEAKER_18]: just keep doing what you're doing.

175
01:41:10,330 --> 01:41:15,552
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm so happy to see the team still going strong, even through the pandemic, now that we're, you know, where we are now.

176
01:41:15,712 --> 01:41:18,853
[SPEAKER_18]: So just congratulations and keep doing what you're doing.

177
01:41:19,153 --> 01:41:19,493
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

178
01:41:28,455 --> 01:41:29,175
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Olopade.

179
01:41:32,705 --> 01:41:33,285
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, here we go.

180
01:41:33,445 --> 01:41:34,245
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you so much.

181
01:41:34,825 --> 01:41:43,467
[SPEAKER_12]: I also want to say as a former member of the Bedford rowing team, you know, I also was a middle school rower when I learned and I went through high school, I was elected captain my senior year.

182
01:41:43,487 --> 01:41:53,209
[SPEAKER_12]: And for me, it was not only a piece of experience of leadership, but also to be a testament to what this team does and the impact of a true team effort.

183
01:41:53,849 --> 01:41:55,429
[SPEAKER_12]: I was able to continue on in college.

184
01:41:55,449 --> 01:41:58,150
[SPEAKER_12]: And even now I still row now for boat club here in Boston.

185
01:41:58,530 --> 01:42:03,575
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm here to tell you that this type of program, not only as a team, but as individuals, you learn so much.

186
01:42:03,916 --> 01:42:06,478
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm so proud of all of you to be able to do this work and to continue on.

187
01:42:07,139 --> 01:42:08,861
[SPEAKER_12]: I think the dream of what it means to be a rower.

188
01:42:08,901 --> 01:42:10,082
[SPEAKER_12]: So congratulations to all of you.

189
01:42:22,219 --> 01:42:29,761
[SPEAKER_06]: make sure you stay in shape this winter, even through the holidays, we have the mayor's cup regatta in the, in the spring and you're going to bring it.

190
01:42:29,841 --> 01:42:30,161
[SPEAKER_06]: I know it.

191
01:42:30,361 --> 01:42:31,761
[SPEAKER_06]: So congratulations again.

192
01:42:31,781 --> 01:42:32,561
[SPEAKER_06]: Great job coach.

193
01:42:32,581 --> 01:42:43,364
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a motion to revert back to the regular order?

194
01:42:45,103 --> 01:42:48,004
[SPEAKER_06]: by Member Reinfeldt, seconded by Member Graham.

195
01:42:48,064 --> 01:42:48,744
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

196
01:42:48,764 --> 01:42:50,104
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

197
01:42:50,984 --> 01:43:02,206
[SPEAKER_06]: We have number four, consent agenda, approval of bills and payrolls, approval of capital purchases, approval of grants, approval of field trips, and approval of regular meeting minutes from November 18th, 2024.

198
01:43:02,687 --> 01:43:10,248
[SPEAKER_06]: By Member Reinfeldt, seconded by Member Olopade.

199
01:43:10,288 --> 01:43:11,148
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

200
01:43:11,888 --> 01:43:12,749
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

201
01:43:12,909 --> 01:43:14,569
[SPEAKER_06]: Consent agenda is approved.

202
01:43:16,010 --> 01:43:21,939
[SPEAKER_06]: Report of subcommittees, we have approval of the diversity, equity, and inclusion DEI subcommittee meeting minutes from November 19th, 2024.

203
01:43:21,999 --> 01:43:22,500
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Opare.

204
01:43:29,963 --> 01:43:30,363
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

205
01:43:30,463 --> 01:43:36,648
[SPEAKER_12]: So as the chair of the subcommittee I just like to briefly discuss what we talked about in our meeting before we approve the minutes.

206
01:43:37,369 --> 01:43:48,457
[SPEAKER_12]: So, it was very productive meeting we were able to have our di director, Francis and why Jay come in and work with us in opera and explain to us what she's been doing to support the school district.

207
01:43:49,137 --> 01:43:53,400
[SPEAKER_12]: We were asked some questions of her and her experience and understanding about what that looks like day to day.

208
01:43:53,420 --> 01:44:01,245
[SPEAKER_12]: We had a couple insightful pieces that it's a little difficult as the director to determine how often she's being asked to support the school district.

209
01:44:01,525 --> 01:44:03,286
[SPEAKER_12]: It's case by case it's situational.

210
01:44:03,606 --> 01:44:12,092
[SPEAKER_12]: She did explain to us and declare that she is not being given any sensitive information about any one student she does not have the legal capacity to do that but

211
01:44:12,532 --> 01:44:19,917
[SPEAKER_12]: In most cases, when she is consulted with she's given basic information to be able to give her recommendations or suggestions which we appreciated.

212
01:44:20,997 --> 01:44:30,984
[SPEAKER_12]: Ultimately, we, I think as the as the subcommittee determined that we felt it would be best to continue having her support as needed, but also consider having a new

213
01:44:31,904 --> 01:44:38,848
[SPEAKER_12]: position created and personnel come in and act as a director of DEI for the school district separately from her additional consulting.

214
01:44:39,288 --> 01:44:44,551
[SPEAKER_12]: But we would still have her come in and receive that stipend for her services to the district.

215
01:44:45,751 --> 01:44:47,592
[SPEAKER_12]: So that was kind of how that subcommittee went.

216
01:44:47,672 --> 01:44:53,996
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it was very productive and she seemed very elated to be there and to support us in the district in any way she can.

217
01:44:54,016 --> 01:44:56,577
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just wanna say thank you to the director.

218
01:44:56,917 --> 01:45:00,059
[SPEAKER_12]: And if there's any questions I'm happy to answer before we decide to continue on with the meeting.

219
01:45:07,717 --> 01:45:12,039
[SPEAKER_06]: Strategic and Capital Planning Subcommittee meeting 11-26-2024 update.

220
01:45:12,059 --> 01:45:13,780
[SPEAKER_06]: Approve the minutes first.

221
01:45:14,541 --> 01:45:17,362
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion for approval of the minutes.

222
01:45:27,528 --> 01:45:28,789
[SPEAKER_07]: These are reports of subcommittees.

223
01:45:37,432 --> 01:45:38,453
[SPEAKER_06]: through the chair, one at a time.

224
01:45:38,473 --> 01:45:38,813
[SPEAKER_06]: What do we got?

225
01:45:38,833 --> 01:45:39,774
[SPEAKER_06]: Amber Olopade.

226
01:45:39,874 --> 01:46:04,632
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, so I think what Michael is saying is that we have to determine if we're going to approve the recommendation that the subcommittee came to, which is to, we're recommending that we create a new position as a DEI lead for the school district while also maintaining the current stipend recommendation we had from the previous meeting from the DEI director for the city.

227
01:46:06,249 --> 01:46:07,610
[SPEAKER_12]: was the recommendation that we came to.

228
01:46:08,590 --> 01:46:10,371
[SPEAKER_06]: May I, through the chair, ask a question on that?

229
01:46:10,491 --> 01:46:20,997
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that something that we can approve as part of the meeting minutes, but talk further on during budget talks or supplemental budget talks?

230
01:46:21,017 --> 01:46:23,598
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I know there's going to be a lot of competing interests.

231
01:46:25,800 --> 01:46:27,400
[SPEAKER_14]: Member Rousseau?

232
01:46:28,221 --> 01:46:35,365
[SPEAKER_14]: We did discuss in the subcommittee meeting about the timing of this, and we did feel that we should not be waiting until budget season to

233
01:46:36,286 --> 01:46:37,427
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm hired for this role.

234
01:46:37,487 --> 01:46:48,015
[SPEAKER_14]: This role has a lot of responsibilities that, frankly, it sounds like the district hasn't had a person dedicated to do for, well, ever.

235
01:46:48,035 --> 01:47:03,228
[SPEAKER_14]: And it doesn't sound, when we heard the list of responsibilities, we were kind of, I mean, I can't speak for the whole subcommittee, although I will anyways, because it felt very much like we were all kind of like, that's a lot, a lot of a lot.

236
01:47:05,075 --> 01:47:10,320
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't remember the exact number, was it 11 or 19 people in Somerville public school?

237
01:47:10,340 --> 01:47:13,624
[SPEAKER_14]: 11 in Somerville public schools to just do this work?

238
01:47:14,946 --> 01:47:18,630
[SPEAKER_14]: They're a little bigger than us, like 2,000 extra kids.

239
01:47:19,851 --> 01:47:21,192
[SPEAKER_14]: Or maybe they're a lot bigger, I don't know.

240
01:47:24,139 --> 01:47:26,600
[SPEAKER_14]: So having nobody seemed untenable.

241
01:47:26,941 --> 01:47:39,788
[SPEAKER_14]: So that was why the committee recommended we get this position, get an actual job description drafted and posted after we've reviewed and approved it as soon as possible.

242
01:47:42,650 --> 01:47:45,271
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's what we discussed in the meeting.

243
01:47:48,493 --> 01:47:53,256
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm not really a fan of just waiting another six months or nine months

244
01:47:54,181 --> 01:47:55,682
[SPEAKER_14]: to post this position.

245
01:47:56,883 --> 01:47:58,924
[SPEAKER_14]: We may not get candidates right away.

246
01:47:58,984 --> 01:48:03,247
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, this isn't the best time to be hiring at all in the school districts.

247
01:48:03,787 --> 01:48:06,949
[SPEAKER_14]: So it may take a good amount of time to actually hire somebody anyways.

248
01:48:07,549 --> 01:48:22,518
[SPEAKER_14]: But if we wait till we're doing our budget, even though we have an earlier budget this year than we have done in the past, we've often been kind of behind the hiring curve in this district and going to hire, putting a,

249
01:48:24,127 --> 01:48:26,088
[SPEAKER_14]: posting out for June 1st even.

250
01:48:26,449 --> 01:48:29,951
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like all the districts that want to do this have already done all their hiring.

251
01:48:30,692 --> 01:48:32,753
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm concerned about waiting.

252
01:48:34,895 --> 01:48:41,220
[SPEAKER_06]: If I may, we have the over, after the override pass, we have the supplemental budget as well.

253
01:48:41,240 --> 01:48:45,663
[SPEAKER_06]: I just think it makes sense to talk about this as in a big picture.

254
01:48:46,984 --> 01:48:49,706
[SPEAKER_06]: We have somebody who's doing the job now.

255
01:48:49,806 --> 01:48:52,348
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not a full-time, it's not a full-time job.

256
01:48:53,806 --> 01:49:00,487
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just want to make sure we're spending that additional money in all the right ways.

257
01:49:00,527 --> 01:49:01,748
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not saying this is the wrong way.

258
01:49:01,768 --> 01:49:06,409
[SPEAKER_06]: I just think we need to take a full picture of what that $3 million looks like.

259
01:49:07,749 --> 01:49:09,649
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Russo?

260
01:49:11,230 --> 01:49:11,890
[SPEAKER_14]: I certainly agree.

261
01:49:11,910 --> 01:49:15,071
[SPEAKER_14]: We need to be very, very deliberate about how we spend our money.

262
01:49:15,131 --> 01:49:16,871
[SPEAKER_14]: I will say, though, that based on that meeting,

263
01:49:17,532 --> 01:49:23,976
[SPEAKER_14]: Even though Director Nwaje is doing an enormous amount of work, she definitely is not doing some work we need to happen.

264
01:49:24,937 --> 01:49:30,821
[SPEAKER_14]: She's not in classrooms, she's not doing stuff with students with the ability to discipline.

265
01:49:31,441 --> 01:49:36,725
[SPEAKER_14]: These are all very important things that this committee for years has been working on that

266
01:49:38,854 --> 01:49:46,860
[SPEAKER_14]: to date still does not have anybody dedicated to that work, and she can't do that work, frankly, because she's not an employee of Medford Public Schools.

267
01:49:47,541 --> 01:50:06,476
[SPEAKER_14]: So I understand your point, and I think that part of the supplemental budget is a good time to discuss this, but I think getting the drafting of a job description, that's gonna take some serious work by somebody in the administration, and I think we should have that drafted and ready to approve

268
01:50:06,994 --> 01:50:10,976
[SPEAKER_14]: whether we're funding it for this year or not, I think is part of the supplemental.

269
01:50:11,996 --> 01:50:13,257
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that could be a different vote then.

270
01:50:13,297 --> 01:50:23,101
[SPEAKER_06]: We vote to approve drafting a job description and then it come before the committee for review and additional approvals would be my suggestion.

271
01:50:25,002 --> 01:50:25,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Reinfeld?

272
01:50:29,004 --> 01:50:32,866
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I read the motion here is to create a job description.

273
01:50:34,702 --> 01:50:45,856
[SPEAKER_02]: for somebody who will work in collaboration with the city and propose the stipend for Director Nwaje to continue the work through the fiscal year in a consulting stipend basis.

274
01:50:46,117 --> 01:50:47,358
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is how I'm reading this.

275
01:50:47,559 --> 01:50:48,139
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how you read it.

276
01:50:48,159 --> 01:50:50,062
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was said that

277
01:50:50,782 --> 01:50:52,584
[SPEAKER_06]: draft the job description and post.

278
01:50:52,764 --> 01:50:56,947
[SPEAKER_06]: So as long as we get, it will come back to us for review and final decision.

279
01:50:56,967 --> 01:51:02,030
[SPEAKER_06]: I would think the supplemental budget will be discussed very soon.

280
01:51:02,050 --> 01:51:09,975
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to see the big picture of the needs and if the needs costs 10 million, we still need to stay within budget.

281
01:51:11,116 --> 01:51:13,978
[SPEAKER_06]: So, member Russo.

282
01:51:16,593 --> 01:51:18,294
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not going to read it.

283
01:51:18,314 --> 01:51:19,355
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, because, um.

284
01:51:19,375 --> 01:51:20,695
[SPEAKER_14]: It actually doesn't think about posting.

285
01:51:20,715 --> 01:51:27,399
[SPEAKER_14]: It says that we will create a new that I won't read the whole long the D I subcommittee recommends that we create a new job description.

286
01:51:27,979 --> 01:51:33,002
[SPEAKER_14]: For a school based the director who will work in collaboration with the city D I director further the.

287
01:51:34,323 --> 01:51:39,025
[SPEAKER_14]: MPs will provide an annual stipend to the D I director to compensate for the

288
01:51:46,385 --> 01:51:49,689
[SPEAKER_14]: by the December 16th meeting, which I think will come at that meeting.

289
01:51:50,109 --> 01:51:52,131
[SPEAKER_14]: So this definitely is not an expense.

290
01:51:52,572 --> 01:52:06,688
[SPEAKER_14]: We're not demanding the hiring of this person, but we have a long history and a member, Vice Chair Graham, motioned, I think, two or three years ago now to have all the job descriptions actually created and

291
01:52:07,677 --> 01:52:13,861
[SPEAKER_14]: which we are, by law, supposed to actually approve all job descriptions for people that work for Metro Public Schools.

292
01:52:14,521 --> 01:52:17,723
[SPEAKER_14]: And we all know that there are plenty of people who do not have those things.

293
01:52:19,084 --> 01:52:20,965
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think we haven't hired this person yet.

294
01:52:21,105 --> 01:52:24,487
[SPEAKER_14]: We should definitely do this before we decide to hire it.

295
01:52:25,088 --> 01:52:31,312
[SPEAKER_14]: Whether we do or not, though, in the budget that we're gonna have to discuss, we need this role.

296
01:52:32,192 --> 01:52:34,954
[SPEAKER_14]: Whether we decide we're gonna fund it now or not, I think is a different

297
01:52:35,247 --> 01:52:42,309
[SPEAKER_14]: Because that's a priorities conversation, but the role needs to exist so we can make that decision.

298
01:52:42,329 --> 01:52:46,650
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I don't think we have a, without a job description, I don't even know exactly what this person is doing.

299
01:52:47,070 --> 01:52:50,431
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that that's part of the job description creation, so.

300
01:52:56,032 --> 01:52:56,732
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Graham.

301
01:52:58,394 --> 01:52:59,535
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, two things.

302
01:52:59,956 --> 01:53:04,280
[SPEAKER_11]: One is I just want to point out that the only thing that's posted on the agenda is the approval of the minutes.

303
01:53:04,880 --> 01:53:18,372
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think we could approve the minutes and put that resolution on for discussion next week, which I think would be fine and maybe the dates need to would need to be adjusted on the floor, but I think we could totally do that.

304
01:53:19,173 --> 01:53:42,989
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, the second is, um, I haven't had a chance to watch the subcommittee meeting, but I would like to, because I, when I looked at that initial list of things, my, my immediate reaction was that it was not appropriate for the district to be terping some of those things to the director at the city, that those are capacities we should have as a district in our current central administration.

305
01:53:43,009 --> 01:53:48,353
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, and then there's like this other part of what it takes to.

306
01:53:49,213 --> 01:53:56,295
[SPEAKER_11]: do this work with like integrity and fidelity that does require dedicated people.

307
01:53:56,335 --> 01:54:07,539
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would be really interested to see that job description, but I would be fine if we just sort of pushed all of that discussion to next week so that it can be properly posted in case anybody does want to come and talk about it.

308
01:54:08,459 --> 01:54:23,472
[SPEAKER_11]: I think Director Nwaje is great, but I also think like taking a slice of somebody's already full job, like there's hundreds of employees in the city and they probably could all benefit from the work she does in a dedicated fashion without having to be sort of side supporting us.

309
01:54:23,673 --> 01:54:28,997
[SPEAKER_11]: And I would like for us to have that conversation because I think there's all kinds of things that

310
01:54:29,878 --> 01:54:52,595
[SPEAKER_11]: we should be doing and we aren't and it's it's not about like you know a non-interest in collaboration because I think the only way this works is if you put somebody in the role in a dedicated fashion inside of the organization and then they work with the director at the city because cross-collaboration in this space everything's always changing

311
01:54:53,195 --> 01:54:54,156
[SPEAKER_11]: it's really important.

312
01:54:55,257 --> 01:54:58,460
[SPEAKER_11]: But how it gets like actually implemented and executed can be quite different.

313
01:54:58,540 --> 01:55:04,025
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm totally on board with having that discussion at some point in time.

314
01:55:04,045 --> 01:55:08,429
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think we could have that discussion in part next week or in two weeks.

315
01:55:08,949 --> 01:55:12,793
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we can have it again from a funding perspective in January.

316
01:55:12,833 --> 01:55:17,177
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think for me, that's a fine timeline and it reflects sort of the urgency

317
01:55:18,037 --> 01:55:22,039
[SPEAKER_11]: Um but I don't think we have to necessarily decide that tonight.

318
01:55:22,139 --> 01:55:29,222
[SPEAKER_11]: We could just we could just approve the minutes and put that on for next week for like a fuller discussion.

319
01:55:31,844 --> 01:55:32,684
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion for approval.

320
01:55:33,284 --> 01:55:34,345
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a motion for approval?

321
01:55:34,725 --> 01:55:35,885
[SPEAKER_11]: Um motion to approve the minutes.

322
01:55:36,786 --> 01:55:38,166
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm member Graham seconded by.

323

[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed.

01:55:42,669 --> 01:55:43,309

331
01:55:55,555 --> 01:56:06,798
[SPEAKER_11]: We have held two meetings to put together a recommendation that'll come before this, this committee in a couple of weeks at our special meeting that'll be held on December 11th.

332
01:56:07,898 --> 01:56:24,471
[SPEAKER_11]: Um so I don't think we need to go into a lot of details here but thanks to the committee, thanks to some of the folks from the city who joined us to weigh in on particularly the HVAC project at McGlynn and Andrews as well as the conversations that I've been able to have with the OPM and others that are involved in that project.

333
01:56:25,651 --> 01:56:35,896
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a whole meeting dedicated to this coming up next week that we will use to sort of finalize this and then that will feed into the ongoing budget discussion from there.

334
01:56:36,076 --> 01:56:38,497
[SPEAKER_11]: So just make a motion to approve the minutes.

335
01:56:39,897 --> 01:56:42,958
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion for approval of the minutes by Member Graham, seconded by Member Reinfeldt.

336

[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

342
01:56:54,672 --> 01:56:55,252
[SPEAKER_06]: Pass it over to you.

343
01:56:56,433 --> 01:56:56,853
Thank you.

344
01:56:57,473 --> 01:56:58,413
[SPEAKER_20]: Good evening, everyone.

345
01:56:59,234 --> 01:57:03,055
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you for joining us tonight for this school committee meeting.

346
01:57:03,515 --> 01:57:12,038
[SPEAKER_20]: I hope everyone enjoyed their wonderful Thanksgiving last week and that you were able to celebrate the holiday surrounded by family and friends.

347
01:57:13,298 --> 01:57:21,361
[SPEAKER_20]: I want to start off this evening by saying how thankful I am for the great generosity from Mustang nation this Thanksgiving season.

348
01:57:22,041 --> 01:57:28,964
[SPEAKER_20]: There were so many fundraisers and food drives held by all of our schools, all of which went to help those in need.

349
01:57:30,675 --> 01:57:35,899
[SPEAKER_20]: last Tuesday truly showcased just how special our school community is.

350
01:57:36,800 --> 01:57:45,587
[SPEAKER_20]: Middle school students and staff spent their afternoon following dismissal creating over 100 Thanksgiving baskets for those in need.

351
01:57:46,448 --> 01:57:55,336
[SPEAKER_20]: The Andrews Cafeteria was filled with not only lots of items set to be donated, but seemingly just as many volunteers.

352
01:57:56,713 --> 01:58:07,015
[SPEAKER_20]: Earlier in the day, our McGlynn Elementary School community donated all their food items raised as part of their 12th annual Thanksgiving food drive.

353
01:58:07,855 --> 01:58:18,578
[SPEAKER_20]: Students helped hand off non-perishable and monetary donation items to the Medford Family Network, who came to the school to thank our students and collect the items.

354
01:58:19,398 --> 01:58:24,439
[SPEAKER_20]: Photos from both events can be found on our district's Facebook page.

355
01:58:25,888 --> 01:58:33,302
[SPEAKER_20]: Once again, thank you to all our families, caregivers, students, and staff for your kindness this Thanksgiving season.

356
01:58:33,863 --> 01:58:37,550
[SPEAKER_20]: Your dedication has truly made our community a better place.

357
01:58:40,208 --> 01:58:50,357
[SPEAKER_20]: Medford Public Schools also enjoyed Turkey Day the best way possible, with a football victory over the Malden Tornadoes.

358
01:58:51,218 --> 01:59:06,252
[SPEAKER_20]: In the 137th edition of the longest continuous rivalry in the country, our Mustangs came out on top 34 to 14 under some very wet, wet conditions.

359
01:59:06,912 --> 01:59:11,533
[SPEAKER_20]: Our cheerleaders finished off a great fall season supporting the players and coaches.

360
01:59:12,494 --> 01:59:17,935
[SPEAKER_20]: While our band didn't play due to the weather, their tremendous spirit was not forgotten.

361
01:59:18,916 --> 01:59:28,858
[SPEAKER_20]: I'd like to extend a special thank you to Member Brandley, Member Ntapa, and Member Olopade who braved the weather and supported the Mustangs.

362
01:59:29,559 --> 01:59:33,400
[SPEAKER_20]: I also would like to recognize members of our city council.

363
01:59:34,600 --> 01:59:42,746
[SPEAKER_20]: Councilor saying, Councilor Lazaro and Councilor Callahan for coming out to support the Mustangs on Thanksgiving Day.

364
01:59:43,446 --> 01:59:54,693
[SPEAKER_20]: And last but not least, I'd like to thank State Representative Donato who was there, braving the weather and supporting both teams, but of course the Mustangs came out on top.

365
01:59:56,114 --> 01:59:56,835
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you for that.

366
01:59:57,375 --> 02:00:03,679
[SPEAKER_20]: So this 20 point win capped off a historical season for the varsity football team.

367
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:16,305
[SPEAKER_20]: As a result, the Medford Mustangs clinched the Greater Boston League Championship for only the sixth time ever.

368
02:00:17,466 --> 02:00:19,687
[SPEAKER_20]: And this was the first time since 1985.

369
02:00:22,928 --> 02:00:26,149
[SPEAKER_20]: the Medford Mustangs are GBL champions.

370
02:00:27,109 --> 02:00:43,513
[SPEAKER_20]: Additionally, it's the first time our football team achieved back-to-back winning seasons since 1991, and the first time we've defeated Malden two years in a row since 2001.

371
02:00:46,275 --> 02:00:55,085
[SPEAKER_20]: Congratulations to all our players, our families, Coach Curley and his staff, and to all our supporters on a fantastic season.

372
02:00:56,710 --> 02:01:05,072
[SPEAKER_20]: With Thanksgiving falling so late on the calendar this year, we all have even less time than usual to prepare for the busy holiday season.

373
02:01:06,312 --> 02:01:14,774
[SPEAKER_20]: Our band got an early start to the festivities with the opening day of their annual Christmas tree and holiday wreath sale last Saturday.

374
02:01:14,794 --> 02:01:21,455
[SPEAKER_20]: I just want you to know this year I got my tree, last year they sold out early.

375
02:01:22,055 --> 02:01:30,563
[SPEAKER_20]: So all I can encourage everyone is come out this weekend, support our band, they're there from 10am to 4pm.

376
02:01:31,304 --> 02:01:36,449

[SPEAKER_20]: ranging from $85, $95, and $105, and the wreaths are between $15 and $20, ornaments for $5.

378
02:01:46,213 --> 02:01:47,274
[SPEAKER_20]: It's very reasonable.

379
02:01:47,294 --> 02:01:54,357
[SPEAKER_20]: I went shopping this weekend for Black Friday, and I can tell you the stores are way more expensive than our own

02:01:55,438 --> 02:01:58,943
[SPEAKER_20]: marching band fundraiser so please come out and support them this weekend.

381

02:02:11,360 --> 02:02:19,888
[SPEAKER_20]: Our award winning high school in middle school band will be joining our beautiful orchestra later this month at their annual winter concert.

388
02:02:50,894 --> 02:02:58,822
[SPEAKER_20]: Lastly, I'm really excited to share that kindergarten registration for next school year will begin on Thursday, January 2.

389
02:02:59,803 --> 02:03:07,891
[SPEAKER_20]: This is the earliest we have ever opened registration, as we eagerly anticipate welcoming future students to Mustang Nation.

390
02:03:08,591 --> 02:03:17,537
[SPEAKER_20]: In collaboration with the city information about the kindergarten registration process will be shared in the mail, and within the community, very soon.

02:05:00,208 --> 02:05:03,710
[SPEAKER_09]: Dr. Cushing.

410
02:05:06,613 --> 02:05:06,793
[SPEAKER_17]: Hello.

411
02:05:07,580 --> 02:05:09,121
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry, new system.

412
02:05:09,141 --> 02:05:11,342
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, good evening, Madam Mayor, members of the committee.

413
02:05:11,382 --> 02:05:31,513
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you very much for letting us take this opportunity to formally let you know about the in-control driver training that the Medford Public Schools has been able to do because of a very good partnership with the Medford Police Department, Sergeant Jordan Canava, who has authored the grants over the last several years.

414
02:05:31,933 --> 02:05:36,776
[SPEAKER_17]: This all started about four years ago when a community member and Mr. Strollo

415
02:05:37,656 --> 02:05:49,663
[SPEAKER_17]: came to us to really look at bringing in, you know, parts of the curriculum to really have students understand texting and driving safe driving and those impacts.

416
02:05:50,263 --> 02:05:57,407
[SPEAKER_17]: Last year, previously we had done some demonstrations at the high school for students where they rode along.

417
02:05:57,947 --> 02:06:11,783
[SPEAKER_17]: And last year we were able to start bringing students down to South Weymouth Naval Air Station or the former South Weymouth Naval Air Station for students who had the permits to be able to practice maneuvers on the course.

418
02:06:12,964 --> 02:06:14,985
[SPEAKER_17]: within control has been simply phenomenal.

419
02:06:16,245 --> 02:06:21,927
[SPEAKER_17]: And we're able to bring down groups of up to 15 students, 13 to 15 students per visit.

420
02:06:22,947 --> 02:06:27,208
[SPEAKER_17]: And I will let Dan talk about that because that's his area of expertise.

421
02:06:27,608 --> 02:06:30,629
[SPEAKER_17]: But this has been really a phenomenal opportunity for our students.

422
02:06:31,370 --> 02:06:37,672
[SPEAKER_17]: And we would also love to invite any of you to come down and participate in the course as well.

423
02:06:38,152 --> 02:06:39,012
[SPEAKER_17]: But Dan Strohlow.

424
02:06:40,438 --> 02:06:40,778
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

425
02:06:41,178 --> 02:06:44,520
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm impressed I've never been anywhere where my name has been pronounced right three times in a row.

426
02:06:45,201 --> 02:06:55,967
[SPEAKER_16]: And I also want to go on record as saying I was very impressed with the rowers I know they left the building as a former motor boat operator, just the idea of motoring six miles for one trip is exhausting but

427
02:06:56,647 --> 02:06:57,148
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not sure.

428
02:06:59,329 --> 02:07:03,012
[SPEAKER_16]: First, I'm the executive director of a nonprofit called the In Control Family Foundation.

429
02:07:03,112 --> 02:07:06,295
[SPEAKER_16]: We've been working in Medford in partnership with Safe Roads Alliance.

430
02:07:06,395 --> 02:07:09,818
[SPEAKER_16]: They're doing the Kids Speaking Up for Road Safety program in the elementary schools.

431
02:07:10,438 --> 02:07:18,725
[SPEAKER_16]: And we're doing the hands-on program, both community visits where we come to the Medford High School and allow students to ride along with us and learn the importance of seatbelts.

432
02:07:19,365 --> 02:07:22,448
[SPEAKER_16]: Massachusetts is second to last place for seatbelt use in the country.

433
02:07:23,462 --> 02:07:23,742
[SPEAKER_16]: We are.

434
02:07:25,303 --> 02:07:33,588
[SPEAKER_16]: We importance of staying at or below the speed limit and how much of an impact even just a few miles an hour over the speed limit has on your ability to stay in control of the car.

435
02:07:34,249 --> 02:07:40,853
[SPEAKER_16]: And then discouraging impairments, drinking, drugs, drowsiness, and distractions, all big problems more recently.

436
02:07:42,634 --> 02:07:48,498
[SPEAKER_16]: If you haven't been paying attention, we are losing a lot more people on our roadways today than we were just five or six years ago.

437
02:07:49,127 --> 02:07:54,092
[SPEAKER_16]: The peak everybody hoped was during the pandemic, and then it's continued to get worse every year since.

438
02:07:54,892 --> 02:08:01,799
[SPEAKER_16]: One point I always like to make sure everybody recognizes is that the United States used to be the safest place in the world to drive a car.

439
02:08:02,499 --> 02:08:03,821
[SPEAKER_16]: Can anybody guess where we are today?

440
02:08:03,841 --> 02:08:08,985
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, we're generally around 40th place.

441
02:08:09,986 --> 02:08:11,588
[SPEAKER_16]: We focus on technology.

442
02:08:12,372 --> 02:08:13,993
[SPEAKER_16]: And technology is amazing.

443
02:08:14,033 --> 02:08:18,256
[SPEAKER_16]: It can do some impressive stuff, but if we don't train people how to use it, we lose lives.

444
02:08:18,877 --> 02:08:28,063
[SPEAKER_16]: And the other big thing that I think with a role that you folks have, the death rate in car crashes used to be a biggest issue between the ages of 15 and 18.

445
02:08:28,263 --> 02:08:30,605
[SPEAKER_16]: Today, it's between 19 and 25.

446
02:08:31,145 --> 02:08:40,752
[SPEAKER_16]: If you look at the number of kids we lose between the ages of 15 and 25 today versus 10, 15 years ago, it's collectively through the roof.

447
02:08:41,638 --> 02:08:51,042
[SPEAKER_16]: But we lose a lot more kids when they're out in the community and no longer part of the high school, when they're working, when they're maybe at college, something like that.

448
02:08:51,483 --> 02:08:52,583
[SPEAKER_16]: And so it's not the same.

449
02:08:52,803 --> 02:08:53,704
[SPEAKER_16]: We don't find out about it.

450
02:08:53,724 --> 02:08:55,825
[SPEAKER_16]: We don't mourn them the same way we used to.

451
02:08:56,405 --> 02:08:59,006
[SPEAKER_16]: And so these lives are getting lost, and we just don't talk about it.

452
02:08:59,426 --> 02:09:06,690
[SPEAKER_16]: So part of what we appreciate being continuously invited back to Medford is you folks are talking about safe driving.

453
02:09:07,230 --> 02:09:08,970
[SPEAKER_16]: And we think that's a really important thing.

454
02:09:09,470 --> 02:09:18,932
[SPEAKER_16]: When we get an opportunity to run, you know, last, we were there last Tuesday, and we had over 250 some odd students sit in a vehicle with us and go through some demonstrations.

455
02:09:19,472 --> 02:09:21,753
[SPEAKER_16]: And we talked about, do you wear your seatbelt?

456
02:09:21,793 --> 02:09:23,013
[SPEAKER_16]: And I can tell you a lot of them didn't.

457
02:09:24,073 --> 02:09:26,794
[SPEAKER_16]: They told us they didn't, and they didn't want to when we put them in the car.

458
02:09:27,434 --> 02:09:32,375
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, when we slam on the brakes at 20 miles an hour, 25 miles an hour, they tended to buckle up pretty quick after that.

459
02:09:33,168 --> 02:09:35,950
[SPEAKER_16]: But it's an opportunity to show them we're not going very fast.

460
02:09:36,110 --> 02:09:38,653
[SPEAKER_16]: In an emergency, this can get out of control real quickly.

461
02:09:39,493 --> 02:09:41,835
[SPEAKER_16]: What we do down in Weymouth is a series of drills.

462
02:09:41,995 --> 02:09:43,156
[SPEAKER_16]: And again, we didn't invent this.

463
02:09:43,316 --> 02:09:46,299
[SPEAKER_16]: We stole it from the Europeans who crash at far lower rates than we do.

464
02:09:47,320 --> 02:09:55,186
[SPEAKER_16]: If you look at the kids in the first two years after they get their license here in Massachusetts, we're looking at north of 60% of them are crashing in the first two years.

465
02:09:55,607 --> 02:09:57,008
[SPEAKER_16]: That's why it's so expensive to insure them.

466
02:09:58,922 --> 02:10:00,604
[SPEAKER_16]: We put them through a series of different drills.

467
02:10:00,664 --> 02:10:04,047
[SPEAKER_16]: The very first thing we do, and I should take a moment and say we use our cars.

468
02:10:04,688 --> 02:10:07,991
[SPEAKER_16]: We go through tires every seven days, so you don't want to do this to your own car.

469
02:10:08,652 --> 02:10:09,833
[SPEAKER_16]: And we put them in a panic stop.

470
02:10:10,053 --> 02:10:15,439
[SPEAKER_16]: We have them travel down the runway, 50, 55 miles an hour, and aggressively slam on the brakes.

471
02:10:15,859 --> 02:10:17,161
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's a real world thing.

472
02:10:17,361 --> 02:10:19,243
[SPEAKER_16]: It happens every day on the highways that we're driving on.

473
02:10:20,060 --> 02:10:21,701
[SPEAKER_16]: and they get to experience what it's like.

474
02:10:21,821 --> 02:10:26,463
[SPEAKER_16]: And the seatbelt locks up, and that wheel gyrates, and the pedal pulsates, and it makes noises they've never heard.

475
02:10:27,044 --> 02:10:37,949
[SPEAKER_16]: And a lot of people, not just the teenagers, but this may happen to you guys if we need to come down and visit us, they freak out, and they take their foot off the brake, which is really counterproductive when I told you to stop that car as fast as you possibly can.

476
02:10:38,610 --> 02:10:41,011
[SPEAKER_16]: And they hit the wall of cones that we set up in front of them.

477
02:10:41,031 --> 02:10:46,714
[SPEAKER_16]: But what's really interesting is we repeat the drill, and 100% of the time, everybody stops without a problem.

478
02:10:47,250 --> 02:10:48,291
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's what we're doing with them.

479
02:10:48,311 --> 02:10:49,992
[SPEAKER_16]: It's about four and a half, five hours of training.

480
02:10:50,773 --> 02:10:56,057
[SPEAKER_16]: I wanna say thank you to Chief Buckley, Sergeant Canava, Dr. Cushing.

481
02:10:56,117 --> 02:10:58,239
[SPEAKER_16]: These folks have really made this program possible.

482
02:10:58,259 --> 02:11:03,263
[SPEAKER_16]: We're gonna have the opportunity for another 200 to 250 students to participate in this.

483
02:11:03,863 --> 02:11:05,244
[SPEAKER_16]: So we could use your help.

484
02:11:05,264 --> 02:11:07,986
[SPEAKER_16]: We could use the community's help with getting the word out about the program.

485
02:11:08,366 --> 02:11:13,591
[SPEAKER_16]: They can go down in a shuttle bus organized through the school, or they can come to us directly and they can just sign up on our website.

486
02:11:13,631 --> 02:11:15,252
[SPEAKER_16]: We have a special URL for them.

487
02:11:15,996 --> 02:11:18,518
[SPEAKER_16]: If I can answer any questions, I know we handed out some paperwork.

488
02:11:18,538 --> 02:11:20,400
[SPEAKER_16]: I just wanted to give you a little brief overview about it.

489
02:11:21,260 --> 02:11:24,243
[SPEAKER_16]: Our goal is to work with kids while they still have their permit, if we can.

490
02:11:24,723 --> 02:11:29,687
[SPEAKER_16]: But once they have their license, I was hoping to grab the rowing team and, you know, give them a big hug and then tell them we want to train you.

491
02:11:29,707 --> 02:11:32,670
[SPEAKER_16]: Because if you've got that license, you are not an expert.

492
02:11:33,451 --> 02:11:37,934
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, it's 1,000 hours of driving before you're likely to be considered an experienced driver.

493
02:11:38,615 --> 02:11:39,996
[SPEAKER_16]: And some of these kids got their license.

494
02:11:40,456 --> 02:11:44,880
[SPEAKER_16]: And, you know, the other thing, you go to some of these European countries, the road test is an hour.

495
02:11:45,285 --> 02:11:47,467
[SPEAKER_16]: Anybody here know how long the road test is here in Massachusetts?

496
02:11:48,968 --> 02:11:50,689
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, it can't be more than five minutes.

497
02:11:50,949 --> 02:11:55,653
[SPEAKER_16]: If there's a union issue, it pretty much ends at they need time to get the next car ready and that sort of thing.

498
02:11:56,373 --> 02:11:57,434
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not fair to our kids.

499
02:11:57,954 --> 02:11:58,535
[SPEAKER_16]: We can do better.

500
02:11:59,575 --> 02:12:00,816
[SPEAKER_16]: But any questions, I can answer.

501
02:12:01,997 --> 02:12:04,379
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember, Rizal?

502
02:12:04,839 --> 02:12:05,960
[SPEAKER_14]: I just wanted to say thank you.

503
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:09,723
[SPEAKER_14]: My daughter actually went through this program this year.

504
02:12:09,763 --> 02:12:10,783
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't remember exactly when.

505
02:12:11,444 --> 02:12:14,266
[SPEAKER_14]: And she's been driving a lot.

506
02:12:14,830 --> 02:12:22,572
[SPEAKER_14]: And the folks that, my sister has been in the car with her just this past weekend and said she's such a great driver.

507
02:12:22,592 --> 02:12:28,794
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll apologize now for any backseat driving that takes place now that she's watching you.

508
02:12:28,874 --> 02:12:33,576
[SPEAKER_14]: I let her drive if we're in the car together because I'm the backseat driver.

509
02:12:33,596 --> 02:12:34,496
[SPEAKER_09]: I like that, that's good.

510
02:12:34,516 --> 02:12:35,336
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you so much though.

511
02:12:35,376 --> 02:12:43,259
[SPEAKER_14]: It makes me feel a lot better, especially knowing that whole like the first time, I mean, I think, I don't know if everybody does, but I remember the first time anti-lock brakes

512
02:12:44,420 --> 02:12:46,842
[SPEAKER_14]: I experienced them, and it is terrifying.

513
02:12:47,843 --> 02:12:53,407
[SPEAKER_14]: It's better if that's not the actual time you need to stop from hitting another car or person, so thank you.

514
02:12:54,688 --> 02:12:57,570
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, thank you very much for presenting and for all you do for our students.

515
02:12:57,590 --> 02:12:59,031
[SPEAKER_06]: Appreciate it.

516
02:12:59,051 --> 02:12:59,432
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks, guys.

517
02:12:59,552 --> 02:13:00,052
[SPEAKER_16]: Take care.

518
02:13:03,675 --> 02:13:07,978
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a report of Medford Educational Foundation and recommendation to approve a donation.

519
02:13:07,998 --> 02:13:08,038
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

520
02:13:08,799 --> 02:13:10,240
[SPEAKER_06]: Paulette Vander Kloot is present.

521
02:13:10,300 --> 02:13:11,081
[SPEAKER_06]: She's the president of

522
02:13:14,318 --> 02:13:17,679
[SPEAKER_06]: Medford Educational Foundation and former Medford School Committee member, of course.

523
02:13:17,719 --> 02:13:17,939
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi.

524
02:13:18,119 --> 02:13:18,359
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi.

525
02:13:18,720 --> 02:13:19,820
[SPEAKER_19]: It's great to see everybody.

526
02:13:19,840 --> 02:13:21,000
[SPEAKER_19]: Welcome.

527
02:13:21,040 --> 02:13:21,861
[SPEAKER_10]: Good to see you, too.

528
02:13:21,881 --> 02:13:21,961
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

529
02:13:22,261 --> 02:13:23,061
[SPEAKER_19]: I have to look around.

530
02:13:24,822 --> 02:13:28,743
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm here today representing the Medford Educational Foundation.

531
02:13:29,223 --> 02:13:29,903
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm the president.

532
02:13:30,344 --> 02:13:40,107
[SPEAKER_19]: And this is David Sayers, my grants manager who manages all the grants that come in and organizes them for us.

533
02:13:40,787 --> 02:13:41,948
[SPEAKER_19]: We're also joined, I'm just going to,

534
02:13:43,428 --> 02:13:59,006
[SPEAKER_19]: Our treasurer, who wasn't able to be here, but Steve Hayes, Gail Arslanian member, Chris DeVita, also Diane Caldwell, a name you'll all know, is part of our merry little group.

535
02:13:59,827 --> 02:14:01,950
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think I got them all.

536
02:14:01,990 --> 02:14:02,510
[SPEAKER_19]: Did I get them all?

537
02:14:02,730 --> 02:14:03,191
[SPEAKER_19]: I got them all.

538
02:14:03,989 --> 02:14:11,292
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyway, what we've been very quietly doing for the last eight, maybe nine years is giving away money.

539
02:14:11,672 --> 02:14:15,434
[SPEAKER_19]: And of course it always amuses me that we have to come and ask you to accept it.

540
02:14:15,734 --> 02:14:20,436
[SPEAKER_19]: This amused me when I was sitting over there, because I would think you'd be so happy to take it you would just.

541
02:14:20,976 --> 02:14:36,722
[SPEAKER_19]: grab it from my hands and no need for formal approval but I'm here to give you $8,755 tonight to go towards the grants that teachers applied for so they we have a process where they write us their good ideas and

542
02:14:37,722 --> 02:14:39,743
[SPEAKER_19]: We weigh and deliberate over them.

543
02:14:40,664 --> 02:14:42,525
[SPEAKER_19]: Very often, we can't fund all of them.

544
02:14:43,085 --> 02:14:47,368
[SPEAKER_19]: We received more than $26,000 in requests, just to give you some idea.

545
02:14:47,848 --> 02:14:51,511
[SPEAKER_19]: So roughly, right now, we're funding about a third of it.

546
02:14:52,091 --> 02:14:53,872
[SPEAKER_19]: But last year, all together, we gave you over $16,000.

547
02:14:53,932 --> 02:14:55,673
[SPEAKER_19]: And we're about on track for that this year.

548
02:14:59,175 --> 02:15:09,439
[SPEAKER_19]: And the type of grants that we love to fund is, for your like example, the middle school librarians joined forces and asked us to fund a community read.

549
02:15:09,899 --> 02:15:14,360
[SPEAKER_19]: And we think that's a wonderful project to bring the middle school students together.

550
02:15:15,241 --> 02:15:20,162
[SPEAKER_19]: The Mississippi has asked us to fund, which we're partially funding, an author's visit.

551
02:15:20,202 --> 02:15:22,083
[SPEAKER_19]: They haven't had one for a very long time.

552
02:15:22,623 --> 02:15:27,345
[SPEAKER_19]: At the vocational school, they asked us for a brand new upgraded 3D printer.

553
02:15:28,725 --> 02:15:35,467
[SPEAKER_19]: and a much more expensive one than they've had, and we funded that at your last meeting.

554
02:15:35,507 --> 02:15:44,169
[SPEAKER_19]: You okayed a field trip experience for the United Nations Club, and we're giving them $1,000 towards that trip.

555
02:15:45,129 --> 02:15:48,309
[SPEAKER_19]: We have an after-school cooking club at the Andrews.

556
02:15:49,050 --> 02:15:50,170
[SPEAKER_19]: We think it's a great idea.

557
02:15:51,050 --> 02:15:53,431
[SPEAKER_19]: working on international food.

558
02:15:53,671 --> 02:15:56,531
[SPEAKER_19]: And so we're funding some of their expenses.

559
02:15:57,031 --> 02:15:58,232
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's the thing we do.

560
02:15:58,512 --> 02:16:00,972
[SPEAKER_19]: They're not earth shattering, but they sure are fun.

561
02:16:01,172 --> 02:16:05,153
[SPEAKER_19]: And we think that they add to a student's enjoyment.

562
02:16:05,293 --> 02:16:14,995
[SPEAKER_19]: And we know from the feedback that we get that the teachers really present, appreciate having another funding source that they can ask to for money.

563
02:16:15,435 --> 02:16:18,396
[SPEAKER_19]: One of the funds we just gave out was for 50 bucks.

564
02:16:19,116 --> 02:16:30,788
[SPEAKER_19]: And a teacher said, boy, really appreciate that very small amount of money, but that's something we can do and something which, frankly, I know that doesn't always happen on your end because it's a different thing.

565
02:16:31,428 --> 02:16:35,312
[SPEAKER_19]: So anyway, we are very, very grateful to the people who support us.

566
02:16:36,213 --> 02:16:40,918
[SPEAKER_19]: Needham Bank has been a great supporter of us, giving us over $5,000 for the last couple of years.

567
02:16:41,498 --> 02:16:48,483
[SPEAKER_19]: The Medford Community Fund has also contributed to us for several years running after we've written for grants.

568
02:16:48,903 --> 02:16:50,424
[SPEAKER_19]: And we're really an intermediary.

569
02:16:50,804 --> 02:16:52,345
[SPEAKER_19]: We collect money and we give it away.

570
02:16:52,565 --> 02:16:54,246
[SPEAKER_19]: As soon as we get money, we give it away.

571
02:16:54,706 --> 02:17:03,252
[SPEAKER_19]: And for that purpose, I'm going to let you know that the Kiwanis of Medford generously just let us know that we'll be receiving a check.

572
02:17:03,872 --> 02:17:24,242
[SPEAKER_19]: and at your next meeting in two weeks time I won't come again but I will ask you there will be an additional there were a couple grants we couldn't fund that we really wanted to so you'll see us come up again just for your approval and we thank the Kiwanis and Needham Bank and Mr. Gene Kalaw from Needham Bank for their incredible support.

573
02:17:25,703 --> 02:17:26,003
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyway,

574
02:17:27,631 --> 02:17:29,732
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that about covers it.

575
02:17:31,493 --> 02:17:32,233
[SPEAKER_19]: It's great to see you.

576
02:17:32,453 --> 02:17:36,815
[SPEAKER_19]: I have to always note that two of you used to be my students.

577
02:17:37,835 --> 02:17:42,577
[SPEAKER_19]: John and Aaron both volunteered at Winchester Hospital when I was there.

578
02:17:42,677 --> 02:17:46,438
[SPEAKER_19]: So it does amuse me that you both ended up on the school committee.

579
02:17:47,419 --> 02:17:51,280
[SPEAKER_19]: So anyway, who's gonna take the check and make sure it gets to the right place?

580
02:17:53,401 --> 02:17:53,681
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

581
02:17:57,438 --> 02:17:59,879
[SPEAKER_19]: And again, I'd really like to thank the very dedicated crew.

582
02:17:59,899 --> 02:18:04,760
[SPEAKER_19]: We're small, but we've been absolutely consistent for years working together.

583
02:18:05,160 --> 02:18:09,000
[SPEAKER_19]: And David's done a phenomenal job, and Steve Hayes, everybody.

584
02:18:09,040 --> 02:18:10,121
[SPEAKER_19]: So thank you very much.

585
02:18:11,021 --> 02:18:11,441
[SPEAKER_06]: Take care.

586
02:18:11,761 --> 02:18:12,581
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Paulette.

587
02:18:12,641 --> 02:18:13,281
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, David.

588
02:18:13,581 --> 02:18:14,361
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for all you do.

589
02:18:15,102 --> 02:18:15,782
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Ryanfilm?

590
02:18:17,562 --> 02:18:17,782
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

591
02:18:19,603 --> 02:18:20,203
[SPEAKER_06]: To officially.

592
02:18:20,223 --> 02:18:21,183
[SPEAKER_06]: To officially, yes.

593
02:18:21,263 --> 02:18:23,183
[SPEAKER_06]: I motion to officially accept the check.

594
02:18:23,423 --> 02:18:25,184
[SPEAKER_06]: And seconded by Member Graham.

595
02:18:25,704 --> 02:18:26,424
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

596
02:18:27,111 --> 02:18:28,112
[SPEAKER_06]: I was opposed.

597
02:18:28,873 --> 02:18:29,914
[SPEAKER_06]: Money has been accepted.

598
02:18:32,056 --> 02:18:32,416
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

599
02:18:33,838 --> 02:18:34,158
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

600
02:18:34,458 --> 02:18:36,801
[SPEAKER_06]: Number five, Medford High School bathroom update.

601
02:18:37,041 --> 02:18:38,302
[SPEAKER_06]: This is from resolution 2024-39.

602
02:18:39,743 --> 02:18:41,445
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have Ms.

603
02:18:41,665 --> 02:18:43,968
[SPEAKER_06]: Marta Cabral, our Medford High School principal.

604
02:18:44,408 --> 02:18:45,249
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for joining us.

605
02:18:56,920 --> 02:18:58,601
[SPEAKER_17]: Good evening, Madam Mayor and members of the School Committee.

606
02:18:58,621 --> 02:19:01,623
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll be joining Principal Cabral this evening in presenting.

607
02:19:01,643 --> 02:19:16,774
[SPEAKER_17]: I wanted to just quickly say that, you know, we are working as a district and high school leadership to really make sure that the bathrooms are open, that they're clean, and that we're trying to find ways to improve them constantly.

608
02:19:17,554 --> 02:19:42,959
[SPEAKER_17]: We recognize that all students and community members would more than likely want more done, but there are challenges being faced across the nation in high schools and in schools that Principal Cabral will be able to talk about briefly, but we wanted to make sure that we gave you a comprehensive look as to what's been done in the last few months and work going back several years.

609
02:19:43,179 --> 02:19:44,499
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'll turn it over to Principal Cabral.

610
02:19:45,905 --> 02:19:46,986
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, good evening everyone.

611
02:19:47,427 --> 02:19:55,677
[SPEAKER_13]: So I am here to share about the current schedule and planned openings of bathrooms, bathroom improvements and the current cleaning schedule that we have at Medford High School.

612
02:19:56,057 --> 02:20:04,908
[SPEAKER_13]: I do want to piggyback off of Dr. Cushing and say I'm part of several cohorts of principals and administrators in Massachusetts and surrounding states.

613
02:20:05,929 --> 02:20:18,825
[SPEAKER_13]: And it is a topic of conversation at every single one of our roundtables that we have, we have many agenda items and I would say the bathrooms are always number one on the priority list of how to make them better.

614
02:20:19,785 --> 02:20:22,546
[SPEAKER_13]: and more inclusive for our students.

615
02:20:22,986 --> 02:20:37,689
[SPEAKER_13]: That being said, we're making great strides at Medford High School and we are continuously working to improve and are always open to suggestions or any feedback that you have in order to make our bathrooms the best place for our students to be able to use comfortably.

616
02:20:38,249 --> 02:20:45,231
[SPEAKER_13]: So that being said, the few slides that I put together is the current schedule and planned openings for bathrooms.

617
02:20:45,711 --> 02:20:46,811
[SPEAKER_13]: Currently we have

618
02:20:47,932 --> 02:20:55,659
[SPEAKER_13]: signs on all of our bathroom doors that include the schedule, periods one through three and periods five through six, the house offices.

619
02:20:55,739 --> 02:20:58,921
[SPEAKER_13]: So in the C building, all of the house office bathrooms are open.

620
02:20:59,502 --> 02:21:05,686
[SPEAKER_13]: During period four, it's the lunch block, which poses a little bit more of a challenge for staffing.

621
02:21:06,027 --> 02:21:08,889
[SPEAKER_13]: And we have the cafeteria bathrooms open.

622
02:21:09,349 --> 02:21:13,773
[SPEAKER_13]: I would say that all students are aware of which bathrooms are open at which times.

623
02:21:14,293 --> 02:21:18,555
[SPEAKER_13]: We do have announcements in the morning where we do periodically put them in.

624
02:21:18,715 --> 02:21:30,320
[SPEAKER_13]: I would say the first four weeks of school, we always have announcements of the bathrooms that are currently open as we do have freshmen that are not accustomed to having a bathroom schedule.

625
02:21:32,200 --> 02:21:37,742
[SPEAKER_13]: The gender neutral bathrooms that we have currently, we have one in the main office that is at use.

626
02:21:37,802 --> 02:21:39,162
[SPEAKER_13]: There's no questions asked.

627
02:21:39,222 --> 02:21:40,703
[SPEAKER_13]: A student knows that they can go in.

628
02:21:41,123 --> 02:21:42,743
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a single stall bathroom.

629
02:21:43,083 --> 02:21:45,684
[SPEAKER_13]: We have one in the S house office as well.

630
02:21:45,764 --> 02:21:46,624
[SPEAKER_13]: Same process.

631
02:21:46,964 --> 02:21:49,925
[SPEAKER_13]: We have one now in the CTE office that we have opened.

632
02:21:50,345 --> 02:22:02,349
[SPEAKER_13]: And we also have one in the main foyer area that they do need to ask for a key just because it's a little bit hidden but they ask that from the from the security monitor there, and they're able to use it with no questions asked.

633
02:22:02,649 --> 02:22:06,390
[SPEAKER_13]: So we have a total of four gender neutral bathrooms, one per floor.

634
02:22:07,250 --> 02:22:08,932
[SPEAKER_13]: dedicated for our students to use.

635
02:22:09,512 --> 02:22:13,235
[SPEAKER_13]: We have been having a lot of discussion about opening the CTE bathrooms.

636
02:22:13,335 --> 02:22:22,462
[SPEAKER_13]: We have heard from CTE students that it is becoming a challenge to have to cross over to the comprehensive side to the C building.

637
02:22:23,383 --> 02:22:24,444
[SPEAKER_13]: And because

638
02:22:25,044 --> 02:22:26,545
[SPEAKER_13]: students have advocated for it.

639
02:22:26,605 --> 02:22:30,307
[SPEAKER_13]: We have been able to shift our security monitors.

640
02:22:30,367 --> 02:22:36,931
[SPEAKER_13]: They're zoned right now as to where they are supervising, and we have been able to rezone one of them.

641
02:22:36,991 --> 02:22:46,976
[SPEAKER_13]: We plan to open that by Monday in order to honor the CTE students and being able to not miss instructional time, which is important.

642
02:22:52,441 --> 02:22:55,183
[SPEAKER_13]: We have done several bathroom improvements.

643
02:22:55,743 --> 02:23:03,990
[SPEAKER_13]: We have improved 12 bathrooms, mainly in the C building because those were the ones that need the most attention.

644
02:23:04,390 --> 02:23:08,293
[SPEAKER_13]: The CTE bathrooms had been renovated, I think, in the past 10 years.

645
02:23:09,834 --> 02:23:13,317
[SPEAKER_13]: So we really wanted to focus our efforts in the C building.

646
02:23:13,777 --> 02:23:20,342
[SPEAKER_13]: We have gotten all new special paint for the tiles that is all repainted, new mirrors, new countertops.

647
02:23:21,362 --> 02:23:25,424
[SPEAKER_13]: fixtures in the bathrooms to update it and make it look a little bit more modern.

648
02:23:25,824 --> 02:23:38,250
[SPEAKER_13]: We've also had deep cleaning that was done by the painting company, where they completely power washed all of the floors, walls, the dividers, and all of the fixtures that are in the bathroom before they painted it.

649
02:23:39,511 --> 02:23:43,472
[SPEAKER_13]: So we feel like, is there more that we can do?

650
02:23:43,753 --> 02:23:44,073
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure.

651
02:23:44,513 --> 02:23:46,394
[SPEAKER_13]: But we are in an aging building.

652
02:23:46,594 --> 02:23:48,895
[SPEAKER_13]: We call it a little bit of an antique building.

653
02:23:49,295 --> 02:23:54,543
[SPEAKER_13]: where we have to do with what we have, but we can ensure that they're cleaned.

654
02:23:54,903 --> 02:23:56,605
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's what's important to us.

655
02:23:57,887 --> 02:24:03,055
[SPEAKER_13]: Proposals for bathroom improvements is a purchase of a grout cleaner.

656
02:24:03,095 --> 02:24:05,318
[SPEAKER_13]: That is something that we desperately need

657
02:24:05,738 --> 02:24:10,799
[SPEAKER_13]: The floors is where a lot of the smell comes from, especially with the age.

658
02:24:10,859 --> 02:24:19,121
[SPEAKER_13]: So we really need some sort of machine to be able to clean it, at least on a weekly basis, because it is so porous because of the age.

659
02:24:19,901 --> 02:24:28,703
[SPEAKER_13]: So we are proposing that that would be something that would help with the cleanliness of it, as well as with the smell that we can sometimes, just because of the age of the building.

660
02:24:29,736 --> 02:24:36,821
[SPEAKER_13]: Additionally, buildings and ground staff, we could always use more people just dedicated to cleaning of the building.

661
02:24:37,461 --> 02:24:53,491
[SPEAKER_13]: We were able to hire a new buildings and ground staff member that is dedicated to just cleaning and cleans all of the bathrooms, something that we weren't able to do in the past to make sure that the cleaning schedule is adhered to and that bathrooms are attended to every day.

662
02:25:00,872 --> 02:25:02,633
[SPEAKER_13]: Additionally, we have a camera.

663
02:25:02,753 --> 02:25:04,334
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, do you want to go ahead?

664
02:25:04,374 --> 02:25:05,474
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Russo, sorry.

665
02:25:05,494 --> 02:25:12,057
[SPEAKER_14]: Saying that these bathrooms are cleaned.

666
02:25:13,260 --> 02:25:19,164
[SPEAKER_14]: essentially twice a day with this many people, teenagers in particular, and that's it?

667
02:25:19,725 --> 02:25:24,348
[SPEAKER_13]: So the deep cleaning happens for the seaside building of the house office.

668
02:25:24,408 --> 02:25:26,329
[SPEAKER_13]: When we close them, we do the deep cleaning.

669
02:25:26,369 --> 02:25:31,133
[SPEAKER_13]: So that includes, and I think I might've put a slide, oh, it's actually on the next slide.

670
02:25:31,593 --> 02:25:33,314
[SPEAKER_13]: Everything is deep cleaned with solution.

671
02:25:33,614 --> 02:25:34,555
[SPEAKER_13]: The floors are mopped.

672
02:25:36,016 --> 02:25:38,257
[SPEAKER_13]: swept and mopped and everything is replenished.

673
02:25:38,597 --> 02:25:44,259
[SPEAKER_13]: We do have the person coming in regularly once per hour to make sure that they're like sweeping up the floor.

674
02:25:44,319 --> 02:25:45,860
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't really call that a deep cleaning.

675
02:25:45,920 --> 02:25:53,122
[SPEAKER_13]: I call that like a tidying, but to make sure that if there's anything that needs, um, attention that we are doing it.

676
02:25:53,222 --> 02:25:59,525
[SPEAKER_13]: But when the bill, when the, when the bathrooms are closed is when she is going in to be able to do the deep, deep scrub.

677
02:25:59,785 --> 02:26:00,065
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

678
02:26:03,332 --> 02:26:05,216
[SPEAKER_13]: I just can't see off of that.

679
02:26:06,618 --> 02:26:06,899
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

680
02:26:10,100 --> 02:26:29,855
[SPEAKER_13]: The installation of additional cameras to cover all bathroom entrances, all of our cameras in the hallways and the C building do not necessarily point in the directions that we need to point them at and that we need to see and be able to look at surveillance for who is entering and exiting the bathroom.

681
02:26:29,956 --> 02:26:34,239
[SPEAKER_13]: Some do, some just need to be more updated so we have more of like a 180 360 view.

682
02:26:35,780 --> 02:26:38,201
[SPEAKER_13]: of the hallways, and that is something that we are proposing.

683
02:26:38,821 --> 02:26:53,164
[SPEAKER_13]: And then lastly, through the mayor, and actually I do want to acknowledge our students reached out to the mayor for some halo detectors, which detect vape smoke, smoke in general, and also our noise detectors.

684
02:26:53,585 --> 02:27:00,646
[SPEAKER_13]: So if it's over a certain decibel, it actually alerts us, and that would mean that there's probably more than three people in the bathroom.

685
02:27:00,686 --> 02:27:03,147
[SPEAKER_13]: That's really the decibel level that we have it, so we're able to

686
02:27:03,627 --> 02:27:12,030
[SPEAKER_13]: go to the bathroom to attend to the student or to clear out the bathroom, we would like to have additional ones added.

687
02:27:12,330 --> 02:27:17,232
[SPEAKER_13]: Right now we have four, and we would like to have them in all of the bathrooms.

688
02:27:21,693 --> 02:27:30,816
[SPEAKER_13]: And then lastly, I did mention this, the bathrooms are cleaned, deep cleaned when the bathrooms are closed, and then the evening crew also does a deep clean for the morning shift as well.

689
02:27:34,678 --> 02:27:40,642
[SPEAKER_17]: So some of our current challenges that Principal Quiral already mentioned are some hallways lack cameras.

690
02:27:41,583 --> 02:27:47,347
[SPEAKER_17]: Just how the security system was deployed, there are some hallways that lack cameras, especially on bathrooms.

691
02:27:47,387 --> 02:27:49,088
[SPEAKER_17]: So knowing who goes in, who comes out.

692
02:27:49,808 --> 02:28:02,797
[SPEAKER_17]: There are certain plumbing concerns with the disposal of items down toilets that is causing us some significant challenges in the aging facility and aging pipes.

693
02:28:05,839 --> 02:28:18,285
[SPEAKER_17]: correct and there are correct that this requires sometimes us to call in not sometimes we're frequently calling in plumbers to repair the issue but then also needing to call in a jet

694
02:28:20,266 --> 02:28:27,611
[SPEAKER_17]: a jet plumbing service to literally blast through the clogs that are happening because of items being disposed.

695
02:28:28,112 --> 02:28:31,154
[SPEAKER_17]: So the halo detectors, right now it's a pilot program.

696
02:28:31,234 --> 02:28:32,295
[SPEAKER_17]: We have limited deployment.

697
02:28:33,075 --> 02:28:37,818
[SPEAKER_17]: Personally, we'd like to see—we painted 12 bathrooms over the summer.

698
02:28:37,858 --> 02:28:39,600
[SPEAKER_17]: We did a lot of work in 12 bathrooms.

699
02:28:40,080 --> 02:28:45,244
[SPEAKER_17]: We would like to—we put those four halo detectors in

700
02:28:46,505 --> 02:28:47,586
[SPEAKER_17]: some of those 12 bathrooms.

701
02:28:48,006 --> 02:28:49,188
[SPEAKER_17]: We would like to add an additional 12.

702
02:28:49,528 --> 02:28:58,359
[SPEAKER_17]: These would be for the third floor science wing bathrooms that were renovated brand new 10 years ago when those science labs were done.

703
02:28:58,759 --> 02:29:01,182
[SPEAKER_17]: Those bathrooms were first opened to students in 2021.

704
02:29:05,618 --> 02:29:13,388
[SPEAKER_17]: have an odor in the boys bathroom that is probably urine on aged urine on heating.

705
02:29:13,769 --> 02:29:20,417
[SPEAKER_17]: So we're hoping that the cleaning equipment and training will aid in getting rid of these smells.

706
02:29:21,458 --> 02:29:40,688
[SPEAKER_17]: staffing, looking for, say, two additional staff members to really help with movement around bathrooms, to make sure that that would help us to maintain keeping as many bathrooms open as possible, to really shrink the zones that the high school is using, and to make sure that we have a quick response.

707
02:29:42,765 --> 02:29:50,268
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, in November 26 on November 26 2019 requested this information from the city clerk.

708
02:29:50,688 --> 02:29:58,351
[SPEAKER_17]: I also uploaded to the drive, a report that I gave in I think January of 2020 pre pandemic so.

709
02:29:59,612 --> 02:30:04,717
[SPEAKER_17]: $300,000 in free cash was awarded to the school department to upgrade the intercom system, $59,100.

710
02:30:05,478 --> 02:30:13,627
[SPEAKER_17]: Shades in the C building of Medford High School on the first floor were derelict, so those were replaced.

711
02:30:14,088 --> 02:30:16,791
[SPEAKER_17]: If any of you have done window treatments, you know those are not cheap.

712
02:30:17,491 --> 02:30:22,273
[SPEAKER_17]: $32,500.

713
02:30:17,511 --> 02:30:22,273
[SPEAKER_17]: Two bathrooms, we'll come back to that at $100,000.

714
02:30:22,733 --> 02:30:28,735
[SPEAKER_17]: Technology for new makerspace and sun-setting desktops was $47,500.

715
02:30:28,975 --> 02:30:33,957
[SPEAKER_17]: A significant amount of that went to the electrical upgrades needed for the makerspace.

716
02:30:34,717 --> 02:30:36,358
[SPEAKER_17]: It was a little shocking how much that was.

717
02:30:36,798 --> 02:30:42,340
[SPEAKER_17]: And then generator repair and replacement, which, in all honesty, that was

718
02:30:43,860 --> 02:30:50,445
[SPEAKER_17]: kind of pre-me, first year me, that was a quote that did not include installation costs.

719
02:30:50,925 --> 02:30:52,867
[SPEAKER_17]: So we have not been able to do that work.

720
02:30:53,147 --> 02:30:59,731
[SPEAKER_17]: However, where we are in the Medford High School building process, that might be something we want to reconsider at this point.

721
02:31:00,352 --> 02:31:07,037
[SPEAKER_17]: And what we've been looking for is we spent $17,000 or so to paint the bathrooms this summer.

722
02:31:08,098 --> 02:31:13,123
[SPEAKER_17]: Through ARPA, it was approximately, it was under $10,000 to do the halo sensors.

723
02:31:13,703 --> 02:31:20,250
[SPEAKER_17]: We've budgeted those at around $3,500 because there was a Motorola coupon special on those four sensors.

724
02:31:21,071 --> 02:31:23,273
[SPEAKER_17]: Believe it or not, there was a coupon.

725
02:31:23,933 --> 02:31:24,494
[SPEAKER_17]: I swear to God.

726
02:31:27,168 --> 02:31:27,888
[SPEAKER_17]: You can't make it.

727
02:31:28,289 --> 02:31:40,994
[SPEAKER_17]: But anyway, so we're proposing for the 12 remaining bathrooms would be $3,500 per bathroom that includes all wiring systems, those types of things, $42,000 in total estimated cost.

728
02:31:41,715 --> 02:31:47,597
[SPEAKER_17]: The grout cleaning machine, this is a machine that essentially is a mobile pressure washer that has numerous attachments.

729
02:31:47,857 --> 02:31:48,718
[SPEAKER_17]: One of the attachments

730
02:31:49,758 --> 02:31:51,560
[SPEAKER_17]: does the grout cleaning that we needed to do.

731
02:31:51,620 --> 02:31:58,084
[SPEAKER_17]: There are other attachments that can do fabric, upholstery, rugs, and other things that honestly I gave up after a few.

732
02:31:59,105 --> 02:32:12,514
[SPEAKER_17]: So that grout cleaning machine, cameras, 10 additional cameras to cover additional areas, to cover additional bathrooms and other areas of the school, 4,000 per camera, $40,000 total cost.

733
02:32:13,015 --> 02:32:14,816
[SPEAKER_17]: Total proposed facility cost is $94,000.

734
02:32:16,337 --> 02:32:21,939
[SPEAKER_17]: We have spent right around the $200,000 of the free cash.

735
02:32:23,039 --> 02:32:36,263
[SPEAKER_17]: So we have funds available to us out of the free cash to continue investing in the Medford High School bathrooms in these areas, which is not exorbitant, I guess.

736
02:32:36,523 --> 02:32:44,005
[SPEAKER_17]: The last thing I will say is the initial idea of two bathrooms was to do a full renovation.

737
02:32:45,600 --> 02:33:03,103
[SPEAKER_17]: We still have the plans for that, but number one, it proved that it would not make the bathrooms ADA accessible, and $100,000 to do two bathrooms, even in pre-pandemic pricing, was woefully underfunded.

738
02:33:04,003 --> 02:33:11,805
[SPEAKER_17]: To really renovate these bathrooms would require substantial infrastructure changes to the plumbing,

739
02:33:12,705 --> 02:33:13,725
[SPEAKER_17]: taking down walls.

740
02:33:14,385 --> 02:33:22,167
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a custodial closet that's a part of these, like call it a cluster, girls' room, boys' room, custodial closet.

741
02:33:23,128 --> 02:33:30,530
[SPEAKER_17]: One of the thoughts was to take everything out and do a boys' room, a girls' room, a boys' room on each side alternating.

742
02:33:30,910 --> 02:33:35,071
[SPEAKER_17]: So you essentially go from having six and six to having three and three but bigger.

743
02:33:35,891 --> 02:33:38,432
[SPEAKER_17]: trying to do ADA, that proved not to be the case.

744
02:33:39,052 --> 02:33:53,818
[SPEAKER_17]: Even if we wanted to gut these bathrooms as they are, take them down to the studs and rebuild them back out, I forget specifically because it is five years ago and we couldn't find the quote, the tile costs alone exceeded the $100,000.

745
02:33:53,858 --> 02:33:54,298
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

746
02:33:54,318 --> 02:33:54,418
[SPEAKER_17]: So

747
02:33:58,723 --> 02:34:03,145
[SPEAKER_17]: I just wanted to give you a very clear update on what that free cash was.

748
02:34:03,185 --> 02:34:07,527
[SPEAKER_17]: It was $300,000 that the City Council approved.

749
02:34:08,288 --> 02:34:19,953
[SPEAKER_17]: We have been very diligent in using it to pay for what was intended, with the exception of the generator repair and replacement, which turned out, again, to be a massive project that $61,000 did not.

750
02:34:20,093 --> 02:34:25,556
[SPEAKER_17]: If you ever want to know, I'm happy to talk to you about generator replacement, but I don't think that's the focus of tonight.

751
02:34:28,384 --> 02:34:34,108
[SPEAKER_17]: I will stop the screen share now in case there's anyone online or any members of the committee that would like to comment.

752
02:34:34,608 --> 02:34:35,489
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

753
02:34:35,509 --> 02:34:39,911
[SPEAKER_06]: A question from the chair on the smoke and vape detectors.

754
02:34:42,453 --> 02:34:45,635
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously, you'd like to order more, so they must be useful.

755
02:34:45,655 --> 02:34:49,297
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought I did either receive an email or got word that

756
02:34:51,328 --> 02:34:53,768
[SPEAKER_06]: teens were taking them off the ceiling.

757
02:34:54,129 --> 02:34:58,949
[SPEAKER_06]: So have we prevented that in any way, or is that something you just run in and catch who's done it?

758
02:34:59,409 --> 02:35:08,311
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, so we actually were able to catch the students that were in there at that very moment, because it just happened that we were on the app and we got the alert and we were able to go up there.

759
02:35:08,351 --> 02:35:12,172
[SPEAKER_13]: It has only happened once, and it only happened at that one very time.

760
02:35:13,172 --> 02:35:15,552
[SPEAKER_13]: So we were going to get cages.

761
02:35:15,572 --> 02:35:17,513
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess there's cages that you can put around them.

762
02:35:17,533 --> 02:35:18,793
[SPEAKER_13]: We haven't needed to do that.

763
02:35:19,133 --> 02:35:23,017
[SPEAKER_13]: because it was one isolated incident that that happened.

764
02:35:23,417 --> 02:35:28,582
[SPEAKER_13]: The other thing that we've been working on is, you know, taking care of our space and our community at Medford High School.

765
02:35:28,962 --> 02:35:31,685
[SPEAKER_13]: And we are making great gains in that both in the bathroom.

766
02:35:31,745 --> 02:35:40,914
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think like this incident was a perfect example of us being able to then, you know, over announcements and at our community events, talk about the importance of taking care of of

767
02:35:41,417 --> 02:35:42,960
[SPEAKER_13]: our community and our building.

768
02:35:44,103 --> 02:35:48,853
[SPEAKER_13]: With the vape detectors that we have, we're able to collect the data and look at the data.

769
02:35:49,134 --> 02:35:52,140
[SPEAKER_13]: We have had a significant decrease in the amount of

770
02:35:53,563 --> 02:35:54,744
[SPEAKER_13]: vaping, what are they called?

771
02:35:54,784 --> 02:36:02,510
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know, alerts, because it can be noise level as well as to when it first started to now, is there improvement that we can do 100%?

772
02:36:02,550 --> 02:36:05,173
[SPEAKER_13]: We can always improve.

773
02:36:05,613 --> 02:36:06,934
[SPEAKER_13]: Are students still vaping?

774
02:36:07,094 --> 02:36:09,156
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, but they're not vaping in the bathrooms.

775
02:36:09,216 --> 02:36:17,263
[SPEAKER_13]: They're vaping a lot less so that we're providing students a safe place to be able to use the bathroom and one that they feel comfortable walking in.

776
02:36:17,691 --> 02:36:24,974
[SPEAKER_13]: We are creating, we were hoping to get the vape detectors installed over the summer to be able to do some trial and error with them.

777
02:36:26,015 --> 02:36:35,139
[SPEAKER_13]: We were unable to do that so we are slowly developing an action plan as to how can we once, how can we best

778
02:36:36,660 --> 02:36:40,783
[SPEAKER_13]: improve and use the tools that we have currently in the bathrooms.

779
02:36:41,123 --> 02:36:57,095
[SPEAKER_13]: That being said, the cameras, and that's where the cameras come into play, would be really supporting the technology that we have of the halo wave detectors to see who is entering and exiting the bathrooms at those certain times, and we don't have that on all of the floors currently right now.

780
02:36:59,036 --> 02:36:59,336
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

781
02:36:59,556 --> 02:37:05,439
[SPEAKER_17]: I would also just like to add briefly that this isn't about disciplining students.

782
02:37:05,819 --> 02:37:14,802
[SPEAKER_17]: The vape detectors and any related technology or any work that the high school leadership is doing is about directing students into the diversion programs.

783
02:37:15,563 --> 02:37:16,603
[SPEAKER_17]: There are two available.

784
02:37:17,203 --> 02:37:20,285
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not going to go into the specifics right now, but there are two available.

785
02:37:20,665 --> 02:37:24,626
[SPEAKER_17]: This is about having students understand how bad vapes are for them.

786
02:37:26,714 --> 02:37:29,256
[SPEAKER_17]: hopefully moving them off them through these diversion programs.

787
02:37:30,216 --> 02:37:32,917
[SPEAKER_06]: And what does a diversion program look like, if I may, from the chair?

788
02:37:32,977 --> 02:37:34,018
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it just like an hour?

789
02:37:34,078 --> 02:37:35,379
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it videos?

790
02:37:35,439 --> 02:37:35,679
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it

791
02:37:36,465 --> 02:37:46,708
[SPEAKER_13]: We actually have, through MGH's stipend and position of a diversion program that we have at the high school where if they are caught vaping, they're immediately put into that.

792
02:37:46,808 --> 02:37:56,011
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's a certain amount of sessions that they have to complete where it's educating them about the use of vaping as well as with the health effects.

793
02:37:56,491 --> 02:38:03,793
[SPEAKER_13]: So that is the restorative practice that we are using because just saying no, don't do it or just putting them in Saturday

794
02:38:04,133 --> 02:38:09,977
[SPEAKER_13]: detention or just giving them a punishment is not going to work as to we want to educate them.

795
02:38:10,237 --> 02:38:11,018
[SPEAKER_13]: Wonderful, wonderful.

796
02:38:11,058 --> 02:38:11,378
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

797
02:38:11,838 --> 02:38:13,420
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Graham.

798
02:38:13,720 --> 02:38:14,200
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

799
02:38:14,420 --> 02:38:28,190
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you just clarify for me, when you say that we finally have somebody who is able to clean the bathrooms, how many custodians are on the day shift at Medford High?

800
02:38:28,210 --> 02:38:32,993
[SPEAKER_17]: It's either six or seven.

801
02:38:33,554 --> 02:38:33,694
[SPEAKER_17]: Just

802
02:38:35,231 --> 02:38:36,111
[SPEAKER_17]: depending on the day.

803
02:38:36,732 --> 02:38:40,213
[SPEAKER_17]: It's 7, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.

804
02:38:40,233 --> 02:38:43,514
[SPEAKER_17]: It is 6, Thursday, Friday.

805
02:38:45,734 --> 02:38:54,977
[SPEAKER_11]: So I know the seventh person was a new position that we added, which is great.

806
02:38:55,097 --> 02:39:02,460
[SPEAKER_11]: But why can't we clean the bathrooms more if we have seven people on staff?

807
02:39:03,390 --> 02:39:06,552
[SPEAKER_11]: who are there to keep the building clean.

808
02:39:08,092 --> 02:39:09,733
[SPEAKER_17]: That is definitely something we're working on.

809
02:39:10,474 --> 02:39:23,560
[SPEAKER_17]: We're also working with our custodial supplier, KC Products, to offer trainings on how to properly deep clean bathrooms and to make sure that those skills are not disused.

810
02:39:24,167 --> 02:39:40,569
[SPEAKER_17]: So we do have, we have, we just had one training at one of the last half days and we are scheduling a bathroom cleaning training for our staff so that we have a clear standard and expectation of how we want them to look.

811
02:39:41,506 --> 02:39:54,778
[SPEAKER_17]: It's also, it is high on my priority list as someone who oversees this category to make sure that the high school bathrooms are well cleaned, well sterilized.

812
02:39:55,278 --> 02:40:08,170
[SPEAKER_17]: And so that when students go in there, not only do they have an environment where people are not congregating and doing things that they shouldn't be doing, but they have a clean environment to use for what they need to do for hopefully is a brief time and then get back to class.

813
02:40:10,365 --> 02:40:10,845
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

814
02:40:11,186 --> 02:40:29,611
[SPEAKER_11]: So I don't see anything in here about opening more bathrooms per se, which I am in support of all the ways that you're proposing to spend the capital funding that we have.

815
02:40:31,152 --> 02:40:37,434
[SPEAKER_11]: And I would be happy to make a motion tonight, but how do we open more bathrooms?

816
02:40:38,450 --> 02:40:45,312
[SPEAKER_13]: So we are going to open the CTE bathrooms by Monday.

817
02:40:46,053 --> 02:40:52,515
[SPEAKER_13]: Like I said, we've really been working with our security monitors of how we can redistribute them in the zones.

818
02:40:54,183 --> 02:41:13,193
[SPEAKER_13]: The architecture of the high school is very challenging as to where the, we all know this, of where the bathrooms are located and just the amount of space that our security, and we are very fortunate with how many we have, but just the amount of space that we have at the high school, it's thin for the amount of security monitors that we have.

819
02:41:13,694 --> 02:41:20,857
[SPEAKER_13]: That being said, we are making it a priority to reassign them their zones to be able to open CTE by Monday morning.

820
02:41:22,768 --> 02:41:27,964
[SPEAKER_11]: And then why are the bathrooms in the B building never open?

821
02:41:29,076 --> 02:41:30,957
[SPEAKER_17]: That's been a coverage issue.

822
02:41:31,938 --> 02:41:40,443
[SPEAKER_17]: Surprisingly, when we did open them over the past couple of years, those, despite being the newest and nicest, were heavily vandalized at times.

823
02:41:42,104 --> 02:41:46,826
[SPEAKER_17]: So they have been closed for cleaning or repair or things like that at times.

824
02:41:47,287 --> 02:41:50,709
[SPEAKER_17]: Right now, it's literally a coverage and staffing issue.

825
02:41:51,329 --> 02:41:57,713
[SPEAKER_17]: Other high schools have the benefit, or however you look at it, of staff having duties.

826
02:41:58,813 --> 02:42:06,794
[SPEAKER_17]: And it may be that your duty is to sit outside a bathroom, or your duty is fill in the blank of anything that may be.

827
02:42:07,383 --> 02:42:10,164
[SPEAKER_17]: That's not really an option for us at this time.

828
02:42:11,725 --> 02:42:33,013
[SPEAKER_17]: And it does pose challenges when then things that in other places would be an opportunity to have staff not only being there as a set of eyes, but also relationship building and those types of things comes with additional fiscal realities.

829
02:42:33,533 --> 02:42:48,384
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's either two additional staff, be they engagement specialists or monitors or however we want to look at it in a broad sense, or it's figuring out a way to fund mispreps.

830
02:42:50,525 --> 02:42:50,806
[SPEAKER_11]: Got it.

831
02:42:51,326 --> 02:43:02,294
[SPEAKER_11]: So essentially, if we had two more staff members, you could open how many more bathrooms?

832
02:43:03,180 --> 02:43:11,186
[SPEAKER_13]: We would be able to open the B bathroom because I would have someone zoned specifically there in the B3 in the science wing as well as the CTE.

833
02:43:11,226 --> 02:43:17,771
[SPEAKER_13]: The CTE bathroom we're going to make work for now, but it would really provide full coverage for areas that are not as trafficked.

834
02:43:18,511 --> 02:43:20,292
[SPEAKER_11]: And what if you only had one staff member?

835
02:43:23,255 --> 02:43:30,960
[SPEAKER_13]: Then I would be able to open the B3 bathroom with the plan that we currently have for the CTE bathroom to be opened on Monday.

836
02:43:32,001 --> 02:43:32,201
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

837
02:43:32,520 --> 02:43:33,080
[SPEAKER_11]: That's helpful.

838
02:43:34,441 --> 02:43:42,683
[SPEAKER_11]: And then, Dr. Cushing, you said something that I think was polite in terms of what was happening.

839
02:43:43,323 --> 02:43:47,045
[SPEAKER_11]: Students are flushing vapes and causing plumbing damage.

840
02:43:47,425 --> 02:43:47,605
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

841
02:43:47,985 --> 02:43:49,385
[SPEAKER_11]: That is very expensive.

842
02:43:49,485 --> 02:43:50,526
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that what you were saying?

843
02:43:50,766 --> 02:43:51,386
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

844
02:43:52,086 --> 02:43:53,487
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't have those costs in front of me.

845
02:43:53,547 --> 02:43:54,607
[SPEAKER_17]: We haven't been able to pull them yet.

846
02:43:55,587 --> 02:43:57,528
[SPEAKER_17]: Our plumbing costs are through the roof.

847
02:43:59,108 --> 02:44:05,090
[SPEAKER_17]: We've definitely suffered broken pipes as a result of them and sewage backups.

848
02:44:05,450 --> 02:44:08,071
[SPEAKER_17]: So I understand students' frustrations.

849
02:44:08,511 --> 02:44:08,871
[SPEAKER_17]: I do.

850
02:44:10,432 --> 02:44:17,994
[SPEAKER_17]: And I will say that the situation at Medford High School is vastly better this year than it has been in previous years.

851
02:44:20,715 --> 02:44:21,796
[SPEAKER_17]: The vape problem is

852
02:44:23,743 --> 02:44:27,808
[SPEAKER_17]: it can't go understated, like what it's doing to our kids, what it's doing to our plumbing.

853
02:44:27,828 --> 02:44:41,783
[SPEAKER_17]: So I guess their plumbing, our plumbing, but it is, it is not, it is not, you know, and my last, my last stint as a principal was in Southern Worcester County and our school had only four bathrooms in it.

854
02:44:42,383 --> 02:44:43,424
[SPEAKER_17]: So eight boys and girls.

855
02:44:44,264 --> 02:44:53,367
[SPEAKER_17]: And we closed three of those groupings and had every student in the school go to a single grouping because the vaping was out of control and similar problems in 2018, 2019.

856
02:44:54,628 --> 02:44:57,729
[SPEAKER_17]: And yes, those are draconian measures.

857
02:44:58,309 --> 02:45:02,331
[SPEAKER_17]: We had nowhere near the staffing of Medford High School to cover those bathrooms.

858
02:45:02,751 --> 02:45:08,453
[SPEAKER_17]: And unfortunately, the last thing I ever wanna do is make a teacher sit and every student had to sign into the bathroom.

859
02:45:10,141 --> 02:45:12,182
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, that was 2018, 2019.

860
02:45:12,242 --> 02:45:25,486
[SPEAKER_17]: I only share that to say it is a problem that high school principals and middle school principals, I took the doors off my bathrooms because bad things were happening when kids thought they could be obscured.

861
02:45:26,067 --> 02:45:27,727
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, and we were able to do that.

862
02:45:27,847 --> 02:45:29,928
[SPEAKER_17]: They were set up in a way that was airport style.

863
02:45:30,648 --> 02:45:36,190
[SPEAKER_17]: This is a problem that unfortunately is really perplexing secondary school leaders.

864
02:45:37,358 --> 02:45:44,962
[SPEAKER_17]: I would also propose, not in this money, I would propose vape sensors in every single one of the middle school bathrooms, just FYI.

865
02:45:45,142 --> 02:45:45,582
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

866
02:45:45,882 --> 02:45:56,307
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think one request I have is that if you are talking to parents about their students vaping, that you're making them aware of the real cost.

867
02:45:56,687 --> 02:46:03,451
[SPEAKER_11]: Like every time we spend X dollars on plumbing, it's money that we are not able to spend on students.

868
02:46:04,031 --> 02:46:16,383
[SPEAKER_11]: doing something that will help them get an education, and I think we need to quantify that both for students and for parents, so that people can start to understand the consequences of the actions and decisions that they're making.

869
02:46:16,783 --> 02:46:22,569
[SPEAKER_11]: To your point, like being willing to take care of your community is important, but there's also a

870
02:46:23,649 --> 02:46:30,814
[SPEAKER_11]: very practical dollars and cents component of all of this, which is we can't just decide not to fix the plumbing.

871
02:46:31,835 --> 02:46:33,155
[SPEAKER_11]: We have to fix the plumbing.

872
02:46:33,255 --> 02:46:36,998
[SPEAKER_11]: So that means we will have to decide not to do something else.

873
02:46:37,574 --> 02:46:41,198
[SPEAKER_13]: And I know a big concern that we've heard is the bathroom closures.

874
02:46:41,458 --> 02:46:45,702
[SPEAKER_13]: And the bathroom closures happen because we have the plumbing issue.

875
02:46:45,782 --> 02:46:48,045
[SPEAKER_13]: So sometimes we're able to just close one stall.

876
02:46:48,125 --> 02:46:51,468
[SPEAKER_13]: Sometimes, because it's an overflow or whatnot, we have to close the whole bathroom.

877
02:46:51,789 --> 02:47:00,257
[SPEAKER_13]: So that is the reason why there is frustration about bathrooms being closed or being relocated, is it's a plumbing issue at times.

878
02:47:01,354 --> 02:47:05,376
[SPEAKER_11]: And can we just be really clear and transparent about that?

879
02:47:05,416 --> 02:47:08,778
[SPEAKER_11]: This bathroom is closed because of a plumbing issue.

880
02:47:10,699 --> 02:47:17,082
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, again, it's hard to help everybody make good decisions all the time.

881
02:47:17,162 --> 02:47:27,747
[SPEAKER_11]: But when you can see in real consequence what's happening to your classmates, hopefully that will deter some folks as well.

882
02:47:29,224 --> 02:47:42,778
[SPEAKER_11]: So what you are asking for in this proposal is essentially approval to proceed with the vape sensors, the grout cleaning machine and the cameras.

883
02:47:44,089 --> 02:47:48,073
[SPEAKER_11]: out of the capital funds that have been allocated for bathrooms.

884
02:47:48,773 --> 02:47:52,957
[SPEAKER_11]: And then two additional staff members, is that correct?

885
02:47:53,417 --> 02:47:59,662
[SPEAKER_17]: I think, well, I mean, the two additional staff members, I think we need a longer conversation of where in the budget that would come from.

886
02:47:59,682 --> 02:47:59,983
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure, yeah.

887
02:48:00,323 --> 02:48:08,850
[SPEAKER_11]: But I just wanna make sure I'm understanding, like, what are you asking us to think about spending, but not necessarily tonight, but what is- I mean, thinking about spending the 94.

888
02:48:10,671 --> 02:48:11,792
[SPEAKER_17]: which is already allocated.

889
02:48:12,232 --> 02:48:22,679
[SPEAKER_17]: There's also some leftover capital money from the significant amounts of it have been expended from the science renovation, science lab renovations.

890
02:48:23,540 --> 02:48:25,701
[SPEAKER_17]: There's still a little bit left available there.

891
02:48:25,941 --> 02:48:29,103
[SPEAKER_17]: So just to make sure that these are estimates.

892
02:48:29,904 --> 02:48:33,787
[SPEAKER_17]: I think they're good estimates based on lived experience over the past several months.

893
02:48:34,787 --> 02:48:38,570
[SPEAKER_17]: But to really make sure that we have what we need moving forward without

894
02:48:39,110 --> 02:48:42,611
[SPEAKER_17]: really tapping into the supplemental and other things.

895
02:48:43,851 --> 02:48:47,513
[SPEAKER_17]: But I want to make sure the committee is aware we're looking at about $94,000.

896
02:48:47,773 --> 02:48:56,275
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to make sure that these bathrooms are in the best shape that they can be in a 54-year-old structure where there was a lot of deferred maintenance.

897
02:48:57,796 --> 02:49:03,998
[SPEAKER_17]: Ideally, I'd love to be able to replace the heating elements in those bathrooms because I really don't know any way to get the

898
02:49:04,838 --> 02:49:06,019
[SPEAKER_17]: uric acid out of it.

899
02:49:07,019 --> 02:49:09,060
[SPEAKER_17]: So when those heat up is when the smells get bad.

900
02:49:10,161 --> 02:49:11,861
[SPEAKER_17]: So make you aware of those.

901
02:49:11,921 --> 02:49:13,322
[SPEAKER_17]: And then those two staff members.

902
02:49:14,182 --> 02:49:20,265
[SPEAKER_17]: And then a consideration of we'll have to think about what's the best assignment.

903
02:49:20,946 --> 02:49:21,346
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

904
02:49:22,206 --> 02:49:26,788
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a couple of motions, but I will let everybody else ask their questions.

905
02:49:26,828 --> 02:49:30,070
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think there's probably some folks online who may want to speak as well.

906
02:49:30,350 --> 02:49:31,250
[SPEAKER_06]: We have somebody online.

907
02:49:31,310 --> 02:49:32,071
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to go to.

908
02:49:33,129 --> 02:49:36,711
[SPEAKER_06]: Metro member Russo, the member Reinfeldt, then we'll take resident online.

909
02:49:37,072 --> 02:49:38,192
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and member Bramley.

910
02:49:38,212 --> 02:49:41,034
[SPEAKER_14]: I was first, right?

911
02:49:42,815 --> 02:49:53,602
[SPEAKER_14]: So I've really been thinking a lot about this bait problem, especially in light of today's Supreme Court arguments, which

912
02:49:54,790 --> 02:50:16,899
[SPEAKER_14]: if the anti-FDA, anti-regulation approach to government that we can expect happens, that we're going to see a massive spike in vape use because every flavor under the sun will become available instead of just menthol and the plain cigarette flavor.

913
02:50:17,740 --> 02:50:23,182
[SPEAKER_14]: And when that happens, I think we're going to have to really think hard about

914
02:50:24,516 --> 02:50:28,202
[SPEAKER_14]: what our comfort level is about detecting vapes on our students.

915
02:50:29,163 --> 02:50:36,135
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not interested in a metal detectors and I'm not interested in like making the place feel like a prison.

916
02:50:36,656 --> 02:50:37,317
[SPEAKER_14]: On the other hand,

917
02:50:38,746 --> 02:50:51,549
[SPEAKER_14]: the number of, the percentage of students and middle school students already using vapes is very disturbing without all of these flavored e-cigarettes being available.

918
02:50:52,409 --> 02:51:08,032
[SPEAKER_14]: So if the Supreme Court does overturn that and neuter the FDA in this regard, I think we're gonna have to really have some serious conversations about how direct we get about

919
02:51:08,894 --> 02:51:10,414
[SPEAKER_14]: checking every student for vapes.

920
02:51:10,594 --> 02:51:14,035
[SPEAKER_14]: And I know that there's equipment that can actually do that.

921
02:51:15,636 --> 02:51:17,056
[SPEAKER_14]: And I hope we're not there.

922
02:51:17,076 --> 02:51:18,717
[SPEAKER_14]: I hope we don't have to go there.

923
02:51:18,857 --> 02:51:27,999
[SPEAKER_14]: But I'm very concerned that the floodgates will be opened on vapes that will make them irresistible.

924
02:51:32,409 --> 02:51:35,011
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm glad we're having this conversation now.

925
02:51:36,212 --> 02:51:38,714
[SPEAKER_14]: I hope next year we're not having a different conversation.

926
02:51:40,976 --> 02:51:45,699
[SPEAKER_14]: So I certainly support the additional two people to be able to open up all the bathrooms.

927
02:51:46,239 --> 02:51:59,910
[SPEAKER_14]: About the expensive plumbing stuff repairs, aside from the signs, I do think that we should literally just put it in that morning announcements if there's room and it's not a big issue, because I don't think

928
02:52:00,771 --> 02:52:03,692
[SPEAKER_14]: And frankly, until you've owned a home, you don't have a clue at plumbing costs.

929
02:52:05,272 --> 02:52:20,677
[SPEAKER_14]: And so to just say, you know, bathroom, you know, this, the repairs were, you know, $16,000 or whatever they are, and put the bathroom out of water for two and a half weeks or whatever the real numbers are.

930
02:52:22,237 --> 02:52:25,018
[SPEAKER_14]: Because, and I think that there's messaging there that,

931
02:52:26,089 --> 02:52:31,371
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, for many students, those might also be relatively meaningless if you're not paying your own bills.

932
02:52:32,252 --> 02:52:35,513
[SPEAKER_14]: But you could also say, that means we will not have money to do.

933
02:52:35,733 --> 02:52:40,416
[SPEAKER_14]: And then you just graph a little list of things that cost money similar to those amounts.

934
02:52:40,476 --> 02:52:45,998
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're not going to get to do this in the school system, because instead we're fixing pipes because you threw your vapes away.

935
02:52:47,379 --> 02:52:52,721
[SPEAKER_14]: Because this budget is a limited amount of money, and that's just the way it is.

936
02:52:55,626 --> 02:52:59,787
[SPEAKER_14]: I think peer pressure, a healthy peer pressure can be useful here.

937
02:52:59,807 --> 02:53:16,191
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, I'm disappointed to hear about how many vapes are going in the plumbing, apparently in the boys' rooms more than the girls' rooms, but we need to make these things real.

938
02:53:16,231 --> 02:53:19,791
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's, you know, we have a whole financial literacy thing going on.

939
02:53:20,071 --> 02:53:22,232
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think for students that are going through that,

940
02:53:23,061 --> 02:53:28,785
[SPEAKER_14]: will start to get a grasp of what stuff costs when we start to tell them that like, yeah, you threw something in the toilet.

941
02:53:29,486 --> 02:53:40,374
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's costing if you've been through the financial literacy program, you know, four months of your salary or income, you know, that that's when it starts to be like, it costs more than a car.

942
02:53:42,715 --> 02:53:45,777
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think I'm hopeful that that can be useful.

943
02:53:46,918 --> 02:53:49,160
[SPEAKER_14]: Not that I know, I know that getting this information is

944
02:53:49,778 --> 02:54:02,526
[SPEAKER_14]: not like you can't click a button, but I appreciate all your work and hope we can get these vape sensors everywhere and the cameras so we can see who's going in and out of the rooms.

945
02:54:02,746 --> 02:54:03,086
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

946
02:54:03,806 --> 02:54:04,087
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

947
02:54:04,167 --> 02:54:05,487
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Reinfeldt and Member Brantley.

948
02:54:06,908 --> 02:54:10,971
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioned renovation couldn't get something up to ADA standards.

949
02:54:11,031 --> 02:54:13,772
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you confirm that we do have ADA accessible bathrooms?

950
02:54:14,653 --> 02:54:15,173
[SPEAKER_02]: We do.

951
02:54:19,633 --> 02:54:22,154
[SPEAKER_17]: but it's the science wing.

952
02:54:23,215 --> 02:54:35,620
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm just trying, the one in the main lobby, the main foyer that literally you'll see it was built like in the, it was carved out of the foyer of the lobby.

953
02:54:35,640 --> 02:54:39,062
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm trying to think of others.

954
02:54:41,763 --> 02:54:42,924
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, the bistro does have one.

955
02:54:45,379 --> 02:54:50,051
[SPEAKER_02]: So not necessarily convenient for people who need them, but they are on site.

956
02:54:51,574 --> 02:54:51,935
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

957
02:54:52,817 --> 02:54:53,339
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Branley.

958
02:54:55,618 --> 02:54:58,880
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, well, first, I'd like to thank you for all your hard work on this.

959
02:54:59,100 --> 02:55:00,081
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate it very much.

960
02:55:00,541 --> 02:55:03,743
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, I'd like to thank the custodians who are cleaning the bathrooms.

961
02:55:04,123 --> 02:55:06,404
[SPEAKER_04]: They're definitely unsung heroes on the day-to-day basis.

962
02:55:08,385 --> 02:55:14,489
[SPEAKER_04]: Question, when that plumbing emergency happens, where does that come out of, money-wise?

963
02:55:14,509 --> 02:55:17,531
[SPEAKER_17]: It comes out of facility repairs.

964
02:55:17,711 --> 02:55:18,471
[SPEAKER_04]: Facility repairs.

965
02:55:18,751 --> 02:55:24,675
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, obviously, that's a huge dollar amount that we're not budgeting for.

966
02:55:26,162 --> 02:55:27,283
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm assuming, correct?

967
02:55:27,363 --> 02:55:36,509
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I don't, as much as I budget at home, you know, I had a sink that was clogged for three weeks and it was, you know, impossible and it costs a lot of money.

968
02:55:37,830 --> 02:55:40,312
[SPEAKER_04]: So I can only imagine the depth of that.

969
02:55:40,492 --> 02:55:42,813
[SPEAKER_04]: So that is really disappointing to hear.

970
02:55:43,093 --> 02:55:50,698
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm really curious why boys more than girls, like a girl's throwing this in the trash and boys are just flushing it because it's, I don't know.

971
02:55:50,778 --> 02:55:53,020
[SPEAKER_17]: Girls are not throwing them in the trash from what we know.

972
02:55:54,403 --> 02:55:56,924
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, yeah, that's very interesting to me.

973
02:55:59,905 --> 02:56:07,066
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think it's imperative that we have the bathroom staffed so we can open as many safely as possible.

974
02:56:07,527 --> 02:56:11,508
[SPEAKER_04]: So definitely two staff members looks like it would be helpful.

975
02:56:11,588 --> 02:56:12,528
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you for this.

976
02:56:12,988 --> 02:56:17,449
[SPEAKER_04]: And just really a big thank you to everybody who's cleaning the bathrooms.

977
02:56:18,330 --> 02:56:19,490
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate cleaning my own bathroom.

978
02:56:20,070 --> 02:56:22,651
[SPEAKER_04]: So I can't imagine a bunch of teenage boys.

979
02:56:22,731 --> 02:56:23,671
[SPEAKER_04]: I have one, that's enough.

980
02:56:24,386 --> 02:56:25,087
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you.

981
02:56:26,628 --> 02:56:27,609
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Member Brindley.

982
02:56:28,229 --> 02:56:30,091
[SPEAKER_06]: Cheryl, name and address for the record, please.

983
02:56:37,097 --> 02:56:37,417
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello.

984
02:56:38,358 --> 02:56:40,480
[SPEAKER_01]: Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park Street.

985
02:56:41,961 --> 02:56:42,462
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you hear me?

986
02:56:43,874 --> 02:56:44,774
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we can hear you.

987
02:56:44,794 --> 02:56:47,456
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so.

988
02:56:48,116 --> 02:56:54,158
[SPEAKER_01]: I noticed that the students really weren't considered in this entire presentation, how this is affecting them.

989
02:56:54,218 --> 02:56:56,399
[SPEAKER_01]: It seemed to be more of a logistic thing, but.

990
02:56:56,960 --> 02:57:01,742
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, there's no bathrooms open in the building and we're talking about hiring a staff member.

991
02:57:02,322 --> 02:57:04,203
[SPEAKER_01]: And only being able to open 1 bathroom.

992
02:57:05,396 --> 02:57:11,863
[SPEAKER_01]: Currently, if all the bathrooms on the schedule are open, that's one stall per 100 students.

993
02:57:12,844 --> 02:57:26,558
[SPEAKER_01]: And the students are not all aware of what bathrooms are open, because the office staff isn't even aware of all the office's bathrooms open, because I have called multiple times and asked them what bathrooms are open, and they've told me it's at the discretion of the principal.

994
02:57:27,674 --> 02:57:33,537
[SPEAKER_01]: And I noticed that it was said that the main foyer key bathroom was available to be used.

995
02:57:33,597 --> 02:57:39,140
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I was in the school last week, the security monitor told me that that key had been taken away from him.

996
02:57:39,161 --> 02:57:42,542
[SPEAKER_01]: The student had come and asked for the key, and he said he didn't have the key.

997
02:57:43,503 --> 02:57:52,408
[SPEAKER_01]: So currently, without any bathrooms open in the B building, students are looking at a two to three minute walk from the B building if they have to go to the cafeteria.

998
02:57:53,104 --> 02:58:04,552
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's lunchtime, they're probably gonna be gone for 20 to 30 minutes after they wait in line because the only bathrooms open at lunch, which is also period four, are at the cafeteria.

999
02:58:05,532 --> 02:58:14,038
[SPEAKER_01]: And just last week, my student went and tried to use the bathroom and there were at least six students in each stall vaping.

1000
02:58:14,378 --> 02:58:19,942
[SPEAKER_01]: And they went into the guidance office and asked for the key and were asked why they couldn't use the regular bathroom.

1001
02:58:20,582 --> 02:58:31,250
[SPEAKER_01]: And when they told them that was the first they had heard that there were at least a dozen students in the girls bathroom who were vaping because there was no detector going off.

1002
02:58:31,871 --> 02:58:36,954
[SPEAKER_01]: So currently what we have is students are struggling to find open bathrooms.

1003
02:58:37,295 --> 02:58:40,517
[SPEAKER_01]: When they do find them, they're full of people vaping.

1004
02:58:42,153 --> 02:58:45,998
[SPEAKER_01]: And also the bathrooms are clearly not being monitored now.

1005
02:58:46,078 --> 02:58:53,489
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know why we would need an entire staff person to watch B3 bathroom when the bathrooms that are open now.

1006
02:58:54,033 --> 02:58:59,258
[SPEAKER_01]: are clearly not being monitored and students are not able to use them fully.

1007
02:59:00,258 --> 02:59:07,665
[SPEAKER_01]: Using the bathroom is a human right and we need to consider that these students are people and they should be treated humanely.

1008
02:59:08,185 --> 02:59:18,294
[SPEAKER_01]: This bathroom situation is going on for far too long and I didn't hear any real resolution in that presentation nor acknowledgement of the difficulties that our students are facing in real time.

1009
02:59:18,835 --> 02:59:19,155
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1010
02:59:25,154 --> 02:59:31,576
[SPEAKER_17]: So if I may, I've seen the lobby bathroom open and seen students using it myself.

1011
02:59:33,096 --> 02:59:37,257
[SPEAKER_17]: As I said at the beginning, we understand that this situation is far from perfect.

1012
02:59:38,397 --> 02:59:47,880
[SPEAKER_17]: We wish that as every school leader, and I speak as someone who is unfortunately no longer a school leader, I say that because leading a school is a wonderful thing.

1013
02:59:48,939 --> 02:59:52,560
[SPEAKER_17]: last thing school leaders wanna do is be worrying about bathrooms.

1014
02:59:53,100 --> 02:59:57,781
[SPEAKER_17]: They wanna be worrying about fine arts and curriculum and the curriculum of life, like our driving course.

1015
02:59:57,841 --> 03:00:02,263
[SPEAKER_17]: They wanna worry about the things that are gonna really excite our students and get them.

1016
03:00:02,463 --> 03:00:14,126
[SPEAKER_17]: And every school leader wishes, and you can go to any of the numerous Facebook posts, Facebook pages that are principal pages, and you can see like, oh my God, bathrooms, bathrooms, bathrooms.

1017
03:00:15,100 --> 03:00:18,562
[SPEAKER_17]: It is a fundamental problem that is facing schools.

1018
03:00:19,223 --> 03:00:27,427
[SPEAKER_17]: And as I said at the beginning, I know it is something that our school leaders at the high school wish could be resolved.

1019
03:00:28,048 --> 03:00:34,772
[SPEAKER_17]: Even in the best situation, in a building at 54 years old, there are going to be challenges maintaining all the open bathrooms.

1020
03:00:35,452 --> 03:00:37,654
[SPEAKER_17]: There are bathrooms that at some point

1021
03:00:39,120 --> 03:00:44,764
[SPEAKER_17]: for whatever reason, especially in the B2 area, were converted to storage.

1022
03:00:44,784 --> 03:00:46,926
[SPEAKER_17]: There are no functioning fixtures in some of them.

1023
03:00:47,546 --> 03:00:54,091
[SPEAKER_17]: So really the only B building bathrooms that I know that are functional and able to be opened are on B3.

1024
03:00:55,992 --> 03:01:14,358
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's an unfortunate situation of 54 years in the building, and also facing challenges that are mind-numbing to people trying to focus on academics, building students, building successful citizens.

1025
03:01:15,098 --> 03:01:18,199
[SPEAKER_17]: And I apologize if that's soapbox-ish, but, you know,

1026
03:01:21,283 --> 03:01:34,450
[SPEAKER_17]: I know that our school leadership would rather focus on improving academic outcomes, improving building a better school and a better community for the greater good of Medford, but bathrooms is at the forefront.

1027
03:01:39,173 --> 03:01:39,633
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Graham.

1028
03:01:41,459 --> 03:01:41,779
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1029
03:01:42,859 --> 03:01:58,864
[SPEAKER_11]: Can we make sure that all the people involved who might be responsible for holding a key or fielding a question have clear talking points about how to describe what bathrooms are open at any given time?

1030
03:02:00,139 --> 03:02:02,321
[SPEAKER_11]: It seems to me like I'll call it a training issue.

1031
03:02:02,341 --> 03:02:07,768
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think that's exactly the right word, but there's a communication issue being perpetuated.

1032
03:02:07,828 --> 03:02:10,451
[SPEAKER_11]: That sounds very legitimate and fixable.

1033
03:02:11,613 --> 03:02:16,919
[SPEAKER_11]: If we can make sure that we have some conversation with those key staff so that they

1034
03:02:18,718 --> 03:02:26,240
[SPEAKER_11]: know what's happening day-to-day, first of all, and second of all, if they are supposed to have a key, that they have a key.

1035
03:02:26,320 --> 03:02:44,626
[SPEAKER_11]: I know we have heard lots of things about the re-keying of our buildings from a security standpoint, and I hope that's not what's being sort of perpetuated here, but I just want to make sure that the people who can provide access to students for the bathrooms in that central space know that they are allowed to do that.

1036
03:02:45,026 --> 03:02:51,513
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, so the key is only needed to be asked, but in the main foyer area, I will make sure that he continues to have the key.

1037
03:02:51,593 --> 03:02:57,659
[SPEAKER_13]: My understanding is that he does have the key and that is the only place that a student needs to ask for a key just because of the location.

1038
03:02:58,260 --> 03:03:03,765
[SPEAKER_13]: Secondly, the administrative assistants do know which bathrooms are open on a consistent basis.

1039
03:03:04,406 --> 03:03:05,647
[SPEAKER_13]: I think the

1040
03:03:07,569 --> 03:03:17,716
[SPEAKER_13]: The confusion sometimes when a bathroom is closed, and what we have started to do is either myself or one of the APs, if a bathroom is closed for repairs, we send an email to the students.

1041
03:03:17,756 --> 03:03:22,640
[SPEAKER_13]: We're trying to do that so that the students know so that they're not walking there and then seeing the sign.

1042
03:03:23,440 --> 03:03:33,687
[SPEAKER_13]: That is taking a little bit of coordination to do, but that is something that I have asked my assistant principals to do is to, if there is a bathroom closed, please email.

1043
03:03:34,828 --> 03:03:45,020
[SPEAKER_13]: We just need to make sure that the, the administrative assistants are aware of that as well and I think that that probably hasn't been communicated directly to them when there is a bathroom closed for for repairs.

1044
03:03:45,460 --> 03:03:51,407
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, yeah I think for sure they are some of the most helpful people in your building, and I'm sure they're not.

1045
03:03:53,147 --> 03:03:56,168
[SPEAKER_11]: they're not wanting to not be helpful, right?

1046
03:03:56,288 --> 03:04:10,574
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think we just need to make sure we're giving them the information that they need to be helpful when students are asking them, whether it's the main office or the AP's office or the guidance office, like all of those places are places that I could see students actively going to to say,

1047
03:04:11,514 --> 03:04:12,655
[SPEAKER_11]: where do I go, right?

1048
03:04:13,495 --> 03:04:15,376
[SPEAKER_11]: So that I think is really important as well.

1049
03:04:15,436 --> 03:04:18,357
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you could handle that communication piece, I think that would help.

1050
03:04:19,578 --> 03:04:34,364
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm excited to hear that you have a plan to open bathrooms on the CTE side of the building because that is actually the longest walk you could imagine in the building if you have to go from there to all the way to C. And I'm finally like learning the building, so I'm really proud of myself.

1051
03:04:36,405 --> 03:04:37,545
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't always get lost.

1052
03:04:37,605 --> 03:04:39,046
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like half the time I get lost now.

1053
03:04:39,706 --> 03:04:50,531
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, but, um, I would also like to make a motion to approve the proposal to use the capital funds for the halo vape dispensers, the grout cleaning machine and the cameras.

1054
03:04:52,072 --> 03:04:56,094
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion for approval by Member Graham, seconded by Member Olopade.

1055
03:04:56,194 --> 03:04:56,974
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

1056
03:04:56,994 --> 03:04:57,995
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

1057
03:04:58,175 --> 03:04:58,895
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

1058
03:04:58,935 --> 03:04:59,736
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

1059
03:05:00,716 --> 03:05:03,918
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I would also like to make a motion that you all

1060
03:05:06,141 --> 03:05:17,431
[SPEAKER_11]: put forward for consideration in the supplemental budget what the staffing complement would look like so that that can be an option we consider in the supplemental budget come the first meeting of January.

1061
03:05:20,140 --> 03:05:26,762
[SPEAKER_06]: And before the roll is called, I'm assuming, too, that we're not dependent on these only four vape sensors.

1062
03:05:26,922 --> 03:05:35,305
[SPEAKER_06]: And even if the bathrooms aren't fully monitored or full time, that there's a schedule of who goes and checks what bathroom when.

1063
03:05:35,325 --> 03:05:39,047
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, are there sporadic checks on the bathrooms to make sure there's not

1064
03:05:39,887 --> 03:05:41,187
[SPEAKER_06]: three, four, five kids in a stall.

1065
03:05:41,427 --> 03:05:41,647
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1066
03:05:41,667 --> 03:05:50,730
[SPEAKER_13]: So we consistently have security monitors that are zoned by all of the bathrooms, but also the floor because we can't have the hallways not monitored as well.

1067
03:05:51,010 --> 03:05:54,971
[SPEAKER_13]: So they have a zone that they need to basically circle throughout the day.

1068
03:05:55,031 --> 03:05:57,911
[SPEAKER_13]: We do change it up because if not, that would be very boring on them.

1069
03:05:57,971 --> 03:06:00,152
[SPEAKER_13]: So there's different zones at different times of the day.

1070
03:06:00,592 --> 03:06:03,736
[SPEAKER_13]: as well as all of my assistant principals, as well as myself.

1071
03:06:03,816 --> 03:06:05,598
[SPEAKER_13]: I did about five bathroom checks today.

1072
03:06:05,618 --> 03:06:11,945
[SPEAKER_13]: Anytime we walk by a bathroom, we go in to check it, even if we're going to a meeting or an observation or so forth.

1073
03:06:12,806 --> 03:06:14,628
[SPEAKER_13]: We are trying as hard as we can.

1074
03:06:15,849 --> 03:06:19,874
[SPEAKER_13]: The cameras and making sure that all the cameras are working properly and that we have the correct

1075
03:06:20,054 --> 03:06:27,537
[SPEAKER_13]: angles will be so incredibly helpful because then we can backtrack and be able to see who was in the bathroom, how many students were in the bathroom.

1076
03:06:27,858 --> 03:06:31,619
[SPEAKER_13]: Right now, it's only in some of the bathrooms when we walk in and see it.

1077
03:06:32,460 --> 03:06:36,762
[SPEAKER_13]: So that motion will be very helpful, is helpful.

1078
03:06:37,542 --> 03:06:38,202
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Branley?

1079
03:06:38,362 --> 03:06:40,703
[SPEAKER_04]: Just one question on the angle.

1080
03:06:40,744 --> 03:06:46,066
[SPEAKER_04]: Some areas need more video monitors and then others just need the angle changed?

1081
03:06:47,062 --> 03:06:47,922
[SPEAKER_13]: I think both.

1082
03:06:48,022 --> 03:06:49,203
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not a camera expert.

1083
03:06:49,323 --> 03:06:56,745
[SPEAKER_13]: Neither am I. But I know when I go to see, some of them don't necessarily help, and they only view down one hallway and not the other.

1084
03:06:57,005 --> 03:07:00,887
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, so that seems is that I feel like that's an easy fix, but.

1085
03:07:02,048 --> 03:07:07,650
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm also five feet tall, a little less now, but I can't reach them, but like, how does that happen?

1086
03:07:08,130 --> 03:07:12,492
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, how can we get, can that part be something that's fixed that might not even cost money?

1087
03:07:12,992 --> 03:07:18,994
[SPEAKER_17]: We can, but I'd really reserve any further comments on cameras and other- Yeah, no, I appreciate that too.

1088
03:07:19,934 --> 03:07:21,175
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, motion, oh, it was on the floor.

1089
03:07:21,195 --> 03:07:21,875
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, no, I appreciate that.

1090
03:07:22,135 --> 03:07:23,375
[SPEAKER_06]: Seconded by member Reinfeld.

1091
03:07:23,435 --> 03:07:24,116
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

1092
03:07:24,136 --> 03:07:24,196
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

1093
03:07:25,196 --> 03:07:25,876
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

1094
03:07:25,936 --> 03:07:26,516
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

1095
03:07:26,657 --> 03:07:28,017
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much for the presentation.

1096
03:07:29,483 --> 03:07:35,027
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't have any presentations of the public or continued business, but we do have new business offered by member and topper.

1097
03:07:36,207 --> 03:07:39,930
[SPEAKER_06]: Policy ADF-W-Water Wellness Policy.

1098
03:07:40,670 --> 03:07:46,674
[SPEAKER_06]: The Medford Public Schools is committed to the health, safety, and wellbeing of our students, faculty, staff, and community partners.

1099
03:07:47,255 --> 03:07:53,099
[SPEAKER_06]: In doing so, the Medford Public Schools commits to providing safe drinking water for consumption district-wide.

1100
03:07:53,159 --> 03:07:56,761
[SPEAKER_06]: To ensure safe water, the following testing frequency will occur.

1101
03:07:56,901 --> 03:07:58,302
[SPEAKER_06]: Water testing for all non-drinking

1102
03:07:58,772 --> 03:08:16,230
[SPEAKER_06]: Intended fixtures, bathroom sinks, slop sinks, outdoor fixtures will occur every four calendar years to ensure that action level demands are met for lead proper levels, water testing for all drinking intended fixtures, kitchen sinks, classroom sinks, water fountains, water filtration, filter systems, stations.

1103
03:08:16,710 --> 03:08:21,372
[SPEAKER_06]: will take place every two calendar years to ensure the action level demands are met for lead copper levels.

1104
03:08:22,052 --> 03:08:22,672
[SPEAKER_06]: Action levels.

1105
03:08:22,732 --> 03:08:31,275
[SPEAKER_06]: The action levels per 310CMR22, the Massachusetts drinking water regulations are defined as follows for each metal.

1106
03:08:31,635 --> 03:08:38,598
[SPEAKER_06]: And the presence of lead results in the range of 1 to 15 ppb and or equal to or greater than 15 ppb.

1107
03:08:40,278 --> 03:08:49,261
[SPEAKER_06]: The Medford Public Schools will conduct water testing of all fixtures in said building at least twice a singular calendar year until all results yield 1 ppb.

1108
03:08:49,481 --> 03:08:53,803
[SPEAKER_06]: Testing will continue at this frequency for an additional year to ensure safety needs are met.

1109
03:08:54,903 --> 03:09:05,867
[SPEAKER_06]: In the presence of copper results equal to greater than 1300 ppb, the Medford Public Schools will conduct water testing of all fixtures in said building at least twice a singular calendar year until all results yielded.

1110
03:09:07,799 --> 03:09:12,204
[SPEAKER_06]: Testing will continue at this frequency for an additional year to ensure safety needs are met.

1111
03:09:16,869 --> 03:09:17,669
[SPEAKER_06]: Action plan.

1112
03:09:20,673 --> 03:09:21,854
[SPEAKER_06]: If the action levels are met.

1113
03:09:22,622 --> 03:09:24,744
[SPEAKER_06]: per 310 CMR 22.

1114
03:09:24,804 --> 03:09:32,090
[SPEAKER_06]: The following procedures must be met by the administration and building staff in the presence of lead results in the range of one to 15 ppb.

1115
03:09:32,510 --> 03:09:40,737
[SPEAKER_06]: Hand washing only signs must be posted at each impacted fixture in the presence of lead results equal to or greater than 15 ppb.

1116
03:09:40,817 --> 03:09:45,841
[SPEAKER_06]: The fixture must be disabled and signage must be posted at each impacted fixture.

1117
03:09:46,641 --> 03:09:47,222
[SPEAKER_06]: The presence

1118
03:09:49,437 --> 03:09:57,002
[SPEAKER_06]: of copper results equal to or greater than 1300 PVV, the fixture must be disabled and signage must be posted at each impacted fixture.

1119
03:09:57,583 --> 03:10:06,629
[SPEAKER_06]: All action plan items must be communicated and executed in the impacted communities of the impacted building no later than 36 hours after this discovery of said results.

1120
03:10:07,450 --> 03:10:08,090
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Ntapa.

1121
03:10:11,193 --> 03:10:11,453
[SPEAKER_18]: Sure.

1122
03:10:11,673 --> 03:10:12,353
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mayor.

1123
03:10:14,485 --> 03:10:19,166
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it goes without saying why this is on the agenda and why this is being proposed.

1124
03:10:20,306 --> 03:10:29,788
[SPEAKER_18]: A lot of what this does is it affirms the actions we have taken to the ongoing incident with the lead being discovered in our school buildings.

1125
03:10:30,968 --> 03:10:38,030
[SPEAKER_18]: And it takes the recommendations of the MWRA and the state of Massachusetts, as well as some federal guidelines and determinations of

1126
03:10:38,703 --> 03:10:46,865
[SPEAKER_18]: frequency of testing, what happens if we identify that there is presence of said metals in the buildings.

1127
03:10:47,305 --> 03:10:58,807
[SPEAKER_18]: I will say just for point of clarification in the policy reading, the policy states for in the presence of lead results in the range of one to less than 15 ppb.

1128
03:10:59,007 --> 03:11:05,408
[SPEAKER_18]: And then there is there is a less than sign just to that just is mainly also for the copper level because there

1129
03:11:06,198 --> 03:11:07,959
[SPEAKER_18]: wasn't an identifiable range.

1130
03:11:08,540 --> 03:11:12,223
[SPEAKER_18]: Obviously, the pipes are made of copper.

1131
03:11:12,263 --> 03:11:17,707
[SPEAKER_18]: It's more of like one that starts to really, really leak into the water, usually due to age, if I'm not mistaken.

1132
03:11:20,389 --> 03:11:24,393
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's just a matter of making sure that once it hits 1,300, that's when they need to be disabled.

1133
03:11:24,413 --> 03:11:27,415
[SPEAKER_18]: And there wasn't really like a safe, like, oh, it's hand washing only.

1134
03:11:27,455 --> 03:11:30,417
[SPEAKER_18]: I couldn't find that anywhere, which is why it's a little less detailed.

1135
03:11:31,538 --> 03:11:32,119
[SPEAKER_18]: But this is to,

1136
03:11:34,349 --> 03:11:49,033
[SPEAKER_18]: reaffirm our commitment to making sure our community is informed, to making sure that it is clear the action to take when this is discovered, and how long we should be really kicking it into gear.

1137
03:11:51,333 --> 03:11:53,234
[SPEAKER_18]: But I don't think I really have any further comments.

1138
03:11:53,314 --> 03:11:56,275
[SPEAKER_18]: I welcome as many questions as there are.

1139
03:11:56,715 --> 03:11:57,555
[SPEAKER_06]: If I may, through the chair,

1140
03:11:58,567 --> 03:12:00,587
[SPEAKER_06]: Where did you get these standards?

1141
03:12:00,607 --> 03:12:15,190
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I do know a lot of this is relevant to the hand washing only signs, but removal of fixtures, did you get this somewhere specific?

1142
03:12:15,350 --> 03:12:26,572
[SPEAKER_06]: Just because if it's safe to wash your hands after you run the water for 30 seconds, why would we remove the fixtures and test twice a year?

1143
03:12:28,510 --> 03:12:32,072
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't, maybe, hold on.

1144
03:12:32,473 --> 03:12:34,594
[SPEAKER_06]: The fixture must be disabled, so.

1145
03:12:34,894 --> 03:12:48,123
[SPEAKER_18]: It's just disabled as in like it cannot, that was following the guidance of what we followed through our testing and through what we've been doing, where if it was above 15 parts per billion, the fixture was disabled until we could figure out a cause.

1146
03:12:48,323 --> 03:12:51,385
[SPEAKER_18]: And so it's not, it's removed, not physically.

1147
03:12:51,405 --> 03:12:55,988
[SPEAKER_18]: And that, if that, maybe I'm misunderstanding the phrasing.

1148
03:12:56,708 --> 03:13:01,733
[SPEAKER_18]: But the idea was that that was way too high of a level of lead and that it could not be used.

1149
03:13:02,353 --> 03:13:13,403
[SPEAKER_18]: And that furthers the philosophy that we've been using of we want to make sure that even if flushing is available, we cannot be certain that that is happening at an adequate time.

1150
03:13:13,423 --> 03:13:15,905
[SPEAKER_18]: And we need to just take proper action.

1151
03:13:17,166 --> 03:13:20,989
[SPEAKER_18]: So that is following the philosophy of what we are currently doing.

1152
03:13:23,399 --> 03:13:24,660
[SPEAKER_18]: And that is a concern of mine.

1153
03:13:24,680 --> 03:13:31,683
[SPEAKER_18]: And I agree with that philosophy of, even if it's flushing, like, let's just get it down until we can figure out the best way to do it.

1154
03:13:31,743 --> 03:13:43,088
[SPEAKER_18]: Because it's not even like a comment of, there's no good faith that people don't know how to time it or people know how to do it, but it's just not giving the opportunity for that to possibly happen.

1155
03:13:43,108 --> 03:13:48,831
[SPEAKER_18]: And I hope that clarifies the understanding.

1156
03:13:52,082 --> 03:13:54,204
[SPEAKER_06]: And you got this language from the MWRA?

1157
03:13:54,865 --> 03:13:57,047
[SPEAKER_18]: The ranges were through the MWRA.

1158
03:13:57,547 --> 03:14:16,845
[SPEAKER_18]: And then it was mainly to reaffirm the ranges with the MWRA as well as, so according to the 310CMR2, the Massachusetts drinking water regulations as well as what we have been doing with the recommendation from UMass Amherst and MassDEP.

1159
03:14:21,397 --> 03:14:21,977
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Rousseau.

1160
03:14:26,941 --> 03:14:27,322
[SPEAKER_14]: There it is.

1161
03:14:27,822 --> 03:14:28,222
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1162
03:14:28,242 --> 03:14:32,866
[SPEAKER_14]: I had something to say.

1163
03:14:33,106 --> 03:14:34,627
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, it's getting late.

1164
03:14:35,328 --> 03:14:48,998
[SPEAKER_14]: I won't do this right now, but I think that if we were all forced to just decide what 30 seconds was, we would all discover that most of us are wrong.

1165
03:14:50,727 --> 03:14:56,290
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think that when safety is at issue, I think that that is acceptable.

1166
03:14:56,310 --> 03:15:00,213
[SPEAKER_14]: That's just not a high enough bar.

1167
03:15:00,673 --> 03:15:07,918
[SPEAKER_14]: Just flush it for 30 seconds doesn't, I mean, there's not a giant clock in front of every sink with a second hand going.

1168
03:15:08,738 --> 03:15:10,680
[SPEAKER_14]: So you know what 30 seconds is.

1169
03:15:11,600 --> 03:15:15,022
[SPEAKER_14]: You go to the dentist, they do all these things that have timers everywhere.

1170
03:15:15,243 --> 03:15:15,503
[SPEAKER_14]: Why?

1171
03:15:15,583 --> 03:15:18,925
[SPEAKER_14]: Because nobody knows exactly what 30 seconds is or 90 seconds

1172
03:15:19,451 --> 03:15:25,735
[SPEAKER_14]: So I agree that we should not be relying on that flush recommendation.

1173
03:15:25,755 --> 03:15:31,780
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'd like to make a motion to approve the first reading.

1174
03:15:31,800 --> 03:15:45,129
[SPEAKER_17]: I remember during our presentation,

1175
03:15:47,572 --> 03:16:00,821
[SPEAKER_17]: from Alex from the state organization that they said that the 15 parts per billion was being reduced to 10 parts per billion by the EPA and legislation upcoming.

1176
03:16:01,321 --> 03:16:06,245
[SPEAKER_17]: I just want to put that out there because I know it's 15 in here.

1177
03:16:06,265 --> 03:16:09,006
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know if 10 is the right target.

1178
03:16:16,411 --> 03:16:16,631
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1179
03:16:16,651 --> 03:16:19,132
[SPEAKER_14]: Um I'd like to amend my, um.

1180
03:16:21,133 --> 03:16:27,015
[SPEAKER_14]: Approve my motion to approve the first reading by changing the frequency of review from four years to one year.

1181
03:16:27,035 --> 03:16:36,759
[SPEAKER_14]: Assuming it's okay with

1182
03:16:54,353 --> 03:16:54,593
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1183
03:16:55,594 --> 03:16:55,794
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

1184
03:16:56,415 --> 03:17:00,759
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, I just to clarify, I was just changing the frequency of policy review.

1185
03:17:01,780 --> 03:17:02,160
[SPEAKER_14]: That's all.

1186
03:17:04,502 --> 03:17:16,373
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, motion for approval.

1187
03:17:25,458 --> 03:17:26,338
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion for approval.

1188
03:17:26,358 --> 03:17:35,102
[SPEAKER_06]: And Dr. Cushing, do you feel that this policy is doable?

1189
03:17:35,162 --> 03:17:41,004
[SPEAKER_06]: And do we know if this is how it's handled in most school districts?

1190
03:17:42,705 --> 03:17:48,207
[SPEAKER_17]: I honestly can't say in most school districts because it has never fallen into the academic realm that I'm used to.

1191
03:17:48,687 --> 03:17:51,768
[SPEAKER_17]: However, I can definitely look into it.

1192
03:17:53,908 --> 03:17:55,709
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, I think it's doable for a first reading.

1193
03:17:56,350 --> 03:18:07,096
[SPEAKER_17]: And, you know, I also, as a matter of practice, I've always felt that policies are great to at least have a run through the policy subcommittee.

1194
03:18:08,177 --> 03:18:11,899
[SPEAKER_17]: But, you know, it's an important policy.

1195
03:18:11,939 --> 03:18:12,179
[SPEAKER_17]: It is.

1196
03:18:13,220 --> 03:18:13,440
[SPEAKER_14]: Mayor?

1197
03:18:14,241 --> 03:18:14,521
[SPEAKER_06]: Mabruso?

1198
03:18:15,289 --> 03:18:18,571
[SPEAKER_14]: I did look to see if other school committees have a policy on this.

1199
03:18:18,611 --> 03:18:22,274
[SPEAKER_14]: There were two school committees that did, don't ask me which ones they were.

1200
03:18:23,695 --> 03:18:29,698
[SPEAKER_14]: And one of them was very vague, like, you know, we'll have safe drinking water.

1201
03:18:29,718 --> 03:18:31,159
[SPEAKER_14]: Ooh.

1202
03:18:32,380 --> 03:18:37,423
[SPEAKER_14]: And the other one, sorry, it was a very unenforceable policy, so I just thought it was interesting.

1203
03:18:37,783 --> 03:18:40,985
[SPEAKER_14]: But the other one was actually far more restrictive.

1204
03:18:41,066 --> 03:18:43,207
[SPEAKER_14]: It was like every year, every fixture,

1205
03:18:45,564 --> 03:18:56,308
[SPEAKER_14]: And I did wonder greatly what on earth they're spending on that or if they're really doing it, but I didn't spend more time on it than that.

1206
03:18:56,588 --> 03:19:05,531
[SPEAKER_14]: So there were only two of all of the 349 communities in the school committee manual in Massachusetts that even had anything.

1207
03:19:06,494 --> 03:19:16,279
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, so I my guess is most just assume that this is being handled already by the Department of Public Works or Or border health or something.

1208
03:19:16,519 --> 03:19:18,720
[SPEAKER_14]: But we did that as well.

1209
03:19:18,860 --> 03:19:21,701
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's why I support this.

1210
03:19:22,041 --> 03:19:22,361
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1211
03:19:24,442 --> 03:19:25,423
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember in Tapa.

1212
03:19:31,275 --> 03:19:59,570
[SPEAKER_18]: And if I may, that is why I really appreciate the, and it was, it crossed my mind as writing the policy to put the frequency to a year just to see, I have a hope and a feeling that we will not have to go into that realm of testing everyone twice a calendar year if it's lead detected after we fix and solve the issue that is happening within our schools now.

1213
03:20:00,631 --> 03:20:04,493
[SPEAKER_18]: because those are a lot of areas impacted.

1214
03:20:04,813 --> 03:20:25,560
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm hoping that once that is fixed, we won't have to go into the realm of doing it every year, once a year, as stated in the policy, which is why also they're separated between two and four of the priority of really making sure ones that we are consuming are being tested.

1215
03:20:25,950 --> 03:20:31,976
[SPEAKER_18]: And that range comes from also, I believe was the MWR's range of three to five years for just testing in general.

1216
03:20:33,317 --> 03:20:36,500
[SPEAKER_18]: And so around the side of caution of doing two and four.

1217
03:20:38,722 --> 03:20:51,494
[SPEAKER_18]: So I appreciate that, because again, if we find that we do not simply have the people power or the funds to do this at this frequency, we at least know that we've done our part to help fix the issue we have now.

1218
03:20:52,392 --> 03:20:56,573
[SPEAKER_18]: And then we can revisit it and figure out what the problem is and how to amend that.

1219
03:20:57,573 --> 03:21:02,574
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and I just don't want to set somebody up for failure, whoever has to take this project on.

1220
03:21:02,654 --> 03:21:03,174
[SPEAKER_18]: No, 100%.

1221
03:21:03,835 --> 03:21:06,155
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we don't know what the problem is yet.

1222
03:21:06,175 --> 03:21:07,955
[SPEAKER_06]: We're looking into it.

1223
03:21:08,215 --> 03:21:08,616
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

1224
03:21:08,656 --> 03:21:12,396
[SPEAKER_06]: We've ordered new fixtures to see if it is fixtures.

1225
03:21:12,416 --> 03:21:15,517
[SPEAKER_18]: To me, if I may, Mayor, the part of the

1226
03:21:20,572 --> 03:21:23,793
[SPEAKER_18]: policy where it says what the plan is has already been started.

1227
03:21:24,773 --> 03:21:34,815
[SPEAKER_18]: So to me, this is the start of that two-year cycle of we've already done all the testing.

1228
03:21:34,835 --> 03:21:38,356
[SPEAKER_18]: So if the policy is enacted, we are already within that cycle.

1229
03:21:38,396 --> 03:21:40,817
[SPEAKER_18]: So we now have two years to retest.

1230
03:21:41,157 --> 03:21:42,317
[SPEAKER_18]: That's when that started.

1231
03:21:42,937 --> 03:21:45,178
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think that that is a comfortable date to start.

1232
03:21:46,167 --> 03:21:46,787
[SPEAKER_18]: because we did it.

1233
03:21:47,287 --> 03:21:48,048
[SPEAKER_18]: We tested them all.

1234
03:21:48,068 --> 03:21:56,410
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to have to keep testing them to make sure that our solutions are permanent solutions, that we didn't just fix a small issue, that we actually got down to the root of the problem.

1235
03:21:56,530 --> 03:21:57,331
[SPEAKER_18]: We figured it out.

1236
03:21:57,591 --> 03:21:57,831
[SPEAKER_18]: Good.

1237
03:21:59,711 --> 03:22:02,852
[SPEAKER_18]: But in my eyes, that two-year calendar has started.

1238
03:22:02,872 --> 03:22:07,334
[SPEAKER_18]: And if we have to push it to be in two more years when it gets like that's when it officially gets, whatever.

1239
03:22:07,614 --> 03:22:09,535
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't understand the logistics of that quite yet.

1240
03:22:09,715 --> 03:22:13,796
[SPEAKER_18]: But to clarify that, that is my thought process with it.

1241
03:22:15,188 --> 03:22:15,628
[SPEAKER_18]: So thank you.

1242
03:22:16,169 --> 03:22:16,810
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Reinfeldt.

1243
03:22:20,012 --> 03:22:24,617
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to know either at the second reading or as a result of the investigation, just who

1244
03:22:26,238 --> 03:22:34,982
[SPEAKER_02]: where the responsibility is going to lie for doing that testing because this most recent round of testing obviously was through the program that we are now no longer eligible for.

1245
03:22:35,002 --> 03:22:44,267
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we're eligible for the grants to update the drinking stations, but we can't, we won't be having the state come in and do this testing to the level that we did.

1246
03:22:44,347 --> 03:22:46,128
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't need it codified, but I would like it.

1247
03:22:46,588 --> 03:22:53,091
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to know who's going, where that responsibility will lie, but I will second the motion to approve the first reading on this.

1248
03:22:56,101 --> 03:22:57,422
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it was?

1249
03:22:57,742 --> 03:22:58,003
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1250
03:22:59,544 --> 03:23:00,204
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

1251
03:23:01,706 --> 03:23:02,406
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

1252
03:23:03,567 --> 03:23:04,188
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

1253
03:23:07,401 --> 03:23:18,044
[SPEAKER_06]: Condolences, members of the Medford School Committee express their sincere condolences to the family of Rita A. Muzuru, former administrative assistant for the Medford Public Schools.

1254
03:23:19,324 --> 03:23:32,648
[SPEAKER_06]: Members of the Medford School Committee express their sincere condolences to the family of Mary Margaret Marge McKinton, who was the administrative assistant to the principal of Medford High School for 31 years, and also known as the school mom.

1255
03:23:33,848 --> 03:23:35,849
[SPEAKER_06]: If we all may rise for a moment of silence, please.

1256
03:23:46,425 --> 03:23:46,765
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1257
03:23:47,806 --> 03:23:55,191
[SPEAKER_06]: Our next regular meeting will be December 16, 2024 here in the Alden Memorial Chambers, Medford City Hall, in addition to Zoom.

1258
03:23:55,211 --> 03:23:58,313
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a motion on the floor to adjourn?
