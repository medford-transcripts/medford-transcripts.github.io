27
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:11,871
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's just missing spring.

28
00:01:14,192 --> 00:01:16,494
[SPEAKER_06]: It's on page two, community participation.

29
00:01:17,575 --> 00:01:21,958

[SPEAKER_03]: Van der Kloot.

39
00:01:38,312 --> 00:01:39,193
[SPEAKER_06]: I just have a question.

40
00:01:40,555 --> 00:01:44,539
[SPEAKER_06]: There was just a couple of items that were unclassified.

41
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:45,980
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

42
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,441
[SPEAKER_06]: It was on page two.

43
00:01:48,482 --> 00:01:50,765
[SPEAKER_06]: Equipment, other, BMCA 2006-25.

44
00:01:55,226 --> 00:01:56,027
[SPEAKER_06]: I can recognize that.

45
00:01:56,708 --> 00:01:57,348
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, good evening.

46
00:01:57,388 --> 00:01:59,290
[SPEAKER_17]: So that is for a food service program.

47
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,171
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

48
00:02:00,852 --> 00:02:10,602
[SPEAKER_06]: And then on page four, Bill and Associates had four items that were just on other supplies.

49
00:02:11,043 --> 00:02:12,785
[SPEAKER_06]: That's for the pool, pool supplies.

50
00:02:12,905 --> 00:02:13,706
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, thank you.

00:02:24,207 --> 00:02:32,631

00:02:50,178 --> 00:02:50,398
Yes.

59
00:02:52,779 --> 00:02:52,979
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

60
00:02:53,877 --> 00:02:56,681
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

61
00:02:56,701 --> 00:03:00,906
[SPEAKER_03]: Approval of the bills and payrolls passed.

62
00:03:04,295 --> 00:03:05,315
[SPEAKER_03]: Reports of Secretary.

63
00:03:05,775 --> 00:03:06,795
[SPEAKER_15]: Just one quick thing.

64
00:03:06,996 --> 00:03:10,216
[SPEAKER_15]: I started signing the bills last Wednesday.

65
00:03:11,176 --> 00:03:15,377
[SPEAKER_15]: It's going to be my custom to sign them on Wednesday morning at the high school.

66
00:03:15,457 --> 00:03:18,738
[SPEAKER_15]: About 10 o'clock will be what I'm expecting.

67
00:03:19,538 --> 00:03:22,779
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd like to invite my colleagues to come and join me.

68
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:26,679
[SPEAKER_15]: If you're available Wednesday, that's great.

69
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,100
[SPEAKER_15]: If you're not, we can do it some other time.

70
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,121
[SPEAKER_15]: If you want to just drop in at any point.

71
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:36,985
[SPEAKER_15]: Some weeks are heavier than other weeks, so you never know in advance.

72
00:03:37,686 --> 00:03:43,190
[SPEAKER_15]: But please, if you would like to join me this Wednesday, let me know, just so I have a heads up.

73
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:47,693
[SPEAKER_15]: But I certainly think it's a valuable experience, so please do so when you can.

74
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:49,135
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

75
00:03:52,337 --> 00:03:54,359
[SPEAKER_03]: And number four, report of secretary.

76
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:56,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there anything else?

77
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,361
[SPEAKER_02]: That was it.

78
00:03:59,618 --> 00:04:00,899
[SPEAKER_03]: Report of committees.

79
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:02,740
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we have any reports?

80
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:03,500
[SPEAKER_03]: None.

81
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:04,680
[SPEAKER_03]: No reports.

82
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:06,321
[SPEAKER_03]: Community participation.

83
00:04:12,144 --> 00:04:15,105
[SPEAKER_03]: Next we have number seven, report of superintendent.

84
00:04:21,148 --> 00:04:22,248
[SPEAKER_10]: Madam Superintendent.

85
00:04:23,649 --> 00:04:24,189
[SPEAKER_10]: Good evening.

86
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:28,271
[SPEAKER_10]: I did not have the opportunity last week

87
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:32,316
[SPEAKER_10]: but I do hope that everyone had a peaceful and joyous holiday.

88
00:04:33,236 --> 00:04:41,098
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, I wanted to personally welcome Mayor Lungo-Koehn, Melanie McLaughlin, and Jenny Graham to the school committee.

89
00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:45,439
[SPEAKER_10]: The inaugural celebration was a joyous one.

90
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:55,382
[SPEAKER_10]: We look forward to an ambitious and exciting year as we work together to provide the very best education for all of the children of our community.

91
00:04:57,257 --> 00:05:00,399
[SPEAKER_10]: My mantra has been, one Medford, one district.

92
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:06,124
[SPEAKER_10]: We are stronger when we work together to improve the quality of life for all in Medford.

93
00:05:08,385 --> 00:05:16,631
[SPEAKER_10]: With my father's passing, I appreciate Associate Superintendent Diane Caldwell for handling last week's school committee meeting for me.

94
00:05:17,352 --> 00:05:23,696
[SPEAKER_10]: In addition, I appreciate all of those who have expressed their sympathies to me and my family.

95
00:05:24,437 --> 00:05:25,798
[SPEAKER_10]: He was my biggest supporter.

96
00:05:26,355 --> 00:05:27,736
[SPEAKER_10]: and he will sorely be missed.

97
00:05:29,917 --> 00:05:42,985
[SPEAKER_10]: Please note that in case of inclement weather coming up, our team is currently working diligently on putting together a policy to possibly utilize a two hour delay.

98
00:05:44,766 --> 00:05:53,792
[SPEAKER_10]: The bus schedule would have to be realigned as well as principals must realign their classroom schedules in order for this to work.

99
00:05:54,823 --> 00:06:08,673
[SPEAKER_10]: Most importantly, we have to also continue to work closely with the Department of Public Works to make sure that they're able to clear the parking lots and sidewalks surrounding the schools on time.

100
00:06:10,003 --> 00:06:22,578
[SPEAKER_10]: Obviously, safety is our top priority, so we intend to meet with all parties and see if this is an option that could work for us in lieu of having to cancel school outright.

101
00:06:23,059 --> 00:06:27,003
[SPEAKER_10]: So we are trying to come up with a happy medium.

102
00:06:30,278 --> 00:06:36,483
[SPEAKER_10]: Additionally, graduation for the class of 2020, it is fast approaching, June of 2020.

103
00:06:38,084 --> 00:06:53,737
[SPEAKER_10]: Seniors will need to order their caps and gowns on the following dates, this week, Wednesday, January 15th, and Thursday, January 16th, and or next week, Wednesday, January 22nd, or Thursday, January 23rd.

104
00:06:55,593 --> 00:07:02,800
[SPEAKER_10]: Orders will take place outside of the gym on both dates, and the cost is $20 per student.

105
00:07:03,341 --> 00:07:08,006
[SPEAKER_10]: So cash or checks only, and checks should be payable to cap and gown.

106
00:07:09,547 --> 00:07:10,788
[SPEAKER_10]: Upcoming key events.

107
00:07:11,769 --> 00:07:15,233
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a listening, this is for the listening audience.

108
00:07:17,533 --> 00:07:31,364
[SPEAKER_10]: I want you all to know that during the month of February at our upcoming meetings, we'll be making announcements about the middle school lottery process for students starting sixth grade in August of 2020.

109
00:07:33,145 --> 00:07:40,828
[SPEAKER_10]: Additionally, Building Bridges to Kindergarten information sessions will also be coming up and we'll have a presentation on that.

110
00:07:41,548 --> 00:07:49,451
[SPEAKER_10]: At those Building Bridges to Kindergarten sessions, we encourage families to attend one of three informational sessions.

111
00:07:49,931 --> 00:07:58,902
[SPEAKER_10]: And at those sessions, they have an opportunity to hear from our nursing department, representatives from the Parent Information Center, PIC.

112
00:07:59,663 --> 00:08:02,927
[SPEAKER_10]: We will also have interpreters available if needed.

113
00:08:03,788 --> 00:08:06,311
[SPEAKER_10]: And they will learn about the registration process.

114
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:09,655
[SPEAKER_10]: So that is upcoming information for our February meetings.

115
00:08:11,022 --> 00:08:21,273
[SPEAKER_10]: So I want the community to rest assured that you are not late, that there's no need to be concerned about upcoming deadlines because you haven't missed anything yet.

116
00:08:23,098 --> 00:08:26,641
[SPEAKER_10]: So I also want to share some good news about our former Mustangs.

117
00:08:27,622 --> 00:08:35,708
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's nice to see so many Mustangs coming back and continuing to contribute to the success of Medford Public Schools.

118
00:08:36,569 --> 00:08:39,992
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd like to recognize Lou Mandarini of Local 22.

119
00:08:41,653 --> 00:08:51,787
[SPEAKER_10]: He went shopping right before the holidays with students from the vocational side of the house construction craft labors program in collaboration with the rotary.

120
00:08:51,807 --> 00:08:53,969
[SPEAKER_10]: And they made.

121
00:08:56,263 --> 00:08:59,425
[SPEAKER_10]: holiday food baskets for families in Medford.

122
00:09:00,146 --> 00:09:07,151
[SPEAKER_10]: And Local 22 donated $1,400 worth of food products for this cause.

123
00:09:07,731 --> 00:09:15,036
[SPEAKER_10]: And so in collaboration with our vocational students, donating over 2,000 non-perishable food items.

124
00:09:15,556 --> 00:09:21,541
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just wanted to recognize their hard work and their commitment to giving back to the community.

125
00:09:22,081 --> 00:09:24,563
[SPEAKER_10]: And so over 200 Medford families

126
00:09:25,123 --> 00:09:33,633
[SPEAKER_10]: were able to have received these holiday baskets and nonperishable food items.

127
00:09:33,653 --> 00:09:41,401
[SPEAKER_10]: So I was really happy about that and very proud of the work that's happening with students participating in community service.

128
00:09:42,605 --> 00:09:59,993
[SPEAKER_10]: Additionally, Dave McGilvery, in November and December, Mr. McGilvery, who was a Boston Marathon director, he spoke at both middle schools, talking to our middle school students, motivating them, and encouraging them to always chase their dreams.

129
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:10,235
[SPEAKER_10]: Additionally, he was also one of the inaugural speakers last week at our legendary Chevalier Theater, and he also spoke.

130
00:10:10,315 --> 00:10:27,019
[SPEAKER_10]: So he's a wonderful speaker, and again, as I am a new Mustang, clearly, once a Mustang, always a Mustang, and we appreciate graduates taking the time out of their busy schedules to enhance opportunities for the greater Medford community.

131
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:38,613
[SPEAKER_10]: I also wanna just share with you that yesterday, I had the opportunity to be the guest speaker at the Japanese Association of Greater Boston.

132
00:10:39,913 --> 00:10:42,394
[SPEAKER_10]: They were celebrating the Japanese New Year for 2020.

133
00:10:43,714 --> 00:10:46,595
[SPEAKER_10]: It took place in Arlington at their town hall.

134
00:10:47,195 --> 00:10:50,936
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm gonna ask you to bear with me.

135
00:10:51,476 --> 00:10:55,417
[SPEAKER_10]: I may make a few errors, but I'm gonna just try to share a small snippet with you.

136
00:10:57,294 --> 00:11:03,273
[SPEAKER_10]: Akemashite omedetou gozaimasu, which means happy new year in Japanese.

137
00:11:05,217 --> 00:11:15,243
[SPEAKER_10]: But for those of you who may not be aware, since 1980, Medford has a sister city in Japan, and the sister city in Japan is Nobeoka.

138
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:23,068
[SPEAKER_10]: Additionally, part of the Japanese tradition, they celebrate Bonninkai parties.

139
00:11:23,668 --> 00:11:26,910
[SPEAKER_10]: And a Bonninkai party is a year-forgetting party.

140
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:31,793
[SPEAKER_10]: Its purpose is to leave the old year's worries and troubles behind.

141
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:39,578
[SPEAKER_10]: Additionally, I learned about ikigai, and ikigai means your purpose in life.

142
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:55,370
[SPEAKER_10]: It's something we should all pay more attention to, for it teaches to accept people as they are, urges us to step away from our often over-scheduled lives, and suggests that we all live in the moment.

143
00:11:56,050 --> 00:12:02,115
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just wanted to say ikigai to all of you, and I'm glad to be back.

144
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:03,635
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

145
00:12:04,496 --> 00:12:05,216
[SPEAKER_03]: We're glad you're back.

146
00:12:07,797 --> 00:12:09,158
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Superintendent.

147
00:12:09,218 --> 00:12:15,940
[SPEAKER_03]: Second, we have proposed meeting dates for Budget Committee of the Whole, Fiscal Year 21, given to us by Ms.

148
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,001
[SPEAKER_03]: Christine Patterson.

149
00:12:23,283 --> 00:12:23,463
[SPEAKER_17]: Ms.

150
00:12:23,483 --> 00:12:23,803
[SPEAKER_17]: Patterson.

151
00:12:24,163 --> 00:12:24,543
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

152
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:33,346
[SPEAKER_17]: This is just the tentative draft listing for the proposed meeting dates and times.

153
00:12:33,426 --> 00:12:38,211
[SPEAKER_17]: These are before all of the regularly scheduled school committee meetings.

154
00:12:38,771 --> 00:12:45,337
[SPEAKER_17]: I believe that was the suggested days for this type of budget hearing.

155
00:12:45,818 --> 00:12:47,459
[SPEAKER_17]: We have them scheduled for 530.

156
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,962
[SPEAKER_17]: Again, the location and method on how we

157
00:12:51,863 --> 00:12:57,667
[SPEAKER_17]: send these meetings out to the community is per your discretion.

158
00:12:58,008 --> 00:13:02,331
[SPEAKER_17]: And again, these will be publicly posted meetings once approved on the schedule.

159
00:13:02,811 --> 00:13:09,936
[SPEAKER_17]: I will note that this schedule starts much sooner than we did last year.

160
00:13:10,517 --> 00:13:16,141
[SPEAKER_17]: We have quite a bit of area to cover and we did provide for a

161
00:13:17,548 --> 00:13:31,953
[SPEAKER_17]: extended schedule in order to dive in a little bit further, if you will, for some of the areas that had additional questions or might not have felt there was enough time from the last year as we went through this process.

162
00:13:32,413 --> 00:13:36,535
[SPEAKER_17]: It is a very inclusive process and open to the public.

163
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:43,557
[SPEAKER_17]: And again, we would be covering the areas on the dates that are before you as a proposed list.

164
00:13:46,912 --> 00:13:47,252
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

165
00:13:52,714 --> 00:13:53,634
[SPEAKER_06]: School committee woman, Kreatz.

166
00:13:53,994 --> 00:13:54,734
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

167
00:13:55,414 --> 00:14:13,579
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted to know, because we had talked about it, Erin DiBenedetto, she was a former school committee member, she had motioned last year at the end of the presentations that we were going to record the pre-budget meetings, because there were so many people that didn't know we even had the meetings.

168
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:15,880
[SPEAKER_06]: So I wanted to make a motion to

169
00:14:17,116 --> 00:14:21,700
[SPEAKER_06]: record the pre-budget meetings that we're going to have in room 207.

170
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:27,725
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, making sure and ensuring that the recording equipment is turned off at the end of our Committee of the Whole meeting.

171
00:14:27,745 --> 00:14:35,332
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that Vice Chair Russo sent us a message last week sharing some details about

172
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:40,763
[SPEAKER_06]: another community that had their recording equipment kept on during their executive session.

173
00:14:41,823 --> 00:14:43,965
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm not sure how we go about doing that.

174
00:14:44,005 --> 00:14:58,633
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know who controls turning it on, but I did talk to City Councilor Riccariello yesterday, and all of their pre-budget meetings are recorded in room 207 when they have their pre-budget meetings.

175
00:14:59,096 --> 00:15:06,019
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just wanted to reiterate that and for transparency so that everybody's welcome to attend.

176
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:10,962
[SPEAKER_06]: Even if they can't get there, they could watch from home or at their convenience.

177
00:15:12,102 --> 00:15:13,903
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that something that we're going to definitely do?

178
00:15:14,624 --> 00:15:16,825
[SPEAKER_17]: Again, that would be at the discretion of the committee.

179
00:15:17,045 --> 00:15:18,465
[SPEAKER_17]: I did not put a location.

180
00:15:18,545 --> 00:15:21,947
[SPEAKER_17]: I indicated City Hall just for a generalization.

181
00:15:22,047 --> 00:15:23,648
[SPEAKER_17]: So that would be up to the committee how they

182
00:15:24,118 --> 00:15:25,619
[SPEAKER_17]: Wanted to call the motion.

183
00:15:26,019 --> 00:15:26,420
[SPEAKER_03]: You second it.

184
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,401
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion by motion.

185
00:15:28,521 --> 00:15:28,681
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

186
00:15:29,101 --> 00:15:33,184
[SPEAKER_03]: School committee woman credits seconded by school committee woman McLaughlin.

187
00:15:33,845 --> 00:15:34,525
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor.

188
00:15:35,185 --> 00:15:35,786
[SPEAKER_03]: I was opposed.

189
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

190
00:15:37,421 --> 00:15:47,606
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll have these meetings in room 207, and I'll talk to Patrick Gordon from Community Cable, as well as our city clerk knows how to use the equipment, so we'll get that done.

191
00:15:47,626 --> 00:15:48,006
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

192
00:15:48,026 --> 00:15:51,568
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just had one other minor request, if possible.

193
00:15:52,088 --> 00:16:05,115
[SPEAKER_06]: Once we have the final approved dates, can we put the dates, I don't know if it's possible, on the website underneath our regular school committee dates, so that if people forgot what dates they are, they'll be somewhere

194
00:16:05,515 --> 00:16:25,545
[SPEAKER_06]: where people can just easily go and look at them and maybe we could share it with the press release if we could ask Lisa Evangelista if she could put together a press release once the dates are finalized if these are the tentative dates and we could just share it via social media to engage the public a little bit more because last year people didn't know about them so I'm trying to get the word out there this year.

195
00:16:27,626 --> 00:16:28,087
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that a motion?

196
00:16:28,887 --> 00:16:31,969
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah that'll be I guess a second motion a second motion to

197
00:16:33,714 --> 00:16:38,077
[SPEAKER_06]: put together a press release to share the dates so people can share them on social media.

198
00:16:38,217 --> 00:16:44,661
[SPEAKER_06]: And if possible, I don't know if there's room on the website to fit the dates underneath our regular school committee meetings.

199
00:16:45,342 --> 00:16:47,763
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know the structure of the website.

200
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:51,686
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's why I'm not sure about that, but if you could check into that.

201
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:52,346
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

202
00:16:52,867 --> 00:16:53,267
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

203
00:16:54,468 --> 00:16:56,309
[SPEAKER_03]: School committee woman McLaughlin.

204
00:16:57,578 --> 00:17:08,104
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, I just wanted to say thank you for putting those together for the dates and also one of the questions I was going to ask is when they would be available on the website but also I'm not sure.

205
00:17:08,164 --> 00:17:25,874
[SPEAKER_14]: I know that the other dates go out for the, with the public relations folks and so adding to the dates in the newsletter that goes out that, you know, the committee of the whole budget meetings are coming up so that it's another way of reminding but I think it's great for the public to know so thank you.

206
00:17:27,653 --> 00:17:30,923
[SPEAKER_03]: So motion by school committee woman, okay.

207
00:17:32,528 --> 00:17:33,591
[SPEAKER_16]: School committee woman, Graham.

208
00:17:35,922 --> 00:17:36,603
[SPEAKER_16]: One other thought.

209
00:17:37,063 --> 00:17:58,041
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe we can just combine all of these together, but we should have some sort of committee of the whole before this whole process gets started so that we can put our put our thoughts together and understand what we think we want to see in terms of the data that comes to us from a budgeting perspective so that when the department chairs are working to put their stuff together, if there's something

210
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:09,658
[SPEAKER_16]: particular that we know that we'll want to see that we can give everyone that advanced notice so that they can get that together rather than feeling like they have to respond to that stuff on the fly as those questions come up.

211
00:18:09,678 --> 00:18:13,920
[SPEAKER_16]: Because I think there's things that I can think of that I'd like to be able to see in writing.

212
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,620
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm sure everyone has those things.

213
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:24,343
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm not sure if we can do something in terms of budget planning before this whole process starts so that we can just all be on the same page about what to expect.

214
00:18:26,746 --> 00:18:51,642
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, so motion by school committee woman Kreatz to get the budget agenda on a press release and on social media and on the website as well as amended by school committee woman McLaughlin for newsletter and further amended by school committee woman Graham to get a committee of the whole meeting to get data and budget planning.

215
00:18:52,322 --> 00:18:57,023
[SPEAKER_03]: on a motion for approval by School Committee Woman Kreatz, seconded by School Committee Woman Van der Kloot.

216
00:18:57,063 --> 00:18:57,763
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

217
00:18:58,323 --> 00:18:58,463
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

218
00:18:58,763 --> 00:18:59,463
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

219
00:19:00,304 --> 00:19:00,984
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

220
00:19:04,064 --> 00:19:05,805
[SPEAKER_17]: Are these the dates that we are going with?

221
00:19:05,885 --> 00:19:07,165
[SPEAKER_17]: I didn't hear that actual.

222
00:19:15,567 --> 00:19:16,147
[SPEAKER_03]: I wrote that down.

223
00:19:16,547 --> 00:19:16,707
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

224
00:19:20,217 --> 00:19:29,942
[SPEAKER_03]: and everybody has seen the dates, we have guidance, English, social studies, mathematics, science, and world languages on February 24th, 2020, 5.30 to 7.

225

226
00:19:42,949 --> 00:19:47,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Middle school, high school, vocational, technical education, student activities and programs,

227
00:19:48,535 --> 00:19:52,138
[SPEAKER_03]: on April 6th, 2020, 5.30 to 7 p.m.

228
00:19:52,779 --> 00:20:00,465
[SPEAKER_03]: We have English learner education, special education on April 13th, 2020, 5.30 to 7 p.m.

229
00:20:01,185 --> 00:20:06,770
[SPEAKER_03]: We have the school committee, finance, business, district-wide expenses, and district-wide, May 4th, 2020.

230
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:07,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Transportation, security, and OSP on May 18th, 2020.

231
00:20:08,011 --> 00:20:09,572
[SPEAKER_03]: We will reserve June 1st, 2020,

232
00:20:18,263 --> 00:20:25,489
[SPEAKER_03]: If needed, and the budget hearing presentation will be the last school committee meeting on June 15th, 2020.

233
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:27,750
[SPEAKER_03]: Superintendent.

234
00:20:30,772 --> 00:20:43,862
[SPEAKER_10]: So in response, in order to add an additional committee of the whole, that would be at our next regularly scheduled meeting, which is February 3rd, in response to your request, school committee member Graham.

235
00:20:46,057 --> 00:20:49,498
[SPEAKER_10]: in keeping with the meetings that are lined up.

236
00:20:50,998 --> 00:20:52,919
[SPEAKER_03]: We can try that, or we can try the week before.

237
00:20:52,959 --> 00:20:54,179
[SPEAKER_03]: But we'll get that scheduled.

238
00:20:54,579 --> 00:20:54,799
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

239
00:21:01,101 --> 00:21:02,102
[SPEAKER_03]: School Committeewoman Graham.

240
00:21:02,862 --> 00:21:04,722

[SPEAKER_03]: Motion for approval by School Committeewoman Graham, seconded by School Committeewoman Van der Kloot.

242
00:21:10,464 --> 00:21:11,204
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

243
00:21:11,224 --> 00:21:11,824
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

244
00:21:11,844 --> 00:21:12,765
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

245
00:21:13,045 --> 00:21:13,905
[SPEAKER_03]: Schedule is adopted.

246
00:21:16,915 --> 00:21:22,621
[SPEAKER_03]: Number three, report on Department of Health Services best practices by Tony, is Tony ready?

247
00:21:22,982 --> 00:21:23,302
Yes.

248
00:21:25,504 --> 00:21:27,246
[SPEAKER_08]: Good evening and welcome Mayor.

249
00:21:27,346 --> 00:21:27,647
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

250
00:21:27,667 --> 00:21:30,570
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome new school committee members and hello to everybody else.

251
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:36,216
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm here just to give a little overview of the Health Services Department, especially for our new...

252
00:21:41,897 --> 00:21:53,600
[SPEAKER_08]: that the nurses follow the National Association of School Nursing 21st century framework and align with the whole school, whole community, whole child framework.

253
00:21:56,421 --> 00:22:04,403
[SPEAKER_08]: These activities and best practices go above and beyond Band-Aids, illnesses, and just what many people think of school nursing practice.

254
00:22:06,965 --> 00:22:16,535
[SPEAKER_08]: So the elementary school nurses in the fall conducted vision screening for all of our kindergarten students using a new state-of-the-art vision screener.

255
00:22:17,354 --> 00:22:26,479
[SPEAKER_08]: It was on loan from our regional Department of Public Health, and we were effectively able to screen all of the kindergarten students within four days.

256
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:33,704
[SPEAKER_08]: The screen are screens for the most common cause of blindness in children, which is amblyopia.

257
00:22:34,984 --> 00:22:39,367
[SPEAKER_08]: And we are looking forward to screening our preschool students by the end of January.

258
00:22:42,042 --> 00:22:51,226
[SPEAKER_08]: At the high school, Lisa Skiffington, Jennifer Silva, and Stephanie McCann focused on reducing the administration of Tylenol for minor complaints.

259
00:22:51,926 --> 00:23:00,470
[SPEAKER_08]: Last year, over 900 doses of Tylenol were given, and students have a habit of asking for that as their first request.

260
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:05,432
[SPEAKER_08]: So the nurses decided they would do some education around ways to

261
00:23:07,874 --> 00:23:13,035
[SPEAKER_08]: ways to identify their acute symptoms and find alternate ways of treating that.

262
00:23:14,115 --> 00:23:32,680
[SPEAKER_08]: And at the Curtis Tufts High School, Ashley Donnelly created a calm corner in the nurse's office and she incorporated mindfulness into her practice with the students with the goal to help students access stress management techniques and find and build positive coping skills.

263
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:37,161
[SPEAKER_08]: The feedback so far has been really positive on that.

264
00:23:39,062 --> 00:23:48,387
[SPEAKER_08]: At the Andrews Middle School, Avery Hines is working on a similar project to increase student time on learning by helping students manage their anxiety complaints.

265
00:23:49,047 --> 00:24:07,817
[SPEAKER_08]: And she has students rate their anxiety, they set a timer, and they have a corresponding number of minutes to build on different stress-reducing techniques or relaxation techniques so that they can then turn around and get back to school, back to class

266
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,841
[SPEAKER_08]: in a very timely manner.

267
00:24:12,123 --> 00:24:22,031
[SPEAKER_08]: If students find that more time is needed, then she will sit and spend extra time sparking an in-depth conversation with them or a referral to a guidance Councilor or adjustment Councilor.

268
00:24:24,333 --> 00:24:34,381
[SPEAKER_08]: At the Brooks Elementary School, Patricia Cooney and Allison McGilvery worked on expanding care coordination services for students who have ongoing complex health needs.

269
00:24:35,834 --> 00:25:00,166
[SPEAKER_08]: Pat successfully advocated for the use of specialized medical equipment for a student and was able to provide very relevant and pertinent observations to a specialty care provider that resulted in the scheduling of additional medical evaluations for this student so that accommodations could be made in school and this student could access his or her curriculum.

270
00:25:01,726 --> 00:25:04,228
[SPEAKER_08]: Allison identified students who had greater than 300 nursing

271
00:25:05,516 --> 00:25:16,045
[SPEAKER_08]: office visits for somatic complaints, and she collaborated with the team at the Brooks to then develop behavioral support plans aimed at increasing time in class.

272
00:25:20,249 --> 00:25:29,738
[SPEAKER_08]: At the Columbus Elementary School, Karen Roberto and Laurie Borriello implemented health education classes on the topics of asthma and the brain and behavior connection.

273
00:25:30,358 --> 00:25:30,759
[SPEAKER_08]: Karen

274
00:25:31,703 --> 00:25:39,228
[SPEAKER_08]: secured grant funding and was able to purchase the Radical Randy Mannequin and an asthma education program.

275
00:25:40,168 --> 00:25:55,718
[SPEAKER_08]: And she and Laurie teach students how to recognize their signs of distress, identify what their triggers are, use their medications appropriately so that they can avoid their triggers and hopefully stay in class without feeling ill.

276
00:25:57,282 --> 00:26:07,956
[SPEAKER_08]: In addition, they worked with the students to develop a presentation about how the brain and the body connects with behavior, and they showcased that at a school science fair.

277
00:26:10,479 --> 00:26:12,402
[SPEAKER_08]: At the McGlynn Elementary and Middle Schools,

278
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:35,459
[SPEAKER_08]: Carla Constanza, Karen Breen, and Peggy Donahue, and Lori Borello created bulletin boards for their students where they post, every month they post pertinent health information, very visual, and it's a great learning experience for the English language learner, students to identify different health needs and ways that they can manage those health needs.

279
00:26:37,394 --> 00:26:49,540
[SPEAKER_08]: And lastly, at the Roberts Elementary School, Brianna Cormos and Ashley Donnelly are working to improve access to healthcare by connecting newly immigrated families with local primary care physicians.

280
00:26:50,520 --> 00:27:01,365
[SPEAKER_08]: They coordinate care between primary care offices, special education, general education teachers, and they use translators to assist with immunization, surveillance, and follow-up.

281
00:27:03,696 --> 00:27:11,363
[SPEAKER_08]: Both nurses have supported our international families with scheduling medical appointments for immunizations and tuberculosis screening follow-up.

282
00:27:13,245 --> 00:27:20,671
[SPEAKER_08]: Brianna and Ashley also piloted a translation phone service so that they could communicate with these families.

283
00:27:20,991 --> 00:27:27,057
[SPEAKER_08]: And as a result, we are now using it around all the health offices throughout the district.

284
00:27:32,177 --> 00:27:35,858
[SPEAKER_03]: So just a few highlights of the ways that we help our families.

285
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:36,719
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.

286
00:27:37,019 --> 00:27:38,039
[SPEAKER_03]: We have some questions, I believe.

287
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,720
[SPEAKER_06]: School Committeewoman Kreatz.

288
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:40,420
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi.

289
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:40,960
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

290
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:41,361
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Ms.

291
00:27:41,401 --> 00:27:41,961
[SPEAKER_06]: Rae, for the report.

292
00:27:41,981 --> 00:27:45,402
[SPEAKER_06]: It was very interesting reading about all the different techniques.

293
00:27:46,442 --> 00:27:48,983
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just curious about the high school.

294
00:27:49,884 --> 00:27:53,345
[SPEAKER_06]: What were the most common reasons why the students were requesting Tylenol?

295
00:27:53,745 --> 00:27:56,006
[SPEAKER_06]: Was it stomachache, headache?

296
00:27:56,206 --> 00:27:57,407
[SPEAKER_06]: A wide range of things.

297
00:27:57,967 --> 00:27:58,467
[SPEAKER_08]: Fatigue.

298
00:27:59,542 --> 00:28:14,656
[SPEAKER_08]: Lack of breakfast, lack of lunch, certainly any emerging illness, headaches, as well as muscle soreness and muscle aches at the start of each sports season.

299
00:28:15,577 --> 00:28:24,545
[SPEAKER_08]: So the focus became how can we tease out what the real problem is and how can we address that in ways beyond medication.

300
00:28:26,123 --> 00:28:45,857
[SPEAKER_06]: And I did read that I guess a handout was developed for the students with the education like to help them Is that something that you would be able to share with us like to just see it would be you know, interesting to read about sure Thank you Thank you, thank you and miss stone

301
00:28:47,129 --> 00:28:49,650
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, thanks Miss Ray for all this information.

302
00:28:50,971 --> 00:28:59,194
[SPEAKER_07]: It is really impressive all the work that nurses do and it seems like it almost is that a caseworker is needed.

303
00:28:59,214 --> 00:29:04,677
[SPEAKER_07]: Excuse me, so when there's a vision screening and you send the referral letter, is there, I know,

304
00:29:05,894 --> 00:29:09,556
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there a follow-up to say, you got the referral letter, but did you actually go to the eye doctor?

305
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:11,457
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, that's required.

306
00:29:11,477 --> 00:29:16,579
[SPEAKER_08]: That's part of our role and responsibilities and reporting responsibilities to the Department of Public Health.

307
00:29:17,299 --> 00:29:29,905
[SPEAKER_08]: So that becomes the casework of the individual building nurse to follow up on those referrals to make sure that students are connected and do see an appropriate health care provider.

308
00:29:30,464 --> 00:29:30,604
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

309
00:29:30,664 --> 00:29:34,407
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's time consuming when they have kids waiting in their office.

310
00:29:34,487 --> 00:29:45,374
[SPEAKER_07]: And even with, um, at the Curtis Tufts, when students want to go for management techniques, how do you have any idea of how many students a day go or how long they stay?

311
00:29:45,775 --> 00:29:47,636
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, no, I, that, that I don't.

312
00:29:47,916 --> 00:29:53,660
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, um, and stay there can be anywhere from a few minutes to maybe 15 or 20 minutes.

313
00:29:54,421 --> 00:29:55,762
[SPEAKER_08]: Just depends on the student.

314
00:29:55,862 --> 00:29:57,543
[SPEAKER_08]: The aim is really to,

315
00:29:58,291 --> 00:30:06,955
[SPEAKER_08]: help students access those techniques, use them effectively, and get back to class in a timely manner so that it doesn't become a place to hang out.

316
00:30:07,935 --> 00:30:10,196
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a place to regroup and get back to class.

317
00:30:11,102 --> 00:30:19,445
[SPEAKER_07]: And as the state mandates more and more on your department, do you think, is there a new profession for caseworkers in the nursing office?

318
00:30:19,846 --> 00:30:22,247
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all encompassed within our role.

319
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:36,733
[SPEAKER_08]: So the National Association of School Nurses 21st Century encompasses all of that care coordination and care management, as well as the whole school, whole child, whole community model.

320
00:30:39,238 --> 00:30:45,822
[SPEAKER_08]: We as school nurses have been doing this for quite a long time, but it's really a student needs expand.

321
00:30:46,202 --> 00:30:48,403
[SPEAKER_08]: We are expanding our care coordination.

322
00:30:49,023 --> 00:30:51,004
[SPEAKER_08]: And yes, it is time consuming.

323
00:30:51,244 --> 00:30:51,424
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

324
00:30:51,865 --> 00:30:58,228
[SPEAKER_07]: So I guess we can wait till budget meetings, but it'd be that you would be hiring more nurses to take on all the casework.

325
00:30:58,248 --> 00:30:58,468
[SPEAKER_07]: Possibly.

326
00:30:58,628 --> 00:30:58,928
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

327
00:30:59,289 --> 00:31:02,090
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I mean, it's incredible all the work they do at all the schools.

328
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:02,810
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you.

329
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:02,991
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

330
00:31:03,891 --> 00:31:04,231
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

331
00:31:06,812 --> 00:31:07,553
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice Chair Rousseau.

332
00:31:08,954 --> 00:31:10,576
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for this report.

333
00:31:10,596 --> 00:31:13,640
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't get away without hearing from me.

334
00:31:14,801 --> 00:31:22,470
[SPEAKER_01]: At the Brooks, I think you've reported this once before in the last two years about students that visit more than 300 times in a year.

335
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:24,713
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's worth noting students aren't in school for 365.

336
00:31:24,753 --> 00:31:25,033
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 180 days.

337
00:31:29,786 --> 00:31:39,819
[SPEAKER_01]: And it led me to this thought or question about like literally every item on this report is something that's amazing.

338
00:31:40,199 --> 00:31:42,942
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just wondering, does your department come together to share?

339
00:31:43,841 --> 00:31:46,982
[SPEAKER_01]: best practices and replicate these.

340
00:31:47,002 --> 00:31:49,504
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's only so much time in a day for every nurse.

341
00:31:49,544 --> 00:31:50,064
[SPEAKER_01]: I get that.

342
00:31:50,184 --> 00:32:01,589
[SPEAKER_01]: But as certain elements of this report are determined to be more successful perhaps than others, how do those get replicated out to the rest of the school?

343
00:32:01,629 --> 00:32:04,510
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is it really up to every nurse to be like, oh, hey, you're doing that.

344
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:05,211
[SPEAKER_01]: That's interesting.

345
00:32:05,491 --> 00:32:06,751
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to do that.

346
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:09,132
[SPEAKER_08]: We tend to do it in a staff meeting format.

347
00:32:12,022 --> 00:32:17,686
[SPEAKER_08]: just sharing our practices, things that I'm aware of I will try to share out to everybody else.

348
00:32:18,526 --> 00:32:33,996
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of the things like the translation phone service that was piloted and then we had such good luck with it that it went out very quickly to everybody to say this is how you access this service and please use it for short communications with your families.

349
00:32:35,167 --> 00:32:43,192
[SPEAKER_01]: So for instance, at the Brooks, where there are students, I mean, I don't know how many, but have more than 300 visits to the nurse's office per school year.

350
00:32:45,013 --> 00:32:50,316
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you track that for all of the schools and have any idea, is the Brooks unusual?

351
00:32:51,256 --> 00:32:53,197
[SPEAKER_08]: I can track that for all of the schools.

352
00:32:53,898 --> 00:33:02,663
[SPEAKER_08]: I really place a lot of independence on each school nurse to know their building and to

353
00:33:04,046 --> 00:33:07,627
[SPEAKER_08]: use their role to meet the needs, the health needs in their buildings.

354
00:33:09,148 --> 00:33:11,488
[SPEAKER_08]: But yes, we can pull up that information.

355
00:33:11,508 --> 00:33:15,489
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a little bit unwieldy with school brains, but we can pull it up.

356
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:16,530
[SPEAKER_01]: We've talked about that.

357
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:18,870
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, I mean, because I'm not,

358
00:33:22,138 --> 00:33:26,979
[SPEAKER_01]: Having more than 300 visits per school year, I mean, there may be children that, in fact, this is perfectly reasonable.

359
00:33:26,999 --> 00:33:29,240
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to visit the nurse more than twice a day for medication.

360
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:30,741
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom, you're over 300.

361
00:33:30,821 --> 00:33:31,221
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

362
00:33:31,241 --> 00:33:39,943
[SPEAKER_08]: So they're looking at children that are coming in multiple times a day for what seem to be somatic complaints.

363
00:33:40,884 --> 00:33:44,065
[SPEAKER_08]: And typically, it falls under kids who need behavioral health supports.

364
00:33:44,905 --> 00:33:45,085
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.

365
00:33:45,245 --> 00:33:45,505
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

366
00:33:48,279 --> 00:33:50,384
[SPEAKER_03]: School Committee Woman Van der Kloot.

367
00:33:50,744 --> 00:33:53,270
[SPEAKER_15]: My colleagues have answered all my questions.

368
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:54,252
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

369
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:54,813
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

370
00:33:56,376 --> 00:33:58,801
[SPEAKER_03]: School Committee Woman McLaughlin.

371
00:33:59,242 --> 00:33:59,543
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

372
00:34:00,073 --> 00:34:01,234
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for the report, Ms.

373
00:34:01,274 --> 00:34:01,334
[SPEAKER_14]: Ray.

374
00:34:01,354 --> 00:34:02,955
[SPEAKER_14]: It was very informational.

375
00:34:02,975 --> 00:34:03,595
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciate it.

376
00:34:04,956 --> 00:34:06,657
[SPEAKER_14]: I had some follow-up questions, too.

377
00:34:06,897 --> 00:34:22,465
[SPEAKER_14]: On the Brooks School for the somatization of the visits of identified students who have above 300 nursing office visits for somatic complaints and the policy put in place, I'm wondering

378
00:34:24,146 --> 00:34:27,608
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you have, or would there be a number on how many students that is?

379
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:29,350
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, if it's one student, it's one thing.

380
00:34:29,410 --> 00:34:30,210
[SPEAKER_14]: If it's 10 or 20.

381
00:34:30,851 --> 00:34:36,755
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd have to work with Kim Miles to pull that data out of school brains.

382
00:34:36,935 --> 00:34:38,836
[SPEAKER_08]: Allison was working with these students.

383
00:34:38,856 --> 00:34:43,039
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it wasn't like she had dozens of them.

384
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:45,320
[SPEAKER_08]: There were a few that she was working with.

385
00:34:45,981 --> 00:34:50,424
[SPEAKER_08]: But to specifically do it district wide, I'd have to work with Kim Miles to help me do that.

386
00:34:51,149 --> 00:34:52,690
[SPEAKER_14]: It's very useful data.

387
00:34:52,710 --> 00:35:01,959
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, a theme I think that we see throughout your report is the concern around anxiety for our children, which is an ever-growing concern, I think, with our 24-7 social media.

388
00:35:04,194 --> 00:35:07,557
[SPEAKER_14]: everything else that our children have to deal with in today's element.

389
00:35:07,597 --> 00:35:16,383
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think that the somatization is interesting, but also how about the, or do you know when parents, at what point parents might be notified?

390
00:35:17,104 --> 00:35:21,807
[SPEAKER_14]: Obviously, if a student is coming to the office for medicine, we know that the parent knows that.

391
00:35:22,148 --> 00:35:29,113
[SPEAKER_14]: But if it's for something, a bellyache or whatever, you know, if there's 10 times, 20 times, 30 times, at what point would a parent be notified?

392
00:35:29,133 --> 00:35:31,154
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I don't think you can put a number on it.

393
00:35:31,214 --> 00:35:32,035
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's a,

394
00:35:33,836 --> 00:35:36,777
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the relationship that the nurse establishes with the student.

395
00:35:37,437 --> 00:35:49,140
[SPEAKER_08]: And if she's determining that it's above and beyond something that a behavioral support in the office can manage, then she'll reach out and say, I'm concerned.

396
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:51,900
[SPEAKER_08]: I think you need to have your child checked by the doctor.

397
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:54,141
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm seeing this is happening all too many times.

398
00:35:54,181 --> 00:35:55,961
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not just that he's not eating breakfast.

399
00:35:57,381 --> 00:35:59,042
[SPEAKER_08]: It seems to be other things going on.

400
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:04,133
[SPEAKER_08]: It's something that that nurse will tease out within her relationship with the student.

401
00:36:04,634 --> 00:36:06,495
[SPEAKER_14]: Right, with the parent and the schools.

402
00:36:07,056 --> 00:36:07,876
[SPEAKER_14]: Great, that's great.

403
00:36:08,317 --> 00:36:12,900
[SPEAKER_14]: They're obviously doing a great job across the schools and working together on the report.

404
00:36:13,081 --> 00:36:19,946
[SPEAKER_14]: I was wondering also, Tony, about the telephone translation services, which is really exciting.

405
00:36:19,986 --> 00:36:20,427
[SPEAKER_08]: It is exciting.

406
00:36:20,447 --> 00:36:21,568
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for piloting that.

407
00:36:21,908 --> 00:36:22,408
[SPEAKER_14]: That's great.

408
00:36:22,428 --> 00:36:29,034
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to thank Paul Texera because he had provided me with a lot of information about services out there.

409
00:36:29,447 --> 00:36:38,535
[SPEAKER_14]: That's great, that's one of the things that I wanted to ask you is how are you collaborating with the EL department for that, but clearly other departments that might be interested in the translation service.

410
00:36:39,616 --> 00:36:42,158
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm assuming, I know we're getting a report from Paul shortly.

411
00:36:43,299 --> 00:36:54,089
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're using it for those short phone calls that nurses need to make to say your child has a fever, please, we need you to come pick him or her up.

412
00:36:54,549 --> 00:36:56,691
[SPEAKER_08]: It is expensive, as a minute,

413
00:36:57,044 --> 00:36:58,605
[SPEAKER_08]: per minute charge that is expensive.

414
00:36:58,645 --> 00:37:05,088
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's not anything we can use for a sit down meeting or any, you know, we're, we're using it for the short phone calls.

415
00:37:05,568 --> 00:37:08,249
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I sent you home a vision referral.

416
00:37:08,289 --> 00:37:11,911
[SPEAKER_08]: You haven't seen the doctor yet, or I haven't had a note that you've seen the doctor yet.

417
00:37:11,931 --> 00:37:13,151
[SPEAKER_08]: Can we follow up on this?

418
00:37:13,812 --> 00:37:20,915
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, you know, messages of those types, your child's delinquent on immunizations or do for immunizations, things like that.

419
00:37:21,735 --> 00:37:22,916
[SPEAKER_14]: And when was it piloted?

420
00:37:23,693 --> 00:37:25,053
[SPEAKER_08]: November, early November.

421
00:37:25,253 --> 00:37:25,494
[SPEAKER_14]: Great.

422
00:37:26,054 --> 00:37:27,334
[SPEAKER_14]: So you have some data on it at this point.

423
00:37:27,534 --> 00:37:31,315
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is funded by our comprehensive school health services grant.

424
00:37:31,895 --> 00:37:36,577
[SPEAKER_08]: The money that we have available for that is through that grant.

425
00:37:38,157 --> 00:37:42,278
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm assuming in our budget meetings, you'll tell us more about your grants that you're working on.

426
00:37:42,318 --> 00:37:45,419
[SPEAKER_14]: I know that you work on those often, and we appreciate the work around that.

427
00:37:45,439 --> 00:37:45,799
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

428
00:37:46,139 --> 00:37:46,579
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

429
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:46,940
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

430
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:47,540
[SPEAKER_14]: Very good.

431
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:47,880
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

432
00:37:54,642 --> 00:37:56,509
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a student member that has a question?

433
00:37:57,894 --> 00:37:59,119
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on up and use the microphone.

434
00:38:09,633 --> 00:38:11,914
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just had like two quick questions.

435
00:38:12,314 --> 00:38:13,954
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, the first one's about the high school.

436
00:38:14,975 --> 00:38:18,396
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, what would be like other ways, like other ways to help?

437
00:38:18,836 --> 00:38:20,396
[SPEAKER_12]: Like that you wouldn't use the Tylenol.

438
00:38:20,816 --> 00:38:22,357
[SPEAKER_12]: Like what would, what else would you use?

439
00:38:22,657 --> 00:38:31,440
[SPEAKER_08]: So some very basic, um, approaches are to make sure that you're well hydrated because being dehydrated will cause headaches.

440
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:35,621
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, making sure that breakfast and lunch are eaten because

441
00:38:36,192 --> 00:38:42,974
[SPEAKER_08]: If you don't have food in your body, you're not going to be able to chug along through the day and attend to your studies like you need to do.

442
00:38:43,014 --> 00:38:44,194
[SPEAKER_08]: You just won't have that energy.

443
00:38:45,214 --> 00:38:52,836
[SPEAKER_08]: Getting adequate rest, so turning off the cell phone by 9 o'clock at night and getting into bed and getting a good night's sleep.

444
00:38:53,236 --> 00:38:58,217
[SPEAKER_08]: It tends to be very basic strategies that everybody can use.

445
00:39:00,347 --> 00:39:05,551
[SPEAKER_12]: And then do you think, I know you mentioned sleep, and I'm a high school, I'm a senior.

446
00:39:06,031 --> 00:39:08,993
[SPEAKER_12]: I've gone days where I've slept only two hours.

447
00:39:09,373 --> 00:39:22,143
[SPEAKER_12]: So what if a student comes up to you, and they're obviously not a student that's just trying to skip class, but they've obviously had a rough night where they probably forgot a paper.

448
00:39:22,203 --> 00:39:23,303
[SPEAKER_12]: What would you do to them?

449
00:39:23,343 --> 00:39:27,446
[SPEAKER_12]: Would you just send them back to class without giving them Tylenol or something?

450
00:39:27,566 --> 00:39:29,147
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it depends on the situation.

451
00:39:30,427 --> 00:39:40,253
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes we will give them a snack, hydrate them, and then, you know, if after a few minutes of rest they're still not feeling better, they may get some Tylenol to go back to class.

452
00:39:40,574 --> 00:39:44,056
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's definitely not used as a first-line intervention.

453
00:39:45,237 --> 00:39:50,400
[SPEAKER_08]: We're really trying to encourage really good, healthy habits that are lifelong habits.

454
00:39:51,565 --> 00:39:53,246
[SPEAKER_12]: And then, sorry, I just have one last question.

455
00:39:53,847 --> 00:40:07,136
[SPEAKER_12]: With the last one at the Roberts Elementary School, where you have translation services, do you by any chance, who answers, who uses, not who uses, but who helps with the translations?

456
00:40:08,937 --> 00:40:17,963
[SPEAKER_08]: So the service is set up, we have a number, a phone number to dial, the nurse dials in, tells them the language that is needed for translation.

457
00:40:20,635 --> 00:40:23,356
[SPEAKER_08]: Beyond that, I'm not exactly sure how it works.

458
00:40:23,436 --> 00:40:25,637
[SPEAKER_08]: And Paul may be able to answer that a little bit better.

459
00:40:25,697 --> 00:40:31,980
[SPEAKER_08]: But we are connected with the translation for a message.

460
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:35,902
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, so it's not somebody from the city or anything?

461
00:40:36,002 --> 00:40:37,482
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not somebody from the city?

462
00:40:37,742 --> 00:40:39,943
[SPEAKER_12]: No, no, it's an outside service.

463
00:40:41,204 --> 00:40:42,425
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a professional service.

464
00:40:43,225 --> 00:40:43,765
[SPEAKER_03]: Good job.

465
00:40:44,665 --> 00:40:45,006
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

466
00:40:45,206 --> 00:40:45,566
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

467
00:40:48,637 --> 00:40:51,779
[SPEAKER_03]: for report on English learners, Paul Textera.

468
00:40:57,561 --> 00:40:58,402
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening, everyone.

469
00:40:58,422 --> 00:40:58,902
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening.

470
00:40:58,962 --> 00:41:00,163
[SPEAKER_00]: And welcome to the new members.

471
00:41:00,183 --> 00:41:01,123
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

472
00:41:01,263 --> 00:41:05,005
[SPEAKER_00]: And to follow up to answer your question, it's kind of like a three-way call.

473
00:41:05,285 --> 00:41:13,349
[SPEAKER_00]: You call into the calling center, you identify which language you need, they get somebody on the line, and then everyone's dialed in at the same time.

474
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:15,370
[SPEAKER_03]: Great, thank you.

475
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:24,782
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are in the middle of access testing, and for those of you unfamiliar with access, it is a state-mandated test.

476
00:41:25,563 --> 00:41:29,424
[SPEAKER_00]: It is administered over a series of several days.

477
00:41:30,104 --> 00:41:34,645
[SPEAKER_00]: Every building is a little bit different because the test is different depending upon your grade level.

478
00:41:35,486 --> 00:41:40,227
[SPEAKER_00]: This test measures the four domains of language, reading, writing, listening, and speaking.

479
00:41:41,661 --> 00:41:51,032
[SPEAKER_00]: And we get the reports at the very end of May, beginning of June, and we use this data to make our placement determinations for students for the following school year.

480
00:41:51,893 --> 00:41:57,519
[SPEAKER_00]: So the high school has completed their access testing with the exception of make-ups.

481
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:03,183
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently the Roberts and the McGlynn Elementary are doing their access testing.

482
00:42:03,844 --> 00:42:15,430
[SPEAKER_00]: Columbus will be starting on Wednesday, McGlynn Middle School on Tuesday, and then the following Wednesday, or I'm sorry, the following Thursday begins the Brooks.

483
00:42:15,931 --> 00:42:20,233
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll be completed with our access testing across the district by January 26th.

484
00:42:20,794 --> 00:42:21,974
[SPEAKER_00]: We space it out so

485
00:42:23,095 --> 00:42:26,397
[SPEAKER_00]: We can have the appropriate technology support in each of the buildings.

486
00:42:26,417 --> 00:42:34,300
[SPEAKER_00]: The first couple days are the most critical because if there are any issues that need to be addressed, that sets the stage for the rest of the testing.

487
00:42:38,402 --> 00:42:43,284
[SPEAKER_00]: I did give you 2019's access scores in the chart.

488
00:42:43,725 --> 00:42:48,827
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to read it to you, but if anyone has any questions on that or the test, I can answer those now.

489
00:42:50,448 --> 00:42:50,568
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

490
00:42:52,412 --> 00:42:53,212
[SPEAKER_03]: School committee woman, Ms.

491
00:42:53,232 --> 00:42:53,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Stone.

492
00:42:55,293 --> 00:43:03,698
[SPEAKER_07]: The only question is, it seemed like all of them increased in a positive number except for the Columbus and Medford High School.

493
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:13,943
[SPEAKER_07]: Could you look at it in more depth and if there was anything that you could see that you can address to make sure they go up next year?

494
00:43:14,575 --> 00:43:19,058
[SPEAKER_00]: So with the Columbus, if you notice from 2017, they had a huge increase between 2017 and 2018.

495
00:43:19,098 --> 00:43:20,459
[SPEAKER_00]: They went up over 24 percentage points.

496
00:43:20,479 --> 00:43:22,000
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think maybe this is leveling off this year.

497
00:43:30,813 --> 00:43:46,938
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of the decline itself, what we do is we get a report from the state on each individual student who has not made progress on the access test, and each EL teacher in the building gets a progress monitoring form for that student.

498
00:43:47,399 --> 00:43:50,199
[SPEAKER_00]: They get the previous year scores, the second year scores.

499
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:57,102
[SPEAKER_00]: They put together a building-based team, which would include the classroom teacher, the EL teacher, if they receive Title I,

500
00:43:58,702 --> 00:44:03,504
[SPEAKER_00]: and kind of put together supports for the students across the board.

501
00:44:03,544 --> 00:44:16,610
[SPEAKER_00]: They identify the areas of need, and based on those areas of need, so we're consistent, that's what's being delivered in the EL classroom for intervention and support, and that tier one is happening across the board for the students.

502
00:44:16,730 --> 00:44:19,011
[SPEAKER_00]: So that should continue to boost scores.

503
00:44:19,651 --> 00:44:20,911
[SPEAKER_00]: We do that at every school.

504
00:44:22,997 --> 00:44:29,966
[SPEAKER_00]: And then with Medford High School, we looked at our curriculum and we actually added another class this year.

505
00:44:30,487 --> 00:44:37,476
[SPEAKER_00]: We added a level of EL between 1 and 2, 1.5, it's original, to support the students who

506
00:44:38,977 --> 00:44:52,726
[SPEAKER_00]: may have come last year, but they weren't here for a full year, so they weren't quite ready for the level two, or some students test in at that level, so we added that level to try to catch students at the earlier stages of language acquisition.

507
00:44:52,906 --> 00:44:56,428
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how the two areas have been met on that.

508
00:44:57,389 --> 00:44:57,709
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

509
00:44:58,930 --> 00:44:59,590
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice Chair Rousseau.

510
00:45:00,841 --> 00:45:02,642
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the report.

511
00:45:03,123 --> 00:45:09,607
[SPEAKER_01]: Aside from the scores, which for the most part looked fine, and even the ones that were declined, we did meet targets.

512
00:45:09,667 --> 00:45:12,069
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's an important point.

513
00:45:13,370 --> 00:45:15,051
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't set our targets, the state does.

514
00:45:15,971 --> 00:45:23,517
[SPEAKER_01]: But I was most thrilled, and I would say not surprised because of the work that I've seen you do in the last couple of years,

515
00:45:24,077 --> 00:45:29,239
[SPEAKER_01]: to see that the program redesign is actually being considered as the blueprint for the state.

516
00:45:29,859 --> 00:45:32,040
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just wanted to say how impressive that was.

517
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:38,062
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you for your hard work and all the staff that are involved, because I know you don't actually do all of it yourself.

518
00:45:39,083 --> 00:45:39,583
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.

519
00:45:42,424 --> 00:45:42,764
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

520
00:45:44,165 --> 00:45:45,365
[SPEAKER_03]: School Committeewoman McLaughlin.

521
00:45:46,336 --> 00:45:49,959
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for your rapport and thank your staff for all their hard work.

522
00:45:51,961 --> 00:45:56,726
[SPEAKER_14]: And I see that, yes, Desi's interested in coming out to observe the program.

523
00:45:56,766 --> 00:45:57,947
[SPEAKER_14]: That's great news.

524
00:45:58,147 --> 00:45:58,988
[SPEAKER_14]: Congratulations.

525
00:46:00,149 --> 00:46:08,396
[SPEAKER_14]: And then I just had a question for the access accountability and the NA for the Brooks, not applicable for the Brooks.

526
00:46:08,436 --> 00:46:10,739
[SPEAKER_00]: Not enough students to get the data.

527
00:46:11,742 --> 00:46:23,307
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get the individual student reports, but the Department of Education doesn't have enough, there aren't enough EL students at the Brooks to put together the same data as the other schools.

528
00:46:24,828 --> 00:46:28,970
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, but you get the individual reports to know if they're meeting target?

529
00:46:29,030 --> 00:46:30,811
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, the individual student reports.

530
00:46:30,931 --> 00:46:34,672
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyone who's not making progress, we follow the same protocols at the Brooks.

531
00:46:35,493 --> 00:46:36,173
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, thank you.

532
00:46:40,573 --> 00:46:52,220
[SPEAKER_00]: And just with regard to the targets, meeting targets, those targets are established individually for students as well, and they do the same thing for the Brooke students.

533
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:58,904
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, there's just not enough students there to come up with the same calculations that they come up with.

534
00:46:59,411 --> 00:47:01,153
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry, go ahead.

535
00:47:01,533 --> 00:47:04,115
[SPEAKER_00]: No, so every student gets an individual target.

536
00:47:04,656 --> 00:47:14,085
[SPEAKER_00]: So based on where they were the previous year and so part of that progress monitoring report takes that into account that we know where that student needs to get for the next level.

537
00:47:14,465 --> 00:47:18,869
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they take all that information and that's how they make the overall determination.

538
00:47:21,111 --> 00:47:30,017
[SPEAKER_00]: if the schools met their target, and then as a whole, if the district met their target, which each school did meet a target, and the district met their target.

539
00:47:31,057 --> 00:47:40,043
[SPEAKER_14]: And do you know, I understand that the data is not significant enough for the reporting out to DESE, but do you know from your progress reports, personal reports, how the students are doing there?

540
00:47:40,693 --> 00:47:48,456
[SPEAKER_00]: So with the Brooks, it's a little bit different because they only, for the newcomer students, they house grades one and two.

541
00:47:48,876 --> 00:47:55,058
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they're a first year student, we wouldn't get data on those students because we don't have something from the previous year.

542
00:47:55,398 --> 00:47:57,999
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's only the students who have been here two or more years.

543
00:47:59,219 --> 00:47:59,600
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

544
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,001
[SPEAKER_06]: School Committeewoman Kreatz.

545
00:48:05,342 --> 00:48:08,883
[SPEAKER_06]: And like my colleagues, Mr. Russo and Ms.

546
00:48:08,923 --> 00:48:09,423
[SPEAKER_06]: McLaughlin,

547
00:48:09,857 --> 00:48:18,844
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a note too, congratulations on having the DESI maybe interested in coming out to see our program and I look forward to hearing more.

548
00:48:20,242 --> 00:48:27,145
[SPEAKER_06]: I did, I was just curious, how long does it take the students who are taking the online test to take their test?

549
00:48:27,565 --> 00:48:28,625
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it all day?

550
00:48:29,065 --> 00:48:32,807
[SPEAKER_06]: Do they get breaks or is it just spread out over the various days?

551
00:48:33,147 --> 00:48:34,007
[SPEAKER_00]: They get breaks.

552
00:48:34,107 --> 00:48:36,348
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, it's very different at every level.

553
00:48:36,448 --> 00:48:41,149
[SPEAKER_00]: So kindergarten is an individual one to one test and it takes about an hour.

554
00:48:41,329 --> 00:48:48,012
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are no, you know, the teacher can give breaks along the way if the student, if the teacher feels that the student needs it.

555
00:48:48,872 --> 00:48:48,952
[SPEAKER_00]: Um,

556
00:48:49,692 --> 00:48:56,435
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for grades 1 through 12, if they're doing the online, we usually do listening first and then reading.

557
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:59,637
[SPEAKER_00]: The listening test takes anywhere from 30 to 40 minutes.

558
00:49:00,297 --> 00:49:06,480
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we'll do that first while we have everyone in the lab and then students get a break before they jump into the reading.

559
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:09,902
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reading test will take about 60 to 70 minutes.

560
00:49:10,382 --> 00:49:11,903
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's all they'll do in one day.

561
00:49:12,863 --> 00:49:20,488
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the next day, they would come back and do the writing portion, which takes about 60 or 70 minutes for the writing.

562
00:49:21,088 --> 00:49:22,889
[SPEAKER_00]: And the speaking is about 30 minutes.

563
00:49:22,969 --> 00:49:25,550
[SPEAKER_00]: It really depends on the student's language proficiency level.

564
00:49:25,591 --> 00:49:30,333
[SPEAKER_00]: Newcomers will, it's a, the test is tiered.

565
00:49:30,814 --> 00:49:34,716
[SPEAKER_00]: So you start here, and once you hit a stopping point, you don't continue.

566
00:49:34,896 --> 00:49:39,459
[SPEAKER_00]: So that could be as quick as 15 minutes for some students, as long as 40 minutes for others.

567
00:49:39,979 --> 00:49:40,239
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

568
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:41,340
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

569
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:41,780
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

570
00:49:42,626 --> 00:49:43,714
[SPEAKER_06]: School Committee Woman, Graham.

571
00:49:47,083 --> 00:49:51,424
[SPEAKER_16]: I just wanted to say that this report was really easy to digest.

572
00:49:52,024 --> 00:49:58,826
[SPEAKER_16]: I think for me as a new school committee member, but I think anybody read this, they would really understand what you're doing.

573
00:49:59,026 --> 00:50:03,947
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think that's so important because these things sort of fly across in sound bites.

574
00:50:04,147 --> 00:50:08,268
[SPEAKER_16]: And I read it and I said, I don't even have one question about what I just read.

575
00:50:08,308 --> 00:50:10,188
[SPEAKER_16]: So I thought that was really awesome.

576
00:50:11,329 --> 00:50:16,290
[SPEAKER_16]: I also wanted to especially thank the teachers who are

577
00:50:18,231 --> 00:50:24,935
[SPEAKER_16]: Working through co-teaching and a new curriculum at the same time, I know how hard that is.

578
00:50:26,376 --> 00:50:38,544
[SPEAKER_16]: Either one of those things is really difficult, but to sort of change your stand and deliver approach as you're changing the content you're being asked to deliver as well is incredibly time-consuming, so thank you.

579
00:50:39,265 --> 00:50:42,087
[SPEAKER_16]: to both you and all the teachers that are making that happen.

580
00:50:42,147 --> 00:50:43,427
[SPEAKER_16]: I know it will be really worthwhile.

581
00:50:43,928 --> 00:50:48,851
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a, this is, we're in year two of this and we started last year with just science teachers.

582
00:50:48,991 --> 00:50:56,515
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Rocco Cieri was huge in helping to bring that, you know, Nick Tucci was huge in bringing about that shift.

583
00:50:56,535 --> 00:50:58,256
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so having the support

584
00:50:58,956 --> 00:51:13,640
[SPEAKER_00]: you know of everyone and then this year we extended it Bernadette Riccadeli is kind of overseeing the Co-teaching across the two middle schools because we're also doing the same thing for special ed and the content areas So it's it's grown from there.

585
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:14,820
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, that's wonderful.

586
00:51:14,860 --> 00:51:21,122
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you School committee woman McLaughlin Yes, the co-teaching model is really great news.

587
00:51:21,182 --> 00:51:22,042
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for that

588
00:51:22,984 --> 00:51:26,465
[SPEAKER_14]: I definitely concur with member Graham on that.

589
00:51:26,565 --> 00:51:41,409
[SPEAKER_14]: And I wanted to ask also, I'm assuming just in terms of the data, if someone were to read the report, if a community member wanted access to the report, the access data on the front page for the schools has all of the schools excluding the Andrews.

590
00:51:42,329 --> 00:51:44,970
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's because the Andrews does not have

591
00:51:45,442 --> 00:51:47,464
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no EL program at the Andrews.

592
00:51:47,684 --> 00:51:48,785
[SPEAKER_14]: No EL program at the Andrews.

593
00:51:48,825 --> 00:51:51,228
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, I wanted to just confirm on that.

594
00:51:51,348 --> 00:51:57,894
[SPEAKER_14]: And then you said there was a huge increase in Columbus from 2017, right?

595
00:51:58,115 --> 00:51:58,335
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

596
00:51:58,515 --> 00:52:07,104
[SPEAKER_14]: When you say huge increase, can you give me some idea of what that actually... Not literally, but some ballpark of how many?

597
00:52:08,196 --> 00:52:21,906
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of number of students, they've always hovered anywhere between 75 and 90 students, EL students at the Columbus, grades K through five.

598
00:52:22,707 --> 00:52:23,067
[SPEAKER_14]: 75 and 90?

599
00:52:23,347 --> 00:52:25,028
[SPEAKER_00]: Between 75 and 90 every year.

600
00:52:25,549 --> 00:52:29,652
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of the increase, again, they went up.

601
00:52:31,207 --> 00:52:50,173
[SPEAKER_00]: 24 percentage points, so you know that would be for anyone who was there in kindergarten Starting that you know you need to be there two years to get this growth You know so it's kind of the consistency the building capacity in the school with the curriculum the alignment of

602
00:52:51,553 --> 00:52:57,136
[SPEAKER_00]: We started doing benchmark assessments with the students using journeys.

603
00:52:58,496 --> 00:53:01,497
[SPEAKER_00]: We had PLCs come across the district.

604
00:53:01,578 --> 00:53:04,499
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the Columbus teachers participated in that.

605
00:53:04,539 --> 00:53:08,200
[SPEAKER_00]: It was voluntary in year one where they would look at student data.

606
00:53:10,141 --> 00:53:12,862
[SPEAKER_00]: The assessments weren't for grading students.

607
00:53:13,022 --> 00:53:16,924
[SPEAKER_00]: It was for finding out what they know and what we need to reteach.

608
00:53:16,944 --> 00:53:18,725
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think they embraced that.

609
00:53:20,107 --> 00:53:21,527
[SPEAKER_00]: really brought that along.

610
00:53:21,948 --> 00:53:22,368
[SPEAKER_14]: That's great.

611
00:53:22,428 --> 00:53:26,849
[SPEAKER_14]: And you have a supplement to the curriculum for the English learners?

612
00:53:27,369 --> 00:53:27,649
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

613
00:53:27,789 --> 00:53:34,031
[SPEAKER_00]: So we embedded for the, we use the journeys as our curriculum for what we call our pullout students.

614
00:53:34,131 --> 00:53:36,032
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't use that with our newcomer students.

615
00:53:36,112 --> 00:53:39,073
[SPEAKER_00]: We might use bits and pieces of it in the newcomers program, but

616
00:53:40,378 --> 00:53:53,985
[SPEAKER_00]: We use, you know, they follow the journeys in their English class, and the English language development standards have been matched with the appropriate chapters and units and pacing guides with journeys.

617
00:53:54,465 --> 00:53:55,646
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, it's a good supplement.

618
00:53:55,666 --> 00:53:56,266
[SPEAKER_14]: It looks great.

619
00:53:56,747 --> 00:53:57,187
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

620
00:53:59,048 --> 00:53:59,908
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice Chair Rousseau.

621
00:54:00,048 --> 00:54:01,369
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you're all set.

622
00:54:01,609 --> 00:54:01,829
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

623
00:54:03,050 --> 00:54:04,731
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to accept the report.

624
00:54:06,402 --> 00:54:10,486
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion by School Committeewoman Van der Kloot, seconded by School Committeewoman Kreatz.

625
00:54:10,547 --> 00:54:11,227
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

626
00:54:11,928 --> 00:54:12,669
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

627
00:54:12,849 --> 00:54:13,430
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

628
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:13,850
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

629
00:54:15,572 --> 00:54:17,514
[SPEAKER_03]: Number five, report on credit for life.

630
00:54:17,854 --> 00:54:19,136
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Bernadette Riccidelli.

631
00:54:31,202 --> 00:54:38,031
[SPEAKER_04]: Good evening, Mayor Lungo-Koehn, Superintendent Edouard-Vincent, and members of the Medford School Committee.

632
00:54:38,632 --> 00:54:45,361
[SPEAKER_04]: So we are here tonight to announce the third annual Credit for Life Fair that will take place on April 3rd.

633
00:54:46,345 --> 00:54:50,346
[SPEAKER_04]: from 8.45 to 12.45 in the Medford High School gymnasium.

634
00:54:52,007 --> 00:54:55,728
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, this being our third year with the team.

635
00:54:56,109 --> 00:54:59,010
[SPEAKER_04]: So with me is Gail Trainor and Lisa Evangelista.

636
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:01,831
[SPEAKER_04]: The fourth member of our team is not here.

637
00:55:01,951 --> 00:55:05,932
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Kristen Kuhlen, who is the marketing teacher at the vocational school.

638
00:55:06,612 --> 00:55:13,515
[SPEAKER_04]: So as a team, the four of us have worked, again, this being our third year, and we think that

639
00:55:14,575 --> 00:55:17,358
[SPEAKER_04]: We think this is going to be our best year with the program.

640
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:21,903
[SPEAKER_04]: Like in the other years, we are the recipient of a grant.

641
00:55:22,063 --> 00:55:31,493
[SPEAKER_04]: This year it's $2,500, and the grant is made possible by the Division of Banks through the State Treasurer's Office.

642
00:55:32,814 --> 00:55:37,717
[SPEAKER_04]: The Credit for Life Fair is not our original idea, but we think we've made our mark on it.

643
00:55:38,837 --> 00:55:42,899
[SPEAKER_04]: Many schools in the Commonwealth do implement these Credit for Life Fairs.

644
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:53,685
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a way for students to authentically practice what it's like to be out in the real world with a budget and how to manage and balance costs.

645
00:55:54,645 --> 00:55:57,967
[SPEAKER_04]: Several of you have attended either last year or the prior year.

646
00:55:58,307 --> 00:56:00,388
[SPEAKER_04]: We hope you will consider attending again.

647
00:56:01,049 --> 00:56:02,209
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of you volunteered.

648
00:56:02,729 --> 00:56:03,970
[SPEAKER_04]: We really put you to work.

649
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:05,431
[SPEAKER_04]: I do remember that.

650
00:56:06,151 --> 00:56:12,875
[SPEAKER_04]: Others were observers and we want to extend that invitation to you again this year.

651
00:56:17,317 --> 00:56:24,098
[SPEAKER_04]: So one of the changes that we've made this year is we are asking all grade 11 students to participate this year.

652
00:56:24,539 --> 00:56:29,940
[SPEAKER_04]: So you may remember the first year we opened it to grades 11 and 12 students.

653
00:56:30,340 --> 00:56:34,561
[SPEAKER_04]: We made it voluntary but we had an overwhelming majority of students participate.

654
00:56:35,261 --> 00:56:42,342
[SPEAKER_04]: Last year we designated it as an 11th grade activity and we left it as a volunteer activity.

655
00:56:42,962 --> 00:56:44,963
[SPEAKER_04]: This year, given the importance of

656
00:56:46,485 --> 00:56:52,029
[SPEAKER_04]: what we think this program offers our students, we do want all grade 11 students to participate.

657
00:56:52,790 --> 00:56:54,051
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's our expectation.

658
00:56:54,471 --> 00:56:59,375
[SPEAKER_04]: So approximately 310 students will be part of the program.

659
00:57:00,650 --> 00:57:10,781
[SPEAKER_04]: Gayle Trainor has done immense work, and she will speak to you about the work she has done with the math teachers in the math classrooms.

660
00:57:12,443 --> 00:57:14,926
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be working with them very soon.

661
00:57:15,547 --> 00:57:17,449
[SPEAKER_04]: So at this point, Gayle, did you want to mention?

662
00:57:18,229 --> 00:57:41,615
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure, so we've last year we started coordinating with the math department and the math teachers for 11th grade to start About six weeks or a month before the fair incorporating some of the financial excuse me some of the financial Aspects that the students are the vocabulary as well as some of the formulas and things like that that they're going to need to know

663
00:57:42,098 --> 00:58:03,693
[SPEAKER_13]: when they do their budget sheet, so if you're not familiar with it, the students choose about a month and a half before the fair, they choose a profession, and with that profession comes a salary, and with that salary comes deductions, it's very real world, we don't have all the deductions that everybody has, but some, and they get a credit score,

664
00:58:04,656 --> 00:58:10,538
[SPEAKER_13]: And with that credit score come certain conditions on the loans that they're available to get.

665
00:58:10,858 --> 00:58:12,939
[SPEAKER_13]: They get a student loan payment, et cetera.

666
00:58:13,419 --> 00:58:19,321
[SPEAKER_13]: So they have to understand certain calculations and things like that.

667
00:58:19,381 --> 00:58:30,546
[SPEAKER_13]: So the math teachers have been great and very enthusiastic about presenting these concepts and making sure that the students understand them prior to coming to the fair.

668
00:58:30,586 --> 00:58:33,267
[SPEAKER_13]: Because if they don't, they're going to be very confused

669
00:58:34,968 --> 00:58:36,969
[SPEAKER_13]: We do offer credit counseling during the fair.

670
00:58:37,029 --> 00:58:37,469
[SPEAKER_13]: I think Ms.

671
00:58:37,489 --> 00:58:39,809
[SPEAKER_13]: Kreatz worked in credit counseling last year.

672
00:58:40,269 --> 00:58:47,812
[SPEAKER_13]: And some of them do take advantage of that because they realize that they're in trouble because they picked a new car over a bicycle or something like that.

673
00:58:47,852 --> 00:58:50,332
[SPEAKER_13]: So we do offer that as well.

674
00:58:50,352 --> 00:58:55,494
[SPEAKER_13]: But the math department, working with them, and then they give us feedback after that.

675
00:58:55,514 --> 00:58:57,674
[SPEAKER_13]: So they take their budget sheets back with them.

676
00:58:57,694 --> 00:58:58,575
[SPEAKER_13]: The first year we collected them.

677
00:59:00,701 --> 00:59:05,965
[SPEAKER_13]: Now we have them go back so they can sit in their math class and look and see, did they balance?

678
00:59:06,205 --> 00:59:07,366
[SPEAKER_13]: Where did they fall down?

679
00:59:07,727 --> 00:59:09,908
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, what concepts maybe they missed?

680
00:59:10,189 --> 00:59:24,920
[SPEAKER_13]: And the vocabulary that the volunteers use and that they're gonna be exposed to, the financial vocabulary, is going to also be very important because that's what they need to know to understand the various stations that they go through.

681
00:59:26,962 --> 00:59:27,222
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

682
00:59:28,282 --> 00:59:32,928
[SPEAKER_04]: So Lisa Evangelista is our public relations officer.

683
00:59:33,008 --> 00:59:36,633
[SPEAKER_04]: She's done a lot of outreach with the community volunteers.

684
00:59:37,494 --> 00:59:41,920
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think last year we had roughly 60 volunteers.

685
00:59:41,940 --> 00:59:44,944
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you wanted to say anything about that.

686
00:59:46,575 --> 00:59:49,519
[SPEAKER_11]: So this could not be done without the volunteers.

687
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:55,627
[SPEAKER_11]: We have sometimes 4 to sometimes 10, probably more than that at credit counseling.

688
00:59:56,247 --> 01:00:00,993
[SPEAKER_11]: And we'd have to stop having classes if we had all the teachers do it.

689
01:00:01,053 --> 01:00:03,436
[SPEAKER_11]: So the community comes out.

690
01:00:04,157 --> 01:00:16,729
[SPEAKER_11]: in mass and volunteers and host the tables that each student has to go by with their budget sheet before they can say that they've made their budget or not.

691
01:00:19,930 --> 01:00:23,153
[SPEAKER_11]: Without them, we wouldn't be able to host the fair.

692
01:00:23,253 --> 01:00:28,057
[SPEAKER_11]: So I know some of you on the school committee also were very helpful in the past couple of years.

693
01:00:28,157 --> 01:00:34,422
[SPEAKER_11]: So we'll be sending you out a little note soon to tell you when our volunteer meeting will be.

694
01:00:35,603 --> 01:00:37,124
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, it's April 3rd.

695
01:00:37,164 --> 01:00:41,288
[SPEAKER_11]: The events will probably have the volunteer meeting about a month prior.

696
01:00:43,350 --> 01:00:46,072
[SPEAKER_11]: But again, without them, they also provide

697
01:00:46,512 --> 01:00:48,033
[SPEAKER_11]: raffle prizes for the students.

698
01:00:49,454 --> 01:00:52,196
[SPEAKER_11]: So the community really does come together and they look forward to it.

699
01:00:52,496 --> 01:00:58,940
[SPEAKER_11]: They've actually started a smaller version of the program in the middle schools, which started today at the McGlynn.

700
01:00:59,380 --> 01:01:04,283
[SPEAKER_11]: Both Brookline Bank is working with Members Plus, just giving them a very basic

701
01:01:06,104 --> 01:01:10,486
[SPEAKER_11]: outline of how to save money and how important that is.

702
01:01:11,466 --> 01:01:19,630
[SPEAKER_11]: Many of them are not working yet, but they are doing small jobs like shoveling or cleaning up for their neighbor or even babysitting.

703
01:01:19,790 --> 01:01:26,293
[SPEAKER_11]: So it was a nice experience this morning at the McGlynn, and they will be at the Andrews tomorrow for that.

704
01:01:26,413 --> 01:01:32,975
[SPEAKER_11]: So definitely we're moving forward and making sure that we start young and continue at the high school level.

705
01:01:33,496 --> 01:01:33,896
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.

706
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:42,045
[SPEAKER_06]: School committee woman Kreatz hi, thank you very much for the report, and I definitely look forward to the

707
01:01:42,378 --> 01:01:45,900
[SPEAKER_06]: fair again this year, and I would love to volunteer, so you can put me down.

708
01:01:46,821 --> 01:01:47,401
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.

709
01:01:47,421 --> 01:01:52,865
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's great to hear that the bank was out to speak to the students.

710
01:01:53,625 --> 01:01:57,748
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I was talking about that over the last couple of years.

711
01:01:58,589 --> 01:02:07,535
[SPEAKER_06]: Some students, and even my own son had come to me when he got out of high school, and he didn't know how to write a check or what to do with his bank account.

712
01:02:08,642 --> 01:02:22,214
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was wondering if that's something that we could do for the high school seniors, just adding a presentation to invite maybe one of the local banks to come out and just do a brief demo on banking.

713
01:02:22,274 --> 01:02:29,321
[SPEAKER_06]: I know I attended at the vocational program, I think one of the students had come back and talked to

714
01:02:29,782 --> 01:02:40,403
[SPEAKER_06]: some of the students but I'm not sure like what bank it was but it was something like I've been you know kind of asking about for a while just you know writing a check you know

715
01:02:41,090 --> 01:02:47,654
[SPEAKER_06]: what's involved with going to the bank and what type of identification you need and protecting your PIN and things like that.

716
01:02:47,674 --> 01:02:58,580
[SPEAKER_06]: And just kind of throwing it out there if it's something that, not like right away, but like something that could be for maybe next year or something like that, just another seminar.

717
01:02:58,620 --> 01:02:59,981
[SPEAKER_06]: It wouldn't be the same day, obviously.

718
01:03:02,141 --> 01:03:07,742
[SPEAKER_06]: But no, thank you very much, and definitely, I'm sincere, and I just, definitely put me down for volunteer, for sure.

719
01:03:08,362 --> 01:03:08,762
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

720
01:03:08,982 --> 01:03:15,704
[SPEAKER_04]: So if I could just respond to that, we have two electives, one of the math department, one of the social studies department, both having to do with financial literacy.

721
01:03:16,744 --> 01:03:29,786
[SPEAKER_04]: Those classes are primarily comprised of 12th graders, so we chose grade 11 for this fair, and we can probably incorporate the check writing into the fair in some way,

722
01:03:30,553 --> 01:03:35,355
[SPEAKER_04]: But in those elective classes, certainly we can convey that to the teacher.

723
01:03:35,395 --> 01:03:36,655
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I believe that they do it.

724
01:03:37,096 --> 01:03:37,976
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I will double check.

725
01:03:38,216 --> 01:03:38,296
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

726
01:03:38,376 --> 01:03:39,437
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be great.

727
01:03:40,197 --> 01:03:40,757
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

728
01:03:40,797 --> 01:03:44,419
[SPEAKER_04]: Those electives are kind of on top of what we're doing this year with the program.

729
01:03:44,939 --> 01:03:45,359
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

730
01:03:46,659 --> 01:03:47,900
[SPEAKER_03]: School Committeewoman McLaughlin.

731
01:03:50,603 --> 01:03:52,265
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for the event and for the report.

732
01:03:53,086 --> 01:04:02,374
[SPEAKER_14]: And if community members are interested in volunteering, is it too soon for them to reach out or will you put that out, reach out to you, Lisa Evangelista, if people want to volunteer?

733
01:04:03,135 --> 01:04:03,996
[SPEAKER_14]: Great, thank you.

734
01:04:04,416 --> 01:04:08,420
[SPEAKER_14]: And thanks to the community members and the banks for being involved in this.

735
01:04:08,460 --> 01:04:09,441
[SPEAKER_14]: This looks like a really great

736
01:04:10,601 --> 01:04:10,882
[SPEAKER_14]: program.

737
01:04:10,922 --> 01:04:18,386
[SPEAKER_14]: I know that we went a few years ago and my daughter decided to change her career choice based on her budget, so thank you.

738
01:04:22,754 --> 01:04:24,736
[SPEAKER_15]: School Committee Woman, Vanda Kloot.

739
01:04:25,217 --> 01:04:27,339
[SPEAKER_15]: I just want to say thanks for your work on this.

740
01:04:27,399 --> 01:04:28,841
[SPEAKER_15]: I've been able to go for a couple of years.

741
01:04:28,901 --> 01:04:32,125
[SPEAKER_15]: This year I'll be able to volunteer for the whole period of time.

742
01:04:32,225 --> 01:04:33,767
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a great event and a lot of fun.

743
01:04:33,787 --> 01:04:39,674
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm particularly happy to hear too that you've been able to reach now into the middle schools with some activities there.

744
01:04:40,274 --> 01:04:40,575
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

745
01:04:40,715 --> 01:04:40,935
[SPEAKER_15]: Great.

746
01:04:41,656 --> 01:04:41,976
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

747
01:04:42,477 --> 01:04:43,338
[SPEAKER_16]: School Committee Woman, Graham.

748
01:04:45,030 --> 01:04:48,492
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks, I am hoping that I'll be able to be there as well, so I'll check my calendar.

749
01:04:49,592 --> 01:05:04,360
[SPEAKER_16]: One of the things that this makes me think about is sort of what do we already do when it comes to financial literacy at all levels of education in Medford, and I think there's a lot of

750
01:05:06,288 --> 01:05:12,893
[SPEAKER_16]: misinformation out there about what we do do, what we don't do, what other people do, what other people don't do.

751
01:05:12,913 --> 01:05:26,083
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think it would just be really nice for particularly parents that have younger children who haven't gone through the whole system yet to just understand something about how we approach financial literacy.

752
01:05:26,627 --> 01:05:32,970
[SPEAKER_16]: whether it's elementary school, middle school, or high school, and just give people a familiarity with what those structures are that exist today.

753
01:05:33,070 --> 01:05:42,434
[SPEAKER_16]: So I don't know if there's a way we can do some sort of update or some sort of press article about what our offering is from the beginning to the end.

754
01:05:42,494 --> 01:05:47,256
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that would be really valuable for lots of different people for lots of different reasons.

755
01:05:47,316 --> 01:05:50,957
[SPEAKER_16]: So just more a suggestion than anything, but I think it would be helpful.

756
01:05:52,018 --> 01:05:52,178
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.

757
01:05:56,789 --> 01:05:57,509
[SPEAKER_16]: Is that a motion or?

758
01:05:57,529 --> 01:05:57,569
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

759
01:05:59,730 --> 01:06:06,413
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd like to make a motion that we put out a press release that gives that sort of end-to-end perspective of financial literacy across the district.

760
01:06:07,974 --> 01:06:19,458
[SPEAKER_03]: So a motion by School Committeewoman Graham that we do a press article on financial literacy and what is offered, all levels of education in Medford.

761
01:06:19,778 --> 01:06:25,761
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion for approval by School Committeewoman Graham, seconded by School Committeewoman Kreatz.

762
01:06:25,781 --> 01:06:26,461
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

763
01:06:27,309 --> 01:06:28,050
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

764
01:06:28,590 --> 01:06:29,331
[SPEAKER_03]: Paper passes.

765
01:06:30,213 --> 01:06:32,295
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to receive and place on file.

766
01:06:34,759 --> 01:06:38,384
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you like to ask a question?

767
01:06:39,385 --> 01:06:39,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on up.

768
01:06:43,172 --> 01:06:44,013
[SPEAKER_16]: They want to hear you.

769
01:06:44,073 --> 01:06:45,633
[SPEAKER_16]: That's why we want you to talk into the microphone.

770
01:06:46,094 --> 01:06:47,955
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just first want to thank you.

771
01:06:48,455 --> 01:06:49,495
[SPEAKER_12]: Last year I participated.

772
01:06:49,535 --> 01:06:50,216
[SPEAKER_12]: It was really fun.

773
01:06:50,236 --> 01:06:52,477
[SPEAKER_12]: I learned a lot.

774
01:06:52,717 --> 01:06:53,978
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't go in debt.

775
01:06:54,418 --> 01:06:56,419
[SPEAKER_12]: A lot of my peers did.

776
01:06:56,579 --> 01:06:57,339
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's a good thing.

777
01:06:57,739 --> 01:06:59,520
[SPEAKER_12]: But I just had one.

778
01:06:59,821 --> 01:07:01,041
[SPEAKER_12]: Are seniors allowed to go again?

779
01:07:02,782 --> 01:07:04,683
[SPEAKER_12]: Or is it just for 11th graders this year?

780
01:07:05,484 --> 01:07:06,564
[SPEAKER_13]: Just 11th grade this year.

781
01:07:06,845 --> 01:07:07,765
[SPEAKER_12]: That's cool.

782
01:07:08,525 --> 01:07:25,112
[SPEAKER_12]: Second question, last year, like one of the big, like from my peers at least, one of the big things that we kind of talked about in math was like kind of the long, like the big crowds and the long lines at the end, with like the, like how are you guys gonna,

783
01:07:26,997 --> 01:07:28,398
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know, fix that, I guess?

784
01:07:28,518 --> 01:07:35,961
[SPEAKER_13]: We have a plan to adjust that, because we've actually met about that, because that was an issue last year at credit counseling.

785
01:07:36,022 --> 01:07:40,584
[SPEAKER_13]: So what we're doing is we're breaking out some of the tables, some of the areas.

786
01:07:42,305 --> 01:07:44,065
[SPEAKER_13]: Before, we had cell phone with utilities.

787
01:07:44,085 --> 01:07:49,248
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to break that out separately and have our stops at credit counseling in between, built in.

788
01:07:50,349 --> 01:07:50,809
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, OK.

789
01:07:50,949 --> 01:07:51,969
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I like that.

790
01:07:52,009 --> 01:07:52,109
[SPEAKER_12]: Great.

791
01:07:56,345 --> 01:08:03,990
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to receive on file but offered by Vice Chair Rousseau, seconded by Kathy Kreatz.

792
01:08:04,951 --> 01:08:05,692
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

793
01:08:06,292 --> 01:08:07,033
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

794
01:08:07,113 --> 01:08:08,354
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much, ladies.

795
01:08:11,336 --> 01:08:15,398
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a report on Medford Community Fund Awards by Ms.

796
01:08:15,699 --> 01:08:16,479
[SPEAKER_03]: Diane Caldwell.

797
01:08:17,420 --> 01:08:18,020
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening.

798
01:08:18,801 --> 01:08:19,241
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening.

799
01:08:19,942 --> 01:08:23,044
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have the distinct pleasure of announcing the 2019 recipients

800
01:08:25,107 --> 01:08:29,609
[SPEAKER_05]: of the 125,000 community fund payments from Encore Boston.

801
01:08:30,269 --> 01:08:36,052
[SPEAKER_05]: The fund tagline, All in Medford, AIM, hopes to have positive impact on Medford residents.

802
01:08:36,892 --> 01:08:49,338
[SPEAKER_05]: Many of the grants awarded will benefit the students and families of Medford Public Schools, including the Medford Educational Foundation, Friends of the Medford Family Network, PTOs in various schools, and the ME program.

803
01:08:50,078 --> 01:08:52,660
[SPEAKER_05]: I had the distinct pleasure of talking to Marie Cassidy.

804
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:54,520
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you all know the Energizer Bunny.

805
01:08:55,121 --> 01:09:00,563
[SPEAKER_05]: And she came into my office and was so excited by her ESOL award.

806
01:09:00,623 --> 01:09:03,845
[SPEAKER_05]: So she's working with English as a Second Language,

807
01:09:04,305 --> 01:09:17,371
[SPEAKER_05]: with our parents who need some extra help in learning English, so she was extremely happy about that, as well as Kathleen McGlynn Brady, who wanted to do some music therapy for our preschool students.

808
01:09:17,871 --> 01:09:30,136
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're going to pilot a program in our preschools to see, it's called Roman Music Therapy, and I'm going to be meeting with the person who actually started this on Friday this week, so I can't wait to do that as well.

809
01:09:32,032 --> 01:09:36,665
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to thank the PTO members who worked to submit the grants for the Chromebook.

810
01:09:37,477 --> 01:09:40,379
[SPEAKER_05]: The elementary principals are beside themselves with joy.

811
01:09:40,419 --> 01:09:42,120
[SPEAKER_05]: They're getting Chromebook cards.

812
01:09:42,140 --> 01:09:43,081
[SPEAKER_05]: They're very excited.

813
01:09:43,601 --> 01:09:45,683
[SPEAKER_05]: Each elementary school got approximately $7,600.

814
01:09:46,123 --> 01:09:54,669
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'd like to thank the work of the Citywide Elementary Alliance, which fundraised in collaboration.

819
01:10:53,830 --> 01:11:02,415

821
01:11:06,513 --> 01:11:12,576
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope you'll indulge me while I read these because I think it's very important that they get acknowledgement.

[SPEAKER_06]: Calzo for the report.

831
01:12:08,948 --> 01:12:16,851
[SPEAKER_06]: I did serve on the committee and it was all the applications, they were just so interesting and I wanted to give everybody something.

832
01:12:17,031 --> 01:12:27,415
[SPEAKER_06]: It was very difficult to make your decision and it was for the first time grant, we were able to give out 27 applicants and we had 37.

833
01:12:28,295 --> 01:12:33,877
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just wanna say, encourage anybody who is a nonprofit to

834
01:12:34,337 --> 01:12:36,698
[SPEAKER_06]: apply next year, put it on your calendar.

835
01:12:37,139 --> 01:12:39,260
[SPEAKER_06]: You can get anywhere between $1,000 to $10,000.

836
01:12:40,840 --> 01:12:52,827
[SPEAKER_06]: And the application should come out annually around, annually a little bit either on September 30th or a little bit after into October.

837
01:12:52,987 --> 01:12:57,169
[SPEAKER_06]: And just thank everybody for all their hard work in filling out the applications.

838
01:12:57,719 --> 01:13:06,412
[SPEAKER_06]: meeting the deadlines and they were all very interesting and everybody, you know, I wish I could give everybody something and, you know, I encourage you to apply again next year.

839
01:13:06,992 --> 01:13:07,333
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

840
01:13:09,825 --> 01:13:10,725
[SPEAKER_03]: Secretary Van der Kloot.

841
01:13:12,305 --> 01:13:19,267
[SPEAKER_15]: I just wanted to say that as a member of the Medford Education Foundation, I know that we were thrilled to receive our grant.

842
01:13:20,047 --> 01:13:31,769
[SPEAKER_15]: That money will, of course, be used for projects that teachers will submit to us, and we will go through our process to fund innovative and interesting projects that teachers have come up with.

843
01:13:32,309 --> 01:13:37,710
[SPEAKER_15]: And we were thrilled, and we wanted to thank Kathy as a member of the committee and the rest of the committee for their work.

844
01:13:38,850 --> 01:13:39,150
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

845
01:13:39,923 --> 01:13:41,505
[SPEAKER_15]: School committee, woman McLaughlin.

846
01:13:42,446 --> 01:13:44,208
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for this report.

847
01:13:44,248 --> 01:13:45,269
[SPEAKER_14]: This is very exciting.

848
01:13:45,289 --> 01:13:46,270
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

849
01:13:46,430 --> 01:13:48,473
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's so exciting to see all the folks listed here.

850
01:13:48,513 --> 01:13:58,744
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Kathy, for your work on this and for our other folks, Aaron and Neil and John and former Mayor Burke on this.

851
01:13:58,765 --> 01:13:59,045
[SPEAKER_14]: This is

852
01:13:59,788 --> 01:14:01,208
[SPEAKER_14]: Really great news from Medford.

853
01:14:02,229 --> 01:14:07,510
[SPEAKER_14]: I am wondering, I think, Kathy, I heard you say for nonprofits, for folks that want to apply next year.

854
01:14:07,590 --> 01:14:12,431
[SPEAKER_14]: So the requirement is that you do have to be a 501c3 nonprofit for these funds.

855
01:14:12,491 --> 01:14:12,992
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that right?

856
01:14:13,612 --> 01:14:13,812
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

857
01:14:14,232 --> 01:14:15,352
[SPEAKER_14]: OK.

858
01:14:15,812 --> 01:14:17,433
[SPEAKER_14]: So for anyone that wants to apply, they need that.

859
01:14:17,533 --> 01:14:22,994
[SPEAKER_14]: And then the call, how was the call for applications made for the RFP?

860
01:14:23,494 --> 01:14:24,835
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you know, or do you guys know?

861
01:14:25,195 --> 01:14:28,776
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just curious, how was the RFP for applications made?

862
01:14:34,543 --> 01:15:01,000
[SPEAKER_06]: Devaney she did the press release and it was on the website as soon as we had the it was a first-time application so we had to design it so as soon as the application was ready we put the press release out there and it was shared you know on Facebook all the social media and it was it was on the website that's how it was done thank you yep and then that then when we got the deadline date ready we posted that as well and

863
01:15:02,121 --> 01:15:07,108
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, I was really overwhelmed and surprised with how many applicants we got.

864
01:15:07,408 --> 01:15:08,770
[SPEAKER_06]: We didn't know how many we were going to get.

865
01:15:08,830 --> 01:15:11,253
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was really nice.

866
01:15:11,293 --> 01:15:12,174
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a nice turnout.

867
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:14,361
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, everybody did a great job.

868
01:15:14,882 --> 01:15:16,183
[SPEAKER_14]: It's fun to give money away.

869
01:15:16,203 --> 01:15:17,945
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I know it was.

870
01:15:18,365 --> 01:15:19,086
[SPEAKER_14]: Right, that's great.

871
01:15:19,126 --> 01:15:20,247
[SPEAKER_14]: Goes fast.

872
01:15:21,188 --> 01:15:29,996
[SPEAKER_14]: And then also for the Medford Family Network awards, the ESOL awards from Medford Family Network and also Kathleen McGlynn Brady's work with Roman Music Therapy.

873
01:15:30,196 --> 01:15:33,760
[SPEAKER_14]: We work with Roman Music Therapy often and Meredith is fantastic.

874
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:46,429
[SPEAKER_14]: And music is another language for so many of our children, and a lot of our children who don't communicate with words, especially, but also our English learners, all of our preschool children, everybody loves music.

875
01:15:46,489 --> 01:15:57,417
[SPEAKER_14]: So the music therapy is also really exciting, and I would encourage folks, once that program starts, to go and view that and see how the children really respond, because it's so good.

876
01:15:57,477 --> 01:15:58,018
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you.

877
01:15:58,417 --> 01:16:07,543
[SPEAKER_05]: So I hope you all remember that when budget time comes around and I'm requesting music therapy for our preschoolers, because they will benefit from that.

878
01:16:07,603 --> 01:16:08,664
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's great.

879
01:16:10,285 --> 01:16:10,585
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

880
01:16:11,365 --> 01:16:14,087
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to receive the report, place on file.

881
01:16:15,108 --> 01:16:18,670
[SPEAKER_03]: Moved by Secretary van de Kloot, seconded by Councilwoman Mustone.

882
01:16:18,730 --> 01:16:19,411
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

883
01:16:19,431 --> 01:16:19,491
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

884
01:16:20,171 --> 01:16:20,932
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

885
01:16:23,213 --> 01:16:24,194
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we have any old business?

886
01:16:27,635 --> 01:16:33,558
[SPEAKER_06]: Any questions about one of the reports that was provided?

887
01:16:33,578 --> 01:16:39,541
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was one of the old reports that was on the, I guess it was on the list of the back of the requested reports.

888
01:16:40,242 --> 01:16:44,684
[SPEAKER_06]: It was the report on mathematics middle school supplies.

889
01:16:46,225 --> 01:16:54,229
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just wanted to, while we're entering into the pre-budget season, this year I think we all heard from teachers who had to buy

890
01:16:54,930 --> 01:16:56,991
[SPEAKER_06]: supplies for manipulatives.

891
01:16:57,472 --> 01:16:59,053
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, it's hard to say that word for me.

892
01:16:59,473 --> 01:17:04,736
[SPEAKER_06]: Manipulatives such as dice, beads, blocks, measuring cups.

893
01:17:05,016 --> 01:17:22,828
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just want to make sure that going into the pre-budget season that we consider these items in the mathematics supplies department because teachers shouldn't have to go out and buy the supplies so that their students can do some of the experiments that they

894
01:17:23,885 --> 01:17:26,033
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, have to do as part of the curriculum.

895
01:17:27,257 --> 01:17:29,846
[SPEAKER_06]: I did hear that some of the students were asked to bring in

896
01:17:30,996 --> 01:17:37,997
[SPEAKER_06]: drink mixes so that they could measure the water in drink cups, and it would be able to see the different levels with different colors.

897
01:17:38,377 --> 01:17:58,702
[SPEAKER_06]: So I mean, they aren't very expensive things, but if we can just find a way to kind of maybe even ask for donations from people if they want to donate certain supplies, if there isn't enough money in the budget for the additional supplies, but we should really try to build something in the budget so that there's enough for the supplies.

898
01:17:59,482 --> 01:18:00,542
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to add that.

899
01:18:04,203 --> 01:18:13,727
[SPEAKER_03]: I take that as a motion to look into math supplies in the fiscal 2021 budget.

900
01:18:13,767 --> 01:18:17,889
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, just as we enter into the new upcoming pre-budget season.

901
01:18:17,909 --> 01:18:24,752
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion by School Committeewoman Kreatz, seconded by Secretary Van der Kloot.

902
01:18:24,772 --> 01:18:25,532
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

903
01:18:26,133 --> 01:18:26,793
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

904
01:18:26,853 --> 01:18:27,593
[SPEAKER_03]: Paper passes.

905
01:18:28,173 --> 01:18:28,874

906
01:18:28,894 --> 01:18:30,454
[SPEAKER_03]: None.

907
01:18:30,494 --> 01:18:30,695
[SPEAKER_03]: None.

908
01:18:30,975 --> 01:18:31,475
[SPEAKER_03]: New business?

909
01:18:32,395 --> 01:18:38,283
[SPEAKER_03]: Number one, request to present new options for agenda formatting, which was tabled on January 6, 2020.

910
01:18:38,343 --> 01:18:39,244
[SPEAKER_03]: Secretary Van der Kloot.

911
01:18:46,927 --> 01:18:58,556
[SPEAKER_15]: This was an item which came up when we had a meeting initially with the school committee members and questions of whether we could have a more efficient agenda.

912
01:18:59,016 --> 01:19:05,621
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that this should go to the subcommittee on rules and regulations, so I'd make a motion to send it there.

913
01:19:06,382 --> 01:19:11,525
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion by Secretary Van der Kloot, seconded by Councilwoman Mustone.

[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

01:19:14,127 --> 01:19:14,828

920
01:19:35,210 --> 01:19:40,954
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Vincent Zampel.

921
01:19:41,548 --> 01:19:47,213

922
01:19:47,914 --> 01:19:56,882
[SPEAKER_03]: It is noted in the Medford Historical Society that Vincent Zampel was the last Medford student to be drafted in World War II prior to graduating from Medford High School.

923
01:19:56,902 --> 01:19:59,365
[SPEAKER_03]: If we all may rise for a moment of silence.
