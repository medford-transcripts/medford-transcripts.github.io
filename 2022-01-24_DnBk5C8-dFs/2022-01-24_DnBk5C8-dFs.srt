00:02:12,587 --> 00:02:21,553
[SPEAKER_13]: Today is January 24th, which the United Nations deemed in 2018 as the International Day of Education.

48
00:02:58,675 --> 00:03:03,298
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd like to share this evening on behalf of our community partner, Project Bread.

[SPEAKER_13]: There have been policy changes made to SNAP, and we hope that our families will take the time to check it out at gettingsnap.org.

51
00:03:22,284 --> 00:03:35,932
[SPEAKER_13]: SNAP helps households meet nutritional and dietary needs, enables households to purchase food that is healthy and culturally appropriate, and supports low-wage households.

52
00:03:39,925 --> 00:03:49,773
[SPEAKER_13]: On a different note, I would like to add a special congratulations and share a very special happy birthday to Ms.

55
00:04:06,216 --> 00:04:06,436
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

56
00:04:06,456 --> 00:04:11,839
[SPEAKER_13]: Jenny, as she is affectionately called, has the energy of an elementary age student.

57
00:04:13,179 --> 00:04:17,821
[SPEAKER_13]: And she was a bright light and busy bee at the Brooks Elementary School.

58
00:04:18,862 --> 00:04:24,985
[SPEAKER_13]: She is a beloved member of the school community, and we appreciate her willingness to support our students.

59
00:04:25,785 --> 00:04:26,945
[SPEAKER_13]: So happy birthday, Ms.

60
00:04:26,986 --> 00:04:27,266
[SPEAKER_13]: Jenny.

61
00:04:27,286 --> 00:04:30,087
[SPEAKER_13]: 90 is a wonderful accomplishment.

72
00:05:50,408 --> 00:06:02,557
[SPEAKER_13]: While the COVID vaccines are limited to staff and students only, the flu vaccines are state supplied and available for anyone, including uninsured adults.

73
00:06:04,017 --> 00:06:10,941
[SPEAKER_13]: My Friday message included the registration links, and they are located on the school blog as well.

74
00:06:12,822 --> 00:06:23,888
[SPEAKER_13]: This Thursday, January 27th, the Medford Family Network will be presenting a Zoom meeting with the topic, Keeping Kids Safe on the Internet.

81
00:07:18,192 --> 00:07:23,975

00:09:43,122 --> 00:09:53,648
[SPEAKER_13]: It is the year of the tiger, and those born during this year are predicted to be brave, competitive, unpredictable, and confident.

00:09:54,952 --> 00:10:03,834
[SPEAKER_13]: We express our wishes of good health and happiness to all of our Asian families and friends who celebrate the 16-day festival.

[SPEAKER_13]: Weeks is the founder and CEO of the Equity Process, and she is going to be working with Medford Public Schools on our equity audit, and Dr. Cushing, I'm gonna ask if you wouldn't mind

[SPEAKER_13]: putting up, she has a brief presentation to share with you regarding the work that she will do with us.

108
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:03,839
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

109
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:04,139
[SPEAKER_13]: Weeks?

110
00:11:07,941 --> 00:11:10,502
[SPEAKER_13]: They will turn it on, I believe, in the, thank you.

111
00:11:10,902 --> 00:11:12,042
[SPEAKER_07]: It's on right now.

112
00:11:12,522 --> 00:11:16,824
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

113
00:11:17,064 --> 00:11:24,627
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for having me this evening, and I'll just give you a brief presentation of what we expect to do in Medford.

114
00:11:24,647 --> 00:11:27,268
[SPEAKER_16]: So first of all,

115
00:11:30,332 --> 00:11:34,433
[SPEAKER_16]: If you can take a look at the screen, and I'm sure you already know, but this is our mission.

116
00:11:37,553 --> 00:11:38,453
[SPEAKER_16]: Next slide, please.

117
00:11:39,734 --> 00:11:40,194
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

118
00:11:40,854 --> 00:11:42,334
[SPEAKER_16]: This is our mission and vision.

119
00:11:42,714 --> 00:11:47,875
[SPEAKER_16]: Pretty much we're here to help diversify the school place, and that diversity does not end at race.

120
00:11:48,175 --> 00:11:55,676
[SPEAKER_16]: It continues on to ethnicities and abilities and genders and sex and all the gamut, runs the whole gamut.

121
00:11:55,736 --> 00:11:58,757
[SPEAKER_16]: Currently, we'll be looking at your HR system within the school.

122
00:11:59,377 --> 00:12:03,238
[SPEAKER_16]: to see if there are any ways that we can help enhance the work that you're already doing.

123
00:12:03,719 --> 00:12:12,042
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're not here to shine a light and say, oh, no, no, it's really to help you progress into 21st century learning with the best HR practices that are out there.

124
00:12:13,982 --> 00:12:14,823
[SPEAKER_16]: Next slide, please.

125
00:12:15,183 --> 00:12:16,103
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Pierre.

126
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:19,655
[SPEAKER_16]: Humanity over politics is where I stand.

127
00:12:20,075 --> 00:12:21,595
[SPEAKER_16]: I really don't get into politics.

128
00:12:21,675 --> 00:12:23,616
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't watch the news.

129
00:12:23,696 --> 00:12:25,776
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't really read too much of the newspaper.

130
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:30,337
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm a person of compassion and I feel like together we can solve these issues.

131
00:12:30,837 --> 00:12:32,998
[SPEAKER_16]: It's really not all the other stuff that's out there.

132
00:12:33,038 --> 00:12:46,341
[SPEAKER_16]: So when I say humanity over politics, I really mean that it's nothing that I can do alone or my organization can do by itself, but everyone comes together collaboratively for the betterment of all students, because that's why we're here.

133
00:12:47,381 --> 00:12:48,502
[SPEAKER_16]: Next slide, please, Peter.

134
00:12:51,444 --> 00:12:55,788
[SPEAKER_16]: I usually use a lot of words for this, but I decided that I should use a visual.

135
00:12:56,548 --> 00:12:58,290
[SPEAKER_16]: What does the equity audit look like?

136
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:14,522
[SPEAKER_16]: What it really looks like is us just doing a lot of work, so combing through tons and tons of policies and procedures and practices and talking to people, and that's to facilitate discussions and the focus groups and surveys and really checking to see

137
00:13:15,082 --> 00:13:19,547
[SPEAKER_16]: which patterns emerge, what is already there, what isn't there, how can we enhance?

138
00:13:20,087 --> 00:13:22,730
[SPEAKER_16]: That's us just doing the work.

139
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:26,293
[SPEAKER_16]: But what it does not look like is the next slide, please, Peter.

140
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:30,579
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, sorry, this is still what it looks like.

141
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:35,743
[SPEAKER_16]: So I took a look at this report from Stanford University, written in April 2021.

142
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:53,293
[SPEAKER_16]: And it really gets into like the pieces of the audit that looks at diversity and leadership, community engagement, HR policies, where's where I will be right now, engaging like the culture of the community and not just the school, as well as learning and development.

143
00:13:54,114 --> 00:13:54,714
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Peter.

144
00:13:54,754 --> 00:13:55,535
[SPEAKER_16]: Next slide, please.

145
00:13:57,023 --> 00:13:59,206
[SPEAKER_16]: Here's the one where it does not look like.

146
00:13:59,927 --> 00:14:07,216
[SPEAKER_16]: This is quite interesting because usually once reports are done, people will ask a lot of questions like where's this, where's that, where's the next, where's the third.

147
00:14:07,997 --> 00:14:13,765
[SPEAKER_16]: It is not a scientific method by any means, so I don't want you to believe that I'm coming in here and

148
00:14:14,285 --> 00:14:16,407
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going to do this scientific experience.

149
00:14:16,467 --> 00:14:17,307
[SPEAKER_16]: That's not what it is.

150
00:14:17,367 --> 00:14:27,395
[SPEAKER_16]: It's really looking at your data very closely and seeing what matters to the city of Medford, the public of Medford, the community of Medford and the schools.

151
00:14:27,735 --> 00:14:29,817
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's tying all those pieces together.

152
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:32,378
[SPEAKER_16]: We will not have a research topic.

153
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:39,684
[SPEAKER_16]: That's why it's not a scientific experiment because we have our own expertise in this area, but we're not researching a specific topic.

154
00:14:40,744 --> 00:14:42,385
[SPEAKER_16]: You will not have a hypothesis.

155
00:14:42,445 --> 00:14:44,845
[SPEAKER_16]: That's not cool at all for this kind of work.

156
00:14:44,865 --> 00:14:49,147
[SPEAKER_16]: What we're doing is really allowing the data to write the script or the narrative.

157
00:14:49,207 --> 00:14:50,907
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's what your data shows us.

158
00:14:51,487 --> 00:14:53,288
[SPEAKER_16]: And there is no test or experiment.

159
00:14:53,388 --> 00:14:54,068
[SPEAKER_16]: It is what it is.

160
00:14:54,088 --> 00:14:55,148
[SPEAKER_16]: This is what your data says.

161
00:14:55,789 --> 00:14:58,169
[SPEAKER_16]: Here's the information, and here are our recommendations.

162
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:00,250
[SPEAKER_16]: Next slide, please, Frida.

163
00:15:03,051 --> 00:15:05,052
[SPEAKER_16]: simply stated, how do we do all this?

164
00:15:05,092 --> 00:15:08,292
[SPEAKER_16]: We aim first to get to know everyone that we come in contact with.

165
00:15:09,013 --> 00:15:14,194
[SPEAKER_16]: There'll be an opportunity for school committee members if you are interested to volunteer and do one-on-one interviews.

166
00:15:14,654 --> 00:15:19,495
[SPEAKER_16]: You don't have to do them, but I feel that your voice is utterly important, so you'll have that opportunity.

167
00:15:20,196 --> 00:15:25,257
[SPEAKER_16]: We will interview folks in HR and the leadership team, and we'll interview Maurice,

168
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:30,398
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll also give an opportunity for unsolicited information to be included.

169
00:15:30,918 --> 00:15:36,519
[SPEAKER_16]: When we do audits, people tend to email me all sorts of stuff, so we take that into consideration.

170
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:43,401
[SPEAKER_16]: We look at the implicit bias tools that you're currently using and think, are there any that we should be using?

171
00:15:44,121 --> 00:15:44,801
[SPEAKER_16]: Things like that.

172
00:15:44,821 --> 00:15:48,542
[SPEAKER_16]: Handbook, right at the bottom you'll see handbook, employee handbook, union handbook.

173
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:52,991
[SPEAKER_16]: content level curriculum, behavioral policies.

174
00:15:53,051 --> 00:15:58,733
[SPEAKER_16]: How does our work impact children and what is the relationship that we have with kids every day?

175
00:15:58,753 --> 00:16:02,474
[SPEAKER_16]: Not just face-to-face relationships, but also on paper.

176
00:16:04,435 --> 00:16:05,635
[SPEAKER_16]: Next slide, please, Peter.

177
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:11,653
[SPEAKER_16]: And this is probably, okay, I'll be, I'm telling you, I'm a little biased right now.

178
00:16:11,713 --> 00:16:18,775
[SPEAKER_16]: This is my favorite part, where I ask this question, what might a great experience look like for all students in Medford and not just some?

179
00:16:19,196 --> 00:16:28,939
[SPEAKER_16]: Because we know that there are some students that are doing really, really well and some students that are not doing well, but my job is to figure out how can we all come together and help all students do well?

180
00:16:30,099 --> 00:16:32,420
[SPEAKER_16]: You don't have to answer that question, but food for thought.

181
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:44,447
[SPEAKER_16]: And how do we ensure, because it is our responsibility as well, including mine, even though I'm not a resident of Medford, how do we ensure and embrace the notion of students in minority populations?

182
00:16:44,507 --> 00:16:50,330
[SPEAKER_16]: So once again, I'm not just here for race, I'm here for students in all minority populations.

183
00:16:50,790 --> 00:17:02,117
[SPEAKER_16]: So I put a little caveat there, BIPOCs, L, students with disability, LGBTQIA++, students from varied ethnicities and religions outside of the dominant culture.

184
00:17:02,657 --> 00:17:03,238
[SPEAKER_16]: and many others.

185
00:17:03,298 --> 00:17:08,904
[SPEAKER_16]: So how can we ensure that they feel safe and actualize their vision of success too?

186
00:17:09,384 --> 00:17:10,065
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm an immigrant.

187
00:17:10,185 --> 00:17:11,146
[SPEAKER_16]: I come from Barbados.

188
00:17:11,206 --> 00:17:12,327
[SPEAKER_16]: I came here when I was five.

189
00:17:12,988 --> 00:17:15,030
[SPEAKER_16]: America is so vastly different from Barbados.

190
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:16,492
[SPEAKER_16]: I had all my education here.

191
00:17:16,912 --> 00:17:21,937
[SPEAKER_16]: UMass Boston, my bachelor's degree, my master's from Simmons College, which is now Simmons University.

192
00:17:22,738 --> 00:17:25,759
[SPEAKER_16]: and lots of, you know, professional development going forward.

193
00:17:26,299 --> 00:17:33,002
[SPEAKER_16]: One thing I can tell you about Barbados is this little, if you don't know, it's a tiny, tiny, itsy bitsy country with a hundred percent literacy.

194
00:17:33,442 --> 00:17:34,622
[SPEAKER_16]: So it baffles me.

195
00:17:34,782 --> 00:17:38,364
[SPEAKER_16]: How does grand America not have a hundred percent literacy?

196
00:17:38,764 --> 00:17:40,024
[SPEAKER_16]: How do we have homelessness?

197
00:17:40,084 --> 00:17:41,625
[SPEAKER_16]: How do we not support one another?

198
00:17:41,665 --> 00:17:44,846
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's just ingrained within me to do this work.

199
00:17:45,486 --> 00:17:50,508
[SPEAKER_16]: And I really want to make sure that students can have the choice when they graduate from high school.

200
00:17:51,388 --> 00:17:57,794
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's not us telling you, well, you're going to go to college, you're going to do a trade or I don't know, you're going to be a vagrant on the street.

201
00:17:57,834 --> 00:17:58,875
[SPEAKER_16]: That's not our job.

202
00:17:58,975 --> 00:18:02,158
[SPEAKER_16]: Our job is to give them the best so that they can have choices.

203
00:18:02,258 --> 00:18:04,520
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's critically why I'm here today.

204
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,482
[SPEAKER_16]: And I will end with this last slide, please, Peter.

205
00:18:09,504 --> 00:18:12,907
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you have any questions that I can answer for you?

206
00:18:14,588 --> 00:18:15,229
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Peter.

207
00:18:17,851 --> 00:18:18,412
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Paul.

208
00:18:19,295 --> 00:18:21,697
[SPEAKER_05]: And there are so thank you thank you for the presentation.

209
00:18:23,139 --> 00:18:24,200
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for the presentation.

210
00:18:25,161 --> 00:18:35,170
[SPEAKER_12]: So I certainly understand my HR is sort of the first thing here is there a plan to keep coming.

211
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:37,971
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, HR isn't the whole shebang.

212
00:18:39,191 --> 00:18:48,354
[SPEAKER_12]: I get that it's sort of like a critical step, because it's like how we get our people, or even how we treat our people.

213
00:18:48,834 --> 00:18:49,814
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a lot about that.

214
00:18:49,894 --> 00:18:59,857
[SPEAKER_12]: But is it too soon, having not done this yet for HR, to know what the next step is, or have you been engaged for a next step?

215
00:19:00,675 --> 00:19:09,022
[SPEAKER_16]: So the next steps is truly up to, I just say, Maurice, I don't know what your technical terms are, so forgive me not being disrespectful.

216
00:19:09,042 --> 00:19:14,407
[SPEAKER_16]: But the next steps is for you and her to have a conversation to see how deep you want to go with the equity audit.

217
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:20,452
[SPEAKER_16]: But since it's such a large district, when her and I talked, we thought it would be best to start in pieces.

218
00:19:20,812 --> 00:19:24,796
[SPEAKER_16]: And HR was the first place to start, because we don't have the right people, right?

219
00:19:25,436 --> 00:19:27,897
[SPEAKER_16]: in front of students and how do we begin to move the work.

220
00:19:28,537 --> 00:19:30,718
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's really about 21st century learning.

221
00:19:30,758 --> 00:19:33,619
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're not saying like, Oh, it's so bad right now.

222
00:19:33,659 --> 00:19:37,921
[SPEAKER_16]: What we're saying is what does the future need for our students to be successful?

223
00:19:38,261 --> 00:19:39,882
[SPEAKER_16]: And is it currently here right now?

224
00:19:40,002 --> 00:19:42,943
[SPEAKER_16]: And if it's not, what do we need to do to ensure that it's here?

225
00:19:43,904 --> 00:19:44,224
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

226
00:19:44,424 --> 00:19:44,984
[SPEAKER_08]: You're welcome.

227
00:19:49,526 --> 00:19:51,186
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much for the presentation.

228
00:19:51,727 --> 00:19:52,487
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, member of Graham.

229
00:19:53,363 --> 00:19:53,783
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

230
00:19:53,803 --> 00:19:58,885
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, I had a couple of questions as, as I was looking through this.

231
00:19:58,905 --> 00:20:19,174
[SPEAKER_15]: So when you say this, the scope of this initial piece is HR, can you give us a sense of what that means to you in terms of the things and systems and types of procedures that you are going to be looking at in this phase?

232
00:20:19,672 --> 00:20:21,053
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for that question.

233
00:20:21,193 --> 00:20:25,777
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to tell you what it means to me is absolutely nothing because I come in with a blind eye.

234
00:20:25,797 --> 00:20:31,402
[SPEAKER_16]: So however you have defined human resources in Medford, that's where I begin.

235
00:20:31,442 --> 00:20:34,124
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's not my definition of human resources.

236
00:20:34,184 --> 00:20:36,186
[SPEAKER_16]: It's your definition of human resources.

237
00:20:36,606 --> 00:20:39,569
[SPEAKER_16]: We begin to look at policies and practices and procedures.

238
00:20:39,929 --> 00:20:42,711
[SPEAKER_16]: When I say policies, I mean, we're looking at school committee policies.

239
00:20:43,052 --> 00:20:44,513
[SPEAKER_16]: We're looking at HR policies.

240
00:20:44,798 --> 00:20:46,680
[SPEAKER_16]: We're looking at the overall school policies.

241
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,681
[SPEAKER_16]: We're looking at handbooks for every single school.

242
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:52,645
[SPEAKER_16]: We're looking at like, how do you do your hiring and retention?

243
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:58,650
[SPEAKER_16]: We're looking at who has left when it comes to people in the minority population.

244
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:01,872
[SPEAKER_16]: Why haven't you retained them or how have you retained them?

245
00:21:01,912 --> 00:21:03,674
[SPEAKER_16]: So those are the things we begin to look at.

246
00:21:03,714 --> 00:21:08,398
[SPEAKER_16]: We look at the mission and the vision of the school, but we also look at the mission and the vision for

247
00:21:08,838 --> 00:21:10,941
[SPEAKER_16]: human resources as a whole.

248
00:21:11,081 --> 00:21:15,426
[SPEAKER_16]: So there are a lot of pieces that we tend to look for, and we look at those in certain ways.

249
00:21:15,506 --> 00:21:18,850
[SPEAKER_16]: We look through the papers, what you have to present to me.

250
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:25,117
[SPEAKER_16]: We also ask certain questions when we begin to do facilitated discussions, like focus groups and interviews.

251
00:21:25,978 --> 00:21:27,199
[SPEAKER_16]: Did that answer the question?

252
00:21:28,701 --> 00:21:29,101
[SPEAKER_15]: Sort of.

253
00:21:30,381 --> 00:21:40,013
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think the question maybe is for Dr. Edward-Vincent, how has HR been defined here in Medford Public Schools for this equity audit to be completed?

254
00:21:40,794 --> 00:21:43,777
[SPEAKER_15]: Like what is the definition we're working against?

255
00:21:44,518 --> 00:21:48,603
[SPEAKER_13]: So right now, from an HR perspective,

256
00:21:50,018 --> 00:22:00,567
[SPEAKER_13]: One of the challenges we face here in Medford is that it is very difficult to recruit and retain diverse candidates.

257
00:22:00,988 --> 00:22:06,532
[SPEAKER_13]: So that is kind of like one of the elephants in the room that we are very, very aware of.

258
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:24,485
[SPEAKER_13]: So we are looking at the current practices of where are we finding candidates, where are we recruiting them from, coming up with additional potential partners that can help us diversify our staffing when there are, you know, open positions.

259
00:22:25,406 --> 00:22:33,812
[SPEAKER_13]: And the retention piece, which was mentioned earlier, that we have hired some BIPOC candidates or candidates of color and

260
00:22:34,292 --> 00:22:39,618
[SPEAKER_13]: they may stay one year or two years and then they choose not to stay.

261
00:22:39,998 --> 00:22:46,305
[SPEAKER_13]: So that is a question, another opportunity becomes available and they take that opportunity.

262
00:22:46,786 --> 00:22:53,733
[SPEAKER_13]: So trying to unpack like the why is there, is there something that we're not aware of that

263
00:22:55,415 --> 00:23:15,379
[SPEAKER_13]: could make Medford less attractive than what we and so if that is the case what do we need to do as a district to make it more attractive and try to think about further bringing greater diversity to the school system and so as a starting point it's the reason us

264
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:21,041
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, this person isn't doing this thing in human resources, but it's more like, what are we doing?

265
00:23:21,522 --> 00:23:23,162
[SPEAKER_13]: And then what else could we be doing?

266
00:23:23,763 --> 00:23:30,646
[SPEAKER_13]: And presenting us with other opportunities to be able to better recruit and retain.

267
00:23:30,806 --> 00:23:38,150
[SPEAKER_13]: We do have two other groups that we're trying to work with, but we still haven't been able to get the traction yet.

268
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:42,131
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're trying, but we're just not getting

269
00:23:43,472 --> 00:23:44,953
[SPEAKER_13]: the traction that we're hoping to get.

270
00:23:45,073 --> 00:23:52,478
[SPEAKER_13]: So by having the audit start in human resources and also in light of the pandemic.

271
00:23:53,919 --> 00:24:00,383
[SPEAKER_13]: And again, we just were in the process on the tail end now of this surge that we just were dealing with.

272
00:24:00,523 --> 00:24:02,205
[SPEAKER_13]: We were like, where can we start?

273
00:24:04,225 --> 00:24:10,128
[SPEAKER_13]: and not have an impact of going in and out of all of the classroom, in and out of all of the schools right now.

274
00:24:10,609 --> 00:24:19,014
[SPEAKER_13]: So hoping to do this first phase, get a really strong piece of data and information to help us move forward as a district.

275
00:24:19,034 --> 00:24:30,761
[SPEAKER_13]: So that was the thinking and the strategy behind starting with human resources and looking at recruitment and retention strategies.

276
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:32,462
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

277
00:24:33,423 --> 00:24:33,924
[SPEAKER_15]: That helps.

278
00:24:34,124 --> 00:24:38,867
[SPEAKER_15]: And I guess the other question I had is when you say we, who do you mean?

279
00:24:39,428 --> 00:24:47,353
[SPEAKER_15]: And was the racial equity task force involved in the like scope selection here, or is this something that the administration has decided?

280
00:24:47,874 --> 00:24:51,557
[SPEAKER_13]: So this, the racial equity task force has

281
00:24:53,543 --> 00:24:58,785
[SPEAKER_13]: weighed in and expressed their concern and their support of us doing an equity audit.

282
00:24:59,386 --> 00:25:21,835
[SPEAKER_13]: This particular focus right now in terms of mid-pandemic and wanting to start the work, the administration made the final decision with the equity process to start here right now, even though it's still mid-pandemic, but start the work instead of saying we have to wait another year to start again because

283
00:25:23,135 --> 00:25:24,196
[SPEAKER_13]: We have to start somewhere.

284
00:25:24,276 --> 00:25:27,458
[SPEAKER_13]: We can't pretend that the work doesn't need to happen.

285
00:25:28,339 --> 00:25:28,559
[SPEAKER_15]: Sure.

286
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:32,902
[SPEAKER_15]: And can you just tell us how long you expect this work to take in this first phase?

287
00:25:33,263 --> 00:25:38,687
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, so in the first phase, I'm expecting we're going to start this week.

288
00:25:38,907 --> 00:25:40,228
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, we're going to start this week.

289
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:40,448
[SPEAKER_16]: Wow.

290
00:25:41,444 --> 00:25:43,246
[SPEAKER_16]: Excuse me, I'm going through some stuff personally.

291
00:25:43,306 --> 00:25:45,428
[SPEAKER_16]: My father, my husband's mom passed away.

292
00:25:45,448 --> 00:25:49,852
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're going to start this week and we expect to be done by May.

293
00:25:50,012 --> 00:25:53,756
[SPEAKER_16]: So by May, we will have a report for you at the minute maximum.

294
00:25:54,216 --> 00:25:56,598
[SPEAKER_16]: It may be even sooner depending upon the documents.

295
00:25:57,159 --> 00:26:04,446
[SPEAKER_16]: And I just want to preface that, though that may be the case for Medford, when we go in, we may find more than that.

296
00:26:04,866 --> 00:26:06,088
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll be looking at everything.

297
00:26:07,002 --> 00:26:11,645
[SPEAKER_16]: and maybe how do we support our teachers or staff who have disabilities?

298
00:26:11,705 --> 00:26:13,006
[SPEAKER_16]: That may be a recommendation.

299
00:26:13,367 --> 00:26:16,729
[SPEAKER_16]: So it will not just be a recommendation on that alone.

300
00:26:16,769 --> 00:26:20,972
[SPEAKER_16]: You will have that information, but it is really looking at what is best for students.

301
00:26:21,292 --> 00:26:25,996
[SPEAKER_16]: And we know that diversity as a whole is best for students, but that is the focal point.

302
00:26:26,977 --> 00:26:27,237
[SPEAKER_15]: Awesome.

303
00:26:27,457 --> 00:26:28,518
[SPEAKER_15]: Very sorry for your loss.

304
00:26:28,638 --> 00:26:30,119
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks for the presentation.

305
00:26:30,219 --> 00:26:31,180
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, I couldn't remember.

306
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,321
[SPEAKER_06]: It's okay.

307
00:26:32,641 --> 00:26:33,121
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

308
00:26:34,322 --> 00:26:35,483
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Ruseau?

309
00:26:36,693 --> 00:26:37,314
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

310
00:26:37,634 --> 00:26:41,017
[SPEAKER_12]: Member Graham had asked a question that made me remember my other question.

311
00:26:42,258 --> 00:26:54,908
[SPEAKER_12]: Will we get your recommendations even if some of them are not the most solvable?

312
00:26:55,028 --> 00:26:58,972
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, if you come back and say, we can hire all of the

313
00:27:00,459 --> 00:27:05,463
[SPEAKER_12]: We can hire candidates that are of all kinds of diverse backgrounds.

314
00:27:06,263 --> 00:27:12,928
[SPEAKER_12]: They're going to move here from wherever they went to college and they're going to go to the W's and get a 25% pay raise.

315
00:27:13,128 --> 00:27:22,455
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to know, will you tell us if the problem, one of the major problems is that our pay is, I'm just making numbers up, is 10 or 15% too low.

316
00:27:23,095 --> 00:27:23,876
[SPEAKER_12]: You can do all you want.

317
00:27:23,916 --> 00:27:26,498
[SPEAKER_12]: You're never going to have a diversified staff because

318
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:44,453
[SPEAKER_12]: They're in demand and districts with money to burn or nobody has money to burn other than Cambridge, but other districts who have a higher pay scale are also looking and I don't for a second, of course, have any problems with staff going to find a place where they can get paid more.

319
00:27:45,534 --> 00:27:46,055
[SPEAKER_12]: That is a

320
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:51,162
[SPEAKER_12]: That's life, and that's what they should do if that's what they want.

321
00:27:51,262 --> 00:27:59,646
[SPEAKER_12]: But I want us to hear it, even if it puts us in an uncomfortable position when it's time to start our next negotiations for a contract.

322
00:27:59,726 --> 00:28:14,573
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, if you come here and say, your teacher pay is 15% too low, and I'm just making up a number, I want to hear it, because I want to be able to answer to the community who will be like, OK, you know,

323
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:23,262
[SPEAKER_12]: year two, year three, year four, and you're still have, you know, essentially an all white workforce, what's happening?

324
00:28:23,442 --> 00:28:40,269
[SPEAKER_12]: And the answer is, if part of the answer is we need to override to dramatically increase pay across the board, I'd like to know that instead of just imagining, you know, reading an ed report or comparing us to other towns by myself on the DESI documentation.

325
00:28:42,089 --> 00:28:45,311
[SPEAKER_12]: It'd be nice to have somebody who doesn't really have a stake in this.

326
00:28:46,232 --> 00:29:00,440
[SPEAKER_12]: to say, you can do all you want and you may have some success, but if a big root problem is your pay is not going to cut it, somebody has to tell us that other than me and other than the teachers union.

327
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:04,323
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, like we all have too much in this game.

328
00:29:04,343 --> 00:29:10,106
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not a game, but so will you tell us that even if it's a very uncomfortable truth?

329
00:29:11,219 --> 00:29:12,520
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, I will.

330
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,101
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a long way to ask that question.

331
00:29:14,341 --> 00:29:16,703
[SPEAKER_16]: I appreciate your candor just now.

332
00:29:17,003 --> 00:29:21,026
[SPEAKER_16]: And I loved your terminology and your example.

333
00:29:21,446 --> 00:29:22,907
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm here to tell you the truth.

334
00:29:23,228 --> 00:29:25,069
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm not here to make anything up.

335
00:29:25,149 --> 00:29:27,150
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm here to tell you what the data is telling you.

336
00:29:27,511 --> 00:29:28,831
[SPEAKER_16]: So the data will tell you the truth.

337
00:29:28,872 --> 00:29:29,932
[SPEAKER_16]: The data writes a script.

338
00:29:29,952 --> 00:29:31,273
[SPEAKER_16]: The data gives you the narrative.

339
00:29:31,914 --> 00:29:33,315
[SPEAKER_16]: And I give recommendations.

340
00:29:33,575 --> 00:29:34,956
[SPEAKER_16]: I can give a million recommendations.

341
00:29:34,996 --> 00:29:39,039
[SPEAKER_16]: But if you choose not to heed the recommendations, that is also your choice.

342
00:29:39,479 --> 00:29:40,720
[SPEAKER_16]: But it's going to be the truth.

343
00:29:41,173 --> 00:29:41,833
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you so much.

344
00:29:41,853 --> 00:29:43,554
[SPEAKER_16]: You're welcome and thanks for the question.

345
00:29:47,657 --> 00:29:48,297
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Mustone.

346
00:29:48,817 --> 00:29:49,998
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for being here tonight.

347
00:29:50,018 --> 00:29:50,678
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

348
00:29:51,238 --> 00:30:03,825
[SPEAKER_03]: The part about reviewing the instructional practices policies, anything written, do you like highlight it and say, this needs to be worked on and give us a revision or do you leave us to do the revisioning?

349
00:30:04,666 --> 00:30:06,247
[SPEAKER_16]: So the revisioning would come from you.

350
00:30:06,407 --> 00:30:08,568
[SPEAKER_16]: The recommendations may say something like,

351
00:30:09,493 --> 00:30:19,619
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know, hypothetically, I believe, it's not just me, I keep saying I, we believe when we read whatever, we saw A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and here's a recommendation.

352
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:23,941
[SPEAKER_16]: We believe that this recommendation will support fostering growth in this area.

353
00:30:24,422 --> 00:30:32,646
[SPEAKER_16]: However, the nitty gritty, the details, the details come from you all, and we would also recommend that you don't do it alone, but have a group of stakeholders.

354
00:30:33,126 --> 00:30:35,568
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's school committee, parents,

355
00:30:35,948 --> 00:30:38,469
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, leaders and children as well.

356
00:30:39,369 --> 00:30:46,250
[SPEAKER_16]: In this work, I don't know if this is a bias or not, but in this work, children tell the truth.

357
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:47,590
[SPEAKER_16]: They tell the story.

358
00:30:47,651 --> 00:30:48,711
[SPEAKER_16]: They tell us what they need.

359
00:30:49,151 --> 00:30:52,311
[SPEAKER_16]: And somehow along the way, we're losing that communication with them.

360
00:30:52,752 --> 00:30:57,033
[SPEAKER_16]: So I encourage us always to involve them in all of the stakeholder work.

361
00:30:57,053 --> 00:31:00,673
[SPEAKER_16]: They have to be a part of it because it's their lives, it's their future.

362
00:31:00,753 --> 00:31:03,934
[SPEAKER_16]: And I feel, we feel that they need to be a part of it.

363
00:31:04,913 --> 00:31:05,514
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for that.

364
00:31:05,554 --> 00:31:23,529
[SPEAKER_03]: So Dr. Maurice, do you think the recommendations that we are given by the equity process come May, would they go to the Racial Equity Committee to put them into action or will we address that later on?

365
00:31:23,996 --> 00:31:28,501
[SPEAKER_13]: So we definitely will be keeping the Race Equity Task Force updated.

366
00:31:29,162 --> 00:31:39,553
[SPEAKER_13]: Since this is specifically, even though we're going to get additional other information, they will be looped in this portion of the process of what we're being told about HR.

367
00:31:40,133 --> 00:31:45,099
[SPEAKER_13]: But I will definitely, when the whole process is completed, there will be

368
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:57,528
[SPEAKER_13]: a presentation to you, the committee, so you'll have what the recommendations are and what potential next steps are feasible at this point in time.

369
00:31:58,029 --> 00:32:04,013
[SPEAKER_13]: So that is definitely something that you will have before the school year is out.

370
00:32:04,033 --> 00:32:04,413
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

371
00:32:04,493 --> 00:32:04,853
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

372
00:32:05,514 --> 00:32:05,854
Thank you.

373
00:32:06,275 --> 00:32:06,755
[SPEAKER_03]: You're welcome.

374
00:32:06,835 --> 00:32:07,275
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

375
00:32:09,477 --> 00:32:10,057
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you so much.

376
00:32:10,438 --> 00:32:10,938
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Ms.

377
00:32:10,998 --> 00:32:11,278
[SPEAKER_07]: Weeks.

378
00:32:11,498 --> 00:32:12,379
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, everyone.

379
00:32:12,419 --> 00:32:12,859
[SPEAKER_16]: Stay safe.

380
00:32:12,879 --> 00:32:13,700
[SPEAKER_16]: Have a wonderful night.

381
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:13,980
[SPEAKER_16]: You too.

382
00:32:14,541 --> 00:32:14,901
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

383
00:32:17,405 --> 00:32:19,206
[SPEAKER_06]: Next, we have number three COVID update.

384
00:32:19,346 --> 00:32:30,030
[SPEAKER_06]: Assistant Superintendent of Finance and Operations, David Murphy and Avery Hines, Director of Health Services will report on operational updates and pending COVID shifts in the Metro Public School.

385
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:31,411
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Murphy, Ms.

386
00:32:31,431 --> 00:32:31,791
[SPEAKER_06]: Hines.

387
00:32:32,651 --> 00:32:33,151
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mayor.

388
00:32:33,712 --> 00:32:38,193
[SPEAKER_01]: On the screen is a document that we circulated

389
00:32:40,004 --> 00:32:42,947
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier this evening that I intend to walk you through tonight.

390
00:32:42,987 --> 00:32:43,087
[SPEAKER_01]: Ms.

391
00:32:43,107 --> 00:32:47,130
[SPEAKER_01]: Hines is available on the call as well for specific questions.

392
00:32:47,771 --> 00:32:56,058
[SPEAKER_01]: The superintendent mentioned in her opening comments this evening the success that we've had with our vaccination clinics running every Wednesday.

393
00:32:56,779 --> 00:32:59,181
[SPEAKER_01]: We intend to continue that through the month of February at least.

394
00:32:59,941 --> 00:33:07,448
[SPEAKER_01]: As I reported to you previously, our school nurses are phone banking both in addition to those clinics and while the clinics are happening.

395
00:33:08,451 --> 00:33:13,336
[SPEAKER_01]: and we are contacting both staff for purposes primarily for boosters.

396
00:33:13,356 --> 00:33:19,463
[SPEAKER_01]: A very limited number of unvaccinated staff at this point and also families who have not yet had their children vaccinated.

397
00:33:19,483 --> 00:33:25,210
[SPEAKER_01]: There have been some questions previously with the committee and I will get to the testing that's on the screen momentarily but just to

398
00:33:28,171 --> 00:33:35,397
[SPEAKER_01]: We know there have been some questions from the committee previously regarding in-school vaccinations.

399
00:33:36,217 --> 00:33:51,969
[SPEAKER_01]: We are looking at the week of February 14th, just prior to the school vacation, to attempt to administer in-school vaccination clinics, at least at the elementary schools and potentially at the Andrews Middle School as well.

400
00:33:52,850 --> 00:34:12,705
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be working with the principals over the course of the next week to identify a space so that parent or caregivers who want to come in to be with their, particularly with some of the younger children for a brief period during the day, just prior to and after the administration of the vaccines, we want to provide that option to families as best we can.

401
00:34:15,987 --> 00:34:16,828
[SPEAKER_01]: Closer to the microphone.

402
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:18,950
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize.

403
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:21,171
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know that I've ever been advised that before, so that's...

404
00:34:23,267 --> 00:34:24,808
[SPEAKER_01]: The blow's on, okay.

405
00:34:25,629 --> 00:34:29,772
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're looking for the vaccination clinics the week of February 14th to be in school.

406
00:34:30,953 --> 00:34:39,500
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll also have the app school portion for staff or people for whom it's more convenient, which we know for some families will probably be the case.

407
00:34:41,262 --> 00:34:56,967
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll take questions about the, any, any questions you have about the vaccine clinics, um, either now or after we walk through the testing, but tonight's update is focused more on some of the shifts and testing that have occurred or are going to occur, uh, based on information that we've received over the last two weeks.

408
00:34:57,527 --> 00:35:04,789
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll recall during our, uh, January or January 10th, uh, meeting, um, uh, Ms.

409
00:35:04,809 --> 00:35:09,671
[SPEAKER_01]: Hines and I discussed with you how, as some of the variables with the pandemic were changing,

410
00:35:10,468 --> 00:35:18,591
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a need for us to identify which variables we would need to change with regard to our testing protocols in order to keep the program sustainable.

411
00:35:18,771 --> 00:35:27,315
[SPEAKER_01]: And in that intervening time, DESE announced a program that districts across the Commonwealth, including Medford,

412
00:35:28,006 --> 00:35:36,572
[SPEAKER_01]: will be taking advantage of, and it is essentially the distribution of a large volume of rapid at-home tests.

413
00:35:37,452 --> 00:35:45,037
[SPEAKER_01]: And this really does mark a shift, as some of you have called with questions in the previous, over the course of the last week, it really does mark a shift of

414
00:35:46,837 --> 00:36:07,620
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of a moment in which what we have as an organization, the capacity to do on a more of a long-term basis, and I hope it's not long-term in terms of being measured in years, but it's something that we have the capacity to do more so than some of what we've been able to do over the course of the last year and a half.

415
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:19,742
[SPEAKER_01]: And over the course of this last surge, frankly, we've really seen some of the challenges that arise when the organization takes on things that it frankly does not really have the capacity to do.

416
00:36:20,642 --> 00:36:22,703
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've made some adjustments in recent weeks.

417
00:36:23,543 --> 00:36:25,964
[SPEAKER_01]: We transitioned to individual PCR testing.

418
00:36:26,764 --> 00:36:30,284
[SPEAKER_01]: That was necessary given the numbers and the positivity rate that we were seeing.

419
00:36:30,724 --> 00:36:32,745
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not something that is sustainable.

420
00:36:33,985 --> 00:36:51,103
[SPEAKER_01]: and we this week have transitioned back to pool testing and that we're one day into the return to pool testing but all reports are that it's gone well and obviously tomorrow we will see the return of the pool results that will determine its sustainability.

421
00:36:52,044 --> 00:36:56,569
[SPEAKER_01]: We intend to continue with the pooled PCR testing through the month of February.

422
00:36:57,130 --> 00:37:05,019
[SPEAKER_01]: However, we also intend to adopt the rapid at-home testing program that DESE has made available to districts.

423
00:37:06,767 --> 00:37:22,996
[SPEAKER_01]: In doing that, it does change some of our thinking with regard to how we ultimately step down our surveillance testing program, which, as we mentioned at the last meeting, is no longer the recommended course of action by the CDC and DPH.

424
00:37:23,597 --> 00:37:31,121
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as we transition, our plan is to go through a couple of different phases that will start with the

425
00:37:32,362 --> 00:37:37,749
[SPEAKER_01]: the reduction of the official contact tracing that we're still doing.

426
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:48,103
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll recall that we've mentioned before that the boards of health, including here in Medford, ceased contact tracing for the most part over this past summer, in the summer of 2021.

427
00:37:49,605 --> 00:38:03,480
[SPEAKER_01]: We made the decision as a school district to continue that contact tracing because we had essentially built up a robust testing program that we knew families and students and staff were relying on.

428
00:38:04,461 --> 00:38:06,823
[SPEAKER_01]: We think that that was the right, we and Ms.

429
00:38:06,843 --> 00:38:11,328
[SPEAKER_01]: Saenz can chime in, but as an administration we feel that was the right decision at the time.

430
00:38:12,328 --> 00:38:23,373
[SPEAKER_01]: As you know, there were a number of occasions in which there were options to essentially take an off ramp from our testing program to transition to the test and stay program that at the time was was being endorsed by the state.

431
00:38:24,053 --> 00:38:33,597
[SPEAKER_01]: And we felt at the time, based on the factors on the ground, that our testing program essentially provided a greater level of insulation than the

432
00:38:34,998 --> 00:38:36,199
[SPEAKER_01]: than the test and stay program.

433
00:38:37,220 --> 00:39:01,177
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of those variables have changed and it's being manifested in situations like today, when there were classes of a dozen or more students who were escorted down to the testing area and based on either previous positivity and maybe some cases in consent forms, but only a very small fraction of those classes were actually going through and having their tests administered.

434
00:39:02,337 --> 00:39:24,427
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not surprising based on the numbers that we've seen in recent weeks, but it also begins to tilt the scale with regard to exactly what benefits we are affording our students and families when we're running this program that is essentially occupying a significant amount of our time operationally for increasingly limited benefits.

435
00:39:25,027 --> 00:39:31,349
[SPEAKER_01]: and that equation begins to evolve even more so when there are rapid tests that we're able to send home.

436
00:39:32,189 --> 00:39:47,353
[SPEAKER_01]: So under this plan what we would do is again we would continue their surveillance testing and it's sort of a belt and suspenders approach that we would have an overlap with our surveillance testing and our rapid tests for the first several weeks but we would step down the contact tracing and then ultimately we would make the shift

437
00:39:48,033 --> 00:39:53,314
[SPEAKER_01]: at the end of February to the diagnostic testing and testing of symptomatic.

438
00:39:53,354 --> 00:40:02,456
[SPEAKER_01]: We intend to maintain our partnership with Tufts and the Broad Institute so that we're not reliant only on the rapid antigen test that DESE is providing.

439
00:40:02,916 --> 00:40:14,658
[SPEAKER_01]: So, again, we're still going to be doing a both-and approach, but this will allow us to refocus our efforts, particularly in the health services department, on some of the core functions that

440
00:40:15,218 --> 00:40:20,462
[SPEAKER_01]: are, to some extent, despite the best efforts and really herculean efforts of our school nurses.

441
00:40:20,842 --> 00:40:31,390
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are pieces of the work that are being neglected right now because of the approach that we've gone with, which I think it's fair to say it was a strategic decision.

442
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:33,712
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, not one that I think any of us regret.

443
00:40:34,753 --> 00:40:40,117
[SPEAKER_01]: But we've sort of passed the point at which what we're doing is considered a best practice.

444
00:40:42,058 --> 00:40:55,787
[SPEAKER_01]: This would be pool testing for the next three weeks with contact tracing, pool testing for the next six weeks, excuse me, surveillance testing, and then the adoption of the rapid test distribution in the first week of February.

445
00:40:55,887 --> 00:41:00,110
[SPEAKER_01]: And eventually that will be the centerpiece of our testing strategy going forward in March.

446
00:41:01,451 --> 00:41:01,531
[SPEAKER_01]: Ms.

447
00:41:01,571 --> 00:41:06,574
[SPEAKER_01]: Hines, is there anything you wanna add or did I get it right?

448
00:41:07,815 --> 00:41:09,016
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you got it right.

449
00:41:09,116 --> 00:41:10,557
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

450
00:41:12,373 --> 00:41:12,595
[SPEAKER_12]: Mayor.

451
00:41:14,209 --> 00:41:14,693
[SPEAKER_12]: Member Ruseau.

452
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:15,980
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

453
00:41:16,321 --> 00:41:24,947
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, I, I really appreciate having the plan for future weeks, which is, seems like a huge turning point that we can plan more than the next day.

454
00:41:25,967 --> 00:41:30,370
[SPEAKER_01]: You say that Mr. So, but you do remind me, it is conditioned upon the positivity rates declining.

455
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:31,291
[SPEAKER_01]: I should, I should have that.

456
00:41:31,331 --> 00:41:34,593
[SPEAKER_01]: So our expectation is declining positivity rates at this point.

457
00:41:35,054 --> 00:41:39,597
[SPEAKER_01]: And assuming we see that, um, this would be what we would, how we would execute that.

458
00:41:39,637 --> 00:41:40,417
[SPEAKER_01]: But I appreciate that.

459
00:41:40,437 --> 00:41:44,160
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if that was a potential reminder or not, but I, if it was, I appreciate it.

460
00:41:44,470 --> 00:41:44,790
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

461
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:48,551
[SPEAKER_12]: I also think there's another dependency, that's that the state can come through with tests.

462
00:41:48,851 --> 00:41:50,632
[SPEAKER_12]: I still can't buy one at the CVS, can you?

463
00:41:52,053 --> 00:41:54,153
[SPEAKER_12]: But somehow they're gonna distribute millions of them.

464
00:41:55,194 --> 00:41:55,994
[SPEAKER_12]: That's fascinating.

465
00:41:56,914 --> 00:42:05,557
[SPEAKER_12]: But my question was about, in the last, and on Friday's update from the superintendent, it said that you were doing PCRs this week, individual PCRs.

466
00:42:05,577 --> 00:42:06,277
[SPEAKER_12]: Was that just a?

467
00:42:06,417 --> 00:42:07,318
[SPEAKER_01]: It was an error.

468
00:42:07,578 --> 00:42:08,238
[SPEAKER_01]: An error, okay.

469
00:42:08,318 --> 00:42:10,199
[SPEAKER_12]: I just wanted to share, nothing changed.

470
00:42:10,219 --> 00:42:11,259
[SPEAKER_01]: It is full testing this week.

471
00:42:12,203 --> 00:42:16,085
[SPEAKER_01]: It is still PCR testing, and I think that's important that people should remember that.

472
00:42:16,685 --> 00:42:24,569
[SPEAKER_01]: When we talk about PCR testing, it's the best in class, highest level of reliability, regardless of, or generally, regardless of viral load.

473
00:42:24,589 --> 00:42:28,811
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not gonna attest to that myself, but more reliable, generally speaking, than the rapid test.

474
00:42:30,292 --> 00:42:32,393
[SPEAKER_01]: The pool test is just the way in which it's administered.

475
00:42:32,693 --> 00:42:41,337
[SPEAKER_01]: And just as an example, if I could, the problem with the pool testing, why ultimately, once the free rapid tests are available, we're keeping people fully out of the building,

476
00:42:41,897 --> 00:42:44,899
[SPEAKER_01]: if they have enough viral load to test positive in a rapid test.

477
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:58,087
[SPEAKER_01]: And the pool testing, which again, is our only option from a PCR perspective, there's a full 24 hour window in which, and really a 48 hour window, as compared to the rapid test in which people are coming into the building and potentially contagious.

478
00:42:58,648 --> 00:43:01,529
[SPEAKER_01]: At the beginning of this, those rapid tests weren't available to your point.

479
00:43:01,649 --> 00:43:10,355
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we don't have them at our fingertips just yet, but assuming that that commitment by DESI is something that they, I think it will be, is executed properly.

480
00:43:11,142 --> 00:43:12,584
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a more reliable way.

481
00:43:13,144 --> 00:43:16,247
[SPEAKER_01]: And also importantly, and I should have mentioned this in my comments,

482
00:43:18,097 --> 00:43:23,541
[SPEAKER_01]: students will need to opt into the program in order to receive the rapid tests.

483
00:43:24,341 --> 00:43:32,487
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a significant procedural step that I don't know that was necessarily a centerpiece of the media messaging with regard to DESE.

484
00:43:33,107 --> 00:43:41,333
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of our concerns is if we were to keep the surveillance testing open in perpetuity, in addition to the drain on resources, both human capital and financial,

485
00:43:42,173 --> 00:43:46,077
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we think it will be a disincentive for folks to opt into the rapid tests.

486
00:43:46,177 --> 00:43:48,760
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that is another reason that it needs to be phased out.

487
00:43:50,202 --> 00:43:50,582
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

488
00:43:52,864 --> 00:43:53,925
[SPEAKER_04]: Miss, um, member Hays.

489
00:43:54,866 --> 00:43:55,127
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

490
00:43:55,587 --> 00:43:57,169
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I have a question.

491
00:43:57,209 --> 00:43:59,411
[SPEAKER_04]: If you could go back, I don't know if you can go back to the chart.

492
00:43:59,911 --> 00:44:01,313
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't, but I bet Dr. Cushing can.

493
00:44:07,093 --> 00:44:07,713
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

494
00:44:08,073 --> 00:44:13,355
[SPEAKER_04]: So on the week of 2-7 where it says PCR pool testing and contact tracing for high need students.

495
00:44:13,475 --> 00:44:13,695
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

496
00:44:13,975 --> 00:44:16,576
[SPEAKER_04]: Is the PCR testing only for high need students?

497
00:44:16,816 --> 00:44:17,316
[SPEAKER_01]: Great question.

498
00:44:17,336 --> 00:44:18,997
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for pointing that out.

499
00:44:19,437 --> 00:44:30,200
[SPEAKER_01]: The contact tracing, while it will be stepped down and reduced generally, consistent with the practices that the City of Medford Board of Health and Boards of Health across the Commonwealth are following.

500
00:44:30,958 --> 00:44:37,022
[SPEAKER_01]: We have made a strategic decision that we will maintain contact tracing for some of our high-need, most vulnerable populations.

501
00:44:37,543 --> 00:44:43,767
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that could include kindergarten students, non-communicative students, ELL students in certain cases.

502
00:44:44,267 --> 00:44:53,013
[SPEAKER_01]: We will be, health services will be monitoring that to make sure that we continue having that layer of insulation in addition to the testing itself.

503
00:44:53,513 --> 00:44:55,295
[SPEAKER_01]: So the PCR testing will be for everyone?

504
00:44:55,355 --> 00:44:55,635
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.

505
00:44:56,135 --> 00:44:56,355
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

506
00:44:56,435 --> 00:44:58,897
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I have a couple other questions unless someone else

507
00:44:59,511 --> 00:45:00,252
[SPEAKER_06]: I have the same question.

508
00:45:00,292 --> 00:45:04,840
[SPEAKER_06]: So PCR pool testing for everybody, but the contact tracing for high needs.

509
00:45:05,461 --> 00:45:06,703
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a good question.

510
00:45:06,743 --> 00:45:07,485
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, continue.

511
00:45:09,564 --> 00:45:19,554
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to ask about the infographic that went out, which I thought it was great that it went out so quickly that that information just in a really clear simplified.

512
00:45:19,574 --> 00:45:21,757
[SPEAKER_04]: That was wonderful and helpful.

513
00:45:22,317 --> 00:45:29,485
[SPEAKER_04]: I did want to ask about one possible clarification on that, if there's possibility of tweaking it.

514
00:45:30,526 --> 00:45:40,452
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't think it was particularly clear when day one since the since really day zero is supposed to be the day when you first find you have symptoms or test positive.

515
00:45:40,973 --> 00:45:43,475
[SPEAKER_04]: And then from there you start counting one.

516
00:45:44,355 --> 00:45:46,337
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd ask Miss Hines just to comment on that.

517
00:45:46,597 --> 00:45:48,138
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, sure.

518
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:50,800
[SPEAKER_00]: I can comment on that.

519
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:52,361
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think

520
00:45:53,530 --> 00:45:58,457
[SPEAKER_00]: As a note, that's an infographic for general information.

521
00:45:59,078 --> 00:46:05,888
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, if someone tests positive or is identified as a close contact, they're going to be having a conversation with the school nurse.

522
00:46:06,208 --> 00:46:10,054
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where we identify day zero, because a lot of different things go into play.

523
00:46:10,414 --> 00:46:13,176
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they have symptoms they didn't recognize as true COVID symptoms?

524
00:46:13,256 --> 00:46:19,899
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we're finding a lot of families or students don't think just a headache or just a sore throat can be their day zero of symptoms.

525
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:29,285
[SPEAKER_00]: And also with pool testing, what day they tested in the pool versus what day they got their confirmatory rapid or PCR also confuses some of our students and families.

526
00:46:29,825 --> 00:46:35,448
[SPEAKER_00]: So as much as day zero is where we start our count, that could be really different for everyone.

527
00:46:36,008 --> 00:46:39,631
[SPEAKER_00]: And we didn't want to make the infographic too wordy or too confusing.

528
00:46:40,751 --> 00:46:52,619
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, in any of these circumstances, they're going to be having a conversation with their school nurse, who's going to send them a very detailed timeline saying day zero, day one, day five, day six, on and on and on.

529
00:46:53,279 --> 00:46:54,600
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope that helps clear it up.

530
00:46:56,413 --> 00:47:02,938
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a daily balance that Miss Hines and her team are striking with regard from a communications perspective.

531
00:47:03,299 --> 00:47:11,125
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to provide enough information that everyone in the community has a bedrock amount of knowledge that they need to make decisions for them and their families.

532
00:47:11,525 --> 00:47:22,594
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the same time, when communicating en masse, there is a risk, as Miss Hines points out, that too much information, we're going to lose part of our constituency that we're trying to target the messaging to.

533
00:47:22,675 --> 00:47:22,915
[SPEAKER_01]: And so,

534
00:47:23,995 --> 00:47:28,757
[SPEAKER_01]: When in doubt, the best course of action is to always pose the question to the school nurse.

535
00:47:30,018 --> 00:47:36,100
[SPEAKER_04]: With that in mind, I wanted to ask again about the communication going home in the backpack that we've talked about a few times.

536
00:47:36,548 --> 00:47:55,969
[SPEAKER_04]: if we can get again because there's so many changes that are happening that to get that home because not everyone always accesses the information that comes either through email or on the school website and we talked about that and I was hoping that maybe that's going to happen soon especially because then we can get make sure it all gets out translated and

537
00:47:56,730 --> 00:47:57,531
[SPEAKER_04]: everyone gets it.

538
00:47:58,151 --> 00:47:59,432
[SPEAKER_01]: It is going to happen soon.

539
00:47:59,712 --> 00:48:08,498
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we've intentionally not done it yet because, um, we knew there was a likelihood of some of these variables changing between your last meeting and tonight.

540
00:48:08,819 --> 00:48:13,942
[SPEAKER_01]: So had we sent a message on the backpack a week ago, we would have needed to send another one the following week.

541
00:48:13,962 --> 00:48:16,404
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that potentially could have even been more confusing.

542
00:48:16,804 --> 00:48:23,629
[SPEAKER_01]: But now that the facts are sort of starting to settle, um, I would expect that we would do that within the next week or so in the next week.

543
00:48:24,282 --> 00:48:33,609
[SPEAKER_01]: I think in the next week or so, I want to make sure that it's timed in proximity to some of the actual changes so that we are maximizing the value of that communication.

544
00:48:33,649 --> 00:48:36,350
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would anticipate it happening within the next week or so.

545
00:48:37,751 --> 00:48:38,092
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

546
00:48:38,192 --> 00:48:38,532
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

547
00:48:42,375 --> 00:48:48,099
[SPEAKER_06]: And then on that, Mr. Murphy, just in general, it probably should lead to a website because things are ever changing.

548
00:48:48,239 --> 00:48:52,202
[SPEAKER_06]: So even if you send out a communication next week, it will probably change the week after.

549
00:48:54,316 --> 00:48:54,576
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree.

550
00:48:54,656 --> 00:48:55,657
[SPEAKER_06]: The paper usage.

551
00:48:55,737 --> 00:48:55,937
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

552
00:48:56,898 --> 00:48:58,719
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, member Graham, Graham.

553
00:48:59,219 --> 00:49:00,240
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, wait, what was it?

554
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:00,740
[SPEAKER_06]: What'd you say?

555
00:49:02,641 --> 00:49:02,861
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

556
00:49:02,881 --> 00:49:04,022
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Graham, then member Kreatz.

557
00:49:05,503 --> 00:49:06,424
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, thank you.

558
00:49:06,564 --> 00:49:15,309
[SPEAKER_15]: So in mid February, when we shift our contact tracing efforts, I just want to make sure what I think you mean is really what you mean.

559
00:49:15,329 --> 00:49:15,369
[SPEAKER_15]: So

560
00:49:17,395 --> 00:49:31,680
[SPEAKER_15]: Parents should really at after that point not expect to get a call saying their child was a close contact of somebody who tested positive in full testing and therefore has to stay home because they are unvaccinated or.

561
00:49:33,254 --> 00:49:37,736
[SPEAKER_15]: they get a call saying your child was a close contact and they're vaccinated to watch for symptoms.

562
00:49:37,776 --> 00:49:44,240
[SPEAKER_15]: So what we're saying is that communication that's happening right now will stop for the most part.

563
00:49:44,880 --> 00:50:01,229
[SPEAKER_15]: And instead, students vaccinated and unvaccinated will have access to at-home tests so that if they see symptoms, they can test right there on the spot and know whether their child is positive or not.

564
00:50:01,269 --> 00:50:02,070
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that correct?

565
00:50:02,558 --> 00:50:03,999
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that is correct.

566
00:50:04,239 --> 00:50:13,785
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only sort of, um, uh, points I would make in that, that second group of students that you referenced in your example, so you are, you are correct.

567
00:50:14,146 --> 00:50:27,274
[SPEAKER_01]: The communication, uh, to the close contacts of those who have tested positive will not come from the school after the week of February 7th.

568
00:50:27,695 --> 00:50:27,935
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

569
00:50:29,205 --> 00:50:35,286
[SPEAKER_01]: However, with the exception of the high need populations that we referenced earlier, that will continue.

570
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:49,850
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other exception, not exception, but the second group that you just mentioned where we currently contact vaccinated close contacts, not to tell them to quarantine because that wouldn't be consistent with the protocol.

571
00:50:50,290 --> 00:50:56,471
[SPEAKER_01]: We communicate to vaccinated close contacts and tell them to monitor for symptoms.

572
00:50:57,732 --> 00:51:16,847
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a good practice when there is capacity to do that, but to go back to the point about the need to sort of strategize around how we deploy our human capital and not lose sight of core functionality, particularly in the health services department, who have a host of core responsibilities that they really need to attend to.

573
00:51:18,870 --> 00:51:21,995
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sort of a good example of why we have to rethink this.

574
00:51:22,596 --> 00:51:25,840
[SPEAKER_01]: Every single one of us has a responsibility to monitor for symptoms.

575
00:51:26,501 --> 00:51:34,192
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you are getting a phone call saying your child is a close contact, but because they're vaccinated, all they have to do is monitor for symptoms.

576
00:51:35,081 --> 00:51:46,686
[SPEAKER_01]: Why I think we can appreciate, particularly as we've gone through the various phases of this pandemic, the value and the sense of confidence that people feel because they're being told that just be you have to be extra careful.

577
00:51:47,166 --> 00:51:51,068
[SPEAKER_01]: All we're really doing at that point is tracking people down to tell them something that we tell them to do.

578
00:51:51,628 --> 00:51:53,229
[SPEAKER_01]: every single time we communicate with them.

579
00:51:53,650 --> 00:52:05,138
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think from our perspective, when we are thinking about the best use of resources, we have to sort of weigh that against all the things that are not being done while we're making the phone call to tell everyone to do the thing that we've already told you to do.

580
00:52:06,353 --> 00:52:07,334
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope that was helpful.

581
00:52:07,394 --> 00:52:08,374
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

582
00:52:08,874 --> 00:52:18,279
[SPEAKER_15]: And then I think the other question that I had, and maybe this is a question for, can you provide this to us in some fashion in the future?

583
00:52:18,299 --> 00:52:32,026
[SPEAKER_15]: So my understanding is, in general and here in Medford, people that we have excluded from school because they are close contacts really fairly rarely have ultimately tested positive.

584
00:52:34,234 --> 00:52:34,894
[SPEAKER_15]: for COVID.

585
00:52:34,914 --> 00:52:38,155
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's one piece of data.

586
00:52:38,195 --> 00:52:48,317
[SPEAKER_15]: I would just like somebody to be able to validate or say yes, that I don't even need like precise numbers, but that yes, that's generally what we're finding and it's holding through this surge.

587
00:52:49,417 --> 00:52:54,478
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that would be really helpful for people to know.

588
00:52:54,778 --> 00:53:01,380
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not to say that, I want to make clear that to the person who catches COVID in the school, the fact that,

589
00:53:01,987 --> 00:53:04,408
[SPEAKER_01]: they are a very, very rare example of somebody.

590
00:53:04,428 --> 00:53:05,268
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, it doesn't matter.

591
00:53:05,468 --> 00:53:06,349
[SPEAKER_01]: They really don't care.

592
00:53:06,429 --> 00:53:29,277
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wanna be, I sort of have a degree of empathy for the family who's got a student at home right now listening to this saying, that's nice that you're saying it's somewhere potentially between one and 2%, and that's at a national level, which means for an organization like us who has put all of these precautions into place, the number you could infer would be even lower, but it doesn't matter when it does happen.

593
00:53:29,675 --> 00:53:42,210
[SPEAKER_01]: sure but your point I think is accurate that in-school transmission is exceedingly rare and that is part of what we're weighing here because while the chance

594
00:53:42,805 --> 00:53:50,686
[SPEAKER_01]: for contraction may be rare, the chance for regression when students are excluded from school is very significant.

595
00:53:50,786 --> 00:53:55,747
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something that is a reality that we are frankly living on a daily basis, as I know many families are.

596
00:53:56,227 --> 00:53:56,407
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

597
00:53:56,487 --> 00:54:06,349
[SPEAKER_15]: And I, the reason that I say that is because I think, you know, families are sort of in this constant assessment of risk mode.

598
00:54:07,289 --> 00:54:10,770
[SPEAKER_15]: And every time there's a change in the program that sort of brings

599
00:54:11,647 --> 00:54:21,751
[SPEAKER_15]: the sort of need to like reassess how I'm assessing risk personally to the surface again, to say, you know, am I comfortable?

600
00:54:21,791 --> 00:54:22,731
[SPEAKER_15]: Am I uncomfortable?

601
00:54:23,292 --> 00:54:29,394
[SPEAKER_15]: Does this create unnecessary, you know, does this create an intolerable amount of risk for my family because I have somebody who's very ill at home or whatever?

602
00:54:30,514 --> 00:54:38,998
[SPEAKER_15]: So just, you know, any data points or messages of clarification that you could share about that would, I think would be helpful to some.

603
00:54:39,058 --> 00:54:39,878
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think to others,

604
00:54:41,131 --> 00:54:44,534
[SPEAKER_15]: as you mentioned, if they have been that person, it's not going to matter that much to them.

605
00:54:44,554 --> 00:54:55,082
[SPEAKER_15]: But I think for those folks who are really, um, concerned as this, as this shifting happens, I do want to try to address their concerns.

606
00:54:55,142 --> 00:55:07,271
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think the other piece of data that I, um, is like gets harder and harder to parse every single day is this like overwhelming feeling that, you know, all of these people who are vaccinated, who have COVID and,

607
00:55:08,705 --> 00:55:20,933
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think that's at, like, I think in the aggregate, the numbers are still quite substantially like indicating that vaccines are, they work and they're effective and all of those things.

608
00:55:22,574 --> 00:55:29,538
[SPEAKER_15]: So I would be interested to know what data, if any, we have on breakthrough infections in our student population.

609
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:35,562
[SPEAKER_15]: And I don't know, like, again, I don't need you to answer it today, but just,

610
00:55:37,772 --> 00:55:43,114
[SPEAKER_15]: something about those two questions, I think, would be very helpful for people to understand.

611
00:55:43,134 --> 00:55:45,515
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that's fair.

612
00:55:45,555 --> 00:55:59,680
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we can certainly incorporate that into some of our communications, particularly as we articulate the underlying rationale to some of these shifts, again, to the point of those who have contracted or potentially could contract

613
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:10,128
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the data will have, you know, a different sort of weight, I suspect, but, um, and I think with regard to breakthrough infections, and I think, um, that is data that is available to us.

614
00:56:10,168 --> 00:56:12,109
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think this will be able to, something we'll be able to provide.

615
00:56:12,590 --> 00:56:27,521
[SPEAKER_01]: I do think as is the case when this is looked at, whether it's at the state level, nationally or here in Medford, um, the numbers around severity that is a, it is a relevant, um, fact in conjunction with the breakthrough infections, because, um,

616
00:56:28,692 --> 00:56:34,914
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, part of the sort of the reality of the vaccines is that it does not, obviously it does not assure you that you will not get COVID.

617
00:56:35,374 --> 00:56:41,416
[SPEAKER_01]: It does provide a, um, substantial layer of protection against severe illness.

618
00:56:41,476 --> 00:56:45,938
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, um, that just has to be part of the conversation when we talk about breakthrough infections.

619
00:56:46,678 --> 00:57:03,084
[SPEAKER_15]: And then I also wondered if you could, or if you had any information about the media reports that we're seeing about the legislature taking votes to send improved quality masks for students or DESE.

620
00:57:03,564 --> 00:57:05,225
[SPEAKER_15]: There's been various

621
00:57:08,038 --> 00:57:13,802
[SPEAKER_15]: publications, you know, down the, down the chain of politics around what is coming.

622
00:57:14,102 --> 00:57:21,708
[SPEAKER_15]: And I just am curious, like, are there masks coming for kids or do we not know?

623
00:57:21,808 --> 00:57:22,809
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think we know.

624
00:57:23,049 --> 00:57:25,531
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm familiar with some of the reports that you're talking about.

625
00:57:25,911 --> 00:57:32,956
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think we know with certainty, although it does bring to mind that one of the other pieces I think is for families to be aware of is that

626
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:51,930
[SPEAKER_01]: while we're adjusting our testing program, we're not, frankly, people aren't gonna have less access to testing, one, and also many of the other protocols that we have in place in terms of reminding folks about distancing and the mask wearing for the time being, those are, for now, remaining intact.

627
00:57:52,051 --> 00:57:56,914
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that is another piece that will hopefully help people have some peace of mind.

628
00:57:58,776 --> 00:57:59,016
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

629
00:58:00,449 --> 00:58:00,769
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

630
00:58:01,350 --> 00:58:02,811
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

631
00:58:03,351 --> 00:58:03,551
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

632
00:58:03,792 --> 00:58:04,192
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

633
00:58:04,392 --> 00:58:05,173
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, yes.

634
00:58:05,273 --> 00:58:09,416
[SPEAKER_14]: So, um, I have a question and you might've mentioned it and I just might've missed it.

635
00:58:10,037 --> 00:58:13,699
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, you did say that students will need to opt in to get the rapid test.

636
00:58:13,719 --> 00:58:24,448
[SPEAKER_14]: So I wanted to know, um, are these, are they, is there going to be a distribution of the test kits and you know, they're going to be sent home every week or every two weeks, or is this,

637
00:58:25,201 --> 00:58:27,364
[SPEAKER_14]: they're still going to be doing the rapid tests in school.

638
00:58:27,944 --> 00:58:37,374
[SPEAKER_14]: I just, I wasn't sure what that meant because I've been hearing some communications on the news where if schools opt in, they're going to be sending home the kits to the families.

639
00:58:37,775 --> 00:58:39,477
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that what we're doing or we're not doing that?

640
00:58:39,617 --> 00:58:40,277
[SPEAKER_01]: Great question.

641
00:58:40,678 --> 00:58:40,798
[SPEAKER_01]: Ms.

642
00:58:40,838 --> 00:58:42,460
[SPEAKER_01]: Hines will be attending a meeting

643
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:47,204
[SPEAKER_01]: with DESE representatives on Wednesday, in which I think some of these points will be clarified.

644
00:58:47,644 --> 00:58:56,592
[SPEAKER_01]: Based on the communications we've seen so far, what we anticipate is within the next week, we will receive our supply of rapid tests that are meant for staff.

645
00:58:57,552 --> 00:59:02,837
[SPEAKER_01]: And then within the next two weeks, we will receive a supply of tests for students.

646
00:59:03,317 --> 00:59:05,379
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the question that I have

647
00:59:06,329 --> 00:59:07,050
[SPEAKER_01]: and I hope that Ms.

648
00:59:07,070 --> 00:59:15,338
[SPEAKER_01]: Hines returns for her webinar on Wednesday with an answer, is we have, obviously when we sign up and we apply, we tell them how many staff, we tell them how many students.

649
00:59:16,078 --> 00:59:20,703
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they have that information already, I hope, but either way, we fill it out and we tell them.

650
00:59:21,323 --> 00:59:23,685
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's unclear, I think, at this point, and then Ms.

651
00:59:23,705 --> 00:59:25,607
[SPEAKER_01]: Hines, feel free to clarify if you know the answer to this.

652
00:59:27,041 --> 00:59:38,609
[SPEAKER_01]: It's unclear if the first shipment, if you will, is going to be based on the number of students we said we were ordering for or the number of students that we can attest to having submitted.

653
00:59:38,750 --> 00:59:51,879
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the communications would suggest it's going to be the latter, which is part of why we need to get this messaging out in all forms and why we are being as specific as we are with regard to the timeline on the surveillance testing.

654
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:55,522
[SPEAKER_01]: Because as you recall, both last year and this year,

655
00:59:56,126 --> 01:00:00,811
[SPEAKER_01]: our consent form percentage went up more slowly than we would have preferred.

656
01:00:00,831 --> 01:00:04,975
[SPEAKER_01]: And we want to try to get that, those percentages up as quickly as possible.

657
01:00:05,836 --> 01:00:09,680
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're giving ourselves a little bit of a runway by leaving the surveillance testing open.

658
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:18,569
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think if we were to suggest that that's open in perpetuity, it would just be one more disincentive to actually opting into this program that we're hoping people opt into.

659
01:00:19,441 --> 01:00:22,002
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's, I don't know the answer.

660
01:00:22,022 --> 01:00:25,784
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hoping we find out Wednesday, and I'm hoping they just give us as many tests as they can.

661
01:00:27,084 --> 01:00:30,205
[SPEAKER_14]: And is there a new consent form in the works right now?

662
01:00:30,726 --> 01:00:32,806
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a DESE, it's a new DESE form, so yeah.

663
01:00:33,307 --> 01:00:36,848
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're gonna, other districts have done it on an electronic platform and we hope to do the same.

664
01:00:38,849 --> 01:00:39,369
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, thank you.

665
01:00:39,609 --> 01:00:39,929
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

666
01:00:40,650 --> 01:00:41,810
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

667
01:00:41,830 --> 01:00:42,210
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

668
01:00:42,230 --> 01:00:46,372
[SPEAKER_06]: Number four, we have mid-year update on execution of the strategic plan

669
01:00:47,305 --> 01:00:52,215
[SPEAKER_06]: Superintendent Dr. Marice Edouard-Vincent will provide a mid-year update on the status of key initiatives.

670
01:00:52,455 --> 01:00:53,257
[SPEAKER_06]: Dr. Edouard-Vincent.

671
01:00:54,568 --> 01:00:55,449
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, thank you.

672
01:00:55,489 --> 01:01:04,917
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm very happy to be able to present this mid-year update on our newly approved strategic plan that is less than one years old.

673
01:01:05,557 --> 01:01:09,200
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm very excited about that opportunity.

674
01:01:10,181 --> 01:01:21,411
[SPEAKER_13]: So I wanna start off by just saying that our strategic plan, the Medford Public Schools strategic plan is essentially an encapsulation of our entire academic program.

675
01:01:22,827 --> 01:01:28,111
[SPEAKER_13]: It houses all of our key initiatives and programs that we are doing here within the district.

676
01:01:29,653 --> 01:01:35,338
[SPEAKER_13]: This particular media update will highlight specific programming that is reflective of our core values.

677
01:01:36,338 --> 01:01:42,784
[SPEAKER_13]: Achievement for all, collaboration for all, equity for all, and support and safety for all.

678
01:01:45,295 --> 01:01:58,213
[SPEAKER_13]: The examples that are given are not inclusive of every single initiative that is taking place, but each item is reflective of my highest priority, the goal of advancing the Medford Public Schools.

679
01:01:59,392 --> 01:02:11,422
[SPEAKER_13]: Medford Public Schools is an institution that will educate all students, irregardless of special learning needs, English language needs, identity needs, gender needs, or racial needs.

680
01:02:12,583 --> 01:02:16,727
[SPEAKER_13]: As a public school district, our primary task is to educate the whole child.

681
01:02:17,507 --> 01:02:25,895
[SPEAKER_13]: In Medford, we endeavor to see our students not just pass, but excel both academically and social emotionally.

682
01:02:27,367 --> 01:02:42,474
[SPEAKER_13]: From the beginning of the pandemic, we have prioritized our most vulnerable, knowing that if we get the systems in place to meet their needs, then we can expand upon those initiatives to enable the entire district to thrive.

683
01:02:43,715 --> 01:02:49,897
[SPEAKER_13]: Through thoughtful collaboration and true partnership with families, we have seen a positive difference.

684
01:02:50,978 --> 01:02:55,060
[SPEAKER_13]: We took a strong stance and our positionality has served us well.

685
01:02:56,756 --> 01:03:01,397
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm prioritizing the physical and emotional health and safety of our entire community.

686
01:03:02,557 --> 01:03:09,978
[SPEAKER_13]: We are fully committed to designing creative learning environments for our students in order to prepare them for a better tomorrow.

687
01:03:11,199 --> 01:03:23,681
[SPEAKER_13]: This strategic plan, which was created after two years of thoughtful collaboration amongst different stakeholders, it is the master blueprint that guides all the work that I do within the district.

688
01:03:25,086 --> 01:03:37,956
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, my core values and foreguarding pillars are achievement for all, collaboration for all, equity for all, and support and safety for all, ACES.

689
01:03:39,097 --> 01:03:46,403
[SPEAKER_13]: In order for Medford Public Schools to continue to stand apart from others, we will continue to try our best for all.

690
01:03:47,732 --> 01:03:55,657
[SPEAKER_13]: As I highlight only some of the key initiatives, please know that this is a multi-year living document that will continue to evolve.

691
01:03:56,997 --> 01:04:03,381
[SPEAKER_13]: This document will shift and adjust as needed in order for us to continue to meet the needs of all of our learners.

692
01:04:04,482 --> 01:04:08,424
[SPEAKER_13]: These are my priorities, and this is what you can expect to see and hear from me.

693
01:04:09,970 --> 01:04:20,173
[SPEAKER_13]: I also want to say that due to the pandemic, the district has been challenged by ongoing staffing shortages during this 21-22 school year.

694
01:04:21,153 --> 01:04:37,157
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to commend our staff for their incredible flexibility and willingness to embrace new testing initiatives, curricula and data collection, as well as coverage during this difficult time.

695
01:04:37,938 --> 01:04:39,458
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you to all of my staff.

696
01:04:42,016 --> 01:04:58,150
[SPEAKER_13]: So under the bucket of A, achievement, student growth and achievement, the key initiatives that we've worked on thus far, just this school year, the newly adopted NWEA MAP assessment.

697
01:04:59,431 --> 01:05:03,415
[SPEAKER_13]: This data assessment platform can be used for all K-12 students.

698
01:05:04,958 --> 01:05:17,041
[SPEAKER_13]: All of our teachers have been trained and they are implementing and reviewing data that's four to five months old, getting ready to do their second assessment shortly in the coming weeks.

699
01:05:18,522 --> 01:05:26,824
[SPEAKER_13]: This NWEA MAP assessment really will help us revolutionize the way we monitor instruction internally.

700
01:05:28,574 --> 01:05:36,139
[SPEAKER_13]: Another key initiative under achievement is our elementary math adoption, which is ongoing right now.

701
01:05:36,159 --> 01:05:48,808
[SPEAKER_13]: The elementary math programming will be selecting a new curriculum to present, a new program, I should say, to present to the school committee by the late spring.

702
01:05:50,970 --> 01:05:54,452
[SPEAKER_13]: Currently, right now, all classrooms are using InVisions 2020.

703
01:05:56,313 --> 01:06:00,803
[SPEAKER_13]: But of all of our elementary classrooms, 22 classrooms are piloting.

704
01:06:01,757 --> 01:06:09,183
[SPEAKER_13]: either Investigations 3, also known as Turk Investigations, and the other program is called Bridges.

705
01:06:10,223 --> 01:06:18,549
[SPEAKER_13]: So 22 classrooms, different grade levels, are piloting the two programs, and everyone else is using Envisions 2020.

706
01:06:19,910 --> 01:06:29,898
[SPEAKER_13]: And come late spring, a recommendation will be brought forward to the committee for a recommendation for a new program for next year.

707
01:06:31,973 --> 01:06:38,697
[SPEAKER_13]: So that is a strong academic achievement piece, and we're really excited about that.

708
01:06:39,937 --> 01:06:45,060
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, I wanna just highlight ECRI, which is our Enhanced Core Reading Instruction.

709
01:06:46,041 --> 01:06:56,767
[SPEAKER_13]: With ECRI, there has been a significant amount of work and training for our teachers, K-2, in order to meet the needs of our students.

710
01:06:57,947 --> 01:07:00,389
[SPEAKER_13]: With ECRI, we have trained everyone.

711
01:07:00,469 --> 01:07:17,762
[SPEAKER_13]: Training started back in March of 2020, and we've been working closely with Eleni Steadman, who is a wonderful facilitator and educator from Hill for Literacy, who has been providing training and ongoing coaching for staff.

712
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:33,148
[SPEAKER_13]: And just to refresh your memories, ECRI, again, is a tier one strategy that's aligned to the scope and sequence of journeys.

713
01:07:34,489 --> 01:07:41,915
[SPEAKER_13]: We are identifying or working with print concepts and phonological awareness, word recognition, fluency.

714
01:07:43,037 --> 01:07:51,980
[SPEAKER_13]: phonics, and some ECRI tier two programming is being used during our intervention instruction.

715
01:07:52,520 --> 01:08:01,523
[SPEAKER_13]: So that is a critically important shift that has taken place under the umbrella of achievement in our lower grades.

716
01:08:03,473 --> 01:08:08,678
[SPEAKER_13]: Underachievement as well is we've been training all administrators.

717
01:08:08,818 --> 01:08:21,570
[SPEAKER_13]: We've been participating in intensive professional development through this on supervision and evaluation, and that training will continue into next school year as well.

718
01:08:22,631 --> 01:08:29,655
[SPEAKER_13]: and also we've been having data professional development for all of our administrators this year.

719
01:08:30,816 --> 01:08:34,539
[SPEAKER_13]: That is one of the specific projects that Ms.

720
01:08:34,559 --> 01:08:41,263
[SPEAKER_13]: Williams is working with administrators on to further equip our administrators to be able to utilize

721
01:08:41,923 --> 01:08:44,944
[SPEAKER_13]: our new NWEO map platform.

722
01:08:45,544 --> 01:08:53,007
[SPEAKER_13]: So those are some of the key initiatives that are actually some pretty big bodies of work that are taking place right now.

723
01:08:53,947 --> 01:09:02,550
[SPEAKER_13]: Under the C for collaboration, the key areas when we're talking about collaboration and partnership, the importance of working with the team,

724
01:09:03,330 --> 01:09:12,429
[SPEAKER_13]: We brought on engagement specialists this year, new to the district, working with schools, working with families, supporting, working with students.

725
01:09:13,777 --> 01:09:20,603
[SPEAKER_13]: and providing support, a helping hand inside the schools, also touching upon some of our cell needs.

726
01:09:21,123 --> 01:09:26,108
[SPEAKER_13]: We continue to have a robust partnership with Tufts University, our Board of Health.

727
01:09:26,748 --> 01:09:30,591
[SPEAKER_13]: They are crucial COVID partners that have helped us to navigate.

728
01:09:31,352 --> 01:09:39,079
[SPEAKER_13]: We also have a collaboration with Elliott Family Services, where they provide counseling and supports for students and families.

729
01:09:40,405 --> 01:09:51,912
[SPEAKER_13]: And another collaborative venture that started last year online that we continued is the district-wide elementary common planning time.

730
01:09:52,492 --> 01:10:00,657
[SPEAKER_13]: This fosters the highest level of teacher collaboration and it promotes greater coherence across all schools.

731
01:10:01,998 --> 01:10:14,790
[SPEAKER_13]: a grade level team, all first grade teachers meeting together, talking together, having robust discussions together, pushing and probing one another to really bring out their best practices.

732
01:10:15,010 --> 01:10:22,337
[SPEAKER_13]: And so that is a very, very strong thing that is still going and it's a great example of collaboration.

733
01:10:23,738 --> 01:10:25,699
[SPEAKER_13]: under equity.

734
01:10:25,899 --> 01:10:28,000
[SPEAKER_13]: You just heard a presentation earlier.

735
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:34,242
[SPEAKER_13]: We have the equity process that will be working with us for this first phase of the equity audit.

736
01:10:34,962 --> 01:10:39,824
[SPEAKER_13]: We as a district also pursued a state competitive grant through DESE.

737
01:10:40,284 --> 01:10:45,506
[SPEAKER_13]: We were awarded the teacher diversification pilot program grant.

738
01:10:45,987 --> 01:10:47,747
[SPEAKER_13]: We received $22,346 that needs to be spent

739
01:10:52,229 --> 01:10:54,571
[SPEAKER_13]: by August.

740
01:10:54,591 --> 01:10:59,874
[SPEAKER_13]: That money is going to be used to help the district increase diversification.

741
01:10:59,894 --> 01:11:01,836
[SPEAKER_13]: This is an initiative of DESE.

742
01:11:02,436 --> 01:11:13,384
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's something that DESE is aware of and feels is a critically important need for districts to promote teacher diversification.

743
01:11:13,404 --> 01:11:18,588
[SPEAKER_13]: And some of that money will be used to help with a new teacher pipeline

744
01:11:20,269 --> 01:11:36,599
[SPEAKER_13]: And in our vocational side of the house, where we have our early childhood strand, some of that funding will be used to support some of our students who are in the early childhood programming to take some courses in professional development.

745
01:11:37,660 --> 01:11:51,581
[SPEAKER_13]: at Bunker Hill, so there's a lot of creativity with that $22,000, so we're very appreciative that DESI created this competitive grant, and we are so grateful that we were awarded that.

746
01:11:52,982 --> 01:12:06,387
[SPEAKER_13]: The Race Equity Task Force, we are still continuing to meet and really talk about race and listening to all of the stakeholders who participate in the Race Equity Task Force.

747
01:12:07,127 --> 01:12:14,010
[SPEAKER_13]: In addition to that, we have ABAR at the Roberts Elementary School, which is their anti-bias, anti-racism group.

748
01:12:14,710 --> 01:12:24,775
[SPEAKER_13]: where teachers and staff at all different grade levels are participating in a book study in teacher-led professional development, and it's high quality.

749
01:12:25,275 --> 01:12:34,980
[SPEAKER_13]: It's an excellent job that they're doing, and it's something that we hope to see how we can replicate that model and see if it can take place in some of the other schools.

750
01:12:35,380 --> 01:12:38,862
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is their first year doing it, and we're closely monitoring that.

751
01:12:40,017 --> 01:12:57,536
[SPEAKER_13]: We also have the pilot disability awareness program where selected grades across the district are being exposed to the disability awareness curriculum with the goal of dismantling ableism.

752
01:12:58,377 --> 01:13:12,493
[SPEAKER_13]: And again, it's select grade levels, but it is the conversations that need to be taking place to really level that playing field when we think about what does equity look like, what does equity mean.

753
01:13:13,715 --> 01:13:18,160
[SPEAKER_13]: Last but certainly not least is the ask for support and safety.

754
01:13:19,461 --> 01:13:34,470
[SPEAKER_13]: One of our highest priorities or an initiative that we've done this year is vaccinating hundreds of students, and I'm hoping this Wednesday's vaccination clinic will get another couple of hundred students to participate.

755
01:13:36,251 --> 01:13:41,914
[SPEAKER_13]: We continue to have counseling available for staff and students.

756
01:13:42,515 --> 01:13:45,637
[SPEAKER_13]: We have partnerships with

757
01:13:46,853 --> 01:13:49,495
[SPEAKER_13]: As I mentioned earlier, the Elliott family services.

758
01:13:49,995 --> 01:14:01,983
[SPEAKER_13]: We also have a partnership with respond, which is a community partner, which provided professional development for staff and students on domestic violence as needed.

759
01:14:02,584 --> 01:14:05,506
[SPEAKER_13]: And we have a brand new partner in a community member.

760
01:14:06,597 --> 01:14:21,000
[SPEAKER_13]: by the name of Patricia Brady, who is working with us right now to send a clinician to work with some of our students that for whatever reason may not have access to outside counseling.

761
01:14:21,020 --> 01:14:31,003
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is a brand new partnership and she's in the process of working closely with the schools to see if she can provide an additional

762
01:14:33,284 --> 01:14:38,908
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor to work with Medford Public Schools, and we are very excited and grateful for that new partnership.

763
01:14:40,088 --> 01:14:43,731
[SPEAKER_13]: We also have a lot of involvement with the Sandy Hook promises.

764
01:14:44,572 --> 01:14:47,093
[SPEAKER_13]: There's the see something, say something.

765
01:14:48,194 --> 01:15:00,183
[SPEAKER_13]: We have the start with hello and come the spring next, I believe early March, we're going to be working with signs of suicide that will be taking place at the high school levels.

766
01:15:00,744 --> 01:15:11,132
[SPEAKER_13]: But again, this all falls under the cell umbrella, but our commitment and dedication to supportive and safe learning environment for all.

767
01:15:11,892 --> 01:15:24,877
[SPEAKER_13]: And Elliott Family Services, we listed again, because not only is it a collaborative partnership, but again, our commitment to thinking about the whole child and the whole adult, the whole family.

768
01:15:25,557 --> 01:15:32,860
[SPEAKER_13]: And so supporting Elliott Family Services is offering counseling sessions once a week for staff.

769
01:15:33,820 --> 01:15:40,866
[SPEAKER_13]: and they do work with students and some families that are officially on their roster.

770
01:15:41,466 --> 01:15:47,210
[SPEAKER_13]: So that is just a mid-year update on what is happening with the strategic plan.

771
01:15:47,651 --> 01:15:48,071
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

772
01:15:50,253 --> 01:15:50,413
[SPEAKER_05]: Mayor.

773
01:15:51,205 --> 01:15:52,968
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Dr. Edouard-Vincent.

774
01:15:53,268 --> 01:15:53,929
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Ruseau.

775
01:15:54,811 --> 01:15:55,211
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

776
01:15:55,412 --> 01:16:04,747
[SPEAKER_12]: I hate to just ask such a technical question because there was so much good stuff there, but do we have to approve that grant or is it being a DESE grant we are not required to approve?

777
01:16:06,610 --> 01:16:15,594
[SPEAKER_13]: And since it's a competitive state grant, I don't believe that we had to get approval from the school committee.

778
01:16:16,134 --> 01:16:16,995
[SPEAKER_13]: It was competitive.

779
01:16:17,555 --> 01:16:19,856
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I certainly don't mean to apply.

780
01:16:19,936 --> 01:16:23,778
[SPEAKER_12]: I just mean to like to receive the funds to receive the funds we do, but I.

781
01:16:24,863 --> 01:16:28,607
[SPEAKER_12]: I feel like, you know, like we don't approve like title, whatever funds.

782
01:16:29,327 --> 01:16:34,572
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm just wondering if being a state grant, if we don't have to approve those funds also, I don't know.

783
01:16:34,692 --> 01:16:39,116
[SPEAKER_12]: But if we do, I just, you know, somebody should throw it on the agenda sometime so we can do that.

784
01:16:39,277 --> 01:16:40,518
[SPEAKER_12]: But okay.

785
01:16:40,618 --> 01:16:41,038
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

786
01:16:42,860 --> 01:16:44,061
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Dr. Edouard-Vincent.

787
01:16:44,582 --> 01:16:44,802
[SPEAKER_06]: Number

788
01:16:45,461 --> 01:16:46,382
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, member Graham.

789
01:16:47,162 --> 01:16:49,984
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry, I just had a relatively quick question.

790
01:16:50,345 --> 01:17:02,774
[SPEAKER_15]: When we approved the strategic plan last spring, I think one of the things we talked about was that there was a lot of discussion about our mission and vision statement in the various listening sessions that we did.

791
01:17:02,794 --> 01:17:08,118
[SPEAKER_15]: And we did put it on the agenda for this year to actually revisit those statements.

792
01:17:08,138 --> 01:17:10,260
[SPEAKER_15]: So I was curious when we plan to do that.

793
01:17:11,783 --> 01:17:18,806
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, we can definitely, that was, I listed the mission and vision that we had, but that's definitely on my radar.

794
01:17:18,826 --> 01:17:31,711
[SPEAKER_13]: So we can definitely begin that process of starting the mission and vision conversations to update it so that we can remove this one and get an updated one.

795
01:17:31,771 --> 01:17:33,431
[SPEAKER_13]: So we can definitely start that soon.

796
01:17:33,451 --> 01:17:34,172
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

797
01:17:34,332 --> 01:17:34,672
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

798
01:17:37,293 --> 01:17:37,573
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

799
01:17:39,417 --> 01:17:46,041
[SPEAKER_06]: Number five, we have enrichment program overview camp Mustang to be offered February and April vacation.

800
01:17:46,081 --> 01:17:53,826
[SPEAKER_06]: In addition to enrichment afterschool programs, K through 12 report presented by assistant superintendent of elementary education, Ms.

801
01:17:53,866 --> 01:18:01,551
[SPEAKER_06]: Suzanne Belusi, assistant superintendent of secondary education, Dr. Peter Cushing, and director of pupil services, Ms.

802
01:18:01,571 --> 01:18:02,151
[SPEAKER_06]: Joan Bowen.

803
01:18:03,332 --> 01:18:03,532
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome.

804
01:18:04,126 --> 01:18:04,666
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening.

805
01:18:05,086 --> 01:18:06,987
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening, mayor and school committee members.

806
01:18:07,788 --> 01:18:17,532
[SPEAKER_02]: Tonight, we're very excited to present the Camp Mustang 2.0 programming that we'll be offering during February and April vacations.

807
01:18:18,472 --> 01:18:21,233
[SPEAKER_02]: So why are we offering Camp Mustang 2.0?

808
01:18:21,974 --> 01:18:31,518
[SPEAKER_02]: We think it's a good opportunity to keep our Metro Public Schools students anchored to social activities with their peers over the vacation periods.

809
01:18:32,813 --> 01:18:38,840
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to provide Medford public school students with opportunities to stay social, emotionally connected.

810
01:18:40,381 --> 01:18:42,564
[SPEAKER_02]: We're using a district wide approach.

811
01:18:43,485 --> 01:18:48,190
[SPEAKER_02]: So there'll be elementary sessions, which will be in the morning about three hours.

812
01:18:48,751 --> 01:18:53,116
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in the afternoon, we'll have sessions for our secondary students.

813
01:18:54,130 --> 01:18:58,891
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd like to provide a variety of options for students to choose from each day.

814
01:18:59,991 --> 01:19:05,373
[SPEAKER_02]: District-wide staff members will develop and implement these activities.

815
01:19:06,513 --> 01:19:11,694
[SPEAKER_02]: The offerings that they are developing will focus on mind and movement.

816
01:19:12,434 --> 01:19:20,696
[SPEAKER_02]: So they may be academically oriented or project-based, as well as movement and physical activities.

817
01:19:21,852 --> 01:19:28,534
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first path of mind is currently we met with teachers today to talk about what the opportunities would be.

818
01:19:29,374 --> 01:19:35,075
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's at least three activities that the Medford Vocational Technical High School will offer.

819
01:19:35,555 --> 01:19:42,737
[SPEAKER_02]: And these examples could be culinary arts, cosmetology, graphic arts, robotics, and engineering.

820
01:19:43,197 --> 01:19:46,478
[SPEAKER_02]: They're in the process of fine tuning what the offerings will be.

821
01:19:46,498 --> 01:19:51,019
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we will be distributing this information to the public.

822
01:19:52,599 --> 01:20:02,243
[SPEAKER_02]: The project-based academic enrichment activities will be provided for students to select from, and some of these possible examples are STEM and engineering.

823
01:20:03,244 --> 01:20:07,265
[SPEAKER_02]: Through our fine arts department, we're looking at leveled strings instruction.

824
01:20:08,066 --> 01:20:16,029
[SPEAKER_02]: We're also looking at a variety of art-based activities, and then there will be social-emotional learning and body awareness activities.

825
01:20:17,744 --> 01:20:18,525
[SPEAKER_02]: the movements.

826
01:20:19,886 --> 01:20:25,872
[SPEAKER_18]: And then other offerings will be in the realm of movement.

827
01:20:25,972 --> 01:20:37,102
[SPEAKER_18]: So some of those possible activities will have students engaged in like yoga, mindfulness, cooperative games, team sports and activities.

828
01:20:38,083 --> 01:20:39,044
[SPEAKER_18]: As Ms.

829
01:20:39,084 --> 01:20:42,267
[SPEAKER_18]: Bowen said, we have the teachers finalizing those offerings.

830
01:20:43,747 --> 01:20:45,968
[SPEAKER_18]: The dates on the next slide.

831
01:20:46,048 --> 01:20:52,969
[SPEAKER_18]: So right now we're looking at two days during the February vacation and two days during the April vacation.

832
01:20:53,409 --> 01:21:00,770
[SPEAKER_18]: We wanted to be mindful of everyone's, you know, vacation times, but also keep students connected to school.

833
01:21:01,250 --> 01:21:11,712
[SPEAKER_18]: So both of those offerings are on the Tuesday and the Wednesday of each vacation week, so that they have the Monday holiday to celebrate with families and hopefully re-engage with school a little bit.

834
01:21:13,043 --> 01:21:13,383
[SPEAKER_18]: As Ms.

835
01:21:13,403 --> 01:21:23,914
[SPEAKER_18]: Bowen said, we're going to have the elementary students coming in in the morning for three hours from 8.30 to 11.30 and then the secondary staff coming in from 12.30 to 2.30.

836
01:21:24,435 --> 01:21:32,583
[SPEAKER_18]: All of this will be housed at the high school so that it is a district-wide approach and students are engaging with district-wide peers for these offerings.

837
01:21:35,407 --> 01:21:37,069
[SPEAKER_18]: The registration information.

838
01:21:37,129 --> 01:21:38,691
[SPEAKER_18]: So after, as Ms.

839
01:21:38,751 --> 01:21:40,434
[SPEAKER_18]: Bowen said, we met with staff today.

840
01:21:40,454 --> 01:21:45,661
[SPEAKER_18]: We have to say we are so grateful and excited about this.

841
01:21:45,701 --> 01:21:51,729
[SPEAKER_18]: We have about 24 to 28 staff that have come up with some fabulous activities.

842
01:21:52,356 --> 01:22:09,938
[SPEAKER_18]: To offer students of Medford and we're just so excited to release this this week, but we're compiling the activities and then a flyer and a Google form for the actual registration link will be provided on Thursday.

843
01:22:10,919 --> 01:22:18,425
[SPEAKER_18]: so that it is separate that will go out to all families and then it will also be embedded in the superintendent's email on Friday.

844
01:22:18,866 --> 01:22:28,894
[SPEAKER_18]: We will have a hard copy flyer so that it alerts families to and to tell them how to get to the Google form and we will also send it out clearly via email.

845
01:22:29,474 --> 01:22:33,258
[SPEAKER_18]: It will be translated and accessible for all of our families to sign up with the students.

846
01:22:34,038 --> 01:22:41,000
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it goes without saying, but I'm just going to say it anyway, that this is an offering that we are doing for students free of cost.

847
01:22:42,101 --> 01:22:48,643
[SPEAKER_18]: So families will just be able to have their children sign up and attend.

848
01:22:49,443 --> 01:23:00,807
[SPEAKER_18]: And the only thing we would like is that we want the students to try and have just, if they're signing up for both days, we're going to encourage them to sign up for two different activities so that they have a varying experience.

849
01:23:00,847 --> 01:23:01,647
[SPEAKER_18]: Hopefully, maybe they'll pick

850
01:23:02,380 --> 01:23:07,885
[SPEAKER_18]: mind and a movement activity but we will note that in the registration information.

851
01:23:08,846 --> 01:23:20,996
[SPEAKER_18]: We're hoping but dependent upon enrollment there may be some activities that we previously thought we could run that we wouldn't be able to run and we'll just let the staff and the families know about that.

852
01:23:24,059 --> 01:23:24,739
[SPEAKER_11]: So in

853
01:23:25,648 --> 01:23:30,057
[SPEAKER_11]: disparity keeping students really anchored with the Medford Public Schools Mustang community.

854
01:23:31,100 --> 01:23:35,910
[SPEAKER_11]: We're also working on providing enrichment opportunities in an extended day format.

855
01:23:36,567 --> 01:23:41,130
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're currently working on these, the opportunities we've provided K-12 based on school district data.

856
01:23:41,150 --> 01:23:43,631
[SPEAKER_11]: And we'll provide an update on this in about two weeks.

857
01:23:43,731 --> 01:23:45,072
[SPEAKER_11]: Right now we're recruiting staff.

858
01:23:45,773 --> 01:23:52,016
[SPEAKER_11]: We've run programs like this previously, but we're really trying to expand the number of days available.

859
01:23:52,156 --> 01:23:56,719
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe last, when it was previously offered, they were done for six sessions.

860
01:23:56,919 --> 01:23:58,140
[SPEAKER_11]: We're looking to double that.

861
01:23:59,561 --> 01:24:02,883
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's just some initial thinking that we're still trying to work through.

862
01:24:03,908 --> 01:24:07,011
[SPEAKER_11]: with various opportunities that have presented themselves.

863
01:24:07,752 --> 01:24:12,176
[SPEAKER_11]: So we will provide an update on that at our next school committee meeting.

864
01:24:13,077 --> 01:24:13,457
[SPEAKER_11]: Wonderful.

865
01:24:14,158 --> 01:24:14,478
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

866
01:24:14,958 --> 01:24:15,659
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Ruseau.

867
01:24:16,039 --> 01:24:16,360
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

868
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:17,321
[SPEAKER_12]: This is very exciting.

869
01:24:17,341 --> 01:24:21,544
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, this was something I was going to ask about and then this is sitting on my desk right here.

870
01:24:21,584 --> 01:24:27,710
[SPEAKER_12]: So is this being covered through our ARPA funding and all that other stuff?

871
01:24:27,965 --> 01:24:28,625
[SPEAKER_18]: That's a great question.

872
01:24:28,645 --> 01:24:30,086
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm so glad you asked that.

873
01:24:30,507 --> 01:24:32,988
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's probably going to be two ways.

874
01:24:33,048 --> 01:24:34,429
[SPEAKER_18]: So we did receive a grant.

875
01:24:34,509 --> 01:24:41,394
[SPEAKER_18]: We got a reimbursement grant for our Camp Mustang offering last summer because it was an SEL offering of $42,000.

876
01:24:41,794 --> 01:24:47,718
[SPEAKER_18]: So part of that reimbursement will be clearly put towards this.

877
01:24:48,578 --> 01:24:55,102
[SPEAKER_18]: Depending on some of the offerings, especially coming out of vocational school, we may have to dip into some Easter funds as well.

878
01:24:55,823 --> 01:24:56,143
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

879
01:24:56,323 --> 01:24:57,804
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

880
01:24:58,484 --> 01:24:59,164
[SPEAKER_17]: Member McLaughlin.

881
01:24:59,725 --> 01:25:00,105
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

882
01:25:00,145 --> 01:25:00,705
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for this.

883
01:25:00,745 --> 01:25:02,806
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm glad to hear that it's coming for SEL funding.

884
01:25:03,566 --> 01:25:05,467
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm wondering with Ms.

885
01:25:05,507 --> 01:25:11,430
[SPEAKER_17]: Bowen here as well, how we're able to support students with significant disabilities in this program?

886
01:25:11,710 --> 01:25:12,570
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, absolutely.

887
01:25:12,650 --> 01:25:18,292
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's, that's our goal is to have all of our students involved in and participate in this program.

888
01:25:18,332 --> 01:25:26,256
[SPEAKER_02]: We also have several paraprofessionals throughout the district have offered to work those two days as well to provide support.

889
01:25:26,856 --> 01:25:28,938
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sorry, I didn't hear your last sentence, sorry, Ms.

890
01:25:28,978 --> 01:25:29,098
[SPEAKER_17]: Baum.

891
01:25:29,118 --> 01:25:29,838
[SPEAKER_17]: What did you say, several?

892
01:25:29,858 --> 01:25:37,424
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have paraprofessionals that also signed up, knowing that we will have students with disabilities who may need extra support.

893
01:25:37,885 --> 01:25:48,693
[SPEAKER_02]: We're also adding at the bottom of the application to make sure that if your child requires any accommodations or modifications to indicate those, so we can plan accordingly.

894
01:25:48,713 --> 01:25:49,153
[SPEAKER_17]: That's great.

895
01:25:49,633 --> 01:25:53,036
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we'd also have a nurse available too, based on medical needs.

896
01:25:53,096 --> 01:25:53,757
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect, thank you.

897
01:25:54,776 --> 01:25:56,137
[SPEAKER_06]: And then just one question from the chair.

898
01:25:56,197 --> 01:26:00,200
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it like a rush to sign up or will there be unlimited entries?

899
01:26:01,120 --> 01:26:04,402
[SPEAKER_11]: So there will not be unlimited entries.

900
01:26:04,863 --> 01:26:12,588
[SPEAKER_11]: That was actually part of the conversation today was the, you know, some of the, some of the offerings say, just for example,

901
01:26:13,142 --> 01:26:15,344
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the proposals that we have is from metal fab.

902
01:26:16,505 --> 01:26:18,807
[SPEAKER_11]: And so a lot of that may provide some great opportunities.

903
01:26:19,647 --> 01:26:22,650
[SPEAKER_11]: We might not be able to have 20 students with only one educator there.

904
01:26:23,250 --> 01:26:26,433
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're going to be looking at the teacher recommendations.

905
01:26:27,394 --> 01:26:37,762
[SPEAKER_11]: We want to get as many students in as possible, but we also have to be realistic with some of the offerings, but we do want to get as many kids in as possible.

906
01:26:38,263 --> 01:26:38,483
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

907
01:26:38,803 --> 01:26:39,864
[SPEAKER_06]: And signups will start Friday.

908
01:26:41,478 --> 01:26:41,858
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

909
01:26:42,158 --> 01:26:44,620
[SPEAKER_06]: Thursday, but then you'll be in your message as well.

910
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:58,926
[SPEAKER_11]: Our hope is Thursday, but we're developing this with a Google sheet and want people to pick a first option and second option, develop a QR code and try to get it out as quickly as possible and making sure that the form actually functions.

911
01:26:59,586 --> 01:26:59,786
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

912
01:27:00,346 --> 01:27:01,007
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you so much.

913
01:27:01,767 --> 01:27:02,567
[SPEAKER_17]: Member McLaughlin.

914
01:27:02,687 --> 01:27:02,988
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

915
01:27:03,068 --> 01:27:06,729
[SPEAKER_17]: And can we also ensure that that notification gets out to our out of district?

916
01:27:07,209 --> 01:27:07,950
[SPEAKER_17]: Absolutely.

917
01:27:08,030 --> 01:27:08,350
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

918
01:27:10,136 --> 01:27:11,918
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

919
01:27:14,260 --> 01:27:20,646
[SPEAKER_14]: I just wanted to say, you know, this sounds so exciting and there's so many offerings and it's terrific.

920
01:27:20,766 --> 01:27:26,971
[SPEAKER_14]: The staff that you mentioned, the 20 to 28 staff members who have already, you know, their willingness to participate in the program.

921
01:27:27,792 --> 01:27:30,454
[SPEAKER_14]: It just sounds incredible and it's very exciting.

922
01:27:31,715 --> 01:27:32,116
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

923
01:27:34,348 --> 01:27:37,431
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, Memocrats, I can't see your light, just like I can't see Ms.

924
01:27:37,471 --> 01:27:40,133
[SPEAKER_06]: McLaughlin, Member McLaughlin.

925
01:27:41,374 --> 01:27:50,002
[SPEAKER_06]: Number six, we have a budget update by Assistant Superintendent of Finance and Operations, Mr. David Murphy, will provide an update on the Medford Public Schools budget.

926
01:28:01,451 --> 01:28:01,832
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello again.

927
01:28:03,967 --> 01:28:13,469
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to ask Dr. Cushing to put the short deck up on your screen, and then I'll explain to you best I can what that is.

928
01:28:14,789 --> 01:28:20,550
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thought it was only when the blower was on.

929
01:28:22,971 --> 01:28:27,032
[SPEAKER_01]: So the committee voted several weeks ago to

930
01:28:28,814 --> 01:28:37,437
[SPEAKER_01]: for a budget update in January to do as best as we could to start the description of the FY23 budget process.

931
01:28:38,377 --> 01:28:45,240
[SPEAKER_01]: You are also due this evening a quarterly update as we provided in October following the conclusion of the first quarter of the fiscal year.

932
01:28:45,680 --> 01:28:48,963
[SPEAKER_01]: The second quarter of the fiscal year is now concluded, so we're halfway through FY22.

933
01:28:49,504 --> 01:28:58,232
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm going to try to accomplish or fulfill both requests this evening and give you a quick update as to where we are in FY22.

934
01:28:58,472 --> 01:29:00,534
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you'll recall from last year,

935
01:29:02,155 --> 01:29:08,439
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't begin the process of discussing the succeeding fiscal year without understanding where we're sort of leading up.

936
01:29:08,539 --> 01:29:19,446
[SPEAKER_01]: So some of this is just recap and summary, and then we will get to some of the considerations that we'll be asking the committee to look at as we head into the budget development process for FY23.

937
01:29:19,886 --> 01:29:29,492
[SPEAKER_01]: So before you is our operating budget number that is inclusive of the ARPA funding that was approved by this body and then ultimately the city council in June of 2015.

938
01:29:31,580 --> 01:29:46,566
[SPEAKER_01]: 21, and we'll get into the process itself in the timeline at the conclusion of this as we look at FY23, but just so everyone understands, that is our budget, inclusive of ARPA, not inclusive of the ESSER funding, which we will also touch upon in this presentation.

939
01:29:46,666 --> 01:29:53,729
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we move through, the next slide just discusses where we are currently, and this looks similar to the

940
01:29:54,349 --> 01:29:57,833
[SPEAKER_01]: update you received in October after the conclusion of the first quarter.

941
01:29:57,853 --> 01:30:06,422
[SPEAKER_01]: If you recall in that presentation we focused on some of the unanticipated expenses that were realized during the first fiscal quarter.

942
01:30:06,462 --> 01:30:12,689
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the three additional kindergarten teachers and some of the other staff that were identified as needs in the summer of 2021 and then

943
01:30:14,170 --> 01:30:15,992
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, early, early fall, 2021.

944
01:30:16,472 --> 01:30:26,680
[SPEAKER_01]: So here you have essentially our financial position today, which, um, the short version, I would just say it is our financial position is, is favorable right now with regard to where we are in the fiscal year.

945
01:30:26,700 --> 01:30:31,584
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, however, as has been the case throughout the fiscal year, we still have open collective bargaining agreements.

946
01:30:32,184 --> 01:30:37,408
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, our negotiations with those, uh, units are, are, uh, for the most part underway right now.

947
01:30:37,428 --> 01:30:39,790
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've been in contact with each bargaining unit,

948
01:30:40,510 --> 01:30:42,031
[SPEAKER_01]: just within the last month.

949
01:30:42,111 --> 01:30:56,180
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I would hope that before your next quarterly update, some of those negotiations will have progressed, but that will obviously narrow the, presumably will narrow the financial cushion that we're currently

950
01:30:56,740 --> 01:30:59,782
[SPEAKER_01]: working in with regard to our current financial position.

951
01:31:00,482 --> 01:31:16,570
[SPEAKER_01]: The potential unanticipated maintenance expenses, they're unanticipated, so it's hard to identify them with specificity right now, but that's part of why we want, at this point in the fiscal year, to have some degree of insulation between us and what our final number will ultimately end up being.

952
01:31:17,210 --> 01:31:20,692
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that third bullet, CARES Act and ESSER priority considerations.

953
01:31:21,712 --> 01:31:38,492
[SPEAKER_01]: You know that in FY, certainly in FY 21, and to some extent I imagine FY 20, but for FY 21 and FY 22, we've been the beneficiary of several external funding, a significant amount of external funding that has come in and has offset some of our expenses.

954
01:31:40,114 --> 01:31:53,818
[SPEAKER_01]: There will, in each of the upcoming budget deliberation processes, be opportunities to determine whether or not there are some priorities that have been funded by some of these external funds that could, in the view of the committee, be incorporated into our operating budget.

955
01:31:54,238 --> 01:32:01,860
[SPEAKER_01]: I list them here as just something that we need to start to think about, because what we don't want to do is get to the end of those external funds.

956
01:32:01,880 --> 01:32:07,341
[SPEAKER_01]: And to be fair, we're, in most cases, at least two fiscal years away from the expiration of those funds.

957
01:32:07,781 --> 01:32:09,362
[SPEAKER_01]: But we want to start thinking about

958
01:32:09,802 --> 01:32:16,228
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there things currently right now that we are supporting with those external funds that we may ultimately want to adopt, incorporate into our budget?

959
01:32:16,528 --> 01:32:26,037
[SPEAKER_01]: And there will be some strategic thinking and decision-making that has to occur when that moment arrives, because there are things right now that we would not be able to absorb.

960
01:32:28,319 --> 01:32:31,421
[SPEAKER_01]: under our current financial structure.

961
01:32:31,441 --> 01:32:35,404
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, as you see, there's other anticipated challenges.

962
01:32:35,904 --> 01:32:40,227
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we move on to the next slide, this number has fluctuated to some degree in the last year.

963
01:32:40,347 --> 01:32:50,194
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, including some of the priorities that were just identified for you in our previous presentation, we would anticipate approximately $1.4 million being spent from the ESSER funding.

964
01:32:50,834 --> 01:32:51,475
[SPEAKER_01]: This will not,

965
01:32:53,316 --> 01:32:59,803
[SPEAKER_01]: based on this projection, we would essentially be leaving the ESSER III funding untapped going into FY23.

966
01:32:59,923 --> 01:33:04,468
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe it's a $2.3 million, it's either 2.3 or 2.7.

967
01:33:04,508 --> 01:33:09,354
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd have to go back and look at that for ESSER II, but there'd be a significant amount of funding that would roll over.

968
01:33:09,834 --> 01:33:19,949
[SPEAKER_01]: into FY23 for additional programs like extended school days, like summer programming in the summer of 2022, which is something that we're in the early stages of developing right now.

969
01:33:20,409 --> 01:33:25,977
[SPEAKER_01]: And then potentially additional COVID mitigation strategies, depending on what the state of the pandemic is at that time.

970
01:33:26,638 --> 01:33:32,185
[SPEAKER_01]: If we go to the next slide, just the highlighted boxes are some of the things that have changed since your last quarterly update.

971
01:33:32,285 --> 01:33:40,414
[SPEAKER_01]: This reflects the additional Camp Mustang funding that was just discussed, the adoption of the COVID clinics in addition to the COVID testing.

972
01:33:41,396 --> 01:33:46,341
[SPEAKER_01]: That number was offset to some degree, but through some additional CARES Act funding that we were able to

973
01:33:47,162 --> 01:33:52,988
[SPEAKER_01]: partner with the city on so that the COVID testing and vaccination clinic isn't as high as it could have been.

974
01:33:53,748 --> 01:34:06,581
[SPEAKER_01]: It was TBD at the time, the MAP initiative that you've also heard about this evening, and some of those other numbers had some minor fluctuations, but ultimately that's how we've broken down our ESSER priorities.

975
01:34:07,341 --> 01:34:10,265
[SPEAKER_01]: which is very consistent with the vision that was laid out for you in the spring.

976
01:34:10,285 --> 01:34:18,236
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's still obviously, there's much more that we would like to invest in, particularly with regard to some of the remedial and acceleration strategies.

977
01:34:19,097 --> 01:34:22,361
[SPEAKER_01]: I put the transportation initiative in yellow because that is something that

978
01:34:23,242 --> 01:34:27,885
[SPEAKER_01]: We will need to return to the committee for direction on in the near future.

979
01:34:28,965 --> 01:34:34,809
[SPEAKER_01]: The committee directed the administration to expand the free transportation options available to students at Medford High School.

980
01:34:36,249 --> 01:34:50,718
[SPEAKER_01]: We have done that through essentially funding MBTA passes through the ESSER funding, which we think is a good resource and a good strategy in that it's giving access to that transportation service to more students.

981
01:34:52,158 --> 01:35:01,224
[SPEAKER_01]: The hope to expand the yellow bus transportation has run into some of the workforce challenges that have affected the rest of the organization as well.

982
01:35:01,744 --> 01:35:09,469
[SPEAKER_01]: It is something that we need to explore in the next month or two to get a census to the committee's views.

983
01:35:12,558 --> 01:35:21,903
[SPEAKER_01]: The ESSER funding, as I said, will roll over in FY23, and it is an option to continue to use this resource, but it's not one that's gonna last in perpetuity.

984
01:35:22,023 --> 01:35:30,588
[SPEAKER_01]: And so eventually the district will need to adopt a different strategy if we are to keep the expanded transportation options.

985
01:35:30,688 --> 01:35:34,229
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's just sort of putting a pin in that for future discussion.

986
01:35:35,210 --> 01:35:36,651
[SPEAKER_01]: As we move along,

987
01:35:38,361 --> 01:35:45,387
[SPEAKER_01]: These are budget priorities and also the sort of initial list of potential budgetary priorities going into FY23.

988
01:35:45,447 --> 01:35:58,577
[SPEAKER_01]: This is in many respects a continuation of the strategies and priorities that you've heard us discuss in the past, and they're all connected to the goals as outlined in the strategic plan that the superintendent referenced just a few minutes ago.

989
01:35:59,956 --> 01:36:08,981
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as we head toward the FY 23 planning and the next slide, again, these are some of the things that we'll have to look at in the very near future.

990
01:36:10,141 --> 01:36:17,525
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of which I've discussed tonight from a procedural perspective, and I'll talk about this in a minute when we get to the last one, but as of

991
01:36:18,412 --> 01:36:26,955
[SPEAKER_01]: Late morning, the governor had not released his initial budgetary proposals with the, unless the mayor has other information.

992
01:36:26,975 --> 01:36:33,377
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that changed the last few hours, but the state of the state is scheduled for tomorrow, and typically it's in line with that.

993
01:36:33,437 --> 01:36:41,000
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we go to the last one, this is a slide that you've seen many times before with regard to the overall budgetary timeline.

994
01:36:42,692 --> 01:36:50,158
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's sort of three points that I just wanted to make as we have our initial thought process with regard to the FY23 budget development.

995
01:36:53,880 --> 01:37:06,326
[SPEAKER_01]: First one, the first point is that we don't have any numbers to work with as of yet because the state process has not started to unfold, but we would anticipate that that will happen soon.

996
01:37:06,366 --> 01:37:18,853
[SPEAKER_01]: But as the committee knows from years past, whatever the governor announces, presumably this week, will then go to the legislature and there'll be a host of changes that will go back and forth at the state level between now and then.

997
01:37:19,982 --> 01:37:29,245
[SPEAKER_01]: There are several of the variables with regard to our external funding, the city's ARPA funding and our ESSA funding that will have to be a part of your deliberation as we move toward the adoption of an FY23 budget.

998
01:37:30,345 --> 01:37:45,050
[SPEAKER_01]: The committee indicated when you asked for information related to FY23 in the month of January, that you were looking for a conversation about how you wanted this process to play out.

999
01:37:45,170 --> 01:37:49,171
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the first arrow pointing up there is at the committee of the whole meetings.

1000
01:37:49,719 --> 01:38:10,297
[SPEAKER_01]: And so just from a process perspective, last year, and as I understand it in previous years, the committee has convened a series of committee of the whole meetings in which the district has presented, district administration has presented essentially a piece by piece version of the budget in which

1001
01:38:11,097 --> 01:38:20,886
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the academic departments and several of the operational departments have presented information to you subsequent to our internal vetting and deliberation process.

1002
01:38:22,187 --> 01:38:31,275
[SPEAKER_01]: My impression from multiple committee members last year was that this may be a process that we want to look at both to see if there might be a way to both make it more efficient

1003
01:38:31,715 --> 01:38:52,278
[SPEAKER_01]: and helpful to community members who are looking to have as much information about the budget process and our budgetary priorities as possible but delivered in a way that's effective for really conveying the core strategic priorities of the district and I would say the feedback that I received both from some community members and from members of the committee in the course of the past year

1004
01:38:52,758 --> 01:39:12,193
[SPEAKER_01]: was that there is a sense that six two to three hour committee of the whole meeting squeezed into a two week window may not be the most effective way to retain a captive audience and convey that information in a way that truly provides useful information to members of the community.

1005
01:39:12,894 --> 01:39:20,800
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say that I think the other risk factor is that the

1006
01:39:21,792 --> 01:39:39,716
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think the process as we orchestrated it last year did give the committee a relatively unvarnished perspective on all of the competing priorities that the administration has to grapple with over the course of the budget process.

1007
01:39:40,496 --> 01:39:49,118
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know that it actually conveyed the most accurate depiction of how we were developing priorities and how the superintendent was ultimately making her

1008
01:39:49,757 --> 01:39:53,578
[SPEAKER_01]: recommendations to you with regard to a budgetary request.

1009
01:39:53,598 --> 01:40:17,605
[SPEAKER_01]: There were multiple instances in which, and I think this was all done in good faith, I don't think it was anything nefarious, but there were multiple instances in which there were personnel testifying before you and offering information that may be somewhat accurate, but was not necessarily consistent with the total picture of budgetary priorities that the administration was in the process of developing.

1010
01:40:19,605 --> 01:40:22,272
[SPEAKER_01]: we will present whatever information the committee thinks is useful.

1011
01:40:23,114 --> 01:40:24,898
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think for both of those reasons.

1012
01:40:25,981 --> 01:40:27,144
[SPEAKER_01]: There is the possibility that

1013
01:40:27,926 --> 01:40:40,729
[SPEAKER_01]: providing the volume of information that we did over the course of as many evenings as we did, it may not actually be portraying a more inaccurate narrative as to what it is that we're trying to achieve with the budget process.

1014
01:40:40,769 --> 01:40:54,252
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's sort of a byproduct of a budget in which something close to 80 to 85% of the funding has already been tied to through previous commitments of other contracts and collective bargaining agreements and things of that nature.

1015
01:40:55,888 --> 01:41:15,285
[SPEAKER_01]: I genuinely do defer to the committee as to whether or not you want to stick with the six committee of the whole meetings or if the committee has particular areas that you are concerned about and would like to be able to ascertain how the administration is formulating recommendations that are responsive to those priorities and those requests.

1016
01:41:15,925 --> 01:41:17,927
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we probably could develop something that

1017
01:41:19,843 --> 01:41:27,108
[SPEAKER_01]: could be more efficient, and I think ultimately convey a more accurate narrative as to what exactly it is that we are presenting.

1018
01:41:27,168 --> 01:41:35,734
[SPEAKER_01]: If I could just, if we could just have that last slide for one second, because that explanation was about one of those arrows, and I just want to point out to the second one, if I could.

1019
01:41:36,855 --> 01:41:37,135
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1020
01:41:38,043 --> 01:41:42,165
[SPEAKER_01]: that arrow pointing down to the bottom row, second from the left.

1021
01:41:43,046 --> 01:41:58,233
[SPEAKER_01]: This was a point that we discussed at each of those committee of the whole meetings and in the meetings preceding the committee of the whole meetings and superintendent in my testimony before the city council, but in my experience, I think it's a point that we really can't make enough times.

1022
01:41:59,074 --> 01:42:07,018
[SPEAKER_01]: The vote that you take based on the superintendent's recommendation is a request to the municipal government.

1023
01:42:07,681 --> 01:42:19,350
[SPEAKER_01]: The municipal government made up of the mayor as the representative of the executive branch and the municipal council need to take that request and look at it in the context of all of the various competing priorities and issues.

1024
01:42:19,410 --> 01:42:31,459
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what you heard us say over and over again during that budget process is that we are formulating recommendations to you based on our needs and priorities and what we need to do to make the superintendent strategic plan a reality.

1025
01:42:31,960 --> 01:42:35,563
[SPEAKER_01]: We also understand that while we have that obligation to the school committee,

1026
01:42:36,054 --> 01:42:44,082
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have the obligation to make the plan for every contingency and to be prepared to deliver on the mission based on the resources that we have.

1027
01:42:44,142 --> 01:42:52,852
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I don't want it to seem as though we're speaking out of both sides of our mouth by saying we need X amount, but then also saying that we can make progress with Y amount.

1028
01:42:53,312 --> 01:42:57,957
[SPEAKER_01]: But that is the nature of this process in which you as an autonomous governing body have the opportunity to

1029
01:42:58,741 --> 01:43:10,147
[SPEAKER_01]: advocate on behalf of the school communities and to make that request to the municipal government, understanding full well that the municipal government has a full city worth of priorities that do have to be met.

1030
01:43:10,387 --> 01:43:17,871
[SPEAKER_01]: And we will, as the administrators of the district, act in good faith to deliver for the students based on the budget that is ultimately appropriated.

1031
01:43:17,931 --> 01:43:27,236
[SPEAKER_01]: But both things are true, that we have an obligation to advocate zealously for what we believe would be the best possible budget and then work within

1032
01:43:28,457 --> 01:43:30,118
[SPEAKER_01]: the appropriation that is ultimately made.

1033
01:43:30,198 --> 01:43:35,440
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's again it's a point that I've learned you can't make it enough times.

1034
01:43:36,621 --> 01:43:41,863
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's one that I imagine from time to time reference throughout the upcoming budget process.

1035
01:43:42,803 --> 01:43:44,524
[SPEAKER_01]: With that I'm happy to take your questions.

1036
01:43:44,584 --> 01:43:44,884
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1037
01:43:45,425 --> 01:43:46,165
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mister Murphy.

1038
01:43:50,907 --> 01:43:52,488
[SPEAKER_08]: Member McLaughlin.

1039
01:43:53,248 --> 01:43:53,728
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1040
01:43:53,908 --> 01:43:55,409
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mister Murphy for the report.

1041
01:43:56,572 --> 01:44:06,119
[SPEAKER_17]: So I guess I'm wondering what the proposed process would be, because I think that the motion was that we were gonna start scheduling in January.

1042
01:44:06,199 --> 01:44:12,804
[SPEAKER_17]: So if there's a different process as not six COW meetings, for example, what is that process?

1043
01:44:12,864 --> 01:44:15,006
[SPEAKER_17]: And when do we actually think that that's gonna be scheduled?

1044
01:44:15,026 --> 01:44:24,233
[SPEAKER_17]: Because we were really looking at, if I understood correctly, being able to have some idea of where we were and what we were asking, especially regarding

1045
01:44:25,573 --> 01:44:29,038
[SPEAKER_17]: hiring practices so that we could be competitive, among other things.

1046
01:44:29,118 --> 01:44:33,766
[SPEAKER_17]: But I know that we also have, for example, a motion on the calendar for tonight regarding

1047
01:44:36,994 --> 01:44:41,356
[SPEAKER_17]: a particular class around summer programming, like, you know, what was the last summer programming?

1048
01:44:41,436 --> 01:44:46,438
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, how are we, what is the process that you're proposing and when do you propose it?

1049
01:44:46,978 --> 01:44:49,059
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so there's two questions there.

1050
01:44:49,359 --> 01:45:00,323
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I will, I'll just reiterate the point that I made at the time that the committee asked for this presentation is that it is 100% true and it is fully within our plans to

1051
01:45:01,003 --> 01:45:05,605
[SPEAKER_01]: decouple the hiring process with the budget process.

1052
01:45:06,025 --> 01:45:26,856
[SPEAKER_01]: That is not to say we are going to hire a bunch of positions that we cannot fund, but there have been historically, in my estimation, and I believe it's a feeling that is shared certainly by the hiring administrators, because it's a point that they've made over and over again since I arrived, we have held the posting of positions that

1053
01:45:27,797 --> 01:45:41,348
[SPEAKER_01]: In some cases are just backfilling positions that exist until the budget process moves along and it is putting us at a huge disadvantage with other districts now.

1054
01:45:42,148 --> 01:45:48,273
[SPEAKER_01]: It is always possible that we will post recruit higher.

1055
01:45:48,995 --> 01:45:57,320
[SPEAKER_01]: and then have an unexpected budget crisis that would lead to a difficult set of decisions that we have to make in the late spring or over the summer.

1056
01:45:57,360 --> 01:45:58,961
[SPEAKER_01]: That's always a possibility.

1057
01:46:00,402 --> 01:46:03,024
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are also some presumptions that we can make.

1058
01:46:06,583 --> 01:46:08,864
[SPEAKER_01]: we should make them so that we can be more competitive.

1059
01:46:08,884 --> 01:46:22,328
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think my first answer is we are going to decouple that process and the core positions that we know that we have year in and year out, we are going to assume that we are not going to have a historic financial crisis that occurs in the late spring.

1060
01:46:22,388 --> 01:46:23,388
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to say that.

1061
01:46:24,008 --> 01:46:26,229
[SPEAKER_01]: and cause that type of disruption.

1062
01:46:26,809 --> 01:46:30,711
[SPEAKER_01]: With regard to the process, I'm not really recommending a specific process.

1063
01:46:30,911 --> 01:46:33,172
[SPEAKER_01]: I am, because it's not, I don't know that that's my place to do.

1064
01:46:33,232 --> 01:46:36,434
[SPEAKER_01]: This is, it's your community's budget process.

1065
01:46:36,514 --> 01:46:38,255
[SPEAKER_01]: It's your budget as a school committee.

1066
01:46:38,635 --> 01:46:40,636
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll present whatever information you ask for.

1067
01:46:41,476 --> 01:46:49,320
[SPEAKER_01]: The feedback I received in part from members was that the sort of repetition of,

1068
01:46:51,092 --> 01:47:07,831
[SPEAKER_01]: Each principal and each director showing up and mostly staying on script doesn't necessarily convey in the most effective manner what are the core strategic and budgetary priorities that the district is looking to advocate for.

1069
01:47:08,431 --> 01:47:17,879
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think to the degree that part of the budget process is to give the school department the opportunity to position itself to most effectively advocate for investment from the community.

1070
01:47:18,899 --> 01:47:28,747
[SPEAKER_01]: I do think we're sort of missing the mark a little bit on that, but there are other reasons to do it exactly as we've done it.

1071
01:47:29,248 --> 01:47:33,191
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an opportunity for anyone who wants to sit through 15 hours of meetings.

1072
01:47:33,751 --> 01:47:37,114
[SPEAKER_01]: You can hear about just about every single piece of the budget,

1073
01:47:37,975 --> 01:47:44,504
[SPEAKER_01]: The point that I make is that 80% of it is going to be the same as it's been before, because it's fixed costs that are already tied up in vendor agreements or collective bargaining agreements.

1074
01:47:44,544 --> 01:47:51,733
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there is a limitation as to what exactly it is that we can sort of debate and deliberate over.

1075
01:47:51,773 --> 01:47:55,498
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's the part where I think it's not necessarily the most effective messaging.

1076
01:47:57,527 --> 01:48:15,055
[SPEAKER_01]: Short of a recommendation, what I would say is if there are components of the budget that you would like us to present and to give detailed information as to how and why we're investing the way that we are, I think that should be the focus of our conversation and that would be the information that we would present.

1077
01:48:16,115 --> 01:48:23,299
[SPEAKER_01]: And beyond that, it would be an overall picture as to how it is we plan to spend the community's money.

1078
01:48:24,419 --> 01:48:25,460
[SPEAKER_01]: And with regard to timeline,

1079
01:48:26,440 --> 01:48:36,806
[SPEAKER_01]: Last year, we did late April, which, you know, I know it may sound late, except that like the process that led to a fairly significant investment.

1080
01:48:36,826 --> 01:48:39,528
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think there's an argument that it was effective.

1081
01:48:39,608 --> 01:48:49,433
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if we do it earlier than March, there's gonna be a lot of unanswered questions, particularly at the state level and beyond, frankly.

1082
01:48:50,154 --> 01:48:52,555
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think that that's a challenge.

1083
01:48:52,575 --> 01:48:53,656
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know that it's,

1084
01:48:55,080 --> 01:49:02,166
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it's late April or early, excuse me, late March, early to mid April, seems like the right window.

1085
01:49:03,307 --> 01:49:06,109
[SPEAKER_01]: But like I said, ultimately we're going to do what the committee asked for.

1086
01:49:10,252 --> 01:49:12,134
[SPEAKER_17]: So, yeah, I guess,

1087
01:49:13,450 --> 01:49:25,993
[SPEAKER_17]: We need to have, I would recommend a motion for a committee of the whole meeting to discuss what the project process is going to be since we can't really talk out of school committee meetings with each other about what that looks like beyond three of us.

1088
01:49:26,633 --> 01:49:33,555
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know how we move this forward without having a further discussion about what this actually looks like.

1089
01:49:34,816 --> 01:49:40,377
[SPEAKER_17]: So I guess I would recommend making a motion for a committee of the whole to discuss what the budget process will actually be.

1090
01:49:41,238 --> 01:49:45,910
[SPEAKER_17]: So that we do have a better understanding of the process and the schedule for it.

1091
01:49:45,950 --> 01:49:47,033
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't even have the number yet.

1092
01:49:47,053 --> 01:49:48,537
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe we could get the most.

1093
01:49:49,347 --> 01:49:54,509
[SPEAKER_06]: efficient and accurate process emailed to us so we wouldn't have to.

1094
01:49:54,529 --> 01:49:55,269
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to be clear.

1095
01:49:55,329 --> 01:49:59,370
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it's the case that we don't know what the budget process is.

1096
01:50:01,611 --> 01:50:12,415
[SPEAKER_01]: The budget process is we're going to articulate to the committee a series of recommendations about how to best prioritize this community's investment in education.

1097
01:50:12,995 --> 01:50:18,377
[SPEAKER_01]: And it will be a more multifaceted presentation than it would be certainly without that

1098
01:50:19,115 --> 01:50:25,080
[SPEAKER_01]: influx of external funds, which we will still have available to us, at least for the next couple of fiscal years.

1099
01:50:27,501 --> 01:50:45,735
[SPEAKER_01]: What I would like would be to have the opportunity to hear from the committee about what are some of those priorities so that we don't show up with a set of recommendations that is wholly inconsistent with what the committee is looking to hear from us.

1100
01:50:47,643 --> 01:51:07,270
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it is 6 Committee of the Whole meetings or 2 Committee of the Whole meetings, one focused on instruction and one focused on operations, or one very long meeting in which we go through in the level of detail that the committee asked for, either one of those would be perfectly acceptable from the administration's perspective.

1101
01:51:09,470 --> 01:51:14,452
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just pretty much depending on when it happens, we will have more information.

1102
01:51:15,025 --> 01:51:19,087
[SPEAKER_01]: from the state to determine what a reasonable scope might be.

1103
01:51:20,348 --> 01:51:21,689
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Ruseau, then Member Graham.

1104
01:51:22,489 --> 01:51:23,550
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1105
01:51:24,550 --> 01:51:30,354
[SPEAKER_12]: The number of meetings, I mean, I'm not particularly in love with any particular number.

1106
01:51:30,934 --> 01:51:38,018
[SPEAKER_12]: I do want us to stop having the directors and the principals putting on a dog and pony show because

1107
01:51:39,140 --> 01:51:48,482
[SPEAKER_12]: as we have discussed, it puts them in a really awkward position, you know, in that, well, they don't work for us.

1108
01:51:49,103 --> 01:51:50,763
[SPEAKER_12]: They work for the superintendent.

1109
01:51:51,543 --> 01:51:57,865
[SPEAKER_12]: And we are supposed to articulate the goals that the superintendent is expected to meet.

1110
01:52:00,646 --> 01:52:07,011
[SPEAKER_12]: And we're supposed to trust that, well, not trust, but trust and verify that she is meeting those goals.

1111
01:52:07,231 --> 01:52:11,494
[SPEAKER_12]: We are not supposed to be saying to each principal what they should be doing.

1112
01:52:12,214 --> 01:52:14,716
[SPEAKER_12]: It's, in fact, not appropriate.

1113
01:52:16,412 --> 01:52:16,993
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.

1114
01:52:17,493 --> 01:52:20,035
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's part of what I'm saying, I think.

1115
01:52:20,975 --> 01:52:28,841
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, in order for us to formulate the recommendations that the committee wants, I do think we need a forum for you to provide that feedback and to ask the questions.

1116
01:52:29,181 --> 01:52:31,863
[SPEAKER_01]: The strategic plan is the starting place for that, right?

1117
01:52:31,923 --> 01:52:38,087
[SPEAKER_01]: You've adopted that as the blueprint as to what are the goals that you're expecting us as an administration to follow.

1118
01:52:38,147 --> 01:52:43,911
[SPEAKER_01]: But in every fiscal year, there are going to be a different level of specificity and manifestations of that.

1119
01:52:44,311 --> 01:52:53,176
[SPEAKER_01]: And my hope would be that the forum that you would use would be using that strategic plan as a guide to tell us what you want the budgetary priorities to be.

1120
01:52:53,796 --> 01:52:56,638
[SPEAKER_01]: And it also helps us to say if something's not going to be

1121
01:52:57,462 --> 01:53:03,167
[SPEAKER_01]: In FY 23, a budgetary priority, we have an obligation to provide a rationale as to why that's the case.

1122
01:53:03,528 --> 01:53:06,951
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect example being, at least perfect example for last year.

1123
01:53:07,331 --> 01:53:13,437
[SPEAKER_01]: We just had a conversation today that we may, our position may evolve on this, but there was questions about the instructional coaches.

1124
01:53:14,118 --> 01:53:16,520
[SPEAKER_01]: Instructional coaches would be a key part of advancing

1125
01:53:17,100 --> 01:53:31,575
[SPEAKER_01]: strategic plan but as we explained in the budget process there were two or three steps necessary to build in the institutional capacity where we could say to you this is a good use of these resources as compared to these other options and we weren't prepared in the spring of 2021

1126
01:53:33,528 --> 01:53:37,810
[SPEAKER_01]: to advance that specific set of budgetary priorities because there was groundwork we wanted to lay in.

1127
01:53:37,831 --> 01:53:39,792
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't mean it's not inconsistent with the strategic plan.

1128
01:53:40,152 --> 01:53:47,716
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that it's not consistent with executing this element of the strategic plan at this particular time, which is what I think the budgetary process is really designed to do.

1129
01:53:47,916 --> 01:54:02,484
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, as the school committee, you could say, that's fine, that sounds rational, but we want to see in this budget exactly what you're going to do and what we need to pay for to provide that groundwork so that if we can't do this next year,

1130
01:54:03,120 --> 01:54:06,062
[SPEAKER_01]: we can do it the year after or at least on a timeline that you can articulate.

1131
01:54:06,462 --> 01:54:08,203
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the conversation I think that we need to have.

1132
01:54:09,044 --> 01:54:09,384
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1133
01:54:09,584 --> 01:54:27,635
[SPEAKER_12]: And so, you know, when I think about the things that I want, I mean, I want to know that students participating in sports and band and that there is an equitable spending on that, that we are not spending a fortune on sports buses and nothing on band buses.

1134
01:54:28,280 --> 01:54:29,880
[SPEAKER_12]: Those are the kinds of things I want to know.

1135
01:54:30,061 --> 01:54:34,262
[SPEAKER_12]: And I just want to be able to see in black and white, yes, it's happening.

1136
01:54:35,162 --> 01:54:37,063
[SPEAKER_12]: And a check mark, I'm literally fine.

1137
01:54:37,143 --> 01:54:52,907
[SPEAKER_12]: If you can prove that all students, regardless of whether it's sports or band, are getting access to the tax dollars that we're providing equally, because it is not happening now and nobody can convince me otherwise, then

1138
01:54:55,023 --> 01:54:59,524
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, that's like something I feel like we could just wrap up and stop talking about in budgets.

1139
01:54:59,724 --> 01:55:10,927
[SPEAKER_12]: Instead, I'm sitting here taking multiple teacher contracts and the payments to coaches, and I'm trying to figure out how many students and I don't have that information.

1140
01:55:11,467 --> 01:55:22,750
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm trying to do all this like magical division in math and creating a spreadsheet that doesn't make any damn sense and cobble together information to try to intuit it.

1141
01:55:23,382 --> 01:55:51,024
[SPEAKER_12]: And I understand that the accounting system isn't really helpful here, in that it's all over the place, and some of it's in community schools, and some of it's in student account fees, and some of it's, it's just that it feels like, you know, this is year five for me, and, you know, it's year five of wondering, are we ever gonna let all the kids be treated like they're valued, instead of sports always getting everything?

1142
01:55:51,927 --> 01:56:07,117
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'll put, I'm gonna not respond to specifics about, all kids are valued, all kids are, we as an organization, we do strive to treat every kid equally, but is that vision realized day in and day out for every single kid?

1143
01:56:07,157 --> 01:56:10,820
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a different question, but that's why we have to show up for work every day and work toward that goal.

1144
01:56:10,840 --> 01:56:19,886
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think what you're suggesting is perhaps there could be one forum in which we would discuss the budgetary priorities and proposals

1145
01:56:20,406 --> 01:56:23,549
[SPEAKER_01]: through the lens of equity specifically, because that's really what you're talking about, right?

1146
01:56:23,889 --> 01:56:37,501
[SPEAKER_01]: So not just here's four directors and the departments they represent, but rather here's how we as an administration see this budget from an equity perspective and some of the changes or ways in which we are addressing to make it more equitable.

1147
01:56:37,601 --> 01:56:40,083
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that would be a perfectly appropriate conversation.

1148
01:56:40,705 --> 01:56:56,349
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, frankly, what I'm thinking when you're saying this, Mr. Hsieh, is if a member of the school, someone who's been on the school committee for five years, isn't getting necessarily what he needs out of this presentation that we're doing year in and year out, I have to imagine they're members of the community that aren't feeling fully informed either.

1149
01:56:56,789 --> 01:57:01,950
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I would suggest perhaps we could package this in a way that could be delivered more effectively.

1150
01:57:01,970 --> 01:57:02,570
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, I think

1151
01:57:03,270 --> 01:57:11,096
[SPEAKER_01]: One is we need to hear from you as to looking at the strategic plan, what are the pieces that you would anticipate being incorporated in the FY23 budget?

1152
01:57:11,436 --> 01:57:15,720
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not to say we're gonna come back and just spit it back at you and say, see, we did exactly what you asked.

1153
01:57:16,060 --> 01:57:25,907
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of it may be a conversation about why we, as the people administering this budget day in and day out, don't think some of those priorities are ready to move and here's the rationale.

1154
01:57:26,108 --> 01:57:31,612
[SPEAKER_01]: Others will say, okay, we have some choices to make and the governing body of the school system has said this is what they would like to see.

1155
01:57:32,032 --> 01:57:33,673
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is frankly what we tried to do last year.

1156
01:57:34,053 --> 01:57:36,134
[SPEAKER_01]: We tried to be as responsive as possible to that.

1157
01:57:37,074 --> 01:57:40,975
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easier, frankly, now than before, given the external funding availability.

1158
01:57:41,736 --> 01:57:52,280
[SPEAKER_01]: But in addition to hearing from you, I think setting some parameters around some of these meetings, rather than just wheeling out everyone who works here, I think would make a lot of sense.

1159
01:57:53,395 --> 01:57:59,961
[SPEAKER_01]: One, how we're making sure that this budget is being organized and executed in an equitable fashion.

1160
01:58:00,501 --> 01:58:03,183
[SPEAKER_01]: Perhaps another is based on contingencies.

1161
01:58:03,624 --> 01:58:07,147
[SPEAKER_01]: And here are the four things that we don't expect we will invest in this year.

1162
01:58:07,167 --> 01:58:13,452
[SPEAKER_01]: But if something works out either better or worse than we're anticipating, these are the priorities that we might prioritize.

1163
01:58:13,492 --> 01:58:15,214
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a variety of other ways in which we could do it.

1164
01:58:15,234 --> 01:58:18,156
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think this would be more fruitful to me than just

1165
01:58:21,125 --> 01:58:25,828
[SPEAKER_01]: reprinting the same PowerPoints from what I can tell has just been around four or five years at least.

1166
01:58:26,928 --> 01:58:27,209
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1167
01:58:28,709 --> 01:58:29,130
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1168
01:58:29,910 --> 01:58:32,111
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Graham.

1169
01:58:33,993 --> 01:58:39,176
[SPEAKER_15]: There have been instances in the past where the administration has sort of sought our

1170
01:58:40,467 --> 01:58:59,518
[SPEAKER_15]: input, and we've been able to individually provide that input on whatever topic it was to you, and then you've had the ability to then see sort of across the spectrum of everybody's priorities, what are we all saying, and then come back to us with

1171
01:59:01,237 --> 01:59:02,778
[SPEAKER_15]: a presentation or a recommendation.

1172
01:59:02,878 --> 01:59:11,602
[SPEAKER_15]: And it seems to me like that's really what we need to accomplish here is we all individually need to be able to tell you what is important to us.

1173
01:59:12,383 --> 01:59:16,445
[SPEAKER_15]: And then honestly, there's going to be lots of overlap, right?

1174
01:59:17,285 --> 01:59:20,667
[SPEAKER_15]: Across the committee in various ways.

1175
01:59:20,907 --> 01:59:23,328
[SPEAKER_15]: And then you need to come and present a budget to us.

1176
01:59:23,408 --> 01:59:30,212
[SPEAKER_15]: So I sort of am a fan of the notion that you would collect that input from us individually,

1177
01:59:32,242 --> 01:59:53,862
[SPEAKER_15]: and then you would present to us on night and maybe we'd like cancel the second school committee meeting in March and instead we do budget night and you come to us and you say on the you know at the what would normally be the second school committee meeting here here is our set of priorities here is what the budget looks like and then as committee members

1178
01:59:54,763 --> 02:00:03,071
[SPEAKER_15]: if I've said these are my 10 things that I want to see in the budget, you've covered eight of them, I don't have to talk about eight of the 10 things.

1179
02:00:03,952 --> 02:00:18,705
[SPEAKER_15]: And I do want to, I do want to hear the cohesive message from the superintendent about where the district is going, because I think the other thing that has happened, that happens in those committee of the wholes,

1180
02:00:19,681 --> 02:00:29,986
[SPEAKER_15]: is people react to the information they're being given, which may or may not actually be material to formulating, like, what do you think about the budget?

1181
02:00:30,766 --> 02:00:31,967
[SPEAKER_15]: And I do think that happens.

1182
02:00:32,067 --> 02:00:43,173
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's a point, like, I think a lot of people view those meetings as a point to learn a lot about the organization, which can be valuable, but I think it can be just as valuable for

1183
02:00:44,153 --> 02:01:00,990
[SPEAKER_15]: the those those department heads to really think about the narratives that they're providing us instead of like rinse repeating them every year because they look exactly the same every year but instead to say we've got this opportunity put your narratives together so that they can be rolled up um

1184
02:01:02,172 --> 02:01:10,795
[SPEAKER_15]: and we start with a night where you tell us what you think the priorities are, and then we figure out from that night what has to happen next.

1185
02:01:11,455 --> 02:01:13,916
[SPEAKER_15]: Do we need a deep dive into something or not?

1186
02:01:15,657 --> 02:01:18,618
[SPEAKER_15]: So that would be my suggestion of what the process could look like.

1187
02:01:19,938 --> 02:01:23,420
[SPEAKER_15]: You are independently soliciting input from us between now and then.

1188
02:01:23,440 --> 02:01:29,282
[SPEAKER_15]: You are putting together your vision of what this budget needs to look like to meet the goals and objectives that

1189
02:01:30,412 --> 02:01:41,344
[SPEAKER_15]: you have and that we have indicated to you and then you come back and present it and then we take from there like where the you know where there is you know a discrepancy.

1190
02:01:41,364 --> 02:01:44,828
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes a lot more sense to me.

1191
02:01:46,642 --> 02:01:59,469
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, I think there could be other pieces that when we do say we're going to do a deep dive, it might not be, well, we want to do a deep dive on how we structure our technology investments.

1192
02:01:59,709 --> 02:02:07,054
[SPEAKER_01]: That could be a concrete example of something that we really want to go all in on an evening and really talk about how are we

1193
02:02:08,037 --> 02:02:14,059
[SPEAKER_01]: prioritizing instructional adaptive technology to meet 21st century learning needs, right?

1194
02:02:14,159 --> 02:02:16,180
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be a good example of that.

1195
02:02:16,260 --> 02:02:21,462
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think ultimately provide more of a sound basis on which to advocate for these investments.

1196
02:02:21,903 --> 02:02:30,046
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, I also think we could take a more sort of principled view and say, well, how does our commitment to equity manifest itself?

1197
02:02:30,926 --> 02:02:31,528
[SPEAKER_01]: in this budget.

1198
02:02:31,568 --> 02:02:39,421
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that, um, you know, obtaining that individual feedback and formulating sort of a preliminary set of recommendations.

1199
02:02:39,822 --> 02:02:44,029
[SPEAKER_01]: I think from a timeline perspective, March late March would probably be, um,

1200
02:02:45,488 --> 02:02:56,695
[SPEAKER_01]: appropriate understanding that there could be some variables in terms of state or local financial capacity that are unanswered, but that shouldn't necessarily drive what the priorities are.

1201
02:02:56,715 --> 02:03:07,461
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's been sort of one of the disconnects that manifests itself year in and year out is that there's a presumption that we should only develop priorities consistent with what our needs are.

1202
02:03:07,481 --> 02:03:13,605
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we have to develop our contingencies consistent with what our needs are, but I don't think that should necessarily

1203
02:03:14,975 --> 02:03:17,960
[SPEAKER_01]: the development of our vision and our priorities.

1204
02:03:17,980 --> 02:03:19,342
[SPEAKER_08]: I agree.

1205
02:03:28,023 --> 02:03:37,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Going back to the original reason we were looking to start the budget process earlier, looking to be able to hire or have a wider pool of candidates to hire from.

1206
02:03:38,546 --> 02:03:42,847
[SPEAKER_04]: As a teacher, I know when I would look for jobs, I would start looking probably even in early March.

1207
02:03:43,567 --> 02:03:49,348
[SPEAKER_04]: And there were lots of towns that were listing 2030 anticipated openings.

1208
02:03:49,888 --> 02:03:53,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there any reason we couldn't do that, that we at least start

1209
02:03:53,616 --> 02:03:55,777
[SPEAKER_04]: getting a pool of candidates we know are interested?

1210
02:03:56,657 --> 02:03:58,138
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I think that's exactly what we plan to do.

1211
02:03:58,158 --> 02:04:00,819
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we see March as the start of recruitment season.

1212
02:04:01,259 --> 02:04:03,100
[SPEAKER_01]: That is when other districts post, to your point.

1213
02:04:03,500 --> 02:04:08,182
[SPEAKER_01]: It is where the largest district with the largest financial capacity posts.

1214
02:04:08,222 --> 02:04:10,403
[SPEAKER_01]: They put all their postings up on March 1st.

1215
02:04:10,563 --> 02:04:14,004
[SPEAKER_01]: And so March is when we have to do that.

1216
02:04:14,425 --> 02:04:22,688
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's a matter of using the strategy of opening continuous postings to some degree, and then identifying the positions that we know are certainly

1217
02:04:23,830 --> 02:04:24,571
[SPEAKER_01]: we're going to need.

1218
02:04:25,552 --> 02:04:29,615
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be hiring, as there is in every district, that will continue into the summer.

1219
02:04:29,796 --> 02:04:31,437
[SPEAKER_01]: That's inevitable.

1220
02:04:32,038 --> 02:04:42,026
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's no reason that we can't start that process of recruitment and screening and the cultivation of diverse applicant pools in March, and that is what we plan to do.

1221
02:04:42,426 --> 02:04:44,168
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I'm unaware, has that been done before?

1222
02:04:44,188 --> 02:04:45,589
[SPEAKER_04]: Have I just not been aware of it?

1223
02:04:45,609 --> 02:04:47,871
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't done last year, I know that.

1224
02:04:47,891 --> 02:04:48,752
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it wasn't, okay.

1225
02:04:49,902 --> 02:04:51,763
[SPEAKER_01]: but it hasn't been done historically.

1226
02:04:51,783 --> 02:04:59,469
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not uncommon for smaller districts, particularly districts that, you know, there are open questions from a budgetary perspective.

1227
02:04:59,529 --> 02:05:13,018
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it is conceivable that under this process, we could, you know, have a shortfall and then, but given the sort of scale of our operation, there's really no reason that we can't be recruiting candidates earlier.

1228
02:05:15,520 --> 02:05:16,180
[SPEAKER_08]: Member McLaughlin.

1229
02:05:18,042 --> 02:05:18,382
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1230
02:05:19,537 --> 02:05:26,404
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I definitely hear what folks are saying about the six meetings at several hours each.

1231
02:05:26,864 --> 02:05:37,616
[SPEAKER_17]: One of the things that I did find interesting in those meetings was it is an edification process for community and I'm wondering how we can address transparency in the budget for the community.

1232
02:05:38,241 --> 02:05:56,006
[SPEAKER_17]: around this and then also just a process question because I don't remember, I don't have the minutes and maybe Susie can refer, but did we vote in, didn't we vote in January, early January that we would have a process or a schedule outlined and pass that motion?

1233
02:05:56,106 --> 02:06:02,708
[SPEAKER_17]: And I don't know if that means we have to have a motion to bypass that motion or what for the process question.

1234
02:06:03,908 --> 02:06:11,591
[SPEAKER_17]: Two things, how can we address transparency in the budget for the community, specifically if we are individually sending you what we're saying our priorities are?

1235
02:06:11,611 --> 02:06:16,993
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm wondering how community members know what we're saying our priorities are, among other things.

1236
02:06:17,053 --> 02:06:24,936
[SPEAKER_17]: But also sort of just the whole process for me when I would go to budget meetings before I was on the school committee, and I actually learned a lot when I would go to the budget meetings for the COW.

1237
02:06:24,976 --> 02:06:26,477
[SPEAKER_17]: I know if you're probably going to them,

1238
02:06:27,017 --> 02:06:33,380
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, multiple times over several years, they get very repetitive, but not everybody in our community is doing that.

1239
02:06:33,540 --> 02:06:35,101
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a lot of new people in our community.

1240
02:06:35,221 --> 02:06:39,043
[SPEAKER_17]: And so I just, how do we address the transparency and then the process question?

1241
02:06:39,403 --> 02:06:43,685
[SPEAKER_01]: I think on the transparency, I think, I think the point has been made both by you, Ms.

1242
02:06:43,705 --> 02:06:44,305
[SPEAKER_01]: McLaughlin and Ms.

1243
02:06:44,345 --> 02:06:49,548
[SPEAKER_01]: Graham, that the budget is an opportunity for an examination of the organizational structure.

1244
02:06:50,188 --> 02:06:55,491
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one of the conversations that I think we should have is on

1245
02:06:56,797 --> 02:07:06,689
[SPEAKER_01]: articulating the organizational structure and making clear to folks how it is that the budget is built and how the budget reflects an organizational structure.

1246
02:07:06,729 --> 02:07:11,735
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if there's a specific issue that someone wants to learn more about,

1247
02:07:12,983 --> 02:07:20,870
[SPEAKER_01]: this, the process that we're discussing this evening wouldn't necessarily advance that goal as much as the sort of the broken down piece would.

1248
02:07:22,271 --> 02:07:31,939
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think if we understand that we have to devote part of the time, not just diving into where the money comes from how much it is where it's going, but also how

1249
02:07:33,100 --> 02:07:36,862
[SPEAKER_01]: The budget is reflective of how we are organized as a school district.

1250
02:07:37,763 --> 02:07:40,544
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that would advance that goal with regard to transparency.

1251
02:07:40,964 --> 02:07:44,566
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I think with respect to your individual priorities, these would be public records.

1252
02:07:44,606 --> 02:07:51,449
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, as I'm sure all of you know, whenever you email one of us, if you're doing so in your capacity as a school committee member,

1253
02:07:52,903 --> 02:07:54,565
[SPEAKER_01]: it would be a public record.

1254
02:07:54,605 --> 02:08:08,337
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think what we would want to do is before we are presenting a synthesized version of the priorities or recommendations, I would imagine that we would construct a document that would pretty much record all of the priorities that you

1255
02:08:09,356 --> 02:08:10,077
[SPEAKER_01]: advocated for.

1256
02:08:10,097 --> 02:08:14,881
[SPEAKER_01]: There's obviously we'd have a series of public meetings which you'd have the opportunity to do that publicly on the record as well.

1257
02:08:15,621 --> 02:08:23,147
[SPEAKER_01]: But I certainly think to the point of transparency, they should be memorialized as the things that you that you that you advocated for.

1258
02:08:24,388 --> 02:08:28,452
[SPEAKER_01]: With regard to process, I mean, I don't have the exact language of the vote, but the the

1259
02:08:29,553 --> 02:08:34,401
[SPEAKER_01]: my certainly our interpretation of it was you wanted just the exact conversation that we're having right now.

1260
02:08:34,482 --> 02:08:40,111
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't think I think you have both you and we have fulfilled the intent of that motion.

1261
02:08:40,311 --> 02:08:42,836
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm, I believe I'm hearing

1262
02:08:43,300 --> 02:08:55,531
[SPEAKER_01]: the beginnings of a consensus that you'd like to provide sets of priorities that you expect to see reflected in our budgetary priorities.

1263
02:08:55,992 --> 02:09:04,480
[SPEAKER_01]: We would then present that back to you, make sure that that's made public, that that's memorialized, and then begin a conversation that would start with a preliminary set of recommendations.

1264
02:09:05,020 --> 02:09:05,941
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from that point,

1265
02:09:07,189 --> 02:09:14,911
[SPEAKER_01]: The committee, I would ask that you would give us direction as to what are some specific topics that you would like us to dive deeper on.

1266
02:09:14,991 --> 02:09:22,013
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've just in the last 10 minutes have identified two or three that I think would be perfectly appropriate forums.

1267
02:09:23,693 --> 02:09:33,095
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think as we see the concrete recommendations being developed, we'll probably be even clearer to us what are some of the pieces that we might want to dive down.

1268
02:09:33,616 --> 02:09:35,116
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think timeline-wise,

1269
02:09:36,304 --> 02:09:48,334
[SPEAKER_01]: The important part is that we want to have a general timeline as to when you are going to vote on the superintendent's recommendation, which, as I said, becomes your request to the municipal government.

1270
02:09:50,455 --> 02:10:07,544
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding that there may be a series of unanswered questions at the time that you make that request, but also knowing that as the school administration, we are going to be preparing to execute a budget that is consistent with the city's capacity so that we're able to make good on all of our commitments to students.

1271
02:10:09,065 --> 02:10:12,727
[SPEAKER_01]: So if that's the consensus, then we will develop a form.

1272
02:10:13,635 --> 02:10:14,475
[SPEAKER_01]: It will be distributed to you.

1273
02:10:14,495 --> 02:10:16,656
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll have the opportunity to provide us that feedback.

1274
02:10:17,316 --> 02:10:34,723
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would say by mid-March, we will return with a synthesized version of those recommendations as a set of preliminary budgetary priorities that will then inform how we move forward with regard to what areas you'd like to drill down on more deeply before ultimately making your request to the municipal government.

1275
02:10:37,064 --> 02:10:38,325
[SPEAKER_12]: Member Ruseau?

1276
02:10:38,907 --> 02:10:39,247
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1277
02:10:39,307 --> 02:10:46,811
[SPEAKER_12]: I just want to thank Member McLaughlin for her point about transparency and the value of the budget meetings that we've had in the past.

1278
02:10:48,732 --> 02:11:02,958
[SPEAKER_12]: And something I had meant to mention earlier, and her comment reminded me, when the mayor did her first budget, that was an award-winning budget,

1279
02:11:04,953 --> 02:11:13,597
[SPEAKER_12]: know, I don't know for sure that the content is truly identical, but it is accessible.

1280
02:11:14,457 --> 02:11:16,898
[SPEAKER_12]: And transparency is a weird word.

1281
02:11:16,918 --> 02:11:19,699
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it's all there, so it's transparent.

1282
02:11:19,780 --> 02:11:24,021
[SPEAKER_12]: But if it's not actually consumable or accessible, then it's sort of a

1283
02:11:27,219 --> 02:11:30,640
[SPEAKER_12]: not, I wouldn't really call it the most accessible document.

1284
02:11:31,520 --> 02:11:44,143
[SPEAKER_12]: So, I mean, and obviously this isn't, in the middle of a pandemic, this is not the year, but I hope that within a couple of years, we're able to do something magical like happened with the budget that we have at the city.

1285
02:11:44,163 --> 02:11:50,364
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not sure if you've compared the before and after, but it's kind of a shocking transformation.

1286
02:11:50,584 --> 02:11:52,645
[SPEAKER_12]: And when I look at our documents,

1287
02:11:55,283 --> 02:11:56,223
[SPEAKER_12]: They're rough.

1288
02:11:57,064 --> 02:11:59,205
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, the content's there.

1289
02:11:59,225 --> 02:12:04,647
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just not a cohesive, here's our community, here's our school system.

1290
02:12:05,987 --> 02:12:19,193
[SPEAKER_12]: And when I think about transparency, I bet people would much rather look at a document similar to the city budget than sit through any number of hours of meetings if they could just go to it and find what they want and learn about it.

1291
02:12:19,853 --> 02:12:22,754
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just wanted to thank Member McLaughlin for that.

1292
02:12:23,913 --> 02:12:28,954
[SPEAKER_12]: reminding me about that word transparency, because I think it's really important, but not important for this year, obviously.

1293
02:12:30,915 --> 02:12:32,215
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, it is important.

1294
02:12:32,235 --> 02:12:33,955
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be transparent, just to be clear.

1295
02:12:33,975 --> 02:12:35,016
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be very transparent.

1296
02:12:35,036 --> 02:12:47,998
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, to your point about accessibility, I think if we're able to package the information that is a little more digestible, I suspect that it will make it more accessible and therefore more transparent.

1297
02:12:49,519 --> 02:12:50,039
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be our goal.

1298
02:12:54,200 --> 02:12:54,840
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Graham.

1299
02:12:54,860 --> 02:13:19,331
[SPEAKER_15]: I would, on the topic of transparency, I would implore the administration to stop rinse repeating the narratives that come to us in the budget and really think thoughtfully about like the questions that we ask again and again, every single year, like, why are there two gym teachers at the Missittuck and not at any other elementary school?

1300
02:13:20,103 --> 02:13:30,338
[SPEAKER_15]: If there's a rational answer for that, that we can articulate and define, I think it would serve us all because we forget what that answer is when it gets verbally delivered to us.

1301
02:13:30,358 --> 02:13:31,840
[SPEAKER_15]: Or why do we dole out?

1302
02:13:36,302 --> 02:13:43,684
[SPEAKER_15]: office supply budgets as though there's the same number of kids in every school when there's a hundred less kids in one elementary school than others.

1303
02:13:44,244 --> 02:13:51,547
[SPEAKER_15]: So there are questions that we ask that draw out those conversations that we ask every year, honestly.

1304
02:13:52,347 --> 02:14:04,831
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's a missed opportunity for the documentation to tell a story, not just to us, but more importantly to the community who may or may not want to sit through many, many hours of meetings that

1305
02:14:06,581 --> 02:14:17,685
[SPEAKER_15]: We are interested in telling a story about how we spend our money because I think it's critically important and it lends itself to the confidence that the community has that we're spending money thoughtfully.

1306
02:14:17,705 --> 02:14:33,970
[SPEAKER_15]: So there is an opportunity there and maybe it doesn't look as pretty as the municipal budget does this year, but the quality of the information can improve with the collective force of the organization deciding that's important.

1307
02:14:38,583 --> 02:14:40,164
[SPEAKER_08]: Good point, thank you, Member Graham.

1308
02:14:41,905 --> 02:14:43,486
[SPEAKER_08]: So is there a motion on the floor?

1309
02:14:43,546 --> 02:14:44,847
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we all?

1310
02:14:44,967 --> 02:14:49,770
[SPEAKER_01]: I just really need to know if what I've summarized is in keeping with the committee's expectations.

1311
02:14:51,571 --> 02:15:00,417
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems that is the consensus, but I know there was a motion put on the floor, so I just wanna... Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

1312
02:15:01,658 --> 02:15:03,079
[SPEAKER_06]: But please stay, you're up next.

1313
02:15:03,679 --> 02:15:05,361
[SPEAKER_06]: Number seven, summer school fees.

1314
02:15:05,441 --> 02:15:07,402
[SPEAKER_06]: Assistant Superintendent of Finance and Operations

1315
02:15:07,932 --> 02:15:14,435
[SPEAKER_06]: David Murphy will respond to committee inquiry regarding summer school fee waivers.

1316
02:15:15,215 --> 02:15:21,899
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a resolution that you are, you'll be considering later this evening regarding the waiver of summer school fees.

1317
02:15:22,299 --> 02:15:28,182
[SPEAKER_01]: So we just put up on the screen, it's a very quick slide, just to answer your, the questions that were posed that evening.

1318
02:15:29,282 --> 02:15:44,070
[SPEAKER_01]: The answer to the question is there are a lot of variables that, if the question is just what financial liability would we create by saying that we will no longer charge a fee to any student designated as either EL economically disadvantaged or a student with disabilities, it's impossible to say because of the variables.

1319
02:15:44,170 --> 02:15:45,031
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know how many students

1320
02:15:46,071 --> 02:15:48,152
[SPEAKER_01]: there would be qualifying in those subgroups.

1321
02:15:48,172 --> 02:15:53,416
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know how many total students there would be, and therefore, we don't know what the staffing needs of any specific summer would be.

1322
02:15:54,596 --> 02:16:03,682
[SPEAKER_01]: I can tell you that if we looked at the numbers from last year, based on the number of students that, we collected $9,500 in fees last year.

1323
02:16:03,722 --> 02:16:12,508
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a charge of $250 per course, a maximum number of courses per student of two courses, and it was a 250 charge per course.

1324
02:16:13,088 --> 02:16:20,071
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at the EL subgroup, fees were either reduced or waived for 15 of the 17 students.

1325
02:16:21,052 --> 02:16:30,656
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was similar percentages with regard to students with disabilities and the economically disadvantaged student cohort.

1326
02:16:33,764 --> 02:16:44,778
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, the maximum liability that you would be creating if you were to say anyone qualifying under these three groups under no circumstances will be charged for a summer class based on the numbers from last year would be $47,000.

1327
02:16:44,818 --> 02:16:45,299
[SPEAKER_01]: It would never be $47,000.

1328
02:16:45,339 --> 02:16:47,241
[SPEAKER_01]: As I said, we only collected a total of $9,500 last year.

1329
02:16:52,328 --> 02:16:55,210
[SPEAKER_01]: the total operating budget, I believe was $17,000.

1330
02:16:55,671 --> 02:16:58,373
[SPEAKER_01]: But that would be if every single student qualifying in those subgroups.

1331
02:16:58,414 --> 02:17:00,656
[SPEAKER_01]: And I actually don't think that counts overlap.

1332
02:17:00,676 --> 02:17:03,138
[SPEAKER_01]: So it would be less than that, probably be about $30,000.

1333
02:17:04,019 --> 02:17:08,363
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's if everybody took two classes, which is also not the case.

1334
02:17:08,423 --> 02:17:12,828
[SPEAKER_01]: So the short version of this is that it is a financial liability.

1335
02:17:12,948 --> 02:17:15,250
[SPEAKER_01]: Summer school is a financial liability to begin with.

1336
02:17:15,310 --> 02:17:17,112
[SPEAKER_01]: We historically do not appear to have

1337
02:17:18,012 --> 02:17:23,054
[SPEAKER_01]: generated revenue to offset the total cost of staffing the summer school.

1338
02:17:23,634 --> 02:17:36,638
[SPEAKER_01]: I imagine it goes without saying that there are a host of other considerations from a programming perspective as to how we do summer school, and that no student is ever charged for a program that is part of their IEP.

1339
02:17:36,778 --> 02:17:43,360
[SPEAKER_01]: So a student could be a student with disabilities who has an IEP and happens to be going to the credit recovery summer program,

1340
02:17:43,800 --> 02:17:50,845
[SPEAKER_01]: that's different than the extended school year program that is part of a child's IEP of which we of course would not charge.

1341
02:17:50,905 --> 02:17:56,469
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's no recommendation against doing this from the administration's part.

1342
02:17:56,930 --> 02:18:04,335
[SPEAKER_01]: Understanding that the budget will include a line if you do this that does create that liability.

1343
02:18:04,856 --> 02:18:06,757
[SPEAKER_01]: I am not concerned at the moment

1344
02:18:07,305 --> 02:18:10,667
[SPEAKER_01]: about absorbing this liability in the operating budget.

1345
02:18:10,907 --> 02:18:13,308
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't speak to what it will be like three or four years from now.

1346
02:18:13,748 --> 02:18:19,311
[SPEAKER_01]: And obviously, whenever you create that expectation, there's an issue as to how you're going to address it going forward.

1347
02:18:20,491 --> 02:18:26,574
[SPEAKER_01]: The only strong recommendation that's in the second column there is that the 45-day timeline will not work.

1348
02:18:26,754 --> 02:18:28,215
[SPEAKER_01]: It will not be enforceable.

1349
02:18:30,931 --> 02:18:45,059
[SPEAKER_01]: we have to recommend excising that line because you just don't have determinations made yet as to eligibility for the need for summer school, and it could be very disruptive to the process of getting students to the finish line of the school year.

1350
02:18:45,119 --> 02:18:56,185
[SPEAKER_01]: But short of excising that line and understanding that there will be a budgetary implication, although not a hugely significant one, that's essentially the information that I have for you.

1351
02:18:58,707 --> 02:19:03,009
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I said, you're gonna take out the resolution later in the evening, but if you have any questions, I'm happy to answer them now or later.

1352
02:19:04,170 --> 02:19:04,851
[SPEAKER_06]: Member McLaughlin?

1353
02:19:06,431 --> 02:19:06,772
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1354
02:19:07,732 --> 02:19:09,113
[SPEAKER_17]: Did we get a copy of that in our pocket?

1355
02:19:09,153 --> 02:19:09,673
[SPEAKER_17]: I didn't see it.

1356
02:19:10,134 --> 02:19:10,894
[SPEAKER_17]: If not, can we get it?

1357
02:19:11,074 --> 02:19:13,635
[SPEAKER_01]: You didn't have a copy of it.

1358
02:19:13,696 --> 02:19:14,896
[SPEAKER_17]: And the deck that you did earlier?

1359
02:19:15,176 --> 02:19:17,177
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't see it in the pocket.

1360
02:19:18,018 --> 02:19:18,958
[SPEAKER_01]: You didn't have them in your pocket.

1361
02:19:20,079 --> 02:19:22,320
[SPEAKER_17]: If we can get those to that, it'd be really helpful.

1362
02:19:22,360 --> 02:19:23,441
[SPEAKER_01]: They were distributed this afternoon.

1363
02:19:23,941 --> 02:19:24,201
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry?

1364
02:19:24,442 --> 02:19:25,602
[SPEAKER_01]: They were distributed this afternoon.

1365
02:19:25,902 --> 02:19:26,823
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, thank you.

1366
02:19:28,217 --> 02:19:34,640
[SPEAKER_17]: So, and how many of the, I'm sorry, can you put that graphic back up again, please, Peter?

1367
02:19:42,223 --> 02:19:53,467
[SPEAKER_17]: How many of the, I know it was 17 EL, 32 students with disability, and then it was 60 something ED you had, which I'm assuming is just- Economically disadvantaged.

1368
02:19:53,527 --> 02:19:54,888
[SPEAKER_17]: It is the economically disadvantaged.

1369
02:19:55,316 --> 02:19:58,577
[SPEAKER_17]: So out of all of, so that's the total, is that the total student data?

1370
02:19:59,238 --> 02:20:03,859
[SPEAKER_17]: Is that the total that's attending summer school or are there any that fall outside of the high needs?

1371
02:20:03,879 --> 02:20:11,062
[SPEAKER_01]: There are students that don't qualify in any of those three subgroups and there are also students who qualify in multiple subgroups would be counted individually in those numbers.

1372
02:20:11,602 --> 02:20:13,503
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you know how many students don't?

1373
02:20:14,223 --> 02:20:15,984
[SPEAKER_17]: So of those, what was it?

1374
02:20:16,084 --> 02:20:16,284
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

1375
02:20:16,864 --> 02:20:18,485
[SPEAKER_17]: So 96 students.

1376
02:20:18,545 --> 02:20:21,206
[SPEAKER_17]: Yep.

1377
02:20:21,226 --> 02:20:22,146
[SPEAKER_17]: 21 and none of those.

1378
02:20:22,386 --> 02:20:22,666
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1379
02:20:23,027 --> 02:20:23,207
[SPEAKER_01]: Well,

1380
02:20:24,823 --> 02:20:28,466
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's not the total number of students.

1381
02:20:32,249 --> 02:20:38,934
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe the total number of students that were in the credit recovery program was 130, but I can try to confirm that for you.

1382
02:20:40,616 --> 02:20:41,396
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, that's what I want to know.

1383
02:20:41,456 --> 02:20:48,542
[SPEAKER_17]: What are the total number of students that are attending and what are the most vulnerable subgroups so that we can get some idea of where revenue is

1384
02:20:49,106 --> 02:20:50,466
[SPEAKER_17]: is or is not generated.

1385
02:20:50,666 --> 02:20:52,007
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, those are the subgroups.

1386
02:20:52,187 --> 02:21:00,589
[SPEAKER_01]: So that I said the maximum, if every single, if every, if, if no, if there was no overlap between the subgroups, which is not true.

1387
02:21:01,389 --> 02:21:06,150
[SPEAKER_01]: And if every student took two courses at two, which is also not true.

1388
02:21:06,670 --> 02:21:12,111
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we continue to charge two 50, um, which is true as of now, but that's, that's really up to you.

1389
02:21:12,792 --> 02:21:14,212
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that, that,

1390
02:21:15,219 --> 02:21:16,562
[SPEAKER_01]: financial liability would be $47,000.

1391
02:21:16,842 --> 02:21:22,553
[SPEAKER_01]: That's significantly in excess of the actual operating cost of the program.

1392
02:21:22,594 --> 02:21:26,241
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a very high number.

1393
02:21:26,917 --> 02:21:27,697
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, thank you.

1394
02:21:27,737 --> 02:21:37,922
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think you'd have, I would be very surprised if this were to create anything more than a $20,000 liability, I would be extremely surprised.

1395
02:21:38,062 --> 02:21:46,446
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, so I thank you, and I would love the number of just the total, when you get a chance, it doesn't have to be tonight, but when you get a chance, it would be really helpful.

1396
02:21:46,846 --> 02:21:49,807
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, the total number of students enrolled.

1397
02:21:49,887 --> 02:21:50,908
[SPEAKER_17]: Total number of students enrolled.

1398
02:21:51,008 --> 02:21:51,408
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was 130.

1399
02:21:51,448 --> 02:21:51,408
130?

1400
02:21:51,468 --> 02:21:55,190
[SPEAKER_17]: Is that what you said?

1401
02:21:55,230 --> 02:21:55,930
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.

1402
02:21:56,590 --> 02:21:57,110
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it was 130.

1403
02:21:57,150 --> 02:21:57,491
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, thanks.

1404
02:21:57,551 --> 02:22:01,312
[SPEAKER_17]: It was 96 students with a total of 160 enrollments.

1405
02:22:02,213 --> 02:22:02,853
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1406
02:22:02,873 --> 02:22:02,953
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1407
02:22:13,366 --> 02:22:15,568
[SPEAKER_17]: And then I am willing to make an amendment.

1408
02:22:15,648 --> 02:22:21,893
[SPEAKER_17]: I just want to clarify for the 45 day, it was really, it's not about necessarily the period of time more.

1409
02:22:22,193 --> 02:22:39,026
[SPEAKER_17]: It was more about hearing from constituents who were not, or were saying that they were not really getting notification or understanding that their child was going to be requiring summer school, particularly for retention, not as much for, you know, remediation perhaps, but specifically for retention.

1410
02:22:39,634 --> 02:22:51,484
[SPEAKER_17]: So I want to know, or I would amend it to whatever the superintendent thinks is reasonable for students and families to be notified of the need for summer school due to retention.

1411
02:22:52,962 --> 02:22:54,762
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I think we can report back on that.

1412
02:22:54,782 --> 02:23:03,725
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, a lot of these cases are being handled on an individual case-by-case basis, trying to devise strategies that will best support an individual student.

1413
02:23:03,745 --> 02:23:05,905
[SPEAKER_01]: So in some cases, that could be summer school.

1414
02:23:05,945 --> 02:23:11,166
[SPEAKER_01]: In some cases, that could be additional project-oriented work at the end of the school year.

1415
02:23:17,548 --> 02:23:21,669
[SPEAKER_01]: Sort of one-size-fits-all timeline, but I think I hear your point that

1416
02:23:22,547 --> 02:23:44,149
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, correct me if I'm wrong, is that if there's inadequate communication about the potential implications for a student's performance in a course, being either retention or a need for summer school, that has to be an ongoing dialogue and make sure that both the student, and I think probably just as important the parent, guardian, caregiver, are fully informed of those implications.

1417
02:23:44,229 --> 02:23:45,871
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that a fair characterization there?

1418
02:23:48,208 --> 02:23:52,811
[SPEAKER_17]: processes created, you know, or outlined on what that is.

1419
02:23:52,851 --> 02:23:57,575
[SPEAKER_01]: What efforts are made and if necessary, what improvements.

1420
02:23:57,755 --> 02:23:58,836
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1421
02:23:59,036 --> 02:24:05,480
[SPEAKER_13]: I can definitely get that information because there are specific dates at the high school where families are notified.

1422
02:24:05,500 --> 02:24:13,706
[SPEAKER_13]: I just don't have them, you know, at the tip of my fingers right now, but I do know there are points where they're notified.

1423
02:24:13,866 --> 02:24:16,568
[SPEAKER_13]: And then, as I was saying at the last meeting that

1424
02:24:17,819 --> 02:24:22,663
[SPEAKER_13]: some students might be on the cusp and think that they're okay.

1425
02:24:22,803 --> 02:24:32,271
[SPEAKER_13]: And then, you know, I don't know that like at the end, instead of their scores improving their scores go in the opposite direction.

1426
02:24:32,331 --> 02:24:38,617
[SPEAKER_13]: So sometimes it is like a late notification, but I can definitely work on getting that for you.

1427
02:24:41,879 --> 02:24:42,460
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Mustone.

1428
02:24:43,882 --> 02:25:00,493
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure if it's for Mr. Cushing or Dr. Maurice, but have the engagement specialist have a better handle on absenteeism, which I know some kids, because of retention or absence, end up going to summer school.

1429
02:25:01,093 --> 02:25:07,057
[SPEAKER_03]: So do you know if that is the attendance better with engagement specialists this year in place?

1430
02:25:07,987 --> 02:25:12,472
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there are a lot of variables this year in addition to the engagement specialists.

1431
02:25:12,612 --> 02:25:17,978
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't think this particular month is the ideal month to be gauging our attendance.

1432
02:25:18,218 --> 02:25:25,767
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would say that we have recently reorganized their deployment to put additional engagement specialist support at the high school.

1433
02:25:27,068 --> 02:25:42,333
[SPEAKER_01]: in response to a variety, for a variety of reasons, but one of which is in response to some of the climate issues that we've talked about in this forum to try to bolster that school's connectivity with, and I think attendance is one of

1434
02:25:42,773 --> 02:25:43,253
[SPEAKER_01]: the factors.

1435
02:25:43,293 --> 02:25:55,861
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, they have just in the last few weeks, the team has devised a series of attendance protocols that they've asked for the opportunity to present to principals at the conclusion of this school year for implementation next year.

1436
02:25:55,881 --> 02:26:01,284
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it would be information that the committee will find useful when that time arrives.

1437
02:26:05,007 --> 02:26:05,367
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1438
02:26:06,167 --> 02:26:07,168
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for the presentation.

1439
02:26:11,260 --> 02:26:12,680
[SPEAKER_17]: So the motion's on the floor.

1440
02:26:13,561 --> 02:26:14,381
[SPEAKER_17]: Just needs a second.

1441
02:26:15,921 --> 02:26:19,382
[SPEAKER_17]: The motion is that we, hold on.

1442
02:26:21,383 --> 02:26:23,403
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's later in the agenda, you have the rest of it.

1443
02:26:23,463 --> 02:26:24,524
[SPEAKER_08]: It is on the agenda.

1444
02:26:25,044 --> 02:26:30,245
[SPEAKER_08]: It's in continued business.

1445
02:26:34,687 --> 02:26:36,727
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, it's on page three of the agenda.

1446
02:26:37,387 --> 02:26:38,408
[SPEAKER_06]: Which page is it on the agenda?

1447
02:26:40,407 --> 02:26:42,828
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry, I just, I'm sorry, I can't hear you.

1448
02:26:43,769 --> 02:26:45,310
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, it's on page three of the agenda.

1449
02:26:46,430 --> 02:26:54,735
[SPEAKER_17]: So, and I'm making an amendment to remove the 45 days before the last day of school for the credit remediation to prevent retention.

1450
02:26:54,795 --> 02:27:04,761
[SPEAKER_17]: But I would add that a policy will be created to define outreach for retention.

1451
02:27:05,861 --> 02:27:08,903
[SPEAKER_17]: That's, you know, communicated to the community.

1452
02:27:10,565 --> 02:27:13,367
[SPEAKER_17]: into the school committee so that we know what that is ahead of time.

1453
02:27:13,427 --> 02:27:20,951
[SPEAKER_17]: So that, cause what part of the problem was that we were hearing, I was hearing from constituents that they were not getting this communication.

1454
02:27:21,471 --> 02:27:33,957
[SPEAKER_17]: And I know that each side may beg to differ, but it's still, you know, if, if people are saying they don't feel communicated with and others are saying they're communicating, there's clearly, you know, something that needs to be fixed.

1455
02:27:34,317 --> 02:27:35,458
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think it could be around,

1456
02:27:36,020 --> 02:27:49,249
[SPEAKER_17]: just a policy or something that is posted and lets folks know and lets us know what the process is to let families know a student may be retained and require summer school.

1457
02:27:49,709 --> 02:27:54,773
[SPEAKER_06]: So is there a motion to merge this with number seven or do you want to wait until we get there?

1458
02:27:55,113 --> 02:27:57,474
[SPEAKER_05]: Number seven?

1459
02:27:59,015 --> 02:28:01,297
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not on continued business yet.

1460
02:28:01,437 --> 02:28:03,138
[SPEAKER_06]: We are on number seven reports.

1461
02:28:03,719 --> 02:28:05,740
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just want to, yeah.

1462
02:28:08,508 --> 02:28:18,430
[SPEAKER_06]: No further questions on number seven, we'll go right to number eight, which is MSBA application, assistant superintendent of finance and operations, David Murphy.

1463
02:28:18,450 --> 02:28:23,472
[SPEAKER_06]: We will report on Medford High School and MSBA application deadline update.

1464
02:28:24,212 --> 02:28:28,473
[SPEAKER_06]: The central administration will present on the recently announced application windows.

1465
02:28:29,069 --> 02:28:43,889
[SPEAKER_06]: for the Massachusetts School Building Authority Repair Project windows opening January 28, 2022, and the administration's plans to consider possible statements of interest through either or both of the core program or accelerated repair program.

1466
02:28:44,229 --> 02:28:44,670
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Murphy.

1467
02:28:45,053 --> 02:28:45,493
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mayor.

1468
02:28:46,194 --> 02:28:56,539
[SPEAKER_01]: The superintendent provided a memo to the committee outlining essentially the options and how it relates to your consideration of a resolution that's in the agenda later this evening.

1469
02:28:57,660 --> 02:29:01,201
[SPEAKER_01]: These are programs that open annually through the Massachusetts School Building Authority.

1470
02:29:01,742 --> 02:29:07,505
[SPEAKER_01]: It is my understanding that at least three years ago, there was an application that was submitted on behalf of Medford for a core program.

1471
02:29:09,085 --> 02:29:22,128
[SPEAKER_01]: It's unclear, just based on my review of the documents, sort of what steps preceded that, either in consultation with MSBA officials or some of the experts in the field of school construction and MSBA advocacy.

1472
02:29:23,708 --> 02:29:30,410
[SPEAKER_01]: The memo, and if you've seen the MSBA's announcement, sort of spell out the distinction between the two programs.

1473
02:29:31,310 --> 02:29:37,351
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the superintendent mentioned it in her remarks earlier this evening, that the core program is essentially a new building,

1474
02:29:37,772 --> 02:29:39,696
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes that can mean the shell of the old building.

1475
02:29:39,716 --> 02:29:44,486
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very extensive renovation and sometimes it's new construction.

1476
02:29:45,553 --> 02:29:54,117
[SPEAKER_01]: That plays out over a very, very long process of a variety of considerations that with ample community and local stakeholder feedback.

1477
02:29:54,537 --> 02:30:05,622
[SPEAKER_01]: The accelerated repair program is focused on the sort of three core, very expensive pieces of a school's infrastructure, the boilers, the windows and the roof.

1478
02:30:05,982 --> 02:30:10,504
[SPEAKER_01]: They have specific timelines that are attached to them, typically 25 or 30 years.

1479
02:30:13,235 --> 02:30:17,077
[SPEAKER_01]: I can tell you that our windows at Medford High School would qualify.

1480
02:30:17,917 --> 02:30:21,219
[SPEAKER_01]: They are well in well access of the year threshold.

1481
02:30:22,419 --> 02:30:37,906
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a boiler that would potentially qualify for accelerated repair, and we're looking to get some of this specificity in this, but it does not appear in this application season that the roof would qualify under the MSBA's current criteria.

1482
02:30:39,562 --> 02:30:59,770
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically in the resolution that you'll consider this evening, it would direct the administration to present to you a recommendation as to which of those two programs to apply for in the month of March, that deadline either being the end of March, the end of April, depending on the program.

1483
02:31:00,290 --> 02:31:04,552
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we would move forward.

1484
02:31:04,572 --> 02:31:06,333
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in conjunction with that,

1485
02:31:06,930 --> 02:31:20,175
[SPEAKER_01]: the convening of a flagship committee to flesh out those options and the considerations that ultimately will help inform our work with that process going forward.

1486
02:31:20,455 --> 02:31:24,797
[SPEAKER_01]: And as it says in the memo, this is a lengthy process one way or another.

1487
02:31:24,877 --> 02:31:34,801
[SPEAKER_01]: And so your vote this evening and your vote in March will not be determinative of the scope of any project that we undertake with Medford High School.

1488
02:31:36,479 --> 02:31:39,882
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are obviously a lot of questions that will have to be answered.

1489
02:31:40,823 --> 02:31:51,372
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is just committing us to a process to make sure that we're making progress on this issue, which we know has been one that has been discussed within the community and within the organization for some time.

1490
02:31:52,112 --> 02:31:54,514
[SPEAKER_01]: So if there are questions, I'm happy to try to answer them.

1491
02:31:56,952 --> 02:31:58,293
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

1492
02:31:58,493 --> 02:32:00,234
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a resolution on this as well.

1493
02:32:01,915 --> 02:32:03,556
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, Dr. Edward-Vincent.

1494
02:32:03,576 --> 02:32:08,019
[SPEAKER_13]: I wanna say thank you, Mr. Murphy, and happy 25th birthday, Mr. Murphy.

1495
02:32:08,039 --> 02:32:09,860
[SPEAKER_06]: It's his birthday?

1496
02:32:10,981 --> 02:32:12,022
[SPEAKER_06]: Happy birthday.

1497
02:32:12,042 --> 02:32:15,624
[SPEAKER_08]: He's ignoring us.

1498
02:32:18,366 --> 02:32:19,066
[SPEAKER_06]: Should we sing?

1499
02:32:19,606 --> 02:32:20,107
[SPEAKER_06]: Should we sing?

1500
02:32:20,327 --> 02:32:20,487
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1501
02:32:21,808 --> 02:32:21,968
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1502
02:32:23,823 --> 02:32:25,824
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, so you can go home, yep, okay.

1503
02:32:26,044 --> 02:32:27,505
[SPEAKER_06]: Number six, presentations of the public.

1504
02:32:28,606 --> 02:32:35,769
[SPEAKER_06]: Regular meetings of the school committee, including this presentation of the public agenda item, to give any resident the opportunity to place a presentation before the school committee.

1505
02:32:36,470 --> 02:32:38,431
[SPEAKER_06]: A resident may only present once at any meeting.

1506
02:32:39,151 --> 02:32:45,574
[SPEAKER_06]: These presentations are an opportunity for the public to make a presentation to the committee, but not opportunities for dialogue with the committee.

1507
02:32:46,075 --> 02:32:51,938
[SPEAKER_06]: If one or more members of the committee wishes to have a conversation about the topic presented, a member may request the item be added

1508
02:32:52,591 --> 02:32:53,811
[SPEAKER_06]: subsequent regular meeting.

1509
02:32:54,331 --> 02:33:01,693
[SPEAKER_06]: The details for submitting a presentation can be found within the policy BEDH public comment and presentations of the public.

1510
02:33:02,734 --> 02:33:12,576
[SPEAKER_06]: Pursuant to policy BEDH public comment and presentations of the public, any resident in the audience may be given permission to speak once on any item on the agenda for up to three minutes.

1511
02:33:12,796 --> 02:33:15,757
[SPEAKER_06]: The speaker is expected to keep their comments to the item on the agenda.

1512
02:33:16,383 --> 02:33:21,284
[SPEAKER_06]: The speaker must begin their comments by providing their full name and full Medford Street address where they reside.

1513
02:33:22,064 --> 02:33:34,306
[SPEAKER_06]: Residents may also submit their comments by writing to the superintendent of schools prior to the meeting or by emailing medfordsc at medford.k12.ma.us prior to or during the item on the agenda.

1514
02:33:34,967 --> 02:33:42,648
[SPEAKER_06]: Written comments must be kept to a length that allows for them to be read into the record in less than three minutes, or the comments will be summarized by the secretary of the school committee.

1515
02:33:43,662 --> 02:33:48,507
[SPEAKER_06]: A welcoming, inclusive community is both the value of the school committee and an aspirational goal.

1516
02:33:49,368 --> 02:33:52,891
[SPEAKER_06]: We ask for your help in achieving this goal and value your perspective.

1517
02:33:53,432 --> 02:33:56,395
[SPEAKER_06]: When writing or emailing, please provide this required information.

1518
02:33:57,016 --> 02:34:04,043
[SPEAKER_06]: The name and number of the item on the agenda, your first and last name, your full Medford Street address where you reside, your question or comment.

1519
02:34:04,924 --> 02:34:06,185
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't believe there's any emails.

1520
02:34:06,706 --> 02:34:06,946
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

1521
02:34:08,556 --> 02:34:10,176
[SPEAKER_06]: Number seven, continued business.

1522
02:34:10,436 --> 02:34:17,838
[SPEAKER_06]: Whereas students, this is offered by member McLaughlin and member Mustone, which was tabled from January 10th, 2022.

1523
02:34:18,618 --> 02:34:25,460
[SPEAKER_06]: Whereas students and families have been charged more than $200 per class for summer remediation and credit recovery.

1524
02:34:25,480 --> 02:34:37,503
[SPEAKER_06]: And whereas students enrolled in summer remediation and credit recovery are disproportionately more vulnerable subgroups, including economically disadvantaged students, students with disabilities and English learners,

1525
02:34:38,314 --> 02:34:56,124
[SPEAKER_06]: Be it resolved, Medford Public Schools will no longer charge students identified as belonging in the subgroups economically disadvantaged English learners and students with disabilities for remediation programming and credit recovery during summer programming in the academic year commencing June 1st, 2022.

1526
02:34:58,266 --> 02:35:05,430
[SPEAKER_06]: Be it further resolved that all students requiring credit remediation to prevent retention be notified in writing through the United States Postal System

1527
02:35:06,403 --> 02:35:11,767
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe you want to change this part, Member McLaughlin, and a policy will be created.

1528
02:35:12,968 --> 02:35:13,208
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1529
02:35:16,831 --> 02:35:21,114
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a motion on the floor for Member Ruseau?

1530
02:35:21,554 --> 02:35:25,537
[SPEAKER_12]: Can you repeat that new be it resolved, since I didn't quite follow?

1531
02:35:27,338 --> 02:35:35,084
[SPEAKER_06]: It states be it resolved that all students requiring credit remediation to prevent retention be notified in writing through the United States Postal System

1532
02:35:36,877 --> 02:35:44,161
[SPEAKER_06]: and 45 days before the last day of school, and I'll have Member McLaughlin clarify.

1533
02:35:44,561 --> 02:35:59,849
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry, it was be it resolved, Metro Public Schools will no longer charge students identified as belonging to the subgroups economically disadvantaged English learners and students with disabilities for mediation program and credit recovery during summer programming in the academic year commencing June 1, 2022.

1534
02:36:00,690 --> 02:36:04,332
[SPEAKER_17]: Be it further resolved, and this is where I'm saying that I would,

1535
02:36:05,513 --> 02:36:29,632
[SPEAKER_17]: do an amendment if member Mustone is in agreement and obviously the rest of the committee, be it further resolved that a policy will be created for a communication policy will be created for notifying families and students of the requirement for credit or credit remediation, credit recovery or remediation without a date attached to it.

1536
02:36:29,652 --> 02:36:34,116
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, without a specific number of days attached to it, but obviously before the end of the academic year.

1537
02:36:38,160 --> 02:36:41,961
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion for approval as amended by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Mustone.

1538
02:36:42,101 --> 02:36:42,362
[SPEAKER_12]: Mayor?

1539
02:36:43,062 --> 02:36:43,662
[SPEAKER_12]: Member Russell.

1540
02:36:45,343 --> 02:36:46,983
[SPEAKER_12]: Suzy, do you have that exact language?

1541
02:36:48,884 --> 02:36:49,564
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, thank you.

1542
02:36:51,585 --> 02:36:52,825
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, I'm supposed to do the roll call, aren't I?

1543
02:36:53,366 --> 02:36:54,886
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you don't have to do it.

1544
02:36:54,906 --> 02:36:55,606
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, sorry.

1545
02:36:56,507 --> 02:36:58,367
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh no, I'm sorry.

1546
02:36:58,968 --> 02:36:59,748
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

1547
02:36:59,768 --> 02:37:00,508
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

1548
02:37:00,548 --> 02:37:01,309
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

1549
02:37:01,589 --> 02:37:02,309
[SPEAKER_06]: Paper passes.

1550
02:37:03,172 --> 02:37:14,917
[SPEAKER_06]: Number eight, new business, the bullying prevention and intervention plan will be reviewed by the rules, policy and equity subcommittee for recommended updates offered by member Rousseau.

1551
02:37:15,157 --> 02:37:18,279
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion by member Rousseau, seconded by member Stone.

1552
02:37:18,299 --> 02:37:19,139
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

1553
02:37:19,159 --> 02:37:19,780
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

1554
02:37:20,140 --> 02:37:21,020
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

1555
02:37:21,560 --> 02:37:22,901
[SPEAKER_06]: Paper passes.

1556
02:37:23,881 --> 02:37:27,223
[SPEAKER_06]: Number two, policy BEDB, agenda creation and

1557
02:37:27,587 --> 02:37:34,032
[SPEAKER_06]: format for regular meetings of the school committee will be amended by the insertion of the member Rousseau.

1558
02:37:34,332 --> 02:37:36,534
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd like to make a motion to waive the reading of this.

1559
02:37:36,594 --> 02:37:41,697
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a rather technical motion and will not really come across well if it's read out loud.

1560
02:37:43,419 --> 02:37:43,759
[SPEAKER_06]: Second.

1561
02:37:44,219 --> 02:37:46,721
[SPEAKER_06]: Seconded for wavering of the reading.

1562
02:37:46,761 --> 02:37:47,682
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

1563
02:37:47,702 --> 02:37:48,442
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

1564
02:37:48,503 --> 02:37:49,283
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

1565
02:37:49,403 --> 02:37:50,424
[SPEAKER_06]: Paper passes.

1566
02:37:54,745 --> 02:37:56,227
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, if you could speak on it, that'd be great.

1567
02:37:56,688 --> 02:37:57,709
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1568
02:37:58,189 --> 02:38:02,295
[SPEAKER_12]: So this is an update to our policy BDB.

1569
02:38:02,355 --> 02:38:11,907
[SPEAKER_12]: Last year, we made some major renovations as an understatement to this policy, and I certainly saw that our renovations last year were a

1570
02:38:12,768 --> 02:38:14,249
[SPEAKER_12]: First, very good step.

1571
02:38:15,070 --> 02:38:26,078
[SPEAKER_12]: This is a step to offer us the ability to do what City Council does and what all legislative bodies do, and that is that all motions and resolutions put forth by the members

1572
02:38:26,703 --> 02:38:43,398
[SPEAKER_12]: get an actual number, so that instead of us talking about that thing we did that month ago and without having a number attached to it, it's challenging to talk about, but more importantly than how hard it is to talk about,

1573
02:38:44,094 --> 02:39:00,405
[SPEAKER_12]: it is really difficult to track, to track things that we send a subcommittee to track reports we've asked for, and they just become this big blob of things that hopefully can be taken care of.

1574
02:39:01,366 --> 02:39:03,807
[SPEAKER_12]: And so this change would actually add,

1575
02:39:06,469 --> 02:39:11,573
[SPEAKER_12]: the numbering system, and the numbering system that is proposed here matches the one that city council uses.

1576
02:39:11,593 --> 02:39:17,157
[SPEAKER_12]: I just thought it was important that we, within the city of Medford, have some consistency.

1577
02:39:17,257 --> 02:39:28,265
[SPEAKER_12]: So it would be the year, and it's the calendar year, and then a number, and the number is assigned by the superintendent's office as they receive motions and resolutions from members.

1578
02:39:30,026 --> 02:39:34,268
[SPEAKER_12]: and it's not really the most complicated thing.

1579
02:39:35,429 --> 02:39:50,356
[SPEAKER_12]: You would not know your number, but you would send in a request to get on the agenda, and a superintendent's executive assistant would reply, and instead of saying it's on the agenda, would also tell us what the number is for our own records.

1580
02:39:51,157 --> 02:39:51,337
[SPEAKER_12]: And...

1581
02:39:53,791 --> 02:39:58,297
[SPEAKER_12]: I included some examples because I personally find examples to be very helpful.

1582
02:39:58,977 --> 02:40:03,763
[SPEAKER_12]: It also includes a slight change to the format as it will appear on the agenda, but it is

1583
02:40:07,282 --> 02:40:11,526
[SPEAKER_12]: and there's an additional piece of information, two pieces of information.

1584
02:40:12,086 --> 02:40:15,409
[SPEAKER_12]: One is the meeting date requested and the submitted date.

1585
02:40:15,509 --> 02:40:28,480
[SPEAKER_12]: So you may recall in December, I had two motions related to discipline that appeared at a very inopportune time on the agenda, even though I had submitted them weeks ahead of time.

1586
02:40:29,040 --> 02:40:33,484
[SPEAKER_12]: So this just allows for clarification for when the member submitted it.

1587
02:40:34,364 --> 02:40:38,525
[SPEAKER_12]: and when the member expected it to be on the agenda.

1588
02:40:38,626 --> 02:40:42,087
[SPEAKER_12]: So, with, if there's any questions?

1589
02:40:45,308 --> 02:40:46,408
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion to approve.

1590
02:40:48,169 --> 02:40:52,890
[SPEAKER_08]: Graham, seconded by... Member, Ms.

1591
02:40:52,910 --> 02:40:53,370
[SPEAKER_06]: Stone, sorry.

1592
02:40:53,490 --> 02:40:54,551
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I had my hand up.

1593
02:40:54,671 --> 02:40:55,211
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

1594
02:40:55,231 --> 02:40:55,591
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

1595
02:40:55,651 --> 02:40:57,532
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't see it, I didn't see it.

1596
02:40:58,272 --> 02:41:01,873
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Ruseau, is, just because it's worthy,

1597
02:41:02,966 --> 02:41:11,828
[SPEAKER_03]: Can people, I know on the last meeting, people could still write to us, to the school committee email.

1598
02:41:12,028 --> 02:41:14,209
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm one ahead, I'm sorry.

1599
02:41:14,729 --> 02:41:16,129
[SPEAKER_05]: Mayor, point of order.

1600
02:41:17,330 --> 02:41:17,810
[SPEAKER_12]: Number two.

1601
02:41:18,070 --> 02:41:20,751
[SPEAKER_17]: Point of order, Member McLaughlin.

1602
02:41:21,171 --> 02:41:25,872
[SPEAKER_17]: Right, so just, I believe we had already approved number two.

1603
02:41:26,792 --> 02:41:28,633
[SPEAKER_17]: I thought we motioned and approved and all said aye.

1604
02:41:28,833 --> 02:41:29,613
[SPEAKER_12]: We waived the reading.

1605
02:41:31,178 --> 02:41:33,079
[SPEAKER_17]: And then didn't we motion to approve it to you, sure?

1606
02:41:33,239 --> 02:41:33,419
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1607
02:41:33,959 --> 02:41:34,259
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1608
02:41:34,280 --> 02:41:37,021
[SPEAKER_17]: I have to look back at the recording because I swore we did.

1609
02:41:37,581 --> 02:41:38,301
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

1610
02:41:40,202 --> 02:41:41,663
[SPEAKER_18]: Did you think you did?

1611
02:41:41,723 --> 02:41:42,904
[SPEAKER_12]: We waived the reading of it.

1612
02:41:47,566 --> 02:41:51,028
[SPEAKER_12]: So there was a, I believe member Graham, were there any answers?

1613
02:41:51,068 --> 02:41:51,368
[SPEAKER_17]: Second.

1614
02:41:52,261 --> 02:41:54,425
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Graham made a motion to approve and I'll second.

1615
02:41:54,465 --> 02:41:57,070
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion for approval by Member Graham, seconded by Member McLaughlin.

1616
02:41:57,090 --> 02:41:57,872
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

1617
02:41:58,112 --> 02:41:58,213
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

1618
02:41:58,473 --> 02:41:59,335
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

1619
02:41:59,996 --> 02:42:00,798
[SPEAKER_06]: Paper passes.

1620
02:42:01,339 --> 02:42:04,284
[SPEAKER_06]: Number three, policy BEDEB.

1621
02:42:05,035 --> 02:42:10,520
[SPEAKER_06]: agenda creation for format for regular meetings of the school committee.

1622
02:42:11,221 --> 02:42:11,541
[SPEAKER_06]: May I?

1623
02:42:11,861 --> 02:42:12,082
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1624
02:42:12,682 --> 02:42:15,104
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd like to make a motion to waive the reading of number three.

1625
02:42:15,285 --> 02:42:20,329
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to waive the reading by member Rousseau, seconded by member McLaughlin.

1626
02:42:20,349 --> 02:42:21,170
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

1627
02:42:21,651 --> 02:42:21,791
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

1628
02:42:21,911 --> 02:42:22,691
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

1629
02:42:23,532 --> 02:42:24,353
[SPEAKER_06]: Reading is waived.

1630
02:42:24,653 --> 02:42:25,154
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Ruseau.

1631
02:42:25,434 --> 02:42:25,794
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1632
02:42:26,154 --> 02:42:30,657
[SPEAKER_12]: This is actually an update to what is further up on our regular agenda.

1633
02:42:30,837 --> 02:42:44,926
[SPEAKER_12]: We had actually previously, we've already changed policy BDH around public participation at our last meeting, but we had, I had failed to realize that that language is actually present in another policy.

1634
02:42:45,306 --> 02:42:49,229
[SPEAKER_12]: So this just brings it in line with the other policy.

1635
02:42:49,369 --> 02:42:54,192
[SPEAKER_12]: So there's really, it's a policy that references another policy that didn't get updated.

1636
02:42:54,372 --> 02:42:54,532
[SPEAKER_12]: So.

1637
02:42:56,227 --> 02:42:57,448
[SPEAKER_12]: Any questions?

1638
02:42:57,528 --> 02:42:58,329
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I know, sorry.

1639
02:42:58,989 --> 02:42:59,830
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion to approve.

1640
02:43:00,770 --> 02:43:02,071
[SPEAKER_14]: Before we, I just have a question.

1641
02:43:04,313 --> 02:43:08,456
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, so I was a little confused when I read this.

1642
02:43:08,917 --> 02:43:24,108
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you taking out, like this is, the way I read this is that you're removing residents may also submit their comments by writing the superintendent prior to the meeting or by emailing and provide the school, you know, school committee email prior to or during the,

1643
02:43:24,756 --> 02:43:34,083
[SPEAKER_14]: item on the agenda, written comments must be kept to a length, which will allow them to be read into the record for less than three minutes, so forth, that whole sentence.

1644
02:43:35,003 --> 02:43:39,126
[SPEAKER_14]: And then it picks up a welcome inclusive community, which it picks up down here.

1645
02:43:39,666 --> 02:43:52,555
[SPEAKER_14]: So it does, the way that the new section that you want us to add in, the way I read it, is that we're removing that you can email the school committee.

1646
02:43:53,569 --> 02:43:57,071
[SPEAKER_14]: That's how I read it too, and I'm not okay with that.

1647
02:43:57,771 --> 02:43:58,791
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, member Ruseau.

1648
02:44:00,052 --> 02:44:03,273
[SPEAKER_12]: On January 10th, seven of us voted to do exactly that.

1649
02:44:04,294 --> 02:44:07,035
[SPEAKER_14]: Voted to use, to remove the school committee email?

1650
02:44:07,355 --> 02:44:07,755
[SPEAKER_12]: Correct.

1651
02:44:08,756 --> 02:44:11,477
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't remember doing that at all.

1652
02:44:12,317 --> 02:44:18,800
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure who, I think member McLaughlin just said my name and then member Graham.

1653
02:44:19,903 --> 02:44:21,524
[SPEAKER_17]: I was going to say, point of order.

1654
02:44:21,624 --> 02:44:33,070
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, I would recommend tabling this to clarify on it because I believe that we did say that we would not read the school committee.

1655
02:44:33,130 --> 02:44:41,734
[SPEAKER_17]: There was a certain qualification of how we would read the emails based on what the summarization or content of them was, I think.

1656
02:44:41,874 --> 02:44:45,957
[SPEAKER_17]: So, but instead of trying to at 9.30

1657
02:44:47,700 --> 02:44:51,603
[SPEAKER_17]: pull apart what we did and didn't do, since we don't have the reference to that with us now.

1658
02:44:52,103 --> 02:44:54,104
[SPEAKER_17]: Do we, do we have it in the minutes?

1659
02:44:54,124 --> 02:44:54,724
[SPEAKER_17]: You have it right there?

1660
02:44:55,185 --> 02:44:55,425
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1661
02:44:56,025 --> 02:44:56,305
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

1662
02:44:56,365 --> 02:44:58,627
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, feel free to read it if you will.

1663
02:45:00,288 --> 02:45:00,628
[SPEAKER_09]: Mayor?

1664
02:45:02,449 --> 02:45:04,610
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure I'm next.

1665
02:45:05,311 --> 02:45:08,512
[SPEAKER_06]: Will you yield to, do you want member Graham, then member Ruseau?

1666
02:45:09,313 --> 02:45:13,335
[SPEAKER_15]: So at the last meeting, I think there's two, there's two different parts of this.

1667
02:45:14,056 --> 02:45:16,017
[SPEAKER_15]: One is there's an email address.

1668
02:45:16,999 --> 02:45:20,581
[SPEAKER_15]: people can write to us at that still exists.

1669
02:45:21,241 --> 02:45:24,942
[SPEAKER_15]: What is different now is that that just will auto forward to all of us.

1670
02:45:24,962 --> 02:45:26,903
[SPEAKER_15]: So we all get to see what is there.

1671
02:45:27,904 --> 02:45:30,225
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, that is different than

1672
02:45:32,345 --> 02:45:34,006
[SPEAKER_15]: what we did in the last meeting.

1673
02:45:34,046 --> 02:45:37,609
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's not, that part is sort of new, which we did in the last meeting.

1674
02:45:37,689 --> 02:45:48,577
[SPEAKER_15]: The other thing we did in last week's meeting was say, we are no longer going to read all of those things out at school committees, because instead we're sending it to all of us.

1675
02:45:49,238 --> 02:45:51,079
[SPEAKER_15]: We all can ask those questions.

1676
02:45:51,620 --> 02:46:00,927
[SPEAKER_15]: So all this is doing is truing up the policy with the vote that we took last week, which was to say, if you would like to speak at school committee meetings,

1677
02:46:01,502 --> 02:46:05,923
[SPEAKER_15]: You can continue to do so in person and you can continue to do so on Zoom.

1678
02:46:06,683 --> 02:46:10,024
[SPEAKER_15]: Separately, you can write and all of us will get your email.

1679
02:46:10,704 --> 02:46:16,925
[SPEAKER_15]: We may choose to ask those questions or whatever it is in the meeting, or we may reach out to you.

1680
02:46:17,525 --> 02:46:27,087
[SPEAKER_15]: But if you want to participate in the meetings, you're not emailing us a laundry list of questions anymore.

1681
02:46:27,827 --> 02:46:30,548
[SPEAKER_15]: You are either coming in person or coming on Zoom to do that.

1682
02:46:31,401 --> 02:46:44,131
[SPEAKER_15]: the email address continuing to be operational is important because then we all six can see, seven, can see what is coming into that email box and figure out how we each individually want to respond.

1683
02:46:44,692 --> 02:46:45,753
[SPEAKER_15]: That is what we did last week.

1684
02:46:45,893 --> 02:46:50,216
[SPEAKER_15]: And all this is doing is changing our policy to reflect that.

1685
02:46:52,518 --> 02:46:54,059
[SPEAKER_06]: So is there a motion on the floor?

1686
02:46:54,079 --> 02:46:55,941
[SPEAKER_06]: We have two over here, actually.

1687
02:46:56,341 --> 02:47:00,365
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Kreatz, Member McLaughlin, Member Ruseau.

1688
02:47:02,018 --> 02:47:03,339
[SPEAKER_14]: I just had a follow up question.

1689
02:47:03,439 --> 02:47:14,387
[SPEAKER_14]: So since the community can still write to that email address, you know, is there anywhere in this policy where we can state that

1690
02:47:15,397 --> 02:47:28,200
[SPEAKER_14]: you can continue to send your emails to this email, because like right now we're just removing that entire, you know, that piece about writing to the email and that the email will be received by all school committee members.

1691
02:47:28,240 --> 02:47:31,720
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, they will be copied on all, you know, all those emails.

1692
02:47:32,421 --> 02:47:44,183
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there any way we can incorporate that here, you know, just a statement, you know, for transparency reasons that, you know, you can still continue to write this email address?

1693
02:47:45,175 --> 02:47:52,120
[SPEAKER_14]: because I really honestly, you know, I just remembered us, the situation happening differently.

1694
02:47:52,140 --> 02:48:00,325
[SPEAKER_14]: I do remember that Mr. Russo wasn't going to read all the statements or make a determination on whether some could be read or some could not be read.

1695
02:48:01,726 --> 02:48:10,211
[SPEAKER_14]: But I do think that we should, you know, continue to keep the email address, you know, for transparency reasons.

1696
02:48:14,001 --> 02:48:15,443
[SPEAKER_12]: Point of information, excuse me.

1697
02:48:15,463 --> 02:48:16,925
[SPEAKER_12]: Point of information.

1698
02:48:17,827 --> 02:48:19,669
[SPEAKER_12]: The email address is in the policy.

1699
02:48:22,213 --> 02:48:27,762
[SPEAKER_14]: In the policy, but not in this language that's going to go on the agenda.

1700
02:48:28,402 --> 02:48:28,543
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

1701
02:48:32,127 --> 02:48:34,569
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Cressy, maybe just something at the bottom.

1702
02:48:34,589 --> 02:48:40,572
[SPEAKER_06]: This email address is still active and it will be, each member will receive it.

1703
02:48:41,292 --> 02:48:46,175
[SPEAKER_14]: I think even just a little asterisk with the footnote, I think would be helpful for the community.

1704
02:48:47,916 --> 02:48:53,500
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just gonna be one little, you know, italicized footnote.

1705
02:48:57,162 --> 02:48:58,783
[SPEAKER_12]: No, that's not it.

1706
02:49:00,157 --> 02:49:02,881
[SPEAKER_12]: Policy BEDH, Unarmed Policy Manual.

1707
02:49:05,264 --> 02:49:09,649
[SPEAKER_17]: So, point of information, Member McLaughlin.

1708
02:49:09,869 --> 02:49:16,618
[SPEAKER_17]: I think part of the issue is that nobody has a policy manual, and that was one of the things that I wanted to sort of

1709
02:49:17,140 --> 02:49:32,108
[SPEAKER_17]: ask about and bring up is that there's a policy manual that's on the website that a lot of which was adopted by the MASC, some of which has been changed by the school committee, this body, after recommendations by the rules policy.

1710
02:49:32,830 --> 02:49:34,171
[SPEAKER_17]: Rules subcommittee.

1711
02:49:34,552 --> 02:49:45,942
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think part of the problem is that we're looking at new policy compared to, or we're not looking at compared to old policy because none of us has a policy manual.

1712
02:49:46,502 --> 02:49:54,809
[SPEAKER_17]: I know that in a moment, we're going to be talking about a number of proposed rules, but I think that this is just, is part of the confusion.

1713
02:49:55,270 --> 02:49:57,051
[SPEAKER_17]: And I would also just add, if I may,

1714
02:49:58,190 --> 02:50:05,832
[SPEAKER_17]: that just to be clear for residents that are listening or will listen later, that there are a number of ways obviously to contact us.

1715
02:50:06,092 --> 02:50:08,733
[SPEAKER_17]: One is through this group email.

1716
02:50:09,193 --> 02:50:10,553
[SPEAKER_17]: Also another is individually.

1717
02:50:10,733 --> 02:50:26,838
[SPEAKER_17]: And yes, we may or may not bring those things forward as questions in the school committee, but you can also obviously ask your school committee member or anybody within the school committee, the mayor, whoever, if they would consider putting something on the agenda that is of importance.

1718
02:50:27,598 --> 02:50:28,798
[SPEAKER_17]: that they feel is of importance.

1719
02:50:28,838 --> 02:50:37,200
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not just a matter of you can only email us, that they also, you know, can ask if we would consider putting something on the agenda or requesting that something's put on the agenda.

1720
02:50:37,540 --> 02:50:46,623
[SPEAKER_17]: Does not mean that it will be, that it may not be, but there are a number of ways to sort of move policy or policy requests forward.

1721
02:50:46,663 --> 02:50:48,683
[SPEAKER_17]: And I want to make sure that folks understand that.

1722
02:50:48,843 --> 02:50:54,064
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think that that necessarily has to be written into this piece, but I just wanted to say that out loud.

1723
02:50:54,845 --> 02:50:56,445
[SPEAKER_17]: And I would suggest that we,

1724
02:50:57,104 --> 02:50:58,204
[SPEAKER_17]: get a policy manual.

1725
02:50:58,325 --> 02:51:00,665
[SPEAKER_17]: I think reading it on the website has been really cumbersome.

1726
02:51:00,785 --> 02:51:11,770
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's also the BEDH and the BEDA and the BED, it's just sort of like, I don't even think people know what the acronym stands for, which is more just a numbering system that I think MASC created.

1727
02:51:12,550 --> 02:51:13,290
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you.

1728
02:51:17,032 --> 02:51:19,073
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, member McLaughlin.

1729
02:51:19,373 --> 02:51:20,373
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Ruseau.

1730
02:51:21,414 --> 02:51:25,015
[SPEAKER_12]: I just think that not passing this means that we have a policy we approved.

1731
02:51:26,278 --> 02:51:29,459
[SPEAKER_12]: and we say something completely different on our actual agenda.

1732
02:51:30,899 --> 02:51:39,162
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I'm not really, if the policy we approved last week, people have a problem with, we can totally revisit it and change it, but we shouldn't have a policy that says this.

1733
02:51:39,722 --> 02:51:47,505
[SPEAKER_12]: And then the physical agenda we're sending out this week, and then presumably the next time, if we don't pass this, will be completely wrong.

1734
02:51:48,185 --> 02:51:51,746
[SPEAKER_12]: It will say, you can email, and you will have it read out loud.

1735
02:51:52,792 --> 02:51:53,272
[SPEAKER_12]: And guess what?

1736
02:51:53,512 --> 02:51:55,713
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not going to happen because that's not our policy.

1737
02:51:55,913 --> 02:51:57,653
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just what's printed on the agenda right now.

1738
02:51:58,233 --> 02:52:05,415
[SPEAKER_12]: So, I mean, I'm a little surprised about this conversation because that was what we changed in the last meeting.

1739
02:52:06,555 --> 02:52:13,217
[SPEAKER_12]: This was just record keeping to clear things up so that they were correct with what we already approved.

1740
02:52:14,298 --> 02:52:26,429
[SPEAKER_06]: what about just a line at the end, please note the policy change that the email address will not go to the committee members at any time they're given and will not be read in the council, in the record.

1741
02:52:26,809 --> 02:52:28,331
[SPEAKER_12]: You're gonna have to read that at every meeting.

1742
02:52:30,252 --> 02:52:30,412
Okay.

1743
02:52:30,733 --> 02:52:34,816
[SPEAKER_18]: You have me reading four pages every meeting, not a sentence.

1744
02:52:34,896 --> 02:52:39,461
[SPEAKER_12]: But Mayor, I mean, the goal of this was also to dramatically reduce the amount of this stuff you have to read.

1745
02:52:39,541 --> 02:52:40,662
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you wanna add more to read,

1746
02:52:41,689 --> 02:52:42,250
[SPEAKER_12]: That's up to you.

1747
02:52:42,310 --> 02:52:49,078
[SPEAKER_06]: We can even put it on for three months time, the last sentence, and then hopefully people will pardon me for three months.

1748
02:52:50,280 --> 02:52:50,620
[SPEAKER_06]: How's that?

1749
02:52:54,447 --> 02:52:55,067
[SPEAKER_12]: What are we doing?

1750
02:52:55,147 --> 02:52:55,627
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Graham.

1751
02:52:56,008 --> 02:53:19,037
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion to approve with the amendment that for the remainder of the school year, we will add a note that says, please note your email to the Medford School Committee email address has been automatically forwarded to all six members of the committee and will not be read, seven, sorry, and will not be read into the record as has been past practice.

1752
02:53:19,897 --> 02:53:20,237
[SPEAKER_06]: Second.

1753
02:53:20,277 --> 02:53:21,738
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion for approval as amended.

1754
02:53:24,985 --> 02:53:27,826
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Graham.

1755
02:53:28,086 --> 02:53:29,006
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

1756
02:53:29,026 --> 02:53:29,486
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

1757
02:53:29,766 --> 02:53:30,547
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

1758
02:53:31,187 --> 02:53:32,667
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes as amended.

1759
02:53:32,687 --> 02:53:34,768
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1760
02:53:36,468 --> 02:53:39,469
[SPEAKER_06]: Member, so I don't know if you want table number five.

1761
02:53:40,129 --> 02:53:40,849
[SPEAKER_12]: Number five?

1762
02:53:41,789 --> 02:53:43,750
[SPEAKER_06]: Number, I'm sorry, number three on page five.

1763
02:53:43,770 --> 02:53:45,991
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, absolutely.

1764
02:53:46,051 --> 02:53:49,872
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not tabling number, the number, the second number three.

1765
02:53:49,892 --> 02:53:49,932
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

1766
02:53:53,697 --> 02:53:54,757
[SPEAKER_12]: Can you repeat yourself, please?

1767
02:53:55,438 --> 02:53:57,138
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I would not like to table number three.

1768
02:53:58,479 --> 02:54:02,000
[SPEAKER_12]: I've worked for three and a half years on this document, and we don't have a set of rules.

1769
02:54:02,220 --> 02:54:03,080
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not tabling it.

1770
02:54:03,500 --> 02:54:13,383
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Wiseau, could I just say that it's a robust document that's 16 pages long, and I'm just wondering to start that conversation at 9.35.

1771
02:54:16,714 --> 02:54:26,139
[SPEAKER_13]: I promise I can cut my portion of the agenda down to like three reports next week and let us spend a good amount of time going through the rules.

1772
02:54:26,599 --> 02:54:38,024
[SPEAKER_13]: I know you spent a lot of time, but I just feel like for the amount of information that's in there, we should probably have a richer conversation where we're probably more alert.

1773
02:54:41,243 --> 02:54:53,280
[SPEAKER_13]: I would love tabling, but I know you guys make the decision, but just the hour is late and I feel like sometimes we get to such a late hour and then when we're talking about something that's so substantive.

1774
02:54:56,051 --> 02:55:00,993
[SPEAKER_13]: people are not bringing their A game and they don't remember parts of the conversation.

1775
02:55:01,613 --> 02:55:06,394
[SPEAKER_13]: Votes are being, you know, taken and they don't remember or don't recall everything.

1776
02:55:07,115 --> 02:55:11,636
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I'm just wondering where that's a significant amount of information.

1777
02:55:11,696 --> 02:55:22,379
[SPEAKER_13]: It's very lengthy that, um, I was going to request if we could potentially table it because there is a lot of work there and I want to give it the time that it deserves.

1778
02:55:23,960 --> 02:55:24,140
[SPEAKER_12]: Mayor?

1779
02:55:25,538 --> 02:55:26,179
[SPEAKER_12]: Member Ruseau?

1780
02:55:26,740 --> 02:55:29,823
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd be fine with setting up a committee of the whole for later this week.

1781
02:55:32,646 --> 02:55:36,351
[SPEAKER_12]: But I mean, how many years can a school committee go without a set of rules?

1782
02:55:36,751 --> 02:55:41,076
[SPEAKER_12]: Apparently generations, but I mean, come on, time's up.

1783
02:55:42,359 --> 02:55:43,219
[SPEAKER_12]: It's kind of crazy.

1784
02:55:43,360 --> 02:55:46,281
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, we have a new member here who has no idea how we operate.

1785
02:55:46,701 --> 02:55:47,201
[SPEAKER_12]: No idea.

1786
02:55:47,802 --> 02:55:48,362
[SPEAKER_12]: And guess what?

1787
02:55:49,182 --> 02:55:55,326
[SPEAKER_12]: Half the members in this room have asked me the same questions over and over and over again in my four years.

1788
02:55:57,687 --> 02:56:00,748
[SPEAKER_06]: Good news is that we probably, most of us at least have read them.

1789
02:56:00,968 --> 02:56:02,509
[SPEAKER_06]: I've read them today.

1790
02:56:02,889 --> 02:56:03,510
[SPEAKER_12]: I couldn't hear you.

1791
02:56:04,782 --> 02:56:05,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I make a point of information?

1792
02:56:06,023 --> 02:56:11,845
[SPEAKER_06]: It's getting us moving on, you know, really solidifying them, but I have about 20 comments on my own, so.

1793
02:56:12,246 --> 02:56:14,066
[SPEAKER_17]: I would just like to make a point of information, though.

1794
02:56:14,867 --> 02:56:26,192
[SPEAKER_17]: I know, and I do, it's a tremendous amount of work, and I can see that through the Chair to Member Ruseau, and I think it does bear more thought and more time, and I know myself, you know, this came

1795
02:56:27,721 --> 02:56:29,483
[SPEAKER_17]: I received it on Thursday in a packet.

1796
02:56:29,723 --> 02:56:32,586
[SPEAKER_17]: My two children went away to college this weekend.

1797
02:56:32,646 --> 02:56:37,290
[SPEAKER_17]: My littlest one had, you know, a significant doctor's appointment.

1798
02:56:37,450 --> 02:56:42,255
[SPEAKER_17]: I did not really get to give this the attention that I would like to and do some comparison to.

1799
02:56:42,853 --> 02:56:44,154
[SPEAKER_17]: the policy that is posted.

1800
02:56:44,234 --> 02:57:01,781
[SPEAKER_17]: So while I guess I'm not understanding, and maybe member Ruseau can clarify when you say that there's been no, have traditionally, the rules of the school committee have traditionally been passed down through the experience of members, but there are rules and policy listed on the website.

1801
02:57:02,521 --> 02:57:08,264
[SPEAKER_17]: So I don't know, I'm not sure through the chair, I'm not sure why, I know that they need to be changed.

1802
02:57:08,304 --> 02:57:09,044
[SPEAKER_17]: I couldn't agree more.

1803
02:57:09,084 --> 02:57:10,665
[SPEAKER_17]: And I would actually suggest that this,

1804
02:57:11,456 --> 02:57:15,919
[SPEAKER_17]: be moved to the Rules Subcommittee so that we can actually really vet it and go through it.

1805
02:57:15,939 --> 02:57:22,303
[SPEAKER_17]: And I can see why you would say Committee of the Whole, but I think that that's why we have the Rules Subcommittee too, so thank you.

1806
02:57:25,125 --> 02:57:26,586
[SPEAKER_06]: So is that a motion, Member McLaughlin?

1807
02:57:27,306 --> 02:57:27,827
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, ma'am.

1808
02:57:28,487 --> 02:57:32,269
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to move to the Rules Subcommittee by Member McLaughlin.

1809
02:57:34,131 --> 02:57:36,072
[SPEAKER_03]: That doesn't help, the people not on the Rules Committee.

1810
02:57:36,212 --> 02:57:37,673
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I was gonna say,

1811
02:57:38,405 --> 02:57:41,046
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I think, point of information, if I may, Mayor.

1812
02:57:41,426 --> 02:57:43,667
[SPEAKER_17]: Member McLaughlin, point of information.

1813
02:57:43,827 --> 02:57:47,908
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it gives people the opportunity, two things, it does two things.

1814
02:57:47,968 --> 02:57:52,289
[SPEAKER_17]: It gives people the opportunity to review the document and have some time to review the document.

1815
02:57:52,309 --> 02:57:53,730
[SPEAKER_17]: Point of information.

1816
02:57:56,510 --> 02:57:59,711
[SPEAKER_06]: Just finish yours and then we'll go right to Member Ruseau's point of information.

1817
02:58:00,312 --> 02:58:00,972
[SPEAKER_17]: And then it has,

1818
02:58:01,980 --> 02:58:10,164
[SPEAKER_17]: the opportunity for the rules subcommittee to go through and make sure that things have been covered for all our students.

1819
02:58:10,204 --> 02:58:10,564
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1820
02:58:11,124 --> 02:58:12,405
[SPEAKER_12]: Members, so point of information.

1821
02:58:12,665 --> 02:58:13,045
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1822
02:58:13,585 --> 02:58:15,106
[SPEAKER_12]: I appreciate that we all have busy lives.

1823
02:58:15,226 --> 02:58:18,067
[SPEAKER_12]: I sent this to all members over two weeks ago.

1824
02:58:19,408 --> 02:58:26,491
[SPEAKER_12]: So, I mean, the policies on our policy manual is not a rules document for members.

1825
02:58:28,592 --> 02:58:30,533
[SPEAKER_12]: And I mean,

1826
02:58:32,736 --> 02:58:39,921
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not interested in operating in an essentially lawless environment, which is what we've done for the four years I've been on this committee.

1827
02:58:41,682 --> 02:58:46,586
[SPEAKER_12]: Basic questions, none of us could agree right now what those answers are.

1828
02:58:47,806 --> 02:58:50,188
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's just, it's embarrassing.

1829
02:58:50,488 --> 02:58:51,309
[SPEAKER_12]: It is embarrassing.

1830
02:58:52,089 --> 02:59:00,935
[SPEAKER_12]: So, and I'm personally opposed to sending it back to my own subcommittee to talk about with myself and Melanie and member McLaughlin and member Graham.

1831
02:59:02,662 --> 02:59:06,004
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, all of us don't get to actually have a conversation about it there.

1832
02:59:06,424 --> 02:59:16,790
[SPEAKER_12]: So Committee of the Whole is absolutely the only place, because, I mean, the mayor has comments, other people have comments, they won't get to be heard at a subcommittee.

1833
02:59:16,910 --> 02:59:25,635
[SPEAKER_17]: I would remove that motion, and I would agree, if I may, with the Committee of the Whole, I would remove the motion, Mayor, for the referral to the Rural Subcommittee.

1834
02:59:26,355 --> 02:59:29,197
[SPEAKER_17]: But we're talking about a multi-year effort,

1835
02:59:30,762 --> 02:59:43,447
[SPEAKER_17]: I guess I would say by whom, and it sounds like it was by Member Ruseau, which I think is, you know, valiant, but also it's a seven-member body and we really need time to digest.

1836
02:59:44,827 --> 02:59:55,231
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm sorry if, you know, the busyness of our lives has not provided in the two weeks to read the 18-page rule document, but I also wanna compare it to the previous policy, thank you.

1837
02:59:56,611 --> 02:59:57,191
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Kreatz?

1838
02:59:58,112 --> 02:59:58,352
[SPEAKER_14]: Mayor,

1839
02:59:59,307 --> 03:00:05,333
[SPEAKER_14]: I would like to motion that we move this to a committee of the whole meeting so that all members can participate.

1840
03:00:05,733 --> 03:00:08,476
[SPEAKER_14]: I read through the rules.

1841
03:00:08,556 --> 03:00:14,462
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to first thank member Ruseau for putting this together in the time and effort that he must have spent putting this together.

1842
03:00:14,502 --> 03:00:17,665
[SPEAKER_14]: And as he mentioned in the email, he spent three years.

1843
03:00:18,145 --> 03:00:20,488
[SPEAKER_14]: So I don't think it's appropriate for us tonight

1844
03:00:21,008 --> 03:00:28,431
[SPEAKER_14]: to go through a document that he spent three years working on, and we're not gonna be able to provide our input.

1845
03:00:28,451 --> 03:00:33,994
[SPEAKER_14]: We need to be able to provide some input and feedback and possible amendments.

1846
03:00:34,634 --> 03:00:41,377
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think the only way we can do this is with a committee of the whole and going through line by line.

1847
03:00:41,537 --> 03:00:50,381
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, I don't think some of the numbers necessarily, I don't have an issue with all the numbers, but I do have many questions on many numbers.

1848
03:00:51,055 --> 03:00:54,896
[SPEAKER_14]: and I think we could go through it and go through like a set of 10.

1849
03:00:55,777 --> 03:00:57,397
[SPEAKER_14]: One to 10, approve, yes or no.

1850
03:00:57,817 --> 03:00:59,778
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, what number do we wanna discuss?

1851
03:01:00,158 --> 03:01:11,001
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think we have to go through every single solitary number, but we need to do this as a group and not through a rule subcommittee, then come back here, and then we have more questions, and then it's just gonna go on.

1852
03:01:11,601 --> 03:01:13,922
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think the only way we could do this is with the Committee of the Whole.

1853
03:01:13,942 --> 03:01:14,522
[SPEAKER_14]: And then we can have a motion.

1854
03:01:14,542 --> 03:01:19,224
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion for Committee of the Whole meeting by Member Kreatz, seconded by Member McLaughlin.

1855
03:01:19,244 --> 03:01:19,984
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

1856
03:01:20,444 --> 03:01:21,545
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll oppose.

1857
03:01:21,585 --> 03:01:21,905
[SPEAKER_06]: Mayor.

1858
03:01:23,367 --> 03:01:25,208
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Ruseau, motion's been called.

1859
03:01:25,909 --> 03:01:26,249
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1860
03:01:26,429 --> 03:01:29,892
[SPEAKER_12]: If people can get their calendars out, how's the time to schedule?

1861
03:01:29,912 --> 03:01:31,193
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1862
03:01:32,514 --> 03:01:33,695
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd like to, Mayor, may I?

1863
03:01:34,435 --> 03:01:35,196
[SPEAKER_17]: Member McLaughlin.

1864
03:01:35,676 --> 03:01:47,166
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd like to request, I don't think it needs to be in a form of a motion, but if it does, I can, but is there a way that we can get hard copies of the current policy that's posted on the website?

1865
03:01:47,646 --> 03:01:48,747
[SPEAKER_12]: Mayor, point of information.

1866
03:01:50,076 --> 03:01:51,496
[SPEAKER_17]: What information member Ruseau?

1867
03:01:51,736 --> 03:01:52,397
[SPEAKER_12]: There isn't one.

1868
03:01:53,457 --> 03:01:53,717
[SPEAKER_17]: I know.

1869
03:01:53,817 --> 03:01:55,618
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm asking if one could be created.

1870
03:01:55,678 --> 03:01:58,478
[SPEAKER_17]: It's cut and paste of what's on there and put it into a document.

1871
03:01:59,579 --> 03:02:00,579
[SPEAKER_12]: So that we can get a hard copy.

1872
03:02:00,599 --> 03:02:02,399
[SPEAKER_12]: The rules document is not a policy.

1873
03:02:02,900 --> 03:02:04,620
[SPEAKER_12]: Like MASC is policies.

1874
03:02:07,241 --> 03:02:07,901
[SPEAKER_12]: These are rules.

1875
03:02:08,321 --> 03:02:11,022
[SPEAKER_08]: These are telling us how we're going to operate.

1876
03:02:15,235 --> 03:02:17,415
[SPEAKER_08]: So these are not policy, these are rules?

1877
03:02:18,056 --> 03:02:21,556
[SPEAKER_12]: Some of these rules reference policies, but most of them do not.

1878
03:02:21,816 --> 03:02:29,398
[SPEAKER_17]: Right, which I think is more reason that we need to have a printout of the policies that we currently have up on the website for what we have to compare them against the rules, please.

1879
03:02:31,018 --> 03:02:31,238
[SPEAKER_12]: Mayor?

1880
03:02:32,058 --> 03:02:32,598
[SPEAKER_12]: Member Ruseau.

1881
03:02:33,358 --> 03:02:36,139
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, you can go to the policy manual and hit the print button.

1882
03:02:36,759 --> 03:02:38,799
[SPEAKER_12]: There's hundreds, if not thousands.

1883
03:02:39,280 --> 03:02:41,040
[SPEAKER_12]: Are you asking that somebody

1884
03:02:41,945 --> 03:02:57,412
[SPEAKER_12]: is dedicated to copying, pasting out of a online repository and creating a document that you can then review, because it will be hundreds, if not thousands of pages long, because it is policies on every aspect of public schools.

1885
03:02:58,412 --> 03:03:00,233
[SPEAKER_12]: There is no rules manual.

1886
03:03:00,293 --> 03:03:01,834
[SPEAKER_12]: There's no comparison to.

1887
03:03:02,754 --> 03:03:07,957
[SPEAKER_12]: That is the main reason that I spent this time, because it's embarrassing that we don't have one.

1888
03:03:10,258 --> 03:03:10,718
[SPEAKER_17]: Mayor, may I?

1889
03:03:12,119 --> 03:03:12,880
[SPEAKER_17]: Member McLaughlin.

1890
03:03:13,600 --> 03:03:21,345
[SPEAKER_17]: I would be willing to volunteer to take the document to a copy store and have copies made for the school committee.

1891
03:03:23,127 --> 03:03:33,173
[SPEAKER_06]: What if we just open up the links because you can grab them right from the actual rules and we put them into a Google Doc for everybody to see?

1892
03:03:33,193 --> 03:03:37,857
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't need a copy because I can see the links.

1893
03:03:46,661 --> 03:03:49,423
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm having a hard time hearing people tonight too.

1894
03:03:49,784 --> 03:03:50,484
[SPEAKER_17]: Can you hear me now?

1895
03:03:50,844 --> 03:03:51,285
[SPEAKER_06]: No, we can't.

1896
03:03:51,565 --> 03:03:52,226
[SPEAKER_17]: Can you hear me now?

1897
03:03:53,406 --> 03:03:54,547
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the masks, I think.

1898
03:03:54,948 --> 03:03:56,529
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, so I don't know.

1899
03:03:56,889 --> 03:04:08,398
[SPEAKER_17]: Because it's so cumbersome and there are 18 pages here, and then like as Member Ruseau was saying, there's so many on the policy, and these are rules that reflect policy and policy that reflects rules.

1900
03:04:08,498 --> 03:04:10,320
[SPEAKER_17]: I think we do need to do a comparison.

1901
03:04:11,000 --> 03:04:19,429
[SPEAKER_17]: And I don't think we're going to have, in a committee of the whole, the ability to do that, you know, with our computers and, you know, what have you, in this hard document.

1902
03:04:19,829 --> 03:04:20,950
[SPEAKER_17]: And so, I don't know.

1903
03:04:21,551 --> 03:04:22,312
[SPEAKER_17]: Call me old-fashioned.

1904
03:04:22,352 --> 03:04:25,375
[SPEAKER_17]: I guess I work well with the papers beside each other.

1905
03:04:25,875 --> 03:04:27,557
[SPEAKER_17]: But if no one else wants a copy, that's fine.

1906
03:04:27,597 --> 03:04:29,579
[SPEAKER_17]: I can make a copy.

1907
03:04:29,599 --> 03:04:30,520
[SPEAKER_12]: It's 350 pages.

1908
03:04:39,585 --> 03:04:42,026
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, no motion because we already voted on the motion.

1909
03:04:42,066 --> 03:04:42,746
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to move on.

1910
03:04:43,187 --> 03:04:45,708
[SPEAKER_12]: Mayor, we were going to schedule this now.

1911
03:04:47,849 --> 03:04:50,650
[SPEAKER_06]: I can do that tomorrow and reach out, see when everybody's available.

1912
03:04:50,970 --> 03:04:51,470
[SPEAKER_12]: For this week?

1913
03:04:51,490 --> 03:04:54,152
[SPEAKER_06]: That's okay.

1914
03:04:54,252 --> 03:04:57,673
[SPEAKER_06]: We only have the option of Thursday, Friday, so.

1915
03:04:58,413 --> 03:04:59,054
[SPEAKER_12]: So Thursday?

1916
03:04:59,914 --> 03:05:03,796
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not available Thursday, but I was thinking sometime next week.

1917
03:05:04,496 --> 03:05:05,457
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll try to coordinate.

1918
03:05:07,558 --> 03:05:08,258
[SPEAKER_12]: And we're all here.

1919
03:05:08,920 --> 03:05:13,762
[SPEAKER_12]: If we do emails and texts, I mean, it's gonna drag it out for days to get this done.

1920
03:05:14,562 --> 03:05:20,644
[SPEAKER_06]: No, she can't.

1921
03:05:23,966 --> 03:05:25,706
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, she's not able to come, sorry, yes.

1922
03:05:25,966 --> 03:05:29,468
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought, just meant like, I was worried about the meeting.

1923
03:05:34,549 --> 03:05:36,010
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, five o'clock on Monday?

1924
03:05:38,448 --> 03:05:40,128
[SPEAKER_08]: Can we do Tuesday the 1st?

1925
03:05:40,669 --> 03:05:41,669
[SPEAKER_08]: Tuesday the 1st works.

1926
03:05:45,730 --> 03:05:47,871
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, we'll try for Tuesday.

1927
03:05:48,331 --> 03:05:49,591
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

1928
03:05:49,611 --> 03:05:50,091
[SPEAKER_12]: Tuesday the 1st.

1929
03:05:50,111 --> 03:05:51,432
[SPEAKER_12]: Can we make sure it's not an hour?

1930
03:05:51,452 --> 03:05:57,193
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, if people are going to want to go line by line, I don't think an hour is a rational number.

1931
03:05:57,333 --> 03:06:03,255
[SPEAKER_12]: And if we do small sections at a time, it'll be 2023 before we've even gotten through the document.

1932
03:06:10,049 --> 03:06:10,489
[SPEAKER_06]: Here we go.

1933
03:06:11,250 --> 03:06:12,511
[SPEAKER_06]: Number three, the rules.

1934
03:06:13,051 --> 03:06:14,892
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, sorry.

1935
03:06:16,153 --> 03:06:25,279
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, you're not gonna be able to do the first?

1936
03:06:31,623 --> 03:06:32,043
[SPEAKER_08]: The third?

1937
03:06:32,063 --> 03:06:37,146
[SPEAKER_08]: Or could we do it with the five o'clock on the 20?

1938
03:06:39,910 --> 03:06:41,791
[SPEAKER_08]: On the seventh?

1939
03:06:43,092 --> 03:06:43,853
[SPEAKER_08]: When we're here anyway?

1940
03:06:45,194 --> 03:06:45,414
[SPEAKER_08]: Dinner?

1941
03:06:45,434 --> 03:06:50,798
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we all get very tired when we have those meetings.

1942
03:06:50,998 --> 03:06:51,878
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.

1943
03:06:52,339 --> 03:06:55,621
[SPEAKER_08]: But we're all always available that evening.

1944
03:06:57,762 --> 03:06:58,863
[SPEAKER_03]: Wednesday's not going to be there?

1945
03:07:01,025 --> 03:07:02,946
[SPEAKER_15]: Can we do Thursday the third on Zoom?

1946
03:07:04,407 --> 03:07:06,448
[SPEAKER_15]: So we can actually look at the document?

1947
03:07:06,508 --> 03:07:06,749
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1948
03:07:06,789 --> 03:07:07,049
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1949
03:07:07,129 --> 03:07:07,829
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a good idea.

1950
03:07:08,070 --> 03:07:08,290
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1951
03:07:09,188 --> 03:07:10,208
[SPEAKER_06]: I would assume it's better.

1952
03:07:12,069 --> 03:07:12,889
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, yes.

1953
03:07:13,969 --> 03:07:15,230
[SPEAKER_06]: And what's the earliest we could start?

1954
03:07:17,090 --> 03:07:17,770
[SPEAKER_06]: Kathy, you would.

1955
03:07:17,790 --> 03:07:17,770
4, 430.

1956
03:07:18,051 --> 03:07:20,911
[SPEAKER_06]: 4, 430.

1957
03:07:19,511 --> 03:07:20,911
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all good.

1958
03:07:20,931 --> 03:07:22,272
[SPEAKER_06]: 4 o'clock on the 3rd by Zoom.

1959
03:07:22,352 --> 03:07:25,393
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, 4 o'clock on the 3rd by Zoom.

1960
03:07:43,733 --> 03:07:49,720
[SPEAKER_06]: Page 6, number 5, policy BEDC quorum.

1961
03:07:49,860 --> 03:07:55,246
[SPEAKER_06]: Four members of the committee shall constitute quorum, but a smaller number may meet and adjourn from day to day.

1962
03:07:55,266 --> 03:07:58,169
[SPEAKER_06]: Offered by Member Ruseau.

1963
03:07:58,910 --> 03:07:59,110
[SPEAKER_12]: May I?

1964
03:07:59,895 --> 03:08:00,535
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Ruseau.

1965
03:08:00,595 --> 03:08:00,935
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1966
03:08:01,556 --> 03:08:12,819
[SPEAKER_12]: This is a motion to repeal this policy, which does not exist in the policy manual anymore, and it smells a bit like something that might have existed before open meeting law, frankly.

1967
03:08:13,900 --> 03:08:27,524
[SPEAKER_12]: This whole members may, it's, oh, I didn't put the full language, I apologize, but it says the four members shall constitute a quorum, oh, but a smaller number may meet and adjourn from day to day.

1968
03:08:28,645 --> 03:08:34,468
[SPEAKER_12]: No, actually, three members, if they're a part of a subcommittee, is a quorum.

1969
03:08:34,488 --> 03:08:37,870
[SPEAKER_12]: It just doesn't make any sense, and it's not in the policy manual.

1970
03:08:38,530 --> 03:08:39,351
[SPEAKER_12]: So I don't know.

1971
03:08:39,371 --> 03:08:41,452
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to repeal by Member Ruseau, seconded.

1972
03:08:41,472 --> 03:08:42,072
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a question.

1973
03:08:42,112 --> 03:08:43,553
[SPEAKER_06]: I just have a question.

1974
03:08:43,573 --> 03:08:45,534
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Kreatz, then Member McLaughlin.

1975
03:08:47,855 --> 03:08:48,995
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. Russo.

1976
03:08:49,035 --> 03:08:53,017
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think I was confused about what this meant.

1977
03:08:53,518 --> 03:08:57,720
[SPEAKER_14]: So what you're saying is that you want to

1978
03:08:59,197 --> 03:09:14,811
[SPEAKER_14]: You understand, and I understand, that four members of the committee constitute a quorum, and that a smaller group, which would be three, mean they could meet and adjourn from day to day, but that could be a violation of the open meeting law.

1979
03:09:15,091 --> 03:09:15,872
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that correct?

1980
03:09:15,892 --> 03:09:19,255
[SPEAKER_14]: Because that's a subcommittee, and a subcommittee would have to be posted.

1981
03:09:20,957 --> 03:09:23,219
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess that, I was looking for clarification.

1982
03:09:25,423 --> 03:09:26,103
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1983
03:09:26,864 --> 03:09:30,465
[SPEAKER_12]: Three members who are not part of a subcommittee actually cannot adjourn.

1984
03:09:30,485 --> 03:09:33,886
[SPEAKER_12]: Adjourn requires that there was, in fact, a meeting.

1985
03:09:33,906 --> 03:09:42,889
[SPEAKER_12]: This language doesn't exist at MASC anymore, and I suspect it is from the days before meeting law when, well, things were.

1986
03:09:43,980 --> 03:09:44,600
[SPEAKER_12]: very different.

1987
03:09:45,701 --> 03:09:55,064
[SPEAKER_12]: But there's no way for three members who are not part of a subcommittee to get together from time to time and adjourn because you can't have met.

1988
03:09:55,704 --> 03:09:59,146
[SPEAKER_12]: There's no internal consistency to the policy or sentence.

1989
03:09:59,326 --> 03:10:02,387
[SPEAKER_12]: I just noticed it when I was looking for the word quorum.

1990
03:10:03,868 --> 03:10:07,009
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's non-existent policy anywhere else.

1991
03:10:07,129 --> 03:10:12,791
[SPEAKER_12]: And I just think it makes sense that we do the hard work of cleaning up our policies that are outdated.

1992
03:10:14,088 --> 03:10:14,368
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1993
03:10:14,568 --> 03:10:15,909
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's what this, okay.

1994
03:10:15,929 --> 03:10:29,273
[SPEAKER_14]: So I understand now this was just cleaning up the policy and you know, I, the way I read it, I thought you wanted to, you know, you know, appeal that members could meet and adjourn.

1995
03:10:29,373 --> 03:10:32,294
[SPEAKER_14]: And I said, I was confused and I started reading open meeting law.

1996
03:10:32,334 --> 03:10:32,574
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1997
03:10:32,654 --> 03:10:33,054
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1998
03:10:33,094 --> 03:10:34,075
[SPEAKER_14]: So you didn't need that.

1999
03:10:34,095 --> 03:10:34,255
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

2000
03:10:34,275 --> 03:10:34,535
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2001
03:10:40,479 --> 03:10:42,159
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, thank you.

2002
03:10:42,940 --> 03:10:59,845
[SPEAKER_17]: So just to be clear, it's eliminating antiquated policy, and it's not that a smaller number can't meet, which obviously a smaller number can meet as long as we don't constitute a quorum if we want to have coffee together or something like that.

2003
03:10:59,905 --> 03:11:05,287
[SPEAKER_17]: And we're not talking about school committee business, but we can't adjourn because it's not a meeting.

2004
03:11:07,558 --> 03:11:09,459
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, that is correct.

2005
03:11:09,699 --> 03:11:24,765
[SPEAKER_12]: And in fact, specifying four members is actually problematic as well, because if there was an absence on the, if there was a vacancy on the school committee, for instance, then in fact, well, if there were six, then I guess four is still the number.

2006
03:11:24,805 --> 03:11:30,727
[SPEAKER_12]: But anyways, the open meeting law supersedes all of this stuff and goes into graphic detail.

2007
03:11:31,368 --> 03:11:32,248
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's correct.

2008
03:11:32,268 --> 03:11:35,329
[SPEAKER_12]: Is there a motion to approve?

2009
03:11:35,449 --> 03:11:36,670
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, there's a motion to approve.

2010
03:11:37,866 --> 03:11:39,207
[SPEAKER_08]: by member McLaughlin, I believe.

2011
03:11:41,389 --> 03:11:42,370
[SPEAKER_05]: No, maybe I'm wrong.

2012
03:11:42,910 --> 03:11:43,791
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't, but I will.

2013
03:11:44,352 --> 03:11:46,554
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

2014
03:11:47,394 --> 03:11:48,976
[SPEAKER_06]: And seconded by member Rousseau.

2015
03:11:49,016 --> 03:11:49,797
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

2016
03:11:50,097 --> 03:11:50,497
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

2017
03:11:50,597 --> 03:11:51,398
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

2018
03:11:52,859 --> 03:11:53,560
[SPEAKER_06]: Paper passes.

2019
03:11:53,620 --> 03:11:56,342
[SPEAKER_06]: Number six, policy BDT.

2020
03:11:56,963 --> 03:12:01,166
[SPEAKER_06]: School attorney be referred to the rules and policy subcommittee for recommended updates.

2021
03:12:01,267 --> 03:12:01,947
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Ruseau.

2022
03:12:02,207 --> 03:12:02,768
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, mayor.

2023
03:12:02,868 --> 03:12:04,469
[SPEAKER_12]: I was reading this policy and

2024
03:12:05,423 --> 03:12:09,806
[SPEAKER_12]: It does not look like it's been updated in a long time and was quite concerning.

2025
03:12:09,986 --> 03:12:23,955
[SPEAKER_12]: So just, you know, references to towns and we're not a town and a bunch of other little things that comparing it to the current policy and our policy service, it needed to be updated, so.

2026
03:12:24,875 --> 03:12:28,438
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion for approval by Member Ruseau, seconded by Member Graham.

2027
03:12:28,978 --> 03:12:29,598
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

2028
03:12:29,618 --> 03:12:29,678
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

2029
03:12:30,857 --> 03:12:32,538
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed, paper passes.

2030
03:12:32,878 --> 03:12:41,744
[SPEAKER_06]: Number seven, whereas the Medford Public Schools is committed to understanding the needs of our diverse student population and supporting the social emotional needs of our students.

2031
03:12:42,585 --> 03:12:54,693
[SPEAKER_06]: Whereas the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and the Children's Hospital Association have declared a national emergency in child and adolescent mental health.

2032
03:12:55,910 --> 03:12:56,551
[SPEAKER_06]: Whereas the U.S.

2033
03:12:56,571 --> 03:13:07,221
[SPEAKER_06]: Surgeon General issued an advisory outlining the devastating impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had and continues to have on the youth mental health crisis that existed prior to the pandemic.

2034
03:13:08,162 --> 03:13:20,154
[SPEAKER_06]: Whereas the effects of the pandemic have disproportionately affected students from racial and ethnic minorities, students with disabilities, LGBTQ plus students, and students from low income families.

2035
03:13:20,888 --> 03:13:42,815
[SPEAKER_06]: therefore be resolved that the administration will present at a regular school committee meeting no later than 3-7-2022 a detailed overview of the counseling mental health supports currently available to students at all levels in the Metropolitan Public Schools, including titles and related job descriptions for positions that provide direct one-to-one or small group counseling of students.

2036
03:13:43,905 --> 03:14:00,487
[SPEAKER_06]: The number of staff currently in each position in their full FTE at each school, current approximate hours spent in direct student contact for counseling, IEP services and non-IEP services, number of students at each school who have been referred for school-based individual or group

2037
03:14:01,394 --> 03:14:18,807
[SPEAKER_06]: small group counseling, IEP and non-IEP, approximate number of non-IEP referrals that are on a wait list for school-based counseling, number of students at each level who are referred for contracted mental health services outside of Medford Public Schools, and the number of posted positions that remain unfilled.

2038
03:14:20,168 --> 03:14:30,336
[SPEAKER_06]: Be it further resolved that the report will also outline recommended resources and staff required to meet the needs of the Medford Public School student population beginning in the

2039
03:14:30,781 --> 03:14:32,904
[SPEAKER_06]: 2022-2023 school year.

2040
03:14:33,705 --> 03:14:37,490
[SPEAKER_06]: Offered by member Sharon Hayes, member Mia Mustone, and member Jenny Graham.

2041
03:14:41,395 --> 03:14:41,776
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2042
03:14:41,876 --> 03:14:42,537
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Hays?

2043
03:14:42,797 --> 03:14:42,998
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

2044
03:14:43,919 --> 03:14:44,119
[SPEAKER_04]: So

2045
03:14:44,932 --> 03:14:57,784
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, as the resolution states, we know from many of the experts in the field of pediatric mental health and pediatric psychiatry that there is a significant mental health crisis.

2046
03:14:57,844 --> 03:14:59,626
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've talked about this at meetings before.

2047
03:15:00,346 --> 03:15:04,190
[SPEAKER_04]: And so this was really an effort as we move into the budget season.

2048
03:15:04,791 --> 03:15:11,781
[SPEAKER_04]: to make sure that we're kind of all starting on the same page as to what the supports are that we already have at Bedford public schools.

2049
03:15:12,442 --> 03:15:18,010
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the titles I think are, you know, we started to talk about it at one meeting I think prior to before I joined.

2050
03:15:19,080 --> 03:15:34,070
[SPEAKER_04]: and understanding what the titles are and where the direct services to students come from, and how they're accessing those services, how many of them are accessing them, just so that we can begin to have, or have a more in-depth conversation about what our needs are.

2051
03:15:35,631 --> 03:15:37,873
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was the purpose of this resolution.

2052
03:15:38,033 --> 03:15:40,154
[SPEAKER_06]: Great, so motion for approval by Member Hays.

2053
03:15:40,314 --> 03:15:41,295
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a question.

2054
03:15:41,515 --> 03:15:42,636
[SPEAKER_06]: Member McLaughlin.

2055
03:15:43,076 --> 03:15:45,318
[SPEAKER_17]: I think, did Member Creutz, were you before me?

2056
03:15:45,358 --> 03:15:45,618
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry.

2057
03:15:46,755 --> 03:15:48,236
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Kreatz, do you have a question as well?

2058
03:15:48,436 --> 03:15:49,256
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, no.

2059
03:15:49,736 --> 03:15:50,217
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, okay.

2060
03:15:50,357 --> 03:15:51,717
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry.

2061
03:15:52,478 --> 03:15:57,180
[SPEAKER_17]: I think this is great and it's sorely needed for sure.

2062
03:15:57,200 --> 03:16:00,942
[SPEAKER_17]: I just have some questions on some of the comments.

2063
03:16:01,062 --> 03:16:10,467
[SPEAKER_17]: And one is that I'm curious about on the bottom of page six, where it's approximate number of non-IEP referrals that are on a wait list for school-based counseling.

2064
03:16:10,527 --> 03:16:15,129
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm wondering what the differentiation is there, if you can explain that a little bit.

2065
03:16:16,610 --> 03:16:29,021
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so the reason behind that was I know that as a former special ed teacher myself, I know that students who have it on their service grid are going to get it no matter what.

2066
03:16:29,341 --> 03:16:38,209
[SPEAKER_04]: So this question was, do we have enough really supports to cover students who don't necessarily have that legal obligation of having it on their IEP grid?

2067
03:16:40,611 --> 03:16:41,712
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, thank you.

2068
03:16:42,946 --> 03:17:02,973
[SPEAKER_17]: And then I just, again, a process question, and I know, again, through the Chair, that Member Hays may not have, well, may not have been at the meeting, certainly, when the process was, or the policy was created around requesting reports from administration, and I just wanted to know if that

2069
03:17:04,552 --> 03:17:14,261
[SPEAKER_17]: was a process that need to be followed as we're talking about what the, I think this is needed, don't get me wrong, but just what the demands are on the staff and the administration.

2070
03:17:14,522 --> 03:17:20,768
[SPEAKER_17]: And I thought there was a whole process of vetting that we were going through for requesting reports.

2071
03:17:27,320 --> 03:17:27,840
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Graham?

2072
03:17:28,221 --> 03:17:45,031
[SPEAKER_15]: I think the first step in the process is for the member to lay out what the request is, which this does, and for us to take a vote that we agree that this is something worthy of spending time on, which I think is what we would do if we voted on this resolution.

2073
03:17:45,052 --> 03:17:56,539
[SPEAKER_15]: And then if the superintendent has any amendments to offer now or needs to come back to us at another point in time, that's the next step in the process, but it cannot happen until we take this vote, right?

2074
03:17:59,433 --> 03:18:05,518
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm fine with taking a vote for this.

2075
03:18:05,678 --> 03:18:07,900
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not sure that that's what the policy is.

2076
03:18:07,940 --> 03:18:17,848
[SPEAKER_17]: And again, if we're being stickless for policy, I just want to make sure that we're following it just because I don't want to have some people follow and other people not, and obviously in the interest of fairness.

2077
03:18:17,868 --> 03:18:18,568
[SPEAKER_17]: So I don't know.

2078
03:18:18,588 --> 03:18:22,852
[SPEAKER_17]: I thought, I think you're right that I'm happy to vote on this tonight and,

2079
03:18:23,865 --> 03:18:34,714
[SPEAKER_17]: the superintendent and the administrative team can come back on a time that's reasonable to get the report to us, if that's amenable to the members who are offering this.

2080
03:18:35,175 --> 03:18:43,642
[SPEAKER_17]: And I guess I would just have us make sure that we're checking the policy as a group so that we know what the process actually is.

2081
03:18:43,682 --> 03:18:44,043
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

2082
03:18:44,543 --> 03:18:44,803
[SPEAKER_12]: Mayor.

2083
03:18:45,884 --> 03:18:46,425
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Ruseau.

2084
03:18:47,351 --> 03:19:13,756
[SPEAKER_12]: Member McLaughlin is correct that the procedure policy, which are good definitions for which word to use and when, does say that everything is in here is part of what is expected, but I'll just say policy says that the superintendent would take this information back and make a determination of effort, and then we would vote

2085
03:19:14,462 --> 03:19:35,973
[SPEAKER_12]: If after hearing that, whether to fulfill the request, the procedure policy also does say that the superintendent has the freedom to just fill it, fulfill the request if it turns out that, you know, you go back and it's a half an hour of work and you're like, well, it'll take more time to put it on the agenda and come back in two weeks and get us to approve it.

2086
03:19:37,614 --> 03:19:39,135
[SPEAKER_12]: So that is what it says.

2087
03:19:40,075 --> 03:19:43,197
[SPEAKER_12]: So, I mean, there's nothing wrong with this as written other than

2088
03:19:44,263 --> 03:19:51,830
[SPEAKER_12]: If the superintendent goes back and says, this is going to take a person, you know, a week of work, then that shouldn't happen.

2089
03:19:52,190 --> 03:19:54,412
[SPEAKER_12]: We should vote once we know that.

2090
03:19:57,335 --> 03:19:59,377
[SPEAKER_12]: Which I mean, obviously this sounds rather important.

2091
03:19:59,417 --> 03:20:01,479
[SPEAKER_12]: So I certainly suggest we would vote for it.

2092
03:20:01,619 --> 03:20:04,942
[SPEAKER_12]: But if it's, if it turns out that this is just a huge labor cost.

2093
03:20:07,004 --> 03:20:08,906
[SPEAKER_13]: Could I ask Ms.

2094
03:20:08,947 --> 03:20:18,097
[SPEAKER_13]: Bowen just to come forward where this particular report falls directly under her department.

2095
03:20:18,697 --> 03:20:28,348
[SPEAKER_13]: And so the proposed deadline is March 7th, and I'd just like you to speak to that if you can.

2096
03:20:33,018 --> 03:20:45,311
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's probably doable, but I think we do need to look into, speaking to Stacey Shulman as well, just how long it will take to gather this information.

2097
03:20:45,331 --> 03:20:51,337
[SPEAKER_02]: I do anticipate we could probably get it by mid-March, if that's agreeable.

2098
03:20:55,808 --> 03:21:09,863
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion for approval by Member Hays, seconded by Member Mustone, as amended by Member Graham to mid-March.

2099
03:21:10,804 --> 03:21:11,064
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

2100
03:21:12,005 --> 03:21:12,646
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

2101
03:21:13,507 --> 03:21:13,627
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

2102
03:21:13,787 --> 03:21:14,548
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

2103
03:21:14,728 --> 03:21:15,409
[SPEAKER_06]: Paper passes.

2104
03:21:16,678 --> 03:21:41,348
[SPEAKER_06]: whereas the Medford School Committee has contemplated the creation and deployment of a vision committee to ascertain and articulate the Medford community's priorities and vision for Medford High School since 2019, and whereas Medford High School is a comprehensive high school serving approximately 1,300 young adults of the Medford community charged with providing them with an engaging, well-rounded, and culminating educational experience,

2105
03:21:42,217 --> 03:21:53,663
[SPEAKER_06]: of their pre-K to 12 plus academic careers, and therefore serves as a flagship educational institution in which all members of the Medford community have a vested interest in its continuous improvement as a school.

2106
03:21:53,683 --> 03:22:04,629
[SPEAKER_06]: And whereas the establishment of the Medford High School Vision Committee has been delayed due to ongoing challenges of COVID-19 pandemic, and whereas the Medford School Committee recognizes that the deterioration

2107
03:22:05,234 --> 03:22:18,459
[SPEAKER_06]: infrastructure of the current Medford High School demands urgent and bold action to ensure that current and future MHS students attend school in a building that is reflective of the Medford community's deep and abiding commitment to education.

2108
03:22:18,479 --> 03:22:29,403
[SPEAKER_06]: And whereas the students of Medford High School are entitled to a 21st century education that is empowered through the utilization of best in class instructional technology and innovative practices,

2109
03:22:30,162 --> 03:22:48,545
[SPEAKER_06]: Whereas the Medford public schools are wholly committed to ensuring an equitable and inclusive process by which community representatives can deliberate over how to develop a vision that will ensure a flagship school that leaves Medford High School graduates poised for post-secondary life defined by happiness, success, and fulfillment.

2110
03:22:49,385 --> 03:22:59,467
[SPEAKER_06]: And whereas effective January 28th, 2022, the Massachusetts School Building Authority will open both the core program and accelerated repair program statement of interest application windows

2111
03:23:00,220 --> 03:23:18,949
[SPEAKER_06]: Therefore, be it resolved that the superintendent of schools utilizing an inclusive and equitable process by which to formulate a recommendation will present to the Medford School Committee on March 21, 2022, a recommended course of action with respect to the MSBA sanctioned repair, rehabilitation, and rebuild process.

2112
03:23:20,269 --> 03:23:21,710
[SPEAKER_06]: Be it further resolved that

2113
03:23:22,204 --> 03:23:46,053
[SPEAKER_06]: As part of the superintendent's presentation, the central administration will report on the deliberative process by which the recommendation to pursue either both or neither of the MSBA programs was established, including the stakeholders who were consulted, the school construction experts who were consulted in the consensus, if any, about the strategic implications for the recommended course of action that developed through the process.

2114
03:23:47,874 --> 03:24:02,578
[SPEAKER_06]: It further resolved that upon the superintendent's recommendation, the Medford School Committee would convene pursuant to school committee policy, BDF, a flagship committee, formerly called the Medford High School Vision Committee, comprised of representative stakeholders to deliberate

2115
03:24:03,066 --> 03:24:22,731
[SPEAKER_06]: deliberate over and make formal recommendations to the Medford School Committee about the organizing principles and core values that should be reflected in the district's flagship school, regardless of whether the ultimate resolution to the MSBA application process is a new refurbished or extensively repaired Medford High School and be resolved

2116
03:24:23,502 --> 03:24:29,127
[SPEAKER_06]: that the flagship committee will convene to begin this work no later than April 4th, 2022, and shall make progress.

2117
03:24:29,747 --> 03:24:36,413
[SPEAKER_06]: Reports to the Medford School Committee on a monthly basis for the duration of the term established when the flagship committee is formed.

2118
03:24:37,074 --> 03:24:41,978
[SPEAKER_06]: Offered by myself, Mayor Breanna Lungo-Koehn, Member Paul Rousseau, and Member Jenny Graham.

2119
03:24:44,551 --> 03:24:47,214
[SPEAKER_06]: If I may, I'll speak briefly from the chair.

2120
03:24:47,254 --> 03:24:49,256
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this resolution speaks for itself.

2121
03:24:49,316 --> 03:24:52,098
[SPEAKER_06]: We're putting a large task on the administration.

2122
03:24:52,799 --> 03:24:54,821
[SPEAKER_06]: We are here to help and discuss.

2123
03:24:54,961 --> 03:25:02,989
[SPEAKER_06]: We are putting a committee together that we are just renaming a bit and hopefully get that work started on April 4th, 2022.

2124
03:25:03,049 --> 03:25:06,993
[SPEAKER_06]: This is something that we, you know, we want everybody to support.

2125
03:25:07,013 --> 03:25:09,275
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to ask eventually when we submit

2126
03:25:10,023 --> 03:25:29,078
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to ask the City Council to also support this action and we hope we have a unanimous collaborative front to stop the process and be able to obtain an MSBA loan for our future for the many reasons as stated in the resolution that I just outlined.

2127
03:25:29,338 --> 03:25:34,322
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm not sure if Member Graham or Member Ruseau have anything else to add besides a motion for approval.

2128
03:25:34,342 --> 03:25:36,383
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a question if I may.

2129
03:25:36,483 --> 03:25:37,684
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a question also.

2130
03:25:39,344 --> 03:25:40,686
[SPEAKER_06]: McLaughlin, then member Kreatz.

2131
03:25:41,828 --> 03:25:42,169
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

2132
03:25:43,437 --> 03:25:54,444
[SPEAKER_17]: So I know that this has been sort of, especially the last portion of this resolution was a sore point in the community.

2133
03:25:55,325 --> 03:26:12,017
[SPEAKER_17]: And I want to know if there's going to be some clarification around how we are building the flagship committee with, I know it says comprised of representative stakeholders, and I want to know how that's being defined.

2134
03:26:12,717 --> 03:26:22,621
[SPEAKER_17]: and how we're going to ensure that members of the community feel included in the process, because I know that that was a real issue last time.

2135
03:26:22,641 --> 03:26:25,882
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm wondering if someone could speak to that a little bit, please.

2136
03:26:26,322 --> 03:26:27,003
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Graham?

2137
03:26:27,883 --> 03:26:28,143
[SPEAKER_15]: Sure.

2138
03:26:29,464 --> 03:26:38,247
[SPEAKER_15]: So this is written to align with our policy, which BDF is our policy around standing up

2139
03:26:38,902 --> 03:26:39,862
[SPEAKER_15]: advisory committees.

2140
03:26:40,082 --> 03:26:52,747
[SPEAKER_15]: And so what that policy says, if you remember from the Missittuck renewing, is that this committee will decide the scope, the charge, the body, and how the body is selected.

2141
03:26:52,807 --> 03:26:56,828
[SPEAKER_15]: So that is work we will have to do between now and April 4th.

2142
03:26:57,688 --> 03:26:59,609
[SPEAKER_15]: in order for them to be able to reconvene.

2143
03:26:59,709 --> 03:27:01,630
[SPEAKER_15]: So to be able to convene for the first time.

2144
03:27:01,710 --> 03:27:05,451
[SPEAKER_15]: So that work is on us according to our policies.

2145
03:27:06,192 --> 03:27:08,633
[SPEAKER_15]: All this is saying is that we will do that.

2146
03:27:09,213 --> 03:27:16,736
[SPEAKER_15]: And so the question of like, how will it be formed is a question for us when we meet in a committee of the whole to form that committee.

2147
03:27:19,197 --> 03:27:19,297
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

2148
03:27:20,337 --> 03:27:20,617
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

2149
03:27:20,637 --> 03:27:23,279
[SPEAKER_17]: So I guess, so are we, okay.

2150
03:27:23,719 --> 03:27:34,305
[SPEAKER_17]: So we can have a conversation about that in the committee of the whole, but there's nothing in the policy that discusses or mentions how the advisory committees are built in terms of, I mean, I just, correct.

2151
03:27:34,525 --> 03:27:34,705
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

2152
03:27:34,905 --> 03:27:47,311
[SPEAKER_17]: Cause I'm seeing our seven, our demographic of our seven members and it's concerning and I want to make sure that we're being really thoughtful about how we are creating the rules around how the advisory committee is built.

2153
03:27:47,832 --> 03:27:48,172
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

2154
03:27:50,874 --> 03:27:55,777
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, I just wanted, I had a question and just maybe need some clarification.

2155
03:27:56,257 --> 03:28:12,369
[SPEAKER_14]: So is this flagship committee doing the research and making the recommendation whether it's going to be a new school, a refurbished high school, or is this committee deciding on the educational direction that we're taking?

2156
03:28:12,749 --> 03:28:16,331
[SPEAKER_14]: I just wasn't sure because of the MSBA information that was in there.

2157
03:28:17,532 --> 03:28:18,793
[SPEAKER_14]: a lot of the other goals.

2158
03:28:19,033 --> 03:28:20,635
[SPEAKER_14]: If somebody could clarify that, thank you.

2159
03:28:21,376 --> 03:28:27,381
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Graham, so will the committee decide that no?

2160
03:28:30,163 --> 03:28:34,347
[SPEAKER_15]: That ideally would not be the purpose of the committee because we need

2161
03:28:34,793 --> 03:28:39,897
[SPEAKER_15]: the experts and the people with money at MSBA to do that for us.

2162
03:28:40,738 --> 03:28:56,270
[SPEAKER_15]: So the goal is to make sure that we do not miss the window of the MSBA statement of interest application process and allow that work that the superintendent would do under this directive to help us inform the scope

2163
03:28:57,027 --> 03:29:00,608
[SPEAKER_15]: of those next steps for the flagship committee to undertake.

2164
03:29:00,708 --> 03:29:08,550
[SPEAKER_15]: And that should help us, because if you remember back when we were talking about this originally, there was no scope yet written.

2165
03:29:08,790 --> 03:29:12,711
[SPEAKER_15]: So we picked a bunch of people, but we didn't tell them what the scope of their work was.

2166
03:29:12,811 --> 03:29:17,352
[SPEAKER_15]: And everyone had a different idea of what they were going to do when they came to the first meeting.

2167
03:29:17,452 --> 03:29:21,733
[SPEAKER_15]: So we need to do a good job of deciding what that scope is for them.

2168
03:29:22,718 --> 03:29:46,772
[SPEAKER_15]: when we formed the committee, but the goal is to let the MSBA process inform us and lead that in a productive direction rather than to have a committee that doesn't have a clear charge or has a charge that's in the worst case in conflict with what we need to do to stay on the MSBA timeline and engage with them as quickly as possible.

2169
03:29:47,342 --> 03:29:59,326
[SPEAKER_15]: So all of that, that's sort of why the timing is MSBA first and then flagship committee second, so that we can have a better idea and understanding of the scope when we get together to form that committee.

2170
03:30:00,006 --> 03:30:00,326
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

2171
03:30:00,387 --> 03:30:05,288
[SPEAKER_14]: So the committee will receive like the MSBA statement of interest that was submitted.

2172
03:30:05,348 --> 03:30:10,290
[SPEAKER_14]: So they'll know what they're looking at and it's still going to take us probably another

2173
03:30:10,840 --> 03:30:14,803
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, till the end of the year for us to hear back on whether we're going to get the MSDA.

2174
03:30:14,903 --> 03:30:15,324
[SPEAKER_14]: Correct.

2175
03:30:15,504 --> 03:30:15,764
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

2176
03:30:16,105 --> 03:30:16,445
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

2177
03:30:16,465 --> 03:30:18,807
[SPEAKER_14]: So I thank you for the clarification.

2178
03:30:19,067 --> 03:30:19,307
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

2179
03:30:21,169 --> 03:30:21,549
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

2180
03:30:21,809 --> 03:30:22,970
