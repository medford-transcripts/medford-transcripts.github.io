    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=131.146s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=132.587s">Today</a>  is January 24th, which the United Nations deemed in 2018 as the International Day of Education. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=143.238s">The</a>  declaration called for free and compulsory elementary education to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education for all by 2030. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=152.584s">The</a>  2022 theme is changing course, transforming education. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=162.625s">The</a>  United Nations resolution highlighted the importance of the fundamental right for everyone to education, to have an education, to help to build a more sustainable, inclusive, and peaceful world. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=178.675s">I'd</a>  like to share this evening on behalf of our community partner, Project Bread. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=184.338s">They</a>  have asked us to encourage our families to apply for critical SNAP benefits. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=191.377s">There</a>  have been policy changes made to SNAP, and we hope that our families will take the time to check it out at gettingsnap.org. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=202.284s">SNAP</a>  helps households meet nutritional and dietary needs, enables households to purchase food that is healthy and culturally appropriate, and supports low-wage households. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=219.925s">On</a>  a different note, I would like to add a special congratulations and share a very special happy birthday to Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=229.853s">Ginny</a>  Eugenia Christopoulos, who's the longtime school lunch mother at the Brooks Elementary School. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=238.701s">She</a>  celebrated her 90th birthday last week on January 19th. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=246.216s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=246.456s">Jenny,</a>  as she is affectionately called, has the energy of an elementary age student. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=253.179s">And</a>  she was a bright light and busy bee at the Brooks Elementary School. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=258.862s">She</a>  is a beloved member of the school community, and we appreciate her willingness to support our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=265.785s">So</a>  happy birthday, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=266.986s">Jenny.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=267.286s">90</a>  is a wonderful accomplishment. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=272.065s">I'd</a>  like to remind everyone to please note that this Wednesday, January 26th, that we'll be hosting a Zoom monthly support meeting for parents and caregivers with children dealing with autism spectrum disorder, ASD, and related disorders from 6.30 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=292.597s">to</a>  7.30 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=292.937s">this</a>  Wednesday evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=299.648s">Also</a>  on Wednesday, I'd like to thank in advance we have another vaccination clinic happening this Wednesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=306.576s">I</a>  want to thank Nurse Avery and all of the medical staff that have been working tirelessly in collaboration with our Board of Health partners. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=317.585s">and</a>  Mr. Murphy, who will also be providing a more detailed COVID-19 update shortly. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=322.988s">But</a>  I wanted to remind everyone that the vaccine clinic that's gonna be taking place this Wednesday will be from 12.30 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=330.651s">until</a>  6 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=334.577s">Not</a>  only is the COVID-19 vaccine available, but also the flu shot vaccine. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=340.761s">So</a>  we are now offering two types of shots, the COVID shot and the flu vaccine shot. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=350.408s">While</a>  the COVID vaccines are limited to staff and students only, the flu vaccines are state supplied and available for anyone, including uninsured adults. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=364.017s">My</a>  Friday message included the registration links, and they are located on the school blog as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=372.822s">This</a>  Thursday, January 27th, the Medford Family Network will be presenting a Zoom meeting with the topic, Keeping Kids Safe on the Internet. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=385.009s">This</a>  is a training for parents and caregivers of children eight years old and younger. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=391.953s">It</a>  will be held from 730 to 830 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=396.035s">Please</a>  register with the Medford Family Network. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=399.817s">Also,</a>  the Medford Family Network is seeking donations of diapers, sizes five and six, as well as wipes. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=410.142s">If</a>  you are able to assist, please call Medford Family Network at 781-393-2106. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=422.084s">So</a>  after a three-week shutdown due to COVID-19 concerns, I'm happy to report that our Mustang athletes are back on the court, which includes our middle school basketball teams, and they are back on the ice as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=438.192s">Additionally,</a>  our gymnastics team and indoor track team have returned to competition. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=444.935s">So</a>  I'd like to wish good luck to all of our winter sports teams. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=450.397s">I</a>  also want to share the good news that our new beautiful Charlotte and William Bloomberg Medford Public Library is open and is busy scheduling all types of in-person and Zoom events for all ages. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=466.407s">They</a>  just announced the 2022 teen reading challenge for students in grades six through 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=475.214s">For</a>  students who might be interested, please contact Nicole at the library at 781-475-5735. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=486.723s">Another</a>  important update, Medford High School, regarding our MSBA application deadline update, <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=497.6s">So</a>  the MSBA, Massachusetts School Building Authority and Central Administration, we will be presenting a report to you later this evening for the application window with MSBA for the peer projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=512.549s">The</a>  application window opens this Friday, January 28, 2022. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=520.654s">and</a>  the administration plans to consider possible statements of interest, which we refer to as an SRI, about two programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=531.298s">There</a>  is the Accelerated Repair Program, ARP, which involves repairing potentially specific sections of schools, and the CORE program, which involves building a completely new school. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=547.945s">The</a>  respective deadlines are March 25th and April 29th. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=553.948s">This</a>  important work will require the collaboration and support of many stakeholders in order to be successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=561.092s">A</a>  report again later this evening will be presented to the entire body. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=567.553s">In</a>  closing, I would like to say that Chinese New Year 2022, also called the Lunar New Year in the Spring Festival, begins Tuesday, February 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=583.122s">It</a>  is the year of the tiger, and those born during this year are predicted to be brave, competitive, unpredictable, and confident. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=594.952s">We</a>  express our wishes of good health and happiness to all of our Asian families and friends who celebrate the 16-day festival. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=604.835s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=606.595s">Thank</a>  you, Dr. Edward-Vincent. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=609.056s">Number</a>  two, we have an introduction to the equity process. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=612.357s">The</a>  equity process, a firm hired to conduct the equity audit of Medford Public Schools will present the scope of work for Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=621.202s">Cindy</a>  Weeks Bradley, CEO of the Equity Process, and Superintendent of Schools, Dr. Maurice-Edouard-Vincent.</p>

<a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=778.31s">What</a>  it really looks like is us just doing a lot of work, so combing through tons and tons of policies and procedures and practices and talking to people, and that's to facilitate discussions and the focus groups and surveys and really checking to see <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=795.082s">which</a>  patterns emerge, what is already there, what isn't there, how can we enhance? <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=800.087s">That's</a>  us just doing the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=803.07s">But</a>  what it does not look like is the next slide, please, Peter. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=808.558s">Oh,</a>  sorry, this is still what it looks like. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=811.8s">So</a>  I took a look at this report from Stanford University, written in April 2021. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=816.483s">And</a>  it really gets into like the pieces of the audit that looks at diversity and leadership, community engagement, HR policies, where's where I will be right now, engaging like the culture of the community and not just the school, as well as learning and development. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=834.114s">Thank</a>  you, Peter. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=834.754s">Next</a>  slide, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=837.023s">Here's</a>  the one where it does not look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=839.927s">This</a>  is quite interesting because usually once reports are done, people will ask a lot of questions like where's this, where's that, where's the next, where's the third. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=847.997s">It</a>  is not a scientific method by any means, so I don't want you to believe that I'm coming in here and <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=854.285s">I'm</a>  going to do this scientific experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=856.467s">That's</a>  not what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=857.367s">It's</a>  really looking at your data very closely and seeing what matters to the city of Medford, the public of Medford, the community of Medford and the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=867.735s">So</a>  it's tying all those pieces together. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=870.537s">We</a>  will not have a research topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=872.919s">That's</a>  why it's not a scientific experiment because we have our own expertise in this area, but we're not researching a specific topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=880.744s">You</a>  will not have a hypothesis. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=882.445s">That's</a>  not cool at all for this kind of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=884.865s">What</a>  we're doing is really allowing the data to write the script or the narrative. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=889.207s">So</a>  it's what your data shows us. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=891.487s">And</a>  there is no test or experiment. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=893.388s">It</a>  is what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=894.088s">This</a>  is what your data says. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=895.789s">Here's</a>  the information, and here are our recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=899.13s">Next</a>  slide, please, Frida. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=903.051s">simply</a>  stated, how do we do all this? <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=905.092s">We</a>  aim first to get to know everyone that we come in contact with. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=909.013s">There'll</a>  be an opportunity for school committee members if you are interested to volunteer and do one-on-one interviews. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=914.654s">You</a>  don't have to do them, but I feel that your voice is utterly important, so you'll have that opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=920.196s">We</a>  will interview folks in HR and the leadership team, and we'll interview Maurice, <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=926.217s">We'll</a>  also give an opportunity for unsolicited information to be included. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=930.918s">When</a>  we do audits, people tend to email me all sorts of stuff, so we take that into consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=938.18s">We</a>  look at the implicit bias tools that you're currently using and think, are there any that we should be using? <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=944.121s">Things</a>  like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=944.821s">Handbook,</a>  right at the bottom you'll see handbook, employee handbook, union handbook. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=949.53s">content</a>  level curriculum, behavioral policies. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=953.051s">How</a>  does our work impact children and what is the relationship that we have with kids every day? <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=958.753s">Not</a>  just face-to-face relationships, but also on paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=964.435s">Next</a>  slide, please, Peter. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=968.092s">And</a>  this is probably, okay, I'll be, I'm telling you, I'm a little biased right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=971.713s">This</a>  is my favorite part, where I ask this question, what might a great experience look like for all students in Medford and not just some? <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=979.196s">Because</a>  we know that there are some students that are doing really, really well and some students that are not doing well, but my job is to figure out how can we all come together and help all students do well? <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=990.099s">You</a>  don't have to answer that question, but food for thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=993.54s">And</a>  how do we ensure, because it is our responsibility as well, including mine, even though I'm not a resident of Medford, how do we ensure and embrace the notion of students in minority populations? <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1004.507s">So</a>  once again, I'm not just here for race, I'm here for students in all minority populations. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1010.79s">So</a>  I put a little caveat there, BIPOCs, L, students with disability, LGBTQIA++, students from varied ethnicities and religions outside of the dominant culture. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1022.657s">and</a>  many others. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1023.298s">So</a>  how can we ensure that they feel safe and actualize their vision of success too? <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1029.384s">I'm</a>  an immigrant. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1030.185s">I</a>  come from Barbados. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1031.206s">I</a>  came here when I was five. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1032.988s">America</a>  is so vastly different from Barbados. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1035.13s">I</a>  had all my education here. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1036.912s">UMass</a>  Boston, my bachelor's degree, my master's from Simmons College, which is now Simmons University. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1042.738s">and</a>  lots of, you know, professional development going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1046.299s">One</a>  thing I can tell you about Barbados is this little, if you don't know, it's a tiny, tiny, itsy bitsy country with a hundred percent literacy. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1053.442s">So</a>  it baffles me. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1054.782s">How</a>  does grand America not have a hundred percent literacy? <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1058.764s">How</a>  do we have homelessness? <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1060.084s">How</a>  do we not support one another? <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1061.665s">So</a>  it's just ingrained within me to do this work. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1065.486s">And</a>  I really want to make sure that students can have the choice when they graduate from high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1071.388s">So</a>  it's not us telling you, well, you're going to go to college, you're going to do a trade or I don't know, you're going to be a vagrant on the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1077.834s">That's</a>  not our job. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1078.975s">Our</a>  job is to give them the best so that they can have choices. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1082.258s">And</a>  that's critically why I'm here today. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1085.3s">And</a>  I will end with this last slide, please, Peter. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1089.504s">Do</a>  you have any questions that I can answer for you? <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1094.588s">Thank</a>  you, Peter.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1097.851s">Yes,</a>  Paul. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1099.295s">And</a>  there are so thank you thank you for the presentation.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1103.139s">Thank</a>  you for the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1105.161s">So</a>  I certainly understand my HR is sort of the first thing here is there a plan to keep coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1115.83s">I</a>  mean, HR isn't the whole shebang. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1119.191s">I</a>  get that it's sort of like a critical step, because it's like how we get our people, or even how we treat our people. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1128.834s">There's</a>  a lot about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1129.894s">But</a>  is it too soon, having not done this yet for HR, to know what the next step is, or have you been engaged for a next step?</p>

    <p>[Weeks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1140.675s">So</a>  the next steps is truly up to, I just say, Maurice, I don't know what your technical terms are, so forgive me not being disrespectful. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1149.042s">But</a>  the next steps is for you and her to have a conversation to see how deep you want to go with the equity audit. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1154.987s">But</a>  since it's such a large district, when her and I talked, we thought it would be best to start in pieces. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1160.812s">And</a>  HR was the first place to start, because we don't have the right people, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1165.436s">in</a>  front of students and how do we begin to move the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1168.537s">And</a>  it's really about 21st century learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1170.758s">So</a>  we're not saying like, Oh, it's so bad right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1173.659s">What</a>  we're saying is what does the future need for our students to be successful? <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1178.261s">And</a>  is it currently here right now? <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1180.002s">And</a>  if it's not, what do we need to do to ensure that it's here?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1183.904s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1184.424s">You're</a>  welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1189.526s">Thank</a>  you so much for the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1191.727s">Oh,</a>  member of Graham.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1193.363s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1193.803s">Um,</a>  I had a couple of questions as, as I was looking through this. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1198.905s">So</a>  when you say this, the scope of this initial piece is HR, can you give us a sense of what that means to you in terms of the things and systems and types of procedures that you are going to be looking at in this phase?</p>

    <p>[Weeks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1219.672s">Thank</a>  you for that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1221.193s">I</a>  want to tell you what it means to me is absolutely nothing because I come in with a blind eye. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1225.797s">So</a>  however you have defined human resources in Medford, that's where I begin. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1231.442s">So</a>  it's not my definition of human resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1234.184s">It's</a>  your definition of human resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1236.606s">We</a>  begin to look at policies and practices and procedures. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1239.929s">When</a>  I say policies, I mean, we're looking at school committee policies. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1243.052s">We're</a>  looking at HR policies. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1244.798s">We're</a>  looking at the overall school policies. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1246.7s">We're</a>  looking at handbooks for every single school. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1249.082s">We're</a>  looking at like, how do you do your hiring and retention? <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1252.985s">We're</a>  looking at who has left when it comes to people in the minority population. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1259.01s">Why</a>  haven't you retained them or how have you retained them? <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1261.912s">So</a>  those are the things we begin to look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1263.714s">We</a>  look at the mission and the vision of the school, but we also look at the mission and the vision for <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1268.838s">human</a>  resources as a whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1271.081s">So</a>  there are a lot of pieces that we tend to look for, and we look at those in certain ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1275.506s">We</a>  look through the papers, what you have to present to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1279.17s">We</a>  also ask certain questions when we begin to do facilitated discussions, like focus groups and interviews. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1285.978s">Did</a>  that answer the question?</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1288.701s">Sort</a>  of. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1290.381s">So</a>  I think the question maybe is for Dr. Edward-Vincent, how has HR been defined here in Medford Public Schools for this equity audit to be completed? <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1300.794s">Like</a>  what is the definition we're working against?</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1304.518s">So</a>  right now, from an HR perspective, <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1310.018s">One</a>  of the challenges we face here in Medford is that it is very difficult to recruit and retain diverse candidates. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1320.988s">So</a>  that is kind of like one of the elephants in the room that we are very, very aware of. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1327.333s">So</a>  we are looking at the current practices of where are we finding candidates, where are we recruiting them from, coming up with additional potential partners that can help us diversify our staffing when there are, you know, open positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1345.406s">And</a>  the retention piece, which was mentioned earlier, that we have hired some BIPOC candidates or candidates of color and <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1354.292s">they</a>  may stay one year or two years and then they choose not to stay. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1359.998s">So</a>  that is a question, another opportunity becomes available and they take that opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1366.786s">So</a>  trying to unpack like the why is there, is there something that we're not aware of that <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1375.415s">could</a>  make Medford less attractive than what we and so if that is the case what do we need to do as a district to make it more attractive and try to think about further bringing greater diversity to the school system and so as a starting point it's the reason us <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1395.919s">you</a>  know, this person isn't doing this thing in human resources, but it's more like, what are we doing? <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1401.522s">And</a>  then what else could we be doing? <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1403.763s">And</a>  presenting us with other opportunities to be able to better recruit and retain. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1410.806s">We</a>  do have two other groups that we're trying to work with, but we still haven't been able to get the traction yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1418.33s">So</a>  we're trying, but we're just not getting <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1423.472s">the</a>  traction that we're hoping to get. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1425.073s">So</a>  by having the audit start in human resources and also in light of the pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1433.919s">And</a>  again, we just were in the process on the tail end now of this surge that we just were dealing with. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1440.523s">We</a>  were like, where can we start? <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1444.225s">and</a>  not have an impact of going in and out of all of the classroom, in and out of all of the schools right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1450.609s">So</a>  hoping to do this first phase, get a really strong piece of data and information to help us move forward as a district. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1459.034s">So</a>  that was the thinking and the strategy behind starting with human resources and looking at recruitment and retention strategies.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1472.262s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1473.423s">That</a>  helps. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1474.124s">And</a>  I guess the other question I had is when you say we, who do you mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1479.428s">And</a>  was the racial equity task force involved in the like scope selection here, or is this something that the administration has decided?</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1487.874s">So</a>  this, the racial equity task force has <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1493.543s">weighed</a>  in and expressed their concern and their support of us doing an equity audit. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1499.386s">This</a>  particular focus right now in terms of mid-pandemic and wanting to start the work, the administration made the final decision with the equity process to start here right now, even though it's still mid-pandemic, but start the work instead of saying we have to wait another year to start again because <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1523.135s">We</a>  have to start somewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1524.276s">We</a>  can't pretend that the work doesn't need to happen.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1528.339s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1529.08s">And</a>  can you just tell us how long you expect this work to take in this first phase?</p>

    <p>[Weeks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1533.263s">Yeah,</a>  so in the first phase, I'm expecting we're going to start this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1538.907s">Yeah,</a>  we're going to start this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1540.288s">Wow.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1541.444s">Excuse</a>  me, I'm going through some stuff personally. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1543.306s">My</a>  father, my husband's mom passed away. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1545.448s">So</a>  we're going to start this week and we expect to be done by May. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1550.012s">So</a>  by May, we will have a report for you at the minute maximum. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1554.216s">It</a>  may be even sooner depending upon the documents. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1557.159s">And</a>  I just want to preface that, though that may be the case for Medford, when we go in, we may find more than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1564.866s">We'll</a>  be looking at everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1567.002s">and</a>  maybe how do we support our teachers or staff who have disabilities? <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1571.705s">That</a>  may be a recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1573.367s">So</a>  it will not just be a recommendation on that alone. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1576.769s">You</a>  will have that information, but it is really looking at what is best for students. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1581.292s">And</a>  we know that diversity as a whole is best for students, but that is the focal point.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1586.977s">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1587.457s">Very</a>  sorry for your loss. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1588.638s">Thanks</a>  for the presentation.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1590.219s">Sorry,</a>  I couldn't remember. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1591.52s">It's</a>  okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1592.641s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1594.322s">Member</a>  Ruseau?</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1596.693s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1597.634s">Member</a>  Graham had asked a question that made me remember my other question. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1602.258s">Will</a>  we get your recommendations even if some of them are not the most solvable? <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1615.028s">Like,</a>  if you come back and say, we can hire all of the <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1620.459s">We</a>  can hire candidates that are of all kinds of diverse backgrounds. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1626.263s">They're</a>  going to move here from wherever they went to college and they're going to go to the W's and get a 25% pay raise. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1633.128s">I</a>  want to know, will you tell us if the problem, one of the major problems is that our pay is, I'm just making numbers up, is 10 or 15% too low. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1643.095s">You</a>  can do all you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1643.916s">You're</a>  never going to have a diversified staff because <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1647.479s">They're</a>  in demand and districts with money to burn or nobody has money to burn other than Cambridge, but other districts who have a higher pay scale are also looking and I don't for a second, of course, have any problems with staff going to find a place where they can get paid more. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1665.534s">That</a>  is a <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1668.1s">That's</a>  life, and that's what they should do if that's what they want. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1671.262s">But</a>  I want us to hear it, even if it puts us in an uncomfortable position when it's time to start our next negotiations for a contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1679.726s">I</a>  mean, if you come here and say, your teacher pay is 15% too low, and I'm just making up a number, I want to hear it, because I want to be able to answer to the community who will be like, OK, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1696.079s">year</a>  two, year three, year four, and you're still have, you know, essentially an all white workforce, what's happening? <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1703.442s">And</a>  the answer is, if part of the answer is we need to override to dramatically increase pay across the board, I'd like to know that instead of just imagining, you know, reading an ed report or comparing us to other towns by myself on the DESI documentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1722.089s">It'd</a>  be nice to have somebody who doesn't really have a stake in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1726.232s">to</a>  say, you can do all you want and you may have some success, but if a big root problem is your pay is not going to cut it, somebody has to tell us that other than me and other than the teachers union. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1740.5s">And,</a>  you know, like we all have too much in this game. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1744.343s">It's</a>  not a game, but so will you tell us that even if it's a very uncomfortable truth?</p>

    <p>[Weeks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1751.219s">Yes,</a>  I will.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1752.6s">That's</a>  a long way to ask that question.</p>

    <p>[Weeks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1754.341s">I</a>  appreciate your candor just now. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1757.003s">And</a>  I loved your terminology and your example. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1761.446s">So</a>  I'm here to tell you the truth. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1763.228s">And</a>  I'm not here to make anything up. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1765.149s">I'm</a>  here to tell you what the data is telling you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1767.511s">So</a>  the data will tell you the truth. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1768.872s">The</a>  data writes a script. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1769.952s">The</a>  data gives you the narrative. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1771.914s">And</a>  I give recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1773.575s">I</a>  can give a million recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1774.996s">But</a>  if you choose not to heed the recommendations, that is also your choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1779.479s">But</a>  it's going to be the truth.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1781.173s">Thank</a>  you so much.</p>

    <p>[Weeks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1781.853s">You're</a>  welcome and thanks for the question.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1787.657s">Member</a>  Mustone.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1788.817s">Thank</a>  you for being here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1790.018s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1791.238s">The</a>  part about reviewing the instructional practices policies, anything written, do you like highlight it and say, this needs to be worked on and give us a revision or do you leave us to do the revisioning?</p>

    <p>[Weeks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1804.666s">So</a>  the revisioning would come from you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1806.407s">The</a>  recommendations may say something like, <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1809.493s">I</a>  don't know, hypothetically, I believe, it's not just me, I keep saying I, we believe when we read whatever, we saw A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and here's a recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1819.679s">We</a>  believe that this recommendation will support fostering growth in this area. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1824.422s">However,</a>  the nitty gritty, the details, the details come from you all, and we would also recommend that you don't do it alone, but have a group of stakeholders. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1833.126s">So</a>  that's school committee, parents, <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1835.948s">you</a>  know, leaders and children as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1839.369s">In</a>  this work, I don't know if this is a bias or not, but in this work, children tell the truth. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1846.49s">They</a>  tell the story. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1847.651s">They</a>  tell us what they need. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1849.151s">And</a>  somehow along the way, we're losing that communication with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1852.752s">So</a>  I encourage us always to involve them in all of the stakeholder work. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1857.053s">They</a>  have to be a part of it because it's their lives, it's their future. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1860.753s">And</a>  I feel, we feel that they need to be a part of it.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1864.913s">Thank</a>  you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1865.554s">So</a>  Dr. Maurice, do you think the recommendations that we are given by the equity process come May, would they go to the Racial Equity Committee to put them into action or will we address that later on?</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1883.996s">So</a>  we definitely will be keeping the Race Equity Task Force updated. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1889.162s">Since</a>  this is specifically, even though we're going to get additional other information, they will be looped in this portion of the process of what we're being told about HR. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1900.133s">But</a>  I will definitely, when the whole process is completed, there will be <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1906.54s">a</a>  presentation to you, the committee, so you'll have what the recommendations are and what potential next steps are feasible at this point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1918.029s">So</a>  that is definitely something that you will have before the school year is out.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1924.033s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1924.493s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1926.275s">You're</a>  welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1926.835s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Weeks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1929.477s">Thank</a>  you so much.</p>

    <p>[Weeks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1931.498s">Thank</a>  you, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1932.419s">Stay</a>  safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1932.879s">Have</a>  a wonderful night. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1933.72s">You</a>  too. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1934.541s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1937.405s">Next,</a>  we have number three COVID update. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1939.346s">Assistant</a>  Superintendent of Finance and Operations, David Murphy and Avery Hines, Director of Health Services will report on operational updates and pending COVID shifts in the Metro Public School. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1950.65s">Mr.</a>  Murphy, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1951.431s">Hines.</a> </p>

    <p>[David Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1952.651s">Thank</a>  you, Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1953.712s">On</a>  the screen is a document that we circulated <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1960.004s">earlier</a>  this evening that I intend to walk you through tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1962.987s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1963.107s">Hines</a>  is available on the call as well for specific questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1967.771s">The</a>  superintendent mentioned in her opening comments this evening the success that we've had with our vaccination clinics running every Wednesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1976.779s">We</a>  intend to continue that through the month of February at least. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1979.941s">As</a>  I reported to you previously, our school nurses are phone banking both in addition to those clinics and while the clinics are happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1988.451s">and</a>  we are contacting both staff for purposes primarily for boosters. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1993.356s">A</a>  very limited number of unvaccinated staff at this point and also families who have not yet had their children vaccinated. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1999.483s">There</a>  have been some questions previously with the committee and I will get to the testing that's on the screen momentarily but just to <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2008.171s">We</a>  know there have been some questions from the committee previously regarding in-school vaccinations. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2016.217s">We</a>  are looking at the week of February 14th, just prior to the school vacation, to attempt to administer in-school vaccination clinics, at least at the elementary schools and potentially at the Andrews Middle School as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2032.85s">We're</a>  going to be working with the principals over the course of the next week to identify a space so that parent or caregivers who want to come in to be with their, particularly with some of the younger children for a brief period during the day, just prior to and after the administration of the vaccines, we want to provide that option to families as best we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2055.987s">Closer</a>  to the microphone. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2057.389s">I</a>  apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2059.13s">I</a>  don't know that I've ever been advised that before, so that's... <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2063.267s">The</a>  blow's on, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2065.629s">So</a>  we're looking for the vaccination clinics the week of February 14th to be in school. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2070.953s">We'll</a>  also have the app school portion for staff or people for whom it's more convenient, which we know for some families will probably be the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2081.262s">I'll</a>  take questions about the, any, any questions you have about the vaccine clinics, um, either now or after we walk through the testing, but tonight's update is focused more on some of the shifts and testing that have occurred or are going to occur, uh, based on information that we've received over the last two weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2097.527s">You'll</a>  recall during our, uh, January or January 10th, uh, meeting, um, uh, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2104.809s">Hines</a>  and I discussed with you how, as some of the variables with the pandemic were changing, <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2110.468s">There</a>  was a need for us to identify which variables we would need to change with regard to our testing protocols in order to keep the program sustainable. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2118.771s">And</a>  in that intervening time, DESE announced a program that districts across the Commonwealth, including Medford, <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2128.006s">will</a>  be taking advantage of, and it is essentially the distribution of a large volume of rapid at-home tests. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2137.452s">And</a>  this really does mark a shift, as some of you have called with questions in the previous, over the course of the last week, it really does mark a shift of <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2146.837s">sort</a>  of a moment in which what we have as an organization, the capacity to do on a more of a long-term basis, and I hope it's not long-term in terms of being measured in years, but it's something that we have the capacity to do more so than some of what we've been able to do over the course of the last year and a half. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2168.26s">And</a>  over the course of this last surge, frankly, we've really seen some of the challenges that arise when the organization takes on things that it frankly does not really have the capacity to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2180.642s">So</a>  we've made some adjustments in recent weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2183.543s">We</a>  transitioned to individual PCR testing. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2186.764s">That</a>  was necessary given the numbers and the positivity rate that we were seeing. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2190.724s">It</a>  is not something that is sustainable. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2193.985s">and</a>  we this week have transitioned back to pool testing and that we're one day into the return to pool testing but all reports are that it's gone well and obviously tomorrow we will see the return of the pool results that will determine its sustainability. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2212.044s">We</a>  intend to continue with the pooled PCR testing through the month of February. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2217.13s">However,</a>  we also intend to adopt the rapid at-home testing program that DESE has made available to districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2226.767s">In</a>  doing that, it does change some of our thinking with regard to how we ultimately step down our surveillance testing program, which, as we mentioned at the last meeting, is no longer the recommended course of action by the CDC and DPH. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2243.597s">And</a>  so as we transition, our plan is to go through a couple of different phases that will start with the <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2252.362s">the</a>  reduction of the official contact tracing that we're still doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2258.55s">You'll</a>  recall that we've mentioned before that the boards of health, including here in Medford, ceased contact tracing for the most part over this past summer, in the summer of 2021. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2269.605s">We</a>  made the decision as a school district to continue that contact tracing because we had essentially built up a robust testing program that we knew families and students and staff were relying on. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2284.461s">We</a>  think that that was the right, we and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2286.843s">Saenz</a>  can chime in, but as an administration we feel that was the right decision at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2292.328s">As</a>  you know, there were a number of occasions in which there were options to essentially take an off ramp from our testing program to transition to the test and stay program that at the time was was being endorsed by the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2304.053s">And</a>  we felt at the time, based on the factors on the ground, that our testing program essentially provided a greater level of insulation than the <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2314.998s">than</a>  the test and stay program. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2317.22s">Some</a>  of those variables have changed and it's being manifested in situations like today, when there were classes of a dozen or more students who were escorted down to the testing area and based on either previous positivity and maybe some cases in consent forms, but only a very small fraction of those classes were actually going through and having their tests administered. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2342.337s">That's</a>  not surprising based on the numbers that we've seen in recent weeks, but it also begins to tilt the scale with regard to exactly what benefits we are affording our students and families when we're running this program that is essentially occupying a significant amount of our time operationally for increasingly limited benefits. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2365.027s">and</a>  that equation begins to evolve even more so when there are rapid tests that we're able to send home. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2372.189s">So</a>  under this plan what we would do is again we would continue their surveillance testing and it's sort of a belt and suspenders approach that we would have an overlap with our surveillance testing and our rapid tests for the first several weeks but we would step down the contact tracing and then ultimately we would make the shift <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2388.033s">at</a>  the end of February to the diagnostic testing and testing of symptomatic. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2393.354s">We</a>  intend to maintain our partnership with Tufts and the Broad Institute so that we're not reliant only on the rapid antigen test that DESE is providing. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2402.916s">So,</a>  again, we're still going to be doing a both-and approach, but this will allow us to refocus our efforts, particularly in the health services department, on some of the core functions that <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2415.218s">are,</a>  to some extent, despite the best efforts and really herculean efforts of our school nurses. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2420.842s">But</a>  there are pieces of the work that are being neglected right now because of the approach that we've gone with, which I think it's fair to say it was a strategic decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2431.43s">And</a>  again, not one that I think any of us regret. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2434.753s">But</a>  we've sort of passed the point at which what we're doing is considered a best practice. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2442.058s">This</a>  would be pool testing for the next three weeks with contact tracing, pool testing for the next six weeks, excuse me, surveillance testing, and then the adoption of the rapid test distribution in the first week of February. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2455.887s">And</a>  eventually that will be the centerpiece of our testing strategy going forward in March. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2461.451s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2461.571s">Hines,</a>  is there anything you wanna add or did I get it right?</p>

    <p>[Avery Hines]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2467.815s">No,</a>  you got it right.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2469.116s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2472.373s">Mayor.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2474.209s">Member</a>  Ruseau. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2475.56s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2476.321s">Um,</a>  I, I really appreciate having the plan for future weeks, which is, seems like a huge turning point that we can plan more than the next day.</p>

    <p>[David Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2485.967s">You</a>  say that Mr. So, but you do remind me, it is conditioned upon the positivity rates declining. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2490.39s">I</a>  should, I should have that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2491.331s">So</a>  our expectation is declining positivity rates at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2495.054s">And</a>  assuming we see that, um, this would be what we would, how we would execute that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2499.637s">But</a>  I appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2500.437s">I</a>  don't know if that was a potential reminder or not, but I, if it was, I appreciate it.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2504.47s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2505.13s">I</a>  also think there's another dependency, that's that the state can come through with tests. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2508.851s">I</a>  still can't buy one at the CVS, can you? <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2512.053s">But</a>  somehow they're gonna distribute millions of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2515.194s">That's</a>  fascinating. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2516.914s">But</a>  my question was about, in the last, and on Friday's update from the superintendent, it said that you were doing PCRs this week, individual PCRs. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2525.577s">Was</a>  that just a?</p>

    <p>[David Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2526.417s">It</a>  was an error. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2527.578s">An</a>  error, okay.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2528.318s">I</a>  just wanted to share, nothing changed.</p>

    <p>[David Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2530.219s">It</a>  is full testing this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2532.203s">It</a>  is still PCR testing, and I think that's important that people should remember that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2536.685s">When</a>  we talk about PCR testing, it's the best in class, highest level of reliability, regardless of, or generally, regardless of viral load. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2544.589s">I'm</a>  not gonna attest to that myself, but more reliable, generally speaking, than the rapid test. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2550.292s">The</a>  pool test is just the way in which it's administered. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2552.693s">And</a>  just as an example, if I could, the problem with the pool testing, why ultimately, once the free rapid tests are available, we're keeping people fully out of the building, <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2561.897s">if</a>  they have enough viral load to test positive in a rapid test. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2565.359s">And</a>  the pool testing, which again, is our only option from a PCR perspective, there's a full 24 hour window in which, and really a 48 hour window, as compared to the rapid test in which people are coming into the building and potentially contagious. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2578.648s">At</a>  the beginning of this, those rapid tests weren't available to your point. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2581.649s">You</a>  know, we don't have them at our fingertips just yet, but assuming that that commitment by DESI is something that they, I think it will be, is executed properly. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2591.142s">This</a>  is a more reliable way. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2593.144s">And</a>  also importantly, and I should have mentioned this in my comments, <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2598.097s">students</a>  will need to opt into the program in order to receive the rapid tests. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2604.341s">That</a>  is a significant procedural step that I don't know that was necessarily a centerpiece of the media messaging with regard to DESE. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2613.107s">And</a>  one of our concerns is if we were to keep the surveillance testing open in perpetuity, in addition to the drain on resources, both human capital and financial, <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2622.173s">Um,</a>  we think it will be a disincentive for folks to opt into the rapid tests. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2626.177s">And</a>  so that is another reason that it needs to be phased out. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2630.202s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Sharon Hays]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2632.864s">Miss,</a>  um, member Hays. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2634.866s">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2635.587s">Um,</a>  I have a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2637.209s">If</a>  you could go back, I don't know if you can go back to the chart.</p>
