    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=131.146s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=132.587s">Today</a>  is January 24th, which the United Nations deemed in 2018 as the International Day of Education. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=143.238s">The</a>  declaration called for free and compulsory elementary education to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education for all by 2030. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=152.584s">The</a>  2022 theme is changing course, transforming education. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=162.625s">The</a>  United Nations resolution highlighted the importance of the fundamental right for everyone to education, to have an education, to help to build a more sustainable, inclusive, and peaceful world. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=178.675s">I'd</a>  like to share this evening on behalf of our community partner, Project Bread. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=184.338s">They</a>  have asked us to encourage our families to apply for critical SNAP benefits. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=191.377s">There</a>  have been policy changes made to SNAP, and we hope that our families will take the time to check it out at gettingsnap.org. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=202.284s">SNAP</a>  helps households meet nutritional and dietary needs, enables households to purchase food that is healthy and culturally appropriate, and supports low-wage households. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=219.925s">On</a>  a different note, I would like to add a special congratulations and share a very special happy birthday to Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=229.853s">Ginny</a>  Eugenia Christopoulos, who's the longtime school lunch mother at the Brooks Elementary School. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=238.701s">She</a>  celebrated her 90th birthday last week on January 19th. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=246.216s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=246.456s">Jenny,</a>  as she is affectionately called, has the energy of an elementary age student. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=253.179s">And</a>  she was a bright light and busy bee at the Brooks Elementary School. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=258.862s">She</a>  is a beloved member of the school community, and we appreciate her willingness to support our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=265.785s">So</a>  happy birthday, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=266.986s">Jenny.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=267.286s">90</a>  is a wonderful accomplishment. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=272.065s">I'd</a>  like to remind everyone to please note that this Wednesday, January 26th, that we'll be hosting a Zoom monthly support meeting for parents and caregivers with children dealing with autism spectrum disorder, ASD, and related disorders from 6.30 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=292.597s">to</a>  7.30 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=292.937s">this</a>  Wednesday evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=299.648s">Also</a>  on Wednesday, I'd like to thank in advance we have another vaccination clinic happening this Wednesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=306.576s">I</a>  want to thank Nurse Avery and all of the medical staff that have been working tirelessly in collaboration with our Board of Health partners. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=317.585s">and</a>  Mr. Murphy, who will also be providing a more detailed COVID-19 update shortly. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=322.988s">But</a>  I wanted to remind everyone that the vaccine clinic that's gonna be taking place this Wednesday will be from 12.30 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=330.651s">until</a>  6 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=334.577s">Not</a>  only is the COVID-19 vaccine available, but also the flu shot vaccine. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=340.761s">So</a>  we are now offering two types of shots, the COVID shot and the flu vaccine shot. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=350.408s">While</a>  the COVID vaccines are limited to staff and students only, the flu vaccines are state supplied and available for anyone, including uninsured adults. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=364.017s">My</a>  Friday message included the registration links, and they are located on the school blog as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=372.822s">This</a>  Thursday, January 27th, the Medford Family Network will be presenting a Zoom meeting with the topic, Keeping Kids Safe on the Internet. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=385.009s">This</a>  is a training for parents and caregivers of children eight years old and younger. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=391.953s">It</a>  will be held from 730 to 830 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=396.035s">Please</a>  register with the Medford Family Network. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=399.817s">Also,</a>  the Medford Family Network is seeking donations of diapers, sizes five and six, as well as wipes. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=410.142s">If</a>  you are able to assist, please call Medford Family Network at 781-393-2106. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=422.084s">So</a>  after a three-week shutdown due to COVID-19 concerns, I'm happy to report that our Mustang athletes are back on the court, which includes our middle school basketball teams, and they are back on the ice as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=438.192s">Additionally,</a>  our gymnastics team and indoor track team have returned to competition. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=444.935s">So</a>  I'd like to wish good luck to all of our winter sports teams. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=450.397s">I</a>  also want to share the good news that our new beautiful Charlotte and William Bloomberg Medford Public Library is open and is busy scheduling all types of in-person and Zoom events for all ages. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=466.407s">They</a>  just announced the 2022 teen reading challenge for students in grades six through 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=475.214s">For</a>  students who might be interested, please contact Nicole at the library at 781-475-5735. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=486.723s">Another</a>  important update, Medford High School, regarding our MSBA application deadline update, <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=497.6s">So</a>  the MSBA, Massachusetts School Building Authority and Central Administration, we will be presenting a report to you later this evening for the application window with MSBA for the peer projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=512.549s">The</a>  application window opens this Friday, January 28, 2022. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=520.654s">and</a>  the administration plans to consider possible statements of interest, which we refer to as an SRI, about two programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=531.298s">There</a>  is the Accelerated Repair Program, ARP, which involves repairing potentially specific sections of schools, and the CORE program, which involves building a completely new school. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=547.945s">The</a>  respective deadlines are March 25th and April 29th. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=553.948s">This</a>  important work will require the collaboration and support of many stakeholders in order to be successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=561.092s">A</a>  report again later this evening will be presented to the entire body. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=567.553s">In</a>  closing, I would like to say that Chinese New Year 2022, also called the Lunar New Year in the Spring Festival, begins Tuesday, February 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=583.122s">It</a>  is the year of the tiger, and those born during this year are predicted to be brave, competitive, unpredictable, and confident. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=594.952s">We</a>  express our wishes of good health and happiness to all of our Asian families and friends who celebrate the 16-day festival. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=604.835s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=606.595s">Thank</a>  you, Dr. Edward-Vincent. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=609.056s">Number</a>  two, we have an introduction to the equity process. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=612.357s">The</a>  equity process, a firm hired to conduct the equity audit of Medford Public Schools will present the scope of work for Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=621.202s">Cindy</a>  Weeks Bradley, CEO of the Equity Process, and Superintendent of Schools, Dr. Maurice-Edouard-Vincent.</p>

    <p>[Weeks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=672.522s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=677.064s">Thank</a>  you for having me this evening, and I'll just give you a brief presentation of what we expect to do in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=684.647s">So</a>  first of all, <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=690.332s">If</a>  you can take a look at the screen, and I'm sure you already know, but this is our mission. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=697.553s">Next</a>  slide, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=699.734s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=700.854s">This</a>  is our mission and vision. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=702.714s">Pretty</a>  much we're here to help diversify the school place, and that diversity does not end at race. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=708.175s">It</a>  continues on to ethnicities and abilities and genders and sex and all the gamut, runs the whole gamut. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=715.736s">Currently,</a>  we'll be looking at your HR system within the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=719.377s">to</a>  see if there are any ways that we can help enhance the work that you're already doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=723.719s">So</a>  we're not here to shine a light and say, oh, no, no, it's really to help you progress into 21st century learning with the best HR practices that are out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=733.982s">Next</a>  slide, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=735.183s">Thank</a>  you, Pierre. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=737.194s">Humanity</a>  over politics is where I stand. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=740.075s">I</a>  really don't get into politics. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=741.675s">I</a>  don't watch the news. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=743.696s">I</a>  don't really read too much of the newspaper. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=746.416s">I'm</a>  a person of compassion and I feel like together we can solve these issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=750.837s">It's</a>  really not all the other stuff that's out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=753.038s">So</a>  when I say humanity over politics, I really mean that it's nothing that I can do alone or my organization can do by itself, but everyone comes together collaboratively for the betterment of all students, because that's why we're here. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=767.381s">Next</a>  slide, please, Peter. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=771.444s">I</a>  usually use a lot of words for this, but I decided that I should use a visual. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=776.548s">What</a>  does the equity audit look like? <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=778.31s">What</a>  it really looks like is us just doing a lot of work, so combing through tons and tons of policies and procedures and practices and talking to people, and that's to facilitate discussions and the focus groups and surveys and really checking to see <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=795.082s">which</a>  patterns emerge, what is already there, what isn't there, how can we enhance? <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=800.087s">That's</a>  us just doing the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=803.07s">But</a>  what it does not look like is the next slide, please, Peter. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=808.558s">Oh,</a>  sorry, this is still what it looks like. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=811.8s">So</a>  I took a look at this report from Stanford University, written in April 2021. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=816.483s">And</a>  it really gets into like the pieces of the audit that looks at diversity and leadership, community engagement, HR policies, where's where I will be right now, engaging like the culture of the community and not just the school, as well as learning and development. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=834.114s">Thank</a>  you, Peter. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=834.754s">Next</a>  slide, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=837.023s">Here's</a>  the one where it does not look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=839.927s">This</a>  is quite interesting because usually once reports are done, people will ask a lot of questions like where's this, where's that, where's the next, where's the third. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=847.997s">It</a>  is not a scientific method by any means, so I don't want you to believe that I'm coming in here and <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=854.285s">I'm</a>  going to do this scientific experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=856.467s">That's</a>  not what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=857.367s">It's</a>  really looking at your data very closely and seeing what matters to the city of Medford, the public of Medford, the community of Medford and the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=867.735s">So</a>  it's tying all those pieces together. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=870.537s">We</a>  will not have a research topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=872.919s">That's</a>  why it's not a scientific experiment because we have our own expertise in this area, but we're not researching a specific topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=880.744s">You</a>  will not have a hypothesis. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=882.445s">That's</a>  not cool at all for this kind of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=884.865s">What</a>  we're doing is really allowing the data to write the script or the narrative. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=889.207s">So</a>  it's what your data shows us. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=891.487s">And</a>  there is no test or experiment. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=893.388s">It</a>  is what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=894.088s">This</a>  is what your data says. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=895.789s">Here's</a>  the information, and here are our recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=899.13s">Next</a>  slide, please, Frida. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=903.051s">simply</a>  stated, how do we do all this? <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=905.092s">We</a>  aim first to get to know everyone that we come in contact with. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=909.013s">There'll</a>  be an opportunity for school committee members if you are interested to volunteer and do one-on-one interviews. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=914.654s">You</a>  don't have to do them, but I feel that your voice is utterly important, so you'll have that opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=920.196s">We</a>  will interview folks in HR and the leadership team, and we'll interview Maurice, <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=926.217s">We'll</a>  also give an opportunity for unsolicited information to be included. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=930.918s">When</a>  we do audits, people tend to email me all sorts of stuff, so we take that into consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=938.18s">We</a>  look at the implicit bias tools that you're currently using and think, are there any that we should be using? <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=944.121s">Things</a>  like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=944.821s">Handbook,</a>  right at the bottom you'll see handbook, employee handbook, union handbook. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=949.53s">content</a>  level curriculum, behavioral policies. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=953.051s">How</a>  does our work impact children and what is the relationship that we have with kids every day? <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=958.753s">Not</a>  just face-to-face relationships, but also on paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=964.435s">Next</a>  slide, please, Peter. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=968.092s">And</a>  this is probably, okay, I'll be, I'm telling you, I'm a little biased right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=971.713s">This</a>  is my favorite part, where I ask this question, what might a great experience look like for all students in Medford and not just some? <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=979.196s">Because</a>  we know that there are some students that are doing really, really well and some students that are not doing well, but my job is to figure out how can we all come together and help all students do well? <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=990.099s">You</a>  don't have to answer that question, but food for thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=993.54s">And</a>  how do we ensure, because it is our responsibility as well, including mine, even though I'm not a resident of Medford, how do we ensure and embrace the notion of students in minority populations? <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1004.507s">So</a>  once again, I'm not just here for race, I'm here for students in all minority populations. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1010.79s">So</a>  I put a little caveat there, BIPOCs, L, students with disability, LGBTQIA++, students from varied ethnicities and religions outside of the dominant culture. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1022.657s">and</a>  many others. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1023.298s">So</a>  how can we ensure that they feel safe and actualize their vision of success too? <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1029.384s">I'm</a>  an immigrant. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1030.185s">I</a>  come from Barbados. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1031.206s">I</a>  came here when I was five. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1032.988s">America</a>  is so vastly different from Barbados. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1035.13s">I</a>  had all my education here. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1036.912s">UMass</a>  Boston, my bachelor's degree, my master's from Simmons College, which is now Simmons University. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1042.738s">and</a>  lots of, you know, professional development going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1046.299s">One</a>  thing I can tell you about Barbados is this little, if you don't know, it's a tiny, tiny, itsy bitsy country with a hundred percent literacy. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1053.442s">So</a>  it baffles me. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1054.782s">How</a>  does grand America not have a hundred percent literacy? <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1058.764s">How</a>  do we have homelessness? <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1060.084s">How</a>  do we not support one another? <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1061.665s">So</a>  it's just ingrained within me to do this work. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1065.486s">And</a>  I really want to make sure that students can have the choice when they graduate from high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1071.388s">So</a>  it's not us telling you, well, you're going to go to college, you're going to do a trade or I don't know, you're going to be a vagrant on the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1077.834s">That's</a>  not our job. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1078.975s">Our</a>  job is to give them the best so that they can have choices. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1082.258s">And</a>  that's critically why I'm here today. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1085.3s">And</a>  I will end with this last slide, please, Peter. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1089.504s">Do</a>  you have any questions that I can answer for you? <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1094.588s">Thank</a>  you, Peter.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1097.851s">Yes,</a>  Paul. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1099.295s">And</a>  there are so thank you thank you for the presentation.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1103.139s">Thank</a>  you for the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1105.161s">So</a>  I certainly understand my HR is sort of the first thing here is there a plan to keep coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1115.83s">I</a>  mean, HR isn't the whole shebang. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1119.191s">I</a>  get that it's sort of like a critical step, because it's like how we get our people, or even how we treat our people. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1128.834s">There's</a>  a lot about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1129.894s">But</a>  is it too soon, having not done this yet for HR, to know what the next step is, or have you been engaged for a next step?</p>

    <p>[Weeks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1140.675s">So</a>  the next steps is truly up to, I just say, Maurice, I don't know what your technical terms are, so forgive me not being disrespectful. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1149.042s">But</a>  the next steps is for you and her to have a conversation to see how deep you want to go with the equity audit. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1154.987s">But</a>  since it's such a large district, when her and I talked, we thought it would be best to start in pieces. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1160.812s">And</a>  HR was the first place to start, because we don't have the right people, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1165.436s">in</a>  front of students and how do we begin to move the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1168.537s">And</a>  it's really about 21st century learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1170.758s">So</a>  we're not saying like, Oh, it's so bad right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1173.659s">What</a>  we're saying is what does the future need for our students to be successful? <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1178.261s">And</a>  is it currently here right now? <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1180.002s">And</a>  if it's not, what do we need to do to ensure that it's here?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1183.904s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1184.424s">You're</a>  welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1189.526s">Thank</a>  you so much for the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1191.727s">Oh,</a>  member of Graham.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1193.363s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1193.803s">Um,</a>  I had a couple of questions as, as I was looking through this. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1198.905s">So</a>  when you say this, the scope of this initial piece is HR, can you give us a sense of what that means to you in terms of the things and systems and types of procedures that you are going to be looking at in this phase?</p>
