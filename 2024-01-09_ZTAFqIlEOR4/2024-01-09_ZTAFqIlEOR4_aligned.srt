And myself present, seven present, zero absent.

24
00:04:57,469 --> 00:04:59,270
If we could all please rise to salute the flag.

25
00:05:00,331 --> 00:05:05,555
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands,

26
00:05:08,784 --> 00:05:10,505
with liberty and justice for all.

27
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:21,631
We have our school committee reorganization and we will proceed with election of the vice chair.

28
00:05:22,612 --> 00:05:26,874
Is there any member Branley?

29
00:05:28,335 --> 00:05:33,057
I would like to nominate member Graham for second.

30
00:05:33,818 --> 00:05:37,160
Member Branley, seconded by member Reinfeld is nominated.

31
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:37,920
Member Graham,

32
00:05:39,465 --> 00:05:43,126
There are no additional appointments.

33
00:05:43,946 --> 00:05:44,826
I will call the roll.

34
00:05:46,507 --> 00:05:47,447
Member McLaughlin?

35
00:05:47,707 --> 00:05:47,927
Yes.

36
00:05:49,508 --> 00:05:50,388
Just state her name.

37
00:05:51,528 --> 00:05:52,189
State the name, yes.

38
00:05:52,549 --> 00:05:54,449
Please, Member McLaughlin, if you could state Member Graham.

39
00:05:55,089 --> 00:05:55,950
Just her name, thank you.

00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:57,650

00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:10,709
and myself, member Graham.

50
00:06:10,849 --> 00:06:15,250
Seven in the affirmative for member Jenny Graham to be our vice chair.

51
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,091
Congratulations.

52
00:06:16,111 --> 00:06:23,053
Thank you.

53
00:06:23,073 --> 00:06:25,694
Next up, we have election of secretary.

54
00:06:25,714 --> 00:06:31,196
I would like to nominate member Russo.

55
00:06:32,416 --> 00:06:34,477
Member Russo nominated by member Olaparte.

56
00:06:35,177 --> 00:06:35,477
Second.

57
00:06:36,038 --> 00:06:36,978
Seconded by member Graham.

58
00:06:39,616 --> 00:06:40,817
Are there any of the nominations?

59
00:06:41,737 --> 00:06:43,739
Hearing and seeing none, I'll call the roll.

60
00:06:43,939 --> 00:06:44,720
Member McLaughlin.

61
00:06:47,742 --> 00:06:48,282
Member Rousseau.

62
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:50,924
Member Olaparde.

63
00:06:51,224 --> 00:06:51,845
Member Rousseau.

64
00:06:52,325 --> 00:06:52,965
Member Reinfeldt.

65
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:53,886
Member Rousseau.

66
00:06:54,607 --> 00:06:55,067
Member Graham.

67
00:06:55,567 --> 00:06:56,128
Member Rousseau.

68
00:06:56,488 --> 00:06:57,028
Member Brantley.

69
00:06:57,268 --> 00:06:57,809
Member Rousseau.

70
00:06:58,469 --> 00:07:00,251
And myself, Member Rousseau.

71
00:07:00,271 --> 00:07:01,952
70 affirmative, zero in the negative.

72
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:04,894
Congratulations to our secretary, Member Rousseau.

73
00:07:09,275 --> 00:07:13,499
We have number five, consent agenda, bills and payrolls, and regular school committee.

74
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,722
Oh, good of the order, yes, number four.

75
00:07:16,742 --> 00:07:19,244
Does anybody have anything for good of the order?

76
00:07:19,264 --> 00:07:20,885
Member Graham.

77
00:07:21,286 --> 00:07:21,786
Thank you.

78
00:07:21,806 --> 00:07:32,216
I actually, you all received from me earlier today just a Google form that outlines what our committees are.

79
00:07:34,008 --> 00:07:39,251
Basically, the mayor and I worked on it together, and she was having some access issues to get it out the door, so I sent it.

80
00:07:39,371 --> 00:07:42,453
But it outlines a couple of things.

81
00:07:42,513 --> 00:07:46,375
First, it outlines our committees from last time, from the last session.

82
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:49,377
We are under no obligation to keep them.

83
00:07:49,877 --> 00:07:57,521
So as you look at them, if you're like, I don't know what that committee does or why it would do anything, it's OK to say, I don't think we need that committee.

84
00:07:57,581 --> 00:08:01,883
So for example, in our last session, we had a personnel and budget subcommittee.

85
00:08:02,284 --> 00:08:02,804
They never met.

86
00:08:03,342 --> 00:08:14,271
And I think that's actually one that I will say I don't think that we need because we tend to operate a little bit differently when it comes to matters like the budget where we tend to all work on them together.

87
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:16,032
So that's just going to be my vote.

88
00:08:16,553 --> 00:08:21,957
But there may be other people who feel differently about some of the other subcommittees that are listed.

89
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:31,785
And so there's one component of the request is just to hear from you all what you think the committee should be, the standing committees.

90
00:08:32,904 --> 00:08:39,448
And then another piece for you to tell us what committees you want to be a part of.

91
00:08:39,609 --> 00:08:42,170
So subcommittees are comprised of three members.

92
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:47,534
They can't be comprised of more than three members, because then that represents a quorum of this larger committee.

93
00:08:47,914 --> 00:08:49,555
And suddenly, you're not a subcommittee anymore.

94
00:08:49,575 --> 00:08:50,576
You're actually just the committee.

95
00:08:51,496 --> 00:08:55,499
So the subcommittees tend to do work that is sent there by this group.

96
00:08:57,182 --> 00:09:15,634
You there, there are some sort of exceptions, but generally something comes to the floor and we say, we want to send this to subcommittee to be to, to, to do X, Y, or Z. And so the way I set up the request, um, after we had some discussion about it was to say, please tell us what, how you want to be involved in these committees.

97
00:09:15,694 --> 00:09:17,795
Like you don't have to be involved in any committees.

98
00:09:18,556 --> 00:09:20,537
Um, you could be involved in all of the committees.

99
00:09:21,277 --> 00:09:25,520
It sort of depends on interest and time and all of that stuff.

100
00:09:26,035 --> 00:09:37,719
But I also provided a place for people to say, I'd like to chair this committee, or I want to be on this committee, or I'm willing to be on this committee, which I think is just a little bit different.

101
00:09:37,779 --> 00:09:41,700
And then I don't want to be on this committee for whatever reason.

102
00:09:42,304 --> 00:09:45,665
And then we can get all those results and then take a look at it.

103
00:09:45,725 --> 00:09:52,888
And in a future meeting, the mayor can present to us what her like proposed subcommittee structure is.

104
00:09:53,809 --> 00:09:56,990
And based on that feedback, and then we can have some discussion.

105
00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:04,413
We all ultimately have to vote on it, but it is just a good way for you all to say like, these are the topics that interest me.

106
00:10:05,933 --> 00:10:09,635
It's okay for you to say, I want to be the chair of something, even if you've never done it before.

107
00:10:11,271 --> 00:10:13,013
help you manage through those first ones.

108
00:10:13,093 --> 00:10:19,758
Like the subcommittees are a really nice place to do that because they tend to be sort of confined topics.

109
00:10:19,778 --> 00:10:26,023
Like you'll be working on a specific thing or reacting to something that came to you by the larger committee.

110
00:10:26,123 --> 00:10:28,846
So you all have that, I think, in your email box.

111
00:10:28,886 --> 00:10:30,467
And if you don't let me know and I'll send it.

112
00:10:31,528 --> 00:10:36,552
But really it's just a chance for us to say like, are these even the right committees for us anymore?

113
00:10:36,712 --> 00:10:40,355
If there's stuff you think we should be adding, like there's a space for you to do that too.

114
00:10:41,192 --> 00:10:46,656
The high school building committee, completely separate topic and not part of what we're signing.

115
00:10:47,157 --> 00:10:47,297
Yep.

116
00:10:47,477 --> 00:10:52,541
Thank you for taking the lead on developing that survey.

117
00:10:52,561 --> 00:10:53,242
Appreciate it.

118
00:10:53,402 --> 00:11:06,052
And then I just also, if you want to either send it to me separately or within that survey, you want to outline what your first, second, third, fourth choices are, because even if you want it to be on all of them, you probably won't be because

119
00:11:06,485 --> 00:11:08,088
I can only pick three per committee.

120
00:11:08,148 --> 00:11:14,257
So I do try to do it as fairly as possible, where you'll chair one or two and then be on one or two others.

121
00:11:14,478 --> 00:11:17,042
So please feel free to list your priorities as well.

122
00:11:18,203 --> 00:11:18,584
Thank you.

123
00:11:19,586 --> 00:11:19,806
May I?

124
00:11:20,407 --> 00:11:21,268
Yes, Member McLaughlin.

125
00:11:21,328 --> 00:11:21,908
Thank you.

126
00:11:21,948 --> 00:11:23,329
Yeah, thank you, Member Graham, for this.

127
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:29,313
This is, I think, a much more efficient way of looking at the process and having people weigh in.

128
00:11:29,393 --> 00:11:30,153
So it's really helpful.

129
00:11:30,693 --> 00:11:33,735
There's just a few committees that I don't recognize from before.

130
00:11:33,795 --> 00:11:40,059
And I'm wondering, I mean, I know the superintendent evaluation was an ad hoc committee that we had sort of added for one of our goals.

131
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:42,281
I like the idea of keeping it, but I just see that.

132
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:46,683
And then there was another, which was, I think strategic planning was the same idea.

133
00:11:47,124 --> 00:11:49,305
And so are those ones that you guys have said,

134
00:11:49,901 --> 00:11:51,641
you want to try to move forward with?

135
00:11:51,762 --> 00:11:53,922
Or weren't those just unique to last year?

136
00:11:55,182 --> 00:12:08,726
So last term, we basically took what previously was family engagement, communication, and strategic planning and separated it, which I think there's just too much going on there for it to be one topic.

137
00:12:08,806 --> 00:12:10,567
So last term, we did separate it.

138
00:12:10,987 --> 00:12:11,787
Both did meet.

139
00:12:12,507 --> 00:12:15,728
There's at least one thing, I think, in strategic planning right now.

140
00:12:16,468 --> 00:12:19,169
And I was just waiting to schedule something to, like,

141
00:12:19,522 --> 00:12:20,142
move forward on that.

142
00:12:20,162 --> 00:12:24,184
So I do think those two things, those two make sense to carry over from last year.

143
00:12:24,204 --> 00:12:28,647
And I put superintendent evaluation on because it was an ad hoc last year.

144
00:12:28,687 --> 00:12:34,650
But if, if we think that we want to continue with that process, we should just make it a standing committee so that there's some expectation there.

145
00:12:48,277 --> 00:12:50,838
I just also wanted to put in for a point of information.

146
00:12:50,878 --> 00:13:05,002
While anyone can request to be chair or on the committee, even after three school committee members are on a committee, other school committee members can attend the committee meeting.

147
00:13:05,882 --> 00:13:08,023
They're just not able to weigh in, obviously, and vote.

148
00:13:08,283 --> 00:13:12,424
So you can still attend and listen if there are ones that you're interested in.

149
00:13:13,264 --> 00:13:13,544
That's it.

150
00:13:13,664 --> 00:13:14,004
Thank you.

151
00:13:15,005 --> 00:13:15,745
Yep.

152
00:13:15,805 --> 00:13:16,345
Member Reinfeldt?

153
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:28,039
Yeah, I was curious, is there on our, I think there's a shared Google Drive that we got access to today, is there, does that have the archive of the meetings and kind of agendas of what these committees have done?

154
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:28,499
Yeah.

155
00:13:28,719 --> 00:13:29,500
Okay, great.

156
00:13:30,421 --> 00:13:30,661
Thank you.

157
00:13:32,884 --> 00:13:35,246
And so I had one other topic.

158
00:13:35,426 --> 00:13:36,607
Yes.

159
00:13:37,128 --> 00:13:42,593
I reached out to me I see because they do a whole variety of training.

160
00:13:42,633 --> 00:13:48,559
But one of the trainings that Tracy Novick will do on our for us is a training around Chapter 70.

161
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:54,084
So Chapter 70 is how the state funds municipalities as it relates to education.

162
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:58,676
There's a lot of changes happening in Chapter 70 because of the Student Opportunity Act.

163
00:13:58,716 --> 00:14:03,300
And we're like maybe a little bit more than halfway through the full funding of Student Opportunity Act.

164
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,382
But Chapter 70 funding is wildly complicated.

165
00:14:06,602 --> 00:14:10,485
It's one piece of how our schools are funded in Medford.

166
00:14:11,386 --> 00:14:17,751
But Tracy is willing to come and do a training session with us about Chapter 70.

167
00:14:17,951 --> 00:14:20,093
And every time she does this talk, she picks

168
00:14:21,082 --> 00:14:22,083
she picks a community.

169
00:14:22,103 --> 00:14:29,509
So when you go to charting the course, you'll see her pick a community and then sort of dive through their chapter 70 and say, this is what's really happening.

170
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:30,891
Like, this is what these numbers mean.

171
00:14:30,951 --> 00:14:32,192
This is how this impacts them.

172
00:14:33,173 --> 00:14:42,260
And every time I go and I listened to her do this chapter 70 talk, I'm like, she picked Medford because I would be really interested on her take on what is happening in chapter 70.

173
00:14:42,701 --> 00:14:44,722
So I reached out to her.

174
00:14:44,742 --> 00:14:47,545
She said, it's about like an hour and a half ish training.

175
00:14:48,306 --> 00:14:56,228
And she has pretty open availability in the month of February, which I think is good timing for us to do that before budget season really starts.

176
00:14:58,208 --> 00:15:13,091
And she I just told her that I would bring it to the group and we could decide if there was a date and time that would work well, but I think it's a nice sort of lead into the budget discussions which will become just a huge part of what we're doing here soon so.

177
00:15:14,189 --> 00:15:21,014
I think the question is really around scheduling and whether we want to try to find a time to do that as a group, not knowing.

178
00:15:21,114 --> 00:15:27,999
I think the other thing that would be helpful, I think, for all of us is to know generally when are people available?

179
00:15:28,099 --> 00:15:29,720
Can you start a meeting at 5 or 6?

180
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:32,682
Are you not available at all on Wednesdays?

181
00:15:32,762 --> 00:15:38,986
Those kinds of things I think maybe we should try to understand better across this new committee, because I think you learn that over time.

182
00:15:40,816 --> 00:15:50,178
In the meantime, to schedule this, I think we would just need some date options that we could bring to Tracy and see if she can plan to come in and do this training for us on one of those dates.

183
00:15:51,219 --> 00:15:51,619
Sounds great.

184
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:52,439
Thank you, Member Graham.

185
00:15:53,939 --> 00:15:54,260
Mayor?

186
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,500
Member McLaughlin.

187
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:56,520
Thank you.

188
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:02,362
For the good of the order as well, I just wanted to bring up the school committee goals.

189
00:16:02,402 --> 00:16:03,222
I know we're talking about

190
00:16:04,591 --> 00:16:13,358
Superintendent goals tonight, and I do think that we need to review school committee goals and have it on the agenda and talk about I think we had two goals last year.

191
00:16:13,378 --> 00:16:21,544
And I think we should, you know, talk about those and How we did on them and then think about what goals.

192
00:16:21,644 --> 00:16:24,126
This committee might want to set moving forward.

193
00:16:25,266 --> 00:16:28,629
So that just sort of something under the good of the order, but I don't know if we want to

194
00:16:29,386 --> 00:16:35,108
If you have an idea, Superintendent, on when you might wanna put that, or Mayor, on when you might wanna put that on the agenda.

195
00:16:35,588 --> 00:16:44,090
I think that was the school committee goals, so we can discuss it amongst the committee, or decide tonight, maybe the second meeting, or first meeting in February.

196
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:44,650
Okay.

197
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:48,631
And everybody can have about a month to think through what the goals are.

198
00:16:48,651 --> 00:16:54,433
In the meantime, maybe somebody from the admin can just send us the two goals we chose last year, so the new members have them.

199
00:16:55,713 --> 00:16:56,093
Thank you.

200
00:16:57,714 --> 00:16:57,854
Great.

201
00:16:59,070 --> 00:16:59,350
Thank you.

202
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:09,652
We have the consent agenda, bills and- Before you go on, we probably should have started with like what the good of the order is in case you, the new folks don't know.

203
00:17:09,712 --> 00:17:11,413
You did tell us our first meeting we attended.

204
00:17:11,813 --> 00:17:12,473
It would be weird.

205
00:17:12,533 --> 00:17:12,653
Yeah.

206
00:17:12,693 --> 00:17:13,593
Okay.

207
00:17:13,613 --> 00:17:13,973
No, no, no.

208
00:17:13,993 --> 00:17:14,333
You said it.

209
00:17:14,413 --> 00:17:14,873
You told us.

210
00:17:14,893 --> 00:17:15,393
You told us.

211
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:16,254
You explained it.

212
00:17:16,334 --> 00:17:16,674
Okay.

213
00:17:16,774 --> 00:17:17,114
Okay.

214
00:17:17,154 --> 00:17:17,534
Good, good, good.

215
00:17:17,654 --> 00:17:17,834
Okay.

216
00:17:18,274 --> 00:17:21,855
I just wanted to make sure like we're not leaving you in the dust as we explain.

217
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:22,055
Okay.

218
00:17:22,595 --> 00:17:23,435
But I appreciate that leaving us.

219
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:25,256
We've been out of it suit too for a while.

220
00:17:25,336 --> 00:17:26,876
So please let us know if you need us to

221
00:17:28,011 --> 00:17:30,012
Help out on that front as well.

222
00:17:37,817 --> 00:17:47,242
My first few weeks in office, I went home and just with my head spinning on all the acronyms, then COVID had snapped me into reality.

223
00:17:47,522 --> 00:17:48,062
Figured it out.

224
00:17:48,082 --> 00:17:50,043
I figured it out.

225
00:17:50,724 --> 00:17:50,904
Okay.

226
00:17:52,119 --> 00:17:58,162
So we do have the consent agenda, bills and payrolls, regular school committee minutes, December 18th, 2023.

227
00:18:00,863 --> 00:18:03,204
Motion to sever the minutes from December 18th.

228
00:18:03,604 --> 00:18:06,245
Motion to sever the consent agenda.

229
00:18:06,905 --> 00:18:08,386
So second.

230
00:18:08,686 --> 00:18:09,887
Seconded by member Graham.

231
00:18:09,927 --> 00:18:10,667
All those in favor?

232
00:18:10,687 --> 00:18:11,147
Aye.

233
00:18:11,707 --> 00:18:12,648
All those opposed?

234
00:18:13,488 --> 00:18:16,189
The consent agenda has been severed.

235
00:18:16,249 --> 00:18:17,530
I'll start with bills and payrolls.

236
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:19,731
Is there a motion for approval on bills and payrolls?

237
00:18:21,775 --> 00:18:23,276
by Member McLaughlin, seconded by?

238
00:18:23,656 --> 00:18:23,956
Second.

239
00:18:24,857 --> 00:18:25,898
Member Reinfeldt.

240
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:26,898
All those in favor?

241
00:18:26,918 --> 00:18:27,959
Aye.

242
00:18:28,139 --> 00:18:28,900
All those opposed?

243
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,400
Bills and payrolls have been approved.

244
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:33,262
Now we have the regular school committee meeting minutes from December 18th, 2023.

245
00:18:34,483 --> 00:18:38,626
I motion to approve these with the correction of the spelling of my name.

246
00:18:40,247 --> 00:18:48,592
Motion to approve as amended the regular school committee meeting minutes from December 18th, 2023 by Member Reinfeldt, seconded by Member McLaughlin.

247
00:18:48,672 --> 00:18:49,472
All those in favor?

248
00:18:49,492 --> 00:18:49,553
Aye.

249
00:18:50,703 --> 00:18:51,224
Opposed?

250
00:18:51,264 --> 00:18:52,946
Motion passes as amended.

251
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:56,569
We do not have any reports of subcommittees.

252
00:18:57,090 --> 00:19:02,836
We have seven reports under the superintendent's updates.

253
00:19:03,717 --> 00:19:06,399
First is the superintendent's updates and comments.

254
00:19:06,499 --> 00:19:07,681
Dr. Reese-Edward Benson.

255
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:10,850
Good evening and Happy New Year.

256
00:19:11,731 --> 00:19:20,338
I would like to begin by welcoming our three new school committee members, Nicole Brantley, Erin Olopade, and Erica Reinfeld.

257
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:29,265
I know I speak for the entire Medford Public Schools community when I offer our warmest welcome, congratulations, and best wishes.

258
00:19:30,726 --> 00:19:32,027
Welcome back to the committee.

259
00:19:32,628 --> 00:19:37,712
Mayor Lungo Kern, Member Graham, Member McLaughlin, and Member Russo.

260
00:19:38,353 --> 00:19:43,457
I look forward to continuing our innovative work together for the Medford Public Schools.

261
00:19:45,376 --> 00:19:53,665
Because of the weekend snowstorm, the city's formal inauguration ceremony has been rescheduled to this Wednesday at 6pm.

262
00:19:54,807 --> 00:20:04,598
I'm looking forward to joining everyone to celebrate public service and the start of the new term for our mayor, city counselors and school committee members.

263
00:20:08,194 --> 00:20:11,036
Now transitioning to school affairs.

264
00:20:12,276 --> 00:20:15,518
Kindergarten registration, it's a critically important time.

265
00:20:16,218 --> 00:20:21,561
This is very, very important for how our elementary schools function.

266
00:20:22,802 --> 00:20:32,767
So kindergarten registration for the 24-25 school year opens on Tuesday next week, January 16th, one week from tomorrow.

267
00:20:34,665 --> 00:20:51,400
If you know a caregiver of a child who will be starting kindergarten next year, please let them know they are invited to attend one of the upcoming informational sessions to learn about our kindergarten program and have the opportunity to ask questions directly.

268
00:20:52,521 --> 00:20:55,724
So the meeting next week in person

269
00:20:57,051 --> 00:21:04,395
meeting will be on Wednesday, January 17, and Thursday, March 28 at 6.30pm.

270
00:21:04,956 --> 00:21:11,600
Again, those are in-person meetings at Medford High School in the library.

271
00:21:13,257 --> 00:21:20,319
The February meeting on Tuesday, February 27th, that meeting will also take place at 6.30 p.m.

272
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,180
That meeting will be by Zoom.

273
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:31,223
So again, in person next Wednesday, January 17th and Thursday, March 28th at 6.30 p.m.

274
00:21:31,823 --> 00:21:35,024
and by Zoom on Tuesday, February 27th at 6.30 p.m.

275
00:21:38,345 --> 00:21:46,813
critically important, please spread the word so we can get accurate numbers of our kindergarten students, and for the new members that are here today.

276
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:56,283
This past school year we had an unusual rush in August, increased kindergarten enrollment.

277
00:21:56,943 --> 00:22:01,664
that we were required to open for additional kindergarten sessions.

278
00:22:02,324 --> 00:22:08,086
So to the best of your ability, we're going to really try to make sure we register our kindergartners earlier.

279
00:22:08,906 --> 00:22:22,230
I do want the community to also know that during our information sessions, child care and interpretation services will be available at those meetings, and more information will be available on our school website.

280
00:22:24,292 --> 00:22:29,197
Another wonderful topic to just share some key highlights with you is in the area of athletics.

281
00:22:30,598 --> 00:22:43,733
I want to do the special recognition Medford High School's girls soccer team received national recognition by United soccer coaches.

282
00:22:45,194 --> 00:23:06,883
We received a silver level team ethics and sportsmanship award across the country 72 fall season boys and girls teams received either the platinum gold, silver or bronze version of the high school team ethics and sportsmanship award.

283
00:23:07,723 --> 00:23:24,252
which recognizes teams that exhibit fair play, sporting behavior, and adherence to the laws of the game, as reflected by the number of yellow caution cards or red ejection cards.

284
00:23:25,033 --> 00:23:28,314
They are shown by referees throughout the season.

285
00:23:29,795 --> 00:23:31,776
Medford girls soccer was one of 31 teams

286
00:23:34,218 --> 00:23:41,255
that claimed the silver award, which is given to teams that accumulate a percentage of cards, ranging from 11 to 30%.

287
00:23:44,867 --> 00:23:53,553
Only nine other Massachusetts teams were recognized with team ethics and sportsmanship awards this year.

288
00:23:54,894 --> 00:24:07,562
I want to send a special congratulations to coach Marco Siri, to our captains, Vivalyn Chavitana, who's grade 12, Josiah Kuyate, grade 11,

289
00:24:08,703 --> 00:24:19,591
Grace Mastromatteo, grade 12, and Isabella O'Brien, grade 12, and all members of the varsity and junior varsity teams.

290
00:24:21,092 --> 00:24:32,800
For the winter athletic season, our teams are off to a great start, and we're proudly cheering on our basketball, swimming, track, hockey, and gymnastics teams.

291
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:46,090
Also another critically important announcement, our CPAC team, there will be a special CPAC workshop and upcoming tiered focus monitoring review.

292
00:24:47,471 --> 00:24:56,980
Please consider joining the Medford CPAC's parent workshop on executive functioning to be held by Zoom at 6 p.m.

293
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,881
on Wednesday of this week.

294
00:24:59,902 --> 00:25:17,047
Mass General Hospital Inclusion Specialist, Elise Wolf, will discuss concrete strategies parents and caregivers can apply to help teach and foster independence for neurodiverse students at home and in the community.

295
00:25:18,127 --> 00:25:22,429
More information is available on the Medford Public Schools website.

296
00:25:24,009 --> 00:25:26,250
Also, a very important update.

297
00:25:28,191 --> 00:25:34,019
This is related to our special education triennial tiered focus monitoring review.

298
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:43,612
This is taking place during the week of January, 29, the department the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education desi.

299
00:25:44,893 --> 00:25:48,775
Office of Public School Monitoring, PSM.

300
00:25:49,436 --> 00:25:55,279
They will be conducting a review of Medford Public Schools special education programming.

301
00:25:56,139 --> 00:26:11,067
DESE visits each public school in Massachusetts every three years to monitor compliance with federal and state special education and civil rights regulations.

302
00:26:12,168 --> 00:26:18,231
In addition to the on-site visit, parent outreach is an important part of the review process.

303
00:26:19,051 --> 00:26:35,178
The review chairperson from the Office of Public School Monitoring will send all parents of students with disabilities an online survey that focuses on key areas of their child's special education program.

304
00:26:36,719 --> 00:26:40,841
Survey results will contribute to the development of a report.

305
00:26:43,012 --> 00:26:52,815
And if caregivers would like to contact the review chairperson to arrange an interview, contact information is also available on our website.

306
00:26:54,436 --> 00:27:08,541
The Medford Special Education Parent Advisory Council, CPAC, will host a caregiver orientation to learn about the upcoming special education and civil rights review in our district.

307
00:27:09,537 --> 00:27:19,483
The Caregiver Orientation will be held on Tuesday, January 16 next week at 6.30pm by Zoom.

308
00:27:20,243 --> 00:27:21,264
Please join us.

309
00:27:25,626 --> 00:27:28,787
There are a few upcoming events this week.

310
00:27:30,047 --> 00:27:40,611
January 10 Wednesday is early release day for all students, middle schools release at 1130 and all other schools release at noon.

311
00:27:42,191 --> 00:27:42,812
On January 14.

312
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:54,805
which is Sunday, it'll be the fifth annual Tufts Classic Medford against Somerville basketball games.

313
00:27:55,225 --> 00:27:57,346
That will be starting at 12 noon.

314
00:27:58,466 --> 00:28:06,550
And on Monday, January 15th, there will be no school in honor of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

315
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:06,810

316
00:28:07,971 --> 00:28:09,092
So tonight's meeting,

317
00:28:09,992 --> 00:28:17,423
This evening's meeting will cover a variety of important topics, including a presentation from a recent Medford graduate.

318
00:28:18,601 --> 00:28:24,423
an update on the Roberts Elementary School from our wonderful new principal, Ms.

319
00:28:24,463 --> 00:28:31,745
Michelle Crowell, and a discussion on the school calendar for the school year beginning next September.

320
00:28:32,565 --> 00:28:44,949
I'm also looking forward to providing an update on my superintendent goals for the current year and recommending the approval of several generous donations to the Medford Public Schools.

321
00:28:45,469 --> 00:28:46,970
Thank you for your patience this evening.

322
00:28:48,168 --> 00:28:49,329
Thank you, Dr. Edward Vincent.

323
00:28:49,649 --> 00:28:49,889
Mayor?

324
00:28:50,289 --> 00:28:51,029
Member McLaughlin.

325
00:28:51,129 --> 00:28:51,449
Thank you.

326
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:53,750
Thank you, Dr. Edward Vincent.

327
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:57,552
I had a question about the public school monitoring.

328
00:28:58,893 --> 00:29:05,876
I know it said that all families of students with disabilities will be contacted with that information.

329
00:29:06,236 --> 00:29:07,336
How are they being contacted?

330
00:29:08,897 --> 00:29:09,077
Ms.

331
00:29:09,117 --> 00:29:10,498
Bowen, can you please come forward?

332
00:29:10,538 --> 00:29:10,858
Thank you.

333
00:29:22,078 --> 00:29:22,418
Is it on.

334
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:22,799
Okay.

335
00:29:23,379 --> 00:29:34,973
Yes, so we had to provide Jesse with a roster of all students with disabilities, and they'll be contacted via email we were only allowed to provide one parent name and one parent email.

336
00:29:35,433 --> 00:29:36,755
Those went out last week.

337
00:29:37,175 --> 00:29:42,161
If you don't receive them I'm asking parents to contact me or you can contact

338
00:29:42,521 --> 00:29:53,084
The desi program reviewer Joan Birkenhoff, who, her information is listed on our website with the update regarding the tiered focus monitoring visit.

339
00:29:53,904 --> 00:29:54,305
Thank you.

340
00:29:54,425 --> 00:30:01,587
And so to be clear, it's parent email, not through the students portal or school directly to the parents email.

341
00:30:01,707 --> 00:30:01,967
Yes.

342
00:30:03,427 --> 00:30:04,128
Thank you.

343
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:12,110
We have number two leadership for social change pre college program accessibility to

344
00:30:12,472 --> 00:30:14,254
Performing Arts, Ms.

345
00:30:14,294 --> 00:30:16,576
Tegan The Stone, MHS graduate from 2023.

346
00:30:16,696 --> 00:30:17,497
Welcome, Tegan.

347
00:30:18,959 --> 00:30:20,060
Thank you for having me.

348
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:21,101
Yes.

349
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:25,725
Well, I was going to mention that, but yes, I am a graduate from this June, so not too long.

350
00:30:26,446 --> 00:30:32,292
But good evening, mayor, superintendent, school committee members, school administrators, and committee members joining us from Zoom.

351
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:36,363
My name is Tegan Westone, and I'm a graduate from the Medford High School class of 2023.

352
00:30:36,863 --> 00:30:42,468
Thank you for making time for me tonight to shine a light on accessibility to the arts in Medford Public Schools.

353
00:30:43,749 --> 00:30:49,554
So a year and a half ago, I attended a lovely Tufts pre-college program entitled Leadership for Social Change.

354
00:30:50,115 --> 00:30:59,963
And at this two-week program in July, I attended classes and lectures by Tufts professors focused on coalition building, social barriers, and of course, community activism.

355
00:31:01,274 --> 00:31:07,416
This is all thanks to the generosity of Marilyn Blumstack and each year she supports a Medford student with a scholarship to this program.

356
00:31:07,897 --> 00:31:13,419
She's a true agent of change in our community and responsible for cultivating a more civically minded student body.

357
00:31:13,899 --> 00:31:16,240
And luckily she and her granddaughter are here tonight.

358
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:17,580
So just give her a round of applause.

359
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,140
Thank you.

360
00:31:25,734 --> 00:31:33,075
So over the course of the program, I created an action plan with the guide of the directors to address an issue in my own community of my choosing.

361
00:31:33,675 --> 00:31:40,056
I decided to focus on a place I knew very well, classroom A125, the music room of Medford High School.

362
00:31:40,597 --> 00:31:45,998
My project targeted increasing accessibility to the performing arts with the focus of the marching band and concert band.

363
00:31:46,838 --> 00:31:54,399
One of the lessons of the pre-college program was an asset-based approach, harnessing the resources in the community to create a sustainable social change.

364
00:31:55,472 --> 00:31:58,834
The Medford arts community was already home to passionate and hardworking students.

365
00:31:59,575 --> 00:32:03,297
And I knew that effective change would not be possible without their vision and determination.

366
00:32:05,198 --> 00:32:11,502
One element of this initiative that I'd like to point out is an elementary and middle school music camp during February break and summer vacation.

367
00:32:12,342 --> 00:32:19,607
These camps were offered completely free of charge to the Medford public school students, thanks to the hard work of the music band and orchestra teachers of this district.

368
00:32:20,589 --> 00:32:23,310
They're also possible because of the vision and determination of Ms.

369
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:26,772
Haley Rallo, the band director, one of my role models and biggest supporters.

370
00:32:28,052 --> 00:32:31,334
In addition, the camps were run by dozens of high school student volunteers.

371
00:32:32,074 --> 00:32:36,917
The upperclassmen made these camps exciting by sharing the love of music and giving personal attention to students.

372
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:46,441
The best part of the performance at the end of each camp was seeing a stage full of students from all different schools, backgrounds, and social classes playing together in harmony.

373
00:32:47,571 --> 00:32:54,093
The umbrella of performing arts also includes the drama club, choir, and percussion ensemble that were once a part of the vibrant MHS community.

374
00:32:54,953 --> 00:33:01,635
I believe that reestablishing these programs in post-COVID times are important by hiring more music and arts teachers.

375
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:05,516
And this should be a priority for the next fiscal year, if I might ask.

376
00:33:06,451 --> 00:33:09,834
I also understand the importance of a dedicated and full-time staff to music programs.

377
00:33:10,515 --> 00:33:12,837
Currently, the only paid staff for the marching band are Ms.

378
00:33:12,857 --> 00:33:13,637
Haley Rallo and Ms.

379
00:33:13,677 --> 00:33:14,298
Jackie Gaffney.

380
00:33:15,138 --> 00:33:20,383
This past season, five recent high school graduates joined the staff as volunteers to lead the percussion staff.

381
00:33:21,324 --> 00:33:25,948
And I believe going forward, all who put time and effort to this program deserve a stipend, if only small.

382
00:33:26,929 --> 00:33:30,972
Despite all odds, the marching band took first place in New England Regional Competition in 2023,

383
00:33:32,389 --> 00:33:35,090
And this season marked a new chapter of the performing arts in Medford.

384
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:38,871
It was more diverse, more welcoming, and more powerful than ever.

385
00:33:39,712 --> 00:33:42,353
I hope that you will continue this momentum and help the marching band.

386
00:33:43,193 --> 00:33:45,234
And before I end, I would like to especially thank Ms.

387
00:33:45,254 --> 00:33:50,136
Stacey Schulman, the director of school counseling and behavioral health, for her assistance and leadership through this program.

388
00:33:50,776 --> 00:33:55,538
Thank you for having me tonight, and I look forward to another successful year in the performing arts open for all students.

389
00:33:56,338 --> 00:33:56,598
Thank you.

390
00:34:04,232 --> 00:34:10,517
I want to say thank you so much again for coming back to share your report with us.

391
00:34:11,398 --> 00:34:23,469
Would you mind, and I want to just once again thank Miss Marilyn bloom sack for your generosity, your partnership your collaboration with the Medford public schools, and you're continuing to do it.

392
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:26,892
This presentation that I didn't say at the beginning.

393
00:34:27,552 --> 00:34:31,958
is a little deferred because you are out of the country.

394
00:34:31,998 --> 00:34:36,663
Would you mind sharing with the committee your wonderful learning experience?

395
00:34:36,923 --> 00:34:38,225
I definitely can.

396
00:34:38,245 --> 00:34:46,675
So this program opened my eyes to Tufts and how powerful it is to our community, especially because I'm a, I would say I'm a Medford resident first, a Tufts student second.

397
00:34:47,208 --> 00:34:56,493
And this year was my first semester at Tufts, and I went abroad to Peru, which is a part of Tisch College, which is the umbrella that this program, Leadership for Social Change, is also directed under.

398
00:34:56,893 --> 00:35:01,995
So not only had I known some of the staff when I went away for my first semester at Tufts, thanks to Ms.

399
00:35:02,075 --> 00:35:07,098
Blumstack, but also I just had amazing civic-engaged experience abroad.

400
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:09,364
Thank you so much.

401
00:35:09,584 --> 00:35:11,965
And I just also wanted to say thank you again.

402
00:35:26,371 --> 00:35:30,713
student that's receiving this special scholarship to participate in this program.

403
00:35:31,013 --> 00:35:35,776
And we look forward to hearing her presentation at the end of the school year.

404
00:35:36,076 --> 00:35:39,918
But thank you, and thank you for sharing your wonderful learning with us.

405
00:35:43,479 --> 00:35:44,100
Thank you, thank you.

406
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:46,361
Thank you, Ms.

407
00:35:46,401 --> 00:35:46,841
Bonsack.

408
00:35:50,483 --> 00:35:52,203
We have our school update.

409
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:55,505
Roberts Elementary School Principal, Michelle Crow.

410
00:36:01,374 --> 00:36:01,614
Welcome.

411
00:36:04,256 --> 00:36:04,637
Thank you.

412
00:36:12,203 --> 00:36:12,663
All right.

413
00:36:12,983 --> 00:36:18,408
Thank you so much for having me here tonight to share the amazing happenings at the Roberts School.

414
00:36:20,574 --> 00:36:27,739
As I transitioned into the role of principal at the Roberts, we started the school year with a popsicles with the principal event.

415
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:39,328
This was an event that the entire Roberts School community was invited to, and it was an opportunity for me to meet with parents, caregivers, and students.

416
00:36:40,428 --> 00:36:47,093
With the help of my PTO, we purchased about 600 popsicles, which I thought was, wow, 600.

417
00:36:49,226 --> 00:36:54,570
Well, by 645, we had no more popsicles left.

418
00:36:55,891 --> 00:36:58,553
And at that point, I was like, this is it.

419
00:36:59,174 --> 00:37:00,595
The families were amazing.

420
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:02,476
This became a whole family event for me.

421
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:04,398
My husband was passing out popsicles.

422
00:37:04,478 --> 00:37:06,219
My boys were passing out popsicles.

423
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:12,004
As I walked around the playground and met our students and families.

424
00:37:12,224 --> 00:37:18,529
So our school year started off on a really positive note with this event that was held in the summer.

425
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:19,859
right at the playground.

426
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:31,482
As the school year started, we identified a set of four core values that directly related to responsive classroom.

427
00:37:32,582 --> 00:37:36,303
These core values are kind of what we live by at the Roberts School.

428
00:37:37,403 --> 00:37:39,083
We say them every single day.

429
00:37:39,743 --> 00:37:47,485
They're all around our school, and those words are be kind, be responsible, be respectful, and be safe.

430
00:37:48,888 --> 00:37:52,591
These core values are discussed during our daily morning meetings in our classrooms.

431
00:37:54,072 --> 00:38:01,417
They're posted in the hallways, they're posted in the cafeteria, they're posted in the main office, they're posted everywhere.

432
00:38:01,517 --> 00:38:09,023
And our kids know, and our kids talk about it, and they'll say, you are being so kind today, and I am being responsible.

433
00:38:09,884 --> 00:38:17,069
So the kids are getting it, and it's teaching them how to be responsible citizens.

434
00:38:18,638 --> 00:38:21,740
Additionally, we recite them every single day on our morning announcements.

435
00:38:25,904 --> 00:38:33,710
I'm super excited to kind of introduce to you a new initiative that is currently in full swing at the Roberts School right now.

436
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:37,052
It's our Schoolwide Mascot Symbol Project.

437
00:38:37,873 --> 00:38:44,198
This is a fully student-led project that has been incorporated into the students' weekly art classes.

438
00:38:45,427 --> 00:38:50,652
The students have been working with Miss Diorio, our art teacher, on learning about logos.

439
00:38:51,133 --> 00:38:53,295
So this project started with what is a logo?

440
00:38:54,232 --> 00:39:08,363
So she pulled various school logos, company logos, they looked at lettering, they looked at coloring, and students had to design a mascot or symbol that reflects our values as a school.

441
00:39:09,064 --> 00:39:16,810
So part of the assignment wasn't just to draw a symbol, but really, what does this symbol mean in relation to our values?

442
00:39:18,936 --> 00:39:23,278
We are now in the process of developing a teacher student committee.

443
00:39:24,258 --> 00:39:34,703
This committee will meet, we have hundreds of entries into this project, so our teacher and student committee will be meeting to

444
00:39:35,923 --> 00:39:37,606
narrow down our choices.

445
00:39:38,166 --> 00:39:40,630
Hopefully we can narrow down to a top five.

446
00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:48,440
This is going to go to a whole school wide assembly and students will be voting on the new mascot or symbol of the Robert school.

447
00:39:49,521 --> 00:39:49,621
Um,

448
00:39:50,672 --> 00:39:58,759
As you can see on this slide, this is a sneak peek of a few of our entries.

449
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:04,543
So our top right corner, this is one that a student drew.

450
00:40:04,563 --> 00:40:06,045
I believe this is a second grader.

451
00:40:06,725 --> 00:40:09,267
So their idea is the Robert School Gators.

452
00:40:09,868 --> 00:40:12,370
So in their research, they saw that a lot of symbols

453
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:17,353
kind of were in this circular shape with the illustration in the middle.

454
00:40:17,373 --> 00:40:21,015
So possibly we could be the Robert School Gators.

455
00:40:22,315 --> 00:40:26,538
The bottom left corner was the Robert School Lions.

456
00:40:26,958 --> 00:40:33,442
So this student in particular was really into color design, so super colorful on the mane of the lion.

457
00:40:34,847 --> 00:40:39,648
In the bottom right corner, there's a few of these lingering around the Roberts School.

458
00:40:39,668 --> 00:40:44,729
The Roberts School goats, because the Roberts School is the greatest school of all time.

459
00:40:44,909 --> 00:40:57,911
So these are just a sneak peek of what we've got, and hopefully it will go to a school-wide vote sometime in February.

460
00:40:58,651 --> 00:41:03,952
The next new addition to the Roberts School this year have been student-led morning announcements.

461
00:41:05,023 --> 00:41:10,908
Every day, students in grades K through five have the opportunity to lead the announcements.

462
00:41:12,549 --> 00:41:22,236
During this time, students will say the Pledge of Allegiance, they share important announcements, present the lunch menu, various fun facts, guess the state, joke of the day.

463
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:27,821
This has become such an exciting part of the day.

464
00:41:28,841 --> 00:41:31,864
Kids keep me on my toes, so usually I do the announcements about 8.45.

465
00:41:31,944 --> 00:41:32,924
If I'm at 8.46, where's Mrs. Kroll?

466
00:41:35,875 --> 00:41:40,901
Because they're so excited to see who is going to be doing the morning announcements for the day.

467
00:41:41,922 --> 00:41:46,727
It's been pretty fantastic to see the student growth throughout the year so far.

468
00:41:47,208 --> 00:41:54,396
So when we started with the student-led morning announcements, we started with fifth grade, we went down to fourth, third, two, one.

469
00:41:55,034 --> 00:41:57,396
K, so our earliest readers.

470
00:41:58,096 --> 00:42:03,040
When we got to kindergarten, they had seen and heard the models of their peers in the school.

471
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:06,482
They also kind of knew some of the things that just always stay.

472
00:42:06,622 --> 00:42:08,544
So like, good morning, Robert School.

473
00:42:09,765 --> 00:42:11,206
Please stand for the Pledge of Allegiance.

474
00:42:11,266 --> 00:42:12,466
So they knew the Pledge of Allegiance.

475
00:42:12,506 --> 00:42:15,409
Then we always do, please stand for a moment of personal thought.

476
00:42:16,369 --> 00:42:16,850
Thank you.

477
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:18,991
So they knew all of these parts.

478
00:42:19,071 --> 00:42:21,733
So our kindergartners got right involved in the rotation.

479
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:30,779
And it's also been pretty interesting to see how kids are applying what they're learning in their literacy class into their oral reading.

480
00:42:31,448 --> 00:42:40,670
perfect example, when we got to our grade two rotation, my second graders were the most excited students when they were doing their morning announcements.

481
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:44,571
So the students would say, good morning, Robert school.

482
00:42:45,192 --> 00:42:48,812
Today is pajama day, super excited.

483
00:42:49,453 --> 00:42:55,734
So I said to my second grade teachers, wow, your students are reading with such emotion.

484
00:42:55,754 --> 00:42:58,355
And they said, yes, because we're doing our unit on exclamation points.

485
00:42:58,855 --> 00:43:06,880
So students were taking what they were learning in the classroom and applying it directly to real life situations within our school.

486
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:07,861
It was fantastic.

487
00:43:11,663 --> 00:43:20,749
Another new thing, new to the Roberts School, Mr. DiClemente and I have started responsive classroom whole grade assemblies.

488
00:43:21,977 --> 00:43:29,078
We run three 45-minute assemblies per month, and this focuses directly on the real-life application of our core values.

489
00:43:30,059 --> 00:43:36,940
So our teachers are teaching about core values, and Mr. D. Kalente and I are really teaching them, like, how do we actually put that into practice?

490
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:47,742
In September, we focused on what is kindness and identified the importance of inclusion and kindness at school and in their daily lives.

491
00:43:48,945 --> 00:43:51,887
We read the book, We're All Wonders by RJ Palacio.

492
00:43:52,868 --> 00:43:58,392
Students had the opportunity to turn and talk with their peers, and then they shared out.

493
00:43:58,572 --> 00:44:10,841
So we provided the students with the sentence starter, so I can be kind by, and then they talked about asking a friend to play on the playground, but they were making that connection about kindness and how do they actually be kind.

494
00:44:12,648 --> 00:44:14,749
October is National Bullying Prevention Month.

495
00:44:15,229 --> 00:44:25,515
So during our responsive classroom assembly, we continued our discussion on kindness, but with a focus on being an upstander instead of a bystander, if they see bullying occur.

496
00:44:26,255 --> 00:44:31,118
We then played a game where students focused on what is alike with their peers.

497
00:44:31,138 --> 00:44:33,159
So we played a game called Find Someone Who.

498
00:44:35,478 --> 00:44:46,924
The November responsive classroom assembly, we continued to discuss bullying, but we also did a super fantastic activity about spreading kindness like confetti around school.

499
00:44:48,105 --> 00:44:55,109
Each student received a colored sticky note and wrote messages of positivity for students around the school and for staff.

500
00:44:56,269 --> 00:45:04,674
They left the sticky notes on lockers, in the teacher's room, in the nurse's office, and students found them as the day went on.

501
00:45:07,957 --> 00:45:11,820
Our next slide just kind of shows our red box.

502
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:16,002
This is me working with some first graders where they're presenting out to their grade level.

503
00:45:17,123 --> 00:45:21,166
The middle box is Mr. D. Clemente reading to a group of fifth graders.

504
00:45:22,086 --> 00:45:29,271
In this particular assembly, we were talking about what is it like to make sure that our peers are feeling included in a sense of belonging in everything that we do.

505
00:45:30,393 --> 00:45:36,139
And then our brown box are some of the sticky notes, the spreading kindness.

506
00:45:36,239 --> 00:45:40,864
I know it can be hard to read, but I've got a couple for you.

507
00:45:41,545 --> 00:45:43,607
Again, kids didn't do any research here.

508
00:45:43,647 --> 00:45:46,770
This was just their thoughts on kindness.

509
00:45:47,491 --> 00:45:48,832
You brighten my day.

510
00:45:50,094 --> 00:45:51,075
You are awesome.

511
00:45:52,196 --> 00:45:52,977
Keep smiling.

512
00:45:53,857 --> 00:45:57,322
And this last one I found outside of a kindergarten classroom.

513
00:45:57,743 --> 00:46:03,833
And the student wrote, let your smile change the world, but don't let the world change your smile.

514
00:46:04,730 --> 00:46:08,671
So throughout the school, kids found these all over.

515
00:46:08,691 --> 00:46:17,073
And it truly brought a sense of just overwhelming happiness across the school.

516
00:46:17,193 --> 00:46:19,134
Kids, you know, did you get a sticky note?

517
00:46:19,214 --> 00:46:20,474
Did you see this sticky note?

518
00:46:20,534 --> 00:46:21,834
Mine said I was awesome.

519
00:46:22,715 --> 00:46:24,375
And they were given by their peers.

520
00:46:24,395 --> 00:46:27,496
So this was a fantastic activity that we completed.

521
00:46:30,359 --> 00:46:36,624
Continuing on with the theme of kindness, I wanna highlight the amazing work of my fifth grade student council members.

522
00:46:38,005 --> 00:46:41,428
All fifth grade students have the opportunity to sign up for student council.

523
00:46:42,649 --> 00:46:47,013
Student council meetings take place once a week on Thursdays during the school day.

524
00:46:48,514 --> 00:46:54,839
Every month they organize one civic or community learning project and one school-wide theme day.

525
00:46:56,095 --> 00:47:00,018
All community projects and theme days are totally determined by the students.

526
00:47:00,578 --> 00:47:07,203
So at our meeting, we talk about what are some of the things that we can do to give back to our own school or to the city of Medford.

527
00:47:08,244 --> 00:47:11,766
And then what kind of fun theme day can we do throughout the month?

528
00:47:13,167 --> 00:47:21,253
The students are responsible for organizing the activity and communicating to the entire school community through posters and after school announcements.

529
00:47:23,143 --> 00:47:27,284
Attending student council meetings have been the highlight of my day.

530
00:47:27,965 --> 00:47:32,906
So in my calendar, this is a weekly meeting that I have set in my calendar every Thursday at 11 o'clock.

531
00:47:33,807 --> 00:47:44,190
I actually tend not as the principal of the Roberts, but I am the support staff for the students in my connections program that have signed up to be on my student council.

532
00:47:45,210 --> 00:47:52,713
And being able to participate with these group of kids has been amazing.

533
00:47:53,442 --> 00:47:59,424
The thoughts that they have about how to give back to our community are on point.

534
00:48:00,104 --> 00:48:03,446
They know, they know how to be kind and they know where the need is.

535
00:48:04,226 --> 00:48:06,687
And so they're coming up with fantastic ideas.

536
00:48:06,747 --> 00:48:15,710
So we're still determining our January community project and our theme day, but I can tell you they're already super impressive on some of the ideas that they have.

537
00:48:16,932 --> 00:48:17,813
A few examples.

538
00:48:18,414 --> 00:48:22,058
During the month of October and November, students at the Roberts organized a food drive.

539
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:26,344
Students decorated the boxes, they delivered everything to classrooms.

540
00:48:27,024 --> 00:48:31,169
During weekly meetings, students collected the donations, packaged them up for delivery.

541
00:48:31,830 --> 00:48:35,334
And prior to Thanksgiving, the Roberts delivered a generous amount of food to St.

542
00:48:35,395 --> 00:48:36,516
Raphael's Food Pantry.

543
00:48:37,861 --> 00:48:43,364
During the month of December, our students decorated ornaments and made cards for Medford senior citizens.

544
00:48:44,025 --> 00:48:50,368
The cards and ornaments were wrapped in wrapping paper and bows and delivered to the Courtyard Nursing Care Center.

545
00:48:53,370 --> 00:48:57,933
Our theme days, these are just two examples of the theme days that the school has organized.

546
00:48:57,973 --> 00:49:01,815
We had a sports day, pajama day, crazy mixed up day.

547
00:49:02,235 --> 00:49:06,438
Again, they're just fun themes that the students organized for the kids.

548
00:49:10,586 --> 00:49:16,929
I want to highlight the work of Kathleen Keehan and her staff for running the Roberts School Afterschool Program.

549
00:49:17,669 --> 00:49:22,632
In December, students in our afterschool program had the opportunity to work with Ms.

550
00:49:22,652 --> 00:49:24,733
Susan Altman on a mosaic project.

551
00:49:25,593 --> 00:49:28,155
All of the materials the students used were recycled.

552
00:49:29,095 --> 00:49:39,280
Each student planned how they wanted their mosaic to look before completing their final design, and the students' creations will be added to a quilt made entirely of recycled materials.

553
00:49:40,827 --> 00:49:42,008
Beautiful project.

554
00:49:43,028 --> 00:49:47,672
I attended the day that they made these and they're like, Mrs. Pearl, what do you see here?

555
00:49:48,373 --> 00:49:55,759
And they had their little mosaics and like, it's a river with trees and a sun and they put so much work into these mosaics.

556
00:49:55,819 --> 00:49:57,360
They came out fantastic.

557
00:49:57,420 --> 00:50:01,063
And I really wanted to highlight the work that they're doing in our afterschool program.

558
00:50:03,277 --> 00:50:13,342
I also wanted to highlight math and science and action at the Roberts School and the incredible work of the teachers who are implementing project-based learning into their classrooms.

559
00:50:14,642 --> 00:50:38,972
To finish up the what is all around us unit grade one students sent parachutes flying down the main lobby of the Robert school that's in our blue box, they stood up on the second floor, they designed the prototype for their parachute they dropped them the kiddos that are sitting on the floor practice observational skills they wrote what they saw how the prototype worked.

560
00:50:39,758 --> 00:50:47,044
Fantastic, super, lots of excitement this day as students were dropping their parachutes down one floor.

561
00:50:48,705 --> 00:50:51,747
In my green box, I have grade four measurement and data.

562
00:50:52,408 --> 00:50:55,610
Grade four students have been generating and describing measurement data.

563
00:50:56,901 --> 00:51:00,342
groups of students work together to create their own data projects.

564
00:51:01,322 --> 00:51:06,884
They collected measurement data, they determined what materials they would need and conducted their own investigations.

565
00:51:07,604 --> 00:51:14,106
They then turned all of their information into posters in which they presented to their classmates.

566
00:51:15,151 --> 00:51:19,253
And lastly, in my pink box, this was my grade two tower building challenge.

567
00:51:19,833 --> 00:51:25,676
Second grade students, they put their knowledge of properties of different solids to the test by constructing towers.

568
00:51:26,396 --> 00:51:33,540
The challenge was to build a tower that stood at least 45 centimeters tall and was stable enough to sustain wind.

569
00:51:38,510 --> 00:51:47,320
The third, fourth, and fifth grade at the Roberts had an out-of-this-world experience, thanks to the PTO, who sponsored Sky Dome Planetarium.

570
00:51:48,081 --> 00:51:50,724
They visited the Roberts School on December 20th.

571
00:51:51,424 --> 00:51:58,572
If you look at the photos here, they brought this gigantic silver dome in which the students entered through a tunnel.

572
00:52:00,287 --> 00:52:07,290
They experienced a star-filled sky, so they sat around in the center of the dome.

573
00:52:08,150 --> 00:52:09,190
There was a projector.

574
00:52:09,530 --> 00:52:13,172
The presenter taught the kids about the stars, the planets.

575
00:52:14,052 --> 00:52:16,393
There were rocket ships that launched.

576
00:52:17,493 --> 00:52:19,474
Amazing experience.

577
00:52:19,534 --> 00:52:27,057
The kids loved it, the staff loved it, and really kind of brought some hands-on learning and some practical

578
00:52:28,856 --> 00:52:30,590
science work right into our gymnasium.

579
00:52:34,132 --> 00:52:43,940
I quickly want to give a shout out to Miss Kelly Malloy and Jimmy Giddings, who have been approved for Medford Education Foundation grants.

580
00:52:44,901 --> 00:52:55,409
Miss Kelly Malloy received a $1,500 grant to buy Botley coding robots and Dash coding robots to be utilized during our technology time.

581
00:52:56,170 --> 00:53:01,254
And this will be to teach students coding within that block of time for students in grades K through five.

582
00:53:02,438 --> 00:53:07,082
The Botley robots are like hands-on robots where they can press buttons on the device.

583
00:53:07,162 --> 00:53:10,605
The Botley robot is the one that has three circles.

584
00:53:12,086 --> 00:53:16,090
You press the buttons and then you can code where you want this robot to go.

585
00:53:19,433 --> 00:53:22,195
And the other, the Dash robots are more on a platform.

586
00:53:22,215 --> 00:53:26,639
So they go onto a computer program and they learn how to code through an online platform.

587
00:53:27,426 --> 00:53:37,335
Mr. Jimmy Giddings is a kindergarten teacher at the Roberts School, and he received a grant of 250 to purchase furniture and materials for a calming corner for our kindergarten students.

588
00:53:38,015 --> 00:53:49,786
And this is just gonna be a spot where students, when they're just feeling like they just need a minute to kind of sit and step away and just take a deep breath, putting together this little calming corner within the classroom.

589
00:53:50,166 --> 00:53:54,490
So I wanted to congratulate Kelly and Jimmy for their hard work in writing these grants.

590
00:53:57,606 --> 00:54:02,671
Um, I wanted to just talk about my walking school bus in October.

591
00:54:03,192 --> 00:54:14,362
This was on each Wednesday in the month of October the Robert school participated in walking Wednesday, each of the Wednesdays had a fun theme to encourage students to walk or bike to school.

592
00:54:15,183 --> 00:54:18,704
On October 4th, this was kind of the kickoff event.

593
00:54:18,904 --> 00:54:22,085
It was Neon and Rainbow Day, which was one of my favorites.

594
00:54:22,165 --> 00:54:27,547
And yes, those are my socks that you see there with the turquoise shoes and the pink tutu.

595
00:54:27,587 --> 00:54:28,267
That was me.

596
00:54:28,287 --> 00:54:31,008
It was a fantastic event.

597
00:54:31,048 --> 00:54:32,389
We had a great turnout.

598
00:54:33,469 --> 00:54:38,711
Other themes were wear your Robert school gear, your Mustang blue or white.

599
00:54:39,291 --> 00:54:43,953
Class Day, where students with the most participation won the Golden Sneaker Award.

600
00:54:44,894 --> 00:54:46,137
and Wacky Hat Day.

601
00:54:46,157 --> 00:54:52,494
I just wanted to thank Sarah Reinfeld who worked so hard to make Walking School Bus such a success at the Roberts.

602
00:54:55,275 --> 00:54:59,558
The Roberts Elementary girls on the run team had another great season.

603
00:54:59,878 --> 00:55:04,300
Approximately 50 girls participate during the fall and spring season.

604
00:55:05,221 --> 00:55:12,965
They joined 70 teams in 1600 girls from the greater Boston area in a 5K at Suffolk Downs.

605
00:55:13,426 --> 00:55:18,829
The girls had so much fun and made lifelong friends with their teammates and classmates.

606
00:55:19,329 --> 00:55:20,890
Such a fantastic.

607
00:55:21,930 --> 00:55:23,011
Such a fantastic program.

608
00:55:23,945 --> 00:55:27,726
Is it too early to tell you that I'm doing a boys on the right track team for the spring?

609
00:55:28,306 --> 00:55:29,687
Oh, fantastic.

610
00:55:29,727 --> 00:55:35,628
So that will be in my next update.

611
00:55:36,168 --> 00:55:36,809
Great.

612
00:55:37,229 --> 00:55:45,271
And just lastly, and I wanted to put this on because I know there was lots of excitement about our new playground equipment.

613
00:55:46,291 --> 00:55:55,317
So we finally have our new playground equipment, our bouncy bridge, our cargo net and canyon bridge are repaired, along with our kindergarten spinners on the structure.

614
00:55:56,157 --> 00:56:04,862
The students were so excited when they saw the repair workers come with all of their materials.

615
00:56:05,342 --> 00:56:05,903
It was like,

616
00:56:07,222 --> 00:56:08,363
The kids were super excited.

617
00:56:08,603 --> 00:56:10,304
Oh my gosh, what's going on?

618
00:56:11,484 --> 00:56:13,505
They're utilized every single day.

619
00:56:13,825 --> 00:56:21,689
The kids love it and I just wanted to give a shout out and a thank you to the Medford Community Preservation Commission for making sure that this project gets completed.

620
00:56:23,230 --> 00:56:24,151
Wonderful, thank you.

621
00:56:24,251 --> 00:56:24,831
Thank you.

622
00:56:25,592 --> 00:56:26,292
Member McLaughlin.

623
00:56:27,513 --> 00:56:27,873
Thank you.

624
00:56:27,913 --> 00:56:28,833
Thank you, Principal Kroll.

625
00:56:28,853 --> 00:56:32,755
That was really helpful and the Roberts is such a great school.

626
00:56:32,815 --> 00:56:35,777
It's awesome to hear all the things the students are doing and makes me

627
00:56:36,696 --> 00:56:40,358
back to elementary school, or go back into education.

628
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:44,581
I just had a couple of questions in mind.

629
00:56:44,801 --> 00:56:47,663
I was just actually trying to look on my phone and it wasn't coming up easily enough.

630
00:56:47,683 --> 00:56:56,009
So I figured I could ask you, can you share, especially, you know, not just with us, but the community that's watching and others, what the demographics are for your school?

631
00:56:56,508 --> 00:57:05,615
Sure, so we currently have about 571 students, this was based on my October one sims I think right now i'm at like 575 ish.

632
00:57:05,635 --> 00:57:10,418
I have about 8.9% on el students, which I think roughly is about 5050 students.

633
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:20,201
Students with disabilities and at 19.4%.

634
00:57:21,702 --> 00:57:24,703
So I think that brings me to about 110.

635
00:57:24,883 --> 00:57:26,224
Again, this was from October.

636
00:57:26,284 --> 00:57:28,285
I'm definitely a little bit higher than that right now.

637
00:57:29,525 --> 00:57:31,766
We do house the Connections Program.

638
00:57:32,907 --> 00:57:34,528
Can you tell us what the Connections Program is?

639
00:57:34,568 --> 00:57:40,511
Yeah, the Connections Program is the district-wide program for students with autism.

640
00:57:41,311 --> 00:57:47,334
We have a program for kindergarten through grade five, and we currently have 28 students in our program.

641
00:57:48,466 --> 00:57:53,029
with two or three that may be entering shortly.

642
00:57:53,829 --> 00:58:01,173
And the 28 students over the K through five, just, can you explain how that can work in terms of, you know, students are grouped together?

643
00:58:01,473 --> 00:58:15,301
Sure, so right now, due to numbers, my kindergarten and grade one students are grouped together, and then I have a full grade two group, because they're the largest group, and then my third, fourth, and fifth graders are grouped together.

644
00:58:16,203 --> 00:58:16,603
Thank you.

645
00:58:16,783 --> 00:58:18,424
You're welcome.

646
00:58:18,524 --> 00:58:21,786
And then for the 8.9% EL, is that a newcomer program?

647
00:58:21,866 --> 00:58:23,247
It is not a newcomer program.

648
00:58:23,587 --> 00:58:28,870
So after they leave the newcomer program, they can come back to the Roberts and they receive the EL instruction.

649
00:58:28,910 --> 00:58:35,813
I have two full-time EL teachers that support through a combination of pull-out services and push-in services.

650
00:58:36,113 --> 00:58:36,734
Okay, thank you.

651
00:58:36,794 --> 00:58:39,035
And then economically disadvantaged?

652
00:58:39,475 --> 00:58:41,216
Economically disadvantaged, 28.4%.

653
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:47,781
Thank you.

654
00:58:47,801 --> 00:58:48,961
You're welcome.

655
00:58:49,181 --> 00:58:49,722
May I, may I?

656
00:58:49,742 --> 00:58:50,502
I just had a couple more.

657
00:58:51,142 --> 00:58:51,483
Thank you.

658
00:58:51,563 --> 00:59:07,392
And then, so for the responsive classroom, which, you know, I know is a great program and I love the emphasis on inclusion and kindness, which I think are so needed in our world in so many ways today.

659
00:59:08,353 --> 00:59:10,014
And I'm wondering how that is,

660
00:59:11,257 --> 00:59:14,139
differentiated for your 19.4% and your 8.9% so you're 110 and 50 160 students.

661
00:59:14,159 --> 00:59:15,500
That are both neuro diverse and.

662
00:59:23,857 --> 00:59:24,578
different languages.

663
00:59:24,738 --> 00:59:25,018
Sure.

664
00:59:25,238 --> 00:59:28,320
So, um, many different ways.

665
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:33,964
So I think that some of the things that we are doing is not only are they getting this presentation.

666
00:59:34,024 --> 00:59:39,667
So if we're pulling, if we're doing a whole great assembly, there's also lots of work that are being done in the classroom.

667
00:59:39,727 --> 00:59:46,852
So making it that it's really super great appropriate, um, really kind of pulling out these key vocabulary words for them.

668
00:59:46,912 --> 00:59:48,233
So when we talk about kindness,

669
00:59:49,594 --> 00:59:50,897
What does kindness actually look like?

670
00:59:50,957 --> 00:59:52,140
So what does it actually look like?

671
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:54,204
And what does kindness actually sound like?

672
00:59:54,545 --> 00:59:56,008
And that's some of the work that we're doing.

673
00:59:56,028 --> 00:59:59,055
Because we can say kindness, we need to be kind.

674
01:00:00,103 --> 01:00:01,765
And for some kids are like, yep, I've heard that.

675
01:00:02,105 --> 01:00:04,307
And there's all kinds of t-shirts that say, be kind.

676
01:00:04,347 --> 01:00:05,208
And they're seeing that.

677
01:00:05,228 --> 01:00:06,950
And they know like, that means that we have to be nice.

678
01:00:07,110 --> 01:00:09,152
But how do we actually apply that?

679
01:00:09,192 --> 01:00:11,455
So we're doing lots of, this is what it looks like.

680
01:00:12,216 --> 01:00:14,538
And this is what kindness actually sounds like.

681
01:00:15,519 --> 01:00:19,023
So we're breaking that down for them in many different settings.

682
01:00:19,043 --> 01:00:22,086
So have it be in a whole group setting, but then in also that small group setting.

683
01:00:22,486 --> 01:00:33,873
A lot of our kiddos are also, not only are they getting that whole group assembly, but for some kids, they're getting just pushed in for that morning meeting time with the classroom teachers.

684
01:00:34,013 --> 01:00:49,303
So there's within that block, lots of differentiation that's going on just specifically regarding the responsive classroom and the core values and breaking it down into kid-friendly language through the responsive classroom curriculum.

685
01:00:49,943 --> 01:00:50,243
Thank you.

686
01:00:50,603 --> 01:00:52,265
And recess and lunch are integrated?

687
01:00:52,285 --> 01:00:52,265
100%.

688
01:00:52,765 --> 01:00:53,846
Awesome.

689
01:00:54,306 --> 01:00:56,728
And then two more questions.

690
01:00:56,828 --> 01:01:00,090
What do you, what do you, it's awesome hearing all the wonderful things.

691
01:01:00,631 --> 01:01:01,852
And I know this is your first year.

692
01:01:02,252 --> 01:01:02,913
Welcome to MET.

693
01:01:03,253 --> 01:01:03,773
Thank you.

694
01:01:03,793 --> 01:01:05,074
We're super excited to have you.

695
01:01:05,294 --> 01:01:09,057
I've heard really great things from your colleagues from previous places.

696
01:01:09,157 --> 01:01:10,358
So I'm really excited that.

697
01:01:11,231 --> 01:01:16,252
You're here, and I'm sure you've gotten thrown right into it, which is always the best way, right?

698
01:01:16,272 --> 01:01:16,913
You learn right away.

699
01:01:18,493 --> 01:01:22,374
So I loved that you were talking about the connection students being part of the student council.

700
01:01:22,614 --> 01:01:24,115
I just wanted to comment on that as well.

701
01:01:24,135 --> 01:01:27,416
But what is it that you feel like you need?

702
01:01:27,976 --> 01:01:31,137
We're hearing all the great things about our elementary schools, which we want to hear.

703
01:01:31,877 --> 01:01:34,798
But it's also really important for us to understand what is it that you need?

704
01:01:34,838 --> 01:01:35,818
Are you fully staffed?

705
01:01:35,878 --> 01:01:38,599
Is your building operating well?

706
01:01:38,659 --> 01:01:39,759
You know, sort of those things.

707
01:01:40,694 --> 01:01:42,115
how we can help them, what it is you need.

708
01:01:42,495 --> 01:01:42,775
Sure.

709
01:01:42,835 --> 01:01:57,766
So I think that for the first time, you know, as I have done kind of my talks with teachers and administrators and families, I do think for the first time our Connections program is fully staffed, which is huge.

710
01:01:57,886 --> 01:02:02,549
So full staff for paraprofessionals and for teachers.

711
01:02:03,449 --> 01:02:05,211
However, my enrollment has gone up.

712
01:02:06,331 --> 01:02:10,155
So I am at, again, I want to say I'm at like 575 today.

713
01:02:10,216 --> 01:02:11,537
So my enrollment has gone up.

714
01:02:11,677 --> 01:02:25,933
So there are so many wonderful things going at the Roberts School, but I do think there are some pockets of some additional staff that I need so that I'm fully supporting students in an inclusive setting, specifically some inclusion type work.

715
01:02:28,123 --> 01:02:51,585
I think that we have to look at numbers and have conversations about the numbers of students that we service at the Roberts and just making sure that there's just equity amongst the schools, just to make sure that, like, again, I'm growing, my school's growing, and we're getting more diverse students on many different levels, have it be English language learners, special education,

716
01:02:53,820 --> 01:02:56,403
And I just, I want to make sure that we're addressing the needs of all of our kids.

717
01:02:56,443 --> 01:03:03,270
So I do think that there's some conversations that we can have regarding staffing and making sure that we're appropriately staffed kind of moving forward.

718
01:03:05,172 --> 01:03:13,822
Because with some more staff, obviously, I can do even more great things and just make sure that students are growing and that we're giving everything that they need and deserve.

719
01:03:14,525 --> 01:03:16,706
Right, and I think that comes from leadership, right?

720
01:03:16,766 --> 01:03:18,207
And I appreciate you saying that.

721
01:03:18,247 --> 01:03:23,689
And I think it's important that we continue the conversation because we need to hear the things both that are positive and the things that are needed.

722
01:03:24,069 --> 01:03:25,390
So thank you for sharing that.

723
01:03:25,470 --> 01:03:30,852
And then lastly, and I thank you to my colleagues and to the mayor for indulging me here.

724
01:03:30,912 --> 01:03:32,913
So this is a really, really last one, I promise.

725
01:03:33,913 --> 01:03:37,815
How can the school committee be involved in your school?

726
01:03:37,855 --> 01:03:41,817
In other words, are there opportunities for some of the events that you had, for example,

727
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:49,322
that school committee members can come to, or reading in any of the classrooms, and all of the classrooms, and all of the programming.

728
01:03:49,783 --> 01:03:53,225
I would love to invite any of you to come down to the Roberts.

729
01:03:53,285 --> 01:04:05,432
I think it's important when we're talking about our special programming, I can stand here and talk about the Connections program, and I can talk about our EL program, and our inclusion program, but for you to see it in action,

730
01:04:07,389 --> 01:04:12,350
I think that just puts a whole other lens on, huh, now I know what she's talking about, right?

731
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:26,753
So I welcome if you pop in, send me an email to come down and take a walk and see the things that we are doing and the needs that we have so that you can live it and see it.

732
01:04:26,773 --> 01:04:30,573
Because I do think that that's the way in which, I mean, I would love for any of you to come down.

733
01:04:30,633 --> 01:04:32,234
You can read to any of our kids.

734
01:04:32,574 --> 01:04:32,994
They love it.

735
01:04:33,744 --> 01:04:37,147
You can attend any of our assemblies, I can let you know when those are.

736
01:04:37,948 --> 01:04:46,236
But I think just coming down and living it and seeing it, I think will just give a perspective of setting priorities when we're talking about budget.

737
01:04:47,717 --> 01:04:48,178
You're welcome.

738
01:04:48,518 --> 01:04:49,099
Thank you so much.

739
01:04:49,139 --> 01:04:49,439
Thank you.

740
01:04:49,459 --> 01:04:51,781
You're welcome.

741
01:04:51,961 --> 01:04:52,302
Thank you.

742
01:04:57,767 --> 01:04:58,828
Hopefully my son's behaving.

743
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:12,029
Recommendation to approve a donation from the Consulate General of Italy for $4,851.77 for the Italian language program.

744
01:05:12,189 --> 01:05:12,930

Member Graham, all those in favor?

747
01:05:20,637 --> 01:05:23,219
Do we have to roll call this money?

748
01:05:25,301 --> 01:05:27,323
Roll call, Secretary Russo.

749
01:05:39,711 --> 01:05:42,654
Okay, we got a microphone issue.

750
01:05:42,894 --> 01:05:47,397
Oh, you can you can use a member of office, please.

751
01:05:47,858 --> 01:05:55,124
There you go.

752
01:05:56,785 --> 01:05:59,507
I'll take that button.

753
01:05:59,707 --> 01:06:00,528
It's the left button.

754
01:06:00,588 --> 01:06:01,669
It's always been the left button.

755
01:06:03,426 --> 01:06:04,687
One less email I have to send.

756
01:06:04,848 --> 01:06:05,548
Thank you.

757
01:06:07,390 --> 01:06:08,811
It's not my first rodeo here.

758
01:06:09,852 --> 01:06:11,053
Anyways, what am I doing?

759
01:06:11,453 --> 01:06:12,194

Yes.

763

Member McLaughlin?

764
01:06:17,579 --> 01:06:17,799
Yes.

765
01:06:17,959 --> 01:06:18,640
Member Olopade?

766
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:19,140
Yes.

767
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:20,161
Member Rheinfeldt?

768
01:06:21,662 --> 01:06:21,862
Yes.

769
01:06:22,563 --> 01:06:23,143
Member Rousseau?

770
01:06:23,183 --> 01:06:23,384
Yes.

771
01:06:23,424 --> 01:06:24,044
Mayor Longoker?

772
01:06:24,284 --> 01:06:24,485
Yes.

773
01:06:24,545 --> 01:06:25,906
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

774
01:06:26,426 --> 01:06:27,207
We accept the money.

775
01:06:27,918 --> 01:06:41,722

776
01:06:42,742 --> 01:06:43,542
Motion to approve.

777
01:06:43,762 --> 01:06:44,942
Thank you to the Cronin family.

Yes.

782

Member Graham.

783
01:06:57,129 --> 01:06:57,709
Oh, wait, what?

784
01:06:57,909 --> 01:06:58,730
Did I say the wrong thing?

785
01:06:59,410 --> 01:06:59,930
Did you say me?

786
01:07:00,870 --> 01:07:01,231
Yeah.

787
01:07:01,271 --> 01:07:02,631
It's a little hard to hear you.

788
01:07:02,891 --> 01:07:03,131
Is it?

789
01:07:03,571 --> 01:07:03,751
Yeah.

790
01:07:03,872 --> 01:07:05,592
I said Member Brandley and Member Graham.

791
01:07:05,992 --> 01:07:06,372
Oh, okay.

792
01:07:06,392 --> 01:07:06,532
Sorry.

793
01:07:06,572 --> 01:07:06,953
Yes, yes.

794
01:07:08,493 --> 01:07:10,194
Member McLaughlin is absent.

795
01:07:11,174 --> 01:07:11,954
Member Olopade?

796
01:07:12,114 --> 01:07:12,375
Yes.

797
01:07:12,915 --> 01:07:13,555
Member Rheinfeld?

798
01:07:13,835 --> 01:07:14,055
Yes.

799
01:07:14,395 --> 01:07:14,996
Member Rousseau?

800
01:07:15,156 --> 01:07:15,396
Yes.

801
01:07:15,496 --> 01:07:16,156
Mayor Longo?

802
01:07:16,636 --> 01:07:16,836
Yes.

803
01:07:16,936 --> 01:07:17,817
It's the affirmative.

804
01:07:17,937 --> 01:07:18,597
One absent.

805
01:07:19,317 --> 01:07:24,379
Motion to approve the donation acceptance has been approved.

806
01:07:25,114 --> 01:07:33,476
Number six, revised superintendent's evaluation goals, school year 2023-2024, Dr. Maurice Edward Vincent, our superintendent.

807
01:07:35,337 --> 01:07:35,917
Good evening.

808
01:07:36,677 --> 01:07:45,960
So this evening, in your packets you should have received on over the weekend, you have highlighted sections in orange.

809
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:51,602
So I did first present my goals back in October to the committee.

810
01:07:52,642 --> 01:07:59,986
And when I originally presented my goals, the committee gave feedback at that time.

811
01:08:00,607 --> 01:08:08,731
Everything that is listed in orange is either a revision or redaction or an addition.

812
01:08:09,772 --> 01:08:12,233
So under the district improvement goal,

813
01:08:15,569 --> 01:08:30,692
During the school year 23-24, the Medford Public Schools will improve the systems and structures that directly impact student services, student and family and communications, and school facilities and operations.

814
01:08:31,833 --> 01:08:55,085
And so the goals listed are in the left hand column, and under key actions, I'm only going to speak specifically to the changes that were made under key action number one, we eliminated the word physical and just said improve accessibility at school facilities and develop a maintenance ticket system.

815
01:08:56,465 --> 01:09:06,988
Under number four, reestablish the capital planning committee to examine building systems and create a replacement timeline for individual systems.

816
01:09:10,849 --> 01:09:22,633
Bullet number six, enhance human resource practices, such as job posting, hiring and payroll management, and to also be inclusive of labor relations.

817
01:09:24,623 --> 01:09:34,901
Bullet number seven, preparing and presenting to the committee a timely budget process for FY25.

818
01:09:37,096 --> 01:09:45,703
Bullet number eight, or number eight excessive heat protocol for the Medford public schools to be presented to the committee.

819
01:09:46,684 --> 01:09:53,809
Number nine, a revised middle school and high school schedule revised middle and high school schedules.

820
01:09:55,050 --> 01:10:00,874
Number 10 evidence of full implementation of the new bullying policy.

821
01:10:01,694 --> 01:10:16,284
Number 11 outcome of the high school climate study including measures of improvement in number 12, the strategic plan developed with the engagement of a wider audience of stakeholders.

822
01:10:17,948 --> 01:10:35,069
Those were all of the additions that were recommended by the committee under key actions, and then outcomes to finalize the employee handbook, which is significantly underway under increased accessibility of parking.

823
01:10:36,030 --> 01:10:50,852
pedestrian routes, restroom facilities, building signage and navigational aids, ASL or language interpretation, and closed captioning for video content.

824
01:10:51,412 --> 01:11:00,837
So additional verbiage to be more explicit about what the outcomes could be for that bulleted outcome.

825
01:11:01,597 --> 01:11:20,107
Under the communications platform, the feedback was to communications platforms such as some more and final site mass notifications are used regularly by all schools and to eliminate the language and student servicing groups because I think it just didn't belong there.

826
01:11:21,681 --> 01:11:36,334
Under outcomes on the back of page two on the final bullet was to have increased two way communication with families with a minimum of five additional events for this school year.

827
01:11:37,575 --> 01:11:41,479
Moving over to student learning, learning goal under literacy.

828
01:11:43,618 --> 01:11:57,326
The goal was to remain intact, but the committee requested that when the data is presented at the end of the year, that the data be disaggregated to show at each school under accountability.

829
01:11:57,766 --> 01:12:09,513
And so that language was added at each school for NWEA MAP and at each school for DIBELS, showing the growth from September of 2023 through June of 2024.

830
01:12:15,058 --> 01:12:19,943
And my professional practice goal was approved by the committee.

831
01:12:20,724 --> 01:12:37,461
So I apologize for the delay in not being able to present these goals before December, but I wanted just to let the committee see this, everything that's highlighted in orange.

832
01:12:38,702 --> 01:12:42,886
was the specific feedback that the committee provided at that time.

833
01:12:43,546 --> 01:12:51,793
And we carefully replayed the video and the audio to make sure that we captured all of the additions.

834
01:12:52,413 --> 01:13:02,181
And so my request to the committee is it's recommendation to approve so that I can actually start executing this work.

835
01:13:02,821 --> 01:13:03,202
Thank you.

836
01:13:03,222 --> 01:13:04,943
Thank you, Dr. Edward-Vincent.

837
01:13:05,483 --> 01:13:06,204
Member Graham.

838
01:13:06,965 --> 01:13:07,305
Thank you.

839
01:13:09,136 --> 01:13:09,636
Thank you for this.

840
01:13:09,696 --> 01:13:15,721
I had one question and perhaps one amendment if my colleagues are so inclined.

841
01:13:17,082 --> 01:13:26,328
The first question I had on the first page under number four, reestablish the capital planning committee to examine building systems and create replacement timeline for individual systems.

842
01:13:27,289 --> 01:13:29,010
Who do you envision is on this committee?

843
01:13:34,554 --> 01:13:36,255
We would definitely need to have

844
01:13:39,406 --> 01:13:45,490
Yes, I it and from city building and grounds, working with.

845
01:13:45,991 --> 01:14:06,906
Maybe you could ask for Paul, Ricky or someone from the city team to support us and as many members as possible, who would like to be part of the capital planning, and the feedback last time was to make sure that it was about the individual systems.

846
01:14:08,567 --> 01:14:10,288
based on the video.

847
01:14:13,370 --> 01:14:21,195
But I'm I am open to having other other stakeholders be involved, just, you know, for certain meetings.

848
01:14:22,896 --> 01:14:31,242
If it gets too too large, then it's it's it's hard to manage and it's hard to accomplish as much as you would like to accomplish.

849
01:14:31,684 --> 01:14:32,365
Sure.

850
01:14:32,545 --> 01:14:42,173
My, my major request is that this committee participate in that process actively versus sort of get something when you all think you're done.

851
01:14:42,293 --> 01:14:55,605
So I think we just need to think about that, especially with the subcommittee structure, like just figure out like the right way to do that and make sure that the committee can be apprised of like the consideration and the work that's being done because all of those things.

852
01:14:56,496 --> 01:15:01,901
You know, add up to either surprises where we're having to say to the mayor, like, hey, we don't have money for this.

853
01:15:02,041 --> 01:15:06,164
And does the city have money or we have to find money in our budget.

854
01:15:06,204 --> 01:15:07,886
And so all of that sort of

855
01:15:08,810 --> 01:15:26,746
So I would like this committee to have some way to know, like, when the meetings are like what what the meetings are happening about what the content is and then some way for us some portion of us to participate, whether that's like the building and grounds committee or the strategic planning committee like there's places where.

856
01:15:27,247 --> 01:15:30,049
those updates could happen in subcommittee, which I think is totally fine.

857
01:15:30,069 --> 01:15:34,613
I just want to make sure that we're on the same page that we need to participate in that.

858
01:15:35,013 --> 01:15:49,045
I was actually going to suggest as you were asking about that, which subcommittee could it possibly be folded into or kind of repurpose one of the subcommittee

859
01:15:49,785 --> 01:15:58,889
or ask two members of a particular subcommittee to be sitting members or permanent members.

860
01:15:58,909 --> 01:16:10,654
I think we can like work all of that out once the subcommittees are established and defined and all of that I just wanted to make sure that was on your radar that we should be participating in that process.

861
01:16:11,735 --> 01:16:12,775
Yes, definitely.

862
01:16:13,636 --> 01:16:18,898
And then my possible amendment is on page two.

863
01:16:19,941 --> 01:16:33,725
number 12 around the strategic plan and I think what you added to that was developed with the with a engagement of a wider audience of stakeholders which when we do strategic plan that's absolutely how we should do it.

864
01:16:34,525 --> 01:16:42,107
I am questioning whether that is reasonable to accomplish this year and I say that really specifically with

865
01:16:43,928 --> 01:16:56,619
In mind, some of the strategic work that the administration is going to have to do in preparation for MSBA so I think I'm concerned that there's just no way that you that the administration can do both of those things well.

866
01:16:58,520 --> 01:17:00,282
Between now and the end of the year so.

867
01:17:01,104 --> 01:17:05,866
when I think about the strategic work that has to happen on the MSBA side, right?

868
01:17:05,906 --> 01:17:19,892
Like there's, it's sort of a wide ranging set of activities, including like counting classrooms, but also talking about like, what's the educational plan we're trying to provide, collecting up past enrollment and looking at future enrollment.

869
01:17:20,052 --> 01:17:30,656
And because we have a vocational school, there's a whole complexity around the vocational school and the programming that we offer and what we want, what the capacity is right now and what we want the capacity to be.

870
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:36,925
And then new programs we might want to sort of provide for in addition to a whole maintenance plan.

871
01:17:36,985 --> 01:17:39,207
So there's so much strategic work there.

872
01:17:39,267 --> 01:17:45,071
I know there's like a scheduling thing going on right now as well in terms of updating the high school schedule and the middle school schedules.

873
01:17:45,712 --> 01:17:50,095
All of that has to get done in order for us to meet the requirements of our eligibility phase.

874
01:17:50,696 --> 01:18:00,244
And if with all of that work that has to get done, I just don't see how you also can have a meaningful community engagement process around the strategic plan.

875
01:18:01,007 --> 01:18:10,651
So I would like to make a motion to approve this with the amendment that we strike number 12 completely, because I just don't think it's reasonable for you to accomplish that right now.

876
01:18:12,932 --> 01:18:13,732
I support that.

877
01:18:15,913 --> 01:18:16,973
That recommendation.

878
01:18:18,354 --> 01:18:26,057
So motion on the floor for approval as amended, proposing to strike number 12.

879
01:18:26,157 --> 01:18:27,938
Member McLaughlin.

880
01:18:27,998 --> 01:18:28,338
Thank you.

881
01:18:29,460 --> 01:18:38,343
I appreciate the concern with too many things to do, especially with the MSBA and the work that is trying to be done there.

882
01:18:38,403 --> 01:18:50,387
At the same time, if there's work being done on the strategic plan, I still would wanna be thinking about how a wider range of stakeholders are being engaged with that.

883
01:18:50,427 --> 01:18:55,089
So again, maybe it's the Family Engagement Subcommittee or something, but maybe it's not necessarily

884
01:18:56,334 --> 01:19:05,940
Superintendent has to specifically plan something, but maybe it's a subcommittee could do something and not as vast as maybe is what the expectation is here.

885
01:19:05,980 --> 01:19:09,942
I'm assuming that it's actually not clarified on the right how that would actually be done.

886
01:19:10,602 --> 01:19:17,926
So I'm curious about what that would actually look like developed with the engagement of a wider audience of stakeholders.

887
01:19:17,987 --> 01:19:21,188
Like how do you actually break that down into action items?

888
01:19:22,751 --> 01:19:36,479
And so I hear you in one sense that yes, there's a lot of work to be done, but in another sense, I don't wanna sacrifice family engagement and community engagement at all.

889
01:19:36,559 --> 01:19:41,602
So I'm wondering if there's some kind of a happy medium or something in between.

890
01:19:42,703 --> 01:19:54,775
If I may, through the chair, at the time when I presented in October, we hadn't yet received the wonderful news of December that we were actually approved this time for the MSBA.

891
01:19:55,235 --> 01:20:01,961
When I originally presented my goals, I had six key actions.

892
01:20:02,842 --> 01:20:05,963
and the six key actions jumped doubled from six to 12.

893
01:20:06,924 --> 01:20:15,287
And member Russo kind of shared at that time with the committee that there were so many hours in a day.

894
01:20:15,867 --> 01:20:26,591
But I'm not afraid to list if there were 25 things that are listed by the time June rolls around, it's either I can make all 25 or you do or you don't.

895
01:20:26,651 --> 01:20:28,752
So we're gonna try to do it.

896
01:20:29,572 --> 01:20:31,773
In terms of the strategic plan, I have been working

897
01:20:33,014 --> 01:20:38,318
with administrators, we have started new programs, curriculum programs.

898
01:20:38,338 --> 01:20:55,011
So there is work that is happening, but the fact that we have now been approved to participate in MSBA, there is a lot of work that we're gonna have to do for that.

899
01:20:55,491 --> 01:20:55,811
So it's,

900
01:20:57,092 --> 01:21:11,664
strategic plan it's not that it's going away that is still our kind of guidebook our blue book that we're referring to, but at the same time, it would make sense to defer it.

901
01:21:12,724 --> 01:21:20,671
Like, you know, I can focus on the 11 and then for the beginning of next year which we, you know, will be in that MSBA.

902
01:21:21,671 --> 01:21:22,871
phase one process.

903
01:21:23,331 --> 01:21:27,532
So all of this work will end up being done like almost again.

904
01:21:27,652 --> 01:21:37,714
So we could do something and then what ends up happening as a result of the MSBA is like, throw all of that out and let's start over with something new.

905
01:21:39,054 --> 01:21:42,915
So I... Member McLaughlin, then Member Graham.

906
01:21:43,595 --> 01:21:44,275
Yeah, thank you.

907
01:21:44,355 --> 01:21:46,676
I just, in response to that, I appreciate that.

908
01:21:46,796 --> 01:21:48,916
And I guess what I'm feeling is that

909
01:21:49,662 --> 01:22:15,389
it's about integrating some of this work with, not just specifically the strategic plan, which I know that this is the line item in particular we're talking about in terms of engaging stakeholders, but I even am wondering like, and I know there was a great flow chart in here about the MSBA process, and I think that's really great, and I know that there was outreach and communication in the letter, and I'm thinking about how we're actively engaging people and even what is the MSBA process, right?

910
01:22:15,429 --> 01:22:16,369
So I think it's, again,

911
01:22:17,193 --> 01:22:24,263
family and community engagement and thinking about how it's integrated in all of these things, not necessarily about in this one strategic plan and reaching out to stakeholders.

912
01:22:24,303 --> 01:22:30,732
And so crossing that off the list, I think can give the interpretation or the impression that we're not engaging stakeholders.

913
01:22:30,932 --> 01:22:32,655
And I don't want that obviously to be the case.

914
01:22:33,166 --> 01:22:51,434
But under outcomes, we did add five additional family community engagement events that will be, those could be about budget, like creating additional opportunities for the community to have that two-way communication.

915
01:22:51,934 --> 01:23:00,318
So I do think that there will be additional opportunities for greater community engagement.

916
01:23:00,697 --> 01:23:12,788
And I think we have the plan of a new high school which will bring about much community engagement from the committee to the open the public meetings will be having for input throughout the course of the next two years.

917
01:23:12,808 --> 01:23:14,010
Remember, Graham.

918
01:23:14,910 --> 01:23:22,838
Yeah, I just wanted to offer maybe another suggestion to one thing that family and community engagement subcommittee could do this year is

919
01:23:24,730 --> 01:23:32,676
sort of articulate and map out what a strategic planning process that includes meaningful community engagement looks like for next year.

920
01:23:33,177 --> 01:23:52,431
Because I think in my mind, I would just like everyone to just keep working at the strategic plan that exists right now, hit pause on the idea of creating something new for just a couple months so that we can get this MSBA process off to a good solid start.

921
01:23:52,952 --> 01:23:53,892
And in that time,

922
01:23:55,094 --> 01:24:10,827
subcommittee could meet and say what would it look like for the community and families to be meaningfully engaged in a strategic planning process and outline that so that at the beginning of next year when we say okay we're ready for the strategic plan we can say and this is what

923
01:24:11,348 --> 01:24:15,289
we sort of think and recommend that this looks like from an engagement perspective.

924
01:24:15,329 --> 01:24:27,833
So I think something like that probably could be accomplished in like a meeting or two, and also provide sort of good preparation for when the administration's gonna turn their attention to that next year.

925
01:24:28,673 --> 01:24:38,235
So that is sort of what I'm thinking, because I agree, I don't think we wanna say, we're not trying to say that we don't want community engagement, that's not it at all.

926
01:24:38,656 --> 01:24:40,236
I think what we are saying though is,

927
01:24:40,572 --> 01:24:46,913
There are only 24 hours in the day and strategic planning is really hard, earnest work, and there's just not time to do it well.

928
01:24:47,033 --> 01:24:55,875
And I would rather us just push it off a little bit if it means we have an opportunity to do it well then, rather than do it now.

929
01:24:57,835 --> 01:24:58,736
I think that's reasonable.

930
01:24:59,116 --> 01:25:06,157
And as long as we're talking about the subcommittee and family engagement and making sure that we're being strategic about that, then that would be okay.

931
01:25:09,766 --> 01:25:11,987
Second.

932
01:25:12,707 --> 01:25:18,249
Motion for approval as amended by Member Graham, seconded by Member Rousseau.

933
01:25:19,790 --> 01:25:20,610
All those in favor?

934
01:25:20,910 --> 01:25:21,570
Aye.

935
01:25:21,831 --> 01:25:24,332
All those opposed?

936
01:25:24,732 --> 01:25:26,912
Motion for approval passes as amended.

937
01:25:28,293 --> 01:25:28,613
Thank you.

938
01:25:29,733 --> 01:25:34,855
And last under updates is a recommendation to approve the school year 24-25 school calendar

939
01:25:37,093 --> 01:25:41,879
presented by Dr. Peter Cushing, Assistant Superintendent of Enrichment, Innovation, and Operations.

940
01:25:42,740 --> 01:25:42,960
Welcome.

941
01:25:48,422 --> 01:25:50,883
Good evening, Madam Mayor, members of the school committee, thank you very much.

942
01:25:51,223 --> 01:25:54,285
This year, we're presenting three options for the committee to consider.

943
01:25:55,165 --> 01:26:05,610
The first is really focusing on the committee's wishes to honor the religious holidays through the Jewish, Islamic, and Christian faiths.

944
01:26:05,630 --> 01:26:12,533
The last day of school, I'm sorry, the first day of school for all calendars is Tuesday, August 27th, 2024.

945
01:26:12,593 --> 01:26:16,075
For the last several years, we have begun on a Wednesday.

946
01:26:17,336 --> 01:26:22,641
The last day of school on this with no snow days would be Tuesday, June 17th.

947
01:26:23,622 --> 01:26:33,052
The second option we're presenting is no religious holidays observed in the Christian, Islamic or Jewish faith structures.

948
01:26:34,193 --> 01:26:37,957
We recognize and affirm all of our students and families

949
01:26:38,437 --> 01:26:57,471
religious beliefs, but provide them the opportunity to take religious observance days as necessary and to really work to ensure that there is no work assigned as is actually under state law, not just school committee policy, but also state law.

950
01:26:57,611 --> 01:27:02,334
So the last day of school for this would be Thursday, June 12th.

951
01:27:03,515 --> 01:27:07,238
And then we also considered an earliest possible release.

952
01:27:08,171 --> 01:27:16,834
which would get us out on Wednesday, June 11th, but that would mean that the half day before Christmas vacation would be Monday, December 23rd.

953
01:27:16,854 --> 01:27:28,718
I also wanna say that I realized that that half day would probably have exceptionally low attendance in all categories of constituents of the Medford Public Schools, and I will leave it at that.

954
01:27:29,999 --> 01:27:30,199
Mayor.

955
01:27:31,499 --> 01:27:32,640
Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

956
01:27:33,540 --> 01:27:34,180
Member Russo.

957
01:27:34,780 --> 01:27:35,521
Thank you very much.

958
01:27:37,054 --> 01:27:59,792
we, it's not our wishes, it's our policy, which we approved two years, December of 2020 is when we approved this policy and it went through our standard processes and was deliberated and there was plenty of input from the community as well as the committee at the time and the administration had plenty of opportunity to speak at our meetings.

959
01:28:01,533 --> 01:28:06,657
I won't pretend that it's not an uncomfortable conversation to have to suggest that we're gonna

960
01:28:07,011 --> 01:28:09,113
honor some religious holidays and not others.

961
01:28:10,214 --> 01:28:16,039
So while it was an open meeting, I do acknowledge that it's a difficult conversation.

962
01:28:17,080 --> 01:28:23,105
I will say that I disliked the use of your preferred calendar.

963
01:28:23,626 --> 01:28:24,907
The committee has a policy.

964
01:28:25,007 --> 01:28:27,970
So frankly, the administration's preference is not a real thing.

965
01:28:28,550 --> 01:28:29,991
It's the committee's policy.

966
01:28:30,091 --> 01:28:33,474
So I was a little taken aback by,

967
01:28:34,332 --> 01:28:38,613
the administration having a preference to not abide by the policy of this body.

968
01:28:39,893 --> 01:28:47,995
But that aside, I'd motion to approve calendar A, which abides by our policy.

969
01:28:48,635 --> 01:28:51,376
That's the calendar I would motion to approve.

970
01:28:51,716 --> 01:28:59,458
And the second motion I have is to send calendar options B and C to a committee of the whole, so this whole

971
01:29:01,079 --> 01:29:12,710
This whole committee can sit down and, and discuss what are our goals around calendars and observations and there's clearly some people want to get out of school as soon as possible.

972
01:29:13,290 --> 01:29:19,757
And I think that if that is the goal we should be talking about more than just the religious holidays, frankly.

973
01:29:21,018 --> 01:29:24,221
There's February vacation is an utterly ridiculous thing.

974
01:29:26,721 --> 01:29:28,403
And my understanding is teachers hate it.

975
01:29:28,483 --> 01:29:34,649
They finally figured out how to start teaching kids after Christmas break, winter break as we pretend to call it.

976
01:29:36,091 --> 01:29:37,992
And then suddenly we're all gone again.

977
01:29:38,433 --> 01:29:44,239
So I think it's worth another conversation to revisit this calendar policy.

978
01:29:44,319 --> 01:29:46,301
So those are my two motions.

979
01:29:49,102 --> 01:29:51,222
Just from the chair, if I could ask that they be separate.

980
01:29:51,283 --> 01:29:56,744
I think I agree with which calendar you want to choose and why, and I think that's been fully vetted.

981
01:29:56,764 --> 01:30:00,824
I second calendar A. Motion.

982
01:30:01,465 --> 01:30:03,685
You'll second calendar A motion.

983
01:30:03,925 --> 01:30:08,546
So motion by Member Rousseau to approve calendar A, seconded by Member McLaughlin.

984
01:30:09,106 --> 01:30:09,926
All those in favor?

985
01:30:09,946 --> 01:30:10,907
Aye.

986
01:30:11,607 --> 01:30:12,407
All those opposed?

987
01:30:13,729 --> 01:30:15,170
calendar A has been accepted.

988
01:30:15,190 --> 01:30:22,336
Now members, so you wanna give a motion to potentially send this to committee to discuss?

989
01:30:22,396 --> 01:30:25,259
Calendar B and C, the calendar policy.

990
01:30:25,279 --> 01:30:28,041
Okay, so if I could ask for a roll call on that.

991
01:30:28,301 --> 01:30:30,363
Sure.

992
01:30:31,043 --> 01:30:33,125
Point of inquiry.

993
01:30:33,145 --> 01:30:36,348
I'm getting, sorry.

994
01:30:40,781 --> 01:30:42,882
the whole or to the policy subcommittee?

995
01:30:43,042 --> 01:30:44,283
I thought you said Committee the whole, right?

996
01:30:44,343 --> 01:30:44,623
Okay.

997
01:30:44,643 --> 01:30:45,184
Committee of the whole.

998
01:30:45,344 --> 01:30:45,524
Yeah.

999
01:30:45,664 --> 01:30:45,984
Thank you.

1000
01:30:46,104 --> 01:30:46,425
Second.

1001
01:30:48,766 --> 01:30:49,567
Roll call, please.

1002
01:30:50,267 --> 01:30:50,867
Member Bramley.

1003
01:30:51,348 --> 01:30:51,548
Yes.

1004
01:30:51,768 --> 01:30:52,108
Oh, sorry.

1005
01:30:52,869 --> 01:30:53,429
Memogram.

1006
01:30:55,210 --> 01:30:55,490
Yes.

1007
01:30:55,851 --> 01:30:58,152
Remember McLaughlin?

1008
01:30:58,532 --> 01:30:58,812
Yes.

1009
01:30:58,933 --> 01:30:59,753
Remember all the potting?

1010
01:30:59,893 --> 01:31:00,173
Yes.

1011
01:31:00,454 --> 01:31:00,714
Remember?

1012
01:31:00,754 --> 01:31:01,174
Reinfeld?

1013
01:31:01,754 --> 01:31:01,994
Yes.

1014
01:31:02,455 --> 01:31:02,775
Remember?

1015
01:31:02,815 --> 01:31:03,596
So yes, Marilyn.

1016
01:31:03,676 --> 01:31:03,916
Okay.

1017
01:31:04,116 --> 01:31:04,296
No.

1018
01:31:04,796 --> 01:31:08,779
So six in the affirmative one of the negative motion to send

1019
01:31:09,346 --> 01:31:11,447
B and C to committee has been approved.

1020
01:31:12,827 --> 01:31:13,648
Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

1021
01:31:15,249 --> 01:31:17,369
We have no presentations of the public.

1022
01:31:19,871 --> 01:31:37,358
We have no continued business and we do have one item under new business 2024-01 offered by member Graham, whereas the Metropolitan Public Schools recognizes the vital role of play in the development and wellbeing of students, whereas the current playground facilities at McGlynn Elementary are in need of replacement

1023
01:31:37,867 --> 01:31:41,750
to create a safe and fun environment that meets the growing and diverse needs of our student body.

1024
01:31:42,331 --> 01:32:02,608
And whereas the creation of new inclusive and engaging playground is a priority of the enhancement of our educational environment, now therefore be it resolved that the Medford School Committee, number one, establishes the McGlynn Playground Replacement Initiative and a donation campaign pursuant to policy FF, policy for dedication and naming of school buildings, facilities, and grounds.

1025
01:32:03,168 --> 01:32:06,251
Number two, requests the administration establish a mechanism

1026
01:32:06,872 --> 01:32:17,697
to account for and report on the donations, and three, request the administration set up a public relations campaign to solicit donations to the playground fund to offset the cost of replacing the playground.

1027
01:32:18,358 --> 01:32:24,421
The promotion of the initiative will occur through school newsletters, local media, social media, and community events.

1028
01:32:24,761 --> 01:32:28,263
The campaign will have the following objectives and donation tier structure.

1029
01:32:28,923 --> 01:32:32,525
Objective, to raise funds for the construction of a new playground at McGlynn Elementary.

1030
01:32:33,396 --> 01:32:36,738
that fosters a safe, inclusive, and stimulating environment for all students.

1031
01:32:37,459 --> 01:32:38,780
Donation tier structure.

1032
01:32:39,240 --> 01:32:44,144
Hopscotch Hero tier, donations 50 to 250, sorry, 249.

1033
01:32:45,184 --> 01:32:48,407
Swing Set Superstar tier, donations 250 to 499.

1034
01:32:48,447 --> 01:32:49,648
Slide Savant tier, donations of $500 to $999.

1035
01:32:50,728 --> 01:32:53,630
Climbing Frame Champion tier, donations of 1,000 to $4,999.

1036
01:33:02,082 --> 01:33:23,151
and the merry ground mastermind here donations of 5000 and above donor benefits will be the recognition in a district wide press release personalized thank you note signed by the school committee superintendent and school principal name on a plaque is a good one name on a plaque at the playground entrance and invitation to the playground ribbon cutting offered by member Graham.

1037
01:33:24,585 --> 01:33:24,905
Thank you.

1038
01:33:26,047 --> 01:33:34,759
I was not necessarily planning for this to happen on the same day as the playground groundbreaking but it was exciting it's sort of exciting that it is.

1039
01:33:36,081 --> 01:33:39,305
So, when we, when we talked about.

1040
01:33:40,668 --> 01:33:46,450
the adopting our policy around dedication and naming of buildings, facilities, and grounds, which is FF.

1041
01:33:46,510 --> 01:33:50,532
And I did ask the superintendent to put this in your package just so you had it.

1042
01:33:51,652 --> 01:34:03,656
Last year, sort of right at the same time, we were talking about the McGlynn playground and I offered to draft a resolution, which I have finally done.

1043
01:34:03,776 --> 01:34:08,958
So my apologies for the delay to open up a donation

1044
01:34:10,006 --> 01:34:14,147
mechanism for the community to participate in funding the playground.

1045
01:34:14,207 --> 01:34:38,995
So while the vast majority of all the big components of the playground are funded, there is an opportunity for additional funding to offset the overall cost of the playground, but also to help us do things like put mature plantings in instead of much younger plantings that are going to take longer to create the shade that we're looking for or the

1046
01:34:40,532 --> 01:34:42,093
structures that we wanna see.

1047
01:34:43,074 --> 01:34:52,001
So there's plenty of opportunity and we know that money is not endless for these kinds of projects.

1048
01:34:52,021 --> 01:35:07,053
So I put this forward totally not wed or tied to really any of it, except that the playground committee has talked about wanting to make sure that how people donate to the playground

1049
01:35:07,591 --> 01:35:24,989
can be recognized in one central place and that we not be offering up naming rights to individual like pieces of equipment because it was the team's belief that we shouldn't, you shouldn't be able to buy your spot on a, an inclusive playground.

1050
01:35:26,563 --> 01:35:30,867
I felt like a plaque on the outside that says, here's all the people who donated is a great way to do it.

1051
01:35:31,087 --> 01:35:33,369
And maybe it's going to be a big plaque.

1052
01:35:33,409 --> 01:35:34,230
I think that's okay.

1053
01:35:34,250 --> 01:35:35,651
Maybe it's a sign instead of a plaque.

1054
01:35:35,671 --> 01:35:36,952
I think that's totally fine.

1055
01:35:38,113 --> 01:35:48,723
But I think providing some sort of mechanism so that we can create a way for people to participate is important, but sort of stopping short of like

1056
01:35:49,190 --> 01:35:55,033
naming things and bushes and pavers and cobblestones and I'm trying to stay away from that.

1057
01:35:55,133 --> 01:35:57,614
I was trying to stay away from that in terms of the structure that I set up.

1058
01:35:57,674 --> 01:36:08,060
So totally open to suggestions or changes and hopefully we can do this.

1059
01:36:08,280 --> 01:36:08,980
Yeah, thank you.

1060
01:36:10,701 --> 01:36:16,624
We were both part of the playground committee, so I appreciate the background and sharing the information about

1061
01:36:17,627 --> 01:36:21,928
the intention of the donations and the community engagement involved.

1062
01:36:23,068 --> 01:36:28,890
And I just want to make sure, again, that particularly it being an inclusive playground, that we are being inclusive.

1063
01:36:29,870 --> 01:36:31,550
And so a few things.

1064
01:36:31,590 --> 01:36:33,451
I think the plaque is obviously fine.

1065
01:36:34,211 --> 01:36:36,551
Not naming individual things I think is clearly important.

1066
01:36:37,051 --> 01:36:44,533
I also want to share with the committee and the community some of the gestation really of some of the inclusive playground work as well.

1067
01:36:45,294 --> 01:37:03,866
I think I may have shared this, I know I shared this story with the playground committee, I'm not sure I shared it with school committee, but years ago, there was a student here who had significant medical needs and disability and was in a wheelchair and did not communicate with words and was in an out of district residential placement.

1068
01:37:04,506 --> 01:37:12,131
In out of district residential placements, the students do come home during school vacations and on some occasions.

1069
01:37:12,872 --> 01:37:14,453
And when that would occur, the student,

1070
01:37:14,914 --> 01:37:25,013
had no opportunity in the community really to be engaged and involved, and was not able to really be part of the community and in the schools and mom in particular shared that story with us, the family was.

1071
01:37:26,704 --> 01:37:28,805
from Brazil initially and had emigrated here.

1072
01:37:29,025 --> 01:37:36,047
And mom was a single mom and had done a tremendous job and had shared that at a leadership, disability leadership program that we were in and they were Medford.

1073
01:37:37,127 --> 01:37:39,428
The little girl passed away when she was 15.

1074
01:37:40,068 --> 01:37:42,149
Her name is Emily Oliveira.

1075
01:37:42,909 --> 01:37:50,291
She's actually in the Oakland Park Cemetery right next to Crystal and her picture's there.

1076
01:37:50,832 --> 01:37:55,133
And I think she deserves to be remembered in particular around this inclusive playground

1077
01:37:55,749 --> 01:37:57,790
and in particular around the swings.

1078
01:37:58,931 --> 01:38:03,494
Mom really wanted a swing that was accessible for her wheelchair.

1079
01:38:04,154 --> 01:38:12,039
And I would like some commemoration to Emily and her mom for what I feel like the community should have done for them a long time ago.

1080
01:38:12,099 --> 01:38:16,342
And I know that mom would be really thrilled to see something like that for Emily.

1081
01:38:17,243 --> 01:38:19,584
Maybe some sort of picture of Emily.

1082
01:38:20,685 --> 01:38:21,425
Thank you for sharing.

1083
01:38:21,726 --> 01:38:22,186
Member Russo.

1084
01:38:22,625 --> 01:38:29,170
I just wanted to second it, but since member McLaughlin has just spoken, I think I completely agree.

1085
01:38:29,190 --> 01:38:34,954
I hope that this doesn't come across as any kind of like no names anywhere kind of thing.

1086
01:38:35,354 --> 01:38:37,976
It's just like, you can't buy your name and it's the point.

1087
01:38:38,617 --> 01:38:40,658
But I think that's an absolutely great idea.

1088
01:38:40,718 --> 01:38:50,886
And I don't know if we or the naming committee or somebody else should be involved in doing that because it's just an exceptionally good example of how

1089
01:38:52,230 --> 01:39:02,056
you know, there is a place and a time for naming or names to be in a space, and that seems like an exceptionally good example, so thank you.

1090
01:39:02,136 --> 01:39:03,297
So anyways, I seconded that.

1091
01:39:04,118 --> 01:39:07,540
And just from the chair, I don't know if we wanna leave it a little bit open-ended.

1092
01:39:07,600 --> 01:39:20,728
If we have hundreds and hundreds of people donating five, 10, 50 to $100, just leave it open-ended for either a subcommittee or the superintendent to decide whose name would go on a plaque.

1093
01:39:20,768 --> 01:39:21,589
A lot of times,

1094
01:39:23,030 --> 01:39:24,491
Or do we just put it on the website?

1095
01:39:24,511 --> 01:39:29,535
I just think if you have hundreds and hundreds of names, I don't know how you're gonna, it will take up a whole fence.

1096
01:39:29,915 --> 01:39:30,295
A wall.

1097
01:39:30,315 --> 01:39:31,376
A whole wall.

1098
01:39:31,396 --> 01:39:32,717
If that's what we wanna do, that's fine.

1099
01:39:32,777 --> 01:39:35,459
I just... May I ask a follow-up question?

1100
01:39:36,120 --> 01:39:38,441
Just particular to the donations as well.

1101
01:39:38,622 --> 01:39:44,166
And I don't know if the process needs to be thought out at this point or if it already has been memorandum and you wanna share.

1102
01:39:45,226 --> 01:39:51,251
I'm wondering, so where are the funds going and who's allocating this expenditures for

1103
01:39:52,172 --> 01:39:54,213
improvements on the playground and that sort of thing.

1104
01:39:54,693 --> 01:39:54,953
Sure.

1105
01:39:55,073 --> 01:40:21,204
So, my expectation would be given that we don't know what we will generate in terms of revenue that once we have an idea of what that looks like, the playground committee will work with the builder or the contractor and the architect to figure out like are there features that needs that can be added like where do those mature plants go, etcetera that sort of makes sense or is it that

1106
01:40:22,564 --> 01:40:27,949
we need to draw less from CPC or like what's the recommendation?

1107
01:40:27,989 --> 01:40:35,135
So I would expect the playground subcommittee chairs to help lead that in concert with the city.

1108
01:40:37,537 --> 01:40:37,898
Thank you.

1109
01:40:38,018 --> 01:40:45,265
May I may I just so is there a timeline or is that will the motion have a timeline on donations or do you want to just deal with that later?

1110
01:40:46,005 --> 01:40:46,866
So it sounds like

1111
01:40:47,216 --> 01:40:55,580
I hear what you're saying, and I think that's a great idea, especially with the committee having worked for over a year on this and knowing a lot of the conversations that have occurred.

1112
01:40:55,660 --> 01:40:56,800
So I think that sounds great.

1113
01:40:57,580 --> 01:41:03,843
That said, is there a window for the donations that the community can know about, or is that something that's still being thought about?

1114
01:41:05,684 --> 01:41:10,046
I was sort of taking the approach that we'll always take your money.

1115
01:41:13,535 --> 01:41:39,166
But I think to your point, like perhaps there is a timeframe where we say like, we'll, we'll like plan by this date and the playground committee might need to give us what that reasonable date is to say by that all the money received by this date, and maybe that's the like sort of one of the qualifiers like that we can add to this so we can maybe just add a placeholder for like a date certain that we will

1116
01:41:39,708 --> 01:41:42,050
know finalize the plaque and do all of that stuff.

1117
01:41:42,450 --> 01:42:03,247
So motion for amendment with the motion to have a date to be determined regarding the donations just to that end because if it is the developer of the playground committee that is talking about how that money is being spent and certainly money will be accepted after I'm sure but the monies that could be spent for the playground improvements and I guess really even thoughts of some

1118
01:42:03,880 --> 01:42:20,037
mechanism for how it's going to work after if people donate money after where does that money go like I just don't want it to end up in some, you know, major fund at the school level necessarily not that they don't, it's not needed, but if people are donating specifically for the playground that it really should go to the playground.

1119
01:42:20,057 --> 01:42:24,502
Maybe I'm going to let Dr. Edwardson but maybe a maintenance account for the playground.

1120
01:42:26,229 --> 01:42:27,950
Yes, I was going to say on the school side.

1121
01:42:28,931 --> 01:42:31,673
Once we had access to the resolution.

1122
01:42:31,693 --> 01:42:42,922
I was working with the business office and they are working on creating a playground, a playground account where people would be able to go online.

1123
01:42:43,842 --> 01:43:12,697
Since there will be a press release and all of the other steps that were kind of detailed in the resolution we are working on having something where if people want to give to the playground there will be a specific account created for that so the money would go into that particular account and it is tax deductible so it would be properly documented and so we're working on that but again we just started the ball rolling on that but we would be able to

1124
01:43:14,083 --> 01:43:23,706
have it on the school side so it could be properly documented, and then kept in that one area, specifically earmarked for the McGlynn playground.

1125
01:43:24,126 --> 01:43:30,508
So, you know, anyone, any entrepreneurs out there, Miss bloom sack and others.

1126
01:43:31,508 --> 01:43:43,011
Other wonderful friends and members of the community who want to be part of donating towards the equipment, it'll be there and kept in that sacred account.

1127
01:43:43,729 --> 01:43:44,089
Thank you.

1128
01:43:44,990 --> 01:43:45,550
Member Russo.

1129
01:43:45,870 --> 01:43:46,230
Thank you.

1130
01:43:46,270 --> 01:43:49,812
So for the language, let me know if this sounds okay.

1131
01:43:50,412 --> 01:44:00,237
The playground committee will determine a date for which donors having given will appear on the plaque.

1132
01:44:00,878 --> 01:44:04,579
I'll rephrase that to make a little more sense when I'm not just writing it in.

1133
01:44:04,900 --> 01:44:07,081
Date to be determined based on the plaque.

1134
01:44:07,761 --> 01:44:08,361
Yeah, whoever's.

1135
01:44:08,521 --> 01:44:08,782
Right.

1136
01:44:11,743 --> 01:44:13,024
So on the amendment.

1137
01:44:15,040 --> 01:44:15,700
I'll second that.

1138
01:44:18,161 --> 01:44:24,784
And also just, Dr. Watt-Vincent pointed out, maybe it should just say plaque or sign.

1139
01:44:26,345 --> 01:44:26,525
Yeah.

1140
01:44:26,745 --> 01:44:29,386
If we have 5,000 people who might want to sign.

1141
01:44:32,768 --> 01:44:39,511
So motion for approval by Member Graham, I believe, amended by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member McLaughlin.

1142
01:44:39,531 --> 01:44:40,531
Oh, we're just going to do it all at once?

1143
01:44:40,551 --> 01:44:41,032
That's fine.

1144
01:44:42,873 --> 01:44:43,813
Seconded by Member Russo.

1145
01:44:46,225 --> 01:44:47,126
All those in favor?

1146
01:44:48,367 --> 01:44:48,907
Aye.

1147
01:44:49,367 --> 01:44:50,108
All those opposed?

1148
01:44:51,709 --> 01:44:52,509
Motion is approved.

1149
01:44:53,230 --> 01:45:12,783
I'd like to make a motion, if I could, that we have some, I'm making a motion that we have some way that the inclusive playground at the McGlynn School memorialize the memory of Emily Oliveira, student from Medford Public Schools.

1150
01:45:13,959 --> 01:45:16,901
Motion by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Graham.

1151
01:45:17,221 --> 01:45:17,881

1152
01:45:18,321 --> 01:45:18,781
Aye.

1153
01:45:18,902 --> 01:45:19,542
All those opposed?

1154
01:45:20,282 --> 01:45:20,923
Motion passes.

1155
01:45:21,303 --> 01:45:22,143
Thank you, Member McLaughlin.

1156
01:45:22,863 --> 01:45:29,347
We do not have any reports requested, and we do have a number of condolences, if you'll bear with me.

1157
01:45:29,887 --> 01:45:38,371
The members of the Medford School Committee expressed their sincerest condolences to the family of Judith Granara, retired elementary school teacher for the Medford Public Schools.

1158
01:45:38,892 --> 01:45:43,714
Mrs. Granara was the wife of former school committee member and state representative, Attorney John Granara.

1159
01:45:44,209 --> 01:45:46,571
and was a cousin of former Mayor Michael J. McGlynn.

1160
01:45:48,132 --> 01:46:05,323
The members of the Medford School Committee expressed their sincerest condolences to the family of Ernest Ernie A. Artelino Sr., former head coach of the Medford High School girls basketball team, former assistant coach of the high school football team, and longtime Babe Ruth baseball coach.

1161
01:46:06,324 --> 01:46:11,387

1162
01:46:11,912 --> 01:46:16,113

1165
01:46:37,176 --> 01:46:41,998
a former kindergarten aid at the Brooks School and currently works at the Brooks morning program.

1166
01:46:42,459 --> 01:46:44,420
We all may rise for a moment of silence.

1167
01:46:45,920 --> 01:46:49,502
And Ernie Artelino was my basketball coach and he was very memorable.

1168
01:46:49,802 --> 01:46:53,104
I remember he benched me for dying my hair pink.

1169
01:46:54,484 --> 01:47:00,087
And he didn't let me play again until a bunch of parents started wearing pink wigs to say, okay, let her play, let her play.

1170
01:47:00,647 --> 01:47:02,408
So if we could take a moment of silence.

1171
01:47:14,517 --> 01:47:18,238
We have our next meeting on January 29th, 2024, 6 p.m.
