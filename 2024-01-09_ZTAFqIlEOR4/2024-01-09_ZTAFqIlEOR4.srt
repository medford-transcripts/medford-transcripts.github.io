[SPEAKER_13]: 70 affirmative, zero in the negative.

72
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:04,894
[SPEAKER_13]: Congratulations to our secretary, Member Ruseau.

73
00:07:09,275 --> 00:07:13,499
[SPEAKER_13]: We have number five, consent agenda, bills and payrolls, and regular school committee.

74
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,722
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, good of the order, yes, number four.

75
00:07:16,742 --> 00:07:19,244
[SPEAKER_13]: Does anybody have anything for good of the order?

76
00:07:19,264 --> 00:07:20,885
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Graham.

77
00:07:21,286 --> 00:07:21,786
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

78
00:07:21,806 --> 00:07:32,216
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually, you all received from me earlier today just a Google form that outlines what our committees are.

79
00:07:34,008 --> 00:07:39,251
[SPEAKER_11]: Basically, the mayor and I worked on it together, and she was having some access issues to get it out the door, so I sent it.

80
00:07:39,371 --> 00:07:42,453
[SPEAKER_11]: But it outlines a couple of things.

81
00:07:42,513 --> 00:07:46,375
[SPEAKER_11]: First, it outlines our committees from last time, from the last session.

82
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:49,377
[SPEAKER_11]: We are under no obligation to keep them.

83
00:07:49,877 --> 00:07:57,521
[SPEAKER_11]: So as you look at them, if you're like, I don't know what that committee does or why it would do anything, it's OK to say, I don't think we need that committee.

84
00:07:57,581 --> 00:08:01,883
[SPEAKER_11]: So for example, in our last session, we had a personnel and budget subcommittee.

85
00:08:02,284 --> 00:08:02,804
[SPEAKER_11]: They never met.

86
00:08:03,342 --> 00:08:14,271
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that's actually one that I will say I don't think that we need because we tend to operate a little bit differently when it comes to matters like the budget where we tend to all work on them together.

87
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:16,032
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's just going to be my vote.

88
00:08:16,553 --> 00:08:21,957
[SPEAKER_11]: But there may be other people who feel differently about some of the other subcommittees that are listed.

89
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:31,785
[SPEAKER_11]: And so there's one component of the request is just to hear from you all what you think the committee should be, the standing committees.

90
00:08:32,904 --> 00:08:39,448
[SPEAKER_11]: And then another piece for you to tell us what committees you want to be a part of.

91
00:08:39,609 --> 00:08:42,170
[SPEAKER_11]: So subcommittees are comprised of three members.

92
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:47,534
[SPEAKER_11]: They can't be comprised of more than three members, because then that represents a quorum of this larger committee.

93
00:08:47,914 --> 00:08:49,555
[SPEAKER_11]: And suddenly, you're not a subcommittee anymore.

94
00:08:49,575 --> 00:08:50,576
[SPEAKER_11]: You're actually just the committee.

95
00:08:51,496 --> 00:08:55,499
[SPEAKER_11]: So the subcommittees tend to do work that is sent there by this group.

96
00:08:57,182 --> 00:09:15,634
[SPEAKER_11]: You there, there are some sort of exceptions, but generally something comes to the floor and we say, we want to send this to subcommittee to be to, to, to do X, Y, or Z. And so the way I set up the request, um, after we had some discussion about it was to say, please tell us what, how you want to be involved in these committees.

97
00:09:15,694 --> 00:09:17,795
[SPEAKER_11]: Like you don't have to be involved in any committees.

98
00:09:18,556 --> 00:09:20,537
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, you could be involved in all of the committees.

99
00:09:21,277 --> 00:09:25,520
[SPEAKER_11]: It sort of depends on interest and time and all of that stuff.

100
00:09:26,035 --> 00:09:37,719
[SPEAKER_11]: But I also provided a place for people to say, I'd like to chair this committee, or I want to be on this committee, or I'm willing to be on this committee, which I think is just a little bit different.

101
00:09:37,779 --> 00:09:41,700
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I don't want to be on this committee for whatever reason.

102
00:09:42,304 --> 00:09:45,665
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we can get all those results and then take a look at it.

103
00:09:45,725 --> 00:09:52,888
[SPEAKER_11]: And in a future meeting, the mayor can present to us what her like proposed subcommittee structure is.

104
00:09:53,809 --> 00:09:56,990
[SPEAKER_11]: And based on that feedback, and then we can have some discussion.

105
00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:04,413
[SPEAKER_11]: We all ultimately have to vote on it, but it is just a good way for you all to say like, these are the topics that interest me.

106
00:10:05,933 --> 00:10:09,635
[SPEAKER_11]: It's okay for you to say, I want to be the chair of something, even if you've never done it before.

107
00:10:11,271 --> 00:10:13,013
[SPEAKER_11]: help you manage through those first ones.

108
00:10:13,093 --> 00:10:19,758
[SPEAKER_11]: Like the subcommittees are a really nice place to do that because they tend to be sort of confined topics.

109
00:10:19,778 --> 00:10:26,023
[SPEAKER_11]: Like you'll be working on a specific thing or reacting to something that came to you by the larger committee.

110
00:10:26,123 --> 00:10:28,846
[SPEAKER_11]: So you all have that, I think, in your email box.

111
00:10:28,886 --> 00:10:30,467
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you don't let me know and I'll send it.

112
00:10:31,528 --> 00:10:36,552
[SPEAKER_11]: But really it's just a chance for us to say like, are these even the right committees for us anymore?

113
00:10:36,712 --> 00:10:40,355
[SPEAKER_11]: If there's stuff you think we should be adding, like there's a space for you to do that too.

114
00:10:41,192 --> 00:10:46,656
[SPEAKER_11]: The high school building committee, completely separate topic and not part of what we're signing.

115
00:10:47,157 --> 00:10:47,297
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep.

116
00:10:47,477 --> 00:10:52,541
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for taking the lead on developing that survey.

117
00:10:52,561 --> 00:10:53,242
[SPEAKER_13]: Appreciate it.

118
00:10:53,402 --> 00:11:06,052
[SPEAKER_13]: And then I just also, if you want to either send it to me separately or within that survey, you want to outline what your first, second, third, fourth choices are, because even if you want it to be on all of them, you probably won't be because

119
00:11:06,485 --> 00:11:08,088
[SPEAKER_13]: I can only pick three per committee.

120
00:11:08,148 --> 00:11:14,257
[SPEAKER_13]: So I do try to do it as fairly as possible, where you'll chair one or two and then be on one or two others.

121
00:11:14,478 --> 00:11:17,042
[SPEAKER_13]: So please feel free to list your priorities as well.

122
00:11:18,203 --> 00:11:18,584
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

123
00:11:19,586 --> 00:11:19,806
[SPEAKER_04]: May I?

124
00:11:20,407 --> 00:11:21,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Member McLaughlin.

125
00:11:21,328 --> 00:11:21,908
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

126
00:11:21,948 --> 00:11:23,329
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, thank you, Member Graham, for this.

127
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:29,313
[SPEAKER_04]: This is, I think, a much more efficient way of looking at the process and having people weigh in.

128
00:11:29,393 --> 00:11:30,153
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's really helpful.

129
00:11:30,693 --> 00:11:33,735
[SPEAKER_04]: There's just a few committees that I don't recognize from before.

130
00:11:33,795 --> 00:11:40,059
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm wondering, I mean, I know the superintendent evaluation was an ad hoc committee that we had sort of added for one of our goals.

131
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:42,281
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the idea of keeping it, but I just see that.

132
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:46,683
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there was another, which was, I think strategic planning was the same idea.

133
00:11:47,124 --> 00:11:49,305
[SPEAKER_04]: And so are those ones that you guys have said,

134
00:11:49,901 --> 00:11:51,641
[SPEAKER_04]: you want to try to move forward with?

135
00:11:51,762 --> 00:11:53,922
[SPEAKER_04]: Or weren't those just unique to last year?

136
00:11:55,182 --> 00:12:08,726
[SPEAKER_11]: So last term, we basically took what previously was family engagement, communication, and strategic planning and separated it, which I think there's just too much going on there for it to be one topic.

137
00:12:08,806 --> 00:12:10,567
[SPEAKER_11]: So last term, we did separate it.

138
00:12:10,987 --> 00:12:11,787
[SPEAKER_11]: Both did meet.

139
00:12:12,507 --> 00:12:15,728
[SPEAKER_11]: There's at least one thing, I think, in strategic planning right now.

140
00:12:16,468 --> 00:12:19,169
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was just waiting to schedule something to, like,

141
00:12:19,522 --> 00:12:20,142
[SPEAKER_11]: move forward on that.

142
00:12:20,162 --> 00:12:24,184
[SPEAKER_11]: So I do think those two things, those two make sense to carry over from last year.

143
00:12:24,204 --> 00:12:28,647
[SPEAKER_11]: And I put superintendent evaluation on because it was an ad hoc last year.

144
00:12:28,687 --> 00:12:34,650
[SPEAKER_11]: But if, if we think that we want to continue with that process, we should just make it a standing committee so that there's some expectation there.

145
00:12:48,277 --> 00:12:50,838
[SPEAKER_04]: I just also wanted to put in for a point of information.

146
00:12:50,878 --> 00:13:05,002
[SPEAKER_04]: While anyone can request to be chair or on the committee, even after three school committee members are on a committee, other school committee members can attend the committee meeting.

147
00:13:05,882 --> 00:13:08,023
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just not able to weigh in, obviously, and vote.

148
00:13:08,283 --> 00:13:12,424
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can still attend and listen if there are ones that you're interested in.

149
00:13:13,264 --> 00:13:13,544
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

150
00:13:13,664 --> 00:13:14,004
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

151
00:13:15,005 --> 00:13:15,745
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep.

152
00:13:15,805 --> 00:13:16,345
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Reinfeld?

153
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:28,039
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I was curious, is there on our, I think there's a shared Google Drive that we got access to today, is there, does that have the archive of the meetings and kind of agendas of what these committees have done?

154
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:28,499
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

155
00:13:28,719 --> 00:13:29,500
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, great.

156
00:13:30,421 --> 00:13:30,661
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

157
00:13:32,884 --> 00:13:35,246
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I had one other topic.

158
00:13:35,426 --> 00:13:36,607
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

159
00:13:37,128 --> 00:13:42,593
[SPEAKER_11]: I reached out to me I see because they do a whole variety of training.

160
00:13:42,633 --> 00:13:48,559
[SPEAKER_11]: But one of the trainings that Tracy Novick will do on our for us is a training around Chapter 70.

161
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:54,084
[SPEAKER_11]: So Chapter 70 is how the state funds municipalities as it relates to education.

162
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:58,676
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a lot of changes happening in Chapter 70 because of the Student Opportunity Act.

163
00:13:58,716 --> 00:14:03,300
[SPEAKER_11]: And we're like maybe a little bit more than halfway through the full funding of Student Opportunity Act.

164
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,382
[SPEAKER_11]: But Chapter 70 funding is wildly complicated.

165
00:14:06,602 --> 00:14:10,485
[SPEAKER_11]: It's one piece of how our schools are funded in Medford.

166
00:14:11,386 --> 00:14:17,751
[SPEAKER_11]: But Tracy is willing to come and do a training session with us about Chapter 70.

167
00:14:17,951 --> 00:14:20,093
[SPEAKER_11]: And every time she does this talk, she picks

168
00:14:21,082 --> 00:14:22,083
[SPEAKER_11]: she picks a community.

169
00:14:22,103 --> 00:14:29,509
[SPEAKER_11]: So when you go to charting the course, you'll see her pick a community and then sort of dive through their chapter 70 and say, this is what's really happening.

170
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:30,891
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, this is what these numbers mean.

171
00:14:30,951 --> 00:14:32,192
[SPEAKER_11]: This is how this impacts them.

172
00:14:33,173 --> 00:14:42,260
[SPEAKER_11]: And every time I go and I listened to her do this chapter 70 talk, I'm like, she picked Medford because I would be really interested on her take on what is happening in chapter 70.

173
00:14:42,701 --> 00:14:44,722
[SPEAKER_11]: So I reached out to her.

174
00:14:44,742 --> 00:14:47,545
[SPEAKER_11]: She said, it's about like an hour and a half ish training.

175
00:14:48,306 --> 00:14:56,228
[SPEAKER_11]: And she has pretty open availability in the month of February, which I think is good timing for us to do that before budget season really starts.

176
00:14:58,208 --> 00:15:13,091
[SPEAKER_11]: And she I just told her that I would bring it to the group and we could decide if there was a date and time that would work well, but I think it's a nice sort of lead into the budget discussions which will become just a huge part of what we're doing here soon so.

177
00:15:14,189 --> 00:15:21,014
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the question is really around scheduling and whether we want to try to find a time to do that as a group, not knowing.

178
00:15:21,114 --> 00:15:27,999
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the other thing that would be helpful, I think, for all of us is to know generally when are people available?

179
00:15:28,099 --> 00:15:29,720
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you start a meeting at 5 or 6?

180
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:32,682
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you not available at all on Wednesdays?

181
00:15:32,762 --> 00:15:38,986
[SPEAKER_11]: Those kinds of things I think maybe we should try to understand better across this new committee, because I think you learn that over time.

182
00:15:40,816 --> 00:15:50,178
[SPEAKER_11]: In the meantime, to schedule this, I think we would just need some date options that we could bring to Tracy and see if she can plan to come in and do this training for us on one of those dates.

183
00:15:51,219 --> 00:15:51,619
[SPEAKER_11]: Sounds great.

184
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:52,439
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Member Graham.

185
00:15:53,939 --> 00:15:54,260
[SPEAKER_04]: Mayor?

186
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,500
[SPEAKER_04]: Member McLaughlin.

187
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:56,520
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

188
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:02,362
[SPEAKER_04]: For the good of the order as well, I just wanted to bring up the school committee goals.

189
00:16:02,402 --> 00:16:03,222
[SPEAKER_04]: I know we're talking about

190
00:16:04,591 --> 00:16:13,358
[SPEAKER_04]: Superintendent goals tonight, and I do think that we need to review school committee goals and have it on the agenda and talk about I think we had two goals last year.

191
00:16:13,378 --> 00:16:21,544
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think we should, you know, talk about those and How we did on them and then think about what goals.

192
00:16:21,644 --> 00:16:24,126
[SPEAKER_04]: This committee might want to set moving forward.

193
00:16:25,266 --> 00:16:28,629
[SPEAKER_04]: So that just sort of something under the good of the order, but I don't know if we want to

194
00:16:29,386 --> 00:16:35,108
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have an idea, Superintendent, on when you might wanna put that, or Mayor, on when you might wanna put that on the agenda.

195
00:16:35,588 --> 00:16:44,090
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that was the school committee goals, so we can discuss it amongst the committee, or decide tonight, maybe the second meeting, or first meeting in February.

196
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:44,650
Okay.

197
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:48,631
[SPEAKER_13]: And everybody can have about a month to think through what the goals are.

198
00:16:48,651 --> 00:16:54,433
[SPEAKER_13]: In the meantime, maybe somebody from the admin can just send us the two goals we chose last year, so the new members have them.

199
00:16:55,713 --> 00:16:56,093
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

200
00:16:57,714 --> 00:16:57,854
[SPEAKER_13]: Great.

201
00:16:59,070 --> 00:16:59,350
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

202
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:09,652
[SPEAKER_11]: We have the consent agenda, bills and- Before you go on, we probably should have started with like what the good of the order is in case you, the new folks don't know.

203
00:17:09,712 --> 00:17:11,413
[SPEAKER_03]: You did tell us our first meeting we attended.

204
00:17:11,813 --> 00:17:12,473
[SPEAKER_11]: It would be weird.

205
00:17:12,533 --> 00:17:12,653
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

206
00:17:12,693 --> 00:17:13,593
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

207
00:17:13,613 --> 00:17:13,973
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, no.

208
00:17:13,993 --> 00:17:14,333
[SPEAKER_11]: You said it.

209
00:17:14,413 --> 00:17:14,873
[SPEAKER_11]: You told us.

210
00:17:14,893 --> 00:17:15,393
[SPEAKER_13]: You told us.

211
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:16,254
[SPEAKER_13]: You explained it.

212
00:17:16,334 --> 00:17:16,674
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

213
00:17:16,774 --> 00:17:17,114
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

214
00:17:17,154 --> 00:17:17,534
[SPEAKER_11]: Good, good, good.

215
00:17:17,654 --> 00:17:17,834
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

216
00:17:18,274 --> 00:17:21,855
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted to make sure like we're not leaving you in the dust as we explain.

217
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:22,055
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

218
00:17:22,595 --> 00:17:23,435
[SPEAKER_11]: But I appreciate that leaving us.

219
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:25,256
[SPEAKER_13]: We've been out of it suit too for a while.

220
00:17:25,336 --> 00:17:26,876
[SPEAKER_13]: So please let us know if you need us to

221
00:17:28,011 --> 00:17:30,012
[SPEAKER_13]: Help out on that front as well.

222
00:17:37,817 --> 00:17:47,242
[SPEAKER_13]: My first few weeks in office, I went home and just with my head spinning on all the acronyms, then COVID had snapped me into reality.

223
00:17:47,522 --> 00:17:48,062
[SPEAKER_13]: Figured it out.

224
00:17:48,082 --> 00:17:50,043
[SPEAKER_13]: I figured it out.

225
00:17:50,724 --> 00:17:50,904
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

226
00:17:52,119 --> 00:17:58,162
[SPEAKER_13]: So we do have the consent agenda, bills and payrolls, regular school committee minutes, December 18th, 2023.

227
00:18:00,863 --> 00:18:03,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to sever the minutes from December 18th.

228
00:18:03,604 --> 00:18:06,245
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion to sever the consent agenda.

00:18:06,905 --> 00:18:08,386

[SPEAKER_13]: I'll start with bills and payrolls.

236
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:19,731
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there a motion for approval on bills and payrolls?

[SPEAKER_13]: Now we have the regular school committee meeting minutes from December 18th, 2023.

245
00:18:34,483 --> 00:18:38,626
[SPEAKER_03]: I motion to approve these with the correction of the spelling of my name.

[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes as amended.

251
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:56,569
[SPEAKER_13]: We do not have any reports of subcommittees.

252
00:18:57,090 --> 00:19:02,836
[SPEAKER_13]: We have seven reports under the superintendent's updates.

253
00:19:03,717 --> 00:19:06,399
[SPEAKER_13]: First is the superintendent's updates and comments.

254
00:19:06,499 --> 00:19:07,681

00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:10,850
[SPEAKER_07]: Good evening and Happy New Year.

256
00:19:11,731 --> 00:19:20,338
[SPEAKER_07]: I would like to begin by welcoming our three new school committee members, Nicole Branley, Erin Olapade, and Erica Reinfeld.

257
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:29,265
[SPEAKER_07]: I know I speak for the entire Medford Public Schools community when I offer our warmest welcome, congratulations, and best wishes.

258
00:19:30,726 --> 00:19:32,027
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome back to the committee.

259
00:19:32,628 --> 00:19:37,712
[SPEAKER_07]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn, Member Graham, Member McLaughlin, and Member Ruseau.

260
00:19:38,353 --> 00:19:43,457
[SPEAKER_07]: I look forward to continuing our innovative work together for the Medford Public Schools.

261
00:19:45,376 --> 00:19:53,665
[SPEAKER_07]: Because of the weekend snowstorm, the city's formal inauguration ceremony has been rescheduled to this Wednesday at 6pm.

262
00:19:54,807 --> 00:20:04,598
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm looking forward to joining everyone to celebrate public service and the start of the new term for our mayor, city counselors and school committee members.

263
00:20:08,194 --> 00:20:11,036
[SPEAKER_07]: Now transitioning to school affairs.

264
00:20:12,276 --> 00:20:15,518
[SPEAKER_07]: Kindergarten registration, it's a critically important time.

265
00:20:16,218 --> 00:20:21,561
[SPEAKER_07]: This is very, very important for how our elementary schools function.

266
00:20:22,802 --> 00:20:32,767
[SPEAKER_07]: So kindergarten registration for the 24-25 school year opens on Tuesday next week, January 16th, one week from tomorrow.

267
00:20:34,665 --> 00:20:51,400
[SPEAKER_07]: If you know a caregiver of a child who will be starting kindergarten next year, please let them know they are invited to attend one of the upcoming informational sessions to learn about our kindergarten program and have the opportunity to ask questions directly.

268
00:20:52,521 --> 00:20:55,724
[SPEAKER_07]: So the meeting next week in person

[SPEAKER_07]: The February meeting on Tuesday, February 27th, that meeting will also take place at 6.30 p.m.

00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,180

275
00:21:38,345 --> 00:21:46,813
[SPEAKER_07]: critically important, please spread the word so we can get accurate numbers of our kindergarten students, and for the new members that are here today.

276
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:56,283
[SPEAKER_07]: This past school year we had an unusual rush in August, increased kindergarten enrollment.

277
00:21:56,943 --> 00:22:01,664
[SPEAKER_07]: that we were required to open for additional kindergarten sessions.

278
00:22:02,324 --> 00:22:08,086
[SPEAKER_07]: So to the best of your ability, we're going to really try to make sure we register our kindergartners earlier.

279
00:22:08,906 --> 00:22:22,230
[SPEAKER_07]: I do want the community to also know that during our information sessions, child care and interpretation services will be available at those meetings, and more information will be available on our school website.

280
00:22:24,292 --> 00:22:29,197
[SPEAKER_07]: Another wonderful topic to just share some key highlights with you is in the area of athletics.

281
00:22:30,598 --> 00:22:43,733
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to do the special recognition Medford High School's girls soccer team received national recognition by United soccer coaches.

282
00:22:45,194 --> 00:23:06,883
[SPEAKER_07]: We received a silver level team ethics and sportsmanship award across the country 72 fall season boys and girls teams received either the platinum gold, silver or bronze version of the high school team ethics and sportsmanship award.

283
00:23:07,723 --> 00:23:24,252
[SPEAKER_07]: which recognizes teams that exhibit fair play, sporting behavior, and adherence to the laws of the game, as reflected by the number of yellow caution cards or red ejection cards.

284
00:23:25,033 --> 00:23:28,314
[SPEAKER_07]: They are shown by referees throughout the season.

285
00:23:29,795 --> 00:23:31,776
[SPEAKER_07]: Medford girls soccer was one of 31 teams

286
00:23:34,218 --> 00:23:41,255
[SPEAKER_07]: that claimed the silver award, which is given to teams that accumulate a percentage of cards, ranging from 11 to 30%.

287
00:23:44,867 --> 00:23:53,553
[SPEAKER_07]: Only nine other Massachusetts teams were recognized with team ethics and sportsmanship awards this year.

288
00:23:54,894 --> 00:24:07,562
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to send a special congratulations to coach Marco Siri, to our captains, Vivalyn Chavitana, who's grade 12, Josiah Kuyate, grade 11,

289
00:24:08,703 --> 00:24:19,591
[SPEAKER_07]: Grace Mastromatteo, grade 12, and Isabella O'Brien, grade 12, and all members of the varsity and junior varsity teams.

290
00:24:21,092 --> 00:24:32,800
[SPEAKER_07]: For the winter athletic season, our teams are off to a great start, and we're proudly cheering on our basketball, swimming, track, hockey, and gymnastics teams.

[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Dr. Edward Vincent.

327
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:57,552
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a question about the public school monitoring.

328
00:28:58,893 --> 00:29:05,876
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it said that all families of students with disabilities will be contacted with that information.

329
00:29:06,236 --> 00:29:07,336
[SPEAKER_04]: How are they being contacted?

330
00:29:08,897 --> 00:29:09,077
[SPEAKER_07]: Ms.

331
00:29:09,117 --> 00:29:10,498
[SPEAKER_07]: Bowen, can you please come forward?

332
00:29:10,538 --> 00:29:10,858
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

333
00:29:22,078 --> 00:29:22,418
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it on.

334
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:22,799
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

335
00:29:23,379 --> 00:29:34,973
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, so we had to provide Jesse with a roster of all students with disabilities, and they'll be contacted via email we were only allowed to provide one parent name and one parent email.

336
00:29:35,433 --> 00:29:36,755
[SPEAKER_08]: Those went out last week.

337
00:29:37,175 --> 00:29:42,161
[SPEAKER_08]: If you don't receive them I'm asking parents to contact me or you can contact

338
00:29:42,521 --> 00:29:53,084
[SPEAKER_08]: The desi program reviewer Joan Birkenhoff, who, her information is listed on our website with the update regarding the tiered focus monitoring visit.

339
00:29:53,904 --> 00:29:54,305
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

340
00:29:54,425 --> 00:30:01,587
[SPEAKER_04]: And so to be clear, it's parent email, not through the students portal or school directly to the parents email.

341
00:30:01,707 --> 00:30:01,967
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

342
00:30:03,427 --> 00:30:04,128
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

343
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:12,110
[SPEAKER_13]: We have number two leadership for social change pre college program accessibility to

344
00:30:12,472 --> 00:30:14,254
[SPEAKER_13]: Performing Arts, Ms.

345
00:30:14,294 --> 00:30:16,576
[SPEAKER_13]: Tegan The Stone, MHS graduate from 2023.

346
00:30:16,696 --> 00:30:17,497
[SPEAKER_13]: Welcome, Tegan.

347
00:30:18,959 --> 00:30:20,060
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for having me.

348
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:21,101
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

349
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:25,725
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I was going to mention that, but yes, I am a graduate from this June, so not too long.

350
00:30:26,446 --> 00:30:32,292
[SPEAKER_10]: But good evening, mayor, superintendent, school committee members, school administrators, and committee members joining us from Zoom.

351
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:36,363
[SPEAKER_10]: My name is Tegan Westone, and I'm a graduate from the Medford High School class of 2023.

352
00:30:36,863 --> 00:30:42,468
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for making time for me tonight to shine a light on accessibility to the arts in Medford Public Schools.

353
00:30:43,749 --> 00:30:49,554
[SPEAKER_10]: So a year and a half ago, I attended a lovely Tufts pre-college program entitled Leadership for Social Change.

354
00:30:50,115 --> 00:30:59,963
[SPEAKER_10]: And at this two-week program in July, I attended classes and lectures by Tufts professors focused on coalition building, social barriers, and of course, community activism.

355
00:31:01,274 --> 00:31:07,416
[SPEAKER_10]: This is all thanks to the generosity of Marilyn Blumstack and each year she supports a Medford student with a scholarship to this program.

356
00:31:07,897 --> 00:31:13,419
[SPEAKER_10]: She's a true agent of change in our community and responsible for cultivating a more civically minded student body.

357
00:31:13,899 --> 00:31:16,240
[SPEAKER_10]: And luckily she and her granddaughter are here tonight.

358
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:17,580
[SPEAKER_10]: So just give her a round of applause.

359
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,140
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

360
00:31:25,734 --> 00:31:33,075
[SPEAKER_10]: So over the course of the program, I created an action plan with the guide of the directors to address an issue in my own community of my choosing.

361
00:31:33,675 --> 00:31:40,056
[SPEAKER_10]: I decided to focus on a place I knew very well, classroom A125, the music room of Medford High School.

362
00:31:40,597 --> 00:31:45,998
[SPEAKER_10]: My project targeted increasing accessibility to the performing arts with the focus of the marching band and concert band.

363
00:31:46,838 --> 00:31:54,399
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the lessons of the pre-college program was an asset-based approach, harnessing the resources in the community to create a sustainable social change.

364
00:31:55,472 --> 00:31:58,834
[SPEAKER_10]: The Medford arts community was already home to passionate and hardworking students.

365
00:31:59,575 --> 00:32:03,297
[SPEAKER_10]: And I knew that effective change would not be possible without their vision and determination.

366
00:32:05,198 --> 00:32:11,502
[SPEAKER_10]: One element of this initiative that I'd like to point out is an elementary and middle school music camp during February break and summer vacation.

367
00:32:12,342 --> 00:32:19,607
[SPEAKER_10]: These camps were offered completely free of charge to the Medford public school students, thanks to the hard work of the music band and orchestra teachers of this district.

368
00:32:20,589 --> 00:32:23,310
[SPEAKER_10]: They're also possible because of the vision and determination of Ms.

369
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:26,772
[SPEAKER_10]: Haley Rallo, the band director, one of my role models and biggest supporters.

370
00:32:28,052 --> 00:32:31,334
[SPEAKER_10]: In addition, the camps were run by dozens of high school student volunteers.

371
00:32:32,074 --> 00:32:36,917
[SPEAKER_10]: The upperclassmen made these camps exciting by sharing the love of music and giving personal attention to students.

372
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:46,441
[SPEAKER_10]: The best part of the performance at the end of each camp was seeing a stage full of students from all different schools, backgrounds, and social classes playing together in harmony.

373
00:32:47,571 --> 00:32:54,093
[SPEAKER_10]: The umbrella of performing arts also includes the drama club, choir, and percussion ensemble that were once a part of the vibrant MHS community.

374
00:32:54,953 --> 00:33:01,635
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe that reestablishing these programs in post-COVID times are important by hiring more music and arts teachers.

375
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:05,516
[SPEAKER_10]: And this should be a priority for the next fiscal year, if I might ask.

376
00:33:06,451 --> 00:33:09,834
[SPEAKER_10]: I also understand the importance of a dedicated and full-time staff to music programs.

377
00:33:10,515 --> 00:33:12,837
[SPEAKER_10]: Currently, the only paid staff for the marching band are Ms.

378
00:33:12,857 --> 00:33:13,637
[SPEAKER_10]: Haley Rallo and Ms.

379
00:33:13,677 --> 00:33:14,298
[SPEAKER_10]: Jackie Gaffney.

380
00:33:15,138 --> 00:33:20,383
[SPEAKER_10]: This past season, five recent high school graduates joined the staff as volunteers to lead the percussion staff.

381
00:33:21,324 --> 00:33:25,948
[SPEAKER_10]: And I believe going forward, all who put time and effort to this program deserve a stipend, if only small.

382
00:33:26,929 --> 00:33:30,972
[SPEAKER_10]: Despite all odds, the marching band took first place in New England Regional Competition in 2023,

383
00:33:32,389 --> 00:33:35,090
[SPEAKER_10]: And this season marked a new chapter of the performing arts in Medford.

384
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:38,871
[SPEAKER_10]: It was more diverse, more welcoming, and more powerful than ever.

385
00:33:39,712 --> 00:33:42,353
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope that you will continue this momentum and help the marching band.

386
00:33:43,193 --> 00:33:45,234
[SPEAKER_10]: And before I end, I would like to especially thank Ms.

387
00:33:45,254 --> 00:33:50,136
[SPEAKER_10]: Stacey Schulman, the director of school counseling and behavioral health, for her assistance and leadership through this program.

388
00:33:50,776 --> 00:33:55,538
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for having me tonight, and I look forward to another successful year in the performing arts open for all students.

389
00:33:56,338 --> 00:33:56,598
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

390
00:34:04,232 --> 00:34:10,517
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to say thank you so much again for coming back to share your report with us.

391
00:34:11,398 --> 00:34:23,469
[SPEAKER_07]: Would you mind, and I want to just once again thank Miss Marilyn bloom sack for your generosity, your partnership your collaboration with the Medford public schools, and you're continuing to do it.

392
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:26,892
[SPEAKER_07]: This presentation that I didn't say at the beginning.

393
00:34:27,552 --> 00:34:31,958
[SPEAKER_07]: is a little deferred because you are out of the country.

394
00:34:31,998 --> 00:34:36,663
[SPEAKER_07]: Would you mind sharing with the committee your wonderful learning experience?

395
00:34:36,923 --> 00:34:38,225
[SPEAKER_10]: I definitely can.

396
00:34:38,245 --> 00:34:46,675
[SPEAKER_10]: So this program opened my eyes to Tufts and how powerful it is to our community, especially because I'm a, I would say I'm a Medford resident first, a Tufts student second.

397
00:34:47,208 --> 00:34:56,493
[SPEAKER_10]: And this year was my first semester at Tufts, and I went abroad to Peru, which is a part of Tisch College, which is the umbrella that this program, Leadership for Social Change, is also directed under.

398
00:34:56,893 --> 00:35:01,995
[SPEAKER_10]: So not only had I known some of the staff when I went away for my first semester at Tufts, thanks to Ms.

399
00:35:02,075 --> 00:35:07,098
[SPEAKER_10]: Blumstack, but also I just had amazing civic-engaged experience abroad.

400
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:09,364
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much.

401
00:35:09,584 --> 00:35:11,965
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just also wanted to say thank you again.

402
00:35:26,371 --> 00:35:30,713
[SPEAKER_07]: student that's receiving this special scholarship to participate in this program.

403
00:35:31,013 --> 00:35:35,776
[SPEAKER_07]: And we look forward to hearing her presentation at the end of the school year.

404
00:35:36,076 --> 00:35:39,918
[SPEAKER_07]: But thank you, and thank you for sharing your wonderful learning with us.

405
00:35:43,479 --> 00:35:44,100
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, thank you.

406
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:46,361
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Ms.

407
00:35:46,401 --> 00:35:46,841
[SPEAKER_13]: Bonsack.

408
00:35:50,483 --> 00:35:52,203
[SPEAKER_13]: We have our school update.

409
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:55,505
[SPEAKER_13]: Roberts Elementary School Principal, Michelle Crow.

410
00:36:01,374 --> 00:36:01,614
[SPEAKER_12]: Welcome.

411
00:36:04,256 --> 00:36:04,637
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

412
00:36:12,203 --> 00:36:12,663
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

413
00:36:12,983 --> 00:36:18,408
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for having me here tonight to share the amazing happenings at the Roberts School.

414
00:36:20,574 --> 00:36:27,739
[SPEAKER_00]: As I transitioned into the role of principal at the Roberts, we started the school year with a popsicles with the principal event.

415
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:39,328
[SPEAKER_00]: This was an event that the entire Roberts School community was invited to, and it was an opportunity for me to meet with parents, caregivers, and students.

416
00:36:40,428 --> 00:36:47,093
[SPEAKER_00]: With the help of my PTO, we purchased about 600 popsicles, which I thought was, wow, 600.

417
00:36:49,226 --> 00:36:54,570
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, by 645, we had no more popsicles left.

418
00:36:55,891 --> 00:36:58,553
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that point, I was like, this is it.

419
00:36:59,174 --> 00:37:00,595
[SPEAKER_00]: The families were amazing.

420
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:02,476
[SPEAKER_00]: This became a whole family event for me.

421
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:04,398
[SPEAKER_00]: My husband was passing out popsicles.

422
00:37:04,478 --> 00:37:06,219
[SPEAKER_00]: My boys were passing out popsicles.

423
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:12,004
[SPEAKER_00]: As I walked around the playground and met our students and families.

424
00:37:12,224 --> 00:37:18,529
[SPEAKER_00]: So our school year started off on a really positive note with this event that was held in the summer.

425
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:19,859
[SPEAKER_00]: right at the playground.

426
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:31,482
[SPEAKER_00]: As the school year started, we identified a set of four core values that directly related to responsive classroom.

427
00:37:32,582 --> 00:37:36,303
[SPEAKER_00]: These core values are kind of what we live by at the Roberts School.

428
00:37:37,403 --> 00:37:39,083
[SPEAKER_00]: We say them every single day.

429
00:37:39,743 --> 00:37:47,485
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all around our school, and those words are be kind, be responsible, be respectful, and be safe.

430
00:37:48,888 --> 00:37:52,591
[SPEAKER_00]: These core values are discussed during our daily morning meetings in our classrooms.

431
00:37:54,072 --> 00:38:01,417
[SPEAKER_00]: They're posted in the hallways, they're posted in the cafeteria, they're posted in the main office, they're posted everywhere.

432
00:38:01,517 --> 00:38:09,023
[SPEAKER_00]: And our kids know, and our kids talk about it, and they'll say, you are being so kind today, and I am being responsible.

433
00:38:09,884 --> 00:38:17,069
[SPEAKER_00]: So the kids are getting it, and it's teaching them how to be responsible citizens.

434
00:38:18,638 --> 00:38:21,740
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, we recite them every single day on our morning announcements.

435
00:38:25,904 --> 00:38:33,710
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm super excited to kind of introduce to you a new initiative that is currently in full swing at the Roberts School right now.

436
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:37,052
[SPEAKER_00]: It's our Schoolwide Mascot Symbol Project.

437
00:38:37,873 --> 00:38:44,198
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a fully student-led project that has been incorporated into the students' weekly art classes.

438
00:38:45,427 --> 00:38:50,652
[SPEAKER_00]: The students have been working with Miss Diorio, our art teacher, on learning about logos.

439
00:38:51,133 --> 00:38:53,295
[SPEAKER_00]: So this project started with what is a logo?

440
00:38:54,232 --> 00:39:08,363
[SPEAKER_00]: So she pulled various school logos, company logos, they looked at lettering, they looked at coloring, and students had to design a mascot or symbol that reflects our values as a school.

441
00:39:09,064 --> 00:39:16,810
[SPEAKER_00]: So part of the assignment wasn't just to draw a symbol, but really, what does this symbol mean in relation to our values?

442
00:39:18,936 --> 00:39:23,278
[SPEAKER_00]: We are now in the process of developing a teacher student committee.

443
00:39:24,258 --> 00:39:34,703
[SPEAKER_00]: This committee will meet, we have hundreds of entries into this project, so our teacher and student committee will be meeting to

444
00:39:35,923 --> 00:39:37,606
[SPEAKER_00]: narrow down our choices.

445
00:39:38,166 --> 00:39:40,630
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we can narrow down to a top five.

446
00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:48,440
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to go to a whole school wide assembly and students will be voting on the new mascot or symbol of the Robert school.

447
00:39:49,521 --> 00:39:49,621
[SPEAKER_00]: Um,

448
00:39:50,672 --> 00:39:58,759
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see on this slide, this is a sneak peek of a few of our entries.

449
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:04,543
[SPEAKER_00]: So our top right corner, this is one that a student drew.

450
00:40:04,563 --> 00:40:06,045
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe this is a second grader.

451
00:40:06,725 --> 00:40:09,267
[SPEAKER_00]: So their idea is the Robert School Gators.

452
00:40:09,868 --> 00:40:12,370
[SPEAKER_00]: So in their research, they saw that a lot of symbols

453
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:17,353
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of were in this circular shape with the illustration in the middle.

454
00:40:17,373 --> 00:40:21,015
[SPEAKER_00]: So possibly we could be the Robert School Gators.

455
00:40:22,315 --> 00:40:26,538
[SPEAKER_00]: The bottom left corner was the Robert School Lions.

456
00:40:26,958 --> 00:40:33,442
[SPEAKER_00]: So this student in particular was really into color design, so super colorful on the mane of the lion.

457
00:40:34,847 --> 00:40:39,648
[SPEAKER_00]: In the bottom right corner, there's a few of these lingering around the Roberts School.

458
00:40:39,668 --> 00:40:44,729
[SPEAKER_00]: The Roberts School goats, because the Roberts School is the greatest school of all time.

459
00:40:44,909 --> 00:40:57,911
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are just a sneak peek of what we've got, and hopefully it will go to a school-wide vote sometime in February.

460
00:40:58,651 --> 00:41:03,952
[SPEAKER_00]: The next new addition to the Roberts School this year have been student-led morning announcements.

461
00:41:05,023 --> 00:41:10,908
[SPEAKER_00]: Every day, students in grades K through five have the opportunity to lead the announcements.

462
00:41:12,549 --> 00:41:22,236
[SPEAKER_00]: During this time, students will say the Pledge of Allegiance, they share important announcements, present the lunch menu, various fun facts, guess the state, joke of the day.

463
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:27,821
[SPEAKER_00]: This has become such an exciting part of the day.

464
00:41:28,841 --> 00:41:31,864
[SPEAKER_00]: Kids keep me on my toes, so usually I do the announcements about 8.45.

465
00:41:31,944 --> 00:41:32,924
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm at 8.46, where's Mrs. Kroll?

466
00:41:35,875 --> 00:41:40,901
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they're so excited to see who is going to be doing the morning announcements for the day.

467
00:41:41,922 --> 00:41:46,727
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been pretty fantastic to see the student growth throughout the year so far.

468
00:41:47,208 --> 00:41:54,396
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we started with the student-led morning announcements, we started with fifth grade, we went down to fourth, third, two, one.

469
00:41:55,034 --> 00:41:57,396
[SPEAKER_00]: K, so our earliest readers.

470
00:41:58,096 --> 00:42:03,040
[SPEAKER_00]: When we got to kindergarten, they had seen and heard the models of their peers in the school.

471
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:06,482
[SPEAKER_00]: They also kind of knew some of the things that just always stay.

472
00:42:06,622 --> 00:42:08,544
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, good morning, Robert School.

473
00:42:09,765 --> 00:42:11,206
[SPEAKER_00]: Please stand for the Pledge of Allegiance.

474
00:42:11,266 --> 00:42:12,466
[SPEAKER_00]: So they knew the Pledge of Allegiance.

475
00:42:12,506 --> 00:42:15,409
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we always do, please stand for a moment of personal thought.

476
00:42:16,369 --> 00:42:16,850
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

477
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:18,991
[SPEAKER_00]: So they knew all of these parts.

478
00:42:19,071 --> 00:42:21,733
[SPEAKER_00]: So our kindergartners got right involved in the rotation.

479
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:30,779
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also been pretty interesting to see how kids are applying what they're learning in their literacy class into their oral reading.

480
00:42:31,448 --> 00:42:40,670
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect example, when we got to our grade two rotation, my second graders were the most excited students when they were doing their morning announcements.

481
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:44,571
[SPEAKER_00]: So the students would say, good morning, Robert school.

482
00:42:45,192 --> 00:42:48,812
[SPEAKER_00]: Today is pajama day, super excited.

483
00:42:49,453 --> 00:42:55,734
[SPEAKER_00]: So I said to my second grade teachers, wow, your students are reading with such emotion.

484
00:42:55,754 --> 00:42:58,355
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said, yes, because we're doing our unit on exclamation points.

485
00:42:58,855 --> 00:43:06,880
[SPEAKER_00]: So students were taking what they were learning in the classroom and applying it directly to real life situations within our school.

486
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:07,861
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fantastic.

487
00:43:11,663 --> 00:43:20,749
[SPEAKER_00]: Another new thing, new to the Roberts School, Mr. DiClemente and I have started responsive classroom whole grade assemblies.

488
00:43:21,977 --> 00:43:29,078
[SPEAKER_00]: We run three 45-minute assemblies per month, and this focuses directly on the real-life application of our core values.

489
00:43:30,059 --> 00:43:36,940
[SPEAKER_00]: So our teachers are teaching about core values, and Mr. D. Kalente and I are really teaching them, like, how do we actually put that into practice?

490
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:47,742
[SPEAKER_00]: In September, we focused on what is kindness and identified the importance of inclusion and kindness at school and in their daily lives.

491
00:43:48,945 --> 00:43:51,887
[SPEAKER_00]: We read the book, We're All Wonders by RJ Palacio.

492
00:43:52,868 --> 00:43:58,392
[SPEAKER_00]: Students had the opportunity to turn and talk with their peers, and then they shared out.

493
00:43:58,572 --> 00:44:10,841
[SPEAKER_00]: So we provided the students with the sentence starter, so I can be kind by, and then they talked about asking a friend to play on the playground, but they were making that connection about kindness and how do they actually be kind.

494
00:44:12,648 --> 00:44:14,749
[SPEAKER_00]: October is National Bullying Prevention Month.

495
00:44:15,229 --> 00:44:25,515
[SPEAKER_00]: So during our responsive classroom assembly, we continued our discussion on kindness, but with a focus on being an upstander instead of a bystander, if they see bullying occur.

496
00:44:26,255 --> 00:44:31,118
[SPEAKER_00]: We then played a game where students focused on what is alike with their peers.

497
00:44:31,138 --> 00:44:33,159
[SPEAKER_00]: So we played a game called Find Someone Who.

498
00:44:35,478 --> 00:44:46,924
[SPEAKER_00]: The November responsive classroom assembly, we continued to discuss bullying, but we also did a super fantastic activity about spreading kindness like confetti around school.

499
00:44:48,105 --> 00:44:55,109
[SPEAKER_00]: Each student received a colored sticky note and wrote messages of positivity for students around the school and for staff.

500
00:44:56,269 --> 00:45:04,674
[SPEAKER_00]: They left the sticky notes on lockers, in the teacher's room, in the nurse's office, and students found them as the day went on.

501
00:45:07,957 --> 00:45:11,820
[SPEAKER_00]: Our next slide just kind of shows our red box.

502
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:16,002
[SPEAKER_00]: This is me working with some first graders where they're presenting out to their grade level.

503
00:45:17,123 --> 00:45:21,166
[SPEAKER_00]: The middle box is Mr. D. Clemente reading to a group of fifth graders.

504
00:45:22,086 --> 00:45:29,271
[SPEAKER_00]: In this particular assembly, we were talking about what is it like to make sure that our peers are feeling included in a sense of belonging in everything that we do.

505
00:45:30,393 --> 00:45:36,139
[SPEAKER_00]: And then our brown box are some of the sticky notes, the spreading kindness.

506
00:45:36,239 --> 00:45:40,864
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it can be hard to read, but I've got a couple for you.

507
00:45:41,545 --> 00:45:43,607
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, kids didn't do any research here.

508
00:45:43,647 --> 00:45:46,770
[SPEAKER_00]: This was just their thoughts on kindness.

509
00:45:47,491 --> 00:45:48,832
[SPEAKER_00]: You brighten my day.

510
00:45:50,094 --> 00:45:51,075
[SPEAKER_00]: You are awesome.

511
00:45:52,196 --> 00:45:52,977
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep smiling.

512
00:45:53,857 --> 00:45:57,322
[SPEAKER_00]: And this last one I found outside of a kindergarten classroom.

513
00:45:57,743 --> 00:46:03,833
[SPEAKER_00]: And the student wrote, let your smile change the world, but don't let the world change your smile.

514
00:46:04,730 --> 00:46:08,671
[SPEAKER_00]: So throughout the school, kids found these all over.

515
00:46:08,691 --> 00:46:17,073
[SPEAKER_00]: And it truly brought a sense of just overwhelming happiness across the school.

516
00:46:17,193 --> 00:46:19,134
[SPEAKER_00]: Kids, you know, did you get a sticky note?

517
00:46:19,214 --> 00:46:20,474
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you see this sticky note?

518
00:46:20,534 --> 00:46:21,834
[SPEAKER_00]: Mine said I was awesome.

519
00:46:22,715 --> 00:46:24,375
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were given by their peers.

520
00:46:24,395 --> 00:46:27,496
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was a fantastic activity that we completed.

521
00:46:30,359 --> 00:46:36,624
[SPEAKER_00]: Continuing on with the theme of kindness, I wanna highlight the amazing work of my fifth grade student council members.

522
00:46:38,005 --> 00:46:41,428
[SPEAKER_00]: All fifth grade students have the opportunity to sign up for student council.

523
00:46:42,649 --> 00:46:47,013
[SPEAKER_00]: Student council meetings take place once a week on Thursdays during the school day.

524
00:46:48,514 --> 00:46:54,839
[SPEAKER_00]: Every month they organize one civic or community learning project and one school-wide theme day.

525
00:46:56,095 --> 00:47:00,018
[SPEAKER_00]: All community projects and theme days are totally determined by the students.

526
00:47:00,578 --> 00:47:07,203
[SPEAKER_00]: So at our meeting, we talk about what are some of the things that we can do to give back to our own school or to the city of Medford.

527
00:47:08,244 --> 00:47:11,766
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what kind of fun theme day can we do throughout the month?

528
00:47:13,167 --> 00:47:21,253
[SPEAKER_00]: The students are responsible for organizing the activity and communicating to the entire school community through posters and after school announcements.

529
00:47:23,143 --> 00:47:27,284
[SPEAKER_00]: Attending student council meetings have been the highlight of my day.

530
00:47:27,965 --> 00:47:32,906
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my calendar, this is a weekly meeting that I have set in my calendar every Thursday at 11 o'clock.

531
00:47:33,807 --> 00:47:44,190
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually tend not as the principal of the Roberts, but I am the support staff for the students in my connections program that have signed up to be on my student council.

532
00:47:45,210 --> 00:47:52,713
[SPEAKER_00]: And being able to participate with these group of kids has been amazing.

533
00:47:53,442 --> 00:47:59,424
[SPEAKER_00]: The thoughts that they have about how to give back to our community are on point.

534
00:48:00,104 --> 00:48:03,446
[SPEAKER_00]: They know, they know how to be kind and they know where the need is.

535
00:48:04,226 --> 00:48:06,687
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're coming up with fantastic ideas.

536
00:48:06,747 --> 00:48:15,710
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're still determining our January community project and our theme day, but I can tell you they're already super impressive on some of the ideas that they have.

537
00:48:16,932 --> 00:48:17,813
[SPEAKER_00]: A few examples.

538
00:48:18,414 --> 00:48:22,058
[SPEAKER_00]: During the month of October and November, students at the Roberts organized a food drive.

539
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:26,344
[SPEAKER_00]: Students decorated the boxes, they delivered everything to classrooms.

540
00:48:27,024 --> 00:48:31,169
[SPEAKER_00]: During weekly meetings, students collected the donations, packaged them up for delivery.

541
00:48:31,830 --> 00:48:35,334
[SPEAKER_00]: And prior to Thanksgiving, the Roberts delivered a generous amount of food to St.

542
00:48:35,395 --> 00:48:36,516
[SPEAKER_00]: Raphael's Food Pantry.

543
00:48:37,861 --> 00:48:43,364
[SPEAKER_00]: During the month of December, our students decorated ornaments and made cards for Medford senior citizens.

544
00:48:44,025 --> 00:48:50,368
[SPEAKER_00]: The cards and ornaments were wrapped in wrapping paper and bows and delivered to the Courtyard Nursing Care Center.

545
00:48:53,370 --> 00:48:57,933
[SPEAKER_00]: Our theme days, these are just two examples of the theme days that the school has organized.

546
00:48:57,973 --> 00:49:01,815
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a sports day, pajama day, crazy mixed up day.

547
00:49:02,235 --> 00:49:06,438
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, they're just fun themes that the students organized for the kids.

548
00:49:10,586 --> 00:49:16,929
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to highlight the work of Kathleen Keehan and her staff for running the Roberts School Afterschool Program.

549
00:49:17,669 --> 00:49:22,632
[SPEAKER_00]: In December, students in our afterschool program had the opportunity to work with Ms.

550
00:49:22,652 --> 00:49:24,733
[SPEAKER_00]: Susan Altman on a mosaic project.

551
00:49:25,593 --> 00:49:28,155
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the materials the students used were recycled.

552
00:49:29,095 --> 00:49:39,280
[SPEAKER_00]: Each student planned how they wanted their mosaic to look before completing their final design, and the students' creations will be added to a quilt made entirely of recycled materials.

553
00:49:40,827 --> 00:49:42,008
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful project.

554
00:49:43,028 --> 00:49:47,672
[SPEAKER_00]: I attended the day that they made these and they're like, Mrs. Pearl, what do you see here?

555
00:49:48,373 --> 00:49:55,759
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had their little mosaics and like, it's a river with trees and a sun and they put so much work into these mosaics.

556
00:49:55,819 --> 00:49:57,360
[SPEAKER_00]: They came out fantastic.

557
00:49:57,420 --> 00:50:01,063
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really wanted to highlight the work that they're doing in our afterschool program.

558
00:50:03,277 --> 00:50:13,342
[SPEAKER_00]: I also wanted to highlight math and science and action at the Roberts School and the incredible work of the teachers who are implementing project-based learning into their classrooms.

559
00:50:14,642 --> 00:50:38,972
[SPEAKER_00]: To finish up the what is all around us unit grade one students sent parachutes flying down the main lobby of the Robert school that's in our blue box, they stood up on the second floor, they designed the prototype for their parachute they dropped them the kiddos that are sitting on the floor practice observational skills they wrote what they saw how the prototype worked.

560
00:50:39,758 --> 00:50:47,044
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic, super, lots of excitement this day as students were dropping their parachutes down one floor.

561
00:50:48,705 --> 00:50:51,747
[SPEAKER_00]: In my green box, I have grade four measurement and data.

562
00:50:52,408 --> 00:50:55,610
[SPEAKER_00]: Grade four students have been generating and describing measurement data.

563
00:50:56,901 --> 00:51:00,342
[SPEAKER_00]: groups of students work together to create their own data projects.

564
00:51:01,322 --> 00:51:06,884
[SPEAKER_00]: They collected measurement data, they determined what materials they would need and conducted their own investigations.

565
00:51:07,604 --> 00:51:14,106
[SPEAKER_00]: They then turned all of their information into posters in which they presented to their classmates.

566
00:51:15,151 --> 00:51:19,253
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, in my pink box, this was my grade two tower building challenge.

567
00:51:19,833 --> 00:51:25,676
[SPEAKER_00]: Second grade students, they put their knowledge of properties of different solids to the test by constructing towers.

568
00:51:26,396 --> 00:51:33,540
[SPEAKER_00]: The challenge was to build a tower that stood at least 45 centimeters tall and was stable enough to sustain wind.

569
00:51:38,510 --> 00:51:47,320
[SPEAKER_00]: The third, fourth, and fifth grade at the Roberts had an out-of-this-world experience, thanks to the PTO, who sponsored Sky Dome Planetarium.

570
00:51:48,081 --> 00:51:50,724
[SPEAKER_00]: They visited the Roberts School on December 20th.

571
00:51:51,424 --> 00:51:58,572
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the photos here, they brought this gigantic silver dome in which the students entered through a tunnel.

572
00:52:00,287 --> 00:52:07,290
[SPEAKER_00]: They experienced a star-filled sky, so they sat around in the center of the dome.

573
00:52:08,150 --> 00:52:09,190
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a projector.

574
00:52:09,530 --> 00:52:13,172
[SPEAKER_00]: The presenter taught the kids about the stars, the planets.

575
00:52:14,052 --> 00:52:16,393
[SPEAKER_00]: There were rocket ships that launched.

576
00:52:17,493 --> 00:52:19,474
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing experience.

577
00:52:19,534 --> 00:52:27,057
[SPEAKER_00]: The kids loved it, the staff loved it, and really kind of brought some hands-on learning and some practical

578
00:52:28,856 --> 00:52:30,590
[SPEAKER_00]: science work right into our gymnasium.

579
00:52:34,132 --> 00:52:43,940
[SPEAKER_00]: I quickly want to give a shout out to Miss Kelly Malloy and Jimmy Giddings, who have been approved for Medford Education Foundation grants.

580
00:52:44,901 --> 00:52:55,409
[SPEAKER_00]: Miss Kelly Malloy received a $1,500 grant to buy Botley coding robots and Dash coding robots to be utilized during our technology time.

581
00:52:56,170 --> 00:53:01,254
[SPEAKER_00]: And this will be to teach students coding within that block of time for students in grades K through five.

582
00:53:02,438 --> 00:53:07,082
[SPEAKER_00]: The Botley robots are like hands-on robots where they can press buttons on the device.

583
00:53:07,162 --> 00:53:10,605
[SPEAKER_00]: The Botley robot is the one that has three circles.

584
00:53:12,086 --> 00:53:16,090
[SPEAKER_00]: You press the buttons and then you can code where you want this robot to go.

585
00:53:19,433 --> 00:53:22,195
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other, the Dash robots are more on a platform.

586
00:53:22,215 --> 00:53:26,639
[SPEAKER_00]: So they go onto a computer program and they learn how to code through an online platform.

587
00:53:27,426 --> 00:53:37,335
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Jimmy Giddings is a kindergarten teacher at the Roberts School, and he received a grant of 250 to purchase furniture and materials for a calming corner for our kindergarten students.

588
00:53:38,015 --> 00:53:49,786
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just gonna be a spot where students, when they're just feeling like they just need a minute to kind of sit and step away and just take a deep breath, putting together this little calming corner within the classroom.

589
00:53:50,166 --> 00:53:54,490
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to congratulate Kelly and Jimmy for their hard work in writing these grants.

590
00:53:57,606 --> 00:54:02,671
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I wanted to just talk about my walking school bus in October.

591
00:54:03,192 --> 00:54:14,362
[SPEAKER_00]: This was on each Wednesday in the month of October the Robert school participated in walking Wednesday, each of the Wednesdays had a fun theme to encourage students to walk or bike to school.

592
00:54:15,183 --> 00:54:18,704
[SPEAKER_00]: On October 4th, this was kind of the kickoff event.

593
00:54:18,904 --> 00:54:22,085
[SPEAKER_00]: It was Neon and Rainbow Day, which was one of my favorites.

594
00:54:22,165 --> 00:54:27,547
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, those are my socks that you see there with the turquoise shoes and the pink tutu.

595
00:54:27,587 --> 00:54:28,267
[SPEAKER_00]: That was me.

596
00:54:28,287 --> 00:54:31,008
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a fantastic event.

597
00:54:31,048 --> 00:54:32,389
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a great turnout.

598
00:54:33,469 --> 00:54:38,711
[SPEAKER_00]: Other themes were wear your Robert school gear, your Mustang blue or white.

599
00:54:39,291 --> 00:54:43,953
[SPEAKER_00]: Class Day, where students with the most participation won the Golden Sneaker Award.

600
00:54:44,894 --> 00:54:46,137
[SPEAKER_00]: and Wacky Hat Day.

601
00:54:46,157 --> 00:54:52,494
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to thank Sarah Reinfeld who worked so hard to make Walking School Bus such a success at the Roberts.

602
00:54:55,275 --> 00:54:59,558
[SPEAKER_00]: The Roberts Elementary girls on the run team had another great season.

603
00:54:59,878 --> 00:55:04,300
[SPEAKER_00]: Approximately 50 girls participate during the fall and spring season.

604
00:55:05,221 --> 00:55:12,965
[SPEAKER_00]: They joined 70 teams in 1600 girls from the greater Boston area in a 5K at Suffolk Downs.

605
00:55:13,426 --> 00:55:18,829
[SPEAKER_00]: The girls had so much fun and made lifelong friends with their teammates and classmates.

606
00:55:19,329 --> 00:55:20,890
[SPEAKER_00]: Such a fantastic.

607
00:55:21,930 --> 00:55:23,011
[SPEAKER_00]: Such a fantastic program.

608
00:55:23,945 --> 00:55:27,726
[SPEAKER_13]: Is it too early to tell you that I'm doing a boys on the right track team for the spring?

609
00:55:28,306 --> 00:55:29,687
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, fantastic.

610
00:55:29,727 --> 00:55:35,628
[SPEAKER_00]: So that will be in my next update.

611
00:55:36,168 --> 00:55:36,809
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.

612
00:55:37,229 --> 00:55:45,271
[SPEAKER_00]: And just lastly, and I wanted to put this on because I know there was lots of excitement about our new playground equipment.

613
00:55:46,291 --> 00:55:55,317
[SPEAKER_00]: So we finally have our new playground equipment, our bouncy bridge, our cargo net and canyon bridge are repaired, along with our kindergarten spinners on the structure.

614
00:55:56,157 --> 00:56:04,862
[SPEAKER_00]: The students were so excited when they saw the repair workers come with all of their materials.

615
00:56:05,342 --> 00:56:05,903
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like,

616
00:56:07,222 --> 00:56:08,363
[SPEAKER_00]: The kids were super excited.

617
00:56:08,603 --> 00:56:10,304
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my gosh, what's going on?

618
00:56:11,484 --> 00:56:13,505
[SPEAKER_00]: They're utilized every single day.

619
00:56:13,825 --> 00:56:21,689
[SPEAKER_00]: The kids love it and I just wanted to give a shout out and a thank you to the Medford Community Preservation Commission for making sure that this project gets completed.

620
00:56:23,230 --> 00:56:24,151
[SPEAKER_13]: Wonderful, thank you.

621
00:56:24,251 --> 00:56:24,831
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

622
00:56:25,592 --> 00:56:26,292
[SPEAKER_13]: Member McLaughlin.

623
00:56:27,513 --> 00:56:27,873
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

624
00:56:27,913 --> 00:56:28,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Principal Kroll.

625
00:56:28,853 --> 00:56:32,755
[SPEAKER_04]: That was really helpful and the Roberts is such a great school.

626
00:56:32,815 --> 00:56:35,777
[SPEAKER_04]: It's awesome to hear all the things the students are doing and makes me

627
00:56:36,696 --> 00:56:40,358
[SPEAKER_04]: back to elementary school, or go back into education.

628
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:44,581
[SPEAKER_04]: I just had a couple of questions in mind.

629
00:56:44,801 --> 00:56:47,663
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just actually trying to look on my phone and it wasn't coming up easily enough.

630
00:56:47,683 --> 00:56:56,009
[SPEAKER_04]: So I figured I could ask you, can you share, especially, you know, not just with us, but the community that's watching and others, what the demographics are for your school?

631
00:56:56,508 --> 00:57:05,615
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, so we currently have about 571 students, this was based on my October one sims I think right now i'm at like 575 ish.

632
00:57:05,635 --> 00:57:10,418
[SPEAKER_00]: I have about 8.9% on el students, which I think roughly is about 5050 students.

633
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:20,201
[SPEAKER_00]: Students with disabilities and at 19.4%.

634
00:57:21,702 --> 00:57:24,703
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that brings me to about 110.

635
00:57:24,883 --> 00:57:26,224
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this was from October.

636
00:57:26,284 --> 00:57:28,285
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm definitely a little bit higher than that right now.

637
00:57:29,525 --> 00:57:31,766
[SPEAKER_00]: We do house the Connections Program.

638
00:57:32,907 --> 00:57:34,528
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you tell us what the Connections Program is?

639
00:57:34,568 --> 00:57:40,511
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the Connections Program is the district-wide program for students with autism.

640
00:57:41,311 --> 00:57:47,334
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a program for kindergarten through grade five, and we currently have 28 students in our program.

641
00:57:48,466 --> 00:57:53,029
[SPEAKER_00]: with two or three that may be entering shortly.

642
00:57:53,829 --> 00:58:01,173
[SPEAKER_04]: And the 28 students over the K through five, just, can you explain how that can work in terms of, you know, students are grouped together?

643
00:58:01,473 --> 00:58:15,301
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, so right now, due to numbers, my kindergarten and grade one students are grouped together, and then I have a full grade two group, because they're the largest group, and then my third, fourth, and fifth graders are grouped together.

644
00:58:16,203 --> 00:58:16,603
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

645
00:58:16,783 --> 00:58:18,424
[SPEAKER_04]: You're welcome.

646
00:58:18,524 --> 00:58:21,786
[SPEAKER_04]: And then for the 8.9% EL, is that a newcomer program?

647
00:58:21,866 --> 00:58:23,247
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not a newcomer program.

648
00:58:23,587 --> 00:58:28,870
[SPEAKER_00]: So after they leave the newcomer program, they can come back to the Roberts and they receive the EL instruction.

649
00:58:28,910 --> 00:58:35,813
[SPEAKER_00]: I have two full-time EL teachers that support through a combination of pull-out services and push-in services.

650
00:58:36,113 --> 00:58:36,734
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, thank you.

651
00:58:36,794 --> 00:58:39,035
[SPEAKER_00]: And then economically disadvantaged?

652
00:58:39,475 --> 00:58:41,216
[SPEAKER_00]: Economically disadvantaged, 28.4%.

653
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:47,781
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

654
00:58:47,801 --> 00:58:48,961
[SPEAKER_04]: You're welcome.

655
00:58:49,181 --> 00:58:49,722
[SPEAKER_04]: May I, may I?

656
00:58:49,742 --> 00:58:50,502
[SPEAKER_04]: I just had a couple more.

657
00:58:51,142 --> 00:58:51,483
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

658
00:58:51,563 --> 00:59:07,392
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, so for the responsive classroom, which, you know, I know is a great program and I love the emphasis on inclusion and kindness, which I think are so needed in our world in so many ways today.

659
00:59:08,353 --> 00:59:10,014
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm wondering how that is,

660
00:59:11,257 --> 00:59:14,139
[SPEAKER_04]: differentiated for your 19.4% and your 8.9% so you're 110 and 50 160 students.

661
00:59:14,159 --> 00:59:15,500
[SPEAKER_04]: That are both neuro diverse and.

662
00:59:23,857 --> 00:59:24,578
[SPEAKER_04]: different languages.

663
00:59:24,738 --> 00:59:25,018
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

664
00:59:25,238 --> 00:59:28,320
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, many different ways.

665
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:33,964
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that some of the things that we are doing is not only are they getting this presentation.

666
00:59:34,024 --> 00:59:39,667
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're pulling, if we're doing a whole great assembly, there's also lots of work that are being done in the classroom.

667
00:59:39,727 --> 00:59:46,852
[SPEAKER_00]: So making it that it's really super great appropriate, um, really kind of pulling out these key vocabulary words for them.

668
00:59:46,912 --> 00:59:48,233
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we talk about kindness,

669
00:59:49,594 --> 00:59:50,897
[SPEAKER_00]: What does kindness actually look like?

670
00:59:50,957 --> 00:59:52,140
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does it actually look like?

671
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:54,204
[SPEAKER_00]: And what does kindness actually sound like?

672
00:59:54,545 --> 00:59:56,008
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's some of the work that we're doing.

673
00:59:56,028 --> 00:59:59,055
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we can say kindness, we need to be kind.

674
01:00:00,103 --> 01:00:01,765
[SPEAKER_00]: And for some kids are like, yep, I've heard that.

675
01:00:02,105 --> 01:00:04,307
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's all kinds of t-shirts that say, be kind.

676
01:00:04,347 --> 01:00:05,208
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're seeing that.

677
01:00:05,228 --> 01:00:06,950
[SPEAKER_00]: And they know like, that means that we have to be nice.

678
01:00:07,110 --> 01:00:09,152
[SPEAKER_00]: But how do we actually apply that?

679
01:00:09,192 --> 01:00:11,455
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're doing lots of, this is what it looks like.

680
01:00:12,216 --> 01:00:14,538
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what kindness actually sounds like.

681
01:00:15,519 --> 01:00:19,023
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're breaking that down for them in many different settings.

682
01:00:19,043 --> 01:00:22,086
[SPEAKER_00]: So have it be in a whole group setting, but then in also that small group setting.

683
01:00:22,486 --> 01:00:33,873
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of our kiddos are also, not only are they getting that whole group assembly, but for some kids, they're getting just pushed in for that morning meeting time with the classroom teachers.

684
01:00:34,013 --> 01:00:49,303
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's within that block, lots of differentiation that's going on just specifically regarding the responsive classroom and the core values and breaking it down into kid-friendly language through the responsive classroom curriculum.

685
01:00:49,943 --> 01:00:50,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

686
01:00:50,603 --> 01:00:52,265
[SPEAKER_04]: And recess and lunch are integrated?

687
01:00:52,285 --> 01:00:52,265
100%.

688
01:00:52,765 --> 01:00:53,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

689
01:00:54,306 --> 01:00:56,728
[SPEAKER_04]: And then two more questions.

690
01:00:56,828 --> 01:01:00,090
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you, what do you, it's awesome hearing all the wonderful things.

691
01:01:00,631 --> 01:01:01,852
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know this is your first year.

692
01:01:02,252 --> 01:01:02,913
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to MET.

693
01:01:03,253 --> 01:01:03,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

694
01:01:03,793 --> 01:01:05,074
[SPEAKER_04]: We're super excited to have you.

695
01:01:05,294 --> 01:01:09,057
[SPEAKER_04]: I've heard really great things from your colleagues from previous places.

696
01:01:09,157 --> 01:01:10,358
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm really excited that.

697
01:01:11,231 --> 01:01:16,252
[SPEAKER_04]: You're here, and I'm sure you've gotten thrown right into it, which is always the best way, right?

698
01:01:16,272 --> 01:01:16,913
[SPEAKER_04]: You learn right away.

699
01:01:18,493 --> 01:01:22,374
[SPEAKER_04]: So I loved that you were talking about the connection students being part of the student council.

700
01:01:22,614 --> 01:01:24,115
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to comment on that as well.

701
01:01:24,135 --> 01:01:27,416
[SPEAKER_04]: But what is it that you feel like you need?

702
01:01:27,976 --> 01:01:31,137
[SPEAKER_04]: We're hearing all the great things about our elementary schools, which we want to hear.

703
01:01:31,877 --> 01:01:34,798
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's also really important for us to understand what is it that you need?

704
01:01:34,838 --> 01:01:35,818
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you fully staffed?

705
01:01:35,878 --> 01:01:38,599
[SPEAKER_04]: Is your building operating well?

706
01:01:38,659 --> 01:01:39,759
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, sort of those things.

707
01:01:40,694 --> 01:01:42,115
[SPEAKER_04]: how we can help them, what it is you need.

708
01:01:42,495 --> 01:01:42,775
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

709
01:01:42,835 --> 01:01:57,766
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that for the first time, you know, as I have done kind of my talks with teachers and administrators and families, I do think for the first time our Connections program is fully staffed, which is huge.

710
01:01:57,886 --> 01:02:02,549
[SPEAKER_00]: So full staff for paraprofessionals and for teachers.

711
01:02:03,449 --> 01:02:05,211
[SPEAKER_00]: However, my enrollment has gone up.

712
01:02:06,331 --> 01:02:10,155
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am at, again, I want to say I'm at like 575 today.

713
01:02:10,216 --> 01:02:11,537
[SPEAKER_00]: So my enrollment has gone up.

714
01:02:11,677 --> 01:02:25,933
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are so many wonderful things going at the Roberts School, but I do think there are some pockets of some additional staff that I need so that I'm fully supporting students in an inclusive setting, specifically some inclusion type work.

715
01:02:28,123 --> 01:02:51,585
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that we have to look at numbers and have conversations about the numbers of students that we service at the Roberts and just making sure that there's just equity amongst the schools, just to make sure that, like, again, I'm growing, my school's growing, and we're getting more diverse students on many different levels, have it be English language learners, special education,

716
01:02:53,820 --> 01:02:56,403
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just, I want to make sure that we're addressing the needs of all of our kids.

717
01:02:56,443 --> 01:03:03,270
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do think that there's some conversations that we can have regarding staffing and making sure that we're appropriately staffed kind of moving forward.

718
01:03:05,172 --> 01:03:13,822
[SPEAKER_00]: Because with some more staff, obviously, I can do even more great things and just make sure that students are growing and that we're giving everything that they need and deserve.

719
01:03:14,525 --> 01:03:16,706
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, and I think that comes from leadership, right?

720
01:03:16,766 --> 01:03:18,207
[SPEAKER_04]: And I appreciate you saying that.

721
01:03:18,247 --> 01:03:23,689
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it's important that we continue the conversation because we need to hear the things both that are positive and the things that are needed.

722
01:03:24,069 --> 01:03:25,390
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you for sharing that.

723
01:03:25,470 --> 01:03:30,852
[SPEAKER_04]: And then lastly, and I thank you to my colleagues and to the mayor for indulging me here.

724
01:03:30,912 --> 01:03:32,913
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is a really, really last one, I promise.

725
01:03:33,913 --> 01:03:37,815
[SPEAKER_04]: How can the school committee be involved in your school?

726
01:03:37,855 --> 01:03:41,817
[SPEAKER_04]: In other words, are there opportunities for some of the events that you had, for example,

727
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:49,322
[SPEAKER_04]: that school committee members can come to, or reading in any of the classrooms, and all of the classrooms, and all of the programming.

728
01:03:49,783 --> 01:03:53,225
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to invite any of you to come down to the Roberts.

729
01:03:53,285 --> 01:04:05,432
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's important when we're talking about our special programming, I can stand here and talk about the Connections program, and I can talk about our EL program, and our inclusion program, but for you to see it in action,

730
01:04:07,389 --> 01:04:12,350
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that just puts a whole other lens on, huh, now I know what she's talking about, right?

731
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:26,753
[SPEAKER_00]: So I welcome if you pop in, send me an email to come down and take a walk and see the things that we are doing and the needs that we have so that you can live it and see it.

732
01:04:26,773 --> 01:04:30,573
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I do think that that's the way in which, I mean, I would love for any of you to come down.

733
01:04:30,633 --> 01:04:32,234
[SPEAKER_00]: You can read to any of our kids.

734
01:04:32,574 --> 01:04:32,994
[SPEAKER_00]: They love it.

735
01:04:33,744 --> 01:04:37,147
[SPEAKER_00]: You can attend any of our assemblies, I can let you know when those are.

736
01:04:37,948 --> 01:04:46,236
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think just coming down and living it and seeing it, I think will just give a perspective of setting priorities when we're talking about budget.

737
01:04:47,717 --> 01:04:48,178
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome.

738
01:04:48,518 --> 01:04:49,099
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you so much.

739
01:04:49,139 --> 01:04:49,439
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

740
01:04:49,459 --> 01:04:51,781
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome.

741
01:04:51,961 --> 01:04:52,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

807
01:07:35,337 --> 01:07:35,917
[SPEAKER_07]: Good evening.

808
01:07:36,677 --> 01:07:45,960
[SPEAKER_07]: So this evening, in your packets you should have received on over the weekend, you have highlighted sections in orange.

809
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:51,602
[SPEAKER_07]: So I did first present my goals back in October to the committee.

810
01:07:52,642 --> 01:07:59,986
[SPEAKER_07]: And when I originally presented my goals, the committee gave feedback at that time.

811
01:08:00,607 --> 01:08:08,731
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything that is listed in orange is either a revision or redaction or an addition.

812
01:08:09,772 --> 01:08:12,233
[SPEAKER_07]: So under the district improvement goal,

813
01:08:15,569 --> 01:08:30,692
[SPEAKER_07]: During the school year 23-24, the Medford Public Schools will improve the systems and structures that directly impact student services, student and family and communications, and school facilities and operations.

814
01:08:31,833 --> 01:08:55,085
[SPEAKER_07]: And so the goals listed are in the left hand column, and under key actions, I'm only going to speak specifically to the changes that were made under key action number one, we eliminated the word physical and just said improve accessibility at school facilities and develop a maintenance ticket system.

815
01:08:56,465 --> 01:09:06,988
[SPEAKER_07]: Under number four, reestablish the capital planning committee to examine building systems and create a replacement timeline for individual systems.

816
01:09:10,849 --> 01:09:22,633
[SPEAKER_07]: Bullet number six, enhance human resource practices, such as job posting, hiring and payroll management, and to also be inclusive of labor relations.

817
01:09:24,623 --> 01:09:34,901
[SPEAKER_07]: Bullet number seven, preparing and presenting to the committee a timely budget process for FY25.

818
01:09:37,096 --> 01:09:45,703
[SPEAKER_07]: Bullet number eight, or number eight excessive heat protocol for the Medford public schools to be presented to the committee.

819
01:09:46,684 --> 01:09:53,809
[SPEAKER_07]: Number nine, a revised middle school and high school schedule revised middle and high school schedules.

820
01:09:55,050 --> 01:10:00,874
[SPEAKER_07]: Number 10 evidence of full implementation of the new bullying policy.

821
01:10:01,694 --> 01:10:16,284
[SPEAKER_07]: Number 11 outcome of the high school climate study including measures of improvement in number 12, the strategic plan developed with the engagement of a wider audience of stakeholders.

822
01:10:17,948 --> 01:10:35,069
[SPEAKER_07]: Those were all of the additions that were recommended by the committee under key actions, and then outcomes to finalize the employee handbook, which is significantly underway under increased accessibility of parking.

823
01:10:36,030 --> 01:10:50,852
[SPEAKER_07]: pedestrian routes, restroom facilities, building signage and navigational aids, ASL or language interpretation, and closed captioning for video content.

824
01:10:51,412 --> 01:11:00,837
[SPEAKER_07]: So additional verbiage to be more explicit about what the outcomes could be for that bulleted outcome.

825
01:11:01,597 --> 01:11:20,107
[SPEAKER_07]: Under the communications platform, the feedback was to communications platforms such as some more and final site mass notifications are used regularly by all schools and to eliminate the language and student servicing groups because I think it just didn't belong there.

826
01:11:21,681 --> 01:11:36,334
[SPEAKER_07]: Under outcomes on the back of page two on the final bullet was to have increased two way communication with families with a minimum of five additional events for this school year.

827
01:11:37,575 --> 01:11:41,479
[SPEAKER_07]: Moving over to student learning, learning goal under literacy.

828
01:11:43,618 --> 01:11:57,326
[SPEAKER_07]: The goal was to remain intact, but the committee requested that when the data is presented at the end of the year, that the data be disaggregated to show at each school under accountability.

829
01:11:57,766 --> 01:12:09,513
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that language was added at each school for NWEA MAP and at each school for DIBELS, showing the growth from September of 2023 through June of 2024.

830
01:12:15,058 --> 01:12:19,943
[SPEAKER_07]: And my professional practice goal was approved by the committee.

831
01:12:20,724 --> 01:12:37,461
[SPEAKER_07]: So I apologize for the delay in not being able to present these goals before December, but I wanted just to let the committee see this, everything that's highlighted in orange.

832
01:12:38,702 --> 01:12:42,886
[SPEAKER_07]: was the specific feedback that the committee provided at that time.

833
01:12:43,546 --> 01:12:51,793
[SPEAKER_07]: And we carefully replayed the video and the audio to make sure that we captured all of the additions.

834
01:12:52,413 --> 01:13:02,181
[SPEAKER_07]: And so my request to the committee is it's recommendation to approve so that I can actually start executing this work.

835
01:13:02,821 --> 01:13:03,202
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

836
01:13:03,222 --> 01:13:04,943
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Dr. Edward-Vincent.

837
01:13:05,483 --> 01:13:06,204
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Graham.

838
01:13:06,965 --> 01:13:07,305
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

839
01:13:09,136 --> 01:13:09,636
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for this.

840
01:13:09,696 --> 01:13:15,721
[SPEAKER_11]: I had one question and perhaps one amendment if my colleagues are so inclined.

841
01:13:17,082 --> 01:13:26,328
[SPEAKER_11]: The first question I had on the first page under number four, reestablish the capital planning committee to examine building systems and create replacement timeline for individual systems.

842
01:13:27,289 --> 01:13:29,010
[SPEAKER_11]: Who do you envision is on this committee?

843
01:13:34,554 --> 01:13:36,255
[SPEAKER_07]: We would definitely need to have

844
01:13:39,406 --> 01:13:45,490
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I it and from city building and grounds, working with.

845
01:13:45,991 --> 01:14:06,906
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe you could ask for Paul, Ricky or someone from the city team to support us and as many members as possible, who would like to be part of the capital planning, and the feedback last time was to make sure that it was about the individual systems.

846
01:14:08,567 --> 01:14:10,288
[SPEAKER_07]: based on the video.

847
01:14:13,370 --> 01:14:21,195
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm I am open to having other other stakeholders be involved, just, you know, for certain meetings.

848
01:14:22,896 --> 01:14:31,242
[SPEAKER_07]: If it gets too too large, then it's it's it's hard to manage and it's hard to accomplish as much as you would like to accomplish.

849
01:14:31,684 --> 01:14:32,365
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure.

850
01:14:32,545 --> 01:14:42,173
[SPEAKER_11]: My, my major request is that this committee participate in that process actively versus sort of get something when you all think you're done.

851
01:14:42,293 --> 01:14:55,605
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think we just need to think about that, especially with the subcommittee structure, like just figure out like the right way to do that and make sure that the committee can be apprised of like the consideration and the work that's being done because all of those things.

852
01:14:56,496 --> 01:15:01,901
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, add up to either surprises where we're having to say to the mayor, like, hey, we don't have money for this.

853
01:15:02,041 --> 01:15:06,164
[SPEAKER_11]: And does the city have money or we have to find money in our budget.

854
01:15:06,204 --> 01:15:07,886
[SPEAKER_11]: And so all of that sort of

855
01:15:08,810 --> 01:15:26,746
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would like this committee to have some way to know, like, when the meetings are like what what the meetings are happening about what the content is and then some way for us some portion of us to participate, whether that's like the building and grounds committee or the strategic planning committee like there's places where.

856
01:15:27,247 --> 01:15:30,049
[SPEAKER_11]: those updates could happen in subcommittee, which I think is totally fine.

857
01:15:30,069 --> 01:15:34,613
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to make sure that we're on the same page that we need to participate in that.

858
01:15:35,013 --> 01:15:49,045
[SPEAKER_07]: I was actually going to suggest as you were asking about that, which subcommittee could it possibly be folded into or kind of repurpose one of the subcommittee

859
01:15:49,785 --> 01:15:58,889
[SPEAKER_07]: or ask two members of a particular subcommittee to be sitting members or permanent members.

860
01:15:58,909 --> 01:16:10,654
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we can like work all of that out once the subcommittees are established and defined and all of that I just wanted to make sure that was on your radar that we should be participating in that process.

861
01:16:11,735 --> 01:16:12,775
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, definitely.

862
01:16:13,636 --> 01:16:18,898
[SPEAKER_11]: And then my possible amendment is on page two.

863
01:16:19,941 --> 01:16:33,725
[SPEAKER_11]: number 12 around the strategic plan and I think what you added to that was developed with the with a engagement of a wider audience of stakeholders which when we do strategic plan that's absolutely how we should do it.

864
01:16:34,525 --> 01:16:42,107
[SPEAKER_11]: I am questioning whether that is reasonable to accomplish this year and I say that really specifically with

865
01:16:43,928 --> 01:16:56,619
[SPEAKER_11]: In mind, some of the strategic work that the administration is going to have to do in preparation for MSBA so I think I'm concerned that there's just no way that you that the administration can do both of those things well.

866
01:16:58,520 --> 01:17:00,282
[SPEAKER_11]: Between now and the end of the year so.

867
01:17:01,104 --> 01:17:05,866
[SPEAKER_11]: when I think about the strategic work that has to happen on the MSBA side, right?

868
01:17:05,906 --> 01:17:19,892
[SPEAKER_11]: Like there's, it's sort of a wide ranging set of activities, including like counting classrooms, but also talking about like, what's the educational plan we're trying to provide, collecting up past enrollment and looking at future enrollment.

869
01:17:20,052 --> 01:17:30,656
[SPEAKER_11]: And because we have a vocational school, there's a whole complexity around the vocational school and the programming that we offer and what we want, what the capacity is right now and what we want the capacity to be.

870
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:36,925
[SPEAKER_11]: And then new programs we might want to sort of provide for in addition to a whole maintenance plan.

871
01:17:36,985 --> 01:17:39,207
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's so much strategic work there.

872
01:17:39,267 --> 01:17:45,071
[SPEAKER_11]: I know there's like a scheduling thing going on right now as well in terms of updating the high school schedule and the middle school schedules.

873
01:17:45,712 --> 01:17:50,095
[SPEAKER_11]: All of that has to get done in order for us to meet the requirements of our eligibility phase.

874
01:17:50,696 --> 01:18:00,244
[SPEAKER_11]: And if with all of that work that has to get done, I just don't see how you also can have a meaningful community engagement process around the strategic plan.

875
01:18:01,007 --> 01:18:10,651
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would like to make a motion to approve this with the amendment that we strike number 12 completely, because I just don't think it's reasonable for you to accomplish that right now.

876
01:18:12,932 --> 01:18:13,732
[SPEAKER_07]: I support that.

877
01:18:15,913 --> 01:18:16,973
[SPEAKER_07]: That recommendation.

878
01:18:18,354 --> 01:18:26,057
[SPEAKER_13]: So motion on the floor for approval as amended, proposing to strike number 12.

879
01:18:26,157 --> 01:18:27,938
[SPEAKER_13]: Member McLaughlin.

880
01:18:27,998 --> 01:18:28,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

881
01:18:29,460 --> 01:18:38,343
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate the concern with too many things to do, especially with the MSBA and the work that is trying to be done there.

882
01:18:38,403 --> 01:18:50,387
[SPEAKER_04]: At the same time, if there's work being done on the strategic plan, I still would wanna be thinking about how a wider range of stakeholders are being engaged with that.

883
01:18:50,427 --> 01:18:55,089
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, maybe it's the Family Engagement Subcommittee or something, but maybe it's not necessarily

884
01:18:56,334 --> 01:19:05,940
[SPEAKER_04]: Superintendent has to specifically plan something, but maybe it's a subcommittee could do something and not as vast as maybe is what the expectation is here.

885
01:19:05,980 --> 01:19:09,942
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm assuming that it's actually not clarified on the right how that would actually be done.

886
01:19:10,602 --> 01:19:17,926
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm curious about what that would actually look like developed with the engagement of a wider audience of stakeholders.

887
01:19:17,987 --> 01:19:21,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Like how do you actually break that down into action items?

888
01:19:22,751 --> 01:19:36,479
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I hear you in one sense that yes, there's a lot of work to be done, but in another sense, I don't wanna sacrifice family engagement and community engagement at all.

889
01:19:36,559 --> 01:19:41,602
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm wondering if there's some kind of a happy medium or something in between.

890
01:19:42,703 --> 01:19:54,775
[SPEAKER_07]: If I may, through the chair, at the time when I presented in October, we hadn't yet received the wonderful news of December that we were actually approved this time for the MSBA.

891
01:19:55,235 --> 01:20:01,961
[SPEAKER_07]: When I originally presented my goals, I had six key actions.

892
01:20:02,842 --> 01:20:05,963
[SPEAKER_07]: and the six key actions jumped doubled from six to 12.

893
01:20:06,924 --> 01:20:15,287
[SPEAKER_07]: And member Ruseau kind of shared at that time with the committee that there were so many hours in a day.

894
01:20:15,867 --> 01:20:26,591
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm not afraid to list if there were 25 things that are listed by the time June rolls around, it's either I can make all 25 or you do or you don't.

895
01:20:26,651 --> 01:20:28,752
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're gonna try to do it.

896
01:20:29,572 --> 01:20:31,773
[SPEAKER_07]: In terms of the strategic plan, I have been working

897
01:20:33,014 --> 01:20:38,318
[SPEAKER_07]: with administrators, we have started new programs, curriculum programs.

898
01:20:38,338 --> 01:20:55,011
[SPEAKER_07]: So there is work that is happening, but the fact that we have now been approved to participate in MSBA, there is a lot of work that we're gonna have to do for that.

899
01:20:55,491 --> 01:20:55,811
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's,

900
01:20:57,092 --> 01:21:11,664
[SPEAKER_07]: strategic plan it's not that it's going away that is still our kind of guidebook our blue book that we're referring to, but at the same time, it would make sense to defer it.

901
01:21:12,724 --> 01:21:20,671
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, you know, I can focus on the 11 and then for the beginning of next year which we, you know, will be in that MSBA.

902
01:21:21,671 --> 01:21:22,871
[SPEAKER_07]: phase one process.

903
01:21:23,331 --> 01:21:27,532
[SPEAKER_07]: So all of this work will end up being done like almost again.

904
01:21:27,652 --> 01:21:37,714
[SPEAKER_07]: So we could do something and then what ends up happening as a result of the MSBA is like, throw all of that out and let's start over with something new.

905
01:21:39,054 --> 01:21:42,915
[SPEAKER_13]: So I... Member McLaughlin, then Member Graham.

906
01:21:43,595 --> 01:21:44,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, thank you.

907
01:21:44,355 --> 01:21:46,676
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, in response to that, I appreciate that.

908
01:21:46,796 --> 01:21:48,916
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess what I'm feeling is that

909
01:21:49,662 --> 01:22:15,389
[SPEAKER_04]: it's about integrating some of this work with, not just specifically the strategic plan, which I know that this is the line item in particular we're talking about in terms of engaging stakeholders, but I even am wondering like, and I know there was a great flow chart in here about the MSBA process, and I think that's really great, and I know that there was outreach and communication in the letter, and I'm thinking about how we're actively engaging people and even what is the MSBA process, right?

910
01:22:15,429 --> 01:22:16,369
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think it's, again,

911
01:22:17,193 --> 01:22:24,263
[SPEAKER_04]: family and community engagement and thinking about how it's integrated in all of these things, not necessarily about in this one strategic plan and reaching out to stakeholders.

912
01:22:24,303 --> 01:22:30,732
[SPEAKER_04]: And so crossing that off the list, I think can give the interpretation or the impression that we're not engaging stakeholders.

913
01:22:30,932 --> 01:22:32,655
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't want that obviously to be the case.

914
01:22:33,166 --> 01:22:51,434
[SPEAKER_07]: But under outcomes, we did add five additional family community engagement events that will be, those could be about budget, like creating additional opportunities for the community to have that two-way communication.

915
01:22:51,934 --> 01:23:00,318
[SPEAKER_07]: So I do think that there will be additional opportunities for greater community engagement.

916
01:23:00,697 --> 01:23:12,788
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think we have the plan of a new high school which will bring about much community engagement from the committee to the open the public meetings will be having for input throughout the course of the next two years.

917
01:23:12,808 --> 01:23:14,010
[SPEAKER_13]: Remember, Graham.

918
01:23:14,910 --> 01:23:22,838
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I just wanted to offer maybe another suggestion to one thing that family and community engagement subcommittee could do this year is

919
01:23:24,730 --> 01:23:32,676
[SPEAKER_11]: sort of articulate and map out what a strategic planning process that includes meaningful community engagement looks like for next year.

920
01:23:33,177 --> 01:23:52,431
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I think in my mind, I would just like everyone to just keep working at the strategic plan that exists right now, hit pause on the idea of creating something new for just a couple months so that we can get this MSBA process off to a good solid start.

921
01:23:52,952 --> 01:23:53,892
[SPEAKER_11]: And in that time,

922
01:23:55,094 --> 01:24:10,827
[SPEAKER_11]: subcommittee could meet and say what would it look like for the community and families to be meaningfully engaged in a strategic planning process and outline that so that at the beginning of next year when we say okay we're ready for the strategic plan we can say and this is what

923
01:24:11,348 --> 01:24:15,289
[SPEAKER_11]: we sort of think and recommend that this looks like from an engagement perspective.

924
01:24:15,329 --> 01:24:27,833
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think something like that probably could be accomplished in like a meeting or two, and also provide sort of good preparation for when the administration's gonna turn their attention to that next year.

925
01:24:28,673 --> 01:24:38,235
[SPEAKER_11]: So that is sort of what I'm thinking, because I agree, I don't think we wanna say, we're not trying to say that we don't want community engagement, that's not it at all.

926
01:24:38,656 --> 01:24:40,236
[SPEAKER_11]: I think what we are saying though is,

927
01:24:40,572 --> 01:24:46,913
[SPEAKER_11]: There are only 24 hours in the day and strategic planning is really hard, earnest work, and there's just not time to do it well.

928
01:24:47,033 --> 01:24:55,875
[SPEAKER_11]: And I would rather us just push it off a little bit if it means we have an opportunity to do it well then, rather than do it now.

929
01:24:57,835 --> 01:24:58,736
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's reasonable.

930
01:24:59,116 --> 01:25:06,157
[SPEAKER_04]: And as long as we're talking about the subcommittee and family engagement and making sure that we're being strategic about that, then that would be okay.

931
01:25:09,766 --> 01:25:11,987
[SPEAKER_13]: Second.

932
01:25:12,707 --> 01:25:18,249
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion for approval as amended by Member Graham, seconded by Member Ruseau.

933
01:25:19,790 --> 01:25:20,610
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

934
01:25:20,910 --> 01:25:21,570
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

935
01:25:21,831 --> 01:25:24,332
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

936
01:25:24,732 --> 01:25:26,912
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion for approval passes as amended.

937
01:25:28,293 --> 01:25:28,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

938
01:25:29,733 --> 01:25:34,855
[SPEAKER_13]: And last under updates is a recommendation to approve the school year 24-25 school calendar

939
01:25:37,093 --> 01:25:41,879
[SPEAKER_13]: presented by Dr. Peter Cushing, Assistant Superintendent of Enrichment, Innovation, and Operations.

940
01:25:42,740 --> 01:25:42,960
[SPEAKER_12]: Welcome.

941
01:25:48,422 --> 01:25:50,883
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening, Madam Mayor, members of the school committee, thank you very much.

942
01:25:51,223 --> 01:25:54,285
[SPEAKER_01]: This year, we're presenting three options for the committee to consider.

943
01:25:55,165 --> 01:26:05,610
[SPEAKER_01]: The first is really focusing on the committee's wishes to honor the religious holidays through the Jewish, Islamic, and Christian faiths.

944
01:26:05,630 --> 01:26:12,533
[SPEAKER_01]: The last day of school, I'm sorry, the first day of school for all calendars is Tuesday, August 27th, 2024.

945
01:26:12,593 --> 01:26:16,075
[SPEAKER_01]: For the last several years, we have begun on a Wednesday.

946
01:26:17,336 --> 01:26:22,641
[SPEAKER_01]: The last day of school on this with no snow days would be Tuesday, June 17th.

947
01:26:23,622 --> 01:26:33,052
[SPEAKER_01]: The second option we're presenting is no religious holidays observed in the Christian, Islamic or Jewish faith structures.

948
01:26:34,193 --> 01:26:37,957
[SPEAKER_01]: We recognize and affirm all of our students and families

949
01:26:38,437 --> 01:26:57,471
[SPEAKER_01]: religious beliefs, but provide them the opportunity to take religious observance days as necessary and to really work to ensure that there is no work assigned as is actually under state law, not just school committee policy, but also state law.

950
01:26:57,611 --> 01:27:02,334
[SPEAKER_01]: So the last day of school for this would be Thursday, June 12th.

951
01:27:03,515 --> 01:27:07,238
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we also considered an earliest possible release.

952
01:27:08,171 --> 01:27:16,834
[SPEAKER_01]: which would get us out on Wednesday, June 11th, but that would mean that the half day before Christmas vacation would be Monday, December 23rd.

953
01:27:16,854 --> 01:27:28,718
[SPEAKER_01]: I also wanna say that I realized that that half day would probably have exceptionally low attendance in all categories of constituents of the Medford Public Schools, and I will leave it at that.

954
01:27:29,999 --> 01:27:30,199
[SPEAKER_13]: Mayor.

955
01:27:31,499 --> 01:27:32,640
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

956
01:27:33,540 --> 01:27:34,180
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Ruseau.

957
01:27:34,780 --> 01:27:35,521
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

958
01:27:37,054 --> 01:27:59,792
[SPEAKER_09]: we, it's not our wishes, it's our policy, which we approved two years, December of 2020 is when we approved this policy and it went through our standard processes and was deliberated and there was plenty of input from the community as well as the committee at the time and the administration had plenty of opportunity to speak at our meetings.

959
01:28:01,533 --> 01:28:06,657
[SPEAKER_09]: I won't pretend that it's not an uncomfortable conversation to have to suggest that we're gonna

960
01:28:07,011 --> 01:28:09,113
[SPEAKER_09]: honor some religious holidays and not others.

961
01:28:10,214 --> 01:28:16,039
[SPEAKER_09]: So while it was an open meeting, I do acknowledge that it's a difficult conversation.

962
01:28:17,080 --> 01:28:23,105
[SPEAKER_09]: I will say that I disliked the use of your preferred calendar.

963
01:28:23,626 --> 01:28:24,907
[SPEAKER_09]: The committee has a policy.

964
01:28:25,007 --> 01:28:27,970
[SPEAKER_09]: So frankly, the administration's preference is not a real thing.

965
01:28:28,550 --> 01:28:29,991
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the committee's policy.

966
01:28:30,091 --> 01:28:33,474
[SPEAKER_09]: So I was a little taken aback by,

967
01:28:34,332 --> 01:28:38,613
[SPEAKER_09]: the administration having a preference to not abide by the policy of this body.

968
01:28:39,893 --> 01:28:47,995
[SPEAKER_09]: But that aside, I'd motion to approve calendar A, which abides by our policy.

969
01:28:48,635 --> 01:28:51,376
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the calendar I would motion to approve.

970
01:28:51,716 --> 01:28:59,458
[SPEAKER_09]: And the second motion I have is to send calendar options B and C to a committee of the whole, so this whole

971
01:29:01,079 --> 01:29:12,710
[SPEAKER_09]: This whole committee can sit down and, and discuss what are our goals around calendars and observations and there's clearly some people want to get out of school as soon as possible.

972
01:29:13,290 --> 01:29:19,757
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that if that is the goal we should be talking about more than just the religious holidays, frankly.

973
01:29:21,018 --> 01:29:24,221
[SPEAKER_09]: There's February vacation is an utterly ridiculous thing.

974
01:29:26,721 --> 01:29:28,403
[SPEAKER_09]: And my understanding is teachers hate it.

975
01:29:28,483 --> 01:29:34,649
[SPEAKER_09]: They finally figured out how to start teaching kids after Christmas break, winter break as we pretend to call it.

976
01:29:36,091 --> 01:29:37,992
[SPEAKER_09]: And then suddenly we're all gone again.

977
01:29:38,433 --> 01:29:44,239
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think it's worth another conversation to revisit this calendar policy.

978
01:29:44,319 --> 01:29:46,301
[SPEAKER_09]: So those are my two motions.

979
01:29:49,102 --> 01:29:51,222
[SPEAKER_13]: Just from the chair, if I could ask that they be separate.

980
01:29:51,283 --> 01:29:56,744
[SPEAKER_13]: I think I agree with which calendar you want to choose and why, and I think that's been fully vetted.

981
01:29:56,764 --> 01:30:00,824
[SPEAKER_13]: I second calendar A. Motion.

982
01:30:01,465 --> 01:30:03,685
[SPEAKER_13]: You'll second calendar A motion.

983
01:30:03,925 --> 01:30:08,546
[SPEAKER_13]: So motion by Member Ruseau to approve calendar A, seconded by Member McLaughlin.

984
01:30:09,106 --> 01:30:09,926
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

985
01:30:09,946 --> 01:30:10,907
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

986
01:30:11,607 --> 01:30:12,407
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

987
01:30:13,729 --> 01:30:15,170
[SPEAKER_13]: calendar A has been accepted.

988
01:30:15,190 --> 01:30:22,336
[SPEAKER_13]: Now members, so you wanna give a motion to potentially send this to committee to discuss?

989
01:30:22,396 --> 01:30:25,259
[SPEAKER_09]: Calendar B and C, the calendar policy.

990
01:30:25,279 --> 01:30:28,041
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so if I could ask for a roll call on that.

991
01:30:28,301 --> 01:30:30,363
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

992
01:30:31,043 --> 01:30:33,125
[SPEAKER_13]: Point of inquiry.

993
01:30:33,145 --> 01:30:36,348
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm getting, sorry.

994
01:30:40,781 --> 01:30:42,882
[SPEAKER_04]: the whole or to the policy subcommittee?

995
01:30:43,042 --> 01:30:44,283
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought you said Committee the whole, right?

996
01:30:44,343 --> 01:30:44,623
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

997
01:30:44,643 --> 01:30:45,184
[SPEAKER_04]: Committee of the whole.

998
01:30:45,344 --> 01:30:45,524
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

999
01:30:45,664 --> 01:30:45,984
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1000
01:30:46,104 --> 01:30:46,425
[SPEAKER_04]: Second.

1001
01:30:48,766 --> 01:30:49,567
[SPEAKER_12]: Roll call, please.

1002
01:30:50,267 --> 01:30:50,867
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Bramley.

1003
01:30:51,348 --> 01:30:51,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1004
01:30:51,768 --> 01:30:52,108
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, sorry.

1005
01:30:52,869 --> 01:30:53,429
[SPEAKER_09]: Memogram.

1006
01:30:55,210 --> 01:30:55,490
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1007
01:30:55,851 --> 01:30:58,152
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember McLaughlin?

1008
01:30:58,532 --> 01:30:58,812
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1009
01:30:58,933 --> 01:30:59,753
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember all the potting?

1010
01:30:59,893 --> 01:31:00,173
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1011
01:31:00,454 --> 01:31:00,714
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember?

1012
01:31:00,754 --> 01:31:01,174
[SPEAKER_09]: Reinfeld?

1013
01:31:01,754 --> 01:31:01,994
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1014
01:31:02,455 --> 01:31:02,775
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember?

1015
01:31:02,815 --> 01:31:03,596
[SPEAKER_09]: So yes, Marilyn.

1016
01:31:03,676 --> 01:31:03,916
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1017
01:31:04,116 --> 01:31:04,296
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

1018
01:31:04,796 --> 01:31:08,779
[SPEAKER_13]: So six in the affirmative one of the negative motion to send

1019
01:31:09,346 --> 01:31:11,447
[SPEAKER_13]: B and C to committee has been approved.

1020
01:31:12,827 --> 01:31:13,648
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

1021
01:31:15,249 --> 01:31:17,369
[SPEAKER_13]: We have no presentations of the public.

1022
01:31:19,871 --> 01:31:37,358
[SPEAKER_13]: We have no continued business and we do have one item under new business 2024-01 offered by member Graham, whereas the Metropolitan Public Schools recognizes the vital role of play in the development and wellbeing of students, whereas the current playground facilities at McGlynn Elementary are in need of replacement

1023
01:31:37,867 --> 01:31:41,750
[SPEAKER_13]: to create a safe and fun environment that meets the growing and diverse needs of our student body.

1024
01:31:42,331 --> 01:32:02,608
[SPEAKER_13]: And whereas the creation of new inclusive and engaging playground is a priority of the enhancement of our educational environment, now therefore be it resolved that the Medford School Committee, number one, establishes the McGlynn Playground Replacement Initiative and a donation campaign pursuant to policy FF, policy for dedication and naming of school buildings, facilities, and grounds.

1025
01:32:03,168 --> 01:32:06,251
[SPEAKER_13]: Number two, requests the administration establish a mechanism

1026
01:32:06,872 --> 01:32:17,697
[SPEAKER_13]: to account for and report on the donations, and three, request the administration set up a public relations campaign to solicit donations to the playground fund to offset the cost of replacing the playground.

1027
01:32:18,358 --> 01:32:24,421
[SPEAKER_13]: The promotion of the initiative will occur through school newsletters, local media, social media, and community events.

1028
01:32:24,761 --> 01:32:28,263
[SPEAKER_13]: The campaign will have the following objectives and donation tier structure.

1029
01:32:28,923 --> 01:32:32,525
[SPEAKER_13]: Objective, to raise funds for the construction of a new playground at McGlynn Elementary.

1030
01:32:33,396 --> 01:32:36,738
[SPEAKER_13]: that fosters a safe, inclusive, and stimulating environment for all students.

1031
01:32:37,459 --> 01:32:38,780
[SPEAKER_13]: Donation tier structure.

1032
01:32:39,240 --> 01:32:44,144
[SPEAKER_13]: Hopscotch Hero tier, donations 50 to 250, sorry, 249.

1033
01:32:45,184 --> 01:32:48,407
[SPEAKER_13]: Swing Set Superstar tier, donations 250 to 499.

1034
01:32:48,447 --> 01:32:49,648
[SPEAKER_13]: Slide Savant tier, donations of $500 to $999.

1035
01:32:50,728 --> 01:32:53,630
[SPEAKER_13]: Climbing Frame Champion tier, donations of 1,000 to $4,999.

1036
01:33:02,082 --> 01:33:23,151
[SPEAKER_13]: and the merry ground mastermind here donations of 5000 and above donor benefits will be the recognition in a district wide press release personalized thank you note signed by the school committee superintendent and school principal name on a plaque is a good one name on a plaque at the playground entrance and invitation to the playground ribbon cutting offered by member Graham.

1037
01:33:24,585 --> 01:33:24,905
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1038
01:33:26,047 --> 01:33:34,759
[SPEAKER_11]: I was not necessarily planning for this to happen on the same day as the playground groundbreaking but it was exciting it's sort of exciting that it is.

1039
01:33:36,081 --> 01:33:39,305
[SPEAKER_11]: So, when we, when we talked about.

1040
01:33:40,668 --> 01:33:46,450
[SPEAKER_11]: the adopting our policy around dedication and naming of buildings, facilities, and grounds, which is FF.

1041
01:33:46,510 --> 01:33:50,532
[SPEAKER_11]: And I did ask the superintendent to put this in your package just so you had it.

1042
01:33:51,652 --> 01:34:03,656
[SPEAKER_11]: Last year, sort of right at the same time, we were talking about the McGlynn playground and I offered to draft a resolution, which I have finally done.

1043
01:34:03,776 --> 01:34:08,958
[SPEAKER_11]: So my apologies for the delay to open up a donation

1044
01:34:10,006 --> 01:34:14,147
[SPEAKER_11]: mechanism for the community to participate in funding the playground.

1045
01:34:14,207 --> 01:34:38,995
[SPEAKER_11]: So while the vast majority of all the big components of the playground are funded, there is an opportunity for additional funding to offset the overall cost of the playground, but also to help us do things like put mature plantings in instead of much younger plantings that are going to take longer to create the shade that we're looking for or the

1046
01:34:40,532 --> 01:34:42,093
[SPEAKER_11]: structures that we wanna see.

1047
01:34:43,074 --> 01:34:52,001
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's plenty of opportunity and we know that money is not endless for these kinds of projects.

1048
01:34:52,021 --> 01:35:07,053
[SPEAKER_11]: So I put this forward totally not wed or tied to really any of it, except that the playground committee has talked about wanting to make sure that how people donate to the playground

1049
01:35:07,591 --> 01:35:24,989
[SPEAKER_11]: can be recognized in one central place and that we not be offering up naming rights to individual like pieces of equipment because it was the team's belief that we shouldn't, you shouldn't be able to buy your spot on a, an inclusive playground.

1050
01:35:26,563 --> 01:35:30,867
[SPEAKER_11]: I felt like a plaque on the outside that says, here's all the people who donated is a great way to do it.

1051
01:35:31,087 --> 01:35:33,369
[SPEAKER_11]: And maybe it's going to be a big plaque.

1052
01:35:33,409 --> 01:35:34,230
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's okay.

1053
01:35:34,250 --> 01:35:35,651
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe it's a sign instead of a plaque.

1054
01:35:35,671 --> 01:35:36,952
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's totally fine.

1055
01:35:38,113 --> 01:35:48,723
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think providing some sort of mechanism so that we can create a way for people to participate is important, but sort of stopping short of like

1056
01:35:49,190 --> 01:35:55,033
[SPEAKER_11]: naming things and bushes and pavers and cobblestones and I'm trying to stay away from that.

1057
01:35:55,133 --> 01:35:57,614
[SPEAKER_11]: I was trying to stay away from that in terms of the structure that I set up.

1058
01:35:57,674 --> 01:36:08,060
[SPEAKER_11]: So totally open to suggestions or changes and hopefully we can do this.

1059
01:36:08,280 --> 01:36:08,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, thank you.

1060
01:36:10,701 --> 01:36:16,624
[SPEAKER_04]: We were both part of the playground committee, so I appreciate the background and sharing the information about

1061
01:36:17,627 --> 01:36:21,928
[SPEAKER_04]: the intention of the donations and the community engagement involved.

1062
01:36:23,068 --> 01:36:28,890
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just want to make sure, again, that particularly it being an inclusive playground, that we are being inclusive.

1063
01:36:29,870 --> 01:36:31,550
[SPEAKER_04]: And so a few things.

1064
01:36:31,590 --> 01:36:33,451
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the plaque is obviously fine.

1065
01:36:34,211 --> 01:36:36,551
[SPEAKER_04]: Not naming individual things I think is clearly important.

1066
01:36:37,051 --> 01:36:44,533
[SPEAKER_04]: I also want to share with the committee and the community some of the gestation really of some of the inclusive playground work as well.

1067
01:36:45,294 --> 01:37:03,866
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I may have shared this, I know I shared this story with the playground committee, I'm not sure I shared it with school committee, but years ago, there was a student here who had significant medical needs and disability and was in a wheelchair and did not communicate with words and was in an out of district residential placement.

1068
01:37:04,506 --> 01:37:12,131
[SPEAKER_04]: In out of district residential placements, the students do come home during school vacations and on some occasions.

1069
01:37:12,872 --> 01:37:14,453
[SPEAKER_04]: And when that would occur, the student,

1070
01:37:14,914 --> 01:37:25,013
[SPEAKER_04]: had no opportunity in the community really to be engaged and involved, and was not able to really be part of the community and in the schools and mom in particular shared that story with us, the family was.

1071
01:37:26,704 --> 01:37:28,805
[SPEAKER_04]: from Brazil initially and had emigrated here.

1072
01:37:29,025 --> 01:37:36,047
[SPEAKER_04]: And mom was a single mom and had done a tremendous job and had shared that at a leadership, disability leadership program that we were in and they were Medford.

1073
01:37:37,127 --> 01:37:39,428
[SPEAKER_04]: The little girl passed away when she was 15.

1074
01:37:40,068 --> 01:37:42,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Her name is Emily Oliveira.

1075
01:37:42,909 --> 01:37:50,291
[SPEAKER_04]: She's actually in the Oakland Park Cemetery right next to Crystal and her picture's there.

1076
01:37:50,832 --> 01:37:55,133
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think she deserves to be remembered in particular around this inclusive playground

1077
01:37:55,749 --> 01:37:57,790
[SPEAKER_04]: and in particular around the swings.

1078
01:37:58,931 --> 01:38:03,494
[SPEAKER_04]: Mom really wanted a swing that was accessible for her wheelchair.

1079
01:38:04,154 --> 01:38:12,039
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would like some commemoration to Emily and her mom for what I feel like the community should have done for them a long time ago.

1080
01:38:12,099 --> 01:38:16,342
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know that mom would be really thrilled to see something like that for Emily.

1081
01:38:17,243 --> 01:38:19,584
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe some sort of picture of Emily.

1082
01:38:20,685 --> 01:38:21,425
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for sharing.

1083
01:38:21,726 --> 01:38:22,186
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Ruseau.

1084
01:38:22,625 --> 01:38:29,170
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wanted to second it, but since member McLaughlin has just spoken, I think I completely agree.

1085
01:38:29,190 --> 01:38:34,954
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope that this doesn't come across as any kind of like no names anywhere kind of thing.

1086
01:38:35,354 --> 01:38:37,976
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just like, you can't buy your name and it's the point.

1087
01:38:38,617 --> 01:38:40,658
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think that's an absolutely great idea.

1088
01:38:40,718 --> 01:38:50,886
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't know if we or the naming committee or somebody else should be involved in doing that because it's just an exceptionally good example of how

1089
01:38:52,230 --> 01:39:02,056
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, there is a place and a time for naming or names to be in a space, and that seems like an exceptionally good example, so thank you.

1090
01:39:02,136 --> 01:39:03,297
[SPEAKER_09]: So anyways, I seconded that.

1091
01:39:04,118 --> 01:39:07,540
[SPEAKER_13]: And just from the chair, I don't know if we wanna leave it a little bit open-ended.

1092
01:39:07,600 --> 01:39:20,728
[SPEAKER_13]: If we have hundreds and hundreds of people donating five, 10, 50 to $100, just leave it open-ended for either a subcommittee or the superintendent to decide whose name would go on a plaque.

1093
01:39:20,768 --> 01:39:21,589
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot of times,

1094
01:39:23,030 --> 01:39:24,491
[SPEAKER_13]: Or do we just put it on the website?

1095
01:39:24,511 --> 01:39:29,535
[SPEAKER_13]: I just think if you have hundreds and hundreds of names, I don't know how you're gonna, it will take up a whole fence.

1096
01:39:29,915 --> 01:39:30,295
[SPEAKER_04]: A wall.

1097
01:39:30,315 --> 01:39:31,376
[SPEAKER_04]: A whole wall.

1098
01:39:31,396 --> 01:39:32,717
[SPEAKER_13]: If that's what we wanna do, that's fine.

1099
01:39:32,777 --> 01:39:35,459
[SPEAKER_04]: I just... May I ask a follow-up question?

1100
01:39:36,120 --> 01:39:38,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Just particular to the donations as well.

1101
01:39:38,622 --> 01:39:44,166
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know if the process needs to be thought out at this point or if it already has been memorandum and you wanna share.

1102
01:39:45,226 --> 01:39:51,251
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm wondering, so where are the funds going and who's allocating this expenditures for

1103
01:39:52,172 --> 01:39:54,213
[SPEAKER_04]: improvements on the playground and that sort of thing.

1104
01:39:54,693 --> 01:39:54,953
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure.

1105
01:39:55,073 --> 01:40:21,204
[SPEAKER_11]: So, my expectation would be given that we don't know what we will generate in terms of revenue that once we have an idea of what that looks like, the playground committee will work with the builder or the contractor and the architect to figure out like are there features that needs that can be added like where do those mature plants go, etcetera that sort of makes sense or is it that

1106
01:40:22,564 --> 01:40:27,949
[SPEAKER_11]: we need to draw less from CPC or like what's the recommendation?

1107
01:40:27,989 --> 01:40:35,135
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would expect the playground subcommittee chairs to help lead that in concert with the city.

1108
01:40:37,537 --> 01:40:37,898
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1109
01:40:38,018 --> 01:40:45,265
[SPEAKER_04]: May I may I just so is there a timeline or is that will the motion have a timeline on donations or do you want to just deal with that later?

1110
01:40:46,005 --> 01:40:46,866
[SPEAKER_04]: So it sounds like

1111
01:40:47,216 --> 01:40:55,580
[SPEAKER_04]: I hear what you're saying, and I think that's a great idea, especially with the committee having worked for over a year on this and knowing a lot of the conversations that have occurred.

1112
01:40:55,660 --> 01:40:56,800
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that sounds great.

1113
01:40:57,580 --> 01:41:03,843
[SPEAKER_04]: That said, is there a window for the donations that the community can know about, or is that something that's still being thought about?

1114
01:41:05,684 --> 01:41:10,046
[SPEAKER_11]: I was sort of taking the approach that we'll always take your money.

1115
01:41:13,535 --> 01:41:39,166
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think to your point, like perhaps there is a timeframe where we say like, we'll, we'll like plan by this date and the playground committee might need to give us what that reasonable date is to say by that all the money received by this date, and maybe that's the like sort of one of the qualifiers like that we can add to this so we can maybe just add a placeholder for like a date certain that we will

1116
01:41:39,708 --> 01:41:42,050
[SPEAKER_11]: know finalize the plaque and do all of that stuff.

1117
01:41:42,450 --> 01:42:03,247
[SPEAKER_04]: So motion for amendment with the motion to have a date to be determined regarding the donations just to that end because if it is the developer of the playground committee that is talking about how that money is being spent and certainly money will be accepted after I'm sure but the monies that could be spent for the playground improvements and I guess really even thoughts of some

1118
01:42:03,880 --> 01:42:20,037
[SPEAKER_04]: mechanism for how it's going to work after if people donate money after where does that money go like I just don't want it to end up in some, you know, major fund at the school level necessarily not that they don't, it's not needed, but if people are donating specifically for the playground that it really should go to the playground.

1119
01:42:20,057 --> 01:42:24,502
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe I'm going to let Dr. Edwardson but maybe a maintenance account for the playground.

1120
01:42:26,229 --> 01:42:27,950
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I was going to say on the school side.

1121
01:42:28,931 --> 01:42:31,673
[SPEAKER_07]: Once we had access to the resolution.

1122
01:42:31,693 --> 01:42:42,922
[SPEAKER_07]: I was working with the business office and they are working on creating a playground, a playground account where people would be able to go online.

1123
01:42:43,842 --> 01:43:12,697
[SPEAKER_07]: Since there will be a press release and all of the other steps that were kind of detailed in the resolution we are working on having something where if people want to give to the playground there will be a specific account created for that so the money would go into that particular account and it is tax deductible so it would be properly documented and so we're working on that but again we just started the ball rolling on that but we would be able to

1124
01:43:14,083 --> 01:43:23,706
[SPEAKER_07]: have it on the school side so it could be properly documented, and then kept in that one area, specifically earmarked for the McGlynn playground.

1125
01:43:24,126 --> 01:43:30,508
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, anyone, any entrepreneurs out there, Miss bloom sack and others.

1126
01:43:31,508 --> 01:43:43,011
[SPEAKER_07]: Other wonderful friends and members of the community who want to be part of donating towards the equipment, it'll be there and kept in that sacred account.

1127
01:43:43,729 --> 01:43:44,089
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1128
01:43:44,990 --> 01:43:45,550
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Ruseau.

1129
01:43:45,870 --> 01:43:46,230
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1130
01:43:46,270 --> 01:43:49,812
[SPEAKER_09]: So for the language, let me know if this sounds okay.

1131
01:43:50,412 --> 01:44:00,237
[SPEAKER_09]: The playground committee will determine a date for which donors having given will appear on the plaque.

1132
01:44:00,878 --> 01:44:04,579
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll rephrase that to make a little more sense when I'm not just writing it in.

1133
01:44:04,900 --> 01:44:07,081
[SPEAKER_13]: Date to be determined based on the plaque.

1134
01:44:07,761 --> 01:44:08,361
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, whoever's.

1135
01:44:08,521 --> 01:44:08,782
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

1136
01:44:11,743 --> 01:44:13,024
[SPEAKER_09]: So on the amendment.

1137
01:44:15,040 --> 01:44:15,700
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll second that.

1138
01:44:18,161 --> 01:44:24,784
[SPEAKER_13]: And also just, Dr. Watt-Vincent pointed out, maybe it should just say plaque or sign.

1139
01:44:26,345 --> 01:44:26,525
Yeah.

1140
01:44:26,745 --> 01:44:29,386
[SPEAKER_13]: If we have 5,000 people who might want to sign.

1141
01:44:32,768 --> 01:44:39,511
[SPEAKER_13]: So motion for approval by Member Graham, I believe, amended by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member McLaughlin.

1142
01:44:39,531 --> 01:44:40,531
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, we're just going to do it all at once?

1143
01:44:40,551 --> 01:44:41,032
[SPEAKER_09]: That's fine.
