131
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:42,000
[SPEAKER_24]: So I would just sort of...

132
01:58:59,375 --> 01:59:00,456
[SPEAKER_27]: Hi again, how are we?

133
01:59:02,978 --> 01:59:12,487
[SPEAKER_27]: Christine, what's the average amount that the school lunch program takes in on a daily basis?

134
01:59:12,887 --> 01:59:15,249
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, I know, we're a little different.

135
01:59:15,610 --> 01:59:16,771
[SPEAKER_31]: So I have the time?

136
01:59:16,791 --> 01:59:17,772
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, no problem.

137
01:59:17,852 --> 01:59:19,493
[SPEAKER_27]: I was just curious to see what's up.

138
01:59:19,773 --> 01:59:23,337
[SPEAKER_27]: Is it coming out of the $10,000 Jeff gave us, or is that extra?

139
01:59:24,097 --> 01:59:24,678
[SPEAKER_27]: Ok.

140
01:59:57,642 --> 01:59:59,263
[SPEAKER_20]: Bob, can I get you to move down just a little?

141
02:00:01,243 --> 02:00:01,643
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

142
02:00:01,663 --> 02:00:02,304
[SPEAKER_20]: A little more.

143
02:00:02,864 --> 02:00:04,384
[SPEAKER_21]: A little more.

144
02:00:05,605 --> 02:00:05,985
[SPEAKER_21]: That's it.

145
02:00:06,065 --> 02:00:08,666
[SPEAKER_27]: Are you sure you don't want me out in the parking lot now?

146
02:00:08,686 --> 02:00:09,126
[SPEAKER_21]: No, that's good.

147
02:00:09,586 --> 02:00:11,427
[SPEAKER_27]: I can go out in the parking lot if you want me to.

148
02:00:11,447 --> 02:00:11,987
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

149
02:00:12,147 --> 02:00:13,427
[SPEAKER_27]: No problem.

150
02:00:24,329 --> 02:00:26,770
[SPEAKER_20]: So Erin is down at the zoning meeting.

151
02:00:26,890 --> 02:00:29,271
[SPEAKER_27]: They should have a larger table for us.

152
02:00:29,371 --> 02:00:30,151
[SPEAKER_27]: It's crazy.

153
02:00:30,171 --> 02:00:31,132
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I know.

154
02:00:31,172 --> 02:00:32,653
[SPEAKER_27]: I think we need longer tables.

155
02:00:32,693 --> 02:00:33,253
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi, Sebastian.

156
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:58,363
[SPEAKER_20]: I guess I didn't read this because I went down to... 

154
02:00:58,363 --> 02:01:06,00
[SPEAKER_27]: What happened, was it dark?

157
02:00:58,383 --> 02:01:00,285
[SPEAKER_20]: No, they're having a zoning meeting there.

158
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:08,100
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh.

159
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:18,000
[SPEAKER_27]: What are they trying to do?

157
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:29,000
[SPEAKER_20]: Erin is there. There's a concern about Tuft's zoning. I wonder about the other... so me and ...

160
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:44,850
[SPEAKER_20]: So we did not know, realize that the top here, we didn't catch that.

161
02:01:44,850 --> 02:01:45,350
[SPEAKER_21]: Nope.

162
02:01:45,671 --> 02:01:49,113
[SPEAKER_21]: I meant to ask you because I remember now after the fact.

163
02:01:49,173 --> 02:01:52,375
[SPEAKER_21]: Unfortunately, it's heating through Medford Square right now.

164
02:01:52,455 --> 02:01:54,096
[SPEAKER_21]: It's hard to, oh golly, well it is close to go home.

165
02:02:15,470 --> 02:02:17,331
[SPEAKER_21]: When we're here, it's hard to see across.

166
02:02:17,371 --> 02:02:18,652
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, you can start without them.

167
02:02:42,987 --> 02:02:44,169
[SPEAKER_21]: No, they're on the way.

168
02:02:44,189 --> 02:02:49,436
[SPEAKER_21]: Erin is attending the meeting, but Anne-Marie are coming.

169
02:02:49,576 --> 02:02:52,160
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I'd give them a little bit of time.

170
02:02:52,300 --> 02:02:57,648
[SPEAKER_21]: It was tough to get through Medford Square because of the, you know, all the cones and the police and... 

171
02:03:13,834 --> 02:03:15,435
[SPEAKER_21]: It's December, Bob, it's December.

172
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
[SPEAKER_27]: Who is Eunice Browne?

173
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
[SPEAKER_27]: Do you know her?

174
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, tell me about her.

175
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,000
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, so you and I are relics.

176
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,000
[SPEAKER_27]: She's gonna find herself in court.

177
02:03:40,271 --> 02:03:42,252
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, she called us relics.

178
02:03:42,413 --> 02:03:42,973
[SPEAKER_20]: I was so mad.

179
02:03:43,193 --> 02:03:46,455
[SPEAKER_27]: She didn't have too many nice things to say about me.

180
02:03:46,555 --> 02:03:53,000
[SPEAKER_27]: She should do her homework before she puts things on the internet.

181
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:57,000
[SPEAKER_27]: Suing her for a million dollars.

181
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:58,000
[SPEAKER_20]: Good for you.

182
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
[SPEAKER_27]: Straighten this teacher a lesson.

183
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:06,000
[SPEAKER_20]: I've never heard of her before this election.

184
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:06,000
[SPEAKER_27]: She's not registered to vote.

185
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:08,000
[SPEAKER_20]: Wow, are you serious?

186
02:04:07,900 --> 02:04:08,000
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes.

187
02:04:12,232 --> 02:04:13,273
[SPEAKER_20]: Why don't we just put that out?

188
02:04:13,333 --> 02:04:15,235
[SPEAKER_20]: She might not be in, for all I know.

189
02:04:15,275 --> 02:04:17,938
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know if she's an American citizen or not.

190
02:04:18,698 --> 02:04:20,000
[SPEAKER_20]: I just know that she just- 

190
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:20,300
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't know the woman.

191
02:04:20,320 --> 02:04:21,982
[SPEAKER_27]: I'd like to know what she looks like.

192
02:04:22,022 --> 02:04:22,782
[SPEAKER_21]: I can't tell you.

193
02:04:22,842 --> 02:04:23,623
[SPEAKER_21]: I've never met her.

194
02:04:24,464 --> 02:04:31,691
[SPEAKER_21]: You and I, because we're old, we're automatically, she called us relics, she called us many things.

195
02:04:32,251 --> 02:04:34,874
[SPEAKER_27]: She should keep her mouth shut.

196
02:04:34,894 --> 02:04:35,675
[SPEAKER_27]: She's not a taxpayer.

197
02:04:36,783 --> 02:04:37,003
[SPEAKER_21]: What?

198
02:04:37,163 --> 02:04:40,826
[SPEAKER_27]: I gotta tell you, she doesn't own any property either.

199
02:04:41,526 --> 02:04:43,788
[SPEAKER_21]: She just became like all of a sudden that way.

200
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:51,000
[SPEAKER_21]: That Medford Politics page is just insane.

201
02:04:54,491 --> 02:05:21,000
[SPEAKER_31]: Oh my gosh, what do you do? Do you have.... yes, well that's just... well look at this. And I'm listening a bit and I'm like, it's right here. I'm trying to salvage the note. I'll have to rewrite it.

202
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:28,153
[SPEAKER_31]: You know what I'll do?

203
02:05:28,193 --> 02:05:29,473
[SPEAKER_31]: There's not much here.

204
02:05:29,614 --> 02:05:30,534
[SPEAKER_31]: I'll turn this, okay?

205
02:05:30,634 --> 02:05:30,994
[SPEAKER_31]: All right.

206
02:05:31,054 --> 02:05:31,535
[SPEAKER_31]: Right here.

207
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:41,000
[SPEAKER_20]: Really, why?

208
02:05:32,535 --> 02:05:35,016
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm not hanging around.

209
02:05:35,176 --> 02:05:36,357
[SPEAKER_20]: Seriously, Bob?

210
02:05:46,289 --> 02:05:50,693
[SPEAKER_27]: Real estate taxes are ridiculous.

211
02:05:50,793 --> 02:05:53,135
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, you could downsize easily.

02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:54,000
[SPEAKER_27]: Where am I going to go?

212
02:05:53,615 --> 02:05:55,537
[SPEAKER_21]: And your house is probably worth a lot.

213
02:05:55,857 --> 02:05:59,220
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, that's why I want to strike while the striking's good.

213
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:02,000
[SPEAKER_21]: Where would you move to?

213
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,000
[SPEAKER_27]: Probably Myrtle Beach.

213
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:10,000
[SPEAKER_21]: I have to say, that sounds pretty good, but I don't think you should do it.

214
02:06:13,291 --> 02:06:17,438
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, if you want to go, we've got a lot of committee of the whole minute, so.

215
02:06:17,458 --> 02:06:18,920
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.

216
02:06:19,200 --> 02:06:20,182
[SPEAKER_21]: Do we have a quorum?

217
02:06:21,404 --> 02:06:22,205
[SPEAKER_27]: Let's rock and roll.

218
02:06:23,086 --> 02:06:25,831
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

219
02:06:25,871 --> 02:06:28,194

285
02:08:49,901 --> 02:08:50,882

298
02:10:15,654 --> 02:10:17,956
[SPEAKER_21]: It was a very substantial meeting, went on for hours.

299
02:10:18,736 --> 02:10:24,562
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, I just added that Superintendent Johnson made the following remarks the evenings.

300
02:10:24,742 --> 02:10:28,366
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, and by the way, sorry, it was there was a there was mistake.

301
02:10:28,446 --> 02:10:30,108
[SPEAKER_21]: It should be Bernadette Riccadeli.

302
02:10:30,768 --> 02:10:33,191
[SPEAKER_21]: Uh, so we addressed the four different issues.

303
02:10:34,092 --> 02:10:42,500
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, and the first item was the report of the North Medford bus capacity and ridership, uh, director of administration and finance Christine Patterson gave the

304
02:10:42,600 --> 02:10:43,981
[SPEAKER_21]: report and it's attached.

305
02:10:44,601 --> 02:10:48,564
[SPEAKER_21]: And Principal Tucci verified the report.

306
02:10:48,924 --> 02:10:57,710
[SPEAKER_21]: There are two buses coming from North Medford in the morning and in the afternoon there are between 45 to 50 riders daily which is within its capacity.

307
02:10:58,270 --> 02:11:00,272
[SPEAKER_21]: At this time there's no need to add another bus.

308
02:11:00,752 --> 02:11:04,475
[SPEAKER_21]: administration will keep the committee informed as demand increases.

309
02:11:04,695 --> 02:11:06,957
[SPEAKER_21]: The next item was student concussions.

310
02:11:07,338 --> 02:11:09,780
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, we talked about this at length.

311
02:11:10,460 --> 02:11:16,926
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, as part of our discussions, parent Tammy Simonotis spoke of her son's experience at Beverly High School.

312
02:11:17,066 --> 02:11:24,212
[SPEAKER_21]: She asserted that her son was injured during a JV soccer game and that there was inadequate trainer medical coverage by the Beverly staff.

313
02:11:24,732 --> 02:11:27,815
[SPEAKER_21]: She believes that the Beverly schools did not have a certified trainer at the game.

314
02:11:28,296 --> 02:11:30,940
[SPEAKER_21]: Her son suffered a head injury, chipped teeth and nosebleeds.

315
02:11:31,261 --> 02:11:33,745
[SPEAKER_21]: The concern focused upon safety at away games.

316
02:11:37,478 --> 02:11:44,720
[SPEAKER_21]: Members of our staff spoke with the athletic director at Beverly, but really haven't received any more news.

317
02:11:46,561 --> 02:11:52,742
[SPEAKER_21]: Mrs. Simone was pleased with how Medford handles injuries, but was very upset at the Beverly response.

318
02:11:54,783 --> 02:11:59,864
[SPEAKER_21]: Concern was particularly high because the game was allowed to go on after the injury took place.

319
02:12:00,885 --> 02:12:05,466
[SPEAKER_21]: The superintendent promised that he will be conferring with the MIA regarding this matter.

320
02:12:06,326 --> 02:12:15,733
[SPEAKER_21]: The next item under discussion was the field trip policy and administrators Paul Deliva, Tony Vento and Kathy Medaglio contributed comments during the discussions.

321
02:12:17,034 --> 02:12:24,740
[SPEAKER_21]: CPAC chairperson Melanie McLaughlin raised equity issues about the policy and commented that CPAC should have been consulted as the policy was formulated.

322
02:12:26,622 --> 02:12:32,646
[SPEAKER_21]: There was a discussion about the annual trip to New York by the Andrew School and the questions about deadlines.

323
02:12:36,049 --> 02:12:46,938
[SPEAKER_21]: Among the 90 students who attended, there were 19 students who either had an IEP or 504 plan, and this was 19% of the participants.

324
02:12:48,860 --> 02:12:54,145
[SPEAKER_21]: If we had added another bus, it would have cost approximately $7,500 and would not have made the trip doable.

325
02:12:55,140 --> 02:12:55,280
[SPEAKER_21]: Ms.

326
02:12:55,320 --> 02:13:02,804
[SPEAKER_21]: McLaughlin asserted that the trip excluded students with disabilities and that every trip should be planned to serve all interested students.

327
02:13:03,425 --> 02:13:04,766
[SPEAKER_21]: The issue raised several points.

328
02:13:05,226 --> 02:13:09,989
[SPEAKER_21]: Can field trips be planned with application deadlines if those deadlines are applicable to all students?

329
02:13:10,629 --> 02:13:13,671
[SPEAKER_21]: Should field trips be limited if the economics cannot be balanced?

330
02:13:14,131 --> 02:13:18,774
[SPEAKER_21]: And should the cost of medical services be shared by all participants or subsidized by the school system?

331
02:13:19,634 --> 02:13:21,716
[SPEAKER_21]: After continued discussion, the policy was tabled.

332
02:13:21,736 --> 02:13:24,979
[SPEAKER_21]: Administrators will bring forward a revised policy that addresses the issues.

333
02:13:25,659 --> 02:13:27,701
[SPEAKER_21]: The final issue of the evening was school brains.

334
02:13:28,321 --> 02:13:33,666
[SPEAKER_21]: Headmaster Perella and Data Information Specialist Registrar Curtis Tudin gave us a report.

335
02:13:35,067 --> 02:13:40,851
[SPEAKER_21]: The headmaster reported that changes had been made to address the GPA concerns raised during the spring by Mr. David Lu.

336
02:13:41,272 --> 02:13:45,075
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. Tudin provided a chart that showed the increase in usage by parents and teachers.

337
02:13:45,575 --> 02:13:46,957
[SPEAKER_21]: More will be done going forward.

338
02:13:47,237 --> 02:13:49,380
[SPEAKER_21]: This is a work in progress, but it is moving forward.

339
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:53,224
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. Liu was still skeptical about the accuracy of the reporting system.

340
02:13:53,624 --> 02:13:56,348
[SPEAKER_21]: He revisited his concerns from last spring.

341
02:13:56,748 --> 02:13:58,931
[SPEAKER_21]: Administrators asserted that the changes would work.

342
02:13:59,211 --> 02:14:01,854
[SPEAKER_21]: The school committee asked to be informed as the year progressed.

343
02:14:02,284 --> 02:14:06,369
[SPEAKER_21]: The meeting was adjourned at ten oh five respectfully submitted Paulette Van der Kloot secretary.

344
02:14:06,909 --> 02:14:07,189
[SPEAKER_31]: Very good.

345
02:14:07,230 --> 02:14:08,311
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you Miss Van der Kloot.

346
02:14:09,392 --> 02:14:09,812
[SPEAKER_31]: Miss Kreatz.

347
02:14:10,033 --> 02:14:11,815
[SPEAKER_31]: Yes, um, Superintendent Belson.

348
02:14:11,895 --> 02:14:13,256
[SPEAKER_31]: I just wanted to follow up with you.

349
02:14:13,697 --> 02:14:19,824
[SPEAKER_31]: Um, I was in touch with Miss Simonides and I just wanted to know if something was filed with the M.I.A.A.

350
02:14:20,284 --> 02:14:21,545
[SPEAKER_31]: regarding the incident.

351
02:14:22,066 --> 02:14:23,648
[SPEAKER_31]: If you've had a chance to file that yet.

352
02:14:24,853 --> 02:14:29,035
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so I have had substantial contact with the Beverly Public Schools.

353
02:14:29,796 --> 02:14:33,658
[SPEAKER_06]: They strongly dispute the account provided to us by Ms.

354
02:14:34,138 --> 02:14:34,718
[SPEAKER_06]: Simonides.

355
02:14:35,639 --> 02:14:38,540
[SPEAKER_06]: I've gone back and forth with Stephen Hershey, who is the superintendent there.

356
02:14:39,641 --> 02:14:46,605
[SPEAKER_06]: He claims, and he gave me the name of the trainer, the certified trainer who was on the field at that time.

357
02:14:46,685 --> 02:14:51,407
[SPEAKER_06]: He said that no trainer from Beverly did anything with the individual.

358
02:14:54,449 --> 02:14:58,595
[SPEAKER_06]: As a result, he feels that it may have been somebody else who just simply helped out on the sidelines.

359
02:14:59,256 --> 02:15:00,457
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have a lot more to do.

360
02:15:00,477 --> 02:15:07,647
[SPEAKER_06]: I did contact the MIAA briefly and told them that we're in the process of continuing to investigate what actually took place.

361
02:15:08,308 --> 02:15:09,310
[SPEAKER_06]: But there is a distinct

362
02:15:10,591 --> 02:15:15,615
[SPEAKER_06]: difference of opinion between what Beverly feels happened and what was reported to us.

363
02:15:16,236 --> 02:15:21,260
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's a little bit going on right now and I'll have more reports soon as I get a better chance to talk to all the parties.

364
02:15:21,720 --> 02:15:27,225
[SPEAKER_06]: The feeling from Beverly was that somebody assisted the student but not necessarily the trainer and that

365
02:15:28,906 --> 02:15:34,289
[SPEAKER_06]: The play was allowed to go forward without any reason to stop the play.

366
02:15:34,610 --> 02:15:45,856
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's back and forth, but Beverly strongly refutes the idea that their trainer assisted our student and also that the trainer was not licensed.

367
02:15:46,097 --> 02:15:48,118
[SPEAKER_06]: And they gave me the name and showed me the licensure.

368
02:15:48,902 --> 02:15:51,284
[SPEAKER_31]: did you communicate that information to the parent?

369
02:15:52,024 --> 02:15:53,365
[SPEAKER_06]: Not yet.

370
02:15:53,445 --> 02:15:54,386
[SPEAKER_06]: This is still going back.

371
02:15:54,446 --> 02:15:56,688
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, the latest communication was as late as today.

372
02:15:56,708 --> 02:15:58,189
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm Stephen Hershey.

373
02:15:58,829 --> 02:16:01,111
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've got a lot more work to do.

374
02:16:01,171 --> 02:16:04,153
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, obviously, there's a real difference of opinion in what took place.

375
02:16:04,934 --> 02:16:08,997
[SPEAKER_31]: So you got the name and the person is not certified?

376
02:16:09,117 --> 02:16:10,218
[SPEAKER_31]: They are.

377
02:16:10,838 --> 02:16:12,179
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually have it on my phone.

378
02:16:12,219 --> 02:16:13,500
[SPEAKER_06]: I can give it to you afterwards.

379
02:16:15,934 --> 02:16:27,317
[SPEAKER_21]: I guess that would raise the question to me is if our kids are playing and a student got hurt, why wasn't our student cared for by the trainer who was there?

380
02:16:27,557 --> 02:16:39,180
[SPEAKER_06]: According to the Beverly Public Schools, since the referee didn't stop the play, obviously he didn't consider it serious enough and that for some reason, you know,

381
02:16:40,416 --> 02:16:42,477
[SPEAKER_06]: that the assistance was done on the sidelines.

382
02:16:42,757 --> 02:16:48,120
[SPEAKER_06]: They suspect that somebody who maybe had a nursing background or something else like that may have helped on the sidelines.

383
02:16:48,140 --> 02:16:52,023
[SPEAKER_06]: The question is, why did the youngster go back in the game, too, if he had a kick in the head?

384
02:16:52,043 --> 02:16:54,044
[SPEAKER_06]: There are a couple of questions that still have to be answered.

385
02:16:54,444 --> 02:17:03,689
[SPEAKER_21]: And if the student, I believe the parent, told us that the student was bleeding, so why would the, I mean, we already talked about why didn't the referee stop the game?

386
02:17:04,049 --> 02:17:08,352
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, well, according to them, they didn't believe the referee needed to stop the game.

387
02:17:08,832 --> 02:17:14,719
[SPEAKER_06]: And secondly, you know, and without casting any aspersions on anyone, as you know, Mississimini's was not at the game.

388
02:17:15,300 --> 02:17:21,688
[SPEAKER_06]: And so as a result, we have a situation where people who were at the game have very different reports as to what took place there.

389
02:17:22,096 --> 02:17:31,100
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, but certainly blood is blood and if well, that's that's uh, you know an assumption that was made as to when the bleeding took place and who did what and where and I need more information.

390
02:17:31,120 --> 02:17:44,805
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, obviously we have a back and forth going on and I asked uh, Stephen Hershey who's the again superintendent of Beverly um, because mississippianities was contacting the Beverly school committee and others up in Beverly and uh,

391
02:17:45,706 --> 02:17:48,349
[SPEAKER_06]: They are siding with the Beverly public schools right now.

392
02:17:48,369 --> 02:18:02,385
[SPEAKER_06]: So I you know, I need a lot more Feeling as to what's really took place point of information man The superintendent has the game officials committee been contacted to find out who the referee was and I asked I asked for that information I haven't got it back yet.

393
02:18:02,405 --> 02:18:05,289
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay Also, have you spoke to the coach?

394
02:18:06,129 --> 02:18:07,809
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't speak to the coach, but Mr. Maloney did.

395
02:18:08,710 --> 02:18:10,270
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I'm going to get a follow up on that.

396
02:18:10,310 --> 02:18:18,472
[SPEAKER_06]: But again, today's information, which I just got today, is a direct refutation of the story we got.

397
02:18:19,113 --> 02:18:21,433
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I really need to ask a lot of questions.

398
02:18:21,613 --> 02:18:21,773
[SPEAKER_21]: Right.

399
02:18:21,893 --> 02:18:25,834
[SPEAKER_21]: But we do have the student who this happened to.

400
02:18:26,194 --> 02:18:28,535
[SPEAKER_21]: And we could have a follow up with the student.

401
02:18:28,555 --> 02:18:33,356
[SPEAKER_06]: I just don't know when it happened, how it happened, and the like.

402
02:18:33,376 --> 02:18:35,057
[SPEAKER_06]: I have two very different reports.

403
02:18:36,823 --> 02:18:37,003
[SPEAKER_28]: Ms.

404
02:18:37,023 --> 02:18:37,464
[SPEAKER_28]: Konyo.

405
02:18:39,267 --> 02:18:53,066
[SPEAKER_25]: When you find out from Beverly, or when you continue discussions with Beverly, could you find out, were they filming the game to see, you know, what type of play happened out there, or was there anyone filming the game to see what type of

406
02:18:54,247 --> 02:18:55,208
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

407
02:18:55,388 --> 02:18:56,569
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't do a film in the J.V.

408
02:18:56,589 --> 02:18:59,290
[SPEAKER_06]: game and they may have filmed the varsity game but I don't think from the J.V.

409
02:18:59,350 --> 02:18:59,530
[SPEAKER_06]: game.

410
02:18:59,731 --> 02:19:01,652
[SPEAKER_25]: Well sometimes it depends on the schools.

411
02:19:01,872 --> 02:19:03,013
[SPEAKER_25]: You might do it if the kids.

412
02:19:03,253 --> 02:19:05,474
[SPEAKER_25]: It could be someone else that just had their Facebook.

413
02:19:05,494 --> 02:19:06,155
[SPEAKER_25]: Not their Facebook.

414
02:19:06,175 --> 02:19:06,995
[SPEAKER_25]: Their cell phone.

415
02:19:07,435 --> 02:19:08,356
[SPEAKER_25]: And were filming too.

416
02:19:09,116 --> 02:19:14,480
[SPEAKER_25]: Just to see what type of play and if there is something out there that at least we could see what happened.

417
02:19:14,580 --> 02:19:16,101
[SPEAKER_25]: And as my colleague said I mean.

418
02:19:17,702 --> 02:19:29,335
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, especially when you're out there, I know the first thing is, is that when someone goes down and there is blood, especially if there's blood, that's the first thing that the student, the player is asked to step off the field.

419
02:19:31,030 --> 02:19:45,135
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me let me if I can mirror let me let me read you the latest communication from Stephen Hershey Because I'm putting on my cell phone and they'll give you an idea of you know, the strength of his comment It wasn't like I don't think anything happened.

420
02:19:45,655 --> 02:19:49,377
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very very, you know direct So let me read it to you.

421
02:19:49,397 --> 02:19:51,317
[SPEAKER_28]: So you're digging while you're getting that up.

422
02:19:51,878 --> 02:19:54,459
[SPEAKER_28]: Mr. Turangali our student representative sure

423
02:19:55,985 --> 02:20:05,229
[SPEAKER_43]: Um, a lot of the danger behind concussions is the lack of education that goes with it, um, and especially on the part of the coaches.

424
02:20:06,009 --> 02:20:18,635
[SPEAKER_43]: Um, and if the student does not know to take themselves out of the game, um, um, they'll put themselves at risk for a second damage to the brain, um, which is far worse than the first.

425
02:20:19,455 --> 02:20:25,418
[SPEAKER_43]: Um, so possibly, um, if we're thinking about our own education policy in the future and keeping our own kids safe,

426
02:20:26,324 --> 02:20:38,276
[SPEAKER_43]: I think this is a great example to show that we should push for Medford coaches to be aware of concussions in the game.

427
02:20:38,547 --> 02:20:40,228
[SPEAKER_25]: points of information they are very.

428
02:20:41,569 --> 02:20:43,990
[SPEAKER_25]: Just to address the street alleys.

429
02:20:45,071 --> 02:20:47,372
[SPEAKER_25]: The question of the discussion actually.

430
02:20:47,432 --> 02:20:51,594
[SPEAKER_25]: In my in my came out with a question.

431
02:20:52,635 --> 02:20:53,015
[SPEAKER_25]: Cushion.

432
02:20:53,796 --> 02:20:55,617
[SPEAKER_25]: Policy and a probably about.

433
02:20:56,517 --> 02:20:58,958
[SPEAKER_25]: Six years since Mitchell's been gone so about six years ago.

434
02:20:59,819 --> 02:21:04,602
[SPEAKER_25]: That everyone had to go through it the ironic part is that actually I argued with the referee.

435
02:21:05,402 --> 02:21:05,842
[SPEAKER_25]: to go through it.

436
02:21:05,882 --> 02:21:11,825
[SPEAKER_25]: And I think it's important for them to call themselves their organization because there is a policy out there that everyone has to go through.

437
02:21:12,285 --> 02:21:14,166
[SPEAKER_25]: And that is the coaches have to go through it.

438
02:21:14,507 --> 02:21:15,887
[SPEAKER_25]: Administration has to go through it.

439
02:21:15,927 --> 02:21:17,108
[SPEAKER_25]: The students have to go through it.

440
02:21:17,468 --> 02:21:18,829
[SPEAKER_25]: The parents have to go through it.

441
02:21:19,189 --> 02:21:23,131
[SPEAKER_25]: And at that point in time, and, of course, athletic directors had to go through it.

442
02:21:24,051 --> 02:21:28,834
[SPEAKER_25]: Nurses the only ones at that point in time that didn't have to go through it with the

443
02:21:33,796 --> 02:22:00,471
[SPEAKER_25]: uh... fought long and hard enough it finally came true and the referees have also have to go through it and um... just to give you a quick policy on that when a student has a concussion our athletic trainer actually before the season begins tests all our children and there's a certain way of testing them through the concussion uh... strategies that they have if by any chance a child does get hurt on the field then that child has to go back

444
02:22:00,731 --> 02:22:01,491
[SPEAKER_25]: to that trainer.

445
02:22:01,932 --> 02:22:02,972
[SPEAKER_25]: Gets evaluated.

446
02:22:03,312 --> 02:22:04,653
[SPEAKER_25]: Has to go to a doctor.

447
02:22:05,133 --> 02:22:13,557
[SPEAKER_25]: Will not be placed on that field again, not only with the clearance of a doctor, not only with the clearance of the nurses, but also with the clearance of the trainer.

448
02:22:13,877 --> 02:22:18,800
[SPEAKER_25]: And let me tell you, our trainer, she doesn't care which doctor clears you, you will not get on that field.

449
02:22:19,500 --> 02:22:21,901
[SPEAKER_25]: unless that trainer okays you.

450
02:22:22,481 --> 02:22:26,342
[SPEAKER_25]: And unfortunately, this was a situation that happened prior to that.

451
02:22:27,222 --> 02:22:28,183
[SPEAKER_25]: It happened on the field.

452
02:22:28,223 --> 02:22:33,284
[SPEAKER_25]: It happened away, you know, in experiences of, I'm going to say, on everyone.

453
02:22:33,644 --> 02:22:36,285
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, I understand that the student wanted, the player wanted to get back.

454
02:22:36,885 --> 02:22:38,566
[SPEAKER_25]: And, you know, it's like everything else.

455
02:22:38,786 --> 02:22:42,592
[SPEAKER_25]: player always wants to get back but we as adults have to take responsibility too.

456
02:22:42,953 --> 02:22:46,198
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm not blaming the coach, I'm not blaming our team, I'm not blaming anybody.

457
02:22:46,518 --> 02:22:52,528
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm just saying that there's certain things that we need to make decisions upon and now the superintendent is working with them.

458
02:22:53,208 --> 02:23:03,356
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't want to draw any conclusions until I have more investigation, but let me read you what Stephen Hershey wrote me today, and then attach some additional information which I'm exploring with others.

459
02:23:03,416 --> 02:23:03,876
[SPEAKER_06]: Good afternoon.

460
02:23:03,896 --> 02:23:05,657
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sending you copies of what I have in addition.

461
02:23:05,677 --> 02:23:07,539
[SPEAKER_06]: Your athletic director sent a letter to us.

462
02:23:07,619 --> 02:23:11,082
[SPEAKER_06]: I spoke with several Beverly parents I know usually attend the games.

463
02:23:11,182 --> 02:23:15,345
[SPEAKER_06]: While some of them remember the play, they do not report it as a significant injury.

464
02:23:15,905 --> 02:23:18,908
[SPEAKER_06]: They note that there was no stoppage of play, nor the issuance of a card.

465
02:23:19,429 --> 02:23:24,433
[SPEAKER_06]: Our trainer's name is Charla Berenas, and she has been with us for a long time without complaint.

466
02:23:24,914 --> 02:23:29,258
[SPEAKER_06]: Beverly has taken this seriously from the start, but I have been unable to verify what has been reported.

467
02:23:29,779 --> 02:23:33,382
[SPEAKER_06]: Our coaches and trainer are expected to deal with potential concussions with great caution.

468
02:23:33,943 --> 02:23:38,147
[SPEAKER_06]: We perform ongoing training to ensure we are attending to the safety of all athletes under our own

469
02:23:39,068 --> 02:23:40,149
[SPEAKER_06]: our players from other teams.

470
02:23:40,529 --> 02:23:41,710
[SPEAKER_06]: I would like to find out what happened.

471
02:23:41,730 --> 02:23:43,571
[SPEAKER_06]: Please forward me any information you have.

472
02:23:44,132 --> 02:23:46,094
[SPEAKER_06]: So, we have an ongoing investigation.

473
02:23:46,794 --> 02:23:51,618
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I can't draw a conclusion, you know, without more discussion with people.

474
02:23:51,919 --> 02:24:01,687
[SPEAKER_06]: This came through today, and we've got a little bit more to follow up, and I just don't want to draw conclusions until I'm comfortable that everyone has a chance to review the information back and forth.

475
02:24:02,668 --> 02:24:05,570
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll mark it for a report, follow-up report on our agenda?

476
02:24:05,770 --> 02:24:05,951
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

477
02:24:07,279 --> 02:24:11,182
[SPEAKER_28]: And is there a motion to accept this committee of the whole report from November 13th?

478
02:24:11,262 --> 02:24:12,363
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, actually amended.

479
02:24:12,423 --> 02:24:13,864
[SPEAKER_28]: I was not present at this meeting.

480
02:24:14,064 --> 02:24:14,825
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, second.

481
02:24:15,385 --> 02:24:17,307
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can add me to the chair.

482
02:24:19,768 --> 02:24:20,509
[SPEAKER_28]: I had you to it.

483
02:24:20,589 --> 02:24:21,190
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I wasn't.

484
02:24:21,230 --> 02:24:22,170
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I was present.

485
02:24:22,250 --> 02:24:24,452
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

486
02:24:25,593 --> 02:24:27,975
[SPEAKER_28]: Is there a motion for acceptance of the report as amended?

487
02:24:27,995 --> 02:24:31,077
[SPEAKER_28]: So I just seconded by Mr. Skerry.

488
02:24:31,177 --> 02:24:31,918
[SPEAKER_28]: All those in favor?

489
02:24:31,938 --> 02:24:32,318
[SPEAKER_28]: Aye.

490
02:24:32,598 --> 02:24:33,299
[SPEAKER_28]: All those opposed?

491
02:24:34,019 --> 02:24:34,720
[SPEAKER_28]: Motion passes.

492
02:24:36,144 --> 02:24:38,046
[SPEAKER_28]: The Committee of the Whole from November 15th.

493
02:24:38,466 --> 02:24:40,027
[SPEAKER_28]: We do not have that report yet.

494
02:24:40,248 --> 02:24:44,431
[SPEAKER_28]: I'd ask that one of my colleagues table this Committee of the Whole report.

495
02:24:44,451 --> 02:24:46,273
[SPEAKER_28]: So moved by Mr. Benedetto.

496
02:24:46,633 --> 02:24:47,674
[SPEAKER_28]: Seconded by Mr. Skerry.

497
02:24:47,694 --> 02:24:48,415
[SPEAKER_28]: All those in favor?

498
02:24:48,695 --> 02:24:48,815
[SPEAKER_24]: Aye.

499
02:24:49,196 --> 02:24:49,816
[SPEAKER_28]: All those opposed?

500
02:24:49,836 --> 02:24:50,957
[SPEAKER_28]: That paper is tabled.

501
02:24:51,618 --> 02:24:53,159
[SPEAKER_28]: Committee of the Whole, Minutes from November 27th, 2017.

502
02:24:57,321 --> 02:25:04,525
[SPEAKER_28]: This was a meeting that we held last week in order to discuss the succession plan for our superintendent of schools.

503
02:25:06,166 --> 02:25:07,247
[SPEAKER_28]: We had the Mass.

504
02:25:07,267 --> 02:25:09,188
[SPEAKER_28]: Association of School Committees present.

505
02:25:09,268 --> 02:25:15,811
[SPEAKER_28]: He presented quite a brochure to us on strategies that we should use in our deliberations.

506
02:25:16,952 --> 02:25:21,294
[SPEAKER_28]: Ultimately, the Medford School Committee voted on the following matters in Committee of the Whole.

507
02:25:22,635 --> 02:25:27,278
[SPEAKER_28]: that the MASC, Mass Associated School Committee, will provide a sample brochure to us.

508
02:25:28,059 --> 02:25:32,081
[SPEAKER_28]: The school committee will also explore other search consultants before making a selection.

509
02:25:32,782 --> 02:25:35,324
[SPEAKER_28]: The school committee voted to review internal candidates first.

510
02:25:35,364 --> 02:25:36,624
[SPEAKER_28]: That was a 7-0 vote.

511
02:25:37,285 --> 02:25:42,769
[SPEAKER_28]: And the school committee voted to meet again on December 11, 2017 to continue its work.

512
02:25:43,469 --> 02:25:48,713
[SPEAKER_28]: We also had quite a bit of discussion around a search committee if we ultimately do go outside.

513
02:25:48,773 --> 02:25:51,775
[SPEAKER_28]: What was explained to us is if we do internal candidates,

514
02:25:52,735 --> 02:25:55,657
[SPEAKER_28]: It would be school committee interviewing in a public session.

515
02:25:56,457 --> 02:26:02,641
[SPEAKER_28]: If from there we go to a full search, a nationwide search, let's say, we would form a committee.

516
02:26:02,941 --> 02:26:21,133
[SPEAKER_28]: And the complement of that committee would be set up of three teachers from the different levels of schooling, one administrator, one student, school committee members, suggested was three, and also community members being parents.

517
02:26:21,693 --> 02:26:29,076
[SPEAKER_28]: And we also wanted to make sure that we included all subgroups such as special ed and ELL in those check boxes.

518
02:26:29,116 --> 02:26:31,117
[SPEAKER_28]: So we're working on an actual application.

519
02:26:31,497 --> 02:26:37,059
[SPEAKER_28]: For those out there, we're working on a formal application that people can fill out and submit back to us if they have an interest.

520
02:26:37,599 --> 02:26:40,940
[SPEAKER_28]: Also, I ask that our diversity director be a member of this committee.

521
02:26:41,420 --> 02:26:43,281
[SPEAKER_28]: It was voted on in seven to zero.

522
02:26:43,381 --> 02:26:44,862
[SPEAKER_28]: So thank you all for that.

523
02:26:45,482 --> 02:26:48,683
[SPEAKER_28]: And we will be meeting next week to discuss this further on December 11th.

524
02:26:49,043 --> 02:26:50,404
[SPEAKER_28]: Mr. Superintendent, is that up here?

525
02:26:51,084 --> 02:26:52,765
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes, that is in the high school.

526
02:26:52,785 --> 02:26:53,785
[SPEAKER_06]: It will be in the conference room.

527
02:26:54,866 --> 02:26:58,648
[SPEAKER_28]: Is there a motion to accept this report and place it on file to accept the report, please?

528
02:26:58,668 --> 02:27:01,729
[SPEAKER_28]: Motion to accept by Mr. No seconded by Mr. Skerry.

529
02:27:01,749 --> 02:27:02,570
[SPEAKER_28]: All those in favor.

530
02:27:03,410 --> 02:27:04,151
[SPEAKER_28]: All those opposed.

531
02:27:04,291 --> 02:27:05,051
[SPEAKER_28]: Motion passes.

532
02:27:06,212 --> 02:27:07,592
[SPEAKER_28]: Community participation.

533
02:27:07,652 --> 02:27:10,394
[SPEAKER_28]: Miss Retta Smith regarding the school breakfast program.

534
02:27:11,074 --> 02:27:12,575
[SPEAKER_28]: Mia, did you want to say a few words or no?

535
02:27:13,255 --> 02:27:13,715
[SPEAKER_28]: Go read it.

536
02:27:17,464 --> 02:27:21,608
[SPEAKER_06]: You've been handed a report tonight that was prepared, that was sent to us.

537
02:27:21,648 --> 02:27:28,074
[SPEAKER_28]: So on our desk is a report on the 2017 breakfast participation rates as well as some literature.

538
02:27:29,896 --> 02:27:30,877
[SPEAKER_32]: Good evening everyone.

539
02:27:31,657 --> 02:27:35,861
[SPEAKER_32]: So I was asked to present some information on the school breakfast program.

540
02:27:36,262 --> 02:27:42,888
[SPEAKER_32]: So I am a registered dietitian and I am the nutritionist for the food services department for Medford Public Schools.

541
02:27:43,628 --> 02:27:47,311
[SPEAKER_32]: Just some general information, we offer breakfast at all of our schools.

542
02:27:47,951 --> 02:27:53,535
[SPEAKER_32]: Most of them, it's traditional style offered before school begins in the cafeteria.

543
02:27:54,436 --> 02:27:58,899
[SPEAKER_32]: Three of them offer breakfast free of charge for any student interested.

544
02:27:59,500 --> 02:28:07,546
[SPEAKER_32]: One of those three has breakfast not in the cafeteria before school, but in the classroom after the bell, and it counts as learning time.

545
02:28:08,622 --> 02:28:21,077
[SPEAKER_32]: So if you look at the sheet that has the breakfast participation rates, if you look at the last column, the percent ADP, so the percentage of average daily participation, it ranges from 0% to 86 almost percent.

546
02:28:21,097 --> 02:28:22,699
[SPEAKER_32]: So this really shows the

547
02:28:26,543 --> 02:28:29,464
[SPEAKER_32]: drastic variance in participation rates.

548
02:28:29,984 --> 02:28:36,626
[SPEAKER_32]: So the Columbus, the McGlynn Elementary, and Middle School all are offering universally free breakfasts.

549
02:28:37,326 --> 02:28:51,931
[SPEAKER_32]: So if you take a look at just those three using the October 2017 data, the McGlynn Elementary School had almost 29% participation, the Middle School was almost 21, and the Columbus was at about 86.

550
02:28:53,391 --> 02:28:57,215
[SPEAKER_32]: So the Columbus is the school that offers breakfast in the classroom for everyone.

551
02:28:57,255 --> 02:29:00,819
[SPEAKER_32]: So you can see the difference that that really makes in the participation rates.

552
02:29:01,600 --> 02:29:05,243
[SPEAKER_32]: And this is not something that is unique to our district.

553
02:29:05,704 --> 02:29:13,592
[SPEAKER_32]: The EOS Foundation, which is a nonprofit organization that really promotes school breakfast being offered after the bell, they have seen this

554
02:29:14,196 --> 02:29:24,581
[SPEAKER_32]: statewide that schools offering free breakfasts in a traditional setting before the bell experience participation rates far lower than those who offer it in the classroom.

555
02:29:25,842 --> 02:29:30,244
[SPEAKER_32]: Could you explain why the Columbus offers it after the bell versus the others before?

556
02:29:31,424 --> 02:29:32,345
[SPEAKER_32]: So that's a good question.

557
02:29:32,425 --> 02:29:38,848
[SPEAKER_32]: The McGlynn Middle School, this is its first year instituting the universal, so I don't know what the decision was

558
02:29:39,306 --> 02:29:41,047
[SPEAKER_32]: They're the elementary school.

559
02:29:41,567 --> 02:29:46,629
[SPEAKER_32]: From what I'm told a few years ago, I think this was before I started working here, there was a rodent issue.

560
02:29:46,769 --> 02:29:54,693
[SPEAKER_32]: They originally started off doing a breakfast in the class model, and there was a rodent issue that was attributed to the breakfast program, so they stopped.

561
02:29:55,053 --> 02:29:59,595
[SPEAKER_28]: So Mr. Superintendent, are the principals deciding whether it's before or after the bell?

562
02:29:59,795 --> 02:30:00,195
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty much.

563
02:30:00,495 --> 02:30:00,895
[SPEAKER_28]: Pretty much?

564
02:30:01,156 --> 02:30:01,316
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah.

565
02:30:02,296 --> 02:30:03,997
[SPEAKER_28]: Can we ask them to all reevaluate?

566
02:30:04,277 --> 02:30:04,477
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.

567
02:30:06,817 --> 02:30:08,198
[SPEAKER_32]: Would that be a recommendation you'd make?

568
02:30:08,379 --> 02:30:14,966
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah, that was my, I just wanted to have you, you know, consider this information and questions of universal breakfast going forward.

569
02:30:15,006 --> 02:30:17,008
[SPEAKER_06]: There's probably another factor too in terms of busing.

570
02:30:17,248 --> 02:30:25,197
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, the more busing that takes place, the less likely they are to arrive, you know, and take it before the actual school starts.

571
02:30:25,817 --> 02:30:26,799
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh, right, yes, yeah.

572
02:30:26,939 --> 02:30:28,861
[SPEAKER_32]: That has a big impact in participation as well, yeah.

573
02:30:29,209 --> 02:30:29,969
[SPEAKER_26]: Mr. Benedetto?

574
02:30:30,270 --> 02:30:31,170
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

575
02:30:31,350 --> 02:30:35,673
[SPEAKER_26]: Could you tell me what the percentage of the forms returned are for each building?

576
02:30:35,693 --> 02:30:36,293
[SPEAKER_26]: Do you know that?

577
02:30:36,373 --> 02:30:38,074
[SPEAKER_26]: So the free and reduced eligibility?

578
02:30:38,094 --> 02:30:45,599
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, whether they sign that they need it or they return the form saying that they're not eligible but they have to sign their form.

579
02:30:45,619 --> 02:30:49,141
[SPEAKER_26]: Does every student sign have a form returned?

580
02:30:49,922 --> 02:30:50,162
[SPEAKER_26]: No.

581
02:30:50,622 --> 02:30:54,505
[SPEAKER_26]: And how do we get like two parents that

582
02:30:56,416 --> 02:31:14,301
[SPEAKER_26]: don't know what this is and it's coming home and they're not knowing to turn them back in and get the quote we need because that would change a lot and do parents know that this also reflects in whether or not they pay for SAT exams as well as college applications.

583
02:31:14,661 --> 02:31:19,803
[SPEAKER_26]: Their free and reduced lunch has bigger implications other than just foods on a daily basis.

584
02:31:20,243 --> 02:31:35,978
[SPEAKER_26]: And I don't think, like up at the high school, you might not get any forms, but if they knew that that was tied in and there was like a campaign to really educate people throughout the community, I think that our numbers could actually be higher than what they're listed here.

585
02:31:36,318 --> 02:31:36,538
[SPEAKER_26]: Right.

586
02:31:37,279 --> 02:31:47,703
[SPEAKER_26]: So that that's concerning to me and I think we have to have like almost 100% return rate for building and like really make it like a campaign or part of re-registration at each year.

587
02:31:48,504 --> 02:31:55,046
[SPEAKER_26]: So that way we we are making sure we capture hungry families as well as giving all those alternative

588
02:31:56,687 --> 02:31:57,408
[SPEAKER_26]: processes.

589
02:31:57,588 --> 02:32:10,541
[SPEAKER_26]: So I would really like to know how many forms were returned per school, like broken down by school, as well as a plan for outreach for next year, so that way we are reaching every family.

590
02:32:10,601 --> 02:32:13,925
[SPEAKER_26]: They either sign off yes or they sign off no.

591
02:32:14,185 --> 02:32:19,551
[SPEAKER_26]: I know it's a big job and a big undertaking, but I think it's well worth it in the community because I don't think people

592
02:32:20,503 --> 02:32:30,499
[SPEAKER_26]: especially non-English families knowing that there are other things that this qualifies them for and it's so important to make sure that they get food.

593
02:32:32,304 --> 02:32:40,326
[SPEAKER_33]: Yes, I'd like to comment on that, that we have engaged and made sure that we have the free and reduced applications in multiple languages.

594
02:32:40,506 --> 02:32:41,466
[SPEAKER_33]: They are returned.

595
02:32:41,966 --> 02:32:44,707
[SPEAKER_33]: There is not a requirement for them to be returned.

596
02:32:44,767 --> 02:32:46,487
[SPEAKER_33]: That's not a forced item.

597
02:32:46,547 --> 02:32:53,969
[SPEAKER_33]: However, we are capturing more free and reduced qualifications because they are incorporated within the portal.

598
02:32:54,269 --> 02:32:56,069
[SPEAKER_33]: So we automatically draw those down.

599
02:32:56,431 --> 02:33:00,474
[SPEAKER_33]: So it's not necessary that we receive an actual form back from every household.

600
02:33:00,815 --> 02:33:06,440
[SPEAKER_33]: We are gathering those and getting those counts regardless through the portals that have.

601
02:33:06,960 --> 02:33:12,725
[SPEAKER_33]: That's why we've encouraged additional services and we've had outreach with our parent information center.

602
02:33:13,105 --> 02:33:24,595
[SPEAKER_33]: So we are providing much more detailed information and encouraging families to participate in these other systems that will provide them additional resources and then also

603
02:33:25,330 --> 02:33:27,971
[SPEAKER_33]: automatically qualify them for free or reduced.

604
02:33:29,252 --> 02:33:34,514
[SPEAKER_26]: And my point, too, is sometimes there's awards for 100% return rate for classes.

605
02:33:34,854 --> 02:33:43,597
[SPEAKER_26]: They get really getting the word out and being a campaign so that the word goes home and people are excited and learning about it because they don't pay attention to every form.

606
02:33:44,057 --> 02:33:46,058
[SPEAKER_26]: And it's so important to feed our children.

607
02:33:46,318 --> 02:33:52,420
[SPEAKER_26]: And it's so important for kids that say, oh, we don't have money for our college applications.

608
02:33:52,480 --> 02:33:53,241
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm not applying.

609
02:33:54,537 --> 02:34:08,559
[SPEAKER_26]: you know, the tests are covered and the applications are cheaper and like it's so many, many more aspects of this, as well as our district could receive more federal funding because of our percentage rates.

610
02:34:10,051 --> 02:34:11,251
[SPEAKER_26]: That's just a suggestion.

611
02:34:11,331 --> 02:34:13,892
[SPEAKER_26]: I think I made it maybe last year as well.

612
02:34:14,312 --> 02:34:16,213
[SPEAKER_06]: So let me just make one clarification.

613
02:34:16,253 --> 02:34:17,573
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the breakfast program.

614
02:34:17,853 --> 02:34:21,254
[SPEAKER_06]: This is not the total numbers of students on free and reduced.

615
02:34:22,274 --> 02:34:27,116
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, not everybody comes in early enough for breakfast, especially at the high school and places like that.

616
02:34:27,196 --> 02:34:34,718
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll give you a report with the total numbers because they're much higher when you look at the school lunch program as opposed to the

617
02:34:35,478 --> 02:34:40,361
[SPEAKER_06]: breakfast program, which is a more, let's say, niche program that not everybody participates in.

618
02:34:41,082 --> 02:34:45,985
[SPEAKER_06]: It's one that, you know, we'd like to increase, but then we've talked to Andrea Silbert over at EOS, you know, many times.

619
02:34:47,706 --> 02:34:52,389
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think that the breakfast program doesn't give you a full, accurate picture.

620
02:34:52,429 --> 02:34:59,173
[SPEAKER_06]: If just at the high school alone, the number of youngsters who are in free and reduced who don't pay a user fee for athletics would tell you that it's much higher than this.

621
02:34:59,693 --> 02:34:59,973
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay?

622
02:35:00,213 --> 02:35:02,054
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll give you that report.

623
02:35:04,438 --> 02:35:07,131
[SPEAKER_26]: Motion to have that report presented to the school committee.

624
02:35:07,449 --> 02:35:07,709
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

625
02:35:07,729 --> 02:35:07,869
[SPEAKER_06]: Second.

626
02:35:08,249 --> 02:35:10,691
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Miss Vanderpool.

627
02:35:11,131 --> 02:35:15,474
[SPEAKER_21]: I noticed that the Tufts alternative school has a very low participation.

628
02:35:15,774 --> 02:35:22,778
[SPEAKER_21]: And this really surprised me because I would think it would almost be the natural environment where kids would be coming in and might pick up some breakfast at school.

629
02:35:22,798 --> 02:35:24,439
[SPEAKER_21]: Do you have any insight into that number?

630
02:35:24,599 --> 02:35:26,700
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah, I was really surprised by that also.

631
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:32,944
[SPEAKER_32]: So we contacted Mr. to me over there, and he said that because they're allowed to come in so much

632
02:35:36,966 --> 02:35:40,789
[SPEAKER_32]: And they can ask for breakfast, but they don't.

633
02:35:41,310 --> 02:35:49,257
[SPEAKER_32]: But I do think that that's definitely an area of opportunity, especially if you could offer a breakfast that might be an incentive for students to come in.

634
02:35:49,277 --> 02:35:57,864
[SPEAKER_21]: And the other thing I noticed is most of the schools we see an increase between September and October.

635
02:35:58,305 --> 02:36:00,827
[SPEAKER_21]: There was only one school where there was a slight decline.

636
02:36:01,420 --> 02:36:11,675
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, and I'm just want to make sure that we keep on looking at these numbers because I wouldn't want there to be any stigma attached to, um, kids going in for breakfast.

637
02:36:11,935 --> 02:36:14,099
[SPEAKER_21]: That's why I think the classroom is right.

638
02:36:14,159 --> 02:36:15,340
[SPEAKER_21]: Environment really is ideal.

639
02:36:17,108 --> 02:36:30,295
[SPEAKER_21]: And, you know, sort of if it works at the Columbus, you know, maybe if we could talk to some of the principals and ask another one to try it for a month and see how it goes, just to see what kind of participation we have then.

640
02:36:30,515 --> 02:36:30,756
[SPEAKER_32]: Right.

641
02:36:31,316 --> 02:36:42,462
[SPEAKER_32]: I know for the past two years in a row, the Eos Foundation has awarded the Columbus a Healthy Start award, and they give those to schools that see breakfast participation rates.

642
02:36:42,955 --> 02:36:47,619
[SPEAKER_32]: at 80% and higher for so many consecutive months over the course of a year.

643
02:36:47,659 --> 02:36:50,701
[SPEAKER_32]: So I mean, their average is over 80% year long.

644
02:36:50,721 --> 02:36:53,323
[SPEAKER_32]: That's great.

645
02:36:53,943 --> 02:36:54,043
OK.

646
02:36:54,824 --> 02:37:03,110
[SPEAKER_28]: So on the motion by Mr. Benedetto, and also I ask that the superintendent reach out to the various principals to determine if they could do after the bell breakfast.

647
02:37:03,851 --> 02:37:05,172
[SPEAKER_28]: On that motion, all those in favor?

648
02:37:05,192 --> 02:37:05,872
[SPEAKER_28]: Aye.

649
02:37:05,932 --> 02:37:06,673
[SPEAKER_28]: All those opposed?

650
02:37:06,933 --> 02:37:07,653
[SPEAKER_28]: Motion passes.

651
02:37:08,054 --> 02:37:08,874
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you very much, Ms.

652
02:37:08,954 --> 02:37:09,174
[SPEAKER_28]: Smith.

653
02:37:10,335 --> 02:37:17,722
[SPEAKER_21]: I'd like to make a motion to suspend the order of business so that we can take up the report on student survey on substance abuse.

654
02:37:17,782 --> 02:37:19,904
[SPEAKER_28]: There's a motion for suspension of the rules.

655
02:37:20,025 --> 02:37:20,385
[SPEAKER_28]: Second.

656
02:37:20,785 --> 02:37:21,606
[SPEAKER_28]: Seconded by Ms.

657
02:37:21,646 --> 02:37:22,046
[SPEAKER_28]: Cuno.

658
02:37:22,066 --> 02:37:22,907
[SPEAKER_28]: All those in favor?

659
02:37:22,927 --> 02:37:23,388
[SPEAKER_28]: Aye.

660
02:37:23,828 --> 02:37:24,529
[SPEAKER_28]: All those opposed?

661
02:37:24,589 --> 02:37:25,450
[SPEAKER_28]: Motion passes.

662
02:37:25,670 --> 02:37:29,914
[SPEAKER_26]: Mayor Burke, we'll report on student survey before our nutritionist leaves.

663
02:37:30,994 --> 02:37:40,660
[SPEAKER_26]: I saw on some social media that the Columbus School was talking about maybe sour milk at some of the things and asked that they just look into that.

664
02:37:41,260 --> 02:37:50,765
[SPEAKER_26]: I saw on some social media at the McGlen and definitely at the Columbus, I saw some posts about children not taking the milk because they felt the milk was sour.

665
02:37:51,266 --> 02:37:58,870
[SPEAKER_32]: Yes, yes, we are aware of that and I guess what I can say in response to that is we handle the milks appropriately.

666
02:37:59,290 --> 02:38:01,451
[SPEAKER_32]: We use a first in first out rotation system.

667
02:38:01,491 --> 02:38:08,212
[SPEAKER_32]: So the the oldest milks, you know, are the first ones that are in the coolers and leaving the cooler up.

668
02:38:09,212 --> 02:38:09,853
[SPEAKER_32]: Make them colder.

669
02:38:10,093 --> 02:38:13,794
[SPEAKER_32]: I mean, all of all of the the refrigerators are keeping at temp.

670
02:38:13,814 --> 02:38:17,715
[SPEAKER_32]: So I think this might potentially be a supplier issue.

671
02:38:18,715 --> 02:38:20,995
[SPEAKER_32]: So we'll have to be monitoring.

672
02:38:21,455 --> 02:38:21,696
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah.

673
02:38:22,216 --> 02:38:27,497
[SPEAKER_32]: But what I can say is from our handling of everything, we're doing everything that we

674
02:38:28,208 --> 02:38:34,695
[SPEAKER_32]: can to ensure that the milks are at a safe temperature and they are within the best by date.

675
02:38:34,735 --> 02:38:36,257
[SPEAKER_32]: So they should be good.

676
02:38:36,277 --> 02:38:42,223
[SPEAKER_32]: But we have to figure out why they're not.

677
02:38:42,243 --> 02:38:45,106
[SPEAKER_28]: School committee elect, would you like to step up to the mic, please?

678
02:38:51,677 --> 02:39:01,563
[SPEAKER_07]: I had a question about whether the in-class breakfast, how is the milk transported to the classes and how long does it sit in the classes and come back and over and over multiple times a day?

679
02:39:01,583 --> 02:39:06,886
[SPEAKER_07]: How do you track that the milk isn't the same milk going to the class for four or five days in a row?

680
02:39:07,507 --> 02:39:11,129
[SPEAKER_07]: And is it actually kept cold while it's sitting in the class for an hour or two?

681
02:39:11,569 --> 02:39:12,350
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah.

682
02:39:12,410 --> 02:39:14,871
[SPEAKER_32]: So this is for the breakfast in the classroom?

683
02:39:14,971 --> 02:39:15,592
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah.

684
02:39:15,612 --> 02:39:19,294
[SPEAKER_32]: So the breakfast items are transported in coolers.

685
02:39:20,054 --> 02:39:33,127
[SPEAKER_32]: and they are, they leave that morning and go, and I don't know what the exact time frame is, but they're kept in coolers, and so they are used, probably I would say within an hour, and any of the milks that come back are discarded.

686
02:39:34,689 --> 02:39:37,451
[SPEAKER_32]: So that should not be contributing to the issue.

687
02:39:39,453 --> 02:39:39,794
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

688
02:39:41,838 --> 02:39:47,561
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, item four, based on suspension of the rules, report on student survey on substance abuse.

689
02:39:48,241 --> 02:39:49,102
[SPEAKER_28]: We have with us Ms.

690
02:39:49,182 --> 02:39:55,105
[SPEAKER_28]: Penny Funny Ali from Medford City Hall Team Medford to do a presentation.

691
02:39:55,125 --> 02:39:57,606
[SPEAKER_28]: Do you need us to move at all?

692
02:39:57,666 --> 02:39:57,946
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe.

693
02:39:58,346 --> 02:40:01,027
[SPEAKER_18]: Let me just turn on this projector and we shall see.

694
02:40:11,356 --> 02:40:12,560
[SPEAKER_27]: It's going on.

695
02:40:12,761 --> 02:40:14,166
[SPEAKER_28]: It's going on.

696
02:40:14,527 --> 02:40:14,989
[SPEAKER_28]: It's kicking in.

697
02:40:27,236 --> 02:40:29,457
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, so thank you for having me today.

698
02:40:29,577 --> 02:40:43,942
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm here to present the data, but I do not do my work alone, and Tony Bento and Rachel Perry are here to talk about the work that they do in the schools that really support youth substance use and prevention of youth substance use in the city.

699
02:40:46,704 --> 02:40:49,747
[SPEAKER_18]: I just want to say this is a report on a survey called the Community Care Survey.

700
02:40:49,767 --> 02:40:51,989
[SPEAKER_18]: We've been doing this survey since 2005.

701
02:40:53,050 --> 02:41:01,697
[SPEAKER_18]: It's done every two years, so we have a long amount of years to see trends that have changed throughout the time of the city.

702
02:41:03,639 --> 02:41:11,264
[SPEAKER_18]: Some of the things to note are that what it looks at is it looks at risk and protective factors as well as frequency of reported use.

703
02:41:11,284 --> 02:41:20,771
[SPEAKER_18]: So this is, the youth take this survey, it's an anonymous survey, it comes back to us, we send it to, excuse me, it goes from the school directly to the

704
02:41:21,551 --> 02:41:23,272
[SPEAKER_18]: The researcher who cleans the data.

705
02:41:24,333 --> 02:41:33,320
[SPEAKER_18]: By cleaning the data, what I mean is that they eliminate any surveys that exaggerate drug use or any other antisocial behavior.

706
02:41:33,961 --> 02:41:44,889
[SPEAKER_18]: They eliminate surveys where students report a fictitious drug that's on there, and then anything that's logically inconsistent patterns of drug use, they will eliminate those surveys.

707
02:41:45,229 --> 02:41:50,233
[SPEAKER_18]: So let's say they had 100 that were not, you know, valid, they will eliminate those.

708
02:41:50,413 --> 02:41:53,214
[SPEAKER_18]: That will not be included in the total count for the survey itself.

709
02:41:55,335 --> 02:42:09,140
[SPEAKER_18]: But what it's doing is it's looking at—we don't ask questions about sexuality, but what risk and protective factors do is that really show what drives young people to do things that are risky.

710
02:42:10,200 --> 02:42:13,483
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's why we're looking at this larger picture snapshot.

711
02:42:13,843 --> 02:42:19,187
[SPEAKER_18]: A lot of communities use a youth risk behavior survey and it really looks at the frequency.

712
02:42:19,487 --> 02:42:22,309
[SPEAKER_18]: It doesn't look at some of the community conditions.

713
02:42:22,710 --> 02:42:25,292
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's a large report.

714
02:42:25,372 --> 02:42:27,153
[SPEAKER_18]: We've broken it up for you.

715
02:42:27,473 --> 02:42:29,515
[SPEAKER_18]: Tonight we're going to talk just about substance abuse.

716
02:42:30,536 --> 02:42:40,292
[SPEAKER_18]: rates, and then I will come back, if I'm correct, Superintendent Belson, we discussed that I would come back, talk about risk and protective factors, and then come back again and talk about more data that we saw in the survey.

717
02:42:43,109 --> 02:42:51,254
[SPEAKER_18]: What I'm doing here by showing you this presentation is that I think that we need to remember that this is not a school problem.

718
02:42:51,434 --> 02:42:57,538
[SPEAKER_18]: This is a societal, family, peer-level, individual-level issue.

719
02:42:58,159 --> 02:43:05,564
[SPEAKER_18]: And to solve anything that we want to see change on these numbers, we really need to be working as a whole, as a team, to be able to do this.

720
02:43:06,605 --> 02:43:15,292
[SPEAKER_18]: The school over the years, I've been here since 2008, I began in September of 2008 doing this work, and the schools have had tremendous involvement.

721
02:43:15,552 --> 02:43:20,155
[SPEAKER_18]: The police department has had tremendous involvement in the work that we've done through the Board of Health.

722
02:43:21,657 --> 02:43:31,104
[SPEAKER_18]: And we put out many, many, many instances of putting information out to parents, and we have not had public forums where parents come out in droves, and that's not

723
02:43:32,425 --> 02:43:35,766
[SPEAKER_18]: that we wish they could get the information that we're putting out there.

724
02:43:35,806 --> 02:43:40,067
[SPEAKER_18]: So one of our urges here tonight is to say to parents, please pay attention.

725
02:43:40,107 --> 02:43:43,608
[SPEAKER_18]: We are doing prevention education for you.

726
02:43:43,708 --> 02:43:45,448
[SPEAKER_18]: We have resources for you.

727
02:43:45,848 --> 02:43:50,629
[SPEAKER_18]: We want to be thinking about substance use prevention long before someone uses substances.

728
02:43:51,089 --> 02:43:58,011
[SPEAKER_18]: We're fortunate now in the city of Method at the Board of Health to have an outreach worker, a recovery coach,

729
02:43:58,471 --> 02:44:04,092
[SPEAKER_18]: who will, you know, between the two of us, we sit and come up with a plan and work with individuals at the police department.

730
02:44:04,432 --> 02:44:19,536
[SPEAKER_18]: We do an early intervention program where if youth are found drinking or using drugs, we will bring them in for a three-hour education course, give them a screening to see if they themselves have any issues, and then we will speak directly to their families about getting them help.

731
02:44:19,876 --> 02:44:26,938
[SPEAKER_18]: Because we're really pushing that, you know, this is about getting help and getting this solved before it becomes a chronic issue for you and your family.

732
02:44:27,618 --> 02:44:31,264
[SPEAKER_18]: So, we have these resources available.

733
02:44:31,604 --> 02:44:37,132
[SPEAKER_18]: We are begging you to come out to our presentations and or access this information online.

734
02:44:38,274 --> 02:44:42,320
[SPEAKER_18]: Many programs for parents are going to be going up on the Mystic Valley Public Health

735
02:44:43,601 --> 02:44:45,102
[SPEAKER_18]: website coming up soon.

736
02:44:45,122 --> 02:44:50,528
[SPEAKER_18]: That will be linked to the City of Medford's website and hopefully to the school's website and to the police's website.

737
02:44:51,228 --> 02:45:00,277
[SPEAKER_18]: But today, if you have an issue, and this is a televised so I'm talking to the public, please go to drugfree.org and look for information there.

738
02:45:00,317 --> 02:45:02,419
[SPEAKER_18]: They can steer you in the right direction.

739
02:45:02,999 --> 02:45:08,583
[SPEAKER_18]: So, the survey itself, we're looking at three different measures of use rates.

740
02:45:08,683 --> 02:45:10,844
[SPEAKER_18]: We have lifetime use, so have you ever tried a substance?

741
02:45:11,305 --> 02:45:25,034
[SPEAKER_18]: Experimentation is something that happens, but use where it becomes a problem or can lead to a problem, we're looking at that at the 30-day prevalence use rate, so whether or not a student has used a substance within the last month, the last 30 days.

742
02:45:25,394 --> 02:45:27,075
[SPEAKER_18]: That's what we measure as current use.

743
02:45:28,662 --> 02:45:34,886
[SPEAKER_18]: And historically, we've always done this survey prior to the February vacation.

744
02:45:35,487 --> 02:45:41,170
[SPEAKER_18]: And this year, I believe in last year as well, the way that the schedule worked out, the survey was done after that time.

745
02:45:41,250 --> 02:45:46,154
[SPEAKER_18]: So that might be something to think about, but I don't see that reflected in the data at this point.

746
02:45:47,334 --> 02:45:53,258
[SPEAKER_18]: Binge drinking behavior is reported if five or more drinks in one sitting in the last two weeks.

747
02:45:53,879 --> 02:45:56,661
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's what we are measuring binge drinking behavior.

748
02:45:57,475 --> 02:46:02,499
[SPEAKER_18]: So the purpose of prevention is to delay use.

749
02:46:03,279 --> 02:46:06,442
[SPEAKER_18]: We want to drive those use numbers back.

750
02:46:06,582 --> 02:46:14,308
[SPEAKER_18]: We want to do our best to get the people who need help, help, and to reduce the amount of people that are trying, experimenting, and using frequently.

751
02:46:14,848 --> 02:46:21,073
[SPEAKER_18]: So what I have here to show you is I have multiple charts that will show you what's happened over time.

752
02:46:21,453 --> 02:46:23,455
[SPEAKER_18]: But this one here I think is really important.

753
02:46:23,875 --> 02:46:31,438
[SPEAKER_18]: So if you look at the youth substance use as a bell curve, you're going to have 5-10% of the students, they're never going to use substances.

754
02:46:31,738 --> 02:46:38,541
[SPEAKER_18]: They may have family history that causes them, they may have, you know, some school commitments or some religious commitments that prevent them from using.

755
02:46:38,961 --> 02:46:40,302
[SPEAKER_18]: And on the other end, you might have 5-10%.

756
02:46:41,602 --> 02:46:53,965
[SPEAKER_18]: percent of students who were going to use no matter what prevention measures were put into place because they have family history, they have trauma, they have other leading factors that could drive them towards something of that nature.

757
02:46:54,225 --> 02:47:05,228
[SPEAKER_18]: So what our goal is is really to drive the numbers back from, you know, we want as many people getting help and more towards that 5 to 10 percent of use as opposed to never using.

758
02:47:05,268 --> 02:47:07,889
[SPEAKER_18]: So in 2005, you can see here 71 percent of high school students

759
02:47:11,731 --> 02:47:17,101
[SPEAKER_18]: 71.2 percent of high school students said that they had used alcohol in their lifetime, ninth through twelfth graders.

760
02:47:17,121 --> 02:47:19,104
[SPEAKER_18]: This is both the high school and the vocational school.

761
02:47:19,585 --> 02:47:22,630
[SPEAKER_18]: In all of this case, those two schools are combined with the data.

762
02:47:23,849 --> 02:47:30,074
[SPEAKER_18]: In 2017, 45.8% of the students said that they had used alcohol in their lifetime.

763
02:47:30,934 --> 02:47:34,677
[SPEAKER_18]: This is a significant change in the rates.

764
02:47:35,197 --> 02:47:39,300
[SPEAKER_18]: And this is as a result of the teamwork that I talked about when I first started speaking.

765
02:47:39,701 --> 02:47:43,403
[SPEAKER_18]: So what we're doing is working, and we need to continue doing it.

766
02:47:43,804 --> 02:47:47,526
[SPEAKER_18]: And we need to continue to bring in more people into the fold and have this conversation.

767
02:47:49,378 --> 02:48:03,805
[SPEAKER_18]: This is 6th grade, and again, when we report out the data, I have both in your packet, lifetime and 30-day use, but current trends are really where you would see that there's sort of an issue that we would want to be addressing in the community.

768
02:48:04,165 --> 02:48:06,967
[SPEAKER_18]: That is where we would put more of our weight in the data.

769
02:48:07,387 --> 02:48:14,631
[SPEAKER_18]: So 6th to 8th grade, as you can see, over time, we've really brought these numbers down.

770
02:48:15,672 --> 02:48:17,854
[SPEAKER_18]: And you can, and these numbers are extremely low.

771
02:48:17,894 --> 02:48:24,740
[SPEAKER_18]: What you're looking at is, and all of you should have a chart provided with the actual percentages.

772
02:48:24,760 --> 02:48:28,083
[SPEAKER_18]: I like to do that because it's hard to read charts sometimes.

773
02:48:28,103 --> 02:48:34,890
[SPEAKER_18]: It would be on page six, maybe page actually five.

774
02:48:35,390 --> 02:48:37,993
[SPEAKER_18]: So for middle school students,

775
02:48:39,045 --> 02:48:41,106
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, 30-day use is 3.4%.

776
02:48:43,387 --> 02:48:46,168
[SPEAKER_18]: That's a lot lower than the national average.

777
02:48:46,228 --> 02:48:46,728
[SPEAKER_18]: For U.S.

778
02:48:46,808 --> 02:48:47,949
[SPEAKER_18]: norm, for 8th grade, it was 7.3%.

779
02:48:47,989 --> 02:48:49,929
[SPEAKER_18]: And I can tell you that our 8th graders were reporting

780
02:49:03,420 --> 02:49:04,241
[SPEAKER_18]: our eighth graders reporting 7.9%.

781
02:49:04,281 --> 02:49:07,603
[SPEAKER_18]: So we do want to be paying attention to that.

782
02:49:07,964 --> 02:49:09,485
[SPEAKER_18]: It's close to the national average.

783
02:49:10,225 --> 02:49:13,648
[SPEAKER_18]: It is a low number, thank goodness, but we should be talking about this.

784
02:49:13,688 --> 02:49:16,991
[SPEAKER_18]: This is why I'm saying we need to talk early and often.

785
02:49:17,351 --> 02:49:22,896
[SPEAKER_18]: We need to be prepared and we need to be ready to have those conversations.

786
02:49:22,916 --> 02:49:30,622
[SPEAKER_18]: We all should be talking to our friends' parents so they know what our personal preferences are and plans when they go to their houses, when they go to parties.

787
02:49:31,002 --> 02:49:34,587
[SPEAKER_18]: They go out to, you know, football games or whatever it is that everyone's well aware.

788
02:49:35,027 --> 02:49:37,250
[SPEAKER_18]: So we do see the numbers declining.

789
02:49:37,290 --> 02:49:38,912
[SPEAKER_18]: We always want to be monitoring the numbers.

790
02:49:39,493 --> 02:49:48,645
[SPEAKER_18]: In the high school, sorry, at the 9th through 12th grade level, we see the decline as well over time, and we're very pleased to see that.

791
02:49:51,517 --> 02:49:55,261
[SPEAKER_18]: One thing that we're monitoring this year that we've never monitored before is vaping.

792
02:49:55,941 --> 02:50:05,790
[SPEAKER_18]: So we don't have numbers to compare to the previous years, but what we can tell you is on page four,

793
02:50:12,443 --> 02:50:17,329
[SPEAKER_18]: What we know right now is that this is what the students reported in February of 2017.

794
02:50:17,489 --> 02:50:24,117
[SPEAKER_18]: Also remember, all 12th grade data, those students do not go to these school systems any longer.

795
02:50:24,157 --> 02:50:24,858
[SPEAKER_18]: They have moved on.

796
02:50:25,279 --> 02:50:27,221
[SPEAKER_18]: So that is something to be thinking about.

797
02:50:29,722 --> 02:50:33,525
[SPEAKER_18]: We believe that this number is going up exponentially as we speak.

798
02:50:33,966 --> 02:50:40,591
[SPEAKER_18]: Based on conversations amongst students and staff, there's a lot more concern for vaping.

799
02:50:40,951 --> 02:50:43,293
[SPEAKER_18]: And we need to be thinking about it overall.

800
02:50:44,014 --> 02:50:45,255
[SPEAKER_18]: So this is what vaping is.

801
02:50:46,016 --> 02:50:51,440
[SPEAKER_18]: This is the most popular vaping product that we're hearing about all over the state, really, right?

802
02:50:51,480 --> 02:50:52,241
[SPEAKER_18]: It's called Juul.

803
02:50:52,901 --> 02:50:54,042
[SPEAKER_18]: And it looks like a USB.

804
02:50:55,063 --> 02:51:00,131
[SPEAKER_18]: You can actually charge it by using it as a USB in your computer or wherever.

805
02:51:02,033 --> 02:51:05,078
[SPEAKER_18]: And one of those is equivalent to one pack of cigarettes.

806
02:51:06,340 --> 02:51:08,643
[SPEAKER_18]: The most popular product is a mango flavor.

807
02:51:10,410 --> 02:51:15,031
[SPEAKER_18]: Call me crazy, but I think they're marketing to a very specific population.

808
02:51:15,491 --> 02:51:23,172
[SPEAKER_18]: They have a very catchy name, and very catchy products, and anything flavored is gonna be really attractive to young people, right?

809
02:51:23,632 --> 02:51:32,414
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, the thing is about this, the other day we were talking about it, and I said, oh, don't worry, this is a patented product, you really, you know, they're not gonna be making marijuana products with this, right?

810
02:51:32,474 --> 02:51:33,034
[SPEAKER_18]: That's not true.

811
02:51:33,374 --> 02:51:37,675
[SPEAKER_18]: You can actually inject marijuana oil into this product once the,

812
02:51:38,115 --> 02:51:38,636
[SPEAKER_18]: stuff is out.

813
02:51:38,676 --> 02:51:44,901
[SPEAKER_18]: So you can get any, go on YouTube and you can learn anything you want to learn about how to hack this.

814
02:51:45,342 --> 02:51:52,388
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's discreet, so you could, somebody could be vaping in here right now and you may not notice.

815
02:51:53,129 --> 02:51:54,870
[SPEAKER_18]: It can be very discreet in that way.

816
02:51:55,671 --> 02:51:58,914
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's something that we really need to be paying attention to.

817
02:51:59,074 --> 02:51:59,935
[SPEAKER_18]: It's very covert.

818
02:52:00,735 --> 02:52:01,596
[SPEAKER_18]: Did you have something you want to say?

819
02:52:02,274 --> 02:52:14,631
[SPEAKER_26]: I heard that students are doing it in classrooms because it looks like just a USB and they also like can even exhale right into the hoodies and you don't even see anything.

820
02:52:14,691 --> 02:52:17,875
[SPEAKER_26]: So kids in class are actually, they call it drooling.

821
02:52:23,484 --> 02:52:31,010
[SPEAKER_18]: So the reality is that there's a lot of information and misinformation out there about vaping.

822
02:52:31,690 --> 02:52:36,754
[SPEAKER_18]: The main thing that you need to take away from this is that it contains nicotine and nicotine is one of the most

823
02:52:37,214 --> 02:52:40,035
[SPEAKER_18]: highly addicted drugs in the entire world, right?

824
02:52:40,416 --> 02:52:47,459
[SPEAKER_18]: So, um, you know, there may be speculation that, you know, they're vape, you know, that they're gonna get hooked on vaping and then they're gonna get hooked on cigarettes.

825
02:52:47,899 --> 02:52:52,701
[SPEAKER_18]: I argue that they're probably gonna be hooked on vaping for a very long time is really what the issue's gonna be.

826
02:52:53,282 --> 02:52:58,064
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, and we don't know, because there isn't long-term data to show what the effect of this will be.

827
02:52:58,424 --> 02:53:03,306
[SPEAKER_18]: Just like with cigarettes, we didn't know what cigarettes were gonna do to us, and now look at what we're, where we're at.

828
02:53:03,827 --> 02:53:03,987
[SPEAKER_18]: So,

829
02:53:05,087 --> 02:53:06,668
[SPEAKER_18]: We need to be cautious about that.

830
02:53:07,008 --> 02:53:12,531
[SPEAKER_18]: Now I want to show you this because this is a product that is also a vaping product.

831
02:53:12,911 --> 02:53:16,513
[SPEAKER_18]: They sell these inserts at dispensaries.

832
02:53:16,733 --> 02:53:27,158
[SPEAKER_18]: So if you see something like this, looks like an old timey cigarette holder, that can also be filled with a THC oil of some kind or something, some sort of marijuana derivative product.

833
02:53:28,470 --> 02:53:37,354
[SPEAKER_18]: So marijuana has become legalized in Massachusetts, and it's still dangerous for kids to use marijuana.

834
02:53:37,774 --> 02:53:44,917
[SPEAKER_18]: It can create long-term changes in the way that their brain responds to addictions.

835
02:53:45,097 --> 02:53:47,178
[SPEAKER_18]: It can do a number of different things.

836
02:53:47,839 --> 02:53:53,381
[SPEAKER_18]: What I want to show you in this slide is a very, very busy slide, but I put everything in one slide so that I didn't forget about a single thing.

837
02:53:55,162 --> 02:54:03,088
[SPEAKER_18]: Perception of harm, so great risk of harm, this is how our students said on the survey, that if you tried marijuana, you would be at great risk of harm.

838
02:54:03,349 --> 02:54:08,533
[SPEAKER_18]: There were other things, moderate risk, no risk, but this is specifically looking at the term great risk of harm.

839
02:54:08,973 --> 02:54:14,297
[SPEAKER_18]: So the good news is, is that there are a number of people who do think that you'd be at great risk of harm if you tried marijuana just once.

840
02:54:15,739 --> 02:54:23,084
[SPEAKER_18]: But then in some cases, you know, oddly, that smoking it regularly is somehow okay.

841
02:54:25,865 --> 02:54:31,672
[SPEAKER_18]: Great risk harm is a measure that if you look at, this is what, this is what the data shows nationally, right?

842
02:54:32,052 --> 02:54:35,136
[SPEAKER_18]: That if you believe it's harmful, you will use it less.

843
02:54:36,197 --> 02:54:43,145
[SPEAKER_18]: So what we want to do is make sure that people are well informed of this, of what these drugs and alcohol and everything can do to you.

844
02:54:44,987 --> 02:54:46,528
[SPEAKER_18]: But I feel like these numbers are pretty low.

845
02:54:47,068 --> 02:54:51,130
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that this is going to be an ongoing problem for a long time, and I'm going to tell you why.

846
02:54:51,450 --> 02:54:56,933
[SPEAKER_18]: Because it's very difficult to convey honest facts to young people about marijuana.

847
02:54:57,833 --> 02:55:04,636
[SPEAKER_18]: And we as a community really need to hunker down and think about how to present this information.

848
02:55:04,736 --> 02:55:06,297
[SPEAKER_18]: If we provide false facts

849
02:55:07,017 --> 02:55:10,858
[SPEAKER_18]: of scare tactics to young people, it will not change that number.

850
02:55:11,218 --> 02:55:21,342
[SPEAKER_18]: It'll probably make other things worse because then they'll know for a fact that you were lying to them about marijuana, maybe you're lying about cocaine, maybe you're lying about heroin or other opioids, right?

851
02:55:21,402 --> 02:55:26,964
[SPEAKER_18]: So what we want to do is figure out what is our game plan and to really work on that.

852
02:55:26,984 --> 02:55:33,526
[SPEAKER_18]: I know that there is some education in the curriculum, but I think that we can be doing more and we need to be thinking about this

853
02:55:34,935 --> 02:55:42,161
[SPEAKER_18]: a little bit more, I think that we as a state should have been thinking about this a little bit more all along the way and be prepared because this was going to happen.

854
02:55:42,761 --> 02:55:57,513
[SPEAKER_18]: So the other thing to be very aware of, which is startling to me even, even though I've seen it all, no I haven't really seen it all, but is that driving with someone under the influence of marijuana is pretty high in high school students.

855
02:55:59,269 --> 02:56:08,177
[SPEAKER_18]: So we know one thing for sure that Mothers Against Drunk Driving did a hell of a job of changing drinking and driving rates amongst young people.

856
02:56:08,617 --> 02:56:11,660
[SPEAKER_18]: But we also need to be thinking about this with marijuana as well.

857
02:56:12,120 --> 02:56:18,646
[SPEAKER_18]: It looks to me like almost 30 percent of high school seniors last year had driven in a car with someone under the influence of marijuana.

858
02:56:19,727 --> 02:56:24,271
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, and I think that classically people who smoke marijuana will go for a joy ride, right?

859
02:56:24,311 --> 02:56:25,032
[SPEAKER_18]: They hop in their car.

860
02:56:25,052 --> 02:56:26,353
[SPEAKER_18]: It's sort of a part of the culture.

861
02:56:26,926 --> 02:56:35,393
[SPEAKER_18]: is, you know, getting in your car and getting isolated, getting away from, you know, wherever, especially when you're a teenager because you don't have the freedom to smoke weed in your house or marijuana in your house.

862
02:56:35,433 --> 02:56:38,075
[SPEAKER_18]: So, um, we need to be paying attention to that.

863
02:56:38,316 --> 02:56:40,497
[SPEAKER_18]: We need to be paying very close attention to that, I think.

864
02:56:42,199 --> 02:56:44,361
[SPEAKER_18]: All in all, if you were to, um,

865
02:56:46,192 --> 02:56:52,737
[SPEAKER_18]: take a look at these marijuana rates, we are low in use rates.

866
02:56:52,797 --> 02:56:55,379
[SPEAKER_18]: We're lower than most of the country.

867
02:56:55,459 --> 02:57:01,583
[SPEAKER_18]: So I think that, you know, it's really interesting.

868
02:57:02,204 --> 02:57:04,025
[SPEAKER_18]: Let me just go back real quick.

869
02:57:04,225 --> 02:57:05,106
[SPEAKER_18]: Especially with high school.

870
02:57:06,041 --> 02:57:10,223
[SPEAKER_18]: So marijuana is, um, the gray line.

871
02:57:10,643 --> 02:57:15,565
[SPEAKER_18]: The third line down here starting on the left and then it goes up.

872
02:57:15,585 --> 02:57:21,827
[SPEAKER_18]: 2009-2013, which makes perfect sense because it's decriminalization, medical marijuana becomes legal, right?

873
02:57:21,847 --> 02:57:29,070
[SPEAKER_18]: So the perception of harm has definitely changed at that point, but at what, for some reason from 2013 into 2017 we're still seeing a decline

874
02:57:31,551 --> 02:57:33,752
[SPEAKER_18]: in that use, in that regular use of marijuana.

875
02:57:34,192 --> 02:57:43,614
[SPEAKER_18]: But what typically happens with marijuana use rates is there may be less people who start using marijuana, but the people who use marijuana use it far more chronically.

876
02:57:44,355 --> 02:57:45,655
[SPEAKER_18]: So they may use it more.

877
02:57:45,775 --> 02:57:47,876
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's something to also be thinking about.

878
02:57:52,591 --> 02:58:00,096
[SPEAKER_18]: And then finally, we get to the end of the presentation here, where we're doing a lot of things as a community.

879
02:58:00,236 --> 02:58:02,478
[SPEAKER_18]: I mentioned the youth diversion program.

880
02:58:03,339 --> 02:58:10,944
[SPEAKER_18]: I mentioned all the work that we've done over the years working with the school and the police, working on research, finding evidence-based practices.

881
02:58:11,544 --> 02:58:12,925
[SPEAKER_18]: That's what the city has done.

882
02:58:13,906 --> 02:58:16,708
[SPEAKER_18]: But we also have a grant called Partnerships for Success.

883
02:58:17,148 --> 02:58:20,311
[SPEAKER_18]: That's specifically focusing on prescription drug prevention.

884
02:58:21,291 --> 02:58:22,712
[SPEAKER_18]: Our numbers are very low.

885
02:58:23,152 --> 02:58:48,681
[SPEAKER_18]: If you go back to your charts, and you look at 30-day use rates, and even, well, I would say look at your lifetime rates of prescription drugs, you'll see that in 2005, for high school students, we had 11.4% of students reporting that they used prescription drugs without a doctor's prescription.

886
02:58:49,574 --> 02:58:53,516
[SPEAKER_18]: And you're looking at now, of all students ever having tried, 3.8%.

887
02:58:55,317 --> 02:59:03,840
[SPEAKER_18]: So regardless of the situation that's happening in our community with overdoses, we're seeing youth rates decline with opioid use.

888
02:59:05,201 --> 02:59:13,445
[SPEAKER_18]: I still see, you know, numbers declining with tranquilizers and then also stimulants are sort of leveled off from the previous year.

889
02:59:14,325 --> 02:59:20,552
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, our urge with our grant is to really say we need to be paying attention to all of these prescription drugs.

890
02:59:20,973 --> 02:59:25,939
[SPEAKER_18]: They all, um, cause, you know, can create an effect and cause a problem.

891
02:59:26,399 --> 02:59:28,742
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, opioids are clearly our biggest concern.

892
02:59:28,782 --> 02:59:29,903
[SPEAKER_18]: It's all over the news.

893
02:59:30,404 --> 02:59:33,708
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's a good thing because people are talking about it to their kids.

894
02:59:33,788 --> 02:59:34,809
[SPEAKER_18]: They're talking about,

895
02:59:35,149 --> 02:59:47,795
[SPEAKER_18]: what's going on with other family members maybe, um, my aunt lives in Indiana, she had crazy surgery and they were all over her prescription pain meds, so I was very pleased to hear that, not just in Massachusetts but other parts of the country.

896
02:59:48,195 --> 02:59:50,456
[SPEAKER_18]: Doctors are paying attention to those pain medications.

897
02:59:50,957 --> 02:59:55,379
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, but one thing is I went to Tufts last week and I did a training on, um,

898
02:59:56,099 --> 03:00:02,942
[SPEAKER_18]: how to use naloxone with Armstrong Ambulance, and I stated that cocaine is being cut with fentanyl on the street.

899
03:00:03,062 --> 03:00:04,742
[SPEAKER_18]: And I had a kid look up at me like, oh.

900
03:00:05,423 --> 03:00:07,944
[SPEAKER_18]: So I have, and I'm not saying that kid uses cocaine.

901
03:00:07,984 --> 03:00:15,266
[SPEAKER_18]: My point though being that people are unaware of this, and it's very important to know that we have to pay attention to all drug use.

902
03:00:15,406 --> 03:00:18,828
[SPEAKER_18]: It should not be about this drug is bad, this one isn't as bad.

903
03:00:19,368 --> 03:00:22,049
[SPEAKER_18]: All drugs are bad because, and alcohol too,

904
03:00:22,649 --> 03:00:27,292
[SPEAKER_18]: because it creates addiction and pathways to addiction then lead to further addiction problems.

905
03:00:28,052 --> 03:00:30,433
[SPEAKER_18]: So this is something that we just want to be aware of.

906
03:00:31,214 --> 03:00:36,356
[SPEAKER_18]: So anyhow, the Partnerships for Success grant, we have multiple projects that we're working with the school on.

907
03:00:36,876 --> 03:00:47,222
[SPEAKER_18]: One thing is a health and safety guide went out to all families from, I believe, 8th grade to 11th grade at the end of last year.

908
03:00:47,702 --> 03:00:58,925
[SPEAKER_18]: And it was a 24-page guide, multiple, multiple things to think about, where to dispose of drugs, what is vaping, you know, understanding stress in your students, prescription drugs.

909
03:00:59,045 --> 03:01:04,706
[SPEAKER_18]: It was a very well-organized litany of resources as well as information.

910
03:01:05,286 --> 03:01:08,987
[SPEAKER_18]: That's one way that we're trying to get information out to parents is direct mailing.

911
03:01:09,908 --> 03:01:15,369
[SPEAKER_18]: Another thing that we're doing that I think is really important is that we've helped through working with Rachel

912
03:01:15,749 --> 03:01:22,514
[SPEAKER_18]: We've implemented a module on prescription drugs into the 10th grade curriculum for the Michigan model.

913
03:01:23,354 --> 03:01:29,439
[SPEAKER_18]: And then we have a risk to resiliency professional development series where we're talking about trauma-informed care.

914
03:01:29,839 --> 03:01:32,061
[SPEAKER_18]: We're talking about absenteeism.

915
03:01:32,601 --> 03:01:37,945
[SPEAKER_18]: And really what we're trying to communicate is that we want to build these kids up.

916
03:01:38,485 --> 03:01:44,309
[SPEAKER_18]: If we just say that you're going to do drugs, you're going to do drugs, they might do drugs if you've told them that's who they are.

917
03:01:44,770 --> 03:01:53,956
[SPEAKER_18]: We're trying to really do the opposite of that and try to identify those sparks, those things that make individuals who they are and things that they can find sense of purpose.

918
03:01:54,056 --> 03:01:59,100
[SPEAKER_18]: Not our sense of purpose on these kids, but what is their sense of purpose so that they can have that.

919
03:01:59,480 --> 03:02:05,622
[SPEAKER_18]: driven internal, you know, guiding thing that keeps them in that 5 to 10% away from substances.

920
03:02:06,102 --> 03:02:09,123
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're working with faculty to get them that information.

921
03:02:09,143 --> 03:02:18,466
[SPEAKER_18]: So through the lens of asset building, the lens of looking at kids as though they have positive things to bring to this world, but understanding those risk factors.

922
03:02:18,486 --> 03:02:23,308
[SPEAKER_18]: And then finally, we're working with two identified faculty members.

923
03:02:23,428 --> 03:02:27,009
[SPEAKER_18]: One's a coach and one's also one's a academic.

924
03:02:27,409 --> 03:02:28,729
[SPEAKER_18]: after school club advisor.

925
03:02:29,110 --> 03:02:33,091
[SPEAKER_18]: And we're working with them to do training to all of the school clubs and advisors.

926
03:02:33,111 --> 03:02:36,552
[SPEAKER_18]: Because in the city of Method, that's where kids go after school in the high school.

927
03:02:36,592 --> 03:02:37,392
[SPEAKER_18]: They go to the clubs.

928
03:02:37,412 --> 03:02:38,233
[SPEAKER_18]: They go to sports.

929
03:02:38,573 --> 03:02:42,974
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're doing a integrated training with them around developmental relationships.

930
03:02:43,314 --> 03:02:46,316
[SPEAKER_18]: Just what I was saying, how do you identify those sparks in that kid?

931
03:02:46,616 --> 03:02:49,377
[SPEAKER_18]: You have these high, high achievers who are overstressed out.

932
03:02:49,677 --> 03:02:53,278
[SPEAKER_18]: And you have people who don't participate because the high, high achievers might be taken over.

933
03:02:53,558 --> 03:02:56,339
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're trying to talk about how do you balance that, how you facilitate your clubs.

934
03:02:56,679 --> 03:03:00,161
[SPEAKER_18]: How do you operate as a club advisor as opposed to a teacher in a classroom?

935
03:03:00,522 --> 03:03:03,323
[SPEAKER_18]: So those are our main programs that we're doing at the city.

936
03:03:03,343 --> 03:03:08,647
[SPEAKER_18]: And then I'm going to step back and let Rachel and Tony talk about the projects that they've done in the school.

937
03:03:09,867 --> 03:03:11,408
[SPEAKER_18]: And then I'll answer questions.

938
03:03:12,029 --> 03:03:12,489
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Penny.

939
03:03:12,509 --> 03:03:13,009
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

940
03:03:14,730 --> 03:03:15,151
[SPEAKER_16]: Good evening.

941
03:03:15,871 --> 03:03:18,012
[SPEAKER_16]: I wanted to talk a little bit about vaping.

942
03:03:18,533 --> 03:03:23,976
[SPEAKER_16]: Penny had talked about our numbers going down, but we have noticed we're seeing more and more of it here at the high school.

943
03:03:24,400 --> 03:03:25,260
[SPEAKER_16]: So we have addressed it.

944
03:03:26,441 --> 03:03:43,445
[SPEAKER_16]: One thing we have done is on November 21st, there was a meeting, a staff meeting that Nick Tucci actually presented information on vaping to our teachers, to our staff, presented what to look for, what the dangers are, and what they can do if they see a student actually vaping in class, what the steps are from there.

945
03:03:44,285 --> 03:03:47,946
[SPEAKER_16]: Tony has actually done some information out on our blog.

946
03:03:48,345 --> 03:03:49,006
[SPEAKER_16]: out to parents.

947
03:03:49,466 --> 03:03:51,228
[SPEAKER_16]: So that was out, I believe, was that October?

948
03:03:51,548 --> 03:03:52,349
[SPEAKER_16]: That was in October.

949
03:03:53,891 --> 03:03:58,835
[SPEAKER_16]: What we're working on right now is another message that goes out to all parents that will be going out in December.

950
03:04:00,898 --> 03:04:10,287
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Dempsey and Lisa Dunphy are also working on a video that students will be making and that will actually be presented as a homeroom activity in January.

951
03:04:10,347 --> 03:04:12,309
[SPEAKER_16]: So that will go out to all the students at the high school.

952
03:04:13,818 --> 03:04:23,772
[SPEAKER_16]: We have set up a presentation for February 8th for all parents, where it will be a vaping presentation along with In Plain Sight, which will be here again at the high school.

953
03:04:23,792 --> 03:04:29,360
[SPEAKER_16]: We had that at Seahall last year, but we thought it would be something that in light of everything that we could bring back.

954
03:04:31,156 --> 03:04:38,900
[SPEAKER_16]: And as part of our Michigan model curriculum, we've added vaping to any lesson that included tobacco.

955
03:04:39,020 --> 03:04:42,662
[SPEAKER_16]: So this is in the second year at the high school and the first year at the middle schools.

956
03:04:43,342 --> 03:04:51,686
[SPEAKER_16]: I did reach out to the principals at the middle schools and they really haven't seen much going on with vaping there, but we have seen the uptick here at the high school.

957
03:04:51,846 --> 03:04:53,447
[SPEAKER_28]: They know what to look for in the middle schools?

958
03:04:53,827 --> 03:04:54,788
[SPEAKER_16]: The teachers and?

959
03:04:55,028 --> 03:04:57,049
[SPEAKER_16]: That's something that we can actually present.

960
03:04:57,109 --> 03:04:59,010
[SPEAKER_16]: That would be the next step to bring it down to the middle school.

961
03:05:00,114 --> 03:05:00,454
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

962
03:05:01,915 --> 03:05:02,415
[SPEAKER_17]: Good evening.

963
03:05:02,715 --> 03:05:11,679
[SPEAKER_17]: I think some of the health services department activities we've talked about in the past, first being the SBIRT screening that we do in grade 9.

964
03:05:11,919 --> 03:05:13,940
[SPEAKER_17]: This year we're extending that to grade 7.

965
03:05:14,941 --> 03:05:23,865
[SPEAKER_17]: We're in the process of finishing all the training for the middle school staff so that we can start that after the turn of the year.

966
03:05:24,301 --> 03:05:26,742
[SPEAKER_17]: and our high school screening will start in January.

967
03:05:27,722 --> 03:05:47,147
[SPEAKER_17]: The other project the School Health Advisory Council has been involved in is we're reaching out to the community physicians, so we've met with the chief of pediatrics at Winchester Hospital, and we're looking to get onto the agenda for one of their Grand Rounds meetings, and we're going to be discussing ways that

968
03:05:47,979 --> 03:05:52,462
[SPEAKER_17]: We as school support staff can work and collaborate with the community physicians.

969
03:05:52,502 --> 03:06:01,387
[SPEAKER_17]: So we have better communication and we're, we each understand each other's models and we can be working on the same agendas.

970
03:06:02,208 --> 03:06:05,409
[SPEAKER_17]: So we're very pleased to be reaching out into the community for that.

971
03:06:08,711 --> 03:06:11,193
[SPEAKER_17]: I think everything else has been mentioned.

972
03:06:12,033 --> 03:06:16,516
[SPEAKER_17]: But our real goal is to get out education to parents and to faculty.

973
03:06:16,986 --> 03:06:18,808
[SPEAKER_17]: on this year about all these changes.

974
03:06:20,089 --> 03:06:26,196
[SPEAKER_25]: First of all, I just want to say thank you to all of you and everyone who's involved in this.

975
03:06:26,256 --> 03:06:30,961
[SPEAKER_25]: The educational piece in this is extremely important and the work that you've done has been extremely important.

976
03:06:31,382 --> 03:06:32,563
[SPEAKER_25]: So I want to say thank you for that.

977
03:06:32,863 --> 03:06:38,449
[SPEAKER_25]: But I do have some questions and as far as the survey, Penny, when the survey goes out,

978
03:06:39,730 --> 03:06:44,053
[SPEAKER_25]: Are there questions on the survey asking, like, when do they do this?

979
03:06:44,133 --> 03:06:44,874
[SPEAKER_25]: Is it weekends?

980
03:06:44,954 --> 03:06:47,656
[SPEAKER_25]: Is it, you know, after school, before school, during school?

981
03:06:48,736 --> 03:06:49,857
[SPEAKER_25]: Why are they doing it?

982
03:06:49,917 --> 03:06:53,540
[SPEAKER_25]: Are they doing it just as an experimental one-time thing?

983
03:06:53,600 --> 03:06:54,941
[SPEAKER_25]: Are they doing it because they're bored?

984
03:06:55,001 --> 03:06:56,822
[SPEAKER_25]: They're doing it because there's peer pressure?

985
03:06:58,423 --> 03:07:00,624
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, different questions like that.

986
03:07:00,684 --> 03:07:02,025
[SPEAKER_25]: Is there anything like that in the survey?

987
03:07:02,366 --> 03:07:04,007
[SPEAKER_18]: No, there's no questions like that.

988
03:07:04,427 --> 03:07:08,690
[SPEAKER_18]: But there are questions about where they get their alcohol, or their, I believe it's just alcohol.

989
03:07:09,190 --> 03:07:16,196
[SPEAKER_25]: But I do think it is important, but not that I'm saying that no matter when anyone uses anything like this, it's always important.

990
03:07:16,536 --> 03:07:20,479
[SPEAKER_25]: But I think if we could at least get a base on, well, gee, it's happening more on the weekends.

991
03:07:20,539 --> 03:07:21,700
[SPEAKER_25]: It's happening after school.

992
03:07:21,780 --> 03:07:26,123
[SPEAKER_25]: It's happening, you know, for our students that are busy.

993
03:07:26,584 --> 03:07:29,246
[SPEAKER_25]: Like, are they doing it more when it's not their season?

994
03:07:29,706 --> 03:07:34,270
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, are they doing it when it's not their hockey season or their soccer season or their football season?

995
03:07:34,890 --> 03:07:55,036
[SPEAKER_25]: Or is it, you know, for our drama students, and I'm not picking on clubs, I'm just saying as examples, you know, is it students that are always involved with a particular project that they're in or a team that they're on or a debate after school that kind of makes them think twice because they definitely know the repercussions of that.

996
03:07:56,816 --> 03:08:06,508
[SPEAKER_25]: For us, Paul, I think it would be very important to know, because if we could stop pinpointing where these, you know, stats go, okay, it's lower at this time, it's higher at this time.

997
03:08:06,628 --> 03:08:09,631
[SPEAKER_25]: Is it around, you know, is it around final exams?

998
03:08:09,772 --> 03:08:10,993
[SPEAKER_25]: Is it around MCAS?

999
03:08:11,394 --> 03:08:12,475
[SPEAKER_25]: Is it around the parks?

1000
03:08:12,755 --> 03:08:16,079
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, there's so many variables, and I think that

1001
03:08:17,040 --> 03:08:19,944
[SPEAKER_25]: We you have done this survey now for the last few years.

1002
03:08:20,645 --> 03:08:25,512
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, as a school committee member and as a parent, I think I would like to see it a little bit more expand.

1003
03:08:25,552 --> 03:08:33,202
[SPEAKER_25]: I know it's a lot more work, but to expand it to really see the pinpoint of where these students, you know, and why they're doing it.

1004
03:08:34,484 --> 03:08:37,727
[SPEAKER_25]: Sometimes there's no answers to those questions, and I totally understand that.

1005
03:08:38,829 --> 03:08:51,262
[SPEAKER_25]: The other thing I was going to ask you, too, is you had mentioned about, and I apologize if I used the wrong terminology, but like the interventions, if you find that there's like a group of students that are having a party.

1006
03:08:52,563 --> 03:08:55,565
[SPEAKER_25]: And then you bring them in for a three-hour workshop.

1007
03:08:56,986 --> 03:08:58,767
[SPEAKER_25]: Have we found those numbers to go up?

1008
03:08:58,987 --> 03:09:01,348
[SPEAKER_18]: No, those numbers are very low, actually.

1009
03:09:02,169 --> 03:09:10,934
[SPEAKER_18]: Our police officer, we've been doing this project since 2012, and it's been rolled out for about three years now.

1010
03:09:13,168 --> 03:09:14,108
[SPEAKER_18]: The numbers are very low.

1011
03:09:15,729 --> 03:09:23,190
[SPEAKER_18]: We just are not seeing very many kids in the park, not by we, I'm not a patrol officer, but the patrol officer is not seeing people out in the park very often.

1012
03:09:23,630 --> 03:09:33,253
[SPEAKER_18]: We've sent out youth cars specifically for that on high incident times and they're just not having as many of those calls coming in as they did in the years past.

1013
03:09:36,154 --> 03:09:39,476
[SPEAKER_18]: So I think that it's very interesting.

1014
03:09:39,536 --> 03:09:42,018
[SPEAKER_18]: So what I would say to you is this about those questions.

1015
03:09:42,038 --> 03:09:43,399
[SPEAKER_18]: I just want to answer that.

1016
03:09:43,839 --> 03:09:53,466
[SPEAKER_18]: This survey is a national survey, and the questions that are on there are vetted through research.

1017
03:09:53,926 --> 03:10:05,658
[SPEAKER_18]: So to add more questions on, this is already 200 questions for the students to sit and get through, which is far more extensive than the YRBS that others ask.

1018
03:10:05,698 --> 03:10:07,259
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're already asking a lot from these kids.

1019
03:10:07,619 --> 03:10:12,144
[SPEAKER_18]: But the other thing is that we can get some of that information just through a different method.

1020
03:10:12,184 --> 03:10:15,307
[SPEAKER_18]: We could use focus groups, key informant interviews.

1021
03:10:15,974 --> 03:10:21,900
[SPEAKER_18]: We would just need to find a way to get like a third party to come in, you know, and to do that and to set those up.

1022
03:10:21,960 --> 03:10:24,663
[SPEAKER_18]: So, for instance, I'm calling out to all the parents.

1023
03:10:24,723 --> 03:10:40,338
[SPEAKER_18]: If parents know that, you know, they want to know this information, they're willing to sign a permission slip, we have already have the means to start asking questions like this and getting qualitative data for us to find more out about when and where and how this is happening in the city.

1024
03:10:40,683 --> 03:10:42,143
[SPEAKER_25]: I just think it's really important.

1025
03:10:42,203 --> 03:10:46,365
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, I understand the national one because you do want to compare us to everyone else.

1026
03:10:47,085 --> 03:10:51,546
[SPEAKER_25]: The bottom line is also we want to make sure of what's happening in our own backyard.

1027
03:10:52,007 --> 03:10:59,169
[SPEAKER_25]: And I think that, you know, again, it's not forcing anyone to, you know, to answer these questions, but I think it's really important to know when

1028
03:10:59,989 --> 03:11:01,131
[SPEAKER_25]: and certain things are happening.

1029
03:11:01,812 --> 03:11:08,441
[SPEAKER_25]: And as far as to go back to, you know, kids hanging around the park, kids haven't been hanging around the park in a very long time.

1030
03:11:08,501 --> 03:11:10,283
[SPEAKER_25]: That doesn't really happen as much anymore.

1031
03:11:10,664 --> 03:11:13,427
[SPEAKER_25]: Years ago, parents allowed kids to hang around the park.

1032
03:11:13,768 --> 03:11:14,669
[SPEAKER_25]: Nowadays, they don't.

1033
03:11:15,330 --> 03:11:16,472
[SPEAKER_25]: But that doesn't mean that

1034
03:11:16,792 --> 03:11:18,735
[SPEAKER_25]: just because they're not things aren't happening.

1035
03:11:19,395 --> 03:11:33,273
[SPEAKER_25]: And I don't want to put blinders on and say that everybody's perfect and nothing's happening, but unfortunately we have seen, and I'm not saying it in the city of Method, and I'm not saying it doesn't happen in the city of Method, but unfortunately we have seen situations

1036
03:11:33,894 --> 03:11:51,010
[SPEAKER_25]: from you know it hits the media or whatever that well you know g parents think well my kids are gonna go out and drink anyway so why don't we all have them downstairs in the basement or g you know they're gonna be doing that anyway so why don't we have them you know here so just because they're not in a so-called park

1037
03:11:52,911 --> 03:12:09,538
[SPEAKER_25]: I still think that we have to have our ears and eyes open, and that's why I was saying, you know, if our administration, if our teachers hear anything about this big party going on or anything like that, you know, hey, you know, if the police officers happen to be around that area at that time,

1038
03:12:09,878 --> 03:12:12,900
[SPEAKER_25]: And it's not a get you, I have to get you type of thing.

1039
03:12:13,200 --> 03:12:18,242
[SPEAKER_25]: It's really to be more preventative before anything happens.

1040
03:12:18,282 --> 03:12:18,943
[SPEAKER_25]: That's all it is.

1041
03:12:19,623 --> 03:12:23,665
[SPEAKER_25]: And as far as the vaporing and the marijuana, I mean,

1042
03:12:26,346 --> 03:12:40,531
[SPEAKER_25]: My opinion is because now the legalization of it all, and I think that, you know, students and anyone who had the mentality before saying, oh, gee, it was marijuana that didn't want to touch it, now like, oh, it's marijuana because, like, we can't have it.

1043
03:12:40,911 --> 03:12:41,811
[SPEAKER_25]: And I've seen it.

1044
03:12:41,971 --> 03:12:43,432
[SPEAKER_25]: I've seen it this summer especially.

1045
03:12:43,872 --> 03:12:53,374
[SPEAKER_25]: I've seen it like, you know, people just, you know, smoking it, going down the street, and you have young children with you, and now young children are smelling it, and you're smelling it.

1046
03:12:53,815 --> 03:12:58,176
[SPEAKER_25]: And here we were years ago saying, you know, well, gee, do you know what, you know, secondhand smoking does?

1047
03:12:58,256 --> 03:13:04,577
[SPEAKER_25]: Now we have to explain to our kids, you know, well, gee, secondhand marijuana, inhaling it.

1048
03:13:04,677 --> 03:13:07,598
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, and it's a very, very concerning situation.

1049
03:13:08,278 --> 03:13:15,063
[SPEAKER_25]: I know that as a school system, we've been lucky enough to say, yes, we can ban it because we ban cigarettes.

1050
03:13:15,103 --> 03:13:16,664
[SPEAKER_25]: You're not allowed to do that.

1051
03:13:17,145 --> 03:13:26,271
[SPEAKER_25]: I just don't know if that number now is rising because students, you know, it's a new thing, you know, and I don't know if it's the mentality of it all and we could do it.

1052
03:13:26,311 --> 03:13:27,252
[SPEAKER_25]: It's not a big deal.

1053
03:13:27,312 --> 03:13:32,075
[SPEAKER_25]: It's not as bad as the cigarettes because we don't have anything out there yet to prove that.

1054
03:13:32,916 --> 03:13:35,218
[SPEAKER_25]: So I don't know if those numbers are going up because of it.

1055
03:13:37,593 --> 03:13:53,928
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I mean, I have a very extensive conversation with one of the classes here a couple months ago about vaping, about marijuana, and, you know, they were really practical.

1056
03:13:54,848 --> 03:13:56,009
[SPEAKER_18]: They want to know where the research is.

1057
03:13:57,219 --> 03:13:58,960
[SPEAKER_18]: They want to see the data.

1058
03:13:59,100 --> 03:14:05,863
[SPEAKER_18]: This is a good thing in many ways, because these are well-educated young people who are researching information on their own.

1059
03:14:06,224 --> 03:14:10,065
[SPEAKER_18]: On the same hand, you know, so they want to see it.

1060
03:14:10,186 --> 03:14:11,266
[SPEAKER_18]: And unfortunately, it's not there.

1061
03:14:11,326 --> 03:14:12,026
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not provided.

1062
03:14:12,107 --> 03:14:15,348
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're kind of, you know, but we had, I pushed them.

1063
03:14:15,408 --> 03:14:19,270
[SPEAKER_18]: I pushed them far and hard to think about this in a broader context.

1064
03:14:19,350 --> 03:14:21,511
[SPEAKER_18]: And we had a really rich discussion.

1065
03:14:22,232 --> 03:14:26,854
[SPEAKER_18]: And, you know, I think that there's tons of opportunity for us to have youth-led,

1066
03:14:27,575 --> 03:14:30,836
[SPEAKER_18]: initiatives that talk about vaping, that talk about marijuana use.

1067
03:14:30,876 --> 03:14:33,678
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that we can definitely be looking at that in the future.

1068
03:14:33,698 --> 03:14:36,179
[SPEAKER_18]: These are really brilliant kids in the school.

1069
03:14:36,619 --> 03:14:39,900
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'd be very interested to start doing that.

1070
03:14:39,920 --> 03:14:42,261
[SPEAKER_25]: Just two more questions real quick.

1071
03:14:42,281 --> 03:14:44,242
[SPEAKER_25]: One is to both Tony and Rachel.

1072
03:14:44,582 --> 03:14:48,344
[SPEAKER_25]: You were saying that you're speaking to our teachers more and more now about the vaping

1073
03:14:48,464 --> 03:14:50,886
[SPEAKER_25]: to be more aware of it, to be more cautious of it.

1074
03:14:50,906 --> 03:14:53,228
[SPEAKER_25]: And they know what the next steps are.

1075
03:14:53,288 --> 03:14:54,449
[SPEAKER_25]: But what do the students know?

1076
03:14:54,469 --> 03:14:55,890
[SPEAKER_25]: What are their next steps?

1077
03:14:55,950 --> 03:14:57,672
[SPEAKER_25]: If they're caught with it, what happens?

1078
03:14:59,574 --> 03:15:03,617
[SPEAKER_17]: The administration would follow the discipline codes that are in the handbook.

1079
03:15:03,657 --> 03:15:07,340
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's similar to using, God bless you, tobacco products.

1080
03:15:07,661 --> 03:15:11,424
[SPEAKER_17]: So they would follow those discipline codes.

1081
03:15:12,751 --> 03:15:21,175
[SPEAKER_25]: And I guess, Penny, the other thing is for you is I know that you've done a lot of outreach, but is there still any one-to-one on with the schools?

1082
03:15:21,215 --> 03:15:28,879
[SPEAKER_25]: Like when they have parent-teacher nights or if they're doing a special thing in their schools, is there anything going on that you have a table set up?

1083
03:15:29,600 --> 03:15:35,363
[SPEAKER_25]: Because I know it's difficult sometimes to get parents out because everyone is busy, but sometimes if they're there and it's

1084
03:15:36,403 --> 03:15:52,607
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't want to overtake another meeting, but I'm just saying that if you know that you're going to get a good crowd out there because of that meeting, is there something set up that night with your information, with someone out there to talk or maybe even have a five-minute, you know, discussion with the audience?

1085
03:15:53,427 --> 03:16:00,629
[SPEAKER_18]: So over the years, there's been, you know, a myriad of ways that I've been included in these types of events.

1086
03:16:01,089 --> 03:16:03,170
[SPEAKER_18]: I've had opportunities to speak before.

1087
03:16:04,176 --> 03:16:11,283
[SPEAKER_18]: The parent teacher night presentation begins at that table there.

1088
03:16:12,624 --> 03:16:20,212
[SPEAKER_18]: The best part about the City of Medford and the work that we've done here is that this community really takes on the work themselves.

1089
03:16:20,733 --> 03:16:25,258
[SPEAKER_18]: And so when high quality information is being put out, I don't need to be there.

1090
03:16:25,958 --> 03:16:28,599
[SPEAKER_18]: just to be a steward over it, it's being done.

1091
03:16:29,019 --> 03:16:39,784
[SPEAKER_18]: So all the stuff that happens for when DA Ryan comes and talks about social host liability, that's a tremendous program and that's happening on a regular yearly basis.

1092
03:16:39,804 --> 03:16:43,446
[SPEAKER_18]: So those are the kinds of things that we really, really shows how

1093
03:16:44,346 --> 03:16:46,508
[SPEAKER_18]: much effort is being put in by the school system.

1094
03:16:48,189 --> 03:17:01,178
[SPEAKER_18]: Last year we had Dr. Ruth Cody come and do a presentation as a partnership and there were 75 people there but the majority were faculty and other people that work in school systems throughout the region.

1095
03:17:01,578 --> 03:17:04,901
[SPEAKER_18]: So again you know the first time we ever had a presentation here it was

1096
03:17:05,901 --> 03:17:09,983
[SPEAKER_18]: Be a parent, not a pal, social host liability, just like the DAs.

1097
03:17:10,383 --> 03:17:13,024
[SPEAKER_18]: There were three people that showed up.

1098
03:17:13,404 --> 03:17:17,526
[SPEAKER_18]: And there was 2,400 mail outs that went out advertising this program.

1099
03:17:17,806 --> 03:17:28,490
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's just like, it's nice to see when people do come and we get to talk to them and they see that, you know, we're not, but really what happens is when we do a community table, I want to be completely honest with you.

1100
03:17:29,090 --> 03:17:39,856
[SPEAKER_18]: This is very scary to people to talk about substance abuse when you're talking about, you know, a 7th grade kid or even a 7 year old or even a high school kid who you've never seen have an issue with it.

1101
03:17:40,977 --> 03:17:42,177
[SPEAKER_18]: They do not want to talk to it.

1102
03:17:42,217 --> 03:17:46,720
[SPEAKER_18]: That's why we're called Team Medford, not the Substance Abuse People, because people just don't want to talk about it.

1103
03:17:47,040 --> 03:17:55,806
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's very rare that you get a good, you know, showing out at your table at the community tabling events, but it is worth it.

1104
03:17:55,826 --> 03:17:59,128
[SPEAKER_18]: We do often have a really good conversation with at least one person.

1105
03:17:59,548 --> 03:18:03,991
[SPEAKER_18]: So yes, I mean, we go to as many as we can and we'll continue to do that.

1106
03:18:04,011 --> 03:18:09,394
[SPEAKER_18]: But I'd like to see where it's actually an institutionalized conversation.

1107
03:18:09,787 --> 03:18:13,813
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not just like, oh, the substance abuse people are coming and walking in and they're going to tell you some information.

1108
03:18:14,154 --> 03:18:21,485
[SPEAKER_18]: It's nice when we're coming and we're asked to be experts, but it's really a part of the growth of an individual to be talking about this.

1109
03:18:21,566 --> 03:18:23,889
[SPEAKER_18]: So I think that it should be sort of embedded in everything.

1110
03:18:25,411 --> 03:18:35,642
[SPEAKER_25]: I know having you come in just by yourselves, even though you have a great program, it's just as you mentioned, it's scary sometimes, and people don't want to hear it sometimes.

1111
03:18:36,043 --> 03:18:40,628
[SPEAKER_25]: So this way here, instead of having it directly, that's why I was saying if there was some collaboration.

1112
03:18:40,988 --> 03:18:41,968
[SPEAKER_25]: And I know that you've had it.

1113
03:18:41,988 --> 03:18:44,449
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, and I know that they've had it.

1114
03:18:44,509 --> 03:19:02,214
[SPEAKER_25]: I just, for people that are watching that don't know about it, you know, and maybe they don't feel comfortable calling you, but they might feel comfortable calling a principal or a teacher or, you know, or a child listening, you know, happens to listen to this and asks another, you know, another student, at least they know that, gee,

1115
03:19:02,634 --> 03:19:05,175
[SPEAKER_25]: They don't have to necessarily call you directly.

1116
03:19:05,195 --> 03:19:08,296
[SPEAKER_25]: They can go to someone because they know that you're all working together.

1117
03:19:08,356 --> 03:19:08,936
[SPEAKER_18]: Absolutely.

1118
03:19:08,976 --> 03:19:09,877
[SPEAKER_18]: That's absolutely true.

1119
03:19:10,237 --> 03:19:16,019
[SPEAKER_18]: And one of the biggest things for their buck in the college setting is how to help a friend.

1120
03:19:16,759 --> 03:19:21,901
[SPEAKER_18]: And we worked with a student last year to put up posters that were about how to help a friend.

1121
03:19:21,961 --> 03:19:23,462
[SPEAKER_18]: And so they're advertised to the kids.

1122
03:19:24,782 --> 03:19:30,686
[SPEAKER_18]: about how do you get resources for your friends, and they're up, but again, do they see them?

1123
03:19:30,746 --> 03:19:37,370
[SPEAKER_18]: Unless we paid a million dollars to have a Snapchat story commercial, I don't know if anyone's ever going to see it, let's be honest.

1124
03:19:37,470 --> 03:19:38,250
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. Benedetto.

1125
03:19:38,290 --> 03:19:43,553
[SPEAKER_26]: Do we have a vaping policy on the books or are we using the tobacco policy?

1126
03:19:50,658 --> 03:20:00,045
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're using the tobacco policy because vaping is sort of a derivative and you know but as we move forward we'll obviously specify a little bit more completely.

1127
03:20:00,245 --> 03:20:15,496
[SPEAKER_26]: Well with the growth I see throughout not just our community but socially and adults as well as high school age students I would like for this committee to start working on that so that way it's in our handbooks as vaping

1128
03:20:16,036 --> 03:20:44,397
[SPEAKER_26]: as jeweling, as the correct terminology, so students are very clear how we as adults feel in this community about this, because students just do not believe, they think that, oh, I quit smoking, I'm only vaping now, and that's what you hear, and they don't realize when it gets in their lungs, it's like popcorn, and it blows up their lungs, and it does all these health implications, and there's not a lot of data because they haven't been doing it for years, but having,

1129
03:20:45,478 --> 03:20:51,162
[SPEAKER_26]: Two people in my house who read this report before I got here, almost 27 and almost 25.

1130
03:20:51,242 --> 03:20:58,488
[SPEAKER_26]: One's a future NP and one works in another community on these exact programs.

1131
03:20:58,968 --> 03:21:00,949
[SPEAKER_26]: They were happy to see our numbers.

1132
03:21:01,730 --> 03:21:03,751
[SPEAKER_26]: that we're doing a great job in MedFed.

1133
03:21:04,352 --> 03:21:13,278
[SPEAKER_26]: We want to be clear, call it what it is, name it, say it's not okay, and tell them that from day one, so that way the wording is correct.

1134
03:21:13,298 --> 03:21:16,700
[SPEAKER_26]: Because once you name something, it's not like this secret thing anymore.

1135
03:21:17,241 --> 03:21:17,861
[SPEAKER_26]: It's not as fun.

1136
03:21:19,022 --> 03:21:23,203
[SPEAKER_26]: So that's a motion on on the floor and I need a second second my colleagues.

1137
03:21:24,143 --> 03:21:30,684
[SPEAKER_26]: I'd like to see this in place and in every handbook at every at our junior high and high school level by next year.

1138
03:21:31,504 --> 03:21:39,065
[SPEAKER_26]: So that parents know that this is happening in our community and that we're taking it seriously and we're not going to we're not going to continue.

1139
03:21:39,826 --> 03:21:40,686
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you very much.

1140
03:21:40,706 --> 03:21:41,866
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. Van der Kloot.

1141
03:21:42,146 --> 03:21:47,747
[SPEAKER_21]: Honey last spring I was able to attend and I don't remember the title of it but the night of remembrance.

1142
03:21:48,908 --> 03:21:54,350
[SPEAKER_21]: for those who had died of opiate deaths, related deaths.

1143
03:21:54,950 --> 03:22:00,251
[SPEAKER_21]: And one of the things, and it was a very powerful presentation, but there were two speakers that particularly impacted me.

1144
03:22:00,631 --> 03:22:04,052
[SPEAKER_21]: They were both students who had previously attended Medford High.

1145
03:22:05,252 --> 03:22:10,434
[SPEAKER_21]: And one of the things that they said was, they both said they actually were pretty good kids here.

1146
03:22:12,114 --> 03:22:21,424
[SPEAKER_21]: you know, were popular, they were, you know, kids who were not involved, particularly with drugs or alcohol at that time.

1147
03:22:22,965 --> 03:22:28,611
[SPEAKER_21]: And one of my biggest concerns is, I think we're doing good work laying a positive

1148
03:22:29,432 --> 03:22:50,093
[SPEAKER_21]: foundation here but I'm totally worried about that transition off topology and um I'm not sure I'm you just mentioned some posters how to help a friend and you know we see these uh incredible stories of you know the frat brothers who you know are drinking too much and then let their frat brother die um you know and that's that's where I'm wondering our last

1149
03:22:51,654 --> 03:22:53,375
[SPEAKER_21]: We're touching the kids at 10th grade.

1150
03:22:54,236 --> 03:23:00,439
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know whether we're discussing at that point, hey, when you get to college, these are things to expect, you know.

1151
03:23:01,520 --> 03:23:05,742
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm just concerned about that transition to college and loneliness, too.

1152
03:23:06,322 --> 03:23:11,505
[SPEAKER_21]: For some kids, when they go off, we put so much, hey, we're going to college, and then all of a sudden they get there, and it's kind of a little lonely sometimes.

1153
03:23:12,345 --> 03:23:14,206
[SPEAKER_16]: So we do touch upon that in 10th grade.

1154
03:23:14,406 --> 03:23:20,630
[SPEAKER_16]: Last year we actually had Armstrong Ambulance come in and they did a training for all of our seniors going off to college.

1155
03:23:21,010 --> 03:23:24,532
[SPEAKER_16]: They talked about, you know, drugs, drug use, overdoses.

1156
03:23:25,033 --> 03:23:27,374
[SPEAKER_16]: They learned how to do CPR, first aid.

1157
03:23:28,775 --> 03:23:34,458
[SPEAKER_16]: So that was actually something that we started last year to help those students transitioning from senior year into college.

1158
03:23:35,896 --> 03:23:41,338
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, also, I just wondered that those two speakers who were there that night, um, have they come and spoken?

1159
03:23:41,438 --> 03:23:47,020
[SPEAKER_21]: I know that they both expressed willingness to me or to others, uh, to come and talk directly to students.

1160
03:23:47,580 --> 03:23:52,782
[SPEAKER_21]: And I've wondered if, um, I haven't gotten anything.

1161
03:23:52,822 --> 03:23:56,283
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm sure you have the names and they certainly expressed their willingness to me.

1162
03:23:56,323 --> 03:23:59,244
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think that we might, um, it might be valuable.

1163
03:24:00,885 --> 03:24:03,386
[SPEAKER_18]: I apologize for not including the, um,

1164
03:24:04,372 --> 03:24:07,714
[SPEAKER_18]: naloxone training to seniors and also to our vocational students.

1165
03:24:09,495 --> 03:24:11,836
[SPEAKER_18]: We do a lot of stuff.

1166
03:24:12,356 --> 03:24:20,660
[SPEAKER_18]: That's a big one though because it does start to talk about this missing population, 18 to 28 year olds I would say.

1167
03:24:20,680 --> 03:24:23,121
[SPEAKER_18]: You know one of the things that we're doing that's

1168
03:24:24,822 --> 03:24:26,644
[SPEAKER_18]: Really a big cornerstone in our offices.

1169
03:24:26,684 --> 03:24:39,738
[SPEAKER_18]: We're doing a lot of work working with trying to address overdose rates in the trades and so we've worked with Heidi had last year did a great job of getting us in and we had that and

1170
03:24:40,038 --> 03:24:40,798
[SPEAKER_18]: that conversation.

1171
03:24:40,818 --> 03:24:44,259
[SPEAKER_18]: So we talked about, you know, dangers on the job.

1172
03:24:44,299 --> 03:24:54,222
[SPEAKER_18]: We met with all the vocational students that were in co-op and we talked about, you know, injuries on the job, what to do if there's an injury from a tourniquet to how to use naloxone.

1173
03:24:54,883 --> 03:24:59,684
[SPEAKER_18]: And we had a really great conversation, super bright nursing, you know, CNA students and

1174
03:25:00,124 --> 03:25:02,005
[SPEAKER_18]: Just really really good conversations there.

1175
03:25:02,025 --> 03:25:12,189
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's one way that we should be thinking about and continuing to partner about you know working with those employers who are Taking on our students and what are they're doing?

1176
03:25:12,209 --> 03:25:13,209
[SPEAKER_18]: What are their practices?

1177
03:25:13,249 --> 03:25:15,230
[SPEAKER_18]: We've created a toolkit for workers on a

1178
03:25:15,590 --> 03:25:19,892
[SPEAKER_18]: how to understand the laws that pertain to them as well as to their employees.

1179
03:25:20,192 --> 03:25:21,752
[SPEAKER_18]: So we've done a lot of work around that.

1180
03:25:22,252 --> 03:25:24,693
[SPEAKER_18]: That gets at the population that's not going off to college.

1181
03:25:25,053 --> 03:25:32,976
[SPEAKER_18]: But I think that one thing that Danielle from Armstrong Ambulance would say is that the majority of the students were staying in Massachusetts.

1182
03:25:33,457 --> 03:25:43,000
[SPEAKER_18]: And so it's really about all of us thinking, all of our school systems thinking as a whole about how to teach kids the same information across the board.

1183
03:25:43,325 --> 03:25:46,586
[SPEAKER_18]: So when they do go to school, they're still taking care of each other and helping each other out.

1184
03:25:47,186 --> 03:25:47,946
[SPEAKER_26]: Mr. Benedetto.

1185
03:25:48,806 --> 03:25:56,028
[SPEAKER_26]: So when you're doing that training this year for CPI or first aid, can we add back in training that's already in it?

1186
03:25:56,148 --> 03:25:57,708
[SPEAKER_17]: It's already there.

1187
03:25:58,069 --> 03:26:01,449
[SPEAKER_26]: And is that for both the high school and the vocational seniors?

1188
03:26:01,829 --> 03:26:03,170
[SPEAKER_26]: So so that's great.

1189
03:26:03,310 --> 03:26:04,110
[SPEAKER_26]: I think that's wonderful.

1190
03:26:04,810 --> 03:26:07,291
[SPEAKER_26]: And I think Mr. Turgali.

1191
03:26:07,791 --> 03:26:12,372
[SPEAKER_43]: Yeah, I think that the so in in the school, I think that the reason that

1192
03:26:12,870 --> 03:26:24,193
[SPEAKER_43]: as you stated many times, the reason that people do dueling so much is just because they think it's not bad and also that it seems clean and they don't think that it's hurtful.

1193
03:26:24,773 --> 03:26:29,774
[SPEAKER_43]: One thing that I think would be really effective, similar to the 74% of

1194
03:26:32,481 --> 03:26:34,704
[SPEAKER_43]: Medford students are marijuana free.

1195
03:26:35,746 --> 03:26:39,350
[SPEAKER_43]: I thought that was really effective just having the facts up there.

1196
03:26:39,771 --> 03:26:43,315
[SPEAKER_43]: So I think like something that could be really effective in the school

1197
03:26:44,969 --> 03:27:04,344
[SPEAKER_43]: you know, like maybe picking three or four facts, um, from, you know, like one Juul pod contains as much nicotine as a pack of cigarettes, um, you'd be surprised how many people, uh, pay attention to that, and especially, as you mentioned, um, that, you know, the, the facts are not out there, and people would be really, um,

1198
03:27:05,512 --> 03:27:13,959
[SPEAKER_43]: You know, it would change the perception of the problem at hand before it really takes root over time.

1199
03:27:14,600 --> 03:27:15,500
[SPEAKER_43]: So, yeah.

1200
03:27:15,761 --> 03:27:18,983
[SPEAKER_18]: That's called social norming, and you just identified as scientific.

1201
03:27:20,382 --> 03:27:22,423
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, research, study, evidence-based, but it works.

1202
03:27:22,463 --> 03:27:30,927
[SPEAKER_18]: And we have done posters in the past that we believe could have driven those numbers continually down, talking about how many students actually don't use marijuana.

1203
03:27:31,327 --> 03:27:36,930
[SPEAKER_18]: It's interesting when you are someone who's using substances, your peer group's probably using substances.

1204
03:27:37,030 --> 03:27:39,591
[SPEAKER_18]: That's the whole entire world is using substances.

1205
03:27:40,011 --> 03:27:41,752
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's something to be thinking about.

1206
03:27:41,792 --> 03:27:47,275
[SPEAKER_18]: It's really important to get the facts out there and to really show that there's a lot of kids who just don't do this stuff, a lot of students.

1207
03:27:49,158 --> 03:27:50,419
[SPEAKER_03]: can you yield to Miss O'Brien?

1208
03:27:50,479 --> 03:27:50,679
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

1209
03:27:51,080 --> 03:27:51,740
[SPEAKER_03]: Miss O'Brien.

1210
03:27:51,800 --> 03:27:57,305
[SPEAKER_03]: So back when I was in high school, I was part of the Above the Influence Club for a while with Miss Perry as my advisor.

1211
03:27:57,565 --> 03:28:00,928
[SPEAKER_03]: And we had Chris Heron come and speak to all the athletes in high school.

1212
03:28:01,269 --> 03:28:01,989
[SPEAKER_03]: It was mandatory.

1213
03:28:02,029 --> 03:28:05,913
[SPEAKER_03]: You couldn't even play the spring sport unless you went and saw Chris Heron.

1214
03:28:06,053 --> 03:28:16,082
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that was such a positive thing for us as high schoolers to see someone who's young and who overcame something and made something of his life, who

1215
03:28:16,562 --> 03:28:19,303
[SPEAKER_03]: was rich at one point and then totally went somewhere else.

1216
03:28:19,363 --> 03:28:28,024
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel like that would be so beneficial to have a motivational speaker come in, not even just the athletes, but to everyone in the school should have the opportunity to come see someone.

1217
03:28:28,465 --> 03:28:30,905
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's not just the athletes that fall out of track, you know?

1218
03:28:31,225 --> 03:28:31,785
[SPEAKER_03]: It's everyone.

1219
03:28:31,925 --> 03:28:34,466
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think a motivational speaker would be totally helpful.

1220
03:28:34,486 --> 03:28:39,247
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Chris Herron, I know, like my friends, when we left, we were like, oh my gosh, like wow.

1221
03:28:39,987 --> 03:28:44,070
[SPEAKER_03]: I know Mary Burke's daughter was on the lacrosse team with me and she, it was just amazing.

1222
03:28:44,110 --> 03:28:51,695
[SPEAKER_03]: It was an amazing experience and I think the children would really benefit from that and I think we should not even open it to just the high school, it should be the middle school too.

1223
03:28:51,795 --> 03:28:52,116
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.

1224
03:28:52,656 --> 03:29:01,242
[SPEAKER_03]: And me being a young teacher and wanting to teach in Medford, I think we have such a strong community and we're so tight bonded and I'm so tight bonded with everyone in the community.

1225
03:29:01,262 --> 03:29:03,544
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like I can talk to anyone here and I want to be able to

1226
03:29:05,078 --> 03:29:10,880
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how to put it, but have people be able to come and talk to the teachers and be comfortable with everyone.

1227
03:29:11,220 --> 03:29:14,901
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think a motivational speaker coming in would be just a great aspect.

1228
03:29:14,941 --> 03:29:15,641
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how Ms.

1229
03:29:15,661 --> 03:29:16,901
[SPEAKER_03]: Carey got Chris Hirons.

1230
03:29:16,922 --> 03:29:21,683
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe she could come about that again, but I know he does motivational speaking all the time.

1231
03:29:21,723 --> 03:29:22,483
[SPEAKER_03]: I follow him on Twitter.

1232
03:29:22,503 --> 03:29:23,403
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he's amazing.

1233
03:29:24,084 --> 03:29:24,704
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah.

1234
03:29:25,384 --> 03:29:26,784
[SPEAKER_03]: Great recommendation, Hannah.

1235
03:29:28,165 --> 03:29:28,705
[SPEAKER_28]: Mr. Carey.

1236
03:29:29,313 --> 03:29:34,301
[SPEAKER_27]: May I throw you to Sebastian, this is your next great story, your next great lead in the Mustang News.

1237
03:29:34,862 --> 03:29:39,369
[SPEAKER_27]: It's their posters, you know, get it in print and shoot for our Pulitzer.

1238
03:29:41,312 --> 03:29:55,697
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that one in our report that one stat about one jewel can have whatever it was contains as much nicotine as a pack of cigarettes.

1239
03:29:55,917 --> 03:29:59,398
[SPEAKER_21]: It's just so striking that it is time for us.

1240
03:29:59,438 --> 03:30:00,699
[SPEAKER_21]: We have a graphics arts department.

1241
03:30:00,739 --> 03:30:02,280
[SPEAKER_21]: We can get some posters made up.

1242
03:30:03,000 --> 03:30:05,981
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that that would be incredibly valuable to right away get out.

1243
03:30:06,221 --> 03:30:11,804
[SPEAKER_18]: I think you should also know that one of those pods is like $4, like four or five bucks.

1244
03:30:12,765 --> 03:30:15,406
[SPEAKER_18]: So a lot cheaper than a pack.

1245
03:30:15,426 --> 03:30:18,268
[SPEAKER_28]: No taxes, or is it a tax on that stuff?

1246
03:30:18,368 --> 03:30:19,028
[SPEAKER_28]: No, it's online.

1247
03:30:19,088 --> 03:30:20,769
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't know if it's taxed.

1248
03:30:21,130 --> 03:30:22,350
[SPEAKER_28]: It's sales tax.

1249
03:30:22,670 --> 03:30:26,353
[SPEAKER_28]: So our community, the Board of Health passed that you cannot sell to minors.

1250
03:30:26,393 --> 03:30:26,613
[SPEAKER_28]: Right.

1251
03:30:26,653 --> 03:30:27,013
[SPEAKER_28]: God bless you.

1252
03:30:27,033 --> 03:30:27,473
[SPEAKER_28]: God bless you.

1253
03:30:28,814 --> 03:30:30,355
[SPEAKER_27]: I think that's a good point.

1254
03:30:30,375 --> 03:30:31,655
[SPEAKER_27]: And just one last point for Sebastian.

1255
03:30:31,695 --> 03:30:32,836
[SPEAKER_28]: There was information.

1256
03:30:32,876 --> 03:30:42,181
[SPEAKER_27]: There was a great article a couple of weeks ago on the globe regarding dueling and its effects and what they know so far, so you might want to research that.

1257
03:30:42,201 --> 03:30:46,243
[SPEAKER_27]: Come up with your own conclusions and get a story out there for us.

1258
03:30:46,423 --> 03:30:46,803
[SPEAKER_27]: That's good.

1259
03:30:46,823 --> 03:30:47,463
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1260
03:30:47,483 --> 03:30:48,144
[SPEAKER_21]: Miss Van der Kloot.

1261
03:30:48,284 --> 03:30:48,484
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

1262
03:30:48,544 --> 03:30:52,846
[SPEAKER_21]: No, I just wondered if we can also I don't know whether I should make it as a form of a motion, but maybe we could

1263
03:30:58,194 --> 03:30:59,575
[SPEAKER_28]: Motion on the fly second.

1264
03:31:00,736 --> 03:31:04,059
[SPEAKER_28]: On the motions that have been offered thus far, all those in favor?

1265
03:31:04,220 --> 03:31:04,740
[SPEAKER_24]: Aye.

1266
03:31:04,840 --> 03:31:05,601
[SPEAKER_28]: All those opposed?

1267
03:31:06,041 --> 03:31:08,944
[SPEAKER_28]: Motion passes, including a motivational speaker.

1268
03:31:12,366 --> 03:31:15,628
[SPEAKER_28]: Mr. Ruggiero, school committee man-elect.

1269
03:31:16,828 --> 03:31:17,608
[SPEAKER_14]: I have two questions.

1270
03:31:18,549 --> 03:31:29,454
[SPEAKER_14]: The first is so the alcohol use from the 6th to 8th grade dropped pretty precipitously from 2011 to 2013 and I was wondering what accounts for that drop.

1271
03:31:30,034 --> 03:31:33,456
[SPEAKER_14]: And the second thing I had is maybe just helping us understand the analytics.

1272
03:31:33,476 --> 03:31:35,897
[SPEAKER_14]: So you have children completing a survey

1273
03:31:37,450 --> 03:31:46,792
[SPEAKER_14]: Do we have any sense of how many people are actually users but are concerned that if they fill out this survey and profit with this information will be seen by a teacher that they're handing it in?

1274
03:31:47,592 --> 03:31:49,333
[SPEAKER_14]: Do we have like a sense of like heroin use?

1275
03:31:49,373 --> 03:31:52,393
[SPEAKER_14]: I know overdose is a serious issue in Medford.

1276
03:31:52,613 --> 03:31:57,194
[SPEAKER_14]: So do we have a sense of underage heroin overdoses in Medford?

1277
03:31:57,354 --> 03:31:59,775
[SPEAKER_18]: There are no underage heroin overdoses in Medford.

1278
03:32:01,275 --> 03:32:04,436
[SPEAKER_18]: There was an individual who's 19 that overdosed and

1279
03:32:05,054 --> 03:32:06,855
[SPEAKER_18]: died in Medford, they were from another community.

1280
03:32:06,955 --> 03:32:07,876
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's something to know.

1281
03:32:11,698 --> 03:32:13,579
[SPEAKER_18]: So I have it here at the bottom.

1282
03:32:13,679 --> 03:32:25,747
[SPEAKER_18]: But these numbers are so small that it's very, you have to really think about that, that this is like .1% of the entire population that took it reported.

1283
03:32:25,767 --> 03:32:26,827
[SPEAKER_18]: That could be one student.

1284
03:32:27,388 --> 03:32:29,569
[SPEAKER_18]: So there's something to think about when you're looking at that data.

1285
03:32:30,049 --> 03:32:30,630
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's there.

1286
03:32:31,891 --> 03:32:33,732
[SPEAKER_18]: But your question is about,

1287
03:32:35,276 --> 03:32:37,637
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, what was the drop?

1288
03:32:37,937 --> 03:32:39,337
[SPEAKER_14]: The drop was pretty significant.

1289
03:32:39,377 --> 03:32:42,018
[SPEAKER_14]: If you have 10%, that's a significant selection.

1290
03:32:42,038 --> 03:32:42,619
[SPEAKER_18]: It is a significant drop.

1291
03:32:42,659 --> 03:32:47,560
[SPEAKER_18]: And what we saw at that time was we saw an increase in parental monitoring.

1292
03:32:48,541 --> 03:32:57,664
[SPEAKER_18]: If you were to look at the risk and protective factors, we talked about in 2011, there were some protective factors that were very low in the middle schools.

1293
03:32:58,044 --> 03:33:02,549
[SPEAKER_18]: And by the next year, they were exactly even with their sister scores.

1294
03:33:03,309 --> 03:33:14,020
[SPEAKER_18]: So the deal was is that there were many opportunities for rewards if you do something in the school, but there weren't very many opportunities.

1295
03:33:14,580 --> 03:33:26,685
[SPEAKER_18]: So when those two came together and they were even that we talked about at the school committee meeting, we talked about it with the principals, there was a whole influx of new activities after school activities that started to happen.

1296
03:33:27,265 --> 03:33:30,006
[SPEAKER_18]: Those numbers became aligned and we saw that number drop.

1297
03:33:30,026 --> 03:33:32,347
[SPEAKER_18]: So parents were monitoring their kids.

1298
03:33:33,007 --> 03:33:38,653
[SPEAKER_18]: more closely, the schools addressed some of the pro-social things that needed to be addressed in the community.

1299
03:33:39,694 --> 03:33:44,919
[SPEAKER_18]: It was a real sort of like chasm of everybody working together, I think, and that really helped drive those numbers down.

1300
03:33:46,220 --> 03:33:50,485
[SPEAKER_14]: And do you have a sense of how many kids are using but don't report on the survey?

1301
03:33:51,065 --> 03:33:54,649
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's just sort of a given with these surveys, right?

1302
03:33:56,584 --> 03:34:05,889
[SPEAKER_18]: To be honest with you, a lot of people who are using substances know very well that they don't want to be using substances, and so they do self-report pretty accurately on these surveys.

1303
03:34:06,209 --> 03:34:15,734
[SPEAKER_18]: They may not want to be forthcoming with someone that knows them and may feel shame if they were to report, but when it's anonymous, it's secretive.

1304
03:34:15,814 --> 03:34:18,395
[SPEAKER_18]: They actually do fill them out pretty accurately, at least that's what

1305
03:34:19,256 --> 03:34:22,141
[SPEAKER_18]: nationally, that's what the story has been.

1306
03:34:22,161 --> 03:34:26,628
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't have the exact scientific fact for you, but that's what I do know.

1307
03:34:28,052 --> 03:34:28,452
[SPEAKER_28]: very good.

1308
03:34:28,633 --> 03:34:30,494
[SPEAKER_28]: Is there a motion to receive this report?

1309
03:34:30,554 --> 03:34:31,075
[SPEAKER_25]: One more question.

1310
03:34:31,095 --> 03:34:31,195
[SPEAKER_25]: Ms.

1311
03:34:31,235 --> 03:34:31,555
[SPEAKER_25]: Cuno.

1312
03:34:31,695 --> 03:34:39,963
[SPEAKER_25]: Actually, I was just thinking of the bullet points that we were talking about, whether it be Sebastian or both of you, is the other one about getting into our vehicle.

1313
03:34:40,464 --> 03:34:40,684
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

1314
03:34:40,964 --> 03:34:42,305
[SPEAKER_25]: With someone who's been vaping.

1315
03:34:42,546 --> 03:34:43,286
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah.

1316
03:34:43,366 --> 03:34:46,209
[SPEAKER_25]: Which is very important and it's very serious.

1317
03:34:47,190 --> 03:34:51,734
[SPEAKER_25]: And I think that would be a bullet point really to put out there because I don't think

1318
03:34:52,715 --> 03:34:54,836
[SPEAKER_25]: People are aware of how serious that could be.

1319
03:34:55,356 --> 03:35:04,079
[SPEAKER_25]: Because we're, you know, we've been trained in our mind, and as kids we've been trained in our minds too, is, you know, you don't get into a vehicle with someone who's been drinking.

1320
03:35:04,159 --> 03:35:04,339
[SPEAKER_25]: Right.

1321
03:35:04,639 --> 03:35:05,839
[SPEAKER_25]: No one's been talking about this.

1322
03:35:05,919 --> 03:35:07,040
[SPEAKER_25]: This is, you know, newer.

1323
03:35:07,460 --> 03:35:10,001
[SPEAKER_25]: So I think that's definitely a point we need to put out there.

1324
03:35:10,301 --> 03:35:10,481
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

1325
03:35:10,761 --> 03:35:12,902
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it's a really important one to talk about for sure.

1326
03:35:14,002 --> 03:35:17,872
[SPEAKER_28]: Very good on the motion this report being received and placed on file all those in favor.

1327
03:35:17,952 --> 03:35:18,433
[SPEAKER_28]: Aye.

1328
03:35:18,734 --> 03:35:19,375
[SPEAKER_28]: All those opposed.

1329
03:35:19,395 --> 03:35:20,819
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you so much.

1330
03:35:20,839 --> 03:35:21,962
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you very much.

1331
03:35:26,724 --> 03:35:29,965
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, motion to revert to the regular order of business.

1332
03:35:30,266 --> 03:35:31,066
[SPEAKER_28]: All those in favor?

1333
03:35:31,126 --> 03:35:31,426
[SPEAKER_28]: Aye.

1334
03:35:31,546 --> 03:35:32,386
[SPEAKER_28]: All those opposed?

1335
03:35:32,867 --> 03:35:33,667
[SPEAKER_28]: Motion passes.

1336
03:35:34,147 --> 03:35:39,649
[SPEAKER_28]: Report one, recommendation to approve Medford High School, Medford-Vogue Tech High School graduation date and location.

1337
03:35:39,689 --> 03:35:40,110
[SPEAKER_06]: Move approval.

1338
03:35:40,130 --> 03:35:40,950
[SPEAKER_28]: Motion to approve.

1339
03:35:40,990 --> 03:35:43,671
[SPEAKER_28]: Superintendent, well, you want me just to announce the date?

1340
03:35:43,711 --> 03:35:54,556
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we can just make one quick comment, as we've done this at this place every year for a long time now, and the reason we need to approve it so early is that if we have snow days,

1341
03:35:55,376 --> 03:35:56,657
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, we've locked in the date.

1342
03:35:57,277 --> 03:36:01,059
[SPEAKER_06]: So we don't have to have, you know, so many days.

1343
03:36:01,159 --> 03:36:03,320
[SPEAKER_06]: But if there are no snow days, we don't have to worry about it.

1344
03:36:03,900 --> 03:36:13,685
[SPEAKER_06]: And the other thing, the other thing that I just want to let you know is that Mr. William Cummings of the Cummings Foundation will speak at graduation in addition to the normal speakers.

1345
03:36:13,705 --> 03:36:14,545
[SPEAKER_28]: That's exciting.

1346
03:36:15,286 --> 03:36:15,626
[SPEAKER_28]: Excellent.

1347
03:36:15,666 --> 03:36:19,288
[SPEAKER_28]: So June 6, all those parents out there, at 6 p.m.

1348
03:36:19,328 --> 03:36:21,589
[SPEAKER_28]: at the Gancher Center at Tufts University.

1349
03:36:22,907 --> 03:36:25,352
[SPEAKER_28]: Motion to approve Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Ms.

1350
03:36:25,372 --> 03:36:25,773
[SPEAKER_28]: Kreatz.

1351
03:36:25,853 --> 03:36:26,675
[SPEAKER_28]: All those in favor?

1352
03:36:26,695 --> 03:36:27,116
[SPEAKER_28]: Aye.

1353
03:36:27,436 --> 03:36:28,078
[SPEAKER_28]: All those opposed?

1354
03:36:28,278 --> 03:36:29,060
[SPEAKER_28]: Motion passes.

1355
03:36:31,004 --> 03:36:32,106
[SPEAKER_28]: Financial report.

1356
03:36:32,166 --> 03:36:32,346
[SPEAKER_28]: Ms.

1357
03:36:32,386 --> 03:36:32,787
[SPEAKER_28]: Patterson.

1358
03:36:36,892 --> 03:36:43,434
[SPEAKER_33]: So this is our first quarterly or close to one third of the year report on our financials.

1359
03:36:44,235 --> 03:36:48,016
[SPEAKER_33]: The general fund operating budget for FY18 is $56,431,000, of which year to date we have spent 42%, 42.9%, which is a total of $24,215,786.

1360
03:36:48,076 --> 03:36:51,377
[SPEAKER_33]: And that includes both our expenditures and our encumbrances, which is reserving funds for

1361
03:37:06,596 --> 03:37:08,517
[SPEAKER_33]: anticipated and projected expenses.

1362
03:37:09,538 --> 03:37:22,928
[SPEAKER_33]: So of the amount spent to date, our 10-month biweekly employees have received nine of their checks since August 28th, with an additional special run in October to accommodate the anticipated number of checks per calendar year.

1363
03:37:23,748 --> 03:37:29,773
[SPEAKER_33]: And all 12-month employees have received 11 of their paychecks since July 1, the first start of the new fiscal year.

1364
03:37:30,956 --> 03:37:36,759
[SPEAKER_33]: So we have many staff members out on maternity leave with some additional expected in the spring.

1365
03:37:36,879 --> 03:37:37,859
[SPEAKER_33]: Currently we have nine.

1366
03:37:38,519 --> 03:37:45,843
[SPEAKER_33]: So there are some significant coverages that we're maintaining that is also long term sub capacities.

1367
03:37:47,424 --> 03:37:59,407
[SPEAKER_33]: And while there has been significant transition for teaching and other staff members during this school year, we have been able to fill the positions based on the program needs and will continue to do so as those arise.

1368
03:38:01,148 --> 03:38:03,628
[SPEAKER_33]: The business office is fully staffed.

1369
03:38:04,008 --> 03:38:09,270
[SPEAKER_33]: We transitioned from some various leaves and had significant turnover over the summer.

1370
03:38:09,850 --> 03:38:17,787
[SPEAKER_33]: So we are in the process of reclassifying our payroll codes to reflect correct budget items and be in line with

1371
03:38:18,297 --> 03:38:20,858
[SPEAKER_33]: where they were reflected for the departmental charges.

1372
03:38:21,719 --> 03:38:37,768
[SPEAKER_33]: We are also excited and encouraged to be rolling out and implementing a new automated onboarding process that's for the hiring and tracking that will greatly improve our laborious process for new hires and streamlining documentation.

1373
03:38:38,128 --> 03:38:39,709
[SPEAKER_33]: This will also be rolled out to

1374
03:38:40,249 --> 03:38:55,559
[SPEAKER_33]: current employees for data changes and updates, and it is a subsequent system for the current attendance ASOP system that we use with Frontline, and it will also include a mobile app, so that will greatly improve utilization.

1375
03:38:57,028 --> 03:39:24,086
[SPEAKER_33]: So as we continue to respond to the DESE, Department of Ed chart of account change structures, as well as additional reporting components that they have for us, we have to report and track expenses by a number of different areas, which include by school, by function code, by category, district wide, and expanding out to individual grants, the higher level grants, such as Title I and special education.

1376
03:39:25,222 --> 03:39:38,383
[SPEAKER_33]: So within the operating budget where some budget columns may be zero, the planned cost projections are included in those breakout items and the balances within each function remain to be positive.

1377
03:39:39,150 --> 03:39:50,576
[SPEAKER_33]: So we please also note that the encumbrance column, it does include amounts that we have included our best projections for year end expenditures.

1378
03:39:50,976 --> 03:39:59,900
[SPEAKER_33]: So those will continue to be monitored, liquidated and updated as costs are trued up as the invoices come in and actual payments are relieved.

1379
03:40:00,800 --> 03:40:05,723
[SPEAKER_33]: So included with the summary are some of the key program areas within our general fund.

1380
03:40:06,661 --> 03:40:09,923
[SPEAKER_33]: The first of which is the largest component of our budget is salaries.

1381
03:40:11,043 --> 03:40:18,767
[SPEAKER_33]: In fiscal year 2018, we have two salary increments that were awarded for the collective bargaining units.

1382
03:40:18,887 --> 03:40:23,109
[SPEAKER_33]: The first was in July and or the start of their contract.

1383
03:40:23,669 --> 03:40:30,572
[SPEAKER_33]: And the second increase will be in January for the appropriate CBA groups.

1384
03:40:30,652 --> 03:40:31,393
[SPEAKER_33]: And that will be another 1%.

1385
03:40:33,007 --> 03:40:40,295
[SPEAKER_33]: So the undistributed allocation will be dispersed among the budget adjustments for different program areas.

1386
03:40:40,355 --> 03:40:51,627
[SPEAKER_33]: So as we identify the increases in certain areas, we'll be reallocating some of those amounts for personnel changes, retirement buybacks and the such.

1387
03:40:53,484 --> 03:40:55,765
[SPEAKER_33]: Another area of interest is security.

1388
03:40:56,345 --> 03:41:02,106
[SPEAKER_33]: Large investments have been made to replace and repair the security cameras throughout the district at all buildings.

1389
03:41:03,107 --> 03:41:10,269
[SPEAKER_33]: So the amount of $194,949 within the budget is earmarked for the security program reporting area.

1390
03:41:10,769 --> 03:41:14,610
[SPEAKER_33]: However, it will most likely be shifted to a capital account once appropriated.

1391
03:41:16,281 --> 03:41:22,747
[SPEAKER_33]: We expect that the projects will be completed at all schools by mid-December, and we will follow up with a detailed report.

1392
03:41:23,728 --> 03:41:31,114
[SPEAKER_33]: There have been many schools that have finalized the completion of those repairs, and we will be updating as they

1393
03:41:31,803 --> 03:41:32,943
[SPEAKER_33]: And then we'll be able to finalize as well.

1394
03:41:33,544 --> 03:41:46,089
[SPEAKER_33]: So security in the buildings is a priority, and the district continues to demonstrate its commitment to ensuring safety in the multiple areas, and that includes our staffing, training our staff members, cameras, security cameras.

1395
03:41:46,709 --> 03:41:53,272
[SPEAKER_33]: And identification stops at entrance locations, which include the Raptor license scanning and name tag system.

1396
03:41:55,112 --> 03:41:57,393
[SPEAKER_33]: Our technology is another significant area

1397
03:41:59,724 --> 03:42:06,790
[SPEAKER_33]: committee decided to infuse the system with significant funding at each of the school systems at each school building.

1398
03:42:07,510 --> 03:42:18,039
[SPEAKER_33]: There was 15,000 earmarked for the high school level, 5,000 for Curtis Tufts, 15,000 for the middle schools, and 13,000 for each elementary school, which was significant.

1399
03:42:18,799 --> 03:42:33,734
[SPEAKER_33]: We utilized those funds and used some high volume discounts along with state bid pricing to maximize the investment within those technology area and rolled out over the summer to have the carts and units available for the start of school.

1400
03:42:34,335 --> 03:42:41,822
[SPEAKER_33]: So in total we had 455 devices, new devices for this school year that were rolled out for use in each of the buildings.

1401
03:42:43,246 --> 03:42:50,128
[SPEAKER_33]: And additionally, within technology, we just received the E-rate approval that will further improve connectivity district-wide.

1402
03:42:50,828 --> 03:43:00,431
[SPEAKER_33]: And we're hoping the matching dollars that were requested from the city will be approved and we'll be able to continue the technology investment throughout school year 2018.

1403
03:43:03,103 --> 03:43:06,284
[SPEAKER_33]: Transportation continues to be a large item.

1404
03:43:07,224 --> 03:43:16,046
[SPEAKER_33]: We are currently in year three of the original three-year contract with Eastern Bus, and we have an additional two years locked in at specified rates for that contract.

1405
03:43:16,846 --> 03:43:20,126
[SPEAKER_33]: The budget reflects an anticipated reduction of one bus.

1406
03:43:20,727 --> 03:43:32,369
[SPEAKER_33]: However, we did have to bring bus number 18 back into the cycle due to the shift in newcomers programs, and so we've had to utilize the additional bus for that.

1407
03:43:33,052 --> 03:43:39,793
[SPEAKER_33]: So it shows a negative amount within that category based on the need for additional transportation.

1408
03:43:40,994 --> 03:43:46,395
[SPEAKER_33]: We also have absorbed the cost for students that attend the Minuteman Vocational School.

1409
03:43:47,135 --> 03:43:52,356
[SPEAKER_33]: And the amount we expect will be covered by the reduced enrollment in the tuition.

1410
03:43:52,436 --> 03:44:02,518
[SPEAKER_33]: So where we had projected additional students going out and the offset coming in for the transportation will net itself out.

1411
03:44:03,664 --> 03:44:10,168
[SPEAKER_33]: We currently provide after school buses to the middle schools, and that's per contract that was identified in the original contract.

1412
03:44:10,548 --> 03:44:15,671
[SPEAKER_33]: Three buses per day, and that's for 70 days throughout the school year.

1413
03:44:16,272 --> 03:44:31,521
[SPEAKER_33]: We've also indicated that should the elementary schools be considering additional after school programs, there would be some additional costs realized with that, and we would need to work with the provider for the levels of

1414
03:44:33,345 --> 03:44:40,513
[SPEAKER_33]: trips and participation and timing of those trips because the routes are all intertwined and combined.

1415
03:44:40,573 --> 03:44:52,067
[SPEAKER_33]: So there may be possibility for an additional contractor at that point if it was decided and determined to go forward with that additional expense in the transportation area.

1416
03:44:53,444 --> 03:44:58,768
[SPEAKER_33]: are utilities, which covers natural gas, electricity, water.

1417
03:44:59,769 --> 03:45:07,255
[SPEAKER_33]: We encumber the utilities based on historical years of usage, and we budget conservatively for unexpected occurrences.

1418
03:45:08,243 --> 03:45:11,085
[SPEAKER_33]: So our natural gas rates have been very favorable.

1419
03:45:11,705 --> 03:45:15,248
[SPEAKER_33]: Utilization has been lower due to milder winters.

1420
03:45:15,408 --> 03:45:22,292
[SPEAKER_33]: However, we still have not experienced the cold months for this fiscal year, so we're not quite sure how that will land.

1421
03:45:23,153 --> 03:45:37,082
[SPEAKER_33]: Electricity continues to be volatile in the marketplace, and we will be expecting a slightly higher rate beginning next fiscal year, which we have locked in with City Hall working with the Power Options Company.

1422
03:45:37,782 --> 03:45:46,406
[SPEAKER_33]: So our current rate is slightly lower, which is for the supply cost at 0.0882 per kilowatt hour.

1423
03:45:46,987 --> 03:45:50,328
[SPEAKER_33]: Moving into next fiscal year, we'll have 0.0931.

1424
03:45:51,369 --> 03:45:58,473
[SPEAKER_33]: So definitely moving forward as we budget and plan for that, we will need to budget some increases in that area.

1425
03:45:59,673 --> 03:46:03,795
[SPEAKER_33]: But we have encumbered the entire line item for that account.

1426
03:46:03,915 --> 03:46:04,996
[SPEAKER_33]: It has typically

1427
03:46:06,092 --> 03:46:08,933
[SPEAKER_33]: gone to the very end of that particular expense.

1428
03:46:08,973 --> 03:46:13,675
[SPEAKER_33]: So we want to maintain a conservative estimate and show that fully expended.

1429
03:46:14,835 --> 03:46:22,498
[SPEAKER_33]: So in summary, the first financial report shows that the expenditures are in line with our budget projections.

1430
03:46:22,798 --> 03:46:24,979
[SPEAKER_33]: We will continue to monitor and review them.

1431
03:46:25,839 --> 03:46:32,582
[SPEAKER_33]: And we constantly look at consolidating purchases, utilizing state bids when we can.

1432
03:46:33,257 --> 03:46:36,120
[SPEAKER_33]: and the like and identifying savings wherever possible.

1433
03:46:36,581 --> 03:46:47,592
[SPEAKER_33]: And I'd like to again thank City Hall, my counterparts at the hall that communication, cooperation has been very effective in helping us accomplish what we need to get done.

1434
03:46:49,549 --> 03:46:50,610
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1435
03:46:51,670 --> 03:46:52,911
[SPEAKER_21]: Christina, I had one question.

1436
03:46:52,991 --> 03:46:58,473
[SPEAKER_21]: Could you please explain what you mean by we are reclassifying payroll codes to reflect correct budget lines?

1437
03:46:58,913 --> 03:46:59,153
[SPEAKER_33]: Yes.

1438
03:46:59,313 --> 03:47:03,355
[SPEAKER_33]: So our payroll system is not linked with our financial system.

1439
03:47:03,475 --> 03:47:05,596
[SPEAKER_33]: So we outsource payroll.

1440
03:47:05,656 --> 03:47:08,417
[SPEAKER_33]: So we have to identify a payroll code that is

1441
03:47:09,266 --> 03:47:12,348
[SPEAKER_33]: crosswalk to our general ledger code, a financial software code.

1442
03:47:12,969 --> 03:47:24,937
[SPEAKER_33]: So those codes, which was a much smaller code number, may not necessarily be aligned with what our either newly identified budget financial account code is, general ledger account.

1443
03:47:25,337 --> 03:47:36,265
[SPEAKER_33]: So we're going through now and really scouring those areas to look at some anomalies that might be occurring and to make sure that where we budgeted individuals based on department

1444
03:47:36,707 --> 03:47:40,414
[SPEAKER_33]: school wide that they are correctly classified in in the payroll code.

1445
03:47:40,555 --> 03:47:48,330
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay so it doesn't mean that somebody who was added to the business office on or transferred in the role was given different classification.

1446
03:47:48,780 --> 03:47:49,941
[SPEAKER_33]: No, no, no, no.

1447
03:47:49,981 --> 03:47:52,044
[SPEAKER_33]: This is strictly an accounting function.

1448
03:47:52,364 --> 03:48:00,573
[SPEAKER_33]: So identifying the crosswalk from our payroll system to our general fund accounting system.

1449
03:48:00,833 --> 03:48:00,953
[SPEAKER_31]: Ms.

1450
03:48:01,013 --> 03:48:02,014
[SPEAKER_31]: Kreatz.

1451
03:48:02,135 --> 03:48:03,156
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, Christine.

1452
03:48:03,296 --> 03:48:04,037
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you for the reports.

1453
03:48:04,117 --> 03:48:04,517
[SPEAKER_31]: Excellent.

1454
03:48:04,878 --> 03:48:06,459
[SPEAKER_31]: I just have one question.

1455
03:48:06,599 --> 03:48:08,722
[SPEAKER_31]: It does mention, I was going to ask about the cameras.

1456
03:48:09,122 --> 03:48:13,446
[SPEAKER_31]: So it mentions that a large investment was made to replace and repair security cameras.

1457
03:48:13,986 --> 03:48:23,414
[SPEAKER_31]: And I know a lot of us were getting emails throughout the fall where a lot of parents were very concerned because a lot of cameras were out and they weren't operating.

1458
03:48:23,775 --> 03:48:32,542
[SPEAKER_31]: So are there any cameras that are still in need of repair or were all the cameras that were malfunctioning and not operating?

1459
03:48:32,967 --> 03:48:34,328
[SPEAKER_33]: were they all repaired?

1460
03:48:34,688 --> 03:48:42,515
[SPEAKER_33]: So we've addressed all of the inoperable cameras that were the critical areas for observation.

1461
03:48:43,015 --> 03:48:47,639
[SPEAKER_33]: So all of those have been addressed with the investment that we have provided.

1462
03:48:48,079 --> 03:48:52,162
[SPEAKER_33]: They are not all currently complete, as the contractor is still working on them.

1463
03:48:52,703 --> 03:49:01,230
[SPEAKER_33]: So they have several teams at several locations, and they anticipate being complete in the next couple of weeks.

1464
03:49:02,267 --> 03:49:04,269
[SPEAKER_26]: Can I ask a point of clarification?

1465
03:49:04,830 --> 03:49:05,831
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1466
03:49:07,012 --> 03:49:09,374
[SPEAKER_26]: So you said the key point cameras.

1467
03:49:09,395 --> 03:49:14,740
[SPEAKER_26]: Does that mean all cameras are now online and working or just key point?

1468
03:49:15,020 --> 03:49:15,641
[SPEAKER_33]: No, no.

1469
03:49:15,781 --> 03:49:25,051
[SPEAKER_33]: As I mentioned, it's that repairs and replacements have not all been done to this date, to date right now for reporting back to you.

1470
03:49:25,803 --> 03:49:49,445
[SPEAKER_33]: Many of the schools have been and they are in process right now So that's where we will be finalizing the update in a couple of weeks when they are complete So they did I believe the Roberts is complete some of the other highly critical areas, but the larger Projects that were greater in scale are still ongoing so they're in in the process of being

1471
03:49:50,071 --> 03:49:51,072
[SPEAKER_33]: repaired and replaced.

1472
03:49:51,292 --> 03:49:54,356
[SPEAKER_33]: Do we have a completion hopeful date?

1473
03:49:54,636 --> 03:49:55,057
[SPEAKER_26]: Two weeks.

1474
03:49:55,617 --> 03:50:04,047
[SPEAKER_26]: And then all cameras within the district will be up and running and functioning appropriately?

1475
03:50:04,928 --> 03:50:08,552
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that it's really important to understand that cameras are fragile.

1476
03:50:09,788 --> 03:50:22,140
[SPEAKER_06]: and that every year we're going to have to allocate money for this because lightning strikes, all kinds of things take place that are beyond our control and we can go all year long and then find that we need.

1477
03:50:23,180 --> 03:50:25,441
[SPEAKER_06]: cameras that have to be replaced going into the school year.

1478
03:50:25,481 --> 03:50:33,867
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think the key thing, you know, apropos to your question is, is that are we covering the areas that people need to be, have covered, that people can see?

1479
03:50:33,907 --> 03:50:34,927
[SPEAKER_06]: The answer is yes.

1480
03:50:36,708 --> 03:50:41,771
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'll try to, you know, continually prioritize as we go forward.

1481
03:50:41,811 --> 03:50:46,954
[SPEAKER_06]: If a camera goes down, we certainly want to ensure that a key area is covered.

1482
03:50:47,014 --> 03:50:51,257
[SPEAKER_06]: So rather than one that might be a duplicate of an existing area.

1483
03:50:53,345 --> 03:50:57,306
[SPEAKER_06]: For the most part, in the middle of December, we believe everything will be fixed.

1484
03:50:59,027 --> 03:51:13,231
[SPEAKER_26]: Just as another follow-up, I know that Attorney Bill O'Keefe offered to supply us with extra cameras, and even if we have them as a stash of backup cameras, he's more than willing to donate them.

1485
03:51:13,271 --> 03:51:15,552
[SPEAKER_26]: He has in the past, and he has more to donate.

1486
03:51:15,612 --> 03:51:18,153
[SPEAKER_26]: So I'm making a motion now.

1487
03:51:19,054 --> 03:51:26,800
[SPEAKER_26]: that the superintendent reach out to him and just see if they're functioning with our system now and if it's appropriate to have them as backup cameras.

1488
03:51:27,121 --> 03:51:29,443
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me answer that before we go too far down the road.

1489
03:51:30,463 --> 03:51:34,627
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. O'Keefe did provide a substantial number, 30 additional cameras this year.

1490
03:51:35,108 --> 03:51:37,049
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of them are not compatible with what we need.

1491
03:51:37,610 --> 03:51:43,114
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of them can be used for limited purposes, but given what we're doing right now and given the upgrade in technology,

1492
03:51:44,055 --> 03:51:52,679
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, what's coming out of that institution that Bill gets it from, uh, is not necessarily compatible with what we've got.

1493
03:51:52,699 --> 03:51:57,362
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a few that can be, so we've got to screen them out, but we really can't be overly dependent on that.

1494
03:51:57,842 --> 03:52:12,049
[SPEAKER_06]: We appreciate what Bill's done, but on the other hand, we've got to be careful that, uh, they're mostly inside cameras, and the things that deal with outside cameras are very different, and we're also dealing with a different way of, uh, of a transmission, uh, than we previously did.

1495
03:52:13,730 --> 03:52:18,256
[SPEAKER_06]: We can use them periodically, but it's not a one-to-one kind of application, but we do appreciate it.

1496
03:52:18,396 --> 03:52:18,857
[SPEAKER_26]: All right.

1497
03:52:18,897 --> 03:52:21,401
[SPEAKER_26]: I also make a motion to send him a thank you note.

1498
03:52:21,861 --> 03:52:23,724
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we did once, but I'll send it again.

1499
03:52:23,744 --> 03:52:30,033
[SPEAKER_26]: Consistently over the years providing us with any technology that comes to his hands.

1500
03:52:31,028 --> 03:53:00,047
[SPEAKER_26]: So that was the security issue I was I wanted some clarity on the business office team and now that it's fully staffed What types of movement will happen were there any positions added like I'm just curious I know we talked about HR person at one point the superintendent mentioned something like that I just was wondering what what that looks like now or maybe we could even get like, you know, a workshop plan.

1501
03:53:00,128 --> 03:53:00,328
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah.

1502
03:53:00,388 --> 03:53:00,688
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you

1503
03:53:01,448 --> 03:53:02,589
[SPEAKER_33]: you want to talk about that?

1504
03:53:02,609 --> 03:53:03,490
[SPEAKER_33]: Absolutely with that.

1505
03:53:03,750 --> 03:53:06,332
[SPEAKER_33]: So we had a maternity leave that was not covered.

1506
03:53:07,032 --> 03:53:08,233
[SPEAKER_33]: So we were understaffed.

1507
03:53:08,734 --> 03:53:14,938
[SPEAKER_33]: We also had transition from one of our team members who went to another department within the school.

1508
03:53:15,659 --> 03:53:20,722
[SPEAKER_33]: We had to, uh, fill another payroll position, so there's been nothing added.

1509
03:53:21,242 --> 03:53:25,065
[SPEAKER_33]: We've been backfilling and trying to maintain and keep keep the

1510
03:53:30,822 --> 03:53:35,004
[SPEAKER_33]: a replacement for an open position that had, um, transferred.

1511
03:53:35,605 --> 03:53:44,329
[SPEAKER_26]: Can we see that chart anyway, just so, as committee members, we have an idea of what the roles are, who's in, like, who's in those roles.

1512
03:53:44,369 --> 03:53:51,673
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, that would be helpful, because if we have any questions moving forward, of course we'd go to the superintendent, but, you know, it's just to know.

1513
03:53:51,833 --> 03:53:52,974
[SPEAKER_26]: Names and job titles.

1514
03:53:52,994 --> 03:53:54,275
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, that would be great.

1515
03:53:54,555 --> 03:53:54,875
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1516
03:53:57,225 --> 03:54:03,349
[SPEAKER_06]: have expectations of coming forward with a proposal as the year progresses to enhance our human resources capacity.

1517
03:54:03,829 --> 03:54:12,535
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's become a major, major area, and you cannot continue to just simply treat it as a, you know, byproduct of everything else going on.

1518
03:54:12,615 --> 03:54:15,837
[SPEAKER_06]: So that will come forward as a major proposal, and we'll have that discussion.

1519
03:54:18,563 --> 03:54:33,216
[SPEAKER_26]: I just also want to speak about the community schools budget, and I know that the committee approved almost two years ago about having it quarterly, so just as a friendly reminder that I'd like to see that coming forward soon.

1520
03:54:33,236 --> 03:54:33,576
[SPEAKER_06]: We will.

1521
03:54:34,357 --> 03:54:35,158
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you very much.

1522
03:54:35,238 --> 03:54:42,544
[SPEAKER_26]: Maybe we can even add it to the list of items on the back of our agenda so we don't forget, because I might forget if it's not written.

1523
03:54:42,644 --> 03:54:43,004
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1524
03:54:43,024 --> 03:54:44,766
[SPEAKER_06]: I doubt you're going to forget.

1525
03:54:48,213 --> 03:54:58,343
[SPEAKER_28]: .

1526
03:54:48,233 --> 03:54:58,343
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you very much is there a motion on the floor to accept this motion to accept the report place on file yes seconded by miss van de Kloet along with a thank you.

1527
03:54:58,363 --> 03:55:01,466
[SPEAKER_28]: To keep all those in favor hi all those opposed.

1528
03:55:02,246 --> 03:55:02,987
[SPEAKER_28]: Motion granted.

1529
03:55:03,007 --> 03:55:05,750
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you Christine okay thank you Kirsten.

1530
03:55:07,391 --> 03:55:09,253
[SPEAKER_28]: Item number three report on bilingual

1531
03:55:12,626 --> 03:55:24,190
[SPEAKER_06]: So, as you probably know, the state legislature has approved an option for school districts to incorporate bilingual education into the existing SEI format.

1532
03:55:24,950 --> 03:55:38,334
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, 15 years ago, Ron Unz, who came from California, pushed an initiative petition, which previously had some success in Arizona and California, and Massachusetts decided that it would adopt it as well.

1533
03:55:39,434 --> 03:55:46,238
[SPEAKER_06]: It was given great support from John Silber at the time, and also Mitt Romney, who was a gubernatorial candidate, and it carried its way.

1534
03:55:47,158 --> 03:55:49,839
[SPEAKER_06]: Since the time it's been implemented, there's been mixed results.

1535
03:55:51,560 --> 03:56:07,908
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, but it comes with that whole idea that, you know, everyone should speak English, and we believe they should, but how to learn to speak English, especially to learn subjects that require deep cognitive knowledge, cognitive language, is not so easily done.

1536
03:56:09,128 --> 03:56:12,970
[SPEAKER_06]: And there are reasons for blending and doing things a little bit differently.

1537
03:56:14,870 --> 03:56:16,711
[SPEAKER_06]: We obviously are looking at that.

1538
03:56:16,751 --> 03:56:24,534
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to be waiting for the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education to give us the latest guidelines as they see them.

1539
03:56:24,594 --> 03:56:25,614
[SPEAKER_06]: And we haven't seen them yet.

1540
03:56:25,674 --> 03:56:29,796
[SPEAKER_06]: We probably won't see them until either late spring or perhaps even into the summer.

1541
03:56:30,416 --> 03:56:34,898
[SPEAKER_06]: So I doubt there's going to be much done in the next fiscal year.

1542
03:56:36,218 --> 03:56:51,807
[SPEAKER_06]: We are going to look at the blend of programs and that Paul is going to come up in a minute and talk about that and how it comes together so that we can take advantage of the law where it's appropriate while at the same time not lose track of situations which are best served by the current SEI.

1543
03:56:52,768 --> 03:56:55,870
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, as you probably know, our teachers have

1544
03:56:56,750 --> 03:57:09,404
[SPEAKER_06]: been working to get SCI endorsements, which are required now for teachers who work with students who have EL requirements, and the vast majority of faculty members do, especially in the core academic areas.

1545
03:57:09,744 --> 03:57:15,070
[SPEAKER_06]: However, there's still some gaps, and there's still a need to continue pushing that as people

1546
03:57:15,490 --> 03:57:22,492
[SPEAKER_06]: receive students who have this English language need to make sure that the teachers are fully prepared for them.

1547
03:57:24,513 --> 03:57:30,795
[SPEAKER_06]: We also have the issue of dealing with the distribution of students with EL and we're going to look at that.

1548
03:57:30,895 --> 03:57:32,436
[SPEAKER_06]: We did some distribution this year.

1549
03:57:33,076 --> 03:57:34,436
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll have some comment about that.

1550
03:57:34,937 --> 03:57:36,157
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not an easy subject.

1551
03:57:36,277 --> 03:57:40,378
[SPEAKER_06]: Because as you move people around, you solve one problem, you create another.

1552
03:57:40,818 --> 03:57:52,901
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to provide some options for you in the beginning of the year, sometime in January, so you can look at what options are available to you and what it means financially and what it means programmatically.

1553
03:57:53,701 --> 03:58:00,223
[SPEAKER_06]: But tonight, we want to give you an idea about the law, the pros, the cons of it, and some of the other things that Paul has put together.

1554
03:58:00,263 --> 03:58:03,904
[SPEAKER_06]: So with permission, Paul, if you'd come on up and give us a

1555
03:58:05,615 --> 03:58:07,096
[SPEAKER_06]: A discussion on this topic.

1556
03:58:07,977 --> 03:58:09,038
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening, everyone.

1557
03:58:10,399 --> 03:58:18,026
[SPEAKER_05]: So this bill allows districts to choose what type of programming works best for their communities.

1558
03:58:18,666 --> 03:58:28,795
[SPEAKER_05]: Unlike the old TBE, they had it set up where it was mandatory if you had 20 or more students who spoke in the language group.

1559
03:58:30,356 --> 03:58:38,640
[SPEAKER_05]: During that time, students in their first year, it was 20% of instruction was in English, 80% was in the target language.

1560
03:58:38,680 --> 03:58:40,641
[SPEAKER_05]: Year two, it was a 50-50 split.

1561
03:58:41,001 --> 03:58:47,364
[SPEAKER_05]: And then year three, it was 20% in the target language and 80%, I'm sorry, 20% in the native language and 80% in the target language.

1562
03:58:51,725 --> 03:58:56,568
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't know what guidance the state's going to come out with regarding this.

1563
03:58:57,128 --> 03:59:04,931
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to look at licensure because all of the bilingual licenses were put on hold by DESE 15 years ago when that ended.

1564
03:59:06,412 --> 03:59:08,593
[SPEAKER_05]: So we don't know what their requirements will be.

1565
03:59:09,193 --> 03:59:09,853
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't know

1566
03:59:11,714 --> 03:59:14,215
[SPEAKER_05]: really what their guidance will be with programming.

1567
03:59:15,155 --> 03:59:21,456
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't, my understanding of it as the bill is written, is it doesn't have to be a full-on program as it was in the past.

1568
03:59:21,936 --> 03:59:29,998
[SPEAKER_05]: We can now have just individual classes that can support our students who speak other languages.

1569
03:59:30,098 --> 03:59:38,140
[SPEAKER_05]: So as Mr. Belson and I were talking about this initially, we're thinking, you know, start out when we look at our language groups, Portuguese is our highest

1570
03:59:39,520 --> 03:59:42,442
[SPEAKER_05]: highest number of speakers at the high school.

1571
03:59:43,283 --> 03:59:50,387
[SPEAKER_05]: Our high school students are at a disadvantage because they have a finite period of time in which to learn language, pass all of their MCAS tests.

1572
03:59:50,407 --> 04:00:06,318
[SPEAKER_05]: So if we were to introduce something here in Medford, we would look at those protocol, you know, the protocol set out by the Department of Ed, look at our student population, which again, changes on a regular basis, and make those decisions at that time.

1573
04:00:09,295 --> 04:00:09,795
[SPEAKER_25]: Miss Cugno.

1574
04:00:11,777 --> 04:00:15,701
[SPEAKER_25]: I know that we really don't have a lot of questions to ask because you won't have the answers to them.

1575
04:00:16,301 --> 04:00:21,706
[SPEAKER_25]: But I guess I don't know why this has never even come to my head before, but I want to ask you a question.

1576
04:00:21,746 --> 04:00:25,049
[SPEAKER_25]: When students come to the high school and they speak a different language,

1577
04:00:26,770 --> 04:00:41,179
[SPEAKER_25]: I know that we have specific classes that we have to go into, but are they partnered with anybody in the high school themselves like to go to lunch with or anything like that that are here in our system as students and speak both languages?

1578
04:00:41,299 --> 04:00:49,664
[SPEAKER_25]: And the reason I said that is I don't know why it's never really hit me, but many years ago going here, we had students that came in from Italy.

1579
04:00:49,684 --> 04:00:51,826
[SPEAKER_25]: I remember my teacher actually asking me,

1580
04:00:52,566 --> 04:00:58,671
[SPEAKER_25]: to see if that student could, well at that time our schedules were different, so that student had to come to all the classes I went to.

1581
04:00:59,332 --> 04:01:09,180
[SPEAKER_25]: But at least to have someone that they could go to lunch with, introduce them to other people, that maybe, you know, speak the language that they're here, and in English.

1582
04:01:09,400 --> 04:01:11,522
[SPEAKER_25]: And I don't, you know, I've never even asked that question.

1583
04:01:11,542 --> 04:01:12,083
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't even know why.

1584
04:01:12,663 --> 04:01:27,195
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, when the students come here who don't speak English, they're set up with special, with their classes that are with an ESL teacher or a duly certified teacher who is certified in the content as well as ESL.

1585
04:01:27,515 --> 04:01:30,398
[SPEAKER_05]: And those are our newcomer classrooms even here at the high school.

1586
04:01:31,439 --> 04:01:36,563
[SPEAKER_05]: The teachers in collaboration with the building, with the assistant principals and guidance

1587
04:01:36,923 --> 04:01:46,274
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of have an informal protocol to set up students with other students, but it's not formalized, it's not a specific program.

1588
04:01:46,695 --> 04:01:52,422
[SPEAKER_05]: But the actual classes, the students are with all newcomers in these newcomer classrooms.

1589
04:01:52,822 --> 04:01:53,923
[SPEAKER_25]: No, I understood that.

1590
04:01:53,963 --> 04:02:07,354
[SPEAKER_25]: I just didn't know if there was someone that they could hook them up with and, you know, at least show them, you know, to go to lunch with and maybe introduce them to their friends and, you know, that way at least interpret for them, especially when they come into a new building.

1591
04:02:08,115 --> 04:02:12,558
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, you speak the language and you walk into a building or a new atmosphere and it's intimidating.

1592
04:02:13,038 --> 04:02:16,400
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, to come in and not know the language is even worse.

1593
04:02:16,821 --> 04:02:23,445
[SPEAKER_25]: So I was just thinking, like I said, years ago, my teachers just asked if we would take students along with us, at least at the beginning.

1594
04:02:24,565 --> 04:02:39,751
[SPEAKER_25]: because it is very difficult to mandate someone to say, okay, you're going to be with that student every day, but at least to merge them into lunch, and where are the bathrooms, and where is the cafeteria, and how do you go talk to the principal, and how do I get back into that classroom that I was supposed to go into?

1595
04:02:40,071 --> 04:02:41,872
[SPEAKER_05]: And like I said, that's done informally.

1596
04:02:41,892 --> 04:02:48,655
[SPEAKER_05]: There's not a formal protocol or process for that, but the teachers work in collaboration with the guidance department on that.

1597
04:02:49,929 --> 04:02:50,509
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you very much.

1598
04:02:50,570 --> 04:02:50,730
[SPEAKER_21]: Ms.

1599
04:02:50,750 --> 04:02:51,210
[SPEAKER_21]: Van der Kloot.

1600
04:02:51,951 --> 04:02:58,475
[SPEAKER_21]: So, Mr. Texerra, are we or are you thinking that we would pilot a program in Portuguese for next school year?

1601
04:02:59,476 --> 04:03:01,478
[SPEAKER_05]: I would wait until guidance comes out.

1602
04:03:01,518 --> 04:03:13,106
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm actually going to a state meeting this Friday that will give me some additional information and maybe I'll have a timeline on when the state will, you know, come out with their guidance.

1603
04:03:13,727 --> 04:03:17,690
[SPEAKER_05]: But I wouldn't move forward with anything until the guidance came forth.

1604
04:03:18,030 --> 04:03:37,707
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, so um and at Medford High School say for the Portuguese students level one and level two would be those students who were certainly level one would be the students who were just coming to us and level two they might have been with us for Well those levels are based on what we do as a screener test when the students arrive.

1605
04:03:37,747 --> 04:03:38,767
[SPEAKER_05]: It's based on um

1606
04:03:39,748 --> 04:03:45,730
[SPEAKER_05]: WIDA testing, we're using the WIDA screener, and that gives us the level.

1607
04:03:46,130 --> 04:03:54,372
[SPEAKER_05]: So students may have had English in their native country, which is why they would test as a level two, but they're still a newcomer, you know, just arrival.

1608
04:03:54,492 --> 04:03:59,333
[SPEAKER_05]: Other students, you know, that are level one most likely didn't have English in their native country.

1609
04:04:00,570 --> 04:04:13,525
[SPEAKER_21]: The other question, which certainly is to be addressed to you, but a little bit different, is that we changed significantly this year when we split some programs between the Roberts and the Brooks.

1610
04:04:14,166 --> 04:04:15,067
[SPEAKER_21]: How is that working out?

1611
04:04:18,709 --> 04:04:22,591
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd have to, I mean, are you looking for something specific?

1612
04:04:22,731 --> 04:04:31,674
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, I was just curious, I think one of the concerns had to do with siblings and the ability of siblings to oversee their, you know, sisters and brothers.

1613
04:04:32,355 --> 04:04:42,279
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that the Parent Information Center has been struggling with trying to do the placement that best meets both children, and in some cases that hasn't actually happened.

1614
04:04:43,004 --> 04:04:47,606
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, so at some point I'd like to ask for a report on how that's worked out.

1615
04:04:48,326 --> 04:04:51,647
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be tied into our discussion about options.

1616
04:04:51,948 --> 04:04:53,168
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, sounds great.

1617
04:04:53,228 --> 04:05:00,371
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a larger picture and, you know, Paul and I have had some serious discussions about the pros and cons of any kind of movement of people.

1618
04:05:00,871 --> 04:05:07,534
[SPEAKER_06]: What it means for staff, what it means for transportation, what it means for siblings, what it means for, you know, language groupings.

1619
04:05:08,314 --> 04:05:12,879
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a very complex issue, and it requires a great deal of trade-off.

1620
04:05:12,899 --> 04:05:22,249
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to decide what's the most important thing to us, what are the most important issues to us, and how we're going to solve them, because there's no one perfect solution for any of this.

1621
04:05:23,130 --> 04:05:23,450
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you.

1622
04:05:24,091 --> 04:05:24,191
[SPEAKER_30]: Ms.

1623
04:05:24,231 --> 04:05:27,735
[SPEAKER_30]: Mastone, thank you for your report, both of you for your report.

1624
04:05:28,095 --> 04:05:38,478
[SPEAKER_30]: The last paragraph on the report is, if we were to move either program to the Andrews, there are at least 10 teachers who will need the SEI endorsement.

1625
04:05:39,418 --> 04:05:44,839
[SPEAKER_30]: Organizations such as MatSol, Revis, Steam, I don't know any of them, will do training in the district.

1626
04:05:44,879 --> 04:05:50,521
[SPEAKER_30]: The cost is between $8,800 and $12,000 for anywhere from 25 to 30 participants.

1627
04:05:50,881 --> 04:05:51,641
[SPEAKER_30]: So that's new to me.

1628
04:05:51,681 --> 04:05:53,741
[SPEAKER_30]: I didn't know that there was a separate training.

1629
04:05:53,822 --> 04:05:55,422
[SPEAKER_30]: And is it, how long is the training?

1630
04:05:56,584 --> 04:05:57,946
[SPEAKER_05]: It's intense, it's a 40 hour course.

1631
04:05:59,813 --> 04:06:06,577
[SPEAKER_30]: And so these companies will all come to our city and would train the teachers who need this certification?

1632
04:06:06,797 --> 04:06:07,017
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1633
04:06:07,737 --> 04:06:13,340
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's only certain providers can give it because this was governed under the Department of Justice.

1634
04:06:14,741 --> 04:06:20,865
[SPEAKER_05]: So like Medford can't just offer their own training and say, okay, you're retail endorsed.

1635
04:06:21,005 --> 04:06:26,328
[SPEAKER_05]: It has to be through one of the state providers because the Department of Justice is still overseeing it.

1636
04:06:27,108 --> 04:06:27,509
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1637
04:06:27,849 --> 04:06:34,257
[SPEAKER_06]: At one time it should be noted that the courses were offered free, but that gate is now closed.

1638
04:06:34,758 --> 04:06:34,978
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1639
04:06:34,998 --> 04:06:42,968
[SPEAKER_06]: So now we have to, if we have openings for new people, if they're not coming out of colleges with the SEL endorsement, we have to actually offer it if they have students.

1640
04:06:43,328 --> 04:06:43,769
[SPEAKER_30]: Okay.

1641
04:06:43,929 --> 04:06:44,189
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1642
04:06:45,757 --> 04:06:49,764
[SPEAKER_28]: Is there a motion to receive and place this paper in place on file, ma'am?

1643
04:06:49,824 --> 04:06:52,990
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm Mr. Skerry, seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

1644
04:06:53,010 --> 04:06:54,172
[SPEAKER_28]: All those in favor?

1645
04:06:55,033 --> 04:06:55,274
[SPEAKER_27]: Aye.

1646
04:06:55,334 --> 04:06:55,694
[SPEAKER_28]: Opposed?

1647
04:06:55,774 --> 04:06:56,436
[SPEAKER_28]: Motion passes.

1648
04:06:56,456 --> 04:06:57,477
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you Mr. Texer.

1649
04:06:59,269 --> 04:07:04,233
[SPEAKER_28]: Item five recommendation to approve Rick revised field trip policy, Mr. Superintendent.

1650
04:07:04,293 --> 04:07:16,083
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to ask our deputy superintendent to Bernadette Bernadette to director of curriculum to tell us how we responded to some of the issues that were raised recently.

1651
04:07:19,454 --> 04:07:19,914
[SPEAKER_29]: Good evening.

1652
04:07:21,276 --> 04:07:32,224
[SPEAKER_29]: So at the Committee of the Whole meeting on November 13th, Deputy Superintendent Beverly Nelson gave an overview of the draft of the field trip policy.

1653
04:07:33,946 --> 04:07:47,436
[SPEAKER_29]: It is important to note, I want to give credit where credit is due, that the substantive part of this policy really was developed by Tony Vento, Director of Health Services, and Gail Trainor, Assistant Principal at the high school.

1654
04:07:48,737 --> 04:08:00,722
[SPEAKER_29]: So Beverly, Tony, Gail, and I reviewed this in light of the comments that the committee had on the 13th and we made the following revisions.

1655
04:08:01,322 --> 04:08:04,344
[SPEAKER_29]: There are five revisions that I will go over.

1656
04:08:04,864 --> 04:08:09,626
[SPEAKER_29]: The first revision is that we added an accessibility statement.

1657
04:08:10,246 --> 04:08:18,173
[SPEAKER_29]: So if you look on page one of the document, the bottom of page one, in bold print, we added the following.

1658
04:08:18,673 --> 04:08:24,898
[SPEAKER_29]: The Metro Public Schools is committed to ensuring that district field trips are accessible to all students.

1659
04:08:25,579 --> 04:08:36,188
[SPEAKER_29]: The policy adheres to all requirements set forth in both Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act, also known as ADA, of 1990.

1660
04:08:37,789 --> 04:08:40,290
[SPEAKER_29]: So we addressed that concern with that statement.

1661
04:08:42,390 --> 04:08:50,132
[SPEAKER_29]: The second concern that we addressed has to do with the definition of a chaperone.

1662
04:08:50,652 --> 04:08:57,414
[SPEAKER_29]: And a chaperone includes any adult who is vested or non-vested with monitoring student safety.

1663
04:08:57,854 --> 04:08:59,915
[SPEAKER_29]: So if you look on page two of your document,

1664
04:09:02,799 --> 04:09:06,580
[SPEAKER_29]: The second half of the page, next to where it says chaperones, I will read that.

1665
04:09:07,161 --> 04:09:08,821
[SPEAKER_29]: So the wording now is the following.

1666
04:09:09,402 --> 04:09:22,868
[SPEAKER_29]: Chaperone is any employee of the Metro Public Schools or parent slash guardian or any adult that attends a trip and is vested or non-vested with the responsibility of monitoring student safety.

1667
04:09:24,113 --> 04:09:32,948
[SPEAKER_29]: does not say a criminal offender record information or a quarry check of all chaperones must be on file in the superintendent's office at least seven days prior to the date of the trip.

1668
04:09:38,479 --> 04:09:48,468
[SPEAKER_29]: The third concern has to do with in emergency situations, the school committee will be added to the list of entities that will be notified.

1669
04:09:48,849 --> 04:09:58,738
[SPEAKER_29]: So if you look on page 3 of the document, under letter J, Roman numeral 3, lowercase Roman numeral 3,

1670
04:10:00,051 --> 04:10:02,633
[SPEAKER_29]: you will see that members of the school committee have added.

1671
04:10:02,993 --> 04:10:22,985
[SPEAKER_29]: So I'll read all of J. Should an emergency situation occur, the sponsoring faculty member is responsible for notifying to the best of their ability by telephone, text, or email as soon as possible, but no later than 24 hours after the emergency situation occurs, the following individuals.

1672
04:10:23,586 --> 04:10:26,308
[SPEAKER_29]: The superintendent, headmaster, and principal.

1673
04:10:27,268 --> 04:10:32,752
[SPEAKER_29]: the parent slash guardian of record, and again, number three, members of the school committee.

1674
04:10:34,293 --> 04:10:37,454
[SPEAKER_29]: So we believe that addresses that third concern.

1675
04:10:38,895 --> 04:10:40,516
[SPEAKER_29]: Going on to the fourth concern.

1676
04:10:42,097 --> 04:10:45,019
[SPEAKER_29]: So the fourth concern has to do with the term counseling services.

1677
04:10:45,399 --> 04:10:47,901
[SPEAKER_29]: We've broadened that to support services.

1678
04:10:48,321 --> 04:10:50,723
[SPEAKER_29]: So if you look in the document on page five,

1679
04:10:52,702 --> 04:10:56,283
[SPEAKER_29]: On page 5, you have section 4 approval documentation.

1680
04:10:56,403 --> 04:11:10,065
[SPEAKER_29]: If you go down to letter D, again on page 5, letter D, it says the cost per student, if applicable, including the provision for nursing or support services.

1681
04:11:10,085 --> 04:11:15,286
[SPEAKER_29]: So again, we change counseling to support services if necessary, as well as travel insurance.

1682
04:11:16,346 --> 04:11:18,687
[SPEAKER_29]: So we believe that addresses that concern.

1683
04:11:19,947 --> 04:11:35,317
[SPEAKER_29]: And then lastly, the fifth concern that was expressed on the night of the 13th has to do with affirming, creating an affirmation statement that all field trip related forms will be posted to the school's website.

1684
04:11:35,637 --> 04:11:47,024
[SPEAKER_29]: So if you look on page nine of the document, it's the very last item, it's a letter D, and it now says all field trip related forms will be posted to the district website.

1685
04:11:48,770 --> 04:11:51,111
[SPEAKER_29]: I am happy to take any questions.

1686
04:11:51,551 --> 04:11:51,691
[SPEAKER_28]: Ms.

1687
04:11:51,731 --> 04:11:52,291
[SPEAKER_28]: Van der Kloot.

1688
04:11:53,592 --> 04:11:54,432
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Bernadette.

1689
04:11:54,692 --> 04:12:01,815
[SPEAKER_21]: So of the corrections and changes that you've made, I've noted that all the ones that I particularly had brought up, you've taken care of.

1690
04:12:02,335 --> 04:12:11,398
[SPEAKER_21]: That, of course, now being said, is my eyes lit on another line here, which I think we need to amend.

1691
04:12:11,698 --> 04:12:13,359
[SPEAKER_21]: So if you give me a second to find it.

1692
04:12:14,379 --> 04:12:20,741
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, it has to do with the notification, um, for approval or disapproval of the field trip.

1693
04:12:20,881 --> 04:12:36,187
[SPEAKER_21]: And it is on page four, uh, section three B. It reads right now, all school sponsored trips which involve overnight travel must receive prior approval of the superintendent and a vote by the Medford school committee six months prior to the trip.

1694
04:12:37,455 --> 04:12:39,996
[SPEAKER_21]: And I have to say, I know that that's totally unrealistic.

1695
04:12:40,516 --> 04:12:48,398
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that when we're thinking about it, we're thinking about all-schools concert trips, which involve overnight out-of-country travel.

1696
04:12:48,799 --> 04:12:58,762
[SPEAKER_21]: So that would be when the kids are going off to Spain or Italy or whatever, that that time frame of six months is what we would be expecting or looking for.

1697
04:12:59,827 --> 04:13:09,496
[SPEAKER_21]: But we all know that there have been other overnight trips, even including, you know, the SkillsUSA program is an overnight trip.

1698
04:13:10,176 --> 04:13:11,137
[SPEAKER_21]: We've had kids go.

1699
04:13:11,157 --> 04:13:13,119
[SPEAKER_21]: The Ethics Bowl was an overnight trip.

1700
04:13:13,599 --> 04:13:16,021
[SPEAKER_21]: Those things, there was no time to give six months.

1701
04:13:16,442 --> 04:13:20,205
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not realistic to have our policy say six months.

1702
04:13:20,725 --> 04:13:22,507
[SPEAKER_21]: So I think we need a sentence which say,

1703
04:13:25,069 --> 04:13:37,097
[SPEAKER_21]: for other field trips, you know, for other overnight trips, the school committee will be brought to the school committee for their approval.

1704
04:13:38,558 --> 04:13:39,239
[SPEAKER_21]: Using discretion.

1705
04:13:40,079 --> 04:13:42,841
[SPEAKER_21]: Using as timely, you know, I mean, it depends on the time frame.

1706
04:13:42,981 --> 04:13:45,783
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, prior discretion to the trip.

1707
04:13:46,063 --> 04:13:47,564
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, prior to the trip.

1708
04:13:47,584 --> 04:13:49,125
[SPEAKER_21]: But I mean, it has to be reasonable.

1709
04:13:49,145 --> 04:13:54,429
[SPEAKER_21]: We really don't like the last minute ones that I mean, there's a last minute one because there's an opportunity that's last minute.

1710
04:13:55,109 --> 04:13:57,873
[SPEAKER_21]: And there's a last minute one because nobody got around to telling us.

1711
04:13:57,893 --> 04:13:59,775
[SPEAKER_28]: About prior payment for the trip.

1712
04:14:00,416 --> 04:14:01,197
[SPEAKER_21]: So they have to.

1713
04:14:01,797 --> 04:14:04,861
[SPEAKER_06]: That may be tough because sound payments are generally made well in advance.

1714
04:14:05,422 --> 04:14:07,965
[SPEAKER_28]: Right, but you'd come before you do the deposit.

1715
04:14:10,097 --> 04:14:15,021
[SPEAKER_27]: Before you sign the contract, the committee should approve it.

1716
04:14:15,542 --> 04:14:28,614
[SPEAKER_25]: The only question I have about that is that sometimes, depending on our schedule, if something comes up quickly and a deposit has to be put in to hold it and we don't meet,

1717
04:14:30,051 --> 04:14:30,351
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm sorry.

1718
04:14:30,371 --> 04:14:30,751
[SPEAKER_21]: I didn't hear you.

1719
04:14:30,771 --> 04:14:31,872
[SPEAKER_21]: I didn't hear you until after well deadline.

1720
04:14:31,972 --> 04:14:39,717
[SPEAKER_21]: There is a clause which allows the superintendent to approve a trip if we don't have a meeting, Okay, so that's covered in that.

1721
04:14:40,177 --> 04:14:44,660
[SPEAKER_21]: But again, I think the first sentence needs to say overnight out of country.

1722
04:14:45,280 --> 04:14:45,660
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay um,

1723
04:14:51,985 --> 04:14:52,686
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm just trying to think.

1724
04:14:53,467 --> 04:15:00,976
[SPEAKER_21]: Other trips involving overnight travel must be must be approved by the school committee.

1725
04:15:01,977 --> 04:15:02,178
[SPEAKER_21]: Um.

1726
04:15:03,559 --> 04:15:04,981
[SPEAKER_21]: Within an appropriate time frame.

1727
04:15:05,161 --> 04:15:06,723
[SPEAKER_21]: I think we're going to need to leave it a little bit.

1728
04:15:10,147 --> 04:15:12,389
[SPEAKER_21]: unless someone else has a better wording.

1729
04:15:12,910 --> 04:15:24,020
[SPEAKER_31]: The wording is already in here, it seems like, under E. I wouldn't distinguish between out of country or in.

1730
04:15:24,540 --> 04:15:28,784
[SPEAKER_28]: Pride of payment means, well, they book it, they have to get approval from us.

1731
04:15:30,592 --> 04:15:38,959
[SPEAKER_28]: And then if there's an extreme emergency, or it comes up really short notice, like the bulls came up very short notice, then that's different.

1732
04:15:39,459 --> 04:15:41,180
[SPEAKER_25]: And that's addressed, like, outside of need.

1733
04:15:41,461 --> 04:15:44,303
[SPEAKER_29]: So prior to payment.

1734
04:15:44,363 --> 04:15:45,464
[SPEAKER_29]: Prior to payment.

1735
04:15:45,484 --> 04:15:46,885
[SPEAKER_29]: Drop at six months.

1736
04:15:51,132 --> 04:15:52,735
[SPEAKER_21]: Everyone acceptable with that?

1737
04:15:52,855 --> 04:16:01,471
[SPEAKER_21]: So you're saying all school sponsored trips which involve overnight travel must receive prior approval of the superintendent and a vote of the Medford school committee prior to payment?

1738
04:16:01,551 --> 04:16:02,413
[SPEAKER_21]: Prior to payment.

1739
04:16:02,873 --> 04:16:03,074
[SPEAKER_29]: Okay.

1740
04:16:04,628 --> 04:16:05,209
[SPEAKER_29]: I will add that.

1741
04:16:05,569 --> 04:16:06,030
[SPEAKER_29]: Change that.

1742
04:16:06,810 --> 04:16:09,834
[SPEAKER_28]: Are there any other suggestions at this point?

1743
04:16:10,194 --> 04:16:13,017
[SPEAKER_21]: Nope, that's good.

1744
04:16:13,218 --> 04:16:13,918
[SPEAKER_21]: Motion to approve.

1745
04:16:13,938 --> 04:16:14,679
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. Benedetto.

1746
04:16:14,719 --> 04:16:15,680
[SPEAKER_28]: I just had one note too.

1747
04:16:16,121 --> 04:16:17,482
[SPEAKER_26]: Mr. Benedetto.

1748
04:16:17,883 --> 04:16:21,547
[SPEAKER_26]: First of all, thank you for making all the changes I brought forward at that meeting.

1749
04:16:24,594 --> 04:16:34,502
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm just hoping that that statement about the method of public schools is committed to ensuring that the district field trips are accessible to all students.

1750
04:16:35,102 --> 04:16:47,412
[SPEAKER_26]: The policy adheres to all requirements set forth by both Section 504 Rehabilitation Act and American Disability Act meets the needs that were brought up by other people at that meeting.

1751
04:16:48,713 --> 04:16:49,453
[SPEAKER_26]: I think it does.

1752
04:16:49,613 --> 04:16:51,535
[SPEAKER_26]: I think it's very appropriate.

1753
04:16:52,115 --> 04:16:54,696
[SPEAKER_29]: So what I will say is that I did do research.

1754
04:16:54,896 --> 04:16:59,517
[SPEAKER_29]: I looked at a lot of other district policy statements.

1755
04:16:59,877 --> 04:17:04,059
[SPEAKER_29]: I looked at a lot of federal law.

1756
04:17:04,419 --> 04:17:09,220
[SPEAKER_29]: And I thought this encompassed it in a broad way, in a succinct way.

1757
04:17:09,660 --> 04:17:12,241
[SPEAKER_29]: There are volumes and volumes of information.

1758
04:17:12,261 --> 04:17:13,882
[SPEAKER_29]: There's obviously lots of case law.

1759
04:17:14,482 --> 04:17:15,542
[SPEAKER_29]: I try to be succinct.

1760
04:17:16,943 --> 04:17:19,043
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm certainly willing to be open.

1761
04:17:21,764 --> 04:17:43,872
[SPEAKER_26]: I did research And I just wanted to comment that I hope that Does meet that need and thank you for adding that in as well as making the changes I brought forward The only other thing I have is I was hoping to see an example of the form that teachers and staff would meet And I wanted to you know

1762
04:17:44,753 --> 04:17:56,743
[SPEAKER_26]: make sure that it's on online so it goes from one person gets signed off by the nurses then goes to the administration and then finally signed off by the superintendent in electronic forum format.

1763
04:17:57,003 --> 04:17:59,826
[SPEAKER_26]: So I would like to see and approve that form.

1764
04:18:00,286 --> 04:18:07,089
[SPEAKER_26]: And also an example of the medication administration slash delegation form that the district uses.

1765
04:18:07,409 --> 04:18:08,750
[SPEAKER_26]: I'd like to see that as well.

1766
04:18:08,810 --> 04:18:10,531
[SPEAKER_26]: So it's here all in one shot.

1767
04:18:10,931 --> 04:18:17,854
[SPEAKER_26]: So if parents ever want to see what's the policy, they have the sample forms, they have everything right here, part of this packet.

1768
04:18:18,394 --> 04:18:27,578
[SPEAKER_26]: So I'm asking that this be revised and brought to us with those intact, because that was what was requested at our last meeting for my notes.

1769
04:18:28,098 --> 04:18:29,019
[SPEAKER_26]: Can I ask a question?

1770
04:18:29,039 --> 04:18:32,081
[SPEAKER_29]: So we do have forms.

1771
04:18:33,142 --> 04:18:34,884
[SPEAKER_29]: There's probably 12, maybe.

1772
04:18:34,904 --> 04:18:36,245
[SPEAKER_29]: I think there are about 12 forms.

1773
04:18:36,625 --> 04:18:38,587
[SPEAKER_29]: They are still in development.

1774
04:18:38,707 --> 04:18:42,110
[SPEAKER_29]: I know that, again, Tony Vento and Gail Traynor have been working on them.

1775
04:18:42,450 --> 04:18:44,331
[SPEAKER_29]: They're very close to being finalized.

1776
04:18:44,612 --> 04:18:46,033
[SPEAKER_29]: But it's not just one or two.

1777
04:18:46,333 --> 04:18:54,640
[SPEAKER_29]: There are a lot of forms, and we're trying to make them so that they're visually easy to understand, yet substantive at the same time.

1778
04:18:55,020 --> 04:18:58,104
[SPEAKER_28]: So I'm asking to table this until we have completed.

1779
04:18:58,144 --> 04:18:59,766
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, we've asked for an amendment as well.

1780
04:18:59,926 --> 04:19:01,288
[SPEAKER_28]: So when you bring back the amendment.

1781
04:19:02,649 --> 04:19:03,330
[SPEAKER_28]: May I ask one question?

1782
04:19:03,350 --> 04:19:04,451
[SPEAKER_21]: Do you have the samples ready?

1783
04:19:04,832 --> 04:19:10,118
[SPEAKER_21]: Is there any concern about tabling this piece of it at this point?

1784
04:19:10,178 --> 04:19:12,221
[SPEAKER_21]: Is it going to hold anything up in terms of?

1785
04:19:13,322 --> 04:19:14,103
[SPEAKER_21]: We have an amendment.

1786
04:19:14,263 --> 04:19:14,444
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

1787
04:19:16,179 --> 04:19:17,440
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think it's going to hold anything up.

1788
04:19:17,480 --> 04:19:20,002
[SPEAKER_06]: You know the basic premise of the report.

1789
04:19:20,022 --> 04:19:20,663
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, okay.

1790
04:19:20,703 --> 04:19:25,666
[SPEAKER_06]: I think if we allow us to just move forward, you know, and the formalization will take place when we get back.

1791
04:19:25,686 --> 04:19:25,766
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay.

1792
04:19:25,786 --> 04:19:30,169
[SPEAKER_28]: Do you want a motion to approve subject to the amendment that we just drafted?

1793
04:19:31,010 --> 04:19:33,312
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, Erin, yes.

1794
04:19:33,632 --> 04:19:34,072
[SPEAKER_21]: I'd second.

1795
04:19:34,112 --> 04:19:42,318
[SPEAKER_21]: No, Erin wants to, what I was just asking was for clarification because Erin wants to table it at right now and hold it until we have all of it together.

1796
04:19:42,338 --> 04:19:44,720
[SPEAKER_21]: I just asked whether there was any problem with that.

1797
04:19:45,040 --> 04:19:49,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I guess, you know, we're going to have some field trips that are going to show up, you know, in the next little while.

1798
04:19:50,003 --> 04:19:54,866
[SPEAKER_06]: And if it takes a little bit longer to get everything clear, we'll be operating under some old rules.

1799
04:19:54,926 --> 04:19:59,689
[SPEAKER_06]: It might be useful to just simply say that in the main, this is an acceptable piece, understanding the amendment.

1800
04:20:00,649 --> 04:20:04,812
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, and that we provide the forms of the earliest possible time in January.

1801
04:20:06,929 --> 04:20:16,596
[SPEAKER_27]: Mayor, I would second the field trip policy we accepted tonight with inclusion of amendments at an earlier, at the latest date.

1802
04:20:17,536 --> 04:20:17,936
[SPEAKER_27]: Forms?

1803
04:20:18,257 --> 04:20:18,817
[SPEAKER_06]: Forms, yes.

1804
04:20:20,078 --> 04:20:22,620
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'll provide them to you, but at least you'll have something that's, you know.

1805
04:20:22,660 --> 04:20:24,061
[SPEAKER_26]: At least we have a policy in place.

1806
04:20:25,192 --> 04:20:26,733
[SPEAKER_26]: The forms need to be approved.

1807
04:20:26,793 --> 04:20:49,403
[SPEAKER_26]: I want them district-wide this specific thing So it's hard to approve something based on without having everything at one point I do like everything is in here that we need in here, but I How long would it take to get the forms to us and be presented we have a lot of meetings coming up I mean They have to be k-12

1808
04:20:50,985 --> 04:20:53,186
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't know if there's anything else you would like to add to that.

1809
04:20:53,307 --> 04:20:54,387
[SPEAKER_29]: They are created.

1810
04:20:54,607 --> 04:20:56,608
[SPEAKER_29]: I think they might need a little bit more tweaking.

1811
04:20:56,749 --> 04:20:58,029
[SPEAKER_29]: We have been working on that.

1812
04:20:58,149 --> 04:21:01,031
[SPEAKER_29]: Perhaps Beverly has something to add to that.

1813
04:21:01,812 --> 04:21:03,012
[SPEAKER_19]: The forms were done.

1814
04:21:03,092 --> 04:21:04,313
[SPEAKER_19]: They just aren't organized.

1815
04:21:04,373 --> 04:21:10,016
[SPEAKER_19]: When we got the forms, they were so voluminous that they were just very hard for people to deal with.

1816
04:21:10,417 --> 04:21:12,298
[SPEAKER_19]: So I know Tony, we've been working at it.

1817
04:21:12,358 --> 04:21:15,259
[SPEAKER_19]: We just, it will take more time to get it.

1818
04:21:18,868 --> 04:21:25,675
[SPEAKER_19]: And again, I'm a little concerned about dragging this out because people are looking for guidance, the administration, the principals.

1819
04:21:25,695 --> 04:21:27,477
[SPEAKER_19]: We have a meeting tomorrow with principals.

1820
04:21:27,517 --> 04:21:32,102
[SPEAKER_19]: We'd like to be able to say we have a policy guide so that we don't keep going on.

1821
04:21:32,783 --> 04:21:35,566
[SPEAKER_19]: The forms, again, it's an organizational piece.

1822
04:21:35,847 --> 04:21:36,768
[SPEAKER_19]: It's trying to

1823
04:21:37,515 --> 04:21:42,599
[SPEAKER_19]: make them customer friendly, and it should not really be anything.

1824
04:21:42,739 --> 04:21:43,720
[SPEAKER_19]: Point of information.

1825
04:21:43,860 --> 04:21:47,383
[SPEAKER_28]: Mr. Skerry, point of information.

1826
04:21:47,403 --> 04:21:47,443
[SPEAKER_28]: Ms.

1827
04:21:47,603 --> 04:21:51,206
[SPEAKER_27]: Nelson, can we have those forms by the 18th to satisfy the needs of this board?

1828
04:21:52,447 --> 04:21:53,087
[SPEAKER_19]: I think so.

1829
04:21:53,147 --> 04:21:58,792
[SPEAKER_19]: Tony, you said we've been revising, we've been working on it, we just don't have it perfect.

1830
04:21:59,773 --> 04:22:00,113
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

1831
04:22:00,493 --> 04:22:03,556
[SPEAKER_19]: In terms of, there are medical forms, okay, it's kind of,

1832
04:22:04,542 --> 04:22:05,603
[SPEAKER_19]: a cascading effect.

1833
04:22:05,623 --> 04:22:13,908
[SPEAKER_19]: There's the preliminary forms that everybody's going to have to do, and then what comes into play is another set of forms for children that have medical issues.

1834
04:22:14,669 --> 04:22:21,033
[SPEAKER_19]: So we need to make it so that people understand they don't have to fill out 20 forms when it doesn't apply.

1835
04:22:21,513 --> 04:22:28,598
[SPEAKER_19]: And so that's what we're struggling with now, trying to make this concise, make it applicable to the particular trip.

1836
04:22:29,279 --> 04:22:32,741
[SPEAKER_19]: And we don't want, because we know what happens when you put a whole bunch of papers out,

1837
04:22:33,206 --> 04:22:34,887
[SPEAKER_19]: People just look at it and say, I can't do this.

1838
04:22:35,127 --> 04:22:35,827
[SPEAKER_19]: It's just too much.

1839
04:22:36,187 --> 04:22:38,168
[SPEAKER_19]: So we're trying to make it customer friendly.

1840
04:22:38,708 --> 04:22:47,131
[SPEAKER_19]: But again, the policy, the form should really not, I mean, we can get them to you, but I'd like to move forward with this if we could.

1841
04:22:47,151 --> 04:22:49,072
[SPEAKER_26]: Mr. Benedetto, follow up on this?

1842
04:22:49,212 --> 04:22:50,532
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes, please.

1843
04:22:50,832 --> 04:22:55,654
[SPEAKER_26]: So the form I'm looking at is the application to go on the field trip.

1844
04:22:55,914 --> 04:23:01,236
[SPEAKER_26]: Not so much all the forms that all parents have to do, but even the application form.

1845
04:23:01,736 --> 04:23:10,963
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, I want to take my second grade class to apple picking at, you know, small farms.

1846
04:23:11,543 --> 04:23:22,352
[SPEAKER_26]: And so I'm going to go online, I'm going to fill this out, it's going to go to the nurse, and it's going to go to my head, you know, my principal and the superintendent for approval.

1847
04:23:23,416 --> 04:23:24,677
[SPEAKER_26]: That's the type of form I want.

1848
04:23:24,697 --> 04:23:25,397
[SPEAKER_26]: From the teacher.

1849
04:23:25,677 --> 04:23:26,398
[SPEAKER_26]: From everyone.

1850
04:23:26,458 --> 04:23:31,941
[SPEAKER_26]: And I want it tracked, so I want to know, I want data next year saying, this is where they went.

1851
04:23:32,941 --> 04:23:38,344
[SPEAKER_26]: This grade over here went on five field trips, whereas this school over here hasn't.

1852
04:23:38,424 --> 04:23:41,486
[SPEAKER_26]: And maybe as a district, we might want to help them.

1853
04:23:42,126 --> 04:23:44,507
[SPEAKER_26]: or, you know, I want that data.

1854
04:23:44,527 --> 04:23:53,148
[SPEAKER_26]: So that's the form that I, I don't need every single form at this point, but I want, when you roll this out, okay, here's our new thing, and this is how you apply.

1855
04:23:53,668 --> 04:23:54,809
[SPEAKER_26]: I want it to go with it.

1856
04:23:55,309 --> 04:23:55,929
[SPEAKER_26]: If you just do that one.

1857
04:23:55,949 --> 04:23:57,229
[SPEAKER_26]: So the form that starts the process.

1858
04:23:57,889 --> 04:24:05,871
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think, too, Erin, you may have mentioned last time at the meeting a checklist of things that, the checklist, I think we added one thing to the checklist.

1859
04:24:05,911 --> 04:24:11,072
[SPEAKER_19]: So we have the checklist, we have the preliminary form, it's just that we really want to make

1860
04:24:11,584 --> 04:24:21,828
[SPEAKER_19]: everything else, and it can be a lot of forms, depending upon the youngsters who are going on the trip, something that people aren't going to look at and say, I'm not going to go on the trip because I don't want to fill out the forms.

1861
04:24:22,288 --> 04:24:24,769
[SPEAKER_19]: That would be the last thing we want to do on that.

1862
04:24:25,150 --> 04:24:31,052
[SPEAKER_19]: We can do the checklist, and we can do just the preliminary application.

1863
04:24:31,718 --> 04:24:53,608
[SPEAKER_25]: clarification on motion point of information yeah um there is i mean i know there's a large group of that have computers but there's also a large group out there that doesn't and so i just want to make sure i'm you know not everything translates from on-site to actually had copy as easily

1864
04:24:54,688 --> 04:24:58,853
[SPEAKER_25]: So when we're doing this online, are we doing them in different languages?

1865
04:24:59,214 --> 04:25:03,099
[SPEAKER_26]: This is just for teachers to fill out an application to take the class.

1866
04:25:03,199 --> 04:25:04,701
[SPEAKER_25]: OK, that's where the clarification is.

1867
04:25:04,881 --> 04:25:07,064
[SPEAKER_25]: You're not talking about the parent filling it out.

1868
04:25:07,124 --> 04:25:10,488
[SPEAKER_25]: You're actually just talking about the teacher filling it out.

1869
04:25:10,508 --> 04:25:11,049
[SPEAKER_19]: That's a process.

1870
04:25:11,129 --> 04:25:14,870
[SPEAKER_19]: There will be a parent permission form that will be part of the package.

1871
04:25:15,270 --> 04:25:19,952
[SPEAKER_19]: But I think at this point we're talking about what's the checklist.

1872
04:25:20,692 --> 04:25:31,575
[SPEAKER_19]: A lot of this has stemmed from the fact that teachers would begin to plan trips, begin to fundraise, begin to get kids excited without the principal knowing.

1873
04:25:31,835 --> 04:25:34,716
[SPEAKER_19]: And then there were all kinds of repercussions after the fact.

1874
04:25:34,736 --> 04:25:37,757
[SPEAKER_19]: So this was really initially an attempt to make sure that

1875
04:25:38,598 --> 04:25:41,739
[SPEAKER_19]: before people start the process, they know what the process has to be.

1876
04:25:42,259 --> 04:25:44,700
[SPEAKER_19]: And so that was where this was originated from.

1877
04:25:44,720 --> 04:25:46,941
[SPEAKER_28]: Could you repeat the motion?

1878
04:25:48,522 --> 04:25:49,602
[SPEAKER_28]: There's two separate ones.

1879
04:25:49,662 --> 04:25:55,165
[SPEAKER_28]: One's a motion to accept the policy with the one amendment that was made a little earlier.

1880
04:25:55,685 --> 04:26:00,167
[SPEAKER_28]: And then Erin asked that the whole policy not be accepted until we have the forms.

1881
04:26:00,847 --> 04:26:03,608
[SPEAKER_28]: She's now specified it's the start form.

1882
04:26:04,188 --> 04:26:05,709
[SPEAKER_28]: But to me, the policy

1883
04:26:06,755 --> 04:26:12,039
[SPEAKER_28]: dictates and the forms can come and they can be changed as things change in life.

1884
04:26:12,680 --> 04:26:22,048
[SPEAKER_28]: So I would ask that we approve the policy so that we can get it out to the principals, especially at your meeting tomorrow, and then we can get the forms at our next meeting.

1885
04:26:23,249 --> 04:26:28,894
[SPEAKER_19]: We can get those two forms to you next time, but we won't have the opportunity to meet with the principals again until January.

1886
04:26:29,354 --> 04:26:31,376
[SPEAKER_19]: So if we had this to them tomorrow, it would be helpful.

1887
04:26:32,130 --> 04:26:32,270
[SPEAKER_31]: Ms.

1888
04:26:32,310 --> 04:26:32,570
[SPEAKER_31]: Kreatz.

1889
04:26:34,411 --> 04:26:36,692
[SPEAKER_31]: I had a similar question about the forms.

1890
04:26:36,732 --> 04:26:47,575
[SPEAKER_31]: I just wanted to know, are the forms going to be available to the teachers with the Google Doc documents where they can go in and add their information and move it along?

1891
04:26:47,895 --> 04:26:49,756
[SPEAKER_31]: Because I think that was discussed at the last meeting.

1892
04:26:50,997 --> 04:26:58,244
[SPEAKER_30]: At the committee of the whole about the field trip, there was a number of parents from the CPAC organization.

1893
04:26:58,745 --> 04:27:06,793
[SPEAKER_30]: Did you reach out to them to ask them if this was, I don't, they spoke about the language they were looking for that made them feel confident that we were being equitable.

1894
04:27:07,374 --> 04:27:08,395
[SPEAKER_30]: So is that possible?

1895
04:27:08,415 --> 04:27:12,579
[SPEAKER_30]: I think the chairperson said, could you reach out to me with language, I could help you with language.

1896
04:27:13,380 --> 04:27:25,916
[SPEAKER_19]: Right, we basically, as Bernadette said, she did the research, but we also worked with Kathy Medaglia, who looked at this for me and thought that this would be something that would cover all of those instances, so we feel that it does.

1897
04:27:27,688 --> 04:27:28,589
[SPEAKER_21]: There's a motion on the floor.

1898
04:27:28,629 --> 04:27:28,789
[SPEAKER_21]: Ms.

1899
04:27:28,809 --> 04:27:29,249
[SPEAKER_21]: Van der Kloot.

1900
04:27:29,510 --> 04:27:35,075
[SPEAKER_21]: So you're going to kill me, but I'm going back to this line about approval.

1901
04:27:35,855 --> 04:27:37,337
[SPEAKER_21]: And you just said something.

1902
04:27:37,357 --> 04:27:48,226
[SPEAKER_21]: You said that what happened in the past is that teachers started, you know, advertising to the kids that they were going to go on this and they got everybody all excited and they might even start raising money.

1903
04:27:49,067 --> 04:27:51,469
[SPEAKER_21]: And that has nothing to do with payment.

1904
04:27:52,648 --> 04:28:06,294
[SPEAKER_21]: So if we're saying that when we want to approve the trip, if you're waiting, saying, well, we only need to approve it with payment, that means that teacher can already be advertising it and they can be raising money.

1905
04:28:06,534 --> 04:28:09,716
[SPEAKER_21]: Payment is not the word that you want there.

1906
04:28:09,956 --> 04:28:11,896
[SPEAKER_19]: So we're dealing with which, come on back.

1907
04:28:12,157 --> 04:28:15,818
[SPEAKER_19]: So this is page four, number three.

1908
04:28:19,480 --> 04:28:21,941
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's, yes, right here.

1909
04:28:23,081 --> 04:28:30,115
[SPEAKER_19]: All school-sponsored trips involve overnight, out-of-state travel must receive prior approval to protect.

1910
04:28:30,135 --> 04:28:32,680
[SPEAKER_28]: They need to figure out if people are even interested in going.

1911
04:28:34,599 --> 04:28:36,180
[SPEAKER_28]: They have to pull their students.

1912
04:28:36,281 --> 04:28:39,143
[SPEAKER_28]: If no one wants to go, they're not going to come to us and ask for approval.

1913
04:28:39,163 --> 04:28:42,166
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm not sure what they are.

1914
04:28:42,186 --> 04:28:42,526
[SPEAKER_29]: Right?

1915
04:28:42,606 --> 04:28:49,532
[SPEAKER_29]: So what you're saying is that it should not be prior to payment, that we need to take that out.

1916
04:28:49,813 --> 04:28:53,236
[SPEAKER_29]: Moments ago, you suggested that we add that in prior to payment.

1917
04:28:53,316 --> 04:28:54,177
[SPEAKER_21]: I didn't suggest payment.

1918
04:28:54,197 --> 04:28:54,737
[SPEAKER_21]: Someone else did.

1919
04:28:54,757 --> 04:28:54,857
[SPEAKER_21]: I did.

1920
04:28:55,418 --> 04:28:55,698
[SPEAKER_21]: OK?

1921
04:28:55,758 --> 04:28:59,922
[SPEAKER_21]: And I suggested that what we were doing was saying that the teacher was going

1922
04:29:01,343 --> 04:29:06,733
[SPEAKER_21]: I think if there's an overnight trip, um, uh, to the school district, I think it's a good idea to have an overnight trip.

1923
04:29:09,961 --> 04:29:16,087
[SPEAKER_21]: within the United States that we want two months notice, maybe three months notice.

1924
04:29:16,107 --> 04:29:31,961
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, I'm saying, and then I'm putting in a clause and saying if an opportunity arises for students that is, you know, underneath this timeframe, that approval can be given by the superintendent with notification to the school committee.

1925
04:29:33,234 --> 04:29:35,194
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, that's how I would line it out.

1926
04:29:35,254 --> 04:29:38,775
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, because payment, I think is, I think payment is arbitrary.

1927
04:29:38,915 --> 04:29:41,056
[SPEAKER_19]: And there are some trips that we're not going to require payment.

1928
04:29:41,136 --> 04:29:42,556
[SPEAKER_19]: Some of the out of overnight trips.

1929
04:29:42,576 --> 04:29:42,676
[SPEAKER_19]: Right.

1930
04:29:42,696 --> 04:29:48,578
[SPEAKER_21]: So just recently, the Italian come with this opportunity to go to New York.

1931
04:29:48,618 --> 04:29:48,858
[SPEAKER_21]: Right.

1932
04:29:49,118 --> 04:29:51,158
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, that was being funded by someone else.

1933
04:29:51,178 --> 04:29:51,338
[SPEAKER_19]: Right.

1934
04:29:51,518 --> 04:29:52,079
[SPEAKER_19]: Exactly.

1935
04:29:52,199 --> 04:29:58,860
[SPEAKER_19]: So maybe in a timely way, overnight trips, other overnight trips must be approved in a timely way.

1936
04:29:58,880 --> 04:30:02,361
[SPEAKER_19]: Because we do have things that happen very quickly, like that New York trip.

1937
04:30:03,098 --> 04:30:05,005
[SPEAKER_19]: others we have several months doing.

1938
04:30:05,045 --> 04:30:08,598
[SPEAKER_19]: So if we just put it in a timely way and we leave it kind of discretionary.

1939
04:30:10,543 --> 04:30:16,625
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you need to be careful not to overregulate, because what happens is that circumstances change, situations change.

1940
04:30:17,146 --> 04:30:27,470
[SPEAKER_06]: What you're really saying to us, be responsible, be reasonable, keep us informed, make things, you know, don't let people go run amok and go too far down the road before, you know, you know about it.

1941
04:30:27,490 --> 04:30:29,671
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that's really what we're basically saying to people.

1942
04:30:29,711 --> 04:30:35,313
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think, you know, we've got professionals on staff, they've got to understand that that means give us the information in a timely way.

1943
04:30:36,013 --> 04:30:41,797
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Superintendent, do I dare remind you that just last week we were approving a field trip.

1944
04:30:41,817 --> 04:30:44,059
[SPEAKER_21]: We had a new administrator.

1945
04:30:44,859 --> 04:30:47,682
[SPEAKER_06]: We also had a full month where we didn't hold a meeting.

1946
04:30:48,302 --> 04:30:52,165
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's really, you know, that was really a circumstantial thing, but that's a typical.

1947
04:30:52,905 --> 04:30:54,226
[SPEAKER_21]: Let me just ask the committee.

1948
04:30:54,586 --> 04:31:03,813
[SPEAKER_21]: If we're talking about foreign trips out of the country to Italy, to Honduras, wherever it is, how much time does the committee want to know in advance to approve that?

1949
04:31:03,833 --> 04:31:04,674
[SPEAKER_27]: 90 days.

1950
04:31:06,434 --> 04:31:06,795
[SPEAKER_21]: 90 days.

1951
04:31:07,115 --> 04:31:08,156
[SPEAKER_21]: Here it said six months.

1952
04:31:09,178 --> 04:31:11,260
[SPEAKER_19]: We usually bring those to you pretty early.

1953
04:31:11,280 --> 04:31:16,226
[SPEAKER_19]: I just don't want to be in a situation where there might be an opportunity for our students to do something.

1954
04:31:24,036 --> 04:31:33,798
[SPEAKER_25]: And then because the teacher then looks down and looks at the policy and says, oh, geez, it wasn't within the two weeks or it wasn't within the three weeks or seven months.

1955
04:31:33,938 --> 04:31:35,138
[SPEAKER_19]: What if they don't even bring it?

1956
04:31:35,638 --> 04:31:40,199
[SPEAKER_19]: What if we kept it six months unless there are extenuating circumstances?

1957
04:31:40,359 --> 04:31:41,119
[SPEAKER_28]: That's fine.

1958
04:31:41,340 --> 04:31:42,440
[SPEAKER_19]: That's fine.

1959
04:31:42,480 --> 04:31:44,940
[SPEAKER_28]: Discretionary.

1960
04:31:45,460 --> 04:31:48,421
[SPEAKER_19]: Six months unless there are extenuating circumstances.

1961
04:31:49,764 --> 04:31:51,265
[SPEAKER_19]: That leaves some flexibility.

1962
04:31:51,345 --> 04:31:58,750
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, so I think you should do three months because I think Wait, the six months was for foreign travel, right?

1963
04:31:58,830 --> 04:32:07,096
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, if you're saying just a general blanket, then and the kids are going to Cape Cod, we're not asking for six months time.

1964
04:32:07,796 --> 04:32:15,742
[SPEAKER_19]: No, the regular overnight in domestic trips, I thought we said would be in a timely way because those are going to

1965
04:32:16,457 --> 04:32:17,177
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it's reasonable.

1966
04:32:17,217 --> 04:32:19,678
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it's reasonable for them to pop up quickly or they may be longer.

1967
04:32:19,698 --> 04:32:20,958
[SPEAKER_19]: I think those have been a timely way.

1968
04:32:21,318 --> 04:32:25,879
[SPEAKER_19]: The six months, um, is the international I think is reasonable.

1969
04:32:26,019 --> 04:32:26,399
[SPEAKER_19]: Most people.

1970
04:32:26,619 --> 04:32:29,459
[SPEAKER_19]: Most of those trips are planned a year in advance for the most part.

1971
04:32:29,740 --> 04:32:30,300
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

1972
04:32:30,420 --> 04:32:31,380
[SPEAKER_19]: That's good.

1973
04:32:31,420 --> 04:32:37,841
[SPEAKER_28]: So as amended now motion for approval of the policy as amended on the floor seconded by Mr

1974
04:32:43,137 --> 04:32:43,577
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1975
04:32:43,617 --> 04:32:44,037

[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1977
04:32:44,337 --> 04:32:44,678
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

04:32:53,441 --> 04:32:53,961
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

1993
04:32:54,001 --> 04:32:54,301
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

1994
04:32:54,321 --> 04:32:54,701
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

1995
04:32:54,721 --> 04:32:54,941
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

1996
04:32:54,961 --> 04:32:55,301
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

1997
04:33:07,304 --> 04:33:12,648
[SPEAKER_28]: Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee extend condolences to the family of Sandra Toomey who passed away Tuesday.

1998
04:33:12,748 --> 04:33:17,291
[SPEAKER_28]: Mrs. Toomey was a dedicated community activist and active in Medford public education.

1999
04:33:17,391 --> 04:33:21,434
[SPEAKER_28]: She is survived by husband Bill and son Thomas and daughter-in-law Kathleen.

2000
04:33:22,315 --> 04:33:28,959
[SPEAKER_28]: Also be it further resolved that the Medford School Committee send condolences to the family of Margaret Regan, a longtime teacher at the Swan School.

2001
04:33:29,600 --> 04:33:32,442
[SPEAKER_28]: If we could all rise for a moment of silence please on the passing of these two.

2002
04:33:34,654 --> 04:33:37,796
[SPEAKER_28]: Citizens.

2003
04:33:44,181 --> 04:33:44,501
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

2004

[SPEAKER_31]: Does the motion that this meeting be adjourned?

2005
04:33:51,078 --> 04:33:54,998
[SPEAKER_31]: I have one very quick announcement.

2006
04:33:55,098 --> 04:33:57,939
[SPEAKER_31]: I just want to make one quick announcement.

[SPEAKER_31]: There are several Medford High School students who created a new educational series.
