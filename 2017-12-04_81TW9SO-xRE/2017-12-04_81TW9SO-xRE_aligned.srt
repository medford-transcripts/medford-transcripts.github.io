1
00:02:45,179 --> 00:02:45,241
you

2
00:06:58,736 --> 00:07:03,762
in the wake of the region's illegal declaration of independence have been freed on bail by a Spanish court.

3
00:07:04,282 --> 00:07:10,028
The judge, however, refused bail to some, including Catalonia's former deputy leader, Oriol Junqueras.

4
00:07:10,609 --> 00:07:11,470
Gavin Lee reports.

5
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:21,080
This evening, four of the ex-Catalan ministers were driven away from Estremera prison close to Madrid, cheered on by dozens of independent supporters waiting at the prison gates.

6
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:24,941
Two female ex-ministers were also released earlier from a women's prison.

7
00:07:25,341 --> 00:07:34,503
They were all ordered to pay Â£90,000 each in bail and still face possible charges of sedition and rebellion against the state, one of the most serious crimes in Spain.

8
00:07:35,343 --> 00:07:39,584
Two independence activists and two other ex-ministers have been ordered to remain in custody.

9
00:07:40,144 --> 00:07:46,465
One of them, Ariel Junqueras, is widely tipped as a candidate for president if the separatist parties win the regional elections.

10
00:07:47,265 --> 00:07:52,368
The judge ruled that they had been responsible for instigating violence in the run-up to the independence declaration.

11
00:15:27,455 --> 00:15:38,958
He'd been in an alliance with Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in the country's bloody civil war before seeking talks with a Saudi-led coalition that wants to reinstate the internationally recognized government.

12
00:15:39,479 --> 00:15:43,400
Mr Saleh ruled the country for more than three decades before being overthrown in 2012.

13
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:50,102
And as Frank Gardner reports, his death is being described by the Houthis as a victory against their enemies.

14
00:15:51,422 --> 00:15:58,867
A historic day for Yemen, said the leader of the Houthi rebels who have taken over the capital.

15
00:15:59,587 --> 00:16:01,168
Others are calling it disastrous.

16
00:16:01,649 --> 00:16:10,334
Yemen's former strongman president and wily power broker, Ali Abdullah Saleh, was killed today by the very rebels he joined forces with for the last three years.

17
00:16:10,934 --> 00:16:11,374
The reason?

18
00:16:11,815 --> 00:16:17,078
He just switched sides, abandoning the Houthis and making peace overtures to their archenemies.

19
00:23:46,846 --> 00:23:54,386
The conduct was unacceptable and a country acting in that manner should not be allowed to participate in the next games.

20
00:23:55,993 --> 00:24:06,398
England's cricketers have given themselves the faintest of chances of an unlikely win after leaving Australia on 53-4 in their second innings at the close of the third day's play in the second Ashes Test.

21
00:24:06,898 --> 00:24:11,900
Earlier, England had been dismissed for 227 in their first innings.

22
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:18,463
It means Australia currently have a lead of 268 runs in that day-night test in Adelaide.

23
00:24:18,783 --> 00:24:22,305
The BBC's cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew has sent us this report.

24
00:24:22,845 --> 00:24:30,491
A disappointing batting performance by England swung the game Australia's way, but their bowlers fought back under the lights to give them an outside chance of an upset.

25
00:24:30,932 --> 00:24:42,021
Finding a fuller length and prodigious movement, Anderson, Broad and Wokes swung and seamed the ball in both directions to claim four wickets, while Smith, reprieved once by technology, fell LBW to Wokes for six.

26
00:24:42,661 --> 00:24:46,042
However, the fact remains that England gifted Australia their commanding lead.

27
00:24:46,482 --> 00:24:52,603
Vince and Root fell cheaply to slip catches, Cook made 37 before edging Lyon, and Milan gloved to the keeper for 19.

28
00:24:52,683 --> 00:25:03,345
Moeen scored 25 and Bairstow 21 before the only substantial stand of the innings, 66 between Wokes and Overton, before Lyon claimed the final two wickets.

29
00:25:03,745 --> 00:25:07,046
The pink ball has thrown England a lifeline, and they have to take it.

30
00:25:08,482 --> 00:25:14,044
So England's bowlers have regained some form after struggling to contain the Australian batsmen in their first innings.

31
00:25:14,564 --> 00:25:20,486
Chris Wokes then took two Australian second innings wickets, and he's been pleased with the new bowling results.

32
00:25:20,966 --> 00:25:22,127
Well, we fought back nicely.

33
00:25:22,147 --> 00:25:29,189
Obviously, we're still behind in the game, but it's good to see us fight back, show some really good character to come out here and bowl well tonight and put them under some pressure.

34
00:25:29,489 --> 00:25:35,411
As I mentioned there, we probably could have had a better day with the bat and got close to them, but it's nice to see us come out there and

35
00:33:04,763 --> 00:33:06,164
But first, the latest world news.

36
00:33:08,446 --> 00:33:10,188
BBC News with Jonathan Isard.

37
00:33:10,588 --> 00:33:18,174
A dispute over the status of the Irish border has scuppered efforts by Britain and the European Union to move on to the second phase of their negotiations on Brexit.

38
00:33:18,554 --> 00:33:28,262
The British Prime Minister Theresa May apparently broke off talks after the main party in Northern Ireland, the DUP, said it would not support a deal which gave significant concessions to the Irish Republic.

39
00:33:29,102 --> 00:33:29,543
The U.S.

40
00:33:29,583 --> 00:33:37,012
Supreme Court has ruled that the latest version of President Trump's travel ban can be implemented in full, pending continuing legal challenges in lower courts.

41
00:33:37,452 --> 00:33:40,676
The ban, in its third version, restricts travel to the U.S.

42
00:33:40,736 --> 00:33:42,759
by people from six mainly Muslim countries.

43
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:44,501
Lower courts had already allowed

44
00:34:18,509 --> 00:34:20,371
the size of two protected U.S.

45
00:34:20,431 --> 00:34:21,851
Federal Reserves in Utah.

46
00:34:22,352 --> 00:34:29,456
He intends to scale back Bear Ears National Monument by about 85 percent and cut another area by about 50 percent.

47
00:34:30,057 --> 00:34:36,201
Native American leaders who campaigned for the creation of the Bear Ears Monument say they will challenge the decision in court.

48
00:34:37,429 --> 00:34:45,316
An investigation by South Africa's anti-corruption body has found more than $20 million were misappropriated during preparations for Nelson Mandela's funeral.

49
00:34:45,837 --> 00:34:47,959
Funds meant for poor communities were spent on...

50
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:33,116
have so what are investors watching for now what is the next thing which you think will send the market higher or lower well we still of course have to have a resolution of the two different versions of this bill that were passed so that that's going to be occupying people here over the next few weeks

51
00:42:33,936 --> 00:42:38,818
We also have some funding issues for the government that they do not have a budget in place.

52
00:42:39,258 --> 00:42:42,199
And there's a deadline coming up for that toward the end of this week.

53
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:47,561
Everyone expects that that will be extended at least to the end of December and possibly into January.

54
00:42:47,641 --> 00:42:51,703
But there's always a possibility of a hiccup as you get right down to the deadline.

55
00:42:51,783 --> 00:42:56,665
So it definitely is a period that's going to be dominated by developments out of Washington, D.C.

56
00:42:57,608 --> 00:43:00,992
Peter Jankowskis there in the US, where the Dow closed up 0.2% at 24,290.

57
00:43:01,092 --> 00:43:05,198
And at the end of the day, in London, the 100 share index was up half a percentage point at 73.41.

58
00:43:12,864 --> 00:43:20,647
Now the social network Facebook is trying to recruit some new members by launching a messaging app for children as young as six.

59
00:43:20,887 --> 00:43:26,709
The app is designed with controls that allow parents to decide who their children can connect to online.

60
00:43:27,149 --> 00:43:34,351
The firm is promising a safe space for the young amid fears over cyberbullying and the availability of inappropriate material.

61
00:43:34,671 --> 00:43:36,352
Kate Roof is from the website.

62
00:51:05,512 --> 00:51:05,892
the gym.

63
00:51:06,552 --> 00:51:11,674
I asked him what he thought when he was told that he would be managing people who used to live on the street.

64
00:51:11,954 --> 00:51:23,639
I was nervous because we know people come from the street, they can steal things, they can do many things out of the families.

65
00:51:23,819 --> 00:51:31,942
Now, as the gym has grown and succeeded, even with an admittedly very difficult to train staff, Rafael says he's learned a lot.

66
00:51:32,182 --> 00:51:34,684
It's not easy to work with these people.

67
00:51:36,866 --> 00:51:40,268
The first thing we have to show them is a laugh, unconditional laugh.

68
00:51:40,669 --> 00:51:44,592
It's not easy to laugh at someone who sometimes can hit you.

69
00:51:45,192 --> 00:51:55,300
It's not easy to stay with someone you don't know who he is, but we open the gates for them and then

70
00:59:24,628 --> 00:59:29,219
Not being depressed or down about it, but assuming that... Obviously, you must live a very anxious life.

71
00:59:29,239 --> 00:59:30,061
Well, no, not at all.

72
00:59:30,121 --> 00:59:32,286
I think I'd be much more anxious if I wasn't like that.

73
00:59:32,306 --> 00:59:33,849
I think you've got to have people who are...

74
01:07:02,725 --> 01:07:06,888
Yemeni capital Sana'a hours after the former president Ali Abdullah Saleh was killed.

75
01:07:07,368 --> 01:07:12,091
Houthi rebel fighters have been celebrating the death of Mr. Saleh, who until last week was their ally.

76
01:07:12,632 --> 01:07:20,857
The Houthis killed him as he was trying to flee Sana'a in a convoy after days of fierce fighting between the former allies that have left more than 125 people dead.

77
01:07:21,438 --> 01:07:28,202
The current president, Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi, who is in Saudi Arabia, has urged Yemenis to rise up against the Houthis.

78
01:07:28,562 --> 01:07:32,045
The UN says that humanitarian flights into Sana'a have been suspended.

79
01:07:33,246 --> 01:07:41,412
An investigation by South Africa's anti-corruption body has found that more than $20 million were misappropriated during preparations for Nelson Mandela's funeral.

80
01:07:41,893 --> 01:07:45,336
Mr Mandela, South Africa's first black president, died four years ago.

81
01:07:45,356 --> 01:07:46,597
Here's Andrew Harding.

82
01:15:21,343 --> 01:15:27,925
As you do at the head of Oxfam International, you can have a powerful lobbying voice, but you can't pull the levers of power.

83
01:15:28,185 --> 01:15:38,788
Whereas if you chose a political career, and goodness knows, back home in Uganda, there are many people who think that you would have a very strong chance of political success.

84
01:15:39,248 --> 01:15:43,269
If you did, you could then pull the levers of power yourself.

85
01:15:43,769 --> 01:15:50,475
Political leaders can only be as good as the people, the citizens, are active.

86
01:15:50,915 --> 01:16:01,864
It is so important that we raise the voice of citizens, that we support citizens to hold their leaders accountable and to hold business accountable for good practice.

87
01:16:02,504 --> 01:16:16,754
So what I'm doing now, today, is leading a global organization that fuels, that powers movements on the ground of citizens to push their governments to be just and to deliver to them.

88
01:16:16,855 --> 01:16:24,800
Let's just focus on what you've said about your role, which is very much about political messages, about campaigning, about activism.

89
01:16:25,161 --> 01:16:31,225
But what you didn't say was that it's also about delivering very real and urgent humanitarian

90
01:23:59,961 --> 01:24:09,406
are very important and they are growing, and it's important though to understand that aid, even though it's one part, has a very important part to play.

91
01:24:10,267 --> 01:24:15,710
Take the 47 fragile countries, 47 of them fragile, poor countries.

92
01:24:16,170 --> 01:24:20,052
For those, aid is the largest aid flow externally.

93
01:24:20,192 --> 01:24:21,273
They need that aid.

94
01:24:21,973 --> 01:24:41,400
What about those economists who say that aid given to those very poorest countries often props up governments whose record on governance and striving for economic efficiency and delivering real economic benefits to their people is horrible and that aid sustains them?

95
01:24:42,942 --> 01:24:58,325
There is a point in what you say, because aid should be used for purposes of strengthening the institutions of government and strengthening the capacity of citizens to hold governments accountable.

96
01:24:58,685 --> 01:25:06,547
So the purpose of aid is important, that it is channeled to the poorest who are not reached by markets, who are not reached by private

97
01:25:06,647 --> 01:25:20,914
capital, that it is used to strengthen tax collection so that countries get on their feet and raise enough resources, that it is used to support the strengthening of civil society voices to hold governments accountable.

98
01:25:21,275 --> 01:25:29,279
We have to use aid for those purposes, for it to deliver the autonomy, financial autonomy that governments want.

99
01:25:29,779 --> 01:25:39,133
There's one specific thing I want to put to you which has come out into the open in recent days as a result, bizarrely, of a scandal in the United States concerning Harvey Weinstein and...

100
01:33:08,993 --> 01:33:10,774
BBC News with Jonathan Isard.

101
01:33:11,194 --> 01:33:19,336
The US Supreme Court has ruled that the latest version of President Trump's travel ban can be implemented in full, pending continuing legal challenges in lower courts.

102
01:33:19,736 --> 01:33:25,218
The ban, in its third version, restricts travel to the US by people from six mainly Muslim countries.

103
01:33:25,738 --> 01:33:29,719
Lower courts had already allowed a ban on certain people from North Korea and Venezuela.

104
01:33:30,699 --> 01:33:37,166
President Trump has announced plans to substantially reduce the size of two preservation areas in Utah known for their natural beauty.

105
01:33:37,586 --> 01:33:45,694
He intends to scale back Bear Ears National Monument by about 85% and cut another area, Grand Staircase Escalante, by about 50%.

106
01:33:46,675 --> 01:33:49,017
Native American leaders say they'll challenge the decision.

107
01:33:50,058 --> 01:33:57,601
A dispute over the status of the Irish border has scuppered efforts by Britain and the European Union to move on to the second phase of their negotiations on Brexit.

108
01:33:58,122 --> 01:34:08,486
The British Prime Minister, Theresa May, apparently broke off talks after the main party in Northern Ireland, the DUP, said it would not support a deal which gave significant concessions to the Irish Republic.

109
01:41:37,193 --> 01:41:40,016
The community before used to be white people.

110
01:41:40,236 --> 01:41:43,579
It was a library for only a few houses that were in the area.

111
01:41:44,600 --> 01:41:46,782
It's just in between two suburbs.

112
01:41:47,402 --> 01:41:49,564
So that's why the library was small at that time.

113
01:41:49,624 --> 01:41:50,525
It was built in 1947.

114
01:41:52,407 --> 01:41:55,189
But nowadays, that area has changed.

115
01:41:55,890 --> 01:41:59,533
It's got more than 1,000 people that are staying in the area.

116
01:42:00,666 --> 01:42:04,707
The houses are so many than before, but the library is still small.

117
01:42:05,347 --> 01:42:07,388
And how big is your collection?

118
01:42:08,108 --> 01:42:08,648
Roughly?

119
01:42:08,828 --> 01:42:12,769
Not that big, my dear, because I'm still struggling when I need other things.

120
01:42:13,349 --> 01:42:15,489
It's just according to the building.

121
01:42:15,949 --> 01:42:22,171
Because even if I wish to have much more, I wouldn't be able to keep it in the library because the library is very small.

122
01:42:22,731 --> 01:42:31,715
Colin, I'm curious, do members of the public, just regular readers, do you find that they come to the Library of Congress or does it tend to be people come to visit?

123
01:42:31,735 --> 01:42:36,278
It's a combination because it's a tourist destination.

124
01:50:05,985 --> 01:50:25,843
book that will inspire them or give them an insight into the human condition that you say you understand that you may be going through things and other people have gone through things and they've made it and that's very helpful when young people are facing so many challenges.

125
01:50:26,964 --> 01:50:27,224
Yes.

126
01:50:27,284 --> 01:50:33,247
And, Carla, can I ask you, in terms of books that you connected with when you were a kid, is there one particular book that you can remember?

127
01:50:33,267 --> 01:50:40,391
Well, there's one that I've talked about quite a bit, and it meant so much to me in that storefront library across the street.

128
01:50:41,171 --> 01:50:50,816
Someone, and I'm sure it was a librarian, put in my hand a book called Bright April, and it was the first time I saw myself reflected in a book.

129
01:50:51,497 --> 01:50:54,899
It was a little girl about the same age, eight years old.

130
01:50:55,119 --> 01:50:55,679
She had two

131
01:58:21,732 --> 01:58:22,933
So I would just sort of...

132
01:58:59,375 --> 01:59:00,456
Hi again, how are we?

133
01:59:02,978 --> 01:59:12,487
Christine, what's the average amount that the school lunch program takes in on a daily basis?

134
01:59:12,887 --> 01:59:15,249
Yeah, I know, we're a little different.

135
01:59:15,610 --> 01:59:16,771
Do I have the time?

136
01:59:16,791 --> 01:59:17,772
Okay, no problem.

137
01:59:17,852 --> 01:59:19,493
I was just curious to see what's up.

138
01:59:19,773 --> 01:59:23,337
Is it coming out of the $10,000 Jeff gave us, or is that extra?

139
01:59:24,097 --> 01:59:24,678
Excellent.

140
01:59:57,642 --> 01:59:59,263
Can I get you to move down just a little?

141
02:00:01,243 --> 02:00:01,643
Thank you.

142
02:00:01,663 --> 02:00:02,304
A little more.

143
02:00:02,864 --> 02:00:04,384
A little more.

144
02:00:05,605 --> 02:00:05,985
That's it.

145
02:00:06,065 --> 02:00:08,666
Are you sure you don't want me out in the parking lot now?

146
02:00:08,686 --> 02:00:09,126
No, that's good.

147
02:00:09,586 --> 02:00:11,427
I can go out in the parking lot if you want me to.

148
02:00:11,447 --> 02:00:11,987
Thank you.

149
02:00:12,147 --> 02:00:13,427
No problem.

150
02:00:24,329 --> 02:00:26,770
So Erin is down at the zoning meeting.

151
02:00:26,890 --> 02:00:29,271
They should have a larger table for us.

152
02:00:29,371 --> 02:00:30,151
It's crazy.

153
02:00:30,171 --> 02:00:31,132
Yeah, I know.

154
02:00:31,172 --> 02:00:32,653
I think we need longer tables.

155
02:00:32,693 --> 02:00:33,253
Hi, Sebastian.

156
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:58,363
I guess I didn't read this because I went down to... What happened, was it dark?

157
02:00:58,383 --> 02:01:00,285
No, they're having a zoning meeting there.

158
02:01:00,666 --> 02:01:00,806
Oh.

159
02:01:00,846 --> 02:01:01,527
What are they trying to do?

160
02:01:18,935 --> 02:01:22,698
So we did not know, realize that the top here, we didn't catch that.

161
02:01:44,850 --> 02:01:45,350
Nope.

162
02:01:45,671 --> 02:01:49,113
I meant to ask you because I remember now after the fact.

163
02:01:49,173 --> 02:01:52,375
Unfortunately, it's heating through Medford Square right now.

164
02:01:52,455 --> 02:01:54,096
It's hard to, well it is close to go home.

165
02:02:15,470 --> 02:02:17,331
When we're here, it's hard to see across.

166
02:02:17,371 --> 02:02:18,652
Well, you can start without me.

167
02:02:42,987 --> 02:02:44,169
No, they're on the way.

168
02:02:44,189 --> 02:02:49,436
Erin is attending the meeting, but Anne-Marie are coming.

169
02:02:49,576 --> 02:02:52,160
Yeah, I'd give them a little bit of time.

170
02:02:52,300 --> 02:02:57,648
It was tough to get through because of the, you know, all the cones and the police.

171
02:03:13,834 --> 02:03:15,435
It's December, Bob, it's December.

172
02:03:15,515 --> 02:03:18,037
Who is Eunice Brown?

173
02:03:18,057 --> 02:03:18,698
Do you know her?

174
02:03:18,838 --> 02:03:19,678
Oh, tell me about her.

175
02:03:19,718 --> 02:03:21,660
Yeah, so you and I are relics.

176
02:03:21,700 --> 02:03:23,761
She's gonna find herself in court.

177
02:03:40,271 --> 02:03:42,252
And then she called us relics.

178
02:03:42,413 --> 02:03:42,973
I was so mad.

179
02:03:43,193 --> 02:03:46,455
She didn't have too many nice things to say about me.

180
02:03:46,555 --> 02:03:49,518
She should do her homework before she puts things on the internet.

181
02:03:49,558 --> 02:03:50,598
She's so good for you.

182
02:03:50,618 --> 02:03:52,259
Straighten this teacher a lesson.

183
02:03:52,380 --> 02:03:55,762
I've never heard of her before this election.

184
02:03:55,802 --> 02:03:58,284
She's not registered to vote.

185
02:03:58,424 --> 02:03:59,224
Are you serious?

186
02:03:59,244 --> 02:03:59,605
Yes.

187
02:04:12,232 --> 02:04:13,273
Why don't we just put that out?

188
02:04:13,333 --> 02:04:15,235
She might not be in, for all I know.

189
02:04:15,275 --> 02:04:17,938
I don't know if she's an American citizen or not.

190
02:04:18,698 --> 02:04:20,300
I just know that she just- I don't know the woman.

191
02:04:20,320 --> 02:04:21,982
I'd like to know what she looks like.

192
02:04:22,022 --> 02:04:22,782
I can't tell you.

193
02:04:22,842 --> 02:04:23,623
I've never met her.

194
02:04:24,464 --> 02:04:31,691
You and I, because we're old, we're automatically, she called us relics, she called us many things.

195
02:04:32,251 --> 02:04:34,874
She keep her mouth shut.

196
02:04:34,894 --> 02:04:35,675
She's not a taxpayer.

197
02:04:36,783 --> 02:04:37,003
What?

198
02:04:37,163 --> 02:04:40,826
I gotta tell you, she doesn't own any property either.

199
02:04:41,526 --> 02:04:43,788
She just became like all of a sudden that way.

200
02:04:43,928 --> 02:04:46,390
That Medford Politics page is just insane.

201
02:04:54,491 --> 02:04:55,912
I'm trying to salvage the note.

202
02:05:23,850 --> 02:05:28,153
You know what I'll do?

203
02:05:28,193 --> 02:05:29,473
There's not much here.

204
02:05:29,614 --> 02:05:30,534
I'll turn this, okay?

205
02:05:30,634 --> 02:05:30,994
All right.

206
02:05:31,054 --> 02:05:31,535
Right here.

207
02:05:31,575 --> 02:05:32,455
Really, why?

208
02:05:32,535 --> 02:05:35,016
I'm hanging around.

209
02:05:35,176 --> 02:05:36,357
Yeah, seriously, why?

210
02:05:46,289 --> 02:05:50,693
Real estate taxes are ridiculous.

211
02:05:50,793 --> 02:05:53,135
Well, you could downsize easily.

212
02:05:53,615 --> 02:05:55,537
And your house is probably worth a lot.

213
02:05:55,857 --> 02:05:59,220
Yeah, that's why I want to strike while the strike is good.

214
02:06:13,291 --> 02:06:17,438
Well, if you want to go, we've got a lot of committee of the whole minute, so.

215
02:06:17,458 --> 02:06:18,920
All right.

216
02:06:19,200 --> 02:06:20,182
Do we have a quorum?

217
02:06:21,404 --> 02:06:22,205
That's where I can roll.

218
02:06:23,086 --> 02:06:25,831
All right.

219
02:06:25,871 --> 02:06:28,194
Regular meeting of Memphis School Committee will now come to order.

220
02:06:29,380 --> 02:06:30,802
The secretary will call the roll.

221

Yeah.

This is Van der Kloot.

279
02:08:28,580 --> 02:08:28,881
Yes.

280
02:08:29,021 --> 02:08:29,541
Mayor Burke.

281
02:08:29,741 --> 02:08:30,022
Yes.

282
02:08:30,402 --> 02:08:32,624
I did the affirmative to absent motion passes.

283
02:08:37,370 --> 02:08:41,574

02:08:49,901 --> 02:08:50,882
If you wanted to summarize it.

286
02:08:51,142 --> 02:08:54,725
Okay, so this was the Committee of the Whole of November 13th.

287
02:08:54,945 --> 02:08:56,467
I don't know, do we need to?

288
02:08:56,987 --> 02:08:57,408
Can you hear me?

289
02:08:58,949 --> 02:08:59,269
Okay.

290
02:08:59,549 --> 02:08:59,870
Hold tight.

291
02:09:03,912 --> 02:09:10,655
And present at the meeting were Mayor Burke, Vice Chair Anne Marie Cuneo, Arenda Benedetto, Kathy Kretz, Mia McStone, Robert Scurry, and myself.

292
02:09:11,115 --> 02:09:14,776
Also attending was Michael Ruggiero and Paul Rousseau, school committee members left.

293
02:09:15,416 --> 02:09:27,561
Also present were the following Deputy Superintendent Beverly Nelson, Assistant Superintendent Diane Caldwell, Director of Pupil Services Kathleen Medaglio, Director of Curriculum Bernadette Scurry.

294
02:09:29,190 --> 02:09:53,938
uh, Director of Finance and Administration, Kirsteen Patterson, Director of Foreign Language, Rita DeCarlo, Supervisor of Health Services, Tony Vento, Assistant Athletic Director, Rachel Perry, um, Headmaster, John Perrella, Principal, Paul DeLeva, Principal, Jacob Edwards, Assistant Principal, Nick Tucci, Athletic Trainer, Tanya Cashman, Tim Zitt, Registrar, Curtis Tootin, and other community members, including Tammy Simenotis,

295
02:09:54,598 --> 02:10:01,083
uh, Marie Petrides, Angela Moore, David Lu, Melanie McLaughlin, Tanya Sullivan, and Jameel Webb Davis.

296
02:10:01,463 --> 02:10:04,145
Transcript recorder Miranda Wilson was also in attendance.

297
02:10:05,326 --> 02:10:15,274
Um, the mayor, uh, the, the meeting was called, uh, to discuss school brains, the field trip policy, follow up on student concussions, and report on the North Medford bus.

298
02:10:15,654 --> 02:10:17,956
It was a very substantial meeting, went on for hours.

299
02:10:18,736 --> 02:10:24,562
Um, I just added that Superintendent Johnson made the following remarks the evenings.

300
02:10:24,742 --> 02:10:28,366
Um, and by the way, sorry, it was there was a there was mistake.

301
02:10:28,446 --> 02:10:30,108
It should be Bernadette Riccadeli.

302
02:10:30,768 --> 02:10:33,191
Uh, so we addressed the four different issues.

303
02:10:34,092 --> 02:10:42,500
Um, and the first item was the report of the North Medford bus capacity and ridership, uh, director of administration and finance Christine Patterson gave the

304
02:10:42,600 --> 02:10:43,981
report and it's attached.

305
02:10:44,601 --> 02:10:48,564
And Principal Tucci verified the report.

306
02:10:48,924 --> 02:10:57,710
There are two buses coming from North Medford in the morning and in the afternoon there are between 45 to 50 riders daily which is within its capacity.

307
02:10:58,270 --> 02:11:00,272
At this time there's no need to add another bus.

308
02:11:00,752 --> 02:11:04,475
administration will keep the committee informed as demand increases.

309
02:11:04,695 --> 02:11:06,957
The next item was student concussions.

310
02:11:07,338 --> 02:11:09,780
Um, we talked about this at length.

311
02:11:10,460 --> 02:11:16,926
Um, as part of our discussions, parent Tammy Simonotis spoke of her son's experience at Beverly High School.

312
02:11:17,066 --> 02:11:24,212
She asserted that her son was injured during a JV soccer game and that there was inadequate trainer medical coverage by the Beverly staff.

313
02:11:24,732 --> 02:11:27,815
She believes that the Beverly schools did not have a certified trainer at the game.

314
02:11:28,296 --> 02:11:30,940
Her son suffered a head injury, chipped teeth and nosebleeds.

315
02:11:31,261 --> 02:11:33,745
The concern focused upon safety at away games.

316
02:11:37,478 --> 02:11:44,720
Members of our staff spoke with the athletic director at Beverly, but really haven't received any more news.

317
02:11:46,561 --> 02:11:52,742
Mrs. Simone was pleased with how Medford handles injuries, but was very upset at the Beverly response.

318
02:11:54,783 --> 02:11:59,864
Concern was particularly high because the game was allowed to go on after the injury took place.

319
02:12:00,885 --> 02:12:05,466
The superintendent promised that he will be conferring with the MIA regarding this matter.

320
02:12:06,326 --> 02:12:15,733
The next item under discussion was the field trip policy and administrators Paul Deliva, Tony Vento and Kathy Medaglio contributed comments during the discussions.

321
02:12:17,034 --> 02:12:24,740
CPAC chairperson Melanie McLaughlin raised equity issues about the policy and commented that CPAC should have been consulted as the policy was formulated.

322
02:12:26,622 --> 02:12:32,646
There was a discussion about the annual trip to New York by the Andrew School and the questions about deadlines.

323
02:12:36,049 --> 02:12:46,938
Among the 90 students who attended, there were 19 students who either had an IEP or 504 plan, and this was 19% of the participants.

324
02:12:48,860 --> 02:12:54,145
If we had added another bus, it would have cost approximately $7,500 and would not have made the trip doable.

325
02:12:55,140 --> 02:12:55,280
Ms.

326
02:12:55,320 --> 02:13:02,804
McLaughlin asserted that the trip excluded students with disabilities and that every trip should be planned to serve all interested students.

327
02:13:03,425 --> 02:13:04,766
The issue raised several points.

328
02:13:05,226 --> 02:13:09,989
Can field trips be planned with application deadlines if those deadlines are applicable to all students?

329
02:13:10,629 --> 02:13:13,671
Should field trips be limited if the economics cannot be balanced?

330
02:13:14,131 --> 02:13:18,774
And should the cost of medical services be shared by all participants or subsidized by the school system?

331
02:13:19,634 --> 02:13:21,716
After continued discussion, the policy was tabled.

332
02:13:21,736 --> 02:13:24,979
Administrators will bring forward a revised policy that addresses the issues.

333
02:13:25,659 --> 02:13:27,701
The final issue of the evening was school brains.

334
02:13:28,321 --> 02:13:33,666
Headmaster Perella and Data Information Specialist Registrar Curtis Tudin gave us a report.

335
02:13:35,067 --> 02:13:40,851
The headmaster reported that changes had been made to address the GPA concerns raised during the spring by Mr. David Lu.

336
02:13:41,272 --> 02:13:45,075
Mr. Tudin provided a chart that showed the increase in usage by parents and teachers.

337
02:13:45,575 --> 02:13:46,957
More will be done going forward.

338
02:13:47,237 --> 02:13:49,380
This is a work in progress, but it is moving forward.

339
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:53,224
Mr. Liu was still skeptical about the accuracy of the reporting system.

340
02:13:53,624 --> 02:13:56,348
He revisited his concerns from last spring.

341
02:13:56,748 --> 02:13:58,931
Administrators asserted that the changes would work.

342
02:13:59,211 --> 02:14:01,854
The school committee asked to be informed as the year progressed.

343
02:14:02,284 --> 02:14:06,369
The meeting was adjourned at ten oh five respectfully submitted Paulette Vander Kloot secretary.

344
02:14:06,909 --> 02:14:07,189
Very good.

345
02:14:07,230 --> 02:14:08,311
Thank you Miss Vander Kloot.

346
02:14:09,392 --> 02:14:09,812
Miss Kretz.

347
02:14:10,033 --> 02:14:11,815
Yes, um, Superintendent Belson.

348
02:14:11,895 --> 02:14:13,256
I just wanted to follow up with you.

349
02:14:13,697 --> 02:14:19,824
Um, I was in touch with Miss Simonides and I just wanted to know if something was filed with the M.I.A.A.

350
02:14:20,284 --> 02:14:21,545
regarding the incident.

351
02:14:22,066 --> 02:14:23,648
If you've had a chance to file that yet.

352
02:14:24,853 --> 02:14:29,035
Okay, so I have had substantial contact with the Beverly Public Schools.

353
02:14:29,796 --> 02:14:33,658
They strongly dispute the account provided to us by Ms.

354
02:14:34,138 --> 02:14:34,718
Simonides.

355
02:14:35,639 --> 02:14:38,540
I've gone back and forth with Stephen Hershey, who is the superintendent there.

356
02:14:39,641 --> 02:14:46,605
He claims, and he gave me the name of the trainer, the certified trainer who was on the field at that time.

357
02:14:46,685 --> 02:14:51,407
He said that no trainer from Beverly did anything with the individual.

358
02:14:54,449 --> 02:14:58,595
As a result, he feels that it may have been somebody else who just simply helped out on the sidelines.

359
02:14:59,256 --> 02:15:00,457
So I have a lot more to do.

360
02:15:00,477 --> 02:15:07,647
I did contact the MIAA briefly and told them that we're in the process of continuing to investigate what actually took place.

361
02:15:08,308 --> 02:15:09,310
But there is a distinct

362
02:15:10,591 --> 02:15:15,615
difference of opinion between what Beverly feels happened and what was reported to us.

363
02:15:16,236 --> 02:15:21,260
So there's a little bit going on right now and I'll have more reports soon as I get a better chance to talk to all the parties.

364
02:15:21,720 --> 02:15:27,225
The feeling from Beverly was that somebody assisted the student but not necessarily the trainer and that

365
02:15:28,906 --> 02:15:34,289
The play was allowed to go forward without any reason to stop the play.

366
02:15:34,610 --> 02:15:45,856
So there's back and forth, but Beverly strongly refutes the idea that their trainer assisted our student and also that the trainer was not licensed.

367
02:15:46,097 --> 02:15:48,118
And they gave me the name and showed me the licensure.

368
02:15:48,902 --> 02:15:51,284
did you communicate that information to the parent?

369
02:15:52,024 --> 02:15:53,365
Not yet.

370
02:15:53,445 --> 02:15:54,386
This is still going back.

371
02:15:54,446 --> 02:15:56,688
In fact, the latest communication was as late as today.

372
02:15:56,708 --> 02:15:58,189
I'm Stephen Hershey.

373
02:15:58,829 --> 02:16:01,111
So I've got a lot more work to do.

374
02:16:01,171 --> 02:16:04,153
I mean, obviously, there's a real difference of opinion in what took place.

375
02:16:04,934 --> 02:16:08,997
So you got the name and the person is not certified?

376
02:16:09,117 --> 02:16:10,218
They are.

377
02:16:10,838 --> 02:16:12,179
I actually have it on my phone.

378
02:16:12,219 --> 02:16:13,500
I can give it to you afterwards.

379
02:16:15,934 --> 02:16:27,317
I guess that would raise the question to me is if our kids are playing and a student got hurt, why wasn't our student cared for by the trainer who was there?

380
02:16:27,557 --> 02:16:39,180
According to the Beverly Public Schools, since the referee didn't stop the play, obviously he didn't consider it serious enough and that for some reason, you know,

381
02:16:40,416 --> 02:16:42,477
that the assistance was done on the sidelines.

382
02:16:42,757 --> 02:16:48,120
They suspect that somebody who maybe had a nursing background or something else like that may have helped on the sidelines.

383
02:16:48,140 --> 02:16:52,023
The question is, why did the youngster go back in the game, too, if he had a kick in the head?

384
02:16:52,043 --> 02:16:54,044
There are a couple of questions that still have to be answered.

385
02:16:54,444 --> 02:17:03,689
And if the student, I believe the parent, told us that the student was bleeding, so why would the, I mean, we already talked about why didn't the referee stop the game?

386
02:17:04,049 --> 02:17:08,352
Yeah, well, according to them, they didn't believe the referee needed to stop the game.

387
02:17:08,832 --> 02:17:14,719
And secondly, you know, and without casting any aspersions on anyone, as you know, Mississimini's was not at the game.

388
02:17:15,300 --> 02:17:21,688
And so as a result, we have a situation where people who were at the game have very different reports as to what took place there.

389
02:17:22,096 --> 02:17:31,100
Yes, but certainly blood is blood and if well, that's that's uh, you know an assumption that was made as to when the bleeding took place and who did what and where and I need more information.

390
02:17:31,120 --> 02:17:44,805
I mean, obviously we have a back and forth going on and I asked uh, Stephen Hershey who's the again superintendent of Beverly um, because mississippianities was contacting the Beverly school committee and others up in Beverly and uh,

391
02:17:45,706 --> 02:17:48,349
They are siding with the Beverly public schools right now.

392
02:17:48,369 --> 02:18:02,385
So I you know, I need a lot more Feeling as to what's really took place point of information man The superintendent has the game officials committee been contacted to find out who the referee was and I asked I asked for that information I haven't got it back yet.

393
02:18:02,405 --> 02:18:05,289
Okay Also, have you spoke to the coach?

394
02:18:06,129 --> 02:18:07,809
I didn't speak to the coach, but Mr Maloney did.

395
02:18:08,710 --> 02:18:10,270
And so I'm going to get a follow up on that.

396
02:18:10,310 --> 02:18:18,472
But again, today's information, which I just got today, is a direct refutation of the story we got.

397
02:18:19,113 --> 02:18:21,433
And so I really need to ask a lot of questions.

398
02:18:21,613 --> 02:18:21,773
Right.

399
02:18:21,893 --> 02:18:25,834
But we do have the student who this happened to.

400
02:18:26,194 --> 02:18:28,535
And we could have a follow up with the student.

401
02:18:28,555 --> 02:18:33,356
I just don't know when it happened, how it happened, and the like.

402
02:18:33,376 --> 02:18:35,057
I have two very different reports.

403
02:18:36,823 --> 02:18:37,003
Ms.

404
02:18:37,023 --> 02:18:37,464
Konyo.

405
02:18:39,267 --> 02:18:53,066
When you find out from Beverly, or when you continue discussions with Beverly, could you find out, were they filming the game to see, you know, what type of play happened out there, or was there anyone filming the game to see what type of

406
02:18:54,247 --> 02:18:55,208
I don't know.

407
02:18:55,388 --> 02:18:56,569
I don't do a film in the J.V.

408
02:18:56,589 --> 02:18:59,290
game and they may have filmed the varsity game but I don't think from the J.V.

409
02:18:59,350 --> 02:18:59,530
game.

410
02:18:59,731 --> 02:19:01,652
Well sometimes it depends on the schools.

411
02:19:01,872 --> 02:19:03,013
You might do it if the kids.

412
02:19:03,253 --> 02:19:05,474
It could be someone else that just had their Facebook.

413
02:19:05,494 --> 02:19:06,155
Not their Facebook.

414
02:19:06,175 --> 02:19:06,995
Their cell phone.

415
02:19:07,435 --> 02:19:08,356
And were filming too.

416
02:19:09,116 --> 02:19:14,480
Just to see what type of play and if there is something out there that at least we could see what happened.

417
02:19:14,580 --> 02:19:16,101
And as my colleague said I mean.

418
02:19:17,702 --> 02:19:29,335
You know, especially when you're out there, I know the first thing is, is that when someone goes down and there is blood, especially if there's blood, that's the first thing that the student, the player is asked to step off the field.

419
02:19:31,030 --> 02:19:45,135
Let me let me if I can mirror let me let me read you the latest communication from Stephen Hershey Because I'm putting on my cell phone and they'll give you an idea of you know, the strength of his comment It wasn't like I don't think anything happened.

420
02:19:45,655 --> 02:19:49,377
It's very very, you know direct So let me read it to you.

421
02:19:49,397 --> 02:19:51,317
So you're digging while you're getting that up.

422
02:19:51,878 --> 02:19:54,459
Mr. Turangali our student representative sure

423
02:19:55,985 --> 02:20:05,229
Um, a lot of the danger behind concussions is the lack of education that goes with it, um, and especially on the part of the coaches.

424
02:20:06,009 --> 02:20:18,635
Um, and if the student does not know to take themselves out of the game, um, um, they'll put themselves at risk for a second damage to the brain, um, which is far worse than the first.

425
02:20:19,455 --> 02:20:25,418
Um, so possibly, um, if we're thinking about our own education policy in the future and keeping our own kids safe,

426
02:20:26,324 --> 02:20:38,276
I think this is a great example to show that we should push for Medford coaches to be aware of concussions in the game.

427
02:20:38,547 --> 02:20:40,228
points of information they are very.

428
02:20:41,569 --> 02:20:43,990
Just to address the street alleys.

429
02:20:45,071 --> 02:20:47,372
The question of the discussion actually.

430
02:20:47,432 --> 02:20:51,594
In my in my came out with a question.

431
02:20:52,635 --> 02:20:53,015
Cushion.

432
02:20:53,796 --> 02:20:55,617
Policy and a probably about.

433
02:20:56,517 --> 02:20:58,958
Six years since Mitchell's been gone so about six years ago.

434
02:20:59,819 --> 02:21:04,602
That everyone had to go through it the ironic part is that actually I argued with the referee.

435
02:21:05,402 --> 02:21:05,842
to go through it.

436
02:21:05,882 --> 02:21:11,825
And I think it's important for them to call themselves their organization because there is a policy out there that everyone has to go through.

437
02:21:12,285 --> 02:21:14,166
And that is the coaches have to go through it.

438
02:21:14,507 --> 02:21:15,887
Administration has to go through it.

439
02:21:15,927 --> 02:21:17,108
The students have to go through it.

440
02:21:17,468 --> 02:21:18,829
The parents have to go through it.

441
02:21:19,189 --> 02:21:23,131
And at that point in time, and, of course, athletic directors had to go through it.

442
02:21:24,051 --> 02:21:28,834
Nurses the only ones at that point in time that didn't have to go through it with the

443
02:21:33,796 --> 02:22:00,471
uh... fought long and hard enough it finally came true and the referees have also have to go through it and um... just to give you a quick policy on that when a student has a concussion our athletic trainer actually before the season begins tests all our children and there's a certain way of testing them through the concussion uh... strategies that they have if by any chance a child does get hurt on the field then that child has to go back

444
02:22:00,731 --> 02:22:01,491
to that trainer.

445
02:22:01,932 --> 02:22:02,972
Gets evaluated.

446
02:22:03,312 --> 02:22:04,653
Has to go to a doctor.

447
02:22:05,133 --> 02:22:13,557
Will not be placed on that field again, not only with the clearance of a doctor, not only with the clearance of the nurses, but also with the clearance of the trainer.

448
02:22:13,877 --> 02:22:18,800
And let me tell you, our trainer, she doesn't care which doctor clears you, you will not get on that field.

449
02:22:19,500 --> 02:22:21,901
unless that trainer okays you.

450
02:22:22,481 --> 02:22:26,342
And unfortunately, this was a situation that happened prior to that.

451
02:22:27,222 --> 02:22:28,183
It happened on the field.

452
02:22:28,223 --> 02:22:33,284
It happened away, you know, in experiences of, I'm going to say, on everyone.

453
02:22:33,644 --> 02:22:36,285
You know, I understand that the student wanted, the player wanted to get back.

454
02:22:36,885 --> 02:22:38,566
And, you know, it's like everything else.

455
02:22:38,786 --> 02:22:42,592
player always wants to get back but we as adults have to take responsibility too.

456
02:22:42,953 --> 02:22:46,198
I'm not blaming the coach, I'm not blaming our team, I'm not blaming anybody.

457
02:22:46,518 --> 02:22:52,528
I'm just saying that there's certain things that we need to make decisions upon and now the superintendent is working with them.

458
02:22:53,208 --> 02:23:03,356
So I don't want to draw any conclusions until I have more investigation, but let me read you what Stephen Hershey wrote me today, and then attach some additional information which I'm exploring with others.

459
02:23:03,416 --> 02:23:03,876
Good afternoon.

460
02:23:03,896 --> 02:23:05,657
I'm sending you copies of what I have in addition.

461
02:23:05,677 --> 02:23:07,539
Your athletic director sent a letter to us.

462
02:23:07,619 --> 02:23:11,082
I spoke with several Beverly parents I know usually attend the games.

463
02:23:11,182 --> 02:23:15,345
While some of them remember the play, they do not report it as a significant injury.

464
02:23:15,905 --> 02:23:18,908
They note that there was no stoppage of play, nor the issuance of a card.

465
02:23:19,429 --> 02:23:24,433
Our trainer's name is Charla Berenas, and she has been with us for a long time without complaint.

466
02:23:24,914 --> 02:23:29,258
Beverly has taken this seriously from the start, but I have been unable to verify what has been reported.

467
02:23:29,779 --> 02:23:33,382
Our coaches and trainer are expected to deal with potential concussions with great caution.

468
02:23:33,943 --> 02:23:38,147
We perform ongoing training to ensure we are attending to the safety of all athletes under our own

469
02:23:39,068 --> 02:23:40,149
our players from other teams.

470
02:23:40,529 --> 02:23:41,710
I would like to find out what happened.

471
02:23:41,730 --> 02:23:43,571
Please forward me any information you have.

472
02:23:44,132 --> 02:23:46,094
So, we have an ongoing investigation.

473
02:23:46,794 --> 02:23:51,618
You know, I can't draw a conclusion, you know, without more discussion with people.

474
02:23:51,919 --> 02:24:01,687
This came through today, and we've got a little bit more to follow up, and I just don't want to draw conclusions until I'm comfortable that everyone has a chance to review the information back and forth.

475
02:24:02,668 --> 02:24:05,570
We'll mark it for a report, follow-up report on our agenda?

476
02:24:05,770 --> 02:24:05,951
Yes.

477
02:24:07,279 --> 02:24:11,182
And is there a motion to accept this committee of the whole report from November 13th?

478
02:24:11,262 --> 02:24:12,363
Oh, actually amended.

479
02:24:12,423 --> 02:24:13,864
I was not present at this meeting.

480
02:24:14,064 --> 02:24:14,825
Okay, second.

481
02:24:15,385 --> 02:24:17,307
And you can add me to the chair.

482
02:24:19,768 --> 02:24:20,509
I had you to it.

483
02:24:20,589 --> 02:24:21,190
Yeah, I wasn't.

484
02:24:21,230 --> 02:24:22,170
Yeah, I was present.

485
02:24:22,250 --> 02:24:24,452
Okay.

486
02:24:25,593 --> 02:24:27,975
Is there a motion for acceptance of the report as amended?

487
02:24:27,995 --> 02:24:31,077
So I just seconded by Mr. Scary.

488
02:24:31,177 --> 02:24:31,918
All those in favor?

489
02:24:31,938 --> 02:24:32,318
Aye.

490
02:24:32,598 --> 02:24:33,299
All those opposed?

491
02:24:34,019 --> 02:24:34,720
Motion passes.

492
02:24:36,144 --> 02:24:38,046
The Committee of the Whole from November 15th.

493
02:24:38,466 --> 02:24:40,027
We do not have that report yet.

494
02:24:40,248 --> 02:24:44,431
I'd ask that one of my colleagues table this Committee of the Whole report.

495
02:24:44,451 --> 02:24:46,273
So moved by Mr. Benedetto.

496
02:24:46,633 --> 02:24:47,674
Seconded by Mr. Skerry.

497
02:24:47,694 --> 02:24:48,415
All those in favor?

498
02:24:48,695 --> 02:24:48,815
Aye.

499
02:24:49,196 --> 02:24:49,816
All those opposed?

500
02:24:49,836 --> 02:24:50,957
That paper is tabled.

501
02:24:51,618 --> 02:24:53,159
Committee of the Whole, Minutes from November 27th, 2017.

502
02:24:57,321 --> 02:25:04,525
This was a meeting that we held last week in order to discuss the succession plan for our superintendent of schools.

503
02:25:06,166 --> 02:25:07,247
We had the Mass.

504
02:25:07,267 --> 02:25:09,188
Association of School Committees present.

505
02:25:09,268 --> 02:25:15,811
He presented quite a brochure to us on strategies that we should use in our deliberations.

506
02:25:16,952 --> 02:25:21,294
Ultimately, the Medford School Committee voted on the following matters in Committee of the Whole.

507
02:25:22,635 --> 02:25:27,278
that the MASC, Mass Associated School Committee, will provide a sample brochure to us.

508
02:25:28,059 --> 02:25:32,081
The school committee will also explore other search consultants before making a selection.

509
02:25:32,782 --> 02:25:35,324
The school committee voted to review internal candidates first.

510
02:25:35,364 --> 02:25:36,624
That was a 7-0 vote.

511
02:25:37,285 --> 02:25:42,769
And the school committee voted to meet again on December 11, 2017 to continue its work.

512
02:25:43,469 --> 02:25:48,713
We also had quite a bit of discussion around a search committee if we ultimately do go outside.

513
02:25:48,773 --> 02:25:51,775
What was explained to us is if we do internal candidates,

514
02:25:52,735 --> 02:25:55,657
It would be school committee interviewing in a public session.

515
02:25:56,457 --> 02:26:02,641
If from there we go to a full search, a nationwide search, let's say, we would form a committee.

516
02:26:02,941 --> 02:26:21,133
And the complement of that committee would be set up of three teachers from the different levels of schooling, one administrator, one student, school committee members, suggested was three, and also community members being parents.

517
02:26:21,693 --> 02:26:29,076
And we also wanted to make sure that we included all subgroups such as special ed and ELL in those check boxes.

518
02:26:29,116 --> 02:26:31,117
So we're working on an actual application.

519
02:26:31,497 --> 02:26:37,059
For those out there, we're working on a formal application that people can fill out and submit back to us if they have an interest.

520
02:26:37,599 --> 02:26:40,940
Also, I ask that our diversity director be a member of this committee.

521
02:26:41,420 --> 02:26:43,281
It was voted on in seven to zero.

522
02:26:43,381 --> 02:26:44,862
So thank you all for that.

523
02:26:45,482 --> 02:26:48,683
And we will be meeting next week to discuss this further on December 11th.

524
02:26:49,043 --> 02:26:50,404
Mr. Superintendent, is that up here?

525
02:26:51,084 --> 02:26:52,765
Yes, that is in the high school.

526
02:26:52,785 --> 02:26:53,785
It will be in the conference room.

527
02:26:54,866 --> 02:26:58,648
Is there a motion to accept this report and place it on file to accept the report, please?

528
02:26:58,668 --> 02:27:01,729
Motion to accept by Mr No seconded by Mr Scary.

529
02:27:01,749 --> 02:27:02,570
All those in favor.

530
02:27:03,410 --> 02:27:04,151
All those opposed.

531
02:27:04,291 --> 02:27:05,051
Motion passes.

532
02:27:06,212 --> 02:27:07,592
Community participation.

533
02:27:07,652 --> 02:27:10,394
Miss Retta Smith regarding the school breakfast program.

534
02:27:11,074 --> 02:27:12,575
Mia, did you want to say a few words or no?

535
02:27:13,255 --> 02:27:13,715
Go read it.

536
02:27:17,464 --> 02:27:21,608
You've been handed a report tonight that was prepared, that was sent to us.

537
02:27:21,648 --> 02:27:28,074
So on our desk is a report on the 2017 breakfast participation rates as well as some literature.

538
02:27:29,896 --> 02:27:30,877
Good evening everyone.

539
02:27:31,657 --> 02:27:35,861
So I was asked to present some information on the school breakfast program.

540
02:27:36,262 --> 02:27:42,888
So I am a registered dietitian and I am the nutritionist for the food services department for Medford Public Schools.

541
02:27:43,628 --> 02:27:47,311
Just some general information, we offer breakfast at all of our schools.

542
02:27:47,951 --> 02:27:53,535
Most of them, it's traditional style offered before school begins in the cafeteria.

543
02:27:54,436 --> 02:27:58,899
Three of them offer breakfast free of charge for any student interested.

544
02:27:59,500 --> 02:28:07,546
One of those three has breakfast not in the cafeteria before school, but in the classroom after the bell, and it counts as learning time.

545
02:28:08,622 --> 02:28:21,077
So if you look at the sheet that has the breakfast participation rates, if you look at the last column, the percent ADP, so the percentage of average daily participation, it ranges from 0% to 86 almost percent.

546
02:28:21,097 --> 02:28:22,699
So this really shows the

547
02:28:26,543 --> 02:28:29,464
drastic variance in participation rates.

548
02:28:29,984 --> 02:28:36,626
So the Columbus, the McGlynn Elementary, and Middle School all are offering universally free breakfasts.

549
02:28:37,326 --> 02:28:51,931
So if you take a look at just those three using the October 2017 data, the McGlynn Elementary School had almost 29% participation, the Middle School was almost 21, and the Columbus was at about 86.

550
02:28:53,391 --> 02:28:57,215
So the Columbus is the school that offers breakfast in the classroom for everyone.

551
02:28:57,255 --> 02:29:00,819
So you can see the difference that that really makes in the participation rates.

552
02:29:01,600 --> 02:29:05,243
And this is not something that is unique to our district.

553
02:29:05,704 --> 02:29:13,592
The EOS Foundation, which is a nonprofit organization that really promotes school breakfast being offered after the bell, they have seen this

554
02:29:14,196 --> 02:29:24,581
statewide that schools offering free breakfasts in a traditional setting before the bell experience participation rates far lower than those who offer it in the classroom.

555
02:29:25,842 --> 02:29:30,244
Could you explain why the Columbus offers it after the bell versus the others before?

556
02:29:31,424 --> 02:29:32,345
So that's a good question.

557
02:29:32,425 --> 02:29:38,848
The McGlynn Middle School, this is its first year instituting the universal, so I don't know what the decision was

558
02:29:39,306 --> 02:29:41,047
They're the elementary school.

559
02:29:41,567 --> 02:29:46,629
From what I'm told a few years ago, I think this was before I started working here, there was a rodent issue.

560
02:29:46,769 --> 02:29:54,693
They originally started off doing a breakfast in the class model, and there was a rodent issue that was attributed to the breakfast program, so they stopped.

561
02:29:55,053 --> 02:29:59,595
So Mr. Superintendent, are the principals deciding whether it's before or after the bell?

562
02:29:59,795 --> 02:30:00,195
Pretty much.

563
02:30:00,495 --> 02:30:00,895
Pretty much?

564
02:30:01,156 --> 02:30:01,316
Yeah.

565
02:30:02,296 --> 02:30:03,997
Can we ask them to all reevaluate?

566
02:30:04,277 --> 02:30:04,477
Sure.

567
02:30:06,817 --> 02:30:08,198
Would that be a recommendation you'd make?

568
02:30:08,379 --> 02:30:14,966
Yeah, that was my, I just wanted to have you, you know, consider this information and questions of universal breakfast going forward.

569
02:30:15,006 --> 02:30:17,008
There's probably another factor too in terms of busing.

570
02:30:17,248 --> 02:30:25,197
You know, the more busing that takes place, the less likely they are to arrive, you know, and take it before the actual school starts.

571
02:30:25,817 --> 02:30:26,799
Oh, right, yes, yeah.

572
02:30:26,939 --> 02:30:28,861
That has a big impact in participation as well, yeah.

573
02:30:29,209 --> 02:30:29,969
Mr Benedetto?

574
02:30:30,270 --> 02:30:31,170
Thank you.

575
02:30:31,350 --> 02:30:35,673
Could you tell me what the percentage of the forms returned are for each building?

576
02:30:35,693 --> 02:30:36,293
Do you know that?

577
02:30:36,373 --> 02:30:38,074
So the free and reduced eligibility?

578
02:30:38,094 --> 02:30:45,599
Yeah, whether they sign that they need it or they return the form saying that they're not eligible but they have to sign their form.

579
02:30:45,619 --> 02:30:49,141
Does every student sign have a form returned?

580
02:30:49,922 --> 02:30:50,162
No.

581
02:30:50,622 --> 02:30:54,505
And how do we get like two parents that

582
02:30:56,416 --> 02:31:14,301
don't know what this is and it's coming home and they're not knowing to turn them back in and get the quote we need because that would change a lot and do parents know that this also reflects in whether or not they pay for SAT exams as well as college applications.

583
02:31:14,661 --> 02:31:19,803
Their free and reduced lunch has bigger implications other than just foods on a daily basis.

584
02:31:20,243 --> 02:31:35,978
And I don't think, like up at the high school, you might not get any forms, but if they knew that that was tied in and there was like a campaign to really educate people throughout the community, I think that our numbers could actually be higher than what they're listed here.

585
02:31:36,318 --> 02:31:36,538
Right.

586
02:31:37,279 --> 02:31:47,703
So that that's concerning to me and I think we have to have like almost 100% return rate for building and like really make it like a campaign or part of re-registration at each year.

587
02:31:48,504 --> 02:31:55,046
So that way we we are making sure we capture hungry families as well as giving all those alternative

588
02:31:56,687 --> 02:31:57,408
processes.

589
02:31:57,588 --> 02:32:10,541
So I would really like to know how many forms were returned per school, like broken down by school, as well as a plan for outreach for next year, so that way we are reaching every family.

590
02:32:10,601 --> 02:32:13,925
They either sign off yes or they sign off no.

591
02:32:14,185 --> 02:32:19,551
I know it's a big job and a big undertaking, but I think it's well worth it in the community because I don't think people

592
02:32:20,503 --> 02:32:30,499
especially non-English families knowing that there are other things that this qualifies them for and it's so important to make sure that they get food.

593
02:32:32,304 --> 02:32:40,326
Yes, I'd like to comment on that, that we have engaged and made sure that we have the free and reduced applications in multiple languages.

594
02:32:40,506 --> 02:32:41,466
They are returned.

595
02:32:41,966 --> 02:32:44,707
There is not a requirement for them to be returned.

596
02:32:44,767 --> 02:32:46,487
That's not a forced item.

597
02:32:46,547 --> 02:32:53,969
However, we are capturing more free and reduced qualifications because they are incorporated within the portal.

598
02:32:54,269 --> 02:32:56,069
So we automatically draw those down.

599
02:32:56,431 --> 02:33:00,474
So it's not necessary that we receive an actual form back from every household.

600
02:33:00,815 --> 02:33:06,440
We are gathering those and getting those counts regardless through the portals that have.

601
02:33:06,960 --> 02:33:12,725
That's why we've encouraged additional services and we've had outreach with our parent information center.

602
02:33:13,105 --> 02:33:24,595
So we are providing much more detailed information and encouraging families to participate in these other systems that will provide them additional resources and then also

603
02:33:25,330 --> 02:33:27,971
automatically qualify them for free or reduced.

604
02:33:29,252 --> 02:33:34,514
And my point, too, is sometimes there's awards for 100% return rate for classes.

605
02:33:34,854 --> 02:33:43,597
They get really getting the word out and being a campaign so that the word goes home and people are excited and learning about it because they don't pay attention to every form.

606
02:33:44,057 --> 02:33:46,058
And it's so important to feed our children.

607
02:33:46,318 --> 02:33:52,420
And it's so important for kids that say, oh, we don't have money for our college applications.

608
02:33:52,480 --> 02:33:53,241
I'm not applying.

609
02:33:54,537 --> 02:34:08,559
you know, the tests are covered and the applications are cheaper and like it's so many, many more aspects of this, as well as our district could receive more federal funding because of our percentage rates.

610
02:34:10,051 --> 02:34:11,251
That's just a suggestion.

611
02:34:11,331 --> 02:34:13,892
I think I made it maybe last year as well.

612
02:34:14,312 --> 02:34:16,213
So let me just make one clarification.

613
02:34:16,253 --> 02:34:17,573
This is the breakfast program.

614
02:34:17,853 --> 02:34:21,254
This is not the total numbers of students on free and reduced.

615
02:34:22,274 --> 02:34:27,116
You know, not everybody comes in early enough for breakfast, especially at the high school and places like that.

616
02:34:27,196 --> 02:34:34,718
So we'll give you a report with the total numbers because they're much higher when you look at the school lunch program as opposed to the

617
02:34:35,478 --> 02:34:40,361
breakfast program, which is a more, let's say, niche program that not everybody participates in.

618
02:34:41,082 --> 02:34:45,985
It's one that, you know, we'd like to increase, but then we've talked to Andrea Silbert over at EOS, you know, many times.

619
02:34:47,706 --> 02:34:52,389
But I think that the breakfast program doesn't give you a full, accurate picture.

620
02:34:52,429 --> 02:34:59,173
If just at the high school alone, the number of youngsters who are in free and reduced who don't pay a user fee for athletics would tell you that it's much higher than this.

621
02:34:59,693 --> 02:34:59,973
Okay?

622
02:35:00,213 --> 02:35:02,054
So we'll give you that report.

623
02:35:04,438 --> 02:35:07,131
Motion to have that report presented to the school committee.

624
02:35:07,449 --> 02:35:07,709
I'm sorry.

625
02:35:07,729 --> 02:35:07,869
Second.

626
02:35:08,249 --> 02:35:10,691
Thank you, Miss Vanderpool.

627
02:35:11,131 --> 02:35:15,474
I noticed that the Tufts alternative school has a very low participation.

628
02:35:15,774 --> 02:35:22,778
And this really surprised me because I would think it would almost be the natural environment where kids would be coming in and might pick up some breakfast at school.

629
02:35:22,798 --> 02:35:24,439
Do you have any insight into that number?

630
02:35:24,599 --> 02:35:26,700
Yeah, I was really surprised by that also.

631
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:32,944
So we contacted Mr to me over there, and he said that because they're allowed to come in so much

632
02:35:36,966 --> 02:35:40,789
And they can ask for breakfast, but they don't.

633
02:35:41,310 --> 02:35:49,257
But I do think that that's definitely an area of opportunity, especially if you could offer a breakfast that might be an incentive for students to come in.

634
02:35:49,277 --> 02:35:57,864
And the other thing I noticed is most of the schools we see an increase between September and October.

635
02:35:58,305 --> 02:36:00,827
There was only one school where there was a slight decline.

636
02:36:01,420 --> 02:36:11,675
Um, and I'm just want to make sure that we keep on looking at these numbers because I wouldn't want there to be any stigma attached to, um, kids going in for breakfast.

637
02:36:11,935 --> 02:36:14,099
That's why I think the classroom is right.

638
02:36:14,159 --> 02:36:15,340
Environment really is ideal.

639
02:36:17,108 --> 02:36:30,295
And, you know, sort of if it works at the Columbus, you know, maybe if we could talk to some of the principals and ask another one to try it for a month and see how it goes, just to see what kind of participation we have then.

640
02:36:30,515 --> 02:36:30,756
Right.

641
02:36:31,316 --> 02:36:42,462
I know for the past two years in a row, the Eos Foundation has awarded the Columbus a Healthy Start award, and they give those to schools that see breakfast participation rates.

642
02:36:42,955 --> 02:36:47,619
at 80% and higher for so many consecutive months over the course of a year.

643
02:36:47,659 --> 02:36:50,701
So I mean, their average is over 80% year long.

644
02:36:50,721 --> 02:36:53,323
That's great.

645
02:36:53,943 --> 02:36:54,043
OK.

646
02:36:54,824 --> 02:37:03,110
So on the motion by Mr. Benedetto, and also I ask that the superintendent reach out to the various principals to determine if they could do after the bell breakfast.

647
02:37:03,851 --> 02:37:05,172
On that motion, all those in favor?

648
02:37:05,192 --> 02:37:05,872
Aye.

649
02:37:05,932 --> 02:37:06,673
All those opposed?

650
02:37:06,933 --> 02:37:07,653
Motion passes.

651
02:37:08,054 --> 02:37:08,874
Thank you very much, Ms.

652
02:37:08,954 --> 02:37:09,174
Smith.

653
02:37:10,335 --> 02:37:17,722
I'd like to make a motion to suspend the order of business so that we can take up the report on student survey on substance abuse.

654
02:37:17,782 --> 02:37:19,904
There's a motion for suspension of the rules.

655
02:37:20,025 --> 02:37:20,385
Second.

656
02:37:20,785 --> 02:37:21,606
Seconded by Ms.

657
02:37:21,646 --> 02:37:22,046
Cuno.

658
02:37:22,066 --> 02:37:22,907
All those in favor?

659
02:37:22,927 --> 02:37:23,388
Aye.

660
02:37:23,828 --> 02:37:24,529
All those opposed?

661
02:37:24,589 --> 02:37:25,450
Motion passes.

662
02:37:25,670 --> 02:37:29,914
Mayor Burke, we'll report on student survey before our nutritionist leaves.

663
02:37:30,994 --> 02:37:40,660
I saw on some social media that the Columbus School was talking about maybe sour milk at some of the things and asked that they just look into that.

664
02:37:41,260 --> 02:37:50,765
I saw on some social media at the McGlen and definitely at the Columbus, I saw some posts about children not taking the milk because they felt the milk was sour.

665
02:37:51,266 --> 02:37:58,870
Yes, yes, we are aware of that and I guess what I can say in response to that is we handle the milks appropriately.

666
02:37:59,290 --> 02:38:01,451
We use a first in first out rotation system.

667
02:38:01,491 --> 02:38:08,212
So the the oldest milks, you know, are the first ones that are in the coolers and leaving the cooler up.

668
02:38:09,212 --> 02:38:09,853
Make them colder.

669
02:38:10,093 --> 02:38:13,794
I mean, all of all of the the refrigerators are keeping at temp.

670
02:38:13,814 --> 02:38:17,715
So I think this might potentially be a supplier issue.

671
02:38:18,715 --> 02:38:20,995
So we'll have to be monitoring.

672
02:38:21,455 --> 02:38:21,696
Yeah.

673
02:38:22,216 --> 02:38:27,497
But what I can say is from our handling of everything, we're doing everything that we

674
02:38:28,208 --> 02:38:34,695
can to ensure that the milks are at a safe temperature and they are within the best by date.

675
02:38:34,735 --> 02:38:36,257
So they should be good.

676
02:38:36,277 --> 02:38:42,223
But we have to figure out why they're not.

677
02:38:42,243 --> 02:38:45,106
School committee elect, would you like to step up to the mic, please?

678
02:38:51,677 --> 02:39:01,563
I had a question about whether the in-class breakfast, how is the milk transported to the classes and how long does it sit in the classes and come back and over and over multiple times a day?

679
02:39:01,583 --> 02:39:06,886
How do you track that the milk isn't the same milk going to the class for four or five days in a row?

680
02:39:07,507 --> 02:39:11,129
And is it actually kept cold while it's sitting in the class for an hour or two?

681
02:39:11,569 --> 02:39:12,350
Yeah.

682
02:39:12,410 --> 02:39:14,871
So this is for the breakfast in the classroom?

683
02:39:14,971 --> 02:39:15,592
Yeah.

684
02:39:15,612 --> 02:39:19,294
So the breakfast items are transported in coolers.

685
02:39:20,054 --> 02:39:33,127
and they are, they leave that morning and go, and I don't know what the exact time frame is, but they're kept in coolers, and so they are used, probably I would say within an hour, and any of the milks that come back are discarded.

686
02:39:34,689 --> 02:39:37,451
So that should not be contributing to the issue.

687
02:39:39,453 --> 02:39:39,794
Thank you.

688
02:39:41,838 --> 02:39:47,561
Okay, item four, based on suspension of the rules, report on student survey on substance abuse.

689
02:39:48,241 --> 02:39:49,102
We have with us Ms.

690
02:39:49,182 --> 02:39:55,105
Penny Funny Ali from Medford City Hall Team Medford to do a presentation.

691
02:39:55,125 --> 02:39:57,606
Do you need us to move at all?

692
02:39:57,666 --> 02:39:57,946
Maybe.

693
02:39:58,346 --> 02:40:01,027
Let me just turn on this projector and we shall see.

694
02:40:11,356 --> 02:40:12,560
It's going on.

695
02:40:12,761 --> 02:40:14,166
It's going on.

696
02:40:14,527 --> 02:40:14,989
It's kicking in.

697
02:40:27,236 --> 02:40:29,457
Okay, so thank you for having me today.

698
02:40:29,577 --> 02:40:43,942
I'm here to present the data, but I do not do my work alone, and Tony Bento and Rachel Perry are here to talk about the work that they do in the schools that really support youth substance use and prevention of youth substance use in the city.

699
02:40:46,704 --> 02:40:49,747
I just want to say this is a report on a survey called the Community Care Survey.

700
02:40:49,767 --> 02:40:51,989
We've been doing this survey since 2005.

701
02:40:53,050 --> 02:41:01,697
It's done every two years, so we have a long amount of years to see trends that have changed throughout the time of the city.

702
02:41:03,639 --> 02:41:11,264
Some of the things to note are that what it looks at is it looks at risk and protective factors as well as frequency of reported use.

703
02:41:11,284 --> 02:41:20,771
So this is, the youth take this survey, it's an anonymous survey, it comes back to us, we send it to, excuse me, it goes from the school directly to the

704
02:41:21,551 --> 02:41:23,272
The researcher who cleans the data.

705
02:41:24,333 --> 02:41:33,320
By cleaning the data, what I mean is that they eliminate any surveys that exaggerate drug use or any other antisocial behavior.

706
02:41:33,961 --> 02:41:44,889
They eliminate surveys where students report a fictitious drug that's on there, and then anything that's logically inconsistent patterns of drug use, they will eliminate those surveys.

707
02:41:45,229 --> 02:41:50,233
So let's say they had 100 that were not, you know, valid, they will eliminate those.

708
02:41:50,413 --> 02:41:53,214
That will not be included in the total count for the survey itself.

709
02:41:55,335 --> 02:42:09,140
But what it's doing is it's looking atâwe don't ask questions about sexuality, but what risk and protective factors do is that really show what drives young people to do things that are risky.

710
02:42:10,200 --> 02:42:13,483
So that's why we're looking at this larger picture snapshot.

711
02:42:13,843 --> 02:42:19,187
A lot of communities use a youth risk behavior survey and it really looks at the frequency.

712
02:42:19,487 --> 02:42:22,309
It doesn't look at some of the community conditions.

713
02:42:22,710 --> 02:42:25,292
So it's a large report.

714
02:42:25,372 --> 02:42:27,153
We've broken it up for you.

715
02:42:27,473 --> 02:42:29,515
Tonight we're going to talk just about substance abuse.

716
02:42:30,536 --> 02:42:40,292
rates, and then I will come back, if I'm correct, Superintendent Belson, we discussed that I would come back, talk about risk and protective factors, and then come back again and talk about more data that we saw in the survey.

717
02:42:43,109 --> 02:42:51,254
What I'm doing here by showing you this presentation is that I think that we need to remember that this is not a school problem.

718
02:42:51,434 --> 02:42:57,538
This is a societal, family, peer-level, individual-level issue.

719
02:42:58,159 --> 02:43:05,564
And to solve anything that we want to see change on these numbers, we really need to be working as a whole, as a team, to be able to do this.

720
02:43:06,605 --> 02:43:15,292
The school over the years, I've been here since 2008, I began in September of 2008 doing this work, and the schools have had tremendous involvement.

721
02:43:15,552 --> 02:43:20,155
The police department has had tremendous involvement in the work that we've done through the Board of Health.

722
02:43:21,657 --> 02:43:31,104
And we put out many, many, many instances of putting information out to parents, and we have not had public forums where parents come out in droves, and that's not

723
02:43:32,425 --> 02:43:35,766
that we wish they could get the information that we're putting out there.

724
02:43:35,806 --> 02:43:40,067
So one of our urges here tonight is to say to parents, please pay attention.

725
02:43:40,107 --> 02:43:43,608
We are doing prevention education for you.

726
02:43:43,708 --> 02:43:45,448
We have resources for you.

727
02:43:45,848 --> 02:43:50,629
We want to be thinking about substance use prevention long before someone uses substances.

728
02:43:51,089 --> 02:43:58,011
We're fortunate now in the city of Medford at the Board of Health to have an outreach worker, a recovery coach,

729
02:43:58,471 --> 02:44:04,092
who will, you know, between the two of us, we sit and come up with a plan and work with individuals at the police department.

730
02:44:04,432 --> 02:44:19,536
We do an early intervention program where if youth are found drinking or using drugs, we will bring them in for a three-hour education course, give them a screening to see if they themselves have any issues, and then we will speak directly to their families about getting them help.

731
02:44:19,876 --> 02:44:26,938
Because we're really pushing that, you know, this is about getting help and getting this solved before it becomes a chronic issue for you and your family.

732
02:44:27,618 --> 02:44:31,264
So, we have these resources available.

733
02:44:31,604 --> 02:44:37,132
We are begging you to come out to our presentations and or access this information online.

734
02:44:38,274 --> 02:44:42,320
Many programs for parents are going to be going up on the Mystic Valley Public Health

735
02:44:43,601 --> 02:44:45,102
website coming up soon.

736
02:44:45,122 --> 02:44:50,528
That will be linked to the City of Medford's website and hopefully to the school's website and to the police's website.

737
02:44:51,228 --> 02:45:00,277
But today, if you have an issue, and this is a televised so I'm talking to the public, please go to drugfree.org and look for information there.

738
02:45:00,317 --> 02:45:02,419
They can steer you in the right direction.

739
02:45:02,999 --> 02:45:08,583
So, the survey itself, we're looking at three different measures of use rates.

740
02:45:08,683 --> 02:45:10,844
We have lifetime use, so have you ever tried a substance?

741
02:45:11,305 --> 02:45:25,034
Experimentation is something that happens, but use where it becomes a problem or can lead to a problem, we're looking at that at the 30-day prevalence use rate, so whether or not a student has used a substance within the last month, the last 30 days.

742
02:45:25,394 --> 02:45:27,075
That's what we measure as current use.

743
02:45:28,662 --> 02:45:34,886
And historically, we've always done this survey prior to the February vacation.

744
02:45:35,487 --> 02:45:41,170
And this year, I believe in last year as well, the way that the schedule worked out, the survey was done after that time.

745
02:45:41,250 --> 02:45:46,154
So that might be something to think about, but I don't see that reflected in the data at this point.

746
02:45:47,334 --> 02:45:53,258
Binge drinking behavior is reported if five or more drinks in one sitting in the last two weeks.

747
02:45:53,879 --> 02:45:56,661
So that's what we are measuring binge drinking behavior.

748
02:45:57,475 --> 02:46:02,499
So the purpose of prevention is to delay use.

749
02:46:03,279 --> 02:46:06,442
We want to drive those use numbers back.

750
02:46:06,582 --> 02:46:14,308
We want to do our best to get the people who need help, help, and to reduce the amount of people that are trying, experimenting, and using frequently.

751
02:46:14,848 --> 02:46:21,073
So what I have here to show you is I have multiple charts that will show you what's happened over time.

752
02:46:21,453 --> 02:46:23,455
But this one here I think is really important.

753
02:46:23,875 --> 02:46:31,438
So if you look at the youth substance use as a bell curve, you're going to have 5-10% of the students, they're never going to use substances.

754
02:46:31,738 --> 02:46:38,541
They may have family history that causes them, they may have, you know, some school commitments or some religious commitments that prevent them from using.

755
02:46:38,961 --> 02:46:40,302
And on the other end, you might have 5-10%.

756
02:46:41,602 --> 02:46:53,965
percent of students who were going to use no matter what prevention measures were put into place because they have family history, they have trauma, they have other leading factors that could drive them towards something of that nature.

757
02:46:54,225 --> 02:47:05,228
So what our goal is is really to drive the numbers back from, you know, we want as many people getting help and more towards that 5 to 10 percent of use as opposed to never using.

758
02:47:05,268 --> 02:47:07,889
So in 2005, you can see here 71 percent of high school students

759
02:47:11,731 --> 02:47:17,101
71.2 percent of high school students said that they had used alcohol in their lifetime, ninth through twelfth graders.

760
02:47:17,121 --> 02:47:19,104
This is both the high school and the vocational school.

761
02:47:19,585 --> 02:47:22,630
In all of this case, those two schools are combined with the data.

762
02:47:23,849 --> 02:47:30,074
In 2017, 45.8% of the students said that they had used alcohol in their lifetime.

763
02:47:30,934 --> 02:47:34,677
This is a significant change in the rates.

764
02:47:35,197 --> 02:47:39,300
And this is as a result of the teamwork that I talked about when I first started speaking.

765
02:47:39,701 --> 02:47:43,403
So what we're doing is working, and we need to continue doing it.

766
02:47:43,804 --> 02:47:47,526
And we need to continue to bring in more people into the fold and have this conversation.

767
02:47:49,378 --> 02:48:03,805
This is 6th grade, and again, when we report out the data, I have both in your packet, lifetime and 30-day use, but current trends are really where you would see that there's sort of an issue that we would want to be addressing in the community.

768
02:48:04,165 --> 02:48:06,967
That is where we would put more of our weight in the data.

769
02:48:07,387 --> 02:48:14,631
So 6th to 8th grade, as you can see, over time, we've really brought these numbers down.

770
02:48:15,672 --> 02:48:17,854
And you can, and these numbers are extremely low.

771
02:48:17,894 --> 02:48:24,740
What you're looking at is, and all of you should have a chart provided with the actual percentages.

772
02:48:24,760 --> 02:48:28,083
I like to do that because it's hard to read charts sometimes.

773
02:48:28,103 --> 02:48:34,890
It would be on page six, maybe page actually five.

774
02:48:35,390 --> 02:48:37,993
So for middle school students,

775
02:48:39,045 --> 02:48:41,106
You know, 30-day use is 3.4%.

776
02:48:43,387 --> 02:48:46,168
That's a lot lower than the national average.

777
02:48:46,228 --> 02:48:46,728
For U.S.

778
02:48:46,808 --> 02:48:47,949
norm, for 8th grade, it was 7.3%.

779
02:48:47,989 --> 02:48:49,929
And I can tell you that our 8th graders were reporting

780
02:49:03,420 --> 02:49:04,241
our eighth graders reporting 7.9%.

781
02:49:04,281 --> 02:49:07,603
So we do want to be paying attention to that.

782
02:49:07,964 --> 02:49:09,485
It's close to the national average.

783
02:49:10,225 --> 02:49:13,648
It is a low number, thank goodness, but we should be talking about this.

784
02:49:13,688 --> 02:49:16,991
This is why I'm saying we need to talk early and often.

785
02:49:17,351 --> 02:49:22,896
We need to be prepared and we need to be ready to have those conversations.

786
02:49:22,916 --> 02:49:30,622
We all should be talking to our friends' parents so they know what our personal preferences are and plans when they go to their houses, when they go to parties.

787
02:49:31,002 --> 02:49:34,587
They go out to, you know, football games or whatever it is that everyone's well aware.

788
02:49:35,027 --> 02:49:37,250
So we do see the numbers declining.

789
02:49:37,290 --> 02:49:38,912
We always want to be monitoring the numbers.

790
02:49:39,493 --> 02:49:48,645
In the high school, sorry, at the 9th through 12th grade level, we see the decline as well over time, and we're very pleased to see that.

791
02:49:51,517 --> 02:49:55,261
One thing that we're monitoring this year that we've never monitored before is vaping.

792
02:49:55,941 --> 02:50:05,790
So we don't have numbers to compare to the previous years, but what we can tell you is on page four,

793
02:50:12,443 --> 02:50:17,329
What we know right now is that this is what the students reported in February of 2017.

794
02:50:17,489 --> 02:50:24,117
Also remember, all 12th grade data, those students do not go to these school systems any longer.

795
02:50:24,157 --> 02:50:24,858
They have moved on.

796
02:50:25,279 --> 02:50:27,221
So that is something to be thinking about.

797
02:50:29,722 --> 02:50:33,525
We believe that this number is going up exponentially as we speak.

798
02:50:33,966 --> 02:50:40,591
Based on conversations amongst students and staff, there's a lot more concern for vaping.

799
02:50:40,951 --> 02:50:43,293
And we need to be thinking about it overall.

800
02:50:44,014 --> 02:50:45,255
So this is what vaping is.

801
02:50:46,016 --> 02:50:51,440
This is the most popular vaping product that we're hearing about all over the state, really, right?

802
02:50:51,480 --> 02:50:52,241
It's called Juul.

803
02:50:52,901 --> 02:50:54,042
And it looks like a USB.

804
02:50:55,063 --> 02:51:00,131
You can actually charge it by using it as a USB in your computer or wherever.

805
02:51:02,033 --> 02:51:05,078
And one of those is equivalent to one pack of cigarettes.

806
02:51:06,340 --> 02:51:08,643
The most popular product is a mango flavor.

807
02:51:10,410 --> 02:51:15,031
Call me crazy, but I think they're marketing to a very specific population.

808
02:51:15,491 --> 02:51:23,172
They have a very catchy name, and very catchy products, and anything flavored is gonna be really attractive to young people, right?

809
02:51:23,632 --> 02:51:32,414
Now, the thing is about this, the other day we were talking about it, and I said, oh, don't worry, this is a patented product, you really, you know, they're not gonna be making marijuana products with this, right?

810
02:51:32,474 --> 02:51:33,034
That's not true.

811
02:51:33,374 --> 02:51:37,675
You can actually inject marijuana oil into this product once the,

812
02:51:38,115 --> 02:51:38,636
stuff is out.

813
02:51:38,676 --> 02:51:44,901
So you can get any, go on YouTube and you can learn anything you want to learn about how to hack this.

814
02:51:45,342 --> 02:51:52,388
So it's discreet, so you could, somebody could be vaping in here right now and you may not notice.

815
02:51:53,129 --> 02:51:54,870
It can be very discreet in that way.

816
02:51:55,671 --> 02:51:58,914
So it's something that we really need to be paying attention to.

817
02:51:59,074 --> 02:51:59,935
It's very covert.

818
02:52:00,735 --> 02:52:01,596
Did you have something you want to say?

819
02:52:02,274 --> 02:52:14,631
I heard that students are doing it in classrooms because it looks like just a USB and they also like can even exhale right into the hoodies and you don't even see anything.

820
02:52:14,691 --> 02:52:17,875
So kids in class are actually, they call it drooling.

821
02:52:23,484 --> 02:52:31,010
So the reality is that there's a lot of information and misinformation out there about vaping.

822
02:52:31,690 --> 02:52:36,754
The main thing that you need to take away from this is that it contains nicotine and nicotine is one of the most

823
02:52:37,214 --> 02:52:40,035
highly addicted drugs in the entire world, right?

824
02:52:40,416 --> 02:52:47,459
So, um, you know, there may be speculation that, you know, they're vape, you know, that they're gonna get hooked on vaping and then they're gonna get hooked on cigarettes.

825
02:52:47,899 --> 02:52:52,701
I argue that they're probably gonna be hooked on vaping for a very long time is really what the issue's gonna be.

826
02:52:53,282 --> 02:52:58,064
Um, and we don't know, because there isn't long-term data to show what the effect of this will be.

827
02:52:58,424 --> 02:53:03,306
Just like with cigarettes, we didn't know what cigarettes were gonna do to us, and now look at what we're, where we're at.

828
02:53:03,827 --> 02:53:03,987
So,

829
02:53:05,087 --> 02:53:06,668
We need to be cautious about that.

830
02:53:07,008 --> 02:53:12,531
Now I want to show you this because this is a product that is also a vaping product.

831
02:53:12,911 --> 02:53:16,513
They sell these inserts at dispensaries.

832
02:53:16,733 --> 02:53:27,158
So if you see something like this, looks like an old timey cigarette holder, that can also be filled with a THC oil of some kind or something, some sort of marijuana derivative product.

833
02:53:28,470 --> 02:53:37,354
So marijuana has become legalized in Massachusetts, and it's still dangerous for kids to use marijuana.

834
02:53:37,774 --> 02:53:44,917
It can create long-term changes in the way that their brain responds to addictions.

835
02:53:45,097 --> 02:53:47,178
It can do a number of different things.

836
02:53:47,839 --> 02:53:53,381
What I want to show you in this slide is a very, very busy slide, but I put everything in one slide so that I didn't forget about a single thing.

837
02:53:55,162 --> 02:54:03,088
Perception of harm, so great risk of harm, this is how our students said on the survey, that if you tried marijuana, you would be at great risk of harm.

838
02:54:03,349 --> 02:54:08,533
There were other things, moderate risk, no risk, but this is specifically looking at the term great risk of harm.

839
02:54:08,973 --> 02:54:14,297
So the good news is, is that there are a number of people who do think that you'd be at great risk of harm if you tried marijuana just once.

840
02:54:15,739 --> 02:54:23,084
But then in some cases, you know, oddly, that smoking it regularly is somehow okay.

841
02:54:25,865 --> 02:54:31,672
Great risk harm is a measure that if you look at, this is what, this is what the data shows nationally, right?

842
02:54:32,052 --> 02:54:35,136
That if you believe it's harmful, you will use it less.

843
02:54:36,197 --> 02:54:43,145
So what we want to do is make sure that people are well informed of this, of what these drugs and alcohol and everything can do to you.

844
02:54:44,987 --> 02:54:46,528
But I feel like these numbers are pretty low.

845
02:54:47,068 --> 02:54:51,130
I think that this is going to be an ongoing problem for a long time, and I'm going to tell you why.

846
02:54:51,450 --> 02:54:56,933
Because it's very difficult to convey honest facts to young people about marijuana.

847
02:54:57,833 --> 02:55:04,636
And we as a community really need to hunker down and think about how to present this information.

848
02:55:04,736 --> 02:55:06,297
If we provide false facts

849
02:55:07,017 --> 02:55:10,858
of scare tactics to young people, it will not change that number.

850
02:55:11,218 --> 02:55:21,342
It'll probably make other things worse because then they'll know for a fact that you were lying to them about marijuana, maybe you're lying about cocaine, maybe you're lying about heroin or other opioids, right?

851
02:55:21,402 --> 02:55:26,964
So what we want to do is figure out what is our game plan and to really work on that.

852
02:55:26,984 --> 02:55:33,526
I know that there is some education in the curriculum, but I think that we can be doing more and we need to be thinking about this

853
02:55:34,935 --> 02:55:42,161
a little bit more, I think that we as a state should have been thinking about this a little bit more all along the way and be prepared because this was going to happen.

854
02:55:42,761 --> 02:55:57,513
So the other thing to be very aware of, which is startling to me even, even though I've seen it all, no I haven't really seen it all, but is that driving with someone under the influence of marijuana is pretty high in high school students.

855
02:55:59,269 --> 02:56:08,177
So we know one thing for sure that Mothers Against Drunk Driving did a hell of a job of changing drinking and driving rates amongst young people.

856
02:56:08,617 --> 02:56:11,660
But we also need to be thinking about this with marijuana as well.

857
02:56:12,120 --> 02:56:18,646
It looks to me like almost 30 percent of high school seniors last year had driven in a car with someone under the influence of marijuana.

858
02:56:19,727 --> 02:56:24,271
You know, and I think that classically people who smoke marijuana will go for a joy ride, right?

859
02:56:24,311 --> 02:56:25,032
They hop in their car.

860
02:56:25,052 --> 02:56:26,353
It's sort of a part of the culture.

861
02:56:26,926 --> 02:56:35,393
is, you know, getting in your car and getting isolated, getting away from, you know, wherever, especially when you're a teenager because you don't have the freedom to smoke weed in your house or marijuana in your house.

862
02:56:35,433 --> 02:56:38,075
So, um, we need to be paying attention to that.

863
02:56:38,316 --> 02:56:40,497
We need to be paying very close attention to that, I think.

864
02:56:42,199 --> 02:56:44,361
All in all, if you were to, um,

865
02:56:46,192 --> 02:56:52,737
take a look at these marijuana rates, we are low in use rates.

866
02:56:52,797 --> 02:56:55,379
We're lower than most of the country.

867
02:56:55,459 --> 02:57:01,583
So I think that, you know, it's really interesting.

868
02:57:02,204 --> 02:57:04,025
Let me just go back real quick.

869
02:57:04,225 --> 02:57:05,106
Especially with high school.

870
02:57:06,041 --> 02:57:10,223
So marijuana is, um, the gray line.

871
02:57:10,643 --> 02:57:15,565
The third line down here starting on the left and then it goes up.

872
02:57:15,585 --> 02:57:21,827
2009-2013, which makes perfect sense because it's decriminalization, medical marijuana becomes legal, right?

873
02:57:21,847 --> 02:57:29,070
So the perception of harm has definitely changed at that point, but at what, for some reason from 2013 into 2017 we're still seeing a decline

874
02:57:31,551 --> 02:57:33,752
in that use, in that regular use of marijuana.

875
02:57:34,192 --> 02:57:43,614
But what typically happens with marijuana use rates is there may be less people who start using marijuana, but the people who use marijuana use it far more chronically.

876
02:57:44,355 --> 02:57:45,655
So they may use it more.

877
02:57:45,775 --> 02:57:47,876
So that's something to also be thinking about.

878
02:57:52,591 --> 02:58:00,096
And then finally, we get to the end of the presentation here, where we're doing a lot of things as a community.

879
02:58:00,236 --> 02:58:02,478
I mentioned the youth diversion program.

880
02:58:03,339 --> 02:58:10,944
I mentioned all the work that we've done over the years working with the school and the police, working on research, finding evidence-based practices.

881
02:58:11,544 --> 02:58:12,925
That's what the city has done.

882
02:58:13,906 --> 02:58:16,708
But we also have a grant called Partnerships for Success.

883
02:58:17,148 --> 02:58:20,311
That's specifically focusing on prescription drug prevention.

884
02:58:21,291 --> 02:58:22,712
Our numbers are very low.

885
02:58:23,152 --> 02:58:48,681
If you go back to your charts, and you look at 30-day use rates, and even, well, I would say look at your lifetime rates of prescription drugs, you'll see that in 2005, for high school students, we had 11.4% of students reporting that they used prescription drugs without a doctor's prescription.

886
02:58:49,574 --> 02:58:53,516
And you're looking at now, of all students ever having tried, 3.8%.

887
02:58:55,317 --> 02:59:03,840
So regardless of the situation that's happening in our community with overdoses, we're seeing youth rates decline with opioid use.

888
02:59:05,201 --> 02:59:13,445
I still see, you know, numbers declining with tranquilizers and then also stimulants are sort of leveled off from the previous year.

889
02:59:14,325 --> 02:59:20,552
Um, our urge with our grant is to really say we need to be paying attention to all of these prescription drugs.

890
02:59:20,973 --> 02:59:25,939
They all, um, cause, you know, can create an effect and cause a problem.

891
02:59:26,399 --> 02:59:28,742
Um, opioids are clearly our biggest concern.

892
02:59:28,782 --> 02:59:29,903
It's all over the news.

893
02:59:30,404 --> 02:59:33,708
And that's a good thing because people are talking about it to their kids.

894
02:59:33,788 --> 02:59:34,809
They're talking about,

895
02:59:35,149 --> 02:59:47,795
what's going on with other family members maybe, um, my aunt lives in Indiana, she had crazy surgery and they were all over her prescription pain meds, so I was very pleased to hear that, not just in Massachusetts but other parts of the country.

896
02:59:48,195 --> 02:59:50,456
Doctors are paying attention to those pain medications.

897
02:59:50,957 --> 02:59:55,379
Um, but one thing is I went to Tufts last week and I did a training on, um,

898
02:59:56,099 --> 03:00:02,942
how to use naloxone with Armstrong Ambulance, and I stated that cocaine is being cut with fentanyl on the street.

899
03:00:03,062 --> 03:00:04,742
And I had a kid look up at me like, oh.

900
03:00:05,423 --> 03:00:07,944
So I have, and I'm not saying that kid uses cocaine.

901
03:00:07,984 --> 03:00:15,266
My point though being that people are unaware of this, and it's very important to know that we have to pay attention to all drug use.

902
03:00:15,406 --> 03:00:18,828
It should not be about this drug is bad, this one isn't as bad.

903
03:00:19,368 --> 03:00:22,049
All drugs are bad because, and alcohol too,

904
03:00:22,649 --> 03:00:27,292
because it creates addiction and pathways to addiction then lead to further addiction problems.

905
03:00:28,052 --> 03:00:30,433
So this is something that we just want to be aware of.

906
03:00:31,214 --> 03:00:36,356
So anyhow, the Partnerships for Success grant, we have multiple projects that we're working with the school on.

907
03:00:36,876 --> 03:00:47,222
One thing is a health and safety guide went out to all families from, I believe, 8th grade to 11th grade at the end of last year.

908
03:00:47,702 --> 03:00:58,925
And it was a 24-page guide, multiple, multiple things to think about, where to dispose of drugs, what is vaping, you know, understanding stress in your students, prescription drugs.

909
03:00:59,045 --> 03:01:04,706
It was a very well-organized litany of resources as well as information.

910
03:01:05,286 --> 03:01:08,987
That's one way that we're trying to get information out to parents is direct mailing.

911
03:01:09,908 --> 03:01:15,369
Another thing that we're doing that I think is really important is that we've helped through working with Rachel

912
03:01:15,749 --> 03:01:22,514
We've implemented a module on prescription drugs into the 10th grade curriculum for the Michigan model.

913
03:01:23,354 --> 03:01:29,439
And then we have a risk to resiliency professional development series where we're talking about trauma-informed care.

914
03:01:29,839 --> 03:01:32,061
We're talking about absenteeism.

915
03:01:32,601 --> 03:01:37,945
And really what we're trying to communicate is that we want to build these kids up.

916
03:01:38,485 --> 03:01:44,309
If we just say that you're going to do drugs, you're going to do drugs, they might do drugs if you've told them that's who they are.

917
03:01:44,770 --> 03:01:53,956
We're trying to really do the opposite of that and try to identify those sparks, those things that make individuals who they are and things that they can find sense of purpose.

918
03:01:54,056 --> 03:01:59,100
Not our sense of purpose on these kids, but what is their sense of purpose so that they can have that.

919
03:01:59,480 --> 03:02:05,622
driven internal, you know, guiding thing that keeps them in that 5 to 10% away from substances.

920
03:02:06,102 --> 03:02:09,123
So we're working with faculty to get them that information.

921
03:02:09,143 --> 03:02:18,466
So through the lens of asset building, the lens of looking at kids as though they have positive things to bring to this world, but understanding those risk factors.

922
03:02:18,486 --> 03:02:23,308
And then finally, we're working with two identified faculty members.

923
03:02:23,428 --> 03:02:27,009
One's a coach and one's also one's a academic.

924
03:02:27,409 --> 03:02:28,729
after school club advisor.

925
03:02:29,110 --> 03:02:33,091
And we're working with them to do training to all of the school clubs and advisors.

926
03:02:33,111 --> 03:02:36,552
Because in the city of Medford, that's where kids go after school in the high school.

927
03:02:36,592 --> 03:02:37,392
They go to the clubs.

928
03:02:37,412 --> 03:02:38,233
They go to sports.

929
03:02:38,573 --> 03:02:42,974
So we're doing a integrated training with them around developmental relationships.

930
03:02:43,314 --> 03:02:46,316
Just what I was saying, how do you identify those sparks in that kid?

931
03:02:46,616 --> 03:02:49,377
You have these high, high achievers who are overstressed out.

932
03:02:49,677 --> 03:02:53,278
And you have people who don't participate because the high, high achievers might be taken over.

933
03:02:53,558 --> 03:02:56,339
So we're trying to talk about how do you balance that, how you facilitate your clubs.

934
03:02:56,679 --> 03:03:00,161
How do you operate as a club advisor as opposed to a teacher in a classroom?

935
03:03:00,522 --> 03:03:03,323
So those are our main programs that we're doing at the city.

936
03:03:03,343 --> 03:03:08,647
And then I'm going to step back and let Rachel and Tony talk about the projects that they've done in the school.

937
03:03:09,867 --> 03:03:11,408
And then I'll answer questions.

938
03:03:12,029 --> 03:03:12,489
Thank you, Penny.

939
03:03:12,509 --> 03:03:13,009
Thank you.

940
03:03:14,730 --> 03:03:15,151
Good evening.

941
03:03:15,871 --> 03:03:18,012
I wanted to talk a little bit about vaping.

942
03:03:18,533 --> 03:03:23,976
Penny had talked about our numbers going down, but we have noticed we're seeing more and more of it here at the high school.

943
03:03:24,400 --> 03:03:25,260
So we have addressed it.

944
03:03:26,441 --> 03:03:43,445
One thing we have done is on November 21st, there was a meeting, a staff meeting that Nick Tucci actually presented information on vaping to our teachers, to our staff, presented what to look for, what the dangers are, and what they can do if they see a student actually vaping in class, what the steps are from there.

945
03:03:44,285 --> 03:03:47,946
Tony has actually done some information out on our blog.

946
03:03:48,345 --> 03:03:49,006
out to parents.

947
03:03:49,466 --> 03:03:51,228
So that was out, I believe, was that October?

948
03:03:51,548 --> 03:03:52,349
That was in October.

949
03:03:53,891 --> 03:03:58,835
What we're working on right now is another message that goes out to all parents that will be going out in December.

950
03:04:00,898 --> 03:04:10,287
Mr. Dempsey and Lisa Dunphy are also working on a video that students will be making and that will actually be presented as a homeroom activity in January.

951
03:04:10,347 --> 03:04:12,309
So that will go out to all the students at the high school.

952
03:04:13,818 --> 03:04:23,772
We have set up a presentation for February 8th for all parents, where it will be a vaping presentation along with In Plain Sight, which will be here again at the high school.

953
03:04:23,792 --> 03:04:29,360
We had that at Seahall last year, but we thought it would be something that in light of everything that we could bring back.

954
03:04:31,156 --> 03:04:38,900
And as part of our Michigan model curriculum, we've added vaping to any lesson that included tobacco.

955
03:04:39,020 --> 03:04:42,662
So this is in the second year at the high school and the first year at the middle schools.

956
03:04:43,342 --> 03:04:51,686
I did reach out to the principals at the middle schools and they really haven't seen much going on with vaping there, but we have seen the uptick here at the high school.

957
03:04:51,846 --> 03:04:53,447
They know what to look for in the middle schools?

958
03:04:53,827 --> 03:04:54,788
The teachers and?

959
03:04:55,028 --> 03:04:57,049
That's something that we can actually present.

960
03:04:57,109 --> 03:04:59,010
That would be the next step to bring it down to the middle school.

961
03:05:00,114 --> 03:05:00,454
Thank you.

962
03:05:01,915 --> 03:05:02,415
Good evening.

963
03:05:02,715 --> 03:05:11,679
I think some of the health services department activities we've talked about in the past, first being the SBIRT screening that we do in grade 9.

964
03:05:11,919 --> 03:05:13,940
This year we're extending that to grade 7.

965
03:05:14,941 --> 03:05:23,865
We're in the process of finishing all the training for the middle school staff so that we can start that after the turn of the year.

966
03:05:24,301 --> 03:05:26,742
and our high school screening will start in January.

967
03:05:27,722 --> 03:05:47,147
The other project the School Health Advisory Council has been involved in is we're reaching out to the community physicians, so we've met with the chief of pediatrics at Winchester Hospital, and we're looking to get onto the agenda for one of their Grand Rounds meetings, and we're going to be discussing ways that

968
03:05:47,979 --> 03:05:52,462
We as school support staff can work and collaborate with the community physicians.

969
03:05:52,502 --> 03:06:01,387
So we have better communication and we're, we each understand each other's models and we can be working on the same agendas.

970
03:06:02,208 --> 03:06:05,409
So we're very pleased to be reaching out into the community for that.

971
03:06:08,711 --> 03:06:11,193
I think everything else has been mentioned.

972
03:06:12,033 --> 03:06:16,516
But our real goal is to get out education to parents and to faculty.

973
03:06:16,986 --> 03:06:18,808
on this year about all these changes.

974
03:06:20,089 --> 03:06:26,196
First of all, I just want to say thank you to all of you and everyone who's involved in this.

975
03:06:26,256 --> 03:06:30,961
The educational piece in this is extremely important and the work that you've done has been extremely important.

976
03:06:31,382 --> 03:06:32,563
So I want to say thank you for that.

977
03:06:32,863 --> 03:06:38,449
But I do have some questions and as far as the survey, Penny, when the survey goes out,

978
03:06:39,730 --> 03:06:44,053
Are there questions on the survey asking, like, when do they do this?

979
03:06:44,133 --> 03:06:44,874
Is it weekends?

980
03:06:44,954 --> 03:06:47,656
Is it, you know, after school, before school, during school?

981
03:06:48,736 --> 03:06:49,857
Why are they doing it?

982
03:06:49,917 --> 03:06:53,540
Are they doing it just as an experimental one-time thing?

983
03:06:53,600 --> 03:06:54,941
Are they doing it because they're bored?

984
03:06:55,001 --> 03:06:56,822
They're doing it because there's peer pressure?

985
03:06:58,423 --> 03:07:00,624
You know, different questions like that.

986
03:07:00,684 --> 03:07:02,025
Is there anything like that in the survey?

987
03:07:02,366 --> 03:07:04,007
No, there's no questions like that.

988
03:07:04,427 --> 03:07:08,690
But there are questions about where they get their alcohol, or their, I believe it's just alcohol.

989
03:07:09,190 --> 03:07:16,196
But I do think it is important, but not that I'm saying that no matter when anyone uses anything like this, it's always important.

990
03:07:16,536 --> 03:07:20,479
But I think if we could at least get a base on, well, gee, it's happening more on the weekends.

991
03:07:20,539 --> 03:07:21,700
It's happening after school.

992
03:07:21,780 --> 03:07:26,123
It's happening, you know, for our students that are busy.

993
03:07:26,584 --> 03:07:29,246
Like, are they doing it more when it's not their season?

994
03:07:29,706 --> 03:07:34,270
You know, are they doing it when it's not their hockey season or their soccer season or their football season?

995
03:07:34,890 --> 03:07:55,036
Or is it, you know, for our drama students, and I'm not picking on clubs, I'm just saying as examples, you know, is it students that are always involved with a particular project that they're in or a team that they're on or a debate after school that kind of makes them think twice because they definitely know the repercussions of that.

996
03:07:56,816 --> 03:08:06,508
For us, Paul, I think it would be very important to know, because if we could stop pinpointing where these, you know, stats go, okay, it's lower at this time, it's higher at this time.

997
03:08:06,628 --> 03:08:09,631
Is it around, you know, is it around final exams?

998
03:08:09,772 --> 03:08:10,993
Is it around MCAS?

999
03:08:11,394 --> 03:08:12,475
Is it around the parks?

1000
03:08:12,755 --> 03:08:16,079
You know, there's so many variables, and I think that

1001
03:08:17,040 --> 03:08:19,944
We you have done this survey now for the last few years.

1002
03:08:20,645 --> 03:08:25,512
I mean, as a school committee member and as a parent, I think I would like to see it a little bit more expand.

1003
03:08:25,552 --> 03:08:33,202
I know it's a lot more work, but to expand it to really see the pinpoint of where these students, you know, and why they're doing it.

1004
03:08:34,484 --> 03:08:37,727
Sometimes there's no answers to those questions, and I totally understand that.

1005
03:08:38,829 --> 03:08:51,262
The other thing I was going to ask you, too, is you had mentioned about, and I apologize if I used the wrong terminology, but like the interventions, if you find that there's like a group of students that are having a party.

1006
03:08:52,563 --> 03:08:55,565
And then you bring them in for a three-hour workshop.

1007
03:08:56,986 --> 03:08:58,767
Have we found those numbers to go up?

1008
03:08:58,987 --> 03:09:01,348
No, those numbers are very low, actually.

1009
03:09:02,169 --> 03:09:10,934
Our police officer, we've been doing this project since 2012, and it's been rolled out for about three years now.

1010
03:09:13,168 --> 03:09:14,108
The numbers are very low.

1011
03:09:15,729 --> 03:09:23,190
We just are not seeing very many kids in the park, not by we, I'm not a patrol officer, but the patrol officer is not seeing people out in the park very often.

1012
03:09:23,630 --> 03:09:33,253
We've sent out youth cars specifically for that on high incident times and they're just not having as many of those calls coming in as they did in the years past.

1013
03:09:36,154 --> 03:09:39,476
So I think that it's very interesting.

1014
03:09:39,536 --> 03:09:42,018
So what I would say to you is this about those questions.

1015
03:09:42,038 --> 03:09:43,399
I just want to answer that.

1016
03:09:43,839 --> 03:09:53,466
This survey is a national survey, and the questions that are on there are vetted through research.

1017
03:09:53,926 --> 03:10:05,658
So to add more questions on, this is already 200 questions for the students to sit and get through, which is far more extensive than the YRBS that others ask.

1018
03:10:05,698 --> 03:10:07,259
So we're already asking a lot from these kids.

1019
03:10:07,619 --> 03:10:12,144
But the other thing is that we can get some of that information just through a different method.

1020
03:10:12,184 --> 03:10:15,307
We could use focus groups, key informant interviews.

1021
03:10:15,974 --> 03:10:21,900
We would just need to find a way to get like a third party to come in, you know, and to do that and to set those up.

1022
03:10:21,960 --> 03:10:24,663
So, for instance, I'm calling out to all the parents.

1023
03:10:24,723 --> 03:10:40,338
If parents know that, you know, they want to know this information, they're willing to sign a permission slip, we have already have the means to start asking questions like this and getting qualitative data for us to find more out about when and where and how this is happening in the city.

1024
03:10:40,683 --> 03:10:42,143
I just think it's really important.

1025
03:10:42,203 --> 03:10:46,365
I mean, I understand the national one because you do want to compare us to everyone else.

1026
03:10:47,085 --> 03:10:51,546
The bottom line is also we want to make sure of what's happening in our own backyard.

1027
03:10:52,007 --> 03:10:59,169
And I think that, you know, again, it's not forcing anyone to, you know, to answer these questions, but I think it's really important to know when

1028
03:10:59,989 --> 03:11:01,131
and certain things are happening.

1029
03:11:01,812 --> 03:11:08,441
And as far as to go back to, you know, kids hanging around the park, kids haven't been hanging around the park in a very long time.

1030
03:11:08,501 --> 03:11:10,283
That doesn't really happen as much anymore.

1031
03:11:10,664 --> 03:11:13,427
Years ago, parents allowed kids to hang around the park.

1032
03:11:13,768 --> 03:11:14,669
Nowadays, they don't.

1033
03:11:15,330 --> 03:11:16,472
But that doesn't mean that

1034
03:11:16,792 --> 03:11:18,735
just because they're not things aren't happening.

1035
03:11:19,395 --> 03:11:33,273
And I don't want to put blinders on and say that everybody's perfect and nothing's happening, but unfortunately we have seen, and I'm not saying it in the city of Medford, and I'm not saying it doesn't happen in the city of Medford, but unfortunately we have seen situations

1036
03:11:33,894 --> 03:11:51,010
from you know it hits the media or whatever that well you know g parents think well my kids are gonna go out and drink anyway so why don't we all have them downstairs in the basement or g you know they're gonna be doing that anyway so why don't we have them you know here so just because they're not in a so-called park

1037
03:11:52,911 --> 03:12:09,538
I still think that we have to have our ears and eyes open, and that's why I was saying, you know, if our administration, if our teachers hear anything about this big party going on or anything like that, you know, hey, you know, if the police officers happen to be around that area at that time,

1038
03:12:09,878 --> 03:12:12,900
And it's not a get you, I have to get you type of thing.

1039
03:12:13,200 --> 03:12:18,242
It's really to be more preventative before anything happens.

1040
03:12:18,282 --> 03:12:18,943
That's all it is.

1041
03:12:19,623 --> 03:12:23,665
And as far as the vaporing and the marijuana, I mean,

1042
03:12:26,346 --> 03:12:40,531
My opinion is because now the legalization of it all, and I think that, you know, students and anyone who had the mentality before saying, oh, gee, it was marijuana that didn't want to touch it, now like, oh, it's marijuana because, like, we can't have it.

1043
03:12:40,911 --> 03:12:41,811
And I've seen it.

1044
03:12:41,971 --> 03:12:43,432
I've seen it this summer especially.

1045
03:12:43,872 --> 03:12:53,374
I've seen it like, you know, people just, you know, smoking it, going down the street, and you have young children with you, and now young children are smelling it, and you're smelling it.

1046
03:12:53,815 --> 03:12:58,176
And here we were years ago saying, you know, well, gee, do you know what, you know, secondhand smoking does?

1047
03:12:58,256 --> 03:13:04,577
Now we have to explain to our kids, you know, well, gee, secondhand marijuana, inhaling it.

1048
03:13:04,677 --> 03:13:07,598
You know, and it's a very, very concerning situation.

1049
03:13:08,278 --> 03:13:15,063
I know that as a school system, we've been lucky enough to say, yes, we can ban it because we ban cigarettes.

1050
03:13:15,103 --> 03:13:16,664
You're not allowed to do that.

1051
03:13:17,145 --> 03:13:26,271
I just don't know if that number now is rising because students, you know, it's a new thing, you know, and I don't know if it's the mentality of it all and we could do it.

1052
03:13:26,311 --> 03:13:27,252
It's not a big deal.

1053
03:13:27,312 --> 03:13:32,075
It's not as bad as the cigarettes because we don't have anything out there yet to prove that.

1054
03:13:32,916 --> 03:13:35,218
So I don't know if those numbers are going up because of it.

1055
03:13:37,593 --> 03:13:53,928
Yeah, I mean, I have a very extensive conversation with one of the classes here a couple months ago about vaping, about marijuana, and, you know, they were really practical.

1056
03:13:54,848 --> 03:13:56,009
They want to know where the research is.

1057
03:13:57,219 --> 03:13:58,960
They want to see the data.

1058
03:13:59,100 --> 03:14:05,863
This is a good thing in many ways, because these are well-educated young people who are researching information on their own.

1059
03:14:06,224 --> 03:14:10,065
On the same hand, you know, so they want to see it.

1060
03:14:10,186 --> 03:14:11,266
And unfortunately, it's not there.

1061
03:14:11,326 --> 03:14:12,026
It's not provided.

1062
03:14:12,107 --> 03:14:15,348
So we're kind of, you know, but we had, I pushed them.

1063
03:14:15,408 --> 03:14:19,270
I pushed them far and hard to think about this in a broader context.

1064
03:14:19,350 --> 03:14:21,511
And we had a really rich discussion.

1065
03:14:22,232 --> 03:14:26,854
And, you know, I think that there's tons of opportunity for us to have youth-led,

1066
03:14:27,575 --> 03:14:30,836
initiatives that talk about vaping, that talk about marijuana use.

1067
03:14:30,876 --> 03:14:33,678
I think that we can definitely be looking at that in the future.

1068
03:14:33,698 --> 03:14:36,179
These are really brilliant kids in the school.

1069
03:14:36,619 --> 03:14:39,900
So I'd be very interested to start doing that.

1070
03:14:39,920 --> 03:14:42,261
Just two more questions real quick.

1071
03:14:42,281 --> 03:14:44,242
One is to both Tony and Rachel.

1072
03:14:44,582 --> 03:14:48,344
You were saying that you're speaking to our teachers more and more now about the vaping

1073
03:14:48,464 --> 03:14:50,886
to be more aware of it, to be more cautious of it.

1074
03:14:50,906 --> 03:14:53,228
And they know what the next steps are.

1075
03:14:53,288 --> 03:14:54,449
But what do the students know?

1076
03:14:54,469 --> 03:14:55,890
What are their next steps?

1077
03:14:55,950 --> 03:14:57,672
If they're caught with it, what happens?

1078
03:14:59,574 --> 03:15:03,617
The administration would follow the discipline codes that are in the handbook.

1079
03:15:03,657 --> 03:15:07,340
So it's similar to using, God bless you, tobacco products.

1080
03:15:07,661 --> 03:15:11,424
So they would follow those discipline codes.

1081
03:15:12,751 --> 03:15:21,175
And I guess, Penny, the other thing is for you is I know that you've done a lot of outreach, but is there still any one-to-one on with the schools?

1082
03:15:21,215 --> 03:15:28,879
Like when they have parent-teacher nights or if they're doing a special thing in their schools, is there anything going on that you have a table set up?

1083
03:15:29,600 --> 03:15:35,363
Because I know it's difficult sometimes to get parents out because everyone is busy, but sometimes if they're there and it's

1084
03:15:36,403 --> 03:15:52,607
I don't want to overtake another meeting, but I'm just saying that if you know that you're going to get a good crowd out there because of that meeting, is there something set up that night with your information, with someone out there to talk or maybe even have a five-minute, you know, discussion with the audience?

1085
03:15:53,427 --> 03:16:00,629
So over the years, there's been, you know, a myriad of ways that I've been included in these types of events.

1086
03:16:01,089 --> 03:16:03,170
I've had opportunities to speak before.

1087
03:16:04,176 --> 03:16:11,283
The parent teacher night presentation begins at that table there.

1088
03:16:12,624 --> 03:16:20,212
The best part about the City of Medford and the work that we've done here is that this community really takes on the work themselves.

1089
03:16:20,733 --> 03:16:25,258
And so when high quality information is being put out, I don't need to be there.

1090
03:16:25,958 --> 03:16:28,599
just to be a steward over it, it's being done.

1091
03:16:29,019 --> 03:16:39,784
So all the stuff that happens for when DA Ryan comes and talks about social host liability, that's a tremendous program and that's happening on a regular yearly basis.

1092
03:16:39,804 --> 03:16:43,446
So those are the kinds of things that we really, really shows how

1093
03:16:44,346 --> 03:16:46,508
much effort is being put in by the school system.

1094
03:16:48,189 --> 03:17:01,178
Last year we had Dr. Ruth Cody come and do a presentation as a partnership and there were 75 people there but the majority were faculty and other people that work in school systems throughout the region.

1095
03:17:01,578 --> 03:17:04,901
So again you know the first time we ever had a presentation here it was

1096
03:17:05,901 --> 03:17:09,983
Be a parent, not a pal, social host liability, just like the DAs.

1097
03:17:10,383 --> 03:17:13,024
There were three people that showed up.

1098
03:17:13,404 --> 03:17:17,526
And there was 2,400 mail outs that went out advertising this program.

1099
03:17:17,806 --> 03:17:28,490
So it's just like, it's nice to see when people do come and we get to talk to them and they see that, you know, we're not, but really what happens is when we do a community table, I want to be completely honest with you.

1100
03:17:29,090 --> 03:17:39,856
This is very scary to people to talk about substance abuse when you're talking about, you know, a 7th grade kid or even a 7 year old or even a high school kid who you've never seen have an issue with it.

1101
03:17:40,977 --> 03:17:42,177
They do not want to talk to it.

1102
03:17:42,217 --> 03:17:46,720
That's why we're called Team Medford, not the Substance Abuse People, because people just don't want to talk about it.

1103
03:17:47,040 --> 03:17:55,806
So it's very rare that you get a good, you know, showing out at your table at the community tabling events, but it is worth it.

1104
03:17:55,826 --> 03:17:59,128
We do often have a really good conversation with at least one person.

1105
03:17:59,548 --> 03:18:03,991
So yes, I mean, we go to as many as we can and we'll continue to do that.

1106
03:18:04,011 --> 03:18:09,394
But I'd like to see where it's actually an institutionalized conversation.

1107
03:18:09,787 --> 03:18:13,813
It's not just like, oh, the substance abuse people are coming and walking in and they're going to tell you some information.

1108
03:18:14,154 --> 03:18:21,485
It's nice when we're coming and we're asked to be experts, but it's really a part of the growth of an individual to be talking about this.

1109
03:18:21,566 --> 03:18:23,889
So I think that it should be sort of embedded in everything.

1110
03:18:25,411 --> 03:18:35,642
I know having you come in just by yourselves, even though you have a great program, it's just as you mentioned, it's scary sometimes, and people don't want to hear it sometimes.

1111
03:18:36,043 --> 03:18:40,628
So this way here, instead of having it directly, that's why I was saying if there was some collaboration.

1112
03:18:40,988 --> 03:18:41,968
And I know that you've had it.

1113
03:18:41,988 --> 03:18:44,449
Yeah, and I know that they've had it.

1114
03:18:44,509 --> 03:19:02,214
I just, for people that are watching that don't know about it, you know, and maybe they don't feel comfortable calling you, but they might feel comfortable calling a principal or a teacher or, you know, or a child listening, you know, happens to listen to this and asks another, you know, another student, at least they know that, gee,

1115
03:19:02,634 --> 03:19:05,175
They don't have to necessarily call you directly.

1116
03:19:05,195 --> 03:19:08,296
They can go to someone because they know that you're all working together.

1117
03:19:08,356 --> 03:19:08,936
Absolutely.

1118
03:19:08,976 --> 03:19:09,877
That's absolutely true.

1119
03:19:10,237 --> 03:19:16,019
And one of the biggest things for their buck in the college setting is how to help a friend.

1120
03:19:16,759 --> 03:19:21,901
And we worked with a student last year to put up posters that were about how to help a friend.

1121
03:19:21,961 --> 03:19:23,462
And so they're advertised to the kids.

1122
03:19:24,782 --> 03:19:30,686
about how do you get resources for your friends, and they're up, but again, do they see them?

1123
03:19:30,746 --> 03:19:37,370
Unless we paid a million dollars to have a Snapchat story commercial, I don't know if anyone's ever going to see it, let's be honest.

1124
03:19:37,470 --> 03:19:38,250
Mr. Benedetto.

1125
03:19:38,290 --> 03:19:43,553
Do we have a vaping policy on the books or are we using the tobacco policy?

1126
03:19:50,658 --> 03:20:00,045
So we're using the tobacco policy because vaping is sort of a derivative and you know but as we move forward we'll obviously specify a little bit more completely.

1127
03:20:00,245 --> 03:20:15,496
Well with the growth I see throughout not just our community but socially and adults as well as high school age students I would like for this committee to start working on that so that way it's in our handbooks as vaping

1128
03:20:16,036 --> 03:20:44,397
as jeweling, as the correct terminology, so students are very clear how we as adults feel in this community about this, because students just do not believe, they think that, oh, I quit smoking, I'm only vaping now, and that's what you hear, and they don't realize when it gets in their lungs, it's like popcorn, and it blows up their lungs, and it does all these health implications, and there's not a lot of data because they haven't been doing it for years, but having,

1129
03:20:45,478 --> 03:20:51,162
Two people in my house who read this report before I got here, almost 27 and almost 25.

1130
03:20:51,242 --> 03:20:58,488
One's a future NP and one works in another community on these exact programs.

1131
03:20:58,968 --> 03:21:00,949
They were happy to see our numbers.

1132
03:21:01,730 --> 03:21:03,751
that we're doing a great job in MedFed.

1133
03:21:04,352 --> 03:21:13,278
We want to be clear, call it what it is, name it, say it's not okay, and tell them that from day one, so that way the wording is correct.

1134
03:21:13,298 --> 03:21:16,700
Because once you name something, it's not like this secret thing anymore.

1135
03:21:17,241 --> 03:21:17,861
It's not as fun.

1136
03:21:19,022 --> 03:21:23,203
So that's a motion on on the floor and I need a second second my colleagues.

1137
03:21:24,143 --> 03:21:30,684
I'd like to see this in place and in every handbook at every at our junior high and high school level by next year.

1138
03:21:31,504 --> 03:21:39,065
So that parents know that this is happening in our community and that we're taking it seriously and we're not going to we're not going to continue.

1139
03:21:39,826 --> 03:21:40,686
Thank you very much.

1140
03:21:40,706 --> 03:21:41,866
Mr. Van de Kloot.

1141
03:21:42,146 --> 03:21:47,747
Honey last spring I was able to attend and I don't remember the title of it but the night of remembrance.

1142
03:21:48,908 --> 03:21:54,350
for those who had died of opiate deaths, related deaths.

1143
03:21:54,950 --> 03:22:00,251
And one of the things, and it was a very powerful presentation, but there were two speakers that particularly impacted me.

1144
03:22:00,631 --> 03:22:04,052
They were both students who had previously attended Medford High.

1145
03:22:05,252 --> 03:22:10,434
And one of the things that they said was, they both said they actually were pretty good kids here.

1146
03:22:12,114 --> 03:22:21,424
you know, were popular, they were, you know, kids who were not involved, particularly with drugs or alcohol at that time.

1147
03:22:22,965 --> 03:22:28,611
And one of my biggest concerns is, I think we're doing good work laying a positive

1148
03:22:29,432 --> 03:22:50,093
foundation here but I'm totally worried about that transition off topology and um I'm not sure I'm you just mentioned some posters how to help a friend and you know we see these uh incredible stories of you know the frat brothers who you know are drinking too much and then let their frat brother die um you know and that's that's where I'm wondering our last

1149
03:22:51,654 --> 03:22:53,375
We're touching the kids at 10th grade.

1150
03:22:54,236 --> 03:23:00,439
I don't know whether we're discussing at that point, hey, when you get to college, these are things to expect, you know.

1151
03:23:01,520 --> 03:23:05,742
I'm just concerned about that transition to college and loneliness, too.

1152
03:23:06,322 --> 03:23:11,505
For some kids, when they go off, we put so much, hey, we're going to college, and then all of a sudden they get there, and it's kind of a little lonely sometimes.

1153
03:23:12,345 --> 03:23:14,206
So we do touch upon that in 10th grade.

1154
03:23:14,406 --> 03:23:20,630
Last year we actually had Armstrong Ambulance come in and they did a training for all of our seniors going off to college.

1155
03:23:21,010 --> 03:23:24,532
They talked about, you know, drugs, drug use, overdoses.

1156
03:23:25,033 --> 03:23:27,374
They learned how to do CPR, first aid.

1157
03:23:28,775 --> 03:23:34,458
So that was actually something that we started last year to help those students transitioning from senior year into college.

1158
03:23:35,896 --> 03:23:41,338
Um, also, I just wondered that those two speakers who were there that night, um, have they come and spoken?

1159
03:23:41,438 --> 03:23:47,020
I know that they both expressed willingness to me or to others, uh, to come and talk directly to students.

1160
03:23:47,580 --> 03:23:52,782
And I've wondered if, um, I haven't gotten anything.

1161
03:23:52,822 --> 03:23:56,283
I'm sure you have the names and they certainly expressed their willingness to me.

1162
03:23:56,323 --> 03:23:59,244
And I think that we might, um, it might be valuable.

1163
03:24:00,885 --> 03:24:03,386
I apologize for not including the, um,

1164
03:24:04,372 --> 03:24:07,714
naloxone training to seniors and also to our vocational students.

1165
03:24:09,495 --> 03:24:11,836
We do a lot of stuff.

1166
03:24:12,356 --> 03:24:20,660
That's a big one though because it does start to talk about this missing population, 18 to 28 year olds I would say.

1167
03:24:20,680 --> 03:24:23,121
You know one of the things that we're doing that's

1168
03:24:24,822 --> 03:24:26,644
Really a big cornerstone in our offices.

1169
03:24:26,684 --> 03:24:39,738
We're doing a lot of work working with trying to address overdose rates in the trades and so we've worked with Heidi had last year did a great job of getting us in and we had that and

1170
03:24:40,038 --> 03:24:40,798
that conversation.

1171
03:24:40,818 --> 03:24:44,259
So we talked about, you know, dangers on the job.

1172
03:24:44,299 --> 03:24:54,222
We met with all the vocational students that were in co-op and we talked about, you know, injuries on the job, what to do if there's an injury from a tourniquet to how to use naloxone.

1173
03:24:54,883 --> 03:24:59,684
And we had a really great conversation, super bright nursing, you know, CNA students and

1174
03:25:00,124 --> 03:25:02,005
Just really really good conversations there.

1175
03:25:02,025 --> 03:25:12,189
So that's one way that we should be thinking about and continuing to partner about you know working with those employers who are Taking on our students and what are they're doing?

1176
03:25:12,209 --> 03:25:13,209
What are their practices?

1177
03:25:13,249 --> 03:25:15,230
We've created a toolkit for workers on a

1178
03:25:15,590 --> 03:25:19,892
how to understand the laws that pertain to them as well as to their employees.

1179
03:25:20,192 --> 03:25:21,752
So we've done a lot of work around that.

1180
03:25:22,252 --> 03:25:24,693
That gets at the population that's not going off to college.

1181
03:25:25,053 --> 03:25:32,976
But I think that one thing that Danielle from Armstrong Ambulance would say is that the majority of the students were staying in Massachusetts.

1182
03:25:33,457 --> 03:25:43,000
And so it's really about all of us thinking, all of our school systems thinking as a whole about how to teach kids the same information across the board.

1183
03:25:43,325 --> 03:25:46,586
So when they do go to school, they're still taking care of each other and helping each other out.

1184
03:25:47,186 --> 03:25:47,946
Mr. Benedetto.

1185
03:25:48,806 --> 03:25:56,028
So when you're doing that training this year for CPI or first aid, can we add back in training that's already in it?

1186
03:25:56,148 --> 03:25:57,708
It's already there.

1187
03:25:58,069 --> 03:26:01,449
And is that for both the high school and the vocational seniors?

1188
03:26:01,829 --> 03:26:03,170
So so that's great.

1189
03:26:03,310 --> 03:26:04,110
I think that's wonderful.

1190
03:26:04,810 --> 03:26:07,291
And I think Mr. Turgali.

1191
03:26:07,791 --> 03:26:12,372
Yeah, I think that the so in in the school, I think that the reason that

1192
03:26:12,870 --> 03:26:24,193
as you stated many times, the reason that people do dueling so much is just because they think it's not bad and also that it seems clean and they don't think that it's hurtful.

1193
03:26:24,773 --> 03:26:29,774
One thing that I think would be really effective, similar to the 74% of

1194
03:26:32,481 --> 03:26:34,704
Medford students are marijuana free.

1195
03:26:35,746 --> 03:26:39,350
I thought that was really effective just having the facts up there.

1196
03:26:39,771 --> 03:26:43,315
So I think like something that could be really effective in the school

1197
03:26:44,969 --> 03:27:04,344
you know, like maybe picking three or four facts, um, from, you know, like one Juul pod contains as much nicotine as a pack of cigarettes, um, you'd be surprised how many people, uh, pay attention to that, and especially, as you mentioned, um, that, you know, the, the facts are not out there, and people would be really, um,

1198
03:27:05,512 --> 03:27:13,959
You know, it would change the perception of the problem at hand before it really takes root over time.

1199
03:27:14,600 --> 03:27:15,500
So, yeah.

1200
03:27:15,761 --> 03:27:18,983
That's called social norming, and you just identified as scientific.

1201
03:27:20,382 --> 03:27:22,423
You know, research, study, evidence-based, but it works.

1202
03:27:22,463 --> 03:27:30,927
And we have done posters in the past that we believe could have driven those numbers continually down, talking about how many students actually don't use marijuana.

1203
03:27:31,327 --> 03:27:36,930
It's interesting when you are someone who's using substances, your peer group's probably using substances.

1204
03:27:37,030 --> 03:27:39,591
That's the whole entire world is using substances.

1205
03:27:40,011 --> 03:27:41,752
So that's something to be thinking about.

1206
03:27:41,792 --> 03:27:47,275
It's really important to get the facts out there and to really show that there's a lot of kids who just don't do this stuff, a lot of students.

1207
03:27:49,158 --> 03:27:50,419
can you yield to Miss O'Brien?

1208
03:27:50,479 --> 03:27:50,679
Yes.

1209
03:27:51,080 --> 03:27:51,740
Miss O'Brien.

1210
03:27:51,800 --> 03:27:57,305
So back when I was in high school, I was part of the Above the Influence Club for a while with Miss Perry as my advisor.

1211
03:27:57,565 --> 03:28:00,928
And we had Chris Heron come and speak to all the athletes in high school.

1212
03:28:01,269 --> 03:28:01,989
It was mandatory.

1213
03:28:02,029 --> 03:28:05,913
You couldn't even play the spring sport unless you went and saw Chris Heron.

1214
03:28:06,053 --> 03:28:16,082
And I think that was such a positive thing for us as high schoolers to see someone who's young and who overcame something and made something of his life, who

1215
03:28:16,562 --> 03:28:19,303
was rich at one point and then totally went somewhere else.

1216
03:28:19,363 --> 03:28:28,024
And I feel like that would be so beneficial to have a motivational speaker come in, not even just the athletes, but to everyone in the school should have the opportunity to come see someone.

1217
03:28:28,465 --> 03:28:30,905
Because it's not just the athletes that fall out of track, you know?

1218
03:28:31,225 --> 03:28:31,785
It's everyone.

1219
03:28:31,925 --> 03:28:34,466
And I think a motivational speaker would be totally helpful.

1220
03:28:34,486 --> 03:28:39,247
Because Chris Herron, I know, like my friends, when we left, we were like, oh my gosh, like wow.

1221
03:28:39,987 --> 03:28:44,070
I know Mary Burke's daughter was on the lacrosse team with me and she, it was just amazing.

1222
03:28:44,110 --> 03:28:51,695
It was an amazing experience and I think the children would really benefit from that and I think we should not even open it to just the high school, it should be the middle school too.

1223
03:28:51,795 --> 03:28:52,116
Absolutely.

1224
03:28:52,656 --> 03:29:01,242
And me being a young teacher and wanting to teach in Medford, I think we have such a strong community and we're so tight bonded and I'm so tight bonded with everyone in the community.

1225
03:29:01,262 --> 03:29:03,544
I feel like I can talk to anyone here and I want to be able to

1226
03:29:05,078 --> 03:29:10,880
I don't know how to put it, but have people be able to come and talk to the teachers and be comfortable with everyone.

1227
03:29:11,220 --> 03:29:14,901
And I think a motivational speaker coming in would be just a great aspect.

1228
03:29:14,941 --> 03:29:15,641
I don't know how Ms.

1229
03:29:15,661 --> 03:29:16,901
Carey got Chris Hirons.

1230
03:29:16,922 --> 03:29:21,683
Maybe she could come about that again, but I know he does motivational speaking all the time.

1231
03:29:21,723 --> 03:29:22,483
I follow him on Twitter.

1232
03:29:22,503 --> 03:29:23,403
I think he's amazing.

1233
03:29:24,084 --> 03:29:24,704
And yeah.

1234
03:29:25,384 --> 03:29:26,784
Great recommendation, Hannah.

1235
03:29:28,165 --> 03:29:28,705
Mr. Carey.

1236
03:29:29,313 --> 03:29:34,301
May I throw you to Sebastian, this is your next great story, your next great lead in the Mustang News.

1237
03:29:34,862 --> 03:29:39,369
It's their posters, you know, get it in print and shoot for our Pulitzer.

1238
03:29:41,312 --> 03:29:55,697
I think that one in our report that one stat about one jewel can have whatever it was contains as much nicotine as a pack of cigarettes.

1239
03:29:55,917 --> 03:29:59,398
It's just so striking that it is time for us.

1240
03:29:59,438 --> 03:30:00,699
We have a graphics arts department.

1241
03:30:00,739 --> 03:30:02,280
We can get some posters made up.

1242
03:30:03,000 --> 03:30:05,981
I think that that would be incredibly valuable to right away get out.

1243
03:30:06,221 --> 03:30:11,804
I think you should also know that one of those pods is like $4, like four or five bucks.

1244
03:30:12,765 --> 03:30:15,406
So a lot cheaper than a pack.

1245
03:30:15,426 --> 03:30:18,268
No taxes, or is it a tax on that stuff?

1246
03:30:18,368 --> 03:30:19,028
No, it's online.

1247
03:30:19,088 --> 03:30:20,769
I don't know if it's taxed.

1248
03:30:21,130 --> 03:30:22,350
It's sales tax.

1249
03:30:22,670 --> 03:30:26,353
So our community, the Board of Health passed that you cannot sell to minors.

1250
03:30:26,393 --> 03:30:26,613
Right.

1251
03:30:26,653 --> 03:30:27,013
God bless you.

1252
03:30:27,033 --> 03:30:27,473
God bless you.

1253
03:30:28,814 --> 03:30:30,355
I think that's a good point.

1254
03:30:30,375 --> 03:30:31,655
And just one last point for Sebastian.

1255
03:30:31,695 --> 03:30:32,836
There was information.

1256
03:30:32,876 --> 03:30:42,181
There was a great article a couple of weeks ago on the globe regarding dueling and its effects and what they know so far, so you might want to research that.

1257
03:30:42,201 --> 03:30:46,243
Come up with your own conclusions and get a story out there for us.

1258
03:30:46,423 --> 03:30:46,803
That's good.

1259
03:30:46,823 --> 03:30:47,463
Thank you.

1260
03:30:47,483 --> 03:30:48,144
Miss Van de Kloot.

1261
03:30:48,284 --> 03:30:48,484
Yes.

1262
03:30:48,544 --> 03:30:52,846
No, I just wondered if we can also I don't know whether I should make it as a form of a motion, but maybe we could

1263
03:30:58,194 --> 03:30:59,575
Motion on the fly second.

1264
03:31:00,736 --> 03:31:04,059
On the motions that have been offered thus far, all those in favor?

1265
03:31:04,220 --> 03:31:04,740
Aye.

1266
03:31:04,840 --> 03:31:05,601
All those opposed?

1267
03:31:06,041 --> 03:31:08,944
Motion passes, including a motivational speaker.

1268
03:31:12,366 --> 03:31:15,628
Mr. Ruggiero, school committee man-elect.

1269
03:31:16,828 --> 03:31:17,608
I have two questions.

1270
03:31:18,549 --> 03:31:29,454
The first is so the alcohol use from the 6th to 8th grade dropped pretty precipitously from 2011 to 2013 and I was wondering what accounts for that drop.

1271
03:31:30,034 --> 03:31:33,456
And the second thing I had is maybe just helping us understand the analytics.

1272
03:31:33,476 --> 03:31:35,897
So you have children completing a survey

1273
03:31:37,450 --> 03:31:46,792
Do we have any sense of how many people are actually users but are concerned that if they fill out this survey and profit with this information will be seen by a teacher that they're handing it in?

1274
03:31:47,592 --> 03:31:49,333
Do we have like a sense of like heroin use?

1275
03:31:49,373 --> 03:31:52,393
I know overdose is a serious issue in Medford.

1276
03:31:52,613 --> 03:31:57,194
So do we have a sense of underage heroin overdoses in Medford?

1277
03:31:57,354 --> 03:31:59,775
There are no underage heroin overdoses in Medford.

1278
03:32:01,275 --> 03:32:04,436
There was an individual who's 19 that overdosed and

1279
03:32:05,054 --> 03:32:06,855
died in Medford, they were from another community.

1280
03:32:06,955 --> 03:32:07,876
So that's something to know.

1281
03:32:11,698 --> 03:32:13,579
So I have it here at the bottom.

1282
03:32:13,679 --> 03:32:25,747
But these numbers are so small that it's very, you have to really think about that, that this is like .1% of the entire population that took it reported.

1283
03:32:25,767 --> 03:32:26,827
That could be one student.

1284
03:32:27,388 --> 03:32:29,569
So there's something to think about when you're looking at that data.

1285
03:32:30,049 --> 03:32:30,630
So it's there.

1286
03:32:31,891 --> 03:32:33,732
But your question is about,

1287
03:32:35,276 --> 03:32:37,637
Oh, what was the drop?

1288
03:32:37,937 --> 03:32:39,337
The drop was pretty significant.

1289
03:32:39,377 --> 03:32:42,018
If you have 10%, that's a significant selection.

1290
03:32:42,038 --> 03:32:42,619
It is a significant drop.

1291
03:32:42,659 --> 03:32:47,560
And what we saw at that time was we saw an increase in parental monitoring.

1292
03:32:48,541 --> 03:32:57,664
If you were to look at the risk and protective factors, we talked about in 2011, there were some protective factors that were very low in the middle schools.

1293
03:32:58,044 --> 03:33:02,549
And by the next year, they were exactly even with their sister scores.

1294
03:33:03,309 --> 03:33:14,020
So the deal was is that there were many opportunities for rewards if you do something in the school, but there weren't very many opportunities.

1295
03:33:14,580 --> 03:33:26,685
So when those two came together and they were even that we talked about at the school committee meeting, we talked about it with the principals, there was a whole influx of new activities after school activities that started to happen.

1296
03:33:27,265 --> 03:33:30,006
Those numbers became aligned and we saw that number drop.

1297
03:33:30,026 --> 03:33:32,347
So parents were monitoring their kids.

1298
03:33:33,007 --> 03:33:38,653
more closely, the schools addressed some of the pro-social things that needed to be addressed in the community.

1299
03:33:39,694 --> 03:33:44,919
It was a real sort of like chasm of everybody working together, I think, and that really helped drive those numbers down.

1300
03:33:46,220 --> 03:33:50,485
And do you have a sense of how many kids are using but don't report on the survey?

1301
03:33:51,065 --> 03:33:54,649
So that's just sort of a given with these surveys, right?

1302
03:33:56,584 --> 03:34:05,889
To be honest with you, a lot of people who are using substances know very well that they don't want to be using substances, and so they do self-report pretty accurately on these surveys.

1303
03:34:06,209 --> 03:34:15,734
They may not want to be forthcoming with someone that knows them and may feel shame if they were to report, but when it's anonymous, it's secretive.

1304
03:34:15,814 --> 03:34:18,395
They actually do fill them out pretty accurately, at least that's what

1305
03:34:19,256 --> 03:34:22,141
nationally, that's what the story has been.

1306
03:34:22,161 --> 03:34:26,628
I don't have the exact scientific fact for you, but that's what I do know.

1307
03:34:28,052 --> 03:34:28,452
very good.

1308
03:34:28,633 --> 03:34:30,494
Is there a motion to receive this report?

1309
03:34:30,554 --> 03:34:31,075
One more question.

1310
03:34:31,095 --> 03:34:31,195
Ms.

1311
03:34:31,235 --> 03:34:31,555
Cuno.

1312
03:34:31,695 --> 03:34:39,963
Actually, I was just thinking of the bullet points that we were talking about, whether it be Sebastian or both of you, is the other one about getting into our vehicle.

1313
03:34:40,464 --> 03:34:40,684
Yes.

1314
03:34:40,964 --> 03:34:42,305
With someone who's been vaping.

1315
03:34:42,546 --> 03:34:43,286
Yeah.

1316
03:34:43,366 --> 03:34:46,209
Which is very important and it's very serious.

1317
03:34:47,190 --> 03:34:51,734
And I think that would be a bullet point really to put out there because I don't think

1318
03:34:52,715 --> 03:34:54,836
People are aware of how serious that could be.

1319
03:34:55,356 --> 03:35:04,079
Because we're, you know, we've been trained in our mind, and as kids we've been trained in our minds too, is, you know, you don't get into a vehicle with someone who's been drinking.

1320
03:35:04,159 --> 03:35:04,339
Right.

1321
03:35:04,639 --> 03:35:05,839
No one's been talking about this.

1322
03:35:05,919 --> 03:35:07,040
This is, you know, newer.

1323
03:35:07,460 --> 03:35:10,001
So I think that's definitely a point we need to put out there.

1324
03:35:10,301 --> 03:35:10,481
Yeah.

1325
03:35:10,761 --> 03:35:12,902
I think it's a really important one to talk about for sure.

1326
03:35:14,002 --> 03:35:17,872
Very good on the motion this report being received and placed on file all those in favor.

1327
03:35:17,952 --> 03:35:18,433
Aye.

1328
03:35:18,734 --> 03:35:19,375
All those opposed.

1329
03:35:19,395 --> 03:35:20,819
Thank you so much.

1330
03:35:20,839 --> 03:35:21,962
Thank you very much.

1331
03:35:26,724 --> 03:35:29,965
Okay, motion to revert to the regular order of business.

1332
03:35:30,266 --> 03:35:31,066
All those in favor?

1333
03:35:31,126 --> 03:35:31,426
Aye.

1334
03:35:31,546 --> 03:35:32,386
All those opposed?

1335
03:35:32,867 --> 03:35:33,667
Motion passes.

1336
03:35:34,147 --> 03:35:39,649
Report one, recommendation to approve Meffitt High School, Meffitt-Vogue Tech High School graduation date and location.

1337
03:35:39,689 --> 03:35:40,110
Move approval.

1338
03:35:40,130 --> 03:35:40,950
Motion to approve.

1339
03:35:40,990 --> 03:35:43,671
Superintendent, well, you want me just to announce the date?

1340
03:35:43,711 --> 03:35:54,556
Well, we can just make one quick comment, as we've done this at this place every year for a long time now, and the reason we need to approve it so early is that if we have snow days,

1341
03:35:55,376 --> 03:35:56,657
you know, we've locked in the date.

1342
03:35:57,277 --> 03:36:01,059
So we don't have to have, you know, so many days.

1343
03:36:01,159 --> 03:36:03,320
But if there are no snow days, we don't have to worry about it.

1344
03:36:03,900 --> 03:36:13,685
And the other thing, the other thing that I just want to let you know is that Mr. William Cummings of the Cummings Foundation will speak at graduation in addition to the normal speakers.

1345
03:36:13,705 --> 03:36:14,545
That's exciting.

1346
03:36:15,286 --> 03:36:15,626
Excellent.

1347
03:36:15,666 --> 03:36:19,288
So June 6, all those parents out there, at 6 p.m.

1348
03:36:19,328 --> 03:36:21,589
at the Gancher Center at Tufts University.

1349
03:36:22,907 --> 03:36:25,352
Motion to approve Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Ms.

1350
03:36:25,372 --> 03:36:25,773
Kretz.

1351
03:36:25,853 --> 03:36:26,675
All those in favor?

1352
03:36:26,695 --> 03:36:27,116
Aye.

1353
03:36:27,436 --> 03:36:28,078
All those opposed?

1354
03:36:28,278 --> 03:36:29,060
Motion passes.

1355
03:36:31,004 --> 03:36:32,106
Financial report.

1356
03:36:32,166 --> 03:36:32,346
Ms.

1357
03:36:32,386 --> 03:36:32,787
Patterson.

1358
03:36:36,892 --> 03:36:43,434
So this is our first quarterly or close to one third of the year report on our financials.

1359
03:36:44,235 --> 03:36:48,016
The general fund operating budget for FY18 is $56,431,000, of which year to date we have spent 42%, 42.9%, which is a total of $24,215,786.

1360
03:36:48,076 --> 03:36:51,377
And that includes both our expenditures and our encumbrances, which is reserving funds for

1361
03:37:06,596 --> 03:37:08,517
anticipated and projected expenses.

1362
03:37:09,538 --> 03:37:22,928
So of the amount spent to date, our 10-month biweekly employees have received nine of their checks since August 28th, with an additional special run in October to accommodate the anticipated number of checks per calendar year.

1363
03:37:23,748 --> 03:37:29,773
And all 12-month employees have received 11 of their paychecks since July 1, the first start of the new fiscal year.

1364
03:37:30,956 --> 03:37:36,759
So we have many staff members out on maternity leave with some additional expected in the spring.

1365
03:37:36,879 --> 03:37:37,859
Currently we have nine.

1366
03:37:38,519 --> 03:37:45,843
So there are some significant coverages that we're maintaining that is also long term sub capacities.

1367
03:37:47,424 --> 03:37:59,407
And while there has been significant transition for teaching and other staff members during this school year, we have been able to fill the positions based on the program needs and will continue to do so as those arise.

1368
03:38:01,148 --> 03:38:03,628
The business office is fully staffed.

1369
03:38:04,008 --> 03:38:09,270
We transitioned from some various leaves and had significant turnover over the summer.

1370
03:38:09,850 --> 03:38:17,787
So we are in the process of reclassifying our payroll codes to reflect correct budget items and be in line with

1371
03:38:18,297 --> 03:38:20,858
where they were reflected for the departmental charges.

1372
03:38:21,719 --> 03:38:37,768
We are also excited and encouraged to be rolling out and implementing a new automated onboarding process that's for the hiring and tracking that will greatly improve our laborious process for new hires and streamlining documentation.

1373
03:38:38,128 --> 03:38:39,709
This will also be rolled out to

1374
03:38:40,249 --> 03:38:55,559
current employees for data changes and updates, and it is a subsequent system for the current attendance ASOP system that we use with Frontline, and it will also include a mobile app, so that will greatly improve utilization.

1375
03:38:57,028 --> 03:39:24,086
So as we continue to respond to the DESE, Department of Ed chart of account change structures, as well as additional reporting components that they have for us, we have to report and track expenses by a number of different areas, which include by school, by function code, by category, district wide, and expanding out to individual grants, the higher level grants, such as Title I and special education.

1376
03:39:25,222 --> 03:39:38,383
So within the operating budget where some budget columns may be zero, the planned cost projections are included in those breakout items and the balances within each function remain to be positive.

1377
03:39:39,150 --> 03:39:50,576
So we please also note that the encumbrance column, it does include amounts that we have included our best projections for year end expenditures.

1378
03:39:50,976 --> 03:39:59,900
So those will continue to be monitored, liquidated and updated as costs are trued up as the invoices come in and actual payments are relieved.

1379
03:40:00,800 --> 03:40:05,723
So included with the summary are some of the key program areas within our general fund.

1380
03:40:06,661 --> 03:40:09,923
The first of which is the largest component of our budget is salaries.

1381
03:40:11,043 --> 03:40:18,767
In fiscal year 2018, we have two salary increments that were awarded for the collective bargaining units.

1382
03:40:18,887 --> 03:40:23,109
The first was in July and or the start of their contract.

1383
03:40:23,669 --> 03:40:30,572
And the second increase will be in January for the appropriate CBA groups.

1384
03:40:30,652 --> 03:40:31,393
And that will be another 1%.

1385
03:40:33,007 --> 03:40:40,295
So the undistributed allocation will be dispersed among the budget adjustments for different program areas.

1386
03:40:40,355 --> 03:40:51,627
So as we identify the increases in certain areas, we'll be reallocating some of those amounts for personnel changes, retirement buybacks and the such.

1387
03:40:53,484 --> 03:40:55,765
Another area of interest is security.

1388
03:40:56,345 --> 03:41:02,106
Large investments have been made to replace and repair the security cameras throughout the district at all buildings.

1389
03:41:03,107 --> 03:41:10,269
So the amount of $194,949 within the budget is earmarked for the security program reporting area.

1390
03:41:10,769 --> 03:41:14,610
However, it will most likely be shifted to a capital account once appropriated.

1391
03:41:16,281 --> 03:41:22,747
We expect that the projects will be completed at all schools by mid-December, and we will follow up with a detailed report.

1392
03:41:23,728 --> 03:41:31,114
There have been many schools that have finalized the completion of those repairs, and we will be updating as they

1393
03:41:31,803 --> 03:41:32,943
And then we'll be able to finalize as well.

1394
03:41:33,544 --> 03:41:46,089
So security in the buildings is a priority, and the district continues to demonstrate its commitment to ensuring safety in the multiple areas, and that includes our staffing, training our staff members, cameras, security cameras.

1395
03:41:46,709 --> 03:41:53,272
And identification stops at entrance locations, which include the Raptor license scanning and name tag system.

1396
03:41:55,112 --> 03:41:57,393
Our technology is another significant area

1397
03:41:59,724 --> 03:42:06,790
committee decided to infuse the system with significant funding at each of the school systems at each school building.

1398
03:42:07,510 --> 03:42:18,039
There was 15,000 earmarked for the high school level, 5,000 for Curtis Tufts, 15,000 for the middle schools, and 13,000 for each elementary school, which was significant.

1399
03:42:18,799 --> 03:42:33,734
We utilized those funds and used some high volume discounts along with state bid pricing to maximize the investment within those technology area and rolled out over the summer to have the carts and units available for the start of school.

1400
03:42:34,335 --> 03:42:41,822
So in total we had 455 devices, new devices for this school year that were rolled out for use in each of the buildings.

1401
03:42:43,246 --> 03:42:50,128
And additionally, within technology, we just received the E-rate approval that will further improve connectivity district-wide.

1402
03:42:50,828 --> 03:43:00,431
And we're hoping the matching dollars that were requested from the city will be approved and we'll be able to continue the technology investment throughout school year 2018.

1403
03:43:03,103 --> 03:43:06,284
Transportation continues to be a large item.

1404
03:43:07,224 --> 03:43:16,046
We are currently in year three of the original three-year contract with Eastern Bus, and we have an additional two years locked in at specified rates for that contract.

1405
03:43:16,846 --> 03:43:20,126
The budget reflects an anticipated reduction of one bus.

1406
03:43:20,727 --> 03:43:32,369
However, we did have to bring bus number 18 back into the cycle due to the shift in newcomers programs, and so we've had to utilize the additional bus for that.

1407
03:43:33,052 --> 03:43:39,793
So it shows a negative amount within that category based on the need for additional transportation.

1408
03:43:40,994 --> 03:43:46,395
We also have absorbed the cost for students that attend the Minuteman Vocational School.

1409
03:43:47,135 --> 03:43:52,356
And the amount we expect will be covered by the reduced enrollment in the tuition.

1410
03:43:52,436 --> 03:44:02,518
So where we had projected additional students going out and the offset coming in for the transportation will net itself out.

1411
03:44:03,664 --> 03:44:10,168
We currently provide after school buses to the middle schools, and that's per contract that was identified in the original contract.

1412
03:44:10,548 --> 03:44:15,671
Three buses per day, and that's for 70 days throughout the school year.

1413
03:44:16,272 --> 03:44:31,521
We've also indicated that should the elementary schools be considering additional after school programs, there would be some additional costs realized with that, and we would need to work with the provider for the levels of

1414
03:44:33,345 --> 03:44:40,513
trips and participation and timing of those trips because the routes are all intertwined and combined.

1415
03:44:40,573 --> 03:44:52,067
So there may be possibility for an additional contractor at that point if it was decided and determined to go forward with that additional expense in the transportation area.

1416
03:44:53,444 --> 03:44:58,768
are utilities, which covers natural gas, electricity, water.

1417
03:44:59,769 --> 03:45:07,255
We encumber the utilities based on historical years of usage, and we budget conservatively for unexpected occurrences.

1418
03:45:08,243 --> 03:45:11,085
So our natural gas rates have been very favorable.

1419
03:45:11,705 --> 03:45:15,248
Utilization has been lower due to milder winters.

1420
03:45:15,408 --> 03:45:22,292
However, we still have not experienced the cold months for this fiscal year, so we're not quite sure how that will land.

1421
03:45:23,153 --> 03:45:37,082
Electricity continues to be volatile in the marketplace, and we will be expecting a slightly higher rate beginning next fiscal year, which we have locked in with City Hall working with the Power Options Company.

1422
03:45:37,782 --> 03:45:46,406
So our current rate is slightly lower, which is for the supply cost at 0.0882 per kilowatt hour.

1423
03:45:46,987 --> 03:45:50,328
Moving into next fiscal year, we'll have 0.0931.

1424
03:45:51,369 --> 03:45:58,473
So definitely moving forward as we budget and plan for that, we will need to budget some increases in that area.

1425
03:45:59,673 --> 03:46:03,795
But we have encumbered the entire line item for that account.

1426
03:46:03,915 --> 03:46:04,996
It has typically

1427
03:46:06,092 --> 03:46:08,933
gone to the very end of that particular expense.

1428
03:46:08,973 --> 03:46:13,675
So we want to maintain a conservative estimate and show that fully expended.

1429
03:46:14,835 --> 03:46:22,498
So in summary, the first financial report shows that the expenditures are in line with our budget projections.

1430
03:46:22,798 --> 03:46:24,979
We will continue to monitor and review them.

1431
03:46:25,839 --> 03:46:32,582
And we constantly look at consolidating purchases, utilizing state bids when we can.

1432
03:46:33,257 --> 03:46:36,120
and the like and identifying savings wherever possible.

1433
03:46:36,581 --> 03:46:47,592
And I'd like to again thank City Hall, my counterparts at the hall that communication, cooperation has been very effective in helping us accomplish what we need to get done.

1434
03:46:49,549 --> 03:46:50,610
Thank you.

1435
03:46:51,670 --> 03:46:52,911
Christina, I had one question.

1436
03:46:52,991 --> 03:46:58,473
Could you please explain what you mean by we are reclassifying payroll codes to reflect correct budget lines?

1437
03:46:58,913 --> 03:46:59,153
Yes.

1438
03:46:59,313 --> 03:47:03,355
So our payroll system is not linked with our financial system.

1439
03:47:03,475 --> 03:47:05,596
So we outsource payroll.

1440
03:47:05,656 --> 03:47:08,417
So we have to identify a payroll code that is

1441
03:47:09,266 --> 03:47:12,348
crosswalk to our general ledger code, a financial software code.

1442
03:47:12,969 --> 03:47:24,937
So those codes, which was a much smaller code number, may not necessarily be aligned with what our either newly identified budget financial account code is, general ledger account.

1443
03:47:25,337 --> 03:47:36,265
So we're going through now and really scouring those areas to look at some anomalies that might be occurring and to make sure that where we budgeted individuals based on department

1444
03:47:36,707 --> 03:47:40,414
school wide that they are correctly classified in in the payroll code.

1445
03:47:40,555 --> 03:47:48,330
Okay so it doesn't mean that somebody who was added to the business office on or transferred in the role was given different classification.

1446
03:47:48,780 --> 03:47:49,941
No, no, no, no.

1447
03:47:49,981 --> 03:47:52,044
This is strictly an accounting function.

1448
03:47:52,364 --> 03:48:00,573
So identifying the crosswalk from our payroll system to our general fund accounting system.

1449
03:48:00,833 --> 03:48:00,953
Ms.

1450
03:48:01,013 --> 03:48:02,014
Kratz.

1451
03:48:02,135 --> 03:48:03,156
Thank you, Christine.

1452
03:48:03,296 --> 03:48:04,037
Thank you for the reports.

1453
03:48:04,117 --> 03:48:04,517
Excellent.

1454
03:48:04,878 --> 03:48:06,459
I just have one question.

1455
03:48:06,599 --> 03:48:08,722
It does mention, I was going to ask about the cameras.

1456
03:48:09,122 --> 03:48:13,446
So it mentions that a large investment was made to replace and repair security cameras.

1457
03:48:13,986 --> 03:48:23,414
And I know a lot of us were getting emails throughout the fall where a lot of parents were very concerned because a lot of cameras were out and they weren't operating.

1458
03:48:23,775 --> 03:48:32,542
So are there any cameras that are still in need of repair or were all the cameras that were malfunctioning and not operating?

1459
03:48:32,967 --> 03:48:34,328
were they all repaired?

1460
03:48:34,688 --> 03:48:42,515
So we've addressed all of the inoperable cameras that were the critical areas for observation.

1461
03:48:43,015 --> 03:48:47,639
So all of those have been addressed with the investment that we have provided.

1462
03:48:48,079 --> 03:48:52,162
They are not all currently complete, as the contractor is still working on them.

1463
03:48:52,703 --> 03:49:01,230
So they have several teams at several locations, and they anticipate being complete in the next couple of weeks.

1464
03:49:02,267 --> 03:49:04,269
Can I ask a point of clarification?

1465
03:49:04,830 --> 03:49:05,831
Thank you.

1466
03:49:07,012 --> 03:49:09,374
So you said the key point cameras.

1467
03:49:09,395 --> 03:49:14,740
Does that mean all cameras are now online and working or just key point?

1468
03:49:15,020 --> 03:49:15,641
No, no.

1469
03:49:15,781 --> 03:49:25,051
As I mentioned, it's that repairs and replacements have not all been done to this date, to date right now for reporting back to you.

1470
03:49:25,803 --> 03:49:49,445
Many of the schools have been and they are in process right now So that's where we will be finalizing the update in a couple of weeks when they are complete So they did I believe the Roberts is complete some of the other highly critical areas, but the larger Projects that were greater in scale are still ongoing so they're in in the process of being

1471
03:49:50,071 --> 03:49:51,072
repaired and replaced.

1472
03:49:51,292 --> 03:49:54,356
Do we have a completion hopeful date?

1473
03:49:54,636 --> 03:49:55,057
Two weeks.

1474
03:49:55,617 --> 03:50:04,047
And then all cameras within the district will be up and running and functioning appropriately?

1475
03:50:04,928 --> 03:50:08,552
I think that it's really important to understand that cameras are fragile.

1476
03:50:09,788 --> 03:50:22,140
and that every year we're going to have to allocate money for this because lightning strikes, all kinds of things take place that are beyond our control and we can go all year long and then find that we need.

1477
03:50:23,180 --> 03:50:25,441
cameras that have to be replaced going into the school year.

1478
03:50:25,481 --> 03:50:33,867
So I think the key thing, you know, apropos to your question is, is that are we covering the areas that people need to be, have covered, that people can see?

1479
03:50:33,907 --> 03:50:34,927
The answer is yes.

1480
03:50:36,708 --> 03:50:41,771
And we'll try to, you know, continually prioritize as we go forward.

1481
03:50:41,811 --> 03:50:46,954
If a camera goes down, we certainly want to ensure that a key area is covered.

1482
03:50:47,014 --> 03:50:51,257
So rather than one that might be a duplicate of an existing area.

1483
03:50:53,345 --> 03:50:57,306
For the most part, in the middle of December, we believe everything will be fixed.

1484
03:50:59,027 --> 03:51:13,231
Just as another follow-up, I know that Attorney Bill O'Keefe offered to supply us with extra cameras, and even if we have them as a stash of backup cameras, he's more than willing to donate them.

1485
03:51:13,271 --> 03:51:15,552
He has in the past, and he has more to donate.

1486
03:51:15,612 --> 03:51:18,153
So I'm making a motion now.

1487
03:51:19,054 --> 03:51:26,800
that the superintendent reach out to him and just see if they're functioning with our system now and if it's appropriate to have them as backup cameras.

1488
03:51:27,121 --> 03:51:29,443
Let me answer that before we go too far down the road.

1489
03:51:30,463 --> 03:51:34,627
Mr. O'Keefe did provide a substantial number, 30 additional cameras this year.

1490
03:51:35,108 --> 03:51:37,049
Some of them are not compatible with what we need.

1491
03:51:37,610 --> 03:51:43,114
Some of them can be used for limited purposes, but given what we're doing right now and given the upgrade in technology,

1492
03:51:44,055 --> 03:51:52,679
Um, what's coming out of that institution that Bill gets it from, uh, is not necessarily compatible with what we've got.

1493
03:51:52,699 --> 03:51:57,362
There's a few that can be, so we've got to screen them out, but we really can't be overly dependent on that.

1494
03:51:57,842 --> 03:52:12,049
We appreciate what Bill's done, but on the other hand, we've got to be careful that, uh, they're mostly inside cameras, and the things that deal with outside cameras are very different, and we're also dealing with a different way of, uh, of a transmission, uh, than we previously did.

1495
03:52:13,730 --> 03:52:18,256
We can use them periodically, but it's not a one-to-one kind of application, but we do appreciate it.

1496
03:52:18,396 --> 03:52:18,857
All right.

1497
03:52:18,897 --> 03:52:21,401
I also make a motion to send him a thank you note.

1498
03:52:21,861 --> 03:52:23,724
I think we did once, but I'll send it again.

1499
03:52:23,744 --> 03:52:30,033
Consistently over the years providing us with any technology that comes to his hands.

1500
03:52:31,028 --> 03:53:00,047
So that was the security issue I was I wanted some clarity on the business office team and now that it's fully staffed What types of movement will happen were there any positions added like I'm just curious I know we talked about HR person at one point the superintendent mentioned something like that I just was wondering what what that looks like now or maybe we could even get like, you know, a workshop plan.

1501
03:53:00,128 --> 03:53:00,328
Yeah.

1502
03:53:00,388 --> 03:53:00,688
Thank you

1503
03:53:01,448 --> 03:53:02,589
you want to talk about that?

1504
03:53:02,609 --> 03:53:03,490
Absolutely with that.

1505
03:53:03,750 --> 03:53:06,332
So we had a maternity leave that was not covered.

1506
03:53:07,032 --> 03:53:08,233
So we were understaffed.

1507
03:53:08,734 --> 03:53:14,938
We also had transition from one of our team members who went to another department within the school.

1508
03:53:15,659 --> 03:53:20,722
We had to, uh, fill another payroll position, so there's been nothing added.

1509
03:53:21,242 --> 03:53:25,065
We've been backfilling and trying to maintain and keep keep the

1510
03:53:30,822 --> 03:53:35,004
a replacement for an open position that had, um, transferred.

1511
03:53:35,605 --> 03:53:44,329
Can we see that chart anyway, just so, as committee members, we have an idea of what the roles are, who's in, like, who's in those roles.

1512
03:53:44,369 --> 03:53:51,673
Yeah, that would be helpful, because if we have any questions moving forward, of course we'd go to the superintendent, but, you know, it's just to know.

1513
03:53:51,833 --> 03:53:52,974
Names and job titles.

1514
03:53:52,994 --> 03:53:54,275
Yeah, that would be great.

1515
03:53:54,555 --> 03:53:54,875
Thank you.

1516
03:53:57,225 --> 03:54:03,349
have expectations of coming forward with a proposal as the year progresses to enhance our human resources capacity.

1517
03:54:03,829 --> 03:54:12,535
I mean, it's become a major, major area, and you cannot continue to just simply treat it as a, you know, byproduct of everything else going on.

1518
03:54:12,615 --> 03:54:15,837
So that will come forward as a major proposal, and we'll have that discussion.

1519
03:54:18,563 --> 03:54:33,216
I just also want to speak about the community schools budget, and I know that the committee approved almost two years ago about having it quarterly, so just as a friendly reminder that I'd like to see that coming forward soon.

1520
03:54:33,236 --> 03:54:33,576
We will.

1521
03:54:34,357 --> 03:54:35,158
Thank you very much.

1522
03:54:35,238 --> 03:54:42,544
Maybe we can even add it to the list of items on the back of our agenda so we don't forget, because I might forget if it's not written.

1523
03:54:42,644 --> 03:54:43,004
Thank you.

1524
03:54:43,024 --> 03:54:44,766
I doubt you're going to forget.

1525
03:54:48,213 --> 03:54:58,343
.

1526
03:54:48,233 --> 03:54:58,343
Thank you very much is there a motion on the floor to accept this motion to accept the report place on file yes seconded by miss van de Kloet along with a thank you.

1527
03:54:58,363 --> 03:55:01,466
To keep all those in favor hi all those opposed.

1528
03:55:02,246 --> 03:55:02,987
Motion granted.

1529
03:55:03,007 --> 03:55:05,750
Thank you Christine okay thank you Kirsten.

1530
03:55:07,391 --> 03:55:09,253
Item number three report on bilingual

1531
03:55:12,626 --> 03:55:24,190
So, as you probably know, the state legislature has approved an option for school districts to incorporate bilingual education into the existing SEI format.

1532
03:55:24,950 --> 03:55:38,334
Now, 15 years ago, Ron Unz, who came from California, pushed an initiative petition, which previously had some success in Arizona and California, and Massachusetts decided that it would adopt it as well.

1533
03:55:39,434 --> 03:55:46,238
It was given great support from John Silber at the time, and also Mitt Romney, who was a gubernatorial candidate, and it carried its way.

1534
03:55:47,158 --> 03:55:49,839
Since the time it's been implemented, there's been mixed results.

1535
03:55:51,560 --> 03:56:07,908
Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, but it comes with that whole idea that, you know, everyone should speak English, and we believe they should, but how to learn to speak English, especially to learn subjects that require deep cognitive knowledge, cognitive language, is not so easily done.

1536
03:56:09,128 --> 03:56:12,970
And there are reasons for blending and doing things a little bit differently.

1537
03:56:14,870 --> 03:56:16,711
We obviously are looking at that.

1538
03:56:16,751 --> 03:56:24,534
We're going to be waiting for the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education to give us the latest guidelines as they see them.

1539
03:56:24,594 --> 03:56:25,614
And we haven't seen them yet.

1540
03:56:25,674 --> 03:56:29,796
We probably won't see them until either late spring or perhaps even into the summer.

1541
03:56:30,416 --> 03:56:34,898
So I doubt there's going to be much done in the next fiscal year.

1542
03:56:36,218 --> 03:56:51,807
We are going to look at the blend of programs and that Paul is going to come up in a minute and talk about that and how it comes together so that we can take advantage of the law where it's appropriate while at the same time not lose track of situations which are best served by the current SEI.

1543
03:56:52,768 --> 03:56:55,870
Also, as you probably know, our teachers have

1544
03:56:56,750 --> 03:57:09,404
been working to get SCI endorsements, which are required now for teachers who work with students who have EL requirements, and the vast majority of faculty members do, especially in the core academic areas.

1545
03:57:09,744 --> 03:57:15,070
However, there's still some gaps, and there's still a need to continue pushing that as people

1546
03:57:15,490 --> 03:57:22,492
receive students who have this English language need to make sure that the teachers are fully prepared for them.

1547
03:57:24,513 --> 03:57:30,795
We also have the issue of dealing with the distribution of students with EL and we're going to look at that.

1548
03:57:30,895 --> 03:57:32,436
We did some distribution this year.

1549
03:57:33,076 --> 03:57:34,436
We'll have some comment about that.

1550
03:57:34,937 --> 03:57:36,157
It's not an easy subject.

1551
03:57:36,277 --> 03:57:40,378
Because as you move people around, you solve one problem, you create another.

1552
03:57:40,818 --> 03:57:52,901
So we're going to provide some options for you in the beginning of the year, sometime in January, so you can look at what options are available to you and what it means financially and what it means programmatically.

1553
03:57:53,701 --> 03:58:00,223
But tonight, we want to give you an idea about the law, the pros, the cons of it, and some of the other things that Paul has put together.

1554
03:58:00,263 --> 03:58:03,904
So with permission, Paul, if you'd come on up and give us a

1555
03:58:05,615 --> 03:58:07,096
A discussion on this topic.

1556
03:58:07,977 --> 03:58:09,038
Good evening, everyone.

1557
03:58:10,399 --> 03:58:18,026
So this bill allows districts to choose what type of programming works best for their communities.

1558
03:58:18,666 --> 03:58:28,795
Unlike the old TBE, they had it set up where it was mandatory if you had 20 or more students who spoke in the language group.

1559
03:58:30,356 --> 03:58:38,640
During that time, students in their first year, it was 20% of instruction was in English, 80% was in the target language.

1560
03:58:38,680 --> 03:58:40,641
Year two, it was a 50-50 split.

1561
03:58:41,001 --> 03:58:47,364
And then year three, it was 20% in the target language and 80%, I'm sorry, 20% in the native language and 80% in the target language.

1562
03:58:51,725 --> 03:58:56,568
We don't know what guidance the state's going to come out with regarding this.

1563
03:58:57,128 --> 03:59:04,931
We have to look at licensure because all of the bilingual licenses were put on hold by DESE 15 years ago when that ended.

1564
03:59:06,412 --> 03:59:08,593
So we don't know what their requirements will be.

1565
03:59:09,193 --> 03:59:09,853
We don't know

1566
03:59:11,714 --> 03:59:14,215
really what their guidance will be with programming.

1567
03:59:15,155 --> 03:59:21,456
It doesn't, my understanding of it as the bill is written, is it doesn't have to be a full-on program as it was in the past.

1568
03:59:21,936 --> 03:59:29,998
We can now have just individual classes that can support our students who speak other languages.

1569
03:59:30,098 --> 03:59:38,140
So as Mr. Belson and I were talking about this initially, we're thinking, you know, start out when we look at our language groups, Portuguese is our highest

1570
03:59:39,520 --> 03:59:42,442
highest number of speakers at the high school.

1571
03:59:43,283 --> 03:59:50,387
Our high school students are at a disadvantage because they have a finite period of time in which to learn language, pass all of their MCAS tests.

1572
03:59:50,407 --> 04:00:06,318
So if we were to introduce something here in Medford, we would look at those protocol, you know, the protocol set out by the Department of Ed, look at our student population, which again, changes on a regular basis, and make those decisions at that time.

1573
04:00:09,295 --> 04:00:09,795
Miss Cuneo.

1574
04:00:11,777 --> 04:00:15,701
I know that we really don't have a lot of questions to ask because you won't have the answers to them.

1575
04:00:16,301 --> 04:00:21,706
But I guess I don't know why this has never even come to my head before, but I want to ask you a question.

1576
04:00:21,746 --> 04:00:25,049
When students come to the high school and they speak a different language,

1577
04:00:26,770 --> 04:00:41,179
I know that we have specific classes that we have to go into, but are they partnered with anybody in the high school themselves like to go to lunch with or anything like that that are here in our system as students and speak both languages?

1578
04:00:41,299 --> 04:00:49,664
And the reason I said that is I don't know why it's never really hit me, but many years ago going here, we had students that came in from Italy.

1579
04:00:49,684 --> 04:00:51,826
I remember my teacher actually asking me,

1580
04:00:52,566 --> 04:00:58,671
to see if that student could, well at that time our schedules were different, so that student had to come to all the classes I went to.

1581
04:00:59,332 --> 04:01:09,180
But at least to have someone that they could go to lunch with, introduce them to other people, that maybe, you know, speak the language that they're here, and in English.

1582
04:01:09,400 --> 04:01:11,522
And I don't, you know, I've never even asked that question.

1583
04:01:11,542 --> 04:01:12,083
I don't even know why.

1584
04:01:12,663 --> 04:01:27,195
Well, when the students come here who don't speak English, they're set up with special, with their classes that are with an ESL teacher or a duly certified teacher who is certified in the content as well as ESL.

1585
04:01:27,515 --> 04:01:30,398
And those are our newcomer classrooms even here at the high school.

1586
04:01:31,439 --> 04:01:36,563
The teachers in collaboration with the building, with the assistant principals and guidance

1587
04:01:36,923 --> 04:01:46,274
kind of have an informal protocol to set up students with other students, but it's not formalized, it's not a specific program.

1588
04:01:46,695 --> 04:01:52,422
But the actual classes, the students are with all newcomers in these newcomer classrooms.

1589
04:01:52,822 --> 04:01:53,923
No, I understood that.

1590
04:01:53,963 --> 04:02:07,354
I just didn't know if there was someone that they could hook them up with and, you know, at least show them, you know, to go to lunch with and maybe introduce them to their friends and, you know, that way at least interpret for them, especially when they come into a new building.

1591
04:02:08,115 --> 04:02:12,558
You know, you speak the language and you walk into a building or a new atmosphere and it's intimidating.

1592
04:02:13,038 --> 04:02:16,400
You know, to come in and not know the language is even worse.

1593
04:02:16,821 --> 04:02:23,445
So I was just thinking, like I said, years ago, my teachers just asked if we would take students along with us, at least at the beginning.

1594
04:02:24,565 --> 04:02:39,751
because it is very difficult to mandate someone to say, okay, you're going to be with that student every day, but at least to merge them into lunch, and where are the bathrooms, and where is the cafeteria, and how do you go talk to the principal, and how do I get back into that classroom that I was supposed to go into?

1595
04:02:40,071 --> 04:02:41,872
And like I said, that's done informally.

1596
04:02:41,892 --> 04:02:48,655
There's not a formal protocol or process for that, but the teachers work in collaboration with the guidance department on that.

1597
04:02:49,929 --> 04:02:50,509
Thank you very much.

1598
04:02:50,570 --> 04:02:50,730
Ms.

1599
04:02:50,750 --> 04:02:51,210
Van de Kloot.

1600
04:02:51,951 --> 04:02:58,475
So, Mr. Texerra, are we or are you thinking that we would pilot a program in Portuguese for next school year?

1601
04:02:59,476 --> 04:03:01,478
I would wait until guidance comes out.

1602
04:03:01,518 --> 04:03:13,106
I'm actually going to a state meeting this Friday that will give me some additional information and maybe I'll have a timeline on when the state will, you know, come out with their guidance.

1603
04:03:13,727 --> 04:03:17,690
But I wouldn't move forward with anything until the guidance came forth.

1604
04:03:18,030 --> 04:03:37,707
Okay, so um and at Medford High School say for the Portuguese students level one and level two would be those students who were certainly level one would be the students who were just coming to us and level two they might have been with us for Well those levels are based on what we do as a screener test when the students arrive.

1605
04:03:37,747 --> 04:03:38,767
It's based on um

1606
04:03:39,748 --> 04:03:45,730
WIDA testing, we're using the WIDA screener, and that gives us the level.

1607
04:03:46,130 --> 04:03:54,372
So students may have had English in their native country, which is why they would test as a level two, but they're still a newcomer, you know, just arrival.

1608
04:03:54,492 --> 04:03:59,333
Other students, you know, that are level one most likely didn't have English in their native country.

1609
04:04:00,570 --> 04:04:13,525
The other question, which certainly is to be addressed to you, but a little bit different, is that we changed significantly this year when we split some programs between the Roberts and the Brooks.

1610
04:04:14,166 --> 04:04:15,067
How is that working out?

1611
04:04:18,709 --> 04:04:22,591
I'd have to, I mean, are you looking for something specific?

1612
04:04:22,731 --> 04:04:31,674
Well, I was just curious, I think one of the concerns had to do with siblings and the ability of siblings to oversee their, you know, sisters and brothers.

1613
04:04:32,355 --> 04:04:42,279
I know that the Parent Information Center has been struggling with trying to do the placement that best meets both children, and in some cases that hasn't actually happened.

1614
04:04:43,004 --> 04:04:47,606
Okay, so at some point I'd like to ask for a report on how that's worked out.

1615
04:04:48,326 --> 04:04:51,647
It's going to be tied into our discussion about options.

1616
04:04:51,948 --> 04:04:53,168
Okay, sounds great.

1617
04:04:53,228 --> 04:05:00,371
It's a larger picture and, you know, Paul and I have had some serious discussions about the pros and cons of any kind of movement of people.

1618
04:05:00,871 --> 04:05:07,534
What it means for staff, what it means for transportation, what it means for siblings, what it means for, you know, language groupings.

1619
04:05:08,314 --> 04:05:12,879
This is a very complex issue, and it requires a great deal of trade-off.

1620
04:05:12,899 --> 04:05:22,249
You have to decide what's the most important thing to us, what are the most important issues to us, and how we're going to solve them, because there's no one perfect solution for any of this.

1621
04:05:23,130 --> 04:05:23,450
Thank you.

1622
04:05:24,091 --> 04:05:24,191
Ms.

1623
04:05:24,231 --> 04:05:27,735
Mastone, thank you for your report, both of you for your report.

1624
04:05:28,095 --> 04:05:38,478
The last paragraph on the report is, if we were to move either program to the Andrews, there are at least 10 teachers who will need the SEI endorsement.

1625
04:05:39,418 --> 04:05:44,839
Organizations such as MatSol, Revis, Steam, I don't know any of them, will do training in the district.

1626
04:05:44,879 --> 04:05:50,521
The cost is between $8,800 and $12,000 for anywhere from 25 to 30 participants.

1627
04:05:50,881 --> 04:05:51,641
So that's new to me.

1628
04:05:51,681 --> 04:05:53,741
I didn't know that there was a separate training.

1629
04:05:53,822 --> 04:05:55,422
And is it, how long is the training?

1630
04:05:56,584 --> 04:05:57,946
It's intense, it's a 40 hour course.

1631
04:05:59,813 --> 04:06:06,577
And so these companies will all come to our city and would train the teachers who need this certification?

1632
04:06:06,797 --> 04:06:07,017
Yes.

1633
04:06:07,737 --> 04:06:13,340
And it's only certain providers can give it because this was governed under the Department of Justice.

1634
04:06:14,741 --> 04:06:20,865
So like Medford can't just offer their own training and say, okay, you're retail endorsed.

1635
04:06:21,005 --> 04:06:26,328
It has to be through one of the state providers because the Department of Justice is still overseeing it.

1636
04:06:27,108 --> 04:06:27,509
Thank you.

1637
04:06:27,849 --> 04:06:34,257
At one time it should be noted that the courses were offered free, but that gate is now closed.

1638
04:06:34,758 --> 04:06:34,978
Okay.

1639
04:06:34,998 --> 04:06:42,968
So now we have to, if we have openings for new people, if they're not coming out of colleges with the SEL endorsement, we have to actually offer it if they have students.

1640
04:06:43,328 --> 04:06:43,769
Okay.

1641
04:06:43,929 --> 04:06:44,189
Thank you.

1642
04:06:45,757 --> 04:06:49,764
Is there a motion to receive and place this paper in place on file, ma'am?

1643
04:06:49,824 --> 04:06:52,990
I'm Mr. Scary, seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

1644
04:06:53,010 --> 04:06:54,172
All those in favor?

1645
04:06:55,033 --> 04:06:55,274
Aye.

1646
04:06:55,334 --> 04:06:55,694
Opposed?

1647
04:06:55,774 --> 04:06:56,436
Motion passes.

1648
04:06:56,456 --> 04:06:57,477
Thank you Mr. Texer.

1649
04:06:59,269 --> 04:07:04,233
Item five recommendation to approve Rick revised field trip policy, Mr Superintendent.

1650
04:07:04,293 --> 04:07:16,083
So we're going to ask our deputy superintendent to Bernadette Bernadette to director of curriculum to tell us how we responded to some of the issues that were raised recently.

1651
04:07:19,454 --> 04:07:19,914
Good evening.

1652
04:07:21,276 --> 04:07:32,224
So at the Committee of the Whole meeting on November 13th, Deputy Superintendent Beverly Nelson gave an overview of the draft of the field trip policy.

1653
04:07:33,946 --> 04:07:47,436
It is important to note, I want to give credit where credit is due, that the substantive part of this policy really was developed by Tony Vento, Director of Health Services, and Gail Trainor, Assistant Principal at the high school.

1654
04:07:48,737 --> 04:08:00,722
So Beverly, Tony, Gail, and I reviewed this in light of the comments that the committee had on the 13th and we made the following revisions.

1655
04:08:01,322 --> 04:08:04,344
There are five revisions that I will go over.

1656
04:08:04,864 --> 04:08:09,626
The first revision is that we added an accessibility statement.

1657
04:08:10,246 --> 04:08:18,173
So if you look on page one of the document, the bottom of page one, in bold print, we added the following.

1658
04:08:18,673 --> 04:08:24,898
The Metro Public Schools is committed to ensuring that district field trips are accessible to all students.

1659
04:08:25,579 --> 04:08:36,188
The policy adheres to all requirements set forth in both Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act, also known as ADA, of 1990.

1660
04:08:37,789 --> 04:08:40,290
So we addressed that concern with that statement.

1661
04:08:42,390 --> 04:08:50,132
The second concern that we addressed has to do with the definition of a chaperone.

1662
04:08:50,652 --> 04:08:57,414
And a chaperone includes any adult who is vested or non-vested with monitoring student safety.

1663
04:08:57,854 --> 04:08:59,915
So if you look on page two of your document,

1664
04:09:02,799 --> 04:09:06,580
The second half of the page, next to where it says chaperones, I will read that.

1665
04:09:07,161 --> 04:09:08,821
So the wording now is the following.

1666
04:09:09,402 --> 04:09:22,868
Chaperone is any employee of the Metro Public Schools or parent slash guardian or any adult that attends a trip and is vested or non-vested with the responsibility of monitoring student safety.

1667
04:09:24,113 --> 04:09:32,948
does not say a criminal offender record information or a quarry check of all chaperones must be on file in the superintendent's office at least seven days prior to the date of the trip.

1668
04:09:38,479 --> 04:09:48,468
The third concern has to do with in emergency situations, the school committee will be added to the list of entities that will be notified.

1669
04:09:48,849 --> 04:09:58,738
So if you look on page 3 of the document, under letter J, Roman numeral 3, lowercase Roman numeral 3,

1670
04:10:00,051 --> 04:10:02,633
you will see that members of the school committee have added.

1671
04:10:02,993 --> 04:10:22,985
So I'll read all of J. Should an emergency situation occur, the sponsoring faculty member is responsible for notifying to the best of their ability by telephone, text, or email as soon as possible, but no later than 24 hours after the emergency situation occurs, the following individuals.

1672
04:10:23,586 --> 04:10:26,308
The superintendent, headmaster, and principal.

1673
04:10:27,268 --> 04:10:32,752
the parent slash guardian of record, and again, number three, members of the school committee.

1674
04:10:34,293 --> 04:10:37,454
So we believe that addresses that third concern.

1675
04:10:38,895 --> 04:10:40,516
Going on to the fourth concern.

1676
04:10:42,097 --> 04:10:45,019
So the fourth concern has to do with the term counseling services.

1677
04:10:45,399 --> 04:10:47,901
We've broadened that to support services.

1678
04:10:48,321 --> 04:10:50,723
So if you look in the document on page five,

1679
04:10:52,702 --> 04:10:56,283
On page 5, you have section 4 approval documentation.

1680
04:10:56,403 --> 04:11:10,065
If you go down to letter D, again on page 5, letter D, it says the cost per student, if applicable, including the provision for nursing or support services.

1681
04:11:10,085 --> 04:11:15,286
So again, we change counseling to support services if necessary, as well as travel insurance.

1682
04:11:16,346 --> 04:11:18,687
So we believe that addresses that concern.

1683
04:11:19,947 --> 04:11:35,317
And then lastly, the fifth concern that was expressed on the night of the 13th has to do with affirming, creating an affirmation statement that all field trip related forms will be posted to the school's website.

1684
04:11:35,637 --> 04:11:47,024
So if you look on page nine of the document, it's the very last item, it's a letter D, and it now says all field trip related forms will be posted to the district website.

1685
04:11:48,770 --> 04:11:51,111
I am happy to take any questions.

1686
04:11:51,551 --> 04:11:51,691
Ms.

1687
04:11:51,731 --> 04:11:52,291
Van de Kloot.

1688
04:11:53,592 --> 04:11:54,432
Thank you, Bernadette.

1689
04:11:54,692 --> 04:12:01,815
So of the corrections and changes that you've made, I've noted that all the ones that I particularly had brought up, you've taken care of.

1690
04:12:02,335 --> 04:12:11,398
That, of course, now being said, is my eyes lit on another line here, which I think we need to amend.

1691
04:12:11,698 --> 04:12:13,359
So if you give me a second to find it.

1692
04:12:14,379 --> 04:12:20,741
Um, it has to do with the notification, um, for approval or disapproval of the field trip.

1693
04:12:20,881 --> 04:12:36,187
And it is on page four, uh, section three B. It reads right now, all school sponsored trips which involve overnight travel must receive prior approval of the superintendent and a vote by the Medford school committee six months prior to the trip.

1694
04:12:37,455 --> 04:12:39,996
And I have to say, I know that that's totally unrealistic.

1695
04:12:40,516 --> 04:12:48,398
I think that when we're thinking about it, we're thinking about all-schools concert trips, which involve overnight out-of-country travel.

1696
04:12:48,799 --> 04:12:58,762
So that would be when the kids are going off to Spain or Italy or whatever, that that time frame of six months is what we would be expecting or looking for.

1697
04:12:59,827 --> 04:13:09,496
But we all know that there have been other overnight trips, even including, you know, the SkillsUSA program is an overnight trip.

1698
04:13:10,176 --> 04:13:11,137
We've had kids go.

1699
04:13:11,157 --> 04:13:13,119
The Ethics Bowl was an overnight trip.

1700
04:13:13,599 --> 04:13:16,021
Those things, there was no time to give six months.

1701
04:13:16,442 --> 04:13:20,205
It's not realistic to have our policy say six months.

1702
04:13:20,725 --> 04:13:22,507
So I think we need a sentence which say,

1703
04:13:25,069 --> 04:13:37,097
for other field trips, you know, for other overnight trips, the school committee will be brought to the school committee for their approval.

1704
04:13:38,558 --> 04:13:39,239
Using discretion.

1705
04:13:40,079 --> 04:13:42,841
Using as timely, you know, I mean, it depends on the time frame.

1706
04:13:42,981 --> 04:13:45,783
I mean, prior discretion to the trip.

1707
04:13:46,063 --> 04:13:47,564
Yeah, prior to the trip.

1708
04:13:47,584 --> 04:13:49,125
But I mean, it has to be reasonable.

1709
04:13:49,145 --> 04:13:54,429
We really don't like the last minute ones that I mean, there's a last minute one because there's an opportunity that's last minute.

1710
04:13:55,109 --> 04:13:57,873
And there's a last minute one because nobody got around to telling us.

1711
04:13:57,893 --> 04:13:59,775
About prior payment for the trip.

1712
04:14:00,416 --> 04:14:01,197
So they have to.

1713
04:14:01,797 --> 04:14:04,861
That may be tough because sound payments are generally made well in advance.

1714
04:14:05,422 --> 04:14:07,965
Right, but you'd come before you do the deposit.

1715
04:14:10,097 --> 04:14:15,021
Before you sign the contract, the committee should approve it.

1716
04:14:15,542 --> 04:14:28,614
The only question I have about that is that sometimes, depending on our schedule, if something comes up quickly and a deposit has to be put in to hold it and we don't meet,

1717
04:14:30,051 --> 04:14:30,351
I'm sorry.

1718
04:14:30,371 --> 04:14:30,751
I didn't hear you.

1719
04:14:30,771 --> 04:14:31,872
I didn't hear you until after well deadline.

1720
04:14:31,972 --> 04:14:39,717
There is a clause which allows the superintendent to approve a trip if we don't have a meeting, Okay, so that's covered in that.

1721
04:14:40,177 --> 04:14:44,660
But again, I think the first sentence needs to say overnight out of country.

1722
04:14:45,280 --> 04:14:45,660
Okay um,

1723
04:14:51,985 --> 04:14:52,686
I'm just trying to think.

1724
04:14:53,467 --> 04:15:00,976
Other trips involving overnight travel must be must be approved by the school committee.

1725
04:15:01,977 --> 04:15:02,178
Um.

1726
04:15:03,559 --> 04:15:04,981
Within an appropriate time frame.

1727
04:15:05,161 --> 04:15:06,723
I think we're going to need to leave it a little bit.

1728
04:15:10,147 --> 04:15:12,389
unless someone else has a better wording.

1729
04:15:12,910 --> 04:15:24,020
The wording is already in here, it seems like, under E. I wouldn't distinguish between out of country or in.

1730
04:15:24,540 --> 04:15:28,784
Pride of payment means, well, they book it, they have to get approval from us.

1731
04:15:30,592 --> 04:15:38,959
And then if there's an extreme emergency, or it comes up really short notice, like the bulls came up very short notice, then that's different.

1732
04:15:39,459 --> 04:15:41,180
And that's addressed, like, outside of need.

1733
04:15:41,461 --> 04:15:44,303
So prior to payment.

1734
04:15:44,363 --> 04:15:45,464
Prior to payment.

1735
04:15:45,484 --> 04:15:46,885
Drop at six months.

1736
04:15:51,132 --> 04:15:52,735
Everyone acceptable with that?

1737
04:15:52,855 --> 04:16:01,471
So you're saying all school sponsored trips which involve overnight travel must receive prior approval of the superintendent and a vote of the Medford school committee prior to payment?

1738
04:16:01,551 --> 04:16:02,413
Prior to payment.

1739
04:16:02,873 --> 04:16:03,074
Okay.

1740
04:16:04,628 --> 04:16:05,209
I will add that.

1741
04:16:05,569 --> 04:16:06,030
Change that.

1742
04:16:06,810 --> 04:16:09,834
Are there any other suggestions at this point?

1743
04:16:10,194 --> 04:16:13,017
Nope, that's good.

1744
04:16:13,218 --> 04:16:13,918
Motion to approve.

1745
04:16:13,938 --> 04:16:14,679
Mr. Benedetto.

1746
04:16:14,719 --> 04:16:15,680
I just had one note too.

1747
04:16:16,121 --> 04:16:17,482
Mr. Benedetto.

1748
04:16:17,883 --> 04:16:21,547
First of all, thank you for making all the changes I brought forward at that meeting.

1749
04:16:24,594 --> 04:16:34,502
I'm just hoping that that statement about the method of public schools is committed to ensuring that the district field trips are accessible to all students.

1750
04:16:35,102 --> 04:16:47,412
The policy adheres to all requirements set forth by both Section 504 Rehabilitation Act and American Disability Act meets the needs that were brought up by other people at that meeting.

1751
04:16:48,713 --> 04:16:49,453
I think it does.

1752
04:16:49,613 --> 04:16:51,535
I think it's very appropriate.

1753
04:16:52,115 --> 04:16:54,696
So what I will say is that I did do research.

1754
04:16:54,896 --> 04:16:59,517
I looked at a lot of other district policy statements.

1755
04:16:59,877 --> 04:17:04,059
I looked at a lot of federal law.

1756
04:17:04,419 --> 04:17:09,220
And I thought this encompassed it in a broad way, in a succinct way.

1757
04:17:09,660 --> 04:17:12,241
There are volumes and volumes of information.

1758
04:17:12,261 --> 04:17:13,882
There's obviously lots of case law.

1759
04:17:14,482 --> 04:17:15,542
I try to be succinct.

1760
04:17:16,943 --> 04:17:19,043
I'm certainly willing to be open.

1761
04:17:21,764 --> 04:17:43,872
I did research And I just wanted to comment that I hope that Does meet that need and thank you for adding that in as well as making the changes I brought forward The only other thing I have is I was hoping to see an example of the form that teachers and staff would meet And I wanted to you know

1762
04:17:44,753 --> 04:17:56,743
make sure that it's on online so it goes from one person gets signed off by the nurses then goes to the administration and then finally signed off by the superintendent in electronic forum format.

1763
04:17:57,003 --> 04:17:59,826
So I would like to see and approve that form.

1764
04:18:00,286 --> 04:18:07,089
And also an example of the medication administration slash delegation form that the district uses.

1765
04:18:07,409 --> 04:18:08,750
I'd like to see that as well.

1766
04:18:08,810 --> 04:18:10,531
So it's here all in one shot.

1767
04:18:10,931 --> 04:18:17,854
So if parents ever want to see what's the policy, they have the sample forms, they have everything right here, part of this packet.

1768
04:18:18,394 --> 04:18:27,578
So I'm asking that this be revised and brought to us with those intact, because that was what was requested at our last meeting for my notes.

1769
04:18:28,098 --> 04:18:29,019
Can I ask a question?

1770
04:18:29,039 --> 04:18:32,081
So we do have forms.

1771
04:18:33,142 --> 04:18:34,884
There's probably 12, maybe.

1772
04:18:34,904 --> 04:18:36,245
I think there are about 12 forms.

1773
04:18:36,625 --> 04:18:38,587
They are still in development.

1774
04:18:38,707 --> 04:18:42,110
I know that, again, Tony Vento and Gail Traynor have been working on them.

1775
04:18:42,450 --> 04:18:44,331
They're very close to being finalized.

1776
04:18:44,612 --> 04:18:46,033
But it's not just one or two.

1777
04:18:46,333 --> 04:18:54,640
There are a lot of forms, and we're trying to make them so that they're visually easy to understand, yet substantive at the same time.

1778
04:18:55,020 --> 04:18:58,104
So I'm asking to table this until we have completed.

1779
04:18:58,144 --> 04:18:59,766
Well, we've asked for an amendment as well.

1780
04:18:59,926 --> 04:19:01,288
So when you bring back the amendment.

1781
04:19:02,649 --> 04:19:03,330
May I ask one question?

1782
04:19:03,350 --> 04:19:04,451
Do you have the samples ready?

1783
04:19:04,832 --> 04:19:10,118
Is there any concern about tabling this piece of it at this point?

1784
04:19:10,178 --> 04:19:12,221
Is it going to hold anything up in terms of?

1785
04:19:13,322 --> 04:19:14,103
We have an amendment.

1786
04:19:14,263 --> 04:19:14,444
Yeah.

1787
04:19:16,179 --> 04:19:17,440
I don't think it's going to hold anything up.

1788
04:19:17,480 --> 04:19:20,002
You know the basic premise of the report.

1789
04:19:20,022 --> 04:19:20,663
Right, okay.

1790
04:19:20,703 --> 04:19:25,666
I think if we allow us to just move forward, you know, and the formalization will take place when we get back.

1791
04:19:25,686 --> 04:19:25,766
Okay.

1792
04:19:25,786 --> 04:19:30,169
Do you want a motion to approve subject to the amendment that we just drafted?

1793
04:19:31,010 --> 04:19:33,312
Well, Erin, yes.

1794
04:19:33,632 --> 04:19:34,072
I'd second.

1795
04:19:34,112 --> 04:19:42,318
No, Erin wants to, what I was just asking was for clarification because Erin wants to table it at right now and hold it until we have all of it together.

1796
04:19:42,338 --> 04:19:44,720
I just asked whether there was any problem with that.

1797
04:19:45,040 --> 04:19:49,983
Well, I guess, you know, we're going to have some field trips that are going to show up, you know, in the next little while.

1798
04:19:50,003 --> 04:19:54,866
And if it takes a little bit longer to get everything clear, we'll be operating under some old rules.

1799
04:19:54,926 --> 04:19:59,689
It might be useful to just simply say that in the main, this is an acceptable piece, understanding the amendment.

1800
04:20:00,649 --> 04:20:04,812
I mean, and that we provide the forms of the earliest possible time in January.

1801
04:20:06,929 --> 04:20:16,596
Mayor, I would second the field trip policy we accepted tonight with inclusion of amendments at an earlier, at the latest date.

1802
04:20:17,536 --> 04:20:17,936
Forms?

1803
04:20:18,257 --> 04:20:18,817
Forms, yes.

1804
04:20:20,078 --> 04:20:22,620
And we'll provide them to you, but at least you'll have something that's, you know.

1805
04:20:22,660 --> 04:20:24,061
At least we have a policy in place.

1806
04:20:25,192 --> 04:20:26,733
The forms need to be approved.

1807
04:20:26,793 --> 04:20:49,403
I want them district-wide this specific thing So it's hard to approve something based on without having everything at one point I do like everything is in here that we need in here, but I How long would it take to get the forms to us and be presented we have a lot of meetings coming up I mean They have to be k-12

1808
04:20:50,985 --> 04:20:53,186
I don't know if there's anything else you would like to add to that.

1809
04:20:53,307 --> 04:20:54,387
They are created.

1810
04:20:54,607 --> 04:20:56,608
I think they might need a little bit more tweaking.

1811
04:20:56,749 --> 04:20:58,029
We have been working on that.

1812
04:20:58,149 --> 04:21:01,031
Perhaps Beverly has something to add to that.

1813
04:21:01,812 --> 04:21:03,012
The forms were done.

1814
04:21:03,092 --> 04:21:04,313
They just aren't organized.

1815
04:21:04,373 --> 04:21:10,016
When we got the forms, they were so voluminous that they were just very hard for people to deal with.

1816
04:21:10,417 --> 04:21:12,298
So I know Tony, we've been working at it.

1817
04:21:12,358 --> 04:21:15,259
We just, it will take more time to get it.

1818
04:21:18,868 --> 04:21:25,675
And again, I'm a little concerned about dragging this out because people are looking for guidance, the administration, the principals.

1819
04:21:25,695 --> 04:21:27,477
We have a meeting tomorrow with principals.

1820
04:21:27,517 --> 04:21:32,102
We'd like to be able to say we have a policy guide so that we don't keep going on.

1821
04:21:32,783 --> 04:21:35,566
The forms, again, it's an organizational piece.

1822
04:21:35,847 --> 04:21:36,768
It's trying to

1823
04:21:37,515 --> 04:21:42,599
make them customer friendly, and it should not really be anything.

1824
04:21:42,739 --> 04:21:43,720
Point of information.

1825
04:21:43,860 --> 04:21:47,383
Mr. Skerry, point of information.

1826
04:21:47,403 --> 04:21:47,443
Ms.

1827
04:21:47,603 --> 04:21:51,206
Nelson, can we have those forms by the 18th to satisfy the needs of this board?

1828
04:21:52,447 --> 04:21:53,087
I think so.

1829
04:21:53,147 --> 04:21:58,792
Tony, you said we've been revising, we've been working on it, we just don't have it perfect.

1830
04:21:59,773 --> 04:22:00,113
Okay.

1831
04:22:00,493 --> 04:22:03,556
In terms of, there are medical forms, okay, it's kind of,

1832
04:22:04,542 --> 04:22:05,603
a cascading effect.

1833
04:22:05,623 --> 04:22:13,908
There's the preliminary forms that everybody's going to have to do, and then what comes into play is another set of forms for children that have medical issues.

1834
04:22:14,669 --> 04:22:21,033
So we need to make it so that people understand they don't have to fill out 20 forms when it doesn't apply.

1835
04:22:21,513 --> 04:22:28,598
And so that's what we're struggling with now, trying to make this concise, make it applicable to the particular trip.

1836
04:22:29,279 --> 04:22:32,741
And we don't want, because we know what happens when you put a whole bunch of papers out,

1837
04:22:33,206 --> 04:22:34,887
People just look at it and say, I can't do this.

1838
04:22:35,127 --> 04:22:35,827
It's just too much.

1839
04:22:36,187 --> 04:22:38,168
So we're trying to make it customer friendly.

1840
04:22:38,708 --> 04:22:47,131
But again, the policy, the form should really not, I mean, we can get them to you, but I'd like to move forward with this if we could.

1841
04:22:47,151 --> 04:22:49,072
Mr. Benedetto, follow up on this?

1842
04:22:49,212 --> 04:22:50,532
Yes, please.

1843
04:22:50,832 --> 04:22:55,654
So the form I'm looking at is the application to go on the field trip.

1844
04:22:55,914 --> 04:23:01,236
Not so much all the forms that all parents have to do, but even the application form.

1845
04:23:01,736 --> 04:23:10,963
Okay, I want to take my second grade class to apple picking at, you know, small farms.

1846
04:23:11,543 --> 04:23:22,352
And so I'm going to go online, I'm going to fill this out, it's going to go to the nurse, and it's going to go to my head, you know, my principal and the superintendent for approval.

1847
04:23:23,416 --> 04:23:24,677
That's the type of form I want.

1848
04:23:24,697 --> 04:23:25,397
From the teacher.

1849
04:23:25,677 --> 04:23:26,398
From everyone.

1850
04:23:26,458 --> 04:23:31,941
And I want it tracked, so I want to know, I want data next year saying, this is where they went.

1851
04:23:32,941 --> 04:23:38,344
This grade over here went on five field trips, whereas this school over here hasn't.

1852
04:23:38,424 --> 04:23:41,486
And maybe as a district, we might want to help them.

1853
04:23:42,126 --> 04:23:44,507
or, you know, I want that data.

1854
04:23:44,527 --> 04:23:53,148
So that's the form that I, I don't need every single form at this point, but I want, when you roll this out, okay, here's our new thing, and this is how you apply.

1855
04:23:53,668 --> 04:23:54,809
I want it to go with it.

1856
04:23:55,309 --> 04:23:55,929
If you just do that one.

1857
04:23:55,949 --> 04:23:57,229
So the form that starts the process.

1858
04:23:57,889 --> 04:24:05,871
And I think, too, Erin, you may have mentioned last time at the meeting a checklist of things that, the checklist, I think we added one thing to the checklist.

1859
04:24:05,911 --> 04:24:11,072
So we have the checklist, we have the preliminary form, it's just that we really want to make

1860
04:24:11,584 --> 04:24:21,828
everything else, and it can be a lot of forms, depending upon the youngsters who are going on the trip, something that people aren't going to look at and say, I'm not going to go on the trip because I don't want to fill out the forms.

1861
04:24:22,288 --> 04:24:24,769
That would be the last thing we want to do on that.

1862
04:24:25,150 --> 04:24:31,052
We can do the checklist, and we can do just the preliminary application.

1863
04:24:31,718 --> 04:24:53,608
clarification on motion point of information yeah um there is i mean i know there's a large group of that have computers but there's also a large group out there that doesn't and so i just want to make sure i'm you know not everything translates from on-site to actually had copy as easily

1864
04:24:54,688 --> 04:24:58,853
So when we're doing this online, are we doing them in different languages?

1865
04:24:59,214 --> 04:25:03,099
This is just for teachers to fill out an application to take the class.

1866
04:25:03,199 --> 04:25:04,701
OK, that's where the clarification is.

1867
04:25:04,881 --> 04:25:07,064
You're not talking about the parent filling it out.

1868
04:25:07,124 --> 04:25:10,488
You're actually just talking about the teacher filling it out.

1869
04:25:10,508 --> 04:25:11,049
That's a process.

1870
04:25:11,129 --> 04:25:14,870
There will be a parent permission form that will be part of the package.

1871
04:25:15,270 --> 04:25:19,952
But I think at this point we're talking about what's the checklist.

1872
04:25:20,692 --> 04:25:31,575
A lot of this has stemmed from the fact that teachers would begin to plan trips, begin to fundraise, begin to get kids excited without the principal knowing.

1873
04:25:31,835 --> 04:25:34,716
And then there were all kinds of repercussions after the fact.

1874
04:25:34,736 --> 04:25:37,757
So this was really initially an attempt to make sure that

1875
04:25:38,598 --> 04:25:41,739
before people start the process, they know what the process has to be.

1876
04:25:42,259 --> 04:25:44,700
And so that was where this was originated from.

1877
04:25:44,720 --> 04:25:46,941
Could you repeat the motion?

1878
04:25:48,522 --> 04:25:49,602
There's two separate ones.

1879
04:25:49,662 --> 04:25:55,165
One's a motion to accept the policy with the one amendment that was made a little earlier.

1880
04:25:55,685 --> 04:26:00,167
And then Erin asked that the whole policy not be accepted until we have the forms.

1881
04:26:00,847 --> 04:26:03,608
She's now specified it's the start form.

1882
04:26:04,188 --> 04:26:05,709
But to me, the policy

1883
04:26:06,755 --> 04:26:12,039
dictates and the forms can come and they can be changed as things change in life.

1884
04:26:12,680 --> 04:26:22,048
So I would ask that we approve the policy so that we can get it out to the principals, especially at your meeting tomorrow, and then we can get the forms at our next meeting.

1885
04:26:23,249 --> 04:26:28,894
We can get those two forms to you next time, but we won't have the opportunity to meet with the principals again until January.

1886
04:26:29,354 --> 04:26:31,376
So if we had this to them tomorrow, it would be helpful.

1887
04:26:32,130 --> 04:26:32,270
Ms.

1888
04:26:32,310 --> 04:26:32,570
Kretz.

1889
04:26:34,411 --> 04:26:36,692
I had a similar question about the forms.

1890
04:26:36,732 --> 04:26:47,575
I just wanted to know, are the forms going to be available to the teachers with the Google Doc documents where they can go in and add their information and move it along?

1891
04:26:47,895 --> 04:26:49,756
Because I think that was discussed at the last meeting.

1892
04:26:50,997 --> 04:26:58,244
At the committee of the whole about the field trip, there was a number of parents from the CPAC organization.

1893
04:26:58,745 --> 04:27:06,793
Did you reach out to them to ask them if this was, I don't, they spoke about the language they were looking for that made them feel confident that we were being equitable.

1894
04:27:07,374 --> 04:27:08,395
So is that possible?

1895
04:27:08,415 --> 04:27:12,579
I think the chairperson said, could you reach out to me with language, I could help you with language.

1896
04:27:13,380 --> 04:27:25,916
Right, we basically, as Bernadette said, she did the research, but we also worked with Kathy Medaglia, who looked at this for me and thought that this would be something that would cover all of those instances, so we feel that it does.

1897
04:27:27,688 --> 04:27:28,589
There's a motion on the floor.

1898
04:27:28,629 --> 04:27:28,789
Ms.

1899
04:27:28,809 --> 04:27:29,249
Vander Kloot.

1900
04:27:29,510 --> 04:27:35,075
So you're going to kill me, but I'm going back to this line about approval.

1901
04:27:35,855 --> 04:27:37,337
And you just said something.

1902
04:27:37,357 --> 04:27:48,226
You said that what happened in the past is that teachers started, you know, advertising to the kids that they were going to go on this and they got everybody all excited and they might even start raising money.

1903
04:27:49,067 --> 04:27:51,469
And that has nothing to do with payment.

1904
04:27:52,648 --> 04:28:06,294
So if we're saying that when we want to approve the trip, if you're waiting, saying, well, we only need to approve it with payment, that means that teacher can already be advertising it and they can be raising money.

1905
04:28:06,534 --> 04:28:09,716
Payment is not the word that you want there.

1906
04:28:09,956 --> 04:28:11,896
So we're dealing with which, come on back.

1907
04:28:12,157 --> 04:28:15,818
So this is page four, number three.

1908
04:28:19,480 --> 04:28:21,941
So it's, yes, right here.

1909
04:28:23,081 --> 04:28:30,115
All school-sponsored trips involve overnight, out-of-state travel must receive prior approval to protect.

1910
04:28:30,135 --> 04:28:32,680
They need to figure out if people are even interested in going.

1911
04:28:34,599 --> 04:28:36,180
They have to pull their students.

1912
04:28:36,281 --> 04:28:39,143
If no one wants to go, they're not going to come to us and ask for approval.

1913
04:28:39,163 --> 04:28:42,166
I'm not sure what they are.

1914
04:28:42,186 --> 04:28:42,526
Right?

1915
04:28:42,606 --> 04:28:49,532
So what you're saying is that it should not be prior to payment, that we need to take that out.

1916
04:28:49,813 --> 04:28:53,236
Moments ago, you suggested that we add that in prior to payment.

1917
04:28:53,316 --> 04:28:54,177
I didn't suggest payment.

1918
04:28:54,197 --> 04:28:54,737
Someone else did.

1919
04:28:54,757 --> 04:28:54,857
I did.

1920
04:28:55,418 --> 04:28:55,698
OK?

1921
04:28:55,758 --> 04:28:59,922
And I suggested that what we were doing was saying that the teacher was going

1922
04:29:01,343 --> 04:29:06,733
I think if there's an overnight trip, um, uh, to the school district, I think it's a good idea to have an overnight trip.

1923
04:29:09,961 --> 04:29:16,087
within the United States that we want two months notice, maybe three months notice.

1924
04:29:16,107 --> 04:29:31,961
Okay, I'm saying, and then I'm putting in a clause and saying if an opportunity arises for students that is, you know, underneath this timeframe, that approval can be given by the superintendent with notification to the school committee.

1925
04:29:33,234 --> 04:29:35,194
I mean, that's how I would line it out.

1926
04:29:35,254 --> 04:29:38,775
Now, because payment, I think is, I think payment is arbitrary.

1927
04:29:38,915 --> 04:29:41,056
And there are some trips that we're not going to require payment.

1928
04:29:41,136 --> 04:29:42,556
Some of the out of overnight trips.

1929
04:29:42,576 --> 04:29:42,676
Right.

1930
04:29:42,696 --> 04:29:48,578
So just recently, the Italian come with this opportunity to go to New York.

1931
04:29:48,618 --> 04:29:48,858
Right.

1932
04:29:49,118 --> 04:29:51,158
Well, that was being funded by someone else.

1933
04:29:51,178 --> 04:29:51,338
Right.

1934
04:29:51,518 --> 04:29:52,079
Exactly.

1935
04:29:52,199 --> 04:29:58,860
So maybe in a timely way, overnight trips, other overnight trips must be approved in a timely way.

1936
04:29:58,880 --> 04:30:02,361
Because we do have things that happen very quickly, like that New York trip.

1937
04:30:03,098 --> 04:30:05,005
others we have several months doing.

1938
04:30:05,045 --> 04:30:08,598
So if we just put it in a timely way and we leave it kind of discretionary.

1939
04:30:10,543 --> 04:30:16,625
I think you need to be careful not to overregulate, because what happens is that circumstances change, situations change.

1940
04:30:17,146 --> 04:30:27,470
What you're really saying to us, be responsible, be reasonable, keep us informed, make things, you know, don't let people go run amok and go too far down the road before, you know, you know about it.

1941
04:30:27,490 --> 04:30:29,671
Because that's really what we're basically saying to people.

1942
04:30:29,711 --> 04:30:35,313
And I think, you know, we've got professionals on staff, they've got to understand that that means give us the information in a timely way.

1943
04:30:36,013 --> 04:30:41,797
Mr. Superintendent, do I dare remind you that just last week we were approving a field trip.

1944
04:30:41,817 --> 04:30:44,059
We had a new administrator.

1945
04:30:44,859 --> 04:30:47,682
We also had a full month where we didn't hold a meeting.

1946
04:30:48,302 --> 04:30:52,165
And that's really, you know, that was really a circumstantial thing, but that's a typical.

1947
04:30:52,905 --> 04:30:54,226
Let me just ask the committee.

1948
04:30:54,586 --> 04:31:03,813
If we're talking about foreign trips out of the country to Italy, to Honduras, wherever it is, how much time does the committee want to know in advance to approve that?

1949
04:31:03,833 --> 04:31:04,674
90 days.

1950
04:31:06,434 --> 04:31:06,795
90 days.

1951
04:31:07,115 --> 04:31:08,156
Here it said six months.

1952
04:31:09,178 --> 04:31:11,260
We usually bring those to you pretty early.

1953
04:31:11,280 --> 04:31:16,226
I just don't want to be in a situation where there might be an opportunity for our students to do something.

1954
04:31:24,036 --> 04:31:33,798
And then because the teacher then looks down and looks at the policy and says, oh, geez, it wasn't within the two weeks or it wasn't within the three weeks or seven months.

1955
04:31:33,938 --> 04:31:35,138
What if they don't even bring it?

1956
04:31:35,638 --> 04:31:40,199
What if we kept it six months unless there are extenuating circumstances?

1957
04:31:40,359 --> 04:31:41,119
That's fine.

1958
04:31:41,340 --> 04:31:42,440
That's fine.

1959
04:31:42,480 --> 04:31:44,940
Discretionary.

1960
04:31:45,460 --> 04:31:48,421
Six months unless there are extenuating circumstances.

1961
04:31:49,764 --> 04:31:51,265
That leaves some flexibility.

1962
04:31:51,345 --> 04:31:58,750
Okay, so I think you should do three months because I think Wait, the six months was for foreign travel, right?

1963
04:31:58,830 --> 04:32:07,096
Okay, if you're saying just a general blanket, then and the kids are going to Cape Cod, we're not asking for six months time.

1964
04:32:07,796 --> 04:32:15,742
No, the regular overnight in domestic trips, I thought we said would be in a timely way because those are going to

1965
04:32:16,457 --> 04:32:17,177
I think it's reasonable.

1966
04:32:17,217 --> 04:32:19,678
I think it's reasonable for them to pop up quickly or they may be longer.

1967
04:32:19,698 --> 04:32:20,958
I think those have been a timely way.

1968
04:32:21,318 --> 04:32:25,879
The six months, um, is the international I think is reasonable.

1969
04:32:26,019 --> 04:32:26,399
Most people.

1970
04:32:26,619 --> 04:32:29,459
Most of those trips are planned a year in advance for the most part.

1971
04:32:29,740 --> 04:32:30,300
All right.

1972
04:32:30,420 --> 04:32:31,380
That's good.

1973
04:32:31,420 --> 04:32:37,841
So as amended now motion for approval of the policy as amended on the floor seconded by Mr

1974
04:32:43,137 --> 04:32:43,577
Thank you.

1975
04:32:43,617 --> 04:32:44,037
Thank you.

1976
04:32:44,077 --> 04:32:44,317
Thank you.

1977
04:32:44,337 --> 04:32:44,678
Thank you.

1978
04:32:45,538 --> 04:32:46,938
Thank you.

1979
04:32:46,958 --> 04:32:47,158
Thank you.

1980
04:32:47,238 --> 04:32:47,719
Thank you.

1981
04:32:47,759 --> 04:32:48,039
Thank you.

1982
04:32:48,059 --> 04:32:48,399
Thank you.

1983
04:32:48,439 --> 04:32:49,039
Thank you.

1984
04:32:49,099 --> 04:32:49,399
Thank you.

1985
04:32:49,439 --> 04:32:50,600
Thank you.

1986
04:32:50,720 --> 04:32:51,020
Thank you.

1987
04:32:51,100 --> 04:32:51,720
Thank you.

1988
04:32:51,820 --> 04:32:52,180
Thank you.

1989
04:32:52,240 --> 04:32:52,480
Thank you.

1990
04:32:52,500 --> 04:32:52,960
Thank you.

1991
04:32:52,980 --> 04:32:53,381
Thank you.

1992
04:32:53,441 --> 04:32:53,961
Thank you.

1993
04:32:54,001 --> 04:32:54,301
Thank you.

1994
04:32:54,321 --> 04:32:54,701
Thank you.

1995
04:32:54,721 --> 04:32:54,941
Thank you.

1996
04:32:54,961 --> 04:32:55,301
Thank you.

1997
04:33:07,304 --> 04:33:12,648
Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee extend condolences to the family of Sandra Toomey who passed away Tuesday.

1998
04:33:12,748 --> 04:33:17,291
Mrs. Toomey was a dedicated community activist and active in Medford public education.

1999
04:33:17,391 --> 04:33:21,434
She is survived by husband Bill and son Thomas and daughter-in-law Kathleen.

2000
04:33:22,315 --> 04:33:28,959
Also be it further resolved that the Medford School Committee send condolences to the family of Margaret Regan, a longtime teacher at the Swan School.

2001
04:33:29,600 --> 04:33:32,442
If we could all rise for a moment of silence please on the passing of these two.

2002
04:33:34,654 --> 04:33:37,796
Citizens.

2003
04:33:44,181 --> 04:33:44,501
Thank you.

2004
04:33:48,877 --> 04:33:50,737
Does the motion that this meeting be adjourned?

2005
04:33:51,078 --> 04:33:54,998
I have one very quick announcement.

2006
04:33:55,098 --> 04:33:57,939
I just want to make one quick announcement.

2007
04:33:58,919 --> 04:34:04,281
There are several Medford High School students who created a new educational series.

2008
04:34:04,861 --> 04:34:09,942
The name of the series is The Chronicles of Modern Military History.

2009
04:34:11,442 --> 04:34:17,244
The shows are being created right here at the Medford Community Media Station.

2010
04:34:19,085 --> 04:34:27,773
And the replay of the first episode will be taking place this Wednesday at 7 p.m.

2011
04:34:27,793 --> 04:34:31,317
and Saturday, December 9th at 7 p.m.

2012
04:34:33,084 --> 04:34:37,506
on Channel 47 Verizon and Channel 3 Comcast.

2013
04:34:38,287 --> 04:34:42,269
Next week on December 14th will be episode number two.

2014
04:34:44,190 --> 04:34:59,317
All of the students that are involved in this program are writing, editing, they're doing the music, the narrating, and they're coming in after school hours and just working on this on their own.

2015
04:35:00,998 --> 04:35:02,960
It's been a wonderful episode.

2016
04:35:02,980 --> 04:35:04,461
We've been sharing it on Facebook.

2017
04:35:04,922 --> 04:35:17,612
I'm gonna get a message over to Lisa Evangelista to ask her to share the link on the blog if anybody gets a chance to tune in and it's just a great new show that's been created by

2018
04:35:18,493 --> 04:35:23,176
several students, a combination of high school and vocational students.

2019
04:35:23,857 --> 04:35:26,099
I just wanted to give a couple of mentions.

2020
04:35:26,699 --> 04:35:40,371
There's been Flood, Matt Adaletto, Justin Garland, Angel Barozo, Ian Agudo, Gavin Bibbins, and Trip Hill, and narrated by Noah Kretz.

2021
04:35:41,091 --> 04:35:47,217
So if everybody gets a chance, if they want to tune into the station, it's just a great educational episode.

2022
04:35:47,797 --> 04:35:48,539
Thank you very much.

2023
04:35:48,559 --> 04:35:48,959
Motion to adjourn.

2024
04:35:48,979 --> 04:35:49,280
Thank you.

2025
04:37:01,872 --> 04:37:02,513
fraternity.

2026
04:37:03,314 --> 04:37:12,003
Skull and Bones counts among its members three former presidents, members of the CIA, and some of the richest men in the country.

2027
04:37:12,964 --> 04:37:20,172
In fact, one of Ron's classmates, a certain George W. Bush, had just been invited to join.

2028
04:44:51,037 --> 04:44:51,838
I was crying.

2029
04:44:51,858 --> 04:44:53,400
I was blaming myself.

2030
04:44:53,420 --> 04:44:54,882
I hated myself very much.

2031
04:44:54,902 --> 04:44:58,487
I was worried that I couldn't get children.

2032
04:44:58,507 --> 04:45:02,372
I was worried that no one was going to love me.

2033
04:45:03,482 --> 04:45:11,968
But then he was approached by Ulwaluko, an organisation that supports young amputees like Becky, many of whom have lost their entire penises.

2034
04:45:12,969 --> 04:45:15,931
Patrick D'Acqua, their spokesman, is one of the lucky ones.

2035
04:45:16,732 --> 04:45:22,316
After his initiation, a friend got him to hospital in time to prevent any serious damage to his penis.

2036
04:45:23,417 --> 04:45:29,505
In 2016 alone, around 40 young men died after their circumcisions became infected.

2037
04:45:30,206 --> 04:45:34,211
Most of these boys, they lost their penis because of gangrene.

2038
04:45:34,572 --> 04:45:37,976
Gangrene is caused by too tight of bandaging.

2039
04:45:38,597 --> 04:45:41,361
They lost their penis because of septicemia.

2040
04:45:42,751 --> 04:45:47,413
The trouble is, there are no longer any experienced elders involved in the ceremony.

2041
04:45:48,233 --> 04:45:55,216
Today, initiations are carried out by the young, for the young, and no one has any idea what they're doing.

2042
04:45:56,416 --> 04:46:05,020
Despite the harm caused, Patrick still sees the value in the initiations themselves, helping to bring unruly young men into line.

2043
04:46:05,600 --> 04:46:09,322
It was meant for when someone is causing a havoc in the community.

2044
04:53:39,242 --> 04:53:49,941
suspicious to me people weren't just winning a few times i mean the same individuals kept winning prizes again and again and again and again

2045
04:53:54,785 --> 04:53:59,127
One person claimed 252 winning tickets.

2046
04:53:59,728 --> 04:54:04,030
I mean, what are the chances of people winning the lottery on such a regular basis?

2047
04:54:04,430 --> 04:54:05,290
I came from Las Vegas.

2048
04:54:05,310 --> 04:54:05,931
That's where I grew up.

2049
04:54:06,451 --> 04:54:14,015
And I thought, personally, being from Vegas, if this was a casino, they would be taking you into a back room and figuring out how you're winning so often.

2050
04:54:14,551 --> 04:54:20,093
Lawrence managed to track down some of these winners and asked them how had they won so often.

2051
04:54:20,113 --> 04:54:23,794
And of course their responses were nonsensical.

2052
04:54:23,814 --> 04:54:27,476
You know one person told me he dreamed in numbers.

2053
04:54:27,996 --> 04:54:30,057
But being suspicious wasn't enough.

2054
04:54:30,577 --> 04:54:38,400
The big question really was okay I know that these people are winning a lot but theoretically you could win as much as you want.
