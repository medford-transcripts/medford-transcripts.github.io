    "_COMMENT": "This video includes spurious footage before and after the meeting, which has been removed from the transcript. The actual meeting runs from 02:06:25 - 04:36:02, but there is some informal chatter captured from 01:58:21 until the start of the meeting, which I kept. Gaps in speaker IDs are from this removed footage."
