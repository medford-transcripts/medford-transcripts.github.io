1
00:00:00,131 --> 00:00:05,944
welcome to the May 2024 meeting for the Commission of Persons with Disabilities.

2
00:00:06,526 --> 00:00:10,134
I'm Frances Magé, Director of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.

3
00:00:16,549 --> 00:00:17,309
Thanks for this.

4
00:00:17,389 --> 00:00:19,051
Yeah, we can do brief introductions.

5
00:00:19,511 --> 00:00:20,372
My name is Gabby.

6
00:00:21,432 --> 00:00:26,176
I've been on the commission for, I think, I don't know, a few years now.

7
00:00:28,137 --> 00:00:31,220
And yeah, I will pass it off to Linda.

8
00:00:32,761 --> 00:00:33,562
I'm Linda Braden.

9
00:00:33,622 --> 00:00:37,304
I've been on the commission for about three years, I think now.

10
00:00:37,745 --> 00:00:43,109
I've been a resident in Medford for almost 10 years, I want to say.

11
00:00:44,421 --> 00:00:47,844
And my specialty is digital accessibility.

12
00:00:48,104 --> 00:00:50,646
And I will popcorn it over to Cam.

13
00:00:53,448 --> 00:00:58,812
Cam, five months into my commissionhood, and I'm going to pass it to Joe.

14
00:00:58,832 --> 00:01:05,257
Hi, Joe Casey, lifelong resident of MedFed and happy to be here.

15
00:01:05,277 --> 00:01:10,261
I'm sorry, who's next?

16
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,300
I'm next.

17
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:22,326
That's Tom, and I've been on the commission for the fourth year, almost five years, and president of Medford for 17 years.

18
00:01:22,346 --> 00:01:27,248
That's it.

19
00:01:28,669 --> 00:01:28,969
Thanks.

20
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:34,472
So I guess the first order of business is to review the April minutes.

21
00:01:35,675 --> 00:01:38,578
And I did notice that I put the wrong year in the heading.

22
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:40,840
It says 2023.

23
00:01:42,361 --> 00:01:47,766
But if everybody either had a chance to take a look at those or wants to take a minute to take a look.

24
00:01:52,389 --> 00:01:59,035
I can make that edit for you now, Gabby, and send it out to everyone so that we can get it stamped tonight.

25
00:01:59,976 --> 00:02:00,276
Perfect.

26
00:02:00,436 --> 00:02:01,077
Thank you so much.

27
00:02:09,981 --> 00:02:12,942
Would anybody like to make a motion to approve?

28
00:02:14,022 --> 00:02:20,983
I've read them, and I'll make a motion to approve the minutes with the correction of the year.

29
00:02:21,784 --> 00:02:23,464
With the correction of the year.

30
00:02:23,484 --> 00:02:25,564
And Joe, does it look like you're second?

31
00:02:25,584 --> 00:02:25,864
Second.

32
00:02:26,425 --> 00:02:31,866
Yep, you got it.

33
00:02:35,506 --> 00:02:36,607
And any abstentions?

34
00:02:36,707 --> 00:02:37,007
Anybody?

35
00:02:43,509 --> 00:02:45,910
The next thing would be the secretary position.

36
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:50,793
I assume that I think it's the same members that were here last time.

37
00:02:50,953 --> 00:02:57,496
So I think we're probably in the same spot unless anybody is itching to volunteer.

38
00:02:57,516 --> 00:03:00,797
I'm taking notes right now and I'm happy to do it for this month.

39
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:06,760
We can just keep it on the calendar.

40
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:10,121
Maybe for that, we can start to popcorn it starting the next meeting.

41
00:03:11,142 --> 00:03:11,882
I think it makes sense.

42
00:03:16,003 --> 00:03:24,547
Great, so I think the next thing is the Disability Fair logistics.

43
00:03:24,887 --> 00:03:27,648
Kim, I saw that you sent an email out about the date.

44
00:03:28,789 --> 00:03:34,071
So we're just shooting for the fall at the McGlynn, and that's kind of where we're at right now.

45
00:03:35,868 --> 00:03:45,415
So, I previously emailed Robert Robert can help us book the gym and said, Kevin could help us with anything outside of the.

46
00:03:46,496 --> 00:03:51,220
School Kevin responded and is saying.

47
00:03:52,673 --> 00:03:56,395
we should book McGlynn Playground through the school department.

48
00:03:56,455 --> 00:03:59,197
So maybe it's back on Robert.

49
00:04:00,278 --> 00:04:10,964
And then we got some helpful guidance from Kevin on the other meeting, the other events that are happening in September.

50
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:12,585
I put them in the chat.

51
00:04:14,126 --> 00:04:18,569
Kevin advises that we avoid the weekend of the 21st, 27th, 28th.

52
00:04:22,292 --> 00:04:35,913
So, you know, I think we should maybe still be a little bit open and flexible, but I'll continue to work on getting this booked with Bobby.

53
00:04:39,251 --> 00:04:46,837
I just want to throw in that there are other dates as well that you have to be aware of in October.

54
00:04:47,398 --> 00:04:53,843
Medford Health Matters has a youth event planned and it's already booked at the McGlynn that long weekend in October.

55
00:04:54,443 --> 00:05:01,169
And there is something else that I believe is happening the weekend of September 14th through veteran services.

56
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:08,481
it would be helpful to have an actual date of when you're thinking of having the event.

57
00:05:08,981 --> 00:05:16,843
Remember, after next month, the commission goes on hiatus and does not resume again until September.

58
00:05:17,663 --> 00:05:25,325
So any assistance or support that is needed to make sure like that date is required, I can work through it on my end.

59
00:05:25,965 --> 00:05:29,186
But we really need to know like when the date will be.

60
00:05:33,572 --> 00:05:33,932
Perfect.

61
00:05:34,632 --> 00:05:52,779
Cam, did you want to maybe give like three or four dates, like a few dates that would work that don't conflict with anything that's on the city calendar or the dates that they already mentioned and see if any one of those are available just that we kind of have something a little bit more concrete?

62
00:05:55,601 --> 00:06:01,603
Let me find the city calendar and send that to Bobby and pick three dates.

63
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:03,470
Perfect, yeah.

64
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:14,755
And I think just also to remember in the meeting minutes, there's some religious holidays in the fall that we wanna make sure that they don't conflict with.

65
00:06:14,855 --> 00:06:16,415
I can send those again if you need them.

66
00:06:23,658 --> 00:06:24,338
Let's see.

67
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:30,821
Not seeing any of the events that we just talked about in September on the city calendar.

68
00:06:32,441 --> 00:06:37,323
Okay, not all the events the city calendar.

69
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:41,404
There are organizations that book space directly.

70
00:06:41,544 --> 00:06:43,625
So I'm sharing what I've heard.

71
00:06:44,085 --> 00:06:44,425
Got it.

72
00:06:44,545 --> 00:06:44,925
Okay.

73
00:06:48,167 --> 00:06:48,487
Thank you.

74
00:06:50,048 --> 00:06:53,289
So yeah, then in that case, I would go with what we know.

75
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:59,852
If we have certain dates that Frances has shared are booked, not those ones, obviously.

76
00:06:59,932 --> 00:07:10,015
And then if they have to tell us that the dates that are proposed are booked, we can just keep the back and forth going until we find something that's available.

77
00:07:10,615 --> 00:07:17,538
But I think it does make sense to have a date secured sooner rather than later for the reasons Frances stated.

78
00:07:17,698 --> 00:07:18,538
So yeah.

79
00:07:21,122 --> 00:07:22,863
Okay, thank you, Cam.

80
00:07:23,584 --> 00:07:32,690
And if there's any question about, like, if they propose a date and you're not sure if it's going to work, feel free to shoot an email to me or to Frances.

81
00:07:33,831 --> 00:07:34,892
And we can figure it out from there.

82
00:07:41,136 --> 00:07:41,777
Let's see.

83
00:07:41,797 --> 00:07:50,023
I think the next thing on the agenda was the Medford Housing Authority resident engagement process.

84
00:07:52,275 --> 00:07:55,166
In our April meeting, we kind of talked about.

85
00:07:57,595 --> 00:08:20,065
how, Kim, you had received a complaint from a community member about inaccessible housing, and we were kind of trying to get an idea of what resources we're able to share with the person, or if there's some sort of more kind of structured process that we should go through when we receive specific complaints about locations.

86
00:08:20,145 --> 00:08:22,166
I don't know if you had any insight on that, Frances.

87
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:38,634
Typically, if members have something to do with Medford Housing Authority, because it's federal, I reach back out to them directly and ask if they can assist the member in a different way.

88
00:08:38,654 --> 00:08:40,195
I don't bring that.

89
00:08:40,295 --> 00:08:42,197
That's not under our jurisdiction.

90
00:08:43,538 --> 00:08:48,823
Sometimes it's something a lot of times it's more misunderstanding or lack of clarity.

91
00:08:49,384 --> 00:08:57,032
Or that they, the member might want something in that moment in time that the housing authority is not able to do.

92
00:08:57,753 --> 00:09:01,858
But also advising the member of what their rights are.

93
00:09:02,398 --> 00:09:07,702
Again, remember when things are under federal, you can go through the HUD complaint process.

94
00:09:08,223 --> 00:09:09,664
Those numbers are listed.

95
00:09:09,784 --> 00:09:12,566
They can reach out to DCHG.

96
00:09:14,027 --> 00:09:18,911
But there's no overarching 1 way of doing things.

97
00:09:20,912 --> 00:09:29,980
Some of the issues are, unfortunately, sometimes people have to move and yeah, the lift has to go down because it has to be fixed.

98
00:09:31,281 --> 00:09:38,567
Sometimes there is no resolution because it's not what is appealing to the person at that point in time.

99
00:09:39,067 --> 00:09:47,935
But I suggest that if members of the commission are receiving complaints directly from residents, which I had attempted to discuss,

100
00:09:48,395 --> 00:09:56,501
then you reach out to the housing authority so that you can form a relationship and understand what their guidelines are.

101
00:09:57,382 --> 00:10:05,708
A lot of people that live in housing are already in situations where it's very, very difficult.

102
00:10:05,768 --> 00:10:16,436
Sometimes information does not translate accordingly so that that way we're really helping and we're creating more of a sustainable approach.

103
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:22,438
But helping to form that relationship back with the housing authority is key.

104
00:10:23,938 --> 00:10:31,540
And then it helps with our own understanding of what the housing authority is charged to do and cannot do as well.

105
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:35,521
Okay, great.

106
00:10:35,641 --> 00:10:36,021
Thank you.

107
00:10:36,061 --> 00:10:41,722
Yeah, I think that was kind of that was our understanding from the last meeting and then it kind of came back up.

108
00:10:41,782 --> 00:10:42,042
We just.

109
00:10:42,913 --> 00:10:51,139
I think, Cam, and you can correct me if I'm wrong, but you kind of brought it back up from a place of, you know, am I doing everything that I can do for this person?

110
00:10:51,780 --> 00:11:05,750
And it sounds like I think directing them back to the housing authority is going to be the... I heard Frances say reach out and try to form a relationship with the housing authority and see if I could understand their processes better.

111
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:06,851
And I'm happy to do that.

112
00:11:08,953 --> 00:11:09,173
Right.

113
00:11:10,274 --> 00:11:10,594
Thank you.

114
00:11:15,852 --> 00:11:24,917
Okay, so is the next thing that sorry, I have so many tabs open.

115
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:27,399
Where is it?

116
00:11:27,939 --> 00:11:41,408
Okay, so I think would be the email sent regarding the MOD trainings and the disability scoop magazine, which I need to pull those up.

117
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:49,431
Now, I just wanted to talk about some of the things that I'm sending out.

118
00:11:49,871 --> 00:11:55,212
You know, I'm hoping that other folks are paying attention because they're a major thing on the horizon.

119
00:11:55,812 --> 00:12:01,913
Tom, I thought about you the other day with the C meetings when I sent this to the school.

120
00:12:03,193 --> 00:12:11,895
Right now, the Supreme Court is hearing a case on whether or not IEPs should be recorded, and this is a Massachusetts case.

121
00:12:13,276 --> 00:12:20,905
In addition to that, there is being some changes into how much money people who are.

122
00:12:20,925 --> 00:12:27,412
I got to think because there's a couple of changes people who are earning Social Security can make.

123
00:12:28,672 --> 00:12:43,837
or something to the effect that on the surface seems really, really positive, but as disability advocates and people with disabilities are starting to chime in, it actually ends up not being favorable to them.

124
00:12:44,397 --> 00:12:51,720
So I share these materials with you as members of the Disability Commission to keep you informed

125
00:12:52,240 --> 00:13:05,346
on things that could not just directly, let's say, impact your body of work, if that is your body of work, but family members, if you have friends, anybody that identifies as having a disability.

126
00:13:06,106 --> 00:13:21,453
Because if we don't attend or pay attention to like the public meetings and things of that nature now, right, by the time we start paying attention, it's already too late because laws have been changed and things have been in the works.

127
00:13:22,881 --> 00:13:35,765
And a very late thing, tomorrow it will become official, but all I can share at this time is West Medford Commuter Rail Station is on the list for an upgrade.

128
00:13:36,745 --> 00:13:48,289
But I'm not permitted to share any more through the MBTA because they want to make sure that presentation is done accordingly with the award first.

129
00:13:48,389 --> 00:13:51,370
So I will share that for now.

130
00:13:54,877 --> 00:13:55,237
Thank you.

131
00:13:55,317 --> 00:14:06,387
Yeah, so that was all I was saying about the magazines, the trainings that are that, you know, that are going out, like, the information comes to me or more than welcome to to sign up for them yourselves.

132
00:14:06,907 --> 00:14:16,055
But I share anything that comes through that pertains to this commission or other commissions or other people's lines of bodies of work.

133
00:14:19,846 --> 00:14:22,067
but the IEP one is very interesting.

134
00:14:22,107 --> 00:14:25,848
I'm just curious as to how the ruling will go, right?

135
00:14:25,868 --> 00:14:29,770
We talk about, you know, disabilities, ADHD, right?

136
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:37,833
Think about IEP meetings and how long, you know, sometimes those meetings, the person that is there or the parent that might.

137
00:14:38,853 --> 00:14:40,173
I like to follow this stuff.

138
00:14:40,934 --> 00:14:46,776
Let's just say, I mean, gotta be aware of all different aspects of civil rights laws, so.

139
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:50,591
Yeah, so that was my spiel on that.

140
00:14:53,374 --> 00:14:54,154
Thank you, Frances.

141
00:14:54,294 --> 00:15:03,422
I think it's especially important throughout the summer when we're not meeting regularly, when it kind of feels like momentum starts to drop a little bit.

142
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:09,567
So keeping an eye on those trainings and sometimes the webinars that come through.

143
00:15:09,587 --> 00:15:12,230
I don't even know what I'm, I think it's the,

144
00:15:14,423 --> 00:15:19,869
Boston Center for Independent Living, I think, is one of the newsletters that I'm subscribed to.

145
00:15:20,569 --> 00:15:22,591
And they send a lot of really helpful information.

146
00:15:23,853 --> 00:15:28,998
So there's a lot out there, but it's a matter of reading it and engaging with what's sent.

147
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,842
Oh, thank you for sending that in the chat, Frances.

148
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:36,365
Great.

149
00:15:36,385 --> 00:15:36,886
OK.

150
00:15:40,103 --> 00:15:46,188
So for the next item is term expirations.

151
00:15:46,408 --> 00:16:07,225
I think if you haven't contacted Frances already and your term expires in June to let her know, I think the deadline, ideally we were supposed to let you know before today, but if you haven't heard from anyone or if you know that your term is expiring, please let Frances know.

152
00:16:09,996 --> 00:16:16,563
Um, other than that, does anybody have any correspondence or announcements updates?

153
00:16:17,384 --> 00:16:24,611
Well, actually, we had discussed like having the commissioners will continue the conversation about the website, but I don't see that on the agenda.

154
00:16:24,631 --> 00:16:25,812
Were we holding off on that?

155
00:16:25,852 --> 00:16:26,573
Or did we want to?

156
00:16:28,021 --> 00:16:29,382
Table that to another time.

157
00:16:29,402 --> 00:16:31,402
No, not holding off on it.

158
00:16:31,442 --> 00:16:33,803
I mean, you can continue the conversation.

159
00:16:33,843 --> 00:16:35,124
I think that it's helpful.

160
00:16:35,804 --> 00:16:41,386
It's just when I have to put it all together at the very last minute, it can become difficult.

161
00:16:41,446 --> 00:16:45,227
So it just fell off the agenda, but you can continue the conversation.

162
00:16:45,247 --> 00:16:49,549
Let me.

163
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:52,332
I can put the link.

164
00:16:52,692 --> 00:17:02,859
The link was in the notes, the minutes from last meeting, but I'll also stick it in the chat, the link to the document.

165
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:14,168
Are there any other resources folks have thought of since last meeting or been able to find like web pages where the PDFs we want to link to?

166
00:17:16,355 --> 00:17:20,298
are like where we might be able to link to an actual web page instead of a PDF.

167
00:17:20,818 --> 00:17:32,845
I think that's where we left off was we were going to see if there's anything, any links that we could add to it or any web pages where the PDFs are located.

168
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,707
So rather than linking to a PDF, we'd be linking to a web page.

169
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:47,470
I didn't see any updated versions.

170
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:59,259
The only other thing that I could think to do, particularly for the open space and rec plan ones, is to reach out and ask if they have any other format for it.

171
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:04,963
But I think these are mostly Google Drive based, it looks like.

172
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:13,070
And I don't know if that's just where they store their information, or if they have any other available

173
00:18:15,393 --> 00:18:16,914
ways to access it, but I'm not sure.

174
00:18:16,934 --> 00:18:20,558
Yeah, it says owner hidden for all of them.

175
00:18:20,718 --> 00:18:22,680
So it's not very helpful.

176
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:28,005
And that was parks.

177
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,528
Yeah, that's the link.

178
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:38,695
Open space, parks, climate action plan.

179
00:18:42,741 --> 00:18:44,623
Green, let's go the client.

180
00:18:44,643 --> 00:18:52,108
The first one on the Medford climate action and adoption plan looks like it's from go green Medford we have.

181
00:18:53,369 --> 00:18:54,630
Go green Medford.

182
00:18:54,650 --> 00:19:01,535
You have a. URL for that.

183
00:19:01,555 --> 00:19:08,560
This is called climate action and adoption plan.

184
00:19:10,601 --> 00:19:11,502
Let's see if I can.

185
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,481
Find it on there.

186
00:19:16,501 --> 00:19:16,581
Oops.

187
00:19:46,566 --> 00:19:50,028
Well, I'm happy to do a little bit more digging.

188
00:19:54,031 --> 00:20:02,976
Yeah, I'm looking at it now too, and it looks like a lot of the links just takes you back to just the web page for the planning, development, and sustainability.

189
00:20:04,157 --> 00:20:06,958
But I don't know if there's any specific web link.

190
00:20:08,279 --> 00:20:11,921
Planning, development, for sustainability.

191
00:20:11,941 --> 00:20:16,184
Is that on there, the Go Green Medford?

192
00:20:17,312 --> 00:20:18,954
It's on the medfordma.org.

193
00:20:19,114 --> 00:20:22,738
I can send it in the chat.

194
00:20:22,978 --> 00:20:26,621
And that's for the Medford Climate Action and Adoption Plan?

195
00:20:27,963 --> 00:20:28,283
Yes.

196
00:20:28,884 --> 00:20:29,224
OK.

197
00:20:31,326 --> 00:20:32,047
Frances, go ahead.

198
00:20:36,786 --> 00:20:39,288
Thank you, I just thought about something.

199
00:20:39,428 --> 00:20:46,534
Do we know when, is there another big event in October that the Chamber of Commerce runs?

200
00:20:47,215 --> 00:20:59,265
Sorry to be taking us back, but don't want Cameron to go get a date and then we find out that half of Medford has road closures.

201
00:20:59,285 --> 00:21:03,008
Does anybody from Medford know?

202
00:21:05,162 --> 00:21:11,927
I just pulled up the Chamber of Commerce, like their individual website with their calendar.

203
00:21:12,068 --> 00:21:13,449
So let's see if it's on there.

204
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:20,614
I don't know off the top of my head.

205
00:21:21,215 --> 00:21:26,799
It's not on their calendar, but it doesn't look like they update their calendar because it ends in June.

206
00:21:26,819 --> 00:21:26,859
OK.

207
00:21:32,259 --> 00:21:36,323
Maybe I'll reach out to Laura tomorrow just to be sure.

208
00:21:36,343 --> 00:21:40,808
Okay.

209
00:21:41,909 --> 00:21:43,291
When did they do Clippershire?

210
00:21:46,194 --> 00:21:47,455
And Oktoberfest?

211
00:21:47,555 --> 00:21:49,858
I think the chamber does Oktoberfest.

212
00:21:53,121 --> 00:21:54,122
That sounds right.

213
00:22:02,945 --> 00:22:08,448
It looks like Clippership Day has been in July.

214
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:09,508
Okay.

215
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:09,608
2021 and 2022.

216
00:22:10,148 --> 00:22:10,568
I don't see it for 2023.

217
00:22:10,609 --> 00:22:10,709
Okay.

218
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:12,409
It looks like the year before that they did it in May.

219
00:22:12,569 --> 00:22:14,030
Seems to be a spring summer.

220
00:22:27,775 --> 00:22:30,276
but that doesn't mean that they didn't do it in October before.

221
00:22:30,296 --> 00:22:30,336
OK.

222
00:22:31,257 --> 00:22:34,018
And then they did Oktoberfest last year, I think.

223
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:36,359
Yeah, let me see.

224
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:45,744
I'll reach out to them, Cameron, so that I can get you that date, so that way you'll know to avoid it.

225
00:22:48,345 --> 00:22:48,585
Right.

226
00:22:49,746 --> 00:22:54,188
Oktoberfest last year was on September 30th.

227
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:58,837
Okay, maybe they can make it in September.

228
00:22:59,017 --> 00:23:01,962
All right, I'll find out from Laura.

229
00:23:03,185 --> 00:23:03,806
Thank you.

230
00:23:03,826 --> 00:23:04,748
Thank you.

231
00:23:08,602 --> 00:23:11,903
Yeah, going back to the links, I have another question about the climate.

232
00:23:12,983 --> 00:23:13,623
I see the link.

233
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:17,904
We've got a link here that goes to the Go Green Confronting Climate Change, which is great.

234
00:23:18,164 --> 00:23:19,585
Thanks for whoever found that.

235
00:23:19,965 --> 00:23:24,746
So we have a link to the Go Green, like Go Green Medford in general.

236
00:23:25,686 --> 00:23:37,409
Does the Confronting Climate Change, the action plan and adoption, is that another specific type of resource for folks with disabilities?

237
00:23:41,377 --> 00:23:46,440
So all I did was I just Googled it to get that link.

238
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:51,042
I don't know if there's more than that.

239
00:23:53,203 --> 00:24:07,730
Yeah, I guess as I'm looking at this, since it's all related to that same website, I guess I'm not sure I understand if that's a separate resource that we want to point to and highlight out.

240
00:24:09,655 --> 00:24:16,499
Or if we want to keep it to just the Go Green Medford website in general?

241
00:24:16,519 --> 00:24:23,664
Yeah, I don't know.

242
00:24:23,684 --> 00:24:29,647
I don't know how much people will see it that it's related specifically to disabilities.

243
00:24:29,667 --> 00:24:36,111
Sorry, Linda, this is for the climate action and adaptation plan, that one?

244
00:24:36,812 --> 00:24:37,212
Yeah.

245
00:24:37,352 --> 00:24:38,393
Yeah, we found a link.

246
00:24:39,854 --> 00:24:45,981
And, and since it's part of the go green website and I was just wondering if this has a specific.

247
00:24:48,323 --> 00:24:56,552
Like we wanted to call attention specifically to the the confronting climate change as a separate resource for folks with disabilities.

248
00:25:00,042 --> 00:25:16,635
I mean, just from very briefly looking at it right now, it looks like it gives some interesting health information about environmental impacts on health and things like that, that I guess is maybe not an information source.

249
00:25:18,256 --> 00:25:26,722
I don't think it necessarily trying to be really intentional about what we include here, which I think is also OK.

250
00:25:27,623 --> 00:25:28,824
I don't think there's a right or wrong.

251
00:25:30,668 --> 00:25:34,410
I think it would also be okay to exclude.

252
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:37,212
I don't know how dated this is.

253
00:25:37,292 --> 00:25:48,138
This was from January 2019, the last climate vulnerability assessment.

254
00:25:53,702 --> 00:25:54,362
Yeah, I mean,

255
00:25:59,962 --> 00:26:02,743
I don't know how helpful it will be, but I don't think that it hurts to have it there.

256
00:26:03,363 --> 00:26:14,487
My line of thinking with this is if we include them, we want to include every other resource on what else would be helpful on the Go Green Medford website.

257
00:26:14,687 --> 00:26:18,929
Is it just in climate change, or are there other things on this that we want to highlight?

258
00:26:19,709 --> 00:26:22,270
I think it's kind of a scope.

259
00:26:23,293 --> 00:26:43,640
question of like what's really helpful for folks and if highlighting this is really helpful then are there other things that we want to highlight you know kind of unbury you know pull out and say these are the helpful things on the go green medford site and likewise on anything else like these are the really helpful things on like

260
00:26:45,573 --> 00:26:50,257
like mass health, like I see you putting in there, like how to enroll and things like that.

261
00:26:50,277 --> 00:27:05,609
Yeah, if there's like specific things within each of these resources that we want to highlight, then I think we just want to be intentional about that as well and think about like, oh, why are we including this but not these other things?

262
00:27:06,229 --> 00:27:11,894
So that if someone's like looking at the site, it kind of makes sense as to

263
00:27:14,307 --> 00:27:26,619
which things were highlighting on here, and that we're not like opening ourselves up to, to like questions of like, well, why isn't this other thing included?

264
00:27:28,917 --> 00:27:37,162
Yeah, I think could have at the bottom of the page kind of something like, you know, this is not meant to be a completely comprehensive list.

265
00:27:37,202 --> 00:27:43,807
These are just like some suggestions of helpful links something that effect and then we can put like, you know, we'll update this as.

266
00:27:44,647 --> 00:27:51,270
as more resources come to our attention, something along those lines, so that it's kind of like, this isn't everything, but this is a good starting point.

267
00:27:52,630 --> 00:28:03,794
But I do like the idea of pointing out, for example, some of the mass.gov resource pages are such a rabbit hole, where you end up clicking on 50 links just to get to what you really wanted.

268
00:28:04,075 --> 00:28:08,176
So I do like the idea of kind of saying, specifically, check out this link or this page.

269
00:28:11,675 --> 00:28:16,540
So I think that where we can and where we think that it makes sense, I think that would be really helpful.

270
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:24,468
As far as the Go Green Medford website, I'm kind of looking at their sub pages now.

271
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:32,757
And maybe there isn't anything that would be super helpful from an accessibility standpoint.

272
00:28:34,243 --> 00:28:43,245
potentially could be is the safe routes to school program that's supposed to increase walking, biking, and rolling to school.

273
00:28:43,645 --> 00:28:52,547
I assume that all of those routes would have been assessed for curb cuts if they're encouraging kids to bike to school.

274
00:28:53,787 --> 00:28:54,508
But I could be wrong.

275
00:28:54,768 --> 00:28:55,828
So I don't know.

276
00:28:57,298 --> 00:29:02,922
But I think as far as an access standpoint, I think that would probably be helpful here.

277
00:29:02,982 --> 00:29:05,044
I can send the link that I'm referring to.

278
00:29:05,164 --> 00:29:05,544
I found it.

279
00:29:05,864 --> 00:29:08,326
I was looking for it as soon as you said it.

280
00:29:08,526 --> 00:29:10,227
OK, so that makes sense.

281
00:29:10,287 --> 00:29:15,491
Do you think that the confronting climate change link still makes sense to include?

282
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:20,014
Yeah, I mean, I didn't read it closely.

283
00:29:20,034 --> 00:29:22,276
I think anything that

284
00:29:25,398 --> 00:29:35,885
talks about air quality and health in that way, I think could be relevant, but I don't know if it's super necessary.

285
00:29:35,905 --> 00:29:40,208
If you think it's relevant, then I say go for it.

286
00:29:40,608 --> 00:29:47,513
It was just more of a I am not experienced in that area, so I was just asking if that was the case.

287
00:29:49,836 --> 00:29:50,857
Yeah, I mean, I think so.

288
00:29:50,977 --> 00:30:09,650
I think that access to clean air and housing that's in places that have been vetted for different environmental health risks can contribute to people with disabilities' quality of life and their health overall.

289
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:12,112
So I think it could be helpful for some people.

290
00:30:13,033 --> 00:30:13,934
Perfect, great.

291
00:30:14,254 --> 00:30:17,737
Okay, so then, oh, and then we've got path and park developments.

292
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:19,259
Yes, okay, perfect.

293
00:30:19,459 --> 00:30:20,860
Whoever put that in there, thank you.

294
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,442
I'm gonna add that to the go green.

295
00:30:23,462 --> 00:30:35,073
That was called park and path, park and path developments.

296
00:30:45,237 --> 00:30:46,077
Okay, great.

297
00:30:46,398 --> 00:31:05,068
So we've got kind of like, under go green Medford, we've got like three resources there, informational, and then scrolling back up to the to the top here, we've got mass health, and I'm just gonna make this like a bulleted list.

298
00:31:05,108 --> 00:31:06,649
We've got how to enroll.

299
00:31:08,145 --> 00:31:15,712
Massachusetts Department of Disability Services, Metro, North Area Office.

300
00:31:16,233 --> 00:31:17,794
How do enroll?

301
00:31:18,335 --> 00:31:23,019
Do we think a link just in general to Massachusetts Department of Disability Services would be valuable?

302
00:31:25,981 --> 00:31:30,045
You enroll either with forms or the local area.

303
00:31:30,646 --> 00:31:31,687
But yeah, I could add it.

304
00:31:32,943 --> 00:31:38,147
Okay, I don't even, do I have it written down wrong when I Google it?

305
00:31:38,227 --> 00:31:41,189
Like it doesn't, maybe I have it written wrong.

306
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:46,513
I have, oh wait, no, wait, Office of Disability, is that right?

307
00:31:48,778 --> 00:31:52,920
I've got... Are you looking for the Mass Office on Disability?

308
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,641
That is almost like the governing agency.

309
00:31:55,721 --> 00:31:57,702
They're like your right hand partner.

310
00:31:57,782 --> 00:32:00,023
I think that's the one that you would want.

311
00:32:00,823 --> 00:32:04,064
They provide everything from resources.

312
00:32:04,144 --> 00:32:11,107
They're different from Massachusetts Disability Services, which is also different.

313
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:16,338
from Massachusetts Department of Disability.

314
00:32:16,518 --> 00:32:22,027
So I think you're thinking about Mass Office on Disability, MOD.

315
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:25,032
That's a big one.

316
00:32:25,858 --> 00:32:30,002
It looks like we've got Mass Department of Development Services.

317
00:32:30,182 --> 00:32:36,987
I'm not finding a Department of Disability Services, but I am finding Massachusetts Office on Disability.

318
00:32:37,528 --> 00:32:38,609
You should have that one.

319
00:32:38,769 --> 00:32:47,996
That should be your main one because that allows individuals to have a direct route to file reports and things of that nature.

320
00:32:49,338 --> 00:32:50,298
That's the big one.

321
00:32:50,318 --> 00:32:53,501
All right.

322
00:32:53,841 --> 00:32:54,122
Awesome.

323
00:32:54,142 --> 00:32:54,422
Thank you.

324
00:32:56,261 --> 00:32:57,962
Office on Disability.

325
00:33:00,123 --> 00:33:07,967
In that case, would we want to include like DDS, like the Department of Developmental Services as well?

326
00:33:08,688 --> 00:33:10,029
Yeah, it looks like that's on there.

327
00:33:10,549 --> 00:33:11,829
Let me ask you this.

328
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:19,794
Are you going to include all the other agencies that service people with various disabilities?

329
00:33:21,423 --> 00:33:27,146
No, because it's not going to be possible and we're going to run out of space, right?

330
00:33:27,186 --> 00:33:30,287
Because we don't know all the disabilities out there.

331
00:33:31,008 --> 00:33:41,072
So what you might want to do is include a link to like, let's say a mass, the mass.gov page where people can visit.

332
00:33:41,192 --> 00:33:48,516
And at least there'll be a search bar that allows them, you know, to put something else in.

333
00:33:50,299 --> 00:33:56,206
Because remember, you would have DDS deals with developmental and intellectual.

334
00:34:01,315 --> 00:34:08,759
which are disabilities and Office of Aging is, age is correlated with disability and frailty.

335
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:12,722
Department of Mental Health deals with disability as well.

336
00:34:13,082 --> 00:34:27,050
So I think we got the major departments that support folks with disability and they each have their own enrollment process and really useful services.

337
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:29,332
And I feel like if we just put mass.gov

338
00:34:31,514 --> 00:34:37,399
We're not making it easy for our community members to understand what they're eligible for and how to enroll.

339
00:34:45,627 --> 00:34:47,609
Yeah, I think that makes sense.

340
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:51,033
The only thing that I could think if we're worried about

341
00:34:53,344 --> 00:35:02,688
like taking up too much space on the webpage is we could have like a C, like click here for.

342
00:35:03,188 --> 00:35:09,971
Yes, something that kind of lists then all of the mass.gov resources separately, but it's still there.

343
00:35:10,391 --> 00:35:15,173
So like it would be one more click, but we would still have it available.

344
00:35:15,533 --> 00:35:18,974
I do, I completely understand what you're saying, but we want to have kind of,

345
00:35:20,735 --> 00:35:30,117
Because in health law, we see this often is that people don't know what they qualify for or what's out there and people aren't getting kind of the information that they need.

346
00:35:30,177 --> 00:35:34,679
So if we have it somewhere, I think it's better than not having it at all.

347
00:35:37,279 --> 00:35:47,302
So if you're in Medford, do you not think that it's better to have the listing go directly to the catchment area that Medford is in, right?

348
00:35:47,988 --> 00:35:52,230
So these agencies all have different catchment areas.

349
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:54,731
And we put that in there as well.

350
00:35:54,831 --> 00:36:04,036
So for DDS, the Medford catchment area is Metro North and we've linked it.

351
00:36:04,156 --> 00:36:07,958
So you've got your developmental and intellectual covered.

352
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:26,130
services for autism you mentioned elder you mentioned elder services so you would need to put in like mystic valley and something and a state one if you can find it yep we have it it's in there

353
00:36:32,497 --> 00:36:34,238
Is it helpful to share screens?

354
00:36:34,779 --> 00:36:35,359
Go ahead, Linda.

355
00:36:35,399 --> 00:36:39,723
I'm going to go stamp your meeting minutes so that you guys can have them.

356
00:36:42,465 --> 00:36:53,294
I can try to, I found a web, our web page that has like an accordion, and I was going to show what that looks like here, but I'll need permission to share my screen.

357
00:36:58,782 --> 00:37:01,643
Okay, maybe I'll just do it without sharing screen.

358
00:37:01,683 --> 00:37:04,243
So on, if you, I'll pop it into, how about this?

359
00:37:04,343 --> 00:37:05,763
I'll pop the link into the chat.

360
00:37:11,644 --> 00:37:12,144
Oh, there you go.

361
00:37:12,164 --> 00:37:14,005
It looks like you were made the co-host.

362
00:37:14,145 --> 00:37:14,445
Okay.

363
00:37:14,745 --> 00:37:15,245
Oh, there we go.

364
00:37:15,445 --> 00:37:15,945
Okay, great.

365
00:37:17,926 --> 00:37:25,587
So if we go to our page, what our page looks like right now, they have these accordion, which what I'm imagining,

366
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:32,143
we would do is we would have an accordion for each one of these headers.

367
00:37:33,404 --> 00:37:35,045
And we would have three accordions.

368
00:37:35,445 --> 00:37:37,126
That's how I would see this translating.

369
00:37:37,146 --> 00:37:45,151
So we would have an accordion for services, and it would pop down.

370
00:37:45,171 --> 00:37:50,874
And we would have an accordion titled informational resources, and it would pop down.

371
00:37:51,875 --> 00:37:54,336
And then newsletter signups, and it would pop down.

372
00:37:56,579 --> 00:38:03,904
Since that's something that's already functional within the site, we know that the person who's editing the web page can do that.

373
00:38:04,184 --> 00:38:12,229
And that makes it super easy for them to hopefully just, boop, like copy paste it in there, make sure the links work.

374
00:38:13,709 --> 00:38:15,671
With that in mind, back to,

375
00:38:18,454 --> 00:38:23,816
you know, back to Francis's point about keeping things, you know, not too long.

376
00:38:25,617 --> 00:38:42,903
If we can keep that in mind of like, when you, you know, when you pop this down, how many links do you see, you know, in like, on mobile or like on your desktop, and keep it to I think this is a lot.

377
00:38:43,838 --> 00:38:46,341
So what we're looking at right now.

378
00:38:46,841 --> 00:38:53,568
So I think if we keep it to less than what we have right now under useful links, I think that would be great.

379
00:38:54,549 --> 00:38:58,553
And I think right now we're sitting pretty with that.

380
00:38:58,793 --> 00:38:59,794
We're OK with that.

381
00:39:01,476 --> 00:39:05,620
The informational resources might be getting a little bit long, especially with the text.

382
00:39:06,624 --> 00:39:10,365
So just keeping that in mind of like what it's going to look like on the, on the web.

383
00:39:11,125 --> 00:39:16,146
And we're not going to have the CL, we have these labels, it's the governmental agency financial information.

384
00:39:16,586 --> 00:39:17,906
We're not going to have those.

385
00:39:18,426 --> 00:39:20,266
So those won't take up as much space.

386
00:39:21,086 --> 00:39:26,047
My thought is that we would literally have these links underneath.

387
00:39:26,407 --> 00:39:35,349
Like we would again, tell them like replace useful links with services and put those in there, add an accordion that says.

388
00:39:36,432 --> 00:39:39,594
informational resources and put that in there.

389
00:39:39,614 --> 00:39:44,838
Is that kind of in line with what folks are thinking?

390
00:39:46,959 --> 00:39:56,886
So I think as long as we keep them, as you're making a list, keep them to, I don't know how many links are here.

391
00:39:56,906 --> 00:39:59,648
I think, again, not having these headings will save us some space.

392
00:39:59,668 --> 00:39:59,648
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

393
00:40:01,609 --> 00:40:05,972
Let's see how many we have.

394
00:40:09,068 --> 00:40:32,400
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

395
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:32,400
I think if we keep it to where we start with what we have under services now, and see for a first iteration, and keep what we have under informational resources right now, and what we have under newsletter signups as the first iteration, and then see how it looks.

396
00:40:33,337 --> 00:40:40,282
then we can kind of do a second round of edits and just have this as a good starting point.

397
00:40:41,163 --> 00:40:45,926
And then again, do a second round if necessary.

398
00:40:45,946 --> 00:40:47,327
And I can stop sharing now.

399
00:40:50,269 --> 00:40:52,170
Does that sound like a decent plan?

400
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:53,852
I think that makes sense.

401
00:40:54,132 --> 00:41:00,196
I think as long as we have a deep starting point, like if you get to the MOD website,

402
00:41:02,505 --> 00:41:07,129
Of course, it takes clicking, and we want things to be as accessible and user-friendly as possible.

403
00:41:07,169 --> 00:41:11,192
But at least having some of those links there, I think, is better than not having them.

404
00:41:12,012 --> 00:41:17,997
And then we can kind of see how it looks, and we can click around and see what makes sense and what doesn't.

405
00:41:18,337 --> 00:41:26,784
When you shared your screen, you reminded me, I think, that our placard information is outdated.

406
00:41:32,048 --> 00:41:32,468
One second.

407
00:41:34,149 --> 00:41:35,350
Yeah, we could totally add that too.

408
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:40,533
I also, as I was scrolling down on our links page, I totally missed our social media.

409
00:41:40,553 --> 00:41:43,935
It got somehow shifted onto another page.

410
00:41:43,975 --> 00:41:46,517
So we'll obviously add social media as another down.

411
00:41:48,338 --> 00:41:51,840
Not to make anyone think we forgot about the social media there.

412
00:41:53,032 --> 00:41:57,733
And we can also add a sentence that you were talking about, Gabby.

413
00:41:57,773 --> 00:42:03,315
I put that at the very bottom and said, this is not meant to be a comprehensive list, and we'll update the list as we learn of new resources.

414
00:42:03,335 --> 00:42:06,976
So that I captured at the bottom there.

415
00:42:06,996 --> 00:42:13,218
And we can decide if we want that at the top of the section

416
00:42:18,364 --> 00:42:22,747
And right now, we have that section that's just called additional links, which I think we should rename.

417
00:42:22,768 --> 00:42:26,811
But we could say like additional resources or something.

418
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:42,483
And I might advocate to put the sentence up there so people see that first and foremost before looking at the resources to know that this isn't just to have that as context.

419
00:42:46,366 --> 00:42:47,527
Yeah, I think that makes sense.

420
00:42:55,038 --> 00:42:55,538
I don't know.

421
00:42:59,521 --> 00:43:07,587
And did we want to, like while we're updating, did we want to, we don't have to do it right now, but maybe go through and see the links that are currently there.

422
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:08,688
I've never gone through them.

423
00:43:09,789 --> 00:43:14,292
And see if anything is outdated or if any links are broken, things like that.

424
00:43:16,954 --> 00:43:23,519
Yeah, that would be great because right now, right now, I don't even know if any of those links are on our,

425
00:43:25,723 --> 00:43:26,724
current page.

426
00:43:26,744 --> 00:43:28,305
I haven't cross-referenced them.

427
00:43:28,925 --> 00:43:35,068
I was just operating under the assumption that the ones that we have on the Google Doc are the ones that we want to use.

428
00:43:37,290 --> 00:43:45,895
So if there's anything that's on the current page that we want to keep, then I would suggest making sure that that's added to the Google Doc.

429
00:43:47,756 --> 00:43:48,576
OK, perfect.

430
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:58,282
I know when we first created the new website, we put a lot of effort into pulling together those resources.

431
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:04,003
So I think it's a good idea to go through and make sure we identify what we want to keep.

432
00:44:04,023 --> 00:44:06,704
OK.

433
00:44:11,445 --> 00:44:15,246
Yeah, because from first glance, they all look like they're pretty helpful.

434
00:44:18,936 --> 00:44:23,298
Yeah, I know, I know, for instance, tested a lot of them to make sure that they were up to date too.

435
00:44:23,939 --> 00:44:33,584
Okay, so maybe we can put that on the agenda for the next meeting is to kind of go over what's.

436
00:44:35,085 --> 00:44:39,447
What's there and decide what we want to keep or remove kind of as a group.

437
00:44:41,368 --> 00:44:47,252
Okay, I'm just writing it down, so I don't lose it.

438
00:44:51,704 --> 00:45:03,853
And I'll look into the accessible parking placard because I'm 90% sure it's out of date, or it was out of date.

439
00:45:03,893 --> 00:45:04,854
Maybe we updated it since.

440
00:45:04,894 --> 00:45:11,379
And I have some sort of recollection that something was outdated last time I looked at it.

441
00:45:11,399 --> 00:45:12,060
OK.

442
00:45:13,401 --> 00:45:13,681
Great.

443
00:45:14,982 --> 00:45:19,065
Linda, did you have any other

444
00:45:21,482 --> 00:45:28,347
thoughts, questions, specifics on the website for now or anything that you want to put on the agenda for the next meeting?

445
00:45:29,388 --> 00:45:41,678
No, nothing other than just finalizing the resources that should go on there and getting it to a place where we feel comfortable sending it off to the communications folks to update on the page.

446
00:45:43,579 --> 00:45:43,900
Perfect.

447
00:45:46,242 --> 00:45:46,602
Thank you.

448
00:45:48,185 --> 00:46:02,952
And Gabby, I added a section on the document for the, oops, I can't seem to type, the placard and sign information for parking.

449
00:46:03,572 --> 00:46:07,994
So feel free to add it to the doc.

450
00:46:08,774 --> 00:46:10,375
It's at the bottom of the doc.

451
00:46:11,736 --> 00:46:15,378
And we can decide whether we want that as a separate accordion, probably.

452
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:25,543
Yeah, I want to add.

453
00:46:25,643 --> 00:46:29,525
There's the info on the home health care parking permit also.

454
00:46:29,905 --> 00:46:37,348
Like if you have somebody that comes to your house regularly, they can get like a separate permit if you're on a permit street.

455
00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:41,630
So I want to add that too.

456
00:46:41,650 --> 00:46:42,751
OK.

457
00:46:44,352 --> 00:46:44,712
Perfect.

458
00:46:44,872 --> 00:46:44,912
OK.

459
00:46:46,856 --> 00:46:47,096
Great.

460
00:46:47,897 --> 00:46:51,600
I will add those links after this meeting.

461
00:46:54,363 --> 00:46:54,643
Great.

462
00:46:57,906 --> 00:46:59,387
And let's see.

463
00:47:00,088 --> 00:47:03,310
Nice job, everyone, on collecting resources and keeping this up to date.

464
00:47:04,351 --> 00:47:05,492
There's a lot of good stuff there.

465
00:47:05,672 --> 00:47:10,717
I think it's a good starting point, at the very least.

466
00:47:12,537 --> 00:47:17,520
Yeah, and I definitely commend everyone for wanting to take a look at it and update it every year.

467
00:47:22,042 --> 00:47:22,483
Yeah.

468
00:47:22,543 --> 00:47:30,667
And I think especially as links change so often, especially with the mass.gov website, they're not very good at redirecting their links timely.

469
00:47:30,687 --> 00:47:34,069
I think it's a good thing to stay on top of.

470
00:47:36,731 --> 00:47:36,971
Great.

471
00:47:37,251 --> 00:47:41,514
OK, so we have those agenda items that we'll put on the agenda for next month.

472
00:47:42,702 --> 00:47:46,185
Um, does anybody else have anything that they wanted to.

473
00:47:46,205 --> 00:47:50,327
Add work on discuss this meeting.

474
00:47:56,812 --> 00:47:57,512
No, okay.

475
00:47:59,450 --> 00:48:06,776
So I think other than that, we just have the correspondence and announcements for upcoming city events.

476
00:48:07,797 --> 00:48:09,379
So May is a bunch of months.

477
00:48:09,439 --> 00:48:15,064
There's Asian and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, Haitian American Heritage Month, Mental Health Awareness Month.

478
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:20,802
And then there's also two upcoming, what is today?

479
00:48:20,822 --> 00:48:21,402
Is today the 23rd?

480
00:48:21,602 --> 00:48:22,262
No, tomorrow.

481
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:29,026
Tomorrow is a pizza and paint party at Medford High with the GSA and Chameleon Club from 2.45 to 5 p.m.

482
00:48:31,988 --> 00:48:40,554
Um, and then also the pride flag raising and festival will be at 4 PM to 7 30 PM at city hall on May 31st.

483
00:48:41,315 --> 00:48:48,220
And I think that Francis sent an email about looking for volunteers possibly.

484
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:48,960
Let me see.

485
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:52,843
Or did I make that up?

486
00:48:54,965 --> 00:48:56,706
I swear I saw something.

487
00:48:56,726 --> 00:48:56,766
Um,

488
00:49:02,413 --> 00:49:05,035
Maybe I made that up.

489
00:49:06,896 --> 00:49:07,016
OK.

490
00:49:07,176 --> 00:49:13,201
It's not coming up in my immediate inbox right now, but maybe my search feature is not moving.

491
00:49:13,221 --> 00:49:14,142
I didn't search the right word.

492
00:49:14,182 --> 00:49:14,482
I don't know.

493
00:49:15,783 --> 00:49:20,446
But yeah, those are the upcoming events for the rest of the month.

494
00:49:21,527 --> 00:49:27,571
And I think I sent, I don't know if you saw the, I sent a link.

495
00:49:28,852 --> 00:49:34,394
in the chat cam, it's like the Medford Arts online event calendar.

496
00:49:36,034 --> 00:49:44,877
They don't have much after September, but just as like another place to check if you get a date and you want to cross-check it.

497
00:49:45,817 --> 00:49:49,098
It looks like that has a pretty good comprehensive list of events.

498
00:49:51,699 --> 00:49:54,640
Something else to keep an eye on.

499
00:49:56,591 --> 00:49:57,692
It feels really early.

500
00:49:57,712 --> 00:50:05,378
I don't know if we have anything else that we need to cover, or if anybody wants to take this time to look at more links.

501
00:50:05,398 --> 00:50:10,442
Hi, it's Joe.

502
00:50:10,462 --> 00:50:14,505
Can I just kick an idea out there for the disability fair?

503
00:50:15,125 --> 00:50:16,346
Of course, please.

504
00:50:18,363 --> 00:50:27,772
I want to first apologize, the last two meetings I couldn't make, two emergencies just came up, and again, I just want to apologize.

505
00:50:28,753 --> 00:50:36,721
As far as Disability Fair, I was thinking of volunteering to give out ice cream.

506
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:46,972
I have a connection that somebody would donate ice cream to me and I just want to just kick it out there.

507
00:50:47,712 --> 00:50:55,894
If it's a good idea or a bad idea, because I think it's a good reason to get people maybe out of the house to say, hey, if I go, I get an ice cream.

508
00:50:57,334 --> 00:50:59,195
And I just thought I'd throw it out there.

509
00:51:02,451 --> 00:51:04,412
Yeah, I think that's a lovely idea.

510
00:51:04,432 --> 00:51:14,576
I assume that it's fine as long as the I assume that the school doesn't have I guess we would have to run it by them like, or is it okay if we serve ice cream?

511
00:51:16,017 --> 00:51:18,098
But I think that's correct.

512
00:51:19,358 --> 00:51:21,139
And ideally, yep.

513
00:51:22,119 --> 00:51:23,640
Is that the plan for now, Kim?

514
00:51:25,631 --> 00:51:29,154
So we want to also take advantage of the inclusive playground.

515
00:51:29,234 --> 00:51:34,678
So if it makes it easier for us to serve ice cream, I think we could do it outside.

516
00:51:34,698 --> 00:51:41,023
I think the city of Medford puts on events where they have free food.

517
00:51:41,063 --> 00:51:45,106
So I'm hoping this is not too crazy of an ask.

518
00:51:45,206 --> 00:51:45,847
Joe, I love it.

519
00:51:46,007 --> 00:51:47,228
It's a fun idea.

520
00:51:47,768 --> 00:51:48,749
I think it's a great idea.

521
00:51:48,789 --> 00:51:49,850
Yeah, I don't think that it would

522
00:51:50,609 --> 00:51:54,753
I guess we have to ask, but I don't see it being an issue.

523
00:51:54,773 --> 00:51:55,673
I think it's a great idea.

524
00:51:55,693 --> 00:51:58,816
That was great.

525
00:51:58,876 --> 00:52:04,941
We could also, I'm getting a little ahead of ourselves, once we have a date and things like that, we could always see if there's other local

526
00:52:07,263 --> 00:52:33,871
like there's um like a gift and craft store uh near like south medford area um like they have all types of like little events and things like that if we want to have like community members do like little demos of crafts and things like we could kind of have more like structured than just having tables like maybe have like offer a little little treats like that like having ice cream or having you know or something like that to kind of get people more

527
00:52:34,896 --> 00:52:36,096
Yeah, exactly.

528
00:52:36,116 --> 00:52:37,857
To get people to go.

529
00:52:41,377 --> 00:52:49,279
I was at the last Disability Fair, and I think a lot of people know what's out there.

530
00:52:51,080 --> 00:53:02,402
And I just feel that it would be a good magnet to get people just to come by and give them a reason that you can't screw up a free ice cream.

531
00:53:04,948 --> 00:53:05,909
And that's all.

532
00:53:06,889 --> 00:53:07,690
I completely agree.

533
00:53:07,870 --> 00:53:21,539
I think that's a great idea, especially if we want to try to cater to like more kids and things like that, because I know that there weren't, it wasn't, there were some families at the last event, but it wasn't like a super family friendly event.

534
00:53:21,579 --> 00:53:25,522
Like we didn't do too much to try and make, to really encourage people to go.

535
00:53:25,542 --> 00:53:28,024
That's a great way.

536
00:53:28,044 --> 00:53:29,725
I love that idea.

537
00:53:34,033 --> 00:53:34,273
Great.

538
00:53:35,254 --> 00:53:42,799
I'm going to write that down so that we have it when we start planning more concrete ideas for the day of.

539
00:53:42,819 --> 00:53:44,500
Thank you, Gabby.

540
00:53:45,061 --> 00:53:45,461
Thank you.

541
00:53:45,481 --> 00:53:50,504
Does anybody have anything else?

542
00:53:54,567 --> 00:53:54,727
No?

543
00:53:55,588 --> 00:53:55,888
OK.

544
00:53:57,649 --> 00:54:00,751
I don't think that we'll get any public participation.

545
00:54:00,771 --> 00:54:03,213
I think it's a little bit late usually.

546
00:54:04,225 --> 00:54:06,346
people will come in the beginning if they're planning to.

547
00:54:06,766 --> 00:54:10,688
So I think it's okay if someone wants to make a motion to adjourn.

548
00:54:17,592 --> 00:54:18,793
I'll make a motion to adjourn.

549
00:54:20,173 --> 00:54:20,774
I'll second.

550
00:54:22,595 --> 00:54:23,535
Any abstentions?

551
00:54:26,677 --> 00:54:27,497
All in favor?

552
00:54:27,918 --> 00:54:28,318
Aye.

553
00:54:29,258 --> 00:54:29,378
Aye.

554
00:54:30,199 --> 00:54:30,339
Aye.

555
00:54:32,135 --> 00:54:32,355
Great.

556
00:54:32,996 --> 00:54:34,037
Thank you so much, everyone.

557
00:54:34,798 --> 00:54:37,862
Linda, I'll add those links now with the extra time that we have.

558
00:54:39,344 --> 00:54:42,988
And yeah, and I'll send the draft meeting when it's over shortly.

559
00:54:43,689 --> 00:54:43,869
Great.

560
00:54:44,450 --> 00:54:45,331
Thanks so much, everyone.

561
00:54:45,351 --> 00:54:45,411
Bye.
