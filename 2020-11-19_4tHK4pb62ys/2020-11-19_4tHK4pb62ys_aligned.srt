1
00:00:00,071 --> 00:00:02,653
just, you know, quickly introduce ourselves that could be helpful.

2
00:00:03,133 --> 00:00:08,898
Again, I'm Melanie McLaughlin, school committee member, chair of the special education behavioral health subcommittee.

3
00:00:10,659 --> 00:00:16,003
Stacey, do you want to go ahead while I somebody's texting me about a link, so I'll send it over to them now.

4
00:00:16,724 --> 00:00:17,164
Sure.

5
00:00:17,224 --> 00:00:17,825
Hi, good evening.

6
00:00:17,865 --> 00:00:18,746
I'm Stacey Shulman.

7
00:00:18,806 --> 00:00:21,948
I'm the director of school counseling and behavioral health for Medford Public Schools.

8
00:00:27,192 --> 00:00:29,494
I'm the director of pupil services.

9
00:00:32,555 --> 00:00:33,495
I'm Tanya Sullivan.

10
00:00:33,735 --> 00:00:37,076
I am the co-chair of the Medford Special Education Parent Advisory Council.

11
00:00:42,938 --> 00:00:47,179
I'm Charlotte Heim, Occupational Therapist and Transition Specialist at the high school.

12
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,241
Maurice Edward Vincent, Superintendent of Schools.

13
00:00:54,201 --> 00:00:57,082
Suzanne Galluzzi, Assistant Superintendent of Elementary Education.

14
00:01:02,495 --> 00:01:03,216
I'm Susie Weiss.

15
00:01:03,236 --> 00:01:06,119
I'm the assistant to the superintendent.

16
00:01:06,199 --> 00:01:06,939
I'm taking notes.

17
00:01:12,885 --> 00:01:15,187
I'm the assistant superintendent.

18
00:01:15,207 --> 00:01:17,089
I'm currently babysitting, a.k.a.

19
00:01:17,229 --> 00:01:18,791
parenting, according to my wife.

20
00:01:19,972 --> 00:01:21,373
Yeah, dads don't babysit.

21
00:01:24,596 --> 00:01:25,157
Much agreed.

22
00:01:29,324 --> 00:01:31,305
Susie, can you do me a favor and just send me the link?

23
00:01:31,565 --> 00:01:38,727
Instead of having me trying to hunt it down right now, I have a community member that's trying to find the link via Zoom and is having difficulty.

24
00:01:39,347 --> 00:01:39,847
Yep, I will.

25
00:01:42,948 --> 00:01:45,628
So let me just get back to the agenda for a second here.

26
00:01:48,927 --> 00:02:04,251
So we were going to talk about identifying research and best practices to inform policy recommendations and addressing the behavioral health subcommittee goal of supporting trauma-informed schools for MPS in the 2020-2021 school year.

27
00:02:05,231 --> 00:02:11,033
One of the things that I would really like to see happen just off the top, and I just did email Susie about this as well,

28
00:02:11,793 --> 00:02:36,588
um is just finding a uniform way in which we're putting together our um subcommittee meeting notes um hopefully on the on the website because other members aside from the people who have access to the google drive the school committee members need to be able to see these minutes so that we can refer to them and in our subsequent meetings right so that we can look back so that everybody has access to looking back on them um for the next meeting so that we can

29
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:38,059
can see them.

30
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:44,054
We've also had, I have anyway, I think it's been, I think it was just sent to the general school committee.

31
00:02:44,074 --> 00:02:45,297
We had some questions about

32
00:02:46,512 --> 00:02:56,354
where these recordings were being posted or whether they were being posted for our subcommittee meetings and also any minutes from both the regular school committee meetings and subcommittee meetings.

33
00:02:56,414 --> 00:03:00,775
So definitely would like to see those posted sooner than later.

34
00:03:00,795 --> 00:03:12,738
And in the interim, if we can think about how we can get this material to folks for the next meeting, if it's problematic getting it on the website between now and then, I'd like to think about options for doing that.

35
00:03:13,691 --> 00:03:15,995
so that you all have our previous meeting notes.

36
00:03:16,556 --> 00:03:20,684
The last time we met on specific to behavioral health was in

37
00:03:22,278 --> 00:03:25,361
well, actually, we did discussion in the previous meeting as well.

38
00:03:25,381 --> 00:03:32,267
But I'm going to let Stacey sort of I'm going to hand it over to you for a minute, Stacey, and let you do a little brush up with us if you'd like.

39
00:03:32,367 --> 00:03:34,349
And I'm happy to jump in as well, Stacey.

40
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:37,772
If you want to just again, start with the introduction.

41
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:39,594
I know you did just do that.

42
00:03:39,614 --> 00:03:44,258
But just sort of so folks know, you know, why we're turning to you specifically for the behavioral health piece.

43
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:45,479
That would be helpful.

44
00:03:46,095 --> 00:03:48,096
Sure, so again, I'm Stacey Shulman.

45
00:03:48,136 --> 00:03:49,977
I'm the Director of School Counseling and Behavioral Health.

46
00:03:50,717 --> 00:04:12,347
And in meetings previously, we had talked about focusing on trauma specifically for the school year based on the COVID-19 pandemic and what our students were facing, not only to support students and what we were doing in that vein, but also professional development for staff as well in a multifaceted way.

47
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:28,607
Some of the things that we've done so far is that we've trained our counseling staff in a program called CBITS, which is Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, which was actually just for fun facts, was designed after Katrina for the Louisiana school system.

48
00:04:29,288 --> 00:04:39,554
And so Cognitive Behavioral Therapy talks about how our thoughts influence our behavior and how our behavior also subsequently in reverse affects our thoughts.

49
00:04:40,705 --> 00:04:43,506
So if our body's feeling tense, we may feel like we're having anxiety.

50
00:04:43,586 --> 00:04:46,746
If we're having anxious thoughts, our bodies may feel tense.

51
00:04:46,906 --> 00:04:54,108
And so we are starting now to recruit students for groups based on CBITS.

52
00:04:54,128 --> 00:04:58,369
We've sent out referral forms to staff and we're forming those.

53
00:04:58,849 --> 00:05:10,192
We waited a little bit from the beginning of the year because we wanted to make sure students had time to sort of settle in and see if these feelings continued as the school year began, obviously with the typical supports they had.

54
00:05:11,317 --> 00:05:18,641
We also trained our faculty in trauma science and symptoms, as well as an intensive push on mindfulness.

55
00:05:19,302 --> 00:05:24,145
So we partnered with AIP, Alliance Inclusion Prevention.

56
00:05:25,045 --> 00:05:33,530
They're a nonprofit in Boston to provide us with some both synchronous live trainings in the spring, as well as some asynchronous trainings.

57
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:36,752
And then we also had some trauma training from Better Lessons.

58
00:05:39,366 --> 00:05:45,249
had our clinical counseling staff become certified child and adolescent anxiety specialists as well.

59
00:05:46,549 --> 00:05:55,473
So that's sort of the rundown of what we've done so far for our students and staff.

60
00:05:55,513 --> 00:06:04,857
We provided also some parent trainings asynchronously online for mental health for students and children, adolescents, and how to recognize signs and symptoms.

61
00:06:06,045 --> 00:06:06,646
if you're a child.

62
00:06:07,306 --> 00:06:09,387
Where was that training pushed out?

63
00:06:10,148 --> 00:06:13,350
That was at the very beginning of the year in a Google classroom for parents.

64
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:17,652
Certainly if people are looking for it, they're welcome to email me, I can send it to them.

65
00:06:18,392 --> 00:06:20,754
Did you have a lot of attendance for that?

66
00:06:21,454 --> 00:06:23,175
I think we had a good amount.

67
00:06:25,356 --> 00:06:26,837
Great.

68
00:06:26,997 --> 00:06:34,762
And so for folks who also may not recall in our last meeting, there was some conversation about what exactly

69
00:06:36,023 --> 00:06:40,384
does the, how are we going to be driving policy around these issues?

70
00:06:40,424 --> 00:06:40,884
Hi, Heather.

71
00:06:42,224 --> 00:06:43,785
Glad to see, hi, both Heathers.

72
00:06:43,805 --> 00:06:45,805
Hi, Heather McKinnon-Glennon and Heather Ruminapp.

73
00:06:45,825 --> 00:06:46,325
How are you?

74
00:06:46,365 --> 00:06:47,305
Glad to see you both here.

75
00:06:47,986 --> 00:06:48,966
And hi, Marissa.

76
00:06:50,306 --> 00:06:51,726
Folks did some interviews earlier.

77
00:06:51,766 --> 00:06:56,327
So if you guys want to interview, you know, Heather, if you want to go first, I mean, not interview, introduce.

78
00:06:56,407 --> 00:06:57,268
Heather, you want to go first?

79
00:06:57,508 --> 00:06:58,548
Introduce yourself, Heather McKinnon.

80
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:00,829
I'm Heather Rumenab.

81
00:07:01,169 --> 00:07:04,151
I am a sophomore and a senior at the high school.

82
00:07:04,171 --> 00:07:05,392
I'm a social worker.

83
00:07:05,752 --> 00:07:10,195
I focus in trauma treatment, and I'm just happy to be here.

84
00:07:10,215 --> 00:07:12,156
Nice to see you all.

85
00:07:12,176 --> 00:07:12,516
Nice to see you.

86
00:07:12,536 --> 00:07:13,117
Good to see you.

87
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:13,977
Heather McKinnon.

88
00:07:13,997 --> 00:07:14,057
Hi.

89
00:07:14,077 --> 00:07:16,999
I'm Heather McKinnon.

90
00:07:25,264 --> 00:07:27,406
I'm a mom of

91
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:34,524
We're not hearing you, Heather, for some reason you're coming in and out.

92
00:07:34,804 --> 00:07:36,887
I'll grab my mic and I'll speak later.

93
00:07:42,874 --> 00:07:43,454
Oh, sorry.

94
00:07:43,494 --> 00:07:43,715
Great.

95
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:44,696
Marissa, do you want to say hi?

96
00:07:44,716 --> 00:07:49,541
Hi, my name is Marissa Isbell.

97
00:07:50,732 --> 00:07:53,413
I have a son that goes to the Roberts.

98
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:54,934
He's in the connections program.

99
00:07:54,994 --> 00:07:55,895
He's on the spectrum.

100
00:07:55,915 --> 00:08:02,298
And then I have a daughter at an eighth grade at the McGlynn and a daughter in the fifth grade at the McGlynn.

101
00:08:11,423 --> 00:08:12,103
Mel, you're muted.

102
00:08:13,004 --> 00:08:14,024
I said, great, welcome.

103
00:08:14,325 --> 00:08:16,786
Sorry, I'm typing on another screen, so I didn't see my mute button.

104
00:08:18,015 --> 00:08:19,716
Welcome Marissa.

105
00:08:19,976 --> 00:08:30,824
I was just saying that also in our last meeting, we had members so I was talking explicitly about, you know, thinking about what the policy levers are that we're using to drive.

106
00:08:32,341 --> 00:08:36,083
specifically the subcommittee meetings for behavioral health and special education.

107
00:08:36,603 --> 00:08:57,092
So in other words, what are we thinking about in terms of school committees role in creating policy for the district with specific regard to trauma-informed schools, in this instance, behavioral health trauma-informed schools, which we identified as our topic for this year, our concern for this year.

108
00:08:57,672 --> 00:09:01,157
for behavioral health and as I said we'll get to special education shortly.

109
00:09:01,617 --> 00:09:13,993
So I'd like to have a little bit of a discussion maybe explicitly about what sort of policy ideas that might be out there for moving forward the topic of trauma informed schools and I know that

110
00:09:15,314 --> 00:09:23,983
Stacey, you talked about the training that's been happening in the schools, the mindfulness, the CBITS, the student involvement, student training, those sorts of things.

111
00:09:24,003 --> 00:09:31,931
And those are things that I believe you and your staff have sort of taken the initiative on and that you're keeping us apprised of and informed of.

112
00:09:32,452 --> 00:09:33,053
That's correct.

113
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:34,094
Yeah, go ahead.

114
00:09:36,068 --> 00:09:53,850
I think in terms of policy, one of the things that had come down from a state level in the last five years was there was a mandate for three hours every three years of mental health awareness as a suicide prevention model.

115
00:09:54,358 --> 00:09:59,661
However, that was never appropriated with funding for schools as it was meant to.

116
00:10:00,421 --> 00:10:14,768
So therefore there is no formal requirement for us to do so, but that may be something we could consider proposing to the school committee to add in to our Medford schools policies to mirror that.

117
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:22,072
So basically that was an unfunded mandate from DESE?

118
00:10:23,191 --> 00:10:23,571
Correct.

119
00:10:23,892 --> 00:10:28,036
Was it in response to some political background?

120
00:10:28,096 --> 00:10:29,298
I just I'm not familiar.

121
00:10:29,318 --> 00:10:29,878
I don't remember.

122
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:34,824
Was there something specifically that happened that usually there is that sort of?

123
00:10:35,565 --> 00:10:35,785
Yeah.

124
00:10:35,805 --> 00:10:37,987
So I think that this came around.

125
00:10:39,149 --> 00:10:42,773
I'm pretty sure it came around of one of the more severe school shootings.

126
00:10:44,099 --> 00:10:54,382
So they were looking for more preventative models because it was with a gun law that was around the same time.

127
00:10:55,232 --> 00:11:06,298
And it was in when suicides prevention specifically because the the perpetrator was that something that had happened in that instance, or I don't think okay, I don't remember specific.

128
00:11:06,318 --> 00:11:10,861
I'm just Yeah, I'm just trying to understand why it's specific to suicide prevention.

129
00:11:11,341 --> 00:11:13,822
That was one of the requirements that it had to include.

130
00:11:13,842 --> 00:11:14,363
Oh, okay.

131
00:11:15,143 --> 00:11:16,824
But it was one of the requirements.

132
00:11:17,704 --> 00:11:19,746
Yes, mental health, behavioral health overall.

133
00:11:20,206 --> 00:11:20,486
Okay.

134
00:11:21,683 --> 00:11:26,086
mental health, behavioral health awareness overall with a requirement for suicide prevention?

135
00:11:27,808 --> 00:11:28,648
That was the intent.

136
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:30,550
Okay.

137
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:35,213
So to be able to identify students who may need more behavioral health supports.

138
00:11:35,673 --> 00:11:36,054
I see.

139
00:11:36,354 --> 00:11:37,014
In your school.

140
00:11:37,835 --> 00:11:40,937
And did you do do you still or can you get us some

141
00:11:42,826 --> 00:11:45,829
resource information or record of that, I'd be curious to know.

142
00:11:46,209 --> 00:12:08,850
So again, when we're talking about sort of populating resources or what have you for us, this is, you know, I guess for both member Russo and Superintendent Edward Vincent, how can we be thinking about creating these subcommittee shared folders, I guess, with, you know, access for the community or the members of whoever is participating in the subcommittee?

143
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:38,617
And, you know, maybe it's that the chair is creating the subcommittee folders themselves on their own Google Drive, and then, you know, uploading them at the end of the year to the Google Drive that's not editable or accessible to outside members or what, but we need to be thinking about this so that, because there are lots of materials that I want to share with our subcommittee that I know that Stacey and Joan have access to, and that other members of our community, like Shanine Peliquin, just shared this great friendship.

144
00:12:39,637 --> 00:12:40,858
building resource with us.

145
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:44,141
And, you know, there's a number of resources that that would like to share.

146
00:12:44,181 --> 00:12:45,962
So I really do want to think about that.

147
00:12:46,042 --> 00:12:55,630
So but Stacey, if you want to share that, I guess, Desi mandate and anything that you have, you know, around that, that would be really helpful for us to have some background.

148
00:12:55,670 --> 00:13:07,099
So ultimately, what I'm thinking, we'd like to do, again, as the subcommittee and what we've done in past on other committees that in the past on other committees that I've been on, is we do this sort of

149
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:20,534
legwork, brainstorming, boots on the ground stuff in these meetings during the year that culminates in a presentation, if you will, to school committee with recommendations, policy recommendations moving forward.

150
00:13:20,574 --> 00:13:24,915
And hopefully they're acted on at that meeting, but that's generally sort of where I think we're going.

151
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:40,723
these meetings so sort of building our resources around this as we're preparing the presentation and can share those as part of the presentation so that you know folks have some background and some understanding.

152
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:48,471
So from what I'm hearing from you Stacey is that perhaps one of the policy levers we would use is thinking about funding this three hours every

153
00:13:49,865 --> 00:13:55,406
Well, it says every three years, but I suspect you're saying at least three hours once a year or not.

154
00:13:56,527 --> 00:14:02,648
It gets tricky in that way because we only have a set amount of time for professional development.

155
00:14:04,129 --> 00:14:16,932
So I think, you know, at a minimum, we should have two hours a year focused on mental health, which we have in the past, you know, five years, at least one in the fall and one in the spring.

156
00:14:18,313 --> 00:14:20,474
would be my suggestion.

157
00:14:22,135 --> 00:14:28,937
And the one hour time limit kind of helps so that we can use specific times throughout the year.

158
00:14:28,957 --> 00:14:31,638
Stacey?

159
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:33,299
Sorry, I'll go ahead.

160
00:14:33,319 --> 00:14:36,560
Member Rousseau?

161
00:14:37,121 --> 00:14:42,643
Are you saying that there's a certain number of hours every year that already are happening for every teacher?

162
00:14:43,778 --> 00:14:45,219
They're happening, they're offered.

163
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:49,481
So it could be an optional offering along with everything else.

164
00:14:50,762 --> 00:14:55,085
We do a lot of mental health awareness and principal meetings as well.

165
00:14:55,865 --> 00:15:03,910
I think that, you know, as a policy would help sort of firm up a requirement for staff that, you know, everyone to participate in it.

166
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:11,394
So, so do we have teachers that have never taken anything related to mental health that we've offered?

167
00:15:12,205 --> 00:15:14,806
Oh, I would be very surprised if that was the case.

168
00:15:15,607 --> 00:15:17,067
There's been so much offered.

169
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:18,488
I can't imagine that.

170
00:15:19,008 --> 00:15:20,349
OK, good.

171
00:15:20,369 --> 00:15:25,611
Because the word offered gets me uncomfortable.

172
00:15:25,631 --> 00:15:33,495
Sort of like looking optional, that will address racial equity, which is a different topic.

173
00:15:33,555 --> 00:15:35,316
But it can't be optional.

174
00:15:36,136 --> 00:15:39,978
We can't have teachers that are just deciding that, like, that's not my issue.

175
00:15:39,998 --> 00:15:40,518
I teach math.

176
00:15:41,546 --> 00:15:42,147
I agree.

177
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:46,934
So I guess going to mandatory gets complicated because

178
00:15:48,702 --> 00:15:51,104
mandatory every year for every teacher.

179
00:15:53,146 --> 00:16:07,156
If you're the first or second or third year in the district or as a teacher that perhaps isn't too much, but 15 years of the same mandatory training probably would be not a good use of anybody's time.

180
00:16:07,836 --> 00:16:11,399
So I just, I feel like there's gotta be something between mandatory and optional.

181
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,221
I don't know what that's called.

182
00:16:15,075 --> 00:16:22,982
I think under the behavioral health umbrella as a whole, there's so much, and it's a constantly changing climate and landscape.

183
00:16:23,522 --> 00:16:33,611
So what we feel like students need and what we feel like students are presenting with, that one to two hours a year, as a professional in Medford, you would not be receiving the same training every year.

184
00:16:34,171 --> 00:16:35,773
We would change it based on the needs.

185
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:58,095
And I'd like to hear from other community members or anyone who sort of wants to, you know, jump in about, I mean, again, as we're thinking specifically about policy, it's, you know, I'm sure there are folks thinking, and I'm sitting here thinking one to two hours a year on mental health awareness just doesn't feel like a lot, right?

186
00:16:58,235 --> 00:17:09,799
I mean, it doesn't feel like a very big policy shift, especially, you know, if they're already doing it, you know, so I get that it's, you know, important to sort of have that as a requirement

187
00:17:10,479 --> 00:17:26,873
and certainly stated as a value potentially for the school committee to do, but I guess I'm sort of thinking about what other folks are thinking regarding this specific topic, behavioral health and mental health awareness.

188
00:17:29,072 --> 00:17:55,305
Is there, could there be like some kind of webinar or something that maybe like staff could watch something not too long, especially right now with COVID going on and how stressed the kids are and how like different the situation is and what they're used to, like just to kind of give them a sense to, or give them a way to recognize, you know, abnormal behavior and,

189
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:59,161
just anxiety in the students.

190
00:17:59,281 --> 00:18:13,664
And I know I just, I worry about that because I think this period of time has really put a lot of like stress on the kids and there's not, you know, a lot of outlets for them right now.

191
00:18:13,684 --> 00:18:21,586
And I just, I wonder, you know, if we're missing things just because we're all so stressed right now.

192
00:18:23,995 --> 00:18:26,116
Yeah, Marissa, I think that's a really good point.

193
00:18:26,196 --> 00:18:35,281
I mean, I think that, you know, last year before COVID even, we were working on the on the Medford Community Media Show Ed Talk.

194
00:18:35,361 --> 00:18:37,462
And I'm working with a number of students on that show.

195
00:18:37,522 --> 00:18:42,545
And they were all, you know, wanting to do their next show was actually going to be about anxiety.

196
00:18:42,565 --> 00:18:44,866
And they were talking about how much they're dealing with anxiety.

197
00:18:44,886 --> 00:18:45,427
And this was even

198
00:18:46,275 --> 00:18:47,255
you know, pre COVID.

199
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:50,476
So I know that they're experiencing it even more.

200
00:18:50,516 --> 00:18:57,678
And I think being able to have that communal experience and help each other identify or recognize that would be really important.

201
00:18:57,718 --> 00:19:10,281
And again, I know that that's not policy specific, but I also feel like the purpose of these subcommittee meetings are very much to, you know, bounce these ideas around with each other and think about, you know, what we could be doing to help students in this area.

202
00:19:10,321 --> 00:19:11,941
So thank you, Heather.

203
00:19:13,671 --> 00:19:22,977
Um, I was, I guess I'm wondering too, is there a way to do an emergency type of, um, just requirement?

204
00:19:23,177 --> 00:19:32,723
And I know the teachers are under so much stress, but is even if the kids are going to be going, I know some of the kids are already in school, but, and maybe this has already been done.

205
00:19:33,343 --> 00:19:42,609
Um, but just having like having them do a virtual training or read some things about kind of acclimating back into school and

206
00:19:43,289 --> 00:19:46,831
kind of this emergency COVID situation.

207
00:19:46,991 --> 00:20:05,562
And I just feel like even if there was a grant as part of the emergency, you know, that it is, we're still in an emergency situation and it seems more urgent than anything else that's going on in the schools to support the kids' mental health and the teachers' mental health also.

208
00:20:05,582 --> 00:20:10,445
And just calling awareness, you know, with the administration,

209
00:20:12,233 --> 00:20:24,778
the awareness of how to support their staff, how to support themselves and self care, and then write down to the students so that, you know, it's just, it's even more important than school right now.

210
00:20:25,258 --> 00:20:38,263
Like three hours just seems, and at the same time I understand, I would rather have my kids spending an hour playing outside and they're in high school than an hour doing homework and just even,

211
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:48,757
even some training around that, that like we really have to focus on kids, just mental and physical wellness right now and teachers and administrators.

212
00:20:48,897 --> 00:21:05,389
And I just don't, I don't know how much has been done around that, but also a connection with resources in the community and people that people, parents, kids, and teachers can reach out to if they're having any of the struggles.

213
00:21:05,449 --> 00:21:07,210
So I don't know.

214
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:09,371
That's just some of the things I'm thinking about.

215
00:21:10,472 --> 00:21:10,933
Thanks, Heather.

216
00:21:10,973 --> 00:21:11,793
And what would that look like?

217
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:21,361
Are you talking about what Marissa was saying, like a webinar or an instructional video?

218
00:21:21,421 --> 00:21:23,283
What are you thinking that that actually looks like?

219
00:21:23,343 --> 00:21:23,863
I'm curious.

220
00:21:24,424 --> 00:21:26,345
Yeah, no, that's a really good point.

221
00:21:26,445 --> 00:21:35,953
I think a webinar obviously makes the most sense right now, just something that people can do even in an hour and maybe actual

222
00:21:37,032 --> 00:21:40,274
resources that everyone can, you know, like a Google doc.

223
00:21:40,334 --> 00:21:48,780
These are, you know, if you're seeing any of these signs, these are clinicians that you can contact or contact your guidance counselor and they'll refer you.

224
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,662
But I'm, I'm trying to like give the teachers less work.

225
00:21:52,403 --> 00:21:58,907
So if there's a way to do that, not pile more on the school, um,

226
00:22:00,928 --> 00:22:04,611
I know the other part of me is thinking about, as I'm thinking about, I think this is a great idea.

227
00:22:04,631 --> 00:22:07,793
And I think the students need it clearly so much.

228
00:22:07,853 --> 00:22:09,555
And I'm sure the teachers really do too.

229
00:22:09,615 --> 00:22:22,405
And I think I'm thinking to some of Stacey's mindfulness stuff that I think could be really engaging or even like yoga, sort of a communal yoga event or something like that, that could be engaging for staff and even for students.

230
00:22:23,526 --> 00:22:26,348
Because the other thing I think about with a webinar is I think,

231
00:22:26,796 --> 00:22:47,365
know with me today particularly as well I've been in front of the computer all day long and I know with my son you know I swear like you can almost see the smoke you know after him at 2 15 or 220 when the you know when the computer shut down he's out he's like gone you know at the soccer field he's like you know don't even talk to him essentially he's not

232
00:22:47,865 --> 00:23:03,938
And if I, he's even loathe to get on the computer to get his license right now right and he wants his license so I think that that's really tricky about like if we're going to have a webinar specific or even a video I guess unless it's a really engaging sort of

233
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:10,213
you know, maybe find YouTube piece or something like that that can help address some of the issues with the kids.

234
00:23:10,233 --> 00:23:11,514
I don't know how we're gonna get them.

235
00:23:12,035 --> 00:23:14,997
And I guess for that matter, maybe even the teachers back onto a screen.

236
00:23:15,898 --> 00:23:17,919
So I don't know, I'm just putting that out there too.

237
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:19,400
I'd like to hear what folks think.

238
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:21,142
Heather McKinnon, I know you had your hand up.

239
00:23:23,143 --> 00:23:34,392
So I am thinking just tangentially on that piece that maybe there's a way to do some sort of recreational

240
00:23:34,902 --> 00:23:41,163
hangout, um, like a, I'm not sure.

241
00:23:41,704 --> 00:24:00,548
This is, I'm just, this wasn't what I was, what I was really thinking on, but some sort of recreational hangout where kids can be outside and sort of like, I'm just envisioning like those, those cameras where they, you know, they, they can, um,

242
00:24:02,417 --> 00:24:06,978
sort of photograph what they're doing, but do it together, you know?

243
00:24:06,998 --> 00:24:09,238
But that's an aside.

244
00:24:09,899 --> 00:24:13,919
And now I'm gonna take it from fun to like, whoa.

245
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:26,822
But I do think that three hours every three years is like really ridiculously underserving mental health.

246
00:24:29,603 --> 00:24:30,603
I'm thinking about like,

247
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:59,164
our community members who are probably stuck at home and in domestic violence situations, and in situations that they're not talking about, that they're now trapped at home, and our students who are stuck in situations that they can't talk about, that they can't, I mean, and that they can't get out of,

248
00:25:01,088 --> 00:25:03,150
and logging into a computer every day.

249
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:06,212
I'm scared for these students.

250
00:25:07,593 --> 00:25:13,697
I apologize, I've got a very lively five-year-old here.

251
00:25:14,598 --> 00:25:19,101
But I am scared for those students.

252
00:25:19,862 --> 00:25:27,408
Former colleagues of mine, I've heard from union reps that

253
00:25:28,432 --> 00:25:40,900
They're making accommodations for for former colleagues of mine to go back into the office So that they can get away from certain circumstances at home What are we doing to serve these?

254
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:51,807
students, you know I'm I'm worried because people I am a I'm a survivor myself and I am concerned about

255
00:25:52,720 --> 00:26:00,604
things that we don't talk about, because I didn't talk about that for seven years of it going on in my life.

256
00:26:01,565 --> 00:26:09,269
So I think it's a really, really, really touchy situation to have.

257
00:26:14,423 --> 00:26:20,509
He's really funny in light of this serious topic But I I'm worried about our kids.

258
00:26:20,569 --> 00:26:22,590
I'm worried about our our parents.

259
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:23,951
I'm worried about families.

260
00:26:24,072 --> 00:26:30,337
I'm worried about our community Because this is like a pressure cooker that we're in right now.

261
00:26:30,357 --> 00:26:30,377
I

262
00:26:31,143 --> 00:26:33,645
and how do we help people?

263
00:26:34,225 --> 00:26:38,167
And I think three hours every three years is bananas.

264
00:26:38,647 --> 00:26:42,129
I'm just gonna say that's bananas.

265
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:45,211
And mandatory, absolutely.

266
00:26:45,511 --> 00:26:51,475
It should be mandatory because there's so much under that umbrella, for sure.

267
00:26:52,455 --> 00:26:53,196
Absolutely.

268
00:26:53,972 --> 00:26:55,614
So that was my piece.

269
00:26:55,974 --> 00:26:56,555
Oh, that's great.

270
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:56,936
Thank you.

271
00:26:56,976 --> 00:26:57,737
That's really helpful.

272
00:26:58,137 --> 00:27:01,661
I know this is what keeps me one of the things that keeps me up at night as well.

273
00:27:02,983 --> 00:27:06,887
I do know, interestingly, and I'm sure Dr. Cushing can speak to this as well.

274
00:27:07,769 --> 00:27:21,479
Senior mentioned to me this morning, although he was, you know, we were just sort of passing in the hallway briefly that that there's going to be this, you know, drive in or or experience that they've set up for the senior classes sort of this communal experience.

275
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:24,141
I haven't seen the email about it myself yet.

276
00:27:24,821 --> 00:27:26,202
He was frankly disappointed.

277
00:27:26,443 --> 00:27:28,304
Dr. Cushing, I don't know if you're aware of this, but

278
00:27:28,795 --> 00:27:36,497
He was disappointed that, I don't know, they were saying that the students cannot be in cars unless it's with their direct family members.

279
00:27:36,517 --> 00:27:41,819
So he's like, I mean, he's got this bubble, like his girlfriend is in our bubble.

280
00:27:42,759 --> 00:27:45,560
So he was like, why would I wanna go to the drive-in movies with my...

281
00:27:46,973 --> 00:27:48,273
my parents, right?

282
00:27:48,413 --> 00:27:50,734
And I'm like, I get it, buddy.

283
00:27:51,034 --> 00:27:52,514
He's like, what does that do for us?

284
00:27:52,534 --> 00:27:54,174
That doesn't do anything for them.

285
00:27:54,654 --> 00:27:58,615
And in fact, he feels like it's more insulting than anything.

286
00:27:58,675 --> 00:27:59,695
And I kind of agree.

287
00:28:00,315 --> 00:28:11,837
And so the other piece that I think is really, really, really important is that we're not checking in with the kids to see what it is they want and what it is they need and how they're handling.

288
00:28:11,877 --> 00:28:14,298
And that was one of the best experiences that I've had

289
00:28:15,769 --> 00:28:33,227
doing the Ed Talk show and Medford Community Media was getting the opportunity to spend some time with some, you know, juniors, 17, 18 year olds, 16, 17, 18 year olds that were not my own children, just sort of in a general, in a more general way, and I'll never forget we were doing a show on vaping, right, and they were talking about

290
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:38,481
you know, we had several guests on that were talking about, you know, the dangers of vaping or whatever.

291
00:28:38,641 --> 00:28:49,330
And I was just so moved by one of the young men there who was a student and talking about like, when I said, well, what would you wanna say to parents or something to that degree?

292
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:56,896
And he said, well, I just wanna tell you that if you do find that you're, if you don't think that your child is vaping, you're wrong, right?

293
00:28:56,916 --> 00:28:58,298
Because most of them are.

294
00:28:58,318 --> 00:29:02,001
And he said, and if you do find that your child is vaping,

295
00:29:02,561 --> 00:29:10,767
that, you know, basically don't take it personally, don't make it about you, don't think that it's some failure of yours, right?

296
00:29:11,228 --> 00:29:18,373
Don't make it, you know, don't sort of catastrophize it, but more so like talk to the student and listen to them.

297
00:29:18,955 --> 00:29:19,215
right?

298
00:29:19,355 --> 00:29:21,836
About what's going on and what they, and, and I thought about that.

299
00:29:21,856 --> 00:29:30,678
Cause I thought, I remember back in middle school when my, my kids who are now ones, a sophomore in college and one's a senior in high school, but back in middle school, they would come home.

300
00:29:30,858 --> 00:29:35,779
I swear to God, they came home for like at least a good month, every single day telling me about vaping.

301
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:39,680
And they would be like, Oh my mom, you know, there's this thing vaping and it, you know, blah, blah, blah.

302
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:40,420
And they would tell me about it.

303
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,000
And I would just sort of be like, Oh really?

304
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:42,761
Thank you.

305
00:29:42,801 --> 00:29:43,741
No, that's interesting.

306
00:29:44,141 --> 00:29:48,402
But I never really explored it with them more because I just automatically assume like, well, they're not doing it.

307
00:29:48,442 --> 00:29:48,782
Cause they're,

308
00:29:49,082 --> 00:29:50,503
Number one, they're telling me about it.

309
00:29:50,523 --> 00:29:53,505
And number two, it sounds horrible and blah, blah, blah.

310
00:29:53,806 --> 00:29:56,507
But I wasn't exploring it more with them and listening to them.

311
00:29:56,547 --> 00:30:10,718
And I think that that's one of the biggest issues that I'm seeing with the mental health staff or that I feel like with the mental health staff, even in our own home, is that we're not checking in with the kids to see what it is they want, what it is is going to help them in this situation right now.

312
00:30:11,318 --> 00:30:18,340
You know, I think we have these family surveys that we're doing across the district or that we've done across the district for data collection, right?

313
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,540
But we're not doing it with the students at all.

314
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:24,841
And they're so, they're so, they're so techno-friendly.

315
00:30:24,881 --> 00:30:32,663
Like we could probably get out, you know, a Google, a survey monkey to them or something, you know, whatever to them and their platform.

316
00:30:32,723 --> 00:30:35,324
And we'd probably have more responses than we've ever gotten from parents.

317
00:30:36,164 --> 00:30:38,605
because they're so, you know, prone to that.

318
00:30:38,645 --> 00:30:52,191
So I sort of think about that a little bit too, like even like a texted survey monkey or something where they could let us know what it is they really want for mental health support and what it is they really need around behavioral health and mental health support.

319
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:57,153
So yeah, that's just sort of my ruminating.

320
00:31:00,335 --> 00:31:00,715
Lisa?

321
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:05,792
Hi, Heather brought up a good point.

322
00:31:05,892 --> 00:31:10,775
It just happened to roll with what we had today, which I know, Melanie, you had wanted to attend.

323
00:31:10,975 --> 00:31:18,920
The district attorney was here and spoke with our early childhood, our health assisting and our cosmetology students.

324
00:31:19,221 --> 00:31:25,705
And I'll tell you, I don't know if it was almost better being on Zoom because all of the students really had a lot to say about

325
00:31:29,147 --> 00:31:46,542
Maybe how to approach domestic violence, and I know the district attorney even said that there were measures that they had changed up due to call it so that people could reach out for help.

326
00:31:47,844 --> 00:32:00,956
say via texting even because most people had been working from home and so it would look inconspicuous and nobody would realize, you know, potentially that they were asking for help.

327
00:32:01,016 --> 00:32:06,381
But I really, really loved the fact that the students really, really participated.

328
00:32:06,401 --> 00:32:09,944
And again, I don't know if it was, excuse me, the Zoom, because we have had this.

329
00:32:11,405 --> 00:32:18,108
two years in a row, the district attorneys come to the health assisting classes.

330
00:32:19,709 --> 00:32:29,393
But the students who really are all sophomores, and I will say they had a lot to say, they asked questions, they had a lot of good comments.

331
00:32:31,174 --> 00:32:37,697
So again, although it was Zoom, I found it really a great learning process for all of us.

332
00:32:38,197 --> 00:32:44,261
So it was really, to me, they are thinking about this stuff and they do have questions.

333
00:32:45,081 --> 00:32:48,123
And I was glad that they didn't hesitate to ask.

334
00:32:49,438 --> 00:32:52,661
Respond was on the call as well and portal to hope.

335
00:32:53,142 --> 00:33:02,270
So they also made brief presentations and the kids had questions for them too so it went, I thought very well, but I just wanted to share that with the committee since Heather had brought it up.

336
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:03,250
Thank you.

337
00:33:05,813 --> 00:33:07,254
Do you know if that was recorded?

338
00:33:07,274 --> 00:33:09,495
I know, I wanted to go, I wasn't able to go today.

339
00:33:09,736 --> 00:33:13,479
No, it was considered like a class, so we recorded it.

340
00:33:16,321 --> 00:33:18,122
And was that pushed out, was that?

341
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:21,885
They wanted to do it by Zoom, I guess, so we were like the test patient.

342
00:33:22,446 --> 00:33:25,048
And I think they were very pleased on all sides.

343
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:32,314
I mean, Dr. Cushing was on the call as well, so I'm sure that he thought it was wonderful because the students really participated.

344
00:33:33,619 --> 00:33:35,481
So it was really like a class.

345
00:33:36,483 --> 00:33:39,426
It wasn't a community activity.

346
00:33:39,446 --> 00:33:40,628
It was during class time.

347
00:33:40,668 --> 00:33:42,270
Yes, it was their class time.

348
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:49,099
So that's the other consideration, really, as we're thinking about this, right, when we're talking about what the students want or whatever else.

349
00:33:49,159 --> 00:33:52,463
And again, maybe bringing it back to the policy piece, too, is that

350
00:33:52,995 --> 00:34:06,881
you know, if these were occurring or if something like this, the webinar, whether it be that idea or the video observation, video, or even like the assemblies that we normally have in regular people time, right?

351
00:34:07,842 --> 00:34:09,903
That maybe it's something that can be happening.

352
00:34:10,223 --> 00:34:19,747
I'm focused on the student, excuse me, the students particularly right now, but maybe it's something that could be happening during the school day where there's something similar to

353
00:34:20,421 --> 00:34:46,138
what Lisa was talking about with the district attorney's training specific around domestic violence, but a specific mental health event, Stacey, behavioral health, mental health event that takes place similar to what one would think of that normally would happen in an all-school auditorium, but that in this format would be during school, maybe in a Zoom session or something similar.

354
00:34:47,725 --> 00:34:49,145
Yeah, thank you for bringing that up.

355
00:34:49,345 --> 00:34:53,707
So just for the students perspective, two things I wanted to mention.

356
00:34:53,967 --> 00:35:01,569
One was today during the high school advisory, we had students fill out a survey about homework and homework stress.

357
00:35:02,629 --> 00:35:11,131
And the reason why we did it during advisory is because students received so many emails that they're reporting to us like things are falling through the cracks.

358
00:35:11,531 --> 00:35:25,820
So they're so tech savvy and they're really, you know, wanting to share this information, but we wanted them to have that dedicated time and also to have a staff member available if they were like, I don't know exactly how to answer this question to help work with them.

359
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:30,683
So we got a huge number of responses, of course, from that, and we'll be analyzing that data.

360
00:35:31,523 --> 00:35:38,126
We surveyed the faculty as well to say how our students are reporting specifically stress from homework related.

361
00:35:38,607 --> 00:35:49,752
We also provided students with an over, sorry, faculty with a flow sheet for identifying students who may need counseling support and a referral form to send to counselors.

362
00:35:50,213 --> 00:35:52,874
We created a 60 page community resource book

363
00:35:53,535 --> 00:35:58,500
That also went out to help so hopefully we'll be figuring out a way to put that online, too.

364
00:35:59,341 --> 00:36:11,235
And then in terms of an assembly mental health format, we have the NAN project, which is a subsidiary of Elliott Community Health, and they're going to be coming in and doing a three part series on mental health.

365
00:36:12,216 --> 00:36:15,258
And they're going to be working with grade by grade.

366
00:36:16,179 --> 00:36:18,500
So we have had NAN project in previously.

367
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:22,923
They're a mental health awareness agency that is provided free of cost to Medford.

368
00:36:22,963 --> 00:36:23,484
We love them.

369
00:36:24,667 --> 00:36:29,068
and they have peer mentors come in and speak about their mental health experience.

370
00:36:29,528 --> 00:36:33,389
But the most important part about it to me is that they talk about recovery.

371
00:36:33,909 --> 00:36:41,830
So 95% of people who have challenges with mental illness do recover over time with good support.

372
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:49,232
So they really talk about the struggles they had, who they reached out, what was helpful, and where they are now in their life.

373
00:36:49,472 --> 00:36:51,692
So they're going to be doing a three-part series

374
00:36:52,352 --> 00:37:06,007
In small groups with students were starting with the senior class because I felt like that that was a good place to start and will be working all the grades from 12 down to six throughout this year in these small.

375
00:37:06,882 --> 00:37:14,084
segments with the NAN project, and that's all related to mental health and faculty are obviously able to join as well.

376
00:37:14,144 --> 00:37:31,410
And I think it's really helpful for them, faculty, to hear about those who have struggled, you know, in their high school, college days with mental health challenges and what that looked like for them at the time, what felt helpful, what was helpful, and some things that weren't helpful.

377
00:37:31,894 --> 00:37:34,576
either they talk about too for approaching people.

378
00:37:34,596 --> 00:37:39,720
So those are some of the things that we have going on that I felt would be helpful based on the comments folks are making.

379
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:41,141
Yeah, that is helpful.

380
00:37:41,161 --> 00:37:43,582
Are you spelling it M-A-N-N project?

381
00:37:45,123 --> 00:37:45,784
N-A-N.

382
00:37:46,885 --> 00:37:49,126
N-A-N, NAN project, okay.

383
00:37:49,326 --> 00:37:55,010
So I believe the founder's sister's name was Nancy and they called her Nan and she died by suicide.

384
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:58,673
So they created this foundation in her name.

385
00:37:59,198 --> 00:38:04,860
Okay, so if we wanna look up information about that, we can just Google the NAN project, is that right?

386
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:05,440
Yes.

387
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:11,982
And that's starting, you said it's a three-part series in small groups with students starting with the senior class?

388
00:38:12,382 --> 00:38:12,922
That's correct.

389
00:38:13,022 --> 00:38:14,762
That all students in the senior class?

390
00:38:15,243 --> 00:38:17,523
That's correct, yes, during that advisory window.

391
00:38:18,704 --> 00:38:22,945
And they're gonna be working with them during that time and also staying on after.

392
00:38:23,705 --> 00:38:33,674
So if students feel like they have more questions or concerns after the information presentation giving, the NAN project will remain on for follow-up care and also refer to counselors if needed.

393
00:38:34,274 --> 00:38:34,755
That's great.

394
00:38:34,835 --> 00:38:41,580
And can you share, Stacey, with us, can you share with us the data from the stress from homework?

395
00:38:42,181 --> 00:38:44,343
I don't have it yet, so we just- No, I know, when you do.

396
00:38:44,543 --> 00:38:45,444
Yeah, when you can have it.

397
00:38:45,464 --> 00:38:45,744
Yeah, yeah.

398
00:38:45,784 --> 00:38:46,084
Certainly.

399
00:38:48,022 --> 00:38:48,642
That would be great.

400
00:38:48,722 --> 00:38:49,743
That would be very helpful.

401
00:38:50,883 --> 00:38:59,205
So we've got just we're at 545 marker for the behavioral health, but I just want to sort of wrap it up for a moment.

402
00:39:00,145 --> 00:39:13,929
I was taking some notes during this time, so some of the things that we've talked about clearly are, you know, some training, whether it's webinar based or other video based, but also some survey around what students want.

403
00:39:14,309 --> 00:39:16,130
Some of that has been happening as we can

404
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:30,299
Stacey, and again, some of the many of these things happen, as you can see on the subcommittee independent of school committee right it's not like school committee has to create a policy for these things to happen, they happen.

405
00:39:31,528 --> 00:39:40,475
And it's really great to be informed of them and to sort of be aware of them, both as school committee members, but as community members, which is another reason that I really feel like we do have this subcommittee.

406
00:39:41,856 --> 00:39:55,326
And, you know, we can continue to be thinking about what policy aspects as we continue this conversation will drive the presentation, which I think we'll schedule probably for May.

407
00:39:55,366 --> 00:39:57,568
I know that's our budget heavy time as well, but,

408
00:39:58,737 --> 00:40:05,201
We can talk more about that, how we wanna do this presentation and how we're scheduling our recommendations for policy.

409
00:40:06,101 --> 00:40:10,603
So I'm gonna ask everybody to sort of maybe take a deep breath for a moment, just close your eyes.

410
00:40:11,544 --> 00:40:28,053
We're gonna switch our mindset here, because we have this sort of dueling actually agenda of these two topics, behavioral health and special education.

411
00:40:29,327 --> 00:40:41,517
And as again, we've said before, behavioral health, we're really focusing on trauma informed schools and looking at what our community is going through currently and how we can support our students, teachers and staff.

412
00:40:42,157 --> 00:40:46,881
And then for the special education component, we have identified

413
00:40:47,786 --> 00:40:52,128
the need for building community and school-based friendships.

414
00:40:52,368 --> 00:41:02,793
And part of the reason that that was identified, the genesis sort of of this committee was the special education subcommittee was created last year.

415
00:41:02,813 --> 00:41:06,614
I think it was a full year last year, or maybe it was a year and a half.

416
00:41:06,974 --> 00:41:08,075
Yeah, I think it was a year and a half.

417
00:41:08,615 --> 00:41:17,299
So not with Erin DiBenedetto from the school committee created the special education subcommittee as a result of recommendations from the Medford CPAC

418
00:41:17,797 --> 00:41:29,468
special education parent advisory council around issues and concerns that they had and wanting to be able to have some closer connection with school committee to address those issues and concerns.

419
00:41:30,649 --> 00:41:41,819
CPAC put out a survey last year as they do generally every year for a report that they also do to the school committee or present to the school committee at the end of the year with recommendations.

420
00:41:42,959 --> 00:41:45,901
One of the recommendations previously was that this subcommittee be started.

421
00:41:46,621 --> 00:41:48,382
So thank you to Medford CPAC for that.

422
00:41:49,082 --> 00:41:59,868
And in the most recent iteration of the survey of our parents of students with disabilities, probably the biggest component

423
00:42:00,808 --> 00:42:10,075
that we found that they wanted to talk about, to ask about, to foster was building friendships in community and building connections to each other.

424
00:42:10,095 --> 00:42:24,164
I think that we're all feeling isolated during these COVID times, but I think that, and I think that parents of children with disabilities have a unique isolation and certainly experienced that long before COVID.

425
00:42:24,758 --> 00:42:34,987
and have always tried to work to find their place in the community and to figure out how they could involve both their children and themselves more when they're already feeling marginalized.

426
00:42:35,007 --> 00:42:39,690
So in a way, I feel like we sort of have a little bit of expertise on sort of some of this.

427
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:46,896
And in another way, you know, you deal with double the isolation in these sort of situations as well.

428
00:42:47,357 --> 00:42:50,199
And so I think it has even more, we have even more need for building

429
00:42:51,115 --> 00:42:54,357
community relationships and friendships for our more marginalized students.

430
00:42:55,818 --> 00:43:08,667
And so with that, I am going to turn it over to Joan for a moment, if you don't mind, Joan or Charlotte, to talk a little bit about what we've been discussing, and maybe some aspects of policy that we can consider.

431
00:43:09,287 --> 00:43:12,729
I also want to let folks know that we got a really great email from

432
00:43:14,203 --> 00:43:29,426
Sheneen Peliquin, who was formerly recreation with the EMARC, which is now Communitas, which is the local DDS-funded organization for parents of children with disabilities.

433
00:43:29,846 --> 00:43:32,927
And Sheneen specializes in recreation and friendship building.

434
00:43:32,967 --> 00:43:40,328
And she sent us an attachment from the Arc of Mass, where I used to work, actually, that was a project based on building friendships that we can look at

435
00:43:40,883 --> 00:43:41,624
as we're moving forward.

436
00:43:41,644 --> 00:43:46,127
I'm sure folks didn't have time to look at it in the short time that we had received it.

437
00:43:46,687 --> 00:43:50,490
I'll make sure that central administration also has a copy of it.

438
00:43:51,191 --> 00:44:02,139
It's a really great project that the ARC put together about how to build friendships for students with disabilities in schools and in communities, and adults, frankly, as well.

439
00:44:02,179 --> 00:44:04,961
This is Charlotte.

440
00:44:05,341 --> 00:44:07,483
I did have a chance to just graze through it,

441
00:44:08,259 --> 00:44:17,324
And it's a fabulous document, the Friendship Toolkit, the way it breaks down the components of friendship, looks at the developmental levels.

442
00:44:17,404 --> 00:44:20,286
It's about one of the best resources I've seen.

443
00:44:20,987 --> 00:44:37,116
So I think it'd be a great guide for professional development of some sort, or just as a document for our staff to read, and also for paraprofessionals to read too, because often they are the folks that are right

444
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:38,543
close to the student.

445
00:44:40,624 --> 00:44:56,892
One thing that stood out for me in that document was reducing adult proximity because often we are all helping people and there's too many adults close by, so we need to fade back.

446
00:44:57,770 --> 00:44:59,712
So anyway, thank you for sharing that.

447
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:00,552
Yeah, no, 100%.

448
00:45:00,752 --> 00:45:09,339
And it was done by both folks out on the South Shore, but also Dr. Zach Rossetti at Boston University.

449
00:45:09,419 --> 00:45:14,584
And I've done a lot of presentations with Zach, and he's a great presenter, and he's also a sibling.

450
00:45:15,845 --> 00:45:19,808
Actually, his brother passed away this past year, but he was an adult.

451
00:45:20,148 --> 00:45:23,691
His brother was an adult, and they had a long sibling relationship, and it has driven

452
00:45:24,222 --> 00:45:28,966
a lot of Zach's study and research around disability and friendships and awareness.

453
00:45:28,986 --> 00:45:36,092
So I know that Zach would certainly be able and willing and interested in presenting for PD as well.

454
00:45:36,873 --> 00:45:39,595
He's a great presenter, so that could be something that we could be thinking of.

455
00:45:40,576 --> 00:45:46,802
And I couldn't agree more with the paraprofessional piece of it, especially as the children get to the middle school level and even at the fifth grade level.

456
00:45:47,382 --> 00:45:54,506
You know, even I remember with my typically developing daughter having that we, we hosted the Girl Scout dance, we did an 80s dance back in the day.

457
00:45:54,566 --> 00:45:56,927
And, you know, it had been a lot of fun.

458
00:45:56,967 --> 00:46:01,609
And just, you know, probably months earlier, she would have been happy to dance with me on the dance floor with all of her friends.

459
00:46:02,089 --> 00:46:07,392
That night, I learned a hard lesson as I was trying as I was dressed as Madonna trying to dance with them.

460
00:46:09,493 --> 00:46:11,914
that I was not welcome in that situation.

461
00:46:13,014 --> 00:46:24,499
And, you know, a lot of times with our students with, you know, disabilities and explicitly in our students with intellectual and developmental disabilities, they aren't always able to tell me that, tell us that, right?

462
00:46:24,919 --> 00:46:27,880
So my daughter, my fifth grade typical daughter didn't actually tell me either.

463
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:30,401
They just sort of all gave me the cold shoulder and walked away.

464
00:46:32,710 --> 00:46:37,972
But my child with the intellectual and developmental disability might not even be able to say that.

465
00:46:37,992 --> 00:46:43,613
And just even recently she was telling me that my voice was annoying and to stop talking.

466
00:46:44,434 --> 00:46:46,994
So she was able to say it in those instances.

467
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:48,595
But I think that you're right.

468
00:46:50,995 --> 00:46:55,777
No fifth grader, middle schooler, high schooler wants the adults around at this stage.

469
00:46:56,637 --> 00:47:03,662
So when kids are trying to develop friendships, and it's tricky because, you know, for our kids too, sometimes we have to facilitate the conversation, right?

470
00:47:03,722 --> 00:47:07,945
Like, especially the reciprocal conversation, right?

471
00:47:08,005 --> 00:47:18,153
So, you know, if somebody's asking you a question and you're just sort of sitting there not responding or trying to process or whatever, it's the prompting to say, you can ask that, you know, and thinking about how to fade that back.

472
00:47:18,173 --> 00:47:22,596
So I think that that's a really tricky, tricky piece, but I did like the book as well.

473
00:47:22,656 --> 00:47:25,258
Tanya, you were talking about some things that you really liked about the book,

474
00:47:26,398 --> 00:47:26,979
share a little bit?

475
00:47:26,999 --> 00:47:28,921
Yeah, I actually, thanks, Mel.

476
00:47:29,701 --> 00:47:38,789
I actually did have a chance to read through it, which was, and I was as impressed as Charlotte was on the whole thing.

477
00:47:39,629 --> 00:47:50,078
The one thing that I thought was really kind of neat was in, they talked about building friendships, it can't just be, you can't stop at inclusion.

478
00:47:50,979 --> 00:47:53,661
So once the child is included,

479
00:47:55,267 --> 00:47:59,408
that a lot of people think that's where it stops, that's inclusion, but that's not where it stops.

480
00:47:59,488 --> 00:48:03,270
Then you have to do the, you know, friendship building and things like that.

481
00:48:03,310 --> 00:48:12,132
And I just thought that that was really, it was really great because if you're just doing the inclusion, it kind of ends up being more of a mascoting situation.

482
00:48:13,253 --> 00:48:16,914
And we don't, definitely don't want that.

483
00:48:16,974 --> 00:48:19,875
We want real, you know, friendships for our kids.

484
00:48:19,915 --> 00:48:23,916
But I also thought, and Charlotte, I don't know if you saw this, there was a quote

485
00:48:25,095 --> 00:48:40,738
from a student with autism and it was really, you guys will all see it when you look over the document, but it basically talked about the adults being like a hidden tiger.

486
00:48:40,858 --> 00:48:50,620
So in other words, adults can be present with the kids with disabilities, but they need to step back, but they need to also from that stepped back position facilitate.

487
00:48:51,925 --> 00:49:00,269
and provide the supports that are necessary in order for that friendship to happen without looking like they're facilitating anything.

488
00:49:01,189 --> 00:49:05,251
It was just, it was really, it really stuck a chord with me.

489
00:49:05,371 --> 00:49:06,471
I could just add to that.

490
00:49:06,531 --> 00:49:17,916
That takes a great deal of training and confidence in a professional or a paraprofessional, because sometimes you do look like you're not doing anything, but that's the appropriate level of support at that moment.

491
00:49:20,204 --> 00:49:36,253
So, and, and when the less the training, the more the helpfulness, it's like the para that's got really great art skills that's in art class with the student that winds up doing it for as opposed to allowing for some risk.

492
00:49:38,973 --> 00:49:39,273
Right.

493
00:49:39,333 --> 00:49:47,540
And we have stories, I think that's in a book that I've seen too, those stories where the parent, you know, sent a note back in to thank the parent for the drawing, right?

494
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:49,902
Because it was very clear that the child hadn't done the drawing.

495
00:49:50,002 --> 00:49:52,645
It was, you know, a really well done and it was nice.

496
00:49:52,705 --> 00:49:56,007
I mean, they would, they would sort of, you know, this joking around with it, but it's true.

497
00:49:56,087 --> 00:49:59,610
It's sort of the wanting that line between the helpfulness, but also I think

498
00:50:00,331 --> 00:50:08,754
Tanya, as you were saying, you know, mentioning the authentic friendships too, it's like one of those things where, you know, we've had a number of friendships in school.

499
00:50:10,275 --> 00:50:17,758
And, you know, they've been really great friends and, you know, really felt genuine in terms of the friendship.

500
00:50:18,333 --> 00:50:26,577
But then the reality was, were we really getting phone calls to come over to the house for a play date?

501
00:50:26,677 --> 00:50:29,718
Or were we really getting the invitations to the birthday party?

502
00:50:30,298 --> 00:50:44,165
And if you're not, just in the adult relationships that we've had, or frankly, even in the school, the younger relationships we've had in our own life, if the relationship is one way, then is it really an authentic friendship?

503
00:50:45,205 --> 00:50:47,286
You really want to expound upon the common ground

504
00:50:48,475 --> 00:50:55,281
program too that Carla has because that program, it kind of, so I'll give you an example.

505
00:50:55,301 --> 00:50:58,484
They were Common Ground.

506
00:50:59,485 --> 00:51:08,432
My son was on a call with Common Ground this week and they were doing team building games.

507
00:51:09,208 --> 00:51:11,851
they probably didn't realize that's what they were, but that's what they were.

508
00:51:11,871 --> 00:51:15,836
And it was really, it was really very cool.

509
00:51:15,956 --> 00:51:20,541
And, and, you know, they were speaking to the kids just as peers.

510
00:51:21,182 --> 00:51:23,885
It wasn't, it wasn't in a mascotting way.

511
00:51:24,065 --> 00:51:26,288
It was, it wasn't in a, Oh, you're, you know,

512
00:51:26,860 --> 00:51:34,543
a little child, you know, when you're not, it was, it was just in a very real peer to peer manner.

513
00:51:34,843 --> 00:51:37,404
And it was, it was just really, it was really neat.

514
00:51:37,485 --> 00:51:42,207
And they do actually, they do come to the birthday parties.

515
00:51:43,667 --> 00:51:47,909
So a lot of the kids in the common ground have, will attend, you know, have attended birthday parties.

516
00:51:48,769 --> 00:51:53,371
The kids have gone to, you know, basketball games together back when life was normal.

517
00:51:55,621 --> 00:52:03,127
I'm not sure what that would look like now, but that program to me is a microcosm of what we need to make a macro of.

518
00:52:04,228 --> 00:52:13,275
Yeah, and that's exactly, I'm missing Carla in this conversation right now, but that's exactly some of the things that Carla has been talking about in these previous meetings.

519
00:52:13,335 --> 00:52:23,243
And so again, getting to the policy piece of it, it is what does that actually translate into in terms of school committee driving some policy around that?

520
00:52:24,657 --> 00:52:47,955
you know, we are, you know, supporting and, you know, and provide and either looking for grant money or providing funding to help create similar programs, you know, at the two middle schools and the high school to ensure that, you know, that's the first step in building, you know, specifically and focused on building friendships in our communities.

521
00:52:47,995 --> 00:52:53,159
So that might be one piece that we're looking at, like using the model that already exists at the high school.

522
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:53,900
Marissa?

523
00:52:55,119 --> 00:53:07,187
So my son has a new ABA company, kind of new, about three months, and his behavioral therapist, we were just chatting this week, and she's younger.

524
00:53:07,307 --> 00:53:22,836
She recently graduated from college, but she was telling me that when she was in high school, she was the president of her school's Best Buddies chapter, and that actually kind of got her interested in ABA therapy and being a therapist.

525
00:53:24,305 --> 00:53:43,756
We just chatted briefly, but I think she could be a real valuable resource, especially to as far as like building friendships, you know, with between, you know, kids with disabilities and, you know, typical kids and then also like, how would you run a program, you know, the things that they did, could we do that here too?

526
00:53:45,295 --> 00:53:45,955
Yeah, that'd be great.

527
00:53:45,975 --> 00:53:49,338
Would you invite her to the next subcommittee meeting?

528
00:53:49,618 --> 00:53:50,498
Sure, I can.

529
00:53:50,899 --> 00:53:51,939
Yeah, that'd be great, Marissa.

530
00:53:51,959 --> 00:53:53,140
That would really be great.

531
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:57,643
Heather, are there any updates on the best buddies conversation?

532
00:53:57,663 --> 00:54:05,788
I apologize that I haven't actually gotten to reach out to my contacts there.

533
00:54:07,049 --> 00:54:10,291
I will do that as soon as we get offline here.

534
00:54:12,092 --> 00:54:13,813
My life has been a little bit,

535
00:54:14,870 --> 00:54:18,872
crazy, as you will join the club, right?

536
00:54:18,972 --> 00:54:22,914
I think crazy is the the word.

537
00:54:23,294 --> 00:54:24,374
I'm gonna I'm gonna try.

538
00:54:28,156 --> 00:54:28,916
I'm packing.

539
00:54:28,936 --> 00:54:32,758
You moved.

540
00:54:33,719 --> 00:54:34,119
Nice.

541
00:54:35,424 --> 00:54:37,525
We can't hear you, we lost your audio.

542
00:54:37,966 --> 00:54:58,979
Marissa and I were having this great conversation where she was actually, we had breakfast this morning and she and I were chatting about just how we can possibly sort of make some sort of impact with implementing the Best Buddies program.

543
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:02,121
Marissa, I'm gonna let you take over from here.

544
00:55:07,465 --> 00:55:35,523
Well, I guess the first thing I wanted to do is just reach back out to the principals and just, I know we can't really do anything right now because of COVID and I'm not really sure it's worth trying to start Best Buddies until we can meet in person again, but I just wanted to remind them, kind of keep us on their radar and just let them know that, you know, our group does have the funding to start Best Buddies, at least, you know, for teacher,

545
00:55:37,780 --> 00:55:43,326
Not really salary, but a little bit of money for the teachers that want to facilitate it and then hopefully a little bit of money.

546
00:55:43,346 --> 00:55:47,490
To put for things that they might want to do in the club.

547
00:55:48,978 --> 00:55:57,342
So yeah, I think one of the things that might be really great that I'm thinking of is a couple of things.

548
00:55:57,522 --> 00:56:15,451
One is I would say maybe as a charge to the community, if you will, to the folks that are here now, is to maybe think about coming back to the next meeting, next month's meeting with maybe, I'm writing this note down as we're talking, with maybe,

549
00:56:16,311 --> 00:56:24,940
two suggestions of staff that you think are aligned with some of the values that we've talked about here.

550
00:56:27,062 --> 00:56:34,510
So teaching staff or other that are aligned with some of the values we talked about here, just in terms of, you know, as we're thinking about whether we want to think about

551
00:56:35,050 --> 00:56:51,255
Whether there are teachers that are, you know, folks that are interested in this type and piece or just in general I think it would be really good at every school to identify just a couple of staff or, you know, people that are at the school that we know are aligned with what we're discussing here right that are interested in building friendships and community.

552
00:56:52,296 --> 00:57:03,735
building with students with disabilities and so that we can sort of start, you know, generating a little bit of a list and we did talk last time about generating a list of of students volunteers.

553
00:57:05,662 --> 00:57:10,363
who would be willing to work on what we were calling sort of a friendship project.

554
00:57:11,663 --> 00:57:19,345
But also as we're sort of thinking about, again, community building and who are the people in the community that we know are aligned with these values.

555
00:57:19,385 --> 00:57:23,746
So I think let's be thinking both about staff and about students.

556
00:57:23,866 --> 00:57:29,207
And so I guess I would put a charge out to the subcommittee to say, maybe think about coming back with two names of each.

557
00:57:30,507 --> 00:57:36,369
staff and students or community members if students, you know, if that's too specific.

558
00:57:38,109 --> 00:57:42,110
So two of each staff or students that we know.

559
00:57:42,170 --> 00:57:50,832
Melanie, we were talking about just as a starting place, building a siblings group.

560
00:57:51,873 --> 00:58:00,481
Even for the recreation piece, but additionally possibly as a support piece for each other.

561
00:58:00,501 --> 00:58:02,123
Yep.

562
00:58:02,143 --> 00:58:11,192
So, from recreation last time as well because they really need volunteers for these adaptive programs, and we did talk about like doing that but we didn't actually.

563
00:58:12,294 --> 00:58:39,056
a sign, if you will, sort of, you know, us each coming back with sort of, so I think that's another piece is that we could come back with, if we know any siblings, names of siblings, right, and I'm happy to take these if you want to email them to me, and I'll put together, I can put together, you know, an Excel spreadsheet with one of each or whatever, but siblings, students and staff, and community members, I guess I would expand that, and community members that you know,

564
00:58:40,277 --> 00:58:57,882
through some conversations that you've had or through some work that you've done or anything else that value, you know, this topic and these issues and that we could start building sort of a community base around as we're thinking about what policy pieces we want to request for implementation.

565
00:58:59,349 --> 00:59:17,508
And then I just want to sort of put out there for some low hanging fruit, if you will, you know things that we've been bouncing around via email so you know the little bit of more the adaptive pieces around building these, these community friendship and school based friendships, I also wanted to say that I think we should ask, and, you know,

566
00:59:18,010 --> 00:59:33,318
This is something for the superintendent but certainly also something for Miss Andre or CCSR or whoever, but I think it would be also really valuable, especially for the folks that are looking at best buddies Marissa and Heather and that are willing to, you know,

567
00:59:34,213 --> 00:59:47,881
commit some funds or, and or do some fundraising to potentially observe the common ground program, or the CCS our experience piece of it.

568
00:59:48,301 --> 00:59:49,182
So, I don't know.

569
00:59:50,822 --> 01:00:02,308
whether you guys want me to reach out or Joan or Maurice, if you would reach out to either Carla or Mr. Skorka or both and see if that's a possibility.

570
01:00:02,348 --> 01:00:14,613
But I think it would be really great for them to see sort of what that looks like as we're thinking about do we want to bring in an outside organization or pilot something that's already existing at this level.

571
01:00:15,974 --> 01:00:20,117
Melanie, I can reach out to both of them this week or tomorrow.

572
01:00:20,237 --> 01:00:20,897
Tomorrow's Friday.

573
01:00:20,937 --> 01:00:28,302
But I'm supposed to meet with Mr. Skorka anyway regarding a project for one of his CCSR students.

574
01:00:28,703 --> 01:00:30,724
So we can have a conversation regarding that.

575
01:00:30,764 --> 01:00:37,509
And that might be the direction that this particular student wants to take with their direction, with their project too.

576
01:00:37,569 --> 01:00:41,291
So I will touch base with both of them in the next few days.

577
01:00:41,511 --> 01:00:41,892
Thank you.

578
01:00:41,932 --> 01:00:44,974
And Mr. Skorka did mention that student to me as well and had asked if he was

579
01:00:45,694 --> 01:00:48,635
or she is welcome to attend these subcommittee meetings.

580
01:00:48,675 --> 01:00:49,975
And obviously these are public meetings.

581
01:00:50,035 --> 01:00:56,897
So, you know, of course, but so please let him know that as well, that the student should have links to these so that that student could be coming.

582
01:00:56,917 --> 01:00:58,598
It would be really great to have a regular attendee.

583
01:00:59,978 --> 01:01:01,899
Can I say, Mel, I just wanted to say, sorry.

584
01:01:02,319 --> 01:01:08,961
I think that's a great idea because I know that that particular student is looking for a specific direction to take this project.

585
01:01:09,841 --> 01:01:11,102
So this might be a win-win.

586
01:01:13,806 --> 01:01:14,546
Good stuff.

587
01:01:14,826 --> 01:01:16,227
Charlotte, did you have something you wanted to add?

588
01:01:16,507 --> 01:01:27,390
I just wanted to add, I have a disability rights leader coming in to speak to the Common Ground group in early December.

589
01:01:27,490 --> 01:01:32,192
We're waiting for the letter days to be published to settle on the day.

590
01:01:32,232 --> 01:01:36,893
But Epic Service Warriors is a fabulous organization in Boston.

591
01:01:37,294 --> 01:01:41,735
They're an outgrowth from Triangle Inc., which is in Malden and one of our primary

592
01:01:42,513 --> 01:01:46,114
a transition services provider for young adults.

593
01:01:46,294 --> 01:01:55,256
And so Jeff LaFada is going to come in and speak about civil rights, the history of civil rights for individuals with disabilities.

594
01:01:55,476 --> 01:01:59,576
So we have that lined up and I'll let you know when we have.

595
01:01:59,616 --> 01:02:00,217
When is that?

596
01:02:01,097 --> 01:02:02,777
We're working on a date.

597
01:02:03,857 --> 01:02:07,038
Jeff has agreed to come sometime in early December.

598
01:02:07,790 --> 01:02:12,173
And we're just working on the schedule because it's the ABCD days.

599
01:02:13,133 --> 01:02:13,314
Yeah.

600
01:02:13,674 --> 01:02:15,015
And who is he coming in to do that with?

601
01:02:15,815 --> 01:02:16,756
The Common Ground group.

602
01:02:17,136 --> 01:02:17,996
Oh, good, good, good.

603
01:02:18,157 --> 01:02:18,557
That's great.

604
01:02:18,997 --> 01:02:21,359
So I do that presentation as well.

605
01:02:21,499 --> 01:02:27,963
I mean, I'm sure they're varied, but I'll be doing that with the disability awareness group that Susanna Campbell is doing, the professional development.

606
01:02:28,403 --> 01:02:31,785
So I'm really interested in seeing sort of his and what he has.

607
01:02:31,825 --> 01:02:34,427
And that is a component of the, so please let me know.

608
01:02:35,467 --> 01:02:36,147
when they're doing that.

609
01:02:36,167 --> 01:02:46,531
And that is a component of the disability awareness program that Susanna Campbell is also doing with the district around professional development.

610
01:02:46,591 --> 01:03:03,516
And she brings in family members like myself and self advocates and siblings and all these other folks who talk about this, but I do a specific human rights and disability awareness and civil rights, the history of super compelling and really powerful.

611
01:03:04,730 --> 01:03:11,773
And also can, you know, really eye opening as it's our recent history, it's our lived history process.

612
01:03:11,813 --> 01:03:12,894
So it's just a really good one.

613
01:03:12,914 --> 01:03:14,154
I'm glad to hear that they're doing that.

614
01:03:14,194 --> 01:03:14,714
That's great.

615
01:03:15,735 --> 01:03:16,875
So yeah, let us know.

616
01:03:18,676 --> 01:03:25,499
Tell us about Epic Service Warriors just a little bit because Tanya was just telling me about that at breakfast or wherever we were Tanya.

617
01:03:26,499 --> 01:03:28,680
Yeah, I actually, I'm actually gonna have

618
01:03:29,653 --> 01:03:32,654
JoJo, there's a wait list to join.

619
01:03:32,794 --> 01:03:47,901
They have to go through a specific application period, but JoJo has been invited to attend their fun Friday Zoom calls and their youth support calls on Wednesday.

620
01:03:47,981 --> 01:03:49,322
So we'll see how that goes.

621
01:03:51,383 --> 01:03:53,764
I can give a little more background on that too.

622
01:03:53,924 --> 01:03:56,585
I consider it a life-changing program.

623
01:03:58,587 --> 01:04:01,912
And you have to apply, you don't necessarily get in.

624
01:04:02,092 --> 01:04:12,346
I've had students that have been so confident after just the application and the interview process that they feel good enough to go out and get a job.

625
01:04:13,537 --> 01:04:17,740
So it is a year-long competitive organization.

626
01:04:18,281 --> 01:04:20,903
They do service projects all around Boston.

627
01:04:21,123 --> 01:04:27,508
It's kind of a heart-stopping risk to send your kid out into the world.

628
01:04:29,130 --> 01:04:32,933
There's an element of travel training that goes along with it.

629
01:04:33,033 --> 01:04:37,636
They do interviews with business leaders.

630
01:04:37,836 --> 01:04:40,178
They go to the Statehouse and learn about civil rights.

631
01:04:42,950 --> 01:04:48,271
It's quite a, they have students that participate and graduate from the program.

632
01:04:48,311 --> 01:04:57,053
I think you have to have at least, you have to do at least a hundred hours within their program of volunteer work in order to graduate and become a official service warrior.

633
01:04:57,073 --> 01:05:05,215
And students have had made lifelong friends and they also continue to go back as alumni.

634
01:05:06,135 --> 01:05:07,175
So we have students that,

635
01:05:07,572 --> 01:05:14,338
were in that program maybe eight years ago that still go back and do volunteer work with them and participate.

636
01:05:14,918 --> 01:05:17,881
So is this for students with and without disabilities or?

637
01:05:18,682 --> 01:05:31,393
It is specifically for students with disabilities, but the bar is high and there's a commitment and... What's the age requirement?

638
01:05:32,084 --> 01:05:35,466
I think it's 16 through young adult.

639
01:05:35,907 --> 01:05:54,499
So it's a nice bridge program too, particularly for our older high school students because then sometimes they stay in that because it's their year between the beginning of the end of their senior year and into life after high school.

640
01:05:55,108 --> 01:05:56,628
into our project transition program.

641
01:05:56,809 --> 01:05:57,169
Yeah.

642
01:05:57,289 --> 01:06:10,993
And, you know, to that point, I think it's really important when you're talking about, you know, friendships, community, when we're talking about friendships in the community, it's, I think for so long, I was really, you know, sort of pushing friendships for my own daughter with non-disabled children.

643
01:06:11,033 --> 01:06:11,353
Right.

644
01:06:11,553 --> 01:06:17,255
And I was never really thinking about fostering friendships for her with disabled children.

645
01:06:17,495 --> 01:06:22,596
And I just hadn't, you know, I was working so hard in inclusion that I wasn't thinking about that yet.

646
01:06:22,736 --> 01:06:24,737
I was benefiting from my friendships.

647
01:06:26,039 --> 01:06:29,761
with people in the disability community and parents of people with a disability community.

648
01:06:29,781 --> 01:06:32,783
It wasn't sort of giving her that opportunity.

649
01:06:32,843 --> 01:06:34,924
And so I learned a really important lesson there.

650
01:06:35,644 --> 01:06:45,349
And so it's really about building friendships between and with students with and without disabilities for all of the obvious reasons.

651
01:06:45,369 --> 01:06:53,573
So, you know, when we're talking about a best buddies obviously or a common ground or whatever that it's not, you know, it's not one way or the other, it's all together.

652
01:06:54,473 --> 01:06:59,896
and that we're building those friendships across those sort of identifiers, if you will.

653
01:07:01,437 --> 01:07:05,399
So this group is doing service for schools in the Boston area.

654
01:07:05,539 --> 01:07:10,441
So they're out in the community serving the general community.

655
01:07:10,461 --> 01:07:12,062
Yeah, it sounds great.

656
01:07:12,182 --> 01:07:14,043
It sounds like a little mini Peace Corps.

657
01:07:15,584 --> 01:07:16,684
Yeah, in the community.

658
01:07:16,704 --> 01:07:22,607
It sounds like a great, great organization and similar to our own gem, CCSR, which I really love.

659
01:07:24,063 --> 01:07:27,204
And I love that it's at all of our different schools.

660
01:07:27,224 --> 01:07:35,427
And I'd like to see what the demographic is for our students with disabilities participating in the CCSR programs in their individual schools.

661
01:07:36,207 --> 01:07:50,452
I do know one of the things that we addressed in some of these enrichment programs, and we had to address this I think a year ago or so, is that the requirement was at the elementary level anyway, that the CCSR students would have a partner to participate in the projects.

662
01:07:50,693 --> 01:07:51,453
And it was like, well,

663
01:07:53,455 --> 01:08:07,322
we don't have a partner, and I'm not in the school to facilitate a partnership for her, so then who is actually going to be doing that so that students with disabilities can participate in these enrichment programs?

664
01:08:07,702 --> 01:08:16,767
And I guess to that end, and so we did address this with CCSR and Mr. Skorka, and there was some training provided for administrators around, like, you don't have to have a partner.

665
01:08:17,207 --> 01:08:26,574
you can come to the CCSR program and you can be partnered or trioed with other existing groups so that, you know, it's all inclusive.

666
01:08:26,654 --> 01:08:28,636
Nobody should be, you know, left out.

667
01:08:29,076 --> 01:08:41,145
But to that end, what I was saying about sort of the low-hanging fruit around how are we identifying accommodations or the requirement for accommodations in all of these

668
01:08:42,482 --> 01:08:45,683
social programs that exist within our schools and within our cities.

669
01:08:45,864 --> 01:09:02,111
And so, you know, I know that we had spoken recently at school committee meeting around the before school and after school program and the director, Megan, and we had worked with them last year, two years ago, CPAC actually had worked with them around some language to, you know, for inclusivity.

670
01:09:02,771 --> 01:09:06,053
And they adapted that language and now they're adopting it

671
01:09:07,433 --> 01:09:16,379
they adopted the language and now they're adopting it a little bit more because I think the language they had was specific to if you're on a 504 or an IEP and you require accommodations.

672
01:09:16,479 --> 01:09:20,902
And I was saying that there are students that are, you know, not on either and require accommodations.

673
01:09:20,942 --> 01:09:25,244
So, you know, we need to be thinking about how we're creating some uniform language.

674
01:09:25,324 --> 01:09:34,370
So to the policy piece, I think one of the things that school committee could do and that this subcommittee could do is help advise on what some uniform language would look like.

675
01:09:34,908 --> 01:09:37,529
across all of our entities.

676
01:09:37,569 --> 01:10:04,000
That would include our sports programming, our community schools programming, our afterschools programming, our MFN programming, our recreational programming, any of those things, because there should be language that is inclusive, that certainly lets folks know that we don't discriminate based on any of the isms, if you will, but that also we provide

677
01:10:04,804 --> 01:10:12,627
reasonable accommodations to make sure that every person can access the life of the school and the enrichment that's involved in the school.

678
01:10:12,647 --> 01:10:25,111
So I'd like to say, I'd like to make a motion to put forward that we, that, you know, part of what we do as the subcommittee is that we create universal language around, oh, but we don't have a quorum.

679
01:10:25,211 --> 01:10:26,471
So we can't, I can't make a motion.

680
01:10:26,531 --> 01:10:29,452
I'll have to save it for next time, I guess, Paul, right?

681
01:10:29,612 --> 01:10:31,533
We don't have all our members of our school committee here.

682
01:10:34,407 --> 01:10:34,967
That's a quorum.

683
01:10:35,367 --> 01:10:37,808
We can do whatever we want, but me again.

684
01:10:38,288 --> 01:10:54,034
All right, then I'm going to say that, you know, I'd like to make a motion that one of the things that we focus on as a subcommittee is that we create some universal language around accessibility in our schools and on our recreation programs, programming through the schools in the city.

685
01:10:54,494 --> 01:10:55,295
Can I get a second?

686
01:10:55,795 --> 01:10:56,395
You got a second.

687
01:10:57,867 --> 01:10:58,488
All in favor?

688
01:10:58,508 --> 01:11:00,833
Any opposed?

689
01:11:01,494 --> 01:11:04,060
All right, so we're gonna put that forward certainly as part of our...

690
01:11:06,073 --> 01:11:07,094
our recommendations.

691
01:11:07,114 --> 01:11:09,476
And we don't have to wait till the end of the year for that, frankly.

692
01:11:09,997 --> 01:11:16,323
So we can do, we can report that out at our next meeting of the school committee, and we can take a vote at the school committee.

693
01:11:17,063 --> 01:11:21,447
And then we can just let them know that we'll, we can get back to them with the language, the specific language.

694
01:11:22,268 --> 01:11:23,389
So maybe that's another thought.

695
01:11:23,509 --> 01:11:31,737
I can do some research between now and the next meeting about what language looks like in, you know, other places, Joan, maybe, you know, if you can do some as well.

696
01:11:32,412 --> 01:11:56,278
I was going to say that I can look at, I can reach out to the before and after school, the athletics, the things with the community schools, programming, those sort of things to see what their application looks like so we can have information that I can share it with everyone so we can look at what is actually there and then what needs to be put into the specific form.

697
01:11:56,638 --> 01:11:58,861
Yeah, that would be really helpful field trip forms as well.

698
01:12:00,042 --> 01:12:11,435
Anything like that any permission forms you know anything like that that we're thinking about would be really helpful and then again where are these going to live and so this is the this is the sort of practical piece that I keep thinking about.

699
01:12:11,455 --> 01:12:14,899
And because you know we have the difficulty of.

700
01:12:15,903 --> 01:12:24,146
you know, accessibility on the Google Drive for, you know, school employees versus the general public and, you know, how we work around that.

701
01:12:24,226 --> 01:12:28,748
So I guess, you know, I'm gonna defer to the superintendent on that.

702
01:12:28,788 --> 01:12:44,695
Maybe I don't wanna put you on the spot, superintendent, but maybe we could be thinking about sort of a universal, if you will, design for our Google Drive as well, so that there is some accessibility around, you know, having our community members and our committee volunteers and other folks be able to access some of these documents.

703
01:12:46,595 --> 01:12:48,416
How would you like to address that superintendent?

704
01:12:51,436 --> 01:13:02,839
I'm going to have to look into that because as you know, at the high school level, especially we've had so many challenges so that I just don't want to prematurely say yes.

705
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:06,120
And then it has such a ripple effect.

706
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:13,082
So I would just, you know, when I heard it said earlier, I just jotted that down to try to look into a way where

707
01:13:14,145 --> 01:13:18,646
we'll be able to have the information posted.

708
01:13:19,306 --> 01:13:36,071
What I can also say is that when we have our regular school committee meetings and the minutes are approved at the regular school committee meeting for a previous meeting, then at that point in time, those minutes will end up going online.

709
01:13:36,131 --> 01:13:40,332
So there is a delay between when a meeting takes place

710
01:13:41,372 --> 01:13:54,443
and the next scheduled regular school committee meeting for the entire school committee to take a vote to approve what has been shared publicly, and then it goes up.

711
01:13:54,523 --> 01:13:58,406
So that could be an explanation sometimes for the delay.

712
01:13:58,426 --> 01:14:01,288
So I just wanted to also explain that piece to you.

713
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:02,740
Yeah, no, I appreciate that.

714
01:14:02,820 --> 01:14:05,661
And I have to double check, because I'm not sure that I've seen them up.

715
01:14:06,242 --> 01:14:09,783
And also, our webmaster, we don't have a webmaster anymore.

716
01:14:09,823 --> 01:14:12,504
I mean, people are doing double their job.

717
01:14:12,584 --> 01:14:15,685
And so there are those elements to it as well.

718
01:14:15,745 --> 01:14:30,491
But I guess in the meantime, what I'd be willing to do is to have my own version of the Google Drive for at least resources for this group that I could share in a limited way with members of this group that want.

719
01:14:31,371 --> 01:14:32,632
to have the resources shared.

720
01:14:32,692 --> 01:14:43,340
So for example, the friendship book that we were talking about or the different forms, Joan, that you're talking about, like that we can start to build at least a smaller one that's not the public version.

721
01:14:44,081 --> 01:14:52,908
And then we could be forwarding to Lisa or to Susie, the items that ultimately go public, right?

722
01:14:52,988 --> 01:14:57,531
Whether it's the minutes or, you know, obviously those automatically go public, but other pieces.

723
01:14:57,751 --> 01:14:58,492
Yeah.

724
01:14:58,812 --> 01:14:59,573
Who just raised their hand?

725
01:15:01,882 --> 01:15:02,903
Someone just raised their hand.

726
01:15:02,983 --> 01:15:03,603
Was it Heather?

727
01:15:03,643 --> 01:15:05,505
I think Heather, and then she dropped, no.

728
01:15:06,486 --> 01:15:07,026
All right, sorry.

729
01:15:08,147 --> 01:15:09,448
So I'm happy to do that.

730
01:15:09,568 --> 01:15:13,151
And oh, yeah, Charlotte was raising her hand, saying she had to leave early.

731
01:15:13,231 --> 01:15:16,013
So that's why she just texted me as well.

732
01:15:16,874 --> 01:15:28,423
So if there's nothing else, we have our next meeting at, let me just see, our next meeting is December 17th.

733
01:15:31,751 --> 01:15:35,891
want to wish everyone a happy Thanksgiving if you celebrate and celebrate safely and

734
01:15:37,058 --> 01:15:49,221
We're gonna come back to the table, if you recall, with hopefully two staff members and two students and any siblings that you can certainly email me in advance if you want, but we'll start to build.

735
01:15:49,261 --> 01:16:01,064
I'm actually happy to share, I can share a shared screen, Google Doc, that I can give you all access to as well to join and add some names to those contexts that we're all gonna hopefully bring back to the table.

736
01:16:01,484 --> 01:16:03,305
And I would also encourage you to invite

737
01:16:04,467 --> 01:16:07,070
some of those folks that you know are interested to come to the meeting.

738
01:16:07,130 --> 01:16:16,298
So for example, Marissa, the Best Buddies person that you are aware of, and certainly Carla.

739
01:16:16,378 --> 01:16:22,524
I thought I invited Carla and Mr. Droudski, but they must've had something else.

740
01:16:22,564 --> 01:16:24,466
She might've had something going on today, Melanie.

741
01:16:25,048 --> 01:16:44,862
Yeah, and I'm sure Craig too, because, you know, he normally would come, but, um, and Mr. Skorka, but just thinking about sort of in the community who, you know, that you think are interested in, in both the trauma informed schools and in the, um, and the, in the building community friendships and inviting them to the December 17th meeting would be great.

742
01:16:45,242 --> 01:16:50,566
And, um, are there any other, uh, next step items that I forgot that anyone wants to remind me of?

743
01:16:54,189 --> 01:16:54,269
No.

744
01:16:56,095 --> 01:16:58,679
Okay, then I make a motion to.

745
01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:00,862
Motion to adjourn.

746
01:17:00,982 --> 01:17:02,504
Second, Paul's motion to adjourn.

747
01:17:02,564 --> 01:17:02,785
It is.

748
01:17:02,845 --> 01:17:03,606
I just want to make note 6 23.

749
01:17:04,047 --> 01:17:06,771
Yeah, just saying.

750
01:17:09,514 --> 01:17:14,522
We're going to start a little competition, Paul with our committee members to see who can finish earliest and all our meetings.

751
01:17:14,562 --> 01:17:15,443
How do you like that idea?

752
01:17:15,463 --> 01:17:19,709
I will always lose, right?

753
01:17:20,891 --> 01:17:22,533
We'll have to figure out what the prize is going to be.

754
01:17:23,415 --> 01:17:24,096
All right.

755
01:17:24,556 --> 01:17:25,077
Good night, everyone.
